Use CivetWeb - it will work locally and also on the intranet.

To find CivetWeb go back a folder, and go to "server - intranet" folder.

Follow the install instructions in installing.md.

--------------------------------------------------------------

But if for some reason you can't then go to wiki->local 

rename config.php to offlineconfig.php

rename localonlyconfig.php to config.php

go back to the "server - local only" folder and double click pmwikiserv.bat

If it doesn't work you may need to move this folder into the main directory in the NatureVault folder directly.
