Engine Maintenance
Engine Oil Change

The engine oil drain plug is located on the bottom of the oil pan, the filler neck is located on the front

left hand side of the timing gear cover , and the oil level dipstick is located on the front left hand corner

of the engine assembly. The symbol "B" on the dipstick indicates maximum oil level, while the symbol
"H" indicates minimum oil level.

Oil Filter Maintenance

The full flow engine oil filter uses centrifugal force to remove impurities fron the oil prior to its' passing

to the engines bearing surfaces. Oil entering the filter from the oil pump first passes into the rotor
section of the filter, causing the rotor to spin at high speed. The resulting centrifugal force causes the

impurities to be forced to the outer wall of the rotor assembly, where they settle. The oil, now free of
impurities, is then fed through the central oil passage and on to the engine bearings.

To clean the filter:

1) Remove the filter cover retaining nut and sealing washer
(A), and lift off the case.

2) Remove the rotor shaft nut and thrust washer (Bl, and
carefully lift out the rotor assembly.

3) Using a permanent marker, place an alignment mark on
the rotor bowl and base. Remove the rotor assembly

retaining nut (C) and separate the bowl from the base.

4) Carefully remove all deposits from the rotor bowl and
wash all parts in a clean solvent. Ensure that the ports in
the rotor base and shaft are clean.

5) Reassemble the

unit

in reverse order, maintaining

alignment as described above. When reassembling the
rotor thrust washer and retaining nut, maintain a

clearance of .015" to .040" (.4 to 1.0 mm) between the

washer and nut.

6) After the rotor is installed, verify that it spins freely and smooth.
7) Replace the filter base gasket if damaged or badly worn.

8) Run the engine for a short period of time, at low idle and at no load, to check for any oil leakage.

When the engine is shutdown and the oil has been sufficiently warmed, the rotor should be heard

spinning, for a period of up to 30 seconds.

Engine Maintenance
Fuel Injection Pump Lubrication
The_ fuel injection pump and governor assembly are lubricated with the same type and grade of oil used
in the engine. When changing the injection pump oil or adding to it, use extreme caution to prevent
dirt from entering the pump. Wash off the pump body with solvent and wipe or blow dry prior to
removing any plugs.
To change the injection pump oil, proceed as follows:
1) Remove the drain plug (#1) located on the bottom of
the pump.

When the oil has drained completely,

clean and reinstall the plug, while checking that the
gasket is properly in place.
2) Remove the filler plug (#2), located behind the fuel
injector supply lines.
3) Remove the oil level check plug (#3), located to the
rear of the injection pump mounting flange.
4) Using a clean funnel, add oil into the filler plug bore,
until the oil reaches and stabilizes at the oil level

3

check plug hole. The oil capacity is 0.26 qts. (0.1
litre). Do not overfill.

Overfilling can cause erratic governor operation, resulting in the engine

overspeeding.
5) Clean the fill and level check plugs, replacing any gasket that may be worn or damaged. Reinstall
both plugs into the pump body.

Air Cleaner
Appropriate air cleaner maintenance is critical to the life of any engine. Always ensure that the air
cleaner and air inlet hoses are properly maintained and that no unfiltered air is permitted into the engine
by improperly fitted or damaged components.
The Belarus oil bath air cleaner has four cleaning stages and ensures a cleaning effectiveness of 99.5
to 99.7%. Maintenance of this air cleaner is as follows:
1) Check and remove dirt and debris from the precleaner (#1) fitted to the top of the air cleaner
housing (#3).
2) Release the three fastening clips on the oil sump and remove.
3) Remove the polyurethane elements (#2) fitted above the sump. Wash these elements in clean
solvent and shake each to remove any excess solvent.
4) Check the center pipe for dirt and clean as required.

3

Engine Maintenance
5) Replace the polyurethane filter elements
(#2) into the filter housing, with the
finest element on the top.
6) Fill the oil sump with the same grade
and type of oil being used in the engine.
Fill only to the lower mark on the inside
of the sump (#5).
7) Replace the sump onto the air cleaner
housing, attaching the three retaining
clips. Ensure that the sump is properly
seated on the housing.

above.

Fan Belt Adjustment
Correct fan belt tension is determined by applying a
pressure of 9 lbs. (4 kgf) to each belt by means of a
spring scale, located midway between the cooling
fan and crankshaft pulleys. The deflection of the belt
should be from 5/8" ( 15 mm) to 7/8" (22 mm).
Adjustment to the fan belt tension is made by
moving the alternator. Loosen the alternator
mounting bolts (A), the lock bolt on the adjusting
bracket (B), and move the alternator as required for
proper tension.
It will be necessary to adjust a new fan belt within
the first 60 hours or operation.

Engine Maintenance
Valve Adjustment

Valve stem to rocker clearance for both intake and exhaust valves, with a cold engine, is .012" (0.3
mm). Check and adjust valves only when the engine is cold.

To adjust valve clearance, proceed as follows:
1l

Remove the valve covers, keeping track of which cylinder head each was removed from.

2)

Rotate the crankshaft to bring cylinder#1 to the top of its

compression stroke. The symbol "BMT" (TDC) on the front crankshaft pulley will line up with the

mark on the timing indicator tab on the right hand side of the pulley. The intake and exhaust

valves on cylinder number 1 should be closed.
3)

Insert a .012" (0.3 mm) feeler gauge between the valve stem and rocker pad. The feeler gauge

should just fit between these two surfaces. If it doesn't, loosen the lock nut on the other side of

the rocker and move the adjusting screw until the proper clearance is obtained.
4)

Holding the adjusting screw with a screwdriver, retighten the lock nut. Recheck the clearance to

ensure the proper adjust has been maintained.

5)

Rotate the crankshaft 180° clockwise and check the clearance on both valves on cylinder number

6)

Rotate the crankshaft 180° clockwise and check the clearance on both valves on cylinder number

7)

Rotate the crankshaft 180° clockwise and check the clearance on both valves on cylinder number

Engine Maintenance
Fuel Filters

. The fuel filter system is comprised of a primary water separator and two secondary filters with

replaceable filter elements. The primary filter settles out water and larger particles which may be drawn

from the fuel tank. Periodically check the clear plastic bowl of the primary filter. When the sediment

has built up to a 1/2" depth, drain the filter by removing the filters drain plug. At this point also drain

the secondary fuel filters, by removing both drain hole plugs at the bottom of each filter.

PRIMARY FILTER

SECONDARY FILTER

At the prescribed intervals, dismantle the primary fuel filter and wash out the components in clean
diesel fuel.

At the prescribed intervals, dismantle the secondary fuel filters, discard the filter elements, wash out
each bowl in clean diesel fuel, install new elements & gaskets, and reassemble the unit.

Fuel Injectors

To maintain proper operation and performance, the fuel injectors require service at 1000 hour intervals.

Your Authorized Belarus Dealer has the necessary test equipment to perform this specialized service.

Do not attempt to adjust the fuel injectors yourself, without the proper test equipment and
specifications.

To remove an injector for service, proceed as follows:
1)

Clean the area around the injectors to prevent any dirt or debris from entering the combustion

2)

Remove the valve (rocker) cover.

4)

chamber.

Disconnect the fuel return and supply lines on the injector. Cover the ends of the lines with either

a plug or tape to prevent dirt or debris from entering.

Using a 27 mm open end wrench, loosen the injector retaining nut. Carefully remove the injector.

Ensure that the sealing washer located between the end of the injector body and seat in the

cylinder head is removed. Seal or plug the injector body port in the head.
5)

Seal or plug the supply and return ports in the injector

6)

Loosely replace the valve cover, to prevent contamination by dirt or debris while the injector(s)

is being serviced.

Engine Maintenance
To replace an injector, proceed as follows:
1 ) Install a new seal washer on the injector body.
2)

Position the injector in the cylinder head so that the high pressure (supply) line is at a right angle
to the crankshaft. This is essential to ensure the proper spray pattern in the cylinder.

3)

Tighten the injectors retaining nut to 53 to 66 ft lbs. (24 to 30 kgf), using a 27 mm wrench. The
final tightening torque should be from 58 to 72 ft lbs. (8 to 10 kgf).

I">..
�

Do not turn the engine over with the injector body loose (not torqued). It may be blown
from the cylinder head in this situation, causing personal injury or damage.

4)

Reconnect the return supply lines. Do not overtighten.

5)

Turn the engine over with the throttle in the shutdown (off) position. Listen for the sound of any
air escaping around the injector body and correct if a leak of this nature is discovered.

Diesel Fuel
Fuel quality affects the performance and service life of any diesel engine. Use of low quality fuel may
prove costly due to a reduced engine life, and increased service and overhaul costs. Grade No. 1 or
No. 2 fuel should be used, in acordance with ATSM D975 standards, with the final selection being
determined by the ambient air temperatures. Generally, grade no. 1 should be used from late fall to
spring and grade no. 2 from spring to late fall. If a choice of seasonal fuels is available, select the
product with the lowest sulphur content. At altitudes in excess of 5000 ft., use grade no. 1 .
irrespective of temperature. If yo·ur fuel storage tank is not fitted with an outlet filter, use a 1000
mesh filter screen when refueling.

Fuel Shut Off Adjustment

The engine will stop when the throttle lever is placed in its most forward position.
To adjust the maximum travel required to shut off the engine, set the throttle at the point where the
engine just stops, and turn the adjustment screw (#4) to prevent the throttle lever from any further
travel.

Governor Speed Adjustment

0 1 44-09 maximum no load speed is 2150 RPM, and maximum loaded speed is 2000.
D1 44-28 maximum no load speed is 1950 RPM, and maximum loaded speed is 1800.

Governor speed adjustment is prohibited. If the seal on this unit is broken for any reason, the warranty
for this engine will become immediately null and void. Should an adjustment be required, contact your
authorized Belarus dealer for assistance.

Fuel Injection Pump Removal
1)

Clean the injection pump, all lines and linkages, and the left front corner of the engine of all dirt
and debris.

11

Engine Service
2)

Disconnect the throttle linkage and all fuel lines at the pump. Cover all fuel line fittings with plugs
or tape to prevent the entrance of dirt into the system while it is open for repair.

3)

Remove the oil filler neck, and the two bolts securing the timing gear to the pump flange.

4)

Supporting the injection pump, remove the four bolts holding the pump to the engine timing cover,
then remove the pump. Cover the openings until the pump is reinstalled.

Fuel Injection Pump Installation
1)

Position the injection pump back on the rear face of the
engine timing cover, and secure.

2)

For D 144-09 engines, align the "B" mark on the pump flange
(#1) to the "B" mark on the timing gear (#2), or for 0 144-28
engines align the "H" mark · on the pump flange (#1) to the
"H" mark on the timing gear (#21, then r�install the two
bolts into the most closely aligned holes, 180 ° apart, and
secure.

3) Reinstall the throttle linkage, as well as all fuel line
connections.
41

Retime the pump as outlined on page 34.

Fuel Injection Pump Timing

1)

It will be necessary to remove the oil filler neck and the #1 injector supply line from the pump, if
not already done in the previous steps from page 33. Install a moment meter (glass eye dropper)
on the #1 pump fitting. Cylinder #1 is on the fan (front) side of the engine.

2)

Set the throttle lever to the maximum speed position. If the injection pump was removed from the
engine for service, operate the hand primer until pressure is built on the low side of the system,
then manually rotate the crankshaft clockwise, with the decompressor engaged, until no air
bubbles are visible in the fuel in the moment meter.

3) Remove the #1 valve cover. Rotate the engine while watching the intake valve. When it starts to
close, the cylinder is approaching the start of compression. At this point, remove a small amount
of fuel from the moment meter.
4) Continue turning the crankshaft until the moment meter just shows the start of fuel delivery,
indicated by a rise in fuel level. The engine timing cover pointer should line up with one of six
notches in the crankshaft pulley at the "T" mark. The correct mark to use, counting clockwise
from the "BMT" (TDC) mark, is #3 for a D1 44-09 engine, and #2 for a D 1 44-28. This indicates
the start of injection at 26 ° to 28 ° BTDC for the D 1 44-09 and 24 ° to 26 ° for the D144-28. If
the timing is correct, proceed to step #7 below.
5) If the timing is not correct, it will be necessary to make an adjustment to the timing gear/pump
flange position. Remove the two bolts securing the gear to the flange. Rotate the engine until
cylinder #1 begins it's compression stroke, then continue turning until the engine timing cover
pointer aligns with the proper "T" mark on the crankshaft pulley.
6)

With a wrench, turn the injection pump drive shaft until a rise in fuel is just noted in the moment
meter. Reinstall the two bolts, 1 80° apart, in the timing gear/drive flange assembly and secure.

7) With the proper timing verified, reinstall the injector supply line and oil filler neck. Run the engine
to ensure proper operation.

The .injector pop pressure should be adjusted to 2450 psi ( 172 kgf/cm 2).
NOTE: Do not attempt the adjust the injector pop pressure setting without the use of a proper injector
test stand.
Initial indications of injector related difficulties include misfiring, loss of power, engine overheating,
black exhaust smoke, cylinder knock, or increased fuel consumption. A faulty injector(s) can be
identified by running the engine just above low idle and loosening the injector supply line nut just
enough to allow fuel to leak. If no change in engine rpm is noted, the injector is at fault. It is
recommended that your injectors be serviced by your authorized Belarus dealer.

Fuel Feed Pump

The injection pump is fitted with a piston

-Cylinder Head
Each cylinder is fitted with an individual cast aluminum head. Although they are identical, they should
each be replaced, after service, on the cylinder from which they were removed.
To remove the cylinder head, proceed as follows:
1 ) Remove the intake and exhaust manifolds.
2) Disconnect the injector supply lines.
3) Disconnect the injector return lines.
4) Remove the air ducts attached to the heads.
5) Remove the valve covers.

6) Remove the nuts and washers from the cylinder studs.
7) · Remove the head, taking care not to disturb or damage the cylinder.
8) Remove the push rods and tubes and set aside in order so that they will be able to be replaced
in their original position.
With the cylinder head(s) removed from the engine;
disassemble, inspect all parts for wear or damage,
and repair or replace as required. When removing the
valve springs, separate the springs, caps, and
keepers so that they will be replaced on the same
valve from which they were removed.
When reinstalling the head, first torque the rocker
pedestal nuts to 45 ft lbs (6kgf). Using new gaskets
and seals, replace the cylinder head in reverse order
of its removal. Tighten the hold down stud nuts
evenly, in three stages, to the final torque of 80 ft
lbs (11 kgf). The tightening sequence is shown
below.

Decompressor
The decompressor eases starting the engine in cold weather by lifting the intake valves and
consequently not allowing compression to build in the engine.
No adjustments to the decompressor mechanism are required.
Should the decompressor assembly be disassembled for service, it is important to index the portion of
the decompressor shaft that is milled flat, to be facing up, on reassembly. The decompressor
components are illustrated below.

Cylinder, Piston, and Connecting Rods

To remove a cylinder and piston & rod set, proceed as follows:
1 ) Remove the cylinder head
2) Drain and remove the oil pan
3) Remove nuts from the connecting rod bearing caps
4) Remove the bearing caps, ensuring identification of the caps so that they will be reinstalled on
the same rods later.
5) Remove the cylinder, with the piston and rod, as an assembly. If the rod bearings remain
serviceable, keep the bearings in place with the caps on the rods.
6) Remove the piston and rod assembly from the cylinder, again keeping track of the items for
proper reassembly.
To separate the piston from the rod, remove the wrist pin circlips from the piston and slide the pin from
either end. If the pin is tight in the piston, warm it in oil to a temperature of 2 1 2 to 250°F ( 1 00 to
1 20 ° C).
Cylinder and Piston Inspection
1 ) Examine the piston and cylinder for signs of scoring. Clean any carbon buildup from the piston
ring grooves.
2) Check the gap of the piston rings in the cylinder bore. The normal gap is .01 2 to .024 in. (0.3
to 0.6 mm). If the compression ring gap is . 1 97 in. (5 mm) or larger, or if the oil control ring
gap is .01 in. (2.5 mm)or larger, replace the rings.
3) Check the fit of the wrist pin in the piston. The clearance between the small end rod bushing
and the wrist pin is a nominal .0007 to .0012 in. (0.01 9 to 0.030 mm). If the clearance
exceeds .0079 in. (0.2 mm), replace the pin and/or bushings as required.
4) Check the side clearance of the new compression rings in the piston ring land. The nominal
clearance is .004 to .005 in. (0.095 to 0. 1 35 mm). If the clearance is .020 in. (0.5 mm) or
larger, replace the piston.
5) Check the ring gap with the new piston rings as in #2 above in the old cylinder. If the limit is
exceeded, replace the cylinder.
6) Check the side clearance of the piston skirt in the cylinder. The nominal side clearance with
the piston in the TDC position is .0055 to .007 in. (0. 1 4 to 0. 1 8 mm). If the clearance is .02
in. (0.5 mm) or greater, replace the piston.
Connecting rods, wrist pins, pistons, and cylinders are all grouped by size. Each component is marked
to indicate its respective size. When installing new parts, these sizes must be properly matched.
Identification of these marks and dimensions of these parts are listed below. This information is vital
when ordering the correct replacement parts from your authorized Belarus dealer.

Note:

1) Position the bearing journal index tabs to the to the offset recess in the piston head.
2) The wrist pins should turn freely in the connecting rod. If difficulty is encountered fitting
the pin to the piston, heat the piston in oil to 2 1 2 to 250 ° F ( 1 00 to 120 ° C) and install the pin
by lightly tapping with a rubber mallet.

Pistons

Pistons are marked by a number indicating wrist pin size and a letter indicating compatibility with
cylinder size, both located on the top of the piston. The pistons are also marked on the top with one
figure that indicates weight in tenths of a gram. Pistons of the same weight must be used in the
engine.
