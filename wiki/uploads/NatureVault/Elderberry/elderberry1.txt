Chemical properties (L-ascorbic acid and total sugars content, pH, titratable acidity, and dry solid content), phenolic compounds
(total phenolics, tannins, flavonoids, anthocyanins, and flavan-3-ols) and antioxidant capacity were measured in ripe fruits of wildgrowing strawberry, bilberry, and elderberry from eastern Serbia. All three selected fruits are rich sources of nutraceuticals: vitamin
C, sugars, and different classes of phenolic compounds and their extracts expressed high antioxidant activity. Elderberry fruits
possess highest concentration of all measured biomolecules.

Introduction

The antioxidant potential of phytochemicals in health
maintenance has been increasingly recognized in recent
years. Sufficient evidence has shown that free radicals
play an important role in most major health problems
such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, and degenerative
diseases associated with aging (Zhang et al., 2015).
Polyphenols are especially important antioxidants
because of their high redox potentials allowing them
to act as reducing agents, hydrogen donors, and singlet
oxygen quenchers (Kasote et al., 2015).
Red fruits, including different berries, are characterized
by high amounts of bioactive molecules and rich
sources of natural antioxidants: phenolic acids, tannins,
carotenoids, vitamin A, C, E, folic acid, and minerals
such as calcium, selenium, and zinc. These chemical
compounds are secondary metabolites that prevent
the fruit from environmental factors that could induce
oxidation processes, such as air, oxygen, light, attacks
of phytopatogens and herbivorous animals. Phenolic
antioxidants interfere with the oxidation process as
free radical terminators and sometimes also as metal
chelators (Manganaris et al., 2013; Oanacea et al., 2015,
Hidalgo & Almajano, 2017; Šapčanin et al., 2017).

Strawberry (Fragaria sp.) is a genus of flowering plant
in the rose family, Rosaceae, commonly known as
strawberry for their edible fruits. There are more than 20
described species and many hybrids and cultivars. While
primarily valued for their taste and flavour, strawberries
also have potential health benefits. Strawberries are high
in the vitamins and mineral content, and they are also rich
in different phenolic molecules, including anthocyanins,
hydrolyzable tannins and phenolic acids (Liston et
al., 2014). Vaccinium species: bilberries (Vaccinium
myrtillus L.) and blueberries (Vaccinium corymbosum L.),
have been proven to have high phenolic content and
strong antioxidant potential (Bunea et al., 2011, Kevers
et al., 2014). Bilberries and blueberries have multiple
biological and health-promoting effects, including
anticarcinogenic, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial
effects (Johnson & Arjmandi, 2013; Salamon et al., 2021).
Sambucus nigra L. is a species from the Adoxaceae family,
known as a low growing tree. Elderberry is recognized
for its therapeutic properties such as antidiabetic and
antiviral effects, diuretic properties, and prevention of
atherosclerosis, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer
(Młynarczyk et al., 2018).

In the present study, the chemical composition, content
of phenolic compounds, and antioxidant capacity of the
three wild edible berry fruits from eastern Serbia region
were assessed by different assays. An assessment of the
correlation between the antioxidant activity of the fruits
and the phenolic components contents was performed.

Material and methods

2.1 Plant material
Fresh fruits of wild-growing strawberries, bilberries, and
elderberries were picked up manually at full maturity
in a forested area near the town of Žagubica, Homolje
Carpathian region, eastern Serbia. The samples were
kept on ice during transportation to laboratory, divided
into two subsamples for chemical and biochemical
analysis, and stored. For all spectrophotometric
analysis, the ThermoScientific Evolution 220 UV-visible
spectrophotometer was used.
2.2 Chemical composition
Dry solid content of fruits was analysed by the
evaporation method. Fresh fruits of known weights
were placed in glass dishes and dried in laboratory oven
at 80 °C until constant weight (Bradley, 2010). pH and
titratable acidity were measured by methods described
by Sadler and Murphy (2010). Results for titratable acidity
were expressed as g citric acid 100 g-1 fruit. Total sugar
(carbohydrate) content was estimated by the phenolsulfuric acid method (BeMiller, 2010). The standard
curve was constructed using different concentrations of
glucose, and the results were expressed as mg glucose
equivalents (GE) per gram of fruit (mg.GE.g-1). Content
of vitamin C (ascorbic acid, AA) in fresh wild-growing
strawberries, bilberries, and elderberries was determined
by the 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNP) method as
described by Al-Ani et al. (2007). Calibration curve was
conducted by solutions with different concentration
of ascorbic acid and results were expressed as mg of
ascorbic acid equivalent per g of fresh fruit (mg.AAE.g-1).
2.3 Phenolic compounds
One gram of edible parts of each fruit was homogenized
and extracted in 10 ml of 70% (v/v) methanol overnight.
The extracts were filtered and centrifuged at 8000 rpm
for 15 minutes. Extracts were kept in refrigerator and
used for further biochemical analysis.
The content of total phenols (TP) was determined using
a Folin-Ciocalteu reagent (Nagavani & Raghava Rao,
2010). The diluted Folin-Ciocalte solution was mixed with
20 μl of the extracts. After five minutes 400 μl of 20%
Na2CO3 solution was added. A series of standard dilution

of gallic acid was used to construct the calibration
curve. After 60 min, the absorbance at λ = 730 nm was
read on a spectrophotometer. The TP content of the
extracts tested was expressed as mg of gallic acid (GA)
equivalents per g of fresh fruit weight (mg of GAE.g-1 FW).
All samples were prepared and analysed in triplicate. The
content of total tannins was determined by the same
method as content of total phenolics after the removal
of tannins by their adsorption on an insoluble PVPP
(polyvinylpolypyrrolidone) matrix. The calculated values
were subtracted from the TP content. The total flavonoid
(TF) content in the obtained fruit samples was measured
by the aluminium chloride spectrophotometric assay
by the method described by Saha et al. (2013). Total
flavonoid content was determined from the regression
equation of the quercetin calibration curve and
expressed as mg quercetin equivalent (QE) gram of fresh
weight of selected fruits (mg of QE g-1 FW). The content of
total anthocyanins (TA) in the methanol extracts of three
selected fruits was determined spectrophotometrically
by measuring the difference in the absorbance between
solutions of pH 1.0 and pH 4.5 at absorption on 510 and
700 nm (Giusti & Wrolstad, 2001). Values are expressed as
mg cyaniding-3-glucoside (C3G) equivalents per gram
of fresh fruit weight (mg C3GE.g-1 FW). The content of
flavan-3-ols in selected fresh fruits was measured by the
vanillin assay using the daily prepared working solution
of 4% vanillin in methanol (Laličić-Petronijević et al.,
2016). The results were expressed in mg of (+)-catechin
equivalents (CE) per g of fresh fruits weight (mg of CE.g-1
FW).
2.4 Antioxidant capacity
Scavenging of free radicals was tested using a DPPH
(2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) acetone solution (Lai
& Lim, 2011). The ferric-reducing antioxidant power
(FRAP) assay was carried out according to the procedure
described by Valentão et al. (2002). The ABTS (2,2’azino-bis
(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)-diammonium
salt) assay was based on a method described by Miller
et al. (1993). A reducing power assay (total reduction
capacity-TRC) was performed by the method of Saha et
al. (2013). The standard curve for antioxidant tests (DPPH,
FRAP, ABTS and TRC) was plotted using trolox solution and
the results were expressed as mg trolox equivalents (TE)
per g of the fresh plant material (mg TE.g-1 FW). NBT (nitro
blue tetrazolium) test or superoxide dismutase-mimetic
(SOD-mimetic) activity was assayed according to the
slightly modified method of Kalaskar and Surana (2014) by
measuring fruit extracts ability to inhibit photochemical
reduction of NBT. The reaction mixture contained 1 mL
of 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.8) with
dissolved NBT, EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid),

L-methionine, riboflavin and 20 μL of the fruits’ extract.
It was kept under a fluorescent lamp for 10 min, and
then the absorbance was read at 560 nm. One unit of
the SOD activity was defined as the content of enzymes
required to inhibit reduction of NBT by 50%. The activity
of the extracts was expressed as IU SOD.g-1 fresh plant
material. NO generated from sodium nitroprusside
(SNP) was measured according to the method of
Marcocci et al. (1994). The reaction mixture containing
3 mL SNP phosphate buffered saline (pH 7.3), with or
without 40 μL of fruit extract, was incubated at 25 °C for
180 min in front of a visible light source. The NO radical
thus generated interacted with oxygen to produce the
nitrite ion (NO.) which was assayed at 30 min intervals
by mixing incubation mixture with an equal amount of
Griess reagent (1% sulphanilamide in 5% phosphoric
acid and 0.1% naphthylethylenediaminedihydro
chloride). The absorbance of the chromophore (purple
azo dye) formed during the diazotisation of nitrite
ions with sulphanilamide and subsequent coupling
with naphthylethylenediaminedihydro chloride was
measured at 546 nm. The nitrite generated in the
presence or absence of the fruit extract was estimated
using a standard curve based on sodium nitrite solutions
of known concentrations.
2.5 Statistical analysis
Results were expressed as a mean value of determinations
of 3 independent samples made in triplicates. Statistical
significance was tested by analysis of variance followed
by comparison of means by the Duncan’s multiple range
test (P <0.05) calculated using STATISTICA for Windows
version 13.2 (StatSoft, Tulsa, OK, USA). Stepwise multiple
regression analyses were used to determine correlation
among variables.

Results and discussion

3.1 Chemical composition
Berries contain a wide variety of primary and secondary
biomolecules that may help protect cellular systems from
Table 1

oxidative damage and lower the risk of chronic diseases
(Skrovankova et al., 2015). The content of dry solids, total
sugars, pH values, titratable acidity, and ascorbic acid
content of elderberry, strawberry and bilberry fruits are
shown in Table 1. Dry solid content of three selected
wild-growing fruits ranged from 10.83% for bilberry up to
22.27% for strawberry and 23.60% for elderberry. The pH
of the bilberry pulp was 3.12, which was lower than the pH
of strawberry (3.57) and elderberry (3.84). These results
are in agreement with findings of other researchers who
investigated properties of elderberry (Vujanović et al.,
2020; Zhou et al., 2020) and bilberry (Bernal et al., 2014;
Colak et al., 2016; Celik et al., 2018). Titratable acidity of
all three investigated fruits was within the same range
(1.22–1.28% citric acid) and is in good agreement with
literature data (Vulić et al., 2008; Özgen et al., 2010; Colak
et al., 2016; Celik et al., 2018). Sugar content in fruits is
an important parameter. Consumers mostly prefer fruits
with higher sugar content. There were no statistically
significant differences in sugar content between all
three selected fruits from this experiment. Total sugar
concentration ranged from 5.17 g.100 g-1 (elderberry) to
5.70 g.100 g-1 (bilberry) and 6.59 g.100 g-1 (strawberry).
Similar findings are reported by other authors. For
elderberry, Vujanović et al. (2020) reported 3.74 g of
total sugars per 100 g of fruits, Elez Garofulić et al. (2012)
reported 6.91 g.100 g-1, while Vulić et al. (2008) measured
8.88 g.100 g-1 in their samples. In plants, L-ascorbic acid
(vitamin C) has several functions: as an enzyme cofactor,
a radical scavenger, and a donor/acceptor in electron
transport either in the plasma membrane or in the
chloroplasts. In humans and animals, vitamin C functions
as a cofactor in the enzymatic hydroxylation, preventing
curvy and protects against different diseases. Currently,
most of the daily intake of L-ascorbic acid for humans
comes from fruits and vegetables (Fenech et al., 2019;
Dosedĕl et al., 2021). The highest content of vitamin C
was measured in elderberry fruits (0.30 mg AAE g-1), while
concentrations of vitamin C in strawberry and bilberry
were 0.20 mg AAE g-1 and 0.19 mg.AAE.g-1, respectively.
Literature data agrees with our findings (Vulić et al., 2008;

amounts of these compounds (9.93 mg.GAE.g-1 FW). Few
researchers detected lower amount of TT in elderberry
fruits compared to results of our research (ElezGarofulić
et al., 2012; Najda et al., 2014; Dyduch-Siemińska et al.,
2015; Vujanović et al., 2020).

Milivojevic et al., 2012; Poiana et al., 2012; Bernal et al.,
2014).
3.2 Phenolic compounds
Results of the determination of the main phenolic
compounds (TP, TT, TF, TA and flavan 3-ols) of wild-growing
strawberry, bilberry and elderberry are shown in Table
2. Different parameters, such as fruit species, cultivar,
maturity stage, harvesting time, postharvest conditions,
extraction procedure and others affect the chemical and
biochemical composition of fruits (Prvulović et al., 2016).
Role of phenolics in fruits are numerous: they actively
inhibit or stimulate physiological processes, represent
defending system against pathogens and stress, and
contribute to some of the quality properties of fruits
(aroma, flavors, color, and astringency) (Sulusoglu, 2014).
Significant differences in TP content among selected fruit
species were recorded (Table 2). Elderberry contained
the highest concentration of TP (17.40 mg.GAE.g-1 FW),
followed by strawberry (14.33 mg GAE.g‘1 FW) and
bilberry fruits (11.14 mg.GAE g-1 FW). The content of
measured TP in our experiment was higher compared
to literature data for elderberry (Özgen et al., 2010; Elez
Garofulić et al., 2012; Vujanović et al., 2020; Zhou et al.,
2020), strawberry (Wang & Lewers, 2007; Peñarrieta et al.,
2009; Dyduch-Siemińska et al., 2015) and bilberry (Bunea
et al., 2011; Milivojevic et al., 2012; Poiana et al., 2012;
Bernal et al., 2014; Celik et al., 2018). Some researchers
detected higher amount of TP in elderberry fruits
compared to results obtained in our experiment (Tumbas
et al., 2010; Colak et al., 2016).

Flavonoids has a variety of biological activities in
plants: color and aroma of flowers and fruits, to attract
pollinators, protect plants from different biotic and
abiotic stresses and act as UV filters, detoxifying agents,
signal molecules, allopathic compounds, phytoalexins,
and antimicrobial defensive components. In addition,
flavonoids have roles against frost hardiness, drought
resistance and play a role in plant heat acclimatization
and freezing tolerance (Panche et al., 2016). Significant
differences of TF content among observed fruit species
were confirmed. The highest levels of TF were found in
elderberry fruits (8.09 mg.QE.g-1 FW) followed by bilberry
(2.53 mg.QE.g-1 FW) fruits. The lowest levels of TF were
measured in strawberry (0.081 mg.QE.g-1 FW).
Anthocyanins are water-soluble phenolic compounds
that serve as plant pigments responsible for red,
purple or blue color of many plant organs. Seventeen
anthocyanidins could be found in nature, whereas
only six of them are present in most fruits: malvidin,
pelargonidin, peonidin, petunidin, delphinidin and
cyanidin. Anthocyanins are antioxidants that play a very
important role in reducing risks of different human
degenerative diseases (Hidalgo & Almajano, 2017).
Elderberry showed the greatest total anthocyanins
(TA) content of all three fruits (1.5.37 mg.C3G.g-1 FW),
followed by bilberry (3.95 mg.C3G.g-1 FW) and the lowest
TA content were found in strawberry fruits (0.29 mg C3G
g-1 FW). The present TA content values for elderberry
(Özgen et al., 2010; Elez Garofulić et al., 2012; Zhou et
al., 2020), bilberry (Bunea et al., 2011; Poiana et al., 2012;
Bernal et al., 2014; Celik et al., 2018) and strawberry
(Wang & Lewers, 2007; Dyduch-Siemińska et al., 2015) are
in agreement with other studies.

Tannins are compounds with a relatively high molecular
weight and could be divided into two groups:
condensed and hydrolysable tannins. Condensed
tannins (proanthocyanidins) are found in abundance
in fruits and fruit products and are partly responsible
for astringency and color of fruits (Skrovankova et al.,
2015). Strawberry and elderberry fruits contained similar
quantity of TT (13.41 mg.GAE.g-1 FW and 13.24 mg
GAE.g‘1 FW, respectively), while bilberry fruits had lower

the phenylpropanoid and flavonoid pathways. Flavan3-ols also have diverse biological activities, including
protection against herbivorous and phytopatogens,
and possess strong allelopathic activity (Enomoto et al.,
2020). From the results shown in Table 2 it can be seen
that bilberry fruits possess more flavan-3-ols (0.170
mg.CE.g-1 FW) compared to fruits of elderberry (0.030
mg.CE.g-1 FW) and strawberry (0.005 mg.CE.g-1 FW).
3.3 Antioxidant capacity
Within the present study, the antioxidant capacity of
three selected fruits was not uniform and depends
on assay performed (Table 3). To date, antioxidant
activities of plant extracts are measured using a panel
of assays whereby each assay has its own advantages
and limitations. It is not sufficient to use one in vitro
Table 3

assay to claim antioxidant capacity of an extract (Sadeer
et al., 2020). Elderberry extract expressed the strongest
antioxidant activity in FRAP, ABTS and NO assays,
strawberry extract in ABTS, DPPH, TAC and NBT assays,
while bilberry extract performed the highest antioxidant
capacity in TRC and NBT assays, compared with other
two fruits’ extracts. After comparing with literature data,
it is obvious that all three fruits possess high antioxidant
properties in comparison to many other fruits, crops, and
vegetables. Results of our study are in agreement with
previous works on strawberry (Wang & Lewers, 2007;
Peñarrieta et al., 2009; Najda et al., 2014), elderberry (Elez
Garofulić et al., 2012; Vujanović et al., 2020) and bilberry
(Bunea et al., 2011; Milivojevic et al., 2012; Poiana et al.,

3.4 Statistical analysis
Statistical correlation between different phenolic
compounds and applied antioxidant assays are presented
in Table 4. TP and TT revealed positive correlation with
FRAP (0.8925 and 0.7164, respectively) and ABTS (0.8793
and 0.8702, respectively) assays, TF with FRAP assay
(0.7160) while TA and flavan-3-ols expressed positive
correlation only with NO radical scavenging test (0.9074
and 0.8272, respectively). TAC and NBT assays did not
perform positive correlation with any of measured
groups of phenolic compounds. It could be assumed that
antioxidant capacity of extracts of selected fruits does
not depend on phenolic compounds present only. Some
other class of extracted molecules could play significant
role in antioxidant activity of extracts.

Conclusions

In this work, the chemical properties, phenolic
compounds and antioxidant capacity of wild growing
strawberry, bilberry and elderberry from eastern
Serbia were determined. All three fruits are high in
ascorbic acid, sugars, and phenolics content and
possess strong antioxidant activity. The elderberry
fruits had the highest ascorbic acid and TT, TF and TA
content. Antioxidant capacity of fruits appears to be
largely influenced by TP and TT contents while ability
of inhibition of NO radicals depends on the content of TA
and flavan-3-ols in samples.
