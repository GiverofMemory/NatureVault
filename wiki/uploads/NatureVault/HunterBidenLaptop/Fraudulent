Public Statement on the Hunter Biden Emails

October 19, 2020

We are all individuals who devoted signiﬁcant por<ons of our lives to na<onal security. Some of
us served in senior posi<ons in policy departments and agencies, and some of us served in
senior posi<ons in the Intelligence Community. Some of us were poli<cal appointees, and some
were career oﬃcials. Many of us worked for presidents of both poli<cal par<es.

We are all also individuals who see Russia as one of our na<on’s primary adversaries. All of us
have an understanding of the wide range of Russian overt and covert ac<vi<es that undermine
US na<onal security, with some of us knowing Russian behavior in<mately, as we worked to
defend our na<on against it for a career. A few of us worked against Russian informa<on
opera<ons in the United States in the last several years.

Perhaps most important, each of us believes deeply that American ci8zens should determine the
outcome of elec8ons, not foreign governments. All of us agree with the founding fathers’
concern about the damage that foreign interference in our poli8cs can do to our democracy.

It is for all these reasons that we write to say that the arrival on the US poli<cal scene of emails
purportedly belonging to Vice President Biden’s son Hunter, much of it related to his <me
serving on the Board of the Ukrainian gas company Burisma, has all the classic earmarks of a
Russian informa<on opera<on.

We want to emphasize that we do not know if the emails, provided to the New York Post by
President Trump’s personal aSorney Rudy Giuliani, are genuine or not and that we do not have
evidence of Russian involvement -- just that our experience makes us deeply suspicious that the
Russian government played a signiﬁcant role in this case.

If we are right, this is Russia trying to inﬂuence how Americans vote in this elec8on, and we
believe strongly that Americans need to be aware of this.

There are a number of factors that make us suspicious of Russian involvement.

Such an opera<on would be consistent with Russian objec<ves, as outlined publicly and recently
by the Intelligence Community, to create poli<cal chaos in the United States and to deepen
poli<cal divisions here but also to undermine the candidacy of former Vice President Biden and
thereby help the candidacy of President Trump. For the Russians at this point, with Trump
down in the polls, there is incen<ve for Moscow to pull out the stops to do anything possible to
help Trump win and/or to weaken Biden should he win. A “laptop op” ﬁts the bill, as the
publica<on of the emails are clearly designed to discredit Biden.
Such an opera<on would be consistent with some of the key methods Russia has used in its now
mul<-year opera<on to interfere in our democracy – the hacking (via cyber opera<ons) and the
dumping of accurate informa<on or the distribu<on of inaccurate or misinforma<on. Russia did
both of these during the 2016 presiden<al elec<on – judgments shared by the US Intelligence
Community, the inves<ga<on into Russian ac<vi<es by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, and the
en<rety (all Republicans and Democrats) on the current Senate Intelligence CommiSee.

Such an opera<on is also consistent with several data points. The Russians, according to media
reports and cybersecurity experts, targeted Burisma late last year for cyber collec<on and
gained access to its emails. And Ukrainian poli<cian and businessman Adriy Derkach, iden<ﬁed
and sanc<oned by the US Treasury Department for being a 10-year Russian agent interfering in
the 2020 elec<on, passed purported materials on Burisma and Hunter Biden to Giuliani.

Our view that the Russians are involved in the Hunter Biden email issue is consistent with two
other signiﬁcant data points as well. According to the Washington Post, ci<ng four sources,
“U.S. intelligence agencies warned the White House last year that Giuliani was the target of an
inﬂuence opera<on by Russian intelligence.”

In addi<on, media reports say that the FBI has now opened an inves<ga<on into Russian
involvement in this case. According to USA Today, “…federal authori<es are inves<ga<ng
whether the material supplied to the New York Post by Rudy Giuliani…is part of a smoke bomb
of disinforma<on pushed by Russia.”

We do not know whether these press reports are accurate, but they do suggest concern within
Execu8ve Branch departments and agencies that mirrors ours. It is high 8me that Russia stops
interfering in our democracy.
