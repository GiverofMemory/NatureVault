csum=In the order of [[Strongyloides]] [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK19795/|#]]  Not sure if this can be a parasite of humans or not but if so or even if it can be a vector for other parasites it could explain the [[tree of knowledge]] in the [[garden of eden]] since it lives in rotting fruits, perhaps the ToK was infected.  If so, [[God]] was potentially using the ToK for genetic work and thus humans using c elegans as a model organism is probably arising from them trying to play god.  It turns out c elegans is the model organism for the study of parasites [[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16454899/|#]] so yes this appears to be the model for [[parasitic worm]] [[bioweapon]] research.
