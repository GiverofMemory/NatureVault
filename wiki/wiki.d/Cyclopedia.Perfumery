text=PERFUMERY.%0aMaterials used.%0a%0aThe flowers, roots, and woods employed in perfumery are nearly all grown abroad, and even when raised in the United States are seldom used for perfumery.%0aEssential or volatile oils (p. 289) are obtained by distillation. In the case of delicate perfumes the flowers are macerated in warm oil or cold lard (enfleurage). From this grease the oil may be extracted by alcohol. Sometimes the flowers or other odorous bodies are macerated in alcohol.%0a%0aEssences are solutions of volatile oils in alcohol. The term tincture is sometimes used to express the same idea.%0a%0aThe dried flowers and rasped woods or roots are used in the manufacture of sachets.%0a%0aThe following substances are obtained from the animal kingdom: -%0a%0aMusk, a secretion of the Musk deer (Muschus moschatus), which inhabits Eastern Asia. There are three varieties. The Tonquin or Chinese is the finer, but is apt to be adulterated.%0a%0aCivet, a secretion of the Civet cat (Viveraa civeta), and%0a%0aCastor, from the beaver (Castor fiber), are used in small quantities.%0a%0aThe Essence of Mirbane and flavoring ethers are obtained by the chemist.%0a%0aLard, suet, and the fixed oils are used as vehicles.%0a%0aAlcohol employed in perfumery should be free from all smell of fusel or other oils. Atwood's (patent) alcohol is generally preferred. It is deodorized by distillation over permangenate of potassa.%0a%0aDeodorizing Alcohol.%0a%0a1. Spirit of wine, brandy, or alcohol distilled over soap lose their empyreumatic odors and tastes entirely. At about 215° the soap retains neither alcohol nor wood-spirit.%0a2. The empyreumatic oil, which remains in combination with the soap which forms the residue of the distillation, is carried off at a higher temperature by the vapor of water, which is formed during a second distillation, the product of which is a soap free from empyreuma, and fit to be used again for similar purposes.%0a%0a3. The concentration of the alcohol increases in this operation more than when soap is not employed, because this compound retains the water and the alcoholic vapors which pass over are richer.%0a%0a4. Thirty-three lbs. of soap is enough for 100 galls. of empyreumatic brandy, and direct experiments have shown that under the most favorable circumstances the soap can retain 20 per cent. of empyreumatic oil.%0a%0a5. The soap employed should contain no potassa; it must be a hard or soda soap, and ought to be completely free from any excess of fat acids or fluids, otherwise it may render the product rancid and impure. Common soap, made with oleine and soda by the manufacture of stearine candles, has satisfied all the conditions in practice.%0a%0aIf this soap is employed, it will be better to add a little soda during the first distillation.%0a%0aThe hard soda-soaps, as exempt as possible from fluid fat acids, remove completely the empyreumatic odor.%0a%0aJ.

After it has cooled, apply some folds of blotting-paper, to absorb any adhering oil, moisten the surface with water, and then cover it with the sheets of silver-leaf. It must now be allowed to dry, then cut into very thin strips, and these again divided into small pieces, about the size of a fenugreek seed.%0aSOAPS.%0a%0aHard soaps are made by boiling oils or fats with a lye of caustic soda. In soft soaps the lye is potash. Resin is used in yellow soaps, as it saves fat. Silicate of soda is now frequently used instead; it gives a white soap, which has no offensive smell, and has not the stickiness of resin soap. Prentiss' Washing and Scouring Solution is pure silicate of soda. Besides refuse fat, the palm and cocoa-nut oils are largely used as a basis for soap. Castile soap is made from olive oil, and is mottled by iron.%0aSoft Soap.%0a%0aAdd 3 galls. of rain or other soft water to 1 lb. of saponified or concentrated lye; boil it and put into it 4 lbs. of tallow or soap-fat.

Withdraw from the fire and, when sufficiently cool, add 3 1/2 oz. otto of roses, 1/2 oz. oil of cloves, 1/2 oz. oil of cinnamon, and 2 1/2 oz. oil of bergamot.

It has a beautiful pearly appearance, and makes an excellent lather with a brush, and has met with an extensive demand as a shavingsoap, especially in Paris. It is prepared thus: Take of fine clarified lard, 7 lbs.; potash lye, containing about 26 per cent. of caustic potash, 3 lbs. 12 oz.; rectified spirit, 2 oz.; essential oil of almonds, 2 drs. Melt the lard in a porcelain vessel, by a salt-water bath or a steam-heat under 15 lbs. pressure, then run in the lye very slowly, agitating continually from right to left during the whole time, when about half the lye is run in the mixture begins to curdle; it will, however, finally become so firm and compact that it cannot be stirred, if the operation is successful. The soap is now finished, but is not pearly; it will, however, assume that appearance by long trituration in a mortar, gradually adding the alcohol, in which is previously dissolved the perfume.%0aTooth Powder.%0a%0aTake precipitated chalk and powdered orris-root, each 1 lb.; carmine and powdered sugar, each 15 grs.; essence rose and essence neroli, each 60 grs.%0aTooth Paste.%0a%0aHoney, precipitated chalk, powdered orris-root, each 8 oz.; tincture of opium, tincture of myrrh, each 1 3/4 drs.; essence of rose, cloves, and nutmeg, each 1/2 dr.%0aCharcoal Tooth Powder.%0a%0aFinely powdered charcoal, sugar, each 2 oz.; oil of cloves, 6 drops.%0aAnother. - Finely powdered charcoal and red Peruvian bark, each 2 oz.; sugar, 1 oz.; oil of spearmint, 8 drops.%0a%0aCharcoal Tooth Paste.%0a%0aFinely powdered charcoal, white honey, and vanilla candy, each 2 oz.; red bark, 1 oz.; oil of rose or mint, 8 drops.

In the case of delicate perfumes the flowers are macerated in warm oil or cold lard (enfleurage). From this grease the oil may be extracted by alcohol. Sometimes the flowers or other odorous bodies are macerated in alcohol.%0a%3c %0a%3c Essences are solutions of volatile oils in alcohol. The term tincture is sometimes used to express the same idea.%0a%3c %0a%3c The dried flowers and rasped woods or roots are used in the manufacture of sachets.%0a%3c %0a%3c The following substances are obtained from the animal kingdom: -%0a%3c %0a%3c Musk, a secretion of the Musk deer (Muschus moschatus), which inhabits Eastern Asia. There are three varieties. The Tonquin or Chinese is the finer, but is apt to be adulterated.%0a%3c %0a%3c Civet, a secretion of the Civet cat (Viveraa civeta), and%0a%3c %0a%3c Castor, from the beaver (Castor fiber), are used in small quantities.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Essence of Mirbane and flavoring ethers are obtained by the chemist.%0a%3c %0a%3c Lard, suet, and the fixed oils are used as vehicles.%0a%3c %0a%3c Alcohol employed in perfumery should be free from all smell of fusel or other oils. Atwood's (patent) alcohol is generally preferred. It is deodorized by distillation over permangenate of potassa.%0a%3c %0a%3c Deodorizing Alcohol.%0a%3c %0a%3c 1. Spirit of wine, brandy, or alcohol distilled over soap lose their empyreumatic odors and tastes entirely. At about 215° the soap retains neither alcohol nor wood-spirit.%0a%3c 2. The empyreumatic oil, which remains in combination with the soap which forms the residue of the distillation, is carried off at a higher temperature by the vapor of water, which is formed during a second distillation, the product of which is a soap free from empyreuma, and fit to be used again for similar purposes.%0a%3c %0a%3c 3. The concentration of the alcohol increases in this operation more than when soap is not employed, because this compound retains the water and the alcoholic vapors which pass over are richer.%0a%3c %0a%3c 4. Thirty-three lbs. of soap is enough for 100 galls. of empyreumatic brandy, and direct experiments have shown that under the most favorable circumstances the soap can retain 20 per cent. of empyreumatic oil.%0a%3c %0a%3c 5. The soap employed should contain no potassa; it must be a hard or soda soap, and ought to be completely free from any excess of fat acids or fluids, otherwise it may render the product rancid and impure. Common soap, made with oleine and soda by the manufacture of stearine candles, has satisfied all the conditions in practice.%0a%3c %0a%3c If this soap is employed, it will be better to add a little soda during the first distillation.%0a%3c %0a%3c The hard soda-soaps, as exempt as possible from fluid fat acids, remove completely the empyreumatic odor.%0a%3c %0a%3c J.
