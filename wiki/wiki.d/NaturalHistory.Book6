PLINIUS  SECUNDUS. %0a%0a%0aCHAPTER  I. %0aPontus  Euxinus. %0a%0aHE  Pontus  Euxinus,  named  in  old  time  Axenos, %0afrom  its  inhospitable  wildness,  is  spread  between %0aEurope  and  Asia,  by  a  special  Envy  of  Nature, %0aand  an  Eagerness  to  maintain  the  Sea  in  his %0agreedy  and  endless  Appetite.  It  was  not  enough %0afor  the  Ocean  to  have  environed  the  whole %0aEarth,  and  to  have  taken  away  a  great  part  of  it,  with %0aexceeding  Rage  ;  it  sufficed  not,  to  have  broken  through  the %0ashattered  Mountains,  and  also  having  torn  Calpe1  from %0aAfrica,  to  have  swallowed  up  a  much  larger  space  than  it %0aleft  behind :  nor  to  have  poured  out  Propontis  through  the %0aHellespont,2  so  again  devouring  the  Land :  from  the  Bos- %0aphorus  also  it  is  spread  abroad  into  a  large  Space  without %0a%0a1  Mouth  of  Gibraltar. %0a%0a8  The  ideas  of  the  ancients  appear  to  have  been  confounded  in  the  wide %0a%0a%0a100  History  of  Nature.  [BooK  VI. %0a%0abeing  satisfied,  until  they  are  very  wide,  and  the  Lake %0aMoeotis  joiueth  its  ruin  to  them.  And  that  this  hath %0ahappened  in  spite  of  the  Earth,  appeareth  by  so  many %0aStraits  and  such  narrow  Passages  of  opposing  nature, %0aconsidering  that  at  the  Hellespont  the  Breadth  is  not %0aabove  875  Paces :  and  at  the  two  Bosphori  even  Oxen  easily %0apass  over :  and  hereupon  they  both  took  their  Name :  and  in %0athis  disunion  appeareth  an  agreement  of  relationship.  For %0aCocks  may  be  heard  to  crow,  and  Dogs  to  bark  from  one %0aSide  to  the  other :  and  by  the  interchange  of  Human  Speech %0aMen  out  of  these  two  Worlds  may  talk  one  to  another  in %0acontinued  discourse,  if  the  Winds  do  not  carry  away  the %0aSound. %0a%0aSome  have  made  the  Measure  of  Pontus  from  the  Bos- %0aphorus  to  the  Lake  Moeotis  to  be  1438  Miles.  But  Erato- %0asthenes reckoneth  it  less  by  one  hundred.  Agrippa  saith, %0athat  from  Chalcedon  to  Phasis  is  a  thousand  Miles;  and %0aonward  to  Bosphorus  Cimmerius,  360  Miles.  We  will  set %0adown  in  general  the  Distances  of  Places  collected  in  our  own %0aDays,  when  our  Armies  have  carried  on  WTar  even  in  the %0avery  Mouth  of  the  Cimmerian  Strait. %0a%0aBeyond  the  Straits  of  the  Bosphorus  is  the  River %0aRhebas,  which  some  have  called  Rhcesus:  and  beyond  it, %0aPsillis  :  the  Port  of  Calpas  ;  and  Sangarius,  one  of  the  prin- %0acipal Rivers :  it  ariseth  in  Phrygia,  receiveth  large  Rivers %0ainto  it,  and  amongst  the  rest  Tembrogius  and  Gallus.  The %0asame  Sangarius  is  by  many  called  Coralius ;  from  which %0abegin  the  Gulfs  Mariandirii  and  the  Town  Heraclea,  situated %0aupon  the  River  Lycus.  It  is  from  the  Mouth  of  Pontus %0a200  Miles.  There  is  the  Port  Acone,  cursed  with  the %0apoisonous  Aconitum  ;  and  the  Cave  Acherusia.  The  Rivers %0aPedopiles,  Callichorum,  and  Sonantes.  Towns,  Tium,  eight- %0aand-thirty  Miles  from  Heraclea :  the  River  Bilis. %0a%0aexpanse  of  the  ocean:  in  consequence,  probably,  of  the  creeping  manner %0aof  their  navigation.

The  Town  Mastya  of  the  Milesians  :  and %0anext  to  it  Cromna.  In  this  quarter  the  Heneti  inhabit,  as %0aCornelius  Nepos  saith,  from  whom  the  Veneti  in  Italy,  who %0abear  their  Name,  are  descended,  as  he  would  have  us  believe. %0aThe  Town  Sesamum,  which  is  now  called  Amastris.  The %0aMountain  Cytorus,  64  Miles  from  Tium.  The  Towns %0aCimolus  and  Stephane ;  the  River  Parthenius ;  the  Pro- %0amontory Corambis,  which  reacheth  a  mighty  way  into %0athe  Sea;  and  it  is  from  the  Mouth  of  the  Pontus  315 %0aMiles,  or  as  others  think,  350.  It  is  also  as  far  from  the %0a(Strait)  Cimmerius,  or  as  some  would  rather  have  it,  312 %0aMiles  and  a  half.  A  Town  there  was  also  of  that  Name : %0aand  another  beyond  it  called  Arminum  :  but  now  there  is  the %0aColony  Sinope,  164  Miles  from  Citorum.  The  River  Vare- %0atum ;  the  People  of  the  Cappadoces ;  the  Town  Gaziura, %0aand  Gazelum  ;  the  River  Halys,  which,  issuing  out  of  the %0afoot  of  Taurus,  passeth  through  Cataonia  and  Cappadocia. %0aThe  Towns,  Grangre,  Carissa ;  the  Free  City  Amisum,  distant %0afrom  Sinope  130  Miles.  A  Gulf,  bearing  the  Name  of  this %0aTown,  runneth  so  far  within  the  Land  that  it  seemeth  to %0amake  Asia  almost  an  Island :  for  from  thence  through  th^e %0aContinent  to  the  Gulf  Issicus  in  Cilicia,  is  not  above  200 %0aMiles.  In  all  which  Tract  there  are  no  more  than  three %0aNations  which  justly  may  be  called  Greeks:  which  are  the %0aDorians,  lonians,  and  ^Eolians  :  for  all  the  rest  are  Bar- %0abarians. To  Amisum  there  was  joined  the  Town  Eupa- %0atoria,  founded  by  Mithridates  :  and  when  he  was  vanquished, %0aboth  together  took  the  Name  of  Pompeiopolis.1 %0a%0a1  From  Pompey  the  Great,  who  conquered  him. —  Wern.

[BooK  VI. %0a%0aCHAPTER  III. %0aCappadocia. %0a%0aIN  the  interior  of  Cappadocia  is  a  Colony  founded  by %0aClaudius  Ccesar,  called  Archelais,  situated  upon  the  River %0aHalys.  The  Town  Comana,  by  which  the  (River)  Sarus %0arunneth:  Neo-Csesarea,  washed  by  the  Lycus :  and  Amasia, %0aon  the  River  Iris,  in  the  Country  Gazacena.  In  Colopena, %0aalso,  are  Sebastia  and  Sebastopolis :  little  Towns,  but  equal %0awith  those  abovesaid.  In  the  other  part  (of  Cappadocia)  is %0athe  City  Melita,  built  by  Queen  Semiramis,  not  far  from  the %0aEuphrates :  also,  Dio-Csesarea,  Tyana,  Castabala,  Magno- %0apolis,  Zela  :  and  under  the  Mountain  Argseus,  Mazaca,  which %0anow  is  named  Csesarea.  That  part  of  Cappadocia  which  lieth %0abefore  Armenia  the  Greater,  is  called  Meliten£ :  that  which %0abordereth  upon  Comagene,  Cataonia :  upon  Phrygia,  Gar- %0asauritis  :  upon  Sargaurasana,  Cammanen£ :  and  upon  Ga- %0alatia,  Morimen£.  And  there  the  River  Cappadox  separateth %0athe  one  from  the  other.  From  this  River  the  Cappadocians %0atook  their  Name,  having  formerly  been  called  Leucosyri. %0aThe  River  Lycus  divideth  the  above-named  new  Armenia %0afrom  Neo-Csesarea.  Within  the  Country  there  runneth  also %0athe  famous  Ceraunus.  But  on  the  Coast  beyond  Amysum  is %0athe  Town  Lycastum,  and  the  River  Chadisia:  and  still  fur- %0ather the  Country  Themiscyra.  The  River  Iris,  bringing %0adown  the  Lycus.  In  the  midland  Parts  the  City  Ziela, %0aennobled  by  the  slaughter  of  Triarius,*  and  the  Victory  of %0aC.  CcBsar.  In  the  Coast  the  River  Thermodon,  which %0aissueth  from  before  a  Castle  named  Phanaroea,  and  passeth %0a%0a1  Triarius,  a  Roman  general  under  Lucullus  in  the  Mithridatic  war,  was %0adefeated  by  the  enemy,  at  the  battle  of  Ziela,  with  the  loss  of  7000  of  his %0amen.  And  at  the  same  place,  some  years  afterwards,  Julius  Caesar  gained %0aan  important  victory  over  Pharnaces,  the  son  of  Mithridates,  deprived %0ahim  of  the  kingdom  of  Pontus,  and  entirely  ruined  his  army.  It  was  on %0athis  occasion  that  Csesar,  when  describing  the  rapidity  and  despatch  he %0ahad  employed  in  the  victory,  made  use  of  the  well-known  sentence, %0a"  Veni,  vidi,  vici,"  I  came,  I  saw,  I  conquered.—  Wern.

There  was  a  Town %0aof  the  same  Name,  and  five  others,  namely,  Phamizonium, %0aThemiscyra,  Sotira,  Amasia,  Comana,  now  called  Manteium. %0a%0aCHAPTER  IV. %0aThe  Nations  of  the  Region  Themlscyrene. %0a%0aTHE  Nations  of  the  Genetae  and  Chalybes ;  a  Town  of  the %0aCotyi.  Nations  called  Tibareni ;  and  Mossyni,  who  mark %0atheir  Bodies  with  Figures.1  The  Nation  of  the  Macrocephali, %0athe  Town  Cerasus,  the  Port  Cordulse.  The  Nations  Bechires  ; %0aBuzeti ;  the  River  Melas.  The  Nation  Macrones,  Sideni, %0aand  the  River  Syderium,  upon  which  is  situated  the  Town %0aPolemonium,  distant  from  Amisum  120  Miles:  beyond  this %0athe  Rivers  Jasonius  and  Melanthius :  also  80  Miles  from %0aAmisum,  the  Town  Pharnacea:  the  Castle  and  River  of %0aTripolis.  Also,  Philocalia,  and  Liviopolis  without  a  River: %0aalso,  the  Free  City  Trapezus,  environed  with  a  high  Moun- %0atain, 100  Miles  from  Pharnacea.  Beyond  Trapezus  is  the %0aNation  of  the  Armenochalybes,  and  Armenia  the  Greater  : %0awhich  are  30  Miles  asunder.  On  the  Coast  is  the  River %0aPyxites  that  runneth  before  Trapezus:  and  beyond  it  the %0aNation  of  the  Sanni  Heniochi.  The  River  Absarus,  with  a %0aCastle  likewise  so  named  in  its  Mouth  ;  from  Trapezus  is %0a150  Miles.  Behind  the  Mountains  of  that  quarter  is  Iberia  : %0abut  in  the  Coast  of  the  same  are  the  Heniochi,  Ampreutae, %0aand  Lazi.  The  Rivers  Campseonysis,  Nogrus,  Bathys. %0aThe  Nations  of  the  Colchians ;  the  Town  Matium,  the %0aRiver  Heracleum,  and  a  Promontory  of  the  same  Name ; %0aand  the  most  renowned  (River)  of  Pontus,  called  Phasis. %0aThis  River  riseth  out  of  the  Moschian  Mountains,  and  for %0a38  Miles  and  a  half  is  Navigable  for  great  Vessels.  And %0athen  for  a  great  way  it  carrieth  smaller  Vessels  ;  having %0a%0a1  The  practice  of  tattooing  is  general  through  the  islands  of  the %0aSouthern  Ocean ;  the  inhabitants  of  which,  however,  were  not  known  to %0aPliny.  But  it  is  also  practised,  even  in  our  day,  by  the  people  of  Burma, %0aand  perhaps  in  other  nations  of  the  East.  The  same  practice  is  again %0areferred  to  in  b.  vii.  c.  11. —  Wern.  Club. %0a%0a%0a104  History  of  Nature.  [BooK  VI. %0a%0aover  it  120  Bridges.  It  had  many  Towns  upon  its  Banks; %0athe  most  celebrated  being  Tyritacen,  Cygnus,  and  Phasis, %0asituated  at  its  very  Mouth.  But  the  most  illustrious  was %0aj£a,  fifteen  Miles  from  the  Sea  :  where  Hippos  and  Cyanos, %0atwo  very  great  Rivers,  coming  from  different  Parts,  flow  into %0ait.  Now  it  possesseth  Surium  only,  which  taketh  its  Name %0afrom  the  River  Surium,  that  runneth  into  it.  And  thus  far %0awe  said  that  Phasis  was  capable  of  being  navigated  by  great %0aShips.  And  it  received)  other  Rivers,  remarkable  for  size %0aand  number,  among  which  is  the  River  Glaucus.  In  the %0aMouth  of  this  River  (Phasis)  there  are  Islands  without  a %0aName.  It  is  distant  from  Bsarus  75  Miles.  Being  past %0aPhasis,  there  is  another  River  called  Charien  ;  the  Nation  of %0athe  Salae,  named  in  old  Time  Phthirophagi  and  Suani ;  the %0aRiver  Cobus,  which  issueth  out  of  Caucasus,  and  runneth %0athrough  the  Country  of  the  Suani.  Then  Rhoas  ;  the  region %0aEcrectic£  :  the  Rivers  Sigania,  Tersos,  Atelpos,  Chrysorrhoas, %0aand  the  Nation  Absilse:  the  Castle  Sebastopolis,  a  hundred %0aMiles  from  Phasis  ;  the  Nation  of  the  Sanigares,  the  Town %0aCygnus,  the  River  and  Town  called  Pityus.  And  last  of  all, %0athe  Nations  of  the  Heniochae,  which  have  many  Names. %0a%0aCHAPTER  V. %0a%0aThe  Region  of  Colchis,  the  Achai,  and  other  Nations  in %0athat  Tract. %0a%0aNEXT  followeth  the  region  of  Colchis,  which  is  likewise %0ain  Pontus  :  wherein  the  craggy  Summits  of  the  Caucasus %0awind  and  turn  toward  the  Rhiphsean  Mountains,  as  hath  been %0ahinted  ;  on  the  one  side  bending  down  toward  the  Euxinus %0aand  Moeotis ;  and  on  the  other  inclining  to  the  Caspian  and %0aHircanian  Seas.  The  remainder  of  the  Coasts  are  occupied  by %0asavage  Nations,as  the  Melanchlseni,  the  Choruxi;  Dioscurias, %0aa  City  of  the  Colchi,  near  the  River  Anthemus,  now  lying %0awaste,  although  it  was  so  renowned  in  Time  past,  that  by  the %0areport  of  Timosthenes  there  were  settled  therein  300  Nations %0awhich  used  distinct  Languages.  And  afterwards  our  Ro- %0amans were  forced  to  provide  130  Interpreters  for  the  Traffic %0a%0a%0aBOOK  VI.]  History  of  Nature.  105 %0a%0awith  this  People.  Some  think  that  it  was  first  founded  by %0aAmphitus  and  Telchius,  who  had  the  charge  of  the  Chariots %0aof  Castor  and  Pollux  .-1  for  certain  it  is,  that  the  fierce  Nation %0aof  the  Heniochi  are  from  them  descended.  Being  past %0aDioscurias,  there  is  the  Town  Heraclium,  which  from  Sebas- %0atopolis  is  80  Miles  distant.  The  Achaei,  Mardi,  and  Car- %0acetae :  after  them  the  Serri,  and  Cephalotomi.  Far  within %0athat  Tract  stood  the  very  wealthy  Town  Pitius,  which  by  the %0aHeniochians  was  plundered.  On  the  back  part  thereof %0ainhabit  the  Epageritse,  a  People  of  the  Sarmatae,  upon  the %0atops  of  the  Caucasus :  after  which  the  Sauromatae.  Hither %0ahad  fled  King  Mithridates  in  the  time  of  Prince  Claudius, %0aand  he  made  report  that  the  Thali  dwell  thereby,  and  border %0aEastward  upon  the  very  opening  of  the  Caspian  Sea:  which %0abecometh  Dry  when  the  Sea  ebbeth.  But  on  the  Coast %0anear  to  the  Cercetae  is  the  River  Icarusa,  with  a  Town  and %0aRiver  called  Hierum,  136  Miles  from  Heracleum.  Then %0acome  ye  to  the  Promontory  Cronea,  in  the  steep  Ridge %0aof  which  the  Toretae  inhabit.

But  the  Length %0aof  the  Peninsula  itself,  which  stretcheth  out  between  the %0aLakes  Pontus  and  Moeotis  is  not  above  87  Miles,  and  the %0aBreadth  in  no  place  less  than  two  Acres  of  Land.  They  call %0ait  Eione.  The  very  Coasts  of  the  Bosphorus,  both  of  Asia %0aand  Europe,  are  curved  towards  the  Moeolis.  The  Towns  in %0a%0a1  There  is  frequently  occasion  to  remark,  that  Pliny  speaks  of  the %0adeities  of  his  country,  as  if  it  was  an  acknowledged  fact  that  they  were %0aonce  living  men.  -ZEolus,  Hercules,  and  even  Jupiter,  are  so  regarded ; %0aand  as  he  speaks  of  the  impiety  of  this  opinion,  b.  vii.  c.  47,  when  applied %0ato  some  particular  cases,  we  are  at  liberty  to  believe  that  his  regard  for %0athe  established  heathenism  of  his  country  was  exceedingly  slight. — %0aWern.

Close  by  is  Stratilia  (or %0aStratoclea),  Phanagoria,  and  Apaturos,  which  is  almost  un- %0apeopled:  and  last  of  all,  in  the  mouth,  Cimmerius,  formerly %0acalled  Cerberian. %0a%0aCHAPTER  VII. %0aNations  about  Mceotis. %0a%0aBEYOND  Cimmerium  is  the  Lake  Moeotis,  spoken  of  be- %0afore in  Europe.  Beyond  Cimmerium  inhabit  the  Mceotici, %0aVati,  Serbi,  Archi,  Zingi,  and  Psesii.  After  this  you  come %0ato  the  River  Tanais,  which  runneth  with  two  Mouths :  and %0aon  the  sides  of  it  dwell  the  Sarmatae,  descended,  as  they  say, %0afrom  the  Medi :  but  themselves  divided  into  many  Races. %0aAnd  first  the  Sauromatae,  surnamed  Gynaecocratumeni,  from %0awhence  the  Amazons  are  provided  with  Husbands.  Next  to %0athem  are  the  Euazae,  Cottae,  Cicimeni,  Messeniani,  Costo- %0abocci,  Choatrae,  Zigae,  Dandari,  Thussageae,  and  Turcae,  even %0aas  far  as  the  Wilderness,  rough  with  woody  Valleys.  Be- %0ayond them  are  the  Arimphaei,  who  live  upon  the  Riphaaan %0aMountains.  The  Tanais  itself  the  Scythians  call  Silys  ;  and %0aMoeotis  they  name  Temerinda,1  that  is  to  say,  the  Mother  of %0athe  Sea.  There  stood  also  a  Town  at  the  mouth  of  Tanais. %0aThe  Lares  first  inhabited  the  Borders :  afterwards  the  Clazo- %0amenii  and  Moeones:  and  in  process  of  time  the  Panti- %0acapenses.  Some  Authors  write,  that  about  Moeotis  toward %0athe  higher  Mountains  Ceraunii,  the  following  Nations  inhabit %0aon  the  Coast,  the  Napaeae :  and  above  them  the  Essedones, %0ajoining  on  the  Colchi,  and  the  tops  of  the  Mountains.  After %0athem  the  Carmacae,  the  Orani,  Antacse,  Mazacae,  Ascantici, %0aAcapeatae,  Agagammatae,  Phycari,  Rhimosoli,  and  Asco- %0a%0a1  It  is  easy  to  discern  that  many  of  the  names  of  nations  mentioned %0aby  Pliny  are  not  those  which  the  people  themselves  would  have  recog- %0anised; but  Greek  descriptive  designations.  But  the  word  "  Temerinda" %0ais  believed  to  have  been  u  Scythian,"  and  to  be  rightly  interpreted  by  the %0aauthor.  Daleschamp  supposes  the  true  expression  to  be  "  Themers-end," %0aor,  in  modern  terms,  "  Dess-maers-end." — Wern.

Along %0athe  River  Lagoiis,  issuing  out  of  the  Mountains  Cathei,  and %0ainto  which  Opharus  runneth,  are  these  Nations :  the  Cau- %0acadae  and  the  Opharitae :  the  River  Menotharus,  and  Imitues %0adivided  from  the  Mountains  Cissii,  which  passeth  among  the %0aAgedi,  Carnapae,  Gardei,  Accisi,  Gabri,  and  Gregari :  and %0aabout  the  source  of  this  River  Imitues,  the  Imitui  and  Apar- %0atheni.  Others  say  that  the  Suitae,  Auchetae,  Satarnei,  and %0aAsampatse,  overflowed  this  Part;  the  Tanaitae  and  Ne- %0apheonitae  were  slain  by  them  to  a  Man.  Some  write,  that %0athe  River  Opharius  runneth  through  the  Canteci  and  the %0aSapaei:  and  that  the  River  Tanais  traversed  through  the %0aPhatarei,  Herticei,  Spondolici,  Synthietae,  Amassi,  Issi, %0aCatazeti,  Tagori,  Catoni,  Neripi,  Agandei,  Mandarei,  Satur- %0achei,  and  Spalei. %0a%0aCHAPTER  VIII. %0aCappadocia. %0a%0aWE  have  gone  through  the  Nations  and  Inhabitants  of %0athe  Coasts  of  the  Mediterranean  Sea.  Now  are  we  to  speak %0aof  the  People  inhabiting  the  Inland  Parts :  wherein  I  shall %0aadvance  many  things  different  from  the  ancient  Geographers : %0abecause  I  have  made  diligent  Search  into  the  state  of  those %0aRegions,  especially  by  enquiry  of  Domitius  Corbulo,  in  regard %0aof  the  things  done  by  himself,  and  also  of  the  Kings  who %0acame  from  thence  as  Petitioners,  and  of  those  King's  Sons %0athat  were  Hostages.  And  we  will  begin  with  the  Nation  of %0athe  Cappadocians.  This  is  a  Country  that  of  all  which  bound %0aupon  Pontus,  reacheth  farthest  within  the  Land  :  for  on  the %0aleft  Hand  it  passeth  by  the  Greater  and  Less  Armenia,  and %0aComagene :  and  on  the  right,  all  those  Nations  in  Asia %0abefore-named  :  being  overflowed  with  a  Multitude  of  People : %0aand  with  great  Might  climbing  up  Eastward  to  the  Tops  of %0aTaurus,  it  passeth  Lycaonia,  Pisidia,  and  Cilicia  :  and  with %0athat  quarter  which  is  called  Cataonia,  it  pierceth  above  the %0aTract  of  Antiochia,  and  reacheth  as  far  as  to  its  Region  Cyr- %0a%0a%0a108  History  of  Nature.

And  therefore  the  Length  of  Asia  there  may  con- %0atain 1250  Miles,  and  the  Breadth  640. %0a%0aCHAPTER  IX. %0aArmenia,  the  Greater  and  Less. %0a%0aTHE  Greater  Armenia,  beginning  at  the  Mountains  Pa- %0ariedri,  is  divided  from  Cappadocia  by  the  River  Euphrates,  as %0ahath  been  said  before :  and  where  the  River  Euphrates %0aturneth,  from  Mesopotamia  by  the  River  Tigris,  scarcely  less %0arenowned  than  the  other.  It  poureth  forth  both  these  Rivers, %0aand  constitutes  the  beginning  of  Mesopotamia,  which  is  situ- %0aated between  them  both.  The  Land  which  lieth  between  is %0apossessed  by  the  Arabs  Orei.  In  this  manner  it  extendeth  its %0aBorder  to  Adiabene.  Beyond  this,  being  hemmed  in  with %0aMountains  that  stand  across  it,  it  spreadeth  its  Breadth  on %0athe  left  Hand  to  the  River  Cyrus  :  and  then  across  to  the %0aRiver  Araxes :  but  it  carrieth  its  Length  to  the  Lesser  Ar- %0amenia, being  separated  from  it  by  the  River  Absarus,  which %0afalleth  into  the  Poritus  :  and  by  the  Mountains  Pariedri,  from %0awhich  the  River  Absarus  issueth.  The  River  Cyrus  springeth %0ain  the  Mountains  Heniochii,  which  some  have  called  Co- %0araxici.  The  Araxes  issueth  out  of  the  same  Mountain  from %0awhence  Euphrates  cometh,  and  there  is  not  above  the  Space %0aof  six  Miles  between  them.  This  River  Araxes  is  augmented %0awith  the  River  Musis ;  and  then  itself  loseth  its  Name,  and,  as %0amost  have  thought,  is  carried  by  the  River  Cyrus  into  the  Cas- %0apian Sea.  These  Towns  are  famous  in  the  Lesser  (Armenia) ; %0aCsesarea,  Aza,  and  Nicopolis.  In  the  Greater  is  Arsamote, %0anear  the  River  Euphrates  ;  and  Carcathiocerta,  upon  the %0aTigris.  In  the  higher  Country  is  Tigranocerta,  but  in  the %0aPlain,  near  the  Araxes,  Artaxata.  Aufidius  saith,  that  both %0athe  Armenise  contain  in  all  500  Miles.  Claudius  Ccesar %0areporteth,  that  in  Length  from  Dascusa  to  the  Confines  of %0athe  Caspian  Sea  is  1300  Miles,  and  in  Breadth  half  as  much, %0afrom  Tigranocerta  to  Iberia.  This  is  well  known,  that  it  is %0adivided  into  Prefectures,  which  they  call  Strategies  ;  and %0asome  of  them  in  old  time  were  as  large  as  Kingdoms  :  the %0a%0a%0aBOOK  VI.]  History  of  Nature.  109 %0a%0aNumber  being  120,  with  barbarous  Names.  It  is  enclosed %0aEastward  with  Mountains,  but  neither  the  Ceraunii,  nor  the %0aRegion  Adiabene,  do  immediately  border  on  it.  The  Country %0aof  the  Sopherii  lieth  between  :  next  are  the  Mountains  Ce- %0araunii ;  and  beyond  them  dwell  the  Adiabeni.  But  through %0athe  flat  Valleys  the  next  Neighbours  to  Armenia  are  the %0aMenobardi  and  Moscheni.  The  River  Tigris  and  steep %0aMountains  encompass  Adiabene.  On  the  left  Hand  its %0aRegion  is  of  the  Medians,  and  the  Prospect  of  the  Caspian %0aSea.  This  is  poured  in  from  the  Ocean  (as  we  shall  shew  in %0aits  place),  and  is  enclosed  wholly  within  the  Mountains  of %0aCaucasus.  We  will  now  speak  of  the  Inhabitants  of  these, %0athrough  the  Confine  of  Armenia. %0a%0aCHAPTER  X. %0aAlbania  and  Iberia. %0a%0aTHE  Nation  of  the  Albani  inhabit  all  the  plain  Country %0afrom  the  River  Cyrus.  Beyond  it  is  the  Region  of  the  Iberes, %0awho  are  separated  from  the  Albani  by  the  River  Alazon, %0awhich  runneth  down  from  the  Caucasian  Mountains  into  the %0aCyrus.  The  strong  Towns  of  Albania  :  Cabalaca  ;  of  Iberia, %0aHarmastis,  near  the  River  Neoris :  the  Region  Thasie,  and %0aTriare,  as  far  as  to  the  Mountains  Partedori.  Beyond  them %0aare  the  Deserts  of  Colchis:  and  on  the  side  of  them  which %0alieth  toward  the  Ceraunii  the  Armenochalybes  inhabit :  and %0athe  Tract  of  the  Moschi  to  the  River  Iberus,  that  floweth  into %0athe  Cyrus.  Beneath  them,  inhabit  the  Sacassani,  and  beyond %0athem  the  Macrones,  who  reach  to  the  River  Absarus.  Thus %0athe  Plain  and  the  hanging  of  the  Hills  are  inhabited.  Again, %0afrom  the  Frontiers  of  Albania,  in  all  the  front  of  the  Moun- %0atains are  the  savage  Nations  of  the  Sylvi ;  and  beneath  them, %0aof  the  Lubieni,  and  so  forward  the  Diduri,  and  Sodii. %0a%0aCHAPTER  XI. %0aThe  Gates  of  the  Caucasus. %0a%0aBEYOND  the  Sodii  are  the  Gates  of  Caucasus,  which  many %0ahave  very  erroneously  called  Caspise  Portae,  or  the  Caspian %0a%0a%0a110  History  of  Nature.  [BooK  VI. %0a%0aGates :  a  mighty  Piece  of  Nature's  Work,  by  suddenly  cleav- %0aing asunder  those  Mountains,  where  the  Gates  were  barred %0aup  with  iron  Bars,  whilst  under  the  midst  thereof,  the  River %0aDyriodorus  runneth :  and  on  this  Side  of  it  standeth  a  formi- %0adable Castle  called  Cumania,  situated  upon  a  Rock,  able  to %0aarrest  the  Passage  of  a  very  numerous  Army;  so  that  in  this %0aPlace,  by  means  of  these  Gates,  one  Part  of  the  World  is %0aexcluded  from  the  other  :  and  chiefly  over-against  Harmastis, %0aa  Town  of  the  Iberi.  Beyond  the  Gates  of  Caucasus,  through %0athe  Mountains  Gordyei,  the  Valli  and  Suarrii,  uncivilised %0aNations,  are  employed  only  in  the  Mines  of  Gold.  Beyond %0athem  as  far  as  to  the  Pontic  Sea,  are  many  Races  of  the %0aHeniochi ;  and  soon  after,  of  the  Achaei.  And  thus  much %0aconcerning  this  Tract  of  the  Lands  among  the  most  re- %0anowned. Some  have  set  down,  that  between  Pontus  and  the %0aCaspian  Sea,  it  is  not  above  375  Miles.  Cornelius  Nepos %0asaith  it  is  but  150;  into  such  Straits  is  Asia  driven  again. %0aClaudius  Ccesar  hath  reported,  that  from  the  Cimmerian %0aBosphorus  to  the  Caspian  Sea,  is  150  Miles;  and  that  Seleucus %0aNicator  purposed  to  cut  the  Land  through,  at  the  Time %0awhen  he  was  slain  by  Ptolomceus  Ceraunus.  It  is  almost %0acertain,  that  from  the  Gates  of  Caucasus  to  Pontius  is %0a200  Miles. %0a%0aCHAPTER  XII. %0a%0aIslands  in  the  Pontus. %0a%0aIN  Pontus  lie  the  Islands  Planctse,  otherwise  Cyaneae  or %0aSymplcgades.  Then  Apollonia,  named  also  Thynnias,  for %0aDistinction  sake  from  that  other  so  named  in  Europe  :  it  is %0afrom  the  Continent  one  Mile,  and  in  Circuit  three.  And %0aover-against  Pharnacea  is  Chalceritis,  which  the  Greeks %0acalled  Aria,  sacred  to  Mars ;  wherein  are  Birds  which  fight %0awith  a  Blow  of  their  Wings  against  others  that  come %0a%0athither. %0a%0aCHAPTER  XIII. %0a%0aNations  on  the  Scythian  Ocean. %0a%0aHAVING  thus  discoursed  of  all  the  Countries  in  the  inte- %0arior of  Asia,  let  us  now  determine  to  pass  over  the  Rhiphsean %0a%0a%0aBOOK  V I .]  History  of  Nature.  1  ]  1 %0a%0aMountains,  and  discover  the  Coasts  of  the  Ocean  which  lie %0aon  the  right  hand.  Asia  is  washed  by  this  Ocean  on  three %0aSides :  on  the  North  Side  is  the  Scythian :  on  the  East  it  is %0acalled  Eous :  and  from  the  South  they  name  it  the  Indian. %0aAnd  according  to  the  various  Gulfs,  and  the  Inhabitants,  it  is %0adivided  into  many  Names.  But  a  great  part  of  Asia  toward %0athe  North  hath  in  it  extensive  Wildernesses,  by  reason  of  the %0aviolence  of  its  frozen  Star.  From  the  extreme  North  to  the %0aNorth-east  are  the  Scythians.  Beyond  whom,  and  the  very %0apoint  of  the  North  Pole,  some  have  placed  the  Hyperborei ; %0aof  whom  we  have  spoken  at  large  in  the  Treatise  of  Europe. %0aThe  first  Promontory  that  you  meet  with  in  the  Country %0aCeltica  is  named  Lytarmis :  and  then  the  River  Carambucis, %0awhere,  by  the  forcible  influence  of  the  Stars,  the  Mountains %0aRhiphaei  are  deprived  of  their  ragged  Tops.  And  there  we %0ahave  heard  that  there  are  a  People  named  Arimphaei:  a %0aNation  not  much  unlike  the  Hyperborei.  They  have  their %0aHabitations  in  Forests  ;  their  Food  is  Berries  ;  both  Women %0aand  Men  count  it  a  shame  to  have  Hair ;  mild  in  their  man- %0aners; and  therefore,  by  report,  they  are  held  to  be  sacred, %0aand  to  be  inviolable  even  by  those  wild  People  that  dwell %0anear  them  ;  neither  do  they  respect  them  only,  but  also  those %0awho  fly  to  them.  At  some  distance  beyond  them  are  the %0aScythians,1  as  well  the  Cimmerii,  Cicianthi,  and  Georgi ; %0aand  the  Nation  of  the  Amazons.  These  reach  to  the  Caspian %0aand  Hircanian  Sea :  for  it  breaketh  forth  from  the  Scythian %0aOcean,2  toward  the  back  parts  of  Asia,  and  is  called  many %0aNames  by  the  neighbouring  Inhabitants,  but  especially  by %0atwo  of  the  most  celebrated,  the  Caspian  and  Hircanian. %0aClitarchus  is  of  opinion  that  this  Sea  is  full  as  great  as  the %0a%0a1  At  this  day,  the  Moschovites,  white  and  black  Russians,  Georgians, %0aAmazonians,  and  the  less  Tartary. —  Wern.  Club. %0a%0aa  Strabo  (lib.  xi.)  entertains  the  same  erroneous  opinions  respecting %0athe  Caspian  Sea.  That  both  these  intelligent  writers,  as  well  as  other %0aancient  geographers,  should  have  been  so  mistaken  is  the  more  extraor- %0adinary, as  Herodotus  (lib.  i.  203)  had  given  a  just  description  of  it  long %0abefore.  "  The  Caspian  Sea,"  he  says,  "  is  a  sea  of  itself,  which  does  not %0amingle  with  any  other." — Wern.  Club. %0a%0a%0a1.12  History  of  Nature.  [BooK  VI. %0a%0aPontus  Euxinus.  And  Eratosthenes  setteth  down  the  mea- %0asure of  it  as  being  from  East  to  South,  along  the  Coast  of %0aCadusia  and  Albania,  5400  Stadia :  from  thence  by  the %0aAratiatici,  Amarbi,  and  Hircanii,  to  the  mouth  of  the  River %0aZonus,  4800  Stadia :  from  it  to  the  mouth  of  the  Jaxartes, %0a2400  Stadia:  which  being  put  together  amount  to  1575 %0aMiles.  Artemidorus  counteth  less  by  25  Miles.  Agrippa,  in %0alimiting  the  Circuit  of  the  Caspian  Sea,  and  the  Nations %0aaround  it,  and  Armenia  with  them,  from  the  East  with  the %0aOcean  of  the  Seres,  Westward  with  the  Mountains  of  Cau- %0acasus, on  the  South  side  with  the  Mountain  Taurus,  and  on %0athe  North  with  the  Scythian  Ocean,  hath  written,  That  the %0awhole,  so  far  as  is  known,  may  contain  in  Length  590  Miles, %0aand  290  in  Breadth.  There  want  not  others  who  say,  That %0athe  whole  Circuit  of  that  Sea,  from  the  Strait  is  2500  Miles. %0aThis  throat  is  very  narrow  where  it  bursts  forth,  but  exceed- %0aingly long  :  but  where  it  beginneth  to  enlarge  it  fetcheth  a %0aCompass  withlunated  Horns,  and  after  the  manner  of  a  Scy- %0athian Bow,  as  M.  Varro  saith,  it  windeth  along  from  its %0aMouth  toward  the  Lake  Moeotis.  The  first  Gulf  is  called %0aScythicus ;  for  the  Scythians  inhabit  on  both  Sides,  and  by %0ameans  of  the  narrow  Straits  between  have  business  one  with %0aanother :  for  on  one  side  are  the  Nomades  and  Sauromatae, %0awith  many  Names :  and  on  the  other,  the  Abzoae,  who  have %0ano  fewer  denominations.  At  the  entry  of  this  Sea  on  the %0aright  hand,  the  Udini,  a  People  of  the  Scythians,  dwell %0aupon  the  very  point  of  these  Straits  :  and  then  along  the %0aCoast,  the  Albani,  descended  (as  they  say)  from  Jason ; %0awhere  the  Sea  that  lieth  before  them  is  called  Albanum. %0aThis  Nation  is  spread  also  upon  the  Mountains  of  Caucasus %0ato  the  River  Cyrus,  and  descendeth,  as  hath  been  said,  to  the %0aborder  of  Armenia  and  Iberia.  Above  the  Maritime  Coasts %0aof  Albania  and  the  Nation  of  the  Udini,  the  Sarmatse,  called %0aUtidorsi,  and  Atoderes,  are  planted  :  and  behind  them  the %0aSauromatides,  Amazons,  already  pointed  out.  The  Rivers  of %0aAlbania,  which  fall  into  the  Sea,  are  Cassios  and  Albanos : %0aand  then  Carnbises,  which  hath  its  Head  in  the  Caucasian %0aMountains  :  and  soon  after  Cyrus,  which  ariseth  out  of  the %0a%0a%0aBOOK  VI.]  History  of  Nature.  113 %0a%0aMountains  Corax,  as  is  before  said.  Agrippa  writeth  that %0athis  whole  Coast,  from  the  lofty  and  inaccessible  Mountains %0aof  Caucasus,  containeth  425  Miles.  Beyond  the  Cyrus,  the %0aCaspian  Sea  beginneth  to  take  that  Name ;  and  the  Caspii %0adwell  there.  And  here  the  error  of  many  is  to  be  corrected, %0aeven  of  those  who  were  lately  with  Corbulo  in  Armenia  with %0athe  Army  :  for  they  called  those  Gates  of  Caucasus,  of  which %0awe  spoke  before,  the  Caspian  Gates  of  Iberia :  and  the  Maps %0aand  Descriptions  which  are  painted  and  sent  from  thence, %0ahave  that  Name  written  on  them.  Likewise  the  threatening %0aof  Prince  JVero,  when  he  sought  to  gain  those  Gates,  which %0athrough  Iberia  lead  into  Sarmatia,  made  mention  of  the %0aGates  Caspise ;  which  had  scarcely  any  Passage  by  reason %0aof  the  Mountains  so  closely  approaching  each  other.  There %0aare  other  Gates  near  the  Caspian  Sea,  that  join  upon  the %0aCaspian  Nations,  which  could  not  have  been  distinguished %0afrom  the  other  but  by  the  relation  of  those  that  accompanied %0aAlexander  the  Great  in  his  Expeditions.  For  the  Kingdoms %0aof  the  Persians,  which  at  this  day  we  take  to  be  those  of %0athe  Parthians,  are  elevated  between  the  Persian  and  Hir- %0acanian  Seas  upon  the  Mountains  of  Caucasus  ;  in  the  Descent %0aof  which  on  both  sides  bordering  upon  Armenia  the  Greater, %0aand  on  that  part  of  the  front  which  vergeth  to  Comagene,  it %0ajoineth  (as  we  have  said)  with  Sephenise :  and  upon  it  bor- %0adereth  Adiabene,  the  beginning  of  the  Assyrians  :  Arbelitis, %0awhich  is  nearest  to  Syria,  is  a  part  of  this:  where  Alexander %0avanquished  Darius.

But  on  the  other  Side,  where  it  lieth  toward  the %0aCaspian  Sea,  the  Region  Atropatenc,  separated  by  the  River %0aAraxes  from  Oterie  in  Armenia :  its  City,  Gazse,  is  450  Miles %0a%0a1  From  its  resemblance  to  a  part  of  Greece  of  that  name,  with  which %0athey  were  well  acquainted.—  Wern.

The  other  Towns  of  the  Medes %0aare  Phausia,  Agamzua,  and  Apamia,  named  also  Rhaphane. %0aThe  Straits  there,  (called  the  Caspian  Gates,)  have  the  same %0areason  for  being  so  named  as  the  other  (by  Caucasus) ;  be- %0acause the  Mountains  are  broken  through  with  so  narrow %0aa  Passage,  that  hardly  a  single  line  of  Carts  is  able  to  pass %0ait  for  the  Length  of  Eight  Miles  :  and  all  done  by  the  hand %0aof  Man.  The  Cliffs  that  hang  over  on  the  right  Side  and  on %0athe  left  are  as  if  they  were  scorched  :  through  a  silent  Tract %0aof  38  Miles  ;  for  all  the  Moisture  running  together  out  of %0athose  Cliffs,  and  pouring  through  the  Straits,  obstructs  the %0aPassage.  Besides,  the  Multitude  of  Serpents  prevents  Tra- %0avelling except  in  Winter. %0a%0aCHAPTER  XV. %0aNations  about  the  Hircanian  Sea. %0a%0aUNTO  Adiabene  are  joined  the  Carduchi,  so  called  in %0aTimes  past,  and  now  Cordueni ;  along  which  the  Tigris %0arunneth ;  and  on  them  the  Pratitse  border,  called  also  Pare- %0adoni,  who  hold  the  Caspian  Gates.  On  the  other  side  of %0awhom  you  meet  with  the  Deserts  of  Parthia,  and  the  Moun- %0atains of  Cithenus :  and  beyond  these  is  the  most  pleasant %0aTract  of  the  same  Parthia,  called  Choara.  There  stand  two %0aCities  of  the  Parthians,  formerly  opposed  against  the  Me- %0adians :  namely,  Calliope  ;  and  Issatis,  situated  in  times  past %0aupon  another  Rock.  The  Capital  of  Parthia  itself,  lleca- %0atompylos,  is  from  the  (Caspian)  Gates  133  Miles.  Thus  the %0aKingdoms  of  the  Parthians  are  shut  up  by  Doors.  When %0a%0a%0aBOOK  VI.]  History  of  Nature.  115 %0a%0apassed  out  of  these  Gates,  presently  we  enter  on  the  Cas- %0apian Nation,  which  reacheth  as  far  as  the  Sea-shore,  and %0agave  the  Name  to  the  Gates  and  the  Sea.  The  left  hand  is %0afull  of  Mountains :  and  from  this  Nation  backward  to  the %0aRiver  Cyrus,  is  by  report  220  Miles.  From  that  River,  if %0ayou  would  go  higher  up  to  the  Gates,  it  is  700  Miles.  And %0afrom  this  starting-place  began  Alexander  to  reckon  his %0aJourneys :  making  from  those  Gates  to  the  Entrance  of %0aIndia,  15,680  Stadia :  from  thence  to  the  Town  of  Bactra, %0awhich  they  call  Zariaspa,  3700,  and  thence  to  the  River %0aJaxartes  five  Miles. %0a%0aCHAPTER  XVI. %0aOther  Nations  also. %0a%0aFROM  the  Caspian  Country  eastward,  lieth  the  Region %0acalled  Zapanortene,1  and  in  it  Daricum,  a  place  celebrated %0afor  Fertility.  Then  come  the  Nations  of  the  Tapyri,  Anariaci, %0aStauri,  and  Hircani,  at  whose  Coasts  the  same  Sea  beginneth %0ato  take  the  Name  Hircanum,  from  the  River  Syderis.  About %0ait  are  the  Rivers  Mazeras  and  Stratos,  all  issuing  out  of %0aCaucasus.  Then  follows  the  Region  Margiana,  famous  for %0aits  warm  Sunshine,  and  the  only  place  in  all  that  quarter %0awhich  yieldeth  Vines.  It  is  environed  with  pleasant  Moun- %0atains, for  the  compass  of  1500  Stadia:  difficult  of  approach %0aby  reason  of  the  Sandy  Deserts  for  the  space  of  120  Miles; %0aand  it  is  situated  over  against  the  Tract  of  Parthia,  wherein %0aAlexander  had  built  Alexandria ;  which  being  destroyed  by %0athe  Barbarians,  Antiochus  the  Son  ofSeleucus  rebuilt  it  in  the %0asame  place,  upon  the  River  Margus,  which  runneth  through %0ait,  together  with  another  River  Zotale,  and  it  was  called %0aSyriana.2  But  he  desired  rather  that  it  should  be  named %0aAntiochia.

The  principal  People  of  Scythia %0aare  the  Sacse,  Massagetae,  Dahse,  Essedones,  Ariacae,  Rhym- %0anici,  Pesici,  Amordi,  Histi,  Edones,  Camee,  Camacse,  Eu- %0achatse,  Corieri,  Antariani,  Pialae,  Arirnaspi,  formerly  called %0aCacidiri,  Assei,  and  Oetei.  The  Napsei  and  Apellsei  who %0adwelt  there,  are  said  to  have  perished.  The  noble  Rivers  of %0athose  People  are  Mandagrseus  and  Caspasius.  And  surely %0athere  is  not  a  Region  wherein  Geographers  vary  as  they  do %0ain  this :  and  I  believe  this  to  proceed  from  the  very  great %0anumber  of  those  Nations,  and  their  wandering  to  and  fro. %0aAlexander  the  Great  reporteth  that  the  Water  of  the  Scy- %0athian Sea  is  fresh  and  potable ;  and  M.  Varro  saith  that %0aPompey  had  such  Water  brought  to  him  when  he  carried  on %0athe  War  in  that  Neighbourhood  against  Mithridates:  by %0areason,  no  doubt,  of  the  great  Rivers  that  fall  into  it,  which %0aovercome  the  Saltness  of  the  Water.  Varro  saith  also,  that %0aduring  this  Expedition  of  Pompey  to  the  Bactri  it  was  known %0athat  it  is  but  seven  Days'  Journey  from  India  to  the  River %0aIcarus,  which  runneth  into  the  Oxus :  and  that  the  Mer- %0achandise of  India,  transported  by  the  Caspian  Sea,  and  so %0ato  the  River  Cyrus,  may  be  brought  in  not  more  than  five %0aDays  by  Land  as  far  as  to  Phasis  in  Pontus.  Many  Islands %0alie  all  over  that  Sea  :  but  one  above  the  rest  is  Tazata ;  for %0athither  all  the  Shipping  from  the  Caspian  Sea  and  the  Scy- %0athian Ocean  bend  their  Course,  the  Sea-coasts  being  all %0aturned  to  the  East.  The  first  part  of  this  is  uninhabitable, %0afrom  the  Scythian  Promontory,  by  reason  of  the  Snow  :  and %0athe  next  Regions  to  this  are  left  uncultivated  because  of  the %0aFierceness  of  those  Nations  that  border  upon  it.  The  An- %0athropophagi are  in  Scythia,  who  live  on  Man's  flesh.2  This %0ais  the  cause  why  there  are  nothing  there  but  vast  Deserts, %0a%0a1  The  Emodus  or  Imaus  of  Pliny  (a  word  which  in  the  language  of %0athe  inhabitants  signifies  snowy,)  derived  its  origin  immediately  from  the %0aIlimaleh  of  the  Hindoos ;  which  really  signifies  in  their  language  "  snowy," %0aor  more  strictly  speaking,  "the  seat  of  snow." — Quarterly  Review^  vol.  xxiv. %0ap.  103. —  Wern.

It  was  a  pardon- %0aable error  to  suppose  that  silk  was  the  produce  of  a  tree,  instead  of  being %0athe  production  of  a  creature  which  fed  on  it ;  but  it  appears  that  the %0aRomans  were  at  great  pains  in  disentangling  the  woven  texture,  that %0ait  might  again  be  formed  into  garments  which  better  suited  their  taste %0aor  habits.     Martial  speaks  of  this  material  under  the  name  of  Bombycina %0a(Apophoreta,  24),  and  from  his  account  it  was  of  very  fine  texture,  and %0aprobably  expensive.     When  it  was  worn,  the  hair  was  bound  up  into  a %0aknot  and  fastened  with  a  gold  pin,  in  order  that  it  might  not  soil  so %0aexquisite  a  dress.

And  this  part  opposite  the  East,  stretcheth %0astraightforward  to  that  place  where  it  beginneth  to  bend %0atoward  the  Indian  Sea;  and  it  containeth  1875  Miles. %0aThen  that  Tract  which  is  bent  towards  the  South  taketh %0a2475  Miles  (as  Eratosthenes  hath  set  down),  even  to  the %0aRiver  Indus,  which  is  the  utmost  limit  of  India  Westward. %0aBut  many  others  have  set  down  the  whole  Length  of  India %0ain  this  manner ;  that  it  requireth  40  Days  and  Nights'  Sail- %0aing ;  and  also,  that  from  the  North  to  the  South  is  2750 %0aMiles.

And  further %0aDiligence  is  to  be  employed,  considering  they  wrote  of %0aThings  so  various  and  incredible.

And %0athis  they  delivered  with  good  Appearance  of  Reason  :  for  the %0aIndians  were  almost  the  only  Men  of  all  others  that  never %0awent  out  of  their  own  Country.  They  collect  that  from  the %0aTime  of  Father  Liber  to  Alexander  the  Great,  there  reigned %0aover  them  154  Kings,  for  the  Space  of  5402  Years  and  three %0aMonths.  The  Rivers  are  of  wonderful  bigness.  It  is  reported %0athat  Alexander  sailed  every  Day  at  least  600  Stadia  upon  the %0aRiver  Indus,  and  yet  it  took  him  five  Months  and  some  few %0aDays  to  reach  the  end  of  that  River,  although  it  is  allowed  to %0abe  less  than  the  Ganges.  Also,  Seneca,  one  of  ourselves,  who %0alaboured  to  write  Commentaries  on  India,  hath  made  Report %0aof  60  Rivers  therein,  and  of  Nations,  118.

But  above  all  the  Nations  of  India %0athroughout,  and  not  of  this  Tract  only,  the  Prasii  far  exceed %0ain  Power  and  Reputation ;  and  the  largest  and  richest  City, %0aPalibotra,  from  whence  some  have  named  this  Nation,  yea, %0aand  all  the  Country  generally  beyond  Ganges,  Palibotros. %0aTheir  King  keepeth  continually  in  pay  600,000  Footmen, %0a30,000  Horsemen,  and  9000  Elephants,  every  Day.  Whereby %0ayou  may  guess  the  mighty  Wealth  of  this  Prince.  Beyond, %0amore  within,  inhabit  the  Monedes  and  Suari,  who  possess %0athe  Mountain  Maleus  :  in  which,  for  six  Months,  the  Sha- %0adows in  Winter  fall  northward  ;  and  in  Summer,  south- %0a%0a%0a124  History  of  Nature.

Beyond  the  River  Ganges,  in  that  quarter  which  lieth %0asouthward,  the  People  are  coloured  by  the  Sun :  but  though %0atinted,  yet  not  so  burnt  as  the  Ethiopians.  And  the  nearer  they %0aapproach  to  the  Indus,  the  deeper  coloured  they  are  with  the %0aSun :  for  closely  beyond  the  Nation  of  the  Prasii  is  the  In- %0adus :  among  whose  Mountains  the  Pigmrei  are  reported  to %0ainhabit.  Artemidorus  writeth,  that  between  these  two  Rivers %0athere  is  a  Distance  of  21  Miles. %0a%0aCHAPTER  XX. %0aThe  River  Indus. %0a%0aTHE  Indus,  which  the  People  of  that  Country  call  Sandus, %0aissueth  out  of  that  top  of  the  Mountain  Caucasus,  which  is %0acalled  Paropamisus :  it  taketh  its  Course  against  the  Sun- %0arising,  and  receiveth  19  Rivers.  Among  these  the  principal %0aare  Hydaspes,  which  bringeth  with  it  four  more :  and  Can- %0atabra,  conveying  three.  Moreover,  of  such  as  are  of  them- %0aselves navigable,  Acesines  and  Hypasis :  and  yet  so  modest %0ais  the  Course  of  its  Waters,  that  in  no  place  is  it  either  above %0a50  Stadia  over,  or  deeper  than  15  Paces.2  This  River %0aencloseth  a  very  great  Island  named  Prasiane,  and  another %0athat  is  less,  which  they  call  Patale.

From  the  Mouth  of  the  Ganges  to  the  Cape %0aCalingon,  and  the  Town  Dandagula,  are  725  Miles  :  from %0athence  to  Tropina,  1225  Miles.  Then  to  the  Promontory  of %0aPerimula,  where  is  the  chief  Town  of  Merchandise  in  all %0aIndia,  750  Miles:  from  which  to  the  abovesaid  Town  Patale, %0awithin  the  Island,  620  Miles.  The  Mountain  Nations  be- %0atween it  and  Jomanes  are  the  Cesi  and  the  savage  Catreboni : %0anext  to  them  the  Megallae,  whose  King  hath  500  Elephants ; %0aand  of  Foot  and  Horsemen  an  uncertain  number.  The %0aChrysei,  Parasangze,  and  Asangae,  are  full  of  Tigers:  they %0aarm  30,000  Foot,  800  Horsemen,  and  300  Elephants.  The %0aIndus  shuts  them  in,  and  they  are  enclosed  with  a  crown  of %0aMountains  and  Wildernesses  for  (525  Miles.  Beneath  these %0aDeserts  are  the  Dari  and  Surge ;  and  then  again  Deserts  for %0a188  Miles,  compassed  about  for  the  most  part  with  Banks  of %0aSands,  like  Islands  in  the  Sea.  Under  these  Deserts  are  the %0aMaltecorae,  Singae,  Marobae,  Rarungee,  Moruntes,  Masuae, %0aand  Pagungae.  Now  for  those  who  inhabit  the  Mountains, %0awhich  in  a  continual  range  without  interruption  stand  upon %0athe  Coasts  of  the  Ocean,  they  are  free  and  subject  to  no %0aKings,  and  many  Cities  they  hold  among  these  Mountains. %0aThen  come  the  Naraese,  enclosed  within  the  highest  Mountain %0aof  all  the  Indian  Hills,  Capitalia.  On  the  other  side  of  this %0athe  Inhabitants  dig  extensively  in  Gold  and  Silver  Mines. %0aThen  you  enter  upon  Oratura,  whose  King  hath  indeed  but %0a10  Elephants,  but  a  great  abundance  of  Footmen;  and  the %0aVaretatae,  who  under  their  King  keep  no  Elephants,  trusting %0ato  their  Horsemen  and  Footmen.  The  Odomboerae  and %0aSalabastrae ;  the  beautiful  City  Horata,  fortified  with  Fosses %0aand  Marshes  :  through  which  the  Crocodiles,  on  account  of %0atheir  greedy  Appetite  for  Men's  Bodies,  will  suffer  none  to %0apass  into  the  Town,  but  over  the  Bridge.  Another  Town %0athere  is  among  them,  of  great  Name :  Automela,  standing %0aon  the  Sea-side  :  a  noble  resort  of  Merchants,  by  reason  of %0afive  great  Rivers  which  meet  all  there  in  one  confluence. %0aTheir  King  possesseth  1600  Elephants,  150,000  Footmen, %0aand  5000  Horsemen.  The  King  of  the  Charmse  is  poor ;  he %0apossesseth  60  Elephants,  and  his  Power  is  otherwise  small. %0aBeyond  them  are  the  Pandse,  the  only  Nation  of  the  Indians %0a%0a%0a126  History  of  Nature.

Beyond  this  Realm  are  the  Syrieni,  con- %0ataining 300  Cities ;  the  Derangae,  Posingae,  Buzse,  Gogyarei, %0aUmbrae,  Nereae,  Prancosi,  Nobundae,  Cocondae,  Nesei,  Peda- %0atritse,  Solobriasae,  and  Olostrae,  touching  on  the  Island1 %0aPatale :  from  the  utmost  Shore  of  which  Island  unto  the %0aGates  Caspiae,  are  reckoned  18,025  Miles.

Beyond %0athem,  the  Uri  and  Sileni ;  and  then  Deserts  for  250  Miles  ; %0awhich  being  passed  over,  there  are  the  Organages,  the %0aAbaortae,  Sibarae,  and  the  Suertae  :  and  beyond  these  a  Wil- %0aderness as  great  as  the  former.  Again,  the  Sarophages, %0aSorgae,  Baraomatae,  and  the  Gumbritae;  of  whom  there  are %0athirteen  Nations,  and  each  one  hath  two  Cities.  The  Aseni %0ainhabit  three  Cities :  their  capital  City  is  Bucephala,  built  in %0athe  very  Place  where  King  Alexander  s  horse,  called  Buce- %0aphalus, was  buried.  Above  them  are  the  Mountaineers %0abelow  the  Caucacus,  named  Soleadae  and  Sondrae :  and  hav- %0aing passed  the  Indus,  going  along  its  Banks  are  the  Sama- %0arabriae,  the  Sambruceni,  the  Brisabritae,  Osii,  Antixeni,  and %0aTaxillae,  with  a  famous  City  called  Amandra :  from  which  all %0athat  Tract  now  lying  plain  within  the  Country  is  named %0aAmandra.

This  is  that  Mountain  from  which %0aarose  the  Fable,  that  he  sprung  from  the  Seed  of  Jupiter. %0aLikewise  (they  assign  to  India)  the  Country  of  the  Aspagonse, %0aso  plentiful  in  Vines,  Laurels,  and  Box,  and  generally  all %0asorts  of  Fruits  that  grow  in  Greece.  Many  wonderful,  and %0ain  a  manner  fabulous  things,  they  report  of  the  Fertility  of %0athat  Land,  of  the  sorts  of  Fruits,  of  Trees  bearing  Cotton,  of %0aWild  Beasts,  of  Birds,  and  other  Creatures :  which  I  will %0areserve  for  their  proper  places  in  another  part  of  this  Work. %0aThose  four  Satrapies,  which  I  mentioned  before,  I  will  speak %0aof  presently:  for  now  I  hasten  to  the  Island  Taprobane. %0aBut  there  are  other  Isles  first,  as  Patalse,  which  we  have %0anoted  to  lie  in  the  very  Mouth  of  the  River  Indus,  of  a %0aTriangular  figure,  220  Miles  in  Breadth.  Without  the %0aMouth  of  the  Indus,  two  other  Islands,  Chryse  and  Agyre, %0aabounding,  as  I  suppose,  in  Gold  and  Silver  Mines ;  for  I %0acannot  easily  believe,  that  the  Soil  there  is  all  Gold  and %0aSilver,  as  some  have  reported.  Twenty  Miles  from  them  is %0aCrocala:  and  twelve  Miles  further  Bibaga,  abundant  in %0aOysters  and  other  Shell-fishes.  Then,  nine  Miles  beyond %0ait,  Toralliba  sheweth  itself,  and  many  other  petty  Islands. %0a%0aCHAPTER  XXII. %0aThe  Island  Taprobant.1 %0a%0aIT  hath  been  for  a  long  time  thought  that  Taprobane  was %0aanother  World  under  the  appellation  of  the  Antichthones. %0aBut  from  the  time  of  Alexander  the  Great,  and  the  inter- %0acourse in  those  parts,  it  was  discovered  to  be  an  Island. %0aOneslcratusj  the  Admiral  of  his  Fleet,  hath  written,  that  the %0aElephants  bred  in  this  Island  are  bigger  and  better  fitted  for %0aWar  than  those  of  India.

Eratosthenes  also  took  the  Measure %0aof  it,  in  length  7000  Stadia,  and  in  breadth  5000  :  that %0athere  are  no  Cities,  but  Villages  to  the  number  of  700.  It %0abeginneth  at  the  Sea  Eoos,  from  which  it  extendeth %0abetween  the  East  and  West  of  India :  and  in  times %0apast  was  believed  to  lie  out  into  the  Sea  from  the  Prasian %0aNation  twenty  Days'  Sailing.  But  afterwards,  because  the %0aVessels  and  Rigging  used  upon  this  Sea  in  the  Passage %0athither  were  made  of  Paper  Reeds,  like  those  of  the  River %0aNile,  the  Voyage  was  estimated,  by  comparison  with  our %0aShips,  at  about  seven  Days.  All  the  Sea  tying  between %0ais  full  of  Shallows,  no  more  than  five  Fathoms  Deep  ;  but  in %0acertain  Channels  it  is  so  deep  that  no  Anchors  will  reach  the %0aBottom:  and  so  narrow  are  these  Channels,  that  a  Ship %0acannot  turn  within  them ;  and  therefore,  to  avoid  the  neces- %0asity of  turning,  the  Ships  have  Prows  at  both  ends.  In %0aSailing,  there  is  no  Observation  of  the  Stars.  The  North %0aPole  is  never  seen  :  but  they  carry  with  them  Birds,  which %0athey  send  off  at  intervals  and  follow  their  Course,  as  they %0afly  to  Land :  neither  used  they  go  to  Sea  for  more  than %0athree  Months  in  the  Year  ;  and  for  one  hundred  Days  from %0athe  Solstice  they  take  most  heed ;  for  at  that  time  it  is  Win- %0ater with  them.  And  thus  much  we  know  by  relation  of %0aancient  Writers.  But  we  obtain  better  Intelligence,  and %0amore  accurate  Information,  by  Ambassadors  who  came  out %0aof  that  Island,  in  the  reign  of  Claudius,  which  happened %0aafter  this  manner.  A  Freed-man  of  Annius  Plocamus,  who %0ahad  Farmed  from  the  Exchequer  the  Customs  of  the  Red %0aSea,  as  he  sailed  about  the  Coasts  of  Arabia,  was  driven  with %0athe  North  Winds  beyond  the  Realm  of  Carmania,  and  in  the %0aSpace  of  15  Days  he  reached  an  Harbour  of  that  Country, %0acalled  Hippuros.  He  found  the  King  of  that  Country  so %0acourteous,  as  to  afford  him  Entertainment  for  six  Months. %0aAnd  as  he  used  to  discourse  with  him  about  the  Romans  and %0aCaesar,  he  recounted  to  him  at  large  of  all  things.  But %0aamong  many  other  Reports  that  he  heard,  he  wondered  most %0aat  their  Justice,  because  their  Denarii  of  the  Money  which %0a%0a%0aBOOK  V  [ .]  History  of  Nature.  ]  29 %0a%0awas  taken  were  always  of  the  same  Weight,  although  the %0adifferent  Images  shewed  that  they  were  made  by  different %0aPersons.  And  hereupon  especially  was  he  moved  to  seek %0afor  the  Friendship  of  Rome  ;  and  so  despatched  four  Ambas- %0asadors, of  whom  Rachias  was  the  chief.  From  them  it  be- %0acame known  that  there  were  five  hundred  Towns  in  it ;  and %0athat  there  was  a  Harbour  facing  the  South,  lying  conve- %0aniently near  the  Town  Palesimundum,  the  principal  City  of %0aall  that  Realm,  and  the  King's  Seat ;  that  there  were %0a200,000  common  Citizens  :  that  within  this  Island  there  was %0aa  Lake  called  Magisba,  270  Miles  in  Circuit,  containing  in %0ait  some  Islands  fruitful  in  nothing  but  Pasturage.  Out  of %0athis  Lake  issued  two  Rivers ;  the  one,  Palesimundas,  pass- %0aing near  to  the  City  of  the  same  Name,  and  running  into  the %0aHarbour  with  three  Streams ;  of  which  the  Narrowest  was  five %0aStadia  Broad,  and  the  largest  fifteen  ;  the  other  Northward %0atowards  India,  by  Name  Cydara :  also  that  the  next  Cape  of %0athis  Country  to  India  is  called  Colaicum,  from  which  to  the %0anearest  Port  (of  India)  is  counted  four  Days'  Sailing  :  in  the %0amidst  of  which  Passage,  there  lieth  the  Island  of  the  Sun. %0aThey  said,  moreover,  that  the  Water  of  this  Sea  was  of  a %0adeep  green  Colour;  and,  what  is  still  more  extraordinary, %0afull  of  Trees  growing  within  it  :1  so  that  the  Pilots  with %0atheir  Helms  broke  off  the"  Crests  of  those  Trees.  They  won- %0adered to  see  the  Stars  about  the  North  Pole  (Septentriones) %0aand  Vergiliae,  as  if  it  had  been  a  new  Heaven.  They  confessed %0aalso  they  never  saw,  with  them,  the  Moon  above  the  Earth %0abefore  it  was  eight  Days  old,2  nor  after  the  sixteenth  Day. %0aThat  the  Canopus,  a  great  and  bright  Star,  used  to  shine  all %0aNight  with  them.  But  the  thing  that  they  were  most  sur- %0aprised at  was,  that  they  observed  the  Shadow  of  their  own %0a%0a1  Branched  corals,  beyond  a  doubt. —  Wern.

But  even  this  Island  Taprobane, %0aseeming,  as  it  were,  to  be  separated  by  Nature  from  all  the %0aWorld,  is  not  without  the  Vices  with  which  we  are  tainted. %0aFor  Gold  and  Silver  are  even  there  also  highly  esteemed : %0aand  Marble,  especially  if  it  be  fashioned  like  a  Tortoise-shell. %0aGems  and  Pearls  also,  of  the  better  sort,  are  in  great  honour : %0aand  the  Abundance  of  our  Luxury.  These  Ambassadors  said %0athat  their  Riches  were  greater,  but  that  we  had  more  use  of %0athem.  They  affirmed,  that  no  Man  with  them  had  any %0aSlaves  ;  neither  slept  they  after  Day-light,  nor  in  the  Day- %0atime :  that  the  Manner  of  Building  their  Houses  is  low,  that %0athe  Price  of  Victuals  did  not  fluctuate ;  and  there  were  no %0aCourts,  or  going  to  Law.

The  Age  ensuing  dis- %0acovered a  shorter  and  safer  Course  ;  namely,  if  from  the  said %0aPromontory  they  set  their  Course  directly  to  the  River  Zize- %0arus,  an  Harbour  in  India.  And  in  truth  this  Passage  was %0asailed  for  a  long  time,  until  at  length  a  Merchant  found  out %0aa  more  compendious  Course,  and  India  was  brought  near %0afor  Gain :  for  every  Year  they  sailed  thither,  and  because %0aPirates  very  much  infest  them,  they  embark  in  their  Ships %0aCompanies  of  Archers.

It  is  worthy  to  be  observed,  that  there %0ais  not  a  Year  but  it  costs  our  State  to  furnish  into  India, %0a500,000  Sesterces,  (fifty  millions  of  Sesterces.)  For  which %0athe  Indians  send  back  Merchandise,  which  at  Rome  is %0asold  for  a  hundred  times  as  much  as  it  cost.  From  Alex- %0aandria it  is  two  Miles  to  Juliopolis  :  from  whence  on  the %0aNilus  they  sail  303  Miles  to  Coptus,  which  may  be  done  in %0atwelve  Days,  with  the  Etesian  Winds  blowing.

And  then  to  Hydreuma  the  New,  from  Coptus,  234 %0aMiles.1  There  is  another  called  Hydreuma  the  Old,  named %0aalso  Troglodyticum,  where,  two  Miles  out  of  the  direct  way,  is %0aa  Garrison,  four  Miles  distant  from  New  Hydreuma.

But  for  them  that  would  make  a %0aJourney  to  the  Indians,  the  most  commodious  place  from %0awhence  to  set  forward  is  Ocelis :  for  from  thence,  and  with %0athe  West  Wind  called  Hypalus,  they  have  a  passage  of  forty %0aDays'  Sailing  to  the  first  Town  of  Merchandise  in  India, %0acalled  Muziris.  However,  this  Port  is  not  to  be  ventured %0ain,  because  of  the  neighbouring  Pirates,  which  keep  ordi- %0anarily about  a  place  called  Hydrae;  and  it  is  not  richly %0astored  with  Merchandise.  And  moreover,  the  Station  of  the %0aShips  is  far  from  the  Land,  so  that  they  must  convey  their %0aWares  in  little  Boats  which  they  use  for  the  purpose.

The  Region  from  whence %0athey  transport  Pepper  in  small  Lighters  made  of  one  piece %0aof  Wood  to  Becare,  is  named  Cotona  :  of  all  which  Nations, %0aPorts,  and  Towns,  there  is  not  a  Name  found  in  any  of  the %0aformer  Writers.

When  they %0asail  from  India  they  have  the  (North-East)  Wind,  Vulturnus, %0awith  them :  and  when  they  have  entered  into  the  Red  Sea, %0athe  South  or  South-west.  Now  will  we  return  to  our  pro- %0aposed Discourse  concerning  Carmania :  the  Coast  of  which, %0aafter  the  reckoning  of  Nearchus,  may  take  in  Circuit  12,050 %0aMiles.  From  its  Beginning  to  the  River  Sabis  is  100  Miles; %0afrom  whence  as  far  as  to  the  River  Andanin,  are  Vineyards %0aand  Corn-fields,  well  cultivated.  The  Region  is  called  Ar- %0amuzia.  The  Towns  of  Carmania  are  Zetis  and  Alexandria. %0aIn  this  part  the  Sea  breaketh  into  the  Land  in  two  Arms ; %0awhich  our  Countrymen  call  the  Red  Sea,1  and  the  Greeks %0aErythrseum,  from  a  King  named  Erythras:  or  (as  some %0athink)  because  the  Sea,  by  reason  of  the  Reflexion  of  the  Sun, %0aseemeth  of  a  reddish  colour.  Others  suppose  that  this  Redness %0ais  occasioned  of  the  Sand  and  Ground,  which  is  Red:  and  others %0aagain,  that  the  very  Water  is  of  its  own  nature  so  coloured. %0a%0aCHAPTER  XXIV. %0aThe  Persian  and  Arabian  Gulfs. %0a%0aTHIS  Red  Sea  is  divided  into  Two  Gulfs,     That  from  the %0aEast  is  named  the  Persian  Gulf,  and  is  in  Circuit  2500  Miles, %0a%0a1  Another  reason  for  the  name  is  to  be  found  in  Esau,  the  son  of  the %0apatriarch  Isaac,  and  whose  dominion  was  on  its  borders.  Bruce  and  others %0ahave  advanced  opinions  with  regard  to  the  origin  of  the  name  of  this  cele- %0abrated sea ;  but  its  most  ancient  name  may  be  rendered  the  Weedy  Sea. %0a-  Wern.

On  the  other %0aside  there  is  another  called  the  Arabian  Gulf,  which  runneth %0ainto  the  Ocean,  called  Azanius.  The  Mouth  of  the  Persian %0aGulf  is  Five  Miles  wide,  though  some  have  made  it  but %0aFour.

Of  these  Eleven, %0awhich  are  called  the  Higher  Provinces,  take  their  beginning %0afrom  the  Border  of  Armenia,  and  the  Coasts  of  the  Caspian  ; %0aand  they  reach  to  the  Scythians,  with  whom  they  have  equal %0aIntercourse  on  the  other  side.  The  other  Seven  are  called %0athe  Lower  Provinces.  As  for  the  Parthians,  their  Land %0aalways  lay  at  the  Foot  of  those  Mountains  of  which  we  have %0aso  often  spoken,  which  enclose  all  those  Nations.  It  hath %0aon  the  East  the  Arii,  and  southward  Carmania  and  the %0aAriani ;  on  the  west  side  the  Pratitse  and  Medi ;  and  on %0athe  North  the  Hircani ;  and  is  compassed  about  with  Deserts. %0aThe  farthest  Nations  of  the  Parthians  are  called  Nomades : %0abeyond  the  Deserts  their  Cities  toward  the  West,  are  Issaris %0aand  Calliope,  of  which  we  have  written  before  ;  but  toward %0athe  North-east,  Europum ;  and  South-east,  Mania.

For  Media  on  the %0aWest  runneth  obliquely,  confronteth  the  Parthise,  and  en- %0acloseth  both  these  Realms.  Therefore  on  the  East  side  it %0ahath  the  Parthians  and  Caspians :  on  the  South,  Sittacene, %0aSusiane,  and  Persis  ;  Westward,  Adiabene ;  and  Northward, %0aArmenia.  The  Persians  always  dwelt  about  the  Red  Sea,  on %0awhich  account  it  was  called  the  Persian  Gulf.  The  Mari- %0atime Coast  thereabout  is  called  Cyropolis,  and  that  part %0awhich  bordereth  upon  the  Medes  Elymais.

All  Mesopotamia  belonged  to  the  Assyrians,  dis- %0apersed in  Villages,  except  Babylon  and  Ninus.  The  Mace- %0adonians collected  it  into  Cities  on  account  of  the  goodness  of %0atheir  Soil.  Besides  the  above-named  Towns,  it  hath  Seleucia, %0aLaodicea,  and  Artemita  :  likewise  within  the  Nation  of  the %0aArabians  named  Aroei  and  Mardani,  Antiochia :  and  that %0awhich,  being  founded  by  Nicanor,  Governor  of  Mesopotamia, %0ais  called  Arabis.

But  there  continue  still  as  they %0awere,  Hebata  and  Oruros,  unto  which,  by  the  Conduct  of %0aPompey  the  Great,  the  Bounds  of  the  Roman  Empire  were %0aextended ;  and  it  is  from  Zeugma  250  Miles.  Some  Writers %0asay  that  the  Euphrates  was  divided  by  a  Governor  of  Meso- %0apotamia, and  one  Arm  of  it  brought  to  Gobaris  ;  which  was %0adone  lest  the  River  should  endanger  the  City  of  Babylon. %0aThey  affirm,  moreover,  that  the  Assyrians  generally  called  it %0aArmalchar,1  which  signifieth  a  Royal  River.  On  the  Place %0awhere  it  is  turned  there  stood  Agrani,  one  of  the  greatest %0aTowns  of  that  Region,  which  the  Persians  utterly  destroyed. %0aBabylon,2  the  Capital  of  the  Chaldean  Nations,  for  a  long- %0atime possessed  an  illustrious  Name  through  all  the  World  :  in %0aregard  of  which  the  other  Part  of  Mesopotamia  and  Assyria %0awas  named  Babylonia  :  and  embracing  60  Miles.  The  Walls %0awere  200  Feet  in  Height,  and  50  broad  :  reckoning  to  every %0aFoot  three  Fingers'  Breadth  more  than  our  ordinary  Mea- %0asure. Through  the  midst  passeth  the  River  Euphrates :  with %0aa  wonderful  Work,  on  both  Sides.

But  contrary  to  the  report  by  which  Pliny  professes  to  be %0aguided,  this  ancient  Greek  author  represents  them  to  have  been  built  in %0athe  form  of  a  square ;  and  although  the  lapse  of  time  may  have  caused  a %0avariety  of  changes  to  take  place  in  other  particulars  regarding  this  city, %0awe  can  scarcely  suppose  that  these  changes  can  have  extended  to  the %0adimensions  or  situation  of  its  stupendous  walls ;  by  which  alone  its  form %0awould  be  influenced.     It  is  surprising  that  among  the  authors  which %0aPliny  had  consulted  in  drawing  up  his  account  of  these  regions,  he  makes %0ano  mention  of  this  illustrious  Greek  writer,  though  he  quotes  him  in %0aother  places.     Philostratus,  Solinus,  Diodorus,    Quintus  Curtius,  and %0amore  especially  the  Bible,  may  be  consulted  for  a  variety  of  curious  par- %0aticulars regarding  this  eminent  and   powerful  city,  whose  walls  and %0asplendour  are  now  buried  in  a  desert. —  Wern.

Nevertheless  it  is %0areduced  to  a  Desert,  having  been  exhausted  by  Seleucia, %0awhich  standeth  near  it :  and  which  was  for  that  very  purpose %0abuilt  by  Nicator  within  the  Fortieth  Stone,  at  the  Place  of %0ameeting  of  the  New  Channel  of  Euphrates  with  the  Tigris : %0anevertheless  it  is  named  Babylonia,  a  free  State  at  this  Day, %0aof  independent  Jurisdiction;  but  they  live  after  the  Man- %0aners of  the  Macedonians.  And  by  report  there  are  600,000 %0acommon  Citizens.  The  Position  of  the  Walls,  by  report,  is %0ain  the  form  of  an  Eagle  spreading  out  her  Wings  :  and  the %0aSoil  is  the  most  Fertile  in  all  the  East.  The  Parthians, %0aagain,  to  exhaust  this  City,  built  Ctesiphon  within  the  Third %0aStone  from  it,  in  Chalonitis ;  which  now  is  the  Head %0aof  the  Kingdom.  But  when  it  advanced  nothing,  King %0aVologesus  founded  another  Town  near  it,  called  Vologeso %0aCerta.  There  are  also  in  Mesopotamia  the  Cities  Hyp- %0aparenum,  a  City  likewise  of  the  Chaldaeans,  and  ennobled %0afor  Learning,  and,  as  well  as  Babylon,  situated  near  the %0aRiver  Narraga,  which  gave  the  Name  to  the  City.  The %0aPersians  destroyed  the  Walls  of  this  Hypparenum.  There  are %0aalso  in  this  Tract  the  Orcheni,  toward  the  south  ;  and  a  Third %0aSect  of  the  Chaldaeans.  Beyond  this  Region  are  the  Notitae, %0aOrthophantae,  and  Graeciochantae.  Nearchus  and  Onesi- %0acritus  report,  That  from  the  Persian  Sea  to  Babylon,  by  the %0aVoyage  up  the  Euphrates,  is  412  Miles.  But  later  Writers %0acount  from  Seleucia  490  Miles.  Juba  writeth,  that  from %0aBabylon  to  Charax  is  175  Miles.  Some  affirm  that  beyond %0aBabylon  the  River  Euphrates  floweth  in  one  Channel  87 %0aMiles,  before  it  is  divided  to  water  the  Country  :  its  entire %0aCourse  being  1200  Miles.  This  variety  in  Authors  is  the  cause %0aof  the  Uncertainty  of  the  Measure,  considering  that  even  the %0avery  Persians  agree  not  about  the  Dimensions  of  their %0aSchceni  and  Parasangae,  but  have  different  Measures  of  them. %0aWhere  the  River  Euphrates  ceaseth  to  defend  by  its  own %0aChannel,  at  the  portion  approaching  the  Border  of  Charax, %0athere  is  great  danger  of  the  Robbers  called  Attalae,  a  Nation %0aof  the  Arabians.

This  is  the  Breadth  there  of  the  Land  between %0athe  two  Seas.  The  Kingdoms  of  Parthia  contain  944  Miles. %0aFinally,  there  is  a  Town  of  Mesopotamia  on  the  Bank  of  the %0aTigris,  near  where  the  Rivers  meet,  which  they  call  Digba. %0a%0aCHAPTER  XXVII. %0aThe  River  Tigris. %0a%0aIT  is  also  convenient  to  say  somewhat  of  the  River  Tigris %0aitself.  It  beginneth  in  the  Region  of  Armenia  the  Greater, %0aissuing  out  of  a  great  Source  in  the  Plain.  The  place  beareth %0athe  Name  of  Elongosine.  The  River  itself,  so  long  as  it  run- %0aneth slowly,  is  named  Diglito ;  but  when  it  beginneth  to  be %0arapid,  it  is  called  Tigris,  which  in  the  Median  language  sig- %0anifieth  a  Dart.  It  runneth  into  the  Lake  Arethusa,  which %0abeareth  up  all  that  is  cast  into  it;  and  the  Vapours  that  arise %0aout  of  it  carry  Clouds  of  Nitre.  In  this  Lake  there  is  but %0aone  kind  of  Fish,  and  that  entereth  not  into  the  Channel  of %0athe  Tigris  as  it  passeth  through ;  as  likewise  the  Fishes  of %0athe  Tigris  do  not  swim  out  into  the  Water  of  the  Lake.  In %0aits  Course  and  Colour  it  is  unlike  the  other :  and  when  it  is %0apast  the  Lake  and  meeteth  the  Mountain  Taurus,  it  loseth %0aitself  in  a  Cave,  and  so  runneth  under,  until  on  the  other %0a%0a%0a1  This  is  Tadmor  in  the  wilderness,  built  by  Solomon,  king  of  Israel, %0aand  further  illustrious  from  being  the  city  where  the  critic  Longinus  was %0athe  prime  minister  of  the  Queen  Zenobia.  It  is  now  truly  in  a  wilder- %0aness, but  is  still  celebrated  for  its  remains  of  antiquity :  chiefly  of  Greek %0aconstruction.  There  are  many  streams  coming  down  from  the  adjacent %0amountains,  and  there  can  be  no  doubt  that  if  a  settled  tribe  fixed %0athemselves  there,  the  tract  would  become  as  fine  an  oasis  as  erer. — %0aWern.

That  it  is  the  same  River  is  evident  by  this,  that  it %0acarrieth  through  whatever  was  cast  into  it.  After  this  second %0aSpring,  it  runneth  through  another  Lake,  named  Thospites, %0aand  again  taketh  its  Way  under  the  Earth  through  Gutters, %0aand  25  Miles  beyond  it  is  returned  about  Nymphaeum. %0aClaudius  Caesar  reporteth,  that  in  the  Country  Arrhene,  it %0arunneth  so  near  to  the  River  Arsanias,  that  when  they  both %0aswell  they  join,  but  without  mingling  their  Water;  for  Arsa- %0anias, being  the  lighter,  floateth  over  the  other,  for  almost  the %0aSpace  of  four  Miles ;  but  soon  after  they  part  asunder,  and  it %0aturneth  its  Course  toward  the  River  Euphrates,  into  which %0ait  entereth.  But  Tigris  receiving  the  famous  Rivers  out  of %0aArmenia  :  Parthenis,  Agnice,  and  Pharion,  so  dividing  the %0aArabians,  Aroeans,  and  the  Adiabeni,  and  by  this  means %0amaking,  as  we  have  said,  Mesopotamia  to  be  an  Island,  after %0ait  hath  passed  by  and  viewed  the  Mountains  of  the  Gordiaei, %0anear  Apamia,  a  Town  of  Mesene  on  this  side  Seleucia,  sur- %0anamed  Babylonia,  125  Miles.  Dividing  itself  into  two  Chan- %0anels, with  the  one  it  runneth  southward  to  Seleucia,  watering %0athe  Country  of  Mesene  ;  and  with  the  other  it  windeth  to %0athe  north,  on  the  back  of  the  said  Mesene,  and  cutteth %0athrough  the  Plains  of  the  Cauchians.  When  these  two %0aBranches  are  united  again,  it  is  called  Pasitigris.  After  this %0ait  receiveth  out  of  Media  the  Coaspes  ;  and  so  passing  be- %0atween Seleucia  and  Ctesiphon,  as  we  have  said,  it  poureth %0aitself  into  the  Lakes  of  Chaldsea,  which  it  replenisheth  with %0aWater  for  the  Compass  of  threescore  and  ten  Miles  :  which %0adone,  it  issueth  forth,  gushing  out  with  a  very  great  Stream, %0aand  on  the  right  of  the  Town  Charax  is  discharged  into  the %0aPersian  Sea,  by  a  Mouth  ten  Miles  over.  Between  the %0aMouths  of  these  two  Rivers  were  25  Miles,  or,  as  some  say, %0aseven  :  and  both  of  them  were  navigable.  But  the  Orcheni %0aand  other  neighbouring  Inhabitants  long  since  turned  the %0aCourse  of  Euphrates  aside  to  water  their  Fields,  insomuch %0athat  it  is  conveyed  into  the  Sea,  only  through  the  Tigris. %0aThe  next  Country  bordering  upon  the  Tigris  is  called  Para- %0apotamia  :  in  it  is  Mesene,  of  which  we  have  spoken.

Chalonitis  is  joined  with  Ctesiphon,  noble %0anot  only  with  Date-trees,  but  also  with  Olive,  Apple,  and %0aPear-trees,  and  generally  with  all  sorts  of  Fruit.  Unto  this %0aCountry  extendeth  the  Mountain  Zagrus,  coming  out  of  Ar- %0amenia, between  the  Medes  and  Adiabeni,  above  Paraetacene %0aand  Persis.  Chalonitis  is  distant  from  Persis  480  Miles. %0aSome  write,  that  by  the  nearest  Way  it  is  so  much  from  the %0aCaspian  Sea  to  Assyria.  Between  these  Nations  and  Mesene %0alieth  Sittacene,  the  same  that  is  called  Arbelitis  and  Pales- %0atine. The  Towns  therein  are  Sittace  of  the  Graecians,  toward %0athe  east,  and  Sabata ;  but  on  the  West,  Antiochia,  between %0atwo  Rivers,  Tigris  and  Tornadotus.  Also  Apamia,  which %0aAntiochus  so  called  after  his  Mother's  Name.  This  City %0ais  environed  with  the  River  Tigris,  and  divided  by  the  River %0aArchous.  Somewhat  lower  is  Susiane,  wherein  (is)  Susa, %0athe  ancient  Region  of  the  Persians,  founded  by  Darius,  the %0aSon  of  Hystaspes ;  and  from  Seleucia  Babylonia,  it  is  distant %0a450  Miles ;  and  as  much  from  Ecbatana  of  the  Medes, %0athrough  the  Mountain  Charbanus.  Upon  that  Channel  of %0athe  Tigris  which  taketh  its  Course  northward,  standeth  the %0aTown  Babytace  :  and  from  Susa  it  is  135  Miles.  The  People %0aof  this  Country  are  the  only  Men  in  the  World  that  hate %0aGold :  and  they  bury  it,  that  it  may  serve  for  no  use  to  any %0aone.  To  the  Susiani  eastward  are  joined  the  Cossiaei  Rob- %0abers, and  forty  Nations  of  the  Mizsei,  free  and  wild.  Above %0athese  lie  the  Parthusi,  Mardi,  Saitae,  and  Hyi,  who  are %0aspread  abroad  above  Elemais,  which  joineth  to  the  maritime %0aCoasts  of  Persis,  as  is  above  said.  Susa  is  from  the  Persian %0aSea  250  Miles.  On  that  Side  where  the  Fleet  of  Alexander %0acame  up  the  Pasitigris,  there  standeth  a  Village  upon  the %0aLake  Chaldais,  named  Aphle :  from  which  to  Susa  is  65| %0aMiles  by  Water.  The  next  that  border  upon  the  Susiani %0aeastward  are  the  Cossaei  ;  and  above  the  Cossaei  northward %0alieth  Mesobatene,  under  the  Mountain  Cambiladus,  which  is %0aa  Branch  of  the  Caucasus :  and  from  thence  is  the  most  easy %0aPassage  to  the  Bactri.  The  River  Eulaeus  maketh  a  Parti- %0ation between  Elimais  and  Susiane.  This  River  riseth  in  the %0aCountry  of  the  Medi,  and  in  the  midst  of  its  Course  loseth %0a%0a%0aBOOK  VI.]  History  of  Nature.  145 %0a%0aitself  in  the  Ground  ;  but  rising  again,  and  running  through %0aMesobatene,  it  passeth  round  the  Castle  of  the  Susi  and  the %0aTemple   of  Diana,  the  most  august  Temple  among  those %0aNations  :   and   the  very  River  itself  is   ceremoniously  re- %0agarded :  so  that  the  Kings  drink  of  no  other,  and  therefore %0athey  carry  it  to  a  great  distance.     It  receiveth  the  River %0aHedypnus,  which  corneth  along  by  the  Asylum  of  the  Per- %0asians, and  one  from  among  the  Susiani.    A  Town  there  is  near %0ait,  called  Magoa,  15  Miles  from  Charax.  Some  place  this  Town %0ain  the  utmost  Borders  of  Susiana,  close  to  the  Deserts.     Be- %0aneath Eulaeus  lieth  Elymais,  joining  to  Persis  on  the  Sea- %0acoast  ;  it  is  240  Miles  from  the  River  Oroates  to  Charax.  The %0aTowns  in  it  are  Seleucia  and  Sositare,  situated  upon  the %0aMountain  Casyrus.     The  Coast  which  lieth  before  it  is,  as %0awe  have  said  before,  no  less  dangerous  than  the  Lesser  Syrtes, %0abecause  of  the  Mud  and  Slime  which  the  Rivers  Brixia  and %0aOrtacea  bring  down;  and  Elimais  itself  is  so    moist   that %0athere  is  no  Way  to  Persis  but  by  taking  a  Circuit  about %0ait.     It  is  also  much  infested  with  Serpents,  which   those %0aRivers  bring  down :  but  that  part  of  it  is  the  least  passable %0awhich  they  call  Characene,  from  the  Town  (Charax),  which %0alimiteth  the  Kingdoms  of  Arabia  :  of  which  we  will  speak %0aby  and  by,  after  we  have  set  down  the  Opinion  ofM.Agrippa; %0afor  he  hath  written,  that  Media,  Parthia,  and  Persis,  are %0abounded  on  the  East  by  the  Indus ;  on  the  West,  by  the %0aTigris  ;  on  the  North,  by  the  Taurus  and  Caucasus ;  and  on %0athe  South,  by  the  Red  Sea :  also,  that  they  extend  in  Length %0a1320  Miles,  and  in  Breadth  840.     Moreover,  that  Mesopo- %0atamia by  itself  is  enclosed  eastward  by  the  Tigris,  westward  by %0athe  Euphrates ;  on  the  North  by  the  Taurus,  and  on  the  South %0aby  the  Persian  Sea;  being  in  Length  800  Miles,  and  in %0aBreadth  360.     Charax  is  the  inmost  Town  of  the  Persian %0aGulf,  from  which  Arabia,  called  Eudaemon  (happy)  runneth %0aforth  in  Length;  it  is  situated  upon  a  Mount  artificially %0araised  between  the  Confluence  of  Tigris  on  the  right  Hand, %0aand  Eulseus  on  the  left :  with  an  Expansion  of  three  Miles. %0aIt  was  first  founded  by  Alexander  the  Great ;  who,  having %0adrawn  Colonists  out  of  the  royal  City  Durine  (which  then %0a%0aVOL.  II.  L %0a%0a%0a146  History  of  Nature.  [BOOK  VI. %0a%0awas  ruined),  and  leaving  there  behind  him  those  Soldiers %0awhich  were  not  fit  for  service,  ordained  that  this  Town  should %0abe  called  Alexandria ;  and  the  District  about  it,  Pellseum, %0afrom  his  native  Country  :  and  he  peopled  it  only  with  Mace- %0adonians. This  Town  was  destroyed  by  the  Rivers.  After- %0awards, Antiochus,  the  fifth  of  the  Kings,  rebuilt  it,  and %0anamed  it  from  himself.  But  when  it  was  injured  again, %0aSpasines,  Son  of  Sogdonacus,  King  of  the  adjoining  Arabians, %0aand  not  (as  Juba  reporteth)  a  Lord  (Satrap)  under  Antiochus, %0arestored  it  by  Moles  opposite  each  other,  and  called  it  after %0ahis  own  Name.  He  thus  fortified  the  Site  of  it  three  Miles  in %0aLength  and  little  less  in  Breadth.  At  the  beginning  it  stood %0aupon  the  Sea-coast,  being  from  the  Water-side  ten  Stadia ; %0aand  even  from  thence  it  hath  false  Galleries :  but  by  the %0aReport  of  Juba,  in  his  Time,  50  Miles.  At  this  Day  the %0aArabian  Ambassadors,  and  also  our  Merchants  that  come  from %0athence,  affirm  it  is  from  the  Sea-shore  125  Miles :  so  that  it %0acannot  be  found  in  any  Place  that  the  Earth  hath  gained %0amore,  or  in  so  short  a  Time  by  means  of  the  Mud  brought %0adown  by  Rivers.  And  it  is  the  more  wonderful,  that  the %0aTide  which  riseth  far  beyond  this  Town  doth  not  carry  it %0aaway  again.  In  this  very  Town  I  am  not  ignorant  that %0aDionysius,  the  latest  of  our  modern  Geographers,  was  born  : %0awhom  Divus  Augustus  sent  before  into  the  East  to  write  a %0aDescription  of  whatever  he  found,  for  the  Information  of  his %0aelder  Son,  who  was  about  to  proceed  into  Armenia,  in  an %0aExpedition  against  the  Parthians  and  Arabians.  It  has  not %0aescaped  me,  nor  is  it  forgotten,  that  in  my  first  Entrance  into %0athis  Work,  I  professed  to  follow  those  who  had  written  of %0atheir  own  Countries,  as  being  the  most  diligent  in  that  be- %0ahalf.

The  Peninsula  itself  of  Arabia  runneth %0aout  between  two  Seas,  the  Red  and  the  Persian,  by  a %0acertain  Workmanship  of  Nature,  resembling  Italy  in  Form %0aand  Magnitude,  with  its  Sea-coasts  also  in  the  manner  of %0aItaly.  It  also  regardeth  the  same  Quarter  of  the  Heaven %0awithout  any  Difference.  This  Tract,  for  the  rich  Seat  it %0ahath,  is  named  Felix  (happy).

The  Nomades,  and %0athose  Robbers  that  trouble  the  Chaldseans,  the  People %0acalled  Scenitse,  border  on  it  as  we  have  before  said ;  they  also %0aare  Wanderers,  but  are  so  called  from  their  Tabernacles, %0awhich  they  make  of  Hair-cloths,  and  they  encamp  under %0athem  as  they  please.  Being  past  them  you  find  the  Nabatsei, %0awho  inhabit  a  Town  named  Petra,  in  the  Valley,  little  less %0athan  two  Miles  large ;  environed  with  very  steep  Mountains, %0aand  having  a  River  running  through  the  midst  of  it.  It %0ais  distant  from  Gaza  (a  Town  of  our  Coast)  600  Miles ;  and %0afrom  the  Persian  Gulf,  122.  And  here  meet  both  the  High- %0aways, that  is,  the  one  which  Passengers  travel  to  Palmyra  in %0aSyria,  and  the  other  wherein  they  come  from  Gaza.  Beyond %0aPetra  the  Omani  inhabit  as  far  as  to  Carax,  in  the  celebrated %0aTowns  built  by  Semiramis,  namely,  Abesamis  and  Soractia. %0aBut  now  all  is  a  Wilderness,  Then  come  you  to  a  Town %0a%0a%0a148  History  of  Nature.  [BooK  VI. %0a%0anamed  Forath,  situated  upon  the  Bank  of  the  Pasitigris,  and %0asubject  to  the  King  of  the  Caraceni :  to  which  they  resort %0afrom  Petra;  and  from  thence  to  Charax  they  sail  with  a %0afavourable  Tide  for  the  Space  of  twelve  Miles.  But  they %0athat  come  by  Water  out  of  the  Parthian  Kingdom,  meet  with %0aa  Village  called  Teredon,  below  the  Place  where  Euphrates %0aand  Tigris  meet.  The  Chaldaeans  inhabit  the  left  Bank  of %0athe  River,  and  the  Nomades  called  Scenitse,  the  right.  Some %0aaffirm,  that  as  you  sail  on  the  Tigris,  you  pass  by  two  other %0aTowns,  distant  from  each  other :  the  one  called  formerly %0aBarbatia,  and  afterwards  Thumata,  which  our  Merchants %0areport  to  be  ten  Days'  Sail  from  Petra,  and  to  be  subject  to %0athe  King  of  the  Characeni :  and  the  other  named  Apamia, %0asituated  in  the  Place  where  the  Overflowing  of  Euphrates %0ajoineth  with  the  Tigris ;  and  therefore  they  prevent  the  In- %0avasion of  the  Parthians,  by  breaking  up  the  Banks  and  so %0aprocure  an  Inundation  of  the  Waters.  Now  being  past  Cha- %0arax, we  will  discourse  of  the  Coast  first  explored  by  Epi- %0aphanes.  The  Place  where  the  Mouth  of  the  Euphrates  was. %0aA  River  of  Salt  Water  ;  the  Promontory  Chaldone,  where  the %0aSea  is  more  like  a  Whirlpool  than  a  Sea,  for  50  Miles.  The %0aRiver  Achana  ;  Deserts  for  100  Miles,  until  you  come  to  the %0aIsland  Ichara  :  the  Bay  Capeus,  which  the  Gaulopes  and %0aChateni  inhabit :  the  Bay  Gerraicus,  and  the  Town  Gerra, %0afive  Miles  in  extent ;  and  fortified  with  Towers  made  of  square %0aMasses  of  Salt.  Fifty  Miles  from  the  Sea-side  is  the  Region %0aAttene :  and  overagainst  it  the  Island  Tylos,  as  many  Miles %0afrom  the  Shore,  with  a  Town  bearing  the  Name  of  the  Island, %0amuch  celebrated  for  Abundance  of  Pearls  :  and  not  far  from %0ait  is  another  somewhat  less,  twelve  Miles  from  the  Cape  of %0athe  aforesaid  Tylos.  Beyond  these  there  are  discovered  by %0aReport  some  great  Islands ;  but  they  have  not  been  visited %0aby  our  Merchants.  This  last  Island  is  112  Miles  and  a  half %0ain  Circuit,  and  is  far  from  Persis ;  and  Access  to  it  is  only %0aby  one  narrow  Channel.  The  Island  Asgilia  ;  the  Nations %0aNocheti,  Zurachi,  Borgodi,  Catarsei,  and  Nomades :  the %0aRiver  Cynos.  Beyond  that,  Juba  saith,  there  is  no  more %0aNavigation  discovered  on  that  Side,  by  reason  of  the  Rocks. %0aHe  hath  made  no  mention  of  the  Town  Batrasabe  of  the %0a%0a%0aBOOK  VI.]  History  of  Nature.  1 49 %0a%0aOmani,  nor  of  Omana,  which  former  Geographers  have %0aheld  to  be  a  Harbour  of  great  Importance  in  Carmania. %0aAlso,  Omne  and  Athanae,  which  our  Merchants  report  to  be %0aat  this  Day  two  very  famous  Towns,  frequented  from  the %0aPersian  Gulf.  Beyond  the  River  Canis,  as  King  Juba %0awriteth,  there  is  a  Hill  which  seemeth  all  scorched.  The %0aNations  of  the  Epimaranitae :  and  soon  after  the  Ichthyo- %0aphagi  :  a  desert  Island  ;  the  Nations  Bathymi.  The  Moun- %0atains Eblitaei ;  the  Island  Omcenus  ;  the  Port  Machorbae,  the %0aIslands  Etaxalos,  Onchobrice,  the  Nation  Chadaei.  Many %0aIslands  without  a  Name  :  but  of  Importance,  Isura,  Rhinnea  ; %0aand  another  very  near,  wherein  are  Pillars  of  Stone  inscribed %0awith  unknown  Characters.  The  Port  of  Goboea;  and  the %0adesert  Islands  Bragae.  The  Nation  of  the  Thaludsei :  the %0aRegion  Dabanegoris :  the  Mountain  Orsa,  with  a  Port : %0athe  Bay  Duatus,  and  many  Islands.  The  Mountain  Tricory- %0aphus :  the  Region  Cardalena,  the  Islands  Solanidae,  Capina. %0aAlso  the  Islands  of  the  Ichthyophagi :  and  after  them  the %0aGlari.  The  Shore  called  Hamruaeum,  where  are  Gold  Mines. %0aThe  Region  Canauna.  The  Nations  Apitami  and  Gasani. %0aThe  Island  Deuadae;  the  Fountain  Goralus;  theGarpheti; %0athe  Islands  Aleu  and  Amnamethu.  The  Nation  called %0aDarrae,  the  Islands  Chelonitis,  and  many  of  the  Ichthyo- %0aphagi. The  Isle  Eodanda,  which  is  Desert,  and  Basage  ; %0amany  others  of  the  Sabaei.  The  Rivers  Thamar  and  Amnon  ; %0athe  Islands  Dolicae ;  the  Fountains  Daulotes  and  Dora ;  the %0aIslands,  Pteros,  Labanis,  Coboris,  Sambracate,  with  a  Town %0aso  named  on  the  Continent.  On  the  South  side  are  many %0aIslands,  but  the  greatest  of  them  is  Camari.  The  River %0aMysecros ;  the  Port  Leupas,  and  the  Sabaeans,  called  Sce- %0anitae.  Many  other  Islands  ;  their  Chief  Town  of  Merchandise %0ais  Acila,  where  the  Merchants  embark  for  their  Voyage  to %0aIndia.  The  Region  Amithoscuta,  and  Damnia.  The  Mizi, %0athe  Greater  and  Less  :  the  Drimati  and  Macae.  The  Promon- %0atory of  these  People  is  overagainst  Carmania,  and  distant %0afrom  it  50  Miles.  A  wonderful  thing  is  reported  there  :  that %0aNumenius,  Chief  Commander  under  King  Antiochus,  over %0aMesena,  conquered  the  Navy  of  the  Persians  in  a  Sea-fight, %0a%0a%0a150  History  of  Nature.  [BOOK  VI. %0a%0aand  on  the  same  Day,  with  the  return  of  the  Tide,  sub- %0adued their  Horsemen :  in  memorial  of  which  he  erected  in %0athe  same  Place  two  Trophies,  one  in  honour  of  Jupiter, %0aand  the  other  of  Neptune.  Far  out  at  Sea  there  lieth  an %0aIsland  called  Ogyris,  distant  from  the  Continent  125  Miles, %0aand  containing  in  Circuit  112;  much  renowned  for  the %0aSepulchre  of  King  Erythra,  who  was  buried  there.  Another %0athere  is  no  less  famous,  called  Dioscoridu,  in  the  Sea  Aza- %0anium ;  and  it  is  from  Syagrum,  the  extremest  Cape,  280 %0aMiles.  There  remain  yet  not  spoken  of,  the  Autarides, %0atoward  the  South,  in  the  Mountains,  which  continue  for %0aseven  Days'  journey :  the  Nations  Larendani,  Catabani,  and %0aGebanitse,  who  have  many  Towns,  but  the  greatest  are  Nagia %0aand  Tarnna,  with  65  Temples  within  it,  which  is  a  mark  how %0agreat  it  is.  A  Promontory,  from  which  to  the  Continent  of %0athe  Trogloditse  is  50  Miles.  The  Toani,  Acchitee,  Chatra- %0amotitse,  Tomabei,  Antidalei,  Lexianse,  Agrei,  Cerbani ;  and %0aSabaei,  of  all  the  Arabians  most  famous  for  their  Frankin- %0acense ;  their  Nations  reaching  from  Sea  to  Sea.  Their  Towns %0aon  the  Coast  of  the  Red  Sea  are  Marane,  Marma,  Corolla, %0aand  Sabatra ;  within-land  are  the  Towns  Nascus,  Cardava, %0aCarnus,  and  Tomala,  whence  they  convey  their  Commodities %0aof  Aromatics.  One  part  of  them  are  the  Atramitse,  whose %0aCapital  City,  Sobotale,  had  within  its  Walls  Sixty  Temples. %0aBut  the  Royal  City  of  the  whole  is  Nariaba,  situated  on  a %0aGulf  that  reacheth  into  the  Land  ninety-four  Miles,  full  of %0aIslands,  having  Odoriferous  Trees.  Upon  the  Atramitse, %0awithin  the  Mainland,  are  joined  the  Minaei :  but  the  Ela- %0amitae  inhabit  the  Sea  (Coast),  where  standeth  a  City  also  called %0aElamitum.  To  them  are  joined  the  Cagulatae ;  and  their %0aTown  is  Siby,  which  the  Greeks  name  A  pate.  Then  the %0aArsicodani,  and  Vadei,  with  a  great  Town  :  and  the  Barasei : %0aLichenia,  and  the  Island  Sygaros,  which  Dogs  will  not  enter ; %0aand  if  any  be  put  there,  they  wander  about  the  Shore  until %0athey  die.  A  Deep  Bay,  in  which  are  the  Leanitae,  who  gave %0aname  to  it.  Their  Royal  City  is  Agra :  but  Leana,  or,  as %0aothers  have  it,  ^lana,  is  in  the  Bay.  And  hence  our %0aWriters  have  called  that  Bay  jElaniticum,  which  others %0a%0a%0aBOOK  VI.]  History  of  Nature.  151 %0a%0ahave  termed  JSlenaticum  ;  Artemidorus,  Aleniticum  ;  and %0aJuba,  Lseniticum.  Arabia  is  reported  to  take  in  Circuit  from %0aCharax  to  Leana,  4870  Miles ;  but  Juba  thinketh  it  some- %0awhat less  than  4000.  It  is  widest  in  the  North  Parts,  be- %0atween the  Towns  Herons  and  Charace.  Now  it  remaineth %0athat  we  speak  of  other  Parts  within  the  Midland  thereof. %0aThe  Ancients  joined  the  Nabataei  to  the  Thimanei ;  but  at %0athis  Day  there  are  the  Tavern,  Suelleni,  and  Sarraceni :  the %0aTown  is  Arra,  wherein  all  Business  is  assembled.  The  He- %0arnuatse  and  Analitae ;  the  Towns  Domada  and  Erag£ ;  the %0aThamusians,  with  their  Town  Badanatha;  the  Carrei,  and %0atheir  Town  Chariati ;  the  Achoali,  and  their  Town  Phoda. %0aFurthermore,  the  Minaei,  descended,  as  some  think,  from %0aMinos,  King  of  Crete  ;  whose  Town  Charmaei  is  14  Miles  (in %0aCompass) ;  Mariaba,  Baramalacum,  a  Town  not  to  be  de- %0aspised; likewise  Carnon,  and  the  Rhamei,  who  are  thought %0ato  spring  from  Rhadamanthus,  the  Brother  of  Minos.  The %0aHomeritae,  with  the  Town  Massala ;  the  Hamirci,  Gedra- %0anitae,  Anaprae,  Ilisanitae,  Bochilitae,  Sammei,  and  Amathei ; %0awith  the  Towns,  Nessa  and  Cennesseri.  The  Zamareni,  with %0athe  Towns  Saiace,  Scantate,  and  Bacascani ;  the  Town  Rhi- %0aphearma,  which  in  the  Arabian  Tongue  signifieth  Barley ; %0aalso  the  Autei,  Raui,  Gyrei,  and  Marhatsei ;  the  Helmodones, %0awith  the  Town  Ebode ;  the  Agacturi  in  the  Mountains,  hav- %0aing a  Town  20  Miles  in  Circuit,  wherein  is  a  Fountain  called %0aEmischabales,  which  signifies  the  Camel's  Town  ;  Ampelone, %0aa  Colony  of  the  Milesii ;  the  Town  Actrida ;  the  Calingii, %0awhose  Town  is  named  Mariaba,  which  signifies  Lords  of  all. %0aTowns  Pallon  and  Murannimal,  near  a  River,  by  which  they %0athink  that  the  Euphrates  springeth  forth.  The  Nations %0aAgrei  and  Ammonii ;  the  Town  Athenas  ;  the  Caurarani, %0awhich  signifieth  very  rich  in  Cattle.  The  Caranitae,  Caesani, %0aand  Choani.  There  were  also  Towns  in  Arabia,  held  by %0aGreeks,  as  Arethusa,  Larissa,  and  Chalcis,  which  were %0adestroyed  in  various  Wars.  The  only  Roman  until  this  day %0athat  carried  our  Arms  into  those  Parts  was  jElius  Gallus,  of %0athe  Knightly  Order.  For  Gains  Ccesar,  the  Son  of  Augustus, %0adid  but  look  only  into  Arabia ;  but  Gallus  destroyed  Towns, %0anot  named  by  Authors  that  wrote  before :  Egra,  Annestum, %0a%0a%0a152  History  of  Nature.  [BOOK  VI. %0a%0aEsca,  Magusum,  Tammacum,  Labecia,  and  the  above-named %0aMarieba,  in  Circuit  Six  Miles :  likewise  Caripeta,  the  furthest %0athat  he  went  to.  The  other  matters  he  made  report  of  were, %0athat  the  Nomades  live  on  Milk  and  Wild  Animals  ;  the  rest %0aexpress  Wine,  as  the  Indians  do,  out  of  Dates ;  and  Oil  of %0aSesama.  That  the  Homerites  are  the  most  Populous ;  the %0aMinasi  have  Fruitful  Fields,  full  of  Palm-trees  and  Vine- %0ayards, but  their  Riches  is  in  Cattle.  The  Cembani  and %0aArii  excel  in  Arras,  but  chiefly  the  Chatramotitse.  The %0aCarseans  have  the  largest  Territories  and  most  Fertile %0aFields.  The  Sabsei  are  Richest  in  the  Fertility  of  their %0aWoods,  that  bring  forth  Aromatic  Gums  :  also  in  Mines  of %0aGold ;  having  Water  to  refresh  their  Lands,  and  plenty  of %0aHoney  and  Wax.  Of  the  Spices  that  come  from  thence  we %0awill  speak  in  a  Book  by  itself.  The  Arabians  wear  Mitres,1 %0aor  go  with  their  Hair  long ;  their  Beards  they  shave,  except %0aon  the  upper  Lip ;  and  yet  some  there  are  that  suffer  their %0aBeards  to  grow  long.  But  one  thing  is  surprising,  that  out %0aof  such  a  very  great  number  of  People,  the  one-half  live  by %0aRobbery,  and  the  other  by  Merchandise.  On  the  whole %0athey  are  exceedingly  rich ;  for  with  them  the  Romans  and %0aParthians  leave  very  large  Sums,  for  the  Commodities  out %0aof  their  Woods  and  Seas  which  they  sell  them ;  and  them- %0aselves buy  nothing  of  them  in  return.  Now  will  we  speak  of %0athe  other  Coast  opposite  to  Arabia.  Timosthenes  hath  set %0adown,  that  the  whole  Gulf  was  from  one  End  to  the  other %0aFour  Days'  Sailing :  and  from  Side  to  Side,  Two  Days' ;  the %0aBreadth  of  the  Straits  being  Seven  Miles  over.  Eratosthenes %0asaith,  that  taking  the  Measure  at  the  very  Mouth,  it  is  every %0away  1300  Miles. %0a%0aCHAPTER  XXIX. %0a%0aThe  Gulf  of  the  Red  Sea :  likewise  of  the  Trogloditic  and %0a^Ethiopian  Seas. %0a%0aARTEMIDORUS  saith,  that  the  Red  Sea  toward  the  side  of %0aArabia  is  1450  Miles :  but  on  the  Coast  of  the  Trogloditse  1 1 82, %0a%0a1  It  is  a  question  whether  these  are  not  rather  turbans,  as  at  present %0aextensively  worn  through  Asia. — Wern,  Club. %0a%0a%0aBOOK  VI.]  History  of  Nature.  153 %0a%0auntil  you  come  to  Ptolemais  :  but  Agrippa  1322,  without  any %0adistinction  of  the  Sides.  Most  Geographers  have  set  down %0athe  Breadth  to  be  462  Miles :  and  the  Mouth  of  it  against %0athe  Sun-rising  in  Winter,  (i.  e.  South-west)  some  say,  is  7 %0aMiles  Broad ;  and  others  12.  The  Situation  of  it  is  this : %0aBeyond  the  Bay  called  JElaniticus  there  is  another  Bay %0awhich  the  Arabians  call  jEant,  on  which  standeth  the  Town %0aHeroon.  There  was  also  Cambisu,  between  the  Neli  and %0aMarchandae,  into  which  the  sick  Soldiers  were  conveyed. %0aThe  Nation  of  Tyra  ;  the  Port  Daneon,  from  which  Sesostris, %0aKing  of  Egypt,  was  the  first  that  imagined  to  conduct  a %0aNavigable  Channel  into  the  Nile,  in  that  part  where  it %0arunneth  to  the  Place  called  Delta,  for  the  Space  of  62 %0aMiles ;  which  is  between  the  River  and  the  Red  Sea.  This %0aEnterprise  was  followed  by  Darius,  King  of  the  Persians  : %0aand  afterwards  by  Ptolomceus,  who  also  made  a  Channel %0a100  Feet  in  Breadth,  and  30  Deep,  for  Thirty-Seven  Miles %0aand  a  Half  in  Length,  even  to  the  Bitter  Fountains.  But %0athis  Design  went  no  farther,  through  fear  of  an  Inundation : %0athe  Red  Sea  being  found  to  lie  Three  Cubits  above  the  Land %0aof  Egypt.  Some  allege  that  this  was  not  the  true  cause, %0abut  that  if  the  Sea  were  let  into  the  Nile  the  Water  thereof %0a(of  which  only  they  drink)  would  be  corrupted.  Never- %0atheless the  Way  is  well  frequented  from  the  Egyptian  Sea  ; %0aand  there  are  Three  ordinary  Ways  there :  one  from  Pelu- %0asium  over  the  Sands,  where,  unless  Reeds  be  set  up  in  the %0aGround  for  direction,  no  Path  would  be  found,  because  the %0aWind  bloweth  the  Sand  over  the  Tracts  of  the  Feet.  A %0asecond  beginneth  Two  Miles  beyond  the  Mountain  Casius, %0awhich  after  sixty  Miles  returneth  into  the  Pelusiac  Way. %0aHere  the  Arabians  called  Autei  inhabit.  The  Third  begin- %0aneth at  Gereum,  which  they  call  Adipson,  and  passeth %0athrough  these  same  Arabians,  being  Sixty  Miles  nearer,  but %0afull  of  craggy  Hills,  and  altogether  destitute  of  Water.  All %0athese  Ways  lead  to  Arsinoe,  which  was  built  upon  the  Gulf %0aCharandra  by  Ptolemceus  Philadelphus,  and  bearing  his %0aSister's  Name :  and  he  was  the  first  that  searched  narrowly %0ainto  the  Region  Trogloditicum  ;  and  the  River  that  passeth %0a%0a%0a154  History  of  Nature.  [BooK  VI. %0a%0aby  Arsinoe  he  called  Ptolemseus.  Within  a  little  of  this %0aPlace  there  is  a  small  Town  named  Aennum,  for  which %0asome  write  Philotera.  Beyond  them  are  the  Azarei :  wild %0aArabians  from  Marriages  of  the  Trogloditee.  The  Islands %0aSapyren£  and  Scytala :  and  within  a  little,  Deserts,  unto %0aMyros-hormos,  where  is  the  Fountain  called  Tadnos ;  the %0aMountain  Eos ;  the  Island  Larnbe,  many  Harbours ;  and %0aBerenice,  a  Town  bearing  the  Name  of  the  Mother  of  Phila- %0adelphus ;  to  which  there  is  a  Way  lying  from  Coptos,  as  we %0ahave  said  :  the  Arabians  called  Autei,  and  Gnebadei.  Tro- %0agloditice,  which  the  Ancients  called  Michoe,  and  others %0aMidoe  :  the  Mountain  Pentedactylos.  Certain  Islands  called %0aStenae-de'irse ;  and  others  no  fewer  in  number,  named  Halon- %0anesi :  Cardamine,  and  Topazos,  which  gave  the  Name  to  the %0aprecious  Stone.  A  Bay  full  of  Islands,  of  which  that  which %0ais  called  Mareu  is  well  supplied  with  Water  :  another,  called %0aEratonos,  is  altogether  Dry.  There  were  Governors  there %0aunder  the  King.  Within-land  inhabit  the  Candei,  whom %0athey  call  Ophiophagi,  because  they  are  accustomed  to  feed %0aon  Serpents;  and  in  truth  there  is  no  other  Region  that %0abreeds  them  more  than  this.  Juba,  who  seemeth  to  have %0avery  diligently  searched  into  these  things,  hath  omitted  in %0athis  Tract  (unless  there  be  some  fault  in  his  Original),  to %0aspeak  of  a  second  Berenice,  which  is  denominated  Pan- %0achrysos ;  as  also  of  a  third  called  Epidires,  renowned  for  its %0aSituation ;  for  it  stands  upon  a  Neck  of  Land  running  a  long %0away,  where  the  Mouth  of  the  Red  Sea  is  not  above  Four %0aMiles  and  a  Half  from  Arabia.  There  is  the  Island  Cytis, %0aitself  producing  Topazes.  Beyond  this  are  Woods,  where %0aPtolemceus,  surnamed  Philadelphia,  built  a  City  for  Hunt- %0aing the  Elephant,  near  the  Lake  Monoleus,  and  named  it %0aEpitheras.  This  is  the  Region  mentioned  by  me  in  the %0aSecond  Book;  wherein  for  Forty-five  Days  before  Mid- %0aSummer,  and  as  many  after,  at  the  Sixth  Hour  of  the  Day, %0ano  Shadows  are  to  be  seen :  which  being  past,  all  the  Day %0aafter  they  fall  into  the  South  ;  and  on  other  Days  they  fall %0ato  the  North ;  whereas,  in  Berenice,  which  we  mentioned %0afirst,  on  the  very  Day  of  the  Solstice,  at  the  Sixth  Hour,  the %0a%0a%0aBOOK  VI.]  History  of  Nature.  155 %0a%0aShadows  are  wholly  lost;  and  otherwise  there  is  nothing %0anew  to  be  observed  for  the  space  of  600  Miles  about  Ptole- %0amais :  a  thing  worthy  of  observation,  and  a  place  of  great %0aCuriosity,  that  gave  great  Light  to  the  World ;  for  Erato- %0asthenes, upon  this  undoubted  argument  of  the  Shadows,  took %0ain  hand  to  deduce  the  Measure  of  the  Earth.

The  Town  Suchse ;  the  Island %0aDaphnis,  and  the  Town  Aduliton,  built  by  Egyptian  Slaves %0awho  escaped  from  their  Masters.  This  is  the  greatest  Town %0aof  Traffic  of  the  Trogloditse,  as  well  as  of  the  Egyptians  :  and %0ait  is  (from  Ptolemais)  Five  Days'  Sailing.  Thither  are  brought %0avery  much  Ivory  and  Horns  of  the  Rhinoceros,  Skins  of  the %0aHippopotamus,  Tortoise  Shells,  Monkeys,  and  Slaves.  Above %0aare  the  Ethiopians,  called  Aroteres :  also  the  Islands  named %0aAliseu :  and  Islands  named  Bacchias,  Antibacchias,  and %0aStrathonis;  beyond  them  there  is  a  Gulf  in  the  Coast  of %0aEthiopia,  as  yet  not  known,  a  thing  to  be  wondered  at,  con- %0asidering that  Merchants  search  into  remoter  Parts.  Also  a %0aPromontory,  wherein  is  a  Fountain  named  Cucios,  much %0adesired  by  Sailors.  Beyond  it  is  the  Port  of  Isis,  distant %0afrom  the  Town  of  the  Adulitse  ten  Days  rowing  with  Oars  : %0aand  thither  is  Myrrh  collected  by  the  Trogloditse.  Before %0athis  Harbour  are  two  Islands,  named  Pseudopylse  ;  and  as %0amany  further  within,  called  Pylse ;  in  one  of  them  are  some %0aPillars  of  Stone,  engraved  with  unknown  Characters.

From  a  Promontory  of  the  Indians  called %0aLepteacra,  and  by  others  Drepanum,  to  the  Isle  of  Malchu, %0ahe  layeth  it  down  that  by  a  straight  Course  it  is  1500 %0aMiles,  beside  those  Parts  that  are  burnt  up.  From  thence %0ato  a  place  called  Sceneos  is  225  Miles :  and  from  it  to  the %0aIsland  Sadanum,  150  Miles :  and  thus  it  is  made  to  the  open %0aSea  1885  Miles.  But  all  other  Writers  have  been  of  opinion %0athat  there  could  not  be  any  Sailing  on  it,  for  the  exceeding %0aHeat  of  the  Sun.  Moreover,  the  Arabians  named  Ascitse  do %0amuch  harm  from  the  Islands  to  the  Trade  :  for  these  Ara- %0abians join  Bottles  made  of  Ox  Leather,  two  and  two  toge- %0ather, as  if  they  were  a  Bridge,  and  exercise  Piracy  by %0ashooting  their  Poisoned  Arrows.

He  nameth  also  the  Bargeni,  Zagerae,  Chalybse, %0aSaxinse,  Syrecae,  Daremae,  and  Domazanes.  Also  he  affirmeth, %0athat  the  People  inhabiting  along  the  Sides  of  the  Nile,  from %0aSyene  to  Meroe,  are  not  ^Ethiopians,  but  Arabians,  who  for %0athe  sake  of  Fresh  Water  approached  the  Nile,  and  there %0adwelt :  as  also  that  the  City  of  the  Sun,1  which  we  said  be- %0afore in  the  Description  of  Egypt,  standeth  not  far  from  Mem- %0aphis, was  founded  by  the  Arabians.

It  was  the  Egyptian  Wars  that  wasted  Ethiopia ; %0asometimes  by  Ruling,  and  at  others  by  Servitude ;  it  was  Illus- %0atrious and  Powerful  until  the  Reign  of  King  Memnon,  who %0aruled  in  the  Time  of  the  Trojan  War,  so  that  Syria  was  sub- %0aject to  it;  as  also  our  own  Coast  in  the  Time  of  King  Cepheus, %0aas  appeareth  by  the  Fables  of  Andromeda.  In  the  same %0amanner  they  disagree  about  the  Measure  of  Ethiopia.

But  Erato- %0asthenes precisely  noteth,  that  it  is  625  Miles :  Artemidorus, %0a600.  Sebostus  affirmeth,  that  from  the  Frontiers  of  Egypt  it %0ais  1675  Miles ;  from  whence  the  last  rehearsed  Writers  count %0a1270.  But  all  this  difference  is  lately  determined  by  the %0aReport  of  those  Travellers  whom  Nero  sent  to  Discover  those %0aCountries,  who  have  related  that  it  is  862  Miles  from  Syene %0ain  this  manner :  from  Syene  to  Hiera-Sycaminon,  Fifty-four %0aMiles ;  from  thence  to  Tama,  Seventy-five  Miles ;  from  Tama %0ato  the  Euonymites  Country,  the  first  of  the  Ethiopians,  120  ; %0atoAcina,  Fifty-four;  to  Pitara,  Twenty-five;  to  Tergedum, %0a106  Miles.

They  reported,  moreover,  that %0aabout  Meroe,  and  not  before,  the  Herbs  appeared  greener ; %0aand  the  Woods  shewed  somewhat  in  comparison  of  all  the %0away  besides ;  and  they  espied  the  Tracts  of  Elephants  and %0aRhinoceroses.

But  upon  a  part  of  Africa  are  the  Medimni ;  be- %0ayond then  are  Nomades,  who  feed  on  the  Milk  of  Cynoce- %0aphali :  and  the  Olabi  and  Syrbotae,  who  are  reported  to  be %0aEight  Cubits  high.  Aristocreon  saith,  that  on  the  side  of %0aLibya,  Five  Days'  Journey  from  Meroe,  there  is  a  Town %0acalled  Tole  ;  and  Twelve  Days'  Journey  from  thence  is  Esar, %0aa  Town  of  the  Egyptians,  who  fled  from  Psammeticus.

The %0aTown  of  the  next  Island  is  Semberritarum,  under  a  Queen ; %0aanother  called  Asar  ;  and  there  is  a  second  Island  having  in %0ait  the  Town  Daron ;  they  call  the  third  Medoe,  wherein %0astand eth  the  Town  Asel ;  and  a  fourth  named  Garode,  as %0athe  Town  is  also.

Some  Writers %0ahold,  that  this  Tract  is  beautified  with  little  Hills,  pleasantly %0aclad  with  shady  Groves,  wherein  are  the  jEgipanes  and %0aSatyri. %0a%0a1  That  locusts  should  form  a  portion  of  the  food  of  the  people  who %0alive  where  they  abound,  cannot  be  regarded  as  surprising.  John %0athe  Baptist  fed  on  them,  Matt,  iii,  4,  and  Mark,  i.  6.  They  are  still %0aoccasionally  used  for  food  in  the  East.  When  Khosru  Purwis  (Chosroes), %0athe  Sassanian  king  of  Persia,  was  summoned  by  Mohammed  to  adopt  his %0adoctrine,  he  contemptuously  dismissed  the  messengers  of  a  chief  of  "naked %0alocust-eaters."  The  Arabs  eat  the  different  species  of  the  migratory %0alocusts,  and  are  very  fond  of  them,  especially  of  the  red  locust,  which %0awhen  fat  is  called  Jerdd  rnikken.  They  eat  them  either  fried  or  broiled, %0aor  dried  in  an  oven,  or  boiled  with  a  sprinkle  of  salt ;  the  locusts  taste %0alike  dried  sprats.

Clitarchus  wit- %0anesseth,  that  report  was  made  to  Alexander  the  King,  of  one %0awhich  was  so  rich,  that  for  Horses  the  Inhabitants  would %0agive  Talents  of  Gold  ;  also  of  another,  wherein  was  a  sacred %0aMountain  adorned  with  a  shady  Wood,  where  the  Trees %0adistilled  Odours  of  wonderful  Sweetness.  Overagainst  the %0aPersian  Gulf  lieth  the  Island  named  Cerne,  opposite  to %0aEthiopia;  but  how  large  it  is,  or  how  far  off  from  the  Con- %0atinent, is  not  certainly  known :  but  this  is  reported,  that %0athe  Ethiopians  only  inhabit  it.  Euphorus  writeth,  that  they %0awho  would  Sail  thither  from  the  Red  Sea,  are  not  able,  from %0athe  extreme  Heat,  to  pass  beyond  certain  Columns ;  for  so %0athey  call  the  little  Islands  there.  But  Polybms  affirmeth, %0athat  this  Island  Cerne,  where  it  lieth  in  the  utmost  Coast  of %0aMauritania,  overagainst  the  Mountain  Atlas,  is  but  Eight %0aStadia  from  the  Land.  On  the  other  hand,  Nepos  Cornelius %0aaffirmeth,  that  it  is  not  above  a  Mile  from  the  Land, %0aoveragainst  Carthage ;  and  that  it  is  not  above  Two  Miles %0ain  Circuit.  There  is  mention  made  also  of  another  Island %0abefore  the  Mountain  Atlas,  and  which  is  named  Atlantis. %0aAnd  Five  Days'  Sailing  from  it  are  the  Deserts  of  the %0aEthiopian  Hesperians,  and  a  Promontory,  which  we  have %0anamed  Hesperion-Ceras ;  where  the  Coasts  of  the  Land  begin %0afirst  to  turn  about  their  front  to  the  westward,  and  the %0aAtlantic  Sea.  Overagainst  this  Promontory,  as  Xenophon %0aLampsacenus  reporteth,  lie  the  Islands  called  Gorgates, %0awhere  formerly  the  Gorgani  kept  their  Habitation,  two %0aDays'  Sailing  from  the  Continent.  Hanno,  Commander  of %0athe  Carthaginians  (Pceni),  penetrated  to  them,  and  reported %0athat  the  Women  were  all  over  their  Bodies  hairy ;  and  that %0athe  Men  were  so  Swift  of  Foot  that  they  escaped  from  him  ; %0abut  he  placed  the  Skins  of  two  of  these  Gorgon  Women  in %0athe  Temple  of  Juno,  for  a  Testimonial,  and  as  a  Wonder,  and %0a%0a%0a164  History  of  Nature.  [BOOK  VI. %0a%0athey  were  seen  there  until  Carthage  was  taken.  Beyond %0athese  Isles  also  there  are  said  to  be  two  Islands  of  Hesperides. %0aBut  so  uncertain  are  all  things  concerning  these  parts,  that %0aStatins  Sebosus  affirmeth,  it  is  Forty  Days'  Sailing  from  the %0aIslands  of  the  Gorgones  along  the  Coast  of  Atlas,  to  the %0aIsles  of  the  Hesperides ;  and  from  thence  to  Hesperion- %0aCeras,  one.  As  little  certainty  there  is  concerning  the %0aIslands  of  Mauritania.  In  this  only  they  all  agree,  that  Juba %0adiscovered  some  few  of  them  over  against  the  Autololes,  in %0awhich  he  purposed  to  dye  Gsetulian  Purple.1 %0a%0aCHAPTER  XXXII. %0aOf  the  Fortunate  Islands. %0a%0aSOME  Authors  think,  that  the  Fortunate  Islands,  and %0asome  others  besides  them,  are  beyond  the  Autololes  ;  among %0awhom  the  same  Sebosus  spoke  of  their  Distances :  and  parti- %0acularly that  the  Island  Junonia  is  from  Gades  750  Miles ; %0aand  that  from  it  westward  the  Isles  Pluvialia  and  Capraria %0aare  as  much :  also  that  in  the  Island  Pluvialia  there  is  no %0aWater  but  what  they  have  by  Showers.  From  them  to  the %0aFortunate  Islands  is  250  Miles  ;  they  lie  eight  Miles  from  the %0aCoast  of  Mauritania  to  the  Left  Hand,  called  the  Coast  of %0athe  Sun,  in  a  Valley,  because  it  is  like  a  Valley  or  Hollow ; %0aand  it  is  also  called  Planaria,  as  resembling  an  even  Plain. %0aThis  Valley  containeth  in  Circuit  300  Miles:  wherein  are %0aTrees  so  luxuriant  that  they  grow  to  the  Height  of  144 %0aFeet.  Concerning  the  Islands  named  Fortunate,  Juba %0alearned  by  diligent  inquiry,  that  they  lie  from  the  South %0anear  to  the  West  625  Miles  from  the  Islands  Purpurariee : %0aso  that  to  Sail  thither  a  Man  must  pass  250  Miles  above  the %0aWest,  and  then  for  75  Miles  bend  his  course  Eastward.  He %0asaith,  moreover,  that  the  first  of  these  Islands  is  called  Om- %0abrion,  wherein  are  no  Tokens  of  Houses.  Also  that  among %0athe  Mountains  it  hath  a  Marsh ;  and  Trees  resembling  the %0aPlant  Ferula,  out  of  which  they  press  WTater :  that  which %0a%0a1  On  which  account  in  the  next  chapter  these  islands  are  called %0aPurpurese, — Wern,  Club, %0a%0a%0aBOOK  VI.]  History  of  Nature.  165 %0a%0aissueth  out  of  the  Black  Trees  being  bitter,  and  that  from %0athe  Whiter  sort  sweet  and  potable.  He  saith  that  a  second %0aIsland  is  named  Junonia,  in  which  there  is  one  little  House, %0aor  Chapel,  made  of  Stone :  beyond  it,  but  near  by  there  is  a %0athird  of  the  same  Name,  but  less  in  size :  and  then  you  come %0ato  one  called  Capraria,  full  of  great  Lizards.  Within  sight %0aof  these  is  the  Island  Nivaria,  which  took  this  Name  from %0athe  Snow  that  lieth  there  continually  ;  it  is  also  full  of  Mists. %0aThe  next  to  it  is  Canaria,  so  called  from  the  great  number  of %0avery  large  Dogs,  of  which  Juba  brought  away  two  :  and  in %0athis  Island  there  are  some  marks  remaining  of  Buildings. %0aAnd  as  all  these  Islands  abound  plentifully  with  fruitful %0aTrees  and  Birds  of  all  sorts,  so  this  is  replenished  with %0aPalm-trees  that  bear  Abundance  of  Dates,  and  likewise  with %0aTrees  that  yield  Pine  Nuts.  There  is  also  great  plenty  of %0aHoney  :  and  the  Rivers  produce  the  Papyrus  Reed,  and  are %0awell  stored  with  the  Fish  Silurus  :  and  in  conclusion  he %0asaith,  that  these  Islands  are  much  infested  with  great  Ani- %0amals, that  are  very  often  cast  out  in  a  Putrid  Condition. %0aThus  having  at  large  gone  through  the  Description  of  the %0aGlobe  of  the  Earth,  as  well  without  as  within,  it  remaineth %0anow  to  collect  into  a  small  space  the  measure  of  the  Seas. %0a%0aCHAPTER  XXXIII. %0a%0aA  Summary  of  the  Earth,  digested  according  to  its %0aDimensions. %0a%0aPOLYBIUS  layeth  it  down,  that  from  the  Straits  of  Gib- %0araltar by  a  straight  Course  to  the  Mouth  of  Moeotis  is  3437J %0aMiles.  From  the  same  starting-place  by  a  right  Course  east- %0award to  Sicily,  it  is  1260J  Miles ;  to  Crete,  375  Miles ;  to %0aRhodes,  146£  Miles ;  to  the  Chelidonian  Islands  as  much ; %0ato  Cyprus,  325  Miles ;  from  whence  to  Seleucia  Pieria  in %0aSyria,  115  Miles.  Which  computation  makes  the  sum  of %0a2340  Miles.  Agrippa  also  counteth  3440  Miles  for  all  this %0adistance  from  the  Straits  of  Gibraltar  directly  forward  to  the %0aGulf  of  Issa.  In  which  reckoning  I  scarcely  know  whether %0athere  be  an  error  in  the  number,  because  the  same  Writer %0a%0a%0a166  History  of  Nature.  [BOOK  VI. %0a%0ahath  set  down  the  passage  from  the  Sicilian  Strait  to  Alex- %0aandria at  1250  Miles.  But  the  whole  .  Circuit  through  the %0aabove-said  Gulfs,  from  the  point  where  we  began  to  the  Lake %0aMoeotis,  summed  together,  is  15,600  Miles.  Artemidorus %0aadded  thereto  756  Miles.  And  the  same  Geographer %0awriteth,  that  with  Moeotis  it  cometh  to  17,390  Miles.  This %0ais  the  measure  of  unarmed  Men,  and  the  peaceful  boldness %0aof  such  as  have  not  feared  to  provoke  Fortune.  Now %0aare  we  to  compare  the  greatness  of  each  part,  in  spite  of %0athe  Difficulty  produced  by  the  Disagreement  of  Authors. %0aBut  most  easily  will  this  appear  if  we  join  Longitude  and %0aLatitude  together.  According  to  this  prescribed  rule  the %0aMagnitude  of  Europe  is  8148  Miles.  Africa  (taking  the %0amiddle  Computation  between  them  all  that  have  set  it  down) %0acontaineth  in  Length  3748  Miles.  The  Breadth  of  so  much %0aas  is  inhabited  in  no  Place  exceedeth  250  Miles.  Agrippa %0awould  have  it  to  contain  910  Miles  in  Breadth,  beginning  at %0athe  Bounds  of  Cyrene,  and  comprehending  in  this  Measure %0athe  Deserts  thereof  as  far  as  to  the  Garamantse,  so  far  as %0athey  are  known ;  and  then  the  whole  Measure  collected  into %0aone  sum  amounted  to  4608  Miles.  Asia1  is  allowed  to  be  in %0aLength  63,750  Miles ;  and  its  Breadth  is  truly  reckoned %0afrom  the  Ethiopian  Sea  to  Alexandria,  situated  near  the %0aNile,  so  that  the  Measurement  runs  through  Meroe  and %0aSyrene,  1875  Miles;  whereby  it  appeareth  that  Europe  is %0alittle  wanting  of  being  half  as  large  again  as  Asia :  and  the %0asame  Europe  is  twice  as  much  again  as  all  Africa,  and  a %0asixth  part  over.  Reduce  now  all  these  sums  together,  and  it %0awill  be  found  clear  that  Europe  is  a  third  part  of  the  whole %0aEarth,  and  something  more  than  an  eighth  Portion  over; %0aAsia  a  fourth  part,  with  a  fourteenth;  and  Africa  a  fifth, %0awith  an  over-plus  of  a  sixtieth  portion.  To  this  Calculation %0awe  will  add  one  sentence  of  Greek  invention,  which  sheweth %0a%0a1  Pliny's  ignorance  of  the  extent  of  Africa  is  pardonable,  for  he  knew %0ano  more  of  it  than  the  small  portion  which  had  come  under  the  Roman %0adominion ;  but  in  his  account  of  Asia  he  contradicts  what  he  has  already %0aassigned  to  India,  which  is  only  a  part  of  it,  but  which  he  truly  repre- %0asented to  be  larger  than  Europe.— Wern.

To  bring  this  about  effectually,  I  must %0aarrange  the  whole  Earth  into  certain  Portions  of  the  Heaven  ; %0afor  there  are  very  many  of  those  Divisions  of  the  World  which %0aour  Astronomers  call  Circles,  and  the  Greeks,  Parallels. %0a%0aCHAPTER  XXXIV. %0a%0aThe  Arrangement  of  the  Earth  Into  Parallels  and  equal %0aShadows. %0a%0aTHE  beginning  is  at  that  part  of  India  which  turns  to  the %0aSouth.  It  extends  as  far  as  Arabia  and  the  Inhabitants  of %0athe  Red  Sea.  Under  it  are  comprised  the  Gedrosi,  Persae, %0aCarmani,  and  Elimaei ;  Parthyen&,  Aria,  Susiane,  Mesopo- %0atamia, Seleucia,  surnamed  Babylonia ;  Arabia,  so  far  as %0aPetrge,  Coele-Syria,  and  Pelusium  in  Egypt;  the  Lower %0aCoasts,  which  are  called  of  Alexandria ;  the  Maritime  Parts %0aof  Africa;  all  the  Towns  of  Cyrenaica,  Thapsus,  Adrume- %0atum,  Clupea,  Carthago,  Utica,  both  Hippoes,  Numidia,  both %0aRealms  of  Mauritania,  the  Atlantic  Sea,  and  Hercules'  Pil- %0alars.

The  Longest  Night  or  Day  is  fourteen %0aHours;  and  the  shortest,  ten.  The  following  Circle  begin- %0aneth  from  India,  tending  westward,  and  passeth  through %0athe  midst  of  Parthia,  Persepolis,  the  nearest  parts  of  Persis, %0athe  nearer  Arabia,  Judaea,  and  the  Borders  of  the  Mountain %0aLibanus.

The  Longest  Day  or  Night  is  four- %0ateen Hours  Equinoctial,  and  the  fifth  part  of  an  Hour.

To  a  Gnomon  of  nine  Feet %0athe  Shadow  is  eight  Feet.  The  Longest  Day  hath  fifteen %0aEquinoctial  Hours  and  the  ninth  part  of  an  Hour,  or  the %0afifth,  as  Nigidius  is  of  opinion.  The  seventh  Division  be- %0aginneth  at  the  other  Coast  of  the  Caspian  Sea,  and  falleth %0aupon  Callatis,  Bosphorus,  Borysthenes,  Tomos,  the  Back %0aParts  of  Thracia,  the  Tribali,  the  rest  of  Illyricum,  the %0aAdriatic  Sea,  Aquileia,  Altinum,  Venetia,  Vicetia,  Patavium, %0aVerona,  Cremona,  Ravenna,  Ancona,  Picenum,  Marsi, %0aPeligni,  Sabini,  Umbria,  Ariminum,  Bononia,  Placentia, %0aMediolanum,  and  all  beyond  Apenninum :  also  over  the %0aAlps,  Aquitaine  in  Gaul,  Vienna,  Pyrenaeum,  and  Celtiberia. %0aThe  Gnomon  of  thirty-five  Feet  casteth  a  Shadow  thirty-six %0aFeet  in  Length  ;  yet  so,  that  in  some  part  of  Venetia  the %0aShadow  is  equal  to  the  Gnomon.  The  Longest  Day  is  fif- %0ateen Equinoctial  Hours,  and  three-fifth  parts  of  an  hour. %0aHitherto  we  have  reported  the  exact  Labours  of  the  Ancients. %0aBut  the  most  diligent  Modern  Writers  have  assigned  the  rest %0aof  the  Earth  not  as  yet  specified,  to  three  Sections.  (The %0afirst)  from  Tanais  through  the  Lake  Moaotis  and  the  Sar- %0amatae,  all  the  way  to  Borysthenes,  and  so  by  the  Daci  and  a %0apart  of  Germany,  the  Galliae,  and  the  Coasts  of  the  sur- %0arounding Ocean,  where  the  Day  is  sixteen  Hours  long.  A %0asecond,  through  the  Hyperborei  and  Britannia,  where  the %0aDay  is  seventeen  Hours  long.  Last  of  all,  is  the  Scythian %0aParallel,  from  the  Rhiphean  Hills  unto  Thule :  in  which  (as %0a%0a%0a170  History  of  Nature,  [BooK  VI. %0a%0awe  have  said)  it  is  Day  and  Night  continually  by  turns. %0aThe  same  Writers  have  set  down  two  Circles,  before  those %0aPoints  where  the  others  began,  and  which  we  set  down. %0aThe  first  through  the  Island  Meroe,  and  Ptolemais  upon  the %0aRed  Sea,  built  for  the  Hunting  of  Elephants ;  where  the %0aLongest  Day  is  but  twelve  Hoars  and  an  half:  the  second %0apassing  through  Syene  in  Egypt,  where  the  Day  hath  thir- %0ateen Hours.

It  was  not  enough %0a%3c for  the  Ocean  to  have  environed  the  whole %0a%3c Earth,  and  to  have  taken  away  a  great  part  of  it,  with %0a%3c exceeding  Rage  ;  it  sufficed  not,  to  have  broken  through  the %0a%3c shattered  Mountains,  and  also  having  torn  Calpe1  from %0a%3c Africa,  to  have  swallowed  up  a  much  larger  space  than  it %0a%3c left  behind :  nor  to  have  poured  out  Propontis  through  the %0a%3c Hellespont,2  so  again  devouring  the  Land :  from  the  Bos- %0a%3c phorus  also  it  is  spread  abroad  into  a  large  Space  without %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  Mouth  of  Gibraltar. %0a%3c %0a%3c 8  The  ideas  of  the  ancients  appear  to  have  been  confounded  in  the  wide %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 100  History  of  Nature.

And  that  this  hath %0a%3c happened  in  spite  of  the  Earth,  appeareth  by  so  many %0a%3c Straits  and  such  narrow  Passages  of  opposing  nature, %0a%3c considering  that  at  the  Hellespont  the  Breadth  is  not %0a%3c above  875  Paces :  and  at  the  two  Bosphori  even  Oxen  easily %0a%3c pass  over :  and  hereupon  they  both  took  their  Name :  and  in %0a%3c this  disunion  appeareth  an  agreement  of  relationship.  For %0a%3c Cocks  may  be  heard  to  crow,  and  Dogs  to  bark  from  one %0a%3c Side  to  the  other :  and  by  the  interchange  of  Human  Speech %0a%3c Men  out  of  these  two  Worlds  may  talk  one  to  another  in %0a%3c continued  discourse,  if  the  Winds  do  not  carry  away  the %0a%3c Sound. %0a%3c %0a%3c Some  have  made  the  Measure  of  Pontus  from  the  Bos- %0a%3c phorus  to  the  Lake  Moeotis  to  be  1438  Miles.  But  Erato- %0a%3c sthenes reckoneth  it  less  by  one  hundred.  Agrippa  saith, %0a%3c that  from  Chalcedon  to  Phasis  is  a  thousand  Miles;  and %0a%3c onward  to  Bosphorus  Cimmerius,  360  Miles.  We  will  set %0a%3c down  in  general  the  Distances  of  Places  collected  in  our  own %0a%3c Days,  when  our  Armies  have  carried  on  WTar  even  in  the %0a%3c very  Mouth  of  the  Cimmerian  Strait. %0a%3c %0a%3c Beyond  the  Straits  of  the  Bosphorus  is  the  River %0a%3c Rhebas,  which  some  have  called  Rhcesus:  and  beyond  it, %0a%3c Psillis  :  the  Port  of  Calpas  ;  and  Sangarius,  one  of  the  prin- %0a%3c cipal Rivers :  it  ariseth  in  Phrygia,  receiveth  large  Rivers %0a%3c into  it,  and  amongst  the  rest  Tembrogius  and  Gallus.  The %0a%3c same  Sangarius  is  by  many  called  Coralius ;  from  which %0a%3c begin  the  Gulfs  Mariandirii  and  the  Town  Heraclea,  situated %0a%3c upon  the  River  Lycus.  It  is  from  the  Mouth  of  Pontus %0a%3c 200  Miles.  There  is  the  Port  Acone,  cursed  with  the %0a%3c poisonous  Aconitum  ;  and  the  Cave  Acherusia.  The  Rivers %0a%3c Pedopiles,  Callichorum,  and  Sonantes.

The  Town  Mastya  of  the  Milesians  :  and %0a%3c next  to  it  Cromna.  In  this  quarter  the  Heneti  inhabit,  as %0a%3c Cornelius  Nepos  saith,  from  whom  the  Veneti  in  Italy,  who %0a%3c bear  their  Name,  are  descended,  as  he  would  have  us  believe. %0a%3c The  Town  Sesamum,  which  is  now  called  Amastris.  The %0a%3c Mountain  Cytorus,  64  Miles  from  Tium.  The  Towns %0a%3c Cimolus  and  Stephane ;  the  River  Parthenius ;  the  Pro- %0a%3c montory Corambis,  which  reacheth  a  mighty  way  into %0a%3c the  Sea;  and  it  is  from  the  Mouth  of  the  Pontus  315 %0a%3c Miles,  or  as  others  think,  350.  It  is  also  as  far  from  the %0a%3c (Strait)  Cimmerius,  or  as  some  would  rather  have  it,  312 %0a%3c Miles  and  a  half.  A  Town  there  was  also  of  that  Name : %0a%3c and  another  beyond  it  called  Arminum  :  but  now  there  is  the %0a%3c Colony  Sinope,  164  Miles  from  Citorum.  The  River  Vare- %0a%3c tum ;  the  People  of  the  Cappadoces ;  the  Town  Gaziura, %0a%3c and  Gazelum  ;  the  River  Halys,  which,  issuing  out  of  the %0a%3c foot  of  Taurus,  passeth  through  Cataonia  and  Cappadocia. %0a%3c The  Towns,  Grangre,  Carissa ;  the  Free  City  Amisum,  distant %0a%3c from  Sinope  130  Miles.  A  Gulf,  bearing  the  Name  of  this %0a%3c Town,  runneth  so  far  within  the  Land  that  it  seemeth  to %0a%3c make  Asia  almost  an  Island :  for  from  thence  through  th^e %0a%3c Continent  to  the  Gulf  Issicus  in  Cilicia,  is  not  above  200 %0a%3c Miles.  In  all  which  Tract  there  are  no  more  than  three %0a%3c Nations  which  justly  may  be  called  Greeks:  which  are  the %0a%3c Dorians,  lonians,  and  ^Eolians  :  for  all  the  rest  are  Bar- %0a%3c barians. To  Amisum  there  was  joined  the  Town  Eupa- %0a%3c toria,  founded  by  Mithridates  :  and  when  he  was  vanquished, %0a%3c both  together  took  the  Name  of  Pompeiopolis.1 %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  From  Pompey  the  Great,  who  conquered  him. —  Wern.

The  Town  Comana,  by  which  the  (River)  Sarus %0a%3c runneth:  Neo-Csesarea,  washed  by  the  Lycus :  and  Amasia, %0a%3c on  the  River  Iris,  in  the  Country  Gazacena.  In  Colopena, %0a%3c also,  are  Sebastia  and  Sebastopolis :  little  Towns,  but  equal %0a%3c with  those  abovesaid.  In  the  other  part  (of  Cappadocia)  is %0a%3c the  City  Melita,  built  by  Queen  Semiramis,  not  far  from  the %0a%3c Euphrates :  also,  Dio-Csesarea,  Tyana,  Castabala,  Magno- %0a%3c polis,  Zela  :  and  under  the  Mountain  Argseus,  Mazaca,  which %0a%3c now  is  named  Csesarea.  That  part  of  Cappadocia  which  lieth %0a%3c before  Armenia  the  Greater,  is  called  Meliten£ :  that  which %0a%3c bordereth  upon  Comagene,  Cataonia :  upon  Phrygia,  Gar- %0a%3c sauritis  :  upon  Sargaurasana,  Cammanen£ :  and  upon  Ga- %0a%3c latia,  Morimen£.  And  there  the  River  Cappadox  separateth %0a%3c the  one  from  the  other.  From  this  River  the  Cappadocians %0a%3c took  their  Name,  having  formerly  been  called  Leucosyri. %0a%3c The  River  Lycus  divideth  the  above-named  new  Armenia %0a%3c from  Neo-Csesarea.  Within  the  Country  there  runneth  also %0a%3c the  famous  Ceraunus.  But  on  the  Coast  beyond  Amysum  is %0a%3c the  Town  Lycastum,  and  the  River  Chadisia:  and  still  fur- %0a%3c ther the  Country  Themiscyra.  The  River  Iris,  bringing %0a%3c down  the  Lycus.  In  the  midland  Parts  the  City  Ziela, %0a%3c ennobled  by  the  slaughter  of  Triarius,*  and  the  Victory  of %0a%3c C.  CcBsar.

And  at  the  same  place,  some  years  afterwards,  Julius  Caesar  gained %0a%3c an  important  victory  over  Pharnaces,  the  son  of  Mithridates,  deprived %0a%3c him  of  the  kingdom  of  Pontus,  and  entirely  ruined  his  army.  It  was  on %0a%3c this  occasion  that  Csesar,  when  describing  the  rapidity  and  despatch  he %0a%3c had  employed  in  the  victory,  made  use  of  the  well-known  sentence, %0a%3c "  Veni,  vidi,  vici,"  I  came,  I  saw,  I  conquered.—  Wern.

Also,  Philocalia,  and  Liviopolis  without  a  River: %0a%3c also,  the  Free  City  Trapezus,  environed  with  a  high  Moun- %0a%3c tain, 100  Miles  from  Pharnacea.  Beyond  Trapezus  is  the %0a%3c Nation  of  the  Armenochalybes,  and  Armenia  the  Greater  : %0a%3c which  are  30  Miles  asunder.  On  the  Coast  is  the  River %0a%3c Pyxites  that  runneth  before  Trapezus:  and  beyond  it  the %0a%3c Nation  of  the  Sanni  Heniochi.  The  River  Absarus,  with  a %0a%3c Castle  likewise  so  named  in  its  Mouth  ;  from  Trapezus  is %0a%3c 150  Miles.  Behind  the  Mountains  of  that  quarter  is  Iberia  : %0a%3c but  in  the  Coast  of  the  same  are  the  Heniochi,  Ampreutae, %0a%3c and  Lazi.

It  had  many  Towns  upon  its  Banks; %0a%3c the  most  celebrated  being  Tyritacen,  Cygnus,  and  Phasis, %0a%3c situated  at  its  very  Mouth.  But  the  most  illustrious  was %0a%3c j£a,  fifteen  Miles  from  the  Sea  :  where  Hippos  and  Cyanos, %0a%3c two  very  great  Rivers,  coming  from  different  Parts,  flow  into %0a%3c it.  Now  it  possesseth  Surium  only,  which  taketh  its  Name %0a%3c from  the  River  Surium,  that  runneth  into  it.  And  thus  far %0a%3c we  said  that  Phasis  was  capable  of  being  navigated  by  great %0a%3c Ships.  And  it  received)  other  Rivers,  remarkable  for  size %0a%3c and  number,  among  which  is  the  River  Glaucus.  In  the %0a%3c Mouth  of  this  River  (Phasis)  there  are  Islands  without  a %0a%3c Name.  It  is  distant  from  Bsarus  75  Miles.  Being  past %0a%3c Phasis,  there  is  another  River  called  Charien  ;  the  Nation  of %0a%3c the  Salae,  named  in  old  Time  Phthirophagi  and  Suani ;  the %0a%3c River  Cobus,  which  issueth  out  of  Caucasus,  and  runneth %0a%3c through  the  Country  of  the  Suani.  Then  Rhoas  ;  the  region %0a%3c Ecrectic£  :  the  Rivers  Sigania,  Tersos,  Atelpos,  Chrysorrhoas, %0a%3c and  the  Nation  Absilse:  the  Castle  Sebastopolis,  a  hundred %0a%3c Miles  from  Phasis  ;  the  Nation  of  the  Sanigares,  the  Town %0a%3c Cygnus,  the  River  and  Town  called  Pityus.  And  last  of  all, %0a%3c the  Nations  of  the  Heniochae,  which  have  many  Names. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  V. %0a%3c %0a%3c The  Region  of  Colchis,  the  Achai,  and  other  Nations  in %0a%3c that  Tract. %0a%3c %0a%3c NEXT  followeth  the  region  of  Colchis,  which  is  likewise %0a%3c in  Pontus  :  wherein  the  craggy  Summits  of  the  Caucasus %0a%3c wind  and  turn  toward  the  Rhiphsean  Mountains,  as  hath  been %0a%3c hinted  ;  on  the  one  side  bending  down  toward  the  Euxinus %0a%3c and  Moeotis ;  and  on  the  other  inclining  to  the  Caspian  and %0a%3c Hircanian  Seas.

Being  past %0a%3c Dioscurias,  there  is  the  Town  Heraclium,  which  from  Sebas- %0a%3c topolis  is  80  Miles  distant.  The  Achaei,  Mardi,  and  Car- %0a%3c cetae :  after  them  the  Serri,  and  Cephalotomi.  Far  within %0a%3c that  Tract  stood  the  very  wealthy  Town  Pitius,  which  by  the %0a%3c Heniochians  was  plundered.  On  the  back  part  thereof %0a%3c inhabit  the  Epageritse,  a  People  of  the  Sarmatae,  upon  the %0a%3c tops  of  the  Caucasus :  after  which  the  Sauromatae.  Hither %0a%3c had  fled  King  Mithridates  in  the  time  of  Prince  Claudius, %0a%3c and  he  made  report  that  the  Thali  dwell  thereby,  and  border %0a%3c Eastward  upon  the  very  opening  of  the  Caspian  Sea:  which %0a%3c becometh  Dry  when  the  Sea  ebbeth.  But  on  the  Coast %0a%3c near  to  the  Cercetae  is  the  River  Icarusa,  with  a  Town  and %0a%3c River  called  Hierum,  136  Miles  from  Heracleum.

Beyond  Cimmerium  inhabit  the  Mceotici, %0a%3c Vati,  Serbi,  Archi,  Zingi,  and  Psesii.  After  this  you  come %0a%3c to  the  River  Tanais,  which  runneth  with  two  Mouths :  and %0a%3c on  the  sides  of  it  dwell  the  Sarmatae,  descended,  as  they  say, %0a%3c from  the  Medi :  but  themselves  divided  into  many  Races. %0a%3c And  first  the  Sauromatae,  surnamed  Gynaecocratumeni,  from %0a%3c whence  the  Amazons  are  provided  with  Husbands.  Next  to %0a%3c them  are  the  Euazae,  Cottae,  Cicimeni,  Messeniani,  Costo- %0a%3c bocci,  Choatrae,  Zigae,  Dandari,  Thussageae,  and  Turcae,  even %0a%3c as  far  as  the  Wilderness,  rough  with  woody  Valleys.  Be- %0a%3c yond them  are  the  Arimphaei,  who  live  upon  the  Riphaaan %0a%3c Mountains.  The  Tanais  itself  the  Scythians  call  Silys  ;  and %0a%3c Moeotis  they  name  Temerinda,1  that  is  to  say,  the  Mother  of %0a%3c the  Sea.  There  stood  also  a  Town  at  the  mouth  of  Tanais. %0a%3c The  Lares  first  inhabited  the  Borders :  afterwards  the  Clazo- %0a%3c menii  and  Moeones:  and  in  process  of  time  the  Panti- %0a%3c capenses.  Some  Authors  write,  that  about  Moeotis  toward %0a%3c the  higher  Mountains  Ceraunii,  the  following  Nations  inhabit %0a%3c on  the  Coast,  the  Napaeae :  and  above  them  the  Essedones, %0a%3c joining  on  the  Colchi,  and  the  tops  of  the  Mountains.  After %0a%3c them  the  Carmacae,  the  Orani,  Antacse,  Mazacae,  Ascantici, %0a%3c Acapeatae,  Agagammatae,  Phycari,  Rhimosoli,  and  Asco- %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  It  is  easy  to  discern  that  many  of  the  names  of  nations  mentioned %0a%3c by  Pliny  are  not  those  which  the  people  themselves  would  have  recog- %0a%3c nised; but  Greek  descriptive  designations.  But  the  word  "  Temerinda" %0a%3c is  believed  to  have  been  u  Scythian,"  and  to  be  rightly  interpreted  by  the %0a%3c author.

Now  are  we  to  speak %0a%3c of  the  People  inhabiting  the  Inland  Parts :  wherein  I  shall %0a%3c advance  many  things  different  from  the  ancient  Geographers : %0a%3c because  I  have  made  diligent  Search  into  the  state  of  those %0a%3c Regions,  especially  by  enquiry  of  Domitius  Corbulo,  in  regard %0a%3c of  the  things  done  by  himself,  and  also  of  the  Kings  who %0a%3c came  from  thence  as  Petitioners,  and  of  those  King's  Sons %0a%3c that  were  Hostages.  And  we  will  begin  with  the  Nation  of %0a%3c the  Cappadocians.  This  is  a  Country  that  of  all  which  bound %0a%3c upon  Pontus,  reacheth  farthest  within  the  Land  :  for  on  the %0a%3c left  Hand  it  passeth  by  the  Greater  and  Less  Armenia,  and %0a%3c Comagene :  and  on  the  right,  all  those  Nations  in  Asia %0a%3c before-named  :  being  overflowed  with  a  Multitude  of  People : %0a%3c and  with  great  Might  climbing  up  Eastward  to  the  Tops  of %0a%3c Taurus,  it  passeth  Lycaonia,  Pisidia,  and  Cilicia  :  and  with %0a%3c that  quarter  which  is  called  Cataonia,  it  pierceth  above  the %0a%3c Tract  of  Antiochia,  and  reacheth  as  far  as  to  its  Region  Cyr- %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 108  History  of  Nature.

And  therefore  the  Length  of  Asia  there  may  con- %0a%3c tain 1250  Miles,  and  the  Breadth  640. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  IX. %0a%3c Armenia,  the  Greater  and  Less. %0a%3c %0a%3c THE  Greater  Armenia,  beginning  at  the  Mountains  Pa- %0a%3c riedri,  is  divided  from  Cappadocia  by  the  River  Euphrates,  as %0a%3c hath  been  said  before :  and  where  the  River  Euphrates %0a%3c turneth,  from  Mesopotamia  by  the  River  Tigris,  scarcely  less %0a%3c renowned  than  the  other.  It  poureth  forth  both  these  Rivers, %0a%3c and  constitutes  the  beginning  of  Mesopotamia,  which  is  situ- %0a%3c ated between  them  both.  The  Land  which  lieth  between  is %0a%3c possessed  by  the  Arabs  Orei.  In  this  manner  it  extendeth  its %0a%3c Border  to  Adiabene.  Beyond  this,  being  hemmed  in  with %0a%3c Mountains  that  stand  across  it,  it  spreadeth  its  Breadth  on %0a%3c the  left  Hand  to  the  River  Cyrus  :  and  then  across  to  the %0a%3c River  Araxes :  but  it  carrieth  its  Length  to  the  Lesser  Ar- %0a%3c menia, being  separated  from  it  by  the  River  Absarus,  which %0a%3c falleth  into  the  Poritus  :  and  by  the  Mountains  Pariedri,  from %0a%3c which  the  River  Absarus  issueth.  The  River  Cyrus  springeth %0a%3c in  the  Mountains  Heniochii,  which  some  have  called  Co- %0a%3c raxici.  The  Araxes  issueth  out  of  the  same  Mountain  from %0a%3c whence  Euphrates  cometh,  and  there  is  not  above  the  Space %0a%3c of  six  Miles  between  them.  This  River  Araxes  is  augmented %0a%3c with  the  River  Musis ;  and  then  itself  loseth  its  Name,  and,  as %0a%3c most  have  thought,  is  carried  by  the  River  Cyrus  into  the  Cas- %0a%3c pian Sea.  These  Towns  are  famous  in  the  Lesser  (Armenia) ; %0a%3c Csesarea,  Aza,  and  Nicopolis.  In  the  Greater  is  Arsamote, %0a%3c near  the  River  Euphrates  ;  and  Carcathiocerta,  upon  the %0a%3c Tigris.  In  the  higher  Country  is  Tigranocerta,  but  in  the %0a%3c Plain,  near  the  Araxes,  Artaxata.  Aufidius  saith,  that  both %0a%3c the  Armenise  contain  in  all  500  Miles.  Claudius  Ccesar %0a%3c reporteth,  that  in  Length  from  Dascusa  to  the  Confines  of %0a%3c the  Caspian  Sea  is  1300  Miles,  and  in  Breadth  half  as  much, %0a%3c from  Tigranocerta  to  Iberia.  This  is  well  known,  that  it  is %0a%3c divided  into  Prefectures,  which  they  call  Strategies  ;  and %0a%3c some  of  them  in  old  time  were  as  large  as  Kingdoms  :  the %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BOOK  VI.]  History  of  Nature.  109 %0a%3c %0a%3c Number  being  120,  with  barbarous  Names.  It  is  enclosed %0a%3c Eastward  with  Mountains,  but  neither  the  Ceraunii,  nor  the %0a%3c Region  Adiabene,  do  immediately  border  on  it.  The  Country %0a%3c of  the  Sopherii  lieth  between  :  next  are  the  Mountains  Ce- %0a%3c raunii ;  and  beyond  them  dwell  the  Adiabeni.  But  through %0a%3c the  flat  Valleys  the  next  Neighbours  to  Armenia  are  the %0a%3c Menobardi  and  Moscheni.  The  River  Tigris  and  steep %0a%3c Mountains  encompass  Adiabene.  On  the  left  Hand  its %0a%3c Region  is  of  the  Medians,  and  the  Prospect  of  the  Caspian %0a%3c Sea.  This  is  poured  in  from  the  Ocean  (as  we  shall  shew  in %0a%3c its  place),  and  is  enclosed  wholly  within  the  Mountains  of %0a%3c Caucasus.  We  will  now  speak  of  the  Inhabitants  of  these, %0a%3c through  the  Confine  of  Armenia. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  X. %0a%3c Albania  and  Iberia. %0a%3c %0a%3c THE  Nation  of  the  Albani  inhabit  all  the  plain  Country %0a%3c from  the  River  Cyrus.  Beyond  it  is  the  Region  of  the  Iberes, %0a%3c who  are  separated  from  the  Albani  by  the  River  Alazon, %0a%3c which  runneth  down  from  the  Caucasian  Mountains  into  the %0a%3c Cyrus.  The  strong  Towns  of  Albania  :  Cabalaca  ;  of  Iberia, %0a%3c Harmastis,  near  the  River  Neoris :  the  Region  Thasie,  and %0a%3c Triare,  as  far  as  to  the  Mountains  Partedori.  Beyond  them %0a%3c are  the  Deserts  of  Colchis:  and  on  the  side  of  them  which %0a%3c lieth  toward  the  Ceraunii  the  Armenochalybes  inhabit :  and %0a%3c the  Tract  of  the  Moschi  to  the  River  Iberus,  that  floweth  into %0a%3c the  Cyrus.  Beneath  them,  inhabit  the  Sacassani,  and  beyond %0a%3c them  the  Macrones,  who  reach  to  the  River  Absarus.  Thus %0a%3c the  Plain  and  the  hanging  of  the  Hills  are  inhabited.  Again, %0a%3c from  the  Frontiers  of  Albania,  in  all  the  front  of  the  Moun- %0a%3c tains are  the  savage  Nations  of  the  Sylvi ;  and  beneath  them, %0a%3c of  the  Lubieni,  and  so  forward  the  Diduri,  and  Sodii. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  XI. %0a%3c The  Gates  of  the  Caucasus. %0a%3c %0a%3c BEYOND  the  Sodii  are  the  Gates  of  Caucasus,  which  many %0a%3c have  very  erroneously  called  Caspise  Portae,  or  the  Caspian %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 110  History  of  Nature.

Beyond  the  Gates  of  Caucasus,  through %0a%3c the  Mountains  Gordyei,  the  Valli  and  Suarrii,  uncivilised %0a%3c Nations,  are  employed  only  in  the  Mines  of  Gold.  Beyond %0a%3c them  as  far  as  to  the  Pontic  Sea,  are  many  Races  of  the %0a%3c Heniochi ;  and  soon  after,  of  the  Achaei.  And  thus  much %0a%3c concerning  this  Tract  of  the  Lands  among  the  most  re- %0a%3c nowned. Some  have  set  down,  that  between  Pontus  and  the %0a%3c Caspian  Sea,  it  is  not  above  375  Miles.  Cornelius  Nepos %0a%3c saith  it  is  but  150;  into  such  Straits  is  Asia  driven  again. %0a%3c Claudius  Ccesar  hath  reported,  that  from  the  Cimmerian %0a%3c Bosphorus  to  the  Caspian  Sea,  is  150  Miles;  and  that  Seleucus %0a%3c Nicator  purposed  to  cut  the  Land  through,  at  the  Time %0a%3c when  he  was  slain  by  Ptolomceus  Ceraunus.  It  is  almost %0a%3c certain,  that  from  the  Gates  of  Caucasus  to  Pontius  is %0a%3c 200  Miles. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  XII. %0a%3c %0a%3c Islands  in  the  Pontus. %0a%3c %0a%3c IN  Pontus  lie  the  Islands  Planctse,  otherwise  Cyaneae  or %0a%3c Symplcgades.  Then  Apollonia,  named  also  Thynnias,  for %0a%3c Distinction  sake  from  that  other  so  named  in  Europe  :  it  is %0a%3c from  the  Continent  one  Mile,  and  in  Circuit  three.  And %0a%3c over-against  Pharnacea  is  Chalceritis,  which  the  Greeks %0a%3c called  Aria,  sacred  to  Mars ;  wherein  are  Birds  which  fight %0a%3c with  a  Blow  of  their  Wings  against  others  that  come %0a%3c %0a%3c thither. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  XIII. %0a%3c %0a%3c Nations  on  the  Scythian  Ocean. %0a%3c %0a%3c HAVING  thus  discoursed  of  all  the  Countries  in  the  inte- %0a%3c rior of  Asia,  let  us  now  determine  to  pass  over  the  Rhiphsean %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BOOK  V I .]  History  of  Nature.  1  ]  1 %0a%3c %0a%3c Mountains,  and  discover  the  Coasts  of  the  Ocean  which  lie %0a%3c on  the  right  hand.  Asia  is  washed  by  this  Ocean  on  three %0a%3c Sides :  on  the  North  Side  is  the  Scythian :  on  the  East  it  is %0a%3c called  Eous :  and  from  the  South  they  name  it  the  Indian. %0a%3c And  according  to  the  various  Gulfs,  and  the  Inhabitants,  it  is %0a%3c divided  into  many  Names.  But  a  great  part  of  Asia  toward %0a%3c the  North  hath  in  it  extensive  Wildernesses,  by  reason  of  the %0a%3c violence  of  its  frozen  Star.  From  the  extreme  North  to  the %0a%3c North-east  are  the  Scythians.  Beyond  whom,  and  the  very %0a%3c point  of  the  North  Pole,  some  have  placed  the  Hyperborei ; %0a%3c of  whom  we  have  spoken  at  large  in  the  Treatise  of  Europe. %0a%3c The  first  Promontory  that  you  meet  with  in  the  Country %0a%3c Celtica  is  named  Lytarmis :  and  then  the  River  Carambucis, %0a%3c where,  by  the  forcible  influence  of  the  Stars,  the  Mountains %0a%3c Rhiphaei  are  deprived  of  their  ragged  Tops.  And  there  we %0a%3c have  heard  that  there  are  a  People  named  Arimphaei:  a %0a%3c Nation  not  much  unlike  the  Hyperborei.  They  have  their %0a%3c Habitations  in  Forests  ;  their  Food  is  Berries  ;  both  Women %0a%3c and  Men  count  it  a  shame  to  have  Hair ;  mild  in  their  man- %0a%3c ners; and  therefore,  by  report,  they  are  held  to  be  sacred, %0a%3c and  to  be  inviolable  even  by  those  wild  People  that  dwell %0a%3c near  them  ;  neither  do  they  respect  them  only,  but  also  those %0a%3c who  fly  to  them.  At  some  distance  beyond  them  are  the %0a%3c Scythians,1  as  well  the  Cimmerii,  Cicianthi,  and  Georgi ; %0a%3c and  the  Nation  of  the  Amazons.  These  reach  to  the  Caspian %0a%3c and  Hircanian  Sea :  for  it  breaketh  forth  from  the  Scythian %0a%3c Ocean,2  toward  the  back  parts  of  Asia,  and  is  called  many %0a%3c Names  by  the  neighbouring  Inhabitants,  but  especially  by %0a%3c two  of  the  most  celebrated,  the  Caspian  and  Hircanian. %0a%3c Clitarchus  is  of  opinion  that  this  Sea  is  full  as  great  as  the %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  At  this  day,  the  Moschovites,  white  and  black  Russians,  Georgians, %0a%3c Amazonians,  and  the  less  Tartary. —  Wern.

That  both  these  intelligent  writers,  as  well  as  other %0a%3c ancient  geographers,  should  have  been  so  mistaken  is  the  more  extraor- %0a%3c dinary, as  Herodotus  (lib.  i.  203)  had  given  a  just  description  of  it  long %0a%3c before.

The  first  Gulf  is  called %0a%3c Scythicus ;  for  the  Scythians  inhabit  on  both  Sides,  and  by %0a%3c means  of  the  narrow  Straits  between  have  business  one  with %0a%3c another :  for  on  one  side  are  the  Nomades  and  Sauromatae, %0a%3c with  many  Names :  and  on  the  other,  the  Abzoae,  who  have %0a%3c no  fewer  denominations.  At  the  entry  of  this  Sea  on  the %0a%3c right  hand,  the  Udini,  a  People  of  the  Scythians,  dwell %0a%3c upon  the  very  point  of  these  Straits  :  and  then  along  the %0a%3c Coast,  the  Albani,  descended  (as  they  say)  from  Jason ; %0a%3c where  the  Sea  that  lieth  before  them  is  called  Albanum. %0a%3c This  Nation  is  spread  also  upon  the  Mountains  of  Caucasus %0a%3c to  the  River  Cyrus,  and  descendeth,  as  hath  been  said,  to  the %0a%3c border  of  Armenia  and  Iberia.  Above  the  Maritime  Coasts %0a%3c of  Albania  and  the  Nation  of  the  Udini,  the  Sarmatse,  called %0a%3c Utidorsi,  and  Atoderes,  are  planted  :  and  behind  them  the %0a%3c Sauromatides,  Amazons,  already  pointed  out.  The  Rivers  of %0a%3c Albania,  which  fall  into  the  Sea,  are  Cassios  and  Albanos : %0a%3c and  then  Carnbises,  which  hath  its  Head  in  the  Caucasian %0a%3c Mountains  :  and  soon  after  Cyrus,  which  ariseth  out  of  the %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BOOK  VI.]  History  of  Nature.  113 %0a%3c %0a%3c Mountains  Corax,  as  is  before  said.  Agrippa  writeth  that %0a%3c this  whole  Coast,  from  the  lofty  and  inaccessible  Mountains %0a%3c of  Caucasus,  containeth  425  Miles.  Beyond  the  Cyrus,  the %0a%3c Caspian  Sea  beginneth  to  take  that  Name ;  and  the  Caspii %0a%3c dwell  there.  And  here  the  error  of  many  is  to  be  corrected, %0a%3c even  of  those  who  were  lately  with  Corbulo  in  Armenia  with %0a%3c the  Army  :  for  they  called  those  Gates  of  Caucasus,  of  which %0a%3c we  spoke  before,  the  Caspian  Gates  of  Iberia :  and  the  Maps %0a%3c and  Descriptions  which  are  painted  and  sent  from  thence, %0a%3c have  that  Name  written  on  them.  Likewise  the  threatening %0a%3c of  Prince  JVero,  when  he  sought  to  gain  those  Gates,  which %0a%3c through  Iberia  lead  into  Sarmatia,  made  mention  of  the %0a%3c Gates  Caspise ;  which  had  scarcely  any  Passage  by  reason %0a%3c of  the  Mountains  so  closely  approaching  each  other.  There %0a%3c are  other  Gates  near  the  Caspian  Sea,  that  join  upon  the %0a%3c Caspian  Nations,  which  could  not  have  been  distinguished %0a%3c from  the  other  but  by  the  relation  of  those  that  accompanied %0a%3c Alexander  the  Great  in  his  Expeditions.  For  the  Kingdoms %0a%3c of  the  Persians,  which  at  this  day  we  take  to  be  those  of %0a%3c the  Parthians,  are  elevated  between  the  Persian  and  Hir- %0a%3c canian  Seas  upon  the  Mountains  of  Caucasus  ;  in  the  Descent %0a%3c of  which  on  both  sides  bordering  upon  Armenia  the  Greater, %0a%3c and  on  that  part  of  the  front  which  vergeth  to  Comagene,  it %0a%3c joineth  (as  we  have  said)  with  Sephenise :  and  upon  it  bor- %0a%3c dereth  Adiabene,  the  beginning  of  the  Assyrians  :  Arbelitis, %0a%3c which  is  nearest  to  Syria,  is  a  part  of  this:  where  Alexander %0a%3c vanquished  Darius.

The  other  Towns  of  the  Medes %0a%3c are  Phausia,  Agamzua,  and  Apamia,  named  also  Rhaphane. %0a%3c The  Straits  there,  (called  the  Caspian  Gates,)  have  the  same %0a%3c reason  for  being  so  named  as  the  other  (by  Caucasus) ;  be- %0a%3c cause the  Mountains  are  broken  through  with  so  narrow %0a%3c a  Passage,  that  hardly  a  single  line  of  Carts  is  able  to  pass %0a%3c it  for  the  Length  of  Eight  Miles  :  and  all  done  by  the  hand %0a%3c of  Man.  The  Cliffs  that  hang  over  on  the  right  Side  and  on %0a%3c the  left  are  as  if  they  were  scorched  :  through  a  silent  Tract %0a%3c of  38  Miles  ;  for  all  the  Moisture  running  together  out  of %0a%3c those  Cliffs,  and  pouring  through  the  Straits,  obstructs  the %0a%3c Passage.  Besides,  the  Multitude  of  Serpents  prevents  Tra- %0a%3c velling except  in  Winter. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  XV. %0a%3c Nations  about  the  Hircanian  Sea. %0a%3c %0a%3c UNTO  Adiabene  are  joined  the  Carduchi,  so  called  in %0a%3c Times  past,  and  now  Cordueni ;  along  which  the  Tigris %0a%3c runneth ;  and  on  them  the  Pratitse  border,  called  also  Pare- %0a%3c doni,  who  hold  the  Caspian  Gates.  On  the  other  side  of %0a%3c whom  you  meet  with  the  Deserts  of  Parthia,  and  the  Moun- %0a%3c tains of  Cithenus :  and  beyond  these  is  the  most  pleasant %0a%3c Tract  of  the  same  Parthia,  called  Choara.  There  stand  two %0a%3c Cities  of  the  Parthians,  formerly  opposed  against  the  Me- %0a%3c dians :  namely,  Calliope  ;  and  Issatis,  situated  in  times  past %0a%3c upon  another  Rock.  The  Capital  of  Parthia  itself,  lleca- %0a%3c tompylos,  is  from  the  (Caspian)  Gates  133  Miles.  Thus  the %0a%3c Kingdoms  of  the  Parthians  are  shut  up  by  Doors.  When %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BOOK  VI.]  History  of  Nature.  115 %0a%3c %0a%3c passed  out  of  these  Gates,  presently  we  enter  on  the  Cas- %0a%3c pian Nation,  which  reacheth  as  far  as  the  Sea-shore,  and %0a%3c gave  the  Name  to  the  Gates  and  the  Sea.  The  left  hand  is %0a%3c full  of  Mountains :  and  from  this  Nation  backward  to  the %0a%3c River  Cyrus,  is  by  report  220  Miles.  From  that  River,  if %0a%3c you  would  go  higher  up  to  the  Gates,  it  is  700  Miles.  And %0a%3c from  this  starting-place  began  Alexander  to  reckon  his %0a%3c Journeys :  making  from  those  Gates  to  the  Entrance  of %0a%3c India,  15,680  Stadia :  from  thence  to  the  Town  of  Bactra, %0a%3c which  they  call  Zariaspa,  3700,  and  thence  to  the  River %0a%3c Jaxartes  five  Miles. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  XVI. %0a%3c Other  Nations  also. %0a%3c %0a%3c FROM  the  Caspian  Country  eastward,  lieth  the  Region %0a%3c called  Zapanortene,1  and  in  it  Daricum,  a  place  celebrated %0a%3c for  Fertility.  Then  come  the  Nations  of  the  Tapyri,  Anariaci, %0a%3c Stauri,  and  Hircani,  at  whose  Coasts  the  same  Sea  beginneth %0a%3c to  take  the  Name  Hircanum,  from  the  River  Syderis.  About %0a%3c it  are  the  Rivers  Mazeras  and  Stratos,  all  issuing  out  of %0a%3c Caucasus.  Then  follows  the  Region  Margiana,  famous  for %0a%3c its  warm  Sunshine,  and  the  only  place  in  all  that  quarter %0a%3c which  yieldeth  Vines.  It  is  environed  with  pleasant  Moun- %0a%3c tains, for  the  compass  of  1500  Stadia:  difficult  of  approach %0a%3c by  reason  of  the  Sandy  Deserts  for  the  space  of  120  Miles; %0a%3c and  it  is  situated  over  against  the  Tract  of  Parthia,  wherein %0a%3c Alexander  had  built  Alexandria ;  which  being  destroyed  by %0a%3c the  Barbarians,  Antiochus  the  Son  ofSeleucus  rebuilt  it  in  the %0a%3c same  place,  upon  the  River  Margus,  which  runneth  through %0a%3c it,  together  with  another  River  Zotale,  and  it  was  called %0a%3c Syriana.2  But  he  desired  rather  that  it  should  be  named %0a%3c Antiochia.

The  Persians  called  them  in  general  Sacas,  from %0a%3c a  People  adjoining,  and  the  Ancients  Aramei.  The  Scythians %0a%3c for  their  part  called  the  Persians,  Chorsari :  and  the  Moun- %0a%3c tain Caucasus,  they  called  Graucasus,  that  is  to  say,  White %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BOOK  VI.]  History  of  Nature.  117 %0a%3c %0a%3c with  Snow.1  The  People  are  exceedingly  numerous  :  as %0a%3c much  so  as  the  Parthians.  The  principal  People  of  Scythia %0a%3c are  the  Sacse,  Massagetae,  Dahse,  Essedones,  Ariacae,  Rhym- %0a%3c nici,  Pesici,  Amordi,  Histi,  Edones,  Camee,  Camacse,  Eu- %0a%3c chatse,  Corieri,  Antariani,  Pialae,  Arirnaspi,  formerly  called %0a%3c Cacidiri,  Assei,  and  Oetei.  The  Napsei  and  Apellsei  who %0a%3c dwelt  there,  are  said  to  have  perished.  The  noble  Rivers  of %0a%3c those  People  are  Mandagrseus  and  Caspasius.  And  surely %0a%3c there  is  not  a  Region  wherein  Geographers  vary  as  they  do %0a%3c in  this :  and  I  believe  this  to  proceed  from  the  very  great %0a%3c number  of  those  Nations,  and  their  wandering  to  and  fro. %0a%3c Alexander  the  Great  reporteth  that  the  Water  of  the  Scy- %0a%3c thian Sea  is  fresh  and  potable ;  and  M.  Varro  saith  that %0a%3c Pompey  had  such  Water  brought  to  him  when  he  carried  on %0a%3c the  War  in  that  Neighbourhood  against  Mithridates:  by %0a%3c reason,  no  doubt,  of  the  great  Rivers  that  fall  into  it,  which %0a%3c overcome  the  Saltness  of  the  Water.  Varro  saith  also,  that %0a%3c during  this  Expedition  of  Pompey  to  the  Bactri  it  was  known %0a%3c that  it  is  but  seven  Days'  Journey  from  India  to  the  River %0a%3c Icarus,  which  runneth  into  the  Oxus :  and  that  the  Mer- %0a%3c chandise of  India,  transported  by  the  Caspian  Sea,  and  so %0a%3c to  the  River  Cyrus,  may  be  brought  in  not  more  than  five %0a%3c Days  by  Land  as  far  as  to  Phasis  in  Pontus.  Many  Islands %0a%3c lie  all  over  that  Sea  :  but  one  above  the  rest  is  Tazata ;  for %0a%3c thither  all  the  Shipping  from  the  Caspian  Sea  and  the  Scy- %0a%3c thian Ocean  bend  their  Course,  the  Sea-coasts  being  all %0a%3c turned  to  the  East.  The  first  part  of  this  is  uninhabitable, %0a%3c from  the  Scythian  Promontory,  by  reason  of  the  Snow  :  and %0a%3c the  next  Regions  to  this  are  left  uncultivated  because  of  the %0a%3c Fierceness  of  those  Nations  that  border  upon  it.  The  An- %0a%3c thropophagi are  in  Scythia,  who  live  on  Man's  flesh.2  This %0a%3c is  the  cause  why  there  are  nothing  there  but  vast  Deserts, %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  The  Emodus  or  Imaus  of  Pliny  (a  word  which  in  the  language  of %0a%3c the  inhabitants  signifies  snowy,)  derived  its  origin  immediately  from  the %0a%3c Ilimaleh  of  the  Hindoos ;  which  really  signifies  in  their  language  "  snowy," %0a%3c or  more  strictly  speaking,  "the  seat  of  snow." — Quarterly  Review^  vol.  xxiv. %0a%3c p.  103. —  Wern.

Almost  one-half %0a%3c of  the  length  of  that  Coast,  which  looketh  toward  the  East, %0a%3c is  uninhabited.  The  first  of  the  People  that  are  known  are %0a%3c the  Seres,1  famous  for  the  fine  Silk  that  their  Woods  yield. %0a%3c They  collect  from  the  Leaves  of  the  Trees  their  hoary  Down, %0a%3c and  when  it  is  steeped  in  Water  they  card  it;  wherein  our %0a%3c Women  have  a  double  Labour,  both  of  undoing  and  again  of %0a%3c weaving  this  kind  of  Thread :  with  so  much  Labour  and  so %0a%3c far  away  is  it  sought  after,  that  our  Matrons  when  they  go %0a%3c abroad  in  the  street  may  shine  with  Transparency.  The %0a%3c Seres  are  a  mild  People,  but  they  resemble  Beasts,  in  that  they %0a%3c fly  the  Company  of  other  People2  when  they  desire  inter- %0a%3c %0a%3c the  Samoieds,  in  the  north  of  Russia :  their  name  signifying  people  who %0a%3c eat  each  other ;  but  the  word  has  long  survived  the  practice  it  described. %0a%3c Ovid  speaks  of  such  a  people  seated  near  the  place  of  his  exile  on  the %0a%3c Euxine : %0a%3c %0a%3c "  UK  quos  audis  hominum  gaudere  cruore." %0a%3c %0a%3c TRIST.  1.  4.,  explained  by  AGELL.  ix.  4. — Wern.

It  was  a  pardon- %0a%3c able error  to  suppose  that  silk  was  the  produce  of  a  tree,  instead  of  being %0a%3c the  production  of  a  creature  which  fed  on  it ;  but  it  appears  that  the %0a%3c Romans  were  at  great  pains  in  disentangling  the  woven  texture,  that %0a%3c it  might  again  be  formed  into  garments  which  better  suited  their  taste %0a%3c or  habits.     Martial  speaks  of  this  material  under  the  name  of  Bombycina %0a%3c (Apophoreta,  24),  and  from  his  account  it  was  of  very  fine  texture,  and %0a%3c probably  expensive.     When  it  was  worn,  the  hair  was  bound  up  into  a %0a%3c knot  and  fastened  with  a  gold  pin,  in  order  that  it  might  not  soil  so %0a%3c exquisite  a  dress.

Of  this %0a%3c People,  Amonetus  hath  specially  written  a  Book  ;  as  Hera- %0a%3c taus  hath  done  of  the  Hyperboreans.  Beyond  the  Attacores %0a%3c are  the  Thyri  and  Tochari,  and  then  the  Casiri,  who  now %0a%3c belong  to  the  Indians.  But  they  withinland,  that  lie  toward %0a%3c the  Scythians,  feed  on  Man's  Flesh.  The  Nomades  of %0a%3c India  likewise  wander  to  and  fro.

And  this  part  opposite  the  East,  stretcheth %0a%3c straightforward  to  that  place  where  it  beginneth  to  bend %0a%3c toward  the  Indian  Sea;  and  it  containeth  1875  Miles. %0a%3c Then  that  Tract  which  is  bent  towards  the  South  taketh %0a%3c 2475  Miles  (as  Eratosthenes  hath  set  down),  even  to  the %0a%3c River  Indus,  which  is  the  utmost  limit  of  India  Westward. %0a%3c But  many  others  have  set  down  the  whole  Length  of  India %0a%3c in  this  manner ;  that  it  requireth  40  Days  and  Nights'  Sail- %0a%3c ing ;  and  also,  that  from  the  North  to  the  South  is  2750 %0a%3c Miles.  Agrippa  saith  that  it  is  3003  Miles  Long,  and %0a%3c 2003  Broad.  Posidonius  hath  measured  it  from  the  North- %0a%3c east to  the  South-east ;  and  by  this  means  fixeth  it  directly %0a%3c opposite  to  Gaul,  which  he  likewise  measured  along  the %0a%3c West  Coast,  from  the  North-west  point  where  the  Sun  goeth %0a%3c down  at  Midsummer,  to  the  South-west,  where  it  setteth %0a%3c in  the  midst  of  Winter.  He  teacheth  also,  by  very  good %0a%3c Reasons,  that  this  West  Wind,  which  from  opposite  bloweth %0a%3c upon  India,  is  very  healthful  for  that  Country.  The  Indians %0a%3c have  a  different  Aspect  of  the  Sky  from  us.  Other  Stars  rise %0a%3c in  their  Hemisphere.  They  have  two  Summers  in  the  Year ; %0a%3c two  Harvests :  and  their  Winter  between  hath  the  Etesian %0a%3c Winds  blowing  instead  of  the  Northern  Blasts  with  us.

[BooK  VI. %0a%3c %0a%3c Winds  are  mild  with  them,  the  Sea  navigable,  the  Nations %0a%3c and  the  Cities  innumerable,  if  any  one  would  take  in  Hand %0a%3c to  reckon  them  all.  For  India  hath  been  discovered,  not %0a%3c only  by  the  Arms  of  Alexander  the  Great,  and  of  other %0a%3c Kings  his  Successors  (for  Seleucus  and  Antiochus,  and  their %0a%3c Admiral  Patrocles,  sailed  about  it,  even  to  the  Hircan  and %0a%3c Caspian  Seas) :  but  also  other  Greek  Authors,  who  abode %0a%3c with  the  Kings  of  India  (as  Megasthenes,  and  Dionysius,  who %0a%3c was  sent  thither  for  this  purpose  by  Plriladelphus)  have %0a%3c made  relation  of  the  Forces  of  those  Nations.  And  further %0a%3c Diligence  is  to  be  employed,  considering  they  wrote  of %0a%3c Things  so  various  and  incredible.  They  who  accompanied %0a%3c Alexander  the  Great  in  his  Indian  Voyage  have  written, %0a%3c that  in  that  Quarter  of  India  which  he  conquered,  there %0a%3c were  5000  Towns,  not  one  of  them  less  than  (the  City)  Cos : %0a%3c and  -nine  Nations.  Also  that  India  is  a  third  Part  of  the %0a%3c whole  Earth  r1  that  the  People  in  it  were  innumerable.  And %0a%3c this  they  delivered  with  good  Appearance  of  Reason  :  for  the %0a%3c Indians  were  almost  the  only  Men  of  all  others  that  never %0a%3c went  out  of  their  own  Country.  They  collect  that  from  the %0a%3c Time  of  Father  Liber  to  Alexander  the  Great,  there  reigned %0a%3c over  them  154  Kings,  for  the  Space  of  5402  Years  and  three %0a%3c Months.  The  Rivers  are  of  wonderful  bigness.  It  is  reported %0a%3c that  Alexander  sailed  every  Day  at  least  600  Stadia  upon  the %0a%3c River  Indus,  and  yet  it  took  him  five  Months  and  some  few %0a%3c Days  to  reach  the  end  of  that  River,  although  it  is  allowed  to %0a%3c be  less  than  the  Ganges.  Also,  Seneca,  one  of  ourselves,  who %0a%3c laboured  to  write  Commentaries  on  India,  hath  made  Report %0a%3c of  60  Rivers  therein,  and  of  Nations,  118.  It  would  be  as %0a%3c great  a  Labour  to  reckon  up  the  Mountains.

But  to  shew  the  Continent,  we  will  follow  the  Steps %0a%3c of  Alexander  the  Great.  Dwgnetus  and  J3eton,  the  Mea- %0a%3c surers of  the  Journeys  of  that  Prince,  have  written,  that  from %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  "India,  a  third  part  of  the  whole  earth;"  which  is  near  the  truth, %0a%3c although  it  contradicts  what  Pliny  says  in  the  33d  chapter  of  this  Book. %0a%3c —  Wern.

Some  apply  themselves  to %0a%3c Tillage :  others  are  devoted  to  War :  one  Sort  export  their %0a%3c %0a%3c several  separate  people  are  so  denominated.  They  are  probably  the  same %0a%3c as  those  mentioned  in  the  19th  chapter,  as  being  always  prepared  for  a %0a%3c yoluntary  death.  —  Wern.

Those  that  are  the  richest  and %0a%3c most  worthy  manage  the  affairs  of  the  State,  distribute  Jus- %0a%3c tice, or  sit  in  Council  with  the  Kings.  A  fifth  Kind  there  is %0a%3c besides,  in  great  repute,  and  given  wholly  to  the  Study  of %0a%3c Wisdom  and  Religion ;  and  these  make  profession  of  being %0a%3c always  ready  for  a  voluntary  Death :  and  they  end  their %0a%3c Days  on  a  great  funeral  Fire,  which  they  have  prepared %0a%3c beforehand.  Besides  all  these,  one  Thing  there  is  amongst %0a%3c them  half  Savage,  and  full  of  exceeding  Toil,  and  yet  by %0a%3c which  all  the  Estates  abovesaid  are  maintained  ;  which  is  the %0a%3c practice  of  bunting  and  taming  Elephants.  It  is  with  them %0a%3c they  plough  their  Ground,  upon  them  they  ride :  these  are %0a%3c the  best  Cattle  they  know :  with  them  they  go  to  War,  and %0a%3c contend  in  defence  of  their  Frontiers.  In  the  choice  of  them %0a%3c for  War  they  consider  their  Strength,  their  Age,  and  Bigness %0a%3c of  Body.  There  is  an  Island  in  the  Ganges  of  great  size, %0a%3c containing  one  Nation,  named  Modogalica.  Beyond  it  are %0a%3c seated  the  Modubse,  Molindse,  where  standeth  the  fruitful %0a%3c and  stately  City  Molinda ;  the  Galmodroesi,  Preti,  Calissae, %0a%3c Sasuri,  Fassalpe,  Colubse,  Orxula3,  Abali,  and  Taluctse.  The %0a%3c King  of  these  Countries  hath  in  Arms  50,000  Foot,  3000 %0a%3c Horsemen,  arid  400  Elephants.  Then  comes  the  stronger %0a%3c Nation  of  the  Andarae,  with  many  Villages,  and  with  30 %0a%3c Towns,  fortified  with  Walls  and  Towers.  These  maintain %0a%3c ready  to  serve  the  King  100,000  Foot,  2000  Horsemen, %0a%3c and  1000  Elephants.  The  Dardae  are  the  richest  in  Gold; %0a%3c and  the  Setae,  in  Silver.  But  above  all  the  Nations  of  India %0a%3c throughout,  and  not  of  this  Tract  only,  the  Prasii  far  exceed %0a%3c in  Power  and  Reputation ;  and  the  largest  and  richest  City, %0a%3c Palibotra,  from  whence  some  have  named  this  Nation,  yea, %0a%3c and  all  the  Country  generally  beyond  Ganges,  Palibotros. %0a%3c Their  King  keepeth  continually  in  pay  600,000  Footmen, %0a%3c 30,000  Horsemen,  and  9000  Elephants,  every  Day.  Whereby %0a%3c you  may  guess  the  mighty  Wealth  of  this  Prince.  Beyond, %0a%3c more  within,  inhabit  the  Monedes  and  Suari,  who  possess %0a%3c the  Mountain  Maleus  :  in  which,  for  six  Months,  the  Sha- %0a%3c dows in  Winter  fall  northward  ;  and  in  Summer,  south- %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 124  History  of  Nature.

The  South  Pole  is  called  by  the  Indians %0a%3c Dramasa.  The  River  Jomanes  runneth  into  the  Ganges %0a%3c through  Palibotros,  between  the  Towns  Methora  and  Cyriso- %0a%3c borca.  Beyond  the  River  Ganges,  in  that  quarter  which  lieth %0a%3c southward,  the  People  are  coloured  by  the  Sun :  but  though %0a%3c tinted,  yet  not  so  burnt  as  the  Ethiopians.  And  the  nearer  they %0a%3c approach  to  the  Indus,  the  deeper  coloured  they  are  with  the %0a%3c Sun :  for  closely  beyond  the  Nation  of  the  Prasii  is  the  In- %0a%3c dus :  among  whose  Mountains  the  Pigmrei  are  reported  to %0a%3c inhabit.

Among  these  the  principal %0a%3c are  Hydaspes,  which  bringeth  with  it  four  more :  and  Can- %0a%3c tabra,  conveying  three.  Moreover,  of  such  as  are  of  them- %0a%3c selves navigable,  Acesines  and  Hypasis :  and  yet  so  modest %0a%3c is  the  Course  of  its  Waters,  that  in  no  place  is  it  either  above %0a%3c 50  Stadia  over,  or  deeper  than  15  Paces.2  This  River %0a%3c encloseth  a  very  great  Island  named  Prasiane,  and  another %0a%3c that  is  less,  which  they  call  Patale.  They  that  have  written %0a%3c it  with  the  least,  say  that  it  is  navigable  for  1240  Miles ; %0a%3c and  turning  with  the  Course  of  the  Sun,  it  keepeth  him  com- %0a%3c pany westward,  until  it  is  discharged  into  the  Ocean.

From  the  Mouth  of  the  Ganges  to  the  Cape %0a%3c Calingon,  and  the  Town  Dandagula,  are  725  Miles  :  from %0a%3c thence  to  Tropina,  1225  Miles.  Then  to  the  Promontory  of %0a%3c Perimula,  where  is  the  chief  Town  of  Merchandise  in  all %0a%3c India,  750  Miles:  from  which  to  the  abovesaid  Town  Patale, %0a%3c within  the  Island,  620  Miles.  The  Mountain  Nations  be- %0a%3c tween it  and  Jomanes  are  the  Cesi  and  the  savage  Catreboni : %0a%3c next  to  them  the  Megallae,  whose  King  hath  500  Elephants ; %0a%3c and  of  Foot  and  Horsemen  an  uncertain  number.  The %0a%3c Chrysei,  Parasangze,  and  Asangae,  are  full  of  Tigers:  they %0a%3c arm  30,000  Foot,  800  Horsemen,  and  300  Elephants.  The %0a%3c Indus  shuts  them  in,  and  they  are  enclosed  with  a  crown  of %0a%3c Mountains  and  Wildernesses  for  (525  Miles.  Beneath  these %0a%3c Deserts  are  the  Dari  and  Surge ;  and  then  again  Deserts  for %0a%3c 188  Miles,  compassed  about  for  the  most  part  with  Banks  of %0a%3c Sands,  like  Islands  in  the  Sea.  Under  these  Deserts  are  the %0a%3c Maltecorae,  Singae,  Marobae,  Rarungee,  Moruntes,  Masuae, %0a%3c and  Pagungae.  Now  for  those  who  inhabit  the  Mountains, %0a%3c which  in  a  continual  range  without  interruption  stand  upon %0a%3c the  Coasts  of  the  Ocean,  they  are  free  and  subject  to  no %0a%3c Kings,  and  many  Cities  they  hold  among  these  Mountains. %0a%3c Then  come  the  Naraese,  enclosed  within  the  highest  Mountain %0a%3c of  all  the  Indian  Hills,  Capitalia.  On  the  other  side  of  this %0a%3c the  Inhabitants  dig  extensively  in  Gold  and  Silver  Mines. %0a%3c Then  you  enter  upon  Oratura,  whose  King  hath  indeed  but %0a%3c 10  Elephants,  but  a  great  abundance  of  Footmen;  and  the %0a%3c Varetatae,  who  under  their  King  keep  no  Elephants,  trusting %0a%3c to  their  Horsemen  and  Footmen.

Another  Town %0a%3c there  is  among  them,  of  great  Name :  Automela,  standing %0a%3c on  the  Sea-side  :  a  noble  resort  of  Merchants,  by  reason  of %0a%3c five  great  Rivers  which  meet  all  there  in  one  confluence. %0a%3c Their  King  possesseth  1600  Elephants,  150,000  Footmen, %0a%3c and  5000  Horsemen.  The  King  of  the  Charmse  is  poor ;  he %0a%3c possesseth  60  Elephants,  and  his  Power  is  otherwise  small. %0a%3c Beyond  them  are  the  Pandse,  the  only  Nation  of  the  Indians %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 126  History  of  Nature.

Beyond %0a%3c them,  the  Uri  and  Sileni ;  and  then  Deserts  for  250  Miles  ; %0a%3c which  being  passed  over,  there  are  the  Organages,  the %0a%3c Abaortae,  Sibarae,  and  the  Suertae  :  and  beyond  these  a  Wil- %0a%3c derness as  great  as  the  former.  Again,  the  Sarophages, %0a%3c Sorgae,  Baraomatae,  and  the  Gumbritae;  of  whom  there  are %0a%3c thirteen  Nations,  and  each  one  hath  two  Cities.  The  Aseni %0a%3c inhabit  three  Cities :  their  capital  City  is  Bucephala,  built  in %0a%3c the  very  Place  where  King  Alexander  s  horse,  called  Buce- %0a%3c phalus, was  buried.  Above  them  are  the  Mountaineers %0a%3c below  the  Caucacus,  named  Soleadae  and  Sondrae :  and  hav- %0a%3c ing passed  the  Indus,  going  along  its  Banks  are  the  Sama- %0a%3c rabriae,  the  Sambruceni,  the  Brisabritae,  Osii,  Antixeni,  and %0a%3c Taxillae,  with  a  famous  City  called  Amandra :  from  which  all %0a%3c that  Tract  now  lying  plain  within  the  Country  is  named %0a%3c Amandra.  Four  Nations  there  are :  the  Peucolaitae,  Arsa- %0a%3c galitae,  Geretae,  and  Asoi :  for  many  set  not  down  the  River %0a%3c Indus  as  the  limit  westward ;  but  add  four  Provinces %0a%3c (Satrapae):  Gedrosi,  Arachotae,  Arii,  and  Paropamisadae. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  XXI. %0a%3c Tlit  Arii  and  the  Nations  adjoining* %0a%3c %0a%3c OTHER  Writers  prefer  the  opinion,  that  the  utmost  limit %0a%3c is  the  River  Cophetes,  all  which  quarters  are  within  the  Ter- %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  Babul. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BOOK  VI.]  History  of  Nature.  127 %0a%3c %0a%3c ritory  of  the  Arii :  and  most  of  them  affirm  that  the  City %0a%3c Nysa,  as  also  the  Mountain  Merus  consecrated  to  Father %0a%3c Liber,  belong  to  India.  This  is  that  Mountain  from  which %0a%3c arose  the  Fable,  that  he  sprung  from  the  Seed  of  Jupiter. %0a%3c Likewise  (they  assign  to  India)  the  Country  of  the  Aspagonse, %0a%3c so  plentiful  in  Vines,  Laurels,  and  Box,  and  generally  all %0a%3c sorts  of  Fruits  that  grow  in  Greece.  Many  wonderful,  and %0a%3c in  a  manner  fabulous  things,  they  report  of  the  Fertility  of %0a%3c that  Land,  of  the  sorts  of  Fruits,  of  Trees  bearing  Cotton,  of %0a%3c Wild  Beasts,  of  Birds,  and  other  Creatures :  which  I  will %0a%3c reserve  for  their  proper  places  in  another  part  of  this  Work. %0a%3c Those  four  Satrapies,  which  I  mentioned  before,  I  will  speak %0a%3c of  presently:  for  now  I  hasten  to  the  Island  Taprobane. %0a%3c But  there  are  other  Isles  first,  as  Patalse,  which  we  have %0a%3c noted  to  lie  in  the  very  Mouth  of  the  River  Indus,  of  a %0a%3c Triangular  figure,  220  Miles  in  Breadth.  Without  the %0a%3c Mouth  of  the  Indus,  two  other  Islands,  Chryse  and  Agyre, %0a%3c abounding,  as  I  suppose,  in  Gold  and  Silver  Mines ;  for  I %0a%3c cannot  easily  believe,  that  the  Soil  there  is  all  Gold  and %0a%3c Silver,  as  some  have  reported.  Twenty  Miles  from  them  is %0a%3c Crocala:  and  twelve  Miles  further  Bibaga,  abundant  in %0a%3c Oysters  and  other  Shell-fishes.  Then,  nine  Miles  beyond %0a%3c it,  Toralliba  sheweth  itself,  and  many  other  petty  Islands. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  XXII. %0a%3c The  Island  Taprobant.1 %0a%3c %0a%3c IT  hath  been  for  a  long  time  thought  that  Taprobane  was %0a%3c another  World  under  the  appellation  of  the  Antichthones. %0a%3c But  from  the  time  of  Alexander  the  Great,  and  the  inter- %0a%3c course in  those  parts,  it  was  discovered  to  be  an  Island. %0a%3c Oneslcratusj  the  Admiral  of  his  Fleet,  hath  written,  that  the %0a%3c Elephants  bred  in  this  Island  are  bigger  and  better  fitted  for %0a%3c War  than  those  of  India.  Megasthenes  saith,  that  there  is %0a%3c a  River  which  divideth  it,  arid  that  the  Inhabitants  are  called %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  This  is  now  generally  concluded  to  be  the  island  of  Ceylon,  in  the %0a%3c East  Indies,  now  subject  to  British  dominion. —  Wern.

Eratosthenes  also  took  the  Measure %0a%3c of  it,  in  length  7000  Stadia,  and  in  breadth  5000  :  that %0a%3c there  are  no  Cities,  but  Villages  to  the  number  of  700.  It %0a%3c beginneth  at  the  Sea  Eoos,  from  which  it  extendeth %0a%3c between  the  East  and  West  of  India :  and  in  times %0a%3c past  was  believed  to  lie  out  into  the  Sea  from  the  Prasian %0a%3c Nation  twenty  Days'  Sailing.  But  afterwards,  because  the %0a%3c Vessels  and  Rigging  used  upon  this  Sea  in  the  Passage %0a%3c thither  were  made  of  Paper  Reeds,  like  those  of  the  River %0a%3c Nile,  the  Voyage  was  estimated,  by  comparison  with  our %0a%3c Ships,  at  about  seven  Days.  All  the  Sea  tying  between %0a%3c is  full  of  Shallows,  no  more  than  five  Fathoms  Deep  ;  but  in %0a%3c certain  Channels  it  is  so  deep  that  no  Anchors  will  reach  the %0a%3c Bottom:  and  so  narrow  are  these  Channels,  that  a  Ship %0a%3c cannot  turn  within  them ;  and  therefore,  to  avoid  the  neces- %0a%3c sity of  turning,  the  Ships  have  Prows  at  both  ends.  In %0a%3c Sailing,  there  is  no  Observation  of  the  Stars.  The  North %0a%3c Pole  is  never  seen  :  but  they  carry  with  them  Birds,  which %0a%3c they  send  off  at  intervals  and  follow  their  Course,  as  they %0a%3c fly  to  Land :  neither  used  they  go  to  Sea  for  more  than %0a%3c three  Months  in  the  Year  ;  and  for  one  hundred  Days  from %0a%3c the  Solstice  they  take  most  heed ;  for  at  that  time  it  is  Win- %0a%3c ter with  them.  And  thus  much  we  know  by  relation  of %0a%3c ancient  Writers.  But  we  obtain  better  Intelligence,  and %0a%3c more  accurate  Information,  by  Ambassadors  who  came  out %0a%3c of  that  Island,  in  the  reign  of  Claudius,  which  happened %0a%3c after  this  manner.  A  Freed-man  of  Annius  Plocamus,  who %0a%3c had  Farmed  from  the  Exchequer  the  Customs  of  the  Red %0a%3c Sea,  as  he  sailed  about  the  Coasts  of  Arabia,  was  driven  with %0a%3c the  North  Winds  beyond  the  Realm  of  Carmania,  and  in  the %0a%3c Space  of  15  Days  he  reached  an  Harbour  of  that  Country, %0a%3c called  Hippuros.  He  found  the  King  of  that  Country  so %0a%3c courteous,  as  to  afford  him  Entertainment  for  six  Months. %0a%3c And  as  he  used  to  discourse  with  him  about  the  Romans  and %0a%3c Caesar,  he  recounted  to  him  at  large  of  all  things.  But %0a%3c among  many  other  Reports  that  he  heard,  he  wondered  most %0a%3c at  their  Justice,  because  their  Denarii  of  the  Money  which %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BOOK  V  [ .]  History  of  Nature.  ]  29 %0a%3c %0a%3c was  taken  were  always  of  the  same  Weight,  although  the %0a%3c different  Images  shewed  that  they  were  made  by  different %0a%3c Persons.  And  hereupon  especially  was  he  moved  to  seek %0a%3c for  the  Friendship  of  Rome  ;  and  so  despatched  four  Ambas- %0a%3c sadors, of  whom  Rachias  was  the  chief.  From  them  it  be- %0a%3c came known  that  there  were  five  hundred  Towns  in  it ;  and %0a%3c that  there  was  a  Harbour  facing  the  South,  lying  conve- %0a%3c niently near  the  Town  Palesimundum,  the  principal  City  of %0a%3c all  that  Realm,  and  the  King's  Seat ;  that  there  were %0a%3c 200,000  common  Citizens  :  that  within  this  Island  there  was %0a%3c a  Lake  called  Magisba,  270  Miles  in  Circuit,  containing  in %0a%3c it  some  Islands  fruitful  in  nothing  but  Pasturage.  Out  of %0a%3c this  Lake  issued  two  Rivers ;  the  one,  Palesimundas,  pass- %0a%3c ing near  to  the  City  of  the  same  Name,  and  running  into  the %0a%3c Harbour  with  three  Streams ;  of  which  the  Narrowest  was  five %0a%3c Stadia  Broad,  and  the  largest  fifteen  ;  the  other  Northward %0a%3c towards  India,  by  Name  Cydara :  also  that  the  next  Cape  of %0a%3c this  Country  to  India  is  called  Colaicum,  from  which  to  the %0a%3c nearest  Port  (of  India)  is  counted  four  Days'  Sailing  :  in  the %0a%3c midst  of  which  Passage,  there  lieth  the  Island  of  the  Sun. %0a%3c They  said,  moreover,  that  the  Water  of  this  Sea  was  of  a %0a%3c deep  green  Colour;  and,  what  is  still  more  extraordinary, %0a%3c full  of  Trees  growing  within  it  :1  so  that  the  Pilots  with %0a%3c their  Helms  broke  off  the"  Crests  of  those  Trees.  They  won- %0a%3c dered to  see  the  Stars  about  the  North  Pole  (Septentriones) %0a%3c and  Vergiliae,  as  if  it  had  been  a  new  Heaven.  They  confessed %0a%3c also  they  never  saw,  with  them,  the  Moon  above  the  Earth %0a%3c before  it  was  eight  Days  old,2  nor  after  the  sixteenth  Day. %0a%3c That  the  Canopus,  a  great  and  bright  Star,  used  to  shine  all %0a%3c Night  with  them.  But  the  thing  that  they  were  most  sur- %0a%3c prised at  was,  that  they  observed  the  Shadow  of  their  own %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  Branched  corals,  beyond  a  doubt. —  Wern.  Club. %0a%3c %0a%3c 2  It  is  surprising  to  find  an  author  so  intelligent  as  Pliny  relating %0a%3c such  extraordinary  circumstances    as  these   ambassadors   from  Ceylon %0a%3c reported  without  any  animadversion ;  and  particularly  that  he  takes  no %0a%3c notice  of  what  they  said  concerning  the  appearance  of  the  moon,  as  such %0a%3c a  phenomenon  could  not  take  place  in  any  region  of  the  earth.—  Wern. %0a%3c Club. %0a%3c %0a%3c VOL.

Furthermore  they  related, %0a%3c that  the  Front  of  that  Island  which  looked  toward  India %0a%3c contained  10,000  Stadia,  and  reached  from  the  South-east %0a%3c beyond  the  Mountains  Emodi.  Also,  that  the  Seres  were %0a%3c within  their  Sight,  with  whom  they  had  Acquaintance  by %0a%3c Merchandise :  and  that  the  Father  of  Rachias  used  many %0a%3c times  to  travel  thither:  affirming,  moreover,  that  if  any %0a%3c Strangers  came  thither,  they  were  assailed  by  Wild  Beasts  : %0a%3c and  that  the  Inhabitants  themselves  exceeded  the  ordinary %0a%3c Stature  of  Men,  having  red  Hair,  blue  Eyes,  their  Voice %0a%3c harsh,  their  Speech  not  fitted  for  any  Commerce.  In  all %0a%3c things  else  their  Practice  is  the  same  as  that  of  our  Mer- %0a%3c chants.

But  even  this  Island  Taprobane, %0a%3c seeming,  as  it  were,  to  be  separated  by  Nature  from  all  the %0a%3c World,  is  not  without  the  Vices  with  which  we  are  tainted. %0a%3c For  Gold  and  Silver  are  even  there  also  highly  esteemed : %0a%3c and  Marble,  especially  if  it  be  fashioned  like  a  Tortoise-shell. %0a%3c Gems  and  Pearls  also,  of  the  better  sort,  are  in  great  honour : %0a%3c and  the  Abundance  of  our  Luxury.  These  Ambassadors  said %0a%3c that  their  Riches  were  greater,  but  that  we  had  more  use  of %0a%3c them.  They  affirmed,  that  no  Man  with  them  had  any %0a%3c Slaves  ;  neither  slept  they  after  Day-light,  nor  in  the  Day- %0a%3c time :  that  the  Manner  of  Building  their  Houses  is  low,  that %0a%3c the  Price  of  Victuals  did  not  fluctuate ;  and  there  were  no %0a%3c Courts,  or  going  to  Law.

But %0a%3c before  we  treat  distinctly  of  these  Countries,  I  think  it  meet %0a%3c to  set  down  what  Onesicritus  (who  having  the  conduct  of  the %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  Fish  was  a  favourite  diet,  among  the  people  bordering  on  the %0a%3c Mediterranean  Sea \  and  therefore- the  objection  of  Alexander  could  not %0a%3c be  to  this,  simply  as  an  article  of  food.

To  remove  such  barriers  to  civilis- %0a%3c ation may  be  supposed  to  have  been  the  prevailing  motive  with  Alex- %0a%3c ander in  this  edict ;  which  regulated  rather  than  forbade  the  use  of  a %0a%3c wholesome  article  of  food. —  Wern.

Yet  these %0a%3c Particulars  are  by  them  reported  worthy  the  Remembrance  : %0a%3c as  that  in  this  Voyage  Nearchus  founded  a  Town :  that %0a%3c the  River  Nabrus  is  able  to  bear  great  Vessels :  overagainst %0a%3c which  there  is  an  Island,  at  the  Distance  of  70  Stadia  : %0a%3c that  Leonatus  founded  Alexandria  in  the  Frontiers  of %0a%3c that  Nation,  by  Commandment  of  Alexander  ;  Argenus  is  a %0a%3c safe  Harbour:  that  the  River  Tuberum  is  navigable,  around %0a%3c which  are  the  Paritse.

And  here  first  they  observed  that  they  had %0a%3c a  sight  of  the  North-pole  Star  (Septentriones).  The  Star %0a%3c Arcturus  they  saw  not  every  Night,  nor  at  any  Time  all %0a%3c Night  long.  Furthermore,  the  Archaemenides  reached  thus %0a%3c far :  and  they  found  Mines  of  Copper,  Iron,  Arsenic,  and  Ver- %0a%3c milion :  then  is  the  Cape  of  Carmania  :  from  which  to  the %0a%3c Coast  overagainst  them  of  the  Macae,  a  Nation  of  Arabia,  is %0a%3c 50  Miles.

And  thus  much  con- %0a%3c cerning the  Voyage  of  Alexanders  Fleet.  Afterwards %0a%3c from  Syagrus,  a  Promontory  in  Arabia,  it  was  counted  to %0a%3c Patale  1332  Miles,  and  that  the  West  Wind,  which  the %0a%3c people  of  that  Country  call  Hypalus,  was  thought  most  pro- %0a%3c per to  sail  with  to  the  same  Place.  The  Age  ensuing  dis- %0a%3c covered a  shorter  and  safer  Course  ;  namely,  if  from  the  said %0a%3c Promontory  they  set  their  Course  directly  to  the  River  Zize- %0a%3c rus,  an  Harbour  in  India.  And  in  truth  this  Passage  was %0a%3c sailed  for  a  long  time,  until  at  length  a  Merchant  found  out %0a%3c a  more  compendious  Course,  and  India  was  brought  near %0a%3c for  Gain :  for  every  Year  they  sailed  thither,  and  because %0a%3c Pirates  very  much  infest  them,  they  embark  in  their  Ships %0a%3c Companies  of  Archers.  And  because  all  these  Seas  are  now- %0a%3c first  certainly  discovered,  it  is  not  amiss  to  shew  the  whole %0a%3c Course  from  Egypt.  It  is  worthy  to  be  observed,  that  there %0a%3c is  not  a  Year  but  it  costs  our  State  to  furnish  into  India, %0a%3c 500,000  Sesterces,  (fifty  millions  of  Sesterces.)  For  which %0a%3c the  Indians  send  back  Merchandise,  which  at  Rome  is %0a%3c sold  for  a  hundred  times  as  much  as  it  cost.  From  Alex- %0a%3c andria it  is  two  Miles  to  Juliopolis  :  from  whence  on  the %0a%3c Nilus  they  sail  303  Miles  to  Coptus,  which  may  be  done  in %0a%3c twelve  Days,  with  the  Etesian  Winds  blowing.  From  Cop- %0a%3c tus they  travel  upon  Camels  ;  and  for  the  sake  of  Water %0a%3c there  are  Places  appointed  for  Lodging.

Again,  in  a %0a%3c Hill.  And  then  to  Hydreuma  the  New,  from  Coptus,  234 %0a%3c Miles.1  There  is  another  called  Hydreuma  the  Old,  named %0a%3c also  Troglodyticum,  where,  two  Miles  out  of  the  direct  way,  is %0a%3c a  Garrison,  four  Miles  distant  from  New  Hydreuma.  From %0a%3c thence  to  the  Town  Berenice,  where  is  an  Harbour  of  the %0a%3c Red  Sea,  258  Miles  from  Coptus.  But  as  the  Journey  is  for %0a%3c the  most  part  performed  by  Night,  because  of  the  excessive %0a%3c Heat,  and  Travellers  rest  all  the  Day,  twelve  Days  are  set %0a%3c down  for  the  whole  Journey  between  Coptus  and  Berenices %0a%3c They  begin  to  sail  at  Midsummer,  before  or  close  upon  the %0a%3c rising  of  the  Dog-star ;  and  in  about  30  Days  they  arrive  at %0a%3c Ocelis  in  Arabia,  or  else  at  Cana,  within  the  Country  of  In- %0a%3c cense. A  third  Port  there  is  besides,  called  Muza,  to  which %0a%3c there  is  no  Resort  of  the  Merchants  of  India  :  neither  by  any %0a%3c but  Merchants  that  traffic  in  Incense  and  Spices  of  Arabia. %0a%3c The  Indus  hath  Towns.2  Its  Region  is  called  Saphar :  and %0a%3c another  called  Sabe.  But  for  them  that  would  make  a %0a%3c Journey  to  the  Indians,  the  most  commodious  place  from %0a%3c whence  to  set  forward  is  Ocelis :  for  from  thence,  and  with %0a%3c the  West  Wind  called  Hypalus,  they  have  a  passage  of  forty %0a%3c Days'  Sailing  to  the  first  Town  of  Merchandise  in  India, %0a%3c called  Muziris.  However,  this  Port  is  not  to  be  ventured %0a%3c in,  because  of  the  neighbouring  Pirates,  which  keep  ordi- %0a%3c narily about  a  place  called  Hydrae;  and  it  is  not  richly %0a%3c stored  with  Merchandise.  And  moreover,  the  Station  of  the %0a%3c Ships  is  far  from  the  Land,  so  that  they  must  convey  their %0a%3c Wares  in  little  Boats  which  they  use  for  the  purpose.  At %0a%3c the  time  when  this  Account  was  written,  the  King  that %0a%3c reigned  there  was  named  Celebothras.

The  Region  from  whence %0a%3c they  transport  Pepper  in  small  Lighters  made  of  one  piece %0a%3c of  Wood  to  Becare,  is  named  Cotona  :  of  all  which  Nations, %0a%3c Ports,  and  Towns,  there  is  not  a  Name  found  in  any  of  the %0a%3c former  Writers.

When  they %0a%3c sail  from  India  they  have  the  (North-East)  Wind,  Vulturnus, %0a%3c with  them :  and  when  they  have  entered  into  the  Red  Sea, %0a%3c the  South  or  South-west.  Now  will  we  return  to  our  pro- %0a%3c posed Discourse  concerning  Carmania :  the  Coast  of  which, %0a%3c after  the  reckoning  of  Nearchus,  may  take  in  Circuit  12,050 %0a%3c Miles.  From  its  Beginning  to  the  River  Sabis  is  100  Miles; %0a%3c from  whence  as  far  as  to  the  River  Andanin,  are  Vineyards %0a%3c and  Corn-fields,  well  cultivated.  The  Region  is  called  Ar- %0a%3c muzia.  The  Towns  of  Carmania  are  Zetis  and  Alexandria. %0a%3c In  this  part  the  Sea  breaketh  into  the  Land  in  two  Arms ; %0a%3c which  our  Countrymen  call  the  Red  Sea,1  and  the  Greeks %0a%3c Erythrseum,  from  a  King  named  Erythras:  or  (as  some %0a%3c think)  because  the  Sea,  by  reason  of  the  Reflexion  of  the  Sun, %0a%3c seemeth  of  a  reddish  colour.  Others  suppose  that  this  Redness %0a%3c is  occasioned  of  the  Sand  and  Ground,  which  is  Red:  and  others %0a%3c again,  that  the  very  Water  is  of  its  own  nature  so  coloured. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  XXIV. %0a%3c The  Persian  and  Arabian  Gulfs. %0a%3c %0a%3c THIS  Red  Sea  is  divided  into  Two  Gulfs,     That  from  the %0a%3c East  is  named  the  Persian  Gulf,  and  is  in  Circuit  2500  Miles, %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  Another  reason  for  the  name  is  to  be  found  in  Esau,  the  son  of  the %0a%3c patriarch  Isaac,  and  whose  dominion  was  on  its  borders.  Bruce  and  others %0a%3c have  advanced  opinions  with  regard  to  the  origin  of  the  name  of  this  cele- %0a%3c brated sea ;  but  its  most  ancient  name  may  be  rendered  the  Weedy  Sea. %0a%3c -  Wern.

Overagainst  this  Gulf %0a%3c is  Arabia,  which  is  in  Length  1200  Miles.  On  the  other %0a%3c side  there  is  another  called  the  Arabian  Gulf,  which  runneth %0a%3c into  the  Ocean,  called  Azanius.  The  Mouth  of  the  Persian %0a%3c Gulf  is  Five  Miles  wide,  though  some  have  made  it  but %0a%3c Four.

The  Parthians  have  in  all  Eighteen  Realms %0a%3c under  them  :  for  so  they  divide  the  Provinces  about  the %0a%3c Two  Seas,  as  we  have  said,  the  Red  Sea  lying  southward, %0a%3c and  the  Hircan  Sea,  toward  the  north.  Of  these  Eleven, %0a%3c which  are  called  the  Higher  Provinces,  take  their  beginning %0a%3c from  the  Border  of  Armenia,  and  the  Coasts  of  the  Caspian  ; %0a%3c and  they  reach  to  the  Scythians,  with  whom  they  have  equal %0a%3c Intercourse  on  the  other  side.  The  other  Seven  are  called %0a%3c the  Lower  Provinces.  As  for  the  Parthians,  their  Land %0a%3c always  lay  at  the  Foot  of  those  Mountains  of  which  we  have %0a%3c so  often  spoken,  which  enclose  all  those  Nations.  It  hath %0a%3c on  the  East  the  Arii,  and  southward  Carmania  and  the %0a%3c Ariani ;  on  the  west  side  the  Pratitse  and  Medi ;  and  on %0a%3c the  North  the  Hircani ;  and  is  compassed  about  with  Deserts. %0a%3c The  farthest  Nations  of  the  Parthians  are  called  Nomades : %0a%3c beyond  the  Deserts  their  Cities  toward  the  West,  are  Issaris %0a%3c and  Calliope,  of  which  we  have  written  before  ;  but  toward %0a%3c the  North-east,  Europum ;  and  South-east,  Mania.

For  Media  on  the %0a%3c West  runneth  obliquely,  confronteth  the  Parthise,  and  en- %0a%3c closeth  both  these  Realms.  Therefore  on  the  East  side  it %0a%3c hath  the  Parthians  and  Caspians :  on  the  South,  Sittacene, %0a%3c Susiane,  and  Persis  ;  Westward,  Adiabene ;  and  Northward, %0a%3c Armenia.  The  Persians  always  dwelt  about  the  Red  Sea,  on %0a%3c which  account  it  was  called  the  Persian  Gulf.  The  Mari- %0a%3c time Coast  thereabout  is  called  Cyropolis,  and  that  part %0a%3c which  bordereth  upon  the  Medes  Elymais.

Moreover,  in  the %0a%3c Frontiers  standeth  Laodicea,  built  by  King  Antiochus. %0a%3c From  thence  towards  the  East  the  Magi  hold  the  Castle  of %0a%3c Passagardae,  wherein  is  the  Tomb  of  Cyrus.  Also  the  Town %0a%3c Ecbatana  belonging  to  the  Magi,  which  Darius  the  King %0a%3c caused  to  be  translated  to  the  Mountains.1  Between  the %0a%3c Parthians  and  the  Ariani  are  extended  the  Paraeraceni. %0a%3c These  Nations  and  the  River  Euphrates  serve  to  limit  the %0a%3c lower  Realms.  Now  are  we  to  discourse  of  the  Parts %0a%3c remaining  of  Mesopotamia  ;  setting  aside  one  point  thereof, %0a%3c and  the  People  of  Arabia,  whereof  we  spoke  in  the  former %0a%3c Book.  All  Mesopotamia  belonged  to  the  Assyrians,  dis- %0a%3c persed in  Villages,  except  Babylon  and  Ninus.  The  Mace- %0a%3c donians collected  it  into  Cities  on  account  of  the  goodness  of %0a%3c their  Soil.  Besides  the  above-named  Towns,  it  hath  Seleucia, %0a%3c Laodicea,  and  Artemita  :  likewise  within  the  Nation  of  the %0a%3c Arabians  named  Aroei  and  Mardani,  Antiochia :  and  that %0a%3c which,  being  founded  by  Nicanor,  Governor  of  Mesopotamia, %0a%3c is  called  Arabis.  Upon  these  join  the  Arabians,  but  within %0a%3c the  Country  are  the  Eldamarii.  Above  them  is  the  Town %0a%3c Bura,  situated  upon  the  River  Pelloconta ;  beyond  which  are %0a%3c the  Salmani  and  Masei,  Arabians.  Then  there  join  to  the %0a%3c Gordisei  the  Aloni,  by  whom  the  River  Zerbis  passeth,  and  so %0a%3c is  discharged  into  the  Tigris.

Some  Writers %0a%3c say  that  the  Euphrates  was  divided  by  a  Governor  of  Meso- %0a%3c potamia, and  one  Arm  of  it  brought  to  Gobaris  ;  which  was %0a%3c done  lest  the  River  should  endanger  the  City  of  Babylon. %0a%3c They  affirm,  moreover,  that  the  Assyrians  generally  called  it %0a%3c Armalchar,1  which  signifieth  a  Royal  River.  On  the  Place %0a%3c where  it  is  turned  there  stood  Agrani,  one  of  the  greatest %0a%3c Towns  of  that  Region,  which  the  Persians  utterly  destroyed. %0a%3c Babylon,2  the  Capital  of  the  Chaldean  Nations,  for  a  long- %0a%3c time possessed  an  illustrious  Name  through  all  the  World  :  in %0a%3c regard  of  which  the  other  Part  of  Mesopotamia  and  Assyria %0a%3c was  named  Babylonia  :  and  embracing  60  Miles.  The  Walls %0a%3c were  200  Feet  in  Height,  and  50  broad  :  reckoning  to  every %0a%3c Foot  three  Fingers'  Breadth  more  than  our  ordinary  Mea- %0a%3c sure. Through  the  midst  passeth  the  River  Euphrates :  with %0a%3c a  wonderful  Work,  on  both  Sides.

But  contrary  to  the  report  by  which  Pliny  professes  to  be %0a%3c guided,  this  ancient  Greek  author  represents  them  to  have  been  built  in %0a%3c the  form  of  a  square ;  and  although  the  lapse  of  time  may  have  caused  a %0a%3c variety  of  changes  to  take  place  in  other  particulars  regarding  this  city, %0a%3c we  can  scarcely  suppose  that  these  changes  can  have  extended  to  the %0a%3c dimensions  or  situation  of  its  stupendous  walls ;  by  which  alone  its  form %0a%3c would  be  influenced.     It  is  surprising  that  among  the  authors  which %0a%3c Pliny  had  consulted  in  drawing  up  his  account  of  these  regions,  he  makes %0a%3c no  mention  of  this  illustrious  Greek  writer,  though  he  quotes  him  in %0a%3c other  places.     Philostratus,  Solinus,  Diodorus,    Quintus  Curtius,  and %0a%3c more  especially  the  Bible,  may  be  consulted  for  a  variety  of  curious  par- %0a%3c ticulars regarding  this  eminent  and   powerful  city,  whose  walls  and %0a%3c splendour  are  now  buried  in  a  desert. —  Wern.

Nevertheless  it  is %0a%3c reduced  to  a  Desert,  having  been  exhausted  by  Seleucia, %0a%3c which  standeth  near  it :  and  which  was  for  that  very  purpose %0a%3c built  by  Nicator  within  the  Fortieth  Stone,  at  the  Place  of %0a%3c meeting  of  the  New  Channel  of  Euphrates  with  the  Tigris : %0a%3c nevertheless  it  is  named  Babylonia,  a  free  State  at  this  Day, %0a%3c of  independent  Jurisdiction;  but  they  live  after  the  Man- %0a%3c ners of  the  Macedonians.  And  by  report  there  are  600,000 %0a%3c common  Citizens.  The  Position  of  the  Walls,  by  report,  is %0a%3c in  the  form  of  an  Eagle  spreading  out  her  Wings  :  and  the %0a%3c Soil  is  the  most  Fertile  in  all  the  East.  The  Parthians, %0a%3c again,  to  exhaust  this  City,  built  Ctesiphon  within  the  Third %0a%3c Stone  from  it,  in  Chalonitis ;  which  now  is  the  Head %0a%3c of  the  Kingdom.  But  when  it  advanced  nothing,  King %0a%3c Vologesus  founded  another  Town  near  it,  called  Vologeso %0a%3c Certa.  There  are  also  in  Mesopotamia  the  Cities  Hyp- %0a%3c parenum,  a  City  likewise  of  the  Chaldaeans,  and  ennobled %0a%3c for  Learning,  and,  as  well  as  Babylon,  situated  near  the %0a%3c River  Narraga,  which  gave  the  Name  to  the  City.  The %0a%3c Persians  destroyed  the  Walls  of  this  Hypparenum.  There  are %0a%3c also  in  this  Tract  the  Orcheni,  toward  the  south  ;  and  a  Third %0a%3c Sect  of  the  Chaldaeans.  Beyond  this  Region  are  the  Notitae, %0a%3c Orthophantae,  and  Graeciochantae.  Nearchus  and  Onesi- %0a%3c critus  report,  That  from  the  Persian  Sea  to  Babylon,  by  the %0a%3c Voyage  up  the  Euphrates,  is  412  Miles.  But  later  Writers %0a%3c count  from  Seleucia  490  Miles.  Juba  writeth,  that  from %0a%3c Babylon  to  Charax  is  175  Miles.  Some  affirm  that  beyond %0a%3c Babylon  the  River  Euphrates  floweth  in  one  Channel  87 %0a%3c Miles,  before  it  is  divided  to  water  the  Country  :  its  entire %0a%3c Course  being  1200  Miles.  This  variety  in  Authors  is  the  cause %0a%3c of  the  Uncertainty  of  the  Measure,  considering  that  even  the %0a%3c very  Persians  agree  not  about  the  Dimensions  of  their %0a%3c Schceni  and  Parasangae,  but  have  different  Measures  of  them. %0a%3c Where  the  River  Euphrates  ceaseth  to  defend  by  its  own %0a%3c Channel,  at  the  portion  approaching  the  Border  of  Charax, %0a%3c there  is  great  danger  of  the  Robbers  called  Attalae,  a  Nation %0a%3c of  the  Arabians.

This  is  the  Breadth  there  of  the  Land  between %0a%3c the  two  Seas.  The  Kingdoms  of  Parthia  contain  944  Miles. %0a%3c Finally,  there  is  a  Town  of  Mesopotamia  on  the  Bank  of  the %0a%3c Tigris,  near  where  the  Rivers  meet,  which  they  call  Digba. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  XXVII. %0a%3c The  River  Tigris. %0a%3c %0a%3c IT  is  also  convenient  to  say  somewhat  of  the  River  Tigris %0a%3c itself.  It  beginneth  in  the  Region  of  Armenia  the  Greater, %0a%3c issuing  out  of  a  great  Source  in  the  Plain.  The  place  beareth %0a%3c the  Name  of  Elongosine.  The  River  itself,  so  long  as  it  run- %0a%3c neth slowly,  is  named  Diglito ;  but  when  it  beginneth  to  be %0a%3c rapid,  it  is  called  Tigris,  which  in  the  Median  language  sig- %0a%3c nifieth  a  Dart.  It  runneth  into  the  Lake  Arethusa,  which %0a%3c beareth  up  all  that  is  cast  into  it;  and  the  Vapours  that  arise %0a%3c out  of  it  carry  Clouds  of  Nitre.  In  this  Lake  there  is  but %0a%3c one  kind  of  Fish,  and  that  entereth  not  into  the  Channel  of %0a%3c the  Tigris  as  it  passeth  through ;  as  likewise  the  Fishes  of %0a%3c the  Tigris  do  not  swim  out  into  the  Water  of  the  Lake.  In %0a%3c its  Course  and  Colour  it  is  unlike  the  other :  and  when  it  is %0a%3c past  the  Lake  and  meeteth  the  Mountain  Taurus,  it  loseth %0a%3c itself  in  a  Cave,  and  so  runneth  under,  until  on  the  other %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  This  is  Tadmor  in  the  wilderness,  built  by  Solomon,  king  of  Israel, %0a%3c and  further  illustrious  from  being  the  city  where  the  critic  Longinus  was %0a%3c the  prime  minister  of  the  Queen  Zenobia.  It  is  now  truly  in  a  wilder- %0a%3c ness, but  is  still  celebrated  for  its  remains  of  antiquity :  chiefly  of  Greek %0a%3c construction.  There  are  many  streams  coming  down  from  the  adjacent %0a%3c mountains,  and  there  can  be  no  doubt  that  if  a  settled  tribe  fixed %0a%3c themselves  there,  the  tract  would  become  as  fine  an  oasis  as  erer. — %0a%3c Wern.

That  it  is  the  same  River  is  evident  by  this,  that  it %0a%3c carrieth  through  whatever  was  cast  into  it.  After  this  second %0a%3c Spring,  it  runneth  through  another  Lake,  named  Thospites, %0a%3c and  again  taketh  its  Way  under  the  Earth  through  Gutters, %0a%3c and  25  Miles  beyond  it  is  returned  about  Nymphaeum. %0a%3c Claudius  Caesar  reporteth,  that  in  the  Country  Arrhene,  it %0a%3c runneth  so  near  to  the  River  Arsanias,  that  when  they  both %0a%3c swell  they  join,  but  without  mingling  their  Water;  for  Arsa- %0a%3c nias, being  the  lighter,  floateth  over  the  other,  for  almost  the %0a%3c Space  of  four  Miles ;  but  soon  after  they  part  asunder,  and  it %0a%3c turneth  its  Course  toward  the  River  Euphrates,  into  which %0a%3c it  entereth.  But  Tigris  receiving  the  famous  Rivers  out  of %0a%3c Armenia  :  Parthenis,  Agnice,  and  Pharion,  so  dividing  the %0a%3c Arabians,  Aroeans,  and  the  Adiabeni,  and  by  this  means %0a%3c making,  as  we  have  said,  Mesopotamia  to  be  an  Island,  after %0a%3c it  hath  passed  by  and  viewed  the  Mountains  of  the  Gordiaei, %0a%3c near  Apamia,  a  Town  of  Mesene  on  this  side  Seleucia,  sur- %0a%3c named  Babylonia,  125  Miles.  Dividing  itself  into  two  Chan- %0a%3c nels, with  the  one  it  runneth  southward  to  Seleucia,  watering %0a%3c the  Country  of  Mesene  ;  and  with  the  other  it  windeth  to %0a%3c the  north,  on  the  back  of  the  said  Mesene,  and  cutteth %0a%3c through  the  Plains  of  the  Cauchians.  When  these  two %0a%3c Branches  are  united  again,  it  is  called  Pasitigris.  After  this %0a%3c it  receiveth  out  of  Media  the  Coaspes  ;  and  so  passing  be- %0a%3c tween Seleucia  and  Ctesiphon,  as  we  have  said,  it  poureth %0a%3c itself  into  the  Lakes  of  Chaldsea,  which  it  replenisheth  with %0a%3c Water  for  the  Compass  of  threescore  and  ten  Miles  :  which %0a%3c done,  it  issueth  forth,  gushing  out  with  a  very  great  Stream, %0a%3c and  on  the  right  of  the  Town  Charax  is  discharged  into  the %0a%3c Persian  Sea,  by  a  Mouth  ten  Miles  over.  Between  the %0a%3c Mouths  of  these  two  Rivers  were  25  Miles,  or,  as  some  say, %0a%3c seven  :  and  both  of  them  were  navigable.  But  the  Orcheni %0a%3c and  other  neighbouring  Inhabitants  long  since  turned  the %0a%3c Course  of  Euphrates  aside  to  water  their  Fields,  insomuch %0a%3c that  it  is  conveyed  into  the  Sea,  only  through  the  Tigris. %0a%3c The  next  Country  bordering  upon  the  Tigris  is  called  Para- %0a%3c potamia  :  in  it  is  Mesene,  of  which  we  have  spoken.

Chalonitis  is  joined  with  Ctesiphon,  noble %0a%3c not  only  with  Date-trees,  but  also  with  Olive,  Apple,  and %0a%3c Pear-trees,  and  generally  with  all  sorts  of  Fruit.  Unto  this %0a%3c Country  extendeth  the  Mountain  Zagrus,  coming  out  of  Ar- %0a%3c menia, between  the  Medes  and  Adiabeni,  above  Paraetacene %0a%3c and  Persis.  Chalonitis  is  distant  from  Persis  480  Miles. %0a%3c Some  write,  that  by  the  nearest  Way  it  is  so  much  from  the %0a%3c Caspian  Sea  to  Assyria.  Between  these  Nations  and  Mesene %0a%3c lieth  Sittacene,  the  same  that  is  called  Arbelitis  and  Pales- %0a%3c tine. The  Towns  therein  are  Sittace  of  the  Graecians,  toward %0a%3c the  east,  and  Sabata ;  but  on  the  West,  Antiochia,  between %0a%3c two  Rivers,  Tigris  and  Tornadotus.  Also  Apamia,  which %0a%3c Antiochus  so  called  after  his  Mother's  Name.  This  City %0a%3c is  environed  with  the  River  Tigris,  and  divided  by  the  River %0a%3c Archous.  Somewhat  lower  is  Susiane,  wherein  (is)  Susa, %0a%3c the  ancient  Region  of  the  Persians,  founded  by  Darius,  the %0a%3c Son  of  Hystaspes ;  and  from  Seleucia  Babylonia,  it  is  distant %0a%3c 450  Miles ;  and  as  much  from  Ecbatana  of  the  Medes, %0a%3c through  the  Mountain  Charbanus.  Upon  that  Channel  of %0a%3c the  Tigris  which  taketh  its  Course  northward,  standeth  the %0a%3c Town  Babytace  :  and  from  Susa  it  is  135  Miles.  The  People %0a%3c of  this  Country  are  the  only  Men  in  the  World  that  hate %0a%3c Gold :  and  they  bury  it,  that  it  may  serve  for  no  use  to  any %0a%3c one.  To  the  Susiani  eastward  are  joined  the  Cossiaei  Rob- %0a%3c bers, and  forty  Nations  of  the  Mizsei,  free  and  wild.  Above %0a%3c these  lie  the  Parthusi,  Mardi,  Saitae,  and  Hyi,  who  are %0a%3c spread  abroad  above  Elemais,  which  joineth  to  the  maritime %0a%3c Coasts  of  Persis,  as  is  above  said.  Susa  is  from  the  Persian %0a%3c Sea  250  Miles.  On  that  Side  where  the  Fleet  of  Alexander %0a%3c came  up  the  Pasitigris,  there  standeth  a  Village  upon  the %0a%3c Lake  Chaldais,  named  Aphle :  from  which  to  Susa  is  65| %0a%3c Miles  by  Water.  The  next  that  border  upon  the  Susiani %0a%3c eastward  are  the  Cossaei  ;  and  above  the  Cossaei  northward %0a%3c lieth  Mesobatene,  under  the  Mountain  Cambiladus,  which  is %0a%3c a  Branch  of  the  Caucasus :  and  from  thence  is  the  most  easy %0a%3c Passage  to  the  Bactri.  The  River  Eulaeus  maketh  a  Parti- %0a%3c tion between  Elimais  and  Susiane.  This  River  riseth  in  the %0a%3c Country  of  the  Medi,  and  in  the  midst  of  its  Course  loseth %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BOOK  VI.]  History  of  Nature.  145 %0a%3c %0a%3c itself  in  the  Ground  ;  but  rising  again,  and  running  through %0a%3c Mesobatene,  it  passeth  round  the  Castle  of  the  Susi  and  the %0a%3c Temple   of  Diana,  the  most  august  Temple  among  those %0a%3c Nations  :   and   the  very  River  itself  is   ceremoniously  re- %0a%3c garded :  so  that  the  Kings  drink  of  no  other,  and  therefore %0a%3c they  carry  it  to  a  great  distance.     It  receiveth  the  River %0a%3c Hedypnus,  which  corneth  along  by  the  Asylum  of  the  Per- %0a%3c sians, and  one  from  among  the  Susiani.    A  Town  there  is  near %0a%3c it,  called  Magoa,  15  Miles  from  Charax.  Some  place  this  Town %0a%3c in  the  utmost  Borders  of  Susiana,  close  to  the  Deserts.     Be- %0a%3c neath Eulaeus  lieth  Elymais,  joining  to  Persis  on  the  Sea- %0a%3c coast  ;  it  is  240  Miles  from  the  River  Oroates  to  Charax.  The %0a%3c Towns  in  it  are  Seleucia  and  Sositare,  situated  upon  the %0a%3c Mountain  Casyrus.     The  Coast  which  lieth  before  it  is,  as %0a%3c we  have  said  before,  no  less  dangerous  than  the  Lesser  Syrtes, %0a%3c because  of  the  Mud  and  Slime  which  the  Rivers  Brixia  and %0a%3c Ortacea  bring  down;  and  Elimais  itself  is  so    moist   that %0a%3c there  is  no  Way  to  Persis  but  by  taking  a  Circuit  about %0a%3c it.     It  is  also  much  infested  with  Serpents,  which   those %0a%3c Rivers  bring  down :  but  that  part  of  it  is  the  least  passable %0a%3c which  they  call  Characene,  from  the  Town  (Charax),  which %0a%3c limiteth  the  Kingdoms  of  Arabia  :  of  which  we  will  speak %0a%3c by  and  by,  after  we  have  set  down  the  Opinion  ofM.Agrippa; %0a%3c for  he  hath  written,  that  Media,  Parthia,  and  Persis,  are %0a%3c bounded  on  the  East  by  the  Indus ;  on  the  West,  by  the %0a%3c Tigris  ;  on  the  North,  by  the  Taurus  and  Caucasus ;  and  on %0a%3c the  South,  by  the  Red  Sea :  also,  that  they  extend  in  Length %0a%3c 1320  Miles,  and  in  Breadth  840.     Moreover,  that  Mesopo- %0a%3c tamia by  itself  is  enclosed  eastward  by  the  Tigris,  westward  by %0a%3c the  Euphrates ;  on  the  North  by  the  Taurus,  and  on  the  South %0a%3c by  the  Persian  Sea;  being  in  Length  800  Miles,  and  in %0a%3c Breadth  360.     Charax  is  the  inmost  Town  of  the  Persian %0a%3c Gulf,  from  which  Arabia,  called  Eudaemon  (happy)  runneth %0a%3c forth  in  Length;  it  is  situated  upon  a  Mount  artificially %0a%3c raised  between  the  Confluence  of  Tigris  on  the  right  Hand, %0a%3c and  Eulseus  on  the  left :  with  an  Expansion  of  three  Miles. %0a%3c It  was  first  founded  by  Alexander  the  Great ;  who,  having %0a%3c drawn  Colonists  out  of  the  royal  City  Durine  (which  then %0a%3c %0a%3c VOL.  II.  L %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 146  History  of  Nature.  [BOOK  VI. %0a%3c %0a%3c was  ruined),  and  leaving  there  behind  him  those  Soldiers %0a%3c which  were  not  fit  for  service,  ordained  that  this  Town  should %0a%3c be  called  Alexandria ;  and  the  District  about  it,  Pellseum, %0a%3c from  his  native  Country  :  and  he  peopled  it  only  with  Mace- %0a%3c donians. This  Town  was  destroyed  by  the  Rivers.  After- %0a%3c wards, Antiochus,  the  fifth  of  the  Kings,  rebuilt  it,  and %0a%3c named  it  from  himself.  But  when  it  was  injured  again, %0a%3c Spasines,  Son  of  Sogdonacus,  King  of  the  adjoining  Arabians, %0a%3c and  not  (as  Juba  reporteth)  a  Lord  (Satrap)  under  Antiochus, %0a%3c restored  it  by  Moles  opposite  each  other,  and  called  it  after %0a%3c his  own  Name.  He  thus  fortified  the  Site  of  it  three  Miles  in %0a%3c Length  and  little  less  in  Breadth.  At  the  beginning  it  stood %0a%3c upon  the  Sea-coast,  being  from  the  Water-side  ten  Stadia ; %0a%3c and  even  from  thence  it  hath  false  Galleries :  but  by  the %0a%3c Report  of  Juba,  in  his  Time,  50  Miles.  At  this  Day  the %0a%3c Arabian  Ambassadors,  and  also  our  Merchants  that  come  from %0a%3c thence,  affirm  it  is  from  the  Sea-shore  125  Miles :  so  that  it %0a%3c cannot  be  found  in  any  Place  that  the  Earth  hath  gained %0a%3c more,  or  in  so  short  a  Time  by  means  of  the  Mud  brought %0a%3c down  by  Rivers.  And  it  is  the  more  wonderful,  that  the %0a%3c Tide  which  riseth  far  beyond  this  Town  doth  not  carry  it %0a%3c away  again.  In  this  very  Town  I  am  not  ignorant  that %0a%3c Dionysius,  the  latest  of  our  modern  Geographers,  was  born  : %0a%3c whom  Divus  Augustus  sent  before  into  the  East  to  write  a %0a%3c Description  of  whatever  he  found,  for  the  Information  of  his %0a%3c elder  Son,  who  was  about  to  proceed  into  Armenia,  in  an %0a%3c Expedition  against  the  Parthians  and  Arabians.  It  has  not %0a%3c escaped  me,  nor  is  it  forgotten,  that  in  my  first  Entrance  into %0a%3c this  Work,  I  professed  to  follow  those  who  had  written  of %0a%3c their  own  Countries,  as  being  the  most  diligent  in  that  be- %0a%3c half. Nevertheless,  in  this  Place  I  choose  rather  to  follow %0a%3c the  Roman  Officers  that  have  warred  there,  and  King  Juba, %0a%3c in  Books  written  to  C.  Ccesar  (Caligula)  concerning  the %0a%3c aame  Arabian  Expedition. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BOOK  VI.]  History  of  Nature.  147 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  XXVIII. %0a%3c %0a%3c Arabia,  Nomades,  Nalatcei,  and  Omani:  the  Islands  Tylos %0a%3c and  Ogyris. %0a%3c %0a%3c ARABIA  cometh  behind  none  of  the  Nations  for  its  great %0a%3c Length  and  Extent ;  for  it  beginneth  at  the  Descent  of  the %0a%3c Mountain  Amanus,  overagainst  Cilicia  and  Comagen£,  as  we %0a%3c have  before  said ;  where  it  is  peopled  with  many  Nations  of %0a%3c them,  brought  by  Tigranes  the  Great  to  inhabit  that  Quarter; %0a%3c and  in  old  Time  it  descended  naturally  as  far  as  to  our  Sea %0a%3c and  the  Egyptian  Coast,  as  we  have  shewn :  yea,  and  it %0a%3c extendeth  into  the  midland  Parts  of  Syria  to  the  Mountain %0a%3c Libanus,  where  the  Hills  reach  to  the  very  Clouds  :  to %0a%3c which  are  joined  the  Ramasi ;  then  the  Taranei,  and  after %0a%3c them  the  Patami.  The  Peninsula  itself  of  Arabia  runneth %0a%3c out  between  two  Seas,  the  Red  and  the  Persian,  by  a %0a%3c certain  Workmanship  of  Nature,  resembling  Italy  in  Form %0a%3c and  Magnitude,  with  its  Sea-coasts  also  in  the  manner  of %0a%3c Italy.  It  also  regardeth  the  same  Quarter  of  the  Heaven %0a%3c without  any  Difference.  This  Tract,  for  the  rich  Seat  it %0a%3c hath,  is  named  Felix  (happy).  The  Nations  therein  dwell- %0a%3c ing, from  our  Sea  to  the  Deserts  of  Palmyra,  we  have  treated %0a%3c of  already,  therefore  we  pass  them  by.  The  Nomades,  and %0a%3c those  Robbers  that  trouble  the  Chaldseans,  the  People %0a%3c called  Scenitse,  border  on  it  as  we  have  before  said ;  they  also %0a%3c are  Wanderers,  but  are  so  called  from  their  Tabernacles, %0a%3c which  they  make  of  Hair-cloths,  and  they  encamp  under %0a%3c them  as  they  please.  Being  past  them  you  find  the  Nabatsei, %0a%3c who  inhabit  a  Town  named  Petra,  in  the  Valley,  little  less %0a%3c than  two  Miles  large ;  environed  with  very  steep  Mountains, %0a%3c and  having  a  River  running  through  the  midst  of  it.  It %0a%3c is  distant  from  Gaza  (a  Town  of  our  Coast)  600  Miles ;  and %0a%3c from  the  Persian  Gulf,  122.  And  here  meet  both  the  High- %0a%3c ways, that  is,  the  one  which  Passengers  travel  to  Palmyra  in %0a%3c Syria,  and  the  other  wherein  they  come  from  Gaza.  Beyond %0a%3c Petra  the  Omani  inhabit  as  far  as  to  Carax,  in  the  celebrated %0a%3c Towns  built  by  Semiramis,  namely,  Abesamis  and  Soractia. %0a%3c But  now  all  is  a  Wilderness,  Then  come  you  to  a  Town %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 148  History  of  Nature.  [BooK  VI. %0a%3c %0a%3c named  Forath,  situated  upon  the  Bank  of  the  Pasitigris,  and %0a%3c subject  to  the  King  of  the  Caraceni :  to  which  they  resort %0a%3c from  Petra;  and  from  thence  to  Charax  they  sail  with  a %0a%3c favourable  Tide  for  the  Space  of  twelve  Miles.  But  they %0a%3c that  come  by  Water  out  of  the  Parthian  Kingdom,  meet  with %0a%3c a  Village  called  Teredon,  below  the  Place  where  Euphrates %0a%3c and  Tigris  meet.  The  Chaldaeans  inhabit  the  left  Bank  of %0a%3c the  River,  and  the  Nomades  called  Scenitse,  the  right.  Some %0a%3c affirm,  that  as  you  sail  on  the  Tigris,  you  pass  by  two  other %0a%3c Towns,  distant  from  each  other :  the  one  called  formerly %0a%3c Barbatia,  and  afterwards  Thumata,  which  our  Merchants %0a%3c report  to  be  ten  Days'  Sail  from  Petra,  and  to  be  subject  to %0a%3c the  King  of  the  Characeni :  and  the  other  named  Apamia, %0a%3c situated  in  the  Place  where  the  Overflowing  of  Euphrates %0a%3c joineth  with  the  Tigris ;  and  therefore  they  prevent  the  In- %0a%3c vasion of  the  Parthians,  by  breaking  up  the  Banks  and  so %0a%3c procure  an  Inundation  of  the  Waters.  Now  being  past  Cha- %0a%3c rax, we  will  discourse  of  the  Coast  first  explored  by  Epi- %0a%3c phanes.  The  Place  where  the  Mouth  of  the  Euphrates  was. %0a%3c A  River  of  Salt  Water  ;  the  Promontory  Chaldone,  where  the %0a%3c Sea  is  more  like  a  Whirlpool  than  a  Sea,  for  50  Miles.  The %0a%3c River  Achana  ;  Deserts  for  100  Miles,  until  you  come  to  the %0a%3c Island  Ichara  :  the  Bay  Capeus,  which  the  Gaulopes  and %0a%3c Chateni  inhabit :  the  Bay  Gerraicus,  and  the  Town  Gerra, %0a%3c five  Miles  in  extent ;  and  fortified  with  Towers  made  of  square %0a%3c Masses  of  Salt.  Fifty  Miles  from  the  Sea-side  is  the  Region %0a%3c Attene :  and  overagainst  it  the  Island  Tylos,  as  many  Miles %0a%3c from  the  Shore,  with  a  Town  bearing  the  Name  of  the  Island, %0a%3c much  celebrated  for  Abundance  of  Pearls  :  and  not  far  from %0a%3c it  is  another  somewhat  less,  twelve  Miles  from  the  Cape  of %0a%3c the  aforesaid  Tylos.  Beyond  these  there  are  discovered  by %0a%3c Report  some  great  Islands ;  but  they  have  not  been  visited %0a%3c by  our  Merchants.  This  last  Island  is  112  Miles  and  a  half %0a%3c in  Circuit,  and  is  far  from  Persis ;  and  Access  to  it  is  only %0a%3c by  one  narrow  Channel.  The  Island  Asgilia  ;  the  Nations %0a%3c Nocheti,  Zurachi,  Borgodi,  Catarsei,  and  Nomades :  the %0a%3c River  Cynos.  Beyond  that,  Juba  saith,  there  is  no  more %0a%3c Navigation  discovered  on  that  Side,  by  reason  of  the  Rocks. %0a%3c He  hath  made  no  mention  of  the  Town  Batrasabe  of  the %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BOOK  VI.]  History  of  Nature.  1 49 %0a%3c %0a%3c Omani,  nor  of  Omana,  which  former  Geographers  have %0a%3c held  to  be  a  Harbour  of  great  Importance  in  Carmania. %0a%3c Also,  Omne  and  Athanae,  which  our  Merchants  report  to  be %0a%3c at  this  Day  two  very  famous  Towns,  frequented  from  the %0a%3c Persian  Gulf.  Beyond  the  River  Canis,  as  King  Juba %0a%3c writeth,  there  is  a  Hill  which  seemeth  all  scorched.  The %0a%3c Nations  of  the  Epimaranitae :  and  soon  after  the  Ichthyo- %0a%3c phagi  :  a  desert  Island  ;  the  Nations  Bathymi.  The  Moun- %0a%3c tains Eblitaei ;  the  Island  Omcenus  ;  the  Port  Machorbae,  the %0a%3c Islands  Etaxalos,  Onchobrice,  the  Nation  Chadaei.  Many %0a%3c Islands  without  a  Name  :  but  of  Importance,  Isura,  Rhinnea  ; %0a%3c and  another  very  near,  wherein  are  Pillars  of  Stone  inscribed %0a%3c with  unknown  Characters.  The  Port  of  Goboea;  and  the %0a%3c desert  Islands  Bragae.  The  Nation  of  the  Thaludsei :  the %0a%3c Region  Dabanegoris :  the  Mountain  Orsa,  with  a  Port : %0a%3c the  Bay  Duatus,  and  many  Islands.  The  Mountain  Tricory- %0a%3c phus :  the  Region  Cardalena,  the  Islands  Solanidae,  Capina. %0a%3c Also  the  Islands  of  the  Ichthyophagi :  and  after  them  the %0a%3c Glari.  The  Shore  called  Hamruaeum,  where  are  Gold  Mines. %0a%3c The  Region  Canauna.  The  Nations  Apitami  and  Gasani. %0a%3c The  Island  Deuadae;  the  Fountain  Goralus;  theGarpheti; %0a%3c the  Islands  Aleu  and  Amnamethu.  The  Nation  called %0a%3c Darrae,  the  Islands  Chelonitis,  and  many  of  the  Ichthyo- %0a%3c phagi. The  Isle  Eodanda,  which  is  Desert,  and  Basage  ; %0a%3c many  others  of  the  Sabaei.  The  Rivers  Thamar  and  Amnon  ; %0a%3c the  Islands  Dolicae ;  the  Fountains  Daulotes  and  Dora ;  the %0a%3c Islands,  Pteros,  Labanis,  Coboris,  Sambracate,  with  a  Town %0a%3c so  named  on  the  Continent.  On  the  South  side  are  many %0a%3c Islands,  but  the  greatest  of  them  is  Camari.  The  River %0a%3c Mysecros ;  the  Port  Leupas,  and  the  Sabaeans,  called  Sce- %0a%3c nitae.  Many  other  Islands  ;  their  Chief  Town  of  Merchandise %0a%3c is  Acila,  where  the  Merchants  embark  for  their  Voyage  to %0a%3c India.  The  Region  Amithoscuta,  and  Damnia.  The  Mizi, %0a%3c the  Greater  and  Less  :  the  Drimati  and  Macae.  The  Promon- %0a%3c tory of  these  People  is  overagainst  Carmania,  and  distant %0a%3c from  it  50  Miles.  A  wonderful  thing  is  reported  there  :  that %0a%3c Numenius,  Chief  Commander  under  King  Antiochus,  over %0a%3c Mesena,  conquered  the  Navy  of  the  Persians  in  a  Sea-fight, %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 150  History  of  Nature.

Far  out  at  Sea  there  lieth  an %0a%3c Island  called  Ogyris,  distant  from  the  Continent  125  Miles, %0a%3c and  containing  in  Circuit  112;  much  renowned  for  the %0a%3c Sepulchre  of  King  Erythra,  who  was  buried  there.  Another %0a%3c there  is  no  less  famous,  called  Dioscoridu,  in  the  Sea  Aza- %0a%3c nium ;  and  it  is  from  Syagrum,  the  extremest  Cape,  280 %0a%3c Miles.  There  remain  yet  not  spoken  of,  the  Autarides, %0a%3c toward  the  South,  in  the  Mountains,  which  continue  for %0a%3c seven  Days'  journey :  the  Nations  Larendani,  Catabani,  and %0a%3c Gebanitse,  who  have  many  Towns,  but  the  greatest  are  Nagia %0a%3c and  Tarnna,  with  65  Temples  within  it,  which  is  a  mark  how %0a%3c great  it  is.  A  Promontory,  from  which  to  the  Continent  of %0a%3c the  Trogloditse  is  50  Miles.  The  Toani,  Acchitee,  Chatra- %0a%3c motitse,  Tomabei,  Antidalei,  Lexianse,  Agrei,  Cerbani ;  and %0a%3c Sabaei,  of  all  the  Arabians  most  famous  for  their  Frankin- %0a%3c cense ;  their  Nations  reaching  from  Sea  to  Sea.  Their  Towns %0a%3c on  the  Coast  of  the  Red  Sea  are  Marane,  Marma,  Corolla, %0a%3c and  Sabatra ;  within-land  are  the  Towns  Nascus,  Cardava, %0a%3c Carnus,  and  Tomala,  whence  they  convey  their  Commodities %0a%3c of  Aromatics.  One  part  of  them  are  the  Atramitse,  whose %0a%3c Capital  City,  Sobotale,  had  within  its  Walls  Sixty  Temples. %0a%3c But  the  Royal  City  of  the  whole  is  Nariaba,  situated  on  a %0a%3c Gulf  that  reacheth  into  the  Land  ninety-four  Miles,  full  of %0a%3c Islands,  having  Odoriferous  Trees.  Upon  the  Atramitse, %0a%3c within  the  Mainland,  are  joined  the  Minaei :  but  the  Ela- %0a%3c mitae  inhabit  the  Sea  (Coast),  where  standeth  a  City  also  called %0a%3c Elamitum.  To  them  are  joined  the  Cagulatae ;  and  their %0a%3c Town  is  Siby,  which  the  Greeks  name  A  pate.  Then  the %0a%3c Arsicodani,  and  Vadei,  with  a  great  Town  :  and  the  Barasei : %0a%3c Lichenia,  and  the  Island  Sygaros,  which  Dogs  will  not  enter ; %0a%3c and  if  any  be  put  there,  they  wander  about  the  Shore  until %0a%3c they  die.  A  Deep  Bay,  in  which  are  the  Leanitae,  who  gave %0a%3c name  to  it.  Their  Royal  City  is  Agra :  but  Leana,  or,  as %0a%3c others  have  it,  ^lana,  is  in  the  Bay.  And  hence  our %0a%3c Writers  have  called  that  Bay  jElaniticum,  which  others %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BOOK  VI.]  History  of  Nature.  151 %0a%3c %0a%3c have  termed  JSlenaticum  ;  Artemidorus,  Aleniticum  ;  and %0a%3c Juba,  Lseniticum.  Arabia  is  reported  to  take  in  Circuit  from %0a%3c Charax  to  Leana,  4870  Miles ;  but  Juba  thinketh  it  some- %0a%3c what less  than  4000.  It  is  widest  in  the  North  Parts,  be- %0a%3c tween the  Towns  Herons  and  Charace.  Now  it  remaineth %0a%3c that  we  speak  of  other  Parts  within  the  Midland  thereof. %0a%3c The  Ancients  joined  the  Nabataei  to  the  Thimanei ;  but  at %0a%3c this  Day  there  are  the  Tavern,  Suelleni,  and  Sarraceni :  the %0a%3c Town  is  Arra,  wherein  all  Business  is  assembled.  The  He- %0a%3c rnuatse  and  Analitae ;  the  Towns  Domada  and  Erag£ ;  the %0a%3c Thamusians,  with  their  Town  Badanatha;  the  Carrei,  and %0a%3c their  Town  Chariati ;  the  Achoali,  and  their  Town  Phoda. %0a%3c Furthermore,  the  Minaei,  descended,  as  some  think,  from %0a%3c Minos,  King  of  Crete  ;  whose  Town  Charmaei  is  14  Miles  (in %0a%3c Compass) ;  Mariaba,  Baramalacum,  a  Town  not  to  be  de- %0a%3c spised; likewise  Carnon,  and  the  Rhamei,  who  are  thought %0a%3c to  spring  from  Rhadamanthus,  the  Brother  of  Minos.  The %0a%3c Homeritae,  with  the  Town  Massala ;  the  Hamirci,  Gedra- %0a%3c nitae,  Anaprae,  Ilisanitae,  Bochilitae,  Sammei,  and  Amathei ; %0a%3c with  the  Towns,  Nessa  and  Cennesseri.  The  Zamareni,  with %0a%3c the  Towns  Saiace,  Scantate,  and  Bacascani ;  the  Town  Rhi- %0a%3c phearma,  which  in  the  Arabian  Tongue  signifieth  Barley ; %0a%3c also  the  Autei,  Raui,  Gyrei,  and  Marhatsei ;  the  Helmodones, %0a%3c with  the  Town  Ebode ;  the  Agacturi  in  the  Mountains,  hav- %0a%3c ing a  Town  20  Miles  in  Circuit,  wherein  is  a  Fountain  called %0a%3c Emischabales,  which  signifies  the  Camel's  Town  ;  Ampelone, %0a%3c a  Colony  of  the  Milesii ;  the  Town  Actrida ;  the  Calingii, %0a%3c whose  Town  is  named  Mariaba,  which  signifies  Lords  of  all. %0a%3c Towns  Pallon  and  Murannimal,  near  a  River,  by  which  they %0a%3c think  that  the  Euphrates  springeth  forth.  The  Nations %0a%3c Agrei  and  Ammonii ;  the  Town  Athenas  ;  the  Caurarani, %0a%3c which  signifieth  very  rich  in  Cattle.  The  Caranitae,  Caesani, %0a%3c and  Choani.  There  were  also  Towns  in  Arabia,  held  by %0a%3c Greeks,  as  Arethusa,  Larissa,  and  Chalcis,  which  were %0a%3c destroyed  in  various  Wars.  The  only  Roman  until  this  day %0a%3c that  carried  our  Arms  into  those  Parts  was  jElius  Gallus,  of %0a%3c the  Knightly  Order.  For  Gains  Ccesar,  the  Son  of  Augustus, %0a%3c did  but  look  only  into  Arabia ;  but  Gallus  destroyed  Towns, %0a%3c not  named  by  Authors  that  wrote  before :  Egra,  Annestum, %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 152  History  of  Nature.

The  other  matters  he  made  report  of  were, %0a%3c that  the  Nomades  live  on  Milk  and  Wild  Animals  ;  the  rest %0a%3c express  Wine,  as  the  Indians  do,  out  of  Dates ;  and  Oil  of %0a%3c Sesama.  That  the  Homerites  are  the  most  Populous ;  the %0a%3c Minasi  have  Fruitful  Fields,  full  of  Palm-trees  and  Vine- %0a%3c yards, but  their  Riches  is  in  Cattle.  The  Cembani  and %0a%3c Arii  excel  in  Arras,  but  chiefly  the  Chatramotitse.  The %0a%3c Carseans  have  the  largest  Territories  and  most  Fertile %0a%3c Fields.  The  Sabsei  are  Richest  in  the  Fertility  of  their %0a%3c Woods,  that  bring  forth  Aromatic  Gums  :  also  in  Mines  of %0a%3c Gold ;  having  Water  to  refresh  their  Lands,  and  plenty  of %0a%3c Honey  and  Wax.  Of  the  Spices  that  come  from  thence  we %0a%3c will  speak  in  a  Book  by  itself.  The  Arabians  wear  Mitres,1 %0a%3c or  go  with  their  Hair  long ;  their  Beards  they  shave,  except %0a%3c on  the  upper  Lip ;  and  yet  some  there  are  that  suffer  their %0a%3c Beards  to  grow  long.  But  one  thing  is  surprising,  that  out %0a%3c of  such  a  very  great  number  of  People,  the  one-half  live  by %0a%3c Robbery,  and  the  other  by  Merchandise.  On  the  whole %0a%3c they  are  exceedingly  rich ;  for  with  them  the  Romans  and %0a%3c Parthians  leave  very  large  Sums,  for  the  Commodities  out %0a%3c of  their  Woods  and  Seas  which  they  sell  them ;  and  them- %0a%3c selves buy  nothing  of  them  in  return.  Now  will  we  speak  of %0a%3c the  other  Coast  opposite  to  Arabia.  Timosthenes  hath  set %0a%3c down,  that  the  whole  Gulf  was  from  one  End  to  the  other %0a%3c Four  Days'  Sailing :  and  from  Side  to  Side,  Two  Days' ;  the %0a%3c Breadth  of  the  Straits  being  Seven  Miles  over.  Eratosthenes %0a%3c saith,  that  taking  the  Measure  at  the  very  Mouth,  it  is  every %0a%3c way  1300  Miles. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  XXIX. %0a%3c %0a%3c The  Gulf  of  the  Red  Sea :  likewise  of  the  Trogloditic  and %0a%3c ^Ethiopian  Seas. %0a%3c %0a%3c ARTEMIDORUS  saith,  that  the  Red  Sea  toward  the  side  of %0a%3c Arabia  is  1450  Miles :  but  on  the  Coast  of  the  Trogloditse  1 1 82, %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  It  is  a  question  whether  these  are  not  rather  turbans,  as  at  present %0a%3c extensively  worn  through  Asia. — Wern,  Club. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BOOK  VI.]  History  of  Nature.  153 %0a%3c %0a%3c until  you  come  to  Ptolemais  :  but  Agrippa  1322,  without  any %0a%3c distinction  of  the  Sides.  Most  Geographers  have  set  down %0a%3c the  Breadth  to  be  462  Miles :  and  the  Mouth  of  it  against %0a%3c the  Sun-rising  in  Winter,  (i.  e.  South-west)  some  say,  is  7 %0a%3c Miles  Broad ;  and  others  12.  The  Situation  of  it  is  this : %0a%3c Beyond  the  Bay  called  JElaniticus  there  is  another  Bay %0a%3c which  the  Arabians  call  jEant,  on  which  standeth  the  Town %0a%3c Heroon.  There  was  also  Cambisu,  between  the  Neli  and %0a%3c Marchandae,  into  which  the  sick  Soldiers  were  conveyed. %0a%3c The  Nation  of  Tyra  ;  the  Port  Daneon,  from  which  Sesostris, %0a%3c King  of  Egypt,  was  the  first  that  imagined  to  conduct  a %0a%3c Navigable  Channel  into  the  Nile,  in  that  part  where  it %0a%3c runneth  to  the  Place  called  Delta,  for  the  Space  of  62 %0a%3c Miles ;  which  is  between  the  River  and  the  Red  Sea.  This %0a%3c Enterprise  was  followed  by  Darius,  King  of  the  Persians  : %0a%3c and  afterwards  by  Ptolomceus,  who  also  made  a  Channel %0a%3c 100  Feet  in  Breadth,  and  30  Deep,  for  Thirty-Seven  Miles %0a%3c and  a  Half  in  Length,  even  to  the  Bitter  Fountains.  But %0a%3c this  Design  went  no  farther,  through  fear  of  an  Inundation : %0a%3c the  Red  Sea  being  found  to  lie  Three  Cubits  above  the  Land %0a%3c of  Egypt.  Some  allege  that  this  was  not  the  true  cause, %0a%3c but  that  if  the  Sea  were  let  into  the  Nile  the  Water  thereof %0a%3c (of  which  only  they  drink)  would  be  corrupted.  Never- %0a%3c theless the  Way  is  well  frequented  from  the  Egyptian  Sea  ; %0a%3c and  there  are  Three  ordinary  Ways  there :  one  from  Pelu- %0a%3c sium  over  the  Sands,  where,  unless  Reeds  be  set  up  in  the %0a%3c Ground  for  direction,  no  Path  would  be  found,  because  the %0a%3c Wind  bloweth  the  Sand  over  the  Tracts  of  the  Feet.  A %0a%3c second  beginneth  Two  Miles  beyond  the  Mountain  Casius, %0a%3c which  after  sixty  Miles  returneth  into  the  Pelusiac  Way. %0a%3c Here  the  Arabians  called  Autei  inhabit.  The  Third  begin- %0a%3c neth at  Gereum,  which  they  call  Adipson,  and  passeth %0a%3c through  these  same  Arabians,  being  Sixty  Miles  nearer,  but %0a%3c full  of  craggy  Hills,  and  altogether  destitute  of  Water.  All %0a%3c these  Ways  lead  to  Arsinoe,  which  was  built  upon  the  Gulf %0a%3c Charandra  by  Ptolemceus  Philadelphus,  and  bearing  his %0a%3c Sister's  Name :  and  he  was  the  first  that  searched  narrowly %0a%3c into  the  Region  Trogloditicum  ;  and  the  River  that  passeth %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 154  History  of  Nature.  [BooK  VI. %0a%3c %0a%3c by  Arsinoe  he  called  Ptolemseus.  Within  a  little  of  this %0a%3c Place  there  is  a  small  Town  named  Aennum,  for  which %0a%3c some  write  Philotera.  Beyond  them  are  the  Azarei :  wild %0a%3c Arabians  from  Marriages  of  the  Trogloditee.  The  Islands %0a%3c Sapyren£  and  Scytala :  and  within  a  little,  Deserts,  unto %0a%3c Myros-hormos,  where  is  the  Fountain  called  Tadnos ;  the %0a%3c Mountain  Eos ;  the  Island  Larnbe,  many  Harbours ;  and %0a%3c Berenice,  a  Town  bearing  the  Name  of  the  Mother  of  Phila- %0a%3c delphus ;  to  which  there  is  a  Way  lying  from  Coptos,  as  we %0a%3c have  said  :  the  Arabians  called  Autei,  and  Gnebadei.  Tro- %0a%3c gloditice,  which  the  Ancients  called  Michoe,  and  others %0a%3c Midoe  :  the  Mountain  Pentedactylos.  Certain  Islands  called %0a%3c Stenae-de'irse ;  and  others  no  fewer  in  number,  named  Halon- %0a%3c nesi :  Cardamine,  and  Topazos,  which  gave  the  Name  to  the %0a%3c precious  Stone.  A  Bay  full  of  Islands,  of  which  that  which %0a%3c is  called  Mareu  is  well  supplied  with  Water  :  another,  called %0a%3c Eratonos,  is  altogether  Dry.  There  were  Governors  there %0a%3c under  the  King.  Within-land  inhabit  the  Candei,  whom %0a%3c they  call  Ophiophagi,  because  they  are  accustomed  to  feed %0a%3c on  Serpents;  and  in  truth  there  is  no  other  Region  that %0a%3c breeds  them  more  than  this.  Juba,  who  seemeth  to  have %0a%3c very  diligently  searched  into  these  things,  hath  omitted  in %0a%3c this  Tract  (unless  there  be  some  fault  in  his  Original),  to %0a%3c speak  of  a  second  Berenice,  which  is  denominated  Pan- %0a%3c chrysos ;  as  also  of  a  third  called  Epidires,  renowned  for  its %0a%3c Situation ;  for  it  stands  upon  a  Neck  of  Land  running  a  long %0a%3c way,  where  the  Mouth  of  the  Red  Sea  is  not  above  Four %0a%3c Miles  and  a  Half  from  Arabia.  There  is  the  Island  Cytis, %0a%3c itself  producing  Topazes.  Beyond  this  are  Woods,  where %0a%3c Ptolemceus,  surnamed  Philadelphia,  built  a  City  for  Hunt- %0a%3c ing the  Elephant,  near  the  Lake  Monoleus,  and  named  it %0a%3c Epitheras.  This  is  the  Region  mentioned  by  me  in  the %0a%3c Second  Book;  wherein  for  Forty-five  Days  before  Mid- %0a%3c Summer,  and  as  many  after,  at  the  Sixth  Hour  of  the  Day, %0a%3c no  Shadows  are  to  be  seen :  which  being  past,  all  the  Day %0a%3c after  they  fall  into  the  South  ;  and  on  other  Days  they  fall %0a%3c to  the  North ;  whereas,  in  Berenice,  which  we  mentioned %0a%3c first,  on  the  very  Day  of  the  Solstice,  at  the  Sixth  Hour,  the %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BOOK  VI.]  History  of  Nature.  155 %0a%3c %0a%3c Shadows  are  wholly  lost;  and  otherwise  there  is  nothing %0a%3c new  to  be  observed  for  the  space  of  600  Miles  about  Ptole- %0a%3c mais :  a  thing  worthy  of  observation,  and  a  place  of  great %0a%3c Curiosity,  that  gave  great  Light  to  the  World ;  for  Erato- %0a%3c sthenes, upon  this  undoubted  argument  of  the  Shadows,  took %0a%3c in  hand  to  deduce  the  Measure  of  the  Earth.  Beyond  this %0a%3c is  the  Sea  Azanium,  and  the  Promontory  which  some  have %0a%3c written  by  the  name  of  Hispalus  ;  also  the  Lake  Mandalum  ; %0a%3c the  Island  Colocasitis,  and  in  the  deep  Sea  many,  wherein %0a%3c are  numerous  Tortoises.  The  Town  Suchse ;  the  Island %0a%3c Daphnis,  and  the  Town  Aduliton,  built  by  Egyptian  Slaves %0a%3c who  escaped  from  their  Masters.  This  is  the  greatest  Town %0a%3c of  Traffic  of  the  Trogloditse,  as  well  as  of  the  Egyptians  :  and %0a%3c it  is  (from  Ptolemais)  Five  Days'  Sailing.  Thither  are  brought %0a%3c very  much  Ivory  and  Horns  of  the  Rhinoceros,  Skins  of  the %0a%3c Hippopotamus,  Tortoise  Shells,  Monkeys,  and  Slaves.  Above %0a%3c are  the  Ethiopians,  called  Aroteres :  also  the  Islands  named %0a%3c Aliseu :  and  Islands  named  Bacchias,  Antibacchias,  and %0a%3c Strathonis;  beyond  them  there  is  a  Gulf  in  the  Coast  of %0a%3c Ethiopia,  as  yet  not  known,  a  thing  to  be  wondered  at,  con- %0a%3c sidering that  Merchants  search  into  remoter  Parts.  Also  a %0a%3c Promontory,  wherein  is  a  Fountain  named  Cucios,  much %0a%3c desired  by  Sailors.  Beyond  it  is  the  Port  of  Isis,  distant %0a%3c from  the  Town  of  the  Adulitse  ten  Days  rowing  with  Oars  : %0a%3c and  thither  is  Myrrh  collected  by  the  Trogloditse.  Before %0a%3c this  Harbour  are  two  Islands,  named  Pseudopylse  ;  and  as %0a%3c many  further  within,  called  Pylse ;  in  one  of  them  are  some %0a%3c Pillars  of  Stone,  engraved  with  unknown  Characters.  Be- %0a%3c yond this  is  the  Bay  Abalites :  the  Island  Diodori,  and  others %0a%3c lying  Desert.  Also  along  the  Continent  there  is  much  Wil- %0a%3c derness ;  the  Town  Gaza  ;  the  Promontory  and  Port  Mossy- %0a%3c lites,  unto  which  Cinnamon  is  brought.  Thus  far  marched %0a%3c Sesostris  with  his  Army.  Some  Writers  place  one  Town  of %0a%3c Ethiopia  beyond  this,  on  the  Sea-side,  called  Baradaza. %0a%3c Juba  would  have  the  Atlantic  Sea  to  begin  at  the  Promon- %0a%3c tory Mossylites  :  on  which  Sea  a  Man  may  Sail  with  a  north- %0a%3c west Wind,  by  the  Coasts  of  his  Kingdoms  of  Mauritania  to %0a%3c Gades :  and  the  whole  of  his  Opinion  cannot  be  contradicted %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 156  History  of  Nature.  [BooK  VI. %0a%3c %0a%3c on  this  point.  From  a  Promontory  of  the  Indians  called %0a%3c Lepteacra,  and  by  others  Drepanum,  to  the  Isle  of  Malchu, %0a%3c he  layeth  it  down  that  by  a  straight  Course  it  is  1500 %0a%3c Miles,  beside  those  Parts  that  are  burnt  up.  From  thence %0a%3c to  a  place  called  Sceneos  is  225  Miles :  and  from  it  to  the %0a%3c Island  Sadanum,  150  Miles :  and  thus  it  is  made  to  the  open %0a%3c Sea  1885  Miles.  But  all  other  Writers  have  been  of  opinion %0a%3c that  there  could  not  be  any  Sailing  on  it,  for  the  exceeding %0a%3c Heat  of  the  Sun.  Moreover,  the  Arabians  named  Ascitse  do %0a%3c much  harm  from  the  Islands  to  the  Trade  :  for  these  Ara- %0a%3c bians join  Bottles  made  of  Ox  Leather,  two  and  two  toge- %0a%3c ther, as  if  they  were  a  Bridge,  and  exercise  Piracy  by %0a%3c shooting  their  Poisoned  Arrows.  The  same  Juba  writeth, %0a%3c that  there  are  Nations  of  the  Trogloditae,  named  Thero- %0a%3c thoes,  from  their  huntings,  of  wonderful  Swiftness :  as %0a%3c the  Ichthyophagi  from  Swimming,  as  if  they  were  Water %0a%3c Creatures.  He  nameth  also  the  Bargeni,  Zagerae,  Chalybse, %0a%3c Saxinse,  Syrecae,  Daremae,  and  Domazanes.  Also  he  affirmeth, %0a%3c that  the  People  inhabiting  along  the  Sides  of  the  Nile,  from %0a%3c Syene  to  Meroe,  are  not  ^Ethiopians,  but  Arabians,  who  for %0a%3c the  sake  of  Fresh  Water  approached  the  Nile,  and  there %0a%3c dwelt :  as  also  that  the  City  of  the  Sun,1  which  we  said  be- %0a%3c fore in  the  Description  of  Egypt,  standeth  not  far  from  Mem- %0a%3c phis, was  founded  by  the  Arabians.  There  are  some  also %0a%3c who  assign  the  further  side  of  the  Nile  to  Africa  and  not  to %0a%3c Ethiopia.  But  leaving  every  Man  to  his  own  Pleasure,  we %0a%3c will  set  down  the  Towns  on  both  sides  in  that  order  in  which %0a%3c they  are  declared.  And  to  begin  with  that  side  toward %0a%3c Arabia,  after  you  are  past  Syene,  is  the  Nation  of  the  Cata- %0a%3c dupi ;  and  then  the  Syenitae.  The  Towns  Tacompson,  which %0a%3c some  have  called  Thatice,  Aranium,  Sesanium,  Sandura, %0a%3c Nasaudum,  Anadoma,  Cumara,  Beda  and  Bochiana,  Leuphi- %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  "  City  of  the  Sun,"  or  Heliopolis.  This  is  the  Egyptian  city,  of %0a%3c which  the  father  of  the  patriarch  Joseph's  wife  was  priest.  It  may  have %0a%3c proceeded  from  the  Arabian  descent  of  the  people  of  this  place,  that  the %0a%3c worship  of  the  sun  was  more  agreeable  to  the  disposition  of  the  minds  of %0a%3c the  inhabitants,  than  that  of  any  of  the  animal  deities,  which  obtained  so %0a%3c much  favour  in  other  cities  of  Egypt.— Wern.

These  were  recorded  until %0a%3c you  come  to  Meroe  ;  of  which  at  this  Day  scarcely  anything %0a%3c is  to  be  found  on  either  side.  The  remainder  is  a  Wilder- %0a%3c ness, by  report  made  to  the  Prince  Nero  by  the  Praetorian %0a%3c Soldiers  sent  thither  from  him  under  the  Command  of  a %0a%3c Tribune,  to  make  Discoveries :  at  the  time  when  amongst %0a%3c his  other  Wars,  he  thought  of  an  Expedition  against  the %0a%3c Ethiopians.  But  in  the  Days  of  Dwus  Augustus,  the  Roman %0a%3c Arms  penetrated  thither  under  the  conduct  ofPublius  Petro- %0a%3c nius,  a  Knight  of  Rome,  and  Prefect  of  Egypt.  He  con- %0a%3c quered all  those  Towns  in  Ethiopia,  which  he  found  in  this %0a%3c order  following;  Pselcis,  Primis,  Aboccis,  Phthuris,  Can- %0a%3c busis,  Attena,  Stadissis,  where  the  River  Nile  casteth  itself %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 158  History  of  Nature.

He  marched %0a%3c forward  a  great  way  into  the  Country,  even  870  Miles  be- %0a%3c yond Syene  ;  but  this  Roman  Army  laid  not  all  Waste  in %0a%3c those  parts.  It  was  the  Egyptian  Wars  that  wasted  Ethiopia ; %0a%3c sometimes  by  Ruling,  and  at  others  by  Servitude ;  it  was  Illus- %0a%3c trious and  Powerful  until  the  Reign  of  King  Memnon,  who %0a%3c ruled  in  the  Time  of  the  Trojan  War,  so  that  Syria  was  sub- %0a%3c ject to  it;  as  also  our  own  Coast  in  the  Time  of  King  Cepheus, %0a%3c as  appeareth  by  the  Fables  of  Andromeda.  In  the  same %0a%3c manner  they  disagree  about  the  Measure  of  Ethiopia.  And %0a%3c first,  Dalion  passing  far  beyond  Meroe ;  after  him,  Arista- %0a%3c creon,  Bion,  and  Basilis ;  also  Simonides  (the  Lesser)  who %0a%3c dwelt  in  Meroe  Five  Years,  when  he  wrote  of  Ethiopia. %0a%3c Timosthenes,  the  Admiral  of  the  Fleet  of  Philadelphus,  hath %0a%3c left  in  record,  that  from  Syene  to  Meroe  is  Sixty  Days' %0a%3c Journey,  without  particularizing  the  Measure.  But  Erato- %0a%3c sthenes precisely  noteth,  that  it  is  625  Miles :  Artemidorus, %0a%3c 600.  Sebostus  affirmeth,  that  from  the  Frontiers  of  Egypt  it %0a%3c is  1675  Miles ;  from  whence  the  last  rehearsed  Writers  count %0a%3c 1270.  But  all  this  difference  is  lately  determined  by  the %0a%3c Report  of  those  Travellers  whom  Nero  sent  to  Discover  those %0a%3c Countries,  who  have  related  that  it  is  862  Miles  from  Syene %0a%3c in  this  manner :  from  Syene  to  Hiera-Sycaminon,  Fifty-four %0a%3c Miles ;  from  thence  to  Tama,  Seventy-five  Miles ;  from  Tama %0a%3c to  the  Euonymites  Country,  the  first  of  the  Ethiopians,  120  ; %0a%3c toAcina,  Fifty-four;  to  Pitara,  Twenty-five;  to  Tergedum, %0a%3c 106  Miles.

They  reported,  moreover,  that %0a%3c about  Meroe,  and  not  before,  the  Herbs  appeared  greener ; %0a%3c and  the  Woods  shewed  somewhat  in  comparison  of  all  the %0a%3c way  besides ;  and  they  espied  the  Tracts  of  Elephants  and %0a%3c Rhinoceroses.

The  Buildings %0a%3c within  the  Town  were  few ;  the  Isle  was  subject  to  a  Queen %0a%3c named  Candaocc*  a  name  that  for  many  years  already  hath %0a%3c passed  in  succession  from  one  Queen  to  another.  Within %0a%3c this  Town  is  the  Shrine  of  Hamrnon  for  Devotion  ;  and  in  all %0a%3c that  Tract  many  Chapels.  Finally,  so  long  as  the  Ethiopians %0a%3c were  powerful  this  Island  was  very  famous.  For  by  report, %0a%3c they  were  accustomed  to  furnish  of  Armed  Men  250,000,  and %0a%3c to  maintain  of  Artisans  400,000.

Beyond  Meroe %0a%3c there  is  a  Country  lying  above  the  Trogloditue  and  the  Red %0a%3c Sea ;  where  Three  Days'  Journey  from  Napata  toward  the %0a%3c Red  Sea,  in  most  places  they  save  Rain  Water  for  their  ordi- %0a%3c nary Use ;  all  the  Country  between  is  very  abundant  in %0a%3c Gold.

But  upon  a  part  of  Africa  are  the  Medimni ;  be- %0a%3c yond then  are  Nomades,  who  feed  on  the  Milk  of  Cynoce- %0a%3c phali :  and  the  Olabi  and  Syrbotae,  who  are  reported  to  be %0a%3c Eight  Cubits  high.  Aristocreon  saith,  that  on  the  side  of %0a%3c Libya,  Five  Days'  Journey  from  Meroe,  there  is  a  Town %0a%3c called  Tole  ;  and  Twelve  Days'  Journey  from  thence  is  Esar, %0a%3c a  Town  of  the  Egyptians,  who  fled  from  Psammeticus.  It  is %0a%3c reported,  that  they  have  lived  in  it  for  300  Years ;  another %0a%3c Town  of  theirs  called  Daronis,  on  the  opposite  side,  on  the %0a%3c Coast  of  Arabia.  But  that  which  Aristocreon  nameth  Esar, %0a%3c Bion  calleth  Sapa;  and  he  saith,  the  very  word  signifieth %0a%3c Strangers  come  from  other  parts.  Their  Capital  City  is %0a%3c within  the  Island  Sembobitis;  and  Sai  in  Arabia  is  the  Third. %0a%3c Between  the  Mountains  and  the  Nile  are  the  Symbari  and %0a%3c the  Phalanges ;  but  upon  the  Mountains  themselves  live %0a%3c the  Asachae,  with  many  Nations ;  and  they  are  by  report %0a%3c Seven  Days'  Journey  from  the  Sea.  They  live  by  Hunting %0a%3c Elephants.  The  Island  in  the  Nile,  of  the  Semberritae,  is %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BOOK  VI.]  History  of  Nature.  161 %0a%3c %0a%3c subject  to  a  Queen.  Eight  Days'  Journey  from  thence  lieth %0a%3c the  Country  of  the  Ethiopians,  named  Nubaei.  Their  Town %0a%3c Tenupsis  is  seated  upon  the  Nile.  The  Sambri,  where  all %0a%3c the  Four-footed  Beasts,  and  even  the  very  Elephants,  are %0a%3c without  Ears.  Upon  the  Border  of  Africa  inhabit  the %0a%3c Ptceambati  and  Ptoemphanse,  who  have  a  Dog  for  their %0a%3c King,  and  they  judge  of  his  imperial  Commands  by  his  Motion. %0a%3c Their  City  is  Auruspi,  far  distant  from  the  Nile.  Beyond %0a%3c them  are  the  Achisarmi,  Phaliges,  Marigeri,  and  Casamarri. %0a%3c Bion  says,  that  beyond  Psembobitis,  there  are  other  Towns  in %0a%3c the  Islands  toward  Meroc,  for  Twenty  Days'  Journey.  The %0a%3c Town  of  the  next  Island  is  Semberritarum,  under  a  Queen ; %0a%3c another  called  Asar  ;  and  there  is  a  second  Island  having  in %0a%3c it  the  Town  Daron ;  they  call  the  third  Medoe,  wherein %0a%3c stand eth  the  Town  Asel ;  and  a  fourth  named  Garode,  as %0a%3c the  Town  is  also.  Then  along  the  Banks,  the  Towns,  Navos, %0a%3c Modunda,  Andatis,  Setundum,  Colligat,  Secande,  Navectabe, %0a%3c Cuini,  Agrospi,  ^gipa,  Candrogari,  Araba,  and  Summara. %0a%3c The  Region  above  Sirbitum,  where  the  Mountains  end,  is %0a%3c reported  by  some  to  have  upon  the  Sea-coast  Ethiopians %0a%3c called  Nisicastes  and  Nisitae,  which  means  Men  with  Three %0a%3c and  Four  Eyes ;  not  because  they  are  so  furnished,  but  be- %0a%3c cause they  are  excellent  Archers.  Bion  affirmeth,  moreover, %0a%3c that  from  that  part  of  the  Nile  which  stretcheth  above  the %0a%3c Greater  Syrtes,  toward  the  Southern  Ocean,  they  are  called %0a%3c Dalion,  who  use  Rain-water  only;  and  the  Cisori  and  Lon- %0a%3c gopori.  Beyond  Oecalices  for  Five  Days'  Journey,  the %0a%3c Usibalci,  Isucles,  Pharusi,  Valii,  and  Cispii.  The  rest  is %0a%3c desert.  But  then  he  telleth  fabulous  Tales  :  as  that  westward %0a%3c there  are  People  called  Nigro2,  whose  King  hath  but  one %0a%3c Eye,  and  that  in  the  midst  of  his  Forehead :  also,  there  are %0a%3c the  Agriophagi,  who  live  chiefly  on  the  Flesh  of  Panthers %0a%3c and  Lions;  the  Pornphagi,  who  Eat  all  things;  the  Anthro- %0a%3c pophagi, that  Feed  on  Man's  Flesh ;  the  Cynamolgi,  who %0a%3c have  Heads  like  Dogs;  the  Artabatitae,  who  wander  about %0a%3c like  Four-footed  Savage  Beasts.  Beyond  whom  are  the %0a%3c Hesperii  and  Peroesi,  who,  as  we  said  before,  are  planted  in %0a%3c %0a%3c VOL.  II,  M %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 1C2  History  vf  Nature.

In  certain  parts  of  Ethiopia %0a%3c the  People  live  on  Locusts  only,1  which  they  preserve  with %0a%3c Salt,  and  hang  up  in  Smoke  to  harden,  for  their  yearly  Pro- %0a%3c vision ;  and  these  live  not  above  Forty  Years  at  the  most. %0a%3c Agrippa  saith  that  all  the  Land  of  Ethiopia,  with  the  Red %0a%3c Sea,  containeth  in  Length  2170  Miles:  and  in  Breadth, %0a%3c together  with  the  higher  Egypt,  1291.  Some  have  taken %0a%3c the  Breadth  in  this  manner;  from  Meroe  to  Sirbitum, %0a%3c Twelve  Days' Navigation  ;  from  thence  to  the  Davelli, Twelve  ; %0a%3c and  from  them  to  the  Ethiopian  Ocean,  a  Journey  of  Six %0a%3c Days.  But  on  the  whole  all  Writers  in  a  manner  agree %0a%3c that  between  the  Ocean  and  Meroe  it  is  725  Miles  ;  and %0a%3c from  thence  to  Syene,  as  much  as  we  have  set  down  before. %0a%3c The  Situation  of  Ethiopia  lieth  South-east  and  South-west. %0a%3c In  the  exact  South,  Woods  of  Ebony  chiefly  flourish  ;  toward %0a%3c the  midst  of  this  Region,  there  is  a  lofty  Mountain  looking %0a%3c over  the  Sea,  that  burneth  continually,  which  the  Greeks %0a%3c call  Theon-ochema ;  from  which  it  is  counted  Four  Days'  Sail %0a%3c to  the  Promontory  called  Hesperion-Ceras,2  on  the  border  of %0a%3c Africa,  near  to  the  Hesperian  Ethiopians.  Some  Writers %0a%3c hold,  that  this  Tract  is  beautified  with  little  Hills,  pleasantly %0a%3c clad  with  shady  Groves,  wherein  are  the  jEgipanes  and %0a%3c Satyri. %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  That  locusts  should  form  a  portion  of  the  food  of  the  people  who %0a%3c live  where  they  abound,  cannot  be  regarded  as  surprising.  John %0a%3c the  Baptist  fed  on  them,  Matt,  iii,  4,  and  Mark,  i.  6.  They  are  still %0a%3c occasionally  used  for  food  in  the  East.  When  Khosru  Purwis  (Chosroes), %0a%3c the  Sassanian  king  of  Persia,  was  summoned  by  Mohammed  to  adopt  his %0a%3c doctrine,  he  contemptuously  dismissed  the  messengers  of  a  chief  of  "naked %0a%3c locust-eaters."  The  Arabs  eat  the  different  species  of  the  migratory %0a%3c locusts,  and  are  very  fond  of  them,  especially  of  the  red  locust,  which %0a%3c when  fat  is  called  Jerdd  rnikken.  They  eat  them  either  fried  or  broiled, %0a%3c or  dried  in  an  oven,  or  boiled  with  a  sprinkle  of  salt ;  the  locusts  taste %0a%3c like  dried  sprats.  The  female  locust  when  fat  and  full  of  eggs,  is  a  great %0a%3c dainty,  and  greatly  esteemed  by  the  male  population  on  account  of  its %0a%3c aphrodisiac  qualities.

Clitarchus  wit- %0a%3c nesseth,  that  report  was  made  to  Alexander  the  King,  of  one %0a%3c which  was  so  rich,  that  for  Horses  the  Inhabitants  would %0a%3c give  Talents  of  Gold  ;  also  of  another,  wherein  was  a  sacred %0a%3c Mountain  adorned  with  a  shady  Wood,  where  the  Trees %0a%3c distilled  Odours  of  wonderful  Sweetness.  Overagainst  the %0a%3c Persian  Gulf  lieth  the  Island  named  Cerne,  opposite  to %0a%3c Ethiopia;  but  how  large  it  is,  or  how  far  off  from  the  Con- %0a%3c tinent, is  not  certainly  known :  but  this  is  reported,  that %0a%3c the  Ethiopians  only  inhabit  it.  Euphorus  writeth,  that  they %0a%3c who  would  Sail  thither  from  the  Red  Sea,  are  not  able,  from %0a%3c the  extreme  Heat,  to  pass  beyond  certain  Columns ;  for  so %0a%3c they  call  the  little  Islands  there.  But  Polybms  affirmeth, %0a%3c that  this  Island  Cerne,  where  it  lieth  in  the  utmost  Coast  of %0a%3c Mauritania,  overagainst  the  Mountain  Atlas,  is  but  Eight %0a%3c Stadia  from  the  Land.  On  the  other  hand,  Nepos  Cornelius %0a%3c affirmeth,  that  it  is  not  above  a  Mile  from  the  Land, %0a%3c overagainst  Carthage ;  and  that  it  is  not  above  Two  Miles %0a%3c in  Circuit.  There  is  mention  made  also  of  another  Island %0a%3c before  the  Mountain  Atlas,  and  which  is  named  Atlantis. %0a%3c And  Five  Days'  Sailing  from  it  are  the  Deserts  of  the %0a%3c Ethiopian  Hesperians,  and  a  Promontory,  which  we  have %0a%3c named  Hesperion-Ceras ;  where  the  Coasts  of  the  Land  begin %0a%3c first  to  turn  about  their  front  to  the  westward,  and  the %0a%3c Atlantic  Sea.  Overagainst  this  Promontory,  as  Xenophon %0a%3c Lampsacenus  reporteth,  lie  the  Islands  called  Gorgates, %0a%3c where  formerly  the  Gorgani  kept  their  Habitation,  two %0a%3c Days'  Sailing  from  the  Continent.  Hanno,  Commander  of %0a%3c the  Carthaginians  (Pceni),  penetrated  to  them,  and  reported %0a%3c that  the  Women  were  all  over  their  Bodies  hairy ;  and  that %0a%3c the  Men  were  so  Swift  of  Foot  that  they  escaped  from  him  ; %0a%3c but  he  placed  the  Skins  of  two  of  these  Gorgon  Women  in %0a%3c the  Temple  of  Juno,  for  a  Testimonial,  and  as  a  Wonder,  and %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 164  History  of  Nature.  [BOOK  VI. %0a%3c %0a%3c they  were  seen  there  until  Carthage  was  taken.  Beyond %0a%3c these  Isles  also  there  are  said  to  be  two  Islands  of  Hesperides. %0a%3c But  so  uncertain  are  all  things  concerning  these  parts,  that %0a%3c Statins  Sebosus  affirmeth,  it  is  Forty  Days'  Sailing  from  the %0a%3c Islands  of  the  Gorgones  along  the  Coast  of  Atlas,  to  the %0a%3c Isles  of  the  Hesperides ;  and  from  thence  to  Hesperion- %0a%3c Ceras,  one.  As  little  certainty  there  is  concerning  the %0a%3c Islands  of  Mauritania.  In  this  only  they  all  agree,  that  Juba %0a%3c discovered  some  few  of  them  over  against  the  Autololes,  in %0a%3c which  he  purposed  to  dye  Gsetulian  Purple.1 %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  XXXII. %0a%3c Of  the  Fortunate  Islands. %0a%3c %0a%3c SOME  Authors  think,  that  the  Fortunate  Islands,  and %0a%3c some  others  besides  them,  are  beyond  the  Autololes  ;  among %0a%3c whom  the  same  Sebosus  spoke  of  their  Distances :  and  parti- %0a%3c cularly that  the  Island  Junonia  is  from  Gades  750  Miles ; %0a%3c and  that  from  it  westward  the  Isles  Pluvialia  and  Capraria %0a%3c are  as  much :  also  that  in  the  Island  Pluvialia  there  is  no %0a%3c Water  but  what  they  have  by  Showers.  From  them  to  the %0a%3c Fortunate  Islands  is  250  Miles  ;  they  lie  eight  Miles  from  the %0a%3c Coast  of  Mauritania  to  the  Left  Hand,  called  the  Coast  of %0a%3c the  Sun,  in  a  Valley,  because  it  is  like  a  Valley  or  Hollow ; %0a%3c and  it  is  also  called  Planaria,  as  resembling  an  even  Plain. %0a%3c This  Valley  containeth  in  Circuit  300  Miles:  wherein  are %0a%3c Trees  so  luxuriant  that  they  grow  to  the  Height  of  144 %0a%3c Feet.  Concerning  the  Islands  named  Fortunate,  Juba %0a%3c learned  by  diligent  inquiry,  that  they  lie  from  the  South %0a%3c near  to  the  West  625  Miles  from  the  Islands  Purpurariee : %0a%3c so  that  to  Sail  thither  a  Man  must  pass  250  Miles  above  the %0a%3c West,  and  then  for  75  Miles  bend  his  course  Eastward.  He %0a%3c saith,  moreover,  that  the  first  of  these  Islands  is  called  Om- %0a%3c brion,  wherein  are  no  Tokens  of  Houses.  Also  that  among %0a%3c the  Mountains  it  hath  a  Marsh ;  and  Trees  resembling  the %0a%3c Plant  Ferula,  out  of  which  they  press  WTater :  that  which %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  On  which  account  in  the  next  chapter  these  islands  are  called %0a%3c Purpurese, — Wern,  Club, %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BOOK  VI.]  History  of  Nature.  165 %0a%3c %0a%3c issueth  out  of  the  Black  Trees  being  bitter,  and  that  from %0a%3c the  Whiter  sort  sweet  and  potable.  He  saith  that  a  second %0a%3c Island  is  named  Junonia,  in  which  there  is  one  little  House, %0a%3c or  Chapel,  made  of  Stone :  beyond  it,  but  near  by  there  is  a %0a%3c third  of  the  same  Name,  but  less  in  size :  and  then  you  come %0a%3c to  one  called  Capraria,  full  of  great  Lizards.  Within  sight %0a%3c of  these  is  the  Island  Nivaria,  which  took  this  Name  from %0a%3c the  Snow  that  lieth  there  continually  ;  it  is  also  full  of  Mists. %0a%3c The  next  to  it  is  Canaria,  so  called  from  the  great  number  of %0a%3c very  large  Dogs,  of  which  Juba  brought  away  two  :  and  in %0a%3c this  Island  there  are  some  marks  remaining  of  Buildings. %0a%3c And  as  all  these  Islands  abound  plentifully  with  fruitful %0a%3c Trees  and  Birds  of  all  sorts,  so  this  is  replenished  with %0a%3c Palm-trees  that  bear  Abundance  of  Dates,  and  likewise  with %0a%3c Trees  that  yield  Pine  Nuts.  There  is  also  great  plenty  of %0a%3c Honey  :  and  the  Rivers  produce  the  Papyrus  Reed,  and  are %0a%3c well  stored  with  the  Fish  Silurus  :  and  in  conclusion  he %0a%3c saith,  that  these  Islands  are  much  infested  with  great  Ani- %0a%3c mals, that  are  very  often  cast  out  in  a  Putrid  Condition. %0a%3c Thus  having  at  large  gone  through  the  Description  of  the %0a%3c Globe  of  the  Earth,  as  well  without  as  within,  it  remaineth %0a%3c now  to  collect  into  a  small  space  the  measure  of  the  Seas. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  XXXIII. %0a%3c %0a%3c A  Summary  of  the  Earth,  digested  according  to  its %0a%3c Dimensions. %0a%3c %0a%3c POLYBIUS  layeth  it  down,  that  from  the  Straits  of  Gib- %0a%3c raltar by  a  straight  Course  to  the  Mouth  of  Moeotis  is  3437J %0a%3c Miles.  From  the  same  starting-place  by  a  right  Course  east- %0a%3c ward to  Sicily,  it  is  1260J  Miles ;  to  Crete,  375  Miles ;  to %0a%3c Rhodes,  146£  Miles ;  to  the  Chelidonian  Islands  as  much ; %0a%3c to  Cyprus,  325  Miles ;  from  whence  to  Seleucia  Pieria  in %0a%3c Syria,  115  Miles.  Which  computation  makes  the  sum  of %0a%3c 2340  Miles.  Agrippa  also  counteth  3440  Miles  for  all  this %0a%3c distance  from  the  Straits  of  Gibraltar  directly  forward  to  the %0a%3c Gulf  of  Issa.  In  which  reckoning  I  scarcely  know  whether %0a%3c there  be  an  error  in  the  number,  because  the  same  Writer %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 166  History  of  Nature.  [BOOK  VI. %0a%3c %0a%3c hath  set  down  the  passage  from  the  Sicilian  Strait  to  Alex- %0a%3c andria at  1250  Miles.  But  the  whole  .  Circuit  through  the %0a%3c above-said  Gulfs,  from  the  point  where  we  began  to  the  Lake %0a%3c Moeotis,  summed  together,  is  15,600  Miles.  Artemidorus %0a%3c added  thereto  756  Miles.  And  the  same  Geographer %0a%3c writeth,  that  with  Moeotis  it  cometh  to  17,390  Miles.  This %0a%3c is  the  measure  of  unarmed  Men,  and  the  peaceful  boldness %0a%3c of  such  as  have  not  feared  to  provoke  Fortune.  Now %0a%3c are  we  to  compare  the  greatness  of  each  part,  in  spite  of %0a%3c the  Difficulty  produced  by  the  Disagreement  of  Authors. %0a%3c But  most  easily  will  this  appear  if  we  join  Longitude  and %0a%3c Latitude  together.  According  to  this  prescribed  rule  the %0a%3c Magnitude  of  Europe  is  8148  Miles.  Africa  (taking  the %0a%3c middle  Computation  between  them  all  that  have  set  it  down) %0a%3c containeth  in  Length  3748  Miles.  The  Breadth  of  so  much %0a%3c as  is  inhabited  in  no  Place  exceedeth  250  Miles.  Agrippa %0a%3c would  have  it  to  contain  910  Miles  in  Breadth,  beginning  at %0a%3c the  Bounds  of  Cyrene,  and  comprehending  in  this  Measure %0a%3c the  Deserts  thereof  as  far  as  to  the  Garamantse,  so  far  as %0a%3c they  are  known ;  and  then  the  whole  Measure  collected  into %0a%3c one  sum  amounted  to  4608  Miles.  Asia1  is  allowed  to  be  in %0a%3c Length  63,750  Miles ;  and  its  Breadth  is  truly  reckoned %0a%3c from  the  Ethiopian  Sea  to  Alexandria,  situated  near  the %0a%3c Nile,  so  that  the  Measurement  runs  through  Meroe  and %0a%3c Syrene,  1875  Miles;  whereby  it  appeareth  that  Europe  is %0a%3c little  wanting  of  being  half  as  large  again  as  Asia :  and  the %0a%3c same  Europe  is  twice  as  much  again  as  all  Africa,  and  a %0a%3c sixth  part  over.  Reduce  now  all  these  sums  together,  and  it %0a%3c will  be  found  clear  that  Europe  is  a  third  part  of  the  whole %0a%3c Earth,  and  something  more  than  an  eighth  Portion  over; %0a%3c Asia  a  fourth  part,  with  a  fourteenth;  and  Africa  a  fifth, %0a%3c with  an  over-plus  of  a  sixtieth  portion.  To  this  Calculation %0a%3c we  will  add  one  sentence  of  Greek  invention,  which  sheweth %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  Pliny's  ignorance  of  the  extent  of  Africa  is  pardonable,  for  he  knew %0a%3c no  more  of  it  than  the  small  portion  which  had  come  under  the  Roman %0a%3c dominion ;  but  in  his  account  of  Asia  he  contradicts  what  he  has  already %0a%3c assigned  to  India,  which  is  only  a  part  of  it,  but  which  he  truly  repre- %0a%3c sented to  be  larger  than  Europe.— Wern.
