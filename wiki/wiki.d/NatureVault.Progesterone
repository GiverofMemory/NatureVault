csum=Progesterone receptors important for antiparasite ability, [[DHEA]] can also activate them [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8000356/|#]]  Progesterone favors [[Th2]] immune response via the progesterone receptor not glucocorticoid receptor [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2526260/|#]].  This means [[apigenin]] might be ideal as I believe it only acts on progesterone receptor.
