PLINIUS   SECUNDUS. %0a%0a%0aFrom  whence  first  arose  all  the  fabulous  Lies,  and  the %0aexcellent  Learning  of  the  Greeks. %0a%0aHE  third  Bay  of  Europe  beginneth  at  the %0aMountains  of  Acrocerannia,  and  endeth  in %0athe  Hellespont.  It  containeth,  besides  19 %0asmaller  Bays,  25,000  Miles.  Within  it  are %0aEpirus,  Acarnania,  ^Etolia,  Phocis,  Locris, %0aAchaia,  Messania,  Laconia,  â€¢  Argolis,  Megaris,  Attica, %0aBceotia.  And  again,  from  another  Sea,  the  same  Phocis %0aand  Locris,  Doris,  Phthiotis,  Thessalia,  Magnesia,  Ma- %0acedonia, Thracia.  All  the  fabulous  Vein,  as  well  as  the %0aillustrious  learning  of  Greece,  proceeded  first  out  of  this %0aquarter;  on  which  account  we  will  therein  stay  somewhat %0athe  longer.  The  Country  Epirus,  generally  so  called,  be- %0aginneth at  the  Mountains  of  Acroceraunia.  In  it  are,  first, %0athe  Chaones,  of  whom  Chaonia  taketh  the  Name  :  then  the %0aThesproti,  and  Antigonenses  :  the  Place  Aornus,  and  Exha- %0alation so  deadly  to  Birds.  The  Cestrini,  and  Perrhoabi,  with %0atheir  Mountain  Pindus  :  the  Cassiopsei,  the  Dryopes,  Selli, %0aHellopes,  and  Molossi,  among  whom  is  the  Temple  of  Jupiter %0a%0a%0aBOOK  IV.]  History  of  Nature.  3 %0a%0aDodonceus,  so  famous  for  the  Oracle  :  the  Mountain  To- %0amarus,  celebrated  by  Theopompus  for  the  hundred  Fountains %0aabout  its  foot. %0a%0a%0aCHAPTER  I. %0aEjjirus. %0a%0aEPIRUS  itself  reaching  to  Magnesia  and  Macedonia,  hath %0abehind  it  the  Dassaretae  above  named,  a  free  Nation;  but %0apresently  the  savage  People  of  the  Dardani.  On  the  left %0aside  of  the  Dardani,  the  Treballi  and  Nations  of  Moesia  lie %0aranged  :  from  the  Front  are  joined  to  them,  the  Medi %0aand  Denthelatse ;  upon  whom  the  Thraces  border,  who %0areach  as  far  as  to  Pontus.  Thus  it  is  environed  with %0aRhodope,  and  is  fenced  presently  also  with  the  Heights  of %0aHaetnus.  In  the  Coast  of  Epirus,  among  the  Acroceraunia, %0ais  the  Castle  Chimsera,  under  which  is  the  Spring  of  the %0aKing's  Water.  The  Towns  are  Maeandria  and  Cestria  :  the %0aRiver  of  Thesprotia,  Thyamis  :  the  Colony  Buthrotium  : %0aand  the  Gulf  of  Ambracia,  above  all  others  most  famous, %0areceiving  at  its  Mouth  the  wide  Sea,  39  Miles  in  Length %0aand  15  in  Breadth.  Into  it  runneth  the  River  Acheron, %0aflowing  out  of  Acherusia,  a  Lake  of  Thesprotia,  36  Miles %0afrom  thence  :  and  the  Bridge  over  it,  1000  Feet  long,  ad- %0amirable to  those  that  admire  all  Things  of  their  own.  In %0athe  Gulf  is  the  Town  Ambracia.  The  Rivers  of  the  Molossi, %0aAphas  and  Arachtus.  The  City  Anactoria,  and  the  Lake %0aPandosia.  The  Towns  of  Acarnania,  called  formerly  Curetus, %0aare  Heraclea  and  Echinus  :  and  in  the  very  entrance,  Actium, %0aa  Colony  of  Augustus,  with  the  noble  Temple  of  Apollo,  and %0athe  free  City  Nicopolis.  When  out  of  the  Ambracian  Gulf %0aand  in  the  Ionian  Sea,  we  meet  with  the  Leucadian  Coast %0aand  the  Promontory  of  Leucate.  Then  the  Bay,  and  Leu- %0acadia  itself,  a  Peninsula,  once  called  Neritis,  but  by  the %0aLabour  of  the  neighbouring  Inhabitants  cut  off  quite  from %0athe  Continent,  but  joined  to  it  again  by  means  of  the  Winds %0a%0a%0a4  History  of  Nature.

Then  the  Cities  of  the %0aAcarnani,  Halyzea,  Stratos,  Argos,  surnamed  Amphilo- %0achicum.  The  River  Achelous  running  out  of  Pindus,  and %0adividing  Acarnania  from  ^tolia  ;  and  by  continual  addition %0aof  Earth  joining  the  Island  Artemita  to  the  main  Land. %0a%0a%0aCHAPTER  II. %0aJEtolia. %0a%0aTHE  ^Etolian  People  are  the  Athamanes,  Tymphei, %0aEphiri,  jEnienses,  Perrhoebi,  Dolopes,  Maraces  and  Atraces, %0afrom  whom  the  River  Atrax  falleth  into  the  Ionian  Sea. %0aThe  Town  Calydon  in  ^Etolia  is  seven  Miles  and  a  half  from %0athe  Sea,  near  to  the  River  Evenus.  Then  followeth  Ma- %0acynia  and  Molychria  ;  behind  which  Chalcis  standeth,  and %0athe  Mountain  Taphiassus.  But  in  the  Borders,  the  Pro- %0amontory Antirrhium,  where  is  the  Mouth  of  the  Corinthian %0aGulf,  not  a  Mile  broad  where  it  runneth  in  and  divideth %0athe  JEtoli  from  Peloponnesus.  The  Promontory  that  shooteth %0aout  against  it  is  named  Rhion :  but  in  the  Corinthian  Gulf %0aare  the  Towns  of  JEtolia,  Naupactum,  and  Pylene :  and  in %0athe  Midland  parts,  Pleuron,  Halysarna.  The  Mountains  of %0aname :  in  Dodone,  Tomarus :  in  Ambracia,  Grania :  in %0aAcarnania,  Aracynthus  :  in  ^Etolia,  Acanthon,  Panaetolium, %0aand  Macinium. %0a%0aCHAPTER  III. %0aLocri. %0a%0aNEXT  to  the  ^Etoli  are  the  Locri,  surnamed  Ozolae,  free  : %0athe  Town  Oeanthe  :  the  Port  of  Apollo  Phastius :  the  Bay %0aCrissaeus.  Within,  the  Towns  Argyna,  Eupalia,  Phsestum, %0aand  Calamissus.  Beyond  are  Cirrhsei,  the  Plains  of  Phocis, %0athe  Town  Cirrha,  the  Port  Chalseon  :  from  which,  seven %0aMiles  within  the  Land,  is  the  free  City  Delphi,  under  the %0a%0a%0aBOOK  IV.]  History  of  Nature.  5 %0a%0aMountain  Parnassus,  the  most  illustrious  Place  upon  Earth %0afor  the  Oracle  of  Apollo.  The  Fountain  Castalius,  the  River %0aCephissus,  running  before  Delphos,  which  ariseth  in  a  former %0aCity,  Liloea.  Moreover,  the  Town  Crissa,  and  together  with %0athe  Bulenses,  Anticyra,  Naulochum,  Pyrrha,  Amphissa,  a %0afree  State,  Trichone,  Tritea,  Auibrysus,  the  Region  Drymaea, %0anamed  Daulis.  Then,  at  the  bottom  of  the  Bay,  the  Angle %0aof  Bceotia  is  washed  by  the  Sea,  with  the  Towns  Siphae  and %0aThebae,  which  are  surnamed  Corsicae,  near  to  Helicon.  The %0athird  Town  of  Breotia  from  this  Sea  is  Pagse,  from  whence %0aprojecteth  the  Neck  of  Peloponnesus. %0a%0aCHAPTER  IV. %0aPeloponnesus. %0a%0aPELOPONNESUS,  called  formerly  Apia  and  Pelasgia,  is  a %0aPeninsula,  worthy  to  come  behind  no  other  Land  for  noble- %0aness ;  lying  between  two  Seas,  ^Egeum  and  Ionium  :  like %0athe  Leaf  of  a  Plane  Tree1,  in  regard  of  the  indented  Creeks %0athereof:  it  beareth  a  circuit  of  563  Miles,  according  to %0aIsidorus.  The  same,  if  you  comprise  the  Creeks,  addeth %0aalmost  as  much  more.  The  Straits  whence  it  passeth  is %0acalled  Isthmos.  In  which  Place  the  Seas  above-named, %0abursting  from  various  ways,  from  the  North  and  the  East, %0adevour  all  the  Breadth  of  it  there :  until,  by  the  contrary %0arunning  in  of  such  Seas,  the  Sides  on  both  hands  being %0aeaten  away,  and  leaving  a  Space  between,  five  Miles  over, %0aHellas,  with  a  narrow  Neck,  meeteth  with  Peloponnesus. %0aThe  one  Side  thereof  is  called  the  Corinthian  Gulf,  the %0aother,  the  Saronian.  Lecheum  on  the  one  hand,  and  Cen- %0achreae  on  the  other,  are  the  Bounds  of  the  Straits :  where %0asuch  Ships  as  for  their  bigness  cannot  be  conveyed  over  upon %0aWaggons,  make  a  great  compass  about  with  some  Danger. %0aFor  which  cause,  Demetrius  the  King,  Caesar  the  Dictator, %0a%0a1  Dionysius,  the  geographer,  also  compares  the  form  of  the  Morea,  or %0aancient  Peloponnesus,  to  the  leaf  of  a  plane-tree,  making  the  footstalk  to %0abe  the  isthmus  by  which  it  is  joined  to  Greece.  And  in  Martyn's  "  Virgil," %0aa  figure  of  this  leaf  is  engraved  to  illustrate  the  subject.â€”  Wern.  Club. %0a%0a%0a6  History  of  Nature.  [BooK  IV. %0a%0aPrince  Caius,  and  Domitius  Nero,  endeavoured  to  cut %0athrough  the  narrow  portions,  and  make  a  navigable  Channel : %0abut  the  attempt  was  unhappy,  as  appeared  by  the  issue  of %0athem  all.  In  the  midst  of  this  narrow  Strait  which  we %0ahave  called  Isthmos,  the  Colony  Corinthus,  formerly  called %0aEphyra,  situated  on  a  little  Hill,  is  inhabited,  three  score %0aStadia  from  each  Shore  :  which  from  the  top  of  its  Citadel, %0awhich  is  named  Acrocorinthus,  wherein  is  the  Fountain %0aPirene,  hath  a  prospect  into  both  those  opposite  Seas. %0aThrough  the  Corinthian  Gulf  is  a  Passage  from  Leucas  to %0aPatrae,  of  87  Miles.  Patrse,  a  Colony,  built  upon  the  Pro- %0amontory of  Peloponnesus  that  shooteth  furthest  into  the %0aSea,  over  against  ./Etolia  and  the  River  Evenus,  of  less  dis- %0atance, as  hath  been  said,  than  a  Mile,  in  the  very  entrance, %0asendeth  out  the  Corinthian  Gulf  85  Miles  in  Length,  even %0aas  far  as  Isthmos. %0a%0aCHAPTER  V. %0aAchaia. %0a%0aACHAIA,  the  name  of  a  Province,  beginneth  at  the %0aIsthmus :  formerly  it  was  called  .ZEgialos,  because  of  the %0aCities  disposed  in  order  upon  the  Strand.

Elis  itself  is  in  the %0aMidland,  12  Miles  from  Pylos.  Within  is  the  Shrine  of %0aJupiter  Olympius,  which,  for  the  fame  of  the  Games  there, %0acontaineth  the  Calendars  of  the  Greeks  (fasti) :  also,  the %0aformer  Town  of  the  Pisaei,  before  which  the  River  Alpheus %0arunneth  ;  but  in  the  Borders,  the  Promontory  Icthys.

Within  it %0athe  Town  Epidaurum,  celebrated  for  the  Shrine  of  JEscu- %0alapius;  the  Promontory  Spirseum,  the  Harbours  Anthedon %0aand  Bucephalus  :  and  likewise  Cenchreae,  which  we  spoke  of %0abefore,  being  the  other  limit  of  the  Isthmus,  with  the  Shrine %0aof  Neptune,  famous  for  its  Games  every  five  Years.  So %0amany  Bays  cut  up  the  Peloponnesian  Coast :  so  many  Seas %0aroar  against  it.  For  on  the  North  side  the  Ionian  Sea %0abreaketh  in :  on  the  West  it  is  beaten  upon  by  the  Sicilian. %0aFrom  the  South  the  Crethean  Sea  driveth  against  it :  the %0a^gean  from  the  South-east,  and  Myrtoan  on  the  North- %0aeast, which  beginning  at  the  Megarian  Bay,  washeth  all %0aAttica. %0a%0aCHAPTER  VI. %0aOf  Arcadia. %0a%0aTHE  midland  Parts  of  this,  Arcadia  most  of  all  taketh %0aup,  being  every  way  remote  from  the  Sea  :  at  the  beginning %0ait  was  named  Drymodis,  but  soon  after  Pelasgis.

And  the %0awhole,  as  if  Nature  weighed  out  a  Recompense  for  the %0airruptions  of  the  Seas,  riseth  up  into  three  score  and  sixteen %0aMountains. %0a%0aCHAPTER  VII. %0aGreece  and  Attica. %0a%0aFROM  the  Straits  of  the  Isthmus  beginneth  Hellas,  by  our %0aCountrymen  called  Graecia.  The  first  Tract  thereof  is  Attica, %0ain  old  Time  named  Acte.  It  reacheth  the  Isthmus  on  that %0aPart  of  it  which  is  called  Megaris,  from  the  Colony  Megara, %0afrom  the  Region  of  the  Pagae.  These  two  Towns,  as  Pelo- %0aponnesus lieth  out  in  Length,  are  seated  on  either  Hand,  as %0ait  were,  upon  the  Shoulders  of  Hellas.  The  Pagaei,  and %0amore  especially  the  ^Egosthenienses,  lie  annexed  to  the %0aMagarensians.  In  the  Coast  is  the  Harbour  Schoenus. %0aTowns,  Sidus,  Cremyon,  the  Scironian  Rocks  for  three  Miles %0along,  Geranea,  Megara,  and  Elcusin.

The  Sea  ^Egeum  took  that  Name  from  a  Rock,  be- %0atween Tenedos  and  Chios,  more  truly  than  from  an  Island %0anamed  MX,  resembling  a  Goat,  and  therefore  so  called  of  the %0aGreeks ;  which  suddenly  riseth  out  of  the  midst  of  the  Sea. %0aThe  People  that  sail  from  Achaia  to  Andros,  discover  it  on %0athe   right   Hand,   dreadful  and   mischievous.     Part  of  the %0a-^Egean  Sea  is  given  to  Myrtoum,  and  is  so  called  from  a %0alittle   Island  which  sheweth   itself  to  them  that  sail  from %0aGerestus  to  Macedonia,  not  far  from  Charystos  in  Euboea. %0aThe  Romans   comprehend   all   these  Seas  in  two    Names  : %0a%0a1  Macron-Tichos. %0a%0aVOL.

Cephalenia,  formerly  called %0aMeloena  is  11  Miles  off,  and  44  Miles  in  Circuit.

In  Times  past  it  was %0acalled  Hyrie,  and  is  22  Miles  distant  from  the  South-coast  of %0aCephalenia.  The  famous  Mountain  of  Elatus  is  there.  The %0aIsland  itself  is  in  Circuit  25  Miles.  Twelve  Miles  from  it  is %0aIthaca,  wherein  is  the  Mountain  Neritus.  And  in  the  whole %0ait  taketh  up  the  Compass  of  25  Miles.

This  lieth  five  Miles  from  the  Promontory  of %0aMalea,  doubtful  for  Ships  to  come  about  it,  by  Reason  of  the %0aStraits  there.  In  the  Argolic  Sea  are  Pityusa,  Irine  and %0aEphyre  :  and  against  the  Territory  Hermonium,  Typarenus, %0aEpiropia,  Colonis,  Aristera  :  over  against  Trcezenium  Ca- %0alauria,  half  a  Mile  from  Platese :  also,  Belbina,  Lacia  and %0aBaucidias.

Next  to  it  is  .ZEgina,  of  free %0aCondition,  17  Miles  off,  and  the  Navigation  of  it  is  20  Miles %0aabout.  The  same  is  distant  from  Pyrseeum,  the  Port  of  the %0aAthenians,  12  Miles,  and  in  old  Time  it  was  usually  called %0aCEnone.  Over  against  the  Promontory  Spiraeum,  lie  Eleusa, %0aDendros,  two  Craugise,  two  Caeciae,  Selachusa,  Cenchreis,  and %0aAspis.  Also,  in  the  Megarian  Bay,  there  are  four  Methu- %0arides.  But  ./Egilia  is  15  Miles  from  Cythera;  and  the  same %0ais  from  Phalasarna,  a  Town  in  Greta,  25  Miles.

Philistides, %0aMallotes,  Crates,  have  thought  it  was  called  first  ^Eria,  and %0aafterwards  Curetis,  and  some  have  thought  it  was  named %0aMacaros,  on  Account  of  the  excellent  Temperature  of  the %0aAir.  In  Breadth  it  exceedeth  in  no  Place  50  Miles,  and  in %0a%0a%0a20  History  of  Nature.  [BooK  IV. %0a%0athe  middle  Part  it  is  broadest :  in  Length  it  is  full  270 %0aMiles :  in  Circuit,  589  Miles  :  and  bending  itself  into  the %0aCretic  Sea,  so  called  from  it,  where  it  stretcheth  out  furthest %0aEastward,  it  putteth  forth  the  Promontory  Sarnmonium, %0aopposite  Rhodos  ;  and  Westward,  Criu-Metopon,  toward %0aCyrense.

In  Times  past  it  was  500  Stadia  long :  but  soon %0aafter,  almost  four  Parts,  which  verged  towards  Boaotia,  were %0adevoured  by  the  same  Sea  :  and  now  the  Towns  remaining %0aare  Julis  and  Cartheea.  For  Coressus  and  Peecessa  are %0aperished.  From  hence,  as  Varro  saith,  came  the  more  deli- %0acate Dress  that  Women  use.  Euboea  itself  hath  been  torn %0afrom  Boeotia,  being  divided  with  so  little  a  Euripus,  that  a %0aBridge  joineth  the  one  to  the  other :  it  is  well  marked  by %0aReason  of  two  Promontories  in  the  South  Side,  which  are, %0aGenestum,  bending  toward  Attica  ;  and  Caphareus  to  Helles- %0apontus  :  and  upon  the  North  Side,  Ceeneus.  In  no  Part  doth %0ait  extend  broader  than  40  Miles ;  and  no  where  doth  it  con- %0atract beyond  20.  But  in  Length  from  Attica,  as  far  as  Thes- %0asalia,  it  lieth  along  Boeotia  for  150  Miles;  and  contained!  in %0aCircuit  365.  From  Hellespont,  on  the  Part  of  Caphareus,  it %0ais  225  Miles.  In  Times  past  it  was  illustrious  for  these %0aCities:  Pyrrha,  Porthmos,  Nesos,  Cerinthus,  Oreum,  Dium, %0a^Edepsum,  Ocha,  CEchalia,  now  Calcis,  over  against  which %0astandeth  Aulis  on  the  Continent  :  but  now  noble  for  Geres- %0aturn,  Eretria,  Carystus,  Oritanum,  Artemisium,  the  Fountain %0aArethusa,  the  River  Lelantum,  the  hot  Waters  called  Hel- %0alopige ;  but  yet  more  known  for  the  Marble  of  Carystus. %0aIn  former  Time  it  was  called  commonly  Chalcodontis  or %0aMacris,  as  Dionysius  and  Ephorus  say  ;  but  Macra,  ac- %0acording to  Aristides :  and  according  to  Callidemus,  Chalcis, %0afrom  the  Brass  there  first  found:  and  as  Mencecmus  saith, %0aAbantias  :  and  Asopis,  as  the  Poets  commonly  name  it.

Varro. %0aMutianus  hath  recorded  that  it  was  twice  shaken.  Aristotle %0agiveth  a  Reason  of  the  Name  in  this  Sort,  because  it  was %0aproduced  and  discovered  on  a  sudden.  jEylosthenes  termeth %0ait  Cynthia  :  others  Ortygia,  Asteria,  Lagia,  Chlamydia, %0aCynethus,  and  Pyrpile ;  because  in  it  Fire  was  first  found %0aout.

In  this  Bay  are  rehearsed  also %0athe  deserted  Islands,  of  which  the  Names  only  can  be  disco- %0avered :  Desticos,  Larnos,  Cyssicos,  Carbrusa,  Celathusa, %0aScylla,  Draconon,  Arconesus,  Diethusa,  Scapos,  Capheris, %0aMesat&,  .ZEantion,  Phaterunesos,  Pateria,  Calete,  Neriphus, %0aand  Polendus. %0a%0aThe  fourth  of  those  great  Bays  in  Europe,  beginning %0afrom  Hellespont,  endeth  in  the  Mouth  of  Mceotis.  But  we %0aare  briefly  to  describe  the  Form  of  the  whole  Sea,  that  the %0aParts  may  be  more  easily  known.  The  vast  Ocean  lying %0abefore  Asia,  and  driven  out  from  Europe  in  that  long  Coast %0aof  Cherronesus,  breaketh  into  the  Land  with  a  narrow %0a%0a%0aBOOK  IV.]  History  of  Nature.  25 %0a%0aPassage  of  seven  Stadia  (as  hath  been  said)  dividing  Europe %0afrom  Asia.  The  first  Straits  they  call  Hellespontus.  Over %0athis,  Xerxes,  King  of  the  Persians,  made  a  Bridge  upon %0aShips,  and  so  led  his  Array  across.  From  thence  is  extended %0aa  small  Euripus  for  the  space  of  86  Miles,  to  Priapus,  a %0aCity  of  Asia,  where  Alexander  the  Great  passed  over.  From %0athat  Place  the  Sea  groweth  wide,  and  again  gathereth  into %0aa  Strait :  the  largeness  is  called  Propontis ;  the  Straits,  the %0aThracian  Bosphorus,  500  Paces  over  :  by  which  Darius,  the %0aFather  of  Xerxes,  made  a  Bridge  and  transported  his  Forces. %0aThe  whole  Length  from  Hellespont  is  239  Miles.  From %0athence  the  vast  Sea  called  Pontus  Euxinus,  and  in  Times %0apast  Axenus,  taketh  up  the  space  between  Lands  far  remote, %0aand  with  a  great  winding  of  the  Shores,  bendeth  backward %0ainto  Horns,  and  lieth  stretched  out  from  them  on  both  Sides, %0aresembling  evidently  a  Scythian  Bow.  In  the  midst  of  this %0abending,  it  joineth  close  to  the  Mouth  of  the  Lake  Mreotis. %0aThat  Mouth  is  called  Cimmerius  Bosphorus,  two  Miles  and %0aa  half  Broad.  But  between  the  two  Bosphori,  Thracius  and %0aCimmerius,  there  is  a  direct  Course,  as  Polybius  saith,  of %0a500  Miles.  But  the  Circuit  of  all  this  Sea,  as  Varro  and %0aalmost  all  the  old  Writers  witness,  is  2150  Miles.  Nepos %0aCornelius  addeth  thereto  350  Miles.  Artemidorus  maketh %0ait  2919  Miles:  Agrippa,  2360  Miles:  Mutianus,  2865 %0aMiles.  In  like  sort,  some  have  determined  the  Measure %0ato  the  Side  of  Europe  to  be  4078J  Miles:  others,  11,072 %0aMiles.  M.  Varro  taketh  his  Measure  in  this  manner :  from %0athe  Mouth  of  Pontus  to  Apollonia,  188J  Miles:  to  Calatis, %0aas  much  :  to  the  Mouth  of  Ister,  125  :  to  Borysthenes,  250  : %0ato  Cherroriesus,  a  Town  of  the  Heracleates,  375  Miles  :  to %0aPanticapaeus,  which  some  call  Bosphorus,  the  utmost  Coast %0aof  Europe,  222 1  Miles  :  the  sum  of  which  makes  1336J  Miles. %0aAgrippa  measureth,  from  Bizantium  to  the  River  Ister,  560 %0aMiles :  to  Panticapseurn,  630  :  from  thence  the  very  Lake %0aMceotis,  receiving  the  River  Tanais  which  runneth  out  of %0athe  Riphaean  Mountains,  is  supposed  to  be  in  Compass  1306 %0aMiles ;  being  the  furthest  Bound  between  Europe  and  Asia. %0aOthers  make  11,025  Miles.

The  Inhabitants  of  that  Bay  have  been  named  in %0athe  mention  of  Thracia,  as  far  as  to  Istropolis.  From  thence %0athe  Mouths  of  Ister.  This  River  riseth  among  the  Hills  of %0aAbnoba,  a  Mountain  of  Germany,  over  against  Rauricum,  a %0aTown  in  Gallia,  and  passing  many  Miles  beyond  the  Alps,  and %0athrough  innumerable  Nations,  under  the  Name  of  Danubius, %0awith  a  mighty  increase  of  Waters,  and  whence  he  first  be- %0aginneth  to  wash  Illyricum  taking  the  Name  of  Ister,  after %0ahe  hath  received  60  Rivers,  and  almost  the  one-half  of  them %0anavigable,  rolleth  into  Pontus  with  six  vast  Streams.  The %0afirst  Mouth  of  it  is  Peuces :  soon  after,  the  Island  Peuce %0aitself,  from  which  the  next  Channel  took  its  name,  and  is %0aswallowed  up  in  a  great  Marsh  of  19  Miles.  Out  of  the %0asame  Channel,  and  above  Astropolis,  a  Lake  is  produced  of %0a63  Miles'  compass ;  which  they  call  Halmyris.  The  second %0aMouth  is  called  Naracustoma :  the  third,  Calostoma,  near %0athe  Island  Sarmatica :  the  fourth,  Pseudostoma,  and  the %0aIsland  Conopon  Diabasis.  After  that,  Boreostoma,  and %0aSpireostoma.  Each  of  these  is  so  great,  that  by  Report %0athe  Sea,  for  40  Miles'  length,  is  overmatched  with  the %0asame,  and  the  fresh  Water  may  so  far  be  tasted.  From  it, %0ainto  the  inland  Parts,  the  People  are  all  Scythians  :  but %0avarious  other  Nations  inhabit  close  on  the  Coasts  :  in  some %0aPlaces  the  Getae,  called  by  the  Romans  Daci :  in  others  the %0aSarmatse,  by  the  Greeks  Sauromatse ;  and  among  them,  the %0aHamaxobii  or  Aorsi.  Elsewhere  the  degenerate  Scythians, %0awho  are  sprung  from  Servants,  or  the  Troglodites  :  presently, %0athe  Alani  and  Rhoxalani.  But  the  higher  Parts  between  Da- %0anubius and  the  Forest  Hercynius,  as  far  as  to  the  Panrionian %0awintering  Places  of  Carnuntum,  and  the  Confines  there  of %0athe  Germans,  the  Fields  and  Plains  of  Jazyge,  the  Sar- %0amatians  possess.  But  the  Mountains  and  Forests,  the  Daci, %0awho  were  expelled  by  them,  inhabit,  as  far  as  to  the  River %0aParhyssus  from  Morus  ;  or  this  is  Duria,  dividing  them %0afrom  the  Suevi  and  the  Kingdom  of  Vanni.  The  Parts %0aagainst  these  the  Bastarnae  hold ;  and  from  thence  other %0aGermani.  Agrippa  hath  set  down  that  whole  Tract,  from %0a%0a%0aBOOK  IV.]  History  of  Nature.  27 %0a%0athe  Ister  to  the  Ocean,  as  amounting  to  2000  Miles,  and %0a400  less  in  Breadth,  from  the  Deserts  of  Sarmatia  to  the %0aRiver  Vistula  :  the  Name  of  Scythae  everywhere  continually %0arunneth  into  Sarmatae  and  Germani.  Neither  hath  that  old %0adenomination  remained  in  any  others  but  those,  who,  as  I %0ahave  said,  live  the  furthest  off  of  these  Nations,  almost %0aunknown  to  all  other  Men.  But  the  Towns  next  to  the %0aIster  are  Cremniscos  and  ^Epolium  :  the  Mountains  Ma- %0acrocrennii :  the  noble  River  Tyra,  giving  Name  to  the  Town, %0awhereas  before  time  it  was  called  Ophiusa.  Within  the  same %0ais  a  spacious  Island,  inhabited  by  the  Tyragetae.  It  is  from %0aPseudostomum,  a  Mouth  of  the  Ister,  130  Miles.  Soon %0aafter  are  the  Axiacae,  named  after  the  River :  beyond  whom %0aare  the  Crobyzi  :  the  River  Rhode  :  the  Bay  Sagaricus,  and %0athe  Port  Ordesus.  And,  120  Miles  from  Tyra,  is  the  River %0aBorysthenes,  and  a  Lake  and  Nation  of  that  Name : %0aand  a  Town  15  Miles  within  from  the  Sea,  called  by  the %0aancient  Names  Olbropolis  and  Miletopolis.  Again,  on  the %0aShore,  the  Harbour  of  the  Achaeans  :  the  Island  of  Achilles, %0afamous  for  the  Tomb  of  that  Man.  And  from  it  135  Miles, %0ais  a  Peninsula,  lying  out  across  in  the  Form  of  a  Sword, %0aand  called  Dromos  Achilleos,  upon  occasion  of  his  Exercise %0athere  :  the  Length  of  which  Agrippa  hath  declared  to  be  80 %0aMiles.  All  that  Tract,  the  Taurisci,  Scythae,  and  Sarmatae %0ainhabit.  Then  the  woody  Region  gave  the  name  to  the  Sea %0aHylaeum,  by  which  it  is  encircled.  The  Inhabitants  are  called %0aEnaecadloae.  Beyond  is  the  River  Panticapes,  which  divideth %0athe  Nomades  and  Georgi :  and  soon  after,  Acesinus.  Some %0asay  that  Panticape,  with  Borysthenes,  run  together  beneath %0aOlbia ;  but  the  more  exact  name  Hypanis  :  so  much  they %0aerred  who  have  described  it  in  a  part  of  Asia.  The  Sea %0aretires  with  a  very  great  Ebb,  until  it  is  distant  from  Moeotis %0awith  an  interval  of  five  Miles,  compassing  a  vast  Space,  and %0amany  Nations.  There  is  a  Bay  called  Corcinites,  and  a %0aRiver  Pacyris.  Towns,  Naubarum  and  Carcine.  Behind %0ais  the  Lake  Buges,  let  out  into  the  Sea  by  a  foss.  And %0a(Buges)  itself  is  disjoined  from  Coretus,  a  Bay  of  the  Lake %0aMoeotis,  by  a  rocky  Back.  It  receiveth  the  Rivers  Buges, %0a%0a%0a28  History  of  Nature.

The  Region  of  Scythia  is  named %0aSendica.  But  in  Carcinites,  Taurica  beginneth  :  which  in %0aTimes  past  was  environed  with  the  Sea,  where  now  there %0alie  Fields  :  afterwards  it  mounteth  up  with  very  great  Hills. %0aThirty  People  are  in  it :  and  of  them  24  are  within  Land. %0aSix  Towns,  Orgocyni,  Caraseni,  Assyrani,  Tractari,  Archi- %0alachitse,  and  Caliordi.  The  Crest  of  the  Hill  the  Scytotauri %0ahold.  They  are  shut  in  Westward  by  Cherronesus  ;  East- %0award by  the  Scythian  Satarchi.  In  the  Coast  from  Car- %0acinites are  these  Towns  :  Taphrae,  in  the  very  Straits  of  the %0aPeninsula  :  then,  Heraclea,  Cherronesus,  endowed  with %0aLiberty  by  the  Romans.  Formerly  it  was  called  Megarice, %0aand  is  the  most  Elegant  in  all  that  Tract,  as  retaining  the %0aManners  of  the  Greeks  ;  and  it  is  encompassed  with  a  Wall %0aof  five  Miles'  extent.

Beyond,  there  have  been %0athe  Towns  Cyte,  Zephyrium,  Acre,  Nymphseum,  and  Dia. %0aAnd  by  far  the  strongest  of  them  all  remaineth  still  in  the %0avery  entrance  of  Bosphorus,  namely,  Panticapaeum  of  the %0aMilesians,  from  Theodosia  1035  Miles  :  but  from  Cim- %0amerum,  a  Town  situated  beyond  the  Strait,  a  Mile  and  a  half, %0aas  we  have  said.  And  this  is  all  the  Breadth  there  that %0adivideth  Asia  from  Europe :  and  even  that  is  for  the  most %0apart  passable  on  Foot,  when  the  Strait  is  frozen  over.  The %0aBreadth  of  Bosphorus  Cimmerius  is  12  Miles.  It  hath  the %0aTowns  Hermisium,  Myrmecium  ;  and  within  it,  the  Island %0aAlopece.

Above %0athem,  the  Nomades  ;  and  then  the  Anthropophagi.  From %0aBuges,  above  Moeotis,  the  Sauromates  and  Essedones  dwell. %0aBut  along  the  Borders,  as  far  as  Tanais,  the  Mceotae,  from %0awhom  the  Lake  was  so  called  ;  and  the  last  behind  them, %0athe  Arimaspi.  Within  a  little  are  the  Riphaean  Mountains, %0aand  a  Country  called  Pterophoros,  for  the  resemblance  of %0aWings  (Feathers1)  occasioned  by  the  continual  fall  of %0aSnow :  a  Part  of  the  World  condemned  by  the  nature  of %0aThings,  and  immersed  in  thick  Darkness,  having  no  shelter- %0aing Places  but  the  work  of  Cold,  the  produce  of  the  freezing %0aNorth  Wind.  Behind  those  Mountains,  and  beyond  the %0aNorth  Pole,  there  is  a  happy  Nation  (if  we  may  believe  it) %0awhom  they  call  Hyperborei2,  who  live  exceeding  long,  and %0a%0a1  "  A  race  of  men  there  are,  as  fame  has  told, %0aWho  shivering  suffer  Hyperborean  cold, %0aTill  nine  times  bathing  in  Minerva's  lake %0aSoft  feathers,  to  defend  their  naked  sides,  they  take." %0a%0aDBTDEN'S  Ovid.

The  snow  does,  in %0afact,  bear  great  resemblance  to  feathers.  I  think,  therefore,  that  the %0aScythians  and  the  surrounding  nations  compare  the  snow  to  feathers. â€” %0aLAURENT. â€” Wern.

The  Region  is  open  to  the  Sun, %0aof  a  happy  Temperature,  void  of  all  hurtful  impulse  of  Air. %0aThe  Woods  are  their  Habitations,  and  the  Groves  where %0athey  worship  the  Gods  Man  by  Man,  and  in  Companies : %0aDiscord  and  all  Disease  are  unknown  ;  and  they  never  die, %0abut  when  they  are  satiated  with  Life :  when  the  aged  Men, %0ahaving  feasted  and  anointed  their  bodies,  leap  from  a  certain %0aRock  into  the  Sea.  This  kind  of  Sepulture  is  the  most  happy. %0aSome  Writers  have  placed  them  in  the  first  Part  of  the  Sea- %0acoast  in  Asia,  and  not  in  Europe;  because  some  are  there  re- %0asembling them  in  manners  and  situation,  named  Atocori ; %0aothers  have  set  them  in  the  midst,  between  both  Suns ;  that %0ais,  the  Setting  of  it  with  the  Antipodes,  and  the  Rising  of  it %0awith  us :  which  cannot  possibly  be,  so  vast  a  Sea  lying %0abetween.  Those  that  have  placed  them  nowhere  but  in  the %0asix  Months'  daylight,  have  written  of  them,  that  they  sow  in %0athe  Morning,  reap  at  Noon,  at  Sunset  gather  the  Fruits  from %0athe  Trees,  and  by  Night  lie  within  Caves.  Neither  may  we %0amake  doubt  of  that  Nation,  since  so  many  Authors  testify, %0athat  they  were  accustomed  to  send  their  first  Fruits  to %0aDelos,  to  Apollo,  whom  they  chiefly  worship.  They  were %0aVirgins  that  conveyed  these  Fruits  ;  who  for  certain  Years %0awere  venerated  and  entertained  by  all  Nations,  until,  upon %0abreach  of  Faith,  they  appointed  to  bestow  those  sacred  ob- %0alations in  the  next  Borders  of  their  Neighbours  :  and  these %0aagain  to  convey  them  to  those  that  bordered  upon  them,  and %0aso  on  as  far  as  to  Delos :  and,  soon  after,  this  custom  wore %0aout.  The  Length  of  Sarmatia,  Scythia,  and  Taurica,  and  of  all %0athat  Tract  from  the  River  Borysthenes,  is  980  Miles,  the %0aBreadth  717,  as  M.  Agrippa  hath  delivered  it.  But  I  judge %0a%0a%0aBOOK  IV.]  History  of  Nature.  31 %0a%0athat  the  Measure  of  this  Part  of  the  Earth  is  uncertain. %0aBut  after  the  appointed  Order,  the  remainder  of  this  Gulf %0amay  be  spoken  of;  and  we  have  already  shewn  the  Seas  of  it. %0a%0aCHAPTER  XIII. %0aThe  Islands  of  Pontus. %0a%0aHELLESPONT  hath  no  Islands  to  be  spoken  of  in  Europe. %0aIn  Pontus  are  two,  a  Mile  and  a  half  from  Europe,  and  14 %0aMiles  from  the  Mouth :  Cyaneae,  of  others  called  Symple- %0agades  :  and  by  Report  of  Fables,  they  ran  one  into  another : %0abecause  they  being  severed  by  a  small  Space,  to  them  that %0aenter  the  Sea  full  upon  them  they  seemed  a  Pair:  but  if %0athe  Eye  be  a  little  turned  aside,  they  made  a  Show  as  if  they %0amet  together.  On  this  Side  the  Ister  there  is  one,  pertaining %0ato  the  Apolloniates,  80  Miles  from  Bosphorus  Thracius  :  out %0aof  which  M.  Lucullus  brought  Apollo  Capitolinus1.  What %0awere  within  the  Mouths  of  the  Ister  we  have  declared  al- %0aready. Before  Borysthenes  is  the  above-named  Achillea,  and %0athe  same  is  called  Leuce  and  Macaron.  This  the  modern %0ademonstration  places  140  miles  from  Borysthenes :  from %0aTyra,  120 :  from  the  Island  Pence,  50.  It  is  in  Compass %0aabout  ten  Miles.  The  rest  are  in  the  Bay  Carcinites :  Ce- %0aphalonnesos,  Rhosphodusa,  and  Macra.  I  cannot  pass  by %0athe  Opinion  of  many  Writers,  before  we  depart  from  Pontus, %0awho  have  thought  that  all  the  inland  Seas  arise  from  that %0ahead,  and  not  from  the  Straits  of  Gades ;  and  they  lay  for %0atheir  argument,  not  without  some  probability,  because  out %0aof  Pontus  the  Tide  always  floweth,  and  never  returneth. %0a%0aBut  now  we  are  to  depart  thence,  that  other  Parts  of %0a%0a1  Apollonia  was  a  colony  of  the  Milesians  in  Thrace,  the  greatest %0apart  of  whose  chief  town  was  situated  in  a  small  island  in  the  Euxine, %0aand  contained  a  temple  dedicated  to  Apollo.  The  colossal  statue  of  the %0agod  which  Lucullus  is  said  to  have  removed  from  thence,  and  placed  in %0athe  Capitol  at  Rome,  is  described  by  Pliny  (lib.  xxxiv.  c.  7),  as  being  30 %0acubits  high,  and  costing  500  talents.

And %0aof  Rhaetia  alone,  the  Breadth  is  almost  greater,  at  least  at %0athe  time  that  it  was  subdued,  and  the  People  departed  out %0aof  Germany  :  for  Germany  was  discovered  many  years  after, %0aand  is  not  all,  even  now.  But  if  it  be  permitted  to  guess,  there %0awill  not  be  much  wanting  in  the  Coasts,  from  the  opinion %0aof  the  Greeks ;  nor  in  the  Length  as  set  down  by  Agrippa. %0a%0a%0aCHAPTER  XIV. %0aGermania. %0a%0aOF  Germans,  there  are  five  Kinds  ;  the  Vindili,  a  part  of %0awhom  are  the  Burgundiones,  Varini,  Carini,  and  Gurtones. %0aA  second  kind,  the  Ingaevones,  part  of  whom  are  the  Cimbri, %0aTeutoni,  and  the  Nations  of  the  Cauchi.

Club. %0a%0aa  Different  suggestions  have  been  offered  in  explanation  of  the  word %0a"  Britannia."  By  some  it  has  been  supposed  to  be  derived  from  the  British %0aword  "  Brithy" â€” painted  ;  from  a  practice  by  the  inhabitants  of  staining %0atheir  skin  of  a  blue  colour  with  woad,  to  render  themselves  formidable  to %0atheir  enemies.  But  a  name  thence  derived  would  only  be  applied  by %0astrangers,  who  would  not  have  selected  a  word  foreign  to  their  own  lan- %0aguage to  express  the  custom.  It  is  more  likely,  therefore,  to  have  been %0aderived  from  a  foreign  source ;  and  it  is  Bochart's  opinion  that  it  was %0afirst  applied  by  the  Phrenicians,  in  whose  language  the  word  "  Baratanac" %0asignifies  the  land  of  tin  :  the  chief  produce  which  tempted  these  adven- %0aturous merchants  to  visit  this  country,  and  make  settlements  in  its  most %0awestern  extremity,  at  a  very  remote  period.  The  word  became  after- %0awards translated  into  the  Greek  name  "  Cassiterides,"  which  was  applied  by %0a%0a%0aBOOK  IV.]  History  of  Nature.  35 %0a%0aRecords.  It  is  opposite  to  Germania,  Gallia,  and  Hispania, %0athe  greatest  Parts  by  far  of  Europe,  and  no  small  Sea  lying  be- %0atween. Albion  was  its  Name,  when  all  the  Islands  were  called %0aBritanniae,  of  which  by  and  by  we  will  speak.  This  (Island) %0ais  from  Gessoriacum,  a  Coast  of  the  Nation  of  the  Morini, %0a50  Miles  by  the  nearest  Passage.  In  Circuit,  as  M.  Pytheas %0aand  Isidorus  report,  it  containeth  3825  Miles.  And  now  for %0aabout  30  Years  the  Roman  Armies  growing  into  further %0aknowledge,  yet  have  not  penetrated  beyond  the  neighbour- %0a%0athe  latter  people,  more  particularly  to  the  Scilly  Islands  and  the  County %0aof  Cornwall.  Albion  was  more  properly  the  Roman  name  of  the  coun- %0atry ;  and  was  probably  derived  from  its  white  appearance,  as  seen  on  their %0aapproach  to  it  from  Gaul.  This  latter  name  was  retained  in  official  docu- %0aments, even  under  the  Saxon  dominion,  as  appears  from  a  charter  of %0aJEthelred  in  the  10th  century;  in  which  he  terms  himself  "  Ego  JEthel- %0aredus,  totius  Albionis,  Dei  gubernante  moderamine,  Basileus :"  and  end- %0aing, "  Ego  JEthelredus  Rex  Anglorum." â€” HEARNE'S  Leland,  vol.  ii. %0a%0aAs  natives  of  the  British  Islands,  we  cannot  but  regret  that,  while  the %0aAuthor  has  been  so  minute  in  the  mention  of  places  lying  round  the %0aborders  of  the  Mediterranean  Sea,  he  has  passed  over  with  neglect  the %0aregions  and  towns  of  Britain  and  Ireland,  as  well  as  those  of  the  north  of %0aEurope.  Although  his  knowledge  of  these  was  probably  limited,  the %0aomission  can  scarcely  have  proceeded  from  ignorance  alone,  for  Suetonius %0ainforms  us,  that  the  Emperor  Vespasian,  who  was  the  great  patron  of  Pliny, %0ahad  subdued  twenty  cities  in  Britain,  together  with  the  Isle  of  Wight ;  and %0awe  cannot  suppose  that  Pliny  remained  unacquainted  with  the  names  of %0aany  of  them.  In  another  place  he  names  Camelodunum,  which  is  be- %0alieved to  be  Doncaster,  as  a  station  sufficiently  known,  from  which  to %0ameasure  the  distance  to  the  Island  Mona,  or  Anglesea ;  and  the  city  of %0athe  Trinobantes  had  been  previously  mentioned  by  Julius  Caesar.  His %0adistribution  of  the  islands  lying  round  Britain  is  contradictory  as  well %0aas  obscure ;  but  he  appears  to  regard  all  that  are  situated  west  of  the %0aordinary  place  of  passage  from  the  Continent  into  Britain,  (Gessoriacum, %0awhich  is  probably  Boulogne  on  the  one  side,  and  the  British  port  of  the %0aMorini,  whether  Dover  or  Folkestone,)  as  being  necessarily  situated  be- %0atween Britain  and  Ireland.  Vectis  is  admitted  to  be  the  Isle  of  Wight ; %0abut  by  some  authors  the  same  name  is  given  to  an  island  to  which  tin %0awas  carried  from  Cornwall  in  carts,  and  from  which  it  was  afterwards %0aexported.  From  a  comparison  of  ancient  authors,  Sir  Christopher  Haw- %0akins was  persuaded  that  this  could  be  no  other  that  St.  Michael's  Mount, %0ain  Cornwall ;  and  the  argument  urged  against  this  supposition,  built  on %0athe  tradition  that  it  once  stood  within  the  land,  and  was  surrounded  by %0a%0a%0a36  History  of  Nature.  [BoOK  IV. %0a%0ahood  of  the  Caledonian  Forest.  Agrippa  belie  veth  that  it %0ais  in  Length  800  miles,  and  in  Breadth  300 ;  and  also  that %0aIreland  is  as  broad,  but  not  so  long  by  200  Miles.  This %0aIsland  is  seated  above  it,  and  but  a  very  short  Passage %0adistant ;  30  Miles  from  the  Nation  of  Silures.  Of  the %0aother  Islands  there  is  none,  by  report,  in  Compass  more  than %0a125  Miles.  But  there  are  the  Orcades  40,  divided  from  each %0aother  by  small  spaces :  Acmodse  7,  and  30  Hsebrides.  Also %0abetween  Britannia  and  Hibernia  are  Mona,  Monapia,  Ricnea, %0a%0aa  wood,  may  be  answered  by  believing  that  these  facts  refer  to  very  different %0aages  of  the  world.  The  Mictis  of  Pliny  may  be  this  Cornish  island ; %0ahis  error  in  the  distance  having  arisen  from  confounding  the  place %0aof  export  for  tin  with  the  islands  producing  it.  To  the  latter,  or  Scilly %0aIslands,  it  appears  the  Britons  were  accustomed  to  sail  in  their  wicker  boats %0acovered  with  leather,  or  coracles  ;  a  mode  of  navigation  perhaps  not  less %0asecure  than  the  somewhat  similar  vessels  at  present  in  use  among  the %0aGreenlanders.  That  they  were  capable  of  a  considerable  voyage  appears %0afrom  the  fact,  that  they  have  been  employed  in  crossing  the  channel %0afrom  Armorica  to  Cornwall  so  late  as  about  the  7th  century.  It  must %0ahave  been  from  misinformation  that  Pliny  assigns  the  Cassiterides  (Chap. %0aXXII.)  to  Spain ;  but  even  this  great  error  may  be  excused,  by  recol- %0alecting that  in  a  preceding  age  the  merchants  had  succeeded  in  concealing %0athe  situation  of  this  Cornish  group  from  the  inquiry  of  Julius  Caesar, %0awhen  he  was  tempted  to  invade  the  seat  of  pearls  and  tin;  and  that %0aCadiz  was  the  Continental  port,  from  which  this  profitable  intercourse %0awith  Cornwall  and  Scilly  had  from  the  remotest  ages  been  carried  on. %0aThe  Islands  mentioned  by  Pliny  may  be  judged  the  following  : â€” %0a%0aOrcades    .        .        .

For  they %0ahave  set  the  Arrotrebae,  whom  we  have  placed  before  the %0aCeltic  Promontory,  in  this  place,  by  exchanging  some  Let- %0aters.

[BooK  IV. %0a%0ahath  written,  that  Lusitania,  with  Asturia  and  Gallsecia,  is  in %0aLength  540  Miles,  and  in  Breadth  526.  But  all  the  His- %0apanise  (Spains),  from  the  two  Promontories  of  Pyrenaeus  along %0athe  Seas,  are  supposed  to  take  up  in  Circuit  of  the  whole %0aCoast  2900  Miles,  and  by  others,  2700.  Over  against  Celti- %0aberia  are  very  many  Islands,  called  by  the  Greeks  Cassiterides, %0afrom  the  plenty  of  Lead  -,1  and  from  the  region  of  the  Pro- %0amontory of  the  Arrotrebae,  six  named  Deorum  (i.  e.  of  the %0aGods)  which  some  have  called  Fortunatae.  But  in  the  very %0aCape  of  Bsetica,  from  the  Mouth  of  the  Strait  75  Miles, %0alieth  the  Island  Gades,  12  Miles  long,  as  Polybim  writeth, %0aand  3  Miles  broad.  It  is  distant  from  the  Continent,  where %0ait  is  nearest,  less  than  700  Paces,2  in  other  Parts  above  7 %0aMiles.  Its  space  containeth  15  Miles.  It  hath  a  Town  of %0aRoman  Citizens,  which  is  named  Augusta,  Urbs  Julia %0aGaditana.  On  that  side  that  looks  toward  Spain,  within %0aabout  100  Paces,  is  another  Island,  3  Miles  long,  and  a %0aMile  broad,  wherein  formerly  was  the  Town  of  Gades.  The %0aName  of  this  Island,  according  to  Ephorus  and  Philistides,  is %0aErythia :  but  according  to  Timceus  and  Silenus,  Aphrodisias  : %0aby  the  Native  Inhabitants,  of  Juno.  The  bigger,  'Timaus %0asaith,  was  by  them  called  Cotinusa ;  our  Countrymen  name %0ait  Tartessos,  the  Pceni  Gadir,3  which  in  the  Punic  Lan- %0aguage signifieth4  the  number  of  seven.5  Erythia  was %0acalled,  because  the  Tyri  were  reported  to  have  had  their %0afirst  beginning  out  of  the  (Red)  Sea,  Erythraeum.  Some  think %0athat  Geryon  here  dwelt,  whose  Herds  Hercules  took  away. %0aThere  are  again  some  who  think  that  it  is  another,  over %0a%0aSee  p.  36,  c.  xvi. %0a%0aLess  than  three-quarters  of  a  mile. %0a%0aOr  Gadiz. %0a%0aSeptem,  or,  as  some  read,  Septum  (i.  e.  a  park  or  enclosure). %0a%0aFrom  the  Hebrew  root  signifying  to  make  a  fence,  the  Phoenicians %0acalled  any  enclosed  space  Gaddir,  and  particularly  gave  this  name  to  their %0asettlement  on  the  south-western  coast  of  Spain,  which  the  Greeks  from %0athem  called  Gaderia,  the  Romans  Gades,  and  we  Cadiz.  See  Bochart, %0avol.  i.  628-734.  This  name  is  very  appropriately  given  to  the  island %0amentioned  by  Pliny ;  but  why  it  should  be  derived  from  a  Punic  word %0asignifying  seven  is  not  so  apparent. â€”  Wern.

Artemidorus  and  Isldorus  have %0aset  down  the  Length  of  it  from  Tanais  to  Gades  84,014 %0aMiles.  Polybius  hath  put  down  the  Breadth  of  Europe, from %0aItaly  to  the  Ocean  1150  Miles,  for  then  the  largeness  of  it %0awas  not  known.  But  the  Breadth  of  Italy  itself  (as  we  have %0ashewn)  is  1220  Miles  to  the  Alps :  from  whence  by  Lug- %0adunum  to  the  Port  of  the  Morini  in  Britain,  from  which %0aPolybius  seemeth  to  take  his  Measure,  is  1168  Miles.  But %0athe  more  certain  Measure,  and  the  longer,  is  directed  from %0athe  said  Alps  to  the  extreme  West  and  the  Mouth  of  the %0aRhenus,  through  the  Camps  of  the  Legions  of  Germania, %0a1243  Miles.

The  Country  Epirus,  generally  so  called,  be- %0a%3c ginneth at  the  Mountains  of  Acroceraunia.  In  it  are,  first, %0a%3c the  Chaones,  of  whom  Chaonia  taketh  the  Name  :  then  the %0a%3c Thesproti,  and  Antigonenses  :  the  Place  Aornus,  and  Exha- %0a%3c lation so  deadly  to  Birds.

On  the  left %0a%3c side  of  the  Dardani,  the  Treballi  and  Nations  of  Moesia  lie %0a%3c ranged  :  from  the  Front  are  joined  to  them,  the  Medi %0a%3c and  Denthelatse ;  upon  whom  the  Thraces  border,  who %0a%3c reach  as  far  as  to  Pontus.  Thus  it  is  environed  with %0a%3c Rhodope,  and  is  fenced  presently  also  with  the  Heights  of %0a%3c Haetnus.  In  the  Coast  of  Epirus,  among  the  Acroceraunia, %0a%3c is  the  Castle  Chimsera,  under  which  is  the  Spring  of  the %0a%3c King's  Water.  The  Towns  are  Maeandria  and  Cestria  :  the %0a%3c River  of  Thesprotia,  Thyamis  :  the  Colony  Buthrotium  : %0a%3c and  the  Gulf  of  Ambracia,  above  all  others  most  famous, %0a%3c receiving  at  its  Mouth  the  wide  Sea,  39  Miles  in  Length %0a%3c and  15  in  Breadth.  Into  it  runneth  the  River  Acheron, %0a%3c flowing  out  of  Acherusia,  a  Lake  of  Thesprotia,  36  Miles %0a%3c from  thence  :  and  the  Bridge  over  it,  1000  Feet  long,  ad- %0a%3c mirable to  those  that  admire  all  Things  of  their  own.  In %0a%3c the  Gulf  is  the  Town  Ambracia.  The  Rivers  of  the  Molossi, %0a%3c Aphas  and  Arachtus.  The  City  Anactoria,  and  the  Lake %0a%3c Pandosia.

The  same,  if  you  comprise  the  Creeks,  addeth %0a%3c almost  as  much  more.  The  Straits  whence  it  passeth  is %0a%3c called  Isthmos.

But  between  Leucadia  and  Achaia  there  are  very %0a%3c many:  of  which  are  Teleboides,  the  same  as  Taphise.:  of  the %0a%3c Inhabitants  before  Leucadia,  they  are  called  Taphias ;  Oxiae %0a%3c and  Prinoessa :  and  before  jEtolia,  the  Echinades,  JEgialia, %0a%3c Cotonis,  Thyatira,  Geoaris,  Dionysia,  Cyrnus,  Chalcis, %0a%3c Pinara,  and  Mystus.

Cephalenia,  formerly  called %0a%3c Meloena  is  11  Miles  off,  and  44  Miles  in  Circuit.  SamÂ£  was %0a%3c destroyed  by  the  Romans  :  nevertheless,  it  hath  still  three %0a%3c Towns :  between  it  and  Achaia  is  Zacynthus,  with  a  Town,  a %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BOOK  IV.]  History  of  Nature.  19 %0a%3c %0a%3c stately  Island,  and  remarkably  fertile.  In  Times  past  it  was %0a%3c called  Hyrie,  and  is  22  Miles  distant  from  the  South-coast  of %0a%3c Cephalenia.  The  famous  Mountain  of  Elatus  is  there.  The %0a%3c Island  itself  is  in  Circuit  25  Miles.  Twelve  Miles  from  it  is %0a%3c Ithaca,  wherein  is  the  Mountain  Neritus.  And  in  the  whole %0a%3c it  taketh  up  the  Compass  of  25  Miles.  From  it  12  Miles  off %0a%3c is  Araxum,  a  Promontory  of  Peloponnesus.  Before  this,  in %0a%3c the  main  Sea,  Asteris  and  Prote.  Before  Zacynthus,  35 %0a%3c Miles  in  the  Wind  Eusus,  are  the  Strophades,  called  by %0a%3c others,  Plotae  :  and  before  Cephalenia,  Letoia.  Before  Pylos, %0a%3c three  Sphagise ;  and  as  many  before  Messene,  called  GEriussae. %0a%3c In  the  Bay  Asinaeus,  three  Thyrides :  in  the  Laconian  Gulf, %0a%3c Teganusa,  Cothon,  Cythera,  with  the  Town  formerly  named %0a%3c Porphyris.  This  lieth  five  Miles  from  the  Promontory  of %0a%3c Malea,  doubtful  for  Ships  to  come  about  it,  by  Reason  of  the %0a%3c Straits  there.  In  the  Argolic  Sea  are  Pityusa,  Irine  and %0a%3c Ephyre  :  and  against  the  Territory  Hermonium,  Typarenus, %0a%3c Epiropia,  Colonis,  Aristera  :  over  against  Trcezenium  Ca- %0a%3c lauria,  half  a  Mile  from  Platese :  also,  Belbina,  Lacia  and %0a%3c Baucidias.  Against  Epidaurus,  Cecryphalos,  and  Pytionesos, %0a%3c six  Miles  from  the  Continent.  Next  to  it  is  .ZEgina,  of  free %0a%3c Condition,  17  Miles  off,  and  the  Navigation  of  it  is  20  Miles %0a%3c about.  The  same  is  distant  from  Pyrseeum,  the  Port  of  the %0a%3c Athenians,  12  Miles,  and  in  old  Time  it  was  usually  called %0a%3c CEnone.  Over  against  the  Promontory  Spiraeum,  lie  Eleusa, %0a%3c Dendros,  two  Craugise,  two  Caeciae,  Selachusa,  Cenchreis,  and %0a%3c Aspis.  Also,  in  the  Megarian  Bay,  there  are  four  Methu- %0a%3c rides.  But  ./Egilia  is  15  Miles  from  Cythera;  and  the  same %0a%3c is  from  Phalasarna,  a  Town  in  Greta,  25  Miles.  And  Creta %0a%3c itself,  lying  with  one  Side  to  the  South,  and  the  other  to  the %0a%3c North,  stretcheth  forth  in  Length  East  and  West ;  famous %0a%3c and  noble  for  100  Cities.  Dosiades  saith  it  took  that  Name %0a%3c from  the  Nymph  Creta,  Daughter  of  Hesperis :  but  according %0a%3c to  Anaximander,  from  a  King  of  the  Curetes.  Philistides, %0a%3c Mallotes,  Crates,  have  thought  it  was  called  first  ^Eria,  and %0a%3c afterwards  Curetis,  and  some  have  thought  it  was  named %0a%3c Macaros,  on  Account  of  the  excellent  Temperature  of  the %0a%3c Air.

The  Mountains  :  Cadiscus, %0a%3c Idaeus,  Dictaeus,  and  Morycus.  The  Isle  itself,  from  the %0a%3c Promontory  in  it  called  Criu-Metopon,  as  Agrippa  reporteth, %0a%3c is  distant  from  Phycus,  a  Promontory  of  the  Cyrense,  225 %0a%3c Miles.  Likewise  to  Capescum  from  Malea  in  Peloponnesus, %0a%3c it  is  80  Miles.  From  the  Island  Carpathus,  from  the  Pro- %0a%3c montory Sammonia,  in  the  Favonian  Wind,  60  Miles.  This %0a%3c Island  lieth  between  it  and  Rhodos.  The  Rest  about  it  are %0a%3c these :  before  Peloponnesus  two  Coricae,  and  as  many  Mylae : %0a%3c and  on  the  North  Side,  with  Creta  on  the  right  Hand,  there %0a%3c appeareth  Leuce  over  against  Cydonia,  with  the  two  Budorae; %0a%3c against  Matium,  Cia:  against  the  Promontory  Itanum  Onisa %0a%3c and  Leuce  :  against  Hierapytna,  Chrysa,  and  Caudos.  In %0a%3c the  same  Tract  are  Ophiussa,  Butoa,  and  Rhamnus  :  and %0a%3c doubling  Criu-Metopon,  the  Isles  called  Musagores.  Before %0a%3c the  Promontory  Sammonium,  Phocse,  Platiae,  Sirnides,  Nau- %0a%3c lochos,  Armedon,  and  Zephyre.

In  Times  past  it  was  500  Stadia  long :  but  soon %0a%3c after,  almost  four  Parts,  which  verged  towards  Boaotia,  were %0a%3c devoured  by  the  same  Sea  :  and  now  the  Towns  remaining %0a%3c are  Julis  and  Cartheea.  For  Coressus  and  Peecessa  are %0a%3c perished.  From  hence,  as  Varro  saith,  came  the  more  deli- %0a%3c cate Dress  that  Women  use.  Euboea  itself  hath  been  torn %0a%3c from  Boeotia,  being  divided  with  so  little  a  Euripus,  that  a %0a%3c Bridge  joineth  the  one  to  the  other :  it  is  well  marked  by %0a%3c Reason  of  two  Promontories  in  the  South  Side,  which  are, %0a%3c Genestum,  bending  toward  Attica  ;  and  Caphareus  to  Helles- %0a%3c pontus  :  and  upon  the  North  Side,  Ceeneus.  In  no  Part  doth %0a%3c it  extend  broader  than  40  Miles ;  and  no  where  doth  it  con- %0a%3c tract beyond  20.  But  in  Length  from  Attica,  as  far  as  Thes- %0a%3c salia,  it  lieth  along  Boeotia  for  150  Miles;  and  contained!  in %0a%3c Circuit  365.  From  Hellespont,  on  the  Part  of  Caphareus,  it %0a%3c is  225  Miles.  In  Times  past  it  was  illustrious  for  these %0a%3c Cities:  Pyrrha,  Porthmos,  Nesos,  Cerinthus,  Oreum,  Dium, %0a%3c ^Edepsum,  Ocha,  CEchalia,  now  Calcis,  over  against  which %0a%3c standeth  Aulis  on  the  Continent  :  but  now  noble  for  Geres- %0a%3c turn,  Eretria,  Carystus,  Oritanum,  Artemisium,  the  Fountain %0a%3c Arethusa,  the  River  Lelantum,  the  hot  Waters  called  Hel- %0a%3c lopige ;  but  yet  more  known  for  the  Marble  of  Carystus. %0a%3c In  former  Time  it  was  called  commonly  Chalcodontis  or %0a%3c Macris,  as  Dionysius  and  Ephorus  say  ;  but  Macra,  ac- %0a%3c cording to  Aristides :  and  according  to  Callidemus,  Chalcis, %0a%3c from  the  Brass  there  first  found:  and  as  Mencecmus  saith, %0a%3c Abantias  :  and  Asopis,  as  the  Poets  commonly  name  it.  Be- %0a%3c yond, in  the  Myrtoom  Sea,  are  many  Isles,  but  those  prin- %0a%3c cipally famous  are  Glauconnesus  and  jEgilia.

The  first %0a%3c of  them,  Andrus,  with  a  Town,  is  from  Gerestum,  10  Miles  ; %0a%3c and  from  Ceum,  39.  Myrsilius  saith  it  was  called  Cauros, %0a%3c and  afterwards  Antandros.  Callimachus  nameth  it  Lasia, %0a%3c others  Nonagria,  Hydrussa,  and  Epagris.  It  lieth  in  Com- %0a%3c pass 93  Miles.

And  Delos  itself,  of  all  others  the  most  illustrious, %0a%3c the  midmost  of  the  Cyclades,  celebrated  for  the  Temple  of %0a%3c Apollo,  and  for  Merchandise;  which,  having  a  long  Time %0a%3c floated  up  and  down  (as  it  is  reported),  was  the  only  Island %0a%3c that  never  felt  an  Earthquake1  unto  the  Time  of  M.  Varro. %0a%3c Mutianus  hath  recorded  that  it  was  twice  shaken.  Aristotle %0a%3c giveth  a  Reason  of  the  Name  in  this  Sort,  because  it  was %0a%3c produced  and  discovered  on  a  sudden.  jEylosthenes  termeth %0a%3c it  Cynthia  :  others  Ortygia,  Asteria,  Lagia,  Chlamydia, %0a%3c Cynethus,  and  Pyrpile ;  because  in  it  Fire  was  first  found %0a%3c out.  It  is  but  five  Miles  about,  and  riseth  up  by  the  Moun- %0a%3c tain Cinthus.  Next  to  it  is  Rhene,  which  Anticlides  calleth %0a%3c Celadussa,  and  Helladius,  Artemite.

Oliatos,  Paros,  with  a  Town,  38  Miles %0a%3c from  Delos,  of  great  Name  for  white  Marble,  which  at %0a%3c first  they  called  Pactia,  but  afterwards  Minois.  From  it %0a%3c seven  and  a  half  Miles  is  Naxus,  18  Miles  from  Delos; %0a%3c with  a  Town,  which  they  called  Strongyle,  afterwards  Dia, %0a%3c soon  after  Dionysius,  from  its  Fertility  of  Vines  ;  and  by %0a%3c others,  Sicily  the  Less,  and  Callipolis.  It  reacheth  in  Cir- %0a%3c cuit 75  Miles,  and  is  half  as  long  again  as  Paros.  And  thus %0a%3c far,  indeed,  they  note  for  the  Cyclades:  the  Rest  that  follow, %0a%3c for  the  Sporades.

Thassos,  a  free  State,  is  from  it  five %0a%3c Miles  :  in  Times  past,  called  JEria,  or  jEthria.  From  thence %0a%3c Abdera  in  the  Continent  is  20  Miles  :  Athos,  62 :  the  Isle %0a%3c Samothrace  as  much,  which  is  free,  and  lieth  before  Hebrus : %0a%3c from  Imbrus,  32  Miles:  from  Lemnus,  22 J  Miles:  from  the %0a%3c Borders  of  Thracia,  28  Miles :  in  Circuit  it  is  32  Miles,  and  hath %0a%3c a  Rising  of  the  Hill  Saoces  for  the  Space  of  10  Miles  :  and %0a%3c of  all  the  Rest  is  fullest  of  Harbours.  Callimachus  calleth  it %0a%3c by  the  old  Name  Dardania  :  between  Cherronesus  and %0a%3c Samothrace  is  Halomesus,  about  15  Miles  from  either  of %0a%3c them :  beyond  lieth  Gethrone,  Larnponia,  Alopeconnesus %0a%3c not  far  from  Coelos,  a  Port  of  Cherronesus :  and  some %0a%3c others  of  no  importance.  In  this  Bay  are  rehearsed  also %0a%3c the  deserted  Islands,  of  which  the  Names  only  can  be  disco- %0a%3c vered :  Desticos,  Larnos,  Cyssicos,  Carbrusa,  Celathusa, %0a%3c Scylla,  Draconon,  Arconesus,  Diethusa,  Scapos,  Capheris, %0a%3c Mesat&,  .ZEantion,  Phaterunesos,  Pateria,  Calete,  Neriphus, %0a%3c and  Polendus. %0a%3c %0a%3c The  fourth  of  those  great  Bays  in  Europe,  beginning %0a%3c from  Hellespont,  endeth  in  the  Mouth  of  Mceotis.  But  we %0a%3c are  briefly  to  describe  the  Form  of  the  whole  Sea,  that  the %0a%3c Parts  may  be  more  easily  known.  The  vast  Ocean  lying %0a%3c before  Asia,  and  driven  out  from  Europe  in  that  long  Coast %0a%3c of  Cherronesus,  breaketh  into  the  Land  with  a  narrow %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BOOK  IV.]  History  of  Nature.  25 %0a%3c %0a%3c Passage  of  seven  Stadia  (as  hath  been  said)  dividing  Europe %0a%3c from  Asia.  The  first  Straits  they  call  Hellespontus.  Over %0a%3c this,  Xerxes,  King  of  the  Persians,  made  a  Bridge  upon %0a%3c Ships,  and  so  led  his  Array  across.  From  thence  is  extended %0a%3c a  small  Euripus  for  the  space  of  86  Miles,  to  Priapus,  a %0a%3c City  of  Asia,  where  Alexander  the  Great  passed  over.  From %0a%3c that  Place  the  Sea  groweth  wide,  and  again  gathereth  into %0a%3c a  Strait :  the  largeness  is  called  Propontis ;  the  Straits,  the %0a%3c Thracian  Bosphorus,  500  Paces  over  :  by  which  Darius,  the %0a%3c Father  of  Xerxes,  made  a  Bridge  and  transported  his  Forces. %0a%3c The  whole  Length  from  Hellespont  is  239  Miles.  From %0a%3c thence  the  vast  Sea  called  Pontus  Euxinus,  and  in  Times %0a%3c past  Axenus,  taketh  up  the  space  between  Lands  far  remote, %0a%3c and  with  a  great  winding  of  the  Shores,  bendeth  backward %0a%3c into  Horns,  and  lieth  stretched  out  from  them  on  both  Sides, %0a%3c resembling  evidently  a  Scythian  Bow.  In  the  midst  of  this %0a%3c bending,  it  joineth  close  to  the  Mouth  of  the  Lake  Mreotis. %0a%3c That  Mouth  is  called  Cimmerius  Bosphorus,  two  Miles  and %0a%3c a  half  Broad.  But  between  the  two  Bosphori,  Thracius  and %0a%3c Cimmerius,  there  is  a  direct  Course,  as  Polybius  saith,  of %0a%3c 500  Miles.  But  the  Circuit  of  all  this  Sea,  as  Varro  and %0a%3c almost  all  the  old  Writers  witness,  is  2150  Miles.  Nepos %0a%3c Cornelius  addeth  thereto  350  Miles.  Artemidorus  maketh %0a%3c it  2919  Miles:  Agrippa,  2360  Miles:  Mutianus,  2865 %0a%3c Miles.  In  like  sort,  some  have  determined  the  Measure %0a%3c to  the  Side  of  Europe  to  be  4078J  Miles:  others,  11,072 %0a%3c Miles.  M.  Varro  taketh  his  Measure  in  this  manner :  from %0a%3c the  Mouth  of  Pontus  to  Apollonia,  188J  Miles:  to  Calatis, %0a%3c as  much  :  to  the  Mouth  of  Ister,  125  :  to  Borysthenes,  250  : %0a%3c to  Cherroriesus,  a  Town  of  the  Heracleates,  375  Miles  :  to %0a%3c Panticapaeus,  which  some  call  Bosphorus,  the  utmost  Coast %0a%3c of  Europe,  222 1  Miles  :  the  sum  of  which  makes  1336J  Miles. %0a%3c Agrippa  measureth,  from  Bizantium  to  the  River  Ister,  560 %0a%3c Miles :  to  Panticapseurn,  630  :  from  thence  the  very  Lake %0a%3c Mceotis,  receiving  the  River  Tanais  which  runneth  out  of %0a%3c the  Riphaean  Mountains,  is  supposed  to  be  in  Compass  1306 %0a%3c Miles ;  being  the  furthest  Bound  between  Europe  and  Asia. %0a%3c Others  make  11,025  Miles.  But  it  is  evident,  that  from  its %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 26  History  of  Nature.  [BooK  IV. %0a%3c %0a%3c Mouth  to  the  Mouth  of  Tanais,  by  a  straight  Course,  it  is  375 %0a%3c Miles.  The  Inhabitants  of  that  Bay  have  been  named  in %0a%3c the  mention  of  Thracia,  as  far  as  to  Istropolis.  From  thence %0a%3c the  Mouths  of  Ister.  This  River  riseth  among  the  Hills  of %0a%3c Abnoba,  a  Mountain  of  Germany,  over  against  Rauricum,  a %0a%3c Town  in  Gallia,  and  passing  many  Miles  beyond  the  Alps,  and %0a%3c through  innumerable  Nations,  under  the  Name  of  Danubius, %0a%3c with  a  mighty  increase  of  Waters,  and  whence  he  first  be- %0a%3c ginneth  to  wash  Illyricum  taking  the  Name  of  Ister,  after %0a%3c he  hath  received  60  Rivers,  and  almost  the  one-half  of  them %0a%3c navigable,  rolleth  into  Pontus  with  six  vast  Streams.  The %0a%3c first  Mouth  of  it  is  Peuces :  soon  after,  the  Island  Peuce %0a%3c itself,  from  which  the  next  Channel  took  its  name,  and  is %0a%3c swallowed  up  in  a  great  Marsh  of  19  Miles.  Out  of  the %0a%3c same  Channel,  and  above  Astropolis,  a  Lake  is  produced  of %0a%3c 63  Miles'  compass ;  which  they  call  Halmyris.  The  second %0a%3c Mouth  is  called  Naracustoma :  the  third,  Calostoma,  near %0a%3c the  Island  Sarmatica :  the  fourth,  Pseudostoma,  and  the %0a%3c Island  Conopon  Diabasis.  After  that,  Boreostoma,  and %0a%3c Spireostoma.  Each  of  these  is  so  great,  that  by  Report %0a%3c the  Sea,  for  40  Miles'  length,  is  overmatched  with  the %0a%3c same,  and  the  fresh  Water  may  so  far  be  tasted.  From  it, %0a%3c into  the  inland  Parts,  the  People  are  all  Scythians  :  but %0a%3c various  other  Nations  inhabit  close  on  the  Coasts  :  in  some %0a%3c Places  the  Getae,  called  by  the  Romans  Daci :  in  others  the %0a%3c Sarmatse,  by  the  Greeks  Sauromatse ;  and  among  them,  the %0a%3c Hamaxobii  or  Aorsi.  Elsewhere  the  degenerate  Scythians, %0a%3c who  are  sprung  from  Servants,  or  the  Troglodites  :  presently, %0a%3c the  Alani  and  Rhoxalani.  But  the  higher  Parts  between  Da- %0a%3c nubius and  the  Forest  Hercynius,  as  far  as  to  the  Panrionian %0a%3c wintering  Places  of  Carnuntum,  and  the  Confines  there  of %0a%3c the  Germans,  the  Fields  and  Plains  of  Jazyge,  the  Sar- %0a%3c matians  possess.  But  the  Mountains  and  Forests,  the  Daci, %0a%3c who  were  expelled  by  them,  inhabit,  as  far  as  to  the  River %0a%3c Parhyssus  from  Morus  ;  or  this  is  Duria,  dividing  them %0a%3c from  the  Suevi  and  the  Kingdom  of  Vanni.  The  Parts %0a%3c against  these  the  Bastarnae  hold ;  and  from  thence  other %0a%3c Germani.

Neither  hath  that  old %0a%3c denomination  remained  in  any  others  but  those,  who,  as  I %0a%3c have  said,  live  the  furthest  off  of  these  Nations,  almost %0a%3c unknown  to  all  other  Men.  But  the  Towns  next  to  the %0a%3c Ister  are  Cremniscos  and  ^Epolium  :  the  Mountains  Ma- %0a%3c crocrennii :  the  noble  River  Tyra,  giving  Name  to  the  Town, %0a%3c whereas  before  time  it  was  called  Ophiusa.  Within  the  same %0a%3c is  a  spacious  Island,  inhabited  by  the  Tyragetae.  It  is  from %0a%3c Pseudostomum,  a  Mouth  of  the  Ister,  130  Miles.  Soon %0a%3c after  are  the  Axiacae,  named  after  the  River :  beyond  whom %0a%3c are  the  Crobyzi  :  the  River  Rhode  :  the  Bay  Sagaricus,  and %0a%3c the  Port  Ordesus.  And,  120  Miles  from  Tyra,  is  the  River %0a%3c Borysthenes,  and  a  Lake  and  Nation  of  that  Name : %0a%3c and  a  Town  15  Miles  within  from  the  Sea,  called  by  the %0a%3c ancient  Names  Olbropolis  and  Miletopolis.  Again,  on  the %0a%3c Shore,  the  Harbour  of  the  Achaeans  :  the  Island  of  Achilles, %0a%3c famous  for  the  Tomb  of  that  Man.  And  from  it  135  Miles, %0a%3c is  a  Peninsula,  lying  out  across  in  the  Form  of  a  Sword, %0a%3c and  called  Dromos  Achilleos,  upon  occasion  of  his  Exercise %0a%3c there  :  the  Length  of  which  Agrippa  hath  declared  to  be  80 %0a%3c Miles.  All  that  Tract,  the  Taurisci,  Scythae,  and  Sarmatae %0a%3c inhabit.  Then  the  woody  Region  gave  the  name  to  the  Sea %0a%3c Hylaeum,  by  which  it  is  encircled.  The  Inhabitants  are  called %0a%3c Enaecadloae.  Beyond  is  the  River  Panticapes,  which  divideth %0a%3c the  Nomades  and  Georgi :  and  soon  after,  Acesinus.  Some %0a%3c say  that  Panticape,  with  Borysthenes,  run  together  beneath %0a%3c Olbia ;  but  the  more  exact  name  Hypanis  :  so  much  they %0a%3c erred  who  have  described  it  in  a  part  of  Asia.  The  Sea %0a%3c retires  with  a  very  great  Ebb,  until  it  is  distant  from  Moeotis %0a%3c with  an  interval  of  five  Miles,  compassing  a  vast  Space,  and %0a%3c many  Nations.  There  is  a  Bay  called  Corcinites,  and  a %0a%3c River  Pacyris.  Towns,  Naubarum  and  Carcine.  Behind %0a%3c is  the  Lake  Buges,  let  out  into  the  Sea  by  a  foss.  And %0a%3c (Buges)  itself  is  disjoined  from  Coretus,  a  Bay  of  the  Lake %0a%3c Moeotis,  by  a  rocky  Back.  It  receiveth  the  Rivers  Buges, %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 28  History  of  Nature.  [BooK  IV. %0a%3c %0a%3c Gerrhus,  Hypanis,  coming  from  different  quarters  :  for %0a%3c Gerrhus  parteth  the  Basilides  and  Nomades.

The  Region  of  Scythia  is  named %0a%3c Sendica.  But  in  Carcinites,  Taurica  beginneth  :  which  in %0a%3c Times  past  was  environed  with  the  Sea,  where  now  there %0a%3c lie  Fields  :  afterwards  it  mounteth  up  with  very  great  Hills. %0a%3c Thirty  People  are  in  it :  and  of  them  24  are  within  Land. %0a%3c Six  Towns,  Orgocyni,  Caraseni,  Assyrani,  Tractari,  Archi- %0a%3c lachitse,  and  Caliordi.  The  Crest  of  the  Hill  the  Scytotauri %0a%3c hold.  They  are  shut  in  Westward  by  Cherronesus  ;  East- %0a%3c ward by  the  Scythian  Satarchi.  In  the  Coast  from  Car- %0a%3c cinites are  these  Towns  :  Taphrae,  in  the  very  Straits  of  the %0a%3c Peninsula  :  then,  Heraclea,  Cherronesus,  endowed  with %0a%3c Liberty  by  the  Romans.  Formerly  it  was  called  Megarice, %0a%3c and  is  the  most  Elegant  in  all  that  Tract,  as  retaining  the %0a%3c Manners  of  the  Greeks  ;  and  it  is  encompassed  with  a  Wall %0a%3c of  five  Miles'  extent.  Then  the  Promontory  Parthenium. %0a%3c A  City  of  the  Tauri,  Placia.  The  Harbour  Symbolon :  the %0a%3c Promontory  Criu-Metopon,  over  against  Charambes,  a  Pro- %0a%3c montory of  Asia,  running  through  the  middle  of  Euxinus %0a%3c for  the  space  of  170  Miles  :  which  is  the  cause  especially %0a%3c that  maketh  the  Form  abovesaid  of  a  Scythian  Bow.  Near %0a%3c to  it  are  many  Harbours  and  Lakes  of  the  Tauri.  The %0a%3c Town  Theodosia,  distant  from  Criu-Metopon  122  Miles,  and %0a%3c from  Cherronesus  165  Miles.  Beyond,  there  have  been %0a%3c the  Towns  Cyte,  Zephyrium,  Acre,  Nymphseum,  and  Dia. %0a%3c And  by  far  the  strongest  of  them  all  remaineth  still  in  the %0a%3c very  entrance  of  Bosphorus,  namely,  Panticapaeum  of  the %0a%3c Milesians,  from  Theodosia  1035  Miles  :  but  from  Cim- %0a%3c merum,  a  Town  situated  beyond  the  Strait,  a  Mile  and  a  half, %0a%3c as  we  have  said.  And  this  is  all  the  Breadth  there  that %0a%3c divideth  Asia  from  Europe :  and  even  that  is  for  the  most %0a%3c part  passable  on  Foot,  when  the  Strait  is  frozen  over.  The %0a%3c Breadth  of  Bosphorus  Cimmerius  is  12  Miles.  It  hath  the %0a%3c Towns  Hermisium,  Myrmecium  ;  and  within  it,  the  Island %0a%3c Alopece.

From  Taphrae,  the %0a%3c Continent  within  is  inhabited  by  the  Anchetae,  among  whom %0a%3c the  Hypanis  springeth  :  and  Neuri,  where  Borysthenes  hath %0a%3c his  Head ;  also,  the  Geloni,  Thussagetae,  Budmi,  Basilidae, %0a%3c and  the  Agathyrsi,  with  blue  Hair  on  their  Heads.  Above %0a%3c them,  the  Nomades  ;  and  then  the  Anthropophagi.  From %0a%3c Buges,  above  Moeotis,  the  Sauromates  and  Essedones  dwell. %0a%3c But  along  the  Borders,  as  far  as  Tanais,  the  Mceotae,  from %0a%3c whom  the  Lake  was  so  called  ;  and  the  last  behind  them, %0a%3c the  Arimaspi.  Within  a  little  are  the  Riphaean  Mountains, %0a%3c and  a  Country  called  Pterophoros,  for  the  resemblance  of %0a%3c Wings  (Feathers1)  occasioned  by  the  continual  fall  of %0a%3c Snow :  a  Part  of  the  World  condemned  by  the  nature  of %0a%3c Things,  and  immersed  in  thick  Darkness,  having  no  shelter- %0a%3c ing Places  but  the  work  of  Cold,  the  produce  of  the  freezing %0a%3c North  Wind.  Behind  those  Mountains,  and  beyond  the %0a%3c North  Pole,  there  is  a  happy  Nation  (if  we  may  believe  it) %0a%3c whom  they  call  Hyperborei2,  who  live  exceeding  long,  and %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  "  A  race  of  men  there  are,  as  fame  has  told, %0a%3c Who  shivering  suffer  Hyperborean  cold, %0a%3c Till  nine  times  bathing  in  Minerva's  lake %0a%3c Soft  feathers,  to  defend  their  naked  sides,  they  take." %0a%3c %0a%3c DBTDEN'S  Ovid.

The  snow  does,  in %0a%3c fact,  bear  great  resemblance  to  feathers.  I  think,  therefore,  that  the %0a%3c Scythians  and  the  surrounding  nations  compare  the  snow  to  feathers. â€” %0a%3c LAURENT. â€” Wern.

They  had,  indeed,  but %0a%3c very  little  acquaintance  with  these  regions ;  and  all  they  tell  us  of  them %0a%3c is  very  precarious,  while  much  of  it  is  false.

There  are  believed  to %0a%3c be  the  Poles  of  the  World,  and  the  very  Ends  of  the  revo- %0a%3c lution of  the  Heavens,  having  for  six  Months  together  one %0a%3c entire  Day  ;  and  Night  as  long,  when  the  Sun  is  turned  from %0a%3c them :  but  their  Day  is  not  from  the  Spring  Equinox  (as %0a%3c the  Ignorant  say)  to  the  Autumn  :  for  once  in  the  Year,  at %0a%3c the  Solstice,  the  Sun  riseth  with  them :  and  once  likewise %0a%3c it  setteth  in  Mid-winter.  The  Region  is  open  to  the  Sun, %0a%3c of  a  happy  Temperature,  void  of  all  hurtful  impulse  of  Air. %0a%3c The  Woods  are  their  Habitations,  and  the  Groves  where %0a%3c they  worship  the  Gods  Man  by  Man,  and  in  Companies : %0a%3c Discord  and  all  Disease  are  unknown  ;  and  they  never  die, %0a%3c but  when  they  are  satiated  with  Life :  when  the  aged  Men, %0a%3c having  feasted  and  anointed  their  bodies,  leap  from  a  certain %0a%3c Rock  into  the  Sea.  This  kind  of  Sepulture  is  the  most  happy. %0a%3c Some  Writers  have  placed  them  in  the  first  Part  of  the  Sea- %0a%3c coast  in  Asia,  and  not  in  Europe;  because  some  are  there  re- %0a%3c sembling them  in  manners  and  situation,  named  Atocori ; %0a%3c others  have  set  them  in  the  midst,  between  both  Suns ;  that %0a%3c is,  the  Setting  of  it  with  the  Antipodes,  and  the  Rising  of  it %0a%3c with  us :  which  cannot  possibly  be,  so  vast  a  Sea  lying %0a%3c between.  Those  that  have  placed  them  nowhere  but  in  the %0a%3c six  Months'  daylight,  have  written  of  them,  that  they  sow  in %0a%3c the  Morning,  reap  at  Noon,  at  Sunset  gather  the  Fruits  from %0a%3c the  Trees,  and  by  Night  lie  within  Caves.  Neither  may  we %0a%3c make  doubt  of  that  Nation,  since  so  many  Authors  testify, %0a%3c that  they  were  accustomed  to  send  their  first  Fruits  to %0a%3c Delos,  to  Apollo,  whom  they  chiefly  worship.  They  were %0a%3c Virgins  that  conveyed  these  Fruits  ;  who  for  certain  Years %0a%3c were  venerated  and  entertained  by  all  Nations,  until,  upon %0a%3c breach  of  Faith,  they  appointed  to  bestow  those  sacred  ob- %0a%3c lations in  the  next  Borders  of  their  Neighbours  :  and  these %0a%3c again  to  convey  them  to  those  that  bordered  upon  them,  and %0a%3c so  on  as  far  as  to  Delos :  and,  soon  after,  this  custom  wore %0a%3c out.  The  Length  of  Sarmatia,  Scythia,  and  Taurica,  and  of  all %0a%3c that  Tract  from  the  River  Borysthenes,  is  980  Miles,  the %0a%3c Breadth  717,  as  M.  Agrippa  hath  delivered  it.  But  I  judge %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BOOK  IV.]  History  of  Nature.  31 %0a%3c %0a%3c that  the  Measure  of  this  Part  of  the  Earth  is  uncertain. %0a%3c But  after  the  appointed  Order,  the  remainder  of  this  Gulf %0a%3c may  be  spoken  of;  and  we  have  already  shewn  the  Seas  of  it. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  XIII. %0a%3c The  Islands  of  Pontus. %0a%3c %0a%3c HELLESPONT  hath  no  Islands  to  be  spoken  of  in  Europe. %0a%3c In  Pontus  are  two,  a  Mile  and  a  half  from  Europe,  and  14 %0a%3c Miles  from  the  Mouth :  Cyaneae,  of  others  called  Symple- %0a%3c gades  :  and  by  Report  of  Fables,  they  ran  one  into  another : %0a%3c because  they  being  severed  by  a  small  Space,  to  them  that %0a%3c enter  the  Sea  full  upon  them  they  seemed  a  Pair:  but  if %0a%3c the  Eye  be  a  little  turned  aside,  they  made  a  Show  as  if  they %0a%3c met  together.  On  this  Side  the  Ister  there  is  one,  pertaining %0a%3c to  the  Apolloniates,  80  Miles  from  Bosphorus  Thracius  :  out %0a%3c of  which  M.  Lucullus  brought  Apollo  Capitolinus1.  What %0a%3c were  within  the  Mouths  of  the  Ister  we  have  declared  al- %0a%3c ready. Before  Borysthenes  is  the  above-named  Achillea,  and %0a%3c the  same  is  called  Leuce  and  Macaron.  This  the  modern %0a%3c demonstration  places  140  miles  from  Borysthenes :  from %0a%3c Tyra,  120 :  from  the  Island  Pence,  50.  It  is  in  Compass %0a%3c about  ten  Miles.  The  rest  are  in  the  Bay  Carcinites :  Ce- %0a%3c phalonnesos,  Rhosphodusa,  and  Macra.  I  cannot  pass  by %0a%3c the  Opinion  of  many  Writers,  before  we  depart  from  Pontus, %0a%3c who  have  thought  that  all  the  inland  Seas  arise  from  that %0a%3c head,  and  not  from  the  Straits  of  Gades ;  and  they  lay  for %0a%3c their  argument,  not  without  some  probability,  because  out %0a%3c of  Pontus  the  Tide  always  floweth,  and  never  returneth. %0a%3c %0a%3c But  now  we  are  to  depart  thence,  that  other  Parts  of %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  Apollonia  was  a  colony  of  the  Milesians  in  Thrace,  the  greatest %0a%3c part  of  whose  chief  town  was  situated  in  a  small  island  in  the  Euxine, %0a%3c and  contained  a  temple  dedicated  to  Apollo.  The  colossal  statue  of  the %0a%3c god  which  Lucullus  is  said  to  have  removed  from  thence,  and  placed  in %0a%3c the  Capitol  at  Rome,  is  described  by  Pliny  (lib.  xxxiv.  c.  7),  as  being  30 %0a%3c cubits  high,  and  costing  500  talents.  After  its  removal,  it  acquired  the %0a%3c name  of  Apollo  Capitolinus. â€” (Note.  HOLLAND'S  Translation  says  150 %0a%3c talents  only.) â€” Wem.

In  which %0a%3c Tract  there  are  reported  to  be  very  many  Islands  without %0a%3c Names,  of  which,  by  the  Report  of  Tim&us,  there  is  one  be- %0a%3c fore Scythia  called  Bannomanna,  distant  from  Scythia  one %0a%3c Day's  Sailing,  into  which,  in  the  Time  of  Spring,  Amber  is %0a%3c cast  up  by  the  Waves.

The  same  doth  Pythias  name  Basilia. %0a%3c There  are  reported  the  Isles  Oonae,  wherein  the  Inhabitants %0a%3c live  on  Birds'  Eggs  and  Oats.  Others  also,  wherein  men %0a%3c are  born  with  the  Feet  of  Horses,  and  called  Hippopodes. %0a%3c Others  of  the  Panoti1,  who,  being  otherwise  naked,  have %0a%3c immensely  great  Ears  that  cover  their  whole  Bodies.  Then %0a%3c begins  a  clearer  Report  to  open  from  the  Nation  of  the %0a%3c Ingevoni,  the  first  of  the  Germans  in  those  Parts.  There  is %0a%3c the  exceeding  great  Mountain  Sevo,  not  inferior  to  the  high %0a%3c Crags  of  Riphaeus,  which  maketh  a  very  large  Gulf,  as  far %0a%3c as  to  the  Cimbrians'  Promontory,  called  Codanus,  and  it  is %0a%3c full  of  Islands,  of  which  the  most  celebrated  is  Scandinavia, %0a%3c the  Magnitude  whereof  is  not  yet  discovered.

Along  this  Sea,  until  you  come  to  the  River  Scaldis, %0a%3c the  German  Nations  inhabit :  but  the  Measure  of  that  Tract %0a%3c can  scarcely  be  declared,  such  very  great  Discord  there %0a%3c is  among  Writers.  The  Greeks  and  some  of  our  own  Writers %0a%3c have  described  the  Coast  of  Germany  to  be  2500  Miles. %0a%3c Agrippa  again,  joining  with  it  Rhaetia  and  Noricum,  saith, %0a%3c that  it  is  in  Length  686  miles,  and  in  Breadth  268.  And %0a%3c of  Rhaetia  alone,  the  Breadth  is  almost  greater,  at  least  at %0a%3c the  time  that  it  was  subdued,  and  the  People  departed  out %0a%3c of  Germany  :  for  Germany  was  discovered  many  years  after, %0a%3c and  is  not  all,  even  now.

Club. %0a%3c %0a%3c a  Different  suggestions  have  been  offered  in  explanation  of  the  word %0a%3c "  Britannia."  By  some  it  has  been  supposed  to  be  derived  from  the  British %0a%3c word  "  Brithy" â€” painted  ;  from  a  practice  by  the  inhabitants  of  staining %0a%3c their  skin  of  a  blue  colour  with  woad,  to  render  themselves  formidable  to %0a%3c their  enemies.  But  a  name  thence  derived  would  only  be  applied  by %0a%3c strangers,  who  would  not  have  selected  a  word  foreign  to  their  own  lan- %0a%3c guage to  express  the  custom.  It  is  more  likely,  therefore,  to  have  been %0a%3c derived  from  a  foreign  source ;  and  it  is  Bochart's  opinion  that  it  was %0a%3c first  applied  by  the  Phrenicians,  in  whose  language  the  word  "  Baratanac" %0a%3c signifies  the  land  of  tin  :  the  chief  produce  which  tempted  these  adven- %0a%3c turous merchants  to  visit  this  country,  and  make  settlements  in  its  most %0a%3c western  extremity,  at  a  very  remote  period.  The  word  became  after- %0a%3c wards translated  into  the  Greek  name  "  Cassiterides,"  which  was  applied  by %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BOOK  IV.]  History  of  Nature.  35 %0a%3c %0a%3c Records.  It  is  opposite  to  Germania,  Gallia,  and  Hispania, %0a%3c the  greatest  Parts  by  far  of  Europe,  and  no  small  Sea  lying  be- %0a%3c tween. Albion  was  its  Name,  when  all  the  Islands  were  called %0a%3c Britanniae,  of  which  by  and  by  we  will  speak.  This  (Island) %0a%3c is  from  Gessoriacum,  a  Coast  of  the  Nation  of  the  Morini, %0a%3c 50  Miles  by  the  nearest  Passage.  In  Circuit,  as  M.  Pytheas %0a%3c and  Isidorus  report,  it  containeth  3825  Miles.  And  now  for %0a%3c about  30  Years  the  Roman  Armies  growing  into  further %0a%3c knowledge,  yet  have  not  penetrated  beyond  the  neighbour- %0a%3c %0a%3c the  latter  people,  more  particularly  to  the  Scilly  Islands  and  the  County %0a%3c of  Cornwall.  Albion  was  more  properly  the  Roman  name  of  the  coun- %0a%3c try ;  and  was  probably  derived  from  its  white  appearance,  as  seen  on  their %0a%3c approach  to  it  from  Gaul.  This  latter  name  was  retained  in  official  docu- %0a%3c ments, even  under  the  Saxon  dominion,  as  appears  from  a  charter  of %0a%3c JEthelred  in  the  10th  century;  in  which  he  terms  himself  "  Ego  JEthel- %0a%3c redus,  totius  Albionis,  Dei  gubernante  moderamine,  Basileus :"  and  end- %0a%3c ing, "  Ego  JEthelredus  Rex  Anglorum." â€” HEARNE'S  Leland,  vol.  ii. %0a%3c %0a%3c As  natives  of  the  British  Islands,  we  cannot  but  regret  that,  while  the %0a%3c Author  has  been  so  minute  in  the  mention  of  places  lying  round  the %0a%3c borders  of  the  Mediterranean  Sea,  he  has  passed  over  with  neglect  the %0a%3c regions  and  towns  of  Britain  and  Ireland,  as  well  as  those  of  the  north  of %0a%3c Europe.  Although  his  knowledge  of  these  was  probably  limited,  the %0a%3c omission  can  scarcely  have  proceeded  from  ignorance  alone,  for  Suetonius %0a%3c informs  us,  that  the  Emperor  Vespasian,  who  was  the  great  patron  of  Pliny, %0a%3c had  subdued  twenty  cities  in  Britain,  together  with  the  Isle  of  Wight ;  and %0a%3c we  cannot  suppose  that  Pliny  remained  unacquainted  with  the  names  of %0a%3c any  of  them.  In  another  place  he  names  Camelodunum,  which  is  be- %0a%3c lieved to  be  Doncaster,  as  a  station  sufficiently  known,  from  which  to %0a%3c measure  the  distance  to  the  Island  Mona,  or  Anglesea ;  and  the  city  of %0a%3c the  Trinobantes  had  been  previously  mentioned  by  Julius  Caesar.  His %0a%3c distribution  of  the  islands  lying  round  Britain  is  contradictory  as  well %0a%3c as  obscure ;  but  he  appears  to  regard  all  that  are  situated  west  of  the %0a%3c ordinary  place  of  passage  from  the  Continent  into  Britain,  (Gessoriacum, %0a%3c which  is  probably  Boulogne  on  the  one  side,  and  the  British  port  of  the %0a%3c Morini,  whether  Dover  or  Folkestone,)  as  being  necessarily  situated  be- %0a%3c tween Britain  and  Ireland.  Vectis  is  admitted  to  be  the  Isle  of  Wight ; %0a%3c but  by  some  authors  the  same  name  is  given  to  an  island  to  which  tin %0a%3c was  carried  from  Cornwall  in  carts,  and  from  which  it  was  afterwards %0a%3c exported.  From  a  comparison  of  ancient  authors,  Sir  Christopher  Haw- %0a%3c kins was  persuaded  that  this  could  be  no  other  that  St.  Michael's  Mount, %0a%3c in  Cornwall ;  and  the  argument  urged  against  this  supposition,  built  on %0a%3c the  tradition  that  it  once  stood  within  the  land,  and  was  surrounded  by %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 36  History  of  Nature.

Agrippa  belie  veth  that  it %0a%3c is  in  Length  800  miles,  and  in  Breadth  300 ;  and  also  that %0a%3c Ireland  is  as  broad,  but  not  so  long  by  200  Miles.  This %0a%3c Island  is  seated  above  it,  and  but  a  very  short  Passage %0a%3c distant ;  30  Miles  from  the  Nation  of  Silures.  Of  the %0a%3c other  Islands  there  is  none,  by  report,  in  Compass  more  than %0a%3c 125  Miles.  But  there  are  the  Orcades  40,  divided  from  each %0a%3c other  by  small  spaces :  Acmodse  7,  and  30  Hsebrides.  Also %0a%3c between  Britannia  and  Hibernia  are  Mona,  Monapia,  Ricnea, %0a%3c %0a%3c a  wood,  may  be  answered  by  believing  that  these  facts  refer  to  very  different %0a%3c ages  of  the  world.  The  Mictis  of  Pliny  may  be  this  Cornish  island ; %0a%3c his  error  in  the  distance  having  arisen  from  confounding  the  place %0a%3c of  export  for  tin  with  the  islands  producing  it.  To  the  latter,  or  Scilly %0a%3c Islands,  it  appears  the  Britons  were  accustomed  to  sail  in  their  wicker  boats %0a%3c covered  with  leather,  or  coracles  ;  a  mode  of  navigation  perhaps  not  less %0a%3c secure  than  the  somewhat  similar  vessels  at  present  in  use  among  the %0a%3c Greenlanders.  That  they  were  capable  of  a  considerable  voyage  appears %0a%3c from  the  fact,  that  they  have  been  employed  in  crossing  the  channel %0a%3c from  Armorica  to  Cornwall  so  late  as  about  the  7th  century.  It  must %0a%3c have  been  from  misinformation  that  Pliny  assigns  the  Cassiterides  (Chap. %0a%3c XXII.)  to  Spain ;  but  even  this  great  error  may  be  excused,  by  recol- %0a%3c lecting that  in  a  preceding  age  the  merchants  had  succeeded  in  concealing %0a%3c the  situation  of  this  Cornish  group  from  the  inquiry  of  Julius  Caesar, %0a%3c when  he  was  tempted  to  invade  the  seat  of  pearls  and  tin;  and  that %0a%3c Cadiz  was  the  Continental  port,  from  which  this  profitable  intercourse %0a%3c with  Cornwall  and  Scilly  had  from  the  remotest  ages  been  carried  on. %0a%3c The  Islands  mentioned  by  Pliny  may  be  judged  the  following  : â€” %0a%3c %0a%3c Orcades    .        .        .

Within  one  Day's  Sail  from  Thule  is  the  Frozen %0a%3c Sea,  named  by  some  Cronium. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  XVII. %0a%3c Gallia. %0a%3c %0a%3c ALL  Gallia,  by  one  Name  called  Comata,  is  divided  into %0a%3c three  Kinds  of  People,  and  those  for  the  most  part  divided %0a%3c one  from  the  other  by  Rivers :  Belgica,  from  Scaldis  to %0a%3c Sequana  :  Celtica,  from  it  to  Garumna ;  and  this  Part  of %0a%3c Gallia  is  also  named  Lugdunensis.  From  thence  to  the  lying %0a%3c out  of  the  Mountain  Pyrenseus,  Aquitania,  formerly  called %0a%3c Aremorica.  Agrippa  hath  made  this  Computation  of  all %0a%3c the  Gallise  lying  between  Rhenus,  Pyrenaeus,  the  Ocean, %0a%3c and  the  Mountains  Gehenna  and  Jura ;  whereby  he  ex- %0a%3c cludeth  Narbonensis  Gallia;  in  Length  420  Miles,  and  in %0a%3c Breadth  313.  Next  to  Scaldis,  the  Toxandri  inhabit  the %0a%3c utmost  Borders,  under  many  Names.  Then  the  Menapii, %0a%3c Morini,  and  Oromansaci ;  joining  upon  that  District  which  is %0a%3c called  Gessoriacus,  the  Brinanni,  Ambiani,  Bellonici,  and %0a%3c Hassi.

The  Mountains  of  Pyrenseus,  which  from  the %0a%3c East  spread  all  the  way  to  the  Southwest,  make  Hispania %0a%3c shorter  on  the  North  Side  than  the  South.  The  nearest %0a%3c Border  of  this  hither  Province  is  the  same  as  the  Tract %0a%3c of  Tarracon,  from  Pyrenseus  along  the  Ocean,  to  the %0a%3c Forest  of  the  Vascones.

The  River  Durius,  one  of  the  greatest  in %0a%3c Hispania,  springing  in  the  Pelendones' Country,  and  running %0a%3c by  Numantia :  and  so  on,  through  the  Arevaci  and  Vaccsei, %0a%3c dividing  the  Vettones  from  Asturia,  and  the  Gallseci  from %0a%3c Lusitania  :  and  there  also  it  keepeth  off  the  Turduli  from  the %0a%3c Bracari.  All  this  Region  abovesaid  from  Pyrenaeus  is  full %0a%3c of  Mines,  of  Gold,  Silver,  Iron,  Lead,  both  black  and  white %0a%3c (Tin). %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  XXI. %0a%3c %0a%3c Lusitania. %0a%3c %0a%3c FROM  the  (River)  Durius  beginneth  Lusitania,  wherein %0a%3c are  Turduli  the  old,  Pesuri,  the  River  Vacca.

The %0a%3c shooting  forth  of  the  Promontory  some  have  reported  to %0a%3c be  60  Miles,  others  90.  From  thence  to  Pyrenaeus  not  a %0a%3c few  say  it  is  1250  Miles  ;  and  that  there  is  a  Nation  of  the %0a%3c Atabri,  which  never  was,  with  a  manifest  Error.  For  they %0a%3c have  set  the  Arrotrebae,  whom  we  have  placed  before  the %0a%3c Celtic  Promontory,  in  this  place,  by  exchanging  some  Let- %0a%3c ters.

From  Durius  to  Tagus  is  200  Miles,  and  Munda %0a%3c cometh  between.  Tagus  is  much  renowned  for  Sand  that %0a%3c yieldeth  Gold  :  160  Miles  from  it  the  Promontory  Sacrum %0a%3c (Sacred)  runneth  out  from  about  the  middle  Front  of  His- %0a%3c pania :  and  Varro  saith  it  is  14  Miles  from  it  to  the  midst  of %0a%3c Pyrenaeus.

[BooK  IV. %0a%3c %0a%3c hath  written,  that  Lusitania,  with  Asturia  and  Gallsecia,  is  in %0a%3c Length  540  Miles,  and  in  Breadth  526.  But  all  the  His- %0a%3c panise  (Spains),  from  the  two  Promontories  of  Pyrenaeus  along %0a%3c the  Seas,  are  supposed  to  take  up  in  Circuit  of  the  whole %0a%3c Coast  2900  Miles,  and  by  others,  2700.  Over  against  Celti- %0a%3c beria  are  very  many  Islands,  called  by  the  Greeks  Cassiterides, %0a%3c from  the  plenty  of  Lead  -,1  and  from  the  region  of  the  Pro- %0a%3c montory of  the  Arrotrebae,  six  named  Deorum  (i.  e.  of  the %0a%3c Gods)  which  some  have  called  Fortunatae.  But  in  the  very %0a%3c Cape  of  Bsetica,  from  the  Mouth  of  the  Strait  75  Miles, %0a%3c lieth  the  Island  Gades,  12  Miles  long,  as  Polybim  writeth, %0a%3c and  3  Miles  broad.  It  is  distant  from  the  Continent,  where %0a%3c it  is  nearest,  less  than  700  Paces,2  in  other  Parts  above  7 %0a%3c Miles.  Its  space  containeth  15  Miles.  It  hath  a  Town  of %0a%3c Roman  Citizens,  which  is  named  Augusta,  Urbs  Julia %0a%3c Gaditana.  On  that  side  that  looks  toward  Spain,  within %0a%3c about  100  Paces,  is  another  Island,  3  Miles  long,  and  a %0a%3c Mile  broad,  wherein  formerly  was  the  Town  of  Gades.  The %0a%3c Name  of  this  Island,  according  to  Ephorus  and  Philistides,  is %0a%3c Erythia :  but  according  to  Timceus  and  Silenus,  Aphrodisias  : %0a%3c by  the  Native  Inhabitants,  of  Juno.  The  bigger,  'Timaus %0a%3c saith,  was  by  them  called  Cotinusa ;  our  Countrymen  name %0a%3c it  Tartessos,  the  Pceni  Gadir,3  which  in  the  Punic  Lan- %0a%3c guage signifieth4  the  number  of  seven.5  Erythia  was %0a%3c called,  because  the  Tyri  were  reported  to  have  had  their %0a%3c first  beginning  out  of  the  (Red)  Sea,  Erythraeum.  Some  think %0a%3c that  Geryon  here  dwelt,  whose  Herds  Hercules  took  away. %0a%3c There  are  again  some  who  think  that  it  is  another,  over %0a%3c %0a%3c See  p.  36,  c.  xvi. %0a%3c %0a%3c Less  than  three-quarters  of  a  mile. %0a%3c %0a%3c Or  Gadiz. %0a%3c %0a%3c Septem,  or,  as  some  read,  Septum  (i.  e.  a  park  or  enclosure). %0a%3c %0a%3c From  the  Hebrew  root  signifying  to  make  a  fence,  the  Phoenicians %0a%3c called  any  enclosed  space  Gaddir,  and  particularly  gave  this  name  to  their %0a%3c settlement  on  the  south-western  coast  of  Spain,  which  the  Greeks  from %0a%3c them  called  Gaderia,  the  Romans  Gades,  and  we  Cadiz.  See  Bochart, %0a%3c vol.  i.  628-734.  This  name  is  very  appropriately  given  to  the  island %0a%3c mentioned  by  Pliny ;  but  why  it  should  be  derived  from  a  Punic  word %0a%3c signifying  seven  is  not  so  apparent. â€”  Wern.

Artemidorus  and  Isldorus  have %0a%3c set  down  the  Length  of  it  from  Tanais  to  Gades  84,014 %0a%3c Miles.  Polybius  hath  put  down  the  Breadth  of  Europe, from %0a%3c Italy  to  the  Ocean  1150  Miles,  for  then  the  largeness  of  it %0a%3c was  not  known.  But  the  Breadth  of  Italy  itself  (as  we  have %0a%3c shewn)  is  1220  Miles  to  the  Alps :  from  whence  by  Lug- %0a%3c dunum  to  the  Port  of  the  Morini  in  Britain,  from  which %0a%3c Polybius  seemeth  to  take  his  Measure,  is  1168  Miles.  But %0a%3c the  more  certain  Measure,  and  the  longer,  is  directed  from %0a%3c the  said  Alps  to  the  extreme  West  and  the  Mouth  of  the %0a%3c Rhenus,  through  the  Camps  of  the  Legions  of  Germania, %0a%3c 1243  Miles.
