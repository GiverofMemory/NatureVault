text=AVRAHAM %0a%0a%0a%0a45. Rabbi Yosi said, "I heard from the great source of Light, i.e., from Rabbi %0aShimon Bar-Yochai, that BARAH is a concealed word, the key to which locked %0ait up and did not unlock it. And since the key locked up the word BARAH, %0athere was no world and no possibility of its existence, and nothingness enveloped %0aall. And when nothingness rules, there is no world, nor its existence." %0a%0a46. So when did this key unlock those gates, and everything became ready for %0athe existence and evolution of the generations? When Avraham appeared, %0aas he is the property of Hesed (mercy), of which it is written, "These are %0athe generations of Heaven and earth Be-Hibar'am (with which He built)." %0aHowever, one should pronounce the word not as Be-Hibar'am, but as %0aBe-AvraHom (in Hebrew, these two words consist of the same letters, but in %0aa slightly different order). Then, all that was concealed in the word BARAH %0awas revealed as letters, meaning that the Kelim opened up to listen. And there %0aappears the Pillar of Procreation, the sacred Yesod, upon which the world's %0aexistence is based, for the word BARAH consists of the same letters as the %0aword AVAR (passed). %0a%0aHe asks: "When it is revealed, can one act and produce generations?" This %0aquestion includes three questions: %0a%0a1. When will it be revealed? When Malchut descends from the Eynaim %0a(where she ascended as a result of Tzimtzum Bet) to her previous %0aplace in the Peh, which leads to the revelation of the forty-nine gates %0aof Hochma; %0a%0a2. When can it be used? When Ohr Hochma clothes in Ohr Hassadim, as %0aa result of which AHP can receive Ohr Hochma, for unless it is clothed %0ain Ohr Hassadim, Ml = GE cannot shine within ELEH = AHP, as the %0aLight is not yet suitable for reception and use by the lower ones; %0a%0a189 %0a%0a%0a%0a190 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0a3. What does it mean to produce, multiply generations? Generations %0aare the souls that exist in the worlds BYA, begotten by ZA de Atzilut. %0aAfter ZA receives the Lights of Hochma and Hassadim (the Light of %0aperfection), this Light enables him to make a Zivug with Nukva and %0abeget the souls of the righteous. %0a%0aWORLD OF AK %0a%0aWORLD OF ATZILUT: AA of the world of Atzilut %0aAVI of the world of Atzilut %0a%0aZON of the world of Atzilut produce and feed the souls of the righteous %0a%0a— Parsa %0a%0aWORLD OF BERIA %0a%0aWORLD OF YETZIRA the souls of the righteous in the worlds BYA %0aWORLD ORASSIYA %0a%0aMachsom, the transition from egoism to altruism %0a%0aOUR EGOISTIC WORLD %0a%0a%0a%0aAvraham is the property of the Sefira Hesed in Partzuf ZA during its Gadlut (bi£ %0astate), when Hesed ascends and becomes Hochma: Sefirot HGT become HBD: %0a%0aPARTZUF ZA %0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0aHochma) %0a%0a%0a%0a%0a(Gevura %0a%0a%0a%0a%0aHesed ) %0a%0a%0aTifferet %0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0aNetzah J %0a%0aP %0a%0a%0aYesod %0a%0a%0a%0aHBD {HaBaD) %0a%0a%0a%0aHGT (HaGaT) %0a%0a%0a%0aNHY(AfeffY) %0a%0a%0a%0aAVRAHAM %0a%0a%0a%0a191 %0a%0a%0a%0aBefore Avraham appeared, everything was concealed in the word BARAH %0aand nothingness ruled over the world— there was neither Ohr Hochma nor Ohr %0aHassadim in ZON. However, when Avraham (the Light of Hesed that descends %0ato ZA) appeared, the gates were opened for Ohr Hochma, for Malchut descended %0afrom Eynaim to Peh, and YESHSUT merged with AVI into one degree, which %0aled to the descent of Ohr Hochma to YESHSUT, for Ohr Hassadim of Avraham's %0aproperties was already present in ZA. %0a%0aOhr Hochma then clothed in Ohr Hassadim, Ml (GE) joined ELEH (AHP), %0athe Creator's name ELO-IM was completed, and Hochma filled ZA. Then Malchut %0adescended from Eynaim to Peh in ZA, and ZA received new AHP from Bina, %0athereby entering Gadlut and passing the Light through his Yesod into Malchut, %0acalled the "lower world." As a result, Malchut begets the souls of the righteous. %0a%0a47. When Yesod of ZA joins the word BARAH (Malchut), there occurs a %0aconcealed and supernal division of the Creator's name and greatness, called %0aMI, and ELEH comes into being. Also, the sacred name MA comes from %0aBARAH. The sacred concealed ELEH exists just like Yesod. Yet, when Yesod %0aattains its complete state, the Partzuf attains its complete state, the letter Hey %0acorresponds to Yesod and the letter Yod— to ELEH. %0a%0aHere, The Zohar clarifies which Light is present in ZA, depending on his %0astates. In the Sefira Yesod of Partzuf ZA there is an end, meaning a place of %0acontact with Malchut, the place of the covenant between the Creator (ZA) and %0athe Shechina (the souls of the righteous), also called "Israel" or Malchut. This %0aplace of contact is called Ateret Yesod (encirclement of Yesod) or Keter de ZA (the %0acrown of ZA). %0a%0aThe word BARAH signifies Katnut (small state), which comes as a result %0aof Malchut's ascent to NE. AVI never abandon the properties of GAR de Bina %0a(properties of mercy); they do not desire to receive. Having ascended and %0astanding in them, Malchut is called Man'ula (lock), which prevents the Light from %0aspreading below her. Ateret Yesod de ZA is called Miftacha (key), for it is through %0aits property that the Light can be received in the Partzufim located below AVI. %0a%0aThis is possible on condition that ELEH = AHP ascend to MI = GE. Ohr %0aHochma can be received in the Kelim ELEH that wish to receive it, but only upon %0atheir ascension above Parsa. However, until the properties of Malchut acquire %0athe property of Bina, until they are "softened" by this property, there is no way %0ato receive the Light, and Malchut is called "the 50 th gate." %0a%0aHence, we see that the words MI BARAH ELEH signify not the question, %0a"Who created these?" but the action: MI = GE BARAH (created) ELEH = AHP by %0a%0a%0a%0a192 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0athe descent of Malchut from NE back to Peh. As a result, ELEH = AHP ascended %0ato the Rosh and there received the Light of GAR (Hochma). %0a%0aUpon descending to Peh, Malchut is called MA, as that is the name of the %0alower world. Her screen in the Peh makes a Zivug, onto which descends Ohr %0aHassadim, called "Light of blessing," for it abolishes the prohibition and the lock %0aimposed on the diffusion of Light. %0a%0a48. When the letters Hey and Yod wished to complement one another, the %0aletter Mem emerged from them, and the word ELO-HIM = ELE + Hey + %0aYod + Mem was formed by the union of both sides. The word AVAR + Hey %0a+ Mem = Avraham originated from ELEH. However, one might say that the %0aCreator took the words ELEH and MI, joined them and formed the word %0aELOKIM, whereas the words MA and AVAR formed the word Avraham, %0awhere the word MI designates the fifty gates of Bina, and the word MA refers %0ato the numerical value of the holy name, for HaVaYaH with the filling of the %0aletter Aleph forms the Qematria of MA— 45. %0a%0aBoth this world and the world to come exist in these two letters, Yod and %0aHey. This world is in Yod, and the world to come is in Hey. Hence, the world to %0acome was created with MI, and this world with MA. %0a%0aIt is therefore written: "These are the created (Be-Hibar'am) generations %0aof Heaven and earth," where the letters Be-Hibar'am make up the word %0a"Avraham," for there was no perfection until the letters formed this word. %0aTherefore, the Creator's name HaVaYaH is first mentioned in the Torah only %0aafter the name Avraham. %0a%0aOhr Hassadim in MA and Ohr Hochma in ELEH wished to complement one %0aanother and be complemented within one another. As a result, Ohr Hochma %0aclothed in Ohr Hassadim, and Malchut receives from both Hassadim and Hochma. %0aIn so doing, MA and MI join and create MM, i.e., Malchut that receives Ohr %0aHochma clothed in Ohr Hassadim from Above.
