text=The Sixth Commandment %0a%0a%0a%0a219. The sixth Mitzva is to procreate and multiply, for he who does so turns %0athe stream, called Yesod de ZA, into an inexhaustible fountain. And the sea, %0aMalchut, shall be filled from all directions, and new souls shall come forth %0afrom that tree, and a multitude of forces shall appear together with those %0asouls, to guard them. Hence, it is written: LET THE WATERS SWARM %0aWITH SWARMS OF LIVING CREATURES. This is the mark of the holy %0aCovenant. The stream grows stronger, turns into a river, and thus brings more %0aand more new souls to life. %0a%0aAn awakening from below causes an awakening from Above: raising MAN, %0athe prayers and requests of the lower ones to receive strength so they can perform %0aspiritual, altruistic actions, stimulate a Zivug Above between the Creator and the %0aShechina. As a result, the stream, Yesod de ZA, fills with water and descends to %0aNukva de ZA, filling her on all sides, wishing to both revive all the worlds (to %0abestow Ohr Hassadim) and bear new souls (pass Ohr Hochma downward, for birth %0ais possible only in Ohr Hochma). %0a%0aThere are two kinds of Zivugim de ZON: (i) a "Zivug of existence" on Ohr %0aHassadim, from which Ohr Hassadim descends to provide the lower souls with %0awhat they need for their existence. This Zivug on Ohr Hassadim also gives birth %0ato angels, (ii) A "Zivug of birth" on Ohr Hochma, which leads to the creation of %0anew Partzufim, new human souls. %0a%0aThese new souls emerge from the Tree (ZA). However, although they are %0acalled new, the genuinely new souls originate in the world of Ein Sof (Infinity), %0awhereas these souls were already within Adam, and fell into the impure forces %0aas a result of his sin. Now they are revived with the help of the Tree of Life (ZA); %0ahence, they are called "new souls." A multitude of other forces, called Heavenly %0a%0a411 %0a%0a%0a%0a412 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0ahosts or armies, descends along with them. But completely new souls descend to %0athe world only after the correction of Adam's sin has been completed. %0a%0aYesod de ZA is called a "covenant," because we (Malchut, souls) feel and %0areceive from it all the Light of our life. It constitutes the source of our life, %0adescending to us from the Tree of Life (ZA). ZA ascends to AVI (called "garden") %0ain order to take the waters from them and fill Malchut, his Nukva. A Zivug on %0aVAK {Hassadim) is called WATERS SWARM, and a Zivug on GAR {Hochma) is %0acalled LIVING CREATURES. %0a%0a220. A number of birds (angels) that soar above the whole world enter %0aMalchut along with those souls. When a soul comes into this world, the bird %0athat came from that tree along with that soul accompanies it. How many %0aangels leave with each soul? Two: one on the right, and one on the left. If %0aone so merits, they guard him, as it is written: FOR HE WILL GIVE HIS %0aANGELS CHARGE OVER YOU. Yet, if he does not merit, they report and %0aaccuse him. Rabbi Pinchas said: "There are three angels that guard man, %0aif he so merits, as it is written, IF THERE BE AN ANGEL OVER HIM, %0aA DEFENDER, ONE AMONG A THOUSAND THAT WARNS MAN. If %0athere be an ANGEL— is the first; A DEFENDER— is the second; one among a %0athousand THAT WARNS man-is the third." %0a%0a221. Rabbi Shimon said: "In all, there are five angels, for the verse continues: %0a'there is one after the giver and two more, so in all there are five.'" He replied: %0a"This is not so. 'The giver' refers solely to the Creator Himself, and not to an %0aangel, for only the Creator is permitted to give, but no one else." %0a%0aA number of angels come forth together with the begotten souls. These %0aangels are called "soaring" or "flying." They help the souls to sentence to the %0ascale of merit, or, conversely, complain to the Creator about these souls, and %0apush them toward the scale of sin, which entails punishments. These angels soar %0aabove the world, see how the Creator rules over all, and report all this to the %0asoul. If the soul so merits, it sentences itself and the entire world to the scale of %0amerit; if not, it sentences itself and the entire world to the scale of sin. %0a%0aTherefore, Rabbi Pinchas does not dispute Rabbi Shimon when he says %0athat only two angels are born with a soul. Rather, he says that as long as there %0aare only two angels in man, he cannot sentence to the scale of merit completely, %0aand keeps moving between the scales of sin (punishment) and merit (reward). %0aHowever, through one's good deeds, the third angel is born within him, which %0aenables man to sentence everything to the scale of merit. Hence, only with the %0ahelp of the three angels can he achieve his correction. %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Sixth Commandment %0a%0a%0a%0a413 %0a%0a%0a%0a222. And he who abstains from procreating and multiplying belittles (so to %0aspeak) the form that includes all other forms, the form of man, causes that %0astream, Yesod of ZA, to dry out, and harms the holy Covenant (Yesod of %0aZA) from all sides. It is written of such a man, "Go forth and look upon %0athe corpses of those that have transgressed against the Creator." Of course, %0athose who transgress against Me. This is said about the body, as the soul never %0aeven enters the screen, i.e., the Creator's domain. And such a man shall be %0abanished from the world. %0a%0aMalchut is called a "form," a "property" that contains all of the other %0aproperties, for all the forms of NRN of the righteous and of the angels in the %0athree worlds of BYA originate from her. They constitute all the hosts and armies. %0aAnd those that do not procreate and multiply thereby diminish the form of %0aMalchut and prevent her from using all of her hosts and armies. For with the %0ahelp of MAN that the lower ones raise, the Light descends from Above and %0astimulates a Zivug between the Creator and the Shechina. This Zivug creates %0aNRN— the souls of the righteous and the angels in the worlds of BYA. %0a%0aAnd those that impede this Zivug cause the stream (Yesod of ZA) to dry out %0aand stop the flow of its male waters into the holy Shechina, Malchut. In doing so, %0athey harm the holy covenant in all of its properties, for they delay the two parts %0aof the Zivug: VAK (on Ohr Hassadim) and GAR (on Ohr Hochma). %0a%0aThis is because the Mitzva of procreation and multiplication constantly %0adevelops the soul. As a result, man defeats his body forever, so it can rise again %0aduring the resurrection from the dead. And he who abstains from procreating %0aand multiplying turns his body into a corpse, of which it is written: GO FORTH %0aAND LOOK UPON THE CORPSES OF THE PEOPLE, for his soul will not %0abe able to enter the Creator's domain and merge with Him. Thus, he is rejected %0afrom the world to come.
