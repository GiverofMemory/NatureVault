Gerbert,  afterwards %0a> Pope  Silvester  II.,  was  educated  in  the  schools  of  the %0a> Arabs,  in  Spain,  in  the  tenth  century,  and  acquired %0a> their  language.  Less  inventive  than  practical  in  science, %0a> the  Arab  writers  appear  to  have  accumulated  the  ex- %0a> perience of  preceding  authors  rather  than  made  new %0a> discoveries,  to  have  instructed  rather  than  progressed. %0a> The  simple  character  of  the  early  sciences  of  the  far %0a> east,  with  the  speculative  philosophy  of  the  west, %0a> appear  to  have  been  united  to  afford  them  their  know- %0a> ledge. The  Caliphs  Harun-al-Rashid  and  Al-Mamun %0a> were  philosophers  and  scientific  men ;  they  caused  the %0a> Greek  classics  to  be  translated  into  Arabic  ;  from  them %0a> the  writings  of  the  Arab  physicians  are  principally %0a> drawn.  The  mystic  doctrine  of  the  neo-Platonic  school %0a> of  Alexandria,  eminently  qualified  to  captivate  the %0a> ardent  imagination  of  the  Arabs,  was  adopted  by  them  ; %0a> they  attributed  to  the  science  of  alchemy  the  art %0a> of  transmuting  the  metals  into  gold  and  the  universal %0a> panacea  \  Geber,  their  most  famous  chemist,  who %0a> appears  to  have  lived  in  the  eighth  century,  as  he  is %0a> quoted  by  the  Arab  writers  of  the  ninth,  restored %0a> alchemical  science  to  its  true  nature,  and  thereby %0a> earned  the  title  of  the  father  of  chemistry.

The  Benedictines  have  remarked %0a> upon  this  fact,  and  attribute  the  period,  with  every  proba- %0a> bility, to  the  reign  of  Charlemagne,  who  died  in  814  ^  The %0a> art  itself  is  probably  of  Byzantine  origin,  as  the  flux  for %0a> colouring  a  plate  or  vessel  of  glass  was  known  to  the %0a> Greeks,  who  were  much  employed  in  the  manufacture  of %0a> the  coloured  and  gilt  glass  mosaic  work,  as  we  shall  pre- %0a> sently see.  A  fact  is  mentioned  in  the  chronicles  of %0a> the  historian  of  the  monastery  of  St.  Benignus,  at  Dijon, %0a> who  wrote  about  the  year  1052*.

The  clink  of  the  mail,  introduced  by %0a> .  Charles,  drowned  the  voice  of  science,  and  was  only, %0a> but  with  difficulty,  silenced,  when  opposed  to  its %0a> dogmas,  by  the  jealousy  of  the  Roman  Church,  now %0a> become  a  formidable  power.  Another  cause  of  the %0a> general  prostration  of  knowledge,  during  the  tenth %0a> century,  originated  in  the  prevailing  superstition  that, %0a> at  the  end  of  a  thousand  years  from  the  birth  of  Christ, %0a> the  Antichrist  would  appear  and  the  last  days  arrive'. %0a> %0a> When  the  opening  of  the  new  century  had,  however, %0a> somewhat  calmed  this  disorder,  and  as  the  minds  of %0a> men  became  reassured,  the  dark  age  seemed  about  to %0a> pass  away,  and  a  new  zeal  appeared  to  animate  them. %0a> The  ancient  temples  were  everywhere,  even  without %0a> necessity,  demolished ;  and  in  their  places  arose %0a> churches  more  vast  and  rich  than  the  old,  as  if  the %0a> world,  again  grown  young,  were  being  newly  attired*. %0a> %0a> In  the  tenth  century  the  monks  of  Richenaw  orna- %0a> mented many  churches  in  Germany  with  paintings: %0a> Tutilo  and  the  monks  of  St.  Gall  had  erected  and  em- %0a> %0a> %0a> *  Robertson,  Introduction  to  the  Historic  of  Charles  V.,  V.  1, %0a> p.  45. %0a> %0a> ^'  Glabri  Rudolph.

Dunstan,  Aldred  \  and %0a> Lanfranc  in  England,  Robert  in  France,  Hildebrand  at %0a> Rome,  were  encouraging  the  arts,  raising  and  decorat- %0a> ing churches,  which  the  reverence  for  relics  caused  to %0a> be  ornamented  by  sumptuous  shrines  and  costly  gates %0a> of  bronze  or  silver  *.

Lessing,  Leist,  Raspe  and  Emeric  David,  have %0a> placed  Theophilus  in  the  tenth  century,  a  period  too %0a> early,  as  we  may  confidently  infer,  by  remarking  the %0a> occurrence  in  the  work,  not  only  of  Arab  mysticism, %0a> but  of  Arab  nomenclature.  The  chapter  of  Theophilus %0a> on  the  production  of  "  Spanish  Gold,"  L.  III.  p.  267,  is %0a> evidence  of  the  former ;  his  mention  of  Borax,  p.  239, %0a> under  the  confused  name  of  Barabas  or  Parahas,  of  the %0a> latter ;  while  both  instances  shew,  at  the  same  time,  a %0a> %0a> ^  This  was  at  a  period  before  Italy  had  for  a  second  time  become %0a> glorious  by  means  of  art.

This,  coupled %0a> with  the  preceding  facts,  will  place  our  author  in  a  pe- %0a> riod of  transition,  or  among  the  writers  of  the  early  part %0a> of  the  eleventh  century.  The  school  of  medicine  of %0a> Salerno  had  but  commenced  at  that  period  to  inculcate %0a> the  Arab  science,  and  to  disseminate  it  through  Italy. %0a> Had  Theophilus  been  cotemporary  with  Roger  Bacon %0a> or  Raymond  Lully,  as  Mr.  Guichard  supposes,  this  art, %0a> which  would  have  simplified  so  many  of  his  processes  and %0a> which  has  added  so  many  materials  to  art,  would  have %0a> been  noticed.

The  very  few  instances  in  which  Theo- %0a> philus  affords  iconographical  description  are  eminently %0a> of  this  period  of  art.  In  the  delineation  of  the  beaten %0a> censer,  L.  III.  C.  60,  Byzantine  art  is  particularly  ob- %0a> servable ;  the  octangular  towers,  the  long  columns,  the %0a> lengthened  windows,  the  circular  opening  above  the %0a> centre  column  between  them  * ;  the  rivers  of  Paradise %0a> in  human  form,  the  raised  arch  at  the  bottom  of  the %0a> censer,  in  which  are  the  figures  of  the  evangelists, %0a> whether  delineated  in  likeness  of  men  or  symbolically, %0a> are  all  of  Byzantine  art ;  but  in  C.  61,  the  marks  of  the %0a> period  are  yet  stronger.  The  figures  of  the  Jewish %0a> prophets  fraternized  with  those  of  the  apostles,  with %0a> their  names  inscribed  above  the  head,  each  provided %0a> with  their  testimonies  ^^  that  they  may  agree  with  each %0a> other ;"'  the  personification  of  the  virtues,  also  with %0a> the  name  inscribed ;  the  Arabesques ;  are  not  only  By- %0a> zantine, but,  if  introduced  into  the  West,  indicate,  ac- %0a> cording to  M.

Horace %0a> Walpole,  the  Rev.  Mr.  Bentham,  and  Mr.  Smith,  have %0a> shown  that  the  art  of  painting  in  oil  was  practised  in %0a> our  own  country  from  an  early  period  up  to  the  fifteenth %0a> %0a> indiscriminately;  the  side  colonnades  and  porticus  afforded  shelter %0a> to  the  catechumens  and  penitents,  aud  such  others  as  were  not %0a> allowed  to  advance  beyond  the  threshold  of  the  church  itself.

The  passages  from  Eraclius  and  Cennino, %0a> which  I  have  given  in  the  above-named  notes,  are  suflS- %0a> cient  to  prove  that  the  art  of  using  driers  with  oil  in %0a> the  process  of  painting,  so  as  to  render  the  work  less %0a> tedious,  was  likewise  known  previously  to  the  time  of %0a> Van  Eyck ;  the  opinion  of  Raspe  \  in  which  M.  Guichard %0a> coincides,  is  not  therefore  tenable. %0a> %0a> A  third  supposition  was  started  by  Emeric  David  *, %0a> that  painting  in  oil,  having  been  abandoned  in  the %0a> tenth  or  eleventh  century,  had  been  invented  anew  in %0a> the  fifteenth  by  John  Van  Eyck.  This  is  open  to  equal %0a> objection,  as  the  English  authors  referred  to  above  have %0a> shown ;  and  it  is  singular  that  some  of  the  materials %0a> used  for  the  purpose  of  painting  the  chapel  of  St. %0a> Stephen,  in  1350,  were  procured  from  Bruges:  "the %0a> sum  of  four  shillings  and  ten  pence  was  paid  to  '  Lomyn %0a> de  Bruges '  for  six  pounds  and  a  half  of  white  varnish, %0a> at  nine  pence  per  pound." %0a> %0a> Yet  that  Van  Eyck  merely  pursued  the  path  which %0a> had  been  previously  trodden,  no  one  can  admit  who %0a> has  compared  his  works  even  with  those  of  modern %0a> times,  which  we  know  to  have  been  painted  with  oil %0a> simply,  (the  more  ancient  works  having  disappeared %0a> partly  on  that  account,  and  partly  from  the  class  of %0a> colours  in  use,  as  will  be  seen  by  a  reference  to  notes %0a> %0a> ^  See  note -on  "Gummi  Fornis,"  p.  71  of  this  work.

The  works  of  the  Arab  chemists  had  be- %0a> come known;  Albertus  Magnus,  Roger  Bacon,  Arnold %0a> of  Villa  Nova,  Raymond  LuJly,  had  all  lived  and  written %0a> upon  the  "  Magnum  Opus,"  the  basis  of  which  rested %0a> upon  sublimation  and  distillation,  by  means  of  which %0a> the  elixir,  spirit,  or  excellence  of  all  things  were  to  be %0a> extracted.  The  words  of  Lomazzo,  which  we  have %0a> quoted  above,  would  therefore  probably  bear  a  literal %0a> meaning. %0a> %0a> Leonardo  da  Vinci  is  stated  to  have  followed  the %0a> manner  of  colouring  invented  by  John  of  Bruges,  and %0a> to  have  thinned  his  oil  by  means  of  alembics.  This,  I %0a> was  convinced,  intended,  that  Leonardo  distilled  the  oil %0a> (he  himself  mentions  walnut  oil)  for  the  purpose  of %0a> painting. %0a> %0a> Aware  that  the  older  Italian  writers  used  the  word %0a> **  lamiicco  "  as  representing  any  chemical  apparatus,  yet %0a> %0a> ^  The  materials  employed  are  1  tb  linseed  oil,  fyn  olys ;  4  ounces %0a> of  amber  in  powder,  bernsteen  ghepulviri  ;  (a  loet  is  half  an  ounce,) %0a> and  1  pound  litharge,  spigelhars.  The  amber  is  dissolved  with  a  ^^^^  ytxy^ %0a> little  oil  over  the  fire ;  when  dissolved,  the  oil  is  added  hot  by %0a> degrees  ;  the  litharge,  of  which  an  enormous  quantity  is  added,  is  >t.jC^^%3c^ %0a> then  put  in;  it  is  cooked  a  little,  and  is  finished.  There  were %0a> various  modes  of  making  this  varnish  practised  in  Italy  at  a  later %0a> period.  The  process  here  described  would  make  a  very  dark %0a> ▼arnish,  which  would  require  to  be  thinned  with  walnut  or  other %0a> oil  for  use. %0a> %0a> %0a> XZXIV  PREFACE. %0a> %0a> baving  always  found  that  by  stiUare  or  assotiglmre  per %0a> lambicco  distillation  was  intended,  while  filtration  was  de- %0a> scribed as  distiUare  perfeltrOy  it  became  necessary  to  seek %0a> for  any  precedent  that  distilled  linseed,  or  walnut  oil, %0a> was  used  in  the  art  of  painting,  experimenting,  at  the %0a> same  time,  at  home.  I  was  fortunate  enough  to  suc- %0a> ceed in  both  instances  \ %0a> %0a> ^  I  think  it  better  to  give  the  result  of  the  experiment  as  I  noted %0a> it  down  at  the  time  it  was  tried,  without  further  comment  than  that %0a> it  is  one  which  should  be  attempted  by  no  inexperienced  hands ; %0a> the  explosive  nature  of  the  gas  produced  rendering  the  process %0a> highly  dangerous  to  an  unskilful  person,  although  a  very  simple %0a> and  easy  one  to  the  chemist,  or  other  operator. %0a> %0a> Walnut  Oil  :  its  Distllation. — March,  184-5,  and  July  25, 1845. %0a> %0a> .  4  oz.  distilled  in  a  glass  retort  and  receiver,  over  a  small  char- %0a> coal (ire  without  flame. %0a> %0a> Water  was  the  first  product ;  then  came  over  a  light-coloured %0a> empyreumatic  oil,  which  gradually  became  of  a  darker  colour, %0a> mixed  with  water  during  the  whole  process  of  distillation. %0a> %0a> The  ebullition  in  tlie  retort  was  at  first  great,  but  it  gradually %0a> lessened  as  the  oil  became  of  greater  substance.  The  heat  is  required %0a> to  be  increased  to  keep  up  the  vapour  producing  the  distilled  oil. %0a> As  the  process  continued,  this  vapour  became  more  abundant,  and %0a> a  quantity  of  gas  was  liberated,  to  allow  of  the  escape  of  which  the %0a> stopper  in  the  receiver  must  be  greased  and  loosely  dropped  into %0a> its  place;  care  should  be  taken  to  visit  this  often,  in  order  to  guard %0a> against  explosion.  It  appears  to  me  during  this  process  that  oil %0a> will  not  spontaneously  take  fire  at  a  great  heat;  it  requires  contact %0a> with  flame  or  a  red  heat  in  order  to  do  so. %0a> %0a> Carbonic  acid  and  carhureiied  hydrogen  gas  are  the  principal %0a> gases  produced.  This  mixture  of  gases,  probably  owing  to  the %0a> great  excess  of  carburetted  hydrogen,  is  highly  inflammable :  it  is %0a> the  production  of  this,  not  of  a  highly  inflammable  volatile  oil, %0a> which  causes  oil,  raised  to  a  very  high  temperature,  to  take  fire %0a> when  in  contact  with  flame,  or  highly  heated  bodies,  such  as  red- %0a> hot  iron,  &c. %0a> %0a> Volatile  oils  of  two  specific  gravities  were  produced ;  the  first %0a> (before  an  increased  temperature  was  given  to  the  retort)  was  of  a %0a> %0a> %0a> PREKA.CB.  XXZT %0a> %0a> The  earliest  mention  I  find  of  distilled  linseed  oil  is %0a> in  conjunction  with  amber  varnish;  it  is  to  be  used  as %0a> a  varnish,  or  glaze,  upon  painted  subjects,  and  it  is  con- %0a> tained in  a  collection  of  recipes  relative  to  the  Arts, %0a> %0a> less  specific  gravity,  and  also  of  a  lighter  colour  than  that  which %0a> follows,  and  it  forms  a  stratum  upon  the  darker  and  denser  vola- %0a> tile oil.  The  darker  volatile  oil  is  of  the  colour  of  pale  amber, %0a> the  lighter  a  very  pale  straw  colour,  almost  colourless.  They %0a> unite  by  agitation,  as  also  will  the  small  quantity  of  water,  if  the  oil %0a> is  not  carefully  decanted  from  it. %0a> %0a> Memorandum,  October  £8,  1845. %0a> %0a> This  distilled  or  empyreumatic  oil  should  be  kept  in  a  jar  covered %0a> with  muslin  so  as  merely  to  keep  out  dust  and  dirt,  but  to  allow  the %0a> entrance  of  air  and  the  escape  of  the  empyreuma.  In  a  short  time %0a> this  oil,  which  is  at  first  so  pungent  and  offensive,  becomes  gradu- %0a> ally of  less  powerful  odour,  and  in  a  few  weeks  is  not  of  more  un- %0a> pleasant smell  than  boiled  linseed  oil.

"  Even  the  Anglo-Saxons,"  writes  Henry*, %0a%3c **  who  were  among  the  most  destructive  of  the  northern %0a%3c conquerors  who  overturned  the  Roman  empire,  did  not %0a%3c long  continue  to  despise  the  pleasing  arts,  particularly %0a%3c that  of  painting,  which  was  practised  by  them  with  con- %0a%3c siderable success."  We  find  that,  previously  to  the %0a%3c edict  by  which  Charlemagne  resolved  to  encourage  the %0a%3c various  arts  to  the  utmost  of  his  power,  Wilfred, %0a%3c Bishop  of  York,  and  Biscops,  his  friend,  had  already %0a%3c extensively  availed  themselves  of  the  assistance  of  the %0a%3c artists,  in  order  to  decorate  the  cathedral  of  St.  Peter, %0a%3c before  the  year  675.

Gerbert,  afterwards %0a%3c Pope  Silvester  II.,  was  educated  in  the  schools  of  the %0a%3c Arabs,  in  Spain,  in  the  tenth  century,  and  acquired %0a%3c their  language.  Less  inventive  than  practical  in  science, %0a%3c the  Arab  writers  appear  to  have  accumulated  the  ex- %0a%3c perience of  preceding  authors  rather  than  made  new %0a%3c discoveries,  to  have  instructed  rather  than  progressed. %0a%3c The  simple  character  of  the  early  sciences  of  the  far %0a%3c east,  with  the  speculative  philosophy  of  the  west, %0a%3c appear  to  have  been  united  to  afford  them  their  know- %0a%3c ledge. The  Caliphs  Harun-al-Rashid  and  Al-Mamun %0a%3c were  philosophers  and  scientific  men ;  they  caused  the %0a%3c Greek  classics  to  be  translated  into  Arabic  ;  from  them %0a%3c the  writings  of  the  Arab  physicians  are  principally %0a%3c drawn.  The  mystic  doctrine  of  the  neo-Platonic  school %0a%3c of  Alexandria,  eminently  qualified  to  captivate  the %0a%3c ardent  imagination  of  the  Arabs,  was  adopted  by  them  ; %0a%3c they  attributed  to  the  science  of  alchemy  the  art %0a%3c of  transmuting  the  metals  into  gold  and  the  universal %0a%3c panacea  \  Geber,  their  most  famous  chemist,  who %0a%3c appears  to  have  lived  in  the  eighth  century,  as  he  is %0a%3c quoted  by  the  Arab  writers  of  the  ninth,  restored %0a%3c alchemical  science  to  its  true  nature,  and  thereby %0a%3c earned  the  title  of  the  father  of  chemistry.  Geber  has %0a%3c the  credit  of  making  known  the  process  of  distillation %0a%3c by  a  simple  description,  although  this  art  had  been  for %0a%3c centuries  described  in  the  books  of  the  initiated  '• %0a%3c %0a%3c ^  Pocock.

XI %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The  ninth  century,  however,  offers  the  important  fistct, %0a%3c in  the  history  of  the  arts,  of  the  invention  or  introduction %0a%3c of  Painting  upon  Glass.  The  Benedictines  have  remarked %0a%3c upon  this  fact,  and  attribute  the  period,  with  every  proba- %0a%3c bility, to  the  reign  of  Charlemagne,  who  died  in  814  ^  The %0a%3c art  itself  is  probably  of  Byzantine  origin,  as  the  flux  for %0a%3c colouring  a  plate  or  vessel  of  glass  was  known  to  the %0a%3c Greeks,  who  were  much  employed  in  the  manufacture  of %0a%3c the  coloured  and  gilt  glass  mosaic  work,  as  we  shall  pre- %0a%3c sently see.  A  fact  is  mentioned  in  the  chronicles  of %0a%3c the  historian  of  the  monastery  of  St.  Benignus,  at  Dijon, %0a%3c who  wrote  about  the  year  1052*.  He  states  "that %0a%3c there  existed  yet  in  his  time  a  very  ancient  glass  window, %0a%3c in  the  church  of  the  monastery,  representing  the  mar- %0a%3c tyrdom of  St.  Paschasie,  and  that  this  painting  had %0a%3c been  taken  from  the  old  church  restored  by  Charles %0a%3c the  Bald/"  The  reasoning  appears  inconclusive  by %0a%3c which  David  seeks  to  limit  the  invention  to  the  reign %0a%3c of  this  later  monarch,  as  such  poets,  who  have  at  all %0a%3c alluded  to  coloured  glass  as  used  in  windows,  have  so %0a%3c cursorily  noticed  it,  that  it  is  sometimes  even  difficult %0a%3c to  determine  their  meaning ;  the  art  was  neither  neces- %0a%3c sarily, nor  would  it  be  even  probably,  included  in  their %0a%3c descriptions,  which  relate  to  the  effect  produced  by  the %0a%3c light  transmitted  through  the  coloured  medium  ^ %0a%3c %0a%3c ^  Histoire  litteraire  de  la  France,  par  les  Benedictines  de  St. %0a%3c Maur.

The  clink  of  the  mail,  introduced  by %0a%3c .  Charles,  drowned  the  voice  of  science,  and  was  only, %0a%3c but  with  difficulty,  silenced,  when  opposed  to  its %0a%3c dogmas,  by  the  jealousy  of  the  Roman  Church,  now %0a%3c become  a  formidable  power.  Another  cause  of  the %0a%3c general  prostration  of  knowledge,  during  the  tenth %0a%3c century,  originated  in  the  prevailing  superstition  that, %0a%3c at  the  end  of  a  thousand  years  from  the  birth  of  Christ, %0a%3c the  Antichrist  would  appear  and  the  last  days  arrive'. %0a%3c %0a%3c When  the  opening  of  the  new  century  had,  however, %0a%3c somewhat  calmed  this  disorder,  and  as  the  minds  of %0a%3c men  became  reassured,  the  dark  age  seemed  about  to %0a%3c pass  away,  and  a  new  zeal  appeared  to  animate  them. %0a%3c The  ancient  temples  were  everywhere,  even  without %0a%3c necessity,  demolished ;  and  in  their  places  arose %0a%3c churches  more  vast  and  rich  than  the  old,  as  if  the %0a%3c world,  again  grown  young,  were  being  newly  attired*. %0a%3c %0a%3c In  the  tenth  century  the  monks  of  Richenaw  orna- %0a%3c mented many  churches  in  Germany  with  paintings: %0a%3c Tutilo  and  the  monks  of  St.  Gall  had  erected  and  em- %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c *  Robertson,  Introduction  to  the  Historic  of  Charles  V.,  V.  1, %0a%3c p.  45. %0a%3c %0a%3c ^'  Glabri  Rudolph.

The  bad  Latinity  in  which  it  is %0a%3c composed,  the  complaints  made  by  the  author  of  the %0a%3c neglect  into  which  the  arts  had  fallen,  sustain  this  sup- %0a%3c position. %0a%3c %0a%3c ''  Jam  decus  ingenii  quod  plebs  Romana  probatur %0a%3c Decidit,  ut  peril t  sapientium  cara  senatum. %0a%3c Quia  nunc  has  artes  investigare  valebit  ? %0a%3c Quas  isti  artifices  immensa  mente  potentes %0a%3c Invenere  sibi,  potens  est  ostendere  nobis.*' %0a%3c %0a%3c That  Eraclius,  or  Heraclius,  was  posterior  to  the %0a%3c seventh  century,  his  quotation  from  Isidore,  who  died %0a%3c A.D.  636,  attests.  That  he  did  not  write  later  than  the %0a%3c decline  of  the  tenth,  the  absence  of  all  allusion  to  the %0a%3c infusion  of  Arab  science,  which  at  the  close  of  that %0a%3c century  tinctured  the  arts  of  Europe,  would  denote. %0a%3c %0a%3c The  art  of  Eraclius  is  of  the  school  of  Pliny,  in- %0a%3c creased, it  is  true,  by  Byzantine  invention,  but  yet %0a%3c essentially  Roman.  Since  Pliny  had  written,  the  art %0a%3c of  glass  manufacture  and  painting  on  glass  and  porce- %0a%3c lain ha(i  made  great  progress,  and  the  chapters  of %0a%3c Eraclius  upon  this  head  are  interesting ;  a  few  of  these %0a%3c are  quoted  by  Theophilus.  The  treatise  of  Eraclius %0a%3c likewise  proves  the  existence  of  the  art  of  mixing %0a%3c colours  with  oil  and  of  the  preparation  of  canvasses, %0a%3c skins,  or  panels,  with  colours  ground  in  linseed  oil,  for %0a%3c the  purpose  of  the  reception  of  paintings  which  were %0a%3c %0a%3c ^  Eckerhardi  Carniina,  T.  2>  part  3. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c XJV  PREFACE. %0a%3c %0a%3c afterwards  to  be  executed  in  colours  ground  in  the %0a%3c same  oil  \ %0a%3c %0a%3c ^  The  most  voluminous  MS.  of  Eraclius  at  present  known  is %0a%3c contained  in  the  collection  of  writers  upon  ancient  art  made  by %0a%3c '*Magister  Johannes  Le  Begue,  lieentiatus  in  legibns,  greffarius %0a%3c generalinm  magistrorum  monetse  regis.

Emulation %0a%3c was  first  directed  to  the  sciences  and  literature,  which %0a%3c at  that  period  the  services  of  the  church  and  political %0a%3c quarrels  rendered  the  most  necessary,  towards  theology, %0a%3c jurisprudence,  geometry,  logic,  rhetoric,  music  or  psalm- %0a%3c ody, architeeture,  and  painting.  Dunstan,  Aldred  \  and %0a%3c Lanfranc  in  England,  Robert  in  France,  Hildebrand  at %0a%3c Rome,  were  encouraging  the  arts,  raising  and  decorat- %0a%3c ing churches,  which  the  reverence  for  relics  caused  to %0a%3c be  ornamented  by  sumptuous  shrines  and  costly  gates %0a%3c of  bronze  or  silver  *.

The %0a%3c ornaments  for  the  Roman  altars,  desks  of  gilt  bronze, %0a%3c and  objects  which  ornamented  the  choirs  much  favoured %0a%3c the  arts  of  casting  metals,  modelling,  enamelling,  niello, %0a%3c damascene  work,  and  often  produced  works  of  surpass- %0a%3c ing execution\ %0a%3c %0a%3c It  is  to  this  period,  the  early  half  of  the  eleventh %0a%3c century,  that  the  work  of  Theophilus  upon  "The %0a%3c DivEJts  Arts  "  is  to  be  ascribed. %0a%3c %0a%3c While  Greece  was  the  painter  qf  the  continent ; %0a%3c Tuscany,  the  enameller;  Arabia,  the  worker  in  metals; %0a%3c %0a%3c de  L'Escalopier.

Lessing,  Leist,  Raspe  and  Emeric  David,  have %0a%3c placed  Theophilus  in  the  tenth  century,  a  period  too %0a%3c early,  as  we  may  confidently  infer,  by  remarking  the %0a%3c occurrence  in  the  work,  not  only  of  Arab  mysticism, %0a%3c but  of  Arab  nomenclature.  The  chapter  of  Theophilus %0a%3c on  the  production  of  "  Spanish  Gold,"  L.  III.  p.  267,  is %0a%3c evidence  of  the  former ;  his  mention  of  Borax,  p.  239, %0a%3c under  the  confused  name  of  Barabas  or  Parahas,  of  the %0a%3c latter ;  while  both  instances  shew,  at  the  same  time,  a %0a%3c %0a%3c ^  This  was  at  a  period  before  Italy  had  for  a  second  time  become %0a%3c glorious  by  means  of  art.

This,  coupled %0a%3c with  the  preceding  facts,  will  place  our  author  in  a  pe- %0a%3c riod of  transition,  or  among  the  writers  of  the  early  part %0a%3c of  the  eleventh  century.  The  school  of  medicine  of %0a%3c Salerno  had  but  commenced  at  that  period  to  inculcate %0a%3c the  Arab  science,  and  to  disseminate  it  through  Italy. %0a%3c Had  Theophilus  been  cotemporary  with  Roger  Bacon %0a%3c or  Raymond  Lully,  as  Mr.  Guichard  supposes,  this  art, %0a%3c which  would  have  simplified  so  many  of  his  processes  and %0a%3c which  has  added  so  many  materials  to  art,  would  have %0a%3c been  noticed.  The  influence  of  the  crusades,  although %0a%3c doubtless  great  upon  the  taste  of  Western  Europe,  we %0a%3c have  already  seen  could  have  but  little,  if  at  all,  added %0a%3c to  the  sciences.  There  is  no  art  mentioned  by  Theo- %0a%3c philus which  was  unknown  at  the  commencement  of %0a%3c the  eleventh  century ;  yet  distillation,  or  any  of  its  pro- %0a%3c ducts, is  omitted,  although  a  glimmering  of  Arab  science %0a%3c is  observable  in  the  work. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c '  "  The  works  of  the  Arabs  were  known  in  Italy  before  they  were %0a%3c known  in  France  and  the  other  countries  of  £urope/'  Hoefer, %0a%3c Hist,  de  la  Chimie,  p.  346. %0a%3c %0a%3c b %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Xrill  PREFACE. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Another  circumstance  maj  be  adduced  favourable  to %0a%3c this  opinion.  The  very  few  instances  in  which  Theo- %0a%3c philus  affords  iconographical  description  are  eminently %0a%3c of  this  period  of  art.  In  the  delineation  of  the  beaten %0a%3c censer,  L.  III.  C.  60,  Byzantine  art  is  particularly  ob- %0a%3c servable ;  the  octangular  towers,  the  long  columns,  the %0a%3c lengthened  windows,  the  circular  opening  above  the %0a%3c centre  column  between  them  * ;  the  rivers  of  Paradise %0a%3c in  human  form,  the  raised  arch  at  the  bottom  of  the %0a%3c censer,  in  which  are  the  figures  of  the  evangelists, %0a%3c whether  delineated  in  likeness  of  men  or  symbolically, %0a%3c are  all  of  Byzantine  art ;  but  in  C.  61,  the  marks  of  the %0a%3c period  are  yet  stronger.  The  figures  of  the  Jewish %0a%3c prophets  fraternized  with  those  of  the  apostles,  with %0a%3c their  names  inscribed  above  the  head,  each  provided %0a%3c with  their  testimonies  ^^  that  they  may  agree  with  each %0a%3c other ;"'  the  personification  of  the  virtues,  also  with %0a%3c the  name  inscribed ;  the  Arabesques ;  are  not  only  By- %0a%3c zantine, but,  if  introduced  into  the  West,  indicate,  ac- %0a%3c cording to  M.  Didron,  an  early  period  of  the  eleventh %0a%3c century.  "  The  East,  where  the  old  law  was  bom,  al- %0a%3c ways remained  faithful  to  its  respect  for  the  Jewish %0a%3c law,  and  the  personages  of  the  Old  Testament  With %0a%3c us,  the  characters  of  the  Old  Testament,  however  ele- %0a%3c vated in  esteem  and  glory,  are  not  equivalent  to  a  saint, %0a%3c %0a%3c ^  This  description  does  not  coincide  with  the  character  of  ogival %0a%3c decoration  of  the  thirteenth  century,  which  M.  Guichard  and  the %0a%3c Abb6  Texier  attribute  to  it. %0a%3c %0a%3c ^  "  The  Greeks,  more  discoursive  than  the  natives  of  the  West, %0a%3c place  inscriptions  every  where.  This  is  a  great  advantage.  Had %0a%3c our  Gothic  ancestors  acted  thus,  we,  archaeologists,  should  have %0a%3c less  trouble  to  specify,  or  name^  personages  and  subjects  sculptured %0a%3c or  painted  in  our  churches."

"  Until  the  eleventh  century,  Latin, %0a%3c as  well  as  Greek  Christianity,  fraternized  with  the  Jew- %0a%3c ish religion,  but  from  the  moment  of  the  schism,  con-* %0a%3c summated  by  Michael  Cerularius,  this  respect  sensibly %0a%3c diminished."  ^ %0a%3c %0a%3c The  Roman  Church,  of  which  the  head,  Hildebrand, %0a%3c afterwards  Gregory  VII.,  had,  in  the  middle  of  the %0a%3c eleventh  century,  matured  the  plan  of  an  universal %0a%3c power,  the  more  frightful  because  under  the  form  of %0a%3c an  universal  theocracy,  would  not  be  likely  to  tolerate %0a%3c the  progression  and  dissemination  of  a  practice  con-* %0a%3c trary  to  its  dogmas;  Dante  did  not  appear  until  the %0a%3c fourteenth  century. %0a%3c %0a%3c M.  Guichard  remarks,  with  truth,  that  this  treatise %0a%3c belongs  to  a  period  of  transition — "  de  renouvellement %0a%3c et  de  renaissance."  This  character  is  pre-eminently %0a%3c attached,  as  I  have  endeavoured  to  show,  to  the  early %0a%3c half  of  the  eleventh  century. %0a%3c %0a%3c Who,  and  of  what  country,  was  this  artist  Monk  ?  is %0a%3c a  question  which  must  still  remain  a  problem.  Lessing, %0a%3c misled  by  a  resemblance  of  names,  was  inclined  to  at- %0a%3c tribute the  authorship  of  the  "  Diversarum  Artium %0a%3c Schedula "  to  Tutilo,  the  Monk  of  St.  Gall,  who  lived %0a%3c at  the  close  of  the  ninth  century'.  Lessing  has  not %0a%3c been  able  to  seize  from  the  text  of  Theophilus  a  single %0a%3c indication  which  militates  in  favour  of  this  high  anti- %0a%3c quity of  the  book,  and  his  argument  reduces  itself  to %0a%3c an  analogy  of  proper  names,  this  name  also  being  very %0a%3c %0a%3c ^  Didron,  Manuel  de  Flconog.

Owing  to  the  imperfect  classifi- %0a%3c cation of  these  MSS.  towards  the  end  of  the  last  cen- %0a%3c tury, this  bad  remained  unknown  or  unnoticed  until  I %0a%3c had  withdrawn  it  from  its  hiding-place ;  classed  in  the %0a%3c general  catalogue  immediately  under  the  head  of  The- %0a%3c ology, and  after  **  Theophilus  "  the  ecclesiastic,  is  found %0a%3c ^' Theophilus,  monachus;"  it  has  doubtless,  therefore, %0a%3c been  classed  with  works  on  theology.

A  treatise  "  De  Unguen- %0a%3c tis  *'  follows ;  it  is  a  collection  of  medical  recipes.  The %0a%3c title  and  preface  to  the  first  book  are  unfortunately %0a%3c wanting ;  in  so  voluminous  and  superior  a  copy  some- %0a%3c thing might  have  been  otherwise  adduced  from  these %0a%3c which  would  have  unravelled  the  mystery  which  shrouds %0a%3c the  age  and  country  of  our  author. %0a%3c %0a%3c That  this  MS.  is  likewise  but  a  copy  from  an  older %0a%3c work  is  proved  by  the  variations  it  presents  from  the %0a%3c Vienna  and  Wolfenbiittel  MSS.,  supplying  many  omis- %0a%3c sions, claiming  also  the  restoration  of  a  few  which  I %0a%3c have  carefully  noted  during  the  progress  of  the  work. %0a%3c The  four  chapters  missing  in  the  second  book  (see %0a%3c Index,  p.  110),  have  probably  been  cut  from  the  ori- %0a%3c ginal, as  no  lacuna  is  left  by  the  scribe  in  this. %0a%3c %0a%3c It  will  be  observed  upon  perusal  that  the  whole  of %0a%3c the  work,  from  C.  LXXXI.  L.  III.  p.  345,  is  new. %0a%3c It  had  been  hitherto  lost ;  the  promises  held  out  in  the %0a%3c preface  to  the  First  Book  are  fulfilled. %0a%3c %0a%3c The  Third  Book  has  evidently  been  treated  by %0a%3c Theophilus  with  more  care  and  attachment  than  the %0a%3c others.  The  eloquent  preface,  the  labour  expended  in %0a%3c description,  and  the  great  volume  of  the  work  upon %0a%3c metals,  attest  this.

The  description  of  this %0a%3c instrument  is  now  rendered  complete  ^  as  it  existed  in %0a%3c the  time  of  our  author.  An  important  description  of %0a%3c the  manner  of  founding  bells  follows.  The  next,  "  Of %0a%3c Musical  Cymbals,"  tends  to  show  the  antiquity  of  the %0a%3c author.  Our  monk  treats  of  the  more  humble  vessels, %0a%3c made  of  tin ;  of  iron,  with  a  description  of  the  apparatus %0a%3c employed  in  Damascus  work  upon  steel.  Then  follows %0a%3c a  description  of  the  Italian  work  promised  in  the  pre- %0a%3c face to  the  whole  work,  of  sculpturing,  gilding  and %0a%3c staining  ivory ;  of  gems,  pearls  and  electra.  It  should %0a%3c be  remarked  here  that  Theophilus  quotes  Eraclius,  a %0a%3c strong  argument  against  his  Italian  origin.  The  monk %0a%3c would  here  appear  to  have  travelled,  note-book  in  hand, %0a%3c to  collect  the  various  arts  from  different  countries. %0a%3c The  passage  in  the  preface  to  the  Second  Book,  which %0a%3c I  have  preferred  to  translate  literally,  rather  than  to %0a%3c take  in  the  allegorical  sense,  in  which  it  has  been %0a%3c hitherto  received,  and  which  the  character  and  writings %0a%3c of  Theophilus  do  not  warrant,  affords  strong  presump- %0a%3c tion that  Theophilus  was  no  Greek  monk,  which  his %0a%3c description  of  the  "fistula,"  the  reed  or  pipe  formerly %0a%3c used  by  the  Roman  Church  in  the  celebration  of  the %0a%3c sacrament,  confirms:  "  apprehendi  atrium  Agi^B^  or  "ife- %0a%3c gi(B  SophicBy  conspicorque  celludam  diversorum  colorum %0a%3c omnimoda  varietate  refertam  et  monstrantem  singur %0a%3c lorum  utilttatem  ac  naturam.

Van  Mander*, %0a%3c that  painting  in  oil  had  been  the  discovery  of  the %0a%3c brothers  John  and  Hubert  Van  Eyck,  in  1410. %0a%3c %0a%3c This  statement  has  been  so  completely  refuted  that %0a%3c further  labour  is  needless  on  this  point.  Horace %0a%3c Walpole,  the  Rev.  Mr.  Bentham,  and  Mr.  Smith,  have %0a%3c shown  that  the  art  of  painting  in  oil  was  practised  in %0a%3c our  own  country  from  an  early  period  up  to  the  fifteenth %0a%3c %0a%3c indiscriminately;  the  side  colonnades  and  porticus  afforded  shelter %0a%3c to  the  catechumens  and  penitents,  aud  such  others  as  were  not %0a%3c allowed  to  advance  beyond  the  threshold  of  the  church  itself.

The  passages  from  Eraclius  and  Cennino, %0a%3c which  I  have  given  in  the  above-named  notes,  are  suflS- %0a%3c cient  to  prove  that  the  art  of  using  driers  with  oil  in %0a%3c the  process  of  painting,  so  as  to  render  the  work  less %0a%3c tedious,  was  likewise  known  previously  to  the  time  of %0a%3c Van  Eyck ;  the  opinion  of  Raspe  \  in  which  M.  Guichard %0a%3c coincides,  is  not  therefore  tenable. %0a%3c %0a%3c A  third  supposition  was  started  by  Emeric  David  *, %0a%3c that  painting  in  oil,  having  been  abandoned  in  the %0a%3c tenth  or  eleventh  century,  had  been  invented  anew  in %0a%3c the  fifteenth  by  John  Van  Eyck.  This  is  open  to  equal %0a%3c objection,  as  the  English  authors  referred  to  above  have %0a%3c shown ;  and  it  is  singular  that  some  of  the  materials %0a%3c used  for  the  purpose  of  painting  the  chapel  of  St. %0a%3c Stephen,  in  1350,  were  procured  from  Bruges:  "the %0a%3c sum  of  four  shillings  and  ten  pence  was  paid  to  '  Lomyn %0a%3c de  Bruges '  for  six  pounds  and  a  half  of  white  varnish, %0a%3c at  nine  pence  per  pound." %0a%3c %0a%3c Yet  that  Van  Eyck  merely  pursued  the  path  which %0a%3c had  been  previously  trodden,  no  one  can  admit  who %0a%3c has  compared  his  works  even  with  those  of  modern %0a%3c times,  which  we  know  to  have  been  painted  with  oil %0a%3c simply,  (the  more  ancient  works  having  disappeared %0a%3c partly  on  that  account,  and  partly  from  the  class  of %0a%3c colours  in  use,  as  will  be  seen  by  a  reference  to  notes %0a%3c %0a%3c ^  See  note -on  "Gummi  Fornis,"  p.  71  of  this  work.

I.  p.  63,  of  what  th^ %0a%3c varnish  of  Theophilus  was  composed,  and  which  was %0a%3c employed  during  the  early  period  of  art,  there  is  every %0a%3c reason  to  believe  that  "  Amber  Varnish  "  was  one  of %0a%3c the  inventions  of  the  brothers  Van  Eyck ;  and  that  this %0a%3c invention  was  carried  into  the  school  of  Venice  we  have %0a%3c proofs  The  head  of  a  Venetian  Doge,  by  John  Bellini, %0a%3c in  the  National  Gallery,  is  painted  with  this  varnish. %0a%3c Mr.  Eastlake  pointed  out  to  me  the  amber  beads %0a%3c hanging  upon  the  wall,  in  the  picture  by  Van  Eyck, %0a%3c in  the  same  place :  this  is  a  curious  circumstance  worth %0a%3c notice. %0a%3c %0a%3c In  the  manuscript,  Sloane  845,  PI.  86  C,  which %0a%3c contains  a  series  of  medical  writings,  "  Tract.  Var.  Me- %0a%3c dicinal." collected  by  Johannes  Ketham,  who  flourished %0a%3c towards  the  latter  part  of  the  fifteenth  century,  is  a %0a%3c book  upon  colours  and  materials  for  painting,  written  in %0a%3c old  Dutch  or  Flemish,  and  which  should  therefore  be  of %0a%3c an  earlier  period  in  the  same  centuiy.  In  this  I  found %0a%3c the  first  mention  of  amber  varnish  yet  upon  record,  and %0a%3c it  arrives  from  the  country  of  Van  Eyck.  The  MS.  is %0a%3c extremely  diflScuIt  to  read. %0a%3c %0a%3c "  Stibstancie  tmaken  doer  aUe  TVni  indinz. %0a%3c %0a%3c "Be  lib  lyn  olys  end  sidz  een  ure  end  dan  nemt  viii. %0a%3c loet  bemsteen  ghepidvirt  end  doen  dy  yn  een  erden  poot %0a%3c ende  ghiten  dar  op  lyn  cly  dy  voer  gesad  is  dot  dy %0a%3c tvynstey  bedowe  ys  myt  den  oly  end  laten  dat  syden  also %0a%3c langhe  dat  de  bemsteen  gesmont'  ys  dy  bemsteen  soe %0a%3c salmet'  sy  ghen  doer  een  doeck  eh  doent  tostS  irst'  oly %0a%3c %0a%3c ^  I  shall  have  better  opportunity  and  more  space  to  treat  upon %0a%3c this  in  a  work,  preparing,  to  which  I  have  before  alluded.

The  works  of  the  Arab  chemists  had  be- %0a%3c come known;  Albertus  Magnus,  Roger  Bacon,  Arnold %0a%3c of  Villa  Nova,  Raymond  LuJly,  had  all  lived  and  written %0a%3c upon  the  "  Magnum  Opus,"  the  basis  of  which  rested %0a%3c upon  sublimation  and  distillation,  by  means  of  which %0a%3c the  elixir,  spirit,  or  excellence  of  all  things  were  to  be %0a%3c extracted.  The  words  of  Lomazzo,  which  we  have %0a%3c quoted  above,  would  therefore  probably  bear  a  literal %0a%3c meaning. %0a%3c %0a%3c Leonardo  da  Vinci  is  stated  to  have  followed  the %0a%3c manner  of  colouring  invented  by  John  of  Bruges,  and %0a%3c to  have  thinned  his  oil  by  means  of  alembics.  This,  I %0a%3c was  convinced,  intended,  that  Leonardo  distilled  the  oil %0a%3c (he  himself  mentions  walnut  oil)  for  the  purpose  of %0a%3c painting. %0a%3c %0a%3c Aware  that  the  older  Italian  writers  used  the  word %0a%3c **  lamiicco  "  as  representing  any  chemical  apparatus,  yet %0a%3c %0a%3c ^  The  materials  employed  are  1  tb  linseed  oil,  fyn  olys ;  4  ounces %0a%3c of  amber  in  powder,  bernsteen  ghepulviri  ;  (a  loet  is  half  an  ounce,) %0a%3c and  1  pound  litharge,  spigelhars.  The  amber  is  dissolved  with  a  ^^^^  ytxy^ %0a%3c little  oil  over  the  fire ;  when  dissolved,  the  oil  is  added  hot  by %0a%3c degrees  ;  the  litharge,  of  which  an  enormous  quantity  is  added,  is  >t.jC^^%3c^ %0a%3c then  put  in;  it  is  cooked  a  little,  and  is  finished.  There  were %0a%3c various  modes  of  making  this  varnish  practised  in  Italy  at  a  later %0a%3c period.  The  process  here  described  would  make  a  very  dark %0a%3c ▼arnish,  which  would  require  to  be  thinned  with  walnut  or  other %0a%3c oil  for  use. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c XZXIV  PREFACE. %0a%3c %0a%3c baving  always  found  that  by  stiUare  or  assotiglmre  per %0a%3c lambicco  distillation  was  intended,  while  filtration  was  de- %0a%3c scribed as  distiUare  perfeltrOy  it  became  necessary  to  seek %0a%3c for  any  precedent  that  distilled  linseed,  or  walnut  oil, %0a%3c was  used  in  the  art  of  painting,  experimenting,  at  the %0a%3c same  time,  at  home.  I  was  fortunate  enough  to  suc- %0a%3c ceed in  both  instances  \ %0a%3c %0a%3c ^  I  think  it  better  to  give  the  result  of  the  experiment  as  I  noted %0a%3c it  down  at  the  time  it  was  tried,  without  further  comment  than  that %0a%3c it  is  one  which  should  be  attempted  by  no  inexperienced  hands ; %0a%3c the  explosive  nature  of  the  gas  produced  rendering  the  process %0a%3c highly  dangerous  to  an  unskilful  person,  although  a  very  simple %0a%3c and  easy  one  to  the  chemist,  or  other  operator. %0a%3c %0a%3c Walnut  Oil  :  its  Distllation. — March,  184-5,  and  July  25, 1845. %0a%3c %0a%3c .  4  oz.  distilled  in  a  glass  retort  and  receiver,  over  a  small  char- %0a%3c coal (ire  without  flame. %0a%3c %0a%3c Water  was  the  first  product ;  then  came  over  a  light-coloured %0a%3c empyreumatic  oil,  which  gradually  became  of  a  darker  colour, %0a%3c mixed  with  water  during  the  whole  process  of  distillation. %0a%3c %0a%3c The  ebullition  in  tlie  retort  was  at  first  great,  but  it  gradually %0a%3c lessened  as  the  oil  became  of  greater  substance.  The  heat  is  required %0a%3c to  be  increased  to  keep  up  the  vapour  producing  the  distilled  oil. %0a%3c As  the  process  continued,  this  vapour  became  more  abundant,  and %0a%3c a  quantity  of  gas  was  liberated,  to  allow  of  the  escape  of  which  the %0a%3c stopper  in  the  receiver  must  be  greased  and  loosely  dropped  into %0a%3c its  place;  care  should  be  taken  to  visit  this  often,  in  order  to  guard %0a%3c against  explosion.  It  appears  to  me  during  this  process  that  oil %0a%3c will  not  spontaneously  take  fire  at  a  great  heat;  it  requires  contact %0a%3c with  flame  or  a  red  heat  in  order  to  do  so. %0a%3c %0a%3c Carbonic  acid  and  carhureiied  hydrogen  gas  are  the  principal %0a%3c gases  produced.  This  mixture  of  gases,  probably  owing  to  the %0a%3c great  excess  of  carburetted  hydrogen,  is  highly  inflammable :  it  is %0a%3c the  production  of  this,  not  of  a  highly  inflammable  volatile  oil, %0a%3c which  causes  oil,  raised  to  a  very  high  temperature,  to  take  fire %0a%3c when  in  contact  with  flame,  or  highly  heated  bodies,  such  as  red- %0a%3c hot  iron,  &c. %0a%3c %0a%3c Volatile  oils  of  two  specific  gravities  were  produced ;  the  first %0a%3c (before  an  increased  temperature  was  given  to  the  retort)  was  of  a %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c PREKA.CB.  XXZT %0a%3c %0a%3c The  earliest  mention  I  find  of  distilled  linseed  oil  is %0a%3c in  conjunction  with  amber  varnish;  it  is  to  be  used  as %0a%3c a  varnish,  or  glaze,  upon  painted  subjects,  and  it  is  con- %0a%3c tained in  a  collection  of  recipes  relative  to  the  Arts, %0a%3c %0a%3c less  specific  gravity,  and  also  of  a  lighter  colour  than  that  which %0a%3c follows,  and  it  forms  a  stratum  upon  the  darker  and  denser  vola- %0a%3c tile oil.  The  darker  volatile  oil  is  of  the  colour  of  pale  amber, %0a%3c the  lighter  a  very  pale  straw  colour,  almost  colourless.  They %0a%3c unite  by  agitation,  as  also  will  the  small  quantity  of  water,  if  the  oil %0a%3c is  not  carefully  decanted  from  it. %0a%3c %0a%3c Memorandum,  October  £8,  1845. %0a%3c %0a%3c This  distilled  or  empyreumatic  oil  should  be  kept  in  a  jar  covered %0a%3c with  muslin  so  as  merely  to  keep  out  dust  and  dirt,  but  to  allow  the %0a%3c entrance  of  air  and  the  escape  of  the  empyreuma.  In  a  short  time %0a%3c this  oil,  which  is  at  first  so  pungent  and  offensive,  becomes  gradu- %0a%3c ally of  less  powerful  odour,  and  in  a  few  weeks  is  not  of  more  un- %0a%3c pleasant smell  than  boiled  linseed  oil.  It  appears  to  absorb  oxy- %0a%3c gen by  contact  with  air^  and  at  a  temperature  of  4*0^,  F.  becomes %0a%3c flocculent  in  appearance,  while  at  70°,  F.  it  remains  transparent. %0a%3c This  is  not  a  deposition  of  stearine,  but  the  effect  of  a  diminution %0a%3c of  temperature,  the  absence  of  heat  causing  it  to  become  solid,  as  is %0a%3c the  case  with  many  distilled  oils,  at  that  temperature. %0a%3c %0a%3c Amber  varnish,  (and  probably  other  thick  oil  varnishes,)  would %0a%3c be  equally  benefited  thinned  with  this  distilled  oil ;  it  dries  with- %0a%3c out a  pellicle  when  mixed  with  colours.  Colours  used  for  finish- %0a%3c ing a  picture,  such  as  in  the  light  for  solid  painting,  or  glazing  for %0a%3c colour  and  shadows,  are  rendered  very  pure,  and  without  the %0a%3c slightest  appearance  of  a  skin,  although  it  may  be  plentifully  used. %0a%3c It  dries  much  more  slowly  than  any  other  distilled  oil,  and  hence %0a%3c its  great  value,  as  it  allows  the  artist  as  much  time  as  he  requires %0a%3c in  order  to  blend  his  colours  and  finish  his  work.  In  conjunction %0a%3c with  amber  varnish  it  forms  a  vehicle  which  leaves  nothing  to  be %0a%3c desired,  and  which  doubtless  was  the  vehicle  of  Van  Eyck,  and %0a%3c in  many  instances  of  the  Venetian  masters»  and  of  Correggio,  the %0a%3c different  modes  of  painting  necessarily  producing  the  varied  appear- %0a%3c ances of  the  different  schools  and  masters. %0a%3c %0a%3c c  2 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c XXXVl  PREFACB. %0a%3c %0a%3c made  by  a  monk  of  the  order  of  Jesus,  contained  in %0a%3c the  Lucca  Ed.  1577'. %0a%3c %0a%3c **  A  far  un  liqtwre  et  vi  usa  da  dove  p.  vemice  sopra %0a%3c le  figure.
