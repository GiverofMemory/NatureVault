Acid activation destroys these bonds leaving the silicate and aluminate to be loosely associated [[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0169131716301946|#]].  Not exactly sure why this makes the clay settle faster in water.  So it removes the cations causing more of a negative charge, which makes it bind to contaminants better.%0a\ No newline at end of file%0a

Basically you add high concentration acid to dry clay powder and cook as hot as possible as long as possible.  Then wash very thoroughly.%0a
