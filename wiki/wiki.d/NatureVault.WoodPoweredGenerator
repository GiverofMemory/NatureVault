Regulation of water on intake can be done with capillary tubes or even with an injector or steam in order to prevent the slag forming at the bottom from melted ash and water. Also instead of precisely sizing the nozzle, you can have a valve to adjust the flow on the fly.  Also a fine mesh cone at the bottom ofthe 55 gal drum would probably help the both processes, the carbonization and chargas generation.  Perhaps the same device can be used for both.
