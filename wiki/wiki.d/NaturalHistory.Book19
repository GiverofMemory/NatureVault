What department is there to be found of %0aactive life in which flax is not employed ? and in what pro¬ %0aduction of the earth are there greater marvels® revealed to ns %0a%0a* More particularly in B. xvii. cc. 2 and 3, and B. xviii. cc. 57—75. %0a%0a2 The Linum usitatissimum of Linnaeus. %0a%0a3 What would he have said to the application of the powers of steam, %0aand the electric telegraph %0a%0aTOL. iV.

To think that here is a plant which brings %0aEgypt in close proximity to Italy!—so much so, in fact, that %0aGalerius* and Balbillus,® both of them prefects of Egypt, made %0athe passage to Alexandria from the Straits of Sicily, the one %0ain six days, the other in five! It was only this very last sum¬ %0amer, that Valerius Marianus, a senator of praetorian rank, %0areached Alexandria from Puteoli in eight days, and that, too, %0awith a very moderate breeze all the time ! To think that %0ahere is a plant which brings Gades, situate near the Pillars of %0aHercules, within six days of Ostia, Nearer Spain within three, %0athe province of Gallia Narbonensis within two, and Africa %0awithin one !—this last passage having been made by C. Fla¬ %0avius, when legatus of Vibius Crispus, the proconsul, and that, %0atoo, with but little or no wind to favour his passage ! %0a%0aVTiat audacity in man! What criminal perverseness ! thus %0ato sow a thing in the ground for the purpose of catching the %0awinds and the tempests, it being not enough for him, forsooth, %0ato be borne upon the waves alone! Nay, still more than this, %0asails even that are bigger than the very ships themselves will %0anot sufiice for him, and although it takes a Avhole tree to %0amake a mast to carry the cross-yards, above those cross-yards %0asails upon sails must still be added, with others swelling at the %0aprow and at the stern as well—so many devices, in fact, to %0achallenge death! Only to think, in fine, that that which %0amoves to and fro, as it were, the various countries of the earth, %0ashould spring from a seed so minute, and make its appearance %0ain a stem so fine, so little elevated above the surface of the %0aearth ! And then, besides, it is not in all its native strength %0athat it is employed for the purposes of a tissue; no, it must %0afirst be rent asunder, and then tawed and beaten, till it is %0areduced to the softness of wool; indeed, it is only by such %0aviolence done to its nature, and prompted by the extreme %0aaudacity of man, and* * * * that it is rendered subser¬ %0a%0avient to his purposes. The inventor of this art has been %0a%0aPossibly Galerius Trachalus, Consul a.d. 68, a relation of Galeria %0aFundana, the wife of the Emperor Vitellius. %0a%0a^ Governor of Egypt in the reign of Nero, a.d. 55. lie is mentionoJ %0aby Seneca, Quaest. Nat. B. iv. c. 2, and is supposed to have written a work %0aon Egypt and his journeys in that country. %0a%0a® Or, as Sillig suggests, ‘‘after ill treatment such as this, that it arrives %0aat the sea.” The passage is evidently defective. %0a%0a%0aChap. 2.] %0a%0a%0aHOW FLAX IS SOWN. %0a%0a%0aISl %0a%0a%0aalready mentioned by us on a more appropriate occasionnot %0asatisfied that his fellow-men should perish upon land, but %0aanxious that they should meet their end with no sepulchral %0arites to await them, there are no execrations® to be found that %0acan equal his demerits ! %0a%0aIt is only in the preceding Book ® that I was warning the %0aagriculturist, as he values the grain that is to form our daily %0asustenance, to be on his guard against the storm and the tem¬ %0apest ; and yet, here we have man sowing with his own hand, %0aman racking his invention how best to gather, an object the %0aonly aspirations of which upon the deep are the winds of %0aheaven ! And then, too, as if to let us understand aU. the better %0ahow highly favoured is this instrument of our punishment, %0athere is no vegetable production that grows with greater fa¬ %0acility and, to prove to us that it is in despite of Jfature her¬ %0aself that it exists, it has the property of scorching “ the ground %0awhere it is grown, and of deteriorating the quality of the very %0asoil itself. %0a%0a%0aCHAP. 2. (1.) —HOW FLAX IS SOWN: TWENTY-SEVEN PHINCIPAL %0aVARIETIES OF IT. %0a%0aBlax is mostly sown in sandy soils, and after a single %0aploughing only. There is no plant that grows more rapidly %0a%0a’’ In B. vii. c. 57. lie alludes to Daedalus. %0a%0a® He probably has in view here the imprecation uttered by Horace :— %0a%0a“ Illi robur, et ses triplex %0aCirca pectus erat, qui fragilem truer %0aCommisit pelago ratem.”— Odes, i. 3. %0a%0aAt the present day hemp forms a material part in the manufacture of %0asails. In addition to flax, the ancients employed broom, rushes, leather, %0aand various skins of animals for the purpose. %0a%0a9 In c. 76. %0a%0aOn the contrary, as Fee observes, the cultivation of flax is attended %0awith the greatest difficulties. %0a%0aSee B. xvii. c. 7. Virgil says, Georg, i. 77, “Urit enim lini campum %0aseges”—but in the sense, as Fee remarks, of exhausting, not searching the %0asoil. %0a%0a*9 A light soil, and well manured, is usually employed for the purpose. %0aColumella, B. ii. c. 10, recommends a rich, moist soil. It is sown in March %0aor April, and is gathered, according to the season, from June to September. %0a%0a19 Tlioiigh rapid in its growth, there ai’e many vegetable productions %0athat grow more rapidly. %0a%0a%0a132 %0a%0a%0aflint’s natural history. %0a%0a%0a[Bool; XIX. %0a%0a%0athan this; sown in spring,“ it is pulled up in surnmer, and is, %0afor this reason as well, productive of considerable injury to the %0asoil.'® There may be some, however, who would forgive %0aEgypt for growing it, as it is by its aid that she imports the %0amerchandize of Arabia and India; but why should the Gallic %0aprovinces base any of their reputation upon this product ?‘® Is %0ait not enough, forsooth, for them to be separated by mountains %0afrom the sea, and to have, upon the side on which they aro %0abounded by the Ocean, that void and empty space, as it is %0acalled ? ” The Cadurci,^® the Caleti, the Kuteni,'® the Ihtu- %0ariges,*® and the Morini,-* those remotest of all mankind, as it is %0asupposed, the whole of the Gallic provinces, in fact, are in the %0ahabit of weaving sail-cloth; and at the present day our ene¬ %0amies even, who dwell beyond the Ehenus, have learned to do the %0asame ; indeed, there is no tissue that is more beautiful in the %0aeyes of their females than linen. I am here reminded of the %0afact, that we find it stated by M. Varro, that it is a custom %0apeculiar to the family of the Serrani for the women never to %0awear garments of linen. In Germany it is in caves^® deep under¬ %0aground that the linen-weavers ply their work ; and the same %0ais the case, too, in the Alian territory, in Italy, between the %0arivers Padus and Ticinus, the linen of which holds the third %0arank among the kinds manufactured in Europe, that of S®ta- %0abis claiming the first, and those of Retovium^® and of Eaven- %0a%0aThis was the time for sowing it with the Romans, though in some %0acountries, at the present day, it is sown so late as tlie autumn. %0a%0aIn B. xviii. c. 72, he has spoken of this method of gathering vege¬ %0atable productions as injurious to the soil, hy withdrawing its natmal %0ajuices. %0a%0a“ Censentur hoc reditu ?” There is little doubt that the Gauls, like %0atheir German neighbours, cultivated flax for the purposes of female dress, %0aand not mainly for the manufacture of sails. %0a%0a“ Quod vocant inane.” He implies that the boundless space of %0aocean on the Western coasts of Gaul was useless for any purposes of navi¬ %0agation. %0a%0aSee B. iv. c. 33. See B. iv. c. 33. %0a%0aSee B. xxxiv. c. 48. %0a%0a22 A family of the Atilia gens. %0a%0a23 It was, and is still to some extent, a prevalent opinion, that the hu¬ %0amidity of caves under-ground is favourable to the manufacture of tissues %0aof hemp and flax. %0a%0a2* In Spain. See B. i. c. 1, and B. iii. c. 4. %0a%0a25 Cluvier takes this place to be the same with Lituhium in Liguria, %0amentioned by Livy, B. xxxii. %0a%0a%0aChap. 2.] %0a%0a%0aPRINCIPAL TARIETIE5 OP FLAX. %0a%0a%0a133 %0a%0a%0atia, in the yicinity of Alia, on the -^Emilian Way, the second, %0aplace in general estimation. The linens of Faventia are pre¬ %0aferred for whiteness to those of Alia, which are always un¬ %0ableached : those of Retovium are remarkable for their extreme %0afineness, combined with substance, and are quite equal in %0awhiteness to the linens of Faventia; but they have none of %0athat fine downy nap upon them, which is so highly esteemed %0aby some persons, though equally disliked by others. A thread %0ais made, too, from their flax, of considerable strength, smoother %0aand more even, almost, than the spider’s web; when tested %0awith the teeth, it emits a sharp, clear twang; hence it is, that %0ait sells at double the price of the other kinds. %0a%0aBut it is the province of Nearer Spain that produces a linen %0aof the greatest lustre, an advantage which it owes to the waters %0aof a stream which washes the city of Tarraco” there. The fine¬ %0aness, too, of t|iis linen is quite marvellous, and here it is that %0athe first manufactories of cambric'® were established. From %0athe same province, too, of Spain, the flax of Zoela has of late %0ayears been introduced into Italy, and has been found extremely %0aserviceable for the manufacture of hunting-nets. Zoela is a %0acity of Callfficia, in the vicinity of the Ocean. The flax, too, %0aof Cumae, in Campania, has its own peculiar merits in the %0amanufacture of nets for fishing and fowling ; it is employed, %0aalso, for making hunting-nets. For it is from flax, in fact, %0athat we prepare various textures, destined to be no less insi¬ %0adious to the brute creation than they are to ourselves. It is %0awith toils made from the flax of Cum® that wild boars are %0ataken, the meshes being proof against their bristles,®® equally %0awith the edge of the knife : before now, too, we have seen some %0aof these toils of a fineness so remarkable®^ as to allow of being %0a%0a“ Lanugo.” This is not generally looked upon as a merit in linen, at %0atlie present day. %0a%0aNow Tarragona. See B. iii. c. 4. %0a%0a“ Carbasus.” This was probably the Spanish name originally for fine %0aflax, and henee came to signify the eambrics, or fine linen tissues made of %0ait. It seems, however, to have afterwards been extended to all kinds of %0alinen tissues, as we find the name given indifferently to linen garments, %0asail-cloth, and awnings for the theatres. %0a%0a” See B. iii. c. 4. %0a%0a“ Ssetas ceu per ferri aciem vincunt.” This passage is probably in a %0amutilated state. %0a%0aThere must cither be some corruption in the text, or else Pliny must %0ahave been mistaken. Nets such as these could have been of no possible %0ause in taking a wild boar. %0a%0a%0a134 %0a%0a%0aPliny's natuual history. %0a%0a%0a[Book XIX. %0a%0a%0apassed through a man’s ring, running ropes and all, a single %0aindividual being able to carry an amount of nets sufficient to %0aenviron a whole forest—a thing which we know to have been %0adone not long ago by Julius Lupus, w'ho died prefect of Egypt. %0aThis, however, is nothing very surprising, but it really is quite %0awonderful that each of the cords was composed of no less %0athan one hundred and fifty threads. Those, no doubt, will be %0aastonished at this, who are not aware that there is preserved %0ain the Temple of Minerva, at Lindus, in the Isle of llhodes, %0athe cuirass of a former king of Egypt, Amasis by name, each %0athread employed in the texture of which is composed of three %0ahundred aud sixty-five other threads. Mucianus, who was %0athree times consul, informs us that he saw this curiosity very %0arecently, though there was but little then remaining of it, in %0aconsequence of the injury it had experienced at the hands of %0avarious persons who had tried to verify the fact. Italy, too, %0aholds the flax of the Peligni in high esteem, though it is only %0aemployed by fullers; there is no kind known that is whiter %0athan this, or which bears a closer resemblance to wool. That %0agrown by the CadurcP^ is held in high estimation for making %0amattresses;^^ which, as well as flock,are an invention for which %0awe are indebted to the Gauls : the ancient usage of Italy is %0astill kept in remembrance in the word “ stramentum,”®* the %0aname given by us to beds stuffed with straw. %0a%0aThe flax of Egypt, though the least strong^® of all as a tissue, %0ais that from which the greatest profits are derived. There are %0afour varieties of it, the Tanitic, the Pelusiac, the Putic, and %0athe Tentyritic—so called from the various districts in which %0athey are respectively grown. The upper part of Eg5rpt, in %0athe vicinity of Arabia, produces a shrub, known by some as %0a“ gossypium,” ” but by most persons as “xylon;” hence the %0a%0a32 See B. iv. c. 33. Now Querci, the chief town of which is Cahors. %0a%0a33 “Culcit®.” 3^ “Tomenta.” %0a%0a33 Exactly corresponding to our “paillasse,” a “bed of straw.” %0a%0a36 This is doubtful, though at the same time it is a well-known fact that %0athe Egyptian flax grows to the greatest size. Hasselquist speaks of it %0aattaining a height of fifteen feet. %0a%0a^ 37 Our cotton, the Gossypium arhoreum of Linnmus. See B. xii. c. 21. %0aThe terms xylon, byssus, and gossypium, must be regarded as synonymous, %0abeing applied sometimes to the plant, sometimes to the raw cotton, and %0asometimes to the tissues made from it. Gossypium was probably the bar¬ %0abarous name of the cotton tree, and byssus perhaps a corruption of its %0aHebrew name. %0a%0a%0aChap. 3.] THE MODE OF PREPAKIKG FLAX. 135 %0a%0aname of “ xylina,” given to the tissues that are manufactured %0afrom it. The shrub is small, and bears a fruit, similar in %0aappearance to a nut with a beard, and containing in the inside %0aa silky substance, the down of which is spun into threads. %0aThere is no tissue known, that is superior to those made from %0athis thread, either for whiteness, softness, or dressing: the %0amost esteemed vestments worn by the priests of Egypt are %0amade of it. There is a fourth kind of tissue, known by the %0aname of “othouinura,” which is made from a kind of marsh- %0areed,®® the panicule only being employed for the purpose. In %0aAsia, again, there is a thread made from broom,®® which is %0aemployed in the construction of fishing-nets, being found to %0abe remarkably durable; for the purpose of preparing it, the %0ashrub is steeped in water for ten days. The -Ethiopians, also, %0aand the people of India, prepare a kind of thread from a fruit %0awhich resembles our apple, and the Arabians, as already" men¬ %0ationed, from gourds that grow upon trees. %0a%0aCHAP. 3. —THE MODE OF PKEPAEING FLAX. %0a%0aIn our part of the world the ripeness of flax is usually %0aascertained by two signs, the swelling of the seed, and its %0aassuming a yellowish tint. It is then pulled up by the roots, %0amade up into small sheaves that will just fill the hand, and %0ahung to dry in the sun. It is suspended with the roots %0aupwards the first day, and then for the five following days the %0aheads of the sheaves are placed, reclining one against the other, %0ain such a way that the seed which drops out may fall into the %0amiddle. Linseed is employed for various medicinal"’ purposes, %0aand it is used by the country-people of Italy beyond the Padus %0ain a certain kind of food, which is remarkable for its sweet- %0a%0aProbably the Arundo donax of modern botanists. See B. xvi. c. 66. %0a%0aFee says, that the people of Pisa, at the present day, soak the stalks %0aof broom, and extract therefrom a thread, of which cords and coarse stuffs %0aarc made. %0a%0aIn B. xii. c. 21. He seems there to speak of the cotton-tree, though' %0aFee suggests that he may possibly allude to the “ Bombax pentandrum” of %0aLinnaeus. %0a%0aIt is the mucilage of the perisperm that is so useful in medicine. %0aAs an article of food, the farina of linseed is held in no esteem whatever. %0aIn times of scarcity, attempts have been made to mix it with flour or meal, %0abut the result has been found to be heavy and indigestible, and has caused, %0ait is said, the death even of those who have eaten of it in considerable %0aquantities. %0a%0a%0a136 %0a%0a%0aPliny’s natueal histoet. %0a%0a%0a[Book XIX. %0a%0a%0aness : for this long time past, however, it has only been in gene¬ %0aral use for sacrifices offered to the divinities. After the wheat %0aharvest is over, the stalks of flax are plunged in water that %0ahas been warmed in the sun, and are then submitted to pres¬ %0asure with a weight; for there,is nothing known that is more %0alight and buoyant than this. When the outer coat is loosened, %0ait is a sign that the stalks have been sufficiently steeped ; after %0awhich^^ they are again turned with the heads downwards, and %0aleft to dry as before in the sun : when thoroughly dried, they %0aare beaten with a tow-mallet on a stone. %0a%0aThe part that lies nearest to the outer coat is knowE by the %0aname of “stuppa;” it is a flax of inferior quality, and is %0amostly employed for making the wicks of lamps. This, how¬ %0aever, requires to be combed out with iron hatchels, until the %0awhole of the oiiter skin is removed. The inner part presents %0anumerous varieties of flax, esteemed respectively in propor¬ %0ation to their whiteness and their softness. Spinning flax is %0aheld^ to be an honourable^^ employment for men even: the %0ahusks, or outer coats, are employed for heating furnaces and %0aovens. There is a certain amount of skill required in hatchel- %0aling flax and dressing it: it is a fair proportion for fifty pounds %0ain the sheaf to yield fifteen pounds of flax combed out. When %0aspun into thread, it is rendered additionally supple by being %0asoaked in water and then beaten out upon a stone; and after %0ait is woven into a tissue, it is again beaten with heavy maces: %0aindeed, the more roughly it is treated the better it is. %0a%0aCHAP. 4. —LINEN MADE OP ASBESTOS. %0a%0aThere has been invented also a kind of linen which is in¬ %0acombustible by flame. It is generally knoAvn as live”^® linen, %0aand I have seen, before now, napkins that were made of it %0a%0aThere are various other methods employed of dressing flax at the %0apresent day ; but they are all of them long and tedious. %0a%0aAnd not feminine or servile. %0a%0a43 “ Vivum.” %0a%0a^ He evidently considers asbestus, or amianthus, to he a vegetable, and %0anot a mineral production. It is, in reality, a mineral, with long flexible %0afilaments, of a silky appearance, and is composed of silica, magnesia, and %0alime. The wicks of the inextinguishable lamps of the middle ages, the %0aexistence of which was an article of general belief, were said to be made %0aof asbestus. Paper and lace, even, have been made of it in modem %0atimes. %0a%0a%0aCbap. 4.] %0a%0a%0aLINEN MADE OE ASBESTOS. %0a%0a%0a137 %0a%0a%0athrown into a blazing fire, in the room where the guests were %0aat table, and after the stains were burnt out, come forth from %0athe flames w'hiter and cleaner than they could possibly have %0abeen rendered by the aid of water. It is from this material %0athat the corpse-cloths of monarchs are made, to ensure the %0aseparation of the ashes of the body from those of the pile. %0aThis substance grows^® in the deserts o'f India,^® scorched by %0athe burning rays of the sun: here, where no rain is ever %0aknown to fall, and amid multitudes of deadly serpents, it be¬ %0acomes habituated to resist the action of fire. Rarely to be %0afound, it presents considerable difficulties in weaving it into a %0atissue, in consequence of its shortness; its colour is naturally %0ared, and it only becomes Avhite through the agency of fire. %0aBy those who find it, it is sold at prices equal to those given %0afor the finest pearls ; by the Greeks it is called “ asbestinon,”^’ %0aa name which indicates its peculiar properties. Anaxilaiis^® %0amakes a statement to the effect that if a tree is surrounded %0aAvith linen made of this substance, the noise of the blows %0agiven by the axe will be deadened thereby, and that the tree may %0abe cut down without their being heard. For these qualities it %0ais that this linen occupies the very highest rank among all the %0akinds that are known. %0a%0aThe next rank is accorded to the tissue known as “ byssus,”^® %0aan article which is held in the very highest estimation by %0afemales, and is produced in the vicinity of Elis, in Achaia.®° I %0afind it stated by some writers that a scruple of this sold for- %0a%0a“Nascitur.” In the year 1702 there was found near the Naevian %0aGate, at Eome, a funereal urn, in which there was a skull, calcined bones, %0aand other ashes, enclosed in a cloth of asbestus, of a marvellous length. %0aIt is still preserved in the Vatican. %0a%0aOn the contrary, it is found in the Higher Alps in the vicinity of %0athe Glaciers, in Scotland, and in Siberia, even. %0a%0aSignif 5 'ing “ inextinguishable,” from d, “ not,” and a^tvwiii, “ to %0aextinguish.” See B. xxxvii. c. 54. %0a%0aSee end of this Book. %0a%0aHe evidently alludes to cotton fabrics under this name. See Note 37 %0ato c. 2 of this Book. %0a%0a“ Pausanias, in his Eliaca, goes so far as to say, that hyssus was found %0aonly in Elis, and nowhere else. Judging from the variable temperature %0aof the climate, it is very doubtful. Fee says, if cotton was grown there %0aat all. Arrian, Apollonius, and Philostratus say that the tree which pro¬ %0aduced the hyssm had the leaves of the willow, and the shape of the pop¬ %0alar, characteristics which certainly do not apply to the cotton-tree. %0a%0a%0a138 %0a%0a%0aPliny’s natural history. %0a%0a%0a[Book XIX. %0a%0a%0amerly at four denarii, the same rate, in fact, as gold. The %0adowny nap of linen, and more particularly that taken from %0athe sails of sea-going ships, is very extensively employed for %0amedicinal purposes, and the ashes of it have the same virtues %0aas spodium.®' Among the poppies, too,®* there is a variety which %0aimparts a remarkable degree of whiteness to fabrics made of %0alinen. %0a%0a%0aCHAP. 5.- AT WHAT PERIOD LINEN WAS FIRST DYED. %0a%0aAttempts, too, have even been made to dye linen, and to %0amake it assume the frivolous colours®* of our cloths. This was %0afirst done in the fleet of Alexander the Great, while sailing %0aupon the river Indus ; for, upon one occasion, during a battle %0athat was being fought, his generals and captains distinguished %0atheir vessels by the various tints of their sails, and astounded %0athe people on the shores by giving their many colours to the %0abreeze, as it impelled them on. It was with sails of purple, %0atoo, that Cleopatra accompanied M. Antonius to the battle of %0aActium, and it was by their aid that she took to flight: such %0abeing the distinguishing mark of the royal ship. %0a%0aCHAP. 6.—AT WHAT PERIOD COLOURED AWNINGS WERE FIRST %0aEMPLOYED IN THE THEATRES. %0a%0aIn more recent®* times linens alone have been employed %0afor the purpose of affording shade in our theatres; Q. Catulus %0ahaving been the flrst who applied them to this use, on %0athe occasion of the dedication by him of the Capitol. At a %0alater period, Lentulus Spinther, it is said, was the first to %0aspread awnings of fine linen®® over the theatre, at the celebra¬ %0ation of the Games in honour of Apollo. After this, Caesar, %0a%0aImpure oxide of metals, collected from the chimneys of smelting-houses. %0aFee says that Pliny on this occasion is right. %0a%0a52 In B. XX. c. 79, he speaks of the “ heraclion” poppy, supposed by %0asome of the commentators to be identical with the one mentioned here. %0a%0a53 Vestium insaniam.” %0a%0a51 “ Postea."

At a still later period, and upon the occasion of no %0apublic games, Marcellus, the son of Octavia, sister of Augus¬ %0atus, during his eedileship, and in the eleventh consulship of his %0auncle, on the * * * day before the calends of August, covered %0ain the Forum with awnings, his object being to consult the %0ahealth of those assembled there for the purposes of litigation %0a—a vast change, indeed, from the manners prevalent in the %0adays of Cato the Censor, who expressed a wish that the %0aForum was paved with nothing else but sharp pointed stones. %0a%0aAwnings have been lately extended, too, by the aid of ropes, %0aover the amphitheatres of the Emperor Nero, dyed azure, like %0athe heavens, and bespangled all over with stars. Those which %0aare employed by us to cover the inner court^ of our houses %0aare generally red : one reason for employing them is to protect %0athe moss that grows there from the rays*^ of the sun. In %0aother respects, white fabrics of linen have always held the %0aascendancy in public estimation. Linen, too, was highly %0avalued as early as the Trojan war; for why else should it not %0ahave figured as much in battles as it did in shipwrecks ? Thus %0aHomer,® we find, bears witness that there were but few among %0athe warriors of those days who fought with cuirasses®® on %0amade of linen; while, as for the rigging of the ships, of %0awhich that writer speaks, it is generally supposed by the more %0alearned among the commentators, that it was made of this ma¬ %0aterial ; for the wmrd “ sparta,”® which he employs, means %0anothing more than the produce of a seed. %0a%0aCHAP. 7.

There is %0aa kind of spartum grown in Africa,®* of a stunted nature, and %0aquite useless for all practical purposes. It is found in one %0aportion of the province of Carthage®^ in Nearer Spain, though %0anot in every part of that; but wherever it is produced, the %0amountains, even, are covered all over with it. %0a%0aThis material is employed by the country-people there for %0amaking®® their beds ; with it they kindle their fires also, and %0aprepare their torches; shoes®® also,‘and garments for the shep¬ %0aherds, are made of it. As a food for animals, it is highly in¬ %0ajurious,” with the sole exception of the tender tops of the %0ashoots. When wanted for other uses, it is pulled up by the %0aroots, with considerable labour; the legs of the persons so em¬ %0aployed being protected by boots, and their hands with gloves, %0athe plant being twisted round levers of bone or holm-oak, to %0aget it up with the greater facility. At the present day it is %0agathered in the winter, even; but this work is done with the %0aleast difficulty between the ides of May®® and those of June, %0athat being the period at which it is perfectly ripe. %0a%0aCHAP. 8.-THE MODE OF PKEPARING SPAETTJM. %0a%0aWhen taken up it is made into sheaves, and laid in heaps %0afor a couple of days, while it retains its life and freshness; on %0athe third day the sheaves are opened out and spread in the sun %0a%0aAltliough, as Fee says, this is still the fact, it is a plant which would %0areadily admit of cultivation.

It is then put to soak in sea-water, this being the %0abest of all for the purpose, though fresh water will do in case %0asea- water cannot be procured : this done, it is again dried in %0athe sun, and then moistened afresh. If it is wanted for im¬ %0amediate use, it is put in a tub and steeped in warm water, after %0awhich it is placed in an'tipfighF position to dry : this being %0auniversally admitted to be the most expeditious method of pre¬ %0aparing it. To make it ready for use, it requires to be beaten %0aout. Articles made of it are proof, more particularly, against %0athe action of fresh or sea-water; but on dry land, ropes of hemp %0aare generally preferred. Indeed, we hnd that spar turn receives %0anutriment even from being under water, by way of compen¬ %0asation, as it were, for the thirst it lias had to endure upon its %0anative soil. %0a%0aBy nature it is peculiarly well adapted for repairing, and %0ahowever old the material may he, it unites very well with new. %0aThe person, indeed, who is desirous duly to appreciate this %0amarvellous plant, has only to consider the numerous uses to %0awhich, in all parts of the world, it is applied: from it are %0amade, the rigging of ships, various appliances of mechanism %0aemploj’ed in building, and numerous other articles which supply %0athe wants of daily life. To suffice for all these requirements, %0awe find it growing solely on a tract of ground which lies upon %0athe sea-line of the province of New Carthage, somewhat less %0athan thirty miles in breadth by one hundred in length. ^ I he %0aexpense precludes its being transported to any very considera¬ %0able distance. %0a%0aCHAP. 9. -AT WHAT PERIOD SPAETUM WAS FIRST EMPLOYED. %0a%0aThe Greeks used formerly to employ the rush for making %0aropes; so, at least, we are led to believe, from the name*® given %0aby them to that plant; and at a later period they made them, %0ait is verj' clear, from the leaves of the palm, and the inner %0ahark of the linden-tree. It seems to me very probable, too, %0athat it was from them that the Carthaginians borrowed the %0afirst hint for apply ing spartum to a similar purpose. %0a%0aCHAP. 10. -THE BULB EEIOPHOEUS. %0a%0aTheophrastus^® informs us, that there is a kind of bulb, which %0a%0aThe same word, (tj^oIvoc, signifying both a “ rusli’ and a “ rope. %0a%0aIlist.

It is found, in fact, in no way adhering to %0athe earth, but enclosed within an outer coat; so much so, in¬ %0adeed, that though we cannot exactly pronounce it to be com¬ %0aposed of earth, we must conclude that it is nothing else but a %0acallous’® concretion of the earth. - %0a%0aFee is at a loss to identify this plant, but considers it quite clear %0athat it is not the same with the Eriophorum augustifolium of Linnaeus, a %0acyperaceous plant, of which the characteristics are totally different. Do- %0adonaeus, however, was inclined to consider them identical. %0a%0a’* On the contrary, Theophrastus does mention it, in the Hist. Plant. %0aB. i. c. 8, and speaks of it as having a bark composed of several tunics or %0amembranes. %0a%0aIn B. xiii. c. 13, and B. xv. c. 1. %0a%0a“ Tuber.” The Tuber cibarium of Linnaeus, the black truffle ; and %0aprobably the grey truffle, the Tuber griseum. %0a%0aThis callous secretion of the earth, or corticle, is, as Fee says, a sort %0aof hymcuium, formed of vesicles, which, as they develope themselves, are %0a%0a%0aChap. 12.] %0a%0a%0aMIST, ITON, AND GEEANION. %0a%0a%0a143 %0a%0a%0aTruffles generally grow in dry, sandy soils, and spots that %0aare thickly covered with shrubs; in size they are often larger %0athan a quince, and are found to weigh as much '® as a pound. %0aThere are two kinds of them, the one full of sand, and con¬ %0asequently injurious to the teeth, the other free from sand and %0aall impurities. They are distinguished also by their colour, %0awhich is red or black, and white within ; those of Africa ” %0aare the most esteemed. Whether the truffle grows gradually, %0aor whether this blemish of the earth—for it can be looked upon %0aas nothing else—at once assumes the globular form and magni¬ %0atude which it presents when found; whether, too, it is pos¬ %0asessed of vitality or not, are all of them questions, which, in %0amy opinion, are not easy to be solved. It decays and rots in %0aa manner precisely similar to wood. %0a%0aIt is known to me as a fact, that the following circumstance %0ahappened to Lartius Licinius, a person of praetorian rank, while %0aminister of justice,™ a few years ago, at Carthage in Spain ; %0aupon biting a truffle, he found a denarius inside, which all but %0abroke his fore teeth—an evident proof that the truffle is no¬ %0athing else but an agglomeration of elementary earth. At all %0aevents, it is quite certain that the truffle belongs to those %0avegetable productions which spring up spontaneously, and are %0aincapable of being reproduced from seed.™ %0a%0aCHAP. 12. (3.) —MIST; iton; and geeanion. %0a%0aOf a similar nature, too, is the vegetable production known %0ain the province of Cyrenaica by the name of “ misy,”®° re¬ %0afound to contain diminutive truffles. Pliny is wrong in saying that the %0atruffle forms neither cleft nor protuberance, as the exact contrary is the %0afact. %0a%0a™ Haller speaks of truffles weighing as much as fourteen pounds. %0aValmont de Bomare speaks of a truffle commonly found in Savoy, which %0aattains the weight of a pound. %0a%0aThose of Africa are in general similar to those found in Europe, but %0athere is one peculiar to that country, possibly the same that is mentioned %0ain the following Chapter under the name of ‘‘ misy.” %0a%0a“ Jura reddenti.” %0a%0aIt is really propagated by spores, included in sinuous chambers in %0athe interior; but, notwithstanding the attempts that have been made, it %0ahas never yet been cultivated with any degree of success. In c. 13, Pliny %0aseems to recognize the possibility of its multiplication by germs, where he %0asays that its formation is attributed by some to water. . %0a%0aFee takes this to be the Tuber niveum of Desfentaines, the snow- %0awhite truffle. It is globular and somewhat piriform, grows to the size of a %0awalnut, and sometimes of an orange, and is said to he most delicate eating. %0a%0a%0a144 %0a%0a%0apoint’s natural history. %0a%0a%0a[Book XIX, %0a%0a%0amarkable for the sweetness of its smell and taste, but more %0afleshy than the truffle : the same, too, as to the iton of the %0aThracians, and the geranion of the Greeks. %0a%0aCHAP. 13. —PARTICULARS CONNECTED WITH THE TRUFFLE. %0a%0aThe following peculiarities we find mentioned with reference %0ato the truffle. When there have been showers in autumn, and %0afrequent thunder-storms, truffles ai’e produced, thunder®^ con¬ %0atributing more particularly to their.developement; they do %0anot, however, last beyond a year, and are considered the most %0adelicate eating when gathered in spring. In some places the %0aformation of them is attributed to water; as at Mytilene,®® for %0ainstance, where they are never to be found, it is said, unless %0athe rivers overflow, and bring down the seed from Tiara, that %0abeing the name of a place at which they are produced in the %0agreatest abundance. The finest truffles of Asia are those found %0ain the neighbourhood of Lampsacus and Alopeconnesus; the %0abest in Greece are those of the vicinity of Elis. %0a%0aCHAP. 14. -THE PEZICA. %0a%0aBelonging to the mushroom genus, also, there is a species, %0aknown to the Greeks by the name of “ pezica,”®* which grows %0awithout either root or stalk. %0a%0aCHAP. 15. -LASERPITIUM, LASER, AND MASPETUM. %0a%0aNext to these, laserpitium ®® claims our notice, a very re- %0a%0aThese truffles or morels do not appear to have been identified. %0a%0aJuvenal alludes to this absurd notion, Sat. v. 1. 116. “The long %0a■wished-for thunder will provide a more ample repast.” %0a%0aTheophrastus, as quoted by Athenaeus, B. ii. speaks of this. %0a%0a“Peziza” was a name given by the ancients to a kind of cupuliform %0amushroom; in which, however, we cannot recognize the “ pezica” of %0aPliny. Some writers think that this was the same as the lycoperdon and %0ageastrum of botanists, our puff-ball: while others take it to be the morel, %0athe Morcliella esculenta, Sprengel in the number. Fee is inclined to be %0aof opinion that an edible mushroom is meant, but is quite at a loss to %0aidentify it. %0a%0aPossibly the Ferula asafoetida of I.innaeus; or, according to some, the %0aThapsia silphium of Viviani, Flor. Lib. It was a plant common, accord¬ %0aing to ancient writers, to Syria, Armenia, Media, and Libya ; but it was %0athe produce of this last country, probably, that afforded the juice or gum %0aresin here mentioned as “laser,” and so highly esteemed by the ancients, as %0aforming a component part of their perfumes. Fee is inclined to think %0athat the Laserpitium here spoken of was the Thapsia silphium, and to %0a%0a%0aChap. 15.] LASEEPITIUM, LASER, AND MASPETUM. 145 %0a%0amarkable plant, known to the Greeks by the name of “ sil- %0aphion,” and originally a native of the province of Cyrenaica. %0aThe juice of this plant is called “laser,” and it is greatly in %0avogue for medicinal as well as other purposes, being sold at %0athe same rate as silver. For these many years past, however, %0ait has not been found in Cyrenaica,®® as the farmers of the %0arevenue who hold the lands there on lease, have a notion that %0ait is more profitable to depasture flocks of sheep upon them. %0aWithin the memory of the present generation, a single stalk®’ %0ais all that has ever been found there, and that was sent as a %0acuriosity to the Emperor Nero. If it so happen that one of %0athe flock, while grazing, meets with a growing shoot®® of it, the %0afact is easily ascertained by the following signs; the sheep, after %0aeating of it, immediately falls asleep, while the goat is seized %0awith a fit of sneezing.®® For this long time past, there has %0abeen no other laser imported into this country, but that pro¬ %0aduced in either Persis, Media, or Armenia, where it grows in %0aconsiderable abundance, though much inferior®® to that of Cy¬ %0arenaica ; and even then it is extensively adulterated with gum, %0asacopenium,®* or pounded beans. I ought the less then to %0a%0areject the raore general opinion that it is identical with the Fernla asa- %0afoetida. Pliny has prohahly caused some confusion by blending the de¬ %0ascription of other writers with that given by Theophrastus, each having %0ain view a different plant. Indeed, whatever the Laserpitium or Silphiura %0aof other countries may have been, it is not improbable that the odoriferous %0aplant of Cyrenaica was not identical with the Ferula asafoetidaof Linnaeus. %0aThe foliage of the Thapsia silphium is exactly similar to that of the %0aLaserpitium as depicted on medals of Cyrenaica, still extant. We learn %0afrom Littre, that Dr. Guyon showed, in 1842, to the Academie des %0aSciences, a plant which the Ai-abs of Algeria employ as a purgative, and %0awhich they call bonnefa. It is the Thapsia Garganica of Desfontaines, %0aand is considered by Guyon to he identical with the Silphium of the %0aancients. %0a%0a** See B. xxii. c. 48. In the “ Rudens” of Plautus, the scene of which is %0anear Cyrene, frequent allusion is made to the growth of laserpitium there, %0aand the preparation and export of the resin, as forming the staple article %0aof commerce. %0a%0aScribonius Largus, who lived in the time of Tiberius, speaks of using %0ain a prescription laser of Cyrenaica, “ if it can be met with“ si poterit %0ainveniri.” ®® “ In spem nascentis.” %0a%0aFee remarks that Pliny has not found this absurd story in any of the %0aworks from which he has compiled his account, but that h is entirely his %0aown. %0a%0a®® This was probably the Ferula asafcetida of Linnaeus. %0a%0a** See B.

Valerius and M. %0aHerennius, there was brought to Eome, from C;pren8e, for the %0apublic service, thirty pounds’ weight of laserpitium, and that %0athe Dictator Caesar, at the beginning of the Civil War, took %0afrom out of the public treasury, besides gold and silver, no %0aless than fifteen hundred pounds of laserpitium. %0a%0aWe find it stated by the most trustworthy among the Greek %0awriters,®* that this plant first made its appearance in the vicinity %0aof the gardens of the Hesperides and the Greater Syrtis, im¬ %0amediately after the earth had been soaked on a sudden by a %0ashower as black as pitch. This took place seven j'ears before %0athe foundation of the city of Cyren®, and in the year of Rome %0a143. The virtues of this remarkable fall of rain extended, %0ait is said, over no less than four thousand stadia of the African %0aterritorj'; and upon this soil laserpitium began universally to %0agrow, a plant that is in general wild and stubborn, and which, %0aif attempted to be cultivated, will leave the spot where it has %0abeen sown quite desolate and barren. The roots of it are %0anumerous and thick, the stalk being like that of fennel-giant, %0aand of similar thickness. The leaves of this plant were known %0aas “maspetum,” and bore a considerable resemblance to parsley; %0athe seeds of it were foliaceous, and the plant shed its leaves %0aevery year. They used to feed the cattle there upon it; at %0afirst it purged them, but afterwards they would grow fat, the %0aflesh being improved in flavour in a most surprising degree. %0aAfter the fall of the leaf, the people themselves were in the %0ahabit of eating ®* the stalk, either roasted or boiled : from the %0adrastic effects of this diet the body was purged for the first %0aforty days, all vicious humours being effectually removed.®’ %0aThe juices of this plant were collected two different ways, %0aeither from the root or from the stalk ; in consequence of which %0athese two varieties of the juice were known by the distinguish¬ %0aing names of “rhizias” and “ eaulias,”®® the last being of in¬ %0aferior quality to the other, and very apt to turn putrid.

The juice of the %0aplant was received in vessels, and mixed there with a layer of %0abran ; after which, from time to time it was shaken, till it had %0areached a proper state of maturity; indeed, if this precaution %0awas neglected, it was apt to turn putrid. The signs that it %0ahad come to maturity were its colour, its dryness, and the ab¬ %0asorption of all humidity. %0a%0aThere are some authors, however, who state that the root of %0alaserpitiuro was more than a cubit in length, and that it pre¬ %0asented a tuberosity above the surface of the earth. An incision, %0athey say, was made in this tuberosity, from which a juice would %0aflow, like milk in appearance; above the tuberosity grew a %0astalk, to which they give the name of “ magydaris the %0aleaves that grew upon this stalk were of the colour of gold, and, %0afalling at the rising of the Dog-star, when the south winds %0abegin to prevail, they acted as seed for the purposes of repro¬ %0aduction. It was from these leaves, too, they say, that laser- %0apitium was produced, the root and the stalk attaining their %0afull growth in the space of one year. The same writers also %0astate, that it was the practice to turn up the ground about the %0aplant, and that it had no such effect as purging the cattle that %0awere fed upon it; though one result of using it as food was, %0athat such cattle as were ailing were either cured of their dis¬ %0atempers, or else died immediately upon eating of it, a thing, %0ahowever, that but rarely happened. The first description, %0ahowever, is found to agree more nearly with the silphium %0athat comes from Persis. %0a%0aCHAP. 16. -MAGYDARIS. %0a%0aThere is another*® variety of this plant, known as “ magy¬ %0adaris,”* of a more delicate nature, less active in its effects, and %0adestitute of juice.

(4.) —THE PLEASTTEES OF THE GAEDEX. %0a%0aHaving made mention of these productions, it now remains %0afor us to return to the cultivation of the garden,'^ a subject %0arecommended by its own intrinsic merits to our notice : for we %0afind that in remote antiquity, even, there was nothing looked %0aupon with a greater degree of admiration than the gardens of %0athe Hesperides,*^* those of the kings Adonis and Alci- %0a%0aPliny nor any of the Greek writers mention the Eadicula as being used %0afor dyeing. Some, again, identify it with the Gypsophila struthium of %0aLinnsus, without sufficient warranty, however, as Fee thinks. %0a%0a* The Gypsophila struthium grows in Spain, and possibly, Fee says, %0ain other countries. Linnaeus has “pretended,” he says, that the Spaniards %0astill employ the root and stalk of the Gypsophila for the same purposes as %0athe ancients did the same parts of the Eadicula. He himself, however, %0athough long resident in Spain, had never observed such to be tbe fact. %0a%0aThis description. Fee says, does not correspond with that of the Gyp- %0aBophila struthium, the stalk of which does not at all resemble that of the %0aferulaceous plants, and the leaf is quite different in appearance from that %0aof the olive. %0a%0a“ As Fee observes, by the word “hortus” the Eomans understood %0asolely the “vegetable” or “kitchen-garden;” the pleasure garden being %0agenerally denominated “horti.” See B. v. c. 1. %0a%0aA fabulous king of Phoenicia, probably, whose story was afterwards %0atransferred, with considerable embellishments, to the Grecian mythology. %0aAdonis is supposed to have been identical with the Thammuz of Scripture, %0a%0a%0a150 %0a%0a%0apliny’s natural history. %0a%0a%0a[Book XIX. %0a%0a%0anous/® and the Hanging Gardens, whether they were the work of %0aSemiramis, or whether of Cyrus, king of Assyria, a subject of %0awhich we shall have to speak in another work.** Ihe kings of %0aHome cultivated their gardens with their own hands; indeed, %0ait was from his garden that Tarquinius Superbus sent to his %0ason that cruel and sanguinary message of his. In our laws of %0athe Twelve Tables, we find the word “ villa,” or “ farm,” %0anowhere mentioned; it is the word “ hortus that is always %0aused with that signification, while the term “heredium” we %0afind employed for “ garden.” %0a%0aThere are certain religious impressions, too, that have been %0aattached to this species of property,*® and we find that it is in %0athe garden and the Forum only that statues of satyrs are con¬ %0asecrated, as a protection against the evil effects*’ of spells and %0asorcery; although in Plautus, we find the gardens spoken %0aof as being under the tutelage of Venus.

At last they were relieved from this heavy tax upon their %0awares; and then it was found that there was no tax more %0alucrative, more readily collected, or less obnoxious to the ca¬ %0aprices of chance, than the impost that was levied in exchange %0afor it, in the shape of a property-tax, extended to the poorest %0aclasses: for now the very soil itself is their surety that paid %0athe tax will be, their means are patent to the light of day, and %0athe superficial extent of their possessions, whatever the weather %0amay chance to be, always remains the same. %0a%0aCato,®'' we find, speaks in high praise of garden cabbages:— %0aindeed, it was according to their respective methods of garden %0acultivation that the agriculturists of early times were appreci¬ %0aated, and it was immediately concluded that it was a sign of a %0awoman being a bad and careless manager of her family, when %0athe kitchen-garden—for this was looked upon as the woman’s %0adepartment more particularly—was negligently cultivated; as %0ain such case her only resource was, of course, the shambles or %0athe herb-market. But cabbages were not held in such high %0aesteem in those days as now: indeed, all dishes were held in %0adisrepute which required something else to help them down, %0athe great object being to economize oil as much as possible ; %0aand as to the flesh-market, so much as a wish even to taste its %0awares was visited with censure and reproach. The chief thing %0athat made them so fond of the garden was the fact that its %0aproduce needs no fire and ensures economy in fuel, and that it %0aoffers resources which are always ready and at hand. These %0aarticles of food, which from their peculiar nature we call %0a“vinegar-diets,”®* were found to be easy of digestion, by no %0ameans apt to blunt and overload the senses, and to create but little %0acraving for bread as an accompaniment.

Perhaps, %0atoo, our labours and research may contribute some slight re¬ %0acommendation to this our subject; although, with Virgil,^®we %0aare ready to admit how difldcult it is, by language however %0aelevated, to ennoble a subject that is so humble in itself. %0a%0aCHAP. 20. —THE LAYING OUT OF GARDEN GROUND. %0a%0aThere is no doubt that the proper plan is, to have the gar¬ %0adens adjoining the country-house ; and they- should be watered, %0amore particularly, by a river running in front of it, if possible; %0aor else with water drawn from a well by the aid of a wheel %0aor of pumps, or by swipes.*® The ground should be opened %0ajust as the west winds are beginning to prevail; fourteen %0adays after which it should be got ready for autumn, and then %0abefore the winter solstice it should have another turning up. %0aIt will require eight men to dig a jugerum, manure being %0amixed with the earth to a depth of three feet: the ground, %0atoo, should be divided into plots or beds with raised and %0arounded edges, each of which should have a path dug round it, %0a%0a' by means of which access may be afforded to the gardener and %0aa channel formed for the water needed for irrigation. %0a%0aHe alludes, no doubt, to the words of Virgil, in Georg, iv. 1. 6. %0a%0a“In tenui labor, at tenuis non gloria-” %0a%0athough in that instance the poet is speaking of bees. %0a%0a40 *%3c ToUenonum haustu.” These would be used in the case of well- %0awater ; they are still to be seen occasionally in this country, and are very %0acommon on the continent.

Some of them increase as they lie upon the ground, %0agourds and cucumbers, for instance; the same products will %0agrow also in a hanging position, but they are much heavier %0aeven then than any of the fruits that grow upon trees.

When the cucumber acquires a %0avery considerable volume, it is known to us as the “pepo.”®^ %0aCucumbers when eaten remain on the stomach till the follow¬ %0aing day, and are very difficult®® of digestion; still, for all that, %0ain general they are not considered very unwholesome. By %0anature they have a wonderful hatred to oil, and no less aflfec- %0ation for water, and this after they have been cut from the stem %0aeven.®® If water is within a moderate distance of them, they %0awill creep towards it, while from oil, on the other hand, they %0aM'ill shrink away : if any obstacle, too, should happen to arrest %0atheir progress, or if they are left to hang, they will grow %0acurved and crooked. Of these facts we may be satisfactorily %0aconvinced in a single night even, for if a vessel filled with %0awater is placed at four fingers’ distance from a cucumber, it %0awill be found to have descended to it by the following morn¬ %0aing ; but if the same is done with oil, it will have assumed the %0acurved form of a hook by the next day. If hung in a tube %0awhile in blossom, the cucumber will grow to a most surprising %0a%0a®® Theophrastus and Columella say the same of the cucumber, and %0aPalladius of the melon, but there is no ground, probably, for the belief, lu %0avery recent times, however. Fee says, it was the usage to steep the seeds of the %0amelon in milk. This liquid, in common with any other, would have the %0aeffect of softening the exterior integuments, and thereby facilitating the %0agermination, but no more. %0a%0a®® Still known as the “green” or “gherkin” cucumber, and much used, %0awhen young, for pickling. %0a%0a®« Probably in the sense of a very dark green, for black cucumbers are %0aa thing unheard of. %0a%0a®’ He is evidently speaking of the pompion, or pumpkin, the Cucurbita %0apepo of Linnaeus: quite distinct from the cucumber. %0a%0a®® Cucumbers are not difficult of digestion to the extent that Pliny %0awould have us to believe. %0a%0a®® As Fee says, it is a loss of time to combat such absurd prejudices as %0athese. %0a%0a%0a158 %0a%0a%0aPLIKY’s TTATFEAL niSTORT- %0a%0a%0a[Book XIX. %0a%0a%0alength.®® It is only of late, too, that a cucumber of entirely %0anew shape has been produced in Campania, it having just the %0aform of a quince.** It was quite by accident, I am told, that %0athe first one acquired this shape in growing, and it was from %0athe seed of this that all the others have been reproduced. %0aThe name given to this variety is “ melopepo.” These last do %0anot grow hanging, but assume their round shape as they lie %0aon the ground. A thing that is very remarkable in them, in %0aaddition to their shape, colour, and smell, is the fact that, %0awhen ripe, although they do not hang from the stem, they %0aseparate from it at the stalk. %0a%0aColumella®* has given us a plan of his, by which we may %0ahave cucumbers the whole year round: the largest bramble- %0abush that can be procured is transplanted to a warm, sunny %0aspot, and then cut down, about the time of the vernal equinox, %0ato within a couple of fingers of the ground; a cucumber-seed %0ais then inserted in the pith of the bramble, and the roots are %0awell moulded up with fine earth and manure, to withstand the %0acold. According to the Greeks, there are three kinds of cu¬ %0acumbers, the Laconian, the Scytalic, and the Boeotian,®* the %0aLaconian being the only one among them that is fond ®* of the %0awater. %0a%0aThere are some persons who recommend steeping the seed of %0athe cucumber in the juice of the herb known as the “ culix;”®* %0athe produce, they say, will be sure to grow without seeds. %0a%0aCHAP. 24. —GOTJEDS. %0a%0aGourds resemble the cucumber in nature, at least in their %0amanner of growing; they manifest an equal aversion to the %0awinter, too, while they require constant watering and manure. %0a%0aThis is conformable Avith modem experience. %0a%0aFee says that this is the melon, the Cucumis melo of Linnaeus. %0a%0aB. xi. c. 3.

Some per¬ %0asons, however, think it better to sow gourds after the calends %0aof March,®® and cucumbers after the nones,®® and at the time of %0athe Quinquatria.’® The cucumber and the gourd climb up¬ %0awards in a precisely similar manner, their shoots creeping along %0athe rough surface of the walls, even to the very roof, so great %0ais their fondness for elevated spots. They have not suflScient %0astrength, however, to support themselves without the aid of %0astays. Shooting upwards with the greatest rapidity, they soon %0acover with their light shade the arched roofs of the houses and %0athe trellises on which they are trained. From this circum¬ %0astance it is that we find the gourd classified into two primary %0akinds, the roof-gourd,’^ and the common gourd, which creeps %0aupon the ground. In the first kind, from a stalk of remark¬ %0aable thinness is suspended a fruit of considerable weight and %0avolume, and quite immoveable by the action of the wind. The %0agourd, too, as well as the cucumber, admits of being lengthened %0ato any extent, by the aid of osier tubes more particularly. Just %0aafter the blossom has fallen off, the plant is introduced into %0athese tubes, and as it grows it can be made to assume any form %0athat may be wished, that of a serpent coiled up being the one %0athat is mostly preferred; if left at liberty to grow as it hangs, %0ait has been known before now to attain to no less than nine %0afeet in length. %0a%0aThe cucumber flowers gradually, blossom succeeding blos¬ %0asom ; and it adapts itself perfectly well to a diy soil. It is %0a%0a®® This depth would probably have the effect of retarding, or else utterly %0aimpeding, the growth of the plant. %0a%0aSee c. 44 of this Book.

Bauhiii, the long gourd, and %0aother varieties probably of the calabash gourd, the Cucurbita leucantha of %0aDuchesne. The latter is probably the Cucurbita pepo and its varieties. %0aJ'ee thinks that the name “ cucurbita,” as employed by Pliny, extends ’ %0anot only to the gourd, but the citrul or small pumpkin as well. %0a%0aAs Fee says, he must be speaking of the fruit here, and not tlie %0aplant, which attains a far greater length than nine feet. %0a%0a%0a160 Pliny’s natural history. [Hook XIX. %0a%0acovered with a white down, which increases in quantity as the %0aplant gains in size. %0a%0aThe gourd admits of being applied to more numerous uses %0athan the cucumber even : the stem is used as an article of %0afood” when young, but at a later period it changes its nature, %0aand its qualities become totally different: of late, gourds have %0acome to be used in baths for jugs and pitchers, but for this %0along time past they have been employed as casks” for keeping %0awine. The rind is tender while the fruit is green, but still it %0ais always scraped off when the gourd is used for food. It ad¬ %0amits of being eaten several ways, and forms a light and whole¬ %0asome aliment, and this although it is one of those fruits that %0aare difficult of digestion bj'^ the human stomach, and are apt to %0aswell out those who eat of them. The seeds which lie nearest %0ato the neck of the gourd produce fruit of remarkable ” length, %0aand so do those which lie at the lower extremities, though not %0aat all comparable with the others. Those, on the other hand, %0awhich lie in the middle, produce gourds of a round shape, and %0athose on the sides fruit that are thick and short. The seeds %0aare dried by being placed in the shade, and when wanted for %0asowing, are steeped in water first. The longer and thinner the %0agourd is, the more agreeable it is to the palate, and hence it is %0athat those which have been left to grow hanging are reckoned %0athe most wholesome: these, too, have fewer seeds than the %0aothers, the hardness of which is apt to render the fruit less %0aagreeable for eating. %0a%0aThose which are intended for keeping seed, are usually not cut %0abefore the winter sets in; they are then dried in the smoke, %0aand are extensively employed for preserving” garden seeds, and %0afor making other articles for domestic use. There has been a %0amethod discovered, also, of preserving the gourd for table, and %0athe cucumber as well, till nearly the time when the next year’s %0acrop is ripe; this is done by putting them in brine. We are %0aassured, too, that if put in a hole dug in a place well shaded %0a%0aThe young shoots of the gourd, Fee says, would afford an insipid %0afood, with but little nutriment. %0a%0aThe varieties thus employed. Fee says, must have been the Cucurbita %0alagenaria of Linnaeus, and the Cucurbita latior of Dodonaeus. %0a%0aThis is not the fact. The seed produces fruit similar to that from %0awhich it was taken, and no more. %0a%0aThe trumpet gourd, the Cucurbita longior of Dodonaeus, is still em¬ %0aployed, Fee says, by gardeners fol this purpose. %0a%0a%0aChap. 25.] %0a%0a%0aRAPB : TURXIPS. %0a%0a%0aIGl %0a%0a%0afrom tlie sun, with a laj’er of sand beneath, and dry liay and %0aearth on the top of them, thej'^ may be kept green for a very %0along time.

These wild varieties, however, are only possessed of %0acertain medicinal properties, and for this reason Ave shall defer %0aany further mention of them till we come to the Books appro¬ %0apriated to that subject. %0a%0aCHAP. 25. —RAPE. TURNIPS. %0a%0aThe other plants that are of a cartilaginous nature are con¬ %0acealed, all of them, in the earth. In the number of these is %0athe rape, a subject upon which it would almost appear that %0awe have treated’® at sufficient length already, were it uot that %0awe think it as well to observe, that medical men call those %0awhich are round “ male,”'”® while those which are larger and %0amore elongated, are known to them as “ female ” rape : these %0alast are superior in sweetness, and better for keeping, but by %0asuccessive sowings they are changed into male rape.®® %0a%0aThe same authors, too, have distinguished five different va¬ %0arieties of the turnip :®’ the Corinthian, the Cleonman, the %0aLiothasian, the Boeotian, and the one which they have charac¬ %0aterized as peculiarly the “ green ” turnip. The Corinthian %0aturnip ®® grows to a verj’’ large size, and the root is all but out %0aof the ground; indeed, this is the only kind that, in growing, %0ashoots upwards, and not as the others do, downwards into the %0aground. The Liothasian is known by some persons as the %0aThracian turnip ;®® it is the one that stands extreme cold the %0abest of all. Next to it, the Boeotian kind is the sweetest; it is re¬ %0amarkable, also, for the roundness of its shape and its shortness ; %0a%0a” See B. XX. c. 2. ''® In B. xviii. c. 34. %0a%0aThough borrowed from Theophrastus and the Greek school, this dis¬ %0atinction is absurd and unfounded. %0a%0a'•® It is not the fact that the seed of the round kind, after repeated %0asowings, will produce long roots. Pliny, however, has probably miscopied %0aThcoplirastus, who says. Hist. Plant. B. vii. c. 4, that this transformation %0atakes place when the seed is sown very thick. This assertion, however, %0ais no more founded on truth than that of Pliny. %0a%0a** Also from Theophrastus, B. vii. c. 4 ; though that author is speaking %0aof radishes, pn%3cpnvi8(g, and not turnips. %0a%0aProperly radish.

This plant is remarkable for its %0apungency, which increases in proportion to the thickness of the %0arind: in some cases, too, the surface#of it assumes a ligneous %0anature. Radishes are flatulent®® to a remarkable degree, and %0aare productive of eructations ; hence it is that they are looked %0aupon as an aliment only fit for low-bred people,®* and this %0amore particularly if colcworts are eaten directly after them. %0aIf, on the other hand, they are eaten with green olives, the %0aeructations produced are not so frequent, and less offensive. %0aIn Egypt the radish is held in very high esteem, on account %0aof the abundance of oil®^ that is extracted from the seed. In- %0a%0aRadish. Properly radish. %0a%0aSee B. XX. c. 49. Fee queries whether this radish may not be tlie %0aEaphanus raphanistrum of botanists.

The variety %0aOleifera of the Brassica napus is also greatly cultivated in Egypt. Fee %0asuggests that Pliny may possibly confound these two plants under the one %0aname of “ raphanus.” It is worthy of remark, too, that the Colza oil, so %0amuch used in France and Belgium for burning in lamps, is expressed from %0athe seed of the Brassica olcracea, a species of cabbage. %0a%0a%0aCbap. 26.] %0a%0a%0aEADISHES. %0a%0a%0a163 %0a%0a%0adeed, the people of that country sow this plant in preference %0ato any other, whenever they can get the opportunity, the profits %0aderived from it being larger than those obtained from the culti¬ %0avation of corn, and the imposts levied upon it considerably less : %0athere is no grain known that yields a larger quantity of oil. %0a%0aThe Greeks have distinguished the radish^ into three dif¬ %0aferent kinds, according to the characteristic features of the %0aleaves, there being the crisped leaf, the smooth leaf, and the %0awild radish, the leaf of which is smooth, but shorter than that %0aof the others ; it is round also, grows in great abundance, and %0aspreads like a shrub. The taste of this last variety is acrid, %0aand it acts medicinally as a strong purgative. In the first kind, %0aagain, there are certain differences, determined by the seed, for %0ain some varieties the seed is of an inferior quality, and in others %0aremarkably small: these defects, however, are only found to %0aexist in the kind that has the crisped leaf. %0a%0aOur own people, again, have found other varieties of the %0aradish : there is the Algidan radish, long and transparent, so %0acalled from the place of its growth: another, similar to the %0arape in form, is known as the Syrian radish; it is pretty %0anearly the mildest and the most tender of them all, and is well %0aable to bear the winter. The very best of all, however, is the %0aone that has been brought fi’om Syria, very recently it would %0aseem, as we do not find it mentioned by any of our writers: %0ait lasts the whole of the winter through. In addition to these %0akinds, there is another, a wild variety, known by the Greeks as %0a“agrion,”®® and to the people of Pontus as “ armon,” while %0aothers, again, call it “ leuce,“® and our people “ armoracia %0ait has more leaves, however, than root. %0a%0aIn testing the quality of the radish, it is the stem more par- %0a%0aThe Eaphanus sativus of Linnaeus. This passage, however, down to %0a“ crisped leah” properly applies to the cabbage, and not the radish, Pliny %0ahaving copied the Greek, and taken the word 'pd^avoQ, properly “ cabbage,” %0ato mean “ radishwliich in the later Greek writers it sometimes does, %0athough not in this instance. %0a%0aMount Algidus was near Tusculum, fifteen miles from Eome. Its %0acoldness contributed greatly to the goodness of its radishes. %0a%0a95 Or “ wild.” Fee suggests that this is the Eaphanus msticanus of %0aLobellius, the Cochlearia Armoracia of Linnaeus, the wild radish, or horse¬ %0aradish. %0a%0aOr “white.” From the extreme whiteness of the roots. %0a%0aProbably meaning, “ radish of Armorica.” %0a%0aM 2 %0a%0a%0a164 %0a%0a%0aPLTNT'S NA-TUIIAL UISTORT. %0a%0a%0a[Book XIX. %0a%0a%0aticulaily, that is looked at; in those which are acrid to the %0ataste, for instance, it is rounder and thicker than in the others, %0aand gro%3coved with long channels, while the leaves are more un¬ %0asightly to the eye, being angular and covered with prickles. %0a%0aThe radish requires to he sown in a loose, humid soil, has a %0agreat aversion to manure, and is content with a dressing solely %0aof chaff: so fond is it of the cold, that in Germany it is known %0ato grow as large as an infant in size.®® For the spring crop, %0ait is sown immediately after the ides of February ;®® and then %0aagain about the time of the Vulcanalia,' this last crop being %0alooked upon as the best: many persons, however, sow radishes %0ain March, April, and September. When the plant begins to %0agrow to any size, it is considered a good plan to cover up the %0aleaves successively, and to earth up the root as well; for the %0apart of it which appears above ground is apt to become hard %0aand pithy. Aristomachus recommends the leaves to be taken %0aoff in winter, and the roots to he well moulded up, to prevent %0athe water from accumulating about them; and he says, that %0aby using these precautions, they will be all the finer in summer. %0aBorne authors have mentioned a plan of making a hole with a %0adibble, and covering it at the bottom wdth a layer of chaff, six %0afingers in depth; upon this layer the seed is put, and then %0acovered over with manure and earth ; the result of which is, %0aaccording to their statement, that radishes are obtained full as %0alarge as the hole so made. It is salt, however, that conduces %0amore particularly to their nutriment, and hence it is that they are %0aoften watered with brine ; in Egypt, too, the growers sprinkle %0anitre ’ over them, the roots being remarkable for their mildness %0aThe salt, too, has the similar effect of removing all their pun- %0agency, and when thus treated, they become very similar in %0atheir qualities to radishes that have been boiled: for when %0aboiled they become sweet and mild, and eat, in fact, just like %0aturnips. %0a%0aFee suggests that he is here speaking of the heet-root, in reality a %0anative of the north of Europe. %0a%0aThirteenth of February. %0a%0a* The festival of Vulcan, beginning on the twenty-third of August, and %0alasting eight days. %0a%0a- A natural production, the carbonate of sodium of the chemists, kno\ni %0afrom time immemorial by the name of “natron.” See B. xxx. c. 46; %0afrom which passage it would appear that it w'as generally employed for %0awatering the leguminous plants. %0a%0a%0aChap. 27.] %0a%0a%0aPARSNIPS. %0a%0a%0a165 %0a%0a%0aMedical men recommend raw radishes to be eaten fasting, %0awith salt, for the purpose ® of collecting the crude humours of %0athe viscera ; and in this way they prepare them for the action %0aof emetics. It is said, too, that the juices of this plant are %0aabsolutely necessary for the cure of certain diseases of the %0adiaphragm; for it has been found by experiment, in Egypt, %0athat the phthiriasis ^ which attaches itself to the internal parts %0aof the heart, cannot possiblj'^ be eradicated by any other remedj’-, %0athe kings of that country having ordered the bodies of the %0adead to be opened and examined, for the purpose of enquiring %0ainto certain diseases. %0a%0aSuch, too, is the frivolity of the Greeks, that, in the temple %0aof Apollo at Delphi, it is said, the radish is so greatly pre¬ %0aferred to aU other articles of diet, as to be represented there in %0agold, the beet in silver, and the rape in lead.—A ou might be %0avery sure that Manius Curius was not a native of that country, %0athe general whom, as we find stated in our Annals, the am¬ %0abassadors of the Samnites found busy roasting rape at the fire, %0awhen they came to offer him the gold which he so indignantly %0arefused. Moschion, too, a Greek author, has written a volume %0aon the subject of the radish. These vegetables are considered %0aa very useful article of food during the winter, but they are at %0aall times very injurious to the teeth, as they are apt to wear %0athem away; at ^1 events, they give a polish to ivory. There %0ais a great antipathy between the radish ® and the vine ; which %0alast win shrink from the radish, if sown in its vicinity. %0a%0aCHAP. 27. —PARSNIPS. %0a%0aThe other kinds which have been classified by us among the %0acartilaginous plants, are of a more ligneous nature; and it is %0aa singular thing, that they have, all of them, a strong flavour. %0aAmong these, there is one kind of wild parsnip which grows %0a%0a* Dioscorides recommends these puerilities with the cabbage, and not %0athe radish ; though Celsus gives similar instructions with reference to the %0aradish. %0a%0a* It was a general belief with the ancients that the phthiriasis, or mor¬ %0abus pediculosus, has its seat in the heart. It was supposed also that the %0ajuice of the radish was able, by reason of its supposed subtlety, to penetrate %0athe coats of that organ. %0a%0a® Tliis is said hy other ancient authors, in reference to the cabbage and %0athe vine.

The parsnip begins %0ato be fit for eating at the end of a year, but it is still better at %0athe end of two: it is reckoned more agreeable eating in autumn, %0aand more particularly if cooked in the saucepan ; even then, %0ahowever, it preserves its strong pungent flavour, which it is %0afound quite impossible to get rid of. %0a%0aThe hibiscum® differs from the parsnip in being more slender: %0ait is rejected as a food, but is found useful for its medicinal %0aproperties. There is a fourth kind,® also, which bears a similar %0adegree of resemblance to the parsnip; by our people it is %0acalled the “ gallica,” while the Greeks, who have distinguished %0a, four varieties of it, give it the name of “ daucus.” We shall %0ahave further occasion’® to mention it among the medicinal %0aplants. %0a%0a%0aCHAP. 28. -THE SKIREET. %0a%0aThe skirret,” too, has had its reputation established by the %0aEmperor Tiberius, who demanded a supply of it every year %0afrom Germany.

There %0aare several methods employed for modifying*^ its natural %0aacridity and rendering it agreeable to the palate : thus, for in¬ %0astance, Avhen dried it is reduced to a fine flour, and then mixed %0awith some sweet liquid or other, or else it is boiled in vinegar %0aand water, or kept in soak in it; it is also steeped in various %0aother ways, and then mixed with boiled grape-juice, or else %0aincorporated with honey or raisins, or dates with plenty of %0ameat on them. Other persons, again, have a method of pre¬ %0aparing it with quinces, or else sorbs or plums, while sometimes %0athe flav'our is varied by the addition of pepper or thj^me. %0a%0aThis plant is particularly good for weakness of the stomach, %0aand it has acquired a high reputation from the circumstance %0athat Julia Augusta used to eat it daily. The seed of it is %0aquite useless, as the plant is reproduced, like the reed, from %0aeyes extracted from the root. This vegetable, as well as the %0askirret and the parsnip, is sown both in spring and autumn, a %0aconsiderable distance being left between the plants ; indeed, for %0aelecampane, a space of no less than three feet is required, as %0a%0a'3 The Inula Ilelenium of Linnaeus.

Among these bulbs, the squill,’" %0awe find, occupies the very highest rank, although by nature it %0ais medicinal, and is employed for imparting an additional sharp¬ %0aness to vinegar indeed, there is no bulb known that grows %0ato a larger size than this, or is possessed of a greater degree of %0apungency. There are two varieties of it employed in medi¬ %0acine, the male squill, which has white leaves, and the female %0asquill, with black®® ones. There is a third kind also, which is %0agood to eat, and is known as the Epimenidian®^ squill; the leaf %0ais narrow'^er than in the other kinds, and not so rough. All %0athe squills have numerous seeds, but they come up much more %0aquickly if propagated from the oflsets that grow on the sides. %0aTo make them attain a still greater size, the large leaves that %0agrow around them are turned down and covered over with %0aearth; by which method all the juices are carried to the %0aheads. Squills grow spontaneously and in vast numbers in %0athe Ilaleares and the island of Ebusus, and in the Spanish pro¬ %0avinces.®® The philosopher Pythagoras has written a whole vo¬ %0alume on the merits of this plant, setting forth its various mc- %0a%0aThe same account nearly is given in Columella, De Ee Rust.

GARDEN PLANTS WHICH LOSE THEIR LEAVES. %0a%0aNearly alP the garden plants have a single^^ root only, %0aradishes, beet, parsley, and mallows, for example; it is lapa- %0athum, however, that has the longest root of them all, it attain¬ %0aing the length of three cubits even. The root of the wild %0akind is smaller and of a humid nature, and when up it will %0akeep alive for a considerable period. In some of these plants, %0ahowever, the roots are fibrous, as we find the case in parsley %0aand mallows, for instance; in others, again, they are of a %0aligneous nature, as in ocimum, for example ; and in others they %0aare fleshy, as in beet, and in saffron even more so. In some, %0aagain, the root is composed of rind and flesh, as in the radish %0aand the rape ; while in others it is jointed, as in hay grass.“ %0aThose plants which have not a straight root throw out imme¬ %0adiately a great number of hairy fibres, orage^® and blite,^® for %0ainstance: squills again, bulbs, onions, and garlic never have %0aany but a vertical root.

Taking %0athe hint from this fact, it is recommended to strip the other %0akinds of their leaves, to make them bulb all the better, instead %0aof running to seed. %0a%0aThe Ascalonian onion is of a peculiar nature, being barren %0ain some measure in the root; hence it is that the Greeks have %0arecommended it to be reproduced from seed, and not from roots: %0athe transplanting, too, they say, should be done later in the %0aspring, at the time the plant germinates, the result being that %0ait bulbs with all the greater rapidity, and hastens, as it were, %0ato make up for lost time ; great dispatch, however, is requisite %0ain taking it up, for when ripe it rots with the greatest rapi¬ %0adity. If propagated from roots, it throws out a long stalk, %0aruns rapidly to seed, and dies. %0a%0aThere are considerable differences, too, in the colour of the %0aonion ; the whitest of all are those grown at Issue and Sardes. %0aThe onions, too, of Crete are held in high esteem, but there %0ais some doubt whether they are not the same as the Ascalonian %0avariety; for when grown from seed they produce a fine bulb, %0abut when planted they throw out a long stalk and run to seed; %0ain fact, they differ from the Ascalonian kind only in the sweet¬ %0aness of their flavour. %0a%0aAmong us there are two principal varieties known of the %0aonion ; the scallion, employed for seasonings, is one, known to %0athe Greeks by the name of “ gethyon,” and by us as the “pal- %0alacanait is sown in March, April, and Maj^ The other %0akind is the bulbed or headed®® onion; it is sown just after the %0aautumnal equinox, or else after the west winds have begun to %0aprevail. The varieties of this last kind, ranged according to %0atheir relative degrees of pungency, are the African onion, the %0aGallic, the Tusculan, the Ascalonian, and the Amitemian: the %0aroundest in shape are the best. The red onion, too, is more %0apungent than the white, the stored than the fresh, the raw %0athan the cooked, and the dried than the preserved. The onion %0aof Amiternum is cultivated in cold, humid localities, and is %0athe only one that is reproduced from heads,®® like garlic, the %0aother kinds being grown from seed. This last kind yields no %0a%0a“Capitata.” %0a%0aFor this reason, Fee is inclined to resard it as a variety either of %0agarlic, Allium sativum, or of the chalotte, Allium Ascalonicum of Liuuie is. %0a%0a%0aChap. 33.] %0a%0a%0aTKE LEEK. %0a%0a%0a173 %0a%0a%0aseed in the ensuing summer, but a bulb only, which dries and %0akeeps; but in the summer after, the contrary is the case, for %0aseed is produced, while the bulb very quickly spoils. Hence %0ait is that every year there are two separate sowings, one of %0aseed for the reproduction of bulbs, and one of bulbs for the %0agrowth of seed; these onions keep best in chaff. The scallion %0ahas hardly any bulb at aU, but a long neck only—hence it is %0anothing but leaf, and is often cut down, like the leek ; for this %0areason, too, like the leek, it is grown from seed, and not from %0aplants. %0a%0aIn addition to these particulars, it is recommended that the %0aground intended for sowing onions should be turned up three %0atimes, care being taken to remove all roots and weeds; ten %0apounds of seed is the proper proportion for a jugerum. Savory ’ %0atoo, they say, should be mixed with them, the onions being all %0athe finer for it; the ground, too, should be stubbed and hoed %0afour times at least, if not oftener. In Italy, the Ascalonian %0aonion is sown in the month of February. The seed of the %0aonion is gathered when it begins to turn black, and before it %0abecomes dry and shrivelled. %0a%0aCHAP. 33. -THE LEEK. %0a%0aWhile upon this subject, it will be as well, too, to speak of %0athe leek,®* on account of the afSnity which it bears to the plants %0ajust mentioned, and more particularly because cut-leek has %0arecently acquired considerable celebrity from the use made of %0ait by the Emperor Hero. That prince, to improve his voice,®" %0aused to eat leeks and oil every month, upon stated days, ab- %0astaihing from every other kind of food, and not touching so %0amuch as a morsel of bread even. Leeks are reproduced from %0aseed, sown just after the autumnal equinox; if they are in¬ %0atended for cutting,®® the seed is sown thicker than otherwise. %0aThe leeks in the same bed are cut repeatedly, till it is quite ex¬ %0ahausted, and they are alw'ays kept well manured. If they are %0a%0a®' The Allium porrum of Linnaeus. %0a%0a®® This prejudice in favour of the leek, as Fee remarks, still exists. It %0ais doubtful, however, whether its mucilage has any beneficial effect upon %0athe voice. See B. xx. c. 21. %0a%0a®® Fee says, that it is a practice with many gardeners, more harmful %0athan beneficial, to cut the leaves of the leek as it grows, their object being %0ato increase the size of the stalk. %0a%0a%0a174 %0a%0a%0apliny’s natural history. %0a%0a%0a[Book XIX. %0a%0a%0awanted to bulb before being cut, when they have grown to %0asome size they are transplanted to another bed, the extremities %0aof the leaves being snipped off without touching the white part, %0aand the heads stripped of the outer coats. The ancients were %0ain the habit of placing a stone or potsherd upon the leek, to %0amake the head grow all the larger, and the same with the %0abulbs as well; but at the present day it is the usual practice %0ato move the fibrous roots gently with the weeding-hook, so that %0aby being bent they may nourish the plant, and not withdraw %0athe juices from it. %0a%0aIt is a remarkable fact, that, though the leek stands in need %0aof manure and a rich soil, it has a particular aversion to water; %0aand yet its nature depends very much upon the natural proper¬ %0aties of the soil. The most esteemed leeks are those grown in %0aEgypt, and next to them those of Ostia and Aricia.®^ Of the %0aleek for cutting, there are two varieties: that with grass- %0agreen leaves and incisions distinctly traced on them, and the %0aleek vith paler and rounder leaves, the incisions being more %0alightly marked. There is a story told, that Mela,“ a member %0aof the Equestrian order, being accused of mal-administration %0aby order of the Emperor Tiberius, swallowed in his despair %0aleek-juice to the amount of three denarii in weight of silver, %0aand expired upon the spot without the slightest symptom of %0apain. It is said, however, that a larger dose than this is pro¬ %0aductive of no injurious effects whatever.®^ %0a%0aCHAP. 34. —garlic. %0a%0aGarlic is generally supposed, in the country more particu¬ %0alarly, to be a good specific for numerous maladies. The ex- %0a%0aMartial, B. xiii. Epig. 19, mentions the leeks of Aricia. %0a%0aFee thinks that this may be the wild leek, which is commonly found %0aas a weed in Spain. %0a%0aM.

The flavour of it is pun¬ %0agent, and the more numerous the cloves the more pungent it %0ais. Like the onion, it imparts an offensive smell to the breath ; %0abut this is not the case when it is cooked. The various species %0aof garlic are distinguished by the periods at which they ripen: %0athe early kind becomes fit for use in sixty days. Another dis¬ %0atinction, too, is formed by the relative size of the heads. Ulpi- %0acum,'® also, generally known to the Greeks as Cyprian garlic,” %0abelongs to this class; by some persons it is called “ antisco- %0arodon,” and in Africa more particularly it holds a high rank %0aamong the dishes of the rural population ; it is of a larger size %0athan ordinary garlic. When beaten up with oil and vinegar, %0ait is quite surprising what a quantity of creaming foam is pro¬ %0aduced. %0a%0aThere are some persons who recommend that neither ulpicum %0anor garlic should be sown on level ground, but say that they %0ashould be planted in little mounds trenched up, at a distance of %0athree feet apart. Between each clove, they say, there should %0abe a distance of four fingers left, and as soon as ever three %0aleaves are visible, the heads should be hoed; the oftener they %0aare hoed, the larger the size they will attain. When they %0abegin to ripen, the stalks are bent downwards, and covered %0aover with earth, a precaution which effectually prevents them %0afrom running to leaf. In cold soils, it is considered better to %0aplant them in spring than in autumn. %0a%0aFor the purpose of depriving all these plants of their strong %0asmell, it is recommended to set them when the moon is below %0athe horizon, and to take them up Avhen she is in conjunction. %0aIndependently of these precautions, we find Menander, one %0aof the Greek writers, recommending those who haA'e been %0aouting garlic to eat immediately afterwards a root of beet %0a%0aserpents; and though persons who had just eaten of it were not allowed to %0aenter the Temple of the Mother of tlie Gods, it was prescribed to those %0awho wished to be purified and ab.solved from crimes. It is still held in %0aconsiderable esteem in the south of Europe, where, by the lower classes, %0agreat medicinal virtues are ascribed to it. %0a%0aTheophrastus says, Hist. Plant. B. vii. c. 4, that this is the largest %0aof aU the varieties of garlic. %0a%0a%0a176 %0a%0a%0apliut’s natural ihstout. %0a%0a%0a[Book XIX. %0a%0a%0aroasted on hot coals ; if this is done, he says, the strong smell %0aof the garlic will be elfectually neutralized. Some persons are of %0aopinion, that the proper period for planting garlic and ulpicum %0ais between the festival of the Compitalia’^ and that of the %0aSaturnalia.'^ Garlic, too, can be grown from seed, but it is %0avery slow, in such case, in coming to maturity ; for in the first %0ayear, the head attains the size only of that of a leek, in the %0asecond, it separates into cloves, and only in the third it arrives %0aat maturity ; there are some, however, who think that garlic %0agrown this way is the best. Garlic should never be allowed %0ato run to seed, but the stalk should be twisted, to promote its %0agrowth, and to make the head attain a larger size. %0a%0aIf garlic or onions are wanted to keep some time, the heads %0ashould be dipped in salt water, made luke-warm; by doing %0athis, they will be all the better for keeping, though quite %0aworthless for reproduction. Some persons content themselves %0awith hanging them over burning coals, and are of opinion that %0athis is quite sufficient to prevent them from sprouting : for it %0ais a well-known fact, that both garlic and onions sprout when %0aout of the ground, and that after throwing out their thin shoots %0athey shrivel away to nothing. Some persons are of opinion, %0atoo, that the best way of keeping garlic is by storing it in chaff. %0aThere is a kindof garlic that grows spontaneously in tho %0afields, and is known by the name of “ alum.” To preserve %0athe seeds that are sown there from the remorseless ravages of %0athe birds, tfiis plant is scattered over the ground, being first %0aboiled, to prevent it from shooting. As soon as ever they have %0aeaten of it, the birds become so stupefied as to be taken with %0athe hand even,''"* and if they remain but a few moments onlj %0aon the spot, they fall fast asleep.

(?.)—THE NUMBER OF DATS REQUIRED FOR THE RE¬ %0aSPECTIVE PLANTS TO MAKE THEIR APPEARANCE ABOVE GROUND. %0a%0aAmong the garden’® plants which make their appearance %0amost speedily above ground, are ocimum, blite, the turnip, and %0arocket; for they appear above the surface the third day after %0athey are sown. Anise, again, comes up on the fourth day, the %0alettuce on the fifth, the radish on the sixth, the cucumber and %0athe gourd on the seventh—the cucumber rather the first of the %0atwo—cresses and mustard on the fifth, beet on the sixth day %0ain summer and the tenth in winter, orage on the eighth, onions %0aon the nineteenth or twentieth, and scallions on the tenth %0aor twelfth. Coriander, again, is more stubborn in its growth, %0acunila and wild marjoram do not appear till after the thirtieth %0aday, and parsley comes up with the greatest difficulty of all, %0afor at the very earliest it is forty days before it shows itself, %0aand in most instances as much as fifty. %0a%0aThe age,” too, of the seed is of some importance in this re¬ %0aspect ; for fresh seed comes up more rapidly in the case of the %0aleek, the scallion, the cucumber, and the gourd, while in that %0aof parsley, beet, cardamum, cunila, wild marjoram, and co¬ %0ariander, seed that has been kept for some time is the best. %0a%0aThere is one remarkable circumstance in connection with %0athe seed of beet; it does not all germinate in the first year, but %0asome of it in the second, and some in the third even ; hence %0ait is that a considerable quantity of seed produces only a very %0amoderate crop. Some plants produce only in the year in which %0athey are set, and some, again, for successive years, parsley, %0aleelis, and scallions’® for instance ; indeed, these plants, when %0aonce sown, retain their fertility, and produce for many years. %0a%0aThe whole nearly of this Chapter is borrowed from Theophrastus, %0aHist.

There are differences, %0aalso, in the colour of seeds, which is either black or white; %0awhile some seeds are woody and hard, in radishes, mustard, %0aand rape, the seeds are enclosed in pods. In parsley, corian- %0ader, anise, fennel, and cummin, the seed has no covering at all, %0awhile in blite, beet, orage, and ocimum, it has an outer coat, %0aand in the lettuce it is covered with a fine down. There is no %0aseed more prolific than that of ocimum it is generally re¬ %0acommended®^ to sow it with the utterance of curses and im¬ %0aprecations, the result being that it grows all the better for it; %0athe earth, too, is rammed down when it is sown, and prayers %0aoffered that the seed may never come up. The seeds which are %0aenveloped in an outer coat, are dried with considerable diffi¬ %0aculty, that of ocimum more particularly; hence it is that all %0athese seeds are dried artificially, their fruitfulness being greatly %0apromoted thereby. %0a%0aPlants in general come up better when the seed is sown in %0aheaps than when it is scattered broad-cast: leeks, in fact, and %0aparsley are generally grown by sowing the seed in little bags %0ain the case of parsley, too, a hole is made with the dibble, and a %0alayer of manure inserted. %0a%0aAll garden plants grow either from seed or from slips, and %0asome from both seed and suckers, such as rue, wild marjoram, %0aand ocimum,®® for example—this last being usually cut when %0ait is a palm in height. Some kinds, again, are reproduced %0afrom both seed and root, as in the case of onions, garlic, and %0abulbs, and those other plants of which, though annuals them¬ %0aselves, the roots retain their vitality. In those plants which %0agrow from the root, it lives for a considerable time, and throws %0aout offsets, as in bulbs, scallions, and squills for example.— %0a%0aFee says that basil, the Ocimum basilicum of Linnaeus, is not meant %0ahere, nor yet the leguminous plant that was known to the Romans by that %0aname. %0a%0aA singular superstition truly!

THE LETTUCE ; ITS DIFFERENT VARIETIES. %0a%0aThe Greeks have distinguished three varieties of the lettuce %0athe first with a stalk so large, that small garden gates,®’ it is %0asaid, have been made of it: the leaf of this lettuce is some- %0a■what larger than that of the herbaceous, or green lettuce, but %0aextremely narrow, the nutriment seeming to be expended on %0athe other parts of the plant. The second kind is that with a %0arounded®® stalk; and the third is the low, squat lettuce,®*gene¬ %0arally known as the Laconian lettuce. %0a%0a“ thinly covered with leaves,” and not iiov6(pvW‘'v, “ having a single %0aleaf.” Palladius (iw translates it, “ molli folio,” “with a soft %0a%0aleaf;” hut, though Fte commends this version, it is not correct. %0a%0aOr “horse-parsley.” Hardouin takes this to he Macedonian parsley, %0athe Buhon Macedonicum of Linnaeus. Fee, following C. Bauhin and %0aSprengel, is inclined to identify it with Macerona, the Smyrnium olusa- %0atrum of Linnaeus. %0a%0aOr “mountain-parsley.” Probably the Athamanta oreoselinum of %0a' Linnaeus. Some commentators, however, take it to be the Laserpitium %0aformosum of Wilidenow. Sprengel identifies it with the Selinum oreose¬ %0alinum of Linnaeus. %0a%0aThe Apium petroselinum, probably, of Linnaeus. %0a%0aThe Lactuca sativa of Linnaeus, This account of the Greek varieties %0ais from Theophrastus, Hist.

The Goss, or Eoman, lettuce, ris %0aFee remarks, is the largest of all, and that never exceeds fifteen to twenty %0ainches im height, leaves, stalk and all. %0a%0a®® This would seem not to be a distinct variety, as the rounded stalk is %0aa cnaracteristic of them all. %0a%0a“ Sessile.” A cabbage-lettuce, probably ; though Hardouin dissents %0afrom that opinion. %0a%0a%0aChap. 38.] THE NATUEE OF OAEDEIT PLANTS. %0a%0a%0a181 %0a%0a%0aSome persons ‘ have made distinctions in reference to their %0arespective colours, and the times for sowing them: the black %0alettuce is sown in the month of January, the white in March, %0aand the red in April; and they are fit for transplanting, all of %0athem, at the end of a couple of months. Those, again, who %0ahave pursued these enquiries even further than this, have dis¬ %0atinguished a still greater number of varieties of them—the %0apurple, the crisped, the Cappadocian,® and the Greek lettuce, %0athis last having a longer leaf than the rest, and a broad stalk : %0ain addition to which, there is one with a long, narrow leaf, %0avery similar to endive in appearance. The most inferior kind, %0ahowever, of all, is the one to w^hich the Greeks, censuring it %0afor its bitterness, have given the name of “ picris.”^ There is %0astill another variety, a kind of white lettuce, called “ meconis,”^ %0aa name which it derives from the abundance of milk, of a %0anarcotic quality, which it produces; though, in fact, it is gene¬ %0arally thought that they are all of them of a soporific tendency. %0aIn former times, this last was the only kind of lettuce that %0awas held in any esteem® in Italy, the name “ lactuca ” having %0abeen given it on account of the milk ® which it contains. %0a%0aThe purple kind, with a very large root, is generally known %0aas the Csecilian ’’ lettuce; while the round one, with an ex¬ %0atremely diminutive root and broad leaves, is known to some %0apersons as the “astytis,”® and to others as the “ eunychion,” %0ait having the effect, in a remarkable degree, of quenching the %0aamorous propensities. Indeed, they are, all of them, possessed %0aof cooling and refreshing properties, for which reason it is, %0athat they are so highly esteemed in summer; they have the %0aeffect, also, of removing from the stomach distaste for food, %0aand of promoting the appetite. At all events, we find it %0astated, that the late Emperor Augustus, when ill, was saved %0a%0a^ Columella more particularly. There are still varieties known respec¬ %0atively as the black, brown, white, purple, red, and blood-red lettuce. %0a%0a2 Martial, 13. v. Epig. 79, gives to this lettuce the epithet of “ vile.” %0a%0a® It has been suggested that this may have been wild endive, the Cicho- %0areum intubus of botanists. %0a%0a* Or “poppy-lettuce.” See B. xx. c. 26.

The rule is, however, to sow %0athem just after the winter solstice, and to transplant Avhen the %0awest winds begin to prevail, or else to sow at this latter period, %0aand to plant out at tlie vernal equinox. The white lettuce is %0athe best adapted for standing the rigours of the winter. %0a%0aAll the garden plants are fond of moisture ; lettuces thrive, %0amore particularly, when well manured, and endive even more %0aso. Indeed, it is found an excellent plan to plant them out with %0athe roots covered up in manure, and to keep up the supply, the %0aearth being cleared away for that purpose. Some, again, have %0aanother method of increasing their size ; they cut them^^ down %0awhen they have reached half a foot in height, and cover them %0awith fresh swine’s dung. It is the general opinion that those %0alettuces only will admit of being blanched which are produced %0afrom white seed; and even then, as soon as they begin to %0agrow, sand from the sea-shore should be spread over them, %0acare being taken to tie the leaves as soon as ever they begin %0ato come to any size. %0a%0aCHAP. 40.— BEET : FOTJK VAEIETIES OF IT. %0a%0aBeet“ is the smoothest of all the garden plants. The Greeks %0adistinguish two kinds of beet, according to the colour, the %0ablack and the white. The last, which is the kind generally %0apreferred, has but very little seed, and is generally known as %0athe Sicilian^^ beet; just as it is the white lettuce that is held %0ain the highest degree of esteem. Our people, also, distinguish %0atwo varieties of beet, the spring and the autumn kinds, so %0a%0aThe usual times for sowing the lettuce are before winter and after %0aFebruary. %0a%0a^ An excess of manure is injurious to the lettuce. %0a%0a•* As already stated in a previous Note (p. 179), lettuces when cut down %0awill not gi-ow again, with the exception of a few worthless lateral branches. %0a%0aFrom Theophrastus, Hist. Plant. B. vii. c. 4. %0a%0a“ Not the Beta sicla of modern botany. Fee thinks. The black beet %0aof the ancients would be one of the dark purple kinds. %0a%0a%0a184 %0a%0a%0aplint’s natural history. %0a%0a%0a[Book XIX. %0a%0a%0acalled from the periods of sowing; although sometimes we %0afind beet sown in June even. This is a plant, too, that is %0asometimes transplanted; and it thrives all the better, like the %0alettuce, if the roots are well covered with manure, in a moist %0asoil. Beet is mostly eaten'*^ with lentils and beans ; it is pre¬ %0apared also in the same way as cabbage, with mustard more %0aparticularly, the pungency of which relieves its insipidity. %0aMedical men are of opinion that beet is a more unwholesome^ %0avegetable than cabbage; hence it is that I never remember %0aseeing it served at table. Indeed, there are some persons who %0ascruple to taste it even, from a conviction that it is a food %0asuitable only for persons of a robust constitution. %0a%0aBeet is a vegetable with twofold characteristics, partaking %0aof the nature of the cabbage in its leaves and resembling a %0abulb in the root; that which grows to the greatest breadth %0abeing the most highly esteemed. This plant, like the lettuce, %0ais made to grow to head by putting a light weight upon it the %0amoment it begins to assume its proper colour. Indeed, there %0ais no garden plant that grows to a larger head than this, as it %0asometimes spreads to a couple of feet in breadth, the nature of %0athe soil contributing in a very considerable degree to its size: %0athose found in the territory of Circeii attain the largest size. %0aSome persons'® think that the best time for sowing beet is %0awhen the pomegranate is in flower, and are of opinion that it %0aought to be transplanted as soon as it has thrown out five %0aleaves. There is a singular difference—if indeed it really %0aexists—^between the two varieties of beet, the white kind %0abeing remarkable for its purgative qualities, and the black %0abeing equally astringent. When wine in the vat has been %0adeteriorated by assuming a flavour like*’ that of cabbage, its %0aoriginal flavour is restored, it is said, by plunging beet leaves %0ainto it. %0a%0a^ It was only the leaf of beet, and not the root, that was eaten by the %0aancients. From Martial, B. xiii. Epig. 10, we learn that the leaves were %0apreserved in a mixture of wine and pepper. %0a%0a^5 Though not positively unwholesome, the leaves would form an insipid %0adish, that would not agree with all stomachs. Galen says that it cannot %0ahe eaten in great quantities with impunity, but Diphilus the physician, as %0aquoted by Athenseus, B. ix. c. 3, says the reverse. Some MSS. read here %0a“ innocentiorem,” “ more harmless.” %0a%0aColumella says the same, De Re Rust. B. xi. c. 3. %0a%0aFee would seem to render this, “ when wine has been spoiled by cab¬ %0abage leaves being mixed with it.” %0a%0a%0aChap. 41.] CABBAGES ; SEVERAL VARIETIES OE THEM. %0a%0a%0a185 %0a%0a%0aCHAT. 41 —cabbages; the several varieties of them. %0a%0aCabbage and coleworts, which at the present day are the %0amost highly esteemed of all the garden vegetables, were held %0ain little repute, I find, among the Greeks; but Cato,^® on the %0aother hand, sings the wondrous praises of the cabbage, the %0amedicinal properties of which we shall duly enlarge^® upon %0awhen we come to treat of that subject. Cato distinguishes %0athree varieties of the cabbage; the first, a plant with leaves %0awide open, and a large stalk; a second, with crisped leaves, to %0awhich he gives the name of “apiaca;”®“ and a third, with a %0athin stalk, and a smooth, tender leaf, which with him ranks %0athe lowest of all. Cabbages may be sown the whole year %0athrough, as we find that they are cut at all periods of the year; %0athe best time, however, for sowing them is at the autumnal %0aequinox, and they are usually transplanted as soon as five %0aleaves are visible. In the ensuing spring after the first cut¬ %0ating, the plant yields sprouts, known to us as “cymae.”®* %0aThese sprouts, in fact, are small shoots thro'wn out from the %0amain stem, of a more delicate and tender quality than the %0acabbage itself. The exquisite palate, however, of Apicius®^ %0arejected these sprouts for the table, and his example was fol¬ %0alowed by the fastidious Drusus Caesar; who did not escape, %0ahowever, the censures of his father, Tiberius, for being so %0aover-nice. After the cymae have made their appearance the %0acabbage throws out its summer and autumn shoots, and then %0aits winter ones; after which, a new crop of cymae is produced, %0athere being no plant so productive as this, until, at last, it is %0aquite exhausted hy its extreme fertility. A second time for %0asowing cabbages is immediately after the vernal equinox, the %0aplants of this growth being transplanted at the end of spring, %0athat they may not run up into sprouts before coming to a top : %0aand a third sowing takes place about the summer solstice, the %0atransplanting being done in summer if the soil is moist, but, %0aif too dry, in autumn. When moisture and manure are sup¬ %0aplied in small quantities, the flavour of the cabbage is all the %0a%0a=^6 De Re Rust. cc. 156, 157.

Asses’ dung is the best %0aadapted for its growth. %0a%0aThe cabbage, too, is one of those articles so highly esteemed %0aby epicures; for which reason it will not be amiss if we speak %0aof it at somewhat greater length. To obtain plants equally %0aremarkable for their size and flavour, care must be taken first %0aof all to sow the seed in ground that has had a couple of turn¬ %0aings up, and then to follow up the shoots as they appear above %0aground by moulding them up, care being taken to throw up %0athe earth over them as they increase in luxuriance, and to let %0anothing but the summit appear above the surface. This kind %0ais known as the Tritian^ cabbage : in money and labour it %0acosts twice as much as any of the others. %0a%0aThe other varieties of the cabbage®* are numerous—there is %0athe Cumanian cabbage, with leaves that lie close to the ground, %0aand a wide, open head; the Aricinian®® cabbage, too, of no %0agreater height, but with more numerous leaves and thinner— %0athis last is looked upon as the most useful of them all, for %0abeneath nearly all of the leaves there are small shoots thrown %0aout, peculiar to this variety. The cabbage, again, of Pompeii®* %0ais considerably taller, the stalk, which is thin at the root, %0aincreasing in thickness as it rises among the leaves, which are %0afewer in number and narrower; the great merit of this cab¬ %0abage is its remarkable tenderness, although it is not able to %0astand the cold. The cabbage of Eruttium,®®’ on the other hand, %0athrives all the better for cold; the leaves of it are remarkably %0alarge, the stalk thin, and the flavour pungent. The leaves, %0aagain, of the Sabine®® cabbage are crisped to such a degree as %0ato excite our surprise, and their thickness is such as to quite %0aexhaust the stem ; in sweetness, however, it is said to surpass %0aall the others. %0a%0aThere have lately come into fashion the cabbqges known as %0athe “ Lacuturres;”®® they are grown in the valley of Aricia, %0a%0aThe Brassica oleracea capitata of Lamarck, and its varieties. %0a%0aThe ordinary cabbage, or Brassica oleracea of Linneeus. %0a%0aA variety, Fee thinks, of the Lacuturrian cabbage. %0a%0aThe Brassica oleracea botrytis of Linnaeus, the cauliflower. %0a%0aOr Calabrian cabbage : it has not been identified. %0a%0a^ The Brassica oleracea Sabellica of Linnaeus, or fringed cabbage. %0a%0aOr “Lake-towers.” Tlie turnip-cabbage or rape-colewort, the Bras- %0asioa oleracea gongyloides of Linnaeus. %0a%0a%0aCbap. 41.] CABBAGES ; SETERAL VARIETIES OF THEM. 187 %0a%0a•where there was formerly a lake, now no longer in existence, %0aand a tower wdiich is still standing. The head of this cabbage %0ais very large, and the leaves are almost without number, some %0aof them being round and smooth, and others long and sinewy; %0aindeed, there is no cabbage that runs to a larger head than this, %0awith the sole exception of the Tritian variety, "which has a %0ahead sometimes as much as a foot in thickness, and throw's out %0aits cymse the latest of all. %0a%0aIn all kinds of cabbages, hoar-frost contributes very mate¬ %0arially to their sweetness ; but it is apt to be productive of con¬ %0asiderable injury, if care is not taken, to protect the pith by %0acutting them aslant. Those plants which are intended for %0aseed are never cut. %0a%0aThere is another kind, again, that is held in peculiar esteem, %0aand which never exceeds the height of an herbaceous plant; %0ait is known by the name of “ halmyridia,” from the circum¬ %0astance of its growing on the sea-shore*“ only. It will keep green %0aand fresh during a long voyage even, if care is taken not to let %0ait touch the ground from the moment that it is cut, but to put %0ait into oil-vessels lately dried, and then to bung them so as %0ato effectually exclude all air. There are some who are of %0aopinion, that the plant will come to maturity all the sooner %0aif some sea-weed is laid at the root when it is transplanted, %0aor else as much pounded nitre as can be taken up with three %0afingers; and others, again, sprinkle the leaves with trefoil seed %0aand nitre pounded together.^ Nitre, too, preserves the green¬ %0aness of cabbage when cooked, a result which is equally ensured %0aby the Apician mode of boiling, or in other words, by steeping %0athe plants in oil and salt before they are cooked. %0a%0aThere is a method of grafting vegetables by cutting the %0ashoots and the stalk, and then inserting in the pith the seed %0a%0aGenerally thought to be the Cramhe maritima of botanists, sea-ca.h- %0ahage, or sea-kale.

We have already^® %0aspoken at considerable length of its origin, when treating of %0atlie wild plants, and have mentioned that Cato recommends %0ait to be grown in reed-beds. There is another kind, again, of %0aa more uncultivated nature than the garden asparagus, but less %0apungent than corruda it grows upon the mountains in dif¬ %0aferent countries, and the plains of Upper Germany are quite %0afull of it, so much so, indeed, that it was a not unhappy remark %0aof Tiberius Caesar, that a weed grows there which bears a re¬ %0amarkably strong resemblance to asparagus. That which grows %0aspontaneously upon the island of Nesis, off the coast of Cam¬ %0apania, is looked upon as being by far the best of all. %0a%0aGarden asparagus is reproduced from roots,®* the fibres of %0awhich are exceedingly numerous, and penetrate to a consider¬ %0aable depth.

He re¬ %0acommends that the ground prepared for it should be a moist or %0adense soil, the seed being set at intervals of half a foot every %0away, to avoid treading upon the heads; the seed, he says, %0ashould be put two or three into each hole, these being made %0awith the dibble as the line runs—for in his day, it should be %0aremembered, asparagus was only grown from seed—this being %0adone about the vernal equinox. It requires, he adds, to be %0aabundantly manured, and to be kept well hoed, due care being %0ataken not to pull up the young plants along with the weeds. %0aThe first year, he says, the plants must be protected from the %0aseverity of the winter with a covering of straw, care being %0ataken to uncover them in the spring, and to hoe and stub up %0athe ground about them. In the spring of the third year, the %0aplants must be set fi.re to, and the earlier the period at which %0athe fire is applied, the better they will thrive. Hence it is, %0athat as reed-beds grow all the more rapidly after being fired, %0aasparagus is found to be a crop remarkably well suited for %0agrowing with them. The same author recommends, however, %0athat asparagus should not be hoed before the plants have made %0atheir appearance above-ground, for fear of disturbing the roots ; %0aand he says that in gathering the heads, they should be cut %0aclose to the root, and not broken off at the surface, a method %0awhich is sure to make them run to stalk and die. They should %0abe cut, he says, until they are left to run to seed, and after the %0aseed is ripe, in spring they must be fired, care being taken, as %0asoon as they appear again, to hoe and manure them as before. %0aAfter eight or nine years, he says, when the plants have be¬ %0acome old, they must be renewed, after digging and manuring %0athe ground, by replanting the roots at intervals of a foot, care %0abeing taken to employ sheep’s dung more particularly for the %0apurpose, other kinds of manure being apt to produce weeds. %0a%0aHo method of cultivating this plant that has since been tried %0ahas been found more eligible than this, with the sole exception %0athat the seed is now sown about the ides of Pebruary, b)'^ laving %0a“ De Re Rust. c. 161.

There is %0ano soil more favourable to the gi*owth of asparagus, than that %0aof the gardens of llavenna.“ %0a%0aWe have already spoken of the corruda, by which term I %0amean the wild asparagus, bj'- the Greeks called “ orminos,” or %0a“ myacanthos,” as well as by other names.

For %0ait is a well-known fact, that some small plots of land, planted %0awith thistles,®® in the vicinity of Great Carthage and of Cor- %0aduba more particularly, produce a yearly income of six thousand %0asesterces;®® this being the way in which we make the mon¬ %0astrous productions even of the earth subservient to our glut¬ %0atonous appetites, and that, too, when the very four-footed %0abrutes ®’ instinctively refuse to touch them. %0a%0aThistles are grown two different ways, from plants set in %0aautumn, and from seed sown before the nones of Marchin %0aAvhich latter case they are transplanted before the ides of No¬ %0avember,®® or, where the site is a cold one, about the time that %0athe west winds prevail. They are sometimes manured even, %0a%0a52 On the contrary. Martial says that the asparagus of Eavenna was no %0abetter than so much wild asparagus. %0a%0aIll B. xvi. c. 67.

The %0abest time for sowing ocimum,®* it is said, is at the festival of the %0aParilia ;®* though some say that it may be done in autumn as %0awell, and recommend, when it is sown in winter, to drench %0athe seed thoroughly with vinegar. Eocket,®® too, and nastur¬ %0atium®® may be grown with the greatest facility either in sum¬ %0amer or winter. Eocket, more particularly, is able to stand %0athe cold, and its properties are quite different from those of %0athe lettuce, as it is a great provocative of lust. Hence it is %0athat we are in the habit of mixing these two plants in our %0adishes, the excess of cold in the one being compensated by the %0aequal degree of heat in the other. Nasturtium has received %0athat name from®* the smarting sensation which its pungency %0acauses to the nostrils, and hence it is that a certain notion of %0asmartness has attached itself to the word, it having become quite %0aa proverbial saying, that a sluggish man should eat nasturtium, %0ato arouse him from his torpidity. In Arabia, it is said, this %0aplant attains a size that is quite marvellous. %0a%0aCHAP. 45. —RUE. %0a%0aEue,®® too, is generally sown while the west winds prevail, %0aas well as just after the autumnal equinox. This plant has an %0aextreme aversion to cold, moisture, and dung; it loves dry, %0asunny localities, and a soil more particularly that is rich in %0abrick clay ; it requires to be nourished, too, with ashes, which %0a%0a®” “ Si Dis placet.” ®* Oxyrael. %0a%0a®' This is evidently said contemptuously. %0a%0a®® See further as to the identity of this plant, B. xx. c. 48. %0a%0a®* Twenty-second of April. %0a%0a®® Brassica eruca of Linnmus.

The ancients held rue in peculiar %0aesteem ; for I find that honied wine flavoured with rue was %0adistributed to the people, in his consulship,®^ by Cornelius %0aCethegus, the colleague of Quintus Flamininus, after the %0aclosing of the Comitia. This plant has a great liking™ for the %0afig-tree, and for that tree only ; indeed, it never thrives better %0athan when grown beneath that tree. It is generally grown %0afrom slips, the lower end of which is inserted in a perforated^* %0abean, which holds it fast, and so nurtures the young plant %0awith its juices. It also reproduces itself;™ for the ends of the %0abranches bending downw'ards, the moment they reach the %0aground, they take root again. Ocimum'*® is of a very similar %0anature to rue, except that it dries with greater difficulty. %0aWhen rue has once gained strength, there is considerable diffi¬ %0aculty in stubbing it, as it causes itching ulcerations on the %0ahands, if they are not covered or previously protected by being %0arubbed with oil. Its leaves, too, are preserved, being packed %0ain bundles for keeping. %0a%0aCHAP. 46. —PAESLEY. %0a%0aParsley is sown immediately after the vernal equinox, the %0aseed being lightly beaten™ first in a mortar. It is thought %0athat, by doing this, the parsley will be all the more crisped, %0aor else by taking care to beat it down when sown with a roller %0aor the feet. It is a peculiarity of this plant, that it changes %0acolour: it has the honour, in Achaia, of forming the wreath %0aof the victors in the sacred contests of the Nemean Games. %0a%0aCHAP. 47. -MINT. %0a%0aIt is at the same season, too, that mint™ is transplanted; or, %0a%0aA.u.c. 421. %0a%0a^•0 It so happens that it thrives best on the same soil as the fig-tree. %0a%0a■’1 This practice has no beneficial eflPect whatever. %0a%0aThis is not the fact; for its branches never come in- contact with the %0aground. %0a%0aPliny has derived the greater part of this Chapter from Theophrastus, %0aHist.

This plant, too, is no less fond of a %0ahumid soil than parsley ; it is green in summer and turns %0ayellow in winter. There is a wild kind of mint, known to us %0aas “ mentastrum it is reproduced by layers, like the vine, %0aor else by planting the branches upside down. It was the %0asweetness of its smell that caused this plant to change its name %0aamong the Greeks, its former name with them being “ mintha,” %0afrom which the ancient Romans derived their name” for it; %0awhereas now, of late, it has been called by them T^hxioCfiovP %0aThe mint that is used in the dishes at rustic entertainments %0apervades the tables far and wide with its agreeable odour. %0aWhen once planted, it lasts a considerable length of time ; it %0abears, too, a strong resemblance to pennyroyal, a property of %0awhich is, as mentioned by us more than once,'® to flower when %0akept in our larders. %0a%0aThese other herbs, mint, I mean, and catmint, as well as %0apennyroyal, are all kept for use in a similar manner; but it is %0acummin**® that is the best suited of all the seasoning herbs to %0asqueamish and delicate stomachs. This plant grows on the %0asurface of the soil, seeming hardly to adhere to it, and raising %0aitself aloft from the ground : it ought to be sown in the middle %0aof the summer, in a ci’umbly, warm soil, more particularly. %0aThere is another wild kind”' of cummin, known by some per- %0a‘sons as “rustic,” by others as “Thebaic” cummin: bruised %0aand drunk in water, it is good for pains in the stomach. The %0acummin most esteemed in our part of the world is that of %0aCarpetania,®® though elsewhere that of Africa and ^Ethiopia %0ais more highly esteemed ; with some, indeed, this last is pre¬ %0aferred to that of Egypt. %0a%0aCHAP. 48.-OLtrSATRUM. %0a%0aBut it is olusatrum,“ more particularly, that is of so singular %0a%0aCalled by the Greeks KaXafiivOri, according to Apuleius. %0a%0aOr “ Mentha.” '** “ Sweet-suielliug.” %0a%0a“ Stepius.” See B. xviii'. c. 60. %0a%0aThe Cuniinum cyminum cf botanists.

Of the cultivated poppy* there %0aare three kinds, the first being the white* poppy, the seed of %0awhich, parched, and mixed with honey, used to be served up %0ain the second course at the tables of the ancients; at the pre¬ %0asent day, too, the country people sprinkle it on the upper crust %0aof their bread, making it adhere by means of the yolk of eggs, %0athe under crust being seasoned with parsley and gith to %0aheighten the flavour of the flour. The second kind is the %0ablack'* poppy, from which, upon an incision being made in the %0astalk, a milky juice distils; and the third is that known to the %0aGreeks bv the name of “rhceas;”® and by us as the wild %0apoppy. This last grows spontaneouslj^ but in fields, more %0aparticularly, which have been sown with barley : it bears a %0astrong resemblance to rocket, grows to the height of a cubit, %0aand bears a red flower, which quickly fades; it is to this %0aflower that it is indebted for its Greek name.® %0a%0aAs to the other kinds of poppies which spring up sponta- %0aneousl)', we shall have occasion to speak of them when treat¬ %0aing of the medicinal plants.’ That the poppy has always been %0aheld in esteem among the Eomans, we have a proof in the %0astory related of Tarquinius® Supcrbus, who, by striking down %0athe tallest poppies in his garden, surreptitiously conveyed, %0a%0a1 This practice, as Fee remarks, is not followed; and indeed, unless it %0ais intended to transplant them, it would be attended with injurious results %0ato the young plants. %0a%0a® As to the poppy, for further particulars see B. xx. c. 76 and the Note. %0a%0a3 The variety Album of the Papaver somniferum of modern botanists. %0a%0a* The variety Nigrum of the Papaver somniferum.

This last, though %0ait will grow without cultivation, is considerably improved by %0abeing transplanted; though, on the other hand, it is extremel}" %0adilRcult to rid the soil of it when once sown there, the seed %0awhen it falls germinating immediately. This seed, when %0acooked in the saucepan," is employed even for making ragouts, %0aits pungency being rendered imperceptible by boiling; the %0aleaves, too, are boiled just the same way as those of other %0avegetables. %0a%0aThere are three different kinds of mustard,'* the first of a %0athin, slender form, the second, with a leaf like that of the %0arape, and the third, wdth that of rocket: the best seed comes %0afrom Egypt.

Then, %0atoo, there is hemp,®® a plant remarkably useful for making %0aropes, and usually sown after the west winds have begun to %0aprevail: the more thickly it is sown, the thinner are the %0astalks. The seed is gathered when ripe, just after the autumnal %0aequinox, and is dried by the agency of the sun, the wind, or %0asmoke.®' The hemp itself is plucked just after vintage-time, %0aand is peeled and cleaned by the labourers at night. %0a%0aThe best hemp is that of Alabanda,®® which is used more %0aparticular!}' for making hunting-nets, and of which there are %0athree varieties. The hemp which lies nearest the bark or the %0apith is the least valuable, while that which lies in the middle, %0aand hence has the name of “ mesa,” is the most esteemed. %0aThe hemp of Mylasa®® occupies the second rank.

(10.) -THE MALADIES OF GAEDEN PLANTS. %0a%0aThe garden plants, too, like the rest of the vegetable pro¬ %0aductions, are subject to certain maladies. Thus, for'^ instance, %0aocimum, when old, degenerates into wild thyme, and sisym¬ %0abrium” into mint, while the seed of an old cabbage produces %0arape, and vice versa. Cummin, too, if not kept well hoed, is %0akilled by haernodorum,^® a plant with»a single stalk, a root si¬ %0amilar to a bulb in appearance, and never found except in a %0athin, meagre soil, Eesides this, cummin is liable to a peculiar %0adisease of its own, the scab ocimum, too, turns pale at the %0arising of the Dog-star. All plants, indeed, will turn of a %0ayellow complexion on the approach of a woman who has the %0amenstrual discharge®® upon her. %0a%0a'J'here are various kinds of insects,” too, that breed upon the %0agarden plants—fleas, for instance, upon turnips, and cater¬ %0apillars and maggots upon radishes, as well as lettuces and cab¬ %0abages ; besides which, the last two are exposed_ to the attacks %0aof slugs and snails. The leek, too, is infested with peculiar %0ainsects of its own ; which may very easily be taken, however, %0aby laying dung upon the plants, the insects being in the habit %0aof burrowing in it. Sabin us Tiro says, in his book entitled %0a“ Cepurica,”®^ which he dedicated to Maecenas, that it is not %0aadvisable to touch rue, cuuila, mint, or ocimum with any im¬ %0aplement of iron. %0a%0aThese absurd notions are borrowed from Theophrastus, De Causis, c. 8. %0a%0aSee B.

HOW %0a%0aANTS ARE BEST DESTROYED. THE BEST REMEDIES AGAINST CATER¬ %0aPILLARS AND FLIES. %0a%0aThe same author recommenrls as a remedy against ants, %0awhich are by no means the slightest plague in a garden that is %0anot kept well watered, to stop up the mouths of their holes with %0asca-slime or ashes. But the most efficient way of destroj’ing %0athem is with the aid of the plant heliotropium some per¬ %0asons, too, are of opinion that water in which an unburnt brick %0ahas been soaked is injurious to them. The best protection for %0aturnips is to sow a few fitebes with them, and for cabbages chick¬ %0apeas, these having the effect of keeping away caterpillars. If, %0ahowever, this precaution should have been omitted, and the %0acaterpillars have alreadj'’ made their appearance, the best remedy %0ais to throw upon the vegetables a decoction of wormwood,*^ or %0aelse of house-leek,^* known to some as “ aizoiim,” a kind of %0aherb already mentioned by us. If cabbage-seed, before it is %0asown, is steeped in the juice of house-leek, the cabbages, it is %0asaid, are sure not be attacked b}’’ any insect. %0a%0aIt is said, too, that all caterpillars may be effectually exter¬ %0aminated, if the skull of a beast of burden is set up upon a %0astake in the garden, care being taken to employ that of a female %0aonly. There is a story related, too, that a river crab, hung %0aup in the middle of the garden, is a preservative against the %0aattacks of caterpillars. Again, there are some persons who are %0ain the habit of touching with slips of blood-red cornel** such %0a])lant8 as they wish to preserve from caterpillars. Flies,*® too, %0ainfest well-watered gardens, and more particularly so, if there %0ahappen to be any shrubs there ; they may be got rid of, how¬ %0aever, by burning galbanum.^® %0a%0a(11.)

All the summer %0aseeds, too, last longer than the winter ones ; but scallion seed %0ais the very worst for keeping of them all. But of those, even, %0awhich keep the very longest, there is none that will keep be¬ %0ayond four years—for sowing purposes, at least; for culinary %0apurposes, they are fit for use beyond that period. %0a%0aCHAP. 59.— WHA.T PLANTS ABE BENEFITTED BY SALT WATER. %0a%0aA peculiar remedy for the maladies to which radishes, beet, %0arue, and cunila are subject, is salt water, which has also the %0aadditional merit of conducing ver}" materially to their sweet¬ %0aness and fertility. Other plants, again, are equally benefitted %0aby being watered with fresh water, the most desirable for the %0apurpose being that which is the coldest and the sweetest to %0adrink: pond and drain-water, on the other hand, are not so %0agood, as they are apt to carry the seeds of weeds along with %0athem. It is rain,*^ however, that forms the principal aliment %0aof plants; in addition to Avliich, it kills the insects as they %0adevelope themselves upon them. %0a%0aCH.AP. 60. (12.)- THE PROPER METHOD OF WATERING GARDENS. %0a%0aThe proper times for watering are the morning and the %0aevening, to prevent the water from being heated by the sun ; %0awith the sole exception, however, of ocimum, which requires %0ato be watered at midday; indeed, this plant, it is generally %0athought, will grow with additional rapiditj’, if it is watered %0awith boiling water when sown. All plants, when trans- %0a%0aTliis is certainly not true with reference to the leguminous and gra¬ %0amineous plants. It is pretty generally known as a fact, that wheat has %0agerminated after being buried in tlie eartii two thousand years : murnmy- %0awheat, at the present day, is almost universally known. %0a%0aEain-water, if collected in cisterns, and exposed to the heat of the %0asun, is the most beneficial of all; rain has the efl'ect also of killing nume¬ %0arous insects which have bred in the previous drought. %0a%0aFrom Theophrastus, II. vii. c. 5. Evening is generally preferred to %0amorning for tliis purpose; the evaporation not being so quick, and the %0aplant profiting more from the water. > %0a%0aIt should, however, be of a middling temperature, and warmed to %0asome extent by the rays of the sun. %0a%0a%0a202 %0a%0a%0aflint's natural histort. %0a%0a%0a[Book XIX, %0a%0a%0aplanted, grow all the better and larger for it, leeks and turnips %0amore particularly. Transplanting, too, is attended with cer¬ %0atain remedial effects, and acts as a preservative to certain plants, %0asuch as scallions, for instance, leeks, radishes, parsley, lettuces, %0arape, and cucumbers. All the wild plantsare generally %0asmaller in the leaf and stalk than the cultivated ones, and have %0amore acrid juices, cunila, wild marjoram, and rue, for example. %0aTudeed, it is only the lapathum that is better in a wild state %0athan cultivated : in its cultivated state it is the same plant %0athat is known to us as the “rumix,” being the most vigorous*® %0aby far of all the plants that are grown ; so much so, indeed, %0athat it is said that when it has once taken root, it will last for %0aever, and can never be extirpated from the soil, more particu¬ %0alarly if water happens to be near at hand. Its juices, whicli %0aare employed only in ptisans,*® as an article of food, have tlie %0aeffect of imparting to them a softer and more exquisite flavour. %0aThe wild variety®® is employed for many medicinal purposes. %0a%0aSo true it is, that the careful research of man has omitted %0anothing, that I have even met with a poem,®* in which I fiud %0ait stated, that if pellets of goats’ dung, the size of a bean, are %0ahollowed out, and the seed of leeks, rocket, lettuces, parsley, %0aendive, and cresses is inserted in them, and then sown, the %0al)lants will thrive in a marvellous degi-ee.

As to panax, we have spoken of it at suflScient length %0aalready,® Libanotis grows in a thin, crumbly soil, and is %0agenerally sown in spots exposed to the falling dews ; the root, %0awhich is just like that of olusatrum,® has a smell in no waj' %0adiffering from that of frankincense ; when a year old, it is ex¬ %0atremely wholesome for the stomach ; some persons give it the %0aname of rosmarinum.® Smyrnium is a garden herb that grows %0ain similar soils, and has a root which smells like myrrh : sili- %0aquastrum, too, is grown in a similar manner. %0a%0aOther plants, again, differ from the preceding ones, both in %0asmell and taste, anise for example ; indeed, so great is the %0adifference in this respect, and in their relative virtues, that not %0aonly are the properties of each modified by the other, but quite %0aneutralized even. It is in this way that our cooks correct %0athe flavour of vinegar in their dishes with parsley, and our %0abutlers employ the same plant, enclosed in sachets, for removing %0aa bad odour in wine, %0a%0a“ See B.

I am here reminded of the %0a%3c fact, that we find it stated by M. Varro, that it is a custom %0a%3c peculiar to the family of the Serrani for the women never to %0a%3c wear garments of linen. In Germany it is in caves^® deep under¬ %0a%3c ground that the linen-weavers ply their work ; and the same %0a%3c is the case, too, in the Alian territory, in Italy, between the %0a%3c rivers Padus and Ticinus, the linen of which holds the third %0a%3c rank among the kinds manufactured in Europe, that of S®ta- %0a%3c bis claiming the first, and those of Retovium^® and of Eaven- %0a%3c %0a%3c This was the time for sowing it with the Romans, though in some %0a%3c countries, at the present day, it is sown so late as tlie autumn. %0a%3c %0a%3c In B. xviii. c. 72, he has spoken of this method of gathering vege¬ %0a%3c table productions as injurious to the soil, hy withdrawing its natmal %0a%3c juices. %0a%3c %0a%3c “ Censentur hoc reditu ?” There is little doubt that the Gauls, like %0a%3c their German neighbours, cultivated flax for the purposes of female dress, %0a%3c and not mainly for the manufacture of sails. %0a%3c %0a%3c “ Quod vocant inane.” He implies that the boundless space of %0a%3c ocean on the Western coasts of Gaul was useless for any purposes of navi¬ %0a%3c gation. %0a%3c %0a%3c See B. iv. c. 33.

The linens of Faventia are pre¬ %0a%3c ferred for whiteness to those of Alia, which are always un¬ %0a%3c bleached : those of Retovium are remarkable for their extreme %0a%3c fineness, combined with substance, and are quite equal in %0a%3c whiteness to the linens of Faventia; but they have none of %0a%3c that fine downy nap upon them, which is so highly esteemed %0a%3c by some persons, though equally disliked by others. A thread %0a%3c is made, too, from their flax, of considerable strength, smoother %0a%3c and more even, almost, than the spider’s web; when tested %0a%3c with the teeth, it emits a sharp, clear twang; hence it is, that %0a%3c it sells at double the price of the other kinds. %0a%3c %0a%3c But it is the province of Nearer Spain that produces a linen %0a%3c of the greatest lustre, an advantage which it owes to the waters %0a%3c of a stream which washes the city of Tarraco” there. The fine¬ %0a%3c ness, too, of t|iis linen is quite marvellous, and here it is that %0a%3c the first manufactories of cambric'® were established. From %0a%3c the same province, too, of Spain, the flax of Zoela has of late %0a%3c years been introduced into Italy, and has been found extremely %0a%3c serviceable for the manufacture of hunting-nets. Zoela is a %0a%3c city of Callfficia, in the vicinity of the Ocean. The flax, too, %0a%3c of Cumae, in Campania, has its own peculiar merits in the %0a%3c manufacture of nets for fishing and fowling ; it is employed, %0a%3c also, for making hunting-nets. For it is from flax, in fact, %0a%3c that we prepare various textures, destined to be no less insi¬ %0a%3c dious to the brute creation than they are to ourselves. It is %0a%3c with toils made from the flax of Cum® that wild boars are %0a%3c taken, the meshes being proof against their bristles,®® equally %0a%3c with the edge of the knife : before now, too, we have seen some %0a%3c of these toils of a fineness so remarkable®^ as to allow of being %0a%3c %0a%3c “ Lanugo.” This is not generally looked upon as a merit in linen, at %0a%3c tlie present day. %0a%3c %0a%3c Now Tarragona. See B. iii. c. 4. %0a%3c %0a%3c “ Carbasus.” This was probably the Spanish name originally for fine %0a%3c flax, and henee came to signify the eambrics, or fine linen tissues made of %0a%3c it. It seems, however, to have afterwards been extended to all kinds of %0a%3c linen tissues, as we find the name given indifferently to linen garments, %0a%3c sail-cloth, and awnings for the theatres. %0a%3c %0a%3c ” See B. iii. c. 4. %0a%3c %0a%3c “ Ssetas ceu per ferri aciem vincunt.” This passage is probably in a %0a%3c mutilated state. %0a%3c %0a%3c There must cither be some corruption in the text, or else Pliny must %0a%3c have been mistaken. Nets such as these could have been of no possible %0a%3c use in taking a wild boar. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 134 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Pliny's natuual history. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XIX. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c passed through a man’s ring, running ropes and all, a single %0a%3c individual being able to carry an amount of nets sufficient to %0a%3c environ a whole forest—a thing which we know to have been %0a%3c done not long ago by Julius Lupus, w'ho died prefect of Egypt. %0a%3c This, however, is nothing very surprising, but it really is quite %0a%3c wonderful that each of the cords was composed of no less %0a%3c than one hundred and fifty threads. Those, no doubt, will be %0a%3c astonished at this, who are not aware that there is preserved %0a%3c in the Temple of Minerva, at Lindus, in the Isle of llhodes, %0a%3c the cuirass of a former king of Egypt, Amasis by name, each %0a%3c thread employed in the texture of which is composed of three %0a%3c hundred aud sixty-five other threads. Mucianus, who was %0a%3c three times consul, informs us that he saw this curiosity very %0a%3c recently, though there was but little then remaining of it, in %0a%3c consequence of the injury it had experienced at the hands of %0a%3c various persons who had tried to verify the fact. Italy, too, %0a%3c holds the flax of the Peligni in high esteem, though it is only %0a%3c employed by fullers; there is no kind known that is whiter %0a%3c than this, or which bears a closer resemblance to wool. That %0a%3c grown by the CadurcP^ is held in high estimation for making %0a%3c mattresses;^^ which, as well as flock,are an invention for which %0a%3c we are indebted to the Gauls : the ancient usage of Italy is %0a%3c still kept in remembrance in the word “ stramentum,”®* the %0a%3c name given by us to beds stuffed with straw. %0a%3c %0a%3c The flax of Egypt, though the least strong^® of all as a tissue, %0a%3c is that from which the greatest profits are derived. There are %0a%3c four varieties of it, the Tanitic, the Pelusiac, the Putic, and %0a%3c the Tentyritic—so called from the various districts in which %0a%3c they are respectively grown. The upper part of Eg5rpt, in %0a%3c the vicinity of Arabia, produces a shrub, known by some as %0a%3c “ gossypium,” ” but by most persons as “xylon;” hence the %0a%3c %0a%3c 32 See B. iv. c. 33.

Hasselquist speaks of it %0a%3c attaining a height of fifteen feet. %0a%3c %0a%3c ^ 37 Our cotton, the Gossypium arhoreum of Linnmus. See B. xii. c. 21. %0a%3c The terms xylon, byssus, and gossypium, must be regarded as synonymous, %0a%3c being applied sometimes to the plant, sometimes to the raw cotton, and %0a%3c sometimes to the tissues made from it. Gossypium was probably the bar¬ %0a%3c barous name of the cotton tree, and byssus perhaps a corruption of its %0a%3c Hebrew name. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 3.] THE MODE OF PREPAKIKG FLAX. 135 %0a%3c %0a%3c name of “ xylina,” given to the tissues that are manufactured %0a%3c from it. The shrub is small, and bears a fruit, similar in %0a%3c appearance to a nut with a beard, and containing in the inside %0a%3c a silky substance, the down of which is spun into threads. %0a%3c There is no tissue known, that is superior to those made from %0a%3c this thread, either for whiteness, softness, or dressing: the %0a%3c most esteemed vestments worn by the priests of Egypt are %0a%3c made of it. There is a fourth kind of tissue, known by the %0a%3c name of “othouinura,” which is made from a kind of marsh- %0a%3c reed,®® the panicule only being employed for the purpose. In %0a%3c Asia, again, there is a thread made from broom,®® which is %0a%3c employed in the construction of fishing-nets, being found to %0a%3c be remarkably durable; for the purpose of preparing it, the %0a%3c shrub is steeped in water for ten days. The -Ethiopians, also, %0a%3c and the people of India, prepare a kind of thread from a fruit %0a%3c which resembles our apple, and the Arabians, as already" men¬ %0a%3c tioned, from gourds that grow upon trees. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 3. —THE MODE OF PKEPAEING FLAX. %0a%3c %0a%3c In our part of the world the ripeness of flax is usually %0a%3c ascertained by two signs, the swelling of the seed, and its %0a%3c assuming a yellowish tint. It is then pulled up by the roots, %0a%3c made up into small sheaves that will just fill the hand, and %0a%3c hung to dry in the sun. It is suspended with the roots %0a%3c upwards the first day, and then for the five following days the %0a%3c heads of the sheaves are placed, reclining one against the other, %0a%3c in such a way that the seed which drops out may fall into the %0a%3c middle. Linseed is employed for various medicinal"’ purposes, %0a%3c and it is used by the country-people of Italy beyond the Padus %0a%3c in a certain kind of food, which is remarkable for its sweet- %0a%3c %0a%3c Probably the Arundo donax of modern botanists. See B. xvi. c. 66. %0a%3c %0a%3c Fee says, that the people of Pisa, at the present day, soak the stalks %0a%3c of broom, and extract therefrom a thread, of which cords and coarse stuffs %0a%3c arc made. %0a%3c %0a%3c In B. xii. c. 21. He seems there to speak of the cotton-tree, though' %0a%3c Fee suggests that he may possibly allude to the “ Bombax pentandrum” of %0a%3c Linnaeus. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is the mucilage of the perisperm that is so useful in medicine. %0a%3c As an article of food, the farina of linseed is held in no esteem whatever. %0a%3c In times of scarcity, attempts have been made to mix it with flour or meal, %0a%3c but the result has been found to be heavy and indigestible, and has caused, %0a%3c it is said, the death even of those who have eaten of it in considerable %0a%3c quantities. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 136 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Pliny’s natueal histoet. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XIX. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ness : for this long time past, however, it has only been in gene¬ %0a%3c ral use for sacrifices offered to the divinities. After the wheat %0a%3c harvest is over, the stalks of flax are plunged in water that %0a%3c has been warmed in the sun, and are then submitted to pres¬ %0a%3c sure with a weight; for there,is nothing known that is more %0a%3c light and buoyant than this. When the outer coat is loosened, %0a%3c it is a sign that the stalks have been sufficiently steeped ; after %0a%3c which^^ they are again turned with the heads downwards, and %0a%3c left to dry as before in the sun : when thoroughly dried, they %0a%3c are beaten with a tow-mallet on a stone. %0a%3c %0a%3c The part that lies nearest to the outer coat is knowE by the %0a%3c name of “stuppa;” it is a flax of inferior quality, and is %0a%3c mostly employed for making the wicks of lamps. This, how¬ %0a%3c ever, requires to be combed out with iron hatchels, until the %0a%3c whole of the oiiter skin is removed. The inner part presents %0a%3c numerous varieties of flax, esteemed respectively in propor¬ %0a%3c tion to their whiteness and their softness. Spinning flax is %0a%3c held^ to be an honourable^^ employment for men even: the %0a%3c husks, or outer coats, are employed for heating furnaces and %0a%3c ovens. There is a certain amount of skill required in hatchel- %0a%3c ling flax and dressing it: it is a fair proportion for fifty pounds %0a%3c in the sheaf to yield fifteen pounds of flax combed out. When %0a%3c spun into thread, it is rendered additionally supple by being %0a%3c soaked in water and then beaten out upon a stone; and after %0a%3c it is woven into a tissue, it is again beaten with heavy maces: %0a%3c indeed, the more roughly it is treated the better it is. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 4. —LINEN MADE OP ASBESTOS. %0a%3c %0a%3c There has been invented also a kind of linen which is in¬ %0a%3c combustible by flame.

The wicks of the inextinguishable lamps of the middle ages, the %0a%3c existence of which was an article of general belief, were said to be made %0a%3c of asbestus.

It is from this material %0a%3c that the corpse-cloths of monarchs are made, to ensure the %0a%3c separation of the ashes of the body from those of the pile. %0a%3c This substance grows^® in the deserts o'f India,^® scorched by %0a%3c the burning rays of the sun: here, where no rain is ever %0a%3c known to fall, and amid multitudes of deadly serpents, it be¬ %0a%3c comes habituated to resist the action of fire. Rarely to be %0a%3c found, it presents considerable difficulties in weaving it into a %0a%3c tissue, in consequence of its shortness; its colour is naturally %0a%3c red, and it only becomes Avhite through the agency of fire. %0a%3c By those who find it, it is sold at prices equal to those given %0a%3c for the finest pearls ; by the Greeks it is called “ asbestinon,”^’ %0a%3c a name which indicates its peculiar properties. Anaxilaiis^® %0a%3c makes a statement to the effect that if a tree is surrounded %0a%3c Avith linen made of this substance, the noise of the blows %0a%3c given by the axe will be deadened thereby, and that the tree may %0a%3c be cut down without their being heard. For these qualities it %0a%3c is that this linen occupies the very highest rank among all the %0a%3c kinds that are known. %0a%3c %0a%3c The next rank is accorded to the tissue known as “ byssus,”^® %0a%3c an article which is held in the very highest estimation by %0a%3c females, and is produced in the vicinity of Elis, in Achaia.®° I %0a%3c find it stated by some writers that a scruple of this sold for- %0a%3c %0a%3c “Nascitur.” In the year 1702 there was found near the Naevian %0a%3c Gate, at Eome, a funereal urn, in which there was a skull, calcined bones, %0a%3c and other ashes, enclosed in a cloth of asbestus, of a marvellous length. %0a%3c It is still preserved in the Vatican. %0a%3c %0a%3c On the contrary, it is found in the Higher Alps in the vicinity of %0a%3c the Glaciers, in Scotland, and in Siberia, even. %0a%3c %0a%3c Signif 5 'ing “ inextinguishable,” from d, “ not,” and a^tvwiii, “ to %0a%3c extinguish.” See B. xxxvii. c. 54. %0a%3c %0a%3c See end of this Book. %0a%3c %0a%3c He evidently alludes to cotton fabrics under this name.

Judging from the variable temperature %0a%3c of the climate, it is very doubtful. Fee says, if cotton was grown there %0a%3c at all. Arrian, Apollonius, and Philostratus say that the tree which pro¬ %0a%3c duced the hyssm had the leaves of the willow, and the shape of the pop¬ %0a%3c lar, characteristics which certainly do not apply to the cotton-tree. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 138 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Pliny’s natural history. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XIX. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c merly at four denarii, the same rate, in fact, as gold.

It was with sails of purple, %0a%3c too, that Cleopatra accompanied M. Antonius to the battle of %0a%3c Actium, and it was by their aid that she took to flight: such %0a%3c being the distinguishing mark of the royal ship. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 6.—AT WHAT PERIOD COLOURED AWNINGS WERE FIRST %0a%3c EMPLOYED IN THE THEATRES. %0a%3c %0a%3c In more recent®* times linens alone have been employed %0a%3c for the purpose of affording shade in our theatres; Q. Catulus %0a%3c having been the flrst who applied them to this use, on %0a%3c the occasion of the dedication by him of the Capitol. At a %0a%3c later period, Lentulus Spinther, it is said, was the first to %0a%3c spread awnings of fine linen®® over the theatre, at the celebra¬ %0a%3c tion of the Games in honour of Apollo. After this, Caesar, %0a%3c %0a%3c Impure oxide of metals, collected from the chimneys of smelting-houses. %0a%3c Fee says that Pliny on this occasion is right. %0a%3c %0a%3c 52 In B. XX. c. 79, he speaks of the “ heraclion” poppy, supposed by %0a%3c some of the commentators to be identical with the one mentioned here. %0a%3c %0a%3c 53 Vestium insaniam.” %0a%3c %0a%3c 51 “ Postea." Sillig would reject this word, as being a corruption, and %0a%3c not consistent with fact, Catulus having lived before the time of Cleo¬ %0a%3c patra. He suggests that the reading should be “ Populo Romano ea in the- %0a%3c atris spectanti umbram fecere.” “ Linen, too, has provided a shade for %0a%3c the Roman people, when viewing the spectacles of the theatre.” Lucretius, %0a%3c B. iv, 1. 73, et seq., speaks of these awnings as being red, yellow, and %0a%3c iron grey. ss ti Clarbasina.” Cambric. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 7.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c THE NATURE OF SPARTUil. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 139 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c when Dictator, covered with a linen awning the whole of the %0a%3c Homan Forum, as well as the Sacred Way, from his Wn house %0a%3c as far as the ascent to the Capitol, a sight, it is said, more won¬ %0a%3c derful even than the show of gladiators which he then exhi¬ %0a%3c bited. At a still later period, and upon the occasion of no %0a%3c public games, Marcellus, the son of Octavia, sister of Augus¬ %0a%3c tus, during his eedileship, and in the eleventh consulship of his %0a%3c uncle, on the * * * day before the calends of August, covered %0a%3c in the Forum with awnings, his object being to consult the %0a%3c health of those assembled there for the purposes of litigation %0a%3c —a vast change, indeed, from the manners prevalent in the %0a%3c days of Cato the Censor, who expressed a wish that the %0a%3c Forum was paved with nothing else but sharp pointed stones. %0a%3c %0a%3c Awnings have been lately extended, too, by the aid of ropes, %0a%3c over the amphitheatres of the Emperor Nero, dyed azure, like %0a%3c the heavens, and bespangled all over with stars. Those which %0a%3c are employed by us to cover the inner court^ of our houses %0a%3c are generally red : one reason for employing them is to protect %0a%3c the moss that grows there from the rays*^ of the sun. In %0a%3c other respects, white fabrics of linen have always held the %0a%3c ascendancy in public estimation. Linen, too, was highly %0a%3c valued as early as the Trojan war; for why else should it not %0a%3c have figured as much in battles as it did in shipwrecks ?

It is found in one %0a%3c portion of the province of Carthage®^ in Nearer Spain, though %0a%3c not in every part of that; but wherever it is produced, the %0a%3c mountains, even, are covered all over with it. %0a%3c %0a%3c This material is employed by the country-people there for %0a%3c making®® their beds ; with it they kindle their fires also, and %0a%3c prepare their torches; shoes®® also,‘and garments for the shep¬ %0a%3c herds, are made of it.

It is then put to soak in sea-water, this being the %0a%3c best of all for the purpose, though fresh water will do in case %0a%3c sea- water cannot be procured : this done, it is again dried in %0a%3c the sun, and then moistened afresh. If it is wanted for im¬ %0a%3c mediate use, it is put in a tub and steeped in warm water, after %0a%3c which it is placed in an'tipfighF position to dry : this being %0a%3c universally admitted to be the most expeditious method of pre¬ %0a%3c paring it. To make it ready for use, it requires to be beaten %0a%3c out. Articles made of it are proof, more particularly, against %0a%3c the action of fresh or sea-water; but on dry land, ropes of hemp %0a%3c are generally preferred. Indeed, we hnd that spar turn receives %0a%3c nutriment even from being under water, by way of compen¬ %0a%3c sation, as it were, for the thirst it lias had to endure upon its %0a%3c native soil. %0a%3c %0a%3c By nature it is peculiarly well adapted for repairing, and %0a%3c however old the material may he, it unites very well with new. %0a%3c The person, indeed, who is desirous duly to appreciate this %0a%3c marvellous plant, has only to consider the numerous uses to %0a%3c which, in all parts of the world, it is applied: from it are %0a%3c made, the rigging of ships, various appliances of mechanism %0a%3c emploj’ed in building, and numerous other articles which supply %0a%3c the wants of daily life. To suffice for all these requirements, %0a%3c we find it growing solely on a tract of ground which lies upon %0a%3c the sea-line of the province of New Carthage, somewhat less %0a%3c than thirty miles in breadth by one hundred in length. ^ I he %0a%3c expense precludes its being transported to any very considera¬ %0a%3c ble distance. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 9. -AT WHAT PERIOD SPAETUM WAS FIRST EMPLOYED. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Greeks used formerly to employ the rush for making %0a%3c ropes; so, at least, we are led to believe, from the name*® given %0a%3c by them to that plant; and at a later period they made them, %0a%3c it is verj' clear, from the leaves of the palm, and the inner %0a%3c hark of the linden-tree.

It is found, in fact, in no way adhering to %0a%3c the earth, but enclosed within an outer coat; so much so, in¬ %0a%3c deed, that though we cannot exactly pronounce it to be com¬ %0a%3c posed of earth, we must conclude that it is nothing else but a %0a%3c callous’® concretion of the earth. - %0a%3c %0a%3c Fee is at a loss to identify this plant, but considers it quite clear %0a%3c that it is not the same with the Eriophorum augustifolium of Linnaeus, a %0a%3c cyperaceous plant, of which the characteristics are totally different. Do- %0a%3c donaeus, however, was inclined to consider them identical. %0a%3c %0a%3c ’* On the contrary, Theophrastus does mention it, in the Hist. Plant. %0a%3c B. i. c. 8, and speaks of it as having a bark composed of several tunics or %0a%3c membranes. %0a%3c %0a%3c In B. xiii. c. 13, and B. xv. c. 1. %0a%3c %0a%3c “ Tuber.” The Tuber cibarium of Linnaeus, the black truffle ; and %0a%3c probably the grey truffle, the Tuber griseum. %0a%3c %0a%3c This callous secretion of the earth, or corticle, is, as Fee says, a sort %0a%3c of hymcuium, formed of vesicles, which, as they develope themselves, are %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 12.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c MIST, ITON, AND GEEANION. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 143 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Truffles generally grow in dry, sandy soils, and spots that %0a%3c are thickly covered with shrubs; in size they are often larger %0a%3c than a quince, and are found to weigh as much '® as a pound. %0a%3c There are two kinds of them, the one full of sand, and con¬ %0a%3c sequently injurious to the teeth, the other free from sand and %0a%3c all impurities. They are distinguished also by their colour, %0a%3c which is red or black, and white within ; those of Africa ” %0a%3c are the most esteemed. Whether the truffle grows gradually, %0a%3c or whether this blemish of the earth—for it can be looked upon %0a%3c as nothing else—at once assumes the globular form and magni¬ %0a%3c tude which it presents when found; whether, too, it is pos¬ %0a%3c sessed of vitality or not, are all of them questions, which, in %0a%3c my opinion, are not easy to be solved. It decays and rots in %0a%3c a manner precisely similar to wood. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is known to me as a fact, that the following circumstance %0a%3c happened to Lartius Licinius, a person of praetorian rank, while %0a%3c minister of justice,™ a few years ago, at Carthage in Spain ; %0a%3c upon biting a truffle, he found a denarius inside, which all but %0a%3c broke his fore teeth—an evident proof that the truffle is no¬ %0a%3c thing else but an agglomeration of elementary earth. At all %0a%3c events, it is quite certain that the truffle belongs to those %0a%3c vegetable productions which spring up spontaneously, and are %0a%3c incapable of being reproduced from seed.™ %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 12. (3.) —MIST; iton; and geeanion. %0a%3c %0a%3c Of a similar nature, too, is the vegetable production known %0a%3c in the province of Cyrenaica by the name of “ misy,”®° re¬ %0a%3c found to contain diminutive truffles. Pliny is wrong in saying that the %0a%3c truffle forms neither cleft nor protuberance, as the exact contrary is the %0a%3c fact. %0a%3c %0a%3c ™ Haller speaks of truffles weighing as much as fourteen pounds. %0a%3c Valmont de Bomare speaks of a truffle commonly found in Savoy, which %0a%3c attains the weight of a pound. %0a%3c %0a%3c Those of Africa are in general similar to those found in Europe, but %0a%3c there is one peculiar to that country, possibly the same that is mentioned %0a%3c in the following Chapter under the name of ‘‘ misy.” %0a%3c %0a%3c “ Jura reddenti.” %0a%3c %0a%3c It is really propagated by spores, included in sinuous chambers in %0a%3c the interior; but, notwithstanding the attempts that have been made, it %0a%3c has never yet been cultivated with any degree of success. In c. 13, Pliny %0a%3c seems to recognize the possibility of its multiplication by germs, where he %0a%3c says that its formation is attributed by some to water. . %0a%3c %0a%3c Fee takes this to be the Tuber niveum of Desfentaines, the snow- %0a%3c white truffle. It is globular and somewhat piriform, grows to the size of a %0a%3c walnut, and sometimes of an orange, and is said to he most delicate eating. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 144 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c point’s natural history. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XIX, %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c markable for the sweetness of its smell and taste, but more %0a%3c fleshy than the truffle : the same, too, as to the iton of the %0a%3c Thracians, and the geranion of the Greeks. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 13. —PARTICULARS CONNECTED WITH THE TRUFFLE. %0a%3c %0a%3c The following peculiarities we find mentioned with reference %0a%3c to the truffle. When there have been showers in autumn, and %0a%3c frequent thunder-storms, truffles ai’e produced, thunder®^ con¬ %0a%3c tributing more particularly to their.developement; they do %0a%3c not, however, last beyond a year, and are considered the most %0a%3c delicate eating when gathered in spring. In some places the %0a%3c formation of them is attributed to water; as at Mytilene,®® for %0a%3c instance, where they are never to be found, it is said, unless %0a%3c the rivers overflow, and bring down the seed from Tiara, that %0a%3c being the name of a place at which they are produced in the %0a%3c greatest abundance. The finest truffles of Asia are those found %0a%3c in the neighbourhood of Lampsacus and Alopeconnesus; the %0a%3c best in Greece are those of the vicinity of Elis. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 14. -THE PEZICA. %0a%3c %0a%3c Belonging to the mushroom genus, also, there is a species, %0a%3c known to the Greeks by the name of “ pezica,”®* which grows %0a%3c without either root or stalk. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 15. -LASERPITIUM, LASER, AND MASPETUM. %0a%3c %0a%3c Next to these, laserpitium ®® claims our notice, a very re- %0a%3c %0a%3c These truffles or morels do not appear to have been identified. %0a%3c %0a%3c Juvenal alludes to this absurd notion, Sat. v. 1. 116. “The long %0a%3c ■wished-for thunder will provide a more ample repast.” %0a%3c %0a%3c Theophrastus, as quoted by Athenaeus, B. ii. speaks of this. %0a%3c %0a%3c “Peziza” was a name given by the ancients to a kind of cupuliform %0a%3c mushroom; in which, however, we cannot recognize the “ pezica” of %0a%3c Pliny. Some writers think that this was the same as the lycoperdon and %0a%3c geastrum of botanists, our puff-ball: while others take it to be the morel, %0a%3c the Morcliella esculenta, Sprengel in the number. Fee is inclined to be %0a%3c of opinion that an edible mushroom is meant, but is quite at a loss to %0a%3c identify it. %0a%3c %0a%3c Possibly the Ferula asafoetida of I.innaeus; or, according to some, the %0a%3c Thapsia silphium of Viviani, Flor. Lib. It was a plant common, accord¬ %0a%3c ing to ancient writers, to Syria, Armenia, Media, and Libya ; but it was %0a%3c the produce of this last country, probably, that afforded the juice or gum %0a%3c resin here mentioned as “laser,” and so highly esteemed by the ancients, as %0a%3c forming a component part of their perfumes. Fee is inclined to think %0a%3c that the Laserpitium here spoken of was the Thapsia silphium, and to %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 15.] LASEEPITIUM, LASER, AND MASPETUM. 145 %0a%3c %0a%3c markable plant, known to the Greeks by the name of “ sil- %0a%3c phion,” and originally a native of the province of Cyrenaica. %0a%3c The juice of this plant is called “laser,” and it is greatly in %0a%3c vogue for medicinal as well as other purposes, being sold at %0a%3c the same rate as silver. For these many years past, however, %0a%3c it has not been found in Cyrenaica,®® as the farmers of the %0a%3c revenue who hold the lands there on lease, have a notion that %0a%3c it is more profitable to depasture flocks of sheep upon them. %0a%3c Within the memory of the present generation, a single stalk®’ %0a%3c is all that has ever been found there, and that was sent as a %0a%3c curiosity to the Emperor Nero. If it so happen that one of %0a%3c the flock, while grazing, meets with a growing shoot®® of it, the %0a%3c fact is easily ascertained by the following signs; the sheep, after %0a%3c eating of it, immediately falls asleep, while the goat is seized %0a%3c with a fit of sneezing.®® For this long time past, there has %0a%3c been no other laser imported into this country, but that pro¬ %0a%3c duced in either Persis, Media, or Armenia, where it grows in %0a%3c considerable abundance, though much inferior®® to that of Cy¬ %0a%3c renaica ; and even then it is extensively adulterated with gum, %0a%3c sacopenium,®* or pounded beans. I ought the less then to %0a%3c %0a%3c reject the raore general opinion that it is identical with the Fernla asa- %0a%3c foetida. Pliny has prohahly caused some confusion by blending the de¬ %0a%3c scription of other writers with that given by Theophrastus, each having %0a%3c in view a different plant. Indeed, whatever the Laserpitium or Silphiura %0a%3c of other countries may have been, it is not improbable that the odoriferous %0a%3c plant of Cyrenaica was not identical with the Ferula asafoetidaof Linnaeus. %0a%3c The foliage of the Thapsia silphium is exactly similar to that of the %0a%3c Laserpitium as depicted on medals of Cyrenaica, still extant. We learn %0a%3c from Littre, that Dr. Guyon showed, in 1842, to the Academie des %0a%3c Sciences, a plant which the Ai-abs of Algeria employ as a purgative, and %0a%3c which they call bonnefa. It is the Thapsia Garganica of Desfontaines, %0a%3c and is considered by Guyon to he identical with the Silphium of the %0a%3c ancients. %0a%3c %0a%3c ** See B. xxii. c. 48. In the “ Rudens” of Plautus, the scene of which is %0a%3c near Cyrene, frequent allusion is made to the growth of laserpitium there, %0a%3c and the preparation and export of the resin, as forming the staple article %0a%3c of commerce. %0a%3c %0a%3c Scribonius Largus, who lived in the time of Tiberius, speaks of using %0a%3c in a prescription laser of Cyrenaica, “ if it can be met with“ si poterit %0a%3c inveniri.” ®® “ In spem nascentis.” %0a%3c %0a%3c Fee remarks that Pliny has not found this absurd story in any of the %0a%3c works from which he has compiled his account, but that h is entirely his %0a%3c own. %0a%3c %0a%3c ®® This was probably the Ferula asafcetida of Linnaeus. %0a%3c %0a%3c ** See B.

This took place seven j'ears before %0a%3c the foundation of the city of Cyren®, and in the year of Rome %0a%3c 143. The virtues of this remarkable fall of rain extended, %0a%3c it is said, over no less than four thousand stadia of the African %0a%3c territorj'; and upon this soil laserpitium began universally to %0a%3c grow, a plant that is in general wild and stubborn, and which, %0a%3c if attempted to be cultivated, will leave the spot where it has %0a%3c been sown quite desolate and barren. The roots of it are %0a%3c numerous and thick, the stalk being like that of fennel-giant, %0a%3c and of similar thickness. The leaves of this plant were known %0a%3c as “maspetum,” and bore a considerable resemblance to parsley; %0a%3c the seeds of it were foliaceous, and the plant shed its leaves %0a%3c every year. They used to feed the cattle there upon it; at %0a%3c first it purged them, but afterwards they would grow fat, the %0a%3c flesh being improved in flavour in a most surprising degree. %0a%3c After the fall of the leaf, the people themselves were in the %0a%3c habit of eating ®* the stalk, either roasted or boiled : from the %0a%3c drastic effects of this diet the body was purged for the first %0a%3c forty days, all vicious humours being effectually removed.®’ %0a%3c The juices of this plant were collected two different ways, %0a%3c either from the root or from the stalk ; in consequence of which %0a%3c these two varieties of the juice were known by the distinguish¬ %0a%3c ing names of “rhizias” and “ eaulias,”®® the last being of in¬ %0a%3c ferior quality to the other, and very apt to turn putrid.

B vi. c. 3, he has mistaken his meaning. %0a%3c %0a%3c This, as Fee says, could hardly apply to the Ferula asafoetida of %0a%3c Linnaeus, the stalk of it being extremely acrid, and the j uice fetid in tho %0a%3c highest degree. %0a%3c %0a%3c “ Vitia his omnibus.” The reading here is probably corrupt. %0a%3c %0a%3c ®® “Root-juice,” and “stalk-juice.” %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 16.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c MAQTDAniS. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 117 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c the root there was a black bark, which was extensively em¬ %0a%3c ployed for the purposes of adulteration. The juice of the %0a%3c plant was received in vessels, and mixed there with a layer of %0a%3c bran ; after which, from time to time it was shaken, till it had %0a%3c reached a proper state of maturity; indeed, if this precaution %0a%3c was neglected, it was apt to turn putrid. The signs that it %0a%3c had come to maturity were its colour, its dryness, and the ab¬ %0a%3c sorption of all humidity. %0a%3c %0a%3c There are some authors, however, who state that the root of %0a%3c laserpitiuro was more than a cubit in length, and that it pre¬ %0a%3c sented a tuberosity above the surface of the earth. An incision, %0a%3c they say, was made in this tuberosity, from which a juice would %0a%3c flow, like milk in appearance; above the tuberosity grew a %0a%3c stalk, to which they give the name of “ magydaris the %0a%3c leaves that grew upon this stalk were of the colour of gold, and, %0a%3c falling at the rising of the Dog-star, when the south winds %0a%3c begin to prevail, they acted as seed for the purposes of repro¬ %0a%3c duction. It was from these leaves, too, they say, that laser- %0a%3c pitium was produced, the root and the stalk attaining their %0a%3c full growth in the space of one year. The same writers also %0a%3c state, that it was the practice to turn up the ground about the %0a%3c plant, and that it had no such effect as purging the cattle that %0a%3c were fed upon it; though one result of using it as food was, %0a%3c that such cattle as were ailing were either cured of their dis¬ %0a%3c tempers, or else died immediately upon eating of it, a thing, %0a%3c however, that but rarely happened.

Linnaeus has “pretended,” he says, that the Spaniards %0a%3c still employ the root and stalk of the Gypsophila for the same purposes as %0a%3c the ancients did the same parts of the Eadicula. He himself, however, %0a%3c though long resident in Spain, had never observed such to be tbe fact. %0a%3c %0a%3c This description.

When the cucumber acquires a %0a%3c very considerable volume, it is known to us as the “pepo.”®^ %0a%3c Cucumbers when eaten remain on the stomach till the follow¬ %0a%3c ing day, and are very difficult®® of digestion; still, for all that, %0a%3c in general they are not considered very unwholesome. By %0a%3c nature they have a wonderful hatred to oil, and no less aflfec- %0a%3c tion for water, and this after they have been cut from the stem %0a%3c even.®® If water is within a moderate distance of them, they %0a%3c will creep towards it, while from oil, on the other hand, they %0a%3c M'ill shrink away : if any obstacle, too, should happen to arrest %0a%3c their progress, or if they are left to hang, they will grow %0a%3c curved and crooked. Of these facts we may be satisfactorily %0a%3c convinced in a single night even, for if a vessel filled with %0a%3c water is placed at four fingers’ distance from a cucumber, it %0a%3c will be found to have descended to it by the following morn¬ %0a%3c ing ; but if the same is done with oil, it will have assumed the %0a%3c curved form of a hook by the next day. If hung in a tube %0a%3c while in blossom, the cucumber will grow to a most surprising %0a%3c %0a%3c ®® Theophrastus and Columella say the same of the cucumber, and %0a%3c Palladius of the melon, but there is no ground, probably, for the belief, lu %0a%3c very recent times, however. Fee says, it was the usage to steep the seeds of the %0a%3c melon in milk.

A thing that is very remarkable in them, in %0a%3c addition to their shape, colour, and smell, is the fact that, %0a%3c when ripe, although they do not hang from the stem, they %0a%3c separate from it at the stalk. %0a%3c %0a%3c Columella®* has given us a plan of his, by which we may %0a%3c have cucumbers the whole year round: the largest bramble- %0a%3c bush that can be procured is transplanted to a warm, sunny %0a%3c spot, and then cut down, about the time of the vernal equinox, %0a%3c to within a couple of fingers of the ground; a cucumber-seed %0a%3c is then inserted in the pith of the bramble, and the roots are %0a%3c well moulded up with fine earth and manure, to withstand the %0a%3c cold. According to the Greeks, there are three kinds of cu¬ %0a%3c cumbers, the Laconian, the Scytalic, and the Boeotian,®* the %0a%3c Laconian being the only one among them that is fond ®* of the %0a%3c water. %0a%3c %0a%3c There are some persons who recommend steeping the seed of %0a%3c the cucumber in the juice of the herb known as the “ culix;”®* %0a%3c the produce, they say, will be sure to grow without seeds. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 24. —GOTJEDS. %0a%3c %0a%3c Gourds resemble the cucumber in nature, at least in their %0a%3c manner of growing; they manifest an equal aversion to the %0a%3c winter, too, while they require constant watering and manure. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is conformable Avith modem experience. %0a%3c %0a%3c Fee says that this is the melon, the Cucumis melo of Linnaeus. %0a%3c %0a%3c B. xi. c. 3.

Of %0a%3c course there is no truth in the story here told of the effects of its juice %0a%3c upon the cucumber. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Uhap. 24.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c G0UED8. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 159 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Both cucumbers and gourds are sown in holes a foot and %0a%3c a half® deep, between the vernal equinox and the summer sol¬ %0a%3c stice, at the time of the Parilia ^ more particularly. Some per¬ %0a%3c sons, however, think it better to sow gourds after the calends %0a%3c of March,®® and cucumbers after the nones,®® and at the time of %0a%3c the Quinquatria.’® The cucumber and the gourd climb up¬ %0a%3c wards in a precisely similar manner, their shoots creeping along %0a%3c the rough surface of the walls, even to the very roof, so great %0a%3c is their fondness for elevated spots. They have not suflScient %0a%3c strength, however, to support themselves without the aid of %0a%3c stays. Shooting upwards with the greatest rapidity, they soon %0a%3c cover with their light shade the arched roofs of the houses and %0a%3c the trellises on which they are trained. From this circum¬ %0a%3c stance it is that we find the gourd classified into two primary %0a%3c kinds, the roof-gourd,’^ and the common gourd, which creeps %0a%3c upon the ground. In the first kind, from a stalk of remark¬ %0a%3c able thinness is suspended a fruit of considerable weight and %0a%3c volume, and quite immoveable by the action of the wind. The %0a%3c gourd, too, as well as the cucumber, admits of being lengthened %0a%3c to any extent, by the aid of osier tubes more particularly. Just %0a%3c after the blossom has fallen off, the plant is introduced into %0a%3c these tubes, and as it grows it can be made to assume any form %0a%3c that may be wished, that of a serpent coiled up being the one %0a%3c that is mostly preferred; if left at liberty to grow as it hangs, %0a%3c it has been known before now to attain to no less than nine %0a%3c feet in length. %0a%3c %0a%3c The cucumber flowers gradually, blossom succeeding blos¬ %0a%3c som ; and it adapts itself perfectly well to a diy soil. It is %0a%3c %0a%3c ®® This depth would probably have the effect of retarding, or else utterly %0a%3c impeding, the growth of the plant. %0a%3c %0a%3c See c. 44 of this Book.

Bauhiii, the long gourd, and %0a%3c other varieties probably of the calabash gourd, the Cucurbita leucantha of %0a%3c Duchesne. The latter is probably the Cucurbita pepo and its varieties. %0a%3c J'ee thinks that the name “ cucurbita,” as employed by Pliny, extends ’ %0a%3c not only to the gourd, but the citrul or small pumpkin as well. %0a%3c %0a%3c As Fee says, he must be speaking of the fruit here, and not tlie %0a%3c plant, which attains a far greater length than nine feet. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 160 Pliny’s natural history. [Hook XIX. %0a%3c %0a%3c covered with a white down, which increases in quantity as the %0a%3c plant gains in size. %0a%3c %0a%3c The gourd admits of being applied to more numerous uses %0a%3c than the cucumber even : the stem is used as an article of %0a%3c food” when young, but at a later period it changes its nature, %0a%3c and its qualities become totally different: of late, gourds have %0a%3c come to be used in baths for jugs and pitchers, but for this %0a%3c long time past they have been employed as casks” for keeping %0a%3c wine. The rind is tender while the fruit is green, but still it %0a%3c is always scraped off when the gourd is used for food. It ad¬ %0a%3c mits of being eaten several ways, and forms a light and whole¬ %0a%3c some aliment, and this although it is one of those fruits that %0a%3c are difficult of digestion bj'^ the human stomach, and are apt to %0a%3c swell out those who eat of them. The seeds which lie nearest %0a%3c to the neck of the gourd produce fruit of remarkable ” length, %0a%3c and so do those which lie at the lower extremities, though not %0a%3c at all comparable with the others. Those, on the other hand, %0a%3c which lie in the middle, produce gourds of a round shape, and %0a%3c those on the sides fruit that are thick and short. The seeds %0a%3c are dried by being placed in the shade, and when wanted for %0a%3c sowing, are steeped in water first. The longer and thinner the %0a%3c gourd is, the more agreeable it is to the palate, and hence it is %0a%3c that those which have been left to grow hanging are reckoned %0a%3c the most wholesome: these, too, have fewer seeds than the %0a%3c others, the hardness of which is apt to render the fruit less %0a%3c agreeable for eating. %0a%3c %0a%3c Those which are intended for keeping seed, are usually not cut %0a%3c before the winter sets in; they are then dried in the smoke, %0a%3c and are extensively employed for preserving” garden seeds, and %0a%3c for making other articles for domestic use. There has been a %0a%3c method discovered, also, of preserving the gourd for table, and %0a%3c the cucumber as well, till nearly the time when the next year’s %0a%3c crop is ripe; this is done by putting them in brine. We are %0a%3c assured, too, that if put in a hole dug in a place well shaded %0a%3c %0a%3c The young shoots of the gourd, Fee says, would afford an insipid %0a%3c food, with but little nutriment. %0a%3c %0a%3c The varieties thus employed. Fee says, must have been the Cucurbita %0a%3c lagenaria of Linnaeus, and the Cucurbita latior of Dodonaeus. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is not the fact. The seed produces fruit similar to that from %0a%3c which it was taken, and no more. %0a%3c %0a%3c The trumpet gourd, the Cucurbita longior of Dodonaeus, is still em¬ %0a%3c ployed, Fee says, by gardeners fol this purpose. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 25.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c RAPB : TURXIPS. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c IGl %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c from tlie sun, with a laj’er of sand beneath, and dry liay and %0a%3c earth on the top of them, thej'^ may be kept green for a very %0a%3c long time.

This plant is remarkable for its %0a%3c pungency, which increases in proportion to the thickness of the %0a%3c rind: in some cases, too, the surface#of it assumes a ligneous %0a%3c nature. Radishes are flatulent®® to a remarkable degree, and %0a%3c are productive of eructations ; hence it is that they are looked %0a%3c upon as an aliment only fit for low-bred people,®* and this %0a%3c more particularly if colcworts are eaten directly after them. %0a%3c If, on the other hand, they are eaten with green olives, the %0a%3c eructations produced are not so frequent, and less offensive. %0a%3c In Egypt the radish is held in very high esteem, on account %0a%3c of the abundance of oil®^ that is extracted from the seed. In- %0a%3c %0a%3c Radish. Properly radish. %0a%3c %0a%3c See B. XX. c. 49. Fee queries whether this radish may not be tlie %0a%3c Eaphanus raphanistrum of botanists.

The variety %0a%3c Oleifera of the Brassica napus is also greatly cultivated in Egypt. Fee %0a%3c suggests that Pliny may possibly confound these two plants under the one %0a%3c name of “ raphanus.” It is worthy of remark, too, that the Colza oil, so %0a%3c much used in France and Belgium for burning in lamps, is expressed from %0a%3c the seed of the Brassica olcracea, a species of cabbage. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Cbap. 26.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c EADISHES. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 163 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c deed, the people of that country sow this plant in preference %0a%3c to any other, whenever they can get the opportunity, the profits %0a%3c derived from it being larger than those obtained from the culti¬ %0a%3c vation of corn, and the imposts levied upon it considerably less : %0a%3c there is no grain known that yields a larger quantity of oil. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Greeks have distinguished the radish^ into three dif¬ %0a%3c ferent kinds, according to the characteristic features of the %0a%3c leaves, there being the crisped leaf, the smooth leaf, and the %0a%3c wild radish, the leaf of which is smooth, but shorter than that %0a%3c of the others ; it is round also, grows in great abundance, and %0a%3c spreads like a shrub. The taste of this last variety is acrid, %0a%3c and it acts medicinally as a strong purgative. In the first kind, %0a%3c again, there are certain differences, determined by the seed, for %0a%3c in some varieties the seed is of an inferior quality, and in others %0a%3c remarkably small: these defects, however, are only found to %0a%3c exist in the kind that has the crisped leaf. %0a%3c %0a%3c Our own people, again, have found other varieties of the %0a%3c radish : there is the Algidan radish, long and transparent, so %0a%3c called from the place of its growth: another, similar to the %0a%3c rape in form, is known as the Syrian radish; it is pretty %0a%3c nearly the mildest and the most tender of them all, and is well %0a%3c able to bear the winter. The very best of all, however, is the %0a%3c one that has been brought fi’om Syria, very recently it would %0a%3c seem, as we do not find it mentioned by any of our writers: %0a%3c it lasts the whole of the winter through. In addition to these %0a%3c kinds, there is another, a wild variety, known by the Greeks as %0a%3c “agrion,”®® and to the people of Pontus as “ armon,” while %0a%3c others, again, call it “ leuce,“® and our people “ armoracia %0a%3c it has more leaves, however, than root. %0a%3c %0a%3c In testing the quality of the radish, it is the stem more par- %0a%3c %0a%3c The Eaphanus sativus of Linnaeus.

Aristomachus recommends the leaves to be taken %0a%3c off in winter, and the roots to he well moulded up, to prevent %0a%3c the water from accumulating about them; and he says, that %0a%3c by using these precautions, they will be all the finer in summer. %0a%3c Borne authors have mentioned a plan of making a hole with a %0a%3c dibble, and covering it at the bottom wdth a layer of chaff, six %0a%3c fingers in depth; upon this layer the seed is put, and then %0a%3c covered over with manure and earth ; the result of which is, %0a%3c according to their statement, that radishes are obtained full as %0a%3c large as the hole so made. It is salt, however, that conduces %0a%3c more particularly to their nutriment, and hence it is that they are %0a%3c often watered with brine ; in Egypt, too, the growers sprinkle %0a%3c nitre ’ over them, the roots being remarkable for their mildness %0a%3c The salt, too, has the similar effect of removing all their pun- %0a%3c gency, and when thus treated, they become very similar in %0a%3c their qualities to radishes that have been boiled: for when %0a%3c boiled they become sweet and mild, and eat, in fact, just like %0a%3c turnips. %0a%3c %0a%3c Fee suggests that he is here speaking of the heet-root, in reality a %0a%3c native of the north of Europe. %0a%3c %0a%3c Thirteenth of February. %0a%3c %0a%3c * The festival of Vulcan, beginning on the twenty-third of August, and %0a%3c lasting eight days. %0a%3c %0a%3c - A natural production, the carbonate of sodium of the chemists, kno\ni %0a%3c from time immemorial by the name of “natron.” See B. xxx. c. 46; %0a%3c from which passage it would appear that it w'as generally employed for %0a%3c watering the leguminous plants. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 27.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c PARSNIPS. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 165 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Medical men recommend raw radishes to be eaten fasting, %0a%3c with salt, for the purpose ® of collecting the crude humours of %0a%3c the viscera ; and in this way they prepare them for the action %0a%3c of emetics.

The parsnip begins %0a%3c to be fit for eating at the end of a year, but it is still better at %0a%3c the end of two: it is reckoned more agreeable eating in autumn, %0a%3c and more particularly if cooked in the saucepan ; even then, %0a%3c however, it preserves its strong pungent flavour, which it is %0a%3c found quite impossible to get rid of. %0a%3c %0a%3c The hibiscum® differs from the parsnip in being more slender: %0a%3c it is rejected as a food, but is found useful for its medicinal %0a%3c properties.

There are two varieties of it employed in medi¬ %0a%3c cine, the male squill, which has white leaves, and the female %0a%3c squill, with black®® ones. There is a third kind also, which is %0a%3c good to eat, and is known as the Epimenidian®^ squill; the leaf %0a%3c is narrow'^er than in the other kinds, and not so rough. All %0a%3c the squills have numerous seeds, but they come up much more %0a%3c quickly if propagated from the oflsets that grow on the sides. %0a%3c To make them attain a still greater size, the large leaves that %0a%3c grow around them are turned down and covered over with %0a%3c earth; by which method all the juices are carried to the %0a%3c heads.

It is a sign that they are ripe when %0a%3c the leaves become dry at the lower extremities. When too %0a%3c old they are held in disesteem; the same, too, with the long %0a%3c and the smaller ones; those, on the other hand, which are red %0a%3c and round are greatly preferred, as also those of the largest %0a%3c size.

The root of the wild %0a%3c kind is smaller and of a humid nature, and when up it will %0a%3c keep alive for a considerable period. In some of these plants, %0a%3c however, the roots are fibrous, as we find the case in parsley %0a%3c and mallows, for instance; in others, again, they are of a %0a%3c ligneous nature, as in ocimum, for example ; and in others they %0a%3c are fleshy, as in beet, and in saffron even more so. In some, %0a%3c again, the root is composed of rind and flesh, as in the radish %0a%3c and the rape ; while in others it is jointed, as in hay grass.“ %0a%3c Those plants which have not a straight root throw out imme¬ %0a%3c diately a great number of hairy fibres, orage^® and blite,^® for %0a%3c instance: squills again, bulbs, onions, and garlic never have %0a%3c any but a vertical root.

Taking %0a%3c the hint from this fact, it is recommended to strip the other %0a%3c kinds of their leaves, to make them bulb all the better, instead %0a%3c of running to seed. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Ascalonian onion is of a peculiar nature, being barren %0a%3c in some measure in the root; hence it is that the Greeks have %0a%3c recommended it to be reproduced from seed, and not from roots: %0a%3c the transplanting, too, they say, should be done later in the %0a%3c spring, at the time the plant germinates, the result being that %0a%3c it bulbs with all the greater rapidity, and hastens, as it were, %0a%3c to make up for lost time ; great dispatch, however, is requisite %0a%3c in taking it up, for when ripe it rots with the greatest rapi¬ %0a%3c dity. If propagated from roots, it throws out a long stalk, %0a%3c runs rapidly to seed, and dies. %0a%3c %0a%3c There are considerable differences, too, in the colour of the %0a%3c onion ; the whitest of all are those grown at Issue and Sardes. %0a%3c The onions, too, of Crete are held in high esteem, but there %0a%3c is some doubt whether they are not the same as the Ascalonian %0a%3c variety; for when grown from seed they produce a fine bulb, %0a%3c but when planted they throw out a long stalk and run to seed; %0a%3c in fact, they differ from the Ascalonian kind only in the sweet¬ %0a%3c ness of their flavour. %0a%3c %0a%3c Among us there are two principal varieties known of the %0a%3c onion ; the scallion, employed for seasonings, is one, known to %0a%3c the Greeks by the name of “ gethyon,” and by us as the “pal- %0a%3c lacanait is sown in March, April, and Maj^ The other %0a%3c kind is the bulbed or headed®® onion; it is sown just after the %0a%3c autumnal equinox, or else after the west winds have begun to %0a%3c prevail. The varieties of this last kind, ranged according to %0a%3c their relative degrees of pungency, are the African onion, the %0a%3c Gallic, the Tusculan, the Ascalonian, and the Amitemian: the %0a%3c roundest in shape are the best. The red onion, too, is more %0a%3c pungent than the white, the stored than the fresh, the raw %0a%3c than the cooked, and the dried than the preserved. The onion %0a%3c of Amiternum is cultivated in cold, humid localities, and is %0a%3c the only one that is reproduced from heads,®® like garlic, the %0a%3c other kinds being grown from seed. This last kind yields no %0a%3c %0a%3c “Capitata.” %0a%3c %0a%3c For this reason, Fee is inclined to resard it as a variety either of %0a%3c garlic, Allium sativum, or of the chalotte, Allium Ascalonicum of Liuuie is. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 33.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c TKE LEEK. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 173 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c seed in the ensuing summer, but a bulb only, which dries and %0a%3c keeps; but in the summer after, the contrary is the case, for %0a%3c seed is produced, while the bulb very quickly spoils. Hence %0a%3c it is that every year there are two separate sowings, one of %0a%3c seed for the reproduction of bulbs, and one of bulbs for the %0a%3c growth of seed; these onions keep best in chaff. The scallion %0a%3c has hardly any bulb at aU, but a long neck only—hence it is %0a%3c nothing but leaf, and is often cut down, like the leek ; for this %0a%3c reason, too, like the leek, it is grown from seed, and not from %0a%3c plants. %0a%3c %0a%3c In addition to these particulars, it is recommended that the %0a%3c ground intended for sowing onions should be turned up three %0a%3c times, care being taken to remove all roots and weeds; ten %0a%3c pounds of seed is the proper proportion for a jugerum. Savory ’ %0a%3c too, they say, should be mixed with them, the onions being all %0a%3c the finer for it; the ground, too, should be stubbed and hoed %0a%3c four times at least, if not oftener. In Italy, the Ascalonian %0a%3c onion is sown in the month of February.

Leeks are reproduced from %0a%3c seed, sown just after the autumnal equinox; if they are in¬ %0a%3c tended for cutting,®® the seed is sown thicker than otherwise. %0a%3c The leeks in the same bed are cut repeatedly, till it is quite ex¬ %0a%3c hausted, and they are alw'ays kept well manured.

It %0a%3c is doubtful, however, whether its mucilage has any beneficial effect upon %0a%3c the voice. See B. xx. c. 21. %0a%3c %0a%3c ®® Fee says, that it is a practice with many gardeners, more harmful %0a%3c than beneficial, to cut the leaves of the leek as it grows, their object being %0a%3c to increase the size of the stalk. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 174 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c pliny’s natural history. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XIX. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c wanted to bulb before being cut, when they have grown to %0a%3c some size they are transplanted to another bed, the extremities %0a%3c of the leaves being snipped off without touching the white part, %0a%3c and the heads stripped of the outer coats. The ancients were %0a%3c in the habit of placing a stone or potsherd upon the leek, to %0a%3c make the head grow all the larger, and the same with the %0a%3c bulbs as well; but at the present day it is the usual practice %0a%3c to move the fibrous roots gently with the weeding-hook, so that %0a%3c by being bent they may nourish the plant, and not withdraw %0a%3c the juices from it. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is a remarkable fact, that, though the leek stands in need %0a%3c of manure and a rich soil, it has a particular aversion to water; %0a%3c and yet its nature depends very much upon the natural proper¬ %0a%3c ties of the soil. The most esteemed leeks are those grown in %0a%3c Egypt, and next to them those of Ostia and Aricia.®^ Of the %0a%3c leek for cutting, there are two varieties: that with grass- %0a%3c green leaves and incisions distinctly traced on them, and the %0a%3c leek vith paler and rounder leaves, the incisions being more %0a%3c lightly marked. There is a story told, that Mela,“ a member %0a%3c of the Equestrian order, being accused of mal-administration %0a%3c by order of the Emperor Tiberius, swallowed in his despair %0a%3c leek-juice to the amount of three denarii in weight of silver, %0a%3c and expired upon the spot without the slightest symptom of %0a%3c pain.

The flavour of it is pun¬ %0a%3c gent, and the more numerous the cloves the more pungent it %0a%3c is. Like the onion, it imparts an offensive smell to the breath ; %0a%3c but this is not the case when it is cooked. The various species %0a%3c of garlic are distinguished by the periods at which they ripen: %0a%3c the early kind becomes fit for use in sixty days. Another dis¬ %0a%3c tinction, too, is formed by the relative size of the heads. Ulpi- %0a%3c cum,'® also, generally known to the Greeks as Cyprian garlic,” %0a%3c belongs to this class; by some persons it is called “ antisco- %0a%3c rodon,” and in Africa more particularly it holds a high rank %0a%3c among the dishes of the rural population ; it is of a larger size %0a%3c than ordinary garlic. When beaten up with oil and vinegar, %0a%3c it is quite surprising what a quantity of creaming foam is pro¬ %0a%3c duced. %0a%3c %0a%3c There are some persons who recommend that neither ulpicum %0a%3c nor garlic should be sown on level ground, but say that they %0a%3c should be planted in little mounds trenched up, at a distance of %0a%3c three feet apart. Between each clove, they say, there should %0a%3c be a distance of four fingers left, and as soon as ever three %0a%3c leaves are visible, the heads should be hoed; the oftener they %0a%3c are hoed, the larger the size they will attain. When they %0a%3c begin to ripen, the stalks are bent downwards, and covered %0a%3c over with earth, a precaution which effectually prevents them %0a%3c from running to leaf. In cold soils, it is considered better to %0a%3c plant them in spring than in autumn. %0a%3c %0a%3c For the purpose of depriving all these plants of their strong %0a%3c smell, it is recommended to set them when the moon is below %0a%3c the horizon, and to take them up Avhen she is in conjunction. %0a%3c Independently of these precautions, we find Menander, one %0a%3c of the Greek writers, recommending those who haA'e been %0a%3c outing garlic to eat immediately afterwards a root of beet %0a%3c %0a%3c serpents; and though persons who had just eaten of it were not allowed to %0a%3c enter the Temple of the Mother of tlie Gods, it was prescribed to those %0a%3c who wished to be purified and ab.solved from crimes. It is still held in %0a%3c considerable esteem in the south of Europe, where, by the lower classes, %0a%3c great medicinal virtues are ascribed to it. %0a%3c %0a%3c Theophrastus says, Hist. Plant.

Some persons are of %0a%3c opinion, that the proper period for planting garlic and ulpicum %0a%3c is between the festival of the Compitalia’^ and that of the %0a%3c Saturnalia.'^ Garlic, too, can be grown from seed, but it is %0a%3c very slow, in such case, in coming to maturity ; for in the first %0a%3c year, the head attains the size only of that of a leek, in the %0a%3c second, it separates into cloves, and only in the third it arrives %0a%3c at maturity ; there are some, however, who think that garlic %0a%3c grown this way is the best. Garlic should never be allowed %0a%3c to run to seed, but the stalk should be twisted, to promote its %0a%3c growth, and to make the head attain a larger size. %0a%3c %0a%3c If garlic or onions are wanted to keep some time, the heads %0a%3c should be dipped in salt water, made luke-warm; by doing %0a%3c this, they will be all the better for keeping, though quite %0a%3c worthless for reproduction. Some persons content themselves %0a%3c with hanging them over burning coals, and are of opinion that %0a%3c this is quite sufficient to prevent them from sprouting : for it %0a%3c is a well-known fact, that both garlic and onions sprout when %0a%3c out of the ground, and that after throwing out their thin shoots %0a%3c they shrivel away to nothing. Some persons are of opinion, %0a%3c too, that the best way of keeping garlic is by storing it in chaff. %0a%3c There is a kindof garlic that grows spontaneously in tho %0a%3c fields, and is known by the name of “ alum.” To preserve %0a%3c the seeds that are sown there from the remorseless ravages of %0a%3c the birds, tfiis plant is scattered over the ground, being first %0a%3c boiled, to prevent it from shooting.

Anise, again, comes up on the fourth day, the %0a%3c lettuce on the fifth, the radish on the sixth, the cucumber and %0a%3c the gourd on the seventh—the cucumber rather the first of the %0a%3c two—cresses and mustard on the fifth, beet on the sixth day %0a%3c in summer and the tenth in winter, orage on the eighth, onions %0a%3c on the nineteenth or twentieth, and scallions on the tenth %0a%3c or twelfth. Coriander, again, is more stubborn in its growth, %0a%3c cunila and wild marjoram do not appear till after the thirtieth %0a%3c day, and parsley comes up with the greatest difficulty of all, %0a%3c for at the very earliest it is forty days before it shows itself, %0a%3c and in most instances as much as fifty. %0a%3c %0a%3c The age,” too, of the seed is of some importance in this re¬ %0a%3c spect ; for fresh seed comes up more rapidly in the case of the %0a%3c leek, the scallion, the cucumber, and the gourd, while in that %0a%3c of parsley, beet, cardamum, cunila, wild marjoram, and co¬ %0a%3c riander, seed that has been kept for some time is the best. %0a%3c %0a%3c There is one remarkable circumstance in connection with %0a%3c the seed of beet; it does not all germinate in the first year, but %0a%3c some of it in the second, and some in the third even ; hence %0a%3c it is that a considerable quantity of seed produces only a very %0a%3c moderate crop. Some plants produce only in the year in which %0a%3c they are set, and some, again, for successive years, parsley, %0a%3c leelis, and scallions’® for instance ; indeed, these plants, when %0a%3c once sown, retain their fertility, and produce for many years. %0a%3c %0a%3c The whole nearly of this Chapter is borrowed from Theophrastus, %0a%3c Hist.

There are differences, %0a%3c also, in the colour of seeds, which is either black or white; %0a%3c while some seeds are woody and hard, in radishes, mustard, %0a%3c and rape, the seeds are enclosed in pods. In parsley, corian- %0a%3c der, anise, fennel, and cummin, the seed has no covering at all, %0a%3c while in blite, beet, orage, and ocimum, it has an outer coat, %0a%3c and in the lettuce it is covered with a fine down. There is no %0a%3c seed more prolific than that of ocimum it is generally re¬ %0a%3c commended®^ to sow it with the utterance of curses and im¬ %0a%3c precations, the result being that it grows all the better for it; %0a%3c the earth, too, is rammed down when it is sown, and prayers %0a%3c offered that the seed may never come up. The seeds which are %0a%3c enveloped in an outer coat, are dried with considerable diffi¬ %0a%3c culty, that of ocimum more particularly; hence it is that all %0a%3c these seeds are dried artificially, their fruitfulness being greatly %0a%3c promoted thereby. %0a%3c %0a%3c Plants in general come up better when the seed is sown in %0a%3c heaps than when it is scattered broad-cast: leeks, in fact, and %0a%3c parsley are generally grown by sowing the seed in little bags %0a%3c in the case of parsley, too, a hole is made with the dibble, and a %0a%3c layer of manure inserted. %0a%3c %0a%3c All garden plants grow either from seed or from slips, and %0a%3c some from both seed and suckers, such as rue, wild marjoram, %0a%3c and ocimum,®® for example—this last being usually cut when %0a%3c it is a palm in height. Some kinds, again, are reproduced %0a%3c from both seed and root, as in the case of onions, garlic, and %0a%3c bulbs, and those other plants of which, though annuals them¬ %0a%3c selves, the roots retain their vitality. In those plants which %0a%3c grow from the root, it lives for a considerable time, and throws %0a%3c out offsets, as in bulbs, scallions, and squills for example.— %0a%3c %0a%3c Fee says that basil, the Ocimum basilicum of Linnaeus, is not meant %0a%3c here, nor yet the leguminous plant that was known to the Romans by that %0a%3c name. %0a%3c %0a%3c A singular superstition truly! Theophrastus says the same in rela¬ %0a%3c tion to cummin seed. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is not done at the present day. %0a%3c %0a%3c ®® This can hardly be our basil, the Ocimum basilicum, for that plant is %0a%3c an annual. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. .37.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c DIFFERENT KINDS OF PLANTS. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 179 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Others, again, throw out offsets, though not from a bulbous %0a%3c root, such as parsley and beet, for instance. When the stalk %0a%3c is cut, with the exception of those which have not a rough %0a%3c stem, nearly all these plants put forth fresh shoots, a thing that %0a%3c may be seen in ocimum,“ the radish,®® and the lettuce,®’ which %0a%3c are in daily use among us; indeed, it is generally thought that %0a%3c the lettuce which is grown from a fresh sprouting, is the %0a%3c sweetest. The radish, too, is more pleasant eating when the %0a%3c leaves have been removed before it has begun to run to stalk. %0a%3c The same is the case, too, with rape; for when the leaves are %0a%3c taken off, and the roots well covered up with earth, it grows %0a%3c all the larger for it, and keeps in good preservation till the en¬ %0a%3c suing summer. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 37.- PLANTS OF WHICH THEBE IS BUT A SINGLE KIND. %0a%3c %0a%3c PLANTS OF WHICH THEBE ABE SEVERAL KINDS. %0a%3c %0a%3c Of ocimum, lapathum, blite, cresses, rocket, orage, coriander, %0a%3c and anise respectively, there is but a single kind, these plants %0a%3c being the same everywhere, and no better in one place than %0a%3c in another.

THE LETTUCE ; ITS DIFFERENT VARIETIES. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Greeks have distinguished three varieties of the lettuce %0a%3c the first with a stalk so large, that small garden gates,®’ it is %0a%3c said, have been made of it: the leaf of this lettuce is some- %0a%3c ■what larger than that of the herbaceous, or green lettuce, but %0a%3c extremely narrow, the nutriment seeming to be expended on %0a%3c the other parts of the plant. The second kind is that with a %0a%3c rounded®® stalk; and the third is the low, squat lettuce,®*gene¬ %0a%3c rally known as the Laconian lettuce. %0a%3c %0a%3c “ thinly covered with leaves,” and not iiov6(pvW‘'v, “ having a single %0a%3c leaf.” Palladius (iw translates it, “ molli folio,” “with a soft %0a%3c %0a%3c leaf;” hut, though Fte commends this version, it is not correct. %0a%3c %0a%3c Or “horse-parsley.” Hardouin takes this to he Macedonian parsley, %0a%3c the Buhon Macedonicum of Linnaeus. Fee, following C. Bauhin and %0a%3c Sprengel, is inclined to identify it with Macerona, the Smyrnium olusa- %0a%3c trum of Linnaeus. %0a%3c %0a%3c Or “mountain-parsley.” Probably the Athamanta oreoselinum of %0a%3c ' Linnaeus. Some commentators, however, take it to be the Laserpitium %0a%3c formosum of Wilidenow. Sprengel identifies it with the Selinum oreose¬ %0a%3c linum of Linnaeus. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Apium petroselinum, probably, of Linnaeus. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Lactuca sativa of Linnaeus, This account of the Greek varieties %0a%3c is from Theophrastus, Hist.

Those, again, who %0a%3c have pursued these enquiries even further than this, have dis¬ %0a%3c tinguished a still greater number of varieties of them—the %0a%3c purple, the crisped, the Cappadocian,® and the Greek lettuce, %0a%3c this last having a longer leaf than the rest, and a broad stalk : %0a%3c in addition to which, there is one with a long, narrow leaf, %0a%3c very similar to endive in appearance. The most inferior kind, %0a%3c however, of all, is the one to w^hich the Greeks, censuring it %0a%3c for its bitterness, have given the name of “ picris.”^ There is %0a%3c still another variety, a kind of white lettuce, called “ meconis,”^ %0a%3c a name which it derives from the abundance of milk, of a %0a%3c narcotic quality, which it produces; though, in fact, it is gene¬ %0a%3c rally thought that they are all of them of a soporific tendency. %0a%3c In former times, this last was the only kind of lettuce that %0a%3c was held in any esteem® in Italy, the name “ lactuca ” having %0a%3c been given it on account of the milk ® which it contains. %0a%3c %0a%3c The purple kind, with a very large root, is generally known %0a%3c as the Csecilian ’’ lettuce; while the round one, with an ex¬ %0a%3c tremely diminutive root and broad leaves, is known to some %0a%3c persons as the “astytis,”® and to others as the “ eunychion,” %0a%3c it having the effect, in a remarkable degree, of quenching the %0a%3c amorous propensities. Indeed, they are, all of them, possessed %0a%3c of cooling and refreshing properties, for which reason it is, %0a%3c that they are so highly esteemed in summer; they have the %0a%3c effect, also, of removing from the stomach distaste for food, %0a%3c and of promoting the appetite. At all events, we find it %0a%3c stated, that the late Emperor Augustus, when ill, was saved %0a%3c %0a%3c ^ Columella more particularly.

Lettuces may be sown all the %0a%3c year^® through in a good soil, well-watered and carefull)^ ma¬ %0a%3c nured two months being allowed to intervene between sow¬ %0a%3c ing and transplanting, and two more between transplanting %0a%3c and gathering them when ripe. The rule is, however, to sow %0a%3c them just after the winter solstice, and to transplant Avhen the %0a%3c west winds begin to prevail, or else to sow at this latter period, %0a%3c and to plant out at tlie vernal equinox. The white lettuce is %0a%3c the best adapted for standing the rigours of the winter. %0a%3c %0a%3c All the garden plants are fond of moisture ; lettuces thrive, %0a%3c more particularly, when well manured, and endive even more %0a%3c so. Indeed, it is found an excellent plan to plant them out with %0a%3c the roots covered up in manure, and to keep up the supply, the %0a%3c earth being cleared away for that purpose. Some, again, have %0a%3c another method of increasing their size ; they cut them^^ down %0a%3c when they have reached half a foot in height, and cover them %0a%3c with fresh swine’s dung. It is the general opinion that those %0a%3c lettuces only will admit of being blanched which are produced %0a%3c from white seed; and even then, as soon as they begin to %0a%3c grow, sand from the sea-shore should be spread over them, %0a%3c care being taken to tie the leaves as soon as ever they begin %0a%3c to come to any size. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 40.— BEET : FOTJK VAEIETIES OF IT. %0a%3c %0a%3c Beet“ is the smoothest of all the garden plants. The Greeks %0a%3c distinguish two kinds of beet, according to the colour, the %0a%3c black and the white. The last, which is the kind generally %0a%3c preferred, has but very little seed, and is generally known as %0a%3c the Sicilian^^ beet; just as it is the white lettuce that is held %0a%3c in the highest degree of esteem. Our people, also, distinguish %0a%3c two varieties of beet, the spring and the autumn kinds, so %0a%3c %0a%3c The usual times for sowing the lettuce are before winter and after %0a%3c February. %0a%3c %0a%3c ^ An excess of manure is injurious to the lettuce. %0a%3c %0a%3c •* As already stated in a previous Note (p. 179), lettuces when cut down %0a%3c will not gi-ow again, with the exception of a few worthless lateral branches. %0a%3c %0a%3c From Theophrastus, Hist.

This is a plant, too, that is %0a%3c sometimes transplanted; and it thrives all the better, like the %0a%3c lettuce, if the roots are well covered with manure, in a moist %0a%3c soil. Beet is mostly eaten'*^ with lentils and beans ; it is pre¬ %0a%3c pared also in the same way as cabbage, with mustard more %0a%3c particularly, the pungency of which relieves its insipidity. %0a%3c Medical men are of opinion that beet is a more unwholesome^ %0a%3c vegetable than cabbage; hence it is that I never remember %0a%3c seeing it served at table. Indeed, there are some persons who %0a%3c scruple to taste it even, from a conviction that it is a food %0a%3c suitable only for persons of a robust constitution. %0a%3c %0a%3c Beet is a vegetable with twofold characteristics, partaking %0a%3c of the nature of the cabbage in its leaves and resembling a %0a%3c bulb in the root; that which grows to the greatest breadth %0a%3c being the most highly esteemed. This plant, like the lettuce, %0a%3c is made to grow to head by putting a light weight upon it the %0a%3c moment it begins to assume its proper colour. Indeed, there %0a%3c is no garden plant that grows to a larger head than this, as it %0a%3c sometimes spreads to a couple of feet in breadth, the nature of %0a%3c the soil contributing in a very considerable degree to its size: %0a%3c those found in the territory of Circeii attain the largest size. %0a%3c Some persons'® think that the best time for sowing beet is %0a%3c when the pomegranate is in flower, and are of opinion that it %0a%3c ought to be transplanted as soon as it has thrown out five %0a%3c leaves. There is a singular difference—if indeed it really %0a%3c exists—^between the two varieties of beet, the white kind %0a%3c being remarkable for its purgative qualities, and the black %0a%3c being equally astringent. When wine in the vat has been %0a%3c deteriorated by assuming a flavour like*’ that of cabbage, its %0a%3c original flavour is restored, it is said, by plunging beet leaves %0a%3c into it. %0a%3c %0a%3c ^ It was only the leaf of beet, and not the root, that was eaten by the %0a%3c ancients. From Martial, B. xiii. Epig. 10, we learn that the leaves were %0a%3c preserved in a mixture of wine and pepper. %0a%3c %0a%3c ^5 Though not positively unwholesome, the leaves would form an insipid %0a%3c dish, that would not agree with all stomachs. Galen says that it cannot %0a%3c he eaten in great quantities with impunity, but Diphilus the physician, as %0a%3c quoted by Athenseus, B. ix. c. 3, says the reverse. Some MSS. read here %0a%3c “ innocentiorem,” “ more harmless.” %0a%3c %0a%3c Columella says the same, De Re Rust. B. xi. c. 3. %0a%3c %0a%3c Fee would seem to render this, “ when wine has been spoiled by cab¬ %0a%3c bage leaves being mixed with it.” %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 41.] CABBAGES ; SEVERAL VARIETIES OE THEM. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 185 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAT. 41 —cabbages; the several varieties of them. %0a%3c %0a%3c Cabbage and coleworts, which at the present day are the %0a%3c most highly esteemed of all the garden vegetables, were held %0a%3c in little repute, I find, among the Greeks; but Cato,^® on the %0a%3c other hand, sings the wondrous praises of the cabbage, the %0a%3c medicinal properties of which we shall duly enlarge^® upon %0a%3c when we come to treat of that subject. Cato distinguishes %0a%3c three varieties of the cabbage; the first, a plant with leaves %0a%3c wide open, and a large stalk; a second, with crisped leaves, to %0a%3c which he gives the name of “apiaca;”®“ and a third, with a %0a%3c thin stalk, and a smooth, tender leaf, which with him ranks %0a%3c the lowest of all. Cabbages may be sown the whole year %0a%3c through, as we find that they are cut at all periods of the year; %0a%3c the best time, however, for sowing them is at the autumnal %0a%3c equinox, and they are usually transplanted as soon as five %0a%3c leaves are visible. In the ensuing spring after the first cut¬ %0a%3c ting, the plant yields sprouts, known to us as “cymae.”®* %0a%3c These sprouts, in fact, are small shoots thro'wn out from the %0a%3c main stem, of a more delicate and tender quality than the %0a%3c cabbage itself. The exquisite palate, however, of Apicius®^ %0a%3c rejected these sprouts for the table, and his example was fol¬ %0a%3c lowed by the fastidious Drusus Caesar; who did not escape, %0a%3c however, the censures of his father, Tiberius, for being so %0a%3c over-nice. After the cymae have made their appearance the %0a%3c cabbage throws out its summer and autumn shoots, and then %0a%3c its winter ones; after which, a new crop of cymae is produced, %0a%3c there being no plant so productive as this, until, at last, it is %0a%3c quite exhausted hy its extreme fertility. A second time for %0a%3c sowing cabbages is immediately after the vernal equinox, the %0a%3c plants of this growth being transplanted at the end of spring, %0a%3c that they may not run up into sprouts before coming to a top : %0a%3c and a third sowing takes place about the summer solstice, the %0a%3c transplanting being done in summer if the soil is moist, but, %0a%3c if too dry, in autumn.

To obtain plants equally %0a%3c remarkable for their size and flavour, care must be taken first %0a%3c of all to sow the seed in ground that has had a couple of turn¬ %0a%3c ings up, and then to follow up the shoots as they appear above %0a%3c ground by moulding them up, care being taken to throw up %0a%3c the earth over them as they increase in luxuriance, and to let %0a%3c nothing but the summit appear above the surface. This kind %0a%3c is known as the Tritian^ cabbage : in money and labour it %0a%3c costs twice as much as any of the others. %0a%3c %0a%3c The other varieties of the cabbage®* are numerous—there is %0a%3c the Cumanian cabbage, with leaves that lie close to the ground, %0a%3c and a wide, open head; the Aricinian®® cabbage, too, of no %0a%3c greater height, but with more numerous leaves and thinner— %0a%3c this last is looked upon as the most useful of them all, for %0a%3c beneath nearly all of the leaves there are small shoots thrown %0a%3c out, peculiar to this variety. The cabbage, again, of Pompeii®* %0a%3c is considerably taller, the stalk, which is thin at the root, %0a%3c increasing in thickness as it rises among the leaves, which are %0a%3c fewer in number and narrower; the great merit of this cab¬ %0a%3c bage is its remarkable tenderness, although it is not able to %0a%3c stand the cold. The cabbage of Eruttium,®®’ on the other hand, %0a%3c thrives all the better for cold; the leaves of it are remarkably %0a%3c large, the stalk thin, and the flavour pungent. The leaves, %0a%3c again, of the Sabine®® cabbage are crisped to such a degree as %0a%3c to excite our surprise, and their thickness is such as to quite %0a%3c exhaust the stem ; in sweetness, however, it is said to surpass %0a%3c all the others. %0a%3c %0a%3c There have lately come into fashion the cabbqges known as %0a%3c the “ Lacuturres;”®® they are grown in the valley of Aricia, %0a%3c %0a%3c The Brassica oleracea capitata of Lamarck, and its varieties. %0a%3c %0a%3c The ordinary cabbage, or Brassica oleracea of Linneeus. %0a%3c %0a%3c A variety, Fee thinks, of the Lacuturrian cabbage. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Brassica oleracea botrytis of Linnaeus, the cauliflower. %0a%3c %0a%3c Or Calabrian cabbage : it has not been identified. %0a%3c %0a%3c ^ The Brassica oleracea Sabellica of Linnaeus, or fringed cabbage. %0a%3c %0a%3c Or “Lake-towers.” Tlie turnip-cabbage or rape-colewort, the Bras- %0a%3c sioa oleracea gongyloides of Linnaeus. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Cbap. 41.] CABBAGES ; SETERAL VARIETIES OF THEM. 187 %0a%3c %0a%3c •where there was formerly a lake, now no longer in existence, %0a%3c and a tower wdiich is still standing.

We have already^® %0a%3c spoken at considerable length of its origin, when treating of %0a%3c tlie wild plants, and have mentioned that Cato recommends %0a%3c it to be grown in reed-beds. There is another kind, again, of %0a%3c a more uncultivated nature than the garden asparagus, but less %0a%3c pungent than corruda it grows upon the mountains in dif¬ %0a%3c ferent countries, and the plains of Upper Germany are quite %0a%3c full of it, so much so, indeed, that it was a not unhappy remark %0a%3c of Tiberius Caesar, that a weed grows there which bears a re¬ %0a%3c markably strong resemblance to asparagus. That which grows %0a%3c spontaneously upon the island of Nesis, off the coast of Cam¬ %0a%3c pania, is looked upon as being by far the best of all. %0a%3c %0a%3c Garden asparagus is reproduced from roots,®* the fibres of %0a%3c which are exceedingly numerous, and penetrate to a consider¬ %0a%3c able depth. When it first puts forth its shoots, it is green; %0a%3c these in time lengthen out into stalks, which afterwards throw %0a%3c %0a%3c The same as the “ chara,” probably, mentioned by Caesar, Bell.

He re¬ %0a%3c commends that the ground prepared for it should be a moist or %0a%3c dense soil, the seed being set at intervals of half a foot every %0a%3c way, to avoid treading upon the heads; the seed, he says, %0a%3c should be put two or three into each hole, these being made %0a%3c with the dibble as the line runs—for in his day, it should be %0a%3c remembered, asparagus was only grown from seed—this being %0a%3c done about the vernal equinox. It requires, he adds, to be %0a%3c abundantly manured, and to be kept well hoed, due care being %0a%3c taken not to pull up the young plants along with the weeds. %0a%3c The first year, he says, the plants must be protected from the %0a%3c severity of the winter with a covering of straw, care being %0a%3c taken to uncover them in the spring, and to hoe and stub up %0a%3c the ground about them. In the spring of the third year, the %0a%3c plants must be set fi.re to, and the earlier the period at which %0a%3c the fire is applied, the better they will thrive. Hence it is, %0a%3c that as reed-beds grow all the more rapidly after being fired, %0a%3c asparagus is found to be a crop remarkably well suited for %0a%3c growing with them. The same author recommends, however, %0a%3c that asparagus should not be hoed before the plants have made %0a%3c their appearance above-ground, for fear of disturbing the roots ; %0a%3c and he says that in gathering the heads, they should be cut %0a%3c close to the root, and not broken off at the surface, a method %0a%3c which is sure to make them run to stalk and die. They should %0a%3c be cut, he says, until they are left to run to seed, and after the %0a%3c seed is ripe, in spring they must be fired, care being taken, as %0a%3c soon as they appear again, to hoe and manure them as before. %0a%3c After eight or nine years, he says, when the plants have be¬ %0a%3c come old, they must be renewed, after digging and manuring %0a%3c the ground, by replanting the roots at intervals of a foot, care %0a%3c being taken to employ sheep’s dung more particularly for the %0a%3c purpose, other kinds of manure being apt to produce weeds. %0a%3c %0a%3c Ho method of cultivating this plant that has since been tried %0a%3c has been found more eligible than this, with the sole exception %0a%3c that the seed is now sown about the ides of Pebruary, b)'^ laving %0a%3c “ De Re Rust. c. 161.

There is %0a%3c no soil more favourable to the gi*owth of asparagus, than that %0a%3c of the gardens of llavenna.“ %0a%3c %0a%3c We have already spoken of the corruda, by which term I %0a%3c mean the wild asparagus, bj'- the Greeks called “ orminos,” or %0a%3c “ myacanthos,” as well as by other names.

For %0a%3c it is a well-known fact, that some small plots of land, planted %0a%3c with thistles,®® in the vicinity of Great Carthage and of Cor- %0a%3c duba more particularly, produce a yearly income of six thousand %0a%3c sesterces;®® this being the way in which we make the mon¬ %0a%3c strous productions even of the earth subservient to our glut¬ %0a%3c tonous appetites, and that, too, when the very four-footed %0a%3c brutes ®’ instinctively refuse to touch them. %0a%3c %0a%3c Thistles are grown two different ways, from plants set in %0a%3c autumn, and from seed sown before the nones of Marchin %0a%3c Avhich latter case they are transplanted before the ides of No¬ %0a%3c vember,®® or, where the site is a cold one, about the time that %0a%3c the west winds prevail.

The %0a%3c best time for sowing ocimum,®* it is said, is at the festival of the %0a%3c Parilia ;®* though some say that it may be done in autumn as %0a%3c well, and recommend, when it is sown in winter, to drench %0a%3c the seed thoroughly with vinegar. Eocket,®® too, and nastur¬ %0a%3c tium®® may be grown with the greatest facility either in sum¬ %0a%3c mer or winter. Eocket, more particularly, is able to stand %0a%3c the cold, and its properties are quite different from those of %0a%3c the lettuce, as it is a great provocative of lust. Hence it is %0a%3c that we are in the habit of mixing these two plants in our %0a%3c dishes, the excess of cold in the one being compensated by the %0a%3c equal degree of heat in the other. Nasturtium has received %0a%3c that name from®* the smarting sensation which its pungency %0a%3c causes to the nostrils, and hence it is that a certain notion of %0a%3c smartness has attached itself to the word, it having become quite %0a%3c a proverbial saying, that a sluggish man should eat nasturtium, %0a%3c to arouse him from his torpidity. In Arabia, it is said, this %0a%3c plant attains a size that is quite marvellous. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 45. —RUE. %0a%3c %0a%3c Eue,®® too, is generally sown while the west winds prevail, %0a%3c as well as just after the autumnal equinox.

This plant has a great liking™ for the %0a%3c fig-tree, and for that tree only ; indeed, it never thrives better %0a%3c than when grown beneath that tree. It is generally grown %0a%3c from slips, the lower end of which is inserted in a perforated^* %0a%3c bean, which holds it fast, and so nurtures the young plant %0a%3c with its juices. It also reproduces itself;™ for the ends of the %0a%3c branches bending downw'ards, the moment they reach the %0a%3c ground, they take root again. Ocimum'*® is of a very similar %0a%3c nature to rue, except that it dries with greater difficulty. %0a%3c When rue has once gained strength, there is considerable diffi¬ %0a%3c culty in stubbing it, as it causes itching ulcerations on the %0a%3c hands, if they are not covered or previously protected by being %0a%3c rubbed with oil.

Of the cultivated poppy* there %0a%3c are three kinds, the first being the white* poppy, the seed of %0a%3c which, parched, and mixed with honey, used to be served up %0a%3c in the second course at the tables of the ancients; at the pre¬ %0a%3c sent day, too, the country people sprinkle it on the upper crust %0a%3c of their bread, making it adhere by means of the yolk of eggs, %0a%3c the under crust being seasoned with parsley and gith to %0a%3c heighten the flavour of the flour. The second kind is the %0a%3c black'* poppy, from which, upon an incision being made in the %0a%3c stalk, a milky juice distils; and the third is that known to the %0a%3c Greeks bv the name of “rhceas;”® and by us as the wild %0a%3c poppy. This last grows spontaneouslj^ but in fields, more %0a%3c particularly, which have been sown with barley : it bears a %0a%3c strong resemblance to rocket, grows to the height of a cubit, %0a%3c and bears a red flower, which quickly fades; it is to this %0a%3c flower that it is indebted for its Greek name.® %0a%3c %0a%3c As to the other kinds of poppies which spring up sponta- %0a%3c neousl)', we shall have occasion to speak of them when treat¬ %0a%3c ing of the medicinal plants.’ That the poppy has always been %0a%3c held in esteem among the Eomans, we have a proof in the %0a%3c story related of Tarquinius® Supcrbus, who, by striking down %0a%3c the tallest poppies in his garden, surreptitiously conveyed, %0a%3c %0a%3c 1 This practice, as Fee remarks, is not followed; and indeed, unless it %0a%3c is intended to transplant them, it would be attended with injurious results %0a%3c to the young plants. %0a%3c %0a%3c ® As to the poppy, for further particulars see B. xx. c. 76 and the Note. %0a%3c %0a%3c 3 The variety Album of the Papaver somniferum of modern botanists. %0a%3c %0a%3c * The variety Nigrum of the Papaver somniferum.

(9.) — FOUR KINDS OF FERULACKOUS PLANTS. HEMP. %0a%3c %0a%3c The other garden plants are of the ferulaceous kind, such as %0a%3c fennel, for instance, very grateful to serpents,^ as already %0a%3c slated,'® and used for numerous seasonings when dried; thapsia, %0a%3c too, which bears a close resemblance to fennel, and already %0a%3c mentioned by us when speaking'® of the exotic shrubs. Then, %0a%3c too, there is hemp,®® a plant remarkably useful for making %0a%3c ropes, and usually sown after the west winds have begun to %0a%3c prevail: the more thickly it is sown, the thinner are the %0a%3c stalks. The seed is gathered when ripe, just after the autumnal %0a%3c equinox, and is dried by the agency of the sun, the wind, or %0a%3c smoke.®' The hemp itself is plucked just after vintage-time, %0a%3c and is peeled and cleaned by the labourers at night. %0a%3c %0a%3c The best hemp is that of Alabanda,®® which is used more %0a%3c particular!}' for making hunting-nets, and of which there are %0a%3c three varieties. The hemp which lies nearest the bark or the %0a%3c pith is the least valuable, while that which lies in the middle, %0a%3c and hence has the name of “ mesa,” is the most esteemed. %0a%3c The hemp of Mylasa®® occupies the second rank. With re¬ %0a%3c ference to the size to which it grows, that of Rosea,®®’ in the %0a%3c Sabine territory, equals the trees in height.®^ %0a%3c %0a%3c We have already mentioned two kinds of fennel-giant when %0a%3c speaking®® of the exotic shrubs : the seed of it is used in Italy %0a%3c for food; the plant, too, admits of being preserved, and, if %0a%3c stored in earthen pots, will keep for a whole year. There are %0a%3c %0a%3c ” The plants. Fee says, that we find in these localities, are nearly %0a%3c always ferns, or else Marchantia, or mosses of the genus Hypnum. Fee %0a%3c queries whether one of these may not have been the sisymbrium of Pliny. %0a%3c Water-cresses, again, have been suggested. %0a%3c %0a%3c In B. viii. c. 41.

(10.) -THE MALADIES OF GAEDEN PLANTS. %0a%3c %0a%3c The garden plants, too, like the rest of the vegetable pro¬ %0a%3c ductions, are subject to certain maladies. Thus, for'^ instance, %0a%3c ocimum, when old, degenerates into wild thyme, and sisym¬ %0a%3c brium” into mint, while the seed of an old cabbage produces %0a%3c rape, and vice versa. Cummin, too, if not kept well hoed, is %0a%3c killed by haernodorum,^® a plant with»a single stalk, a root si¬ %0a%3c milar to a bulb in appearance, and never found except in a %0a%3c thin, meagre soil, Eesides this, cummin is liable to a peculiar %0a%3c disease of its own, the scab ocimum, too, turns pale at the %0a%3c rising of the Dog-star. All plants, indeed, will turn of a %0a%3c yellow complexion on the approach of a woman who has the %0a%3c menstrual discharge®® upon her. %0a%3c %0a%3c 'J'here are various kinds of insects,” too, that breed upon the %0a%3c garden plants—fleas, for instance, upon turnips, and cater¬ %0a%3c pillars and maggots upon radishes, as well as lettuces and cab¬ %0a%3c bages ; besides which, the last two are exposed_ to the attacks %0a%3c of slugs and snails. The leek, too, is infested with peculiar %0a%3c insects of its own ; which may very easily be taken, however, %0a%3c by laying dung upon the plants, the insects being in the habit %0a%3c of burrowing in it. Sabin us Tiro says, in his book entitled %0a%3c “ Cepurica,”®^ which he dedicated to Maecenas, that it is not %0a%3c advisable to touch rue, cuuila, mint, or ocimum with any im¬ %0a%3c plement of iron. %0a%3c %0a%3c These absurd notions are borrowed from Theophrastus, De Causis, c. 8. %0a%3c %0a%3c See B.

HOW %0a%3c %0a%3c ANTS ARE BEST DESTROYED. THE BEST REMEDIES AGAINST CATER¬ %0a%3c PILLARS AND FLIES. %0a%3c %0a%3c The same author recommenrls as a remedy against ants, %0a%3c which are by no means the slightest plague in a garden that is %0a%3c not kept well watered, to stop up the mouths of their holes with %0a%3c sca-slime or ashes. But the most efficient way of destroj’ing %0a%3c them is with the aid of the plant heliotropium some per¬ %0a%3c sons, too, are of opinion that water in which an unburnt brick %0a%3c has been soaked is injurious to them. The best protection for %0a%3c turnips is to sow a few fitebes with them, and for cabbages chick¬ %0a%3c peas, these having the effect of keeping away caterpillars. If, %0a%3c however, this precaution should have been omitted, and the %0a%3c caterpillars have alreadj'’ made their appearance, the best remedy %0a%3c is to throw upon the vegetables a decoction of wormwood,*^ or %0a%3c else of house-leek,^* known to some as “ aizoiim,” a kind of %0a%3c herb already mentioned by us. If cabbage-seed, before it is %0a%3c sown, is steeped in the juice of house-leek, the cabbages, it is %0a%3c said, are sure not be attacked b}’’ any insect. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is said, too, that all caterpillars may be effectually exter¬ %0a%3c minated, if the skull of a beast of burden is set up upon a %0a%3c stake in the garden, care being taken to employ that of a female %0a%3c only. There is a story related, too, that a river crab, hung %0a%3c up in the middle of the garden, is a preservative against the %0a%3c attacks of caterpillars. Again, there are some persons who are %0a%3c in the habit of touching with slips of blood-red cornel** such %0a%3c ])lant8 as they wish to preserve from caterpillars. Flies,*® too, %0a%3c infest well-watered gardens, and more particularly so, if there %0a%3c happen to be any shrubs there ; they may be got rid of, how¬ %0a%3c ever, by burning galbanum.^® %0a%3c %0a%3c (11.)

Other plants, again, are equally benefitted %0a%3c by being watered with fresh water, the most desirable for the %0a%3c purpose being that which is the coldest and the sweetest to %0a%3c drink: pond and drain-water, on the other hand, are not so %0a%3c good, as they are apt to carry the seeds of weeds along with %0a%3c them. It is rain,*^ however, that forms the principal aliment %0a%3c of plants; in addition to Avliich, it kills the insects as they %0a%3c develope themselves upon them. %0a%3c %0a%3c CH.AP. 60. (12.)- THE PROPER METHOD OF WATERING GARDENS. %0a%3c %0a%3c The proper times for watering are the morning and the %0a%3c evening, to prevent the water from being heated by the sun ; %0a%3c with the sole exception, however, of ocimum, which requires %0a%3c to be watered at midday; indeed, this plant, it is generally %0a%3c thought, will grow with additional rapiditj’, if it is watered %0a%3c with boiling water when sown. All plants, when trans- %0a%3c %0a%3c Tliis is certainly not true with reference to the leguminous and gra¬ %0a%3c mineous plants. It is pretty generally known as a fact, that wheat has %0a%3c germinated after being buried in tlie eartii two thousand years : murnmy- %0a%3c wheat, at the present day, is almost universally known. %0a%3c %0a%3c Eain-water, if collected in cisterns, and exposed to the heat of the %0a%3c sun, is the most beneficial of all; rain has the efl'ect also of killing nume¬ %0a%3c rous insects which have bred in the previous drought. %0a%3c %0a%3c From Theophrastus, II. vii. c. 5. Evening is generally preferred to %0a%3c morning for tliis purpose; the evaporation not being so quick, and the %0a%3c plant profiting more from the water. > %0a%3c %0a%3c It should, however, be of a middling temperature, and warmed to %0a%3c some extent by the rays of the sun. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 202 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c flint's natural histort. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XIX, %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c planted, grow all the better and larger for it, leeks and turnips %0a%3c more particularly. Transplanting, too, is attended with cer¬ %0a%3c tain remedial effects, and acts as a preservative to certain plants, %0a%3c such as scallions, for instance, leeks, radishes, parsley, lettuces, %0a%3c rape, and cucumbers. All the wild plantsare generally %0a%3c smaller in the leaf and stalk than the cultivated ones, and have %0a%3c more acrid juices, cunila, wild marjoram, and rue, for example. %0a%3c Tudeed, it is only the lapathum that is better in a wild state %0a%3c than cultivated : in its cultivated state it is the same plant %0a%3c that is known to us as the “rumix,” being the most vigorous*® %0a%3c by far of all the plants that are grown ; so much so, indeed, %0a%3c that it is said that when it has once taken root, it will last for %0a%3c ever, and can never be extirpated from the soil, more particu¬ %0a%3c larly if water happens to be near at hand. Its juices, whicli %0a%3c are employed only in ptisans,*® as an article of food, have tlie %0a%3c effect of imparting to them a softer and more exquisite flavour. %0a%3c The wild variety®® is employed for many medicinal purposes. %0a%3c %0a%3c So true it is, that the careful research of man has omitted %0a%3c nothing, that I have even met with a poem,®* in which I fiud %0a%3c it stated, that if pellets of goats’ dung, the size of a bean, are %0a%3c hollowed out, and the seed of leeks, rocket, lettuces, parsley, %0a%3c endive, and cresses is inserted in them, and then sown, the %0a%3c l)lants will thrive in a marvellous degi-ee. Plants®' in a wild %0a%3c state, it is generally thought, are more dry and acrid than when %0a%3c cultivated. %0a%3c %0a%3c ' CHAP. 61. —THE JUICES AND FLAVOURS OP G.A.RDEN HERBS. %0a%3c %0a%3c This, too, reminds me that I ought to make some mention %0a%3c of the difference between the juices and flavours of the garden %0a%3c herbs, a difference which is more perceptible here than in the, %0a%3c fruits even.®® In cunila, for instance, wild marjoram, cresses, %0a%3c and mustard, the flavour is acrid; in wormwood ®* and ceu- %0a%3c %0a%3c These statements are consistent with modern experience. %0a%3c %0a%3c See B.

As to panax, we have spoken of it at suflScient length %0a%3c already,® Libanotis grows in a thin, crumbly soil, and is %0a%3c generally sown in spots exposed to the falling dews ; the root, %0a%3c which is just like that of olusatrum,® has a smell in no waj' %0a%3c differing from that of frankincense ; when a year old, it is ex¬ %0a%3c tremely wholesome for the stomach ; some persons give it the %0a%3c name of rosmarinum.® Smyrnium is a garden herb that grows %0a%3c in similar soils, and has a root which smells like myrrh : sili- %0a%3c quastrum, too, is grown in a similar manner. %0a%3c %0a%3c Other plants, again, differ from the preceding ones, both in %0a%3c smell and taste, anise for example ; indeed, so great is the %0a%3c difference in this respect, and in their relative virtues, that not %0a%3c only are the properties of each modified by the other, but quite %0a%3c neutralized even. It is in this way that our cooks correct %0a%3c the flavour of vinegar in their dishes with parsley, and our %0a%3c butlers employ the same plant, enclosed in sachets, for removing %0a%3c a bad odour in wine, %0a%3c %0a%3c “ See B.

It %0a%3c is upon principle that w^e have thought proper not to enlarge %0a%3c upon the medicinal properties of each plant when treating of %0a%3c it; for it is a quite different class of persons that is interested %0a%3c in knowing their curative properties, and there is no doubt %0a%3c that both classes of readers would have been inconvenienced in %0a%3c a very material degree, if these two points of view had engaged %0a%3c our attention at the same moment. As it is, each class will %0a%3c have its own portion to refer to, while those who desire to do %0a%3c so, will experience no difficulty in uniting them, with reference %0a%3c to any subject of which we may happen to treat. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Summary. —Eemarkable facts, narratives, and observations, %0a%3c one thousand one hundi’ed and forty-four. %0a%3c %0a%3c Roman authors ciuoted. —Maccius Plautus,®’ M.
