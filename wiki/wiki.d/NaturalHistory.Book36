LUXURY DISPLAYED IN THE USE OF VARIOUS KINDS %0a%0aOF MARBLE. %0a%0aIt now remains for us to speak of stones, or, in other words, %0athe leading folly of the day ; to say nothing at all of our taste %0afor gems and amber, crystal and murrhine vases. 1 For every- %0athing of which we have previously treated, down to the %0apresent Book, may, by some possibility or other, have the ap- %0apearance of having been created for the sake of man : but^ as %0ato the mountains, Nature has made those for herself, as a kind %0aof bulwark for keeping together the bowels of the earth; as %0aalso for the purpose of curbing the violence of the rivers, of %0abreaking the waves of the sea, and so, by opposing to them %0athe very hardest of her materials, putting a check upon those %0aelements which are never at rest. And yet we must hew %0adown these mountains, forsooth, and carry them off; and this, %0afor no other reason than to gratify our luxurious inclinations : %0aheights which in former days it was reckoned a miracle even to %0ahave crossed ! %0a%0aOur forefathers regarded as a prodigy the passage of the %0aAlps, first by Hannibal, 2 and, more recently, by the Cimbri : %0abut at the present day, these very mountains are cut asunder %0ato yield us a thousand different marbles, promontories are %0athrown open to the sea, and the face of Nature is being every- %0awhere reduced to a level. "We now carry away the barriers %0athat were destined for the separation of one nation from %0aanother; we construct ships for the transport of our marbles ; %0aand, amid the waves, the most boisterous element of Nature, %0awe convey the summits of the mountains to and fro : a thing, %0ahowever, that is even less unpardonable than to go on the %0a%0a1 See B. xxxvii. cc. 7, 8, 11. %0a%0a2 See the lines of Juvenal, Sat. x. 1. 151, etseq. %0a%0aVOL.

Let each reflect, when he hears of the %0ahigh prices set upon these things, when he sees these ponderous %0amasses carted and carried away, how many there are whose %0alife is passed far more happily without them. For what %0autility or for what so-called pleasure do mortals make them- %0aselves the agents, or, more truly speaking, the victims of such %0aundertakings, except in order that others may take their re- %0apose in the midst of variegated stones ? Just as though too, the %0ashades of night, which occupy one half of each man's existence, %0awould forbear to curtail these imaginary delights. %0a%0aCHAP. 2. — WHO WAS THE FIRST TO EMPLOY MARBLE IN PUBLIC %0aBUILDINGS. %0a%0aIndeed, while making these reflections, one cannot but feel %0aashamed of the men of ancient times even. There are still in %0aexistence censorial 4 laws, which forbid the kernels 5 in the %0aneck of swine to be served at table, dormice too, and other %0athings too trifling to mention : and yet there has been no law %0apassed, forbidding marble to be imported, or the seas to be %0atraversed in search of it ! %0a%0a(2.) It may possibly be observed, that this was, because %0amarble was not then introduced. Such, however, is not the %0afact ; for in the aedileship of M. Scaurus, 6 three hundred and %0asixty columns were to be seen imported ; for the decorations of %0aa temporary theatre, too, one that was destined to be in use for %0abarely a single month. And yet the laws were silent thereon ; %0ain a spirit of indulgence for the amusements of the public, no %0adoubt. But then, why such indulgence? or how do vices %0amore insidiously steal upon us than under the plea of serving %0athe public ? By what other way, in fact, did ivory, gold, and %0aprecious stones, first come into use with private individuals ? %0a%0aCan we say that there is now anything that we have re- %0aserved for the exclusive use of the gods r. However, be it so, %0alet us admit of this indulgence for the amusements of the %0apublic; but still, why did the laws maintain their silence %0a%0a3 lie alludes to vessels made of crystal, -which, as Dalechamps remarks, %0awas long supposed to be nothing but iGe in a concrete form.

And yet the laws still preserved their %0asilence, when such enormous masses as these were being car- %0aried past the earthenware 9 pediments of the temples of the %0agods, to the house of a private individual ! %0a%0aCHAP. 3. (3.) — WHO WAS THE FIRST TO ERECT COLXJMN8 OF %0aFOREIGN MARBLE AT ROME. %0a%0aAnd yet it cannot be said that Scaurus, by way of a first %0aessay in vice, took the City by surprise, in a state of ignorance %0aand totally unguarded against such evils as these. Already %0ahad L. Crassus, 10 the orator, he who was the first to possess %0apillars of foreign marble, and in this same Palatium too, re- %0aceived from M. Brutus, on the occasion of a dispute, the nick- %0aname of the "Palatine Venus," for his indulgence in this %0akind of luxury. The material, I should remark, was Hymet- %0atian marble, and the pillars were but six in number, and not %0aexceeding some twelve feet in height. Our forefathers were %0aguilty of this omission, no doubt, because morals were univer- %0asally contaminated ; and, seeing that things which had been in- %0aterdicted had been forbidden in vain, they preferred the absence %0aof laws to laws that were no better than a dead letter. These %0aparticulars and others in the 6equel will show that we are so %0afar improved ; for who is there at the present day that has, in %0ahis atrium, any such massive columns as these of Scaurus ? %0a%0aBut before proceeding to treat of the several varieties of this %0amaterial, it will be as well to mention the various artists, and %0athe degrees of estimation in which they are held, who have %0aworked in marble. We will, therefore, proceed to review the %0asculptors who have flourished at different periods. %0a%0a1 See Chapter 8 of this Book. 8 In the Eleventh Eegion of the City. %0a* See B. xxxv. cc. 43, 4o. 10 See B. xvii. c. 1. %0a%0a%0a%0a308 %0a%0a%0a%0apliny's natural history.

THE MOST CKLK- %0aBRATED SCULPTORS AND WORKS IN MARBLE, TWO HUNDRED AND %0aTWENTY-FIVE IN NUMBER. %0a%0aThe first artists who distinguished themselves in the sculp- %0ature of marble, were Dipcenus 11 and Scyllis, natives of the Isle %0aof Crete. At this period the Medians were still in power, and %0aCyrus had not begun to reign in Persia ; their date being about %0athe fiftieth Olympiad. They afterwards repaired to Sicyon, a %0astate which for a length of time 12 was the adopted country of %0aall such pursuits as these. The people of Sicyon had made a %0acontract with them for the execution of certain statues of the %0agods ; but, before completing the work, the artists complained %0aof some injustice being done them, and retired to iEtolia. Im- %0amediately upon this, the state was afflicted with sterility and %0afamine, and dreadful consternation was the result. Upon %0aenquiry being made as to a remedy for these evils, the Pythian %0aApollo made answer, that Dipcenus and Scyllis must complete %0athe statues of the gods ; an object which was attained at the %0acost of great concessions and considerable sums of money. %0aThe statues were those of Apollo, 13 Diana, Hercules, and %0aMinerva; the last of which was afterwards struck by %0alightning. %0a%0a(5.) Before these artists were in existence, there had already %0aappeared Melas, a sculptor of the Isle of Chios; and, in succes- %0asion to him, his son Micciades, and his grandson Archermus; 14 %0awhose sons, Bupalus and Athenis, afterwards attained the highest %0aeminence in the art. These last were contemporaries of the %0apoet Hipponax, who, it is well known, lived in the sixtieth %0aOlympiad. Now, if a person only reckons, going upwards %0afrom their time to that of their great-grandfather, he will find %0a%0a11 These two artists are invariably mentioned together. Pausanias, B. %0aii. c. 1^ and B. iii. c. 17, speaks of them as the pupils or sons of Dffida- %0alus ; only intimating thereby, as Sillig thinks, that they Avere the first %0asculptors -worthy of being associated with the father of artists. Pausanias, %0aB. ii. c. 22, mentions ebony statues by them. %0a%0a13 In the time of the Telchines, before the arrival of Inachus in Argolis. %0a%0a13 Pausanias says that tbis statue was completed by their pupils. Cle- %0amens Alexandrinus mentions other works of theirs. %0a%0a14 Another reading is "Anthermus." Of many of these sculptors, no %0afurther particulars are known. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 4 ] AUTIST3 WHO EXCELLED IN SCELPTTJEE. 309 %0a%0a%0a%0athat the art of sculpture must have necessarily originated about %0athe commencement of the era of the Olympiads. Hipponax %0abeing a man notorious for his ugliness, the two artists, by way %0aof joke, 15 exhibited a statue of him for the ridicule of the pub- %0alie. Indignant at this, the poet emptied upon them all the %0abitterness of his verses ; to such an extent indeed, that, as %0asome believe, they were driven to hang themselves in despair. %0aThis, however, is not the fact ; for, at a later period, these %0aartists executed a number of statues in the neighbouring islands ; %0aatDelos for example, with an inscription subjoined to the effect, %0athat Chios was rendered famous not only by its vines 15 * but by %0athe works of the sons of Archermus as well. The people of %0aLasos 16 still show a Diana that was made by them ; and we %0afind mention also made of a Diana at Chios, the work of their %0ahands : it is erected on an elevated spot, and the features ap- %0apear stern to a person as he enters, and joyous as he departs. %0aAt Rome, there are some statues by these artists on the summit %0aof the Temple 17 of the Palatine Apollo, and, indeed, in most of %0athe buildings that were erected by the late Emperor Augustus. %0aAt Delos and in the Isle, of Lesbos there were formerly some %0asculptures by their father to be seen. Ambracia too, Argos, %0aandCleonse, were filled with productions of the sculptor Dipoenus. %0a%0aAll these artists, however, used nothing but the white marble %0aof the Isle of Paros, a stone which was known as " lychnites" %0aat first, because, according to Varro, it was cut in the quarries %0aby lamplight. 18 Since their time, many other whiter marbles %0ahave been discovered, and very recently that of the quarries %0aof Luna 19 With reference to the marble of Paros, there is one %0avery marvellous circumstance related ; in a single block that %0awas split with wedges, a figure 20 of Silenusmade its appearance. %0a%0a1* Another cause of the quarrel is said to have been the refusal of Bu- %0apalus to give his daughter in marriage to Hipponax. Ibis quarrel is re- %0aferred to in the Greek Anthology, B. iu. Epigr. 26. %0a».

Indeed, it is said, %0athat Phidias himself worked in marble, and that there is a %0aVenus of his at Eome, a work of extraordinary beauty, in the %0abuildings of Octavia. 22 A thing, however, that is universally %0aadmitted, is the fact that he was the instructor of Alcamenes," %0athe Athenian, one of the most famous among the sculptors. %0aBy this last artist, there are numerous statues in the temples %0aat Athens ; as also, without the walls there, the celebrated %0aVenus, known as the Aphrodite sv xjjto/s, 21 a work to which %0aPhidias himself, it is said, put the finishing hand. Another %0adisciple also of Phidias was Agoracritus 25 of Paros, a great %0afavourite with his master, on account of his extremely youthful %0aage; and for which reason, it is said, Phidias gave his own name %0ato many of that artist's works. The two pupils entering into a %0acontest as to the superior execution of a statue of Venus, %0aAlcamenes was successful ; not that his work was superior, but %0abecause his fellow-citizens chose to give their suffrages in his %0afavour in preference to a stranger. It was for this reason, it %0ais said, that Agoracritus sold his statue, on the express condi- %0ation that it should never be taken to Athens, and changed its %0aname to that of Nemesis. 26 It was accordingly erected at %0aEhamnus, 27 a borough of Attica, and M. Varro has considered %0ait superior to every other statue. There is also to be seen in %0a%0a21 See B. xxxv. c. 44. 22 See B. xxxv. cc. 37, 40. %0a%0a23 See B. xxxiv. c. 19. %0a%0a24 " In the Gardens." A suburb of Athens, in which there was a tem- %0aple of Venus, or Aphrodite Urania. %0a%0a25 He is mentioned also by Pausanias and Strabo. %0a%0a26 The Goddess of Retribution. Pausanias, B. i. c. 33, stirs that it %0awas the work of Phidias, and that it was made of Parian marble, which %0athe Persians had brought into Attica for the purpose of erecting a trophy. %0aStrabo, however, in B. ix., says that it was the work of Agoracritus and %0aDiodotus (an artist otherwise unknown), and that it was not at all inferior %0ato the production of Phidias. Tzetzes again, Suidas, and Photius, say %0athat it was the work of Phidias, and that it was presented by him to his %0afavourite pupil, Agoracritus. Sillig rejects the story of the contest, and %0athe decision by the suffrages of the Athenian people. Some modern %0awriters have doubted also, whether a statue of Venus could be modified so %0aas to represent Nemesis; but not with sufficient reasoD, Sillig thinks. %0a%0a* See B. iv. c. 11. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 4.] ATtTISTS WHO EXCELLED IN SCULPTURE. 311 %0a%0a%0a%0athe Temple of the Great Mother, in the same city, another %0awork 28 by Agoracritus. %0a%0aAmong all nations which the fame of the Olympian Jupiter %0ahas reached, Phidias is looked upon, beyond all doubt, as %0athe most famous of artists : but to let those who have never %0aeven seen his works, know how deservedly he is esteemed, %0awe will take this opportunity of adducing a few slight proofs %0aof the genius which he displayed. In doing this, we shall %0anot appeal to the beauty of his Olympian Jupiter, nor yet to %0athe vast proportions of his Athenian Miner va, six and twenty %0acubits in height, and composed of ivory and gold ; but it is to %0athe shield of this last statue that we shall draw attention ; %0aupon the convex face of which he has chased a combat of the %0aAmazons, while, upon the concave side of it, he has repre- %0asented the battle between the Gods and the Giants. Upon %0athe sandals again, we see the wars of the Lapithae and %0aCentaurs, so careful has he been to fill every smallest portion %0aof his work with some proof or other of his artistic skill. To %0athe story chased upon the pedestal of the statue, the name of %0athe "Birth of Pandora"* 9 has been given; and the figures %0aof new-born 30 gods to be seen upon it are no less than twenty %0ain number. The figure of Victory, in particular, is most %0aadmirable, and connoisseurs are greatly struck with the ser- %0apent and the sphinx in bronze lying beneath the point of %0athe spear. Let thus much be said incidentally in reference to %0aan artist who can never be sufficiently praised ; if only to let %0ait be understood that the richness of his genius was always %0aequal to itself, even in the very smallest details. %0a%0a"When speaking 31 of the statuaries, we have already given %0athe period at which Praxiteles flourished ; an artist, who, in %0athe glory which he acquired by his works in marble, sur- %0apassed even himself. There are some works of his in the %0aCeramicus 32 at Athens ; but, superior to all the statues, not %0aonly of Praxiteles, but of any other artist that ever existed, %0ais his Cnidian Venus ; for the inspection of which, many per- %0asons before now have purposely undertaken a voyage to %0a%0a28 A statue, Sillig supposes, of the goddess Cybele. %0a%0a29 " Pandoras Genesis." . %0a%0a30 Sillig is of opinion that this passage is corrupt, and is inclined^ to %0athink, with Panofka, that the reading should be "nascenti adstautes,"— %0agods "standing by the new-born" Pandora. %0a%0a« In B. xxxiv. c. 19. 32 See P>. xxxv. c. 4o. %0a%0a%0a%0a312 %0a%0a%0a%0aPLINY'S NATURAL HISTORY. [Book XXXVI. %0a%0a%0a%0aCnidos. The artist made two statues of the goddess, and %0aoffered them both for sale: one of them was represented %0awith drapery, 33 and for this reason was preferred 34 by the people %0aof Cos, who had the choice ; the second was offered them at %0athe same price, but, on the grounds of propriety and modesty, %0athey thought fit to choose the other. Upon this, the Cnidians %0apurchased the rejected statue, 35 and immensely superior has it %0aalways been held in general estimation. At a later period, %0aKing Nicomedes wished to purchase this statue of the Cni- %0adians, and made them an offer to pay off the whole of their %0apublic debt, which was very large. They preferred, however, %0ato submit to any extremity rather than part with it ; and with %0agood reason, for by this statue Praxiteles has perpetuated the %0aglory of Cnidos. The little temple in which it, is placed is %0aopen on all sides, so that the beauties 36 of the statue admit of %0a%0a33 " Velata specie." There has been much discussion about the mean- %0aing of these words ; and Sillig is of opinion that the figure was repre- %0asented draped in a garment, which, while it seemed designed to hide the %0aperson, really exposed it to view. This dress would not improbably re- %0acommend it additionally to the inhabitants of Cos, who were skilled in %0amaking the Com vestes, garments which, while they covered the body, re- %0avealed its naked charms. See further mention of them in B. ix. c. 26. %0a%0a34 Visconti thinks that a statue still preserved in the Royal Museum at %0aParis, is a copy of the Coan Venus. It has, however, a figure of Cupid %0aassociated with it, which, as Sillig observes, militates against the suppo- %0asition. %0a%0a35 The ancient writers abound in praises of this wonderful statue. %0aLucian, however, has given the most complete and artistic description of %0ait. It was supposed by the ancients, to represent Venus as standing be- %0afore Paris, when he awarded to her the prize of beauty ; but it has been %0awell remarked, that the drapery in the right hand, and the vase by the %0aside of the figure, indicate that she has either just left or is about to enter %0athe bath. The artist modelled it from Phryne, a courtesan or hetsera of %0aAthens, of whom he was greatly enamoured. It was ultimately carried %0ato Constantinople, where it perished by fire in the reign of Justinian. It %0ais doubtful whether there are any copies of it in existence. There is, %0ahowever, a so-called copy in the gardens of the Vatican, and another in %0athe Glyptothek, at Munich. A Venus in the Museo Pio-Clementino, at %0aRome, is considered by Visconti and others to have been a copy of the %0aCnidian Venus, with the addition of drapery. It is supposed that Cleo- %0amenes, in making the Venus de Medici, imitated the Cnidian Venus in %0asome degree. %0a%0a36 There are numerous Epigrams in reference to this statue in the Greek %0aAnthology ; the most striking line in any of which is the beautiful Pen- %0atameter : %0a%0a%3ct>tv\ %3cp(vl irov yvfivr/v eide TTpaStrtXjjc; %0a" Alas ! where has Praxiteles me naked seen i" %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 4.] AETIST8 WIIO EXCELLED IN SCCLKTUBE. 313 %0a%0a%0a%0abeing seen from every point of view ; an arrangement which %0awas favoured by the goddess herself, it is generally believed. %0aIndeed, from whatever point it is viewed, its execution is %0aequally worthy of admiration. A certain individual, it is %0asaid, became enamoured of this statue, and, concealing himself %0ain the temple during the night, gratified his lustful passion %0aupon it, traces of which are to be seen in a stain left upon %0athe marble. 37 %0a%0aThere are also at Cnidos some other statues in marble, the %0aproductions of illustrious artists ; a Father Liber 38 by Bryaxis, 39 %0aanother by Scopas, 40 and a Minerva by the same hand : indeed, %0athere is no greater proof of the supreme excellence of the %0aVenus of Praxiteles than the fact that, amid such productions %0aas these, it is the only one that we generally find noticed. %0aBy Praxiteles, too, there is a Cupid, a statue which occa- %0asioned 41 one of the charges brought by Cicero against Verres, %0aand for the sake of seeing which persons used to visit Thespiae: %0aat the present day, it is to be seen in the Schools 42 of Octavia. %0aBy the same artist there is also another Cupid, without %0adrapery, at Parium, a colony of the Propontis ; equal to the %0aCnidian Venus in the fineness of its execution, and said to have %0abeen the object of a similar outrage. For one Alcetas, a %0aBhodian, becoming deeply enamoured of it, left upon the %0amarble similar traces of the violence of his passion. %0a%0aAt Rome there are, by Praxiteles, a Flora, a Triptolemus, %0aand a Ceres, in the Gardens of Servilius ; statues of Good %0aSuccess 43 and Good Fortune, in the Capitol ; as also some %0aMaenades, 44 and figures known as Thyiades 45 and Caryatides j 16 %0a%0a37 Lucian, Valerius Maximus, and Athenaeus, tell the same improbable %0astory, borrowing it from Posidippus the historian. 38 Bacchus. %0a%0a3» See B. xxxiv. c. 19. 40 See B. xxxiv. c. 19. %0a%0a41 Pliny is mistaken here : for in the time of Cicero, as we find in Verr. %0a4, 2, 4, the Thespian Cupid was still at Thespiae, in Beeotia, where it had %0abeen dedicated by Phryne, and was not removed to Rome till the time of %0athe emperors. It was the Parian Cupid, originally made for the people of %0aParium, that, after coming into the possession of Heius, a rich Sicilian, %0awas forcibly taken from him by Verres. %0a%0a42 Where it was destroyed by fire in the reign of Titus.

There is, by him, at Pergamus, a splendid Group" of %0aWrestlers, a work that has been highly praised, and in which %0athe fingers hare all the appearance of being impressed upon %0areal flesh rather than upon marble. At Eome there are by %0ahim, a Latona, in the Temple of the Palatium ; a Venus, in the %0abuildings that are memorials of Asinius Pollio ; and an^scu- %0alapius, and a Diana, in the Temple of Juno situate within %0athe Porticos of Octavia. %0a%0aScopas 60 rivals these artists in fame : there are by him, a %0aVenus 61 and a Pothos, 52 statues which are venerated at Samo- %0athrace with the most august ceremonials. He was also the %0asculptor of the Palatine Apollo ; a Vesta seated, in the Gardens %0aof Servilius, and represented with two Bends* 3 around her, a %0awork that has been highly praised ; two similar Bends, to be %0aseen upon the buildings of Asinius Pollio ; and some figures of %0aCanephori 61 in the same place. But the most highly esteemed %0aof all his works, are those in the Temple erected by Cneius %0aDomitius, 55 in the Plaminian Circus; a figure of Neptune %0ahimself, a Thetis and Achilles, Nereids seated upon dolphins, %0acetaceous fishes, and 56 sea-horses, 57 Tritons, the train of Phor- %0a%0amost bitter servitude, as " hewers of wood and drawers of water."

The KafinTtjp was the bend or %0aturning, round the goal in the race-course for chariots ; and as Vesta was %0asymbolical of the earth, these figures, Sillig thinks, probably represented %0atiie poles, as goals of the sun's course. %0a%0a64 Figures of Virgins, carrying on their heads baskets filled with ob- %0ajects consecrated to Minerva. %0a%0a« Dedicated to Neptune by Cneius Domitius Ahenobarbus, in the Ninth %0aLegion of the City. %0a%0a56 "Et" appears a preferable reading to the "aut" of the Bamberg MS. %0a%0a51 " Hippocampi."

In addition to the works %0aby him already mentioned, and others of the existence of %0awhich we are ignorant, there is still to be seen a colossal Mara %0aof his, seated, in the Temple erected by Brutus Callaecus, 60 %0aalso in the Flaminian Circus ; as also, a naked Venus, of an- %0aterior date to that by Praxiteles, and a production that would %0abe quite sufficient to establish the renown of any other place. %0a%0aAt Rome, it is true, it is quite lost sight of amid such a vast %0amultitude of similar works of art : and then besides, the inat- %0atention to these matters that is induced by such vast numbers %0aof duties and so many items of business, quite precludes the %0agenerality of persons from devoting their thoughts to the %0asubject. For, in fact, the admiration that is due to this art, %0anot only demands an abundance of leisure, but requires that %0aprofound silence should reign upon the spot. Hence it is, %0athat the artist is now forgotten, who executed the statue of %0aVenus that was dedicated by the Emperor Vespasianus in his %0aTemple of Peace, a work well worthy of the high repute of %0aancient times. With reference, too, to the Dying Children of %0aNiobe, in the Temple of the Sosian 61 Apollo, there is an equal %0adegree of uncertainty, whether it is the work 62 of Scopas or of %0aPraxiteles. So, too, as to the Father Janus, a work that was %0abrought from Egypt and dedicated in his Temple 63 by Augus- %0atus, it is a question by which of these two artists 61 it was made : %0aat the present day, however, it is quite hidden from us by the %0a%0athe small fish so called in B. xxxii. cc. 20, 23. 27, 30, 35, 38, 50, and 53, %0aand alluded to in B. ix. c. 1 ; the Syngnathus hippocampus of Linnaeus. %0a58 A sea-divinity. ^ "Pistrices."

There are, too, in the Schools 65 of %0aOctavia, many other highly attractive works, the authors of %0awhich are now unknown : four Satyrs, for example, one of %0awhich carries in his arms a Father Liber, robed in the palla; 68 %0aanother similarly supports the Goddess Libera; 67 a third is %0apacifying a child who is crying ; and a fourth is giving a child %0asome water to drink, from a cup ; two Zephyrs also, who %0aagitate their flowing drapery with their breath. No less is %0athe uncertainty that prevails as to the authors of the statues %0anow to be seen in the Septa; 68 an Olympus 69 and Pan, and a %0aCharon and Achilles; 70 and yet their high reputation has %0acaused them to be deemed valuable enough for their keepers %0ato be made answerable for their safety at the cost of their lives. %0a%0aScopas had for rivals and contemporaries, Bryaxis, 71 Timo- %0atheus," and Leochares, 73 artists whom we are bound to men- %0ation together, from the fact that they worked together at the %0aMausoleum ; such being the name of the tomb that was %0aerected by his wife Artemisia in honour of Mausolus, a petty %0aking of Caria, who died in the second year of the hundred and %0aseventh Olympiad. It was through the exertions of these %0aartists more particularly, that this work came to be reckoned %0aone of the Seven Wonders of the "World. 71 The circumfer- %0aence 75 of this building is, in all, four hundred and forty feet, %0a%0a65 See B. xxxv. c. 37. %0a%0a66 A large upper garment, reaching to the ankles. %0a%0a67 Both Liber and Libera were originally Italian Divinities, who pre- %0asided over the vine and the fields.

A fifth artist also took part in the %0awork ; for above the Pteron there is a pyramid erected, equal %0ain height to the building below, and formed of four and %0atwenty steps, which gradually taper upwards towards the %0asummit; a platform, crowned with a representation of a four- %0ahorse chariot by Pythis.

He is of opinion that %0ain the first place, a quadrangular main building was erected, 63 feet in %0alength on the north and south, the breadth of the east and west faces %0abeing shorter, some 42 feet perhaps. Secondly, that there was a screen of %0a36 columns surrounding the main building, and 411 feet in circumference. %0a(He adopts this reading in preference to the 440 feet of the Bamb&rg MS.) %0aThat the longer sides of this screen were 113.25 feet in extent, and the %0ashorter 92.125 feet. That between the main building and this screen, or %0acolonnade, there was an interval of 25.125 feet. Thirdly, that the colon- %0anade and the main buildings were united by a vaulted roof, and that this %0aunion formed the " Pteron." Fourthly, that rising from this Pteron, %0athere was a quadrangular truncated pyramid, formed of twenty-four steps, %0aand surmounted with a chariot of marble. This would allow, speaking in %0around numbers, 37£ feet for the height of the main body of the building, %0a87j feet for the pyramid, and twenty-five feet for the height of the chariot %0aaud the figure which it doubtless contained. %0a%0a81 Supposed to be the person alluded to by Horace, 1 Sat. 3, 90. %0a%0a82 He is mentioned also by Tatian, and is supposed to have lived about %0athe tiiue of Alexander the Great. %0a%0a%0a%0a318 %0a%0a%0a%0aTLINY'S NATURAL HISTORY.

Diogenes %0aLaertius adds, that whereas artists had previously represented the Graces %0anaked, Socrates sculptured them with drapery. %0a%0a86 See B. xxxiv. c. 19. 87 See B. xxxv. c. 45. %0a%0a88 Or Muses of Thespiaj, in Bceotia. %0a%0a89 There have been several distinguished sculptors, all of this name. %0aA statuary, son of Apollodorus the Athenian, made the celebrated Venus %0ade Medici.

These two artists made it a sort of rivalry %0aas to their parentage, for they declared that, although Apollodor us %0awas their natural progenitor, Menecrates 98 would appear to have %0abeen their father. In the same place, too, there is a Father %0aLiber," by Eutychides, 1 highly praised. Near the Portico of Oc- %0atavia, there is an Apollo, by Philiscus 2 of Rhodes, placed in the %0aTemple of that God ; a Latona and Diana also ; the Nine Muses ; %0aand another Apollo, without drapery. The Apollo holding the %0aLyre, in the same temple, was executed by Timarchides. 3 In %0athe Temple of Juno, within the Porticos of Octavia, there is %0aa figure of that goddess, executed by Dionysius, 4 and another %0aby Polycles, 5 as also other statues by Praxiteles. 6 This Poly- %0acles, too, in conjunction with Dionysius, 7 the son of Timar- %0achides, made the statue of Jupiter, which is to be seen in the %0aadjoining temple. 8 The figures of Pan and Olympus Wrestling, %0ain the same place, are by Heliodorus ; 9 and they are considered %0ato be the next finest group 10 of this nature in all the world. The %0asame artist also executed a Yenus at the Bath, and Polychar- %0amus another Venus, in an erect 11 posture. %0a%0aBy the honourable place which the work of Lysias occupies, %0awe may see in what high esteem it was held by the late Em- %0aperor Augustus, who consecrated it in honour of his father %0aOctavius, in the Palatium, placing it on an arch within a small %0a%0aThebes, to the flanks of an infuriated bull, in revenge for the death of %0atheir mother, Antiope, who had been similarly slain by her. This group %0ais supposed still to exist, in part, in the " Farnese Bull," which has been %0ain a great measure restored.

Such is the case with the Laocoon, %0afor example, in the palace of the Emperor Titus, a work that %0amay be looked upon as preferable to any other production of %0athe art of painting or of statuary. It is sculptured from a single %0ablock, both the main figure as well as the children, and the ser- %0apents with their marvellous folds. This group was made in con- %0acert by three most eminent artists, 11 Agesander, Polydorus, and %0aAthenodorus, natives of llhodes. In similar manner also, the %0apalaces of the Caesars, in the Palatium, have been filled with %0amost splendid statuary, the work of Craterus, in conjunction %0a%0a12 In B. xxxiii. c. 55, and B. xxxiv. c. 18. %0a%0a13 A sculptor of the age of Alexander the Great. He is also mentioned %0aby Tatian. For an account of Callisthenes, see end of B. xii. %0a%0a11 Winckelinann supposes that these artists lived in the time of Ly- %0asippus ; but, as may be discovered from an attentive examination of the %0apresent passage, Lessing and Thiersch are probably right in considering %0athem to have been contemporaries of the Emperor Titus. This group is %0agenerally supposed to have been identical with the Laocoon still to be seen %0ain the Court of the Belvedere, in the Vatican at Rome ; having been %0afound, in 1506, in a vault beneath the spot known as the Place de Selte %0aSale, by Felix de Fredi, who surrendered it, in consideration of a pension, %0ato Pope Julius II. The group, however, is not made of a single block, %0awhich has caused some to doubt its identity : but it is not improbable, that %0awhen originally made, its joints were not perceptible to a common ob- %0aserver. The spot, too, where it was found was actually part of the palace %0aof Titus. It is most probable that the artists had the beautiful episode %0aof Laocoon in view, as penned by Virgil, JEn. B. II. ; though Ajasson %0adoubts whether they derived any inspiration from it. Laocoon, in the %0asublime expression of his countenance, is doing any thing, he says, but — %0a%0a" Clamores simul horrendos ad sidera tollit." %0a%0au Sending dire outcries to the stars of heaven." %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 4.] A11TI3TS WHO EXCELLED IN SCULPTTTEE. %0a%0a%0a%0a321 %0a%0a%0a%0awith Pythodorus, of Polydeuces with Hermolaus, and of another %0aPythodorus with Artemon ; some of the statues, also, are by %0aAphrodisius of Tralles, who worked alone.

Pasi teles, 18 too, speaks in terms of %0ahigh admiration of them, the artist who wrote five Books on %0athe most celebrated works throughout the world. Born upon %0athe Grecian 19 shores of Italy, and presented with the Roman %0acitizenship granted to the cities of those parts, Pasiteles con- %0astructed the ivory statue of Jupiter which is now in the Temple %0aof Metellus, 20 on the road to the Campus Martius. It so hap- %0apened, that being one day at the Docks, 21 where there were %0asome wild beasts from Africa, while he was viewing through %0athe bars of a cage a lion which he was engaged in drawing, a %0apanther made its escape from another cage, to the no small %0adanger of this most careful artist.

Some are of opinion that these artists were %0avery wealthy men, and that they erected these buildings at %0atheir own expense, expecting to be allowed to inscribe their %0anames thereon ; but that, this indulgence being refused them, %0athey adopted another method of attaining their object. At %0aall events, there are still to be seen, at the present day, on the %0aspirals 27 of the columns, the figures of a lizard and a frog, 28 %0aemblematical of their names. In the Temple of Jupiter by %0athe same artists, the paintings, as well as all the other orna- %0aments, bear reference to the worship of a goddess. The 29 fact %0ais, that when the temple of Juno was completed, the porters, as %0ait is said, who were entrusted with the carriage of the statues, %0amade an exchange of them ; and, on religious grounds, the %0amistake was left uncorrected, from an impression that it had %0abeen by the intervention of the divinities themselves, that %0athis seat of worship had been thus shared between them. %0aHence it is that we see in the Temple of Juno, also, the orna- %0aments which properly pertain to the worship of Jupiter. %0a%0a22 See B. xxxv. c. 45. %0a%0a23 In the Ninth Region of the City.

(6.) AT WHAT PERIOD MARBLE WAS FIRST USED IN %0a%0aBUILDINGS. %0a%0aThis must suffice for the sculptors in marble, and the works %0athat have gained the highest repute ; with reference to which %0asubject it occurs to me to remark, that spotted marbles were not %0athen in fashion. In making their statues, these artists used the %0amarble of Thasos also, 32 one of the Cyclades, and of Lesbos, this %0alast being rather more livid than the other. The poet Menander, %0ain fact, who was a very careful enquirer into all matters of %0aluxury, is the first who has spoken, and that but rarely, of va- %0ariegated marbles, and, indeed, of the employment of marble in %0ageneral. Columns of this material were at first employed in %0atemples, not on grounds of superior elegance, (for that was not %0athought of, as yet), but because no material could be found of %0aa more substantial nature. It was under these circumstances, %0athat the Temple 33 of the Olympian Jupiter was commenced at %0aAthens, the columns of which were brought by Sylla to Rome, %0afor the buildings in the Capitol. %0a%0aStill, however, there had been a distinction drawn between %0aordinary stone and marble, in the days of Homer even.

Variegated marbles, in my opinion, were first dis- %0acovered in the quarries of Chios, when the inhabitants were %0abuilding the walls of their city ; a circumstance which gave %0arise to a facetious repartee on the part of M.

The most ancient instance of this practice, so far as I %0aknow of, is found in the palace of Mausolus, at Halicarnassus, %0athe walls of which, in brick, are covered with marble of Pro- %0aconnesus. Mausolus died in the second year of the hundred %0aand seventh 39 Olympiad, being the year of Rome, 403. %0a%0aCHAP. 7. — WHO WAS THE FIRST TO ENCRUST THE WALLS OF HOCSES %0aAT ROME WITH MARBLE. %0a%0aThe first person at Rome who covered the whole of the walls %0aof his house with marble, according to Cornelius Nepos, 40 was %0aMamurra, 41 who dwelt upon the Cselian Hill, a member of the %0aequestrian order, and a native of Formise, who had been pre- %0afect of the engineers under C. Caesar in Gaul. Such was the %0aindividual, that nothing may be wanting to the indignity %0aof the example, who first adopted this practice ; the same %0aMamurra, in fact, who has been so torn to pieces in the verses %0aof Catullus of Verona. Indeed, his own house proclaimed %0amore loudly than Catullus could proclaim it, that he had come %0ainto possession of all that Gallia Comata had had to possess. %0a%0a36 This is generally explained as meaning ordinary stone, but covered %0awith elaborate paintings, as was then the practice in the magnificent villas %0athat were built at Tibur, the modem Tivoli. See, however, Chapter 48, %0aand Note 36. %0a%0a31 As applied to the decorations of the walls of bouses. %0a%0a39 This date does not agree with that given to Scopas, one of the artists %0awho worked at the Mausoleum, in the early part of B. xxxiv. c. 19. Sillig, %0ahowever, is inclined to think that there were two artists named Scopas, %0aand would thus account for the diversity of about seventv years between %0athe dates. 40 See end of B. ii. %0a%0a« Owing to the liberality of Caesar, he amassed great riches. He is %0arepeatedly attacked by Catullus (Carm. xxix., xliii., Mi.), and accused of %0aextortion, and other vices. Horace also speaks of him in terms of ridicule, %0aI Sat. 5, 37. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 9.J METHOD OF CUTTING MABBLE INTO SLABS. %0a%0a%0a%0a325 %0a%0a%0a%0aFor Nepos adds, as well, that lie was the first to have all the %0acolumns of his house made of nothing but solid marble, and %0athat, too, marble of Carystus 42 or of Luna. 43 %0a%0aCHAP. 8. AT WHAT TEBIOD THE VABIOUS KINDS OF MABBLE CAME %0a%0aINTO USE AT BOME. %0a%0aM. Lepidus, who was consul with Q. Catulus, was the %0afirst to have the lintels of his house made of Numidian marble, %0aa thing for which he was greatly censured : he was consul m %0athe year of Rome, 676. This is the earliest instance that I %0acan find of the introduction of Numidian marble ; not in the %0aform of pillars, however, or of slabs, as was the case with the %0amarble of Carystus, above-mentioned, but in blocks, and that %0atoo, for the comparatively ignoble purpose of making the %0athresholds of doors. Four years after this Lepidus, L. Lucul- %0alus was consul ; the same person who gave its name, it is %0avery evident, to the Lucullan marble ; for, taking a great fancy %0ato it, he introduced it at Rome. While other kinds of marble %0aare valued for their spots or their colours, this marble is en- %0atirely black. 46 It is found in the island of Melos, 46 and is %0apretty nearly the only marble that has taken its name from %0athe person who first introduced it. Among these personages, %0aScaurus, in my opinion, was the first to build a theatre with %0awalls of marble : but whether they were only coated with %0aslabs of marble or were made of solid blocks highly polished, %0asuch as we now see in the Temple of Jupiter Tonans, 47 in the %0aCapitol, I cannot exactly say : for, up to this period, I cannot %0afind any vestiges of the use of marble slabs in Italy. %0a%0aCHAP. 9. THE METHOD OF CUTTING MABBLE INTO SLABS. THE %0a%0aSAND USED IN CUTTING MAliBLE. %0a%0aBut whoever it was that first invented the art of thus cutting %0amarble, and so multiplying the appliances of luxury, he dis- %0aplayed considerable ingenuity, though to little purpose. This %0a%0a42 See B. iv. c. 21. 43 See Chapter 4 of this Book. %0a%0a45 The black marbles, Ajasson remarks, are comparatively rare. He is %0aof opinion that the colour of the Lucullan marble was the noir antique of %0athe French, and says that it is to be found at Bergamo, Carrara, Prato in %0aTuscany, and near Spa in Belgium. %0a%0a46 "Chios" is another reading. %0a%0a47 "Thundering Jupiter." This temple was built by Augustus. %0a%0a%0a%0a326 %0a%0a%0a%0aflint's natural history. %0a%0a%0a%0a[Book XXXVI. %0a%0a%0a%0adivision, though apparently effected by the aid of iron, is in %0areality effected by sand ; tne saw acting only by pressing upon %0athe sand within a very fine cleft in the stone, as it is moved %0ato and fro. %0a%0aThe 48 sand of Ethiopia is the most highly esteemed for this %0apurpose ; for, to add to the trouble that is entailed, we have %0ato send to ^Ethiopia for the purpose of preparing our marble — %0aaye, and as far as India even ; whereas in former times, the %0aseverity of the Roman manners thought it beneath them to %0arepair thither in search of such costly things even as pearls ! %0aThis Indian sand is held in the next highest degree of esti- %0amation, the ^Ethiopian being of a softer nature, and better %0aadapted for dividing the stone without leaving any roughness %0aon the surface ; whereas the sand from India does not leave so %0asmooth a face upon it. Still, however, for polishing marble, %0awe find it recommended 19 to rub it with Indian sand calcined. %0aThe sand of Naxos has the same defect ; as also that from %0aCoptos, generally known as " Egyptian" sand. %0a%0aThe above were the several varieties of sand used by the %0aancients in dividing marble. More recently, a sand has been %0adiscovered that is equally approved of for this purpose ; in a %0acertain creek of the Adriatic Sea, which is left dry at low %0awater only ; a thing that renders it not very easy to be found. %0aAt the present day, however, the fraudulent tendencies of our %0aworkers in marble have emboldened them to use any kind of %0ariver-sand for the purpose ; a mischief which very few em- %0aployers rightly appreciate. For, the coarser the sand, the %0awider is the division made in the stone, the greater the quan- %0atity of material consumed, and the more extensive the labour %0arequired for polishing the rough surface that is left ; a result %0aof which is that the slabs lose so much more in thickness. %0aFor giving the last polish to marble, 50 Thebaic stone 51 is con- %0asidered well adapted, as also porous stone, or pumice, powdered %0afine. %0a%0a49 Ajasson says that his remarks on the choice of the sand for this pur- %0apose, are very judicious. %0a%0a49 A recommendation worse than useless, Ajasson remarks. %0a%0a50 For this purpose, at the present day. granular corindon, or yellow %0aemery, is used, as also a mixture composed of the oxides of lead 'and of %0atin ; the suhstance heing repeatedly moistened when applied. %0a%0a31 See Chapters 13 and 43 of this Look. %0a%0a%0a%0aChop. 11.] THE MARBLKS OF ALEXANDRIA. %0a%0a%0a%0a327 %0a%0a%0a%0aCHAP. 10. (7.) STONE OF NAXOS. STONE OF ARMENIA. %0a%0aFor polishing marble statues, as also for cutting and giving %0aa polish to precious stones, the preference was long given to %0athe stone of Naxos, 52 such being the name of a kind of touch- %0astone 53 that is found in the Isle of Cyprus. More recently, %0ahowever, the stones imported from Armenia for this purpose %0ahave displaced those of Naxos. %0a%0aCHAP 11. THE MARBLES OF ALEXANDRIA. %0a%0aThe marbles are too well known to make it necessary for %0ame to enumerate their several colours and varieties ; and, %0aindeed, so numerous are they, that it would be no easy task to %0ado so. For what place is there, in fact, that has not a marble %0aof its own ? In addition to which, in our description of the %0aearth and its various peoples, 64 we have already made it our %0acare to mention the more celebrated kinds of marble. Still, %0ahowever, they are not all of them produced from quarries, but %0ain many instances lie scattered just beneath the surface of the %0aearth ; some of them the most precious even, the green Lace- %0adaemonian marble, for example, more brilliant in colour than %0aany other; the Augustan also; and, more recently, the Tiberian ; %0awhich were first discovered, in the reigns respectively of %0aAugustus and Tiberius, in Egypt. These two marbles differ %0afrom ophites 55 in the circumstance that the latter is marked %0awith streaks which resemble serpents 56 in appearance, whence %0aits name. There is also this difference between the two %0amarbles themselves, in the arrangement of their spots : the %0aAugustan marble has them undulated and curling to a point; %0awhereas in the Tiberian the streaks are white, 57 not involved, %0abut lying wide asunder. %0a%0aOf ophites, there are only some very small pillars known to %0ahave been made. There are two varieties of it, one white %0aand soft, the other inclining to black, and hard. Both kinds, %0ait is said, worn as an amulet, are a cure for head-ache, and for %0a%0a62 A city in Crete where the stone was prepared for use. 53 " Cotes." %0a54 Books III. IV.

As a %0acounter-poison to serpents, some persons speak more particu- %0alarly in praise of the ophites that is known as " tephrias,"" %0afrom its ashy colour. There is also a marble known as %0a"memphites," from the place 60 where it is found, and of a %0anature somewhat analogous to the precious stones. For medi- %0acinal purposes, it is triturated and applied in the form of a %0aliniment, with vinegar, to such parts of the body as require %0acauterizing or incision ; the flesh becoming quite benumbed, %0aand thereby rendered insensible to pain. %0a%0aPorphyrites, 61 which is another production of Egypt, is of a %0ared colour : the kind that is mottled with white blotches is %0aknown as " leptospsephos." 62 The quarries there are able to %0afurnish blocks 63 of any dimensions, however large. Vitrasius %0aPollio, who was steward 64 in Egypt for the Emperor Claudius, %0abrought to Rome from Egypt some statues made of this stone ; %0aa novelty which was not very highly approved of, as no one %0ahas since followed his example. The Egyptians, too, have %0adiscovered in ^Ethiopia the stone known as " basanites ;" 65 %0awhich in colour and hardness resembles iron, whence the %0aname 66 that has been given to it. A larger block of it has %0anever been known than the one forming the group which has %0abeen dedicated by the Emperor Vespasianus Augustus in the %0aTemple of Peace. It represents the river Nilus with sixteen %0achildren sporting around it, 67 symbolical of the sixteen cubits, %0athe extreme height 68 to which, in the most favourable seasons, %0athat river should rise. It is stated, too, that in the Temple %0aof Serapis at Thebes, there is a block not unlike it, which %0aforms the statue of Memnon 69 there ; remarkable, it is said, for %0a%0a58 A superstition, owing solely to the name and appearance of the stone. %0a%0a59 From the Greek Ttfpa, " ashes."

ONYX AND ALABASTRITES ; SIX REMEDIES. %0a%0aOur forefathers imagined that onyx 70 was only to be %0afound iu the mountains of Arabia, and nowhere else ; but %0aSudines 71 was aware that it is also found in Carmania. 72 %0aDrinking- vessels were made of it at first, and then the feet of %0abeds and chairs. Cornelius Nepos relates that great was the %0aastonishment, when P. Lentulus Spinther exhibited amphorae %0amade of this material, as large as Chian wine-vessels in %0asize ; " and yet, five years after," says he, "I saw columns of %0athis material, no less than two-and-thirty feet in height." At %0aa more recent period again, some change took place 73 with %0areference to this stone ; for four 74 small pillars of it were %0aerected by Cornelius Balbus in his Theatre 75 as something %0aquite marvellous : and I myself have seen thirty columns, of %0alarger size, in the banquetting-room which Callistus 76 erected, %0athe freedman of Claudius, so well known for the influence %0awhich he possessed. %0a%0a(8.) This 76 * stone is called " alabastrites" 17 by some, and is %0ahollowed out into vessels for holding unguents, it having the %0areputation of preserving them from corruption 18 better than %0aanything else. In a calcined state, it is a good ingredient for %0a%0aposed that it represented a monarch of the second dynasty. This is pro- %0abably the statue still to be seen at Medinet Abou, on the Libyan side of %0athe Nile, in a sitting posture, and at least 60 feet in height. The legs, %0aarms, and other parts of the body are covered with inscriptions, which ' %0aattest that, in the third century of the Christian era, the priests still prac- %0atised upon the credulity of the devotees, by pretending that it emitted %0asounds. It may possibly have been erected for astronomical purposes, or %0afor the mystic worship of the sun. The Greek name " Memnon" is sup- %0aposed to have been derived from the Egyptian Mei Amun, "beloved of %0aAmnion." %0a%0a70 Ajasson remarks that under this name the ancients meant, first, yellow %0acalcareous Alabaster, and secondly, Chalcedony, unclassified. %0a%0a71 See end of the present Book. 72 See B. vi. cc. 27, 23, 32. %0a%0a73 ii Variatum est." %0a%0a74 Ajasson thinks that these columns, in reality, were made, in both %0ainstances, of yellow jasper, or else yellow sardonyx, a compound of sard %0aand chalcedony. 75 Erected a.u.c. 741. 76 See B. xxxiii. c. 47. %0a%0a76> The reading here is doubtful, and it is questionable whether he con- %0asiders the two stones as identical. %0a~>i Probably calcareous Alabaster, Ajasson thinks.

The most esteemed kind, however, is that of Car- %0amania, the next being the produce of India, and then, those of %0aSyria and Asia. The worst in quality is that of Cappadocia, %0ait being utterly destitute of lustre. That which is of a honey %0acolour is the most esteemed, covered with spots curling in %0awhirls, 80 and not transparent. Alabastrites is considered de- %0afective, when it is of a white or horn colour, or approaching %0ato glass in appearance. %0a%0aCHAP. 13. LYGDINTJS; CORALLITIC STONE; STONE OF ALABANDA; %0a%0aSTONE OF TUKBAIS ; STONE OF STEiS E. %0a%0aLittle inferior to it for the preservation of unguents, in the %0aopinion of many, is the stone, called " lygdinus," 81 that is %0afound in Paros," and never of a larger size than to admit of a %0adish or goblet being made of it. In former times, it was only %0aimported from Arabia, being remarkable for its extreme %0awhiteness. %0a%0aGreat value is placed also upon two other kinds of stone, of %0aquite a contrary nature ; corallitic 8 ' stone, found in Asia, in blocks %0anot more than two cubits in thickness, and of a white some- %0awhat approaching that of ivory, and in some degree resembling %0ait ; and Alabandic stone, which, on the other hand, is black, %0aand is so called from the district 83 which produces it : though %0a%0a79 Plaster of Paris is made of gypsum or alabaster, heated and ground. %0a%0a80 A feature both of jasper and of sardonyx. %0a%0a81 By some persons it has been considered to be the same with the " lych- %0anitis," or white marble, mentioned in Chapter 4 of this Book. Ajasson %0ais of opinion that it has not been identified. %0a%0a83 Ajasson is in doubt whether this stone was really a marble or agypsic %0aalabaster. It received its name from the river Curalius or Coural, near %0awhich it was found ; and it was also known as Sangaric marble. Ajasson %0athinks that the ancient milk-white marble, still found in Italy, and known %0ato the dealers in antiquities as Palombino, may have been the " corallitic" %0astone. He also mentions the fine white marble known as Grechetto. %0a%0a83 See B. v. c. 29. Sulphuret of manganese is now known as Alaban- %0adine ; it is black, but becomes of a tarnished brown on exposure to the %0aair. It is not improbable that this manganese was used for colouring %0aglass, and that in Chapter 66 of this Book Pliny again refers to manganese %0awhen speaking of a kind of " magnet" or load-stone. See Beckmann, %0aHist. lnv. Vol. II. pp. 237—8, Bohn's Edition ; who thinks, that %0ain the present passage Pliny is speaking of a kind of marble. It is %0athe fact, however, that Pyrolusite, or grey ore of manganese, is used, at a %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 14.] %0a%0a%0a%0aOBELISKS. %0a%0a%0a%0a331 %0a%0a%0a%0ait is also to be found at Miletus, "where, however, it verges %0asomewhat more upon the purple.

In the neigh- %0abourhood of Syene, too, in Thebais, there is a stone found %0athat is now known as "syenites," 85 but was formerly called %0a" pyrrhopoecilon." 86 %0a%0aCHAP. 14. OBELISKS. %0a%0aMonarchs, too, have entered into a sort of rivalry with one %0aanother in forming elongated blocks of this stone, known as %0a" obelisks," 87 and consecrated to the divinity of the Sun. %0aThe blocks had this form given to them in resemblance to %0athe rays of that luminary, which are so called 88 in the Egyp- %0atian language. %0a%0aMesphres, 89 who reigned in the City of the Sun, 90 was the %0afirst who erected one of these obelisks, being warned to do so %0ain a dream : indeed, there is an inscription upon the obelisk to %0athis effect; for the sculptures and figures which we still see %0aengraved thereon are no other than Egyptian letters. 91 %0a%0aAt a later period other kings had these obelisks hewn. %0aSesosthes 9 * erected four of them in the above-named city, %0aforty-eight cubits in height.

Having quitted the spot %0awhere the palace of Mnevis 94 stood, this monarch erected %0aanother obelisk, 95 one hundred and twenty cubits in height, %0abut of prodigious thickness, the sides being no less than %0aeleven cubits in breadth. (9.) It is said that one hundred %0aand twenty thousand men were employed upon this work ; M %0aand that the king, when it was on the point of being elevated, %0abeing apprehensive that the machinery employed might not %0aprove strong enough for the weight, with the view of increas- %0aing the peril that might be entailed by due want of precaution %0aon the part of the workmen, had his own son fastened to the %0asummit ; in order that the safety of the prince might at the %0asame time ensure the safety of the mass of stone. It was in his %0aadmiration of this work, that, when King Cambyses took the %0acity by storm, and the conflagration had already reached the %0avery foot of the obelisk, he ordered the fire to be extinguished ; %0ahe entertaining a respect for this stupendous erection which %0ahe had not entertained for the city itself. %0a%0aThere are also two other obelisks, one of them erected by %0aZmarres, 96 and the other by Phius; 97 both of them without %0ainscriptions, and forty-eight cubits in height. Ptolemteus %0aPhiladelphia had one erected at Alexandria, eighty cubits %0ahigh, which had been prepared by order of King Necthebis :** %0ait was without any inscription, and cost far more trouble in %0aits carriage and elevation, than had been originally expended %0ain quarrying it. Some writers inform us that it was con- %0aveyed on a raft, under the inspection of the architect Satyrus ; %0abut Callixenus" gives the name of Phcenix.

One reading is " Erapb," and Har- %0adouin attempts to identify him with the Pharaoh Hophra of Jeremiah, xliv. %0a30, the Ouafres of the Chronicle of Eusebius, and the Aprirs of Herodotus. %0a%0a98 The Nectanabis, probably, of Plutarch, in his Life of Agesilaus, and %0athe Nectanebus of Nepos, in the Life of Chabrias. %0a%0a99 Callixenus of Rhodes was a contemporary of Ptolemy Philadelphus, %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 14.] %0a%0a%0a%0aOBELISKS. %0a%0a%0a%0a333 %0a%0a%0a%0apose, a canal was dug from the river Nilus to the spot where %0athe obelisk lay ; and two broad vessels, laden with blocks of %0asimilar stone a foot square, the cargo of each amounting to %0adouble the size, and consequently double the weight, of the %0aobelisk, were brought beneath it ; the extremities of the %0aobelisk remaining supported by the opposite sides of the canal. %0aThe blocks of stone were then removed, and the vessels, being %0athus gradually lightened, received their burden. It was %0aerected upon a basis of six square blocks, quarried from the %0asame mountain, and the artist was rewarded with the sum of %0afifty talents. 1 This obelisk was placed by the king above- %0amentioned in the Arsinooeum, 2 in testimony of his affection for %0ahis wife and sister Arsinoe. At a later period, as it was found %0ato be an inconvenience to the docks, Maximus, the then prasfect %0aof Egypt, had it transferred to the Forum there, after removing %0athe summit for the purpose of substituting a gilded point ; an %0aintention which was ultimately abandoned. %0a%0aThere are two other obelisks, which were in Caesar's Temple %0aat Alexandria, near the harbour there, forty-two cubits in %0aheight, and originally hewn by order of King Mesphres. But %0athe most difficult enterprise of all, was the carriage of these %0aobelisks by sea to Borne, in vessels which excited the greatest %0aadmiration. Indeed, the late Emperor Augustus consecrated %0athe one wnich brought over the first obelisk, as a lasting %0amemorial of this marvellous undertaking, in the docks at %0aPuteoli ; but it was destroyed by fire. As to the one in which, %0aby order of the Emperor Caius, 3 the other obelisk had been %0atransported to Rome, after having been preserved for some %0ayears and looked upon as the most wonderful construction ever %0abeheld upon the seas, it was brought to Ostia, by order of the %0alate Emperor Claudius ; and towers of Puteolan 4 earth being %0afirst erected upon it, it was sunk for the construction of the %0aharbour which he was making there.

It is eighty-five feet 8 and three quarters in height, %0aexclusive of the base, which is a part of the same stone.

(10.) — THE OBELISK WHICH SE11VES AS A DIAL IN I II K %0aCAMPUS MAKTIUS. %0a%0aThe one that has been erected in the Campus Martius 9 has %0abeen applied to a singular purpose by the late Emperor %0aAugustus ; that of marking the shadows projected by the sun, %0aand so measuring the length of the days and nights. With this %0aobject, a stone pavement was laid, the extreme length of %0awhich corresponded exactly with the length of the shadow %0athrown by the obelisk at the sixth hour 10 on the day of the winter %0asolstice. After this period, the shadow would go on, day by %0ada}-, gradually decreasing, and then again 11 would as gradually %0aincrease, correspondingly with certain lines of brass that were %0ainserted in the stone ; a device well deserving to be known, %0aand due to the ingenuity of Facundus Novus, the mathema- %0atician. Upon the apex of the obelisk he placed a gilded %0aball, in order that the shadow of the summit might be con- %0a%0a5 Or Circus Maximus ; in the Eleventh Region of the City. Accord- %0aing to Kircher, it was this obelisk that Pope Sextus V. had disinterred, %0aand placed hefore the church of the Madonna del Popolo. %0a%0a6 There are sixteen various readings to this name. %0a%0a7 Diogenes Laertius says that he arrived in Egypt in the reign of King %0aAmasis. %0a%0a8 Boscovich and Brotero would read here "eighty-two feet and three %0aquarters," which is more in accordance with its height, as measured hy %0aKircher. %0a%0a9 After being long buried in ruins, it was disinterred, hut not re-erected, %0aby Pope Benedict XIV. When thus brought to light, it was found to be %0abroken asunder. On it there was an inscription stating that the Emperor %0aAugustus had " presented it to the Sun" — " Soli donum dedit." %0a%0a10 Twelve o'clock in the day. » After the summer solstice. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 16.] %0a%0a%0a%0aMARVELLOUS WORKS IN EGIl'T. %0a%0a%0a%0a335 %0a%0a%0a%0adensed and agglomerated, and so prevent the shadow of the %0aapex itself from running to a fine point of enormous extent ; %0athe plan being first suggested to him, it is said, by the shadow- %0athat is projected by the human head.

They lie between %0athe city of Memphis and what we have mentioned 23 as the %0aDelta, within four miles of the river, and seven miles and %0aa-half from Memphis, near a village known as Busiris, the %0apeople of which are in the habit of ascending them. %0a%0aCHAP. 17.

It is their belief that King Harmais was %0aburied in it, and they will have it that it was brought there %0afrom a distance.

These authors, however, are disagreed as to the persons %0aby whom they were constructed ; accident having, with very- %0aconsiderable justice, consigned to oblivion the names of those %0awho erected such stupendous memorials of their vanity. Some %0aof these writers inform us that fifteen hundred talents were %0aexpended upon radishes, garlic, and onions 38 alone. %0a%0aThe largest Pyramid occupies seven 29 jugera of ground, and %0athe four angles are equidistant, the face of each side being eight %0ahundred and thirty-three 30 feet in length. The total height %0afrom the ground to the summit is seven hundred and twenty- %0afive feet, and the platform on the summit is sixteen feet and %0aa-half in circuit. Of the second Pyramid, the faces of the four %0asides are each seven hundred and fifty-seven feet and a-half in %0alength. 31 The third is smaller than the others, but far more %0aprepossessing in appearance : it is built of ^Ethiopian stone, 32 %0a%0a25 This reading is, perhaps, preferable to the LXI. s, (61|) of the Bam- %0aberg MS. The head and neck, when uncovered, were found to be 27 feet %0ain height. %0a%0a26 Built by King Cheops, according to Herodotus, B. ii. %0a%0a27 All these writers are mentioned in the list of authors at the end of %0athe present Book. %0a%0aM For the use of the workmen. There is, probably, no foundation for %0aa statement so exact as this ; as it would be very singular that such a fact %0ashould continue to be known, and the names of the builders be buried in %0aoblivion. %0a%0a29 According to modern measurement, the sides of its base measure at %0athe foundation 763 feet 4 inches, and it occupies a 6pace of more than 13 %0aacres. Its perpendicular height is 480 feet. %0a%0a30 Otb€r readings are 883, and 783. %0a%0aM Differing very considerably from the modern measurement. These %0avariations may possibly arise, however, from a large portion of the base %0abeing covered with sand. %0a%0a32 It was entirely coated with marble from the Tbebaid ; which, how- %0aever, was removed by the Arabs in the middle ages. In the vicinity there %0a%0aVOL. VI.

In the vicinity of these erections, %0athere are no vestiges of any buildings left. Far and -wide %0athere Is nothing but sand to be seen, of a grain somewhat like %0aa lentil in appearance, similar to that of the greater part of %0aAfrica, in fact. %0a%0aThe most difficult problem is, to know how the materials %0afor construction could possibly be carried to so vast a height. %0aAccording to some authorities, as the building gradually ad- %0avanced, they heaped up against it vast mounds of nitre 33 and %0asalt ; which piles were melted after its completion, by intro- %0aducing beneath them the waters of the river. Others, again, %0amaintain, that bridges were constructed, of bricks of clay, and %0athat, when the pyramid was completed, these bricks were dis- %0atributed for erecting the houses of private individuals. For 11 %0athe level of the river, they say, being so much lower, water %0acould never by any possibility have been brought there by the %0amedium of canals. In the interior of the largest Pyramid %0athere is a well, eighty-six cubits deep, which communicates %0awith the river, it is thought. The method of ascertaining the %0aheight of the Pyramids and all similar edifices was discovered 35 %0aby Thales of Miletus ; he measuring the shadow at the hour of %0athe day at which it is equal in length to the body projecting it. %0a%0aSuch are the marvellous Pyramids ; but the crowning marvel %0aof all is, that the smallest, but most admired of them — that we %0amay feel no surprise at the opulence of the kings — was built by %0aEhodopis, 36 a courtesan ! This woman was once the fellow- %0aslave of JEsopus the philosopher and fabulist, and the sharer %0a%0ais a fourth pyramid, but of such small dimensions that some of the Egyp- %0atian obelisks exceed it in height. %0a%0a33 " Nitrum." See B. xxxi. c. 46. %0a%0a34 From this reason being given, it would almost appear that these %0a" bridges" in reality were aqueducts, for conveying the water, in order to %0amelt the mounds of salt and nitre. %0a%0a35 A very improbable story, as Ajasson remarks ; as if the method of %0aascertaining the heights of edifices was unknown to the sages of Egypt, %0aand the constructors of the Pyramids ! %0a%0a36 Herodotus, B. ii. cc. 134, 5, takes great pains to prove the absurdity %0aof this story ; and there is little doubt that the beautiful courtesan has been %0aconfounded with the equally beautiful Egyptian Queen, Nitocris, who is %0asaid by Julius Africanus and Eusebius to have built the third pyramid. %0aAs to the courtesan having been a fellow-slave of the fabulist, JSsop, it is %0aextremely doubtful. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 19.] %0a%0a%0a%0aLABYEINTHS. %0a%0a%0a%0a339 %0a%0a%0a%0aof his bed ; but what is much more surprising is, that a cour- %0atesan should have been enabled, by her vocation, to amass such %0aenormous wealth. %0a%0aCHAP. 18. — 'THE PHABOS. %0a%0aThere is another building, too, that is highly celebrated ; %0athe tower that was built by a king of Egypt, on the island of %0aPharos, at the entrance to the 37 harbour of Alexandria. The %0acost of its erection was eight hundred talents, they say ; and, %0anot to omit the magnanimity that was shown by King Ptole- %0amaeus 38 on this occasion, he gave permission to the architect, %0aSostratus 39 of Cnidos, to inscribe his name upon the edifice %0aitself. The object of it is, by the light of its fires at night, %0ato give warning to ships, of the neighbouring shoals, and to %0apoint out to them the entrance of the harbour. At the %0apresent day, there are similar fires lighted up in numerous %0aplaces, Ostia and Ravenna, for example. The only danger 10 %0ais, that when these fires are thus kept burning without inter- %0amission, they may be mistaken for stars, the flames having %0avery much that appearance at a distance.

As to the purpose for which it %0awas built, there are various opinions : Demoteles says that it %0awas the palace of King Moteris, and Lyceas that it was the tomb %0aof Moeris, while many others assert that it was a building %0aconsecrated to the Sun, an opinion which mostly prevails. %0a%0aThat Daedalus took this for the model of the Labyrinth %0awhich he constructed in Crete, there can be no doubt ; though %0ahe only reproduced the hundredth part of it, that portion, %0anamely, which encloses circuitous passages, windings, and %0ainextricable galleries which lead to and fro. We must not, %0acomparing this last to what we see delineated on our mosaic %0apavements, or to the mazes 43 formed in the fields for the %0aamusement of children, suppose it to be a narrow promenade %0aalong which we may walk for many miles together ; but we %0amust picture to ourselves a building filled with numerous %0adoors, and galleries which continually mislead the visitor, %0abringing him back, after all his wanderings, to the spot from %0awhich he first set out. This 44 Labyrinth is the second, that of %0aEgypt being the first. There is a third in the Isle of %0aLemnos, and a fourth in Italy. %0a%0aThey are all of them covered with arched roofs of polished %0astone ; at the entrance, too, of the Egyptian Labyrinth, a thing %0athat surprises me, the building is constructed of Parian marble, %0awhile throughout the other parts of it the columns are of %0asyenites. 45 With such solidity is this huge mass constructed, %0athat the lapse of ages has been totally unable to destroy it, %0aseconded as it has been by the people of Heracleopolites, who %0ahave marvellously ravaged a work which they have always %0aheld in abhorrence. To detail thfe position of this work and %0athe various portions of it is quite impossible, it being sub- %0a%0a43 Similar, probably, to the one at Hampton Court. %0a%0a41 Most modern writers, and some of the ancients, have altogether de- %0anied the existence of the Cretan Labyrinth ; but, judging from the testi- %0amony of Tournefort and Cockerell, it is most probable that it really did %0aexist, and that it was a vast natural grotto or cavern, enlarged and made %0aadditionally intricate by human ingenuity. There are many caverns of %0athis nature in Crete, and one near Gortyna, at Hagios-Deka, is replete with %0agalleries and intricate windings similar to those ascribed to the Labyrinth %0aof Dsedalus. %0a%0a45 See Chapter 13 of this Book. He is surprised that the people of %0aEgypt, a country which abounded in exquisite marbles, should have used %0athat of another country in preference to their own. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 19.] %0a%0a%0a%0aLA.BYBINTHS. %0a%0a%0a%0a341 %0a%0a%0a%0adivided into regions and prefectures, which are styled nomes, 46 %0athirty in number, with a vast palace assigned to each. In %0aaddition to these, it should contain temples of all the gods of %0aEgypt, and forty statues of Nemesis 47 in as many sacred %0ashrines ; besides numerous pyramids, forty ells 48 in height, and %0acovering six arurse 49 at the base. Fatigued with wandering %0ato and fro, the visitor is sure to arrive at some inextricable %0acrossing or other of the galleries. And then, too, there are %0abanquetting rooms situate at the summit of steep ascents; %0aporticos from which we descend by flights of ninety steps ; %0acolumns in the interior, made of porphyrites ; M figures of gods ; %0astatues of kings ; and effigies of hideous monsters. Some of %0athe palaces are so peculiarly constructed, that the moment the %0adoors are opened a dreadful sound like that of thunder rever- %0aberates within : the greater part, too, of these edifices have to be %0atraversed in total darkness. Then again, without the walls of %0athe Labyrinth, there rises another mass of buildings known as %0athe " Pteron ;" 51 beneath which there are passages excavated %0aleading to other subterranean palaces. One person, and only %0aone, has made some slight repairs to the Labyrinth ; Chsere- %0amon, 62 an eunuch of King Necthebis, who lived five hundred %0ayears before the time of Alexander the Great. It is asserted, %0aalso, that while the arched roofs of squared stone were being %0araised, he had them supported by beams of thorn 53 boiled %0ain oil. %0a%0aAs for the Cretan Labyrinth, what I have already stated %0amust suffice for that.

But %0aas the fabulousness of the story connected with it quite ex- %0aceeds all bounds, I shall employ the words given by M. Varro %0ahimself in his account of it : — " Porsena was buried," says he, %0a" beneath the city of Clusium f in the spot where he had had %0aconstructed a square monument, built of squared stone. Each %0aside of this monument was three hundred feet in length and %0afifty in height, and beneath the base, which was also square, %0athere was an inextricable labyrinth, into which if any one %0aentered without a clew of thread, he could never find his way %0aout. Above this square building there stand five pyramids, %0aone at each corner, and one in the middle, seventy-five feet %0abroad at the base, and one hundred and fifty feet in height. %0aThese pyramids are so tapering in their form, that upon the %0asummit of all of them united there rests a brazen globe, and %0aupon that a petasus ; 58 from which there hang, suspended by %0achains, bells, which make a tinkling when agitated by the %0awind, like what was done at Dodona 69 in former times. Upon %0athis globe there are four other pyramids, each one hundred %0afeet in height ; and above them is a single platform, on which %0athere are five more pyramids," 60 — the height of which Varro has %0aevidently felt ashamed to add ; but, according to the Etruscan %0afables, it was equal to that of the rest of the building. What %0a%0a55 Smilis lived, probably, 200 years before Rhoecus and Theodorus, and %0awas a native of iEgina, not Lemnos. Sillig, however, is inclined to think %0athat there were two artists of this name ; the elder a contemporary of %0aDaedalus, and the maker of several wooden statues. %0a%0a66 See B. xzxv. c. 43. « See B. iii. c. 8. %0a%0a58 A round, broad-brimmed hat, such as we see represented in the sta- %0atues of Mercury. %0a%0a59 Where two brazen vessels were erected on a column, adjoining to %0awhich was the statue of a boy with a whip ; which, when agitated by the %0awind, struck the vessels, and omens were drawn from the tinkling noise %0aproduced, significant of future events, it was supposed. %0a%0a60 A buildiBg like this, as Niebuhr says, is absolutely impossible, and %0abelongs to the " Arabian Nights."

(14.) — THE TEMPLE OF DIANA AT EFHESUS. %0a%0aThe most wonderful monument of Graecian magnificence, %0aand one that merits our genuine admiration, is the Temple of %0aDiana at Ephesus, which took one hundred and twenty years %0ain building, a work in which all Asia 63 joined. A marshy soil %0awas selected for its site, in order that it might not suffer from %0aearthquakes, or the chasms which they produce. On the %0aother hand, again, that the foundations of so vast a pile might %0anot have to rest upon a loose and shifting bed, layers of trodden %0acharcoal were placed beneath, with fleeces 61 covered with wool %0aupon the top of them. The entire length of the temple is %0afour hundred and twenty-five feet, and the breadth two hun- %0adred and twenty-five. The columns are one hundred and %0atwenty-seven in number, and sixty feet in height, each of %0athem presented by a different king. Thirty-six of these %0acolumns are carved, and one of them by the hand of Scopas. 65 %0aChersiphron 66 was the architect who presided over the work. %0a%0a61 Probably of Babylon, which were built on terraces raised on arches. %0a%0a62 His meaning is, that it was built upon arches. 63 Asia Minor. %0a%0a64 The Hotel de Ville at Brussels is said to have been built upon a %0astratum of hides. ... A . %0a%0a« See Chapter 4 of the present Book. Silhg, in his " Dictionary of %0aAncient Artists," suggests a reading which would make the passage to %0amean that Scopas was jointly architect with Chersiphron. The latter, how- %0aever, was not the architect of the second temple at Ephesus, but flourished %0anearly four hundred years before. %0a%0a66 Strabosays that, in conjunction with his son Metagenes.he began the %0afirst Temple at Ephesus.

[Book XXXVI. %0a%0a%0a%0aThe great marvel in this building is, how such ponderous %0aarchitraves 67 could possibly have been raised to so great a %0aheight. This, however, the architect effected by means of %0abags filled with sand, which he piled up upon an inclined %0aplane until they reached beyond the capitals of the columns ; %0athen, as he gradually emptied the lower bags, the architraves 68 %0ainsensibly settled in the places assigned them. But the %0agreatest difficulty of all was found, in laying the lintel which %0ahe placed over the entrance-doors. It was an enormous mass %0aof stone, and by no possibility could it be brought to lie level %0aupon the jambs which formed its bed ; in consequence of %0awhich, the architect was driven to such a state of anxiety and %0adesperation as to contemplate suicide. Wearied and quite %0aworn out by such thoughts as these, during the night, they %0asay, he beheld in a dream the goddess in honour of whom the %0atemple was being erected ; who exhorted him to live on, for %0athat she herself had placed the stone in its proper position. %0aAnd such, in fact, next morning, was found to be the case, %0athe stone apparently having come to the proper level by dint %0aof its own weight. The other decorations of this work would %0asuffice to fill many volumes, but they do not tend in any way %0ato illustrate the works of Nature. %0a%0aCHAP. 22. (15.) — MARVELS CONNECTED WITH OTHER TEMPLES. %0a%0aThere still exists, too, at Cyzicus, 89 a temple of polished %0astone, between all the joints of which the artist has inserted a %0athread of gold ; it being his intention to erect an ivory statue %0aof Jupiter within, with Apollo in marble crowning him. The %0aresult is, that the interstices quite glisten with their fine, %0ahair-like threads ; and the reflection of the gold, obscured as it %0ais, gently falling upon the statues, besides proclaiming the %0agenius of the artist, heightens their effect, and so teaches us %0ato appreciate the costliness of the work. %0a%0aCHAP. 23. — THE FUGITIVE STONE.

See B. xxxv. c. 49. %0a%0a68 Which must have been above the bags and at the summit of the in- %0aclined plane. « See B. v. c. 40. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 24 ] MARVELLOUS BUILDINGS AT HOME. %0a%0a%0a%0a345 %0a%0a%0a%0ative Stone ;" 70 the Argonautae, who used it for the purposes of %0aan anchor, having left it there. This stone having repeatedly- %0ataken flight from the Prytanseum, 71 the place so called where %0ait is kept, it has been fastened down with lead. In this %0acity also, near the gate which is known as the " Trachia," 72 %0athere are seven towers, which repeat a number of times all %0asounds that are uttered in them. This phenomenon, to which %0athe name of " Echo," has been given by the Greeks, depends %0aupon the peculiar conformation of localities, and is • produced %0ain valleys more particularly. At Cyzicus, however, it is the %0aeffect of accident only ; while at Olympia, it is produced by %0aartificial means, and in a very marvellous manner ; in a portico %0athere, which is known as the " Heptaphonon," 74 from the cir- %0acumstance that it returns the sound of the voice seven times. %0a%0aAt Cyzicus, also, is the Buleuterium, 74 a vast edifice, con- %0astructed without a nail of iron ; the raftering being so con- %0atrived as to admit of the beams being removed and replaced %0awithout the use of stays. A similar thing, too, is the case %0awith the Sublician Bridge 75 at Borne ; and this by enactment, %0aon religious grounds, there having been such difficulty experi- %0aenced in breaking it down when Horatius Codes 75 * defended it. %0a%0aCHAP. 24.

In later times it was also known as the %0aPons iEmilius, from the name of the person probably under whose super- %0aintendence it was rebuilt.

[Book XXXVI. %0a%0a%0a%0athe world has been outdone by us : a thing which will appear, %0ain fact, to have occurred almost as many times as the marvels %0aare in number which I shall have to enumerate. It, in- %0adeed, all the buildings of our City are considered in the aggre- %0agate, and supposing them, so to say, all thrown together in one %0avast mass, the united grandeur of them would lead one to %0asuppose that we were describing another world, accumulated %0ain a single spot. . %0a%0aNot to mention among our great works, the Circus Maxi- %0amus, that was constructed by the Dictator Czesar, one stadium %0ain width and three in length, and occupying, with the ad- %0ajacent buildings, no less than four jugera, with room for two %0ahundred and sixty thousand spectators seated ; am I not to %0ainclude in the number of our magnificent constructions, the %0aBasilica of Paulus, 76 with its admirable Phrygian columns ; the %0aForum of the late Emperor Augustus ; the Temple of Peace, %0aereeted by the Emperor Vespasianus Augustus — some of the %0afinest works that the world has ever beheld — the roofing, %0atoo, of the Vote-Office," that was built by Agrippa ? not to %0aforget that, before his time, Valerius of Ostia, the architect, %0ahad covered in a theatre at Rome, at the time of the public %0aGames celebrated by Libo ? 78 %0a%0a"We behold with admiration pyramids that were built by %0akings, when the very ground alone, that was purchased by the %0aDictator Caesar, for the construction of his Forum, cost one %0ahundred millions of sesterces ! If, too, an enormous expendi- %0ature has its attractions for any one whose mind is influenced %0aby monetary considerations, be it known to him that the house %0ain which Clodius dwelt, who was slain by Milo, was purchased %0aby him at the price of fourteen million eight hundred thou- %0asand sesterces ! a thing that, for my part, I look upon as no %0aless astounding than the monstrous follies that have been dis- %0aplayed by kings. And then, as to Milo himself, the sums in %0awhich he was indebted, amounted to no less than seventy mil- %0a%0a76 L. JSmilius Paulus, who was consul with C. Marcellus, A.u.c. 703. %0aHis Basilica, a building wliich served as a court of law and as an ex- %0achange, was erected in the Eighth Region of the City, at the cost of 1500 %0atalents ; which were sent to him by Caesar, Plutarch says, as a bribe to %0again him over from the aristocratical party. It was surrounded with an %0aopen peristyle of columns of Phrygian marble. %0a%0a77 " Diribitorium."

But it was in those days, too, that %0aold men still spoke in admiration of the vast proportions of %0athe Agger, 79 and of the enormous foundations of the Capitol ; %0aof the public sewers, too, a work more stupendous than any ; %0aas mountains had to be pierced for their construction, and, %0alike the hanging city 80 which we recently mentioned, navi- %0agation had to be carried on beneath Rome ; an event which %0ahappened in the aedileship 81 of M. Agrippa, after he had filled %0ar the office of consul. %0a%0aFor this purpose, there are seven rivers, made, by artificial Y %0achannels, to flow beneath the city. Rushing onward, like so %0amany impetuous torrents, they are compelled to carry off and %0asweep away all the sewerage ; and swollen as they are by the %0avast accession of the pluvial waters, they reverberate against %0athe sides and bottom of their channels. Occasionally, too, %0athe Tiber, overflowing, is thrown backward in its course, and %0adischarges itself by these outlets : obstinate is the contest that %0aensues within between the meeting tides, but so firm and solid %0ais the masonry, that it is enabled to offer an effectual resist- %0aance. Enormous as are the accumulations that are carried along %0aabove, the work of the channels never gives way. Houses %0afalling spontaneously to ruins, or levelled with the ground %0aby conflagrations, are continually battering against them ; %0athe ground, too, is shaken by earthquakes every now and %0athen ; and yet, built as they were in the days of Tarquinius %0aPriscus, seven hundred years ago, these constructions have %0asurvived, all but unharmed. "We must not omit, too, to men- %0ation one remarkable circumstance, and all the more remark- %0aable from the fact, that the most celebrated historians have %0aomitted to mention it. |"Tarquinius Priscus having commenced %0athe sewers, and set the lower classes to work upon them, the %0alaboriousness and prolonged duration of the employment be- %0acame equally an object of dread to them ; and the consequence %0awas, that suicide was a thing of common occurrence, the %0a%0a79 " Mound," or " Terrace."

See Chapter 20 of this Book. %0a%0a61 a.u.c , 721. He alludes probably to the cleansing of the sewers be- %0aneath the city, which took place, Dion Cassius informs us, in the aedile- %0aship of Agrippa. %0a%0a%0a%0a348 %0a%0a%0a%0apunt's NATTJEAL IIISTOBY.

For %0athis evil, however, the king devised a singular remedy, and %0aone that has never 81 * been resorted to either before that time or %0asince : for he ordered the bodies of all who had been thus %0aguilty of self-destruction, to be fastened to a cross, and left %0athere as a spectacle to their fellow - citizens and a prey %0ato birds and wild beasts. The result was, that that sense %0aof propriety which so peculiarly attaches itself to the Eo- %0amau name, and which more than once has gained a victory %0awhen the battle was all but lost, came to the rescue on this %0aoccasion as well ; though for this once, the Romans were in %0areality its dupes, as they forgot that, though they felt shocked %0aat the thoughts of such ignominy w T hile alive, they would be %0aquite insensible to any such disgrace when dead. It is said %0athat Tarquinius made these sewers of dimensions sufficiently %0alarge to admit of a waggon laden with hay passing along them./ %0a%0aAll that we have just described, however, is but trifling %0awhen placed in comparison with one marvellous fact, which I %0amust not omit to mention before I pass on to other subjects. %0aIn the consulship 82 of M. Lepidus and Q. Catulus, there was %0anot at Eome, as we learn from the most trustworthy au- %0athors, a finer house than the one which belonged to Lepidus %0ahimself : and yet, by Hercules ! within five-and-thirty years %0afrom that period, the very same house did not hold the hun- %0adredth rank even in the City ! Let a person, if he will, in %0ataking this fact into consideration, only calculate the vast %0amasses of marble, the productions of painters, the regal trea- %0asures that must have been expended, in bringing these hundred %0amansions to vie with one that had been in its day the most sump- %0atuous and the most celebrated in all the City ; and then let %0ahim reflect how that, since that period, and down to the pre- %0asent time, these houses have all of them been surpassed by %0aothers without number. There can be no doubt that confla- %0agrations are a punishment inflicted upon us for our luxury ; %0abut such are our habits, that in spite of such warnings as these, %0awe cannot be made to understand that there are things in exist- %0aence more perishable even than man himself. %0a%0aBut there are still two other mansions by which all these %0aedifices have been eclipsed. Twice have we seen the whole %0a%0a8l * As Hardouin remarks, the story of the Milesian Virgins, as related %0aby Aulus Gellius and Plutarch, is very similar. 82 a.u.c 676. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 24.] MARVELLOUS BUILDINGS AT ROME %0a%0a%0a%0a349 %0a%0a%0a%0aCity environed by the palaces of the Emperors Caius 83 and %0aNero ; that of the last, that nothing might be wanting to %0aits magnificence, being coated with gold. 84 Surely such palaces %0aas these must have been intended for the abode of those who %0acreated this mighty empire, and who left the plough or their %0anative hearth to go forth to conquer nations, and to return %0aladen with triumphs ! men, in fact, whose very fields even occu- %0apied less space than the audience-chambers 85 of these palaces. %0a%0aIndeed, one cannot but help reflecting how trifling a portion of %0athese palaces was equal to the sites which the republic granted %0ato its invincible generals, for the erection of their dwellings. %0aThe supreme honour, too, attendant upon these grants — as in %0athe case of P. Valerius Publicola, the first consul with L. Bru- %0atus, for his many meritorious services ; and of his brother, %0awho twice in one consulship defeated the Sabines — was the %0apermission granted, by the terms of the decree, to have the %0adoors of their houses opening from without, and the gates %0athrown back upon the public street. Such was the most dis- %0atinguished privilege accorded in those days to triumphal man- %0asions even ! %0a%0aI will not permit, however, these two Caiuses, 86 or two %0aNeros, to enjoy this glory even, such as it is ; for I will prove %0athat these extravagant follies of theirs have been surpassed, in %0athe use that was made of his wealth by M. Scaurus, a private %0acitizen. Indeed, I am by no means certain that it was not %0athe sedileship of this personage that inflicted the first great %0ahlow upon the public manners, and that Sylla was not guilty %0aof a greater crime in giving such unlimited power to his step- %0ason, 87 than in the proscription of so many thousands. During %0ahis sedileship, and only for the temporary purposes of a few %0adays, Scaurus executed the greatest 88 work that has ever been %0a%0a83 Caligula. The Palace of Caligula was situate on the Palatine Hill : %0athat of Nero extended from the Palatine Hill to the Esquiline, nearly the %0awhole of which was covered by it. It was left unfinished by Nero, but %0athe Emperor Otho completed it. Martial, Spectac. Ep. 2, speaks in terms %0aof indignation of there being now but one house in all the City ;" but, %0aunfortunately, he gives utterance to it with a. view of flattering Domitian. %0a%0a84 Whence its name, " Aurea," the " golden" Palace. 85 " Sellaria." %0a%0a86 By this mode of expression, he probably means that they were " birds %0aof a feather" — one as bad as the other. %0a%0a87 His mother, Metella Cajcilia, became the wife of Sylla. %0a%0a88 He forgets the Pyramids and the Labyrinth of Egypt, which he has %0aso recently described. %0a%0a%0a%0a3.50 %0a%0a%0a%0aplikt's natural history. %0a%0a%0a%0a[Book XXXVI. %0a%0a%0a%0amade by the hands of man, even when intended to be of ever- %0alasting duration ; his Theatre, I mean. This building con- %0asisted of three storeys, supported upon three hundred and %0asixty columns ; and this, too, in a city which had not allowed %0awithout some censure one of its greatest citizens 89 to erect %0asix 90 pillars of Hymettian marble. The ground-storey was of %0amarble, the second of glass, a species of luxury which ever %0asince that time has been quite unheard of, and the highest of %0agilded wood. The lowermost columns, as previously 91 stated, %0awere eight-and-thirty feet in height ; and, placed between %0athese columns, as already 92 mentioned, were brazen statues, %0athree thousand in number. The area 93 of this theatre afforded %0aaccommodation for eighty thousand spectators ; and yet the %0aTheatre of Pompeius, after the City had so greatly increased, %0aand the inhabitants had become so vastly more numerous, was %0aconsidered abundantly large, with its sittings for forty thou- %0asand only. The rest of the fittings of it, what with Attalic 94 %0avestments, pictures, and the other stage -properties, 95 were of %0asuch enormous value that, after Scaurus had had conveyed to %0ahis Tusculan villa such parts thereof as were not required for %0athe enjoyment of his daily luxuries, the loss was no less than %0athree hundred millions of sesterces, when the villa was burnt %0aby his servants in a spirit of revenge. %0a%0aThe consideration of such prodigality as this quite distracts %0amy attention, and compels me to digress from my original pur- %0apose, in order to mention a still greater instance of extrava- %0agance, in reference to wood. C. Curio, 96 who died during the %0acivil wars, fighting on the side of Caesar, found, to his dismay, %0athat he could not, when celebrating the funeral games in %0ahonour of his father, surpass the riches and magnificence of %0aScaurus — for where, in fact, was to be found such a stepsire %0aas Sylla, and such a mother as Metella, that bidder at all %0aauctions for the property of the proscribed ? Where, too, was %0ahe to find for his father, M. Scaurus, so long the principal man %0ain the city, and one who had acted, in his alliance with Marius, %0a%0a89 See B. xvii. c. 1, and Chapter 3 of the present Book. L.

It is really worth our while to know what this device %0awas, if only to congratulate ourselves upon the manners of the %0apresent day, and to reverse the ordinary mode of expression, %0aand term ourselves the men of the olden time. 07 %0a%0aHe caused to be erected, close together, two theatres of very %0alarge dimensions, and built of wood, each of them nicely poised, %0aand turning on a pivot. Before mid-day, a spectacle of games %0awas exhibited in each ; the theatres being turned back to back, %0ain order that the noise of neither of them might interfere with %0awhat was going on in the other. Then, in the latter part of %0athe day, all on a sudden, the two theatres were swung round, %0aand, the corners uniting, brought face to face; the outer %0aframes, 98 too, were removed, and thus an amphitheatre was %0aformed, in which combats of gladiators were presented to the %0aview ; men whose safety was almost less compromised than was %0athat of the Koman people, in allowing itself to be thus whirled %0around from side to side. Now, in this case, which have we %0amost reason to admire, the inventor or the invention ? the artist, %0aor the author of the project ? him who first dared to think of %0asuch an enterprize, or him who ventured to undertake it ? him %0awho obeyed the order, or him who gave it ? But the thing that %0asurpasses all is, the frenzy that must have possessed the public, %0ato take their seats in a place which must of necessity have been %0aso unsubstantial and so insecure. Lo and behold ! here is a %0apeople that has conquered the whole earth, that has subdued %0athe universe, that divides the spoils of kingdoms and of nations, %0athat sends its laws to foreign lands, that shares in some degree %0athe attributes of the immortal gods in common with mankind, %0asuspended aloft in a machine, and showering plaudits even upon %0aits own peril ! %0a%0a87 And, consequently, of more strict manners, and more strict morals. %0a%0a93 "Tabulis."

"When cities are swallowed up by %0aun earthquake, it is looked upon by mankind as a general cala- %0amity ; and yet, here have we the whole lloman people, em- %0abarked, so to say, in two ships, and sitting suspended on a %0acouple of pivots ; the grand spectacle being its own struggle %0awith danger, and its liability to perish at any moment that the %0aoverstrained machinery may give way ! And then the object, %0atoo, of all this — that public favour may he conciliated for the %0atribune's" harangues at a future day, and that, at the Rostra, %0ahe may still have the power of shaking the tribes, nicely %0abalanced 1 as they are ! And really, what may he not dare %0awith those who, at his persuasion, have braved such perils as %0athese ? Indeed, to confess the truth, at the funeral games %0acelebrated at the tomb of his father, it was no less than the %0awhole Roman people that shared the dangers of the gladiatorial %0acombats. When the pivots had now been sufficiently worked %0aand wearied, he gave another turn to his magnificent displays. %0aFor, upon the last day, still preserving the form of the amphi- %0atheatre, he cut the stage in two through the middle, and exhi- %0abited a spectacle of athletes ; after which, the stage being %0asuddenly withdrawn on either side, he exhibited a combat, %0aupon the same day, between such of the gladiators as had %0apreviously proved victorious.

Under these %0aprinces, the Curtian and Coerulean Waters, with the New %0aAnio, 13 were brought from a distance of forty miles, and at so %0ahigh a level that all the hills were supplied with water, on %0awhich the City is built. The sum expended on these works %0awas three hundred and fifty millions of sesterces. If we only %0atake into consideration the abundant supply of water to the %0apublic, for baths, ponds, canals, household purposes, gardens, %0a%0a5 See B. iii. c. 17. It was commenced by M. Curius Dentatus, B.C. %0a273, the water being brought a distance of 43 miles. It was afterwards %0aknown as the " Anio Vet/us," to distinguish it from another aqueduct from %0athe same river, mentioned in this Chapter, and called the " Aiio Isovus." %0aThe former was constructed of Peperino stone, and the water- course was %0alined with cement. Considerable remains of it are still to be seen. %0a%0a6 The Aqua Tepula was constructed B.C. 127 ; so that it is doubtful if %0aPliny is not here in error. %0a%0a7 The Aqua Marcia was brought a distance of upwards of 60 miles, %0afrom the vicinity of Sublaqueum, new Subiaco, and was of 6uch elevation %0athat water could be supplied to the loftiest part of the Capitoline Hill. %0aA considerable number of the arches are still standing. In the vicinity of %0athe city it was afterwards united with the Aqua Tepula and the Aqua %0aJulia; the watercourse of the last being above that of the Aqua Tepula, %0aand that above the course of the Aqua Marcia.

In those %0aparts where the soil was found to be terreous, it was necessary %0ato pump up the water by the aid of machinery ; in other parts, %0aagain, the solid rock had to be hewn through. All this, too, %0ahad to be done in the midst of darkness within ; a series of %0aoperations which can only be adequately conceived by those %0awho were witnesses of them, aud which no human language %0acan possibly describe. %0a%0aI pass in silence the harbour that has been formed at Ostia ; %0athe various roads, too, that have been cut across mountains ; %0athe Tyrrhenian Sea separated by an embankment from Lake %0aLucrinus ; 16 and vast numbers of bridges constructed at an %0aenormous expense. Among the many other marvels, too, of %0aItaly, we are informed by Papirius Fabianus, a most diligent %0aenquirer into the operations of Nature, that the marble there %0agrows in the quarries ; and those who work in the quarries %0aassure us that the wounds thus inflicted upon the mountains %0afill up spontaneously. If such is the fact, luxury has good %0a" Nero. %0a%0a15 See B. ii. c. 106, and B. in. c. 17. In order to check the sudden %0arise of its waters, a design was entertained by Julius Ceesar to construct a %0asubterranean canal from the lake into the valley of the Liris, which, unfor- %0atunately, was frustrated by his death. Claudius, however, executed the work, %0aby cutting a gallery upwards of an English mile and a half through the %0alimestone rock ; a work which, according to Suetonius, occupied thirty %0athousand workmen continually for eleven years. Oa opening it with a %0amock naval combat, an accident happened in which many persons lost %0atheir lives, and Claudius himself but narrowly escaped. The emissary %0aanswered its purpose for some time, and, though Nero suffered the works %0ato fall into decay, they were repaired by Hadrian. In the middle ages, %0ahowever, the work fell in, and has not since been restored. %0a%0a46 See B. iii. c. 9. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 25.] %0a%0a%0a%0aTHE MAGNET. %0a%0a%0a%0a355 %0a%0a%0a%0agrounds for hoping that it will never be at a loss for a supply %0aof materials for its gratification. %0a%0aCHAP. 25. (16.) THE MAGNET : THREE REMEDIES %0a%0a• %0a%0aUpon quitting the marbles to pass on to the other more %0aremarkable stones, who can for a moment doubt that the %0amagnet 17 will be the first to suggest itself? For what, in fact, %0ais there endowed with more marvellous properties than this ? %0aor in which of her departments has Nature displayed a greater %0adegree of waywardness ? She had given a voice to rocks, as %0aalready 13 mentioned, and had enabled them to answer man, or %0arather, I should say, to throw back his own words in his teeth. %0a"What is there in existence more inert than a piece of rigid %0astone ? And yet, behold ! Nature has here endowed stone with %0aboth sense and hands. What is there more stubborn than %0ahard iron ? Nature has, in this instance, bestowed upon it both %0afeet and intelligence. It allows itself, in fact, to be attracted %0aby the magnet, and, itself a metal which subdues all other ele- %0aments, it precipitates itself towards the source of an influence %0aat once mysterious and unseen. The moment the metal comes %0anear it, it springs towards the magnet, and, as it clasps it, %0ais held fast in the magnet's embraces. Hence it is that this %0astone is sometimes known by the name of " sideritis ;" 19 another %0aname given to it being " heraclion." 20 It received its name %0a" magnes," Nicander informs us, from the person who was the %0afirst to discover it, upon Ida. 21 It is found, too, in various %0aother countries, as in Spain, for example. Magnes, it is said, %0amade this discovery, when, upon taking his herds to pasture, %0ahe found that the nails of his shoes and the iron ferrel of his %0astaff adhered to the ground. %0a%0aSotacus 22 describes five' 23 different kinds of magnet ; the %0a.Ethiopian magnet ; that of Magnesia, a country which borders %0a%0a17 " Magnes." 18 In Chapter 23 of this Book. %0a%0a19 "Iron earth;" from oiSnpog, "iron." The magnet, or loadstone %0aitself, is an oxide of iron, known as Oxidulated iron, or Ferroso-fernc %0aoxide ; sometimes in combination with quartz or alumine. %0a%0a20 From Heraclea, in Lydia, or in Thessaly, according to some ac- %0acounts. It is not improbable, however, that it was so called after " He- %0aracles," or Hercules, on account of its powerful influence upon iron ores. %0a%0a21 Isidorus says, "India," in B. 16 of the "Origines." %0a%0a22 See the list of authors at the end of this Book. %0a21 Varieties, no doubt, of oxide of iron. %0a%0a%0a%0a35G %0a%0a%0a%0aplint's natural HISTORT. %0a%0a%0a%0a[Dook XXXVI. %0a%0a%0a%0aon Macedonia, and lies to the right of the road which leads from %0athe town of Bcebe to Iolcos ; a third, from Hyettus in Bceotia ; %0aa fourth, from Alexandria in Troas ; and a fifth, from Magnesia %0ain Asia. The leading distinction in magnets is the sex, male %0aand female," and the next great difference in them is the %0acolour. Those of Magnesia, bordering on Macedonia, are of %0aa reddish black : those of Boeotia are more red than black ; and %0athe kind that is found in Troas is black, of the female sex, %0aand consequently destitute of attractive power. The most %0ainferior, however, of all, are those of Magnesia in Asia : they %0aare white, have no attractive influence on iron, and resemble %0apumice in appearance. It has been found by experience, that %0athe more nearly the magnet approaches to an azure colour, %0athe better it is in quality. The ^Ethiopian magnet is looked %0aupon as the best of all, and is purchased at its weight in silver: %0aZmiris in Ethiopia is the place where it is found, such being %0athe name of a region there, covered with sand. %0a%0aIn the same country, too, the magnet called " haematites" 25 is %0afound, a stone of a blood-red colour, and which, when bruised, %0ayields a tint like that of blood, as also of saffron. The %0ahaematites has not the same property 26 of attracting iron that %0athe ordinary magnet has. The Ethiopian magnet is recog- %0anized by this peculiarity, that it has the property, also, of %0aattracting other magnets to it 27 All these minerals are use- %0aful as ingredients in ophthalmic preparations, in certain propor- %0ations according to the nature of each : they are particularly %0agood, too, for arresting defluxions of the eyes. Triturated in %0aa calcined state, they have a healing effect upon burns. %0a%0aIn -^Ethiopia, too, not far from Zmiris, there is a mountain %0ain which the stone called " theamedes" 28 is found, a mineral %0a%0a24 An absurd distinction, as Ajasson remarks; based, probably, on East- %0aern notions, and with reference to the comparative powers of attraction. %0a%0a25 From uifxa, "blood." He alludes to Specular iron, red ochre, or %0ared hematite, another oxide of iron. %0a%0a26 Sometimes it has, but in a very slight degree. %0a%0a« Ajasson remarks tliat most probably the possessors of this pretended %0avariety knew the distinction between the two poles of the magnet, and %0atook care, when it was their interest to do so, to place the opposite pole to- %0awards that of the other loadstone. %0a%0a2 » It was the belief of the Duke of Noya CarafFa, that this stone was identi- %0acal with Tourmaline : but, as Beckmann Bays, tourmaline, when heated, first %0aattracts iron, and then repels it.

STONE OF SCYEOS. %0a%0aIn the Isle of Scyros 30 there is a stone, 31 they say, which floats %0aupon water when whole, but which falls to the bottom when %0abroken into fragments. %0a%0aCHAP. 27. (17.) SARCOPHAGUS, Oil STONE OF ASSOS '. TEN %0a%0aREMEDIES. %0a%0aAt Assos in Troas, there is found a stone of a laminated %0atexture, called " sarcophagus." 32 It is a well-known fact, that %0adead bodies, when buried in this stone, are consumed in the %0acourse of forty days, with the sole exception of the teeth. %0aAccording to Mucianus, too, mirrors, body-scrapers, garments, %0aand shoes, that have been buried with the dead, become trans- %0aformed into stone. In Lycia, and in the East, there are certain %0a6tones of a similar nature, which, when attached to the bodies %0aof the living even, corrode the flesh. %0a%0aCnAP. 28. CHERNITES. %0a%0aLess active in its properties is chernites, 33 a stone which %0apreserves bodies without consuming them, and strongly resem- %0ables ivory in appearance : the body of King Darius, they say, %0awas buried in it. The stone that is known as " porus," S3 is %0asimilar to Parian marble in hardness and whiteness, but is not %0aso heavy. Theophrastus mentions also a transparent stone %0athat is found in Egypt, and is similar to stone of Chios in %0aappearance; it is by no means improbable that it may have %0aexisted in his time, for stones, we know, disappear, and new %0akinds are discovered. The stone of Assos, 34 which is saltish %0ato the taste, modifies the attacks of gout, the feet being placed %0ain a vessel made of it for the purpose ; in addition to which, %0athan the ordinary loadstone, with the negative pole presented, by designing %0apersons, towards another magnet. %0a%0a» In B. ii. c. 98, and B. xx. c. 1. 30 See B. iv. c. 23. %0a%0a31 See B. ii. c. 106, Vol. I. p. 137, and Note 4.

Ajassou %0aidentifies it with Alunite, or Alum stone, in its several varieties. %0a%0a33 Both of them varieties of calcareous tufa, Ajasson thinks. %0a%0a34 Or Sarcophagus : see the preceding Chapter. %0a%0a%0a%0a358 %0a%0a%0a%0aplint's natural histoet. %0a%0a%0a%0afBook XXXVI. %0a%0a%0a%0ain the quarries of this stone, all maladies of the legs disappear, %0awhereas, in mines in general, the legs become affected with %0adisease. " Flower of stone of Assos" is the name given to %0aa soft stone which crumbles into dust, and is found very effi- %0acacious in some cases ; it resembles red pumice in appearance. %0aIn combination with Cyprian wax, this stone is curative of affec- %0ations of the mamillsB ; and, employed with pitch or resin, it %0adisperses scrofulous sores and inflammatory tumours. Used in %0athe form of an electuary, it is good for phthisis, and, with honey, %0ait causes old sores to cicatrize, and consumes proud flesh. It %0ais used, also, for the cure of wounds of an obstinate nature %0ainflicted by animals, and acts as a desiccativo upon suppura- %0ations. Plaisters, too, are made of it for gout, bean-meal being %0aincorporated with it for the purpose. %0a%0aCHAP. 29. (18.) — OSSEOUS STONES. PALM STONES. COKAKI. %0aBLACK STONES. %0a%0aTheophrastus and Mucianus are of opinion that there are %0acertain stones which bring 35 forth other stones. Theophrastus %0astates, also, that a fossil 36 ivory is found, both white and %0ablack ; that the earth, too, produces bones, and that osseous 37 %0astones are sometimes found. In the vicinity of Munda in %0aSpain, the place where the Dictator Caesar defeated Pompeius, 38 %0athere are stones found, which, when broken asunder, bear the %0aimpression of palm leaves. 39 %0a%0aThere are some black stones, also, which are held in much %0athe same esteem as the marbles ; the Tsenarian 40 stone, for %0aexample. Varro says that the black stone of Africa is more %0adurable than that of Italy ; while, on the other hand, the white %0acorani" are harder than Parian marble. He states, also, that %0a%0a35 Democritus, amongst the ancients, and Savonarola and Cardan, in more %0arecent times, have attributed to stones the powers of reproduction. Vives %0aspeaks of certain diamonds which conceive and fructify ; and Avicenna %0aspeaks of the selenite or moon-stone of Arabia, which, when suspended %0afrom a tree, generates other stones of a similar nature. Tournefort also %0aentertained similar opinions. %0a%0a36 Fossil teeth of mammiferae, probably. %0a%0a37 Fossil animal remains, no doubt. %0a%0a38 Cneius Pompeius. See 15. iii. c. 3. %0a%0a» 9 "Palmati." This is more probably the meaning, than the "human %0apalm," as Littre renders it.

Among the prodigies that have happened, I find men- %0ation made of millstones that have moved of themselves. %0a%0aCHAP. 30. MOLAR STONES. PYRITES ; SEVEN REMEDIES. %0a%0aIn no country are the molar stones 43 superior to those of %0aItaly ; stones, be it remembered, and not fragments of rock : %0athere are some provinces, too, where they are not to be found %0aat all. Some stones of this class are softer than others, and %0aadmit of being smoothed with the whetstone, so as to present %0aall the appearance, at a distance, of ophites. 41 There is no %0astone of a more durable nature than this ; for in general, stone, %0alike wood, suffers from the action, more or less, of rain, heat, %0aand cold. Some kinds, again, become deteriorated by the action %0aof the moon, while others are apt to contract a rust in lapse of %0atime, or to change their white colour when steeped in oil. %0a%0a(19.) Some persons give this molar stone the name of %0a"pyrites," 45 from the circumstance that it has a great affinity %0ato fire ; 46 but there is also another kind of pyrites, of a more %0aporous nature, and another, 47 again, which resembles copper. %0aThis last, it is said, is found in the mines, near Acamas, 48 in the %0aIsle of Cyprus ; one variety of it being of a silver, another of a %0agolden, colour. There are various methods of melting these %0astones, some persons fusing them twice, or three times even, in %0ahoney, till all the liquid has evaporated ; while others, again, %0acalcine them upon hot coals, and, after treating them with %0ahoney, wash them like copper. %0a%0aThe medicinal properties which these minerals possess are of %0aa calorific, desiccative, dispersive, and resolvent nature, and, %0a%0ain Italy : See B. iii. c. 9.

They %0aare employed also, in a crude state and pulverized, for the %0acure of scrofulous sores and boils. Some writers mention %0aanother kind of pyrites also. Those amoDg them have the %0agreatest affinity to fire which we distinguish as "live" 49 %0apyrites. They are the most ponderous of all, and are found %0aremarkably useful for advance-guards when laying out encamp- %0aments ; for, on being struck with a nail or any other kind of stone, %0athey emit a spark, which, received upon sulphur, dried fungus, 40 %0aor leaves, produces a fire almost sooner than it could be named. %0a%0aCHAP. 31. — OSTRACITES; FOUR BEMEDIES.

Taken in drink, they arrest dis- %0acharges of blood ; and, applied topically with honey, they are %0acurative of ulcerations and pains in the mamillse. %0a%0aAmianthus 62 resembles alumen 63 in appearance, and suffers %0ano diminution from the action of fire.

GAGATES : SIX BEMF.DIES. %0a%0aGagates 57 is a stone, so called from Gages, the name of a %0atown and river in Lycia. 68 It is asserted, too, that at Leu- %0acolla 69 the sea throws it up, and that it is found over a space %0atwelve stadia in extent. It is black, smooth, light, and porous, %0adiffers but little from wood in appearance, 59 * is of a brittle %0atexture, and emits a disagreeable odour 60 when rubbed. Marks %0amade upon pottery with this stone cannot be effaced. When %0aburnt, it gives out a sulphureous smell; and it is a singular %0afact, that the application of water ignites it, while that of oil %0aquenches it. 61 The fumes of it, burnt, keep serpents at a dis- %0atance, and dispel hysterical affections : they detect a tendency %0aalso to epilepsy, 62 and act as a test of virginity. 63 A decoction %0aof this stone in wine is curutive of tooth-ache ; and, in combina- %0ation with wax, it is good for scrofula. The magicians, it is %0asaid, make use of gagates in the practice of what they call %0a%0aMe that it derived its .name from /itXi, " honey," in consequence of its %0acolour than by reason of its supposed sweet juices. The Mullite, Melli- %0ar. te, or Honey-stone of modem Mineralogy, also known as Mellate of %0aAlumina, has its name from its honey-yellow colour. It is found in Thu- %0aringia, Moravia, and Bohemia ; but most probablv was unknown in the %0adays of Pliny. 56 See B. xx. cc. 6, 21. %0a%0a67 Our jet, which somewhat resembles canncl-coal. and is found in clay %0asoils. %0a%0a58 See B. v. c. 28, where a place called " Gagae" is mentioned. In Note %0a5 to that Chapter, " gagates" is erroneously rendered " agate." %0a%0a59 See B. v. c. 26. %0a%0a59 * This comparison is not inapt, as it is closely akin to Lignite, or brown %0acoal. %0a%0a60 A bituminous and animal odour, Ajasson says, quite peculiar to itself. %0a%0a61 He has borrowed this erroneous assertion, probably, from Nitander, %0awho, with Pliny, says the same of the "Thracian stone," which has not been %0aidentified, but is supposed to have been a sort of coal. See B. xxxiii. c. 30. %0a%0a62 This is, probably, the meaning of "sonticus morbus," a disease, %0awhich, accordiugto the jurists, excused those affected with it, from attend- %0aing in courts of justice. %0a%0a03 Albcrtus Magnus, De Mineral, B. ii., says that if it is given in water to %0aa female, it will have a diuretic effect immediately, if she is not in a state %0aof virginity, and that the contrary will be the case if she is. %0a%0a%0a%0a362 %0a%0a%0a%0aflint's natural HISTORY.

PHRYGIAN STONE. %0a%0aPhrygian stone is so called from the country which produces %0ait, and is a porous mass like pumice. It is first saturated witli %0awine, and then calcined, the fire being kept up with the %0abellows till the stone is brought to a red heat ; which done, it %0ais quenched in sweet wine. This operation is repeated three %0atimes. The only use made of it is for dyeing cloths. 66 %0a%0aCHAP. 37. (20.) HAEMATITES : FIVE REMEDIES.

The latter is found in mines, and, when burnt, has %0ajust the colour 63 of minium. 69 It is calcined in the same %0amanner as Phrygian stone, but is not quenched in wine. Adul- %0aterations of it are detected by the appearance of red veins in it, %0aand by its comparative friabilit)'. It is marvellously useful as %0aan application for bloodshot eyes, and, taken internally, it acts %0aas a check upon female discharges. To patients vomiting %0ablood, it is administered in combination with pomegranate- %0ajuiee. It is very efficacious also for affections of the bladder ; %0aand it is taken with wine for the cure of wounds inflicted by %0aserpents. %0a%0a64 See B. xxx. c. 5. According to Dalechamps, this was practised by %0aplacing the jet upon a hatchet at a red heat. %0a%0a65 " Stone-macerater."

Applied %0awith woman's milk, it is particularly useful for arresting dis- %0acharges from the corners of the eyes, 71 and it is also very %0aserviceable for reducing procidence of those organs. Such, at %0aleast, is the opinion of the authors who have most recently %0awritten on the subject. %0a%0aCHAP. 38. JETHIOPIC HAEMATITES. ANDRODAMAS ; TWO REMEDIES. %0a%0aABABIAN HAEMATITES. MILTITES OR HEFATITES. ANTHRACITES. %0a%0aSotacus, one of the most ancient Avriters, says, that there are %0afive kinds of hsematites, in addition to the magnet 73 so called. %0aHe gives the preference among them to that of ^Ethiopia, 73 a %0avery useful ingredient in ophthalmic preparations and the com- %0apositions which he calls " pancbresta," 74 and good for the cure of %0aburns. The second, he says, is called " androdamas," 76 of a %0ablack 76 colour, remarkable for its weight and hardness, to which %0ait owes its name, in fact, and found in Africa more particularly. %0aIt attracts silver, he says, copper, and iron, and is tested with %0aa touchstone made of basanites. 77 It yields a liquid the colour %0aof blood, and is an excellent remedy for diseases of the liver. %0aThe third kind that he mentions is the haematites 78 of Arabia, a %0amineral of equal hardness, and which with difficulty yields, %0aupon the water-whetstone, a liquid sometimes approaching the %0atint of saffron. The fourth 79 kind, he says, is known as "hepa- %0a%0a70 Literally, " split" stone; so called, probably, from its laminated form. %0aAjasson identifies it with yellow or brown iron ore, known in Mineralogy %0aa3 Limonite, or Brown Hematite. %0a%0a71 "Explendis oculorum lacunis." %0a%0an Mentioned in Chapter 25 of this Book. %0a%0a73 Mentioned also in Chapter 25. Probably Red peroxide of iron, in a %0amassive form. 11 " Ail-serviceable," or " all-heal." %0a%0a75 "Man-subduing." %0a%0a76 The colour of Specular iron, or red peroxide of iron, being of a dark %0aBteel-grey or iron-black, this is probably another variety of it. Ajasson %0athinks that it includes compact or massive red oxide of iron, and scaly red %0airon, or red iron froth, which leaves red marks upon the fingers. %0a%0a77 See Chapter 11 of this Book. Its alleged attraction of silver and %0acopper is fabulous, no doubt. %0a%0a73 This is probably the Limonite, or Hydrous peroxide of iron, men- %0ationed in the preceding Chapter. See Note 70 above. %0a%0a79 Identified by Ajasson with Red ochre, or Reddle, a red peroxide of %0airon, used for red crayons in drawing. %0a%0a%0a%0a364 %0a%0a%0a%0apliny's natural history.

The fifth 83 %0avariety is schistos ; a substance which, taken internally, arrests %0ahaemorrhoidal discharges. Upon the same authority, it is re- %0acommended to take any kind of haematites, fasting, in doses of %0athree drachmae, triturated in oil, for affections of the blood. 8i %0a%0aThe same author mentions also a kind of schistos which has no %0aaffinity to haematites, and to which he gives the name of " an- %0athracites." 85 It is a native of Africa, he says, and is of a %0ablack colour. When rubbed upon a water- whetstone, it yields %0aa black colour on the side which has adhered to the earth, and, %0aon the opposite side, a saffron tint. He states also that it is a %0auseful ingredient in ophthalmic preparations. %0a%0aCHAP. 39. (21) AKTITES. TAPMTJSIAN STONE. CALL1SIUS. %0a%0aThe stone called aetites 86 has a great reputation, in conse- %0aquence of the name which it bears. It is found in the neBts %0aof eagles, as already mentioned in our Tenth Book. 87 There %0aare always two of these stones found together, they say, a male %0astone and a female; and without them, it is said, the various %0aeagles that we have described would be unable to propagate. %0aHence it is, too, that the young of the eagle are never more %0athan two in number. There are four varieties of the aetites : %0athat of Africa is soft and diminutive, and contains in the %0ainterior — in its bowels as it were — a sweet, white, argillaceous %0aearth. It is friable, and is generally thought to be of the %0afemale sex. The male stone, on the other hand, which is found %0ain Arabia, is hard, and similar to a nut-gall in appearance; %0aor else of a reddish hue, with a hard stone in the interior. The %0athird kind is a stone found in the Isle of Cyprus, and resembles %0a%0aso « Liver-stone." Not to be confounded with the Hepatite of modern %0aMineralogy, or Sulphate of Barytes. *i " Spleen-stone." %0a%0aH2 See B. xxxv. c. 14. %0a%0a83 Identified by Ajasson with Laminated protoxide of iron. It has pro- %0abably an affinity to the varietv noticed above, in Notes 70 and 78. %0a%0a8 * Owing solely, in all probability, to its name, " blood-stone." %0a%0a65 Ajasson is at a loss to know whether this is our Anthracite, a non- %0abituminous coal, or some kind of bituminous coal. Delafosse takes it to be %0apit-coal. %0a%0a81 Or "eagle-stone." It is a Geodes, mentioned in Chapter 23 of this %0aBook, a globular mass of clay iron-stone. Sometimes it is hollow within, %0aand sometimes it encloses another stone, or a little water, or some minerai %0adust.

It is %0amet with in the beds of- rivers there, and is white and round; %0ahaving another stone in the interior, the name given to which %0ais " callimus :" none of the varieties of aetites have a smoother %0asurface than this. Attached to pregnant women or to cattle, %0ain the skins of animals that have been sacrificed, these stones %0aact as a preventive of abortion, care being taken not to remove %0athem till the moment of parturition ; for otherwise procidencu %0aof the uterus is the result. If, on the other hand, they are not %0aremoved at the moment when parturition is about to ensue, %0athat operation of Nature cannot be effected. %0a%0aCHAP. 40. SAMIAN STONE: EIGHT REMEDIES. %0a%0aSamian stone 89 comes from the same island which produces %0athe earth in praise of which we have spoken already. 90 It is %0auseful for giving a polish to gold, and it is employed medicinally %0afor the treatment of ulcerations of the eyes, combined with milk %0ain manner already 91 described. It is good, too, for watery dis- %0acharges of a chronic nature, from the eyes. Taken internally, %0ait is useful for affections of the stomach, and it has the effect %0aof dispelling vertigo and restoring the spirits when depressed. %0aSome writers are of opinion that this stone may be administered %0awith advantage for epilepsy and strangury ; and it is employed %0aas an ingredient in the restoratives known as " acopa." 92 The %0atest of its purity is its weight and its whiteness. Some persons %0awill have it that, worn as an amulet, it, acts as a preventive of %0aabortion. %0a%0aCHAP. 41.

PUMICE ; JJIXE KE3IED1ES. %0a%0aAnd here, too, I must not omit to give some account of %0apumice. 94 This name is very generally given, it is true, to those %0aporous pieces of stone, which we see suspended in the erec- %0ations known as " musaia," 93 with the view of artificially %0agiving them all the appearance of caverns. But the genuine %0apumice-stones, that are in use for imparting smoothness to the %0askin of females, and not females only, but men as well, and, as %0aCatullus 97 says, for polishing books, are found of the finest quality %0ain the islands of Helos and Nisyros 98 and in the ^Eolian Isles. %0aTo be good, they should be white, as light as possible, porous and %0adry in the extreme, friable, and free from sand when rubbed. %0a%0aConsidered niedicinallj r , pumice is of a resolvent and desic- %0acative nature ; for which purpose it is submitted to calcination, %0ano less than three times, on a fire of pure charcoal, it being %0aqueuched as often in white wine. It is then washed, like %0acadmia," and, after being dried, is put by for keeping, in a %0aplace as free from damp as possible. In a powdered state, %0apumice is used in ophthalmic preparations more particularly, %0aand acts as a lenitive detergent upon ulcerations of the eyes. %0aIt also makes new flesh upon cicatrizations of those organs, %0aand removes all traces of the marks. Some prefer, after the %0athird calcination, leaving the pumice to cool, and then triturating %0ait in wine. It is employed also as an ingredient in emollient %0apoultices, being extremely useful for ulcerations on the head %0aand generative organs ; dentifrices, too, are prepared from it. %0aAccording to Theophrastus, 1 persons when drinking for a wager %0aare in the habit 2 of taking powdered pumice first ; but they %0arun great risk, he says, if they fail to swallow the whole %0adraught of wine at once ; it being of so refrigerative a nature %0a%0a« Pumice is still used as the basis of a dentifrice, but it destroys the %0aenamel of the teeth. 95 gee Note 90 above %0a%0aM Or " temples of the Muses :" evidently grottos in the present instance. %0a%0a" In allusion to the line, "Arida modo pumice expolitum" — " J iust %0apolished with dry pumice-stone."

(22.) — STONES FOE MORTAltS USED FOB MEDICINAL AND %0aOTHER PURPOSES. ETIOSIAN STONE. THEBAIC STONE. CHAXA- %0aZIAN STONE. %0a%0aAuthors, too, have paid some attention to the stones in use %0afor mortars, not only those employed for the trituration of %0adrugs and pigments, but for other purposes as well. In this %0arespect they have given the preference to Etesian 4 stone before %0aall others, and, next to that, to Thebaic stone, already men- %0ationed 8 as being called " pyrrhopoecilon," and known as " psa- %0aranus " by some. The third rank has been assigned to chry- %0asites, 0 a stone nearly allied to Chalazian 7 stone. lor medicinal %0apurposes, however, basauites 8 has been preferred, this being a %0astone that remits no particles from its surface. 9 %0a%0aThose stoues which yield a liquid, are generally looked upon %0aas good for the trituration of ophthalmic preparations ; and %0ahence it is, that the ./Ethiopian stone is so much in request for %0athe purpose. Tamarian stone, they say, Phoenician stone, and %0ahaematites, are good for the preparation of those medicinal %0acompositions in which saffron forms an ingredient ; but they %0aalso speak of another Taenarian stone, of a dark colour, which, %0alike Parian 10 stone, is not so well adapted for medicinal pur- %0aposes. We learn from them, too, that Egyptian alabastrites, 11 %0aor white ophites, 12 from the virtues inherent in them, are con- %0asidered still better adapted for these purposes than the kinds %0alust mentioned, It is this kind of ophites, too, from which %0avessels, and casks even, are made. %0a%0a3 "Musta."

[Book XXXVI. %0a%0a%0a%0aCHAP. 44. STONE OF SIPHNOS. SOFT STONES. %0a%0aAt Siplmos, 13 there is a kind of stone 11 which is hollowed %0aand turned in the lathe, for making cooking-utensils and ves- %0asels for keeping provisions ; a thing too, that, to my own know- %0aledge, 15 is done with the green stone 16 of Coinuin 17 in Italy. %0aWith reference, however, to the stone of Siphnos, it is a sin- %0agular fact, that, when heated in oil, though naturally very soft, %0ait becomes hard and black ; so great a difference is there in %0athe qualities of stone. %0a%0aThere are some remarkable instances, too, beyond the Alps, of %0athe natural softness of some kinds of stone. In the province %0aof the Belgse, there is a white stone 18 which admits of being cut %0awith the saw that is used for wood, and with greater facility %0aeven. This stone is used as a substitute for roof-tiles and %0agutter-tiles, and even for the kind of roofing known as the %0apavonaceous 13 style, if that is preferred. Such are the stones %0athat admit of being cut into thin slabs. %0a%0aCHAP. 45. SPECULAR STONES. %0a%0aAs to specular 30 stone — for this, too, is ranked as one of the %0astones — it admits of being divided with still greater facility, %0aand can be split into leaves as thin as may be desired. The %0aprovince of Nearer Spain used formerly to be the only one %0athat furnished it — not, indeed, the whole of that country, but %0aa district extending for a hundred miles around the city of %0aSegobrica. 21 But at the present day, Cyprus, Cappadocia, and %0aSicily, supply us with it ; and, still more recently, it has been %0adiscovered in Africa : they are all, however, looked upon as %0ainferior to the stone which comes from Spain. The sheets %0a%0a13 See B. iv. cc. 22, 23. %0a%0a14 Ajasson identifies it with Ollar stone, talc, or soap-stone, a hydrous %0asilicate of magnesia, and nearly allied to the Ophites of Chapters 11 and 30. %0a%0a15 He being a native of that part of Italy. %0a%0a16 The Green Colubine Ollar stone, or soap-stone of Italy. %0a%0a17 See B. iii. c. 21. %0a%0a18 Identified by Brotero with our Free-stone or grit-stone. %0a%0a19 So called from its resemblance to the spots on a peacock's tail.

This stone is to be found also in the territory of %0aBononia, 22 in Italy ; but in small pieces only, covered with %0aspots and encrusted in a bed of silex, there being a consider- %0aable affinity, it would appear, in their nature. %0a%0aIn Spain, the specular- stone is extracted from shafts sunk %0ain the earth to a very considerable depth ; though it is occa- %0asionally to be found just beneath the surface, enclosed in the %0asolid rock, and extracted without difficulty, or else cut away %0afrom its bed. In most cases, however, it admits of being dug %0aup, being of an isolated nature, and lying in pieces, like rag- %0astone, but never known as yet to exceed five feet in length. %0aIt would appear that this substance is originally a liquid, %0awhich, by an animating power in the earth, becomes congealed %0alike crystal ; and it is very evident that it is the result of pe- %0atrifaction, from the fact that, when animals have fallen into the %0ashafts from which it is extracted, the marrow of their bones %0abecomes transformed into stone of a similar nature, by the end %0aof a single winter. In some cases, too, it is found of a black %0acolour : but the white stone has the marvellous property, soft %0aas it is known to be, of resisting the action of the sun and of %0acold. Nor will it, if it is only protected from accidents, %0abecome deteriorated by lapse of time, a thing that is so gene- %0arally the case with many other kinds of stone that are used %0afor building purposes. The shavings, too, and scales of this %0astone, have been used of late for another purpose ; the Circus %0aMaximus having been strewed with them at the celebration of %0athe games, with the object of producing an agreeable white- %0aness. %0a%0aCHAP. 46. PHENGITES. %0a%0aJ)uring the reign of Nero, there was a stone found in Cappado- %0acia, as hard as marble,white, and transparent even in those parts %0awhere red veins were to be seenupon it; a property which has ob- %0atained for it the name of " phengites." 23 It was with this stone 21 %0a%0a23 Ajasson is of opinion that various kinds of mica and talc are the %0aminerals here alluded to. %0a%0a23 From i>iyydg, " brightness."

WHETSTONES. %0a%0aWe must now pass on to the stones that are employed for %0ahandicrafts, and, first of all, whetstones for sharpening iron. %0aOf these stones there are numerous varieties ; the Cretan stones %0ahaving been long held in the highest estimation, and the next %0abest being those of Mount Taygetus, in Laconia; both of %0awhich are used as hones, and require oil. Among the water- %0awhetstones, the first rank belonged to those of Naxos, and the %0asecond to the stones of Armenia, both of them already 28 men- %0ationed. The stones of Cilicia are of excellent quality, whether %0aused with oil or with water ; those of Arsinoe, 29 too, are very %0agood, but with water only. Whetstones have been found also %0ain Italy, which with water give a remarkably keen edge ; and %0afrom the countries beyond the Alps, we have the whetstones %0aknown as " passernices." 30 %0a%0aTo the fourth class belong the hones which give an edge %0aby the agency of human saliva, and are much in use in bar- %0abers' shops. They are worthless, however, for all other pur- %0aposes, in consequence of their soft and brittle nature : those %0afrom the district of Laminium, 31 in Nearer Spain, are the best %0aof the kind. %0a%0agypseous spar. Suetonius says, c. 14, that Domitian, when he suspected %0athat plots were forming against him, caused the porticos in which he %0awalked to he lined with Phengites, which by its reflection showed what %0awas going on hehind his back. 25 See B. xviii. c. 2. %0a%0a26 See Chapter 24 of this Book. %0a%0a21 Beckmann says, in reference to this passage, supposing that a kind %0aof spar is meant by the word phengites — " It is probable that the openings %0aof the walls of the building where the windows used to be, were in this %0ainstance filled up with phengites, which, by admitting a faint light, pre- %0avented the place from being dark, even when the doors were shut."— Hist. %0aInv.

TOPHUS. %0a%0aAmong the multitude of stones which still remain unde- %0apcribed, there is tophus ; 32 a material totally unsuited for build- %0aing purposes, in consequence of its perishableness. Still, how- %0aever, there are some localities which have no other, Carthage, %0ain Africa, for example. It is eaten away by the emanations %0afrom the sea, crumbled to dust by the wind, and shattered by %0athe pelting of the rain : but human industry has found the %0ameans of protecting walls of houses built of it, with a coating of %0apitch, as a plaster of lime would corrode it. Hence it is, %0athat we have the well-known saying, " that the Carthaginians %0ause pitch 33 for their houses and lime 34 for their wines," this %0alast being the method used by them in the preparation of their %0amust. %0a%0aIn the territories of Fidena? and Alba, in the vicinity of %0aRoine, we find other soft kinds of stone ; and, in Umbria and %0aVenetia, there is a stone 36 which admits of being cut with the %0ateeth of a saw. These stones are easy to be worked, and are %0acapable of supporting a considerable weight, if they are only %0akept sheltered irom the weather. Rain, however, frost, and dew, %0asplit them to pieces, nor can they resist the humidity of the %0asea-air. The stone 36 of Tibur can stand every thirjg except %0aheat, which makes it crack. %0a%0aCHAP. 49. — THE VAEIOUS KINDS OF SILEX. %0a%0aThe black silex 37 is in general the best ; but in some local- %0aities, it is the red, and occasionally the white; as in the %0aAnician quarries at Tarquinii, near Lake Volsinius, 38 for ex- %0aample, and those at Statonia, 39 the stone of which is proof %0aagainst fire even. 40 These stones, sculptured for monumental %0a%0a32 Identical, probably, with the Tufa of modern Mineralogy, which %0athence derives its name, a Carbonate of lime. %0a%0a33 Thus reversing the order of things with the Romans, who put the %0alime on their houses, and the pitch in their wines.

There is a green silex, also, which offers a most %0apowerful resistance to the action of fire, but is never found in %0aany large quantities, and, in all cases, in an isolated form, and %0anot as a constituent part of solid rock. Of the other kinds, %0athe pale silex is but rarely used for erections : being of globu- %0alar form, it is not liable to injury, but at the same time it is %0ainsecure for building purposes, unless it is well braced and %0atightly held together. Nor yet does river silex offer any %0agreater security, for it always has the appearance of being %0awet. %0a%0aCHAP. 50. — OTHEE STONES USED FOR BUILDING. %0a%0aWhen the nature of stone is doubtful, the proper precaution %0ais, to quarry it in summer, and not to use it for building be- %0afore the end of a couple of years, leaving it in the meantime to %0abe well seasoned by the weather. The slabs which have been %0adamaged will be found to be better suited for the foundations %0aunder ground : while those, on the other hand, which have re- %0amained uninjured, may be employed with safety, and exposed %0ato the open air even. %0a%0aCHAP. 51. — THE VARIOUS METHODS OP BUILDING. %0a%0aThe Greeks construct party- walls, resembling those of brick- %0awork, of hard stone or of silex, squared. This kind of stone- %0awork iswhat theycall "isodomon,"" it being "pseudisodomon"" %0awhen the wall is built of materials of unequal dimensions. %0aA third kind of stonework is called " emplecton," 43 the two %0aexteriors only being made with regularity, the rest of the %0amaterial being thrown in at random. It is necessary that %0athe stones should lie over one another alternately, in such a %0away that the middle of one stone meets the point of junction %0aof the two below it ; and this, too, in the middle of the wall, %0aif possible ; but if not, at all events, at the sides. When the %0amiddle of the wall is filled up with broken stones, the work %0ais known as " diatoichon."" %0a%0a41 " Built of stones of equal size." %0a%0a42 " Built of stones of uuequal sizes." %0a%0a43 " Filled up work," apparently. %0a%0a4 * The reading is very doubtful here : for the word seems to mean, in %0aGreek, "From one wall to another." " Diamicton''— " Mixed up " is %0aanother reading.

(23.) — CISTEKNS. %0a%0aCisterns should be made of five parts of pure, gravelly, sand, %0atwo of the very strongest quicklime, and fragments of silex %0anot exceeding a pound each in weight; when thus incor- %0aporated, the bottom and sides should be well beaten with iron %0arammers. The best plan, too, is to have the cisterns double ; %0aso that all superfluities may settle in the inner cistern, and %0athe water filter through, as pure as possible, into the outer %0aone. %0a%0aCHAP. 53. — QUICK-LIME. %0a%0aCato 47 the Censor disapproves of lime prepared from stones %0aof various colours : that made of white stone is the best. %0aLime prepared from hard stone is the best for building pur- %0aposes, and that from porous stone for coats of plaster. For %0aboth these purposes, lime made from silex is equally rejected. %0aStone that has been extracted from quarries furnishes a better %0alime than that collected from the beds of rivers ; but the best of %0aall is the lime that is obtained from the molar-stone, 48 that being %0aof a more unctuous nature than the others. It is something %0atruly marvellous, that quick-lime, after the stone has been sub- %0ajected to fire, should ignite on the application of water ! %0a%0aCHAP. 54. — THE VARIOUS KINDS OF SAND. THE COMBINATIONS %0aOF SAND WITH LIME. %0a%0aThere are three kinds of sand : fossil 49 sand, to which %0aone-fourth part of lime should be added -, 50 river sand ; and %0asea sand ; to both of which last, one third of lime should be %0aadded. If, too, one third of the mortar is composed of bruised %0aearthenware, it will be all the better. Fossil sand is found in %0athe districts that lie between the Apennines and the Padus, %0ahut not in the parts beyond sea. %0a%0a45 Where the outer face of each stone forms an exact square ; the point- %0aings consequently having a netlike or reticulated appearance. %0a%0a46 The vertical pointings or junctures lying one over the other. %0a%0a*' l)e Re Rust. c. 38. 43 See Chapters 29 and 30 of this Book. %0a%0a« To which Pozzuolane belongs. 50 For making mortar. %0a%0a%0a%0a374 %0a%0a%0a%0aPLTNt'8 NATURAL HISTORY. [Book XXXVI. %0a%0a%0a%0aCHAP 55. DEFECTS IN BUILDING. PLASTERS FOR WALLS. %0a%0aThe great cause of the fall of so many buildings in our City, is, %0athat through a fraudulent abstraction of the lime, the rough %0awork is laid without anything to hold it together. The %0aolder, too, the mortar is, the better it is in quality. In the %0aancient laws for the regulation of building, no contractor was %0ato use mortar less than three months old ; hence it is, that no %0acracks have disfigured the plaster coatings of their walls. %0aThese stuccos will never present a sufficiently bright surface, %0aunless there have been three layers of sanded mortar, and two %0aof marbled 51 mortar upon that. In damp localities and places %0asubject to exhalations from the sea, it is the best plan to sub- %0astitute ground earthenware mortar for sanded mortar. In %0aGreece, it is the practice, first to pound the lime and sand used %0afor plastering, with wooden pestles in a large trough. The test %0aby which it is known that marbled mortar has been properly %0ablended, is its not adhering to the trowel ; whereas, if it is %0aonly wanted for white- washing, the lime, after being well %0aslaked with water, should stick like glue. For this last %0apurpose, however, the lime should only be slaked in lumps. %0a%0aAt Elis, there is a Temple of Minerva, which was pargetted, %0athey say, by Panaenus, the brother of Phidias, with a mortar %0athat was blended with milk and saffron : 52 hence it is, that, %0aeven at the present day, when rubbed with spittle on the %0afinger, it yields the smell and flavour of saffron. %0a%0aCHAP. 56. — COLUMNS. THE SEVERAL KINDS OF COLUMNS. %0a%0aThe more closely columns are placed together, the thicker %0athey appear to be. There are four different kinds of pillars. %0aThose of which the diameter at the foot is one-sixth part %0aof the height, are called Doric. When the diameter is one- %0aninth, they are Ionic ; and when it is one-seventh, Tuscan. %0aThe proportions in the Corinthian are the same as those of %0athe Ionic ; but they differ in the circumstance that the %0aCorinthian capitals are of the same height as the diameter %0aat the foot, a thing that gives them a more slender appear- %0aance ; whereas, in the Ionic column, the height of the %0acapital is only one-third of the diameter at the foot.

In addition to these columns, there are what are %0acalled "Attic" columns, quadrangular, and with equal sides. %0a%0aCHAP. 57. (24.) — FIVE REMEDIES DERIVED FROM LIME. %0a%0aLime is also employed very extensively in medicine. For %0athis purpose, fresh lime is selected, which has not been slaked %0awith water. Its properties are caustic, resolvent, and attrac- %0ative ; and it prevents serpiginous ulcers from spreading, being %0aincorporated with vinegar and oil of roses, for the purpose. %0aWhen this has been effected, it is tempered with wax and oil of %0aroses, and applied to promote cicatrization. In combination %0awith honey, and liquid resin, or hogs' lard, lime is curative of %0asprains and scrofulous sores. %0a%0aCHAP. 58. MALTHA. %0a%0aMaltha 51 is a cement prepared from fresh lime ; lumps of %0awhich are quenched in wine, and then pounded with hogs' %0alard and figs, both of them, mollifying substances. 55 It is the %0amost tenacious of all cements, and surpasses stone in hardness. %0aBefore applying the maltha, the substance upon which it is %0aused must be well rubbed with oil. %0a%0a53 It seems difficult to understand whether hy the word " spirse" he %0ameans astragals, or bases. It would almost appear, by the use of the word %0a" subditae," that it is " bases" for the shafts. It is just possible, how- %0aever, that the meaning may be that the " spira" were placed beneath the %0acapitals which were added. %0a%0a51 A different thing altogether from the Maltha or Pissasphalt of B. ii. %0ac. 108. Festus describes it as a mixture of pitch and wax ; and Palladius, %0ain B. i. c. 17, speaks of it as being composed of tar, grease, and lime %0aboiled ; and in c. 35 he describes Maltha caldaria as a mixture of hammo- %0aniacum, figs, tow, tar, and melted suet. It was probably a general name for %0aseveral kinds of cement. Heineccius says that it was employed for seal- %0aing, but on what authority does not appear. See Beckmann, Hist. Inv. %0aVol. I. p. 141. Bohn's Edition. %0a%0a55 This is perhaps the meaning of " duplici lenimento." The reading, %0ahowever, is doubtful. %0a%0a%0a%0a376 %0a%0a%0a%0apliny's NATVJKAL HISTOEY. [Book XXXVI. %0a%0a%0a%0aCHAP. 59. GYPSUM. %0a%0aGypsum 56 has a close affinity with limestone, and there are %0anumerous varieties of it. One kind is prepared from a cal- %0acined 57 stone, as in Syria, and at Thurii, for example. In %0aCyprus and at Perrhsebia, 68 gypsum is dug out of the earth, %0aand at Tymphsea 69 it is found just below the level of the sod. %0aThe stone that is calcined for this purpose, ought to be very %0asimilar to alabastrites, 60 or else of a grain like that of marble. %0aIn Syria, they select the hardest stones for the purpose, and %0acalcine them with cow-dung, to accelerate the process. Ex- %0aperience has proved, however, that the best plaster of all is %0athat prepared from specular-stone, 41 or any other stone that is %0asimilarly laminated. Gypsum, when moistened, must be used %0aimmediately, as it hardens with the greatest rapidity; it %0aadmits, however, of being triturated over again, and so reduced %0ato powder. It is very useful for pargetting, and has a %0apleasing effect when used for ornamental figures and wreaths %0ain buildings. %0a%0aThere is one remarkable fact connected with this substance ; %0aCaius Proculeius, 62 an intimate friend of the Emperor Augustus, %0asuffering from violent pains in the stomach, swallowed gyp- %0asum, and so put an end to his existence. 63 %0a%0aCHAP. 60.

That pavements had come into common use be- %0afore the Cimbric War, and that a taste for them was very %0aprevalent, is evident from the line of Lucilius— %0a%0a»' "With cliecquered emblems like a pavement marked." 70 %0a%0aCHAP. 62. — TERRACE-ROOF PAVEMENTS. %0a%0aThe Greeks have also invented terrace-roof 11 pavements, and %0ahave covered their houses with them ; a thing that may easily be %0adone in the hotter climates, but a great mistake in countries %0awhere the rain is apt to become congealed. In making these %0apavements, the proper plan is to begin with two layers of boards, %0arunning different ways, and nailed at the extremities, to prevent %0athem from warping. Upon this planking a rough-work muat %0abe laid, one-fourth of which consists of pounded pottery : and %0aupon this, another bed of rough-work, two-fifths composed of %0alime, a foot in thickness, and well beaten down with the %0arammer.

The %0ageneral opinion is, that oak 73 should never be used for the %0aplanking, it being so very liable to warp ; and it is considered %0aa good plan to cover the boards with a layer of fern or chaff, %0athat they may be the better able to resist the action of the %0alime. It is necessary, too, before putting down the planking, %0ato underset it with a bed of round pebbles.

The ground is well rammed down, %0aand a bed of rough work, or else broken pottery, is then laid %0aupon it. Upon the top of this, a layer of charcoal is placed, %0awell trodden down with a mixture of sand, lime, and ashes; care %0abeing taken, by line and rule, to give it a uniform thickness %0aof half a foot. The surface then presents the ordinary ap- %0apearance of the ground ; but if it is well rubbed with the %0apolishing-stone, it will have all the appearance of a black %0apavement. %0a%0aCHAP. 64.

Since his time, these %0amosaics have left the ground for the arched roofs of houses, %0aand they are now made of glass. This, however, is but a %0arecent invention ; for there can be no doubt that, when Agrippa %0aordered the earthenware walls of the hot baths, in the %0aThermae which he was building at Eome, to be painted in %0aencaustic, and had the other parts coated with pargetting, he %0a%0a73 " Quercus." %0a%0a11 " Spicata testacea." These pavements were probably so called be- %0acause the bricks were laid at angles to each other (of about forty-five %0adegrees), like the grains in an ear of wheat ; or like the spines projecting %0afrom either side of the back-bone of a fish.

It will be as well, therefore, to give %0asome account, also, of glass. %0a%0aCHAP. 65. (26.) THE OBIGIN OF GLASS. %0a%0aIn Syria there is a region known as Phcenice, 77 adjoining to %0aJudoea, and enclosing, between the lower ridges of Mount %0aCarmelus, a marshy 7 district known by the name of Cendebia. %0aIn this district, it is supposed, rises the river Belus, 78 which, %0aafter a course of five miles, empties itself into the sea near the %0acolony of Ptolemais. The tide of this river is sluggish, and %0athe water unwholesome to drink, but held sacred for the %0aobservance of certain religious ceremonials. Full of slimy %0adeposits, and very deep, it is only at the reflux of the tide %0athat the river discloses its sands; which, agitated by the %0awaves, separate themselves from their impurities, and so %0abecome cleansed. It is generally thought that it is the %0aacridity of the sea- water that has this purgative effect upon %0athe sand, and that without this action no use could be made %0aof it. The shore upon which this sand is gathered is not %0amore than half a mile in extent ; and yet, for many ages, this %0awas the only spot that afforded the material for making glass. i %0a%0aThe story is, that a ship, laden with nitre, 19 being moored %0aupon this spot, the merchants, while preparing their repast %0aupon the sea-shore, finding no stones at hand for supporting %0atheir cauldrons, employed for the purpose some lumps of nitre %0awhich they had taken from the vessel. Upon its being sub- %0ajected to the action of the fire, in combination with the sand %0aof the sea-shore, they beheld transparent streams flowing forth %0aof a liquid hitherto unknown : this, it is said, was the origin %0aof glass. 80 %0a%0a76 In Chapter 24 of this Book. 11 See B. v. c. 17. %0a%0a78 See B. v. c. 19. %0a%0a79 A mineral alkali, Beckmann thinks ; for it could not possibly be our %0asaltpetre, he says.

In a %0asimilar manner, too, brilliant stones of various descriptions %0acame to be added in the melting, and, at last, shells and fossil %0asand. Some authors tell us, that the glass of India is made of %0abroken crystal, and that, in consequence, there is none that %0acan be compared to it. %0a%0aIn fusing it, light and dry wood is used for fuel, Cyprian %0acopper and nitre being added to the melting, nitre of Ophir 83 %0amore particularly. It is melted, like copper, in contiguous %0afurnaces, and a swarthy mass of an unctuous appearance is the %0aresult. Of such a penetrating nature is the molten glass, that %0ait will cut to the very bone any part of the body which it %0amay come near, and that, too, before it is even felt. This %0amass is again subjected to fusion in the furnace, for the pur- %0apose of colouring it ; after which, the glass is either blown %0ainto various forms, turned in a lathe, or engraved 84 like silver. %0aSidon was formerly famous for its glass-houses, for it was this %0aplace that first invented 85 mirrors. %0a%0a81 " Magnes lapis." See B. xxxiv. c. 42, and Chapter 25 of this Book. %0aBeckmann is of opinion that an ore of Manganese is meant, a substance %0awhich has a resemblance to the magnet, and is of the greatest utility ia %0amaking glass. Hist. Inv. Vol. II. p. 237. %0a%0a82 This appears to be the meaning of " Quoniam in se liquorem vitri %0aquoque utferrum trahere creditur." %0a%0a83 In the description given by Isidorusin the " Origines," which in other %0arespects is similar, these words are omitted, and it is possible that they are %0aa gloss by some one who was better acquainted with the Old Testament %0athan with Pliny. On the other hand, as Sillig remarks, the Phoenicians %0amay, at an early period, have imported into Greece a substance which they %0acalled " nitre of Ophir." %0a%0a8i See Beckmann, Hist. Inv. Vol. II. p. 84. %0a%0a85 " Excogitaverat." Beckmann would seem to give this word the %0aforce only of " thought of," for he gives it as his opinion that attempts %0awere made at Sidon to form glass mirrors, but that the experiments had %0anot completely succeeded. " Had this invention formed an epoch in the %0aart of making mirrors, Pliny, in another place (B. xxxiii. c. 45), where %0ahe describes the various improvements of it so fully, would not have omit- %0ated it: but of those experiments he makes no further mention." He ako %0aexpresses an opinion that the Sidonian mirrors consisted of dark-coloured %0a%0a%0a%0aOhap. 67.J %0a%0a%0a%0aOBSIAJT GLASS. %0a%0a%0a%0a381 %0a%0a%0a%0aSuch was the ancient method of making glass: but, at the %0apresent day, there is found a very white sand for the purpose, %0aat the mouth of the river Volturuus, in Italy. It spreads %0aover an extent of six miles, upon the sea-shore that lies %0abetween Cumae and Liternum, and is prepared for use by %0apounding it with a pestle and mortar; which done, it is mixed %0awith three parts of nitre, either by weight or measure, and, %0awhen fused, is transferred to another furnace. Here it forms %0aa mass of what is called " hammonitrum ;" which is again %0asubmitted to fusion, and becomes a mass of pure, white, glass. %0aIndeed, at the present day, throughout the Gallic and Spanish %0aprovinces even, we find sand subjected to a similar process. %0aIn the reign of Tiberius, it is said, a combination was devised %0awhich produced a flexible 86 glass ; but the manufactory of the %0aartist was totally destroyed, we are told, in order to prevent the %0avalue of copper, silver, and gold, from becoming depreciated." %0aThis story, however, was, for a long time, more widely spread %0athan well authenticated. But be it as it may, it is of little %0aconsequence ; for, in the time of the Emperor Nero, there was a %0aprocess discovered, by which two small glass cups were made, %0aof the kind called " petroti." 88 the price of which was no less %0athan six thousand sesterces ! %0a%0aCHAP 67. — OBSIAN GLASS AND OBSIAN STONE. %0a%0aAmong the various kinds of glass, we may also reckon %0aObsian glass, a substance very similar to the stone 89 which %0aObsius discovered in ^Ethiopia. This stone is of a very dark %0acolour, and sometimes transparent; but it is dull to the sight, %0aand reflects, when attached as a mirror to walls, the shadow %0aof the object rather than the image. Many persons use it 90 %0a%0aglass, resembling obsidian stone.'*— Hist. Inv.

Tiberius Caesar, too, restored to the people %0aof Hcliopolis, as an object of ceremonial worship, an image in %0athis stone, which had been found among the propert) r left by %0aone of the praefects of Egypt. It was a figure of Menelaiis ; a %0acircumstance which goes fur towards proving that the use of %0athis material is of more ancient date than is generally sup- %0aposed, confounded as it is at the present day with glass, by %0areason of its resemblance. Xenocrates says that Obsian stone %0ais found in India also, and in Samnium in Italy; and that it %0ais a natural product of Spain, upon the coasts which border %0aon the Ocean. 92 %0a%0aThere is an artificial Obsian stone, made of coloured glass %0afor services for the table ; and there is also a glass that is red %0aall through, and opaque, known as " hsematinum." 93 A dead %0awhite glass, too, is made, as also other kinds in imitation of mur- %0arhine 94 colour, hyacinthine, sapphire, and every other tint: %0aindeed, there is no material of a more pliable 95 nature than %0athis, or better suited for colouring. Still, however, the %0ahighest value is set upon glass that is entirely colourless and %0atransparent, as nearly as possible resembling crystal, in fact. %0aFor drinking-vessels, glass lias quite superseded the use of %0asilver and gold ; but it is unable to stand heat unless a %0acold liquid is poured in first. And yet, we find that globular %0aglass vessels, filled with water, when brought in contact with %0athe rays of the sun, 96 become heated to such a degree as to %0acause articles of clothing to ignite.

MARVELLOUS FACTS CONNECTED WITH FIRE. %0a%0aHaving now described all the creations of human ingenuity, %0areproductions, in fact, of Nature by the agency of art, it %0acannot but recur to us, with a feeling of admiration, that there %0ais hardly any process which is not perfected through the %0aintervention of fire. Submit to its action some sandy soil, %0aand in one place it will yield glass, in another silver, in %0aanother minium, and in others, again, lead and its several %0avarieties, pigments, and numerous medicaments. It is through %0athe agency of fire that stones 98 are melted into copper; by fire %0athat iron is produced, and subdued to our purposes ; by fire %0athat gold is purified ; by fire, too, that the stone is calcined, %0awhich is to hold together the Avails of our houses. %0a%0aSome materials, again, are all the better for being repeatedly %0asubmitted to the action of fire ; and the same substance will %0ayield one product at the first fusion, another at the second, and %0aanother at the third. 99 Charcoal, when it has passed through fire %0aand has been quenched, only begins to assume its active pro- %0aperties ; and, when it might be supposed to have been reduced %0ato annihilation, it is then that it has its greatest energies.

Witness the gladiators, for %0aexample, who, when disabled at the Games, refresh themselves %0awith this drink." Carbuncle too, a kind of disease which, as %0aalready 3 stated, has recently carried off two persons of consular %0arank, admits of being successfully treated with oak-charcoal, 4 %0atriturated with honey.

In the reign of Tarqui- %0anius Priscus, it is said, there appeared upon his hearth a re- %0asemblance of the male generative organ in the midst of the %0aashes. The captive Ocrisia, a servant of Queen Tanaquil, who %0ahappened to be sitting there, arose from her seat in a state of %0apregnancy, and became the mother of Servius Tullius, who even- %0atually succeeded to the throne. 6 It is stated, too, that while the %0achild was sleeping in the palace, a flame was seen playiDg %0around his head ; the consequence of which was, that it was %0abelieved that the Lar of the household was his progenitor. It %0awas owing to this circumstance, we are informed, that the %0aCompitalia, 6 games in honour of the Lares, were instituted. %0a%0aSummabt. — Remedies mentioned, eighty-nine.

LUXURY DISPLAYED IN THE USE OF VARIOUS KINDS %0a%3c %0a%3c OF MARBLE. %0a%3c %0a%3c It now remains for us to speak of stones, or, in other words, %0a%3c the leading folly of the day ; to say nothing at all of our taste %0a%3c for gems and amber, crystal and murrhine vases. 1 For every- %0a%3c thing of which we have previously treated, down to the %0a%3c present Book, may, by some possibility or other, have the ap- %0a%3c pearance of having been created for the sake of man : but^ as %0a%3c to the mountains, Nature has made those for herself, as a kind %0a%3c of bulwark for keeping together the bowels of the earth; as %0a%3c also for the purpose of curbing the violence of the rivers, of %0a%3c breaking the waves of the sea, and so, by opposing to them %0a%3c the very hardest of her materials, putting a check upon those %0a%3c elements which are never at rest. And yet we must hew %0a%3c down these mountains, forsooth, and carry them off; and this, %0a%3c for no other reason than to gratify our luxurious inclinations : %0a%3c heights which in former days it was reckoned a miracle even to %0a%3c have crossed ! %0a%3c %0a%3c Our forefathers regarded as a prodigy the passage of the %0a%3c Alps, first by Hannibal, 2 and, more recently, by the Cimbri : %0a%3c but at the present day, these very mountains are cut asunder %0a%3c to yield us a thousand different marbles, promontories are %0a%3c thrown open to the sea, and the face of Nature is being every- %0a%3c where reduced to a level. "We now carry away the barriers %0a%3c that were destined for the separation of one nation from %0a%3c another; we construct ships for the transport of our marbles ; %0a%3c and, amid the waves, the most boisterous element of Nature, %0a%3c we convey the summits of the mountains to and fro : a thing, %0a%3c however, that is even less unpardonable than to go on the %0a%3c %0a%3c 1 See B. xxxvii. cc. 7, 8, 11. %0a%3c %0a%3c 2 See the lines of Juvenal, Sat. x. 1. 151, etseq. %0a%3c %0a%3c VOL.

Let each reflect, when he hears of the %0a%3c high prices set upon these things, when he sees these ponderous %0a%3c masses carted and carried away, how many there are whose %0a%3c life is passed far more happily without them. For what %0a%3c utility or for what so-called pleasure do mortals make them- %0a%3c selves the agents, or, more truly speaking, the victims of such %0a%3c undertakings, except in order that others may take their re- %0a%3c pose in the midst of variegated stones ? Just as though too, the %0a%3c shades of night, which occupy one half of each man's existence, %0a%3c would forbear to curtail these imaginary delights. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 2. — WHO WAS THE FIRST TO EMPLOY MARBLE IN PUBLIC %0a%3c BUILDINGS. %0a%3c %0a%3c Indeed, while making these reflections, one cannot but feel %0a%3c ashamed of the men of ancient times even. There are still in %0a%3c existence censorial 4 laws, which forbid the kernels 5 in the %0a%3c neck of swine to be served at table, dormice too, and other %0a%3c things too trifling to mention : and yet there has been no law %0a%3c passed, forbidding marble to be imported, or the seas to be %0a%3c traversed in search of it ! %0a%3c %0a%3c (2.) It may possibly be observed, that this was, because %0a%3c marble was not then introduced. Such, however, is not the %0a%3c fact ; for in the aedileship of M. Scaurus, 6 three hundred and %0a%3c sixty columns were to be seen imported ; for the decorations of %0a%3c a temporary theatre, too, one that was destined to be in use for %0a%3c barely a single month. And yet the laws were silent thereon ; %0a%3c in a spirit of indulgence for the amusements of the public, no %0a%3c doubt. But then, why such indulgence? or how do vices %0a%3c more insidiously steal upon us than under the plea of serving %0a%3c the public ? By what other way, in fact, did ivory, gold, and %0a%3c precious stones, first come into use with private individuals ? %0a%3c %0a%3c Can we say that there is now anything that we have re- %0a%3c served for the exclusive use of the gods r. However, be it so, %0a%3c let us admit of this indulgence for the amusements of the %0a%3c public; but still, why did the laws maintain their silence %0a%3c %0a%3c 3 lie alludes to vessels made of crystal, -which, as Dalechamps remarks, %0a%3c was long supposed to be nothing but iGe in a concrete form.

And yet the laws still preserved their %0a%3c silence, when such enormous masses as these were being car- %0a%3c ried past the earthenware 9 pediments of the temples of the %0a%3c gods, to the house of a private individual ! %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 3.

Already %0a%3c had L. Crassus, 10 the orator, he who was the first to possess %0a%3c pillars of foreign marble, and in this same Palatium too, re- %0a%3c ceived from M. Brutus, on the occasion of a dispute, the nick- %0a%3c name of the "Palatine Venus," for his indulgence in this %0a%3c kind of luxury. The material, I should remark, was Hymet- %0a%3c tian marble, and the pillars were but six in number, and not %0a%3c exceeding some twelve feet in height. Our forefathers were %0a%3c guilty of this omission, no doubt, because morals were univer- %0a%3c sally contaminated ; and, seeing that things which had been in- %0a%3c terdicted had been forbidden in vain, they preferred the absence %0a%3c of laws to laws that were no better than a dead letter. These %0a%3c particulars and others in the 6equel will show that we are so %0a%3c far improved ; for who is there at the present day that has, in %0a%3c his atrium, any such massive columns as these of Scaurus ? %0a%3c %0a%3c But before proceeding to treat of the several varieties of this %0a%3c material, it will be as well to mention the various artists, and %0a%3c the degrees of estimation in which they are held, who have %0a%3c worked in marble. We will, therefore, proceed to review the %0a%3c sculptors who have flourished at different periods. %0a%3c %0a%3c 1 See Chapter 8 of this Book. 8 In the Eleventh Eegion of the City. %0a%3c * See B. xxxv. cc. 43, 4o. 10 See B. xvii. c. 1. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 308 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c pliny's natural history.

THE MAUSOLEUM IN CARIA. THE MOST CKLK- %0a%3c BRATED SCULPTORS AND WORKS IN MARBLE, TWO HUNDRED AND %0a%3c TWENTY-FIVE IN NUMBER. %0a%3c %0a%3c The first artists who distinguished themselves in the sculp- %0a%3c ture of marble, were Dipcenus 11 and Scyllis, natives of the Isle %0a%3c of Crete. At this period the Medians were still in power, and %0a%3c Cyrus had not begun to reign in Persia ; their date being about %0a%3c the fiftieth Olympiad. They afterwards repaired to Sicyon, a %0a%3c state which for a length of time 12 was the adopted country of %0a%3c all such pursuits as these. The people of Sicyon had made a %0a%3c contract with them for the execution of certain statues of the %0a%3c gods ; but, before completing the work, the artists complained %0a%3c of some injustice being done them, and retired to iEtolia. Im- %0a%3c mediately upon this, the state was afflicted with sterility and %0a%3c famine, and dreadful consternation was the result. Upon %0a%3c enquiry being made as to a remedy for these evils, the Pythian %0a%3c Apollo made answer, that Dipcenus and Scyllis must complete %0a%3c the statues of the gods ; an object which was attained at the %0a%3c cost of great concessions and considerable sums of money. %0a%3c The statues were those of Apollo, 13 Diana, Hercules, and %0a%3c Minerva; the last of which was afterwards struck by %0a%3c lightning. %0a%3c %0a%3c (5.) Before these artists were in existence, there had already %0a%3c appeared Melas, a sculptor of the Isle of Chios; and, in succes- %0a%3c sion to him, his son Micciades, and his grandson Archermus; 14 %0a%3c whose sons, Bupalus and Athenis, afterwards attained the highest %0a%3c eminence in the art. These last were contemporaries of the %0a%3c poet Hipponax, who, it is well known, lived in the sixtieth %0a%3c Olympiad. Now, if a person only reckons, going upwards %0a%3c from their time to that of their great-grandfather, he will find %0a%3c %0a%3c 11 These two artists are invariably mentioned together. Pausanias, B. %0a%3c ii. c. 1^ and B. iii. c. 17, speaks of them as the pupils or sons of Dffida- %0a%3c lus ; only intimating thereby, as Sillig thinks, that they Avere the first %0a%3c sculptors -worthy of being associated with the father of artists. Pausanias, %0a%3c B. ii. c. 22, mentions ebony statues by them. %0a%3c %0a%3c 13 In the time of the Telchines, before the arrival of Inachus in Argolis. %0a%3c %0a%3c 13 Pausanias says that tbis statue was completed by their pupils.

Of many of these sculptors, no %0a%3c further particulars are known. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 4 ] AUTIST3 WHO EXCELLED IN SCELPTTJEE. 309 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c that the art of sculpture must have necessarily originated about %0a%3c the commencement of the era of the Olympiads. Hipponax %0a%3c being a man notorious for his ugliness, the two artists, by way %0a%3c of joke, 15 exhibited a statue of him for the ridicule of the pub- %0a%3c lie. Indignant at this, the poet emptied upon them all the %0a%3c bitterness of his verses ; to such an extent indeed, that, as %0a%3c some believe, they were driven to hang themselves in despair. %0a%3c This, however, is not the fact ; for, at a later period, these %0a%3c artists executed a number of statues in the neighbouring islands ; %0a%3c atDelos for example, with an inscription subjoined to the effect, %0a%3c that Chios was rendered famous not only by its vines 15 * but by %0a%3c the works of the sons of Archermus as well. The people of %0a%3c Lasos 16 still show a Diana that was made by them ; and we %0a%3c find mention also made of a Diana at Chios, the work of their %0a%3c hands : it is erected on an elevated spot, and the features ap- %0a%3c pear stern to a person as he enters, and joyous as he departs. %0a%3c At Rome, there are some statues by these artists on the summit %0a%3c of the Temple 17 of the Palatine Apollo, and, indeed, in most of %0a%3c the buildings that were erected by the late Emperor Augustus. %0a%3c At Delos and in the Isle, of Lesbos there were formerly some %0a%3c sculptures by their father to be seen. Ambracia too, Argos, %0a%3c andCleonse, were filled with productions of the sculptor Dipoenus. %0a%3c %0a%3c All these artists, however, used nothing but the white marble %0a%3c of the Isle of Paros, a stone which was known as " lychnites" %0a%3c at first, because, according to Varro, it was cut in the quarries %0a%3c by lamplight. 18 Since their time, many other whiter marbles %0a%3c have been discovered, and very recently that of the quarries %0a%3c of Luna 19 With reference to the marble of Paros, there is one %0a%3c very marvellous circumstance related ; in a single block that %0a%3c was split with wedges, a figure 20 of Silenusmade its appearance. %0a%3c %0a%3c 1* Another cause of the quarrel is said to have been the refusal of Bu- %0a%3c palus to give his daughter in marriage to Hipponax.

Indeed, it is said, %0a%3c that Phidias himself worked in marble, and that there is a %0a%3c Venus of his at Eome, a work of extraordinary beauty, in the %0a%3c buildings of Octavia. 22 A thing, however, that is universally %0a%3c admitted, is the fact that he was the instructor of Alcamenes," %0a%3c the Athenian, one of the most famous among the sculptors. %0a%3c By this last artist, there are numerous statues in the temples %0a%3c at Athens ; as also, without the walls there, the celebrated %0a%3c Venus, known as the Aphrodite sv xjjto/s, 21 a work to which %0a%3c Phidias himself, it is said, put the finishing hand. Another %0a%3c disciple also of Phidias was Agoracritus 25 of Paros, a great %0a%3c favourite with his master, on account of his extremely youthful %0a%3c age; and for which reason, it is said, Phidias gave his own name %0a%3c to many of that artist's works. The two pupils entering into a %0a%3c contest as to the superior execution of a statue of Venus, %0a%3c Alcamenes was successful ; not that his work was superior, but %0a%3c because his fellow-citizens chose to give their suffrages in his %0a%3c favour in preference to a stranger. It was for this reason, it %0a%3c is said, that Agoracritus sold his statue, on the express condi- %0a%3c tion that it should never be taken to Athens, and changed its %0a%3c name to that of Nemesis. 26 It was accordingly erected at %0a%3c Ehamnus, 27 a borough of Attica, and M. Varro has considered %0a%3c it superior to every other statue.

Pausanias, B. i. c. 33, stirs that it %0a%3c was the work of Phidias, and that it was made of Parian marble, which %0a%3c the Persians had brought into Attica for the purpose of erecting a trophy. %0a%3c Strabo, however, in B. ix., says that it was the work of Agoracritus and %0a%3c Diodotus (an artist otherwise unknown), and that it was not at all inferior %0a%3c to the production of Phidias. Tzetzes again, Suidas, and Photius, say %0a%3c that it was the work of Phidias, and that it was presented by him to his %0a%3c favourite pupil, Agoracritus. Sillig rejects the story of the contest, and %0a%3c the decision by the suffrages of the Athenian people. Some modern %0a%3c writers have doubted also, whether a statue of Venus could be modified so %0a%3c as to represent Nemesis; but not with sufficient reasoD, Sillig thinks. %0a%3c %0a%3c * See B. iv. c. 11. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 4.] ATtTISTS WHO EXCELLED IN SCULPTURE. 311 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c the Temple of the Great Mother, in the same city, another %0a%3c work 28 by Agoracritus. %0a%3c %0a%3c Among all nations which the fame of the Olympian Jupiter %0a%3c has reached, Phidias is looked upon, beyond all doubt, as %0a%3c the most famous of artists : but to let those who have never %0a%3c even seen his works, know how deservedly he is esteemed, %0a%3c we will take this opportunity of adducing a few slight proofs %0a%3c of the genius which he displayed. In doing this, we shall %0a%3c not appeal to the beauty of his Olympian Jupiter, nor yet to %0a%3c the vast proportions of his Athenian Miner va, six and twenty %0a%3c cubits in height, and composed of ivory and gold ; but it is to %0a%3c the shield of this last statue that we shall draw attention ; %0a%3c upon the convex face of which he has chased a combat of the %0a%3c Amazons, while, upon the concave side of it, he has repre- %0a%3c sented the battle between the Gods and the Giants. Upon %0a%3c the sandals again, we see the wars of the Lapithae and %0a%3c Centaurs, so careful has he been to fill every smallest portion %0a%3c of his work with some proof or other of his artistic skill. To %0a%3c the story chased upon the pedestal of the statue, the name of %0a%3c the "Birth of Pandora"* 9 has been given; and the figures %0a%3c of new-born 30 gods to be seen upon it are no less than twenty %0a%3c in number. The figure of Victory, in particular, is most %0a%3c admirable, and connoisseurs are greatly struck with the ser- %0a%3c pent and the sphinx in bronze lying beneath the point of %0a%3c the spear. Let thus much be said incidentally in reference to %0a%3c an artist who can never be sufficiently praised ; if only to let %0a%3c it be understood that the richness of his genius was always %0a%3c equal to itself, even in the very smallest details. %0a%3c %0a%3c "When speaking 31 of the statuaries, we have already given %0a%3c the period at which Praxiteles flourished ; an artist, who, in %0a%3c the glory which he acquired by his works in marble, sur- %0a%3c passed even himself. There are some works of his in the %0a%3c Ceramicus 32 at Athens ; but, superior to all the statues, not %0a%3c only of Praxiteles, but of any other artist that ever existed, %0a%3c is his Cnidian Venus ; for the inspection of which, many per- %0a%3c sons before now have purposely undertaken a voyage to %0a%3c %0a%3c 28 A statue, Sillig supposes, of the goddess Cybele. %0a%3c %0a%3c 29 " Pandoras Genesis." . %0a%3c %0a%3c 30 Sillig is of opinion that this passage is corrupt, and is inclined^ to %0a%3c think, with Panofka, that the reading should be "nascenti adstautes,"— %0a%3c gods "standing by the new-born" Pandora. %0a%3c %0a%3c « In B. xxxiv. c. 19. 32 See P>. xxxv. c. 4o. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 312 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c PLINY'S NATURAL HISTORY. [Book XXXVI. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Cnidos. The artist made two statues of the goddess, and %0a%3c offered them both for sale: one of them was represented %0a%3c with drapery, 33 and for this reason was preferred 34 by the people %0a%3c of Cos, who had the choice ; the second was offered them at %0a%3c the same price, but, on the grounds of propriety and modesty, %0a%3c they thought fit to choose the other. Upon this, the Cnidians %0a%3c purchased the rejected statue, 35 and immensely superior has it %0a%3c always been held in general estimation. At a later period, %0a%3c King Nicomedes wished to purchase this statue of the Cni- %0a%3c dians, and made them an offer to pay off the whole of their %0a%3c public debt, which was very large. They preferred, however, %0a%3c to submit to any extremity rather than part with it ; and with %0a%3c good reason, for by this statue Praxiteles has perpetuated the %0a%3c glory of Cnidos. The little temple in which it, is placed is %0a%3c open on all sides, so that the beauties 36 of the statue admit of %0a%3c %0a%3c 33 " Velata specie." There has been much discussion about the mean- %0a%3c ing of these words ; and Sillig is of opinion that the figure was repre- %0a%3c sented draped in a garment, which, while it seemed designed to hide the %0a%3c person, really exposed it to view. This dress would not improbably re- %0a%3c commend it additionally to the inhabitants of Cos, who were skilled in %0a%3c making the Com vestes, garments which, while they covered the body, re- %0a%3c vealed its naked charms. See further mention of them in B. ix. c. 26. %0a%3c %0a%3c 34 Visconti thinks that a statue still preserved in the Royal Museum at %0a%3c Paris, is a copy of the Coan Venus. It has, however, a figure of Cupid %0a%3c associated with it, which, as Sillig observes, militates against the suppo- %0a%3c sition. %0a%3c %0a%3c 35 The ancient writers abound in praises of this wonderful statue. %0a%3c Lucian, however, has given the most complete and artistic description of %0a%3c it. It was supposed by the ancients, to represent Venus as standing be- %0a%3c fore Paris, when he awarded to her the prize of beauty ; but it has been %0a%3c well remarked, that the drapery in the right hand, and the vase by the %0a%3c side of the figure, indicate that she has either just left or is about to enter %0a%3c the bath. The artist modelled it from Phryne, a courtesan or hetsera of %0a%3c Athens, of whom he was greatly enamoured. It was ultimately carried %0a%3c to Constantinople, where it perished by fire in the reign of Justinian. It %0a%3c is doubtful whether there are any copies of it in existence. There is, %0a%3c however, a so-called copy in the gardens of the Vatican, and another in %0a%3c the Glyptothek, at Munich. A Venus in the Museo Pio-Clementino, at %0a%3c Rome, is considered by Visconti and others to have been a copy of the %0a%3c Cnidian Venus, with the addition of drapery. It is supposed that Cleo- %0a%3c menes, in making the Venus de Medici, imitated the Cnidian Venus in %0a%3c some degree. %0a%3c %0a%3c 36 There are numerous Epigrams in reference to this statue in the Greek %0a%3c Anthology ; the most striking line in any of which is the beautiful Pen- %0a%3c tameter : %0a%3c %0a%3c %3ct>tv\ %3cp(vl irov yvfivr/v eide TTpaStrtXjjc; %0a%3c " Alas ! where has Praxiteles me naked seen i" %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 4.] AETIST8 WIIO EXCELLED IN SCCLKTUBE. 313 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c being seen from every point of view ; an arrangement which %0a%3c was favoured by the goddess herself, it is generally believed. %0a%3c Indeed, from whatever point it is viewed, its execution is %0a%3c equally worthy of admiration. A certain individual, it is %0a%3c said, became enamoured of this statue, and, concealing himself %0a%3c in the temple during the night, gratified his lustful passion %0a%3c upon it, traces of which are to be seen in a stain left upon %0a%3c the marble. 37 %0a%3c %0a%3c There are also at Cnidos some other statues in marble, the %0a%3c productions of illustrious artists ; a Father Liber 38 by Bryaxis, 39 %0a%3c another by Scopas, 40 and a Minerva by the same hand : indeed, %0a%3c there is no greater proof of the supreme excellence of the %0a%3c Venus of Praxiteles than the fact that, amid such productions %0a%3c as these, it is the only one that we generally find noticed. %0a%3c By Praxiteles, too, there is a Cupid, a statue which occa- %0a%3c sioned 41 one of the charges brought by Cicero against Verres, %0a%3c and for the sake of seeing which persons used to visit Thespiae: %0a%3c at the present day, it is to be seen in the Schools 42 of Octavia. %0a%3c By the same artist there is also another Cupid, without %0a%3c drapery, at Parium, a colony of the Propontis ; equal to the %0a%3c Cnidian Venus in the fineness of its execution, and said to have %0a%3c been the object of a similar outrage. For one Alcetas, a %0a%3c Bhodian, becoming deeply enamoured of it, left upon the %0a%3c marble similar traces of the violence of his passion. %0a%3c %0a%3c At Rome there are, by Praxiteles, a Flora, a Triptolemus, %0a%3c and a Ceres, in the Gardens of Servilius ; statues of Good %0a%3c Success 43 and Good Fortune, in the Capitol ; as also some %0a%3c Maenades, 44 and figures known as Thyiades 45 and Caryatides j 16 %0a%3c %0a%3c 37 Lucian, Valerius Maximus, and Athenaeus, tell the same improbable %0a%3c story, borrowing it from Posidippus the historian. 38 Bacchus. %0a%3c %0a%3c 3» See B. xxxiv. c. 19. 40 See B. xxxiv. c. 19. %0a%3c %0a%3c 41 Pliny is mistaken here : for in the time of Cicero, as we find in Verr. %0a%3c 4, 2, 4, the Thespian Cupid was still at Thespiae, in Beeotia, where it had %0a%3c been dedicated by Phryne, and was not removed to Rome till the time of %0a%3c the emperors. It was the Parian Cupid, originally made for the people of %0a%3c Parium, that, after coming into the possession of Heius, a rich Sicilian, %0a%3c was forcibly taken from him by Verres. %0a%3c %0a%3c 42 Where it was destroyed by fire in the reign of Titus.

There is, by him, at Pergamus, a splendid Group" of %0a%3c Wrestlers, a work that has been highly praised, and in which %0a%3c the fingers hare all the appearance of being impressed upon %0a%3c real flesh rather than upon marble. At Eome there are by %0a%3c him, a Latona, in the Temple of the Palatium ; a Venus, in the %0a%3c buildings that are memorials of Asinius Pollio ; and an^scu- %0a%3c lapius, and a Diana, in the Temple of Juno situate within %0a%3c the Porticos of Octavia. %0a%3c %0a%3c Scopas 60 rivals these artists in fame : there are by him, a %0a%3c Venus 61 and a Pothos, 52 statues which are venerated at Samo- %0a%3c thrace with the most august ceremonials. He was also the %0a%3c sculptor of the Palatine Apollo ; a Vesta seated, in the Gardens %0a%3c of Servilius, and represented with two Bends* 3 around her, a %0a%3c work that has been highly praised ; two similar Bends, to be %0a%3c seen upon the buildings of Asinius Pollio ; and some figures of %0a%3c Canephori 61 in the same place. But the most highly esteemed %0a%3c of all his works, are those in the Temple erected by Cneius %0a%3c Domitius, 55 in the Plaminian Circus; a figure of Neptune %0a%3c himself, a Thetis and Achilles, Nereids seated upon dolphins, %0a%3c cetaceous fishes, and 56 sea-horses, 57 Tritons, the train of Phor- %0a%3c %0a%3c most bitter servitude, as " hewers of wood and drawers of water."

This, which is probably the true reading, has been %0a%3c restored by Sillig from the Bamberg MS. The KafinTtjp was the bend or %0a%3c turning, round the goal in the race-course for chariots ; and as Vesta was %0a%3c symbolical of the earth, these figures, Sillig thinks, probably represented %0a%3c tiie poles, as goals of the sun's course. %0a%3c %0a%3c 64 Figures of Virgins, carrying on their heads baskets filled with ob- %0a%3c jects consecrated to Minerva. %0a%3c %0a%3c « Dedicated to Neptune by Cneius Domitius Ahenobarbus, in the Ninth %0a%3c Legion of the City. %0a%3c %0a%3c 56 "Et" appears a preferable reading to the "aut" of the Bamberg MS. %0a%3c %0a%3c 51 " Hippocampi."

In addition to the works %0a%3c by him already mentioned, and others of the existence of %0a%3c which we are ignorant, there is still to be seen a colossal Mara %0a%3c of his, seated, in the Temple erected by Brutus Callaecus, 60 %0a%3c also in the Flaminian Circus ; as also, a naked Venus, of an- %0a%3c terior date to that by Praxiteles, and a production that would %0a%3c be quite sufficient to establish the renown of any other place. %0a%3c %0a%3c At Rome, it is true, it is quite lost sight of amid such a vast %0a%3c multitude of similar works of art : and then besides, the inat- %0a%3c tention to these matters that is induced by such vast numbers %0a%3c of duties and so many items of business, quite precludes the %0a%3c generality of persons from devoting their thoughts to the %0a%3c subject. For, in fact, the admiration that is due to this art, %0a%3c not only demands an abundance of leisure, but requires that %0a%3c profound silence should reign upon the spot. Hence it is, %0a%3c that the artist is now forgotten, who executed the statue of %0a%3c Venus that was dedicated by the Emperor Vespasianus in his %0a%3c Temple of Peace, a work well worthy of the high repute of %0a%3c ancient times. With reference, too, to the Dying Children of %0a%3c Niobe, in the Temple of the Sosian 61 Apollo, there is an equal %0a%3c degree of uncertainty, whether it is the work 62 of Scopas or of %0a%3c Praxiteles. So, too, as to the Father Janus, a work that was %0a%3c brought from Egypt and dedicated in his Temple 63 by Augus- %0a%3c tus, it is a question by which of these two artists 61 it was made : %0a%3c at the present day, however, it is quite hidden from us by the %0a%3c %0a%3c the small fish so called in B. xxxii. cc. 20, 23. 27, 30, 35, 38, 50, and 53, %0a%3c and alluded to in B. ix. c. 1 ; the Syngnathus hippocampus of Linnaeus. %0a%3c 58 A sea-divinity. ^ "Pistrices."

The same question, too, %0a%3c arises with reference to the Cupid brandishing a Thunderbolt, %0a%3c now to be seen in the Curia of Octavia: the only thin- is %0a%3c fact, that is affirmed with any degree of certainty respecting %0a%3c it, is, that it is a likeness of Alcibiades, who was the hand- %0a%3c somest man of his day. There are, too, in the Schools 65 of %0a%3c Octavia, many other highly attractive works, the authors of %0a%3c which are now unknown : four Satyrs, for example, one of %0a%3c which carries in his arms a Father Liber, robed in the palla; 68 %0a%3c another similarly supports the Goddess Libera; 67 a third is %0a%3c pacifying a child who is crying ; and a fourth is giving a child %0a%3c some water to drink, from a cup ; two Zephyrs also, who %0a%3c agitate their flowing drapery with their breath. No less is %0a%3c the uncertainty that prevails as to the authors of the statues %0a%3c now to be seen in the Septa; 68 an Olympus 69 and Pan, and a %0a%3c Charon and Achilles; 70 and yet their high reputation has %0a%3c caused them to be deemed valuable enough for their keepers %0a%3c to be made answerable for their safety at the cost of their lives. %0a%3c %0a%3c Scopas had for rivals and contemporaries, Bryaxis, 71 Timo- %0a%3c theus," and Leochares, 73 artists whom we are bound to men- %0a%3c tion together, from the fact that they worked together at the %0a%3c Mausoleum ; such being the name of the tomb that was %0a%3c erected by his wife Artemisia in honour of Mausolus, a petty %0a%3c king of Caria, who died in the second year of the hundred and %0a%3c seventh Olympiad. It was through the exertions of these %0a%3c artists more particularly, that this work came to be reckoned %0a%3c one of the Seven Wonders of the "World. 71 The circumfer- %0a%3c ence 75 of this building is, in all, four hundred and forty feet, %0a%3c %0a%3c 65 See B. xxxv. c. 37. %0a%3c %0a%3c 66 A large upper garment, reaching to the ankles. %0a%3c %0a%3c 67 Both Liber and Libera were originally Italian Divinities, who pre- %0a%3c sided over the vine and the fields.

A fifth artist also took part in the %0a%3c work ; for above the Pteron there is a pyramid erected, equal %0a%3c in height to the building below, and formed of four and %0a%3c twenty steps, which gradually taper upwards towards the %0a%3c summit; a platform, crowned with a representation of a four- %0a%3c horse chariot by Pythis. This addition makes the total height %0a%3c of the work one hundred and forty feet. 80 %0a%3c %0a%3c There is at Rome, by Timotheus, a Diana, in the Temple of %0a%3c Apollo in the Palatium, the head of which has been replaced %0a%3c by Avianius Evander. 81 A- Hercules, too, by Menestratus, 8 - is %0a%3c greatly admired ; and there is a Hecate of his at Ephesus, in %0a%3c %0a%3c 76 Facing east and west. %0a%3c %0a%3c 77 Or " wing." The " ptera," or " pteromata," properly speaking, were %0a%3c the two wings at the sides of a building. See Note 80 below. %0a%3c %0a%3c 78 She only survived her husband two years. %0a%3c %0a%3c 80 Another reading, and perhaps a preferable one, is " one hundred" feet. %0a%3c The account given by Pliny is very confused, and Littre has taken some %0a%3c pains to explain the construction of this building. He is of opinion that %0a%3c in the first place, a quadrangular main building was erected, 63 feet in %0a%3c length on the north and south, the breadth of the east and west faces %0a%3c being shorter, some 42 feet perhaps. Secondly, that there was a screen of %0a%3c 36 columns surrounding the main building, and 411 feet in circumference. %0a%3c (He adopts this reading in preference to the 440 feet of the Bamb&rg MS.) %0a%3c That the longer sides of this screen were 113.25 feet in extent, and the %0a%3c shorter 92.125 feet. That between the main building and this screen, or %0a%3c colonnade, there was an interval of 25.125 feet. Thirdly, that the colon- %0a%3c nade and the main buildings were united by a vaulted roof, and that this %0a%3c union formed the " Pteron." Fourthly, that rising from this Pteron, %0a%3c there was a quadrangular truncated pyramid, formed of twenty-four steps, %0a%3c and surmounted with a chariot of marble. This would allow, speaking in %0a%3c round numbers, 37£ feet for the height of the main body of the building, %0a%3c 87j feet for the pyramid, and twenty-five feet for the height of the chariot %0a%3c aud the figure which it doubtless contained. %0a%3c %0a%3c 81 Supposed to be the person alluded to by Horace, 1 Sat. 3, 90. %0a%3c %0a%3c 82 He is mentioned also by Tatian, and is supposed to have lived about %0a%3c the tiiue of Alexander the Great. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 318 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c TLINY'S NATURAL HISTORY.

As to %0a%3c Myron, 86 who is so highly praised for his works in bronze, %0a%3c there is by him at Smyrna, An Old Woman Intoxicated, a %0a%3c work that is held in high estimation. %0a%3c %0a%3c Asinius Pollio, a man of a warm and ardent temperament, %0a%3c was determined that the buildings which he erected as memo- %0a%3c rials of himself should be made as attractive as possible ; for %0a%3c here we see groups representing, Nymphs carried off by Centaurs, %0a%3c a work of Arcesilas : 87 the Thespiades, 88 by Cleomenes : 89 Oceanus %0a%3c and Jupiter, by Heniochus : 90 the Appiades, 91 by Stephanus : 92 %0a%3c Hermerotes, 93 by Tauriscus, not the chaser in silver, already 91 %0a%3c mentioned, but a native of Tralles : 95 a Jupiter Hospitalis 96 by Pa- %0a%3c pylus, a pupil of Praxiteles : Zethus and Amphion, with Birce, %0a%3c the Bull, 97 and the halter, all sculptured from a single block of %0a%3c %0a%3c 85 " Charites." 84 " Porch," or " Vestibule" of the Citadel at Athens. %0a%3c %0a%3c 85 Mentioned in B. xxxv. c. 40. The present Socrates is identified by %0a%3c Pausanias, B. i. c. 22, and B. ix. c. 25, and by Diogenes Laertius, B. ii. %0a%3c c. 19, with the great Athenian philosopher of that name, son of the statuary %0a%3c Sopbroniscus : but the question as to his identity is very doubtful. Diogenes %0a%3c Laertius adds, that whereas artists had previously represented the Graces %0a%3c naked, Socrates sculptured them with drapery. %0a%3c %0a%3c 86 See B. xxxiv. c. 19. 87 See B. xxxv. c. 45. %0a%3c %0a%3c 88 Or Muses of Thespiaj, in Bceotia. %0a%3c %0a%3c 89 There have been several distinguished sculptors, all of this name. %0a%3c A statuary, son of Apollodorus the Athenian, made the celebrated Venus %0a%3c de Medici. It is the opinion of Visconti and Thiersch, that the artist here %0a%3c mentioned flourished before the destruction of Corinth. %0a%3c %0a%3c 90 This name is doubtful, and nothing is known relative to the artist. %0a%3c %0a%3c 91 " Hippiades" is the old reading, which Dalechamps considers to %0a%3c mean " Amazons." The Appiades were Nymphs of the Appian Spring, %0a%3c near the temple of Venus Genetrix, in the Forum of Julius Ctesar. See %0a%3c Ovid, Art. Am. B. L 1. 81, and B. in. 1. 451 ; and Rem.

These two artists made it a sort of rivalry %0a%3c as to their parentage, for they declared that, although Apollodor us %0a%3c was their natural progenitor, Menecrates 98 would appear to have %0a%3c been their father. In the same place, too, there is a Father %0a%3c Liber," by Eutychides, 1 highly praised. Near the Portico of Oc- %0a%3c tavia, there is an Apollo, by Philiscus 2 of Rhodes, placed in the %0a%3c Temple of that God ; a Latona and Diana also ; the Nine Muses ; %0a%3c and another Apollo, without drapery. The Apollo holding the %0a%3c Lyre, in the same temple, was executed by Timarchides. 3 In %0a%3c the Temple of Juno, within the Porticos of Octavia, there is %0a%3c a figure of that goddess, executed by Dionysius, 4 and another %0a%3c by Polycles, 5 as also other statues by Praxiteles. 6 This Poly- %0a%3c cles, too, in conjunction with Dionysius, 7 the son of Timar- %0a%3c chides, made the statue of Jupiter, which is to be seen in the %0a%3c adjoining temple. 8 The figures of Pan and Olympus Wrestling, %0a%3c in the same place, are by Heliodorus ; 9 and they are considered %0a%3c to be the next finest group 10 of this nature in all the world. The %0a%3c same artist also executed a Yenus at the Bath, and Polychar- %0a%3c mus another Venus, in an erect 11 posture. %0a%3c %0a%3c By the honourable place which the work of Lysias occupies, %0a%3c we may see in what high esteem it was held by the late Em- %0a%3c peror Augustus, who consecrated it in honour of his father %0a%3c Octavius, in the Palatium, placing it on an arch within a small %0a%3c %0a%3c Thebes, to the flanks of an infuriated bull, in revenge for the death of %0a%3c their mother, Antiope, who had been similarly slain by her. This group %0a%3c is supposed still to exist, in part, in the " Farnese Bull," which has been %0a%3c in a great measure restored. Winckelmann is of opinion, however, that %0a%3c the Farnese Bull is of anterior date to that here mentioned, and that it %0a%3c belongs to the school of Lysippus. %0a%3c %0a%3c 98 Probably a native of Rhodes.

I find it stated, also, that the Apollo by Calamis, the %0a%3c chaser already 12 mentioned, the Pugilists by Dercylides, and %0a%3c the statue of Callisthenes the historian, by Amphistratus, 13 all %0a%3c of them now in the Gardens of Servilius, are works highly %0a%3c esteemed. %0a%3c %0a%3c Beyond these, there are not many sculptors of high re- %0a%3c pute ; for, in the case of seVeral works of very great excellence, %0a%3c the number of artists that have been engaged upon them has %0a%3c proved a considerable obstacle to the fame of each, no individual %0a%3c being able to engross the whole of the credit, and it being %0a%3c impossible to award it in due proportion to the names of the %0a%3c several artists combined. Such is the case with the Laocoon, %0a%3c for example, in the palace of the Emperor Titus, a work that %0a%3c may be looked upon as preferable to any other production of %0a%3c the art of painting or of statuary. It is sculptured from a single %0a%3c block, both the main figure as well as the children, and the ser- %0a%3c pents with their marvellous folds. This group was made in con- %0a%3c cert by three most eminent artists, 11 Agesander, Polydorus, and %0a%3c Athenodorus, natives of llhodes. In similar manner also, the %0a%3c palaces of the Caesars, in the Palatium, have been filled with %0a%3c most splendid statuary, the work of Craterus, in conjunction %0a%3c %0a%3c 12 In B. xxxiii. c. 55, and B. xxxiv. c. 18. %0a%3c %0a%3c 13 A sculptor of the age of Alexander the Great. He is also mentioned %0a%3c by Tatian. For an account of Callisthenes, see end of B. xii. %0a%3c %0a%3c 11 Winckelinann supposes that these artists lived in the time of Ly- %0a%3c sippus ; but, as may be discovered from an attentive examination of the %0a%3c present passage, Lessing and Thiersch are probably right in considering %0a%3c them to have been contemporaries of the Emperor Titus. This group is %0a%3c generally supposed to have been identical with the Laocoon still to be seen %0a%3c in the Court of the Belvedere, in the Vatican at Rome ; having been %0a%3c found, in 1506, in a vault beneath the spot known as the Place de Selte %0a%3c Sale, by Felix de Fredi, who surrendered it, in consideration of a pension, %0a%3c to Pope Julius II. The group, however, is not made of a single block, %0a%3c which has caused some to doubt its identity : but it is not improbable, that %0a%3c when originally made, its joints were not perceptible to a common ob- %0a%3c server. The spot, too, where it was found was actually part of the palace %0a%3c of Titus. It is most probable that the artists had the beautiful episode %0a%3c of Laocoon in view, as penned by Virgil, JEn. B. II. ; though Ajasson %0a%3c doubts whether they derived any inspiration from it. Laocoon, in the %0a%3c sublime expression of his countenance, is doing any thing, he says, but — %0a%3c %0a%3c " Clamores simul horrendos ad sidera tollit." %0a%3c %0a%3c u Sending dire outcries to the stars of heaven." %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 4.] A11TI3TS WHO EXCELLED IN SCULPTTTEE. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 321 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c with Pythodorus, of Polydeuces with Hermolaus, and of another %0a%3c Pythodorus with Artemon ; some of the statues, also, are by %0a%3c Aphrodisius of Tralles, who worked alone. The Pantheon of %0a%3c Agrippa has been decorated by Diogenes of Athens, and the %0a%3c Caryatides, by him, which form the columns of that temple, are %0a%3c looked upon as master-pieces of excellence : the same, too, %0a%3c with the statues that are placed upon the roof, though, in %0a%3c consequence of the height, they have not had an opportunity %0a%3c of being so well appreciated. %0a%3c %0a%3c Without glory, and excluded from every temple, is the %0a%3c statue of Hercules, 15 in honour of whom the Carthaginians %0a%3c were accustomed to sacrifice human victims every year : it %0a%3c stands upon the ground before the entrance of the Portico of %0a%3c the Nations. 16 There were erected, too, near the Temple of %0a%3c Felicity, the statues of the Thespian 17 Muses ; of one of which, %0a%3c according to Varro, Junius Pisciculus, a Roman of equestrian %0a%3c rank, became enamoured. Pasi teles, 18 too, speaks in terms of %0a%3c high admiration of them, the artist who wrote five Books on %0a%3c the most celebrated works throughout the world. Born upon %0a%3c the Grecian 19 shores of Italy, and presented with the Roman %0a%3c citizenship granted to the cities of those parts, Pasiteles con- %0a%3c structed the ivory statue of Jupiter which is now in the Temple %0a%3c of Metellus, 20 on the road to the Campus Martius. It so hap- %0a%3c pened, that being one day at the Docks, 21 where there were %0a%3c some wild beasts from Africa, while he was viewing through %0a%3c the bars of a cage a lion which he was engaged in drawing, a %0a%3c panther made its escape from another cage, to the no small %0a%3c danger of this most careful artist. He executed many other %0a%3c works, it is said, but we do not find the names of them speci- %0a%3c fically mentioned. %0a%3c %0a%3c 15 This was an ancient and hideous idol, probably. Plato, Diodorus %0a%3c Siculus, Flautus, Lactantius, Arnobius, and Isidorus, all concur in saying %0a%3c that it was Saturn in honour of whom human victims were immolated. %0a%3c %0a%3c 16 " Ad Nationes."

Some are of opinion that these artists were %0a%3c very wealthy men, and that they erected these buildings at %0a%3c their own expense, expecting to be allowed to inscribe their %0a%3c names thereon ; but that, this indulgence being refused them, %0a%3c they adopted another method of attaining their object. At %0a%3c all events, there are still to be seen, at the present day, on the %0a%3c spirals 27 of the columns, the figures of a lizard and a frog, 28 %0a%3c emblematical of their names. In the Temple of Jupiter by %0a%3c the same artists, the paintings, as well as all the other orna- %0a%3c ments, bear reference to the worship of a goddess. The 29 fact %0a%3c is, that when the temple of Juno was completed, the porters, as %0a%3c it is said, who were entrusted with the carriage of the statues, %0a%3c made an exchange of them ; and, on religious grounds, the %0a%3c mistake was left uncorrected, from an impression that it had %0a%3c been by the intervention of the divinities themselves, that %0a%3c this seat of worship had been thus shared between them. %0a%3c Hence it is that we see in the Temple of Juno, also, the orna- %0a%3c ments which properly pertain to the worship of Jupiter. %0a%3c %0a%3c 22 See B. xxxv. c. 45. %0a%3c %0a%3c 23 In the Ninth Region of the City.

(6.) AT WHAT PERIOD MARBLE WAS FIRST USED IN %0a%3c %0a%3c BUILDINGS. %0a%3c %0a%3c This must suffice for the sculptors in marble, and the works %0a%3c that have gained the highest repute ; with reference to which %0a%3c subject it occurs to me to remark, that spotted marbles were not %0a%3c then in fashion. In making their statues, these artists used the %0a%3c marble of Thasos also, 32 one of the Cyclades, and of Lesbos, this %0a%3c last being rather more livid than the other. The poet Menander, %0a%3c in fact, who was a very careful enquirer into all matters of %0a%3c luxury, is the first who has spoken, and that but rarely, of va- %0a%3c riegated marbles, and, indeed, of the employment of marble in %0a%3c general. Columns of this material were at first employed in %0a%3c temples, not on grounds of superior elegance, (for that was not %0a%3c thought of, as yet), but because no material could be found of %0a%3c a more substantial nature. It was under these circumstances, %0a%3c that the Temple 33 of the Olympian Jupiter was commenced at %0a%3c Athens, the columns of which were brought by Sylla to Rome, %0a%3c for the buildings in the Capitol. %0a%3c %0a%3c Still, however, there had been a distinction drawn between %0a%3c ordinary stone and marble, in the days of Homer even. The %0a%3c poet speaks in one passage of a person 34 being struck down %0a%3c with a huge mass of marble ; but that is all ; and when he %0a%3c describes the abodes of royalty adorned with every elegance, %0a%3c besides brass, gold, electrum, 35 and silver, he only mentions %0a%3c ivory. Variegated marbles, in my opinion, were first dis- %0a%3c covered in the quarries of Chios, when the inhabitants were %0a%3c building the walls of their city ; a circumstance which gave %0a%3c rise to a facetious repartee on the part of M. Cicero. It being %0a%3c the practice with them to show these walls to everybody, as %0a%3c %0a%3c 30 A sculptor of Miletus. See B. vii. c. 21. %0a%3c %0a%3c 31 A Lacedaemonian artist.

The most ancient instance of this practice, so far as I %0a%3c know of, is found in the palace of Mausolus, at Halicarnassus, %0a%3c the walls of which, in brick, are covered with marble of Pro- %0a%3c connesus. Mausolus died in the second year of the hundred %0a%3c and seventh 39 Olympiad, being the year of Rome, 403. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 7. — WHO WAS THE FIRST TO ENCRUST THE WALLS OF HOCSES %0a%3c AT ROME WITH MARBLE. %0a%3c %0a%3c The first person at Rome who covered the whole of the walls %0a%3c of his house with marble, according to Cornelius Nepos, 40 was %0a%3c Mamurra, 41 who dwelt upon the Cselian Hill, a member of the %0a%3c equestrian order, and a native of Formise, who had been pre- %0a%3c fect of the engineers under C. Caesar in Gaul. Such was the %0a%3c individual, that nothing may be wanting to the indignity %0a%3c of the example, who first adopted this practice ; the same %0a%3c Mamurra, in fact, who has been so torn to pieces in the verses %0a%3c of Catullus of Verona. Indeed, his own house proclaimed %0a%3c more loudly than Catullus could proclaim it, that he had come %0a%3c into possession of all that Gallia Comata had had to possess. %0a%3c %0a%3c 36 This is generally explained as meaning ordinary stone, but covered %0a%3c with elaborate paintings, as was then the practice in the magnificent villas %0a%3c that were built at Tibur, the modem Tivoli. See, however, Chapter 48, %0a%3c and Note 36. %0a%3c %0a%3c 31 As applied to the decorations of the walls of bouses. %0a%3c %0a%3c 39 This date does not agree with that given to Scopas, one of the artists %0a%3c who worked at the Mausoleum, in the early part of B. xxxiv. c. 19. Sillig, %0a%3c however, is inclined to think that there were two artists named Scopas, %0a%3c and would thus account for the diversity of about seventv years between %0a%3c the dates. 40 See end of B. ii. %0a%3c %0a%3c « Owing to the liberality of Caesar, he amassed great riches. He is %0a%3c repeatedly attacked by Catullus (Carm. xxix., xliii., Mi.), and accused of %0a%3c extortion, and other vices. Horace also speaks of him in terms of ridicule, %0a%3c I Sat. 5, 37. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 9.J METHOD OF CUTTING MABBLE INTO SLABS. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 325 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c For Nepos adds, as well, that lie was the first to have all the %0a%3c columns of his house made of nothing but solid marble, and %0a%3c that, too, marble of Carystus 42 or of Luna. 43 %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 8. AT WHAT TEBIOD THE VABIOUS KINDS OF MABBLE CAME %0a%3c %0a%3c INTO USE AT BOME. %0a%3c %0a%3c M. Lepidus, who was consul with Q. Catulus, was the %0a%3c first to have the lintels of his house made of Numidian marble, %0a%3c a thing for which he was greatly censured : he was consul m %0a%3c the year of Rome, 676. This is the earliest instance that I %0a%3c can find of the introduction of Numidian marble ; not in the %0a%3c form of pillars, however, or of slabs, as was the case with the %0a%3c marble of Carystus, above-mentioned, but in blocks, and that %0a%3c too, for the comparatively ignoble purpose of making the %0a%3c thresholds of doors. Four years after this Lepidus, L. Lucul- %0a%3c lus was consul ; the same person who gave its name, it is %0a%3c very evident, to the Lucullan marble ; for, taking a great fancy %0a%3c to it, he introduced it at Rome. While other kinds of marble %0a%3c are valued for their spots or their colours, this marble is en- %0a%3c tirely black. 46 It is found in the island of Melos, 46 and is %0a%3c pretty nearly the only marble that has taken its name from %0a%3c the person who first introduced it. Among these personages, %0a%3c Scaurus, in my opinion, was the first to build a theatre with %0a%3c walls of marble : but whether they were only coated with %0a%3c slabs of marble or were made of solid blocks highly polished, %0a%3c such as we now see in the Temple of Jupiter Tonans, 47 in the %0a%3c Capitol, I cannot exactly say : for, up to this period, I cannot %0a%3c find any vestiges of the use of marble slabs in Italy. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 9. THE METHOD OF CUTTING MABBLE INTO SLABS. THE %0a%3c %0a%3c SAND USED IN CUTTING MAliBLE. %0a%3c %0a%3c But whoever it was that first invented the art of thus cutting %0a%3c marble, and so multiplying the appliances of luxury, he dis- %0a%3c played considerable ingenuity, though to little purpose. This %0a%3c %0a%3c 42 See B. iv. c. 21. 43 See Chapter 4 of this Book. %0a%3c %0a%3c 45 The black marbles, Ajasson remarks, are comparatively rare. He is %0a%3c of opinion that the colour of the Lucullan marble was the noir antique of %0a%3c the French, and says that it is to be found at Bergamo, Carrara, Prato in %0a%3c Tuscany, and near Spa in Belgium. %0a%3c %0a%3c 46 "Chios" is another reading. %0a%3c %0a%3c 47 "Thundering Jupiter."

Still, however, for polishing marble, %0a%3c we find it recommended 19 to rub it with Indian sand calcined. %0a%3c The sand of Naxos has the same defect ; as also that from %0a%3c Coptos, generally known as " Egyptian" sand. %0a%3c %0a%3c The above were the several varieties of sand used by the %0a%3c ancients in dividing marble. More recently, a sand has been %0a%3c discovered that is equally approved of for this purpose ; in a %0a%3c certain creek of the Adriatic Sea, which is left dry at low %0a%3c water only ; a thing that renders it not very easy to be found. %0a%3c At the present day, however, the fraudulent tendencies of our %0a%3c workers in marble have emboldened them to use any kind of %0a%3c river-sand for the purpose ; a mischief which very few em- %0a%3c ployers rightly appreciate. For, the coarser the sand, the %0a%3c wider is the division made in the stone, the greater the quan- %0a%3c tity of material consumed, and the more extensive the labour %0a%3c required for polishing the rough surface that is left ; a result %0a%3c of which is that the slabs lose so much more in thickness. %0a%3c For giving the last polish to marble, 50 Thebaic stone 51 is con- %0a%3c sidered well adapted, as also porous stone, or pumice, powdered %0a%3c fine. %0a%3c %0a%3c 49 Ajasson says that his remarks on the choice of the sand for this pur- %0a%3c pose, are very judicious. %0a%3c %0a%3c 49 A recommendation worse than useless, Ajasson remarks. %0a%3c %0a%3c 50 For this purpose, at the present day. granular corindon, or yellow %0a%3c emery, is used, as also a mixture composed of the oxides of lead 'and of %0a%3c tin ; the suhstance heing repeatedly moistened when applied. %0a%3c %0a%3c 31 See Chapters 13 and 43 of this Look. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chop. 11.] THE MARBLKS OF ALEXANDRIA. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 327 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 10. (7.) STONE OF NAXOS. STONE OF ARMENIA. %0a%3c %0a%3c For polishing marble statues, as also for cutting and giving %0a%3c a polish to precious stones, the preference was long given to %0a%3c the stone of Naxos, 52 such being the name of a kind of touch- %0a%3c stone 53 that is found in the Isle of Cyprus. More recently, %0a%3c however, the stones imported from Armenia for this purpose %0a%3c have displaced those of Naxos. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP 11. THE MARBLES OF ALEXANDRIA. %0a%3c %0a%3c The marbles are too well known to make it necessary for %0a%3c me to enumerate their several colours and varieties ; and, %0a%3c indeed, so numerous are they, that it would be no easy task to %0a%3c do so. For what place is there, in fact, that has not a marble %0a%3c of its own ? In addition to which, in our description of the %0a%3c earth and its various peoples, 64 we have already made it our %0a%3c care to mention the more celebrated kinds of marble. Still, %0a%3c however, they are not all of them produced from quarries, but %0a%3c in many instances lie scattered just beneath the surface of the %0a%3c earth ; some of them the most precious even, the green Lace- %0a%3c daemonian marble, for example, more brilliant in colour than %0a%3c any other; the Augustan also; and, more recently, the Tiberian ; %0a%3c which were first discovered, in the reigns respectively of %0a%3c Augustus and Tiberius, in Egypt. These two marbles differ %0a%3c from ophites 55 in the circumstance that the latter is marked %0a%3c with streaks which resemble serpents 56 in appearance, whence %0a%3c its name. There is also this difference between the two %0a%3c marbles themselves, in the arrangement of their spots : the %0a%3c Augustan marble has them undulated and curling to a point; %0a%3c whereas in the Tiberian the streaks are white, 57 not involved, %0a%3c but lying wide asunder. %0a%3c %0a%3c Of ophites, there are only some very small pillars known to %0a%3c have been made. There are two varieties of it, one white %0a%3c and soft, the other inclining to black, and hard. Both kinds, %0a%3c it is said, worn as an amulet, are a cure for head-ache, and for %0a%3c %0a%3c 62 A city in Crete where the stone was prepared for use. 53 " Cotes." %0a%3c 54 Books III. IV.

As a %0a%3c counter-poison to serpents, some persons speak more particu- %0a%3c larly in praise of the ophites that is known as " tephrias,"" %0a%3c from its ashy colour. There is also a marble known as %0a%3c "memphites," from the place 60 where it is found, and of a %0a%3c nature somewhat analogous to the precious stones. For medi- %0a%3c cinal purposes, it is triturated and applied in the form of a %0a%3c liniment, with vinegar, to such parts of the body as require %0a%3c cauterizing or incision ; the flesh becoming quite benumbed, %0a%3c and thereby rendered insensible to pain. %0a%3c %0a%3c Porphyrites, 61 which is another production of Egypt, is of a %0a%3c red colour : the kind that is mottled with white blotches is %0a%3c known as " leptospsephos." 62 The quarries there are able to %0a%3c furnish blocks 63 of any dimensions, however large. Vitrasius %0a%3c Pollio, who was steward 64 in Egypt for the Emperor Claudius, %0a%3c brought to Rome from Egypt some statues made of this stone ; %0a%3c a novelty which was not very highly approved of, as no one %0a%3c has since followed his example. The Egyptians, too, have %0a%3c discovered in ^Ethiopia the stone known as " basanites ;" 65 %0a%3c which in colour and hardness resembles iron, whence the %0a%3c name 66 that has been given to it. A larger block of it has %0a%3c never been known than the one forming the group which has %0a%3c been dedicated by the Emperor Vespasianus Augustus in the %0a%3c Temple of Peace. It represents the river Nilus with sixteen %0a%3c children sporting around it, 67 symbolical of the sixteen cubits, %0a%3c the extreme height 68 to which, in the most favourable seasons, %0a%3c that river should rise. It is stated, too, that in the Temple %0a%3c of Serapis at Thebes, there is a block not unlike it, which %0a%3c forms the statue of Memnon 69 there ; remarkable, it is said, for %0a%3c %0a%3c 58 A superstition, owing solely to the name and appearance of the stone. %0a%3c %0a%3c 59 From the Greek Ttfpa, " ashes."

ONYX AND ALABASTRITES ; SIX REMEDIES. %0a%3c %0a%3c Our forefathers imagined that onyx 70 was only to be %0a%3c found iu the mountains of Arabia, and nowhere else ; but %0a%3c Sudines 71 was aware that it is also found in Carmania. 72 %0a%3c Drinking- vessels were made of it at first, and then the feet of %0a%3c beds and chairs. Cornelius Nepos relates that great was the %0a%3c astonishment, when P. Lentulus Spinther exhibited amphorae %0a%3c made of this material, as large as Chian wine-vessels in %0a%3c size ; " and yet, five years after," says he, "I saw columns of %0a%3c this material, no less than two-and-thirty feet in height." At %0a%3c a more recent period again, some change took place 73 with %0a%3c reference to this stone ; for four 74 small pillars of it were %0a%3c erected by Cornelius Balbus in his Theatre 75 as something %0a%3c quite marvellous : and I myself have seen thirty columns, of %0a%3c larger size, in the banquetting-room which Callistus 76 erected, %0a%3c the freedman of Claudius, so well known for the influence %0a%3c which he possessed. %0a%3c %0a%3c (8.) This 76 * stone is called " alabastrites" 17 by some, and is %0a%3c hollowed out into vessels for holding unguents, it having the %0a%3c reputation of preserving them from corruption 18 better than %0a%3c anything else. In a calcined state, it is a good ingredient for %0a%3c %0a%3c posed that it represented a monarch of the second dynasty. This is pro- %0a%3c bably the statue still to be seen at Medinet Abou, on the Libyan side of %0a%3c the Nile, in a sitting posture, and at least 60 feet in height. The legs, %0a%3c arms, and other parts of the body are covered with inscriptions, which ' %0a%3c attest that, in the third century of the Christian era, the priests still prac- %0a%3c tised upon the credulity of the devotees, by pretending that it emitted %0a%3c sounds. It may possibly have been erected for astronomical purposes, or %0a%3c for the mystic worship of the sun. The Greek name " Memnon" is sup- %0a%3c posed to have been derived from the Egyptian Mei Amun, "beloved of %0a%3c Amnion." %0a%3c %0a%3c 70 Ajasson remarks that under this name the ancients meant, first, yellow %0a%3c calcareous Alabaster, and secondly, Chalcedony, unclassified. %0a%3c %0a%3c 71 See end of the present Book. 72 See B. vi. cc. 27, 23, 32. %0a%3c %0a%3c 73 ii Variatum est." %0a%3c %0a%3c 74 Ajasson thinks that these columns, in reality, were made, in both %0a%3c instances, of yellow jasper, or else yellow sardonyx, a compound of sard %0a%3c and chalcedony. 75 Erected a.u.c. 741. 76 See B. xxxiii. c. 47. %0a%3c %0a%3c 76> The reading here is doubtful, and it is questionable whether he con- %0a%3c siders the two stones as identical. %0a%3c ~>i Probably calcareous Alabaster, Ajasson thinks.

LYGDINTJS; CORALLITIC STONE; STONE OF ALABANDA; %0a%3c %0a%3c STONE OF TUKBAIS ; STONE OF STEiS E. %0a%3c %0a%3c Little inferior to it for the preservation of unguents, in the %0a%3c opinion of many, is the stone, called " lygdinus," 81 that is %0a%3c found in Paros," and never of a larger size than to admit of a %0a%3c dish or goblet being made of it. In former times, it was only %0a%3c imported from Arabia, being remarkable for its extreme %0a%3c whiteness. %0a%3c %0a%3c Great value is placed also upon two other kinds of stone, of %0a%3c quite a contrary nature ; corallitic 8 ' stone, found in Asia, in blocks %0a%3c not more than two cubits in thickness, and of a white some- %0a%3c what approaching that of ivory, and in some degree resembling %0a%3c it ; and Alabandic stone, which, on the other hand, is black, %0a%3c and is so called from the district 83 which produces it : though %0a%3c %0a%3c 79 Plaster of Paris is made of gypsum or alabaster, heated and ground. %0a%3c %0a%3c 80 A feature both of jasper and of sardonyx. %0a%3c %0a%3c 81 By some persons it has been considered to be the same with the " lych- %0a%3c nitis," or white marble, mentioned in Chapter 4 of this Book. Ajasson %0a%3c is of opinion that it has not been identified. %0a%3c %0a%3c 83 Ajasson is in doubt whether this stone was really a marble or agypsic %0a%3c alabaster. It received its name from the river Curalius or Coural, near %0a%3c which it was found ; and it was also known as Sangaric marble. Ajasson %0a%3c thinks that the ancient milk-white marble, still found in Italy, and known %0a%3c to the dealers in antiquities as Palombino, may have been the " corallitic" %0a%3c stone. He also mentions the fine white marble known as Grechetto. %0a%3c %0a%3c 83 See B. v. c. 29. Sulphuret of manganese is now known as Alaban- %0a%3c dine ; it is black, but becomes of a tarnished brown on exposure to the %0a%3c air. It is not improbable that this manganese was used for colouring %0a%3c glass, and that in Chapter 66 of this Book Pliny again refers to manganese %0a%3c when speaking of a kind of " magnet" or load-stone. See Beckmann, %0a%3c Hist. lnv. Vol. II. pp. 237—8, Bohn's Edition ; who thinks, that %0a%3c in the present passage Pliny is speaking of a kind of marble.

Having quitted the spot %0a%3c where the palace of Mnevis 94 stood, this monarch erected %0a%3c another obelisk, 95 one hundred and twenty cubits in height, %0a%3c but of prodigious thickness, the sides being no less than %0a%3c eleven cubits in breadth. (9.) It is said that one hundred %0a%3c and twenty thousand men were employed upon this work ; M %0a%3c and that the king, when it was on the point of being elevated, %0a%3c being apprehensive that the machinery employed might not %0a%3c prove strong enough for the weight, with the view of increas- %0a%3c ing the peril that might be entailed by due want of precaution %0a%3c on the part of the workmen, had his own son fastened to the %0a%3c summit ; in order that the safety of the prince might at the %0a%3c same time ensure the safety of the mass of stone. It was in his %0a%3c admiration of this work, that, when King Cambyses took the %0a%3c city by storm, and the conflagration had already reached the %0a%3c very foot of the obelisk, he ordered the fire to be extinguished ; %0a%3c he entertaining a respect for this stupendous erection which %0a%3c he had not entertained for the city itself. %0a%3c %0a%3c There are also two other obelisks, one of them erected by %0a%3c Zmarres, 96 and the other by Phius; 97 both of them without %0a%3c inscriptions, and forty-eight cubits in height. Ptolemteus %0a%3c Philadelphia had one erected at Alexandria, eighty cubits %0a%3c high, which had been prepared by order of King Necthebis :** %0a%3c it was without any inscription, and cost far more trouble in %0a%3c its carriage and elevation, than had been originally expended %0a%3c in quarrying it.

It was %0a%3c erected upon a basis of six square blocks, quarried from the %0a%3c same mountain, and the artist was rewarded with the sum of %0a%3c fifty talents. 1 This obelisk was placed by the king above- %0a%3c mentioned in the Arsinooeum, 2 in testimony of his affection for %0a%3c his wife and sister Arsinoe. At a later period, as it was found %0a%3c to be an inconvenience to the docks, Maximus, the then prasfect %0a%3c of Egypt, had it transferred to the Forum there, after removing %0a%3c the summit for the purpose of substituting a gilded point ; an %0a%3c intention which was ultimately abandoned. %0a%3c %0a%3c There are two other obelisks, which were in Caesar's Temple %0a%3c at Alexandria, near the harbour there, forty-two cubits in %0a%3c height, and originally hewn by order of King Mesphres. But %0a%3c the most difficult enterprise of all, was the carriage of these %0a%3c obelisks by sea to Borne, in vessels which excited the greatest %0a%3c admiration. Indeed, the late Emperor Augustus consecrated %0a%3c the one wnich brought over the first obelisk, as a lasting %0a%3c memorial of this marvellous undertaking, in the docks at %0a%3c Puteoli ; but it was destroyed by fire.

With this %0a%3c object, a stone pavement was laid, the extreme length of %0a%3c which corresponded exactly with the length of the shadow %0a%3c thrown by the obelisk at the sixth hour 10 on the day of the winter %0a%3c solstice. After this period, the shadow would go on, day by %0a%3c da}-, gradually decreasing, and then again 11 would as gradually %0a%3c increase, correspondingly with certain lines of brass that were %0a%3c inserted in the stone ; a device well deserving to be known, %0a%3c and due to the ingenuity of Facundus Novus, the mathema- %0a%3c tician.

They lie between %0a%3c the city of Memphis and what we have mentioned 23 as the %0a%3c Delta, within four miles of the river, and seven miles and %0a%3c a-half from Memphis, near a village known as Busiris, the %0a%3c people of which are in the habit of ascending them. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 17.

Others, again, %0a%3c maintain, that bridges were constructed, of bricks of clay, and %0a%3c that, when the pyramid was completed, these bricks were dis- %0a%3c tributed for erecting the houses of private individuals. For 11 %0a%3c the level of the river, they say, being so much lower, water %0a%3c could never by any possibility have been brought there by the %0a%3c medium of canals. In the interior of the largest Pyramid %0a%3c there is a well, eighty-six cubits deep, which communicates %0a%3c with the river, it is thought. The method of ascertaining the %0a%3c height of the Pyramids and all similar edifices was discovered 35 %0a%3c by Thales of Miletus ; he measuring the shadow at the hour of %0a%3c the day at which it is equal in length to the body projecting it. %0a%3c %0a%3c Such are the marvellous Pyramids ; but the crowning marvel %0a%3c of all is, that the smallest, but most admired of them — that we %0a%3c may feel no surprise at the opulence of the kings — was built by %0a%3c Ehodopis, 36 a courtesan ! This woman was once the fellow- %0a%3c slave of JEsopus the philosopher and fabulist, and the sharer %0a%3c %0a%3c is a fourth pyramid, but of such small dimensions that some of the Egyp- %0a%3c tian obelisks exceed it in height. %0a%3c %0a%3c 33 " Nitrum."

The %0a%3c cost of its erection was eight hundred talents, they say ; and, %0a%3c not to omit the magnanimity that was shown by King Ptole- %0a%3c maeus 38 on this occasion, he gave permission to the architect, %0a%3c Sostratus 39 of Cnidos, to inscribe his name upon the edifice %0a%3c itself.

[Book XXXVI. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c whom was Psammetichus. As to the purpose for which it %0a%3c was built, there are various opinions : Demoteles says that it %0a%3c was the palace of King Moteris, and Lyceas that it was the tomb %0a%3c of Moeris, while many others assert that it was a building %0a%3c consecrated to the Sun, an opinion which mostly prevails. %0a%3c %0a%3c That Daedalus took this for the model of the Labyrinth %0a%3c which he constructed in Crete, there can be no doubt ; though %0a%3c he only reproduced the hundredth part of it, that portion, %0a%3c namely, which encloses circuitous passages, windings, and %0a%3c inextricable galleries which lead to and fro. We must not, %0a%3c comparing this last to what we see delineated on our mosaic %0a%3c pavements, or to the mazes 43 formed in the fields for the %0a%3c amusement of children, suppose it to be a narrow promenade %0a%3c along which we may walk for many miles together ; but we %0a%3c must picture to ourselves a building filled with numerous %0a%3c doors, and galleries which continually mislead the visitor, %0a%3c bringing him back, after all his wanderings, to the spot from %0a%3c which he first set out. This 44 Labyrinth is the second, that of %0a%3c Egypt being the first. There is a third in the Isle of %0a%3c Lemnos, and a fourth in Italy. %0a%3c %0a%3c They are all of them covered with arched roofs of polished %0a%3c stone ; at the entrance, too, of the Egyptian Labyrinth, a thing %0a%3c that surprises me, the building is constructed of Parian marble, %0a%3c while throughout the other parts of it the columns are of %0a%3c syenites. 45 With such solidity is this huge mass constructed, %0a%3c that the lapse of ages has been totally unable to destroy it, %0a%3c seconded as it has been by the people of Heracleopolites, who %0a%3c have marvellously ravaged a work which they have always %0a%3c held in abhorrence. To detail thfe position of this work and %0a%3c the various portions of it is quite impossible, it being sub- %0a%3c %0a%3c 43 Similar, probably, to the one at Hampton Court. %0a%3c %0a%3c 41 Most modern writers, and some of the ancients, have altogether de- %0a%3c nied the existence of the Cretan Labyrinth ; but, judging from the testi- %0a%3c mony of Tournefort and Cockerell, it is most probable that it really did %0a%3c exist, and that it was a vast natural grotto or cavern, enlarged and made %0a%3c additionally intricate by human ingenuity. There are many caverns of %0a%3c this nature in Crete, and one near Gortyna, at Hagios-Deka, is replete with %0a%3c galleries and intricate windings similar to those ascribed to the Labyrinth %0a%3c of Dsedalus. %0a%3c %0a%3c 45 See Chapter 13 of this Book. He is surprised that the people of %0a%3c Egypt, a country which abounded in exquisite marbles, should have used %0a%3c that of another country in preference to their own. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 19.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c LA.BYBINTHS. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 341 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c divided into regions and prefectures, which are styled nomes, 46 %0a%3c thirty in number, with a vast palace assigned to each. In %0a%3c addition to these, it should contain temples of all the gods of %0a%3c Egypt, and forty statues of Nemesis 47 in as many sacred %0a%3c shrines ; besides numerous pyramids, forty ells 48 in height, and %0a%3c covering six arurse 49 at the base. Fatigued with wandering %0a%3c to and fro, the visitor is sure to arrive at some inextricable %0a%3c crossing or other of the galleries. And then, too, there are %0a%3c banquetting rooms situate at the summit of steep ascents; %0a%3c porticos from which we descend by flights of ninety steps ; %0a%3c columns in the interior, made of porphyrites ; M figures of gods ; %0a%3c statues of kings ; and effigies of hideous monsters. Some of %0a%3c the palaces are so peculiarly constructed, that the moment the %0a%3c doors are opened a dreadful sound like that of thunder rever- %0a%3c berates within : the greater part, too, of these edifices have to be %0a%3c traversed in total darkness. Then again, without the walls of %0a%3c the Labyrinth, there rises another mass of buildings known as %0a%3c the " Pteron ;" 51 beneath which there are passages excavated %0a%3c leading to other subterranean palaces. One person, and only %0a%3c one, has made some slight repairs to the Labyrinth ; Chsere- %0a%3c mon, 62 an eunuch of King Necthebis, who lived five hundred %0a%3c years before the time of Alexander the Great. It is asserted, %0a%3c also, that while the arched roofs of squared stone were being %0a%3c raised, he had them supported by beams of thorn 53 boiled %0a%3c in oil. %0a%3c %0a%3c As for the Cretan Labyrinth, what I have already stated %0a%3c must suffice for that. The Labyrinth of Lemnos" is simi- %0a%3c lar to it, only that it is rendered more imposing by its %0a%3c hundred and fifty columns ; the shafts of which, when in the %0a%3c stone-yard, were so nicely balanced, that a child was able to %0a%3c manage the wheel of the lathe in turning them.

But %0a%3c as the fabulousness of the story connected with it quite ex- %0a%3c ceeds all bounds, I shall employ the words given by M. Varro %0a%3c himself in his account of it : — " Porsena was buried," says he, %0a%3c " beneath the city of Clusium f in the spot where he had had %0a%3c constructed a square monument, built of squared stone. Each %0a%3c side of this monument was three hundred feet in length and %0a%3c fifty in height, and beneath the base, which was also square, %0a%3c there was an inextricable labyrinth, into which if any one %0a%3c entered without a clew of thread, he could never find his way %0a%3c out. Above this square building there stand five pyramids, %0a%3c one at each corner, and one in the middle, seventy-five feet %0a%3c broad at the base, and one hundred and fifty feet in height. %0a%3c These pyramids are so tapering in their form, that upon the %0a%3c summit of all of them united there rests a brazen globe, and %0a%3c upon that a petasus ; 58 from which there hang, suspended by %0a%3c chains, bells, which make a tinkling when agitated by the %0a%3c wind, like what was done at Dodona 69 in former times. Upon %0a%3c this globe there are four other pyramids, each one hundred %0a%3c feet in height ; and above them is a single platform, on which %0a%3c there are five more pyramids," 60 — the height of which Varro has %0a%3c evidently felt ashamed to add ; but, according to the Etruscan %0a%3c fables, it was equal to that of the rest of the building. What %0a%3c %0a%3c 55 Smilis lived, probably, 200 years before Rhoecus and Theodorus, and %0a%3c was a native of iEgina, not Lemnos. Sillig, however, is inclined to think %0a%3c that there were two artists of this name ; the elder a contemporary of %0a%3c Daedalus, and the maker of several wooden statues. %0a%3c %0a%3c 66 See B. xzxv. c. 43. « See B. iii. c. 8. %0a%3c %0a%3c 58 A round, broad-brimmed hat, such as we see represented in the sta- %0a%3c tues of Mercury. %0a%3c %0a%3c 59 Where two brazen vessels were erected on a column, adjoining to %0a%3c which was the statue of a boy with a whip ; which, when agitated by the %0a%3c wind, struck the vessels, and omens were drawn from the tinkling noise %0a%3c produced, significant of future events, it was supposed. %0a%3c %0a%3c 60 A buildiBg like this, as Niebuhr says, is absolutely impossible, and %0a%3c belongs to the " Arabian Nights."

This, too, %0a%3c is even less surprising than the fact that a river flows through %0a%3c the middle of the city.

(14.) — THE TEMPLE OF DIANA AT EFHESUS. %0a%3c %0a%3c The most wonderful monument of Graecian magnificence, %0a%3c and one that merits our genuine admiration, is the Temple of %0a%3c Diana at Ephesus, which took one hundred and twenty years %0a%3c in building, a work in which all Asia 63 joined. A marshy soil %0a%3c was selected for its site, in order that it might not suffer from %0a%3c earthquakes, or the chasms which they produce. On the %0a%3c other hand, again, that the foundations of so vast a pile might %0a%3c not have to rest upon a loose and shifting bed, layers of trodden %0a%3c charcoal were placed beneath, with fleeces 61 covered with wool %0a%3c upon the top of them. The entire length of the temple is %0a%3c four hundred and twenty-five feet, and the breadth two hun- %0a%3c dred and twenty-five. The columns are one hundred and %0a%3c twenty-seven in number, and sixty feet in height, each of %0a%3c them presented by a different king. Thirty-six of these %0a%3c columns are carved, and one of them by the hand of Scopas. 65 %0a%3c Chersiphron 66 was the architect who presided over the work. %0a%3c %0a%3c 61 Probably of Babylon, which were built on terraces raised on arches. %0a%3c %0a%3c 62 His meaning is, that it was built upon arches. 63 Asia Minor. %0a%3c %0a%3c 64 The Hotel de Ville at Brussels is said to have been built upon a %0a%3c stratum of hides. ...

Silhg, in his " Dictionary of %0a%3c Ancient Artists," suggests a reading which would make the passage to %0a%3c mean that Scopas was jointly architect with Chersiphron.

[Book XXXVI. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The great marvel in this building is, how such ponderous %0a%3c architraves 67 could possibly have been raised to so great a %0a%3c height. This, however, the architect effected by means of %0a%3c bags filled with sand, which he piled up upon an inclined %0a%3c plane until they reached beyond the capitals of the columns ; %0a%3c then, as he gradually emptied the lower bags, the architraves 68 %0a%3c insensibly settled in the places assigned them. But the %0a%3c greatest difficulty of all was found, in laying the lintel which %0a%3c he placed over the entrance-doors. It was an enormous mass %0a%3c of stone, and by no possibility could it be brought to lie level %0a%3c upon the jambs which formed its bed ; in consequence of %0a%3c which, the architect was driven to such a state of anxiety and %0a%3c desperation as to contemplate suicide. Wearied and quite %0a%3c worn out by such thoughts as these, during the night, they %0a%3c say, he beheld in a dream the goddess in honour of whom the %0a%3c temple was being erected ; who exhorted him to live on, for %0a%3c that she herself had placed the stone in its proper position. %0a%3c And such, in fact, next morning, was found to be the case, %0a%3c the stone apparently having come to the proper level by dint %0a%3c of its own weight. The other decorations of this work would %0a%3c suffice to fill many volumes, but they do not tend in any way %0a%3c to illustrate the works of Nature. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 22. (15.) — MARVELS CONNECTED WITH OTHER TEMPLES. %0a%3c %0a%3c There still exists, too, at Cyzicus, 89 a temple of polished %0a%3c stone, between all the joints of which the artist has inserted a %0a%3c thread of gold ; it being his intention to erect an ivory statue %0a%3c of Jupiter within, with Apollo in marble crowning him. The %0a%3c result is, that the interstices quite glisten with their fine, %0a%3c hair-like threads ; and the reflection of the gold, obscured as it %0a%3c is, gently falling upon the statues, besides proclaiming the %0a%3c genius of the artist, heightens their effect, and so teaches us %0a%3c to appreciate the costliness of the work. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 23. — THE FUGITIVE STONE.

In this %0a%3c city also, near the gate which is known as the " Trachia," 72 %0a%3c there are seven towers, which repeat a number of times all %0a%3c sounds that are uttered in them. This phenomenon, to which %0a%3c the name of " Echo," has been given by the Greeks, depends %0a%3c upon the peculiar conformation of localities, and is • produced %0a%3c in valleys more particularly. At Cyzicus, however, it is the %0a%3c effect of accident only ; while at Olympia, it is produced by %0a%3c artificial means, and in a very marvellous manner ; in a portico %0a%3c there, which is known as the " Heptaphonon," 74 from the cir- %0a%3c cumstance that it returns the sound of the voice seven times. %0a%3c %0a%3c At Cyzicus, also, is the Buleuterium, 74 a vast edifice, con- %0a%3c structed without a nail of iron ; the raftering being so con- %0a%3c trived as to admit of the beams being removed and replaced %0a%3c without the use of stays.

It, in- %0a%3c deed, all the buildings of our City are considered in the aggre- %0a%3c gate, and supposing them, so to say, all thrown together in one %0a%3c vast mass, the united grandeur of them would lead one to %0a%3c suppose that we were describing another world, accumulated %0a%3c in a single spot. . %0a%3c %0a%3c Not to mention among our great works, the Circus Maxi- %0a%3c mus, that was constructed by the Dictator Czesar, one stadium %0a%3c in width and three in length, and occupying, with the ad- %0a%3c jacent buildings, no less than four jugera, with room for two %0a%3c hundred and sixty thousand spectators seated ; am I not to %0a%3c include in the number of our magnificent constructions, the %0a%3c Basilica of Paulus, 76 with its admirable Phrygian columns ; the %0a%3c Forum of the late Emperor Augustus ; the Temple of Peace, %0a%3c ereeted by the Emperor Vespasianus Augustus — some of the %0a%3c finest works that the world has ever beheld — the roofing, %0a%3c too, of the Vote-Office," that was built by Agrippa ? not to %0a%3c forget that, before his time, Valerius of Ostia, the architect, %0a%3c had covered in a theatre at Rome, at the time of the public %0a%3c Games celebrated by Libo ? 78 %0a%3c %0a%3c "We behold with admiration pyramids that were built by %0a%3c kings, when the very ground alone, that was purchased by the %0a%3c Dictator Caesar, for the construction of his Forum, cost one %0a%3c hundred millions of sesterces ! If, too, an enormous expendi- %0a%3c ture has its attractions for any one whose mind is influenced %0a%3c by monetary considerations, be it known to him that the house %0a%3c in which Clodius dwelt, who was slain by Milo, was purchased %0a%3c by him at the price of fourteen million eight hundred thou- %0a%3c sand sesterces ! a thing that, for my part, I look upon as no %0a%3c less astounding than the monstrous follies that have been dis- %0a%3c played by kings.

But it was in those days, too, that %0a%3c old men still spoke in admiration of the vast proportions of %0a%3c the Agger, 79 and of the enormous foundations of the Capitol ; %0a%3c of the public sewers, too, a work more stupendous than any ; %0a%3c as mountains had to be pierced for their construction, and, %0a%3c like the hanging city 80 which we recently mentioned, navi- %0a%3c gation had to be carried on beneath Rome ; an event which %0a%3c happened in the aedileship 81 of M. Agrippa, after he had filled %0a%3c r the office of consul. %0a%3c %0a%3c For this purpose, there are seven rivers, made, by artificial Y %0a%3c channels, to flow beneath the city. Rushing onward, like so %0a%3c many impetuous torrents, they are compelled to carry off and %0a%3c sweep away all the sewerage ; and swollen as they are by the %0a%3c vast accession of the pluvial waters, they reverberate against %0a%3c the sides and bottom of their channels. Occasionally, too, %0a%3c the Tiber, overflowing, is thrown backward in its course, and %0a%3c discharges itself by these outlets : obstinate is the contest that %0a%3c ensues within between the meeting tides, but so firm and solid %0a%3c is the masonry, that it is enabled to offer an effectual resist- %0a%3c ance. Enormous as are the accumulations that are carried along %0a%3c above, the work of the channels never gives way. Houses %0a%3c falling spontaneously to ruins, or levelled with the ground %0a%3c by conflagrations, are continually battering against them ; %0a%3c the ground, too, is shaken by earthquakes every now and %0a%3c then ; and yet, built as they were in the days of Tarquinius %0a%3c Priscus, seven hundred years ago, these constructions have %0a%3c survived, all but unharmed. "We must not omit, too, to men- %0a%3c tion one remarkable circumstance, and all the more remark- %0a%3c able from the fact, that the most celebrated historians have %0a%3c omitted to mention it. |"Tarquinius Priscus having commenced %0a%3c the sewers, and set the lower classes to work upon them, the %0a%3c laboriousness and prolonged duration of the employment be- %0a%3c came equally an object of dread to them ; and the consequence %0a%3c was, that suicide was a thing of common occurrence, the %0a%3c %0a%3c 79 " Mound," or " Terrace."

For %0a%3c this evil, however, the king devised a singular remedy, and %0a%3c one that has never 81 * been resorted to either before that time or %0a%3c since : for he ordered the bodies of all who had been thus %0a%3c guilty of self-destruction, to be fastened to a cross, and left %0a%3c there as a spectacle to their fellow - citizens and a prey %0a%3c to birds and wild beasts. The result was, that that sense %0a%3c of propriety which so peculiarly attaches itself to the Eo- %0a%3c mau name, and which more than once has gained a victory %0a%3c when the battle was all but lost, came to the rescue on this %0a%3c occasion as well ; though for this once, the Romans were in %0a%3c reality its dupes, as they forgot that, though they felt shocked %0a%3c at the thoughts of such ignominy w T hile alive, they would be %0a%3c quite insensible to any such disgrace when dead. It is said %0a%3c that Tarquinius made these sewers of dimensions sufficiently %0a%3c large to admit of a waggon laden with hay passing along them./ %0a%3c %0a%3c All that we have just described, however, is but trifling %0a%3c when placed in comparison with one marvellous fact, which I %0a%3c must not omit to mention before I pass on to other subjects. %0a%3c In the consulship 82 of M. Lepidus and Q. Catulus, there was %0a%3c not at Eome, as we learn from the most trustworthy au- %0a%3c thors, a finer house than the one which belonged to Lepidus %0a%3c himself : and yet, by Hercules ! within five-and-thirty years %0a%3c from that period, the very same house did not hold the hun- %0a%3c dredth rank even in the City ! Let a person, if he will, in %0a%3c taking this fact into consideration, only calculate the vast %0a%3c masses of marble, the productions of painters, the regal trea- %0a%3c sures that must have been expended, in bringing these hundred %0a%3c mansions to vie with one that had been in its day the most sump- %0a%3c tuous and the most celebrated in all the City ; and then let %0a%3c him reflect how that, since that period, and down to the pre- %0a%3c sent time, these houses have all of them been surpassed by %0a%3c others without number. There can be no doubt that confla- %0a%3c grations are a punishment inflicted upon us for our luxury ; %0a%3c but such are our habits, that in spite of such warnings as these, %0a%3c we cannot be made to understand that there are things in exist- %0a%3c ence more perishable even than man himself. %0a%3c %0a%3c But there are still two other mansions by which all these %0a%3c edifices have been eclipsed. Twice have we seen the whole %0a%3c %0a%3c 8l * As Hardouin remarks, the story of the Milesian Virgins, as related %0a%3c by Aulus Gellius and Plutarch, is very similar. 82 a.u.c 676. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 24.] MARVELLOUS BUILDINGS AT ROME %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 349 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c City environed by the palaces of the Emperors Caius 83 and %0a%3c Nero ; that of the last, that nothing might be wanting to %0a%3c its magnificence, being coated with gold. 84 Surely such palaces %0a%3c as these must have been intended for the abode of those who %0a%3c created this mighty empire, and who left the plough or their %0a%3c native hearth to go forth to conquer nations, and to return %0a%3c laden with triumphs ! men, in fact, whose very fields even occu- %0a%3c pied less space than the audience-chambers 85 of these palaces. %0a%3c %0a%3c Indeed, one cannot but help reflecting how trifling a portion of %0a%3c these palaces was equal to the sites which the republic granted %0a%3c to its invincible generals, for the erection of their dwellings. %0a%3c The supreme honour, too, attendant upon these grants — as in %0a%3c the case of P. Valerius Publicola, the first consul with L. Bru- %0a%3c tus, for his many meritorious services ; and of his brother, %0a%3c who twice in one consulship defeated the Sabines — was the %0a%3c permission granted, by the terms of the decree, to have the %0a%3c doors of their houses opening from without, and the gates %0a%3c thrown back upon the public street. Such was the most dis- %0a%3c tinguished privilege accorded in those days to triumphal man- %0a%3c sions even ! %0a%3c %0a%3c I will not permit, however, these two Caiuses, 86 or two %0a%3c Neros, to enjoy this glory even, such as it is ; for I will prove %0a%3c that these extravagant follies of theirs have been surpassed, in %0a%3c the use that was made of his wealth by M. Scaurus, a private %0a%3c citizen. Indeed, I am by no means certain that it was not %0a%3c the sedileship of this personage that inflicted the first great %0a%3c hlow upon the public manners, and that Sylla was not guilty %0a%3c of a greater crime in giving such unlimited power to his step- %0a%3c son, 87 than in the proscription of so many thousands. During %0a%3c his sedileship, and only for the temporary purposes of a few %0a%3c days, Scaurus executed the greatest 88 work that has ever been %0a%3c %0a%3c 83 Caligula. The Palace of Caligula was situate on the Palatine Hill : %0a%3c that of Nero extended from the Palatine Hill to the Esquiline, nearly the %0a%3c whole of which was covered by it. It was left unfinished by Nero, but %0a%3c the Emperor Otho completed it. Martial, Spectac. Ep. 2, speaks in terms %0a%3c of indignation of there being now but one house in all the City ;" but, %0a%3c unfortunately, he gives utterance to it with a. view of flattering Domitian. %0a%3c %0a%3c 84 Whence its name, " Aurea," the " golden" Palace. 85 " Sellaria." %0a%3c %0a%3c 86 By this mode of expression, he probably means that they were " birds %0a%3c of a feather" — one as bad as the other. %0a%3c %0a%3c 87 His mother, Metella Cajcilia, became the wife of Sylla. %0a%3c %0a%3c 88 He forgets the Pyramids and the Labyrinth of Egypt, which he has %0a%3c so recently described. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 3.50 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c plikt's natural history. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XXXVI. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c made by the hands of man, even when intended to be of ever- %0a%3c lasting duration ; his Theatre, I mean.

The ground-storey was of %0a%3c marble, the second of glass, a species of luxury which ever %0a%3c since that time has been quite unheard of, and the highest of %0a%3c gilded wood. The lowermost columns, as previously 91 stated, %0a%3c were eight-and-thirty feet in height ; and, placed between %0a%3c these columns, as already 92 mentioned, were brazen statues, %0a%3c three thousand in number. The area 93 of this theatre afforded %0a%3c accommodation for eighty thousand spectators ; and yet the %0a%3c Theatre of Pompeius, after the City had so greatly increased, %0a%3c and the inhabitants had become so vastly more numerous, was %0a%3c considered abundantly large, with its sittings for forty thou- %0a%3c sand only. The rest of the fittings of it, what with Attalic 94 %0a%3c vestments, pictures, and the other stage -properties, 95 were of %0a%3c such enormous value that, after Scaurus had had conveyed to %0a%3c his Tusculan villa such parts thereof as were not required for %0a%3c the enjoyment of his daily luxuries, the loss was no less than %0a%3c three hundred millions of sesterces, when the villa was burnt %0a%3c by his servants in a spirit of revenge. %0a%3c %0a%3c The consideration of such prodigality as this quite distracts %0a%3c my attention, and compels me to digress from my original pur- %0a%3c pose, in order to mention a still greater instance of extrava- %0a%3c gance, in reference to wood. C. Curio, 96 who died during the %0a%3c civil wars, fighting on the side of Caesar, found, to his dismay, %0a%3c that he could not, when celebrating the funeral games in %0a%3c honour of his father, surpass the riches and magnificence of %0a%3c Scaurus — for where, in fact, was to be found such a stepsire %0a%3c as Sylla, and such a mother as Metella, that bidder at all %0a%3c auctions for the property of the proscribed ?

It is really worth our while to know what this device %0a%3c was, if only to congratulate ourselves upon the manners of the %0a%3c present day, and to reverse the ordinary mode of expression, %0a%3c and term ourselves the men of the olden time. 07 %0a%3c %0a%3c He caused to be erected, close together, two theatres of very %0a%3c large dimensions, and built of wood, each of them nicely poised, %0a%3c and turning on a pivot. Before mid-day, a spectacle of games %0a%3c was exhibited in each ; the theatres being turned back to back, %0a%3c in order that the noise of neither of them might interfere with %0a%3c what was going on in the other. Then, in the latter part of %0a%3c the day, all on a sudden, the two theatres were swung round, %0a%3c and, the corners uniting, brought face to face; the outer %0a%3c frames, 98 too, were removed, and thus an amphitheatre was %0a%3c formed, in which combats of gladiators were presented to the %0a%3c view ; men whose safety was almost less compromised than was %0a%3c that of the Koman people, in allowing itself to be thus whirled %0a%3c round from side to side. Now, in this case, which have we %0a%3c most reason to admire, the inventor or the invention ? the artist, %0a%3c or the author of the project ? him who first dared to think of %0a%3c such an enterprize, or him who ventured to undertake it ? him %0a%3c who obeyed the order, or him who gave it ? But the thing that %0a%3c surpasses all is, the frenzy that must have possessed the public, %0a%3c to take their seats in a place which must of necessity have been %0a%3c so unsubstantial and so insecure. Lo and behold ! here is a %0a%3c people that has conquered the whole earth, that has subdued %0a%3c the universe, that divides the spoils of kingdoms and of nations, %0a%3c that sends its laws to foreign lands, that shares in some degree %0a%3c the attributes of the immortal gods in common with mankind, %0a%3c suspended aloft in a machine, and showering plaudits even upon %0a%3c its own peril ! %0a%3c %0a%3c 87 And, consequently, of more strict manners, and more strict morals. %0a%3c %0a%3c 93 "Tabulis."

"When cities are swallowed up by %0a%3c un earthquake, it is looked upon by mankind as a general cala- %0a%3c mity ; and yet, here have we the whole lloman people, em- %0a%3c barked, so to say, in two ships, and sitting suspended on a %0a%3c couple of pivots ; the grand spectacle being its own struggle %0a%3c with danger, and its liability to perish at any moment that the %0a%3c overstrained machinery may give way ! And then the object, %0a%3c too, of all this — that public favour may he conciliated for the %0a%3c tribune's" harangues at a future day, and that, at the Rostra, %0a%3c he may still have the power of shaking the tribes, nicely %0a%3c balanced 1 as they are ! And really, what may he not dare %0a%3c with those who, at his persuasion, have braved such perils as %0a%3c these ? Indeed, to confess the truth, at the funeral games %0a%3c celebrated at the tomb of his father, it was no less than the %0a%3c whole Roman people that shared the dangers of the gladiatorial %0a%3c combats. When the pivots had now been sufficiently worked %0a%3c and wearied, he gave another turn to his magnificent displays. %0a%3c For, upon the last day, still preserving the form of the amphi- %0a%3c theatre, he cut the stage in two through the middle, and exhi- %0a%3c bited a spectacle of athletes ; after which, the stage being %0a%3c suddenly withdrawn on either side, he exhibited a combat, %0a%3c upon the same day, between such of the gladiators as had %0a%3c previously proved victorious. And yet, with all this, Curio %0a%3c was no king, no ruler of the destinies of a nation, nor yet a %0a%3c person remarkable for his opulence even ; seeing that he pos- %0a%3c sessed no resources of his own, beyond what he could realize %0a%3c from the discord between the leading men. 2 %0a%3c %0a%3c But let us now turn our attention to some marvels which, %0a%3c justly appreciated, may he truthfully pronounced to remain %0a%3c unsurpassed/ Q.

Agrippa, 8 %0a%3c in his aedileship, united the Marcian with the Virgin 9 Aque- %0a%3c duct, and repaired and strengthened the channels of the others. %0a%3c He also formed seven hundred wells, in addition to five hun- %0a%3c dred fountains, and one hundred and thirty reservoirs, many %0a%3c of them magnificently adorned. Upon these works, too, he %0a%3c erected three hundred statues of marble or bronze, and four %0a%3c hundred marble columns ; and all this in the space of a single %0a%3c year ! In the work 10 which he has written in commemoration %0a%3c of his aedileship, he also informs us that public games were %0a%3c celebrated for the space of fifty-nine days, and that one hun- %0a%3c dred and seventy gratuitous baths were opened. The number %0a%3c of these last at Rome, has increased to an infinite 11 extent %0a%3c since his time. %0a%3c %0a%3c The preceding aqueducts, however, have all been surpassed %0a%3c by the costly work which was more recently commenced by %0a%3c the Emperor Caius, 12 and completed by Claudius. Under these %0a%3c princes, the Curtian and Coerulean Waters, with the New %0a%3c Anio, 13 were brought from a distance of forty miles, and at so %0a%3c high a level that all the hills were supplied with water, on %0a%3c which the City is built. The sum expended on these works %0a%3c was three hundred and fifty millions of sesterces. If we only %0a%3c take into consideration the abundant supply of water to the %0a%3c public, for baths, ponds, canals, household purposes, gardens, %0a%3c %0a%3c 5 See B. iii. c. 17. It was commenced by M. Curius Dentatus, B.C. %0a%3c 273, the water being brought a distance of 43 miles.

Considerable remains of it are still to be seen. %0a%3c %0a%3c 6 The Aqua Tepula was constructed B.C. 127 ; so that it is doubtful if %0a%3c Pliny is not here in error. %0a%3c %0a%3c 7 The Aqua Marcia was brought a distance of upwards of 60 miles, %0a%3c from the vicinity of Sublaqueum, new Subiaco, and was of 6uch elevation %0a%3c that water could be supplied to the loftiest part of the Capitoline Hill. %0a%3c A considerable number of the arches are still standing. In the vicinity of %0a%3c the city it was afterwards united with the Aqua Tepula and the Aqua %0a%3c Julia; the watercourse of the last being above that of the Aqua Tepula, %0a%3c and that above the course of the Aqua Marcia.

In those %0a%3c parts where the soil was found to be terreous, it was necessary %0a%3c to pump up the water by the aid of machinery ; in other parts, %0a%3c again, the solid rock had to be hewn through.

THE MAGNET : THREE REMEDIES %0a%3c %0a%3c • %0a%3c %0a%3c Upon quitting the marbles to pass on to the other more %0a%3c remarkable stones, who can for a moment doubt that the %0a%3c magnet 17 will be the first to suggest itself? For what, in fact, %0a%3c is there endowed with more marvellous properties than this ? %0a%3c or in which of her departments has Nature displayed a greater %0a%3c degree of waywardness ? She had given a voice to rocks, as %0a%3c already 13 mentioned, and had enabled them to answer man, or %0a%3c rather, I should say, to throw back his own words in his teeth. %0a%3c "What is there in existence more inert than a piece of rigid %0a%3c stone ? And yet, behold ! Nature has here endowed stone with %0a%3c both sense and hands. What is there more stubborn than %0a%3c hard iron ? Nature has, in this instance, bestowed upon it both %0a%3c feet and intelligence. It allows itself, in fact, to be attracted %0a%3c by the magnet, and, itself a metal which subdues all other ele- %0a%3c ments, it precipitates itself towards the source of an influence %0a%3c at once mysterious and unseen. The moment the metal comes %0a%3c near it, it springs towards the magnet, and, as it clasps it, %0a%3c is held fast in the magnet's embraces. Hence it is that this %0a%3c stone is sometimes known by the name of " sideritis ;" 19 another %0a%3c name given to it being " heraclion." 20 It received its name %0a%3c " magnes," Nicander informs us, from the person who was the %0a%3c first to discover it, upon Ida. 21 It is found, too, in various %0a%3c other countries, as in Spain, for example. Magnes, it is said, %0a%3c made this discovery, when, upon taking his herds to pasture, %0a%3c he found that the nails of his shoes and the iron ferrel of his %0a%3c staff adhered to the ground. %0a%3c %0a%3c Sotacus 22 describes five' 23 different kinds of magnet ; the %0a%3c .Ethiopian magnet ; that of Magnesia, a country which borders %0a%3c %0a%3c 17 " Magnes." 18 In Chapter 23 of this Book. %0a%3c %0a%3c 19 "Iron earth;" from oiSnpog, "iron." The magnet, or loadstone %0a%3c itself, is an oxide of iron, known as Oxidulated iron, or Ferroso-fernc %0a%3c oxide ; sometimes in combination with quartz or alumine. %0a%3c %0a%3c 20 From Heraclea, in Lydia, or in Thessaly, according to some ac- %0a%3c counts. It is not improbable, however, that it was so called after " He- %0a%3c racles," or Hercules, on account of its powerful influence upon iron ores. %0a%3c %0a%3c 21 Isidorus says, "India," in B. 16 of the "Origines." %0a%3c %0a%3c 22 See the list of authors at the end of this Book. %0a%3c 21 Varieties, no doubt, of oxide of iron. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 35G %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c plint's natural HISTORT. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Dook XXXVI. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c on Macedonia, and lies to the right of the road which leads from %0a%3c the town of Bcebe to Iolcos ; a third, from Hyettus in Bceotia ; %0a%3c a fourth, from Alexandria in Troas ; and a fifth, from Magnesia %0a%3c in Asia. The leading distinction in magnets is the sex, male %0a%3c and female," and the next great difference in them is the %0a%3c colour. Those of Magnesia, bordering on Macedonia, are of %0a%3c a reddish black : those of Boeotia are more red than black ; and %0a%3c the kind that is found in Troas is black, of the female sex, %0a%3c and consequently destitute of attractive power. The most %0a%3c inferior, however, of all, are those of Magnesia in Asia : they %0a%3c are white, have no attractive influence on iron, and resemble %0a%3c pumice in appearance. It has been found by experience, that %0a%3c the more nearly the magnet approaches to an azure colour, %0a%3c the better it is in quality. The ^Ethiopian magnet is looked %0a%3c upon as the best of all, and is purchased at its weight in silver: %0a%3c Zmiris in Ethiopia is the place where it is found, such being %0a%3c the name of a region there, covered with sand. %0a%3c %0a%3c In the same country, too, the magnet called " haematites" 25 is %0a%3c found, a stone of a blood-red colour, and which, when bruised, %0a%3c yields a tint like that of blood, as also of saffron. The %0a%3c haematites has not the same property 26 of attracting iron that %0a%3c the ordinary magnet has. The Ethiopian magnet is recog- %0a%3c nized by this peculiarity, that it has the property, also, of %0a%3c attracting other magnets to it 27 All these minerals are use- %0a%3c ful as ingredients in ophthalmic preparations, in certain propor- %0a%3c tions according to the nature of each : they are particularly %0a%3c good, too, for arresting defluxions of the eyes. Triturated in %0a%3c a calcined state, they have a healing effect upon burns. %0a%3c %0a%3c In -^Ethiopia, too, not far from Zmiris, there is a mountain %0a%3c in which the stone called " theamedes" 28 is found, a mineral %0a%3c %0a%3c 24 An absurd distinction, as Ajasson remarks; based, probably, on East- %0a%3c ern notions, and with reference to the comparative powers of attraction. %0a%3c %0a%3c 25 From uifxa, "blood."

The stone that is known as " porus," S3 is %0a%3c similar to Parian marble in hardness and whiteness, but is not %0a%3c so heavy. Theophrastus mentions also a transparent stone %0a%3c that is found in Egypt, and is similar to stone of Chios in %0a%3c appearance; it is by no means improbable that it may have %0a%3c existed in his time, for stones, we know, disappear, and new %0a%3c kinds are discovered.

Theophrastus %0a%3c states, also, that a fossil 36 ivory is found, both white and %0a%3c black ; that the earth, too, produces bones, and that osseous 37 %0a%3c stones are sometimes found. In the vicinity of Munda in %0a%3c Spain, the place where the Dictator Caesar defeated Pompeius, 38 %0a%3c there are stones found, which, when broken asunder, bear the %0a%3c impression of palm leaves. 39 %0a%3c %0a%3c There are some black stones, also, which are held in much %0a%3c the same esteem as the marbles ; the Tsenarian 40 stone, for %0a%3c example. Varro says that the black stone of Africa is more %0a%3c durable than that of Italy ; while, on the other hand, the white %0a%3c corani" are harder than Parian marble. He states, also, that %0a%3c %0a%3c 35 Democritus, amongst the ancients, and Savonarola and Cardan, in more %0a%3c recent times, have attributed to stones the powers of reproduction. Vives %0a%3c speaks of certain diamonds which conceive and fructify ; and Avicenna %0a%3c speaks of the selenite or moon-stone of Arabia, which, when suspended %0a%3c from a tree, generates other stones of a similar nature.

PYRITES ; SEVEN REMEDIES. %0a%3c %0a%3c In no country are the molar stones 43 superior to those of %0a%3c Italy ; stones, be it remembered, and not fragments of rock : %0a%3c there are some provinces, too, where they are not to be found %0a%3c at all. Some stones of this class are softer than others, and %0a%3c admit of being smoothed with the whetstone, so as to present %0a%3c all the appearance, at a distance, of ophites. 41 There is no %0a%3c stone of a more durable nature than this ; for in general, stone, %0a%3c like wood, suffers from the action, more or less, of rain, heat, %0a%3c and cold. Some kinds, again, become deteriorated by the action %0a%3c of the moon, while others are apt to contract a rust in lapse of %0a%3c time, or to change their white colour when steeped in oil. %0a%3c %0a%3c (19.) Some persons give this molar stone the name of %0a%3c "pyrites," 45 from the circumstance that it has a great affinity %0a%3c to fire ; 46 but there is also another kind of pyrites, of a more %0a%3c porous nature, and another, 47 again, which resembles copper. %0a%3c This last, it is said, is found in the mines, near Acamas, 48 in the %0a%3c Isle of Cyprus ; one variety of it being of a silver, another of a %0a%3c golden, colour. There are various methods of melting these %0a%3c stones, some persons fusing them twice, or three times even, in %0a%3c honey, till all the liquid has evaporated ; while others, again, %0a%3c calcine them upon hot coals, and, after treating them with %0a%3c honey, wash them like copper. %0a%3c %0a%3c The medicinal properties which these minerals possess are of %0a%3c a calorific, desiccative, dispersive, and resolvent nature, and, %0a%3c %0a%3c in Italy : See B. iii. c. 9.

They are the most ponderous of all, and are found %0a%3c remarkably useful for advance-guards when laying out encamp- %0a%3c ments ; for, on being struck with a nail or any other kind of stone, %0a%3c they emit a spark, which, received upon sulphur, dried fungus, 40 %0a%3c or leaves, produces a fire almost sooner than it could be named. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 31. — OSTRACITES; FOUR BEMEDIES.

GAGATES : SIX BEMF.DIES. %0a%3c %0a%3c Gagates 57 is a stone, so called from Gages, the name of a %0a%3c town and river in Lycia. 68 It is asserted, too, that at Leu- %0a%3c colla 69 the sea throws it up, and that it is found over a space %0a%3c twelve stadia in extent. It is black, smooth, light, and porous, %0a%3c differs but little from wood in appearance, 59 * is of a brittle %0a%3c texture, and emits a disagreeable odour 60 when rubbed. Marks %0a%3c made upon pottery with this stone cannot be effaced. When %0a%3c burnt, it gives out a sulphureous smell; and it is a singular %0a%3c fact, that the application of water ignites it, while that of oil %0a%3c quenches it. 61 The fumes of it, burnt, keep serpents at a dis- %0a%3c tance, and dispel hysterical affections : they detect a tendency %0a%3c also to epilepsy, 62 and act as a test of virginity. 63 A decoction %0a%3c of this stone in wine is curutive of tooth-ache ; and, in combina- %0a%3c tion with wax, it is good for scrofula. The magicians, it is %0a%3c said, make use of gagates in the practice of what they call %0a%3c %0a%3c Me that it derived its .name from /itXi, " honey," in consequence of its %0a%3c colour than by reason of its supposed sweet juices. The Mullite, Melli- %0a%3c r. te, or Honey-stone of modem Mineralogy, also known as Mellate of %0a%3c Alumina, has its name from its honey-yellow colour. It is found in Thu- %0a%3c ringia, Moravia, and Bohemia ; but most probablv was unknown in the %0a%3c days of Pliny. 56 See B. xx. cc. 6, 21. %0a%3c %0a%3c 67 Our jet, which somewhat resembles canncl-coal. and is found in clay %0a%3c soils. %0a%3c %0a%3c 58 See B. v. c. 28, where a place called " Gagae" is mentioned.

The latter is found in mines, and, when burnt, has %0a%3c just the colour 63 of minium. 69 It is calcined in the same %0a%3c manner as Phrygian stone, but is not quenched in wine. Adul- %0a%3c terations of it are detected by the appearance of red veins in it, %0a%3c and by its comparative friabilit)'. It is marvellously useful as %0a%3c an application for bloodshot eyes, and, taken internally, it acts %0a%3c as a check upon female discharges. To patients vomiting %0a%3c blood, it is administered in combination with pomegranate- %0a%3c juiee.

ANDRODAMAS ; TWO REMEDIES. %0a%3c %0a%3c ABABIAN HAEMATITES. MILTITES OR HEFATITES. ANTHRACITES. %0a%3c %0a%3c Sotacus, one of the most ancient Avriters, says, that there are %0a%3c five kinds of hsematites, in addition to the magnet 73 so called. %0a%3c He gives the preference among them to that of ^Ethiopia, 73 a %0a%3c very useful ingredient in ophthalmic preparations and the com- %0a%3c positions which he calls " pancbresta," 74 and good for the cure of %0a%3c burns. The second, he says, is called " androdamas," 76 of a %0a%3c black 76 colour, remarkable for its weight and hardness, to which %0a%3c it owes its name, in fact, and found in Africa more particularly. %0a%3c It attracts silver, he says, copper, and iron, and is tested with %0a%3c a touchstone made of basanites. 77 It yields a liquid the colour %0a%3c of blood, and is an excellent remedy for diseases of the liver. %0a%3c The third kind that he mentions is the haematites 78 of Arabia, a %0a%3c mineral of equal hardness, and which with difficulty yields, %0a%3c upon the water-whetstone, a liquid sometimes approaching the %0a%3c tint of saffron. The fourth 79 kind, he says, is known as "hepa- %0a%3c %0a%3c 70 Literally, " split" stone; so called, probably, from its laminated form. %0a%3c Ajasson identifies it with yellow or brown iron ore, known in Mineralogy %0a%3c a3 Limonite, or Brown Hematite. %0a%3c %0a%3c 71 "Explendis oculorum lacunis." %0a%3c %0a%3c n Mentioned in Chapter 25 of this Book. %0a%3c %0a%3c 73 Mentioned also in Chapter 25. Probably Red peroxide of iron, in a %0a%3c massive form. 11 " Ail-serviceable," or " all-heal." %0a%3c %0a%3c 75 "Man-subduing." %0a%3c %0a%3c 76 The colour of Specular iron, or red peroxide of iron, being of a dark %0a%3c Bteel-grey or iron-black, this is probably another variety of it. Ajasson %0a%3c thinks that it includes compact or massive red oxide of iron, and scaly red %0a%3c iron, or red iron froth, which leaves red marks upon the fingers. %0a%3c %0a%3c 77 See Chapter 11 of this Book. Its alleged attraction of silver and %0a%3c copper is fabulous, no doubt. %0a%3c %0a%3c 73 This is probably the Limonite, or Hydrous peroxide of iron, men- %0a%3c tioned in the preceding Chapter. See Note 70 above. %0a%3c %0a%3c 79 Identified by Ajasson with Red ochre, or Reddle, a red peroxide of %0a%3c iron, used for red crayons in drawing. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 364 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c pliny's natural history.

The fifth 83 %0a%3c variety is schistos ; a substance which, taken internally, arrests %0a%3c haemorrhoidal discharges. Upon the same authority, it is re- %0a%3c commended to take any kind of haematites, fasting, in doses of %0a%3c three drachmae, triturated in oil, for affections of the blood. 8i %0a%3c %0a%3c The same author mentions also a kind of schistos which has no %0a%3c affinity to haematites, and to which he gives the name of " an- %0a%3c thracites." 85 It is a native of Africa, he says, and is of a %0a%3c black colour. When rubbed upon a water- whetstone, it yields %0a%3c a black colour on the side which has adhered to the earth, and, %0a%3c on the opposite side, a saffron tint. He states also that it is a %0a%3c useful ingredient in ophthalmic preparations. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 39. (21) AKTITES. TAPMTJSIAN STONE. CALL1SIUS. %0a%3c %0a%3c The stone called aetites 86 has a great reputation, in conse- %0a%3c quence of the name which it bears. It is found in the neBts %0a%3c of eagles, as already mentioned in our Tenth Book. 87 There %0a%3c are always two of these stones found together, they say, a male %0a%3c stone and a female; and without them, it is said, the various %0a%3c eagles that we have described would be unable to propagate. %0a%3c Hence it is, too, that the young of the eagle are never more %0a%3c than two in number. There are four varieties of the aetites : %0a%3c that of Africa is soft and diminutive, and contains in the %0a%3c interior — in its bowels as it were — a sweet, white, argillaceous %0a%3c earth. It is friable, and is generally thought to be of the %0a%3c female sex. The male stone, on the other hand, which is found %0a%3c in Arabia, is hard, and similar to a nut-gall in appearance; %0a%3c or else of a reddish hue, with a hard stone in the interior. The %0a%3c third kind is a stone found in the Isle of Cyprus, and resembles %0a%3c %0a%3c so « Liver-stone." Not to be confounded with the Hepatite of modern %0a%3c Mineralogy, or Sulphate of Barytes. *i " Spleen-stone." %0a%3c %0a%3c H2 See B. xxxv. c. 14. %0a%3c %0a%3c 83 Identified by Ajasson with Laminated protoxide of iron. It has pro- %0a%3c bably an affinity to the varietv noticed above, in Notes 70 and 78. %0a%3c %0a%3c 8 * Owing solely, in all probability, to its name, " blood-stone." %0a%3c %0a%3c 65 Ajasson is at a loss to know whether this is our Anthracite, a non- %0a%3c bituminous coal, or some kind of bituminous coal. Delafosse takes it to be %0a%3c pit-coal. %0a%3c %0a%3c 81 Or "eagle-stone." It is a Geodes, mentioned in Chapter 23 of this %0a%3c Book, a globular mass of clay iron-stone. Sometimes it is hollow within, %0a%3c and sometimes it encloses another stone, or a little water, or some minerai %0a%3c dust.

It is %0a%3c met with in the beds of- rivers there, and is white and round; %0a%3c having another stone in the interior, the name given to which %0a%3c is " callimus :" none of the varieties of aetites have a smoother %0a%3c surface than this.

It is good, too, for watery dis- %0a%3c charges of a chronic nature, from the eyes.

PUMICE ; JJIXE KE3IED1ES. %0a%3c %0a%3c And here, too, I must not omit to give some account of %0a%3c pumice. 94 This name is very generally given, it is true, to those %0a%3c porous pieces of stone, which we see suspended in the erec- %0a%3c tions known as " musaia," 93 with the view of artificially %0a%3c giving them all the appearance of caverns. But the genuine %0a%3c pumice-stones, that are in use for imparting smoothness to the %0a%3c skin of females, and not females only, but men as well, and, as %0a%3c Catullus 97 says, for polishing books, are found of the finest quality %0a%3c in the islands of Helos and Nisyros 98 and in the ^Eolian Isles. %0a%3c To be good, they should be white, as light as possible, porous and %0a%3c dry in the extreme, friable, and free from sand when rubbed. %0a%3c %0a%3c Considered niedicinallj r , pumice is of a resolvent and desic- %0a%3c cative nature ; for which purpose it is submitted to calcination, %0a%3c no less than three times, on a fire of pure charcoal, it being %0a%3c queuched as often in white wine. It is then washed, like %0a%3c cadmia," and, after being dried, is put by for keeping, in a %0a%3c place as free from damp as possible. In a powdered state, %0a%3c pumice is used in ophthalmic preparations more particularly, %0a%3c and acts as a lenitive detergent upon ulcerations of the eyes. %0a%3c It also makes new flesh upon cicatrizations of those organs, %0a%3c and removes all traces of the marks. Some prefer, after the %0a%3c third calcination, leaving the pumice to cool, and then triturating %0a%3c it in wine. It is employed also as an ingredient in emollient %0a%3c poultices, being extremely useful for ulcerations on the head %0a%3c and generative organs ; dentifrices, too, are prepared from it. %0a%3c According to Theophrastus, 1 persons when drinking for a wager %0a%3c are in the habit 2 of taking powdered pumice first ; but they %0a%3c run great risk, he says, if they fail to swallow the whole %0a%3c draught of wine at once ; it being of so refrigerative a nature %0a%3c %0a%3c « Pumice is still used as the basis of a dentifrice, but it destroys the %0a%3c enamel of the teeth. 95 gee Note 90 above %0a%3c %0a%3c M Or " temples of the Muses :" evidently grottos in the present instance. %0a%3c %0a%3c " In allusion to the line, "Arida modo pumice expolitum" — " J iust %0a%3c polished with dry pumice-stone."

In this %0a%3c respect they have given the preference to Etesian 4 stone before %0a%3c all others, and, next to that, to Thebaic stone, already men- %0a%3c tioned 8 as being called " pyrrhopoecilon," and known as " psa- %0a%3c ranus " by some. The third rank has been assigned to chry- %0a%3c sites, 0 a stone nearly allied to Chalazian 7 stone. lor medicinal %0a%3c purposes, however, basauites 8 has been preferred, this being a %0a%3c stone that remits no particles from its surface. 9 %0a%3c %0a%3c Those stoues which yield a liquid, are generally looked upon %0a%3c as good for the trituration of ophthalmic preparations ; and %0a%3c hence it is, that the ./Ethiopian stone is so much in request for %0a%3c the purpose. Tamarian stone, they say, Phoenician stone, and %0a%3c haematites, are good for the preparation of those medicinal %0a%3c compositions in which saffron forms an ingredient ; but they %0a%3c also speak of another Taenarian stone, of a dark colour, which, %0a%3c like Parian 10 stone, is not so well adapted for medicinal pur- %0a%3c poses. We learn from them, too, that Egyptian alabastrites, 11 %0a%3c or white ophites, 12 from the virtues inherent in them, are con- %0a%3c sidered still better adapted for these purposes than the kinds %0a%3c lust mentioned, It is this kind of ophites, too, from which %0a%3c vessels, and casks even, are made. %0a%3c %0a%3c 3 "Musta."

SOFT STONES. %0a%3c %0a%3c At Siplmos, 13 there is a kind of stone 11 which is hollowed %0a%3c and turned in the lathe, for making cooking-utensils and ves- %0a%3c sels for keeping provisions ; a thing too, that, to my own know- %0a%3c ledge, 15 is done with the green stone 16 of Coinuin 17 in Italy. %0a%3c With reference, however, to the stone of Siphnos, it is a sin- %0a%3c gular fact, that, when heated in oil, though naturally very soft, %0a%3c it becomes hard and black ; so great a difference is there in %0a%3c the qualities of stone. %0a%3c %0a%3c There are some remarkable instances, too, beyond the Alps, of %0a%3c the natural softness of some kinds of stone. In the province %0a%3c of the Belgse, there is a white stone 18 which admits of being cut %0a%3c with the saw that is used for wood, and with greater facility %0a%3c even. This stone is used as a substitute for roof-tiles and %0a%3c gutter-tiles, and even for the kind of roofing known as the %0a%3c pavonaceous 13 style, if that is preferred. Such are the stones %0a%3c that admit of being cut into thin slabs. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 45. SPECULAR STONES. %0a%3c %0a%3c As to specular 30 stone — for this, too, is ranked as one of the %0a%3c stones — it admits of being divided with still greater facility, %0a%3c and can be split into leaves as thin as may be desired. The %0a%3c province of Nearer Spain used formerly to be the only one %0a%3c that furnished it — not, indeed, the whole of that country, but %0a%3c a district extending for a hundred miles around the city of %0a%3c Segobrica. 21 But at the present day, Cyprus, Cappadocia, and %0a%3c Sicily, supply us with it ; and, still more recently, it has been %0a%3c discovered in Africa : they are all, however, looked upon as %0a%3c inferior to the stone which comes from Spain. The sheets %0a%3c %0a%3c 13 See B. iv. cc. 22, 23. %0a%3c %0a%3c 14 Ajasson identifies it with Ollar stone, talc, or soap-stone, a hydrous %0a%3c silicate of magnesia, and nearly allied to the Ophites of Chapters 11 and 30. %0a%3c %0a%3c 15 He being a native of that part of Italy. %0a%3c %0a%3c 16 The Green Colubine Ollar stone, or soap-stone of Italy. %0a%3c %0a%3c 17 See B. iii. c. 21. %0a%3c %0a%3c 18 Identified by Brotero with our Free-stone or grit-stone. %0a%3c %0a%3c 19 So called from its resemblance to the spots on a peacock's tail.

This stone is to be found also in the territory of %0a%3c Bononia, 22 in Italy ; but in small pieces only, covered with %0a%3c spots and encrusted in a bed of silex, there being a consider- %0a%3c able affinity, it would appear, in their nature. %0a%3c %0a%3c In Spain, the specular- stone is extracted from shafts sunk %0a%3c in the earth to a very considerable depth ; though it is occa- %0a%3c sionally to be found just beneath the surface, enclosed in the %0a%3c solid rock, and extracted without difficulty, or else cut away %0a%3c from its bed. In most cases, however, it admits of being dug %0a%3c up, being of an isolated nature, and lying in pieces, like rag- %0a%3c stone, but never known as yet to exceed five feet in length. %0a%3c It would appear that this substance is originally a liquid, %0a%3c which, by an animating power in the earth, becomes congealed %0a%3c like crystal ; and it is very evident that it is the result of pe- %0a%3c trifaction, from the fact that, when animals have fallen into the %0a%3c shafts from which it is extracted, the marrow of their bones %0a%3c becomes transformed into stone of a similar nature, by the end %0a%3c of a single winter. In some cases, too, it is found of a black %0a%3c colour : but the white stone has the marvellous property, soft %0a%3c as it is known to be, of resisting the action of the sun and of %0a%3c cold. Nor will it, if it is only protected from accidents, %0a%3c become deteriorated by lapse of time, a thing that is so gene- %0a%3c rally the case with many other kinds of stone that are used %0a%3c for building purposes. The shavings, too, and scales of this %0a%3c stone, have been used of late for another purpose ; the Circus %0a%3c Maximus having been strewed with them at the celebration of %0a%3c the games, with the object of producing an agreeable white- %0a%3c ness. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 46.

WHETSTONES. %0a%3c %0a%3c We must now pass on to the stones that are employed for %0a%3c handicrafts, and, first of all, whetstones for sharpening iron. %0a%3c Of these stones there are numerous varieties ; the Cretan stones %0a%3c having been long held in the highest estimation, and the next %0a%3c best being those of Mount Taygetus, in Laconia; both of %0a%3c which are used as hones, and require oil. Among the water- %0a%3c whetstones, the first rank belonged to those of Naxos, and the %0a%3c second to the stones of Armenia, both of them already 28 men- %0a%3c tioned. The stones of Cilicia are of excellent quality, whether %0a%3c used with oil or with water ; those of Arsinoe, 29 too, are very %0a%3c good, but with water only.

Still, how- %0a%3c ever, there are some localities which have no other, Carthage, %0a%3c in Africa, for example. It is eaten away by the emanations %0a%3c from the sea, crumbled to dust by the wind, and shattered by %0a%3c the pelting of the rain : but human industry has found the %0a%3c means of protecting walls of houses built of it, with a coating of %0a%3c pitch, as a plaster of lime would corrode it. Hence it is, %0a%3c that we have the well-known saying, " that the Carthaginians %0a%3c use pitch 33 for their houses and lime 34 for their wines," this %0a%3c last being the method used by them in the preparation of their %0a%3c must. %0a%3c %0a%3c In the territories of Fidena? and Alba, in the vicinity of %0a%3c Roine, we find other soft kinds of stone ; and, in Umbria and %0a%3c Venetia, there is a stone 36 which admits of being cut with the %0a%3c teeth of a saw. These stones are easy to be worked, and are %0a%3c capable of supporting a considerable weight, if they are only %0a%3c kept sheltered irom the weather. Rain, however, frost, and dew, %0a%3c split them to pieces, nor can they resist the humidity of the %0a%3c sea-air.

The slabs which have been %0a%3c damaged will be found to be better suited for the foundations %0a%3c under ground : while those, on the other hand, which have re- %0a%3c mained uninjured, may be employed with safety, and exposed %0a%3c to the open air even. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 51. — THE VARIOUS METHODS OP BUILDING. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Greeks construct party- walls, resembling those of brick- %0a%3c work, of hard stone or of silex, squared. This kind of stone- %0a%3c work iswhat theycall "isodomon,"" it being "pseudisodomon"" %0a%3c when the wall is built of materials of unequal dimensions. %0a%3c A third kind of stonework is called " emplecton," 43 the two %0a%3c exteriors only being made with regularity, the rest of the %0a%3c material being thrown in at random. It is necessary that %0a%3c the stones should lie over one another alternately, in such a %0a%3c way that the middle of one stone meets the point of junction %0a%3c of the two below it ; and this, too, in the middle of the wall, %0a%3c if possible ; but if not, at all events, at the sides. When the %0a%3c middle of the wall is filled up with broken stones, the work %0a%3c is known as " diatoichon."" %0a%3c %0a%3c 41 " Built of stones of equal size." %0a%3c %0a%3c 42 " Built of stones of uuequal sizes." %0a%3c %0a%3c 43 " Filled up work," apparently. %0a%3c %0a%3c 4 * The reading is very doubtful here : for the word seems to mean, in %0a%3c Greek, "From one wall to another."

The best plan, too, is to have the cisterns double ; %0a%3c so that all superfluities may settle in the inner cistern, and %0a%3c the water filter through, as pure as possible, into the outer %0a%3c one. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 53. — QUICK-LIME. %0a%3c %0a%3c Cato 47 the Censor disapproves of lime prepared from stones %0a%3c of various colours : that made of white stone is the best. %0a%3c Lime prepared from hard stone is the best for building pur- %0a%3c poses, and that from porous stone for coats of plaster. For %0a%3c both these purposes, lime made from silex is equally rejected. %0a%3c Stone that has been extracted from quarries furnishes a better %0a%3c lime than that collected from the beds of rivers ; but the best of %0a%3c all is the lime that is obtained from the molar-stone, 48 that being %0a%3c of a more unctuous nature than the others. It is something %0a%3c truly marvellous, that quick-lime, after the stone has been sub- %0a%3c jected to fire, should ignite on the application of water ! %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 54. — THE VARIOUS KINDS OF SAND.

PLASTERS FOR WALLS. %0a%3c %0a%3c The great cause of the fall of so many buildings in our City, is, %0a%3c that through a fraudulent abstraction of the lime, the rough %0a%3c work is laid without anything to hold it together. The %0a%3c older, too, the mortar is, the better it is in quality. In the %0a%3c ancient laws for the regulation of building, no contractor was %0a%3c to use mortar less than three months old ; hence it is, that no %0a%3c cracks have disfigured the plaster coatings of their walls. %0a%3c These stuccos will never present a sufficiently bright surface, %0a%3c unless there have been three layers of sanded mortar, and two %0a%3c of marbled 51 mortar upon that. In damp localities and places %0a%3c subject to exhalations from the sea, it is the best plan to sub- %0a%3c stitute ground earthenware mortar for sanded mortar. In %0a%3c Greece, it is the practice, first to pound the lime and sand used %0a%3c for plastering, with wooden pestles in a large trough. The test %0a%3c by which it is known that marbled mortar has been properly %0a%3c blended, is its not adhering to the trowel ; whereas, if it is %0a%3c only wanted for white- washing, the lime, after being well %0a%3c slaked with water, should stick like glue. For this last %0a%3c purpose, however, the lime should only be slaked in lumps. %0a%3c %0a%3c At Elis, there is a Temple of Minerva, which was pargetted, %0a%3c they say, by Panaenus, the brother of Phidias, with a mortar %0a%3c that was blended with milk and saffron : 52 hence it is, that, %0a%3c even at the present day, when rubbed with spittle on the %0a%3c finger, it yields the smell and flavour of saffron. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 56. — COLUMNS. THE SEVERAL KINDS OF COLUMNS. %0a%3c %0a%3c The more closely columns are placed together, the thicker %0a%3c they appear to be. There are four different kinds of pillars. %0a%3c Those of which the diameter at the foot is one-sixth part %0a%3c of the height, are called Doric. When the diameter is one- %0a%3c ninth, they are Ionic ; and when it is one-seventh, Tuscan. %0a%3c The proportions in the Corinthian are the same as those of %0a%3c the Ionic ; but they differ in the circumstance that the %0a%3c Corinthian capitals are of the same height as the diameter %0a%3c at the foot, a thing that gives them a more slender appear- %0a%3c ance ; whereas, in the Ionic column, the height of the %0a%3c capital is only one-third of the diameter at the foot.

In addition to these columns, there are what are %0a%3c called "Attic" columns, quadrangular, and with equal sides. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 57. (24.) — FIVE REMEDIES DERIVED FROM LIME. %0a%3c %0a%3c Lime is also employed very extensively in medicine. For %0a%3c this purpose, fresh lime is selected, which has not been slaked %0a%3c with water. Its properties are caustic, resolvent, and attrac- %0a%3c tive ; and it prevents serpiginous ulcers from spreading, being %0a%3c incorporated with vinegar and oil of roses, for the purpose. %0a%3c When this has been effected, it is tempered with wax and oil of %0a%3c roses, and applied to promote cicatrization. In combination %0a%3c with honey, and liquid resin, or hogs' lard, lime is curative of %0a%3c sprains and scrofulous sores. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 58. MALTHA. %0a%3c %0a%3c Maltha 51 is a cement prepared from fresh lime ; lumps of %0a%3c which are quenched in wine, and then pounded with hogs' %0a%3c lard and figs, both of them, mollifying substances. 55 It is the %0a%3c most tenacious of all cements, and surpasses stone in hardness. %0a%3c Before applying the maltha, the substance upon which it is %0a%3c used must be well rubbed with oil. %0a%3c %0a%3c 53 It seems difficult to understand whether hy the word " spirse" he %0a%3c means astragals, or bases. It would almost appear, by the use of the word %0a%3c " subditae," that it is " bases" for the shafts. It is just possible, how- %0a%3c ever, that the meaning may be that the " spira" were placed beneath the %0a%3c capitals which were added. %0a%3c %0a%3c 51 A different thing altogether from the Maltha or Pissasphalt of B. ii. %0a%3c c. 108. Festus describes it as a mixture of pitch and wax ; and Palladius, %0a%3c in B. i. c. 17, speaks of it as being composed of tar, grease, and lime %0a%3c boiled ; and in c. 35 he describes Maltha caldaria as a mixture of hammo- %0a%3c niacum, figs, tow, tar, and melted suet. It was probably a general name for %0a%3c several kinds of cement. Heineccius says that it was employed for seal- %0a%3c ing, but on what authority does not appear. See Beckmann, Hist.

GYPSUM. %0a%3c %0a%3c Gypsum 56 has a close affinity with limestone, and there are %0a%3c numerous varieties of it. One kind is prepared from a cal- %0a%3c cined 57 stone, as in Syria, and at Thurii, for example. In %0a%3c Cyprus and at Perrhsebia, 68 gypsum is dug out of the earth, %0a%3c and at Tymphsea 69 it is found just below the level of the sod. %0a%3c The stone that is calcined for this purpose, ought to be very %0a%3c similar to alabastrites, 60 or else of a grain like that of marble. %0a%3c In Syria, they select the hardest stones for the purpose, and %0a%3c calcine them with cow-dung, to accelerate the process. Ex- %0a%3c perience has proved, however, that the best plaster of all is %0a%3c that prepared from specular-stone, 41 or any other stone that is %0a%3c similarly laminated. Gypsum, when moistened, must be used %0a%3c immediately, as it hardens with the greatest rapidity; it %0a%3c admits, however, of being triturated over again, and so reduced %0a%3c to powder. It is very useful for pargetting, and has a %0a%3c pleasing effect when used for ornamental figures and wreaths %0a%3c in buildings. %0a%3c %0a%3c There is one remarkable fact connected with this substance ; %0a%3c Caius Proculeius, 62 an intimate friend of the Emperor Augustus, %0a%3c suffering from violent pains in the stomach, swallowed gyp- %0a%3c sum, and so put an end to his existence. 63 %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 60.

Since his time, these %0a%3c mosaics have left the ground for the arched roofs of houses, %0a%3c and they are now made of glass. This, however, is but a %0a%3c recent invention ; for there can be no doubt that, when Agrippa %0a%3c ordered the earthenware walls of the hot baths, in the %0a%3c Thermae which he was building at Eome, to be painted in %0a%3c encaustic, and had the other parts coated with pargetting, he %0a%3c %0a%3c 73 " Quercus." %0a%3c %0a%3c 11 " Spicata testacea." These pavements were probably so called be- %0a%3c cause the bricks were laid at angles to each other (of about forty-five %0a%3c degrees), like the grains in an ear of wheat ; or like the spines projecting %0a%3c from either side of the back-bone of a fish.

It will be as well, therefore, to give %0a%3c some account, also, of glass. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 65. (26.) THE OBIGIN OF GLASS. %0a%3c %0a%3c In Syria there is a region known as Phcenice, 77 adjoining to %0a%3c Judoea, and enclosing, between the lower ridges of Mount %0a%3c Carmelus, a marshy 7 district known by the name of Cendebia. %0a%3c In this district, it is supposed, rises the river Belus, 78 which, %0a%3c after a course of five miles, empties itself into the sea near the %0a%3c colony of Ptolemais. The tide of this river is sluggish, and %0a%3c the water unwholesome to drink, but held sacred for the %0a%3c observance of certain religious ceremonials. Full of slimy %0a%3c deposits, and very deep, it is only at the reflux of the tide %0a%3c that the river discloses its sands; which, agitated by the %0a%3c waves, separate themselves from their impurities, and so %0a%3c become cleansed. It is generally thought that it is the %0a%3c acridity of the sea- water that has this purgative effect upon %0a%3c the sand, and that without this action no use could be made %0a%3c of it. The shore upon which this sand is gathered is not %0a%3c more than half a mile in extent ; and yet, for many ages, this %0a%3c was the only spot that afforded the material for making glass. i %0a%3c %0a%3c The story is, that a ship, laden with nitre, 19 being moored %0a%3c upon this spot, the merchants, while preparing their repast %0a%3c upon the sea-shore, finding no stones at hand for supporting %0a%3c their cauldrons, employed for the purpose some lumps of nitre %0a%3c which they had taken from the vessel. Upon its being sub- %0a%3c jected to the action of the fire, in combination with the sand %0a%3c of the sea-shore, they beheld transparent streams flowing forth %0a%3c of a liquid hitherto unknown : this, it is said, was the origin %0a%3c of glass. 80 %0a%3c %0a%3c 76 In Chapter 24 of this Book. 11 See B. v. c. 17. %0a%3c %0a%3c 78 See B. v. c. 19. %0a%3c %0a%3c 79 A mineral alkali, Beckmann thinks ; for it could not possibly be our %0a%3c saltpetre, he says.

In a %0a%3c similar manner, too, brilliant stones of various descriptions %0a%3c came to be added in the melting, and, at last, shells and fossil %0a%3c sand. Some authors tell us, that the glass of India is made of %0a%3c broken crystal, and that, in consequence, there is none that %0a%3c can be compared to it. %0a%3c %0a%3c In fusing it, light and dry wood is used for fuel, Cyprian %0a%3c copper and nitre being added to the melting, nitre of Ophir 83 %0a%3c more particularly. It is melted, like copper, in contiguous %0a%3c furnaces, and a swarthy mass of an unctuous appearance is the %0a%3c result. Of such a penetrating nature is the molten glass, that %0a%3c it will cut to the very bone any part of the body which it %0a%3c may come near, and that, too, before it is even felt. This %0a%3c mass is again subjected to fusion in the furnace, for the pur- %0a%3c pose of colouring it ; after which, the glass is either blown %0a%3c into various forms, turned in a lathe, or engraved 84 like silver. %0a%3c Sidon was formerly famous for its glass-houses, for it was this %0a%3c place that first invented 85 mirrors. %0a%3c %0a%3c 81 " Magnes lapis." See B. xxxiv. c. 42, and Chapter 25 of this Book. %0a%3c Beckmann is of opinion that an ore of Manganese is meant, a substance %0a%3c which has a resemblance to the magnet, and is of the greatest utility ia %0a%3c making glass. Hist. Inv. Vol. II. p. 237. %0a%3c %0a%3c 82 This appears to be the meaning of " Quoniam in se liquorem vitri %0a%3c quoque utferrum trahere creditur." %0a%3c %0a%3c 83 In the description given by Isidorusin the " Origines," which in other %0a%3c respects is similar, these words are omitted, and it is possible that they are %0a%3c a gloss by some one who was better acquainted with the Old Testament %0a%3c than with Pliny. On the other hand, as Sillig remarks, the Phoenicians %0a%3c may, at an early period, have imported into Greece a substance which they %0a%3c called " nitre of Ophir." %0a%3c %0a%3c 8i See Beckmann, Hist. Inv. Vol. II. p. 84. %0a%3c %0a%3c 85 " Excogitaverat." Beckmann would seem to give this word the %0a%3c force only of " thought of," for he gives it as his opinion that attempts %0a%3c were made at Sidon to form glass mirrors, but that the experiments had %0a%3c not completely succeeded. " Had this invention formed an epoch in the %0a%3c art of making mirrors, Pliny, in another place (B. xxxiii. c. 45), where %0a%3c he describes the various improvements of it so fully, would not have omit- %0a%3c ted it: but of those experiments he makes no further mention." He ako %0a%3c expresses an opinion that the Sidonian mirrors consisted of dark-coloured %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Ohap. 67.J %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c OBSIAJT GLASS. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 381 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Such was the ancient method of making glass: but, at the %0a%3c present day, there is found a very white sand for the purpose, %0a%3c at the mouth of the river Volturuus, in Italy. It spreads %0a%3c over an extent of six miles, upon the sea-shore that lies %0a%3c between Cumae and Liternum, and is prepared for use by %0a%3c pounding it with a pestle and mortar; which done, it is mixed %0a%3c with three parts of nitre, either by weight or measure, and, %0a%3c when fused, is transferred to another furnace. Here it forms %0a%3c a mass of what is called " hammonitrum ;" which is again %0a%3c submitted to fusion, and becomes a mass of pure, white, glass. %0a%3c Indeed, at the present day, throughout the Gallic and Spanish %0a%3c provinces even, we find sand subjected to a similar process. %0a%3c In the reign of Tiberius, it is said, a combination was devised %0a%3c which produced a flexible 86 glass ; but the manufactory of the %0a%3c artist was totally destroyed, we are told, in order to prevent the %0a%3c value of copper, silver, and gold, from becoming depreciated." %0a%3c This story, however, was, for a long time, more widely spread %0a%3c than well authenticated. But be it as it may, it is of little %0a%3c consequence ; for, in the time of the Emperor Nero, there was a %0a%3c process discovered, by which two small glass cups were made, %0a%3c of the kind called " petroti." 88 the price of which was no less %0a%3c than six thousand sesterces ! %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP 67. — OBSIAN GLASS AND OBSIAN STONE. %0a%3c %0a%3c Among the various kinds of glass, we may also reckon %0a%3c Obsian glass, a substance very similar to the stone 89 which %0a%3c Obsius discovered in ^Ethiopia. This stone is of a very dark %0a%3c colour, and sometimes transparent; but it is dull to the sight, %0a%3c and reflects, when attached as a mirror to walls, the shadow %0a%3c of the object rather than the image. Many persons use it 90 %0a%3c %0a%3c glass, resembling obsidian stone.'*— Hist. Inv. Vol. II. pp. 69, 70. £ohn's %0a%3c Edition. . „.„ %0a%3c %0a%3c 96 Knowles says, in his Turkish History, p. 1273, that in 1610, among %0a%3c other rare presents sent to the King of Spain from the Sophy of Persia, %0a%3c there were six drinking-glasses, made of malleable glass so exquisitely %0a%3c tempered that they could not be broken. %0a%3c %0a%3c « Dion Cassias and Suetonius tell a similar story ; and, according to one %0a%3c account, Tiberius ordered the artist to be put to death. %0a%3c %0a%3c «» This reading is doubtful. It would appear to mean " stone handled. %0a%3c Another reading is " pterotos," " with winged handles." %0a%3c %0a%3c *> Volcanic glass, feldspar in a more or less pure state, our Obsidian, ib %0a%3c probably meant; a word derived from the old reading, Obsidius, corrected %0a%3c by Sillig to Obsius. . , . %0a%3c %0a%3c *> He is speaking of the stone, not the glass that resembled it %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 382 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c PLINY'S NATUBAL IIISTOBY.

That prince consecrated, in the Temple of Con- %0a%3c cord, as something marvellous, four figures of elephants made %0a%3c of Obsian stone. Tiberius Caesar, too, restored to the people %0a%3c of Hcliopolis, as an object of ceremonial worship, an image in %0a%3c this stone, which had been found among the propert) r left by %0a%3c one of the praefects of Egypt. It was a figure of Menelaiis ; a %0a%3c circumstance which goes fur towards proving that the use of %0a%3c this material is of more ancient date than is generally sup- %0a%3c posed, confounded as it is at the present day with glass, by %0a%3c reason of its resemblance. Xenocrates says that Obsian stone %0a%3c is found in India also, and in Samnium in Italy; and that it %0a%3c is a natural product of Spain, upon the coasts which border %0a%3c on the Ocean. 92 %0a%3c %0a%3c There is an artificial Obsian stone, made of coloured glass %0a%3c for services for the table ; and there is also a glass that is red %0a%3c all through, and opaque, known as " hsematinum." 93 A dead %0a%3c white glass, too, is made, as also other kinds in imitation of mur- %0a%3c rhine 94 colour, hyacinthine, sapphire, and every other tint: %0a%3c indeed, there is no material of a more pliable 95 nature than %0a%3c this, or better suited for colouring. Still, however, the %0a%3c highest value is set upon glass that is entirely colourless and %0a%3c transparent, as nearly as possible resembling crystal, in fact. %0a%3c For drinking-vessels, glass lias quite superseded the use of %0a%3c silver and gold ; but it is unable to stand heat unless a %0a%3c cold liquid is poured in first. And yet, we find that globular %0a%3c glass vessels, filled with water, when brought in contact with %0a%3c the rays of the sun, 96 become heated to such a degree as to %0a%3c cause articles of clothing to ignite.

Submit to its action some sandy soil, %0a%3c and in one place it will yield glass, in another silver, in %0a%3c another minium, and in others, again, lead and its several %0a%3c varieties, pigments, and numerous medicaments. It is through %0a%3c the agency of fire that stones 98 are melted into copper; by fire %0a%3c that iron is produced, and subdued to our purposes ; by fire %0a%3c that gold is purified ; by fire, too, that the stone is calcined, %0a%3c which is to hold together the Avails of our houses. %0a%3c %0a%3c Some materials, again, are all the better for being repeatedly %0a%3c submitted to the action of fire ; and the same substance will %0a%3c yield one product at the first fusion, another at the second, and %0a%3c another at the third. 99 Charcoal, when it has passed through fire %0a%3c and has been quenched, only begins to assume its active pro- %0a%3c perties ; and, when it might be supposed to have been reduced %0a%3c to annihilation, it is then that it has its greatest energies.
