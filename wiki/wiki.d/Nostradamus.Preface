Consider also the saying of our %0aSaviour, “Nolite sanctum dare canibus neque mittalis margaritas vestras %0aante porcos, ne forte couculcent eas pedibus suis, et conversi ditumpant %0avas.” (Matt. vii. 6 %0a%0aTor this reason I have withheld my tongue from the vulgar, and my %0apen from paper. But, afterwards, I was willing for the common good to %0aenlarge myself in dark and abstruse sentences, declaring the future events, %0achiefly the most urgent and those which I foresaw (whatever human %0amutalion happened) would not offend the heasers, all under dark figures %0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a* “Such alone as ate inspired by the divine power can predict particular events in a %0aspirit of prophecy.” : %0a3 %0a%0a%0a4 COMPLETE PROPHEGIBS OF NOSTRADAMUS %0a%0a%0amore than prophetical. Although “Abscondidisti hoce a sapientibus, ct %0aptudentibus, id est, potentibus ct regibus, ct cnucleasti ca exignis ct %0atenibus.” * ‘The prophets, by meaus.only of the nnmortal Ged and %0agood Angels, have received the spirit of vaticination, by which they foresee %0athings, and foretell future events, Mor nothing is perfect without Tim, %0awhose power and goodness are so great to Tis creatures, that though they %0aave but men, nevertheless by the likeness of their good genius to the %0aAngels, this heat and prophetical power draws near us, as do the rays of %0athe sun, which cast their influence alike upon bodies that are clementary %0aand non-clementary. As for us, who are but men, we cannot attain %0aanything by our natwal knowledge, of the scerets of God our Creator, %0a“Quia non cst uostrum noscere tempora, nce momenta,” ete, (Acts i, 2) %0a%0a‘There are, or may come some persons, to whom God Alnighty will %0areveal by impressions made on their understanding some scerels of the %0afuture, according to judicial astrology, as it hath happened in former times, %0awhen a certain power and voluntary facully possessed them as a flanie of %0afic. So by Lis inspiration, they were able to judge of divine and human %0athings, for the divine works that are absolutely necessary, God will %0acomplete, - %0a%0aBut, my son, I speak to thee a liltle too Sbaearaly There are scerets %0athat are received by the subile spirit of fire, by which the understandin, %0ais moved to contemplate the highest celestial bodies, being active and %0avigilant to the very pronunciation without fear or any shameful loquacity; %0aall of which proceeded from the divine power of the Iiternal God, from %0awhom all goodness flows. ‘ %0a%0aNow, my son, although 1 have inserted the name of prophet here, %0aI will not attribute to myself so sublime a title, for “Prophela dicitur hodie, %0aolim vocabatar videns,” ** and prophels are those properly, my son, that %0asee things remote from the uatural eras 2 of mankind. Or, to put the %0acase, the prophets, by the means of the perfect light of prophecy, may see %0adivine things as wall as human (which cannat but he seeing the effects %0aof future predictions) and do extend a great distance, for the secrets of %0aGod are incomprehensible, and their cflicient power is far remote from the %0analural knowledge, taking their origin in the free will, causing those things %0ato appear which otherwise could not be known, neither by human augurics %0anor by any hidden knowledge or secret virtue under Teaven, Only by the %0ameans of some indivisible cternal being, and by [erculcan agitation the %0acauses come to be known by the celestial motion, %0a%0aT say, therefore, my son, that you may not understand me well, because %0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a4 %0a* Thou hast hidden these Uhings from the wise ond prudent and hast revealed then %0ato the small and weak.” %0a** "IIe who is called prophet now, ance was culled sees.” %0a%0a%0a' %0aPREFACE YO FIRST EDITION 5 %0a%0a%0athe knowledge of this matter cannot yet be imprinted in thy weak brain, %0aFuture causes afar off are subject to the knowledge of human creaLures, %0aif (notwithstanding the Creator) things present and future were neither %0aobscure nor hidden fron: the intellectual seal; but the perfect knowledge %0aof the cause of things cannot be acquired without the divine inspiration, %0aseeing that all prophetical inspiration received hath its original principle %0afrom God the Creator, next, from good luck, and afterwards from nature, %0aTherefore, causes, independently produced or not produced, the prophecy %0apartly happens where it hath becn foretold, for the understanding being %0aintellectually created cannot sce occult things, unless it be by the voice %0acoming from the limbo, by the means of the thin flame, to which the %0aknowledge of future causes is inclined. And, also, my son, I entreat thee %0anot to bestow thy understanding on such fopperics which dry up the body %0aand damm the soul, and bring vexation to the senses, Chiefly abhor the %0avanily of the exccrable magic forbidden by the Sacred Scriptures and by %0athe Canons of the Church; except from this judicial astrology by which, %0aand by the means of divine inspiration, with continual calculations; we %0ahave put in writing, our prophecics, %0aAlthough this occult philosophy was not forbidden, I could never be %0a%0acrsuaded to meddle with it, altuonah many volumes concerning that art, %0awhich hath been concealed a great while, were presented to me. But %0a* fearing what might happen, after I had read them, I presented them to %0aVulcan and, while he was devouring them, the flame mixed with the air, %0athere was an unwonted light more bright than the usual flame and it was, %0aas if there were lightning, shining all the house over, as if it had been all %0aina flame, Therefore, that henceforth you might not be abused in the %0asearch of the perfect transformation, as much lunar as solar, and to scek %0a. in the waters ncorruptible metal, I have burnt them all to ashes, But as %0a%0ato the judgment dite cometh to be perfected by the help of the celestial %0ajudgment, that I will manifest to you that you may have knowledge of %0afuture things; rejecting the fantastic imaginations that may arisc, and: %0alimiting the particularity of places which were arrived at ¥ divine and %0asupernatural inspiration, according to the celestial figures, by an occult %0aproperty, and by a divine virtue, power and faculty—in the presence %0aof which the three aspects of time are comprehended by cternity, an %0aevolution that ties into one the cause that is past, present, and future; %0a“quia ommia sunt muda ct aperta. . .” * . %0a%0aTherefore, my son, thou mayst, notwithstanding thy tender brain, com- %0a%0aprcherid things that shall happen hereafter, and may be foretold b %0acelestial natural lights, and by the spirit of prophecy, not that I will %0aattribute to myself the name of a prophet, but as a mortal man, being no %0a%0a%0a* “For all things are naked and open.” %0a%0a%0a6 COMPLETE PROPHECIES OF NOSTRADAMUS %0a%0a%0afarther from Ueaven by my sense than I am from Marth by my fect, %0a“Possum non errare, falli, decipi,” * (albeit) I am the greatest simmer %0aof the world subject to all human afflictions. But being suprised some- %0atimes by a prophictical mood, and by a long calculation, pleasing myself %0ain my study, I have made Books of Prophecies, cach one containing a %0ahundred Astronomical Stanzas, which I have joined obscurely, and are %0aperpetual prophecies from this year to the year 3797, at which some per- %0ahaps will Fons secing so large an extension of tune, and that I treat of %0aeverything under the Moon. If thou livest the natmal age of a man thou %0ashalt see in thy climate, and under the Ieaven of thy nativity, the future %0athings that have been forctold. . %0a%0aGod only knoweth the cternily of the light proceeding from Ilimself, %0aand I say freely to those to whom Ilis incomprehensible greatness hath by %0aa long melancholic inspiration revealed, that ‘by the means of this occult %0acause, divinely manifested, chiefly by two principal causes, there is compre- %0ahension and undeistanding in hin that is inspired and prophetic, One is %0athat which cleareth the supernatmal light and foretclleth. by the doc- %0atine of the planets, and the other forecasts hy inspired revelation, which %0ais a kind of participation in the divine cternily, by means of Tim, of God %0athe Cicator, And by these incans he knows that what is predicted is true, %0aand hath taken its original from above, and such light and small flame is %0aof all efficacy and sublimity, no less than the natural light makes the %0aphilosopheis so secure, that by the means of the principles of the first %0acause, they have attained the greatest depth of the profoundest sciences, %0a%0aBul I must not wander too far, my son, from the capacity of thy sense. %0aI find that learning shall be at a great loss, and that before the universal %0aconflagration shall happen so many great inundations, that there shall %0asemce be any land that shall not be covered with water, aud this shall last %0aso long, that except for Ithnographies and 'Vopographies all shall perish, %0aBefore and _afler these imidations in many countries there shall be such %0asearcily of rain and such a great deal of fire, and burming stones shall fall %0afrom Heaven, that nothing unconsumed shall be left. Al this shall happen %0aa litle while before the great conflagralion, %0a%0aAlthough the planel Mars makes an end of his coutse, and is come %0ato the end of his last period, nevertheless he shall begin it again. Some %0ashall be gathered in Aquarius for many years, others in Cancer also for %0amany years, Now we are governed by the Moon, ‘mder the power of %0aAlmighty God; which Moon before she hath finished her circuil, the Sun %0ashall come, and then Saturn. According to the celestial signs, the reign %0aof Saturn shall come again, so that all being calculated, the world draws %0a%0a" near to its anaragonic revolution («cath-dealing). %0a%0a%0a* “Tam able nol to err, be deceived nor fail.” %0a%0a%0at %0aPREVAGK TO FIRST EDITION 7 %0a%0a%0aFrom this present time that I write this, before 177 years, three months, « %0aeleven days, thiough pestilence, famine, war, and for the most part, inun- %0adations, the world between this and that prefixed time, before and after, %0afor several Limes shall be so diminished, and the people shall be so few, %0athat they shall not find enough to till the ground, so that they shall remain %0afallaw as long as they had once been tilled. We are now in the seventh %0amillenary, which ends all and brings us near the eighth, where the firma- %0ament of the cighth sphere is, which, in a latiludinary dimension, is the %0aplace where the Great God shall make an end of this revolution, where %0athe celestial bodies shall move again, and the superior motion that maketh %0athe Iaith firm and stable, “non inclinabitur in seculum seculorum,” * %0aunless [is will be accomplished and not otherwise. %0a%0aAlthough by ambiguous opinions exceeding all natural reasons by %0aMahometical dreams, also sometimes God the Cieator by the ministers of %0aHis messengers of fire and flame, shows to our extemal senses, and chiefly %0ato our cyes, the causes of future predictions, signifying the future event, %0athat will manifest to him that prophesics. For the prophecy thai is made %0aby the internal light, comes to judge of the thing partly with and by the %0ameans of exteinal light, although the part which secmeth to come by %0aUhe eye of understanding, comes only from the lesion of its imaginative %0asense, ‘Tha reason is evident why what he forctclleth comes by divine %0ainspiration, or by the means of an angelical spirit, inspired into the %0aeles person, anointing him with vaticinations, moving the fore part %0aof his fancy, by divers nocturnal apparitions, so that by aslronomical %0aadministrations, he prophesies with a divine cerlilude, joined to the holy %0aeg of the future, having no other regard than to the freedom of %0aris mind, %0a%0aCome now, my son, and understand that I find by my revelations %0a(asleological), which agree with the divine inspiration, that the swords %0adraw near to us now, and the plague and the war more horrid than hath %0abeen seen in the life of three men before, and also famine, which shall %0areturn often, for the stars agree with the revolution, “Visitabo in virga ferrea %0ainiguitates corum, et in verberibus percutiam cos,” ** For the mercies of %0aGod shall not be spread for a while, my son, before most of my prophecies %0ashall come Lo pass, thus oftentimes shall happen sinister storms. “Conteram %0aogo, ct confringam,” (said the Lord) “et non misercbor.” + And a thousand %0aother accidents shall happen by waters and continual rains, as I have more %0afully at large declared in my other Prophecies, wrilten in soluta oratione, %0alimiting the places, times and prefixed terms, that men coming after, may %0a%0a%0a* “Whence it shall not deviate from age to age” ee P %0a#* T will visit their iniquities with a rod of iron, and with blows will strike them,’ %0a%0a%0a+ "I will trample them and break them, and not show pity.” %0a%0a%0a8 COMPLI PROPHECINS OF NOSIRADAMUS %0a%0a%0asee and know that those accidents ate certainly come to pass, a8 we have %0amaiked in other places, speaking more clealy, although the explication %0ahe involved in obsetity: “Sed qnaudo submoventa erif ignorantia®s * the %0ause shall be made more clon. Making an end here, my son, accept this %0agifl of thy fathei, Michacl Nostiadamus, hoping to expound to thee eve %0aprophecy of these quatrains, praying to the Immortal God that he will %0agrant thee a long life in felicily. ; %0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a* When the time arrives for the removal of ignorance,” %0a%0a%0aFrom Sulon, this 1st of March, 1553,

According to the celestial signs, the reign %0a%3c of Saturn shall come again, so that all being calculated, the world draws %0a%3c %0a%3c " near to its anaragonic revolution («cath-dealing). %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c * “Tam able nol to err, be deceived nor fail.” %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c t %0a%3c PREVAGK TO FIRST EDITION 7 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c From this present time that I write this, before 177 years, three months, « %0a%3c eleven days, thiough pestilence, famine, war, and for the most part, inun- %0a%3c dations, the world between this and that prefixed time, before and after, %0a%3c for several Limes shall be so diminished, and the people shall be so few, %0a%3c that they shall not find enough to till the ground, so that they shall remain %0a%3c fallaw as long as they had once been tilled. We are now in the seventh %0a%3c millenary, which ends all and brings us near the eighth, where the firma- %0a%3c ment of the cighth sphere is, which, in a latiludinary dimension, is the %0a%3c place where the Great God shall make an end of this revolution, where %0a%3c the celestial bodies shall move again, and the superior motion that maketh %0a%3c the Iaith firm and stable, “non inclinabitur in seculum seculorum,” * %0a%3c unless [is will be accomplished and not otherwise. %0a%3c %0a%3c Although by ambiguous opinions exceeding all natural reasons by %0a%3c Mahometical dreams, also sometimes God the Cieator by the ministers of %0a%3c His messengers of fire and flame, shows to our extemal senses, and chiefly %0a%3c to our cyes, the causes of future predictions, signifying the future event, %0a%3c that will manifest to him that prophesics. For the prophecy thai is made %0a%3c by the internal light, comes to judge of the thing partly with and by the %0a%3c means of exteinal light, although the part which secmeth to come by %0a%3c Uhe eye of understanding, comes only from the lesion of its imaginative %0a%3c sense, ‘Tha reason is evident why what he forctclleth comes by divine %0a%3c inspiration, or by the means of an angelical spirit, inspired into the %0a%3c eles person, anointing him with vaticinations, moving the fore part %0a%3c of his fancy, by divers nocturnal apparitions, so that by aslronomical %0a%3c administrations, he prophesies with a divine cerlilude, joined to the holy %0a%3c eg of the future, having no other regard than to the freedom of %0a%3c ris mind, %0a%3c %0a%3c Come now, my son, and understand that I find by my revelations %0a%3c (asleological), which agree with the divine inspiration, that the swords %0a%3c draw near to us now, and the plague and the war more horrid than hath %0a%3c been seen in the life of three men before, and also famine, which shall %0a%3c return often, for the stars agree with the revolution, “Visitabo in virga ferrea %0a%3c iniguitates corum, et in verberibus percutiam cos,” ** For the mercies of %0a%3c God shall not be spread for a while, my son, before most of my prophecies %0a%3c shall come Lo pass, thus oftentimes shall happen sinister storms. “Conteram %0a%3c ogo, ct confringam,” (said the Lord) “et non misercbor.” + And a thousand %0a%3c other accidents shall happen by waters and continual rains, as I have more %0a%3c fully at large declared in my other Prophecies, wrilten in soluta oratione, %0a%3c limiting the places, times and prefixed terms, that men coming after, may %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c * “Whence it shall not deviate from age to age” ee P %0a%3c #* T will visit their iniquities with a rod of iron, and with blows will strike them,’ %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c + "I will trample them and break them, and not show pity.” %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 8 COMPLI PROPHECINS OF NOSIRADAMUS %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c see and know that those accidents ate certainly come to pass, a8 we have %0a%3c maiked in other places, speaking more clealy, although the explication %0a%3c he involved in obsetity: “Sed qnaudo submoventa erif ignorantia®s * the %0a%3c use shall be made more clon.
