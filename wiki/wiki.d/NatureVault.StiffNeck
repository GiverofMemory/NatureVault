This was after taking [[vitamin e]] and [[potassium]] for [[heart palpitations]] which helped the heart.  Also have been eating lots of [[carrots]] lately for the palpitations. Tried [[peppermint]] and [[cinnamon]] eo on the neck with no effect.  Took [[lavender]] and [[garlic]] to no effect.  Took [[activated charcoal]] to no effect. Took more vit e and made it worse.  Have been nauseous a bit lately so may be listeria, will try [[thyme]] and [[eucalyptus]] on my neck next along with [[ellagic acid]] internally.  Turns out vitamin e generally kills listeria [[ https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14601733/|#]] so this stiff neck might be a listeria detox.
