text=The Night of the Bride %0a%0a%0a%0a125. Rabbi Shimon was sitting and studying the Torah on the night when the %0aBride, Malchut, unites with her husband, Zeir Anpin. And all the friends %0apresent in the bridal chamber on that night, the eve of the holiday of Shavuot %0a(Pentecost), must stand together with the bridegroom under the Huppah %0a(wedding canopy), and be with him this whole night, and rejoice with him %0ain the corrections of the Bride, i.e., study the Torah, then Prophets, then %0aHoly Scriptures, and finally the wisdom, for these corrections are the Bride's %0aadornments. And the Bride receives corrections, adorns herself with them, %0aand rejoices with them all of that night. And on the next day, on the holiday of %0aShavuot, she only comes to the Huppah together with them. And her friends, %0awho studied the Torah all night long, are called the sons of the Huppah. And as %0ashe approaches the Huppah, the Creator asks about them, blesses and adorns %0athem with the Bride's adornments. Happy are those who merit this! %0a%0aAll the days of exile are called night, for this is when the Creator's face is %0aconcealed from Israel, as the impure forces rule and separate His loyal servants %0afrom Him. Yet, this is the time when the bride unites with her husband (in %0aHebrew, "husband" and "master" are the same word, so one must keep in mind %0athe second meaning of the word as well). The Huppah is a wedding canopy, under %0awhich the ritual of union between a bride and a bridegroom (their merging in %0aa Zivug) takes place. %0a%0aThe union between the bride and her husband (The Zohar uses the word %0a"husband" instead of "bridegroom") occurs thanks to the Torah and Mitzvot %0a(commandments) of the righteous, referred to as "those who keep the Torah." %0aAnd all the Supernal Degrees, called "secrets of the Torah," become revealed %0athanks to them alone, for they are also called MAKERS (as though CREATING %0athe Torah itself), as is described in item 124. Therefore, the time of exile is called %0athe NIGHT WHEN THE BRIDE UNITES WITH HER HUSBAND. AND %0a%0a%0a%0a281 %0a%0a%0a%0a282 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aALL THE FRIENDS, THE SONS OF THE BRIDE'S JOY, ARE CALLED %0aTHOSE WHO KEEP THE TORAH. %0a%0aAnd after THE END OF CORRECTION and complete deliverance, of %0awhich the prophet Zachariah writes (14:7): "And there shall be one day, which %0ashall be known to the Creator, neither day nor night, but it shall come to pass %0acome evening time: there shall be light." THE NEXT DAY, THE BRIDE AND %0aHER HUSBAND ENTER THE HUPPAH, for BON will become like SAG and %0aMA will be like AB (see item 64). %0a%0aThis state is therefore defined as the next day and a new Huppah. Whereas %0aat this time (in this state), the righteous are called SONS OF THE HUPPAH, %0ain whom there is no action, for then, as it is written: "They shall not do evil %0aupon My holy mountain, for the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the %0aCreator, as waters cover the sea" (Yeshayahu, 11:9). %0a%0aAnd since these righteous elevated BON to SAG by their actions, i.e., made %0aits properties similar to those of SAG, they are considered to have made a new %0aHuppah, they are called "sons of the Huppah." %0a%0aThe night of Shavuot (Pentecost) is when THE BRIDE UNITES WITH HER %0aHUSBAND, for the Huppah takes place on the next day, the day of Shavuot, the %0aday of the reception of the Torah. On that day, all of creation achieves the state %0aof the end of correction, as it is said: "He will swallow up death forever; and the %0aCreator Himself will wipe away the tears off all faces" (Yeshayahu, 25:8). %0a%0aThe Torah describes this state as "engraved upon the scrolls" (Shemot, 32: 16). %0aIn Hebrew, the word "engraved" is Harut, but it should be pronounced Herut %0a(freedom), freedom from the angel of death. However, the sin of the golden calf %0afollowed and the High Degree was lost. Since Shavuot is the day when the Torah %0awas received, it is also regarded as the end of correction. %0a%0aTherefore, all the necessary preparations (the corrections carried out %0aduring the concealment period) are completed beforehand, on the night %0abefore the holiday of Shavuot. This night is hence defined as the night when %0athe bride unites with her husband so as to enter the Huppah the following %0aday, on the holiday of Shavuot, when all the corrections are completed and %0aliberated from the angel of death, thanks to the actions of the righteous, who %0aerect a new Hu£>£>ah. %0a%0aAll of the bride's friends, those who keep the Torah, also called "sons of %0athe bridal chamber," must be merged with the Shechina-Malchut (the bride) all %0aof that night, called "exile." Only then do their acts in the Torah and Mitzvot %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Night of the Bride %0a%0a%0a%0a283 %0a%0a%0a%0acorrect and purify the good in her from the taint of evil, so she would emerge %0awith the properties that contain only good, without evil. %0a%0aHence, those who keep the Torah should rejoice together with the bride %0afor all the great corrections that they've made in her. Then they joyously %0acontinue with their corrections in THE TORAH, then in PROPHETS and %0afinally in the HOLY SCRIPTURES. All the degrees and revelations of the %0asecrets of the Torah, which make up the framework of the Shechina herself at %0athe end of her correction, are made exclusively by the righteous, who keep the %0aTorah during the exile. %0a%0aTherefore, all the degrees that emerge at the time (state) of the exile are %0acalled the bride's corrections and adornments from the Torah, Prophets and %0aHoly Scriptures, for Sefirot Hesed, Gevura, and Tifferet constitute the Torah, Sefirot %0aNet^ah, Hod, and Yesod are the Prophets, and Malchut is the Holy Scriptures. The %0aLight of VAK is called Midrashim and the Light of GAR is called "the secrets of %0athe Torah." And all these corrections must be made in Malchut (the bride) on %0athe night when she completes her corrections (precisely in the darkness of exile %0afrom the spiritual does man carry out the work of his inner correction). %0a%0aIt is known that the end of correction does not bring anything new or that %0awas previously unknown. Rather, all the MAN and MAD, along with all degrees %0aand Zivugim that have emerged consecutively during the 6,000 years will merge %0ainto one degree and become corrected with the help of the Light of Atik. %0a%0aThe bride will then enter her Huppah, and THE CREATOR WILL ASK %0aABOUT EVERYONE, about every man who had even once raised MAN for the %0aSupernal, final Zivug. For the Creator waits for all the small Zivugim to assemble, %0aas though asking about and waiting for each of them. And when they've %0agathered, a great Zivug will unfold, called RAV PAALIM U MEKABTZIEL (HE %0aWHO BLESSES AND ADORNS HER). And when all the creatures are blessed %0aand adorned together, correction comes to an end. This is referred to as "the %0aadornment of the bride's crown." %0a%0a126. This is why Rabbi Shimon and all of his friends stayed up that night, %0aand each of them renewed the Torah again and again. Rabbi Shimon was %0ajoyous, and so were his friends. Rabbi Shimon said to them: "My sons, how %0ablessed is your lot, for it is you who shall accompany the Bride tomorrow %0ato the Huppah, for all those who correct Her and rejoice in Her this night %0ashall have their names recorded in the Book of Remembrance. And the %0aCreator shall bless them with seventy blessings and adornments of crowns %0aof the Upper World." %0a%0a%0a%0a284 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Book of Remembrance, mentioned by the prophet (Malachi, 3:15): "You %0awill say, 'How futile it is to serve the Creator! When we carried out the Creator's %0awill, and walked heavy-hearted before Him— what is the use of it all? And now %0awe regard the wicked as blessed: they have settled in their wickedness, tried the %0aCreator, and were liberated.' Then those who feared the Creator spoke with %0aeach other, and the Creator hearkened and heard, and a Book of Remembrance %0awas recorded before Him for those who fear the Creator and honor His Name. %0a'They shall become chosen for Me on the day that I shall determine, and I shall %0aspare them, as a man spares his own son, who serves him.'" %0a%0aBut how can we understand that when they spoke ill of the Creator, %0athey referred to fear of the Creator, as the prophet says? Moreover, they were %0ainscribed in the Book of Remembrance as those who "feared the Creator and %0ahonored His Name?" %0a%0aThe thing is that at the end of correction, when the great general Zivug %0aof AtiJc manifests, great Light will be revealed in all the worlds, and in this %0aLight everyone will return to the Creator in absolute love. The Talmud (Yoma, %0a86:2, "Introduction to the Study of the Ten Sefirot") says: "He who attains the %0arepentance from love shall have his sins turned to merits." %0a%0aHere, the prophet refers to the sinners claiming the futility of spiritual %0awork: on the great day of the end of correction, when the Light of repentance %0afrom love shall shine, all the most malicious and deliberate, worst imaginable %0asins, will turn to merits, and their words shall be deemed not slight, but fear %0aof the Creator. %0a%0aTherefore, all the sins, as well as all the good deeds, are recorded before the %0aCreator, for He will need them on that great day of His miracle: all the merits %0agather and complete the Kli, which receives the Light necessary for the final %0acorrection. Hence, it is said that the Creator shall record the names of those %0awho fear Him in the Book of Remembrance, for He will need them on that day %0ato complete the common Partzuf. This is exactly what the prophet says: those %0awho remain shall be close to the Creator, like sons who served Him. %0a%0aIt is therefore said that everyone and everything will be recorded in the %0aBook of Remembrance, even the sins. However, The Creator will record them %0aas though they are merits, as though they served Him. These are the words of %0athe prophet. %0a%0aThe number seventy signifies the Light of Hochma, GAR, adornment, a %0acrown, and the Light of Hassadim is called "a blessing," for the world was created %0awith the letter Bet (blessing), as it is written: "The world was built by mercy" %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Night of the Bride %0a%0a%0a%0a285 %0a%0a%0a%0a(Tehilim, 89:3), which is VAK. But at the end of correction, the Light of Hassadim %0awill also be like seventy crowns, like the Light of Hochma, for MA and BON will %0aascend to AB and SAG. Therefore, The Zohar says that the Creator will bless %0athem with seventy blessings and adornments of crowns of the Upper World. %0a%0a127. Rabbi Shimon opened and said, "The Heavens declare the Creator's %0agreatness. I have already explained this, but when the bride awakens to enter %0athe Huppah on the following day, with all the friends who rejoiced with her %0athrough that night, she rejoices with them, corrects herself and shines with %0aher adornments." %0a%0a128. And on the following day, a multitude of masses, hosts, and legions %0ajoin her. And she, together with all these masses, hosts and legions, awaits %0aall those who corrected her by studying the Torah on that night. This is so %0abecause Zeir Anpin unites with Malchut, and she sees her husband, and %0ait is said: "The Heavens declare the Creator's greatness." "The Heavens" %0aalludes to the Bridegroom (ZA), who enters the Huppah. "The Heavens %0adeclare," i.e., shine, like the luminescence of a sapphire, upon the entire %0aMalchut, from end to end. %0a%0aThe day of the end of correction is called "tomorrow," as it is written in %0athe Talmud: "Do today, and receive the reward tomorrow" (Eruvin, 22:1). The %0amasses are the worldly masses who do not serve the Creator, the hosts are those %0awho serve the Creator, and the legions are chariots of warriors in armor— the %0aSupernal groups of angels that accompany the souls, as it is said: "For He bid %0aHis angels to guard over you on all your paths" (Tehilim, 91:11). Just as the %0aCreator waits for everyone, as was previously stated, so does the Shechina. %0a%0a"Heavens" is the bridegroom entering the Huppah— the state of the end of %0acorrection, of which it is written: "And the light of the moon (Malchut) shall %0abe as the light of the sun (ZA)" (Yeshayahu, 30:26). The Creator is called the %0a"Heavens," and at the end of correction He is referred to as the "bridegroom," %0aas it is said: "Just as a bridegroom rejoices over his bride, so shall your Creator %0arejoice over you." (Yeshayahu, 62:5). %0a%0aWherever it is said that the Creator descends, it indicates His strictness %0aand judgment, for it speaks of diminishing His greatness in the eyes of the %0alower ones, as it is said: "His might and greatness are in His place." But at the %0aend of correction, when all sins turn to merits, for it will become clear that all %0athe spiritual descents were nothing other than spiritual ascents, the Creator %0abecomes the "bridegroom" and the Shechina becomes his "bride." %0a%0a%0a%0a286 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Hebrew word for "bride" is Kalah, as in the words KalatMoshe (Bamidbar, %0a7), which describes the completion of the altar. Hence, in the Torah, the word %0aKalah signifies the end of construction. The Hebrew word for "bridegroom" %0ais Hatan, and it signifies the descent along spiritual degrees, as it is said in the %0aTalmud: "Descends the steps" (Yevamot, 63:1). However, this descent is greater %0athan all the previous ascents, for it takes place on the way towards the bride at %0athe moment of the end of correction. %0a%0aThe Huppah represents the total of all the Returning Light received on the %0aMAN raised by the righteous in all the Zivugim at all the times during the 6,000 %0ayears. This is because now they have all gathered into one great Returning Light, %0arising and soaring over the Creator and the Shechina, over the bridegroom and %0ahis bride, like a Huppah— wedding canopy. %0a%0aIn this state, the righteous are called "Sons of the Huppah," for each of %0athem has a part in this Huppah, to the extent of the MAN they raise to the %0ascreen of Malchut, which evoked, produced the Returning Light, corresponding %0ain magnitude to this MAN. At the end of correction, the Creator is called Hatan %0a(bridegroom), for He Nechit Darga— descends from His degree to his bride, and %0aenters the Huppah. %0a%0aAt this time (in this state), the Heavens say— this is a great Zivug of the future, %0aas the Talmud says: "The wife speaks to her husband" (Berachot, 3:1). The word %0a"speaks" (Mesaperet) implies a Zivug, and is derived from Sapir (sapphire), the %0aname of the Shechina, as it is said in the Torah, "...and under His feet— like a %0apavement of sapphire" (Shemot, 24:10). %0a%0aTHE LUMINESCENT SAPPHIRE is the Returning Light, ascending from %0abelow upwards. LUMINESCENT, LIKE LUMINESCENCE— The Returning %0aLight, LUMINESCENT is equivalent to the Direct Light, LUMINESCENCE. %0aThis great Zivug gathers all of the Returning Light from all the Zivugim made %0aduring the 6,000 years, and the Direct Light will shine in it, as it is said, FROM %0aEND TO END. %0a%0a129. The Creator's glory = EL— is the bride, Malchut, called EL, as it is %0awritten: "EL rages each day." She is called EL on all the days of the year. And %0anow, on the holiday of Shavuot, when she already entered the Huppah, she %0ais called GREATNESS and she is called EL, greatest of the great, luminescent %0aout of the luminescent, dominion over dominions. %0a%0aEl is the name of great mercy. Yet, here it says: "El rages each day," which is %0acontrary to mercy. The Torah says: "And there shall be evening, and there shall %0abe morning, one day." The Shechina is a small star, the Moon, which reigns at %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Night of the Bride %0a%0a%0a%0a287 %0a%0a%0a%0anight. It is called "fear of Heaven," for it is the property of the righteous, who %0amust raise MAN through their aspiration to be corrected, thereby evoking the %0aReturning Light to descend on Malchut from Above and correct her. %0a%0aIt is therefore written: "The Creator hath made it so man would fear Him" %0a(Kohelet, 3:14). This is so because it is impossible to raise the MAN without fear. %0aThe absence of fear of the Creator is referred to as Malchut's reign at night, in %0athe state of darkness. In the absence of Light, all the restrictions and suffering %0aare revealed, as they are opposite to the property of day, mercy. Thus, fear of the %0aCreator emerges; were it not for this fear, the property of morning and day could %0anot be revealed. %0a%0aSo it is written: "And there shall be evening, and there shall be morning, %0aone day." Night also enters morning, for without a night, there would be no %0amorning, and one cannot do without night. It is hence written that EL RAGES %0aEACH DAY. After all, the property of mercy, called EL, is revealed only with the %0ahelp of the night, through the property of RAGE. Hence, this property is also %0aregarded as mercy; and consequently, the Shechina is called EL. %0a%0aThis is why it is said that the CREATOR'S GREATNESS = EL-IS THE %0aBRIDE, MALCHUT, CALLED EL, for it is impossible to achieve the state of %0a"day" without the state of "night." So it is in each of the six days of creation, of %0awhich it is said: "And there shall be evening, and there shall be morning, one %0aday." We see that the night is included in the name "day." And just as they are %0aall called the six DAYS of creation, the 6,000 years are called "night" in the %0aproperty of mercy. %0a%0aAnd in the great Zivug at the end of correction, a day shall come; the light of %0athe moon will become like that of the sun, as the prophet said (Zachariah, 14:7): %0a"It shall come to pass, that at evening time there shall be light." This will cause %0athe degrees of Malchut to increase twofold, for even during the 6,000 years, the %0alight of the moon was according to the aforesaid, "And there shall be evening, %0aand there shall be morning." %0a%0aAnd at the end of correction, when the moon becomes like the sun (ZA), %0athe moon will be twice as great as before, as it will become greatness itself, for %0aits greatness will equal that of ZA, of which The Zohar says: THE GREATEST %0aOF THE GREAT, DOMINION OVER DOMINIONS. Although it merged %0awith the light of the morning during the 6,000 years, as it is said, "And there %0ashall be evening, and there shall be morning, one day," now that it is as big %0aas the sun (ZA), it becomes Light, itself, LUMINESCENT OUT OF THE %0a%0a%0a%0a288 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aLUMINESCENT. Previously, its Light was solely the result of the inclusion of %0athe properties of Higher Sefirot into it. %0a%0aAlso, DOMINION OVER DOMINIONS, for during the 6,000 years, its %0areign was that of a small star, reigning only at night. Now, however, it also reigns %0aduring the day, for it is as big as the sun. %0a%0a130. The hour when the Heaven (ZA) enters the Huppah and shines upon %0aMalcHwt, all of her friends, who corrected her by studying the Torah, are %0aknown by their names, as it is said: "The Heavens declare the work of His %0ahands." "The work of His hands" refers to the members of this covenant, %0acalled "the work of His hands." As you say: "Confirm for us the work of our %0ahands," which is the mark of the covenant, imprinted on man's body. %0a%0a"Friends" are those who keep the Torah, which includes both good and %0aevil deeds, even those parts of them that are still evil and uncorrected; EACH %0aIS KNOWN BY A NAME (his corrected part), as it is said: THE HEAVENS %0aDECLARE THE WORK OF HIS HANDS. "Heavens" is the Book of Remem- %0abrance, which constitutes the Light of the great Zivug that leads to repentance %0a(correction) out of love, when sins become merits (Talmud, Yoma, 86:2). %0a%0aAnd even those who were speaking ill things, it is said about them: "Then %0athey shall impart their fear of the Creator upon one another" (item 126). %0aTherefore, the action defined as "upholding the Torah," which includes both %0agood (for the worthy) and evil (for the unworthy), now becomes completely %0agood and holy. And it turns into THE WORK OF HIS HANDS-the Creator's %0aactions, for THE HEAVENS SPEAK even of the unworthy. It turns out that all %0athe friends have performed only good deeds and carried out holy work, for they %0awould all correct Malchut, and ALL ARE KNOWN BY THEIR NAMES. %0a%0aIt is therefore said: CONFIRM FOR US THE WORK OF OUR HANDS %0a(Tehilim, 90:17). However, it is unclear whose hands are meant: His or ours? Only %0aone thing is meant here— that the covenant is referred to as "the work of our hands," %0afor its confirmation is Yesod (Yesod is not only the name of a Sefira, it also means %0a"basis," "foundation" in Hebrew), the foundation of the entire construction. %0a%0aThe correction of Yesod is Brit Milah (circumcision). Hence, it is said that %0athe existence of the covenant is called "the work of our hands," for we separate %0athe Orlah (foreskin) from Yesod through the work of our hands. But this only %0aconcerns the period up to the end of correction. And at the end of correction, %0aTHE WORK OF HIS HANDS will be revealed. In other words, the Creator %0aHimself will detach the Orlah from us, and THE HEAVENS DECLARE THE %0aWORK OF HIS HANDS. But until that state comes, we are entrusted with the %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Night of the Bride %0a%0a%0a%0a289 %0a%0a%0a%0acorrection of the circumcision. Therefore, we ask: CONFIRM FOR US THE %0aWORK OF OUR HANDS. %0a%0a131. Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba then said as follows: "Do not let your mouth cause %0ayour body to sin," i.e., one must not allow his mouth to get close to evil and be %0athe cause of sin for the sacred flesh, which bears the mark of the holy covenant %0awith the Creator. If he does so, he shall be dragged to hell. And the ruler of %0ahell, called Domeh, stands at the gates of hell with hundreds of thousands of %0aangels, but he is forbidden to approach those who have kept the holy covenant %0ain this world. %0a%0aThere is a warning here: let each man be careful of what he utters, so that %0ahis prayer is pure when he raises MAN with the help of the Torah and Mitzvot. %0aIf the impure force clings to his prayer, it will receive his MAN. As a result, %0aman will develop a grudge against the Creator and foreign thoughts, thereby %0acausing the Orlah to once again cling to the holy covenant. Consequently, %0ahis holy soul will fall into the captivity of the impure forces, and they will %0adrag it to hell. This is similar to what Rabbi Elazar said about falling into %0aLilit's hands (item 68). %0a%0aTHE SACRED FLESH, WHICH BEARS THE MARK OF THE HOLY %0aCOVENANT alludes to the holy soul guarded by the holy covenant, as it is said: %0a"From my flesh I shall see the Creator," i.e., from my nature, my properties. Yet, %0adoubts evoke the return of the impure force of the Orlah. It touches the holy %0acovenant, and the Divine soul is instantly driven away. Hence, "The Tree cried %0aout: Sinner, do not touch me," for this Tree is Yesod, Ateret Yesod (foreskin— the %0avery essence of creation, egoism), the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. %0a%0aDOMEH, THE RULER OF HELL— DOMEH is derived from Dmamah- %0alifelessness, for he robs man of his soul and leaves him lifeless. This is the angel %0athat fills man's heart with doubts regarding the Creator's greatness, and creates %0awithin him a sinful desire to perceive His plans as though they were plans of one %0aborn of a woman, i.e., as though they were of this world. And since he likens the %0aCreator's thoughts in man's perception to those of man, he is named so (Domeh %0aalso means likeness, similarity). %0a%0aAt first, man understands that the Creator's thoughts and ways are different %0afrom ours, for the created mind can grasp neither Him nor His thoughts nor %0aHis governance, as our mind is inferior to His. But, through sin, the angel %0aDomeh plants a silly spirit within man, which forces him to say that the mind %0aof one born of a woman is similar to the Creator's. This leaves man open to %0adoubts, which DRAG HIM TO HELL. %0a%0a%0a%0a290 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aTherefore, the power of the angel Domeh is in his name, as it is said: "Who %0ais as mighty as You, who is LIKE You, the King that kills and resurrects?" This %0aindicates that the connection with the one who is LIKE him leads to death, %0awhereas in the realization that there is none like Him, man finds life. %0a%0aHowever, the doubts and thoughts that man receives from the angel Domeh %0aare countless, as The Zohar says, HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF ANGELS %0aARE WITH HIM, and they are all standing at the gates of hell, through which %0aman is dragged there, though the gates themselves are not yet considered hell. %0a%0aBUT HE (THE ANGEL) IS FORBIDDEN TO APPROACH THOSE %0aWHO HAVE KEPT THE HOLY COVENANT IN THIS WORLD. And even if %0aone did not fully keep (observe) the covenant, and there is still good and evil in %0ahis deeds, he is nonetheless regarded as one who has kept the holy covenant. So, %0aunless one comes to doubt, the angel Domeh is forbidden to drag him to hell. %0a%0a132. When this happened to King David, fear enveloped him. Right then, %0aDomeh ascended before the Creator, and said: "Master of the world, it says in %0athe To rah (Vayikra, 20:10): 'And the man that commits adultery with another %0aman's wife...' David broke his covenant, is it not so?" The Creator replied to %0ahim: "David is righteous, and his holy covenant remains pure, for it is known %0ato Me that Bat Sheva was destined for him since the creation of the world." %0a%0aAlthough David committed no sin, as the Talmud explains (Shabbat, 56: 1) that %0ahe who says that David sinned is wrong, he was enveloped with fear nonetheless, %0aas if he really had sinned, for Domeh cited the Torah in his complaint. %0a%0aHowever, Bat Sheva had been destined for David since the creation of the %0aworld (Talmud, Sanhedrin, 107:1); thus, he did not violate his covenant. Yet, if Bat %0aSheva had been destined for David, why was she first married to Uriah? After all, %0aa wife is half of her husband's body. And if she is half of David's body, how could %0aUriah have taken her, if there is nothing in him that corresponds with her? %0a%0aThe fact is that Bat Sheva is David's true Nukva (female) from the day of the %0acreation of the world, for David is the male part of Malchut, while Bat Sheva %0ais the Nukva in Malchut. But since, as the world was being created, Malchut %0aascended to Bina to receive the property of mercy (bestowal) from her, Bat Sheva, %0atoo, required this correction in GAR. Without it she could not have given birth %0ato the soul of King Solomon. %0a%0aAnd Uriah the Hittite was an exalted soul, the properties of GAR, wherefrom %0athe name "Uriah," which consists of Ur = Ohr (Light) and i(a)h = i (Yod) + h (Hey) = %0athe first two letters of the Creator's Name HaVaYaH, is derived. In other words, %0aUriah signifies "the Creator's Light." And the fact that his name contains only %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Night of the Bride %0a%0a%0a%0a291 %0a%0a%0a%0athe first two letters Yod-Hey = Hochma-Bina, and lacks the last two letters Vav- %0aHey = ZA-Malchut indicates that his Light is the Light of GAR. Therefore, to %0acorrect Bat Sheva in the property of mercy, she was joined with Uriah. As a %0aresult, she became fit for queenship, and became the Queen of Israel. %0a%0a133. Domeh said to Him: "Master of the World, what is revealed to You is %0aconcealed from him." The Creator answered: "Whatever David did was done %0awith My permission. For no man goes to war without first giving his wife a get %0a(document of divorce)." Domeh then said: "But if this is so, David should have %0awaited three months, which he did not." The Creator replied: "This extension %0ais only necessary to make certain that the woman is not pregnant from her %0aprevious husband. But it is known to Me that Uriah never went near her, for %0aMy Name is imprinted in him as testimony. Indeed, Uriah is Ohr'lah, the %0aCreator's Light, though it is written Uriahu = Ohr + i + a + hu (Yod-Hey-Vav), %0awithout the last Hey, MalcHut, which proves that he did not use Malcfutt." %0a%0aThe letters Yod-Hey in Uriah's name (Aleph-Reish-Yod-Hey) indicate that he %0ahad never touched Bat Sheva. This is because Uriah refers to GAR without %0aVAK. And The Zohar emphasizes that whenever VAK is used, the name Uriahu %0ais applied. However, it is written here that Uriah was Bat Sheva's first husband, %0ameaning that he had nothing of VAK in him, but only GAR— the Light of Hochma %0awithout the Light of Hassadim, for Vav signifies Hassadim. This is why he could %0anot come near Bath Sheba. %0a%0a134. Domeh said to Him: "Master of the World, this is exactly what I have %0asaid: if You knew that Uriah had never laid with her, then who revealed it to %0aDavid? He should have waited three months. And if You will say that David %0aknew that Uriah had never laid with her, why did he send Uriah to his wife, %0asaying: 'Go down to your house, and wash your feet?'" %0a%0aUsually the readers of the To rah give this example of "a love triangle %0aevidence of King David's less than exalted qualities and of the inconsistent %0athe Creator's judgment— how He forgave David for "killing" Uriah, and so forth. %0aWe must remember that the Torah speaks only of the spiritual worlds and their %0alaws, which have no obvious consequences in our world. There is a cause-and- %0aeffect connection: whatever occurs in our world is a result of a Higher cause, but %0ano way is it vice versa, i.e., whatever is described in the Upper World does not %0asarily need to manifest in ours. To consider the Torah a narrative abo %0arelegates the Torah of the world of Atzilut, the Creator's holy na: %0athe Creator's Light, to the lowest level of creation, which is strictly forbid %0a"Do not make an idol for yourself." %0a%0a%0a%0ale" as %0aicy of %0a%0a%0a%0a%0aibout %0aim e S , %0aIden: %0a%0a%0a%0a292 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0a135. He replied to him: "Of course, David did not know, but he waited more %0athan three months, as four months had passed." As we have learned, on the %0a15 th day of Nissan, David ordered all the people of Israel to prepare for war, %0aYoav— on seventh day of Nissan. They conquered the lands of Moav and %0aremained there for four months, until he went to Bat Sheva in the month %0aof Elul. And on Yom Kippur, the Creator forgave him his sin. But there are %0athose who say that David dispatched his orders on the seventh day of Adar, %0athe troops assembled on the 15 th day of lyar, he went to Bat Sheva on the %0a15 th day of Elul, and on Yom Kippur the Creator forgave him and spared him %0afrom death at the hands of the angel Domeh. %0a%0aDomeh is in charge of adultery. And since David was forgiven on the Day of %0aAtonement, he thereby escaped death at the hands of Domeh. However, death %0awas a consequence of Uriah's death at the hands of Amon's sons, as is recorded %0ain the book of Kings (Melachim, 1, 15:5), "For David did that which was right in %0athe eyes of the Lord, and turned not aside from anything that He commanded %0ahim all the days of his life, save only in the matter of Uriah the Hittite." %0a%0a136. Domeh said: "Master of the World, I have nonetheless one claim %0aagainst him: why did he open his mouth and say: 'The Lord is righteous, %0afor a mortal does so,' thus condemning himself to death. Hence, I have the %0apower to bring death upon him." The Creator replied to him: "You are %0anot allowed to bring death upon him, for he has repented and confessed: 'I %0ahave sinned before the Creator,' even though he did not sin. But he did sin %0ain one matter— the killing of Uriah. I have recorded his punishment, and %0ahe had received it." Then Domeh immediately gave up his complaints, and %0areturned, despondent, to his place. %0a%0aThe last letter Hey in the name HaVaYaH has two points— restriction %0a(strictness) and mercy. And all the corrections of Malchut with the help of the %0acovenant (circumcision) are intended to conceal strictness and reveal mercy. %0aThen, the Creator's name descends into Malchut. Even though Malchut exists %0athere under the ban of the first restriction (strictness and judgment), and all %0athe impure forces cling onto her, this point is nonetheless concealed, and only %0aBina's property of mercy is revealed. Thus, the impure forces-desires, which are %0aforeign to holiness and spirituality, are powerless and cannot cling to her. %0a%0aTo violate the covenant means to reveal the strictness and judgment in %0aMalchut (the letter Hey). As a result, the impure forces immediately cling to her, for %0athis is their property— a part of them. The holy soul, the Creator's name, thereby %0adisappears at once, as it is written (lyov, 4:9): "By the breath of God they perish." %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Night of the Bride %0a%0a%0a%0a293 %0a%0a%0a%0aDavid himself is the part of Malchut related to Malchut's property of mercy. %0aHence, he requires special care so as to prevent Malchut's property of strictness %0afrom being revealed in him. For he who reveals the property of strictness and %0aviolates the covenant with the Creator, surrenders himself to the impure forces, %0awhich condemn him to death. This is because the property of strictness reveals %0aitself within him before the impure force (the angel Domeh), who wished to %0acling to David's soul and drag it to hell. %0a%0aAlthough he was innocent, David begged the Creator's forgiveness for adultery, %0aand received it. But with regard to David sending Uriah to his death, Domeh had %0ano right to ask the Creator for punishment, as he is only in charge of adultery. %0a%0a137. And David said to this: "Were it not for the Creator's help, Domeh had %0anearly claimed my soul." "Were it not for the Creator's help" means "had the %0aCreator not been my guard and guide against the angel Domeh." "Nearly" %0ameans that only the distance as thin as a thread remained for Domeh to drag %0amy soul to hell. %0a%0aDavid is Malchut, of whom it is written (Mishley, 5:5): "Her feet descend to %0adeath," for she is the end, conclusion of holiness (the spiritual). The impure %0aforces originate in Malchut, and she sustains them, as it is said (Tehilim, 103:19): %0a"His kingdom rules over all." %0a%0aHowever, when Malchut exists in her corrected property of mercy (item 122), %0ashe is defined as consisting of two points: her own point of judgment and the %0apoint of mercy that she received from Bina. Her point of judgment is concealed, %0awhile the point of mercy is revealed. And thanks to this correction, all that the %0aimpure forces can get from Malchut is a Ner Dakik (tiny luminescence), which %0aonly sustains their existence, but does not allow for their spreading. %0a%0aNer Dakik, the source of existence for the impure forces, is also known as %0aHoteh Dakik, a small sin, the root of sins, as it is written (Talmud, Sukkah, 52:1): %0a"Initially, the impure force seems as thin as a spider web, but then grows as %0athick as a shaft." And it is called small (Dakik), for judgment and restrictions are %0aconcealed within the property (point) of mercy. %0a%0aHowever, he who violates the covenant causes the point of judgment in %0aMalchut to be revealed. As a result, the impure forces cling to Malchut and draw %0amuch Light from her, thus receiving the strength to spread and expand. And he %0awho does so is said to be forsaking his own soul, as it is written: "By the breath %0aof God they perish" (lyov, 4:9). %0a%0aAnd when he merits returning to the Creator, he returns and corrects %0aMalchut with the property of mercy. This is why this process is called Teshuva %0a%0a%0a%0a294 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0a(return), from the word of Tashuv (to return) + "A," where "A" (Hey) designates %0athe Creator. In other words, it is the return to the property of mercy, whereas %0athe property of judgment goes back to being concealed in the property of mercy, %0alike a small candle, and nothing more. %0a%0aIt is therefore written: WERE IT NOT FOR THE CREATOR'S HELP, %0areferring to His acceptance of my return and repelling the angel Domeh by %0abringing Malchut back to her place (to the property) of mercy, reducing the %0aproperty of judgment to a mere small candle, a hair's-breadth fire, whose LIGHT %0aSEPARATES ME FROM THE IMPURE FORCE. %0a%0aThis is that minimal Light that must always remain between Malchut and %0athe impure force, so as to allow Malchut to exist and be sustained by this small %0aLight, called "small sin," so small that DOMEH WOULD NOT DRAG MY %0aSOUL TO HELL FOR IT. %0a%0aIt is precisely the magnitude of this Light that saved me from the hands %0aof Domeh, for had the property of judgment not returned to Malchut in the %0ameasure of a small sin, I would have fallen into the hands of Domeh. %0a%0a138. Therefore, man should be careful not to say what David said, for one %0acannot say to the angel Domeh that "It was an error" (Kohelet, 5:5), as it was %0awith David, when the Creator won the dispute against Domeh. "Why should %0athe Creator be angry over your word" (Kohelet, 5:5), i.e., for what you have %0asaid. "Destroyed the work of your hands" (Kohelet, 5:5) i.e., the sacred flesh, %0athe holy covenant, which you have broken, and are therefore to be dragged to %0ahell by the angel Domeh. %0a%0aThere are two ways to return to the Creator ("Introduction to the Study of %0athe Ten Sefirot," items 45, 59, 64; Talmud, Yoma, 86:2): %0a%0a1) Repentance out of fear, when intentional sins become unintentional, %0a%0a2) Repentance out of love, when intentional sins become merits. %0a%0aBefore the end of correction, when the forces of strictness, restriction, and %0ajudgment are still needed in the world, as it is written (Kohelet, 3:14), "The %0aCreator hath so made it that man should fear Him," Malchut must sustain the %0aexistence of the impure forces as Ner Dakik, so they will not disappear from %0athe world. %0a%0aTherefore, at such a time (in this state), Malchut's corrections are made in %0atwo points: mercy and judgment. However, judgment is concealed, while mercy %0aacts openly. This is why the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil is feared: if %0aman is worthy— it is good, if not— it is evil (items 120-124). %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Night of the Bride %0a%0a%0a%0a295 %0a%0a%0a%0aTherefore, DURING THE 6,000 YEARS, WE RETURN TO THE %0aCREATOR ONLY OUT OF FEAR, which causes our intentional sins to turn %0ainto unintentional ones— errors. As a result of our repentance, we bring Malchut %0aback to the property of mercy. But strictness and judgment are concealed in her %0ato the extent of a small candle (small sin), since Malchut must still remain in the %0aproperty of fear. Hence, this return is called "the return out of fear." %0a%0aThe small sin that must remain is also called "unintentional sin," an "error," %0aa "mistake," for it is not regarded as a sin in and of itself. Rather, it only leads %0aman to commit an unintentional sin. Man sins intentionally only after having %0afirst committed an unintentional sin: he committed something unintentionally, %0abut it turned out that he has sinned. %0a%0aThus, this small sin remains in Malchut, but although it remains, it is not %0areally considered a sin. Yet, through this concealed judgment and strictness %0awe come to intentional sins. This is why it is said: "Initially, it is as a hair's- %0abreadth," i.e., like a small sin. But then, unless we properly guard our covenant, %0ait "becomes as thick as a shaft," as the property of strictness and judgment %0abecomes revealed in Malchut. %0a%0aIt is hence said that Domeh stands at the gates of hell, as the power of a %0asmall sin is only an entrance, for it is said that it looks as thin as a spider web. %0aTherefore, our repentance is called "forgiven sins," which turn into unintentional %0aerrors, as though they were mistakes. For a small sin remains, which is capable %0aof leading us to intentional sins. %0a%0aAll this refers to the repentance out of fear, whereas the second kind is the %0arepentance out of love, when intentional sins turn to merits (item 126). %0a%0aTherefore, MAN SHOULD BE CAREFUL NOT TO SAY WHAT DAVID %0aSAID, i.e., not to utter the word that causes the property of judgment in Malchut %0ato be revealed (as David had done). FOR ONE CANNOT SAY TO THE ANGEL %0aDOMEH THAT IT WAS AN ERROR, for he is unsure as to whether he can %0areturn to the Creator right away, so that his sin would be forgiven and made %0aunintentional, AS IT WAS WITH DAVID, WHEN THE CREATOR WON %0aTHE DISPUTE AGAINST DOMEH. %0a%0aIt happened with David because throughout his life all of his actions before %0athe Creator were pure, he had committed no crimes, and the only exception was %0ahis act toward Uriah. Hence, the Creator became his defender, and helped him %0areturn to Him at once, and his sin was turned into an error, as it is said in The %0aZohar (item 137): WERE IT NOT FOR THE CREATOR'S HELP, DOMEH %0a%0a%0a%0a296 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aHAD NEARLY CLAIMED MY SOUL. But other people should fear this angel, %0afor an unintentional sin may lead them to hell at the hands of Domeh. %0a%0aDESTROYED THE WORK OF YOUR HANDS, THE SACRED FLESH, %0aTHE HOLY COVENANT, WHICH YOU HAVE VIOLATED, AND ARE %0aTHEREFORE TO BE DRAGGED TO HELL BY THE ANGEL DOMEH. %0aThe correction in us called "the holy covenant" is regarded as "the work of %0aour hands," as it is written: "Confirm the work of our hands." The holy soul %0ais called the sacred flesh, as it is said, "Out of my flesh shall I see the Creator" %0a(lyov, 19:26) (item 131). Because of the revelation of the property of strictness %0aand judgment in Malchut, the correction of the covenant was corrupted, and %0aDomeh drags the soul to hell. %0a%0aTherefore, THE HEAVENS DECLARE THE WORK OF HIS HANDS %0a(item 130). In the end of correction, the Heavens will declare the work of His %0ahands, as the reward for all these corrections will be revealed. It will become %0aclear that this was THE WORK OF HIS HANDS, and NOT OURS', and THE %0aHEAVENS DECLARE this. And the great Zivug RAV PAALIM U MEKABTZIEL %0awill be made on these actions (corrections) (item 92). DECLARE refers to the %0aLight's descent from Above. %0a%0aKnow that this is the only difference in our world before and after the end of %0acorrection. Before the end of correction, Malchut is called the Tree of Knowledge %0aof Good and Evil, for Malchut is the revelation of the Creator's governance over %0athis world. And until people achieve the state where they can receive His Light %0a(as He conceived and prepared for everyone back at the Thought of Creation), %0athe world will be ruled by good and evil, by reward and punishment. %0a%0aThe reason for this is that our Kelim de Kabbalah (vessels of reception) are %0aimpure, stained by egoism, which (i) prevents the Creator's Light from filling %0atheses desires, and (ii) separates us from the Creator. And the infinite goodness %0athat He has prepared for us may only be received in altruistic desires, for these %0adelights are not limited by the bounds of creation, like egoistic pleasures, in %0awhich fulfillment instantly douses the pleasure. %0a%0aHence, it is written: "The Creator hath made everything for His own glory" %0a(Mishley, 16:4), i.e., all the deeds in the world were initially created by Him %0aso that we could please Him. Therefore, people in our world are engaged in %0athings that are totally opposite from what they should be doing, according to the %0apurpose of their creation. After all, the Creator clearly states that He created the %0aworld for Himself: "I have created it for My glory" (Yeshayahu, 43:7). %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Night of the Bride %0a%0a%0a%0a297 %0a%0a%0a%0a%0aYet, we claim the exact opposite— that the whole world was created for us, %0aand we desire to swallow it whole, for our own pleasure, satisfaction, indulgence, %0aand exaltation. So it is no surprise we are unworthy of receiving the Creator's %0aperfect goodness. And thus He rules over us through good and evil, in the %0aform of reward and punishment, for one depends on the other: reward and %0apunishment give rise to good and evil. %0a%0aBecause we use our desires to receive (pleasure), thus becoming opposite %0am the Creator, we perceive His governance towards us as evil. This stems fn %0aat man cannot perceive obvious evil from the Creator, as this w %0adermine the creatures' perception of the great and perfect Creator, fo %0aone cannot create evil. %0a%0aTherefore, to the extent that man feels bad and evil, and denies the Divine %0aProvidence, a veil immediately falls over him, and the sensation of the Creator's %0aexistence disappears. This is the worst punishment in the world! %0a%0aHence, the sensation of good and evil in the Creator's governance gives us %0aa feeling of reward and punishment. This is because he who exerts efforts not to %0alose faith in the Creator's existence and governance, even if he tastes evil in His %0agovernance, is rewarded with finding strength to not lose faith in the governance %0aand good purpose of the Creator's "evil" influence. But if he had not yet merited %0athe opportunity to exert efforts in believing that the Creator pursues a definite %0apurpose by sending him unpleasant sensations, he is punished with remoteness %0afrom faith in the Creator and the sensation of His existence. %0a%0aTherefore, although He has done, is doing, and will do all the deeds in the %0aworld, it remains semi-concealed from those who perceive both good and evil. %0aFor when they perceive evil, the impure force is allowed to conceal the Creator's %0agovernance and faith in Him. Thus, man suffers the worst punishment in the %0aworld— the sensation of detachment from the Creator— and becomes filled with %0adoubts and denial of the Creator's existence and governance. And when he %0areturns to the Creator, he receives a corresponding reward, and is able to unite %0awith Him once again. %0a%0aBut through this very governance of reward and punishment, the Creator %0ahas prepared for us the opportunity to utilize this governance in order to achieve %0athe end of correction, when all people attain their corrected Kelim (desires), and %0ause them to bring pleasure to the Creator, as it is written that He has created %0a%0a%0a%0aThen the great Zivug of Atik will be revealed, we will all return to the Creator %0aout of love, all our intentional sins will turn to merits, all evil will be felt as %0a%0a%0a%0a298 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0ainfinite goodness, and His Divine Providence will be revealed in the entire %0aworld. Thus, ALL SHALL SEE that only He has done, is doing, and will do all %0athe deeds in the world, and that no one acts besides Him. After the sensation of %0aevil and punishment is turned to one of goodness and reward, and our egoistic %0adesires become altruistic, we are given the opportunity to attain the Maker, for %0awe conform to the work of His hands by blessing and exalting Him above all evil %0aand all punishments we had once suffered. %0a%0aHowever, the most important point to stress here is that until the end %0aof correction, all the corrections were considered as THE WORK OF OUR %0aHANDS. This is why we receive rewards or punishments for them. But in the %0agreat Zivug at the end of correction, it will be revealed that all the corrections %0aand all the punishments are THE WORK OF HIS HANDS. %0a%0aThus, it is said, THE HEAVENS DECLARE THE WORK OF HIS HANDS. %0aThis is because the great Zivug signifies what the Heavens will declare, that all %0athe deeds are the work of His hands, that He has done, is doing, and will do all %0athe deeds in the whole of creation. %0a%0a139. Thus, "the Heavens declare the work of His hands." These are the friends %0awho have united in the bride (Malchut) by studying the Torah on the night %0aof the holiday of Shavuot. They are all participants of the covenant with her, %0aand are called "the work of His hands." And she praises and notes each and %0aevery one of them. What is Heaven, firmament? It is the firmament, where %0athe sun, the moon, the stars, and the zodiac are located. This firmament is %0acalled the Book of Remembrance, and it declares and records them, so they %0ashall become the sons of His palace, and He will fulfill all their desires. %0a%0aYesod of Zeir Anpin, onto which a Zivug is made for the revelation of all %0athe Supernal Degrees, called the sun, the moon, the stars, and the signs of the %0azodiac, is referred to as the "firmament." All of the Supernal stars exist on the %0afirmament, called Yesod of Zeir Anpin. And everything exists thanks to it, for it %0amakes a Zivug with Nukva, called earth, and shines upon her with all these stars, %0ai.e., gives these stars to her. %0a%0aIt turns out that Malchut is smaller than the sun (ZA). But at the end of %0acorrection, the light of the moon will be as the light of the sun, and the light %0aof the sun will be seventy times greater than before— Malchut will become as %0abig as Zeir Anpin during the six days of creation. When will this be? Rabbi %0aYehuda answers: on the day when death disappears forever, and the Creator %0aand His Name are as one. %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Night of the Bride %0a%0a%0a%0a299 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Heaven or the firmament (ZA) is HaVaYaH, called "the sun." Malchut %0a(Nukva) receives from it, and is called "the moon." During the 6,000 years, %0aMalchut receives the Light from the six days of creation, but Zeir Anpin does not %0areveal that the Creator and His Name are one. Hence, the moon is smaller than %0athe sun. Its lesser size is a result of Malchut's consisting of both good and evil, %0areward and punishment. %0a%0aThere is a considerable difference between "Him" and "His Name." "His %0aName" is Malchut, where all the Zivugim, and all the states of unification and %0aseparation are accumulated. But at the end of correction, when death is said to %0adisappear forever, HaVaYaH and His Name will be one. The Name (Malchut) %0awill be like the Light of Zeir Anpin— only goodness without evil, and the private %0agovernance will be revealed in her, which means that the light of the moon will %0abecome equal to that of the sun. %0a%0aTherefore at this time (in this state), Nukva will be called "the Book of %0aRemembrance," for all human deeds are recorded in her. Yesod of Zeir Anpin is %0acalled "remembrance," for it remembers the deeds of the entire world, studies, %0aand analyzes all the creatures that receive from it. %0a%0aDuring the 6,000 years before the end of correction, the Book of %0aRemembrance exists sometimes together and sometimes separately. But at the %0aend of correction, these two degrees will merge into one, and Malchut herself %0awill be called "the Book of Remembrance," when ZA and Malchut become a %0asingle whole, for Malchut's Light will equal that of ZA. %0a%0aTherefore, the firmament is a place where the sun, the moon, the stars, %0aand the signs of the zodiac are located. The firmament is Yesod of ZA, which %0aemanates all the Light of the world and sustains all existence. It passes the Light %0aonto Malchut when she is smaller than it, and the state, "He and His Name are %0aone" has not yet been achieved. And at the end of correction, it will be exactly %0alike Malchut, who is hence called the Book of Remembrance. %0a%0aThus, when Malchut receives all the properties of Zeir Anpin (the firmament, %0acalled "Remembrance"), she will become the Book of Remembrance, i.e., she %0aand the firmament will be one. %0a%0a140. Day after day brings Omer— a sheaf. The holy day out of those days %0a(Sefirot) of the King (Zeir Anpin) praises the friends, who study the Torah %0aon the night of Shavuot. They say to each other, "Day after day shall bring %0aa sheaf," and praise it. And the words "night after night" refer to all the %0adegrees, Sefirot of Malchut, that reign in the night, praise one another by %0a%0a%0a%0a300 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aeach receiving from a friend, from another Sefira. And the state of complete %0aperfection makes them beloved friends. %0a%0aHaving explained that THE HEAVENS DECLARE THE WORK OF HIS %0aHANDS is THE BOOK OF REMEMBRANCE. The Zohar continues to clarify the %0awritings in the Book ofMalachi (3:14-16): "You have said, 'How futile it is to serve %0athe Creator! When we carried out the Creator's will, and walked heavy-hearted %0abefore Him— what is the use of it all? And now we regard the wicked as blessed: %0athey have settled in their wickedness, tried the Creator, and were liberated.' Then %0athose who feared the Creator spoke WITH EACH OTHER, and the Creator %0ahearkened and heard, and a BOOK OF REMEMBRANCE was recorded before %0aHim for those who fear the Creator (every day) and honor His (holy) name. %0aAnd they shall become chosen for Me,'— the Lord said,— 'on the day that I shall %0adetermine, and I shall spare them, as a man spares his son, who serves him,— on %0athe day that I shall work a miracle, on the day of the end of correction.'" %0a%0aBefore the end of correction, before we prepare our desires "to receive" only %0afor the Creator's sake, and not for self-gratification, Malchut is called "The Tree %0aof Knowledge of Good and Evil," for Malchut governs the world in accordance %0awith man's deeds. Inasmuch as we are not yet ready to receive all the delight that %0athe Creator prepared for us in His Thought of Creation, we have no choice but %0ato submit to Malchut's governance of good and evil. %0a%0aAnd this very governance prepares us for the eventual correction of our %0adesires to receive (Kelim de Kabbalah) into desires for bestowal (Kelim de Hashpaa), %0athus achieving the goodness and delight that He conceived to bestow upon us. %0a%0aAs was previously stated, the sensation of good and evil creates in us a %0afeeling of reward and punishment. Therefore, when one tries to retain his faith %0ain the Creator while he is feeling evil, but still continues to observe the Torah %0aand Mitzvot as he did before, he is rewarded. %0a%0aAnd if he cannot overcome this test and is distanced from the Creator, he %0abecomes filled with doubts with regard to the good governance. Alternatively, he %0astops believing that the Creator governs the world altogether, or feels resentment %0atowards the Creator in response to these unpleasant sensations. The Creator pun- %0aishes for all thoughts, just as He does for all actions (Talmud, Kidushim, 40:1). %0a%0aIt is also said that one's righteousness is of no help to him on the day of his %0asin. But sometimes man's doubts are so overpowering that he regrets even the %0agood deeds he had previously done, and says (Malachi, 3:14): "You have said, %0a'How futile it is to serve the Creator! When we carried out the Creator's will, %0aand walked heavy-hearted before Him— what is the use of it all?'" He becomes %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Night of the Bride %0a%0a%0a%0a301 %0a%0a%0a%0aa complete sinner, who regrets his righteous past (complaining that he wasted %0atime and effort instead of enjoying this world like the others!), and his doubts %0aand regrets cause him to lose all of his good deeds, as the Torah warns us: %0a"One's righteousness is of no help to him on the day of his sin." %0a%0aYet, even in this state, man can return to the Creator. However, he is said %0ato be beginning on his path anew, as though he is a newborn, for all of his past %0agood deeds are gone. %0a%0aOne should not take the aforesaid literally, even in its spiritual context, for %0ahe who works to achieve unconditional altruistic deeds constantly experiences %0adescents and ascents, is filled with doubts, and tries to overcome them. Only %0aone who advances in this manner feels that he is starting his work every time %0aanew, that he understands no more than a newborn baby. Conversely, one who %0abelongs to the masses— who works in his egoistic desires— is constantly filled with %0aself-reverence and thinks that on each new day, he adds to the previous one, and %0anothing seems to disappear. This makes his spiritual growth impossible. %0a%0aOnly one who truly ascends the spiritual degrees feels like a newborn baby %0abefore his Creator at each moment. After all, as he ascends from one degree to %0athe next, the previous state (degree) disappears, and until he attains a Higher %0aDegree, he is in total darkness and feels that he is starting from scratch, rather %0athan supplementing his assets, which is how the spiritually inanimate (Domem %0ade Kedusha) feel. %0a%0aThe governance of good and evil causes us to ascend and descend— each in %0ahis own way... Each ascent is considered a separate day (sensation of Light). As a %0aresult of the great descent that he has just undergone by regretting his past good %0adeeds, man moves into a state of ascent, as one who is born anew. %0a%0aTherefore, at each ascent, it is as though one starts over on his path to the %0aCreator. Thus, each ascent is regarded as a separate day, for there is a break (night) %0abetween these states. And each descent is hence considered a separate night. %0a%0aThis is what The Zohar tells us: DAY AFTER DAY SHALL BRING A %0aSHEAF— in each ascent we draw nearer to the Creator's greatest day (the end %0aof correction), HE PRAISED THE FRIENDS AND THEY WOULD SPEAK %0aWITH EACH OTHER. This is because through the great Zivug at the end of %0acorrection, they will all merit returning to the Creator out of love, for the desire %0a"to receive" will be completely corrected, and they will begin to receive only for %0athe Creator's sake, so as to bestow delight upon Him. %0a%0aIn this great Zivug (unity), we will reveal all the supreme goodness and %0a%0a%0a%0adelight of the Thought of Creation. And we will tl %0a%0a%0a%0ath %0a%0a%0a%0a%0a302 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aits would %0ahe direct %0a%0a%0a%0a%0alose punishments we experienced in the states of descent, which %0at and regret the efforts exerted in the Torah, all those punishments %0arrect and purify us. And now, at the end of correction, they are the %0ase for our sensation and reception of the Creator's goodness. %0a%0aHad it not been for the terrible suffering and punishments, we would not %0ahave been able to achieve the state of being filled with perfect delight. Therefore, %0aeven these intentional sins turn into merits, as it is said: DAY AFTER DAY %0aULL BRING A SHEAF— each ascent in Malchut, up to the end of correction, %0a%0aThis day is revealed by the word, which supports the Torah in all its greatness. %0aWhat is this word? When they say, "How futile it is to serve the Creator! When %0awe carried out the Creator's will, and walked heavy-hearted before Him— what %0ais the use of it all?" %0a%0aThese words brought punishments that have now become merits, for all %0athe perfection and magnificence of that great day can now be revealed thanks %0ato these very punishments of the past. Thus, those who uttered these words are %0anow regarded as those who fear the Creator and praise His Name. (And these %0awords could only have been spoken by those who made efforts to advance on %0athe Path of Truth, and felt frustrated upon receiving uncorrected egoism of a %0aHigher Degree. In other words, frustration comes only to those who truly work %0afor the Creator's sake.) %0a%0aHence, it is said about them: "The Lord said, 'On the day that I shall %0adetermine, and I shall spare them, as a man spares his son, who serves him,'" %0afor all the nights— states of descent, suffering and punishments, which sever %0atheir connection with the Creator— now become merits and good deeds. And %0athe night turns into day, darkness turns into Light, and there are no divisions %0abetween days, and all 6,000 years gather into one great day. %0a%0aAnd all the Zivugim that were made one after another, revealed the ascents %0aand the separate, consecutive degrees, have now gathered into one degree of %0aone great Zivug— Unity, which shines in the world from end to end. Hence, it %0ais written: DAY AFTER DAY SHALL BRING A SHEAF, that is, the intervals %0abetween days now become magnificent glory, for they have been turned into %0amerits. Thus, everything becomes the Creator's one glorious day! %0a%0aAnd the words "night after night" refer to all the degrees that reign in the %0anight. They praise one another, and each receives everything that man feels as %0asuffering in a state of descent— this is called night. And through such sensations, %0aintervals are formed between the sensations of day. %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Night of the Bride %0a%0a%0a%0a303 %0a%0a%0a%0a%0a, now %0a%0a%0a%0athe whole, each degree is separated from one another. Night %0ato attain the Creator. And while each night is full of darkness, %0aall the nights (states of feeling emptiness, hopelessness, heaviness of efforts, the %0aCreator's concealment) gather together and form a unified vessel of reception %0aof Supernal wisdom, which fills the entire earth with Knowledge of the Creator, %0aand the nights shine like days. %0a%0aFor each night receives its own part of Knowledge only by joining with the %0ather nights. Thus, each night is said to help the other nights in the Knowledge, %0adifferently, man is ready to receive the Knowledge only if he joins with th %0anights. %0a%0aAnd since night is a feeling of lacking knowledge, attainment, and sensation %0a)f the Creator by uniting, they form a perfect vessel of reception of the Knowledge %0aof the Creator. And they praise one another, for each has received his share of %0athe Knowledge of the Creator thanks exclusively to his friend, through uniting %0a1. Only in unity do they merit reception of the Supernal Knowledge, %0aaid that through the perfection achieved by all, the nights becam%3c %0a%0a%0a%0a%0a141. Does he speak of the others in the world who do not obey the Creator, %0aand whom He does not wish to hear? But they made lines through all the %0aearth, that is, these things make a line out of those that reside Above and out %0aof those that reside below. From the first— firmaments are made, and from the %0asecond, from their return— earth. And should you say that they revolve around %0athe earth in one place, it is said that they are also at the end of the world. %0a%0aThus far, we have discussed the most terrible punishments and suffering in %0athe world— being detached from the Creator and losing faith in Him. Moreover, %0aThe Zohar tells us that all the punishments, all the suffering of hell and of the %0abody, which stem from personal sins and fill this world, also gather and are %0aincluded into one great Zivug, as it is written: "And it shall come to pass, that as %0athe Lord rejoiced over you to do you good, and to multiply you; so the Lord will %0arejoice over you to cause you to perish, and to destroy you" (Devarim, 28:63). %0a%0aAll will gather and become one great Light, and everything will turn to %0agreat joy and bliss. It is therefore said that THERE IS NO SHEAF AND NO %0aTHINGS IN THE OTHER WORDS OF THE WORLD, which man perceives %0ain this world as suffering. But they will turn to joy and bliss, and thus the holy %0aKing, too, shall wish to hear them. %0a%0aSo, all the suffering during the 6,000 years will gather at the end of correction %0aand will become a tremendous delight, as the prophet said: "In those days and %0a%0a%0a%0a304 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0ain that time, said the Lord, even if the iniquity of Israel shall be sought for, there %0ashall be none" (Yirmiyahu, 50:20). %0a%0aEverything will turn to merits, so much so that they will ask and search "for %0athe past sins that can be included in the Zivug, and which can be laughed at, %0afor they were felt as suffering and now they are joy and bliss," but they will not %0afind any. There will be no more suffering in its true form, as it was in the past, %0aalthough they greatly desire to find it and feel it, for all suffering will have now %0abeen turned to great Light. %0a%0aThis Supernal Degree, created by the great Zivug out of all the souls and all %0athe deeds, both good and evil, is now defined as a pillar of Light, which shines %0afrom one end of the world to the other. And this unity is perfect, as is said by %0athe prophet (Zachariah, 14:9): "And the Creator shall be one (for all), and His %0aName one"— all the senses will grasp the Creator's complete and perfect name, %0a"the Infinitely good." %0a%0aPrecisely because this most Supernal Degree is achieved as a result of %0abringing together all the suffering and punishments, it fills the entire universe %0awith Light, including earth. However, it should be noted that the suffering of %0awhich The Zohar speaks is not the suffering of the body's lack of pleasure. It is %0athe suffering caused by the absence of unity with the Creator! %0a%0aBut if suffering is so useful, why is it written, "neither them nor the %0areward for them?" Suffering is necessary, for it is correction. However, the %0atrue suffering, for which man can receive the degree of the end of correction, %0ais caused by temporary distancing from the Torah and Mitzvot as a result of %0afeeling the pain of suffering, and this pains the Creator. Thus, the Shechina %0asuffers, for when man suffers in his heart, he speaks ill of her, willingly or %0aunwillingly. Although the Torah tells him to be patient, to endure and have %0afaith above reason— selfless faith that all of this is the correction that he must %0aundergo— he debases the Shechina by being unwilling to endure them and %0aachieve the end of correction. %0a%0aMan's soul is also a Partzuf consisting of ten Sefirot. In its initial, spiritually %0aundeveloped, unborn state, the soul is defined as a point, as a potential future %0aspiritual body. If man works on himself, this point within him gradually acquires %0aa screen, and he makes a Zivug on it. He repels all the pleasures for the sake of %0athe Creator's desires, and receives Light in this point. Thus, he "amplifies" it to %0athe size of a Partzuf and transforms it into a body, a newborn Partzuf. %0a%0aAfterwards he continues to cultivate his screen, gradually nurturing the %0asmall state into the big one, until he receives all of the Light destined for him %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Night of the Bride %0a%0a%0a%0a305 %0a%0a%0a%0aby the Creator within his spiritual body. This state is called "the end of the %0apersonal correction." When all the personal corrections merge into one, the %0ageneral correction of the entire world (of Malchut) will occur. Malchut is a Partzuf %0athat consists of separate souls; each soul, the Partzuf of each soul, is part of %0aMalchut, and Malchut is a collection, the sum of all the Partzufim that are to be %0amade by all the people. To make a Partzuf is to acquire a screen and become %0afilled with Light. %0a%0aTHOSE THAT RESIDE ABOVE AND THOSE THAT RESIDE BELOW %0arefers to the order of time in the spiritual, eternal world, which is different from %0aours. When the Creator wished to create the world, He immediately created %0aeverything: all the souls filled with Light in a state of absolute perfection, called %0a"the end of correction," where all the creatures receive the infinite delight that %0aHe envisioned. %0a%0aThis ultimate state was born with the Creator's first thought to create the %0aworld, and it exists in its final form from the very first moment, for the future, %0apresent, and past are merged in the Creator, and the factor of time does not %0aexist in Him. %0a%0a%0a%0a1. Change of time: the stretching of time into infinity, i.e., when time %0astops and the present merges with the past and the future; when %0atime reverses its course or disappears. Yet, time is the only thing that %0aprovides us with a perception of existence. By "switching off time, we %0astop perceiving that we exist! %0a%0a2. Transformation of space: expanding and contracting of space into %0apoint; space taking other forms, other dimensions; infinity and tota %0aabsence of space altogether. %0a%0aI've already dealt with these issues in my book, Kabbalah, Science and the %0aMeaning of Life, and I would prefer not to digress from the text of The Zohar. %0aHowever, to understand our true state, and not the one we currently perceive, it %0ais essential to remember that notions of time and space do not exist with regard to %0aCreator. In reality, we are completely different and exist in a completely different %0aform and state from what we presently perceive. We feel this way because our %0asensations are distorted by our egoism, which infuse our senses and possess our %0abodies, like a cloud. %0a%0aTherefore, all that is described in the Torah refers strictly to the spiritual %0a%0a%0a%0a306 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0aand future, for time exists only with regard to those who are still confir %0atheir egoistic Kelim (desires). From this we can understand what is said %0aTorah: "The Creator showed Adam each generation and its representatives, %0ashowed it to Moshe as well" (Talmud, Sanhedrin, 38:2). %0a%0aYet, if the above described unfolded before the creation of these generations, %0ahow can the Creator show them to Adam and Moshe? It is possible because all %0athe souls with all their destinies from the moment of their creation to the end of %0atheir correction emerged before the Creator in their completeness and reside in %0athe Supernal Garden of Eden. From there they descend and enter the bodies %0aour world, each at their own "time." And there, "Above," the Creator re %0athem to Adam, Moshe, and all the others who were worthy of it. Howeve %0ais a difficult notion, and not every mind is ready to grasp it. %0a%0aTherefore, The Zohar says (Terumah, 163) that the way the six Sefirot of Zeir %0aAnpin unite as ONE above Chazeh, de Zeir Anpin, where they are free from the %0aKlipot, Malchut unites with Zeir Anpin below his Chazeh, so that unity exists %0abelow, as it does Above. For the Creator (Zeir Anpin) is One (male) Above. And %0aMalchut becomes One (female), so that One (male) would be with One (female). %0aThis is the secret of unity expressed in the words: "He and His Name are one"; %0a"He" (ZA) and "His Name" (Malchut) are within one another. %0a%0aThe degree that is born at the end of correction, in the state of "He and %0aHis Name are one," already exists Above as the sum of all the 600,000 souls and %0adeeds during the 6,000 degrees (called "years") in the world, which will emerge %0abefore the end of correction, but exist in their eternal form Above, where the %0afuture is as present. %0a%0aTherefore, the pillar of Light that will shine upon the world from one end %0ato the other at the end of correction already exists in the Supernal Garden %0aof Eden, which illuminates it with the same brilliance that will be revealed to %0aus in the future. This is because at the end of correction the two degrees will %0ashine as one, and "He and His Name will be one." A pillar (line) of Light will %0aappear, made of those that reside Above (the souls that reside in the Supernal %0aGarden of Eden) and those that reside below (the souls clothed in the bodies %0aof our world). And "One receives One"; these two degrees shine together, and %0areveal the Creator's unity thereby, as it is said that on that day "He and His %0aName will be one." %0a%0aFrom the aforesaid one can assume that the pillar of Light that shines in %0athe Supernal Garden of Eden descends and shines in the Garden of Eden of %0aour world. But this is not so. Rather, FROM THE FIRST-FIRMAMENTS %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Night of the Bride %0a%0a%0a%0a307 %0a%0a%0a%0aARE MADE, for this degree exits onto a Zivug of Yesod of Zeir Anpin, called %0a"firmament." Therefore, all the Zivugim that ascend above the firmament shine %0aupon those that receive them from the firmament and below. The degree above %0athe firmament is referred to as "Heaven," and the degree that receives from the %0afirmament is called "earth." %0a%0aWhen the line (pillar) of Light unites the inhabitants of Above and those %0aof below, the distinction between the Supernal Garden of Eden and the %0ainhabitants of this world still remains. This is because the inhabitants of the %0aSupernal Garden of Eden receive from a Zivug above the firmament, and what %0athey receive is called "the new Heaven for the inhabitants of Above." And only %0aa small luminescence, called "the new earth," descends below the firmament to %0athe inhabitants of below. This is what The Zohar says: "From the first— firmaments %0aare made, and from the second, from their return— earth." %0a%0aAlthough in this great Zivug, as in all Zivugim, all that is decided above the %0afirmament, above the Zivug, spreads down to earth, below the line of the Zivug, %0aone should not think that this Zivug (like all the previous ones) is merely a thin %0aline of Light, called "one," a limited, inner place, as it is written at the beginning %0aof creation: "Let the waters gather together unto one place," i.e., in the inner %0aplace of the worlds (and not the outer), a place of Israel. %0a%0aBut the Light of this Zivug revolves around the world and fills it whole. This %0aLight reaches even the outer parts of the worlds (the nations of the world), as %0athe prophet writes: "The earth shall be filled with Knowledge of the Creator" %0a(Yeshayahu, 11:9). %0a%0a142. And since out of them Heavens were created, who resides there? He %0areturned and said, "There is a shelter for the sun in them. This is the holy %0asun, called Zeir Anpin, and it dwells and resides there, and adorns itself %0awith them." %0a%0a143. Since Zeir Anpin resides in those firmaments and clothes in them, he %0aemerges like a bridegroom out of his wedding canopy, and rejoices and races %0aalong these firmaments, and exits them and enters, and races toward a tower %0ain a different place. He emerges from one end of Heaven, from the Upper %0aWorld, from the Highest place, from Bina. And his season— where is it? It is %0athe opposite place below, i.e., Malchut, which is the year's season that forms %0aall the ends and binds everything— from Heaven to this firmament. %0a%0aThe Zohar speaks of the great secret of the sun coming out of its hiding. It is %0aworth noting that Kabbalists often use the word "secret" only to explain and as %0aif reveal the mystery in the passages that follow. The reader should nevertheless %0a%0a%0a%0a308 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0ai that there are no secrets in the world. Man attains everything frc %0ain our world, in the process of his mental development, %0aattains new notions on every new degree. And whatever he considered %0aonly yesterday now becomes clear and revealed before him. %0a%0aThe same is true with regard to spiritual attainments. Kabbalah is called a %0asecret wisdom, for it is concealed from ordinary people, it is a secret to them. But %0aas soon as one acquires a screen and begins to perceive the spiritual world, he %0asees the secret becomes a reality. And this process continues until he completely %0aattains the entire universe, all of the Creator's secrets ("Introduction to the %0aStudy of the Ten Sefirot," item 148). %0a%0aThe sun emerges from its hiding (sheath— Nartik), from under the Huppah, %0aand rushes to a tower at a different place— after the great Zivug under the Huppah. %0aZeir Anpin leaves his hiding and enters Malchut, called the tower of Oz (strength) %0aof the Creator's Name, for Malchut then ascends and unites with ZA, and they %0abecome as one. %0a%0aThe end of Malchut is called "the year's season." And until the end of %0acorrection, the impure forces, called "the end of days," attach themselves to %0ait. Now, after the end of correction, it is still necessary to correct this part of %0aMalchut, called "the end of days." To this end, the sun emerges from its hiding, %0aLIKE THE BRIDEGROOM EMERGING FROM UNDER THE HUPPAH, %0aand shines, and enters the tower of Oz (Malchut), races and shines on all the %0aends of Malchut to correct "the year's season" of the lower end of Heaven. %0a%0aFor this last action corrects all the ends of Malchut and unites all from the %0aHeavens to the firmament. In other words, Malchut receives the Light of THE %0aEND OF HEAVENS above the firmament (ZA). %0a%0a144. There is nothing hidden on account of the year's season and the phase %0aof the sun that revolves in all directions. And there is no concealment, i.e., %0anot a single Supernal Degree is hidden from him, for all were bound together %0aand everyone appeared before him, and none could be concealed from him. %0aThanks to him and thanks to them he returned to them, to the friends, in the %0aphase of complete return and correction. All this year and all this time is for %0athe Torah (to study it), as it is written: "The Creator's Torah is perfect." %0a%0aAfter the great Zivug, a restriction was imposed on all the Upper Light %0a(item 94). Therefore, a new Zivug (TOWER) is necessary, which reveals anew %0aall of the Upper Light that was concealed on account of the disappearance of %0athe degree of BON, before it begins to ascend to SAG. Thus, NOTHING IS %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Night of the Bride %0a%0a%0a%0a309 %0a%0a%0a%0aCONCEALED FROM THAT PHASE OF THE SUN THAT REVOLVES IN %0aALL DIRECTIONS. %0a%0aIndeed, a Zivug between the phase of the sun and the year's season corrects %0athe ends of Malchut on all sides, until the correction is completed. Thus, BON %0aascends and becomes like SAG, which amounts to the complete correction %0aof BON, whereupon THERE IS NO CONCEALMENT, NOT A SINGLE %0aSUPERNAL DEGREE IS CONCEALED FROM HIM, for all the degrees and %0athe Upper Light are once more revealed in their perfection. AND NOTHING %0aCAN BE CONCEALED FROM Him, for all the degrees and Light gradually %0areturn to Him, until all become revealed. %0a%0aIt is hence said that the revelation does not occur at once, for while in %0aits phase, the sun travels and shines in sufficient measure for a COMPLETE %0aRETURN, as it is written that He punishes the sinners and cures the righteous, %0awhereupon they all merit the complete revelation of the Star. %0a%0a145. The word HdVaYaH is written six times, and there are six verses from %0a"the Heavens declare" and until "The Creator's Torah is perfect" (Tehilim, %0a19:2-8). And this is the secret of the word BERESHEET, which consists of %0asix letters: THE CREATOR CREATED ET (THE) HEAVENS AND THE %0aEARTH, six words in all. The other sources of the verse from "The Creator's %0aTorah is perfect" and until "they are better than gold" (Tehilim, 19:2-8) %0acorrespond to the six utterances of the name HaVaYaH in them. The sources %0afrom "the Heavens declare" through "The Creator's Torah is perfect" are for %0athe six letters in the word BERESHEET, whereas the six names are for the %0asix words from "the Creator created" through "the Heavens and the earth." %0a%0aIt is known that any degree born or revealed in the worlds is first revealed %0athrough its letters, which signifies the, as yet, unattainable. Afterwards, it %0aappears in the combination of letters. This degree then becomes attainable, %0aits contents become known, as previously described with the letters RYU = 216 %0aandAB = 72 (item 116). %0a%0aThe six letters in the word BERESHEET contain everything that exists in %0aHeaven and on earth, but in an unattainable form, and are hence designated by %0athese letters alone, without their combinations. Then there are the six words: %0aBara Elokim Et Ha-Shamayim Ve-Et Ha-Aretz (THE CREATOR CREATED THE %0aHEAVENS AND THE EARTH), where everything that the word BERESHEET %0acontains (Heaven, earth, and all their inhabitants) is already attained. %0a%0aThe same principle allows us to understand what is included in the six %0averses from "the Heavens declare" to "The Creator's Torah is perfect." This is %0a%0a%0a%0a310 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0ajust the beginning of the revelation of attaining the end of creation in the form %0aof letters, as with the six letters in the word BERESHEET. %0a%0aAnd the complete revelation, the attainment of the end of creation begins %0awith the verse "The Creator's Torah is perfect." This verse contains six names, %0aeach of which constitutes unique attainment, thus indicating that only after the %0acompletion of this degree do all the letter combinations become revealed and %0aattained in the great Zivug at the end of correction, as it is said, NOTHING IS %0aCONCEALED IN CONSEQUENCE OF HIM. %0a%0aThis is why The Zohar says that THE WORD BERESHEET, WHICH %0aCONSISTS OF six, IS WRITTEN (SPEAKS) ABOUT THIS SECRET. The %0aword BERESHEET contains six letters, where Heaven and earth are concealed, %0abefore they become revealed in the six words, THE CREATOR CREATED %0aTHE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH. %0a%0aThe same applies to the six verses (Tehilim, 19:2-8): the great Zivug of the %0aend of correction is not yet revealed from THE HEAVENS DECLARE to THE %0aCREATOR'S TORAH IS PERFECT. Only after NOTHING IS CONCEALED %0aIN CONSEQUENCE OF HIM are the six names revealed, which in turn reveal %0athe end of correction in its full perfection. %0a%0a146. As they were sitting and talking, Rabbi Elazar, the son of Rabbi Shimon, %0aentered. He said to them: "Certainly, the face of the Shechina has come, hence %0aI called you Pniel (Pnei-face + El-Creator = the Creator's face)" (item 119), %0afor you have seen the Shechina face to face. And now that you have attained %0aBenayahu Ben-Yehoyada, it certainly refers to Atik, the Sefira of Keter, just %0aas everything else that occurred afterwards, as it is written in the Torah: "And %0ahe slew the Egyptian." And he who is concealed from all— is Atik. %0a%0aIt is said in the continuation of "The Donkey Driver," who revealed the soul %0aof Benayahu Ben-Yehoyada to Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Aba, as a result of which %0aRabbi Shimon called them Pniel. For the soul of Benayahu Ben-Yehoyada is a %0aspiritual degree destined to be revealed in the future, at the end of correction. %0aThis is why they were in a state of concealment of the Upper Light (item 113), %0aas was already mentioned with regard to the Zivug of the sun's phase and the %0ayear's season, until they have found Rabbi Shimon Ben Lakunya and others, %0athus meriting all the Light once again. %0a%0aTherefore, Rabbi Shimon says to them, YOU HAVE ATTAINED, %0aBENAYAHU BEN-YEHOYADA WAS REVEALED TO YOU. This means %0athat they have already attained the six verses, the essence of THE HEAVENS %0aDECLARE, and exist in the six names. When they have attained the soul of %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Night of the Bride %0a%0a%0a%0a311 %0a%0a%0a%0aBenayahu Ben-Yehoyada with the help of the donkey driver, their attainment %0ahad not yet been revealed to them, as they still existed in the six verses— the %0areason for their concealment. But now they have attained and revealed his soul, %0athat it is the great Zivug of Atik, when everything is revealed to all. %0a%0a147. The words, "He slew the Egyptian" are explained in another place, i.e., %0aat a different degree, in a different way. He opened and said, "He slew the %0aEgyptian, a man of good stature, five cubits high." All of this refers to the %0asame secret. This Egyptian is the one who is well-known and is described as %0a"very great in the land of Egypt in the eyes of the Jew," for he is great and %0ahonored, as that old man had already explained (item 99). %0a%0aThe Torah describes the killing of the Egyptian in the book Shemot (2:12). %0aAs we have already learned from the article about Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba, it is %0aexpressed differently at a different degree (in a different language, the language %0aof Divrey HaYamim). However, these two verses are the same secret, for it is %0awritten in the book Shmuel 1 (11:23): "And he slew the Egyptian, a prominent %0aman," while in Divrey HaYamim it is written: "And he slew the Egyptian, a man %0aof good stature, five cubits high." Both verses are the same secret, which The %0aZohar continues to clarify. %0a%0a148. This case was examined at the Divine Assembly. "A prominent man" %0aand "a man of good stature" are the same, as they constitute Shabbat and %0athe bounds of Shabbat. As it is written: "You shall measure it from outside %0athe city." It is also written, "You shall not impede limitations in measure." %0aHence, he was a man of good stature. Precisely such, from one end of the %0aworld to the other. Such is he, Adam, the first man. And should you disagree, %0areferring to the written "five cubits," know that these five cubits extend from %0aone end of the world to the other. %0a%0aThe matter concerns the Divine Assembly, of which Rabbi Shimon said: "I %0asaw those ascending, but how few they were" (Talmud, Sukkah, 45:2). There is a %0alower assembly of the angel Matat. However, the described above takes place in %0athe Supernal Assembly, which will be clarified further. %0a%0a"A prominent man" is the degree of Moshe, of whom it is written in the %0aTorah: "And there hath not since risen a prophet in Israel such as Moshe" %0a(Devarim, 34: 10), of whom it is written "My servant Moshe is not so; he is trusted %0ain all My house; with him do I speak mouth to mouth, clearly, and not with %0ariddles" (Bamidbar, 12:7-8). %0a%0a"A prominent man" also constitutes a measure, which extends from one end %0aof the world to the other. Moreover, its form and size correspond to Shabbat and %0a%0a%0a%0a312 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0athe bounds of Shabbat, where the bounds of Shabbat are the end of its measure. %0aDuring the 6,000 years, the bounds of Shabbat are limited by only 2,000 Amah %0a(cubits). However, after the end of correction, the bounds of Shabbat will extend %0afrom one end of the world to the other, as it is written: "And the Lord shall be %0aKing over all the earth" (Zachariah, 14:9). %0a%0aAs we already know, the Light can descend and fill the Partzufim down to the %0alevel of Parsa of the world of Atzilut. Shabbat is a spiritual state when the worlds %0aof BYA with all that inhabit them rise above the Parsa to the world of Atzilut. %0aAbove Parsa are only pure forces, corrected desires (Kelim). Hence, naturally %0athere is no need to separate pure Kelim from impure ones and to correct them %0aduring Shabbat. %0a%0aHowever, the Light of Shabbat shines not only in the world of Atzilut, but %0abeyond its bounds as well. It thus affects the sixteen Sefirot from Parsa down to %0aCha^eh of the world of Yetzira so the soul can be in the state of "Shabbat" with %0athese desires, too. The language of our world describes this as the permission %0ato transcend the bounds of the city of Atzilut (seventy Amah) by 2,000 Amah %0adown to the Chazeh of the world of Beria, and then another 2,000 Amah from %0aChazeh of the world of Beria to Chazeh of the world of Yetzira. (Seventy Amah are %0aregarded as being within the city limits.) %0a%0aHowever, after all the Kelim (desires) are corrected, there will be no %0arestrictions; the world of Atzilut will extend down to our world, and only the %0astate of Shabbat will prevail in the entire world— in all desires of all creatures. %0a%0aIt is hence written: A PROMINENT MAN and A MAN OF GOOD %0aSTATURE are one and the same, for they constitute Shabbat and the bounds %0aof Shabbat, as is said: AND YOU SHALL MEASURE FROM OUTSIDE THE %0aCITY, and it is also written: YOU SHALL NOT IMPEDE JUDGMENT IN %0aMEASURE. It follows that an object's measure represents its limit, just as %0athe words A MAN OF GOOD STATURE alludes to the end, the bounds of %0aShabbat after the end of correction, which will extend from one end of the %0aworld to the other. %0a%0aAND HE SHALL BE PRECISELY MAN OF GOOD STATURE indicates %0athat size does not rule over him; rather, he rules over size, and it is he who %0adetermines this size according to his own will. SUCH IS HE, ADAM, who, %0aprior to his sin, extended and shone from one end of the world to the other %0a(Talmud, Hagigah, 12:1), as the bounds of Shabbat after the end of correction. %0a%0aFIVE CUBITS FROM ONE END OF THE WORLD TO THE OTHER- %0abecause the five cubits are the five Sefirot: Keter, Hochma, Bina, ZA, and Malchut %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Night of the Bride %0a%0a%0a%0a313 %0a%0a%0a%0athat expand and fill everything from one end of the world to the other after the %0aend of correction. %0a%0a149. It is, as is written, "like a weaver's beam" (Shmuel 1, 17: 7) "as the %0aDivine staff" (Shemot, 4:20) that was in his hand, which reveals by the %0asecret name (Light) confirmed in it by the Light of the letter combinations %0athat Betzalel and his disciples engraved, called "weaving," as is written, %0a"He filled them and others, and BOUND them." And that staff— within it %0ashone a secret name, inscribed on all its sides by the Light of the sages, who %0aconfirmed the secret name in forty-two properties. And the rest of what %0ais written from here onward is similar to what the old man had already %0aexplained. Happy is his lot! %0a%0aThe secret of the letter combinations in sacred names is called "weaving," %0alike a weaver joins his threads into a fabric, the letters join into combinations of %0asacred names, which designate man's spiritual level of their attainment. Hence, %0aThe Zohar says that the Creator's staff in Moshe's hand had engraved the letter %0acombinations of the secret name, which Betzalel and his disciples engraved as %0athey worked on the Tabernacle. %0a%0aThe Creator's staff is therefore called a "weaver's beam." The Hebrew word %0afor "beam" is MANOR (from OHR— Light). This refers to the Light of the letter %0acombinations in the secret name, which Betzalel weaved and engraved, as it is %0asaid, "by the Light of the letter combinations that Betzalel engraved." %0a%0aHowever, the staff does not shine in all directions until the end of correction, %0afor there is a distinction between the Creator's staff and that of Moshe. It is %0awritten of the staff of Moshe: "Put forth your hand and take it by the tail (of a %0asnake), and it shall become a staff in your hand" (Shemot, 4:4). This means that %0ait did not shine from all sides. %0a%0aHowever, after the end of correction, it will shine in all directions, as it is %0asaid: "And the secret name shone from within that staff in all directions by the %0aLight of sages, who confirmed the secret name in forty-two properties." For the %0asecret name that was engraved on the staff shone in all directions, i.e., in the %0aproperty called "He will eradicate death forever" (Yeshayahu, 25:8). It will thus %0abegin to shine evenly in all directions, whereas the Light of the name engraved %0aon the staff is the Light of Hochma of the Name MB. %0a%0a150. Be seated, dear friends. Be seated and let us renew the correction of the %0aBride on this night, for whomever joins her on this night shall be guarded %0aAbove and below in the coming year. And this year shall pass over him in %0apeace. Such people are described in the verse: "The angel of the Lord stands %0a%0a%0a%0a314 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0around those that fear Him, and delivers them. O taste and see that the Creator %0ais good" (Tehilim, 34:8-9). %0a%0aAs was already stated in item 125, there are two explanations of the aforesaid. %0aThe first is that since the day of the giving of the Torah is the Light of the end %0aof correction that abolishes death forever and brings freedom from the angel of %0adeath, one should exert to receive this Light on the day of Shavuot (Pentecost), as %0aLight is renewed on the holiday and brings deliverance from death. %0a%0aAccording to the second explanation, Malchut is called a "year," and the %0arenewal of the Light by those who keep the Torah after the end of correction %0awill also bring the complete and final correction of the year (Malchut). This is %0abecause the renewal of the Light by those who keep the Torah is referred to as %0athe correction of the night of the bride, Malchut, called a "year." And this brings %0aus to a corrected year.

diff:1688308116:1688308116:=1,1815d0%0a%3c The Night of the Bride %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 125. Rabbi Shimon was sitting and studying the Torah on the night when the %0a%3c Bride, Malchut, unites with her husband, Zeir Anpin. And all the friends %0a%3c present in the bridal chamber on that night, the eve of the holiday of Shavuot %0a%3c (Pentecost), must stand together with the bridegroom under the Huppah %0a%3c (wedding canopy), and be with him this whole night, and rejoice with him %0a%3c in the corrections of the Bride, i.e., study the Torah, then Prophets, then %0a%3c Holy Scriptures, and finally the wisdom, for these corrections are the Bride's %0a%3c adornments. And the Bride receives corrections, adorns herself with them, %0a%3c and rejoices with them all of that night. And on the next day, on the holiday of %0a%3c Shavuot, she only comes to the Huppah together with them. And her friends, %0a%3c who studied the Torah all night long, are called the sons of the Huppah. And as %0a%3c she approaches the Huppah, the Creator asks about them, blesses and adorns %0a%3c them with the Bride's adornments. Happy are those who merit this! %0a%3c %0a%3c All the days of exile are called night, for this is when the Creator's face is %0a%3c concealed from Israel, as the impure forces rule and separate His loyal servants %0a%3c from Him. Yet, this is the time when the bride unites with her husband (in %0a%3c Hebrew, "husband" and "master" are the same word, so one must keep in mind %0a%3c the second meaning of the word as well). The Huppah is a wedding canopy, under %0a%3c which the ritual of union between a bride and a bridegroom (their merging in %0a%3c a Zivug) takes place. %0a%3c %0a%3c The union between the bride and her husband (The Zohar uses the word %0a%3c "husband" instead of "bridegroom") occurs thanks to the Torah and Mitzvot %0a%3c (commandments) of the righteous, referred to as "those who keep the Torah." %0a%3c And all the Supernal Degrees, called "secrets of the Torah," become revealed %0a%3c thanks to them alone, for they are also called MAKERS (as though CREATING %0a%3c the Torah itself), as is described in item 124. Therefore, the time of exile is called %0a%3c the NIGHT WHEN THE BRIDE UNITES WITH HER HUSBAND. AND %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 281 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 282 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ALL THE FRIENDS, THE SONS OF THE BRIDE'S JOY, ARE CALLED %0a%3c THOSE WHO KEEP THE TORAH. %0a%3c %0a%3c And after THE END OF CORRECTION and complete deliverance, of %0a%3c which the prophet Zachariah writes (14:7): "And there shall be one day, which %0a%3c shall be known to the Creator, neither day nor night, but it shall come to pass %0a%3c come evening time: there shall be light." THE NEXT DAY, THE BRIDE AND %0a%3c HER HUSBAND ENTER THE HUPPAH, for BON will become like SAG and %0a%3c MA will be like AB (see item 64). %0a%3c %0a%3c This state is therefore defined as the next day and a new Huppah. Whereas %0a%3c at this time (in this state), the righteous are called SONS OF THE HUPPAH, %0a%3c in whom there is no action, for then, as it is written: "They shall not do evil %0a%3c upon My holy mountain, for the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the %0a%3c Creator, as waters cover the sea" (Yeshayahu, 11:9). %0a%3c %0a%3c And since these righteous elevated BON to SAG by their actions, i.e., made %0a%3c its properties similar to those of SAG, they are considered to have made a new %0a%3c Huppah, they are called "sons of the Huppah." %0a%3c %0a%3c The night of Shavuot (Pentecost) is when THE BRIDE UNITES WITH HER %0a%3c HUSBAND, for the Huppah takes place on the next day, the day of Shavuot, the %0a%3c day of the reception of the Torah. On that day, all of creation achieves the state %0a%3c of the end of correction, as it is said: "He will swallow up death forever; and the %0a%3c Creator Himself will wipe away the tears off all faces" (Yeshayahu, 25:8). %0a%3c %0a%3c The Torah describes this state as "engraved upon the scrolls" (Shemot, 32: 16). %0a%3c In Hebrew, the word "engraved" is Harut, but it should be pronounced Herut %0a%3c (freedom), freedom from the angel of death. However, the sin of the golden calf %0a%3c followed and the High Degree was lost. Since Shavuot is the day when the Torah %0a%3c was received, it is also regarded as the end of correction. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, all the necessary preparations (the corrections carried out %0a%3c during the concealment period) are completed beforehand, on the night %0a%3c before the holiday of Shavuot. This night is hence defined as the night when %0a%3c the bride unites with her husband so as to enter the Huppah the following %0a%3c day, on the holiday of Shavuot, when all the corrections are completed and %0a%3c liberated from the angel of death, thanks to the actions of the righteous, who %0a%3c erect a new Hu£>£>ah. %0a%3c %0a%3c All of the bride's friends, those who keep the Torah, also called "sons of %0a%3c the bridal chamber," must be merged with the Shechina-Malchut (the bride) all %0a%3c of that night, called "exile." Only then do their acts in the Torah and Mitzvot %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Night of the Bride %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 283 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c correct and purify the good in her from the taint of evil, so she would emerge %0a%3c with the properties that contain only good, without evil. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, those who keep the Torah should rejoice together with the bride %0a%3c for all the great corrections that they've made in her. Then they joyously %0a%3c continue with their corrections in THE TORAH, then in PROPHETS and %0a%3c finally in the HOLY SCRIPTURES. All the degrees and revelations of the %0a%3c secrets of the Torah, which make up the framework of the Shechina herself at %0a%3c the end of her correction, are made exclusively by the righteous, who keep the %0a%3c Torah during the exile. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, all the degrees that emerge at the time (state) of the exile are %0a%3c called the bride's corrections and adornments from the Torah, Prophets and %0a%3c Holy Scriptures, for Sefirot Hesed, Gevura, and Tifferet constitute the Torah, Sefirot %0a%3c Net^ah, Hod, and Yesod are the Prophets, and Malchut is the Holy Scriptures. The %0a%3c Light of VAK is called Midrashim and the Light of GAR is called "the secrets of %0a%3c the Torah." And all these corrections must be made in Malchut (the bride) on %0a%3c the night when she completes her corrections (precisely in the darkness of exile %0a%3c from the spiritual does man carry out the work of his inner correction). %0a%3c %0a%3c It is known that the end of correction does not bring anything new or that %0a%3c was previously unknown. Rather, all the MAN and MAD, along with all degrees %0a%3c and Zivugim that have emerged consecutively during the 6,000 years will merge %0a%3c into one degree and become corrected with the help of the Light of Atik. %0a%3c %0a%3c The bride will then enter her Huppah, and THE CREATOR WILL ASK %0a%3c ABOUT EVERYONE, about every man who had even once raised MAN for the %0a%3c Supernal, final Zivug. For the Creator waits for all the small Zivugim to assemble, %0a%3c as though asking about and waiting for each of them. And when they've %0a%3c gathered, a great Zivug will unfold, called RAV PAALIM U MEKABTZIEL (HE %0a%3c WHO BLESSES AND ADORNS HER). And when all the creatures are blessed %0a%3c and adorned together, correction comes to an end. This is referred to as "the %0a%3c adornment of the bride's crown." %0a%3c %0a%3c 126. This is why Rabbi Shimon and all of his friends stayed up that night, %0a%3c and each of them renewed the Torah again and again. Rabbi Shimon was %0a%3c joyous, and so were his friends. Rabbi Shimon said to them: "My sons, how %0a%3c blessed is your lot, for it is you who shall accompany the Bride tomorrow %0a%3c to the Huppah, for all those who correct Her and rejoice in Her this night %0a%3c shall have their names recorded in the Book of Remembrance. And the %0a%3c Creator shall bless them with seventy blessings and adornments of crowns %0a%3c of the Upper World." %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 284 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Book of Remembrance, mentioned by the prophet (Malachi, 3:15): "You %0a%3c will say, 'How futile it is to serve the Creator! When we carried out the Creator's %0a%3c will, and walked heavy-hearted before Him— what is the use of it all? And now %0a%3c we regard the wicked as blessed: they have settled in their wickedness, tried the %0a%3c Creator, and were liberated.' Then those who feared the Creator spoke with %0a%3c each other, and the Creator hearkened and heard, and a Book of Remembrance %0a%3c was recorded before Him for those who fear the Creator and honor His Name. %0a%3c 'They shall become chosen for Me on the day that I shall determine, and I shall %0a%3c spare them, as a man spares his own son, who serves him.'" %0a%3c %0a%3c But how can we understand that when they spoke ill of the Creator, %0a%3c they referred to fear of the Creator, as the prophet says? Moreover, they were %0a%3c inscribed in the Book of Remembrance as those who "feared the Creator and %0a%3c honored His Name?" %0a%3c %0a%3c The thing is that at the end of correction, when the great general Zivug %0a%3c of AtiJc manifests, great Light will be revealed in all the worlds, and in this %0a%3c Light everyone will return to the Creator in absolute love. The Talmud (Yoma, %0a%3c 86:2, "Introduction to the Study of the Ten Sefirot") says: "He who attains the %0a%3c repentance from love shall have his sins turned to merits." %0a%3c %0a%3c Here, the prophet refers to the sinners claiming the futility of spiritual %0a%3c work: on the great day of the end of correction, when the Light of repentance %0a%3c from love shall shine, all the most malicious and deliberate, worst imaginable %0a%3c sins, will turn to merits, and their words shall be deemed not slight, but fear %0a%3c of the Creator. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, all the sins, as well as all the good deeds, are recorded before the %0a%3c Creator, for He will need them on that great day of His miracle: all the merits %0a%3c gather and complete the Kli, which receives the Light necessary for the final %0a%3c correction. Hence, it is said that the Creator shall record the names of those %0a%3c who fear Him in the Book of Remembrance, for He will need them on that day %0a%3c to complete the common Partzuf. This is exactly what the prophet says: those %0a%3c who remain shall be close to the Creator, like sons who served Him. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is therefore said that everyone and everything will be recorded in the %0a%3c Book of Remembrance, even the sins. However, The Creator will record them %0a%3c as though they are merits, as though they served Him. These are the words of %0a%3c the prophet. %0a%3c %0a%3c The number seventy signifies the Light of Hochma, GAR, adornment, a %0a%3c crown, and the Light of Hassadim is called "a blessing," for the world was created %0a%3c with the letter Bet (blessing), as it is written: "The world was built by mercy" %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Night of the Bride %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 285 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c (Tehilim, 89:3), which is VAK. But at the end of correction, the Light of Hassadim %0a%3c will also be like seventy crowns, like the Light of Hochma, for MA and BON will %0a%3c ascend to AB and SAG. Therefore, The Zohar says that the Creator will bless %0a%3c them with seventy blessings and adornments of crowns of the Upper World. %0a%3c %0a%3c 127. Rabbi Shimon opened and said, "The Heavens declare the Creator's %0a%3c greatness. I have already explained this, but when the bride awakens to enter %0a%3c the Huppah on the following day, with all the friends who rejoiced with her %0a%3c through that night, she rejoices with them, corrects herself and shines with %0a%3c her adornments." %0a%3c %0a%3c 128. And on the following day, a multitude of masses, hosts, and legions %0a%3c join her. And she, together with all these masses, hosts and legions, awaits %0a%3c all those who corrected her by studying the Torah on that night. This is so %0a%3c because Zeir Anpin unites with Malchut, and she sees her husband, and %0a%3c it is said: "The Heavens declare the Creator's greatness." "The Heavens" %0a%3c alludes to the Bridegroom (ZA), who enters the Huppah. "The Heavens %0a%3c declare," i.e., shine, like the luminescence of a sapphire, upon the entire %0a%3c Malchut, from end to end. %0a%3c %0a%3c The day of the end of correction is called "tomorrow," as it is written in %0a%3c the Talmud: "Do today, and receive the reward tomorrow" (Eruvin, 22:1). The %0a%3c masses are the worldly masses who do not serve the Creator, the hosts are those %0a%3c who serve the Creator, and the legions are chariots of warriors in armor— the %0a%3c Supernal groups of angels that accompany the souls, as it is said: "For He bid %0a%3c His angels to guard over you on all your paths" (Tehilim, 91:11). Just as the %0a%3c Creator waits for everyone, as was previously stated, so does the Shechina. %0a%3c %0a%3c "Heavens" is the bridegroom entering the Huppah— the state of the end of %0a%3c correction, of which it is written: "And the light of the moon (Malchut) shall %0a%3c be as the light of the sun (ZA)" (Yeshayahu, 30:26). The Creator is called the %0a%3c "Heavens," and at the end of correction He is referred to as the "bridegroom," %0a%3c as it is said: "Just as a bridegroom rejoices over his bride, so shall your Creator %0a%3c rejoice over you." (Yeshayahu, 62:5). %0a%3c %0a%3c Wherever it is said that the Creator descends, it indicates His strictness %0a%3c and judgment, for it speaks of diminishing His greatness in the eyes of the %0a%3c lower ones, as it is said: "His might and greatness are in His place." But at the %0a%3c end of correction, when all sins turn to merits, for it will become clear that all %0a%3c the spiritual descents were nothing other than spiritual ascents, the Creator %0a%3c becomes the "bridegroom" and the Shechina becomes his "bride." %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 286 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Hebrew word for "bride" is Kalah, as in the words KalatMoshe (Bamidbar, %0a%3c 7), which describes the completion of the altar. Hence, in the Torah, the word %0a%3c Kalah signifies the end of construction. The Hebrew word for "bridegroom" %0a%3c is Hatan, and it signifies the descent along spiritual degrees, as it is said in the %0a%3c Talmud: "Descends the steps" (Yevamot, 63:1). However, this descent is greater %0a%3c than all the previous ascents, for it takes place on the way towards the bride at %0a%3c the moment of the end of correction. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Huppah represents the total of all the Returning Light received on the %0a%3c MAN raised by the righteous in all the Zivugim at all the times during the 6,000 %0a%3c years. This is because now they have all gathered into one great Returning Light, %0a%3c rising and soaring over the Creator and the Shechina, over the bridegroom and %0a%3c his bride, like a Huppah— wedding canopy. %0a%3c %0a%3c In this state, the righteous are called "Sons of the Huppah," for each of %0a%3c them has a part in this Huppah, to the extent of the MAN they raise to the %0a%3c screen of Malchut, which evoked, produced the Returning Light, corresponding %0a%3c in magnitude to this MAN. At the end of correction, the Creator is called Hatan %0a%3c (bridegroom), for He Nechit Darga— descends from His degree to his bride, and %0a%3c enters the Huppah. %0a%3c %0a%3c At this time (in this state), the Heavens say— this is a great Zivug of the future, %0a%3c as the Talmud says: "The wife speaks to her husband" (Berachot, 3:1). The word %0a%3c "speaks" (Mesaperet) implies a Zivug, and is derived from Sapir (sapphire), the %0a%3c name of the Shechina, as it is said in the Torah, "...and under His feet— like a %0a%3c pavement of sapphire" (Shemot, 24:10). %0a%3c %0a%3c THE LUMINESCENT SAPPHIRE is the Returning Light, ascending from %0a%3c below upwards. LUMINESCENT, LIKE LUMINESCENCE— The Returning %0a%3c Light, LUMINESCENT is equivalent to the Direct Light, LUMINESCENCE. %0a%3c This great Zivug gathers all of the Returning Light from all the Zivugim made %0a%3c during the 6,000 years, and the Direct Light will shine in it, as it is said, FROM %0a%3c END TO END. %0a%3c %0a%3c 129. The Creator's glory = EL— is the bride, Malchut, called EL, as it is %0a%3c written: "EL rages each day." She is called EL on all the days of the year. And %0a%3c now, on the holiday of Shavuot, when she already entered the Huppah, she %0a%3c is called GREATNESS and she is called EL, greatest of the great, luminescent %0a%3c out of the luminescent, dominion over dominions. %0a%3c %0a%3c El is the name of great mercy. Yet, here it says: "El rages each day," which is %0a%3c contrary to mercy. The Torah says: "And there shall be evening, and there shall %0a%3c be morning, one day." The Shechina is a small star, the Moon, which reigns at %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Night of the Bride %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 287 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c night. It is called "fear of Heaven," for it is the property of the righteous, who %0a%3c must raise MAN through their aspiration to be corrected, thereby evoking the %0a%3c Returning Light to descend on Malchut from Above and correct her. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is therefore written: "The Creator hath made it so man would fear Him" %0a%3c (Kohelet, 3:14). This is so because it is impossible to raise the MAN without fear. %0a%3c The absence of fear of the Creator is referred to as Malchut's reign at night, in %0a%3c the state of darkness. In the absence of Light, all the restrictions and suffering %0a%3c are revealed, as they are opposite to the property of day, mercy. Thus, fear of the %0a%3c Creator emerges; were it not for this fear, the property of morning and day could %0a%3c not be revealed. %0a%3c %0a%3c So it is written: "And there shall be evening, and there shall be morning, %0a%3c one day." Night also enters morning, for without a night, there would be no %0a%3c morning, and one cannot do without night. It is hence written that EL RAGES %0a%3c EACH DAY. After all, the property of mercy, called EL, is revealed only with the %0a%3c help of the night, through the property of RAGE. Hence, this property is also %0a%3c regarded as mercy; and consequently, the Shechina is called EL. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is why it is said that the CREATOR'S GREATNESS = EL-IS THE %0a%3c BRIDE, MALCHUT, CALLED EL, for it is impossible to achieve the state of %0a%3c "day" without the state of "night." So it is in each of the six days of creation, of %0a%3c which it is said: "And there shall be evening, and there shall be morning, one %0a%3c day." We see that the night is included in the name "day." And just as they are %0a%3c all called the six DAYS of creation, the 6,000 years are called "night" in the %0a%3c property of mercy. %0a%3c %0a%3c And in the great Zivug at the end of correction, a day shall come; the light of %0a%3c the moon will become like that of the sun, as the prophet said (Zachariah, 14:7): %0a%3c "It shall come to pass, that at evening time there shall be light." This will cause %0a%3c the degrees of Malchut to increase twofold, for even during the 6,000 years, the %0a%3c light of the moon was according to the aforesaid, "And there shall be evening, %0a%3c and there shall be morning." %0a%3c %0a%3c And at the end of correction, when the moon becomes like the sun (ZA), %0a%3c the moon will be twice as great as before, as it will become greatness itself, for %0a%3c its greatness will equal that of ZA, of which The Zohar says: THE GREATEST %0a%3c OF THE GREAT, DOMINION OVER DOMINIONS. Although it merged %0a%3c with the light of the morning during the 6,000 years, as it is said, "And there %0a%3c shall be evening, and there shall be morning, one day," now that it is as big %0a%3c as the sun (ZA), it becomes Light, itself, LUMINESCENT OUT OF THE %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 288 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c LUMINESCENT. Previously, its Light was solely the result of the inclusion of %0a%3c the properties of Higher Sefirot into it. %0a%3c %0a%3c Also, DOMINION OVER DOMINIONS, for during the 6,000 years, its %0a%3c reign was that of a small star, reigning only at night. Now, however, it also reigns %0a%3c during the day, for it is as big as the sun. %0a%3c %0a%3c 130. The hour when the Heaven (ZA) enters the Huppah and shines upon %0a%3c MalcHwt, all of her friends, who corrected her by studying the Torah, are %0a%3c known by their names, as it is said: "The Heavens declare the work of His %0a%3c hands." "The work of His hands" refers to the members of this covenant, %0a%3c called "the work of His hands." As you say: "Confirm for us the work of our %0a%3c hands," which is the mark of the covenant, imprinted on man's body. %0a%3c %0a%3c "Friends" are those who keep the Torah, which includes both good and %0a%3c evil deeds, even those parts of them that are still evil and uncorrected; EACH %0a%3c IS KNOWN BY A NAME (his corrected part), as it is said: THE HEAVENS %0a%3c DECLARE THE WORK OF HIS HANDS. "Heavens" is the Book of Remem- %0a%3c brance, which constitutes the Light of the great Zivug that leads to repentance %0a%3c (correction) out of love, when sins become merits (Talmud, Yoma, 86:2). %0a%3c %0a%3c And even those who were speaking ill things, it is said about them: "Then %0a%3c they shall impart their fear of the Creator upon one another" (item 126). %0a%3c Therefore, the action defined as "upholding the Torah," which includes both %0a%3c good (for the worthy) and evil (for the unworthy), now becomes completely %0a%3c good and holy. And it turns into THE WORK OF HIS HANDS-the Creator's %0a%3c actions, for THE HEAVENS SPEAK even of the unworthy. It turns out that all %0a%3c the friends have performed only good deeds and carried out holy work, for they %0a%3c would all correct Malchut, and ALL ARE KNOWN BY THEIR NAMES. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is therefore said: CONFIRM FOR US THE WORK OF OUR HANDS %0a%3c (Tehilim, 90:17). However, it is unclear whose hands are meant: His or ours? Only %0a%3c one thing is meant here— that the covenant is referred to as "the work of our hands," %0a%3c for its confirmation is Yesod (Yesod is not only the name of a Sefira, it also means %0a%3c "basis," "foundation" in Hebrew), the foundation of the entire construction. %0a%3c %0a%3c The correction of Yesod is Brit Milah (circumcision). Hence, it is said that %0a%3c the existence of the covenant is called "the work of our hands," for we separate %0a%3c the Orlah (foreskin) from Yesod through the work of our hands. But this only %0a%3c concerns the period up to the end of correction. And at the end of correction, %0a%3c THE WORK OF HIS HANDS will be revealed. In other words, the Creator %0a%3c Himself will detach the Orlah from us, and THE HEAVENS DECLARE THE %0a%3c WORK OF HIS HANDS. But until that state comes, we are entrusted with the %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Night of the Bride %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 289 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c correction of the circumcision. Therefore, we ask: CONFIRM FOR US THE %0a%3c WORK OF OUR HANDS. %0a%3c %0a%3c 131. Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba then said as follows: "Do not let your mouth cause %0a%3c your body to sin," i.e., one must not allow his mouth to get close to evil and be %0a%3c the cause of sin for the sacred flesh, which bears the mark of the holy covenant %0a%3c with the Creator. If he does so, he shall be dragged to hell. And the ruler of %0a%3c hell, called Domeh, stands at the gates of hell with hundreds of thousands of %0a%3c angels, but he is forbidden to approach those who have kept the holy covenant %0a%3c in this world. %0a%3c %0a%3c There is a warning here: let each man be careful of what he utters, so that %0a%3c his prayer is pure when he raises MAN with the help of the Torah and Mitzvot. %0a%3c If the impure force clings to his prayer, it will receive his MAN. As a result, %0a%3c man will develop a grudge against the Creator and foreign thoughts, thereby %0a%3c causing the Orlah to once again cling to the holy covenant. Consequently, %0a%3c his holy soul will fall into the captivity of the impure forces, and they will %0a%3c drag it to hell. This is similar to what Rabbi Elazar said about falling into %0a%3c Lilit's hands (item 68). %0a%3c %0a%3c THE SACRED FLESH, WHICH BEARS THE MARK OF THE HOLY %0a%3c COVENANT alludes to the holy soul guarded by the holy covenant, as it is said: %0a%3c "From my flesh I shall see the Creator," i.e., from my nature, my properties. Yet, %0a%3c doubts evoke the return of the impure force of the Orlah. It touches the holy %0a%3c covenant, and the Divine soul is instantly driven away. Hence, "The Tree cried %0a%3c out: Sinner, do not touch me," for this Tree is Yesod, Ateret Yesod (foreskin— the %0a%3c very essence of creation, egoism), the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. %0a%3c %0a%3c DOMEH, THE RULER OF HELL— DOMEH is derived from Dmamah- %0a%3c lifelessness, for he robs man of his soul and leaves him lifeless. This is the angel %0a%3c that fills man's heart with doubts regarding the Creator's greatness, and creates %0a%3c within him a sinful desire to perceive His plans as though they were plans of one %0a%3c born of a woman, i.e., as though they were of this world. And since he likens the %0a%3c Creator's thoughts in man's perception to those of man, he is named so (Domeh %0a%3c also means likeness, similarity). %0a%3c %0a%3c At first, man understands that the Creator's thoughts and ways are different %0a%3c from ours, for the created mind can grasp neither Him nor His thoughts nor %0a%3c His governance, as our mind is inferior to His. But, through sin, the angel %0a%3c Domeh plants a silly spirit within man, which forces him to say that the mind %0a%3c of one born of a woman is similar to the Creator's. This leaves man open to %0a%3c doubts, which DRAG HIM TO HELL. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 290 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, the power of the angel Domeh is in his name, as it is said: "Who %0a%3c is as mighty as You, who is LIKE You, the King that kills and resurrects?" This %0a%3c indicates that the connection with the one who is LIKE him leads to death, %0a%3c whereas in the realization that there is none like Him, man finds life. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, the doubts and thoughts that man receives from the angel Domeh %0a%3c are countless, as The Zohar says, HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF ANGELS %0a%3c ARE WITH HIM, and they are all standing at the gates of hell, through which %0a%3c man is dragged there, though the gates themselves are not yet considered hell. %0a%3c %0a%3c BUT HE (THE ANGEL) IS FORBIDDEN TO APPROACH THOSE %0a%3c WHO HAVE KEPT THE HOLY COVENANT IN THIS WORLD. And even if %0a%3c one did not fully keep (observe) the covenant, and there is still good and evil in %0a%3c his deeds, he is nonetheless regarded as one who has kept the holy covenant. So, %0a%3c unless one comes to doubt, the angel Domeh is forbidden to drag him to hell. %0a%3c %0a%3c 132. When this happened to King David, fear enveloped him. Right then, %0a%3c Domeh ascended before the Creator, and said: "Master of the world, it says in %0a%3c the To rah (Vayikra, 20:10): 'And the man that commits adultery with another %0a%3c man's wife...' David broke his covenant, is it not so?" The Creator replied to %0a%3c him: "David is righteous, and his holy covenant remains pure, for it is known %0a%3c to Me that Bat Sheva was destined for him since the creation of the world." %0a%3c %0a%3c Although David committed no sin, as the Talmud explains (Shabbat, 56: 1) that %0a%3c he who says that David sinned is wrong, he was enveloped with fear nonetheless, %0a%3c as if he really had sinned, for Domeh cited the Torah in his complaint. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, Bat Sheva had been destined for David since the creation of the %0a%3c world (Talmud, Sanhedrin, 107:1); thus, he did not violate his covenant. Yet, if Bat %0a%3c Sheva had been destined for David, why was she first married to Uriah? After all, %0a%3c a wife is half of her husband's body. And if she is half of David's body, how could %0a%3c Uriah have taken her, if there is nothing in him that corresponds with her? %0a%3c %0a%3c The fact is that Bat Sheva is David's true Nukva (female) from the day of the %0a%3c creation of the world, for David is the male part of Malchut, while Bat Sheva %0a%3c is the Nukva in Malchut. But since, as the world was being created, Malchut %0a%3c ascended to Bina to receive the property of mercy (bestowal) from her, Bat Sheva, %0a%3c too, required this correction in GAR. Without it she could not have given birth %0a%3c to the soul of King Solomon. %0a%3c %0a%3c And Uriah the Hittite was an exalted soul, the properties of GAR, wherefrom %0a%3c the name "Uriah," which consists of Ur = Ohr (Light) and i(a)h = i (Yod) + h (Hey) = %0a%3c the first two letters of the Creator's Name HaVaYaH, is derived. In other words, %0a%3c Uriah signifies "the Creator's Light." And the fact that his name contains only %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Night of the Bride %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 291 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c the first two letters Yod-Hey = Hochma-Bina, and lacks the last two letters Vav- %0a%3c Hey = ZA-Malchut indicates that his Light is the Light of GAR. Therefore, to %0a%3c correct Bat Sheva in the property of mercy, she was joined with Uriah. As a %0a%3c result, she became fit for queenship, and became the Queen of Israel. %0a%3c %0a%3c 133. Domeh said to Him: "Master of the World, what is revealed to You is %0a%3c concealed from him." The Creator answered: "Whatever David did was done %0a%3c with My permission. For no man goes to war without first giving his wife a get %0a%3c (document of divorce)." Domeh then said: "But if this is so, David should have %0a%3c waited three months, which he did not." The Creator replied: "This extension %0a%3c is only necessary to make certain that the woman is not pregnant from her %0a%3c previous husband. But it is known to Me that Uriah never went near her, for %0a%3c My Name is imprinted in him as testimony. Indeed, Uriah is Ohr'lah, the %0a%3c Creator's Light, though it is written Uriahu = Ohr + i + a + hu (Yod-Hey-Vav), %0a%3c without the last Hey, MalcHut, which proves that he did not use Malcfutt." %0a%3c %0a%3c The letters Yod-Hey in Uriah's name (Aleph-Reish-Yod-Hey) indicate that he %0a%3c had never touched Bat Sheva. This is because Uriah refers to GAR without %0a%3c VAK. And The Zohar emphasizes that whenever VAK is used, the name Uriahu %0a%3c is applied. However, it is written here that Uriah was Bat Sheva's first husband, %0a%3c meaning that he had nothing of VAK in him, but only GAR— the Light of Hochma %0a%3c without the Light of Hassadim, for Vav signifies Hassadim. This is why he could %0a%3c not come near Bath Sheba. %0a%3c %0a%3c 134. Domeh said to Him: "Master of the World, this is exactly what I have %0a%3c said: if You knew that Uriah had never laid with her, then who revealed it to %0a%3c David? He should have waited three months. And if You will say that David %0a%3c knew that Uriah had never laid with her, why did he send Uriah to his wife, %0a%3c saying: 'Go down to your house, and wash your feet?'" %0a%3c %0a%3c Usually the readers of the To rah give this example of "a love triangle %0a%3c evidence of King David's less than exalted qualities and of the inconsistent %0a%3c the Creator's judgment— how He forgave David for "killing" Uriah, and so forth. %0a%3c We must remember that the Torah speaks only of the spiritual worlds and their %0a%3c laws, which have no obvious consequences in our world. There is a cause-and- %0a%3c effect connection: whatever occurs in our world is a result of a Higher cause, but %0a%3c no way is it vice versa, i.e., whatever is described in the Upper World does not %0a%3c sarily need to manifest in ours. To consider the Torah a narrative abo %0a%3c relegates the Torah of the world of Atzilut, the Creator's holy na: %0a%3c the Creator's Light, to the lowest level of creation, which is strictly forbid %0a%3c "Do not make an idol for yourself." %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c le" as %0a%3c icy of %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ibout %0a%3c im e S , %0a%3c Iden: %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 292 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 135. He replied to him: "Of course, David did not know, but he waited more %0a%3c than three months, as four months had passed." As we have learned, on the %0a%3c 15 th day of Nissan, David ordered all the people of Israel to prepare for war, %0a%3c Yoav— on seventh day of Nissan. They conquered the lands of Moav and %0a%3c remained there for four months, until he went to Bat Sheva in the month %0a%3c of Elul. And on Yom Kippur, the Creator forgave him his sin. But there are %0a%3c those who say that David dispatched his orders on the seventh day of Adar, %0a%3c the troops assembled on the 15 th day of lyar, he went to Bat Sheva on the %0a%3c 15 th day of Elul, and on Yom Kippur the Creator forgave him and spared him %0a%3c from death at the hands of the angel Domeh. %0a%3c %0a%3c Domeh is in charge of adultery. And since David was forgiven on the Day of %0a%3c Atonement, he thereby escaped death at the hands of Domeh. However, death %0a%3c was a consequence of Uriah's death at the hands of Amon's sons, as is recorded %0a%3c in the book of Kings (Melachim, 1, 15:5), "For David did that which was right in %0a%3c the eyes of the Lord, and turned not aside from anything that He commanded %0a%3c him all the days of his life, save only in the matter of Uriah the Hittite." %0a%3c %0a%3c 136. Domeh said: "Master of the World, I have nonetheless one claim %0a%3c against him: why did he open his mouth and say: 'The Lord is righteous, %0a%3c for a mortal does so,' thus condemning himself to death. Hence, I have the %0a%3c power to bring death upon him." The Creator replied to him: "You are %0a%3c not allowed to bring death upon him, for he has repented and confessed: 'I %0a%3c have sinned before the Creator,' even though he did not sin. But he did sin %0a%3c in one matter— the killing of Uriah. I have recorded his punishment, and %0a%3c he had received it." Then Domeh immediately gave up his complaints, and %0a%3c returned, despondent, to his place. %0a%3c %0a%3c The last letter Hey in the name HaVaYaH has two points— restriction %0a%3c (strictness) and mercy. And all the corrections of Malchut with the help of the %0a%3c covenant (circumcision) are intended to conceal strictness and reveal mercy. %0a%3c Then, the Creator's name descends into Malchut. Even though Malchut exists %0a%3c there under the ban of the first restriction (strictness and judgment), and all %0a%3c the impure forces cling onto her, this point is nonetheless concealed, and only %0a%3c Bina's property of mercy is revealed. Thus, the impure forces-desires, which are %0a%3c foreign to holiness and spirituality, are powerless and cannot cling to her. %0a%3c %0a%3c To violate the covenant means to reveal the strictness and judgment in %0a%3c Malchut (the letter Hey). As a result, the impure forces immediately cling to her, for %0a%3c this is their property— a part of them. The holy soul, the Creator's name, thereby %0a%3c disappears at once, as it is written (lyov, 4:9): "By the breath of God they perish." %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Night of the Bride %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 293 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c David himself is the part of Malchut related to Malchut's property of mercy. %0a%3c Hence, he requires special care so as to prevent Malchut's property of strictness %0a%3c from being revealed in him. For he who reveals the property of strictness and %0a%3c violates the covenant with the Creator, surrenders himself to the impure forces, %0a%3c which condemn him to death. This is because the property of strictness reveals %0a%3c itself within him before the impure force (the angel Domeh), who wished to %0a%3c cling to David's soul and drag it to hell. %0a%3c %0a%3c Although he was innocent, David begged the Creator's forgiveness for adultery, %0a%3c and received it. But with regard to David sending Uriah to his death, Domeh had %0a%3c no right to ask the Creator for punishment, as he is only in charge of adultery. %0a%3c %0a%3c 137. And David said to this: "Were it not for the Creator's help, Domeh had %0a%3c nearly claimed my soul." "Were it not for the Creator's help" means "had the %0a%3c Creator not been my guard and guide against the angel Domeh." "Nearly" %0a%3c means that only the distance as thin as a thread remained for Domeh to drag %0a%3c my soul to hell. %0a%3c %0a%3c David is Malchut, of whom it is written (Mishley, 5:5): "Her feet descend to %0a%3c death," for she is the end, conclusion of holiness (the spiritual). The impure %0a%3c forces originate in Malchut, and she sustains them, as it is said (Tehilim, 103:19): %0a%3c "His kingdom rules over all." %0a%3c %0a%3c However, when Malchut exists in her corrected property of mercy (item 122), %0a%3c she is defined as consisting of two points: her own point of judgment and the %0a%3c point of mercy that she received from Bina. Her point of judgment is concealed, %0a%3c while the point of mercy is revealed. And thanks to this correction, all that the %0a%3c impure forces can get from Malchut is a Ner Dakik (tiny luminescence), which %0a%3c only sustains their existence, but does not allow for their spreading. %0a%3c %0a%3c Ner Dakik, the source of existence for the impure forces, is also known as %0a%3c Hoteh Dakik, a small sin, the root of sins, as it is written (Talmud, Sukkah, 52:1): %0a%3c "Initially, the impure force seems as thin as a spider web, but then grows as %0a%3c thick as a shaft." And it is called small (Dakik), for judgment and restrictions are %0a%3c concealed within the property (point) of mercy. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, he who violates the covenant causes the point of judgment in %0a%3c Malchut to be revealed. As a result, the impure forces cling to Malchut and draw %0a%3c much Light from her, thus receiving the strength to spread and expand. And he %0a%3c who does so is said to be forsaking his own soul, as it is written: "By the breath %0a%3c of God they perish" (lyov, 4:9). %0a%3c %0a%3c And when he merits returning to the Creator, he returns and corrects %0a%3c Malchut with the property of mercy. This is why this process is called Teshuva %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 294 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c (return), from the word of Tashuv (to return) + "A," where "A" (Hey) designates %0a%3c the Creator. In other words, it is the return to the property of mercy, whereas %0a%3c the property of judgment goes back to being concealed in the property of mercy, %0a%3c like a small candle, and nothing more. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is therefore written: WERE IT NOT FOR THE CREATOR'S HELP, %0a%3c referring to His acceptance of my return and repelling the angel Domeh by %0a%3c bringing Malchut back to her place (to the property) of mercy, reducing the %0a%3c property of judgment to a mere small candle, a hair's-breadth fire, whose LIGHT %0a%3c SEPARATES ME FROM THE IMPURE FORCE. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is that minimal Light that must always remain between Malchut and %0a%3c the impure force, so as to allow Malchut to exist and be sustained by this small %0a%3c Light, called "small sin," so small that DOMEH WOULD NOT DRAG MY %0a%3c SOUL TO HELL FOR IT. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is precisely the magnitude of this Light that saved me from the hands %0a%3c of Domeh, for had the property of judgment not returned to Malchut in the %0a%3c measure of a small sin, I would have fallen into the hands of Domeh. %0a%3c %0a%3c 138. Therefore, man should be careful not to say what David said, for one %0a%3c cannot say to the angel Domeh that "It was an error" (Kohelet, 5:5), as it was %0a%3c with David, when the Creator won the dispute against Domeh. "Why should %0a%3c the Creator be angry over your word" (Kohelet, 5:5), i.e., for what you have %0a%3c said. "Destroyed the work of your hands" (Kohelet, 5:5) i.e., the sacred flesh, %0a%3c the holy covenant, which you have broken, and are therefore to be dragged to %0a%3c hell by the angel Domeh. %0a%3c %0a%3c There are two ways to return to the Creator ("Introduction to the Study of %0a%3c the Ten Sefirot," items 45, 59, 64; Talmud, Yoma, 86:2): %0a%3c %0a%3c 1) Repentance out of fear, when intentional sins become unintentional, %0a%3c %0a%3c 2) Repentance out of love, when intentional sins become merits. %0a%3c %0a%3c Before the end of correction, when the forces of strictness, restriction, and %0a%3c judgment are still needed in the world, as it is written (Kohelet, 3:14), "The %0a%3c Creator hath so made it that man should fear Him," Malchut must sustain the %0a%3c existence of the impure forces as Ner Dakik, so they will not disappear from %0a%3c the world. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, at such a time (in this state), Malchut's corrections are made in %0a%3c two points: mercy and judgment. However, judgment is concealed, while mercy %0a%3c acts openly. This is why the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil is feared: if %0a%3c man is worthy— it is good, if not— it is evil (items 120-124). %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Night of the Bride %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 295 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, DURING THE 6,000 YEARS, WE RETURN TO THE %0a%3c CREATOR ONLY OUT OF FEAR, which causes our intentional sins to turn %0a%3c into unintentional ones— errors. As a result of our repentance, we bring Malchut %0a%3c back to the property of mercy. But strictness and judgment are concealed in her %0a%3c to the extent of a small candle (small sin), since Malchut must still remain in the %0a%3c property of fear. Hence, this return is called "the return out of fear." %0a%3c %0a%3c The small sin that must remain is also called "unintentional sin," an "error," %0a%3c a "mistake," for it is not regarded as a sin in and of itself. Rather, it only leads %0a%3c man to commit an unintentional sin. Man sins intentionally only after having %0a%3c first committed an unintentional sin: he committed something unintentionally, %0a%3c but it turned out that he has sinned. %0a%3c %0a%3c Thus, this small sin remains in Malchut, but although it remains, it is not %0a%3c really considered a sin. Yet, through this concealed judgment and strictness %0a%3c we come to intentional sins. This is why it is said: "Initially, it is as a hair's- %0a%3c breadth," i.e., like a small sin. But then, unless we properly guard our covenant, %0a%3c it "becomes as thick as a shaft," as the property of strictness and judgment %0a%3c becomes revealed in Malchut. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is hence said that Domeh stands at the gates of hell, as the power of a %0a%3c small sin is only an entrance, for it is said that it looks as thin as a spider web. %0a%3c Therefore, our repentance is called "forgiven sins," which turn into unintentional %0a%3c errors, as though they were mistakes. For a small sin remains, which is capable %0a%3c of leading us to intentional sins. %0a%3c %0a%3c All this refers to the repentance out of fear, whereas the second kind is the %0a%3c repentance out of love, when intentional sins turn to merits (item 126). %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, MAN SHOULD BE CAREFUL NOT TO SAY WHAT DAVID %0a%3c SAID, i.e., not to utter the word that causes the property of judgment in Malchut %0a%3c to be revealed (as David had done). FOR ONE CANNOT SAY TO THE ANGEL %0a%3c DOMEH THAT IT WAS AN ERROR, for he is unsure as to whether he can %0a%3c return to the Creator right away, so that his sin would be forgiven and made %0a%3c unintentional, AS IT WAS WITH DAVID, WHEN THE CREATOR WON %0a%3c THE DISPUTE AGAINST DOMEH. %0a%3c %0a%3c It happened with David because throughout his life all of his actions before %0a%3c the Creator were pure, he had committed no crimes, and the only exception was %0a%3c his act toward Uriah. Hence, the Creator became his defender, and helped him %0a%3c return to Him at once, and his sin was turned into an error, as it is said in The %0a%3c Zohar (item 137): WERE IT NOT FOR THE CREATOR'S HELP, DOMEH %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 296 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c HAD NEARLY CLAIMED MY SOUL. But other people should fear this angel, %0a%3c for an unintentional sin may lead them to hell at the hands of Domeh. %0a%3c %0a%3c DESTROYED THE WORK OF YOUR HANDS, THE SACRED FLESH, %0a%3c THE HOLY COVENANT, WHICH YOU HAVE VIOLATED, AND ARE %0a%3c THEREFORE TO BE DRAGGED TO HELL BY THE ANGEL DOMEH. %0a%3c The correction in us called "the holy covenant" is regarded as "the work of %0a%3c our hands," as it is written: "Confirm the work of our hands." The holy soul %0a%3c is called the sacred flesh, as it is said, "Out of my flesh shall I see the Creator" %0a%3c (lyov, 19:26) (item 131). Because of the revelation of the property of strictness %0a%3c and judgment in Malchut, the correction of the covenant was corrupted, and %0a%3c Domeh drags the soul to hell. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, THE HEAVENS DECLARE THE WORK OF HIS HANDS %0a%3c (item 130). In the end of correction, the Heavens will declare the work of His %0a%3c hands, as the reward for all these corrections will be revealed. It will become %0a%3c clear that this was THE WORK OF HIS HANDS, and NOT OURS', and THE %0a%3c HEAVENS DECLARE this. And the great Zivug RAV PAALIM U MEKABTZIEL %0a%3c will be made on these actions (corrections) (item 92). DECLARE refers to the %0a%3c Light's descent from Above. %0a%3c %0a%3c Know that this is the only difference in our world before and after the end of %0a%3c correction. Before the end of correction, Malchut is called the Tree of Knowledge %0a%3c of Good and Evil, for Malchut is the revelation of the Creator's governance over %0a%3c this world. And until people achieve the state where they can receive His Light %0a%3c (as He conceived and prepared for everyone back at the Thought of Creation), %0a%3c the world will be ruled by good and evil, by reward and punishment. %0a%3c %0a%3c The reason for this is that our Kelim de Kabbalah (vessels of reception) are %0a%3c impure, stained by egoism, which (i) prevents the Creator's Light from filling %0a%3c theses desires, and (ii) separates us from the Creator. And the infinite goodness %0a%3c that He has prepared for us may only be received in altruistic desires, for these %0a%3c delights are not limited by the bounds of creation, like egoistic pleasures, in %0a%3c which fulfillment instantly douses the pleasure. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, it is written: "The Creator hath made everything for His own glory" %0a%3c (Mishley, 16:4), i.e., all the deeds in the world were initially created by Him %0a%3c so that we could please Him. Therefore, people in our world are engaged in %0a%3c things that are totally opposite from what they should be doing, according to the %0a%3c purpose of their creation. After all, the Creator clearly states that He created the %0a%3c world for Himself: "I have created it for My glory" (Yeshayahu, 43:7). %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Night of the Bride %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 297 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Yet, we claim the exact opposite— that the whole world was created for us, %0a%3c and we desire to swallow it whole, for our own pleasure, satisfaction, indulgence, %0a%3c and exaltation. So it is no surprise we are unworthy of receiving the Creator's %0a%3c perfect goodness. And thus He rules over us through good and evil, in the %0a%3c form of reward and punishment, for one depends on the other: reward and %0a%3c punishment give rise to good and evil. %0a%3c %0a%3c Because we use our desires to receive (pleasure), thus becoming opposite %0a%3c m the Creator, we perceive His governance towards us as evil. This stems fn %0a%3c at man cannot perceive obvious evil from the Creator, as this w %0a%3c dermine the creatures' perception of the great and perfect Creator, fo %0a%3c one cannot create evil. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, to the extent that man feels bad and evil, and denies the Divine %0a%3c Providence, a veil immediately falls over him, and the sensation of the Creator's %0a%3c existence disappears. This is the worst punishment in the world! %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, the sensation of good and evil in the Creator's governance gives us %0a%3c a feeling of reward and punishment. This is because he who exerts efforts not to %0a%3c lose faith in the Creator's existence and governance, even if he tastes evil in His %0a%3c governance, is rewarded with finding strength to not lose faith in the governance %0a%3c and good purpose of the Creator's "evil" influence. But if he had not yet merited %0a%3c the opportunity to exert efforts in believing that the Creator pursues a definite %0a%3c purpose by sending him unpleasant sensations, he is punished with remoteness %0a%3c from faith in the Creator and the sensation of His existence. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, although He has done, is doing, and will do all the deeds in the %0a%3c world, it remains semi-concealed from those who perceive both good and evil. %0a%3c For when they perceive evil, the impure force is allowed to conceal the Creator's %0a%3c governance and faith in Him. Thus, man suffers the worst punishment in the %0a%3c world— the sensation of detachment from the Creator— and becomes filled with %0a%3c doubts and denial of the Creator's existence and governance. And when he %0a%3c returns to the Creator, he receives a corresponding reward, and is able to unite %0a%3c with Him once again. %0a%3c %0a%3c But through this very governance of reward and punishment, the Creator %0a%3c has prepared for us the opportunity to utilize this governance in order to achieve %0a%3c the end of correction, when all people attain their corrected Kelim (desires), and %0a%3c use them to bring pleasure to the Creator, as it is written that He has created %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Then the great Zivug of Atik will be revealed, we will all return to the Creator %0a%3c out of love, all our intentional sins will turn to merits, all evil will be felt as %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 298 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c infinite goodness, and His Divine Providence will be revealed in the entire %0a%3c world. Thus, ALL SHALL SEE that only He has done, is doing, and will do all %0a%3c the deeds in the world, and that no one acts besides Him. After the sensation of %0a%3c evil and punishment is turned to one of goodness and reward, and our egoistic %0a%3c desires become altruistic, we are given the opportunity to attain the Maker, for %0a%3c we conform to the work of His hands by blessing and exalting Him above all evil %0a%3c and all punishments we had once suffered. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, the most important point to stress here is that until the end %0a%3c of correction, all the corrections were considered as THE WORK OF OUR %0a%3c HANDS. This is why we receive rewards or punishments for them. But in the %0a%3c great Zivug at the end of correction, it will be revealed that all the corrections %0a%3c and all the punishments are THE WORK OF HIS HANDS. %0a%3c %0a%3c Thus, it is said, THE HEAVENS DECLARE THE WORK OF HIS HANDS. %0a%3c This is because the great Zivug signifies what the Heavens will declare, that all %0a%3c the deeds are the work of His hands, that He has done, is doing, and will do all %0a%3c the deeds in the whole of creation. %0a%3c %0a%3c 139. Thus, "the Heavens declare the work of His hands." These are the friends %0a%3c who have united in the bride (Malchut) by studying the Torah on the night %0a%3c of the holiday of Shavuot. They are all participants of the covenant with her, %0a%3c and are called "the work of His hands." And she praises and notes each and %0a%3c every one of them. What is Heaven, firmament? It is the firmament, where %0a%3c the sun, the moon, the stars, and the zodiac are located. This firmament is %0a%3c called the Book of Remembrance, and it declares and records them, so they %0a%3c shall become the sons of His palace, and He will fulfill all their desires. %0a%3c %0a%3c Yesod of Zeir Anpin, onto which a Zivug is made for the revelation of all %0a%3c the Supernal Degrees, called the sun, the moon, the stars, and the signs of the %0a%3c zodiac, is referred to as the "firmament." All of the Supernal stars exist on the %0a%3c firmament, called Yesod of Zeir Anpin. And everything exists thanks to it, for it %0a%3c makes a Zivug with Nukva, called earth, and shines upon her with all these stars, %0a%3c i.e., gives these stars to her. %0a%3c %0a%3c It turns out that Malchut is smaller than the sun (ZA). But at the end of %0a%3c correction, the light of the moon will be as the light of the sun, and the light %0a%3c of the sun will be seventy times greater than before— Malchut will become as %0a%3c big as Zeir Anpin during the six days of creation. When will this be? Rabbi %0a%3c Yehuda answers: on the day when death disappears forever, and the Creator %0a%3c and His Name are as one. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Night of the Bride %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 299 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Heaven or the firmament (ZA) is HaVaYaH, called "the sun." Malchut %0a%3c (Nukva) receives from it, and is called "the moon." During the 6,000 years, %0a%3c Malchut receives the Light from the six days of creation, but Zeir Anpin does not %0a%3c reveal that the Creator and His Name are one. Hence, the moon is smaller than %0a%3c the sun. Its lesser size is a result of Malchut's consisting of both good and evil, %0a%3c reward and punishment. %0a%3c %0a%3c There is a considerable difference between "Him" and "His Name." "His %0a%3c Name" is Malchut, where all the Zivugim, and all the states of unification and %0a%3c separation are accumulated. But at the end of correction, when death is said to %0a%3c disappear forever, HaVaYaH and His Name will be one. The Name (Malchut) %0a%3c will be like the Light of Zeir Anpin— only goodness without evil, and the private %0a%3c governance will be revealed in her, which means that the light of the moon will %0a%3c become equal to that of the sun. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore at this time (in this state), Nukva will be called "the Book of %0a%3c Remembrance," for all human deeds are recorded in her. Yesod of Zeir Anpin is %0a%3c called "remembrance," for it remembers the deeds of the entire world, studies, %0a%3c and analyzes all the creatures that receive from it. %0a%3c %0a%3c During the 6,000 years before the end of correction, the Book of %0a%3c Remembrance exists sometimes together and sometimes separately. But at the %0a%3c end of correction, these two degrees will merge into one, and Malchut herself %0a%3c will be called "the Book of Remembrance," when ZA and Malchut become a %0a%3c single whole, for Malchut's Light will equal that of ZA. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, the firmament is a place where the sun, the moon, the stars, %0a%3c and the signs of the zodiac are located. The firmament is Yesod of ZA, which %0a%3c emanates all the Light of the world and sustains all existence. It passes the Light %0a%3c onto Malchut when she is smaller than it, and the state, "He and His Name are %0a%3c one" has not yet been achieved. And at the end of correction, it will be exactly %0a%3c like Malchut, who is hence called the Book of Remembrance. %0a%3c %0a%3c Thus, when Malchut receives all the properties of Zeir Anpin (the firmament, %0a%3c called "Remembrance"), she will become the Book of Remembrance, i.e., she %0a%3c and the firmament will be one. %0a%3c %0a%3c 140. Day after day brings Omer— a sheaf. The holy day out of those days %0a%3c (Sefirot) of the King (Zeir Anpin) praises the friends, who study the Torah %0a%3c on the night of Shavuot. They say to each other, "Day after day shall bring %0a%3c a sheaf," and praise it. And the words "night after night" refer to all the %0a%3c degrees, Sefirot of Malchut, that reign in the night, praise one another by %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 300 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c each receiving from a friend, from another Sefira. And the state of complete %0a%3c perfection makes them beloved friends. %0a%3c %0a%3c Having explained that THE HEAVENS DECLARE THE WORK OF HIS %0a%3c HANDS is THE BOOK OF REMEMBRANCE. The Zohar continues to clarify the %0a%3c writings in the Book ofMalachi (3:14-16): "You have said, 'How futile it is to serve %0a%3c the Creator! When we carried out the Creator's will, and walked heavy-hearted %0a%3c before Him— what is the use of it all? And now we regard the wicked as blessed: %0a%3c they have settled in their wickedness, tried the Creator, and were liberated.' Then %0a%3c those who feared the Creator spoke WITH EACH OTHER, and the Creator %0a%3c hearkened and heard, and a BOOK OF REMEMBRANCE was recorded before %0a%3c Him for those who fear the Creator (every day) and honor His (holy) name. %0a%3c And they shall become chosen for Me,'— the Lord said,— 'on the day that I shall %0a%3c determine, and I shall spare them, as a man spares his son, who serves him,— on %0a%3c the day that I shall work a miracle, on the day of the end of correction.'" %0a%3c %0a%3c Before the end of correction, before we prepare our desires "to receive" only %0a%3c for the Creator's sake, and not for self-gratification, Malchut is called "The Tree %0a%3c of Knowledge of Good and Evil," for Malchut governs the world in accordance %0a%3c with man's deeds. Inasmuch as we are not yet ready to receive all the delight that %0a%3c the Creator prepared for us in His Thought of Creation, we have no choice but %0a%3c to submit to Malchut's governance of good and evil. %0a%3c %0a%3c And this very governance prepares us for the eventual correction of our %0a%3c desires to receive (Kelim de Kabbalah) into desires for bestowal (Kelim de Hashpaa), %0a%3c thus achieving the goodness and delight that He conceived to bestow upon us. %0a%3c %0a%3c As was previously stated, the sensation of good and evil creates in us a %0a%3c feeling of reward and punishment. Therefore, when one tries to retain his faith %0a%3c in the Creator while he is feeling evil, but still continues to observe the Torah %0a%3c and Mitzvot as he did before, he is rewarded. %0a%3c %0a%3c And if he cannot overcome this test and is distanced from the Creator, he %0a%3c becomes filled with doubts with regard to the good governance. Alternatively, he %0a%3c stops believing that the Creator governs the world altogether, or feels resentment %0a%3c towards the Creator in response to these unpleasant sensations. The Creator pun- %0a%3c ishes for all thoughts, just as He does for all actions (Talmud, Kidushim, 40:1). %0a%3c %0a%3c It is also said that one's righteousness is of no help to him on the day of his %0a%3c sin. But sometimes man's doubts are so overpowering that he regrets even the %0a%3c good deeds he had previously done, and says (Malachi, 3:14): "You have said, %0a%3c 'How futile it is to serve the Creator! When we carried out the Creator's will, %0a%3c and walked heavy-hearted before Him— what is the use of it all?'" He becomes %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Night of the Bride %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 301 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c a complete sinner, who regrets his righteous past (complaining that he wasted %0a%3c time and effort instead of enjoying this world like the others!), and his doubts %0a%3c and regrets cause him to lose all of his good deeds, as the Torah warns us: %0a%3c "One's righteousness is of no help to him on the day of his sin." %0a%3c %0a%3c Yet, even in this state, man can return to the Creator. However, he is said %0a%3c to be beginning on his path anew, as though he is a newborn, for all of his past %0a%3c good deeds are gone. %0a%3c %0a%3c One should not take the aforesaid literally, even in its spiritual context, for %0a%3c he who works to achieve unconditional altruistic deeds constantly experiences %0a%3c descents and ascents, is filled with doubts, and tries to overcome them. Only %0a%3c one who advances in this manner feels that he is starting his work every time %0a%3c anew, that he understands no more than a newborn baby. Conversely, one who %0a%3c belongs to the masses— who works in his egoistic desires— is constantly filled with %0a%3c self-reverence and thinks that on each new day, he adds to the previous one, and %0a%3c nothing seems to disappear. This makes his spiritual growth impossible. %0a%3c %0a%3c Only one who truly ascends the spiritual degrees feels like a newborn baby %0a%3c before his Creator at each moment. After all, as he ascends from one degree to %0a%3c the next, the previous state (degree) disappears, and until he attains a Higher %0a%3c Degree, he is in total darkness and feels that he is starting from scratch, rather %0a%3c than supplementing his assets, which is how the spiritually inanimate (Domem %0a%3c de Kedusha) feel. %0a%3c %0a%3c The governance of good and evil causes us to ascend and descend— each in %0a%3c his own way... Each ascent is considered a separate day (sensation of Light). As a %0a%3c result of the great descent that he has just undergone by regretting his past good %0a%3c deeds, man moves into a state of ascent, as one who is born anew. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, at each ascent, it is as though one starts over on his path to the %0a%3c Creator. Thus, each ascent is regarded as a separate day, for there is a break (night) %0a%3c between these states. And each descent is hence considered a separate night. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is what The Zohar tells us: DAY AFTER DAY SHALL BRING A %0a%3c SHEAF— in each ascent we draw nearer to the Creator's greatest day (the end %0a%3c of correction), HE PRAISED THE FRIENDS AND THEY WOULD SPEAK %0a%3c WITH EACH OTHER. This is because through the great Zivug at the end of %0a%3c correction, they will all merit returning to the Creator out of love, for the desire %0a%3c "to receive" will be completely corrected, and they will begin to receive only for %0a%3c the Creator's sake, so as to bestow delight upon Him. %0a%3c %0a%3c In this great Zivug (unity), we will reveal all the supreme goodness and %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c delight of the Thought of Creation. And we will tl %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c th %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 302 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c its would %0a%3c he direct %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c lose punishments we experienced in the states of descent, which %0a%3c t and regret the efforts exerted in the Torah, all those punishments %0a%3c rrect and purify us. And now, at the end of correction, they are the %0a%3c se for our sensation and reception of the Creator's goodness. %0a%3c %0a%3c Had it not been for the terrible suffering and punishments, we would not %0a%3c have been able to achieve the state of being filled with perfect delight. Therefore, %0a%3c even these intentional sins turn into merits, as it is said: DAY AFTER DAY %0a%3c ULL BRING A SHEAF— each ascent in Malchut, up to the end of correction, %0a%3c %0a%3c This day is revealed by the word, which supports the Torah in all its greatness. %0a%3c What is this word? When they say, "How futile it is to serve the Creator! When %0a%3c we carried out the Creator's will, and walked heavy-hearted before Him— what %0a%3c is the use of it all?" %0a%3c %0a%3c These words brought punishments that have now become merits, for all %0a%3c the perfection and magnificence of that great day can now be revealed thanks %0a%3c to these very punishments of the past. Thus, those who uttered these words are %0a%3c now regarded as those who fear the Creator and praise His Name. (And these %0a%3c words could only have been spoken by those who made efforts to advance on %0a%3c the Path of Truth, and felt frustrated upon receiving uncorrected egoism of a %0a%3c Higher Degree. In other words, frustration comes only to those who truly work %0a%3c for the Creator's sake.) %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, it is said about them: "The Lord said, 'On the day that I shall %0a%3c determine, and I shall spare them, as a man spares his son, who serves him,'" %0a%3c for all the nights— states of descent, suffering and punishments, which sever %0a%3c their connection with the Creator— now become merits and good deeds. And %0a%3c the night turns into day, darkness turns into Light, and there are no divisions %0a%3c between days, and all 6,000 years gather into one great day. %0a%3c %0a%3c And all the Zivugim that were made one after another, revealed the ascents %0a%3c and the separate, consecutive degrees, have now gathered into one degree of %0a%3c one great Zivug— Unity, which shines in the world from end to end. Hence, it %0a%3c is written: DAY AFTER DAY SHALL BRING A SHEAF, that is, the intervals %0a%3c between days now become magnificent glory, for they have been turned into %0a%3c merits. Thus, everything becomes the Creator's one glorious day! %0a%3c %0a%3c And the words "night after night" refer to all the degrees that reign in the %0a%3c night. They praise one another, and each receives everything that man feels as %0a%3c suffering in a state of descent— this is called night. And through such sensations, %0a%3c intervals are formed between the sensations of day. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Night of the Bride %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 303 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c , now %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c the whole, each degree is separated from one another. Night %0a%3c to attain the Creator. And while each night is full of darkness, %0a%3c all the nights (states of feeling emptiness, hopelessness, heaviness of efforts, the %0a%3c Creator's concealment) gather together and form a unified vessel of reception %0a%3c of Supernal wisdom, which fills the entire earth with Knowledge of the Creator, %0a%3c and the nights shine like days. %0a%3c %0a%3c For each night receives its own part of Knowledge only by joining with the %0a%3c ther nights. Thus, each night is said to help the other nights in the Knowledge, %0a%3c differently, man is ready to receive the Knowledge only if he joins with th %0a%3c nights. %0a%3c %0a%3c And since night is a feeling of lacking knowledge, attainment, and sensation %0a%3c )f the Creator by uniting, they form a perfect vessel of reception of the Knowledge %0a%3c of the Creator. And they praise one another, for each has received his share of %0a%3c the Knowledge of the Creator thanks exclusively to his friend, through uniting %0a%3c 1. Only in unity do they merit reception of the Supernal Knowledge, %0a%3c aid that through the perfection achieved by all, the nights becam%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 141. Does he speak of the others in the world who do not obey the Creator, %0a%3c and whom He does not wish to hear? But they made lines through all the %0a%3c earth, that is, these things make a line out of those that reside Above and out %0a%3c of those that reside below. From the first— firmaments are made, and from the %0a%3c second, from their return— earth. And should you say that they revolve around %0a%3c the earth in one place, it is said that they are also at the end of the world. %0a%3c %0a%3c Thus far, we have discussed the most terrible punishments and suffering in %0a%3c the world— being detached from the Creator and losing faith in Him. Moreover, %0a%3c The Zohar tells us that all the punishments, all the suffering of hell and of the %0a%3c body, which stem from personal sins and fill this world, also gather and are %0a%3c included into one great Zivug, as it is written: "And it shall come to pass, that as %0a%3c the Lord rejoiced over you to do you good, and to multiply you; so the Lord will %0a%3c rejoice over you to cause you to perish, and to destroy you" (Devarim, 28:63). %0a%3c %0a%3c All will gather and become one great Light, and everything will turn to %0a%3c great joy and bliss. It is therefore said that THERE IS NO SHEAF AND NO %0a%3c THINGS IN THE OTHER WORDS OF THE WORLD, which man perceives %0a%3c in this world as suffering. But they will turn to joy and bliss, and thus the holy %0a%3c King, too, shall wish to hear them. %0a%3c %0a%3c So, all the suffering during the 6,000 years will gather at the end of correction %0a%3c and will become a tremendous delight, as the prophet said: "In those days and %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 304 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c in that time, said the Lord, even if the iniquity of Israel shall be sought for, there %0a%3c shall be none" (Yirmiyahu, 50:20). %0a%3c %0a%3c Everything will turn to merits, so much so that they will ask and search "for %0a%3c the past sins that can be included in the Zivug, and which can be laughed at, %0a%3c for they were felt as suffering and now they are joy and bliss," but they will not %0a%3c find any. There will be no more suffering in its true form, as it was in the past, %0a%3c although they greatly desire to find it and feel it, for all suffering will have now %0a%3c been turned to great Light. %0a%3c %0a%3c This Supernal Degree, created by the great Zivug out of all the souls and all %0a%3c the deeds, both good and evil, is now defined as a pillar of Light, which shines %0a%3c from one end of the world to the other. And this unity is perfect, as is said by %0a%3c the prophet (Zachariah, 14:9): "And the Creator shall be one (for all), and His %0a%3c Name one"— all the senses will grasp the Creator's complete and perfect name, %0a%3c "the Infinitely good." %0a%3c %0a%3c Precisely because this most Supernal Degree is achieved as a result of %0a%3c bringing together all the suffering and punishments, it fills the entire universe %0a%3c with Light, including earth. However, it should be noted that the suffering of %0a%3c which The Zohar speaks is not the suffering of the body's lack of pleasure. It is %0a%3c the suffering caused by the absence of unity with the Creator! %0a%3c %0a%3c But if suffering is so useful, why is it written, "neither them nor the %0a%3c reward for them?" Suffering is necessary, for it is correction. However, the %0a%3c true suffering, for which man can receive the degree of the end of correction, %0a%3c is caused by temporary distancing from the Torah and Mitzvot as a result of %0a%3c feeling the pain of suffering, and this pains the Creator. Thus, the Shechina %0a%3c suffers, for when man suffers in his heart, he speaks ill of her, willingly or %0a%3c unwillingly. Although the Torah tells him to be patient, to endure and have %0a%3c faith above reason— selfless faith that all of this is the correction that he must %0a%3c undergo— he debases the Shechina by being unwilling to endure them and %0a%3c achieve the end of correction. %0a%3c %0a%3c Man's soul is also a Partzuf consisting of ten Sefirot. In its initial, spiritually %0a%3c undeveloped, unborn state, the soul is defined as a point, as a potential future %0a%3c spiritual body. If man works on himself, this point within him gradually acquires %0a%3c a screen, and he makes a Zivug on it. He repels all the pleasures for the sake of %0a%3c the Creator's desires, and receives Light in this point. Thus, he "amplifies" it to %0a%3c the size of a Partzuf and transforms it into a body, a newborn Partzuf. %0a%3c %0a%3c Afterwards he continues to cultivate his screen, gradually nurturing the %0a%3c small state into the big one, until he receives all of the Light destined for him %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Night of the Bride %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 305 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c by the Creator within his spiritual body. This state is called "the end of the %0a%3c personal correction." When all the personal corrections merge into one, the %0a%3c general correction of the entire world (of Malchut) will occur. Malchut is a Partzuf %0a%3c that consists of separate souls; each soul, the Partzuf of each soul, is part of %0a%3c Malchut, and Malchut is a collection, the sum of all the Partzufim that are to be %0a%3c made by all the people. To make a Partzuf is to acquire a screen and become %0a%3c filled with Light. %0a%3c %0a%3c THOSE THAT RESIDE ABOVE AND THOSE THAT RESIDE BELOW %0a%3c refers to the order of time in the spiritual, eternal world, which is different from %0a%3c ours. When the Creator wished to create the world, He immediately created %0a%3c everything: all the souls filled with Light in a state of absolute perfection, called %0a%3c "the end of correction," where all the creatures receive the infinite delight that %0a%3c He envisioned. %0a%3c %0a%3c This ultimate state was born with the Creator's first thought to create the %0a%3c world, and it exists in its final form from the very first moment, for the future, %0a%3c present, and past are merged in the Creator, and the factor of time does not %0a%3c exist in Him. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 1. Change of time: the stretching of time into infinity, i.e., when time %0a%3c stops and the present merges with the past and the future; when %0a%3c time reverses its course or disappears. Yet, time is the only thing that %0a%3c provides us with a perception of existence. By "switching off time, we %0a%3c stop perceiving that we exist! %0a%3c %0a%3c 2. Transformation of space: expanding and contracting of space into %0a%3c point; space taking other forms, other dimensions; infinity and tota %0a%3c absence of space altogether. %0a%3c %0a%3c I've already dealt with these issues in my book, Kabbalah, Science and the %0a%3c Meaning of Life, and I would prefer not to digress from the text of The Zohar. %0a%3c However, to understand our true state, and not the one we currently perceive, it %0a%3c is essential to remember that notions of time and space do not exist with regard to %0a%3c Creator. In reality, we are completely different and exist in a completely different %0a%3c form and state from what we presently perceive. We feel this way because our %0a%3c sensations are distorted by our egoism, which infuse our senses and possess our %0a%3c bodies, like a cloud. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, all that is described in the Torah refers strictly to the spiritual %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 306 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c and future, for time exists only with regard to those who are still confir %0a%3c their egoistic Kelim (desires). From this we can understand what is said %0a%3c Torah: "The Creator showed Adam each generation and its representatives, %0a%3c showed it to Moshe as well" (Talmud, Sanhedrin, 38:2). %0a%3c %0a%3c Yet, if the above described unfolded before the creation of these generations, %0a%3c how can the Creator show them to Adam and Moshe? It is possible because all %0a%3c the souls with all their destinies from the moment of their creation to the end of %0a%3c their correction emerged before the Creator in their completeness and reside in %0a%3c the Supernal Garden of Eden. From there they descend and enter the bodies %0a%3c our world, each at their own "time." And there, "Above," the Creator re %0a%3c them to Adam, Moshe, and all the others who were worthy of it. Howeve %0a%3c is a difficult notion, and not every mind is ready to grasp it. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, The Zohar says (Terumah, 163) that the way the six Sefirot of Zeir %0a%3c Anpin unite as ONE above Chazeh, de Zeir Anpin, where they are free from the %0a%3c Klipot, Malchut unites with Zeir Anpin below his Chazeh, so that unity exists %0a%3c below, as it does Above. For the Creator (Zeir Anpin) is One (male) Above. And %0a%3c Malchut becomes One (female), so that One (male) would be with One (female). %0a%3c This is the secret of unity expressed in the words: "He and His Name are one"; %0a%3c "He" (ZA) and "His Name" (Malchut) are within one another. %0a%3c %0a%3c The degree that is born at the end of correction, in the state of "He and %0a%3c His Name are one," already exists Above as the sum of all the 600,000 souls and %0a%3c deeds during the 6,000 degrees (called "years") in the world, which will emerge %0a%3c before the end of correction, but exist in their eternal form Above, where the %0a%3c future is as present. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, the pillar of Light that will shine upon the world from one end %0a%3c to the other at the end of correction already exists in the Supernal Garden %0a%3c of Eden, which illuminates it with the same brilliance that will be revealed to %0a%3c us in the future. This is because at the end of correction the two degrees will %0a%3c shine as one, and "He and His Name will be one." A pillar (line) of Light will %0a%3c appear, made of those that reside Above (the souls that reside in the Supernal %0a%3c Garden of Eden) and those that reside below (the souls clothed in the bodies %0a%3c of our world). And "One receives One"; these two degrees shine together, and %0a%3c reveal the Creator's unity thereby, as it is said that on that day "He and His %0a%3c Name will be one." %0a%3c %0a%3c From the aforesaid one can assume that the pillar of Light that shines in %0a%3c the Supernal Garden of Eden descends and shines in the Garden of Eden of %0a%3c our world. But this is not so. Rather, FROM THE FIRST-FIRMAMENTS %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Night of the Bride %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 307 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ARE MADE, for this degree exits onto a Zivug of Yesod of Zeir Anpin, called %0a%3c "firmament." Therefore, all the Zivugim that ascend above the firmament shine %0a%3c upon those that receive them from the firmament and below. The degree above %0a%3c the firmament is referred to as "Heaven," and the degree that receives from the %0a%3c firmament is called "earth." %0a%3c %0a%3c When the line (pillar) of Light unites the inhabitants of Above and those %0a%3c of below, the distinction between the Supernal Garden of Eden and the %0a%3c inhabitants of this world still remains. This is because the inhabitants of the %0a%3c Supernal Garden of Eden receive from a Zivug above the firmament, and what %0a%3c they receive is called "the new Heaven for the inhabitants of Above." And only %0a%3c a small luminescence, called "the new earth," descends below the firmament to %0a%3c the inhabitants of below. This is what The Zohar says: "From the first— firmaments %0a%3c are made, and from the second, from their return— earth." %0a%3c %0a%3c Although in this great Zivug, as in all Zivugim, all that is decided above the %0a%3c firmament, above the Zivug, spreads down to earth, below the line of the Zivug, %0a%3c one should not think that this Zivug (like all the previous ones) is merely a thin %0a%3c line of Light, called "one," a limited, inner place, as it is written at the beginning %0a%3c of creation: "Let the waters gather together unto one place," i.e., in the inner %0a%3c place of the worlds (and not the outer), a place of Israel. %0a%3c %0a%3c But the Light of this Zivug revolves around the world and fills it whole. This %0a%3c Light reaches even the outer parts of the worlds (the nations of the world), as %0a%3c the prophet writes: "The earth shall be filled with Knowledge of the Creator" %0a%3c (Yeshayahu, 11:9). %0a%3c %0a%3c 142. And since out of them Heavens were created, who resides there? He %0a%3c returned and said, "There is a shelter for the sun in them. This is the holy %0a%3c sun, called Zeir Anpin, and it dwells and resides there, and adorns itself %0a%3c with them." %0a%3c %0a%3c 143. Since Zeir Anpin resides in those firmaments and clothes in them, he %0a%3c emerges like a bridegroom out of his wedding canopy, and rejoices and races %0a%3c along these firmaments, and exits them and enters, and races toward a tower %0a%3c in a different place. He emerges from one end of Heaven, from the Upper %0a%3c World, from the Highest place, from Bina. And his season— where is it? It is %0a%3c the opposite place below, i.e., Malchut, which is the year's season that forms %0a%3c all the ends and binds everything— from Heaven to this firmament. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar speaks of the great secret of the sun coming out of its hiding. It is %0a%3c worth noting that Kabbalists often use the word "secret" only to explain and as %0a%3c if reveal the mystery in the passages that follow. The reader should nevertheless %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 308 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c i that there are no secrets in the world. Man attains everything frc %0a%3c in our world, in the process of his mental development, %0a%3c attains new notions on every new degree. And whatever he considered %0a%3c only yesterday now becomes clear and revealed before him. %0a%3c %0a%3c The same is true with regard to spiritual attainments. Kabbalah is called a %0a%3c secret wisdom, for it is concealed from ordinary people, it is a secret to them. But %0a%3c as soon as one acquires a screen and begins to perceive the spiritual world, he %0a%3c sees the secret becomes a reality. And this process continues until he completely %0a%3c attains the entire universe, all of the Creator's secrets ("Introduction to the %0a%3c Study of the Ten Sefirot," item 148). %0a%3c %0a%3c The sun emerges from its hiding (sheath— Nartik), from under the Huppah, %0a%3c and rushes to a tower at a different place— after the great Zivug under the Huppah. %0a%3c Zeir Anpin leaves his hiding and enters Malchut, called the tower of Oz (strength) %0a%3c of the Creator's Name, for Malchut then ascends and unites with ZA, and they %0a%3c become as one. %0a%3c %0a%3c The end of Malchut is called "the year's season." And until the end of %0a%3c correction, the impure forces, called "the end of days," attach themselves to %0a%3c it. Now, after the end of correction, it is still necessary to correct this part of %0a%3c Malchut, called "the end of days." To this end, the sun emerges from its hiding, %0a%3c LIKE THE BRIDEGROOM EMERGING FROM UNDER THE HUPPAH, %0a%3c and shines, and enters the tower of Oz (Malchut), races and shines on all the %0a%3c ends of Malchut to correct "the year's season" of the lower end of Heaven. %0a%3c %0a%3c For this last action corrects all the ends of Malchut and unites all from the %0a%3c Heavens to the firmament. In other words, Malchut receives the Light of THE %0a%3c END OF HEAVENS above the firmament (ZA). %0a%3c %0a%3c 144. There is nothing hidden on account of the year's season and the phase %0a%3c of the sun that revolves in all directions. And there is no concealment, i.e., %0a%3c not a single Supernal Degree is hidden from him, for all were bound together %0a%3c and everyone appeared before him, and none could be concealed from him. %0a%3c Thanks to him and thanks to them he returned to them, to the friends, in the %0a%3c phase of complete return and correction. All this year and all this time is for %0a%3c the Torah (to study it), as it is written: "The Creator's Torah is perfect." %0a%3c %0a%3c After the great Zivug, a restriction was imposed on all the Upper Light %0a%3c (item 94). Therefore, a new Zivug (TOWER) is necessary, which reveals anew %0a%3c all of the Upper Light that was concealed on account of the disappearance of %0a%3c the degree of BON, before it begins to ascend to SAG. Thus, NOTHING IS %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Night of the Bride %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 309 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c CONCEALED FROM THAT PHASE OF THE SUN THAT REVOLVES IN %0a%3c ALL DIRECTIONS. %0a%3c %0a%3c Indeed, a Zivug between the phase of the sun and the year's season corrects %0a%3c the ends of Malchut on all sides, until the correction is completed. Thus, BON %0a%3c ascends and becomes like SAG, which amounts to the complete correction %0a%3c of BON, whereupon THERE IS NO CONCEALMENT, NOT A SINGLE %0a%3c SUPERNAL DEGREE IS CONCEALED FROM HIM, for all the degrees and %0a%3c the Upper Light are once more revealed in their perfection. AND NOTHING %0a%3c CAN BE CONCEALED FROM Him, for all the degrees and Light gradually %0a%3c return to Him, until all become revealed. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is hence said that the revelation does not occur at once, for while in %0a%3c its phase, the sun travels and shines in sufficient measure for a COMPLETE %0a%3c RETURN, as it is written that He punishes the sinners and cures the righteous, %0a%3c whereupon they all merit the complete revelation of the Star. %0a%3c %0a%3c 145. The word HdVaYaH is written six times, and there are six verses from %0a%3c "the Heavens declare" and until "The Creator's Torah is perfect" (Tehilim, %0a%3c 19:2-8). And this is the secret of the word BERESHEET, which consists of %0a%3c six letters: THE CREATOR CREATED ET (THE) HEAVENS AND THE %0a%3c EARTH, six words in all. The other sources of the verse from "The Creator's %0a%3c Torah is perfect" and until "they are better than gold" (Tehilim, 19:2-8) %0a%3c correspond to the six utterances of the name HaVaYaH in them. The sources %0a%3c from "the Heavens declare" through "The Creator's Torah is perfect" are for %0a%3c the six letters in the word BERESHEET, whereas the six names are for the %0a%3c six words from "the Creator created" through "the Heavens and the earth." %0a%3c %0a%3c It is known that any degree born or revealed in the worlds is first revealed %0a%3c through its letters, which signifies the, as yet, unattainable. Afterwards, it %0a%3c appears in the combination of letters. This degree then becomes attainable, %0a%3c its contents become known, as previously described with the letters RYU = 216 %0a%3c andAB = 72 (item 116). %0a%3c %0a%3c The six letters in the word BERESHEET contain everything that exists in %0a%3c Heaven and on earth, but in an unattainable form, and are hence designated by %0a%3c these letters alone, without their combinations. Then there are the six words: %0a%3c Bara Elokim Et Ha-Shamayim Ve-Et Ha-Aretz (THE CREATOR CREATED THE %0a%3c HEAVENS AND THE EARTH), where everything that the word BERESHEET %0a%3c contains (Heaven, earth, and all their inhabitants) is already attained. %0a%3c %0a%3c The same principle allows us to understand what is included in the six %0a%3c verses from "the Heavens declare" to "The Creator's Torah is perfect." This is %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 310 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c just the beginning of the revelation of attaining the end of creation in the form %0a%3c of letters, as with the six letters in the word BERESHEET. %0a%3c %0a%3c And the complete revelation, the attainment of the end of creation begins %0a%3c with the verse "The Creator's Torah is perfect." This verse contains six names, %0a%3c each of which constitutes unique attainment, thus indicating that only after the %0a%3c completion of this degree do all the letter combinations become revealed and %0a%3c attained in the great Zivug at the end of correction, as it is said, NOTHING IS %0a%3c CONCEALED IN CONSEQUENCE OF HIM. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is why The Zohar says that THE WORD BERESHEET, WHICH %0a%3c CONSISTS OF six, IS WRITTEN (SPEAKS) ABOUT THIS SECRET. The %0a%3c word BERESHEET contains six letters, where Heaven and earth are concealed, %0a%3c before they become revealed in the six words, THE CREATOR CREATED %0a%3c THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH. %0a%3c %0a%3c The same applies to the six verses (Tehilim, 19:2-8): the great Zivug of the %0a%3c end of correction is not yet revealed from THE HEAVENS DECLARE to THE %0a%3c CREATOR'S TORAH IS PERFECT. Only after NOTHING IS CONCEALED %0a%3c IN CONSEQUENCE OF HIM are the six names revealed, which in turn reveal %0a%3c the end of correction in its full perfection. %0a%3c %0a%3c 146. As they were sitting and talking, Rabbi Elazar, the son of Rabbi Shimon, %0a%3c entered. He said to them: "Certainly, the face of the Shechina has come, hence %0a%3c I called you Pniel (Pnei-face + El-Creator = the Creator's face)" (item 119), %0a%3c for you have seen the Shechina face to face. And now that you have attained %0a%3c Benayahu Ben-Yehoyada, it certainly refers to Atik, the Sefira of Keter, just %0a%3c as everything else that occurred afterwards, as it is written in the Torah: "And %0a%3c he slew the Egyptian." And he who is concealed from all— is Atik. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is said in the continuation of "The Donkey Driver," who revealed the soul %0a%3c of Benayahu Ben-Yehoyada to Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Aba, as a result of which %0a%3c Rabbi Shimon called them Pniel. For the soul of Benayahu Ben-Yehoyada is a %0a%3c spiritual degree destined to be revealed in the future, at the end of correction. %0a%3c This is why they were in a state of concealment of the Upper Light (item 113), %0a%3c as was already mentioned with regard to the Zivug of the sun's phase and the %0a%3c year's season, until they have found Rabbi Shimon Ben Lakunya and others, %0a%3c thus meriting all the Light once again. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, Rabbi Shimon says to them, YOU HAVE ATTAINED, %0a%3c BENAYAHU BEN-YEHOYADA WAS REVEALED TO YOU. This means %0a%3c that they have already attained the six verses, the essence of THE HEAVENS %0a%3c DECLARE, and exist in the six names. When they have attained the soul of %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Night of the Bride %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 311 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Benayahu Ben-Yehoyada with the help of the donkey driver, their attainment %0a%3c had not yet been revealed to them, as they still existed in the six verses— the %0a%3c reason for their concealment. But now they have attained and revealed his soul, %0a%3c that it is the great Zivug of Atik, when everything is revealed to all. %0a%3c %0a%3c 147. The words, "He slew the Egyptian" are explained in another place, i.e., %0a%3c at a different degree, in a different way. He opened and said, "He slew the %0a%3c Egyptian, a man of good stature, five cubits high." All of this refers to the %0a%3c same secret. This Egyptian is the one who is well-known and is described as %0a%3c "very great in the land of Egypt in the eyes of the Jew," for he is great and %0a%3c honored, as that old man had already explained (item 99). %0a%3c %0a%3c The Torah describes the killing of the Egyptian in the book Shemot (2:12). %0a%3c As we have already learned from the article about Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba, it is %0a%3c expressed differently at a different degree (in a different language, the language %0a%3c of Divrey HaYamim). However, these two verses are the same secret, for it is %0a%3c written in the book Shmuel 1 (11:23): "And he slew the Egyptian, a prominent %0a%3c man," while in Divrey HaYamim it is written: "And he slew the Egyptian, a man %0a%3c of good stature, five cubits high." Both verses are the same secret, which The %0a%3c Zohar continues to clarify. %0a%3c %0a%3c 148. This case was examined at the Divine Assembly. "A prominent man" %0a%3c and "a man of good stature" are the same, as they constitute Shabbat and %0a%3c the bounds of Shabbat. As it is written: "You shall measure it from outside %0a%3c the city." It is also written, "You shall not impede limitations in measure." %0a%3c Hence, he was a man of good stature. Precisely such, from one end of the %0a%3c world to the other. Such is he, Adam, the first man. And should you disagree, %0a%3c referring to the written "five cubits," know that these five cubits extend from %0a%3c one end of the world to the other. %0a%3c %0a%3c The matter concerns the Divine Assembly, of which Rabbi Shimon said: "I %0a%3c saw those ascending, but how few they were" (Talmud, Sukkah, 45:2). There is a %0a%3c lower assembly of the angel Matat. However, the described above takes place in %0a%3c the Supernal Assembly, which will be clarified further. %0a%3c %0a%3c "A prominent man" is the degree of Moshe, of whom it is written in the %0a%3c Torah: "And there hath not since risen a prophet in Israel such as Moshe" %0a%3c (Devarim, 34: 10), of whom it is written "My servant Moshe is not so; he is trusted %0a%3c in all My house; with him do I speak mouth to mouth, clearly, and not with %0a%3c riddles" (Bamidbar, 12:7-8). %0a%3c %0a%3c "A prominent man" also constitutes a measure, which extends from one end %0a%3c of the world to the other. Moreover, its form and size correspond to Shabbat and %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 312 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c the bounds of Shabbat, where the bounds of Shabbat are the end of its measure. %0a%3c During the 6,000 years, the bounds of Shabbat are limited by only 2,000 Amah %0a%3c (cubits). However, after the end of correction, the bounds of Shabbat will extend %0a%3c from one end of the world to the other, as it is written: "And the Lord shall be %0a%3c King over all the earth" (Zachariah, 14:9). %0a%3c %0a%3c As we already know, the Light can descend and fill the Partzufim down to the %0a%3c level of Parsa of the world of Atzilut. Shabbat is a spiritual state when the worlds %0a%3c of BYA with all that inhabit them rise above the Parsa to the world of Atzilut. %0a%3c Above Parsa are only pure forces, corrected desires (Kelim). Hence, naturally %0a%3c there is no need to separate pure Kelim from impure ones and to correct them %0a%3c during Shabbat. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, the Light of Shabbat shines not only in the world of Atzilut, but %0a%3c beyond its bounds as well. It thus affects the sixteen Sefirot from Parsa down to %0a%3c Cha^eh of the world of Yetzira so the soul can be in the state of "Shabbat" with %0a%3c these desires, too. The language of our world describes this as the permission %0a%3c to transcend the bounds of the city of Atzilut (seventy Amah) by 2,000 Amah %0a%3c down to the Chazeh of the world of Beria, and then another 2,000 Amah from %0a%3c Chazeh of the world of Beria to Chazeh of the world of Yetzira. (Seventy Amah are %0a%3c regarded as being within the city limits.) %0a%3c %0a%3c However, after all the Kelim (desires) are corrected, there will be no %0a%3c restrictions; the world of Atzilut will extend down to our world, and only the %0a%3c state of Shabbat will prevail in the entire world— in all desires of all creatures. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is hence written: A PROMINENT MAN and A MAN OF GOOD %0a%3c STATURE are one and the same, for they constitute Shabbat and the bounds %0a%3c of Shabbat, as is said: AND YOU SHALL MEASURE FROM OUTSIDE THE %0a%3c CITY, and it is also written: YOU SHALL NOT IMPEDE JUDGMENT IN %0a%3c MEASURE. It follows that an object's measure represents its limit, just as %0a%3c the words A MAN OF GOOD STATURE alludes to the end, the bounds of %0a%3c Shabbat after the end of correction, which will extend from one end of the %0a%3c world to the other. %0a%3c %0a%3c AND HE SHALL BE PRECISELY MAN OF GOOD STATURE indicates %0a%3c that size does not rule over him; rather, he rules over size, and it is he who %0a%3c determines this size according to his own will. SUCH IS HE, ADAM, who, %0a%3c prior to his sin, extended and shone from one end of the world to the other %0a%3c (Talmud, Hagigah, 12:1), as the bounds of Shabbat after the end of correction. %0a%3c %0a%3c FIVE CUBITS FROM ONE END OF THE WORLD TO THE OTHER- %0a%3c because the five cubits are the five Sefirot: Keter, Hochma, Bina, ZA, and Malchut %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Night of the Bride %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 313 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c that expand and fill everything from one end of the world to the other after the %0a%3c end of correction. %0a%3c %0a%3c 149. It is, as is written, "like a weaver's beam" (Shmuel 1, 17: 7) "as the %0a%3c Divine staff" (Shemot, 4:20) that was in his hand, which reveals by the %0a%3c secret name (Light) confirmed in it by the Light of the letter combinations %0a%3c that Betzalel and his disciples engraved, called "weaving," as is written, %0a%3c "He filled them and others, and BOUND them." And that staff— within it %0a%3c shone a secret name, inscribed on all its sides by the Light of the sages, who %0a%3c confirmed the secret name in forty-two properties. And the rest of what %0a%3c is written from here onward is similar to what the old man had already %0a%3c explained. Happy is his lot! %0a%3c %0a%3c The secret of the letter combinations in sacred names is called "weaving," %0a%3c like a weaver joins his threads into a fabric, the letters join into combinations of %0a%3c sacred names, which designate man's spiritual level of their attainment. Hence, %0a%3c The Zohar says that the Creator's staff in Moshe's hand had engraved the letter %0a%3c combinations of the secret name, which Betzalel and his disciples engraved as %0a%3c they worked on the Tabernacle. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Creator's staff is therefore called a "weaver's beam." The Hebrew word %0a%3c for "beam" is MANOR (from OHR— Light). This refers to the Light of the letter %0a%3c combinations in the secret name, which Betzalel weaved and engraved, as it is %0a%3c said, "by the Light of the letter combinations that Betzalel engraved." %0a%3c %0a%3c However, the staff does not shine in all directions until the end of correction, %0a%3c for there is a distinction between the Creator's staff and that of Moshe. It is %0a%3c written of the staff of Moshe: "Put forth your hand and take it by the tail (of a %0a%3c snake), and it shall become a staff in your hand" (Shemot, 4:4). This means that %0a%3c it did not shine from all sides. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, after the end of correction, it will shine in all directions, as it is %0a%3c said: "And the secret name shone from within that staff in all directions by the %0a%3c Light of sages, who confirmed the secret name in forty-two properties." For the %0a%3c secret name that was engraved on the staff shone in all directions, i.e., in the %0a%3c property called "He will eradicate death forever" (Yeshayahu, 25:8). It will thus %0a%3c begin to shine evenly in all directions, whereas the Light of the name engraved %0a%3c on the staff is the Light of Hochma of the Name MB. %0a%3c %0a%3c 150. Be seated, dear friends. Be seated and let us renew the correction of the %0a%3c Bride on this night, for whomever joins her on this night shall be guarded %0a%3c Above and below in the coming year. And this year shall pass over him in %0a%3c peace. Such people are described in the verse: "The angel of the Lord stands %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 314 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c round those that fear Him, and delivers them. O taste and see that the Creator %0a%3c is good" (Tehilim, 34:8-9). %0a%3c %0a%3c As was already stated in item 125, there are two explanations of the aforesaid. %0a%3c The first is that since the day of the giving of the Torah is the Light of the end %0a%3c of correction that abolishes death forever and brings freedom from the angel of %0a%3c death, one should exert to receive this Light on the day of Shavuot (Pentecost), as %0a%3c Light is renewed on the holiday and brings deliverance from death. %0a%3c %0a%3c According to the second explanation, Malchut is called a "year," and the %0a%3c renewal of the Light by those who keep the Torah after the end of correction %0a%3c will also bring the complete and final correction of the year (Malchut). This is %0a%3c because the renewal of the Light by those who keep the Torah is referred to as %0a%3c the correction of the night of the bride, Malchut, called a "year." And this brings %0a%3c us to a corrected year. %0a\ No newline at end of file%0a
