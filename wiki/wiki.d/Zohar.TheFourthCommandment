text=The Fourth Commandment %0a%0a%0a%0a208. The fourth Mitzva is to know that HaVaYaH (the Creator) is Elokim %0a(Lord), as it is written; KNOW THIS DAY AND LAY IT IN YOUR HEART %0aTHAT HaVaYaH-CREATOR IS ELOKIM— LORD. That is, the name %0aElokim is included in the name of the HaVaYaH, and there is no distinction %0abetween them. %0a%0aHaVaYaH is ZA, and Elokim is Nukva de ZA. It is essential to unite ZA with %0aNukva by making their properties similar, so there is no distinction between %0athem. Thus, the name Elokim of Nukt/a will be included in the name HaVaYaH %0aof ZA, so that Nukva herself will become as HaVaYaH. %0a%0aThis union signifies the reception of Ohr Hochma (GAR) in ZON, for the %0aunion implied by the words HEAR, O ISRAEL is the reception of the Light of %0aVAK from AVI in ZON. The unity in question here is the reception from AVI in %0aZON of the Light of GAR (Hochma). One can never receive an entire degree in %0aone go: first VAK is received, and only then GAR. %0a%0a209. Hence, it is written, "Let the stars in Heaven shine upon the earth." %0aThis means that both names, HaVaYaH and ELOKIM, are as one. This way, %0aMalchut (Elokim) should merge with the name HaVaYaH (ZA). The black Light %0a(Malchut) with the white Light (ZA), as one, without distinction. The white %0acloud by day (ZA) with the pillar of fire by night (Malchut)', the property of day %0a(ZA) merged with the property of night (Malchut), so they shine as one star. %0a%0aNukva is called "a small star." Initially, there were two stars, ZA and Malchut, %0aand both were the same size. But the moon (Malchut) complained that two stars %0acannot use one crown (source of Light). The Creator reply to Malchut was, "Go %0aand diminish yourself (Talmud, Hulin, 60:2). %0a%0aAs a result, the nine lower Sefirot of Malchut descended below the Parsa to %0athe world of Beria, and only one Sefira, Keter de Malchut, remained in the world %0a%0a399 %0a%0a%0a%0a400 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aof Atzilut. The task of the righteous is to elevate the nine lower Sefirot of Malchut %0afrom the world of Beria to the level of ZA, to correct her distinction from ZA, %0ai.e., to grow and make her equal to ZA once more, so she will make a Zivug with %0aZA face to face. Thus, they shall correct the detachment of Malchut from ZA that %0awas born of the moon's complaint. %0a%0aThe moon complained because it was unable to receive the Light directly %0afrom Ima, but only via ZA. Hence, the Creator gave it His advice: diminish %0ayourself to a point (the Sefira Keter) and lower the nine Sefirot from Hochma to %0aMalchut below the Parsa. Then, through the unity of "Hear, O Israel," rebuild %0aMalchut in VAK, in the lower unity of "Blessed be His great name for ever and %0aever," for the power of judgment within it corrects the letter Dalet in the word %0aEchad, turning the DRY LAND into the fruit-yielding EARTH. %0a%0aTherefore, the now black point of Malchut that caused its fall became as %0aimportant as Light, for it is precisely the strictness of judgment that builds the %0aletter Dalet in the word Echad and makes it fruit-bearing. And if Malchut had not %0ahad this power of judgment, the letter Dalet in the word Echad (Tvuna) would %0ahave remained DRY LAND. Hence, when the Light spreads inside her, the %0apower of judgment and restriction becomes more important than Light itself, %0afor it becomes the cause, the source of the Light of VAK, Ohr Hassadim. %0a%0aThus, it is now possible to receive Ohr Hochma in VAK de Malchut, while %0aelevating ZON to AVI. For now, just like ZA, Nulcua can unite with AVI in her %0aproperties. This was the basis of her previous complaint, for the Light-restricting %0apower within her turned into the cause of the Light's diffusion. Hence, ZA and %0aMalchut are considered a single whole: each of them constitutes the source of %0aLight for the other, whereas previously, Malchut was completely dependent on %0aZA, and therefore felt humiliated. %0a%0aAs a result of the union between ZA and Nukva in AVI, ZA connects to Aba, %0aand Nukva to Ima. ZA turns into white clouds in the daylight and Nukva turns %0ainto a pillar of fire in the Light of night, i.e., the properties of day and night %0amerge into one property, as it is written: AND THERE WAS EVENING AND %0aTHERE WAS MORNING, ONE DAY. Together they illuminate the earth and %0athose who inhabit Nukva in the worlds of BYA. %0a%0a210. This is the sin of the primeval serpent that unites below but separates %0aAbove; hence, it caused what it caused to the world. What should be united %0aAbove, should be separated below. The black light, which is Malchut, %0ashould be united Above with ZA into a single whole and then separate it %0afrom the "evil side." %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Fourth Commandment %0a%0a%0a%0a401 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe union and fulfillment of ZON with Ohr Hochma occurs only when %0athey ascend to AVI, above Chazeh de AA, where ZA merges with Aba and Nukva %0amerges with Ima. As a result, they unite, and ZA passes Ohr Hochma to Malchut. %0aHowever, in the permanent place of ZON, below Chazeh de AA, they cannot %0aform a union and allow ~Nukva to receive Ohr Hochma. %0a%0aThis is exactly what provoked Adam's sin and allowed the Serpent to bring %0adeath into the world (cause the disappearance of Ohr Hochma from Malchut), by %0acompelling Adam and Chava (Eve) to make a Zivug (union) in the permanent %0aplace of ZON, below Chazeh de AA. As a result, the Upper Zivug stopped in AVI, %0aas ZA started passing Ohr Hochma from AVI down to Malchut. %0a%0aThus, all the parts (souls) of Malchut existing in the world stopped receiving %0aOhr Hochma from AVI. This is regarded as death, for as soon as the impure forces %0aapproach ZON to draw their Ohr Hochma, AVI immediately terminate their Zivug %0afor the sake of ZON, to prevent the impure force from clinging to ZON. And as %0asoon as Ohr Hochma departs from ZON, the impure force leaves them at once, %0afor it approaches ZON with the sole purpose of feeding on Ohr Hochma. %0a%0aHowever, after being in Ima and receiving Ohr Hochma, Malchut descends to %0aher permanent place and passes this Light to the souls of the righteous, called %0athe "inhabitants of Malchut." She unites with them via equivalence of their %0aproperties, for in the absence of unity with ZA below, Malchut draws far from %0athe evil side and the impure forces cannot receive from her. %0a%0a211. Nevertheless, one should know that Elokim and HaVaYaH are one, %0awithout distinction. HaVaYaH is Elokim. If man knows that all is one and %0adoes not cause any separation, then even the opposite, impure forces disappear %0afrom the world, instead of descending below. %0a%0aAlthough there is fear that a Zivug will occur in ZON in their place below, %0athis is no cause to stop aspiring for a Zivug Above, in AVI. Moreover, one must %0aattain that HaVaYaH is Elokim, which is achieved by uniting ZA with Nukva. %0aAnd if man raises his MAN, thereby causing ZON to ascend to AVI and unite %0athere, the impure forces are completely rejected by the Light, weaken and finally %0adisappear from the world. %0a%0a212. The secret behind the word h/le'orot, which consists of the words %0aMavet (death) and Ohr (Light), is that the impure forces follow knowledge, %0aunderstanding, and thought. And this is Light, which is the opposite from %0adeath— Mavet, for the Light (Ohr) is inside death— Mavet (spelled as Me'ot) in %0a%0a%0a%0a402 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0athe word ME'ohrOT. This alludes to the fact that Light separates death, but %0awhen Light disappears, the letters unite and form the word "death." %0a%0aThe impure forces follow reason (knowledge, understanding, and thought). %0aReason signifies "Light," and the impure force is "death," where Light connects %0athe letters, while death separates them. %0a%0aHere is the explanation of this: the power of restriction in Malchut is the %0asource of the emergence of the impure forces. Because ZON united with AVI %0aso as to receive the Light of VAK and GAR, the power of restriction in Malchut %0aturned into Light by receiving the Light of VAK in the union below. Then, it %0aascended to AVI once more, and Malchut merged with ZA at the degree of AVI. %0a%0aThis union Above is designated by the word Me'orot = Ohr + Mavet. As a %0aresult of the Light of VAK and GAR descending to Nukva in the union with ZA %0aat the level of AVI, the power of restriction in Malchut turns into Light, and all %0athe impure forces that were created by this restriction disappear, for their root %0aturns to Light. Consequently, the letters of the word Mavet of the impure forces %0adisappear, and the words Me'ohrot Ohr appear instead. %0a%0a213. Chava started with these letters, and brought evil into the world. As it %0ais written, the woman SAW that it was good to bring the letters of the word %0aMe'ohrot back. From there she took the letters Vav-Tav-Reish-Aleph, leaving %0aonly the letters Mem and Vav. And they took with them the letter Tav, thus %0aforming the word Mem- Vav- Tav (Mavet— death). And they brought death %0ainto the world. %0a%0aThanks to the unity of the letters in the word Me'ohrot, designating the %0areception of Ohr Hochma in ZON, in the unity of ZON Above, the received Light %0aseparates the letters of Mavet in AVI, for it shines within them and forms a new %0acombination of the letters Me'ohrot. And if ZON make a union below, at their %0apermanent place, the Light disappears from the combination of letters Me'ohrot, %0aand the word Mavet (death) remains. %0a%0aAND THE WOMAN SAW THAT THE TREE WAS GOOD (Beresheet, %0a3:6). The Hebrew equivalent for the words "and saw" is Vetir'e = Vav-Tav-Reish- %0aAleph. These are the letters that depart from the word Me'ohrot (stars), leaving %0aonly Mem- Vav. They attach the letter Tav (Nukva of the impure forces) and form %0athe word Mavet— the name for Klipot. %0a%0aChava drew these letters from the word Me'ohrot, meaning she followed the %0aserpent's advice to unite ZON at their place below. In doing so, she violated %0athe holy union of the letters in the word Me'ohrot, for the union of ZON below %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Fourth Commandment %0a%0a%0a%0a403 %0a%0a%0a%0aimmediately causes the separation of AVI and the word Me'ohrot into Ohr %0a(Light) and Mavet (death). %0a%0aThe impure forces, called "death," contain a male part, called "Sam," and a %0afemale part, called "Lilit." The letter Mem is the male part of the word MaveT, %0acalled "Sam," and the letter Tav is its female part, called "Lilit." Thus, there was %0aa Zivug between the male and female parts, the letters Mem, Tav and Yesod (Vav), %0aforming the word MaVeT, as the name of the impure force. %0a%0aThis signifies the appearance of the serpent before Chava, and the %0atransference of impurity from it to her. As she followed its advice, the letter Tav %0aentered her, splitting the word Ohr (Light) and combining the letters into the %0aword Vetir'e (AND SAW). Then, the male part of the impure force (Mem-Vat;) %0aappeared and made a Zivug with Tav, which was already present in Chava; thus, %0adeath (MaVeT) appeared in the world. %0a%0a214. And look: said Rabbi Elazar: "My father, I have learned that after Chava %0ahad removed the letters VeTiR'E from the word Me'ohrot, the letters Mem %0aand Vav did not remain. Only the letter Mem remained, for the letter Vav, %0awhich is the letter of life, turned into death. This occurred because it attached %0athe letter Tav to itself, thus forming the word MaVeT." He replied: "Blessed %0aare you, my son!" %0a%0aRabbi Elazar answered that the letter Mem remained alone, without the %0aletter Vav, for Vav designates Yesod, whereas Sam (the male part of the impure %0aforces) lacks Yesod; hence, it is written that it is unable to procreate offspring, %0aakin to a castrated man. The letter Vav designates Yesod, the place of a Zivug, the %0aunion of the male and female parts of ZON. The letter Vav always designates %0alife, Yesod of the pure forces, whose Zivug bears fruit, for it is made on the screen %0athat stands in Yesod. %0a%0aHere, the pure letter Vav became impure and turned into Yesod of the impure %0aforce, MaVeT. After Vav received from Yesod of the pure forces, it united in a %0aZivug with Tav, and the word MaVeT was formed. This was precisely the sin of %0aAdam, which defiled the pure Vav. %0a

The fourth Mitzva is to know that HaVaYaH (the Creator) is Elokim %0a%3c (Lord), as it is written; KNOW THIS DAY AND LAY IT IN YOUR HEART %0a%3c THAT HaVaYaH-CREATOR IS ELOKIM— LORD. That is, the name %0a%3c Elokim is included in the name of the HaVaYaH, and there is no distinction %0a%3c between them. %0a%3c %0a%3c HaVaYaH is ZA, and Elokim is Nukva de ZA.

The secret behind the word h/le'orot, which consists of the words %0a%3c Mavet (death) and Ohr (Light), is that the impure forces follow knowledge, %0a%3c understanding, and thought. And this is Light, which is the opposite from %0a%3c death— Mavet, for the Light (Ohr) is inside death— Mavet (spelled as Me'ot) in %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 402 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c the word ME'ohrOT. This alludes to the fact that Light separates death, but %0a%3c when Light disappears, the letters unite and form the word "death." %0a%3c %0a%3c The impure forces follow reason (knowledge, understanding, and thought). %0a%3c Reason signifies "Light," and the impure force is "death," where Light connects %0a%3c the letters, while death separates them. %0a%3c %0a%3c Here is the explanation of this: the power of restriction in Malchut is the %0a%3c source of the emergence of the impure forces. Because ZON united with AVI %0a%3c so as to receive the Light of VAK and GAR, the power of restriction in Malchut %0a%3c turned into Light by receiving the Light of VAK in the union below.

As a %0a%3c result of the Light of VAK and GAR descending to Nukva in the union with ZA %0a%3c at the level of AVI, the power of restriction in Malchut turns into Light, and all %0a%3c the impure forces that were created by this restriction disappear, for their root %0a%3c turns to Light. Consequently, the letters of the word Mavet of the impure forces %0a%3c disappear, and the words Me'ohrot Ohr appear instead. %0a%3c %0a%3c 213. Chava started with these letters, and brought evil into the world. As it %0a%3c is written, the woman SAW that it was good to bring the letters of the word %0a%3c Me'ohrot back. From there she took the letters Vav-Tav-Reish-Aleph, leaving %0a%3c only the letters Mem and Vav. And they took with them the letter Tav, thus %0a%3c forming the word Mem- Vav- Tav (Mavet— death). And they brought death %0a%3c into the world. %0a%3c %0a%3c Thanks to the unity of the letters in the word Me'ohrot, designating the %0a%3c reception of Ohr Hochma in ZON, in the unity of ZON Above, the received Light %0a%3c separates the letters of Mavet in AVI, for it shines within them and forms a new %0a%3c combination of the letters Me'ohrot. And if ZON make a union below, at their %0a%3c permanent place, the Light disappears from the combination of letters Me'ohrot, %0a%3c and the word Mavet (death) remains. %0a%3c %0a%3c AND THE WOMAN SAW THAT THE TREE WAS GOOD (Beresheet, %0a%3c 3:6). The Hebrew equivalent for the words "and saw" is Vetir'e = Vav-Tav-Reish- %0a%3c Aleph. These are the letters that depart from the word Me'ohrot (stars), leaving %0a%3c only Mem- Vav. They attach the letter Tav (Nukva of the impure forces) and form %0a%3c the word Mavet— the name for Klipot. %0a%3c %0a%3c Chava drew these letters from the word Me'ohrot, meaning she followed the %0a%3c serpent's advice to unite ZON at their place below. In doing so, she violated %0a%3c the holy union of the letters in the word Me'ohrot, for the union of ZON below %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Fourth Commandment %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 403 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c immediately causes the separation of AVI and the word Me'ohrot into Ohr %0a%3c (Light) and Mavet (death). %0a%3c %0a%3c The impure forces, called "death," contain a male part, called "Sam," and a %0a%3c female part, called "Lilit." The letter Mem is the male part of the word MaveT, %0a%3c called "Sam," and the letter Tav is its female part, called "Lilit." Thus, there was %0a%3c a Zivug between the male and female parts, the letters Mem, Tav and Yesod (Vav), %0a%3c forming the word MaVeT, as the name of the impure force. %0a%3c %0a%3c This signifies the appearance of the serpent before Chava, and the %0a%3c transference of impurity from it to her. As she followed its advice, the letter Tav %0a%3c entered her, splitting the word Ohr (Light) and combining the letters into the %0a%3c word Vetir'e (AND SAW). Then, the male part of the impure force (Mem-Vat;) %0a%3c appeared and made a Zivug with Tav, which was already present in Chava; thus, %0a%3c death (MaVeT) appeared in the world. %0a%3c %0a%3c 214. And look: said Rabbi Elazar: "My father, I have learned that after Chava %0a%3c had removed the letters VeTiR'E from the word Me'ohrot, the letters Mem %0a%3c and Vav did not remain. Only the letter Mem remained, for the letter Vav, %0a%3c which is the letter of life, turned into death.
