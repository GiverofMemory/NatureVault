Next the OH- is collapsed into oxygen, water, and releases electrons.  These electrons go through a circuit and they are deposited on the right side which uses up water and oxygen to create OH- using these electrons. Since it is using water up, water is sucked through the membrane from left to right.  This is how the water moves.%0a%0a!!!Catalysts[[#catalyst]]%0a%0aAs we can see in the above, producing H2 is a loss for our system and this is why Ammonium hydroxide (added to one or both sides) helps increase the pumping more.  Water is attracted to the right side to complete the creation of OH-.  Also oxygen outgassing is a loss as well.  So if there are a lot of bubbles forming, we probably won't get much water movement.  Adding oxygen to the mix (potentially as peroxide) might help as well, just like the hydroxide.  Ammonium hydroxide would likely be best so you have no permanent cations in the solution.  Of course preventing this from diffusing through the membrane will help, but making the membrane too restrictive to flow would obviously restrict flow.  A balance is needed.  Hydroxide looks like it will help mostly the left side of the reaction, in the left side it pushes the reaction to create the products, and on the right it pushes the balance back to the reactants which we don't want.  Also hydroxide will remove H+ from the left side of the system, improving efficiency.%0a%0aOxygen apparently will only help the right side, as on the left side it would push the reaction back to the reactants, but on the right side it pushes the reaction to the products.  Removing oxygen from the left, perhaps with degassing, and pumping it to the right via an external mechanism, would probably be best.  %0a%0aOf course returning the hydroxide formed on the right, back to the left would also be ideal, but that would be difficult to do.  Of course we could acidify the right which would pull the reaction forward, however electrons would be wasted converting these H+ into H2 gas.  So if we did acidify it, we would also need to add H2 to push that hydrogen reaction backwards.  Any other cation that can remove OH- from the system, while not bieng easily reduced by the electrons, can improve efficiency if added to the right side.  In practice these cations might be insoluble so they can't be reduced by the electrons. '''For example filling the right side with crushed shells (calcium carbonate)''' might be a great way to remove ''some'' OH from solution, producing CO2 and calcium hydroxide. Along that same vein, '''packing the left side with sand''' would also be good to help remove H+, since it has a negative charge. %0a%0aOf course removing water from the right side will also help pull the reaction forward, improving efficiency.  This includes using an absorbant or adsorbant of the water of some sort, which can be chemical, physical, electrical, or anything else.  Heat might also be used.%0a%0aCalcium Chloride [[https://chemiday.com/en/reaction/3-1-0-3842|#]] might be a "best of both worlds" additive to the right side.  It is hydroscopic which would mean it would reduce free water on the right side which we want causing more water to be pulled from the left causing movement.  But also it would neutralize the OH- produced on the right side creating insoluble CaOH which can be removed (settled out) as it builds up since it would suck up oxygen gas from the H2O2 added instead of it bieng used in the reaction.%0a%0aFor practicality an easy way to improve efficiency would to be to add something like ammonium hydroxide, or '''ammonium silicate''', or a combo of ammonium hydroxide and a silica source, to the left side of the cell (and prevent it from moving across the dielectric if possible) and '''degass''' the oxygen from the solution.  Adding water to this side ('''condense''') helps.%0a%0aOn the right side best to add hydrogen peroxide or '''sparge''' air or oxygen into the along with adding '''calcium chloride''' which removes OH- and absorbs water. Heat can also be added to the right side to improve efficiency by removing water ('''evaporate''') or any other method to remove water.%0a%0a!!!Membrane%0aA packed bed of dielectric, perhaps barium titanate crystals or another super dielectric, would likely be best. It doesn't have to be sintered, but can be.  %0a%0aSand would also be an easy dielectric membrane.  Chemically modifying the sand or adding other ingredients can also be done, to make it more polarizable (increasing [[dielectric]] constant) or any other purpose.%0a%0a!!Comparison with electrolysis%0aThis is very similar to how electrolysis works [[https://www.energy.gov/eere/fuelcells/hydrogen-production-electrolysis|#]] but in that case there are too many solutes and the water is destroyed rather than moving.%0a%0a!!Electrical considerations%0aThere is no net gain of electricity, all the power goes into movement.  You liberate 4e- on the positive side, and the 4e- gets used up on the negative side, in an ideal system.  Any O2 or H2 being produced (more specifically;leaving the system) means some of the energy is not going into movement.%0a%0a!!!Use as a generator%0aThis process also has some potential as a generator.  But simply pushing water and expecting to gain electricity is far fetched since only one part of the reactions, H2O, is moving.  However pressure effects can create favoring of OH- since it is closer packed, which can push H+ to the other side [[https://zenodo.org/record/4320128#.X9ej_-2IYuU|#]].  Combined with a "wire" connecting the two sides, electrons can flow from left to right (creating electricity) and produce H2 gas on the right.%0a%0aBut to generate usable power you will likely want the extra catalysts from the [[#catalyst|catalyst section]] which basically might create a [[triboelectricity|tribocharging]] effect of each electrode, for example the crushed shells on one side and sand on the other.

Ammonium hydroxide-peroxide would likely be best so you have no permanent cations in the solution.  Of course preventing this from diffusing to the left through the membrane will help, but making the membrane too restrictive to flow would obviously restrict flow.  A balance is needed.  Actually hydroxide looks like it will help both sides of the reaction, in the left side it pushes the reaction to create the products, and on the right it contributes to the structured water, OH-.  Also hydroxide will remove H+ from both sides of the system improving efficiency. However oxygen apparently will only help the right side, as on the left side it would push the reaction back to the reactants, but on the right side it pushes the reaction to the products.%0a
