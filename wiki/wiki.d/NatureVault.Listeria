Mononucleosis also was named for mononuclear leucocytosis [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_mononucleosis |#]].  Listeria also causes squelae including convulsions.  Another squelae can be retardation [[https://ageconsearch.umn.edu/record/234540/files/FRV24I2f.pdf|#]]. Escapes t cells and uses listeriolysins and phozpholipases inside cells.

Fortunatly ellagic acid also helps get iron under control as well as blood sugar (possibly because it neutralizes the bacteria) helping not only to directly neutralize the bacteria, but also to reduce some root causes of chronic infection.  Some essential oils that are effective against it are oregano and thyme.%0a%0aListeria cauuses what I will term as "type zero" [[diabetes]].

It is also amplified in [[Iron Overload]] and [[hemochromatosis]].%0a%3c %0a%3c Listeria causes [[cancer]] and is almost always a part of the microbial cause of cancer. Other bacteria can be part of the cancer cause as well including h pylori and others.%0a%3c %0a%3c Listeria is also amplified by [[sugar]] and is one of the main reasons why going on a sugar free diet and getting [[blood sugar]] under control is such an important thing to help reverse cancer.%0a%3c %0a%3c One of the most effective things against listeria is [[Ellagic acid]].  Fortunatly ellagic acid also helps get iron under control as well as blood sugar (possibly because it neutralizes the bacteria) helping not only to directly neutralize the bacteria, but also to reduce some root causes of chronic infection.  Some essential oils that are effective against it are oregano and thyme.%0a%3c %0a%3c Listeria cauuses what I will term as "type zero" [[diabetes]]. This form of diabetes usually stays in the pre-diabetes stage but drains peoples energy especially after they eat.  It also is likely correlated to insomnia.%0a%3c %0a
