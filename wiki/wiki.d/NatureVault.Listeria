Fortunatly ellagic acid also helps get iron under control as well as blood sugar (possibly because it neutralizes the bacteria) helping not only to directly neutralize the bacteria, but also to reduce some root causes of chronic infection.  Some essential oils that are effective against it are oregano and thyme.%0a%0aListeria causes what I will term as "type zero" [[diabetes]]. This form of diabetes usually stays in the pre-diabetes stage but drains peoples energy especially after they eat.  It also is likely correlated to insomnia.%0a%0a%0aAssociated with soft cheese esp unpasteurized, Deli meat, hot dog, leukemia, liver cancer, myeloma, giant cell arteritis,%0aStiff neck, meningitis, mammary gland infection.
