csum=Winter squash is an excellent [[survival food]] and ranks #6 on my list.  While not as much of a cultural staple as [[corn]], [[potato]]es, or [[cabbage]]; winter squash is a pretty nice way to survive.  With lots of sugar and starches in an extremely storable and stackable format, what is not to love?  Also these tend to have edible and healthy seeds as a protein source, which switches things up which keeps morale up.  The seeds are also easy to collect and store which makes planting probably the easiest of any food we have ranked.  !![[Iroquois]]  Crooknecks and bush-scallops grew in the Northeast, cushaws and sweet potato squashes in the South, the Boston marrow and autumn turban in New England.
