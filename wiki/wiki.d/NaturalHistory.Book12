THE HONOITEABLE PLACE OCCTIPIED BY TREES m %0a%0aTHE SYSTEM OF NATTJEE. %0a%0aSuch, then, is the history, according to their various species %0aand their peculiar conformations, of all the animals within the %0acompass of our knowledge. It now remains for us to speak of %0athe vegetable productions of the earth, which are equally far %0afrom being destitute of a vital spirit,' (for, indeed, nothing can %0alive without it), that we may then proceed to describe the mine- %0arals extracted from it, and so none of the works of Nature may %0abe passed by in silence. Long, indeed, were these last boun- %0aties of hers concealed beneath the ground, the trees and forests %0abeing regarded as the most valuable benefits conferred by Na- %0ature upon mankind. It was from the forest that man drew %0ahis first aliment, by the leaves of the trees was his cave ren- %0adered more habitable, and by their bark was his clothing sup- %0aplied ; even at this very day," there are nations that live %0aunder similar circumstances to these. Still more and more, %0athen, must we be struck with wonder and admiration, that %0afrom a primaival state such as this, we should now be cleaving %0athe mountains for their marbles, visiting the Seres ^ to obtain %0aour clothing, seeking the pearl in the depths of the Eed Sea, %0aand the emerald in the very bowels of the earth. For our %0aadornment with those precious stones it is that we have devised %0athose wounds which we make in our ears ; because, forsooth, %0ait was deemed not enough to carry them on our hands, our %0anecks, and our hair, if we did not insert them in our very flesh %0aas well. It will be only proper, then, to follow the order of %0ahuman inventions, and to speak of the trees before treating of %0a%0a1 " Aniraa." The notion that plants are possessed of a soul or spirit, is %0aderived from the Greek philosophers, who attributed to them intellect also, %0aand sense. %0a%0a- Vitruvius mentions the people of Gaul, Hispania, Lusitania, and %0aAquitania, as living in his day iu dwellings covered with oak shingles, or %0awith straw. %0a%0a» See B. vi. c. 20, and B. xi. c. 26. %0a%0a%0a%0a102 %0a%0a%0a%0aflint's natural histobt. %0a%0a%0a%0a[Book XII. %0a%0a%0a%0aother subjects ; thus may we trace up to their very origin the %0amanners and usages of the present day. %0a%0aCHAP. 2. (1.) THE EARLY HISTORY OF TREES. %0a%0aThe trees formed the first temples of the gods, and even at %0athe present day, the country people, preserving in all their %0asimplicity their ancient rites, consecrate the finest among their %0atrees to some divinity indeed, we feel ourselves inspired to %0aadoration, not less by the sacred groves and their very stiUness, %0athan by the statues of the gods, resplendent as they are with %0agold and ivory. Each kind of tree remains immutably conse- %0acrated to its own peculiar divinity, the beech* to Jupiter,* the %0alaurel to Apollo, the olive to Minerva, the myrtle to Venus, %0aand the poplar to Hercules : besides which, it is our behef %0athat the Sylvans, the Fauns, and various kinds of goddess %0aNymphs, have the tutelage of the woods, and we look upon %0athose deities as especially appointed to preside over them by %0athe will of heaven. In more recent times, it was the trees %0athat by their juices, more soothing even than corn, first molli- %0afied the natural asperity of man ; and it is from these that we %0anow derive the oil of the olive that renders the limbs so supple, %0athe draught of wine that so efficiently recruits the strength, %0aand the numerous delicacies which spring up spontaneously at %0athe various seasons of the year, and load our tables with their %0a\'iands — tables to replenish which, we engage in combat with %0awild beasts, and seek for the fishes which have fattened upon %0athe dead corpse of the shipwrecked mariner — indeed, it is only %0aat the second ' coxirse, after aU, that the produce of the trees %0aappears. %0a%0aBut, in addition to this, the trees have a thousand other %0auses, all of which are indispensable to the full enjoyment of %0a%0a* Desfontaines remarks, that we may still trace vestiges of this custom %0ain the fine trees that grow near church porches, and in church-yards. %0aOf course, his remark will apply to France more particularly. %0a%0a5 It is doubtful whether the aesculus of the Romans was the same as the %0abay-oak, the holm-oak, or the beech. See B. xvi. c. 4. %0a%0a« See further on this subject in Phaedrus's Fables, B. iii, f. 17. %0a%0a' Reckoning the promulsis, antecsena, or gustatio, not as a course, but %0aonly a prelude, the bellaria, or dessert, at the Roman banquets, formed the %0asecond course, or mensa. It consisted of fruits uncooked, sweetmeflts, and %0apastry. * %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 3.] %0a%0a%0a%0aEXOTIC TEEE8. %0a%0a%0a%0a103 %0a%0a%0a%0alife. It is by the aid of the tree that we plough the deep, and %0abring near to us far distant lands ; it is by the aid of the tree, %0atoo, that we construct our edifices. The statues, even, of the %0adeities were formed of the wood of trees, in the days when no %0aTalue had been set as yet on the dead carcase^ of a wild beast, %0aand when, luxury not yet deriving its sanction from the %0agods themselves, we had not to behold, resplendent with the %0asame ivory, the heads of the divinities* and the feet of our %0atables. It is related that the Gauls, separated from us as they %0awere by the Alps, which then formed an almost insurmountable %0abulwark, had, as their chief motive for invading Italy, its %0adried figs, its grapes, its oil, and its wine, samples^** of which %0ahad been brought back to them by Helico, a citizen of the %0aHelvetii, who had been staying at Rome, to practise there as %0aan artizan. We may offer some excuse, then, for them, when %0awe know that they came in quest of these various productions, %0athough at the price even of war. %0a%0aCHAP. 3. — EXOTIC TREES. WHEN THE PLANE-TREE FIRST %0aAPPEARED IN ITALY, AND W^HENCE IT CAME. %0a%0aBut who is there that will not, with good reason, be sur- %0aprised to learn that a tree has been introduced among us from %0aa foreign clime for nothing but its shade ? I mean the plane,^^ %0awhich was first brought across the Ionian Sea to the Isle'^ of %0aDiomcdes, there to be planted at his tomb, and was afterwards %0aimported thence into Sicily, being one of the very first exotic %0atrees that were introduced into Italy. At the present day, %0ahowever, it has penetrated as far as the country of the %0aMorini, and occupies even a tributary^^ soil ; in return for which %0a%0as He alludes to the pursuit of the elephant, for the purpose of obtaining %0aivory, which was extensively used in his day, in making the statues of the %0adivinities. %0a%0a9 A sarcastic antithesis. And yet Dalechamps would read "hominum" %0ainstead of " numinum" ! %0a%0a10 Praemissa. The exact meaning of this word does not appear. Though %0aall the M8S. agree in it, it is probably a corrupt reading. Plutarch, in %0ahis Life of Camillus, says that the wine of Italy was first introduced in %0aUaul by Aruns, the Etruscan. %0a%0a" The Platanus orientalis of Linnaeus. It received its name from the %0aGreek irKdrog, " breadth," by reason of its wide-spreading branches. %0aFor further mention of this island, now Tremiti, see B. iii. c. 30. %0a" He alludes, probably, to the "vectigal solarium," a sort of ground- %0a%0a%0a%0a104 %0a%0a%0a%0aPLI2^Y'S natuual histokt. %0a%0a%0a%0a[Book XIL %0a%0a%0a%0athose nations have to pay a tax for the enjoyment of its shade. %0aDionysius the Elder, one of the tyrants of Sicily, had plane- %0atrees conveyed to the city of Rhegium, where they were looked %0aupon as the great marvel of his palace, which was afterwards %0aconverted into a gymnasium. These trees did not, however, %0ain that locality, attain any very great height. I find it also %0astated by some authors, that there were some other instances, %0ain those days even, of plane-trees being found in Italy, and I %0afind some mentioned by name as existing in Spain. ^* %0a%0aCHAP. 4. THE NATUEE OF THE PLANE-TKEE. %0a%0aThis circumstance took place about the time of the capture %0aof the City of Eome ; and to such high honour, in the course %0aof time, did the plane-tree attain, that it was nurtured by %0apouring wine upon it, it being found that the roots were greatly %0astrengthened by doing so. Thus have we taught the very %0atrees, even, to be wine-bibbers ! %0a%0aCHAP. 5. — REMARKABLE FACTS CONNECTED WITH THE %0aPLANE-TREE, %0a%0aThe first plane-trees that were spoken of in terms of high %0aadmiration were those which adorned the walks of the Aca- %0ademy'^ at Athens — [in one of which], the roots extended a dis- %0atance of thirty-three cubits, and spread far beyond its branches. %0aAt the present day, there is a very famous plane in Lycia, %0asituate in close proximity to a fountain of the most refresh- %0aing coolness ; standing near the road, with the cavity in its %0a%0arent which the tributary nations paid to the Roman treasury. Virgil and %0aHomer speak of the shade of the plane-tree, as a pleasant resort for festive %0aparties. %0a%0aIt is not improbable that Pliny, in copying from Theophrastus, has %0ahere committed an error. That author, B. ix. c. 7, says : iv fiiv ydp Tf %0a'ASpia rrXdravov ov ^aaiv slvat, ttXtiv ntpl to AiofirjSovQ Upov %3cnraviav %0aSk Kai iv 'IrnXlg, Trdo-y. " They say that in Adria there are no plane- %0atrees, except about the temple of Diomedes : and that they are extremely %0arare in Italy." Pliny, probably, when his secretary was reading to him, %0amistook the word airaviav, "rare," for 'lo-Trart^, "in Spain." %0a%0a'5 It has been remarked that, in reality, this process would only tend %0ato impede its growth. Macrobius tells us, that Hortensius was guilty of %0athis singular folly. %0a%0ai« Situate near the sea-shore. It was here that Plato taught. See B. %0axxxi. c. 3. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. .3 .] %0a%0a%0a%0aTUJi PLANE-IEEE. %0a%0a%0a%0a105 %0a%0a%0a%0ainterior, it forms a species of house eighty-one feet in width. %0aIts summit, too, presents the foliage of a grove, while it shields %0aitself with huge branches, each of which would equal an ordi- %0anary tree in size, as it throws its lengthened shade across the %0afields. In addition to this, that nothing may be wanting to %0aits exact resemblance to a grotto, there is a circle of seats %0awithin, formed of stone, intermingled with pumice overgrown %0awith moss. This tree was looked upon as so worthy of remark, %0athat Licinius Mucianus, who was three times consul, and re- %0acently the legatus of that province, thought it a circumstance %0adeservicg of transmission even to posterity, that he, together %0awith eighteen persons of his retinue, had sat down to a banquet %0ain the interior of it. Its leaves afforded material for their %0acouches in the greatest abundance, while he himself, sheltered %0afrom every gust of wind, and trying in vain to hear the pat- %0atering of the rain on the leaves, took his meal there, and en- %0ajoyed himself more than he woidd have done amid the resplen- %0adence of marble, a multiplicity of paintings, and beneath a %0acieling refulgent with gold. %0a%0aAnother curious instance, again, was that afforded in the %0areign of the Emperor Caius.''' That prince was so struck with %0aadmiration on seeing a plane in the territory of Veliternum, %0awhich presented floor after floor, like those of the several stories %0aof a house, by means of broad benches loosely laid from branch %0ato branch, that he held a banquet in it — himself adding^^ very %0amaterially to the shade it threw — the triclinium being formed %0afor the reception of fifteen guests and the necessary attendants : %0ato this singular dining-room he gave the name of his "nest." %0a%0aAt Gortyna, in the Isle of Crete, there is, in the vicinity of %0aa fountain there, a single plane-tree, which has been long cele- %0abrated in the records of both the Greek and the Latin language : %0ait never loses its leaves, and from an early period one of the %0afabulous legends of Greece has been attached to it, to the effect %0athat it was beneath this tree that Jupiter lay with Europa ; %0ajust as if there had not been another tree of a similar nature %0a%0a" Caligula. %0a%0aIt is supposed that he here alludes sarcastically to the extreme cor- %0apulence of Caligula. %0a%0aM. Fee, the learned editor of the botanical books in Ajasson's trans- %0alation, remarks, that this cannot have been the Platanus of the botanists, %0aand that there is no tree of Europe, which does not lose its leaves, that at %0aall resembles it. %0a%0a%0a%0a106 %0a%0a%0a%0aPLimr's NATIJBAL HISTOET. %0a%0a%0a%0a[Book XII. %0a%0a%0a%0ain the island of Cyprus. Slips of the tree at Gortyna— so %0afond is man by nature of novelty — were at an early period %0aplanted at different places in Crete, and reproduced the natural %0aimperfections of the tree f° though, indeed, there is no higher %0arecommendation in the plane than the fact that in summer it %0aprotects us from the rays of the sun, while in winter it admits %0athem. In later times, during the reign of the Emperor %0aClaudius, a Thessalian eunuch, the freedman of MarcelluB %0a^serninus,^' who, however, from motives of ambition had en- %0arolled himself in the number of the freedmen of the emperor, %0aand had acquired very considerable wealth, introduced this %0aplane into Italy, in order to beautify his country-seat : so that %0ahe may not inappropriately be styled a second Dionysius. %0aThese monstrosities of other lands are still to be seen in Italy, %0aindependently of those which that country has herself devised. %0a%0aCHAP. 6. (2.) — THE CHAir^PLATANTTS. WHO WAS THE FIBST %0aTO CLIP GREEN SHEUB8. %0a%0aFor we find in Italy some plane-trees, which are kno-wn as %0achamseplatani,^^ in consequence of their stunted growth ; for %0awe have discovered the art of causing abortion in trees even, %0aand hence, even in the vegetable world we shall have occasion %0ato make mention of dwarfs, an unprepossessing subject in every %0acase. This result is obtained in trees, by a peculiar method %0aadopted in planting and lopping them. C. Matius,'" a member %0aof the Equestrian order, and a friend of the late Emperor %0aAugustus, invented the art of clipping arbours, within the last %0aeighty years. %0a%0aCHAP. 7. (3.) HOW THE CITEON IS PLANTED. %0a%0aThe cherry and the peach, and all those trees which have %0aeither Greek or foreign names, are exotics : those, however, of %0a%0a20 The tendency, namely, to lose their leaves. %0a%0a21 Grandson of Asinius Pollio. Tacitus tells us, that he was one of %0athose whom Piso requested to undertake his defence, when charged with %0ahaving poisoned Germanicus ; but he declined the oflSce. %0a%0a22 Or " ground plane-trees." It is by no means uncommon to see dwarf %0avarieties of the larger trees, which are thus reduced to the dimensions of %0amere shrubs. %0a%0aC. Matius Calvena, the friend of Julius and Augustus Caesar, as also %0aof Cicero. He is supposed to have translated the Iliad into Latin verse, %0aand to have written a work on cookery. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 8.] %0a%0a%0a%0aTHE TEEEg OF IITDIA. %0a%0a%0a%0a107 %0a%0a%0a%0athis number, which have begun to be naturalized among us, %0awill be treated of when I come to speak of the fruit-trees in %0ageneral. For the present, I shall only make mention of the %0areally exotic trees, beginning with the one that is applied to %0athe most salutary uses. The citron tree, called the Assyrian, %0aand by some the Median apple, is an antidote against poisons.*^ %0aThe leaf is similar to that of the arbute, except that it has %0asmall prickles-^ running across it. As to the fruit, it is never %0aeaten,''* but it is remarkable for its extremely powerful smell, %0aAvhich is the case, also, with the leaves ; indeed, the odour is %0aso strong, that it will penetrate clothes, when they are once %0aimpregnated with it, and hence it is very useful in repelling %0athe attacks of noxious insects. The tree bears fruit at all %0aseasons of the year ; while some is falling off, other fruit is %0aripening, and other, again, just bursting into birth. Various %0anations have attempted to naturalize this tree among them, for %0athe sake of its medical properties, by planting it in pots of %0aclay, with holes drilled in them, for the purpose of introducing %0a.the air to the roots; and I would here remark, once for all, %0athat it is as well to remember that the best plan is to pack all %0aslips of trees that have to be carried to any distance, as close %0atogether as they can possibly be placed. It has been found, %0ahowever, that this tree will grow nowhere*'' except in %0aMedia or Persia, It is this fruit, the pips of which, as we %0atave already mentioned,-^ the Parthian grandees employ in %0a■seasoning their ragouts, as being peculiarly conducive to the %0a'sweetening of the breath. We find no other tree very highly %0acommended that is produced in Media. %0a%0aCHAP. 8. (4.) — THE TREES OF INDIA. %0a%0aIn describing the country of the Seres, we have already %0a%0a2* See B. xxiii. c. 55. Fee remarks, that the ancients confounded the %0acitron with the orange-tree. %0a%0a'■'5 Fee remarks, that this is not the case. The arbute is described %0ain B. XV. c. 28. %0a%0a2« In the time of Plutarch, it had begun to be somewhat more used. It %0amakes one of the very finest preserves. %0a%0a2' At the present day, it is cultivated all over India, in China, South %0aAmerica, and the southern parts of Europe. Fee says, that they grow %0aeven fti the open air in the gardens of Malmaison. %0a%0a• ^ B. xi. c. 115. Virgil says the same, Georg. B. ii. 11. 134, 135. %0aTheophrastus seems to say, that it was the outer rind that was so used. %0a%0a%0a%0a108 %0a%0a%0a%0aflint's KATURAL niSTOltT. %0a%0a%0a%0a[Book XII. %0a%0a%0a%0amade mention of the wool-bearing; trees which it prorlu. %0aand we have, likewise, touched^" upon the extraordn %0amagnitude of the trees of India. Yirgil has spokcu m %0aglowing terms of the ebony-tree, one of those which are pecu- %0aliar to India, and he further informs us, that it will grow in %0ano other country. Herodotus, however, has preferred to %0aascribe ^- it to ^Ethiopia ; and states that the people of that %0acountry were in the habit of paying to the kings of Persia, %0aevery third year, by way of tribute,^-' one hundred billets of %0aebony-wood, together with a certain quantity of gold and %0aivory. Nor ought we here to omit the fact, inasmuch as the %0asame author has stated to that effect, that the iEthiopianj %0awere also in the habit of paying, by way of tribute, twenty %0alarge elephants' teeth. So high was tlae esteem in which %0aivory was held in the year from the building of our city, %0a310: for it was at that period that this author was com- %0apiling his History at Thurii, in Italy ; which is all the more %0aremarkable, from the implicit confidence we place in him, %0awhen he says^* that up to that time, no native of Asia or %0aGreece, to his knowledge at least, had ever beheld the river %0aPadus. The plan of ^Ethiopia, which, as we have already %0amentioned,^" was recently laid before the Emperor Nero, in- %0aforms us, that this tree is very uncommon in the country that %0alies between Syene, the extreme boundary of the empu-e, and %0aMeroe, a distance of eight hundred and ninetj^-six miles ; and %0athat, in fact, the only kind of tree that is to be found there, is %0athe palm. It was, probably, for this reason, that ebony held %0athe third place in the tribute that was thus imposed. %0a%0a29 See B. vi. c. 20. %0a%0a30 See B. vii. c. 2. The tree to which he alludes is unknown. %0a%0a31 Georg. B. ii. 11. 116, 117. %0a%0a33 B. iii. c. 97. There is little doubt that, under the general name of %0a" ebony," the wood of many kinds of trees was, and is still, imported into %0athe western world, so that both Herodotus and Virgil may have been cor- %0arect in representing ebony as the product of both India and Ethiopia. %0a%0a33* Herodotus says ttix> hundred. %0a%0a33 In Italy, whither he had retired from the hostile attacks of his fellow- %0acitizens. It is supposed by Le Vayer and others, that Pliny is wrong in %0ahis assertion, that Herodotus wrote to this effect while at Thurii ; though %0aDr. Schmitz is inclined to be of opinion that he is ri%3c!;ht in his statement. %0a%0a3i B. iii. c. 115. %0a%0a35 B. vi. c. 35. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. II.] %0a%0a%0a%0aTHE INDIAN FIG. %0a%0a%0a%0a109 %0a%0a%0a%0aCHAP. 9. — wnEir ebony was first seen at eome. the various %0a%0aKINDS OF EBONT. %0a%0aPompeius Magnus displayed ebony on the occasion of his %0atriumph over Mithridates. Fabianus declares, that this wood %0awill give out no flame ; it burns, however, with a very agree- %0aable smeU. There are two kinds of ebony ; the rarest kind %0ais the best, and is produced from a tree that is singularly free %0afrom knots. The wood is black and shining, and pleasing to %0athe eye, without any adventitious aid from art. The other %0akind of ebony is the produce of a shrub which resembles the %0acytisus, and is to be found scattered over the whole of India. %0a%0aCHAP. 10. (5.) THE INDIAN THORN. %0a%0aThere is in India, also, a kind of thorn" very similar to %0aebony, though it may be distinguished from it, by the aid of %0aa lantern even ; for, on the application of flame, it will in- %0astantly run across the tree. We will now proceed to describe %0athose trees which were the admiration of Alexander the Great %0ain his victorious career, when that part of the world was first %0arevealed by his arms. %0a%0aCHAP. 1 1 . THE INDIAN FIG. %0a%0aThe Indian fig bears but a small fruit. Always growing %0aspontaneously, it spreads far and wide with its vast branches, %0athe ends of which bend downwards into the ground to such a %0adegree, that they take fresh root in the course of a year, and %0athus form a new plantation around the parent stock, traced in %0aa circular form, just as though it had been the work of the %0aornamental gardener. Within the bowers thus formed, the %0ashepherds take up their abode in the summer, the space occu- %0apied by them being, at once, overshadowed and protected by %0a%0aFee remarks, that the words of Pliny dc not afford us any means of %0ajudi^ing precisely what tree it was that he understood by the name of ebony. %0aHe borrows his account mainly from Theophrastus. %0a%0aIt is not known to what tree he alludes. %0a%0aThis account of the Ficus Indica, or religiosa, known to us as the %0abanian-tree, is borrowed entirely from Theophrastus. Fee remarks, how- %0aever, that he is wrong in some of his statements, for that the leaves are not %0acvesceTit-shaped, but oblong and pointed, and that the fruit has not a plea- %0asant flavour, and is only eaten by tlie birds. %0a%0a%0a%0a110 %0a%0a%0a%0apliny's natural history. %0a%0a%0a%0a[Book XII, %0a%0a%0a%0athe bulwark which the tree thus throws around ; a most %0agraceful sight, whether we stand beneath and look upwards, %0aor whether we view its arcaded foliage from a distance. The %0ahigher branches, however, shoot upwards to a very consider- %0aable height, and, by their number, form quite a grove, spring, %0aing aloft from the vast trunk of the parent tree, which %0aoverspreads, very frequently, a space of sixty paces in extent, %0awhile the shade that is thrown by it will cover as much as %0aa couple of stadia. The broad leaves of the tree have just the %0ashape of an Amazonian buckler; and hence it is that the %0afruit, from being quite covered by the leaves, is greatly impeded %0ain its growth. The fruit, indeed, of this tree is but scanty, %0aand never exceeds a bean in size ; being ripened, however, by %0athe rays of the sun, as these penetrate the leaves, the figs are %0aremarkable for their singular lusciousness, and are quite worthy %0aof the marvellous tree by which they are produced. These %0afig-trees are found, more particularly, in the vicinity of the %0ariver Acesines.-^^ %0a%0aCHAP. 12. (6.) — THE pala: the frtjit calleb aeiena. %0a%0aThere is another tree in India, of still larger size, and %0aeven more remarkable for the size and sweetness of its fruit, %0aupon which the sages" of India live. The leaf of this tree %0aresembles, in shape, the wing of a bird, being three cubits in %0alength, and two in breadth. It puts forth its fruit from the %0abark, a fruit remarkable for the sweetness of its juice, a single %0aone containing sufficient to satisfy four persons. The name of %0athis tree is "pala," and of the fruit, " ariena." They are foundin %0athe greatest abundance in the country of the Sydraci,^ a terri- %0atory which forms the extreme limit of the expedition of Alex- %0aander. %0a%0aThere is another*^ tree, also, very similar to this, but bearing %0aa still sweeter fruit, though very apt to cause derangement of %0a39 See B. vi. c. 23. %0a%0a^0 Sprengel and Bauhin are of opinion that the banana is the tree meant %0ahere ; Dodonseus thinks that it is the pomegranate. Thevet says that the %0apala is the paquovera of India, the fruit of which is called pacona. The %0aaccount is borrowed from Theophrastus. , %0a%0a*i The Gymnosophists, or Brahmins. %0a%0a^ Called Syndraci in B. vi. c. 25, %0a%0aIt is not improbable that the Tamarindus Indica of Linnseus is the %0atree here alluded to : though M.

There is one which resembles the terebinth ^* in every %0arespect, except the fruit, which is very similar to the almond, %0athough less in size, and remarkable for its extreme sweetness. %0aThis tree was met with in Bactria, and some persons looked %0aupon it as a variety of the terebinth, rather than as bearing a %0astrong resemblance to it.

The grains, he says, grow in clusters, and not %0ain a husk or po^ and he remarks, that the long pepper and the black pep- %0aper, of which the white is only a variety divested of the outer coat, are %0adistinct species. He also observes, that the real long pepper, the Piper %0alonguni ot Linnaeus, was not known to the ancients. %0a%0a%0a%0a112 %0a%0a%0a%0aPLINY 3 NATUllAL UISTOET. %0a%0a%0a%0a[Book XII. %0a%0a%0a%0aalthough, iudccd, it has been alleged by some authors that they %0aonlj- grow on the slopes of Caucasus which lie exposed to the %0aBun. The seeds, however, differ from those of the juniper, in %0abeing enclosed in small pods similar to those whicli we see in %0athe kidney-bean. These pods are picked before they open, %0aand when dried in the sun, make what we call " long pepper." %0aBut if allowed to ripen, they will open gradually, and when %0aarrived at maturity, discover the white pepper ; if left ex- %0aposed to the heat of the sun, this becomes Avrinkled, and changes %0aits colour. Even these productions, however, are subject to %0atheir own peculiar infirmities, and are apt to become blasted %0aby the inclemency of the weather ; in which case the seeds %0aare found to be rotten, and mere husks. These abortive seeds are %0aknown by the name of " bregma," a word which in the Indian %0alanguage signifies " dead." Of all the various kinds of pepper, %0athis is the most pungent, as well as the very lightest, and is %0aremarkable for the extreme paleness of its colour. That which %0ais black is of a more agreeable flavour ; but the white pepper %0ais of a milder quality than either. %0a%0aThe. root of this tree is not, as many persons have imagined, %0athe same as the substance known as zimpiberi, or, as some call %0ait, zingiberi, or ginger, although it is very like it in taste. %0aEor ginger, in fact, grows in Arabia and in Troglodytica, in %0avarious cultivated spots, being a small plant*" with a white %0aroot. This plant is apt to decay very speedily, although it is %0aof intense pungency ; the price at which it sells is six denarii %0aper pound. Long pepper is very easily adulterated with %0aAlexandi-ian mustard ; its price is fifteen denarii per pound, %0awhile that of white pepper is seven, and of black, four. It is %0aquite surprising that the use of pepper has come so much into %0afashion, seeing that in other substances which we use, it is %0asometimes their sweetness, and sometimes their appearance that %0ahas attracted our notice; whereas, pepper has nothing in it %0athat can plead as a recommendation to either fruit or berry, its %0aonly desirable quality being a certain pungency ; and yet it is %0afor this that we import it all the way from India!

Italy/^ too, now possesses a species of %0apepper-tree, somewhat larger than the myrtle, and not very %0aunlike it. The bitterness of the grains is similar to that which %0awe may reasonably suppose to exist in the Indian pepper %0awhen newly gathered ; but it is wanting in that mature fla- %0avour which the Indian grain acquires by exposure in the sim, %0aand, consequently, bears no resemblance to it, either in colour %0aor the wrinkled appearance of the seeds. Pepper is adulterated %0awith juniper berries, which have the property, to a marvellous %0adegree, of assuming the pungency of pepper. In reference to %0aits weight, there are also several methods of adulterating it. %0a%0aCHAP. 15. CAKXOPHYLLON, LTCION, AND THE CHIEONIAN %0a%0aPYXACANTHTJS. %0a%0aThere is, also, in India another grain which bears a consi- %0aderable resemblance to pepper, but is longer and more brittle ; %0ait is known by the name of caryophyllon.®^ It is said that %0athis grain is produced in a sacred grove in India ; with us it %0ais imported for its aromatic perfume. The same country pro- %0aduces, also, a thorny shrub, with grains which bear a resem- %0ablance to pepper, and are of a remarkably bitter taste. The %0aleaves of this shrub are small, like those of the Cyprus ; ^ the %0abranches are three cubits in length, the bark pallid, and the %0aroots wide-spreading and Avoody, and of a colour resembling %0athat of boxwood.

AVhen used for sacred %0apurposes, it is steeped in wine, upon which it emits a still %0amore powerful odour. The tree is a native of both India and %0aArabia, as well as Media and Babylon ; some persons give to %0athe bdellium that is imported by way of Media, the name of %0aperaticum.^' This last is remarkable for its brittleness, while, %0aat the same time, it is harder and more bitter than the other %0akinds ; that of India, on the other hand, is raoister, and gummy. %0aThis last sort is adulterated by means of almonds, while the %0avarious other kinds are falsified with the bark of scordastura, %0athat being the name of a tree*® the gum of which strongly re- %0asembles bdellium. These adulterations, however, are to he %0adetected — and let it suffice to mention it here, in relation to all %0aother perfumes as well — by the smell, the colour, the weight, %0athe taste, and the action of fire. The bdellium of Bactriana %0ais shining and dry, and covered with numerous white spots %0aresembling the finger-nails ; besides which, it should be of a %0acertain weight, heavier or lighter than which it ought not to %0abe.

The trees in these %0aregions are of a marvellous nature ; for, corroded by the action %0aof the salt, and bearing a considerable resemblance to vegeta- %0able substances that have been thrown up and abandoned by %0athe tide, they are seen to embrace the arid sands of the sea- %0ashore with their naked roots, just like so many polypi. When %0athe tide rises, buffeted by the waves, there they stand, fixed %0aand immoveable ; nay, more, at high water they are completely %0acovered ; a fact which proves to conviction, that they derive %0atheir nutriment from the salt contained in the water. The %0asize of these trees is quite marvellous ; in appearance they %0astrongly resemble the arbute ; the fruit, which on the outside %0ais very similar to the almond, has a spiral kernel within.^ %0a%0aCHAP. 21.

Thus do their very %0atrees afford clothing for the people of India. In the islands of %0aTylos, there is also another tree, with a blossom like the white %0aviolet in appearance, though four times as large, but it is %0adestitute of smell, a very remarkable fact in these climates. %0a%0aCHAP. 23.

Ttie %0aprice of it is five denarii per pound. %0a%0aCHAP. 26. NARD. THE TWELVE VARIETIES OF THE PLANT. %0a%0aOf the leaf, which is that of the nard," it is only right to %0appeak somewhat more at length, as it holds the principal place %0aamong our unguents. The nard is a shrub with a heavy, %0athick root, but short, black, brittle, and yet unctuous as well ; %0a%0aAccording to most commentators, this is the Costus Arabicus of Lin- %0anaius. Dioscoridcs mentions three varieties of costus : the Arabian, whic^ %0ais of the best quality, and is white and odoriferous; the Indian, which is %0ablack and smooth ; and the Syrian, which is of the colour of wax, dusky, and %0aBtrono' smelling. Fee, however, doubts whether the modern costus is the %0aSiirae'thing as that of the ancients ; for, as he says, although it has a sweet %0aodour, it does not deserve the appellation of a " precious aromatic," which %0awe find constantly given to it by the ancients. %0a'8 See B. vi. c. 23. %0a%0a™ It is probable that the nard of the ancients, from which they extracted %0athe famous nard-oil, was not the same plant whicli we know as the Indian %0anard, or Andropogon nardus of Linnaeus. Indeed, it has been pretty con. %0aclusively established bv Sir William Jones, in his "Asiatic Researches," %0athat the Valeriana Jatamansi is the plant from which they obtained the oil. %0aAmong the Hindoos, it is known as djatamansi, and by the Arabs under %0athe name of sombul, or " spike," from the fact of the base being surrounded %0awith ears or spikes, whence, probably, the Roman appellation. This spe- %0acies of valerian grows in the more distant and mountainous parts of Iudia,_ %0aBootan and Nepaul, for instance. %0a%0a%0a%0a120 %0a%0a%0a%0aflint's natukal history. [Book XII. %0a%0a%0a%0ait has a musty smell, too, very much like that of the cyperus, %0awith a sharp, acrid taste, the leaves being small, and growing %0ain tufts. The heads of the nard spread out into ears ; hence %0ait is that nard is so famous for its two-fold production, the %0aspike or ear, and the leaf. There is another kind, again, that %0agrows on the banks of the Ganges, but is altogether con- %0ademned, as being good for nothing; it bears the name of %0aozsenitis, ^ and emits a fetid odour. Nard is adulterated %0awith a sort of plant called pseudo-nard,"' which is found %0agrowing everywhere, and is known by its thick, broad leaf, %0aand its sickly colour, which inclines to white. It is so- %0aphisticated, also, by being mixed with the root of the genuine %0anard, which adds very considerably to its weight. Gum is %0aalso used for the same purpose, antimony, and cyperus ; or, %0aat least, the outer coat of the cyperus. Its genuineness is tested %0aby its lightness, the redness of its colour, its sweet smell, and %0athe taste more particularly, which parches the mouth, and %0aleaves a pleasant flavour behind it ; the price of spikenard is %0aone hundred denarii per pound. %0a%0aLeaf ^- nard varies in price according to the size ; for that %0awhich is known by the name of hadrosphaerum, consisting of %0athe larger leaves, sells at forty denarii per pound ; when the %0aleaves are smaller, it is called mesosphserum, and is sold at %0asixty. But that which is considered the most valuable of all, %0ais known as microsphaerum, and consists of the very smallest %0aof the leaves ; it sells at seventy-five denarii per pound. All %0athese varieties of nard have an agreeable odour, but it is most %0apowerful when fresh. If the nard is old when gathered, that %0awhich is of a black colour is considered the best. %0a%0aIn our part of the world, the Syrian^ nard is held in the %0a%0a80 From the Greek, o^aiva, " a putrid sore." Fee suggests that this %0amay have been the Nardus hadrosphaerum of the moderns. %0a%0a81 Fee supposes that this is not lavender, as some have thought, hut the %0aAllium victorialis of modern naturalists, which is still mixed with the nard %0afrom the Andropogon. He doubts the possibility of its having been adul- %0aterated with substances of such a different nature as those mentioned here %0aby Pliny. %0a%0a82 Fee is of opinion, that the Greek writers, from whom Pliny copied %0athis passage, intended to speak of the ears of nard, or spikenard. %0a%0a83 According to Dioscorides, this appellation only means such nard as ii %0acultivated in certain mountains of India which look toward Syria, and %0awhich, according to that author, was the best nard of all. Dalechamps and %0a•liardouin, however, ridicule this explanation of the term. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 27.] %0a%0a%0a%0aASAETJM, OB FOAL FOOT. %0a%0a%0a%0a121 %0a%0a%0a%0anext highest esteem next to this; then the Gallic;®* and in %0athe third place, that of Crete, which by some persons is %0acalled "agrion," and by others "phu."

All these kinds of %0anard, however, are to be reckoned as herbs, with the exception %0aof Indian nard. Of these, the Gallic kind is pulled up along %0awith the root, and washed in wine ; after which it is di'ied in %0athe shade, and wrapped up in paper, in small parcels. It is %0anot very different from the Indian nard, but is lighter than %0athat of Syria ; the price at which it sells is three denarii per %0apound. The only way of testing the leaves of all these %0avarieties of nard, is to see that they are not brittle and parched, %0ainstead of being dried naturally and gradually. Together %0awith the nard that grows in Gaul, there always springs up %0aa herb, which is known by the name of hirculus, or the %0a"little goat," on account of its offensive smell, it being very %0asimilar to that of the goat. This herb, too, is very much used %0ain the adulteration of nard, though it differs from it in the %0afact that it has no stem, and its leaves are smaller ; the root, %0atoo, is not bitter, and is entirely destitute of smell. %0a%0aCHAP. 27.

It is of a warm %0aand vinous flavour, and blossoms twice a year, growing upon %0ahiU sides that are densely shaded. The best kind is that found %0ain Pontus, and the next best that of Phiygia ; that of lUyri- %0acum being only of third-rate quality.

This plant, also, is plucked along with %0athe root, and is carefully pressed together witli the hands ; for %0ait very soon becomes brittle. That kind is held in the highest %0aesteem, the leaves of which bear a strong resemblance to those %0aof the pomegranate, being free from wrinkles, and of a red %0acolour. The second quality is that which is of a pallid hue. %0aThat which has a green, grassy appearance, is not so good, %0aand the white is the worst of aU ; it assumes this appearance %0awhen old. The price of clustered amomum is sixty denarii per %0apound, but in dust it sells at only fortj^-nine. Amomum is pro- %0aduced, also, in that part of Armenia which is known as Otene ; %0aas, also, in Media and Pontus.

That which is of a very green colour, %0aimctuous, with sharp angles, and very difficult to break, is the %0amost highly esteemed of all. The next best is of a reddish %0awhite tint, while that of third-rate quality is shorter and %0ablacker, the worst of all being mottled and friable, and emit- %0ating but little smell ; which, in its genuine'^ state ought to be %0avery similar to costum.

Bonastre, " Journal de Pharmacie," May, 1828, is of opinion, that the %0aword cardamomum signifies " amomum in pods," the Egyptian kardh %0ameaning "pod," or " husk." It is, however, more generally supposed, %0athat the Greek word, Knpcia, " heart," enters into its composition. %0a%0a" Verus" seems a preferable reading here to "vero," which has been %0aadopted by Sillig. %0a%0a" See c. 42 of the present Book. %0a%0a%0a%0a124 %0a%0a%0a%0aFlint's natueal histoet. %0a%0a%0a%0a[Book XII, %0a%0a%0a%0acommon with the country of the Troglodytac. (14.) There ii %0ano country in the world that produces frankincense except %0aArabia/^ and, indeed, not the whole of that. Almost ia the %0avery centre of that region, are the Atramitce,''* a community of %0athe Sabffii, the capital of whose kingdom is Sabota, a place %0asituate on a lofty mountain. At a distance of eight stations %0a. from this is the incense-bearing region, known by the name %0aof Saba. The Greeks say that the word signifies a " secret %0amystery." This district looks towards the north-east, and %0ais rendered inaccessible by rocks on every side, whUe it is %0abounded on the right by the sea, from which it is shut out by %0acliffs of tremendous height. The soil of this territory is said %0ato be of a milky white, a little inclining to red. The forests %0aextend twenty schceni in length, and half that distance in %0abreadth. The length of the schoenus, according to the esti- %0amate of Eratosthenes, is forty stadia, or, in other words, five %0amiles ; some persons, however, have estimated the schoenus at %0ano more than thirty-two stadia. In this district some lofty %0ahills take their rise, and the trees, which spring up sponta- %0aneously, run downwards along the declivities to the plains. %0aIt is generallj^ agreed that the soil is argillaceous, and that %0athe springs which there take their rise are but few in number, %0aand of a nitrous quality. Adjoining are the Minaei, the people %0aof another community, through whose country is the sole tran- %0asit for the frankincense, along a single narrow road. The %0a%0a95 Virgil, Georg. B. ii. 1. 139, mentions Panchaia, in Arabia, as being %0amore especially tbe country of frankincense. That region corresponds with %0athe modern Yemen. It is, however, a well-ascertained fact, that it grows %0ain India as well, and it is supposed that the greater part of it used by %0athe ancients was in reality imported from that country. The Indian in- %0acense is the product of a tree belonging to the terebinth class, named by %0aRoxburgh, who first discovered it, Boswellia thurifera. It is more espe- %0acially found in the mountainous parts of India. On the other hand, it has %0abeen asserted that the Arabian incense was tbe product of a coniferous tree, %0aeither the Juniperus Lycia, the Juniperus Phoenicea, or the Juniperus %0athurifera of Linnaeus. But, as Fee justly remarks, it would appear more %0areasonable to look among the terebinths of Arabia for the incense tree, if %0aone of tliat class produces it in India, and more especially because the coni- %0aferous trees produce only resins, while the terebinths produce gum resins, %0ato which class of vegetable products frankincense evidently belonged. In %0acommerce, the gum resin, Oiibanum, the produce of the Boswellia serrata, %0aand imported from the Levant, bears the name of frankincense. %0a%0a98 Sec B. vi. c. 32.

It is the Sahaei alone, and no other %0apeople among the Arabians, that behold the incense-tree ; and, %0aindeed, not all of them, for it is said that there are not more %0athan three thousand families which have a right tQ claim that %0aprivilege, by virtue of hereditary succession; and that for this %0areason those persons are called sacred, and are not allowed, %0awhile pruning the trees or gathering the harvest, to receive, %0aany pollution, cither by intercourse with women, or coming in %0acontact with the dead ; by these religious observances it is %0athat the price of the commodity is so considerably enhanced. %0aSome persons, however, say, that the right of gathering in- %0acense in the forests belongs to all these people in common, %0awhile others again state, that they take their turns year by %0ayear. %0a%0aCHAP. 31. THE TREES THAT BEAR FRANKINCENSE. %0a%0aNor is it by any means agreed what is the appearance of %0athe incense-tree. We have sent several expeditions against %0aA.rabia, and the Roman arms have penetrated into the greater %0apart of that country ; indeed, Caius Csesar.''^ the son of Augus- %0atus, even earned considerable renown there ; and yet this tree %0ahas been described by no Latin writer, at least that I know %0aof. The descriptions given of it by the Greek writers vary %0avery considerably : some of them say that it has exactly the %0aleaf of the pear-tree, only somewhat smaller, and of a grass- %0agrccn colour. Others, again, say, that it has a rather reddish %0aleaf, like that of the mastich, and others, that it is a kind of %0aterebinth,'* and that King Antigonus, to whom a branch of it %0awas brought, was of that opinion. King Juba, in the work %0awhich he wrote and dedicated to Caius Ca;sar, the son of %0aAugustus, who was inflamed by the wide-spread rcno^Ti of %0aArabia, states, that the tree has a spiral stem, and that the %0abranches bear a considerable resemblance to those of the Pontic %0amaple, whUe it secretes a sort of juice very similar to that of %0a%0a" See B. vi. cc. 31 and 32. Tie was the son cf Agrippa and Julia, the %0adaughter of Augustus, by whom he was adopted. %0a%0aThis seems the most probable among these various surmises and con- %0ajectures. %0a%0a%0a%0a126 %0a%0a%0a%0aPLINr's NATUEAL HISTORY. %0a%0a%0a%0a[Book XII. %0a%0a%0a%0athe almond-tree. Such, he says, is the appearance of the tree %0aas seen in Carmania and Egypt, where it Avas introduced and %0aplanted under the auspices of the Ptolemies when reigning %0athere. It is well known that it has a bark not unlike that of %0athe laurel, and, indeed, some persons have asserted that their %0aleaves are similar. At all events, such was the case with the %0atree as it grew at Sardes : for the kings of Asia also took con- %0asiderable care to have it planted there. The ambassadors %0awho in my time have come to Home from Arabia, have made %0aall these matters more uncertain, even, than they were before; %0aa thing at which we may justly be surprised, seeing that %0asome sprigs even of the incensc-treo have been brought among %0aus, from which we have some reason to conclude that the %0aparent tree is round and tapering, and that it puts forth its %0ashoots from a trunk that is entirely free from knots. %0a%0aCHAP. 32. VAKIOTJS KINDS OF FRANKINCENSE. %0a%0aIn former times, when they had fewer opportunities of %0aselling it, they used to gather the frankincense only once a %0ayear ; but at the present day, as there is a much greater de- %0amand for it, there is a second crop as well. The first, and %0awhat we may call the natural, vintage, takes place about the %0arising of the Dog-star, a period when the heat is most intense ; %0aon which occasion they cut the tree where the bark appears %0ato be the fullest of juice, and extremely thin, from being dis- %0atended to the greatest extent. The incision thus made is gra- %0adually extended, but nothing is removed ; the consequence of %0awhich is, that an unctuous foam oozes forth, which gradually %0acoagulates and thickens. When the nature of the locahty re- %0aquires it, this juice is received upon mats of palm-leaves, though %0ain some places the space around the tree is made hard by being %0awell rammed down for the purpose. The frankincense that %0ais gathered after the former method, is in the purest state, %0athough that which falls on the ground is the heaviest in %0aweight : that which adheres to the tree is pared off with an %0airon instrument, which accounts for its being found mingled %0awith pieces of bark. %0a%0aThe forest is allotted in certain portions, and such is the %0amutual probity of the owners, that it is quite safe from all %0adepredation ; indeed, there is no one left to watch the trees %0aafter the incisions are made, and yet no one is ever known to %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 32.] TABIOTIS KINDS OF FRANKINCENSE. 1 27 %0a%0aplunder his neighbour. But, by Hercules! at Alexandria, %0awhere the incense is dressed for sale, the workshops can never %0abe guarded with sufficient care ; a seal is even placed upon the %0aworkmen's aprons, and a mask put upon the head, or else a %0anet with very close meshes, while the people are stripped %0anaked before they are allowed to leave work. So true it is %0athat punishments afford less security among us than is to be %0afound by these Arabians amid their woods and forests ! The %0aincense which has accumulated during the summer is gathered %0ain the autumn : it is the purest of all, and is of a white colour. %0aThe second gathering takes place in spring, incisions being %0amade in the bark for that purpose during the winter : this, %0ahowever, is of a red colour, and not to be compared with the %0aother incense. The first, or superior kind of incense, is known %0aas carfiathum,'^ the latter is called dathiathum. It is thought, %0aalso, that the incense which is gathered from the tree while %0ayoung is the whitest, though the produce of the old trees has %0athe most powerful smell ; some persons, too, have an impres- %0asion that the best incense is found in the islands, but Juba %0aasserts that no incense at all is grown there. %0a%0aThat incense which has hung suspended in globular drops is %0aknown to us as "male" frankincense, although it is mostly %0athe case that we do not use the term " male" except in con- %0atradistinction to the word " female :" it has been attributed, %0ahowever, to religious scruples, that the name of the other sex %0awas not employed as a denomination for this substance. Some %0apersons, again, are of opinion that the male frankincense has %0abeen so called from its resemblance' to the testes of the male. %0aThe incense, however, that is the most esteemed of all is that %0awhich is mammose, or breast-shaped, and is produced when %0aone drop has stopped short, and another, following close upon %0ait, has adhered, and united with it. I find it stated that one %0aof these lumps lascd to make quite a handful, at a time when %0amen displayed less eagerness to gather it, and it was allowed %0amore time to accumulate.

After Alexandria had conquered Arabia, %0ahe despatched to Leonides a ship freighted with frankincense, %0aand sent him word, requesting that he would now worship the %0agods without stint or limit. %0a%0aThe incense, after being collected, is carried on camels' %0abacks to Sabota,' at which place a single gate is left open for %0aits admission. To deviate from the high road while convey- %0aing it, the laws have made a capital offence. At this place the %0apriests take by measure, and not by weight, a tenth part in %0ahonour of their god, whom they call Sabis ; indeed, it is not %0aallowable to dispose of it before this has been done : out of %0athis tenth the public expenses are defrayed, for the divinity %0agenerously entertains all those strangers who have made a cer- %0atain number of days' journey in coming thither.

MYERH. %0a%0aAccording to some authors, myrrh is the produce of a tree %0athat grows in the same forests as the incense- tree, though %0amost say that they grow in different places : but the fact is %0athat myrrh grows in many parts of Arabia, as will be seen %0awhen we come to speak of the several varieties of it. A sort %0athat is highly esteemed is brought from the islands'* also, and %0athe Sabaii even cross the sea to procure it in the country of %0athe Troglodytoc.

In c. 19 of the present Book. %0a%0a" It is supposed to bo the product of an amyris, but is not now esteemed %0aas a perfume ; but is used in medicine as a toiiic. Forskhal has attributed %0ato the Amyris kataf, or kafal, the production of myrrh. According to %0aEhrcnbergj'a very similar tree, though constituting a different species, the %0aBalsamodendrum myrrha, also produces this substance.

Some authors have said that the bark %0ais smooth like that of the arbute, others, that it is rough and %0acovered with thorns : it has the leaf of the olive, but more ■wavy, %0awith sharp points at the edges : Juba says, however, that it %0aresembles the leaf of the olusatrum. Some again say that it %0aresembles the juniper,'^ only that it is rougher and bristlmg %0awith thorns, and that the leaves are of a rounder shape, though %0athey have exactly the taste of the juniper. There have been %0asome writers who have incorrectly asserted that both myrrh %0aand frankincense are the product of the same tree. %0a%0aCHAP. 35. THE NATUEE AND VAEIOUS KINDS OF MYEKH. %0a%0aIncisions are made in the myrrh-tree also twice a year, and at %0athe same season as in the incense-tree ; but in the case of the %0amyrrh- tree they are all made the way up from the root as far as %0athe branches which are able to bear it. The tree spontaneously %0aexudes, before the incision is made, a liquid which bears the %0aname of stacte,^^ and to which there is no myrrh that is supe- %0arior. Second only in quality to this is the cultivated myrrh : %0aof the wild or forest kind, the best is that which is gathered in %0asummer. They give no tithes of myrrh to the god, because it %0ais the produce of other countries as well ; but the growers pay %0athe fourth part of it to the king of the Gebanitse. Myrrh is %0abought up indiscriminately by the common people, and then %0apacked into bags ; but our perfumers separate it without any %0adifficulty, the principal tests of its goodness being its unctuous- %0aness and its aromatic smell.

There is a white myrrh also, which is produced in %0aonly one spot, and is carried for sale to the city of Messalum. %0aThe Troglodytic myrrh is tested by its unctuousness, and its %0apeculiai'ly dry appearance : it has also a dirty, rough look %0awith it, but is more acrid than tlie other kinds. The Sambra- %0acenian myrrh has none of these faults, and is more sightly in %0aappearance than any of them, though it is far from being %0aso powerful. In general, however, the proof of its goodness %0aconsists in its being separated in little pieces of uneven shape, %0aformed by the concretion of a whitish juice, which dries up %0aUttle by little. When broken it ought to exhibit white marks %0alike the finger-nails, and to be slightly bitter to the taste. %0aThat of second quality is of a mottled appeai'ance within ; %0awhile of worse quality is that which is of a black colour %0awithin ; the very Avorst of all is that which is black on the %0aoutside as well. %0a%0aThe price of myrrh varies according to the number of pur- %0achasers. Stacte is sold at prices which vary from three de- %0anarii to forty per pound, while the very highest price of the %0acultivated myrrh is eleven denarii. Erythraean myrrh, the %0asame, it is pretended, as Arabian mj^rrh, is sixteen denarii per %0apound, Troglodytic also, is sixteen denarii ; and that known as %0aodoraria, or odoriferous myrrh, sells at fourteen. Myrrh is %0aadulterated with pieces of mastich, and other gums ; it is also %0adrugged with the juice of wild cucumber, in order to produce %0aa. certain bitterness, and with litharge for the purpose of in- %0acreasing its weight. Other sophistications may be discovered %0aon tasting it, and the gum will adhere to the teeth. But the %0a%0abeing not a distinct kind, but a simple variety in appearance only. He %0athinks, also, that Pliny may very possibly be describing several distinct %0aresinous products, under the one name of myrrh. An account of these %0avarious districts will be found in B. vi. c. 32. %0a%0aHardouin suggests that it may be so called from the island of Dia, %0amentioned by Strabo, B. xvi. %0a%0a" Collatitia." The reading, however, is very doubtful. %0a%0aK 2 %0a%0a%0a%0a132 %0a%0a%0a%0aflint's natural niSTOET. %0a%0a%0a%0a[Book XII. %0a%0a%0a%0acleverest mode of adulterating it is with Indian myrrh,^" a %0asubstance wliicli is gathered from a certain pnckly shrub which %0agrows there.

(17.) MASTICH. %0a%0aThe transition, therefore,^^ is very easy to mastich, which %0agrows upon another prickly shrub of India and Arabia, known %0aby the name of laina. Of mastich as well there are two dif- %0aferent kinds ; for in Asia and Greece there is also found a herb %0awhich puts forth leaves from the root, and bears a thistly %0ahead, resembling an apple, and full of seeds. Upon an inci- %0asion being made in the upper part of this plant drops distil %0afrom it, which can hardly be distinguished from the genuine %0amastich. There is, again, a third sort,""'' found in Pontus, but %0amore like bitumen than anything else. The most esteemed, %0ahowever, of all these, is the white mastich of Chios, the price %0aof which is twenty denarii per pound, while the black mastich %0asells at twelve. It is said that the mastich of Chios exudes %0afrom the lentisk in the form of a sort of gum : like frank- %0aincense, it is adulterated with resin. %0a%0aCHAP, 37. LADANUM AND STOBOLON. %0a%0a, Arabia, too, still, boasts of her ladanum.'^ Many writers %0a%0a20 "What this was is now unknown. Fee suggests that it may have been %0abdellium, which is found in considerable quantities in the myrrh that is %0aimported at the present day. %0a%0a'■^1 This is most probably the meaning of Pliny's expression — "Ergo %0atransit in mastichen ;" though Hardouin reads it as meaning that myrrh %0asometimes degenerates to mastich : and Fee, understanding the passage in %0athe same sense, remarks that the statement is purely fabulous. Mastich, %0ahe says, is the produce of the Pistacia lentiscus of Linnaeus, which abouncb %0ain Greece and the other parts of southern Europe. The greater part of %0athe mastich of commerce comes from the island of Chio. It is impossible %0ato conjecture to what plant Pliny here alludes, with the head of a thistle. %0a%0a2- This kind, Fee says, is quite unknown to the moderns. %0a%0a23 This substance is still gathered from the Cistus creticus of Linnseus, %0awhich is supposed to be the same as the plant leda, mentioned by Plmj- %0aIt is also most probably the same as the Cisthon, mentioned by liny m %0aB. xxiv. c. 48. It is very commonly found in Spain. The substance is %0agathered from off the leaves, not by the aid of goats, but with whips fur- %0anished with several thongs, with which the shrabs are beaten. There are %0atwo sorts of ladanum known in commerce ; the one friable, and mixed with %0aearthy substances, and known as " ladanum in tortis ;" the other black, and %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 37.] %0a%0a%0a%0aLADAITUM AKD STOBOLON. %0a%0a%0a%0a133 %0a%0a%0a%0ahave stated that this substance is the fortuitous result of an ac- %0acidental injury inflicted upon a certain odoriferous plant, under %0athe following circumstances : the goat, they say, which is in %0ageneral an animal that is exti'cmely mischievous to foliage, is %0aparticularly fond of the shrubs that are odoriferous, as if, in- %0adeed, it were really sensible of the value that is set upon %0athem. Hence it is that as the animal crops the sprouting %0ashoots of the branches which are swollen with a liquid juice %0aof remarkable sweetness, these juices drop and become min- %0agled together, and are then wiped up by the shaggy hairs of %0aits unlucky beard. Being there mingled with the dust, these %0ajuices form knots and tufts, and are then dried by the sun ; %0aand hence the circumstance is accounted for that in the lada- %0anum which is imported by us we find goats' hairs. This, %0ahowever, we are told, occurs nowhere but among the Naba- %0ataei," a people of Arabia, who border upon Syria. The more %0arecent writers call this substance by the name of stobolon, and %0astate that in the forests of Arabia the trees are broken by the %0agoats while browzing, and that the juices in consequence ad- %0ahere to their shaggy hair ; but the genuine " ladanum, they %0aassure us, comes from the island of Cyprus. I make mention of %0athis in order that every kind of odoriferous plant may be taken %0asome notice of, even though incidentally and not in the order %0aof their respetive localities. They say also that this Cyprian %0aladanum is collected in the same manner as the other, and %0athat it forms a kind of greasy substance or oesypum,-' which %0aadheres to the beards and shaggy legs of the goats ; but that %0ait is produced from the flowers of the ground-ii^y, which they %0ahave nibbled when in quest of their morning food, a time at %0awhich the whole island is covered with dew. After this, they %0asay, when the fogs are dispersed by the sun, the dust adheres %0ato their wet coats, and the ladanum is formed, which is after- %0awards taken ofl' of them with a comb. %0a%0aThere are some authors who give to the plant of Cyprus, %0afrom which it is made, the name of leda ; and hence it is that %0a%0aBoft to the fingers, the only adventitious substances in which are a little %0asand and a few hairs. %0a■* Sec B. vi. c. 32. %0a%0aFor some fiu'ther account of this substance, see B. xxix. c. 10. Filthy %0aas it was, the cesypum, or sweat and grease of sheep, was used by the %0aRoman ladies as one of their most choice cosmetics. Ovid, in his "Art of %0aLove," more than once inveighs against the use of it. %0a%0a%0a%0a134 %0a%0a%0a%0aPLTNT'a KATUEAL HI8T0ET. %0a%0a%0a%0a[Book XIL %0a%0a%0a%0a■we find it also called Icdanum. They say, also, that a viscoui %0asubstance settles upon this plant, and, that, by the aid of %0astrings wound around it, its leaves are rolled into bulls, from %0awhich a kind of cake is made. Hence it is, that in Cyprus, as %0awell as in Arabia, there are two kinds of ladanum ; the one %0anatural, and mingle'd with earth, and the other artificial : the %0aformer is friable, while the latter is of a viscous nature. %0a%0aIt is stated, also, that this substance is the produce of a %0ashrub originally found in Carmania, and propagated by plants, %0aby order of the Ptolemies, in the parts beyond Egypt ; while %0aother authorities are found, which say that it grows on the %0aincense tree, and is gathered like gum, from incisions made in %0athe bark, after which it is collected in bags of goat-skin. That %0aof the most approved quality, sells at the rate of forty asses %0aper pound. Ladanum is adulterated with myrtle berries, and %0afilth taken from the fleeces of other animals besides the goat. , %0aIf genuine, it ought to have a wild and acrid smell, in some I %0ameasure redolent of the desert places where it is produced : it %0ais dry and parched in appearance, but becomes soft the moment %0ait is touched. When ignited, it gives a brilliant flame, and %0aemits a powerful but pleasant odour ; if mixed with m}Ttle %0aberries, its spurious quality is immediately discovered by their %0acrackling in the fire. In addition to this, the genuine lada- %0anum has more grits, or stony particles, adhering to it, than %0adust. %0a%0aCHAP. 38. — mrsMKonr. %0a%0aIn Arabia, too, the olive-tree distils a sort of tear, with %0awhich the Indians make a medicament, known by the Greeks %0aas enhsemon ; it is said to be of wonderful efficacy in con- %0atracting and healing wounds and sores. These trees," situate %0aon the coasts there, are covered by the sea at high water, %0awithout the berries suffering the slightest injury, although it %0ais a well-known fact, that the salt collects upon the leaves. %0a%0aFrom the Greek tvaifiov, " styptic," or " blood-stopping."

The people of that country have a won- %0aderful regard for the perfumes of foreign parts, and import %0athem from places at a considerable distance ; so soon are men %0asated with what they have of their own, and so covetous are %0athey of what belongs to others. %0a%0aCHAP. 39. THE TREE CALLED BRITTTS. %0a%0aHence it is, that they import from the country of the %0aElymsei ^ the wood of a tree called bratus,"* which is similar in %0aappearance to a spreading cypress. Its branches are of a %0awhitish colour, and the wood, while burning, emits a pleasant %0aodour; it is highly spoken of by Claudius Cajsar, in his %0aHistory,^" for its marvellous properties. He states that the %0aParthians sprinkle the leaves of it in their drink, that its smell %0aclosely resembles that of the cedar, and that the smoke of it is %0aefficacious in counteracting the effects of smoke emitted by %0aother wood. This tree grows in the countries that lie beyond %0athe Pasitigris,'' in the territory of the city of Sittaca, upon %0aMount Zagrus. %0a%0aCUAP. 40. THE TREE CALLED STOBEXJM. %0a%0aThe Arabians import from Carmania also the wood of a %0atree called stobrura,^^ which they employ in fumigations, by %0asteeping it in palm wine, and then setting fire to it. The %0aodour first ascends to the ceiling, and then descends in volumes %0a%0a" See B. vi. c. 31. %0a%0a2f Although the savin shrub, the Juniperus Sabina of Linnaeus, bears %0athis name in Greek, it is evident, as Fee says, that Pliny does not allude %0ato it, but to a coniferous tree, as it is tliat family which produces a resinous %0awood with a balsamic odour when ignited. Bauhin and others would %0amake the tree meant to be the Thuya occidentalis of Linnaeus ; but, as Fee %0aobserves, that tree is in reality a native originally of Canada, while the %0aThuya orientalis is a native of Japan. He suggests, however, that the %0aThuya articulata of Mount Atlas may have possibly been the citrus of %0aPliny. %0a%0a^ See end of B. v. %0a%0a31 All these are mentioned in B. vi. c. 31. %0a%0a32 It is not known what wood is meant under this name.

For these %0abranches of commerce, they have opened the city of Carra," %0awhich serves as an entrepot, and from which place they were %0aformerly in the habit of proceeding to Gabba, at a distance of %0atwenty days' journey, and thence to Pala)stina, in Syria. But %0aat a later period, as Juba informs us, they began to take the %0aroad, for the purposes of this traffic, to Charax^* and the %0akingdom of the Parthians. For my own part, it would appear %0ato me that they were in the habit of importing these commo- %0adities among the Persians, even before they began to convey %0athem to SjTia or Egj'pt ; at least Herodotus bears testimony to %0athat effect, when he states that the Arabians paid a yearly %0atribute of one thousand talents, in frankincense, to the kings %0aof Persia. %0a%0aFrom Syria they bring back storax,^* which, burnt upon %0athe hearth, by its powerful smell dispels that loathing of their %0aown perfumes with which these people are affected. For in %0ageneral there are no kinds of wood in use among them, except %0athose whftch are odoriferous ; indeed, the Sabaei are in the %0ahabit of cooking their food with incense wood, while others, %0aagain, employ that of the myrrh tree ; and hence, the smoke %0aand smells that pervade their cities and villages are no other %0athan the v.ery same which, with us, proceed from the altars. %0aFor the- purpose of qualifying this powerful smell, they burn %0astorax in goat-skins, and so fumigate their dwellings. So true %0ait is, that there is no pleasure to be found, but what the con- %0atinual enjoyment of it begets loathing. They also burn this %0asubstance to drive away the serpents, which are extremely %0anumerous in the forests which bear the odoriferous trees. %0a%0aCHAP. 41.

Those who are likely to be the best %0aacquainted with the matter, assert that this country does not %0aproduce, in a Avhole year, so large a quantity of perfumes as %0awas burnt by the Emperor Nero at the funeral obsequies of %0ahis wife Poppaea. And then let us only take into account %0athe vast number of funerals that are celebrated throughout the %0awhole world each year, and the heaps of odours that are %0apiled up in honour of the bodies of the dead ; the vast quanti- %0aties, too, that are offered to the gods in single grains ; and yet, %0awhen men were in the habit of offering up to them the salted %0acake, they did not show themselves any the less propitious ; %0anay, rather, as the facts themselves prove, they were even %0amore favourable to us than they are now. But it is the sea of %0aArabia that has even a still greater right to be called " happy," %0afor it is this that furnishes us with pearls. At the very lowest %0acomputation, India, the Seres, and the Arabian Peninsula, %0awithdraw from our empire one hundred millions of sesterces %0aever)' year — so dearlj- do we pay for our luxury and our %0awomen. How large a portion, too, I should like to know, of %0aall these perfumes, really comes to the gods of heaven, and the %0adeities of the shades below ? %0a%0aCHAP. 42. (19.) — CINNAMOMUJI.'" XYLOCINNAMUM. %0a%0aFabulous antiquity, and Herodotus^® more particularly, have %0arelated that cinnamomum and cassia are fouud in the nests of %0acertain birds, and principally that of the phoenix, in the dis- %0atricts where Father Liber was brought up ; and that these sub- %0astances either fall from the inaccessible rocks and trees in %0awhich the nests ai-e built, in consequence of the weight of the %0apieces of flesh which the birds carry up, or else are brought %0adown by the aid of arrows loaded with lead. It is said, also, %0a%0a^ Because its perfumes were held in such high esteem, for burning on %0athe piles of the dead. This, of course, was done primarily to avoid the %0aoffensive smell. %0a%0a" The bark of the Cinnamomum Zeylanicum of the modern naturalists, %0athe cinuamcn-tree of Ceylon. %0a38 B. iii. %0a%0a%0a%0a138 %0a%0a%0a%0aPLIKT's NATURA-L bistoet. %0a%0a%0a%0an^ook xn. %0a%0a%0a%0athat cassia grows around certain marshes, but is protected by %0aa frightful kind of bat armed with claws, and by winged ser- %0apents as well. All these tales, however, have been evidently %0ainvented for the purpose of enhancing the prices of these %0acommodities. Another story, too, bears them company, to the %0aeffect that under the rays of the noon-day sun, the entire %0apeninsula exhales a certain indescribable perfume composed of %0aits numerous odours ; that the breezes, as they blow from it, %0aare impregnated with these odours, and, indeed, were the first %0ato announce the vicinity of Arabia to the fleets of Alexander %0athe Great, while still far out at sea. All this, however, is %0afalse ; for cinnamomum, or cinnamum, which is the same thing, %0agrows in the country of the Ethiopians,*" who are united by %0aintermarriages with the Troglodyta). These last, after buying %0ait of their neighbours, carry it over vast tracts of sea, upon %0arafts, which are neither steered by rudder, nor drawn or %0aimpelled by oars or sails. Nor yet are they aided by any of the %0aresources of art, man alone, and his daring boldness, standing %0ain place of all these ; in addition to which, they choose the %0awinter season, about the time of the equinox, for their voyage, %0afor then a south easterly wind is blowing ; these winds guide %0athem in a straight course from gulf to gulf, and after they %0ahave doubled the promonotory of Arabia, the north east wind %0acarries them to a port of the Gebanitae, known by the name of %0aOcilia.''*' Hence it is that they steer for this port in preference ; %0aand they say that it is almost five years before the mer- %0achants are able to effect their return, while many perish on %0athe voyage. In return for their wares, they bring back arti- %0acles of glass and copper, cloths, buckles, bracelets, and neck- %0alaces ; hence it is that this traffic depends more particularly %0aupon the capricious tastes and inclinations of the female sex. %0a%0aThe cinnamon shrub" is only two cubits in height, at the %0amost, the lowest being no more than a palm in height.

M. Bonastre is of opinion that %0athe nutmeg-tree was known to the ancients under this name ; but, as Fee %0aobserves, the nutmeg could never have been taken for a bark, and cinnaraoa %0ais described as such in the ancient writers. He inclines to think that their %0acinnamon was really the bark of a species of amyris. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 42.] %0a%0a%0a%0aCINNAMOMTJM. %0a%0a%0a%0a139 %0a%0a%0a%0asuckers. It has then all the appearance of being dry and %0a•withered, and wliilo it is green it has no odour at all. The leaf ia %0alike that of wild marjoram, and it thrives best in dry localities, %0abeing not so prolific in rainy weather ; it requires, also, to be %0akept constantly clipped. Though it grows on level ground, it %0athrives best among tangled brakes and brambles, and hence %0ait is extremely difficult to be gathered. It is never gathered %0aunless with the permission of the god, by whom some suppose %0aJupiter to be meant; the Ethiopians, however, call him %0aAssabinus." They offer the entrails of forty-four oxen, goats, %0aand rams, when they implore his permission to do so, but after %0aall, they are not allowed to work at it before sunrise or after %0asunset. A priest divides the branches with a spear, and sets %0aaside one portion of them for the god ; after which, the dealer %0astores away the rest in lumps. There is another account given, %0awhich states that a division is made between the gatherers and %0athe sun, and that it is divided into three portions, after which %0alots are twice drawn, and the share which falls to the sun is %0aleft there, and forthwith ignites spontaneously. %0a%0aThe thinnest parts in the sticks, for about a palm in length, %0aare looked upon as producing the finest cinnamon ; the part %0athat comes next, though not quite so long, is the next best, %0aand so on downwards. The worst of aU is that which is %0anearest the roots, from the circumstance that in that part %0athere is the least bark, the portion that is the most esteemed : %0ahence it is that the upper part of the tree is preferred, there %0abeing the greatest proportion of bark there. As for the wood, %0ait is held in no esteem at all, on account of the acrid taste %0awhich it has, like that of wild marjoram ; it is known as %0axylocinnamum." The price of cinnamomum is ten denarii per %0apound. Some writers make mention of two kinds of cinna- %0amon, the white and the black : the white was the one that was %0aformerly preferred, but now, on the contrary, the black is held %0ain the highest estimation, and the mottled, even, is preferred to %0athe white. The most certain test, however, of the goodness ol %0acinnamon is its not being rough, and the fact that the pieces %0awhen rubbed together do not readily crumble to powder. That %0awhich is soft is more particularly rejected, which is the case, %0aalso, when the outer bark too readily falls off. %0a%0a*- See c. 33 of the present Book, and the Note. %0a43 Or " wood of cinnamon." %0a%0a%0a%0a140 %0a%0a%0a%0apli>y's natcuax uisjouy. %0a%0a%0a%0a[Book.

Indeed, we find it stated by %0asome authors, that the south winds that prevail in these parts %0aare sometimes so hot as to set the forests on fire. The Em- %0aperor Vespasianus Augustus was the first to dedicate in the %0atemples of the Capitol and the goddess Peace chaplets of ciA- %0anamon inserted in embossed^'' gold. I, myself, once saw in the %0atemple of the Palatium, which his wife Augusta** dedicated to %0aher husband the late emperor Augustus, a root of cinnamon %0aof great weight, placed in a patera of gold : from it drops used %0ato distil every year, which congealed in hard grains. It re- %0amained there until the temple was accidentally destroyed by fire. %0a%0aCHAP. 43. — CASSIA. %0a%0aCassia*^ is a shrub also, which grows not far from the plains %0awhere cinnamon is produced, but in the mountainous locali- %0aties; the branches of it are, however, considerably thicker than %0athose of cinnamon. It is covered with a thin skin rather than %0aa bark, and, contrary to what is the case with cinnamon, it %0ais looked upon as the most valuable when the bark falls off %0aand crumbles into small pieces. The shrub is three cubits in %0aheight, and the colours which it assumes are threefold : when %0ait first shoots from the ground, for the length of a foot, it is %0awhite ; after it has attained that height, it is red for half a %0afoot, and beyond that it is black.

It is of a purple colour, and though of %0aconsiderable volume, weighs but very little in comparison ; the %0aouter coat forms into short tubes which are by no means easily %0abroken : this choice kind of cassia, the barbarians call by the %0aname of lada. There is another sort, again, which is called %0abalsaraodes,** because it has a smell like that of balsam, but it %0ais bitter ; for which reason it is more employed for medicinal %0apurposes, just as the black cassia is used for unguents. There %0ais no substance known that is subject to greater variations in %0aprice : the best qualities sell at fifty denarii per pound, others, %0aagain, at five. %0a%0a(20.) To these varieties the dealers have added another, %0awhich they call daphnoides,"* and give it the surname of isocin- %0auamon;*^ the price at which it sells is three hundred %0adenarii per pound. It is adulterated with storax, and, in %0aconsequence of the resemblance of the bark, with very small %0asprigs of laurel. Cassia is also planted in our part of the %0aworld, and, indeed, at the extreme verge of the Empire, on the %0abanks of the river Rhenus, where it flourishes when planted %0ain the vicinity of hives of bees. It has not, however, that %0ascorched colour which is produced by the excessive heat of the %0aBun ; nor has it, for the same reason, a similar smell to that %0awhich comes from the south. %0a%0aCHAP. 44.

From its name, also, it is %0aevident that it is the nut of a tree, with a leaf similar to tliat %0aof the heliptropium, which we shall have to mention when %0aspeaking of the herbs. The fruit of this tree is about the size %0aof a filbert. The kind that grows in Arabia is known as %0aSyriaca, and is white, while, on the other hand, that which %0agrows in the Thebais is black : the former is preferred for the %0aquality of the oil extracted from it, though that which is pro- %0a%0a52 A gum resin of some unknown species, but not improbably, Fee %0athinks, the produce of some of tbe Amyrides.

There are some persons who %0aprefer that of Ethiopia ^ to all of these, the nut of which is %0ablack, and not oleaginous ; it has only a very small kernel, but %0athe liquid which is extracted from it is more odoriferous than %0athat of the other kinds ; it grows, too, in a champaign, open %0acountry. It is said that the Egyptian nut is even more olea- %0aginous, being of a reddish colour ^vith. a thicker shell, and %0athat the plant, although it grows in wet, marshy spots, is %0ashorter and drier than the other kinds. The Arabian nut, %0aagain, is said to be of a green colour and of smaller size, but %0aharder and more compact, from the circumstance that it grows %0ain mountainous districts. The best of all, however, is that of %0aPetra, which comes from a city mentioned*®* on a previous %0aoccasion ; it has a black shell, but the kernel is white. The %0aperfumers, however, only extract the juices from the shells ; %0abut medical men pound the kernels, poiuing warm water on %0athem, little by little, as they do it. %0a%0aCHAP. 47.

It is gathered a little before it begins to ripen. %0aThat which is left uugathered is known as phoenicobalanus ; %0ait turns black, and has a tendency to inebriate the person who %0aeats of it.

He suggests that possi- %0ably the Elais or avoira of Guinea, the Elais Guineensis, which is found as %0afar as Upper Ejypt, and which produces a fine oil known as palm-oil, is %0ameant, or possibly the Douma Thebaica, a palm-tree frequently met with %0ain Egypt.

At a distance of one hundred %0aand fifty stadia from the Mediterranean, between Mount %0aLibanus and another mountain of no note (and not, as some %0ahave supposed, Antilibanus), there is a valley of moderate %0asize, situate in the vicinity of a lake, the marshy swamps of %0awhich are dried up every summer.

These %0aplants differ in appearance in no respect from others of their %0akind ; but the calamus, which has the more agreeable smell of %0athe two, attracts by its odour at a considerable distance, and %0ais softer to the touch than the other. The best is the kind %0awhich is not so brittle, but breaks into long flakes, and not %0ashort, like a radish. In the hollow stalk there is a substance %0alike a cobweb, which is generally known by the name of the %0a"flower:" those plants Avhich contain the most of it are %0aesteemed the best. The other tests of its goodness are its %0abeing of a black colour — those which are white not being %0aesteemed ; besides which, to be of the very best quality it %0ashould be short, thick, and pliant when broken. The price of %0athe scented calamus is eleven, and of the rush fifteen denarii %0aper pound. It is said that the sweet-scented rush is to be met %0a•with also in Campania. %0a%0aCHAP. 49.

This substiince is adulterated by means of %0asand, which has all the appearance of having adhered to it %0aduring its growth: hence it is greatly preferred when the %0apieces are extremely small, and in the purest state possible. %0aThe price of hammoniacum of the best quality is forty asses %0aper pound. %0a%0aCHAP. 50. — srnAGNOs. %0a%0aBelow these countries, and in the province of CjTcnaica, tlie %0aperfume called sphagnos'^^ is found in the highest state of per- %0afection : there are some Avho call it b)"" the name of bryon. %0aThe sphagnos of Cyprus holds the second rank, and that of %0aPhoenicia the third.

The gum resin ammoniacum is still imported %0ainto Europe from Africa and the East, in the form of drops or cakes. %0aIt is a mildly stimulating expectorant, and is said to be the produce of the %0aiJorema ammoniacum. There are still two sorts in commerce : the first %0ain large masses of a yellow, dirty colour, mingled with heterogeneous sub- %0astances, and of a plastic consistency. This is the phyrama of Pliny, or %0amixed ammoniac. The other is in tears, of irregular form and a whitish %0acolour, brittle and vitreous when broken. This is the thrauston, or %0a"friable" ammoniac of Pliny. Jackson says, that the plant which pro- %0aduces it is common in Morocco, and is called feskouk, resembling a large %0astalk of fennel The ammoniac of Morocco is not, however, imported into %0athis country, being too much impregnated with sand, in consequence of %0anot beinif gathered till it falls to the ground. %0a%0aSolinus tells us, that the tree itself is called Metops. %0a%0aIt is clear tliat, under this name, certain lichens of a hairy or fila- %0amentary nature are meant. They adhere, Dioscorides tells us, to the %0acedar, the white poplar, and the oak.

In former times it was cultivated in %0atwo gardens only, both of which belonged to the kings of that %0acountry: one of them was no more than twenty jugera in %0aextent, and the other somewhat smaller. The emperors Ves- %0apasianus and Titus had this shrub exhibited at Home ; indeed, %0ait is worthy of signal remark, that since the time of Pompeius %0aMagnus, we have been in the habit of carrying trees even in %0aour triumphal processions. At the present day this tree pays %0aus homage and tribute along with its native land, but it has %0abeen found to be of altogether a different nature to that which %0a%0a'» Or "red sceptre," probably so called from the flowers clustering along %0atlic whole h'ngth of the branches. %0a%0a" A liquid matter extracted from the beaver. %0a%0a" Generally regarded as identical with the Teucrium Marum of I.innaeu?, %0aa sweet-smelling shrub found in the south of Europe and the East, by us %0afonimonly known as "herb mastich," somewhat similar to marjoram. %0aFt'o says 'that the marum of Egypt is a kind of sage, the Salvia ^thiopis %0aof Linnaeus. %0a%0aBalsam (or balm of Mecca, as it is sometimes called) is the produce %0aof two trees, probably varieties of one another, of the terebinth family, %0abelonging to the genus Amyris. So far from bring a native solely of %0aJudtea, llruce assures us that its original country was that which produces %0amyrrh, in the ^-ieinity of Mabelniandel, and that the inhabitants use the %0awood solely for fuel. In Judiea it appears to have been cultivated solely %0ain gardi ns ; and it was this tree which produced the famous balm of Gilead %0aof Scripture. The balsam trees known to us do not at all correspond with %0aI'liny's description, as they do not resemble either the vine or myrtle, nor %0aare their leaves at all like those of rue. %0a%0a%0a%0a148 %0a%0a%0a%0aPLIXY's natural H18T0UT. %0a%0a%0a%0a[Book XII. %0a%0a%0a%0aour own as well as foreign writers had attributed to it : for, in %0afact, it bears a much stronger resemblance to the vine than to %0athe myrtle. This recent acquisition by conquest has leami'd, %0alike the vine, to be reproduced by mallet'''-shoot8, aud it %0acovers declivities just like the vine, which supports its own %0aweight without the aid of stays. When it puts Ibrth branchog %0ait is primed in a similar manner, and it thrives by being well %0araked at the roots, growing with remarkable rapidity, and %0abearing fruit at the end of three years. The leaf bears a very %0aconsiderable resemblance to that of rue, and it is an em- %0agreen. The Jews vented their rage upon this shrub just as %0athey were in the habit of doing against their own lives and %0apersons, while, on the other hand, the llomans protected it ; iu- %0adeed, combats have taken place before now in defence of a shrub. %0aAt the present day the reproduction of it has become a duty %0aof the fiscal authorities, and the plants were never known to %0ahe more numerous or of larger growth ; they never exceed the %0aheight, however, of a couple of cubits. %0a%0aThere are three different kinds of balsamum. Tlie first has %0aa thin and hair-like foliage, and is known by the name of %0aeutheriston.^' The second is of a rugged appearance, bending %0adownwards, full of branches, and more odoriferous than the %0afirst ; the name of this is trachy. The third kind is the %0aeumeces, so called, because it is taller than the others ; it has %0aa smooth, even, bark. It is the second in quality, the euthe- %0ariston being inferior to the trachy. The seed of this plant %0ahas a flavour strongly resembling that of wine ; it is of a %0areddish colour, and not without a certain amount of unctuous- %0aness ; the grains of inferior quality are lighter in weight and %0aof a greener hue : the branches of the shrub are thicker than %0athose of the myrtle. Incisions are made in it either with %0aglass, or else a sharp stone, or knives made of bone : it being %0ahighly injurious to touch the vital parts with iron, for in sucii %0acase it will immediately wither away and die. On the other %0ahand, it will allow of all the superfluous branches being pruned %0aaway with an instrument of iron even. The hand of the %0a%0a" Malleolis."

This and the other kinds, the names of which mean %0a"rough barked," and "good length," are probably only varietiea of tie %0asame tree, in different states. « %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 64.] %0a%0a%0a%0aBALSAMUM. %0a%0a%0a%0a149 %0a%0a%0a%0apei"8on who makes the incision is generally balanced by an %0aartificial guide, in order that he may not accidentally inflict a %0awound in the wood beyond the bark. %0a%0aA juice distils from the wound, which is known to us %0aas opobalsamum ; it is of extraordinary sweetness/'' but only %0aexudes in tiny drops, which are then collected in wool, and %0adeposited in small horns. When taken from out of these, the %0asubstance is placed in new earthen vessels ; it bears a strong %0aresemblance to a thick oil, and is of a white colour when fresh. %0aIt soon, however, turns red, and as it hardens loses its trans- %0aparency. When Alexander the Great waged war in tho^^e %0al)arts, it was looked upon as a fair summer day's work to fill a %0aningle concha" with this liquid ; the entire produce of the %0alarger garden being six congii, and of the smaller one a single %0acongius; the price, too, at which it was sold was double ils %0aweight in silver. At the present day the produce of a single %0atree, even, is larger ; the incisions are made three times every %0asummer, after which the tree is pruned. %0a%0aThe cuttings, too, fonn an article of merchandize : the fifth %0ayear after the conquest of Judaja, these cuttings, with the %0asuckers, were sold for the price of eight hundred thousand %0asesterces. These cuttings are called xylobalsamum,'® and are %0aboiled down for mixing with unguents, and in the manufac- %0atories have been substituted for the juices of the shrub. The %0abark is also in great request for medicinal purposes, but it is %0athe tears that ai'c so particularly valuable ; the seed holding %0a%0a'* Tins is said, probably, in allusion to the smell, and not the tastt'. %0aFee remarks, that I'liny speaks with a considerable degree of exaggeration, %0alis its odour is very inferior to that of several balsams which contain ben- %0azoic acid. The balsam obtained by incision, as mentioned by I'liny, is not %0abrought to Europe, but only that obtained by the process of decoction ; %0awhich is known as " balm of Mecca," or of Judaea. It is difficult to believe, %0aaccording to Ffeo, that it was adulterated with the substances liere men- %0ationed by Pliny ; oil of roses having been always a very precious com- %0amodity, wax being likely to change its nature entirely, and gums not being %0aof a nature to combine with it. Its asserted effects upon milk he states to %0abe entirely fabulous ; the statement is derived from Dioscorides. %0a%0aThe concha, or "shell," was a Greek and Roman liquid measure, of %0awhich there were two sizes. The smaller was half a cyathus, .0412 of an %0aEnglish pint ; the larger was about three times the size of the fonner, and %0awas known also as the oxybaphum. %0a%0aOr " wood of balsam."

Of the wood, that kind %0awhich resembles boxwood is considered the best : it has also %0athe strongest smell. The best seed is that which is the largest %0ain size and the heaviest in weight ; it has a biting or rather %0aburning taste in the mouth, Balsamum is adulterated with %0ahypericon'** from Petra, but the fraud is easily detected, from %0athe fact that the grains of the latter are larger, comparatively %0aempty, and longer than those of balsamum ; they are destitute %0aalso of any pungency of smell, and have a flavour like that %0aof pepper. %0a%0aAs to the tears of balsamum, the test of their goodness is %0atheir being unctuous to the touch, small, of a somewhat reddish %0acolour, and odoriferous when subjected to friction. That of %0asecond-rate quality is white ; the green and coarse is inferior, %0aand the black is the worst of all ; for, like olive-oil, it is apt %0ato turn rancid when old. Of all the incisions, the produce is %0aconsidered the best of those from which the liquid has flowed %0abefore the formation of the seed. In addition to what has %0abeen already stated, it is often adulterated with the juice of %0athe seed, and it is with considerable difficulty that the fraud is %0adetected by a slight bitterness in the taste, which ought to be %0adelicate and without the slightest mixture of acidity, the only %0apungency being that of the smell. It is adulterated also with %0aoil of roses, of Cyprus, of mastich, of balanus, of turpentine, %0aand of myrtle, as also with resin, galbanum, and Cyprian wax, %0ajust as occasion may serve; But the very worst adulteration %0aof all, is that which is eff'ected with gum, a substance which %0ais dry when emptied into the hand, and falls to the bottom %0aAvhen placed in water ; both of which are characteristics of the %0agenuine commodity. Balsamum, in a genuine state, should bo %0a(^uite hard, but when it is mixed with gum a brittle peUicle %0aforms upon it. The fraud can also be detected by the taste, %0aand when placed upon hot coals it may easily be seen if there %0ahas been any adulteration with wax and resin ; the flame too, in %0athis case, burns with a blacker smoke than when the balsamum %0ais pure. When mixed with honey its qualities are imme- %0adiately changed, for it will attract flies even in the hand. In %0aaddition to these various tests, a drop of pure balsamum, if %0aplaced in hike-warm water will settle to the bottom of the %0a's* See B. xxvi. cc. 53, 54.

But the %0abest test of all is, that it w^ill cause milk to curdle, and leave %0ano stain upon cloth. In no commodity are there practised %0amore pidpable frauds than in this, for a sextarius of balsamum %0awhich is sold by the fiscal authorities at three hundred denarii, %0ais sold again for a thousand, so vast is the profit to be derived %0afrom increasing this liquid by sophistication. The price of %0axylobalsamum is six denarii per pound. %0a%0aCHAP. 55. — STOEAX. %0a%0aThat part of S}Tia joining up to Judaea, and lyiug above %0aPhoenicia, produces storax, which is found in the vicinity of %0aGabala and Marathus," as also of Casius, a mountain of Se- %0aleucia. The tree*" bears the same name, and has a strong %0aresemblance to, the quince. The tear has a harsh taste, with a %0apleasant smell ; in the interior it has all the appearance of a reed, %0aand is filled with a liquid juice. About the rising of the Dog- %0astar, certain small winged worms hover about this substance %0aand eat it away, for which reason it is often found in a rotten %0astate, with worm-holes full of dust. The storax next in esti- %0amation after that already mentioned, comes from Pisidia, %0aSidon, Cyprus, and Cilicia ; that of Crete being considered the %0avery worst of all. That which comes from Mount Amanus, %0ain Syria, is highly esteemed for medicinal purposes, and even %0amore so by the perfumers. From whatever country it comes, %0athat which is of a red colour is preferred, and it should be %0aboth unctuous as well as viscous to the touch ; the worst kind %0ais that which crumbles like bran, and is covered all over with %0aa whitish mould. This substance is adulterated with the resin %0aof cedar or with gum, and sometimes with honey or bitter al- %0a%0aThese localities are mentioned in B. v. %0a%0aThe Storax oflBcinalis of Linnaeus, a tree found in the south of %0aEurope and the Levant. The variety found in France, and known as the %0aAlibouficr, produces no storax, or at least a very small proportion. The %0astorax of commerce appears in three states — grain storax, with which Pliny %0adoes not appear to have been acquainted ; amygdalite, which is perhaps %0attie sort which he speaks of as adulterated with bitter almonds; and lump %0astorax, of reddish brown colour, which is frequently mixed with wood dust, %0aor worm dust, as mentioned by Pliny, and is but little esteemed.

The price of storax of the best quality is seventeen %0adenarii per pound. It comes also from Pamphylia, but this %0alast is more arid, and not so full of juice. %0a%0aCHAP. 56. — GALBANtTM. %0a%0aS3Tia produces galbanum too, which grows upon the same %0amountain of Araanus : it exudes from a kind of giant- fennel" %0aof the same name as the resin, though sometimes it is known %0aas stagonitis. The kind that is the most esteemed is cartila- %0aginous, clear like hammoniacum, and free from all ligneous %0asubstances. Still, however, it is sometimes adulterated with %0abeans, or with sacopenium. If ignited in a pure state, it %0alias the property of driving away serpents®^ by its smoke. It %0ais sold at five denarii per pound, and is only employed for %0amedicinal purposes. %0a%0aCHAP. 57. (26.) PANAX. %0a%0aSyria, too, furnishes panax,** an ingredient used in unguents. %0aThis plant grows also at Psophis in Arcadia, about the sources %0aof the Erymanthus, in Africa also, and in Macedonia. This is %0aa peculiar kind of giant-fennel, which stands five cubits in %0aheight : it first throws out four leaves, and then six, which lie %0aclose to the ground, round, and of very considerable size ; those, %0ahowever, which grow towards the top resemble the leaves of %0athe olive. It bears its seed in certain tufts, which hang down, %0ajust as in the fennel. The juice is obtained by incisions %0a%0aA shrub of the family of Ombelliferoe, belonging to the genus bubon. %0aIt is a native of Asia Minor and Syria. %0a8- See B. xix. c. 52, and B. xx. c. 75. %0a%0a83 This was a common notion with the Romans. Virgil, Georg. B. iii. %0a1. 415, says : — %0a%0a"Galbaneoque agitare graves nidore chelydros." %0aThough considered to produce a pleasant perfume by the ancients, it is nn %0alonger held in estimation for that quality, and is only employed in some %0aslight degree for medical purposes. %0a%0a^ The produce of the Pastinaca opopanax of Linnaeus, or the Panax %0aCopticum of Bauhin, an umbelliferous plant which aboumls in the Ea»t, %0aand is not uncommon in the south of France.

The next in value is that of a pallid colour, while %0athe black is held in no esteem. The price of that of the best %0aquality is two denarii per pound. %0a%0aCHAP. 58. — spondtlium:. %0a%0aThe difference between this kind of giant-fennel and that %0aknown as spondylium,^ consists only in the leaf, which is %0asmaller, and divided like that of the plane tree. It grows in %0ashady places only. The seed bears the same name as the plant, %0aand has a strong resemblance to that of hart- wort : it is only %0aemployed in medicine. %0a%0aCUAP. 59. MALOBATHRtTM:. %0a%0aSyria produces the malobathrum^ also, a tree which bears a %0afolded leaf, with just the colour of a leaf when dried. From %0athis plant an oil is extracted for unguents. Egypt produces it %0ain still greater abundance ; but that which is the most esteemed %0aof all comes from India, where it is said to grow in the marshes %0alike the lentil. It has a more powerful odour than saffron, %0aand has a black, rough appearance, with a sort of brackish %0ataste. The white is the least approved of all, and it very soon %0aturns musty when old. In taste it ought to be similar to %0anard, when placed under the tongue. When made luke-warm %0ain wine, the odour which it emits is superior to any other. %0aThe prices at which this drug ranges are something quite %0amarvellous^ being from one denarius to four hundred per pound ; %0aas for the leaf, it generally sells at sixty denarii per pound. %0a%0aCHAP. 60. (27.) OMPHACrUM. %0a%0aOmphacium®'' is also a kind of oil, which is obtained from %0a%0aThe umbelliferous plant known as the Heracleura spondylium of Lin- %0anaeus. It is commonly found in France, where it is called Berce-branc- %0aursine. It received its name from the resemblance of its smell to that of %0athe sphondyle, a fetid kind of wood-beetle. %0a%0aSome suppose this tree to be the Laurus cassia of Linnaeus, or wild %0acinnamon; others take it for the betel, the Piper betel of Linnasus. Clu- %0asius thinks that the name is derived from the Indian Tamalpatra, the name %0agiven from time immemorial to the leaf of a tree known by the Arabs as %0atlie Cadcgi-indi, possibly the same as the Katou-carua of the Malabars. %0a%0aFrom the Greek o/x^d/ctov, being made of unripe grapes.

That is of an inferior quality which %0ais made from the druppa — such being the name that is given %0ato the olive before it is ripe and fit for food, but already %0abeginning to change its colour. The difference between them %0ais, that the latter kind is green, the former white. The om- %0aphacium that is made from the vine is extracted from either %0athe psythian^ or the Amiuean grape, when the grapes are %0aabout the size of a chick-pea, just before the rising of the Dog. %0astar. The grape is gathered when the first bloom is appearing %0aupon it, and the verjuice is extracted, after which the residue"* %0ais left to dry in the sun, due precautions being taken against %0athe dews of the night. The verjuice, after being collected, is %0aput into earthen vessels, and then, after that, stored in jars %0aof Cyprian copper.^" The best kind is that Avhich is of a %0areddish colour, acrid, and dry to the taste. The price at %0awhich it sells is six denarii per pound. Omphacium is also %0amade another way — the unripe grape is pounded in a mortar, %0aafter which it is dried in the sun, and then divided into %0alozenges. %0a%0aCHAP. 61. (28.) — BEYON, OENANTHE, AND MASSARIS. %0a%0aBryon'^ also bears an affinity to these substances, being the %0aclusters of berries produced by the white poplar. The best %0akinds grow in the vicinity of Cnidos, or in Caria, in spots that %0aare destitute of water, or else in dry and rugged localities. A %0a%0aremarks, that made from the olive is correctly described as a kind of oil, %0abut that made from the grape must have been a rob, or pure verjuice. %0aThese two liquids must have had totally different qualities, and resembled %0aeach other in nothing but the name. That extracted from the olive is %0amentioned again in B. xxiii. c. 4, in reference to its medicinal properties. %0aThese grapes are described in B. xiv. c. 4 and c. 11. %0a%0a-9 " Reliquum corpus." It is not clear what is the meaning of this. %0aThe passage is either in a corrupt state, or defective. %0a%0a9" A singular metal, one would think, for keeping verjuice in. %0a%0a" From the Greek /Spi/ov, " moss." He speaks again of these grapes %0aof the white poplar in B. xxiv. c. 34 ; also in c. 51 of the present Book. %0aIlardouin thinks that he is speaking of moss. Fee is of opinion, that the %0ablossoms or buds of the tree are meant, which have a fragrant smell. This %0ais the more probable, as we find Pliny here speaking of the oonanthe, or vine- %0aflower, by which Fee supposes that he means the blossom of the Vitis %0avinifera of Linnaeus, which exhales a delightful perfume. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 63.] %0a%0a%0a%0aCINNAMON OR COMA CUM. %0a%0a%0a%0a155 %0a%0a%0a%0abryon of second-rate quality is produced from the cedar of %0aLycia.'* Qilnanthe, too, bears an affinity to these substances, %0abeing the clusters of the wild vine : it is gathered when it is %0ain flower, or, in other words, when it has the finest smell : %0aafter which it is dried in the shade upon a linen sheet spread %0abeneath it, and then stored away in casks. The best sort is %0athat which comes from Parapotamia ; ^ the next best kinds are %0athose made at Antiochia and Laodicea in Syria ; and that of %0athird-rate quality, comes from the mountainous parts of Media ; %0athis last, however, is preferable for medicinal purposes. Some %0apersons give the preference over all to that grown in the %0aisland of Cyprus. As to that which comes from Africa, it %0ais solely used for medicinal purposes, being known by the %0aname of massaris.^* Wliatever country it may happen to be, %0athe white wild vine produces an oenanthe of superior quality %0ato the black. %0a%0aCHAP. 62. — ELATE OB SPATHE. %0a%0aThere is another tree"* also, that contributes to the manu- %0afacture of unguents, by some persons known under the name %0aof elate, but which we call abies ; others again call it a palm, %0aand others give it the name of spathe. That of Hammonium %0ais the most esteemed, and that of Egypt next, after which %0acomes the Syrian tree. It is only odoriferous, however, in %0aplaces that are destitute of water. The tears of it are of an %0aunctuous nature, and are employed as an ingredient in un- %0aguents, to modify the harshness of the oil. %0a%0aCHAP. 63. — CINNAMON OR COMACUM. %0a%0aIn Syria, too, is produced that kind of cinnamon which is also %0aknown as comacum."^ This is a juice which is extracted from %0a%0aThe bud, probably, of the Juniperus Lycia. %0a93 See B. vi. c. 31. %0a%0aSaid to have been a surname given by some nations to the god Bac- %0achus. %0a%0a95 It is generally supposed by the commentators, that Pliny makes a %0amistake here, and that the elate or spathe was not a tree, but the envelope %0aor capsule, containing the flowers and fruit of a tree, which is supposed by %0asome to have been really the Pha3nix dactylifera, or date-palm. There %0acan be little doubt that he is mistaken in his mention of the abies or fir- %0atree here. See B. xxiii. c. 53. %0a%0a"6 Bauhin thinks that this juice or oil was extracted from the nutmeg, %0a%0a%0a%0a156 %0a%0a%0a%0aflint's natceal history. %0a%0a%0a%0a[Book XII. %0a%0a%0a%0aa nut, and very different from the extract of the real cinna- %0amomum, though it somewhat resembles it in its agreeable smell. %0aThe price at whicli it sells is forty asses per pound. %0a%0aSuJiMAKT. — Remarkable facts, narratives, and observations, %0anine hundred and seventy-four. %0a%0aRoman authors quoted. — M.

It now remains for us to speak of %0a%3c the vegetable productions of the earth, which are equally far %0a%3c from being destitute of a vital spirit,' (for, indeed, nothing can %0a%3c live without it), that we may then proceed to describe the mine- %0a%3c rals extracted from it, and so none of the works of Nature may %0a%3c be passed by in silence. Long, indeed, were these last boun- %0a%3c ties of hers concealed beneath the ground, the trees and forests %0a%3c being regarded as the most valuable benefits conferred by Na- %0a%3c ture upon mankind. It was from the forest that man drew %0a%3c his first aliment, by the leaves of the trees was his cave ren- %0a%3c dered more habitable, and by their bark was his clothing sup- %0a%3c plied ; even at this very day," there are nations that live %0a%3c under similar circumstances to these. Still more and more, %0a%3c then, must we be struck with wonder and admiration, that %0a%3c from a primaival state such as this, we should now be cleaving %0a%3c the mountains for their marbles, visiting the Seres ^ to obtain %0a%3c our clothing, seeking the pearl in the depths of the Eed Sea, %0a%3c and the emerald in the very bowels of the earth. For our %0a%3c adornment with those precious stones it is that we have devised %0a%3c those wounds which we make in our ears ; because, forsooth, %0a%3c it was deemed not enough to carry them on our hands, our %0a%3c necks, and our hair, if we did not insert them in our very flesh %0a%3c as well.

Each kind of tree remains immutably conse- %0a%3c crated to its own peculiar divinity, the beech* to Jupiter,* the %0a%3c laurel to Apollo, the olive to Minerva, the myrtle to Venus, %0a%3c and the poplar to Hercules : besides which, it is our behef %0a%3c that the Sylvans, the Fauns, and various kinds of goddess %0a%3c Nymphs, have the tutelage of the woods, and we look upon %0a%3c those deities as especially appointed to preside over them by %0a%3c the will of heaven. In more recent times, it was the trees %0a%3c that by their juices, more soothing even than corn, first molli- %0a%3c fied the natural asperity of man ; and it is from these that we %0a%3c now derive the oil of the olive that renders the limbs so supple, %0a%3c the draught of wine that so efficiently recruits the strength, %0a%3c and the numerous delicacies which spring up spontaneously at %0a%3c the various seasons of the year, and load our tables with their %0a%3c \'iands — tables to replenish which, we engage in combat with %0a%3c wild beasts, and seek for the fishes which have fattened upon %0a%3c the dead corpse of the shipwrecked mariner — indeed, it is only %0a%3c at the second ' coxirse, after aU, that the produce of the trees %0a%3c appears. %0a%3c %0a%3c But, in addition to this, the trees have a thousand other %0a%3c uses, all of which are indispensable to the full enjoyment of %0a%3c %0a%3c * Desfontaines remarks, that we may still trace vestiges of this custom %0a%3c in the fine trees that grow near church porches, and in church-yards. %0a%3c Of course, his remark will apply to France more particularly. %0a%3c %0a%3c 5 It is doubtful whether the aesculus of the Romans was the same as the %0a%3c bay-oak, the holm-oak, or the beech. See B. xvi. c. 4. %0a%3c %0a%3c « See further on this subject in Phaedrus's Fables, B. iii, f. 17. %0a%3c %0a%3c ' Reckoning the promulsis, antecsena, or gustatio, not as a course, but %0a%3c only a prelude, the bellaria, or dessert, at the Roman banquets, formed the %0a%3c second course, or mensa. It consisted of fruits uncooked, sweetmeflts, and %0a%3c pastry. * %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 3.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c EXOTIC TEEE8. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 103 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c life. It is by the aid of the tree that we plough the deep, and %0a%3c bring near to us far distant lands ; it is by the aid of the tree, %0a%3c too, that we construct our edifices. The statues, even, of the %0a%3c deities were formed of the wood of trees, in the days when no %0a%3c Talue had been set as yet on the dead carcase^ of a wild beast, %0a%3c and when, luxury not yet deriving its sanction from the %0a%3c gods themselves, we had not to behold, resplendent with the %0a%3c same ivory, the heads of the divinities* and the feet of our %0a%3c tables. It is related that the Gauls, separated from us as they %0a%3c were by the Alps, which then formed an almost insurmountable %0a%3c bulwark, had, as their chief motive for invading Italy, its %0a%3c dried figs, its grapes, its oil, and its wine, samples^** of which %0a%3c had been brought back to them by Helico, a citizen of the %0a%3c Helvetii, who had been staying at Rome, to practise there as %0a%3c an artizan. We may offer some excuse, then, for them, when %0a%3c we know that they came in quest of these various productions, %0a%3c though at the price even of war. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 3. — EXOTIC TREES. WHEN THE PLANE-TREE FIRST %0a%3c APPEARED IN ITALY, AND W^HENCE IT CAME. %0a%3c %0a%3c But who is there that will not, with good reason, be sur- %0a%3c prised to learn that a tree has been introduced among us from %0a%3c a foreign clime for nothing but its shade ? I mean the plane,^^ %0a%3c which was first brought across the Ionian Sea to the Isle'^ of %0a%3c Diomcdes, there to be planted at his tomb, and was afterwards %0a%3c imported thence into Sicily, being one of the very first exotic %0a%3c trees that were introduced into Italy. At the present day, %0a%3c however, it has penetrated as far as the country of the %0a%3c Morini, and occupies even a tributary^^ soil ; in return for which %0a%3c %0a%3c s He alludes to the pursuit of the elephant, for the purpose of obtaining %0a%3c ivory, which was extensively used in his day, in making the statues of the %0a%3c divinities. %0a%3c %0a%3c 9 A sarcastic antithesis. And yet Dalechamps would read "hominum" %0a%3c instead of " numinum" ! %0a%3c %0a%3c 10 Praemissa. The exact meaning of this word does not appear. Though %0a%3c all the M8S. agree in it, it is probably a corrupt reading. Plutarch, in %0a%3c his Life of Camillus, says that the wine of Italy was first introduced in %0a%3c Uaul by Aruns, the Etruscan. %0a%3c %0a%3c " The Platanus orientalis of Linnaeus.

These trees did not, however, %0a%3c in that locality, attain any very great height. I find it also %0a%3c stated by some authors, that there were some other instances, %0a%3c in those days even, of plane-trees being found in Italy, and I %0a%3c find some mentioned by name as existing in Spain. ^* %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 4. THE NATUEE OF THE PLANE-TKEE. %0a%3c %0a%3c This circumstance took place about the time of the capture %0a%3c of the City of Eome ; and to such high honour, in the course %0a%3c of time, did the plane-tree attain, that it was nurtured by %0a%3c pouring wine upon it, it being found that the roots were greatly %0a%3c strengthened by doing so. Thus have we taught the very %0a%3c trees, even, to be wine-bibbers ! %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 5. — REMARKABLE FACTS CONNECTED WITH THE %0a%3c PLANE-TREE, %0a%3c %0a%3c The first plane-trees that were spoken of in terms of high %0a%3c admiration were those which adorned the walks of the Aca- %0a%3c demy'^ at Athens — [in one of which], the roots extended a dis- %0a%3c tance of thirty-three cubits, and spread far beyond its branches. %0a%3c At the present day, there is a very famous plane in Lycia, %0a%3c situate in close proximity to a fountain of the most refresh- %0a%3c ing coolness ; standing near the road, with the cavity in its %0a%3c %0a%3c rent which the tributary nations paid to the Roman treasury. Virgil and %0a%3c Homer speak of the shade of the plane-tree, as a pleasant resort for festive %0a%3c parties. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is not improbable that Pliny, in copying from Theophrastus, has %0a%3c here committed an error. That author, B. ix. c. 7, says : iv fiiv ydp Tf %0a%3c 'ASpia rrXdravov ov ^aaiv slvat, ttXtiv ntpl to AiofirjSovQ Upov %3cnraviav %0a%3c Sk Kai iv 'IrnXlg, Trdo-y. " They say that in Adria there are no plane- %0a%3c trees, except about the temple of Diomedes : and that they are extremely %0a%3c rare in Italy." Pliny, probably, when his secretary was reading to him, %0a%3c mistook the word airaviav, "rare," for 'lo-Trart^, "in Spain." %0a%3c %0a%3c '5 It has been remarked that, in reality, this process would only tend %0a%3c to impede its growth. Macrobius tells us, that Hortensius was guilty of %0a%3c this singular folly. %0a%3c %0a%3c i« Situate near the sea-shore. It was here that Plato taught.

In addition to this, that nothing may be wanting to %0a%3c its exact resemblance to a grotto, there is a circle of seats %0a%3c within, formed of stone, intermingled with pumice overgrown %0a%3c with moss. This tree was looked upon as so worthy of remark, %0a%3c that Licinius Mucianus, who was three times consul, and re- %0a%3c cently the legatus of that province, thought it a circumstance %0a%3c deservicg of transmission even to posterity, that he, together %0a%3c with eighteen persons of his retinue, had sat down to a banquet %0a%3c in the interior of it. Its leaves afforded material for their %0a%3c couches in the greatest abundance, while he himself, sheltered %0a%3c from every gust of wind, and trying in vain to hear the pat- %0a%3c tering of the rain on the leaves, took his meal there, and en- %0a%3c joyed himself more than he woidd have done amid the resplen- %0a%3c dence of marble, a multiplicity of paintings, and beneath a %0a%3c cieling refulgent with gold. %0a%3c %0a%3c Another curious instance, again, was that afforded in the %0a%3c reign of the Emperor Caius.''' That prince was so struck with %0a%3c admiration on seeing a plane in the territory of Veliternum, %0a%3c which presented floor after floor, like those of the several stories %0a%3c of a house, by means of broad benches loosely laid from branch %0a%3c to branch, that he held a banquet in it — himself adding^^ very %0a%3c materially to the shade it threw — the triclinium being formed %0a%3c for the reception of fifteen guests and the necessary attendants : %0a%3c to this singular dining-room he gave the name of his "nest." %0a%3c %0a%3c At Gortyna, in the Isle of Crete, there is, in the vicinity of %0a%3c a fountain there, a single plane-tree, which has been long cele- %0a%3c brated in the records of both the Greek and the Latin language : %0a%3c it never loses its leaves, and from an early period one of the %0a%3c fabulous legends of Greece has been attached to it, to the effect %0a%3c that it was beneath this tree that Jupiter lay with Europa ; %0a%3c just as if there had not been another tree of a similar nature %0a%3c %0a%3c " Caligula. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is supposed that he here alludes sarcastically to the extreme cor- %0a%3c pulence of Caligula. %0a%3c %0a%3c M. Fee, the learned editor of the botanical books in Ajasson's trans- %0a%3c lation, remarks, that this cannot have been the Platanus of the botanists, %0a%3c and that there is no tree of Europe, which does not lose its leaves, that at %0a%3c all resembles it. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 106 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c PLimr's NATIJBAL HISTOET. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XII. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c in the island of Cyprus.

In later times, during the reign of the Emperor %0a%3c Claudius, a Thessalian eunuch, the freedman of MarcelluB %0a%3c ^serninus,^' who, however, from motives of ambition had en- %0a%3c rolled himself in the number of the freedmen of the emperor, %0a%3c and had acquired very considerable wealth, introduced this %0a%3c plane into Italy, in order to beautify his country-seat : so that %0a%3c he may not inappropriately be styled a second Dionysius. %0a%3c These monstrosities of other lands are still to be seen in Italy, %0a%3c independently of those which that country has herself devised. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 6. (2.) — THE CHAir^PLATANTTS. WHO WAS THE FIBST %0a%3c TO CLIP GREEN SHEUB8. %0a%3c %0a%3c For we find in Italy some plane-trees, which are kno-wn as %0a%3c chamseplatani,^^ in consequence of their stunted growth ; for %0a%3c we have discovered the art of causing abortion in trees even, %0a%3c and hence, even in the vegetable world we shall have occasion %0a%3c to make mention of dwarfs, an unprepossessing subject in every %0a%3c case. This result is obtained in trees, by a peculiar method %0a%3c adopted in planting and lopping them. C. Matius,'" a member %0a%3c of the Equestrian order, and a friend of the late Emperor %0a%3c Augustus, invented the art of clipping arbours, within the last %0a%3c eighty years. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 7.

For the present, I shall only make mention of the %0a%3c really exotic trees, beginning with the one that is applied to %0a%3c the most salutary uses. The citron tree, called the Assyrian, %0a%3c and by some the Median apple, is an antidote against poisons.*^ %0a%3c The leaf is similar to that of the arbute, except that it has %0a%3c small prickles-^ running across it. As to the fruit, it is never %0a%3c eaten,''* but it is remarkable for its extremely powerful smell, %0a%3c Avhich is the case, also, with the leaves ; indeed, the odour is %0a%3c so strong, that it will penetrate clothes, when they are once %0a%3c impregnated with it, and hence it is very useful in repelling %0a%3c the attacks of noxious insects. The tree bears fruit at all %0a%3c seasons of the year ; while some is falling off, other fruit is %0a%3c ripening, and other, again, just bursting into birth. Various %0a%3c nations have attempted to naturalize this tree among them, for %0a%3c the sake of its medical properties, by planting it in pots of %0a%3c clay, with holes drilled in them, for the purpose of introducing %0a%3c .the air to the roots; and I would here remark, once for all, %0a%3c that it is as well to remember that the best plan is to pack all %0a%3c slips of trees that have to be carried to any distance, as close %0a%3c together as they can possibly be placed. It has been found, %0a%3c however, that this tree will grow nowhere*'' except in %0a%3c Media or Persia, It is this fruit, the pips of which, as we %0a%3c tave already mentioned,-^ the Parthian grandees employ in %0a%3c ■seasoning their ragouts, as being peculiarly conducive to the %0a%3c 'sweetening of the breath. We find no other tree very highly %0a%3c commended that is produced in Media. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 8.

Yirgil has spokcu m %0a%3c glowing terms of the ebony-tree, one of those which are pecu- %0a%3c liar to India, and he further informs us, that it will grow in %0a%3c no other country. Herodotus, however, has preferred to %0a%3c ascribe ^- it to ^Ethiopia ; and states that the people of that %0a%3c country were in the habit of paying to the kings of Persia, %0a%3c every third year, by way of tribute,^-' one hundred billets of %0a%3c ebony-wood, together with a certain quantity of gold and %0a%3c ivory. Nor ought we here to omit the fact, inasmuch as the %0a%3c same author has stated to that effect, that the iEthiopianj %0a%3c were also in the habit of paying, by way of tribute, twenty %0a%3c large elephants' teeth. So high was tlae esteem in which %0a%3c ivory was held in the year from the building of our city, %0a%3c 310: for it was at that period that this author was com- %0a%3c piling his History at Thurii, in Italy ; which is all the more %0a%3c remarkable, from the implicit confidence we place in him, %0a%3c when he says^* that up to that time, no native of Asia or %0a%3c Greece, to his knowledge at least, had ever beheld the river %0a%3c Padus. The plan of ^Ethiopia, which, as we have already %0a%3c mentioned,^" was recently laid before the Emperor Nero, in- %0a%3c forms us, that this tree is very uncommon in the country that %0a%3c lies between Syene, the extreme boundary of the empu-e, and %0a%3c Meroe, a distance of eight hundred and ninetj^-six miles ; and %0a%3c that, in fact, the only kind of tree that is to be found there, is %0a%3c the palm. It was, probably, for this reason, that ebony held %0a%3c the third place in the tribute that was thus imposed. %0a%3c %0a%3c 29 See B. vi. c. 20. %0a%3c %0a%3c 30 See B. vii. c. 2.

There is little doubt that, under the general name of %0a%3c " ebony," the wood of many kinds of trees was, and is still, imported into %0a%3c the western world, so that both Herodotus and Virgil may have been cor- %0a%3c rect in representing ebony as the product of both India and Ethiopia. %0a%3c %0a%3c 33* Herodotus says ttix> hundred. %0a%3c %0a%3c 33 In Italy, whither he had retired from the hostile attacks of his fellow- %0a%3c citizens.

There are two kinds of ebony ; the rarest kind %0a%3c is the best, and is produced from a tree that is singularly free %0a%3c from knots. The wood is black and shining, and pleasing to %0a%3c the eye, without any adventitious aid from art.

THE INDIAN FIG. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Indian fig bears but a small fruit. Always growing %0a%3c spontaneously, it spreads far and wide with its vast branches, %0a%3c the ends of which bend downwards into the ground to such a %0a%3c degree, that they take fresh root in the course of a year, and %0a%3c thus form a new plantation around the parent stock, traced in %0a%3c a circular form, just as though it had been the work of the %0a%3c ornamental gardener. Within the bowers thus formed, the %0a%3c shepherds take up their abode in the summer, the space occu- %0a%3c pied by them being, at once, overshadowed and protected by %0a%3c %0a%3c Fee remarks, that the words of Pliny dc not afford us any means of %0a%3c judi^ing precisely what tree it was that he understood by the name of ebony. %0a%3c He borrows his account mainly from Theophrastus. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is not known to what tree he alludes. %0a%3c %0a%3c This account of the Ficus Indica, or religiosa, known to us as the %0a%3c banian-tree, is borrowed entirely from Theophrastus. Fee remarks, how- %0a%3c ever, that he is wrong in some of his statements, for that the leaves are not %0a%3c cvesceTit-shaped, but oblong and pointed, and that the fruit has not a plea- %0a%3c sant flavour, and is only eaten by tlie birds. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 110 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c pliny's natural history. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XII, %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c the bulwark which the tree thus throws around ; a most %0a%3c graceful sight, whether we stand beneath and look upwards, %0a%3c or whether we view its arcaded foliage from a distance.

The broad leaves of the tree have just the %0a%3c shape of an Amazonian buckler; and hence it is that the %0a%3c fruit, from being quite covered by the leaves, is greatly impeded %0a%3c in its growth.

The leaf of this tree %0a%3c resembles, in shape, the wing of a bird, being three cubits in %0a%3c length, and two in breadth. It puts forth its fruit from the %0a%3c bark, a fruit remarkable for the sweetness of its juice, a single %0a%3c one containing sufficient to satisfy four persons. The name of %0a%3c this tree is "pala," and of the fruit, " ariena."

The grains, he says, grow in clusters, and not %0a%3c in a husk or po^ and he remarks, that the long pepper and the black pep- %0a%3c per, of which the white is only a variety divested of the outer coat, are %0a%3c distinct species. He also observes, that the real long pepper, the Piper %0a%3c longuni ot Linnaeus, was not known to the ancients. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 112 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c PLINY 3 NATUllAL UISTOET. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XII. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c although, iudccd, it has been alleged by some authors that they %0a%3c onlj- grow on the slopes of Caucasus which lie exposed to the %0a%3c Bun. The seeds, however, differ from those of the juniper, in %0a%3c being enclosed in small pods similar to those whicli we see in %0a%3c the kidney-bean. These pods are picked before they open, %0a%3c and when dried in the sun, make what we call " long pepper." %0a%3c But if allowed to ripen, they will open gradually, and when %0a%3c arrived at maturity, discover the white pepper ; if left ex- %0a%3c posed to the heat of the sun, this becomes Avrinkled, and changes %0a%3c its colour. Even these productions, however, are subject to %0a%3c their own peculiar infirmities, and are apt to become blasted %0a%3c by the inclemency of the weather ; in which case the seeds %0a%3c are found to be rotten, and mere husks. These abortive seeds are %0a%3c known by the name of " bregma," a word which in the Indian %0a%3c language signifies " dead." Of all the various kinds of pepper, %0a%3c this is the most pungent, as well as the very lightest, and is %0a%3c remarkable for the extreme paleness of its colour. That which %0a%3c is black is of a more agreeable flavour ; but the white pepper %0a%3c is of a milder quality than either. %0a%3c %0a%3c The. root of this tree is not, as many persons have imagined, %0a%3c the same as the substance known as zimpiberi, or, as some call %0a%3c it, zingiberi, or ginger, although it is very like it in taste. %0a%3c Eor ginger, in fact, grows in Arabia and in Troglodytica, in %0a%3c various cultivated spots, being a small plant*" with a white %0a%3c root. This plant is apt to decay very speedily, although it is %0a%3c of intense pungency ; the price at which it sells is six denarii %0a%3c per pound. Long pepper is very easily adulterated with %0a%3c Alexandi-ian mustard ; its price is fifteen denarii per pound, %0a%3c while that of white pepper is seven, and of black, four. It is %0a%3c quite surprising that the use of pepper has come so much into %0a%3c fashion, seeing that in other substances which we use, it is %0a%3c sometimes their sweetness, and sometimes their appearance that %0a%3c has attracted our notice; whereas, pepper has nothing in it %0a%3c that can plead as a recommendation to either fruit or berry, its %0a%3c only desirable quality being a certain pungency ; and yet it is %0a%3c for this that we import it all the way from India! AVho was %0a%3c the first to make trial of it as an article of food ? and who, I %0a%3c wonder, was the man that was not content to pfepare himself %0a%3c %0a%3c so Fee remarks, that this is not a correct description of ginger, the Amo- %0a%3c mum zingiber of Linnaeus. Dioscorides was one of those who thought %0a%3c that ginger was the root of the pepper- tree. ° %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 1.5.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c CABTOPHTLLOIT. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 113 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c by hunger only for the satisfying of a greedy appetite ?

Italy/^ too, now possesses a species of %0a%3c pepper-tree, somewhat larger than the myrtle, and not very %0a%3c unlike it. The bitterness of the grains is similar to that which %0a%3c we may reasonably suppose to exist in the Indian pepper %0a%3c when newly gathered ; but it is wanting in that mature fla- %0a%3c vour which the Indian grain acquires by exposure in the sim, %0a%3c and, consequently, bears no resemblance to it, either in colour %0a%3c or the wrinkled appearance of the seeds. Pepper is adulterated %0a%3c with juniper berries, which have the property, to a marvellous %0a%3c degree, of assuming the pungency of pepper. In reference to %0a%3c its weight, there are also several methods of adulterating it. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 15.

The tree is a native of both India and %0a%3c Arabia, as well as Media and Babylon ; some persons give to %0a%3c the bdellium that is imported by way of Media, the name of %0a%3c peraticum.^' This last is remarkable for its brittleness, while, %0a%3c at the same time, it is harder and more bitter than the other %0a%3c kinds ; that of India, on the other hand, is raoister, and gummy. %0a%3c This last sort is adulterated by means of almonds, while the %0a%3c various other kinds are falsified with the bark of scordastura, %0a%3c that being the name of a tree*® the gum of which strongly re- %0a%3c sembles bdellium. These adulterations, however, are to he %0a%3c detected — and let it suffice to mention it here, in relation to all %0a%3c other perfumes as well — by the smell, the colour, the weight, %0a%3c the taste, and the action of fire. The bdellium of Bactriana %0a%3c is shining and dry, and covered with numerous white spots %0a%3c resembling the finger-nails ; besides which, it should be of a %0a%3c certain weight, heavier or lighter than which it ought not to %0a%3c be.

He adds, too, that certain trees of Arabia, %0a%3c from which vestments are made, are called cynae, and that they %0a%3c have a leaf similar to that of the palm. Thus do their very %0a%3c trees afford clothing for the people of India. In the islands of %0a%3c Tylos, there is also another tree, with a blossom like the white %0a%3c violet in appearance, though four times as large, but it is %0a%3c destitute of smell, a very remarkable fact in these climates. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 23.

This flower %0a%3c shuts" at night, and, beginning to open towards sun-rise, %0a%3c appears in full blow by mid-day ; the natives are in the habit %0a%3c of saying that in this way it goes to sleep. The same island %0a%3c bears also the palm, the olive, the vine, and the fig, with %0a%3c various other kinds of fruit.

THE TWELVE VARIETIES OF THE PLANT. %0a%3c %0a%3c Of the leaf, which is that of the nard," it is only right to %0a%3c ppeak somewhat more at length, as it holds the principal place %0a%3c among our unguents. The nard is a shrub with a heavy, %0a%3c thick root, but short, black, brittle, and yet unctuous as well ; %0a%3c %0a%3c According to most commentators, this is the Costus Arabicus of Lin- %0a%3c naius. Dioscoridcs mentions three varieties of costus : the Arabian, whic^ %0a%3c is of the best quality, and is white and odoriferous; the Indian, which is %0a%3c black and smooth ; and the Syrian, which is of the colour of wax, dusky, and %0a%3c Btrono' smelling. Fee, however, doubts whether the modern costus is the %0a%3c Siirae'thing as that of the ancients ; for, as he says, although it has a sweet %0a%3c odour, it does not deserve the appellation of a " precious aromatic," which %0a%3c we find constantly given to it by the ancients. %0a%3c '8 See B. vi. c. 23. %0a%3c %0a%3c ™ It is probable that the nard of the ancients, from which they extracted %0a%3c the famous nard-oil, was not the same plant whicli we know as the Indian %0a%3c nard, or Andropogon nardus of Linnaeus. Indeed, it has been pretty con. %0a%3c clusively established bv Sir William Jones, in his "Asiatic Researches," %0a%3c that the Valeriana Jatamansi is the plant from which they obtained the oil. %0a%3c Among the Hindoos, it is known as djatamansi, and by the Arabs under %0a%3c the name of sombul, or " spike," from the fact of the base being surrounded %0a%3c with ears or spikes, whence, probably, the Roman appellation. This spe- %0a%3c cies of valerian grows in the more distant and mountainous parts of Iudia,_ %0a%3c Bootan and Nepaul, for instance. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 120 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c flint's natukal history. [Book XII. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c it has a musty smell, too, very much like that of the cyperus, %0a%3c with a sharp, acrid taste, the leaves being small, and growing %0a%3c in tufts. The heads of the nard spread out into ears ; hence %0a%3c it is that nard is so famous for its two-fold production, the %0a%3c spike or ear, and the leaf. There is another kind, again, that %0a%3c grows on the banks of the Ganges, but is altogether con- %0a%3c demned, as being good for nothing; it bears the name of %0a%3c ozsenitis, ^ and emits a fetid odour. Nard is adulterated %0a%3c with a sort of plant called pseudo-nard,"' which is found %0a%3c growing everywhere, and is known by its thick, broad leaf, %0a%3c and its sickly colour, which inclines to white. It is so- %0a%3c phisticated, also, by being mixed with the root of the genuine %0a%3c nard, which adds very considerably to its weight. Gum is %0a%3c also used for the same purpose, antimony, and cyperus ; or, %0a%3c at least, the outer coat of the cyperus. Its genuineness is tested %0a%3c by its lightness, the redness of its colour, its sweet smell, and %0a%3c the taste more particularly, which parches the mouth, and %0a%3c leaves a pleasant flavour behind it ; the price of spikenard is %0a%3c one hundred denarii per pound. %0a%3c %0a%3c Leaf ^- nard varies in price according to the size ; for that %0a%3c which is known by the name of hadrosphaerum, consisting of %0a%3c the larger leaves, sells at forty denarii per pound ; when the %0a%3c leaves are smaller, it is called mesosphserum, and is sold at %0a%3c sixty. But that which is considered the most valuable of all, %0a%3c is known as microsphaerum, and consists of the very smallest %0a%3c of the leaves ; it sells at seventy-five denarii per pound. All %0a%3c these varieties of nard have an agreeable odour, but it is most %0a%3c powerful when fresh. If the nard is old when gathered, that %0a%3c which is of a black colour is considered the best. %0a%3c %0a%3c In our part of the world, the Syrian^ nard is held in the %0a%3c %0a%3c 80 From the Greek, o^aiva, " a putrid sore." Fee suggests that this %0a%3c may have been the Nardus hadrosphaerum of the moderns. %0a%3c %0a%3c 81 Fee supposes that this is not lavender, as some have thought, hut the %0a%3c Allium victorialis of modern naturalists, which is still mixed with the nard %0a%3c from the Andropogon. He doubts the possibility of its having been adul- %0a%3c terated with substances of such a different nature as those mentioned here %0a%3c by Pliny. %0a%3c %0a%3c 82 Fee is of opinion, that the Greek writers, from whom Pliny copied %0a%3c this passage, intended to speak of the ears of nard, or spikenard. %0a%3c %0a%3c 83 According to Dioscorides, this appellation only means such nard as ii %0a%3c cultivated in certain mountains of India which look toward Syria, and %0a%3c which, according to that author, was the best nard of all. Dalechamps and %0a%3c •liardouin, however, ridicule this explanation of the term. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 27.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ASAETJM, OB FOAL FOOT. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 121 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c next highest esteem next to this; then the Gallic;®* and in %0a%3c the third place, that of Crete, which by some persons is %0a%3c called "agrion," and by others "phu." This last has exactly the %0a%3c loaf of the olusatrum,** with a stalk a cubit in length, knotted, %0a%3c of a whitish colour, inclining to purple, and a root that runs %0a%3c sideways ; it is covered, too, with long hair, and strongly %0a%3c resembles the foot of a bird. Field nard is known by the %0a%3c name of baccar.*^ "We shall have further occasion to mention %0a%3c it when we come to speak of the flowers. All these kinds of %0a%3c nard, however, are to be reckoned as herbs, with the exception %0a%3c of Indian nard. Of these, the Gallic kind is pulled up along %0a%3c with the root, and washed in wine ; after which it is di'ied in %0a%3c the shade, and wrapped up in paper, in small parcels. It is %0a%3c not very different from the Indian nard, but is lighter than %0a%3c that of Syria ; the price at which it sells is three denarii per %0a%3c pound. The only way of testing the leaves of all these %0a%3c varieties of nard, is to see that they are not brittle and parched, %0a%3c instead of being dried naturally and gradually. Together %0a%3c with the nard that grows in Gaul, there always springs up %0a%3c a herb, which is known by the name of hirculus, or the %0a%3c "little goat," on account of its offensive smell, it being very %0a%3c similar to that of the goat. This herb, too, is very much used %0a%3c in the adulteration of nard, though it differs from it in the %0a%3c fact that it has no stem, and its leaves are smaller ; the root, %0a%3c too, is not bitter, and is entirely destitute of smell. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 27.

This plant, also, is plucked along with %0a%3c the root, and is carefully pressed together witli the hands ; for %0a%3c it very soon becomes brittle. That kind is held in the highest %0a%3c esteem, the leaves of which bear a strong resemblance to those %0a%3c of the pomegranate, being free from wrinkles, and of a red %0a%3c colour. The second quality is that which is of a pallid hue. %0a%3c That which has a green, grassy appearance, is not so good, %0a%3c and the white is the worst of aU ; it assumes this appearance %0a%3c when old. The price of clustered amomum is sixty denarii per %0a%3c pound, but in dust it sells at only fortj^-nine.

At a distance of eight stations %0a%3c . from this is the incense-bearing region, known by the name %0a%3c of Saba. The Greeks say that the word signifies a " secret %0a%3c mystery." This district looks towards the north-east, and %0a%3c is rendered inaccessible by rocks on every side, whUe it is %0a%3c bounded on the right by the sea, from which it is shut out by %0a%3c cliffs of tremendous height. The soil of this territory is said %0a%3c to be of a milky white, a little inclining to red. The forests %0a%3c extend twenty schceni in length, and half that distance in %0a%3c breadth. The length of the schoenus, according to the esti- %0a%3c mate of Eratosthenes, is forty stadia, or, in other words, five %0a%3c miles ; some persons, however, have estimated the schoenus at %0a%3c no more than thirty-two stadia. In this district some lofty %0a%3c hills take their rise, and the trees, which spring up sponta- %0a%3c neously, run downwards along the declivities to the plains. %0a%3c It is generallj^ agreed that the soil is argillaceous, and that %0a%3c the springs which there take their rise are but few in number, %0a%3c and of a nitrous quality. Adjoining are the Minaei, the people %0a%3c of another community, through whose country is the sole tran- %0a%3c sit for the frankincense, along a single narrow road. The %0a%3c %0a%3c 95 Virgil, Georg. B. ii. 1. 139, mentions Panchaia, in Arabia, as being %0a%3c more especially tbe country of frankincense. That region corresponds with %0a%3c the modern Yemen. It is, however, a well-ascertained fact, that it grows %0a%3c in India as well, and it is supposed that the greater part of it used by %0a%3c the ancients was in reality imported from that country. The Indian in- %0a%3c cense is the product of a tree belonging to the terebinth class, named by %0a%3c Roxburgh, who first discovered it, Boswellia thurifera. It is more espe- %0a%3c cially found in the mountainous parts of India. On the other hand, it has %0a%3c been asserted that the Arabian incense was tbe product of a coniferous tree, %0a%3c either the Juniperus Lycia, the Juniperus Phoenicea, or the Juniperus %0a%3c thurifera of Linnaeus. But, as Fee justly remarks, it would appear more %0a%3c reasonable to look among the terebinths of Arabia for the incense tree, if %0a%3c one of tliat class produces it in India, and more especially because the coni- %0a%3c ferous trees produce only resins, while the terebinths produce gum resins, %0a%3c to which class of vegetable products frankincense evidently belonged. In %0a%3c commerce, the gum resin, Oiibanum, the produce of the Boswellia serrata, %0a%3c and imported from the Levant, bears the name of frankincense. %0a%3c %0a%3c 98 Sec B. vi. c. 32.

It is the Sahaei alone, and no other %0a%3c people among the Arabians, that behold the incense-tree ; and, %0a%3c indeed, not all of them, for it is said that there are not more %0a%3c than three thousand families which have a right tQ claim that %0a%3c privilege, by virtue of hereditary succession; and that for this %0a%3c reason those persons are called sacred, and are not allowed, %0a%3c while pruning the trees or gathering the harvest, to receive, %0a%3c any pollution, cither by intercourse with women, or coming in %0a%3c contact with the dead ; by these religious observances it is %0a%3c that the price of the commodity is so considerably enhanced. %0a%3c Some persons, however, say, that the right of gathering in- %0a%3c cense in the forests belongs to all these people in common, %0a%3c while others again state, that they take their turns year by %0a%3c year. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 31. THE TREES THAT BEAR FRANKINCENSE. %0a%3c %0a%3c Nor is it by any means agreed what is the appearance of %0a%3c the incense-tree. We have sent several expeditions against %0a%3c A.rabia, and the Roman arms have penetrated into the greater %0a%3c part of that country ; indeed, Caius Csesar.''^ the son of Augus- %0a%3c tus, even earned considerable renown there ; and yet this tree %0a%3c has been described by no Latin writer, at least that I know %0a%3c of. The descriptions given of it by the Greek writers vary %0a%3c very considerably : some of them say that it has exactly the %0a%3c leaf of the pear-tree, only somewhat smaller, and of a grass- %0a%3c grccn colour. Others, again, say, that it has a rather reddish %0a%3c leaf, like that of the mastich, and others, that it is a kind of %0a%3c terebinth,'* and that King Antigonus, to whom a branch of it %0a%3c was brought, was of that opinion. King Juba, in the work %0a%3c which he wrote and dedicated to Caius Ca;sar, the son of %0a%3c Augustus, who was inflamed by the wide-spread rcno^Ti of %0a%3c Arabia, states, that the tree has a spiral stem, and that the %0a%3c branches bear a considerable resemblance to those of the Pontic %0a%3c maple, whUe it secretes a sort of juice very similar to that of %0a%3c %0a%3c " See B. vi. cc. 31 and 32.

The ambassadors %0a%3c who in my time have come to Home from Arabia, have made %0a%3c all these matters more uncertain, even, than they were before; %0a%3c a thing at which we may justly be surprised, seeing that %0a%3c some sprigs even of the incensc-treo have been brought among %0a%3c us, from which we have some reason to conclude that the %0a%3c parent tree is round and tapering, and that it puts forth its %0a%3c shoots from a trunk that is entirely free from knots. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 32. VAKIOTJS KINDS OF FRANKINCENSE. %0a%3c %0a%3c In former times, when they had fewer opportunities of %0a%3c selling it, they used to gather the frankincense only once a %0a%3c year ; but at the present day, as there is a much greater de- %0a%3c mand for it, there is a second crop as well. The first, and %0a%3c what we may call the natural, vintage, takes place about the %0a%3c rising of the Dog-star, a period when the heat is most intense ; %0a%3c on which occasion they cut the tree where the bark appears %0a%3c to be the fullest of juice, and extremely thin, from being dis- %0a%3c tended to the greatest extent. The incision thus made is gra- %0a%3c dually extended, but nothing is removed ; the consequence of %0a%3c which is, that an unctuous foam oozes forth, which gradually %0a%3c coagulates and thickens. When the nature of the locahty re- %0a%3c quires it, this juice is received upon mats of palm-leaves, though %0a%3c in some places the space around the tree is made hard by being %0a%3c well rammed down for the purpose. The frankincense that %0a%3c is gathered after the former method, is in the purest state, %0a%3c though that which falls on the ground is the heaviest in %0a%3c weight : that which adheres to the tree is pared off with an %0a%3c iron instrument, which accounts for its being found mingled %0a%3c with pieces of bark. %0a%3c %0a%3c The forest is allotted in certain portions, and such is the %0a%3c mutual probity of the owners, that it is quite safe from all %0a%3c depredation ; indeed, there is no one left to watch the trees %0a%3c after the incisions are made, and yet no one is ever known to %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 32.] TABIOTIS KINDS OF FRANKINCENSE. 1 27 %0a%3c %0a%3c plunder his neighbour. But, by Hercules! at Alexandria, %0a%3c where the incense is dressed for sale, the workshops can never %0a%3c be guarded with sufficient care ; a seal is even placed upon the %0a%3c workmen's aprons, and a mask put upon the head, or else a %0a%3c net with very close meshes, while the people are stripped %0a%3c naked before they are allowed to leave work. So true it is %0a%3c that punishments afford less security among us than is to be %0a%3c found by these Arabians amid their woods and forests ! The %0a%3c incense which has accumulated during the summer is gathered %0a%3c in the autumn : it is the purest of all, and is of a white colour. %0a%3c The second gathering takes place in spring, incisions being %0a%3c made in the bark for that purpose during the winter : this, %0a%3c however, is of a red colour, and not to be compared with the %0a%3c other incense. The first, or superior kind of incense, is known %0a%3c as carfiathum,'^ the latter is called dathiathum. It is thought, %0a%3c also, that the incense which is gathered from the tree while %0a%3c young is the whitest, though the produce of the old trees has %0a%3c the most powerful smell ; some persons, too, have an impres- %0a%3c sion that the best incense is found in the islands, but Juba %0a%3c asserts that no incense at all is grown there. %0a%3c %0a%3c That incense which has hung suspended in globular drops is %0a%3c known to us as "male" frankincense, although it is mostly %0a%3c the case that we do not use the term " male" except in con- %0a%3c tradistinction to the word " female :" it has been attributed, %0a%3c however, to religious scruples, that the name of the other sex %0a%3c was not employed as a denomination for this substance. Some %0a%3c persons, again, are of opinion that the male frankincense has %0a%3c been so called from its resemblance' to the testes of the male. %0a%3c The incense, however, that is the most esteemed of all is that %0a%3c which is mammose, or breast-shaped, and is produced when %0a%3c one drop has stopped short, and another, following close upon %0a%3c it, has adhered, and united with it. I find it stated that one %0a%3c of these lumps lascd to make quite a handful, at a time when %0a%3c men displayed less eagerness to gather it, and it was allowed %0a%3c more time to accumulate. The Greeks call such lumps as %0a%3c %0a%3c These words are said by some to he derived from the Greek, Kap(pdg, %0a%3c " a hollow stalk," ou account of its lii^litucss, and Sc;iSiov, " a torch," on %0a%3c nreount of its resinous and inflammable qualities. It is, however, much %0a%3c more probable that they were derived from the Arabic, and not from the %0a%3c Cclto-Scythic, as Poinsinet conjectures. %0a%3c %0a%3c ' Fee is probably riijht in his conjecture, that it was so called solely in %0a%3c consequence of its superior strength. . %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 128 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c pltnt's natural history.

After Alexandria had conquered Arabia, %0a%3c he despatched to Leonides a ship freighted with frankincense, %0a%3c and sent him word, requesting that he would now worship the %0a%3c gods without stint or limit. %0a%3c %0a%3c The incense, after being collected, is carried on camels' %0a%3c backs to Sabota,' at which place a single gate is left open for %0a%3c its admission. To deviate from the high road while convey- %0a%3c ing it, the laws have made a capital offence.

The incense %0a%3c can only be exported through the country of the Gebanitae, %0a%3c and for this reason it is that a certain tax is paid to their %0a%3c king as well.

(15.) MYERH. %0a%3c %0a%3c According to some authors, myrrh is the produce of a tree %0a%3c that grows in the same forests as the incense- tree, though %0a%3c most say that they grow in different places : but the fact is %0a%3c that myrrh grows in many parts of Arabia, as will be seen %0a%3c when we come to speak of the several varieties of it. A sort %0a%3c that is highly esteemed is brought from the islands'* also, and %0a%3c the Sabaii even cross the sea to procure it in the country of %0a%3c the Troglodytoc. It is grown also by being transplanted, and %0a%3c when thus cultivated is greatly preferred to that which is %0a%3c grown in the forests. The plant is greatly improved by raking %0a%3c %0a%3c " The Mediterranean. In c. 19 of the present Book. %0a%3c %0a%3c " It is supposed to bo the product of an amyris, but is not now esteemed %0a%3c as a perfume ; but is used in medicine as a toiiic. Forskhal has attributed %0a%3c to the Amyris kataf, or kafal, the production of myrrh. According to %0a%3c Ehrcnbergj'a very similar tree, though constituting a different species, the %0a%3c Balsamodendrum myrrha, also produces this substance. It is imported %0a%3c into Europe from both Abyssinia and Arabia. It was much used by the %0a%3c ancients, to flavour their wines. %0a%3c See B. vi. c. 32. %0a%3c %0a%3c VOL. III.

Some authors have said that the bark %0a%3c is smooth like that of the arbute, others, that it is rough and %0a%3c covered with thorns : it has the leaf of the olive, but more ■wavy, %0a%3c with sharp points at the edges : Juba says, however, that it %0a%3c resembles the leaf of the olusatrum. Some again say that it %0a%3c resembles the juniper,'^ only that it is rougher and bristlmg %0a%3c with thorns, and that the leaves are of a rounder shape, though %0a%3c they have exactly the taste of the juniper. There have been %0a%3c some writers who have incorrectly asserted that both myrrh %0a%3c and frankincense are the product of the same tree. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 35. THE NATUEE AND VAEIOUS KINDS OF MYEKH. %0a%3c %0a%3c Incisions are made in the myrrh-tree also twice a year, and at %0a%3c the same season as in the incense-tree ; but in the case of the %0a%3c myrrh- tree they are all made the way up from the root as far as %0a%3c the branches which are able to bear it. The tree spontaneously %0a%3c exudes, before the incision is made, a liquid which bears the %0a%3c name of stacte,^^ and to which there is no myrrh that is supe- %0a%3c rior. Second only in quality to this is the cultivated myrrh : %0a%3c of the wild or forest kind, the best is that which is gathered in %0a%3c summer. They give no tithes of myrrh to the god, because it %0a%3c is the produce of other countries as well ; but the growers pay %0a%3c the fourth part of it to the king of the Gebanitse. Myrrh is %0a%3c bought up indiscriminately by the common people, and then %0a%3c packed into bags ; but our perfumers separate it without any %0a%3c difficulty, the principal tests of its goodness being its unctuous- %0a%3c ness and its aromatic smell.

Fee observes, that the modems %0a%3c know nothing positive as to the mode of extracting myrrh from the tree. %0a%3c See the account given by Ovid, Met. B. x. 1. 500 et seq. of the transforma- %0a%3c tion of Myrrha into this tree, — " The warm drops fall from the tree. The %0a%3c tears, even, have their own honour ; and the myrrh that distils from the %0a%3c bark bears the name of its mistress, and in no age" will remain unknown." %0a%3c %0a%3c " Fee remarks, that at the present day we are acquainted only with one %0a%3c kind of myrrh ; the fragments which bear an impression like those of naili %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 35.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 131 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c of myrrh; the first among the wild myrrhs is the Troglo- %0a%3c dytic; and the next are the Minsean, which includes the %0a%3c Atramitic, and that of Ausaritis, in the kingdom of the Geba- %0a%3c nit£E. A third kind is the Dianitic,'^ and a fourth is the %0a%3c mixed myrrh, or " all-sorts ;" a fifth, again, is the Sambra- %0a%3c cenian, which is brought from a city in the kingdom of the %0a%3c Sabaei, near the sea ; and a sixth is known by the name of %0a%3c Dusaritic. There is a white myrrh also, which is produced in %0a%3c only one spot, and is carried for sale to the city of Messalum. %0a%3c The Troglodytic myrrh is tested by its unctuousness, and its %0a%3c peculiai'ly dry appearance : it has also a dirty, rough look %0a%3c with it, but is more acrid than tlie other kinds. The Sambra- %0a%3c cenian myrrh has none of these faults, and is more sightly in %0a%3c appearance than any of them, though it is far from being %0a%3c so powerful. In general, however, the proof of its goodness %0a%3c consists in its being separated in little pieces of uneven shape, %0a%3c formed by the concretion of a whitish juice, which dries up %0a%3c Uttle by little. When broken it ought to exhibit white marks %0a%3c like the finger-nails, and to be slightly bitter to the taste. %0a%3c That of second quality is of a mottled appeai'ance within ; %0a%3c while of worse quality is that which is of a black colour %0a%3c within ; the very Avorst of all is that which is black on the %0a%3c outside as well. %0a%3c %0a%3c The price of myrrh varies according to the number of pur- %0a%3c chasers. Stacte is sold at prices which vary from three de- %0a%3c narii to forty per pound, while the very highest price of the %0a%3c cultivated myrrh is eleven denarii. Erythraean myrrh, the %0a%3c same, it is pretended, as Arabian mj^rrh, is sixteen denarii per %0a%3c pound, Troglodytic also, is sixteen denarii ; and that known as %0a%3c odoraria, or odoriferous myrrh, sells at fourteen. Myrrh is %0a%3c adulterated with pieces of mastich, and other gums ; it is also %0a%3c drugged with the juice of wild cucumber, in order to produce %0a%3c a. certain bitterness, and with litharge for the purpose of in- %0a%3c creasing its weight. Other sophistications may be discovered %0a%3c on tasting it, and the gum will adhere to the teeth. But the %0a%3c %0a%3c being not a distinct kind, but a simple variety in appearance only. He %0a%3c thinks, also, that Pliny may very possibly be describing several distinct %0a%3c resinous products, under the one name of myrrh. An account of these %0a%3c various districts will be found in B. vi. c. 32. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hardouin suggests that it may be so called from the island of Dia, %0a%3c mentioned by Strabo, B. xvi. %0a%3c %0a%3c " Collatitia."

(17.) MASTICH. %0a%3c %0a%3c The transition, therefore,^^ is very easy to mastich, which %0a%3c grows upon another prickly shrub of India and Arabia, known %0a%3c by the name of laina. Of mastich as well there are two dif- %0a%3c ferent kinds ; for in Asia and Greece there is also found a herb %0a%3c which puts forth leaves from the root, and bears a thistly %0a%3c head, resembling an apple, and full of seeds. Upon an inci- %0a%3c sion being made in the upper part of this plant drops distil %0a%3c from it, which can hardly be distinguished from the genuine %0a%3c mastich. There is, again, a third sort,""'' found in Pontus, but %0a%3c more like bitumen than anything else. The most esteemed, %0a%3c however, of all these, is the white mastich of Chios, the price %0a%3c of which is twenty denarii per pound, while the black mastich %0a%3c sells at twelve. It is said that the mastich of Chios exudes %0a%3c from the lentisk in the form of a sort of gum : like frank- %0a%3c incense, it is adulterated with resin. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP, 37. LADANUM AND STOBOLON. %0a%3c %0a%3c , Arabia, too, still, boasts of her ladanum.'^ Many writers %0a%3c %0a%3c 20 "What this was is now unknown. Fee suggests that it may have been %0a%3c bdellium, which is found in considerable quantities in the myrrh that is %0a%3c imported at the present day. %0a%3c %0a%3c '■^1 This is most probably the meaning of Pliny's expression — "Ergo %0a%3c transit in mastichen ;" though Hardouin reads it as meaning that myrrh %0a%3c sometimes degenerates to mastich : and Fee, understanding the passage in %0a%3c the same sense, remarks that the statement is purely fabulous. Mastich, %0a%3c he says, is the produce of the Pistacia lentiscus of Linnaeus, which abouncb %0a%3c in Greece and the other parts of southern Europe. The greater part of %0a%3c the mastich of commerce comes from the island of Chio. It is impossible %0a%3c to conjecture to what plant Pliny here alludes, with the head of a thistle. %0a%3c %0a%3c 2- This kind, Fee says, is quite unknown to the moderns. %0a%3c %0a%3c 23 This substance is still gathered from the Cistus creticus of Linnseus, %0a%3c which is supposed to be the same as the plant leda, mentioned by Plmj- %0a%3c It is also most probably the same as the Cisthon, mentioned by liny m %0a%3c B. xxiv. c. 48. It is very commonly found in Spain. The substance is %0a%3c gathered from off the leaves, not by the aid of goats, but with whips fur- %0a%3c nished with several thongs, with which the shrabs are beaten. There are %0a%3c two sorts of ladanum known in commerce ; the one friable, and mixed with %0a%3c earthy substances, and known as " ladanum in tortis ;" the other black, and %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 37.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c LADAITUM AKD STOBOLON. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 133 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c have stated that this substance is the fortuitous result of an ac- %0a%3c cidental injury inflicted upon a certain odoriferous plant, under %0a%3c the following circumstances : the goat, they say, which is in %0a%3c general an animal that is exti'cmely mischievous to foliage, is %0a%3c particularly fond of the shrubs that are odoriferous, as if, in- %0a%3c deed, it were really sensible of the value that is set upon %0a%3c them. Hence it is that as the animal crops the sprouting %0a%3c shoots of the branches which are swollen with a liquid juice %0a%3c of remarkable sweetness, these juices drop and become min- %0a%3c gled together, and are then wiped up by the shaggy hairs of %0a%3c its unlucky beard. Being there mingled with the dust, these %0a%3c juices form knots and tufts, and are then dried by the sun ; %0a%3c and hence the circumstance is accounted for that in the lada- %0a%3c num which is imported by us we find goats' hairs. This, %0a%3c however, we are told, occurs nowhere but among the Naba- %0a%3c taei," a people of Arabia, who border upon Syria. The more %0a%3c recent writers call this substance by the name of stobolon, and %0a%3c state that in the forests of Arabia the trees are broken by the %0a%3c goats while browzing, and that the juices in consequence ad- %0a%3c here to their shaggy hair ; but the genuine " ladanum, they %0a%3c assure us, comes from the island of Cyprus. I make mention of %0a%3c this in order that every kind of odoriferous plant may be taken %0a%3c some notice of, even though incidentally and not in the order %0a%3c of their respetive localities. They say also that this Cyprian %0a%3c ladanum is collected in the same manner as the other, and %0a%3c that it forms a kind of greasy substance or oesypum,-' which %0a%3c adheres to the beards and shaggy legs of the goats ; but that %0a%3c it is produced from the flowers of the ground-ii^y, which they %0a%3c have nibbled when in quest of their morning food, a time at %0a%3c which the whole island is covered with dew. After this, they %0a%3c say, when the fogs are dispersed by the sun, the dust adheres %0a%3c to their wet coats, and the ladanum is formed, which is after- %0a%3c wards taken ofl' of them with a comb. %0a%3c %0a%3c There are some authors who give to the plant of Cyprus, %0a%3c from which it is made, the name of leda ; and hence it is that %0a%3c %0a%3c Boft to the fingers, the only adventitious substances in which are a little %0a%3c sand and a few hairs. %0a%3c ■* Sec B. vi. c. 32. %0a%3c %0a%3c For some fiu'ther account of this substance, see B. xxix. c. 10. Filthy %0a%3c as it was, the cesypum, or sweat and grease of sheep, was used by the %0a%3c Roman ladies as one of their most choice cosmetics.

THE TREE CALLED BRITTTS. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence it is, that they import from the country of the %0a%3c Elymsei ^ the wood of a tree called bratus,"* which is similar in %0a%3c appearance to a spreading cypress. Its branches are of a %0a%3c whitish colour, and the wood, while burning, emits a pleasant %0a%3c odour; it is highly spoken of by Claudius Cajsar, in his %0a%3c History,^" for its marvellous properties. He states that the %0a%3c Parthians sprinkle the leaves of it in their drink, that its smell %0a%3c closely resembles that of the cedar, and that the smoke of it is %0a%3c efficacious in counteracting the effects of smoke emitted by %0a%3c other wood. This tree grows in the countries that lie beyond %0a%3c the Pasitigris,'' in the territory of the city of Sittaca, upon %0a%3c Mount Zagrus. %0a%3c %0a%3c CUAP. 40. THE TREE CALLED STOBEXJM. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Arabians import from Carmania also the wood of a %0a%3c tree called stobrura,^^ which they employ in fumigations, by %0a%3c steeping it in palm wine, and then setting fire to it. The %0a%3c odour first ascends to the ceiling, and then descends in volumes %0a%3c %0a%3c " See B. vi. c. 31. %0a%3c %0a%3c 2f Although the savin shrub, the Juniperus Sabina of Linnaeus, bears %0a%3c this name in Greek, it is evident, as Fee says, that Pliny does not allude %0a%3c to it, but to a coniferous tree, as it is tliat family which produces a resinous %0a%3c wood with a balsamic odour when ignited. Bauhin and others would %0a%3c make the tree meant to be the Thuya occidentalis of Linnaeus ; but, as Fee %0a%3c observes, that tree is in reality a native originally of Canada, while the %0a%3c Thuya orientalis is a native of Japan.

But %0a%3c at a later period, as Juba informs us, they began to take the %0a%3c road, for the purposes of this traffic, to Charax^* and the %0a%3c kingdom of the Parthians. For my own part, it would appear %0a%3c to me that they were in the habit of importing these commo- %0a%3c dities among the Persians, even before they began to convey %0a%3c them to SjTia or Egj'pt ; at least Herodotus bears testimony to %0a%3c that effect, when he states that the Arabians paid a yearly %0a%3c tribute of one thousand talents, in frankincense, to the kings %0a%3c of Persia. %0a%3c %0a%3c From Syria they bring back storax,^* which, burnt upon %0a%3c the hearth, by its powerful smell dispels that loathing of their %0a%3c own perfumes with which these people are affected. For in %0a%3c general there are no kinds of wood in use among them, except %0a%3c those whftch are odoriferous ; indeed, the Sabaei are in the %0a%3c habit of cooking their food with incense wood, while others, %0a%3c again, employ that of the myrrh tree ; and hence, the smoke %0a%3c and smells that pervade their cities and villages are no other %0a%3c than the v.ery same which, with us, proceed from the altars. %0a%3c For the- purpose of qualifying this powerful smell, they burn %0a%3c storax in goat-skins, and so fumigate their dwellings. So true %0a%3c it is, that there is no pleasure to be found, but what the con- %0a%3c tinual enjoyment of it begets loathing. They also burn this %0a%3c substance to drive away the serpents, which are extremely %0a%3c numerous in the forests which bear the odoriferous trees. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 41.

Those who are likely to be the best %0a%3c acquainted with the matter, assert that this country does not %0a%3c produce, in a Avhole year, so large a quantity of perfumes as %0a%3c was burnt by the Emperor Nero at the funeral obsequies of %0a%3c his wife Poppaea. And then let us only take into account %0a%3c the vast number of funerals that are celebrated throughout the %0a%3c whole world each year, and the heaps of odours that are %0a%3c piled up in honour of the bodies of the dead ; the vast quanti- %0a%3c ties, too, that are offered to the gods in single grains ; and yet, %0a%3c when men were in the habit of offering up to them the salted %0a%3c cake, they did not show themselves any the less propitious ; %0a%3c nay, rather, as the facts themselves prove, they were even %0a%3c more favourable to us than they are now. But it is the sea of %0a%3c Arabia that has even a still greater right to be called " happy," %0a%3c for it is this that furnishes us with pearls. At the very lowest %0a%3c computation, India, the Seres, and the Arabian Peninsula, %0a%3c withdraw from our empire one hundred millions of sesterces %0a%3c ever)' year — so dearlj- do we pay for our luxury and our %0a%3c women.

XYLOCINNAMUM. %0a%3c %0a%3c Fabulous antiquity, and Herodotus^® more particularly, have %0a%3c related that cinnamomum and cassia are fouud in the nests of %0a%3c certain birds, and principally that of the phoenix, in the dis- %0a%3c tricts where Father Liber was brought up ; and that these sub- %0a%3c stances either fall from the inaccessible rocks and trees in %0a%3c which the nests ai-e built, in consequence of the weight of the %0a%3c pieces of flesh which the birds carry up, or else are brought %0a%3c down by the aid of arrows loaded with lead. It is said, also, %0a%3c %0a%3c ^ Because its perfumes were held in such high esteem, for burning on %0a%3c the piles of the dead. This, of course, was done primarily to avoid the %0a%3c offensive smell. %0a%3c %0a%3c " The bark of the Cinnamomum Zeylanicum of the modern naturalists, %0a%3c the cinuamcn-tree of Ceylon. %0a%3c 38 B. iii. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 138 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c PLIKT's NATURA-L bistoet. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c n^ook xn. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c that cassia grows around certain marshes, but is protected by %0a%3c a frightful kind of bat armed with claws, and by winged ser- %0a%3c pents as well. All these tales, however, have been evidently %0a%3c invented for the purpose of enhancing the prices of these %0a%3c commodities. Another story, too, bears them company, to the %0a%3c effect that under the rays of the noon-day sun, the entire %0a%3c peninsula exhales a certain indescribable perfume composed of %0a%3c its numerous odours ; that the breezes, as they blow from it, %0a%3c are impregnated with these odours, and, indeed, were the first %0a%3c to announce the vicinity of Arabia to the fleets of Alexander %0a%3c the Great, while still far out at sea. All this, however, is %0a%3c false ; for cinnamomum, or cinnamum, which is the same thing, %0a%3c grows in the country of the Ethiopians,*" who are united by %0a%3c intermarriages with the Troglodyta). These last, after buying %0a%3c it of their neighbours, carry it over vast tracts of sea, upon %0a%3c rafts, which are neither steered by rudder, nor drawn or %0a%3c impelled by oars or sails. Nor yet are they aided by any of the %0a%3c resources of art, man alone, and his daring boldness, standing %0a%3c in place of all these ; in addition to which, they choose the %0a%3c winter season, about the time of the equinox, for their voyage, %0a%3c for then a south easterly wind is blowing ; these winds guide %0a%3c them in a straight course from gulf to gulf, and after they %0a%3c have doubled the promonotory of Arabia, the north east wind %0a%3c carries them to a port of the Gebanitae, known by the name of %0a%3c Ocilia.''*' Hence it is that they steer for this port in preference ; %0a%3c and they say that it is almost five years before the mer- %0a%3c chants are able to effect their return, while many perish on %0a%3c the voyage. In return for their wares, they bring back arti- %0a%3c cles of glass and copper, cloths, buckles, bracelets, and neck- %0a%3c laces ; hence it is that this traffic depends more particularly %0a%3c upon the capricious tastes and inclinations of the female sex. %0a%3c %0a%3c The cinnamon shrub" is only two cubits in height, at the %0a%3c most, the lowest being no more than a palm in height.

The leaf ia %0a%3c like that of wild marjoram, and it thrives best in dry localities, %0a%3c being not so prolific in rainy weather ; it requires, also, to be %0a%3c kept constantly clipped. Though it grows on level ground, it %0a%3c thrives best among tangled brakes and brambles, and hence %0a%3c it is extremely difficult to be gathered. It is never gathered %0a%3c unless with the permission of the god, by whom some suppose %0a%3c Jupiter to be meant; the Ethiopians, however, call him %0a%3c Assabinus." They offer the entrails of forty-four oxen, goats, %0a%3c and rams, when they implore his permission to do so, but after %0a%3c all, they are not allowed to work at it before sunrise or after %0a%3c sunset. A priest divides the branches with a spear, and sets %0a%3c aside one portion of them for the god ; after which, the dealer %0a%3c stores away the rest in lumps. There is another account given, %0a%3c which states that a division is made between the gatherers and %0a%3c the sun, and that it is divided into three portions, after which %0a%3c lots are twice drawn, and the share which falls to the sun is %0a%3c left there, and forthwith ignites spontaneously. %0a%3c %0a%3c The thinnest parts in the sticks, for about a palm in length, %0a%3c are looked upon as producing the finest cinnamon ; the part %0a%3c that comes next, though not quite so long, is the next best, %0a%3c and so on downwards. The worst of aU is that which is %0a%3c nearest the roots, from the circumstance that in that part %0a%3c there is the least bark, the portion that is the most esteemed : %0a%3c hence it is that the upper part of the tree is preferred, there %0a%3c being the greatest proportion of bark there. As for the wood, %0a%3c it is held in no esteem at all, on account of the acrid taste %0a%3c which it has, like that of wild marjoram ; it is known as %0a%3c xylocinnamum." The price of cinnamomum is ten denarii per %0a%3c pound. Some writers make mention of two kinds of cinna- %0a%3c mon, the white and the black : the white was the one that was %0a%3c formerly preferred, but now, on the contrary, the black is held %0a%3c in the highest estimation, and the mottled, even, is preferred to %0a%3c the white. The most certain test, however, of the goodness ol %0a%3c cinnamon is its not being rough, and the fact that the pieces %0a%3c when rubbed together do not readily crumble to powder. That %0a%3c which is soft is more particularly rejected, which is the case, %0a%3c also, when the outer bark too readily falls off. %0a%3c %0a%3c *- See c. 33 of the present Book, and the Note. %0a%3c 43 Or " wood of cinnamon." %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 140 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c pli>y's natcuax uisjouy. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book.

It is of a purple colour, and though of %0a%3c considerable volume, weighs but very little in comparison ; the %0a%3c outer coat forms into short tubes which are by no means easily %0a%3c broken : this choice kind of cassia, the barbarians call by the %0a%3c name of lada. There is another sort, again, which is called %0a%3c balsaraodes,** because it has a smell like that of balsam, but it %0a%3c is bitter ; for which reason it is more employed for medicinal %0a%3c purposes, just as the black cassia is used for unguents.

The kind that grows in Arabia is known as %0a%3c Syriaca, and is white, while, on the other hand, that which %0a%3c grows in the Thebais is black : the former is preferred for the %0a%3c quality of the oil extracted from it, though that which is pro- %0a%3c %0a%3c 52 A gum resin of some unknown species, but not improbably, Fee %0a%3c thinks, the produce of some of tbe Amyrides.

It is said that the Egyptian nut is even more olea- %0a%3c ginous, being of a reddish colour ^vith. a thicker shell, and %0a%3c that the plant, although it grows in wet, marshy spots, is %0a%3c shorter and drier than the other kinds. The Arabian nut, %0a%3c again, is said to be of a green colour and of smaller size, but %0a%3c harder and more compact, from the circumstance that it grows %0a%3c in mountainous districts. The best of all, however, is that of %0a%3c Petra, which comes from a city mentioned*®* on a previous %0a%3c occasion ; it has a black shell, but the kernel is white.

In former times it was cultivated in %0a%3c two gardens only, both of which belonged to the kings of that %0a%3c country: one of them was no more than twenty jugera in %0a%3c extent, and the other somewhat smaller. The emperors Ves- %0a%3c pasianus and Titus had this shrub exhibited at Home ; indeed, %0a%3c it is worthy of signal remark, that since the time of Pompeius %0a%3c Magnus, we have been in the habit of carrying trees even in %0a%3c our triumphal processions. At the present day this tree pays %0a%3c us homage and tribute along with its native land, but it has %0a%3c been found to be of altogether a different nature to that which %0a%3c %0a%3c '» Or "red sceptre," probably so called from the flowers clustering along %0a%3c tlic whole h'ngth of the branches. %0a%3c %0a%3c " A liquid matter extracted from the beaver. %0a%3c %0a%3c " Generally regarded as identical with the Teucrium Marum of I.innaeu?, %0a%3c a sweet-smelling shrub found in the south of Europe and the East, by us %0a%3c fonimonly known as "herb mastich," somewhat similar to marjoram. %0a%3c Ft'o says 'that the marum of Egypt is a kind of sage, the Salvia ^thiopis %0a%3c of Linnaeus. %0a%3c %0a%3c Balsam (or balm of Mecca, as it is sometimes called) is the produce %0a%3c of two trees, probably varieties of one another, of the terebinth family, %0a%3c belonging to the genus Amyris. So far from bring a native solely of %0a%3c Judtea, llruce assures us that its original country was that which produces %0a%3c myrrh, in the ^-ieinity of Mabelniandel, and that the inhabitants use the %0a%3c wood solely for fuel. In Judiea it appears to have been cultivated solely %0a%3c in gardi ns ; and it was this tree which produced the famous balm of Gilead %0a%3c of Scripture. The balsam trees known to us do not at all correspond with %0a%3c I'liny's description, as they do not resemble either the vine or myrtle, nor %0a%3c are their leaves at all like those of rue. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 148 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c PLIXY's natural H18T0UT. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XII. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c our own as well as foreign writers had attributed to it : for, in %0a%3c fact, it bears a much stronger resemblance to the vine than to %0a%3c the myrtle. This recent acquisition by conquest has leami'd, %0a%3c like the vine, to be reproduced by mallet'''-shoot8, aud it %0a%3c covers declivities just like the vine, which supports its own %0a%3c weight without the aid of stays. When it puts Ibrth branchog %0a%3c it is primed in a similar manner, and it thrives by being well %0a%3c raked at the roots, growing with remarkable rapidity, and %0a%3c bearing fruit at the end of three years. The leaf bears a very %0a%3c considerable resemblance to that of rue, and it is an em- %0a%3c green. The Jews vented their rage upon this shrub just as %0a%3c they were in the habit of doing against their own lives and %0a%3c persons, while, on the other hand, the llomans protected it ; iu- %0a%3c deed, combats have taken place before now in defence of a shrub. %0a%3c At the present day the reproduction of it has become a duty %0a%3c of the fiscal authorities, and the plants were never known to %0a%3c he more numerous or of larger growth ; they never exceed the %0a%3c height, however, of a couple of cubits. %0a%3c %0a%3c There are three different kinds of balsamum. Tlie first has %0a%3c a thin and hair-like foliage, and is known by the name of %0a%3c eutheriston.^' The second is of a rugged appearance, bending %0a%3c downwards, full of branches, and more odoriferous than the %0a%3c first ; the name of this is trachy. The third kind is the %0a%3c eumeces, so called, because it is taller than the others ; it has %0a%3c a smooth, even, bark. It is the second in quality, the euthe- %0a%3c riston being inferior to the trachy. The seed of this plant %0a%3c has a flavour strongly resembling that of wine ; it is of a %0a%3c reddish colour, and not without a certain amount of unctuous- %0a%3c ness ; the grains of inferior quality are lighter in weight and %0a%3c of a greener hue : the branches of the shrub are thicker than %0a%3c those of the myrtle. Incisions are made in it either with %0a%3c glass, or else a sharp stone, or knives made of bone : it being %0a%3c highly injurious to touch the vital parts with iron, for in sucii %0a%3c case it will immediately wither away and die. On the other %0a%3c hand, it will allow of all the superfluous branches being pruned %0a%3c away with an instrument of iron even. The hand of the %0a%3c %0a%3c " Malleolis." So called when the new shoot of the tree springing from %0a%3c a branch of the former year, is cut off for the sake of planting, with a bit %0a%3c of the old wood on each side of it, in the form of a mallet. %0a%3c %0a%3c " Easily cut."

The best seed is that which is the largest %0a%3c in size and the heaviest in weight ; it has a biting or rather %0a%3c burning taste in the mouth, Balsamum is adulterated with %0a%3c hypericon'** from Petra, but the fraud is easily detected, from %0a%3c the fact that the grains of the latter are larger, comparatively %0a%3c empty, and longer than those of balsamum ; they are destitute %0a%3c also of any pungency of smell, and have a flavour like that %0a%3c of pepper. %0a%3c %0a%3c As to the tears of balsamum, the test of their goodness is %0a%3c their being unctuous to the touch, small, of a somewhat reddish %0a%3c colour, and odoriferous when subjected to friction. That of %0a%3c second-rate quality is white ; the green and coarse is inferior, %0a%3c and the black is the worst of all ; for, like olive-oil, it is apt %0a%3c to turn rancid when old. Of all the incisions, the produce is %0a%3c considered the best of those from which the liquid has flowed %0a%3c before the formation of the seed. In addition to what has %0a%3c been already stated, it is often adulterated with the juice of %0a%3c the seed, and it is with considerable difficulty that the fraud is %0a%3c detected by a slight bitterness in the taste, which ought to be %0a%3c delicate and without the slightest mixture of acidity, the only %0a%3c pungency being that of the smell. It is adulterated also with %0a%3c oil of roses, of Cyprus, of mastich, of balanus, of turpentine, %0a%3c and of myrtle, as also with resin, galbanum, and Cyprian wax, %0a%3c just as occasion may serve; But the very worst adulteration %0a%3c of all, is that which is eff'ected with gum, a substance which %0a%3c is dry when emptied into the hand, and falls to the bottom %0a%3c Avhen placed in water ; both of which are characteristics of the %0a%3c genuine commodity. Balsamum, in a genuine state, should bo %0a%3c (^uite hard, but when it is mixed with gum a brittle peUicle %0a%3c forms upon it. The fraud can also be detected by the taste, %0a%3c and when placed upon hot coals it may easily be seen if there %0a%3c has been any adulteration with wax and resin ; the flame too, in %0a%3c this case, burns with a blacker smoke than when the balsamum %0a%3c is pure. When mixed with honey its qualities are imme- %0a%3c diately changed, for it will attract flies even in the hand. In %0a%3c addition to these various tests, a drop of pure balsamum, if %0a%3c placed in hike-warm water will settle to the bottom of the %0a%3c 's* See B. xxvi. cc. 53, 54.

The tear has a harsh taste, with a %0a%3c pleasant smell ; in the interior it has all the appearance of a reed, %0a%3c and is filled with a liquid juice. About the rising of the Dog- %0a%3c star, certain small winged worms hover about this substance %0a%3c and eat it away, for which reason it is often found in a rotten %0a%3c state, with worm-holes full of dust. The storax next in esti- %0a%3c mation after that already mentioned, comes from Pisidia, %0a%3c Sidon, Cyprus, and Cilicia ; that of Crete being considered the %0a%3c very worst of all. That which comes from Mount Amanus, %0a%3c in Syria, is highly esteemed for medicinal purposes, and even %0a%3c more so by the perfumers. From whatever country it comes, %0a%3c that which is of a red colour is preferred, and it should be %0a%3c both unctuous as well as viscous to the touch ; the worst kind %0a%3c is that which crumbles like bran, and is covered all over with %0a%3c a whitish mould.

The %0a%3c storax of commerce appears in three states — grain storax, with which Pliny %0a%3c does not appear to have been acquainted ; amygdalite, which is perhaps %0a%3c ttie sort which he speaks of as adulterated with bitter almonds; and lump %0a%3c storax, of reddish brown colour, which is frequently mixed with wood dust, %0a%3c or worm dust, as mentioned by Pliny, and is but little esteemed.

Egypt produces it %0a%3c in still greater abundance ; but that which is the most esteemed %0a%3c of all comes from India, where it is said to grow in the marshes %0a%3c like the lentil. It has a more powerful odour than saffron, %0a%3c and has a black, rough appearance, with a sort of brackish %0a%3c taste. The white is the least approved of all, and it very soon %0a%3c turns musty when old. In taste it ought to be similar to %0a%3c nard, when placed under the tongue.

Clu- %0a%3c sius thinks that the name is derived from the Indian Tamalpatra, the name %0a%3c given from time immemorial to the leaf of a tree known by the Arabs as %0a%3c tlie Cadcgi-indi, possibly the same as the Katou-carua of the Malabars. %0a%3c %0a%3c From the Greek o/x^d/ctov, being made of unripe grapes.

That is of an inferior quality which %0a%3c is made from the druppa — such being the name that is given %0a%3c to the olive before it is ripe and fit for food, but already %0a%3c beginning to change its colour. The difference between them %0a%3c is, that the latter kind is green, the former white. The om- %0a%3c phacium that is made from the vine is extracted from either %0a%3c the psythian^ or the Amiuean grape, when the grapes are %0a%3c about the size of a chick-pea, just before the rising of the Dog. %0a%3c star. The grape is gathered when the first bloom is appearing %0a%3c upon it, and the verjuice is extracted, after which the residue"* %0a%3c is left to dry in the sun, due precautions being taken against %0a%3c the dews of the night. The verjuice, after being collected, is %0a%3c put into earthen vessels, and then, after that, stored in jars %0a%3c of Cyprian copper.^" The best kind is that Avhich is of a %0a%3c reddish colour, acrid, and dry to the taste. The price at %0a%3c which it sells is six denarii per pound. Omphacium is also %0a%3c made another way — the unripe grape is pounded in a mortar, %0a%3c after which it is dried in the sun, and then divided into %0a%3c lozenges. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 61.

A %0a%3c %0a%3c remarks, that made from the olive is correctly described as a kind of oil, %0a%3c but that made from the grape must have been a rob, or pure verjuice. %0a%3c These two liquids must have had totally different qualities, and resembled %0a%3c each other in nothing but the name. That extracted from the olive is %0a%3c mentioned again in B. xxiii. c. 4, in reference to its medicinal properties. %0a%3c These grapes are described in B. xiv. c. 4 and c. 11. %0a%3c %0a%3c -9 " Reliquum corpus."

This %0a%3c is the more probable, as we find Pliny here speaking of the oonanthe, or vine- %0a%3c flower, by which Fee supposes that he means the blossom of the Vitis %0a%3c vinifera of Linnaeus, which exhales a delightful perfume. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 63.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c CINNAMON OR COMA CUM. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 155 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c bryon of second-rate quality is produced from the cedar of %0a%3c Lycia.'* Qilnanthe, too, bears an affinity to these substances, %0a%3c being the clusters of the wild vine : it is gathered when it is %0a%3c in flower, or, in other words, when it has the finest smell : %0a%3c after which it is dried in the shade upon a linen sheet spread %0a%3c beneath it, and then stored away in casks. The best sort is %0a%3c that which comes from Parapotamia ; ^ the next best kinds are %0a%3c those made at Antiochia and Laodicea in Syria ; and that of %0a%3c third-rate quality, comes from the mountainous parts of Media ; %0a%3c this last, however, is preferable for medicinal purposes.
