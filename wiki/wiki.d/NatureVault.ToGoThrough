Lesion size was correlated wih the changes. thalamus plays a vital role in managing sensory function, arousal, level of awareness, and certain cognitive functions [6,7,8]; importantly, the thalamus regulates the flow of visual, auditory and motor information.%0a%0a[[Mycoplasma]] causes strokes [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8207792/|#]] also with [[PCOS]] which might be [[wuchereria]] or [[strongyloides]]. Also had [[pseudomonas]] treated with acetylsalicylic acid at 100 mg once daily for secondary stroke prevention, folic acid at 5 mg once daily, hydroxocobalamin IM once/month. Mycoplasma caused delerious sexual fantasies so might be one responsible agent for sexual fantasies or sexual addiction. Patient also couldn't look up after partial recovery which I had trouble doing after treatment with essential oils for thalamus infarct, probably causes [[strabisimus]]. Patient had acute issues after living with elderly. For me it seems like the infarct is from a biofilm in the nervous system that spans from the spinal cord in the neck and the back and sides of neck through the brain and meninges to the soft spot in the skull to the eyes and eye sockets amd nasopharanx all the way down to the heart, probably even the kidneys and wrists. What bacteria (pseudomonas?) or mycoplasma could be causing the biofilm? Putting the treatment essential oils on scalp and forehead. Also feel stiffness in sides of neck which is uncommon, I did have that bacteria that stiffens the neck arteries several years ago, forgot its name.%0a%0aThalamus infarct after [[covid-19]] [[vaccine]] [[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35846505/|#]]%0a%0aMigraine [[chronic fatigue]] mood disorders [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8209296/|#]]%0a%0aRole of thalamus in [[chronic fatigue]] in [[multiple sclerosis]] [[https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1352458519851247|#]] mostly demyleination but might make thalamus infarct have similar symptoms to [[MS]]. thalamic atrophy along with basal ganglia and fronto–parietal cortex volume loss, in MS patients with fatigue.

Also that it has [[serotonin]] innervation which may mean that with thalamus infarct the body increases serotonin to communicate leading to a relatively low dopamine and propensity to serotonin syndrome in infarct patients. Thalamus invopved with shifts into wakefullness and rem so night terrors might be a thalamus infarct or mini stroke.%0a%0aCystic fibrosis is a war between [[pseudomonas]] and [[s aureus]] [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8770549/|#]]%0a%0aS aureus is a biofilm producer [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3385245/|#]]%0a%0aStroke most often caused by [[streptococcus]] and [[neisseria]] sometimes [[cysticercosis]] [[parasite]] [[https://www.pfmjournal.org/m/journal/view.php?number=80|#]]%0a%0aNeisseria forms strong biofilms and integrates human dna and causes foul smelling discharge from penis [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neisseria_gonorrhoeae|#]] causes [[meningitis]] and [[endocarditis]] [[tenosynovitis]] [[arthritis]]%0a%0aTreponema cause infection of umbilical cord [[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7628852/|#]] what about [[nuchal cord]] cord wrapped around neck?%0a%0aTreponema syphilis can cause thalamus infarct which causes issues with vertical gaze and also [[migraine]] and [[strabismus]] [[https://eyewiki.aao.org/Neuro-Ophthalmic_Manifestations_of_Thalamic_Disease|#]]%0a%0aTreponema can cause infection of nasopharanx causing degeneration of structures perhaps turbinates.%0a%0aTreponema cause brain and heart problems [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syphilis|#]] and often goes symptomless and undetected [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syphilis|#]] and aortic [[aneurysm]], [[dementia]], [[personality disorder]], [[depression]], [[seizure]], [[delusion]], [[gait]] instability, sharp stabbing pains, [[miscarriage]].

The final luster is given by polishing with flannel.%0aWhen gradually heated in an oil bath, amber "becomes soft and flexible. Two pieces of amber may be united by smearing the surfaces with linseed oil, heating them, and then pressing them together while hot. Cloudy amber may be clarified in an oil bath, as the oil fills the numerous pores that cause the turbidity. Small fragments, formerly thrown away or used only for varnish are now used on a large scale in the formation of "ambroid" or "pressed amber".[30] The pieces are carefully heated with exclusion of air and then compressed into a uniform mass by intense hydraulic pressure, the softened amber being forced through holes in a metal plate. The product is extensively used for the production of cheap jewelry and articles for smoking. This pressed amber yields brilliant interference colors in polarized light." Amber has often been imitated by other resins like copal and kauri gum, as well as by celluloid and even glass. Baltic amber is sometimes colored artificially but also called "true amber".%0a%0aComposition of resin/rosin but not the weight difference [[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/304982587_Chemical_Compositions_of_Pine_Resin_Rosin_and_Turpentine_Oil_from_West_Java|#]] [[https://archive.ph/OiSeI|#]] also this article shows how to dissolve the acidic fraction (rosin) using diethyl ether and 4%25 NaOH which means a little ash and salt in water shouldn't dissolve it but rather polymerize it while oxidizing turpentine to create heat.%0a%0aTurpentine from distillation of pine resin [[https://www.quora.com/What-type-of-trees-yield-the-resin-used-to-produce-turpentine|#]]%0a%0aOff the bat we have to assume amber is produced by pine-like trees that create 8%25 dry weight succinic acid in sap. Succinic acid may be produced with fermentation of glucose/xyloglucan but since succinate producing trees are known we have to assume that might be the only way 8%25 succinic acid could get in the resin. So the production method would be add 8%25 succinic acid to pine resin (probably mre to get 8%25 by dry weight, so determine the rosin weight vs resin weight and add corresponding succinic acid so it is 8%25 of rosin weight. Then alkalize ideally by putting the resin/succinic acid mix glob in ash to harden and dry.

Alkali (and potentially heat) should cause polymerization. However the alkaline chloride may also help polymerization, not sure. Since amber is found in the sea mostly, it shouldn't hurt to add the salt even if adding succinate makes it mostly pointless. Testing is required to figure this out. Try pine resin with and without added 6%25 succinic acid and add both to the ash/salt water mix and see which gets harder faster (and tougher).%0a%0a------%0a%0aPine sap uses salve pine sap, oil, beeswax.

Actually water, salt, ash, and [[hydrogen peroxide]] may help, and be a single step process.%0a%0aCopal treated in an autoclave can be used for jewlry [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copal|#]] which to me means it causes polymerization (from high temp, pressure, and steam). So heat over long periods can probably produce amber but it can be detected and is classified as reconstituted amber since it produces smaller crystalline grains. This heat treated copal is resistant to acetone wheras normal copal is not. Copal is good ingredient for wood varnish. Subfossil copal produces harder varnish.%0a%0aputting copal in the sun may be another way to produce amber by polymerization.%0a%0aAmber can also be used in varnish [[http://www.wetcanvas.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1422562|#]] [[https://natural-baltic-amber.com/amber-varnish/|#]] [[https://www.oldwood1700.com/en/product/classical-amber-varnish/|#]] made from amber powder and polymerized [[linseed oil]], which linseed oil can be polymerized in the sun via UV. Can be diluted with [[turpentine]]. Finished amber varnish after application to object can be improved in a UV chamber, which means putting copal in the sun may be another way to produce amber. Copal dissolves in turpentine wheras amber does not [[https://www.wetcanvas.com/forums/topic/amber-varnish-making-it/#post-1266361|#]]. Dissolvimg amber is possible however and is a trade secret [[https://www.wetcanvas.com/forums/topic/amber-varnish-making-it/page/2/#post-1266371|#]] and probably is special dangerous solvent heated. Actually amber is heated with linseed oil or walnut oil to dissolve it [[https://www.wetcanvas.com/forums/topic/amber-varnish-making-it/#post-1266360|#]] probably the linseed oil that has sat in the sun and then fully polymerized linseed oil added after amber has dissolved along with turpentine. The resultant may be black [[https://www.wetcanvas.com/forums/topic/amber-varnish-making-it/#post-1266362|#]] and probably clarified with [[activated clay]] [[clay]]. Needs raw linseed oil to dissolve amber, needs to be heated slowly to boiling, also acids dissolve amber [[https://www.wetcanvas.com/forums/topic/amber-varnish-making-it/#post-1266363|#]] to remove acid from acid dissolved amber (probably amber powder dissolved in concentrated [[phosphoric acid]]) probably similar to making regenerated cellulose from microcrystalline cellulose dissolved in phosphoric acid then stirred in water and centrifuged and repeated to remove the acid. In other words washing. Amber varnish is very dark and used in elite wood furniture varnish [[https://www.wetcanvas.com/forums/topic/amber-varnish-making-it/page/2/#post-1266374|#]]. So powdered amber is needed to have a chance to dissolve it in heated oil. Also it can probably be done under inert atmosphere (no oxygen) to prevent burning and allow to be heated to higher temp. Also perhaps turpentine can be used if heated under inert high pressure conditions, required because heating turpentine in air will cause it to spontaneously combust!%0a%0aAlcohol or other solvent on copal will soften it, amber will not soften [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gum_copal|#]]%0a%0aAmber was produced by pinus succinifera [[https://www.gemstones.com/articles/gemstone-copal-vs-amber|#]] trees so obviously they were high in succinate. Or possibly the succinate is formed from alkaline chloride attack.%0a%0aCopal vs amber [[https://www.gemstones.com/articles/gemstone-copal-vs-amber|#]]%0a%0aActually only baltic amber contains succinic acid 50-400ppm wheras other ambers do not [[https://analyticalsciencejournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/rcm.3886|#]] so it seems succinic acid is not necessary to produce amber from alkaline chlorode attack of copal (melted pine resin). So likely the alkaline chloride aging (fossilization) does not create succinate. Or it coupd be precisely that it was oxidized by chloride in the sea that produced the succinate...back to square one not sure whether succinate was produced by the tree or if it was produced from chloride attack on the copal. However it is good to know that even if we don't produce succinic acid that it can still become real amber by polymerization of melted pine resin (copal) likely due to alkaline chloride attack. However only baltic amber is jewlery grade [[https://www.getty.edu/publications/ambers/intro/5/|#]]%0a%0aDiscerning real amber [[https://www.balticessentials.com/blogs/news/learn-to-spot-fake-amber|#]] matte not glossy shine. Copal melts rather than burns, if it melts its copal if it burns it is amber, easiest test is see if a hot needle can pierce it. Acetone (nail polish remover) or [[HCL]] muriatic acid will dissolve copal and not effect amber (at room temperature). Amber has a pale glow under UV light wheras copal does not. Hot needle test says that autoclaved copal is the same as amber. Also autoclaved copal passes the solvent test. Flouresence test should determine amber more fluorescent than autoclaved copal. FTIR is best method to differentiate autoclaved copal from amber [[https://www.gemstones.com/articles/gemstone-copal-vs-amber|#]] which I believe relies on the heating of the copal changing the peorpertues. Artificially aged cold methods like alkaline chloride attack (soaking copal in salt and wood ash water) shouldn't fail the FTIR test. The chloride attack oxidizes and probably helps removal of volatiles. Also succinate peak is needed for baltic amber. No copals have succinate it seems which to me means that most likely the succinate is formed from alkaline chloride attack, or it couod have been prehistoric trees really did just produce more succinic acid. Amber goes pliable at 200c (so a heated press is great to make cohesive amber). I personally think the succinate is produced from oxygen vacancies (think chloride and blue sulfide rich earth) which are not created in an autoclave, but it is also possible it was fromthe specific trees themselves and in that case should be added to create real baltic amber.%0a%0aSubfossil copal found 1-2 meters below living copal trees [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copal|#]] producing harder varnish than normal copal.%0a%0aFuzzy white on insects from fungus probably and trichomes on plants not possible in autoclaved opal [[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Fly_in_amber,_Samland_Peninsula_along_the_Baltic_Sea_RU.jpg|#]] but probably possible on cold aged (alkaline chloride) copal%0a%0aBaltic amber in samland penninsula in blue earth layer [[https://www.getty.edu/publications/ambers/intro/5/|#]] interesting because to me blue earth means high in hydrogen sulfide which is reducing agent not oxidizing. But we know that sulfur radicals can also induce oxygen vacancies producing the same effect as alkaline chloride.%0a%0a%0aThings that cannot be shipped international like certain seeds [[https://www.myus.com/benefits/shipping/customs-help/restrictions/|#]] [[https://www.usglobalmail.com/prohibited-export-items-internationally/|#]]%0a%0aLook into beans [[favism]] [[blood clot]].

Yes molasses is 78.1 brix or 78.5-79+ [[https://www.ams.usda.gov/sites/default/files/media/Sugarcane_Molasses_Standard%255B1%255D.pdf|#]] so perhaps we can define maple molasses as 76-78+ brix concentrated maple sap with temperature reaching at least 70c during concentration and remains pourable in human usable timescales (seconds, not over a minute), 80c and above prefered for vanillin production. Can be done under acidic or neutral conditions. Natural organic acids can be added to darken and assist hydrolysis of sucrose into glucose and fructose but not required. Some or all remaining crystalizable sugar can be removed but not required. Any brix maple sap with water removed that is concentrated to any degree or completely while temperature always remaining at or below 61.8c (via crystallization or separation [like reverse osmosis] or more likely boiling under vacuum or evaporating at low heat) may be called maple syrum. Very light maple molasses that has low vannila flavor (produced between 61.8c to 79.5c) can be called maple hunny. Brief periods to 80-81.9 c develop vanilla flavor but this may be able to revert back if the temperature is promptly lowered. Maple syrum, molasses and hunny should preferably be unfiltered to leave minerals and antioxidants, also no additives at all can be added to prevent foaming or any other use (besides optional organic acids for making molasses).%0a%0aMaple hunny is more natural (unfiltered and no anti-foaming agents), more shelf stable (higher brix - lower water content), less sweet (less vanillin production from keeping temp below 80c at all times) than maple syrup.%0a%0aMaple sap honey (maple honey is from bees visiting maple blossoms) is made by concentrating maple sap tp 30 brix (~10x from where it started) at or below 61.8c and then feeding it to bees as their sole nectar source. Concentration could be using a pan on the stove on low, vacuum distillation, reverse osmosis, even jacking (freezing the sap and discarding the ice multiple times) [[https://www.waldeneffect.org/blog/Is_it_safe_to_feed_maple_sap_to_bees__63__/|#]]. In any case of feeding maple sap to bees, it should be heated to 61.8c for a couple minutes and/or sterilized with addition of thyme and lemongrass essential oil before feeding it to bees because sap does contain live bad bacteria.%0a%0aMaple wine and vinegar [[https://practicalselfreliance.com/maple-sap-uses/|#]]%0a%0aMaple sugar sand aka niter is mostly calcium malate and also butter precipitates out in the sand (butter used to reduce foaming) [[https://zenodo.org/record/1429016|#]] [[https://web.archive.org/web/20230315224236/https://zenodo.org/record/1429016/files/article.pdf?download=1|#]] .

To me this means taking melatonin can train pathogenic bacteria to degrade it causing cancer. However taking [[lactobacillus]] like [[l reuteri]] with [[inulin]] and [[melatonin]] can reduce breast cancer risk. Melatonin degradation by some pathogenic bacteria (prpbably killed with [[lemongrass]]) produces estrogen causing breast cancer. Melatonin antagonist of [[calmodulin]] by blocking the estrogen-estrogen receptor-calmodulin complex from binding to DNA. Increase in breast cancer for women who wprk at night (reduced melatonin). Melatonin supresses estrogen as a [[SERM]]. Decreases apoptosis in immune cells like [[CD4]] [[CD8]] and neurons, and increases it in cancer cells. Inhibits telomerase. Reduces absorption of cancer promoting [[linoleic acid]]. Melatonin reduces [[LH]] and [[FSH]] reducing [[estrogen]] and [[prolactin]] and likely lowers excess [[testosterone]] in men. Melatonin inhibits [[aromatase]] and [[sulfatase]], sulfatase unsulfates sulfur bound estrogens. [[Inflammation]] of white fat leads to aromatase. [[Insulin]] reduces [[SHBG]] increasing free estrogen. Low adiponectin and high leptin from insulin resistance contributes to cancer. Tumor fat tissue high in [[aromatase]]. [[PGE2]] stimulates [[aromatase]] via [[COX]]. Melatonin decreases pge2 and cox and [[cAMP]]. Bacteria containing beta [[glucuronidase]] may be what causes the cancer. Breast cancer patients presented a greater abundance of [[firmicutes]], [[Clostridium]], [[Ruminococcus]], [[Faecalibacterium]], [[E coli]] and [[Shigella]]. Firmicutes enhanced in obesity and disrupted sleep. [[Butyrate]] a [[SCFA]] is anti cancer perhaps via [[IL10]]. Saturated fats enhance [[COX2]]. [[IL6]] excess leads to cancer progression. Some lactobacillus like l helveticus raises [[IL10]] and lowers [[IL6]]. [[Insomnia]] related to elevated inflamatory bacteria like [[ruminococcus]] and reduced [[lactobacillus]]. Melatonin reduces [[clostridium]] and increases lactobacillus. [[Vitamin D]] regulates gut permeability like [[leaky gut]] and therefore gut motility and so [[diarrhea]] and [[constipation]] allowing LPS to activate the pathogen recognition system CD14/TLR2/4/MD2. The activation of this complex activates NFkβ, activating the inflammatory cytokines, TNFα, IL-1β, IL-6, COX2, and NO, and triggering strong autoimmune inflammatory activity that will eventually metastasize. Melatonin inhibits [[SERT]] which means in people high in [[serotonin]] it might not help insomnia. Elevated [[LPS]] from gram negative bacteria ([[herxheimer]]) inhibits melatonin production. Butyrate improves intestinal barrier therefore helps [[leaky gut]]. Melatonin counteracts estrogenic [[toxin]]s including [[cadmium]].

Can be done under acidic or neutral conditions. Natural organic acids can be added to darken and assist hydrolysis of sucrose into glucose and fructose but not required. Some or all remaining crystalizable sugar can be removed but not required. Any brix maple sap with water removed that is concentrated to any degree or completely while temperature always remaining at or below 61.8c (via crystallization or separation [like reverse osmosis] or more likely boiling under vacuum or evaporating at low heat) may be called maple syrum. Very light maple molasses that has low vannila flavor (produced between 61.8c to 79.5c) can be called maple hunny.

To me this means taking melatonin can train pathogenic bacteria to degrade it causing cancer. However taking [[lactobacillus]] like [[l reuteri]] with [[inulin]] and [[melatonin]] can reduce breast cancer risk. Melatonin degradation by some pathogenic bacteria (prpbably killed with [[lemongrass]]) produces estrogen causing breast cancer. Melatonin antagonist of [[calmodulin]] by blocking the estrogen-estrogen receptor-calmodulin complex from binding to DNA. Increase in breast cancer for women who wprk at night (reduced melatonin). Melatonin supresses estrogen as a [[SERM]]. Decreases apoptosis in immune cells like [[CD4]] [[CD8]] and neurons, and increases it in cancer cells. Inhibits telomerase. Reduces absorption of cancer promoting [[linoleic acid]]. Melatonin reduces [[LH]] and [[FSH]] reducing [[estrogen]] and [[prolactin]] and likely lowers excess [[testosterone]] in men. Melatonin inhibits [[aromatase]] and [[sulfatase]], sulfatase unsulfates sulfur bound estrogens. [[Inflammation]] of white fat leads to aromatase. [[Insulin]] reduces [[SHBG]] increasing free estrogen. Low adiponectin and high leptin from insulin resistance contributes to cancer. Tumor fat tissue high in [[aromatase]]. [[PGE2]] stimulates [[aromatase]] via [[COX]]. Melatonin decreases pge2 and cox and [[cAMP]]. Bacteria containing beta [[glucuronidase]] may be what causes the cancer. Breast cancer patients presented a greater abundance of [[firmicutes]], [[Clostridium]], [[Ruminococcus]], [[Faecalibacterium]], [[E coli]] and [[Shigella]]. Firmicutes enhanced in obesity and disrupted sleep. [[Butyrate]] a [[SCFA]] is anti cancer perhaps via [[IL10]]. Saturated fats enhance [[COX2]]. [[IL6]] excess leads to cancer progression. Some lactobacillus like l helveticus raises [[IL10]] and lowers [[IL6]]. [[Insomnia]] related to elevated inflamatory bacteria like [[ruminococcus]] and reduced [[lactobacillus]]. Melatonin reduces [[clostridium]] and increases lactobacillus. [[Vitamin D]] regulates gut permeability like [[leaky gut]] and therefore gut motility and so [[diarrhea]] and [[constipation]] allowing LPS to activate the pathogen recognition system CD14/TLR2/4/MD2. The activation of this complex activates NFkβ, activating the inflammatory cytokines, TNFα, IL-1β, IL-6, COX2, and NO, and triggering strong autoimmune inflammatory activity that will eventually metastasize. Melatonin inhibits [[SERT]] which means in people high in [[serotonin]] it might not help insomnia. Elevated [[LPS]] from gram negative bacteria ([[herxheimer]]) inhibits melatonin production. Butyrate improves intestinal barrier therefore helps [[leaky gut]]. Melatonin counteracts estrogenic [[toxin]]s including [[cadmium]].

Actually water, salt, ash, and [[hydrogen peroxide]] may help, and be a single step process.%0a%3c %0a%3c Copal treated in an autoclave can be used for jewlry [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copal|#]] which to me means it causes polymerization (from high temp, pressure, and steam). So heat over long periods can probably produce amber but it can be detected and is classified as reconstituted amber since it produces smaller crystalline grains. This heat treated copal is resistant to acetone wheras normal copal is not. Copal is good ingredient for wood varnish. Subfossil copal produces harder varnish.%0a%3c %0a%3c putting copal in the sun may be another way to produce amber by polymerization.%0a%3c %0a%3c Amber can also be used in varnish [[http://www.wetcanvas.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1422562|#]] [[https://natural-baltic-amber.com/amber-varnish/|#]] [[https://www.oldwood1700.com/en/product/classical-amber-varnish/|#]] made from amber powder and polymerized [[linseed oil]], which linseed oil can be polymerized in the sun via UV. Can be diluted with [[turpentine]]. Finished amber varnish after application to object can be improved in a UV chamber, which means putting copal in the sun may be another way to produce amber. Copal dissolves in turpentine wheras amber does not [[https://www.wetcanvas.com/forums/topic/amber-varnish-making-it/#post-1266361|#]]. Dissolvimg amber is possible however and is a trade secret [[https://www.wetcanvas.com/forums/topic/amber-varnish-making-it/page/2/#post-1266371|#]] and probably is special dangerous solvent heated. Actually amber is heated with linseed oil or walnut oil to dissolve it [[https://www.wetcanvas.com/forums/topic/amber-varnish-making-it/#post-1266360|#]] probably the linseed oil that has sat in the sun and then fully polymerized linseed oil added after amber has dissolved along with turpentine. The resultant may be black [[https://www.wetcanvas.com/forums/topic/amber-varnish-making-it/#post-1266362|#]] and probably clarified with [[activated clay]] [[clay]]. Needs raw linseed oil to dissolve amber, needs to be heated slowly to boiling, also acids dissolve amber [[https://www.wetcanvas.com/forums/topic/amber-varnish-making-it/#post-1266363|#]] to remove acid from acid dissolved amber (probably amber powder dissolved in concentrated [[phosphoric acid]]) probably similar to making regenerated cellulose from microcrystalline cellulose dissolved in phosphoric acid then stirred in water and centrifuged and repeated to remove the acid. In other words washing. Amber varnish is very dark and used in elite wood furniture varnish [[https://www.wetcanvas.com/forums/topic/amber-varnish-making-it/page/2/#post-1266374|#]]. So powdered amber is needed to have a chance to dissolve it in heated oil. Also it can probably be done under inert atmosphere (no oxygen) to prevent burning and allow to be heated to higher temp. Also perhaps turpentine can be used if heated under inert high pressure conditions, required because heating turpentine in air will cause it to spontaneously combust!%0a%3c %0a%3c Alcohol or other solvent on copal will soften it, amber will not soften [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gum_copal|#]]%0a%3c %0a%3c Amber was produced by pinus succinifera [[https://www.gemstones.com/articles/gemstone-copal-vs-amber|#]] trees so obviously they were high in succinate. Or possibly the succinate is formed from alkaline chloride attack.%0a%3c %0a%3c Copal vs amber [[https://www.gemstones.com/articles/gemstone-copal-vs-amber|#]]%0a%3c %0a%3c Actually only baltic amber contains succinic acid 50-400ppm wheras other ambers do not [[https://analyticalsciencejournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/rcm.3886|#]] so it seems succinic acid is not necessary to produce amber from alkaline chlorode attack of copal (melted pine resin). So likely the alkaline chloride aging (fossilization) does not create succinate. Or it coupd be precisely that it was oxidized by chloride in the sea that produced the succinate...back to square one not sure whether succinate was produced by the tree or if it was produced from chloride attack on the copal. However it is good to know that even if we don't produce succinic acid that it can still become real amber by polymerization of melted pine resin (copal) likely due to alkaline chloride attack. However only baltic amber is jewlery grade [[https://www.getty.edu/publications/ambers/intro/5/|#]]%0a%3c %0a%3c Discerning real amber [[https://www.balticessentials.com/blogs/news/learn-to-spot-fake-amber|#]] matte not glossy shine. Copal melts rather than burns, if it melts its copal if it burns it is amber, easiest test is see if a hot needle can pierce it. Acetone (nail polish remover) or [[HCL]] muriatic acid will dissolve copal and not effect amber (at room temperature). Amber has a pale glow under UV light wheras copal does not. Hot needle test says that autoclaved copal is the same as amber. Also autoclaved copal passes the solvent test. Flouresence test should determine amber more fluorescent than autoclaved copal. FTIR is best method to differentiate autoclaved copal from amber [[https://www.gemstones.com/articles/gemstone-copal-vs-amber|#]] which I believe relies on the heating of the copal changing the peorpertues. Artificially aged cold methods like alkaline chloride attack (soaking copal in salt and wood ash water) shouldn't fail the FTIR test. The chloride attack oxidizes and probably helps removal of volatiles. Also succinate peak is needed for baltic amber. No copals have succinate it seems which to me means that most likely the succinate is formed from alkaline chloride attack, or it couod have been prehistoric trees really did just produce more succinic acid. Amber goes pliable at 200c (so a heated press is great to make cohesive amber). I personally think the succinate is produced from oxygen vacancies (think chloride and blue sulfide rich earth) which are not created in an autoclave, but it is also possible it was fromthe specific trees themselves and in that case should be added to create real baltic amber.%0a%3c %0a%3c Subfossil copal found 1-2 meters below living copal trees [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copal|#]] producing harder varnish than normal copal.%0a%3c %0a%3c Fuzzy white on insects from fungus probably and trichomes on plants not possible in autoclaved opal [[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Fly_in_amber,_Samland_Peninsula_along_the_Baltic_Sea_RU.jpg|#]] but probably possible on cold aged (alkaline chloride) copal%0a%3c %0a%3c Baltic amber in samland penninsula in blue earth layer [[https://www.getty.edu/publications/ambers/intro/5/|#]] interesting because to me blue earth means high in hydrogen sulfide which is reducing agent not oxidizing. But we know that sulfur radicals can also induce oxygen vacancies producing the same effect as alkaline chloride.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Things that cannot be shipped international like certain seeds [[https://www.myus.com/benefits/shipping/customs-help/restrictions/|#]] [[https://www.usglobalmail.com/prohibited-export-items-internationally/|#]]%0a%3c %0a%3c Look into beans [[favism]] [[blood clot]].

The final luster is given by polishing with flannel.%0a%3c When gradually heated in an oil bath, amber "becomes soft and flexible. Two pieces of amber may be united by smearing the surfaces with linseed oil, heating them, and then pressing them together while hot. Cloudy amber may be clarified in an oil bath, as the oil fills the numerous pores that cause the turbidity. Small fragments, formerly thrown away or used only for varnish are now used on a large scale in the formation of "ambroid" or "pressed amber".[30] The pieces are carefully heated with exclusion of air and then compressed into a uniform mass by intense hydraulic pressure, the softened amber being forced through holes in a metal plate. The product is extensively used for the production of cheap jewelry and articles for smoking. This pressed amber yields brilliant interference colors in polarized light." Amber has often been imitated by other resins like copal and kauri gum, as well as by celluloid and even glass. Baltic amber is sometimes colored artificially but also called "true amber".%0a%3c %0a%3c Composition of resin/rosin but not the weight difference [[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/304982587_Chemical_Compositions_of_Pine_Resin_Rosin_and_Turpentine_Oil_from_West_Java|#]] [[https://archive.ph/OiSeI|#]] also this article shows how to dissolve the acidic fraction (rosin) using diethyl ether and 4%25 NaOH which means a little ash and salt in water shouldn't dissolve it but rather polymerize it while oxidizing turpentine to create heat.%0a%3c %0a%3c Turpentine from distillation of pine resin [[https://www.quora.com/What-type-of-trees-yield-the-resin-used-to-produce-turpentine|#]]%0a%3c %0a%3c Off the bat we have to assume amber is produced by pine-like trees that create 8%25 dry weight succinic acid in sap. Succinic acid may be produced with fermentation of glucose/xyloglucan but since succinate producing trees are known we have to assume that might be the only way 8%25 succinic acid could get in the resin. So the production method would be add 8%25 succinic acid to pine resin (probably mre to get 8%25 by dry weight, so determine the rosin weight vs resin weight and add corresponding succinic acid so it is 8%25 of rosin weight. Then alkalize ideally by putting the resin/succinic acid mix glob in ash to harden and dry. Perhaps though oxidation of the resin with alkaline chloride would be enoigh to produce the succinate [[https://www.scienceforums.net/topic/2913-how-to-make-amber/?do=findComment&comment=41656|#]] wter may be needed and time and conditions for polymerization (oxygen may ruin?

Alkali (and potentially heat) should cause polymerization. However the alkaline chloride may also help polymerization, not sure. Since amber is found in the sea mostly, it shouldn't hurt to add the salt even if adding succinate makes it mostly pointless. Testing is required to figure this out. Try pine resin with and without added 6%25 succinic acid and add both to the ash/salt water mix and see which gets harder faster (and tougher).%0a%3c %0a%3c ------%0a%3c %0a%3c Pine sap uses salve pine sap, oil, beeswax.

Yes another comment says you melted itbutnot polymerized or oxidized it. Another comment says a slow cook plus [[UV]] light may polymerize it.

I started with many varieties from the USDA collection at Pullman, WA and from others obtained widely. By a certain manipulation in early flowering, some clones produced true seed, with sexual recombination. These were germinated through embryo rescue and new, virus-free garlics were created. These were selected for fertility, vigor and bulb and clove characters. Several generations of seed production were followed by clonal selection. The breeding and selection were carried out in Southwestern Oregon. So, now, year 2011, I have 29 different clones, put into 10 groups for release and sale for the very first time! These garlics appear to fit in the Rocambole group and they have a rich, well-rounded outstanding flavor. Their scapes become very tall and develop several loops. They are robust, vigorous and appear virus-free. Some have giant cloves, with few per bulb. Others have smaller, but more numerous cloves. All are hardnecks. They are identified by groups, A-J, and by numbers within each group. A photo of representative samples of each group can be seen on this site."%0a> %0a> Ted meridith guide to true garlic seed [[https://garlicseed.blogspot.com/p/growing-garlic-from-true-seed.html|#]]%0a

I started with many varieties from the USDA collection at Pullman, WA and from others obtained widely. By a certain manipulation in early flowering, some clones produced true seed, with sexual recombination. These were germinated through embryo rescue and new, virus-free garlics were created. These were selected for fertility, vigor and bulb and clove characters. Several generations of seed production were followed by clonal selection. The breeding and selection were carried out in Southwestern Oregon. So, now, year 2011, I have 29 different clones, put into 10 groups for release and sale for the very first time! These garlics appear to fit in the Rocambole group and they have a rich, well-rounded outstanding flavor. Their scapes become very tall and develop several loops. They are robust, vigorous and appear virus-free. Some have giant cloves, with few per bulb. Others have smaller, but more numerous cloves. All are hardnecks. They are identified by groups, A-J, and by numbers within each group. A photo of representative samples of each group can be seen on this site."%0a%3c %0a%3c Ted meridith guide to true garlic seed [[https://garlicseed.blogspot.com/p/growing-garlic-from-true-seed.html|#]]%0a%3c %0a%3c Reasonable take on downsides of bitcoin [[https://theblockstalk.medium.com/the-biggest-problems-of-bitcoin-that-people-are-not-speaking-about-8ce2493e9609|#]]%0a
