Also had [[pseudomonas]] treated with acetylsalicylic acid at 100 mg once daily for secondary stroke prevention, folic acid at 5 mg once daily, hydroxocobalamin IM once/month. Mycoplasma caused delerious sexual fantasies so might be one responsible agent for sexual fantasies or sexual addiction. Patient also couldn't look up after partial recovery which I had trouble doing after treatment with essential oils for thalamus infarct, probably causes [[strabisimus]]. Patient had acute issues after living with elderly. For me it seems like the infarct is from a biofilm in the nervous system that spans from the spinal cord in the neck and the back and sides of neck through the brain and meninges to the soft spot in the skull to the eyes and eye sockets amd nasopharanx all the way down to the heart, probably even the kidneys and wrists. What bacteria (pseudomonas?) or mycoplasma could be causing the biofilm? Putting the treatment essential oils on scalp and forehead.

Mycoplasma caused delerious sexual fantasies so might be one responsible agent for sexual fantasies or sexual addiction. Patient also couldn't look up after partial recovery which I had trouble doing after treatment with essential oils for thalamus infarct, probably causes [[strabisimus]]. Patient had acute issues after living with elderly. For me it seems like the infarct is from a biofilm in the nervous system that spans from the spinal cord in the neck and the back and sides of neck through the brain and meninges to the soft spot in the skull to the eyes and eye sockets amd nasopharanx all the way down to the heart, probably even the kidneys and wrists. What bacteria (pseudomonas?) or mycoplasma could be causing the biofilm? Putting the treatment essential oils on scalp and forehead.
