Not sure though if that is sufficient to produce succinate or if it had to be special pine resin.  It is possible that the free radical oxidation by alkaline produces succinic acid and also polymerizes it from the alkali or long time periods.

Also had [[pseudomonas]] treated with acetylsalicylic acid at 100 mg once daily for secondary stroke prevention, folic acid at 5 mg once daily, hydroxocobalamin IM once/month. Mycoplasma caused delerious sexual fantasies so might be one responsible agent for sexual fantasies or sexual addiction. Patient also couldn't look up after partial recovery which I had trouble doing after treatment with essential oils for thalamus infarct, probably causes [[strabisimus]]. Patient had acute issues after living with elderly. For me it seems like the infarct is from a biofilm in the nervous system that spans from the spinal cord in the neck and the back and sides of neck through the brain and meninges to the soft spot in the skull to the eyes and eye sockets amd nasopharanx all the way down to the heart, probably even the kidneys and wrists. What bacteria (pseudomonas?) or mycoplasma could be causing the biofilm? Putting the treatment essential oils on scalp and forehead.

This is why "moist" is a popular word right now because we are bieng bombarded with dryness. I bet vinyl chloride or byproducts from burning will cause dryness. Also we know clearly from experience thqt [[GMO]] corn causes severe drying of the face. Also that drug that causes facial aging. Also of course likely [[spike protein]] causes dehydration dryness as well as fibrin clot growth. Also the GMO corn caused clots too so perhaps the aliens are primarily learning how tp clot the mucus cells to prevent them from producing mucus. Also takimg tsp magnesium oxide with 1 tsp activated charcoal and 1 tbsp synthetic lemon luice caused some dryness, probably from dehydration and possibly low potassium or calcium. From teef powder we know certain bacteria killed by [[garlic]] possibly [[mycobacterium]] or [[corynebacterium]] causes dry mouth, so garlic certainly can imporve mucus membrane moisture.

I started with many varieties from the USDA collection at Pullman, WA and from others obtained widely. By a certain manipulation in early flowering, some clones produced true seed, with sexual recombination. These were germinated through embryo rescue and new, virus-free garlics were created. These were selected for fertility, vigor and bulb and clove characters. Several generations of seed production were followed by clonal selection. The breeding and selection were carried out in Southwestern Oregon. So, now, year 2011, I have 29 different clones, put into 10 groups for release and sale for the very first time! These garlics appear to fit in the Rocambole group and they have a rich, well-rounded outstanding flavor. Their scapes become very tall and develop several loops. They are robust, vigorous and appear virus-free. Some have giant cloves, with few per bulb. Others have smaller, but more numerous cloves. All are hardnecks. They are identified by groups, A-J, and by numbers within each group. A photo of representative samples of each group can be seen on this site."%0a> %0a> Ted meridith guide to true garlic seed [[https://garlicseed.blogspot.com/p/growing-garlic-from-true-seed.html|#]]%0a

I started with many varieties from the USDA collection at Pullman, WA and from others obtained widely. By a certain manipulation in early flowering, some clones produced true seed, with sexual recombination. These were germinated through embryo rescue and new, virus-free garlics were created. These were selected for fertility, vigor and bulb and clove characters. Several generations of seed production were followed by clonal selection. The breeding and selection were carried out in Southwestern Oregon. So, now, year 2011, I have 29 different clones, put into 10 groups for release and sale for the very first time! These garlics appear to fit in the Rocambole group and they have a rich, well-rounded outstanding flavor. Their scapes become very tall and develop several loops. They are robust, vigorous and appear virus-free. Some have giant cloves, with few per bulb. Others have smaller, but more numerous cloves. All are hardnecks. They are identified by groups, A-J, and by numbers within each group. A photo of representative samples of each group can be seen on this site."%0a%3c %0a%3c Ted meridith guide to true garlic seed [[https://garlicseed.blogspot.com/p/growing-garlic-from-true-seed.html|#]]%0a%3c %0a%3c Reasonable take on downsides of bitcoin [[https://theblockstalk.medium.com/the-biggest-problems-of-bitcoin-that-people-are-not-speaking-about-8ce2493e9609|#]]%0a
