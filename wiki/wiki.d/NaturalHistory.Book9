text=THE   NINTH  BOOK %0a%0a%0aHISTORY    OF    NATURE %0a%0a%0aC.   PLINIUS   SECUNDUS. %0a%0a%0aCHAPTER  I. %0aOf  the  Nature  of  the  Inhabitants  of  the  Water. %0a%0ahave  pointed  out  the  Nature  of  those  Ani- %0ama^s  which  are  caHed  Terrestrial,  and  which %0ahave  some  Society  with  Men.  And  consi- %0adering  that  among  the  others  they  that  fly %0aK2OOOO*  are  the  least,  we  will  first  treat  of  the  Inha- %0abitants of  the  Sea ;  and  of  those  also  that  live  in  Rivers  or %0aPonds. %0a%0aCHAPTER  II. %0a%0aWhy  the  Sea  should  breed  the  greatest  living  Creatures. %0a%0aTHE  Waters  bring  forth  greater  Abundance  of  living %0aCreatures,  and  these  also  of  larger  size,  than  the  Land. %0aThe  Cause  is  evident,  in  the  excessive  Abundance  of  Mois- %0ature. For  the  Birds,  which  live  suspended  in  the  Air,  their %0aCase  is  otherwise.  But  in  the  Sea,  which  is  so  widely %0aspread  abroad,  so  soft  and  proper  to  yield  Nourishment %0aand  increase,  and  receiveth  the  Causes  of  Propagation  from %0a%0a%0aBOOK  IX.]  History  of  Nature.  107 %0a%0aon  high,  Nature  is  always  framing  some  new  Creatures, %0amany  of  which  are  found  to  be  monstrous  Things.  For %0athe  Seeds  and  universal  Elements  are  so  interlaced  and %0ainingled  one  with  another,  partly  by  the  blowing  (of  the %0aWinds),  and  at  other  Times  by  the  Agitation  (of  the  Waves), %0athat  it  may  truly  be  said,  according  to  the  vulgar  Opinion, %0athat  whatever  is  bred  in  any  Part  of  Nature  is  to  be  found %0aalso  in  the  Sea  ;  and  many  more  Things  besides,  which  no- %0awhere else  are  to  be  seen.  For  there  truly  not  only  exist  the %0aForms  of  Land  Animals,  but  also  of  many  other  Things;  and %0athere  may  one  see  also  what  appear  like  Bunches  of  Grapes, %0aSwords,  and  Saws;  yea,  and  also  Cucumbers,  which  for %0aColour,  Smell,  and  Taste,  resemble  those  that  grow  on %0athe  Land.  And  therefore  we  need  the  less  to  wonder,  if  in %0asuch  little  Snails  there  are  some  Things  standing  out  like %0athe  Heads  of  Horses. %0a%0aCHAPTER  III. %0aOf  Beasts  in  the  Indian  Sea. %0a%0aTHE  Indian  Sea  breedeth  the  most  and  biggest  Animals ; %0aamong  which  Whales  (Balaenae)1  are  as  large  as  four  Acres  of %0aLand  ;  and  Pristes  two  hundred  Cubits:  and  no  Wonder,  for %0a%0a1  To  avoid  a  confusion  of  references,  the  species  of  whales  mentioned %0aby  Pliny  are  here  arranged  at  one  view ;  and,  so  far  as  the  subject  admits, %0aidentified  with  those  recognised  by  modern  naturalists. %0a%0aThe  term  "  Balaenae  "  appears,  in  its  widest  extension,  to  have  been  a %0ageneral  name  for  the  whole  tribe ;  in  which  also  were  comprised  some %0ainhabitants  of  the  ocean,  of  large  size,  which  had  nothing  in  common %0awith  the  proper  whales  but  their  magnitude.  The  Pristis,  perhaps  the %0aBasking  Shark  (Selachus  maximus,  Cuv.),  and  some  other  species,  and %0acertainly  the  Tunny,  when,  as  sometimes  happens,  it  has  attained  enor- %0amous growth,  were  anciently  arranged  among  cetaceous  fishes.  But  be- %0asides this,  the  word  "  Balaena,"  or  "  Phalsena,"  was  the  proper  name  of %0athe  animal  known  as  the  Balcenoptera  musculus,  or  the  Rorqual  of %0aCuvier;  which  they  did  not  distinguish  from  B.  Boops. %0a%0aThe  creatures  referred  to  at  the  end  of  Ch.  3,  and  compared  to  horses, %0aasses,  and  bulls,  were  probably  Dugongs,  or  Sea-cows ;  the  Manatus  and %0aHalichore  of  Cuvier,  and  comprised  in  the  genus  Trichecus  of  Linncus. %0aPhyseter,  a  modern  as  well  as  ancient  genus  of  whales,  is  still  known  on %0a%0a%0a1 08  History  of  Nature.  [BoOK  1 X . %0a%0aLocusts  are  there  to  be  found  of  full  four  Cubits  :  and  Eels %0ain  the  River  Ganges  of  thirty  Feet.  But  these  Beasts  in  the %0aSea  are  chiefly  to  be  seen  about  the  Solstice.  For  then  by %0athe  Whirlwinds,  Rains,  and  Tempests,  which  rush  with  Vio- %0alence down  from  the  rugged  Mountains,  the  Seas  are  turned %0aup  from  the  very  Bottom  ;  and  thus  the  Billows  roll  and %0araise  these  Beasts  out  of  the  deep  Parts  of  the  Ocean.  For %0ain  that  Manner  so  great  a  Multitude  of  Tunnies  were  on  one %0aoccasion  driven  up,  that  the  Fleet  of  Alexander  the  Great  was %0aable  to  make  head  against  them  in  no  other  Manner  than  by %0aadvancing  as  if  to  contend  with  an  Host  of  Enemies ;  for %0aotherwise  if  they  had  sailed  singly  and  asunder,  there  had %0abeen  no  Way  to  escape.  By  no  Voice,  no  Noise,  no  Blows, %0abut  by  the  Crash  only  were  they  terrified  ;  nor  are  they %0adisturbed  but  by  Destruction. %0a%0aIn  the  Red  Sea  there  is  a  great  Peninsula  named  Cadara, %0aprojecting  so  far  as  to  form  an  extensive  Bay,  which  it  took %0aKing  Ptolemceus  twelve  Days  and  Nights  to  row  through ; %0afor  there  was  not  any  Wind  to  help  him.  Through  the %0aStillness  of  this  Place,  the  Beasts  grow  to  such  bigness, %0athat  their  Weight  renders  them  not  able  to  stir.  The  Com- %0amanders of  the  Fleets  of  Alexander  the  Great  reported, %0athat  the  Gedrosi,  a  People  dwelling  on  the  River  Arbis, %0a%0athe  west  coasts  of  Britain,  by  the  corresponding  term  "  Blower."  The %0aenormous  creature  cast  on  shore  at  Gades,  as  mentioned  at  the  end  of %0aChap.  5,  must  have  been  of  this  genus ;  and  as  the  number  of  teeth %0aassigned  to  it  was  probably  counted  collectively,  after  the  jaws  were %0adenuded  of  flesh,  when  some  also  are  seen  in  the  upper  jaw,  it  may  be %0asupposed  probable  that  it  was  Ph.  macrocephalus. %0a%0aThe  other  species  mentioned  by  Pliny  belong  to  the  genus  Delphinus  : — %0aD.  Orca.     The  Grampus.  —  It  is  also  the  Aries  or  Ram  of  Pliny  ; %0afrom  a  white  crescent  over  the  eye,  marked  on  the  skin,  fancifully %0asupposed  to  resemble  a  ram's  horn. %0aD.

There  are  others  also  which  have  Heads  like %0aHorses,  Asses,  and  Bulls ;  and  these  eat  the  standing  Corn. %0a%0aCHAPTER  IV. %0aWhich  are  the  greatest  Creatures  in  any  Ocean. %0a%0aTHE  largest  Creature  in  the  Indian  Sea  is  the  Pristis  and %0aBalsena  (Whale).  In  the  Ocean  of  Gaul  the  largest  is  the %0aPhyseter,  which  lifteth  itself  up  in  the  Manner  of  an  immense %0aPillar,  higher  than  the  Sails  of  Ships ;  and  spouteth  forth %0aalmost  a  Flood.  In  the  Ocean  of  Gades  there  is  a  Tree1 %0aspreading  abroad  with  mighty  Arms,  to  such  an  extent  that  it %0ais  believed  to  be  the  Cause  why  that  Arm  of  the  Sea  is  never %0aentered.  There  are  to  be  seen  also  what  from  their  Shape %0aare  called  Wheels,  distinguished  by  four  Rays  ;  with  their %0atwo  Eyes  closing  over  the  Naves  on  each  Side. %0a%0aCHAPTER  V. %0a%0aOf  the  Forms  of  Tritons,  Nereids,  and  Sea- Elephants  * %0aWHEN  Tiberius  was  Sovereign,  an  Embassy  of  the  Inha- %0a%0a1  This  and  the  wheel  may  be  referred  to  some  large  species  of  coral, %0aand  asterias,  or  sea-star ;  which  report  had  magnified  enormously.     But %0athe  former  is  thought  by  Dr.  Hamilton  to  be  the  Kraken  of  Pontop- %0apidan  :  perhaps  a  species  of  Medusa,  or  Cuttle-fish,  of  which  a  wonderful %0afigure  is  given  by  Denys  Montford,  where  one  of  these  creatures  is  seen %0acapturing  a  Chinese  junk.  —  Wern.  Club- %0a%0a2  Of  the  existence  of  these  beings,  as  they  are  represented  by  the %0apoets,  the  people  of  that  day  had  as  little  doubt  as  of  the  god  whose %0aattendants  they  were  supposed  to  be.     The  stories  told  in  this  chapter %0awere  probably  due  to  some  deception  practised  on  the  credulity  or  fear  of %0athe  neighbourhood  by  some  skilful  swimmers.

And  it  is  not %0afalse  that  there  is  such  a  Creature  as  a  Nereid;  only  their %0aBody  is  rough  with  Scales,  even  in  those  Parts  where  they %0apossess  the  human  Form.  For  such  a  Female  Being  was %0abeheld  on  the  same  Shore  ;  and  the  neighbouring  Inha- %0abitants heard  its  Moaning  from  a  Distance  when  it  was %0adying.  Also,  a  Governor  of  Gaul,  under  .Divus  Augustus, %0awrote,  that  many  of  these  Nereids  were  seen  dead  upon  the %0aShore.  I  possess  Authors,  illustrious  in  the  Equestrian %0aOrder,  who  testify  that  in  the  Ocean  near  Gades  they  saw  a %0aSea-man,  in  the  whole  Body  perfectly  resembling  a  Man  : %0athat  in  the  Night  Season  he  would  come  aboard  their  Boats; %0aand  on  whatever  Part  he  sat,  he  weighed  it  down  ;  so  that  if %0ahe  continued  there  any  long  Time  he  would  even  sink  it. %0aWhen  Tiberius  was  Sovereign,  in  an  Island  opposite  the %0aCoast  of  the  Province  of  Lugdunensis,  the  Sea,  when  it %0aebbed,  left  upon  the  Sands,  at  one  Time,  above  three  hun- %0adred Beasts,  of  a  wonderful  Variety  and  Bigness.  And %0athere  were  no  fewer  found  upon  the  Coast  of  the  Santones. %0aAnd  among  the  Rest  there  were  Elephants  and  Rams,  with %0aHorns  like  those  (of  the  Land),  except  that  they  were %0awhite:  and  many  Nereids  also.  Turanius  hath  reported, %0athat  a  Beast  was  cast  upon  the  Shore  at  Gades,  of  which  the %0aBreadth  of  the  two  Fins  forming  the  Ends  of  the  Tail  was %0asixteen  Cubits  ;  it  had  120  Teeth,  of  which  the  biggest %0awere  nine  Inches  in  Measure,  and  the  least  half  a  Foot. %0aM.  Scaurus,  among  other  wonderful  Things  in  his %0a%0a%0a(Phoca)  has  been  seen,  so  closely  resembling  the  human  figure  as  to  ob- %0atain the  name  of  Merman,  has,  even  in  modern  times,  been  confidently %0aasserted.  But  the  evidence  has  failed  in  proportion  to  the  progress  of %0ainquiry  ;  and  the  opinion  of  naturalists  of  the  present  age  appears  to  be, %0athat  the  casual  and  hasty  appearance  of  the  young  of  the  Walrus,  before %0ait  has  obtained  its  tusks,  has  been  the  cause  of  this  mistaken  idea.  The %0asame  creature,  in  its  adult  growth,  was,  beyond  doubt,  the  sea-elephant  of %0athe  ancients.  —  Wern.  Club. %0a%0a1  The  modern  Lisbon.  —Wern.

They  say  that %0ain  the  Ocean  about  Gades,  they  are  not  seen  before  Mid- %0awinter ;  for  at  their  set  Times  they  lie  close  in  a  certain  calm %0aand  large  Bay,  where  they  wonderfully  delight  to  show %0athemselves.  The  Orcae  know  this ;  they  are  a  Beast  that %0aare  a  deadly  Enemy  to  the  others ;  and  their  Likeness  can- %0anot be  represented  by  any  other  Figure  than  that  of  a %0amighty  Lump  of  Flesh,  armed  with  terrible  Teeth.  These %0abreak  into  those  secret  Retreats,  and  bite  and  tear  the  young %0aCalves,  or  those  newly  born,  with  the  old  ones  that  are %0agreat  with  Young;  they  also  pierce  into  them,  like  Ships  of %0aWar  attacking  with  their  Prows.  The  Balaenge  (Whales) %0athat  cannot  turn  aside,  and  are  helpless  to  resist,  being %0aunwieldy  by  reason  of  their  own  Weight,  being  then  heavy %0awith  Young,  or  weak  with  the  Pains  of  Parturition,  know %0ano  other  Means  of  Safety  but  to  escape  into  the  Deep,  and %0aso  defend  themselves  by  the  Aid  of  the  whole  Ocean.  On %0athe  other  Side,  the  Orcae  endeavour  to  lie  between  them  and %0athe  Way  of  Escape,  and  kill  them  among  the  Straits  and %0aragged  Rocks,  to  drive  them  upon  the  Shallows,  or  force %0athem  upon  the  Stones.

When  it  became  an  object  of  political %0aimportance  to  occupy  and  amuse  the  public  attention  by  subjects  alien  to %0athe  affairs  of  government,  every  thing  which  could  minister  to  the  curio- %0asity of  the  people  was  sought  for  in  the  wide  range  of  the  Roman  empire, %0aand  brought  to  the  city ;  where  the  credulity  of  the  populace  was  equal %0ato  its  ignorance.  The  supposed  relics  of  this  monster  may  have  been  the %0afossil  bones  of  some  gigantic  animal :  or  perhaps  nothing  more  than  the %0abones  of  a  whale.  —  Wern.

[BooK  IX. %0a%0aSea  appeareth  as  if  it  were  angry  with  itself;  for  although %0athere  are  no  Winds  in  the  Bay,  yet  the  Waves  are  so  great %0afrom  their  panting,  and  the  Blows,  as  no  Whirlwinds  are  able %0ato  raise.  In  the  Harbour  of  Ostia,  also,  one  of  these  Orcae  was %0aseen,  and  was  assailed  by  Claudius  the  Prince.  It  had  come %0awhen  he  was  making  the  Harbour,  enticed  by  the  Shipwreck %0aof  Beasts'  Hides  that  were  brought  from  Gaul,  on  which  for %0aseveral  Days  the  Creature  had  been  glutting  itself;  and  so %0ait  had  made  a  Channel  in  the  Bottom  of  the  Shallows,  which %0awas  so  narrowed  in  by  the  Action  of  the  Waves,  that  it  be- %0acame too  narrow  for  the  Creature  to  turn  round  ;  but  while %0ait  still  goeth  after  this  Gluttony,  being  thrown  by  the  Bil- %0alows upon  the  Shore,  its  back  appeared  high  above  the %0aWater,  like  the  Bottom  of  a  Ship  turned  upside  down. %0aCcesar  commanded  Nets  and  Cords  with  many  Folds  to  be %0aspread  along  the  Mouth  of  the  Harbour,  and  himself,  accom- %0apanied with  the  Prsetorian  Cohorts,  exhibited  it  for  a  Show  to %0athe  People  of  Rome;  the  Soldiers  being  brought  together, %0adarted  their  Spears  from  the  Ships,  one  of  which  I  myself %0asaw  sunk,  as  it  became  filled  with  the  Waves  that  this  Beast %0aspouted  up.  Balsenae  have  Openings  in  their  Forehead  ;  and %0aso  as  they  swim  on  the  Surface  of  the  Water,  they  blow  up %0aaloft  Showers  of  Rain. %0a%0aCHAPTER  VII. %0aWhether  or  no  Fish  breathe  or  sleep. %0a%0aALL  Writers  allow  that  a  very  few  other  Fishes  in  the %0aSea,  which  among  other  inward  Bowels  have  a  Lung, %0abreathe ;  for  without  the  latter  Organ  no  Animal  is  thought %0ato  draw  breath*  And  they  who  are  of  this  Opinion  suppose, %0alikewise,  that  no  Fishes  having  Gills  draw  in  and  return %0atheir  Breath  by  turns  ;  nor  many  other  Kinds  besides,  al- %0athough they  are  without  Gills  :  of  which  Opinion,  I  see,  was %0aAristotle;  and  he  supported  the  Doctrine  by  many  profound %0aResearches.  But  I  must  not  conceal  that  1  do  not  entirely  agree %0awith  this  Opinion ;  for,  if  Nature  be  so  disposed,  other  internal %0aOrgans  are  able  to  carry  on  the  Function  of  Breathing  in %0a%0a%0aBOOK  IX.]  History  of  Nature.  1 13 %0a%0athe  Place  of  Lungs,  just  as  in  many  Creatures  another  Kind %0aof  Humour  is  in  the  Place  of  Blood.  And  who  would  wonder %0athat  this  vital  Breath  should  penetrate  within  the  Waters, %0aconsidering  that  he  seeth  how  it  is  returned  from  them ;  and %0athat  it  penetrateth  even  into  the  Earth,  which  is  the  grossest %0aPart  of  Nature,  we  perceive  by  the  Example  of  the  Crea- %0atures, as  the  Moles,  which  live,  although  always  buried  in %0athe  Ground.  I  have  effectual  Reasons  to  lead  me  to  believe, %0athat  all  Things  in  the  Waters  breathe,  each  one  after  its %0aNature.  First,  I  have  often  observed  in  Fishes  an  evident %0aAction  of  breathing  in  the  Heat  of  Summer;  and  also  that %0athey  gape  when  the  Weather  is  calm ;  and  they  also  who %0abelieve  the  contrary,  confess  that  Fishes  sleep.1  For  what %0aPlace  is  there  for  Sleep  without  Breathing  ?  Moreover, %0awhence  those  Bubbles  which  are  breathed  from  under %0aWater?  and  the  increase  of  the  Bodies  of  Shell-fishes  by  the %0aInfluence  the  Moon  ?  But  above  all,  Fishes  possess  the %0apower  of  Hearing  and  Smelling,2  and  no  doubt  both  these %0aSenses  are  from  the  Matter  of  Air  :  for  it  can  be  understood %0athat  Smell  is  nothing  but  the  Air  infected.  However,  let %0aevery  one  think  as  he  pleases  on  these  Points.  Neither %0aWhales,  called  Balaense,  nor  Dolphins,  have  any  Gills.  Both %0athese  Kinds  breathe  through  Passages  which  reach  down  to %0athe  Lungs:  from  the  Forehead  in  the  Balsens,  and  in  the %0aDolphins,  from  the  Back.  Also  the  Sea-calves,  which  they %0acall  Phoca:,  breathe  and  sleep  on  the  Land.  So  do  Tortoises, %0aof  which  more  by  and  by. %0a%0aCHAPTER  VII f. %0aOf  Dolphins. %0a%0aTHE  swiftest  of  all  living  Creatures,  not  of  the  Sea  only, %0ais  the  Dolphin  ;  more  rapid  than  a  Bird,  swifter  than  an %0aArrow  ;  and  but  that  its  Mouth  is  far  beneath  its  Snout, %0a(being  almost  in  the  middle  of  its  Belly),  not  a  Fish  could %0aescape  from  its  rapid  Pursuit.

[BooK  IX. %0a%0ahath  afforded  an  Hinderance  ;  for  unless  they  turn  upright %0aupon  their  Back,  they  cannot  lay  hold  ;  from  whence  chiefly %0aappeareth  their  Swiftness.  For  when  the  Dolphins  are %0aurged  by  Hunger  to  pursue  a  Fish  that  flies  before  them %0adown  to  the  very  Bottom,  and  hold  their  Breath  for  a  long %0aTime,  to  take  Breath  again  they  dart  aloft  as  if  they  were %0ashot  out  of  a  Bow;  and  with  such  Force  do  they  spring  up, %0athat  many  Times  they  pass  over  the  Sails  of  Ships.  They %0aact  almost  as  if  they  were  united  in  Marriage.  They  pro- %0aduce their  young  ones  in  the  tenth  Month,  in  the  Summer- %0atime ;  and  sometimes  they  have  two  at  once.  They  suckle %0athem  at  their  Teats,  as  the  (Whales)  Balaens  do ;  and  so %0along  as  their  little  ones  are  feeble  from  Youth,  they  carry  them %0aabout ;  so  that  even  when  they  are  become  of  full  size  they  bear %0athem  Company  through  their  great  Affection  to  their  Young. %0aYoung  Dolphins  come  very  speedily  to  their  Growth;  for  in %0aten  Years  they  are  thought  to  have  come  to  their  full  Big- %0aness ;  but  they  live  thirty  Years,  as  hath  been  known  by  the %0aTrial  of  cutting  a  Mark  in  their  Tail.  They  lie  close  for  the %0aSpace  of  thirty  Days,  about  the  Rising  of  the  Dog-star;  con- %0acealing themselves  in  some  unknown  Manner,  which  is  the %0amore  wonderful  if  they  cannot  breathe  under  Water.  They %0aare  accustomed  to  spring  forth  to  the  Land  from  some  un- %0acertain Cause  ;  and  as  soon  as  they  touch  the  dry  Ground %0athey  die :  and  so  much  the  sooner  because  their  Pipe  is %0aclosed.  Their  Tongue  is  movable,  contrary  to  the  Nature  of %0aother  Creatures  living  in  the  Waters  ;  it  is  also  short  and %0abroad,  not  much  unlike  that  of  a  Swine.  Their  Voice  resem- %0ableth  the  Moaning  of  a  Man  ;  they  are  Saddle-backed,  and %0athe  Snout  is  flat.  And  this  is  the  Cause  that  all  of  them,  in %0aa  wonderful  Manner,  acknowledge  the  Name  Simo,  and  like %0ato  be  so  called.  The  Dolphin  is  not  only  a  friendly  Creature %0ato  Man,  but  also  to  the  Art  of  Music:  it  is  delighted  with %0aHarmony  in  Song,  but  especially  with  the  Sound  of  the %0aWater  Instrument.  Of  Man  it  is  not  afraid  as  of  a  Stranger; %0abut  meeteth  their  Ships,  playeth  as  if  in  Joy,  enters  into %0aCompetition,  and  out-goeth  them,  although  they  carry  full %0aSails. %0a%0a%0aBOOK  IX.]  History  of  Nature.  \  15 %0a%0aWhen  Divus  Augustus  was  Sovereign,  a  Dolphin  in  the %0aLake  Lucrinus  loved  with  wonderful  Affection  a  Boy  who %0awas  the  Son  of  a  poor  Man  ;  and  who,  using  to  go  every  Day %0ato  a  Grammar-School  from  Baianum  to  Puteoli,  was  accus- %0atomed about  Noon  to  loiter  and  call  the  Dolphin  by  the %0aName  of  Simo ;  and  many  Times  he  would  give  him  Frag- %0aments of  Bread,  which  for  that  Purpose  he  brought  with  him. %0aI  should  be  reluctant  to  relate  this,  but  that  Meccenas,  Fabi- %0aanus,  Flavins  Alfius,  and  many  others,  have  committed  the %0aMatter  to  Record.  At  whatever  Time  of  the  Day  this  Boy %0acalled  him,  however  hidden  and  concealed,  he  would  hasten %0afrom  his  Retreat ;  and  being  fed  from  his  Hand,  he  gently %0aoffered  him  his  Back  to  mount  upon,  lowering  down  the %0aSpines  of  his  Fins,  as  into  a  Sheath.  And  when  on  his  Back %0ahe  carried  him  over  the  broad  Sea  as  far  as  Puteoli  to %0aSchool ;  in  the  same  Manner  conveying  him  back  again  for %0amany  Years.  But  when  the  Boy  fell  sick  and  died,  the %0aDolphin  frequented  at  Intervals  the  accustomed  Place,  as %0aone  that  was  sadly  distressed ;  at  last  (in  a  Manner  that  no %0aone  could  doubt)  he  also  died  from  Regret.1 %0a%0a1  The  works  of  ancient  naturalists  abound  in  stories  concerning  the %0aDolphin  and  its  friendliness  to  the  human  race ;  and  from  circumstances %0awhich  the  Editor  has  been  made  acquainted  with,  it  would  appear  that  on %0asome  occasions  slight  signs  of  recognition  have  been  occasionally  mani- %0afested between  at  least  some  species  of  cetaceous  animals  and  voyagers. %0aThere  is  reason  to  believe,  however,  that  these  approaches  to  intimacy %0ahave  been  directed  rather  to  the  ship  than  the  sailors,  and  that  the  crea- %0ature has  mistaken  the  vessel  for  one  of  its  own  kind.  It  must  be  allowed %0athat  nothing  similar  to  the  circumstances  ascribed  to  this  creature  by %0aPliny,  JElian,  and  the  Greek  writers  quoted  by  Aulus  Gellius,  has  been %0aseen  in  modern  times;  but  the  multitude  of  witnesses,  and  the  alleged %0apublicity  of  some  of  these  occurrences,  may  be  regarded  as  warrants  that %0asomething  at  least  unusual  had  occurred  at  the  time  referred  to.  It  may %0aserve  in  eliciting  the  truth,  if  we  compare  the  narratives  of  these  ancient %0aauthors  with  one  another,  and  with  the  well-known  habits  and  appear- %0aance of  the  Dolphin  (Delphinus  Delphis).  .ZElian's  account  of  a  circum- %0astance exceedingly  similar  to  this  of  Pliny,  is,  with  a  slight  abridgment, %0athus  (B.  vi.  c.  15)  :  —  "The  celebrated  instance  of  affection  which  a  Dol- %0aphin at  Jasos  (in  Caria)  expressed  for  a  beautiful  boy  must  not  be  passed %0aover  in  silence.  The  gymnasium  of  the  people  of  Jasos  overlooks  the %0a%0a%0a1 16  History  of  Nature.  [BooK  IX. %0a%0aAnother  Dolphin,  not  many  Years  since,  upon  the  Coast %0aof  Africa,  near  to  Hippo  Diarrhytus,  in  like  Manner  would %0a%0a%0asea ;  and  after  the  races  were  over,  it  was  the  custom  of  the  young  men %0ato  go  to  the  shore  and  bathe.  On  one  occasion  when  they  were  indulging %0athemselves  in  swimming,  a  dolphin  was  attracted  with  the  most  vehement %0alove  to  one  of  these  youths,  who  was  remarkably  beautiful.  When  first %0athe  creature  approached  him  he  was  not  a  little  afraid ;  but  as  the  fami- %0aliarity increased  the  young  man  became  so  conciliated,  that  he  learned  to %0aregard  him  with  kindness  and  friendship.  They  played  together,  and %0acontended  in  swimming ;  and  the  boy  would  sit  on  his  back,  and  be  car- %0aried about  as  on  a  horse.  The  sight  soon  attracted  the  attention  of  the %0apeople  of  the  place,  and  also  of  strangers.  The  dolphin  continued  to %0amanifest  his  love  for  this  young  man,  and  would  carry  him  out  to  sea,  as %0afar  as  was  agreeable  to  his  friend  ;  and  then  he  would  return  and  deposit %0ahim  on  the  shore.  This  dolphin  was  accustomed  to  make  his  appearance %0aat  the  time  when  the  young  man  was  dismissed  from  the  gymnasium; %0aand  their  joy  on  meeting  appeared  to  be  mutual.  This,  however,  at  last, %0amet  with  a  fatal  termination ;  for  the  boy,  being  tired  with  exercise,  on %0aone  occasion  threw  himself,  naked  as  he  was,  on  the  back  of  the  dolphin, %0anot  observing  the  sharp  spine  on  the  back  of  the  animal,  as  it  stood  erect; %0aand  thus  he  pierced  himself  at  the  navel  with  its  point :  a  vein  being %0awounded,  by  which  he  bled  to  death.  The  dolphin  was  not  slow  in  dis- %0acovering that  his  friend  was  seriously  injured  —  partly  by  the  difference %0aof  weight,  for  he  did  not  sit  on  his  back  in  the  light  and  active  manner %0ahe  had  been  accustomed  to,  and  partly  by  seeing  the  water  stained %0awith  blood ;  he  therefore  resolved  not  to  survive  him  whom  he  had  so %0aaffectionately  loved.  He  ran  himself,  with  all  his  might,  upon  the  shore, %0aand  both  of  them  died  together.  A  monument  was  raised  by  the  people %0aof  the  city  to  commemorate  this  love  between  the  young  man  and  the %0adolphin."  And  the  author  concludes  by  saying,  that  he  had  heard  of  other %0ainstances  of  similar  affection :  one  of  which  had  occurred  at  Puteoli,  in %0aItaly ;  and  which,  doubtless,  was  the  same  as  is  mentioned  by  Pliny. %0a%0aAulus  Gellius  adds  to  this  an  instance  which  he  had  derived  from %0aApion,  whom,  as  an  author  on  the  subject  of  wonders,  we  have  mentioned %0abefore  (Vol.  i.  p.  21),  and  who  authenticates  the  story  by  affirming  that %0ahe  saw  it  himself:  —  "I  saw,"  says  he,  "near  Dicsearchia  (Puteoli),  a %0adolphin  that  had  great  affection  for  a  boy,  and  manifested  this  feeling  at %0athe  sound  of  his  voice.  The  fish  would  then  swim  near,  and  take  the  lad %0aon  his  back  ;  he  would  fold  back  the  spines  of  his  fins  that  he  might  not %0ahurt  him,  and  then  would  carry  him  to  the  distance  of  two  hundred %0astadia,  astride  on  his  back.  Rome,  therefore,  and  all  Italy,  were  poured %0aout  to  see  this  affectionate  fish."  It  is  to  be  regretted  that  the  works  of %0aApion  have  perished  ;  but  the  little  that  remains  is  sufficient  to  show  that %0a%0a%0aBOOK  1 X .]  History  of  Nature.  1 1 7 %0a%0atake  Meat  from  a  Man's  Hand,  suffer  himself  to  be  handled, %0aplay  with  them  that  swam  in  the  Sea,  and  carry  on  his  Back %0a%0ahis  authority  must  not  carry  great  weight,  even  when  he  professes  to %0ahave  himself  witnessed  the  occurrence.  This  Egyptian  is  also  the  autho- %0arity for  the  story  of  Androclus  and  the  Lion ;  which  he  also  asserts  to %0ahave  occurred  under  his  own  notice.  Yet,  setting  aside  the  negative %0aevidence  derived  from  the  silence  of  Pliny,  who,  if  he  had  believed  it, %0awould  have  found  it  an  excellent  illustration  of  his  history  of  that  beast, %0athere  is  one  portion  of  it  which  is  altogether  incredible  :  and  the  doubt %0aarising  from  which  must  render  suspicious  whatever  of  a  surprising %0anature  the  same  author  anywhere  reports.  He  says,  that  with  the  gift %0aof  freedom,  Androclus  also  was  presented  with  the  lion ;  which  he  led %0aquietly  about  the  city,  with  a  slight  string,  collecting  money  at  the %0ataverns.  To  enhance  the  wonder,  the  beast  is  represented  to  have  been %0aof  unusual  size  and  ferocity ;  but  however  well  disposed  such  an  animal %0amight  be  to  recognize  one  from  whom  it  had  received  an  obligation,  it  is %0acontrary  to  its  nature  for  a  fierce  and  hitherto  untamed  lion  to  have %0achanged  its  character  so  far  as  to  have  been  reconciled  suddenly  to  the %0anoisy  crowd  of  a  city,  and  to  have  been  led,  only  by  a  slight  string, %0acrowned  with  flowers,  without  fearing  or  doing  harm. %0a%0aThe  narratives  of  the  dolphin  are  equally  contrary  to  nature,  and %0athat  in  several  particulars,  in  which  an  intelligent  observer  could  not  be %0amistaken :  whether  that  observer  was  Apion,  whom  A.  Gellius  charac- %0aterizes as  being  "  vitio  studioque  ostentationis  loquacior,"  and  "  sane  quam %0apraedicandis  doctrinis  suis  venditator : "  or  Mecaenas  himself.  Of  these %0aerrors  one  concerns  the  form  of  the  animal,  which  is  described  as  having %0athe  mouth  beneath  the  head,  and  a  dorsal  fin  armed  with  sharp-pointed %0aspines,  capable  of  voluntary  motion :  the  latter,  especially,  not  only  un- %0alike what  belongs  to  the  dolphin,  but  to  anything  that  could  have  been %0amistaken  for  it.  The  mode  of  progress  in  the  water  of  the  real  dolphin, %0ais  also  known  to  be  such  as  does  not  admit  these  stories  to  be  applied  to %0ait.  The  dolphin  rises  to  the  surface  for  the  purpose  of  breathing ;  and %0athen  is  compelled  to  roll  itself  forward  in  a  manner  which  does  not %0aadmit  of  its  continuing  to  pass  along  the  surface,  even  to  the  extent  of %0aa  few  yards.  But  what  thus  appears  inapplicable  to  the  structure  and %0ahabits  of  the  real  dolphin  is  not  exceedingly  foreign  to  another  inha- %0abitant of  the  ocean.  The  common  Seal  (Phoca  Vitulina)  has  on  some %0aoccasions  manifested  all  the  affectionate  attachment  to  man  which  the %0aancients  ascribed  to  the  dolphin.  A  little  instruction  will  secure  this ; %0aand  however  it  might  have  been  concealed  for  interested  purposes,  there %0acan  be  little  doubt  that  the  creatures  of  which  these  stories  were  related %0ain  ancient  times,  had  been  previously  trained  to  the  actions  they %0a[,  —  Wern.

Alexander  the  Great %0aappointed  this  Boy  to  be  the  Priest  of  Neptune  at  Babylon  : %0ainterpreting  the  Love  of  this  Dolphin  as  a  Sign  of  the  special %0aFavour  of  that  god  to  him. %0a%0aEgesidemus  writeth,  that  in  the  same  City  of  Jassus  there %0awas  another  Boy  named  Hermias,  who  having  used  in  the  same %0aManner  to  ride  upon  a  Dolphin  over  the  Sea,  was  in  a  sud- %0aden Storm  drowned  in  the  Waves,  and  was  brought  back  by %0athe  Dolphin ;  who,  confessing  that  he  was  the  Cause  of  his %0aDeath,  did  not  return  into  the  Sea,  but  died  on  the  dry  Land. %0a%0aThe  like  happened  at  Naupactum,  by  the  Report  of  Theo- %0aphrastus.  But  there  is  no  End  of  such  Examples  ;  for  the %0aAmphilochi  and  Tarentini  relate  the  same  concerning  Boys %0aand  Dolphins  ;  which  Instances  induce  us  also  to  believe %0athat  Arioti,  who  was  a  skilful  Player  on  the  Harp,  when  the %0aSailors  were  preparing  to  kill  him,  by  throwing  him  into  the %0aSea,  and  so  intercept  all  his  Gains,  by  conciliating  them, %0aobtained  the  Favour  that  he  might  first  be  permitted  to  sing- %0ato  his  Harp ;  and  a  number  of  Dolphins  having  flocked %0aabout  him  in  consequence  of  his  Music,  when  they  threw %0ahim  into  the  Sea,  he  was  received  by  one  of  them,  and %0acarried  to  the  Shore  of  Tsenarus. %0a%0aIn  the  Province  of  Narbonensis,  and  in  the  Territory  of %0aNsemausium,  there  is  a  Pond  called  Laterra,  where  Men  and %0a%0a%0aBOOK  IX.]  History  of  Nature.  119 %0a%0aDolphins  fish  in  company :  for  at  one  certain  Time  a  very %0agreat  Abundance  of  Mullets,1  taking  the  Advantage  of  a %0aChange  of  the  Tide  at  the  narrow  Passages  of  the  Pond, %0abreak  forth  into  the  Sea ;  and  because  of  that  Violence  no %0aNets  can  be  spread  out  against  them  by  any  Means  strong %0aenough  to  bear  their  huge  Weight  with  that  of  the  Stream  of %0aWater,  if  Skill  were  not  employed  at  the  proper  Time.     In %0alike  Manner  the  Mullets  immediately  urge  on  to  the  Deep, %0awhich  they  do  very  soon,  as  the  Channel  is  near ;  and  they %0amake  all  Haste  to  pass  the  only  Place  that  is  convenient  for %0aspreading  the  Nets.     The  Fishermen  being  aware  of  this, %0aand  all  the  neighbouring  People  (for  a  Multitude  of  People %0acome  thither,  knowing  when  the  fishing  Time  is  come ;  and %0athe  rather  as  they  are  eager  to  see  the  pleasant  Sport),  shout %0aas  loud  as  they  can  from  the  Shore,  and  so  call  Simo  to %0apartake  of  the  Sight.     The  Dolphins  soon  hear  what  they %0awould  have ;  and  the  better  if  the  North  Winds  blow  and %0acarry  the  Sound :  for  a  South  Wind  more  slowly  bears  it  in %0athe  opposite  Direction.     But  before  one  would  be  aware  of %0ait,  the  Dolphins  fly  thither  to  assist  in  the  Fishing.     The %0aSquadrons  of  those  Dolphins  quickly  take  their  Station,  and %0aare  presently  arranged  in  the  Place  where  the  Battle  is  dis- %0aposed, to  oppose  themselves,  and  keep  them  from  the  Deep; %0aand  so  urge  them,  terrified  as  they  are,  into  the  Shallows. %0aThen  the  Fishermen  enclose  them  with  Nets,  which  they  prop %0aup  with  forked  Sticks  ;  yet  notwithstanding  this,  the  Mullets %0aare  so  active  that  they  will  leap  over  them.     But  these  are %0acaught  by  the    Dolphins,   who,  contenting  themselves  for %0athe  present  to  kill  only,  put  off  the  Time  of  feeding  until %0athey  have  achieved  the  Victory.     And  now  the  Work  of  the %0aBattle  is  hot,  for  the  Dolphins  are  very  eager,  and  take  Plea- %0asure to  be  enclosed  within  the  Nets;  but  lest  this  should %0adrive  the  Enemies  to  flight,  they  pass    so  gently  between %0athe  Boats  and  Nets,  or  the  Men  there  swimming,  that  it %0acannot  be  seen  where  they  get  out.     And  although  at  other %0a%0a1  See  chapter  xvii.  The  habits  here  ascribed  to  this  fish,  and  the %0anecessity  of  staking  up  the  nets  when  it  is  enclosed  in  it,  are  well  known %0aat  the  present  time.  —  See  YABRELL'S  British  Fishes.  —  Wern.

[BooK  IX. %0a%0aTimes  they  take  great  Delight  in  leaping,  yet  none  endea- %0avour to  get  forth  by  that  Means,  except  where  the  Nets %0alie  under  them  ;  but  no  sooner  are  they  out,  than  a  Contest %0abegins  before  the  Bulwark ;  and  so  the  Capture  being %0aaccomplished,  the  Dolphins  tear  to  Pieces  those  they  have %0akilled.  But  conscious  to  themselves  that  their  Labour  hath %0aearned  a  richer  Reward  than  what  belongs  to  one  Day,  they %0aconceal  themselves  until  the  next;  and  are  not  contented %0awith  Fish  only,  but  wait  to  receive  Crumbs  of  Bread  soaked %0ain  Wine.  Mutianus  maketh  mention  of  some  Things  of  a %0asimilar  Kind  of  Fishing  in  the  Bay  of  Jassus  ;  but  they  differ %0ain  this,  that  the  Dolphins  come  of  their  own  accord,  without %0acalling,  take  their  Part  of  the  Prize  from  the  Fishermen's %0aHands;  and  every  Boat  hath  a  Dolphin  attending  upon  it  as %0aa  Companion,  although  it  is  by  Night,  and  with  Torchlight. %0aAlso  Dolphins  have  a  public  Society  among  themselves; %0afor  a  King  of  Caria  having  taken  a  Dolphin,  and  kept  him  con- %0afined in  the  Harbour,  a  great  Multitude  of  the  others  resorted %0athither,  and  by  Signs  of  Mourning,  evident  to  be  understood, %0acraved  Mercy  for  the  Prisoner :  until  the  King  had  given %0aCommand  to  set  him  at  Liberty.  Also  the  little  ones  are %0aalways  accompanied  with  some  larger  one,  as  a  Keeper. %0aAnd  they  have  been  seen  to  carry  one  of  their  Companions %0awhen  he  is  dead,  that  he  might  not  be  torn  by  Beasts. %0a%0aCHAPTER  IX. %0aOf  Tursiones. %0a%0aThe  Creatures  which  are  called  Tursiones,  are  much  like %0athe  Dolphins;  but  they  differ  in  having  a  more  gloomy  As- %0apect :  for  they  are  not  so  playful  ;  but  especially  in  having %0aSnouts  like  little  Dogs  when  they  snarl. %0a%0aCHAPTER  X. %0aOf  Sea- Tortoises,  and  how  they  are  taken. %0a%0aTHERE  are  Tortoises  in  the  Indian  Sea  so  great  that  the %0aNatives  cover  the  Cottages  in  which  they  dwell  with  the  Shell %0a%0a%0aBOOK  IX.]  History  of  Nature.  1 2 1 %0a%0aof  a  single  one  of  them.  And  among  the  Islands,  principally %0ain  the  Red  Sea,  they  use  them  for  Boats. %0a%0aMany  Ways  the  Fishermen  have  to  catch  them  ;  but %0aespecially  as  in  the  Mornings,  when  the  Weather  is  still, %0athey  float  on  the  open  Sea  with  their  Backs  high  above  the %0acalm  Surface;  and  then  the  Pleasure  of  breathing  freely  so %0aentirely  deceives  them  into  Forgetful  ness,  that  their  Crust %0abecomes  dried  with  the  Sun's  Heat,  and  they  cannot  dive, %0abut  are  forced  againt  their  Wills  to  float,  and  so  are  exposed %0aas  a  Prize  to  those  that  hunt  them.  Some  say  that  they  go %0aout  in  the  oNight  to  feed;  arid  with  eating  greedily,  grow %0aweary  ;  so  that  in  the  Morning,  when  they  are  returning %0aagain,  they  fall  asleep  on  the  Surface  of  the  Water  ;  and  then %0athey  utter  such  a  Snoring  as  to  be  easily  taken.  But  three %0aMen  must  swim  to  every  one  of  them  :  two  of  them  to  turn %0ahim  upon  his  Back,  and  the  third  to  throw  a  Cord  about %0ahim  as  he  lieth  with  his  Belly  upward ;  and  then  is  he %0ahauled  by  many  to  the  Land.  In  the  Phoenician  Sea  they %0aare  taken  with  very  little  Difficulty;  for  at  a  certain  Time %0aof  the  Year  they  resort  of  themselves,  in  great  Multitudes,  to %0athe  River  Eleutherus. %0a%0aThe  Tortoise  hath  no  Teeth,  but  the  Borders  of  his  Snout %0aare  sharp ;  the  upper  part  shutting  close  upon  the  under, %0alike  a  Box.  In  the  Sea  they  live  on  Shellfish,  for  their %0aMouths  are  so  hard  that  they  crush  Stones.

Their  Young,  which  accompany  their  Dams  back %0ainto  the  Sea  in  the  Autumn,  are  called  Cordylae.  Afterwards %0athey  begin  to  call  them  Pelamydes,1  and  Limosce,  from  the %0aMud  :  and  when  they  are  above  one  Year  old,  they  are  called %0aTunnies.  These  Tunnies  are  cut  into  Portions ;  the  Neck, %0aBelly,  and  the  Throat  being  commended  for  Meat :  but %0aonly  when  they  are  fresh,  and  even  then  they  will  rise  on  a %0aMan's  Stomach.  The  other  Parts  being  full  of  good  Meat, %0aare  laid  in  Salt.  They  are  called  Melandrya,  and  when  cut %0ain  Slices,  are  exceedingly  like  to  Oak  Boards.  The  worst %0aPieces  of  these  are  those  nearest  the  Tail,  because  they  are %0anot  fat :  the  best  is  that  which  is  toward  the  Throat:  but  in %0aother  Fishes  the  Tail-piece  (is  in  greatest  request),  as  being %0athe  most  exercised.  Pelamides  are  divided  into  Parcels, %0awhich  are  named  Apolecti;  but  when  they  are  separated %0ainto  Sorts,  named  Cybii. %0a%0aAll  Kinds  of  Fishes  grow  with  remarkable  Rapidity  to %0atheir  full  Size,  and  especially  in  the  Pontus :  the  Reason  is, %0abecause  a  number  of  Rivers  bring  fresh  Water  into  it.  There %0ais  one  called  Amia,2  which  groweth  so  fast,  that  a  Man  may %0aperceive  it  from  Day  to  Day.  These  Fishes,  together  with %0athe  Tunnies  and  the  Pelamides,  enter  in  great  Schuls  into %0athe  Pontus,  for  the  sweeter  Food  they  find  there ;  each %0aCompany  with  its  own  Leader:  and  before  them  all,  the %0aMackerels  lead  the  Way ;  which,  while  they  are  in  the %0aWater,  have  a  Colour  of  Brimstone ;  but  out  of  it  they  are %0alike  the  rest.  The  Mackerels3  fill  the  Fish-markets  in  Spain, %0awhen  the  Tunnies  do  not  find  their  Way  into  their  Seas. %0aBut  into  the  Pontus  there  enter  no  Beasts  that  injure %0aFishes,  unless  it  be  Seals  and  little  Dolphins.

And  there  are %0asome  Sorts  of  them  of  which  there  are  altogether  no  Males; %0aas  the  Erythini,1  and  the  Chani :  for  they  are  taken  always %0aheavy  with  Spawn. %0a%0aScaly  Fishes  for  the  most  part  swim  in  Schuls,  each  ac- %0acording to  its  Kind.  The  Fishing  is  before  the  Sun  is  up; %0afor  then  Fishes  are  most  liable  to  be  deceived  in  their  Sight. %0aIf  the  Nights  are  bright,  they  see  as  well  then  as  by  Day. %0aThey  affirm  it  is  good  fishing  twice  in  the  same  Gulf;  for  so %0amore  are  caught  in  the  second  Cast  than  by  the  first.  Fishes %0agreatly  delight  in  the  Taste  of  Oil ;  and  next  to  this,  in %0agentle  Showers ;  and  with  these  they  become  fat.

The  following  quotation  from  the  second  edition  of %0aMr.  Yarrell's  "History  of  British  Fishes"  (vol.  i.  p.  13)  will  illustrate %0athe  question,  hitherto  generally  received  in  the  affirmative,  of  the  herma- %0aphroditism  of  these  fishes  : — "  Since  the  publication  of  the  first  edition  of %0athis  work,  Mr.  Couch  has  been  kind  enough  to  send  me  the  roes  of  two %0aspecimens  of  this  Serranus  (Cabrilla).  These,  on  examination,  contained %0atrue  ova  only ;  and  Mr.  Owen,  of  the  College  of  Surgeons,  whose  micro- %0ascope was  used  on  this  occasion,  agreed  with  me,  that  although  these %0aorgans  were  of  small  size,  there  was  nothing  equivocal  either  in  the %0astructure  or  appearance."  —  Wern.

These  Mugils  nevertheless  are  so  libidi- %0anous, that  in  the  Season  of  Increase,  in  Phoanice  and  the %0aProvince  of  Narbonensis  (Languedoc),  if  they  take  a  Male %0aout  of  their  Ponds,  and  draw  a  long  Line  through  the  Mouth %0aand  Gills,  and  so  tie  it  fast,  and  then  put  him  into  the  Sea, %0aholding  the  other  end  of  the  Line,  if  they  draw  him  back %0aagain,  the  Females  follow  him  to  the  Shore.

Afterwards,  Cornelius  JVepos  and  Laberias  the  comic %0aPoet  have  written,  that  the  Lupus  and  Asellus  obtained  the %0achief  Credit.  Of  the  Lupus,  those  that  are  the  most  com- %0amended are  those  which  are  called  Lanati,  from  the  White- %0aness and  Tenderness  of  their  Flesh.  Of  Aselli,  there  are  two %0aSorts :  Callarige,1  which  are  the  less ;  and  Bacchi,  which  are %0anever  taken  but  in  deep  Water,  and  therefore  they  are  pre- %0aferred to  the  former.  But  the  Lupi  that  are  caught  in  the %0aRiver  are  preferred  to  the  others.  The  Scarus2  hath  now %0aassigned  to  it  the  chief  Place ;  and  it  is  said  to  be  the  only %0aFish  that  cheweth  the  Cud,  and  to  live  on  Herbs  and  not %0aon  other  Fishes.  It  is  chiefly  found  in  the  Carpathian  Sea ; %0aand  of  its  own  accord  never  passeth  the  Promontory  Lectos %0ain  Troas.  When  Tiberius  Claudius  was  Sovereign,  Optatus^ %0ahis  Freedman  and  Admiral  of  the  Fleet,  brought  them  out  of %0athat  Sea,  and  dispersed  them  between  Ostia  and  the  Coast %0aof  Campania.  Care  was  taken  by  strict  Command,  for %0aalmost  five  Years,  that  if  any  were  taken  they  should  be %0areturned  into  the  Sea.  After  this  they  were  frequently  found %0aalong  the  Coast  of  Italy,  whereas  before  they  had  not  been %0ataken.  And  thus  Gluttony  hath  supplied  its  Taste  by  sowing %0aFish,  and  given  a  new  Inhabitant  to  the  Sea,  to  take  away %0aour  Wonder  that  foreign  Birds  are  prepared  at  Rome.

They  are  bred  only  in  the  North  Sea;  and %0anever  in  the  nearest  Coast  of  the  West  Ocean.  Moreover,  of %0athis  Fish  there  are  several  Sorts.

Among %0athe  Romans  this  fish  was  indispensable  at  tables  which  made  any  preten- %0asions to  fashion ;  and  at  the  same  time  it  was  the  most  costly  of  all  their %0adishes :  so  that  it  is  referred  to  by  the  poets  as  a  glaring  example  of  the %0aextravagance  that  pervaded  the  city.  When  this  first  reached  the  weight %0aof  two  pounds,  the  ordinary  price  was  its  own  weight  in  silver.  Horace %0amentions  as  enormous  one  which  weighed  three  pounds;  though  this %0adoes  not  exceed  what  the  Editor  has  seen  on  the  coast  of  Cornwall.  Two, %0awhich  were  caught  nearly  together,  weighed  two  and  two-and-a-quarter %0apounds  avoirdupois :  the  latter  being  precisely  the  weight  of  Horace's %0afish  of  thirty  -six  ounces.  Martial  speaks  of  a  Surmullet  of  four  pounds ; %0aand  Seneca  relates  a  story  of  the  avarice  of  Tiberius,  who  sent  a  mullet %0aweighing  four-and-a-half  pounds  to  market,  where,  perhaps  to  flatter  the %0aemperor,  two  noblemen  contended  who  should  purchase  it ;  by  which  it %0areached  the  price  of  5000  sesterces.  Juvenal,  perhaps  with  exaggeration, %0aspeaks  of  one  that  weighed  six  pounds.  Suetonius  states,  that  for  three %0aof  these  fishes  was  paid  at  one  time  30,000  sesterces;  and  Martial  wrote %0aan  epigram  on  one  who  sold  a  servant  to  raise  the  means  of  making %0aa  sumptuous  supper,  at  which  the  principal  dish,  and  the  one  that  swal- %0alowed up  the  chief  expense,  was  the  enormous  Surmullet  above-men- %0ationed. —  (B.  x.  Ep.  30.)  Those  who  wished  to  ape  the  great,  without %0asufficient  means,  were  obliged  to  be  satisfied  with  half  a  mullet.  "  Mul- %0alum  dimidium,  lapumque  totum,  mursenaeque  latus "  —  (Martial) :  the %0a"  side  "  of  murasna  being  on  the  same  scale  of  stinted  luxury.  When  an %0aepicure  was  asked  whether  these  prices  were  not  absurd,  he  replied  that %0atwo  morsels  of  the  fish  were  worth  the  expense  :  the  head  and  the  liver. %0aThe  latter  formed  a  delicious  sauce ;  but  the  head  must  have  been  valued %0aonly  because  there  was  so  little  in  it.  Attempts  were  made  to  breed  these %0afishes  in  ponds ;  but  tiiey  could  not  bear  the  confinement ;  so  that  not %0aOnly  did  they  cease  to  grow  in  size,  but  not  more  than  one  or  two  in  a %0athousand  continued  alive. %0a%0aThe  fish  mentioned  at  the  beginning  of  the  next  chapter,  as  a  mullet %0aof  the  Red  Sea,  must  have  been  of  another  species,  and  even  genus. — %0a—  Wern.

They %0aspawn  three  Times  in  the  Year ;  for  so  often  their  Young %0aare  certainly  seen.  The  principal  Epicures  say,  that  a  Mul- %0alus, when  dying,  changeth  his  Colour,  which  may  be  seen  to %0atake  a  great  Variety  of  Tints ;  passing  from  pale  by  a  Variety %0aof  Mutations  to  glowing  red  all  over  his  Scales,  particularly %0aif  it  be  looked  at  as  he  is  held  in  a  Glass.  M.

And  he  also  incited  them  to  contrive  a  Pickle  made %0afrom  their  Livers.  For  surely  it  is  more  easy  to  say  this  than %0ato  set  down  who  excelled  in  it.  Asturius  Celer,  a  Man  of %0aconsular  Rank,  showed  his  Prodigality  in  this  Fish,  for %0awhen  C.  Caligula  was  Sovereign,  he  gave  for  one  Mullet %0aeight  thousand  Sesterces :  the  Consideration  of  which  car- %0arieth  far  away  my  Mind  to  the  Contemplation  of  those  who, %0ain  their  Reproof  of  Luxury,  complained  that  a  Cook  was %0apurchased  at  a  greater  Price  than  a  Horse.  For  now  a  Cook %0awill  cost  as  much  as  the  Expense  of  a  Triumph ;  and  Fishes %0aare  as  dear  as  Cooks.  And  no  mortal  Man  is  esteemed  more %0athan  he  who  hath  the  most  Skill  to  waste  the  Goods  and %0aconsume  the  Property  of  his  Lord. %0a%0a1  Probably  Trigla  lineata :  a  fish  which  has  much  the  habits  of  the %0aMullus,  and  is  often  taken  in  the  same  net ;  on  which  account,  and  some %0aresemblance  of  form,  it  was  called  by  the  older  naturalists,  Mullus  imberbis. %0a—  Wern.

That  these  Creatures  should  have  the  Under- %0astanding thus  to  know  the  Causes,  and  observe  the  Changes %0aof  Times,  is  the  more  wonderful,  if  we  would  only  consider %0ahow  few  Men  there  are  aware  that  the  best  Season  for  fishing %0ais  while  the  Sun  passeth  through  the  Sign  Pisces. %0a%0aCHAPTER  XX. %0a%0aAn  Arrangement  of  Fishes  according  to  the  Shape  of  their %0a%0aBodies. %0a%0aOF  Sea- Fishes  some  are  flat,  as  Rhoinbi,  Soleae,  and %0aPasseres  ;3  and  the  latter  differ  from  the  Rhombi  only  in  the %0aPosition  of  their  Bodies.  In  the  Rhombus  the  right  Side %0aturneth  upward,  and  in  the  Passer  the  left.  Others  are  long, %0aas  the  Muraena  and  Conger.  On  this  Account  they  have %0aDistinctions  formed  by  their  Fins,  which  Nature  hath  given %0a%0a1  Blennius   cristatus,  LINN.:   but  the  same  habit  is  common  to  the %0aB.  pholis,  or  Shanny.  —  Wern.

Only  in  the  Lake  Fucinus %0athere  is  a  Fish,  which  in  swimming  useth  eight  Fins.  All %0aFishes  that  are  long  and  slippery,  as  Eels  and  Congers,  have %0aordinarily  two.  Muraenae1  have  none,  nor  any  Gills:  all  of %0athese  Kinds  act  upon  the  Sea  by  bending  their  Bodies,  as %0aSerpents  on  the  Land.  They  creep  also  on  dry  Land ;  and %0atherefore  such  are  more  retentive  of  Life.  Also  among  flat %0aFishes  some  have  no  Fins,  as  the  Pastinaca  ;2  for  their %0aBreadth  serveth  them  sufficiently  to  swim  with.  And  among %0athose  which  are  denominated  Soft,  the  Polypi  have  no  Fins, %0abecause  their  Feet  stand  them  instead  of  Fins, %0a%0aCHAPTER  XXI. %0aOf  Eels* %0a%0aEELS  live  eight  Years.  And  if  the  North  Wind  blows, %0athey  continue  without  Water  six  Days ;  but  not  so  long  in  a %0aSouth  Wind.  Yet  in  Winter-time  they  cannot  endure  the %0asame  Exposure  in  a  small  Quantity  of  Water  ;  nor  if  it  be %0amuddy ;  and  therefore  about  the  rising  of  the  Star  Virgilise %0athey  are  most  abundantly  taken,  because  the  Rivers  about %0athat  Time  are  the  most  muddy.  Their  Feeding  is  by  Night. %0aOf  all  Fish  they  alone  do  not  float  when  dead. %0a%0aCHAPTER  XXII. %0aOf  taking  them  in  the  Lake  JBenacus. %0a%0aTHERE  is  a  Lake  in  Italy  called  Benacus,  in  the  Territory %0aof  Verona,  through  which  the  River  Mincius  runneth :  at %0athe  Outlet  of  which  every  Year,  about  the  Month  of  October, %0a%0a1  The  Mursena  has  a  fin  passing  along  the  back  to  the  extremity  of %0athe  body,  where  it  is  united  to  the  anal,  and  forms  a  caudal  fin,  as  in  the %0aEel.    It  has  gills,  also,  with  a  perfect  organization  concealed  within  the %0aintegument ;  but  the  aperture  is  obscure.  —  Wern.  Club. %0a%0a2  Raia  pastinaca.  —  LINN.

The %0aEggs  grow  very  rapidly.  The  common  People  believe  that %0athey  creep  out  of  the  Water  to  the  dry  Land,  and  become %0aimpregnated  by  Serpents.  Aristotle  calleth  the  Male  or %0aMilter,  Myrus.  The  Difference,  that  the  Mursena  is  of  a %0aVariety  of  Colours,  and  weak ;  but  the  Myrus1  is  of  a  uniform %0aColour,  and  strong,  with  Teeth  projecting  beyond  his  Mouth. %0aIn  the  North  Parts  of  Gallia  all  the  Mursenee  have  on  their %0aright  Jaw  seven  Spots,  distributed  like  the  seven  Stars  about %0athe  North  Pole  (Septentrio).  These  are  of  a  golden  Colour %0aso  long  as  the  Muraena  is  alive :  but  they  are  not  seen  after %0ait  is  dead.  Vedius  Pollio,  a  Roman  Knight,  and  one  of  the %0aFriends  of  Divus  Augustus,  contrived  Experiments  of  Cruelty %0aby  Means  of  this  Creature.  For  he  caused  his  Slaves  that %0awere  condemned  to  die,  to  be  thrown  into  the  Ponds  where %0ahis  Mursense  were  kept :  not  because  the  Wild  Beasts  of  the %0aLand  were  not  sufficient  to  do  this,  but  because  in  any  other %0aWay  of  Proceeding  he  would  not  have  been  able  to  view  a %0aMan  plucked  in  Pieces  all  at  once,  and  at  his  Leisure.  It  is %0asaid,  that  if  they  taste  Vinegar  they  are  driven  to  Madness. %0aThey  have  a  very  thin  Skin  ;  and,  on  the  contrary,  Eels  have %0ait  thick  :  so  that  Verrius  writeth,  that  Children  under  seven %0a%0a1  The  Myrus  is  a  distinct  species,  Mur.  myrus,  LINN,  and  Cuv.  The %0aMuraena  was  one  of  the  petted  objects  of  luxury  of  the  Romans,  and %0atherefore  sedulously  propagated  in  ponds. — Went.

All  this  kind  in  general  Aristotle %0awas  the  first  to  call  in  Greek  Selache  :  we  cannot  distinguish %0athem  by  this  Name,  unless  we  are  permitted  to  call  them %0aCartilaginous  Fishes.  But  all  the  Sort  of  them  that  devour %0aFlesh  are  such ;  and  they  feed  as  they  lie  supine,  like  as  we %0aobserved  in  the  Dolphins.  And  whereas  other  Fishes  cast %0aSpawn,  this  Class  only,  in  the  same  manner  as  those %0awhich  we  call  Cete,1  bring  forth  their  Young  alive ;  with  the %0aException,  however,  of  that  one  which  they  call  Rana. %0a%0a1  The  name  of  Cete  is  here  mentioned  as  equivalent  to  Balaena  for %0athe  Whales,  ch.  6 :  but  the  mode  in  which  they  bear  their  young  is  very %0adifferent  from  that  of  the  cartilaginous  fishes,  though  both,  or  at  least  the %0aSharks  among  the  latter,  are  viviparous.  The  Whales  are  placental %0aanimals,  but  all  true  fishes  produce  eggs,  although  in  some  instances  they %0aare  hatched  within  the  body  of  the  parent. %0a%0aThe  fishes  here  mentioned  are :  Eaia,  —  several  species  of  Rays  and %0aSkates ;  Pastinaca,  mentioned  before,  ch.  20 ;  Squatina,  Squalus  squatina, %0aLinn.,  and  Squatina  vulgaris^  Cuv. ;  the  Monk,  or  Angel-fish ;  and  Tor- %0apedo, ch.  16.  The  Bos  is  a  gigantic  species  of  Ray,  Raia  cephaloptera : %0aforming  the  genus  Cephaloptera  of  Cuvier ;  and  Oppian  (B.  ii.)  gives  an %0aaccount  of  the  great  injury  it  does  to  the  divers  for  coral,  by  clasping %0athem  and  preventing  their  ascent  to  the  surface.

[BooK  IX. %0a%0aCHAPTER  XXV. %0aOf  the  Echeneis. %0a%0aTHERE  is  a  very  little  Fish  called  Echeneis,1  that  keeps %0aordinarily  about  Rocks.  It  is  believed  that  if  it  adhere  to %0athe  Keel  of  a  Ship  it  goeth  the  more  slowly ;  and  from  this %0ait  took  its  Name :  for  the  same  Cause  also  it  hath  a  bad %0aReputation  for  its  use  in  amatory  Medicines,  and  in  causing %0aDelay  of  Actions  at  Law  and  judicial  Decisions.  But  both %0athese  Offences  are  counterbalanced  by  one  commendation :  for %0ait  restraineth  Haemorrhage  threatening  Abortion  in  pregnant %0aWomen,  and  holdeth  the  Child  to  the  full  Time  of  Birth. %0aNotwithstanding,  it  is  not  allowed  to  be  eaten.  Aristotle %0athinketh  that  it  hath  Feet,  as  the  Fins  stand  thick  cne  by %0aanother. %0a%0aThe  Murex,  Mutianus  saith,  is  broader  than  the  Purpura, %0ahaving  a  Mouth  neither  rough  nor  round,  and  with  a  Beak %0anot  protruding  in  an  Angle,  but  simple,  the  Shell  on  both %0aSides  turning  itself  inward.  These  Shells  adhered  to  a  Ship %0aconveying  Messengers  from  Periander  with  Commission  to %0aemasculate  the  Noblemen's  Sons,  and  caused  it  to  remain %0astill,  although  it  was  under  Sail  with  a  strong  Gale.  And %0athe  Shells  which  accomplished  this  are  Objects  of  Worship %0ain  the  Temple  of  Venus  of  the  Gnidians. %0a%0aTrebius  Niger  saith  that  the  Echeneis  is  a  Foot  long,  and %0afive  Fingers  thick  ;  that  it  hinders  the  Progress  of  a  Ship ; %0a%0a1  The  proper  Echeneis  is  the  E.  remora.  Linn.;  but  from  its  pos- %0asessing similar,  or  even  firmer  powers  of  adhesion,  though  by  a  different %0aorgan,  it  was  confounded  with  the  larger  Lamprey,  Petrornyzon  marinus. %0aFrom  allusion  to  the  feet,  Aristotle,  as  well  as  Gesner,  who  follows  him, %0aappears  to  include  in  the  same  class  a  species  of  Cyclopterus ;  of  which %0athere  is  one  that  adheres  with  more  facility,  although  with  less  firmness. %0aWe  cannot  avoid  believing  that  the  popular  impression  concerning  this %0afish  was  often  laid  hold  of  as  an  excuse,  in  some  of  the  instances  where  an %0aunpleasant  task  had  been  slowly  performed  or  entirely  counteracted.  The %0anarrative  of  Antony's  delay  at  the  battle  of  Actium  (see  B.  xxxii.  c.  1 .) %0awill  only  excite  a  smile  in  those  who  consider  the  much  more  formidable %0aattraction  that  existed  at  the  time.  — Wern.

Of  them  there  are  three  Sorts.  First,  those  which %0aare  called  Soft :  secondly,  such  as  are  covered  with  thin %0aCrusts :  and  in  the  last  Place,  they  that  are  enclosed  within %0ahard  Shells.  The  soft  are  reckoned  the  Loligo,  Sepia,  Poly- %0apus, and  the  rest  of  that  Sort.  These  have  their  Head  between %0atheir  Feet  and  the  Belly,  and  every  one  of  them  has  eight %0aFeet.  The  Sepia  and  Loligo  have  each  two  Feet,  very  long %0aand  rough ;  by  which  they  convey  Meat  to  their  Mouths : %0aand  also  stay  themselves  as  with  an  Anchor  against  the %0aWaves.  The  rest  of  their  Feet  are  Tendrils,  with  which  they %0acatch  their  Prey. %0a%0aCHAPTER  XXIX.2 %0aOf  the  Loligo,3  Sepia,4*  Polypus,5  and  Nautilus? %0a%0aALSO  the  Loligo  flies,  springing  out  of  the  Water  as  if %0ahe  were  an  Arrow ;  and  even  Pectunculi  do  the  same.

The  story  of  hoisting  its  membranous %0asails  to  the  wind  is  found  to  be  an  error :  the  use  of  these  parts  being  to %0aclasp  the  sides  of  the  shell  as  it  swims.    It  was  the  Polypus  chiefly  that %0awas  so  highly  prized  as  food  by  the  Greeks,  but  it  was  necessary  to  bruise %0ait  well  before  it  was  cooked.    The  Loligo  was  also  employed  in  the  same %0amanner ;  as  it  is  at  this  day.  —  Wern.  Club. %0a%0a%0aBOOK  IX.]  History  of  Nature.  143 %0a%0aMales  of  the  Sepia  kind  are  mottled,  and  blacker,  as  well  as %0amore  firm,  than  the  Female.  If  the  Female  be  smitten  with %0aa  Trident,  they  will  help  her  ;  but  if  the  Male  be  struck,  she %0aflies.  But  both  of  them,  when  they  perceive  that  they  are %0alaid  hold  of,  throw  out  a  Quantity  of  Ink,  which  is  in  the %0aPlace  of  Blood  to  them  ;  and  when  the  Water  is  obscured %0awith  it  they  hide  themselves  by  means  of  it. %0a%0aOf  Polypi  there  are  many  Kinds.  They  that  keep  near %0athe  Shore  are  bigger  than  those  that  haunt  the  Deep.  All %0aof  them  employ  their  Arms  in  the  manner  of  Feet  and %0aHands ;  but  the  Tail,  which  is  sharp  and  two-forked,  serveth %0athem  in  their  Coupling.  The  Polypi  have  a  Pipe  in  their %0aBack,  by  which  they  throw  out  the  Sea :  and  it  they  can %0ashift,  one  while  to  the  right  Side,  and  another  to  the  left. %0aThey  swim  obliquely  on  their  Head,  which  is  very  hard  by %0abeing  blown  up  while  they  are  alive.  Moreover,  by  hollow %0aConcavities,  arranged  along  their  Arms,  they  will  adhere,  as %0ait  were  by  sucking,  to  any  Thing ;  which  they  hold  so  fast %0a(lying  upward  with  their  Bellies)  that  they  cannot  be %0aplucked  from  it.  They  never  fasten  on  the  Bottom;  and %0athe  greater  they  are,  the  less  strong  they  are  to  hold  any %0aThing.  Of  all  soft  (Fishes)  they  alone  go  out  of  the  Water  to %0adry  Land,  at  least  into  some  rough  Place;  for  they  cannot %0aabide  those  that  are  smooth.  They  devour  the  Flesh  of  Shell- %0afishes, the  Shells  of  which  they  break  by  the  Compression  of %0atheir  Tendrils  ;  and  therefore  the  Place  where  they  lie  may %0abe  detected  by  the  Number  of  Shells  that  lie  before  their %0aPlace.  And  though  in  other  Respects  it  may  be  regarded  as %0aa  very  senseless  Creature,  so  that  it  will  swim  to  a  Man's %0aHand,  yet  in  what  concerns  its  Family  Affairs  it  possesses %0aUnderstanding:  for  all  they  can  take  they  carry  to  their %0aHome ;  and  when  they  have  eaten  the  Meat  of  the  Tishes %0athey  throw  away  the  empty  Shells,  and  watch  to  catch  the %0alittle  Fishes  that  approach  them.  They  change  their  Colour %0ato  that  of  the  Place  where  they  are,  and  especially  when %0aunder  the  Influence  of  Fear.  That  they  gnaw  their  own %0aArms  is  a  great  Error;  for  they  owe  this  Injury  to  the  Con- %0agers :  but  it  is  scarcely  false  that  they  will  grow  again,  like %0a%0a%0a144  History  of  Nature.  [BoOK  IX. %0a%0athe  Tail  of  Adders  and  Lizards.  But  among  the  greatest %0aWonders  of  Nature,  is  that  Creature  which  by  some  is  called %0aNautilos,  by  others  Pompilos.  It  comes  to  the  Surface  of %0athe  Water  upon  its  Back,  so  that  it  raiseth  or  heaveth  itself %0aup  by  little  and  little ;  and  that  it  may  swim  with  Ease,  it %0adischargeth  all  the  Water  through  a  Pipe,  as  if  it  were %0aunloaded  by  a  Pump,  After  this,  turning  back  the  two  fore- %0amost Arms,  it  stretcheth  out  between  them  a  Membrane  of %0awonderful  thinness ;  which  serve th  it  for  a  Sail  in  the  Air, %0awhilst  with  the  rest  of  its  Arms  it  roweth  under  Water ;  and %0awith  the  Tail  in  the  midst  it  directeth  its  Course,  as  with  an %0aHelm.  Thus  does  it  make  its  Way  in  the  Deep  with  the %0aImitation  of  a  little  Boat,  and  if  any  Thing  alarm  it  with  a %0aDraught  of  Water  it  sinks  itself  to  the  Bottom. %0a%0aCHAPTER  XXX. %0a%0aOf  the  Ozcena,  the  Nauplius,  and  Locustce. %0a%0aTHE  Ozsena1  is  a  kind  of  Polypus,  and  it  derives  its  Name %0afrom  the  strong  Smell  of  its  Head  ;  from  which  Cause  espe- %0acially the  Mursenae  pursue  it.  The  Polypi  lie  hid  for  two %0aMonths,  and  do  not  live  above  two  Years.  They  always  die %0aof  a  Consumption  :  the  Female  sooner  than  the  Males,  and %0aordinarily  after  they  have  brought  forth  their  Young.  I %0acannot  pass  over  the  Reports  of  Trebius  Niger,  one  of  the %0aRetinue  of  L.  Lucullus,  Proconsul  in  Boetica,  which  he  deli- %0avered as  collected  by  the  latter  concerning  these  Polypi : %0athat  they  are  exceedingly  greedy  after  Conchaj  (Cockles, %0aMussels,  and  such-like  Shell-fishes) :  and  that  they,  as  soon %0aas  they  feel  themselves  touched,  shut  their  Shells,  and  so  cut %0aoff  their  Arms,  and  thus  feed  upon  those  which  sought  to %0amake  a  Prey  of  them.  These  Shell-fishes  are  without  Sight, %0aand  every  other  Sense,  but  those  of  tasting  their  Meat %0aand  Sensibility  to  Danger.  These  Polypi  lie  in  wait  for %0aCockles  as  they  gape  wide  open,  and  put  in  a  little  Stone %0a%0a1  Eledone  moschatus.  —  Cuv.

Moreover,  Trebius  Niger  affirmeth  that  there %0ais  no  other  Creature  so  dangerous  to  destroy  a  Man  in  the %0aWater ;  for  it  catcheth  him  fast  in  its  Embrace,  and  sucks %0ahim  with  the  Cups,  so  that  it  exhausts  him  with  the  Num- %0aber of  its  drawing  Instruments,  at  such  a  Time  as  it  has %0aobtained  an  Advantage  over  those  which  are  shipwrecked, %0aor  are  engaged  in  diving.  But  if  it  be  turned  upside  down, %0aits  Strength  is  soon  gone  ;  for  then  they  stretch  themselves %0aout  on  their  Back.  And  truly  also,  all  Creatures  in  the %0aSea  are  attracted  by  their  Smell,  which  is  the  Cause  that %0aFishermen  besmear  their  Traps  with  them. %0a%0aOther  Things  which  this  Author  hath  related  may  seem %0arather  like  something  monstrous  ;  for  he  affirmeth,  that  at %0aCarteia  there  was  one  which  used  to  go  from  the  Sea  into %0atheir  open  Cisterns,  among  their  Ponds,  and  there  rob  them %0aof  their  salt  Fish ;  and  this  Thievery  was  so  enormous  and %0along  continued,  that  it  gat  itself  the  great  Displeasure  of %0athe  Keepers.  Fences  were  erected  to  stop  the  Passage,  but %0athese  it  passed  over  by  means  of  a  Tree  ;  nor  could  it  have %0abeen  taken  but  by  the  Sagacity  of  the  Dogs  :  for  as  it  was %0areturning  one  Night,  they  set  upon  it  on  all  Sides,  and  so %0araised  the  Keepers,  who  were  affrighted  at  the  strange %0aSight.  For,  first  of  all,  it  was  of  unheard-of  bigness;  then %0aits  Colour  was  covered  over  with  the  Pickle,  and  the  Stink %0awas  horrible.  Who  would  have  looked  for  a  Polypus  there, %0aor  have  known  it  in  such  a  condition  ?  They  thought  they %0ahad  to  encounter  with  some  Monster :  for  with  its  terrible %0aVapour  it  drove  away  the  Dogs;  and  with  the  Ends  of  its %0along  Tendrils  it  would  lash  them ;  sometimes  with  its %0astronger  Arms  it  knocked  them,  as  with  Clubs  ;  so  that  it %0awas  with  Difficulty  they  were  able  to  kill  it  with  several %0athree-pronged  Spears.

The %0aCavities  or  Cups,  and  hollow  Vessels,  were  like  great %0aBasins ;  and  the  Teeth  were  conspicuous  for  their  size.  The %0aRemains  were  preserved  for  a  Wonder,  and  weighed  seven %0ahundred  Pounds.  The  same  Author  affirmeth  that  Sepiae %0aalso,  and  the  Loligo,  have  been  cast  upon  that  Shore,  full  as %0abig.  Indeed,  in  our  Sea,  Loligines  are  taken  of  five  Cubits %0along,  and  Sepiae  of  two :  and  these  do  not  live  above  two %0aYears.1 %0a%0aMutianus  reporteth,  that  himself  saw  in  Propontis  ano- %0ather kind,  having  the  Likeness  of  one  carrying  a  Ship  :  that %0ait  was  a  Shell-fish,  with  a  Keel  like  that  of  a  Barge,  with  a %0aPoop  turned  inward  ;  the  Prow  with  a  Beak.  Within  this %0alay  hid  the  Nauplius,  an  Animal  resembling  a  Sepia,  only  to %0aplay  with  it  for  Company.  And  this  was  done  in  two  Ways : %0afor  when  it  is  calm,  the  Passenger  would  put  down  its  Feet, %0aand  row  as  with  Oars ;  but  if  the  Breeze  invited,  it  would %0astretch  out  the  same  to  serve  for  a  Rudder  ;  and  then  the %0aCavity  of  the  Shell  would  be  spread  to  the  Wind.  So  one  of %0athem  takes,  a  Pleasure  to  carry,  and  the  other  to  direct;  and %0athey  unite  to  sink  the  Shell  :  though  both  are  destitute  of %0aSense  ;  unless,  indeed,  Misfortune  be  intended  to  Man  :  a %0asad  Presage,  as  is  well  known  to  Sailors. %0a%0aLocustae2  (being  of  that  Kind  which  wanteth  Blood)  are %0adefended  with  a  brittle  Crust.

Of  Crabs  there  are  many %0akinds  :  as  Carabi,  Astaci,  Majae,  Paguri,  Heracleotici, %0aLeones,  and  others  that  are  less  esteemed.  The  Carabi %0adiffer  from  other  Crabs  in  the  Tail.  In  Phoenicia  there  is  a %0akind  called  Hippoe,  which  are  so  swifr,  that  it  is  impossible %0ato  overtake  them.  Crabs  live  long  :  they  have  eight  Feet, %0aall  turned  obliquely  :  the  Female  hath  the  Fore-foot  double, %0athe  Male  single.  Moreover,  two  of  their  Arms  have  toothed %0aPincers.  The  upper  Part  of  these  Fore-claws  is  moveable  ; %0athe  lower  Part  doth  not  move.  The  right  Ann  in  all  is  the %0alarger.  When  they  come  in  Sculls  together,  sometimes %0athey  are  not  able  to  pass  the  Mouth  of  the  Pontus  ;  for %0awhich  Reason  they  return  and  fetch  a  Compass,  so  that  the %0abeaten  Way  may  be  seen.  The  least  of  all  these  kind  of %0aCrabs  is  called  Pinnotheres1 ;  and  on  this  Account  it  is  the %0amost  exposed  to  Injury.  But  it  possesses  the  Wisdom  to %0ahide  itself  within  the  Shells  of  empty  Oysters  ;  and  as  it %0agroweth  bigger,  it  changes  its  Quarters  to  larger  ones. %0aCrabs,  when  they  are  afraid,  will  run  backward  as  fast  as %0athey  went  forward.  They  fight  with  one  another,  and  then %0abutt  with  their  Horns  like  Rams.  They  are  a  Remedy %0aagainst  the  Stings  of  Serpents.  It  is  reported,  that  while  the %0aSun  is  passing  the  Sign  Cancer,  the  Bodies  of  dead  Crabs %0athat  lie  on  the  dry  Land  are  turned  into  Scorpions.  Of  the %0asame  Class  are  the  Echini  ;2  which  have  Spines  instead  of %0aFeet.  Their  Manner  of  going  is  to  roll  themselves  round; %0aand,  therefore,  many  Times  they  are  found  with  their  Spines %0arubbed  off.  Of  the  same  Sort  are  those  which  are  called %0aEchinometrse,  which  have  the  longest  Spines  and  the %0asmallest  Cases.  Neither  are  they  alt  of  the  same  glassy %0aColour;  for  those  produced  about Torone  are  white,  and  have %0a%0a1  Or  Pinnoteres. %0a%0aa  Professor  Edward  Forbes  believes  the  species  intended  by  Pliny  to %0abe  E.  limdusj  and  Echinometra,  Echinus  esculentus.  But  in  regard  to %0athe  latter  there  is  some  doubt.  Ruysch  represents  it  as  having  a  small %0acup  and  long  spines.  One  that  is  elongated,  with  soft,  weak  spines,  is %0aAmphidelus  Mediterraneus  ;  and  a  little  species  with  long  spines,  Cidaris %0ahistrix.

It  is  said  that  they  foretell  the %0araging  of  the  Sea :  for  they  labour  to  gather  Stones,  by  the %0aWeight  of  which  to  fix  themselves  from  being  rolled  over: %0afor  they  dread  to  have  their  Spines  worn  off  by  being %0atossed  about ;  and  when  the  Sailors  have  seen  this,  they %0aimmediately  moor  their  Ships  with  many  Anchors. %0a%0aCHAPTER  XXXII. %0aOf  Cochlea.1 %0a%0aIN  the  same  Rank  are  the  Cochleae,  both  of  the  Land %0aand  Water ;  which  stretch  themselves  out  of  their  Habi- %0atation, and  extend  or  withdraw  two  Horns.

But %0awe  are  not  contented  to  be  fed  with  so  many  Perils,  we  must %0abe  clad  with  them  also.  So  throughout  the  whole  Body, %0athat  which  is  obtained  with  the  utmost  Hazard  is  most %0aregarded  by  the  Mind  of  Man.  The  principal  and  summit %0aof  all  these  Things,  as  regards  the  Price,1  are  Pearls.  The %0aIndian  Ocean  sends  the  chief  Supply  :  and  they  are  searched %0afor  amongst  those  many  and  terrible  Beasts  which  we  have %0aspoken  of  before  ;2  we  must  pass  over  so  many  Seas,  through %0aso  great  an  Extent  of  Countries,  where  the  Heat  of  the  Sun %0ais  excessive  :  even  the  Indians  themselves  go  to  seek  them %0aamong  the  Islands,  and  even  then  meet  with  very  few.  The %0agreatest  Plenty  is  found  in  Taprobane  and  Toidis,  as  hath %0abeen  said  in  our  Review  of  the  World  :  and  likewise  about %0aPerimula,  a  Promontory  of  India.  But  they  are  praised  as %0athe  most  perfect,  which  are  obtained  about  Arabia,  within %0athe  Persian  Gulf  of  the  Red  Sea.  The  Origin  and  Mode  of %0abreeding  of  this  Shell  differ  not  much  from  that  of  the %0aShells  of  Oysters :  for  when  the  Season  of  the  Year  urgeth %0athem,  they  spread  themselves  with  a  Kind  of  Gaping,  and %0athen  are  said  to  be  filled  with  a  prolific  Dew,  with  which %0athey  grow  pregnant :  and  the  Fruit  of  which  these  Shell- %0afishes are  delivered  are  these  Pearls,  according  to  the  Qua- %0ality of  the  Dew  which  they  received.  For  if  the  Dew  were %0apure  which  went  into  them,  the  Pearls  are  white  and  bril- %0aliant ;  if  muddy,  the  Product  likewise  is  foul  :  it  is  pale, %0aalso,  if  the  Weather  were  threatening  at  the  Time  of  Con- %0aception. Whereby,  no  doubt,  it  is  plain  that  they  have  more %0aAffinity  with  the  Sky  than  with  the  Sea :  for,  according  as %0athe  Morning  is  fair,  they  are  clear ;  or  foul,  if  that  was %0acloudy.  If  they  have  Time  to  feed  sufficiently,  the  Pearls, %0aalso,  will  grow  large  ;  but  if  there  be  Lightning,  they  close %0a%0a1  At  the  opening  of  the  4th  chapter  of  the  37th  Book,  our  author  tells %0aus  that  diamonds  bear  the  highest  price.  —  Wern.

I %0awonder  that  they  so  greatly  rejoice  in  the  Air;  for  with  the %0aSun  they  become  red,  and  lose  their  Whiteness,  just  like  the %0aBody  of  a  Man.  Therefore  those  Shells  that  keep  in  the %0amain  Sea,  and  lie  deeper  than  the  Sunbeams  can  pierce  to %0athem,  have  the  finest  Pearls.  And  even  these  become  yellow %0awith  Age,  and  dull  with  Wrinkles;  so  that  the  Lustre  which %0ais  so  much  sought  for,  only  continued!  during  their  Youth. %0aWhen  they  are  old,  they  grow  thick,  and  stick  fast  to  the %0aShells,  so  that  they  cannot  be  separated  but  with  a  File. %0aThese  have  only  one  Face,  and  from  that  Side  are  round  ; %0afor  the  back  Part  is  flat ;  for  which  Reason  such  are  called %0aTympania.  We  may  see  them  growing  together  in  these %0aShells  which  serve  to  carry  Ointments.1  There  is  a  Pearl %0athat,  is  soft  when  in  the  Water,  but  when  taken  out  it  pre- %0asently hardeneth.  When  this  Shell  perceiveth  the  Hand, %0ait  shutteth  itself,  and  so  covereth  over  her  Riches,  being %0aaware  that  it  is  for  these  she  is  sought  after.  But  if  the %0aHand  come  in  the  Way  of  the  Shell,  it  will  be  cut  off  by  its %0asharp  Edge  ;  and  the  Punishment  cannot  be  more  just, %0aalthough  she  is  armed  with  other  Means  of  Revenge.

There  is  Luxury %0aconveyed  in  the  Names  they  have  devised  for  these,  and %0awanton  Excess  in  what  they  carry  about;  for  when  they %0aknock  one  against  another  they  call  them  Crotalia  (Cym- %0abals), as  if  they  delighted  to  hear  the  Sound  of  their  Pearls %0arattling  together.

For  it  is  not  enough  to  carry %0aPearls  about  with  them,  but  they  must  tread  upon  them,  and %0aeven  walk  among  Pearls. %0a%0aPearls  were  accustomed  to  be  found  in  our  Seas,  and %0amore  abundantly  about  the  Thracian  Bosphorus  ;  but  they %0awere  small  and  ruddy  in  the  Shells,  which  they  call  Myse  :l %0aIn  Acarnania  the  Shell  called  Pinna1  produceth  them. %0aWhereby  it  appeareth  that  they  are  bred  in  more  than  one %0aSort  of  Concha.  King  Juba,  also,  hath  recorded,  that  on %0athe  Arabian  Coasts  there  is  a  Kind  of  Shell  like  a  notched %0aPecten,  but  rough,  something  like  the  Echinus ;  and  this %0abeareth  Pearls  in  the  Flesh  like  a  Hailstone.

The %0aValue  of  these  Ornaments  she  rated  at  400  hundred  thousand %0aSestertii  ;l  and  offered  to  prove  it  immediately  by  her  Books %0aof  Accounts.

This  is %0athe  Issue  of  those  Depredations  ;  this  it  was  for  which %0aM.

[BooK  IX . %0a%0aWagers  were,  therefore,  laid  ;  and  on  the  following  Day, %0awhen  the  Decision  was  to  be  made  (for  that  a  Day  might %0anot  be  lost,  Antony  appointed  the  next  succeeding  one),  she %0aprovided  a  Supper,  which  was,  on  the  whole,  sumptuous ; %0abut  Antony  laughed  at  it,  and  required  to  see  an  Account  of %0athe  Particulars.  But  she  said,  that  what  had  been  served  up %0aalready  was  but  the  Over-measure,  and  affirmed  still,  that %0ashe  would  in  that  Supper  make  up  the  full  Sum ;  and  her- %0aself alone  consume  in  this  Supper  600  huudred  thousand %0aSestertii.1  She  then  commanded  the  second  Table  to  be %0abrought  in.  As  soon  as  the  Order  was  given,  the  Attendants %0aplaced  before  her  one  only  Vessel  of  Vinegar,2  the  Strength %0aand  Sharpness  of  which  wasted  and  dissolved  the  Pearls. %0aNow  she  wore  at  her  Ears  that  most  remarkable  and  truly %0asingular  Work  of  Nature.  Therefore,  as  Antony  waited  to %0asee  what  she  was  going  to  do,  she  took  one  of  them  from %0aher  Ear,  steeped  it  in  the  Vinegar,  and  when  it  was  liquefied, %0adrank  it.  As  she  was  about  to  do  the  like  by  the  other, %0aL.  Plancius,  the  Judge  of  that  Wager,  laid  hold  upon  it %0awith  his  Hand,  and  pronounced  that  Antony  had  lost  the %0aWager :  whereat  the  Man  became  very  angry.  The  Fame %0aof  this  Pearl  may  go  with  its  Fellow  ;  for  after  this  Queen, %0athe  Winner  of  so  great  a  Wager,  was  taken  Prisoner,  the %0aother  Pearl  was  cut  in  two,  that  the  half  of  their  Supper %0amight  hang  at  the  Ears  of  Venus,  in  the  Pantheon,  at %0aRome.  Still,  however,  these  shall  not  bear  away  the  Palm  in %0a%0a1  Sixty  millions. %0a%0a2  Cleopatra  must  have  employed  a  stronger  vinegar  than  that  which %0awe  now  use  for  our  tables,  as  the  pearls,  on  account  of  their  hardness  and %0atheir  natural  enamel,  cannot  be  easily  dissolved  by  a  weak  acid.   Nature  has %0asecured  the  teeth  of  animals  against  the  effect  of  acids,  by  an  enamel %0acovering  of  the  like  kind  ;  but  if  this  enamel  happen  to  be  injured  only %0ain  one  small  place,  the  teeth  soon  spoil  and  rot.     Cleopatra,  perhaps, %0abroke  and  pounded  the  pearls ;  and  it  is  probable  that  she  afterwards %0adiluted  the  vinegar  with  water,  that  she   might  be  able  to  drink  it ; %0athough  it  is  the  nature  of  the  basis  or  calx  to  neutralise  the  acid,  and  so %0arender  it  imperceptible  to  the  tongue. — See  BECKMAN'S  Hist,  of  Inventions, %0avol.  ii.  p.  1. %0a%0aThe  pearl  which  Cleopatra  swallowed  is  said  to  have  been  worth %0a80,729*.  3s.  4d.  —  Wern.

For %0abefore  this,  Ctodius,  the  Son  of  JEsop?  the  Tragedian,  being %0aleft  by  him  Heir  to  very  great  Wealth,  practised  the  same %0awith  Pearls  of  great  Price ;  so  that  Antony  needed  not  to  be %0aover-proud  of  his  Triumvirate,  being  almost  equalled  by  a %0aStage-player ;  and  that,  too,  when  he  was  not  urged  to  it  by %0aa  Wager,  which  was  much  more  like  a  King.  His  Experi- %0ament was  the  Glory  of  the  Palate,  for  he  wanted  to  try %0awhat  Taste  Pearls  had ;  and  as  they  pleased  him  wonder- %0afully, because  he  would  not  be  the  only  one  who  knew  the %0aTaste,  he  gave  to  every  Guest  at  his  Table  a  Pearl  to  sup  up %0ain  like  Mariner. %0a%0aFenestdla  writeth,  that  after  Alexandria  was  reduced  to %0aSubjection,  Pearls  came  into  frequent  and  indiscriminate  use %0aat  Rome ;  but  that  about  the  Time  of  Sylla  they  began  first; %0aand  those  were  but  small  ones,  and  mean.

They %0alie  hid  for  thirty  Days  about  the  rising  of  the  Dog  Star,  like %0athe  Murices.  They  collect  together  in  the  Spring,  and  with %0arubbing  one  against  another  they  spit  a  clammy  Substance, %0ain  the  Manner  of  Wax.  The  Murices  do  the  like.  But  that %0aBloom  which  is  so  much  in  request  for  dyeing  Garments  the %0aPurpurse  have  in  the  midst  of  their  Throat.  Here  is  placed %0aa  white  Vein,  containing  a  very  little  Fluid ;  from  whence %0ais  derived  that  precious  and  bright  Colour  of  deep  red %0a(Nigrantis)  Roses.  The  Rest  of  the  Body  yieldeth  Nothing. %0aFishermen  endeavour  to  take  them  alive,  for  when  they  die %0athey  cast  up  that  Juice  with  their  Life.  Now  the  Tyrians, %0awhen  they  obtain  any  great  Purpurse,  remove  the  Shell  from %0athe  Flesh  ;  but  the  lesser,  they  break  in  a  Mill,  and  so  at %0alast  collect  that  Humour.  This  is  the  best  in  Asia  ;  but  in %0aAfrica,  that  in  the  (Island)  Meninx,  and  the  Coast  of  the %0aOcean  by  Getulia  ;  and  in  Europe,  that  o^f  Laconica.  It  is %0afor  this  the  Roman  Fasces  and  Axes  make  Way  ;  this  is  it %0athat  stands  for  the  Majesty  of  the  Childhood;  this  maketh %0athe  Distinction  between  the  Senate  and  a  Knight ;  this  is %0asummoned  when  they  offer  Sacrifice  to  pacify  the  Gods :  this %0agiveth  a  Lustre  to  every  Garment ;  and  in  their  triumphal %0aProcession  it  is  interlaced  with  the  Gold.  It  is  thus  that  the %0aMadness  after  the  Purpurse  is  to  be  excused.  But  how %0ashould  the  Conchylia  be  so  highly  prized?  What  strong %0aSmell  in  the  rank  Colour,  so  harsh  a  Colour  in  the  blue, %0aand  resembling  rather  the  angry  Sea?  But  to  come  to  the %0aparticular  Description.  The  Purpura  hath  a  Tongue  the %0alength  of  a  Finger,  so  sharp  and  hard  at  the  End  that  it %0apierces  into  other  Shell-fishes,  and  feeds  on  them.  In  fresh %0a%0a1  This  name  included  more  than  one  species ;  but  more  particularly  it %0ais  the  Murex  trunculus,  Guv.  Conchylia :  a  name  for  Bivalve  shells  in %0ageneral.

All  Shell-fish  grow  very %0arapidly,  but  Purpurse  remarkably  so ;  for  in  one  Year  they %0acome  to  their  full  Size.  Now  if  I  should  proceed  no  further, %0aLuxury  would  think  itself  defrauded,  and  condemn  me  for %0aNegligence.  Therefore  we  will  follow  the  Subject  into  the %0aShops,  that  as  every  Man  for  the  Necessity  of  this  Life %0aknoweth  the  Price  of  Victuals,  all  who  take  Pleasure  in %0athese  Things  may  be  well  versed  in  the  Costs  of  this  their %0aExistence.  These  Shell-fishes  that  serve  for  purple  Colours, %0aand  the  Conchylia,  all  consist  of  one  Material :  the  Differ- %0aence is  only  in  the  mixing.  They  are  of  two  principal  Sorts. %0aThe  Buccinum  is  a  smaller  Shell,  resembling  that  Horn  with %0awhich  Sound  is  uttered  ;  and  from  this  it  took  its  Name. %0aThe  round  Orifice  is  cut  in  at  the  Edges.  The  other  is %0anamed  Purpura,  protrudes  a  long  Snout  like  a  Channel,  and %0awithin  the  Side  of  this  Channel  it  is  tubulated,  to  allow  a %0aPassage  for  the  Tongue.  Besides  this  the  Shell  is  studded  as %0afar  as  to  the  Wreathe  with  sharp  Spines,  in  about  seven %0aRows,  placed  in  a  Circle;  which  the  Buccinum  doth  not %0apossess.  But  so  many  Circles  as  each  of  them  has,  so %0amany  Years  old  they  are.  The  Buccinum  fastens  to  Nothing %0abesides  Rocks,  and  therefore  is  gathered  about  rough %0aPlaces. %0a%0aCHAPTER  XXXVII. %0aHow  many  Sorts  there  are. %0a%0aPuRPUR2E  have  another  Name,  and  are  called  Pelagiae. %0aThere  are  many  Sorts  of  them,  which  differ  either  in  their %0aSituation  or  Food.  The  first  is  the  Lutense,  nourished  by %0arotten  Mud  :  the  Algense,  the  worst  of  all,  feeding  upon  Sea- %0aweeds close  to  the  Shore ;  and  the  Taeniens^,  which  is  better %0athan  either  of  the  former,  and  is  gathered  about  the  Borders %0aof  the  Sea  called  Tenci.  And  yet  this  Kind  yieideth  only  a %0alight  and  diluted  Colour.  There  are  also  some  termed  Cal- %0aculosae,  from  the  Sea-gravel,  which  is  wonderfully  good  for %0a%0a%0a160  History  of  Nature.  [BooK  IX. %0a%0aConchylia.  And  by  far  the  best,  the  Purpurae  dialutense, %0athat  is,  a  Kind  which  is  fed  by  various  Kinds  of  Soil.  Now %0athese  Purpurae  are  taken  with  very  small  Snares,  like  Nets, %0athrown  into  deep  Water.  Within  these,  for  a  Bait,  are  some %0aShells,  that  will  shut,  and  are  ready  to  snap,  as  we  may %0asee  the  Mituli.  These,  when  half  dead,  are  put  back  into %0athe  Sea,  when  reviving  and  gaping  for  Water,  the  Purpurae %0aeagerly  seek  for  them  with  their  pointed  Tongues,  which %0athey  thrust  out  and  so  annoy  them  :  but  the  others,  feeling %0athemselves  pricked,  presently  shut  their  Shells  together,  and %0acompress  those  that  bite  them.  Thus  the  Purpurae,  through %0atheir  Greediness,  are  taken,  hanging  by  their  Tongues. %0a%0aCHAPTER  XXXVIII. %0aThe  Fishing -time  for  Pur  puree. %0a%0aTHE  best  Time  to  take  Purpurae  is  after  the  Dog-Star  is %0arisen,  or  before  the  Spring.  For,  when  they  have  borne %0aYoung  their  Juice  is  waterish.  But  the  Shops  of  the %0aDyers  do  not  know  this,  although  their  highest  Skill  turns %0aon  this  Point.  When  they  are  caught  they  extract  the %0aVein  before-mentioned  ;  and  they  lay  it  in  the  necessary %0aSalt,  in  the  Proportion  of  a  Pint  and  half  (of  Salt)  to  every %0aHundred-weight.  It  is  right  to  soak  it  for  about  three  Days, %0afor  the  newer  the  Colour  is,  so  much  is  it  stronger.  They %0aheat  it  in  Lead,  and  to  every  Amphora  of  Water1  they  put %0aone  hundred  and  fifty  Pounds  of  the  Colour  so  prepared. %0aThey  boil  it  with  a  gentle  Fire,  and  therefore  the  Pipe  must %0alead  a  good  WTay  off  from  the  Furnace.  During  this  Time,  the %0aFlesh  being  now  and  then  skimmed  off  (for  some  of  this  can- %0anot be  prevented  from  sticking  to  the  Veins),  for  the  most %0aPart  about  the  tenth  Day  the  Kettle  is  sufficiently  pre- %0apared ;  and  to  make  Trial  of  it,  they  dip  into  it  a  Fleece  of %0aWool  that  has  been  washed  out  of  one  Water  into  another  : %0aand  until  their  Wish  is  satisfied,  they  persist  in  trying  the %0aLiquor.  The  red  Colour  is  worse  than  that  which  is  dark. %0a%0a1  See  Chap,  xxxix.  —  Wern.  Club. %0a%0a%0aBOOK  IX.]  History  of  Nature.  161 %0a%0aThe  Wool  absorbs  the  Colour  in  five  Hours :  then  they  card %0ait,  and  put  it  in  again,  until  it  hath  drunk  up  all  the  colour- %0aing Matter.  The  Buccinum  maketh  no  good  Colour  of  itself; %0afor  it  loses  the  Dye  again.  And,  therefore,  usually  they  join %0ato  it  the  Pelagium  ;  which,  to  its  too  great  Blackness,  giveth %0athat  Depth  and  Brightness  which  is  sought  for  in  Cloth  dyed %0ain  Grain.  Thus  by  mixing  the  Force  of  both  they  raise  one %0aanother,  or  bind  each  other  more  closely.  The  amount  of %0athe  Preparation  to  each  Pound  of  Wool  is  two  hundred  of %0athe  Buccinum  to  a  hundred  and  eleven  Pelagian  Purpurse. %0aIn  this  Manner  is  made  that  rich  Amethyst  Colour.  But  the %0aTyrians  thoroughly  dye  the  Wool  in  the  Furnace  of  the %0aPelagian  Purpurae  only,  while  not  yet  thoroughly  prepared, %0abut  still  green  ;  and  afterwards  they  change  it  into  another, %0awhere  the  Buccinum  has  been  boiled.  It  is  most  highly %0acommended  when  it  is  as  deep  a  red  as  congealed  Blood ; %0ablackish  at  the  first  Sight,  but  when  viewed  between  you %0aand  the  Light,  it  shows  a  shining  Lustre.  And  hereupon  it %0ais  that  Homer  calleth  Blood  Purple. %0a%0aCHAPTER  XXXIX. %0aWhen  they  began  at  Rome  to  wear  Purple. %0a%0aI  SEE  that  Purple  hath  been  always  used  in  Rome  ;  but %0aRomulus  wore  it  in  his  royal  Robe  (only).  It  is  well  known %0athat  Tullus  Hostilius  was  the  first  of  the  Kings  who,  after  he %0ahad  subdued  the  Hetruscans,  put  on  the  Toga  Pretexta  and %0athe  Latus  Clavus.  JVepos  Cornelius,  who  died  under  the %0aReign  of  Divus  Augustus,  says:  When  I  was  a  young  Man, %0athe  Violet  Purple  was  in  great  Request,  and  a  Pound  of  it %0awas  sold  for  a  hundred  Denarii  i1  and  not  long  after  the %0aTarentine  red  Purple.  After  this  came  the  double-dyed %0aTyrian  Purple,  which  could  not  be  bought  for  a  thousand %0aPounds  of  Denarii.2  P.  Lentulus  Spinter,  in  his  Curile %0a^Edileship,  is  reproached  for  having  first  worn  it  in  his  Robe. %0aBut  now  (says  Nepos},  who  does  not  form  the  Hangings  of %0a%0a1  3  lib.  2  shil.  6d.  sterl.  *  31  lib.  5  shil. %0a%0aVOL.

Spinier  was  ^Edile  in  the  seven %0ahundredth  Year  after  the  Foundation  of  the  City,  when  Cicero %0awas  Consul.  This  Purple  was  then  called  Dibapha,  which %0awas  twice  dyed  ;  as  being  of  magnificent  Expense ;  whereas %0anow  almost  all  the  genteel  Purple  Cloths  are  thus  dyed.  In %0athe  Cloths  dyed  with  the  Conchylia  the  other  Things  are %0athe  same,  except  that  there  is  no  Buccinum.  Moreover,  the %0aBroth  is  tempered  with  Water  instead  of  the  Excrement  of %0aa  Man's  Drink;  and  only  a  half  of  the  Preparations  is %0aadded.  And  thus  is  made  that  pale  Tint  so  highly  com- %0amended, as  being  deprived  of  the  full  Colour ;  and  it  is  so %0amuch  the  more  diluted,  as  the  Wool  has  been  suffered  to %0adrink  it  up. %0a%0aCHAPTER  XL. %0aThe  Prices  of  these  Cloths. %0a%0aTHE  Prices  are  lower,  according  to  the  Abundance  of  the %0adyeing  Material  found  on  the  Coast.  But  it  was  never  known %0ain  any  Place  that  a  Pound  of  the  Pelagian  (Colour)  has  ex- %0aceeded five  hundred  Sesterces  : t  nor  a  Pound  of  the  Buc- %0acinum (Purple)  cost  above  one  hundred  :  which  they  who %0asell  these  Things  raise  to  an  extravagant  Price.  But  this  is %0afar  from  being  the  End  ;  and  Men  have  a  Delight  to  trifle %0awith  the  Expense :  to  deceive  by  mixing  over  again,  and  so %0adouble  the  Produce,  adulterating  even  the  Adulterations  of %0aNature;  as  to  stain  the  Tortoise,  to  mix  Silver  with  the  Gold, %0aand  so  form  Electrum  :  and  by  adding  Brass  to  these,  to %0amake  the  Corinthian  Metal. %0a%0aCHAPTER  XLI. %0a%0aThe  Manner  of  Dyeing  the  Amethystine  Colour,  Scarlet,  and %0acolour  Hysginum. %0a%0aIT  is  not  enough  to  have  robbed  the  precious  Stone  Ame- %0athyst of  its  Name,  but  when  they  had  it  perfect,  they  must %0a%0a1  3  lib.  18  shil.

Also, %0aafter  they  have  accomplished  the  (Colour)  Conchylium,  they %0athink  it  better  prepared  to  pass  into  the  Tyrian.  It  should %0aseem  that  these  double  Dyes  came  first  from  the  after- %0athought of  the  Workman,  when  he  employed  his  Skill  to %0achange  what  he  had  done  and  disliked.  And  from  this  is %0acome  a  Consideration,  and  a  Desire  is  derived  from  a  Fault %0aby  those  portentous  Contrivances ;  and  the  twofold  Way  of %0aLuxury  is  displayed,  by  laying  one  Colour  upon  another, %0awith  great  Labour,  so  as  to  render  it  what  is  called  more %0apleasant  and  delicate.  Nay,  they  also  mix  the  Dye  of  Land- %0acolours  ;  for  what  is  already  dyed  with  the  Coccus,  they  dye %0aagain  in  the  Tyrian  Purple,  to  make  the  Hysginum. %0a%0aThe  Coccus  is  a  red  Grain  that  cometh  from  Galatia,  as %0awe  shall  show  in  our  Account  of  (Plants)  of  the  Land  ;  or %0aelse  about  Emerita,  in  Lusitania  (Portugal),  and  that,  of  all %0aother,  is  most  esteemed.  But  to  sum  up  in  one  Word  these %0anoble  Colours,  note  this,  that  when  this  Grain  is  one  Year %0aold,  it  maketh  but  a  weak  Tincture ;  but  after  four  Years, %0athe  Strength  of  it  is  gone.  So  that,  neither  young  nor  old,  is %0ait  of  any  great  Strength.

It  is  pro- %0aduced in  muddy  Places,  always  standing  nearly  upright;  but %0anever  without  a  Companion,  which  they  call  Pinnoteres,  or, %0aaccording  to  some,  Pinnophylax.3  This  is  a  little  Shrimp,  or %0a%0a'  Alluding  to  the  word  "  Amethyst,"  which  resisteth  drunkenness. — %0aHolland. %0a%0a3  Pinna  ingens  and  P.  rotundata,  LINN.  — Wern.

The  Pinna  gapes  abroad,  and  showeth  to  the  rittle %0aFishes  her  Body  within,  which  has  no  power  of  seeing.  They %0amake  a  close  Attack  on  it;  and  as  their  Boldness  increases %0awith  their  Impunity,  they  enter  and  fill  the  Shell.  The  Sen- %0atinel discerns  this  Opportunity,  and  giveth  Token  of  it  by  a %0agentle  Pinch.  She  shuts  her  Mouth,  and  crusheth  whatever %0ais  within ;  and  then  she  delivers  its  proper  Share  to  her %0aCompanion.1  This  Fact  causes  me  to  be  so  much  the  more %0asurprised,  that  there  are  some  who  are  of  Opinion  that %0aCreatures  of  the  Water  have  no  Understanding.  The  Tor- %0apedo knoweth  her  own  Power,  while  she  herself  is  not  be- %0anumbed. She  lieth  covered  over  and  hidden  in  the  Mud, %0aready  to  catch  those  Fishes  which,  as  they  unsuspiciously %0aswim  over  her,  she  strikes  with  Numbness.  There  is  no %0aMeat  that  in  Tenderness  is  to  be  preferred  to  the  Liver  of %0athis  Fish.  Nor  is  the  Craftiness  of  the  Rana  less  than  this  ; %0awhich  is  the  same  that  is  called  the  Fisher  in  the  Sea.  She %0alifts  up  the  Horns  which  stand  erect  a  little  before  the  Eyes, %0aso  as  to  project  above  the  Mud  which  she  hath  stirred  up  ; %0aand  so  attracts  the  little  Fishes  which  gather  about  her, %0auntil  they  come  so  near  as  to  enable  her  to  seize  them.  In  a %0asimilar  Manner  the  Squatina  and  Rhombus  lie  concealed, %0aand  stretch  out  their  Fins,  which  they  move  about,  as  if  they %0awere  some  little  Worms;  and  the  Fish  called  Raia  does  the %0asame.  For  the  Pastinaca  lieth  in  wait  like  a  Thief  in  a %0aCorner,  ready  to  pierce  the  Fishes  that  pass  by  with  a  sharp %0aSpine,  which  is  his  Dart.  It  is  a  Proof  of  the  Craftiness  of %0athis  Fish,  that  whilst  they  are  the  most  sluggish  of  Fishes, %0athey  are  found  to  have  in  their  Belly  the  Mugil,  which  is %0athe  swiftest  of  all  Fishes. %0a%0a1  "  The  pinna  and  the  crab  together  dwell, %0aFor  mutual  succour,  in  one  common  shell. %0aThey  both  to  gain  a  livelihood  combine  ; %0aThat  takes  the  prey,  when  this  has  given  the  sign. %0aFrom  hence  this  crab,  above  his  comrade  fam'd, %0aBy  ancient  Greeks  was  pinnatores  nam'd." %0a%0aOPPIAN  :  Halicut,  lib.ii.  1. 186,  et  seq.— Wern.

Wlien  this  Creature  hath  swallowed  an %0aHook,  it  vomits  up  its  Entrails,  until  it  hath  delivered  itself %0aof  the  Hook,  and  then  it  suppeth  them  in  again.  But  the %0aVulpes  marinse,2  in  the  like  Danger,  swallow  down  more %0aand  more  of  the  Line,  until  it  conies  to  the  weakest  Part, %0awhich  it  can  easily  gnaw  asunder.  The  Fish  called  Glanis %0ais  more  cautious ;  it  bites  the  Back  of  the  Hook,  and  does %0anot  devour  the  Bait,  but  nibbles  it  away. %0a%0aCHAPTER  XLIV. %0aOf  the  Fish  called  Aries. %0a%0aTHE  Ram3  attacks  like  a  Robber ;  for  sometimes  it  hides %0aitself  under  the  Shade  of  large  Ships  in  the  salt  Sea, %0awhere  it  waiteth  for  any  Man  whom  the  Pleasure  of  Swim- %0aming may  invite  within  its  Reach ;  at  other  Times  it %0alifteth  its  Head  above  Water,  to  spy  any  small  Fishing- %0aboats,  arid  then  it  slily  swimmeth  close  to  them,  and %0asinketh  them. %0a%0aCHAPTER  XLV. %0a%0aOf  those  that  have  a  third  Nature,  and  are  neither  Animals %0anor  Plants :  also  of  Urticce  and  Sponges. %0a%0aI  TRULY  am  of  Opinion,  that  those  which  are  neither %0aAnimals  nor  Plants,  but  possess  a  third  Nature,  or  are  com- %0a%0a1  The  creatures  referred  to  appear  to  be  Holothuriae,  and  chiefly  of %0athe  class  Cucumariae ;  which,  when  near  death,  eject  their  entrails,  but %0awithout  the  power  of  re -absorbing  them.

Urticae  wander  about  by  Night,  and %0alikewise  by  Night  change  their  (Colour).  Their  Nature  is %0aformed  of  fleshy  Leafage,  and  on  Flesh  they  feed.  Their %0aQuality  is  to  raise  an  itching  Smart,  like  the  Land  Nettle. %0aIts  Manner  is  to  gather  in  its  Body  exceedingly  close  and %0astiff;  and  when  a  little  Fish  swimmeth  before  it,  it %0aspreadeth  abroad  its  Branches,  and  thus  claspeth  and  de- %0avoureth  it.  At  other  Times,  as  if  it  were  withered,  suffering %0aitself  to  be  tossed  to  and  fro  among  the  Weeds,  with  the %0aWaves  of  the  Sea,  if  any  Fishes  come  in  contact  with  it, %0ait  seizes  them,  as  they  scratch  the  Itching  they  feel  by  rub- %0abing themselves  against  the  Rocks.  By  Night  it  seeks  for %0aPectens  and  Echini.  When  it  feeleth  one's  Hand  to  touch %0ait,  it  changeth  Colour,  and  contracteth  itself.  When  touched, %0ait  discharges  something  that  causes  an  Itching ;  and  if  a %0alittle  Interval  is  permitted  after  it  is  touched,  it  becomes %0aconcealed.  It  is  thought  that  its  Mouth  lieth  in  the  Root, %0aand  that  it  voideth  its  Excrements  through  a  small  Pipe %0aabove. %0a%0aOf  Sponges  we  find  three  Sorts:  the  first  thick,  exceeding %0ahard,  and  rough ;  and  this  is  called  Tragos :  a  second,  not  so %0athick,  arid  somewhat  softer;  and  that  is  named  Manon  :  the %0athird  is  fine  and  compact,  wherewith  they  make  Rubbers  (to %0acleanse  with),  and  this  is  termed  Achilleum.  They  grow  all %0aupon  Rocks,  and  are  fed  with  Shell-fish,  Fish,  and  Mud. %0aThat  they  possess  Understanding  appeareth  from  this,  that %0awhen  they  feel  that  one  would  pluck  them  away,  they  draw %0ain,  so  as  with  the  greater  Difficulty  to  be  pulled  from  the %0aRock.  They  do  the  like  when  they  are  beaten  with  the %0a%0a1  Actineae,  a  class  of  naked  Zoophytes.     Macrobius,  in  his  account  of %0athe  supper  given  by  Lentulus,  on  the  occasion  of  his  being  inaugurated %0aFlamen  martialis,  enumerates  Urtica?  among  the  dishes.  —  Wern.

Others  contend  that  they  are  vegetable  ;  and %0atheir  natural  station  seems  to  be  on  that  debateable  line  where  each  of %0athese  great  kingdoms  verges  on  the  other  :  some  really  animal  structures %0aappearing  disguised  in  vegetable  forms,  —  and  vegetables  with   animal %0aappearances.  —  Wern.

And  some %0asay,  that  about  Torone  they  take  Food  after  they  have  been %0aplucked  from  the  Rocks ;  and  that  from  the  Roots  which %0aare  left  behind,  they  grow  again.  Also,  upon  those  Rocks %0a(from  whence  they  are  pulled),  there  is  to  be  seen  some %0aAppearance  of  Blood  sticking ;  and  especially  in  those  of %0aAfrica,  which  breed  among  the  Syrtes.  The  Manse  become %0avery  large,  and  also  the  softest,  about  Lycia.  But  they  are %0amore  soft  when  they  grow  in  the  very  deep  Water,  out  of  the %0aInfluence  of  Wind.  They  are  rough  in  the  Hellespont;  and %0adense  about  (the  Cape)  Malea.  In  Places  exposed  to  the %0aSun  they  will  putrify ;  and  therefore  the  best  are  in  deep %0aGullies.  They  are  of  the  same  blackish  Colour  when  they %0alive,  as  when  full  of  Moisture.  They  adhere  to  Rocks  nei- %0ather by  any  one  Part,  nor  yet  all  over ;  for  there  are  dispersed %0acertain  hollow  Pipes,  four  or  five  commonly,  by  which  they %0aare  supposed  to  receive  their  Food.  There  are  more  (of  these %0aPipes),  but  above  they  are  grown  together.  A  certain  thin %0aSkin  may  be  perceived  to  be  at  their  Roots.  It  is  known %0athat  they  live  long.  The  worst  Kind  of  them  all  are  those %0acalled  Aplysiae,  because  they  cannot  be  made  clean ;  in  them %0athe  Pipes  are  large ;  and  they  are  throughout  thick  and %0amassy. %0a%0aCHAPTER  XLVI. %0aOf  the  Caniculus  marinus.1 %0a%0aTHE  Divers  are  annoyed  very  much  with  a  great  Number %0aof  Caniculi  marini  that  come  about  them,  and  put  them  in %0agreat  Danger.  And  they  say,  that  these  Fishes  have  a  cer- %0atain Cloud  growing  thick  over  their  Heads,  like  that  of  the %0aflat  Fishes,  which  presseth  them,  and  hindereth  them  from %0aretiring  backward  ;  on  which  Account  the  Divers  have  with %0athem  sharp-pointed  Weapons  fastened  to  long  Poles ;  for %0aunless  they  be  pricked  with  them,  they  will  not  turn  away  : %0a%0a1  The  smaller  kind  of  Sharks,  and,  perhaps,  particularly  the  Ground- %0asharks,  Scymnium.  —  Wern.

For  I  never  heard  of  any  Man  that  found  the %0alike  Cloud  or  Mist  (for  this  Term  they  give  to  this  Mischief) %0ain  the  Range  of  living  Creatures.  But  the  Contest  with %0aCaniculi  is  furious,  for  they  snap  at  their  Groins,  their  Heels, %0aand  every  Part  of  their  Bodies  that  is  white.  The  only  safe %0aWay  is  to  oppose  them  in  front,  and  so  to  terrify  them  ;  for %0athey  are  as  much  afraid  of  a  Man  as  he  is  of  them.  Thus %0awithin  the  Deep  the  Chance  is  equal  ;  but  when  the  Divers %0amount  to  the  Surface  of  the  Water,  there  the  Danger  is %0adouble,  because  while  he  laboureth  to  get  out  of  the %0aWater,  he  faileth  of  Means  to  encounter  the  Creature  pro- %0aceeding in  an  opposite  Direction ;  therefore  his  only  recourse %0ais  to  his  Comrades :  for,  having  a  Cord  bound  about  his %0aShoulders,  by  which  they  draw  him  up,  he  shaketh  it  with %0ahis  left  Hand  to  give  a  Sign  of  his  Danger,  whilst  he  main- %0ataineth  a  Fight  with  the  right,  by  holding  with  it  the  sharp- %0apointed  Spear;  but  otherwise  they  haul  him  up  softly.  When %0ahe  is  come  near  the  Ship,  unless  they  snatch  him  up  very %0aquickly,  they  may  be  sure  to  see  him  devoured  before  their %0aFace  :  and  when  they  are  at  the  point  of  being  plucked  up, %0athey  are  caught  away  out  of  their  Hands,  if  they  do  not %0athemselves  help  them  who  are  drawing  them  up,  by  gather- %0aing up  their  Bodies  together,  into  the  form  of  a  Ball.  Some, %0aindeed,  thrust  at  these  Fishes  with  Tridents ;  but  it  is  the %0aCraft  of  this  Monster  to  get  under  the  Bottom  of  the  Ship, %0aand  so  maintain  the  Combat  in  safety.  And  therefore  all %0atheir  Care  is  employed  to  guard  against  this  Evil. %0a%0aCHAPTER  XL VI I. %0a%0aOf  those  Fishes  that  are  shut  within  a  flinty  Shell;  also  of %0athose  that  have  no  Sense :  and  of  other  sordid  Creatures. %0a%0aTHE  greatest  Security  that  Fishermen  have,  is  to  discover %0athe  flat  Fishes ;  for  they  are  never  in  any  Place  where  hurt- %0aful Beasts  are ;  which  is  the  Cause  that  Divers  call  those %0aFishes  sacred. %0a%0aWe  must  confess,  that  Fishes  enclosed  in  flinty  Shells,  as %0a%0a%0aBOOK  IX.]  History  of  Nature.  169 %0a%0aOysters,  have  no  Sense.  Many  are  of  the  same  Nature  as %0aPlants,  as  the  Holothuria,1  Pulmones,2  and  Stellae  (Star- %0afishes) ;  and  thus  there  is  nothing  that  is  not  bred  within  the %0aSea  ;  as  the  Creatures  which  in  Summer  Time  abound  within %0aour  Inns,  and  vex  us  with  their  active  Leap ;  as  also  that %0awhich  lies  close  under  the  Hair  of  our  Heads  :  for  often  the %0aFishermen  find  a  Number  of  these  Skippers3  settled  thick %0aabout  their  Baits  as  they  draw  them  up.

Dolphins  and  other  Whales  have  no %0aother  Way,  but  they  are  somewhat  slower.  The  Female %0aFish,  in  the  Time  of  coupling,  followeth  the  Male,  striking %0ahis  Belly  with  her  Snout.

Flat  Fishes,1  which  have  no  Tails  and  sharp %0aPrickles,  when  they  couple,  come  over  one  another,  like %0aTortoises.

The  other  soft  Animals  couple,  Back  to  Back,  as %0aDogs.  This  is  the  Case  with  Locustae,  Squillee,  Cancri,  at  the %0aMouth.  Frogs  lie  on  one  another :  the  Male  with  the  Fore- %0afeet clasping  the  Arms  of  the  Female,  and  with  the  Hind- %0afeet  the  Haunches.

The  Sepia  layeth  also  on  the %0aLand  among  the  Reeds,  or  else  where  she  can  find  Seaweeds %0agrowing,  and  by  the  fifteenth  Day  it  is  hatched.  The  Loligo %0alayeth  Eggs  in  the  deep  Water,  which  hang  close  together %0aas  those  of  the  Sepiae.  The  Purpurse,  the  Murex,  and  such %0alike,  lay  in  the  Spring.  The  Echini  are  with  Egg  at  the  Full- %0aMoons  in  the  Winter  :  and  the  Cochleae  are  bred  in  the %0aWinter  also.  The  Torpedo  is  found  to  have  fourscore  Young %0aat  once,  and  she  hatcheth  her  soft  Eggs  within  her  Body, %0ashifting  them  from  one  Place  of  the  Womb  to  another,  and %0athen  excludes  them.  In  a  similar  Manner  do  all  they  which %0aare  called  Cartilaginous.  By  which  it  cometh  to  pass,  that %0aFish  alone  both  conceive  Eggs,  and  bring  forth  a  living- %0aCreature.

Pausi- %0alippum  is  a  Country-seat  in  Campania,  not  far  from  Naples ; %0awhere  (as  Anneus  Seneca  writeth)  there  died  a  Fish  in  the %0aFish-ponds  of  C&sar,  threescore  Years3  after  it  had  been  put %0a%0a1  Aristotle  gives  the  name  of  Mus,  or  the  Mouse,  to  a  freshwater %0aturtle ;  some  of  which,  of  small  size,  are  as  active  in  the  water  as  a  mouse %0aon  land.

And  since  we %0amention  Fish-ponds,  we  should  do  well  to  write  a  little  more %0aof  them  before  we  give  over  this  Discourse  of  Creatures  of %0athe  Water. %0a%0aCHAPTER  LIV. %0aOf  Oyster-beds,  and  who  first  invented  them. %0a%0aTHE  first  who  invented  Oyster-beds  was  Sergius  Grata, %0awho  made  them  at  Bajanum,  in  the  Time  of  L.  Crassus  the %0aOrator,  before  the  Marsian  War.  And  this  he  did,  not  for %0ahis  Appetite,  but  for  Profit ;  and  by  this  Invention,  and %0aothers,  he  gathered  great  Revenues :  for  he  it  was  that  in- %0avented the  Hanging-baths,  and  so  sold  his  Villa  to  better %0aAdvantage.  He  was  the  first  Man  who  pronounced  the %0aLucrine  Oysters  to  be  of  the  most  excellent  Taste :  for  the %0asame  Kinds  of  Creatures  of  the  Water  in  one  Place  are  better %0athan  in  another :  as  the  Lupus-fish  in  the  River  Tiber,  be- %0atween the  two  Bridges  :  the  Rhomnus  (Turbot)  at  Ravenna  : %0athe  Mursena  in  Sicily :  the  Elops  at  Rhodes,  and  in  like %0aManner  of  other  Sorts  of  Fishes ;  for  I  do  not  intend  to  give %0aa  long  Criticism  on  Cookery.  At  this  Time  the  British %0aShores  were  not  employed  to  prepare  them  when  Grata %0aennobled  those  of  the  Lucrine  Lake ;  but  afterwards  it  was %0athought  profitable  to  seek  Oysters  from  Brundusium,  in  the %0afurthest  Part  of  Italy.  And  to  prevent  Controversy  between %0aopposite  Tastes,  it  was  of  late  devised  that  the  Oysters, %0awhich  in  the  long  Carriage  from  Brundusium  were  almost %0afamished,  should  be  fed  in  the  Lucrine  Lake.  A  little  before %0athis  same  Time,  Licinius  Murena  invented  Ponds  for  keeping %0aother  Fishes ;  and  his  Example  was  followed  by  Noblemen, %0aas  Philippus  and  Hortensius.  Lucullus  cut  through  a  Moun- %0atain near  Naples  (for  this  Purpose),  and  let  in  an  Arm  of  the %0aSea  into  his  Fish-ponds ;  the  Cost  of  which  was  greater  than %0athat  of  the  House  which  he  had  built.  For  this  Reason %0aPompey  the  Great  gave  him  the  Name  of  Xerxes  Togatus. %0aThe  Fishes  of  that  Pond,  after  his  death,  were  sold  for  thirty %0ahundred  thousand  Sesterces  (three  millions  of  Sesterces). %0a%0a%0a176  History  of  Nature.

He  it  was %0athat  lent  Ccesar  the  Dictator,  for  his  triumphal  Suppers,  six %0ahundred  Muraenae  in  Numher,  to  be  paid  again  ;  for  he %0awould  not  sell  them  for  Money,  nor  exchange  them  for  other %0aMerchandise.  Although  his  Villa  was  of  moderate  size,  yet %0athe  Fish-ponds  about  it  sold  the  House  for  four  millions  of %0aSesterces.

The  Orator  Hortensius  had  a  Pond  at %0aBauli,  upon  the  Side  that  lieth  toward  Baeiae,  in  which  was  a %0aMuraena  for  which  he  felt  such  regard,  that  when  it  was %0adead  it  is  believed  that  he  wept  for  it.1  At  the  same  Villa, %0aAntonia  the  wife  of  Drusus  affixed  Ear-rings  to  a  Muraena %0ain  which  she  delighted ;  the  Report  of  which  caused  some %0aPeople  to  wish  to  visit  Bauli. %0a%0aCHAPTER  LVI. %0aThe  Preserves  for  Snails ,2  and  who  first  invented  them. %0a%0aFULVIUS  HIRPINUS  was  the  first  Inventor  of  Store- %0apreserves  for  Snails  within  the  Territory  of  Tarquinii,  a  little %0abefore  the  Civil  War  with  Pompey  the  Great.  And  those %0ahad  their  distinct  Partitions  for  their  several  Sorts  :  so  that %0a%0a1  JElian  (B.  viii.  ch.  iv.),  perhaps  from  hearsay,  has  jumbled  these  two %0aincidents  into  one ;  but  he  has  added  a  piece  of  wit,  which  renders  it %0aworth  transcribing.     "  The  Romans  celebrate  the  Muraena  of  Crassus, %0awhich  he  adorned  with  ear-rings  and  precious  stones,  as  if  it  had  been  a %0abeautiful  girl.     He  also  taught  the  fish  to  know  his  voice,  and  to  swim  to %0ahim  and  take  food  from  his  hand.     I  have  been  informed  that  when  this %0afish  died  he  wept  for  it,  and  gave  it  an  honourable  funeral.     When  on %0asome  occasion  Domitius  said  to  him  :  *  What  a  fool,  Crassus,  to  weep  for %0athe  death  of  a  Mura?na  1 '    To  which  he  answered :  *  True,  I  wept  the %0adeath  of  an  animal ;  but  that  is  more  than  any  one  saw  you  do  at  the %0afunerals  of  your  three  wives.'" — Wern.

Varro. %0a%0aCHAPTER  LVII. %0aOf  Land-fishes. %0a%0aTHEOPHRASTUS  also  telleth  strange  Wonders  of  some %0akinds  of  Fishes  :  that  about  Babylon  there  are  Places  subject %0ato  the  Inundations  of  the  Rivers,  and  in  which  the  Water %0astandeth  in  Pits,  and  the  Fish  remain  after  the  Waters %0aare  returned  within  their  Banks  ;  and  that  some  of  these %0aFishes  quit  those  Retreats  to  seek  for  Food,  walking  with %0atheir  Fins,  and  wagging  their  Tails  as  they  go.  And  if  any %0apursue  them  they  retreat  into  their  Pits,  and  when  in  them, %0astand  opposed  to  them  :  that  their  Heads  are  like  those  of %0athe  Rana  marina,  but  the  other  Parts  like  the  Gobius  ;  and %0athe  Gills  as  in  other  Fishes.  Also  that  about  Heraclea  and %0aCromna,  and  the  River  Lycus,  and  in  many  Parts  of  Pontus, %0athere  is  one  Kind  that  haunteth  the  utmost  edges  of  the %0aRivers,  and  maketh  itself  Holes  in  the  Land,  and  liveth  in %0athem,  even  when  the  Shore  is  dry,  and  the  Rivers  are %0agathered  into  narrow  Channels.  Therefore  they  are  digged %0aout;  and  that  they  are  alive  appears  finally  by  the  Motion  of %0atheir  Bodies.  Near  the  abovesaid  Heraclea  and  the  River %0aLycus,  when  the  Water  is  ebbed,  there  are  Fishes  bred  from %0athe  Eggs  left  in  the  Mud ;  and  these,  in  seeking  their  Food, %0a%0a1  Three  wine  gallons  and  three  quarts :  for  a  Quadrans  is  three  Cyathi, %0ai.  e.  the  fourth  part  of  a  Sextarius,  and  a  Sextarius  is  a  wine  pint  and  a  half, %0aor  eighteen  ounces. %0a%0aBy  quoting  an  author,  Pliny  sufficiently  testifies  that  he  had  never %0aseen  a  shell  of  a  snail  (Calix)  of  such  size.  — Wern.

He  affirmeth, %0aalso,  that  the  Eggs  (of  Fishes)  lying  upon  the  dry  Land, %0awill  come  to  their  Maturity,  as  those  of  the  Tortoises.  Also, %0athat  in  the  same  Country  of  Pontus,  there  are  taken  Fishes %0ain  the  Ice,  and  Gobiones1  especially,  which  do  not  show  a %0avital  Motion,  but  by  the  Heat  of  the  Cooking- Vessels.  In %0athis  some  Reason  may  be  given,  although  the  Thing  is  won- %0aderful. The  same  Author  reporteth,  that  in  Paphlagonia %0athere  are  digged  out  of  the  Ground  Land-fishes  that  are  very %0aexcellent  as  Food  :  but  they  are  found  in  deep  Furrows,  in %0asuch  Places  where  no  Waters  settle.  Himself  wondereth %0ahow  they  are  produced  without  the  help  of  Moisture.  He %0asupposeth  that  there  is  in  them  a  certain  Force  of  Liquid  in %0aWells,  as  Fishes  are  found  in  some  of  them.  Whatever  it  is, %0asurely  it  is  less  wonderful,  considering  how  Moles  live  (a %0aCreature  naturally  keeping  under  Ground),  unless,  perhaps, %0athat  these  Fishes  are  of  the  same  Nature  with  Earth-worms. %0a%0aCHAPTER  LVIII. %0aOf  the  Mice  of  the  Nile. %0a%0aBUT  the  Inundation  of  the  Nile  brings  Credibility  to %0aall  these  Matters  ;  for  it  exceedeth  all  other  Wonders.  For %0awhen  the  Ground  becometh  again  uncovered,  little  Mice  are %0afound  imperfectly  formed  from  the  generative  Virtue  of %0aWater  and  Earth  :  having  one  Part  of  their  Body  living, %0abut  the  rest  of  the  Form  no  better  than  the  Earth. %0a%0aCHAPTER  LIX. %0aOf  the  Fish  Anthias*  and  how  it  is  taken. %0a%0aI  DO  riot  think  it  proper  to  omit  that  which  I  perceive %0amany  have  believed  concerning  the  Fish  Anthias.

Club. %0a%0a2  It  appears  from  Oppian,  B.  i.,  that  four  different  sorts  of  fish  were %0acalled  by  this  name.     The  fish  referred  to  by  Pliny  may  be  the  Labrus %0aanthias,  LINN.,  and  Serranus  anthias,  Cuv.  —  Wern.

For  the  Fisherman  goes  in  a  small  Boat  for  cer- %0atain Days  together,  to  a  certain  Distance  in  the  Sea,  with %0ahis  Garments  of  one  Colour,  at  one  Hour,  and  there  he %0acasteth  his  Bait.  But  whatever  is  thrown  from  the  Boat %0abecomes  an  Object  of  Suspicion  to  the  intended  Prey;  and %0awhat  it  feareth  it,  guards  against ;  until  at  length,  after  this %0ahas  been  often  practised,  one  Anthias,  enticed  by  the  Repe- %0atition, seizeth  the  Bait.  The  Fisherman  carefully  notes  this %0aone  Fish  as  the  Foundation  of  his  Hope,  and  the  Enticer  of %0aothers  that  will  be  caught.  And  that  is  no  hard  Matter  for %0ahim  to  do,  because  for  some  Days  that  Fish  alone  dares  to %0acome  to  the  Bait.  At  length  he  meets  with  some  others, %0aand  by  little  and  little  he  is  better  accompanied,  until  in  the %0aEnd  he  brings  with  him  large  Sculls,  so  that  now  the  oldest %0aof  them  being  so  well  accustomed  to  know  the  Fisherman, %0athey  will  snatch  Meat  out  of  his  Hand.  Then  he  thrusteth %0aforth  an  Hook  with  the  Bait,  somewhat  beyond  his  Fin- %0agers, and  flieth  upon  them  more  truly  than  catcheth  them, %0awith  a  short  Snatch ;  seizing  them  from  the  Shadow  of  the %0aShip,  in  such  a  Manner  as  not  to  scare  the  others  away. %0aIt  is  important  to  Success  that  he  should  know  the  first %0aEnticer,  that  he  may  not  take  him.  The  Fisherman  spareth %0ahim,  that  he  may  fly  to  some  other  Flock.  It  is  reported %0athat  one  contentious  Fisherman,  out  of  Ill-will,  captured  this %0aCaptain-fish  which  led  the  rest  into  the  Snare,  for  he  was %0awell  known  :  but  when  the  Fisherman  recognised  him  in  the %0aMarket  in  the  Possession  of  a  fellow-Fisherman,  regarding %0ahimself  as  wronged,  he  brought  his  Action  for  the  Damage,  so %0athat  the  other  was  condemned.  Mutianus  adds,  that  the  Fine %0awas  ten  Pounds.  The  same  Anthiae,  if  they  see  one  of  their %0aFellows  caught  with  a  Hook,  are  reported  to  cut  the  Line  with %0athe  serrated  sharp  Spines  which  they  have  upon  their  Back ; %0aand  that  one  which  hangeth  at  it,  stretcheth  it  out  straight, %0athat  it  may  be  cut  asunder  more  easily.  But  the  Sargus,  if %0ahe  find  himself  taken,  rubs  the  Line  against  a  Rock. %0a%0a%0a180  History  of  Nature.

They  say  it  is  so  fiery  hot,  that  whatever  it  toucheth %0ain  the  Sea  it  burneth  :  and  whatever  Food  it  receiveth,  it %0aimmediately  digesteth.  What  Proof  there  is  of  this  I  cannot %0areadily  say.

The  Nature %0aof  this  Fish  is  to  shine  in  the  Dark,  when  all  other  Light %0ais  taken  away.  The  more  Moisture  they  have,  the  more %0aLight  they  give  ;  they  shine  in  Men's  Mouths  as  they  chew %0athem:  they  shine  in  their  Hands:  on  the  Floor,  and  on  their %0aGarments,  if  any  Drops  fall  on  them  :  so  that  it  appeareth %0ato  proceed  from  the  very  Nature  of  that  Juice,  which  we  so %0awonder  at  in  the  Body. %0a%0aCHAPTER  LXII. %0aOf  the  Enmity  and  Amity  of  Fishes  between  themselves. %0a%0aTHERE  are  wonderful  Instances  of  Enmities  and  Agree- %0ament. The  Mugii  and  Lupus  burn  with  mutual  Hatred  ; %0alikewise  the  Conger  and  Mursena:  so  that  they  gnaw  off  one %0aanother's  Tails.  The  Locusta  is  so  afraid  of  the  Polypus, %0a%0a1  The  various  species  of  Star-fishes :  Asteriadce.  The  ancients  in- %0adulged the  idea  that  the  sea  contained  a  counterpart  of  every  thing  that %0awas  to  be  found  on  the  land  or  in  the  sky ;  but  to  support  this  opinion, %0athey  were  contented  with  very  loose  analogies,  or  mere  quibbles. — Wern. %0aClub. %0a%0a3  Pholades,  and  especially  Ph.  dactylus,  LINN.  —  Wern.

But  he  saith  that  those  Fishes  live,  although %0atheir  Tails  are  so  gnawed  off.  On  the  other  side,  there  are %0aExamples  of  Friendship  among  Fishes,  besides  those  of %0awhose  Society  I  have  already  written :  as  between  the %0aBalsena,  and  the  Musculus.2  For  whereas  the  (Balaena)  hath %0ano  use  of  his  Eyes,  by  reason  of  the  heavy  Weight  of  his %0aEyebrows  that  cover  them,  the  other  swimmeth  before  him, %0aand  serveth  him  instead  of  Eyes,  to  show  the  Shallows,  on %0awhich  his  vast  Bulk  might  be  grounded. %0a%0aFrom  this  we  will  proceed  to  speak   of  the  Nature  of %0aBirds. %0a%0a1  Locustae  congrum,  ex  Arist.  lib.  vii.  cap.  ii.

But  in  the  Sea,  which  is  so  widely %0a%3c spread  abroad,  so  soft  and  proper  to  yield  Nourishment %0a%3c and  increase,  and  receiveth  the  Causes  of  Propagation  from %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BOOK  IX.]  History  of  Nature.  107 %0a%3c %0a%3c on  high,  Nature  is  always  framing  some  new  Creatures, %0a%3c many  of  which  are  found  to  be  monstrous  Things.  For %0a%3c the  Seeds  and  universal  Elements  are  so  interlaced  and %0a%3c iningled  one  with  another,  partly  by  the  blowing  (of  the %0a%3c Winds),  and  at  other  Times  by  the  Agitation  (of  the  Waves), %0a%3c that  it  may  truly  be  said,  according  to  the  vulgar  Opinion, %0a%3c that  whatever  is  bred  in  any  Part  of  Nature  is  to  be  found %0a%3c also  in  the  Sea  ;  and  many  more  Things  besides,  which  no- %0a%3c where else  are  to  be  seen.  For  there  truly  not  only  exist  the %0a%3c Forms  of  Land  Animals,  but  also  of  many  other  Things;  and %0a%3c there  may  one  see  also  what  appear  like  Bunches  of  Grapes, %0a%3c Swords,  and  Saws;  yea,  and  also  Cucumbers,  which  for %0a%3c Colour,  Smell,  and  Taste,  resemble  those  that  grow  on %0a%3c the  Land.  And  therefore  we  need  the  less  to  wonder,  if  in %0a%3c such  little  Snails  there  are  some  Things  standing  out  like %0a%3c the  Heads  of  Horses. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  III. %0a%3c Of  Beasts  in  the  Indian  Sea. %0a%3c %0a%3c THE  Indian  Sea  breedeth  the  most  and  biggest  Animals ; %0a%3c among  which  Whales  (Balaenae)1  are  as  large  as  four  Acres  of %0a%3c Land  ;  and  Pristes  two  hundred  Cubits:  and  no  Wonder,  for %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  To  avoid  a  confusion  of  references,  the  species  of  whales  mentioned %0a%3c by  Pliny  are  here  arranged  at  one  view ;  and,  so  far  as  the  subject  admits, %0a%3c identified  with  those  recognised  by  modern  naturalists. %0a%3c %0a%3c The  term  "  Balaenae  "  appears,  in  its  widest  extension,  to  have  been  a %0a%3c general  name  for  the  whole  tribe ;  in  which  also  were  comprised  some %0a%3c inhabitants  of  the  ocean,  of  large  size,  which  had  nothing  in  common %0a%3c with  the  proper  whales  but  their  magnitude.  The  Pristis,  perhaps  the %0a%3c Basking  Shark  (Selachus  maximus,  Cuv.),  and  some  other  species,  and %0a%3c certainly  the  Tunny,  when,  as  sometimes  happens,  it  has  attained  enor- %0a%3c mous growth,  were  anciently  arranged  among  cetaceous  fishes.  But  be- %0a%3c sides this,  the  word  "  Balaena,"  or  "  Phalsena,"  was  the  proper  name  of %0a%3c the  animal  known  as  the  Balcenoptera  musculus,  or  the  Rorqual  of %0a%3c Cuvier;  which  they  did  not  distinguish  from  B.  Boops. %0a%3c %0a%3c The  creatures  referred  to  at  the  end  of  Ch.  3,  and  compared  to  horses, %0a%3c asses,  and  bulls,  were  probably  Dugongs,  or  Sea-cows ;  the  Manatus  and %0a%3c Halichore  of  Cuvier,  and  comprised  in  the  genus  Trichecus  of  Linncus. %0a%3c Physeter,  a  modern  as  well  as  ancient  genus  of  whales,  is  still  known  on %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 1 08  History  of  Nature.  [BoOK  1 X . %0a%3c %0a%3c Locusts  are  there  to  be  found  of  full  four  Cubits  :  and  Eels %0a%3c in  the  River  Ganges  of  thirty  Feet.  But  these  Beasts  in  the %0a%3c Sea  are  chiefly  to  be  seen  about  the  Solstice.  For  then  by %0a%3c the  Whirlwinds,  Rains,  and  Tempests,  which  rush  with  Vio- %0a%3c lence down  from  the  rugged  Mountains,  the  Seas  are  turned %0a%3c up  from  the  very  Bottom  ;  and  thus  the  Billows  roll  and %0a%3c raise  these  Beasts  out  of  the  deep  Parts  of  the  Ocean.  For %0a%3c in  that  Manner  so  great  a  Multitude  of  Tunnies  were  on  one %0a%3c occasion  driven  up,  that  the  Fleet  of  Alexander  the  Great  was %0a%3c able  to  make  head  against  them  in  no  other  Manner  than  by %0a%3c advancing  as  if  to  contend  with  an  Host  of  Enemies ;  for %0a%3c otherwise  if  they  had  sailed  singly  and  asunder,  there  had %0a%3c been  no  Way  to  escape.  By  no  Voice,  no  Noise,  no  Blows, %0a%3c but  by  the  Crash  only  were  they  terrified  ;  nor  are  they %0a%3c disturbed  but  by  Destruction. %0a%3c %0a%3c In  the  Red  Sea  there  is  a  great  Peninsula  named  Cadara, %0a%3c projecting  so  far  as  to  form  an  extensive  Bay,  which  it  took %0a%3c King  Ptolemceus  twelve  Days  and  Nights  to  row  through ; %0a%3c for  there  was  not  any  Wind  to  help  him.  Through  the %0a%3c Stillness  of  this  Place,  the  Beasts  grow  to  such  bigness, %0a%3c that  their  Weight  renders  them  not  able  to  stir.  The  Com- %0a%3c manders of  the  Fleets  of  Alexander  the  Great  reported, %0a%3c that  the  Gedrosi,  a  People  dwelling  on  the  River  Arbis, %0a%3c %0a%3c the  west  coasts  of  Britain,  by  the  corresponding  term  "  Blower."  The %0a%3c enormous  creature  cast  on  shore  at  Gades,  as  mentioned  at  the  end  of %0a%3c Chap.  5,  must  have  been  of  this  genus ;  and  as  the  number  of  teeth %0a%3c assigned  to  it  was  probably  counted  collectively,  after  the  jaws  were %0a%3c denuded  of  flesh,  when  some  also  are  seen  in  the  upper  jaw,  it  may  be %0a%3c supposed  probable  that  it  was  Ph.  macrocephalus. %0a%3c %0a%3c The  other  species  mentioned  by  Pliny  belong  to  the  genus  Delphinus  : — %0a%3c D.  Orca.     The  Grampus.  —  It  is  also  the  Aries  or  Ram  of  Pliny  ; %0a%3c from  a  white  crescent  over  the  eye,  marked  on  the  skin,  fancifully %0a%3c supposed  to  resemble  a  ram's  horn. %0a%3c D.

Phocana,  or  common %0a%3c %0a%3c Porpus. %0a%3c %0a%3c Whale  oil  is  mentioned,  B.  xxxii.  c.  1. %0a%3c The  Pristis  is  probably  the  P,  antiquorum,  or  Sawfish.  —  Wvrn.

There  are  others  also  which  have  Heads  like %0a%3c Horses,  Asses,  and  Bulls ;  and  these  eat  the  standing  Corn. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  IV. %0a%3c Which  are  the  greatest  Creatures  in  any  Ocean. %0a%3c %0a%3c THE  largest  Creature  in  the  Indian  Sea  is  the  Pristis  and %0a%3c Balsena  (Whale).  In  the  Ocean  of  Gaul  the  largest  is  the %0a%3c Physeter,  which  lifteth  itself  up  in  the  Manner  of  an  immense %0a%3c Pillar,  higher  than  the  Sails  of  Ships ;  and  spouteth  forth %0a%3c almost  a  Flood.  In  the  Ocean  of  Gades  there  is  a  Tree1 %0a%3c spreading  abroad  with  mighty  Arms,  to  such  an  extent  that  it %0a%3c is  believed  to  be  the  Cause  why  that  Arm  of  the  Sea  is  never %0a%3c entered.  There  are  to  be  seen  also  what  from  their  Shape %0a%3c are  called  Wheels,  distinguished  by  four  Rays  ;  with  their %0a%3c two  Eyes  closing  over  the  Naves  on  each  Side. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  V. %0a%3c %0a%3c Of  the  Forms  of  Tritons,  Nereids,  and  Sea- Elephants  * %0a%3c WHEN  Tiberius  was  Sovereign,  an  Embassy  of  the  Inha- %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  This  and  the  wheel  may  be  referred  to  some  large  species  of  coral, %0a%3c and  asterias,  or  sea-star ;  which  report  had  magnified  enormously.     But %0a%3c the  former  is  thought  by  Dr.  Hamilton  to  be  the  Kraken  of  Pontop- %0a%3c pidan  :  perhaps  a  species  of  Medusa,  or  Cuttle-fish,  of  which  a  wonderful %0a%3c figure  is  given  by  Denys  Montford,  where  one  of  these  creatures  is  seen %0a%3c capturing  a  Chinese  junk.  —  Wern.

The  stories  told  in  this  chapter %0a%3c were  probably  due  to  some  deception  practised  on  the  credulity  or  fear  of %0a%3c the  neighbourhood  by  some  skilful  swimmers.

And  it  is  not %0a%3c false  that  there  is  such  a  Creature  as  a  Nereid;  only  their %0a%3c Body  is  rough  with  Scales,  even  in  those  Parts  where  they %0a%3c possess  the  human  Form.  For  such  a  Female  Being  was %0a%3c beheld  on  the  same  Shore  ;  and  the  neighbouring  Inha- %0a%3c bitants heard  its  Moaning  from  a  Distance  when  it  was %0a%3c dying.  Also,  a  Governor  of  Gaul,  under  .Divus  Augustus, %0a%3c wrote,  that  many  of  these  Nereids  were  seen  dead  upon  the %0a%3c Shore.  I  possess  Authors,  illustrious  in  the  Equestrian %0a%3c Order,  who  testify  that  in  the  Ocean  near  Gades  they  saw  a %0a%3c Sea-man,  in  the  whole  Body  perfectly  resembling  a  Man  : %0a%3c that  in  the  Night  Season  he  would  come  aboard  their  Boats; %0a%3c and  on  whatever  Part  he  sat,  he  weighed  it  down  ;  so  that  if %0a%3c he  continued  there  any  long  Time  he  would  even  sink  it. %0a%3c When  Tiberius  was  Sovereign,  in  an  Island  opposite  the %0a%3c Coast  of  the  Province  of  Lugdunensis,  the  Sea,  when  it %0a%3c ebbed,  left  upon  the  Sands,  at  one  Time,  above  three  hun- %0a%3c dred Beasts,  of  a  wonderful  Variety  and  Bigness.  And %0a%3c there  were  no  fewer  found  upon  the  Coast  of  the  Santones. %0a%3c And  among  the  Rest  there  were  Elephants  and  Rams,  with %0a%3c Horns  like  those  (of  the  Land),  except  that  they  were %0a%3c white:  and  many  Nereids  also.  Turanius  hath  reported, %0a%3c that  a  Beast  was  cast  upon  the  Shore  at  Gades,  of  which  the %0a%3c Breadth  of  the  two  Fins  forming  the  Ends  of  the  Tail  was %0a%3c sixteen  Cubits  ;  it  had  120  Teeth,  of  which  the  biggest %0a%3c were  nine  Inches  in  Measure,  and  the  least  half  a  Foot. %0a%3c M.

But  the  evidence  has  failed  in  proportion  to  the  progress  of %0a%3c inquiry  ;  and  the  opinion  of  naturalists  of  the  present  age  appears  to  be, %0a%3c that  the  casual  and  hasty  appearance  of  the  young  of  the  Walrus,  before %0a%3c it  has  obtained  its  tusks,  has  been  the  cause  of  this  mistaken  idea.

The  Orcae  know  this ;  they  are  a  Beast  that %0a%3c are  a  deadly  Enemy  to  the  others ;  and  their  Likeness  can- %0a%3c not be  represented  by  any  other  Figure  than  that  of  a %0a%3c mighty  Lump  of  Flesh,  armed  with  terrible  Teeth.  These %0a%3c break  into  those  secret  Retreats,  and  bite  and  tear  the  young %0a%3c Calves,  or  those  newly  born,  with  the  old  ones  that  are %0a%3c great  with  Young;  they  also  pierce  into  them,  like  Ships  of %0a%3c War  attacking  with  their  Prows.

On %0a%3c the  other  Side,  the  Orcae  endeavour  to  lie  between  them  and %0a%3c the  Way  of  Escape,  and  kill  them  among  the  Straits  and %0a%3c ragged  Rocks,  to  drive  them  upon  the  Shallows,  or  force %0a%3c them  upon  the  Stones.

In  the  Harbour  of  Ostia,  also,  one  of  these  Orcae  was %0a%3c seen,  and  was  assailed  by  Claudius  the  Prince.  It  had  come %0a%3c when  he  was  making  the  Harbour,  enticed  by  the  Shipwreck %0a%3c of  Beasts'  Hides  that  were  brought  from  Gaul,  on  which  for %0a%3c several  Days  the  Creature  had  been  glutting  itself;  and  so %0a%3c it  had  made  a  Channel  in  the  Bottom  of  the  Shallows,  which %0a%3c was  so  narrowed  in  by  the  Action  of  the  Waves,  that  it  be- %0a%3c came too  narrow  for  the  Creature  to  turn  round  ;  but  while %0a%3c it  still  goeth  after  this  Gluttony,  being  thrown  by  the  Bil- %0a%3c lows upon  the  Shore,  its  back  appeared  high  above  the %0a%3c Water,  like  the  Bottom  of  a  Ship  turned  upside  down. %0a%3c Ccesar  commanded  Nets  and  Cords  with  many  Folds  to  be %0a%3c spread  along  the  Mouth  of  the  Harbour,  and  himself,  accom- %0a%3c panied with  the  Prsetorian  Cohorts,  exhibited  it  for  a  Show  to %0a%3c the  People  of  Rome;  the  Soldiers  being  brought  together, %0a%3c darted  their  Spears  from  the  Ships,  one  of  which  I  myself %0a%3c saw  sunk,  as  it  became  filled  with  the  Waves  that  this  Beast %0a%3c spouted  up.  Balsenae  have  Openings  in  their  Forehead  ;  and %0a%3c so  as  they  swim  on  the  Surface  of  the  Water,  they  blow  up %0a%3c aloft  Showers  of  Rain. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  VII. %0a%3c Whether  or  no  Fish  breathe  or  sleep. %0a%3c %0a%3c ALL  Writers  allow  that  a  very  few  other  Fishes  in  the %0a%3c Sea,  which  among  other  inward  Bowels  have  a  Lung, %0a%3c breathe ;  for  without  the  latter  Organ  no  Animal  is  thought %0a%3c to  draw  breath*  And  they  who  are  of  this  Opinion  suppose, %0a%3c likewise,  that  no  Fishes  having  Gills  draw  in  and  return %0a%3c their  Breath  by  turns  ;  nor  many  other  Kinds  besides,  al- %0a%3c though they  are  without  Gills  :  of  which  Opinion,  I  see,  was %0a%3c Aristotle;  and  he  supported  the  Doctrine  by  many  profound %0a%3c Researches.  But  I  must  not  conceal  that  1  do  not  entirely  agree %0a%3c with  this  Opinion ;  for,  if  Nature  be  so  disposed,  other  internal %0a%3c Organs  are  able  to  carry  on  the  Function  of  Breathing  in %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BOOK  IX.]  History  of  Nature.  1 13 %0a%3c %0a%3c the  Place  of  Lungs,  just  as  in  many  Creatures  another  Kind %0a%3c of  Humour  is  in  the  Place  of  Blood.  And  who  would  wonder %0a%3c that  this  vital  Breath  should  penetrate  within  the  Waters, %0a%3c considering  that  he  seeth  how  it  is  returned  from  them ;  and %0a%3c that  it  penetrateth  even  into  the  Earth,  which  is  the  grossest %0a%3c Part  of  Nature,  we  perceive  by  the  Example  of  the  Crea- %0a%3c tures, as  the  Moles,  which  live,  although  always  buried  in %0a%3c the  Ground.  I  have  effectual  Reasons  to  lead  me  to  believe, %0a%3c that  all  Things  in  the  Waters  breathe,  each  one  after  its %0a%3c Nature.  First,  I  have  often  observed  in  Fishes  an  evident %0a%3c Action  of  breathing  in  the  Heat  of  Summer;  and  also  that %0a%3c they  gape  when  the  Weather  is  calm ;  and  they  also  who %0a%3c believe  the  contrary,  confess  that  Fishes  sleep.1  For  what %0a%3c Place  is  there  for  Sleep  without  Breathing  ?  Moreover, %0a%3c whence  those  Bubbles  which  are  breathed  from  under %0a%3c Water?  and  the  increase  of  the  Bodies  of  Shell-fishes  by  the %0a%3c Influence  the  Moon  ?  But  above  all,  Fishes  possess  the %0a%3c power  of  Hearing  and  Smelling,2  and  no  doubt  both  these %0a%3c Senses  are  from  the  Matter  of  Air  :  for  it  can  be  understood %0a%3c that  Smell  is  nothing  but  the  Air  infected.  However,  let %0a%3c every  one  think  as  he  pleases  on  these  Points.  Neither %0a%3c Whales,  called  Balaense,  nor  Dolphins,  have  any  Gills.

Also  the  Sea-calves,  which  they %0a%3c call  Phoca:,  breathe  and  sleep  on  the  Land.

[BooK  IX. %0a%3c %0a%3c hath  afforded  an  Hinderance  ;  for  unless  they  turn  upright %0a%3c upon  their  Back,  they  cannot  lay  hold  ;  from  whence  chiefly %0a%3c appeareth  their  Swiftness.  For  when  the  Dolphins  are %0a%3c urged  by  Hunger  to  pursue  a  Fish  that  flies  before  them %0a%3c down  to  the  very  Bottom,  and  hold  their  Breath  for  a  long %0a%3c Time,  to  take  Breath  again  they  dart  aloft  as  if  they  were %0a%3c shot  out  of  a  Bow;  and  with  such  Force  do  they  spring  up, %0a%3c that  many  Times  they  pass  over  the  Sails  of  Ships.  They %0a%3c act  almost  as  if  they  were  united  in  Marriage.  They  pro- %0a%3c duce their  young  ones  in  the  tenth  Month,  in  the  Summer- %0a%3c time ;  and  sometimes  they  have  two  at  once.  They  suckle %0a%3c them  at  their  Teats,  as  the  (Whales)  Balaens  do ;  and  so %0a%3c long  as  their  little  ones  are  feeble  from  Youth,  they  carry  them %0a%3c about ;  so  that  even  when  they  are  become  of  full  size  they  bear %0a%3c them  Company  through  their  great  Affection  to  their  Young. %0a%3c Young  Dolphins  come  very  speedily  to  their  Growth;  for  in %0a%3c ten  Years  they  are  thought  to  have  come  to  their  full  Big- %0a%3c ness ;  but  they  live  thirty  Years,  as  hath  been  known  by  the %0a%3c Trial  of  cutting  a  Mark  in  their  Tail.  They  lie  close  for  the %0a%3c Space  of  thirty  Days,  about  the  Rising  of  the  Dog-star;  con- %0a%3c cealing themselves  in  some  unknown  Manner,  which  is  the %0a%3c more  wonderful  if  they  cannot  breathe  under  Water.  They %0a%3c are  accustomed  to  spring  forth  to  the  Land  from  some  un- %0a%3c certain Cause  ;  and  as  soon  as  they  touch  the  dry  Ground %0a%3c they  die :  and  so  much  the  sooner  because  their  Pipe  is %0a%3c closed.  Their  Tongue  is  movable,  contrary  to  the  Nature  of %0a%3c other  Creatures  living  in  the  Waters  ;  it  is  also  short  and %0a%3c broad,  not  much  unlike  that  of  a  Swine.  Their  Voice  resem- %0a%3c bleth  the  Moaning  of  a  Man  ;  they  are  Saddle-backed,  and %0a%3c the  Snout  is  flat.  And  this  is  the  Cause  that  all  of  them,  in %0a%3c a  wonderful  Manner,  acknowledge  the  Name  Simo,  and  like %0a%3c to  be  so  called.  The  Dolphin  is  not  only  a  friendly  Creature %0a%3c to  Man,  but  also  to  the  Art  of  Music:  it  is  delighted  with %0a%3c Harmony  in  Song,  but  especially  with  the  Sound  of  the %0a%3c Water  Instrument.  Of  Man  it  is  not  afraid  as  of  a  Stranger; %0a%3c but  meeteth  their  Ships,  playeth  as  if  in  Joy,  enters  into %0a%3c Competition,  and  out-goeth  them,  although  they  carry  full %0a%3c Sails. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BOOK  IX.]  History  of  Nature.  \  15 %0a%3c %0a%3c When  Divus  Augustus  was  Sovereign,  a  Dolphin  in  the %0a%3c Lake  Lucrinus  loved  with  wonderful  Affection  a  Boy  who %0a%3c was  the  Son  of  a  poor  Man  ;  and  who,  using  to  go  every  Day %0a%3c to  a  Grammar-School  from  Baianum  to  Puteoli,  was  accus- %0a%3c tomed about  Noon  to  loiter  and  call  the  Dolphin  by  the %0a%3c Name  of  Simo ;  and  many  Times  he  would  give  him  Frag- %0a%3c ments of  Bread,  which  for  that  Purpose  he  brought  with  him. %0a%3c I  should  be  reluctant  to  relate  this,  but  that  Meccenas,  Fabi- %0a%3c anus,  Flavins  Alfius,  and  many  others,  have  committed  the %0a%3c Matter  to  Record.  At  whatever  Time  of  the  Day  this  Boy %0a%3c called  him,  however  hidden  and  concealed,  he  would  hasten %0a%3c from  his  Retreat ;  and  being  fed  from  his  Hand,  he  gently %0a%3c offered  him  his  Back  to  mount  upon,  lowering  down  the %0a%3c Spines  of  his  Fins,  as  into  a  Sheath.  And  when  on  his  Back %0a%3c he  carried  him  over  the  broad  Sea  as  far  as  Puteoli  to %0a%3c School ;  in  the  same  Manner  conveying  him  back  again  for %0a%3c many  Years.  But  when  the  Boy  fell  sick  and  died,  the %0a%3c Dolphin  frequented  at  Intervals  the  accustomed  Place,  as %0a%3c one  that  was  sadly  distressed ;  at  last  (in  a  Manner  that  no %0a%3c one  could  doubt)  he  also  died  from  Regret.1 %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  The  works  of  ancient  naturalists  abound  in  stories  concerning  the %0a%3c Dolphin  and  its  friendliness  to  the  human  race ;  and  from  circumstances %0a%3c which  the  Editor  has  been  made  acquainted  with,  it  would  appear  that  on %0a%3c some  occasions  slight  signs  of  recognition  have  been  occasionally  mani- %0a%3c fested between  at  least  some  species  of  cetaceous  animals  and  voyagers. %0a%3c There  is  reason  to  believe,  however,  that  these  approaches  to  intimacy %0a%3c have  been  directed  rather  to  the  ship  than  the  sailors,  and  that  the  crea- %0a%3c ture has  mistaken  the  vessel  for  one  of  its  own  kind.  It  must  be  allowed %0a%3c that  nothing  similar  to  the  circumstances  ascribed  to  this  creature  by %0a%3c Pliny,  JElian,  and  the  Greek  writers  quoted  by  Aulus  Gellius,  has  been %0a%3c seen  in  modern  times;  but  the  multitude  of  witnesses,  and  the  alleged %0a%3c publicity  of  some  of  these  occurrences,  may  be  regarded  as  warrants  that %0a%3c something  at  least  unusual  had  occurred  at  the  time  referred  to.  It  may %0a%3c serve  in  eliciting  the  truth,  if  we  compare  the  narratives  of  these  ancient %0a%3c authors  with  one  another,  and  with  the  well-known  habits  and  appear- %0a%3c ance of  the  Dolphin  (Delphinus  Delphis).  .ZElian's  account  of  a  circum- %0a%3c stance exceedingly  similar  to  this  of  Pliny,  is,  with  a  slight  abridgment, %0a%3c thus  (B.  vi.  c.  15)  :  —  "The  celebrated  instance  of  affection  which  a  Dol- %0a%3c phin at  Jasos  (in  Caria)  expressed  for  a  beautiful  boy  must  not  be  passed %0a%3c over  in  silence.  The  gymnasium  of  the  people  of  Jasos  overlooks  the %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 1 16  History  of  Nature.  [BooK  IX. %0a%3c %0a%3c Another  Dolphin,  not  many  Years  since,  upon  the  Coast %0a%3c of  Africa,  near  to  Hippo  Diarrhytus,  in  like  Manner  would %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c sea ;  and  after  the  races  were  over,  it  was  the  custom  of  the  young  men %0a%3c to  go  to  the  shore  and  bathe.  On  one  occasion  when  they  were  indulging %0a%3c themselves  in  swimming,  a  dolphin  was  attracted  with  the  most  vehement %0a%3c love  to  one  of  these  youths,  who  was  remarkably  beautiful.  When  first %0a%3c the  creature  approached  him  he  was  not  a  little  afraid ;  but  as  the  fami- %0a%3c liarity increased  the  young  man  became  so  conciliated,  that  he  learned  to %0a%3c regard  him  with  kindness  and  friendship.  They  played  together,  and %0a%3c contended  in  swimming ;  and  the  boy  would  sit  on  his  back,  and  be  car- %0a%3c ried about  as  on  a  horse.  The  sight  soon  attracted  the  attention  of  the %0a%3c people  of  the  place,  and  also  of  strangers.  The  dolphin  continued  to %0a%3c manifest  his  love  for  this  young  man,  and  would  carry  him  out  to  sea,  as %0a%3c far  as  was  agreeable  to  his  friend  ;  and  then  he  would  return  and  deposit %0a%3c him  on  the  shore.  This  dolphin  was  accustomed  to  make  his  appearance %0a%3c at  the  time  when  the  young  man  was  dismissed  from  the  gymnasium; %0a%3c and  their  joy  on  meeting  appeared  to  be  mutual.  This,  however,  at  last, %0a%3c met  with  a  fatal  termination ;  for  the  boy,  being  tired  with  exercise,  on %0a%3c one  occasion  threw  himself,  naked  as  he  was,  on  the  back  of  the  dolphin, %0a%3c not  observing  the  sharp  spine  on  the  back  of  the  animal,  as  it  stood  erect; %0a%3c and  thus  he  pierced  himself  at  the  navel  with  its  point :  a  vein  being %0a%3c wounded,  by  which  he  bled  to  death.  The  dolphin  was  not  slow  in  dis- %0a%3c covering that  his  friend  was  seriously  injured  —  partly  by  the  difference %0a%3c of  weight,  for  he  did  not  sit  on  his  back  in  the  light  and  active  manner %0a%3c he  had  been  accustomed  to,  and  partly  by  seeing  the  water  stained %0a%3c with  blood ;  he  therefore  resolved  not  to  survive  him  whom  he  had  so %0a%3c affectionately  loved.  He  ran  himself,  with  all  his  might,  upon  the  shore, %0a%3c and  both  of  them  died  together.  A  monument  was  raised  by  the  people %0a%3c of  the  city  to  commemorate  this  love  between  the  young  man  and  the %0a%3c dolphin."  And  the  author  concludes  by  saying,  that  he  had  heard  of  other %0a%3c instances  of  similar  affection :  one  of  which  had  occurred  at  Puteoli,  in %0a%3c Italy ;  and  which,  doubtless,  was  the  same  as  is  mentioned  by  Pliny. %0a%3c %0a%3c Aulus  Gellius  adds  to  this  an  instance  which  he  had  derived  from %0a%3c Apion,  whom,  as  an  author  on  the  subject  of  wonders,  we  have  mentioned %0a%3c before  (Vol.  i.  p.  21),  and  who  authenticates  the  story  by  affirming  that %0a%3c he  saw  it  himself:  —  "I  saw,"  says  he,  "near  Dicsearchia  (Puteoli),  a %0a%3c dolphin  that  had  great  affection  for  a  boy,  and  manifested  this  feeling  at %0a%3c the  sound  of  his  voice.  The  fish  would  then  swim  near,  and  take  the  lad %0a%3c on  his  back  ;  he  would  fold  back  the  spines  of  his  fins  that  he  might  not %0a%3c hurt  him,  and  then  would  carry  him  to  the  distance  of  two  hundred %0a%3c stadia,  astride  on  his  back.  Rome,  therefore,  and  all  Italy,  were  poured %0a%3c out  to  see  this  affectionate  fish."  It  is  to  be  regretted  that  the  works  of %0a%3c Apion  have  perished  ;  but  the  little  that  remains  is  sufficient  to  show  that %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BOOK  1 X .]  History  of  Nature.  1 1 7 %0a%3c %0a%3c take  Meat  from  a  Man's  Hand,  suffer  himself  to  be  handled, %0a%3c play  with  them  that  swam  in  the  Sea,  and  carry  on  his  Back %0a%3c %0a%3c his  authority  must  not  carry  great  weight,  even  when  he  professes  to %0a%3c have  himself  witnessed  the  occurrence.  This  Egyptian  is  also  the  autho- %0a%3c rity for  the  story  of  Androclus  and  the  Lion ;  which  he  also  asserts  to %0a%3c have  occurred  under  his  own  notice.  Yet,  setting  aside  the  negative %0a%3c evidence  derived  from  the  silence  of  Pliny,  who,  if  he  had  believed  it, %0a%3c would  have  found  it  an  excellent  illustration  of  his  history  of  that  beast, %0a%3c there  is  one  portion  of  it  which  is  altogether  incredible  :  and  the  doubt %0a%3c arising  from  which  must  render  suspicious  whatever  of  a  surprising %0a%3c nature  the  same  author  anywhere  reports.  He  says,  that  with  the  gift %0a%3c of  freedom,  Androclus  also  was  presented  with  the  lion ;  which  he  led %0a%3c quietly  about  the  city,  with  a  slight  string,  collecting  money  at  the %0a%3c taverns.  To  enhance  the  wonder,  the  beast  is  represented  to  have  been %0a%3c of  unusual  size  and  ferocity ;  but  however  well  disposed  such  an  animal %0a%3c might  be  to  recognize  one  from  whom  it  had  received  an  obligation,  it  is %0a%3c contrary  to  its  nature  for  a  fierce  and  hitherto  untamed  lion  to  have %0a%3c changed  its  character  so  far  as  to  have  been  reconciled  suddenly  to  the %0a%3c noisy  crowd  of  a  city,  and  to  have  been  led,  only  by  a  slight  string, %0a%3c crowned  with  flowers,  without  fearing  or  doing  harm. %0a%3c %0a%3c The  narratives  of  the  dolphin  are  equally  contrary  to  nature,  and %0a%3c that  in  several  particulars,  in  which  an  intelligent  observer  could  not  be %0a%3c mistaken :  whether  that  observer  was  Apion,  whom  A.  Gellius  charac- %0a%3c terizes as  being  "  vitio  studioque  ostentationis  loquacior,"  and  "  sane  quam %0a%3c praedicandis  doctrinis  suis  venditator : "  or  Mecaenas  himself.  Of  these %0a%3c errors  one  concerns  the  form  of  the  animal,  which  is  described  as  having %0a%3c the  mouth  beneath  the  head,  and  a  dorsal  fin  armed  with  sharp-pointed %0a%3c spines,  capable  of  voluntary  motion :  the  latter,  especially,  not  only  un- %0a%3c like what  belongs  to  the  dolphin,  but  to  anything  that  could  have  been %0a%3c mistaken  for  it.  The  mode  of  progress  in  the  water  of  the  real  dolphin, %0a%3c is  also  known  to  be  such  as  does  not  admit  these  stories  to  be  applied  to %0a%3c it.  The  dolphin  rises  to  the  surface  for  the  purpose  of  breathing ;  and %0a%3c then  is  compelled  to  roll  itself  forward  in  a  manner  which  does  not %0a%3c admit  of  its  continuing  to  pass  along  the  surface,  even  to  the  extent  of %0a%3c a  few  yards.  But  what  thus  appears  inapplicable  to  the  structure  and %0a%3c habits  of  the  real  dolphin  is  not  exceedingly  foreign  to  another  inha- %0a%3c bitant of  the  ocean.  The  common  Seal  (Phoca  Vitulina)  has  on  some %0a%3c occasions  manifested  all  the  affectionate  attachment  to  man  which  the %0a%3c ancients  ascribed  to  the  dolphin.  A  little  instruction  will  secure  this ; %0a%3c and  however  it  might  have  been  concealed  for  interested  purposes,  there %0a%3c can  be  little  doubt  that  the  creatures  of  which  these  stories  were  related %0a%3c in  ancient  times,  had  been  previously  trained  to  the  actions  they %0a%3c [,  —  Wern.

But  being  anointed %0a%3c with  Unguent  by  Flavianus  the  Proconsul  of  Africa,  the %0a%3c Creature  (as  it  should  seem)  being  rendered  sleepy  by  this %0a%3c new  Smell,  and  floating  about  as  if  had  been  half  dead, %0a%3c avoided  Intercourse  with  Man  for  several  Months,  as  if  it %0a%3c had  been  driven  away  by  some  Injury.  But  after  a  Time  he %0a%3c returned  to  the  same  surprising  Practice.  But  the  Wrongs %0a%3c that  some  great  Persons  were  the  cause  of,  in  their  Enter- %0a%3c tainment, as  they  came  to  see  this  Sight,  caused  the  Men  of %0a%3c Hippo  to  kill  the  Dolphin. %0a%3c %0a%3c Long  before  this  the  like  is  reported  concerning  a  Boy  in %0a%3c the  City  of  Jassus,  where  a  Dolphin  was  observed  for  a  long %0a%3c Time  to  express  Love  to  a  Boy ;  but  while  he  eagerly  fol- %0a%3c lowed the  Lad  to  the  Shore  as  he  was  going  away,  he  threw %0a%3c himself  upon  the  Sand,  and  died.  Alexander  the  Great %0a%3c appointed  this  Boy  to  be  the  Priest  of  Neptune  at  Babylon  : %0a%3c interpreting  the  Love  of  this  Dolphin  as  a  Sign  of  the  special %0a%3c Favour  of  that  god  to  him. %0a%3c %0a%3c Egesidemus  writeth,  that  in  the  same  City  of  Jassus  there %0a%3c was  another  Boy  named  Hermias,  who  having  used  in  the  same %0a%3c Manner  to  ride  upon  a  Dolphin  over  the  Sea,  was  in  a  sud- %0a%3c den Storm  drowned  in  the  Waves,  and  was  brought  back  by %0a%3c the  Dolphin ;  who,  confessing  that  he  was  the  Cause  of  his %0a%3c Death,  did  not  return  into  the  Sea,  but  died  on  the  dry  Land. %0a%3c %0a%3c The  like  happened  at  Naupactum,  by  the  Report  of  Theo- %0a%3c phrastus.  But  there  is  no  End  of  such  Examples  ;  for  the %0a%3c Amphilochi  and  Tarentini  relate  the  same  concerning  Boys %0a%3c and  Dolphins  ;  which  Instances  induce  us  also  to  believe %0a%3c that  Arioti,  who  was  a  skilful  Player  on  the  Harp,  when  the %0a%3c Sailors  were  preparing  to  kill  him,  by  throwing  him  into  the %0a%3c Sea,  and  so  intercept  all  his  Gains,  by  conciliating  them, %0a%3c obtained  the  Favour  that  he  might  first  be  permitted  to  sing- %0a%3c to  his  Harp ;  and  a  number  of  Dolphins  having  flocked %0a%3c about  him  in  consequence  of  his  Music,  when  they  threw %0a%3c him  into  the  Sea,  he  was  received  by  one  of  them,  and %0a%3c carried  to  the  Shore  of  Tsenarus. %0a%3c %0a%3c In  the  Province  of  Narbonensis,  and  in  the  Territory  of %0a%3c Nsemausium,  there  is  a  Pond  called  Laterra,  where  Men  and %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BOOK  IX.]  History  of  Nature.  119 %0a%3c %0a%3c Dolphins  fish  in  company :  for  at  one  certain  Time  a  very %0a%3c great  Abundance  of  Mullets,1  taking  the  Advantage  of  a %0a%3c Change  of  the  Tide  at  the  narrow  Passages  of  the  Pond, %0a%3c break  forth  into  the  Sea ;  and  because  of  that  Violence  no %0a%3c Nets  can  be  spread  out  against  them  by  any  Means  strong %0a%3c enough  to  bear  their  huge  Weight  with  that  of  the  Stream  of %0a%3c Water,  if  Skill  were  not  employed  at  the  proper  Time.     In %0a%3c like  Manner  the  Mullets  immediately  urge  on  to  the  Deep, %0a%3c which  they  do  very  soon,  as  the  Channel  is  near ;  and  they %0a%3c make  all  Haste  to  pass  the  only  Place  that  is  convenient  for %0a%3c spreading  the  Nets.     The  Fishermen  being  aware  of  this, %0a%3c and  all  the  neighbouring  People  (for  a  Multitude  of  People %0a%3c come  thither,  knowing  when  the  fishing  Time  is  come ;  and %0a%3c the  rather  as  they  are  eager  to  see  the  pleasant  Sport),  shout %0a%3c as  loud  as  they  can  from  the  Shore,  and  so  call  Simo  to %0a%3c partake  of  the  Sight.     The  Dolphins  soon  hear  what  they %0a%3c would  have ;  and  the  better  if  the  North  Winds  blow  and %0a%3c carry  the  Sound :  for  a  South  Wind  more  slowly  bears  it  in %0a%3c the  opposite  Direction.     But  before  one  would  be  aware  of %0a%3c it,  the  Dolphins  fly  thither  to  assist  in  the  Fishing.     The %0a%3c Squadrons  of  those  Dolphins  quickly  take  their  Station,  and %0a%3c are  presently  arranged  in  the  Place  where  the  Battle  is  dis- %0a%3c posed, to  oppose  themselves,  and  keep  them  from  the  Deep; %0a%3c and  so  urge  them,  terrified  as  they  are,  into  the  Shallows. %0a%3c Then  the  Fishermen  enclose  them  with  Nets,  which  they  prop %0a%3c up  with  forked  Sticks  ;  yet  notwithstanding  this,  the  Mullets %0a%3c are  so  active  that  they  will  leap  over  them.     But  these  are %0a%3c caught  by  the    Dolphins,   who,  contenting  themselves  for %0a%3c the  present  to  kill  only,  put  off  the  Time  of  feeding  until %0a%3c they  have  achieved  the  Victory.     And  now  the  Work  of  the %0a%3c Battle  is  hot,  for  the  Dolphins  are  very  eager,  and  take  Plea- %0a%3c sure to  be  enclosed  within  the  Nets;  but  lest  this  should %0a%3c drive  the  Enemies  to  flight,  they  pass    so  gently  between %0a%3c the  Boats  and  Nets,  or  the  Men  there  swimming,  that  it %0a%3c cannot  be  seen  where  they  get  out.     And  although  at  other %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  See  chapter  xvii.  The  habits  here  ascribed  to  this  fish,  and  the %0a%3c necessity  of  staking  up  the  nets  when  it  is  enclosed  in  it,  are  well  known %0a%3c at  the  present  time.  —  See  YABRELL'S  British  Fishes.  —  Wern.

But  conscious  to  themselves  that  their  Labour  hath %0a%3c earned  a  richer  Reward  than  what  belongs  to  one  Day,  they %0a%3c conceal  themselves  until  the  next;  and  are  not  contented %0a%3c with  Fish  only,  but  wait  to  receive  Crumbs  of  Bread  soaked %0a%3c in  Wine.  Mutianus  maketh  mention  of  some  Things  of  a %0a%3c similar  Kind  of  Fishing  in  the  Bay  of  Jassus  ;  but  they  differ %0a%3c in  this,  that  the  Dolphins  come  of  their  own  accord,  without %0a%3c calling,  take  their  Part  of  the  Prize  from  the  Fishermen's %0a%3c Hands;  and  every  Boat  hath  a  Dolphin  attending  upon  it  as %0a%3c a  Companion,  although  it  is  by  Night,  and  with  Torchlight. %0a%3c Also  Dolphins  have  a  public  Society  among  themselves; %0a%3c for  a  King  of  Caria  having  taken  a  Dolphin,  and  kept  him  con- %0a%3c fined in  the  Harbour,  a  great  Multitude  of  the  others  resorted %0a%3c thither,  and  by  Signs  of  Mourning,  evident  to  be  understood, %0a%3c craved  Mercy  for  the  Prisoner :  until  the  King  had  given %0a%3c Command  to  set  him  at  Liberty.  Also  the  little  ones  are %0a%3c always  accompanied  with  some  larger  one,  as  a  Keeper. %0a%3c And  they  have  been  seen  to  carry  one  of  their  Companions %0a%3c when  he  is  dead,  that  he  might  not  be  torn  by  Beasts. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  IX. %0a%3c Of  Tursiones. %0a%3c %0a%3c The  Creatures  which  are  called  Tursiones,  are  much  like %0a%3c the  Dolphins;  but  they  differ  in  having  a  more  gloomy  As- %0a%3c pect :  for  they  are  not  so  playful  ;  but  especially  in  having %0a%3c Snouts  like  little  Dogs  when  they  snarl. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  X. %0a%3c Of  Sea- Tortoises,  and  how  they  are  taken. %0a%3c %0a%3c THERE  are  Tortoises  in  the  Indian  Sea  so  great  that  the %0a%3c Natives  cover  the  Cottages  in  which  they  dwell  with  the  Shell %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BOOK  IX.]  History  of  Nature.  1 2 1 %0a%3c %0a%3c of  a  single  one  of  them.  And  among  the  Islands,  principally %0a%3c in  the  Red  Sea,  they  use  them  for  Boats. %0a%3c %0a%3c Many  Ways  the  Fishermen  have  to  catch  them  ;  but %0a%3c especially  as  in  the  Mornings,  when  the  Weather  is  still, %0a%3c they  float  on  the  open  Sea  with  their  Backs  high  above  the %0a%3c calm  Surface;  and  then  the  Pleasure  of  breathing  freely  so %0a%3c entirely  deceives  them  into  Forgetful  ness,  that  their  Crust %0a%3c becomes  dried  with  the  Sun's  Heat,  and  they  cannot  dive, %0a%3c but  are  forced  againt  their  Wills  to  float,  and  so  are  exposed %0a%3c as  a  Prize  to  those  that  hunt  them.  Some  say  that  they  go %0a%3c out  in  the  oNight  to  feed;  arid  with  eating  greedily,  grow %0a%3c weary  ;  so  that  in  the  Morning,  when  they  are  returning %0a%3c again,  they  fall  asleep  on  the  Surface  of  the  Water  ;  and  then %0a%3c they  utter  such  a  Snoring  as  to  be  easily  taken.  But  three %0a%3c Men  must  swim  to  every  one  of  them  :  two  of  them  to  turn %0a%3c him  upon  his  Back,  and  the  third  to  throw  a  Cord  about %0a%3c him  as  he  lieth  with  his  Belly  upward ;  and  then  is  he %0a%3c hauled  by  many  to  the  Land.  In  the  Phoenician  Sea  they %0a%3c are  taken  with  very  little  Difficulty;  for  at  a  certain  Time %0a%3c of  the  Year  they  resort  of  themselves,  in  great  Multitudes,  to %0a%3c the  River  Eleutherus. %0a%3c %0a%3c The  Tortoise  hath  no  Teeth,  but  the  Borders  of  his  Snout %0a%3c are  sharp ;  the  upper  part  shutting  close  upon  the  under, %0a%3c like  a  Box.  In  the  Sea  they  live  on  Shellfish,  for  their %0a%3c Mouths  are  so  hard  that  they  crush  Stones.  They  go  to %0a%3c Land,  where,  among  the  Herbage,  they  lay  Eggs  resembling %0a%3c the  Eggs  of  Birds,  to  the  number  of  a  hundred.  They  hide %0a%3c them  in  the  Ground  at  some  Distance  from  the  Water,  cover %0a%3c them  with  Earth,  beat  it  hard  down  and  smooth  it  with  their %0a%3c Breast,  and  by  Night  sit  upon  them  :  the  Young  are  pro- %0a%3c duced in  the  Course  of  a  Year.  Some  suppose  that  the  look- %0a%3c ing upon  their  Eggs  with  their  Eyes  serveth  also  to  hatch %0a%3c them.  The  Female  flieth  from  the  Male  until  he  places  some %0a%3c Stick  upon  her  as  she  turns  away. %0a%3c %0a%3c The  Trogloditse  possess  some  that  carry  Horns,  like  the %0a%3c broad  Horns  fastened  to  the  Lyre,  but  movable,  with  which %0a%3c in  swimming  they  help  themselves  as  with  an  Oar.

Others  have  only  a  bare  Skin, %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  On  this  passage  Mr.  Bruce  remarks,  that  the  Romans  seem  to  have %0a%3c been  ignorant  of  the  art,  as  practised  by  the  Arabians  and  Egyptians,  of %0a%3c separating  the  laminae  by  fire  placed  inside  the  empty  shell.  Martial %0a%3c says,  "  Beds  were  inlaid  with  it ; "  and  the  immense  use  made  of  it  by  the %0a%3c Romans  is  shown  by  what  Velleius  Paterculus  says,  —  "  that  when  Alex- %0a%3c andria was  taken  by  Julius  Caesar,  the  warehouses  were  so  full  of  it,  that %0a%3c he  proposed  making  it  a  principal  ornament  of  his  triumph."  —  See %0a%3c B.  xxxii.  c.  4.  The  comparison  which  Pliny  makes  (c.  10)  of  the  size  of %0a%3c the  shell  of  a  tortoise  to  a  cymba  or  boat,  ^Elian  refers  to  a  scapha,  the %0a%3c origin  of  the  English  word  "skiff";  and  he  represents  it  as  capable  of %0a%3c holding  ten  medimni,  or  sixty  bushels :  in  another  place  (B.  xii.  c.  41)  he %0a%3c compares  it  to  a  barrel  that  would  hold  twenty  amphorae,  or  one  hundred %0a%3c and  eighty  gallons.  Each  shell  (B.  x.  c,  17)  is  said  to  be  fifteen  cubits %0a%3c in  size ;  which,  not  to  exceed  the  bounds  of  probability,  must  be  under- %0a%3c stood as  square  cubits.

The  Female  adheres  to  the  Male,  in %0a%3c the  Manner  of  Dogs :  she  never  produceth  more  than  two  at %0a%3c a  Birth ;  and  she  suckles  her  Young  at  her  Paps.  She  doth %0a%3c not  bring  them  to  the  Sea  before  the  twelfth  Day,  and  then %0a%3c she  accustometh  them  to  it  frequently.  It  is  difficult  to  kill %0a%3c them  unless  the  Head  is  crushed.  They  utter  a  Lowing  in %0a%3c their  Sleep,  from  whence  they  are  called  Calves.  Never- %0a%3c theless they  learn  what  is  taught  them  ;  and  they  salute  the %0a%3c People  at  the  same  Time  with  the  Voice  and  Look ;  the %0a%3c Sound  being  a  rude  Murmuring.

Of  every  one  in %0a%3c particular  we  will  speak  elsewhere :  but  now  we  are  to  treat %0a%3c of  the  Nature  of  the  principal. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  XV. %0a%3c Of  the  Names  and  Natures  of  many  Fishes. %0a%3c %0a%3c THE  Tunnies''  are  exceeding  large  Fishes:  we  have  found %0a%3c some  to  have  weighed  fifteen  Talents,  and  the  breadth  of  the %0a%3c Tail  to  be  two  Cubits  and  a  Span.  In  some  Rivers,  also,  there %0a%3c are  Fish  scarcely  of  less  size  :  as  the  Silurus3  in  the  Nile  ;  the %0a%3c Esox4  in  the  Rhine;  the  Attilus5  in  the  Po;  which  groweth  so %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  The  reader  may  consult  a  note  in  the  Wernerian  edition  of  Kay's %0a%3c "  Wisdom  of  God  in  Creation,"  p.  9 ;  where,  however,  there  is  only  an %0a%3c approximation  to  the  real  number :  to  which  should  be  added,  that  the %0a%3c fossil  species  of  animals  and  vegetables,  already  classified,  amounted,  in %0a%3c 1846,  to  about  10,000.—  Wern.

The  Ancients  were  not  at  all  particular %0a%3c in  the  discrimination  of  species ;  and,  therefore,  what  were  formerly  sup- %0a%3c posed to  be  the  different  stages  of  growth  of  the  Tunny,  are  now  known %0a%3c as  different  species.     In  confirmation  of  the  enormous  size  to  which  the %0a%3c Tunny  sometimes  attains,  Ruysch  records  an  instance  of  one  taken  near %0a%3c Cadiz  that  was  thirty-two  feet  in  length.     The  preparation  of  Tunny %0a%3c (Athenseus  says,  of  the  larger  sort)  is  referred  to  by  Martial  (B.  iii. %0a%3c Ep.  60)  as  high  and  rank  food  :  "  Teque  juvant  gerres,  et  pelle  melandrya %0a%3c cana." — Wern.

The %0a%3c Shilbe  is  also  a  fish  of  the  Nile,  of  the  same  family.    The  voracity  of  the %0a%3c Silurus  Glanis  gave  rise  to  a  proverb  :  — "  Piscem  pisci  prcedam  csse^  at %0a%3c Siluro  omnes : "  Every  fish  preys  on  some  other  one,  but  the  Silurus  on %0a%3c all.  —  Wormius.  —  Wern.

An  alteration  must, %0a%3c therefore,  have  been  made  in  the  text,  and  Rondeletius  proposes  to  read, %0a%3c "  in  Rheno :"  in  the  Rhine.  —  Wern.

Their  Young,  which  accompany  their  Dams  back %0a%3c into  the  Sea  in  the  Autumn,  are  called  Cordylae.  Afterwards %0a%3c they  begin  to  call  them  Pelamydes,1  and  Limosce,  from  the %0a%3c Mud  :  and  when  they  are  above  one  Year  old,  they  are  called %0a%3c Tunnies.  These  Tunnies  are  cut  into  Portions ;  the  Neck, %0a%3c Belly,  and  the  Throat  being  commended  for  Meat :  but %0a%3c only  when  they  are  fresh,  and  even  then  they  will  rise  on  a %0a%3c Man's  Stomach.  The  other  Parts  being  full  of  good  Meat, %0a%3c are  laid  in  Salt.  They  are  called  Melandrya,  and  when  cut %0a%3c in  Slices,  are  exceedingly  like  to  Oak  Boards.  The  worst %0a%3c Pieces  of  these  are  those  nearest  the  Tail,  because  they  are %0a%3c not  fat :  the  best  is  that  which  is  toward  the  Throat:  but  in %0a%3c other  Fishes  the  Tail-piece  (is  in  greatest  request),  as  being %0a%3c the  most  exercised.  Pelamides  are  divided  into  Parcels, %0a%3c which  are  named  Apolecti;  but  when  they  are  separated %0a%3c into  Sorts,  named  Cybii. %0a%3c %0a%3c All  Kinds  of  Fishes  grow  with  remarkable  Rapidity  to %0a%3c their  full  Size,  and  especially  in  the  Pontus :  the  Reason  is, %0a%3c because  a  number  of  Rivers  bring  fresh  Water  into  it.  There %0a%3c is  one  called  Amia,2  which  groweth  so  fast,  that  a  Man  may %0a%3c perceive  it  from  Day  to  Day.  These  Fishes,  together  with %0a%3c the  Tunnies  and  the  Pelamides,  enter  in  great  Schuls  into %0a%3c the  Pontus,  for  the  sweeter  Food  they  find  there ;  each %0a%3c Company  with  its  own  Leader:  and  before  them  all,  the %0a%3c Mackerels  lead  the  Way ;  which,  while  they  are  in  the %0a%3c Water,  have  a  Colour  of  Brimstone ;  but  out  of  it  they  are %0a%3c like  the  rest.  The  Mackerels3  fill  the  Fish-markets  in  Spain, %0a%3c when  the  Tunnies  do  not  find  their  Way  into  their  Seas. %0a%3c But  into  the  Pontus  there  enter  no  Beasts  that  injure %0a%3c Fishes,  unless  it  be  Seals  and  little  Dolphins.

Within %0a%3c the  Channel  of  the  Thracian  Bosphorus,  by  which  the  Pro- %0a%3c pontis  is  joined  to  the  Euxine,  in  the  very  Straits  of  the %0a%3c Firth  that  clivideth  Asia  from  Europe,  near  to  Chalcedon  on %0a%3c the  Side  of  Asia,  there  is  a  Rock,  exceedingly  bright,  and %0a%3c shining  in  such  a  manner  from  the  Bottom  of  the  Sea %0a%3c to  the  Top,  that  the  Tunnies  are  instantly  affrighted  at  the %0a%3c Sight ;  and  to  avoid  it,  they  rush  with  Violence  in  whole %0a%3c Flocks  towards  the  Cape  overagainst  Byzantium :  which %0a%3c Cape  on  this  Account  beareth  the  Name  of  Auricornu %0a%3c (Golden  Horn).

In  Winter  they  do  not  wander ;  but  wher- %0a%3c ever they  are  then  found,  there  they  remain  for  the  Winter, %0a%3c and  until  the  Spring  Equinox.  Many  a  Time  they  accompany %0a%3c the  Ships  that  proceed  under  Sail,  and  it  is  a  wonderful %0a%3c pleasant  Sight  to  see  them  from  the  Stern,  for  Hours  together, %0a%3c and  for  the  Space  of  several  Miles,  and  not  terrified  even %0a%3c though  the  Sailors  strike  at  them  with  the  Trident.1  Some %0a%3c People  make  a  Distinction  between  those  that  follow  the %0a%3c Ships  under  Sail  and  Tunnies,  and  call  them  Pompili.2 %0a%3c Many  of  them  pass  the  Summer  in  the  Propontis,  and %0a%3c never  enter  into  the  Pontus.

During  the  Sicilian %0a%3c War,  as  Augustus  walked  along  the  Shore,  a  Fish  leapt  out %0a%3c of  the  Sea  and  fell  at  his  Feet;  the  Prophet  (Vates)  con- %0a%3c cluding from  this  Circumstance,  that  although  Sextus  Pom- %0a%3c peius  was  at  that  Time  the  adopted  of  Father  Neptune  (so %0a%3c great  was  his  naval  Glory),  yet  those  who  had  to  this  Time %0a%3c held  the  Power  of  the  Sea  were  about  to  fall  below  the %0a%3c Feet  of  CcBsar. %0a%3c %0a%3c Female  Fishes  are  larger  than  the  Males.  And  there  are %0a%3c some  Sorts  of  them  of  which  there  are  altogether  no  Males; %0a%3c as  the  Erythini,1  and  the  Chani :  for  they  are  taken  always %0a%3c heavy  with  Spawn. %0a%3c %0a%3c Scaly  Fishes  for  the  most  part  swim  in  Schuls,  each  ac- %0a%3c cording to  its  Kind.  The  Fishing  is  before  the  Sun  is  up; %0a%3c for  then  Fishes  are  most  liable  to  be  deceived  in  their  Sight. %0a%3c If  the  Nights  are  bright,  they  see  as  well  then  as  by  Day. %0a%3c They  affirm  it  is  good  fishing  twice  in  the  same  Gulf;  for  so %0a%3c more  are  caught  in  the  second  Cast  than  by  the  first.  Fishes %0a%3c greatly  delight  in  the  Taste  of  Oil ;  and  next  to  this,  in %0a%3c gentle  Showers ;  and  with  these  they  become  fat.

Cuvier  supposes %0a%3c the  former  to  be  probably  the  Serranus  scriba:  the  latter  certainly  is %0a%3c Serranus  cabrilla.  The  following  quotation  from  the  second  edition  of %0a%3c Mr.  Yarrell's  "History  of  British  Fishes"  (vol.  i.  p.  13)  will  illustrate %0a%3c the  question,  hitherto  generally  received  in  the  affirmative,  of  the  herma- %0a%3c phroditism  of  these  fishes  : — "  Since  the  publication  of  the  first  edition  of %0a%3c this  work,  Mr.  Couch  has  been  kind  enough  to  send  me  the  roes  of  two %0a%3c specimens  of  this  Serranus  (Cabrilla).  These,  on  examination,  contained %0a%3c true  ova  only ;  and  Mr.  Owen,  of  the  College  of  Surgeons,  whose  micro- %0a%3c scope was  used  on  this  occasion,  agreed  with  me,  that  although  these %0a%3c organs  were  of  small  size,  there  was  nothing  equivocal  either  in  the %0a%3c structure  or  appearance."  —  Wern.

Now  he  is  in  no  Honour;  which  I  wonder  at, %0a%3c considering  he  is  so  seldom  to  be  found.  Some  call  him %0a%3c Elops.  Afterwards,  Cornelius  JVepos  and  Laberias  the  comic %0a%3c Poet  have  written,  that  the  Lupus  and  Asellus  obtained  the %0a%3c chief  Credit.  Of  the  Lupus,  those  that  are  the  most  com- %0a%3c mended are  those  which  are  called  Lanati,  from  the  White- %0a%3c ness and  Tenderness  of  their  Flesh.  Of  Aselli,  there  are  two %0a%3c Sorts :  Callarige,1  which  are  the  less ;  and  Bacchi,  which  are %0a%3c never  taken  but  in  deep  Water,  and  therefore  they  are  pre- %0a%3c ferred to  the  former.  But  the  Lupi  that  are  caught  in  the %0a%3c River  are  preferred  to  the  others.  The  Scarus2  hath  now %0a%3c assigned  to  it  the  chief  Place ;  and  it  is  said  to  be  the  only %0a%3c Fish  that  cheweth  the  Cud,  and  to  live  on  Herbs  and  not %0a%3c on  other  Fishes.  It  is  chiefly  found  in  the  Carpathian  Sea ; %0a%3c and  of  its  own  accord  never  passeth  the  Promontory  Lectos %0a%3c in  Troas.  When  Tiberius  Claudius  was  Sovereign,  Optatus^ %0a%3c his  Freedman  and  Admiral  of  the  Fleet,  brought  them  out  of %0a%3c that  Sea,  and  dispersed  them  between  Ostia  and  the  Coast %0a%3c of  Campania.  Care  was  taken  by  strict  Command,  for %0a%3c almost  five  Years,  that  if  any  were  taken  they  should  be %0a%3c returned  into  the  Sea.  After  this  they  were  frequently  found %0a%3c along  the  Coast  of  Italy,  whereas  before  they  had  not  been %0a%3c taken.  And  thus  Gluttony  hath  supplied  its  Taste  by  sowing %0a%3c Fish,  and  given  a  new  Inhabitant  to  the  Sea,  to  take  away %0a%3c our  Wonder  that  foreign  Birds  are  prepared  at  Rome.  Next %0a%3c to  these  Fishes,  at  least,  the  Table  is  served  with  a  Kind  of %0a%3c Mustela,3  which,  wonderful  to  say,  are  bred  in  a  Lake  of %0a%3c %0a%3c '  It  may  be,  that  the  name  Callarias  is  synonymous  with  Asellus, %0a%3c and  therefore  the  Haddock ;  but  Linneus  has  given  it  to  the  Dorse :  the %0a%3c Bacchus  is  believed  to  be  the  Cod-fish,  Gadm  morrhua  of  Linneus ; %0a%3c Morrhua  vulgaris,  Cuv.

Among %0a%3c the  Romans  this  fish  was  indispensable  at  tables  which  made  any  preten- %0a%3c sions to  fashion ;  and  at  the  same  time  it  was  the  most  costly  of  all  their %0a%3c dishes :  so  that  it  is  referred  to  by  the  poets  as  a  glaring  example  of  the %0a%3c extravagance  that  pervaded  the  city.  When  this  first  reached  the  weight %0a%3c of  two  pounds,  the  ordinary  price  was  its  own  weight  in  silver.  Horace %0a%3c mentions  as  enormous  one  which  weighed  three  pounds;  though  this %0a%3c does  not  exceed  what  the  Editor  has  seen  on  the  coast  of  Cornwall.  Two, %0a%3c which  were  caught  nearly  together,  weighed  two  and  two-and-a-quarter %0a%3c pounds  avoirdupois :  the  latter  being  precisely  the  weight  of  Horace's %0a%3c fish  of  thirty  -six  ounces.  Martial  speaks  of  a  Surmullet  of  four  pounds ; %0a%3c and  Seneca  relates  a  story  of  the  avarice  of  Tiberius,  who  sent  a  mullet %0a%3c weighing  four-and-a-half  pounds  to  market,  where,  perhaps  to  flatter  the %0a%3c emperor,  two  noblemen  contended  who  should  purchase  it ;  by  which  it %0a%3c reached  the  price  of  5000  sesterces.  Juvenal,  perhaps  with  exaggeration, %0a%3c speaks  of  one  that  weighed  six  pounds.  Suetonius  states,  that  for  three %0a%3c of  these  fishes  was  paid  at  one  time  30,000  sesterces;  and  Martial  wrote %0a%3c an  epigram  on  one  who  sold  a  servant  to  raise  the  means  of  making %0a%3c a  sumptuous  supper,  at  which  the  principal  dish,  and  the  one  that  swal- %0a%3c lowed up  the  chief  expense,  was  the  enormous  Surmullet  above-men- %0a%3c tioned. —  (B.  x.  Ep.  30.)  Those  who  wished  to  ape  the  great,  without %0a%3c sufficient  means,  were  obliged  to  be  satisfied  with  half  a  mullet.  "  Mul- %0a%3c lum  dimidium,  lapumque  totum,  mursenaeque  latus "  —  (Martial) :  the %0a%3c "  side  "  of  murasna  being  on  the  same  scale  of  stinted  luxury.  When  an %0a%3c epicure  was  asked  whether  these  prices  were  not  absurd,  he  replied  that %0a%3c two  morsels  of  the  fish  were  worth  the  expense  :  the  head  and  the  liver. %0a%3c The  latter  formed  a  delicious  sauce ;  but  the  head  must  have  been  valued %0a%3c only  because  there  was  so  little  in  it.  Attempts  were  made  to  breed  these %0a%3c fishes  in  ponds ;  but  tiiey  could  not  bear  the  confinement ;  so  that  not %0a%3c Only  did  they  cease  to  grow  in  size,  but  not  more  than  one  or  two  in  a %0a%3c thousand  continued  alive. %0a%3c %0a%3c The  fish  mentioned  at  the  beginning  of  the  next  chapter,  as  a  mullet %0a%3c of  the  Red  Sea,  must  have  been  of  another  species,  and  even  genus. — %0a%3c —  Wern.

Neither  are  those  which  keep %0a%3c near  the  Shore  in  Favour.  But  these  that  are  in  highest %0a%3c Regard  taste  like  the  (Shell-fish)  Conchy  Hum.  Fenestella %0a%3c thinks,  that  the  Name  Mullus  was  given  them  because  their %0a%3c Colour  resembles  that  of  the  purplish-red  Shoes.  They %0a%3c spawn  three  Times  in  the  Year ;  for  so  often  their  Young %0a%3c are  certainly  seen.  The  principal  Epicures  say,  that  a  Mul- %0a%3c lus, when  dying,  changeth  his  Colour,  which  may  be  seen  to %0a%3c take  a  great  Variety  of  Tints ;  passing  from  pale  by  a  Variety %0a%3c of  Mutations  to  glowing  red  all  over  his  Scales,  particularly %0a%3c if  it  be  looked  at  as  he  is  held  in  a  Glass.  M.  Apicius,  who %0a%3c was  wonderful  for  every  Ingenuity  that  belonged  to  Luxury, %0a%3c thought  it  a  most  excellent  Improvement  to  stifle  them  in %0a%3c the  Sauce  of  the  Allies,  for  this  Thing  also  hath  found  a  Sur- %0a%3c name. And  he  also  incited  them  to  contrive  a  Pickle  made %0a%3c from  their  Livers.  For  surely  it  is  more  easy  to  say  this  than %0a%3c to  set  down  who  excelled  in  it.  Asturius  Celer,  a  Man  of %0a%3c consular  Rank,  showed  his  Prodigality  in  this  Fish,  for %0a%3c when  C.  Caligula  was  Sovereign,  he  gave  for  one  Mullet %0a%3c eight  thousand  Sesterces :  the  Consideration  of  which  car- %0a%3c rieth  far  away  my  Mind  to  the  Contemplation  of  those  who, %0a%3c in  their  Reproof  of  Luxury,  complained  that  a  Cook  was %0a%3c purchased  at  a  greater  Price  than  a  Horse.  For  now  a  Cook %0a%3c will  cost  as  much  as  the  Expense  of  a  Triumph ;  and  Fishes %0a%3c are  as  dear  as  Cooks.  And  no  mortal  Man  is  esteemed  more %0a%3c than  he  who  hath  the  most  Skill  to  waste  the  Goods  and %0a%3c consume  the  Property  of  his  Lord. %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  Probably  Trigla  lineata :  a  fish  which  has  much  the  habits  of  the %0a%3c Mullus,  and  is  often  taken  in  the  same  net ;  on  which  account,  and  some %0a%3c resemblance  of  form,  it  was  called  by  the  older  naturalists,  Mullus  imberbis. %0a%3c —  Wern.

Also  this  is  the %0a%3c Nature  of  Fish,  that  some  obtain  the  Pre-eminency  in  one %0a%3c Place,  and  some  in  another :  as  the  Coracinus  in  Egypt : %0a%3c at  Gades,  the  Zeus,1  which  is  also  called  Faber :  about %0a%3c Ebusus  the  Salpa,2  which  in  other  Places  is  counted  base, %0a%3c and  which  nowhere  else  are  they  able  to  cook  unless  it  is %0a%3c first  well  beaten  with  a  Cudgel.

At  these  Gills  they  discharge  the  Water %0a%3c they  take  in  at  the  Mouth.  Hardness  of  the  Scales  is  a %0a%3c Mark  that  the  Fish  is  old ;  and  yet  all  Fishes  have  not %0a%3c Scales  alike.  There  are  two  Lakes  in  Italy,  at  the  Foot  of %0a%3c the  Alps,  named  Larius  and  Verbanus,*  in  which  there  are %0a%3c Fishes  that  every  Year  at  the  rising  of  the  Stars  Virgiliae, %0a%3c have  their  Scales  remarkable  for  the  Thickness  and  the %0a%3c Sharpness  of  their  Points  ;  much  like  the  Nails  (or  Tongues) %0a%3c of  the  military  Boots ;  and  never  longer  than  about  that %0a%3c Month  do  they  appear. %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  Zeus  faber. —  LINN.  —  Wern.

That  these  Creatures  should  have  the  Under- %0a%3c standing thus  to  know  the  Causes,  and  observe  the  Changes %0a%3c of  Times,  is  the  more  wonderful,  if  we  would  only  consider %0a%3c how  few  Men  there  are  aware  that  the  best  Season  for  fishing %0a%3c is  while  the  Sun  passeth  through  the  Sign  Pisces. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  XX. %0a%3c %0a%3c An  Arrangement  of  Fishes  according  to  the  Shape  of  their %0a%3c %0a%3c Bodies. %0a%3c %0a%3c OF  Sea- Fishes  some  are  flat,  as  Rhoinbi,  Soleae,  and %0a%3c Passeres  ;3  and  the  latter  differ  from  the  Rhombi  only  in  the %0a%3c Position  of  their  Bodies.

Only  in  the  Lake  Fucinus %0a%3c there  is  a  Fish,  which  in  swimming  useth  eight  Fins.  All %0a%3c Fishes  that  are  long  and  slippery,  as  Eels  and  Congers,  have %0a%3c ordinarily  two.  Muraenae1  have  none,  nor  any  Gills:  all  of %0a%3c these  Kinds  act  upon  the  Sea  by  bending  their  Bodies,  as %0a%3c Serpents  on  the  Land.  They  creep  also  on  dry  Land ;  and %0a%3c therefore  such  are  more  retentive  of  Life.  Also  among  flat %0a%3c Fishes  some  have  no  Fins,  as  the  Pastinaca  ;2  for  their %0a%3c Breadth  serveth  them  sufficiently  to  swim  with.

Yet  in  Winter-time  they  cannot  endure  the %0a%3c same  Exposure  in  a  small  Quantity  of  Water  ;  nor  if  it  be %0a%3c muddy ;  and  therefore  about  the  rising  of  the  Star  Virgilise %0a%3c they  are  most  abundantly  taken,  because  the  Rivers  about %0a%3c that  Time  are  the  most  muddy.

The %0a%3c Eggs  grow  very  rapidly.  The  common  People  believe  that %0a%3c they  creep  out  of  the  Water  to  the  dry  Land,  and  become %0a%3c impregnated  by  Serpents.  Aristotle  calleth  the  Male  or %0a%3c Milter,  Myrus.  The  Difference,  that  the  Mursena  is  of  a %0a%3c Variety  of  Colours,  and  weak ;  but  the  Myrus1  is  of  a  uniform %0a%3c Colour,  and  strong,  with  Teeth  projecting  beyond  his  Mouth. %0a%3c In  the  North  Parts  of  Gallia  all  the  Mursenee  have  on  their %0a%3c right  Jaw  seven  Spots,  distributed  like  the  seven  Stars  about %0a%3c the  North  Pole  (Septentrio).  These  are  of  a  golden  Colour %0a%3c so  long  as  the  Muraena  is  alive :  but  they  are  not  seen  after %0a%3c it  is  dead.  Vedius  Pollio,  a  Roman  Knight,  and  one  of  the %0a%3c Friends  of  Divus  Augustus,  contrived  Experiments  of  Cruelty %0a%3c by  Means  of  this  Creature.  For  he  caused  his  Slaves  that %0a%3c were  condemned  to  die,  to  be  thrown  into  the  Ponds  where %0a%3c his  Mursense  were  kept :  not  because  the  Wild  Beasts  of  the %0a%3c Land  were  not  sufficient  to  do  this,  but  because  in  any  other %0a%3c Way  of  Proceeding  he  would  not  have  been  able  to  view  a %0a%3c Man  plucked  in  Pieces  all  at  once,  and  at  his  Leisure.  It  is %0a%3c said,  that  if  they  taste  Vinegar  they  are  driven  to  Madness. %0a%3c They  have  a  very  thin  Skin  ;  and,  on  the  contrary,  Eels  have %0a%3c it  thick  :  so  that  Verrius  writeth,  that  Children  under  seven %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  The  Myrus  is  a  distinct  species,  Mur.  myrus,  LINN,  and  Cuv.

All  this  kind  in  general  Aristotle %0a%3c was  the  first  to  call  in  Greek  Selache  :  we  cannot  distinguish %0a%3c them  by  this  Name,  unless  we  are  permitted  to  call  them %0a%3c Cartilaginous  Fishes.  But  all  the  Sort  of  them  that  devour %0a%3c Flesh  are  such ;  and  they  feed  as  they  lie  supine,  like  as  we %0a%3c observed  in  the  Dolphins.  And  whereas  other  Fishes  cast %0a%3c Spawn,  this  Class  only,  in  the  same  manner  as  those %0a%3c which  we  call  Cete,1  bring  forth  their  Young  alive ;  with  the %0a%3c Exception,  however,  of  that  one  which  they  call  Rana. %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  The  name  of  Cete  is  here  mentioned  as  equivalent  to  Balaena  for %0a%3c the  Whales,  ch.  6 :  but  the  mode  in  which  they  bear  their  young  is  very %0a%3c different  from  that  of  the  cartilaginous  fishes,  though  both,  or  at  least  the %0a%3c Sharks  among  the  latter,  are  viviparous.  The  Whales  are  placental %0a%3c animals,  but  all  true  fishes  produce  eggs,  although  in  some  instances  they %0a%3c are  hatched  within  the  body  of  the  parent. %0a%3c %0a%3c The  fishes  here  mentioned  are :  Eaia,  —  several  species  of  Rays  and %0a%3c Skates ;  Pastinaca,  mentioned  before,  ch.  20 ;  Squatina,  Squalus  squatina, %0a%3c Linn.,  and  Squatina  vulgaris^  Cuv. ;  the  Monk,  or  Angel-fish ;  and  Tor- %0a%3c pedo, ch.  16.

It  is  believed  that  if  it  adhere  to %0a%3c the  Keel  of  a  Ship  it  goeth  the  more  slowly ;  and  from  this %0a%3c it  took  its  Name :  for  the  same  Cause  also  it  hath  a  bad %0a%3c Reputation  for  its  use  in  amatory  Medicines,  and  in  causing %0a%3c Delay  of  Actions  at  Law  and  judicial  Decisions.  But  both %0a%3c these  Offences  are  counterbalanced  by  one  commendation :  for %0a%3c it  restraineth  Haemorrhage  threatening  Abortion  in  pregnant %0a%3c Women,  and  holdeth  the  Child  to  the  full  Time  of  Birth. %0a%3c Notwithstanding,  it  is  not  allowed  to  be  eaten.

These  Shells  adhered  to  a  Ship %0a%3c conveying  Messengers  from  Periander  with  Commission  to %0a%3c emasculate  the  Noblemen's  Sons,  and  caused  it  to  remain %0a%3c still,  although  it  was  under  Sail  with  a  strong  Gale.  And %0a%3c the  Shells  which  accomplished  this  are  Objects  of  Worship %0a%3c in  the  Temple  of  Venus  of  the  Gnidians. %0a%3c %0a%3c Trebius  Niger  saith  that  the  Echeneis  is  a  Foot  long,  and %0a%3c five  Fingers  thick  ;  that  it  hinders  the  Progress  of  a  Ship ; %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  The  proper  Echeneis  is  the  E.  remora.  Linn.;  but  from  its  pos- %0a%3c sessing similar,  or  even  firmer  powers  of  adhesion,  though  by  a  different %0a%3c organ,  it  was  confounded  with  the  larger  Lamprey,  Petrornyzon  marinus. %0a%3c From  allusion  to  the  feet,  Aristotle,  as  well  as  Gesner,  who  follows  him, %0a%3c appears  to  include  in  the  same  class  a  species  of  Cyclopterus ;  of  which %0a%3c there  is  one  that  adheres  with  more  facility,  although  with  less  firmness. %0a%3c We  cannot  avoid  believing  that  the  popular  impression  concerning  this %0a%3c fish  was  often  laid  hold  of  as  an  excuse,  in  some  of  the  instances  where  an %0a%3c unpleasant  task  had  been  slowly  performed  or  entirely  counteracted.  The %0a%3c narrative  of  Antony's  delay  at  the  battle  of  Actium  (see  B.  xxxii.  c.  1 .) %0a%3c will  only  excite  a  smile  in  those  who  consider  the  much  more  formidable %0a%3c attraction  that  existed  at  the  time.  — Wern.

Of  them  there  are  three  Sorts.  First,  those  which %0a%3c are  called  Soft :  secondly,  such  as  are  covered  with  thin %0a%3c Crusts :  and  in  the  last  Place,  they  that  are  enclosed  within %0a%3c hard  Shells.  The  soft  are  reckoned  the  Loligo,  Sepia,  Poly- %0a%3c pus, and  the  rest  of  that  Sort.  These  have  their  Head  between %0a%3c their  Feet  and  the  Belly,  and  every  one  of  them  has  eight %0a%3c Feet.  The  Sepia  and  Loligo  have  each  two  Feet,  very  long %0a%3c and  rough ;  by  which  they  convey  Meat  to  their  Mouths : %0a%3c and  also  stay  themselves  as  with  an  Anchor  against  the %0a%3c Waves.  The  rest  of  their  Feet  are  Tendrils,  with  which  they %0a%3c catch  their  Prey. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  XXIX.2 %0a%3c Of  the  Loligo,3  Sepia,4*  Polypus,5  and  Nautilus? %0a%3c %0a%3c ALSO  the  Loligo  flies,  springing  out  of  the  Water  as  if %0a%3c he  were  an  Arrow ;  and  even  Pectunculi  do  the  same.

The  story  of  hoisting  its  membranous %0a%3c sails  to  the  wind  is  found  to  be  an  error :  the  use  of  these  parts  being  to %0a%3c clasp  the  sides  of  the  shell  as  it  swims.    It  was  the  Polypus  chiefly  that %0a%3c was  so  highly  prized  as  food  by  the  Greeks,  but  it  was  necessary  to  bruise %0a%3c it  well  before  it  was  cooked.    The  Loligo  was  also  employed  in  the  same %0a%3c manner ;  as  it  is  at  this  day.  —  Wern.  Club. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BOOK  IX.]  History  of  Nature.  143 %0a%3c %0a%3c Males  of  the  Sepia  kind  are  mottled,  and  blacker,  as  well  as %0a%3c more  firm,  than  the  Female.  If  the  Female  be  smitten  with %0a%3c a  Trident,  they  will  help  her  ;  but  if  the  Male  be  struck,  she %0a%3c flies.  But  both  of  them,  when  they  perceive  that  they  are %0a%3c laid  hold  of,  throw  out  a  Quantity  of  Ink,  which  is  in  the %0a%3c Place  of  Blood  to  them  ;  and  when  the  Water  is  obscured %0a%3c with  it  they  hide  themselves  by  means  of  it. %0a%3c %0a%3c Of  Polypi  there  are  many  Kinds.  They  that  keep  near %0a%3c the  Shore  are  bigger  than  those  that  haunt  the  Deep.  All %0a%3c of  them  employ  their  Arms  in  the  manner  of  Feet  and %0a%3c Hands ;  but  the  Tail,  which  is  sharp  and  two-forked,  serveth %0a%3c them  in  their  Coupling.  The  Polypi  have  a  Pipe  in  their %0a%3c Back,  by  which  they  throw  out  the  Sea :  and  it  they  can %0a%3c shift,  one  while  to  the  right  Side,  and  another  to  the  left. %0a%3c They  swim  obliquely  on  their  Head,  which  is  very  hard  by %0a%3c being  blown  up  while  they  are  alive.  Moreover,  by  hollow %0a%3c Concavities,  arranged  along  their  Arms,  they  will  adhere,  as %0a%3c it  were  by  sucking,  to  any  Thing ;  which  they  hold  so  fast %0a%3c (lying  upward  with  their  Bellies)  that  they  cannot  be %0a%3c plucked  from  it.  They  never  fasten  on  the  Bottom;  and %0a%3c the  greater  they  are,  the  less  strong  they  are  to  hold  any %0a%3c Thing.  Of  all  soft  (Fishes)  they  alone  go  out  of  the  Water  to %0a%3c dry  Land,  at  least  into  some  rough  Place;  for  they  cannot %0a%3c abide  those  that  are  smooth.  They  devour  the  Flesh  of  Shell- %0a%3c fishes, the  Shells  of  which  they  break  by  the  Compression  of %0a%3c their  Tendrils  ;  and  therefore  the  Place  where  they  lie  may %0a%3c be  detected  by  the  Number  of  Shells  that  lie  before  their %0a%3c Place.  And  though  in  other  Respects  it  may  be  regarded  as %0a%3c a  very  senseless  Creature,  so  that  it  will  swim  to  a  Man's %0a%3c Hand,  yet  in  what  concerns  its  Family  Affairs  it  possesses %0a%3c Understanding:  for  all  they  can  take  they  carry  to  their %0a%3c Home ;  and  when  they  have  eaten  the  Meat  of  the  Tishes %0a%3c they  throw  away  the  empty  Shells,  and  watch  to  catch  the %0a%3c little  Fishes  that  approach  them.  They  change  their  Colour %0a%3c to  that  of  the  Place  where  they  are,  and  especially  when %0a%3c under  the  Influence  of  Fear.  That  they  gnaw  their  own %0a%3c Arms  is  a  great  Error;  for  they  owe  this  Injury  to  the  Con- %0a%3c gers :  but  it  is  scarcely  false  that  they  will  grow  again,  like %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 144  History  of  Nature.

But  among  the  greatest %0a%3c Wonders  of  Nature,  is  that  Creature  which  by  some  is  called %0a%3c Nautilos,  by  others  Pompilos.  It  comes  to  the  Surface  of %0a%3c the  Water  upon  its  Back,  so  that  it  raiseth  or  heaveth  itself %0a%3c up  by  little  and  little ;  and  that  it  may  swim  with  Ease,  it %0a%3c dischargeth  all  the  Water  through  a  Pipe,  as  if  it  were %0a%3c unloaded  by  a  Pump,  After  this,  turning  back  the  two  fore- %0a%3c most Arms,  it  stretcheth  out  between  them  a  Membrane  of %0a%3c wonderful  thinness ;  which  serve th  it  for  a  Sail  in  the  Air, %0a%3c whilst  with  the  rest  of  its  Arms  it  roweth  under  Water ;  and %0a%3c with  the  Tail  in  the  midst  it  directeth  its  Course,  as  with  an %0a%3c Helm.  Thus  does  it  make  its  Way  in  the  Deep  with  the %0a%3c Imitation  of  a  little  Boat,  and  if  any  Thing  alarm  it  with  a %0a%3c Draught  of  Water  it  sinks  itself  to  the  Bottom. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  XXX. %0a%3c %0a%3c Of  the  Ozcena,  the  Nauplius,  and  Locustce. %0a%3c %0a%3c THE  Ozsena1  is  a  kind  of  Polypus,  and  it  derives  its  Name %0a%3c from  the  strong  Smell  of  its  Head  ;  from  which  Cause  espe- %0a%3c cially the  Mursenae  pursue  it.  The  Polypi  lie  hid  for  two %0a%3c Months,  and  do  not  live  above  two  Years.  They  always  die %0a%3c of  a  Consumption  :  the  Female  sooner  than  the  Males,  and %0a%3c ordinarily  after  they  have  brought  forth  their  Young.  I %0a%3c cannot  pass  over  the  Reports  of  Trebius  Niger,  one  of  the %0a%3c Retinue  of  L.  Lucullus,  Proconsul  in  Boetica,  which  he  deli- %0a%3c vered as  collected  by  the  latter  concerning  these  Polypi : %0a%3c that  they  are  exceedingly  greedy  after  Conchaj  (Cockles, %0a%3c Mussels,  and  such-like  Shell-fishes) :  and  that  they,  as  soon %0a%3c as  they  feel  themselves  touched,  shut  their  Shells,  and  so  cut %0a%3c off  their  Arms,  and  thus  feed  upon  those  which  sought  to %0a%3c make  a  Prey  of  them.  These  Shell-fishes  are  without  Sight, %0a%3c and  every  other  Sense,  but  those  of  tasting  their  Meat %0a%3c and  Sensibility  to  Danger.  These  Polypi  lie  in  wait  for %0a%3c Cockles  as  they  gape  wide  open,  and  put  in  a  little  Stone %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  Eledone  moschatus.  —  Cuv.

Moreover,  Trebius  Niger  affirmeth  that  there %0a%3c is  no  other  Creature  so  dangerous  to  destroy  a  Man  in  the %0a%3c Water ;  for  it  catcheth  him  fast  in  its  Embrace,  and  sucks %0a%3c him  with  the  Cups,  so  that  it  exhausts  him  with  the  Num- %0a%3c ber of  its  drawing  Instruments,  at  such  a  Time  as  it  has %0a%3c obtained  an  Advantage  over  those  which  are  shipwrecked, %0a%3c or  are  engaged  in  diving.  But  if  it  be  turned  upside  down, %0a%3c its  Strength  is  soon  gone  ;  for  then  they  stretch  themselves %0a%3c out  on  their  Back.  And  truly  also,  all  Creatures  in  the %0a%3c Sea  are  attracted  by  their  Smell,  which  is  the  Cause  that %0a%3c Fishermen  besmear  their  Traps  with  them. %0a%3c %0a%3c Other  Things  which  this  Author  hath  related  may  seem %0a%3c rather  like  something  monstrous  ;  for  he  affirmeth,  that  at %0a%3c Carteia  there  was  one  which  used  to  go  from  the  Sea  into %0a%3c their  open  Cisterns,  among  their  Ponds,  and  there  rob  them %0a%3c of  their  salt  Fish ;  and  this  Thievery  was  so  enormous  and %0a%3c long  continued,  that  it  gat  itself  the  great  Displeasure  of %0a%3c the  Keepers.  Fences  were  erected  to  stop  the  Passage,  but %0a%3c these  it  passed  over  by  means  of  a  Tree  ;  nor  could  it  have %0a%3c been  taken  but  by  the  Sagacity  of  the  Dogs  :  for  as  it  was %0a%3c returning  one  Night,  they  set  upon  it  on  all  Sides,  and  so %0a%3c raised  the  Keepers,  who  were  affrighted  at  the  strange %0a%3c Sight.  For,  first  of  all,  it  was  of  unheard-of  bigness;  then %0a%3c its  Colour  was  covered  over  with  the  Pickle,  and  the  Stink %0a%3c was  horrible.  Who  would  have  looked  for  a  Polypus  there, %0a%3c or  have  known  it  in  such  a  condition  ?  They  thought  they %0a%3c had  to  encounter  with  some  Monster :  for  with  its  terrible %0a%3c Vapour  it  drove  away  the  Dogs;  and  with  the  Ends  of  its %0a%3c long  Tendrils  it  would  lash  them ;  sometimes  with  its %0a%3c stronger  Arms  it  knocked  them,  as  with  Clubs  ;  so  that  it %0a%3c was  with  Difficulty  they  were  able  to  kill  it  with  several %0a%3c three-pronged  Spears.

The %0a%3c Cavities  or  Cups,  and  hollow  Vessels,  were  like  great %0a%3c Basins ;  and  the  Teeth  were  conspicuous  for  their  size.  The %0a%3c Remains  were  preserved  for  a  Wonder,  and  weighed  seven %0a%3c hundred  Pounds.  The  same  Author  affirmeth  that  Sepiae %0a%3c also,  and  the  Loligo,  have  been  cast  upon  that  Shore,  full  as %0a%3c big.  Indeed,  in  our  Sea,  Loligines  are  taken  of  five  Cubits %0a%3c long,  and  Sepiae  of  two :  and  these  do  not  live  above  two %0a%3c Years.1 %0a%3c %0a%3c Mutianus  reporteth,  that  himself  saw  in  Propontis  ano- %0a%3c ther kind,  having  the  Likeness  of  one  carrying  a  Ship  :  that %0a%3c it  was  a  Shell-fish,  with  a  Keel  like  that  of  a  Barge,  with  a %0a%3c Poop  turned  inward  ;  the  Prow  with  a  Beak.  Within  this %0a%3c lay  hid  the  Nauplius,  an  Animal  resembling  a  Sepia,  only  to %0a%3c play  with  it  for  Company.  And  this  was  done  in  two  Ways : %0a%3c for  when  it  is  calm,  the  Passenger  would  put  down  its  Feet, %0a%3c and  row  as  with  Oars ;  but  if  the  Breeze  invited,  it  would %0a%3c stretch  out  the  same  to  serve  for  a  Rudder  ;  and  then  the %0a%3c Cavity  of  the  Shell  would  be  spread  to  the  Wind.  So  one  of %0a%3c them  takes,  a  Pleasure  to  carry,  and  the  other  to  direct;  and %0a%3c they  unite  to  sink  the  Shell  :  though  both  are  destitute  of %0a%3c Sense  ;  unless,  indeed,  Misfortune  be  intended  to  Man  :  a %0a%3c sad  Presage,  as  is  well  known  to  Sailors. %0a%3c %0a%3c Locustae2  (being  of  that  Kind  which  wanteth  Blood)  are %0a%3c defended  with  a  brittle  Crust.

All  of  this  Family  decline  in  the  Win- %0a%3c ter; but  in  Autumn  and  Spring  they  grow  fat;  and  espe- %0a%3c cially when  the  Moon  is  full,  because  by  Night  that  Star  is %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  A  general  name  for  the  short-tailed  crustaceans,  which  comprise  the %0a%3c crabs ;  but  individually  Cancer  pagurus,  LINN.  :  The  edible  crab.  The %0a%3c other  species  are:  Maja:  Cancer  squinado,  LINN.;  Maia  Sq.,  Cuv.;  some- %0a%3c times seen  on  Greek  coins,  and  supposed  to  be  endowed  with  more  wis- %0a%3c dom than  other  crustaceans.  It  was  sensible  to  the  charms  of  music,  and %0a%3c jJElian  says  of  the  Pagurus  (which,  as  expressing  this  crab,  may  include %0a%3c this  species),  that  fishermen  employed  the  music  of  the  Photingium  to %0a%3c allure  them  out  of  the  water.

Of  Crabs  there  are  many %0a%3c kinds  :  as  Carabi,  Astaci,  Majae,  Paguri,  Heracleotici, %0a%3c Leones,  and  others  that  are  less  esteemed.  The  Carabi %0a%3c differ  from  other  Crabs  in  the  Tail.  In  Phoenicia  there  is  a %0a%3c kind  called  Hippoe,  which  are  so  swifr,  that  it  is  impossible %0a%3c to  overtake  them.  Crabs  live  long  :  they  have  eight  Feet, %0a%3c all  turned  obliquely  :  the  Female  hath  the  Fore-foot  double, %0a%3c the  Male  single.  Moreover,  two  of  their  Arms  have  toothed %0a%3c Pincers.  The  upper  Part  of  these  Fore-claws  is  moveable  ; %0a%3c the  lower  Part  doth  not  move.  The  right  Ann  in  all  is  the %0a%3c larger.  When  they  come  in  Sculls  together,  sometimes %0a%3c they  are  not  able  to  pass  the  Mouth  of  the  Pontus  ;  for %0a%3c which  Reason  they  return  and  fetch  a  Compass,  so  that  the %0a%3c beaten  Way  may  be  seen.  The  least  of  all  these  kind  of %0a%3c Crabs  is  called  Pinnotheres1 ;  and  on  this  Account  it  is  the %0a%3c most  exposed  to  Injury.  But  it  possesses  the  Wisdom  to %0a%3c hide  itself  within  the  Shells  of  empty  Oysters  ;  and  as  it %0a%3c groweth  bigger,  it  changes  its  Quarters  to  larger  ones. %0a%3c Crabs,  when  they  are  afraid,  will  run  backward  as  fast  as %0a%3c they  went  forward.  They  fight  with  one  another,  and  then %0a%3c butt  with  their  Horns  like  Rams.  They  are  a  Remedy %0a%3c against  the  Stings  of  Serpents.  It  is  reported,  that  while  the %0a%3c Sun  is  passing  the  Sign  Cancer,  the  Bodies  of  dead  Crabs %0a%3c that  lie  on  the  dry  Land  are  turned  into  Scorpions.  Of  the %0a%3c same  Class  are  the  Echini  ;2  which  have  Spines  instead  of %0a%3c Feet.  Their  Manner  of  going  is  to  roll  themselves  round; %0a%3c and,  therefore,  many  Times  they  are  found  with  their  Spines %0a%3c rubbed  off.  Of  the  same  Sort  are  those  which  are  called %0a%3c Echinometrse,  which  have  the  longest  Spines  and  the %0a%3c smallest  Cases.  Neither  are  they  alt  of  the  same  glassy %0a%3c Colour;  for  those  produced  about Torone  are  white,  and  have %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  Or  Pinnoteres. %0a%3c %0a%3c a  Professor  Edward  Forbes  believes  the  species  intended  by  Pliny  to %0a%3c be  E.  limdusj  and  Echinometra,  Echinus  esculentus.  But  in  regard  to %0a%3c the  latter  there  is  some  doubt.  Ruysch  represents  it  as  having  a  small %0a%3c cup  and  long  spines.  One  that  is  elongated,  with  soft,  weak  spines,  is %0a%3c Amphidelus  Mediterraneus  ;  and  a  little  species  with  long  spines,  Cidaris %0a%3c histrix.

It  is  said  that  they  foretell  the %0a%3c raging  of  the  Sea :  for  they  labour  to  gather  Stones,  by  the %0a%3c Weight  of  which  to  fix  themselves  from  being  rolled  over: %0a%3c for  they  dread  to  have  their  Spines  worn  off  by  being %0a%3c tossed  about ;  and  when  the  Sailors  have  seen  this,  they %0a%3c immediately  moor  their  Ships  with  many  Anchors. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  XXXII. %0a%3c Of  Cochlea.1 %0a%3c %0a%3c IN  the  same  Rank  are  the  Cochleae,  both  of  the  Land %0a%3c and  Water ;  which  stretch  themselves  out  of  their  Habi- %0a%3c tation, and  extend  or  withdraw  two  Horns.

For %0a%3c now,  of  all  the  Things  in  Nature,  nothing  is  so  destructive  as %0a%3c the  Sea,  in  so  many  Fashions,  such  Variety  of  Tables,  such %0a%3c different  Tastes  in  Fishes ;  which  bear  a  Price  according  to %0a%3c the  Danger  of  obtaining  them. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  XXXV. %0a%3c Of  Pearls ;  how  and  where  they  are  found. %0a%3c %0a%3c BUT  what  is  this  to  those  who  consider  the  Purpurse,1 %0a%3c Conchylise,  and  Pearls  ?  It  was,  therefore,  but  a  little  Matter %0a%3c to  bring  the  Seas  into  the  Throat,  unless  Men  and  Women %0a%3c might  carry  them  about  on  their  Hands,  and  Ears,  Head, %0a%3c and  all  over  the  Body.

And  be  it  that  there  is  so  great  a  Fellowship  with %0a%3c it  and  our  Bellies ;  what  Fellowship  with  the  Back  ?  But %0a%3c we  are  not  contented  to  be  fed  with  so  many  Perils,  we  must %0a%3c be  clad  with  them  also.  So  throughout  the  whole  Body, %0a%3c that  which  is  obtained  with  the  utmost  Hazard  is  most %0a%3c regarded  by  the  Mind  of  Man.  The  principal  and  summit %0a%3c of  all  these  Things,  as  regards  the  Price,1  are  Pearls.  The %0a%3c Indian  Ocean  sends  the  chief  Supply  :  and  they  are  searched %0a%3c for  amongst  those  many  and  terrible  Beasts  which  we  have %0a%3c spoken  of  before  ;2  we  must  pass  over  so  many  Seas,  through %0a%3c so  great  an  Extent  of  Countries,  where  the  Heat  of  the  Sun %0a%3c is  excessive  :  even  the  Indians  themselves  go  to  seek  them %0a%3c among  the  Islands,  and  even  then  meet  with  very  few.  The %0a%3c greatest  Plenty  is  found  in  Taprobane  and  Toidis,  as  hath %0a%3c been  said  in  our  Review  of  the  World  :  and  likewise  about %0a%3c Perimula,  a  Promontory  of  India.  But  they  are  praised  as %0a%3c the  most  perfect,  which  are  obtained  about  Arabia,  within %0a%3c the  Persian  Gulf  of  the  Red  Sea.  The  Origin  and  Mode  of %0a%3c breeding  of  this  Shell  differ  not  much  from  that  of  the %0a%3c Shells  of  Oysters :  for  when  the  Season  of  the  Year  urgeth %0a%3c them,  they  spread  themselves  with  a  Kind  of  Gaping,  and %0a%3c then  are  said  to  be  filled  with  a  prolific  Dew,  with  which %0a%3c they  grow  pregnant :  and  the  Fruit  of  which  these  Shell- %0a%3c fishes are  delivered  are  these  Pearls,  according  to  the  Qua- %0a%3c lity of  the  Dew  which  they  received.  For  if  the  Dew  were %0a%3c pure  which  went  into  them,  the  Pearls  are  white  and  bril- %0a%3c liant ;  if  muddy,  the  Product  likewise  is  foul  :  it  is  pale, %0a%3c also,  if  the  Weather  were  threatening  at  the  Time  of  Con- %0a%3c ception. Whereby,  no  doubt,  it  is  plain  that  they  have  more %0a%3c Affinity  with  the  Sky  than  with  the  Sea :  for,  according  as %0a%3c the  Morning  is  fair,  they  are  clear ;  or  foul,  if  that  was %0a%3c cloudy.  If  they  have  Time  to  feed  sufficiently,  the  Pearls, %0a%3c also,  will  grow  large  ;  but  if  there  be  Lightning,  they  close %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  At  the  opening  of  the  4th  chapter  of  the  37th  Book,  our  author  tells %0a%3c us  that  diamonds  bear  the  highest  price.  —  Wern.

I %0a%3c wonder  that  they  so  greatly  rejoice  in  the  Air;  for  with  the %0a%3c Sun  they  become  red,  and  lose  their  Whiteness,  just  like  the %0a%3c Body  of  a  Man.  Therefore  those  Shells  that  keep  in  the %0a%3c main  Sea,  and  lie  deeper  than  the  Sunbeams  can  pierce  to %0a%3c them,  have  the  finest  Pearls.  And  even  these  become  yellow %0a%3c with  Age,  and  dull  with  Wrinkles;  so  that  the  Lustre  which %0a%3c is  so  much  sought  for,  only  continued!  during  their  Youth. %0a%3c When  they  are  old,  they  grow  thick,  and  stick  fast  to  the %0a%3c Shells,  so  that  they  cannot  be  separated  but  with  a  File. %0a%3c These  have  only  one  Face,  and  from  that  Side  are  round  ; %0a%3c for  the  back  Part  is  flat ;  for  which  Reason  such  are  called %0a%3c Tympania.  We  may  see  them  growing  together  in  these %0a%3c Shells  which  serve  to  carry  Ointments.1  There  is  a  Pearl %0a%3c that,  is  soft  when  in  the  Water,  but  when  taken  out  it  pre- %0a%3c sently hardeneth.  When  this  Shell  perceiveth  the  Hand, %0a%3c it  shutteth  itself,  and  so  covereth  over  her  Riches,  being %0a%3c aware  that  it  is  for  these  she  is  sought  after.  But  if  the %0a%3c Hand  come  in  the  Way  of  the  Shell,  it  will  be  cut  off  by  its %0a%3c sharp  Edge  ;  and  the  Punishment  cannot  be  more  just, %0a%3c although  she  is  armed  with  other  Means  of  Revenge.  For %0a%3c they  keep  for  the  most  Part  about  Rocks  ;  and  if  they  are %0a%3c in  deep  Water  they  are  accompanied  with  Sea-dogs.  And %0a%3c yet  all  this  will  not  keep  them  away  from  the  Ears  of  the %0a%3c Ladies.  Some  say  that,  like  Bees,  every  Company  of  these %0a%3c Shells  has  one  Chief,  distinguished  for  his  Size  and  Age, %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  These  boxes,  made  of  beautifully -coloured  shells,  and  ornamented %0a%3c with  rare  pearls,  for  holding  precious  unguents,  will  remind  the  reader  of %0a%3c the  alabaster  box  for  the  same  purpose  spoken  of  in  the  Gospels.  From %0a%3c what  Pliny  says  of  these  alabaster  boxes,  they  must  have  been  turned %0a%3c with  a  lathe.  —  Wern.

These  the  Divers  use  their %0a%3c Efforts  to  obtain  ;  for  if  they  are  caught  the  rest  are  scat- %0a%3c tered, and  are  easily  taken  in  the  Nets.  When  thus  obtained, %0a%3c they  are  put  into  earthen  Pots,  and  covered  with  Salt;  and %0a%3c when  all  the  Flesh  is  consumed,  certain  Kernels  within  their %0a%3c Bodies,  that  is,  the  Pearls  themselves,  fall  down  to  the  Bot- %0a%3c tom. There  is  no  Doubt  but  they  will  become  worn,  and %0a%3c change  their  Colour,  if  they  be  not  well  looked  to.  Their %0a%3c Reputation  jconsisteth  in  their  brilliant  Whiteness,  Size, %0a%3c Roundness,  Smoothness,  and  Weight :  Qualities  not  readily %0a%3c found,  insomuch  that  it  is  impossible  to  find  two  perfectly %0a%3c fitted  together.  And  hence  it  is  that  our  very  elegant  People %0a%3c at  Rome  have  given  them  this  Name  of  Uniones.  For  the %0a%3c Greeks  have  no  such  Terms  for  them  :  nor  among  the  Bar- %0a%3c barians, who  discovered  them,  is  there  any  other  Name  than %0a%3c Margaritas.  In  the  very  Whiteness  itself  there  is  a  great %0a%3c Difference  among  them.  That  which  is  found  in  the  Red %0a%3c Sea  is  the  clearer  The  Indian  Pearl  resembleth  the  Plates %0a%3c of  the  Stone  called  Specularis  ;  but  otherwise  it  excels  all %0a%3c others  in  Magnitude.  The  greatest  Commendation  of  their %0a%3c Colour  is  to  be  called  Exalumiuatrse.  They  that  are  more %0a%3c lengthened  are  commendable  in  their  Degree.  For  those %0a%3c that  are  elongated  and  pointed  at  the  Top,  and  grow  into  a %0a%3c full  Globe  at  the  Bottom,  in  the  Shape  of  Alabaster  Boxes, %0a%3c are  favoured  with  the  Name  of  Elenchi.  The  Ladies  take %0a%3c great  Pride  to  have  these  dangling  from  their  Fingers, %0a%3c and  two  or  three  pendent  at  their  Ears.  There  is  Luxury %0a%3c conveyed  in  the  Names  they  have  devised  for  these,  and %0a%3c wanton  Excess  in  what  they  carry  about;  for  when  they %0a%3c knock  one  against  another  they  call  them  Crotalia  (Cym- %0a%3c bals), as  if  they  delighted  to  hear  the  Sound  of  their  Pearls %0a%3c rattling  together.  Now,  also,  poor  People  affect  to  wear %0a%3c them ;  and  it  is  a  Saying  among  them,  that  a  fair  Pearl  is  to %0a%3c a  Woman  instead  of  a  Lictor.1  Nay,  upon  the  Feet,  also, %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  That  is,  they  are  a  warrant  of  her  rank,  and  so  make  way  for  her  in %0a%3c a  crowd.  —  Wern.

King  Juba,  also,  hath  recorded,  that  on %0a%3c the  Arabian  Coasts  there  is  a  Kind  of  Shell  like  a  notched %0a%3c Pecten,  but  rough,  something  like  the  Echinus ;  and  this %0a%3c beareth  Pearls  in  the  Flesh  like  a  Hailstone.

That  they  are  solid  in  their  Substance,  is %0a%3c evident  by  this,  that  with  no  Fall  will  they  break.  But  they %0a%3c are  not  always  found  in  the  Middle  of  the  Flesh,  but  some- %0a%3c times in  one  Place,  and  sometimes  in  another.  I  have  seen %0a%3c them  at  the  very  Edges,  as  if  they  were  going  out  of  the %0a%3c Shell ;  and  in  some  four,  in  others  five  together.  Unto  this %0a%3c Day  few  have  been  known  to  weigh  above  half  an  Ounce %0a%3c and  a  Scruple.  In  Britain  it  is  certain  that  some  are  pro- %0a%3c duced, but  they  are  small  and  dim,  of  Colour  :  for  Divus %0a%3c Julius  wished  it  to  be  understood  that  the  Breastplate  which %0a%3c he  dedicated  to  Venus  Genetrix  in  her  Temple,  was  made  of %0a%3c British  Pearls. %0a%3c %0a%3c I  myself  have  seen  Lollia  Paulina,  who  was  the  Wife  of %0a%3c the  Prince  Caius,  not  when  she  was  dressed  in  State,  or  for %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  Myse :  Pinna : — gaping  Bivalves,  still  known  to  science  by  the  same %0a%3c names.

The %0a%3c Value  of  these  Ornaments  she  rated  at  400  hundred  thousand %0a%3c Sestertii  ;l  and  offered  to  prove  it  immediately  by  her  Books %0a%3c of  Accounts.  Yet  these  Jewels  were  not  the  Gifts  of  the %0a%3c prodigal  Prince,  but  the  Riches  of  her  own  Ancestors,  that %0a%3c is,  the  Product  of  the  Spoiling  of  the  Provinces.  This  is %0a%3c the  Issue  of  those  Depredations  ;  this  it  was  for  which %0a%3c M.  Lollius  was  reproached  through  all  the  East  for  receiving %0a%3c Presents  from  the  Kings  ;  and  being  forbidden  the  Friend- %0a%3c ship of  C.  Ccesar,  Son  of  Augustus,  he  drank  Poison,  that %0a%3c his  Niece  should  be  gazed  at  by  Lamp-light  as  she  was %0a%3c covered  with  the  Value  of  Jewels  of  400  hundred  thousand %0a%3c Sestertii. %0a%3c %0a%3c On  the  other  Hand,  let  any  Man  reckon  how  much %0a%3c Curius  or  Fabricius  bore  in  their  Triumphs ;  let  him  imagine %0a%3c what  their  Shows  were:  and  on  the  other  Side,  make  an %0a%3c Estimate  of  Lollia,  one  only  Woman,  allied  to  the  Emperor, %0a%3c reclining ;  would  not  he  wish  rather  that  they  had  been %0a%3c pulled  out  of  their  Chariots  than  to  have  conquered  only  for %0a%3c this  ?  And  yet  this  is  not  the  greatest  Example  of  excessive %0a%3c Prodigality. %0a%3c %0a%3c There  were  two  Pearls,  the  very  largest  that  ever  were %0a%3c known  in  any  Age,  and  they  were  possessed  by  Cleopatra, %0a%3c the  last  Queen  of  Egypt ;  having  descended  to  her  by  means %0a%3c of  the  Kings  of  the  East.  When  Antony  had  feasted  her %0a%3c Day  by  Day  very  sumptuously,  and  under  the  Influence, %0a%3c at  one  Time,  of  Pride  and  petulant  Disdain,  as  a  Royal %0a%3c Harlot,  after  undervaluing  his  Expense  and  Provision,  he %0a%3c demanded  how  it  was  possible  to  go  beyond  this  Magni- %0a%3c ficence :  she  replied,  that  she  would  consume,  in  one  Supper, %0a%3c 100  hundred  thousand  Sestertii.2  Antony  desired  to  learn %0a%3c how  that  could  be  possible,  but  he  thought  it  was  not. %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  Forty,  millions.  3  Ten  millions. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 1 56  History  of  Nature.  [BooK  IX . %0a%3c %0a%3c Wagers  were,  therefore,  laid  ;  and  on  the  following  Day, %0a%3c when  the  Decision  was  to  be  made  (for  that  a  Day  might %0a%3c not  be  lost,  Antony  appointed  the  next  succeeding  one),  she %0a%3c provided  a  Supper,  which  was,  on  the  whole,  sumptuous ; %0a%3c but  Antony  laughed  at  it,  and  required  to  see  an  Account  of %0a%3c the  Particulars.  But  she  said,  that  what  had  been  served  up %0a%3c already  was  but  the  Over-measure,  and  affirmed  still,  that %0a%3c she  would  in  that  Supper  make  up  the  full  Sum ;  and  her- %0a%3c self alone  consume  in  this  Supper  600  huudred  thousand %0a%3c Sestertii.1  She  then  commanded  the  second  Table  to  be %0a%3c brought  in.  As  soon  as  the  Order  was  given,  the  Attendants %0a%3c placed  before  her  one  only  Vessel  of  Vinegar,2  the  Strength %0a%3c and  Sharpness  of  which  wasted  and  dissolved  the  Pearls. %0a%3c Now  she  wore  at  her  Ears  that  most  remarkable  and  truly %0a%3c singular  Work  of  Nature.  Therefore,  as  Antony  waited  to %0a%3c see  what  she  was  going  to  do,  she  took  one  of  them  from %0a%3c her  Ear,  steeped  it  in  the  Vinegar,  and  when  it  was  liquefied, %0a%3c drank  it.  As  she  was  about  to  do  the  like  by  the  other, %0a%3c L.  Plancius,  the  Judge  of  that  Wager,  laid  hold  upon  it %0a%3c with  his  Hand,  and  pronounced  that  Antony  had  lost  the %0a%3c Wager :  whereat  the  Man  became  very  angry.  The  Fame %0a%3c of  this  Pearl  may  go  with  its  Fellow  ;  for  after  this  Queen, %0a%3c the  Winner  of  so  great  a  Wager,  was  taken  Prisoner,  the %0a%3c other  Pearl  was  cut  in  two,  that  the  half  of  their  Supper %0a%3c might  hang  at  the  Ears  of  Venus,  in  the  Pantheon,  at %0a%3c Rome.  Still,  however,  these  shall  not  bear  away  the  Palm  in %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  Sixty  millions. %0a%3c %0a%3c 2  Cleopatra  must  have  employed  a  stronger  vinegar  than  that  which %0a%3c we  now  use  for  our  tables,  as  the  pearls,  on  account  of  their  hardness  and %0a%3c their  natural  enamel,  cannot  be  easily  dissolved  by  a  weak  acid.   Nature  has %0a%3c secured  the  teeth  of  animals  against  the  effect  of  acids,  by  an  enamel %0a%3c covering  of  the  like  kind  ;  but  if  this  enamel  happen  to  be  injured  only %0a%3c in  one  small  place,  the  teeth  soon  spoil  and  rot.     Cleopatra,  perhaps, %0a%3c broke  and  pounded  the  pearls ;  and  it  is  probable  that  she  afterwards %0a%3c diluted  the  vinegar  with  water,  that  she   might  be  able  to  drink  it ; %0a%3c though  it  is  the  nature  of  the  basis  or  calx  to  neutralise  the  acid,  and  so %0a%3c render  it  imperceptible  to  the  tongue. — See  BECKMAN'S  Hist,  of  Inventions, %0a%3c vol.  ii.  p.  1. %0a%3c %0a%3c The  pearl  which  Cleopatra  swallowed  is  said  to  have  been  worth %0a%3c 80,729*.  3s.  4d.  —  Wern.

For %0a%3c before  this,  Ctodius,  the  Son  of  JEsop?  the  Tragedian,  being %0a%3c left  by  him  Heir  to  very  great  Wealth,  practised  the  same %0a%3c with  Pearls  of  great  Price ;  so  that  Antony  needed  not  to  be %0a%3c over-proud  of  his  Triumvirate,  being  almost  equalled  by  a %0a%3c Stage-player ;  and  that,  too,  when  he  was  not  urged  to  it  by %0a%3c a  Wager,  which  was  much  more  like  a  King.  His  Experi- %0a%3c ment was  the  Glory  of  the  Palate,  for  he  wanted  to  try %0a%3c what  Taste  Pearls  had ;  and  as  they  pleased  him  wonder- %0a%3c fully, because  he  would  not  be  the  only  one  who  knew  the %0a%3c Taste,  he  gave  to  every  Guest  at  his  Table  a  Pearl  to  sup  up %0a%3c in  like  Mariner. %0a%3c %0a%3c Fenestdla  writeth,  that  after  Alexandria  was  reduced  to %0a%3c Subjection,  Pearls  came  into  frequent  and  indiscriminate  use %0a%3c at  Rome ;  but  that  about  the  Time  of  Sylla  they  began  first; %0a%3c and  those  were  but  small  ones,  and  mean.  But  this  is  a  great %0a%3c Error.  For  JElius  Stilo  reporteth,  that  in  the  Time  of  the %0a%3c War  with  Jugurtha,  the  great  Pearls,  for  the  most  Part,  had %0a%3c the  Name  of  Uniones  imposed  on  them. %0a%3c %0a%3c And  this  is  almost  a  perpetual  Possession  :  it  fulloweth %0a%3c the  Heir.

[BooK  IX. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  XXXVI. %0a%3c The  Nature  of  the  Purpura*  and  the  Murex. %0a%3c %0a%3c PURPURJE,  for  the  most  Part,  live  seven  Years.  They %0a%3c lie  hid  for  thirty  Days  about  the  rising  of  the  Dog  Star,  like %0a%3c the  Murices.  They  collect  together  in  the  Spring,  and  with %0a%3c rubbing  one  against  another  they  spit  a  clammy  Substance, %0a%3c in  the  Manner  of  Wax.  The  Murices  do  the  like.  But  that %0a%3c Bloom  which  is  so  much  in  request  for  dyeing  Garments  the %0a%3c Purpurse  have  in  the  midst  of  their  Throat.  Here  is  placed %0a%3c a  white  Vein,  containing  a  very  little  Fluid ;  from  whence %0a%3c is  derived  that  precious  and  bright  Colour  of  deep  red %0a%3c (Nigrantis)  Roses.  The  Rest  of  the  Body  yieldeth  Nothing. %0a%3c Fishermen  endeavour  to  take  them  alive,  for  when  they  die %0a%3c they  cast  up  that  Juice  with  their  Life.  Now  the  Tyrians, %0a%3c when  they  obtain  any  great  Purpurse,  remove  the  Shell  from %0a%3c the  Flesh  ;  but  the  lesser,  they  break  in  a  Mill,  and  so  at %0a%3c last  collect  that  Humour.  This  is  the  best  in  Asia  ;  but  in %0a%3c Africa,  that  in  the  (Island)  Meninx,  and  the  Coast  of  the %0a%3c Ocean  by  Getulia  ;  and  in  Europe,  that  o^f  Laconica.  It  is %0a%3c for  this  the  Roman  Fasces  and  Axes  make  Way  ;  this  is  it %0a%3c that  stands  for  the  Majesty  of  the  Childhood;  this  maketh %0a%3c the  Distinction  between  the  Senate  and  a  Knight ;  this  is %0a%3c summoned  when  they  offer  Sacrifice  to  pacify  the  Gods :  this %0a%3c giveth  a  Lustre  to  every  Garment ;  and  in  their  triumphal %0a%3c Procession  it  is  interlaced  with  the  Gold.  It  is  thus  that  the %0a%3c Madness  after  the  Purpurse  is  to  be  excused.  But  how %0a%3c should  the  Conchylia  be  so  highly  prized?  What  strong %0a%3c Smell  in  the  rank  Colour,  so  harsh  a  Colour  in  the  blue, %0a%3c and  resembling  rather  the  angry  Sea?  But  to  come  to  the %0a%3c particular  Description.  The  Purpura  hath  a  Tongue  the %0a%3c length  of  a  Finger,  so  sharp  and  hard  at  the  End  that  it %0a%3c pierces  into  other  Shell-fishes,  and  feeds  on  them.  In  fresh %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  This  name  included  more  than  one  species ;  but  more  particularly  it %0a%3c is  the  Murex  trunculus,  Guv.

All  Shell-fish  grow  very %0a%3c rapidly,  but  Purpurse  remarkably  so ;  for  in  one  Year  they %0a%3c come  to  their  full  Size.  Now  if  I  should  proceed  no  further, %0a%3c Luxury  would  think  itself  defrauded,  and  condemn  me  for %0a%3c Negligence.  Therefore  we  will  follow  the  Subject  into  the %0a%3c Shops,  that  as  every  Man  for  the  Necessity  of  this  Life %0a%3c knoweth  the  Price  of  Victuals,  all  who  take  Pleasure  in %0a%3c these  Things  may  be  well  versed  in  the  Costs  of  this  their %0a%3c Existence.  These  Shell-fishes  that  serve  for  purple  Colours, %0a%3c and  the  Conchylia,  all  consist  of  one  Material :  the  Differ- %0a%3c ence is  only  in  the  mixing.  They  are  of  two  principal  Sorts. %0a%3c The  Buccinum  is  a  smaller  Shell,  resembling  that  Horn  with %0a%3c which  Sound  is  uttered  ;  and  from  this  it  took  its  Name. %0a%3c The  round  Orifice  is  cut  in  at  the  Edges.  The  other  is %0a%3c named  Purpura,  protrudes  a  long  Snout  like  a  Channel,  and %0a%3c within  the  Side  of  this  Channel  it  is  tubulated,  to  allow  a %0a%3c Passage  for  the  Tongue.  Besides  this  the  Shell  is  studded  as %0a%3c far  as  to  the  Wreathe  with  sharp  Spines,  in  about  seven %0a%3c Rows,  placed  in  a  Circle;  which  the  Buccinum  doth  not %0a%3c possess.  But  so  many  Circles  as  each  of  them  has,  so %0a%3c many  Years  old  they  are.  The  Buccinum  fastens  to  Nothing %0a%3c besides  Rocks,  and  therefore  is  gathered  about  rough %0a%3c Places. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  XXXVII. %0a%3c How  many  Sorts  there  are. %0a%3c %0a%3c PuRPUR2E  have  another  Name,  and  are  called  Pelagiae. %0a%3c There  are  many  Sorts  of  them,  which  differ  either  in  their %0a%3c Situation  or  Food.  The  first  is  the  Lutense,  nourished  by %0a%3c rotten  Mud  :  the  Algense,  the  worst  of  all,  feeding  upon  Sea- %0a%3c weeds close  to  the  Shore ;  and  the  Taeniens^,  which  is  better %0a%3c than  either  of  the  former,  and  is  gathered  about  the  Borders %0a%3c of  the  Sea  called  Tenci.  And  yet  this  Kind  yieideth  only  a %0a%3c light  and  diluted  Colour.  There  are  also  some  termed  Cal- %0a%3c culosae,  from  the  Sea-gravel,  which  is  wonderfully  good  for %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 160  History  of  Nature.  [BooK  IX. %0a%3c %0a%3c Conchylia.  And  by  far  the  best,  the  Purpurae  dialutense, %0a%3c that  is,  a  Kind  which  is  fed  by  various  Kinds  of  Soil.  Now %0a%3c these  Purpurae  are  taken  with  very  small  Snares,  like  Nets, %0a%3c thrown  into  deep  Water.  Within  these,  for  a  Bait,  are  some %0a%3c Shells,  that  will  shut,  and  are  ready  to  snap,  as  we  may %0a%3c see  the  Mituli.  These,  when  half  dead,  are  put  back  into %0a%3c the  Sea,  when  reviving  and  gaping  for  Water,  the  Purpurae %0a%3c eagerly  seek  for  them  with  their  pointed  Tongues,  which %0a%3c they  thrust  out  and  so  annoy  them  :  but  the  others,  feeling %0a%3c themselves  pricked,  presently  shut  their  Shells  together,  and %0a%3c compress  those  that  bite  them.  Thus  the  Purpurae,  through %0a%3c their  Greediness,  are  taken,  hanging  by  their  Tongues. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  XXXVIII. %0a%3c The  Fishing -time  for  Pur  puree. %0a%3c %0a%3c THE  best  Time  to  take  Purpurae  is  after  the  Dog-Star  is %0a%3c risen,  or  before  the  Spring.  For,  when  they  have  borne %0a%3c Young  their  Juice  is  waterish.  But  the  Shops  of  the %0a%3c Dyers  do  not  know  this,  although  their  highest  Skill  turns %0a%3c on  this  Point.  When  they  are  caught  they  extract  the %0a%3c Vein  before-mentioned  ;  and  they  lay  it  in  the  necessary %0a%3c Salt,  in  the  Proportion  of  a  Pint  and  half  (of  Salt)  to  every %0a%3c Hundred-weight.  It  is  right  to  soak  it  for  about  three  Days, %0a%3c for  the  newer  the  Colour  is,  so  much  is  it  stronger.  They %0a%3c heat  it  in  Lead,  and  to  every  Amphora  of  Water1  they  put %0a%3c one  hundred  and  fifty  Pounds  of  the  Colour  so  prepared. %0a%3c They  boil  it  with  a  gentle  Fire,  and  therefore  the  Pipe  must %0a%3c lead  a  good  WTay  off  from  the  Furnace.  During  this  Time,  the %0a%3c Flesh  being  now  and  then  skimmed  off  (for  some  of  this  can- %0a%3c not be  prevented  from  sticking  to  the  Veins),  for  the  most %0a%3c Part  about  the  tenth  Day  the  Kettle  is  sufficiently  pre- %0a%3c pared ;  and  to  make  Trial  of  it,  they  dip  into  it  a  Fleece  of %0a%3c Wool  that  has  been  washed  out  of  one  Water  into  another  : %0a%3c and  until  their  Wish  is  satisfied,  they  persist  in  trying  the %0a%3c Liquor.  The  red  Colour  is  worse  than  that  which  is  dark. %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  See  Chap,  xxxix.  —  Wern.  Club. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BOOK  IX.]  History  of  Nature.  161 %0a%3c %0a%3c The  Wool  absorbs  the  Colour  in  five  Hours :  then  they  card %0a%3c it,  and  put  it  in  again,  until  it  hath  drunk  up  all  the  colour- %0a%3c ing Matter.  The  Buccinum  maketh  no  good  Colour  of  itself; %0a%3c for  it  loses  the  Dye  again.  And,  therefore,  usually  they  join %0a%3c to  it  the  Pelagium  ;  which,  to  its  too  great  Blackness,  giveth %0a%3c that  Depth  and  Brightness  which  is  sought  for  in  Cloth  dyed %0a%3c in  Grain.  Thus  by  mixing  the  Force  of  both  they  raise  one %0a%3c another,  or  bind  each  other  more  closely.  The  amount  of %0a%3c the  Preparation  to  each  Pound  of  Wool  is  two  hundred  of %0a%3c the  Buccinum  to  a  hundred  and  eleven  Pelagian  Purpurse. %0a%3c In  this  Manner  is  made  that  rich  Amethyst  Colour.  But  the %0a%3c Tyrians  thoroughly  dye  the  Wool  in  the  Furnace  of  the %0a%3c Pelagian  Purpurae  only,  while  not  yet  thoroughly  prepared, %0a%3c but  still  green  ;  and  afterwards  they  change  it  into  another, %0a%3c where  the  Buccinum  has  been  boiled.  It  is  most  highly %0a%3c commended  when  it  is  as  deep  a  red  as  congealed  Blood ; %0a%3c blackish  at  the  first  Sight,  but  when  viewed  between  you %0a%3c and  the  Light,  it  shows  a  shining  Lustre.  And  hereupon  it %0a%3c is  that  Homer  calleth  Blood  Purple. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  XXXIX. %0a%3c When  they  began  at  Rome  to  wear  Purple. %0a%3c %0a%3c I  SEE  that  Purple  hath  been  always  used  in  Rome  ;  but %0a%3c Romulus  wore  it  in  his  royal  Robe  (only).  It  is  well  known %0a%3c that  Tullus  Hostilius  was  the  first  of  the  Kings  who,  after  he %0a%3c had  subdued  the  Hetruscans,  put  on  the  Toga  Pretexta  and %0a%3c the  Latus  Clavus.  JVepos  Cornelius,  who  died  under  the %0a%3c Reign  of  Divus  Augustus,  says:  When  I  was  a  young  Man, %0a%3c the  Violet  Purple  was  in  great  Request,  and  a  Pound  of  it %0a%3c was  sold  for  a  hundred  Denarii  i1  and  not  long  after  the %0a%3c Tarentine  red  Purple.  After  this  came  the  double-dyed %0a%3c Tyrian  Purple,  which  could  not  be  bought  for  a  thousand %0a%3c Pounds  of  Denarii.2  P.

This  Purple  was  then  called  Dibapha,  which %0a%3c was  twice  dyed  ;  as  being  of  magnificent  Expense ;  whereas %0a%3c now  almost  all  the  genteel  Purple  Cloths  are  thus  dyed.  In %0a%3c the  Cloths  dyed  with  the  Conchylia  the  other  Things  are %0a%3c the  same,  except  that  there  is  no  Buccinum.  Moreover,  the %0a%3c Broth  is  tempered  with  Water  instead  of  the  Excrement  of %0a%3c a  Man's  Drink;  and  only  a  half  of  the  Preparations  is %0a%3c added.  And  thus  is  made  that  pale  Tint  so  highly  com- %0a%3c mended, as  being  deprived  of  the  full  Colour ;  and  it  is  so %0a%3c much  the  more  diluted,  as  the  Wool  has  been  suffered  to %0a%3c drink  it  up. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  XL. %0a%3c The  Prices  of  these  Cloths. %0a%3c %0a%3c THE  Prices  are  lower,  according  to  the  Abundance  of  the %0a%3c dyeing  Material  found  on  the  Coast.  But  it  was  never  known %0a%3c in  any  Place  that  a  Pound  of  the  Pelagian  (Colour)  has  ex- %0a%3c ceeded five  hundred  Sesterces  : t  nor  a  Pound  of  the  Buc- %0a%3c cinum (Purple)  cost  above  one  hundred  :  which  they  who %0a%3c sell  these  Things  raise  to  an  extravagant  Price.  But  this  is %0a%3c far  from  being  the  End  ;  and  Men  have  a  Delight  to  trifle %0a%3c with  the  Expense :  to  deceive  by  mixing  over  again,  and  so %0a%3c double  the  Produce,  adulterating  even  the  Adulterations  of %0a%3c Nature;  as  to  stain  the  Tortoise,  to  mix  Silver  with  the  Gold, %0a%3c and  so  form  Electrum  :  and  by  adding  Brass  to  these,  to %0a%3c make  the  Corinthian  Metal. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  XLI. %0a%3c %0a%3c The  Manner  of  Dyeing  the  Amethystine  Colour,  Scarlet,  and %0a%3c colour  Hysginum. %0a%3c %0a%3c IT  is  not  enough  to  have  robbed  the  precious  Stone  Ame- %0a%3c thyst of  its  Name,  but  when  they  had  it  perfect,  they  must %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  3  lib.  18  shil.

Also, %0a%3c after  they  have  accomplished  the  (Colour)  Conchylium,  they %0a%3c think  it  better  prepared  to  pass  into  the  Tyrian.  It  should %0a%3c seem  that  these  double  Dyes  came  first  from  the  after- %0a%3c thought of  the  Workman,  when  he  employed  his  Skill  to %0a%3c change  what  he  had  done  and  disliked.  And  from  this  is %0a%3c come  a  Consideration,  and  a  Desire  is  derived  from  a  Fault %0a%3c by  those  portentous  Contrivances ;  and  the  twofold  Way  of %0a%3c Luxury  is  displayed,  by  laying  one  Colour  upon  another, %0a%3c with  great  Labour,  so  as  to  render  it  what  is  called  more %0a%3c pleasant  and  delicate.  Nay,  they  also  mix  the  Dye  of  Land- %0a%3c colours  ;  for  what  is  already  dyed  with  the  Coccus,  they  dye %0a%3c again  in  the  Tyrian  Purple,  to  make  the  Hysginum. %0a%3c %0a%3c The  Coccus  is  a  red  Grain  that  cometh  from  Galatia,  as %0a%3c we  shall  show  in  our  Account  of  (Plants)  of  the  Land  ;  or %0a%3c else  about  Emerita,  in  Lusitania  (Portugal),  and  that,  of  all %0a%3c other,  is  most  esteemed.  But  to  sum  up  in  one  Word  these %0a%3c noble  Colours,  note  this,  that  when  this  Grain  is  one  Year %0a%3c old,  it  maketh  but  a  weak  Tincture ;  but  after  four  Years, %0a%3c the  Strength  of  it  is  gone.  So  that,  neither  young  nor  old,  is %0a%3c it  of  any  great  Strength.  Thus  I  have  sufficiently  treated  of %0a%3c those  Means  which  both  Men  and  Women  think  best  fitted %0a%3c to  set  themselves  out  in  the  best  Manner. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  XLII. %0a%3c %0a%3c Of  the  Pinna,  and  the  Pinnoter :  and  the  Perception  of %0a%3c Fishes. %0a%3c %0a%3c THE  Pinna2  is  also  of  the  Class  of  Shell-fishes.

The  Pinna  gapes  abroad,  and  showeth  to  the  rittle %0a%3c Fishes  her  Body  within,  which  has  no  power  of  seeing.  They %0a%3c make  a  close  Attack  on  it;  and  as  their  Boldness  increases %0a%3c with  their  Impunity,  they  enter  and  fill  the  Shell.  The  Sen- %0a%3c tinel discerns  this  Opportunity,  and  giveth  Token  of  it  by  a %0a%3c gentle  Pinch.  She  shuts  her  Mouth,  and  crusheth  whatever %0a%3c is  within ;  and  then  she  delivers  its  proper  Share  to  her %0a%3c Companion.1  This  Fact  causes  me  to  be  so  much  the  more %0a%3c surprised,  that  there  are  some  who  are  of  Opinion  that %0a%3c Creatures  of  the  Water  have  no  Understanding.  The  Tor- %0a%3c pedo knoweth  her  own  Power,  while  she  herself  is  not  be- %0a%3c numbed. She  lieth  covered  over  and  hidden  in  the  Mud, %0a%3c ready  to  catch  those  Fishes  which,  as  they  unsuspiciously %0a%3c swim  over  her,  she  strikes  with  Numbness.  There  is  no %0a%3c Meat  that  in  Tenderness  is  to  be  preferred  to  the  Liver  of %0a%3c this  Fish.  Nor  is  the  Craftiness  of  the  Rana  less  than  this  ; %0a%3c which  is  the  same  that  is  called  the  Fisher  in  the  Sea.  She %0a%3c lifts  up  the  Horns  which  stand  erect  a  little  before  the  Eyes, %0a%3c so  as  to  project  above  the  Mud  which  she  hath  stirred  up  ; %0a%3c and  so  attracts  the  little  Fishes  which  gather  about  her, %0a%3c until  they  come  so  near  as  to  enable  her  to  seize  them.  In  a %0a%3c similar  Manner  the  Squatina  and  Rhombus  lie  concealed, %0a%3c and  stretch  out  their  Fins,  which  they  move  about,  as  if  they %0a%3c were  some  little  Worms;  and  the  Fish  called  Raia  does  the %0a%3c same.  For  the  Pastinaca  lieth  in  wait  like  a  Thief  in  a %0a%3c Corner,  ready  to  pierce  the  Fishes  that  pass  by  with  a  sharp %0a%3c Spine,  which  is  his  Dart.  It  is  a  Proof  of  the  Craftiness  of %0a%3c this  Fish,  that  whilst  they  are  the  most  sluggish  of  Fishes, %0a%3c they  are  found  to  have  in  their  Belly  the  Mugil,  which  is %0a%3c the  swiftest  of  all  Fishes. %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  "  The  pinna  and  the  crab  together  dwell, %0a%3c For  mutual  succour,  in  one  common  shell. %0a%3c They  both  to  gain  a  livelihood  combine  ; %0a%3c That  takes  the  prey,  when  this  has  given  the  sign. %0a%3c From  hence  this  crab,  above  his  comrade  fam'd, %0a%3c By  ancient  Greeks  was  pinnatores  nam'd." %0a%3c %0a%3c OPPIAN  :  Halicut,  lib.ii.  1. 186,  et  seq.— Wern.

Wlien  this  Creature  hath  swallowed  an %0a%3c Hook,  it  vomits  up  its  Entrails,  until  it  hath  delivered  itself %0a%3c of  the  Hook,  and  then  it  suppeth  them  in  again.  But  the %0a%3c Vulpes  marinse,2  in  the  like  Danger,  swallow  down  more %0a%3c and  more  of  the  Line,  until  it  conies  to  the  weakest  Part, %0a%3c which  it  can  easily  gnaw  asunder.  The  Fish  called  Glanis %0a%3c is  more  cautious ;  it  bites  the  Back  of  the  Hook,  and  does %0a%3c not  devour  the  Bait,  but  nibbles  it  away. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  XLIV. %0a%3c Of  the  Fish  called  Aries. %0a%3c %0a%3c THE  Ram3  attacks  like  a  Robber ;  for  sometimes  it  hides %0a%3c itself  under  the  Shade  of  large  Ships  in  the  salt  Sea, %0a%3c where  it  waiteth  for  any  Man  whom  the  Pleasure  of  Swim- %0a%3c ming may  invite  within  its  Reach ;  at  other  Times  it %0a%3c lifteth  its  Head  above  Water,  to  spy  any  small  Fishing- %0a%3c boats,  arid  then  it  slily  swimmeth  close  to  them,  and %0a%3c sinketh  them. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  XLV. %0a%3c %0a%3c Of  those  that  have  a  third  Nature,  and  are  neither  Animals %0a%3c nor  Plants :  also  of  Urticce  and  Sponges. %0a%3c %0a%3c I  TRULY  am  of  Opinion,  that  those  which  are  neither %0a%3c Animals  nor  Plants,  but  possess  a  third  Nature,  or  are  com- %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  The  creatures  referred  to  appear  to  be  Holothuriae,  and  chiefly  of %0a%3c the  class  Cucumariae ;  which,  when  near  death,  eject  their  entrails,  but %0a%3c without  the  power  of  re -absorbing  them.

[Boox  IX. %0a%3c %0a%3c pounded  of  both  (I  mean  Urticae1  and  Sponges2),  have  yet  a %0a%3c Kind  of  Sense  in  them.  Urticae  wander  about  by  Night,  and %0a%3c likewise  by  Night  change  their  (Colour).  Their  Nature  is %0a%3c formed  of  fleshy  Leafage,  and  on  Flesh  they  feed.  Their %0a%3c Quality  is  to  raise  an  itching  Smart,  like  the  Land  Nettle. %0a%3c Its  Manner  is  to  gather  in  its  Body  exceedingly  close  and %0a%3c stiff;  and  when  a  little  Fish  swimmeth  before  it,  it %0a%3c spreadeth  abroad  its  Branches,  and  thus  claspeth  and  de- %0a%3c voureth  it.  At  other  Times,  as  if  it  were  withered,  suffering %0a%3c itself  to  be  tossed  to  and  fro  among  the  Weeds,  with  the %0a%3c Waves  of  the  Sea,  if  any  Fishes  come  in  contact  with  it, %0a%3c it  seizes  them,  as  they  scratch  the  Itching  they  feel  by  rub- %0a%3c bing themselves  against  the  Rocks.  By  Night  it  seeks  for %0a%3c Pectens  and  Echini.  When  it  feeleth  one's  Hand  to  touch %0a%3c it,  it  changeth  Colour,  and  contracteth  itself.  When  touched, %0a%3c it  discharges  something  that  causes  an  Itching ;  and  if  a %0a%3c little  Interval  is  permitted  after  it  is  touched,  it  becomes %0a%3c concealed.  It  is  thought  that  its  Mouth  lieth  in  the  Root, %0a%3c and  that  it  voideth  its  Excrements  through  a  small  Pipe %0a%3c above. %0a%3c %0a%3c Of  Sponges  we  find  three  Sorts:  the  first  thick,  exceeding %0a%3c hard,  and  rough ;  and  this  is  called  Tragos :  a  second,  not  so %0a%3c thick,  arid  somewhat  softer;  and  that  is  named  Manon  :  the %0a%3c third  is  fine  and  compact,  wherewith  they  make  Rubbers  (to %0a%3c cleanse  with),  and  this  is  termed  Achilleum.  They  grow  all %0a%3c upon  Rocks,  and  are  fed  with  Shell-fish,  Fish,  and  Mud. %0a%3c That  they  possess  Understanding  appeareth  from  this,  that %0a%3c when  they  feel  that  one  would  pluck  them  away,  they  draw %0a%3c in,  so  as  with  the  greater  Difficulty  to  be  pulled  from  the %0a%3c Rock.  They  do  the  like  when  they  are  beaten  with  the %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  Actineae,  a  class  of  naked  Zoophytes.     Macrobius,  in  his  account  of %0a%3c the  supper  given  by  Lentulus,  on  the  occasion  of  his  being  inaugurated %0a%3c Flamen  martialis,  enumerates  Urtica?  among  the  dishes.  —  Wern.

Others  contend  that  they  are  vegetable  ;  and %0a%3c their  natural  station  seems  to  be  on  that  debateable  line  where  each  of %0a%3c these  great  kingdoms  verges  on  the  other  :  some  really  animal  structures %0a%3c appearing  disguised  in  vegetable  forms,  —  and  vegetables  with   animal %0a%3c appearances.  —  Wern.

That  they  live  upon  some  Food  is  manifest  by  the %0a%3c little  Shell-fishes  which  are  found  within  them.  And  some %0a%3c say,  that  about  Torone  they  take  Food  after  they  have  been %0a%3c plucked  from  the  Rocks ;  and  that  from  the  Roots  which %0a%3c are  left  behind,  they  grow  again.  Also,  upon  those  Rocks %0a%3c (from  whence  they  are  pulled),  there  is  to  be  seen  some %0a%3c Appearance  of  Blood  sticking ;  and  especially  in  those  of %0a%3c Africa,  which  breed  among  the  Syrtes.  The  Manse  become %0a%3c very  large,  and  also  the  softest,  about  Lycia.  But  they  are %0a%3c more  soft  when  they  grow  in  the  very  deep  Water,  out  of  the %0a%3c Influence  of  Wind.  They  are  rough  in  the  Hellespont;  and %0a%3c dense  about  (the  Cape)  Malea.  In  Places  exposed  to  the %0a%3c Sun  they  will  putrify ;  and  therefore  the  best  are  in  deep %0a%3c Gullies.  They  are  of  the  same  blackish  Colour  when  they %0a%3c live,  as  when  full  of  Moisture.  They  adhere  to  Rocks  nei- %0a%3c ther by  any  one  Part,  nor  yet  all  over ;  for  there  are  dispersed %0a%3c certain  hollow  Pipes,  four  or  five  commonly,  by  which  they %0a%3c are  supposed  to  receive  their  Food.  There  are  more  (of  these %0a%3c Pipes),  but  above  they  are  grown  together.  A  certain  thin %0a%3c Skin  may  be  perceived  to  be  at  their  Roots.  It  is  known %0a%3c that  they  live  long.  The  worst  Kind  of  them  all  are  those %0a%3c called  Aplysiae,  because  they  cannot  be  made  clean ;  in  them %0a%3c the  Pipes  are  large ;  and  they  are  throughout  thick  and %0a%3c massy. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  XLVI. %0a%3c Of  the  Caniculus  marinus.1 %0a%3c %0a%3c THE  Divers  are  annoyed  very  much  with  a  great  Number %0a%3c of  Caniculi  marini  that  come  about  them,  and  put  them  in %0a%3c great  Danger.  And  they  say,  that  these  Fishes  have  a  cer- %0a%3c tain Cloud  growing  thick  over  their  Heads,  like  that  of  the %0a%3c flat  Fishes,  which  presseth  them,  and  hindereth  them  from %0a%3c retiring  backward  ;  on  which  Account  the  Divers  have  with %0a%3c them  sharp-pointed  Weapons  fastened  to  long  Poles ;  for %0a%3c unless  they  be  pricked  with  them,  they  will  not  turn  away  : %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  The  smaller  kind  of  Sharks,  and,  perhaps,  particularly  the  Ground- %0a%3c sharks,  Scymnium.  —  Wern.

For  I  never  heard  of  any  Man  that  found  the %0a%3c like  Cloud  or  Mist  (for  this  Term  they  give  to  this  Mischief) %0a%3c in  the  Range  of  living  Creatures.  But  the  Contest  with %0a%3c Caniculi  is  furious,  for  they  snap  at  their  Groins,  their  Heels, %0a%3c and  every  Part  of  their  Bodies  that  is  white.  The  only  safe %0a%3c Way  is  to  oppose  them  in  front,  and  so  to  terrify  them  ;  for %0a%3c they  are  as  much  afraid  of  a  Man  as  he  is  of  them.  Thus %0a%3c within  the  Deep  the  Chance  is  equal  ;  but  when  the  Divers %0a%3c mount  to  the  Surface  of  the  Water,  there  the  Danger  is %0a%3c double,  because  while  he  laboureth  to  get  out  of  the %0a%3c Water,  he  faileth  of  Means  to  encounter  the  Creature  pro- %0a%3c ceeding in  an  opposite  Direction ;  therefore  his  only  recourse %0a%3c is  to  his  Comrades :  for,  having  a  Cord  bound  about  his %0a%3c Shoulders,  by  which  they  draw  him  up,  he  shaketh  it  with %0a%3c his  left  Hand  to  give  a  Sign  of  his  Danger,  whilst  he  main- %0a%3c taineth  a  Fight  with  the  right,  by  holding  with  it  the  sharp- %0a%3c pointed  Spear;  but  otherwise  they  haul  him  up  softly.  When %0a%3c he  is  come  near  the  Ship,  unless  they  snatch  him  up  very %0a%3c quickly,  they  may  be  sure  to  see  him  devoured  before  their %0a%3c Face  :  and  when  they  are  at  the  point  of  being  plucked  up, %0a%3c they  are  caught  away  out  of  their  Hands,  if  they  do  not %0a%3c themselves  help  them  who  are  drawing  them  up,  by  gather- %0a%3c ing up  their  Bodies  together,  into  the  form  of  a  Ball.  Some, %0a%3c indeed,  thrust  at  these  Fishes  with  Tridents ;  but  it  is  the %0a%3c Craft  of  this  Monster  to  get  under  the  Bottom  of  the  Ship, %0a%3c and  so  maintain  the  Combat  in  safety.  And  therefore  all %0a%3c their  Care  is  employed  to  guard  against  this  Evil. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  XL VI I. %0a%3c %0a%3c Of  those  Fishes  that  are  shut  within  a  flinty  Shell;  also  of %0a%3c those  that  have  no  Sense :  and  of  other  sordid  Creatures. %0a%3c %0a%3c THE  greatest  Security  that  Fishermen  have,  is  to  discover %0a%3c the  flat  Fishes ;  for  they  are  never  in  any  Place  where  hurt- %0a%3c ful Beasts  are ;  which  is  the  Cause  that  Divers  call  those %0a%3c Fishes  sacred. %0a%3c %0a%3c We  must  confess,  that  Fishes  enclosed  in  flinty  Shells,  as %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BOOK  IX.]  History  of  Nature.  169 %0a%3c %0a%3c Oysters,  have  no  Sense.  Many  are  of  the  same  Nature  as %0a%3c Plants,  as  the  Holothuria,1  Pulmones,2  and  Stellae  (Star- %0a%3c fishes) ;  and  thus  there  is  nothing  that  is  not  bred  within  the %0a%3c Sea  ;  as  the  Creatures  which  in  Summer  Time  abound  within %0a%3c our  Inns,  and  vex  us  with  their  active  Leap ;  as  also  that %0a%3c which  lies  close  under  the  Hair  of  our  Heads  :  for  often  the %0a%3c Fishermen  find  a  Number  of  these  Skippers3  settled  thick %0a%3c about  their  Baits  as  they  draw  them  up.  And  these  are %0a%3c thought  to  infest  the  Fishes  in  their  Sleep  by  Night  in  the %0a%3c Sea.

These  voracious  creatures, %0a%3c which  are  different  species   of  the  Linnean  genus  Oniscus,  obtain  an %0a%3c entrance  at  the  mouth,  and  devour  the  internal  substance,  leaving  the %0a%3c skin  and  scales  an  empty  bag,  or  filled  only  by  bones.  — Wern.

But %0a%3c that  this  or  that  Fish  may  be  sick  appeareth  evidently  from %0a%3c the  wasting  we  see  in  them ;  whereas  others  of  the  same  Sort %0a%3c are  taken  exceedingly  fat. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  L. %0a%3c The  wonderful  Manner  of  their  Breeding. %0a%3c %0a%3c IN  what  Manner  they  breed,  the  Inquiry  and  Wonder  of %0a%3c Mankind  will  not  suffer  me  to  put  off  to  another  Oppor- %0a%3c tunity. Fishes  couple  by  the  rubbing  of  their  Bellies  one %0a%3c against  another ;  which  they  perform  with  such  Celerity  as %0a%3c to  deceive  the  Sight.  Dolphins  and  other  Whales  have  no %0a%3c other  Way,  but  they  are  somewhat  slower.  The  Female %0a%3c Fish,  in  the  Time  of  coupling,  followeth  the  Male,  striking %0a%3c his  Belly  with  her  Snout.  In  the  like  Manner,  about %0a%3c Spawning  Time,  the  Males  follow  the  Female,  devouring %0a%3c their  Spawn.

But  in  such  a  Multi- %0a%3c tude of  Eggs  this  living  Power  doth  not  fall  on  all  of %0a%3c them  ;  for  if  it  did,  all  Seas  and  Lakes  would  be  full  of %0a%3c Fishes  :  for  there  is  not  one  of  these  Females  but  conceiveth %0a%3c an  inconceivable  Number. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  LI. %0a%3c %0a%3c More  concerning  the  Generation  of  Fishes,  and  which  of  them %0a%3c produce  Eggs. %0a%3c %0a%3c THE  Eggs  of  Fishes  grow  in  the  Sea,  some  of  them  ex- %0a%3c ceedingly soon,  as  those  of  the  Muraenee :  others  are  some- %0a%3c what later.  Flat  Fishes,1  which  have  no  Tails  and  sharp %0a%3c Prickles,  when  they  couple,  come  over  one  another,  like %0a%3c Tortoises.  The  Polypi  fasten  one  of  their  Strings  to  the  Nose %0a%3c of  the  Female.  The  Sepiae  and  Loligo  with  their  Tongues, %0a%3c clasp  one  another  with  their  Arms,  and  swim  one  contrary %0a%3c to  the  other:  they  also  produce  their  Eggs  from  the  Mouth. %0a%3c But  the  Polypi  couple  with  their  Heads  downwards  to  the %0a%3c Ground.  The  other  soft  Animals  couple,  Back  to  Back,  as %0a%3c Dogs.  This  is  the  Case  with  Locustae,  Squillee,  Cancri,  at  the %0a%3c Mouth.  Frogs  lie  on  one  another :  the  Male  with  the  Fore- %0a%3c feet clasping  the  Arms  of  the  Female,  and  with  the  Hind- %0a%3c feet  the  Haunches.  They  bring  forth  very  small  Bits  of %0a%3c black  Flesh,  which  they  call  Tadpoles,  only  distinguished %0a%3c by  having  Eyes  and  a  Tail.  Soon  after  their  Feet  are %0a%3c framed,  and  their  Tail  is  divided  into  hinder  Parts.  It  is %0a%3c wonderful  that,  after  they  have  lived  six  Months,  they  are %0a%3c dissolved  into  Slime,  no  Man  seeth  how;  and  afterward  with %0a%3c the  Rains  in  the  Spring,  they  are  restored  to  their  former %0a%3c State,  as  they  were  first  shaped,  by  an  unknown  Way  of %0a%3c Proceeding,  although  it  happeneth  in  this  Way  every  Year,. %0a%3c Mussels  and  Pectens  also,  are  produced  of  themselves  by %0a%3c Nature  in  the  Sands  :  those  which  are  of  a  harder  Crust,  as %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  Pleuronectidae.  —  Wern.

They  that  are  covered  with  a  stony %0a%3c Shell,  as  Oysters,  are  bred  from  the  putrified  Mud,  or  out  of %0a%3c the  Froth  that  hath  stood  long  about  Ships,  or  Posts  fixed  in %0a%3c the  Water,  and  especially  if  they  are  formed  of  Holly- wood. %0a%3c It  hath  been  lately  discovered  in  Oyster  Banks,  that  there %0a%3c passeth  from  them  a  fertile  Liquid  resembling  Milk.  Eels2 %0a%3c rub  themselves  against  Stones,  and  those  Scrapings  come  to %0a%3c Life ;  and  they  have  no  other  Generation.  Fishes  of  different %0a%3c Kinds  do  not  mix  their  Breed  with  another,  except  the %0a%3c Squatina  and  the  Raia ;  from  them  there  is  produced  a  Fish %0a%3c which  in  the  Forepart  resembleth  a  Raia,  and  in  Greek  hath %0a%3c a  Name  compounded  of  both.3  Some  Fishes  breed  both  on %0a%3c Land  and  in  the  Sea,  according  to  the  Warmth  of  the %0a%3c Year.  In  the  Spring,  Pectens,  Limaces  (Slugs),  Hirundines %0a%3c (Leeches),  are  produced  ;  but  in  the  corresponding  Time  of %0a%3c Autumn  they  turn  to  nothing.  Among  Fishes  the  Lupus  and %0a%3c Trichias  breed  twice  a  Year,  and  also  all  that  keep  among %0a%3c Rocks.  The  Mulius  thrice,  as  also  the  Chalcis  ;  the  Cypri- %0a%3c nus  six  Times;  the  Scorpense4  and  Sargi  twice,  namely,  in %0a%3c Spring  and  Autumn.

The  Polypi %0a%3c couple  in  Winter,  and  produce  the  Eggs  in  Spring  ;  being %0a%3c curled  like  the  Tendrils  of  a  Vine  ;  and  that  in  such  Plenty, %0a%3c that  when  they  are  killed  they  are  not  able  to  receive  the %0a%3c Multitude  of  Eggs  in  the  Concavities  of  their  Head  which %0a%3c they  bare  when  they 'were  pregnant.  They  hatch  them  in %0a%3c fifty  Days,  but  many  of  them  perish  from  their  great  Num- %0a%3c ber. The  Locustae  and  the  rest  with  thinner  Shells,  lay  Egg %0a%3c over  Egg,  and  so  brood  upon  them.  The  female  Polypus %0a%3c one  while  sitteth  on  her  Eggs,  at  other  Times  shuts  up  the %0a%3c Cavity  (where  she  hath  laid  them),  with  her  Arms  enfolded %0a%3c across,  one  over  another.  The  Sepia  layeth  also  on  the %0a%3c Land  among  the  Reeds,  or  else  where  she  can  find  Seaweeds %0a%3c growing,  and  by  the  fifteenth  Day  it  is  hatched.  The  Loligo %0a%3c layeth  Eggs  in  the  deep  Water,  which  hang  close  together %0a%3c as  those  of  the  Sepiae.  The  Purpurse,  the  Murex,  and  such %0a%3c like,  lay  in  the  Spring.  The  Echini  are  with  Egg  at  the  Full- %0a%3c Moons  in  the  Winter  :  and  the  Cochleae  are  bred  in  the %0a%3c Winter  also.  The  Torpedo  is  found  to  have  fourscore  Young %0a%3c at  once,  and  she  hatcheth  her  soft  Eggs  within  her  Body, %0a%3c shifting  them  from  one  Place  of  the  Womb  to  another,  and %0a%3c then  excludes  them.  In  a  similar  Manner  do  all  they  which %0a%3c are  called  Cartilaginous.  By  which  it  cometh  to  pass,  that %0a%3c Fish  alone  both  conceive  Eggs,  and  bring  forth  a  living- %0a%3c Creature.  The  Male  Silurus,  of  all  others,  keepeth  the  Eggs %0a%3c after  they  are  deposited,  many  Times  for  fifty  Days,  that %0a%3c they  may  not  be  devoured  by  others.  Other  Females  hatch %0a%3c in  three  Days,  if  the  Male  touch  them.

It  is  probable,  therefore,  that  the  Mus  marinus  is  a  small  Sea- %0a%3c turtle  ;  and  the  mice  of  the  Nile  (Ch.

And  since  we %0a%3c mention  Fish-ponds,  we  should  do  well  to  write  a  little  more %0a%3c of  them  before  we  give  over  this  Discourse  of  Creatures  of %0a%3c the  Water. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  LIV. %0a%3c Of  Oyster-beds,  and  who  first  invented  them. %0a%3c %0a%3c THE  first  who  invented  Oyster-beds  was  Sergius  Grata, %0a%3c who  made  them  at  Bajanum,  in  the  Time  of  L.  Crassus  the %0a%3c Orator,  before  the  Marsian  War.  And  this  he  did,  not  for %0a%3c his  Appetite,  but  for  Profit ;  and  by  this  Invention,  and %0a%3c others,  he  gathered  great  Revenues :  for  he  it  was  that  in- %0a%3c vented the  Hanging-baths,  and  so  sold  his  Villa  to  better %0a%3c Advantage.  He  was  the  first  Man  who  pronounced  the %0a%3c Lucrine  Oysters  to  be  of  the  most  excellent  Taste :  for  the %0a%3c same  Kinds  of  Creatures  of  the  Water  in  one  Place  are  better %0a%3c than  in  another :  as  the  Lupus-fish  in  the  River  Tiber,  be- %0a%3c tween the  two  Bridges  :  the  Rhomnus  (Turbot)  at  Ravenna  : %0a%3c the  Mursena  in  Sicily :  the  Elops  at  Rhodes,  and  in  like %0a%3c Manner  of  other  Sorts  of  Fishes ;  for  I  do  not  intend  to  give %0a%3c a  long  Criticism  on  Cookery.  At  this  Time  the  British %0a%3c Shores  were  not  employed  to  prepare  them  when  Grata %0a%3c ennobled  those  of  the  Lucrine  Lake ;  but  afterwards  it  was %0a%3c thought  profitable  to  seek  Oysters  from  Brundusium,  in  the %0a%3c furthest  Part  of  Italy.  And  to  prevent  Controversy  between %0a%3c opposite  Tastes,  it  was  of  late  devised  that  the  Oysters, %0a%3c which  in  the  long  Carriage  from  Brundusium  were  almost %0a%3c famished,  should  be  fed  in  the  Lucrine  Lake.  A  little  before %0a%3c this  same  Time,  Licinius  Murena  invented  Ponds  for  keeping %0a%3c other  Fishes ;  and  his  Example  was  followed  by  Noblemen, %0a%3c as  Philippus  and  Hortensius.  Lucullus  cut  through  a  Moun- %0a%3c tain near  Naples  (for  this  Purpose),  and  let  in  an  Arm  of  the %0a%3c Sea  into  his  Fish-ponds ;  the  Cost  of  which  was  greater  than %0a%3c that  of  the  House  which  he  had  built.  For  this  Reason %0a%3c Pompey  the  Great  gave  him  the  Name  of  Xerxes  Togatus. %0a%3c The  Fishes  of  that  Pond,  after  his  death,  were  sold  for  thirty %0a%3c hundred  thousand  Sesterces  (three  millions  of  Sesterces). %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 176  History  of  Nature.

He  it  was %0a%3c that  lent  Ccesar  the  Dictator,  for  his  triumphal  Suppers,  six %0a%3c hundred  Muraenae  in  Numher,  to  be  paid  again  ;  for  he %0a%3c would  not  sell  them  for  Money,  nor  exchange  them  for  other %0a%3c Merchandise.  Although  his  Villa  was  of  moderate  size,  yet %0a%3c the  Fish-ponds  about  it  sold  the  House  for  four  millions  of %0a%3c Sesterces.  After  this  the  Love  of  some  one  particular  Fish %0a%3c became  general.  The  Orator  Hortensius  had  a  Pond  at %0a%3c Bauli,  upon  the  Side  that  lieth  toward  Baeiae,  in  which  was  a %0a%3c Muraena  for  which  he  felt  such  regard,  that  when  it  was %0a%3c dead  it  is  believed  that  he  wept  for  it.1  At  the  same  Villa, %0a%3c Antonia  the  wife  of  Drusus  affixed  Ear-rings  to  a  Muraena %0a%3c in  which  she  delighted ;  the  Report  of  which  caused  some %0a%3c People  to  wish  to  visit  Bauli. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  LVI. %0a%3c The  Preserves  for  Snails ,2  and  who  first  invented  them. %0a%3c %0a%3c FULVIUS  HIRPINUS  was  the  first  Inventor  of  Store- %0a%3c preserves  for  Snails  within  the  Territory  of  Tarquinii,  a  little %0a%3c before  the  Civil  War  with  Pompey  the  Great.  And  those %0a%3c had  their  distinct  Partitions  for  their  several  Sorts  :  so  that %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  JElian  (B.  viii.  ch.  iv.),  perhaps  from  hearsay,  has  jumbled  these  two %0a%3c incidents  into  one ;  but  he  has  added  a  piece  of  wit,  which  renders  it %0a%3c worth  transcribing.     "  The  Romans  celebrate  the  Muraena  of  Crassus, %0a%3c which  he  adorned  with  ear-rings  and  precious  stones,  as  if  it  had  been  a %0a%3c beautiful  girl.     He  also  taught  the  fish  to  know  his  voice,  and  to  swim  to %0a%3c him  and  take  food  from  his  hand.     I  have  been  informed  that  when  this %0a%3c fish  died  he  wept  for  it,  and  gave  it  an  honourable  funeral.     When  on %0a%3c some  occasion  Domitius  said  to  him  :  *  What  a  fool,  Crassus,  to  weep  for %0a%3c the  death  of  a  Mura?na  1 '    To  which  he  answered :  *  True,  I  wept  the %0a%3c death  of  an  animal ;  but  that  is  more  than  any  one  saw  you  do  at  the %0a%3c funerals  of  your  three  wives.'" — Wern.

Nay, %0a%3c he  had  a  Contrivance  to  feed  them  with  boiled  Wine  and %0a%3c Wheat  Meal,  and  other  similar  Things ;  to  the  End  that %0a%3c Riot  might  be  served  plentifully  with  home-fed  Snails.  And %0a%3c the  Glory  of  this  Art  produced  them  at  last  of  such  Bigness, %0a%3c that  one  of  their  Shells  would  contain  fourscore  (Measures %0a%3c called)  Quadrants,1  according  to  M.  Varro. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  LVII. %0a%3c Of  Land-fishes. %0a%3c %0a%3c THEOPHRASTUS  also  telleth  strange  Wonders  of  some %0a%3c kinds  of  Fishes  :  that  about  Babylon  there  are  Places  subject %0a%3c to  the  Inundations  of  the  Rivers,  and  in  which  the  Water %0a%3c standeth  in  Pits,  and  the  Fish  remain  after  the  Waters %0a%3c are  returned  within  their  Banks  ;  and  that  some  of  these %0a%3c Fishes  quit  those  Retreats  to  seek  for  Food,  walking  with %0a%3c their  Fins,  and  wagging  their  Tails  as  they  go.  And  if  any %0a%3c pursue  them  they  retreat  into  their  Pits,  and  when  in  them, %0a%3c stand  opposed  to  them  :  that  their  Heads  are  like  those  of %0a%3c the  Rana  marina,  but  the  other  Parts  like  the  Gobius  ;  and %0a%3c the  Gills  as  in  other  Fishes.  Also  that  about  Heraclea  and %0a%3c Cromna,  and  the  River  Lycus,  and  in  many  Parts  of  Pontus, %0a%3c there  is  one  Kind  that  haunteth  the  utmost  edges  of  the %0a%3c Rivers,  and  maketh  itself  Holes  in  the  Land,  and  liveth  in %0a%3c them,  even  when  the  Shore  is  dry,  and  the  Rivers  are %0a%3c gathered  into  narrow  Channels.  Therefore  they  are  digged %0a%3c out;  and  that  they  are  alive  appears  finally  by  the  Motion  of %0a%3c their  Bodies.  Near  the  abovesaid  Heraclea  and  the  River %0a%3c Lycus,  when  the  Water  is  ebbed,  there  are  Fishes  bred  from %0a%3c the  Eggs  left  in  the  Mud ;  and  these,  in  seeking  their  Food, %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  Three  wine  gallons  and  three  quarts :  for  a  Quadrans  is  three  Cyathi, %0a%3c i.  e.  the  fourth  part  of  a  Sextarius,  and  a  Sextarius  is  a  wine  pint  and  a  half, %0a%3c or  eighteen  ounces. %0a%3c %0a%3c By  quoting  an  author,  Pliny  sufficiently  testifies  that  he  had  never %0a%3c seen  a  shell  of  a  snail  (Calix)  of  such  size.  — Wern.

He  affirmeth, %0a%3c also,  that  the  Eggs  (of  Fishes)  lying  upon  the  dry  Land, %0a%3c will  come  to  their  Maturity,  as  those  of  the  Tortoises.  Also, %0a%3c that  in  the  same  Country  of  Pontus,  there  are  taken  Fishes %0a%3c in  the  Ice,  and  Gobiones1  especially,  which  do  not  show  a %0a%3c vital  Motion,  but  by  the  Heat  of  the  Cooking- Vessels.  In %0a%3c this  some  Reason  may  be  given,  although  the  Thing  is  won- %0a%3c derful. The  same  Author  reporteth,  that  in  Paphlagonia %0a%3c there  are  digged  out  of  the  Ground  Land-fishes  that  are  very %0a%3c excellent  as  Food  :  but  they  are  found  in  deep  Furrows,  in %0a%3c such  Places  where  no  Waters  settle.  Himself  wondereth %0a%3c how  they  are  produced  without  the  help  of  Moisture.  He %0a%3c supposeth  that  there  is  in  them  a  certain  Force  of  Liquid  in %0a%3c Wells,  as  Fishes  are  found  in  some  of  them.  Whatever  it  is, %0a%3c surely  it  is  less  wonderful,  considering  how  Moles  live  (a %0a%3c Creature  naturally  keeping  under  Ground),  unless,  perhaps, %0a%3c that  these  Fishes  are  of  the  same  Nature  with  Earth-worms. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  LVIII. %0a%3c Of  the  Mice  of  the  Nile. %0a%3c %0a%3c BUT  the  Inundation  of  the  Nile  brings  Credibility  to %0a%3c all  these  Matters  ;  for  it  exceedeth  all  other  Wonders.  For %0a%3c when  the  Ground  becometh  again  uncovered,  little  Mice  are %0a%3c found  imperfectly  formed  from  the  generative  Virtue  of %0a%3c Water  and  Earth  :  having  one  Part  of  their  Body  living, %0a%3c but  the  rest  of  the  Form  no  better  than  the  Earth. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  LIX. %0a%3c Of  the  Fish  Anthias*  and  how  it  is  taken. %0a%3c %0a%3c I  DO  riot  think  it  proper  to  omit  that  which  I  perceive %0a%3c many  have  believed  concerning  the  Fish  Anthias.  We  have %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  Perhaps  some  fish  resembling  the  Gudgeon.  —  Wern.  Club. %0a%3c %0a%3c 2  It  appears  from  Oppian,  B.  i.,  that  four  different  sorts  of  fish  were %0a%3c called  by  this  name.     The  fish  referred  to  by  Pliny  may  be  the  Labrus %0a%3c anthias,  LINN.,  and  Serranus  anthias,  Cuv.  —  Wern.

For  the  Fisherman  goes  in  a  small  Boat  for  cer- %0a%3c tain Days  together,  to  a  certain  Distance  in  the  Sea,  with %0a%3c his  Garments  of  one  Colour,  at  one  Hour,  and  there  he %0a%3c casteth  his  Bait.  But  whatever  is  thrown  from  the  Boat %0a%3c becomes  an  Object  of  Suspicion  to  the  intended  Prey;  and %0a%3c what  it  feareth  it,  guards  against ;  until  at  length,  after  this %0a%3c has  been  often  practised,  one  Anthias,  enticed  by  the  Repe- %0a%3c tition, seizeth  the  Bait.  The  Fisherman  carefully  notes  this %0a%3c one  Fish  as  the  Foundation  of  his  Hope,  and  the  Enticer  of %0a%3c others  that  will  be  caught.  And  that  is  no  hard  Matter  for %0a%3c him  to  do,  because  for  some  Days  that  Fish  alone  dares  to %0a%3c come  to  the  Bait.  At  length  he  meets  with  some  others, %0a%3c and  by  little  and  little  he  is  better  accompanied,  until  in  the %0a%3c End  he  brings  with  him  large  Sculls,  so  that  now  the  oldest %0a%3c of  them  being  so  well  accustomed  to  know  the  Fisherman, %0a%3c they  will  snatch  Meat  out  of  his  Hand.  Then  he  thrusteth %0a%3c forth  an  Hook  with  the  Bait,  somewhat  beyond  his  Fin- %0a%3c gers, and  flieth  upon  them  more  truly  than  catcheth  them, %0a%3c with  a  short  Snatch ;  seizing  them  from  the  Shadow  of  the %0a%3c Ship,  in  such  a  Manner  as  not  to  scare  the  others  away. %0a%3c It  is  important  to  Success  that  he  should  know  the  first %0a%3c Enticer,  that  he  may  not  take  him.  The  Fisherman  spareth %0a%3c him,  that  he  may  fly  to  some  other  Flock.  It  is  reported %0a%3c that  one  contentious  Fisherman,  out  of  Ill-will,  captured  this %0a%3c Captain-fish  which  led  the  rest  into  the  Snare,  for  he  was %0a%3c well  known  :  but  when  the  Fisherman  recognised  him  in  the %0a%3c Market  in  the  Possession  of  a  fellow-Fisherman,  regarding %0a%3c himself  as  wronged,  he  brought  his  Action  for  the  Damage,  so %0a%3c that  the  other  was  condemned.  Mutianus  adds,  that  the  Fine %0a%3c was  ten  Pounds.  The  same  Anthiae,  if  they  see  one  of  their %0a%3c Fellows  caught  with  a  Hook,  are  reported  to  cut  the  Line  with %0a%3c the  serrated  sharp  Spines  which  they  have  upon  their  Back ; %0a%3c and  that  one  which  hangeth  at  it,  stretcheth  it  out  straight, %0a%3c that  it  may  be  cut  asunder  more  easily.  But  the  Sargus,  if %0a%3c he  find  himself  taken,  rubs  the  Line  against  a  Rock. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 180  History  of  Nature.

They  say  it  is  so  fiery  hot,  that  whatever  it  toucheth %0a%3c in  the  Sea  it  burneth  :  and  whatever  Food  it  receiveth,  it %0a%3c immediately  digesteth.  What  Proof  there  is  of  this  I  cannot %0a%3c readily  say.  I  would  think  that  more  worthy  to  be  recorded %0a%3c which  hath  daily  Experience. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  LXI. %0a%3c Of  the  Dactyli-  and  their  wonderful  Properties. %0a%3c %0a%3c THE  Dactyli  are  a  kind  of  Shellfish  ;  and  they  derive %0a%3c their  Name  from  their  Likeness  to  Men's  Nails.  The  Nature %0a%3c of  this  Fish  is  to  shine  in  the  Dark,  when  all  other  Light %0a%3c is  taken  away.  The  more  Moisture  they  have,  the  more %0a%3c Light  they  give  ;  they  shine  in  Men's  Mouths  as  they  chew %0a%3c them:  they  shine  in  their  Hands:  on  the  Floor,  and  on  their %0a%3c Garments,  if  any  Drops  fall  on  them  :  so  that  it  appeareth %0a%3c to  proceed  from  the  very  Nature  of  that  Juice,  which  we  so %0a%3c wonder  at  in  the  Body. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  LXII. %0a%3c Of  the  Enmity  and  Amity  of  Fishes  between  themselves. %0a%3c %0a%3c THERE  are  wonderful  Instances  of  Enmities  and  Agree- %0a%3c ment. The  Mugii  and  Lupus  burn  with  mutual  Hatred  ; %0a%3c likewise  the  Conger  and  Mursena:  so  that  they  gnaw  off  one %0a%3c another's  Tails.  The  Locusta  is  so  afraid  of  the  Polypus, %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  The  various  species  of  Star-fishes :  Asteriadce.  The  ancients  in- %0a%3c dulged the  idea  that  the  sea  contained  a  counterpart  of  every  thing  that %0a%3c was  to  be  found  on  the  land  or  in  the  sky ;  but  to  support  this  opinion, %0a%3c they  were  contented  with  very  loose  analogies,  or  mere  quibbles. — Wern. %0a%3c Club. %0a%3c %0a%3c 3  Pholades,  and  especially  Ph.  dactylus,  LINN.  —  Wern.

Locustae %0a%3c tear  the  Conger  :l  the  Congers  again  do  the  same  to  the %0a%3c Polypus.  Nigidius  writeth,  that  the  Lupus  biteth  off  the %0a%3c Mullet's  Tail :  and  yet  these  Fishes  in  certain  Months  are %0a%3c good  Friends.  But  he  saith  that  those  Fishes  live,  although %0a%3c their  Tails  are  so  gnawed  off.  On  the  other  side,  there  are %0a%3c Examples  of  Friendship  among  Fishes,  besides  those  of %0a%3c whose  Society  I  have  already  written :  as  between  the %0a%3c Balsena,  and  the  Musculus.2  For  whereas  the  (Balaena)  hath %0a%3c no  use  of  his  Eyes,  by  reason  of  the  heavy  Weight  of  his %0a%3c Eyebrows  that  cover  them,  the  other  swimmeth  before  him, %0a%3c and  serveth  him  instead  of  Eyes,  to  show  the  Shallows,  on %0a%3c which  his  vast  Bulk  might  be  grounded. %0a%3c %0a%3c From  this  we  will  proceed  to  speak   of  the  Nature  of %0a%3c Birds. %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  Locustae  congrum,  ex  Arist.  lib.  vii.  cap.  ii.
