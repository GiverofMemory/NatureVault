text=Lost Books of the Bible [[https://archive.org/stream/LostBooksOfTheBible/LostBooksOfTheBible_djvu.txt|#]]%0a%0aAccording to some estimates, early Christians wrote at least twenty %0agospels that weren't included in the bible. Many of these non-biblical %0agospels apparently disappeared later, although it's possible that copies of %0asome of them still survive at unknown locations. Luckily, several that %0aappeared to be missing have been found again in modern times. But some %0aare still missing, and could be permanently lost. %0a%0aGospels that were left out of the Bible are called noncanonical gospels. %0aMany scholars also call them apocryphal books, because most of them %0ahave unknown origins. This uncertainty about their origins was one reason %0amany of them were excluded from the Bible. But some were also excluded %0abecause they expressed unorthodox or heretical views. %0a%0aScholars know about the past existence of some missing gospels %0abecause they are mentioned in other ancient writings that have survived. %0aParts of some lost books were even copied into surviving writings, so that a %0aportion of their original content is still preserved. %0a%0aIn fact, people are often surprised to learn that parts of several lost %0agospels may have been preserved in Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. This %0apreserved material has been identified by certain characteristics which %0aindicate that it was copied from other writings. Thus the authors of the New %0aTestament gospels apparently got some of their information from earlier %0awritings. Modern scholars call these earlier writings "sources", and have %0adetermined that there were probably three of them. But apparently all of %0athem have disappeared. %0a%0aThese three lost sources may have been the first gospels. Their ancient %0anames are unknown, so they are usually identified by modern names, %0aspecifically the Lost Q Source, the Pre- Markan Passion Narrative, and the %0aSigns Gospel. Because no copies of any of them have survived, they are %0asometimes called hypothetical gospels. But most scholars believe that they %0areally did exist at one time. %0a%0aActually, these three missing gospels aren't completely lost, since %0amaterial from them is preserved in Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. In fact, %0aconsiderable knowledge about their original content has been obtained by %0astudying this preserved material. %0a%0aSome other non-biblical gospels have been discovered more directly, %0abecause actual physical remains have been found. Examples include the %0aGospel of Peter, the Gospel of Mary, and the Gospel of Judas. All of these %0awere discovered in modern times. But only fragments or secondary %0atranslations have been found, so the complete original forms of all of them %0aare still unavailable. %0a%0aThese three rediscovered gospels are named after Simon Peter, Mary %0aMagdalene, and Judas Iscariot, but those weren't their real authors. Their %0areal authors are unknown, and will probably never be identified. In ancient %0atimes unknown authors would sometimes ascribe their books to famous %0apeople in an effort to get more publicity and authority for them. %0a%0aAncient writers mentioned a number of other gospels which they knew %0aabout, but which apparently no longer survive. These include the Gospel of %0aMatthias, the Gospel of Perfection, the Gospel of the Seventy, the Dialogue %0aof the Savior, the Gospel of the Twelve, the Book of the Hebrews, the %0aGospel of the Nazarenes, the Gospel of Bartholomew, the Secret Gospel of %0aMark, and the Gospel of Eve. Other gospels may have also existed, but %0aeven their names have been lost. %0a%0aSome early gospels may have vanished because they were secret %0agospels and very few copies were made. Others could have been lost due %0ato wars, conquests, upheavals, and persecutions. In addition, there have %0abeen accusations that early church leaders intentionally destroyed some %0abooks in order to cover up embarrassing facts about the origins of %0aChristianity. Some intentional destruction did take place, but exactly what %0awas lost can't be determined. %0a%0aBut the modern discoveries prove that a missing gospel can sometimes %0a%0a%0a%0abe found again. And there is a chance that more will be found in the future, %0aespecially since small fragments of several possible unknown gospels have %0abeen uncovered in various excavations. %0a%0aHere are brief descriptions of some of the best-known lost (or %0arediscovered) gospels: %0a%0aThe Gospel of Peter %0a%0aA fragment of this gospel was discovered in Egypt in the late nineteenth %0acentury, and two more possible fragments have been found since then. But %0aa large portion may still be missing. Hopefully the remainder will eventually %0abe found, because the available text contains some interesting material, %0aincluding the only known description of Jesus leaving the tomb after his %0aresurrection. %0a%0aEver since the first fragment was discovered, this gospel has been %0acontroversial. A few scholars think that it preserves some of the beliefs and %0aviews of the earliest Christians. But most regard it as a secondary work %0acontaining a mixture of fanciful elements and material copied from the New %0aTestament gospels. %0a%0aOne very intriguing part of this gospel is its account of the exit of Jesus %0afrom the tomb. This exit takes place during the night as some Roman %0asoldiers stand guard nearby. Suddenly the soldiers see two men (or angels) %0adescend from heaven and enter the tomb. A short time later the men come %0aback out with Jesus between them. At this point the men look so tall that %0atheir heads reach to the sky, and Jesus looks even taller. They are followed %0aout of the tomb by a cross. Suddenly the soldiers hear a voice from heaven, %0aand the cross answers it. %0a%0aThe description of this scene puzzles many people, since it appears to %0adepict a wooden cross that can walk and talk. But some scholars think that %0athe passage is actually describing a cross-like formation of resurrected %0asaints who have returned to life along with Jesus and follow him out of the %0atomb. A few scholars also see connections between this account and a %0apassage at Matthew 27:52-53, which describes a similar resurrection of %0adead saints. %0a%0aThe Gospel of Mary %0a%0aThe existence of this gospel was unknown until several fragments were %0adiscovered in modern times. Since the only long fragment is a Coptic %0atranslation, most of the original Greek text is still lost. And even the long %0afragment may only include about half of the gospel. %0a%0aBecause the "Mary" in this gospel is depicted as a very prominent %0adisciple, most scholars assume that she is Mary Magdalene, although in the %0aextant text she is always just called Mary. The gospel emphasizes her %0aprominence by presenting her as a strong leader, and by suggesting that %0ashe was the most favored disciple of Jesus and received a special %0arevelation from him. It also suggests that this led to a conflict with Peter, %0awho may have seen her as a threat to his position as overall leader of the %0adisciples in the period after Jesus departed. %0a%0aIndications of a rivalry with Peter are especially evident in the last section %0aof the extant text, in which Mary gets into an argument with Peter and his %0abrother Andrew over some private revelations that Jesus had given to her. %0aThis section may derive from memories of a historical conflict between her %0aand Peter which eventually caused her to leave the group. Thus, although %0athis gospel probably wasn't written until the second century, it may preserve %0asome traditions passed down from an earlier period. %0a%0aThe Gospel of Mary contains some gnostic ideas, particularly in the %0asection which describes the revelations she received from Jesus. This %0aconnection with gnosticism, together with the prominent role that the book %0agives to a female, may have led to its suppression by orthodox Christians. %0a%0aThe Gospel of Thomas %0a%0aThis gospel was probably first written in Greek, but the only surviving %0acomplete text is a Coptic translation discovered in Egypt in 1945. Its initial %0a%0a%0a%0asection indicates that it contains the "secret sayings" of Jesus, and the main %0atext then gives 114 of these sayings. In most of the passages Jesus speaks %0aas a teacher and his disciples make comments and ask questions. %0a%0aBecause the initial section of this gospel refers to "secret sayings", many %0ascholars believe that it was a secret gospel, at least originally. This means %0athat it was thought to contain secret knowledge, and that only certain %0aindividuals were allowed to read it. Several other secret gospels, or %0afragments of them, have also been discovered. %0a%0aThe Gospel of Thomas may preserve some authentic teachings of Jesus %0athat aren't found in the bible. For this reason, many scholars regard it as the %0amost important surviving non-canonical gospel. %0a%0aThe Gospel of Judas %0a%0aThe only extant copy of this gospel was found in Egypt, but the time and %0aplace of its discovery are uncertain, and there are indications that it passed %0athrough the Egyptian black market at one stage. %0a%0aThe existing copy is a Coptic text, probably a translation of a still-lost %0aGreek original. Unfortunately the manuscript is damaged in many places, %0aand some pages are missing, so that translation and interpretation are %0adifficult. However, many scholars believe that it was a secret book used %0amostly by certain gnostic sects of Christians. %0a%0aThis gospel is notable in that it may depict Judas Iscariot as the most %0aloyal disciple of Jesus, and an innocent martyr instead of an evil betrayer. %0aBut because of the damage to the manuscript, and the difficulties of %0ainterpretation, there is some uncertainty about this matter. In any case, this %0ais one of the later gospels, probably not written until the second century, and %0amost scholars doubt that it contains any authentic information about the real %0aJudas Iscariot. %0a%0aThe Lost Q Source %0a%0aThis early gospel is also called the Lost Sayings Gospel and the Q %0aDocument. Like other hypothetical lost gospels, its probable existence has %0abeen inferred from studies of the New Testament gospels. In fact, it is %0athought to be the original source of many of the teachings of Jesus that are %0apreserved in Matthew and Luke. The name "Q" comes from the German %0aword "quelle", which means "source". %0a%0aMost scholars believe that this gospel was primarily a collection of the %0asayings of Jesus, with little narrative material or biographical information. In %0athe earliest period these sayings must have been preserved orally, but later %0asomeone apparently collected them and wrote them down. They may have %0abeen collected for the use of early Christian missionaries as an aid in %0aspreading the new faith. %0a%0aScholars have put together possible reconstructions of this gospel by %0aextracting material from Matthew and Luke, but some uncertainties are %0ainvolved in exactly what should be included. There is a chance that some of %0athe original parts of this gospel have been completely lost. %0a%0aThe Pre-Markan Passion Narrative %0a%0aScholars have deduced the probable existence of this gospel from careful %0astudies of the Gospel of Mark. These studies indicate that the author of %0aMark obtained some material from an earlier source. This source has been %0alost, but the evidence indicates that it was a short narrative of the arrest, %0ainterrogation, and crucifixion of Jesus. For this reason, it is called the Pre- %0aMarkan Passion Narrative. %0a%0aThe unknown author of this lost narrative had a good knowledge of what %0ahappened to Jesus during and after his arrest. The narrative might have %0aeven been written by a member of the first community of believers, known %0aas the Nazarenes, who lived in Jerusalem in the years after Jesus departed. %0a%0aReconstructions of the original form of this book indicate that it gave a %0asimple straight-forward account of what happened before and during the %0acrucifixion. Because this account may be the basis for all the later accounts, %0awhoever wrote it performed an extremely important service. %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Signs Gospel %0a%0aThe likely existence of this hypothetical gospel has been deduced from %0astudies of the Gospel of John. It is called the Signs Gospel because it %0aapparently described some miracles of Jesus which it called "signs". Its %0aunknown author may have regarded the ability of Jesus to perform these %0amiracles as one of the "signs" that he was the Messiah. %0a%0aThese miracles include the changing of water into wine (John 2:1-11), the %0agiving of sight to the man born blind (John 9:1-8), the healing at the Pool of %0aBethesda (John 5:2-9) and the raising of Lazarus (John 11:1-45). The fact %0athat these particular miracles aren't mentioned in the other gospels indicates %0athat their authors probably hadn't read the Signs Gospel. %0a%0aIn addition to the miracle stories, this gospel may have also contained %0asome information about John the Baptist, and about the crucifixion and %0aresurrection. But it probably didn't have much information about the %0ateachings of Jesus. %0a%0aNOTE %0a%0aThis article was originally published on the Gospel Mysteries website.
