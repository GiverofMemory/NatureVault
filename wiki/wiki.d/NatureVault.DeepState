csum=Fake leaker story, turns out [[FBI]] and [[DOJ]] have access to the classified database.  There would be no way for this 21 yr old reservist to get these documents without them being fed to him by someone else via icemail, thier classified email system since they are SAP or SCI (special access program or sensitive compartmentalized information) on JWICS (joint worldwide intelligence communication system; which is just a secure line, it can be calls, texts, etc but you can't just browse or search for info on)  There is inteleak which is sort of like an intranet and intelipedia which is a general info wiki (no specifics or documents, just what they are seeing and what they think should happen).  Top secret SCI clearance (highest level in military) -&gt; Skiff -&gt; Terminal -&gt; JWICS -&gt; intelipedia -&gt; print. Another strange thing is the deep state has been talking about updating access and limiting information more for years, but it just so happens before? they do it they get a convenient leak in order to further the deep state agenda and then using the publicity to ask for more money to do the updates they had already been planning for years.
