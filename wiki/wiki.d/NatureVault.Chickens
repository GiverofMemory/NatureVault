This is false and can lead to embryo death.  The bloom is water soluble, but it takes a long time to dissolve, a quick rub with a damp cloth will not remove the bloom.

This is false and can lead to embryo death.  The bloom is water soluble, but it takes a long time to dissolve, a quick rub with a damp cloth will not remove the bloom.  In fact a quick rub with a cloth damp with probiotic soaked water is probably the best to prevent the eggs from being contaminated by fecal bacteria from feces on the egg during incubation.%0a

Several of which,%0a> when ingested by humans and animals above a certain concentration, will cause a toxic response%0a> called mycotoxicosis. Mycotoxin-producing molds also damage crops, which can cause significant%0a> economic losses at all levels of food and feed production.%0a> Toxin production requires a) the presence of a mold; b) a suitable substrate; and c) a suitable%0a> environment. If a mold is present, toxin production is influenced by moisture, temperature, oxygen,%0a> and nature of substrate. Most plant feedstuffs will provide a suitable substrate. Molds not only%0a> produce mycotoxins, but also reduce the nutrient value of feed (30).%0a> %0a> MAJOR MYCOTOXINS IN POULTRY%0a> The most significant mycotoxin-related%0a> risks in poultry are associated with fungi%0a> of the genera Aspergillus, Fusarium,%0a> and Penicillium. These fungi and their%0a> mycotoxins are produced either preharvest, during harvest, in storage,%0a> or during feed processing whenever%0a> conditions are favorable. Fusarium%0a> species are field fungi that invade grains%0a> during the growth of the plant, and%0a> Aspergillus and Penicillium species are%0a> storage fungi which generally develop%0a> after harvesting.%0a> Some fungal strains can produce%0a> more than one mycotoxin and a single%0a> mycotoxin can be produced by more%0a> than one fungus, meaning birds are%0a> generally exposed to not just one%0a> mycotoxin but to several toxins at%0a> the same time.

The toxin occurs in%0a> warm and humid climatic conditions and is not considered a problem in colder climates; however,%0a> the global availability of feed stuffs means contaminated materials can be transported anywhere in%0a> the world.%0a> Aflatoxin B1 is the most common and biologically active%0a> of all the aflatoxins and causes decreased egg production%0a> and mortality. Clinically, the signs are anorexia, visceral%0a> hemorrhages, embryo toxicity, and increased susceptibility to%0a> stressors. Histopathology reveals fatty liver, liver necrosis, and%0a> bile duct hyperplasia. Aflatoxin B1 also suppresses the immune%0a> system and reduces vaccine response.%0a> Aflatoxins decrease the activities of several digestive enzymes,%0a> resulting in reduced feed conversion efficiency. Aflatoxins are%0a> known to interfere with vitamin D metabolism, contributing%0a> to reduced bone strength and leg weakness (19). Pale bird%0a> syndrome is as a result of poor%0a> pigmentation of skin and egg yolk%0a> caused by reduced absorption of fat%0a> and carotenoid pigments in affected%0a> birds.%0a> Suppression of hepatic protein%0a> synthesis is the main factor resulting%0a> in growth suppression and reduced egg%0a> production. Aflatoxins are also associated with%0a> poor fertility and hatchability. High levels of%0a> aflatoxins fed to hens resulted in a dramatic%0a> reduction in reproductive performance (34), as%0a> shown in Table 3.%0a> Perhaps the most important effect of aflatoxins%0a> is the immune-suppressing effect (9, 10) and%0a> consequent vaccine and therapeutic drug%0a> failures. Aflatoxin-induced immunosuppression%0a> results in reduced antibody levels, cell%0a> mediated immunity, and abnormal development of the%0a> thymus and bursa (see Table 4).%0a> Aflatoxicosis has also been shown to increase the%0a> susceptibility to Salmonella infection (13).%0a> The effects of aflatoxins on bird performance are dose%0a> dependent (see Table 5).%0a> Consideration must also be given to the potential%0a> human health risk, residues of aflatoxins can occur in%0a> poultry meat and eggs, as shown in Table 6.%0a> Figure 1.

They can be found in cereals, cereal byproducts, and feeds. Jewers, 1990 reported an 11%25 to 24%25 reduction in body weight in growing%0a> chicks fed with T-2 and diacetoxyscirpenol, which was caused by severe oral lesion dermatitis%0a> (Figure 2) and intestinal irritation (45). T-2 toxins are often referred to as ‘the feed refusal’ toxins.%0a> These mycotoxins result in reduced feed intake,%0a> reduced body weight, induced abnormal%0a> feathering, decreased egg production, thinning%0a> of eggshells, and regression of ovaries in laying%0a> birds (9, 44). The effect of T-2 toxin on laying%0a> hen performance has been demonstrated at%0a> different dosage levels (see Table 7).%0a> T-2 toxins have also been known to cause%0a> gizzard erosions and necrosis of the%0a> proventricular mucosa. They are the second%0a> most immune suppressive mycotoxins after%0a> aflatoxins, occurrence of both toxins is the most immunosuppressive combination of toxins (36).%0a> %0a> OCHRATOXINS%0a> Ochratoxin type A (OTA) is a common contaminant in a variety of%0a> feedstuffs, produced mainly by Aspergillus and Penicillium species.%0a> OTA is a nephrotoxin and significantly depresses feed intake,%0a> growth, feathering, egg production, and feed conversion efficiency%0a> (19). Eggshell quality can be affected along with yellow staining%0a> of eggshells and blood spots (12, 38). OTA is three times more%0a> toxic to young birds than aflatoxins. Severely affected birds show%0a> urate deposits in joints and in the abdominal cavity (see Figure 3)%0a> at higher doses. Diarrhea, tremors, and other neural malfunctions%0a> can also be observed (12). Acute OTA toxicity results in acute renal%0a> failure, leading to death.%0a> %0a> ZEARALENONE (ZEA) AND DEOXYNIVALENOL (DON)%0a> Zearalenone (ZEA) is responsible for reproductive disorders%0a> due to its estrogenic effect at high concentrations. Poultry are%0a> quite resistant to ZEA; however, at high concentrations, vent%0a> enlargement and enhanced secondary sex characteristics are seen.%0a> Layers are considered resistant to zearalenone even when fed at%0a> up to 800mg/kg (1); however, ZEA will contaminate eggs, which%0a> is a concern from a human health point of view, but also in terms%0a> of reproductive performance. Chicks derived from hens fed ZEAcontaminated feed contained ZEAs (5).%0a> Poultry are also quite resistant to deoxynivalenol (DON); however,%0a> there is an association with reduced feed intake in layers and%0a> breeders.

Kidney affected by%0a> ochratoxins.%0a> 4%0a> Technical Update – MYCOTOXINS%0a> %0a> FUMONISINS%0a> Fumonisins are found in tropical and temperate climates. Fumonisin B1 (FB1) is produced mainly by%0a> Fusarium verticillioides and naturally occurs in corn. Relatively high levels of Fumonisin B1 are required%0a> in order to show negative effects in poultry; however, when in combination with other mycotoxins%0a> such as aflatoxins, DON, and ZON, poultry are at greater risk (22). Performance-related effects include%0a> reduced weight gain and poor FCR. Clinical signs are spiking mortality, paralysis, extended legs and%0a> neck, poor gait, gasping, increased liver weight, and liver necrosis.%0a> %0a> CO-CONTAMINATION OF FEEDS BY MYCOTOXINS%0a> Co-contamination of mycotoxins appears to exert greater negative impact on health and productivity%0a> than do single toxins. For example, both aflatoxin and ochratoxin are extremely toxic to poultry%0a> and they act synergistically; the toxicity resulting from dual exposure to aflatoxin and ochratoxin is%0a> much greater than the sum of their individual toxicities. The effects of T-2 and DAS were additive in%0a> laying hens for feed intake, oral lesions, mild changes in plasma enzyme activities, and reduced egg%0a> production (16).%0a> Fungi do not occur in feedstuffs as pure cultures, so the number of possible combinations of toxins is%0a> very significant. The scientifically established co-contaminants are listed in Table 8.%0a> The key point is that a feedstuff testing positive for a particular toxin signifies that growing conditions%0a> were favorable not just for that fungi, but also for others; therefore, testing the feedstuff for other cocontaminants is important.%0a> %0a> MYCOTOXIN TESTING%0a> A testing schedule should be put in place to%0a> continuously assess the mycotoxin threat to%0a> the feedstuff, and also to assist in identifying%0a> contaminated lots.%0a> There is significant variability in the process of%0a> testing for mycotoxins brought about by the%0a> variability in sampling, sample preparation,%0a> and analytical variation. Table 9 shows the%0a> variability associated in measuring aflatoxin in%0a> a lot of contaminated corn; variation through%0a> sampling contributes to more than 75%25 of the%0a> overall error of testing (43).%0a> Sampling error is large because of the extreme distribution among contaminated particles within a lot;%0a> it is estimated that only 6 kernels in 10,000 are contaminated in a lot containing a concentration of 20%0a> parts per billion (ppb) aflatoxin (25).%0a> Aflatoxin DAS DON Fumonisin B Fusaric Acid Ochra-toxin T-2 Toxin%0a> Aflatoxin ++ + - - ++ ++%0a> DAS ++ - + - - ++%0a> DON + - - ++ - -%0a> Fumonisin B - + - - - +%0a> Fusaric Acid - - ++ - - -%0a> Ochratoxin ++ - - - - ++%0a> T-2 Toxin ++ ++ - + - ++%0a> + signifies an additive effect of toxins, ++ signifies a synergistic effect, - no known additive or synergistic effect%0a> Table 8.

Increasing the number of samples taken from a lot can increase the chances of identifying%0a> contaminated lots. Procedures used to take a sample from a bulk lot are extremely important; every%0a> individual item in the lot should have an equal chance of being chosen.%0a> The sample should be an accumulation of many small portions taken from many different locations%0a> throughout the lot (4). The general recommendation is to take incremental portions every 200 kg%0a> (441 lb) of product (17). The accumulation of several incremental portions is called a bulk sample%0a> or composite sample (see Figure 4). If the bulk sample is larger than desired, the bulk sample%0a> should be blended and subdivided until the desired sample size%0a> is achieved. The smallest sample size that is subdivided from the%0a> bulk sample and ground in the sample preparation step is called%0a> the test sample (42).%0a> *A test sample is removed from a bulk sample. A bulk sample is%0a> the accumulation of many small incremental portions taken from%0a> many different locations in the lot.%0a> When drawing a sample from a bulk container, a probing pattern%0a> should be developed so that product can be collected from%0a> different locations in the lot. An example of a probing pattern%0a> referred to by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)%0a> is shown in Figure 5.%0a> The sampling probe should be long enough to reach the bottom%0a> of the container when possible. When sampling from bags, the%0a> sample should be taken from many bags dispersed throughout%0a> the lot. Lanes between sacks allows access to sacks at interior%0a> locations. The recommended number of sacks sampled varies,%0a> from one in four for small lots, to the square root of the total%0a> number of sacks for large lots (17). When sampling from a%0a> moving stream, e.g. a moving belt, small increments should be%0a> taken along the entire length of the moving stream. Samples%0a> can be taken by an automatic crosscut sampling device or by%0a> hand; whatever collection method is used, it is important that%0a> the samples are taken frequently, at uniform intervals, and of%0a> the entire stream. Composite all the increments to obtain a bulk%0a> sample. If the bulk sample is larger than required, blend and%0a> subdivide the bulk sample to obtain the desired size test sample.%0a> Sample preparation involves reducing the size of the test%0a> sample to a quantity which can be analyzed. Granular products, such as maize grains, are ground%0a> prior to taking a sub sample, to reduce the particle size to as small as possible. This increases%0a> the homogeneity of the test sample, which will give a more accurate assessment of mycotoxin%0a> concentration (8).%0a> Figure 4: Test sample* (42)%0a> Figure 5. An example of a 5- and%0a> 8-probe sampling pattern (43).%0a> 6%0a> %0a> Technical Update – MYCOTOXINS%0a> %0a> ANALYZES%0a> Rapid strip tests: analyzes of feedstuffs for presence of mycotoxins can be conducted efficiently%0a> through the use of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) testing kits, which have become%0a> a standard tool for rapid monitoring of mycotoxins (31). This method is satisfactory in order to%0a> establish if a specific feedstuff is either under or over a legal compliance level.%0a> HPLC and GC-MS analyzes provides more accurate determination of the level and type of%0a> mycotoxins present in the feedstuff.%0a> Some toxins can escape detection, as they may be masked by glycosides or proteins attached to the%0a> toxin, giving a false negative result; more refined analyzes methods are required to measure such%0a> toxins.%0a> LS-MC/M is the latest technique, using liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass%0a> spectrometry, which is capable of detecting hundreds of mycotoxins that include masked and%0a> emerging mycotoxins and metabolites simultaneously in a sample (28). Bioassays are used to%0a> establish presence of specific mycotoxins. An example is using%0a> crustacea, such as Artemia saline (see Figure 6) and assessing%0a> survival rate from a sample of material (21, 30).%0a> %0a> PREVENTATIVE APPROACHES%0a> Assessing the mold levels of grain can indicate the likelihood of%0a> mycotoxins occurring.%0a> Testing the material for the level and type of mold can sometimes%0a> indicate the likelihood of mycotoxin contamination; however, it%0a> is possible that molds may no longer be present in the material,%0a> but mycotoxins are. The best practice is to analyze for both molds%0a> and mycotoxins.%0a> A general guide in terms of mold levels and possible actions are as follows:%0a> Mold killers (acids) give an instant%0a> mold kill, but can evaporate over%0a> time and therefore tend to offer%0a> short- to medium-term protection%0a> only. Salts give longer-term mold%0a> protection, as they release the%0a> acid in the presence of free water;%0a> they can be viewed as a reservoir%0a> of acid that is released whenever%0a> free water becomes available.%0a> Molds such as Aspergillus flavus%0a> are extremely common in nature%0a> and assumed to be present in%0a> most maize crops. Development%0a> of molds in the field are%0a> dependent on high temperature,%0a> high humidity, and high rainfall.%0a> Damage or stress to the plant by diseases, insect or bird damage, weeds, frost, or drought permits%0a> easy entrance of molds and fungi and promotes rapid development of molds. Insect-damaged grain%0a> is more vulnerable to mold growth, so reducing insect infestations is critical in preventing mold%0a> growth in grains. Some toxins, such as aflatoxins, tend to occur in broken and damaged kernels and%0a> in foreign material.%0a> %0a> Figure 6.

Mold level (spore count per gram of feedstuff).%0a> 7%0a> Avoid harvesting grain at an%0a> excessively high moisture content.%0a> A moisture meter can be helpful%0a> in making these decisions. Keep%0a> grains in a holding bin using%0a> forced air to keep cool. Store%0a> the grain in weatherproof, wellventilated facilities and monitor%0a> the temperature of stored grain.%0a> Drying the grain slowly and at%0a> low temperatures for long periods%0a> promotes aflatoxin development.%0a> All handling equipment and storage%0a> facilities must be kept well ventilated,%0a> clean, and dry prior to and during%0a> use. Storage facilities must be free%0a> of moisture leaks and all residue%0a> removed to reduce contamination.%0a> Apply liquid or dry mold inhibitors;%0a> use of organic acids such as%0a> propionic acid and ammonium%0a> isobutyrate will prevent mold growth%0a> if correctly applied as it is augured into the silo. Organic acids,%0a> however, will not destroy toxins already present in the grain (20).%0a> %0a> VISUAL ASSESSMENT OF THE LOT%0a> Look out for visual clues of contaminants. Grains can show signs%0a> of mold growth (see Figure 8) and/or insect damage and presence%0a> of "fines," which are associated with mold growth.%0a> %0a> CLEANING%0a> During the cleaning process of contaminated grain, dust, husks,%0a> hair, and shallow particles are blown away by aspiration or%0a> scouring. Grain cleaners have been shown to reduce the level of aflatoxin in maize grain by as much%0a> as 50%25.%0a> %0a> MECHANICAL SORTING AND SEPARATION%0a> Managing mycotoxin exposure should start at harvest by removing heavily contaminated grains%0a> when possible. In this process, the clean product is separated from mycotoxin-contaminated grains.%0a> High feed losses are possible due to incomplete and uncertain separation; therefore, mechanical%0a> sorting and separation is not always considered cost-efficient. If mycotoxin-affected grains must be%0a> used, dilution of the affected batches of grain is a cost-effective measure for reducing the impact%0a> of mycotoxins to the animal; however, multiple sampling and mycotoxin analysis are needed to%0a> determine the concentration of mycotoxin in every batch of feed. "Blending down" material which%0a> has been analyzed higher than maximum permitted levels of toxins is not permitted in some regions%0a> (especially if the material is destined for breeding animals).%0a> %0a> WASHING%0a> Washing procedures using water or sodium carbonate solution result in some reduction of%0a> mycotoxins in grains.%0a> Figure 7. A schematic diagram showing the steps taken to%0a> reduce the risk of mycotoxin exposure, from harvest through%0a> to delivery of the feedstuff to the farm.%0a> Figure 8. Maize grains%0a> contaminated with mold.%0a> 8%0a> %0a> Technical Update – MYCOTOXINS%0a> %0a> PROCESSING OF FEEDS%0a> Feed processing doesn’t necessarily reduce mycotoxin risk. Short-term exposure to pelleting%0a> temperatures of 70-80°C (158–176°F) is not enough to eliminate fungi (18). Further, deficient cooling%0a> conditions during processing of pelleted feed can lead to unwanted condensation during storage,%0a> which can result in the growth of molds.%0a> %0a> TREATMENT%0a> Nutritional Approaches%0a> • Increased levels of antioxidants, such as selenium and vitamins such as A, C, and E.%0a> • Increased levels of methionine: detoxification of aflatoxins involves the glutathione system,%0a> which contains cysteine; metabolic levels of methionine are depleted, leading to poor growth%0a> and feed efficiency.%0a> • Increased levels of choline: the presence of mycotoxins can have a negative impact on liver%0a> condition. Choline is synthesized in the liver and has a role in maintaining liver condition.%0a> Additional supplementation of choline maybe required to meet the bird's daily requirements,%0a> especially when mycotoxins are present.%0a> • Form of vitamin D3%0a> : vitamin D3%0a> undergoes conversion through two steps before it reaches the%0a> form that can be utilized by the bird. The first of these two changes occur in the liver. Feeding%0a> certain metabolites of Vit D3%0a> bypasses this first step, allowing more efficient and faster uptake%0a> of the required form of vitamin D3%0a> - 25OHD3%0a> . This approach is of particular importance if liver%0a> function has been compromised by mycotoxins.%0a> %0a> Chemical Detoxification%0a> Detoxification with ammonia or ammonia-related compounds is one of the most practical means%0a> of decontamination of aflatoxin in agricultural commodities (26). Dietary aflatoxin inactivation by%0a> ammonization for layer breeders had no detrimental effect on the immunological response elicited%0a> by Newcastle disease vaccination, as measured by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titers (7).%0a> Hydrogen peroxide is an oxidizing agent acceptable in foods and has the potential to destroy up to%0a> 97%25 of aflatoxins. Similar effects have been found with treatment by organic acids and surfactants%0a> (6, 37).%0a> %0a> Mycotoxin Sequestering Agents%0a> Supplementation with non-nutritive mycotoxin-sequestering agents is by far the most practical and%0a> most widely studied method for reducing the effects of mycotoxin exposure (15).%0a> %0a> Activated Charcoal%0a> Activated charcoal is an amorphous form of carbon heated in the absence of air and then treated%0a> with oxygen to increase porosity. There is some data to suggest activated charcoal is effective in%0a> absorbing some aflatoxins but not toxins derived from other species. Activated charcoal can also%0a> result in absorption of micronutrients in the feed.%0a> 9%0a> %0a> Silicate Minerals (Clays)%0a> Bentonine (Montmorillonite). Bentonites can be classified as calcium, magnesium, potassium or%0a> sodium bentonites. Several types of bentonites have been proven to bind aflatoxin B1 by as much as%0a> 66%25 by forming a complex with the toxin, both in-vitro and in-vivo. Formation of a complex with the%0a> toxin prevents absorption of the aflatoxin across the intestinal epithelium.%0a> • Zeolites are a group of silicates consisting of interlocking tetrahedrons of SiO4 and ALO4,%0a> which attract positive cations within the structure. Liver concentrations of aflatoxin B1 were%0a> reduced with the use of zeolite at 2%25 inclusion levels in the diet when layers were fed 2.5 ppm%0a> aflatoxin (46)%0a> • Hydrated sodium calcium aluminosilicate (HSCAS) is considered one of the most effective%0a> silicates for aflatoxin sequestration, due to its high affinity for and stable association with%0a> aflatoxin B1 (33).%0a> • Use of sodium alumino-silicate, hydrated sodium calcium aluminosilicate, and sodium%0a> bentonite can absorb aflatoxins; however, clays are mostly effective against mycotoxins but%0a> don’t appear to have significant effect on Fusarium and Penicillium-derived toxins. A potential%0a> negative effect in using clays is that they tend to reduce the utilization of manganese, zinc,%0a> magnesium chloride, copper,and sodium (13).%0a> • Mineral-based absorbents and activated carbon are generally used at high concentrations in%0a> the feed, which is a disadvantage in high nutrient density monogastric diets. High levels of%0a> inclusion could provide excessive sequestration capacity that may decrease the bioavailability%0a> of important micronutrients (15).%0a> %0a> Yeast Cell Wall-Based Adsorbents%0a> Yeast cell wall derivatives, principally modified glucomannan, can adsorb higher levels of several%0a> mycotoxins at lower inclusion rates than inorganic binders (27). The specific mode of action of some%0a> yeast cell wall components suggests that their activity would not affect the availability of micronutrients. Modified glucomannan has been shown to bind Fusarium-derived toxin. Tests conducted%0a> at four concentrations of T-2 toxin (0, 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 mg/kg) and two concentrations of a commercial%0a> preparation of modified glucomannan reversed the suppression of egg production by T-2 toxin; this%0a> effect was observed at the highest level of T-2 toxin (2mg/kg) (29). Layers given feed contaminated%0a> with several Fusarium toxins experienced reduced feed intake and egg production; supplementation%0a> with a modified glucomannan prevented these effects (11).%0a> %0a> Biotransformation%0a> Biological detoxification by enzymes and/or microorganisms degrades mycotoxins within the%0a> gastrointestinal tract, before resorption into the animal occurs. There are now enzyme and%0a> microorganism-based products effective in transforming specific toxins such as Fumonisins and%0a> Trichothecenes into nontoxic metabolites.%0a> 10%0a> %0a> Technical Update – MYCOTOXINS%0a> %0a> SUMMARY%0a> • Prevent fungal growth on crops in the field, at harvest, and during storage of feedstuffs and%0a> processing of feed.%0a> • Implement mechanical means of removing contaminated material from the feedstuff and%0a> consider addition of mold inhibitors/killers.%0a> • Implement a mycotoxin testing and surveillance schedule.

Several of which,%0a%3c when ingested by humans and animals above a certain concentration, will cause a toxic response%0a%3c called mycotoxicosis. Mycotoxin-producing molds also damage crops, which can cause significant%0a%3c economic losses at all levels of food and feed production.%0a%3c Toxin production requires a) the presence of a mold; b) a suitable substrate; and c) a suitable%0a%3c environment. If a mold is present, toxin production is influenced by moisture, temperature, oxygen,%0a%3c and nature of substrate. Most plant feedstuffs will provide a suitable substrate. Molds not only%0a%3c produce mycotoxins, but also reduce the nutrient value of feed (30).%0a%3c %0a%3c MAJOR MYCOTOXINS IN POULTRY%0a%3c  The most significant mycotoxin-related%0a%3c risks in poultry are associated with fungi%0a%3c of the genera Aspergillus, Fusarium,%0a%3c and Penicillium. These fungi and their%0a%3c mycotoxins are produced either preharvest, during harvest, in storage,%0a%3c or during feed processing whenever%0a%3c conditions are favorable. Fusarium%0a%3c species are field fungi that invade grains%0a%3c during the growth of the plant, and%0a%3c Aspergillus and Penicillium species are%0a%3c storage fungi which generally develop%0a%3c after harvesting.%0a%3c Some fungal strains can produce%0a%3c more than one mycotoxin and a single%0a%3c mycotoxin can be produced by more%0a%3c than one fungus, meaning birds are%0a%3c generally exposed to not just one%0a%3c mycotoxin but to several toxins at%0a%3c the same time. The most important%0a%3c mycotoxins for poultry and the fungi%0a%3c that produce them are shown in %0a%3c %0a%3c Table 2.%0a%3c Parameter Good Corn Moldy Corn Reduction (%25)%0a%3c Total Fat (%25) 3.8 2.4 36.8%0a%3c Fatty Acid Content Palmitic (16:0) 11.3 9.1 19.5%0a%3c Metabolizable Energy (kcal/kg) 3350 2510 25.1%0a%3c Carotene (mg/kg) 3.1 2.3 25.8%0a%3c Table 1.

The toxin occurs in%0a%3c warm and humid climatic conditions and is not considered a problem in colder climates; however,%0a%3c the global availability of feed stuffs means contaminated materials can be transported anywhere in%0a%3c the world.%0a%3c Aflatoxin B1 is the most common and biologically active%0a%3c of all the aflatoxins and causes decreased egg production%0a%3c and mortality. Clinically, the signs are anorexia, visceral%0a%3c hemorrhages, embryo toxicity, and increased susceptibility to%0a%3c stressors. Histopathology reveals fatty liver, liver necrosis, and%0a%3c bile duct hyperplasia. Aflatoxin B1 also suppresses the immune%0a%3c system and reduces vaccine response.%0a%3c Aflatoxins decrease the activities of several digestive enzymes,%0a%3c resulting in reduced feed conversion efficiency. Aflatoxins are%0a%3c known to interfere with vitamin D metabolism, contributing%0a%3c to reduced bone strength and leg weakness (19). Pale bird%0a%3c syndrome is as a result of poor%0a%3c pigmentation of skin and egg yolk%0a%3c caused by reduced absorption of fat%0a%3c and carotenoid pigments in affected%0a%3c birds.%0a%3c Suppression of hepatic protein%0a%3c synthesis is the main factor resulting%0a%3c in growth suppression and reduced egg%0a%3c production. Aflatoxins are also associated with%0a%3c poor fertility and hatchability. High levels of%0a%3c aflatoxins fed to hens resulted in a dramatic%0a%3c reduction in reproductive performance (34), as%0a%3c shown in Table 3.%0a%3c Perhaps the most important effect of aflatoxins%0a%3c is the immune-suppressing effect (9, 10) and%0a%3c consequent vaccine and therapeutic drug%0a%3c failures. Aflatoxin-induced immunosuppression%0a%3c results in reduced antibody levels, cell%0a%3c mediated immunity, and abnormal development of the%0a%3c thymus and bursa (see Table 4).%0a%3c Aflatoxicosis has also been shown to increase the%0a%3c susceptibility to Salmonella infection (13).%0a%3c The effects of aflatoxins on bird performance are dose%0a%3c dependent (see Table 5).%0a%3c Consideration must also be given to the potential%0a%3c human health risk, residues of aflatoxins can occur in%0a%3c poultry meat and eggs, as shown in Table 6.%0a%3c Figure 1.

They can be found in cereals, cereal byproducts, and feeds. Jewers, 1990 reported an 11%25 to 24%25 reduction in body weight in growing%0a%3c chicks fed with T-2 and diacetoxyscirpenol, which was caused by severe oral lesion dermatitis%0a%3c (Figure 2) and intestinal irritation (45). T-2 toxins are often referred to as ‘the feed refusal’ toxins.%0a%3c These mycotoxins result in reduced feed intake,%0a%3c reduced body weight, induced abnormal%0a%3c feathering, decreased egg production, thinning%0a%3c of eggshells, and regression of ovaries in laying%0a%3c birds (9, 44). The effect of T-2 toxin on laying%0a%3c hen performance has been demonstrated at%0a%3c different dosage levels (see Table 7).%0a%3c T-2 toxins have also been known to cause%0a%3c gizzard erosions and necrosis of the%0a%3c proventricular mucosa. They are the second%0a%3c most immune suppressive mycotoxins after%0a%3c aflatoxins, occurrence of both toxins is the most immunosuppressive combination of toxins (36).%0a%3c %0a%3c OCHRATOXINS%0a%3c Ochratoxin type A (OTA) is a common contaminant in a variety of%0a%3c feedstuffs, produced mainly by Aspergillus and Penicillium species.%0a%3c OTA is a nephrotoxin and significantly depresses feed intake,%0a%3c growth, feathering, egg production, and feed conversion efficiency%0a%3c (19). Eggshell quality can be affected along with yellow staining%0a%3c of eggshells and blood spots (12, 38). OTA is three times more%0a%3c toxic to young birds than aflatoxins. Severely affected birds show%0a%3c urate deposits in joints and in the abdominal cavity (see Figure 3)%0a%3c at higher doses. Diarrhea, tremors, and other neural malfunctions%0a%3c can also be observed (12). Acute OTA toxicity results in acute renal%0a%3c failure, leading to death.%0a%3c %0a%3c ZEARALENONE (ZEA) AND DEOXYNIVALENOL (DON)%0a%3c Zearalenone (ZEA) is responsible for reproductive disorders%0a%3c due to its estrogenic effect at high concentrations. Poultry are%0a%3c quite resistant to ZEA; however, at high concentrations, vent%0a%3c enlargement and enhanced secondary sex characteristics are seen.%0a%3c Layers are considered resistant to zearalenone even when fed at%0a%3c up to 800mg/kg (1); however, ZEA will contaminate eggs, which%0a%3c is a concern from a human health point of view, but also in terms%0a%3c of reproductive performance. Chicks derived from hens fed ZEAcontaminated feed contained ZEAs (5).%0a%3c Poultry are also quite resistant to deoxynivalenol (DON); however,%0a%3c there is an association with reduced feed intake in layers and%0a%3c breeders. The toxin is sometimes considered an indicator that other more potent Fusarium are%0a%3c present.%0a%3c T-2 toxin%0a%3c (ppm)%0a%3c Egg%0a%3c Production%0a%3c (%25)%0a%3c Egg Weight%0a%3c (g)%0a%3c Body%0a%3c Weight (g)%0a%3c 0.0 96.29 52.45 1332%0a%3c 0.5 93.81 51.77 1313%0a%3c 1.0 91.75 51.35 1286%0a%3c 2.0 86.65 51.33 1285%0a%3c Table 7.

Kidney affected by%0a%3c ochratoxins.%0a%3c  4%0a%3c Technical Update – MYCOTOXINS%0a%3c %0a%3c FUMONISINS%0a%3c Fumonisins are found in tropical and temperate climates. Fumonisin B1 (FB1) is produced mainly by%0a%3c Fusarium verticillioides and naturally occurs in corn. Relatively high levels of Fumonisin B1 are required%0a%3c in order to show negative effects in poultry; however, when in combination with other mycotoxins%0a%3c such as aflatoxins, DON, and ZON, poultry are at greater risk (22). Performance-related effects include%0a%3c reduced weight gain and poor FCR. Clinical signs are spiking mortality, paralysis, extended legs and%0a%3c neck, poor gait, gasping, increased liver weight, and liver necrosis.%0a%3c %0a%3c CO-CONTAMINATION OF FEEDS BY MYCOTOXINS%0a%3c Co-contamination of mycotoxins appears to exert greater negative impact on health and productivity%0a%3c than do single toxins. For example, both aflatoxin and ochratoxin are extremely toxic to poultry%0a%3c and they act synergistically; the toxicity resulting from dual exposure to aflatoxin and ochratoxin is%0a%3c much greater than the sum of their individual toxicities. The effects of T-2 and DAS were additive in%0a%3c laying hens for feed intake, oral lesions, mild changes in plasma enzyme activities, and reduced egg%0a%3c production (16).%0a%3c Fungi do not occur in feedstuffs as pure cultures, so the number of possible combinations of toxins is%0a%3c very significant. The scientifically established co-contaminants are listed in Table 8.%0a%3c The key point is that a feedstuff testing positive for a particular toxin signifies that growing conditions%0a%3c were favorable not just for that fungi, but also for others; therefore, testing the feedstuff for other cocontaminants is important.%0a%3c %0a%3c MYCOTOXIN TESTING%0a%3c A testing schedule should be put in place to%0a%3c continuously assess the mycotoxin threat to%0a%3c the feedstuff, and also to assist in identifying%0a%3c contaminated lots.%0a%3c There is significant variability in the process of%0a%3c testing for mycotoxins brought about by the%0a%3c variability in sampling, sample preparation,%0a%3c and analytical variation. Table 9 shows the%0a%3c variability associated in measuring aflatoxin in%0a%3c a lot of contaminated corn; variation through%0a%3c sampling contributes to more than 75%25 of the%0a%3c overall error of testing (43).%0a%3c Sampling error is large because of the extreme distribution among contaminated particles within a lot;%0a%3c it is estimated that only 6 kernels in 10,000 are contaminated in a lot containing a concentration of 20%0a%3c parts per billion (ppb) aflatoxin (25).%0a%3c Aflatoxin DAS DON Fumonisin B Fusaric Acid Ochra-toxin T-2 Toxin%0a%3c Aflatoxin ++ + - - ++ ++%0a%3c DAS ++ - + - - ++%0a%3c DON + - - ++ - -%0a%3c Fumonisin B - + - - - +%0a%3c Fusaric Acid - - ++ - - -%0a%3c Ochratoxin ++ - - - - ++%0a%3c T-2 Toxin ++ ++ - + - ++%0a%3c + signifies an additive effect of toxins, ++ signifies a synergistic effect, - no known additive or synergistic effect%0a%3c Table 8.

Increasing the number of samples taken from a lot can increase the chances of identifying%0a%3c contaminated lots. Procedures used to take a sample from a bulk lot are extremely important; every%0a%3c individual item in the lot should have an equal chance of being chosen.%0a%3c The sample should be an accumulation of many small portions taken from many different locations%0a%3c throughout the lot (4). The general recommendation is to take incremental portions every 200 kg%0a%3c (441 lb) of product (17). The accumulation of several incremental portions is called a bulk sample%0a%3c or composite sample (see Figure 4). If the bulk sample is larger than desired, the bulk sample%0a%3c should be blended and subdivided until the desired sample size%0a%3c is achieved. The smallest sample size that is subdivided from the%0a%3c bulk sample and ground in the sample preparation step is called%0a%3c the test sample (42).%0a%3c *A test sample is removed from a bulk sample. A bulk sample is%0a%3c the accumulation of many small incremental portions taken from%0a%3c many different locations in the lot.%0a%3c When drawing a sample from a bulk container, a probing pattern%0a%3c should be developed so that product can be collected from%0a%3c different locations in the lot. An example of a probing pattern%0a%3c referred to by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)%0a%3c is shown in Figure 5.%0a%3c The sampling probe should be long enough to reach the bottom%0a%3c of the container when possible. When sampling from bags, the%0a%3c sample should be taken from many bags dispersed throughout%0a%3c the lot. Lanes between sacks allows access to sacks at interior%0a%3c locations. The recommended number of sacks sampled varies,%0a%3c from one in four for small lots, to the square root of the total%0a%3c number of sacks for large lots (17). When sampling from a%0a%3c moving stream, e.g. a moving belt, small increments should be%0a%3c taken along the entire length of the moving stream. Samples%0a%3c can be taken by an automatic crosscut sampling device or by%0a%3c hand; whatever collection method is used, it is important that%0a%3c the samples are taken frequently, at uniform intervals, and of%0a%3c the entire stream. Composite all the increments to obtain a bulk%0a%3c sample. If the bulk sample is larger than required, blend and%0a%3c subdivide the bulk sample to obtain the desired size test sample.%0a%3c Sample preparation involves reducing the size of the test%0a%3c sample to a quantity which can be analyzed. Granular products, such as maize grains, are ground%0a%3c prior to taking a sub sample, to reduce the particle size to as small as possible. This increases%0a%3c the homogeneity of the test sample, which will give a more accurate assessment of mycotoxin%0a%3c concentration (8).%0a%3c Figure 4: Test sample* (42)%0a%3c Figure 5. An example of a 5- and%0a%3c 8-probe sampling pattern (43).%0a%3c  6%0a%3c %0a%3c Technical Update – MYCOTOXINS%0a%3c %0a%3c ANALYZES%0a%3c Rapid strip tests: analyzes of feedstuffs for presence of mycotoxins can be conducted efficiently%0a%3c through the use of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) testing kits, which have become%0a%3c a standard tool for rapid monitoring of mycotoxins (31). This method is satisfactory in order to%0a%3c establish if a specific feedstuff is either under or over a legal compliance level.%0a%3c HPLC and GC-MS analyzes provides more accurate determination of the level and type of%0a%3c mycotoxins present in the feedstuff.%0a%3c Some toxins can escape detection, as they may be masked by glycosides or proteins attached to the%0a%3c toxin, giving a false negative result; more refined analyzes methods are required to measure such%0a%3c toxins.%0a%3c LS-MC/M is the latest technique, using liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass%0a%3c spectrometry, which is capable of detecting hundreds of mycotoxins that include masked and%0a%3c emerging mycotoxins and metabolites simultaneously in a sample (28). Bioassays are used to%0a%3c establish presence of specific mycotoxins. An example is using%0a%3c crustacea, such as Artemia saline (see Figure 6) and assessing%0a%3c survival rate from a sample of material (21, 30).%0a%3c PREVENTATIVE APPROACHES%0a%3c Assessing the mold levels of grain can indicate the likelihood of%0a%3c mycotoxins occurring.%0a%3c Testing the material for the level and type of mold can sometimes%0a%3c indicate the likelihood of mycotoxin contamination; however, it%0a%3c is possible that molds may no longer be present in the material,%0a%3c but mycotoxins are. The best practice is to analyze for both molds%0a%3c and mycotoxins.%0a%3c A general guide in terms of mold levels and possible actions are as follows:%0a%3c Mold killers (acids) give an instant%0a%3c mold kill, but can evaporate over%0a%3c time and therefore tend to offer%0a%3c short- to medium-term protection%0a%3c only. Salts give longer-term mold%0a%3c protection, as they release the%0a%3c acid in the presence of free water;%0a%3c they can be viewed as a reservoir%0a%3c of acid that is released whenever%0a%3c free water becomes available.%0a%3c Molds such as Aspergillus flavus%0a%3c are extremely common in nature%0a%3c and assumed to be present in%0a%3c most maize crops. Development%0a%3c of molds in the field are%0a%3c dependent on high temperature,%0a%3c high humidity, and high rainfall.%0a%3c Damage or stress to the plant by diseases, insect or bird damage, weeds, frost, or drought permits%0a%3c easy entrance of molds and fungi and promotes rapid development of molds. Insect-damaged grain%0a%3c is more vulnerable to mold growth, so reducing insect infestations is critical in preventing mold%0a%3c growth in grains. Some toxins, such as aflatoxins, tend to occur in broken and damaged kernels and%0a%3c in foreign material.%0a%3c %0a%3c Figure 6.

Mold level (spore count per gram of feedstuff).%0a%3c 7%0a%3c Avoid harvesting grain at an%0a%3c excessively high moisture content.%0a%3c A moisture meter can be helpful%0a%3c in making these decisions. Keep%0a%3c grains in a holding bin using%0a%3c forced air to keep cool. Store%0a%3c the grain in weatherproof, wellventilated facilities and monitor%0a%3c the temperature of stored grain.%0a%3c Drying the grain slowly and at%0a%3c low temperatures for long periods%0a%3c promotes aflatoxin development.%0a%3c All handling equipment and storage%0a%3c facilities must be kept well ventilated,%0a%3c clean, and dry prior to and during%0a%3c use. Storage facilities must be free%0a%3c of moisture leaks and all residue%0a%3c removed to reduce contamination.%0a%3c Apply liquid or dry mold inhibitors;%0a%3c use of organic acids such as%0a%3c propionic acid and ammonium%0a%3c isobutyrate will prevent mold growth%0a%3c if correctly applied as it is augured into the silo. Organic acids,%0a%3c however, will not destroy toxins already present in the grain (20).%0a%3c %0a%3c VISUAL ASSESSMENT OF THE LOT%0a%3c Look out for visual clues of contaminants. Grains can show signs%0a%3c of mold growth (see Figure 8) and/or insect damage and presence%0a%3c of "fines," which are associated with mold growth.%0a%3c %0a%3c CLEANING%0a%3c During the cleaning process of contaminated grain, dust, husks,%0a%3c hair, and shallow particles are blown away by aspiration or%0a%3c scouring. Grain cleaners have been shown to reduce the level of aflatoxin in maize grain by as much%0a%3c as 50%25.%0a%3c %0a%3c MECHANICAL SORTING AND SEPARATION%0a%3c Managing mycotoxin exposure should start at harvest by removing heavily contaminated grains%0a%3c when possible. In this process, the clean product is separated from mycotoxin-contaminated grains.%0a%3c High feed losses are possible due to incomplete and uncertain separation; therefore, mechanical%0a%3c sorting and separation is not always considered cost-efficient. If mycotoxin-affected grains must be%0a%3c used, dilution of the affected batches of grain is a cost-effective measure for reducing the impact%0a%3c of mycotoxins to the animal; however, multiple sampling and mycotoxin analysis are needed to%0a%3c determine the concentration of mycotoxin in every batch of feed. "Blending down" material which%0a%3c has been analyzed higher than maximum permitted levels of toxins is not permitted in some regions%0a%3c (especially if the material is destined for breeding animals).%0a%3c %0a%3c WASHING%0a%3c Washing procedures using water or sodium carbonate solution result in some reduction of%0a%3c mycotoxins in grains.%0a%3c Figure 7. A schematic diagram showing the steps taken to%0a%3c reduce the risk of mycotoxin exposure, from harvest through%0a%3c to delivery of the feedstuff to the farm.%0a%3c Figure 8. Maize grains%0a%3c contaminated with mold.%0a%3c  8%0a%3c %0a%3c Technical Update – MYCOTOXINS%0a%3c %0a%3c PROCESSING OF FEEDS%0a%3c Feed processing doesn’t necessarily reduce mycotoxin risk. Short-term exposure to pelleting%0a%3c temperatures of 70-80°C (158–176°F) is not enough to eliminate fungi (18). Further, deficient cooling%0a%3c conditions during processing of pelleted feed can lead to unwanted condensation during storage,%0a%3c which can result in the growth of molds.%0a%3c %0a%3c TREATMENT%0a%3c Nutritional Approaches%0a%3c • Increased levels of antioxidants, such as selenium and vitamins such as A, C, and E.%0a%3c • Increased levels of methionine: detoxification of aflatoxins involves the glutathione system,%0a%3c which contains cysteine; metabolic levels of methionine are depleted, leading to poor growth%0a%3c and feed efficiency.%0a%3c • Increased levels of choline: the presence of mycotoxins can have a negative impact on liver%0a%3c condition. Choline is synthesized in the liver and has a role in maintaining liver condition.%0a%3c Additional supplementation of choline maybe required to meet the bird's daily requirements,%0a%3c especially when mycotoxins are present.%0a%3c • Form of vitamin D3%0a%3c : vitamin D3%0a%3c  undergoes conversion through two steps before it reaches the%0a%3c form that can be utilized by the bird. The first of these two changes occur in the liver. Feeding%0a%3c certain metabolites of Vit D3%0a%3c  bypasses this first step, allowing more efficient and faster uptake%0a%3c of the required form of vitamin D3%0a%3c  - 25OHD3%0a%3c . This approach is of particular importance if liver%0a%3c function has been compromised by mycotoxins.%0a%3c %0a%3c Chemical Detoxification%0a%3c Detoxification with ammonia or ammonia-related compounds is one of the most practical means%0a%3c of decontamination of aflatoxin in agricultural commodities (26). Dietary aflatoxin inactivation by%0a%3c ammonization for layer breeders had no detrimental effect on the immunological response elicited%0a%3c by Newcastle disease vaccination, as measured by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titers (7).%0a%3c Hydrogen peroxide is an oxidizing agent acceptable in foods and has the potential to destroy up to%0a%3c 97%25 of aflatoxins. Similar effects have been found with treatment by organic acids and surfactants%0a%3c (6, 37).%0a%3c %0a%3c Mycotoxin Sequestering Agents%0a%3c Supplementation with non-nutritive mycotoxin-sequestering agents is by far the most practical and%0a%3c most widely studied method for reducing the effects of mycotoxin exposure (15).%0a%3c %0a%3c Activated Charcoal%0a%3c Activated charcoal is an amorphous form of carbon heated in the absence of air and then treated%0a%3c with oxygen to increase porosity. There is some data to suggest activated charcoal is effective in%0a%3c absorbing some aflatoxins but not toxins derived from other species. Activated charcoal can also%0a%3c result in absorption of micronutrients in the feed.%0a%3c 9%0a%3c %0a%3c Silicate Minerals (Clays)%0a%3c Bentonine (Montmorillonite). Bentonites can be classified as calcium, magnesium, potassium or%0a%3c sodium bentonites. Several types of bentonites have been proven to bind aflatoxin B1 by as much as%0a%3c 66%25 by forming a complex with the toxin, both in-vitro and in-vivo. Formation of a complex with the%0a%3c toxin prevents absorption of the aflatoxin across the intestinal epithelium.%0a%3c • Zeolites are a group of silicates consisting of interlocking tetrahedrons of SiO4 and ALO4,%0a%3c which attract positive cations within the structure. Liver concentrations of aflatoxin B1 were%0a%3c reduced with the use of zeolite at 2%25 inclusion levels in the diet when layers were fed 2.5 ppm%0a%3c aflatoxin (46)%0a%3c • Hydrated sodium calcium aluminosilicate (HSCAS) is considered one of the most effective%0a%3c silicates for aflatoxin sequestration, due to its high affinity for and stable association with%0a%3c aflatoxin B1 (33).%0a%3c • Use of sodium alumino-silicate, hydrated sodium calcium aluminosilicate, and sodium%0a%3c bentonite can absorb aflatoxins; however, clays are mostly effective against mycotoxins but%0a%3c don’t appear to have significant effect on Fusarium and Penicillium-derived toxins. A potential%0a%3c negative effect in using clays is that they tend to reduce the utilization of manganese, zinc,%0a%3c magnesium chloride, copper,and sodium (13).%0a%3c • Mineral-based absorbents and activated carbon are generally used at high concentrations in%0a%3c the feed, which is a disadvantage in high nutrient density monogastric diets. High levels of%0a%3c inclusion could provide excessive sequestration capacity that may decrease the bioavailability%0a%3c of important micronutrients (15).%0a%3c %0a%3c Yeast Cell Wall-Based Adsorbents%0a%3c Yeast cell wall derivatives, principally modified glucomannan, can adsorb higher levels of several%0a%3c mycotoxins at lower inclusion rates than inorganic binders (27). The specific mode of action of some%0a%3c yeast cell wall components suggests that their activity would not affect the availability of micronutrients. Modified glucomannan has been shown to bind Fusarium-derived toxin. Tests conducted%0a%3c at four concentrations of T-2 toxin (0, 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 mg/kg) and two concentrations of a commercial%0a%3c preparation of modified glucomannan reversed the suppression of egg production by T-2 toxin; this%0a%3c effect was observed at the highest level of T-2 toxin (2mg/kg) (29). Layers given feed contaminated%0a%3c with several Fusarium toxins experienced reduced feed intake and egg production; supplementation%0a%3c with a modified glucomannan prevented these effects (11).%0a%3c %0a%3c Biotransformation%0a%3c Biological detoxification by enzymes and/or microorganisms degrades mycotoxins within the%0a%3c gastrointestinal tract, before resorption into the animal occurs. There are now enzyme and%0a%3c microorganism-based products effective in transforming specific toxins such as Fumonisins and%0a%3c Trichothecenes into nontoxic metabolites.%0a%3c  10%0a%3c %0a%3c Technical Update – MYCOTOXINS%0a%3c %0a%3c SUMMARY%0a%3c • Prevent fungal growth on crops in the field, at harvest, and during storage of feedstuffs and%0a%3c processing of feed.%0a%3c • Implement mechanical means of removing contaminated material from the feedstuff and%0a%3c consider addition of mold inhibitors/killers.%0a%3c • Implement a mycotoxin testing and surveillance schedule. This is important not just from the%0a%3c point of risk assessment to livestock, but also from a regulatory and human health point of%0a%3c view.%0a%3c • Apply a robust sampling plan. Increasing the number and size of samples taken from a lot can%0a%3c increase the effectiveness of testing and the chances of identifying contaminated lots.%0a%3c • Detect and quantify the mold and mycotoxin concentration in the feedstuff, remembering%0a%3c many mycotoxins co-contaminate materials—detection of one toxin may indicate presence of%0a%3c another, more toxic mycotoxin.%0a%3c • When the feedstuff has been identified as contaminated, act before the birds consume the%0a%3c feed, not after the birds are affected by the toxin.%0a%3c • Remove and replace the feed or apply an appropriate mycotoxin binder or bio-transforming%0a%3c agent specific to the type of toxin recovered in the feed.%0a%3c • Monitor the flock for any performance or clinical related signs of mycotoxicosis.%0a%3c %0a%3c REFERENCES%0a%3c 1.
