Or on the same note, how do you play a multiplayer online game without a central server and have rewards that can be applied and recognized by a wide group of players?  Each action could be a transaction on a blockchain.  Random rolls can be done by the current block hash.%0a%0a!!Methodology%0a%0a#The player needs GAME NFT to play and should be issued by a trusted party.  This NFT can be permanent or might get used up over time, perhaps with higher rarity NFT's lasting longer.  This is the monetization possibility for the creator of the game.  These NFT's can also be mined in a [[CryptoProjects.CollectBit]] like system as another option to them bieng sold.  Or a combination of the two, an NFT is sold and is the input to mining a CollectBit token that is used to access the game.%0a%0a#The player also needs blockchain coins to pay transaction fees.  This is the monetization for the miners (maintainers/referees) of the network. In [[CryptoProjects.ErgonFork]], Ergon burns half the transaction fees to prevent a vulnerability in proportional reward which is fine.%0a%0a#The player makes transactions for character creation and the dice rolls are based on the blockhash(es).  You can only make a certain number of characters based on the game creators GAME NFT you are using. Or perhaps only one character of each class to prevent re-rolling.  A Firona Vie Ruleset would mean you can only create one character and cannot re-roll to get better stats, unless you are willing to buy another GAME NFT.%0a%0a#The player then will make a transaction to declare what type of objective they are completing everytime they attempt something, like a level 1 dungeon for example.%0a%0a#They will then make nft-like (encodes for the specific action) transactions every specified period of time and the blockhash that the transaction appears in gives a random roll for the current event.  So each member of the same group should be using different blocks for their transactions if possible, to get different random rolls.%0a%0a#Once the event is completed sucessfully then a reward token or NFT (hereby refered to as token) is granted.%0a%0a#This token will be issued via a [[CryptoProjects.BlockTock]] like mechanism using colored coins like protocol.%0a%0a#Block explorers will be able to list all the players and their gear and level, location in the world, and items equipped and in inventory along with their stats and skills/spells.  All of this based on the trail that the above process leaves in the blockchain.%0a%0a#Block explorers would need to be programmed specifically for each game they support, as codes will have specific meaning to each game itself.%0a%0a!!Portals%0a%0aA proof of play blockchain would likely launch with a standard game but all someone needs to do to create their own game on the blockchain, just create an NFT and follow the standards for cross compatibility.  They could make a whole new world, new items, quests, locations, class names, skills, spells, graphics or pen and paper or VR, etc. %0a%0aLets say the standard game is level 1-25.  Another game could be 10-25.  Or another one 25-50.  You will just need to meet that level req in the standard game or another one that starts at level 1, then you can fork your character into the new dimension (new game).  Your character will still be in the old game too and can still be played like normal. You will need to aquire the new game's NFT to open the portal.  The game creator could sell these to fund the project or allow them to be mined with a [[Digital Collectible Network]] if he wants his game to be free but prevent bots.%0a%0aIn-game cross compatible items and stats would be tokens and non cross compatible things can be NFT's.  The cross compatible items will continue on across other dimensions but the special NFT items will not make the journey, unless the new game specifically supports that certain NFT.  NFT's issued in the games can be rewards for GM events, even sold by the developer to make money (discouraged).  But NFT items will likely not be able to be issued autonomously in game except for potentially if they are mined by [[Digital Collectible Network]].%0a%0a!!Optimizing Block Time [[#time]]%0a%0aIn AD&D 2e, rounds are 1 minute (and also chess [[https://sports.answers.com/Q/How_long_do_you_have_to_move_a_chess_piece|#]] or some multiple of 1 minute) [[https://boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/4364/what-are-the-standard-time-settings-in-chess|#]] so blocktime should be some divisor of 1 minute.  Further, AD&D rounds were divided into 10 segments each of 6 seconds each in which PC's (player characters) would act [[https://rpg.stackexchange.com/questions/79136/what-are-turns-and-rounds-and-how-long-are-they-each|#]].%0a%0aSo 1 min or 30 sec or 20 sec or 15 sec or 12 sec or 10 sec or 7.5 seconds or 6.67 seconds or 6 sec blocktimes would be ideal (no blocktime should go below 6 seconds because of propagation time in the network would be no less than 0.15 seconds) [[https://www.quora.com/Light-would-take-0-13-seconds-to-travel-around-Earth-Is-it-true-Why|#]]. 15 second would be ideal for block propogation bieng 2 orders of magnitude smaller than mining time, but 6 seconds would give you 10 rolls per minute which would be ideal for an 8 party group fighting 2 monsters, and puts 'maximum speed propogation' as only 2.5%25 of mining time, which is acceptable.  In reality it may be as high as 10%25 of mining time which is workable, and will improve over time.  %0a%0aSix second blocks would work both for AD&D and 5e where in AD&D every player would act staggered once a minute, and in 5e players act every 6 seconds [[https://rpg.stackexchange.com/questions/79136/what-are-turns-and-rounds-and-how-long-are-they-each|#]] however AD&D would work better, since in the 6 second tick version (5e), everyone would be using the same rolls which is less optimal.  To offset everyone using the same rolls, each character could have a unique identifier (probably the NFT you are using to play the game) that they hash with the block hash (concatenate the two then hash), then convert to whatever base the dice roll is (ie: if you are rolling a d20 you would convert the hash to base20) to give everyone a unique roll every time.%0a%0aAD&D would be best for group play, and 5e for solo play.%0a%0a!!Preventing bots%0a%0aHow to prevent bots?  A bot couldn't play any faster than a human, but they could play multiple characters at the same time.  %0a%0aOne way to mitigate this is requiring the GAME NFT issued by a trusted party.  The trusted party would be responsible for verifying that each NFT is only going one per person.  This can be done with [[https://zenodo.org/record/5310137|Online pseudonym parties]].%0a%0aThe GAME NFT is the key to unlock the door to the game.  Also this NFT could get used up over time, disincentivizing bots spending significant money to earn digital goods.  Also transaction fees in blockchain coins would mean the bot would have to spend real money to earn niche virtual goods.%0a%0aAlso important items (and the original game purchase NFT) could be flagged with 'no trade' so players would have to earn them themselves, disincentivizing bots.  Of course someone could create a modded version of the game that allows every item to be traded, but that would be a different game and it wouldn't work in the original game. %0a%0aBasically you have to make it where the sentimental value of the virtual goods is the reward, and the real value of the goods is less than the real value that was spent to attain them.  Basically it is like buying a gallon of milk to get a [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pogs|pog]], no one would buy 100 gallons of milk just to get 100 pogs, the pog is an incidental reward for drinking milk.  The same needs to be done for the in-game rewards to make botting infeasible.%0a%0a!!Notes%0a%0aBasically this is a specialized [[CryptoProjects.ProofOfTransaction]] system.  More specifically using a string of transactions to prove engagement.%0a%0aMay be a large interconnected long term game that can last decades similar to [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ-ehbVQYxI|#]]%0a%0aPotential implementation on dogecoin [[https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoindev/comments/vxetdk/dogecoin_could_be_the_metaverse_with_minimal/|#]] [[https://archive.ph/BBZ8K|#]]%0a%0aPitfalls to watch out for by Belluar [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOORshQJBCs&list=TLPQMTIwNzIwMjI6SxokEYrMaA&index=3|#]] [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBPsMn412ls|#]]%0a%0aDon't fall into the trap of focusing on these metrics [[https://gameanalytics.com/blog/metrics-all-game-developers-should-know/|#]].
