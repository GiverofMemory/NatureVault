csum=Perhaps the truss could include potential for 6 wheels instead of only 4 and the middle pair would be connected to the truss slightly lower to help it get over obstacles. Both the front and rear pair are not powered (in current design) but both turn when steering is turned.  Only the middle wheel set is powered.  So when in "train" configuration trailer trusses could only have the middle wheels.  So each stage of the train could be powered adding more towing ability the more powered stages are added.
