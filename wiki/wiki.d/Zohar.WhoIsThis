text=Who Is This? %0a%0a%0a%0a169. Rabbi Elazar opened and said, "Who is this coming up from the %0awasteland?" (Shir HaShirim, 3:6). MI ZOT— who is this— is the common %0aground of the two questions, the two worlds, Bina and Malchut, which are %0abound together. COMING UP— coming up to become the "Holy of Holies." %0aFor MI is Bina, called the Holy of Holies. And she joins with ZOT (Malchut), %0aso that Malchut could come up FROM THE WASTELAND, for she inherits %0aTHIS from the wasteland, to become a bride and enter the bridal canopy. %0a%0aThe Zohar explains the following passage: "Who is this coming up from the %0awasteland, leaning upon her beloved!?" (Shir HaShirim, 8:5). It describes a state %0aat the end of correction, when the bride enters the wedding canopy. MI ZOT: %0aMI is Bina and ZOT is Malchut. At the end of correction, Bina and Malchut %0aunite, and both are called "holy." But until the end of correction only Bina is %0acalled holy, while Malchut ascends to Bina and receives holiness from her. %0a%0aNevertheless, at the end of correction, Malchut becomes like Bina, and they %0aboth become holy. Malchut completely unites with Bina through equivalence %0aof form, and fully merges with the source of life, for a screen (the restriction %0aimposed on reception of Light within Malchut) creates the Returning Light that %0acombines all Sefirot into one. %0a%0aThe Creator's Ohr Hochma can be received precisely in this Returning Light. %0aAs a result, Malchut ends with the letter Yod and becomes forever similar to Bina. %0aHence, it is written that Malchut and Bina unite by equalizing their desires to %0aform a single whole. %0a%0aSimilarly, the Light of Malchut will be forever connected to the Light of Bina, %0afor Malchut herself ascends to the level of the "Holy of Holies," thus becoming %0aexactly like Bina. SHE COMES UP just like a sacrifice, which is the "Holy of %0aHolies," for MI (AVI, Bina or the "Holy of Holies") joins ZOT (Malchut), so %0a%0a347 %0a%0a%0a%0a348 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aMalchut would ascend and become the "Holy of Holies." Sacrifice is the part of %0aMalchut (man's animal egoism) that ascends with its properties to Bina. %0a%0aAnd when MI (Bina) joins ZOT (Malchut), and ZOT becomes the "Holy of %0aHolies," there is no longer a diminution of Malchut's state, for this diminution %0aoccurred only because of the deterioration of Malchut's properties, when new %0aegoistic desires emerge within her. %0a%0aNow that Malchut has become as holy (altruistic) in her properties as Bina, %0adeath disappears, and the fall of Malchut into her egoistic desires is impossible, %0afor she has been fully corrected and has attained the properties of Bina, which are %0areferred to as holy. Through Malchut's acquisition of these properties, the Upper %0aLight (life) enters her. Malchut emerges from the wasteland (the sensation of %0alife's absence for want of altruistic properties) and enters her wedding canopy. %0a%0aThis occurs thanks to man's efforts, called "those who keep the Torah" %0a(item 124). These efforts are the foremost part of creation, for they create the %0aTorah and bring Malchut to the great Zivug at the end of her correction, to her %0acomplete fulfillment with the Light. This great Zivug on the entire corrected %0aMalchut (including Malchut de Malchut) can be achieved by precisely this sensation %0a(by man) of the spiritual wasteland. %0a%0a170. She comes up from the wasteland of the soft utterance of lips, as it is %0awritten, "And your mouth is comely" (Shir HaShirim, 4:3). This is because %0athe Hebrew word Midbar (desert/wasteland) is derived from Dibur (speech). %0aIt is written of the mighty forces, that these mighty forces strike Egypt with all %0athe plagues of the wasteland, for all that the Creator did to them was not in %0athe wasteland, but in settlements. And the phrase "in the wasteland" means %0a"by the power of speech, of spoken word." This comes up from articulation, %0afrom the mouth (Malchut) as she ascends and comes under the wings of Ima %0a(mother, Bina). Then, through speech, she descends upon the entire holy %0anation (the difference between speech and articulation is that articulation is %0aan action that forms speech). %0a%0aBefore the end of correction, when Malchut is still called the "Tree of Good %0aand Evil," all corrections occur through MAN (prayers or requests), through %0awhich the righteous (those who wish to become similar to the Creator in their %0aproperties) elevate Malchut to Bina. Consequently, Malchut receives Bina's %0aproperties for as long as Malchut remains there, for spiritual ascent signifies an %0aattainment of properties. Malchut becomes as holy (altruistic) as Bina. %0a%0aMAN is a silent prayer in the heart of man, for Malchut signifies "speech." %0aYet, until the end of correction, good words cannot exist without bad ones. That %0a%0a%0a%0aWho Is This? %0a%0a%0a%0a349 %0a%0a%0a%0ais, this will not happen until both voice and speech come from Bina herself, when %0aMalchut becomes like Bina, which designates the unity of voice and speech— the %0aZivug of ZON in their corrected state of Gadlut. %0a%0aZA receives the voice from Ima and passes it in his speech to Malchut. Hence, %0athis speech is completely good, devoid of any evil. Thus, Malchut receives from %0aBina the Light of holiness, Hassadim. Unless it is corrected by the completely %0agood, altruistic voice of Bina, Malchut's voice will always consist of both good %0aand evil. This is why impure, egoistic forces cling to her, and Malchut cannot %0areceive anything from holiness (Bina). %0a%0aHence, MAN that the righteous raise in their prayers is like a soft murmur %0aof lips, a voiceless speech, as the prophet says: "Only the lips move, but the %0avoice cannot be heard" (Shmuel I, 1:13). This is because there is no connection %0abetween MAN and the impure force, and Malchut can be elevated to Bina so she %0acan receive her voice from Bina. %0a%0aAs a result, a holy edifice of Malchut is erected, and she receives the %0aLight from a Zivug between voice and speech, and the holiness of her speech %0adescends upon the heads of the righteous that raised MAN and thereby %0arevived Malchut. %0a%0aThis is why it is written that SHE COMES UP FROM THE WASTELAND, %0afor the bride (Malchut) is now invited to a great Zivug under the wedding canopy. %0aThis occurs thanks to the raising of MAN by the righteous, who thereby united %0aBina (voice, Ima) with Malchut (speech). As a result, Malchut's speech became as %0abeautiful as that of Bina. %0a%0aAll of these individual Zivugim made by the various righteous (each of whom %0aconstitutes a small part of the common Malchut) during the 6,000 years, now %0aconnect all of Malchut 's parts (souls of the righteous) together in one great Zivug, %0aas the bride (Malchut) enters her wedding canopy. %0a%0aIn other words, it is precisely this soft prayer, the raising of MAN during the %0a6,000 years by a voiceless speech (seeing as good is still mixed with evil in the %0avoice of Malchut), that creates the conditions for the great Zivug of Malchut with %0aZA, of man with the Creator. %0a%0aAnd since Malchut received the voice of Bina (from Ima-Mother) thanks %0ato the help of the righteous (all the good deeds performed by the righteous %0aduring the 6,000 years), everything is now combined into the great Supernal %0aZivug under the wedding canopy. This is because Malchut becomes completely %0agood without a hint of evil— the "Holy of Holies," just like Ima. %0a%0a%0a%0a350 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aSilent speech is defined as the movement of lips without the participation of %0athe palate, larynx, tongue, and teeth. This is how MAN is raised when Malchut %0aascends between the wings of Bina, i.e., receives the voice of the wings of Ima %0ain her speech. Afterwards, having acquired the speech, she descends upon the %0aheads of the holy nation. For after the reception of voice through Ima 's property %0aof mercy, Malchut becomes as holy as Bina herself, and her holiness descends %0aupon those who corrected her. Consequently, they are called the "holy nation," %0afor now the speech of Malchut is as holy as that of Ima-Bina. %0a%0aThere is "voice" and there is "speech." "Voice" is the inner part, whereas %0a"speech" is its outward appearance. This appearance is based on exhaling (the %0asilent letter Hey). ZA is called "voice," and Malchut is called "speech." Letters %0aare sung according to the note signs (Taamim), followed by the letters with their %0apunctuation marks. %0a%0aThe level of Ohr Haya (called Kol— voice) emerges on the screen in the Peh of %0athe third degree of thickness, known as "teeth." From this Light ZA receives Ohr %0aHochma, and his voice is then heard outside (begets the souls of the lower ones). %0a%0aYet, the voice of ZA is not heard below the level of Neshama, for his screen is %0anot strong enough to receive Ohr Hochma. The level of Ohr Yechida in ZA, called %0aDibur (speech), emerges on the screen in the Peh of the fourth degree of thickness. %0aThis screen is the most powerful, as it reveals all of the Light, and is called "lips." %0a%0aThe Light of NRNHY reveals the inner, Supernal and concealed wisdom, %0aHochma, the concealed thought, the inner Light of Bina, which cannot shine %0ato the lower ones, that is, in ZA, because ZON cannot receive from Peh de AA. %0aNevertheless, the two levels of the Light— Haya and Yechida— that descend from %0aAA are converted into voice and speech with Bina 's help, even though it is the %0aLight of thought, wisdom and reason. %0a%0aVoice is formed in ZA, and speech in Malchut. If a righteous one raises his %0aprayers (MAN) to Malchut, thereby causing ZON to ascend to AVI, who are in %0aconstant union, to provide Light for the lower ones, ZON receive this Light %0afrom AVI, which is called "voice and speech." The property of the righteous is to %0acreate the pure and destroy the impure with their voice. In the beginning, there %0awas only one language (one speech) in the world, Lashon HaKodesh— the holy %0alanguage. In Hebrew (as in English) the same word (Lashon) means "tongue" %0a(both as a body part and as a means of communication). %0a%0a171. He asks: "How does Malchut ascend in speech?" And he replies: "When %0aman first awakens in the morning and opens his eyes, he must bless his %0aCreator and Master. How is he to bless Him? The way it was done by the first %0a%0a%0a%0aWho Is This? %0a%0a%0a%0a351 %0a%0a%0a%0aHassidimi they would prepare a vessel of water beside them, so that when they %0awoke at night, they would wash their hands at once, and, having blessed the %0aTorah, would rise to study it. When the rooster crowed, precisely heralding %0amidnight, the Creator was with the righteous in the Garden of Eden. And it %0ais forbidden to perform a blessing in the morning with unclean hands." %0a%0aHe asks: since it is written that the beginning of Malchut's correction must %0abe expressed in a quiet murmur of lips, how can he who wakes up (spiritually) %0aimmediately pronounce a blessing at the top of his voice? After all, the blessing %0amust also be uttered in whisper so as to first receive a voice from Ima, and with %0athis voice (by the force of Ima-Bina) elevate Malchut to Bina, and impart onto her %0aaltruistic properties. %0a%0aThe Zohar replies: The first Hassidim have corrected this. As man falls asleep %0a(falls to the level of the Light in his Partzuf called "sleep"), his holy soul (the %0aLight that was in his spiritual Partzuf) ascends, and only the impure spirit of the %0aprimordial serpent (egoistic properties) remains in him, for sleep constitutes the %0a60 th part of death (Talmud, Berachot, 57:2). %0a%0aSince death is an impure property of the primordial serpent, the impure %0aspirit (egoistic desires) does not leave man completely as he wakes up (receives %0aa new Light from Above), but remains on man's fingertips (not all of man's %0adesires change under the influence of the Light received from Above, called %0a"the Light of morning" or "the Light of awakening"). %0a%0aAnd the greater holiness and Light that was present in man before he fell %0aasleep (before he fell into a diminished spiritual state, called "sleep"), the more %0athe impure (egoistic) force clings to these desires when the altruistic intentions %0aexit them during sleep. %0a%0aFingertips constitute the purest place (desires) of the entire body (all desires), %0aman's most spiritual desires, for they can be filled with Ohr Hochma (Ohr Hochma %0aenters these desires during a Zivug, with the help of a screen). Therefore, even %0aafter awakening (at the beginning of the spiritual ascent), the impure (egoistic) %0aforce does not leave this place, wishing to receive at least some of that great %0aLight, which can fill these most altruistic human desires. %0a%0aHence, hands must be washed in order to remove the residual egoistic %0adesires. For this to happen, two vessels need to be prepared: the Upper One %0a(cup) and the lower one that will accept the removed impurity. %0a%0aThe Upper Vessel designates Bina, whose Light drives the impure force away. %0aHence, washing the fingertips with water (the forces or desires of Bina) expels %0athe impure force (man's egoistic desires) from them. Thus, Malchut rids herself %0a%0a%0a%0a352 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aof her evil (egoism) and becomes holy and good. Afterwards, one can study the %0aTorah and bless the Creator for it, for washing hands is similar to raising MAN %0ain a whispered prayer to the wings of Ima. %0a%0aAnd when the rooster crows (this is a special spiritual sign of the angel %0aGavriel), it is precisely midnight, as it is written: "The greater star to rule the day %0aand the lesser star to rule the night" (Beresheet, 1:16). For the lesser star, the holy %0aShechina-Malchut grew smaller, clothed in impure forces and "her feet descend %0ato death" (Mishley, 5:5). %0a%0aThis is so because during the 6,000 years, up to her final correction, %0aMalchut constitutes the Tree (foundations) of Good and Evil: if one is worthy, %0ashe becomes good for him and purifies him, if not— she turns evil. Accordingly, %0athe rule of night is also divided into two parts: the first refers to a state called %0a"unworthy— evil," and the second refers to a state called "worthy— good." %0a%0aThe first correction of Malchut's good part is made exactly at midnight (in a %0astate so called "midnight"), for it is then that Malchut receives the voice of Bina. %0aPut differently, Malchut ascends to Malchut de Ima-Bina and corrects herself %0awithin it. As a result, the strictness and judgment in Malchut become holy and %0agood, completely devoid of evil. This means that strictness and judgment fall %0aonto the impure forces, but for Israel, they turn into mercy. %0a%0aYitzchak signifies restriction, the property of Malchut within Bina. The %0aHebrew word for a "rooster" is Tarnegol, and also Gever (man) and designates %0athe angel Gavriel, who attends to Malchut, the lesser star. The strictness of Bina %0apierces the wings of the rooster (Gavriel), and through it Malchut receives the %0avoice of Bina. %0a%0aAnd when Gavriel passes the voice of Bina to Malchut, his call reaches all %0athe roosters of this world, the property of judgment in the spiritual void. Such %0aa state is called "this world" or Malchut de Malchut. Everyone speaks only in this %0avoice, which was corrected by Bina's property of mercy. %0a%0aTherefore, the voice of Malchut (her judgment) no longer dominates the %0asecond half of the night, and the voice of Bina claims this place. This is what the %0a"rooster of this world" heralds— the property of judgment in Malchut de Malchut. %0a%0aHence, a rooster's crow (change of properties) is heard precisely at midnight %0a(when states change), for this crow means that Malchut has already been corrected %0aby the voice of Bina, and that this voice is already within Malchut. This is defined %0aas the moment of midnight, which marks the beginning of the second half- %0aabsolute goodness, devoid of evil. %0a%0a%0a%0aWho Is This? %0a%0a%0a%0a353 %0a%0a%0a%0aAfter Malchut receives the voice of Bina, the righteous (man's properties in %0athe worlds of BYA) raise MAN with the help of their study of To rah after (in the %0astate of) midnight. They keep raising MAN to the "cheerful strictness" in Ima, of %0awhich it is written: "She rises also while it is yet night" (Mishley, 31:15), for it is %0aprecisely at night that the Supernal Malchut reveals herself in all her splendor. %0a%0aAnd the actual revelation of Malchut takes place in the Garden of Eden, i.e., %0ashe is meant for those righteous who have corrected her with their work and %0astudies (in the state) after midnight. The Creator rejoices with them (merriment %0asignifies fulfillment with Ohr Hochma) in the Garden of Eden, for the corrected %0aMalchut is called "the Holy Shechina" or "the Garden of Eden," for she receives %0aHochma and rejoices with the righteous that constitute MAN within her. %0a%0aAnd the phrase that describes how impurity (egoistic desires) is washed away %0a(corrected to altruistic properties) from man's fingers (his most exalted desires) %0ais true not only with regard to nighttime. Man ascends from the lower degree %0aof "sleep" onto a higher degree of "awakening," the difference between the two %0astates being that previously, he was receiving only the vital Ohr Hassadim, called %0a"sleep," while "awakening" signifies reception of Ohr Hochma. This is because %0athe impure force constantly clings to man's fingertips (precisely for man to %0acorrect it and thus attain greater spiritual heights), and he is obliged to wash his %0ahands (make his desires and intentions "for the Creator's sake") before uttering %0aa blessing (appealing to the Creator for reception). %0a%0a172. For when man is asleep, his soul (spirit) leaves him. And as soon as his soul %0adeparts from him, the impure spirit replaces it at once, and it fills his hands %0aand defiles them, and it is forbidden to utter a blessing without washing one's %0ahands. And should you object that when man is awake and his soul does not %0aleave him, the impure force does not descend upon him, then, if he enters a %0awashroom, he is forbidden from reading even a single word of the Torah until %0ahe washes his hands. And if you say that it is because his hands are soiled, this %0ais not true, for how are they soiled? %0a%0a173. But woe unto those who do not beware and do not guard the Creator's %0ahonor and do not know the foundation of this world. There is a certain spirit %0athat dwells in every cesspool of the world, a spirit that relishes depravity and %0aexcrement, and it immediately settles on the fingers of man's hands. %0a%0aJust like Rabbi Y. Ashlag, I refrain from commenting on items 172 and 173 %0aof The Zohar, and he who merits it— will understand this text himself.

MI ZOT— who is this— is the common %0a%3c ground of the two questions, the two worlds, Bina and Malchut, which are %0a%3c bound together. COMING UP— coming up to become the "Holy of Holies." %0a%3c For MI is Bina, called the Holy of Holies. And she joins with ZOT (Malchut), %0a%3c so that Malchut could come up FROM THE WASTELAND, for she inherits %0a%3c THIS from the wasteland, to become a bride and enter the bridal canopy. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar explains the following passage: "Who is this coming up from the %0a%3c wasteland, leaning upon her beloved!?" (Shir HaShirim, 8:5). It describes a state %0a%3c at the end of correction, when the bride enters the wedding canopy. MI ZOT: %0a%3c MI is Bina and ZOT is Malchut. At the end of correction, Bina and Malchut %0a%3c unite, and both are called "holy." But until the end of correction only Bina is %0a%3c called holy, while Malchut ascends to Bina and receives holiness from her. %0a%3c %0a%3c Nevertheless, at the end of correction, Malchut becomes like Bina, and they %0a%3c both become holy. Malchut completely unites with Bina through equivalence %0a%3c of form, and fully merges with the source of life, for a screen (the restriction %0a%3c imposed on reception of Light within Malchut) creates the Returning Light that %0a%3c combines all Sefirot into one. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Creator's Ohr Hochma can be received precisely in this Returning Light. %0a%3c As a result, Malchut ends with the letter Yod and becomes forever similar to Bina. %0a%3c Hence, it is written that Malchut and Bina unite by equalizing their desires to %0a%3c form a single whole. %0a%3c %0a%3c Similarly, the Light of Malchut will be forever connected to the Light of Bina, %0a%3c for Malchut herself ascends to the level of the "Holy of Holies," thus becoming %0a%3c exactly like Bina. SHE COMES UP just like a sacrifice, which is the "Holy of %0a%3c Holies," for MI (AVI, Bina or the "Holy of Holies") joins ZOT (Malchut), so %0a%3c %0a%3c 347 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 348 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut would ascend and become the "Holy of Holies." Sacrifice is the part of %0a%3c Malchut (man's animal egoism) that ascends with its properties to Bina. %0a%3c %0a%3c And when MI (Bina) joins ZOT (Malchut), and ZOT becomes the "Holy of %0a%3c Holies," there is no longer a diminution of Malchut's state, for this diminution %0a%3c occurred only because of the deterioration of Malchut's properties, when new %0a%3c egoistic desires emerge within her. %0a%3c %0a%3c Now that Malchut has become as holy (altruistic) in her properties as Bina, %0a%3c death disappears, and the fall of Malchut into her egoistic desires is impossible, %0a%3c for she has been fully corrected and has attained the properties of Bina, which are %0a%3c referred to as holy. Through Malchut's acquisition of these properties, the Upper %0a%3c Light (life) enters her. Malchut emerges from the wasteland (the sensation of %0a%3c life's absence for want of altruistic properties) and enters her wedding canopy. %0a%3c %0a%3c This occurs thanks to man's efforts, called "those who keep the Torah" %0a%3c (item 124). These efforts are the foremost part of creation, for they create the %0a%3c Torah and bring Malchut to the great Zivug at the end of her correction, to her %0a%3c complete fulfillment with the Light. This great Zivug on the entire corrected %0a%3c Malchut (including Malchut de Malchut) can be achieved by precisely this sensation %0a%3c (by man) of the spiritual wasteland. %0a%3c %0a%3c 170. She comes up from the wasteland of the soft utterance of lips, as it is %0a%3c written, "And your mouth is comely" (Shir HaShirim, 4:3). This is because %0a%3c the Hebrew word Midbar (desert/wasteland) is derived from Dibur (speech). %0a%3c It is written of the mighty forces, that these mighty forces strike Egypt with all %0a%3c the plagues of the wasteland, for all that the Creator did to them was not in %0a%3c the wasteland, but in settlements. And the phrase "in the wasteland" means %0a%3c "by the power of speech, of spoken word." This comes up from articulation, %0a%3c from the mouth (Malchut) as she ascends and comes under the wings of Ima %0a%3c (mother, Bina). Then, through speech, she descends upon the entire holy %0a%3c nation (the difference between speech and articulation is that articulation is %0a%3c an action that forms speech). %0a%3c %0a%3c Before the end of correction, when Malchut is still called the "Tree of Good %0a%3c and Evil," all corrections occur through MAN (prayers or requests), through %0a%3c which the righteous (those who wish to become similar to the Creator in their %0a%3c properties) elevate Malchut to Bina. Consequently, Malchut receives Bina's %0a%3c properties for as long as Malchut remains there, for spiritual ascent signifies an %0a%3c attainment of properties. Malchut becomes as holy (altruistic) as Bina. %0a%3c %0a%3c MAN is a silent prayer in the heart of man, for Malchut signifies "speech." %0a%3c Yet, until the end of correction, good words cannot exist without bad ones. That %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Who Is This? %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 349 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c is, this will not happen until both voice and speech come from Bina herself, when %0a%3c Malchut becomes like Bina, which designates the unity of voice and speech— the %0a%3c Zivug of ZON in their corrected state of Gadlut. %0a%3c %0a%3c ZA receives the voice from Ima and passes it in his speech to Malchut. Hence, %0a%3c this speech is completely good, devoid of any evil. Thus, Malchut receives from %0a%3c Bina the Light of holiness, Hassadim. Unless it is corrected by the completely %0a%3c good, altruistic voice of Bina, Malchut's voice will always consist of both good %0a%3c and evil. This is why impure, egoistic forces cling to her, and Malchut cannot %0a%3c receive anything from holiness (Bina). %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, MAN that the righteous raise in their prayers is like a soft murmur %0a%3c of lips, a voiceless speech, as the prophet says: "Only the lips move, but the %0a%3c voice cannot be heard" (Shmuel I, 1:13). This is because there is no connection %0a%3c between MAN and the impure force, and Malchut can be elevated to Bina so she %0a%3c can receive her voice from Bina. %0a%3c %0a%3c As a result, a holy edifice of Malchut is erected, and she receives the %0a%3c Light from a Zivug between voice and speech, and the holiness of her speech %0a%3c descends upon the heads of the righteous that raised MAN and thereby %0a%3c revived Malchut. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is why it is written that SHE COMES UP FROM THE WASTELAND, %0a%3c for the bride (Malchut) is now invited to a great Zivug under the wedding canopy. %0a%3c This occurs thanks to the raising of MAN by the righteous, who thereby united %0a%3c Bina (voice, Ima) with Malchut (speech). As a result, Malchut's speech became as %0a%3c beautiful as that of Bina. %0a%3c %0a%3c All of these individual Zivugim made by the various righteous (each of whom %0a%3c constitutes a small part of the common Malchut) during the 6,000 years, now %0a%3c connect all of Malchut 's parts (souls of the righteous) together in one great Zivug, %0a%3c as the bride (Malchut) enters her wedding canopy. %0a%3c %0a%3c In other words, it is precisely this soft prayer, the raising of MAN during the %0a%3c 6,000 years by a voiceless speech (seeing as good is still mixed with evil in the %0a%3c voice of Malchut), that creates the conditions for the great Zivug of Malchut with %0a%3c ZA, of man with the Creator. %0a%3c %0a%3c And since Malchut received the voice of Bina (from Ima-Mother) thanks %0a%3c to the help of the righteous (all the good deeds performed by the righteous %0a%3c during the 6,000 years), everything is now combined into the great Supernal %0a%3c Zivug under the wedding canopy. This is because Malchut becomes completely %0a%3c good without a hint of evil— the "Holy of Holies," just like Ima. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 350 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Silent speech is defined as the movement of lips without the participation of %0a%3c the palate, larynx, tongue, and teeth. This is how MAN is raised when Malchut %0a%3c ascends between the wings of Bina, i.e., receives the voice of the wings of Ima %0a%3c in her speech. Afterwards, having acquired the speech, she descends upon the %0a%3c heads of the holy nation. For after the reception of voice through Ima 's property %0a%3c of mercy, Malchut becomes as holy as Bina herself, and her holiness descends %0a%3c upon those who corrected her. Consequently, they are called the "holy nation," %0a%3c for now the speech of Malchut is as holy as that of Ima-Bina. %0a%3c %0a%3c There is "voice" and there is "speech." "Voice" is the inner part, whereas %0a%3c "speech" is its outward appearance. This appearance is based on exhaling (the %0a%3c silent letter Hey). ZA is called "voice," and Malchut is called "speech." Letters %0a%3c are sung according to the note signs (Taamim), followed by the letters with their %0a%3c punctuation marks. %0a%3c %0a%3c The level of Ohr Haya (called Kol— voice) emerges on the screen in the Peh of %0a%3c the third degree of thickness, known as "teeth." From this Light ZA receives Ohr %0a%3c Hochma, and his voice is then heard outside (begets the souls of the lower ones). %0a%3c %0a%3c Yet, the voice of ZA is not heard below the level of Neshama, for his screen is %0a%3c not strong enough to receive Ohr Hochma. The level of Ohr Yechida in ZA, called %0a%3c Dibur (speech), emerges on the screen in the Peh of the fourth degree of thickness. %0a%3c This screen is the most powerful, as it reveals all of the Light, and is called "lips." %0a%3c %0a%3c The Light of NRNHY reveals the inner, Supernal and concealed wisdom, %0a%3c Hochma, the concealed thought, the inner Light of Bina, which cannot shine %0a%3c to the lower ones, that is, in ZA, because ZON cannot receive from Peh de AA. %0a%3c Nevertheless, the two levels of the Light— Haya and Yechida— that descend from %0a%3c AA are converted into voice and speech with Bina 's help, even though it is the %0a%3c Light of thought, wisdom and reason. %0a%3c %0a%3c Voice is formed in ZA, and speech in Malchut. If a righteous one raises his %0a%3c prayers (MAN) to Malchut, thereby causing ZON to ascend to AVI, who are in %0a%3c constant union, to provide Light for the lower ones, ZON receive this Light %0a%3c from AVI, which is called "voice and speech." The property of the righteous is to %0a%3c create the pure and destroy the impure with their voice. In the beginning, there %0a%3c was only one language (one speech) in the world, Lashon HaKodesh— the holy %0a%3c language. In Hebrew (as in English) the same word (Lashon) means "tongue" %0a%3c (both as a body part and as a means of communication). %0a%3c %0a%3c 171. He asks: "How does Malchut ascend in speech?" And he replies: "When %0a%3c man first awakens in the morning and opens his eyes, he must bless his %0a%3c Creator and Master. How is he to bless Him? The way it was done by the first %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Who Is This? %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 351 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Hassidimi they would prepare a vessel of water beside them, so that when they %0a%3c woke at night, they would wash their hands at once, and, having blessed the %0a%3c Torah, would rise to study it. When the rooster crowed, precisely heralding %0a%3c midnight, the Creator was with the righteous in the Garden of Eden. And it %0a%3c is forbidden to perform a blessing in the morning with unclean hands." %0a%3c %0a%3c He asks: since it is written that the beginning of Malchut's correction must %0a%3c be expressed in a quiet murmur of lips, how can he who wakes up (spiritually) %0a%3c immediately pronounce a blessing at the top of his voice? After all, the blessing %0a%3c must also be uttered in whisper so as to first receive a voice from Ima, and with %0a%3c this voice (by the force of Ima-Bina) elevate Malchut to Bina, and impart onto her %0a%3c altruistic properties. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar replies: The first Hassidim have corrected this. As man falls asleep %0a%3c (falls to the level of the Light in his Partzuf called "sleep"), his holy soul (the %0a%3c Light that was in his spiritual Partzuf) ascends, and only the impure spirit of the %0a%3c primordial serpent (egoistic properties) remains in him, for sleep constitutes the %0a%3c 60 th part of death (Talmud, Berachot, 57:2). %0a%3c %0a%3c Since death is an impure property of the primordial serpent, the impure %0a%3c spirit (egoistic desires) does not leave man completely as he wakes up (receives %0a%3c a new Light from Above), but remains on man's fingertips (not all of man's %0a%3c desires change under the influence of the Light received from Above, called %0a%3c "the Light of morning" or "the Light of awakening"). %0a%3c %0a%3c And the greater holiness and Light that was present in man before he fell %0a%3c asleep (before he fell into a diminished spiritual state, called "sleep"), the more %0a%3c the impure (egoistic) force clings to these desires when the altruistic intentions %0a%3c exit them during sleep. %0a%3c %0a%3c Fingertips constitute the purest place (desires) of the entire body (all desires), %0a%3c man's most spiritual desires, for they can be filled with Ohr Hochma (Ohr Hochma %0a%3c enters these desires during a Zivug, with the help of a screen). Therefore, even %0a%3c after awakening (at the beginning of the spiritual ascent), the impure (egoistic) %0a%3c force does not leave this place, wishing to receive at least some of that great %0a%3c Light, which can fill these most altruistic human desires. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, hands must be washed in order to remove the residual egoistic %0a%3c desires. For this to happen, two vessels need to be prepared: the Upper One %0a%3c (cup) and the lower one that will accept the removed impurity. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Upper Vessel designates Bina, whose Light drives the impure force away. %0a%3c Hence, washing the fingertips with water (the forces or desires of Bina) expels %0a%3c the impure force (man's egoistic desires) from them. Thus, Malchut rids herself %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 352 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c of her evil (egoism) and becomes holy and good. Afterwards, one can study the %0a%3c Torah and bless the Creator for it, for washing hands is similar to raising MAN %0a%3c in a whispered prayer to the wings of Ima. %0a%3c %0a%3c And when the rooster crows (this is a special spiritual sign of the angel %0a%3c Gavriel), it is precisely midnight, as it is written: "The greater star to rule the day %0a%3c and the lesser star to rule the night" (Beresheet, 1:16). For the lesser star, the holy %0a%3c Shechina-Malchut grew smaller, clothed in impure forces and "her feet descend %0a%3c to death" (Mishley, 5:5). %0a%3c %0a%3c This is so because during the 6,000 years, up to her final correction, %0a%3c Malchut constitutes the Tree (foundations) of Good and Evil: if one is worthy, %0a%3c she becomes good for him and purifies him, if not— she turns evil. Accordingly, %0a%3c the rule of night is also divided into two parts: the first refers to a state called %0a%3c "unworthy— evil," and the second refers to a state called "worthy— good." %0a%3c %0a%3c The first correction of Malchut's good part is made exactly at midnight (in a %0a%3c state so called "midnight"), for it is then that Malchut receives the voice of Bina. %0a%3c Put differently, Malchut ascends to Malchut de Ima-Bina and corrects herself %0a%3c within it. As a result, the strictness and judgment in Malchut become holy and %0a%3c good, completely devoid of evil. This means that strictness and judgment fall %0a%3c onto the impure forces, but for Israel, they turn into mercy. %0a%3c %0a%3c Yitzchak signifies restriction, the property of Malchut within Bina. The %0a%3c Hebrew word for a "rooster" is Tarnegol, and also Gever (man) and designates %0a%3c the angel Gavriel, who attends to Malchut, the lesser star. The strictness of Bina %0a%3c pierces the wings of the rooster (Gavriel), and through it Malchut receives the %0a%3c voice of Bina. %0a%3c %0a%3c And when Gavriel passes the voice of Bina to Malchut, his call reaches all %0a%3c the roosters of this world, the property of judgment in the spiritual void. Such %0a%3c a state is called "this world" or Malchut de Malchut. Everyone speaks only in this %0a%3c voice, which was corrected by Bina's property of mercy. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, the voice of Malchut (her judgment) no longer dominates the %0a%3c second half of the night, and the voice of Bina claims this place. This is what the %0a%3c "rooster of this world" heralds— the property of judgment in Malchut de Malchut. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, a rooster's crow (change of properties) is heard precisely at midnight %0a%3c (when states change), for this crow means that Malchut has already been corrected %0a%3c by the voice of Bina, and that this voice is already within Malchut. This is defined %0a%3c as the moment of midnight, which marks the beginning of the second half- %0a%3c absolute goodness, devoid of evil. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Who Is This? %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 353 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c After Malchut receives the voice of Bina, the righteous (man's properties in %0a%3c the worlds of BYA) raise MAN with the help of their study of To rah after (in the %0a%3c state of) midnight. They keep raising MAN to the "cheerful strictness" in Ima, of %0a%3c which it is written: "She rises also while it is yet night" (Mishley, 31:15), for it is %0a%3c precisely at night that the Supernal Malchut reveals herself in all her splendor. %0a%3c %0a%3c And the actual revelation of Malchut takes place in the Garden of Eden, i.e., %0a%3c she is meant for those righteous who have corrected her with their work and %0a%3c studies (in the state) after midnight. The Creator rejoices with them (merriment %0a%3c signifies fulfillment with Ohr Hochma) in the Garden of Eden, for the corrected %0a%3c Malchut is called "the Holy Shechina" or "the Garden of Eden," for she receives %0a%3c Hochma and rejoices with the righteous that constitute MAN within her. %0a%3c %0a%3c And the phrase that describes how impurity (egoistic desires) is washed away %0a%3c (corrected to altruistic properties) from man's fingers (his most exalted desires) %0a%3c is true not only with regard to nighttime. Man ascends from the lower degree %0a%3c of "sleep" onto a higher degree of "awakening," the difference between the two %0a%3c states being that previously, he was receiving only the vital Ohr Hassadim, called %0a%3c "sleep," while "awakening" signifies reception of Ohr Hochma. This is because %0a%3c the impure force constantly clings to man's fingertips (precisely for man to %0a%3c correct it and thus attain greater spiritual heights), and he is obliged to wash his %0a%3c hands (make his desires and intentions "for the Creator's sake") before uttering %0a%3c a blessing (appealing to the Creator for reception). %0a%3c %0a%3c 172. For when man is asleep, his soul (spirit) leaves him. And as soon as his soul %0a%3c departs from him, the impure spirit replaces it at once, and it fills his hands %0a%3c and defiles them, and it is forbidden to utter a blessing without washing one's %0a%3c hands. And should you object that when man is awake and his soul does not %0a%3c leave him, the impure force does not descend upon him, then, if he enters a %0a%3c washroom, he is forbidden from reading even a single word of the Torah until %0a%3c he washes his hands. And if you say that it is because his hands are soiled, this %0a%3c is not true, for how are they soiled? %0a%3c %0a%3c 173. But woe unto those who do not beware and do not guard the Creator's %0a%3c honor and do not know the foundation of this world. There is a certain spirit %0a%3c that dwells in every cesspool of the world, a spirit that relishes depravity and %0a%3c excrement, and it immediately settles on the fingers of man's hands. %0a%3c %0a%3c Just like Rabbi Y. Ashlag, I refrain from commenting on items 172 and 173 %0a%3c of The Zohar, and he who merits it— will understand this text himself.%0a\ No newline at end of file%0a
