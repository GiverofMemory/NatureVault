Reasoning for this is brucella causes a severe increaze in [[hepcidin]] while at the same time feeding off macrophage iron which is elevated during high hepcidin.  To respond to the bacteria it would be idea to "shut down" HFE expression so the brucella cannot stimulate hepcidin release.%0a%3c %0a%3c So treating for brucella might attack the root cause of the HFE mutation in [[hemochromatosis]].%0a\ No newline at end of file%0a
