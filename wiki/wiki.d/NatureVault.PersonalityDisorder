csum= The heroes journey, the one, etc are tropes that are narcissistic and harmful.  Our society rewards each person thinking they are the savior, the hero, the one.  This creates a narcissistic divide in personal relationships and is likely done by intelligence agencies like [[CIA]] [[FBI]], etc to control and slit up the families and relationships.  You cannot have teamwork if you are the most important.

When they find, they'll be disturbed. When they're disturbed, they'll be […] amazed, and reign over the All."%0a%0a"When you know yourselves, then you'll be known, and you'll realize that you're the children of the living Father. But if you don't know yourselves, then you live in poverty, and you are the poverty."%0a%0a- [[NatureVault/Gospel of thomas]]%0a%0aPersonality disorders are often thought of as a tree.  To me this reminds me of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil from the [[bible]].  And this is a useful analogy because personality disorders spread like a virus, a social virus if you will, because they spread from person to person by practicing [[NatureVault/evil]] deeds.  These personality disorders are behavioral patterns that emerge due to evil being done to you in life.  Which one you end up developing is based on your own (unique) biology in response to an evil done to you.  This biology may have to do with whether you have [[NatureVault/Serotonin]] or [[NatureVault/dopamine]] predominate, your [[NatureVault/personality]] type, or the ratio of your sex hormones to their respective receptors.  I also think that [[NatureVault/prion]]s play a perhaps large role.%0a%0aYou developed this disorder because you have been wronged.  And you did it to teach them a lesson.  And you probably did.  But at what cost?  The cost is the evil continues spreading throughout the world.%0a%0aIf I had to hazard a guess (and you know I do) I would say cluster A (mad, like crazy) might be when you have serotonin too high, cluster B (bad, as in "he's a bad boy") from having testosterone too high, and cluster C (sad, as in depressed) from having estrogen too high.%0a%0aPersonality disorders linked to personality types [[https://www.typologycentral.com/threads/personality-disorders-and-mbti.57324/post-1926595|#]] [[https://www.typologycentral.com/threads/personality-disorders-and-mbti.57324/post-1919020|#]]%0a%0a!!Cluster B%0aCharacterized by being chaotic [[https://pesqueda.medium.com/the-mad-the-bad-and-the-sad-2d6376107406|#]]%0a!!!Borderline [[#borderline]]%0a%0a"You'll be sorry when I'm gone" - Adam's Song Blink 182%0a%0aUsed to be called borderline psychotic [[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20425279/|#]]%0a%0aMay be on the same spectrum as [[#narcissism|narcissism]]%0aProbably the cause of "[[thin skin]]" [[https://youtu.be/to5qRLRSS7g?t=1115|#]] overreactivity of the mind%0a%0aBorderline personality disorder affects 1 in 16 people [[https://www.bridgestorecovery.com/borderline-personality-disorder/common-borderline-personality-disorder/|#]] and the scary part is there are 16 personality types... also it has been said around 3%25 of the population have BPD, and 3%25 are INTP's...%0a%0a[[Haloperidol]] which is also used for [[Alzheimers]] and called Vitamin H [[http://www.zarcrom.com/users/alzheimers/me4a.html|#]] may help.

[[EPA]] also thought to treat [[https://www.webmd.com/vitamins/ai/ingredientmono-994/eicosapentaenoic-acid-epa|#]].  Risperidone also is used [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risperidone|#]] and is a similar molecule.  However both of these drugs contain [[Fluorine]] and are very dangerous and natural alternatives are needed.%0a[@Robyn%0a2 months ago%0aMichel Essiambre  most of my meds failed, the only one that really helped ~my~ bpd was Haldol, it’s an antipsychotic. When I was on meds it was just to help curb my depression for the time being so we could focus on dbt and other therapy techniques. I’ve heard from other that meds help TONS and other who say the meds only made it worse. I find Effexor worked well with managing my co-occurring  depression. (home grown bud has helped the most)@]%0a%0a[[DBT]] dialectical behavioral therapy works for many.%0a%0aPossibly related to [[ADHD]]%0a%0aMy thought is perhaps too must [[testosterone]] for the amount of testosterone receptors you have could be a cause, which would make sense why women more likely to have it.  Also might relate to [[bisexual]] [[transgender]] [[homosexual]] tendencies.%0a%0aIf it is linked to alzheimers, then [[dandelion]] root might help.  And also could be caused by [[prion]], and if so, perhaps other prion like problems like chronic [[insomnia]], which is actually true they have sleep disturbances [[https://youtu.be/fZM8KMLFQm8|#]] but this could also point to [[toxoplasma]] [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5894504/|#]] possibly instead of or addition to prions.%0a%0aFor me the biggest trigger is a dismissive attitude to my theories as an INTP.%0a%0aTrying to fix things you have no control over [[https://www.yahoo.com/now/borderline-personality-disorder-makes-blame-155001986.html|#]]%0a%0aI suspect the impulsiveness can manifest as taking shortcuts mentally and physically.  Shortcuts in disagreements can lead to outbursts.  You are always looking for an easier way which might make you make mistakes if the supposed easier way turns out to be exponentially harder in practice, or it can tend to just not work.  They say that people with bpd have like a hole in their psyche that when you fill it up it spills out [[https://youtu.be/to5qRLRSS7g?t=1000|#]].  Since they never have a lot of mental juice, they take mental shortcuts.
