text=Rabbi Shimon's Departure from the Cave %0a%0a%0a%0a185. Rabbi Pinchas stood before Rabbi Rachuma on the shore of Lake %0aKinneret. He was wise, old, and almost blind. He said to Rabbi Pinchas: "1 %0ahave heard that our friend Shimon Bar-Yochai has a jewel, a son. I have looked %0aupon the Light from that jewel, and it shines like the light of the sun, and %0ailluminates the entire world." %0a%0aA fully corrected Malchut is called a jewel (usually a pearl). Rabbi Nachum %0atells Rabbi Pinchas that Rabbi Shimon has already merited complete correction, %0afor a "son" designates the next state, the next Partzuf that emerges or is born %0afrom the preceding one. And Rabbi Pinchas sees this while looking (with his %0aspiritual sight, called Ruach HaKodesh—the Holy Spirit) at the Light of this pearl, %0awhich shines like the sun emerging from its hiding (Nartik— sheath). This means %0athat after the future correction of Malchut (the moon), her Light will become %0alike that of the sun, and will illuminate the entire world. %0a%0aAnd when the Light of the moon becomes like that of the sun, it will rise to %0athe zenith and illuminate the whole world with a pillar of Light, from Heaven %0ato earth. And it will shine until Rabbi Shimon completes the correction of Ati/c. %0aThis speaks to the fact that he has already merited attaining the degrees of the %0aCreator's two revelations, i.e., the end of correction. %0a%0a186. And that Light extends from the Heavens down to the earth and %0ailluminates the whole world until Atik-Keter appears and sits upon its throne, %0awhich occurs at the end of correction. And that Light abides entirely in your %0ahousehold (for the daughter of Rabbi Pinchas was wife to Rabbi Shimon, and %0aRabbi Elazar was therefore his grandson). And a tiny ray of Light (called "the %0ason of the household," Rabbi Elazar) separates from the Light that fills the %0ahousehold, comes forth and shines upon the whole world. Happy are those %0a%0a375 %0a%0a%0a%0a376 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0awho merit such a destiny! Come out, my son, come out! Go after that jewel, %0awhich illuminates the world, for it is a good time to do so! %0a%0aSince the daughter of Rabbi Pinchas was the wife of Rabbi Shimon (Rabbi %0aShimon and his wife designate two spiritual Partzufim that are below Rabbi %0aPinchas), Rabbi Shimon (together with his wife) belonged to the household %0a(was included in the Partzuf) of Rabbi Pinchas. This refers to Rabbi Elazar, the %0aPartzuf that emerged from the Light and illuminated the world, which filled %0athe household (ten Sefirot) of Rabbi Pinchas, i.e., came out of the Partzuf called %0a"Rabbi Shimon and his wife." %0a%0a187. He came out before him and stood waiting to board a ship. Two women %0awere with him. He saw two birds soaring over the water. He raised his voice %0aand said, "Birds, you soar over the sea; have you seen the place where one %0acould find Bar-Yochai?" He waited some and said, "Birds, O birds, fly away." %0aThey flew away and disappeared into the sea. %0a%0aRabbi Shimon fled from the authorities that condemned him to death, and %0ahid in a cave with his son. And no one knew where he was. Therefore, Rabbi %0aPinchas set out to look for him. %0a%0aAlthough everything described here is historically true, it is nonetheless %0aessential for us to understand the words of The Zohar as the actions of Supernal %0aspiritual causes, whose consequences determine all that transpires on earth. %0aThe egoistic authorities (forces) of a Partzuf as exalted as Rabbi Shimon's try %0ato overcome his own altruistic aspirations and deprive him of the Light, that %0ais, to kill him. And he hides from them in a cave, i.e., assumes a small state %0a(Katnut) and shines with the Light of Mercy. This is referred to as "hides in %0aa cave"— becomes invisible to egoistic forces, for they desire Ohr Hochma and %0acannot see Ohr Hassadim. %0a%0a188. Before he boarded the ship, the birds approached again, and in the beak %0aof one of them was a letter. It read that Rabbi Shimon, the son of Yochai, had %0aleft the cave together with his son, Rabbi Elazar. Rabbi Pinchas went to them %0aand found them completely changed: their bodies were covered with sores %0a(like holes in the ground— see the Talmud, Bava Batra, 19:2) from staying in %0athe cave for so long. He wept and said, "Woe that I have seen you so!" Rabbi %0aShimon replied: "O how happy is my lot that you have seen me so, for had %0ayou not seen me so, I would not have been what I am!" Rabbi Shimon opened %0aabout the Mitzvot of the Torah and said, "The Mitzvot of the Torah that the %0aCreator gave to Israel are all described in a general form." %0a%0a%0a%0aRabbi Shimon's Departure from the Cave %0a%0a%0a%0a377 %0a%0a%0a%0aWhile staying in the cave (in Ohr Hassadim) for many years (degrees), Rabbi %0aShimon had no choice but to sit in the sand (the external garment— Levush %0acovering the Partzuf with a particular property, called "earth") in order to cover %0ahis naked body (desires) so he could study the Torah (receive the Upper Light in %0ahis Partzuf with the intention for the Creator's sake). As a result of being covered %0awith sand, his entire "body" was covered with "rust and sores" (but these were %0anecessary corrections). %0a%0aAnd not only did the Partzuf called Rabbi Shimon need the correction of %0aconcealment in Hassadim (cave) and the cover of an external garment (Returning %0aLight), but his next state, fathered by him, called his son, Rabbi Elazar (a lower %0aPartzuf), also needed these corrections to attain all of the Creator's Light. %0a%0aHe wept and said: "Woe that I have seen you so!" Rabbi Shimon replied: %0a"O how happy is my lot that you have seen me so, for had you not seen me so, %0aI would not have been what I am!" In other words, if I would not look as I do, I %0awould not have merited all the secrets of the Torah, for all that I have attained, %0aI have attained during those thirteen years (thirteen successive corrections) of %0ahiding in the cave. %0a%0aRabbi Shimon opened. It is written of the Mitzvot of the Torah: "The Mit^ot %0aof the Torah that the Creator gave to Israel are all described in a general form." %0aAll of the Mitzvot of the Torah are described in the passage from the Torah, %0astarting with "In the beginning the Creator created" and ending with "Let there %0abe Light." These are the Mitzvot of fear and punishment, which include all the %0aMitzvot of the Torah. This is why they are called "in general."
