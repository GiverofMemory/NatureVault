csum=Some pain in liver/gallbladder.  Could be herb toxicity or just gram negative bacteria.  Try boosting mustard maybe adding food grade [[diatomaceous earth]] or [[activated charcoal]].  Also possibly liver support herbs like [[milk thistle]].  Tobe honest it is on and off like parasite movement.  Heart also gets this feeling to but much less often.  Perhaps boosting antioxidants like [[eye treatment#visishield]] herbs.
