We all want to know why we are here, why there is pain, and how %0awe can make life more enjoyable. The four parts of this book provide us with %0areliable answers to these questions, as well as clear explanations of the gist of %0aKabbalah and its practical implementations. %0a%0a507 %0a%0a%0a%0a508 %0a%0a%0a%0aAppendix One %0a%0a%0a%0aPart One discusses the discovery of the wisdom of Kabbalah, and how it was %0adeveloped, and finally concealed until our time. Part Two introduces the gist %0aof the wisdom of Kabbalah, using ten easy drawings to help us understand the %0astructure of the spiritual worlds, and how they relate to our world. Part Three %0areveals Kabbalistic concepts that are largely unknown to the public, and Part %0aFour elaborates on practical means you and I can take, to make our lives better %0aand more enjoyable for us and for our children. %0a%0aKabbalah Revealed %0a%0aThis is a clearly written, reader-friendly guide to making sense of the surrounding %0aworld. Each of its six chapters focuses on a different aspect of the wisdom of %0aKabbalah, illuminating the teachings and explaining them using various %0aexamples from our day-to-day lives. %0a%0aThe first three chapters in Kabbalah Revealed explain why the world is in a %0astate of crisis, how our growing desires promote progress as well as alienation, %0aand why the biggest deterrent to achieving positive change is rooted in our own %0aspirits. Chapters Four through Six offer a prescription for positive change. In %0athese chapters, we learn how we can use our spirits to build a personally peaceful %0alife in harmony with all of Creation. %0a%0aWondrous Wisdom %0a%0aThis book offers an initial course on Kabbalah. Like all the books presented %0ahere, Wondrous Wisdom is based solely on authentic teachings passed down %0afrom Kabbalist teacher to student over thousands of years. At the heart of the %0abook is a sequence of lessons revealing the nature of Kabbalah's wisdom and %0aexplaining how to attain it. For every person questioning "Who am I really?" %0aand "Why am I on this planet?" this book is a must. %0a%0aAwakening to Kabbalah %0a%0aA distinctive, personal, and awe-filled introduction to an ancient wisdom %0atradition. In this book, Rav Laitman offers a deeper understanding of the %0afundamental teachings of Kabbalah, and how you can use its wisdom to clarify %0ayour relationship with others and the world around you. %0a%0aUsing language both scientific and poetic, he probes the most profound ques- %0ations of spirituality and existence. This provocative, unique guide will inspire and %0ainvigorate you to see beyond the world as it is and the limitations of your every- %0aday life, become closer to the Creator, and reach new depths of the soul. %0a%0a%0a%0aFurther Reading %0a%0a%0a%0a509 %0a%0a%0a%0aKabbalah, Science, and the Meaning of Life %0a%0aScience explains the mechanisms that sustain life; Kabbalah explains why life %0aexists. In Kabbalah, Science, and the Meaning of Life, Rav Laitman combines %0ascience and spirituality in a captivating dialogue that reveals life's meaning. %0a%0aFor thousands of years Kabbalists have been writing that the world is a single %0aentity divided into separate beings. Today the cutting-edge science of quantum %0aphysics states a very similar idea: that at the most fundamental level of matter, %0awe are all literally one. %0a%0aScience proves that reality is affected by the observer who examines it; and %0aso does Kabbalah. But Kabbalah makes an even bolder statement: even the %0aCreator, the Maker of reality, is within the observer. In other words, God is %0ainside of us; He doesn't exist anywhere else. When we pass away, so does He. %0a%0aThese earthshaking concepts and more are eloquently introduced so that %0aeven readers new to Kabbalah or science will easily understand them. Therefore, %0aif you're just a little curious about why you are here, what life means, and what %0ayou can do to enjoy it more, this book is for you. %0a%0aFrom Chaos to Harmony %0a%0aMany researchers and scientists agree that the ego is the reason behind the %0aperilous state our world is in today. Laitman's groundbreaking book not only %0ademonstrates that ego has been the basis for all suffering throughout human %0ahistory, but also shows how we can turn our plight to pleasure. %0a%0aThe book contains a clear analysis of the human soul and its problems, and %0aprovides a "roadmap" of what we need to do to once again be happy. From Chaos %0ato Harmony explains how we can rise to a new level of existence on personal, %0asocial, national, and international levels. %0a%0aINTERMEDIATE %0a%0aThe Kabbalah Experience %0a%0aThe depth of the wisdom revealed in the questions and answers within this %0abook will inspire readers to reflect and contemplate. This is not a book to race %0athrough, but rather one that should be read thoughtfully and carefully. With %0athis approach, readers will begin to experience a growing sense of enlightenment %0awhile simply absorbing the answers to the questions every Kabbalah student %0aasks along the way. %0a%0a%0a%0a510 %0a%0a%0a%0aAppendix One %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Kabbalah Experience is a guide from the past to the future, revealing %0asituations that all students of Kabbalah will experience at some point along %0atheir journeys. For those who cherish every moment in life, this book offers %0aunparalleled insights into the timeless wisdom of Kabbalah. %0a%0aThe Path of Kahhalah %0a%0aThis unique book combines beginners' material with more advanced concepts %0aand teachings. If you have read a book or two of Laitman's, you will find this %0abook very easy to relate to. %0a%0aWhile touching upon basic concepts such as perception of reality and Freedom %0aof Choice, The Path of Kabbalah goes deeper and expands beyond the scope of %0abeginners' books. The structure of the worlds, for example, is explained in greater %0adetail here than in the "pure" beginners' books. Also described is the spiritual %0aroot of mundane matters such as the Hebrew calendar and the holidays. %0a%0aADVANCED %0a%0aThe Science of Kabbalah %0a%0aKabbalist and scientist Rav Michael Laitman, PhD, designed this book to %0aintroduce readers to the special language and terms of the authentic wisdom %0aof Kabbalah. Here, Rav Laitman reveals authentic Kabbalah in a manner both %0arational and mature. Readers are gradually led to understand the logical design %0aof the Universe and the life that exists in it. %0a%0aThe Science of Kabbalah, a revolutionary work unmatched in its clarity, %0adepth, and appeal to the intellect, will enable readers to approach the more %0atechnical works of Baal HaSulam (Rabbi Yehuda Ashlag), such as The Study %0aof the Ten Sefirot and The Book of Zohar. Readers of this book will enjoy the %0asatisfying answers to the riddles of life that only authentic Kabbalah provides. %0aTravel through the pages and prepare for an astonishing journey into the %0aUpper Worlds. %0a%0aIntroduction to the Book of Zohar %0a%0aThis volume, along with The Science of Kabbalah, is a required preparation %0afor those who wish to understand the hidden message of The Book of Zohar. %0aAmong the many helpful topics dealt with in this text is an introduction to the %0a"language of roots and branches," without which the stories in The Zohar are %0amere fable and legend. Introduction to the Book of Zohar will provide readers with %0a%0a%0a%0aFurther Reading %0a%0a%0a%0a511 %0a%0a%0a%0athe necessary tools to understand authentic Kabbalah as it was originally meant %0ato be, as a means to attain the Upper Worlds. %0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0aThe Book of Zohar (The Book of Radiance) is an ageless source of wisdom and the %0abasis for all Kabbalistic literature. Since its appearance nearly 2,000 years ago, it %0ahas been the primary, and often only, source used by Kabbalists. %0a%0aFor centuries, Kabbalah was hidden from the public, which was deemed %0anot yet ready to receive it. However, our generation has been designated by %0aKabbalists as the first generation that is ready to grasp the concepts in The Zohar. %0aNow, we can put these principles into practice in our lives. %0a%0aWritten in a unique and metaphorical language, The Book of Zohar enriches %0aour understanding of reality and widens our worldview. Although the text %0adeals with one subject only— how to relate to the Creator— it approaches it from %0adifferent angles. This allows each of us to find the particular phrase or word that %0awill carry us into the depths of this profound and timeless wisdom. %0a%0aALL AROUND %0a%0aAttaining the Worlds Beyond %0a%0aFrom the introduction to Attaining the Worlds Beyond: "...Not feeling well on %0athe Jewish New Year in September 1991, my teacher called me to his bedside %0aand handed me his notebook, saying, 'Take it and learn from it.' The following %0amorning, my teacher perished in my arms, leaving me and many of his other %0adisciples without guidance in this world. %0a%0a"He used to say, 'I want to teach you to turn to the Creator, rather than %0ato me, because He is the only strength, the only Source of all that exists, the %0aonly One who can really help you, and He awaits your prayers for help. When %0ayou seek help in your search for freedom from the bondage of this world, help %0ain elevating yourself above this world, help in finding the self, and help in %0adetermining your purpose in life, you must turn to the Creator, who sends you %0aall those aspirations in order to compel you to turn to Him.'" %0a%0aAttaining the Worlds Beyond holds within it the content of that notebook, %0aas well as other inspiring texts. This book reaches out to all those seekers who %0awant to find a logical, reliable way to understand the world's phenomena. This %0afascinating introduction to the wisdom of Kabbalah will enlighten the mind, %0ainvigorate the heart, and move readers to the depths of their souls. %0a%0a%0a%0a512 %0a%0a%0a%0aAppendix One %0a%0a%0a%0aBasic Concepts in Kabbalah %0a%0aThis is a book to help readers cultivate an approach to the concepts of Kabbalah, %0ato spiritual objects, and to spiritual terms. By reading and re-reading in this %0abook, one develops internal observations, senses, and approaches that did not %0apreviously exist within. These newly acquired observations are like sensors that %0a"feel" the space around us that is hidden from our ordinary senses. %0a%0aHence, Basic Concepts in Kabbalah is intended to foster the contemplation %0aof spiritual terms. Once we are integrated with these terms, we can begin to see, %0awith our inner vision, the unveiling of the spiritual structure that surrounds us, %0aalmost as if a mist has been lifted. %0a%0aAgain, this book is not aimed at the study of facts. Instead, it is a book for %0athose who wish to awaken the deepest and subtlest sensations they can possess. %0a%0aTogether Forever %0a%0aOn the surface, Together Forever is a children's story. But like all good children's %0astories, it transcends boundaries of age, culture, and upbringing. %0a%0aIn Together Forever, the author tells us that if we are patient and endure the %0atrials we encounter along our life's path, we will become stronger, braver, and %0awiser. Instead of growing weaker, we will learn to create our own magic and our %0aown wonders as only a magician can. %0a%0aIn this warm, tender tale, Michael Laitman shares with children and %0aparents alike some of the gems and charms of the spiritual world. The wisdom %0aof Kabbalah is filled with spellbinding stories. Together Forever is yet another gift %0afrom this ageless source of wisdom, whose lessons make our lives richer, easier, %0aand far more fulfilling. %0a%0aTEXTBOOKS %0aShamati %0a%0aRav Michael Laitman's words on the book: Among all the texts and notes that %0awere used by my teacher, Rabbi Baruch Shalom Halevi Ashlag (the Rabash), %0athere was one special notebook he always carried. This notebook contained %0athe transcripts of his conversations with his father, Rabbi Yehuda Leib Halevi %0aAshlag (Baal HaSulam), author of the Sulam (Ladder) commentary on The Book %0aof Zohar, The Study of the Ten Sefirot (a commentary on the texts of the Kabbalist, %0aAri), and of many other works on Kabbalah. %0a%0a%0a%0aFurther Reading %0a%0a%0a%0a513 %0a%0a%0a%0aNot feeling well on the Jewish New Year in September 1991, the Rabash %0asummoned me to his bedside and handed me a notebook, whose cover contained %0aonly one word, Shamati (I Heard). As he handed the notebook, he said, "Take %0ait and learn from it." The following morning, my teacher perished in my arms, %0aleaving me and many of his other disciples without guidance in this world. %0a%0aCommitted to Rabash's legacy to disseminate the wisdom of Kabbalah, %0aI published the notebook just as it was written, thus retaining the text's %0atransforming powers. Among all the books of Kabbalah, Shamati is a unique %0aand compelling creation. %0a%0a%0a%0aAppendix Two %0aAbout Bnei Baruch %0a%0a%0a%0aBnei Baruch is a group of Kabbalists in Israel, sharing the wisdom of %0aKabbalah with the entire world. Study materials in over 20 languages %0aare based on authentic Kabbalah texts that were passed down from %0ageneration to generation. %0a%0aHISTORY AND ORIGIN %0a%0aIn 1991, following the passing of his teacher, Rabbi Baruch Shalom HaLevi %0aAshlag (The Rabash), Rav Michael Laitman, Professor of Ontology and the %0aTheory of Knowledge, PhD in Philosophy and Kabbalah, and MSc in Medical %0aBio-Cybernetics, established a Kabbalah study group called "Bnei Baruch." He %0acalled it Bnei Baruch (Sons of Baruch) to commemorate the memory of his %0amentor, whose side he never left in the final twelve years of his life, from 1979 %0ato 1991. Rav Laitman had been Ashlag's prime student and personal assistant, %0aand is recognized as the successor to Rabash's teaching method. %0a%0aThe Rabash was the firstborn son and successor of Rabbi Yehuda Leib %0aHaLevi Ashlag, the greatest Kabbalist of the 20 th century. Rabbi Ashlag authored %0athe most authoritative and comprehensive commentary on The Book of Zohar, %0atitled The Sulam Commentary (The Ladder Commentary). He was the first to reveal %0athe complete method for spiritual ascent, and thus was known as Baal HaSulam %0a(Owner of the Ladder). %0a%0aToday, Bnei Baruch bases its entire study method on the path paved by %0athese two great spiritual leaders. %0a%0aTHE STUDY METHOD %0a%0aThe unique study method developed by Baal HaSulam and his son, the %0aRabash, is taught and applied on a daily basis by Bnei Baruch. This method %0a%0a%0a%0a515 %0a%0a%0a%0a516 %0a%0a%0a%0aAppendix Two %0a%0a%0a%0arelies on authentic Kabbalah sources such as The Book of Zohar, by Rabbi %0aShimon Bar-Yochai, The Tree of Life, by the Holy Ari, and The Study of the Ten %0aSefirot, by Baal HaSulam. %0a%0aWhile the study relies on authentic Kabbalah sources, it is carried out in %0asimple language and uses a scientific, contemporary approach. Developing this %0aapproach has made Bnei Baruch an internationally respected organization, both %0ain Israel and in the world at large. %0a%0aThe unique combination of an academic study method and personal %0aexperiences broadens the students' perspective and awards them a new %0aperception of the reality they live in. Those on the spiritual path are thus given %0athe necessary tools to research themselves and their surrounding reality. %0a%0aTHE MESSAGE %0a%0aBnei Baruch is a diverse movement of many thousands of students worldwide. %0aStudents can choose their own paths and the personal intensity of their studies, %0aaccording to their unique conditions and abilities. The essence of the message %0adisseminated by Bnei Baruch is universal: unity of the people, unity of nations %0aand love of man. %0a%0aFor millennia, Kabbalists have been teaching that love of man should be the %0afoundation of all human relations. This love prevailed in the days of Abraham, %0aMoses, and the group of Kabbalists that they established. If we make room for %0athese seasoned, yet contemporary values, we will discover that we possess the %0apower to put differences aside and unite. %0a%0aThe wisdom of Kabbalah, hidden for millennia, has been waiting for the time %0awhen we would be sufficiently developed and ready to implement its message. %0aNow, it is emerging as a solution that can unite diverse factions everywhere, %0abetter enabling us, as individuals and as a society, to meet today's challenges. %0a%0aACTIVITIES %0a%0aBnei Baruch was established on the premise that "only by expansion of the %0awisdom of Kabbalah to the public can we be awarded complete redemption" %0a(Baal HaSulam). %0a%0aTherefore, Bnei Baruch offers a variety of ways for people to explore and %0adiscover the purpose of their lives, providing careful guidance for the beginners %0aand the advanced students alike. %0a%0a%0a%0aAbout Bnei Baruch %0a%0a%0a%0a517 %0a%0a%0a%0aKabbalah Today %0a%0aKabbalah Today is a free monthly paper produced and disseminated by Bnei Ba- %0aruch.

From Chaos %0a%3c to Harmony explains how we can rise to a new level of existence on personal, %0a%3c social, national, and international levels. %0a%3c %0a%3c INTERMEDIATE %0a%3c %0a%3c The Kabbalah Experience %0a%3c %0a%3c The depth of the wisdom revealed in the questions and answers within this %0a%3c book will inspire readers to reflect and contemplate. This is not a book to race %0a%3c through, but rather one that should be read thoughtfully and carefully. With %0a%3c this approach, readers will begin to experience a growing sense of enlightenment %0a%3c while simply absorbing the answers to the questions every Kabbalah student %0a%3c asks along the way. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 510 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Appendix One %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Kabbalah Experience is a guide from the past to the future, revealing %0a%3c situations that all students of Kabbalah will experience at some point along %0a%3c their journeys. For those who cherish every moment in life, this book offers %0a%3c unparalleled insights into the timeless wisdom of Kabbalah. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Path of Kahhalah %0a%3c %0a%3c This unique book combines beginners' material with more advanced concepts %0a%3c and teachings. If you have read a book or two of Laitman's, you will find this %0a%3c book very easy to relate to. %0a%3c %0a%3c While touching upon basic concepts such as perception of reality and Freedom %0a%3c of Choice, The Path of Kabbalah goes deeper and expands beyond the scope of %0a%3c beginners' books. The structure of the worlds, for example, is explained in greater %0a%3c detail here than in the "pure" beginners' books. Also described is the spiritual %0a%3c root of mundane matters such as the Hebrew calendar and the holidays. %0a%3c %0a%3c ADVANCED %0a%3c %0a%3c The Science of Kabbalah %0a%3c %0a%3c Kabbalist and scientist Rav Michael Laitman, PhD, designed this book to %0a%3c introduce readers to the special language and terms of the authentic wisdom %0a%3c of Kabbalah. Here, Rav Laitman reveals authentic Kabbalah in a manner both %0a%3c rational and mature. Readers are gradually led to understand the logical design %0a%3c of the Universe and the life that exists in it. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Science of Kabbalah, a revolutionary work unmatched in its clarity, %0a%3c depth, and appeal to the intellect, will enable readers to approach the more %0a%3c technical works of Baal HaSulam (Rabbi Yehuda Ashlag), such as The Study %0a%3c of the Ten Sefirot and The Book of Zohar. Readers of this book will enjoy the %0a%3c satisfying answers to the riddles of life that only authentic Kabbalah provides. %0a%3c Travel through the pages and prepare for an astonishing journey into the %0a%3c Upper Worlds. %0a%3c %0a%3c Introduction to the Book of Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c This volume, along with The Science of Kabbalah, is a required preparation %0a%3c for those who wish to understand the hidden message of The Book of Zohar. %0a%3c Among the many helpful topics dealt with in this text is an introduction to the %0a%3c "language of roots and branches," without which the stories in The Zohar are %0a%3c mere fable and legend. Introduction to the Book of Zohar will provide readers with %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Further Reading %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 511 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c the necessary tools to understand authentic Kabbalah as it was originally meant %0a%3c to be, as a means to attain the Upper Worlds. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c The Book of Zohar (The Book of Radiance) is an ageless source of wisdom and the %0a%3c basis for all Kabbalistic literature. Since its appearance nearly 2,000 years ago, it %0a%3c has been the primary, and often only, source used by Kabbalists. %0a%3c %0a%3c For centuries, Kabbalah was hidden from the public, which was deemed %0a%3c not yet ready to receive it. However, our generation has been designated by %0a%3c Kabbalists as the first generation that is ready to grasp the concepts in The Zohar. %0a%3c Now, we can put these principles into practice in our lives. %0a%3c %0a%3c Written in a unique and metaphorical language, The Book of Zohar enriches %0a%3c our understanding of reality and widens our worldview. Although the text %0a%3c deals with one subject only— how to relate to the Creator— it approaches it from %0a%3c different angles. This allows each of us to find the particular phrase or word that %0a%3c will carry us into the depths of this profound and timeless wisdom. %0a%3c %0a%3c ALL AROUND %0a%3c %0a%3c Attaining the Worlds Beyond %0a%3c %0a%3c From the introduction to Attaining the Worlds Beyond: "...Not feeling well on %0a%3c the Jewish New Year in September 1991, my teacher called me to his bedside %0a%3c and handed me his notebook, saying, 'Take it and learn from it.' The following %0a%3c morning, my teacher perished in my arms, leaving me and many of his other %0a%3c disciples without guidance in this world. %0a%3c %0a%3c "He used to say, 'I want to teach you to turn to the Creator, rather than %0a%3c to me, because He is the only strength, the only Source of all that exists, the %0a%3c only One who can really help you, and He awaits your prayers for help. When %0a%3c you seek help in your search for freedom from the bondage of this world, help %0a%3c in elevating yourself above this world, help in finding the self, and help in %0a%3c determining your purpose in life, you must turn to the Creator, who sends you %0a%3c all those aspirations in order to compel you to turn to Him.'" %0a%3c %0a%3c Attaining the Worlds Beyond holds within it the content of that notebook, %0a%3c as well as other inspiring texts. This book reaches out to all those seekers who %0a%3c want to find a logical, reliable way to understand the world's phenomena. This %0a%3c fascinating introduction to the wisdom of Kabbalah will enlighten the mind, %0a%3c invigorate the heart, and move readers to the depths of their souls. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 512 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Appendix One %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Basic Concepts in Kabbalah %0a%3c %0a%3c This is a book to help readers cultivate an approach to the concepts of Kabbalah, %0a%3c to spiritual objects, and to spiritual terms. By reading and re-reading in this %0a%3c book, one develops internal observations, senses, and approaches that did not %0a%3c previously exist within. These newly acquired observations are like sensors that %0a%3c "feel" the space around us that is hidden from our ordinary senses. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, Basic Concepts in Kabbalah is intended to foster the contemplation %0a%3c of spiritual terms. Once we are integrated with these terms, we can begin to see, %0a%3c with our inner vision, the unveiling of the spiritual structure that surrounds us, %0a%3c almost as if a mist has been lifted. %0a%3c %0a%3c Again, this book is not aimed at the study of facts. Instead, it is a book for %0a%3c those who wish to awaken the deepest and subtlest sensations they can possess. %0a%3c %0a%3c Together Forever %0a%3c %0a%3c On the surface, Together Forever is a children's story. But like all good children's %0a%3c stories, it transcends boundaries of age, culture, and upbringing. %0a%3c %0a%3c In Together Forever, the author tells us that if we are patient and endure the %0a%3c trials we encounter along our life's path, we will become stronger, braver, and %0a%3c wiser. Instead of growing weaker, we will learn to create our own magic and our %0a%3c own wonders as only a magician can. %0a%3c %0a%3c In this warm, tender tale, Michael Laitman shares with children and %0a%3c parents alike some of the gems and charms of the spiritual world. The wisdom %0a%3c of Kabbalah is filled with spellbinding stories. Together Forever is yet another gift %0a%3c from this ageless source of wisdom, whose lessons make our lives richer, easier, %0a%3c and far more fulfilling. %0a%3c %0a%3c TEXTBOOKS %0a%3c Shamati %0a%3c %0a%3c Rav Michael Laitman's words on the book: Among all the texts and notes that %0a%3c were used by my teacher, Rabbi Baruch Shalom Halevi Ashlag (the Rabash), %0a%3c there was one special notebook he always carried. This notebook contained %0a%3c the transcripts of his conversations with his father, Rabbi Yehuda Leib Halevi %0a%3c Ashlag (Baal HaSulam), author of the Sulam (Ladder) commentary on The Book %0a%3c of Zohar, The Study of the Ten Sefirot (a commentary on the texts of the Kabbalist, %0a%3c Ari), and of many other works on Kabbalah. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Further Reading %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 513 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Not feeling well on the Jewish New Year in September 1991, the Rabash %0a%3c summoned me to his bedside and handed me a notebook, whose cover contained %0a%3c only one word, Shamati (I Heard). As he handed the notebook, he said, "Take %0a%3c it and learn from it." The following morning, my teacher perished in my arms, %0a%3c leaving me and many of his other disciples without guidance in this world. %0a%3c %0a%3c Committed to Rabash's legacy to disseminate the wisdom of Kabbalah, %0a%3c I published the notebook just as it was written, thus retaining the text's %0a%3c transforming powers. Among all the books of Kabbalah, Shamati is a unique %0a%3c and compelling creation. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Appendix Two %0a%3c About Bnei Baruch %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Bnei Baruch is a group of Kabbalists in Israel, sharing the wisdom of %0a%3c Kabbalah with the entire world. Study materials in over 20 languages %0a%3c are based on authentic Kabbalah texts that were passed down from %0a%3c generation to generation. %0a%3c %0a%3c HISTORY AND ORIGIN %0a%3c %0a%3c In 1991, following the passing of his teacher, Rabbi Baruch Shalom HaLevi %0a%3c Ashlag (The Rabash), Rav Michael Laitman, Professor of Ontology and the %0a%3c Theory of Knowledge, PhD in Philosophy and Kabbalah, and MSc in Medical %0a%3c Bio-Cybernetics, established a Kabbalah study group called "Bnei Baruch." He %0a%3c called it Bnei Baruch (Sons of Baruch) to commemorate the memory of his %0a%3c mentor, whose side he never left in the final twelve years of his life, from 1979 %0a%3c to 1991. Rav Laitman had been Ashlag's prime student and personal assistant, %0a%3c and is recognized as the successor to Rabash's teaching method. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Rabash was the firstborn son and successor of Rabbi Yehuda Leib %0a%3c HaLevi Ashlag, the greatest Kabbalist of the 20 th century. Rabbi Ashlag authored %0a%3c the most authoritative and comprehensive commentary on The Book of Zohar, %0a%3c titled The Sulam Commentary (The Ladder Commentary). He was the first to reveal %0a%3c the complete method for spiritual ascent, and thus was known as Baal HaSulam %0a%3c (Owner of the Ladder). %0a%3c %0a%3c Today, Bnei Baruch bases its entire study method on the path paved by %0a%3c these two great spiritual leaders. %0a%3c %0a%3c THE STUDY METHOD %0a%3c %0a%3c The unique study method developed by Baal HaSulam and his son, the %0a%3c Rabash, is taught and applied on a daily basis by Bnei Baruch. This method %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 515 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 516 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Appendix Two %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c relies on authentic Kabbalah sources such as The Book of Zohar, by Rabbi %0a%3c Shimon Bar-Yochai, The Tree of Life, by the Holy Ari, and The Study of the Ten %0a%3c Sefirot, by Baal HaSulam. %0a%3c %0a%3c While the study relies on authentic Kabbalah sources, it is carried out in %0a%3c simple language and uses a scientific, contemporary approach. Developing this %0a%3c approach has made Bnei Baruch an internationally respected organization, both %0a%3c in Israel and in the world at large. %0a%3c %0a%3c The unique combination of an academic study method and personal %0a%3c experiences broadens the students' perspective and awards them a new %0a%3c perception of the reality they live in. Those on the spiritual path are thus given %0a%3c the necessary tools to research themselves and their surrounding reality. %0a%3c %0a%3c THE MESSAGE %0a%3c %0a%3c Bnei Baruch is a diverse movement of many thousands of students worldwide. %0a%3c Students can choose their own paths and the personal intensity of their studies, %0a%3c according to their unique conditions and abilities. The essence of the message %0a%3c disseminated by Bnei Baruch is universal: unity of the people, unity of nations %0a%3c and love of man. %0a%3c %0a%3c For millennia, Kabbalists have been teaching that love of man should be the %0a%3c foundation of all human relations. This love prevailed in the days of Abraham, %0a%3c Moses, and the group of Kabbalists that they established. If we make room for %0a%3c these seasoned, yet contemporary values, we will discover that we possess the %0a%3c power to put differences aside and unite. %0a%3c %0a%3c The wisdom of Kabbalah, hidden for millennia, has been waiting for the time %0a%3c when we would be sufficiently developed and ready to implement its message. %0a%3c Now, it is emerging as a solution that can unite diverse factions everywhere, %0a%3c better enabling us, as individuals and as a society, to meet today's challenges. %0a%3c %0a%3c ACTIVITIES %0a%3c %0a%3c Bnei Baruch was established on the premise that "only by expansion of the %0a%3c wisdom of Kabbalah to the public can we be awarded complete redemption" %0a%3c (Baal HaSulam). %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, Bnei Baruch offers a variety of ways for people to explore and %0a%3c discover the purpose of their lives, providing careful guidance for the beginners %0a%3c and the advanced students alike. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c About Bnei Baruch %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 517 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Kabbalah Today %0a%3c %0a%3c Kabbalah Today is a free monthly paper produced and disseminated by Bnei Ba- %0a%3c ruch.
