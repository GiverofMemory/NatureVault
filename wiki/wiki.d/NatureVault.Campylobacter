csum=rhythmic on-and-off cramping in the intestines some people associate with having to go to the bathroom, may be campylobacter (or possibly [[strongyloides]]).  This can happen especially when treating with [[h pylori]] using [[ellagic acid]].  This cramping is countered with [[ginger]], if it is in fact caused by campy.  However the ginger likely will not help before one has to go to the bathroom.  If one does not have to go to the bathroom, taking ginger might help push it through.
