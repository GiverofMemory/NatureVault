csum= I don't know how anyone can have standing water for animals without additives like lugols iodine and herbs powders added like garlic, ginger, cinnamon, turmeric and probiotics like lactobacillus reuteri/plantarum, bifidobacterium infantis/adolescentis, and s boulardii.  These will not only help make the water not get infected but also act as a worm preventative and increase growth and feed conversion and resilient health.  There is no reason not to do it all the time, once a month is definitely not enough to keep humans or animals healthy.  If you are using dr bronners add a little cinnamon, lavender/peppermint, thyme essential oil to the soap, shake it up, and use that in place of just the dr bronners but you should give probiotics too.

The dried and ground green hull of the Black Walnut contains tannin, which is organic iodine, as well as juglandin. Black walnut has been used for centuries to expel various types of worms, including parasites that cause skin irritations such as ringworm. It oxygenates the blood, which also helps kill parasites. Black Walnut is very effective against tapeworms, pinworms, Candida albicans (yeast infections) and malaria. It is also effective in reducing blood sugar levels, and helping the body rid itself of toxins.%0a%0a*GRAVIOLA BARK%0a**Graviola is a major component used in our formula because of the amazing results for purging parasites. Graviola has a great record in killing intestinal parasites, calming nerves, reducing blood pressure and helping arthritis, heart and liver.http://www.graviolaleaves.com/ Some people saw parasites in their toilets after just one day! Graviola has been researched in laboratory tests since the 1970s, where it’s been shown to: effectively target and kill malignant cells in 12 different types of cancer, including colon, breast, prostate, lung and pancreatic cancer...10,000 times stronger in killing colon cancer cells than Adriamycin (a commonly used chemotherapeutic drug). Selectively hunt down and kill cancer cells without harming healthy cells, unlike chemotherapy. Reference: http://www.greenwoodhealth.net/np/graviola.htm Graviola contains the chemical annonaceous acetogenins, the active compound that is harmful to parasites.%0a%0a*QUASSIA%0a**A tree native to Jamaica and its neighboring islands, has traditionally been used as a remedy for roundworms and as an insecticide. It has also been used as a bitter digestive aid and a remedy for digestive disorders, parasites, and head lice. http://www.naturalstandard.com%0a%0a*BUTTERNUT BARK%0a**Used specifically for parasite cleansing. Butternut is a native of the midwestern and northeastern United States and been used since the 1800s as a laxative and in the elimination of parasites. Butternut is also used to support healthy liver function. Butternut, also called White Walnut, is used to expel, rather than kill, worms (vermifuge).%0a%0a*WORMWOOD%0a**Named for its ability to expel parasites, this bitter herb is known world wide for its strong killing ability. This is one of the most powerful tools in the parasite-killing herb kingdom. It is most effective against roundworms, hookworms, whipworms and pinworms. Wormwood contains the potent chemicals thujone and isothujone, which are the primary components that kill parasites. Wormwood also contains santonin, an effective remedy for parasitic diseases. Wormwood is the second most bitter herb known to man and has been proven as a powerful remedy for malaria. Wormwood also contains sesquiterpene lactones, which work similarly to peroxide by weakening the parasites membranes therefore killing them. Wormwood also helps produce bile, which in turn helps the liver and gallbladder.%0a%0a*DIATOMATIOUS EARTH%0a**Food-grade version used to act as a parasite shredder. Diatoms act like glass passing over skin, cutting the fragile flesh of all living adult parasites on contact (without harming humans).%0a%0a*RHUBARB%0a**Used to help expel the die-off of parasites, eggs and larva. We chose rhubarb as it is not addictive like other colon movement stimulants and is very powerful even in a low dosage.%0a%0a*CLOVE%0a**Cloves contains the most powerful germicidal agent in the herbal kingdom known as eugenol. It also contains caryophyllene which is powerful antimicrobial agents. These components travel through the bloodstream, killing microscopic parasites and parasitic larvae and eggs. Cloves are tremendously effective in killing malaria, tuberculosis, cholera, scabies and other parasites, viruses, bacteria and fungi, including Candida. Cloves also destroy all species of Shigella, Staphylococcus, and Streptococcus.%0a%0a*PUMPKIN SEEDS%0a**Able to kill eggs, contains a natural fat that is toxic to parasite eggs. Curcurbitin in pumpkin seeds has shown anti-parasitic activity since it has the ability to paralyze worms so they drop off the intestinal walls Chinese scientists used pumpkin seeds to treat acute schistosomiasis and tapeworm infestations.%0a%0a*POMEGRANATE SEEDS (ELLAGITANNIN)%0a**When ground up, pomegranate seeds contain one of the most powerful antioxidants known- Ellagitannin (Ellagic acid). Aside from being used very successfully in cancer treatment, Ellagitannin has also been found to be a powerful destroyer of parasites. It’s a very strong anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, anti-viral that lowers cholesterol and protects our DNA. This is very expensive and hard to get but worth every molecule.%0a%0a*ALOE VERA%0a**This plant, called the herb of immortality by the Egyptians, contains a soothing gel that helps peristalsis. Aloe vera have antibacterial and anti-fungal activities. Also aloe destroys bacteria more powerful than any other hypoallergenic plant known.%0a%0a*PAPAIN%0a**Papain is a protein digestive enzyme that works synergistically with herbs to further break down material. This digestive enzyme will help restore your intestinal tract to its normal state, which makes it inhospitable to parasites. Papain taken 30 minutes before or after meals helps kill worms.%0a%0a*GOAT’S RUE%0a**Goat’s rue is a wild legume used during the Middle Ages to treat the plague. It was also used to induce sweating to break fevers and to treat infections with parasitic worms and snakebite. This herb can help balance blood sugar levels, help women balance hormones, and the plant has no odor unless a stem or leaf is bruised, causing the release of a stench, hence the name goat’s rue. Effective in both humans and animals alike.%0a%0a*GARLIC%0a**Garlic is able to slow and kill over 60 types of fungus and 20 types of bacteria, as well as some of the most potent viruses. Garlic has a history of killing parasites and controlling secondary fungal infections, detoxifying while gently stimulating elimination, and has antioxidant properties to protect against oxidation caused by parasite toxins. The active components in garlic that kill parasites are Allicin and Ajoene. These compounds can kill amoebas including one-cell varieties, as well as pinworms and hookworms. Allicin is not present in garlic in its natural state. When garlic is chopped or otherwise damaged, the enzyme alliinase acts on the chemical alliin converting it into allicin, the active component contributing for its success for killing parasites.%0a%0a*TUMERIC ROOT%0a**Turmeric has stronger anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties than milk thistle. Turmeric has been shown in studies to block the formation of cancer through many mechanisms. It helps clean the blood and liver.

Effective in both humans and animals alike.%0a%3c %0a%3c *GARLIC%0a%3c **Garlic is able to slow and kill over 60 types of fungus and 20 types of bacteria, as well as some of the most potent viruses. Garlic has a history of killing parasites and controlling secondary fungal infections, detoxifying while gently stimulating elimination, and has antioxidant properties to protect against oxidation caused by parasite toxins. The active components in garlic that kill parasites are Allicin and Ajoene. These compounds can kill amoebas including one-cell varieties, as well as pinworms and hookworms. Allicin is not present in garlic in its natural state. When garlic is chopped or otherwise damaged, the enzyme alliinase acts on the chemical alliin converting it into allicin, the active component contributing for its success for killing parasites.%0a%3c %0a%3c *TUMERIC ROOT%0a%3c **Turmeric has stronger anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties than milk thistle. Turmeric has been shown in studies to block the formation of cancer through many mechanisms. It helps clean the blood and liver.%0a\ No newline at end of file%0a---%0a> *Ginger root%0a\ No newline at end of file%0a
