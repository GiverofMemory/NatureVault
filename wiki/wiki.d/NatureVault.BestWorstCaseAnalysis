People are global and we cannot pick where they choose to live.  So we assume worst case that they are on polar opposites of the planet.  We also assume that these two nodes are sitting on the equator and worst case is the data path traveled would be on the equator which is the longest distance between any two points on earth.  Since we can't control where these data paths are, and we don't know that datapaths are necessarily moving towards infinity, we have to assume worst case that they can only communicate across the equator, so we use equatorial circumference of the earth in our speed pf data transfer equation.
