text=Among All the Sages of the Nations %0aof the World, There Are None Like You %0a%0a%0a%0a161. Rabbi Elazar said, "It is written: 'Who would not fear the King of the %0anations of the world?' What kind of praise is this?" Rabbi Shimon replied: %0a"Elazar, my son, this has been said in several places. However, one should %0anot understand the verse, 'For among all the sages of the nations of the %0aworld, and in all their kingdoms, there are none like You' in its simple, literal %0ainterpretation. This is because it naturally gives rise to evil intentions of %0asinners— those who think that the Creator is not aware of their dark thoughts, %0adoubts and intents. Therefore, their folly must be clarified. A philosopher %0aof one of the nations of the world came to me and said, 'You say that your %0aCreator governs the entire Heavens, and that all the Heavenly hosts are unable %0ato attain Him, nor come to know His dwelling place. However, this does not %0aadd to His greatness, as it is written, 'among all the sages of the nations of %0athe world, and in all their kingdoms, there is none like You.' What kind of a %0acomparison is this when He is compared to man, who is nothing?'" %0a%0aThis is similar to what is written about sinners in Psalms (Tehilim, 73:11-12): %0a"And they say: 'How does the Creator know? And is there knowledge in Him? %0aBehold the wicked; they are always at peace, rich and powerful.'" This is exactly %0awhat the philosopher says. He was one of the greatest sages among the nations of %0athe world, and he came to Rabbi Shimon to dishonor Israel's wisdom and work %0ain absolute faith for the Creator's sake, which ought to be in great wholeness, %0aperfection, purity, and integrity, for no thought can grasp Him. %0a%0aThis sage was a representative of the philosophers who asserted that the %0amain principle in working for the Creator is to attain Him, rather than serve %0aHim in faith, for in their understanding, they attain Him. And now he has %0acome to ridicule Israel's approach. %0a%0a337 %0a%0a%0a%0a338 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aHence, he said: "The Creator is above all human wisdom, and thereby He %0arules, and He bid you to work for Him in faith and purity, and have no doubts in %0aHim, for the human mind cannot grasp Him. After all, even the Heavenly hosts, %0aHis legions and angels are unable to attain Him, as it is written of those who say: %0a'Blessed be the Creator in His place,' for they do not know 'His place.'" %0a%0aHowever, the phrase, "as among all the sages of the world, there is none like %0athe Creator" does not imply the Creator's greatness. Indeed, if this prophetic %0aexpression is used in order to exalt the God of Israel and show that He is greater %0athan the god attained by the sages of the nations of the world by their human %0astrength and reason, then naturally, this does not add to the glory of the God of %0aIsrael, as He is being compared to trifle and transient forces. On the contrary, %0athis statement shows great disdain for your Creator, when you compare Him to %0athe sages of the nations of the world, who are mortal and restricted creatures. %0aThose were the words that the scholarly sage, who represented the wisdom of %0athe nations of the world, uttered before Rabbi Shimon. %0a%0aClearly, The Zohar is referring to some overseas sage who paid a visit to Rabbi %0aShimon. Just like all the other names of places and characters mentioned in the %0aTorah, the Talmud, and the Kabbalah, names of places, animals, people, and %0aactions described in The Zohar speak only of the spiritual world, the Creator's %0aactions, and how one can achieve the goal of creation. In no way does any of this %0arelate to events in our world! %0a%0aTherefore, the "sage of the nations of the world" symbolizes man's own %0aegoistic property to research and know everything, instead of having faith above %0areason, as the Torah demands. This human property, called a "sage of the %0anations of the world," the egoistic reason, is in a state of constant argument %0awith man's spiritual, altruistic property, called "Israel" or the aspiration to the %0aCreator. Thus, by opposing it, man builds himself and grows. %0a%0a162. Furthermore, you claim, as your Torah says, that "There had not risen %0aa prophet since in Israel like Moshe." There are none in Israel, but there is %0aone among the nations of the world! So I claim the same: there is none like %0aYou among all the sages of the nations of the world, but among the sages of %0aIsrael there is one like You. However, if there is one like Him among the sages %0aof Israel, then He cannot be the Supreme Ruler. Look closely into my words, %0aand you shall see that I am right. %0a%0aHere the philosopher (man's egoistic voice) spoke wisely. He understood %0athat should he speak directly, he would hear precise answers to his questions. It %0ais written: "Among all the sages of the nations of the world, there are none like %0a%0a%0a%0aAmong All the Sages, There Are None Like You 339 %0a%0aYou," meaning that there is no one that can attain You. For the words, "there %0aare none like You" imply that You have no equals, that it is impossible to attain %0aYou, attain Your degree. %0a%0aHowever, since the sages of the nations of the world (human reason) take %0apride in their attainment of the Creator (that they understand His intentions %0aand actions), they consider themselves similar to Him, for attainment means %0asimilarity of properties with the attained degree. This is why it is considered a %0alie, and that there are none like Him, for they do not attain the Creator, but %0aonly delude themselves by thinking that they do. %0a%0aThe philosopher (within man) understood that, and hence began (leading %0aman astray from the path of faith, which surpasses and defies reason) with a %0acompletely different question: "If it is explicitly said that no one is equal to the %0aCreator among the sages of the other nations, does it not mean that there are %0athose who can attain Him among the sages of Israel? Otherwise, why would it be %0anecessary to specify that there are none like Him among the sages of the nations %0aof the world? %0a%0a"But if this is so, and He is similar to you, then He cannot be the Supreme %0aRuler! Thus, how can you say that the God of Israel cannot be attained by %0areason and that He governs all? You speak by means of faith in His greatness, %0abut indeed there are those among your sages who are like Him, i.e., those who %0aattain Him." %0a%0a163. Rabbi Shimon said to him, "You object correctly that there are those %0aamong the sages of Israel who are similar to the Creator, for who resurrects %0athe dead back to life, if not the Creator Himself? Yet, Eliyahu and Elisha %0acame and resurrected the dead back to life! Who causes rain to fall if not the %0aCreator Himself? Yet, Eliyahu came and abolished rain, and then summoned %0ait through his prayer! Who created the Heavens and the earth, if not the %0aCreator Himself? Yet, Avraham came, and, as it is written, the Heavens and %0athe earth were revived." %0a%0aRabbi Shimon replies that the (inner) sage speaks the truth when he %0aasserts that there are those among the sages of Israel who are similar to the %0aCreator. However, in no way does this revoke the simple faith in the Creator's %0aunattainability by human reason. Of course, He is the master and ruler of the %0aHeavens, and He is so much higher than all of them that even the Supernal %0aangels cannot attain Him and do not know His place. %0a%0aYet, the Torah and Mitzvot (commandments) were given to us precisely for %0athis purpose— so that by observing the Mitzvot (making a Zivug between the screen %0a%0a%0a%0a340 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aand the Light) and studying the Torah (receiving the Light) for the Creator's %0asake, we, Israel (those who aspire to the Creator) would completely merge with %0aHim (in our properties), so His Light would permeate us and clothe in us to %0asuch an extent that we would merit (begin to desire and receive the power of %0aa screen) carrying out the same actions as the Creator: resurrecting the dead %0a(correcting egoism), summoning rains (Ohr Hassadim), and reviving Heaven and %0aearth (filling all the Partzufim in all the worlds with the Light of our actions). %0a%0aIn that, we are just like Him, as it is said: "By Your deeds (by experiencing %0athem on myself) I will know You." However, we attain all this only through %0aabsolute and devout faith (the property of Bind), which leaves within us no %0adesires whatsoever to attain Him with our reason (to verify first and act next), %0aas in the path of sages of the nations of the world (our egoism). Our egoism %0aconsists of a Partzuf called a "sage of the nations of the world." Its Rosh (head) %0adesignates knowledge and desire to attain everything, and its Guf (body) is the %0awill to receive pleasure for oneself. %0a%0aThe philosopher argues that if Israel can do what the Creator does, then %0aIsrael attains Him. This is correct, for if one is able to act like the Creator, then, %0ato the extent of his actions, he attains and perceives Him. After all, it is said: "By %0aYour deeds I will know You." If one acts like the Creator, then he understands %0athe Creator's analogous actions in his own actions, and thus perceives Him. %0aHowever, one must first advance by faith above reason, and as a result, he attains %0athe Creator's properties, thereby becoming like Him in his actions. %0a%0a164. (Rabbi Shimon continues:) "Who governs the sun, if not the Creator? %0aYet, Yehoshua came and stopped it. The Creator issues His decree, yet Moshe %0aimmediately issues a decree of his own, and it is carried out. The Creator wishes %0ato punish, and the righteous of Israel annul His verdict. Moreover, He bid us %0ato closely follow His ways and to be like Him in every way." The philosopher %0athen went and became Israel, and lived in the village of Shachalayim, and they %0acalled him Yosi HaKatan (Little Yosi). He studied the Torah a great deal, and %0awas among the sages and the righteous of that village. %0a%0aThe problem is that if a person does everything only by means of his faith, %0ahe denies himself the chance to attain the Creator, for attainment comes %0athrough applying reason. However, the moment he begins to apply his reason, he %0aimmediately diminishes his faith. So how can one combine faith with reason? %0a%0aIt is true that those who aspire to draw nearer the Creator (those who are %0acalled Israel) diminish their simple, devout faith. However, they do this only %0abecause He bids them to do so in order to attain His actions, and thus become %0alike Him, as it is said in the Torah: "Follow His way" (Devarim, 21). Hence, %0a%0a%0a%0aAmong All the Sages, There Are None Like You 341 %0a%0athey observe His commandments. The philosopher was so overwhelmed by this %0atruth that he became "Israel" and started observing the Torah and Mitzvot. %0a%0aHe was overwhelmed when he had found that Israel's actions, their %0aattainments of the spiritual worlds, did not diminish their faith above reason, for %0aall of their actions and attainments were based on faith. Israel attains the Creator %0abecause He bids them to, not because they desire this with their egoism. %0a%0a165. And now the time has come to take a closer look at this verse. It is %0awritten that all the nations of the world are nothing before Him. Yet, how %0adoes this exalt Him? Hence, it is written: "Who sees the King of the nations %0aof the world?" Yet, is the King of the nations of the world also not the King of %0aIsrael? The Creator wishes to elevate Israel in all places; this is why He is called %0aeverywhere "the King of Israel." The other nations of the world say that they %0ahave another King up in the Heavens, for it seems to them that He governs %0aonly them, and not us. %0a%0aThe nations of the world are certain that their Supernal King is not the %0aKing of Israel, that the King who sits in the Heavens and governs them is %0aonly their King, and that the King of Israel has no power over them. Thus, it %0aseems to man's egoism that it exists under some other (non-altruistic) system of %0agovernance, and not altruism. The egoism fails to realize that the Creator made %0ait exactly the way it is so as to achieve His goal: using egoism, to bring man to %0aaltruism, from "for one's own self to "for the Creator's sake." %0a%0a166. It is written: "Who would not fear the King of the nations of the world?" %0a(Xirmiyahu, 10:7) That is, their Supernal King is there to threaten and %0apersecute them, and do with them as He pleases. Hence, He should be feared. %0aAnd all fear Him Above and below. For it is written that among all the sages of %0athe nations of the world (the angels that rule over these nations) and in their %0aKingdoms (Above) there is none like You. There are four Kingdoms Above %0athat rule over all the nations of the world according to the Creator's will. And %0athere is no one who can do even the smallest action without His personal %0ainstruction. The sages of the nations of the world are the forces that rule them %0afrom Above, and all the wisdom of the nations of the world comes from these %0arulers. "In all their Kingdoms" means that the Creator's will rules over them. %0a%0aThese lines describe how the bride, who is in a state of exile, prepares herself %0afor her future, final correction. The power of the nations of the world (in every %0aone of us) amounts to conquering us (the altruistic desires for the Creator) and %0aplacing us under their power (serving only the body). They wish to drive us away %0a%0a%0a%0a342 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0afrom the Creator's rule and let other desires, called "the nations of the world" %0adominate us. Our egoistic desires, the nations of the world, do so because of %0atheir power (tempting us with various pleasures) and wisdom (appealing to our %0acommon sense). %0a%0aTheir actions over us (spiritual aspirations) stem from the system of the %0aimpure forces and their impure (egoistic) angels (our inner egoistic forces), %0awhich give power and reason to the nations of the world. With the help of %0atheir wisdom, they (our egoistic desires) lead us (the sons of Israel, those who %0aaspire only to the Creator) to all sorts of doubts and desires to understand %0athe Creator, His ways and thoughts, without any fear or reverence before His %0agreatness and supremacy. %0a%0aBecause of these doubts, we draw far from the Creator and His Supernal %0aLight, which, as a result, passes on to them (our egoistic desires), as it is %0awritten, "Tzur (the capital of the impure forces) was built only on the ruins of %0aJerusalem (the capital of the pure forces)." Thus, they acquire the strength to %0apersecute and humiliate Israel, and force them to submit to their will (suppress %0athe only true path to the spiritual— faith above and in defiance of reason— with %0atheir persuasions and proof of their "real" rightfulness). And as it was already %0aexplained in the "Introduction to the Book of Zohar" (items 69-71), our inner %0aspiritual enslavement leads to our external, corporeal enslavement, persecution, %0aand humiliation by the nations of the world. %0a%0aThis is the secret of the four Kingdoms that rule over us in our four (spiritual %0aand therefore physical) exiles, which correspond to Sefirot H-B-ZA-M, symbolized %0aby Nebuchadnezzar, as it is written: "Here is that idol, its head made of pure %0agold, its breast and its arms of silver, its belly and its thighs of brass, its shins of %0airon, and its feet part iron and part clay" (Daniel, 2:32-33). %0a%0aWhen this idol governs us, the nations of the world mock us, claiming %0athat they have a King of their own. However, such was the Creator's plan, as %0ait is said: "The Creator hath so made it, that men should fear Him" (Kohelet, %0a3:14), for the sensation of the Creator, called Shechina, is also referred to as fear %0abefore Him. However, since we do not yet feel the greatness and supremacy of %0athe Creator, we do not merit fearing Him, and live in fear of the King of the %0anations of the world. %0a%0aThis points to the fact that we have no other way of completely and eternally %0amerging with the Creator other than by means of tremendous fear before His %0agreatness, by assuming His Torah and His desires (Mitzvot) in devout and %0acomplete faith, without any doubts in His properties. %0a%0a%0a%0aAmong All the Sages, There Are None Like You %0a%0a%0a%0a343 %0a%0a%0a%0aOnly then will we merge with Him in absolute, eternal union, and the %0aCreator will impart us with all the goodness for which He had created us. He %0aconceived this in the beginning of creation, and it became the purpose behind %0athe whole of creation. This state is considered the complete and final deliverance %0aand correction. %0a%0aHowever, before the attainment of such an exalted spiritual state, this is how %0athe prophet describes those who aspire to the Creator: "You have sown much, %0aand brought in little; you eat but you have not enough; you drink but your thirst %0ais not quenched" (Haggai, 1:6), for in all of our actions (of those who aspire to %0athe spiritual) the impure force (egoism) constantly takes all the Light for itself. %0aThis occurs as a result of our doubts with regard to faith in the Creator, which %0athe impure force itself cultivates within us. %0a%0aHowever, the purpose of these punishments is not to cause us grief! Everything %0ahappens according to the Creator's plan and serves only to promote us toward %0acorrection. Therefore, as long as man can listen only to egoistic arguments, the %0aCreator develops us gradually, using these forces. With their help, we gradually %0abecome fit to feel fear of the Creator, through the many trials and sufferings our %0a%0aBut in the end, we merit the reception of complete and devoted faith and fear %0abefore His greatness. It is written of this state: "He remembered His mercy and His %0aallegiance toward the house of Israel, and all the worthless creatures of the earth %0awitnessed the help and deliverance at the Creator's hands" (Tehilim, 98:3). %0a%0aThis is because at the end of days, the Creator will remember us in His %0amercy, and will give us the strength to receive complete and devout faith in Him. %0aThus, Jerusalem (the capital of altruism) will be rebuilt on the ruins of Tzur %0a(the capital of egoism), for all the Light, which Malchut of the impure force was %0arobbing of us throughout our exile from the spiritual, will return to us when we %0aacquire complete and devout faith, and will shine within us with all its might. %0a%0aAll the worthless creatures of the earth (manifestations of egoism) will then %0asee with their own eyes how our Creator saves (corrects) them. For all the nations %0aof the world (within us) will see that they have always possessed this Light until %0athe very last moment before their correction so as to give it back to us at the %0aappropriate time. And all shall see that "one man's rule over another is to the %0adetriment of the ruler!" (Kohelet, 8:9). %0a%0aThe burden of our slavery and the impure force's rule over us (over holiness) %0aharms only the impure force, for it thereby compels us to attain complete and %0adevoted faith in the Creator even faster! And the prophet speaks of this time, %0a%0a%0a%0a344 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0aAt they %0a„He m %0a%0a%0a%0a"Who would not fear the King of the nations of the world?" for it has now been %0arevealed that He is the King of the nations of the world, who persecutes and %0adominates those nations. It previously seemed to them (our egoistic intentions) %0athat they persecuted us (our altruistic intentions), but now the opposite has %0abeen revealed to them— that they were merely blind enactors of the Creator's %0awill, our servants and our slaves, whose purpose is to bring us to perfection. %0a%0aIt seemed to us that they were beating us. Now it turns out that they were beat- %0a; themselves, for thanks to these blows (suffering from unrealized egoistic desires %0ait frustration), they have accelerated our deliverance and attainr %0a)ur realization of the need to choose the path of faith above re %0ahave also accelerated their own demise (their own correctior %0a%0aAnd wherever it seemed to us (our reason) that they rebelled against the %0aCreator (argued that the Creator is not the source of all reality) and acted %0a(supposedly) however they pleased so as to humiliate us and satiate their base %0aegoistic desires, and it appeared that there was no (Supernal) judge and no law %0a(the advancement of creation toward its goal), it has now been revealed that they %0ahave always been fulfilling the Creator's will, to bring us (all our desires, %0aincluded) to perfection. %0a%0aThe same applies to every person in the world— whether he wants to or not, %0aat all times and in every way, he fulfills only the Creator's will. Why then is he %0anot called the Creator's servant? Because he acts unconsciously, not of his own %0awill. To compel man to fulfill His will, the Creator gives him some alien desire %0ato enjoy, which forces him to carry out an action, but he does so as a slave of his %0aand not as someone who fulfills the Creator's will. %0a%0aample, the Creator may give man an alien desire %0avpelling him to open a restaurant so as to carry out : %0aegoistic desire. %0a%0aIn other words, to compel us to do what is necessary, the Creator created %0awithin us an egoistic desire to receive pleasure, thus obliging us to do His will %0aby enabling us to find pleasure in the actions and objects on which He wants %0aus to work. This is why we live in constant chase of pleasures, whereas in truth %0aistantly and unconsciously fulfilling the Creator's will. This resembles %0awhich children are given many toys to play with, but as they play, %0avork. %0a%0arid is doing the Creator's will, but our goal, the pur %0alopment is to do it consciously. We must attain and realize His %0a%0a%0a%0a%0a. so as a slave of his %0a%0ae to make money, %0ait altruistic actions %0a%0a%0a%0a%0aAmong All the Sages, There Are None Like You %0a%0a%0a%0a345 %0a%0a%0a%0arather than as we do it now— unconsciously and coercively. We must achieve a %0astate when our desires fully coincide with those of the Creator, which designates %0a%0aThus, it becomes clear that the King of the nations of the world is the same %0aCreator that rules over them and compels them to fulfill all His desires, as a %0aKing does with his slaves. And now fear before the Creator is revealed to all %0athe nations of the world. The phrase, "all the nations of the world" alludes to %0athe angels that rule over those nations, such as Afriron, Kastimon, Aza, Azael %0aand others, from whom the sages of the nations of the world (our egoism and %0areason) receive their wisdom, and with whose help they oppress Israel (our %0aaltruistic desires). %0a%0aIN THEIR KINGDOMS refers to the four existing Kingdoms, which %0agovern the seventy nations of the world (ZON = seven Sefirot, each of which %0acontaining ten sub-Se/irot: in all seventy Sefirot) and over us (altruistic aspirations) %0ain our four exiles, which correspond to the impure Sefirot H-B-ZA-M (described %0aas Nebuchadnezzar). As the prophet writes: "Here is that idol, its head made %0aof pure gold (the first Kingdom), its breast and its arms of silver (the second %0aKingdom), its belly and its thighs of brass (the third Kingdom), its shins of iron, %0aits feet part iron and part clay (the fourth Kingdom)" (Daniel, 2:32-33). %0a%0aThere is not one among them who can make even the smallest action of %0atheir own, but only what You bid them. However, this will only be revealed at %0athe end of correction, and all will know that all of our misfortunes and suffering %0athat had the power to separate us from the Creator were but loyal executors of %0athe Creator's aspiration to draw us closer to Him. Moreover, these cruel forces %0adid nothing else but obey His orders. %0a%0aAnd the sole purpose of all that transpired was to bring us to a state where %0awe can receive all the perfection and infinite goodness that He intended to %0abestow upon us from the very beginning in His plan of creation. The Creator %0amust lead us to complete and devout faith, the result of which will be, as the %0aprophet said: "Then, at once, the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the %0agold all crumbled to pieces and became like the chaff on summer threshing- %0afloors; and the wind carried them away, and no trace was left of them; and the %0astone that smote their image became a great mountain, and filled the whole %0aearth" (Daniel, 2:35). %0a%0aAbsolute faith is called "unbreakable (non-crumbling) stone." After one %0amerits absolute faith, the impure force (his inner egoistic desires and thoughts) %0adisappears as though it had never existed. And all the worthless creatures %0a%0a%0a%0a346 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0a(reason, logic, philosophy, and common sense), which inhabit the earth, witness %0adeliverance at the hands of the Creator, as the prophet said: "They shall not %0ado evil nor destroy in all My holy mountain; for the earth shall be full of the %0aknowledge of the Lord, as the waters fill the sea" (Yeshayahu, 11:9). %0a%0a167. Yet, among all the sages of the nations of the world and in all their %0akingdoms, I have found in the ancient books that even though the Heavenly %0ahosts and legions fully obeyed their given orders and each would receive precise %0ainstructions to be carried out, but who among them can do it if not You, who %0awill do it better than You? For You excel over them all in both properties and %0adeeds. Hence, it is written: "There is none like You." %0a%0aitures' actions with His Light, %0ato His goal. Man's sole task is the realization of all creation ar %0a;rnance, to wholeheartedly agree with all of the Creator's actions, ar %0a%0a%0a%0a168. Rabbi Shimon said to his friends: "This wedding must be a wedding for %0aall of you, and each of you should bring a gift (his own part in the common %0aMalchut) to the Bride." He said to Rabbi Elazar, his son: "Present the Bride %0awith a gift, for on the following day Zeir Anpin will look as he enters the %0awedding canopy at the sound of these songs and praises of the sons of the %0awedding canopy, who stand before the Creator." %0a

Rabbi Elazar said, "It is written: 'Who would not fear the King of the %0a%3c nations of the world?' What kind of praise is this?" Rabbi Shimon replied: %0a%3c "Elazar, my son, this has been said in several places. However, one should %0a%3c not understand the verse, 'For among all the sages of the nations of the %0a%3c world, and in all their kingdoms, there are none like You' in its simple, literal %0a%3c interpretation. This is because it naturally gives rise to evil intentions of %0a%3c sinners— those who think that the Creator is not aware of their dark thoughts, %0a%3c doubts and intents. Therefore, their folly must be clarified. A philosopher %0a%3c of one of the nations of the world came to me and said, 'You say that your %0a%3c Creator governs the entire Heavens, and that all the Heavenly hosts are unable %0a%3c to attain Him, nor come to know His dwelling place. However, this does not %0a%3c add to His greatness, as it is written, 'among all the sages of the nations of %0a%3c the world, and in all their kingdoms, there is none like You.' What kind of a %0a%3c comparison is this when He is compared to man, who is nothing?'" %0a%3c %0a%3c This is similar to what is written about sinners in Psalms (Tehilim, 73:11-12): %0a%3c "And they say: 'How does the Creator know? And is there knowledge in Him? %0a%3c Behold the wicked; they are always at peace, rich and powerful.'" This is exactly %0a%3c what the philosopher says. He was one of the greatest sages among the nations of %0a%3c the world, and he came to Rabbi Shimon to dishonor Israel's wisdom and work %0a%3c in absolute faith for the Creator's sake, which ought to be in great wholeness, %0a%3c perfection, purity, and integrity, for no thought can grasp Him. %0a%3c %0a%3c This sage was a representative of the philosophers who asserted that the %0a%3c main principle in working for the Creator is to attain Him, rather than serve %0a%3c Him in faith, for in their understanding, they attain Him. And now he has %0a%3c come to ridicule Israel's approach. %0a%3c %0a%3c 337 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 338 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, he said: "The Creator is above all human wisdom, and thereby He %0a%3c rules, and He bid you to work for Him in faith and purity, and have no doubts in %0a%3c Him, for the human mind cannot grasp Him. After all, even the Heavenly hosts, %0a%3c His legions and angels are unable to attain Him, as it is written of those who say: %0a%3c 'Blessed be the Creator in His place,' for they do not know 'His place.'" %0a%3c %0a%3c However, the phrase, "as among all the sages of the world, there is none like %0a%3c the Creator" does not imply the Creator's greatness. Indeed, if this prophetic %0a%3c expression is used in order to exalt the God of Israel and show that He is greater %0a%3c than the god attained by the sages of the nations of the world by their human %0a%3c strength and reason, then naturally, this does not add to the glory of the God of %0a%3c Israel, as He is being compared to trifle and transient forces. On the contrary, %0a%3c this statement shows great disdain for your Creator, when you compare Him to %0a%3c the sages of the nations of the world, who are mortal and restricted creatures. %0a%3c Those were the words that the scholarly sage, who represented the wisdom of %0a%3c the nations of the world, uttered before Rabbi Shimon. %0a%3c %0a%3c Clearly, The Zohar is referring to some overseas sage who paid a visit to Rabbi %0a%3c Shimon. Just like all the other names of places and characters mentioned in the %0a%3c Torah, the Talmud, and the Kabbalah, names of places, animals, people, and %0a%3c actions described in The Zohar speak only of the spiritual world, the Creator's %0a%3c actions, and how one can achieve the goal of creation. In no way does any of this %0a%3c relate to events in our world! %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, the "sage of the nations of the world" symbolizes man's own %0a%3c egoistic property to research and know everything, instead of having faith above %0a%3c reason, as the Torah demands. This human property, called a "sage of the %0a%3c nations of the world," the egoistic reason, is in a state of constant argument %0a%3c with man's spiritual, altruistic property, called "Israel" or the aspiration to the %0a%3c Creator. Thus, by opposing it, man builds himself and grows. %0a%3c %0a%3c 162. Furthermore, you claim, as your Torah says, that "There had not risen %0a%3c a prophet since in Israel like Moshe." There are none in Israel, but there is %0a%3c one among the nations of the world! So I claim the same: there is none like %0a%3c You among all the sages of the nations of the world, but among the sages of %0a%3c Israel there is one like You. However, if there is one like Him among the sages %0a%3c of Israel, then He cannot be the Supreme Ruler. Look closely into my words, %0a%3c and you shall see that I am right. %0a%3c %0a%3c Here the philosopher (man's egoistic voice) spoke wisely. He understood %0a%3c that should he speak directly, he would hear precise answers to his questions. It %0a%3c is written: "Among all the sages of the nations of the world, there are none like %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Among All the Sages, There Are None Like You 339 %0a%3c %0a%3c You," meaning that there is no one that can attain You. For the words, "there %0a%3c are none like You" imply that You have no equals, that it is impossible to attain %0a%3c You, attain Your degree. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, since the sages of the nations of the world (human reason) take %0a%3c pride in their attainment of the Creator (that they understand His intentions %0a%3c and actions), they consider themselves similar to Him, for attainment means %0a%3c similarity of properties with the attained degree. This is why it is considered a %0a%3c lie, and that there are none like Him, for they do not attain the Creator, but %0a%3c only delude themselves by thinking that they do. %0a%3c %0a%3c The philosopher (within man) understood that, and hence began (leading %0a%3c man astray from the path of faith, which surpasses and defies reason) with a %0a%3c completely different question: "If it is explicitly said that no one is equal to the %0a%3c Creator among the sages of the other nations, does it not mean that there are %0a%3c those who can attain Him among the sages of Israel? Otherwise, why would it be %0a%3c necessary to specify that there are none like Him among the sages of the nations %0a%3c of the world? %0a%3c %0a%3c "But if this is so, and He is similar to you, then He cannot be the Supreme %0a%3c Ruler! Thus, how can you say that the God of Israel cannot be attained by %0a%3c reason and that He governs all? You speak by means of faith in His greatness, %0a%3c but indeed there are those among your sages who are like Him, i.e., those who %0a%3c attain Him." %0a%3c %0a%3c 163. Rabbi Shimon said to him, "You object correctly that there are those %0a%3c among the sages of Israel who are similar to the Creator, for who resurrects %0a%3c the dead back to life, if not the Creator Himself? Yet, Eliyahu and Elisha %0a%3c came and resurrected the dead back to life! Who causes rain to fall if not the %0a%3c Creator Himself? Yet, Eliyahu came and abolished rain, and then summoned %0a%3c it through his prayer! Who created the Heavens and the earth, if not the %0a%3c Creator Himself? Yet, Avraham came, and, as it is written, the Heavens and %0a%3c the earth were revived." %0a%3c %0a%3c Rabbi Shimon replies that the (inner) sage speaks the truth when he %0a%3c asserts that there are those among the sages of Israel who are similar to the %0a%3c Creator. However, in no way does this revoke the simple faith in the Creator's %0a%3c unattainability by human reason. Of course, He is the master and ruler of the %0a%3c Heavens, and He is so much higher than all of them that even the Supernal %0a%3c angels cannot attain Him and do not know His place. %0a%3c %0a%3c Yet, the Torah and Mitzvot (commandments) were given to us precisely for %0a%3c this purpose— so that by observing the Mitzvot (making a Zivug between the screen %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 340 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c and the Light) and studying the Torah (receiving the Light) for the Creator's %0a%3c sake, we, Israel (those who aspire to the Creator) would completely merge with %0a%3c Him (in our properties), so His Light would permeate us and clothe in us to %0a%3c such an extent that we would merit (begin to desire and receive the power of %0a%3c a screen) carrying out the same actions as the Creator: resurrecting the dead %0a%3c (correcting egoism), summoning rains (Ohr Hassadim), and reviving Heaven and %0a%3c earth (filling all the Partzufim in all the worlds with the Light of our actions). %0a%3c %0a%3c In that, we are just like Him, as it is said: "By Your deeds (by experiencing %0a%3c them on myself) I will know You." However, we attain all this only through %0a%3c absolute and devout faith (the property of Bind), which leaves within us no %0a%3c desires whatsoever to attain Him with our reason (to verify first and act next), %0a%3c as in the path of sages of the nations of the world (our egoism). Our egoism %0a%3c consists of a Partzuf called a "sage of the nations of the world." Its Rosh (head) %0a%3c designates knowledge and desire to attain everything, and its Guf (body) is the %0a%3c will to receive pleasure for oneself. %0a%3c %0a%3c The philosopher argues that if Israel can do what the Creator does, then %0a%3c Israel attains Him. This is correct, for if one is able to act like the Creator, then, %0a%3c to the extent of his actions, he attains and perceives Him. After all, it is said: "By %0a%3c Your deeds I will know You." If one acts like the Creator, then he understands %0a%3c the Creator's analogous actions in his own actions, and thus perceives Him. %0a%3c However, one must first advance by faith above reason, and as a result, he attains %0a%3c the Creator's properties, thereby becoming like Him in his actions. %0a%3c %0a%3c 164. (Rabbi Shimon continues:) "Who governs the sun, if not the Creator? %0a%3c Yet, Yehoshua came and stopped it. The Creator issues His decree, yet Moshe %0a%3c immediately issues a decree of his own, and it is carried out. The Creator wishes %0a%3c to punish, and the righteous of Israel annul His verdict. Moreover, He bid us %0a%3c to closely follow His ways and to be like Him in every way." The philosopher %0a%3c then went and became Israel, and lived in the village of Shachalayim, and they %0a%3c called him Yosi HaKatan (Little Yosi). He studied the Torah a great deal, and %0a%3c was among the sages and the righteous of that village. %0a%3c %0a%3c The problem is that if a person does everything only by means of his faith, %0a%3c he denies himself the chance to attain the Creator, for attainment comes %0a%3c through applying reason. However, the moment he begins to apply his reason, he %0a%3c immediately diminishes his faith. So how can one combine faith with reason? %0a%3c %0a%3c It is true that those who aspire to draw nearer the Creator (those who are %0a%3c called Israel) diminish their simple, devout faith. However, they do this only %0a%3c because He bids them to do so in order to attain His actions, and thus become %0a%3c like Him, as it is said in the Torah: "Follow His way" (Devarim, 21). Hence, %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Among All the Sages, There Are None Like You 341 %0a%3c %0a%3c they observe His commandments. The philosopher was so overwhelmed by this %0a%3c truth that he became "Israel" and started observing the Torah and Mitzvot. %0a%3c %0a%3c He was overwhelmed when he had found that Israel's actions, their %0a%3c attainments of the spiritual worlds, did not diminish their faith above reason, for %0a%3c all of their actions and attainments were based on faith. Israel attains the Creator %0a%3c because He bids them to, not because they desire this with their egoism. %0a%3c %0a%3c 165. And now the time has come to take a closer look at this verse. It is %0a%3c written that all the nations of the world are nothing before Him. Yet, how %0a%3c does this exalt Him? Hence, it is written: "Who sees the King of the nations %0a%3c of the world?" Yet, is the King of the nations of the world also not the King of %0a%3c Israel? The Creator wishes to elevate Israel in all places; this is why He is called %0a%3c everywhere "the King of Israel." The other nations of the world say that they %0a%3c have another King up in the Heavens, for it seems to them that He governs %0a%3c only them, and not us. %0a%3c %0a%3c The nations of the world are certain that their Supernal King is not the %0a%3c King of Israel, that the King who sits in the Heavens and governs them is %0a%3c only their King, and that the King of Israel has no power over them. Thus, it %0a%3c seems to man's egoism that it exists under some other (non-altruistic) system of %0a%3c governance, and not altruism. The egoism fails to realize that the Creator made %0a%3c it exactly the way it is so as to achieve His goal: using egoism, to bring man to %0a%3c altruism, from "for one's own self to "for the Creator's sake." %0a%3c %0a%3c 166. It is written: "Who would not fear the King of the nations of the world?" %0a%3c (Xirmiyahu, 10:7) That is, their Supernal King is there to threaten and %0a%3c persecute them, and do with them as He pleases. Hence, He should be feared. %0a%3c And all fear Him Above and below. For it is written that among all the sages of %0a%3c the nations of the world (the angels that rule over these nations) and in their %0a%3c Kingdoms (Above) there is none like You. There are four Kingdoms Above %0a%3c that rule over all the nations of the world according to the Creator's will. And %0a%3c there is no one who can do even the smallest action without His personal %0a%3c instruction. The sages of the nations of the world are the forces that rule them %0a%3c from Above, and all the wisdom of the nations of the world comes from these %0a%3c rulers. "In all their Kingdoms" means that the Creator's will rules over them. %0a%3c %0a%3c These lines describe how the bride, who is in a state of exile, prepares herself %0a%3c for her future, final correction. The power of the nations of the world (in every %0a%3c one of us) amounts to conquering us (the altruistic desires for the Creator) and %0a%3c placing us under their power (serving only the body). They wish to drive us away %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 342 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c from the Creator's rule and let other desires, called "the nations of the world" %0a%3c dominate us. Our egoistic desires, the nations of the world, do so because of %0a%3c their power (tempting us with various pleasures) and wisdom (appealing to our %0a%3c common sense). %0a%3c %0a%3c Their actions over us (spiritual aspirations) stem from the system of the %0a%3c impure forces and their impure (egoistic) angels (our inner egoistic forces), %0a%3c which give power and reason to the nations of the world. With the help of %0a%3c their wisdom, they (our egoistic desires) lead us (the sons of Israel, those who %0a%3c aspire only to the Creator) to all sorts of doubts and desires to understand %0a%3c the Creator, His ways and thoughts, without any fear or reverence before His %0a%3c greatness and supremacy. %0a%3c %0a%3c Because of these doubts, we draw far from the Creator and His Supernal %0a%3c Light, which, as a result, passes on to them (our egoistic desires), as it is %0a%3c written, "Tzur (the capital of the impure forces) was built only on the ruins of %0a%3c Jerusalem (the capital of the pure forces)." Thus, they acquire the strength to %0a%3c persecute and humiliate Israel, and force them to submit to their will (suppress %0a%3c the only true path to the spiritual— faith above and in defiance of reason— with %0a%3c their persuasions and proof of their "real" rightfulness). And as it was already %0a%3c explained in the "Introduction to the Book of Zohar" (items 69-71), our inner %0a%3c spiritual enslavement leads to our external, corporeal enslavement, persecution, %0a%3c and humiliation by the nations of the world. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is the secret of the four Kingdoms that rule over us in our four (spiritual %0a%3c and therefore physical) exiles, which correspond to Sefirot H-B-ZA-M, symbolized %0a%3c by Nebuchadnezzar, as it is written: "Here is that idol, its head made of pure %0a%3c gold, its breast and its arms of silver, its belly and its thighs of brass, its shins of %0a%3c iron, and its feet part iron and part clay" (Daniel, 2:32-33). %0a%3c %0a%3c When this idol governs us, the nations of the world mock us, claiming %0a%3c that they have a King of their own. However, such was the Creator's plan, as %0a%3c it is said: "The Creator hath so made it, that men should fear Him" (Kohelet, %0a%3c 3:14), for the sensation of the Creator, called Shechina, is also referred to as fear %0a%3c before Him. However, since we do not yet feel the greatness and supremacy of %0a%3c the Creator, we do not merit fearing Him, and live in fear of the King of the %0a%3c nations of the world. %0a%3c %0a%3c This points to the fact that we have no other way of completely and eternally %0a%3c merging with the Creator other than by means of tremendous fear before His %0a%3c greatness, by assuming His Torah and His desires (Mitzvot) in devout and %0a%3c complete faith, without any doubts in His properties. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Among All the Sages, There Are None Like You %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 343 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Only then will we merge with Him in absolute, eternal union, and the %0a%3c Creator will impart us with all the goodness for which He had created us. He %0a%3c conceived this in the beginning of creation, and it became the purpose behind %0a%3c the whole of creation. This state is considered the complete and final deliverance %0a%3c and correction. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, before the attainment of such an exalted spiritual state, this is how %0a%3c the prophet describes those who aspire to the Creator: "You have sown much, %0a%3c and brought in little; you eat but you have not enough; you drink but your thirst %0a%3c is not quenched" (Haggai, 1:6), for in all of our actions (of those who aspire to %0a%3c the spiritual) the impure force (egoism) constantly takes all the Light for itself. %0a%3c This occurs as a result of our doubts with regard to faith in the Creator, which %0a%3c the impure force itself cultivates within us. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, the purpose of these punishments is not to cause us grief! Everything %0a%3c happens according to the Creator's plan and serves only to promote us toward %0a%3c correction. Therefore, as long as man can listen only to egoistic arguments, the %0a%3c Creator develops us gradually, using these forces. With their help, we gradually %0a%3c become fit to feel fear of the Creator, through the many trials and sufferings our %0a%3c %0a%3c But in the end, we merit the reception of complete and devoted faith and fear %0a%3c before His greatness. It is written of this state: "He remembered His mercy and His %0a%3c allegiance toward the house of Israel, and all the worthless creatures of the earth %0a%3c witnessed the help and deliverance at the Creator's hands" (Tehilim, 98:3). %0a%3c %0a%3c This is because at the end of days, the Creator will remember us in His %0a%3c mercy, and will give us the strength to receive complete and devout faith in Him. %0a%3c Thus, Jerusalem (the capital of altruism) will be rebuilt on the ruins of Tzur %0a%3c (the capital of egoism), for all the Light, which Malchut of the impure force was %0a%3c robbing of us throughout our exile from the spiritual, will return to us when we %0a%3c acquire complete and devout faith, and will shine within us with all its might. %0a%3c %0a%3c All the worthless creatures of the earth (manifestations of egoism) will then %0a%3c see with their own eyes how our Creator saves (corrects) them. For all the nations %0a%3c of the world (within us) will see that they have always possessed this Light until %0a%3c the very last moment before their correction so as to give it back to us at the %0a%3c appropriate time. And all shall see that "one man's rule over another is to the %0a%3c detriment of the ruler!" (Kohelet, 8:9). %0a%3c %0a%3c The burden of our slavery and the impure force's rule over us (over holiness) %0a%3c harms only the impure force, for it thereby compels us to attain complete and %0a%3c devoted faith in the Creator even faster! And the prophet speaks of this time, %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 344 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c At they %0a%3c „He m %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c "Who would not fear the King of the nations of the world?" for it has now been %0a%3c revealed that He is the King of the nations of the world, who persecutes and %0a%3c dominates those nations. It previously seemed to them (our egoistic intentions) %0a%3c that they persecuted us (our altruistic intentions), but now the opposite has %0a%3c been revealed to them— that they were merely blind enactors of the Creator's %0a%3c will, our servants and our slaves, whose purpose is to bring us to perfection. %0a%3c %0a%3c It seemed to us that they were beating us. Now it turns out that they were beat- %0a%3c ; themselves, for thanks to these blows (suffering from unrealized egoistic desires %0a%3c it frustration), they have accelerated our deliverance and attainr %0a%3c )ur realization of the need to choose the path of faith above re %0a%3c have also accelerated their own demise (their own correctior %0a%3c %0a%3c And wherever it seemed to us (our reason) that they rebelled against the %0a%3c Creator (argued that the Creator is not the source of all reality) and acted %0a%3c (supposedly) however they pleased so as to humiliate us and satiate their base %0a%3c egoistic desires, and it appeared that there was no (Supernal) judge and no law %0a%3c (the advancement of creation toward its goal), it has now been revealed that they %0a%3c have always been fulfilling the Creator's will, to bring us (all our desires, %0a%3c included) to perfection. %0a%3c %0a%3c The same applies to every person in the world— whether he wants to or not, %0a%3c at all times and in every way, he fulfills only the Creator's will. Why then is he %0a%3c not called the Creator's servant? Because he acts unconsciously, not of his own %0a%3c will. To compel man to fulfill His will, the Creator gives him some alien desire %0a%3c to enjoy, which forces him to carry out an action, but he does so as a slave of his %0a%3c and not as someone who fulfills the Creator's will. %0a%3c %0a%3c ample, the Creator may give man an alien desire %0a%3c vpelling him to open a restaurant so as to carry out : %0a%3c egoistic desire. %0a%3c %0a%3c In other words, to compel us to do what is necessary, the Creator created %0a%3c within us an egoistic desire to receive pleasure, thus obliging us to do His will %0a%3c by enabling us to find pleasure in the actions and objects on which He wants %0a%3c us to work. This is why we live in constant chase of pleasures, whereas in truth %0a%3c istantly and unconsciously fulfilling the Creator's will. This resembles %0a%3c which children are given many toys to play with, but as they play, %0a%3c vork. %0a%3c %0a%3c rid is doing the Creator's will, but our goal, the pur %0a%3c lopment is to do it consciously. We must attain and realize His %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c . so as a slave of his %0a%3c %0a%3c e to make money, %0a%3c it altruistic actions %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Among All the Sages, There Are None Like You %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 345 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c rather than as we do it now— unconsciously and coercively. We must achieve a %0a%3c state when our desires fully coincide with those of the Creator, which designates %0a%3c %0a%3c Thus, it becomes clear that the King of the nations of the world is the same %0a%3c Creator that rules over them and compels them to fulfill all His desires, as a %0a%3c King does with his slaves. And now fear before the Creator is revealed to all %0a%3c the nations of the world. The phrase, "all the nations of the world" alludes to %0a%3c the angels that rule over those nations, such as Afriron, Kastimon, Aza, Azael %0a%3c and others, from whom the sages of the nations of the world (our egoism and %0a%3c reason) receive their wisdom, and with whose help they oppress Israel (our %0a%3c altruistic desires). %0a%3c %0a%3c IN THEIR KINGDOMS refers to the four existing Kingdoms, which %0a%3c govern the seventy nations of the world (ZON = seven Sefirot, each of which %0a%3c containing ten sub-Se/irot: in all seventy Sefirot) and over us (altruistic aspirations) %0a%3c in our four exiles, which correspond to the impure Sefirot H-B-ZA-M (described %0a%3c as Nebuchadnezzar). As the prophet writes: "Here is that idol, its head made %0a%3c of pure gold (the first Kingdom), its breast and its arms of silver (the second %0a%3c Kingdom), its belly and its thighs of brass (the third Kingdom), its shins of iron, %0a%3c its feet part iron and part clay (the fourth Kingdom)" (Daniel, 2:32-33). %0a%3c %0a%3c There is not one among them who can make even the smallest action of %0a%3c their own, but only what You bid them. However, this will only be revealed at %0a%3c the end of correction, and all will know that all of our misfortunes and suffering %0a%3c that had the power to separate us from the Creator were but loyal executors of %0a%3c the Creator's aspiration to draw us closer to Him. Moreover, these cruel forces %0a%3c did nothing else but obey His orders. %0a%3c %0a%3c And the sole purpose of all that transpired was to bring us to a state where %0a%3c we can receive all the perfection and infinite goodness that He intended to %0a%3c bestow upon us from the very beginning in His plan of creation. The Creator %0a%3c must lead us to complete and devout faith, the result of which will be, as the %0a%3c prophet said: "Then, at once, the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the %0a%3c gold all crumbled to pieces and became like the chaff on summer threshing- %0a%3c floors; and the wind carried them away, and no trace was left of them; and the %0a%3c stone that smote their image became a great mountain, and filled the whole %0a%3c earth" (Daniel, 2:35). %0a%3c %0a%3c Absolute faith is called "unbreakable (non-crumbling) stone."
