csum=Vertigo is a sensation that things are moving or your vision is spinning when it really isn't. Bacteria infection is the cause.[[https://www.icnr.com/vertigo/vertigo-and-cytomegalovirus.html|#]].  Likely culprits are [[stenotrophomonas]] or [[pseudomonas]] (both of which can be killed with [[cinnamon]]) or [[campylobacter]] which can be fought with [[ginger]].  [[pseudomonas]] can be a cause of vertigo (and likely also [[stentrophommonas]] which is the [[glaucoma]] bacteria) both can be combated with [[ginko biloba]].  Also [[cinnamon]] fights that.  [[Campylobacter]] can also cause vertigo and also [[brain zaps]], [[ginger]] treats that cause.
