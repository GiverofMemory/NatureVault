What really happened is the partial freezing expanded the liquid leading to forced pressurization.  The colder the liquid, the more [[CO2]] can dissolve in the liquid which is a double whammy. To truly recreate true champagne you want to partially freeze the bottles then let them thaw multiple times recreating years of cold winters.  To do this you can pack the bottles in ice or snow with some salt then remove them immediatly when it just starts to freeze.  Another way is put them outside when the temp is 32f for several hours, enough to start freezing but not enough to freeze solid and break the bottles.
