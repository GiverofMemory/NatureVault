I believe dominion was making hints that they could win the election for the right price.  I think the hints were lost on Podesta.%0a%0aConspiracy to gaslight and groom the public to prevent uprising from a stolen election [[https://time.com/5936036/secret-2020-election-campaign/|#]] [[https://unlimitedhangout.com/2020/01/investigative-series/how-government-and-media-are-prepping-america-for-a-failed-2020-election/|#]].%0a%0a!!The Big Rig%0a%0aSo after many hours of research I think I have **Dominion's** vote rigging system decoded.  This is a running {+Theory/Hypothesis+}, each belief has some {+facts and speculation+}.  This is //**my read of the situation**// I am pretty confident in as a whole.%0a%0a#  Contact the candidates campaigns.  Possibly get contributions for "doing everything they can" to improve their chances.  Sell "packages" of how much they want to sway the election.%0a%0a#  Program the software (whether on the machines or on the SD/CF card that contains portable software for the machine) to flip 1%25 of votes, 2%25, 3%25, etc depending on the "contribution level" that the campaign made to Dominion linked corporations or charities.  This flip immediately effects the printed ticker as the voting is happening.%0a%0a#  Send technicians to "update" the machines which will run SQL queries to perform the flip at the software database level.  This may also be able to be done remotely.  Now both the paper ticker and the software will be aligned.%0a%0a#  Officials now can see the discrepancy.  Lets say there were 1000 votes and 1%25 were flipped.  This means 10 purple votes now become green.  Working deep into the night 10 purple ballots are removed from the physical ballot storage and set aside to be destroyed, they are labeled as "[[https://ballotpedia.org/Spoiled_ballot|Spoiled ballots]]" [[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=NMQClZPat5c|#]]. Next they place an order with the dominion tech to deposit 10 fraudulent green ballots into the late night drop boxes.  This way the paper ballots can be flipped as well.%0a%0a!!!How to detect the fraud%0a%0aSince apparently Dominion has covered all tracks; from the printed ticker, to the database in the machine, to the physical ballots themselves, a few things can be done to root out the fraud.%0a%0a*Physical ballot measures.  Everything from checking signatures, to making sure the ballots filled out all races and not just presidential, to making sure that they were hand marked and not machine marked can help.  Also having the ballot blanks under strict control and production by the state so that a corporation cannot just manufacture more at will is needed.  If strict control of production is done, then measures like holograms and watermarks etc can help verify authenticity.  However if you allow a 3rd party to make the ballots, no matter what anti-fraud measures are imposed it doesn't matter because the 3rd party can just make more at will.%0a%0a*Digital audits.  Digital audits need to look for things like unauthorized SQL software that could be used to edit the machine counts, internet/remote access, administrator logins from technicians, etc.  The software running the machine, whether internal or portable, needs to be fully reviewed.%0a%0a*Statistical anomalies.  Ballot dumps would require all or most of the votes in a certain batch to be for one candidate.%0a%0a*Review official and unofficial communication between candidates, the campaigns, and Dominion or Dominion linked entities.  Review contribution from campaigns to Dominion linked entities.%0a!!!How to prevent the fraud%0a%0a*Ballots can only be printed by the state, an exact amount made, and the machinery used to produce them under constant watch and chain of custody, then destroyed after the prescribed amount of ballots produced.  Ample anti-fraud measures like color changing ink, watermarks, raised stamps, special paper, and holograms should be used.%0a%0a*Counts done 100%25 by hand bi-partisan and every ballot photographed and both physically and digitally stored for a minimum of 10 years under constant supervision and chain of custody.%0a%0a*Open audits to any person or group for a reasonable cost for oversight of the audit.%0a%0a*No votes shall be done remotely.  If someone cannot show up to vote for whatever reason, they can get an affidavit notarized by the state for a named person to vote in their place on voting day.  If the remotely represented voter dies or moves jurisdictions before the ballot is cast in person, then the vote is nullified and not counted.%0a%0a*Receipts/QR codes on the ballots that the voter can access a unique web site where both a picture of their ballot is hosted for 2+ years after the election and whether the ballot was accepted or not and why.%0a%0a!!!How to improve elections%0a%0aIt is one thing to remove fraud but an entirely another thing to improve elections.%0a%0a*Look into blockchain technology including creating "proof of personhood" tokens that reside on blockchains for voting.%0a%0a*Ranked Choice Voting%0a%0a*giving all candidates television/media time and/or other things to remove the effect of big money donors.  The best way to remove money from politics is to remove the requirement of money to run a campaign.%0a%0a!!Quadrilemma of voting - TAPS%0a%0aQuadrilemma's usually are a "pick 3" situation but we will always optimize all three.%0a%0a#Transparency - Ensure that the results of the election (full election, and whether or not their own personal vote counted) can be verified by each person who desires to.%0a%0a#Accessibility - Ensure that every eligible voter has the technical ability and convenience to vote.%0a%0a#Privacy - Ensure that each voter's privacy is secure from both other people and groups and also the government itself.%0a%0a#Security - Ensure that each voter is eligible and that each eligible voter can only vote once.

Everything from checking signatures, to making sure the ballots filled out all races and not just presidential, to making sure that they were hand marked and not machine marked can help.  Also having the ballot blanks under strict control and production by the state so that a corporation cannot just manufacture more at will is needed.  If strict control of production is done, then measures like holograms and watermarks etc can help verify authenticity.  However if you allow a 3rd party to make the ballots, no matter what anti-fraud measures are imposed it doesn't matter because the 3rd party can just make more at will.%0a%3c %0a%3c *Digital audits.  Digital audits need to look for things like unauthorized SQL software that could be used to edit the machine counts, internet/remote access, administrator logins from technicians, etc.  The software running the machine, whether internal or portable, needs to be fully reviewed.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!How to prevent the fraud%0a%3c %0a%3c *Ballots can only be printed by the state, an exact amount made, and the machinery used to produce them then destroyed.
