csum=#To prepare plots a couple methods can be used, the less invasive the better.  Double digging can be used but should only be done for the first couple years as needed.  Primarily soil would be minimally disturbed and compost and plant material added in large amounts to create humus rich topsoil over time.  No till &gt; manual till (hoe) &gt; slow till.  The more manual and slower the tilling, the less damage to beneficial worms and also other insect larvae like fireflies and others.  Eventually the biointensive plots will be rich and loose enough to not require turning the soil at all.  #Genetics should be wild, native, naturalized, landrace, and heirloom, in that order of importance.  #In practice biointensive plots will usually be annual crops as this allows for simpler maintainance and management of the plots, however biointensive is also probably the best method for perennial crops as well.  Perennial crop management is just more complicated to manage since you can't do much to the plots from year to year.
