I have been ever since perpetually %0adazzled, continually honouing and pions Bia that day, in which I pre- %0asented mysclf before it, as before a singular and humane Majesty. Now %0asecking after some occasion whereby I might make appcar the goodness and %0asincerity of my heart and extend my acquaintance toward your most %0aexccllont Majesty, and secing that it was impossible for me to declare it %0aby effects, as well as because of the darkness and obscurity of my mind, %0aeven for the enlightening it did receive from the face of the greatest %0aMonarch in the world, ft was a great while before I could resolve to %0awhom I should dedicate these three lasf Conturies of my Prophecies, which %0amake the complete thousand, After I had a long time considered, 1 %0ahave with a great temerity made my address to your Majesty, being no %0away daunted by it, as the great author Plutarch related in the Life of %0aLycurgus, that, sceing the offerings and gifts that were sacrificed in the %0atemples of their heathen gods, many came no more, lest the people should %0awonder at the expense. %0a%0aNotwithstanding, sceing your royal splendor joined with an incomparable %0ahumanity, I have made my address to it, not as to the Kings of Persia, of %0a%0a%0aThis cedicatory Ictter was used by Nostradamus as the preface to his second edition %0awhich contained new prophecies. %0a%0aThe following notation appeared, on the page preceding the above epistle, in the %0a1672 edition of ‘I'he Prophecies or Prognostications of Michacl Nostradamus, translated %0aand annotated by Theophilus de Garencicres, %0a%0a%0aFriendly Reader, %0aBefore you rend the following epistle, I would have you be warmed of n few things: %0a%0a%0aOne is, that according to-m u Li %0aplaces, being without any hist connection, and besides thé” obscurily of the sense, %0athe crabbedness of the expression is such, that had not the importunity of the Book- %0aseller prevailed, 1 would have left it out, but gee agoiel the respect due to Antiquity, %0athe satisfaction we owe to curious persons, who would perhaps lave thought the %0aBook imperfect without it, we let it go, trusting to your candor and ingenuity, %0a%0a231 %0a%0a%0aopinion, it is very obscure and intelligible (sic) in most 3 %0a%0a%0a232 VOMELETE PROTHEGIES OF NOSTRADAMUS %0a%0a%0awhom to come near it was forbidden, but as to a most prudent and wise %0aprince. Lhave dedicaled my nocturnal and prophctical calculations, written %0arather by a natural instinct and poetical furor than by any rules of poctry; %0aand the most part of ik written and agreeing with the years, months and %0a- weeks, of the regions, countries and most of the towns and cities in %0aEurope; touching also something of AGica, and of a part of Asia, by the %0achange of regions that come near 10 those climates, and compounded in %0aa natural fashion. But some may answer (who hath need lo blow his %0a_ nose) that the rhyme is as casy to be understood, as the sense is hard to %0aget at, ‘Iherefore, O most humane King, most of the prophetical stanzas %0aare so difficult, that there is no way to be found for the interpretation %0aof them, Nevertheless, being in hope of setting down the towns, cities, %0aand regions, wherein most of those shall happen, especially in the year %0a158s, and in the year 1606, beginning from this present time, which is the %0asath of March, 1557. ; ; %0aGoing further to the fulfilling of those things, which shall be in the %0abeginning of the seventh milleuary, according to my astronomical caleula- %0ation and other learning which I could reach fat which time the adversaries %0aof Christ and of Tis Church shall begin to multiply), alt has been com. %0aposed and calculated in days and hours of election, and well disposed, %0aand all as accurately as was possible for me to do, And the whole “Minerva %0alibera et non invita,” * calculating almost as much of the time that is %0acome, as of that which is past, comprehending it in the present time, and %0awhat by the course of the said time shall be known to happen in al %0aregions punctually as tt is here written, adding nothing superfluous, although %0ait be said “Quod de futuris non ost cleterninala omnina veritas” ** Te is %0avery true, Sit, that by my natural instinct given me hy my progenitors, J %0adid think T could foretell anything; but having made an agreement %0abetween this said inslinct of ming, and a long calculation of “art, and %0aby a great tranquility and repose of mind, by cemplying my soul of all %0acare, T have foretold most part of these ex tripade neo (hy the brass %0atripod), though there he many who attribute to me some things that %0aare no more mine than what Is nothing at all, Only the eternal God, %0awho is the scarcher of men’s hearts, being pious, just, and merciful, is the %0atrue Judge of it; Tim I beseech to defend me from the calumny of %0awicked men, who would as willingly question how all your ancient pro- %0agenitors, the Kings of Mrance, have healed the discase called the Kings %0acvil; how some other nations have cured the biting of venomous beasts; %0aothers have had a certain instinct to foretell things that are to come, %0aand of others too tedious to be here inserted, Notwithstanding those in %0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a* When Minerva was frea and favorable.” %0a** “There can bo no truth entirely determined for certain which concerns the future," %0a%0a%0aEPISYLE TO VENRY IN 233 %0a%0a%0awhom the malignancy of the wicked spirit shall not be suppressed by %0alength of time, I hope that after my decease my work shall be in more %0aesteem than when I was alive, %0a%0aHowever, if I should fail in the. calculation of times, or should not %0aplease some, may it please your most imperial Majesty to forgive me, %0aprotesting before Go and Lis Saints, that I do not intend to insert %0aanything in writing in this present Epistle that ay be contrary to the true %0aCatholic faith, while consulting the astronomical calculations, according %0ato my leatning. For the space of times of. our fathers that have becn before %0aus are such, submitting mysclf to the correction of the most learned, that %0athe first man Adam was before Noah, about one thousand two hundred %0aand forty-two years, not computing the time according to the Gentile %0arecords, as Varro did, but only according to the Sacred Scriptures, taking %0athem as a guide to my astronomical calculations, and to the best of my %0aunderstanding. After Noah and the universal flood, about a thousand %0aand fourscore years, came Abraham, who was a supreme astrologer, accord- %0aing to most men’s opinion, and did first invent the Chaldean letters; after %0athat came Moses, some five hundred and fifteen or sixteen years after, %0aAnd between the time of David and Moses there passed about five hun- %0adred and seventy years. After which, between the time of David and that %0aof our Saviour and Redeemer Jesus Christ, born of the Virgin Mary, there %0ahhegs (according to some chronographers) a thousand three hundred and ' %0a%0aty years, %0a%0asone may object, that this calculation is not true; because it differs %0afrom that of Eusebius, And from the time of human redemption, to that %0aof the exccrable seduction of the Saracens, have passed six hundred and %0afour and twenty years or thereabouts, From that time hitherto, it is %0aeasy to gather what times are past. If me roby Bure be not good amon %0aall nations, however, all has becn calculated by the course of the solestiel %0abodies joined with emotion infused in me at certain loose hours, the %0aemotion which has been handed down to me by my ancient progenitors, %0aBut the danger at this time (most execllent King) requires that such %0asceret events should not be manifested except by an cnigmatical sentence, %0ahaying but one sense and only one intelligence, without having mixed %0awith it any ambiguous or amphibological calculation, But rather under %0aa cloudy obscurity, through a natural infusion, coming near to the'sentence %0aof one of the thousand and two Prophets, that have been since the Creation %0aof the world, according to the calculation and Punic Chronicle of Joel: %0a“Effundum spititum meum super omnem ¢carnem, et prophetabunt filit %0avestri, et filiae vestrae.” * But such a prophecy did proceed from the mouth %0aof the Holy Spirit, who was the supreme and eternal power, which being %0a%0a%0a* Seo Joel ii.28, %0a%0a%0aA3dq COMPLETE PROPHECIES OF NOSTRADAMUS %0a%0a%0acome with that of the cclestial bodies, has caused some of them to predict %0agreat and wonderful things. %0a%0aVor my part I challenge no such thing in this place, God forbid. I %0aconfess Luly, that all comes from God, lor which I give Him thanks, %0ahonor, and praise, without having mixed aiylhing of that divination which %0aprocecds 3 Fie but 4 Deo, d natura (which proceeds from fate, but from %0aGod, and nature). And most of it is joined with the motion aud course %0aof the celestial bodies, much as if seeing in a lens, and through a cloudy %0avision, the great and sad cvents, the prodigious and calamitous accidents %0athat shall befall the worshippers. First upon the temples of God, and %0asecondly upon those who draw their support from carth, this draws near, %0awith a thousand other calamitous accidents, which shall be known in the %0acourse of time. %0a%0aFor God will take notice of the long barrenness of the great Dame, %0awho afterwards shall conceive two ase By children, But, being in danger, %0ashe will give birth with risk at her age of death in the eighteenth year, and %0anot able to go beyond thirly-six, shall leave behind her three males and %0aone female, and he will have two who never had any of the same father, %0aThe differences between the three brothers shall be such, though united %0aand agreed, that the three and four parts of Murope will tremble, By the %0alesser in years shall the Christian monarchy be upheld and augmented; %0asects shall rise and presently be put down again; the Arabians shall be put %0aback; kingdoms shall be united and new laws made. Concerning the other %0achildren, the first shall possess the furious crowned Lions, holding their %0apaws upon the escutchcons, The second, well attended by the Latins, %0awill go so deep among the Lions, that a second trembling and furious %0adescent will be made, to get upon the Pyrenees Mountains. ‘Che ancfent %0amonarchy shall not be transferred, and the third inundation of human %0ablood shall happen; also for a good while Mars shall not be in Lent, %0a%0aThe daughter shall be given for the preservalion of the Church, the %0adominator of it falling into the Pagan sect of the new unbelievers, and %0ashe will have two children, one from faithfulness, and the other from %0aunfaithfulness, by the confirmation of the Catholic Church, The other, %0awho to his confusion and late repentance, shall go about to ruin her, %0ashal] have three regions over a wid extent of ge that is to say, the %0aRoman, the German, and the Spanish, and it will take a military hand %0ato adequately take care of the arca stretching from the goth to the sand %0adegree of latitude, And all those remote regions north above the 48th %0adegree, who by vain fright shall quake, and then those of the west, south %0aand east shall tremble because of their power, and the power of that %0awhat shall be done cannot be undone by warlike power, They shall be %0aequal in nature, but much different in faith, %0a%0aAfter this the barren Dame, of a greater power than the second, shall %0a%0a%0acy %0a%0a%0aEPISULE TO WENRY IT ; 235 %0a%0a%0abe admitted by two people, by the first made obstinate by him that had %0ape over the others; by the second, and by the third, that shall extend %0ahis circuit to the cast of Europe; there his forces will stop and be over- %0acome, but by sca he will make his excursions into Trinacria and the %0aAdriatic with his myrmidons, Germany shall fall, and the Barbarian Sect %0ashall be wholly driven from among the Latins. ‘Then the great Empire of %0aAntichrist shall begin in the Attila, and Xerxes come down with an in- %0anumerable multitude of people, so that the coming of the Holy Ghost, %0aproceeding from the 48th degree, shall transmigrate, driving away the %0aabomination of the Antichrist, who made war against the royal person %0aof the great vicar of Jesus Christ and against His Church, and His Kingdom, %0aand reign per tempus, et in occasione temporis (for a time, and to the %0aend of time), And before this shall precede a solar eclipse, the most dark %0aand obscure that was since the creation of the world, till the death and %0apassion of Jesus Christ, and from Him until now. There shall be in the %0amonth of October,.a. great revolution made, such ‘that everybody ‘will %0athink that the carth has lost its natural motion and has gone down into %0aperpetual darkness, In the spring before and after this, shall happen %0aextraordinary changes, reversals of kingdoms, and great carthquakes; all %0athis nceompeni with the procreation of the New Babylon, a miserable %0aprostitute large with the abomination of the first holocaust.

I have been ever since perpetually %0a%3c dazzled, continually honouing and pions Bia that day, in which I pre- %0a%3c sented mysclf before it, as before a singular and humane Majesty. Now %0a%3c secking after some occasion whereby I might make appcar the goodness and %0a%3c sincerity of my heart and extend my acquaintance toward your most %0a%3c exccllont Majesty, and secing that it was impossible for me to declare it %0a%3c by effects, as well as because of the darkness and obscurity of my mind, %0a%3c even for the enlightening it did receive from the face of the greatest %0a%3c Monarch in the world, ft was a great while before I could resolve to %0a%3c whom I should dedicate these three lasf Conturies of my Prophecies, which %0a%3c make the complete thousand, After I had a long time considered, 1 %0a%3c have with a great temerity made my address to your Majesty, being no %0a%3c way daunted by it, as the great author Plutarch related in the Life of %0a%3c Lycurgus, that, sceing the offerings and gifts that were sacrificed in the %0a%3c temples of their heathen gods, many came no more, lest the people should %0a%3c wonder at the expense. %0a%3c %0a%3c Notwithstanding, sceing your royal splendor joined with an incomparable %0a%3c humanity, I have made my address to it, not as to the Kings of Persia, of %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c This cedicatory Ictter was used by Nostradamus as the preface to his second edition %0a%3c which contained new prophecies. %0a%3c %0a%3c The following notation appeared, on the page preceding the above epistle, in the %0a%3c 1672 edition of ‘I'he Prophecies or Prognostications of Michacl Nostradamus, translated %0a%3c and annotated by Theophilus de Garencicres, %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Friendly Reader, %0a%3c Before you rend the following epistle, I would have you be warmed of n few things: %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c One is, that according to-m u Li %0a%3c places, being without any hist connection, and besides thé” obscurily of the sense, %0a%3c the crabbedness of the expression is such, that had not the importunity of the Book- %0a%3c seller prevailed, 1 would have left it out, but gee agoiel the respect due to Antiquity, %0a%3c the satisfaction we owe to curious persons, who would perhaps lave thought the %0a%3c Book imperfect without it, we let it go, trusting to your candor and ingenuity, %0a%3c %0a%3c 231 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c opinion, it is very obscure and intelligible (sic) in most 3 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 232 VOMELETE PROTHEGIES OF NOSTRADAMUS %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c whom to come near it was forbidden, but as to a most prudent and wise %0a%3c prince.

But some may answer (who hath need lo blow his %0a%3c _ nose) that the rhyme is as casy to be understood, as the sense is hard to %0a%3c get at, ‘Iherefore, O most humane King, most of the prophetical stanzas %0a%3c are so difficult, that there is no way to be found for the interpretation %0a%3c of them, Nevertheless, being in hope of setting down the towns, cities, %0a%3c and regions, wherein most of those shall happen, especially in the year %0a%3c 158s, and in the year 1606, beginning from this present time, which is the %0a%3c sath of March, 1557. ; ; %0a%3c Going further to the fulfilling of those things, which shall be in the %0a%3c beginning of the seventh milleuary, according to my astronomical caleula- %0a%3c tion and other learning which I could reach fat which time the adversaries %0a%3c of Christ and of Tis Church shall begin to multiply), alt has been com. %0a%3c posed and calculated in days and hours of election, and well disposed, %0a%3c and all as accurately as was possible for me to do, And the whole “Minerva %0a%3c libera et non invita,” * calculating almost as much of the time that is %0a%3c come, as of that which is past, comprehending it in the present time, and %0a%3c what by the course of the said time shall be known to happen in al %0a%3c regions punctually as tt is here written, adding nothing superfluous, although %0a%3c it be said “Quod de futuris non ost cleterninala omnina veritas” ** Te is %0a%3c very true, Sit, that by my natural instinct given me hy my progenitors, J %0a%3c did think T could foretell anything; but having made an agreement %0a%3c between this said inslinct of ming, and a long calculation of “art, and %0a%3c by a great tranquility and repose of mind, by cemplying my soul of all %0a%3c care, T have foretold most part of these ex tripade neo (hy the brass %0a%3c tripod), though there he many who attribute to me some things that %0a%3c are no more mine than what Is nothing at all, Only the eternal God, %0a%3c who is the scarcher of men’s hearts, being pious, just, and merciful, is the %0a%3c true Judge of it; Tim I beseech to defend me from the calumny of %0a%3c wicked men, who would as willingly question how all your ancient pro- %0a%3c genitors, the Kings of Mrance, have healed the discase called the Kings %0a%3c cvil; how some other nations have cured the biting of venomous beasts; %0a%3c others have had a certain instinct to foretell things that are to come, %0a%3c and of others too tedious to be here inserted, Notwithstanding those in %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c * When Minerva was frea and favorable.” %0a%3c ** “There can bo no truth entirely determined for certain which concerns the future," %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c EPISYLE TO VENRY IN 233 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c whom the malignancy of the wicked spirit shall not be suppressed by %0a%3c length of time, I hope that after my decease my work shall be in more %0a%3c esteem than when I was alive, %0a%3c %0a%3c However, if I should fail in the. calculation of times, or should not %0a%3c please some, may it please your most imperial Majesty to forgive me, %0a%3c protesting before Go and Lis Saints, that I do not intend to insert %0a%3c anything in writing in this present Epistle that ay be contrary to the true %0a%3c Catholic faith, while consulting the astronomical calculations, according %0a%3c to my leatning. For the space of times of. our fathers that have becn before %0a%3c us are such, submitting mysclf to the correction of the most learned, that %0a%3c the first man Adam was before Noah, about one thousand two hundred %0a%3c and forty-two years, not computing the time according to the Gentile %0a%3c records, as Varro did, but only according to the Sacred Scriptures, taking %0a%3c them as a guide to my astronomical calculations, and to the best of my %0a%3c understanding. After Noah and the universal flood, about a thousand %0a%3c and fourscore years, came Abraham, who was a supreme astrologer, accord- %0a%3c ing to most men’s opinion, and did first invent the Chaldean letters; after %0a%3c that came Moses, some five hundred and fifteen or sixteen years after, %0a%3c And between the time of David and Moses there passed about five hun- %0a%3c dred and seventy years. After which, between the time of David and that %0a%3c of our Saviour and Redeemer Jesus Christ, born of the Virgin Mary, there %0a%3c hhegs (according to some chronographers) a thousand three hundred and ' %0a%3c %0a%3c ty years, %0a%3c %0a%3c sone may object, that this calculation is not true; because it differs %0a%3c from that of Eusebius, And from the time of human redemption, to that %0a%3c of the exccrable seduction of the Saracens, have passed six hundred and %0a%3c four and twenty years or thereabouts, From that time hitherto, it is %0a%3c easy to gather what times are past. If me roby Bure be not good amon %0a%3c all nations, however, all has becn calculated by the course of the solestiel %0a%3c bodies joined with emotion infused in me at certain loose hours, the %0a%3c emotion which has been handed down to me by my ancient progenitors, %0a%3c But the danger at this time (most execllent King) requires that such %0a%3c sceret events should not be manifested except by an cnigmatical sentence, %0a%3c haying but one sense and only one intelligence, without having mixed %0a%3c with it any ambiguous or amphibological calculation, But rather under %0a%3c a cloudy obscurity, through a natural infusion, coming near to the'sentence %0a%3c of one of the thousand and two Prophets, that have been since the Creation %0a%3c of the world, according to the calculation and Punic Chronicle of Joel: %0a%3c “Effundum spititum meum super omnem ¢carnem, et prophetabunt filit %0a%3c vestri, et filiae vestrae.” * But such a prophecy did proceed from the mouth %0a%3c of the Holy Spirit, who was the supreme and eternal power, which being %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c * Seo Joel ii.28, %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c A3dq COMPLETE PROPHECIES OF NOSTRADAMUS %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c come with that of the cclestial bodies, has caused some of them to predict %0a%3c great and wonderful things. %0a%3c %0a%3c Vor my part I challenge no such thing in this place, God forbid. I %0a%3c confess Luly, that all comes from God, lor which I give Him thanks, %0a%3c honor, and praise, without having mixed aiylhing of that divination which %0a%3c procecds 3 Fie but 4 Deo, d natura (which proceeds from fate, but from %0a%3c God, and nature).
