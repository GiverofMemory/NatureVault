and he was uncovered%0awithin his tent.%0a%0a9:22 And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father,%0aand told his two brethren without.%0a%0a9:23 And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their%0ashoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their%0afather; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's%0anakedness.%0a%0a9:24 And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had%0adone unto him.%0a%0a9:25 And he said, Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be%0aunto his brethren.%0a%0a9:26 And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Shem; and Canaan shall be%0ahis servant.%0a%0a9:27 God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of%0aShem;

separate thyself, I pray thee,%0afrom me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right;%0aor if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left.%0a%0a13:10 And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan,%0athat it was well watered every where, before the LORD destroyed Sodom%0aand Gomorrah, even as the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt,%0aas thou comest unto Zoar.%0a%0a13:11 Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed%0aeast: and they separated themselves the one from the other.%0a%0a13:12 Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in the%0acities of the plain, and pitched his tent toward Sodom.%0a%0a13:13 But the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the LORD%0aexceedingly.%0a%0a13:14 And the LORD said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated from%0ahim, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art%0anorthward, and southward, and eastward, and westward: 13:15 For all%0athe land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for%0aever.%0a%0a13:16 And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a%0aman can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be%0anumbered.%0a%0a13:17 Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the%0abreadth of it; for I will give it unto thee.%0a%0a13:18 Then Abram removed his tent, and came and dwelt in the plain of%0aMamre, which is in Hebron, and built there an altar unto the LORD.%0a%0a14:1 And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar,%0aArioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of%0anations; 14:2 That these made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with%0aBirsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of%0aZeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar.%0a%0a14:3 All these were joined together in the vale of Siddim, which is%0athe salt sea.%0a%0a14:4 Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year%0athey rebelled.%0a%0a14:5 And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that%0awere with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the%0aZuzims in Ham, and the Emins in Shaveh Kiriathaim, 14:6 And the%0aHorites in their mount Seir, unto Elparan, which is by the wilderness.%0a%0a14:7 And they returned, and came to Enmishpat, which is Kadesh, and%0asmote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that%0adwelt in Hazezontamar.%0a%0a14:8 And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah,%0aand the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela%0a(the same is Zoar;) and they joined battle with them in the vale of%0aSiddim; 14:9 With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king%0aof nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar;%0afour kings with five.%0a%0a14:10 And the vale of Siddim was full of slimepits; and the kings of%0aSodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remained fled%0ato the mountain.%0a%0a14:11 And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their%0avictuals, and went their way.%0a%0a14:12 And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom,%0aand his goods, and departed.%0a%0a14:13 And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew;%0afor he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and%0abrother of Aner: and these were confederate with Abram.%0a%0a14:14 And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he%0aarmed his trained servants, born in his own house, three hundred and%0aeighteen, and pursued them unto Dan.%0a%0a14:15 And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by%0anight, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the%0aleft hand of Damascus.%0a%0a14:16 And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his%0abrother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people.%0a%0a14:17 And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from%0athe slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that were with him, at%0athe valley of Shaveh, which is the king's dale.%0a%0a14:18 And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and%0ahe was the priest of the most high God.%0a%0a14:19 And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high%0aGod, possessor of heaven and earth: 14:20 And blessed be the most high%0aGod, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him%0atithes of all.%0a%0a14:21 And the king of Sodom said unto Abram, Give me the persons, and%0atake the goods to thyself.%0a%0a14:22 And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand%0aunto the LORD, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth,%0a14:23 That I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and%0athat I will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou shouldest say,%0aI have made Abram rich: 14:24 Save only that which the young men have%0aeaten, and the portion of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol,%0aand Mamre; let them take their portion.%0a%0a15:1 After these things the word of the LORD came unto Abram in a%0avision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding%0agreat reward.%0a%0a15:2 And Abram said, LORD God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go%0achildless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?%0a15:3 And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo,%0aone born in my house is mine heir.%0a%0a15:4 And, behold, the word of the LORD came unto him, saying, This%0ashall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own%0abowels shall be thine heir.%0a%0a15:5 And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward%0aheaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he%0asaid unto him, So shall thy seed be.%0a%0a15:6 And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for%0arighteousness.%0a%0a15:7 And he said unto him, I am the LORD that brought thee out of Ur%0aof the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it.%0a%0a15:8 And he said, LORD God, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit%0ait?  15:9 And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old,%0aand a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a%0aturtledove, and a young pigeon.%0a%0a15:10 And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst,%0aand laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not.%0a%0a15:11 And when the fowls came down upon the carcases, Abram drove them%0aaway.%0a%0a15:12 And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram;%0aand, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.%0a%0a15:13 And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be%0aa stranger in a land that is not their's, and shall serve them; and%0athey shall afflict them four hundred years; 15:14 And also that%0anation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they%0acome out with great substance.%0a%0a15:15 And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried%0ain a good old age.%0a%0a15:16 But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for%0athe iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.%0a%0a15:17 And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was%0adark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between%0athose pieces.%0a%0a15:18 In the same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying,%0aUnto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the%0agreat river, the river Euphrates: 15:19 The Kenites, and the%0aKenizzites, and the Kadmonites, 15:20 And the Hittites, and the%0aPerizzites, and the Rephaims, 15:21 And the Amorites, and the%0aCanaanites, and the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.%0a%0a16:1 Now Sarai Abram's wife bare him no children: and she had an%0ahandmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar.%0a%0a16:2 And Sarai said unto Abram, Behold now, the LORD hath restrained%0ame from bearing: I pray thee, go in unto my maid; it may be that I may%0aobtain children by her. And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai.%0a%0a16:3 And Sarai Abram's wife took Hagar her maid the Egyptian, after%0aAbram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to her%0ahusband Abram to be his wife.%0a%0a16:4 And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw%0athat she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.%0a%0a16:5 And Sarai said unto Abram, My wrong be upon thee: I have given my%0amaid into thy bosom; and when she saw that she had conceived, I was%0adespised in her eyes: the LORD judge between me and thee.%0a%0a16:6 But Abram said unto Sarai, Behold, thy maid is in thine hand; do%0ato her as it pleaseth thee. And when Sarai dealt hardly with her, she%0afled from her face.%0a%0a16:7 And the angel of the LORD found her by a fountain of water in the%0awilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur.%0a%0a16:8 And he said, Hagar, Sarai's maid, whence camest thou? and whither%0awilt thou go? And she said, I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai.%0a%0a16:9 And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Return to thy mistress,%0aand submit thyself under her hands.%0a%0a16:10 And the angel of the LORD said unto her, I will multiply thy%0aseed exceedingly, that it shall not be numbered for multitude.%0a%0a16:11 And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Behold, thou art with%0achild and shalt bear a son, and shalt call his name Ishmael; because%0athe LORD hath heard thy affliction.%0a%0a16:12 And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man,%0aand every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence%0aof all his brethren.%0a%0a16:13 And she called the name of the LORD that spake unto her, Thou%0aGod seest me: for she said, Have I also here looked after him that%0aseeth me?  16:14 Wherefore the well was called Beerlahairoi; behold,%0ait is between Kadesh and Bered.%0a%0a16:15 And Hagar bare Abram a son: and Abram called his son's name,%0awhich Hagar bare, Ishmael.%0a%0a16:16 And Abram was fourscore and six years old, when Hagar bare%0aIshmael to Abram.%0a%0a17:1 And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the LORD appeared%0ato Abram, and said unto him, I am the Almighty God; walk before me,%0aand be thou perfect.%0a%0a17:2 And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will%0amultiply thee exceedingly.%0a%0a17:3 And Abram fell on his face: and God talked with him, saying, 17:4%0aAs for me, behold, my covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be a%0afather of many nations.%0a%0a17:5 Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name%0ashall be Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made thee.%0a%0a17:6 And I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make nations%0aof thee, and kings shall come out of thee.%0a%0a17:7 And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed%0aafter thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a%0aGod unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.%0a%0a17:8 And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land%0awherein thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for an%0aeverlasting possession; and I will be their God.%0a%0a17:9 And God said unto Abraham, Thou shalt keep my covenant therefore,%0athou, and thy seed after thee in their generations.%0a%0a17:10 This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and%0athy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised.%0a%0a17:11 And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall%0abe a token of the covenant betwixt me and you.%0a%0a17:12 And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you,%0aevery man child in your generations, he that is born in the house, or%0abought with money of any stranger, which is not of thy seed.%0a%0a17:13 He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy%0amoney, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your%0aflesh for an everlasting covenant.%0a%0a17:14 And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is%0anot circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath%0abroken my covenant.%0a%0a17:15 And God said unto Abraham, As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not%0acall her name Sarai, but Sarah shall her name be.%0a%0a17:16 And I will bless her, and give thee a son also of her: yea, I%0awill bless her, and she shall be a mother of nations; kings of people%0ashall be of her.%0a%0a17:17 Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his%0aheart, Shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old?%0aand shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?  17:18 And Abraham%0asaid unto God, O that Ishmael might live before thee!  17:19 And God%0asaid, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt call%0ahis name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an%0aeverlasting covenant, and with his seed after him.%0a%0a17:20 And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed%0ahim, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly;%0atwelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation.%0a%0a17:21 But my covenant will I establish with Isaac, which Sarah shall%0abear unto thee at this set time in the next year.%0a%0a17:22 And he left off talking with him, and God went up from Abraham.%0a%0a17:23 And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his%0ahouse, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the%0amen of Abraham's house; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in%0athe selfsame day, as God had said unto him.%0a%0a17:24 And Abraham was ninety years old and nine, when he was%0acircumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.%0a%0a17:25 And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old, when he was%0acircumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.%0a%0a17:26 In the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his%0ason.%0a%0a17:27 And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with%0amoney of the stranger, were circumcised with him.%0a%0a18:1 And the LORD appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre: and he sat%0ain the tent door in the heat of the day; 18:2 And he lift up his eyes%0aand looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw them, he%0aran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the%0aground, 18:3 And said, My LORD, if now I have found favour in thy%0asight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant: 18:4 Let a little%0awater, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves%0aunder the tree: 18:5 And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort%0aye your hearts; after that ye shall pass on: for therefore are ye come%0ato your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said.%0a%0a18:6 And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make%0aready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes%0aupon the hearth.%0a%0a18:7 And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetcht a calf tender and good,%0aand gave it unto a young man; and he hasted to dress it.%0a%0a18:8 And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed,%0aand set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they%0adid eat.%0a%0a18:9 And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said,%0aBehold, in the tent.%0a%0a18:10 And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the%0atime of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah%0aheard it in the tent door, which was behind him.%0a%0a18:11 Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age; and it%0aceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.%0a%0a18:12 Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed%0aold shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?  18:13 And the LORD%0asaid unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a%0asurety bear a child, which am old?  18:14 Is any thing too hard for%0athe LORD? At the time appointed I will return unto thee, according to%0athe time of life, and Sarah shall have a son.%0a%0a18:15 Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid.%0aAnd he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.%0a%0a18:16 And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and%0aAbraham went with them to bring them on the way.%0a%0a18:17 And the LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I%0ado; 18:18 Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty%0anation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?%0a18:19 For I know him, that he will command his children and his%0ahousehold after him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD, to do%0ajustice and judgment; that the LORD may bring upon Abraham that which%0ahe hath spoken of him.%0a%0a18:20 And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is%0agreat, and because their sin is very grievous; 18:21 I will go down%0anow, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of%0ait, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.%0a%0a18:22 And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward%0aSodom: but Abraham stood yet before the LORD.%0a%0a18:23 And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the%0arighteous with the wicked?  18:24 Peradventure there be fifty%0arighteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the%0aplace for the fifty righteous that are therein?  18:25 That be far%0afrom thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the%0awicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far%0afrom thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?  18:26 And%0athe LORD said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city,%0athen I will spare all the place for their sakes.%0a%0a18:27 And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me%0ato speak unto the LORD, which am but dust and ashes: 18:28%0aPeradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou%0adestroy all the city for lack of five? And he said, If I find there%0aforty and five, I will not destroy it.%0a%0a18:29 And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there%0ashall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty's%0asake.%0a%0a18:30 And he said unto him, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will%0aspeak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he said, I%0awill not do it, if I find thirty there.%0a%0a18:31 And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the%0aLORD: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I%0awill not destroy it for twenty's sake.%0a%0a18:32 And he said, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will speak yet%0abut this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I%0awill not destroy it for ten's sake.%0a%0a18:33 And the LORD went his way, as soon as he had left communing with%0aAbraham: and Abraham returned unto his place.%0a%0a19:1 And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the%0agate of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and he bowed%0ahimself with his face toward the ground; 19:2 And he said, Behold now,%0amy lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant's house, and tarry%0aall night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on%0ayour ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all%0anight.%0a%0a19:3 And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him,%0aand entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake%0aunleavened bread, and they did eat.%0a%0a19:4 But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of%0aSodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people%0afrom every quarter: 19:5 And they called unto Lot, and said unto him,%0aWhere are the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out%0aunto us, that we may know them.%0a%0a19:6 And Lot went out at the door unto them, and shut the door after%0ahim, 19:7 And said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly.%0a%0a19:8 Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let%0ame, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good%0ain your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for therefore came they%0aunder the shadow of my roof.%0a%0a19:9 And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one fellow%0acame in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal%0aworse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man,%0aeven Lot, and came near to break the door.%0a%0a19:10 But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house%0ato them, and shut to the door.%0a%0a19:11 And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with%0ablindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to%0afind the door.%0a%0a19:12 And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in%0alaw, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the%0acity, bring them out of this place: 19:13 For we will destroy this%0aplace, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the%0aLORD; and the LORD hath sent us to destroy it.%0a%0a19:14 And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married%0ahis daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the LORD%0awill destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons%0ain law.%0a%0a19:15 And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot,%0asaying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here;%0alest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.%0a%0a19:16 And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon%0athe hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the LORD%0abeing merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him%0awithout the city.%0a%0a19:17 And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad,%0athat he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay%0athou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.%0a%0a19:18 And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my LORD: 19:19 Behold now,%0athy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy%0amercy, which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot%0aescape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die: 19:20%0aBehold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one:%0aOh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and my soul shall%0alive.%0a%0a19:21 And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this%0athing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thou%0ahast spoken.%0a%0a19:22 Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do anything till thou%0abe come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.%0a%0a19:23 The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar.%0a%0a19:24 Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and%0afire from the LORD out of heaven; 19:25 And he overthrew those cities,%0aand all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that%0awhich grew upon the ground.%0a%0a19:26 But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a%0apillar of salt.%0a%0a19:27 And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he%0astood before the LORD: 19:28 And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah,%0aand toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke%0aof the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.%0a%0a19:29 And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain,%0athat God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the%0aoverthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt.%0a%0a19:30 And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his%0atwo daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt%0ain a cave, he and his two daughters.%0a%0a19:31 And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old, and%0athere is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of%0aall the earth: 19:32 Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we%0awill lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.%0a%0a19:33 And they made their father drink wine that night: and the%0afirstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when%0ashe lay down, nor when she arose.%0a%0a19:34 And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto%0athe younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him%0adrink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we%0amay preserve seed of our father.%0a%0a19:35 And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the%0ayounger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay%0adown, nor when she arose.%0a%0a19:36 Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father.%0a%0a19:37 And the first born bare a son, and called his name Moab: the%0asame is the father of the Moabites unto this day.%0a%0a19:38 And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name%0aBenammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this%0aday.%0a%0a20:1 And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country, and%0adwelled between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar.%0a%0a20:2 And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister: and%0aAbimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah.%0a%0a20:3 But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him,%0aBehold, thou art but a dead man, for the woman which thou hast taken;%0afor she is a man's wife.%0a%0a20:4 But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, LORD, wilt thou%0aslay also a righteous nation?  20:5 Said he not unto me, She is my%0asister? and she, even she herself said, He is my brother: in the%0aintegrity of my heart and innocency of my hands have I done this.%0a%0a20:6 And God said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst%0athis in the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee from%0asinning against me: therefore suffered I thee not to touch her.%0a%0a20:7 Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet, and%0ahe shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore her%0anot, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that are%0athine.%0a%0a20:8 Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his%0aservants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were%0asore afraid.%0a%0a20:9 Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou%0adone unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on%0ame and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that%0aought not to be done.%0a%0a20:10 And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou%0ahast done this thing?  20:11 And Abraham said, Because I thought,%0aSurely the fear of God is not in this place; and they will slay me for%0amy wife's sake.%0a%0a20:12 And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my%0afather, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.%0a%0a20:13 And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my%0afather's house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou%0ashalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me,%0aHe is my brother.%0a%0a20:14 And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and%0awomenservants, and gave them unto Abraham, and restored him Sarah his%0awife.%0a%0a20:15 And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before thee: dwell where%0ait pleaseth thee.%0a%0a20:16 And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a%0athousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a covering of the%0aeyes, unto all that are with thee, and with all other: thus she was%0areproved.%0a%0a20:17 So Abraham prayed unto God: and God healed Abimelech, and his%0awife, and his maidservants; and they bare children.%0a%0a20:18 For the LORD had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of%0aAbimelech, because of Sarah Abraham's wife.%0a%0a21:1 And the LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did unto%0aSarah as he had spoken.%0a%0a21:2 For Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at%0athe set time of which God had spoken to him.%0a%0a21:3 And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him,%0awhom Sarah bare to him, Isaac.%0a%0a21:4 And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being eight days old, as%0aGod had commanded him.%0a%0a21:5 And Abraham was an hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born%0aunto him.%0a%0a21:6 And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh, so that all that hear%0awill laugh with me.%0a%0a21:7 And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah should%0ahave given children suck? for I have born him a son in his old age.%0a%0a21:8 And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great%0afeast the same day that Isaac was weaned.%0a%0a21:9 And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had born%0aunto Abraham, mocking.%0a%0a21:10 Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her%0ason: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, even%0awith Isaac.%0a%0a21:11 And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight because of%0ahis son.%0a%0a21:12 And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight%0abecause of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah%0ahath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy%0aseed be called.%0a%0a21:13 And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation,%0abecause he is thy seed.%0a%0a21:14 And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a%0abottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder,%0aand the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in%0athe wilderness of Beersheba.%0a%0a21:15 And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child%0aunder one of the shrubs.%0a%0a21:16 And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off,%0aas it were a bow shot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the%0achild.

All these were the children of Keturah.%0a%0a25:5 And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac.%0a%0a25:6 But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham%0agave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived,%0aeastward, unto the east country.%0a%0a25:7 And these are the days of the years of Abraham's life which he%0alived, an hundred threescore and fifteen years.%0a%0a25:8 Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an%0aold man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people.%0a%0a25:9 And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of%0aMachpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which%0ais before Mamre; 25:10 The field which Abraham purchased of the sons%0aof Heth: there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife.%0a%0a25:11 And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed%0ahis son Isaac; and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahairoi.%0a%0a25:12 Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom%0aHagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bare unto Abraham: 25:13 And%0athese are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according%0ato their generations: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebajoth; and Kedar,%0aand Adbeel, and Mibsam, 25:14 And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa, 25:15%0aHadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah: 25:16 These are the sons%0aof Ishmael, and these are their names, by their towns, and by their%0acastles; twelve princes according to their nations.%0a%0a25:17 And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and%0athirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was%0agathered unto his people.%0a%0a25:18 And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that is before Egypt, as%0athou goest toward Assyria: and he died in the presence of all his%0abrethren.%0a%0a25:19 And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son: Abraham%0abegat Isaac: 25:20 And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah%0ato wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padanaram, the sister%0ato Laban the Syrian.%0a%0a25:21 And Isaac intreated the LORD for his wife, because she was%0abarren: and the LORD was intreated of him, and Rebekah his wife%0aconceived.%0a%0a25:22 And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If%0ait be so, why am I thus? And she went to enquire of the LORD.%0a%0a25:23 And the LORD said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, and two%0amanner of people shall be separated from thy bowels; and the one%0apeople shall be stronger than the other people; and the elder shall%0aserve the younger.%0a%0a25:24 And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there%0awere twins in her womb.%0a%0a25:25 And the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment; and%0athey called his name Esau.%0a%0a25:26 And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on%0aEsau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was threescore%0ayears old when she bare them.%0a%0a25:27 And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the%0afield; and Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in tents.%0a%0a25:28 And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison: but%0aRebekah loved Jacob.%0a%0a25:29 And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he was%0afaint: 25:30 And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that%0asame red pottage; for I am faint: therefore was his name called Edom.%0a%0a25:31 And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright.%0a%0a25:32 And Esau said, Behold, I am at the point to die: and what profit%0ashall this birthright do to me?  25:33 And Jacob said, Swear to me%0athis day; and he sware unto him: and he sold his birthright unto%0aJacob.%0a%0a25:34 Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did%0aeat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised his%0abirthright.%0a%0a26:1 And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine that%0awas in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the%0aPhilistines unto Gerar.%0a%0a26:2 And the LORD appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into Egypt;%0adwell in the land which I shall tell thee of: 26:3 Sojourn in this%0aland, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee; for unto thee, and%0aunto thy seed, I will give all these countries, and I will perform the%0aoath which I sware unto Abraham thy father; 26:4 And I will make thy%0aseed to multiply as the stars of heaven, and will give unto thy seed%0aall these countries; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the%0aearth be blessed; 26:5 Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept%0amy charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.%0a%0a26:6 And Isaac dwelt in Gerar: 26:7 And the men of the place asked him%0aof his wife; and he said, She is my sister: for he feared to say, She%0ais my wife; lest, said he, the men of the place should kill me for%0aRebekah; because she was fair to look upon.%0a%0a26:8 And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that%0aAbimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw,%0aand, behold, Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife.%0a%0a26:9 And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, of a surety she is%0athy wife; and how saidst thou, She is my sister? And Isaac said unto%0ahim, Because I said, Lest I die for her.%0a%0a26:10 And Abimelech said, What is this thou hast done unto us? one of%0athe people might lightly have lien with thy wife, and thou shouldest%0ahave brought guiltiness upon us.%0a%0a26:11 And Abimelech charged all his people, saying, He that toucheth%0athis man or his wife shall surely be put to death.%0a%0a26:12 Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year an%0ahundredfold: and the LORD blessed him.%0a%0a26:13 And the man waxed great, and went forward, and grew until he%0abecame very great: 26:14 For he had possession of flocks, and%0apossession of herds, and great store of servants: and the Philistines%0aenvied him.%0a%0a26:15 For all the wells which his father's servants had digged in the%0adays of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped them, and%0afilled them with earth.%0a%0a26:16 And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us; for thou art much%0amightier than we.%0a%0a26:17 And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the valley of%0aGerar, and dwelt there.%0a%0a26:18 And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had digged%0ain the days of Abraham his father; for the Philistines had stopped%0athem after the death of Abraham: and he called their names after the%0anames by which his father had called them.%0a%0a26:19 And Isaac's servants digged in the valley, and found there a%0awell of springing water.%0a%0a26:20 And the herdmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac's herdmen,%0asaying, The water is ours: and he called the name of the well Esek;%0abecause they strove with him.%0a%0a26:21 And they digged another well, and strove for that also: and he%0acalled the name of it Sitnah.%0a%0a26:22 And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for%0athat they strove not: and he called the name of it Rehoboth; and he%0asaid, For now the LORD hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitful%0ain the land.%0a%0a26:23 And he went up from thence to Beersheba.%0a%0a26:24 And the LORD appeared unto him the same night, and said, I am%0athe God of Abraham thy father: fear not, for I am with thee, and will%0abless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham's sake.%0a%0a26:25 And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name of the%0aLORD, and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac's servants digged a%0awell.%0a%0a26:26 Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his%0afriends, and Phichol the chief captain of his army.%0a%0a26:27 And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore come ye to me, seeing ye%0ahate me, and have sent me away from you?  26:28 And they said, We saw%0acertainly that the LORD was with thee: and we said, Let there be now%0aan oath betwixt us, even betwixt us and thee, and let us make a%0acovenant with thee; 26:29 That thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not%0atouched thee, and as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have%0asent thee away in peace: thou art now the blessed of the LORD.%0a%0a26:30 And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink.%0a%0a26:31 And they rose up betimes in the morning, and sware one to%0aanother: and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in%0apeace.%0a%0a26:32 And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac's servants came,%0aand told him concerning the well which they had digged, and said unto%0ahim, We have found water.%0a%0a26:33 And he called it Shebah: therefore the name of the city is%0aBeersheba unto this day.%0a%0a26:34 And Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith the%0adaughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of Elon the%0aHittite: 26:35 Which were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah.%0a%0a27:1 And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were%0adim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his eldest son, and said%0aunto him, My son: and he said unto him, Behold, here am I.%0a%0a27:2 And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my%0adeath: 27:3 Now therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver%0aand thy bow, and go out to the field, and take me some venison; 27:4%0aAnd make me savoury meat, such as I love, and bring it to me, that I%0amay eat; that my soul may bless thee before I die.%0a%0a27:5 And Rebekah heard when Isaac spake to Esau his son. And Esau went%0ato the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it.%0a%0a27:6 And Rebekah spake unto Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard thy%0afather speak unto Esau thy brother, saying, 27:7 Bring me venison, and%0amake me savoury meat, that I may eat, and bless thee before the LORD%0abefore my death.%0a%0a27:8 Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I%0acommand thee.%0a%0a27:9 Go now to the flock, and fetch me from thence two good kids of%0athe goats; and I will make them savoury meat for thy father, such as%0ahe loveth: 27:10 And thou shalt bring it to thy father, that he may%0aeat, and that he may bless thee before his death.%0a%0a27:11 And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother is%0aa hairy man, and I am a smooth man: 27:12 My father peradventure will%0afeel me, and I shall seem to him as a deceiver; and I shall bring a%0acurse upon me, and not a blessing.%0a%0a27:13 And his mother said unto him, Upon me be thy curse, my son: only%0aobey my voice, and go fetch me them.%0a%0a27:14 And he went, and fetched, and brought them to his mother: and%0ahis mother made savoury meat, such as his father loved.%0a%0a27:15 And Rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son Esau, which%0awere with her in the house, and put them upon Jacob her younger son:%0a27:16 And she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands,%0aand upon the smooth of his neck: 27:17 And she gave the savoury meat%0aand the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.%0a%0a27:18 And he came unto his father, and said, My father: and he said,%0aHere am I; who art thou, my son?  27:19 And Jacob said unto his%0afather, I am Esau thy first born; I have done according as thou badest%0ame: arise, I pray thee, sit and eat of my venison, that thy soul may%0abless me.%0a%0a27:20 And Isaac said unto his son, How is it that thou hast found it%0aso quickly, my son? And he said, Because the LORD thy God brought it%0ato me.%0a%0a27:21 And Isaac said unto Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I may%0afeel thee, my son, whether thou be my very son Esau or not.%0a%0a27:22 And Jacob went near unto Isaac his father; and he felt him, and%0asaid, The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.%0a%0a27:23 And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his%0abrother Esau's hands: so he blessed him.%0a%0a27:24 And he said, Art thou my very son Esau? And he said, I am.%0a%0a27:25 And he said, Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son's%0avenison, that my soul may bless thee. And he brought it near to him,%0aand he did eat: and he brought him wine and he drank.%0a%0a27:26 And his father Isaac said unto him, Come near now, and kiss me,%0amy son.%0a%0a27:27 And he came near, and kissed him: and he smelled the smell of%0ahis raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my son is as%0athe smell of a field which the LORD hath blessed: 27:28 Therefore God%0agive thee of the dew of heaven, and the fatness of the earth, and%0aplenty of corn and wine: 27:29 Let people serve thee, and nations bow%0adown to thee: be lord over thy brethren, and let thy mother's sons bow%0adown to thee: cursed be every one that curseth thee, and blessed be he%0athat blesseth thee.%0a%0a27:30 And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of%0ablessing Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of%0aIsaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting.%0a%0a27:31 And he also had made savoury meat, and brought it unto his%0afather, and said unto his father, Let my father arise, and eat of his%0ason's venison, that thy soul may bless me.%0a%0a27:32 And Isaac his father said unto him, Who art thou? And he said, I%0aam thy son, thy firstborn Esau.%0a%0a27:33 And Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who? where is he%0athat hath taken venison, and brought it me, and I have eaten of all%0abefore thou camest, and have blessed him? yea, and he shall be%0ablessed.%0a%0a27:34 And when Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with a%0agreat and exceeding bitter cry, and said unto his father, Bless me,%0aeven me also, O my father.%0a%0a27:35 And he said, Thy brother came with subtilty, and hath taken away%0athy blessing.%0a%0a27:36 And he said, Is not he rightly named Jacob? for he hath%0asupplanted me these two times: he took away my birthright; and,%0abehold, now he hath taken away my blessing. And he said, Hast thou not%0areserved a blessing for me?  27:37 And Isaac answered and said unto%0aEsau, Behold, I have made him thy lord, and all his brethren have I%0agiven to him for servants; and with corn and wine have I sustained%0ahim: and what shall I do now unto thee, my son?  27:38 And Esau said%0aunto his father, Hast thou but one blessing, my father? bless me, even%0ame also, O my father. And Esau lifted up his voice, and wept.%0a%0a27:39 And Isaac his father answered and said unto him, Behold, thy%0adwelling shall be the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of heaven%0afrom above; 27:40 And by thy sword shalt thou live, and shalt serve%0athy brother; and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the%0adominion, that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck.%0a%0a27:41 And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith his%0afather blessed him: and Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning%0afor my father are at hand; then will I slay my brother Jacob.%0a%0a27:42 And these words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah: and%0ashe sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said unto him, Behold,%0athy brother Esau, as touching thee, doth comfort himself, purposing to%0akill thee.%0a%0a27:43 Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; arise, flee thou to Laban%0amy brother to Haran; 27:44 And tarry with him a few days, until thy%0abrother's fury turn away; 27:45 Until thy brother's anger turn away%0afrom thee, and he forget that which thou hast done to him: then I will%0asend, and fetch thee from thence: why should I be deprived also of you%0aboth in one day?  27:46 And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my%0alife because of the daughters of Heth: if Jacob take a wife of the%0adaughters of Heth, such as these which are of the daughters of the%0aland, what good shall my life do me?  28:1 And Isaac called Jacob, and%0ablessed him, and charged him, and said unto him, Thou shalt not take a%0awife of the daughters of Canaan.%0a%0a28:2 Arise, go to Padanaram, to the house of Bethuel thy mother's%0afather; and take thee a wife from thence of the daughers of Laban thy%0amother's brother.%0a%0a28:3 And God Almighty bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and multiply%0athee, that thou mayest be a multitude of people; 28:4 And give thee%0athe blessing of Abraham, to thee, and to thy seed with thee; that thou%0amayest inherit the land wherein thou art a stranger, which God gave%0aunto Abraham.%0a%0a28:5 And Isaac sent away Jacob: and he went to Padanaram unto Laban,%0ason of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob's and Esau's%0amother.%0a%0a28:6 When Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob, and sent him away to%0aPadanaram, to take him a wife from thence; and that as he blessed him%0ahe gave him a charge, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife of the%0adaughers of Canaan; 28:7 And that Jacob obeyed his father and his%0amother, and was gone to Padanaram; 28:8 And Esau seeing that the%0adaughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac his father; 28:9 Then went Esau%0aunto Ishmael, and took unto the wives which he had Mahalath the%0adaughter of Ishmael Abraham's son, the sister of Nebajoth, to be his%0awife.%0a%0a28:10 And Jacob went out from Beersheba, and went toward Haran.%0a%0a28:11 And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all%0anight, because the sun was set; and he took of the stones of that%0aplace, and put them for his pillows, and lay down in that place to%0asleep.%0a%0a28:12 And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the%0atop of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God ascending%0aand descending on it.%0a%0a28:13 And, behold, the LORD stood above it, and said, I am the LORD%0aGod of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac: the land whereon thou%0aliest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed; 28:14 And thy seed%0ashall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt spread abroad to the%0awest, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south: and in thee%0aand in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.%0a%0a28:15 And, behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places%0awhither thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land; for I%0awill not leave thee, until I have done that which I have spoken to%0athee of.%0a%0a28:16 And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the LORD%0ais in this place; and I knew it not.%0a%0a28:17 And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place! this is%0anone other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.%0a%0a28:18 And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that%0ahe had put for his pillows, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil%0aupon the top of it.%0a%0a28:19 And he called the name of that place Bethel: but the name of%0athat city was called Luz at the first.%0a%0a28:20 And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will%0akeep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and%0araiment to put on, 28:21 So that I come again to my father's house in%0apeace; then shall the LORD be my God: 28:22 And this stone, which I%0ahave set for a pillar, shall be God's house: and of all that thou%0ashalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee.%0a%0a29:1 Then Jacob went on his journey, and came into the land of the%0apeople of the east.%0a%0a29:2 And he looked, and behold a well in the field, and, lo, there%0awere three flocks of sheep lying by it; for out of that well they%0awatered the flocks: and a great stone was upon the well's mouth.%0a%0a29:3 And thither were all the flocks gathered: and they rolled the%0astone from the well's mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone%0aagain upon the well's mouth in his place.%0a%0a29:4 And Jacob said unto them, My brethren, whence be ye? And they%0asaid, Of Haran are we.%0a%0a29:5 And he said unto them, Know ye Laban the son of Nahor? And they%0asaid, We know him.%0a%0a29:6 And he said unto them, Is he well? And they said, He is well:%0aand, behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep.%0a%0a29:7 And he said, Lo, it is yet high day, neither is it time that the%0acattle should be gathered together: water ye the sheep, and go and%0afeed them.%0a%0a29:8 And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered%0atogether, and till they roll the stone from the well's mouth; then we%0awater the sheep.%0a%0a29:9 And while he yet spake with them, Rachel came with her father's%0asheep; for she kept them.%0a%0a29:10 And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban%0ahis mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother's brother,%0athat Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and%0awatered the flock of Laban his mother's brother.%0a%0a29:11 And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept.%0a%0a29:12 And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's brother, and that%0ahe was Rebekah's son: and she ran and told her father.%0a%0a29:13 And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his%0asister's son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed%0ahim, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban all these things.%0a%0a29:14 And Laban said to him, Surely thou art my bone and my flesh. And%0ahe abode with him the space of a month.%0a%0a29:15 And Laban said unto Jacob, Because thou art my brother,%0ashouldest thou therefore serve me for nought? tell me, what shall thy%0awages be?  29:16 And Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder%0awas Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.%0a%0a29:17 Leah was tender eyed; but Rachel was beautiful and well%0afavoured.%0a%0a29:18 And Jacob loved Rachel; and said, I will serve thee seven years%0afor Rachel thy younger daughter.%0a%0a29:19 And Laban said, It is better that I give her to thee, than that%0aI should give her to another man: abide with me.%0a%0a29:20 And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed unto%0ahim but a few days, for the love he had to her.%0a%0a29:21 And Jacob said unto Laban, Give me my wife, for my days are%0afulfilled, that I may go in unto her.%0a%0a29:22 And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a%0afeast.%0a%0a29:23 And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his%0adaughter, and brought her to him; and he went in unto her.%0a%0a29:24 And Laban gave unto his daughter Leah Zilpah his maid for an%0ahandmaid.%0a%0a29:25 And it came to pass, that in the morning, behold, it was Leah:%0aand he said to Laban, What is this thou hast done unto me? did not I%0aserve with thee for Rachel? wherefore then hast thou beguiled me?%0a29:26 And Laban said, It must not be so done in our country, to give%0athe younger before the firstborn.%0a%0a29:27 Fulfil her week, and we will give thee this also for the service%0awhich thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years.%0a%0a29:28 And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week: and he gave him Rachel%0ahis daughter to wife also.%0a%0a29:29 And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be%0aher maid.%0a%0a29:30 And he went in also unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more%0athan Leah, and served with him yet seven other years.%0a%0a29:31 And when the LORD saw that Leah was hated, he opened her womb:%0abut Rachel was barren.%0a%0a29:32 And Leah conceived, and bare a son, and she called his name%0aReuben: for she said, Surely the LORD hath looked upon my affliction;%0anow therefore my husband will love me.%0a%0a29:33 And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Because the%0aLORD hath heard I was hated, he hath therefore given me this son also:%0aand she called his name Simeon.%0a%0a29:34 And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Now this time%0awill my husband be joined unto me, because I have born him three sons:%0atherefore was his name called Levi.%0a%0a29:35 And she conceived again, and bare a son: and she said, Now will%0aI praise the LORD: therefore she called his name Judah; and left%0abearing.%0a%0a30:1 And when Rachel saw that she bare Jacob no children, Rachel%0aenvied her sister; and said unto Jacob, Give me children, or else I%0adie.%0a%0a30:2 And Jacob's anger was kindled against Rachel: and he said, Am I%0ain God's stead, who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb?%0a30:3 And she said, Behold my maid Bilhah, go in unto her; and she%0ashall bear upon my knees, that I may also have children by her.%0a%0a30:4 And she gave him Bilhah her handmaid to wife: and Jacob went in%0aunto her.%0a%0a30:5 And Bilhah conceived, and bare Jacob a son.%0a%0a30:6 And Rachel said, God hath judged me, and hath also heard my%0avoice, and hath given me a son: therefore called she his name Dan.%0a%0a30:7 And Bilhah Rachel's maid conceived again, and bare Jacob a second%0ason.%0a%0a30:8 And Rachel said, With great wrestlings have I wrestled with my%0asister, and I have prevailed: and she called his name Naphtali.%0a%0a30:9 When Leah saw that she had left bearing, she took Zilpah her%0amaid, and gave her Jacob to wife.%0a%0a30:10 And Zilpah Leah's maid bare Jacob a son.%0a%0a30:11 And Leah said, A troop cometh: and she called his name Gad.%0a%0a30:12 And Zilpah Leah's maid bare Jacob a second son.%0a%0a30:13 And Leah said, Happy am I, for the daughters will call me%0ablessed: and she called his name Asher.%0a%0a30:14 And Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found%0amandrakes in the field, and brought them unto his mother Leah. Then%0aRachel said to Leah, Give me, I pray thee, of thy son's mandrakes.%0a%0a30:15 And she said unto her, Is it a small matter that thou hast taken%0amy husband? and wouldest thou take away my son's mandrakes also? And%0aRachel said, Therefore he shall lie with thee to night for thy son's%0amandrakes.%0a%0a30:16 And Jacob came out of the field in the evening, and Leah went%0aout to meet him, and said, Thou must come in unto me; for surely I%0ahave hired thee with my son's mandrakes. And he lay with her that%0anight.%0a%0a30:17 And God hearkened unto Leah, and she conceived, and bare Jacob%0athe fifth son.%0a%0a30:18 And Leah said, God hath given me my hire, because I have given%0amy maiden to my husband: and she called his name Issachar.%0a%0a30:19 And Leah conceived again, and bare Jacob the sixth son.%0a%0a30:20 And Leah said, God hath endued me with a good dowry; now will my%0ahusband dwell with me, because I have born him six sons: and she%0acalled his name Zebulun.%0a%0a30:21 And afterwards she bare a daughter, and called her name Dinah.%0a%0a30:22 And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, and opened%0aher womb.%0a%0a30:23 And she conceived, and bare a son; and said, God hath taken away%0amy reproach: 30:24 And she called his name Joseph; and said, The LORD%0ashall add to me another son.%0a%0a30:25 And it came to pass, when Rachel had born Joseph, that Jacob%0asaid unto Laban, Send me away, that I may go unto mine own place, and%0ato my country.%0a%0a30:26 Give me my wives and my children, for whom I have served thee,%0aand let me go: for thou knowest my service which I have done thee.%0a%0a30:27 And Laban said unto him, I pray thee, if I have found favour in%0athine eyes, tarry: for I have learned by experience that the LORD hath%0ablessed me for thy sake.%0a%0a30:28 And he said, Appoint me thy wages, and I will give it.%0a%0a30:29 And he said unto him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and%0ahow thy cattle was with me.%0a%0a30:30 For it was little which thou hadst before I came, and it is now%0aincreased unto a multitude; and the LORD hath blessed thee since my%0acoming: and now when shall I provide for mine own house also?  30:31%0aAnd he said, What shall I give thee? And Jacob said, Thou shalt not%0agive me any thing: if thou wilt do this thing for me, I will again%0afeed and keep thy flock.%0a%0a30:32 I will pass through all thy flock to day, removing from thence%0aall the speckled and spotted cattle, and all the brown cattle among%0athe sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats: and of such%0ashall be my hire.%0a%0a30:33 So shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come, when it%0ashall come for my hire before thy face: every one that is not speckled%0aand spotted among the goats, and brown among the sheep, that shall be%0acounted stolen with me.%0a%0a30:34 And Laban said, Behold, I would it might be according to thy%0aword.%0a%0a30:35 And he removed that day the he goats that were ringstraked and%0aspotted, and all the she goats that were speckled and spotted, and%0aevery one that had some white in it, and all the brown among the%0asheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons.%0a%0a30:36 And he set three days' journey betwixt himself and Jacob: and%0aJacob fed the rest of Laban's flocks.%0a%0a30:37 And Jacob took him rods of green poplar, and of the hazel and%0achesnut tree; and pilled white strakes in them, and made the white%0aappear which was in the rods.%0a%0a30:38 And he set the rods which he had pilled before the flocks in the%0agutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to drink, that%0athey should conceive when they came to drink.%0a%0a30:39 And the flocks conceived before the rods, and brought forth%0acattle ringstraked, speckled, and spotted.%0a%0a30:40 And Jacob did separate the lambs, and set the faces of the%0aflocks toward the ringstraked, and all the brown in the flock of%0aLaban; and he put his own flocks by themselves, and put them not unto%0aLaban's cattle.%0a%0a30:41 And it came to pass, whensoever the stronger cattle did%0aconceive, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle in%0athe gutters, that they might conceive among the rods.%0a%0a30:42 But when the cattle were feeble, he put them not in: so the%0afeebler were Laban's, and the stronger Jacob's.%0a%0a30:43 And the man increased exceedingly, and had much cattle, and%0amaidservants, and menservants, and camels, and asses.%0a%0a31:1 And he heard the words of Laban's sons, saying, Jacob hath taken%0aaway all that was our father's; and of that which was our father's%0ahath he gotten all this glory.%0a%0a31:2 And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it was%0anot toward him as before.%0a%0a31:3 And the LORD said unto Jacob, Return unto the land of thy%0afathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee.%0a%0a31:4 And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto his%0aflock, 31:5 And said unto them, I see your father's countenance, that%0ait is not toward me as before; but the God of my father hath been with%0ame.%0a%0a31:6 And ye know that with all my power I have served your father.%0a%0a31:7 And your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten times;%0abut God suffered him not to hurt me.%0a%0a31:8 If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages; then all the%0acattle bare speckled: and if he said thus, The ringstraked shall be%0athy hire; then bare all the cattle ringstraked.%0a%0a31:9 Thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father, and given%0athem to me.%0a%0a31:10 And it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived, that%0aI lifted up mine eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold, the rams which%0aleaped upon the cattle were ringstraked, speckled, and grisled.%0a%0a31:11 And the angel of God spake unto me in a dream, saying, Jacob:%0aAnd I said, Here am I.%0a%0a31:12 And he said, Lift up now thine eyes, and see, all the rams which%0aleap upon the cattle are ringstraked, speckled, and grisled: for I%0ahave seen all that Laban doeth unto thee.%0a%0a31:13 I am the God of Bethel, where thou anointedst the pillar, and%0awhere thou vowedst a vow unto me: now arise, get thee out from this%0aland, and return unto the land of thy kindred.%0a%0a31:14 And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him, Is there yet any%0aportion or inheritance for us in our father's house?  31:15 Are we not%0acounted of him strangers? for he hath sold us, and hath quite devoured%0aalso our money.%0a%0a31:16 For all the riches which God hath taken from our father, that is%0aours, and our children's: now then, whatsoever God hath said unto%0athee, do.%0a%0a31:17 Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon camels;%0a31:18 And he carried away all his cattle, and all his goods which he%0ahad gotten, the cattle of his getting, which he had gotten in%0aPadanaram, for to go to Isaac his father in the land of Canaan.%0a%0a31:19 And Laban went to shear his sheep: and Rachel had stolen the%0aimages that were her father's.%0a%0a31:20 And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he%0atold him not that he fled.%0a%0a31:21 So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed over%0athe river, and set his face toward the mount Gilead.%0a%0a31:22 And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled.%0a%0a31:23 And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven%0adays' journey; and they overtook him in the mount Gilead.%0a%0a31:24 And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night, and said%0aunto him, Take heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.%0a%0a31:25 Then Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the%0amount: and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mount of Gilead.%0a%0a31:26 And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast%0astolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters, as captives%0ataken with the sword?  31:27 Wherefore didst thou flee away secretly,%0aand steal away from me; and didst not tell me, that I might have sent%0athee away with mirth, and with songs, with tabret, and with harp?%0a31:28 And hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters? thou%0ahast now done foolishly in so doing.%0a%0a31:29 It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of%0ayour father spake unto me yesternight, saying, Take thou heed that%0athou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.%0a%0a31:30 And now, though thou wouldest needs be gone, because thou sore%0alongedst after thy father's house, yet wherefore hast thou stolen my%0agods?  31:31 And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was%0aafraid: for I said, Peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy%0adaughters from me.%0a%0a31:32 With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, let him not live: before%0aour brethren discern thou what is thine with me, and take it to thee.%0aFor Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them.%0a%0a31:33 And Laban went into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and into%0athe two maidservants' tents; but he found them not. Then went he out%0aof Leah's tent, and entered into Rachel's tent.%0a%0a31:34 Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camel's%0afurniture, and sat upon them. And Laban searched all the tent, but%0afound them not.%0a%0a31:35 And she said to her father, Let it not displease my lord that I%0acannot rise up before thee; for the custom of women is upon me. And he%0asearched but found not the images.%0a%0a31:36 And Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban: and Jacob answered%0aand said to Laban, What is my trespass? what is my sin, that thou hast%0aso hotly pursued after me?  31:37 Whereas thou hast searched all my%0astuff, what hast thou found of all thy household stuff? set it here%0abefore my brethren and thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt us%0aboth.%0a%0a31:38 This twenty years have I been with thee; thy ewes and thy she%0agoats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flock have I not%0aeaten.%0a%0a31:39 That which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee; I bare%0athe loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it, whether stolen by%0aday, or stolen by night.%0a%0a31:40 Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by%0anight; and my sleep departed from mine eyes.%0a%0a31:41 Thus have I been twenty years in thy house; I served thee%0afourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy cattle:%0aand thou hast changed my wages ten times.%0a%0a31:42 Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of%0aIsaac, had been with me, surely thou hadst sent me away now empty. God%0ahath seen mine affliction and the labour of my hands, and rebuked thee%0ayesternight.%0a%0a31:43 And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, These daughters are my%0adaughters, and these children are my children, and these cattle are my%0acattle, and all that thou seest is mine: and what can I do this day%0aunto these my daughters, or unto their children which they have born?%0a31:44 Now therefore come thou, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and%0alet it be for a witness between me and thee.%0a%0a31:45 And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar.%0a%0a31:46 And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took%0astones, and made an heap: and they did eat there upon the heap.%0a%0a31:47 And Laban called it Jegarsahadutha: but Jacob called it Galeed.%0a%0a31:48 And Laban said, This heap is a witness between me and thee this%0aday.%0a%0aTherefore was the name of it called Galeed; 31:49 And Mizpah; for he%0asaid, The LORD watch between me and thee, when we are absent one from%0aanother.%0a%0a31:50 If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take other%0awives beside my daughters, no man is with us; see, God is witness%0abetwixt me and thee.%0a%0a31:51 And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold this%0apillar, which I have cast betwixt me and thee: 31:52 This heap be%0awitness, and this pillar be witness, that I will not pass over this%0aheap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this%0apillar unto me, for harm.%0a%0a31:53 The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their%0afather, judge betwixt us. And Jacob sware by the fear of his father%0aIsaac.%0a%0a31:54 Then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount, and called his%0abrethren to eat bread: and they did eat bread, and tarried all night%0ain the mount.%0a%0a31:55 And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and%0ahis daughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed, and returned unto%0ahis place.%0a%0a32:1 And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.%0a%0a32:2 And when Jacob saw them, he said, This is God's host: and he%0acalled the name of that place Mahanaim.%0a%0a32:3 And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the%0aland of Seir, the country of Edom.%0a%0a32:4 And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak unto my lord%0aEsau; Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with Laban, and%0astayed there until now: 32:5 And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and%0amenservants, and womenservants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that%0aI may find grace in thy sight.%0a%0a32:6 And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy%0abrother Esau, and also he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men%0awith him.%0a%0a32:7 Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed: and he divided the%0apeople that was with him, and the flocks, and herds, and the camels,%0ainto two bands; 32:8 And said, If Esau come to the one company, and%0asmite it, then the other company which is left shall escape.%0a%0a32:9 And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father%0aIsaac, the LORD which saidst unto me, Return unto thy country, and to%0athy kindred, and I will deal well with thee: 32:10 I am not worthy of%0athe least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which thou hast%0ashewed unto thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan;%0aand now I am become two bands.%0a%0a32:11 Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the%0ahand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me, and the%0amother with the children.%0a%0a32:12 And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed%0aas the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.%0a%0a32:13 And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which came%0ato his hand a present for Esau his brother; 32:14 Two hundred she%0agoats, and twenty he goats, two hundred ewes, and twenty rams, 32:15%0aThirty milch camels with their colts, forty kine, and ten bulls,%0atwenty she asses, and ten foals.%0a%0a32:16 And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove%0aby themselves; and said unto his servants, Pass over before me, and%0aput a space betwixt drove and drove.%0a%0a32:17 And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother%0ameeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose art thou? and whither%0agoest thou? and whose are these before thee?  32:18 Then thou shalt%0asay, They be thy servant Jacob's; it is a present sent unto my lord%0aEsau: and, behold, also he is behind us.%0a%0a32:19 And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that%0afollowed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau,%0awhen ye find him.%0a%0a32:20 And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us. For%0ahe said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and%0aafterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept of me.%0a%0a32:21 So went the present over before him: and himself lodged that%0anight in the company.%0a%0a32:22 And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two%0awomenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford Jabbok.%0a%0a32:23 And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over%0athat he had.%0a%0a32:24 And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him%0auntil the breaking of the day.%0a%0a32:25 And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched%0athe hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of%0ajoint, as he wrestled with him.%0a%0a32:26 And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I%0awill not let thee go, except thou bless me.%0a%0a32:27 And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob.%0a%0a32:28 And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel:%0afor as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast%0aprevailed.%0a%0a32:29 And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name.%0aAnd he said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name? And he%0ablessed him there.%0a%0a32:30 And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen%0aGod face to face, and my life is preserved.%0a%0a32:31 And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he%0ahalted upon his thigh.%0a%0a32:32 Therefore the children of Israel eat not of the sinew which%0ashrank, which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: because%0ahe touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew that shrank.%0a%0a33:1 And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau came,%0aand with him four hundred men. And he divided the children unto Leah,%0aand unto Rachel, and unto the two handmaids.%0a%0a33:2 And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah%0aand her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost.%0a%0a33:3 And he passed over before them, and bowed himself to the ground%0aseven times, until he came near to his brother.%0a%0a33:4 And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck,%0aand kissed him: and they wept.%0a%0a33:5 And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children;%0aand said, Who are those with thee? And he said, The children which God%0ahath graciously given thy servant.%0a%0a33:6 Then the handmaidens came near, they and their children, and they%0abowed themselves.%0a%0a33:7 And Leah also with her children came near, and bowed themselves:%0aand after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they bowed themselves.%0a%0a33:8 And he said, What meanest thou by all this drove which I met? And%0ahe said, These are to find grace in the sight of my lord.%0a%0a33:9 And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; keep that thou hast%0aunto thyself.%0a%0a33:10 And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found grace in%0athy sight, then receive my present at my hand: for therefore I have%0aseen thy face, as though I had seen the face of God, and thou wast%0apleased with me.%0a%0a33:11 Take, I pray thee, my blessing that is brought to thee; because%0aGod hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough. And he%0aurged him, and he took it.%0a%0a33:12 And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will%0ago before thee.%0a%0a33:13 And he said unto him, My lord knoweth that the children are%0atender, and the flocks and herds with young are with me: and if men%0ashould overdrive them one day, all the flock will die.%0a%0a33:14 Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant: and I%0awill lead on softly, according as the cattle that goeth before me and%0athe children be able to endure, until I come unto my lord unto Seir.%0a%0a33:15 And Esau said, Let me now leave with thee some of the folk that%0aare with me. And he said, What needeth it? let me find grace in the%0asight of my lord.%0a%0a33:16 So Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir.%0a%0a33:17 And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him an house, and made%0abooths for his cattle: therefore the name of the place is called%0aSuccoth.%0a%0a33:18 And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which is in the%0aland of Canaan, when he came from Padanaram; and pitched his tent%0abefore the city.%0a%0a33:19 And he bought a parcel of a field, where he had spread his tent,%0aat the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem's father, for an hundred%0apieces of money.%0a%0a33:20 And he erected there an altar, and called it EleloheIsrael.%0a%0a34:1 And Dinah the daughter of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob, went%0aout to see the daughters of the land.%0a%0a34:2 And when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, prince of the%0acountry, saw her, he took her, and lay with her, and defiled her.%0a%0a34:3 And his soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved%0athe damsel, and spake kindly unto the damsel.%0a%0a34:4 And Shechem spake unto his father Hamor, saying, Get me this%0adamsel to wife.%0a%0a34:5 And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter: now his%0asons were with his cattle in the field: and Jacob held his peace until%0athey were come.%0a%0a34:6 And Hamor the father of Shechem went out unto Jacob to commune%0awith him.%0a%0a34:7 And the sons of Jacob came out of the field when they heard it:%0aand the men were grieved, and they were very wroth, because he had%0awrought folly in Israel in lying with Jacob's daughter: which thing%0aought not to be done.%0a%0a34:8 And Hamor communed with them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem%0alongeth for your daughter: I pray you give her him to wife.%0a%0a34:9 And make ye marriages with us, and give your daughters unto us,%0aand take our daughters unto you.%0a%0a34:10 And ye shall dwell with us: and the land shall be before you;%0adwell and trade ye therein, and get you possessions therein.%0a%0a34:11 And Shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren, Let me%0afind grace in your eyes, and what ye shall say unto me I will give.%0a%0a34:12 Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I will give according%0aas ye shall say unto me: but give me the damsel to wife.%0a%0a34:13 And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father%0adeceitfully, and said, because he had defiled Dinah their sister:%0a34:14 And they said unto them, We cannot do this thing, to give our%0asister to one that is uncircumcised; for that were a reproach unto us:%0a34:15 But in this will we consent unto you: If ye will be as we be,%0athat every male of you be circumcised; 34:16 Then will we give our%0adaughters unto you, and we will take your daughters to us, and we will%0adwell with you, and we will become one people.%0a%0a34:17 But if ye will not hearken unto us, to be circumcised; then will%0awe take our daughter, and we will be gone.%0a%0a34:18 And their words pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor's son.%0a%0a34:19 And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had%0adelight in Jacob's daughter: and he was more honourable than all the%0ahouse of his father.%0a%0a34:20 And Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate of their city,%0aand communed with the men of their city, saying, 34:21 These men are%0apeaceable with us; therefore let them dwell in the land, and trade%0atherein; for the land, behold, it is large enough for them; let us%0atake their daughters to us for wives, and let us give them our%0adaughters.%0a%0a34:22 Only herein will the men consent unto us for to dwell with us,%0ato be one people, if every male among us be circumcised, as they are%0acircumcised.%0a%0a34:23 Shall not their cattle and their substance and every beast of%0atheir's be our's? only let us consent unto them, and they will dwell%0awith us.%0a%0a34:24 And unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened all that went%0aout of the gate of his city; and every male was circumcised, all that%0awent out of the gate of his city.%0a%0a34:25 And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore, that%0atwo of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brethren, took each%0aman his sword, and came upon the city boldly, and slew all the males.%0a%0a34:26 And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the%0asword, and took Dinah out of Shechem's house, and went out.%0a%0a34:27 The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and spoiled the city,%0abecause they had defiled their sister.%0a%0a34:28 They took their sheep, and their oxen, and their asses, and that%0awhich was in the city, and that which was in the field, 34:29 And all%0atheir wealth, and all their little ones, and their wives took they%0acaptive, and spoiled even all that was in the house.%0a%0a34:30 And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me to make%0ame to stink among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites%0aand the Perizzites: and I being few in number, they shall gather%0athemselves together against me, and slay me; and I shall be destroyed,%0aI and my house.%0a%0a34:31 And they said, Should he deal with our sister as with an harlot?%0a35:1 And God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwell there:%0aand make there an altar unto God, that appeared unto thee when thou%0afleddest from the face of Esau thy brother.%0a%0a35:2 Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were with%0ahim, Put away the strange gods that are among you, and be clean, and%0achange your garments: 35:3 And let us arise, and go up to Bethel; and%0aI will make there an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my%0adistress, and was with me in the way which I went.%0a%0a35:4 And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which were in their%0ahand, and all their earrings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid%0athem under the oak which was by Shechem.%0a%0a35:5 And they journeyed: and the terror of God was upon the cities%0athat were round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of%0aJacob.%0a%0a35:6 So Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan, that is,%0aBethel, he and all the people that were with him.%0a%0a35:7 And he built there an altar, and called the place Elbethel:%0abecause there God appeared unto him, when he fled from the face of his%0abrother.%0a%0a35:8 But Deborah Rebekah's nurse died, and she was buried beneath%0aBethel under an oak: and the name of it was called Allonbachuth.%0a%0a35:9 And God appeared unto Jacob again, when he came out of Padanaram,%0aand blessed him.%0a%0a35:10 And God said unto him, Thy name is Jacob: thy name shall not be%0acalled any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name: and he called his%0aname Israel.%0a%0a35:11 And God said unto him, I am God Almighty: be fruitful and%0amultiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee, and%0akings shall come out of thy loins; 35:12 And the land which I gave%0aAbraham and Isaac, to thee I will give it, and to thy seed after thee%0awill I give the land.%0a%0a35:13 And God went up from him in the place where he talked with him.%0a%0a35:14 And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him,%0aeven a pillar of stone: and he poured a drink offering thereon, and he%0apoured oil thereon.%0a%0a35:15 And Jacob called the name of the place where God spake with him,%0aBethel.%0a%0a35:16 And they journeyed from Bethel; and there was but a little way%0ato come to Ephrath: and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labour.%0a%0a35:17 And it came to pass, when she was in hard labour, that the%0amidwife said unto her, Fear not; thou shalt have this son also.%0a%0a35:18 And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing, (for she%0adied) that she called his name Benoni: but his father called him%0aBenjamin.%0a%0a35:19 And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath, which is%0aBethlehem.%0a%0a35:20 And Jacob set a pillar upon her grave: that is the pillar of%0aRachel's grave unto this day.%0a%0a35:21 And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of%0aEdar.%0a%0a35:22 And it came to pass, when Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben%0awent and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine: and Israel heard it.%0aNow the sons of Jacob were twelve: 35:23 The sons of Leah; Reuben,%0aJacob's firstborn, and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and%0aZebulun: 35:24 The sons of Rachel; Joseph, and Benjamin: 35:25 And the%0asons of Bilhah, Rachel's handmaid; Dan, and Naphtali: 35:26 And the%0asons of Zilpah, Leah's handmaid: Gad, and Asher: these are the sons of%0aJacob, which were born to him in Padanaram.%0a%0a35:27 And Jacob came unto Isaac his father unto Mamre, unto the city%0aof Arbah, which is Hebron, where Abraham and Isaac sojourned.%0a%0a35:28 And the days of Isaac were an hundred and fourscore years.%0a%0a35:29 And Isaac gave up the ghost, and died, and was gathered unto his%0apeople, being old and full of days: and his sons Esau and Jacob buried%0ahim.%0a%0a36:1 Now these are the generations of Esau, who is Edom.%0a%0a36:2 Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan; Adah the daughter%0aof Elon the Hittite, and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah the daughter%0aof Zibeon the Hivite; 36:3 And Bashemath Ishmael's daughter, sister of%0aNebajoth.%0a%0a36:4 And Adah bare to Esau Eliphaz; and Bashemath bare Reuel; 36:5 And%0aAholibamah bare Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah: these are the sons of%0aEsau, which were born unto him in the land of Canaan.%0a%0a36:6 And Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and all%0athe persons of his house, and his cattle, and all his beasts, and all%0ahis substance, which he had got in the land of Canaan; and went into%0athe country from the face of his brother Jacob.%0a%0a36:7 For their riches were more than that they might dwell together;%0aand the land wherein they were strangers could not bear them because%0aof their cattle.%0a%0a36:8 Thus dwelt Esau in mount Seir: Esau is Edom.%0a%0a36:9 And these are the generations of Esau the father of the Edomites%0ain mount Seir: 36:10 These are the names of Esau's sons;

Joseph, being seventeen years%0aold, was feeding the flock with his brethren; and the lad was with the%0asons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his father's wives: and%0aJoseph brought unto his father their evil report.%0a%0a37:3 Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he%0awas the son of his old age: and he made him a coat of many colours.%0a%0a37:4 And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than%0aall his brethren, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto%0ahim.%0a%0a37:5 And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it his brethren: and they%0ahated him yet the more.%0a%0a37:6 And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have%0adreamed: 37:7 For, behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and,%0alo, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your sheaves%0astood round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf.%0a%0a37:8 And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? or%0ashalt thou indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him yet the%0amore for his dreams, and for his words.%0a%0a37:9 And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his brethren, and%0asaid, Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and, behold, the sun and%0athe moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me.%0a%0a37:10 And he told it to his father, and to his brethren: and his%0afather rebuked him, and said unto him, What is this dream that thou%0ahast dreamed?  Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to%0abow down ourselves to thee to the earth?  37:11 And his brethren%0aenvied him; but his father observed the saying.%0a%0a37:12 And his brethren went to feed their father's flock in Shechem.%0a%0a37:13 And Israel said unto Joseph, Do not thy brethren feed the flock%0ain Shechem? come, and I will send thee unto them. And he said to him,%0aHere am I.%0a%0a37:14 And he said to him, Go, I pray thee, see whether it be well with%0athy brethren, and well with the flocks; and bring me word again. So he%0asent him out of the vale of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.%0a%0a37:15 And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering in%0athe field: and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou?  37:16%0aAnd he said, I seek my brethren: tell me, I pray thee, where they feed%0atheir flocks.%0a%0a37:17 And the man said, They are departed hence; for I heard them say,%0aLet us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brethren, and found%0athem in Dothan.%0a%0a37:18 And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near unto%0athem, they conspired against him to slay him.%0a%0a37:19 And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh.%0a%0a37:20 Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into some%0apit, and we will say, Some evil beast hath devoured him: and we shall%0asee what will become of his dreams.%0a%0a37:21 And Reuben heard it, and he delivered him out of their hands;%0aand said, Let us not kill him.%0a%0a37:22 And Reuben said unto them, Shed no blood, but cast him into this%0apit that is in the wilderness, and lay no hand upon him; that he might%0arid him out of their hands, to deliver him to his father again.%0a%0a37:23 And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren,%0athat they stript Joseph out of his coat, his coat of many colours that%0awas on him; 37:24 And they took him, and cast him into a pit: and the%0apit was empty, there was no water in it.%0a%0a37:25 And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes%0aand looked, and, behold, a company of Ishmeelites came from Gilead%0awith their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh, going to carry%0ait down to Egypt.%0a%0a37:26 And Judah said unto his brethren, What profit is it if we slay%0aour brother, and conceal his blood?  37:27 Come, and let us sell him%0ato the Ishmeelites, and let not our hand be upon him; for he is our%0abrother and our flesh. And his brethren were content.%0a%0a37:28 Then there passed by Midianites merchantmen; and they drew and%0alifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmeelites%0afor twenty pieces of silver: and they brought Joseph into Egypt.%0a%0a37:29 And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph was not in%0athe pit; and he rent his clothes.%0a%0a37:30 And he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child is not;%0aand I, whither shall I go?  37:31 And they took Joseph's coat, and%0akilled a kid of the goats, and dipped the coat in the blood; 37:32 And%0athey sent the coat of many colours, and they brought it to their%0afather; and said, This have we found: know now whether it be thy son's%0acoat or no.%0a%0a37:33 And he knew it, and said, It is my son's coat; an evil beast%0ahath devoured him; Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces.%0a%0a37:34 And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins,%0aand mourned for his son many days.%0a%0a37:35 And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him;%0abut he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down into%0athe grave unto my son mourning. Thus his father wept for him.%0a%0a37:36 And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer%0aof Pharaoh's, and captain of the guard.%0a%0a38:1 And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his%0abrethren, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah.%0a%0a38:2 And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose name%0awas Shuah; and he took her, and went in unto her.%0a%0a38:3 And she conceived, and bare a son; and he called his name Er.%0a%0a38:4 And she conceived again, and bare a son; and she called his name%0aOnan.%0a%0a38:5 And she yet again conceived, and bare a son; and called his name%0aShelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bare him.%0a%0a38:6 And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, whose name was Tamar.%0a%0a38:7 And Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the LORD;%0aand the LORD slew him.%0a%0a38:8 And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother's wife, and%0amarry her, and raise up seed to thy brother.%0a%0a38:9 And Onan knew that the seed should not be his; and it came to%0apass, when he went in unto his brother's wife, that he spilled it on%0athe ground, lest that he should give seed to his brother.%0a%0a38:10 And the thing which he did displeased the LORD: wherefore he%0aslew him also.%0a%0a38:11 Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter in law, Remain a widow at%0athy father's house, till Shelah my son be grown: for he said, Lest%0aperadventure he die also, as his brethren did. And Tamar went and%0adwelt in her father's house.%0a%0a38:12 And in process of time the daughter of Shuah Judah's wife died;%0aand Judah was comforted, and went up unto his sheepshearers to%0aTimnath, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.%0a%0a38:13 And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold thy father in law goeth up%0ato Timnath to shear his sheep.%0a%0a38:14 And she put her widow's garments off from her, and covered her%0awith a vail, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place, which is%0aby the way to Timnath; for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was%0anot given unto him to wife.%0a%0a38:15 When Judah saw her, he thought her to be an harlot; because she%0ahad covered her face.%0a%0a38:16 And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray thee,%0alet me come in unto thee; (for he knew not that she was his daughter%0ain law.) And she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come%0ain unto me?  38:17 And he said, I will send thee a kid from the flock.%0aAnd she said, Wilt thou give me a pledge, till thou send it?  38:18%0aAnd he said, What pledge shall I give thee? And she said, Thy signet,%0aand thy bracelets, and thy staff that is in thine hand. And he gave it%0aher, and came in unto her, and she conceived by him.%0a%0a38:19 And she arose, and went away, and laid by her vail from her, and%0aput on the garments of her widowhood.%0a%0a38:20 And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite,%0ato receive his pledge from the woman's hand: but he found her not.%0a%0a38:21 Then he asked the men of that place, saying, Where is the%0aharlot, that was openly by the way side? And they said, There was no%0aharlot in this place.%0a%0a38:22 And he returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her; and also%0athe men of the place said, that there was no harlot in this place.%0a%0a38:23 And Judah said, Let her take it to her, lest we be shamed:%0abehold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her.%0a%0a38:24 And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told%0aJudah, saying, Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot; and%0aalso, behold, she is with child by whoredom. And Judah said, Bring her%0aforth, and let her be burnt.%0a%0a38:25 When she was brought forth, she sent to her father in law,%0asaying, By the man, whose these are, am I with child: and she said,%0aDiscern, I pray thee, whose are these, the signet, and bracelets, and%0astaff.%0a%0a38:26 And Judah acknowledged them, and said, She hath been more%0arighteous than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my son. And he%0aknew her again no more.%0a%0a38:27 And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold,%0atwins were in her womb.%0a%0a38:28 And it came to pass, when she travailed, that the one put out%0ahis hand: and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet%0athread, saying, This came out first.%0a%0a38:29 And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his%0abrother came out: and she said, How hast thou broken forth? this%0abreach be upon thee: therefore his name was called Pharez.%0a%0a38:30 And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet thread%0aupon his hand: and his name was called Zarah.%0a%0a39:1 And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer of%0aPharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hands of%0athe Ishmeelites, which had brought him down thither.%0a%0a39:2 And the LORD was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he%0awas in the house of his master the Egyptian.%0a%0a39:3 And his master saw that the LORD was with him, and that the LORD%0amade all that he did to prosper in his hand.%0a%0a39:4 And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him: and he%0amade him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his%0ahand.%0a%0a39:5 And it came to pass from the time that he had made him overseer%0ain his house, and over all that he had, that the LORD blessed the%0aEgyptian's house for Joseph's sake; and the blessing of the LORD was%0aupon all that he had in the house, and in the field.%0a%0a39:6 And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand; and he knew not%0aought he had, save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was a goodly%0aperson, and well favoured.%0a%0a39:7 And it came to pass after these things, that his master's wife%0acast her eyes upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me.%0a%0a39:8 But he refused, and said unto his master's wife, Behold, my%0amaster wotteth not what is with me in the house, and he hath committed%0aall that he hath to my hand; 39:9 There is none greater in this house%0athan I; neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee, because%0athou art his wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin%0aagainst God?  39:10 And it came to pass, as she spake to Joseph day by%0aday, that he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, or to be with her.%0a%0a39:11 And it came to pass about this time, that Joseph went into the%0ahouse to do his business; and there was none of the men of the house%0athere within.%0a%0a39:12 And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he%0aleft his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out.%0a%0a39:13 And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment%0ain her hand, and was fled forth, 39:14 That she called unto the men of%0aher house, and spake unto them, saying, See, he hath brought in an%0aHebrew unto us to mock us; he came in unto me to lie with me, and I%0acried with a loud voice: 39:15 And it came to pass, when he heard that%0aI lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and%0afled, and got him out.%0a%0a39:16 And she laid up his garment by her, until his lord came home.%0a%0a39:17 And she spake unto him according to these words, saying, The%0aHebrew servant, which thou hast brought unto us, came in unto me to%0amock me: 39:18 And it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried,%0athat he left his garment with me, and fled out.%0a%0a39:19 And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his%0awife, which she spake unto him, saying, After this manner did thy%0aservant to me; that his wrath was kindled.%0a%0a39:20 And Joseph's master took him, and put him into the prison, a%0aplace where the king's prisoners were bound: and he was there in the%0aprison.%0a%0a39:21 But the LORD was with Joseph, and shewed him mercy, and gave him%0afavour in the sight of the keeper of the prison.%0a%0a39:22 And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand all the%0aprisoners that were in the prison; and whatsoever they did there, he%0awas the doer of it.%0a%0a39:23 The keeper of the prison looked not to any thing that was under%0ahis hand; because the LORD was with him, and that which he did, the%0aLORD made it to prosper.%0a%0a40:1 And it came to pass after these things, that the butler of the%0aking of Egypt and his baker had offended their lord the king of Egypt.%0a%0a40:2 And Pharaoh was wroth against two of his officers, against the%0achief of the butlers, and against the chief of the bakers.%0a%0a40:3 And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard,%0ainto the prison, the place where Joseph was bound.%0a%0a40:4 And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he%0aserved them: and they continued a season in ward.%0a%0a40:5 And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream in one%0anight, each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the%0abutler and the baker of the king of Egypt, which were bound in the%0aprison.%0a%0a40:6 And Joseph came in unto them in the morning, and looked upon%0athem, and, behold, they were sad.%0a%0a40:7 And he asked Pharaoh's officers that were with him in the ward of%0ahis lord's house, saying, Wherefore look ye so sadly to day?  40:8 And%0athey said unto him, We have dreamed a dream, and there is no%0ainterpreter of it. And Joseph said unto them, Do not interpretations%0abelong to God? tell me them, I pray you.%0a%0a40:9 And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him,%0aIn my dream, behold, a vine was before me; 40:10 And in the vine were%0athree branches: and it was as though it budded, and her blossoms shot%0aforth; and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes: 40:11 And%0aPharaoh's cup was in my hand: and I took the grapes, and pressed them%0ainto Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand.%0a%0a40:12 And Joseph said unto him, This is the interpretation of it: The%0athree branches are three days: 40:13 Yet within three days shall%0aPharaoh lift up thine head, and restore thee unto thy place: and thou%0ashalt deliver Pharaoh's cup into his hand, after the former manner%0awhen thou wast his butler.%0a%0a40:14 But think on me when it shall be well with thee, and shew%0akindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh,%0aand bring me out of this house: 40:15 For indeed I was stolen away out%0aof the land of the Hebrews: and here also have I done nothing that%0athey should put me into the dungeon.%0a%0a40:16 When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he%0asaid unto Joseph, I also was in my dream, and, behold, I had three%0awhite baskets on my head: 40:17 And in the uppermost basket there was%0aof all manner of bakemeats for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out%0aof the basket upon my head.%0a%0a40:18 And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation%0athereof: The three baskets are three days: 40:19 Yet within three days%0ashall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and shall hang thee on a%0atree; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee.%0a%0a40:20 And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday,%0athat he made a feast unto all his servants: and he lifted up the head%0aof the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants.%0a%0a40:21 And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again; and%0ahe gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand: 40:22 But he hanged the chief%0abaker: as Joseph had interpreted to them.%0a%0a40:23 Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat him.%0a%0a41:1 And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh%0adreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river.%0a%0a41:2 And, behold, there came up out of the river seven well favoured%0akine and fatfleshed; and they fed in a meadow.%0a%0a41:3 And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the%0ariver, ill favoured and leanfleshed; and stood by the other kine upon%0athe brink of the river.%0a%0a41:4 And the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven%0awell favoured and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke.%0a%0a41:5 And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven ears%0aof corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good.%0a%0a41:6 And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind%0asprung up after them.%0a%0a41:7 And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears.%0aAnd Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was a dream.%0a%0a41:8 And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled;%0aand he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the%0awise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but there was none%0athat could interpret them unto Pharaoh.%0a%0a41:9 Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember%0amy faults this day: 41:10 Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put%0ame in ward in the captain of the guard's house, both me and the chief%0abaker: 41:11 And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed%0aeach man according to the interpretation of his dream.%0a%0a41:12 And there was there with us a young man, an Hebrew, servant to%0athe captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us%0aour dreams; to each man according to his dream he did interpret.%0a%0a41:13 And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he%0arestored unto mine office, and him he hanged.%0a%0a41:14 Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him%0ahastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved himself, and changed his%0araiment, and came in unto Pharaoh.%0a%0a41:15 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and there%0ais none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of thee, that thou%0acanst understand a dream to interpret it.%0a%0a41:16 And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: God shall%0agive Pharaoh an answer of peace.%0a%0a41:17 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon%0athe bank of the river: 41:18 And, behold, there came up out of the%0ariver seven kine, fatfleshed and well favoured; and they fed in a%0ameadow: 41:19 And, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor%0aand very ill favoured and leanfleshed, such as I never saw in all the%0aland of Egypt for badness: 41:20 And the lean and the ill favoured%0akine did eat up the first seven fat kine: 41:21 And when they had%0aeaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but%0athey were still ill favoured, as at the beginning. So I awoke.%0a%0a41:22 And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in one%0astalk, full and good: 41:23 And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin,%0aand blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them: 41:24 And the%0athin ears devoured the seven good ears: and I told this unto the%0amagicians; but there was none that could declare it to me.%0a%0a41:25 And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one: God%0ahath shewed Pharaoh what he is about to do.%0a%0a41:26 The seven good kine are seven years; and the seven good ears are%0aseven years: the dream is one.%0a%0a41:27 And the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after them%0aare seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind%0ashall be seven years of famine.%0a%0a41:28 This is the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: What God is%0aabout to do he sheweth unto Pharaoh.%0a%0a41:29 Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all%0athe land of Egypt: 41:30 And there shall arise after them seven years%0aof famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt;%0aand the famine shall consume the land; 41:31 And the plenty shall not%0abe known in the land by reason of that famine following; for it shall%0abe very grievous.%0a%0a41:32 And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; it is%0abecause the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it%0ato pass.%0a%0a41:33 Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and%0aset him over the land of Egypt.%0a%0a41:34 Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint officers over the land,%0aand take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous%0ayears.%0a%0a41:35 And let them gather all the food of those good years that come,%0aand lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them keep food in%0athe cities.%0a%0a41:36 And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven%0ayears of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land%0aperish not through the famine.%0a%0a41:37 And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes%0aof all his servants.%0a%0a41:38 And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find such a one as%0athis is, a man in whom the Spirit of God is?  41:39 And Pharaoh said%0aunto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shewed thee all this, there is none%0aso discreet and wise as thou art: 41:40 Thou shalt be over my house,%0aand according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled: only in the%0athrone will I be greater than thou.%0a%0a41:41 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the%0aland of Egypt.%0a%0a41:42 And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon%0aJoseph's hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a%0agold chain about his neck; 41:43 And he made him to ride in the second%0achariot which he had; and they cried before him, Bow the knee: and he%0amade him ruler over all the land of Egypt.%0a%0a41:44 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without thee%0ashall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.%0a%0a41:45 And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphnathpaaneah; and he gave%0ahim to wife Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On. And%0aJoseph went out over all the land of Egypt.%0a%0a41:46 And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh%0aking of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and%0awent throughout all the land of Egypt.%0a%0a41:47 And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by%0ahandfuls.%0a%0a41:48 And he gathered up all the food of the seven years, which were%0ain the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of%0athe field, which was round about every city, laid he up in the same.%0a%0a41:49 And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much,%0auntil he left numbering; for it was without number.%0a%0a41:50 And unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine%0acame, which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On bare unto%0ahim.%0a%0a41:51 And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For God,%0asaid he, hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father's house.%0a%0a41:52 And the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God hath%0acaused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.%0a%0a41:53 And the seven years of plenteousness, that was in the land of%0aEgypt, were ended.%0a%0a41:54 And the seven years of dearth began to come, according as Joseph%0ahad said: and the dearth was in all lands; but in all the land of%0aEgypt there was bread.%0a%0a41:55 And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to%0aPharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, Go unto%0aJoseph; what he saith to you, do.%0a%0a41:56 And the famine was over all the face of the earth: and Joseph%0aopened all the storehouses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and the%0afamine waxed sore in the land of Egypt.%0a%0a41:57 And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy corn;%0abecause that the famine was so sore in all lands.%0a%0a42:1 Now when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob said unto%0ahis sons, Why do ye look one upon another?  42:2 And he said, Behold,%0aI have heard that there is corn in Egypt: get you down thither, and%0abuy for us from thence; that we may live, and not die.%0a%0a42:3 And Joseph's ten brethren went down to buy corn in Egypt.%0a%0a42:4 But Benjamin, Joseph's brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren;%0afor he said, Lest peradventure mischief befall him.%0a%0a42:5 And the sons of Israel came to buy corn among those that came:%0afor the famine was in the land of Canaan.%0a%0a42:6 And Joseph was the governor over the land, and he it was that%0asold to all the people of the land: and Joseph's brethren came, and%0abowed down themselves before him with their faces to the earth.%0a%0a42:7 And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself%0astrange unto them, and spake roughly unto them; and he said unto them,%0aWhence come ye? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food.%0a%0a42:8 And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him.%0a%0a42:9 And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and%0asaid unto them, Ye are spies; to see the nakedness of the land ye are%0acome.%0a%0a42:10 And they said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy%0aservants come.%0a%0a42:11 We are all one man's sons; we are true men, thy servants are no%0aspies.%0a%0a42:12 And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the land%0aye are come.%0a%0a42:13 And they said, Thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of one%0aman in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest is this day with%0aour father, and one is not.%0a%0a42:14 And Joseph said unto them, That is it that I spake unto you,%0asaying, Ye are spies: 42:15 Hereby ye shall be proved: By the life of%0aPharaoh ye shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother come%0ahither.%0a%0a42:16 Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall be%0akept in prison, that your words may be proved, whether there be any%0atruth in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye are spies.%0a%0a42:17 And he put them all together into ward three days.%0a%0a42:18 And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live; for%0aI fear God: 42:19 If ye be true men, let one of your brethren be bound%0ain the house of your prison: go ye, carry corn for the famine of your%0ahouses: 42:20 But bring your youngest brother unto me; so shall your%0awords be verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so.%0a%0a42:21 And they said one to another, We are verily guilty concerning%0aour brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he besought%0aus, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us.%0a%0a42:22 And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you, saying,%0aDo not sin against the child; and ye would not hear? therefore,%0abehold, also his blood is required.%0a%0a42:23 And they knew not that Joseph understood them; for he spake unto%0athem by an interpreter.%0a%0a42:24 And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and returned to%0athem again, and communed with them, and took from them Simeon, and%0abound him before their eyes.%0a%0a42:25 Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn, and to%0arestore every man's money into his sack, and to give them provision%0afor the way: and thus did he unto them.%0a%0a42:26 And they laded their asses with the corn, and departed thence.%0a%0a42:27 And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in%0athe inn, he espied his money; for, behold, it was in his sack's mouth.%0a%0a42:28 And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo, it%0ais even in my sack: and their heart failed them, and they were afraid,%0asaying one to another, What is this that God hath done unto us?  42:29%0aAnd they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan, and%0atold him all that befell unto them; saying, 42:30 The man, who is the%0alord of the land, spake roughly to us, and took us for spies of the%0acountry.%0a%0a42:31 And we said unto him, We are true men; we are no spies: 42:32 We%0abe twelve brethren, sons of our father; one is not, and the youngest%0ais this day with our father in the land of Canaan.%0a%0a42:33 And the man, the lord of the country, said unto us, Hereby shall%0aI know that ye are true men; leave one of your brethren here with me,%0aand take food for the famine of your households, and be gone: 42:34%0aAnd bring your youngest brother unto me: then shall I know that ye are%0ano spies, but that ye are true men: so will I deliver you your%0abrother, and ye shall traffick in the land.%0a%0a42:35 And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold,%0aevery man's bundle of money was in his sack: and when both they and%0atheir father saw the bundles of money, they were afraid.%0a%0a42:36 And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved of my%0achildren: Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will take Benjamin%0aaway: all these things are against me.%0a%0a42:37 And Reuben spake unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I%0abring him not to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him%0ato thee again.%0a%0a42:38 And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother%0ais dead, and he is left alone: if mischief befall him by the way in%0athe which ye go, then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to%0athe grave.%0a%0a43:1 And the famine was sore in the land.%0a%0a43:2 And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the corn which they%0ahad brought out of Egypt, their father said unto them, Go again, buy%0aus a little food.%0a%0a43:3 And Judah spake unto him, saying, The man did solemnly protest%0aunto us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with%0ayou.%0a%0a43:4 If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy%0athee food: 43:5 But if thou wilt not send him, we will not go down:%0afor the man said unto us, Ye shall not see my face, except your%0abrother be with you.%0a%0a43:6 And Israel said, Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me, as to tell%0athe man whether ye had yet a brother?  43:7 And they said, The man%0aasked us straitly of our state, and of our kindred, saying, Is your%0afather yet alive? have ye another brother? and we told him according%0ato the tenor of these words: could we certainly know that he would%0asay, Bring your brother down?  43:8 And Judah said unto Israel his%0afather, Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go; that we may%0alive, and not die, both we, and thou, and also our little ones.%0a%0a43:9 I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him: if I%0abring him not unto thee, and set him before thee, then let me bear the%0ablame for ever: 43:10 For except we had lingered, surely now we had%0areturned this second time.%0a%0a43:11 And their father Israel said unto them, If it must be so now, do%0athis; take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels, and carry%0adown the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spices, and%0amyrrh, nuts, and almonds: 43:12 And take double money in your hand;%0aand the money that was brought again in the mouth of your sacks, carry%0ait again in your hand; peradventure it was an oversight: 43:13 Take%0aalso your brother, and arise, go again unto the man: 43:14 And God%0aAlmighty give you mercy before the man, that he may send away your%0aother brother, and Benjamin. If I be bereaved of my children, I am%0abereaved.%0a%0a43:15 And the men took that present, and they took double money in%0atheir hand and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt, and%0astood before Joseph.%0a%0a43:16 And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler of%0ahis house, Bring these men home, and slay, and make ready; for these%0amen shall dine with me at noon.%0a%0a43:17 And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men into%0aJoseph's house.%0a%0a43:18 And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph's%0ahouse; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our%0asacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion%0aagainst us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our asses.%0a%0a43:19 And they came near to the steward of Joseph's house, and they%0acommuned with him at the door of the house, 43:20 And said, O sir, we%0acame indeed down at the first time to buy food: 43:21 And it came to%0apass, when we came to the inn, that we opened our sacks, and, behold,%0aevery man's money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full%0aweight: and we have brought it again in our hand.%0a%0a43:22 And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food:%0awe cannot tell who put our money in our sacks.%0a%0a43:23 And he said, Peace be to you, fear not: your God, and the God of%0ayour father, hath given you treasure in your sacks: I had your money.%0aAnd he brought Simeon out unto them.%0a%0a43:24 And the man brought the men into Joseph's house, and gave them%0awater, and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses provender.%0a%0a43:25 And they made ready the present against Joseph came at noon: for%0athey heard that they should eat bread there.%0a%0a43:26 And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which%0awas in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to him to the%0aearth.%0a%0a43:27 And he asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your father%0awell, the old man of whom ye spake? Is he yet alive?  43:28 And they%0aanswered, Thy servant our father is in good health, he is yet alive.%0aAnd they bowed down their heads, and made obeisance.%0a%0a43:29 And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his%0amother's son, and said, Is this your younger brother, of whom ye spake%0aunto me? And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my son.%0a%0a43:30 And Joseph made haste; for his bowels did yearn upon his%0abrother: and he sought where to weep; and he entered into his chamber,%0aand wept there.%0a%0a43:31 And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself, and%0asaid, Set on bread.%0a%0a43:32 And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves,%0aand for the Egyptians, which did eat with him, by themselves: because%0athe Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that is an%0aabomination unto the Egyptians.%0a%0a43:33 And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his%0abirthright, and the youngest according to his youth: and the men%0amarvelled one at another.%0a%0a43:34 And he took and sent messes unto them from before him: but%0aBenjamin's mess was five times so much as any of their's. And they%0adrank, and were merry with him.%0a%0a44:1 And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men's%0asacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put every man's money%0ain his sack's mouth.%0a%0a44:2 And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of the%0ayoungest, and his corn money. And he did according to the word that%0aJoseph had spoken.%0a%0a44:3 As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they%0aand their asses.%0a%0a44:4 And when they were gone out of the city, and not yet far off,%0aJoseph said unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and when thou%0adost overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for%0agood?  44:5 Is not this it in which my lord drinketh, and whereby%0aindeed he divineth? ye have done evil in so doing.%0a%0a44:6 And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these same words.%0a%0a44:7 And they said unto him, Wherefore saith my lord these words? God%0aforbid that thy servants should do according to this thing: 44:8%0aBehold, the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we brought%0aagain unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then should we steal%0aout of thy lord's house silver or gold?  44:9 With whomsoever of thy%0aservants it be found, both let him die, and we also will be my lord's%0abondmen.%0a%0a44:10 And he said, Now also let it be according unto your words: he%0awith whom it is found shall be my servant; and ye shall be blameless.%0a%0a44:11 Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground,%0aand opened every man his sack.%0a%0a44:12 And he searched, and began at the eldest, and left at the%0ayoungest: and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack.%0a%0a44:13 Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and%0areturned to the city.%0a%0a44:14 And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house; for he was%0ayet there: and they fell before him on the ground.%0a%0a44:15 And Joseph said unto them, What deed is this that ye have done?%0awot ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine?  44:16 And Judah%0asaid, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak?  or how%0ashall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy%0aservants: behold, we are my lord's servants, both we, and he also with%0awhom the cup is found.%0a%0a44:17 And he said, God forbid that I should do so: but the man in%0awhose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant; and as for you,%0aget you up in peace unto your father.%0a%0a44:18 Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh my lord, let thy%0aservant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not%0athine anger burn against thy servant: for thou art even as Pharaoh.%0a%0a44:19 My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a%0abrother?  44:20 And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old%0aman, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is%0adead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him.%0a%0a44:21 And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me, that%0aI may set mine eyes upon him.%0a%0a44:22 And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: for%0aif he should leave his father, his father would die.%0a%0a44:23 And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest brother%0acome down with you, ye shall see my face no more.%0a%0a44:24 And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father,%0awe told him the words of my lord.%0a%0a44:25 And our father said, Go again, and buy us a little food.%0a%0a44:26 And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with%0aus, then will we go down: for we may not see the man's face, except%0aour youngest brother be with us.%0a%0a44:27 And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife%0abare me two sons: 44:28 And the one went out from me, and I said,%0aSurely he is torn in pieces; and I saw him not since: 44:29 And if ye%0atake this also from me, and mischief befall him, ye shall bring down%0amy gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.%0a%0a44:30 Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad%0abe not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad's life;%0a44:31 It shall come to pass, when he seeth that the lad is not with%0aus, that he will die: and thy servants shall bring down the gray hairs%0aof thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave.%0a%0a44:32 For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father,%0asaying, If I bring him not unto thee, then I shall bear the blame to%0amy father for ever.%0a%0a44:33 Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of the%0alad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren.%0a%0a44:34 For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad be not with me?%0alest peradventure I see the evil that shall come on my father.%0a%0a45:1 Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood%0aby him; and he cried, Cause every man to go out from me. And there%0astood no man with him, while Joseph made himself known unto his%0abrethren.%0a%0a45:2 And he wept aloud: and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh%0aheard.%0a%0a45:3 And Joseph said unto his brethren, I am Joseph; doth my father%0ayet live? And his brethren could not answer him; for they were%0atroubled at his presence.%0a%0a45:4 And Joseph said unto his brethren, Come near to me, I pray you.%0aAnd they came near. And he said, I am Joseph your brother, whom ye%0asold into Egypt.%0a%0a45:5 Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that ye%0asold me hither: for God did send me before you to preserve life.%0a%0a45:6 For these two years hath the famine been in the land: and yet%0athere are five years, in the which there shall neither be earing nor%0aharvest.%0a%0a45:7 And God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the%0aearth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance.%0a%0a45:8 So now it was not you that sent me hither, but God: and he hath%0amade me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and a ruler%0athroughout all the land of Egypt.%0a%0a45:9 Haste ye, and go up to my father, and say unto him, Thus saith%0athy son Joseph, God hath made me lord of all Egypt: come down unto me,%0atarry not: 45:10 And thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen, and thou%0ashalt be near unto me, thou, and thy children, and thy children's%0achildren, and thy flocks, and thy herds, and all that thou hast: 45:11%0aAnd there will I nourish thee; for yet there are five years of famine;%0alest thou, and thy household, and all that thou hast, come to poverty.%0a%0a45:12 And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin,%0athat it is my mouth that speaketh unto you.%0a%0a45:13 And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all%0athat ye have seen; and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither.%0a%0a45:14 And he fell upon his brother Benjamin's neck, and wept; and%0aBenjamin wept upon his neck.%0a%0a45:15 Moreover he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them: and%0aafter that his brethren talked with him.%0a%0a45:16 And the fame thereof was heard in Pharaoh's house, saying,%0aJoseph's brethren are come: and it pleased Pharaoh well, and his%0aservants.%0a%0a45:17 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Say unto thy brethren, This do ye;%0alade your beasts, and go, get you unto the land of Canaan; 45:18 And%0atake your father and your households, and come unto me: and I will%0agive you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat of%0athe land.%0a%0a45:19 Now thou art commanded, this do ye; take you wagons out of the%0aland of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your%0afather, and come.%0a%0a45:20 Also regard not your stuff; for the good of all the land of%0aEgypt is your's.%0a%0a45:21 And the children of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them wagons,%0aaccording to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for%0athe way.%0a%0a45:22 To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment; but to%0aBenjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver, and five changes of%0araiment.%0a%0a45:23 And to his father he sent after this manner; ten asses laden%0awith the good things of Egypt, and ten she asses laden with corn and%0abread and meat for his father by the way.%0a%0a45:24 So he sent his brethren away, and they departed: and he said%0aunto them, See that ye fall not out by the way.%0a%0a45:25 And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan%0aunto Jacob their father, 45:26 And told him, saying, Joseph is yet%0aalive, and he is governor over all the land of Egypt. And Jacob's%0aheart fainted, for he believed them not.%0a%0a45:27 And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said%0aunto them: and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry%0ahim, the spirit of Jacob their father revived: 45:28 And Israel said,%0aIt is enough; Joseph my son is yet alive: I will go and see him before%0aI die.%0a%0a46:1 And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to%0aBeersheba, and offered sacrifices unto the God of his father Isaac.%0a%0a46:2 And God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night, and said,%0aJacob, Jacob. And he said, Here am I.%0a%0a46:3 And he said, I am God, the God of thy father: fear not to go down%0ainto Egypt; for I will there make of thee a great nation: 46:4 I will%0ago down with thee into Egypt; and I will also surely bring thee up%0aagain: and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes.%0a%0a46:5 And Jacob rose up from Beersheba: and the sons of Israel carried%0aJacob their father, and their little ones, and their wives, in the%0awagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him.%0a%0a46:6 And they took their cattle, and their goods, which they had%0agotten in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob, and all his%0aseed with him: 46:7 His sons, and his sons' sons with him, his%0adaughters, and his sons' daughters, and all his seed brought he with%0ahim into Egypt.%0a%0a46:8 And these are the names of the children of Israel, which came%0ainto Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben, Jacob's firstborn.%0a%0a46:9 And the sons of Reuben; Hanoch, and Phallu, and Hezron, and%0aCarmi.%0a%0a46:10 And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin,%0aand Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman.%0a%0a46:11 And the sons of Levi; Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.%0a%0a46:12 And the sons of Judah; Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Pharez, and%0aZarah: but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. And the sons of%0aPharez were Hezron and Hamul.%0a%0a46:13 And the sons of Issachar; Tola, and Phuvah, and Job, and%0aShimron.%0a%0a46:14 And the sons of Zebulun; Sered, and Elon, and Jahleel.%0a%0a46:15 These be the sons of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob in%0aPadanaram, with his daughter Dinah: all the souls of his sons and his%0adaughters were thirty and three.%0a%0a46:16 And the sons of Gad; Ziphion, and Haggi, Shuni, and Ezbon, Eri,%0aand Arodi, and Areli.%0a%0a46:17 And the sons of Asher; Jimnah, and Ishuah, and Isui, and Beriah,%0aand Serah their sister: and the sons of Beriah; Heber, and Malchiel.%0a%0a46:18 These are the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah his%0adaughter, and these she bare unto Jacob, even sixteen souls.%0a%0a46:19 The sons of Rachel Jacob's wife; Joseph, and Benjamin.%0a%0a46:20 And unto Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and%0aEphraim, which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On bare%0aunto him.%0a%0a46:21 And the sons of Benjamin were Belah, and Becher, and Ashbel,%0aGera, and Naaman, Ehi, and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard.%0a%0a46:22 These are the sons of Rachel, which were born to Jacob: all the%0asouls were fourteen.%0a%0a46:23 And the sons of Dan; Hushim.%0a%0a46:24 And the sons of Naphtali; Jahzeel, and Guni, and Jezer, and%0aShillem.%0a%0a46:25 These are the sons of Bilhah, which Laban gave unto Rachel his%0adaughter, and she bare these unto Jacob: all the souls were seven.%0a%0a46:26 All the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt, which came out of%0ahis loins, besides Jacob's sons' wives, all the souls were threescore%0aand six; 46:27 And the sons of Joseph, which were born him in Egypt,%0awere two souls: all the souls of the house of Jacob, which came into%0aEgypt, were threescore and ten.%0a%0a46:28 And he sent Judah before him unto Joseph, to direct his face%0aunto Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen.%0a%0a46:29 And Joseph made ready his chariot, and went up to meet Israel%0ahis father, to Goshen, and presented himself unto him; and he fell on%0ahis neck, and wept on his neck a good while.%0a%0a46:30 And Israel said unto Joseph, Now let me die, since I have seen%0athy face, because thou art yet alive.%0a%0a46:31 And Joseph said unto his brethren, and unto his father's house,%0aI will go up, and shew Pharaoh, and say unto him, My brethren, and my%0afather's house, which were in the land of Canaan, are come unto me;%0a46:32 And the men are shepherds, for their trade hath been to feed%0acattle; and they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and all%0athat they have.%0a%0a46:33 And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh shall call you, and%0ashall say, What is your occupation?  46:34 That ye shall say, Thy%0aservants' trade hath been about cattle from our youth even until now,%0aboth we, and also our fathers: that ye may dwell in the land of%0aGoshen; for every shepherd is an abomination unto the Egyptians.%0a%0a47:1 Then Joseph came and told Pharaoh, and said, My father and my%0abrethren, and their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have,%0aare come out of the land of Canaan; and, behold, they are in the land%0aof Goshen.%0a%0a47:2 And he took some of his brethren, even five men, and presented%0athem unto Pharaoh.%0a%0a47:3 And Pharaoh said unto his brethren, What is your occupation? And%0athey said unto Pharaoh, Thy servants are shepherds, both we, and also%0aour fathers.%0a%0a47:4 They said morever unto Pharaoh, For to sojourn in the land are we%0acome; for thy servants have no pasture for their flocks; for the%0afamine is sore in the land of Canaan: now therefore, we pray thee, let%0athy servants dwell in the land of Goshen.%0a%0a47:5 And Pharaoh spake unto Joseph, saying, Thy father and thy%0abrethren are come unto thee: 47:6 The land of Egypt is before thee; in%0athe best of the land make thy father and brethren to dwell; in the%0aland of Goshen let them dwell: and if thou knowest any men of activity%0aamong them, then make them rulers over my cattle.%0a%0a47:7 And Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and set him before%0aPharaoh: and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.%0a%0a47:8 And Pharaoh said unto Jacob, How old art thou?  47:9 And Jacob%0asaid unto Pharaoh, The days of the years of my pilgrimage are an%0ahundred and thirty years: few and evil have the days of the years of%0amy life been, and have not attained unto the days of the years of the%0alife of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage.%0a%0a47:10 And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from before Pharaoh.%0a%0a47:11 And Joseph placed his father and his brethren, and gave them a%0apossession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land%0aof Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.%0a%0a47:12 And Joseph nourished his father, and his brethren, and all his%0afather's household, with bread, according to their families.%0a%0a47:13 And there was no bread in all the land; for the famine was very%0asore, so that the land of Egypt and all the land of Canaan fainted by%0areason of the famine.%0a%0a47:14 And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land%0aof Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the corn which they bought:%0aand Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house.%0a%0a47:15 And when money failed in the land of Egypt, and in the land of%0aCanaan, all the Egyptians came unto Joseph, and said, Give us bread:%0afor why should we die in thy presence? for the money faileth.%0a%0a47:16 And Joseph said, Give your cattle; and I will give you for your%0acattle, if money fail.%0a%0a47:17 And they brought their cattle unto Joseph: and Joseph gave them%0abread in exchange for horses, and for the flocks, and for the cattle%0aof the herds, and for the asses: and he fed them with bread for all%0atheir cattle for that year.%0a%0a47:18 When that year was ended, they came unto him the second year,%0aand said unto him, We will not hide it from my lord, how that our%0amoney is spent; my lord also hath our herds of cattle; there is not%0aought left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies, and our lands:%0a47:19 Wherefore shall we die before thine eyes, both we and our land?%0abuy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants%0aunto Pharaoh: and give us seed, that we may live, and not die, that%0athe land be not desolate.%0a%0a47:20 And Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the%0aEgyptians sold every man his field, because the famine prevailed over%0athem: so the land became Pharaoh's.%0a%0a47:21 And as for the people, he removed them to cities from one end of%0athe borders of Egypt even to the other end thereof.%0a%0a47:22 Only the land of the priests bought he not; for the priests had%0aa portion assigned them of Pharaoh, and did eat their portion which%0aPharaoh gave them: wherefore they sold not their lands.%0a%0a47:23 Then Joseph said unto the people, Behold, I have bought you this%0aday and your land for Pharaoh: lo, here is seed for you, and ye shall%0asow the land.%0a%0a47:24 And it shall come to pass in the increase, that ye shall give%0athe fifth part unto Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own, for%0aseed of the field, and for your food, and for them of your households,%0aand for food for your little ones.%0a%0a47:25 And they said, Thou hast saved our lives: let us find grace in%0athe sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh's servants.%0a%0a47:26 And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt unto this day,%0athat Pharaoh should have the fifth part, except the land of the%0apriests only, which became not Pharaoh's.%0a%0a47:27 And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the country of Goshen;%0aand they had possessions therein, and grew, and multiplied%0aexceedingly.%0a%0a47:28 And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years: so the%0awhole age of Jacob was an hundred forty and seven years.%0a%0a47:29 And the time drew nigh that Israel must die: and he called his%0ason Joseph, and said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight,%0aput, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly%0awith me; bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt: 47:30 But I will lie with%0amy fathers, and thou shalt carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their%0aburyingplace. And he said, I will do as thou hast said.%0a%0a47:31 And he said, Swear unto me. And he sware unto him.

And Abel was a keeper of%0a%3c sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.%0a%3c %0a%3c 4:3 And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the%0a%3c fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD.%0a%3c %0a%3c 4:4 And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of%0a%3c the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his%0a%3c offering: 4:5 But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect.%0a%3c And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.%0a%3c %0a%3c 4:6 And the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy%0a%3c countenance fallen?  4:7 If thou doest well, shalt thou not be%0a%3c accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto%0a%3c thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.%0a%3c %0a%3c 4:8 And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when%0a%3c they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother,%0a%3c and slew him.%0a%3c %0a%3c 4:9 And the LORD said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he%0a%3c said, I know not: Am I my brother's keeper?  4:10 And he said, What%0a%3c hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from%0a%3c the ground.%0a%3c %0a%3c 4:11 And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her%0a%3c mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand; 4:12 When thou%0a%3c tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her%0a%3c strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.%0a%3c %0a%3c 4:13 And Cain said unto the LORD, My punishment is greater than I can%0a%3c bear.%0a%3c %0a%3c 4:14 Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the%0a%3c earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and%0a%3c a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one%0a%3c that findeth me shall slay me.%0a%3c %0a%3c 4:15 And the LORD said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain,%0a%3c vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the LORD set a mark%0a%3c upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him.%0a%3c %0a%3c 4:16 And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in the%0a%3c land of Nod, on the east of Eden.%0a%3c %0a%3c 4:17 And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he%0a%3c builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his%0a%3c son, Enoch.%0a%3c %0a%3c 4:18 And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and%0a%3c Mehujael begat Methusael: and Methusael begat Lamech.%0a%3c %0a%3c 4:19 And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was Adah,%0a%3c and the name of the other Zillah.%0a%3c %0a%3c 4:20 And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents,%0a%3c and of such as have cattle.%0a%3c %0a%3c 4:21 And his brother's name was Jubal: he was the father of all such%0a%3c as handle the harp and organ.%0a%3c %0a%3c 4:22 And Zillah, she also bare Tubalcain, an instructer of every%0a%3c artificer in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubalcain was Naamah.%0a%3c %0a%3c 4:23 And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice;%0a%3c ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: for I have slain a man to%0a%3c my wounding, and a young man to my hurt.%0a%3c %0a%3c 4:24 If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and%0a%3c sevenfold.%0a%3c %0a%3c 4:25 And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his%0a%3c name Seth: For God, said she, hath appointed me another seed instead%0a%3c of Abel, whom Cain slew.%0a%3c %0a%3c 4:26 And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his%0a%3c name Enos: then began men to call upon the name of the LORD.%0a%3c %0a%3c 5:1 This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that God%0a%3c created man, in the likeness of God made he him; 5:2 Male and female%0a%3c created he them; and blessed them, and called their name Adam, in the%0a%3c day when they were created.%0a%3c %0a%3c 5:3 And Adam lived an hundred and thirty years, and begat a son in his%0a%3c own likeness, and after his image; and called his name Seth: 5:4 And%0a%3c the days of Adam after he had begotten Seth were eight hundred years:%0a%3c and he begat sons and daughters: 5:5 And all the days that Adam lived%0a%3c were nine hundred and thirty years: and he died.%0a%3c %0a%3c 5:6 And Seth lived an hundred and five years, and begat Enos: 5:7 And%0a%3c Seth lived after he begat Enos eight hundred and seven years, and%0a%3c begat sons and daughters: 5:8 And all the days of Seth were nine%0a%3c hundred and twelve years: and he died.%0a%3c %0a%3c 5:9 And Enos lived ninety years, and begat Cainan: 5:10 And Enos lived%0a%3c after he begat Cainan eight hundred and fifteen years, and begat sons%0a%3c and daughters: 5:11 And all the days of Enos were nine hundred and%0a%3c five years: and he died.%0a%3c %0a%3c 5:12 And Cainan lived seventy years and begat Mahalaleel: 5:13 And%0a%3c Cainan lived after he begat Mahalaleel eight hundred and forty years,%0a%3c and begat sons and daughters: 5:14 And all the days of Cainan were%0a%3c nine hundred and ten years: and he died.%0a%3c %0a%3c 5:15 And Mahalaleel lived sixty and five years, and begat Jared: 5:16%0a%3c And Mahalaleel lived after he begat Jared eight hundred and thirty%0a%3c years, and begat sons and daughters: 5:17 And all the days of%0a%3c Mahalaleel were eight hundred ninety and five years: and he died.%0a%3c %0a%3c 5:18 And Jared lived an hundred sixty and two years, and he begat%0a%3c Enoch: 5:19 And Jared lived after he begat Enoch eight hundred years,%0a%3c and begat sons and daughters: 5:20 And all the days of Jared were nine%0a%3c hundred sixty and two years: and he died.%0a%3c %0a%3c 5:21 And Enoch lived sixty and five years, and begat Methuselah: 5:22%0a%3c And Enoch walked with God after he begat Methuselah three hundred%0a%3c years, and begat sons and daughters: 5:23 And all the days of Enoch%0a%3c were three hundred sixty and five years: 5:24 And Enoch walked with%0a%3c God: and he was not; for God took him.%0a%3c %0a%3c 5:25 And Methuselah lived an hundred eighty and seven years, and begat%0a%3c Lamech.%0a%3c %0a%3c 5:26 And Methuselah lived after he begat Lamech seven hundred eighty%0a%3c and two years, and begat sons and daughters: 5:27 And all the days of%0a%3c Methuselah were nine hundred sixty and nine years: and he died.%0a%3c %0a%3c 5:28 And Lamech lived an hundred eighty and two years, and begat a%0a%3c son: 5:29 And he called his name Noah, saying, This same shall comfort%0a%3c us concerning our work and toil of our hands, because of the ground%0a%3c which the LORD hath cursed.%0a%3c %0a%3c 5:30 And Lamech lived after he begat Noah five hundred ninety and five%0a%3c years, and begat sons and daughters: 5:31 And all the days of Lamech%0a%3c were seven hundred seventy and seven years: and he died.%0a%3c %0a%3c 5:32 And Noah was five hundred years old: and Noah begat Shem, Ham,%0a%3c and Japheth.%0a%3c %0a%3c 6:1 And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the%0a%3c earth, and daughters were born unto them, 6:2 That the sons of God saw%0a%3c the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of%0a%3c all which they chose.%0a%3c %0a%3c 6:3 And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for%0a%3c that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty%0a%3c years.%0a%3c %0a%3c 6:4 There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that,%0a%3c when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare%0a%3c children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of%0a%3c renown.%0a%3c %0a%3c 6:5 And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and%0a%3c that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil%0a%3c continually.%0a%3c %0a%3c 6:6 And it repented the LORD that he had made man on the earth, and it%0a%3c grieved him at his heart.%0a%3c %0a%3c 6:7 And the LORD said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the%0a%3c face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and%0a%3c the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.%0a%3c %0a%3c 6:8 But Noah found grace in the eyes of the LORD.%0a%3c %0a%3c 6:9 These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and perfect%0a%3c in his generations, and Noah walked with God.%0a%3c %0a%3c 6:10 And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.%0a%3c %0a%3c 6:11 The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled%0a%3c with violence.%0a%3c %0a%3c 6:12 And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for%0a%3c all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.%0a%3c %0a%3c 6:13 And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me;%0a%3c for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I%0a%3c will destroy them with the earth.%0a%3c %0a%3c 6:14 Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the%0a%3c ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.%0a%3c %0a%3c 6:15 And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The length%0a%3c of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty%0a%3c cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.%0a%3c %0a%3c 6:16 A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou%0a%3c finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side%0a%3c thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.%0a%3c %0a%3c 6:17 And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the%0a%3c earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under%0a%3c heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall die.%0a%3c %0a%3c 6:18 But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come%0a%3c into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives%0a%3c with thee.%0a%3c %0a%3c 6:19 And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt%0a%3c thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be%0a%3c male and female.%0a%3c %0a%3c 6:20 Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of%0a%3c every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort%0a%3c shall come unto thee, to keep them alive.%0a%3c %0a%3c 6:21 And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt%0a%3c gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.%0a%3c %0a%3c 6:22 Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so did%0a%3c he.%0a%3c %0a%3c 7:1 And the LORD said unto Noah, Come thou and all thy house into the%0a%3c ark; for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation.%0a%3c %0a%3c 7:2 Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the male%0a%3c and his female: and of beasts that are not clean by two, the male and%0a%3c his female.%0a%3c %0a%3c 7:3 Of fowls also of the air by sevens, the male and the female; to%0a%3c keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth.%0a%3c %0a%3c 7:4 For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth%0a%3c forty days and forty nights; and every living substance that I have%0a%3c made will I destroy from off the face of the earth.%0a%3c %0a%3c 7:5 And Noah did according unto all that the LORD commanded him.%0a%3c %0a%3c 7:6 And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was%0a%3c upon the earth.%0a%3c %0a%3c 7:7 And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives%0a%3c with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.%0a%3c %0a%3c 7:8 Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of fowls,%0a%3c and of every thing that creepeth upon the earth, 7:9 There went in two%0a%3c and two unto Noah into the ark, the male and the female, as God had%0a%3c commanded Noah.%0a%3c %0a%3c 7:10 And it came to pass after seven days, that the waters of the%0a%3c flood were upon the earth.%0a%3c %0a%3c 7:11 In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month,%0a%3c the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains%0a%3c of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.%0a%3c %0a%3c 7:12 And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights.%0a%3c %0a%3c 7:13 In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth,%0a%3c the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the three wives of his sons%0a%3c with them, into the ark; 7:14 They, and every beast after his kind,%0a%3c and all the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing that%0a%3c creepeth upon the earth after his kind, and every fowl after his kind,%0a%3c every bird of every sort.%0a%3c %0a%3c 7:15 And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of all%0a%3c flesh, wherein is the breath of life.%0a%3c %0a%3c 7:16 And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as%0a%3c God had commanded him: and the LORD shut him in.%0a%3c %0a%3c 7:17 And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters%0a%3c increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth.%0a%3c %0a%3c 7:18 And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the%0a%3c earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters.%0a%3c %0a%3c 7:19 And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the%0a%3c high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered.%0a%3c %0a%3c 7:20 Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains%0a%3c were covered.%0a%3c %0a%3c 7:21 And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and%0a%3c of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth%0a%3c upon the earth, and every man: 7:22 All in whose nostrils was the%0a%3c breath of life, of all that was in the dry land, died.%0a%3c %0a%3c 7:23 And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face%0a%3c of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the%0a%3c fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah%0a%3c only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.%0a%3c %0a%3c 7:24 And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty%0a%3c days.%0a%3c %0a%3c 8:1 And God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the%0a%3c cattle that was with him in the ark: and God made a wind to pass over%0a%3c the earth, and the waters asswaged; 8:2 The fountains also of the deep%0a%3c and the windows of heaven were stopped, and the rain from heaven was%0a%3c restrained; 8:3 And the waters returned from off the earth%0a%3c continually: and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the%0a%3c waters were abated.%0a%3c %0a%3c 8:4 And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of%0a%3c the month, upon the mountains of Ararat.%0a%3c %0a%3c 8:5 And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in the%0a%3c tenth month, on the first day of the month, were the tops of the%0a%3c mountains seen.%0a%3c %0a%3c 8:6 And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the%0a%3c window of the ark which he had made: 8:7 And he sent forth a raven,%0a%3c which went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from off%0a%3c the earth.%0a%3c %0a%3c 8:8 Also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were%0a%3c abated from off the face of the ground; 8:9 But the dove found no rest%0a%3c for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him into the ark, for%0a%3c the waters were on the face of the whole earth: then he put forth his%0a%3c hand, and took her, and pulled her in unto him into the ark.%0a%3c %0a%3c 8:10 And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the%0a%3c dove out of the ark; 8:11 And the dove came in to him in the evening;%0a%3c and, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf pluckt off: so Noah knew that%0a%3c the waters were abated from off the earth.%0a%3c %0a%3c 8:12 And he stayed yet other seven days; and sent forth the dove;%0a%3c which returned not again unto him any more.%0a%3c %0a%3c 8:13 And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the%0a%3c first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from%0a%3c off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked,%0a%3c and, behold, the face of the ground was dry.%0a%3c %0a%3c 8:14 And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the%0a%3c month, was the earth dried.%0a%3c %0a%3c 8:15 And God spake unto Noah, saying, 8:16 Go forth of the ark, thou,%0a%3c and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons' wives with thee.%0a%3c %0a%3c 8:17 Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of%0a%3c all flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing%0a%3c that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the%0a%3c earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.%0a%3c %0a%3c 8:18 And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons'%0a%3c wives with him: 8:19 Every beast, every creeping thing, and every%0a%3c fowl, and whatsoever creepeth upon the earth, after their kinds, went%0a%3c forth out of the ark.%0a%3c %0a%3c 8:20 And Noah builded an altar unto the LORD; and took of every clean%0a%3c beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the%0a%3c altar.%0a%3c %0a%3c 8:21 And the LORD smelled a sweet savour; and the LORD said in his%0a%3c heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake; for%0a%3c the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth; neither will I%0a%3c again smite any more every thing living, as I have done.%0a%3c %0a%3c 8:22 While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and%0a%3c heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease.%0a%3c %0a%3c 9:1 And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be%0a%3c fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.%0a%3c %0a%3c 9:2 And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast%0a%3c of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth%0a%3c upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are%0a%3c they delivered.%0a%3c %0a%3c 9:3 Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as the%0a%3c green herb have I given you all things.%0a%3c %0a%3c 9:4 But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall%0a%3c ye not eat.%0a%3c %0a%3c 9:5 And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of%0a%3c every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of%0a%3c every man's brother will I require the life of man.%0a%3c %0a%3c 9:6 Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in%0a%3c the image of God made he man.%0a%3c %0a%3c 9:7 And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly in%0a%3c the earth, and multiply therein.%0a%3c %0a%3c 9:8 And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying, 9:9 And%0a%3c I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after%0a%3c you; 9:10 And with every living creature that is with you, of the%0a%3c fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from%0a%3c all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth.%0a%3c %0a%3c 9:11 And I will establish my covenant with you, neither shall all%0a%3c flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall%0a%3c there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.%0a%3c %0a%3c 9:12 And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make%0a%3c between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for%0a%3c perpetual generations: 9:13 I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall%0a%3c be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth.%0a%3c %0a%3c 9:14 And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth,%0a%3c that the bow shall be seen in the cloud: 9:15 And I will remember my%0a%3c covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all%0a%3c flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all%0a%3c flesh.%0a%3c %0a%3c 9:16 And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that%0a%3c I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living%0a%3c creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.%0a%3c %0a%3c 9:17 And God said unto Noah, This is the token of the covenant, which%0a%3c I have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth.%0a%3c %0a%3c 9:18 And the sons of Noah, that went forth of the ark, were Shem, and%0a%3c Ham, and Japheth: and Ham is the father of Canaan.%0a%3c %0a%3c 9:19 These are the three sons of Noah: and of them was the whole earth%0a%3c overspread.%0a%3c %0a%3c 9:20 And Noah began to be an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard:%0a%3c 9:21 And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered%0a%3c within his tent.%0a%3c %0a%3c 9:22 And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father,%0a%3c and told his two brethren without.%0a%3c %0a%3c 9:23 And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their%0a%3c shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their%0a%3c father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's%0a%3c nakedness.%0a%3c %0a%3c 9:24 And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had%0a%3c done unto him.%0a%3c %0a%3c 9:25 And he said, Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be%0a%3c unto his brethren.%0a%3c %0a%3c 9:26 And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Shem; and Canaan shall be%0a%3c his servant.%0a%3c %0a%3c 9:27 God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of%0a%3c Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.%0a%3c %0a%3c 9:28 And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.%0a%3c %0a%3c 9:29 And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years: and%0a%3c he died.%0a%3c %0a%3c 10:1 Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham, and%0a%3c Japheth: and unto them were sons born after the flood.%0a%3c %0a%3c 10:2 The sons of Japheth;

and they dwelt there.%0a%3c %0a%3c 11:3 And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn%0a%3c them thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for%0a%3c morter.%0a%3c %0a%3c 11:4 And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose%0a%3c top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be%0a%3c scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.%0a%3c %0a%3c 11:5 And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the%0a%3c children of men builded.%0a%3c %0a%3c 11:6 And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all%0a%3c one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be%0a%3c restrained from them, which they have imagined to do.%0a%3c %0a%3c 11:7 Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that%0a%3c they may not understand one another's speech.%0a%3c %0a%3c 11:8 So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of%0a%3c all the earth: and they left off to build the city.%0a%3c %0a%3c 11:9 Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the LORD did%0a%3c there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did the%0a%3c LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.%0a%3c %0a%3c 11:10 These are the generations of Shem: Shem was an hundred years%0a%3c old, and begat Arphaxad two years after the flood: 11:11 And Shem%0a%3c lived after he begat Arphaxad five hundred years, and begat sons and%0a%3c daughters.%0a%3c %0a%3c 11:12 And Arphaxad lived five and thirty years, and begat Salah: 11:13%0a%3c And Arphaxad lived after he begat Salah four hundred and three years,%0a%3c and begat sons and daughters.%0a%3c %0a%3c 11:14 And Salah lived thirty years, and begat Eber: 11:15 And Salah%0a%3c lived after he begat Eber four hundred and three years, and begat sons%0a%3c and daughters.%0a%3c %0a%3c 11:16 And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg: 11:17 And%0a%3c Eber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty years, and%0a%3c begat sons and daughters.%0a%3c %0a%3c 11:18 And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu: 11:19 And Peleg%0a%3c lived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years, and begat sons%0a%3c and daughters.%0a%3c %0a%3c 11:20 And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug: 11:21 And%0a%3c Reu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven years, and begat%0a%3c sons and daughters.%0a%3c %0a%3c 11:22 And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor: 11:23 And Serug%0a%3c lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years, and begat sons and%0a%3c daughters.%0a%3c %0a%3c 11:24 And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah: 11:25%0a%3c And Nahor lived after he begat Terah an hundred and nineteen years,%0a%3c and begat sons and daughters.%0a%3c %0a%3c 11:26 And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and%0a%3c Haran.%0a%3c %0a%3c 11:27 Now these are the generations of Terah: Terah begat Abram,%0a%3c Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begat Lot.%0a%3c %0a%3c 11:28 And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his%0a%3c nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees.%0a%3c %0a%3c 11:29 And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram's wife%0a%3c was Sarai; and the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah, the daughter of%0a%3c Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah.%0a%3c %0a%3c 11:30 But Sarai was barren; she had no child.%0a%3c %0a%3c 11:31 And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's%0a%3c son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and they%0a%3c went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of%0a%3c Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.%0a%3c %0a%3c 11:32 And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah%0a%3c died in Haran.%0a%3c %0a%3c 12:1 Now the LORD had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country,%0a%3c and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I%0a%3c will shew thee: 12:2 And I will make of thee a great nation, and I%0a%3c will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a%0a%3c blessing: 12:3 And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him%0a%3c that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be%0a%3c blessed.%0a%3c %0a%3c 12:4 So Abram departed, as the LORD had spoken unto him; and Lot went%0a%3c with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed%0a%3c out of Haran.%0a%3c %0a%3c 12:5 And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all%0a%3c their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had%0a%3c gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan;%0a%3c and into the land of Canaan they came.%0a%3c %0a%3c 12:6 And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Sichem, unto%0a%3c the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.%0a%3c %0a%3c 12:7 And the LORD appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I%0a%3c give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the LORD, who%0a%3c appeared unto him.%0a%3c %0a%3c 12:8 And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Bethel,%0a%3c and pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and Hai on the east:%0a%3c and there he builded an altar unto the LORD, and called upon the name%0a%3c of the LORD.%0a%3c %0a%3c 12:9 And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south.%0a%3c %0a%3c 12:10 And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into%0a%3c Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land.%0a%3c %0a%3c 12:11 And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt,%0a%3c that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a%0a%3c fair woman to look upon: 12:12 Therefore it shall come to pass, when%0a%3c the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This is his wife:%0a%3c and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.%0a%3c %0a%3c 12:13 Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with%0a%3c me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.%0a%3c %0a%3c 12:14 And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the%0a%3c Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.%0a%3c %0a%3c 12:15 The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before%0a%3c Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.%0a%3c %0a%3c 12:16 And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and%0a%3c oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses,%0a%3c and camels.%0a%3c %0a%3c 12:17 And the LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues%0a%3c because of Sarai Abram's wife.%0a%3c %0a%3c 12:18 And Pharaoh called Abram and said, What is this that thou hast%0a%3c done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?  12:19%0a%3c Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me to%0a%3c wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.%0a%3c %0a%3c 12:20 And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him%0a%3c away, and his wife, and all that he had.%0a%3c %0a%3c 13:1 And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that he%0a%3c had, and Lot with him, into the south.%0a%3c %0a%3c 13:2 And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold.%0a%3c %0a%3c 13:3 And he went on his journeys from the south even to Bethel, unto%0a%3c the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and%0a%3c Hai; 13:4 Unto the place of the altar, which he had make there at the%0a%3c first: and there Abram called on the name of the LORD.%0a%3c %0a%3c 13:5 And Lot also, which went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and%0a%3c tents.%0a%3c %0a%3c 13:6 And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell%0a%3c together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell%0a%3c together.%0a%3c %0a%3c 13:7 And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram's cattle and%0a%3c the herdmen of Lot's cattle: and the Canaanite and the Perizzite%0a%3c dwelled then in the land.%0a%3c %0a%3c 13:8 And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee,%0a%3c between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen; for we be%0a%3c brethren.%0a%3c %0a%3c 13:9 Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee,%0a%3c from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right;%0a%3c or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left.%0a%3c %0a%3c 13:10 And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan,%0a%3c that it was well watered every where, before the LORD destroyed Sodom%0a%3c and Gomorrah, even as the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt,%0a%3c as thou comest unto Zoar.%0a%3c %0a%3c 13:11 Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed%0a%3c east: and they separated themselves the one from the other.%0a%3c %0a%3c 13:12 Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in the%0a%3c cities of the plain, and pitched his tent toward Sodom.%0a%3c %0a%3c 13:13 But the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the LORD%0a%3c exceedingly.%0a%3c %0a%3c 13:14 And the LORD said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated from%0a%3c him, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art%0a%3c northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward: 13:15 For all%0a%3c the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for%0a%3c ever.%0a%3c %0a%3c 13:16 And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a%0a%3c man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be%0a%3c numbered.%0a%3c %0a%3c 13:17 Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the%0a%3c breadth of it; for I will give it unto thee.%0a%3c %0a%3c 13:18 Then Abram removed his tent, and came and dwelt in the plain of%0a%3c Mamre, which is in Hebron, and built there an altar unto the LORD.%0a%3c %0a%3c 14:1 And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar,%0a%3c Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of%0a%3c nations; 14:2 That these made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with%0a%3c Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of%0a%3c Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar.%0a%3c %0a%3c 14:3 All these were joined together in the vale of Siddim, which is%0a%3c the salt sea.%0a%3c %0a%3c 14:4 Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year%0a%3c they rebelled.%0a%3c %0a%3c 14:5 And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that%0a%3c were with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the%0a%3c Zuzims in Ham, and the Emins in Shaveh Kiriathaim, 14:6 And the%0a%3c Horites in their mount Seir, unto Elparan, which is by the wilderness.%0a%3c %0a%3c 14:7 And they returned, and came to Enmishpat, which is Kadesh, and%0a%3c smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that%0a%3c dwelt in Hazezontamar.%0a%3c %0a%3c 14:8 And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah,%0a%3c and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela%0a%3c (the same is Zoar;) and they joined battle with them in the vale of%0a%3c Siddim; 14:9 With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king%0a%3c of nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar;%0a%3c four kings with five.%0a%3c %0a%3c 14:10 And the vale of Siddim was full of slimepits; and the kings of%0a%3c Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remained fled%0a%3c to the mountain.%0a%3c %0a%3c 14:11 And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their%0a%3c victuals, and went their way.%0a%3c %0a%3c 14:12 And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom,%0a%3c and his goods, and departed.%0a%3c %0a%3c 14:13 And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew;%0a%3c for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and%0a%3c brother of Aner: and these were confederate with Abram.%0a%3c %0a%3c 14:14 And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he%0a%3c armed his trained servants, born in his own house, three hundred and%0a%3c eighteen, and pursued them unto Dan.%0a%3c %0a%3c 14:15 And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by%0a%3c night, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the%0a%3c left hand of Damascus.%0a%3c %0a%3c 14:16 And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his%0a%3c brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people.%0a%3c %0a%3c 14:17 And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from%0a%3c the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that were with him, at%0a%3c the valley of Shaveh, which is the king's dale.%0a%3c %0a%3c 14:18 And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and%0a%3c he was the priest of the most high God.%0a%3c %0a%3c 14:19 And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high%0a%3c God, possessor of heaven and earth: 14:20 And blessed be the most high%0a%3c God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him%0a%3c tithes of all.%0a%3c %0a%3c 14:21 And the king of Sodom said unto Abram, Give me the persons, and%0a%3c take the goods to thyself.%0a%3c %0a%3c 14:22 And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand%0a%3c unto the LORD, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth,%0a%3c 14:23 That I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and%0a%3c that I will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou shouldest say,%0a%3c I have made Abram rich: 14:24 Save only that which the young men have%0a%3c eaten, and the portion of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol,%0a%3c and Mamre; let them take their portion.%0a%3c %0a%3c 15:1 After these things the word of the LORD came unto Abram in a%0a%3c vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding%0a%3c great reward.%0a%3c %0a%3c 15:2 And Abram said, LORD God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go%0a%3c childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?%0a%3c 15:3 And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo,%0a%3c one born in my house is mine heir.%0a%3c %0a%3c 15:4 And, behold, the word of the LORD came unto him, saying, This%0a%3c shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own%0a%3c bowels shall be thine heir.%0a%3c %0a%3c 15:5 And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward%0a%3c heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he%0a%3c said unto him, So shall thy seed be.%0a%3c %0a%3c 15:6 And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for%0a%3c righteousness.%0a%3c %0a%3c 15:7 And he said unto him, I am the LORD that brought thee out of Ur%0a%3c of the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it.%0a%3c %0a%3c 15:8 And he said, LORD God, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit%0a%3c it?  15:9 And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old,%0a%3c and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a%0a%3c turtledove, and a young pigeon.%0a%3c %0a%3c 15:10 And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst,%0a%3c and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not.%0a%3c %0a%3c 15:11 And when the fowls came down upon the carcases, Abram drove them%0a%3c away.%0a%3c %0a%3c 15:12 And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram;%0a%3c and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.%0a%3c %0a%3c 15:13 And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be%0a%3c a stranger in a land that is not their's, and shall serve them; and%0a%3c they shall afflict them four hundred years; 15:14 And also that%0a%3c nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they%0a%3c come out with great substance.%0a%3c %0a%3c 15:15 And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried%0a%3c in a good old age.%0a%3c %0a%3c 15:16 But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for%0a%3c the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.%0a%3c %0a%3c 15:17 And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was%0a%3c dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between%0a%3c those pieces.%0a%3c %0a%3c 15:18 In the same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying,%0a%3c Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the%0a%3c great river, the river Euphrates: 15:19 The Kenites, and the%0a%3c Kenizzites, and the Kadmonites, 15:20 And the Hittites, and the%0a%3c Perizzites, and the Rephaims, 15:21 And the Amorites, and the%0a%3c Canaanites, and the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.%0a%3c %0a%3c 16:1 Now Sarai Abram's wife bare him no children: and she had an%0a%3c handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar.%0a%3c %0a%3c 16:2 And Sarai said unto Abram, Behold now, the LORD hath restrained%0a%3c me from bearing: I pray thee, go in unto my maid; it may be that I may%0a%3c obtain children by her. And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai.%0a%3c %0a%3c 16:3 And Sarai Abram's wife took Hagar her maid the Egyptian, after%0a%3c Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to her%0a%3c husband Abram to be his wife.%0a%3c %0a%3c 16:4 And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw%0a%3c that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.%0a%3c %0a%3c 16:5 And Sarai said unto Abram, My wrong be upon thee: I have given my%0a%3c maid into thy bosom; and when she saw that she had conceived, I was%0a%3c despised in her eyes: the LORD judge between me and thee.%0a%3c %0a%3c 16:6 But Abram said unto Sarai, Behold, thy maid is in thine hand; do%0a%3c to her as it pleaseth thee. And when Sarai dealt hardly with her, she%0a%3c fled from her face.%0a%3c %0a%3c 16:7 And the angel of the LORD found her by a fountain of water in the%0a%3c wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur.%0a%3c %0a%3c 16:8 And he said, Hagar, Sarai's maid, whence camest thou? and whither%0a%3c wilt thou go? And she said, I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai.%0a%3c %0a%3c 16:9 And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Return to thy mistress,%0a%3c and submit thyself under her hands.%0a%3c %0a%3c 16:10 And the angel of the LORD said unto her, I will multiply thy%0a%3c seed exceedingly, that it shall not be numbered for multitude.%0a%3c %0a%3c 16:11 And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Behold, thou art with%0a%3c child and shalt bear a son, and shalt call his name Ishmael; because%0a%3c the LORD hath heard thy affliction.%0a%3c %0a%3c 16:12 And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man,%0a%3c and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence%0a%3c of all his brethren.%0a%3c %0a%3c 16:13 And she called the name of the LORD that spake unto her, Thou%0a%3c God seest me: for she said, Have I also here looked after him that%0a%3c seeth me?  16:14 Wherefore the well was called Beerlahairoi; behold,%0a%3c it is between Kadesh and Bered.%0a%3c %0a%3c 16:15 And Hagar bare Abram a son: and Abram called his son's name,%0a%3c which Hagar bare, Ishmael.%0a%3c %0a%3c 16:16 And Abram was fourscore and six years old, when Hagar bare%0a%3c Ishmael to Abram.%0a%3c %0a%3c 17:1 And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the LORD appeared%0a%3c to Abram, and said unto him, I am the Almighty God; walk before me,%0a%3c and be thou perfect.%0a%3c %0a%3c 17:2 And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will%0a%3c multiply thee exceedingly.%0a%3c %0a%3c 17:3 And Abram fell on his face: and God talked with him, saying, 17:4%0a%3c As for me, behold, my covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be a%0a%3c father of many nations.%0a%3c %0a%3c 17:5 Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name%0a%3c shall be Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made thee.%0a%3c %0a%3c 17:6 And I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make nations%0a%3c of thee, and kings shall come out of thee.%0a%3c %0a%3c 17:7 And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed%0a%3c after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a%0a%3c God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.%0a%3c %0a%3c 17:8 And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land%0a%3c wherein thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for an%0a%3c everlasting possession; and I will be their God.%0a%3c %0a%3c 17:9 And God said unto Abraham, Thou shalt keep my covenant therefore,%0a%3c thou, and thy seed after thee in their generations.%0a%3c %0a%3c 17:10 This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and%0a%3c thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised.%0a%3c %0a%3c 17:11 And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall%0a%3c be a token of the covenant betwixt me and you.%0a%3c %0a%3c 17:12 And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you,%0a%3c every man child in your generations, he that is born in the house, or%0a%3c bought with money of any stranger, which is not of thy seed.%0a%3c %0a%3c 17:13 He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy%0a%3c money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your%0a%3c flesh for an everlasting covenant.%0a%3c %0a%3c 17:14 And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is%0a%3c not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath%0a%3c broken my covenant.%0a%3c %0a%3c 17:15 And God said unto Abraham, As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not%0a%3c call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall her name be.%0a%3c %0a%3c 17:16 And I will bless her, and give thee a son also of her: yea, I%0a%3c will bless her, and she shall be a mother of nations; kings of people%0a%3c shall be of her.%0a%3c %0a%3c 17:17 Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his%0a%3c heart, Shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old?%0a%3c and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?  17:18 And Abraham%0a%3c said unto God, O that Ishmael might live before thee!  17:19 And God%0a%3c said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt call%0a%3c his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an%0a%3c everlasting covenant, and with his seed after him.%0a%3c %0a%3c 17:20 And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed%0a%3c him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly;%0a%3c twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation.%0a%3c %0a%3c 17:21 But my covenant will I establish with Isaac, which Sarah shall%0a%3c bear unto thee at this set time in the next year.%0a%3c %0a%3c 17:22 And he left off talking with him, and God went up from Abraham.%0a%3c %0a%3c 17:23 And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his%0a%3c house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the%0a%3c men of Abraham's house; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in%0a%3c the selfsame day, as God had said unto him.%0a%3c %0a%3c 17:24 And Abraham was ninety years old and nine, when he was%0a%3c circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.%0a%3c %0a%3c 17:25 And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old, when he was%0a%3c circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.%0a%3c %0a%3c 17:26 In the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his%0a%3c son.%0a%3c %0a%3c 17:27 And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with%0a%3c money of the stranger, were circumcised with him.%0a%3c %0a%3c 18:1 And the LORD appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre: and he sat%0a%3c in the tent door in the heat of the day; 18:2 And he lift up his eyes%0a%3c and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw them, he%0a%3c ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the%0a%3c ground, 18:3 And said, My LORD, if now I have found favour in thy%0a%3c sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant: 18:4 Let a little%0a%3c water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves%0a%3c under the tree: 18:5 And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort%0a%3c ye your hearts; after that ye shall pass on: for therefore are ye come%0a%3c to your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said.%0a%3c %0a%3c 18:6 And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make%0a%3c ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes%0a%3c upon the hearth.%0a%3c %0a%3c 18:7 And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetcht a calf tender and good,%0a%3c and gave it unto a young man; and he hasted to dress it.%0a%3c %0a%3c 18:8 And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed,%0a%3c and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they%0a%3c did eat.%0a%3c %0a%3c 18:9 And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said,%0a%3c Behold, in the tent.%0a%3c %0a%3c 18:10 And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the%0a%3c time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah%0a%3c heard it in the tent door, which was behind him.%0a%3c %0a%3c 18:11 Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age; and it%0a%3c ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.%0a%3c %0a%3c 18:12 Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed%0a%3c old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?  18:13 And the LORD%0a%3c said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a%0a%3c surety bear a child, which am old?  18:14 Is any thing too hard for%0a%3c the LORD? At the time appointed I will return unto thee, according to%0a%3c the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son.%0a%3c %0a%3c 18:15 Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid.%0a%3c And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.%0a%3c %0a%3c 18:16 And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and%0a%3c Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.%0a%3c %0a%3c 18:17 And the LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I%0a%3c do; 18:18 Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty%0a%3c nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?%0a%3c 18:19 For I know him, that he will command his children and his%0a%3c household after him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD, to do%0a%3c justice and judgment; that the LORD may bring upon Abraham that which%0a%3c he hath spoken of him.%0a%3c %0a%3c 18:20 And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is%0a%3c great, and because their sin is very grievous; 18:21 I will go down%0a%3c now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of%0a%3c it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.%0a%3c %0a%3c 18:22 And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward%0a%3c Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the LORD.%0a%3c %0a%3c 18:23 And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the%0a%3c righteous with the wicked?  18:24 Peradventure there be fifty%0a%3c righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the%0a%3c place for the fifty righteous that are therein?  18:25 That be far%0a%3c from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the%0a%3c wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far%0a%3c from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?  18:26 And%0a%3c the LORD said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city,%0a%3c then I will spare all the place for their sakes.%0a%3c %0a%3c 18:27 And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me%0a%3c to speak unto the LORD, which am but dust and ashes: 18:28%0a%3c Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou%0a%3c destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said, If I find there%0a%3c forty and five, I will not destroy it.%0a%3c %0a%3c 18:29 And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there%0a%3c shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty's%0a%3c sake.%0a%3c %0a%3c 18:30 And he said unto him, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will%0a%3c speak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he said, I%0a%3c will not do it, if I find thirty there.%0a%3c %0a%3c 18:31 And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the%0a%3c LORD: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I%0a%3c will not destroy it for twenty's sake.%0a%3c %0a%3c 18:32 And he said, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will speak yet%0a%3c but this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I%0a%3c will not destroy it for ten's sake.%0a%3c %0a%3c 18:33 And the LORD went his way, as soon as he had left communing with%0a%3c Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place.%0a%3c %0a%3c 19:1 And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the%0a%3c gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and he bowed%0a%3c himself with his face toward the ground; 19:2 And he said, Behold now,%0a%3c my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant's house, and tarry%0a%3c all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on%0a%3c your ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all%0a%3c night.%0a%3c %0a%3c 19:3 And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him,%0a%3c and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake%0a%3c unleavened bread, and they did eat.%0a%3c %0a%3c 19:4 But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of%0a%3c Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people%0a%3c from every quarter: 19:5 And they called unto Lot, and said unto him,%0a%3c Where are the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out%0a%3c unto us, that we may know them.%0a%3c %0a%3c 19:6 And Lot went out at the door unto them, and shut the door after%0a%3c him, 19:7 And said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly.%0a%3c %0a%3c 19:8 Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let%0a%3c me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good%0a%3c in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for therefore came they%0a%3c under the shadow of my roof.%0a%3c %0a%3c 19:9 And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one fellow%0a%3c came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal%0a%3c worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man,%0a%3c even Lot, and came near to break the door.%0a%3c %0a%3c 19:10 But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house%0a%3c to them, and shut to the door.%0a%3c %0a%3c 19:11 And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with%0a%3c blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to%0a%3c find the door.%0a%3c %0a%3c 19:12 And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in%0a%3c law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the%0a%3c city, bring them out of this place: 19:13 For we will destroy this%0a%3c place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the%0a%3c LORD; and the LORD hath sent us to destroy it.%0a%3c %0a%3c 19:14 And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married%0a%3c his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the LORD%0a%3c will destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons%0a%3c in law.%0a%3c %0a%3c 19:15 And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot,%0a%3c saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here;%0a%3c lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.%0a%3c %0a%3c 19:16 And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon%0a%3c the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the LORD%0a%3c being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him%0a%3c without the city.%0a%3c %0a%3c 19:17 And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad,%0a%3c that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay%0a%3c thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.%0a%3c %0a%3c 19:18 And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my LORD: 19:19 Behold now,%0a%3c thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy%0a%3c mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot%0a%3c escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die: 19:20%0a%3c Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one:%0a%3c Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and my soul shall%0a%3c live.%0a%3c %0a%3c 19:21 And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this%0a%3c thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thou%0a%3c hast spoken.%0a%3c %0a%3c 19:22 Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do anything till thou%0a%3c be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.%0a%3c %0a%3c 19:23 The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar.%0a%3c %0a%3c 19:24 Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and%0a%3c fire from the LORD out of heaven; 19:25 And he overthrew those cities,%0a%3c and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that%0a%3c which grew upon the ground.%0a%3c %0a%3c 19:26 But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a%0a%3c pillar of salt.%0a%3c %0a%3c 19:27 And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he%0a%3c stood before the LORD: 19:28 And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah,%0a%3c and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke%0a%3c of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.%0a%3c %0a%3c 19:29 And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain,%0a%3c that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the%0a%3c overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt.%0a%3c %0a%3c 19:30 And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his%0a%3c two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt%0a%3c in a cave, he and his two daughters.%0a%3c %0a%3c 19:31 And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old, and%0a%3c there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of%0a%3c all the earth: 19:32 Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we%0a%3c will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.%0a%3c %0a%3c 19:33 And they made their father drink wine that night: and the%0a%3c firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when%0a%3c she lay down, nor when she arose.%0a%3c %0a%3c 19:34 And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto%0a%3c the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him%0a%3c drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we%0a%3c may preserve seed of our father.%0a%3c %0a%3c 19:35 And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the%0a%3c younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay%0a%3c down, nor when she arose.%0a%3c %0a%3c 19:36 Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father.%0a%3c %0a%3c 19:37 And the first born bare a son, and called his name Moab: the%0a%3c same is the father of the Moabites unto this day.%0a%3c %0a%3c 19:38 And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name%0a%3c Benammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this%0a%3c day.%0a%3c %0a%3c 20:1 And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country, and%0a%3c dwelled between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar.%0a%3c %0a%3c 20:2 And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister: and%0a%3c Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah.%0a%3c %0a%3c 20:3 But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him,%0a%3c Behold, thou art but a dead man, for the woman which thou hast taken;%0a%3c for she is a man's wife.%0a%3c %0a%3c 20:4 But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, LORD, wilt thou%0a%3c slay also a righteous nation?  20:5 Said he not unto me, She is my%0a%3c sister? and she, even she herself said, He is my brother: in the%0a%3c integrity of my heart and innocency of my hands have I done this.%0a%3c %0a%3c 20:6 And God said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst%0a%3c this in the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee from%0a%3c sinning against me: therefore suffered I thee not to touch her.%0a%3c %0a%3c 20:7 Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet, and%0a%3c he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore her%0a%3c not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that are%0a%3c thine.%0a%3c %0a%3c 20:8 Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his%0a%3c servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were%0a%3c sore afraid.%0a%3c %0a%3c 20:9 Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou%0a%3c done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on%0a%3c me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that%0a%3c ought not to be done.%0a%3c %0a%3c 20:10 And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou%0a%3c hast done this thing?  20:11 And Abraham said, Because I thought,%0a%3c Surely the fear of God is not in this place; and they will slay me for%0a%3c my wife's sake.%0a%3c %0a%3c 20:12 And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my%0a%3c father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.%0a%3c %0a%3c 20:13 And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my%0a%3c father's house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou%0a%3c shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me,%0a%3c He is my brother.%0a%3c %0a%3c 20:14 And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and%0a%3c womenservants, and gave them unto Abraham, and restored him Sarah his%0a%3c wife.%0a%3c %0a%3c 20:15 And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before thee: dwell where%0a%3c it pleaseth thee.%0a%3c %0a%3c 20:16 And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a%0a%3c thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a covering of the%0a%3c eyes, unto all that are with thee, and with all other: thus she was%0a%3c reproved.%0a%3c %0a%3c 20:17 So Abraham prayed unto God: and God healed Abimelech, and his%0a%3c wife, and his maidservants; and they bare children.%0a%3c %0a%3c 20:18 For the LORD had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of%0a%3c Abimelech, because of Sarah Abraham's wife.%0a%3c %0a%3c 21:1 And the LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did unto%0a%3c Sarah as he had spoken.%0a%3c %0a%3c 21:2 For Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at%0a%3c the set time of which God had spoken to him.%0a%3c %0a%3c 21:3 And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him,%0a%3c whom Sarah bare to him, Isaac.%0a%3c %0a%3c 21:4 And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being eight days old, as%0a%3c God had commanded him.%0a%3c %0a%3c 21:5 And Abraham was an hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born%0a%3c unto him.%0a%3c %0a%3c 21:6 And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh, so that all that hear%0a%3c will laugh with me.%0a%3c %0a%3c 21:7 And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah should%0a%3c have given children suck? for I have born him a son in his old age.%0a%3c %0a%3c 21:8 And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great%0a%3c feast the same day that Isaac was weaned.%0a%3c %0a%3c 21:9 And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had born%0a%3c unto Abraham, mocking.%0a%3c %0a%3c 21:10 Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her%0a%3c son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, even%0a%3c with Isaac.%0a%3c %0a%3c 21:11 And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight because of%0a%3c his son.%0a%3c %0a%3c 21:12 And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight%0a%3c because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah%0a%3c hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy%0a%3c seed be called.%0a%3c %0a%3c 21:13 And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation,%0a%3c because he is thy seed.%0a%3c %0a%3c 21:14 And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a%0a%3c bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder,%0a%3c and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in%0a%3c the wilderness of Beersheba.%0a%3c %0a%3c 21:15 And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child%0a%3c under one of the shrubs.%0a%3c %0a%3c 21:16 And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off,%0a%3c as it were a bow shot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the%0a%3c child. And she sat over against him, and lift up her voice, and wept.%0a%3c %0a%3c 21:17 And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called%0a%3c to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar?%0a%3c fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is.%0a%3c %0a%3c 21:18 Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I will%0a%3c make him a great nation.%0a%3c %0a%3c 21:19 And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she%0a%3c went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.%0a%3c %0a%3c 21:20 And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the%0a%3c wilderness, and became an archer.%0a%3c %0a%3c 21:21 And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him%0a%3c a wife out of the land of Egypt.%0a%3c %0a%3c 21:22 And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the%0a%3c chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God is with thee%0a%3c in all that thou doest: 21:23 Now therefore swear unto me here by God%0a%3c that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my%0a%3c son's son: but according to the kindness that I have done unto thee,%0a%3c thou shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned.%0a%3c %0a%3c 21:24 And Abraham said, I will swear.%0a%3c %0a%3c 21:25 And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water, which%0a%3c Abimelech's servants had violently taken away.%0a%3c %0a%3c 21:26 And Abimelech said, I wot not who hath done this thing; neither%0a%3c didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I of it, but to day.%0a%3c %0a%3c 21:27 And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech;%0a%3c and both of them made a covenant.%0a%3c %0a%3c 21:28 And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.%0a%3c %0a%3c 21:29 And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What mean these seven ewe lambs%0a%3c which thou hast set by themselves?  21:30 And he said, For these seven%0a%3c ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that they may be a witness unto%0a%3c me, that I have digged this well.%0a%3c %0a%3c 21:31 Wherefore he called that place Beersheba; because there they%0a%3c sware both of them.%0a%3c %0a%3c 21:32 Thus they made a covenant at Beersheba: then Abimelech rose up,%0a%3c and Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they returned into the%0a%3c land of the Philistines.%0a%3c %0a%3c 21:33 And Abraham planted a grove in Beersheba, and called there on%0a%3c the name of the LORD, the everlasting God.%0a%3c %0a%3c 21:34 And Abraham sojourned in the Philistines' land many days.%0a%3c %0a%3c 22:1 And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt%0a%3c Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am.%0a%3c %0a%3c 22:2 And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou%0a%3c lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for%0a%3c a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.%0a%3c %0a%3c 22:3 And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass,%0a%3c and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave%0a%3c the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place%0a%3c of which God had told him.%0a%3c %0a%3c 22:4 Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the%0a%3c place afar off.%0a%3c %0a%3c 22:5 And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass;%0a%3c and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you.%0a%3c %0a%3c 22:6 And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon%0a%3c Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they%0a%3c went both of them together.%0a%3c %0a%3c 22:7 And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and%0a%3c he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood:%0a%3c but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?  22:8 And Abraham said, My%0a%3c son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they%0a%3c went both of them together.%0a%3c %0a%3c 22:9 And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham%0a%3c built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his%0a%3c son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.%0a%3c %0a%3c 22:10 And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay%0a%3c his son.%0a%3c %0a%3c 22:11 And the angel of the LORD called unto him out of heaven, and%0a%3c said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I.%0a%3c %0a%3c 22:12 And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou%0a%3c any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou%0a%3c hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me.%0a%3c %0a%3c 22:13 And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind%0a%3c him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took%0a%3c the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his%0a%3c son.%0a%3c %0a%3c 22:14 And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovahjireh: as it is%0a%3c said to this day, In the mount of the LORD it shall be seen.%0a%3c %0a%3c 22:15 And the angel of the LORD called unto Abraham out of heaven the%0a%3c second time, 22:16 And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the LORD,%0a%3c for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son,%0a%3c thine only son: 22:17 That in blessing I will bless thee, and in%0a%3c multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and%0a%3c as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess%0a%3c the gate of his enemies; 22:18 And in thy seed shall all the nations%0a%3c of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice.%0a%3c %0a%3c 22:19 So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and%0a%3c went together to Beersheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beersheba.%0a%3c %0a%3c 22:20 And it came to pass after these things, that it was told%0a%3c Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children unto thy%0a%3c brother Nahor; 22:21 Huz his firstborn, and Buz his brother, and%0a%3c Kemuel the father of Aram, 22:22 And Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash,%0a%3c and Jidlaph, and Bethuel.%0a%3c %0a%3c 22:23 And Bethuel begat Rebekah: these eight Milcah did bear to Nahor,%0a%3c Abraham's brother.%0a%3c %0a%3c 22:24 And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bare also Tebah,%0a%3c and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah.%0a%3c %0a%3c 23:1 And Sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old: these%0a%3c were the years of the life of Sarah.%0a%3c %0a%3c 23:2 And Sarah died in Kirjatharba; the same is Hebron in the land of%0a%3c Canaan: and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her.%0a%3c %0a%3c 23:3 And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spake unto the%0a%3c sons of Heth, saying, 23:4 I am a stranger and a sojourner with you:%0a%3c give me a possession of a buryingplace with you, that I may bury my%0a%3c dead out of my sight.%0a%3c %0a%3c 23:5 And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him, 23:6%0a%3c Hear us, my lord: thou art a mighty prince among us: in the choice of%0a%3c our sepulchres bury thy dead; none of us shall withhold from thee his%0a%3c sepulchre, but that thou mayest bury thy dead.%0a%3c %0a%3c 23:7 And Abraham stood up, and bowed himself to the people of the%0a%3c land, even to the children of Heth.%0a%3c %0a%3c 23:8 And he communed with them, saying, If it be your mind that I%0a%3c should bury my dead out of my sight; hear me, and intreat for me to%0a%3c Ephron the son of Zohar, 23:9 That he may give me the cave of%0a%3c Machpelah, which he hath, which is in the end of his field; for as%0a%3c much money as it is worth he shall give it me for a possession of a%0a%3c buryingplace amongst you.%0a%3c %0a%3c 23:10 And Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth: and Ephron the%0a%3c Hittite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth, even%0a%3c of all that went in at the gate of his city, saying, 23:11 Nay, my%0a%3c lord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave that is therein, I%0a%3c give it thee; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it thee:%0a%3c bury thy dead.%0a%3c %0a%3c 23:12 And Abraham bowed down himself before the people of the land.%0a%3c %0a%3c 23:13 And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the%0a%3c land, saying, But if thou wilt give it, I pray thee, hear me: I will%0a%3c give thee money for the field; take it of me, and I will bury my dead%0a%3c there.%0a%3c %0a%3c 23:14 And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him, 23:15 My lord,%0a%3c hearken unto me: the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver;%0a%3c what is that betwixt me and thee? bury therefore thy dead.%0a%3c %0a%3c 23:16 And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron%0a%3c the silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth,%0a%3c four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant.%0a%3c %0a%3c 23:17 And the field of Ephron which was in Machpelah, which was before%0a%3c Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees%0a%3c that were in the field, that were in all the borders round about, were%0a%3c made sure 23:18 Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the%0a%3c children of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city.%0a%3c %0a%3c 23:19 And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the%0a%3c field of Machpelah before Mamre: the same is Hebron in the land of%0a%3c Canaan.%0a%3c %0a%3c 23:20 And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure unto%0a%3c Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of Heth.%0a%3c %0a%3c 24:1 And Abraham was old, and well stricken in age: and the LORD had%0a%3c blessed Abraham in all things.%0a%3c %0a%3c 24:2 And Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house, that ruled%0a%3c over all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh: 24:3%0a%3c And I will make thee swear by the LORD, the God of heaven, and the God%0a%3c of the earth, that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the%0a%3c daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell: 24:4 But thou shalt%0a%3c go unto my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son%0a%3c Isaac.%0a%3c %0a%3c 24:5 And the servant said unto him, Peradventure the woman will not be%0a%3c willing to follow me unto this land: must I needs bring thy son again%0a%3c unto the land from whence thou camest?  24:6 And Abraham said unto%0a%3c him, Beware thou that thou bring not my son thither again.%0a%3c %0a%3c 24:7 The LORD God of heaven, which took me from my father's house, and%0a%3c from the land of my kindred, and which spake unto me, and that sware%0a%3c unto me, saying, Unto thy seed will I give this land; he shall send%0a%3c his angel before thee, and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from%0a%3c thence.%0a%3c %0a%3c 24:8 And if the woman will not be willing to follow thee, then thou%0a%3c shalt be clear from this my oath: only bring not my son thither again.%0a%3c %0a%3c 24:9 And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his%0a%3c master, and sware to him concerning that matter.%0a%3c %0a%3c 24:10 And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master, and%0a%3c departed; for all the goods of his master were in his hand: and he%0a%3c arose, and went to Mesopotamia, unto the city of Nahor.%0a%3c %0a%3c 24:11 And he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well%0a%3c of water at the time of the evening, even the time that women go out%0a%3c to draw water.%0a%3c %0a%3c 24:12 And he said O LORD God of my master Abraham, I pray thee, send%0a%3c me good speed this day, and shew kindness unto my master Abraham.%0a%3c %0a%3c 24:13 Behold, I stand here by the well of water; and the daughters of%0a%3c the men of the city come out to draw water: 24:14 And let it come to%0a%3c pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I%0a%3c pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give%0a%3c thy camels drink also: let the same be she that thou hast appointed%0a%3c for thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed%0a%3c kindness unto my master.%0a%3c %0a%3c 24:15 And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that, behold,%0a%3c Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah, the wife of%0a%3c Nahor, Abraham's brother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder.%0a%3c %0a%3c 24:16 And the damsel was very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither had%0a%3c any man known her: and she went down to the well, and filled her%0a%3c pitcher, and came up.%0a%3c %0a%3c 24:17 And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let me, I pray thee,%0a%3c drink a little water of thy pitcher.%0a%3c %0a%3c 24:18 And she said, Drink, my lord: and she hasted, and let down her%0a%3c pitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink.%0a%3c %0a%3c 24:19 And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will draw%0a%3c water for thy camels also, until they have done drinking.%0a%3c %0a%3c 24:20 And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran%0a%3c again unto the well to draw water, and drew for all his camels.%0a%3c %0a%3c 24:21 And the man wondering at her held his peace, to wit whether the%0a%3c LORD had made his journey prosperous or not.%0a%3c %0a%3c 24:22 And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, that the%0a%3c man took a golden earring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets%0a%3c for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold; 24:23 And said, Whose%0a%3c daughter art thou? tell me, I pray thee: is there room in thy father's%0a%3c house for us to lodge in?  24:24 And she said unto him, I am the%0a%3c daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, which she bare unto Nahor.%0a%3c %0a%3c 24:25 She said moreover unto him, We have both straw and provender%0a%3c enough, and room to lodge in.%0a%3c %0a%3c 24:26 And the man bowed down his head, and worshipped the LORD.%0a%3c %0a%3c 24:27 And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of my master Abraham, who%0a%3c hath not left destitute my master of his mercy and his truth: I being%0a%3c in the way, the LORD led me to the house of my master's brethren.%0a%3c %0a%3c 24:28 And the damsel ran, and told them of her mother's house these%0a%3c things.%0a%3c %0a%3c 24:29 And Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban: and Laban ran%0a%3c out unto the man, unto the well.%0a%3c %0a%3c 24:30 And it came to pass, when he saw the earring and bracelets upon%0a%3c his sister's hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister,%0a%3c saying, Thus spake the man unto me; that he came unto the man; and,%0a%3c behold, he stood by the camels at the well.%0a%3c %0a%3c 24:31 And he said, Come in, thou blessed of the LORD; wherefore%0a%3c standest thou without? for I have prepared the house, and room for the%0a%3c camels.%0a%3c %0a%3c 24:32 And the man came into the house: and he ungirded his camels, and%0a%3c gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet,%0a%3c and the men's feet that were with him.%0a%3c %0a%3c 24:33 And there was set meat before him to eat: but he said, I will%0a%3c not eat, until I have told mine errand. And he said, Speak on.%0a%3c %0a%3c 24:34 And he said, I am Abraham's servant.%0a%3c %0a%3c 24:35 And the LORD hath blessed my master greatly; and he is become%0a%3c great: and he hath given him flocks, and herds, and silver, and gold,%0a%3c and menservants, and maidservants, and camels, and asses.%0a%3c %0a%3c 24:36 And Sarah my master's wife bare a son to my master when she was%0a%3c old: and unto him hath he given all that he hath.%0a%3c %0a%3c 24:37 And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife%0a%3c to my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell:%0a%3c 24:38 But thou shalt go unto my father's house, and to my kindred, and%0a%3c take a wife unto my son.%0a%3c %0a%3c 24:39 And I said unto my master, Peradventure the woman will not%0a%3c follow me.%0a%3c %0a%3c 24:40 And he said unto me, The LORD, before whom I walk, will send his%0a%3c angel with thee, and prosper thy way; and thou shalt take a wife for%0a%3c my son of my kindred, and of my father's house: 24:41 Then shalt thou%0a%3c be clear from this my oath, when thou comest to my kindred; and if%0a%3c they give not thee one, thou shalt be clear from my oath.%0a%3c %0a%3c 24:42 And I came this day unto the well, and said, O LORD God of my%0a%3c master Abraham, if now thou do prosper my way which I go: 24:43%0a%3c Behold, I stand by the well of water; and it shall come to pass, that%0a%3c when the virgin cometh forth to draw water, and I say to her, Give me,%0a%3c I pray thee, a little water of thy pitcher to drink; 24:44 And she say%0a%3c to me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy camels: let the%0a%3c same be the woman whom the LORD hath appointed out for my master's%0a%3c son.%0a%3c %0a%3c 24:45 And before I had done speaking in mine heart, behold, Rebekah%0a%3c came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down unto%0a%3c the well, and drew water: and I said unto her, Let me drink, I pray%0a%3c thee.%0a%3c %0a%3c 24:46 And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her shoulder,%0a%3c and said, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: so I drank,%0a%3c and she made the camels drink also.%0a%3c %0a%3c 24:47 And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter art thou? And she%0a%3c said, the daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bare unto him:%0a%3c and I put the earring upon her face, and the bracelets upon her hands.%0a%3c %0a%3c 24:48 And I bowed down my head, and worshipped the LORD, and blessed%0a%3c the LORD God of my master Abraham, which had led me in the right way%0a%3c to take my master's brother's daughter unto his son.%0a%3c %0a%3c 24:49 And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell%0a%3c me: and if not, tell me; that I may turn to the right hand, or to the%0a%3c left.%0a%3c %0a%3c 24:50 Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceedeth%0a%3c from the LORD: we cannot speak unto thee bad or good.%0a%3c %0a%3c 24:51 Behold, Rebekah is before thee, take her, and go, and let her be%0a%3c thy master's son's wife, as the LORD hath spoken.%0a%3c %0a%3c 24:52 And it came to pass, that, when Abraham's servant heard their%0a%3c words, he worshipped the LORD, bowing himself to the earth.%0a%3c %0a%3c 24:53 And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of%0a%3c gold, and raiment, and gave them to Rebekah: he gave also to her%0a%3c brother and to her mother precious things.%0a%3c %0a%3c 24:54 And they did eat and drink, he and the men that were with him,%0a%3c and tarried all night; and they rose up in the morning, and he said,%0a%3c Send me away unto my master.%0a%3c %0a%3c 24:55 And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with%0a%3c us a few days, at the least ten; after that she shall go.%0a%3c %0a%3c 24:56 And he said unto them, Hinder me not, seeing the LORD hath%0a%3c prospered my way; send me away that I may go to my master.%0a%3c %0a%3c 24:57 And they said, We will call the damsel, and enquire at her%0a%3c mouth.%0a%3c %0a%3c 24:58 And they called Rebekah, and said unto her, Wilt thou go with%0a%3c this man? And she said, I will go.%0a%3c %0a%3c 24:59 And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and%0a%3c Abraham's servant, and his men.%0a%3c %0a%3c 24:60 And they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her, Thou art our%0a%3c sister, be thou the mother of thousands of millions, and let thy seed%0a%3c possess the gate of those which hate them.%0a%3c %0a%3c 24:61 And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the%0a%3c camels, and followed the man: and the servant took Rebekah, and went%0a%3c his way.%0a%3c %0a%3c 24:62 And Isaac came from the way of the well Lahairoi; for he dwelt%0a%3c in the south country.%0a%3c %0a%3c 24:63 And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide: and%0a%3c he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, the camels were coming.%0a%3c %0a%3c 24:64 And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she%0a%3c lighted off the camel.%0a%3c %0a%3c 24:65 For she had said unto the servant, What man is this that walketh%0a%3c in the field to meet us? And the servant had said, It is my master:%0a%3c therefore she took a vail, and covered herself.%0a%3c %0a%3c 24:66 And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done.%0a%3c %0a%3c 24:67 And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent, and took%0a%3c Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her: and Isaac was%0a%3c comforted after his mother's death.%0a%3c %0a%3c 25:1 Then again Abraham took a wife, and her name was Keturah.%0a%3c %0a%3c 25:2 And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and%0a%3c Ishbak, and Shuah.%0a%3c %0a%3c 25:3 And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were%0a%3c Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim.%0a%3c %0a%3c 25:4 And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abidah,%0a%3c and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah.%0a%3c %0a%3c 25:5 And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac.%0a%3c %0a%3c 25:6 But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham%0a%3c gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived,%0a%3c eastward, unto the east country.%0a%3c %0a%3c 25:7 And these are the days of the years of Abraham's life which he%0a%3c lived, an hundred threescore and fifteen years.%0a%3c %0a%3c 25:8 Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an%0a%3c old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people.%0a%3c %0a%3c 25:9 And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of%0a%3c Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which%0a%3c is before Mamre; 25:10 The field which Abraham purchased of the sons%0a%3c of Heth: there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife.%0a%3c %0a%3c 25:11 And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed%0a%3c his son Isaac; and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahairoi.%0a%3c %0a%3c 25:12 Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom%0a%3c Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bare unto Abraham: 25:13 And%0a%3c these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according%0a%3c to their generations: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebajoth; and Kedar,%0a%3c and Adbeel, and Mibsam, 25:14 And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa, 25:15%0a%3c Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah: 25:16 These are the sons%0a%3c of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their towns, and by their%0a%3c castles; twelve princes according to their nations.%0a%3c %0a%3c 25:17 And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and%0a%3c thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was%0a%3c gathered unto his people.%0a%3c %0a%3c 25:18 And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that is before Egypt, as%0a%3c thou goest toward Assyria: and he died in the presence of all his%0a%3c brethren.%0a%3c %0a%3c 25:19 And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son: Abraham%0a%3c begat Isaac: 25:20 And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah%0a%3c to wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padanaram, the sister%0a%3c to Laban the Syrian.%0a%3c %0a%3c 25:21 And Isaac intreated the LORD for his wife, because she was%0a%3c barren: and the LORD was intreated of him, and Rebekah his wife%0a%3c conceived.%0a%3c %0a%3c 25:22 And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If%0a%3c it be so, why am I thus? And she went to enquire of the LORD.%0a%3c %0a%3c 25:23 And the LORD said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, and two%0a%3c manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels; and the one%0a%3c people shall be stronger than the other people; and the elder shall%0a%3c serve the younger.%0a%3c %0a%3c 25:24 And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there%0a%3c were twins in her womb.%0a%3c %0a%3c 25:25 And the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment; and%0a%3c they called his name Esau.%0a%3c %0a%3c 25:26 And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on%0a%3c Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was threescore%0a%3c years old when she bare them.%0a%3c %0a%3c 25:27 And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the%0a%3c field; and Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in tents.%0a%3c %0a%3c 25:28 And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison: but%0a%3c Rebekah loved Jacob.%0a%3c %0a%3c 25:29 And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he was%0a%3c faint: 25:30 And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that%0a%3c same red pottage; for I am faint: therefore was his name called Edom.%0a%3c %0a%3c 25:31 And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright.%0a%3c %0a%3c 25:32 And Esau said, Behold, I am at the point to die: and what profit%0a%3c shall this birthright do to me?  25:33 And Jacob said, Swear to me%0a%3c this day; and he sware unto him: and he sold his birthright unto%0a%3c Jacob.%0a%3c %0a%3c 25:34 Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did%0a%3c eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised his%0a%3c birthright.%0a%3c %0a%3c 26:1 And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine that%0a%3c was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the%0a%3c Philistines unto Gerar.%0a%3c %0a%3c 26:2 And the LORD appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into Egypt;%0a%3c dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of: 26:3 Sojourn in this%0a%3c land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee; for unto thee, and%0a%3c unto thy seed, I will give all these countries, and I will perform the%0a%3c oath which I sware unto Abraham thy father; 26:4 And I will make thy%0a%3c seed to multiply as the stars of heaven, and will give unto thy seed%0a%3c all these countries; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the%0a%3c earth be blessed; 26:5 Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept%0a%3c my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.%0a%3c %0a%3c 26:6 And Isaac dwelt in Gerar: 26:7 And the men of the place asked him%0a%3c of his wife; and he said, She is my sister: for he feared to say, She%0a%3c is my wife; lest, said he, the men of the place should kill me for%0a%3c Rebekah; because she was fair to look upon.%0a%3c %0a%3c 26:8 And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that%0a%3c Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw,%0a%3c and, behold, Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife.%0a%3c %0a%3c 26:9 And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, of a surety she is%0a%3c thy wife; and how saidst thou, She is my sister? And Isaac said unto%0a%3c him, Because I said, Lest I die for her.%0a%3c %0a%3c 26:10 And Abimelech said, What is this thou hast done unto us? one of%0a%3c the people might lightly have lien with thy wife, and thou shouldest%0a%3c have brought guiltiness upon us.%0a%3c %0a%3c 26:11 And Abimelech charged all his people, saying, He that toucheth%0a%3c this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.%0a%3c %0a%3c 26:12 Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year an%0a%3c hundredfold: and the LORD blessed him.%0a%3c %0a%3c 26:13 And the man waxed great, and went forward, and grew until he%0a%3c became very great: 26:14 For he had possession of flocks, and%0a%3c possession of herds, and great store of servants: and the Philistines%0a%3c envied him.%0a%3c %0a%3c 26:15 For all the wells which his father's servants had digged in the%0a%3c days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped them, and%0a%3c filled them with earth.%0a%3c %0a%3c 26:16 And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us; for thou art much%0a%3c mightier than we.%0a%3c %0a%3c 26:17 And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the valley of%0a%3c Gerar, and dwelt there.%0a%3c %0a%3c 26:18 And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had digged%0a%3c in the days of Abraham his father; for the Philistines had stopped%0a%3c them after the death of Abraham: and he called their names after the%0a%3c names by which his father had called them.%0a%3c %0a%3c 26:19 And Isaac's servants digged in the valley, and found there a%0a%3c well of springing water.%0a%3c %0a%3c 26:20 And the herdmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac's herdmen,%0a%3c saying, The water is ours: and he called the name of the well Esek;%0a%3c because they strove with him.%0a%3c %0a%3c 26:21 And they digged another well, and strove for that also: and he%0a%3c called the name of it Sitnah.%0a%3c %0a%3c 26:22 And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for%0a%3c that they strove not: and he called the name of it Rehoboth; and he%0a%3c said, For now the LORD hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitful%0a%3c in the land.%0a%3c %0a%3c 26:23 And he went up from thence to Beersheba.%0a%3c %0a%3c 26:24 And the LORD appeared unto him the same night, and said, I am%0a%3c the God of Abraham thy father: fear not, for I am with thee, and will%0a%3c bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham's sake.%0a%3c %0a%3c 26:25 And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name of the%0a%3c LORD, and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac's servants digged a%0a%3c well.%0a%3c %0a%3c 26:26 Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his%0a%3c friends, and Phichol the chief captain of his army.%0a%3c %0a%3c 26:27 And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore come ye to me, seeing ye%0a%3c hate me, and have sent me away from you?  26:28 And they said, We saw%0a%3c certainly that the LORD was with thee: and we said, Let there be now%0a%3c an oath betwixt us, even betwixt us and thee, and let us make a%0a%3c covenant with thee; 26:29 That thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not%0a%3c touched thee, and as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have%0a%3c sent thee away in peace: thou art now the blessed of the LORD.%0a%3c %0a%3c 26:30 And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink.%0a%3c %0a%3c 26:31 And they rose up betimes in the morning, and sware one to%0a%3c another: and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in%0a%3c peace.%0a%3c %0a%3c 26:32 And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac's servants came,%0a%3c and told him concerning the well which they had digged, and said unto%0a%3c him, We have found water.%0a%3c %0a%3c 26:33 And he called it Shebah: therefore the name of the city is%0a%3c Beersheba unto this day.%0a%3c %0a%3c 26:34 And Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith the%0a%3c daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of Elon the%0a%3c Hittite: 26:35 Which were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah.%0a%3c %0a%3c 27:1 And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were%0a%3c dim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his eldest son, and said%0a%3c unto him, My son: and he said unto him, Behold, here am I.%0a%3c %0a%3c 27:2 And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my%0a%3c death: 27:3 Now therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver%0a%3c and thy bow, and go out to the field, and take me some venison; 27:4%0a%3c And make me savoury meat, such as I love, and bring it to me, that I%0a%3c may eat; that my soul may bless thee before I die.%0a%3c %0a%3c 27:5 And Rebekah heard when Isaac spake to Esau his son. And Esau went%0a%3c to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it.%0a%3c %0a%3c 27:6 And Rebekah spake unto Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard thy%0a%3c father speak unto Esau thy brother, saying, 27:7 Bring me venison, and%0a%3c make me savoury meat, that I may eat, and bless thee before the LORD%0a%3c before my death.%0a%3c %0a%3c 27:8 Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I%0a%3c command thee.%0a%3c %0a%3c 27:9 Go now to the flock, and fetch me from thence two good kids of%0a%3c the goats; and I will make them savoury meat for thy father, such as%0a%3c he loveth: 27:10 And thou shalt bring it to thy father, that he may%0a%3c eat, and that he may bless thee before his death.%0a%3c %0a%3c 27:11 And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother is%0a%3c a hairy man, and I am a smooth man: 27:12 My father peradventure will%0a%3c feel me, and I shall seem to him as a deceiver; and I shall bring a%0a%3c curse upon me, and not a blessing.%0a%3c %0a%3c 27:13 And his mother said unto him, Upon me be thy curse, my son: only%0a%3c obey my voice, and go fetch me them.%0a%3c %0a%3c 27:14 And he went, and fetched, and brought them to his mother: and%0a%3c his mother made savoury meat, such as his father loved.%0a%3c %0a%3c 27:15 And Rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son Esau, which%0a%3c were with her in the house, and put them upon Jacob her younger son:%0a%3c 27:16 And she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands,%0a%3c and upon the smooth of his neck: 27:17 And she gave the savoury meat%0a%3c and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.%0a%3c %0a%3c 27:18 And he came unto his father, and said, My father: and he said,%0a%3c Here am I; who art thou, my son?  27:19 And Jacob said unto his%0a%3c father, I am Esau thy first born; I have done according as thou badest%0a%3c me: arise, I pray thee, sit and eat of my venison, that thy soul may%0a%3c bless me.%0a%3c %0a%3c 27:20 And Isaac said unto his son, How is it that thou hast found it%0a%3c so quickly, my son? And he said, Because the LORD thy God brought it%0a%3c to me.%0a%3c %0a%3c 27:21 And Isaac said unto Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I may%0a%3c feel thee, my son, whether thou be my very son Esau or not.%0a%3c %0a%3c 27:22 And Jacob went near unto Isaac his father; and he felt him, and%0a%3c said, The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.%0a%3c %0a%3c 27:23 And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his%0a%3c brother Esau's hands: so he blessed him.%0a%3c %0a%3c 27:24 And he said, Art thou my very son Esau? And he said, I am.%0a%3c %0a%3c 27:25 And he said, Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son's%0a%3c venison, that my soul may bless thee. And he brought it near to him,%0a%3c and he did eat: and he brought him wine and he drank.%0a%3c %0a%3c 27:26 And his father Isaac said unto him, Come near now, and kiss me,%0a%3c my son.%0a%3c %0a%3c 27:27 And he came near, and kissed him: and he smelled the smell of%0a%3c his raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my son is as%0a%3c the smell of a field which the LORD hath blessed: 27:28 Therefore God%0a%3c give thee of the dew of heaven, and the fatness of the earth, and%0a%3c plenty of corn and wine: 27:29 Let people serve thee, and nations bow%0a%3c down to thee: be lord over thy brethren, and let thy mother's sons bow%0a%3c down to thee: cursed be every one that curseth thee, and blessed be he%0a%3c that blesseth thee.%0a%3c %0a%3c 27:30 And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of%0a%3c blessing Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of%0a%3c Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting.%0a%3c %0a%3c 27:31 And he also had made savoury meat, and brought it unto his%0a%3c father, and said unto his father, Let my father arise, and eat of his%0a%3c son's venison, that thy soul may bless me.%0a%3c %0a%3c 27:32 And Isaac his father said unto him, Who art thou? And he said, I%0a%3c am thy son, thy firstborn Esau.%0a%3c %0a%3c 27:33 And Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who? where is he%0a%3c that hath taken venison, and brought it me, and I have eaten of all%0a%3c before thou camest, and have blessed him? yea, and he shall be%0a%3c blessed.%0a%3c %0a%3c 27:34 And when Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with a%0a%3c great and exceeding bitter cry, and said unto his father, Bless me,%0a%3c even me also, O my father.%0a%3c %0a%3c 27:35 And he said, Thy brother came with subtilty, and hath taken away%0a%3c thy blessing.%0a%3c %0a%3c 27:36 And he said, Is not he rightly named Jacob? for he hath%0a%3c supplanted me these two times: he took away my birthright; and,%0a%3c behold, now he hath taken away my blessing. And he said, Hast thou not%0a%3c reserved a blessing for me?  27:37 And Isaac answered and said unto%0a%3c Esau, Behold, I have made him thy lord, and all his brethren have I%0a%3c given to him for servants; and with corn and wine have I sustained%0a%3c him: and what shall I do now unto thee, my son?  27:38 And Esau said%0a%3c unto his father, Hast thou but one blessing, my father? bless me, even%0a%3c me also, O my father. And Esau lifted up his voice, and wept.%0a%3c %0a%3c 27:39 And Isaac his father answered and said unto him, Behold, thy%0a%3c dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of heaven%0a%3c from above; 27:40 And by thy sword shalt thou live, and shalt serve%0a%3c thy brother; and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the%0a%3c dominion, that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck.%0a%3c %0a%3c 27:41 And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith his%0a%3c father blessed him: and Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning%0a%3c for my father are at hand; then will I slay my brother Jacob.%0a%3c %0a%3c 27:42 And these words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah: and%0a%3c she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said unto him, Behold,%0a%3c thy brother Esau, as touching thee, doth comfort himself, purposing to%0a%3c kill thee.%0a%3c %0a%3c 27:43 Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; arise, flee thou to Laban%0a%3c my brother to Haran; 27:44 And tarry with him a few days, until thy%0a%3c brother's fury turn away; 27:45 Until thy brother's anger turn away%0a%3c from thee, and he forget that which thou hast done to him: then I will%0a%3c send, and fetch thee from thence: why should I be deprived also of you%0a%3c both in one day?  27:46 And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my%0a%3c life because of the daughters of Heth: if Jacob take a wife of the%0a%3c daughters of Heth, such as these which are of the daughters of the%0a%3c land, what good shall my life do me?  28:1 And Isaac called Jacob, and%0a%3c blessed him, and charged him, and said unto him, Thou shalt not take a%0a%3c wife of the daughters of Canaan.%0a%3c %0a%3c 28:2 Arise, go to Padanaram, to the house of Bethuel thy mother's%0a%3c father; and take thee a wife from thence of the daughers of Laban thy%0a%3c mother's brother.%0a%3c %0a%3c 28:3 And God Almighty bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and multiply%0a%3c thee, that thou mayest be a multitude of people; 28:4 And give thee%0a%3c the blessing of Abraham, to thee, and to thy seed with thee; that thou%0a%3c mayest inherit the land wherein thou art a stranger, which God gave%0a%3c unto Abraham.%0a%3c %0a%3c 28:5 And Isaac sent away Jacob: and he went to Padanaram unto Laban,%0a%3c son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob's and Esau's%0a%3c mother.%0a%3c %0a%3c 28:6 When Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob, and sent him away to%0a%3c Padanaram, to take him a wife from thence; and that as he blessed him%0a%3c he gave him a charge, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife of the%0a%3c daughers of Canaan; 28:7 And that Jacob obeyed his father and his%0a%3c mother, and was gone to Padanaram; 28:8 And Esau seeing that the%0a%3c daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac his father; 28:9 Then went Esau%0a%3c unto Ishmael, and took unto the wives which he had Mahalath the%0a%3c daughter of Ishmael Abraham's son, the sister of Nebajoth, to be his%0a%3c wife.%0a%3c %0a%3c 28:10 And Jacob went out from Beersheba, and went toward Haran.%0a%3c %0a%3c 28:11 And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all%0a%3c night, because the sun was set; and he took of the stones of that%0a%3c place, and put them for his pillows, and lay down in that place to%0a%3c sleep.%0a%3c %0a%3c 28:12 And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the%0a%3c top of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God ascending%0a%3c and descending on it.%0a%3c %0a%3c 28:13 And, behold, the LORD stood above it, and said, I am the LORD%0a%3c God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac: the land whereon thou%0a%3c liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed; 28:14 And thy seed%0a%3c shall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt spread abroad to the%0a%3c west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south: and in thee%0a%3c and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.%0a%3c %0a%3c 28:15 And, behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places%0a%3c whither thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land; for I%0a%3c will not leave thee, until I have done that which I have spoken to%0a%3c thee of.%0a%3c %0a%3c 28:16 And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the LORD%0a%3c is in this place; and I knew it not.%0a%3c %0a%3c 28:17 And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place! this is%0a%3c none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.%0a%3c %0a%3c 28:18 And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that%0a%3c he had put for his pillows, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil%0a%3c upon the top of it.%0a%3c %0a%3c 28:19 And he called the name of that place Bethel: but the name of%0a%3c that city was called Luz at the first.%0a%3c %0a%3c 28:20 And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will%0a%3c keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and%0a%3c raiment to put on, 28:21 So that I come again to my father's house in%0a%3c peace; then shall the LORD be my God: 28:22 And this stone, which I%0a%3c have set for a pillar, shall be God's house: and of all that thou%0a%3c shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee.%0a%3c %0a%3c 29:1 Then Jacob went on his journey, and came into the land of the%0a%3c people of the east.%0a%3c %0a%3c 29:2 And he looked, and behold a well in the field, and, lo, there%0a%3c were three flocks of sheep lying by it; for out of that well they%0a%3c watered the flocks: and a great stone was upon the well's mouth.%0a%3c %0a%3c 29:3 And thither were all the flocks gathered: and they rolled the%0a%3c stone from the well's mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone%0a%3c again upon the well's mouth in his place.%0a%3c %0a%3c 29:4 And Jacob said unto them, My brethren, whence be ye? And they%0a%3c said, Of Haran are we.%0a%3c %0a%3c 29:5 And he said unto them, Know ye Laban the son of Nahor? And they%0a%3c said, We know him.%0a%3c %0a%3c 29:6 And he said unto them, Is he well? And they said, He is well:%0a%3c and, behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep.%0a%3c %0a%3c 29:7 And he said, Lo, it is yet high day, neither is it time that the%0a%3c cattle should be gathered together: water ye the sheep, and go and%0a%3c feed them.%0a%3c %0a%3c 29:8 And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered%0a%3c together, and till they roll the stone from the well's mouth; then we%0a%3c water the sheep.%0a%3c %0a%3c 29:9 And while he yet spake with them, Rachel came with her father's%0a%3c sheep; for she kept them.%0a%3c %0a%3c 29:10 And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban%0a%3c his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother's brother,%0a%3c that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and%0a%3c watered the flock of Laban his mother's brother.%0a%3c %0a%3c 29:11 And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept.%0a%3c %0a%3c 29:12 And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's brother, and that%0a%3c he was Rebekah's son: and she ran and told her father.%0a%3c %0a%3c 29:13 And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his%0a%3c sister's son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed%0a%3c him, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban all these things.%0a%3c %0a%3c 29:14 And Laban said to him, Surely thou art my bone and my flesh. And%0a%3c he abode with him the space of a month.%0a%3c %0a%3c 29:15 And Laban said unto Jacob, Because thou art my brother,%0a%3c shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought? tell me, what shall thy%0a%3c wages be?  29:16 And Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder%0a%3c was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.%0a%3c %0a%3c 29:17 Leah was tender eyed; but Rachel was beautiful and well%0a%3c favoured.%0a%3c %0a%3c 29:18 And Jacob loved Rachel; and said, I will serve thee seven years%0a%3c for Rachel thy younger daughter.%0a%3c %0a%3c 29:19 And Laban said, It is better that I give her to thee, than that%0a%3c I should give her to another man: abide with me.%0a%3c %0a%3c 29:20 And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed unto%0a%3c him but a few days, for the love he had to her.%0a%3c %0a%3c 29:21 And Jacob said unto Laban, Give me my wife, for my days are%0a%3c fulfilled, that I may go in unto her.%0a%3c %0a%3c 29:22 And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a%0a%3c feast.%0a%3c %0a%3c 29:23 And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his%0a%3c daughter, and brought her to him; and he went in unto her.%0a%3c %0a%3c 29:24 And Laban gave unto his daughter Leah Zilpah his maid for an%0a%3c handmaid.%0a%3c %0a%3c 29:25 And it came to pass, that in the morning, behold, it was Leah:%0a%3c and he said to Laban, What is this thou hast done unto me? did not I%0a%3c serve with thee for Rachel? wherefore then hast thou beguiled me?%0a%3c 29:26 And Laban said, It must not be so done in our country, to give%0a%3c the younger before the firstborn.%0a%3c %0a%3c 29:27 Fulfil her week, and we will give thee this also for the service%0a%3c which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years.%0a%3c %0a%3c 29:28 And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week: and he gave him Rachel%0a%3c his daughter to wife also.%0a%3c %0a%3c 29:29 And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be%0a%3c her maid.%0a%3c %0a%3c 29:30 And he went in also unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more%0a%3c than Leah, and served with him yet seven other years.%0a%3c %0a%3c 29:31 And when the LORD saw that Leah was hated, he opened her womb:%0a%3c but Rachel was barren.%0a%3c %0a%3c 29:32 And Leah conceived, and bare a son, and she called his name%0a%3c Reuben: for she said, Surely the LORD hath looked upon my affliction;%0a%3c now therefore my husband will love me.%0a%3c %0a%3c 29:33 And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Because the%0a%3c LORD hath heard I was hated, he hath therefore given me this son also:%0a%3c and she called his name Simeon.%0a%3c %0a%3c 29:34 And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Now this time%0a%3c will my husband be joined unto me, because I have born him three sons:%0a%3c therefore was his name called Levi.%0a%3c %0a%3c 29:35 And she conceived again, and bare a son: and she said, Now will%0a%3c I praise the LORD: therefore she called his name Judah; and left%0a%3c bearing.%0a%3c %0a%3c 30:1 And when Rachel saw that she bare Jacob no children, Rachel%0a%3c envied her sister; and said unto Jacob, Give me children, or else I%0a%3c die.%0a%3c %0a%3c 30:2 And Jacob's anger was kindled against Rachel: and he said, Am I%0a%3c in God's stead, who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb?%0a%3c 30:3 And she said, Behold my maid Bilhah, go in unto her; and she%0a%3c shall bear upon my knees, that I may also have children by her.%0a%3c %0a%3c 30:4 And she gave him Bilhah her handmaid to wife: and Jacob went in%0a%3c unto her.%0a%3c %0a%3c 30:5 And Bilhah conceived, and bare Jacob a son.%0a%3c %0a%3c 30:6 And Rachel said, God hath judged me, and hath also heard my%0a%3c voice, and hath given me a son: therefore called she his name Dan.%0a%3c %0a%3c 30:7 And Bilhah Rachel's maid conceived again, and bare Jacob a second%0a%3c son.%0a%3c %0a%3c 30:8 And Rachel said, With great wrestlings have I wrestled with my%0a%3c sister, and I have prevailed: and she called his name Naphtali.%0a%3c %0a%3c 30:9 When Leah saw that she had left bearing, she took Zilpah her%0a%3c maid, and gave her Jacob to wife.%0a%3c %0a%3c 30:10 And Zilpah Leah's maid bare Jacob a son.%0a%3c %0a%3c 30:11 And Leah said, A troop cometh: and she called his name Gad.%0a%3c %0a%3c 30:12 And Zilpah Leah's maid bare Jacob a second son.%0a%3c %0a%3c 30:13 And Leah said, Happy am I, for the daughters will call me%0a%3c blessed: and she called his name Asher.%0a%3c %0a%3c 30:14 And Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found%0a%3c mandrakes in the field, and brought them unto his mother Leah. Then%0a%3c Rachel said to Leah, Give me, I pray thee, of thy son's mandrakes.%0a%3c %0a%3c 30:15 And she said unto her, Is it a small matter that thou hast taken%0a%3c my husband? and wouldest thou take away my son's mandrakes also? And%0a%3c Rachel said, Therefore he shall lie with thee to night for thy son's%0a%3c mandrakes.%0a%3c %0a%3c 30:16 And Jacob came out of the field in the evening, and Leah went%0a%3c out to meet him, and said, Thou must come in unto me; for surely I%0a%3c have hired thee with my son's mandrakes. And he lay with her that%0a%3c night.%0a%3c %0a%3c 30:17 And God hearkened unto Leah, and she conceived, and bare Jacob%0a%3c the fifth son.%0a%3c %0a%3c 30:18 And Leah said, God hath given me my hire, because I have given%0a%3c my maiden to my husband: and she called his name Issachar.%0a%3c %0a%3c 30:19 And Leah conceived again, and bare Jacob the sixth son.%0a%3c %0a%3c 30:20 And Leah said, God hath endued me with a good dowry; now will my%0a%3c husband dwell with me, because I have born him six sons: and she%0a%3c called his name Zebulun.%0a%3c %0a%3c 30:21 And afterwards she bare a daughter, and called her name Dinah.%0a%3c %0a%3c 30:22 And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, and opened%0a%3c her womb.%0a%3c %0a%3c 30:23 And she conceived, and bare a son; and said, God hath taken away%0a%3c my reproach: 30:24 And she called his name Joseph; and said, The LORD%0a%3c shall add to me another son.%0a%3c %0a%3c 30:25 And it came to pass, when Rachel had born Joseph, that Jacob%0a%3c said unto Laban, Send me away, that I may go unto mine own place, and%0a%3c to my country.%0a%3c %0a%3c 30:26 Give me my wives and my children, for whom I have served thee,%0a%3c and let me go: for thou knowest my service which I have done thee.%0a%3c %0a%3c 30:27 And Laban said unto him, I pray thee, if I have found favour in%0a%3c thine eyes, tarry: for I have learned by experience that the LORD hath%0a%3c blessed me for thy sake.%0a%3c %0a%3c 30:28 And he said, Appoint me thy wages, and I will give it.%0a%3c %0a%3c 30:29 And he said unto him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and%0a%3c how thy cattle was with me.%0a%3c %0a%3c 30:30 For it was little which thou hadst before I came, and it is now%0a%3c increased unto a multitude; and the LORD hath blessed thee since my%0a%3c coming: and now when shall I provide for mine own house also?  30:31%0a%3c And he said, What shall I give thee? And Jacob said, Thou shalt not%0a%3c give me any thing: if thou wilt do this thing for me, I will again%0a%3c feed and keep thy flock.%0a%3c %0a%3c 30:32 I will pass through all thy flock to day, removing from thence%0a%3c all the speckled and spotted cattle, and all the brown cattle among%0a%3c the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats: and of such%0a%3c shall be my hire.%0a%3c %0a%3c 30:33 So shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come, when it%0a%3c shall come for my hire before thy face: every one that is not speckled%0a%3c and spotted among the goats, and brown among the sheep, that shall be%0a%3c counted stolen with me.%0a%3c %0a%3c 30:34 And Laban said, Behold, I would it might be according to thy%0a%3c word.%0a%3c %0a%3c 30:35 And he removed that day the he goats that were ringstraked and%0a%3c spotted, and all the she goats that were speckled and spotted, and%0a%3c every one that had some white in it, and all the brown among the%0a%3c sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons.%0a%3c %0a%3c 30:36 And he set three days' journey betwixt himself and Jacob: and%0a%3c Jacob fed the rest of Laban's flocks.%0a%3c %0a%3c 30:37 And Jacob took him rods of green poplar, and of the hazel and%0a%3c chesnut tree; and pilled white strakes in them, and made the white%0a%3c appear which was in the rods.%0a%3c %0a%3c 30:38 And he set the rods which he had pilled before the flocks in the%0a%3c gutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to drink, that%0a%3c they should conceive when they came to drink.%0a%3c %0a%3c 30:39 And the flocks conceived before the rods, and brought forth%0a%3c cattle ringstraked, speckled, and spotted.%0a%3c %0a%3c 30:40 And Jacob did separate the lambs, and set the faces of the%0a%3c flocks toward the ringstraked, and all the brown in the flock of%0a%3c Laban; and he put his own flocks by themselves, and put them not unto%0a%3c Laban's cattle.%0a%3c %0a%3c 30:41 And it came to pass, whensoever the stronger cattle did%0a%3c conceive, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle in%0a%3c the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods.%0a%3c %0a%3c 30:42 But when the cattle were feeble, he put them not in: so the%0a%3c feebler were Laban's, and the stronger Jacob's.%0a%3c %0a%3c 30:43 And the man increased exceedingly, and had much cattle, and%0a%3c maidservants, and menservants, and camels, and asses.%0a%3c %0a%3c 31:1 And he heard the words of Laban's sons, saying, Jacob hath taken%0a%3c away all that was our father's; and of that which was our father's%0a%3c hath he gotten all this glory.%0a%3c %0a%3c 31:2 And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it was%0a%3c not toward him as before.%0a%3c %0a%3c 31:3 And the LORD said unto Jacob, Return unto the land of thy%0a%3c fathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee.%0a%3c %0a%3c 31:4 And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto his%0a%3c flock, 31:5 And said unto them, I see your father's countenance, that%0a%3c it is not toward me as before; but the God of my father hath been with%0a%3c me.%0a%3c %0a%3c 31:6 And ye know that with all my power I have served your father.%0a%3c %0a%3c 31:7 And your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten times;%0a%3c but God suffered him not to hurt me.%0a%3c %0a%3c 31:8 If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages; then all the%0a%3c cattle bare speckled: and if he said thus, The ringstraked shall be%0a%3c thy hire; then bare all the cattle ringstraked.%0a%3c %0a%3c 31:9 Thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father, and given%0a%3c them to me.%0a%3c %0a%3c 31:10 And it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived, that%0a%3c I lifted up mine eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold, the rams which%0a%3c leaped upon the cattle were ringstraked, speckled, and grisled.%0a%3c %0a%3c 31:11 And the angel of God spake unto me in a dream, saying, Jacob:%0a%3c And I said, Here am I.%0a%3c %0a%3c 31:12 And he said, Lift up now thine eyes, and see, all the rams which%0a%3c leap upon the cattle are ringstraked, speckled, and grisled: for I%0a%3c have seen all that Laban doeth unto thee.%0a%3c %0a%3c 31:13 I am the God of Bethel, where thou anointedst the pillar, and%0a%3c where thou vowedst a vow unto me: now arise, get thee out from this%0a%3c land, and return unto the land of thy kindred.%0a%3c %0a%3c 31:14 And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him, Is there yet any%0a%3c portion or inheritance for us in our father's house?  31:15 Are we not%0a%3c counted of him strangers? for he hath sold us, and hath quite devoured%0a%3c also our money.%0a%3c %0a%3c 31:16 For all the riches which God hath taken from our father, that is%0a%3c ours, and our children's: now then, whatsoever God hath said unto%0a%3c thee, do.%0a%3c %0a%3c 31:17 Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon camels;%0a%3c 31:18 And he carried away all his cattle, and all his goods which he%0a%3c had gotten, the cattle of his getting, which he had gotten in%0a%3c Padanaram, for to go to Isaac his father in the land of Canaan.%0a%3c %0a%3c 31:19 And Laban went to shear his sheep: and Rachel had stolen the%0a%3c images that were her father's.%0a%3c %0a%3c 31:20 And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he%0a%3c told him not that he fled.%0a%3c %0a%3c 31:21 So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed over%0a%3c the river, and set his face toward the mount Gilead.%0a%3c %0a%3c 31:22 And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled.%0a%3c %0a%3c 31:23 And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven%0a%3c days' journey; and they overtook him in the mount Gilead.%0a%3c %0a%3c 31:24 And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night, and said%0a%3c unto him, Take heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.%0a%3c %0a%3c 31:25 Then Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the%0a%3c mount: and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mount of Gilead.%0a%3c %0a%3c 31:26 And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast%0a%3c stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters, as captives%0a%3c taken with the sword?  31:27 Wherefore didst thou flee away secretly,%0a%3c and steal away from me; and didst not tell me, that I might have sent%0a%3c thee away with mirth, and with songs, with tabret, and with harp?%0a%3c 31:28 And hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters? thou%0a%3c hast now done foolishly in so doing.%0a%3c %0a%3c 31:29 It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of%0a%3c your father spake unto me yesternight, saying, Take thou heed that%0a%3c thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.%0a%3c %0a%3c 31:30 And now, though thou wouldest needs be gone, because thou sore%0a%3c longedst after thy father's house, yet wherefore hast thou stolen my%0a%3c gods?  31:31 And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was%0a%3c afraid: for I said, Peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy%0a%3c daughters from me.%0a%3c %0a%3c 31:32 With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, let him not live: before%0a%3c our brethren discern thou what is thine with me, and take it to thee.%0a%3c For Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them.%0a%3c %0a%3c 31:33 And Laban went into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and into%0a%3c the two maidservants' tents; but he found them not. Then went he out%0a%3c of Leah's tent, and entered into Rachel's tent.%0a%3c %0a%3c 31:34 Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camel's%0a%3c furniture, and sat upon them. And Laban searched all the tent, but%0a%3c found them not.%0a%3c %0a%3c 31:35 And she said to her father, Let it not displease my lord that I%0a%3c cannot rise up before thee; for the custom of women is upon me. And he%0a%3c searched but found not the images.%0a%3c %0a%3c 31:36 And Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban: and Jacob answered%0a%3c and said to Laban, What is my trespass? what is my sin, that thou hast%0a%3c so hotly pursued after me?  31:37 Whereas thou hast searched all my%0a%3c stuff, what hast thou found of all thy household stuff? set it here%0a%3c before my brethren and thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt us%0a%3c both.%0a%3c %0a%3c 31:38 This twenty years have I been with thee; thy ewes and thy she%0a%3c goats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flock have I not%0a%3c eaten.%0a%3c %0a%3c 31:39 That which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee; I bare%0a%3c the loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it, whether stolen by%0a%3c day, or stolen by night.%0a%3c %0a%3c 31:40 Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by%0a%3c night; and my sleep departed from mine eyes.%0a%3c %0a%3c 31:41 Thus have I been twenty years in thy house; I served thee%0a%3c fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy cattle:%0a%3c and thou hast changed my wages ten times.%0a%3c %0a%3c 31:42 Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of%0a%3c Isaac, had been with me, surely thou hadst sent me away now empty. God%0a%3c hath seen mine affliction and the labour of my hands, and rebuked thee%0a%3c yesternight.%0a%3c %0a%3c 31:43 And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, These daughters are my%0a%3c daughters, and these children are my children, and these cattle are my%0a%3c cattle, and all that thou seest is mine: and what can I do this day%0a%3c unto these my daughters, or unto their children which they have born?%0a%3c 31:44 Now therefore come thou, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and%0a%3c let it be for a witness between me and thee.%0a%3c %0a%3c 31:45 And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar.%0a%3c %0a%3c 31:46 And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took%0a%3c stones, and made an heap: and they did eat there upon the heap.%0a%3c %0a%3c 31:47 And Laban called it Jegarsahadutha: but Jacob called it Galeed.%0a%3c %0a%3c 31:48 And Laban said, This heap is a witness between me and thee this%0a%3c day.%0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore was the name of it called Galeed; 31:49 And Mizpah; for he%0a%3c said, The LORD watch between me and thee, when we are absent one from%0a%3c another.%0a%3c %0a%3c 31:50 If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take other%0a%3c wives beside my daughters, no man is with us; see, God is witness%0a%3c betwixt me and thee.%0a%3c %0a%3c 31:51 And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold this%0a%3c pillar, which I have cast betwixt me and thee: 31:52 This heap be%0a%3c witness, and this pillar be witness, that I will not pass over this%0a%3c heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this%0a%3c pillar unto me, for harm.%0a%3c %0a%3c 31:53 The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their%0a%3c father, judge betwixt us. And Jacob sware by the fear of his father%0a%3c Isaac.%0a%3c %0a%3c 31:54 Then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount, and called his%0a%3c brethren to eat bread: and they did eat bread, and tarried all night%0a%3c in the mount.%0a%3c %0a%3c 31:55 And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and%0a%3c his daughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed, and returned unto%0a%3c his place.%0a%3c %0a%3c 32:1 And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.%0a%3c %0a%3c 32:2 And when Jacob saw them, he said, This is God's host: and he%0a%3c called the name of that place Mahanaim.%0a%3c %0a%3c 32:3 And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the%0a%3c land of Seir, the country of Edom.%0a%3c %0a%3c 32:4 And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak unto my lord%0a%3c Esau; Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with Laban, and%0a%3c stayed there until now: 32:5 And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and%0a%3c menservants, and womenservants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that%0a%3c I may find grace in thy sight.%0a%3c %0a%3c 32:6 And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy%0a%3c brother Esau, and also he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men%0a%3c with him.%0a%3c %0a%3c 32:7 Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed: and he divided the%0a%3c people that was with him, and the flocks, and herds, and the camels,%0a%3c into two bands; 32:8 And said, If Esau come to the one company, and%0a%3c smite it, then the other company which is left shall escape.%0a%3c %0a%3c 32:9 And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father%0a%3c Isaac, the LORD which saidst unto me, Return unto thy country, and to%0a%3c thy kindred, and I will deal well with thee: 32:10 I am not worthy of%0a%3c the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which thou hast%0a%3c shewed unto thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan;%0a%3c and now I am become two bands.%0a%3c %0a%3c 32:11 Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the%0a%3c hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me, and the%0a%3c mother with the children.%0a%3c %0a%3c 32:12 And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed%0a%3c as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.%0a%3c %0a%3c 32:13 And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which came%0a%3c to his hand a present for Esau his brother; 32:14 Two hundred she%0a%3c goats, and twenty he goats, two hundred ewes, and twenty rams, 32:15%0a%3c Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty kine, and ten bulls,%0a%3c twenty she asses, and ten foals.%0a%3c %0a%3c 32:16 And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove%0a%3c by themselves; and said unto his servants, Pass over before me, and%0a%3c put a space betwixt drove and drove.%0a%3c %0a%3c 32:17 And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother%0a%3c meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose art thou? and whither%0a%3c goest thou? and whose are these before thee?  32:18 Then thou shalt%0a%3c say, They be thy servant Jacob's; it is a present sent unto my lord%0a%3c Esau: and, behold, also he is behind us.%0a%3c %0a%3c 32:19 And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that%0a%3c followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau,%0a%3c when ye find him.%0a%3c %0a%3c 32:20 And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us. For%0a%3c he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and%0a%3c afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept of me.%0a%3c %0a%3c 32:21 So went the present over before him: and himself lodged that%0a%3c night in the company.%0a%3c %0a%3c 32:22 And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two%0a%3c womenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford Jabbok.%0a%3c %0a%3c 32:23 And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over%0a%3c that he had.%0a%3c %0a%3c 32:24 And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him%0a%3c until the breaking of the day.%0a%3c %0a%3c 32:25 And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched%0a%3c the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of%0a%3c joint, as he wrestled with him.%0a%3c %0a%3c 32:26 And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I%0a%3c will not let thee go, except thou bless me.%0a%3c %0a%3c 32:27 And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob.%0a%3c %0a%3c 32:28 And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel:%0a%3c for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast%0a%3c prevailed.%0a%3c %0a%3c 32:29 And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name.%0a%3c And he said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name? And he%0a%3c blessed him there.%0a%3c %0a%3c 32:30 And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen%0a%3c God face to face, and my life is preserved.%0a%3c %0a%3c 32:31 And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he%0a%3c halted upon his thigh.%0a%3c %0a%3c 32:32 Therefore the children of Israel eat not of the sinew which%0a%3c shrank, which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: because%0a%3c he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew that shrank.%0a%3c %0a%3c 33:1 And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau came,%0a%3c and with him four hundred men. And he divided the children unto Leah,%0a%3c and unto Rachel, and unto the two handmaids.%0a%3c %0a%3c 33:2 And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah%0a%3c and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost.%0a%3c %0a%3c 33:3 And he passed over before them, and bowed himself to the ground%0a%3c seven times, until he came near to his brother.%0a%3c %0a%3c 33:4 And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck,%0a%3c and kissed him: and they wept.%0a%3c %0a%3c 33:5 And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children;%0a%3c and said, Who are those with thee? And he said, The children which God%0a%3c hath graciously given thy servant.%0a%3c %0a%3c 33:6 Then the handmaidens came near, they and their children, and they%0a%3c bowed themselves.%0a%3c %0a%3c 33:7 And Leah also with her children came near, and bowed themselves:%0a%3c and after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they bowed themselves.%0a%3c %0a%3c 33:8 And he said, What meanest thou by all this drove which I met? And%0a%3c he said, These are to find grace in the sight of my lord.%0a%3c %0a%3c 33:9 And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; keep that thou hast%0a%3c unto thyself.%0a%3c %0a%3c 33:10 And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found grace in%0a%3c thy sight, then receive my present at my hand: for therefore I have%0a%3c seen thy face, as though I had seen the face of God, and thou wast%0a%3c pleased with me.%0a%3c %0a%3c 33:11 Take, I pray thee, my blessing that is brought to thee; because%0a%3c God hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough. And he%0a%3c urged him, and he took it.%0a%3c %0a%3c 33:12 And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will%0a%3c go before thee.%0a%3c %0a%3c 33:13 And he said unto him, My lord knoweth that the children are%0a%3c tender, and the flocks and herds with young are with me: and if men%0a%3c should overdrive them one day, all the flock will die.%0a%3c %0a%3c 33:14 Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant: and I%0a%3c will lead on softly, according as the cattle that goeth before me and%0a%3c the children be able to endure, until I come unto my lord unto Seir.%0a%3c %0a%3c 33:15 And Esau said, Let me now leave with thee some of the folk that%0a%3c are with me. And he said, What needeth it? let me find grace in the%0a%3c sight of my lord.%0a%3c %0a%3c 33:16 So Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir.%0a%3c %0a%3c 33:17 And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him an house, and made%0a%3c booths for his cattle: therefore the name of the place is called%0a%3c Succoth.%0a%3c %0a%3c 33:18 And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which is in the%0a%3c land of Canaan, when he came from Padanaram; and pitched his tent%0a%3c before the city.%0a%3c %0a%3c 33:19 And he bought a parcel of a field, where he had spread his tent,%0a%3c at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem's father, for an hundred%0a%3c pieces of money.%0a%3c %0a%3c 33:20 And he erected there an altar, and called it EleloheIsrael.%0a%3c %0a%3c 34:1 And Dinah the daughter of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob, went%0a%3c out to see the daughters of the land.%0a%3c %0a%3c 34:2 And when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, prince of the%0a%3c country, saw her, he took her, and lay with her, and defiled her.%0a%3c %0a%3c 34:3 And his soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved%0a%3c the damsel, and spake kindly unto the damsel.%0a%3c %0a%3c 34:4 And Shechem spake unto his father Hamor, saying, Get me this%0a%3c damsel to wife.%0a%3c %0a%3c 34:5 And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter: now his%0a%3c sons were with his cattle in the field: and Jacob held his peace until%0a%3c they were come.%0a%3c %0a%3c 34:6 And Hamor the father of Shechem went out unto Jacob to commune%0a%3c with him.%0a%3c %0a%3c 34:7 And the sons of Jacob came out of the field when they heard it:%0a%3c and the men were grieved, and they were very wroth, because he had%0a%3c wrought folly in Israel in lying with Jacob's daughter: which thing%0a%3c ought not to be done.%0a%3c %0a%3c 34:8 And Hamor communed with them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem%0a%3c longeth for your daughter: I pray you give her him to wife.%0a%3c %0a%3c 34:9 And make ye marriages with us, and give your daughters unto us,%0a%3c and take our daughters unto you.%0a%3c %0a%3c 34:10 And ye shall dwell with us: and the land shall be before you;%0a%3c dwell and trade ye therein, and get you possessions therein.%0a%3c %0a%3c 34:11 And Shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren, Let me%0a%3c find grace in your eyes, and what ye shall say unto me I will give.%0a%3c %0a%3c 34:12 Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I will give according%0a%3c as ye shall say unto me: but give me the damsel to wife.%0a%3c %0a%3c 34:13 And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father%0a%3c deceitfully, and said, because he had defiled Dinah their sister:%0a%3c 34:14 And they said unto them, We cannot do this thing, to give our%0a%3c sister to one that is uncircumcised; for that were a reproach unto us:%0a%3c 34:15 But in this will we consent unto you: If ye will be as we be,%0a%3c that every male of you be circumcised; 34:16 Then will we give our%0a%3c daughters unto you, and we will take your daughters to us, and we will%0a%3c dwell with you, and we will become one people.%0a%3c %0a%3c 34:17 But if ye will not hearken unto us, to be circumcised; then will%0a%3c we take our daughter, and we will be gone.%0a%3c %0a%3c 34:18 And their words pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor's son.%0a%3c %0a%3c 34:19 And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had%0a%3c delight in Jacob's daughter: and he was more honourable than all the%0a%3c house of his father.%0a%3c %0a%3c 34:20 And Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate of their city,%0a%3c and communed with the men of their city, saying, 34:21 These men are%0a%3c peaceable with us; therefore let them dwell in the land, and trade%0a%3c therein; for the land, behold, it is large enough for them; let us%0a%3c take their daughters to us for wives, and let us give them our%0a%3c daughters.%0a%3c %0a%3c 34:22 Only herein will the men consent unto us for to dwell with us,%0a%3c to be one people, if every male among us be circumcised, as they are%0a%3c circumcised.%0a%3c %0a%3c 34:23 Shall not their cattle and their substance and every beast of%0a%3c their's be our's? only let us consent unto them, and they will dwell%0a%3c with us.%0a%3c %0a%3c 34:24 And unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened all that went%0a%3c out of the gate of his city; and every male was circumcised, all that%0a%3c went out of the gate of his city.%0a%3c %0a%3c 34:25 And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore, that%0a%3c two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brethren, took each%0a%3c man his sword, and came upon the city boldly, and slew all the males.%0a%3c %0a%3c 34:26 And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the%0a%3c sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem's house, and went out.%0a%3c %0a%3c 34:27 The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and spoiled the city,%0a%3c because they had defiled their sister.%0a%3c %0a%3c 34:28 They took their sheep, and their oxen, and their asses, and that%0a%3c which was in the city, and that which was in the field, 34:29 And all%0a%3c their wealth, and all their little ones, and their wives took they%0a%3c captive, and spoiled even all that was in the house.%0a%3c %0a%3c 34:30 And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me to make%0a%3c me to stink among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites%0a%3c and the Perizzites: and I being few in number, they shall gather%0a%3c themselves together against me, and slay me; and I shall be destroyed,%0a%3c I and my house.%0a%3c %0a%3c 34:31 And they said, Should he deal with our sister as with an harlot?%0a%3c 35:1 And God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwell there:%0a%3c and make there an altar unto God, that appeared unto thee when thou%0a%3c fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother.%0a%3c %0a%3c 35:2 Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were with%0a%3c him, Put away the strange gods that are among you, and be clean, and%0a%3c change your garments: 35:3 And let us arise, and go up to Bethel; and%0a%3c I will make there an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my%0a%3c distress, and was with me in the way which I went.%0a%3c %0a%3c 35:4 And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which were in their%0a%3c hand, and all their earrings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid%0a%3c them under the oak which was by Shechem.%0a%3c %0a%3c 35:5 And they journeyed: and the terror of God was upon the cities%0a%3c that were round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of%0a%3c Jacob.%0a%3c %0a%3c 35:6 So Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan, that is,%0a%3c Bethel, he and all the people that were with him.%0a%3c %0a%3c 35:7 And he built there an altar, and called the place Elbethel:%0a%3c because there God appeared unto him, when he fled from the face of his%0a%3c brother.%0a%3c %0a%3c 35:8 But Deborah Rebekah's nurse died, and she was buried beneath%0a%3c Bethel under an oak: and the name of it was called Allonbachuth.%0a%3c %0a%3c 35:9 And God appeared unto Jacob again, when he came out of Padanaram,%0a%3c and blessed him.%0a%3c %0a%3c 35:10 And God said unto him, Thy name is Jacob: thy name shall not be%0a%3c called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name: and he called his%0a%3c name Israel.%0a%3c %0a%3c 35:11 And God said unto him, I am God Almighty: be fruitful and%0a%3c multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee, and%0a%3c kings shall come out of thy loins; 35:12 And the land which I gave%0a%3c Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will give it, and to thy seed after thee%0a%3c will I give the land.%0a%3c %0a%3c 35:13 And God went up from him in the place where he talked with him.%0a%3c %0a%3c 35:14 And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him,%0a%3c even a pillar of stone: and he poured a drink offering thereon, and he%0a%3c poured oil thereon.%0a%3c %0a%3c 35:15 And Jacob called the name of the place where God spake with him,%0a%3c Bethel.%0a%3c %0a%3c 35:16 And they journeyed from Bethel; and there was but a little way%0a%3c to come to Ephrath: and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labour.%0a%3c %0a%3c 35:17 And it came to pass, when she was in hard labour, that the%0a%3c midwife said unto her, Fear not; thou shalt have this son also.%0a%3c %0a%3c 35:18 And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing, (for she%0a%3c died) that she called his name Benoni: but his father called him%0a%3c Benjamin.%0a%3c %0a%3c 35:19 And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath, which is%0a%3c Bethlehem.%0a%3c %0a%3c 35:20 And Jacob set a pillar upon her grave: that is the pillar of%0a%3c Rachel's grave unto this day.%0a%3c %0a%3c 35:21 And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of%0a%3c Edar.%0a%3c %0a%3c 35:22 And it came to pass, when Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben%0a%3c went and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine: and Israel heard it.%0a%3c Now the sons of Jacob were twelve: 35:23 The sons of Leah; Reuben,%0a%3c Jacob's firstborn, and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and%0a%3c Zebulun: 35:24 The sons of Rachel; Joseph, and Benjamin: 35:25 And the%0a%3c sons of Bilhah, Rachel's handmaid; Dan, and Naphtali: 35:26 And the%0a%3c sons of Zilpah, Leah's handmaid: Gad, and Asher: these are the sons of%0a%3c Jacob, which were born to him in Padanaram.%0a%3c %0a%3c 35:27 And Jacob came unto Isaac his father unto Mamre, unto the city%0a%3c of Arbah, which is Hebron, where Abraham and Isaac sojourned.%0a%3c %0a%3c 35:28 And the days of Isaac were an hundred and fourscore years.%0a%3c %0a%3c 35:29 And Isaac gave up the ghost, and died, and was gathered unto his%0a%3c people, being old and full of days: and his sons Esau and Jacob buried%0a%3c him.%0a%3c %0a%3c 36:1 Now these are the generations of Esau, who is Edom.%0a%3c %0a%3c 36:2 Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan; Adah the daughter%0a%3c of Elon the Hittite, and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah the daughter%0a%3c of Zibeon the Hivite; 36:3 And Bashemath Ishmael's daughter, sister of%0a%3c Nebajoth.%0a%3c %0a%3c 36:4 And Adah bare to Esau Eliphaz; and Bashemath bare Reuel; 36:5 And%0a%3c Aholibamah bare Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah: these are the sons of%0a%3c Esau, which were born unto him in the land of Canaan.%0a%3c %0a%3c 36:6 And Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and all%0a%3c the persons of his house, and his cattle, and all his beasts, and all%0a%3c his substance, which he had got in the land of Canaan; and went into%0a%3c the country from the face of his brother Jacob.%0a%3c %0a%3c 36:7 For their riches were more than that they might dwell together;%0a%3c and the land wherein they were strangers could not bear them because%0a%3c of their cattle.%0a%3c %0a%3c 36:8 Thus dwelt Esau in mount Seir: Esau is Edom.%0a%3c %0a%3c 36:9 And these are the generations of Esau the father of the Edomites%0a%3c in mount Seir: 36:10 These are the names of Esau's sons; Eliphaz the%0a%3c son of Adah the wife of Esau, Reuel the son of Bashemath the wife of%0a%3c Esau.%0a%3c %0a%3c 36:11 And the sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, and Gatam, and%0a%3c Kenaz.%0a%3c %0a%3c 36:12 And Timna was concubine to Eliphaz Esau's son;

Joseph, being seventeen years%0a%3c old, was feeding the flock with his brethren; and the lad was with the%0a%3c sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his father's wives: and%0a%3c Joseph brought unto his father their evil report.%0a%3c %0a%3c 37:3 Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he%0a%3c was the son of his old age: and he made him a coat of many colours.%0a%3c %0a%3c 37:4 And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than%0a%3c all his brethren, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto%0a%3c him.%0a%3c %0a%3c 37:5 And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it his brethren: and they%0a%3c hated him yet the more.%0a%3c %0a%3c 37:6 And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have%0a%3c dreamed: 37:7 For, behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and,%0a%3c lo, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your sheaves%0a%3c stood round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf.%0a%3c %0a%3c 37:8 And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? or%0a%3c shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him yet the%0a%3c more for his dreams, and for his words.%0a%3c %0a%3c 37:9 And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his brethren, and%0a%3c said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and, behold, the sun and%0a%3c the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me.%0a%3c %0a%3c 37:10 And he told it to his father, and to his brethren: and his%0a%3c father rebuked him, and said unto him, What is this dream that thou%0a%3c hast dreamed?  Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to%0a%3c bow down ourselves to thee to the earth?  37:11 And his brethren%0a%3c envied him; but his father observed the saying.%0a%3c %0a%3c 37:12 And his brethren went to feed their father's flock in Shechem.%0a%3c %0a%3c 37:13 And Israel said unto Joseph, Do not thy brethren feed the flock%0a%3c in Shechem? come, and I will send thee unto them. And he said to him,%0a%3c Here am I.%0a%3c %0a%3c 37:14 And he said to him, Go, I pray thee, see whether it be well with%0a%3c thy brethren, and well with the flocks; and bring me word again. So he%0a%3c sent him out of the vale of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.%0a%3c %0a%3c 37:15 And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering in%0a%3c the field: and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou?  37:16%0a%3c And he said, I seek my brethren: tell me, I pray thee, where they feed%0a%3c their flocks.%0a%3c %0a%3c 37:17 And the man said, They are departed hence; for I heard them say,%0a%3c Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brethren, and found%0a%3c them in Dothan.%0a%3c %0a%3c 37:18 And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near unto%0a%3c them, they conspired against him to slay him.%0a%3c %0a%3c 37:19 And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh.%0a%3c %0a%3c 37:20 Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into some%0a%3c pit, and we will say, Some evil beast hath devoured him: and we shall%0a%3c see what will become of his dreams.%0a%3c %0a%3c 37:21 And Reuben heard it, and he delivered him out of their hands;%0a%3c and said, Let us not kill him.%0a%3c %0a%3c 37:22 And Reuben said unto them, Shed no blood, but cast him into this%0a%3c pit that is in the wilderness, and lay no hand upon him; that he might%0a%3c rid him out of their hands, to deliver him to his father again.%0a%3c %0a%3c 37:23 And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren,%0a%3c that they stript Joseph out of his coat, his coat of many colours that%0a%3c was on him; 37:24 And they took him, and cast him into a pit: and the%0a%3c pit was empty, there was no water in it.%0a%3c %0a%3c 37:25 And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes%0a%3c and looked, and, behold, a company of Ishmeelites came from Gilead%0a%3c with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh, going to carry%0a%3c it down to Egypt.%0a%3c %0a%3c 37:26 And Judah said unto his brethren, What profit is it if we slay%0a%3c our brother, and conceal his blood?  37:27 Come, and let us sell him%0a%3c to the Ishmeelites, and let not our hand be upon him; for he is our%0a%3c brother and our flesh. And his brethren were content.%0a%3c %0a%3c 37:28 Then there passed by Midianites merchantmen; and they drew and%0a%3c lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmeelites%0a%3c for twenty pieces of silver: and they brought Joseph into Egypt.%0a%3c %0a%3c 37:29 And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph was not in%0a%3c the pit; and he rent his clothes.%0a%3c %0a%3c 37:30 And he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child is not;%0a%3c and I, whither shall I go?  37:31 And they took Joseph's coat, and%0a%3c killed a kid of the goats, and dipped the coat in the blood; 37:32 And%0a%3c they sent the coat of many colours, and they brought it to their%0a%3c father; and said, This have we found: know now whether it be thy son's%0a%3c coat or no.%0a%3c %0a%3c 37:33 And he knew it, and said, It is my son's coat; an evil beast%0a%3c hath devoured him; Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces.%0a%3c %0a%3c 37:34 And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins,%0a%3c and mourned for his son many days.%0a%3c %0a%3c 37:35 And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him;%0a%3c but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down into%0a%3c the grave unto my son mourning. Thus his father wept for him.%0a%3c %0a%3c 37:36 And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer%0a%3c of Pharaoh's, and captain of the guard.%0a%3c %0a%3c 38:1 And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his%0a%3c brethren, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah.%0a%3c %0a%3c 38:2 And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose name%0a%3c was Shuah; and he took her, and went in unto her.%0a%3c %0a%3c 38:3 And she conceived, and bare a son; and he called his name Er.%0a%3c %0a%3c 38:4 And she conceived again, and bare a son; and she called his name%0a%3c Onan.%0a%3c %0a%3c 38:5 And she yet again conceived, and bare a son; and called his name%0a%3c Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bare him.%0a%3c %0a%3c 38:6 And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, whose name was Tamar.%0a%3c %0a%3c 38:7 And Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the LORD;%0a%3c and the LORD slew him.%0a%3c %0a%3c 38:8 And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother's wife, and%0a%3c marry her, and raise up seed to thy brother.%0a%3c %0a%3c 38:9 And Onan knew that the seed should not be his; and it came to%0a%3c pass, when he went in unto his brother's wife, that he spilled it on%0a%3c the ground, lest that he should give seed to his brother.%0a%3c %0a%3c 38:10 And the thing which he did displeased the LORD: wherefore he%0a%3c slew him also.%0a%3c %0a%3c 38:11 Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter in law, Remain a widow at%0a%3c thy father's house, till Shelah my son be grown: for he said, Lest%0a%3c peradventure he die also, as his brethren did. And Tamar went and%0a%3c dwelt in her father's house.%0a%3c %0a%3c 38:12 And in process of time the daughter of Shuah Judah's wife died;%0a%3c and Judah was comforted, and went up unto his sheepshearers to%0a%3c Timnath, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.%0a%3c %0a%3c 38:13 And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold thy father in law goeth up%0a%3c to Timnath to shear his sheep.%0a%3c %0a%3c 38:14 And she put her widow's garments off from her, and covered her%0a%3c with a vail, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place, which is%0a%3c by the way to Timnath; for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was%0a%3c not given unto him to wife.%0a%3c %0a%3c 38:15 When Judah saw her, he thought her to be an harlot; because she%0a%3c had covered her face.%0a%3c %0a%3c 38:16 And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray thee,%0a%3c let me come in unto thee; (for he knew not that she was his daughter%0a%3c in law.) And she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come%0a%3c in unto me?  38:17 And he said, I will send thee a kid from the flock.%0a%3c And she said, Wilt thou give me a pledge, till thou send it?  38:18%0a%3c And he said, What pledge shall I give thee? And she said, Thy signet,%0a%3c and thy bracelets, and thy staff that is in thine hand. And he gave it%0a%3c her, and came in unto her, and she conceived by him.%0a%3c %0a%3c 38:19 And she arose, and went away, and laid by her vail from her, and%0a%3c put on the garments of her widowhood.%0a%3c %0a%3c 38:20 And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite,%0a%3c to receive his pledge from the woman's hand: but he found her not.%0a%3c %0a%3c 38:21 Then he asked the men of that place, saying, Where is the%0a%3c harlot, that was openly by the way side? And they said, There was no%0a%3c harlot in this place.%0a%3c %0a%3c 38:22 And he returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her; and also%0a%3c the men of the place said, that there was no harlot in this place.%0a%3c %0a%3c 38:23 And Judah said, Let her take it to her, lest we be shamed:%0a%3c behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her.%0a%3c %0a%3c 38:24 And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told%0a%3c Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot; and%0a%3c also, behold, she is with child by whoredom. And Judah said, Bring her%0a%3c forth, and let her be burnt.%0a%3c %0a%3c 38:25 When she was brought forth, she sent to her father in law,%0a%3c saying, By the man, whose these are, am I with child: and she said,%0a%3c Discern, I pray thee, whose are these, the signet, and bracelets, and%0a%3c staff.%0a%3c %0a%3c 38:26 And Judah acknowledged them, and said, She hath been more%0a%3c righteous than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my son. And he%0a%3c knew her again no more.%0a%3c %0a%3c 38:27 And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold,%0a%3c twins were in her womb.%0a%3c %0a%3c 38:28 And it came to pass, when she travailed, that the one put out%0a%3c his hand: and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet%0a%3c thread, saying, This came out first.%0a%3c %0a%3c 38:29 And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his%0a%3c brother came out: and she said, How hast thou broken forth? this%0a%3c breach be upon thee: therefore his name was called Pharez.%0a%3c %0a%3c 38:30 And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet thread%0a%3c upon his hand: and his name was called Zarah.%0a%3c %0a%3c 39:1 And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer of%0a%3c Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hands of%0a%3c the Ishmeelites, which had brought him down thither.%0a%3c %0a%3c 39:2 And the LORD was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he%0a%3c was in the house of his master the Egyptian.%0a%3c %0a%3c 39:3 And his master saw that the LORD was with him, and that the LORD%0a%3c made all that he did to prosper in his hand.%0a%3c %0a%3c 39:4 And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him: and he%0a%3c made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his%0a%3c hand.%0a%3c %0a%3c 39:5 And it came to pass from the time that he had made him overseer%0a%3c in his house, and over all that he had, that the LORD blessed the%0a%3c Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake; and the blessing of the LORD was%0a%3c upon all that he had in the house, and in the field.%0a%3c %0a%3c 39:6 And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand; and he knew not%0a%3c ought he had, save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was a goodly%0a%3c person, and well favoured.%0a%3c %0a%3c 39:7 And it came to pass after these things, that his master's wife%0a%3c cast her eyes upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me.%0a%3c %0a%3c 39:8 But he refused, and said unto his master's wife, Behold, my%0a%3c master wotteth not what is with me in the house, and he hath committed%0a%3c all that he hath to my hand; 39:9 There is none greater in this house%0a%3c than I; neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee, because%0a%3c thou art his wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin%0a%3c against God?  39:10 And it came to pass, as she spake to Joseph day by%0a%3c day, that he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, or to be with her.%0a%3c %0a%3c 39:11 And it came to pass about this time, that Joseph went into the%0a%3c house to do his business; and there was none of the men of the house%0a%3c there within.%0a%3c %0a%3c 39:12 And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he%0a%3c left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out.%0a%3c %0a%3c 39:13 And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment%0a%3c in her hand, and was fled forth, 39:14 That she called unto the men of%0a%3c her house, and spake unto them, saying, See, he hath brought in an%0a%3c Hebrew unto us to mock us; he came in unto me to lie with me, and I%0a%3c cried with a loud voice: 39:15 And it came to pass, when he heard that%0a%3c I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and%0a%3c fled, and got him out.%0a%3c %0a%3c 39:16 And she laid up his garment by her, until his lord came home.%0a%3c %0a%3c 39:17 And she spake unto him according to these words, saying, The%0a%3c Hebrew servant, which thou hast brought unto us, came in unto me to%0a%3c mock me: 39:18 And it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried,%0a%3c that he left his garment with me, and fled out.%0a%3c %0a%3c 39:19 And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his%0a%3c wife, which she spake unto him, saying, After this manner did thy%0a%3c servant to me; that his wrath was kindled.%0a%3c %0a%3c 39:20 And Joseph's master took him, and put him into the prison, a%0a%3c place where the king's prisoners were bound: and he was there in the%0a%3c prison.%0a%3c %0a%3c 39:21 But the LORD was with Joseph, and shewed him mercy, and gave him%0a%3c favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison.%0a%3c %0a%3c 39:22 And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand all the%0a%3c prisoners that were in the prison; and whatsoever they did there, he%0a%3c was the doer of it.%0a%3c %0a%3c 39:23 The keeper of the prison looked not to any thing that was under%0a%3c his hand; because the LORD was with him, and that which he did, the%0a%3c LORD made it to prosper.%0a%3c %0a%3c 40:1 And it came to pass after these things, that the butler of the%0a%3c king of Egypt and his baker had offended their lord the king of Egypt.%0a%3c %0a%3c 40:2 And Pharaoh was wroth against two of his officers, against the%0a%3c chief of the butlers, and against the chief of the bakers.%0a%3c %0a%3c 40:3 And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard,%0a%3c into the prison, the place where Joseph was bound.%0a%3c %0a%3c 40:4 And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he%0a%3c served them: and they continued a season in ward.%0a%3c %0a%3c 40:5 And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream in one%0a%3c night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the%0a%3c butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, which were bound in the%0a%3c prison.%0a%3c %0a%3c 40:6 And Joseph came in unto them in the morning, and looked upon%0a%3c them, and, behold, they were sad.%0a%3c %0a%3c 40:7 And he asked Pharaoh's officers that were with him in the ward of%0a%3c his lord's house, saying, Wherefore look ye so sadly to day?  40:8 And%0a%3c they said unto him, We have dreamed a dream, and there is no%0a%3c interpreter of it. And Joseph said unto them, Do not interpretations%0a%3c belong to God? tell me them, I pray you.%0a%3c %0a%3c 40:9 And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him,%0a%3c In my dream, behold, a vine was before me; 40:10 And in the vine were%0a%3c three branches: and it was as though it budded, and her blossoms shot%0a%3c forth; and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes: 40:11 And%0a%3c Pharaoh's cup was in my hand: and I took the grapes, and pressed them%0a%3c into Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand.%0a%3c %0a%3c 40:12 And Joseph said unto him, This is the interpretation of it: The%0a%3c three branches are three days: 40:13 Yet within three days shall%0a%3c Pharaoh lift up thine head, and restore thee unto thy place: and thou%0a%3c shalt deliver Pharaoh's cup into his hand, after the former manner%0a%3c when thou wast his butler.%0a%3c %0a%3c 40:14 But think on me when it shall be well with thee, and shew%0a%3c kindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh,%0a%3c and bring me out of this house: 40:15 For indeed I was stolen away out%0a%3c of the land of the Hebrews: and here also have I done nothing that%0a%3c they should put me into the dungeon.%0a%3c %0a%3c 40:16 When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he%0a%3c said unto Joseph, I also was in my dream, and, behold, I had three%0a%3c white baskets on my head: 40:17 And in the uppermost basket there was%0a%3c of all manner of bakemeats for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out%0a%3c of the basket upon my head.%0a%3c %0a%3c 40:18 And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation%0a%3c thereof: The three baskets are three days: 40:19 Yet within three days%0a%3c shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and shall hang thee on a%0a%3c tree; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee.%0a%3c %0a%3c 40:20 And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday,%0a%3c that he made a feast unto all his servants: and he lifted up the head%0a%3c of the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants.%0a%3c %0a%3c 40:21 And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again; and%0a%3c he gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand: 40:22 But he hanged the chief%0a%3c baker: as Joseph had interpreted to them.%0a%3c %0a%3c 40:23 Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat him.%0a%3c %0a%3c 41:1 And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh%0a%3c dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river.%0a%3c %0a%3c 41:2 And, behold, there came up out of the river seven well favoured%0a%3c kine and fatfleshed; and they fed in a meadow.%0a%3c %0a%3c 41:3 And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the%0a%3c river, ill favoured and leanfleshed; and stood by the other kine upon%0a%3c the brink of the river.%0a%3c %0a%3c 41:4 And the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven%0a%3c well favoured and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke.%0a%3c %0a%3c 41:5 And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven ears%0a%3c of corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good.%0a%3c %0a%3c 41:6 And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind%0a%3c sprung up after them.%0a%3c %0a%3c 41:7 And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears.%0a%3c And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was a dream.%0a%3c %0a%3c 41:8 And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled;%0a%3c and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the%0a%3c wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but there was none%0a%3c that could interpret them unto Pharaoh.%0a%3c %0a%3c 41:9 Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember%0a%3c my faults this day: 41:10 Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put%0a%3c me in ward in the captain of the guard's house, both me and the chief%0a%3c baker: 41:11 And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed%0a%3c each man according to the interpretation of his dream.%0a%3c %0a%3c 41:12 And there was there with us a young man, an Hebrew, servant to%0a%3c the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us%0a%3c our dreams; to each man according to his dream he did interpret.%0a%3c %0a%3c 41:13 And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he%0a%3c restored unto mine office, and him he hanged.%0a%3c %0a%3c 41:14 Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him%0a%3c hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved himself, and changed his%0a%3c raiment, and came in unto Pharaoh.%0a%3c %0a%3c 41:15 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and there%0a%3c is none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of thee, that thou%0a%3c canst understand a dream to interpret it.%0a%3c %0a%3c 41:16 And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: God shall%0a%3c give Pharaoh an answer of peace.%0a%3c %0a%3c 41:17 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon%0a%3c the bank of the river: 41:18 And, behold, there came up out of the%0a%3c river seven kine, fatfleshed and well favoured; and they fed in a%0a%3c meadow: 41:19 And, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor%0a%3c and very ill favoured and leanfleshed, such as I never saw in all the%0a%3c land of Egypt for badness: 41:20 And the lean and the ill favoured%0a%3c kine did eat up the first seven fat kine: 41:21 And when they had%0a%3c eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but%0a%3c they were still ill favoured, as at the beginning. So I awoke.%0a%3c %0a%3c 41:22 And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in one%0a%3c stalk, full and good: 41:23 And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin,%0a%3c and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them: 41:24 And the%0a%3c thin ears devoured the seven good ears: and I told this unto the%0a%3c magicians; but there was none that could declare it to me.%0a%3c %0a%3c 41:25 And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one: God%0a%3c hath shewed Pharaoh what he is about to do.%0a%3c %0a%3c 41:26 The seven good kine are seven years; and the seven good ears are%0a%3c seven years: the dream is one.%0a%3c %0a%3c 41:27 And the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after them%0a%3c are seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind%0a%3c shall be seven years of famine.%0a%3c %0a%3c 41:28 This is the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: What God is%0a%3c about to do he sheweth unto Pharaoh.%0a%3c %0a%3c 41:29 Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all%0a%3c the land of Egypt: 41:30 And there shall arise after them seven years%0a%3c of famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt;%0a%3c and the famine shall consume the land; 41:31 And the plenty shall not%0a%3c be known in the land by reason of that famine following; for it shall%0a%3c be very grievous.%0a%3c %0a%3c 41:32 And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; it is%0a%3c because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it%0a%3c to pass.%0a%3c %0a%3c 41:33 Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and%0a%3c set him over the land of Egypt.%0a%3c %0a%3c 41:34 Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint officers over the land,%0a%3c and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous%0a%3c years.%0a%3c %0a%3c 41:35 And let them gather all the food of those good years that come,%0a%3c and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them keep food in%0a%3c the cities.%0a%3c %0a%3c 41:36 And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven%0a%3c years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land%0a%3c perish not through the famine.%0a%3c %0a%3c 41:37 And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes%0a%3c of all his servants.%0a%3c %0a%3c 41:38 And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find such a one as%0a%3c this is, a man in whom the Spirit of God is?  41:39 And Pharaoh said%0a%3c unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shewed thee all this, there is none%0a%3c so discreet and wise as thou art: 41:40 Thou shalt be over my house,%0a%3c and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled: only in the%0a%3c throne will I be greater than thou.%0a%3c %0a%3c 41:41 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the%0a%3c land of Egypt.%0a%3c %0a%3c 41:42 And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon%0a%3c Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a%0a%3c gold chain about his neck; 41:43 And he made him to ride in the second%0a%3c chariot which he had; and they cried before him, Bow the knee: and he%0a%3c made him ruler over all the land of Egypt.%0a%3c %0a%3c 41:44 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without thee%0a%3c shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.%0a%3c %0a%3c 41:45 And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphnathpaaneah; and he gave%0a%3c him to wife Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On. And%0a%3c Joseph went out over all the land of Egypt.%0a%3c %0a%3c 41:46 And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh%0a%3c king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and%0a%3c went throughout all the land of Egypt.%0a%3c %0a%3c 41:47 And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by%0a%3c handfuls.%0a%3c %0a%3c 41:48 And he gathered up all the food of the seven years, which were%0a%3c in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of%0a%3c the field, which was round about every city, laid he up in the same.%0a%3c %0a%3c 41:49 And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much,%0a%3c until he left numbering; for it was without number.%0a%3c %0a%3c 41:50 And unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine%0a%3c came, which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On bare unto%0a%3c him.%0a%3c %0a%3c 41:51 And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For God,%0a%3c said he, hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father's house.%0a%3c %0a%3c 41:52 And the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God hath%0a%3c caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.%0a%3c %0a%3c 41:53 And the seven years of plenteousness, that was in the land of%0a%3c Egypt, were ended.%0a%3c %0a%3c 41:54 And the seven years of dearth began to come, according as Joseph%0a%3c had said: and the dearth was in all lands; but in all the land of%0a%3c Egypt there was bread.%0a%3c %0a%3c 41:55 And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to%0a%3c Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, Go unto%0a%3c Joseph; what he saith to you, do.%0a%3c %0a%3c 41:56 And the famine was over all the face of the earth: and Joseph%0a%3c opened all the storehouses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and the%0a%3c famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt.%0a%3c %0a%3c 41:57 And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy corn;%0a%3c because that the famine was so sore in all lands.%0a%3c %0a%3c 42:1 Now when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob said unto%0a%3c his sons, Why do ye look one upon another?  42:2 And he said, Behold,%0a%3c I have heard that there is corn in Egypt: get you down thither, and%0a%3c buy for us from thence; that we may live, and not die.%0a%3c %0a%3c 42:3 And Joseph's ten brethren went down to buy corn in Egypt.%0a%3c %0a%3c 42:4 But Benjamin, Joseph's brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren;%0a%3c for he said, Lest peradventure mischief befall him.%0a%3c %0a%3c 42:5 And the sons of Israel came to buy corn among those that came:%0a%3c for the famine was in the land of Canaan.%0a%3c %0a%3c 42:6 And Joseph was the governor over the land, and he it was that%0a%3c sold to all the people of the land: and Joseph's brethren came, and%0a%3c bowed down themselves before him with their faces to the earth.%0a%3c %0a%3c 42:7 And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself%0a%3c strange unto them, and spake roughly unto them; and he said unto them,%0a%3c Whence come ye? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food.%0a%3c %0a%3c 42:8 And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him.%0a%3c %0a%3c 42:9 And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and%0a%3c said unto them, Ye are spies; to see the nakedness of the land ye are%0a%3c come.%0a%3c %0a%3c 42:10 And they said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy%0a%3c servants come.%0a%3c %0a%3c 42:11 We are all one man's sons; we are true men, thy servants are no%0a%3c spies.%0a%3c %0a%3c 42:12 And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the land%0a%3c ye are come.%0a%3c %0a%3c 42:13 And they said, Thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of one%0a%3c man in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest is this day with%0a%3c our father, and one is not.%0a%3c %0a%3c 42:14 And Joseph said unto them, That is it that I spake unto you,%0a%3c saying, Ye are spies: 42:15 Hereby ye shall be proved: By the life of%0a%3c Pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother come%0a%3c hither.%0a%3c %0a%3c 42:16 Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall be%0a%3c kept in prison, that your words may be proved, whether there be any%0a%3c truth in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye are spies.%0a%3c %0a%3c 42:17 And he put them all together into ward three days.%0a%3c %0a%3c 42:18 And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live; for%0a%3c I fear God: 42:19 If ye be true men, let one of your brethren be bound%0a%3c in the house of your prison: go ye, carry corn for the famine of your%0a%3c houses: 42:20 But bring your youngest brother unto me; so shall your%0a%3c words be verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so.%0a%3c %0a%3c 42:21 And they said one to another, We are verily guilty concerning%0a%3c our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he besought%0a%3c us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us.%0a%3c %0a%3c 42:22 And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you, saying,%0a%3c Do not sin against the child; and ye would not hear? therefore,%0a%3c behold, also his blood is required.%0a%3c %0a%3c 42:23 And they knew not that Joseph understood them; for he spake unto%0a%3c them by an interpreter.%0a%3c %0a%3c 42:24 And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and returned to%0a%3c them again, and communed with them, and took from them Simeon, and%0a%3c bound him before their eyes.%0a%3c %0a%3c 42:25 Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn, and to%0a%3c restore every man's money into his sack, and to give them provision%0a%3c for the way: and thus did he unto them.%0a%3c %0a%3c 42:26 And they laded their asses with the corn, and departed thence.%0a%3c %0a%3c 42:27 And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in%0a%3c the inn, he espied his money; for, behold, it was in his sack's mouth.%0a%3c %0a%3c 42:28 And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo, it%0a%3c is even in my sack: and their heart failed them, and they were afraid,%0a%3c saying one to another, What is this that God hath done unto us?  42:29%0a%3c And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan, and%0a%3c told him all that befell unto them; saying, 42:30 The man, who is the%0a%3c lord of the land, spake roughly to us, and took us for spies of the%0a%3c country.%0a%3c %0a%3c 42:31 And we said unto him, We are true men; we are no spies: 42:32 We%0a%3c be twelve brethren, sons of our father; one is not, and the youngest%0a%3c is this day with our father in the land of Canaan.%0a%3c %0a%3c 42:33 And the man, the lord of the country, said unto us, Hereby shall%0a%3c I know that ye are true men; leave one of your brethren here with me,%0a%3c and take food for the famine of your households, and be gone: 42:34%0a%3c And bring your youngest brother unto me: then shall I know that ye are%0a%3c no spies, but that ye are true men: so will I deliver you your%0a%3c brother, and ye shall traffick in the land.%0a%3c %0a%3c 42:35 And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold,%0a%3c every man's bundle of money was in his sack: and when both they and%0a%3c their father saw the bundles of money, they were afraid.%0a%3c %0a%3c 42:36 And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved of my%0a%3c children: Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will take Benjamin%0a%3c away: all these things are against me.%0a%3c %0a%3c 42:37 And Reuben spake unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I%0a%3c bring him not to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him%0a%3c to thee again.%0a%3c %0a%3c 42:38 And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother%0a%3c is dead, and he is left alone: if mischief befall him by the way in%0a%3c the which ye go, then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to%0a%3c the grave.%0a%3c %0a%3c 43:1 And the famine was sore in the land.%0a%3c %0a%3c 43:2 And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the corn which they%0a%3c had brought out of Egypt, their father said unto them, Go again, buy%0a%3c us a little food.%0a%3c %0a%3c 43:3 And Judah spake unto him, saying, The man did solemnly protest%0a%3c unto us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with%0a%3c you.%0a%3c %0a%3c 43:4 If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy%0a%3c thee food: 43:5 But if thou wilt not send him, we will not go down:%0a%3c for the man said unto us, Ye shall not see my face, except your%0a%3c brother be with you.%0a%3c %0a%3c 43:6 And Israel said, Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me, as to tell%0a%3c the man whether ye had yet a brother?  43:7 And they said, The man%0a%3c asked us straitly of our state, and of our kindred, saying, Is your%0a%3c father yet alive? have ye another brother? and we told him according%0a%3c to the tenor of these words: could we certainly know that he would%0a%3c say, Bring your brother down?  43:8 And Judah said unto Israel his%0a%3c father, Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go; that we may%0a%3c live, and not die, both we, and thou, and also our little ones.%0a%3c %0a%3c 43:9 I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him: if I%0a%3c bring him not unto thee, and set him before thee, then let me bear the%0a%3c blame for ever: 43:10 For except we had lingered, surely now we had%0a%3c returned this second time.%0a%3c %0a%3c 43:11 And their father Israel said unto them, If it must be so now, do%0a%3c this; take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels, and carry%0a%3c down the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spices, and%0a%3c myrrh, nuts, and almonds: 43:12 And take double money in your hand;%0a%3c and the money that was brought again in the mouth of your sacks, carry%0a%3c it again in your hand; peradventure it was an oversight: 43:13 Take%0a%3c also your brother, and arise, go again unto the man: 43:14 And God%0a%3c Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may send away your%0a%3c other brother, and Benjamin. If I be bereaved of my children, I am%0a%3c bereaved.%0a%3c %0a%3c 43:15 And the men took that present, and they took double money in%0a%3c their hand and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt, and%0a%3c stood before Joseph.%0a%3c %0a%3c 43:16 And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler of%0a%3c his house, Bring these men home, and slay, and make ready; for these%0a%3c men shall dine with me at noon.%0a%3c %0a%3c 43:17 And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men into%0a%3c Joseph's house.%0a%3c %0a%3c 43:18 And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph's%0a%3c house; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our%0a%3c sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion%0a%3c against us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our asses.%0a%3c %0a%3c 43:19 And they came near to the steward of Joseph's house, and they%0a%3c communed with him at the door of the house, 43:20 And said, O sir, we%0a%3c came indeed down at the first time to buy food: 43:21 And it came to%0a%3c pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened our sacks, and, behold,%0a%3c every man's money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full%0a%3c weight: and we have brought it again in our hand.%0a%3c %0a%3c 43:22 And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food:%0a%3c we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks.%0a%3c %0a%3c 43:23 And he said, Peace be to you, fear not: your God, and the God of%0a%3c your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks: I had your money.%0a%3c And he brought Simeon out unto them.%0a%3c %0a%3c 43:24 And the man brought the men into Joseph's house, and gave them%0a%3c water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses provender.%0a%3c %0a%3c 43:25 And they made ready the present against Joseph came at noon: for%0a%3c they heard that they should eat bread there.%0a%3c %0a%3c 43:26 And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which%0a%3c was in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to him to the%0a%3c earth.%0a%3c %0a%3c 43:27 And he asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your father%0a%3c well, the old man of whom ye spake? Is he yet alive?  43:28 And they%0a%3c answered, Thy servant our father is in good health, he is yet alive.%0a%3c And they bowed down their heads, and made obeisance.%0a%3c %0a%3c 43:29 And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his%0a%3c mother's son, and said, Is this your younger brother, of whom ye spake%0a%3c unto me? And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my son.%0a%3c %0a%3c 43:30 And Joseph made haste; for his bowels did yearn upon his%0a%3c brother: and he sought where to weep; and he entered into his chamber,%0a%3c and wept there.%0a%3c %0a%3c 43:31 And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself, and%0a%3c said, Set on bread.%0a%3c %0a%3c 43:32 And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves,%0a%3c and for the Egyptians, which did eat with him, by themselves: because%0a%3c the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that is an%0a%3c abomination unto the Egyptians.%0a%3c %0a%3c 43:33 And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his%0a%3c birthright, and the youngest according to his youth: and the men%0a%3c marvelled one at another.%0a%3c %0a%3c 43:34 And he took and sent messes unto them from before him: but%0a%3c Benjamin's mess was five times so much as any of their's. And they%0a%3c drank, and were merry with him.%0a%3c %0a%3c 44:1 And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men's%0a%3c sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put every man's money%0a%3c in his sack's mouth.%0a%3c %0a%3c 44:2 And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of the%0a%3c youngest, and his corn money. And he did according to the word that%0a%3c Joseph had spoken.%0a%3c %0a%3c 44:3 As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they%0a%3c and their asses.%0a%3c %0a%3c 44:4 And when they were gone out of the city, and not yet far off,%0a%3c Joseph said unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and when thou%0a%3c dost overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for%0a%3c good?  44:5 Is not this it in which my lord drinketh, and whereby%0a%3c indeed he divineth? ye have done evil in so doing.%0a%3c %0a%3c 44:6 And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these same words.%0a%3c %0a%3c 44:7 And they said unto him, Wherefore saith my lord these words? God%0a%3c forbid that thy servants should do according to this thing: 44:8%0a%3c Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we brought%0a%3c again unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then should we steal%0a%3c out of thy lord's house silver or gold?  44:9 With whomsoever of thy%0a%3c servants it be found, both let him die, and we also will be my lord's%0a%3c bondmen.%0a%3c %0a%3c 44:10 And he said, Now also let it be according unto your words: he%0a%3c with whom it is found shall be my servant; and ye shall be blameless.%0a%3c %0a%3c 44:11 Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground,%0a%3c and opened every man his sack.%0a%3c %0a%3c 44:12 And he searched, and began at the eldest, and left at the%0a%3c youngest: and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack.%0a%3c %0a%3c 44:13 Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and%0a%3c returned to the city.%0a%3c %0a%3c 44:14 And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house; for he was%0a%3c yet there: and they fell before him on the ground.%0a%3c %0a%3c 44:15 And Joseph said unto them, What deed is this that ye have done?%0a%3c wot ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine?  44:16 And Judah%0a%3c said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak?  or how%0a%3c shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy%0a%3c servants: behold, we are my lord's servants, both we, and he also with%0a%3c whom the cup is found.%0a%3c %0a%3c 44:17 And he said, God forbid that I should do so: but the man in%0a%3c whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant; and as for you,%0a%3c get you up in peace unto your father.%0a%3c %0a%3c 44:18 Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh my lord, let thy%0a%3c servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not%0a%3c thine anger burn against thy servant: for thou art even as Pharaoh.%0a%3c %0a%3c 44:19 My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a%0a%3c brother?  44:20 And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old%0a%3c man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is%0a%3c dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him.%0a%3c %0a%3c 44:21 And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me, that%0a%3c I may set mine eyes upon him.%0a%3c %0a%3c 44:22 And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: for%0a%3c if he should leave his father, his father would die.%0a%3c %0a%3c 44:23 And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest brother%0a%3c come down with you, ye shall see my face no more.%0a%3c %0a%3c 44:24 And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father,%0a%3c we told him the words of my lord.%0a%3c %0a%3c 44:25 And our father said, Go again, and buy us a little food.%0a%3c %0a%3c 44:26 And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with%0a%3c us, then will we go down: for we may not see the man's face, except%0a%3c our youngest brother be with us.%0a%3c %0a%3c 44:27 And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife%0a%3c bare me two sons: 44:28 And the one went out from me, and I said,%0a%3c Surely he is torn in pieces; and I saw him not since: 44:29 And if ye%0a%3c take this also from me, and mischief befall him, ye shall bring down%0a%3c my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.%0a%3c %0a%3c 44:30 Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad%0a%3c be not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad's life;%0a%3c 44:31 It shall come to pass, when he seeth that the lad is not with%0a%3c us, that he will die: and thy servants shall bring down the gray hairs%0a%3c of thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave.%0a%3c %0a%3c 44:32 For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father,%0a%3c saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then I shall bear the blame to%0a%3c my father for ever.%0a%3c %0a%3c 44:33 Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of the%0a%3c lad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren.%0a%3c %0a%3c 44:34 For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad be not with me?%0a%3c lest peradventure I see the evil that shall come on my father.%0a%3c %0a%3c 45:1 Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood%0a%3c by him; and he cried, Cause every man to go out from me. And there%0a%3c stood no man with him, while Joseph made himself known unto his%0a%3c brethren.%0a%3c %0a%3c 45:2 And he wept aloud: and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh%0a%3c heard.%0a%3c %0a%3c 45:3 And Joseph said unto his brethren, I am Joseph; doth my father%0a%3c yet live? And his brethren could not answer him; for they were%0a%3c troubled at his presence.%0a%3c %0a%3c 45:4 And Joseph said unto his brethren, Come near to me, I pray you.%0a%3c And they came near. And he said, I am Joseph your brother, whom ye%0a%3c sold into Egypt.%0a%3c %0a%3c 45:5 Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that ye%0a%3c sold me hither: for God did send me before you to preserve life.%0a%3c %0a%3c 45:6 For these two years hath the famine been in the land: and yet%0a%3c there are five years, in the which there shall neither be earing nor%0a%3c harvest.%0a%3c %0a%3c 45:7 And God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the%0a%3c earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance.%0a%3c %0a%3c 45:8 So now it was not you that sent me hither, but God: and he hath%0a%3c made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and a ruler%0a%3c throughout all the land of Egypt.%0a%3c %0a%3c 45:9 Haste ye, and go up to my father, and say unto him, Thus saith%0a%3c thy son Joseph, God hath made me lord of all Egypt: come down unto me,%0a%3c tarry not: 45:10 And thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen, and thou%0a%3c shalt be near unto me, thou, and thy children, and thy children's%0a%3c children, and thy flocks, and thy herds, and all that thou hast: 45:11%0a%3c And there will I nourish thee; for yet there are five years of famine;%0a%3c lest thou, and thy household, and all that thou hast, come to poverty.%0a%3c %0a%3c 45:12 And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin,%0a%3c that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you.%0a%3c %0a%3c 45:13 And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all%0a%3c that ye have seen; and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither.%0a%3c %0a%3c 45:14 And he fell upon his brother Benjamin's neck, and wept; and%0a%3c Benjamin wept upon his neck.%0a%3c %0a%3c 45:15 Moreover he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them: and%0a%3c after that his brethren talked with him.%0a%3c %0a%3c 45:16 And the fame thereof was heard in Pharaoh's house, saying,%0a%3c Joseph's brethren are come: and it pleased Pharaoh well, and his%0a%3c servants.%0a%3c %0a%3c 45:17 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Say unto thy brethren, This do ye;%0a%3c lade your beasts, and go, get you unto the land of Canaan; 45:18 And%0a%3c take your father and your households, and come unto me: and I will%0a%3c give you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat of%0a%3c the land.%0a%3c %0a%3c 45:19 Now thou art commanded, this do ye; take you wagons out of the%0a%3c land of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your%0a%3c father, and come.%0a%3c %0a%3c 45:20 Also regard not your stuff; for the good of all the land of%0a%3c Egypt is your's.%0a%3c %0a%3c 45:21 And the children of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them wagons,%0a%3c according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for%0a%3c the way.%0a%3c %0a%3c 45:22 To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment; but to%0a%3c Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver, and five changes of%0a%3c raiment.%0a%3c %0a%3c 45:23 And to his father he sent after this manner; ten asses laden%0a%3c with the good things of Egypt, and ten she asses laden with corn and%0a%3c bread and meat for his father by the way.%0a%3c %0a%3c 45:24 So he sent his brethren away, and they departed: and he said%0a%3c unto them, See that ye fall not out by the way.%0a%3c %0a%3c 45:25 And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan%0a%3c unto Jacob their father, 45:26 And told him, saying, Joseph is yet%0a%3c alive, and he is governor over all the land of Egypt. And Jacob's%0a%3c heart fainted, for he believed them not.%0a%3c %0a%3c 45:27 And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said%0a%3c unto them: and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry%0a%3c him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived: 45:28 And Israel said,%0a%3c It is enough; Joseph my son is yet alive: I will go and see him before%0a%3c I die.%0a%3c %0a%3c 46:1 And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to%0a%3c Beersheba, and offered sacrifices unto the God of his father Isaac.%0a%3c %0a%3c 46:2 And God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night, and said,%0a%3c Jacob, Jacob. And he said, Here am I.%0a%3c %0a%3c 46:3 And he said, I am God, the God of thy father: fear not to go down%0a%3c into Egypt; for I will there make of thee a great nation: 46:4 I will%0a%3c go down with thee into Egypt; and I will also surely bring thee up%0a%3c again: and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes.%0a%3c %0a%3c 46:5 And Jacob rose up from Beersheba: and the sons of Israel carried%0a%3c Jacob their father, and their little ones, and their wives, in the%0a%3c wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him.%0a%3c %0a%3c 46:6 And they took their cattle, and their goods, which they had%0a%3c gotten in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob, and all his%0a%3c seed with him: 46:7 His sons, and his sons' sons with him, his%0a%3c daughters, and his sons' daughters, and all his seed brought he with%0a%3c him into Egypt.%0a%3c %0a%3c 46:8 And these are the names of the children of Israel, which came%0a%3c into Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben, Jacob's firstborn.%0a%3c %0a%3c 46:9 And the sons of Reuben; Hanoch, and Phallu, and Hezron, and%0a%3c Carmi.%0a%3c %0a%3c 46:10 And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin,%0a%3c and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman.%0a%3c %0a%3c 46:11 And the sons of Levi; Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.%0a%3c %0a%3c 46:12 And the sons of Judah; Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Pharez, and%0a%3c Zarah: but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. And the sons of%0a%3c Pharez were Hezron and Hamul.%0a%3c %0a%3c 46:13 And the sons of Issachar; Tola, and Phuvah, and Job, and%0a%3c Shimron.%0a%3c %0a%3c 46:14 And the sons of Zebulun; Sered, and Elon, and Jahleel.%0a%3c %0a%3c 46:15 These be the sons of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob in%0a%3c Padanaram, with his daughter Dinah: all the souls of his sons and his%0a%3c daughters were thirty and three.%0a%3c %0a%3c 46:16 And the sons of Gad; Ziphion, and Haggi, Shuni, and Ezbon, Eri,%0a%3c and Arodi, and Areli.%0a%3c %0a%3c 46:17 And the sons of Asher; Jimnah, and Ishuah, and Isui, and Beriah,%0a%3c and Serah their sister: and the sons of Beriah; Heber, and Malchiel.%0a%3c %0a%3c 46:18 These are the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah his%0a%3c daughter, and these she bare unto Jacob, even sixteen souls.%0a%3c %0a%3c 46:19 The sons of Rachel Jacob's wife; Joseph, and Benjamin.%0a%3c %0a%3c 46:20 And unto Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and%0a%3c Ephraim, which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On bare%0a%3c unto him.%0a%3c %0a%3c 46:21 And the sons of Benjamin were Belah, and Becher, and Ashbel,%0a%3c Gera, and Naaman, Ehi, and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard.%0a%3c %0a%3c 46:22 These are the sons of Rachel, which were born to Jacob: all the%0a%3c souls were fourteen.%0a%3c %0a%3c 46:23 And the sons of Dan; Hushim.%0a%3c %0a%3c 46:24 And the sons of Naphtali; Jahzeel, and Guni, and Jezer, and%0a%3c Shillem.%0a%3c %0a%3c 46:25 These are the sons of Bilhah, which Laban gave unto Rachel his%0a%3c daughter, and she bare these unto Jacob: all the souls were seven.%0a%3c %0a%3c 46:26 All the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt, which came out of%0a%3c his loins, besides Jacob's sons' wives, all the souls were threescore%0a%3c and six; 46:27 And the sons of Joseph, which were born him in Egypt,%0a%3c were two souls: all the souls of the house of Jacob, which came into%0a%3c Egypt, were threescore and ten.%0a%3c %0a%3c 46:28 And he sent Judah before him unto Joseph, to direct his face%0a%3c unto Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen.%0a%3c %0a%3c 46:29 And Joseph made ready his chariot, and went up to meet Israel%0a%3c his father, to Goshen, and presented himself unto him; and he fell on%0a%3c his neck, and wept on his neck a good while.%0a%3c %0a%3c 46:30 And Israel said unto Joseph, Now let me die, since I have seen%0a%3c thy face, because thou art yet alive.%0a%3c %0a%3c 46:31 And Joseph said unto his brethren, and unto his father's house,%0a%3c I will go up, and shew Pharaoh, and say unto him, My brethren, and my%0a%3c father's house, which were in the land of Canaan, are come unto me;%0a%3c 46:32 And the men are shepherds, for their trade hath been to feed%0a%3c cattle; and they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and all%0a%3c that they have.%0a%3c %0a%3c 46:33 And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh shall call you, and%0a%3c shall say, What is your occupation?  46:34 That ye shall say, Thy%0a%3c servants' trade hath been about cattle from our youth even until now,%0a%3c both we, and also our fathers: that ye may dwell in the land of%0a%3c Goshen; for every shepherd is an abomination unto the Egyptians.%0a%3c %0a%3c 47:1 Then Joseph came and told Pharaoh, and said, My father and my%0a%3c brethren, and their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have,%0a%3c are come out of the land of Canaan; and, behold, they are in the land%0a%3c of Goshen.%0a%3c %0a%3c 47:2 And he took some of his brethren, even five men, and presented%0a%3c them unto Pharaoh.%0a%3c %0a%3c 47:3 And Pharaoh said unto his brethren, What is your occupation? And%0a%3c they said unto Pharaoh, Thy servants are shepherds, both we, and also%0a%3c our fathers.%0a%3c %0a%3c 47:4 They said morever unto Pharaoh, For to sojourn in the land are we%0a%3c come; for thy servants have no pasture for their flocks; for the%0a%3c famine is sore in the land of Canaan: now therefore, we pray thee, let%0a%3c thy servants dwell in the land of Goshen.%0a%3c %0a%3c 47:5 And Pharaoh spake unto Joseph, saying, Thy father and thy%0a%3c brethren are come unto thee: 47:6 The land of Egypt is before thee; in%0a%3c the best of the land make thy father and brethren to dwell; in the%0a%3c land of Goshen let them dwell: and if thou knowest any men of activity%0a%3c among them, then make them rulers over my cattle.%0a%3c %0a%3c 47:7 And Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and set him before%0a%3c Pharaoh: and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.%0a%3c %0a%3c 47:8 And Pharaoh said unto Jacob, How old art thou?  47:9 And Jacob%0a%3c said unto Pharaoh, The days of the years of my pilgrimage are an%0a%3c hundred and thirty years: few and evil have the days of the years of%0a%3c my life been, and have not attained unto the days of the years of the%0a%3c life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage.%0a%3c %0a%3c 47:10 And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from before Pharaoh.%0a%3c %0a%3c 47:11 And Joseph placed his father and his brethren, and gave them a%0a%3c possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land%0a%3c of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.%0a%3c %0a%3c 47:12 And Joseph nourished his father, and his brethren, and all his%0a%3c father's household, with bread, according to their families.%0a%3c %0a%3c 47:13 And there was no bread in all the land; for the famine was very%0a%3c sore, so that the land of Egypt and all the land of Canaan fainted by%0a%3c reason of the famine.%0a%3c %0a%3c 47:14 And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land%0a%3c of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the corn which they bought:%0a%3c and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house.%0a%3c %0a%3c 47:15 And when money failed in the land of Egypt, and in the land of%0a%3c Canaan, all the Egyptians came unto Joseph, and said, Give us bread:%0a%3c for why should we die in thy presence? for the money faileth.%0a%3c %0a%3c 47:16 And Joseph said, Give your cattle; and I will give you for your%0a%3c cattle, if money fail.%0a%3c %0a%3c 47:17 And they brought their cattle unto Joseph: and Joseph gave them%0a%3c bread in exchange for horses, and for the flocks, and for the cattle%0a%3c of the herds, and for the asses: and he fed them with bread for all%0a%3c their cattle for that year.%0a%3c %0a%3c 47:18 When that year was ended, they came unto him the second year,%0a%3c and said unto him, We will not hide it from my lord, how that our%0a%3c money is spent; my lord also hath our herds of cattle; there is not%0a%3c ought left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies, and our lands:%0a%3c 47:19 Wherefore shall we die before thine eyes, both we and our land?%0a%3c buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants%0a%3c unto Pharaoh: and give us seed, that we may live, and not die, that%0a%3c the land be not desolate.%0a%3c %0a%3c 47:20 And Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the%0a%3c Egyptians sold every man his field, because the famine prevailed over%0a%3c them: so the land became Pharaoh's.%0a%3c %0a%3c 47:21 And as for the people, he removed them to cities from one end of%0a%3c the borders of Egypt even to the other end thereof.%0a%3c %0a%3c 47:22 Only the land of the priests bought he not; for the priests had%0a%3c a portion assigned them of Pharaoh, and did eat their portion which%0a%3c Pharaoh gave them: wherefore they sold not their lands.%0a%3c %0a%3c 47:23 Then Joseph said unto the people, Behold, I have bought you this%0a%3c day and your land for Pharaoh: lo, here is seed for you, and ye shall%0a%3c sow the land.%0a%3c %0a%3c 47:24 And it shall come to pass in the increase, that ye shall give%0a%3c the fifth part unto Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own, for%0a%3c seed of the field, and for your food, and for them of your households,%0a%3c and for food for your little ones.%0a%3c %0a%3c 47:25 And they said, Thou hast saved our lives: let us find grace in%0a%3c the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh's servants.%0a%3c %0a%3c 47:26 And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt unto this day,%0a%3c that Pharaoh should have the fifth part, except the land of the%0a%3c priests only, which became not Pharaoh's.%0a%3c %0a%3c 47:27 And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the country of Goshen;%0a%3c and they had possessions therein, and grew, and multiplied%0a%3c exceedingly.%0a%3c %0a%3c 47:28 And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years: so the%0a%3c whole age of Jacob was an hundred forty and seven years.%0a%3c %0a%3c 47:29 And the time drew nigh that Israel must die: and he called his%0a%3c son Joseph, and said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight,%0a%3c put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly%0a%3c with me; bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt: 47:30 But I will lie with%0a%3c my fathers, and thou shalt carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their%0a%3c buryingplace. And he said, I will do as thou hast said.%0a%3c %0a%3c 47:31 And he said, Swear unto me. And he sware unto him. And Israel%0a%3c bowed himself upon the bed's head.%0a%3c %0a%3c 48:1 And it came to pass after these things, that one told Joseph,%0a%3c Behold, thy father is sick: and he took with him his two sons,%0a%3c Manasseh and Ephraim.%0a%3c %0a%3c 48:2 And one told Jacob, and said, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh unto%0a%3c thee: and Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed.%0a%3c %0a%3c 48:3 And Jacob said unto Joseph, God Almighty appeared unto me at Luz%0a%3c in the land of Canaan, and blessed me, 48:4 And said unto me, Behold,%0a%3c I will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I will make of thee%0a%3c a multitude of people; and will give this land to thy seed after thee%0a%3c for an everlasting possession.%0a%3c %0a%3c 48:5 And now thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, which were born unto%0a%3c thee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into Egypt, are%0a%3c mine; as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine.%0a%3c %0a%3c 48:6 And thy issue, which thou begettest after them, shall be thine,%0a%3c and shall be called after the name of their brethren in their%0a%3c inheritance.%0a%3c %0a%3c 48:7 And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in the%0a%3c land of Canaan in the way, when yet there was but a little way to come%0a%3c unto Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath; the same%0a%3c is Bethlehem.%0a%3c %0a%3c 48:8 And Israel beheld Joseph's sons, and said, Who are these?  48:9%0a%3c And Joseph said unto his father, They are my sons, whom God hath given%0a%3c me in this place. And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, unto me, and I%0a%3c will bless them.%0a%3c %0a%3c 48:10 Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not%0a%3c see.%0a%3c %0a%3c And he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them, and embraced%0a%3c them.%0a%3c %0a%3c 48:11 And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face:%0a%3c and, lo, God hath shewed me also thy seed.%0a%3c %0a%3c 48:12 And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed%0a%3c himself with his face to the earth.%0a%3c %0a%3c 48:13 And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward%0a%3c Israel's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel's%0a%3c right hand, and brought them near unto him.%0a%3c %0a%3c 48:14 And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon%0a%3c Ephraim's head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh's%0a%3c head, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh was the firstborn.%0a%3c %0a%3c 48:15 And he blessed Joseph, and said, God, before whom my fathers%0a%3c Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God which fed me all my life long unto%0a%3c this day, 48:16 The Angel which redeemed me from all evil, bless the%0a%3c lads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers%0a%3c Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of%0a%3c the earth.%0a%3c %0a%3c 48:17 And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the%0a%3c head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up his father's hand,%0a%3c to remove it from Ephraim's head unto Manasseh's head.%0a%3c %0a%3c 48:18 And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father: for this is%0a%3c the firstborn; put thy right hand upon his head.%0a%3c %0a%3c 48:19 And his father refused, and said, I know it, my son, I know it:%0a%3c he also shall become a people, and he also shall be great: but truly%0a%3c his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall%0a%3c become a multitude of nations.%0a%3c %0a%3c 48:20 And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee shall Israel%0a%3c bless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh: and he set%0a%3c Ephraim before Manasseh.%0a%3c %0a%3c 48:21 And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die: but God shall be%0a%3c with you, and bring you again unto the land of your fathers.%0a%3c %0a%3c 48:22 Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren,%0a%3c which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my%0a%3c bow.%0a%3c %0a%3c 49:1 And Jacob called unto his sons, and said, Gather yourselves%0a%3c together, that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the last%0a%3c days.%0a%3c %0a%3c 49:2 Gather yourselves together, and hear, ye sons of Jacob; and%0a%3c hearken unto Israel your father.%0a%3c %0a%3c 49:3 Reuben, thou art my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of my%0a%3c strength, the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power: 49:4%0a%3c Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel; because thou wentest up to%0a%3c thy father's bed; then defiledst thou it: he went up to my couch.%0a%3c %0a%3c 49:5 Simeon and Levi are brethren; instruments of cruelty are in their%0a%3c habitations.%0a%3c %0a%3c 49:6 O my soul, come not thou into their secret; unto their assembly,%0a%3c mine honour, be not thou united: for in their anger they slew a man,%0a%3c and in their selfwill they digged down a wall.%0a%3c %0a%3c 49:7 Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; and their wrath, for it%0a%3c was cruel: I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel.%0a%3c %0a%3c 49:8 Judah, thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise: thy hand shall%0a%3c be in the neck of thine enemies; thy father's children shall bow down%0a%3c before thee.%0a%3c %0a%3c 49:9 Judah is a lion's whelp: from the prey, my son, thou art gone up:%0a%3c he stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion; who shall%0a%3c rouse him up?  49:10 The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a%0a%3c lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him shall%0a%3c the gathering of the people be.%0a%3c %0a%3c 49:11 Binding his foal unto the vine, and his ass's colt unto the%0a%3c choice vine; he washed his garments in wine, and his clothes in the%0a%3c blood of grapes: 49:12 His eyes shall be red with wine, and his teeth%0a%3c white with milk.%0a%3c %0a%3c 49:13 Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea; and he shall be for%0a%3c an haven of ships; and his border shall be unto Zidon.%0a%3c %0a%3c 49:14 Issachar is a strong ass couching down between two burdens:%0a%3c 49:15 And he saw that rest was good, and the land that it was%0a%3c pleasant; and bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a servant unto%0a%3c tribute.%0a%3c %0a%3c 49:16 Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel.%0a%3c %0a%3c 49:17 Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder in the path, that%0a%3c biteth the horse heels, so that his rider shall fall backward.%0a%3c %0a%3c 49:18 I have waited for thy salvation, O LORD.%0a%3c %0a%3c 49:19 Gad, a troop shall overcome him: but he shall overcome at the%0a%3c last.%0a%3c %0a%3c 49:20 Out of Asher his bread shall be fat, and he shall yield royal%0a%3c dainties.%0a%3c %0a%3c 49:21 Naphtali is a hind let loose: he giveth goodly words.%0a%3c %0a%3c 49:22 Joseph is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a well;%0a%3c whose branches run over the wall: 49:23 The archers have sorely%0a%3c grieved him, and shot at him, and hated him: 49:24 But his bow abode%0a%3c in strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands%0a%3c of the mighty God of Jacob; (from thence is the shepherd, the stone of%0a%3c Israel:) 49:25 Even by the God of thy father, who shall help thee; and%0a%3c by the Almighty, who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above,%0a%3c blessings of the deep that lieth under, blessings of the breasts, and%0a%3c of the womb: 49:26 The blessings of thy father have prevailed above%0a%3c the blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the%0a%3c everlasting hills: they shall be on the head of Joseph, and on the%0a%3c crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren.%0a%3c %0a%3c 49:27 Benjamin shall ravin as a wolf: in the morning he shall devour%0a%3c the prey, and at night he shall divide the spoil.%0a%3c %0a%3c 49:28 All these are the twelve tribes of Israel: and this is it that%0a%3c their father spake unto them, and blessed them; every one according to%0a%3c his blessing he blessed them.%0a%3c %0a%3c 49:29 And he charged them, and said unto them, I am to be gathered%0a%3c unto my people: bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the%0a%3c field of Ephron the Hittite, 49:30 In the cave that is in the field of%0a%3c Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham%0a%3c bought with the field of Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a%0a%3c buryingplace.%0a%3c %0a%3c 49:31 There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried%0a%3c Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah.%0a%3c %0a%3c 49:32 The purchase of the field and of the cave that is therein was%0a%3c from the children of Heth.%0a%3c %0a%3c 49:33 And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, he%0a%3c gathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost, and was%0a%3c gathered unto his people.%0a%3c %0a%3c 50:1 And Joseph fell upon his father's face, and wept upon him, and%0a%3c kissed him.%0a%3c %0a%3c 50:2 And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his%0a%3c father: and the physicians embalmed Israel.%0a%3c %0a%3c 50:3 And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled the%0a%3c days of those which are embalmed: and the Egyptians mourned for him%0a%3c threescore and ten days.%0a%3c %0a%3c 50:4 And when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spake unto%0a%3c the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found grace in your eyes,%0a%3c speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying, 50:5 My father made%0a%3c me swear, saying, Lo, I die: in my grave which I have digged for me in%0a%3c the land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me. Now therefore let me go%0a%3c up, I pray thee, and bury my father, and I will come again.%0a%3c %0a%3c 50:6 And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as he%0a%3c made thee swear.%0a%3c %0a%3c 50:7 And Joseph went up to bury his father: and with him went up all%0a%3c the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders%0a%3c of the land of Egypt, 50:8 And all the house of Joseph, and his%0a%3c brethren, and his father's house: only their little ones, and their%0a%3c flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen.%0a%3c %0a%3c 50:9 And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was%0a%3c a very great company.%0a%3c %0a%3c 50:10 And they came to the threshingfloor of Atad, which is beyond%0a%3c Jordan, and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation:%0a%3c and he made a mourning for his father seven days.%0a%3c %0a%3c 50:11 And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the%0a%3c mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This is a grievous mourning%0a%3c to the Egyptians: wherefore the name of it was called Abelmizraim,%0a%3c which is beyond Jordan.%0a%3c %0a%3c 50:12 And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them: 50:13%0a%3c For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in%0a%3c the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the%0a%3c field for a possession of a buryingplace of Ephron the Hittite, before%0a%3c Mamre.%0a%3c %0a%3c 50:14 And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brethren, and all%0a%3c that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his%0a%3c father.%0a%3c %0a%3c 50:15 And when Joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead, they%0a%3c said, Joseph will peradventure hate us, and will certainly requite us%0a%3c all the evil which we did unto him.%0a%3c %0a%3c 50:16 And they sent a messenger unto Joseph, saying, Thy father did%0a%3c command before he died, saying, 50:17 So shall ye say unto Joseph,%0a%3c Forgive, I pray thee now, the trespass of thy brethren, and their sin;%0a%3c for they did unto thee evil: and now, we pray thee, forgive the%0a%3c trespass of the servants of the God of thy father. And Joseph wept%0a%3c when they spake unto him.%0a%3c %0a%3c 50:18 And his brethren also went and fell down before his face; and%0a%3c they said, Behold, we be thy servants.%0a%3c %0a%3c 50:19 And Joseph said unto them, Fear not: for am I in the place of%0a%3c God?  50:20 But as for you, ye thought evil against me; but God meant%0a%3c it unto good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people%0a%3c alive.%0a%3c %0a%3c 50:21 Now therefore fear ye not: I will nourish you, and your little%0a%3c ones.%0a%3c %0a%3c And he comforted them, and spake kindly unto them.%0a%3c %0a%3c 50:22 And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father's house: and%0a%3c Joseph lived an hundred and ten years.%0a%3c %0a%3c 50:23 And Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third generation: the%0a%3c children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were brought up upon%0a%3c Joseph's knees.%0a%3c %0a%3c 50:24 And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die: and God will surely%0a%3c visit you, and bring you out of this land unto the land which he sware%0a%3c to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.%0a%3c %0a%3c 50:25 And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God%0a%3c will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence.%0a%3c %0a%3c 50:26 So Joseph died, being an hundred and ten years old: and they%0a%3c embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.%0a\ No newline at end of file%0a
