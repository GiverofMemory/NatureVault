text=The Lock and the Key %0a%0a%0a%0a41. Rabbi Chiya and Rabbi Yosi were walking along a road. As they reached a %0afield, Rabbi Chiya said to Rabbi Yosi, "The words BARAH SHEET (created %0asix) certainly allude to BERESHEET, for the six Supernal Days, VAKde Bina, %0ashine on the Torah (ZA), while the others, QAR de Bina, are concealed." %0a%0aZA of the world of Atzilut is called the Torah. The six Supernal Days are VAK %0ade Bina that are above ZA. Hence, the first word of the Torah, BERESHEET = %0aBARAH (created) and SHEET (six) indicates that the Sefira Bina turns to the %0aSefira Hochma in order to receive Ohr Hochma and pass it to ZA. Since ZA is %0aunable to receive all the Ohr Hochma (GAR de Hochma, the Light of the ten %0aSefirot) from Bina, but only VAK de Hochma (Light of six Sefirot), this is stressed %0ain the word BARAH SHEET-CREATED SIX. This means that ZA receives %0afrom Bina the Light of only six Sefirot, HGT NHY or VAK de Hochma, whereas %0aGAR de Hochma, the Light of Sefirot KHB, is concealed from him. %0a%0aThe reason for this is that although Partzuf Atik belongs to Tzimtzum Aleph %0a(the first restriction), it is obliged to shine down on all the other Partzufim of %0athe world of Atzilut, and on all the worlds BYA with the Light of Tzimtzum Bet. %0aTherefore, with regards to the lower Partzufim, it appears as a Partzuf that belongs %0ato Tzimtzum Bet. %0a%0aIn other words, it deliberately imposed on itself an outward (with regards to %0aothers) restriction of its Light, to enable the lower Partzufim to receive from it. %0aHence, it elevated Malchut from the Peh to the Eynaim and made a Zivug on the %0ascreen that stands in Nikvey Eynaim, thus begetting Partzuf AA. %0a%0aThis is why AA is a Partzuf with properties of the second restriction, and %0aacts as Keter of the entire world of Atzilut instead of Atik. This was designed %0aso by Partzuf Atik itself, which split into two parts: GE remained in Atik, and %0aAHP became part of the second Partzuf, AA. And since Malchut ascended to NE %0a%0a181 %0a%0a%0a%0a182 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0a(Nikvey Eynaim), Partzuf AA remained without Malchut, the Sefira Ateret Yesod %0awas used in its stead, and Malchut became concealed in the NE of Partzuf Atik. %0aAlso, GE de Atik became concealed from the lower Partzufim, Malchut stood in %0aNE of Rosh de Atik, AHP de Atik became GE de AA, and Ateret Yesod became %0aMalchut de AA. %0a%0aAll the subsequent Partzufim of the world of At^ilut emerged similar to %0athese Partzufim. Thus, they all split into two parts, GE and AHP: Partzuf Bina %0awas split into two Partzufim: GE de Bina formed Partzuf AVI and AHP de Bina %0aformed Partzuf YESHSLT. Malchut ascended and remained in AVI, while Partzuf %0aYESHSUT remained without Malchut. %0a%0aThe same applies to ZON: GE formed the big ZON and AHP formed the %0asmall ZON. Malchut remained in NE of the big ZON, while the small ZON have %0aonly nine Se/irot without Malchut, which is replaced in them by Ateret Yesod, as in %0aPartzuf Atik. Therefore, just as Keter (Atik) split into two parts: GAR = Atik and %0aZAT = AA, so was Bina divided into GAR = AVI and ZAT = YESHSUT, and ZON %0ainto GAR = the big ZON and ZAT = the small ZON Malchut remained in GAR %0aand Ateret Yesod replaced it in ZAT. %0a%0aAs a result, the Upper Part of each degree remains concealed, just like Partzuf %0aAtik, for Malchut does not descend from the place where she had ascended (NE) %0ato her previous place in the Peh. And although in Gadlut, AHP return to their %0aplace or ascend to their own GE (which is one and the same), GE do not become %0afilled with Ohr Hochma (the Light of GAR) as a result, since Malchut remains %0aconcealed in GE. Moreover, Malchut exists under the ban of T^imt^um Aleph on %0athe reception of Ohr Hochma. Hence, GE remain with Ohr Hassadim. %0a%0aOnly the lower part of each degree is filled with the Light of GAR (Hochma) %0ain Gadlut: there was Avir (air) = Aleph-Vav-Yod-Reish, then the letter Yod departed %0afrom this word, and only the letters Ale£>h-Vat/-Reish remained to form the word %0aOhr (Light)-Ohr Hochma or GAR. %0a%0aIt follows that all Partzufim of the world of At^ilut have GE, GAR of Kelim, %0aSefirot KHB HGT with Ohr Hassadim, the Light of VAK, whereas AHP, Sefirot %0aNHY, Vak de Kelim in the Gadlut of the Partzuf are filled with Ohr Hochma, %0athe Light of GAR. GE (GAR de Kelim) are filled with the Light of VAK (Ohr %0aHassadim), and AHP (VAK de Kelim) are filled with the Light of GAR (Ohr %0aHochma). It is therefore said that there's no greater Light for ZA in the world %0aof Atzilut than the Light of VAK = six days, while GAR are concealed even in %0athe Partzufim above ZA. %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Lock and the Key %0a%0a%0a%0a183 %0a%0a%0a%0a42. However, it is said in the secrets of creation of BERESHEET that He %0awho is Holy and Concealed established the laws in Bina, in the secret and %0aconcealed, meaning Mcdchut of Partzuf Atik, which is a Partzuf with Mcdchut %0aof Tzimtzum Aleph, who ascended to Bina and removed AHP de AA below %0aits Rosh. And the same law that He established in Bina He established and %0aconcealed within, and everything is locked under one key. And He hid this key %0ain a hall. And although everything is hidden in that hall, the most important %0athing is in that key, for it locks and unlocks everything. %0a%0aHE WHO IS HOLY AND CONCEALED is AA, for its Hochma is concealed. %0aTHE LAWS ARE ESTABLISHED IN IT, meaning in Malchut de Atik. The %0adeficiency of the Kelim de AHP is confirmed. Malchut of Tzimtzum Aleph, called %0a"the central point of all creation," is also the sole creation on which Tzimtzum %0aAleph was imposed. Contrary to her, if the screen stands not in Malchut, but in %0aYesod or, more precisely, in Ateret Yesod, the place of the covenant (circumcision), %0athe place of the Zivug that was permitted after Tzimtzum Bet, this screen allows %0afor the reception of Light. Hence, it is called the "point of population," and not %0athe "central point." %0a%0a- Keter %0a%0a- Hochma %0a%0a- Bina %0a%0a- ZA Yesod %0a%0a- ZA— Malchut that received ZA's properties to "bestow," the popu- %0a%0alated place %0a%0a- Malchut— no Zivug can be made; the deserted place %0a%0aThe thing is that there is no GAR in AA, for the Supernal Malchut of Atik, %0awithin AA, is already corrected to the point of being in NE of her own Partzuf. %0aIn Gacllut, the screen descends from NE to Peh, which makes AHP return to %0atheir place, and a Zivug transpires on all ten Sefirot, which receive the GAR of %0athe Light, Ohr Hochma. %0a%0aTherefore, the screen in NE is called a "lock," for it blocks the entry of GAR %0aof the Light into the Partzuf. The GAR of the Light are called Ohr Hochma. Yet, %0aby descending from NE to Peh, the screen lets the Light into the Partzuf, and is %0atherefore called Nikvey Eynaim (pupils of the eyes). %0a%0aAlthough Atik itself is in NE together with Malchut, it affects AA, and not %0aAtik itself, as AA was created by the screen, located not in Malchut, but in Ateret %0aYesod (or simply in Yesod), and there is no Malchut in it. This is why it is not %0a%0a%0a%0a184 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aMalchut that rules in NE de AA, but Ateret Yesod. And this is why, unlike the %0aLight of Atik, its Light can be attained, for Malchut in Atik is the central point, %0awhich does not make a Zivug on Ohr Hochma. Although with regards to Atik, AA %0ais AHP of Atik, AA itself has its own GE and AHP. %0a%0aSubsequently, AA created AVI and confirmed the absence of Ohr Hochma in %0athem, due to the absence of AHP de Kelim. These AHP are the HALL in which %0athe entire Light of Hochma is concealed (GAR de Neshama, GAR de Haya, and %0aGAR de Yechida). This KEY IS KEPT HIDDEN IN A HALL Bina is a hall for %0aOhr Hochma. Malchut ascends to GAR de Bina (AVI) and rules there, but the %0aabsence of Ohr Hochma is not felt there, for the properties of AVI want only Ohr %0aHassadim; this is what is important to them, as it completely substitutes the Ohr %0aHochma. And VAK de Bina is ruled by the key, Ateret Yesod. %0a%0aIN THAT KEY, FOR IT LOCKS AND UNLOCKS EVERYTHING— %0aconcealments and revelations are made by Malchut that stands in NE: when %0aMalchut ascends to NE she conceals Ohr Hochma, since in such a case, the Partzuf %0aremains without its Kelim of AHP— it cannot use its desires to "receive" for the %0aCreator's sake. Consequently, it contains no Ohr Hochma, for Ohr Hochma can %0aonly be received in Kelim de AHP. %0a%0aAnd when a Partzuf receives strength from Above to resist the egoistic %0adesires of reception of its Kelim de AHP, and can receive for the Creator's sake, %0athis means that it has acquired a screen against its desires, and can also work %0awith them for the Creator. It then brings its Malchut back from the NE to the %0aPeh. Put differently, it elevates its Kelim (desires of AHP) to the Rosh and begins %0ato calculate how much Light it can receive within them for the Creator's sake. %0aHowever, the received pleasure must not be too great, or it will make the Partzuf %0aenjoy it egoistically. Afterwards, the Partzuf receives Ohr Hochma in its Guf. %0a%0aThus, only Malchut that stands in NE allows or forbids the Light from %0aentering the Partzuf. And since she must let the Light into the Partzuf in ZAT %0a(where the rule belongs not to Malchut that ascended to NE, but to Ateret Yesod, %0acalled "key"), whereas the GAR of each Partzuf remain with Ohr Hassadim (they %0adesire only the Light of Hassadim), letting the Light in or preventing it from %0aentering the Partzuf depends only on the key, and not on Malchut herself. %0a%0a43. That hall conceals tremendous treasures piled one upon the other. And %0athere are fifty tightly closed gates in that hall, which are meant to block %0aaccess to the Light. They were divided into four sides and became forty-nine %0agates, for one gate has no side, and it is unknown whether it exists above or %0abelow. Hence, it remained closed. %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Lock and the Key %0a%0a%0a%0a185 %0a%0a%0a%0aThere are many types of GAR: GAR of Ohr Neshama, Haya, or Yechida. Each %0aof them contains countless individual degrees and details. Hence, it is written, %0aONE UPON THE OTHER. Yet, as long as Malchut stands in NE, all these %0adegrees of Light remain concealed and unknown. %0a%0aA gate signifies a vessel— a desire to receive the Light. In the spiritual world, %0athere are no bodies, only desires. The desire itself is called "a body." If there is no %0adesire, there is no body, as there is no vessel to receive the Light (pleasure). The %0abigger the desire, the "bigger" the body. However, all the bodies are similar in %0astructure; just as a human body in our world consists of 613 parts, the spiritual %0abody consists of 613 spiritual parts (desires). %0a%0aIf one is able to use one of the desires of his spiritual body for the Creator's %0asake, such action is referred to as a Mitzva (commandment, good deed). The %0areceived Light is called "Torah." %0a%0aA spiritual Partzuf has a Rosh (head), the place where decisions are made. %0aIt contains only those desires that are known to be fit with a screen (resistance %0ato the desires) to use them spiritually, altruistically, and to "reverse" them from %0a"for one's own sake" to "for the sake of the Creator." If one has fulfilled all 613 %0acommandments of the Torah and the seven Mitzvot (plural for Mitzva) of the %0anations of the world (620 Mitzvot in all), he thereby ascends 620 degrees and %0acompletely merges with the Creator. %0a%0aTo observe all the commandments means to completely fill one's spiritual %0aPartzuf with the Light of the Torah by fulfilling observant commandments %0a(Mitzvot Aseh— positive Mitzvot) and prohibitory commandments (Mitzvot Lo %0aTaaseh— negative Mitzvot). The fulfillment of the later lies in the unwillingness to %0areceive the pleasure that is found within them. %0a%0aThere are two types of desires or gates: when they are closed and receive %0anothing, and when they open and receive the Upper Light. When they are %0aall closed, there are fifty of them. However, only forty-nine of the fifty can be %0aopened. There are ten Sefirot KHB HGT NHYM or five Sefirot KHB ZA-M (as ZA %0aconsists of six Sefirot HGT NHY). However, Malchut also consists of these six, %0aand hence includes all ten Sefirot. And since each of the five Sefirot consists of %0aten, in all they make up fifty. %0a%0aHowever, since a Zivug is made not on Malchut, but on Ateret Yesod, Malchut %0ade Malchut itself does not receive the Light. Instead, Light is received by the four %0aSefirot KHB ZA that precede Malchut. Each of them consists of ten, hence 4 x 10 = %0a40 plus nine Sefirot from Keter to Yesod in Malchut herself yields 40 + 9 = 49. %0a%0a%0a%0a186 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aOnly one Sefira (Malchut de Malchut) out of the fifty does not receive the %0aLight. This is because until all the Kelim (desires) have been completely corrected, %0athe Light cannot enter it, as it is known in advance that Malchut de Malchut has %0ano strength to oppose such a powerful egoistic desire to receive pleasure. %0a%0aInstead of being in Malchut de Malchut, the screen stands in Yesod de %0aMalchut, and this place is called Brith (Covenant), the place where the Mitzva of %0acircumcision must be kept, so as to make a Zivug not on Malchut herself (on the %0afirst restriction), but on Yesod, or rather, Ateret Yesod (on the second restriction). %0aMalchut de Malchut itself is called "Shaar Nun" (the 50 th gate). This refers to %0aMalchut of each Partzuf in the worlds ABYA. %0a%0aAnd although Malchut of Partzuf AVI descends from NE de AVI to her place %0ain Peh, while AHP and YESHSUT that clothe them ascend to the degree of %0aAVI, and AVI merges with YESHSUT into one Partzuf, as a result of which, %0aOhr Hochma descends to them from AA, AVI are unwilling and therefore do %0anot receive anything from Ohr Hochma, and remain only with Ohr Hassadim, as %0athough Malchut had never even descended from E^nazm to Peh. %0a%0aTherefore, it is impossible to tell by the Light of AVI whether Malchut is %0alocated at the NE or at the Peh. On the contrary, by looking at AVI, it always %0aseems to us that Malchut stands at NE. Only by the state of YESHSUT can we %0adetermine Malchut's location, for when she ascends to AVI in Gadlut (big state), %0aYESHSUT receive Ohr Hochma. %0a%0aAlthough Malchut herself can receive Ohr Hochma in AVI, since AVI receive %0ano Ohr Hochma whatsoever, they do not utilize their own Malchut. Since %0aYESHSUT already has Ateret Yesod instead of Malchut, it receives the Light or %0a"opens up," whereas AVI remain closed. %0a%0aHowever, the absence of the 50 th gate, the Zivug on Malchut herself in %0aYESHSUT, causes the absence of the corresponding Light of Hochma in all the %0aPartzufim. It is written about it: "fifty gates of Bina, and all are given to Moshe, %0aexcept for one, the last secret of the absence of the Upper Light." For this %0aUpper Light can be received only within the Kelim (desires) of Malchut herself, %0aof primordial egoism, which will occur at the end of all the corrections, at the %0acompletion of the 6,000 years. %0a%0a44. Those gates have one lock with a narrow space inside for inserting the %0akey. It is unmarked, and recognized only by the impress of the key, which is %0aunknown in that narrow space, but only in the key itself. And it is written of %0athis secret: BERESHEET BARAH ELOKIM (IN THE BEGINNING THE %0aCREATOR CREATED). "In the beginning" is the key, and all is concealed %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Lock and the Key %0a%0a%0a%0a187 %0a%0a%0a%0awithin it, as it unlocks and locks. And six gates are contained in this key, %0awhich locks and unlocks. When it locks those gates, encloses them within %0aitself, it is written IN THE BEGINNING (BERESHEET): a revealed word, %0athough it is usually concealed. BARAH (CREATED) is a concealed word %0aeverywhere, implying that the key unlocks it and locks it up. %0a%0aMalchut that stands in NE is called a "lock," for she prevents Ohr Hochma %0afrom entering the Partzuf. The entire Partzuf ends in Hochma (the Light can only %0abe in K-H). Hence, it is merely Nefesh-Ruach. After all, in the absence of Kelim- %0aSefirot B-ZA-M, the Lights Neshama-Haya-Yechida are absent. Yesod de Malchut is %0athe 49 th gate, the maximum that can be before the end of correction, for Malchut %0ade Malchut itself is the 50 th gate. %0a%0aIf the key (Ateret Yesod of the Light) enters Yesod de Malchut (the 49 th gate), %0athen this Light lowers Malchut to her place, from NE to Peh. This Light opens %0athe Partzuf and Ohr Hochma fills it. This is why Ateret Yesod is called a "key." %0a%0aHowever, there is a special Reshimo that allows one to not use Malchut de %0aMalchut as a place of Zivug before the final correction of all the others (except %0afor Malchut de Malchut, Kelim-desires). This Reshimo is in AVI: since they never %0areceive Ohr Hochma (they do not use this key), their real AHP do not ascend. %0aNevertheless, even their false AHP is sufficient to let YESHSUT receive Ohr %0aHochma and realize that knowledge signifies the presence of Ohr Hochma. %0a%0aIf the Light that corresponds to Ateret Yesod enters the corresponding Sefira %0ain Malchut (in Yesod de Malchut, the 49 th Sefira), then Malchut (the 50 th gate) does %0anot forbid this Light to fill the Partzuf, does not "lock up" the Partzuf, as she %0acontains the Reshimo of prohibition only on that which enters Malchut herself. %0aThe reason for it is that the Reshimo (the key's memory) rules in ZAT de Bina, %0athat is, in YESHSUT. Hence, this Light is called a "key." %0a%0aAnd the word BERESHEET-IN THE BEGINNING-includes in itself only %0athe key (Ateret Yesod, the 49 th Sefira), excluding Malchut de Malchut, the 50 th gate. %0aHowever, none of the Sefirot KHB of all the Partzufim of the world of At^ilut %0areceive Ohr Hochma; Ohr Hassadim shines within them instead. %0a%0aTherefore, the words IN THE BEGINNING CREATED (BERESHEET %0aBARAH) mean CONCEALED HOCHMA, for the word BARAH (created) is %0aderived from the notion of BAR (beyond), which signifies moving Malchut de %0aMalchut beyond the reception of Ohr Hochma; hence, this part of the Kelim was %0alocked up by the absence of Light.

As they reached a %0a%3c field, Rabbi Chiya said to Rabbi Yosi, "The words BARAH SHEET (created %0a%3c six) certainly allude to BERESHEET, for the six Supernal Days, VAKde Bina, %0a%3c shine on the Torah (ZA), while the others, QAR de Bina, are concealed." %0a%3c %0a%3c ZA of the world of Atzilut is called the Torah. The six Supernal Days are VAK %0a%3c de Bina that are above ZA. Hence, the first word of the Torah, BERESHEET = %0a%3c BARAH (created) and SHEET (six) indicates that the Sefira Bina turns to the %0a%3c Sefira Hochma in order to receive Ohr Hochma and pass it to ZA. Since ZA is %0a%3c unable to receive all the Ohr Hochma (GAR de Hochma, the Light of the ten %0a%3c Sefirot) from Bina, but only VAK de Hochma (Light of six Sefirot), this is stressed %0a%3c in the word BARAH SHEET-CREATED SIX. This means that ZA receives %0a%3c from Bina the Light of only six Sefirot, HGT NHY or VAK de Hochma, whereas %0a%3c GAR de Hochma, the Light of Sefirot KHB, is concealed from him. %0a%3c %0a%3c The reason for this is that although Partzuf Atik belongs to Tzimtzum Aleph %0a%3c (the first restriction), it is obliged to shine down on all the other Partzufim of %0a%3c the world of Atzilut, and on all the worlds BYA with the Light of Tzimtzum Bet. %0a%3c Therefore, with regards to the lower Partzufim, it appears as a Partzuf that belongs %0a%3c to Tzimtzum Bet. %0a%3c %0a%3c In other words, it deliberately imposed on itself an outward (with regards to %0a%3c others) restriction of its Light, to enable the lower Partzufim to receive from it. %0a%3c Hence, it elevated Malchut from the Peh to the Eynaim and made a Zivug on the %0a%3c screen that stands in Nikvey Eynaim, thus begetting Partzuf AA. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is why AA is a Partzuf with properties of the second restriction, and %0a%3c acts as Keter of the entire world of Atzilut instead of Atik. This was designed %0a%3c so by Partzuf Atik itself, which split into two parts: GE remained in Atik, and %0a%3c AHP became part of the second Partzuf, AA. And since Malchut ascended to NE %0a%3c %0a%3c 181 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 182 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c (Nikvey Eynaim), Partzuf AA remained without Malchut, the Sefira Ateret Yesod %0a%3c was used in its stead, and Malchut became concealed in the NE of Partzuf Atik. %0a%3c Also, GE de Atik became concealed from the lower Partzufim, Malchut stood in %0a%3c NE of Rosh de Atik, AHP de Atik became GE de AA, and Ateret Yesod became %0a%3c Malchut de AA. %0a%3c %0a%3c All the subsequent Partzufim of the world of At^ilut emerged similar to %0a%3c these Partzufim. Thus, they all split into two parts, GE and AHP: Partzuf Bina %0a%3c was split into two Partzufim: GE de Bina formed Partzuf AVI and AHP de Bina %0a%3c formed Partzuf YESHSLT. Malchut ascended and remained in AVI, while Partzuf %0a%3c YESHSUT remained without Malchut. %0a%3c %0a%3c The same applies to ZON: GE formed the big ZON and AHP formed the %0a%3c small ZON. Malchut remained in NE of the big ZON, while the small ZON have %0a%3c only nine Se/irot without Malchut, which is replaced in them by Ateret Yesod, as in %0a%3c Partzuf Atik. Therefore, just as Keter (Atik) split into two parts: GAR = Atik and %0a%3c ZAT = AA, so was Bina divided into GAR = AVI and ZAT = YESHSUT, and ZON %0a%3c into GAR = the big ZON and ZAT = the small ZON Malchut remained in GAR %0a%3c and Ateret Yesod replaced it in ZAT. %0a%3c %0a%3c As a result, the Upper Part of each degree remains concealed, just like Partzuf %0a%3c Atik, for Malchut does not descend from the place where she had ascended (NE) %0a%3c to her previous place in the Peh. And although in Gadlut, AHP return to their %0a%3c place or ascend to their own GE (which is one and the same), GE do not become %0a%3c filled with Ohr Hochma (the Light of GAR) as a result, since Malchut remains %0a%3c concealed in GE. Moreover, Malchut exists under the ban of T^imt^um Aleph on %0a%3c the reception of Ohr Hochma. Hence, GE remain with Ohr Hassadim. %0a%3c %0a%3c Only the lower part of each degree is filled with the Light of GAR (Hochma) %0a%3c in Gadlut: there was Avir (air) = Aleph-Vav-Yod-Reish, then the letter Yod departed %0a%3c from this word, and only the letters Ale£>h-Vat/-Reish remained to form the word %0a%3c Ohr (Light)-Ohr Hochma or GAR. %0a%3c %0a%3c It follows that all Partzufim of the world of At^ilut have GE, GAR of Kelim, %0a%3c Sefirot KHB HGT with Ohr Hassadim, the Light of VAK, whereas AHP, Sefirot %0a%3c NHY, Vak de Kelim in the Gadlut of the Partzuf are filled with Ohr Hochma, %0a%3c the Light of GAR. GE (GAR de Kelim) are filled with the Light of VAK (Ohr %0a%3c Hassadim), and AHP (VAK de Kelim) are filled with the Light of GAR (Ohr %0a%3c Hochma). It is therefore said that there's no greater Light for ZA in the world %0a%3c of Atzilut than the Light of VAK = six days, while GAR are concealed even in %0a%3c the Partzufim above ZA. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Lock and the Key %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 183 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 42. However, it is said in the secrets of creation of BERESHEET that He %0a%3c who is Holy and Concealed established the laws in Bina, in the secret and %0a%3c concealed, meaning Mcdchut of Partzuf Atik, which is a Partzuf with Mcdchut %0a%3c of Tzimtzum Aleph, who ascended to Bina and removed AHP de AA below %0a%3c its Rosh. And the same law that He established in Bina He established and %0a%3c concealed within, and everything is locked under one key. And He hid this key %0a%3c in a hall. And although everything is hidden in that hall, the most important %0a%3c thing is in that key, for it locks and unlocks everything. %0a%3c %0a%3c HE WHO IS HOLY AND CONCEALED is AA, for its Hochma is concealed. %0a%3c THE LAWS ARE ESTABLISHED IN IT, meaning in Malchut de Atik. The %0a%3c deficiency of the Kelim de AHP is confirmed. Malchut of Tzimtzum Aleph, called %0a%3c "the central point of all creation," is also the sole creation on which Tzimtzum %0a%3c Aleph was imposed. Contrary to her, if the screen stands not in Malchut, but in %0a%3c Yesod or, more precisely, in Ateret Yesod, the place of the covenant (circumcision), %0a%3c the place of the Zivug that was permitted after Tzimtzum Bet, this screen allows %0a%3c for the reception of Light. Hence, it is called the "point of population," and not %0a%3c the "central point." %0a%3c %0a%3c - Keter %0a%3c %0a%3c - Hochma %0a%3c %0a%3c - Bina %0a%3c %0a%3c - ZA Yesod %0a%3c %0a%3c - ZA— Malchut that received ZA's properties to "bestow," the popu- %0a%3c %0a%3c lated place %0a%3c %0a%3c - Malchut— no Zivug can be made; the deserted place %0a%3c %0a%3c The thing is that there is no GAR in AA, for the Supernal Malchut of Atik, %0a%3c within AA, is already corrected to the point of being in NE of her own Partzuf. %0a%3c In Gacllut, the screen descends from NE to Peh, which makes AHP return to %0a%3c their place, and a Zivug transpires on all ten Sefirot, which receive the GAR of %0a%3c the Light, Ohr Hochma. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, the screen in NE is called a "lock," for it blocks the entry of GAR %0a%3c of the Light into the Partzuf. The GAR of the Light are called Ohr Hochma. Yet, %0a%3c by descending from NE to Peh, the screen lets the Light into the Partzuf, and is %0a%3c therefore called Nikvey Eynaim (pupils of the eyes). %0a%3c %0a%3c Although Atik itself is in NE together with Malchut, it affects AA, and not %0a%3c Atik itself, as AA was created by the screen, located not in Malchut, but in Ateret %0a%3c Yesod (or simply in Yesod), and there is no Malchut in it. This is why it is not %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 184 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut that rules in NE de AA, but Ateret Yesod. And this is why, unlike the %0a%3c Light of Atik, its Light can be attained, for Malchut in Atik is the central point, %0a%3c which does not make a Zivug on Ohr Hochma. Although with regards to Atik, AA %0a%3c is AHP of Atik, AA itself has its own GE and AHP. %0a%3c %0a%3c Subsequently, AA created AVI and confirmed the absence of Ohr Hochma in %0a%3c them, due to the absence of AHP de Kelim. These AHP are the HALL in which %0a%3c the entire Light of Hochma is concealed (GAR de Neshama, GAR de Haya, and %0a%3c GAR de Yechida). This KEY IS KEPT HIDDEN IN A HALL Bina is a hall for %0a%3c Ohr Hochma. Malchut ascends to GAR de Bina (AVI) and rules there, but the %0a%3c absence of Ohr Hochma is not felt there, for the properties of AVI want only Ohr %0a%3c Hassadim; this is what is important to them, as it completely substitutes the Ohr %0a%3c Hochma. And VAK de Bina is ruled by the key, Ateret Yesod. %0a%3c %0a%3c IN THAT KEY, FOR IT LOCKS AND UNLOCKS EVERYTHING— %0a%3c concealments and revelations are made by Malchut that stands in NE: when %0a%3c Malchut ascends to NE she conceals Ohr Hochma, since in such a case, the Partzuf %0a%3c remains without its Kelim of AHP— it cannot use its desires to "receive" for the %0a%3c Creator's sake. Consequently, it contains no Ohr Hochma, for Ohr Hochma can %0a%3c only be received in Kelim de AHP. %0a%3c %0a%3c And when a Partzuf receives strength from Above to resist the egoistic %0a%3c desires of reception of its Kelim de AHP, and can receive for the Creator's sake, %0a%3c this means that it has acquired a screen against its desires, and can also work %0a%3c with them for the Creator. It then brings its Malchut back from the NE to the %0a%3c Peh. Put differently, it elevates its Kelim (desires of AHP) to the Rosh and begins %0a%3c to calculate how much Light it can receive within them for the Creator's sake. %0a%3c However, the received pleasure must not be too great, or it will make the Partzuf %0a%3c enjoy it egoistically. Afterwards, the Partzuf receives Ohr Hochma in its Guf. %0a%3c %0a%3c Thus, only Malchut that stands in NE allows or forbids the Light from %0a%3c entering the Partzuf. And since she must let the Light into the Partzuf in ZAT %0a%3c (where the rule belongs not to Malchut that ascended to NE, but to Ateret Yesod, %0a%3c called "key"), whereas the GAR of each Partzuf remain with Ohr Hassadim (they %0a%3c desire only the Light of Hassadim), letting the Light in or preventing it from %0a%3c entering the Partzuf depends only on the key, and not on Malchut herself. %0a%3c %0a%3c 43. That hall conceals tremendous treasures piled one upon the other. And %0a%3c there are fifty tightly closed gates in that hall, which are meant to block %0a%3c access to the Light. They were divided into four sides and became forty-nine %0a%3c gates, for one gate has no side, and it is unknown whether it exists above or %0a%3c below. Hence, it remained closed. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Lock and the Key %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 185 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c There are many types of GAR: GAR of Ohr Neshama, Haya, or Yechida. Each %0a%3c of them contains countless individual degrees and details. Hence, it is written, %0a%3c ONE UPON THE OTHER. Yet, as long as Malchut stands in NE, all these %0a%3c degrees of Light remain concealed and unknown. %0a%3c %0a%3c A gate signifies a vessel— a desire to receive the Light. In the spiritual world, %0a%3c there are no bodies, only desires. The desire itself is called "a body." If there is no %0a%3c desire, there is no body, as there is no vessel to receive the Light (pleasure). The %0a%3c bigger the desire, the "bigger" the body. However, all the bodies are similar in %0a%3c structure; just as a human body in our world consists of 613 parts, the spiritual %0a%3c body consists of 613 spiritual parts (desires). %0a%3c %0a%3c If one is able to use one of the desires of his spiritual body for the Creator's %0a%3c sake, such action is referred to as a Mitzva (commandment, good deed). The %0a%3c received Light is called "Torah." %0a%3c %0a%3c A spiritual Partzuf has a Rosh (head), the place where decisions are made. %0a%3c It contains only those desires that are known to be fit with a screen (resistance %0a%3c to the desires) to use them spiritually, altruistically, and to "reverse" them from %0a%3c "for one's own sake" to "for the sake of the Creator." If one has fulfilled all 613 %0a%3c commandments of the Torah and the seven Mitzvot (plural for Mitzva) of the %0a%3c nations of the world (620 Mitzvot in all), he thereby ascends 620 degrees and %0a%3c completely merges with the Creator. %0a%3c %0a%3c To observe all the commandments means to completely fill one's spiritual %0a%3c Partzuf with the Light of the Torah by fulfilling observant commandments %0a%3c (Mitzvot Aseh— positive Mitzvot) and prohibitory commandments (Mitzvot Lo %0a%3c Taaseh— negative Mitzvot). The fulfillment of the later lies in the unwillingness to %0a%3c receive the pleasure that is found within them. %0a%3c %0a%3c There are two types of desires or gates: when they are closed and receive %0a%3c nothing, and when they open and receive the Upper Light. When they are %0a%3c all closed, there are fifty of them. However, only forty-nine of the fifty can be %0a%3c opened. There are ten Sefirot KHB HGT NHYM or five Sefirot KHB ZA-M (as ZA %0a%3c consists of six Sefirot HGT NHY). However, Malchut also consists of these six, %0a%3c and hence includes all ten Sefirot. And since each of the five Sefirot consists of %0a%3c ten, in all they make up fifty. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, since a Zivug is made not on Malchut, but on Ateret Yesod, Malchut %0a%3c de Malchut itself does not receive the Light. Instead, Light is received by the four %0a%3c Sefirot KHB ZA that precede Malchut. Each of them consists of ten, hence 4 x 10 = %0a%3c 40 plus nine Sefirot from Keter to Yesod in Malchut herself yields 40 + 9 = 49. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 186 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Only one Sefira (Malchut de Malchut) out of the fifty does not receive the %0a%3c Light. This is because until all the Kelim (desires) have been completely corrected, %0a%3c the Light cannot enter it, as it is known in advance that Malchut de Malchut has %0a%3c no strength to oppose such a powerful egoistic desire to receive pleasure. %0a%3c %0a%3c Instead of being in Malchut de Malchut, the screen stands in Yesod de %0a%3c Malchut, and this place is called Brith (Covenant), the place where the Mitzva of %0a%3c circumcision must be kept, so as to make a Zivug not on Malchut herself (on the %0a%3c first restriction), but on Yesod, or rather, Ateret Yesod (on the second restriction). %0a%3c Malchut de Malchut itself is called "Shaar Nun" (the 50 th gate). This refers to %0a%3c Malchut of each Partzuf in the worlds ABYA. %0a%3c %0a%3c And although Malchut of Partzuf AVI descends from NE de AVI to her place %0a%3c in Peh, while AHP and YESHSUT that clothe them ascend to the degree of %0a%3c AVI, and AVI merges with YESHSUT into one Partzuf, as a result of which, %0a%3c Ohr Hochma descends to them from AA, AVI are unwilling and therefore do %0a%3c not receive anything from Ohr Hochma, and remain only with Ohr Hassadim, as %0a%3c though Malchut had never even descended from E^nazm to Peh. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, it is impossible to tell by the Light of AVI whether Malchut is %0a%3c located at the NE or at the Peh. On the contrary, by looking at AVI, it always %0a%3c seems to us that Malchut stands at NE. Only by the state of YESHSUT can we %0a%3c determine Malchut's location, for when she ascends to AVI in Gadlut (big state), %0a%3c YESHSUT receive Ohr Hochma. %0a%3c %0a%3c Although Malchut herself can receive Ohr Hochma in AVI, since AVI receive %0a%3c no Ohr Hochma whatsoever, they do not utilize their own Malchut. Since %0a%3c YESHSUT already has Ateret Yesod instead of Malchut, it receives the Light or %0a%3c "opens up," whereas AVI remain closed. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, the absence of the 50 th gate, the Zivug on Malchut herself in %0a%3c YESHSUT, causes the absence of the corresponding Light of Hochma in all the %0a%3c Partzufim. It is written about it: "fifty gates of Bina, and all are given to Moshe, %0a%3c except for one, the last secret of the absence of the Upper Light." For this %0a%3c Upper Light can be received only within the Kelim (desires) of Malchut herself, %0a%3c of primordial egoism, which will occur at the end of all the corrections, at the %0a%3c completion of the 6,000 years. %0a%3c %0a%3c 44. Those gates have one lock with a narrow space inside for inserting the %0a%3c key. It is unmarked, and recognized only by the impress of the key, which is %0a%3c unknown in that narrow space, but only in the key itself. And it is written of %0a%3c this secret: BERESHEET BARAH ELOKIM (IN THE BEGINNING THE %0a%3c CREATOR CREATED). "In the beginning" is the key, and all is concealed %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Lock and the Key %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 187 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c within it, as it unlocks and locks. And six gates are contained in this key, %0a%3c which locks and unlocks. When it locks those gates, encloses them within %0a%3c itself, it is written IN THE BEGINNING (BERESHEET): a revealed word, %0a%3c though it is usually concealed. BARAH (CREATED) is a concealed word %0a%3c everywhere, implying that the key unlocks it and locks it up. %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut that stands in NE is called a "lock," for she prevents Ohr Hochma %0a%3c from entering the Partzuf. The entire Partzuf ends in Hochma (the Light can only %0a%3c be in K-H). Hence, it is merely Nefesh-Ruach. After all, in the absence of Kelim- %0a%3c Sefirot B-ZA-M, the Lights Neshama-Haya-Yechida are absent. Yesod de Malchut is %0a%3c the 49 th gate, the maximum that can be before the end of correction, for Malchut %0a%3c de Malchut itself is the 50 th gate. %0a%3c %0a%3c If the key (Ateret Yesod of the Light) enters Yesod de Malchut (the 49 th gate), %0a%3c then this Light lowers Malchut to her place, from NE to Peh. This Light opens %0a%3c the Partzuf and Ohr Hochma fills it. This is why Ateret Yesod is called a "key." %0a%3c %0a%3c However, there is a special Reshimo that allows one to not use Malchut de %0a%3c Malchut as a place of Zivug before the final correction of all the others (except %0a%3c for Malchut de Malchut, Kelim-desires). This Reshimo is in AVI: since they never %0a%3c receive Ohr Hochma (they do not use this key), their real AHP do not ascend. %0a%3c Nevertheless, even their false AHP is sufficient to let YESHSUT receive Ohr %0a%3c Hochma and realize that knowledge signifies the presence of Ohr Hochma. %0a%3c %0a%3c If the Light that corresponds to Ateret Yesod enters the corresponding Sefira %0a%3c in Malchut (in Yesod de Malchut, the 49 th Sefira), then Malchut (the 50 th gate) does %0a%3c not forbid this Light to fill the Partzuf, does not "lock up" the Partzuf, as she %0a%3c contains the Reshimo of prohibition only on that which enters Malchut herself. %0a%3c The reason for it is that the Reshimo (the key's memory) rules in ZAT de Bina, %0a%3c that is, in YESHSUT. Hence, this Light is called a "key." %0a%3c %0a%3c And the word BERESHEET-IN THE BEGINNING-includes in itself only %0a%3c the key (Ateret Yesod, the 49 th Sefira), excluding Malchut de Malchut, the 50 th gate. %0a%3c However, none of the Sefirot KHB of all the Partzufim of the world of At^ilut %0a%3c receive Ohr Hochma; Ohr Hassadim shines within them instead. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, the words IN THE BEGINNING CREATED (BERESHEET %0a%3c BARAH) mean CONCEALED HOCHMA, for the word BARAH (created) is %0a%3c derived from the notion of BAR (beyond), which signifies moving Malchut de %0a%3c Malchut beyond the reception of Ohr Hochma; hence, this part of the Kelim was %0a%3c locked up by the absence of Light. %0a\ No newline at end of file%0a
