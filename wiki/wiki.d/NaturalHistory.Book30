text=BOOK XXX. %0a%0aREMEDIES DERIVED FROM LIVING CREATURES. %0a%0aCHAP. 1. (1.)-THE ORIGIN OF THE MAGIC ART. %0a%0aIn former parts of this work, I have had occasion more than %0aonce, when the subject demanded it, to refute the impostures %0aof the magic art, and it is now my intention to continue still %0afurther my exposure thereof. Indeed, there are few subjects %0aon which more might be profitably said, were it only that, %0abeing, as it is, the most deceptive of all known arts, it has %0aexercised the greatest influence in every country and in nearly %0aevery age. And no one can be surprised at the extent of its %0ainfluence and authority, when he reflects that by its own ener¬ %0agies it has embraced, and thoroughly amalgamated with itself, %0athe three other sciences 1 which hold the greatest sway upon %0athe mind of man. %0a%0aThat it first originated in medicine, no one entertains a %0adoubt ; 2 or that, under the plausible guise of promoting health, %0ait insinuated itself among mankind, as a higher and more holy %0abrauch of the medical art. Then, in the next place, to pro¬ %0amises the most seductive and the most flattering, it has added %0aall the resources of religion, a subject upon which, at the pre¬ %0asent day, man is still entirely in the dark. Last of all, to %0acomplete its universal sway, it has incorporated with itself the %0aastrological art ; 3 there being no man who is not desirous to %0aknow his future destiny, or who is not ready to believe that %0athis knowledge may with the greatest certainty be obtained, %0aby observing the face of the heavens. The senses of men %0abeing thus enthralled by a three-fold bond, the art of magic %0ahas attained an influence so mighty, that at the present day %0aeven, it holds sway throughout a great part of the world, and %0arules the kings 4 of kings in the East. %0a%0a1 “ Artes.” Medicine, religion, and the art of divination. %0a%0a2 Ajasson remarks that, on the contrary, this is a subject of great doubt. %0a%0a1 “ Mathematicas artes.” %0a%0a4 The title of the ancient kings of Persia. %0a%0a%0apliny’s natural history. %0a%0a%0a[Book XXX. %0a%0a%0a422 %0a%0a%0aCHAP. 2.-WHEN AND WHERE THE ART OF MAGIC ORIGINATED : %0a%0aBY WHAT PERSONS IT WAS FIRST PRACTISED. %0a%0aThere is no doubt that this art originated in Persia,® under %0aZoroaster, 6 this being a point upon which authors are generally %0aagreed; but whether there was only one Zoroaster, or whether %0ain later times there was a second person of that name, is a %0amatter which still remains undecided. Eudoxus, 7 who has %0aendeavoured to show that of all branches of philosophy the %0amagic art is the most illustrious and the most beneficial, in¬ %0aforms us that this Zoroaster existed six thousand years before %0athe death of Plato, an assertion in which he is supported by %0aAristotle. Hermippus,® again, an author who has written %0awith the greatest exactness on all particulars connected with %0athis art, and has commented upon the two millions 9 of verses %0aleft by Zoroaster, besides completing indexes to his several %0aworks, has left a statement, that Agonaces was the name of %0athe master from whom Zoroaster derived his doctrines, and %0athat he lived five thousand years before the time of the Trojan %0aWar. The first thing, however, that must strike us with Bur- %0aprise, is the fact that this art, and the traditions connected %0awith it, should have survived for so many ages, all written %0acommentaries thereon having perished in the meanwhile ; and %0athis, too, when there was no continuous succession of adepts, %0ano professors of note, to ensure their transmission. %0a%0aFor how few there are, in fact, who know anything, even %0aby hearsay, about the only professors of this art whose names %0ahave come down to us, Apusorus 10 and Zaratus of Media, %0aMarmarus and Arabantiphocus of Babylonia, and Tarmoendas %0aof Assyria, men who have left not the slightest memorials of %0atheir existence. But the most surprising thing of all is, that %0a%0a5 Or Bactriana, more properly. %0a%0aMagic, no doubt, has been the subject of belief from the earliest times, %0awhatever may have been the age of Zoroaster, the Zarathustra of theZend- %0aavesta, and the Zerdusht of the Persians. In the Zendavesta he is repre¬ %0asented as living in the reign of Gushtasp, generally identified with Darius %0aflystaspes. He probably lived at a period anterior to that of the Median %0aand Persian kings. Niebuhr regards him as a purely mythical personage %0a' See end of B. n. « See end of this Book. %0a%0a1 An exaggeration, of Oriental origin, most probably %0a16 These names have all, most probably, been transmitted to us in a cor¬ %0arupted form. Ajasson gives some suggestions as to their probable Eastern %0atomi and origin. %0a%0a%0aChnp. 2.] %0a%0a%0aWIIO FIRST PRACTISED MAGIC. %0a%0a%0a423 %0a%0a%0aHomer should he total]}’’ silent upon this art in his account 11 of %0athe Trojan War, while in his story of the wanderings of %0aUlysses, so much of the work should be taken up with it, that %0awe may justly conclude that the poem is based upon nothing %0aelse; if, indeed, we are willing to grant that his accounts of %0aProteus and of the songs of the Sirens are to be understood in %0athis sense, and that the stories of Circe and of the summoning %0aup of the shades below, 12 bear reference solely to the practices %0aof sorcerers. And then, too, to come to more recent times, no %0aone has told us how the art of sorcery reached Telmessus, 13 a %0acity devoted to all the services of religion, or at what period it %0acame over and reached the matrons of Thessaly; whose name 14 %0ahas long passed, in our part of the world, as the appellation of %0athose who practise an art, originally introduced among them¬ %0aselves even, from foreign lands. 15 For in the days of the Trojan %0aWar, Thessaly was still contented with such remedies 16 as she %0aowed to the skill of Chiron, and her only 17 lightnings were the %0alightnings hurled by Mars. 18 Indeed, for my own part, I am %0asurprised that the imputation of magical practices should have so %0astrongly attached to the people once under the sway of Achilles, %0athat Menander even, a man unrivalled for perception in lite¬ %0arary knowledge, has entitled one of his Comedies “The Thes¬ %0asalian Matron,” and has therein described the devices practised %0aby the females of that country in bringing down the moon %0afrom the heavens. 18 * I should have been inclined to think %0athat Orpheus had been the first to introduce into a country so %0anear his own, certain magical superstitions based upon the %0apractice of medicine, were it not the fact that Thrace, his %0anative land, was at that time totally a stranger to the magic %0aart. %0a%0a11 One among the many proofs, Ajasson says, that the Iliad and the %0aOdyssey belong to totally different periods. %0a%0a14 In reference to the Tenth Book of the Odyssey. %0a%0a13 See B. v. cc. 28, 29. Cicero mentions a college of Aruspices estab¬ %0alished at this city. %0a%0a14 The name “Thessala” was commonly used by the Romans to signify %0a%0aan enchantress, sorceress, or witch. See the story ot Apuleius, Books i. %0aand iii. 15 The countries of the East. %0a%0a16 Purely medicinal remedies. %0a%0a17 In contradistinction to lightnings elicited by the practice of Magic. %0a%0als A poetical figure, alluding to the “ thunderbolts of war,” as wielded %0aprobably by Achilles and other heroes of Thessaly. %0a%0alb * See B. ii. c. 9. %0a%0a%0a424 %0a%0a%0aplist’s natuhal histout. %0a%0a%0a[Book XXX. %0a%0a%0aThe first person, so far as I can ascertain, who wrote upon %0amagic, and whose works are still in existence, was Osthanes, 1 ’ %0awho accompanied Xerxes, the Persian king, in his expedition %0aagainst Greece. It was he who first 20 disseminated, as it were, %0athe germs of this monstrous art, and tainted therewith all parts %0aof the world through which the Persians passed. Authors %0a■who have made diligent enquiries into this subject, make men¬ %0ation of a second Zoroaster, a native of Proconnesus, as living a %0alittle before the time of Osthanes. That it was this samo %0aOsthanes, more particularly, that inspired the Greeks, not with %0aa fondness only, but a rage, for the art of magic, , is a fact be¬ %0ayond all doubt: though at the same time I would remark, %0athat in the most ancient times, and indeed almost invariably, %0ait w r as in this 21 branch of science, that was sought the highest %0apoint of celebrity and of literary renown. At all events, %0aPythagoras, we find, Empedocles, Democritus, and Plato, %0acrossed the seas, in order to attain a knowledge thereof, sub¬ %0amitting, to speak the truth, more to the evils of exile 22 than %0ato the mere inconveniences of travel. Returning home, it was %0aupon the praises of this art that they expatiated—it was this %0athat they held as one of their grandest mysteries. It was %0aDemocritus, too, who first drew attention to Apollobeches 23 of %0aCoptos, to Dardanus, 24 and to Phoenix : the works of Dardanus %0ahe sought in the tomb of that personage, and his own were %0acomposed in accordance with the doctrines there found. That %0athese doctrines should have been received by any portion of %0amankind, and transmitted to us by the aid of memory, is to %0ame surprising beyond anything I can conceive. 25 All the par¬ %0aticulars there found are so utterly incredible, so utterly re- %0a%0a19 Ajasson queries whether thisisapropername,or an epithet merely. %0a%0a20 Ajasson combats this assertion at considerable length, and with good %0areason. It is quite inadmissible. %0a%0a21 The mysteries of philosophy, as Ajasson remarks, were not necessarily %0aidentical with the magic art. %0a%0a22 In reality, Pythagoras was an exile from the tyranny of the ruler of %0aSamos, Plato from the court of Dionysius the Younger, and Democritus %0afrom the ignorance of his fellow-countrymen of Abdera. There is no %0adoubt that Pythagoras and Democritus made considerable researches into %0athe art of magic as practised in the East. %0a%0a23 Nothing is known of this writer. %0a%0a24 Dardanus, the ancestor of the Trojans, if he is the person here meant, %0ais said to have introduced the worship of the gods into Samothrace. %0a%0a25 The works of Homer were transmitted in a similar manner. %0a%0a%0aChap. 3.] WHETHER MAGIC WAS EVER PRACTISED IK ITALY. 425 %0a%0avolting, that those even who admire Democritus in other %0arespects, are strong in their denial that these works were really %0awritten by him. Their denial, however, is in vain; for it %0awas he, beyond all doubt, who had the greatest share in fas¬ %0acinating men’s minds with these attractive chimseras. %0a%0aThere is also a marvellous coincidence, in the fact that the %0atwo arts — medicine, I mean, and magic — were developed %0asimultaneously : medicine by the writings of Hippocrates, and %0amagic by the works of Democritus, about the period of the %0aPeloponnesian War, which was waged in Greece in the year %0aof the City of Rome 300. %0a%0aThere is another sect, also, of adepts in the magic art, who %0aderive their origin from Moses, 26 Jaimes, 27 and Lotapea, 28 Jews %0aby birth, 29 but many thousand years posterior to Zoroaster : and %0aas much more recent, again, is the branch of magic culti¬ %0avated in Cyprus. 60 In the time, too, of Alexander the Great, %0athis profession received no small accession to its credit from %0athe influence of a second Osthanes, who had the honour of %0aaccompanying that prince in his expeditions, and who, evi¬ %0adently, beyond all doubt, travelled S1 over every part of the %0aworld. %0a%0a%0aCHAP. 3.-WHETHER MAGIC WAS EVER PRACTISED IK ITALY. AT %0a%0aWHAT PERIOD THE SENATE FIRST FORBADE HUMAN SACRIFICES. %0a%0aIt is clear that there are early traces still existing of the %0a%0a26 Moses, no doubt, was represented by the Egyptian priesthood as a %0amagician, in reference more particularly to the miracles wrought by him %0abefore Pharaoh. From them the Greeks would receive the notion. %0a%0a27 In 2 Tim. iii. 8, we find the words, “Now as Jannes and Jambres %0a■withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth.’’ Eusebius, in his Prcc- %0aparatio Evangelica, B. ix., states that Jannes and Jambres, or Mambres, %0awere the names of Egyptian writers, who practised Magic, and opposed %0aMoses before Pharaoh. This contest was probably represented by the %0aEgyptian priesthood as merely a dispute between two antagonistic schools %0aof Idagic. %0a%0a28 Of this person nothing is known. The former editions mostly have %0a“ Jotapea.’’ “ Jotapata” was the name of a town in Syria, the birthplace %0aof Josephus. %0a%0a29 lie is mistaken here as to the nation to which Jannes belonged. %0a%0aso By some it has been supposed that this bears reference to Christianity, %0aas introduced into Cyprus by the Apostle Barnabas Owing to the miracles %0awrought in the infancy of the Church, the religion of the Christians was %0avery generally looked upon as a sort of Magic. The point is very doubtful. %0a%0a31 ilis itinerary, Ajassou remarks, would have been a great curiosity. %0a%0a%0a426 %0a%0a%0aflint's natural history. %0a%0a%0a[Hook XXX. %0a%0a%0aintroduction of magic into Italy; in our laws of the Twelve %0aTables for instance; besides other convincing proofs, which I %0ahave already noticed in a preceding Book. 33 At last, in the %0ayear of the City 657, Cneius Cornelius Lentulus and P. Lici- %0anius Crassus being consuls, a decree forbidding human sacri¬ %0afices 33 was passed by the senate ; from which period the cele¬ %0abration of these horrid rites ceased in public, and, for some ‘ %0atime, altogether. %0a%0aCHAP. 4.-THE DRUIDS OF THE GALLIC PROVINCES. %0a%0aThe Gallic provinces, too, were pervaded by the magic art,' 5 %0aand that even down to a period within memory ; for it was %0athe Emperor Tiberius that put down their Druids, 36 and all that %0atribe of wizards and physicians. But why make further men¬ %0ation of these prohibitions, with reference to an art which has %0anow crossed the very Ocean even, and has penetrated to the %0avoid 37 recesses of Nature? At the present day, struck with %0afascination, Britannia still cultivates this art, and that, with %0aceremonials so august, that she might almost seem 38 to have %0abeen the first to communicate them to the people of Persia. 39 %0aTo such a degree are nations throughout the whole world, %0atotally different as they are and quite unknown to one another, %0ain accord upon this one point! %0a%0a32 B. xxviii. c. 4. %0a%0a33 These sacrifices forming the most august rite of the Magic art, as %0apractised in Italy. %0a%0a34 That this art was still practised in secret in the days of Pliny himself, %0awe learn from the testimony of Tacitus (Annals, II. 69), in his account of %0athe enquiries instituted on the death of Germanicus. %0a%0a35 More particularly in the worship of their divinity lieu or Hesus, the %0agod of war. %0a%0a36 This he did officially, but not effectually, and the Druids survived as %0aa class for many centuries both in Gaul and Britain. %0a%0a37 He alludes to the British shores bordering on the Atlantic. See B. %0axix. c. 2. %0a%0a33 It is a curious fact that the round towers of Ireland bear a strong re¬ %0asemblance to those, the ruins of which are still to be seen on the plains of %0aancient Persia. %0a%0a39 “ Ut dedisse Persis videri possit.” This might possibly mean, “That %0aPersia might almost seem to have communicated it direct to Britain.” Ajas- %0ason enumerates the following superstitions of ancient Britain, as bearing %0aprobable marks of an Oriental origin: the worship of the stars, lakes, %0aforests, and rivers; the ceremonials used in cutting the plants samiolus, %0aselago, and mistletoe, and the virtues attributed to the adder’s egg. %0a%0a%0aChap. 5.] THE VARIOUS BRANCHES OF MAGIC. 427 %0a%0aSuch being the fact, then, we cannot too highly appreciate %0athe obligation that is due to the Roman people, for having put %0aan end to those monstrous rites, in accordance with which, to %0amurder a man was to do an act of the greatest devoutness, and %0ato eat 40 his flesh was to secure the highest blessings of health. %0a%0aCHAP. 5. (2.)—THE VARIOUS BRANCHES OF MAGIC. %0a%0aAccording to what Osthanes tells us, there are numerous %0asorts of magic. It is practised 41 with water, for instance, with %0aballs, by the aid of the air, of the stars, of lamps, basins, hatchets, %0aand numerous other appliances; means by which it engages %0ato grant a foreknowledge of things to come, as well as converse %0awith ghosts and spirits of the dead. All these practices, how¬ %0aever, have been proved by the Emperor Hero, in our own day, %0ato be so many false and chimaerical illusions; entertaining as %0ahe did a passion for the magic art, unsurpassed even by his %0aenthusiastic love for the music of the lyre, and for the songs of %0atragedy; so strangely did his elevation to the highest point %0aof human fortune act upon the deep-seated vices of his mind ! %0aIt was his leading desire to command the gods of heaven, and %0ano aspiration could he conceive more noble than this. Never %0adid person lavish more favours upon any one of the arts ; and %0afor the attainment of this, his favourite object, nothing was %0awanting to him, neither riches, nor power, nor aptitude at %0alearning, and what not besides, at the expense of a suffering %0aworld. %0a%0aIt is a boundless, an indubitable proof, I say, of the utter %0afalsity of this art, that such a man as Nero abandoned it; and %0awould to heaven that he had consulted the shades below, and %0aany other spirits as well, in order to be certified in his sus¬ %0apicions, rather than commissioned the denizens of stews and %0abrothels to make those inquisitions of his [with reference to %0athe objects of his jealousy]. For assuredly there can be no %0a%0a40 Ajasson seems inclined to suggest that this may possibly bear reference %0ato the Christian doctrines of redemption and the Sacrament of the Lord's %0aSupper. %0a%0a41 These kinds of divination, rather than magic, were called hydromancy, %0asphaeromancy, aeromancy, astromancy, lychnomancy, lecanomancy, and %0aaxinomancy. See Rabelais, B. iii. c. 25, where a very full account is given %0aof the Magic Art, as practised by the ancients. Coffee-grounds, glair of %0aeggs, and rose-leaves, are still used in France for purposes ot divination %0aby the superstitious. %0a%0a%0a428 %0a%0a%0apliny’s natural history. %0a%0a%0a[Book XXX. %0a%0a%0asuperstition, however barbarous and ferocious the rites which %0ait sanctions, that is not more tolerant than the imaginations %0awhich he conceived, and owing to which, by a series of blood¬ %0astained crimes, our abodes were peopled with ghosts. %0a%0aCHAP. 6.—THE SUBTERFUGES PRACTISED BY THE MAGICIANS. %0a%0aThe magicians, too, have certain modes of evasion, as, for %0ainstance, that the gods will not obey, or even appear to, persons %0awho have freckles upon the skin. Was this perchance the %0aobstacle 42 in Nero’s way ? As for his limbs, there was 43 nothing %0adeficient in them. And then, besides, he was at liberty to %0amake choice of the days prescribed by the magic ritual: it %0awas an easy thing for him to make choice of sheep whose %0acolour was no other than perfectly black: and as to sacrificing %0ahuman beings, there was nothing in the world that gave him %0agreater pleasure. The Magian Tiridates 44 was at his court, %0ahaving repaired thither, in token of our triumph over Armenia, %0aaccompanied by a train which cost dear to the provinces through %0awhich it passed. For the fact was, that he was unwilling to %0atravel by water, it being a maxim with the adepts in this art %0athat it is improper to spit into the sea or to profane that element %0aby any other of the evacuations that are inseparable from the %0ainfirmities of human nature. He brought with him, too, %0aseveral other Magi, and went so far as to initiate the emperor %0ain the repasts 45 of the craft; and yet the prince, for all he had %0abestowed a kingdom upon the stranger, found himself unable %0ato receive at his hands, in return, this art. %0a%0aWe may rest fully persuaded then, that magic is a thing %0adetestable in itself. Frivolous and lying as it is, it still bears, %0ahowever, some shadow of truth upon it; though reflected, in %0areality, by the practices of those who study the arts of secret %0apoisoning, and not the pursuits of magic. Let any one picture %0ato himself the lies of the magicians of former days, when he %0alearns what has been stated by the grammarian Apion, 46 a %0a%0a42 Suetonius says that his body was full of foul spots. %0a%0a43 It was probably a doctrine of Magic, that an adept must not be de¬ %0aficient in any of his limbs. %0a%0a44 After being conquered by the Roman general, Corbulo, he received %0athe crown of Armenia from Nero, a.d. 63. %0a%0a45 All vegetable substances were divided, according to their doctrine, into %0athe pure and the impure, the rule being strictly observed at their repasts. %0a%0a46 See end of this Rook. %0a%0a%0ad,ap. 7.] REMEDIES DERITED FROM THE MOI.F,. 429 %0a%0aperson whom I remember seeing myself when young. He %0atells us that the plant cynocephalia, 47 known in Egypt as %0a“osiritis,” is useful for divination, and is a preservative against %0aall the malpractices of magic, but that if a person takes it out %0aof the ground entire, he will die upon the spot. He asserts, %0aalso, that he himself had raised the spirits 48 of the dead, in %0aorder to make enquiry of Homer in reference to his native %0acountry and his parents; but he does not dare, he tells us, %0adisclose the answer he received. %0a%0aCHAP. 7. (3.)—OPINIONS OF THE MAGICIANS RELATIVE TO THE %0aMOLE. FIVE REMEDIES DERIVED FROM IT. %0a%0aLet the following stand as a remarkable proof of the frivo¬ %0alous nature of the magic art. Of all animals it is the mole %0athat the magicians admire most ! a creature that has been %0astamped with condemnation by Nature in so many waj r s; %0adoomed as it is to perpetual blindness, 49 and adding to this %0adarkness a life of gloom in the depths of the earth, and a state %0amore nearly resembling that of the dead and buried. There %0ais no animal in the entrails of which they put such implicit %0afaith, no animal, they think, better suited for the rites of reli¬ %0agion ; so much so, indeed, that if a person swallows the heart of %0aa mole, fresh from the body and still palpitating, he will receive %0athe gift of divination, they assure us, and a foreknowledge of %0afuture events. Tooth-ache, they assert, may be cured by %0ataking the tooth of a live mole, and attaching it to the body. %0aAs to other statements of theirs relative to this animal, we %0ashall draw attention to them on the fitting occasions, and shall %0aonly add here that one of the most probable ot all their asser¬ %0ations is, that the mole neutralizes the bite of the shrew-mouse; %0aseeing that, as already 60 stated, the very earth even that is %0afound in the rut of a cart-wheel, acts as a remedy in such a %0acase. %0a%0a47 See B. xxv. c. 80. %0a%0a48 Like the assertions of the famous impostor of the close of the last %0acentury, Count Cagliostro. %0a%0a49 A mistake, of course; and one for which there is little excuse, as its %0a%0aeyes are easily perceptible. It is not improbable, however, that it was an %0aimpression with the ancients that its sight, is impeded by the horny covering %0aof its eyes. 5t > In B. xxix. c. 27. %0a%0a%0a430 %0a%0a%0apmst’s natural history. %0a%0a%0a[Book XXX. %0a%0a%0aCHAP. 8.-THE OTHER REMEDIES DERIVED FROM LIVING CUEATlKKs, %0a%0aCLASSIFIED ACCORDING TO THE RESPECTIVE DISEASES. REMEDIES %0a%0aFOR TOOTH-ACHE. %0a%0aBut to proceed with the remedies for tooth-ache—the magi- %0acians tell us, that it may be cured by using the ashes of the %0ahead of a dog that has died in a state of madness. The head, %0ahowever, must he burnt without the flesh, and the ashes %0ainjected with oil of Cyprus 51 into the ear on the side affected. %0aFor the same purpose also, the left eye-tooth of a dog is used, %0athe gum of the affected tooth being lanced with it; one of the %0avertebrae also of a dragon or of an enhydris, which is a male %0awhite serpent. 52 The eye-tooth, too, of this last, is used for %0ascarifying the gums; and when the pain affects the teeth of the %0aupper jaw, they attach to the patient two of the upper teeth of %0athe serpent, and, similarly, two of the lower ones for tooth-ache %0ain the lower jaw. Persons who go in pursuit of the crocodile, %0aanoint themselves with the fat of this animal. The gums are %0aalso scarified with the frontal bones of a lizard, taken from %0ait at full moon, and not allowed to touch the ground: or else %0athe mouth is rinsed with a decoction of dogs’ teeth in wiue, %0aboiled down to one half. %0a%0aAshes of dogs’ teeth, mixed with honey, are useful for %0adifficult dentition in children, and a dentifrice is similarly %0aprepared from them. Hollow teeth are plugged with ashes of %0aburnt mouse-dung, or with a lizard’s liver, dried. To eat a %0asnake’s heart, or to wear it, attached to the body, is considered %0ahighly efficacious. There are some among the magicians, who %0arecommend a mouse to be eaten twice a month, as a preventive %0aof tooth-ache. Earth-worms, boiled in oil and injected into %0athe ear on the side affected, afford considerable relief: ashes, %0atoo, of burnt earth-worms, introduced into carious teeth, make %0athem come out easily; and, used as a friction, they allay pains %0ain such of the teeth as are sound: the proper way of burning %0athem is in an earthen potsherd. They are useful, too, boiled %0awith root of the mulberry-tree in squill vinegar, and employed %0aas a collutory for the teeth. The small worm that is found %0ain the plant known as Venus’ 53 bath, is remarkably useful, %0a%0a51 See B. xii. c. 51. %0a%0a52 It is doubtful what is meant by this mole white “ water-serpent." %0aIn B. xxxii. c. 26, lie appears to include it among the fishes. %0a%0a53 See B. xxv. c. 108. %0a%0a%0aChap. 8.] %0a%0a%0aREMEDIES FOB. TOOTH-ACIIE. %0a%0a%0a' 431 %0a%0a%0aintroduced 51 into a hollow tooth ; and as to the cabbage cater¬ %0apillar, it will make hollow teeth come out, by the mere contact %0aonly. The bugs 55 that are found upon mallows, are injected %0ainto the ears, beaten up with oil of roses. %0a%0aThe small grits of sand that are found in the horns of snails, %0aintroduced into hollow teeth, remove the pain instantaneously. %0aAshes of empty snail-shells, mixed with myrrh, 56 are good for %0athe gums ; the ashes also of a serpent., burnt wdth salt in an %0aearthen pot, and injected, with oil of roses, into the ear opposite %0ato the side affected ; or else the slough of a snake, warmed with %0aoil and torch-pine resin, 57 and injected into either ear. Some %0apersons add frankincense and oil of roses, a preparation which, %0aof itself, introduced into hollow teeth, makes them come out %0awithout pain. It is all a fiction, in my opinion, to say that %0awhite snakes cast this slough about the rising of the Dog-star; %0afor such a thing has never been seen in Italy, and it is still %0amore improbable that sloughing should take place at so late %0aa period in the warmer climates. We find it stated also, that this %0aslough, even when it has been kept for some time, mixed with %0awax, will extract a tooth very expeditiously, if applied there¬ %0ato : a snake’s tooth, also, attached to the body as an amulet, %0aallays tooth-ache. Some persons think that it is a good remedy %0ato catch a spider with the left hand, to beat it up with oil of %0aroses, and then to inject it into the ear on the side affected. %0a%0aThe small bones of poultry, preserved in a hole in a wall, %0athe medullary channel being left intact, will immediately cure %0atooth-ache, they say, if the tooth is touched or the gum %0ascarified therewith, care being taken to throw away the bone %0athe moment the operation is performed. A similar result is %0aobtained by using raven’s dung, wrapped in wool and attached %0ato the body, or else sparrow’s dung, warmed with oil and in¬ %0ajected into the ear on the side affected. This last remedy, %0ahowever, is productive of an intolerable itching, for which %0areason it is considered a better plan to rub the part with the %0aashes of young sparrows burnt upon twigs, mixed with vinegar %0afor the purpose. %0a%0a®* It is a singular tiling that we still bear of the maggots found in filberte %0abeing used for the same purpose. %0a%0a5J See B. xxix. c. 17. %0a%0aM Marcus Empiricus says, honey. 57 See B. xvi. c. 19. %0a%0a%0a432 %0a%0a%0apltny’s natural hi stout. %0a%0a%0a[Book XXX. %0a%0a%0aCHAL’. 9.

To pick %0athe teeth with a vulture’s feather, is productive of a sour %0abreath ; but to use a porcupine’s quill for that purpose, greatly %0astrengthens the teeth. Ulcers of the tongue and lips are cured %0aby taking a decoction of swallows, boiled in honied wine; and %0achapped lips are healed by using goose-grease or poultry-grease, %0awool-grease mixed with nut-galls, white spiders’ webs, or the %0afine cobwebs that are found adhering to the beams of roofs. %0aIf the inside of the mouth has been scalded with any hot sub¬ %0astance, bitches’ milk will afford an immediate cure. %0a%0aCHAP. 10.-REMEDIES FOR SPOTS UPON THE FACE. %0a%0aWool-grease, mixed with Corsican honey—which by the way %0ais considered the most acrid honey of all—removes spots upon %0athe face. Applied with oil of roses in wool, it causes scurf upon %0athe face to disappear : some persons add butter to it. In eases %0aof morphew, the spots are first pricked with a needle, and then %0arubbed with dog’s gall. For livid spots and bruises on the %0aface, the lights of a ram or sheep are cut fine and applied %0awarm, or else pigeons’ dung is used. Goose-grease or poultry- %0agrease is a good preservative of the skin of the face. For %0alichens a liniment is used, made of mouse-dung in vinegar, or %0aof the ashes of a hedge-hog mixed with oil: but, when these %0aremedies are employed, it is recommended first to foment the %0aface with nitre dissolved in vinegar. Maladies of the face are also %0aremoved by employing the ashes of the small, broad, snail that %0ais so commonly found, mixed with honey. Indeed, the asheB %0aof all snails are of an inspissative nature, and are possessed of %0acertain calorific and detersive properties : hence it is that they %0aform an ingredient in caustic applications, and are used in the %0aform of a liniment for itch-scabs, leprous sores, and freckles on %0athe face. %0a%0aI find it stated that a certain kind of ant known by the name %0aof “ Herculanea,” 68 is beaten up, with the addition of a little %0a%0a58 Dalechamps thinks that these “ Herculean ” ants were so called from %0atheir great size.

The buprestis 60 %0ais an insect but rarely found in Italy, and very similar to a %0ascarabaeus, with long legs. Concealed among the grass, it is %0avery liable to be swallowed unobserved, by oxen in particular; %0aand the moment it comes in contact with the gall, it causes %0asuch a degree of inflammation, that the animal bursts asunder; %0aa circumstance to which the insect owes its name. Applied %0atopically with he-goat suet, it removes lichens on the face, %0aowing to its corrosive properties, as previously 05 stated. A %0avulture’s blood, beaten up with cedar resin and root of white %0achamaeleon—a plant which we have already 61 mentioned—and %0acovered with a cabbage leaf, when applied, is good for the cure %0aof leprosy; the same, too, with the legs of locusts, beaten up %0awith he-goat suet. Pimples are treated with poultry grease, %0abeaten up and kneaded with onions. One very useful sub¬ %0astance lor the face is honey in which the bees have died; but a %0asovereign detergent lor that part is swans’ grease, which has %0aalso the property of effacing wrinkles. Erand-marks 63 are %0aremoved by using pigeons’ dung, diluted in vinegar. %0a%0aCHAP. 11.- REMEDIES FOR AFFECTIONS OF THE THROAT. %0a%0aI find it stated that catarrhs oppressive to the head may be %0acured by the patient kissing a mule’s nostrils. Affections of %0athe uvula and pains in the fauces are alleviated by using the dung %0aof lambs before they have begun to graze, dried in the shade. %0aDiseases of the uvula are cured with the juices of a snail pierced %0awith a needle; the snail, however, must be then hung up in the %0asmoke. The same maladies are treated also with ashes of %0aburnt, swallows, mixed with honey; a preparation which is %0aequally good for affections of the tonsillary glands. Sheep’s %0amilk, used as a gargle, alleviates diseases of the fauces and %0atonsillary glands. Millepedes, bruised with pigeons’ dung, are %0ataken as a gargle, with raisin wine ; and they are'applied, exter¬ %0anally, with dried figs and nitre, for the purpose of soothing %0aroughness of the fauces and catarrhs.

But of all the remedies %0aspoken of as furnished by the swallow, one of the most effica¬ %0acious is that derived from the y r oung of the wild swallow, a %0abird which may be easily recognized by the peculiar conforma¬ %0ation of its nest . 61 By far the most effectual, however, of them %0aall, are the young of the bank-swallow , 68 that being the name %0agiven to the kind which builds its nest in holes on the banksof %0arivers. Many persons recommend the young of any kind of %0aswallow as a food, assuring us that the person who takes it %0aneed be in no apprehension of quinzy for the whole of the %0aensuing year. The young of this bird are sometimes stifled %0aand then burnt in a vessel with the blood, the ashes being %0aadministered to the patient with bread or in the drink: some, %0ahowever, mix with them the ashes of a burnt weasel, in equal %0aproportion. The same remedies are recommended also for %0ascrofula, and they are administered for epilepsy, once a day, in %0adrink. Swallows preserved in salt are taken for quinzy, in %0adoses of one drachma, in drink: the nest , 69 too, of the bird, %0ataken internally, is said to be a cure for the same disease. %0a%0aMillepedes , 10 it is thought, used in the form of a liniment, are %0apeculiarly efficacious for quinzy : some persons, also, administer %0aeleven of them, bruised in one semi-sextarius of hydromel, %0athrough a reed, they being of no use whatever if once touched %0aby the teeth. Other remedies mentioned are, the broth of a %0a%0a63 See B. iv. c. 23, B. viii. c. 59, and cc. 15 and 43 of the present Book. %0a%0a54 “ Smegma.” 65 See B. xx. c. 2. %0a%0a66 No very great obligation, apparently. %0a%0a" 7 See B. x. c. 49. 69 “ Riparia.” %0a%0aM The only birds’ nests that are now taken internally are the aouthm %0alotirong, or, edible birds’ nests, of the Chinese. %0a%0a50 See B. xxix. c. 39. %0a%0a%0aChap. 12.] %0a%0a%0aBEMKDIES FOE SCEOFULA. %0a%0a%0a43.0 %0a%0a%0amouse boiled with vervain, a thong of dogskin passed three %0atimes round the back, and pigeons’ dung mixed with wine and %0aoil.

For ulcerated scrofula, a weasel’s blood is employed, or %0athe animal itself, boiled in wine ; but not in cases where the %0atumours have been opened with the knife. It is said, too, %0athat a weasel, eaten with the food, is productive of a similar %0aeffect; sometimes, also, it is burnt upon twigs, and the ashes %0aare applied with axle-grease. In some instances, a green lizard %0ais attached to the body of the patient, a fresh one being sub¬ %0astituted at the end of thirty days. Some persons preserve the %0aheart of this animal in a small silver vessel, 11 as a cure for %0ascrofula in females. Old snails, those found adhering to shrubs %0amore particularly, are pounded with the shells on, and applied %0aas a liniment. Asps, too, are similarly employed, reduced to %0aashes and mixed with bull suet; snakes’ fat also, diluted with %0aoil; and the ashes of a burnt snake, applied •with oil or wax. %0aIt is a good plan also, in cases of scrofula, to eat the middle %0aof a snake, the extremities being first removed, or to drink %0athe ashes of the reptile, similarly prepared and burnt in a %0anew earthen vessel: they will be found much more efficacious, %0ahowever, when the snake has been killed between the ruts %0amade by wheels. It is recommended also, to dig up a cricket %0awith the earth about its hole, and to apply it in the form of a %0aliniment; to use pigeons’ dung, either by itself, or with barley- %0ameal, or oatmeal and vinegar; or else to apply the ashes ot a %0aburnt mole, mixed with honey. %0a%0aSome persons apply the liver of this last animal, crumbled %0ain the hands, due care being taken not to wash it off for three %0adays : it is said, too, that a mole’s right foot is a remedy for %0ascrofula. Others, again, cut off the head of a mole, and after %0akneading it with earth thrown up by those animals, divide %0ait into tablets, and keep it in a pewter box, for the treatment %0aof all kinds of tumours, diseases of the neck, and the affections %0aknown as “ apostemes in all such cases the use of swine s %0a%0a71 Marcus Empiricus says that the heart must be enclosed in a silver %0alupine and worn suspended from the neck, being efficacious for scrofula %0aboth in males and females, ihe silver lupine was probably what we. %0ashould call a “locket.” %0a%0aF F 2 %0a%0a%0a436 %0a%0a%0aI’Ll NT’S NATURAL HI STOUT. %0a%0a%0a[Hook XXX. %0a%0a%0aflesh is forbidden to the patient. “ Taurus ” 72 is the name %0ausually given to an earth-beetle, very similar to a tick in %0aappearance, and which it derives from the diminutive horns %0awith which it is furnished : some persons call it the “ earth- %0alouse .” 73 From the earth thrown up by these insects a lini¬ %0ament is prepared for scrofula and similar diseases, and for gout, %0athe application not being washed off till the end of three days. %0aThis last remedy is effectual for a whole year, and all those %0aother properties are attributed to it which we have mentioned ’ 1 %0awhen speaking of crickets. There are some, again, who make %0aa similar use of the earth thrown up by ants; while others %0aattach to the patient as many earth-worms as there are scrofu¬ %0alous tumours, the sores drying as the worms dry up. %0a%0aSome persons cut off the head and tail of a viper, as already %0amentioned , 75 about the rising of the Dog-star, which done, they %0aburn the middle, and give a pinch of the ashes in three fingers, %0afor thrice seven days, in drink—such is the plan they use for %0athe cure of scrofula. Others, again, pass round the scrofulous %0atumours a linen thread, with which a viper has been suspended %0aby the neck till dead. Millepedes 76 are also used, with one %0afourth part of turpentine; a remedy which is equally recom¬ %0amended for the cure of all kinds of apostemes. %0a%0aCHAP. 13 .- REMEDIES FOR DISEASES OF THE SHOULDERS. %0a%0aThe ashes of a burnt weasel, mixed with wax, are a cure %0afor pains in the shoulders. To prevent the arm-pits of young %0apersons from becoming hairy, they should be well rubbed with %0aants’ eggs. Slave-dealers also, to impede the growth of %0athe hair in young persons near puberty, employ the blood that %0a%0a73 “The bull.” Dalechamps takes this to be the stag-beetle or bull-fly; %0abut that, as Ajasson remarks, has four horns, two antennte, and two large %0amandibules; in addition to which, from its size, it would hardly be called %0athe “ earth-louse.” He concludes that a lamellicorn is meant; but whether %0abelonging to the Lucanidse or the Scarabceidm, it is impossible to say. %0a%0a73 “ Pediculus terra.” %0a%0a74 In B. xxix. c. 33 . 75 In B. xxix. c. 21. %0a%0a76 He probably speaks of woodlice here.

The dogs, 19 too, which we %0acall “ Melifaei,” applied to the stomach every now and then, %0aallay pains in that region : the malady, it is supposed, passes %0ainto the animal’s body, as it gradually loses its health, and %0ait mostly dies. %0a%0a(6.) Affections of the lungs are cured by using mice, those of %0aAfrica more particularly, the animal being skinned and boiled %0ain salt and oil, and then taken with the food. The same pre¬ %0aparation is used also, for the cure of purulent or bloody ex¬ %0apectorations. %0a%0aCHAP. 15.-REMEDIES FOR PAINS IN THE STOMACH. %0a%0aODe of the very best remedies for affections of the stomach, %0ais to use a snail diet. 80 They must first be left to simmer in %0awater for some time, without touching the contents of the %0ashell, after which, without any other addition, they must be %0agrilled upon hot coals, and eaten with wine and garum ; 81 the %0asnails of Africa being the best of all for the purpose. The %0aefficacy of this remedy has been proved in numerous instances %0aof late. Another point, too, to be observed, is to take an un¬ %0aeven number of them. Snails, however, have a juice, it should %0ahe remembered, which imparts to the breath an offensive smell. %0a%0a77 See Horace, Epode xii. 1. 5. %0a%0a78 Hence, perhaps, the practice of nursing lap-dogs. %0a%0a70 See B. iii. c. 30, and Note 2, p. 267. %0a%0aso J n France and Italy, snails are considered a delicacy by some.

The most esteemed kinds %0aof all are those of Africa—those which come from Iol, 82 in %0aparticular—of Astypalaea, and, after them, those of JEtna, in %0aSicily, those I mean of moderate size, for the large ones are %0ahard, and destitute of juice. The Balearic snails, called “ca- %0avaticae,” from being found in caverns, are much esteemed; and %0aso, too, are those from the islands of Capreae. 83 Those of Greece, %0aon the other hand, are never used for food, either old or %0afresh. %0a%0aIliver snails, and those with a white shell, have a strong, %0arank, juice, and forest snails are by no means good for the %0astomach, having a laxative effect upon the bowels; the same, %0atoo, with all kinds of small snails. Sea-snails, 84 on the other %0ahand, are more beneficial to the stomach; but it is for pains %0ain that region that the) 1, are found the most efficacious: the %0abest plan, it is said, is to eat them alive, of whatever kind %0athey may happen to be, with vinegar. In addition to these, %0athere are the snails called “ aceratoe,” 85 with a bi’oad shell, and %0afound in numerous localities: of the uses to which they arc %0aput we shall 86 speak further on the appropriate occasions. The %0acraw of poultry, dried and sprinkled in the drink, or else used %0afresh and grilled, has a soothing effect upon pectoral catarrhs %0aand coughs attended with phlegm. 87 Snails, beaten up raw %0aand taken in three cyathi of warm water, allay cough.

Some persons grill one sextarius of these insects on a %0aflat pan, till they become white, and then mix them with %0ahoney. There are some authorities who call this insect a %0a“centipede,” and recommend it to be given in warm water. %0aSnails are administered to persons subject to fainting fits, %0aalienation of the senses, and vertigo : for which purposes, a %0asnail is beaten up, shell and all, with three cyathi of raisin %0awine, and the mixture is administered warm with the drink, %0afor nine days at most. Others, again, give-one snail the first %0aday, two the second, three the third, two the fourth, and one %0athe fifth; a mode of treatment also adopted for the cure of %0aasthma and of abscesses. %0a%0aThere is, according to some authorities, an insect resem¬ %0abling the locust in appearance, destitute of wings, and known %0aby the Greek name of “ troxallis,” it being without a name in %0aLatin: a considerable number of writers, however, consider %0ait as identical with the insect known to us as “ gryllus.” 89 %0aTwenty of these insects, they say, should be grilled, and taken %0ain honied wine, by patients troubled with hardness of breath¬ %0aing or spitting of blood. Some persons pour pure grape-juice, 90 %0aor sea-water, upon unwashed snails, and then boil and eat %0athem for food; or else they bruise tbe snails, shells and all, %0aand take them with this grape-juice. A similar method is %0aalso adopted for the cure of cough. Honey in which the bees %0ahave died, is particularly good for the cure of abscesses. For %0aspitting of blood a vulture’s lungs are used, burnt upon vine %0alogs, and mixed with half the quantity of pomegranate blos¬ %0asoms, or with the same proportion of quince and lily blossom : %0athe whole being taken morning and evening, in wine, if there %0ais no fever ; but where there are symptoms of lever, instead of %0awine, water is used in which quinces have been boiled. %0a%0aCHAP. 17.-REMEDIES FOR AFFECTIONS OF THE SPLEEN. %0a%0aAccording to the prescriptions given by the magicians, a %0afresh sheep’s milt is the best application for pains in the spleen, %0aihe person who applies it uttering these words: “ I his I do %0a%0a88 See c. 12 of this Book. . %0a%0a89 Our “ cricket.” The troxallis was probably a kind of locust, still %0aknown to naturalists by that name. %0a%0aso o Protropum.” "Wine of the first running. %0a%0a%0a440 %0a%0a%0aPLINY’S NATURAL niSTORT. %0a%0a%0a[Book XXX. %0a%0a%0afor the cure of the spleen.” This done, it is enjoined that the %0amilt should be covered up with mortar in the wall of the %0apatient’s sleeping-room, and sealed with a ring, a charm 91 being %0arepeated thrice nine times. A dog’s milt, removed from the %0aanimal while still alive, taken with the food, is a cure for dis¬ %0aeases of the spleen : some, again, attach it fresh to that part %0aof the patient’s body. Others give the patient—without his %0aknowing it—the milt of a puppy two days old, to eat, in %0asquill vinegar ; the milt, too, of a hedge-hog is similarly %0aused. Ashes of burnt snails are employed, in combination %0awith linseed, nettle-seed, and honey, the treatment being per¬ %0asisted in till the patient is thoroughly cured. %0a%0aA green lizard has a remedial effect, suspended alive in an %0aearthen vessel, at the entrance of the sleeping-room of the %0apatient, who, every time he enters or leaves it, must take care %0ato touch it with his hand : the head, too, of a horned owl, re¬ %0aduced to ashes and incorporated with an unguent; honey, also, %0ain which the bees have died ; and spiders, the one known as %0athe “ lycos” 92 in particular 1 . %0a%0aCHAP. 18 . —REMEDIES FOR PAINS IN THE SIDE AND IN THE LOINS. %0a%0aFor pains in the side, the heart of a hoopoe is highly es¬ %0ateemed ; ashes, too, of burnt snails, that have been boiled in %0aa ptisan, snails being sometimes applied in the form of a lini¬ %0ament, alone. Potions employed for this purpose have a sprink¬ %0aling in them of the ashes of a mad dog’s skull. For the cure %0aof lumbago, the spotted lizard 93 from beyond seas is used: %0athe head and intestines being first removed, the body is boiled %0ain wine, with half a denarius of black poppy, and the decoc¬ %0ation is taken in drink.

This %0alast is good, too, for the iliac passion, and for inveterate coughs. %0aDysentery is removed also, by taking a spotted lizard from %0abeyond seas, boiled down till the skin only is left, the head, %0afeet, and intestines, being first removed. A couple of snails %0aalso, and an egg, are beaten up, shells and all, in both cases, %0aand made lukewarm in a new vessel, with some salt, three %0acyathi of water, and two cyathi of raisin-wine or date-juice, %0athe decoction being taken in drink. Ashes, too, of burnt snails, %0aare very serviceable, taken in wine with a modicum of resin. %0a%0aThe snails without shells, which we have 95 mentioned as %0abeing mostly found in Africa, are remarkably useful for dy¬ %0asentery, five of them being burnt with half a denarius of gum %0aacacia, and taken, in doses of two spoonfuls, in myrtle wine or %0aany other kind of astringent wine, with an equal quantity of %0awarm water. Some persons employ all kinds of African snails %0aindiscriminately in this manner ; while others, again, make use %0aof a similar number of African snails or broad-shelled snails, %0aas an injection, in preference : in cases, too, where the flux is %0aconsiderable, they add a piece of gum acacia, about the size of %0aa bean. For dysentery and tenesmus, the cast-off slough of a %0asnake is boiled in a pewter vessel with oil of roses: if pre¬ %0apared in any other kind of vessel, it is applied with an instru¬ %0ament made of pewter. Chicken-broth is also used as a remedy %0afor these affections; but the broth of an old cock, strongly %0asalted, acts more powerfully as a purgative upon the bowels. %0aA pullet’s craw, grilled and administered with salt and oil, has %0a%0a95 In B. xxix. c. 36. %0a%0a%0a4-12 %0a%0a%0aplisy’s natural bistort. %0a%0a%0a[Book XXX. %0a%0a%0aa soothing effect upon coeliac affections; but it is absolutely %0anecessary that neither fowl nor patient should have eaten %0acorn 96 for some time before. Pigeons’ dung, also, is grilled and %0ataken in drink. The flesh of a ring-dove, boiled in vinegar, %0ais curative of dysentery and cocliac affections: and for the cure %0aof the former, a thrush is recommended, roasted with myrtle- %0aberries ; a blackbird, also; or honey, boiled, in which the bees %0ahave died. %0a%0aCHAP. 20 .- REMEDIES FOR THE ILIAC PASSION, AND FOR OTHF.K %0a%0aMALADIES OF THE DOWELS. %0a%0aOne of the most dangerous of maladies is that known by the %0aname of “ ileos:” 97 it may be combatted, they say, by tearing %0aa bat asunder, and taking the blood, or by rubbing the abdo¬ %0amen with it. Diarrhoea is arrested more particularly by taking %0asnails, prepared in manner already 98 mentioned for cases of %0aasthma; the ashes, also, of snails burnt alive, administered in %0aastringent wine; the liver of poultry grilled; the dried craw %0aof poultry, a part that is usually thrown away, mixed with %0apoppy-juice—in some cases it is used fresh, grilled, and taken %0ain wine—partridge broth ; the craw of partridges beaten up by %0aitself in red wine ; a wild ringdove boiled in oxycrate ; a sheep’s %0amilt, grilled and beaten up in wine; or else pigeons’ dung, %0aapplied with honey. The crop of an ossifrage, dried and taken %0ain drink, is remarkably useful for patients whose digestion is %0aimpaired—indeed, its good effects may be felt if they only hold %0ait in the hand while eating. Hence it is that some persons %0awear it attached to the body as an amulet; a practice which %0amust not be too long continued, it being apt to cause a wasting %0aof the flesh. The blood, too, of a drake has an astringent %0aeffect. %0a%0aFlatulency is dispelled by eating snails; and griping pains %0ain the bowels, by taking a sheep’s milt grilled, with wine; a %0awild ringdove boiled in oxycrate; the fat of an otis" in wine; or %0athe ashes of an ibis, burnt without the feathers, administered in %0adrink. Another prescription mentioned for griping pains in %0athe bowels is of a very marvellous nature : if a duck, they say, %0ais applied to the abdomen, the malady will pass into the bird, %0a%0a96 See B. xxix. c. 36. 97 The iliac passion, or ileus volvulus. %0a%0a9S In c. 16 of this Book. %0a%0a99 A kind of bustard.

Some recommend, however, that it should be burnt %0ato ashes in a new vessel, feathers and all, and then pounded %0aand taken for four consecutive days, in doses of three spoonfuls, %0ain water. Some say that the heart of this bird should be %0aattached to the thigh, and, according to others, the heart should %0abe swallowed fresh, quite warm, in fact. There is a family %0aof consular dignity, known as the Asprenates, 2 two brothers, %0amembers of which, were cured of colic; the one by eating a %0alark and wearing its heart in a golden bracelet; the other, by %0aperforming a certain sacrifice in a chapel built of raw bricks, %0ain form of a furnace, and then blocking up the edifice the mo¬ %0ament the sacrifice was concluded. The ossifrage has a single %0aintestine only, which has the marvellous property of digesting %0aall that the bird has swallowed: the extremity of this intes¬ %0atine, it is well known, worn as an amulet, is an excellent %0aremedy for colic. %0a%0aThere are certain concealed maladies incident to the intes¬ %0atines, in relation to which there are some marvellous statements %0amade. If to the stomach and chest, more particularly, blind %0apuppies are applied, and suckled with milk from the patient’s %0amouth, 3 the virulence of the malady, it is said, will be trans¬ %0aferred to them, and in the end they will die : on opening %0athem, too, the causes of the malady will be sure to be dis¬ %0acovered. In all such cases, however, the puppies must be %0aallowed to die, and must be buried in the earth. According %0ato what the magicians say, if the abdomen is touched with a %0ahat’s blood, the person will be proof against colic for a whole %0ayear: when a patient, too, is attacked with the pains of colic, %0aif he can bring himself to drink the water in which he has %0awashed his feet, he will experience a cure. %0a%0aCHAP. 21. (8.)-REMEDIES FOR URINARY CALCULI AND %0a%0aAFFECTIONS OF THE BLADDER. %0a%0aFor the cure of urinary calculi, it is a good plan to rub %0a%0a1 See c. 14 of this Book, where a similar notion is mentioned. %0a%0a1 There were three consuls of this name, L. Nonius Asprenas, a.d. 7; %0aL. Nonius Asprenas, a.d. 29; and P. Nonius Asprenas, a.d. 38. They %0aare mentioned also by Suetonius, Tacitus, Dion Cassius, Frontinus, and %0aSeneca. ’ 3 See c. 14 of this Book. %0a%0a%0a444 %0a%0a%0apltny’s natural history. %0a%0a%0a[Book XXX. %0a%0a%0athe abdomen with mouse-dung. The flesh of a hedge-hog is %0aagreeable eating, they sa)', if killed with a single blow upon %0athe head, before it has had time to discharge its urine 3 * upon %0aits body: [persons 4 who eat this flesh, it is said, will never by %0aany possibility suffer from strangury.] The flesh of a hedge¬ %0ahog thus killed, is a cure for urinary obstructions of the blad¬ %0ader; and the same, too, with fumigations made therewith. If, %0aon the other hand, the animal has discharged its urine upon its %0abody, those who eat the flesh will be sure to be attacked by %0astrangury, it is said. As a lithontriptic, 5 earth-worms are %0arecommended, taken in ordinary wine or raisin wine; or else %0aboiled snails, prepared the same way 6 as for the cure of asthma. %0aFor the cure of urinary obstructions, snails are taken from the %0ashells, pounded, and administered in one cyathus of wine, three %0athe first day, two the second, and one the third. For the ex¬ %0apulsion of calculi, the empty shells are reduced to ashes and %0ataken in drink: the liver also of a water-snake, and the ashes %0aof burnt scorpions are similarly employed, or are taken with %0abread or eaten with a locust. For the same purpose, the %0asmall grits that are found in the gizzard of poultry or in the %0acraw of the ringdove, are beaten up and sprinkled in the %0apatient’s drink; the craw, too, of poultry is taken, dried, or if %0afresh, grilled. %0a%0aFor urinary calculi and other obstructions of the bladder, %0adung of ring-doves is taken, with beans; ashes also of wild %0aring-doves’ feathers, mixed with vinegar and honey; the in¬ %0atestines of those birds, reduced to ashes, and administered in %0adoses of three spoonfuls; a small clod from a swallow’s nest, %0adissolved in warm water; the dried crop of an ossifrage; the %0adung of a turtle-dove, boiled in honied wine; or the broth of %0aa boiled turtle-dove. %0a%0aIt is very beneficial also for urinary affections to eat thrushes %0awith myrtle-berries, or grasshoppers grilled on a shallow-pan; %0aor else to take the millepedes, known as “ ouisei,” 7 in drink. %0aFor pains in the bladder, a decoction of lambs’ feet is used. %0a%0a3 * See B. viii. c. 56. %0a%0a4 This passage is omitted by Sillig as an evident interpolation from the %0acontext a couple of lines below. %0a%0a5 The belief in lithontriptics can hardly be said to exist at the present %0aday. Ajasson refers to the grant made by the British Parliament of £5000 %0ato Mrs. Stephens for her lithontriptic! ! %0a%0a6 In c. 16 of this Book. 7 See B. xxix. c. 39. %0a%0a%0aChap. 22.] REMEDIES FOR THE GENERATIVE ORGANS. 445 %0a%0aChicken-broth relaxes the bowels and mollifies acridities; %0aswallows’ dung, too, with honey, employed as a suppository, %0aacts as a purgative. %0a%0aCIIAF. 22.-REMEDIES FOR DISEASES OF THE FUNDAMENT AND OF %0a%0aTHE GENERATIVE ORGANS. %0a%0aThe most efficacious remedies for diseases of the rectum are %0awool-grease—to which some add pompholix 8 and oil of roses— %0aa dog’s head reduced to ashes; or a serpent’s slough, with %0avinegar. In cases where there are chaps and fissures ot those %0aparts, the ashes of the white portion of dogs’ dung are used, %0amixed with oil of roses ; a prescription due, they say, to iEscu- %0alapius, 9 and remarkably efficacious also for the removal of %0awarts. Ashes of burnt mouse-dung, swan’s fat, and cow %0asuet, are also used. Procidence of the rectum is reduced by an %0aapplication of the juices discharged by snails when punctured. %0aFor the cure of excoriation of those parts, ashes of burnt wood- %0amice are used, with honey; the gall of a hedge-bog, with a %0abat’s brains and bitches’ milk ; goose-grease, with the brains of %0athe bird, alum, and wool-grease; or else pigeons’ dung, mixed %0awith honey. A spider, the head and legs being first removed, %0ais remarkably good as a friction for condylomata. To prevent %0athe acridity of the humours from fretting the flesh, goose- %0agrease is applied, with Punic wax, white lead, and oil of %0aroses; swan’s grease also, which is said to be a cure for piles. %0a%0aA very good thing, they say, lor sciatica, is, to pound raw %0asnails in Aminean 10 wine, and to take them with pepper; to %0aeat a green lizard, the feet, head, and intestines being fiist %0aremoved; or to eat a spotted lizard, with the addition ot three %0aoboli of black poppy. Ruptures and convulsions are treated %0awith sheep’s gall, diluted with woman’s milk. The gravy which %0aescapes from a ram’s lights roasted, is used for the cure ot %0aitching pimples and warts upon the generative ^oigans. tor %0aother affections of those parts, the ashes of a ram s wool, un¬ %0awashed even, are used, applied with water; the suet ot a %0asheep’s caul, and of the kidneys more particularly, mixed with %0aashes of pumice-stone and salt; greasy wool, app led. with cold %0awater; sheep’s flesh, burnt to ashes, and applied with water; %0a%0a8 See B. xxxiv. c. 33. 9 It can hardly be said to add to his fame. %0a%0a10 Sec B. xiv. c. 4. %0a%0a%0a446 %0a%0a%0apliny’s natural distort. %0a%0a%0a[Rook XXX. %0a%0a%0aa mule’s hoofs, burnt to ashes; or the powder of pounded %0ahorse teeth, sprinkled upon the parts. In cases ot decidence %0aof either of the testes, an application of the slime discharged %0aby snails is remedial, they say. For the treatment of sordid %0aor running ulcers of those parts, the fresh ashes of a burnt %0adog’s head are found highly useful; the small, broad kind of %0asnail, beaten up in vinegar ; a snake’s slough, or the ashes of %0ait, applied in vinegar; honey in which the bees have died, %0amixed with resin; or the kind of snail without a shell, that is %0afound in Africa, as already 11 mentioned, beaten up with pow¬ %0adered frankincense and white of eggs, the application being %0arenewed at the end of thirty days; some persons, however, %0asubstitute a bulb for the frankincense. %0a%0aFor the cure of hydrocele, a spotted lizard, they say, is %0amarvellously good, the head, feet, and intestines being first %0aremoved, and the rest of the body roasted and taken frequently %0awith the food. For incontinence' 2 of urine dogs’ fat is used, %0amixed with a piece of split alum the size of a bean; ashes, %0aalso, of African snails burnt with the shells, taken in drink ; %0aor else the tongues of three geese roasted and eaten with the %0afood, a remedy which we owe to Anaxilaiis. Mutton-suet, 13 %0amixed with parched salt, has an aperient effect upon inflam¬ %0amatory tumours, and mouse-dung, mixed with powdered %0afrankincense and sandarach, acts upon them as a dispellent: %0athe ashes, also, of a burnt lizard, or the lizard itself, split %0aasunder and applied; or else bruised millepedes, mixed with one %0athird part of turpentine. Some make use of earth of Sinope 14 %0afor this purpose, mixed with a bruised snail. Ashes of %0aempty snail-shells burnt alone, mixed with wax, possess cer¬ %0atain repercussive properties ; the same, too, with pigeons’ dung, %0aemployed by itself, or applied with oat-meal or barley-meal. %0aCantharides, mixed with lime, remove inflammatory tumours %0aquite as effectually as the lancet; and small snails, applied %0atopically with honey, have a soothing effect upon tumours in %0athe groin. %0a%0a11 In B. xxix. c. 36 and in c. 10 of this Book. %0a%0a12 See B. xxxii. c. 35. %0a%0a13 Ajasson remarks that this may probably be useful. %0a%0a11 See B. xxxv. cc. 12, 13. %0a%0a%0aChap. 23.] REMEDIES FOR DISEASES OF THE FEET. %0a%0a%0a447 %0a%0a%0aCHAT. 23. (9.)-REMEDIES FOR GOUT AND FOR DISEASES OF THE %0a%0aFEET. %0a%0aTo prevent varicose veins, the legs of children are rubbed %0awith a lizard’s blood : but both the party who operates and the %0apatient must be fasting at the time. Wool-grease, mixed with %0awoman’s milk and white lead, has a soothing effect upon gout; %0athe liquid dung also voided by sheep; a sheep’s lights; a %0arain’s gall, mixed with suet; mice, split asunder and applied; %0aa weasel’s blood, used as a liniment with plantago; the ashes %0aof a weasel burnt alive, mixed with vinegar and oil of roses, %0aand applied with a feather, or used in combination with wax %0aand oil of roses; a dog’s gall, due care being taken not to touch %0ait with the hand, and to apply it with a feather ; poultry dung; %0aor else ashes of burnt earth-worms, applied with honey, and %0aremoved at the end of a couple of days. Some, however, pre¬ %0afer using this last with water, while others, again, apply the %0aworms themselves, in the proportion of one acetabulum 15 to %0athree cyathi of honey, the feet of the patient being first anointed %0awith oil of roses. The broad, flat, kind of snail, taken in drink, %0ais used for the removal of pains in the feet and joints ; two of %0athem being pounded for the purpose and taken in wine. They %0aare employed, also, in the form of a liniment, mixed with the %0ajuice of the plant helxine: 16 some, however, are content to %0abeat up the snails with vinegar. Some say that salt, burnt %0ain a new earthen vessel with a viper, and taken repeatedly, is %0acurative of gout, and that it is an excellent plan to rub the %0afeet with viper’s fat. It is asserted, too, that similar results %0aare produced by keeping a kite till it is dry, and then powder¬ %0aing it and taking it in water, a pinch in three fingers at a %0atime ; by rubbing the feet with the blood of that bird mixed %0awith nettles; or by bruising the first feathers of a ring-dove %0awith nettles. The dung of ring-doves is used as a liniment %0afor pains in the joints; the ashes also of a burnt weasel, oi %0aof burnt snails, mixed with amylum 17 or gum tragacanth. %0a%0aA very excellent cure for contusions of the joints is a spider's %0aweb ; but there are persons who give the preference to ashes %0aof burnt cobwebs or of burnt pigeons’ dung, mixed with %0apolenta and white wine. Tor sprains of the joints a sovereign %0a%0a15 “ Acetabuli mensura ” seems a preferable reading to “ aceto mensura,” %0a%0awhich makes no sense. ... %0a%0a16 See li. sxi. c. 56. 1 See xuu ' c - 17. %0a%0a%0a448 %0a%0a%0aPLINY'S NATURAL HI3T0RY. %0a%0a%0a[Book XXX. %0a%0a%0aremedy is mutton suet, mixed with the ashes of a woman’s hair; %0aa good application, too, for chilblains is mutton suet, mixed %0awith alum, or else ashes of a burnt dog’s head or of burnt %0amouse-dung. Ulcers, free from discharge, are brought to cica¬ %0atrize by using the above-named substances in combination with %0awax ; ashes, also, of burnt dormice, mixed with oil; ashes of %0aburnt wood-mice, mixed with honey; ashes of burnt earth¬ %0aworms, applied with old oil; or else ashes of the snails without %0aa shell that are so commonly found. All ulcers on the feet are %0acured by the application of ashes of snails, burnt alive; and %0afor excoriations of the feet, ashes of burnt poultry-dung are %0aused, or ashes of burnt pigeons’ dung, mixed with oil. When %0athe feet have been galled by the shoes, the ashes of an old shoe- %0asole are used, or the lights of a lamb or ram. For gatherings %0abeneath 18 the nails, a horse’s tooth, powdered, is a sovereign %0aremedy. A light application of a green lizard’s blood, will %0acure the feet of man or beast when galled beneath. %0a%0aFor the removal of corns upon the feet, the urine of a mule %0aof either sex is applied, mixed with the mud which it has %0aformed upon the ground; sheep’s dung, also; the liver of a %0agreen lizard, or the blood of that animal, applied in wool; %0aearth-worms, mixed with oil; the head of a spotted lizard, %0apounded with an equal quantity of vitex and mixed with oil; %0aor pigeons’ dung, boiled with vinegar. For the cure of all kinds %0aof warts, dogs’ urine is applied fresh, with the mud which it %0ahas formed upon the ground ; dogs’ dung, also, reduced to ashes %0aand mixed with wax; sheep’s dung; the blood of mice, ap¬ %0aplied fresh, or the body of a mouse, split asunder ; the gall of %0aa hedgehog; a lizard’s head or blood, or the ashes of that %0aanimal, burnt entire; the cast-off slough of a snake; or else %0apoultry dung, applied with oil and nitre. Cantharides, also, %0abruised with Taminian 19 grapes, act corrosively upon warts: %0abut when warts have been thus removed, the remedies should %0abe employed which we have pointed out for ulcerations on the %0askin. %0a%0aCHAP. 24. (10.)-REMEDIES FOR EVILS WHTCH ARE LIABLE TO %0a%0aAFFECT THE WHOLE BODY. %0a%0aWe will now turn our attention to those evils which are a %0a%0a18 “ Subluviem.” The same, probably, as the disease of the fingers which %0ahe elsewhere calls “ paronychia,” and perhaps identical with whitlow. %0a%0a19 See B. xxiii. c. 13. %0a%0a%0aChap. 25.] REMEDIES FOE COLD SHIVERIKGS. 449 %0a%0acause of apprehension, as affecting the whole body. According %0ato what the magicians say, the gall of a male black dog is a %0acounter-charm for the whole of a house; and it will be quite suffi¬ %0acient to make fumigations with it, or to use it as a purification, %0ato ensure its preservation against all noxious drugs and pre¬ %0aparations. They say the same, too, with reference to a dog’s %0ablood, if the walls are sprinkled with it; and the genitals of %0athat animal, if buried beneath the threshold. This will sur¬ %0aprise persons the less who are aware how highly these same %0amagicians extol that most abominable insect, the tick, and %0aall because it is the only one that has no 20 passage for the %0aevacuations, its eating ending only in its death, and it living all %0athe longer for fasting : in this latter state it has been known %0ato live so long as seven days, they say, but when it gorges to %0asatiety it will burst in a much shorter period. According to %0athese authorities, a tick from a dog’s left ear, worn as an %0aamulet, will allay all kinds of pains. They presage, too, from %0ait on matters of life and death ; for if the patient, they say, %0agives an answer to a person who has a tick about him, and, %0astanding at the foot of the bed, asks how he is, it is an infal¬ %0alible sign that he will survive ; while, on the other hand, if he %0amakes no answer, he will be sure to die. They add, also, that %0athe dog from whose left ear the tick is taken, must be entirely %0ablack. Mgidius has stated in his writings that dogs will %0aavoid the presence all day of a person who has taken a tick %0afrom off a hog. %0a%0aThe magicians likewise assure us that patients suffering %0afrom delirium will recover their reason on being sprinkled %0awith a mole’s blood; and that persons who are apt to be %0atroubled by the gods of the night 21 and by Fuuni, will expe¬ %0arience relief by rubbing themselves morning and evening -with %0athe tongue, eyes, gall, and intestines of a dragon, 22 boiled in %0aoil, and cooled in the open air at night. %0a%0aCHAP. 25.-REMEDIES FOR COLD SHIVERIXGS. %0a%0aA remedy for cold shiverings, according to Meander, is a %0adead amphisbaena, 23 or its skin only, attached to the body: in %0aaddition to which, he informs us that if one of these reptiles %0a%0a20 A popular fallacy of Pliny's time.

For %0aso it is, that this is the only one among all the serpents that %0afaces the cold, making its appearance the first of all, and even %0abefore the cuckoo’s note is heard. There is another marvellous %0afact also mentioned, wfith reference to the cuckoo : if, upon the %0aspot where a person hears this bird for the first time, he traces %0around the space occupied by his right foot and then digs %0aup the earth, it will effectually prevent fleas from breeding, %0awherever it is thrown. %0a%0aCHAP. 26.-REMEDIES FOR PARALYSIS. %0a%0aFor persons apprehensive of paralysis the fat of dormice and %0aof field-mice, they say, is very useful, boiled : and for patients %0athreatened with phthisis, millepedes are good, taken in drink, %0ain manner already 24 mentioned for the cure of quinzy. The %0asame, too, with a green lizard, boiled down to one cyathus in %0athroe sextarii of wine, and taken in doses of one spoonful %0adaily, until the patient is perfectly cured; the ashes also of %0aburnt snails, taken in wine. %0a%0aCIIAP. 27.-REMEDIES FOR EPILEPSY. %0a%0aFor the cure of epilepsy -wool-grease is used, with a modi¬ %0acum of myrrh, a piece about the size of a hazel-nut being dis¬ %0asolved and taken after the bath, in two cyathi of wine: a %0aram’s testes, also, dried and pounded, and taken in doses of %0ahalf a denarius, in water, or in a semi-sextarius of asses’ %0amilk; the patient being forbidden wine five days before and %0aafter using the remedy. Sheep’s blood, too, is mightily praised, %0ataken in drink ; sheep’s gall, also, and lambs’ gall in particular, %0amixed with honey; the flesh of a sucking puppy, taken with %0awine and myrrh, the head and feet being first removed ; the %0acallosities from a mule’s legs, taken in three cyathi of oxymel; %0athe ashes of a spotted lizard from beyond seas, taken in vine¬ %0agar ; the thin coat of a spotted lizard, which it casts like a %0asnake, taken in drink—indeed some persons recommend the %0alizard itself, gutted with a reed and dried and taken in drink; %0awhile others, again, are for roasting it on a wooden spit and %0ataking it with the food. %0a%0aIt is worth while knowing how the winter slough of this %0a21 In c. 12 of this Book. Woodlicc aro meant. %0a%0a%0aChap. 27.] %0a%0a%0aREMEDIES FOR EPILEPST. %0a%0a%0a451 %0a%0a%0alizard is obtained when it casts it off, before it has had the oppor¬ %0atunity of devouring 25 it; there being no creature, it is said, that %0aresorts iu its spite to more cunning devices for the deception of %0aman; a circumstance owing to which, the name of “stellio” 26 %0ahas been borrowed as a name of reproach. The place to which %0ait retires in summer is carefully observed, being generally some %0aspot beneath the projecting parts of doors or windows, or else %0ain vaults or tombs. In the early days of spring, cages made %0aof split reeds are placed before these spots ; and the narrower %0athe interstices the more delighted is the animal with them, %0ait being all the better enabled thereby to disengage itself of %0athe coat which adheres to its body and impedes its freedom of %0aaction: when, however, it has once quitted it, the construc¬ %0ation of the cage prevents its return. There is nothing what¬ %0aever preferred to this lizard as a remedy for epilepsy. The %0abrains of a weasel are also considered very good, dried and %0ataken in drink ; the liver, too, of that animal, or the testes, %0auterus, or paunch, dried and taken with coriander, in manner %0aalready 27 mentioned; the ashes also of a burnt weasel; or a %0awild weasel, eaten whole with the food. All these properties %0aare equally attributed to the ferret. A green lizard is some¬ %0atimes eaten, dressed with seasonings to stimulate the appetite, %0athe feet and head being first removed ; the ashes, too, of burnt %0asnails are used, as an ointment, with linseed, nettle-seed, and %0ahoney. %0a%0aThe magicians think highly of a dragon’s tail, attached to %0athe body, with a deer’s sinews, in the skin of a gazelle; as %0aalso the small grits found in the crops of young swallows, %0atied to the left arm of the patient; for swallows, it is said, give %0asmall stones to their young the moment they are hatched. %0aIf, at the commencement of the first paroxysm, an epileptic %0apatient eats the first of a swallow’s brood that has been %0ahatched, he will experience a perfect cure: but at a later %0aperiod the disease is treated by using swallow’s blood with %0afrankincense, or by eating the heart of the bird quite ti’esh. %0aKay, even more than this, a small stone taken, from a %0aswallow's nest will relieve the patient the moment it is ap¬ %0aplied, they say; worn, too, as au amulet, it will alwaj s act as %0a%0a%0a25 See B. viii. c. 49. . %0a%0a2j A cozener, cheat, or rogue.

Some recommend the breast of this bird %0ato be taken in drink from a cup made of cerrus 28 wood, or the %0atestes of'a dunghill cock to be taken in milk and water; the %0apatient abstaining from wine the five preceding days, and the %0atestes being dried for the purpose.

I should be inclined, %0atoo, to rank the ashes of the eyes of a horned owl in the num¬ %0aber of those monstrous prescriptions with which the adepts in %0athe magic art abuse the credulity of mankind. %0a%0aIt is in cases, too, of fever, more particularly, that the ac¬ %0aknowledged rules of medicine run counter to the prescriptions %0aof these men: for they have classified the various modes of %0atreating the disease in accordance with the twelve signs of the %0aZodiac, and relatively to the revolutions of the sun and moon, %0aa system which deserves to be utterly repudiated, as I shall %0aprove by a few instances selected from many. They recom¬ %0amend, for example, when the sun is passing through Gemini, %0athat the patient should be rubbed with ashes of the burnt %0acombs, ears, and claws of cocks, beaten up and mixed with %0aoil. If, again, it is the moon that is passing through that %0asign, it is the spurs and wattles of cocks that must he simi¬ %0alarly employed. When either of these luminaries is passing %0athrough Virgo, grains of barley must be used; and when %0athrough Sagittarius, a bat’s wings. When the moon is pass¬ %0aing through Leo, it is leaves of tamarisk that must be employed, %0aand of the cultivated tamarisk, they add: if, again, the sign %0ais Aquarius, the patient must use an application of box-wood %0acharcoal, pounded. %0a%0aOf the remedies, however, that we find recommended by %0athem, I shall be careful to insert those only the efficacy %0aof which has been admitted, or, at least, is probable in any %0adegree; such, for instance, as the use of powerful odours, as %0aan excitant for patients suffering from lethargy ; among which, %0aperhaps, may be reckoned, the dried testes of a weasel, or the %0aliver of that animal, burnt. They consider it a good plan, %0atoo, to attach a sheep’s lights, made warm, round the head of %0athe patient. %0a%0a%0a%0aCHAP. 30. -REMEDIES FOR FEVERS. %0a%0a%0aIn the treatment of quartan fevers, clinical medicine is, so to %0asay, pretty nearly powerless; for which reason we shall insert %0aa considerable number of remedies recommended by professors %0aof the magic art, and, first of all, those prescribed to be worn %0aas amulets : the dust, for instance, in which a hawk has bathed %0a%0a%0a454 %0a%0a%0apuny’s natural history. %0a%0a%0a[Book XXX. %0a%0a%0aitself, tied up in a linen cloth, with a red string, and attached %0ato the body; the longest tooth of a black dog; or the wasp %0aknown by the name of “ pseudosphex,” 3 ' which is always to %0abe seen flying alone, caught with the left hand and attached %0abeneath the patient’s chin. Some use for this purpose the %0aflrst wasp that a person sees in the current year. Other %0aamulets are, a viper’s head, severed from the body and wrapped %0ain a linen cloth; a viper’s heart, removed from the reptile %0awhile still alive ; the muzzle 33 of a mouse and the tips ot its %0aears, wrapped in red cloth, the animal being set at liberty %0aafter they are removed ; the right eye plucked from a living %0alizard, and enclosed with the head, separated from the body, %0ain goat's skin ; the scarabaeus also that forms pellets 34 and rolls %0athem along. %0a%0aIt is on account of this kind of scarabaeus that the people %0aof a great part of Egypt worship those insects as divinities; %0aan usage for which Apion gives a curious reason, asserting, as be %0adoes, by way of justifying the rites of his nation, that the insect %0ain its operations pictures the revolution of the suruy There is %0aalso another kind of scarabaeus, which the magicians recom¬ %0amend to be worn as an amulet—the one that has small horns 3 * %0athrown backwards; it must be taken up, when used for this %0apurpose, with the left hand. A third kind also, known by the %0aname of “ fullo,” 37 and covered with white spots, they recom¬ %0amend to be cut asunder and attached to either arm, the other %0akinds being worn upon the left arm. Other amulets recom¬ %0amended by them, are, the heart of a snake taken from the %0aliving animal with the left hand; or four joints of a scorpion’s %0atail, together with the sting, attached to the body in a piece of %0ablack cloth; due care being taken that the patient does not see %0a%0a32 “ Bastard-wasp.” %0a%0a33 “ Rostellum.” Holland renders it “ The little prettie snout’s end of %0aa mouse.” %0a%0a34 Of cowdung. It was supposed that there was no female scarabaeus, %0aand that the male insect formed these balls for the reproduction of its %0aspecies. It figures very largely in the Egyptian mythology and philosophy %0aas the emblem of the creative and generative power. It has been suggested %0athat its Coptic name “ akalouks” is a compound Sanscrit word, signifying %0a—“ The ox-insect that collects dirt into a round mass.” See B. xi, c. 34. %0a%0a36 Probably the “ lucanus ” mentioned in B. xi. c. 34; supposed to be %0athe same as the stag-beetle. %0a%0a37 The “ fuller,” apparently. This name may possibly be derived, how¬ %0aever, from the Greek %3cpv\\bv, a “ leaf.” %0a%0a%0aChap. 30.] %0a%0a%0aREMEDIES FOR FEVERS. %0a%0a%0a455 %0a%0a%0athe scorpion, which is set at liberty after the operation, or %0athe person wha has attached the amulet, for the space of %0athree days : after the recurrence, too, of the third paroxysm, %0ahe must bury the whole in the ground. Some enclose a cater¬ %0apillar in a piece of linen with a thread passed three times %0around it, and tie as many knots, repeating at each knot why it %0ais that the patient performs that operation. A slug is some¬ %0atimes wrapped in a piece of skin, or the heads of four slugs, %0acut from the body with a reed : a millepede is rolled up in %0awool: the small grubs that produce the gadfly, 38 are used %0abefore the wings of the insect are developed ; or any other kind %0aof hairy grub is employed that is found adhering to prickly %0ashrubs. Some persons attach to the body four of these grubs, %0aenclosed in an empty walnut shell, or else some of the snails %0athat are found without a shell. %0a%0aIn other cases, again, it is the practice to enclose a spotted %0alizard in a little box, and to place it beneath the pillow of the %0apatient, taking care to set it at liberty when the fever abates. %0aIt is recommended also, that the patient should swallow the %0aheart of a sea-diver, removed from the bird without the aid of %0airon, it being first dried and then bruised and taken in warm %0awater. The heart of a swallow is also recommended, with %0ahoney; and there are persons who say that, just before the %0aparoxysms come on, the patient should take one drachma of %0aswallow’s dung in three cyathi of goats’ milk or ewes’ milk, %0aor of raisin wine : others, again, are of opinion that the birds %0athemselves should be taken, whole. The nations of Parthia, %0aas a remedy for quartan fevers, take the skin of the asp, in %0adoses of one sixth of a denarius, with an equal quantity of %0apepper. The philosopher Chrysippus has left a statement to %0athe effect, that the phryganion, 39 worn as an amulet, is a %0aremedy for quartan fevers; but what kind of animal this is he %0ahas nowhere informed us, nor have I been able to meet with %0aany one who knows. Still, however, I felt myself bound to %0anotice a remedy that was mentioned by an author of such high %0arepute, in case any other person should happen to be more %0asuccessful in his researches. To eat the flesh of a crow, and %0a%0a38 See B. xi. c. 38. . , , , %0a%0a39 Some suppose that this was an insect that lived among dry wood, %0aand derive the name from the Greek %3cppvyavbv.

The %0afilth that adheres to the udders of sheep is productive of a %0asimilar effect, as also the dried flesh of a hedge-hog, taken with %0athe food. Matter vomited by a dog, we are assured, applied %0ato the abdomen, will draw off the water that has accumulated %0athere. %0a%0a%0aCHAP. 32.

Care %0amust be taken also that iron is used for the removal of the %0acricket, with some of the earth about its hole. Goose-grease %0ais also employed for this purpose ; a viper’s head, dried and %0aburnt, and applied with vinegar ; or a serpent’s slough, applied %0ato the body, immediately after the bath, with bitumen and %0alamb suet. %0a%0a40 The “wolf” spider.

A sprinkling of polenta %0aupon the sores is also used. For carbuncles and other sores of %0athe generative organs, wool-grease is used as a remedy, with %0arefuse of lead; and for incipient carbuncles, sheep’s dung is %0aemployed. Tumours and all other affections that stand in need %0aof emollients are treated most effectually with goose-grease; %0athat of cranes, too, is equally efficacious. %0a%0aCHAP. 34.-REMEDIES FOR BOILS. %0a%0aFor boils the following remedies are prescribed'; a spider, %0aapplied before mentioning the insect by name, care being %0ataken to remove it at the end of two days; a shrew-mouse, %0asuspended by the neck till it is dead, care being taken not %0ato let it touch the earth when dead, and to pass it three %0atimes around the boil, both operator and patient spitting on the %0afloor each time; poultry-dung, that of a red colour in particular, %0aapplied fresh with vinegar; the crop of a stork, boiled in wine; %0aflies, an uneven number of them, rubbed upon the patient with %0athe ring 43 finger ; the filth from sheep’s ears; stale mutton %0asuet, with ashes of women’s hair; ram suet also, with ashes of %0aburnt pumice and an equal quantity of salt. %0a%0aCHAP. 35.-REMEDIES FOR BURNS. %0a%0aFor burns, the ashes of a dog’s head are used; ashes of %0aburnt dormice, with oil; sheep’s dung, with wax; ashes also %0aof burnt snails, an application so effectual, as not to leave a %0a6careven.

A serpent’s slough, attached to the patient’s body in %0aa piece of bull’s hide, is a preventive of spasms: and the dried %0aliver of a kite, taken in doses of three oboli, in three cyathi %0aof hydromel, is a preservative agaiust opisthotony. %0a%0aCHAP. 37. -REMEDIES FOR MALADIES OF THE NAILS AND FINGERS. %0a%0aAgnails and hangnails upon the fingers are removed by %0ausing the ashes of a burnt dog’s head, or the uterus of a bitch %0aboiled in oil, the fingers being first rubbed with a liniment of %0aewe-milk butter, mixed with honey. The gall-bladder, too, of %0aany animal is very useful for this purpose. Malformed nails %0aare healed with an application of cantharides and pitch, which %0ais removed at the end of two days ; or else with locusts fried %0awith he-goat suet; or with an application of mutton suet. Some %0amix mistletoe and purslain with these ingredients; while %0aothers, again, use verdigrease and mistletoe, removing the appli¬ %0acation at the end of two days. %0a%0aCHAP. 38. (13.) —METHODS FOR ARRESTING HAEMORRHAGE. %0a%0aBleeding at the nostrils is arrested by mutton suet taken %0afrom the caul, introduced into the nostrils; by drawing up %0arennet, lamb’s rennet in particular, mixed with water, into the %0anostrils, or by using it as an injection, a remedy which succeeds %0aeven where other remedies have failed; by making up goose- %0agrease into a bolus with an equal quantity of butter, and %0aplugging the nostrils with it; or by using the earth that %0aadheres to snails, or else the snails themselves, extracted from %0athe shell. Excessive discharges from the nostrils are arrested %0aalso by applying crushed snails, or cobwebs, to the forehead. %0aFor issues of blood from the brain, the blood or brains of %0apoultry are used, as also pigeons’ dung, thickened and kept %0afor the purpose. In cases where there is an immoderate flow %0aof blood from a wound, an application of horse-dung, burnt %0awith egg-shells, is marvellously good for stopping it. %0a%0aCHAP. 39. —REMEDIES FOR ULCEROUS SORES AND WOUNDS. %0a%0aFor the cure of ulcers, wool-grease is used, with ashes of %0a%0a%0aChap.

Very considerable, too, is the efficacy of lights, %0aram’s lights in particular, which are of the greatest utility tor %0areducing and making level the fleshy excrescences formed by %0aulcerous sores. With sheep’s dung, warmed beneath an %0aearthen pan and kneaded, the swellings attendant upon wounds %0aare reduced, and fistulous sores and epinyctis are cleansed and %0amade to heal. %0a%0aBut it is in the ashes of a burnt dog s head that the %0agreatest efficacy is found; as it quite equals spodiunfl 3 in %0aits property of cauterizing all kinds of fleshy excrescences, %0aand causing sores to heal. Mouse-dung, too, is used as a %0acautery, and weasels’ dung, burnt to ashes. Pounded mille¬ %0apedes, mixed with turpentine and earth of Sinope ,' 16 are used %0afor penetrating carcinomata and fleshy indurations in deep- %0aseated sores ; and the same substances are remarkably useful %0afor the treatment of ulcers threatened with maggots. %0a%0aIndeed the several varieties of worms themselves are pos¬ %0asessed of marvellously useful properties. Ihe worms, lor %0ainstance, that breed in wood are curative of all kinds of ulcers : %0areduced to ashes, with an equal quantity of anise, and applied %0awith oil, they heal cancerous sores. Earthworms are so remark¬ %0aably healing for wounds recently inflicted, that it is a very %0ageneral belief that by the end of seven days they will unite %0asinews even that have been cut asunder : hence it is that it is re¬ %0acommended to keep them preserved in honey. Ashes of burnt %0aearth-worms, in combination with tar or Simblian honey, cau¬ %0aterize the indurated margins of ulcerous sores. Some persons dry %0aearthworms in the sun, and apply them to wounds with vinegar, %0athe application not beingremoved till the end of acouple of daj s. %0aThe earth also that adheres to snails is useful, similarly ern- %0a%0a%0a45 See B. xxxiv. c. 34. %0a%0a46 See B. xxxv. cc. 12, 13. %0a%0a47 Dioscorides speaks of this honey %0a%0a%0a*7 “ Cosses.” %0aas the produce of Sicily. %0a%0a%0a4 GO %0a%0a%0apunt’s natural history. %0a%0a%0a[Rook XXX. %0a%0a%0aployed; snails, too, taken whole from the shell, are pounded %0aand applied to fresh wounds, to heal them, and they arrest the %0aprogress of cancerous sores. %0a%0aThere is an insect called “herpes” 49 h)' the Greeks, which %0ais particularly useful for the cure of all kinds of serpiginous 40 %0asores. Snails, beaten up, shells and all, are very good tor this %0apurpose ; and it is said that, with myrrh and frankincense, %0athey will unite the sinews even when cut asunder. The fat, %0atoo, of a dragon, 61 dried in the sun, is remarkably useful, and %0aso are the brains of a cock or capon for recent wounds. By %0ataking with the food salt in Avhich vipers have been preserved, %0aulcers are rendered more easy of treatment, it is said, and are %0amade to heal all the sooner. Antonius 52 the physician, after %0aoperating in vain upon ulcers, that were incurable with the %0aknife, used to prescribe viper’s flesh to be eaten by the patient, %0awhereby a marvellously speedy cure was effected. %0a%0aThe locust called “ troxallis,” 53 reduced to ashes and applied %0awith honey, removes the indurated margins of ulcerous sores: %0aashes, also, of burnt pigeons’ dung, with arsenic and honey, %0aare very effectual in all cases -where a cautery is required. %0aThe brains of a horned owl, applied with goose-grease, are %0amarvellously efficacious for uniting wounds, it is said. For %0athe malignant ulcer known as “ cacoethes,” 64 the ashes of a %0aram’s thigh-bones are used, mixed with woman’s milk, the sores %0abeing washed with linen cloths well rinsed. For the same %0apurpose, the bird known as the screech-owl 55 is boiled in oil, %0aewe-milk butter and honey being added to the preparation, %0awhen properly dissolved. An application of bees that have %0adied in the honey, acts emolliently upon the indurated margins %0aof ulcerous sores; and for the cure of elephantiasis, the blood %0aand ashes of a weasel are employed. Wounds and weals pro¬ %0aduced by blows are effaced by an application of sheep-skins %0afresh from the body. %0a%0achap. 40. —remedies for broken bones. %0a%0aFor fractures of the joints, ashes of sheep’s thigh-bones are %0a%0a49 The “ creeper.” It has not been identified. %0a%0a50 Which are also called “ herpetic ” or “ creeping." %0a%0a51 The serpent so called. %0a%0a62 Antonius Castor, probably.

For broken bones, a %0adog’s brains are used, spread upon a linen cloth, with wool %0alaid upon the surface and moistened every now and then. The %0afractured bone will mostly unite in the course of fourteen %0adays ; and a cure equally expeditious may be effected by using %0athe ashes of burnt field-mice, with honey, or of burnt earth¬ %0aworms ; a substance which is extremely useful for the ex¬ %0atraction of splintered bones. %0a%0aCHAP. 41. —APPLICATIONS FOR CICATRIZATIONS, AND FOR THE %0aCURE OF MORPHEW. %0a%0aCicatrizations are restored to their original colour by apply¬ %0aing sheep’s lights, those of a ram in particular; mutton-suet, %0amixed with nitre ; the ashes of a green lizard; a snake’s slough, %0aboiled in wine; or else pigeons’ dung, mixed with honey ; %0aa preparation which, in combination with wine, is good for %0athe removal of white morphew. For the cure, also, of mor- %0aphew, cantharides are used, with two-thirds of rue-leaves; %0aa preparation which the patient must keep applied, in the sun, %0atill the skin itches and rises in blisters ; after which it must %0abe fomented and well rubbed with oil, and the application re¬ %0apeated. This must be done for several days in succession, due %0aprecautions being taken that the ulcerations do not penetrate %0atoo deep. %0a%0aFor the cure, too, of morphew, a liniment is recommended, %0amade of flies and root of agrimony ; the white part also ot %0apoultry dung, kept in a horn box with stale oil; a bat’s blood ; %0aor else the gall of a hedge-hog applied with water. Itch-scab %0ais cured by using the brains of a horned owl, incorporated with %0asaltpetre; but dog’s blood is the best thing to keep it in %0acheck.

(14.)- REMEDIES FOR FEMALE COMPLAINTS. %0a%0aFor diseases incident to females, a ewe s placenta is very %0auseful, as already 66 mentioned by us, when speaking ot goats: %0asheep’s dung, too, is equally good. A fumigation of burnt %0alocusts, applied to the lower parts, affords relief to strangury, %0ain females more particularly. If, immediately after concep¬ %0ation, a woman eats a cock’s testes every now and then, the %0achild of which she is pregnant will become 67 a male, it is said. %0aThe ashes of a burnt porcupine, taken in drink, are a preventive %0aof abortion : bitches’ milk facilitates delivery: and the after¬ %0abirth of a bitch, provided it has not touched the ground, will %0aact as an expellent of the foetus. Milk, taken as a drink, %0astrengthens the loins of women when in travail. Mouse-dung, %0adiluted with rain water, reduces the breasts of females, when %0aswollen after delivery. The ashes of a burnt hedge-hog, %0aapplied with oil, act as a preventive of abortion. Delivery is %0afacilitated, in cases where the patient has taken, either goose- %0adung in two cyathi of water, or the liquid that escapes from %0athe uterus of a weasel by its genitals. %0a%0aEarth-worms, applied topically, effectually prevent pains in %0athe sinews of the neck and shoulders; taken in raisin wine, %0athey expel the after-birth, when retarded. Applied by them¬ %0aselves, earthworms ripen abscesses of the breasts, open them, %0adraw the humours, and make them cicatrize : taken in honied %0awine, they promote the secretion of the milk. In hay-grass there %0aare small worms found, which, attached to the neck, act as a %0apreventive of premature delivery; they are removed, however, %0aat the moment of childbirth, as otherwise they would have the %0aeffect of impeding delivery; care must be taken, also, not to put %0a56 In B. xxviii. c. 77. 67 “ Fieri.” %0a%0a%0aChap. 44.] METnODS OF FACILITATING DELIVERY. 463 %0a%0athem on the ground. To promote conception, five or seven of %0athem are administered in drink. Snails, taken with the food, %0aaccelerate delivery; and, applied with saffron, they promote %0aconception. Used in the form of a liniment, with amylum 68 %0aand gum tragacanth, they arrest uterine discharges. Taken %0awith the food, they promote menstruation ; and, mixed with %0adeer’s marrow, in the proportion of one denarius and the same %0aquantity of Cyprus 59 to each snail, they reduce the uterus when %0adisplaced. Taken from the shell, and beaten up with oil of %0aroses, they dispel inflations of the uterus; the snails of Asty- %0apalaea being those that are mostly chosen for these purposes. %0a%0aThose of Africa, again, are employed in a different manner, %0atwo of them being beaten up with a pinch of fenugreek in %0athree fingers, and four spoonfuls of honey, and the preparation %0aapplied to the abdomen, after it has been rubbed with juice of %0airis. 60 There is a kind of small, white, elongated snail, 61 that %0ais found stra 5 'ing here and there : dried upon tiles in the sun, %0aand reduced to powder, these snails are mixed with bean-meal, %0ain equal proportions, forming a cosmetic which whitens and %0asoftens the skin. The small, broad, kind of snail, mixed with %0apolenta, is good for the removal of a tendency to scratch and %0arub the skin. %0a%0aIf a pregnant woman steps over a viper, she will be sure to %0amiscarry ; 62 the same, too, in the case of the amphisboena, but %0aonly when it is dead. If, however, a woman carries about her a %0alive amphisbcena in a box, she may step over one with impu¬ %0anity, even though it be dead. An amphisbmna, preserved for %0athe purpose, will ensure an easy delivery, even though it be %0adead. 63 It is a truly marvellous fact, but if a pregnant woman %0asteps over one of these serpents that has not been preserved, it %0awill be perfectly harmless, provided she immediately steps %0aover another that has been preserved. A fumigation made %0awith a dried snake, acts powerfully as an emmenagogue. %0a%0aCHAP. 44. -METHODS OF FACILITATING DELIVERY. %0a%0aThe cast-off slough of a snake, attached to the loins, facili- %0a%0ass See B xviii. c. 17. 69 See B. xii. c. 51. 60 See B. xxi. cc. 19, S3. %0a%0asi y arr0 calls them “ albulne,” and says that they were found at lleate. %0a%0a62 Of course she will he liable to do so, from fright. %0a%0a63 The whole of this account appears to be in a very confused state, and %0ais probably corrupt.

It is administered, too, in wine, mixed %0awith frankincense : taken in any other form, it is productive %0aof abortion. A staff, by the aid of which a person has parted®* %0aa frog from a snake, will accelerate parturition. Ashes of the %0atroxallis, 64 applied with honey, act as an eminenagogue; the %0asame, too, with the spider that descends as it spins its thread %0afrom aloft; it must be taken, however, in the hollow of the %0ahand, crushed, and applied accordingly : if, on the contrary, %0athe spider is taken while ascending, it will arrest menstru¬ %0aation. %0a%0aThe stone aetites, 66 that is found in the eagle’s nest, preserves %0athe foetus against all insidious attempts at producing abortion. %0aA vulture’s feather, placed beneath the feet of the woman, %0aaccelerates parturition. It is a well-known fact, that pregnant %0a"women must be on their guard against ravens’ eggs, for if a %0afemale in that state should happen to step over one, she will %0abe sure to miscarry by the mouth. 67 A hawk’s dung, taken in %0ahonied wine, would appear to render females fruitful. Goose- %0agrease, or that of the swan, acts emolliently upon indurations %0aand abscesses of the uterus. %0a%0aCHAP. 45.- METHODS OF PRESERVING THE BREASTS FROM INJURY. %0a%0aGoose-grease, mixed up with oil of roses and a spider, pro¬ %0atects the breasts after delivery. The people of Phrygia and %0aLycaonia have made the discovery, that the grease of the otis 68 %0ais good for affections of the breasts, resulting from recent de¬ %0alivery : for females affected with suffocations of the uterus, %0athey employ a liniment made of beetles. The shells of par¬ %0atridges’ eggs, burnt to ashes and mixed with cadmia 69 and %0awax, preserve the firmness 70 of the breasts. It is generally %0athought, that if the egg of a partridge or * * * is passed %0athree times round a woman’s breasts, they will never become %0aflaccid; and that, if these eggs are swallowed, they will be %0aproductive of fruitfulness, and promote the plentiful secretion %0a%0a64 Ajasson has wasted ten lines of indignation upon the question where %0asuch a staff is to be found ! %0a%0a65 See c. 16 of this Book. 66 See B. xxxvi. c. 39. %0a%0a67 An impossibility.

It is believed, too, that by anointing a woman’s %0abreasts with goose-grease, pains therein may be allayed ; that %0amoles formed in the uterus may be dispersed thereby; and %0athat itch 71 of the uterus may be dispelled by the application of %0aa liniment made of crushed bugs. %0a%0achap. 46.—various kinds of depilatories. %0a%0aBats’ blood has all the virtues of a depilatory : but if applied %0ato the cheeks of youths, it will not be found sufficiently effica¬ %0acious, unless it is immediately followed up by an application %0aof verdigrease or hemlock-seed; this method having the effect %0aof entirely removing the hair, or at least reducing it to the %0astate of a fine down. It is generally thought, too, that bats’ %0abrains are productive of a similar effect; there being two kinds %0aof these brains, the red and the white. Some persons mix %0awith the brains the blood and liver of the same animal: others, %0aagain, boil down a viper in three semisextarii of oil, and, after %0aboning it, use it as a depilatory, first pulling out the hairs %0athat are wanted not to grow. The gall of a hedgehog is a %0adepilatory, more particularly if mixed with bats’ brains and %0agoats’ milk : the ashes, too, of a burnt hedgehog are used for a %0asimilar purpose. If, after plucking out the hairs that are %0awanted not to grow, or if, before they make their appearance, %0athe parts are well rubbed with the milk of a bitch with her %0afirst litter, no hairs will grow there. The same result is en¬ %0asured, it is said, by using the blood of a tick taken from off a %0adog, or else the blood or gall of a swallow. %0a%0a(15.) Ants’ eggs, they say, beaten up with flies, impart a %0ablack colour 72 to the eyebrows. If it is considered desirable %0athat the colour of the infant’s eyes should be black, the preg¬ %0anant woman must eat a rat. 73 Ashes of burnt earth-worms, %0aapplied with oil, prevent the hair from turning white. %0a%0achap. 47.—remedies for the diseases of infants. %0a%0aFor infants that are troubled with coagulation of the milk, %0aa grand preservative is lamb’s rennet, taken in water; and in %0acases where the milk has so coagulated, it may be remedied %0aby administering rennet in vinegar.

The %0ainflammation called “ siriasis,” 73 * to which infants are liable, is %0acured by attaching to them the bones that are found in the %0adung of dogs. Hernia in infants is cured by letting a green %0alizard bite the child’s body while asleep, after which the lizard %0ais attached to a reed, and hung up in the smoke; by the time %0athe animal dies, the child will bo perfectly cured, it is said. %0aThe slime of snails, applied to the eyes of children, straightens %0athe eyelashes, and makes them grow. Ashes of burnt snails, %0aapplied with frankincense and juice of white grapes, are a cure %0afor hernia [in infants], if applied for thirty days consecutively. %0aWithin the horns 71 of snails, there are certain hard substances %0afound, like grits of sand : attached to infants, they facilitate %0adentition. %0a%0aAshes of empty snail-shells, mixed with wax, are a pre¬ %0aventive of procidence of the rectum ; but they must be used %0ai'l combination with the matter that exudes from a viper’s %0abrains, on the head being pricked. Vipers’ brains, attached to %0athe infant’s body in a piece of skin, facilitate dentition, a simi¬ %0alar effect being produced by using the larger teeth of. serpents. %0aHavens’ dung, attached to an infant with wool, is curative of %0acough. %0a%0aIt is hardly possible to preserve one’s seriousness in describing %0asome of these remedies, but as they have been transmitted to %0aus, I must not pass them in silence. For the treatment of %0ahernia in infants, a lizard is recommended ; but it must be a %0amale lizard, a thing that may be ascertained by its having but %0aone orifice beneath the tail. The method of proceeding, is for %0athe lizard to bite the part affected through cloth of gold, cloth %0aof silver, and cloth dyed purple; after which it is tied fast in a %0acup that has never been used, and smoked. Incontinence of %0aurine in infants is checked by giving them boiled mice 74 with %0atheir food. The large indented horns of the scarabaeus, attached %0ato the bodies of infants, have all the virtues of an amulet. In %0athe head of the boa 76 there is a small stone, they say, which %0athe serpent spits out, when it is in fear of death : if the reptile %0ais taken by surprise, and the head cut off, and this stone ex- %0a%0a73 * Supposed to be an inflammation of the membranes of the brain. %0a%0a74 See c. 8 of this Book. %0a%0a75 A remedy stilll used, Ajasson says, in the French provinces. %0a%0a7 * See B. viii. c. 14, and B. xxix. c. 38. %0a%0a%0aChap. 49.] APHRODISIACS AND ANT APHRODISIACS. 467 %0a%0atracted, it will aid dentition to a marvellous degree, attached %0ato the neck of infants. The brains, too, of the same serpent %0aare recommended to be attached to the body for a similar pur¬ %0apose, as also the small stone or bone that is found in the back %0aof the slug. %0a%0aAn admirable promoter of dentition is found in sheep’s %0abrains, applied to the gums ; and equally good for diseases of %0athe ears, is an application of goose-grease, with juice of ocimum. %0aUpon prickly plants there is found a kind of rough, hairy, %0agrub: attached to the neck of infants, these insects give instant %0arelief, it is said, when any of the food has stuck in the throat. %0a%0aCHAP. 48. -PROVOCATIVES OF SLEEP. %0a%0aAs a soporific, wool-grease is employed, diluted in two %0acyathi of wine with a modicum of myrrh, or else mixed with %0agoose-grease and myrtle wine. For a similar purpose also, a %0acuckoo is attached to the body in a hare’s skin, or a young %0aheron’s bill to the forehead in an ass’s skin : it is thought, too, %0athat the beak alone, steeped in wine, is equally efficacious. On %0athe other hand, a bat’s head, dried and worn as an amulet, acts %0aas a preventive of sleep. %0a%0aCHAr. 49. -APHRODISIACS AND ANTAPHRODISIACS. %0a%0aA lizard drowned in a man’s urine has the effect of an ant- %0aaphrodisiac upon the person whose urine it is; for this animal %0ais to be reckoned among the philtres, the magicians say. The %0asame property is attributed to the excrements of snails, and to %0apigeons’ dung, taken with oil and wine. The right lobe of a %0avulture’s lungs, attached to the body in the skin of a crane, %0aacts powerfully as a stimulant upon males : an effect equally %0aproduced by taking the yolks of five pigeons’ eggs, in honey, %0amixed with one denarius of hog’s lard; sparrows, or eggs of %0asparrows, with the food ; or by wearing the right testicle of a %0acock, attached to the body in a ram’s skin. The ashes of a %0aburnt ibis, it is said, employed as a friction with goose-grease %0aand oil of iris, will prevent abortion when a female has once %0aconceived ; while the testes of a game-cock, on the other hand, %0arubbed with goose-grease and attached to the body in a ram s %0askin, have all the effect of an antaphrodisiac: the same, too, %0awith the testes of any kind of dunghill cock, placed, together %0awith the blood of a cock, beneath the bed.

It is asserted, too, that if the ashes of %0aa burnt weasel are mixed with the cramming for chickens or %0ayoung pigeons, they will be safe from the attacks of weasels. %0aBeasts of burden, when troubled with pains in staling, find %0aimmediate relief, if a bat is attached to tho body ; and they are %0aeffectually cured of bots by passing a ring-dove three times %0around their generative parts—a truly marvellous thing to relate, %0athe ring-dove, on being set at liberty, dies, and the beast is in¬ %0astantly relieved from pain. %0a%0aCHAP. 51.-REMEDIES FOR INTOXICATION. %0a%0aThe eggs of an owlet, administered to drunkards three days %0ain wine, are productive of a distaste for that liquor.

Some authors state that there is a bird in %0aSardinia, resembling the crane and called the “ gromphena ;” 81 %0abut it is no longer known even by the people of that country, %0ain my opinion. In the same province, too, there is the ophion, %0aan animal which resembles the deer in the hair only, and to be %0afound 8 ' 2 nowhere else. The same authors have spoken also of %0athe “ subjugus,” 83 but have omitted to state what animal it is, %0aor where it is to be found. That it did formerly exist, however, %0aI have no doubt, as certain remedies are described as being %0aderived from it. M. Cicero speaks of animals called “biuri,” 84 %0awhich gnaw the vines in Campania. %0a%0aCHAP. 53. (16.)-OTHER MARVELLOUS FACTS CONNECTED WITH %0a%0aANIMALS. %0a%0aThere are still some other marvellous facts related, with %0areference to the animals which we have mentioned. A dog %0awill not bark at a person who has any part of the secundines %0aof a bitch about him, or a hare’s dung or fur. The kind of %0agnats called “ muliones,” 85 do not live more than a single day. %0aPersons when taking honey from the hives, will never be %0atouched by the bees if they carry the beak of a wood-pecker 86 %0aabout them. Swine will be sure to follow the person who has %0agiven them a raven’s brains, made up into a bolus. The dust %0ain which a she-mule has wallowed, sprinkled upon the body, %0awill allay the flames of desire. Eats may be put to flight by %0acastrating a male rat, and setting it at liberty. If a snake s %0aslough is beaten up with some spelt, salt, and wild thyme, and %0aintroduced into the throat of oxen, with wine, at the time %0athat grapes are ripening, they will be in perfect health for a %0awhole year to come : the same, too, if three young swallows are %0agiven to them, made up into three boluses.

(1.)-THE ORIGIN OF THE MAGIC ART. %0a%3c %0a%3c In former parts of this work, I have had occasion more than %0a%3c once, when the subject demanded it, to refute the impostures %0a%3c of the magic art, and it is now my intention to continue still %0a%3c further my exposure thereof. Indeed, there are few subjects %0a%3c on which more might be profitably said, were it only that, %0a%3c being, as it is, the most deceptive of all known arts, it has %0a%3c exercised the greatest influence in every country and in nearly %0a%3c every age. And no one can be surprised at the extent of its %0a%3c influence and authority, when he reflects that by its own ener¬ %0a%3c gies it has embraced, and thoroughly amalgamated with itself, %0a%3c the three other sciences 1 which hold the greatest sway upon %0a%3c the mind of man. %0a%3c %0a%3c That it first originated in medicine, no one entertains a %0a%3c doubt ; 2 or that, under the plausible guise of promoting health, %0a%3c it insinuated itself among mankind, as a higher and more holy %0a%3c brauch of the medical art. Then, in the next place, to pro¬ %0a%3c mises the most seductive and the most flattering, it has added %0a%3c all the resources of religion, a subject upon which, at the pre¬ %0a%3c sent day, man is still entirely in the dark. Last of all, to %0a%3c complete its universal sway, it has incorporated with itself the %0a%3c astrological art ; 3 there being no man who is not desirous to %0a%3c know his future destiny, or who is not ready to believe that %0a%3c this knowledge may with the greatest certainty be obtained, %0a%3c by observing the face of the heavens. The senses of men %0a%3c being thus enthralled by a three-fold bond, the art of magic %0a%3c has attained an influence so mighty, that at the present day %0a%3c even, it holds sway throughout a great part of the world, and %0a%3c rules the kings 4 of kings in the East. %0a%3c %0a%3c 1 “ Artes.” Medicine, religion, and the art of divination. %0a%3c %0a%3c 2 Ajasson remarks that, on the contrary, this is a subject of great doubt. %0a%3c %0a%3c 1 “ Mathematicas artes.” %0a%3c %0a%3c 4 The title of the ancient kings of Persia. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c pliny’s natural history. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XXX. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 422 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 2.-WHEN AND WHERE THE ART OF MAGIC ORIGINATED : %0a%3c %0a%3c BY WHAT PERSONS IT WAS FIRST PRACTISED. %0a%3c %0a%3c There is no doubt that this art originated in Persia,® under %0a%3c Zoroaster, 6 this being a point upon which authors are generally %0a%3c agreed; but whether there was only one Zoroaster, or whether %0a%3c in later times there was a second person of that name, is a %0a%3c matter which still remains undecided. Eudoxus, 7 who has %0a%3c endeavoured to show that of all branches of philosophy the %0a%3c magic art is the most illustrious and the most beneficial, in¬ %0a%3c forms us that this Zoroaster existed six thousand years before %0a%3c the death of Plato, an assertion in which he is supported by %0a%3c Aristotle. Hermippus,® again, an author who has written %0a%3c with the greatest exactness on all particulars connected with %0a%3c this art, and has commented upon the two millions 9 of verses %0a%3c left by Zoroaster, besides completing indexes to his several %0a%3c works, has left a statement, that Agonaces was the name of %0a%3c the master from whom Zoroaster derived his doctrines, and %0a%3c that he lived five thousand years before the time of the Trojan %0a%3c War. The first thing, however, that must strike us with Bur- %0a%3c prise, is the fact that this art, and the traditions connected %0a%3c with it, should have survived for so many ages, all written %0a%3c commentaries thereon having perished in the meanwhile ; and %0a%3c this, too, when there was no continuous succession of adepts, %0a%3c no professors of note, to ensure their transmission. %0a%3c %0a%3c For how few there are, in fact, who know anything, even %0a%3c by hearsay, about the only professors of this art whose names %0a%3c have come down to us, Apusorus 10 and Zaratus of Media, %0a%3c Marmarus and Arabantiphocus of Babylonia, and Tarmoendas %0a%3c of Assyria, men who have left not the slightest memorials of %0a%3c their existence. But the most surprising thing of all is, that %0a%3c %0a%3c 5 Or Bactriana, more properly. %0a%3c %0a%3c Magic, no doubt, has been the subject of belief from the earliest times, %0a%3c whatever may have been the age of Zoroaster, the Zarathustra of theZend- %0a%3c avesta, and the Zerdusht of the Persians. In the Zendavesta he is repre¬ %0a%3c sented as living in the reign of Gushtasp, generally identified with Darius %0a%3c flystaspes. He probably lived at a period anterior to that of the Median %0a%3c and Persian kings. Niebuhr regards him as a purely mythical personage %0a%3c ' See end of B. n. « See end of this Book. %0a%3c %0a%3c 1 An exaggeration, of Oriental origin, most probably %0a%3c 16 These names have all, most probably, been transmitted to us in a cor¬ %0a%3c rupted form. Ajasson gives some suggestions as to their probable Eastern %0a%3c tomi and origin. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chnp. 2.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c WIIO FIRST PRACTISED MAGIC. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 423 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Homer should he total]}’’ silent upon this art in his account 11 of %0a%3c the Trojan War, while in his story of the wanderings of %0a%3c Ulysses, so much of the work should be taken up with it, that %0a%3c we may justly conclude that the poem is based upon nothing %0a%3c else; if, indeed, we are willing to grant that his accounts of %0a%3c Proteus and of the songs of the Sirens are to be understood in %0a%3c this sense, and that the stories of Circe and of the summoning %0a%3c up of the shades below, 12 bear reference solely to the practices %0a%3c of sorcerers. And then, too, to come to more recent times, no %0a%3c one has told us how the art of sorcery reached Telmessus, 13 a %0a%3c city devoted to all the services of religion, or at what period it %0a%3c came over and reached the matrons of Thessaly; whose name 14 %0a%3c has long passed, in our part of the world, as the appellation of %0a%3c those who practise an art, originally introduced among them¬ %0a%3c selves even, from foreign lands. 15 For in the days of the Trojan %0a%3c War, Thessaly was still contented with such remedies 16 as she %0a%3c owed to the skill of Chiron, and her only 17 lightnings were the %0a%3c lightnings hurled by Mars. 18 Indeed, for my own part, I am %0a%3c surprised that the imputation of magical practices should have so %0a%3c strongly attached to the people once under the sway of Achilles, %0a%3c that Menander even, a man unrivalled for perception in lite¬ %0a%3c rary knowledge, has entitled one of his Comedies “The Thes¬ %0a%3c salian Matron,” and has therein described the devices practised %0a%3c by the females of that country in bringing down the moon %0a%3c from the heavens. 18 * I should have been inclined to think %0a%3c that Orpheus had been the first to introduce into a country so %0a%3c near his own, certain magical superstitions based upon the %0a%3c practice of medicine, were it not the fact that Thrace, his %0a%3c native land, was at that time totally a stranger to the magic %0a%3c art. %0a%3c %0a%3c 11 One among the many proofs, Ajasson says, that the Iliad and the %0a%3c Odyssey belong to totally different periods. %0a%3c %0a%3c 14 In reference to the Tenth Book of the Odyssey. %0a%3c %0a%3c 13 See B. v. cc. 28, 29. Cicero mentions a college of Aruspices estab¬ %0a%3c lished at this city. %0a%3c %0a%3c 14 The name “Thessala” was commonly used by the Romans to signify %0a%3c %0a%3c an enchantress, sorceress, or witch.

It was he who first 20 disseminated, as it were, %0a%3c the germs of this monstrous art, and tainted therewith all parts %0a%3c of the world through which the Persians passed. Authors %0a%3c ■who have made diligent enquiries into this subject, make men¬ %0a%3c tion of a second Zoroaster, a native of Proconnesus, as living a %0a%3c little before the time of Osthanes. That it was this samo %0a%3c Osthanes, more particularly, that inspired the Greeks, not with %0a%3c a fondness only, but a rage, for the art of magic, , is a fact be¬ %0a%3c yond all doubt: though at the same time I would remark, %0a%3c that in the most ancient times, and indeed almost invariably, %0a%3c it w r as in this 21 branch of science, that was sought the highest %0a%3c point of celebrity and of literary renown. At all events, %0a%3c Pythagoras, we find, Empedocles, Democritus, and Plato, %0a%3c crossed the seas, in order to attain a knowledge thereof, sub¬ %0a%3c mitting, to speak the truth, more to the evils of exile 22 than %0a%3c to the mere inconveniences of travel. Returning home, it was %0a%3c upon the praises of this art that they expatiated—it was this %0a%3c that they held as one of their grandest mysteries. It was %0a%3c Democritus, too, who first drew attention to Apollobeches 23 of %0a%3c Coptos, to Dardanus, 24 and to Phoenix : the works of Dardanus %0a%3c he sought in the tomb of that personage, and his own were %0a%3c composed in accordance with the doctrines there found. That %0a%3c these doctrines should have been received by any portion of %0a%3c mankind, and transmitted to us by the aid of memory, is to %0a%3c me surprising beyond anything I can conceive. 25 All the par¬ %0a%3c ticulars there found are so utterly incredible, so utterly re- %0a%3c %0a%3c 19 Ajasson queries whether thisisapropername,or an epithet merely. %0a%3c %0a%3c 20 Ajasson combats this assertion at considerable length, and with good %0a%3c reason. It is quite inadmissible. %0a%3c %0a%3c 21 The mysteries of philosophy, as Ajasson remarks, were not necessarily %0a%3c identical with the magic art. %0a%3c %0a%3c 22 In reality, Pythagoras was an exile from the tyranny of the ruler of %0a%3c Samos, Plato from the court of Dionysius the Younger, and Democritus %0a%3c from the ignorance of his fellow-countrymen of Abdera. There is no %0a%3c doubt that Pythagoras and Democritus made considerable researches into %0a%3c the art of magic as practised in the East. %0a%3c %0a%3c 23 Nothing is known of this writer. %0a%3c %0a%3c 24 Dardanus, the ancestor of the Trojans, if he is the person here meant, %0a%3c is said to have introduced the worship of the gods into Samothrace. %0a%3c %0a%3c 25 The works of Homer were transmitted in a similar manner. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 3.] WHETHER MAGIC WAS EVER PRACTISED IK ITALY. 425 %0a%3c %0a%3c volting, that those even who admire Democritus in other %0a%3c respects, are strong in their denial that these works were really %0a%3c written by him. Their denial, however, is in vain; for it %0a%3c was he, beyond all doubt, who had the greatest share in fas¬ %0a%3c cinating men’s minds with these attractive chimseras. %0a%3c %0a%3c There is also a marvellous coincidence, in the fact that the %0a%3c two arts — medicine, I mean, and magic — were developed %0a%3c simultaneously : medicine by the writings of Hippocrates, and %0a%3c magic by the works of Democritus, about the period of the %0a%3c Peloponnesian War, which was waged in Greece in the year %0a%3c of the City of Rome 300. %0a%3c %0a%3c There is another sect, also, of adepts in the magic art, who %0a%3c derive their origin from Moses, 26 Jaimes, 27 and Lotapea, 28 Jews %0a%3c by birth, 29 but many thousand years posterior to Zoroaster : and %0a%3c as much more recent, again, is the branch of magic culti¬ %0a%3c vated in Cyprus. 60 In the time, too, of Alexander the Great, %0a%3c this profession received no small accession to its credit from %0a%3c the influence of a second Osthanes, who had the honour of %0a%3c accompanying that prince in his expeditions, and who, evi¬ %0a%3c dently, beyond all doubt, travelled S1 over every part of the %0a%3c world. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 3.-WHETHER MAGIC WAS EVER PRACTISED IK ITALY. AT %0a%3c %0a%3c WHAT PERIOD THE SENATE FIRST FORBADE HUMAN SACRIFICES. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is clear that there are early traces still existing of the %0a%3c %0a%3c 26 Moses, no doubt, was represented by the Egyptian priesthood as a %0a%3c magician, in reference more particularly to the miracles wrought by him %0a%3c before Pharaoh. From them the Greeks would receive the notion. %0a%3c %0a%3c 27 In 2 Tim. iii. 8, we find the words, “Now as Jannes and Jambres %0a%3c ■withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth.’’ Eusebius, in his Prcc- %0a%3c paratio Evangelica, B. ix., states that Jannes and Jambres, or Mambres, %0a%3c were the names of Egyptian writers, who practised Magic, and opposed %0a%3c Moses before Pharaoh. This contest was probably represented by the %0a%3c Egyptian priesthood as merely a dispute between two antagonistic schools %0a%3c of Idagic. %0a%3c %0a%3c 28 Of this person nothing is known. The former editions mostly have %0a%3c “ Jotapea.’’ “ Jotapata” was the name of a town in Syria, the birthplace %0a%3c of Josephus. %0a%3c %0a%3c 29 lie is mistaken here as to the nation to which Jannes belonged. %0a%3c %0a%3c so By some it has been supposed that this bears reference to Christianity, %0a%3c as introduced into Cyprus by the Apostle Barnabas Owing to the miracles %0a%3c wrought in the infancy of the Church, the religion of the Christians was %0a%3c very generally looked upon as a sort of Magic. The point is very doubtful. %0a%3c %0a%3c 31 ilis itinerary, Ajassou remarks, would have been a great curiosity. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 426 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c flint's natural history. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Hook XXX. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c introduction of magic into Italy; in our laws of the Twelve %0a%3c Tables for instance; besides other convincing proofs, which I %0a%3c have already noticed in a preceding Book. 33 At last, in the %0a%3c year of the City 657, Cneius Cornelius Lentulus and P. Lici- %0a%3c nius Crassus being consuls, a decree forbidding human sacri¬ %0a%3c fices 33 was passed by the senate ; from which period the cele¬ %0a%3c bration of these horrid rites ceased in public, and, for some ‘ %0a%3c time, altogether. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 4.-THE DRUIDS OF THE GALLIC PROVINCES. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Gallic provinces, too, were pervaded by the magic art,' 5 %0a%3c and that even down to a period within memory ; for it was %0a%3c the Emperor Tiberius that put down their Druids, 36 and all that %0a%3c tribe of wizards and physicians. But why make further men¬ %0a%3c tion of these prohibitions, with reference to an art which has %0a%3c now crossed the very Ocean even, and has penetrated to the %0a%3c void 37 recesses of Nature? At the present day, struck with %0a%3c fascination, Britannia still cultivates this art, and that, with %0a%3c ceremonials so august, that she might almost seem 38 to have %0a%3c been the first to communicate them to the people of Persia. 39 %0a%3c To such a degree are nations throughout the whole world, %0a%3c totally different as they are and quite unknown to one another, %0a%3c in accord upon this one point! %0a%3c %0a%3c 32 B. xxviii. c. 4. %0a%3c %0a%3c 33 These sacrifices forming the most august rite of the Magic art, as %0a%3c practised in Italy. %0a%3c %0a%3c 34 That this art was still practised in secret in the days of Pliny himself, %0a%3c we learn from the testimony of Tacitus (Annals, II. 69), in his account of %0a%3c the enquiries instituted on the death of Germanicus. %0a%3c %0a%3c 35 More particularly in the worship of their divinity lieu or Hesus, the %0a%3c god of war. %0a%3c %0a%3c 36 This he did officially, but not effectually, and the Druids survived as %0a%3c a class for many centuries both in Gaul and Britain. %0a%3c %0a%3c 37 He alludes to the British shores bordering on the Atlantic. See B. %0a%3c xix. c. 2. %0a%3c %0a%3c 33 It is a curious fact that the round towers of Ireland bear a strong re¬ %0a%3c semblance to those, the ruins of which are still to be seen on the plains of %0a%3c ancient Persia. %0a%3c %0a%3c 39 “ Ut dedisse Persis videri possit.” This might possibly mean, “That %0a%3c Persia might almost seem to have communicated it direct to Britain.” Ajas- %0a%3c son enumerates the following superstitions of ancient Britain, as bearing %0a%3c probable marks of an Oriental origin: the worship of the stars, lakes, %0a%3c forests, and rivers; the ceremonials used in cutting the plants samiolus, %0a%3c selago, and mistletoe, and the virtues attributed to the adder’s egg. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 5.] THE VARIOUS BRANCHES OF MAGIC. 427 %0a%3c %0a%3c Such being the fact, then, we cannot too highly appreciate %0a%3c the obligation that is due to the Roman people, for having put %0a%3c an end to those monstrous rites, in accordance with which, to %0a%3c murder a man was to do an act of the greatest devoutness, and %0a%3c to eat 40 his flesh was to secure the highest blessings of health. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 5. (2.)—THE VARIOUS BRANCHES OF MAGIC. %0a%3c %0a%3c According to what Osthanes tells us, there are numerous %0a%3c sorts of magic. It is practised 41 with water, for instance, with %0a%3c balls, by the aid of the air, of the stars, of lamps, basins, hatchets, %0a%3c and numerous other appliances; means by which it engages %0a%3c to grant a foreknowledge of things to come, as well as converse %0a%3c with ghosts and spirits of the dead. All these practices, how¬ %0a%3c ever, have been proved by the Emperor Hero, in our own day, %0a%3c to be so many false and chimaerical illusions; entertaining as %0a%3c he did a passion for the magic art, unsurpassed even by his %0a%3c enthusiastic love for the music of the lyre, and for the songs of %0a%3c tragedy; so strangely did his elevation to the highest point %0a%3c of human fortune act upon the deep-seated vices of his mind ! %0a%3c It was his leading desire to command the gods of heaven, and %0a%3c no aspiration could he conceive more noble than this. Never %0a%3c did person lavish more favours upon any one of the arts ; and %0a%3c for the attainment of this, his favourite object, nothing was %0a%3c wanting to him, neither riches, nor power, nor aptitude at %0a%3c learning, and what not besides, at the expense of a suffering %0a%3c world. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is a boundless, an indubitable proof, I say, of the utter %0a%3c falsity of this art, that such a man as Nero abandoned it; and %0a%3c would to heaven that he had consulted the shades below, and %0a%3c any other spirits as well, in order to be certified in his sus¬ %0a%3c picions, rather than commissioned the denizens of stews and %0a%3c brothels to make those inquisitions of his [with reference to %0a%3c the objects of his jealousy]. For assuredly there can be no %0a%3c %0a%3c 40 Ajasson seems inclined to suggest that this may possibly bear reference %0a%3c to the Christian doctrines of redemption and the Sacrament of the Lord's %0a%3c Supper. %0a%3c %0a%3c 41 These kinds of divination, rather than magic, were called hydromancy, %0a%3c sphaeromancy, aeromancy, astromancy, lychnomancy, lecanomancy, and %0a%3c axinomancy. See Rabelais, B. iii. c. 25, where a very full account is given %0a%3c of the Magic Art, as practised by the ancients. Coffee-grounds, glair of %0a%3c eggs, and rose-leaves, are still used in France for purposes ot divination %0a%3c by the superstitious. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 428 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c pliny’s natural history. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XXX. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c superstition, however barbarous and ferocious the rites which %0a%3c it sanctions, that is not more tolerant than the imaginations %0a%3c which he conceived, and owing to which, by a series of blood¬ %0a%3c stained crimes, our abodes were peopled with ghosts. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 6.—THE SUBTERFUGES PRACTISED BY THE MAGICIANS. %0a%3c %0a%3c The magicians, too, have certain modes of evasion, as, for %0a%3c instance, that the gods will not obey, or even appear to, persons %0a%3c who have freckles upon the skin. Was this perchance the %0a%3c obstacle 42 in Nero’s way ? As for his limbs, there was 43 nothing %0a%3c deficient in them. And then, besides, he was at liberty to %0a%3c make choice of the days prescribed by the magic ritual: it %0a%3c was an easy thing for him to make choice of sheep whose %0a%3c colour was no other than perfectly black: and as to sacrificing %0a%3c human beings, there was nothing in the world that gave him %0a%3c greater pleasure. The Magian Tiridates 44 was at his court, %0a%3c having repaired thither, in token of our triumph over Armenia, %0a%3c accompanied by a train which cost dear to the provinces through %0a%3c which it passed. For the fact was, that he was unwilling to %0a%3c travel by water, it being a maxim with the adepts in this art %0a%3c that it is improper to spit into the sea or to profane that element %0a%3c by any other of the evacuations that are inseparable from the %0a%3c infirmities of human nature. He brought with him, too, %0a%3c several other Magi, and went so far as to initiate the emperor %0a%3c in the repasts 45 of the craft; and yet the prince, for all he had %0a%3c bestowed a kingdom upon the stranger, found himself unable %0a%3c to receive at his hands, in return, this art. %0a%3c %0a%3c We may rest fully persuaded then, that magic is a thing %0a%3c detestable in itself. Frivolous and lying as it is, it still bears, %0a%3c however, some shadow of truth upon it; though reflected, in %0a%3c reality, by the practices of those who study the arts of secret %0a%3c poisoning, and not the pursuits of magic. Let any one picture %0a%3c to himself the lies of the magicians of former days, when he %0a%3c learns what has been stated by the grammarian Apion, 46 a %0a%3c %0a%3c 42 Suetonius says that his body was full of foul spots. %0a%3c %0a%3c 43 It was probably a doctrine of Magic, that an adept must not be de¬ %0a%3c ficient in any of his limbs. %0a%3c %0a%3c 44 After being conquered by the Roman general, Corbulo, he received %0a%3c the crown of Armenia from Nero, a.d. 63. %0a%3c %0a%3c 45 All vegetable substances were divided, according to their doctrine, into %0a%3c the pure and the impure, the rule being strictly observed at their repasts. %0a%3c %0a%3c 46 See end of this Rook. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c d,ap. 7.] REMEDIES DERITED FROM THE MOI.F,. 429 %0a%3c %0a%3c person whom I remember seeing myself when young. He %0a%3c tells us that the plant cynocephalia, 47 known in Egypt as %0a%3c “osiritis,” is useful for divination, and is a preservative against %0a%3c all the malpractices of magic, but that if a person takes it out %0a%3c of the ground entire, he will die upon the spot. He asserts, %0a%3c also, that he himself had raised the spirits 48 of the dead, in %0a%3c order to make enquiry of Homer in reference to his native %0a%3c country and his parents; but he does not dare, he tells us, %0a%3c disclose the answer he received. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 7. (3.)—OPINIONS OF THE MAGICIANS RELATIVE TO THE %0a%3c MOLE. FIVE REMEDIES DERIVED FROM IT. %0a%3c %0a%3c Let the following stand as a remarkable proof of the frivo¬ %0a%3c lous nature of the magic art. Of all animals it is the mole %0a%3c that the magicians admire most ! a creature that has been %0a%3c stamped with condemnation by Nature in so many waj r s; %0a%3c doomed as it is to perpetual blindness, 49 and adding to this %0a%3c darkness a life of gloom in the depths of the earth, and a state %0a%3c more nearly resembling that of the dead and buried. There %0a%3c is no animal in the entrails of which they put such implicit %0a%3c faith, no animal, they think, better suited for the rites of reli¬ %0a%3c gion ; so much so, indeed, that if a person swallows the heart of %0a%3c a mole, fresh from the body and still palpitating, he will receive %0a%3c the gift of divination, they assure us, and a foreknowledge of %0a%3c future events. Tooth-ache, they assert, may be cured by %0a%3c taking the tooth of a live mole, and attaching it to the body. %0a%3c As to other statements of theirs relative to this animal, we %0a%3c shall draw attention to them on the fitting occasions, and shall %0a%3c only add here that one of the most probable ot all their asser¬ %0a%3c tions is, that the mole neutralizes the bite of the shrew-mouse; %0a%3c seeing that, as already 60 stated, the very earth even that is %0a%3c found in the rut of a cart-wheel, acts as a remedy in such a %0a%3c case. %0a%3c %0a%3c 47 See B. xxv. c. 80. %0a%3c %0a%3c 48 Like the assertions of the famous impostor of the close of the last %0a%3c century, Count Cagliostro. %0a%3c %0a%3c 49 A mistake, of course; and one for which there is little excuse, as its %0a%3c %0a%3c eyes are easily perceptible.

REMEDIES %0a%3c %0a%3c FOR TOOTH-ACHE. %0a%3c %0a%3c But to proceed with the remedies for tooth-ache—the magi- %0a%3c cians tell us, that it may be cured by using the ashes of the %0a%3c head of a dog that has died in a state of madness. The head, %0a%3c however, must he burnt without the flesh, and the ashes %0a%3c injected with oil of Cyprus 51 into the ear on the side affected. %0a%3c For the same purpose also, the left eye-tooth of a dog is used, %0a%3c the gum of the affected tooth being lanced with it; one of the %0a%3c vertebrae also of a dragon or of an enhydris, which is a male %0a%3c white serpent. 52 The eye-tooth, too, of this last, is used for %0a%3c scarifying the gums; and when the pain affects the teeth of the %0a%3c upper jaw, they attach to the patient two of the upper teeth of %0a%3c the serpent, and, similarly, two of the lower ones for tooth-ache %0a%3c in the lower jaw. Persons who go in pursuit of the crocodile, %0a%3c anoint themselves with the fat of this animal. The gums are %0a%3c also scarified with the frontal bones of a lizard, taken from %0a%3c it at full moon, and not allowed to touch the ground: or else %0a%3c the mouth is rinsed with a decoction of dogs’ teeth in wiue, %0a%3c boiled down to one half. %0a%3c %0a%3c Ashes of dogs’ teeth, mixed with honey, are useful for %0a%3c difficult dentition in children, and a dentifrice is similarly %0a%3c prepared from them. Hollow teeth are plugged with ashes of %0a%3c burnt mouse-dung, or with a lizard’s liver, dried. To eat a %0a%3c snake’s heart, or to wear it, attached to the body, is considered %0a%3c highly efficacious. There are some among the magicians, who %0a%3c recommend a mouse to be eaten twice a month, as a preventive %0a%3c of tooth-ache. Earth-worms, boiled in oil and injected into %0a%3c the ear on the side affected, afford considerable relief: ashes, %0a%3c too, of burnt earth-worms, introduced into carious teeth, make %0a%3c them come out easily; and, used as a friction, they allay pains %0a%3c in such of the teeth as are sound: the proper way of burning %0a%3c them is in an earthen potsherd. They are useful, too, boiled %0a%3c with root of the mulberry-tree in squill vinegar, and employed %0a%3c as a collutory for the teeth. The small worm that is found %0a%3c in the plant known as Venus’ 53 bath, is remarkably useful, %0a%3c %0a%3c 51 See B. xii. c. 51. %0a%3c %0a%3c 52 It is doubtful what is meant by this mole white “ water-serpent." %0a%3c In B. xxxii. c. 26, lie appears to include it among the fishes. %0a%3c %0a%3c 53 See B. xxv. c. 108. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 8.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c REMEDIES FOB.

The bugs 55 that are found upon mallows, are injected %0a%3c into the ears, beaten up with oil of roses. %0a%3c %0a%3c The small grits of sand that are found in the horns of snails, %0a%3c introduced into hollow teeth, remove the pain instantaneously. %0a%3c Ashes of empty snail-shells, mixed with myrrh, 56 are good for %0a%3c the gums ; the ashes also of a serpent., burnt wdth salt in an %0a%3c earthen pot, and injected, with oil of roses, into the ear opposite %0a%3c to the side affected ; or else the slough of a snake, warmed with %0a%3c oil and torch-pine resin, 57 and injected into either ear. Some %0a%3c persons add frankincense and oil of roses, a preparation which, %0a%3c of itself, introduced into hollow teeth, makes them come out %0a%3c without pain. It is all a fiction, in my opinion, to say that %0a%3c white snakes cast this slough about the rising of the Dog-star; %0a%3c for such a thing has never been seen in Italy, and it is still %0a%3c more improbable that sloughing should take place at so late %0a%3c a period in the warmer climates. We find it stated also, that this %0a%3c slough, even when it has been kept for some time, mixed with %0a%3c wax, will extract a tooth very expeditiously, if applied there¬ %0a%3c to : a snake’s tooth, also, attached to the body as an amulet, %0a%3c allays tooth-ache. Some persons think that it is a good remedy %0a%3c to catch a spider with the left hand, to beat it up with oil of %0a%3c roses, and then to inject it into the ear on the side affected. %0a%3c %0a%3c The small bones of poultry, preserved in a hole in a wall, %0a%3c the medullary channel being left intact, will immediately cure %0a%3c tooth-ache, they say, if the tooth is touched or the gum %0a%3c scarified therewith, care being taken to throw away the bone %0a%3c the moment the operation is performed. A similar result is %0a%3c obtained by using raven’s dung, wrapped in wool and attached %0a%3c to the body, or else sparrow’s dung, warmed with oil and in¬ %0a%3c jected into the ear on the side affected. This last remedy, %0a%3c however, is productive of an intolerable itching, for which %0a%3c reason it is considered a better plan to rub the part with the %0a%3c ashes of young sparrows burnt upon twigs, mixed with vinegar %0a%3c for the purpose. %0a%3c %0a%3c ®* It is a singular tiling that we still bear of the maggots found in filberte %0a%3c being used for the same purpose. %0a%3c %0a%3c 5J See B. xxix. c. 17. %0a%3c %0a%3c M Marcus Empiricus says, honey. 57 See B. xvi. c. 19. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 432 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c pltny’s natural hi stout. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XXX. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAL’. 9.

Applied with oil of roses in wool, it causes scurf upon %0a%3c the face to disappear : some persons add butter to it. In eases %0a%3c of morphew, the spots are first pricked with a needle, and then %0a%3c rubbed with dog’s gall. For livid spots and bruises on the %0a%3c face, the lights of a ram or sheep are cut fine and applied %0a%3c warm, or else pigeons’ dung is used. Goose-grease or poultry- %0a%3c grease is a good preservative of the skin of the face. For %0a%3c lichens a liniment is used, made of mouse-dung in vinegar, or %0a%3c of the ashes of a hedge-hog mixed with oil: but, when these %0a%3c remedies are employed, it is recommended first to foment the %0a%3c face with nitre dissolved in vinegar. Maladies of the face are also %0a%3c removed by employing the ashes of the small, broad, snail that %0a%3c is so commonly found, mixed with honey. Indeed, the asheB %0a%3c of all snails are of an inspissative nature, and are possessed of %0a%3c certain calorific and detersive properties : hence it is that they %0a%3c form an ingredient in caustic applications, and are used in the %0a%3c form of a liniment for itch-scabs, leprous sores, and freckles on %0a%3c the face. %0a%3c %0a%3c I find it stated that a certain kind of ant known by the name %0a%3c of “ Herculanea,” 68 is beaten up, with the addition of a little %0a%3c %0a%3c 58 Dalechamps thinks that these “ Herculean ” ants were so called from %0a%3c their great size.

The buprestis 60 %0a%3c is an insect but rarely found in Italy, and very similar to a %0a%3c scarabaeus, with long legs. Concealed among the grass, it is %0a%3c very liable to be swallowed unobserved, by oxen in particular; %0a%3c and the moment it comes in contact with the gall, it causes %0a%3c such a degree of inflammation, that the animal bursts asunder; %0a%3c a circumstance to which the insect owes its name. Applied %0a%3c topically with he-goat suet, it removes lichens on the face, %0a%3c owing to its corrosive properties, as previously 05 stated. A %0a%3c vulture’s blood, beaten up with cedar resin and root of white %0a%3c chamaeleon—a plant which we have already 61 mentioned—and %0a%3c covered with a cabbage leaf, when applied, is good for the cure %0a%3c of leprosy; the same, too, with the legs of locusts, beaten up %0a%3c with he-goat suet. Pimples are treated with poultry grease, %0a%3c beaten up and kneaded with onions. One very useful sub¬ %0a%3c stance lor the face is honey in which the bees have died; but a %0a%3c sovereign detergent lor that part is swans’ grease, which has %0a%3c also the property of effacing wrinkles.

Affections of %0a%3c the uvula and pains in the fauces are alleviated by using the dung %0a%3c of lambs before they have begun to graze, dried in the shade. %0a%3c Diseases of the uvula are cured with the juices of a snail pierced %0a%3c with a needle; the snail, however, must be then hung up in the %0a%3c smoke. The same maladies are treated also with ashes of %0a%3c burnt, swallows, mixed with honey; a preparation which is %0a%3c equally good for affections of the tonsillary glands. Sheep’s %0a%3c milk, used as a gargle, alleviates diseases of the fauces and %0a%3c tonsillary glands. Millepedes, bruised with pigeons’ dung, are %0a%3c taken as a gargle, with raisin wine ; and they are'applied, exter¬ %0a%3c nally, with dried figs and nitre, for the purpose of soothing %0a%3c roughness of the fauces and catarrhs.

But of all the remedies %0a%3c spoken of as furnished by the swallow, one of the most effica¬ %0a%3c cious is that derived from the y r oung of the wild swallow, a %0a%3c bird which may be easily recognized by the peculiar conforma¬ %0a%3c tion of its nest . 61 By far the most effectual, however, of them %0a%3c all, are the young of the bank-swallow , 68 that being the name %0a%3c given to the kind which builds its nest in holes on the banksof %0a%3c rivers. Many persons recommend the young of any kind of %0a%3c swallow as a food, assuring us that the person who takes it %0a%3c need be in no apprehension of quinzy for the whole of the %0a%3c ensuing year. The young of this bird are sometimes stifled %0a%3c and then burnt in a vessel with the blood, the ashes being %0a%3c administered to the patient with bread or in the drink: some, %0a%3c however, mix with them the ashes of a burnt weasel, in equal %0a%3c proportion. The same remedies are recommended also for %0a%3c scrofula, and they are administered for epilepsy, once a day, in %0a%3c drink. Swallows preserved in salt are taken for quinzy, in %0a%3c doses of one drachma, in drink: the nest , 69 too, of the bird, %0a%3c taken internally, is said to be a cure for the same disease. %0a%3c %0a%3c Millepedes , 10 it is thought, used in the form of a liniment, are %0a%3c peculiarly efficacious for quinzy : some persons, also, administer %0a%3c eleven of them, bruised in one semi-sextarius of hydromel, %0a%3c through a reed, they being of no use whatever if once touched %0a%3c by the teeth. Other remedies mentioned are, the broth of a %0a%3c %0a%3c 63 See B. iv. c. 23, B. viii. c. 59, and cc. 15 and 43 of the present Book. %0a%3c %0a%3c 54 “ Smegma.” 65 See B. xx. c. 2. %0a%3c %0a%3c 66 No very great obligation, apparently. %0a%3c %0a%3c " 7 See B. x. c. 49. 69 “ Riparia.” %0a%3c %0a%3c M The only birds’ nests that are now taken internally are the aouthm %0a%3c lotirong, or, edible birds’ nests, of the Chinese. %0a%3c %0a%3c 50 See B. xxix. c. 39. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 12.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BEMKDIES FOE SCEOFULA. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 43.0 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c mouse boiled with vervain, a thong of dogskin passed three %0a%3c times round the back, and pigeons’ dung mixed with wine and %0a%3c oil.

For ulcerated scrofula, a weasel’s blood is employed, or %0a%3c the animal itself, boiled in wine ; but not in cases where the %0a%3c tumours have been opened with the knife. It is said, too, %0a%3c that a weasel, eaten with the food, is productive of a similar %0a%3c effect; sometimes, also, it is burnt upon twigs, and the ashes %0a%3c are applied with axle-grease. In some instances, a green lizard %0a%3c is attached to the body of the patient, a fresh one being sub¬ %0a%3c stituted at the end of thirty days. Some persons preserve the %0a%3c heart of this animal in a small silver vessel, 11 as a cure for %0a%3c scrofula in females. Old snails, those found adhering to shrubs %0a%3c more particularly, are pounded with the shells on, and applied %0a%3c as a liniment. Asps, too, are similarly employed, reduced to %0a%3c ashes and mixed with bull suet; snakes’ fat also, diluted with %0a%3c oil; and the ashes of a burnt snake, applied •with oil or wax. %0a%3c It is a good plan also, in cases of scrofula, to eat the middle %0a%3c of a snake, the extremities being first removed, or to drink %0a%3c the ashes of the reptile, similarly prepared and burnt in a %0a%3c new earthen vessel: they will be found much more efficacious, %0a%3c however, when the snake has been killed between the ruts %0a%3c made by wheels. It is recommended also, to dig up a cricket %0a%3c with the earth about its hole, and to apply it in the form of a %0a%3c liniment; to use pigeons’ dung, either by itself, or with barley- %0a%3c meal, or oatmeal and vinegar; or else to apply the ashes ot a %0a%3c burnt mole, mixed with honey. %0a%3c %0a%3c Some persons apply the liver of this last animal, crumbled %0a%3c in the hands, due care being taken not to wash it off for three %0a%3c days : it is said, too, that a mole’s right foot is a remedy for %0a%3c scrofula. Others, again, cut off the head of a mole, and after %0a%3c kneading it with earth thrown up by those animals, divide %0a%3c it into tablets, and keep it in a pewter box, for the treatment %0a%3c of all kinds of tumours, diseases of the neck, and the affections %0a%3c known as “ apostemes in all such cases the use of swine s %0a%3c %0a%3c 71 Marcus Empiricus says that the heart must be enclosed in a silver %0a%3c lupine and worn suspended from the neck, being efficacious for scrofula %0a%3c both in males and females, ihe silver lupine was probably what we. %0a%3c should call a “locket.” %0a%3c %0a%3c F F 2 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 436 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c I’Ll NT’S NATURAL HI STOUT. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Hook XXX. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c flesh is forbidden to the patient. “ Taurus ” 72 is the name %0a%3c usually given to an earth-beetle, very similar to a tick in %0a%3c appearance, and which it derives from the diminutive horns %0a%3c with which it is furnished : some persons call it the “ earth- %0a%3c louse .” 73 From the earth thrown up by these insects a lini¬ %0a%3c ment is prepared for scrofula and similar diseases, and for gout, %0a%3c the application not being washed off till the end of three days. %0a%3c This last remedy is effectual for a whole year, and all those %0a%3c other properties are attributed to it which we have mentioned ’ 1 %0a%3c when speaking of crickets.

There are some authorities who call this insect a %0a%3c “centipede,” and recommend it to be given in warm water. %0a%3c Snails are administered to persons subject to fainting fits, %0a%3c alienation of the senses, and vertigo : for which purposes, a %0a%3c snail is beaten up, shell and all, with three cyathi of raisin %0a%3c wine, and the mixture is administered warm with the drink, %0a%3c for nine days at most. Others, again, give-one snail the first %0a%3c day, two the second, three the third, two the fourth, and one %0a%3c the fifth; a mode of treatment also adopted for the cure of %0a%3c asthma and of abscesses. %0a%3c %0a%3c There is, according to some authorities, an insect resem¬ %0a%3c bling the locust in appearance, destitute of wings, and known %0a%3c by the Greek name of “ troxallis,” it being without a name in %0a%3c Latin: a considerable number of writers, however, consider %0a%3c it as identical with the insect known to us as “ gryllus.” 89 %0a%3c Twenty of these insects, they say, should be grilled, and taken %0a%3c in honied wine, by patients troubled with hardness of breath¬ %0a%3c ing or spitting of blood.

A similar method is %0a%3c also adopted for the cure of cough. Honey in which the bees %0a%3c have died, is particularly good for the cure of abscesses. For %0a%3c spitting of blood a vulture’s lungs are used, burnt upon vine %0a%3c logs, and mixed with half the quantity of pomegranate blos¬ %0a%3c soms, or with the same proportion of quince and lily blossom : %0a%3c the whole being taken morning and evening, in wine, if there %0a%3c is no fever ; but where there are symptoms of lever, instead of %0a%3c wine, water is used in which quinces have been boiled. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 17.-REMEDIES FOR AFFECTIONS OF THE SPLEEN. %0a%3c %0a%3c According to the prescriptions given by the magicians, a %0a%3c fresh sheep’s milt is the best application for pains in the spleen, %0a%3c ihe person who applies it uttering these words: “ I his I do %0a%3c %0a%3c 88 See c. 12 of this Book. . %0a%3c %0a%3c 89 Our “ cricket.” The troxallis was probably a kind of locust, still %0a%3c known to naturalists by that name. %0a%3c %0a%3c so o Protropum.” "Wine of the first running. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 440 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c PLINY’S NATURAL niSTORT. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XXX. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c for the cure of the spleen.” This done, it is enjoined that the %0a%3c milt should be covered up with mortar in the wall of the %0a%3c patient’s sleeping-room, and sealed with a ring, a charm 91 being %0a%3c repeated thrice nine times. A dog’s milt, removed from the %0a%3c animal while still alive, taken with the food, is a cure for dis¬ %0a%3c eases of the spleen : some, again, attach it fresh to that part %0a%3c of the patient’s body. Others give the patient—without his %0a%3c knowing it—the milt of a puppy two days old, to eat, in %0a%3c squill vinegar ; the milt, too, of a hedge-hog is similarly %0a%3c used.

For the cure %0a%3c of lumbago, the spotted lizard 93 from beyond seas is used: %0a%3c the head and intestines being first removed, the body is boiled %0a%3c in wine, with half a denarius of black poppy, and the decoc¬ %0a%3c tion is taken in drink. Green lizards, also, are taken with %0a%3c the food, the feet and head being first removed ; or else three %0a%3c snails are crushed, shells and all, and boiled with fifteen pepper¬ %0a%3c corns in wine.

(7.)—REMEDIES FOR DYSENTERY. %0a%3c %0a%3c Dysentery is cured by taking the broth of a leg of mutton, %0a%3c boiled with linseed in water ; by eating old ewe-milk cheese; %0a%3c or by taking mutton suet boiled in astringent wine. This %0a%3c last is good, too, for the iliac passion, and for inveterate coughs. %0a%3c Dysentery is removed also, by taking a spotted lizard from %0a%3c beyond seas, boiled down till the skin only is left, the head, %0a%3c feet, and intestines, being first removed. A couple of snails %0a%3c also, and an egg, are beaten up, shells and all, in both cases, %0a%3c and made lukewarm in a new vessel, with some salt, three %0a%3c cyathi of water, and two cyathi of raisin-wine or date-juice, %0a%3c the decoction being taken in drink. Ashes, too, of burnt snails, %0a%3c are very serviceable, taken in wine with a modicum of resin. %0a%3c %0a%3c The snails without shells, which we have 95 mentioned as %0a%3c being mostly found in Africa, are remarkably useful for dy¬ %0a%3c sentery, five of them being burnt with half a denarius of gum %0a%3c acacia, and taken, in doses of two spoonfuls, in myrtle wine or %0a%3c any other kind of astringent wine, with an equal quantity of %0a%3c warm water. Some persons employ all kinds of African snails %0a%3c indiscriminately in this manner ; while others, again, make use %0a%3c of a similar number of African snails or broad-shelled snails, %0a%3c as an injection, in preference : in cases, too, where the flux is %0a%3c considerable, they add a piece of gum acacia, about the size of %0a%3c a bean. For dysentery and tenesmus, the cast-off slough of a %0a%3c snake is boiled in a pewter vessel with oil of roses: if pre¬ %0a%3c pared in any other kind of vessel, it is applied with an instru¬ %0a%3c ment made of pewter. Chicken-broth is also used as a remedy %0a%3c for these affections; but the broth of an old cock, strongly %0a%3c salted, acts more powerfully as a purgative upon the bowels. %0a%3c A pullet’s craw, grilled and administered with salt and oil, has %0a%3c %0a%3c 95 In B. xxix. c. 36. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 4-12 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c plisy’s natural bistort. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XXX. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c a soothing effect upon coeliac affections; but it is absolutely %0a%3c necessary that neither fowl nor patient should have eaten %0a%3c corn 96 for some time before.

The flesh of a ring-dove, boiled in vinegar, %0a%3c is curative of dysentery and cocliac affections: and for the cure %0a%3c of the former, a thrush is recommended, roasted with myrtle- %0a%3c berries ; a blackbird, also; or honey, boiled, in which the bees %0a%3c have died. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 20 .- REMEDIES FOR THE ILIAC PASSION, AND FOR OTHF.K %0a%3c %0a%3c MALADIES OF THE DOWELS. %0a%3c %0a%3c One of the most dangerous of maladies is that known by the %0a%3c name of “ ileos:” 97 it may be combatted, they say, by tearing %0a%3c a bat asunder, and taking the blood, or by rubbing the abdo¬ %0a%3c men with it. Diarrhoea is arrested more particularly by taking %0a%3c snails, prepared in manner already 98 mentioned for cases of %0a%3c asthma; the ashes, also, of snails burnt alive, administered in %0a%3c astringent wine; the liver of poultry grilled; the dried craw %0a%3c of poultry, a part that is usually thrown away, mixed with %0a%3c poppy-juice—in some cases it is used fresh, grilled, and taken %0a%3c in wine—partridge broth ; the craw of partridges beaten up by %0a%3c itself in red wine ; a wild ringdove boiled in oxycrate ; a sheep’s %0a%3c milt, grilled and beaten up in wine; or else pigeons’ dung, %0a%3c applied with honey. The crop of an ossifrage, dried and taken %0a%3c in drink, is remarkably useful for patients whose digestion is %0a%3c impaired—indeed, its good effects may be felt if they only hold %0a%3c it in the hand while eating. Hence it is that some persons %0a%3c wear it attached to the body as an amulet; a practice which %0a%3c must not be too long continued, it being apt to cause a wasting %0a%3c of the flesh. The blood, too, of a drake has an astringent %0a%3c effect. %0a%3c %0a%3c Flatulency is dispelled by eating snails; and griping pains %0a%3c in the bowels, by taking a sheep’s milt grilled, with wine; a %0a%3c wild ringdove boiled in oxycrate; the fat of an otis" in wine; or %0a%3c the ashes of an ibis, burnt without the feathers, administered in %0a%3c drink. Another prescription mentioned for griping pains in %0a%3c the bowels is of a very marvellous nature : if a duck, they say, %0a%3c is applied to the abdomen, the malady will pass into the bird, %0a%3c %0a%3c 96 See B. xxix. c. 36. 97 The iliac passion, or ileus volvulus. %0a%3c %0a%3c 9S In c. 16 of this Book. %0a%3c %0a%3c 99 A kind of bustard.

Some recommend, however, that it should be burnt %0a%3c to ashes in a new vessel, feathers and all, and then pounded %0a%3c and taken for four consecutive days, in doses of three spoonfuls, %0a%3c in water. Some say that the heart of this bird should be %0a%3c attached to the thigh, and, according to others, the heart should %0a%3c be swallowed fresh, quite warm, in fact. There is a family %0a%3c of consular dignity, known as the Asprenates, 2 two brothers, %0a%3c members of which, were cured of colic; the one by eating a %0a%3c lark and wearing its heart in a golden bracelet; the other, by %0a%3c performing a certain sacrifice in a chapel built of raw bricks, %0a%3c in form of a furnace, and then blocking up the edifice the mo¬ %0a%3c ment the sacrifice was concluded. The ossifrage has a single %0a%3c intestine only, which has the marvellous property of digesting %0a%3c all that the bird has swallowed: the extremity of this intes¬ %0a%3c tine, it is well known, worn as an amulet, is an excellent %0a%3c remedy for colic. %0a%3c %0a%3c There are certain concealed maladies incident to the intes¬ %0a%3c tines, in relation to which there are some marvellous statements %0a%3c made. If to the stomach and chest, more particularly, blind %0a%3c puppies are applied, and suckled with milk from the patient’s %0a%3c mouth, 3 the virulence of the malady, it is said, will be trans¬ %0a%3c ferred to them, and in the end they will die : on opening %0a%3c them, too, the causes of the malady will be sure to be dis¬ %0a%3c covered. In all such cases, however, the puppies must be %0a%3c allowed to die, and must be buried in the earth. According %0a%3c to what the magicians say, if the abdomen is touched with a %0a%3c hat’s blood, the person will be proof against colic for a whole %0a%3c year: when a patient, too, is attacked with the pains of colic, %0a%3c if he can bring himself to drink the water in which he has %0a%3c washed his feet, he will experience a cure. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 21.

If, %0a%3c on the other hand, the animal has discharged its urine upon its %0a%3c body, those who eat the flesh will be sure to be attacked by %0a%3c strangury, it is said. As a lithontriptic, 5 earth-worms are %0a%3c recommended, taken in ordinary wine or raisin wine; or else %0a%3c boiled snails, prepared the same way 6 as for the cure of asthma. %0a%3c For the cure of urinary obstructions, snails are taken from the %0a%3c shells, pounded, and administered in one cyathus of wine, three %0a%3c the first day, two the second, and one the third. For the ex¬ %0a%3c pulsion of calculi, the empty shells are reduced to ashes and %0a%3c taken in drink: the liver also of a water-snake, and the ashes %0a%3c of burnt scorpions are similarly employed, or are taken with %0a%3c bread or eaten with a locust. For the same purpose, the %0a%3c small grits that are found in the gizzard of poultry or in the %0a%3c craw of the ringdove, are beaten up and sprinkled in the %0a%3c patient’s drink; the craw, too, of poultry is taken, dried, or if %0a%3c fresh, grilled. %0a%3c %0a%3c For urinary calculi and other obstructions of the bladder, %0a%3c dung of ring-doves is taken, with beans; ashes also of wild %0a%3c ring-doves’ feathers, mixed with vinegar and honey; the in¬ %0a%3c testines of those birds, reduced to ashes, and administered in %0a%3c doses of three spoonfuls; a small clod from a swallow’s nest, %0a%3c dissolved in warm water; the dried crop of an ossifrage; the %0a%3c dung of a turtle-dove, boiled in honied wine; or the broth of %0a%3c a boiled turtle-dove. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is very beneficial also for urinary affections to eat thrushes %0a%3c with myrtle-berries, or grasshoppers grilled on a shallow-pan; %0a%3c or else to take the millepedes, known as “ ouisei,” 7 in drink. %0a%3c For pains in the bladder, a decoction of lambs’ feet is used. %0a%3c %0a%3c 3 * See B. viii. c. 56. %0a%3c %0a%3c 4 This passage is omitted by Sillig as an evident interpolation from the %0a%3c context a couple of lines below. %0a%3c %0a%3c 5 The belief in lithontriptics can hardly be said to exist at the present %0a%3c day.

In cases where there are chaps and fissures ot those %0a%3c parts, the ashes of the white portion of dogs’ dung are used, %0a%3c mixed with oil of roses ; a prescription due, they say, to iEscu- %0a%3c lapius, 9 and remarkably efficacious also for the removal of %0a%3c warts. Ashes of burnt mouse-dung, swan’s fat, and cow %0a%3c suet, are also used. Procidence of the rectum is reduced by an %0a%3c application of the juices discharged by snails when punctured. %0a%3c For the cure of excoriation of those parts, ashes of burnt wood- %0a%3c mice are used, with honey; the gall of a hedge-bog, with a %0a%3c bat’s brains and bitches’ milk ; goose-grease, with the brains of %0a%3c the bird, alum, and wool-grease; or else pigeons’ dung, mixed %0a%3c with honey. A spider, the head and legs being first removed, %0a%3c is remarkably good as a friction for condylomata. To prevent %0a%3c the acridity of the humours from fretting the flesh, goose- %0a%3c grease is applied, with Punic wax, white lead, and oil of %0a%3c roses; swan’s grease also, which is said to be a cure for piles. %0a%3c %0a%3c A very good thing, they say, lor sciatica, is, to pound raw %0a%3c snails in Aminean 10 wine, and to take them with pepper; to %0a%3c eat a green lizard, the feet, head, and intestines being fiist %0a%3c removed; or to eat a spotted lizard, with the addition ot three %0a%3c oboli of black poppy. Ruptures and convulsions are treated %0a%3c with sheep’s gall, diluted with woman’s milk.

For the treatment of sordid %0a%3c or running ulcers of those parts, the fresh ashes of a burnt %0a%3c dog’s head are found highly useful; the small, broad kind of %0a%3c snail, beaten up in vinegar ; a snake’s slough, or the ashes of %0a%3c it, applied in vinegar; honey in which the bees have died, %0a%3c mixed with resin; or the kind of snail without a shell, that is %0a%3c found in Africa, as already 11 mentioned, beaten up with pow¬ %0a%3c dered frankincense and white of eggs, the application being %0a%3c renewed at the end of thirty days; some persons, however, %0a%3c substitute a bulb for the frankincense. %0a%3c %0a%3c For the cure of hydrocele, a spotted lizard, they say, is %0a%3c marvellously good, the head, feet, and intestines being first %0a%3c removed, and the rest of the body roasted and taken frequently %0a%3c with the food.

Wool-grease, mixed with %0a%3c woman’s milk and white lead, has a soothing effect upon gout; %0a%3c the liquid dung also voided by sheep; a sheep’s lights; a %0a%3c rain’s gall, mixed with suet; mice, split asunder and applied; %0a%3c a weasel’s blood, used as a liniment with plantago; the ashes %0a%3c of a weasel burnt alive, mixed with vinegar and oil of roses, %0a%3c and applied with a feather, or used in combination with wax %0a%3c and oil of roses; a dog’s gall, due care being taken not to touch %0a%3c it with the hand, and to apply it with a feather ; poultry dung; %0a%3c or else ashes of burnt earth-worms, applied with honey, and %0a%3c removed at the end of a couple of days. Some, however, pre¬ %0a%3c fer using this last with water, while others, again, apply the %0a%3c worms themselves, in the proportion of one acetabulum 15 to %0a%3c three cyathi of honey, the feet of the patient being first anointed %0a%3c with oil of roses. The broad, flat, kind of snail, taken in drink, %0a%3c is used for the removal of pains in the feet and joints ; two of %0a%3c them being pounded for the purpose and taken in wine. They %0a%3c are employed, also, in the form of a liniment, mixed with the %0a%3c juice of the plant helxine: 16 some, however, are content to %0a%3c beat up the snails with vinegar. Some say that salt, burnt %0a%3c in a new earthen vessel with a viper, and taken repeatedly, is %0a%3c curative of gout, and that it is an excellent plan to rub the %0a%3c feet with viper’s fat. It is asserted, too, that similar results %0a%3c are produced by keeping a kite till it is dry, and then powder¬ %0a%3c ing it and taking it in water, a pinch in three fingers at a %0a%3c time ; by rubbing the feet with the blood of that bird mixed %0a%3c with nettles; or by bruising the first feathers of a ring-dove %0a%3c with nettles. The dung of ring-doves is used as a liniment %0a%3c for pains in the joints; the ashes also of a burnt weasel, oi %0a%3c of burnt snails, mixed with amylum 17 or gum tragacanth. %0a%3c %0a%3c A very excellent cure for contusions of the joints is a spider's %0a%3c web ; but there are persons who give the preference to ashes %0a%3c of burnt cobwebs or of burnt pigeons’ dung, mixed with %0a%3c polenta and white wine.

Ulcers, free from discharge, are brought to cica¬ %0a%3c trize by using the above-named substances in combination with %0a%3c wax ; ashes, also, of burnt dormice, mixed with oil; ashes of %0a%3c burnt wood-mice, mixed with honey; ashes of burnt earth¬ %0a%3c worms, applied with old oil; or else ashes of the snails without %0a%3c a shell that are so commonly found. All ulcers on the feet are %0a%3c cured by the application of ashes of snails, burnt alive; and %0a%3c for excoriations of the feet, ashes of burnt poultry-dung are %0a%3c used, or ashes of burnt pigeons’ dung, mixed with oil. When %0a%3c the feet have been galled by the shoes, the ashes of an old shoe- %0a%3c sole are used, or the lights of a lamb or ram. For gatherings %0a%3c beneath 18 the nails, a horse’s tooth, powdered, is a sovereign %0a%3c remedy. A light application of a green lizard’s blood, will %0a%3c cure the feet of man or beast when galled beneath. %0a%3c %0a%3c For the removal of corns upon the feet, the urine of a mule %0a%3c of either sex is applied, mixed with the mud which it has %0a%3c formed upon the ground; sheep’s dung, also; the liver of a %0a%3c green lizard, or the blood of that animal, applied in wool; %0a%3c earth-worms, mixed with oil; the head of a spotted lizard, %0a%3c pounded with an equal quantity of vitex and mixed with oil; %0a%3c or pigeons’ dung, boiled with vinegar. For the cure of all kinds %0a%3c of warts, dogs’ urine is applied fresh, with the mud which it %0a%3c has formed upon the ground ; dogs’ dung, also, reduced to ashes %0a%3c and mixed with wax; sheep’s dung; the blood of mice, ap¬ %0a%3c plied fresh, or the body of a mouse, split asunder ; the gall of %0a%3c a hedgehog; a lizard’s head or blood, or the ashes of that %0a%3c animal, burnt entire; the cast-off slough of a snake; or else %0a%3c poultry dung, applied with oil and nitre. Cantharides, also, %0a%3c bruised with Taminian 19 grapes, act corrosively upon warts: %0a%3c but when warts have been thus removed, the remedies should %0a%3c be employed which we have pointed out for ulcerations on the %0a%3c skin. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 24.

According %0a%3c to what the magicians say, the gall of a male black dog is a %0a%3c counter-charm for the whole of a house; and it will be quite suffi¬ %0a%3c cient to make fumigations with it, or to use it as a purification, %0a%3c to ensure its preservation against all noxious drugs and pre¬ %0a%3c parations. They say the same, too, with reference to a dog’s %0a%3c blood, if the walls are sprinkled with it; and the genitals of %0a%3c that animal, if buried beneath the threshold. This will sur¬ %0a%3c prise persons the less who are aware how highly these same %0a%3c magicians extol that most abominable insect, the tick, and %0a%3c all because it is the only one that has no 20 passage for the %0a%3c evacuations, its eating ending only in its death, and it living all %0a%3c the longer for fasting : in this latter state it has been known %0a%3c to live so long as seven days, they say, but when it gorges to %0a%3c satiety it will burst in a much shorter period. According to %0a%3c these authorities, a tick from a dog’s left ear, worn as an %0a%3c amulet, will allay all kinds of pains. They presage, too, from %0a%3c it on matters of life and death ; for if the patient, they say, %0a%3c gives an answer to a person who has a tick about him, and, %0a%3c standing at the foot of the bed, asks how he is, it is an infal¬ %0a%3c lible sign that he will survive ; while, on the other hand, if he %0a%3c makes no answer, he will be sure to die. They add, also, that %0a%3c the dog from whose left ear the tick is taken, must be entirely %0a%3c black. Mgidius has stated in his writings that dogs will %0a%3c avoid the presence all day of a person who has taken a tick %0a%3c from off a hog. %0a%3c %0a%3c The magicians likewise assure us that patients suffering %0a%3c from delirium will recover their reason on being sprinkled %0a%3c with a mole’s blood; and that persons who are apt to be %0a%3c troubled by the gods of the night 21 and by Fuuni, will expe¬ %0a%3c rience relief by rubbing themselves morning and evening -with %0a%3c the tongue, eyes, gall, and intestines of a dragon, 22 boiled in %0a%3c oil, and cooled in the open air at night. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 25.-REMEDIES FOR COLD SHIVERIXGS. %0a%3c %0a%3c A remedy for cold shiverings, according to Meander, is a %0a%3c dead amphisbaena, 23 or its skin only, attached to the body: in %0a%3c addition to which, he informs us that if one of these reptiles %0a%3c %0a%3c 20 A popular fallacy of Pliny's time.

The %0a%3c same, too, with a green lizard, boiled down to one cyathus in %0a%3c throe sextarii of wine, and taken in doses of one spoonful %0a%3c daily, until the patient is perfectly cured; the ashes also of %0a%3c burnt snails, taken in wine. %0a%3c %0a%3c CIIAP. 27.-REMEDIES FOR EPILEPSY. %0a%3c %0a%3c For the cure of epilepsy -wool-grease is used, with a modi¬ %0a%3c cum of myrrh, a piece about the size of a hazel-nut being dis¬ %0a%3c solved and taken after the bath, in two cyathi of wine: a %0a%3c ram’s testes, also, dried and pounded, and taken in doses of %0a%3c half a denarius, in water, or in a semi-sextarius of asses’ %0a%3c milk; the patient being forbidden wine five days before and %0a%3c after using the remedy. Sheep’s blood, too, is mightily praised, %0a%3c taken in drink ; sheep’s gall, also, and lambs’ gall in particular, %0a%3c mixed with honey; the flesh of a sucking puppy, taken with %0a%3c wine and myrrh, the head and feet being first removed ; the %0a%3c callosities from a mule’s legs, taken in three cyathi of oxymel; %0a%3c the ashes of a spotted lizard from beyond seas, taken in vine¬ %0a%3c gar ; the thin coat of a spotted lizard, which it casts like a %0a%3c snake, taken in drink—indeed some persons recommend the %0a%3c lizard itself, gutted with a reed and dried and taken in drink; %0a%3c while others, again, are for roasting it on a wooden spit and %0a%3c taking it with the food. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is worth while knowing how the winter slough of this %0a%3c 21 In c. 12 of this Book.

The place to which %0a%3c it retires in summer is carefully observed, being generally some %0a%3c spot beneath the projecting parts of doors or windows, or else %0a%3c in vaults or tombs. In the early days of spring, cages made %0a%3c of split reeds are placed before these spots ; and the narrower %0a%3c the interstices the more delighted is the animal with them, %0a%3c it being all the better enabled thereby to disengage itself of %0a%3c the coat which adheres to its body and impedes its freedom of %0a%3c action: when, however, it has once quitted it, the construc¬ %0a%3c tion of the cage prevents its return. There is nothing what¬ %0a%3c ever preferred to this lizard as a remedy for epilepsy. The %0a%3c brains of a weasel are also considered very good, dried and %0a%3c taken in drink ; the liver, too, of that animal, or the testes, %0a%3c uterus, or paunch, dried and taken with coriander, in manner %0a%3c already 27 mentioned; the ashes also of a burnt weasel; or a %0a%3c wild weasel, eaten whole with the food. All these properties %0a%3c are equally attributed to the ferret. A green lizard is some¬ %0a%3c times eaten, dressed with seasonings to stimulate the appetite, %0a%3c the feet and head being first removed ; the ashes, too, of burnt %0a%3c snails are used, as an ointment, with linseed, nettle-seed, and %0a%3c honey. %0a%3c %0a%3c The magicians think highly of a dragon’s tail, attached to %0a%3c the body, with a deer’s sinews, in the skin of a gazelle; as %0a%3c also the small grits found in the crops of young swallows, %0a%3c tied to the left arm of the patient; for swallows, it is said, give %0a%3c small stones to their young the moment they are hatched. %0a%3c If, at the commencement of the first paroxysm, an epileptic %0a%3c patient eats the first of a swallow’s brood that has been %0a%3c hatched, he will experience a perfect cure: but at a later %0a%3c period the disease is treated by using swallow’s blood with %0a%3c frankincense, or by eating the heart of the bird quite ti’esh. %0a%3c Kay, even more than this, a small stone taken, from a %0a%3c swallow's nest will relieve the patient the moment it is ap¬ %0a%3c plied, they say; worn, too, as au amulet, it will alwaj s act as %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 25 See B. viii. c. 49. . %0a%3c %0a%3c 2j A cozener, cheat, or rogue.

Some recommend the breast of this bird %0a%3c to be taken in drink from a cup made of cerrus 28 wood, or the %0a%3c testes of'a dunghill cock to be taken in milk and water; the %0a%3c patient abstaining from wine the five preceding days, and the %0a%3c testes being dried for the purpose. There have been authori¬ %0a%3c ties found to recommend one-and-twenty red flies—and those %0a%3c found dead, too !—taken in drink, the number being reduced %0a%3c where the patient is of a feeble habit. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 28.

I should be inclined, %0a%3c too, to rank the ashes of the eyes of a horned owl in the num¬ %0a%3c ber of those monstrous prescriptions with which the adepts in %0a%3c the magic art abuse the credulity of mankind. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is in cases, too, of fever, more particularly, that the ac¬ %0a%3c knowledged rules of medicine run counter to the prescriptions %0a%3c of these men: for they have classified the various modes of %0a%3c treating the disease in accordance with the twelve signs of the %0a%3c Zodiac, and relatively to the revolutions of the sun and moon, %0a%3c a system which deserves to be utterly repudiated, as I shall %0a%3c prove by a few instances selected from many. They recom¬ %0a%3c mend, for example, when the sun is passing through Gemini, %0a%3c that the patient should be rubbed with ashes of the burnt %0a%3c combs, ears, and claws of cocks, beaten up and mixed with %0a%3c oil. If, again, it is the moon that is passing through that %0a%3c sign, it is the spurs and wattles of cocks that must he simi¬ %0a%3c larly employed. When either of these luminaries is passing %0a%3c through Virgo, grains of barley must be used; and when %0a%3c through Sagittarius, a bat’s wings. When the moon is pass¬ %0a%3c ing through Leo, it is leaves of tamarisk that must be employed, %0a%3c and of the cultivated tamarisk, they add: if, again, the sign %0a%3c is Aquarius, the patient must use an application of box-wood %0a%3c charcoal, pounded. %0a%3c %0a%3c Of the remedies, however, that we find recommended by %0a%3c them, I shall be careful to insert those only the efficacy %0a%3c of which has been admitted, or, at least, is probable in any %0a%3c degree; such, for instance, as the use of powerful odours, as %0a%3c an excitant for patients suffering from lethargy ; among which, %0a%3c perhaps, may be reckoned, the dried testes of a weasel, or the %0a%3c liver of that animal, burnt.

Other %0a%3c amulets are, a viper’s head, severed from the body and wrapped %0a%3c in a linen cloth; a viper’s heart, removed from the reptile %0a%3c while still alive ; the muzzle 33 of a mouse and the tips ot its %0a%3c ears, wrapped in red cloth, the animal being set at liberty %0a%3c after they are removed ; the right eye plucked from a living %0a%3c lizard, and enclosed with the head, separated from the body, %0a%3c in goat's skin ; the scarabaeus also that forms pellets 34 and rolls %0a%3c them along. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is on account of this kind of scarabaeus that the people %0a%3c of a great part of Egypt worship those insects as divinities; %0a%3c an usage for which Apion gives a curious reason, asserting, as be %0a%3c does, by way of justifying the rites of his nation, that the insect %0a%3c in its operations pictures the revolution of the suruy There is %0a%3c also another kind of scarabaeus, which the magicians recom¬ %0a%3c mend to be worn as an amulet—the one that has small horns 3 * %0a%3c thrown backwards; it must be taken up, when used for this %0a%3c purpose, with the left hand. A third kind also, known by the %0a%3c name of “ fullo,” 37 and covered with white spots, they recom¬ %0a%3c mend to be cut asunder and attached to either arm, the other %0a%3c kinds being worn upon the left arm. Other amulets recom¬ %0a%3c mended by them, are, the heart of a snake taken from the %0a%3c living animal with the left hand; or four joints of a scorpion’s %0a%3c tail, together with the sting, attached to the body in a piece of %0a%3c black cloth; due care being taken that the patient does not see %0a%3c %0a%3c 32 “ Bastard-wasp.” %0a%3c %0a%3c 33 “ Rostellum.” Holland renders it “ The little prettie snout’s end of %0a%3c a mouse.” %0a%3c %0a%3c 34 Of cowdung. It was supposed that there was no female scarabaeus, %0a%3c and that the male insect formed these balls for the reproduction of its %0a%3c species. It figures very largely in the Egyptian mythology and philosophy %0a%3c as the emblem of the creative and generative power. It has been suggested %0a%3c that its Coptic name “ akalouks” is a compound Sanscrit word, signifying %0a%3c —“ The ox-insect that collects dirt into a round mass.” See B. xi, c. 34. %0a%3c %0a%3c 36 Probably the “ lucanus ” mentioned in B. xi. c. 34; supposed to be %0a%3c the same as the stag-beetle. %0a%3c %0a%3c 37 The “ fuller,” apparently.

Some enclose a cater¬ %0a%3c pillar in a piece of linen with a thread passed three times %0a%3c round it, and tie as many knots, repeating at each knot why it %0a%3c is that the patient performs that operation. A slug is some¬ %0a%3c times wrapped in a piece of skin, or the heads of four slugs, %0a%3c cut from the body with a reed : a millepede is rolled up in %0a%3c wool: the small grubs that produce the gadfly, 38 are used %0a%3c before the wings of the insect are developed ; or any other kind %0a%3c of hairy grub is employed that is found adhering to prickly %0a%3c shrubs. Some persons attach to the body four of these grubs, %0a%3c enclosed in an empty walnut shell, or else some of the snails %0a%3c that are found without a shell. %0a%3c %0a%3c In other cases, again, it is the practice to enclose a spotted %0a%3c lizard in a little box, and to place it beneath the pillow of the %0a%3c patient, taking care to set it at liberty when the fever abates. %0a%3c It is recommended also, that the patient should swallow the %0a%3c heart of a sea-diver, removed from the bird without the aid of %0a%3c iron, it being first dried and then bruised and taken in warm %0a%3c water. The heart of a swallow is also recommended, with %0a%3c honey; and there are persons who say that, just before the %0a%3c paroxysms come on, the patient should take one drachma of %0a%3c swallow’s dung in three cyathi of goats’ milk or ewes’ milk, %0a%3c or of raisin wine : others, again, are of opinion that the birds %0a%3c themselves should be taken, whole. The nations of Parthia, %0a%3c as a remedy for quartan fevers, take the skin of the asp, in %0a%3c doses of one sixth of a denarius, with an equal quantity of %0a%3c pepper. The philosopher Chrysippus has left a statement to %0a%3c the effect, that the phryganion, 39 worn as an amulet, is a %0a%3c remedy for quartan fevers; but what kind of animal this is he %0a%3c has nowhere informed us, nor have I been able to meet with %0a%3c any one who knows. Still, however, I felt myself bound to %0a%3c notice a remedy that was mentioned by an author of such high %0a%3c repute, in case any other person should happen to be more %0a%3c successful in his researches. To eat the flesh of a crow, and %0a%3c %0a%3c 38 See B. xi. c. 38. . , , , %0a%3c %0a%3c 39 Some suppose that this was an insect that lived among dry wood, %0a%3c and derive the name from the Greek %3cppvyavbv.

Very considerable, too, is the efficacy of lights, %0a%3c ram’s lights in particular, which are of the greatest utility tor %0a%3c reducing and making level the fleshy excrescences formed by %0a%3c ulcerous sores. With sheep’s dung, warmed beneath an %0a%3c earthen pan and kneaded, the swellings attendant upon wounds %0a%3c are reduced, and fistulous sores and epinyctis are cleansed and %0a%3c made to heal. %0a%3c %0a%3c But it is in the ashes of a burnt dog s head that the %0a%3c greatest efficacy is found; as it quite equals spodiunfl 3 in %0a%3c its property of cauterizing all kinds of fleshy excrescences, %0a%3c and causing sores to heal. Mouse-dung, too, is used as a %0a%3c cautery, and weasels’ dung, burnt to ashes. Pounded mille¬ %0a%3c pedes, mixed with turpentine and earth of Sinope ,' 16 are used %0a%3c for penetrating carcinomata and fleshy indurations in deep- %0a%3c seated sores ; and the same substances are remarkably useful %0a%3c for the treatment of ulcers threatened with maggots. %0a%3c %0a%3c Indeed the several varieties of worms themselves are pos¬ %0a%3c sessed of marvellously useful properties. Ihe worms, lor %0a%3c instance, that breed in wood are curative of all kinds of ulcers : %0a%3c reduced to ashes, with an equal quantity of anise, and applied %0a%3c with oil, they heal cancerous sores. Earthworms are so remark¬ %0a%3c ably healing for wounds recently inflicted, that it is a very %0a%3c general belief that by the end of seven days they will unite %0a%3c sinews even that have been cut asunder : hence it is that it is re¬ %0a%3c commended to keep them preserved in honey. Ashes of burnt %0a%3c earth-worms, in combination with tar or Simblian honey, cau¬ %0a%3c terize the indurated margins of ulcerous sores.

For %0a%3c the malignant ulcer known as “ cacoethes,” 64 the ashes of a %0a%3c ram’s thigh-bones are used, mixed with woman’s milk, the sores %0a%3c being washed with linen cloths well rinsed. For the same %0a%3c purpose, the bird known as the screech-owl 55 is boiled in oil, %0a%3c ewe-milk butter and honey being added to the preparation, %0a%3c when properly dissolved. An application of bees that have %0a%3c died in the honey, acts emolliently upon the indurated margins %0a%3c of ulcerous sores; and for the cure of elephantiasis, the blood %0a%3c and ashes of a weasel are employed.

Milk, taken as a drink, %0a%3c strengthens the loins of women when in travail. Mouse-dung, %0a%3c diluted with rain water, reduces the breasts of females, when %0a%3c swollen after delivery. The ashes of a burnt hedge-hog, %0a%3c applied with oil, act as a preventive of abortion. Delivery is %0a%3c facilitated, in cases where the patient has taken, either goose- %0a%3c dung in two cyathi of water, or the liquid that escapes from %0a%3c the uterus of a weasel by its genitals. %0a%3c %0a%3c Earth-worms, applied topically, effectually prevent pains in %0a%3c the sinews of the neck and shoulders; taken in raisin wine, %0a%3c they expel the after-birth, when retarded. Applied by them¬ %0a%3c selves, earthworms ripen abscesses of the breasts, open them, %0a%3c draw the humours, and make them cicatrize : taken in honied %0a%3c wine, they promote the secretion of the milk. In hay-grass there %0a%3c are small worms found, which, attached to the neck, act as a %0a%3c preventive of premature delivery; they are removed, however, %0a%3c at the moment of childbirth, as otherwise they would have the %0a%3c effect of impeding delivery; care must be taken, also, not to put %0a%3c 56 In B. xxviii. c. 77. 67 “ Fieri.” %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 44.] METnODS OF FACILITATING DELIVERY. 463 %0a%3c %0a%3c them on the ground. To promote conception, five or seven of %0a%3c them are administered in drink. Snails, taken with the food, %0a%3c accelerate delivery; and, applied with saffron, they promote %0a%3c conception. Used in the form of a liniment, with amylum 68 %0a%3c and gum tragacanth, they arrest uterine discharges. Taken %0a%3c with the food, they promote menstruation ; and, mixed with %0a%3c deer’s marrow, in the proportion of one denarius and the same %0a%3c quantity of Cyprus 59 to each snail, they reduce the uterus when %0a%3c displaced. Taken from the shell, and beaten up with oil of %0a%3c roses, they dispel inflations of the uterus; the snails of Asty- %0a%3c palaea being those that are mostly chosen for these purposes. %0a%3c %0a%3c Those of Africa, again, are employed in a different manner, %0a%3c two of them being beaten up with a pinch of fenugreek in %0a%3c three fingers, and four spoonfuls of honey, and the preparation %0a%3c applied to the abdomen, after it has been rubbed with juice of %0a%3c iris. 60 There is a kind of small, white, elongated snail, 61 that %0a%3c is found stra 5 'ing here and there : dried upon tiles in the sun, %0a%3c and reduced to powder, these snails are mixed with bean-meal, %0a%3c in equal proportions, forming a cosmetic which whitens and %0a%3c softens the skin. The small, broad, kind of snail, mixed with %0a%3c polenta, is good for the removal of a tendency to scratch and %0a%3c rub the skin. %0a%3c %0a%3c If a pregnant woman steps over a viper, she will be sure to %0a%3c miscarry ; 62 the same, too, in the case of the amphisboena, but %0a%3c only when it is dead. If, however, a woman carries about her a %0a%3c live amphisbcena in a box, she may step over one with impu¬ %0a%3c nity, even though it be dead. An amphisbmna, preserved for %0a%3c the purpose, will ensure an easy delivery, even though it be %0a%3c dead. 63 It is a truly marvellous fact, but if a pregnant woman %0a%3c steps over one of these serpents that has not been preserved, it %0a%3c will be perfectly harmless, provided she immediately steps %0a%3c over another that has been preserved. A fumigation made %0a%3c with a dried snake, acts powerfully as an emmenagogue. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 44. -METHODS OF FACILITATING DELIVERY. %0a%3c %0a%3c The cast-off slough of a snake, attached to the loins, facili- %0a%3c %0a%3c ss See B xviii. c. 17. 69 See B. xii. c. 51. 60 See B. xxi. cc. 19, S3. %0a%3c %0a%3c si y arr0 calls them “ albulne,” and says that they were found at lleate. %0a%3c %0a%3c 62 Of course she will he liable to do so, from fright. %0a%3c %0a%3c 63 The whole of this account appears to be in a very confused state, and %0a%3c is probably corrupt.

The shells of par¬ %0a%3c tridges’ eggs, burnt to ashes and mixed with cadmia 69 and %0a%3c wax, preserve the firmness 70 of the breasts. It is generally %0a%3c thought, that if the egg of a partridge or * * * is passed %0a%3c three times round a woman’s breasts, they will never become %0a%3c flaccid; and that, if these eggs are swallowed, they will be %0a%3c productive of fruitfulness, and promote the plentiful secretion %0a%3c %0a%3c 64 Ajasson has wasted ten lines of indignation upon the question where %0a%3c such a staff is to be found ! %0a%3c %0a%3c 65 See c. 16 of this Book. 66 See B. xxxvi. c. 39. %0a%3c %0a%3c 67 An impossibility.

It is generally thought, too, that bats’ %0a%3c brains are productive of a similar effect; there being two kinds %0a%3c of these brains, the red and the white. Some persons mix %0a%3c with the brains the blood and liver of the same animal: others, %0a%3c again, boil down a viper in three semisextarii of oil, and, after %0a%3c boning it, use it as a depilatory, first pulling out the hairs %0a%3c that are wanted not to grow. The gall of a hedgehog is a %0a%3c depilatory, more particularly if mixed with bats’ brains and %0a%3c goats’ milk : the ashes, too, of a burnt hedgehog are used for a %0a%3c similar purpose. If, after plucking out the hairs that are %0a%3c wanted not to grow, or if, before they make their appearance, %0a%3c the parts are well rubbed with the milk of a bitch with her %0a%3c first litter, no hairs will grow there. The same result is en¬ %0a%3c sured, it is said, by using the blood of a tick taken from off a %0a%3c dog, or else the blood or gall of a swallow. %0a%3c %0a%3c (15.) Ants’ eggs, they say, beaten up with flies, impart a %0a%3c black colour 72 to the eyebrows.

The %0a%3c inflammation called “ siriasis,” 73 * to which infants are liable, is %0a%3c cured by attaching to them the bones that are found in the %0a%3c dung of dogs. Hernia in infants is cured by letting a green %0a%3c lizard bite the child’s body while asleep, after which the lizard %0a%3c is attached to a reed, and hung up in the smoke; by the time %0a%3c the animal dies, the child will bo perfectly cured, it is said. %0a%3c The slime of snails, applied to the eyes of children, straightens %0a%3c the eyelashes, and makes them grow. Ashes of burnt snails, %0a%3c applied with frankincense and juice of white grapes, are a cure %0a%3c for hernia [in infants], if applied for thirty days consecutively. %0a%3c Within the horns 71 of snails, there are certain hard substances %0a%3c found, like grits of sand : attached to infants, they facilitate %0a%3c dentition. %0a%3c %0a%3c Ashes of empty snail-shells, mixed with wax, are a pre¬ %0a%3c ventive of procidence of the rectum ; but they must be used %0a%3c i'l combination with the matter that exudes from a viper’s %0a%3c brains, on the head being pricked. Vipers’ brains, attached to %0a%3c the infant’s body in a piece of skin, facilitate dentition, a simi¬ %0a%3c lar effect being produced by using the larger teeth of. serpents. %0a%3c Havens’ dung, attached to an infant with wool, is curative of %0a%3c cough. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is hardly possible to preserve one’s seriousness in describing %0a%3c some of these remedies, but as they have been transmitted to %0a%3c us, I must not pass them in silence. For the treatment of %0a%3c hernia in infants, a lizard is recommended ; but it must be a %0a%3c male lizard, a thing that may be ascertained by its having but %0a%3c one orifice beneath the tail. The method of proceeding, is for %0a%3c the lizard to bite the part affected through cloth of gold, cloth %0a%3c of silver, and cloth dyed purple; after which it is tied fast in a %0a%3c cup that has never been used, and smoked. Incontinence of %0a%3c urine in infants is checked by giving them boiled mice 74 with %0a%3c their food. The large indented horns of the scarabaeus, attached %0a%3c to the bodies of infants, have all the virtues of an amulet. In %0a%3c the head of the boa 76 there is a small stone, they say, which %0a%3c the serpent spits out, when it is in fear of death : if the reptile %0a%3c is taken by surprise, and the head cut off, and this stone ex- %0a%3c %0a%3c 73 * Supposed to be an inflammation of the membranes of the brain. %0a%3c %0a%3c 74 See c. 8 of this Book. %0a%3c %0a%3c 75 A remedy stilll used, Ajasson says, in the French provinces. %0a%3c %0a%3c 7 * See B. viii. c. 14, and B. xxix. c. 38. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 49.] APHRODISIACS AND ANT APHRODISIACS. 467 %0a%3c %0a%3c tracted, it will aid dentition to a marvellous degree, attached %0a%3c to the neck of infants. The brains, too, of the same serpent %0a%3c are recommended to be attached to the body for a similar pur¬ %0a%3c pose, as also the small stone or bone that is found in the back %0a%3c of the slug. %0a%3c %0a%3c An admirable promoter of dentition is found in sheep’s %0a%3c brains, applied to the gums ; and equally good for diseases of %0a%3c the ears, is an application of goose-grease, with juice of ocimum. %0a%3c Upon prickly plants there is found a kind of rough, hairy, %0a%3c grub: attached to the neck of infants, these insects give instant %0a%3c relief, it is said, when any of the food has stuck in the throat. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 48. -PROVOCATIVES OF SLEEP. %0a%3c %0a%3c As a soporific, wool-grease is employed, diluted in two %0a%3c cyathi of wine with a modicum of myrrh, or else mixed with %0a%3c goose-grease and myrtle wine. For a similar purpose also, a %0a%3c cuckoo is attached to the body in a hare’s skin, or a young %0a%3c heron’s bill to the forehead in an ass’s skin : it is thought, too, %0a%3c that the beak alone, steeped in wine, is equally efficacious. On %0a%3c the other hand, a bat’s head, dried and worn as an amulet, acts %0a%3c as a preventive of sleep. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAr. 49. -APHRODISIACS AND ANTAPHRODISIACS. %0a%3c %0a%3c A lizard drowned in a man’s urine has the effect of an ant- %0a%3c aphrodisiac upon the person whose urine it is; for this animal %0a%3c is to be reckoned among the philtres, the magicians say. The %0a%3c same property is attributed to the excrements of snails, and to %0a%3c pigeons’ dung, taken with oil and wine. The right lobe of a %0a%3c vulture’s lungs, attached to the body in the skin of a crane, %0a%3c acts powerfully as a stimulant upon males : an effect equally %0a%3c produced by taking the yolks of five pigeons’ eggs, in honey, %0a%3c mixed with one denarius of hog’s lard; sparrows, or eggs of %0a%3c sparrows, with the food ; or by wearing the right testicle of a %0a%3c cock, attached to the body in a ram’s skin. The ashes of a %0a%3c burnt ibis, it is said, employed as a friction with goose-grease %0a%3c and oil of iris, will prevent abortion when a female has once %0a%3c conceived ; while the testes of a game-cock, on the other hand, %0a%3c rubbed with goose-grease and attached to the body in a ram s %0a%3c skin, have all the effect of an antaphrodisiac: the same, too, %0a%3c with the testes of any kind of dunghill cock, placed, together %0a%3c with the blood of a cock, beneath the bed.

It is asserted, too, that if the ashes of %0a%3c a burnt weasel are mixed with the cramming for chickens or %0a%3c young pigeons, they will be safe from the attacks of weasels. %0a%3c Beasts of burden, when troubled with pains in staling, find %0a%3c immediate relief, if a bat is attached to tho body ; and they are %0a%3c effectually cured of bots by passing a ring-dove three times %0a%3c round their generative parts—a truly marvellous thing to relate, %0a%3c the ring-dove, on being set at liberty, dies, and the beast is in¬ %0a%3c stantly relieved from pain. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 51.-REMEDIES FOR INTOXICATION. %0a%3c %0a%3c The eggs of an owlet, administered to drunkards three days %0a%3c in wine, are productive of a distaste for that liquor.

Some authors state that there is a bird in %0a%3c Sardinia, resembling the crane and called the “ gromphena ;” 81 %0a%3c but it is no longer known even by the people of that country, %0a%3c in my opinion. In the same province, too, there is the ophion, %0a%3c an animal which resembles the deer in the hair only, and to be %0a%3c found 8 ' 2 nowhere else. The same authors have spoken also of %0a%3c the “ subjugus,” 83 but have omitted to state what animal it is, %0a%3c or where it is to be found. That it did formerly exist, however, %0a%3c I have no doubt, as certain remedies are described as being %0a%3c derived from it. M.

A dog %0a%3c will not bark at a person who has any part of the secundines %0a%3c of a bitch about him, or a hare’s dung or fur. The kind of %0a%3c gnats called “ muliones,” 85 do not live more than a single day. %0a%3c Persons when taking honey from the hives, will never be %0a%3c touched by the bees if they carry the beak of a wood-pecker 86 %0a%3c about them. Swine will be sure to follow the person who has %0a%3c given them a raven’s brains, made up into a bolus. The dust %0a%3c in which a she-mule has wallowed, sprinkled upon the body, %0a%3c will allay the flames of desire. Eats may be put to flight by %0a%3c castrating a male rat, and setting it at liberty. If a snake s %0a%3c slough is beaten up with some spelt, salt, and wild thyme, and %0a%3c introduced into the throat of oxen, with wine, at the time %0a%3c that grapes are ripening, they will be in perfect health for a %0a%3c whole year to come : the same, too, if three young swallows are %0a%3c given to them, made up into three boluses.
