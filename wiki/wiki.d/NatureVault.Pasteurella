I think I born in 86 got it in the womb (umbilical cord wrapped around neck) and my brother born in 89 got it in birth canal and needed [[ears]] tubes and also intestinal surgery for [[cyanosis]].

I have a suspicion that [[vitamin d]], [[folic acid]], and [[cobalamin]] do too but haven't been tested.  We know [[phosphorus]] supplementation is detrimental to pasteurella, but folic acid upregulates p38 MAPK phosphorylation so might be detrimental in a pasteurella infection since pasteuella PMT toxin uses that pathway [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1866365/|#]] to damage heart cells.%0a%0aPasteurella has a virulence factor of iron regulation [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7150361/|#]] which means it could cause anything from [[anemia]] to [[hemochromatosis]].  Also has hyaluronic acid which prevents phagocytosis. Also complment activated serum bactericidal opsonization.  Also produce leukotoxic enzymes.
