Since we know virus survival after water treatment is reduced above 68f/20c [[https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.04.20122218v1.full.pdf|#]] and LA is warmer than NYC, LA wastewater is probably nearly equivalent to the insufficiently treated NYC water.%0a%0aA couple anecdotes; when I lived in LA I caught coronavirus from an open window during the rain.  I chalked it up to bieng in chemtrails and getting rained out which is possible, but it is also possible from viruses in wastewater to be aeresolized [[ https://www.researchgate.net/publication/301639514_Survivability_Partitioning_and_Recovery_of_Enveloped_Viruses_in_Untreated_Municipal_Wastewater|#]] especially in the rain and wind coming from santa monica where the waste is discharged.

I am not a medical doctor but I am a researcher and have spent 20 years researching natural health and how the body works.%0a%3c %0a%3c A couple points or questions I have for you is have you considered using ubiquinone (coq10) as a zinc ionophore?  The research I have seen puts that above EGCG.  Also coq10 gives energy to the cells especially heart cells which is a nice side effect.  I realize cost may be a factor.%0a%3c %0a%3c Secondly take a look at Serpins as anti-inflamatories.  These are often mutated and stress can deplete them in the body.  Raw quail egg (or pollen block from infowars) has serpins that can help the human body reverse inflammation.%0a%3c %0a%3c Thirdly phosphorus is very important to getting rid of bacteria and mucus in the lungs.  I use emergen-c hydration+ and that has made the most improvement at getting rid of a persistant cough after covid. %0a%3c @]%0a
