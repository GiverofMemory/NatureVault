csum=!![[Gold production]] recipe   !!Analysis  you make iron sulfide FeS, heat with salt, vinegar, honey (carbon)  the carbon and iron sulfide makes hydrogen sulfide, the iron sulfide and vinegar makes chelated iron(iii)oxide, the salt is dielectric  The hydrogen sulfide charges the salt which creates oxygen vacancies and muon collapse in the chelated iron oxide.
