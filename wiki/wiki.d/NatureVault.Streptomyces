This could also explain things like [[pyramids]] which use [[electrohydrodynamics]] to produce alkaline water, or perhaps other alkaline water sources with healing or growth promoting powers like pyramid lake [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramid_Lake_(Nevada)|#]]  A monk or priest who healed people has people use earth from over his grave to heal people, and people must put the dirt back afterwards.  They tested it and found streptomyces.
