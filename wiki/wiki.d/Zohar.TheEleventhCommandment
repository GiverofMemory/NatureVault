text=The Eleventh Commandment %0a%0a%0a%0a244. The eleventh Mitzva is to give a tithe of the fruits of the earth. Here %0athere are two M.itzvoU to separate a tithe of the fruits of the earth, and to %0abring the first fruits of the trees, as it is written, "Behold, I have given you %0aevery herb-yielding seed, which is upon the face of all the earth" (Beresheet, %0a1:29). Here it is written, I HAVE GIVEN YOU. Elsewhere it is written, "And %0ato the children of Levi, behold, I have given all the tithe in Israel" (Bamidbar, %0a18:21). It is also written, "And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of %0athe land or of the fruit of the tree, is the Creator's" (Vayikra, 27:30). %0a%0aThese verses say that the Creator gave everything to Adam. Yet, why does %0athat oblige us to separate a tithe, to bring the first fruits of the earth, and why are %0awe forbidden from eating them? After all, this contradicts the aforesaid. %0a%0aThe thing is that the process of (spiritual) nourishment includes exposure, %0aselection, and separation of the holy sparks of the Light from the impure forces. %0aIn the process of feeding (reception of Light), the sparks of the Light (Nitzotzin) %0athat are contained in the food unite with man's soul, with his very flesh, and the %0awaste, except for the sparks, leaves the body. This continues throughout man's %0alife (6,000 degrees of ascent); he gradually accumulates within him all the holy %0asparks, with which he complements his soul. Without them, the soul cannot %0aattain completeness and perfection. %0a%0aI think that the reader already understands that The Zohar in no way speaks %0aabout the process of feeding, digestion, and secretion of our physical body. As %0athe whole of the Torah, The Zohar speaks only of the goal of creation and the %0aways of its attainment. Therefore, I call upon the reader (in defiance of what his %0amind suggests to him after the first reading) to realize that these texts are written %0ain the language of branches, when spiritual objects are described in the language %0aof our world; yet, despite the corporeal language, the objects remain spiritual! %0a%0a445 %0a%0a%0a%0a446 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aIt is written in the weekly portion Lech Lecha that Adam was forbidden to %0aeat meat: "I have given you every herb..." (Beresheet, 1:29). However, since Adam %0asinned, and egoism, impurity entered his body, it was said to Noah: "Every %0amoving thing that lives shall be for food for you; as the green herb have I given %0ayou all" (Beresheet, 9:3), that is, including meat. %0a%0aSince Adam was created in absolute perfection, everything was sorted and %0acorrected within him, which corresponds to the animate part of creation, as it %0ais written (Beresheet, 2:19): "Out of the ground the Creator formed every beast %0aof the field," and also, "whatsoever the man would call every living creature, %0athat was to be the name thereof." This means that Adam attained every name %0a(spiritual level) of the animal souls, for the pure forces were already separated %0afrom the impure ones. %0a%0aHence, Adam was not given the task of exposing, sorting, and correcting %0aanimals by eating them, for even before the creation of man, the Creator %0acorrected this in the world of Atzilut. And only the inanimate and vegetative %0a(parts of the soul) remained uncorrected, containing both pure and impure %0aforces. Therefore, Adam was instructed to expose the sparks that his soul lacked %0ain the inanimate and vegetative food. %0a%0aHowever, as a result of Adam's sin, pure and impure desires (forces) were %0amixed once more. And as Adam's soul was shattered into many parts, all %0aof which fell into the impure forces, all the animals (animate desires) were %0acorrupted along with him (with the human level of desire). Thus appeared the %0aneed to expose, sort, and correct them. Therefore, after the sin the Creator %0aordered Adam and the subsequent generations to eat animals, and thus extract %0athe sparks from impurity. %0a%0aIt is said that Adam was created IN THE IMAGE AND AFTER LIKENESS, %0ai.e., with the help of the T^eLeM Elokim, the Light of Bina, by the four passages %0afrom the Torah in the Tefillin. And this is his soul. However, after he was born %0awith this holy soul, thanks to his good deeds, he merited raising MAN and %0areceiving Ohr Haya, and then, on Shabbat, attaining Ohr Yechida as well. %0a%0aTherefore, Adam was left to correct the creation with the help of only a tithe %0aand offerings. And by feeding on tithe and offerings, he attained the revelation %0aof his desires and raised MAN to the level of Ohr Haya and Yechida. Yet, after %0ahe sinned, all of his corrections and everything that had filled his soul was %0acorrupted, mixed, and egoism took over the body. %0a%0aDue to our egoism, tithe and offerings are forbidden for us, for fear that we %0awill desire Supernal purity. Instead, we are obliged to extract and pass them on %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Eleventh Commandment %0a%0a%0a%0a447 %0a%0a%0a%0ato the Cohanim and Levi'im (parts of the soul). And if we observe this Creator's %0aMitzva of spiritually separating a tithe of the fruits of the earth and the offerings %0a(as He commanded), we will receive the strength to raise MAN and receive Ohr %0aHaya on Shabbat (the ascent of the worlds is called Shabbat) in the same way that %0aAdam attained this state while feeding on tithe and offerings. %0a%0aThus, after man receives Ohr Neshama by putting on the Tefillin, he can raise %0aMAN with the help of the two Mitzvot (tithe and offerings) in order to receive %0aOhr Haya. As it is explained, Adam was receiving Ohr Haya by feeding on tithe %0aand offerings. However, we are forbidden to feed on them (to try to receive %0athis Light for the Creator's sake) because of the egoism that acts in our body %0a(desires). Instead, we are bid to give a tithe and the offerings to the Cohanim and %0athe Levi'im. As a result, we receive the strength to receive this Light. %0a
