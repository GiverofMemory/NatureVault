If elevated homocysteine causes elevated histamine then lowering homocysteine via [[folic acid]] then you would expect folic acid to lower [[heartburn]] which is from elevated gut histamine.  I have noticed this effect. The mechanism may be that homocysteine inhibits [[diamine oxide]] (DAO) [[https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/85/5/1185/4633007|#]], and DAO lowers histamine production from dietary histidine.  So [[folic acid]] lowers homocysteine which increases DAO.%0a%0a[[Zinc]] is an essential part of the [[folic acid]] pathway [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4975278/|#]]%0a%0a!!!CSF [[homocysteine]]%0aCsf homocysteine elevated but not blood in [[chronic fatigue]] and [[fibromyalgia]] [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4406448/|#]]%0a!!Sleep%0aSleep duration either increased from normal or decreased ([[insomnia]] or [[hypersomnia]]) in cases of high homocysteine.
