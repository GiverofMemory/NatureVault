text=(:nogroupheader:)%0aH pylori is a [[bacteria]] responsible for migraines and [[cancer]] of many types including stomach, lung, and pancreas amoung others.  It also is implicated in tooth root abcesses and many other problems.  Its infections are usually painless but they can become coinfected with [[serratia]] causing redness and extreme pain.  %0a%0a[[#heartburn]]%0a!!Heartburn and Acid reflux and GERD [[#heartburn]]%0a%0a[[H pylori]] causes [[non-acidic reflux]].  This is from its attack of the stomach mucosa which incites the stomach to produce mucus and reflux.  H pylori produces ammonia which is alkaline.  Coinfection with [[histamine]] producing bacteria like [[enterobacter]],[[e coli]], [[klebsiella]], [[lactobacillus]] and [[leuconostoc]] cause acid production so the combination of h pylori and one of these bacteria are responsible for acidic reflux, [[heartburn]].%0a%0a!!!Heartburn treatment%0a[[Garlic]] usually works and this is likely when it is caused by [[e coli]] [[https://plantmedicines.org/garlic-and-ginger-found-to-inhibit-superbugs/|#]] .

For [[leuconostoc]] which is the bacteria in [[saurkraut]], [[adaptogens]] work like [[ginseng]], [[gynostemma]], and [[tribulus]]%0a%0a[[Lactobacillus]] found in [[banana]]s also cause [[histamine]] production and therefore excess acid production.%0a%0a[[Cinnamon]] essential oil might be most effective verses all 3 types that can cause heartburn [[https://academic.oup.com/ofid/article/6/12/ofz502/5652487|#]].%0a%0aSupplemental [[phosphorus]] via [[phosphate repletion]] seems to help me presumably since it acts as a buffer.%0a!![[Chronic fatigue]]%0aCauses chronic fatigue by upregulating [[PGE2]] (along with [[haemophilus]]) which causes reduced [[cellular immunity]] which causes growth of [[intracellular bacteria]] which cause [[chronic fatigue]].%0a!!Mast Cells%0a%0aCagA negative h pylori associated with higher tryptase (diagnostic of mast cell disease) but not to a large degree it seems.
