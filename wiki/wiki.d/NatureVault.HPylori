It also is implicated in tooth root abcesses and many other problems.  Its infections are usually painless but they can become coinfected with [[serratia]] causing redness and extreme pain.  %0a%0a[[#heartburn]]%0a!!Heartburn and Acid reflux and GERD [[#heartburn]]%0a%0a[[H pylori]] causes [[non-acidic reflux]].  This is from its attack of the stomach mucosa which incites the stomach to produce mucus and reflux.  H pylori produces ammonia which is alkaline.  Coinfection with [[histamine]] producing bacteria like [[enterobacter]],[[e coli]], [[klebsiella]], [[lactobacillus]] and [[leuconostoc]] cause acid production so the combination of h pylori and one of these bacteria are responsible for acidic reflux, [[heartburn]].%0a%0a!!!Heartburn treatment%0a[[Garlic]] usually works and this is likely when it is caused by [[e coli]] [[https://plantmedicines.org/garlic-and-ginger-found-to-inhibit-superbugs/|#]] .
