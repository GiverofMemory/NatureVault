text=The Thirteenth Commandment %0a%0a%0a%0a246. The thirteenth hlitzva is to perform the redemption of a first-born son so %0aas to strengthen him in life. For there are two appointed angels in charge— one %0aover life and one over death. And they both rule over man from Above. And %0awhen man redeems his son, he redeems him from the angel in charge of death, %0aso that the angel can no longer govern the first-born son. Hence, it is written, %0aAND THE CREATOR SAW EVERYTHING THAT HE HAD MADE-this %0ais in general, AND, BEHOLD, IT WAS... VERY GOOD alludes to the angel %0aof life, while the word VERY alludes to the angel of death. Therefore, by this %0aact of redemption, the angel of life is strengthened and the angel of death is %0aweakened. Life is purchased by this redemption, for the evil side leaves him be %0aand clings to him no more. %0a%0aThe ascent of the worlds occurred on the sixth day of creation: ZA ascended %0ato the place of AA, Malchut ascended to AVI, and Adam attained Ohr Haya. As %0aa result, the angel of death (egoism) lost his power completely. On the contrary, %0ahe became very good, for upon being corrected, egoism becomes a great and %0aholy Kli, the one Kli that can receive the greatest Light. %0a%0aSuch a state will come at the end of the general correction, when, due to the %0arevelation of this great Light, death (egoism) will disappear forever. This is the %0ameaning of the verse: "when the Creator saw EVERYTHING that He had made %0a(i.e., at the end of all creation), He saw that it was very good." %0a%0aHowever, since Adam's sin, the worlds can no longer ascend as high. This %0ais why we need special Mitzvot in order to perform special preparations and %0aactions for the reception of Ohr Haya, at least in a state called Shabbat. This %0ais precisely the Mitzva to redeem one's first-born son, when we weaken the %0apowers of the angel of death and strengthen the angel of life, much like what %0athe Creator did to Adam by the preliminary ascents of all the worlds, for %0a%0a451 %0a%0a%0a%0a452 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aduring such an ascent, called Shabbat, the angel of death becomes very good. %0aSuch is the power of that Mitzva. %0a%0aYet, it is not observed as fully as previously, when the angel of death lost %0aall of his power. Now, by observing the Mitzva of redemption of the first-born %0ason, we merely distance from the angel of death without actually destroying the %0aimpure forces, and they no longer cling to him. And after preventing the impure %0aforces from clinging, accomplished with the help of this Mitzva, he can receive %0alife, i.e., Ohr Haya of the state of Shabbat.
