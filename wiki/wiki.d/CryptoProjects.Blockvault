text=(:Summary:Blockvault is a blockchain that instead of focusing on storing financial transactions or even contracts, rather stores data like a wiki:)%0a(:Published:dec 10 2021:)%0a(:Author:[[~GiverofMemory]]:)%0a(:License:[[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Res_communis|Site License]]:)%0a(:Update:dec 14 2021:)%0a(:Maintainer:[[~GiverofMemory]]:)%0a(:Creator:[[]]:)%0a(:Categories:[[!Cryptics]]:)%0a(:Also:none:)%0a(:Archive:[[https://archive.md/1UeGH|Archive.is]], [[https://web.archive.org/web/20211217023208/https://www.naturevault.org/wiki/pmwiki.php/CryptoProjects/Blockvault|Archive.org]]:)%0a(:Download:[[{$FullName}?action=print|URL]],[[https://www.web2pdfconvert.com/|PDF from URL]]:)%0a%0aBlockvault is a blockchain that stores information.  The information can be readable by everyone, readable by computers (code), or encrypted by the person writing it.  %0a%0aWriting started as financial accounting "tokens" [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_writing#Recorded_history|#]] but today it is so much more than that.  Thus with Bitcoin and Ethereum, blockchain started as financial accounting and tokens, but with Blockvault, blockchain becomes so much more.%0a%0aBlockvault is a website host, social media platform, wiki, messenger, forum, even in-game chat, etc all in one.  It is an unimpeachable data host platform in which websites like those listed above can use and curate from.%0a%0aBlockvault is basically an entirely new internet protocol. It is a new internet, one that everyone can own and hold in the [[#block|palm of their hand]].%0a!!Goal%0a%25rfloat%25Attach:blockvault.png | [[#block|"The Block"]] emitting its data when hit with concentrated sunlight%0aThe goal of blockvault is to be a modern day library of alexandria where important information can be stored and hopefully be preserved for future generations.  Hard drives will fail.  Data will be corrupted.  But if everyone is independently storing the same information, some might do it in very robust and protected ways (EMP hardened) then chances are the information will be preserved.  Bieng a millenial and straddling libraries and the internet in my lifetime, I don't want to see the earth shattering amount of information on the internet to be lost.  Currently the way information is stored on the internet (each webpage is stored on a single server somewhere) all will eventually be lost. And so much has been lost already ([[http://www.oocities.org/#gsc.tab=0|geocities]], myspace, angelfire, AIM, and likely millions of personally hosted sites)%0a%0a!!!Certainty%0a%0aWith blockvault the exact time of publishing will be known with total certainty (down to about 7 seconds).  Also authorship can be determined with total certainty but also anonymity.  If you can sign for the page's private key, you are the author.%0a%0a!!!Information archive%0a%0aArchive.org and Archive.is attempt to preserve as much of the internet as they can, but of course it is centralized and if they ever went down, were hacked, natural disaster wipes out their drives, it would all be lost as well.  By virtue of being centralized they are subject to takedown requests (censorship).  Also these groups can never even hope to archive the entire internet, or train their crawlers to save the "most important" information.%0a%0a!!!Anonymity%0a%0aUnlike wikipdia or other websites, blockvault contributers have no information about themselves recorded.  No ip address, location, browser data, device identifiers, etc. are recorded.  Nothing besides the persons private key signature, which verifies they are authorized to edit the page, is saved.%0a%0a!!!Censorship-proof%0aLike all blockchains, data cannot be deleted from blockvault without the authors permission. And even if it is "deleted" there will still be a record of the original content, what was deleted, when it was deleted, and who deleted it (public key), etc. So restoring it is an easy matter.%0a%0a!!Comparisons%0a%0aIn trying to understand what blockvault is, it is useful to compare it to other solutions out there.%0a%0a!!!Predecessors and competitors%0a%0a!!!!Bluesky%0aBlueSky, likely one of the reasons Jack Dorsey left twitter is an open source protocol for social media (probably at his rebranded "Block" company), and may use blockchain to store the social media posts [[https://bravenewcoin.com/insights/jack-dorsey-plans-open-source-social-media-protocol|#]] Other open source social media protocols exist.  Also other blockchains support posts and messages.%0a%0aBlockvault intends to be a de-facto content host, whose data websites (block explorers) use and curate for their own purposes.%0a!!!!Filecoin%0aFilecoin [[https://docs.filecoin.io/about-filecoin/how-filecoin-works/|#]] does not intend to be a permanent immutable storage of data.  In fact as a person wanting to store data, you have to pay for how long you want the data stored and only one filecoin miner will store it.  Also with a gas fee system like ethereum [[https://docs.filecoin.io/about-filecoin/how-filecoin-works/#gas-fees|#]], things will likely be much more expensive than typical web hosting, for little benefit over traditional methods [[https://docs.filecoin.io/about-filecoin/why-filecoin/|#]]. Siacoin and storj are similar. With blockvault you have permanent storage on the blockchain for a very low one time fee and every miner and verifying node on the network will host it forever for free.%0a!!!!Safenetwork[[#safenetwork]]%0aSafenetwork [[https://safenetwork.tech/how-it-works/|#]] only requires a one time storage fee unlike filecoin, but is similar to filecoin in that the data is only stored on some nodes some of the time.  Also everything is encrypted by default.  Blockvault stores all of the data on all nodes at all times.  On blockvault your data is however you give it to us, encrypted or unencrypted.  Wouldn't it be terrible if you discover the repository of all human knowledge 1000 years from now but it was all encrypted?  Blockvault aims to be the open data leader, the true sucessor to the library of alexandria - this time one that cannot burn down.%0a!!!!Arweave%0aAnother coin worth mentioning is arweave [[https://www.arweave.org/technology#endowment|#]].  Like Blockvault they claim to want to be like a digital library of alexandria.  This is good and is the only protocol I can find that prioritizes long term data storage.  Its miners are incentivized to replicate data, unlike any other storage cryptocurrency I have seen which typically only have any given piece of data saved on only one node.  However there are some serious design flaws with arweave.  %0a%0aFirst they claim the data will be hosted forever with a small one-time fee just like blockvault, however in arweave (unlike blockvault) this is predicated on the value of the crypto that was paid as the fee to increase over time.  There is no way to ensure this, as nodes and miners can pick and choose which blocks to store depending on the current value of that original transaction fee investment and whether they like your data or not.  In blockvault all nodes and miners have to store all information always period.  %0a%0aSecondly arweave uses "http://".  Using http means arweave has two options, either use icann hosted domains like .com or .org which icann can revoke at any time for supposed infringements, or use decentralized domains like .bit, .eth, .crypto which are not recognized by browsers natively.  What blockvault does in this regard is rely on block explorer browser websites on the legacy internet (that use "[[#bvid|bvid:]]") where people can browse the data there, or more preferably block explorer browser programs that allow users to browse the blockchain on their own computer if they are running a full node, or connect to someone elses full node. At blockvault we are aiming for a new internet, not to dovetail into the legacy one and inherit it's problems.  %0a%0aThirdly arweave content is moderated by nodes using all sorts of checks.  Moderation is censorship.  In blockvault no one can censor the blockchain period.  Also like [[#ipfs|IPFS]], arweave hashes the data, not allowing the information to ever be edited once stored.  To edit you would need to reupload all the information and pay a new storage fee, which isn't efficient.  In blockvault, if you can sign for the page address ([[#bvid|bvid]]) you can edit it, with the original and each subsequent edit preserved forever like [[#github|github]].  There are also no storage fees on blockvault (just tiny transaction fees, that are [[#indiv|optional by the way]]), as the miners are primarily incentivized to always store everyones information to win or verify blocks, unlike any other storage crypto. %0a!!!!IPFS [[#ipfs]]%0aIPFS [[https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/how-ipfs-works/|#]] is similar to [[#safenetwork|safenetwork]] in that some of the nodes host the data some of the time, and sometimes no one is hosting it besides the person who uploaded it.  This leads to the valid fear that people's NFT's hosted on IPFS would someday poof into a 404 error [[https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22349242/nft-metadata-explained-art-crypto-urls-links-ipfs|#]]. In addition to that downside, IPFS hashes the content instead of providing a permanent location which means the content can never be edited.  Since blockvault always stores the info on every node, it is stored according to its location in the blockchain ([[#bvid|BVid]]) not by its content.  In blockvault, the owner of the information can always change it, but the original and any changes will always be accessible like [[#github|github]].  On blockvault NFT's would be able to change over time with each owner, with the original always preserved. Sort of like real life artifacts, the artifact leaves each owner a little different than the last.  Unlike physical artifacts, with blockvault you can go back in time and experience the NFT exactly as it was when it was first made as well, or at any point in time since.%0a!!!!Github [[#github]]%0aWhat's great about github is it allows for content editing by the content owner yet saves a snapshot of the work at every stage which can be browsed by anyone at any time.  For example the bitcoin source code is hosted on github, and right now you can see the original version satoshi nakamoto uploaded as well as every other version.  Blockvault will also store information this way, allowing the content creator and any one they authorize to edit, but also save snapshots at every point in time.%0a%0aGithub is obviously a competitor too but it is similar to archival sites like wayback machine. It is centralized and no one knows how long it will be up, like geocities, how much of your personal info they save on each account holder, and whether or not your account will get banned or your files deleted.%0a%0aAs you can see there is much activity in the decentralized data storage space.  But I believe blockvault is the best and only sustainable solution for the preservation of our civilization.%0a!!!Comparison with Wikipedia%0a%0a!!!!Similarities%0a%0aLike blockvault, wikipedia is open source and everyone can download the entire wikipedia.  However it is unclear how many actually have, as there is little incentive to do so.  Also wikipedia was not designed to be the most compact way to store information possible, with already over hundreds of terabytes of text and multimedia.%0a%0aLike blockvault wikipedia is open to all to add pages and edit pages, with the difference bieng with blockvault the originator of an article controls who can edit it.%0a!!!!Differences%0a%0aUnlike wikipedia we do not believe that there can only be one page per topic that people have to fight over editing.  There can be as many pages about Alicia Keys as people want to create and the [[#seo|best ones would get the most traffic]].  We also believe the original author should have control of editing the page. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub|Stubs]] for topic squatting are not incentivized on blockvault because you cannot "claim" a topic, anyone can create a competing page to yours.%0a%0aUnlike wikipedia it costs "money" to add or edit pages.  You are incentivized to make edits in an editor first and collect them so you can make as many edits as possible at once so you aren't paying too many transaction fees.%0a%0aUnlike wikipedia, blockvault is anonymous and no logins or ip addresses are required or saved.%0a%0aOh and since blockvault contains it's own financial hosting incentives, you will never see a "please donate!" ad again.%0a%0a!!!!!Censorship%0aUnlike wikipedia, which is possibly the most heavily censored site on the internet (of the literallly dozens of well referenced edits I have made there, *all* have been deleted), blockvault is uncensored.  We ask that you do not post copyrighted content and that everything you publish to blockvault you place in the public domain.  The blockchain cannot be deleted, so if something you wrote ends up on blockvault without your permission you can petition the block explorers to not show it on their sites but you cannot censor the blockchain, it is impossible.%0a%0a!!!Comparison to normal web hosting%0a%0aMoving on from wikipedia, one may want to have control over their own work and create their own website so they can't be censored (there are still ways it can be censored by ICANN and even the hosting provider, unlike blockvault).%0a%0aIn blockvault for a small predictable one time fee you can get your work hosted forever.  With standard web hosting you have to pay a monthly fee to keep your work hosted.  When the author can no longer afford the hosting or they lapse in payment due to any numerous reasons, the work is deleted.  In this way typical web hosting is unsustainable whereas blockvault was designed to be sustainable.%0a%0aIf you instead were to decide to self host and host your website from your own computer you still face issues that blockvault doesn't have.  First you have to keep the website hosted yourself, the computer must be running 24/7 and you have to store all the information yourself and backup the data.  If your backups ever fail you loose everything.  You are still subject to domain level censorship via icann and search engine censorship [[https://reclaimthenet.org/google-is-the-search-engine-that-censors-the-most-conspiracy-theories/|#]] via sites like google and bing.  Secondly almost any site will be censored at the ISP level unless you pay around $100 a month for business internet (residential internet blocks the web hosting port 80). Blockvault has none of these issues.  The worst that can happen with blockvault is that your content is censored by a certain blockvault explorer, and there will be many explorers to choose from that are similar, and those that don't censor will be most popular.  In addition to that the actual information on the blockchain will always be there and not censored, no matter what the explorers do.%0a%0a!!!Search engines vs block explorers%0a%0aIn the traditional internet, each search engine needs to crawl and index the web.  This process is massive and for google likely costs billions of dollars a year to perform.  What this does is make it inevitable that one or two search engines would "win" and be able to provide a service no one else can.%0a%0aBlockvault doesn't need a search engine since all the data is instantly accessible by anyone at any time.  Thus block explorers would be used to search instead of search engines, and the overhead to compete by making your own block explorer will be minimal.  If you get censored on Google you are at a huge loss.  If you get censored on a block explorer for blockvault, it is no big deal.%0a%0a!!Pages and Blockvault ID (BVid) [[#bvid]]%0a%0aIn blockvault, all of the data is stored in pages.  Each page has a unique identifier which is called the Blockvault ID (BVid) much like a .onion address.  And it is an address and can be accessed just like an onion address in a block explorer browser. If a BVid is ever traded (changed) then the old address will redirect to the new one.  Each page identifier is a public key created by hashing a private key. You can generate many private keys to try to get a public key (page identifier) that starts with a human readable name if desired.%0a%0aFor example say I wanted to create the page "Alicia Keys".  A random page name might look something like: %0a ucnkdhxbwjwozuwbwmkdochrgf%0a%0aSo I would keep making new private keys so I eventually get something like: %0a aliciakeysdjxneudijrndhshw%0a%0aBut that shouldn't be too necessary because you can assign a human readable title to the page as well.%0a%0aSo the unique blockvault ID (BVid) can be something like: %0a aliciakeysnducgejaiwgfbrjsj%0a%0aAnd the title can be: %0a Alicia Keys%0a%0aBut there might be 1000 "Alicia Keys" articles so a unique BVid is necessary.%0a%0aIn order to edit the page you have to sign for the private key that corresponds to the BVid.  Also owners of the page can authorize the owners of other public keys to edit a page as well. Authorizing another public key to edit a page would be as simple as listing the public key in the article.%0a%0a!!!BVid generation%0a%0a# Create a RSA-2048 keypair using something like puttygen [[https://www.puttykey.com|#]].  This gives you one private key and one public key.%0a%0a# Save the private key and never tell it to anyone period. (If you want someone else to be able to edit your page you can add them as an [[#authorized|authorized key]] so you never have to divulge your own key)%0a%0a# Convert this full public key to [[https://cryptii.com/pipes/base32|base32]] (so it is human readable). This is the [[#bvid|BVid]].%0a%0a# Repeat these steps until you arrive at an address you like.%0a%0a* Important: if RSA 2048 ever becomes unsafe, move to a new standard for address generation and strongly encourage all current BVid holders to send their page to a new upgraded BVid.%0a%0a* There should also probably be checksum digit(s) in the BVid or added at the end or some other form of error correction to guarantee the key is correct. Onion addresses seem to do this now [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.onion#Format|#]]%0a%0a!!BVidD as a UTXO [[#bvidd]]%0a%0aA UTXO in bitcoin is an "unspent transaction output".  It basically is a separate database of all unspent coins from the blockchain.  The information from the blockchain is basically summarized as the UTXO.  It is maintained separately from the blockchain, but one reading the blockchain from scratch could recreate the UTXO themselves thus verifying it is accurate.%0a%0aIn a similar way local nodes would maintain a BVidD.  A BVidD is a BVid database separate from the blockchain that miners might need to have (and certainly would be useful for block explorers) that records all the current content of each BVid (page) and also maintains a history that can be browsed at any given time point, much like how github maintains how the repository was at any given point in time [[https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-Objects|#]]%0a%0aBVidD would also organize "[[#reply|reply]]" pages to connect them to the main page.%0a%0aThis BVidD would basically be the blockchain in a database format that can be used by block explorers.%0a%0a!!Page format [[#format]]%0a%0aA "page" can be a wiki article or a social media post or an encrypted message to a friend etc.  This format below is used for the initial transaction of creating a page and also parts of it can be modified by a later editing transaction.%0a%0a!!!BVid (Blockvault ID)%0a%0aRequired: [[#bvid|BVid]] is the "master public key" for a page and can never be removed from a page.  The author must maintain knowledge of the private key in order to edit the page and add/remove [[#authorized|authorized keys]].  The BVid can be changed only by a signature from the original BVid.  Thus pages can be "traded" from one person to another (thus it can be seen as a sort of "non-fungible token"). However if the master key is lost than authorized keys can continue to edit the page.%0a!!!Authorized keys [[#authorized]]%0a%0aOptional: An authorized key is one that the creator of the page allows to also edit the page.  Authorized keys can be deleted from the page only by the holder of the (current) BVid for the page.  The way it works is if an authorized key is added to the [[#format|page format]], then if someone submits an edit with a signature of the authorized key, that edit is accepted by the network.%0a!!!Proof of work%0a%0aOptional: you can create [[#indiv|your own proof of work]] using a PC, laptop, or smart device and skip paying the transaction fee for posting content if you want.  The difficulty per kilobyte will be determined by the network and it should be comparable to just buying blockvault tokens to pay the fee.  Convenience of using blockvault tokens will cost a bit more money, as it should.%0a%0a!!!Title%0aOptional: This section can have a maximum of 30 base 26 characters (letters without capitals)%0a%0a!!!Keywords%0a%0aOptional: This section can have a maximum of 30 base 26 characters (letters without uppercase)%0a!!!Summary%0a%0aOptional: This section can have up to 300 base 36 characters (letters with no capitals and numbers)%0a!!!Reply to [[#reply]]%0aOptional: This is meant to be used to "reply" or "comment on" another post/page.%0a!!!Content%0a%0aRequired: The content section is the only place that uses optional [[#markup|markup]] language.%0a%0a%0a%0a!!Markup language%0a%0aMarkup language is optional and can be dictated by block explorer app's.  For example a messenger app might ask for a different markup language than a social media app or a wiki app for example.%0a%0aFor ease of use we can use something similar to PmWiki's markup language [[https://www.pmwiki.org/wiki/PmWiki/MarkupMasterIndex|#]] for most website/wiki pages.  Also to link to other blockvault pages on your page, you can make an internal link that looks like [@ [[aliciakeysdjchenwjdocnej]] @] and it will link to that certain page. You can absolutely link to legacy internet addresses, but eventually I believe internal blockvault addresses would predominate.%0a%0a!!!Decoding%0a%0a"Block explorers" for block vault would use the markup language in the blockchain and reconstruct good looking website using the data from blockvault.  They could even allow you to create content to their site and compile your recent edits into transactions on the blockchain to get everyone to incorporate them.%0a%0a!!Blockchain technicals%0a%0a!!!Coins [[#seo]]%0a%0aCoins would be generated just like every blockchain and given to the winner of the block.%0a%0aEach BVid is an address that coins can be sent to.  That is a way for creators to make money from their content, people will donate directly to the BVid.  Perhaps a "like" of the page could cost a coin, similar to "steemit".  These (unspent) likes can be used as block explorer "seo". Also page creators could charge you a fee (sent to the page BVid) if you want to edit the page (add the senders public key as an [[#authorized|authorized key]]).%0a%0a!!!!Units%0a%0aUnits will be to 4 decimal places, about the maximum the human mind can easily comprehend.%0a%0a!!!!Transaction fee [[#tfee]]%0a%0aThe fee will always be the smallest unit, 0.0001 coins per kilobyte (a kilobyte is about half of a page of text).  Miners are primarily incentivized by the [[#reward|block reward]] so this transaction fee is mainly for spam prevention.  However this fee is [[#indiv|optional]] if you provide your own proof of CPU work which will also function to limit spam.%0a%0a!!!Mining [[#mining]]%0aWhether or not we are miners or just running a node to support the network, mining needs to ensure that the miner is storing the entire blockchain (or at least a *lossless* compressed version of the blockchain).  The reason mining needs to ensure the miner is storing the entire blockchain is that the miner is the only person who can be directly incentivized by the protocol to store it.%0a%0aProof of Bible Hash (POBH) by BiblePay blockchain was also designed to do this task, in their case proving that you are storing the Blockchain and the bible [[https://www.biblepay.org/mining/#POBH|#]]. Unfortunatly the way it is done is open to vulnerabilities like connecting to a remote node or storing only parts of the blockchain since only a few calls to the blockchain are made.%0a%0aThe only real way to ensure that mining is only done on full nodes (those storing a full blockchain) is to require the entire blockchain to be included in every hash.  Since you are mining a new block that is not yet in the blockchain, for the miner the "full blockchain" would include all past blocks and the new block that you are proposing belongs in the blockchain.  %0a%0a//**So mining would look something like taking the RandomX hash of the entire (probably compressed) blockchain**//%0a%0a%0a'+We can call this something like Proof of Full Node Work or "Profun work"+' [[#profun]]%0a%0aThe benefits to this is it will make asics and gpu's even more impossible to use because not only do you have the gpu/asic resistance of randomx but also the requirement to store the entire blockchain in very fast local memory which would make asic production prohibitively expensive.%0a%0aThe downsides to this is the hashing process would be slower (but slower can be good because it reduces power consumption) so the randomx parameters can be set so as to offset this.  As long as commodity hardware can get multiple hashes per second it should be sufficient.%0a%0aI'm sure the compression mechanism would need to be changed over time and definitely the randomx parameters will need to be increased over time to keep gpu and asic resistance over the decades.%0a%0a!!!!Question: won't the blockchain at some point be too big to hash?%0a%0aNo, taking the cryptographic hash of a large dataset will take longer than a short one, but only proportionately so [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7060091/how-long-does-sha-1-take-to-create-hashes|#]].  This means that there will never be an upper limit to how big the blockchain can get and still take the hash.  As the blockchain grows, so will computing power.  Right now a standard computer can compute the hash of multiple gigabytes per second.%0a%0aStandard hashing like this has to be done on one core and is not parrallelizable [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2717216/what-hash-algorithms-are-parallelizable-optimizing-the-hashing-of-large-files-u|#]].  The good part of this is that every 7 seconds, the optimized asic design would be obsoleted making this method basically asic proof since the hash data size increases every block.%0a%0a!!!!!Then why not just always divide the blockchain into 4 equal chunks so it can be done by a 4 core processor faster?%0a%0aThe reason is because we would only get a linear speedup which is basically negligible in the grand scheme of things.  Also we would then need to keep increasing the number of chunks based on arbitrary judgements of when 8 core becomes standard etc.%0a%0aYou can still do 4 hashes at once with a 4 core processor, they just have to be separate hashes.%0a%0a!!!!!Since this method is basically asic-proof, why not use the fastest algorithm possible like sha-1 instead of randomx?%0a%0aThe reason is so it is even more asic proof.  One could imagine if something simple like sha-1 is used an asic manufacturer could make 1 core chips that are 10ghz and a few tb medium speed common memory shared by all the chips. While this is not a very practical or profitable or competitive asic design, it could be done.  Adding in the complexity of randomx which throws extra loops in asic design, just seals the deal that asic manufacturers won't even waste the time to try.%0a!!!!Mining process%0a%0a#Use the mempool of new transactions and create a new block.%0a%0a#Add your block to the current blockchain as if it is now a part of it.%0a%0a#Compress this proposed version of the blockhchain.%0a%0a#Take the RandomX hash of this.  This is the hash.%0a%0a*Compression needs to be lossless and fully and easily reversible.  A cryptographic hash is not compression.%0a%0a!!!!Verifying a proposed block%0a%0aIf you are running a full node this is the process you will use to verify that the winning block you recieve from a miner is valid%0a%0a#Verify that the proposed block is of correct format and valid%0a%0a#Append the proposed block to the blockchain you are storing in your memory%0a%0a#Compress this entire proposed blockchain%0a%0a#Hash this compressed blockchain using RandomX%0a%0a#Verify that this hash is the same as that proposed by the winning miner.%0a%0a*This verified that the winning miner was holding the full and correct blockchain and followed all the rules.  Also it makes sure each verifying node is also a full node.%0a%0a%0a%0a!!!Emission [[#reward]]%0a%0aEmission will initially be 1000 coins per block, and each block is 7 seconds.  So the emission per year will be a little less than dogecoin.%0a%0aHowever this 1000 coins per block will go up by 1%25 every year.  The US prints an average of 7%25 a year [[https://bitflate.org/post/2021/05/21/inflation-and-security.html|#]]  which leads to about a 2%25 inflation in prices (nowadays in 2021 the fed is printing much much more than that however). So a 1%25 increase a year should lead to no appreciable difference in prices over time, thus this design is non-inflationary. This is opposed to the deflationary and thus volatile (and unsustainable) nature of other cryptocurrencies.  %0a%0aThe reason the block reward increases by 1%25 a year is if we don't do this then it will be harder and harder to get coins by mining every year.  The whole point of blockvault is that it is around and alive for many centuries to come, so we must consider what mining will be like that far into the future.  No one can be sure if transaction fees alone can incentivize miners sufficiently that far into the future. Also the more coins we can get into peoples hands while keeping prices constant, the more economic activity can happen and thus more work gets done in society and the world becomes a better place.%0a%0aYear 1 reward: 1000 coins%0a%0aYear 2: 1010 coins%0a%0aYear 3: 1020.1 coins%0a%0aYear 4: 1030.301 coins%0a%0aEtc.%0a%0a!!!Blocksize%0a%0aThere is no upper blocksize limit, similar to the original bitcoin design.  What will limit blocksize is how big of a block will you risk sending that will bring your proof of work to the majority of nodes before someone else gets their block to the majority of nodes first.  Smaller blocks travel faster so there would be a sweetspot blocksize for collecting the most fees and not letting your block get orphaned. As time progresses and the network can transmit data faster, the sweetspot blocksize will increase.%0a%0aThat said, nodes can set their own rules for how big of a block they are willing to verify.  One attack could be that an attacker could send a bunch of huge invalid blocks, wasting nodes verification time.  Firstly nodes would block ip addresses of nodes relaying bad blocks.  Secondly a node can say something like "I am not going to try to verify any block bigger than 10x the size of the average blocksize over the last month".  However if another node does accept larger blocks, and one of them does make it into the blockchain, then all nodes will need to verify it - but in that case at least lighter nodes only verify huge blocks that heavier nodes already verified.%0a%0a!!!Blocktime%0aBlocktime will be set to 7 seconds, near the limit of the speed of light to traverse the network and still allow for 90%25 of the blocktime for the process of mining. Like all blockchains we want updates to happen fast.  Even if we break the speed of light barrier by using [[NatureVault.MagneticUnity|Magnetic Unity]] principles by rarifying the [[NatureVault.Aether|Aether]], then it would only add to our decentralized nature.%0a!!Individualized proof of work (iPoW)[[#indiv]]%0a%0a[[#mining|Mining]] has a [[#profun|separate proof of work]]; but this is an alternative to paying a [[#tfee|transaction fee]].%0a%0aThe primary way that miners are incentivized to hold the blockchain and provide proof of work ([[#profun|profun]] work) is the [[#reward|block reward]] which ever so slightly increases with time to make sure they stay incentivized forever.  Miners also earn the small [[#tfee|transaction fees]].  Unless there are 10 million transactions every 7 seconds on the network, the fees collected would be (much) smaller than the block reward.  %0a%0aSo the only real reason we need to collect fees for transactions is to prevent spam transactions, people maliciously trying to slow down the network.%0a%0aWell as an optional alternative to transaction fees (transaction fees are still accepted and are convenient and cheap), we can achieve spam prevention by allowing people to provide thier own proof of work to make spamming impractical.%0a%0aFactoring a large number (over around 120 digits) is very challenging thing to do even with the technology we have today.  In fact it is the proof of work in the [[CollectBit]] project.  It is so hard that despite decades of research, GPU's and ASIC's have never been created that can do it, and no inventions have even been able to come up with a way it could be done practically.  CPU's, the things in your desktop computer, smartphone, or servers can do it however.  So what this means is that you can use your desktop to provide this proof of work and bypass paying a fee to [[#format|post/transact]] on blockvault.%0a%0a!!!Here is how it would work:%0a%0a#The network agrees on a difficulty per kilobyte.  For example a 1 kb transaction could require factoring a 145 digit number.  Each additional kb in the transaction could increase the digit requirement by 1.  So for a 10kb transaction it would require factoring a 155 digit number. So this individualized proof of work would only be practical for a transaction smaller than a few kb.  If you need to add more data to the blockchain just do it in several transactions.%0a%0a#You hash your proposed transaction and a random 6 digit nonce using [[https://codebeautify.org/shake-256-hash-generator|shake256-1024]].  %0a%0a#Then you [[https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/hex-to-decimal.html|convert to base-10 (numbers)]].%0a%0a#Truncate this number to the first 145 digits (or whatever the length needs to be).%0a%0a#Factor this number (see [[NatureVault.DigitalCollectibleNetwork#miner|DCN mining]] for more info).%0a%0a#Make sure the factorization meets the network requirements, if not go back to step 2 and pick a different nonce until it does.%0a%0aThe network requirements not only specifies the digit length of the number to factor, but also the requirements of the prime factors themselves.  In [[CollectBit]], we determined that the prime factorization must be only 2 prime factors, the smaller of the two must be at least 36%25 of the digit requirement.  We should use this requirement here too, 36%25 was chosen because a GPU can ECM to 34%25, and we don't want GPU's hunting for easy to factor numbers and not have to use CPU's.%0a%0aFor example if we are factoring a 145 digit number then the prime factorization must be exactly 2 factors and the length of the smallest factor must be greater than or equal to 0.36*145 so 52.2 rounded up to 53 digits.  This makes sure that the factorization you perform as the proof of work really took you some time to complete.%0a%0aEvery year the network should revisit the requirement and make sure that it takes roughly a given timeframe on a decent desktop per kilobyte, say 8 hours for 1kb (so you could run it while you sleep).%0a%0a!!!!Question: won't this mean that no one will use coins to pay transaction fees?%0a%0aNo, this process is designed to take time and so just paying the very small transaction fee will probably almost universally be done, especially for financial transactions which people need done quickly.%0a!!"The Block" [[#block]]%0a%0aInspired by the "tungsten cube" craze and the black monolith in 2001: A Space Odyssey, "the block" is a cube (perhaps obsidian or a semiconductor like cadmium telluride) roughly 4" that somehow contains all the data from the blockvault hard coded (etched) into it.  It is a snapshot of the blockvault at a certain point in time.  This would be a way to store all the data on blockvault totally and permanently immune to the environment and solar flares and emp's.  Creating these blocks is a way for blockvault node operators to have a physical product to sell.%0a%0aOne corner of the block is missing and there is a small maybe 2 mm cube inserted there that tells in microscopic yet human readable format the date, what the block contains, and how to read it.%0a%0aFor now until the tech is invented we can have an "imitation block" which is just a sealed EMP proof enclosure that houses a flash drive or something :). But you have to break it open to access it.%0a%0a"What's that?" %3cPoints to black cube you are holding> "Oh that, that's the internet"%0a%0a!!Notes%0a%0aGenerating a .onion address [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48838082/replicating-onion-address-algorithm|#]] new method [[https://tor.stackexchange.com/questions/20570/bitcoin-types-of-onion-address|#]]%0a%0aECDSA vs RSA [[https://www.ssl.com/article/comparing-ecdsa-vs-rsa/|#]]%0a%0aInventor of the internet is sorry for the slashes [[https://www.sitepoint.com/sir-tim-berners-lee-http-slashes/|#]] and other tech regrets [[https://www.businessinsider.com/eight-regrettable-tech-inventions-regretted-2009-10|#]]%0a%0aThe real history of AIM [[https://mashable.com/archive/aim-history|#]]%0a%0aECM on asic fpga [[https://people-ece.vse.gmu.edu/~kgaj/publications/conferences/GMU_SHARCS_2006_slides.pdf|#]] and gpu [[https://eecm.cr.yp.to/gpuecm-20090127.pdf|#]]%0a%0aFeatures I like: no mining pools by wownero, block subsidy based on time to solve the block decreasing subsidy for a hash attack from biblepay, quick difficulty adjustment like darkgravity wave, slight inflation like bitflate, randomx like monero, wownero, biblepay, needing to hash stored data in every hash like biblepay.%0a%0a\\%0a\\%0a\\%0a%0a%0a%0a//...

There is no way to ensure this, as nodes and miners can pick and choose which blocks to store depending on the current value of that original transaction fee investment and whether they like your data or not.  In blockvault all nodes and miners have to store all information always period.  Secondly arweave uses "http://".  Using http means arweave has two options, either use icann hosted domains like .com or .org which icann can revoke at any time for supposed infringements, or use decentralized domains like .bit, .eth, .crypto which are not recognized by browsers natively.  What blockvault does in this regard is rely on block explorer browser websites on the legacy internet (that use "[[#bvid|bvid:]]") where people can browse the data there, or more preferably block explorer browser programs that allow users to browse the blockchain on their own computer if they are running a full node, or connect to someone elses full node. At blockvault we are aiming for a new internet, not to dovetail into the legacy one and inherit it's problems.  Thirdly arweave content is moderated by nodes using all sorts of checks.  Moderation is censorship.  In blockvault no one can censor the blockchain period.  Also like IPFS, arweave hashes the data, not allowing the information to ever be edited once stored.  To edit you would need to reupload all the information and pay a new storage fee, which isn't efficient.  In blockvault, if you can sign for the page address ([[#bvid|bvid]]) you can edit it, with the original and each subsequent edit preserved forever.  There are also no storage fees on blockvault (just tiny transaction fees, that are [[#indiv|optional by the way]]), as the miners are primarily incentivized to store everyones information to win blocks, unlike any other storage crypto. %0a---%0a> Another coin worth mentioning is arweave [[https://www.arweave.org/technology#endowment|#]].
