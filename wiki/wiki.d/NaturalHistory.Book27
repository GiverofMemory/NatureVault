text=BOOK XXVII. %0a%0aA DESCRIPTION OF PLANTS, AND OF THE REMEDIES DE¬ %0aRIVED FROM THEM. %0a%0aCHAP. 1. (1.)—BESEABCHES OF THE ANCIENTS UPON THIS %0aSUBJECT. %0a%0aThe farther I proceed in this work, the more I am impressed %0awith admiration of the ancients ; and the greater the number %0aof plants that remain to be described, the more I am induced %0ato venerate the zeal displayed by the men of former times in %0atheir researches, and the kindly spirit manifested by them in %0atransmitting to us the results thereof. Indeed their bounteous¬ %0aness in this respect would almost seem to have surpassed the %0amunificent disposition even of Nature herself, if our knowledge %0aof plants had depended solely upon man’s spirit of discovery : %0abut as it is, it is evident beyond all doubt that this knowledge %0ahas emanated from the gods themselves, or, at all events, has %0abeen the result of divine inspiration, even in those cases where %0aman has been instrumental in communicating it to us. In %0aother words, if we must confess the truth—a marvel surpassed %0aby nothing in our daily experience—Nature herself, that %0acommon parent of all things, has at once produced them, and %0ahas discovered to us their properties. %0a%0aWondrous indeed is it, that a Scythian 1 plant should he %0abrought from the shores of the Palus Maeotis, and the euphor¬ %0abia 2 from Mount Atlas and the regions beyond the Pillars of %0aHercules, localities where the operations of Nature have reached %0atheir utmost limit ! That in another direction, the plant %0abritannica 2 * should he conveyed to us from isles of the %0aOcean situate beyond the confines of the earth ! 3 That the %0affithiopis 1 should reach us from a climate scorched by the %0a%0a1 He alludes to the Glycyrrhiza or Scythice, our Liquorice, which is %0astill found on the hanks of the river Volga. See B. xxi. c. 54, B. xxii. %0ac. 11, B. xxv. c. 43, and B. xxvi. cc. 15, 87. %0a%0a2 See B. xxv. c. 38. 2 * See B. xxv. c. 6. %0a%0a3 “ Extra terras.” Meaning, the continental part of the earth. %0a%0a* See o. 3 of this Book. %0a%0a%0a218 %0a%0a%0aPLINY’S NATUUAL HISTOBY. %0a%0a%0a[Book XXVII. %0a%0a%0aluminaries of heaven! And then, in addition to all this, that %0athere should be a perpetual interchange going on between all %0aparts of the earth, of productions so instrumental to the welfare %0aof mankind ! Results, all of them, ensured to us by the peace %0athat reigns under the majestic sway of the Roman power, a %0apeace which brings in presence of each other, not individuals %0aonly, belonging to lands and nations far separate, hut moun¬ %0atains even, and heights towering above the clouds, their plants %0aand their various productions ! That this great bounteousness %0aof the gods may know no end, is my prayer, a bounteousness %0awhich seems to have granted the Roman sway as a second %0aluminary for the benefit of mankind. %0a%0aCHAP. 2. (2.)—ACONITE, OTHEBW18E CALLED THELYPHONON, CAM- %0aMABON, PABD ALI AN CUES, OB SCOBPIO ; FOUB BEMEDIES. %0a%0aBut who, I say, can sufficiently venerate the zeal and spirit of %0aresearch displayed by the ancients ? It is they who have shown %0aus that aconite is the most prompt of all poisons in its effects %0a—so much so indeed, that female animals, if the sexual parts* %0aare but touched with it, will not survive a single day. With %0athis poison it was that M. Caecilius 6 accused Calpurnius Bestia %0aof killing his wives in their sleep, and this it was that gave %0arise to that fearful peroration of his, denouncing the murderous %0afinger of the accused. 7 According to the fables of mythology, %0athis plant was originally produced from the foam of the dog %0aCerberus, when dragged by Hercules from the Infernal 8 Re¬ %0agions ; for which reason, it is said, it is still so remarkably %0aabundant in the vicinity of Heraclea in Pontus, a spot where %0athe entrance is still pointed out to the shades below. %0a%0aAnd yet, noxious as it is, the ancients have shown us how to %0aemploy aconite for the benefit of mankind, and have taught us %0aas the result of their experience, that, taken in mulled wine, %0ait neutralizes the venom of the scorpion : indeed such is the %0anature of this deadly plant, that it kills man, unless it can find %0a%0a5 See B. xxv. c. 75. %0a%0a6 Properly “ Caelius ”—the same M. Caelius Rufus who is mentioned %0ain B. vii. c. 50. See also B. xxxv. c. 46. %0a%0a7 “ Hinc ilia atrox peroratio ejus in digitum.” Sillig is probably right %0a%0ain his suggestion that the word “ mortiferum ” is wanting at the end of %0athe sentence. Bestia was accused of having killed his wives by the %0acontact of aconite, applied, through the agency of the finger, to the secret %0aparts. 8 See B. vi. c. i. %0a%0a%0aChap. 2.] %0a%0a%0aACONITE. %0a%0a%0a219 %0a%0a%0ain man something else to kill. When such is the case, as %0athough it had discovered in the body a fit rival to contend with, %0athat substance is the sole object of its attack ; finding another %0apoison in the viscera, to it alone it confines its onslaught; %0aand thus, a truly marvellous thing ! two poisons, each of them %0aof a deadly nature, destroy one another within the body, and %0athe man survives. Even more than this, the ancients have %0ahanded down to us remedies employed by the animals them¬ %0aselves, and have shown how that venomous creatures even effect %0atheir own cure. By the contact of aconite the scorpion is %0astruck with torpor, 9 is quite benumbed, assumes a pallid hue, %0aand so confesses itself vanquished. When this is the case, %0awhite hellebore is its great auxiliary: the very touch of it dis- %0apels its torpor, and the aconite is forced to yield before two %0afoes, its own enemy 10 and the common 11 enemy of all. %0a%0aNow, after this, if any one should be of opinion that man %0acould, by any chance or possibility, make such discoveries as %0athese, he must surely be guilty of ingratitude in thus appre¬ %0aciating the beneficence of the gods! In countries frequented %0aby the panther, they rub meat with aconite, and if one of %0athose animals should but taste it, its effects are fatal: indeed %0awere not these means adopted, the country would soon be over¬ %0arun by them. It is for this reason, too, that some persons %0ahave given to hellebore the name of “ pardalianches.” 12 It has %0abeen well ascertained, however, that the panther instantaneously %0arecovers if it can find the opportunity of eating human ordure. 13 %0aSo far as these animals are concerned, who can entertain a %0adoubt that it was chance only that first led them to this dis¬ %0acovery ; and that as often as this happens the discovery is only %0aa mere repetition of the accident, there being neither reason %0anor an appreciation of experience to ensure its transmission %0aamong them ? %0a%0a(3.) It is chance, 14 yes, it is chance that is the Deity who %0ahas made to us these numerous revelations for our practical %0a%0a* See B. xxv. c. 75. %0a%0a10 The hellebore.

He would appear not to have %0aknown exactly wbat bis belief was in reference to first causes. %0a%0a%0a220 %0a%0a%0apltni’s natural history. [Book XXVII. %0a%0a%0abenefit ; 15 always understanding that under this name we mean %0aNature, that great parent and mistress of all things : and this %0ais evident, whether we come to the conclusion, that these wild %0abeasts make the discovery from day to day, or that they are %0agifted from the first with these powers of perception. Re. %0agarded in another point of view, it really is a disgrace that %0aall animated beings should have an exact knowledge of what %0ais beneficial to them, with the exception of man ! %0a%0aThe ancients, openly professing their belief that there is no %0aevil without some admixture of good, have asserted that aconite %0ais a remarkably useful ingredient in compositions for the eyes. %0aIt may therefore be permitted me, though I have hitherto %0aomitted a description of the poisonous plants, to point out the %0acharacteristics of aconite, if only that it may be the more %0aeasily detected. Aconite 16 has leaves like those of cyclaminos 1 ’ %0aor of the cucumber, never more than four in number, slightly %0ahairy, and rising from near the root. This root, which is of %0amoderate size, resembles the sea-fish known as the “cam- %0amarus,” 18 a circumstance owing to which the plant has received %0athe name of “ cammaron ” from some; while others, for the %0areason already 19 mentioned, have called it “ thelyphonon.’’ M %0aThe root is slightly curved, like a scorpion’s tail, for which %0areason some persons have given it the name of “scorpio.” %0aOthers, again, have preferred giving it the name of “ myoc- %0atonon,” 21 from the fact that the odour of it kills mice at a %0aconsiderable distance even. %0a%0aThis plant is found growing upon the naked rocks known %0aas “ aconae ;” 22 and hence it is, according to some authorities, %0a%0a15 “ Hoc habet nomen ” is omitted ; for, as Sillig says, it is evidently a %0agloss, which has crept into the text. %0a%0a16 The ancients no doubt knew several plants under the common name %0aof Aconitum. The one here described, is identified by Fee with the Do- %0aronicum pardalianches of Linnaeus, Leopard’s bane. %0a%0a11 See B. xxv. c. 67. Fee says that neither the leaves of the Doronicum, %0anor of any plant of the genus Arnica, bear any resemblance to those of %0athe Cyclamen, or the cucumber. He remarks also, that the contact solely %0aof it is not productive of poisonous effects. %0a%0a18 A kind of crab. 19 At the beginning of this Chapter. %0a%0a20 “ Female-bane,” or “ female-killer.” See B. xx. c. 23. %0a%0a21 “ Mice-killer.” This assertion is incorrect. %0a%0a22 So called from a, “without,” and koviq, “dust.” Theophrastus %0asays that it received its name from the town of Aeon®, in the vicinity of %0awhich it grew in great abundance. %0a%0a%0aChap. 4.] %0a%0a%0aAGERATON. %0a%0a%0a221 %0a%0a%0athat it is called “ aconitum,” there being not so much as dust %0aeven about it to conduce to its nutriment. Such is the reason %0agiven for its name by some : but according to others, it re¬ %0aceives this appellation from the fact that it fatally exercises the %0asame effects upon the body that the whetstone 23 does upon the %0aedge of iron, being no sooner employed than its effects are felt. %0a%0aCHAP. 3. (4.)- A5TH10PIS I FOUR REMEDIES. %0a%0a.Ethiopis 24 is a plant with leaves resembling those of phlo- %0amos,“ large, numerous, hairy, and springing from the root. %0aThe stem is square, rough, similar to that of arction 35 * in ap¬ %0apearance, and with numerous axillary concavities. The seed %0aresembles that of the fitch, being white and twofold ; the roots %0aare several in number, long, fleshy, soft, and of a viscous taste ; %0awhen dry they turn black and hard, and might easily be taken %0afor horns. In addition to ^Ethiopia, this plant grows upon %0aMount Ida in Troas, and in Messenia. The roots are gathered %0ain autumn, and left to dry for some days in the sun, to prevent %0athem from turning mouldy. Taken in white wine they are %0acurative of affections of the uterus, and a decoction of them %0ais administered for sciatica, pleurisy, and eruptions of the %0athroat. The kind, however, which comes from ^Ethiopia, is %0aby far the best, and gives instantaneous relief. %0a%0aCHAP. 4. -AGERATON : FOUR REMEDIES. %0a%0aAgeraton 26 is a ferulaceous plant, a couple of palms in height, %0asimilar to origanum 27 in appearance, and bearing flowers like %0aballs of gold. Used as a fumigation, this plant acts as a %0adiuretic; and as a detergent upon the uterus, when used in a %0a. sitting bath more particularly. Its name has been given to it, %0afrom the circumstance that it keeps a very long time without %0afading. %0a%0a25 Also called cikovt]. %0a%0a21 Generally identified with the Salvia argentea of Linnaeus, Silver sage, %0aor else with the Salvia JEthiopis, Woolly sage. It must not be confounded %0awith the plant of the same name mentioned in B. xxiv. c. 102. %0a%0a24 See B. xxv. c. 73. %0a%0a:i * See c. 16 of this Book. %0a%0a26 “Not growing old.’’ It is identified by Fee and Desfontaines with %0a%0athe Acbillaea ageratum of Linnaeus, Sweet milfoil or Maudlin. Littre %0agives as its synonym, the Hypericum origanifolium. • %0a%0a27 See B. xx. c. 67. %0a%0a%0a222 %0a%0a%0aflint's nattjb.il histoby. %0a%0a%0a[Book XXVII. %0a%0a%0aCHAP. 5.—THE ALOE ; TWENTY-NINE KEMEDIE8. %0a%0aThe aloe 28 bears a resemblance to the squill, except that it is %0alarger, and has more substantial leaves, with streaks running %0aobliquely. The stem is tender, red in the middle, and not %0aunlike that of the anthericus. 29 It has a single root, which runs %0astraight downwards, like a stake driven into the ground; its %0asmell is powerful, and it has a bitter taste. The most esteemed %0aaloes are those imported from India, but it grows in the Asiatic %0aprovinces 30 as well. This last kind, however, is never used, %0aexcept that the leaves are applied fresh to wounds; indeed, %0athese leaves, as well as the juice, are glutinous to a marvellous %0adegree, and it is for this property that it is grown in vessels of %0aa conical form, in the same way as the greater aizoiim. 31 Some %0apersons make incisions in the stem to obtain the j uice, before %0athe 6eed is ripe, while others, again, make them in the leaves %0aas well. Tearlike drops are also found adhering to it, which %0aexude spontaneously: hence it is that some recommend that %0athe place should be paved where it is grown, to prevent this %0ajuice from being absorbed. %0a%0aSome authors have stated, that there is found in Judaea, %0abeyond Hierosolyma, a mineral 32 aloe, but that it is inferior to %0athe other kinds, being of a darker colour and more humid than %0aany of the rest. Aloes 53 of the finest quality should be %0aunctuous and shining, of a red colour, brittle, compact, like %0athe substance of liver, and easily liquefied. That which is %0ahard and black should be rejected; the same, too, when it is %0amixed with sand or adulterated with gum and acacia, a fraud %0awhich may be easily detected by the taste. %0a%0aThis plant is of an astringent nature, binding, and slightly %0acalorific. It is employed for numerous purposes, but principally %0aas a purgative, 34 it being almost the only one of all the medica- %0a%0a28 The ancients probably included under this name several distinct species %0aof the aloe. They were well acquainted, Fee says, with the Indian aloe, %0abut probably not with that of Africa. As described by Pliny, he identifies %0ait with the Aloe perfoliata of Linnaeus: Desfontaines gives the Aloe %0aumbellata. 29 See B. xxi. c. 68. 30 “ Asia." %0a%0a31 See B. xxv. c. 102. The aloe is still grown in large wooden vessels, %0ain this country, at least; but only as an ornament. %0a%0a32 He alludes to the bitumen of Judaea, much used by the Egyptians for %0athe purposes of embalmment. %0a%0a33 He is speaking of the prepared aloes of commerce. %0a%0a31 It is still used for this purpose. %0a%0a%0aChap. 5.] %0a%0a%0aTHE ALOE. %0a%0a%0a223 %0a%0a%0araents which produce that effect, that is at the same time a %0agood stomachic, and does not exercise the slightest noxious %0ainfluence upon the stomach. It is taken in doses of one %0adrachma, and, in cases of derangement of the stomach, it is %0aadministered two or three times a day, in the proportion of %0aone spoonful to two cyathi of warm or cold water, at intervals, %0aaccording to the nature of the emergency. As a purgative it %0ais mostly taken in doses of three drachmae; and it operates %0astill more efficaciously, if food is eaten directly afterwards. %0aUsed with astringent wine, it prevents 35 the hair from falling %0aoff, the head being rubbed with it the contrary way of the %0ahair, in the sun. Applied to the temples and forehead with %0arose oil and vinegar, or used as an infusion, in a more diluted %0aform, it allays head-ache. It is generally agreed that it is %0aremedial for all diseases 36 of the eyes, but more particularly for %0aprurigo and scaly eruptions of the eye-lids ; as also for marks %0aand bruises, applied in combination with honey, Pontic honey %0ain particular. %0a%0aIt is employed,also, for affections of the tonsillary glands and %0agums, for all ulcerations of the mouth, and for spitting of %0ablood, if not in excess—the proper dose being one drachma, %0ataken in water or else vinegar. Used by itself, or in combination %0awith vinegar, it arrests haemorrhage, whether proceeding from %0awounds or from other causes. In addition to these properties, it %0ais extremely efficacious for the cure of wounds, producing %0acicatrization very rapidly : it is sprinkled also upon ulcerations %0aof the male organs, and is applied to condylomata and chaps %0aoi the fundament, either in common wine, raisin wine, or by %0aitself in a dry state, according as a mollifying or restrictive %0atreatment is required. It has the effect, also, of gently %0aarresting haemorrhoidal bleeding, when in excess. In cases of %0adysentery, it is used as an injection, and where the digestion %0ais imperfect it is taken shortly after the evening meal. For %0ajaundice, it is administered in doses of three oboli, in %0awater. As a purgative for the bowels, it is taken in pills, with %0aboiled honey or turpentine. It is good also for the removal of %0ahangnails. When employed in ophthalmic preparations, it is %0afirst washed, that the more gravelly portions of it may subside; %0a%0aM There is no foundation, Fee says, for this statement. %0a%0aM It would appear that it is still employed in India for this purpose, %0abut it is no longer used in Europe. %0a%0a%0a224 %0a%0a%0aplint’s natural history. %0a%0a%0a[Book XXVII. %0a%0a%0aor else it is put over the fire in a pipkin, and stirred with a %0afeather from time to time, that the w hole of it may be equally %0awarmed. %0a%0a%0aCHAT. 6.—ALCEA : ONE REMEDY. %0a%0aAlcea 37 is a plant with leaves, resembling those of vervain," %0aknown also as “ peristereon,” some three or four stems %0acovered with leaves, a flower like that of the rose, and white %0aroots, at most six in number, a cubit in length, and running %0aobliquely. It grows in a soil that is rich without being dry. %0aThe root is given in wine or water, for dysentery, diarrhoea, %0aruptures, and convulsions. %0a%0aCHAP. 7.-THE ALYPON : ONE REMEDY. %0a%0aThe alypon 39 has a small stem, with a soft head, and is not %0aunlike beet in appearance. It has an acrid, viscous taste, %0aextremely pungent and burning. Taken in hydromel, with %0aa little sailt, it acts as a purgative. The smallest dose is two %0adrachmae, a moderate dose, four, and the largest, six. When %0aused as a purgative, it is taken in chicken broth. %0a%0aCHAP. 8. -ALSINE, A PLANT USED FOR THE SAME PURPOSES AS %0a%0aHELXINE : FIVE REMEDIES. %0a%0aAlsine, 40 a plant known as “myosoton” 41 to some, grows in the %0awoods, to which fact it is indebted for its name of “ alsine.” 42 %0aIt begins to make its appearance at mid-winter, and withers in %0athe middle of summer. When it first puts forth, the leaves %0abear a strong resemblance to the ears of mice. We shall have %0a%0a37 Identified by Fee with the Malva alcea of Linnaeus, the Vervain %0amallow, an emollient and, comparatively, inert plant. Littre gives as %0aits synonym the Malope malacho'ides, Marsh mallow. Sibthorp identifies %0ait with the Hibiscus trionum, and Anguillara with the Althaea canryibina %0aof Linnaeus. It is probably the same plant as the Alcima, mentioned several %0atimes in B. xxvi. 38 See B. xxv. c. 59. %0a%0a39 Identified with the Globularia alypum of Linnaeus, the Three-toothed %0aleaf Globularia, or Turbith. %0a%0a40 Identified by Sprengel with the Cerastium aquaticum, and by other %0a%0aauthorities with the Alsine media of Linnaeus, the Common chickweed. %0aDesfontaines suggests the Stellaria nemorum, the Broadleaved stitchwort, %0abut Fee prefers the Parietaria Cretica of Linnaeus, Cretan pellitory, as its %0asynonym. 41 “ Mouse-ear.” %0a%0a42 From the Greek akooc, a “ grove.” %0a%0a%0aChap. 10.] %0a%0a%0aANDEOSAMON. %0a%0a%0a225 %0a%0a%0aoccasion, 43 however, to speak of another plant, which may, %0awith much more justice, be called “ myosotis.” As for alsine, it %0awould be the same thing as helxine, 44 were it not that it is smaller %0aand not so hairy. It grows in 45 gardens, and upon walls more %0aparticularly : when rubbed, it emits a smell like that of cucum¬ %0aber. It is used for abscesses, inflammations, and all those pur¬ %0aposes for which helxine is employed ; its properties, however, %0aare not so active. It is applied topically, also, to defluxions of %0athe eyes, and to sores upon the generative organs, and ulcera¬ %0ations, with barley meal. The juice is used as an injection for %0athe ears. %0a%0aCHAP. 9.-THE ANDKOSACES : SIX REMEDIES. %0a%0aThe androsaces 46 is a white plant, bitter, without leaves, and %0abearing arms surmounted with follicules, containing the seed. %0aIt grows in the maritime parts of Syria, more particularly. %0aThis plant is administered for dropsy, in doses of two drachmae, %0apounded or boiled, in either -water, wine, or vinegar: it acts %0amost powerfully as a diuretic. It is used also for gout, either %0ataken internally or used as a liniment. The seed is possessed %0aof similar properties. %0a%0aCHAP. 10.—ANDROSJEMON OE ASCYEON : SIX REMEDIES. %0a%0aAndrossemon 47 or, as some persons call it, “ascyron,” is not %0aunlike hypericon, a plant of which we have spoken already : 48 %0athe stems, however, are larger, redder, and lie more closely %0atogether. The leaves are of a white colour, and like those of %0arue in shape; the seed resembles that of the black poppy, and %0athe upper branches, when bruised, emit a red juice the colour %0aof blood: these branches have also a resinous smell. %0a%0aThis plant grows in vineyards, and it is usually in the middle %0a%0a43 In c. 80 of this Book. %0a%0a44 The Parietaria officinalis; see B. xxii. c. 19. %0a%0a45 He has previously stated that it grows in the woods. The fact is, %0aM. Fraas says, that it grows equally upon garden walls, heaps of rubbish, %0ain plains, upon shady rocks, and upon mountains, below an elevation of %0a1500 feet. %0a%0a46 Generally supposed not to be a vegetable production, but a Madrepore. %0aFee identifies it with the Madrepora acetabulum of Linnaeus. %0a%0a47 “ Man’s blood.” Identified by Sprengel with the Hypericum monta- %0anum, and by Sibtliorp and Fee with the Hypericum perforatum, of Lin¬ %0anaeus, Perforated tutsan or St. John’s wort. 48 See B. xxvi. cc. 53, 54. %0a%0aVOL. V. Q %0a%0a%0a%0a226 %0a%0a%0apliny’s natural history. %0a%0a%0a[Book XXVII. %0a%0a%0aof autumn that it is taken up and hung to dry. Used as a %0apurgative, it is bruised with the seed, and taken in the morn¬ %0aing or just after the evening meal, in doses of two drachmae, %0ain hydromel, wine, or pure water, the draught amounting to %0aone sextarius in all. It carries off bile, and is particularly %0agood for sciatica; but in this last case, caper root must be %0ataken with resin the day after, the dose being one drachma, %0ato be repeated every four days : after being purged, it is the %0apractice for the patient, if in robust health, to take wine, but %0aif in a weak state of body, water. It is employed topically, %0aalso, for gout, burns, and wounds, as it tends to arrest the flow %0aof blood. %0a%0aCHAP. 11.-AMBROSIA, BOTRYS, OR ARTEMISIA - . THREE REMEDIES. %0a%0aAmbrosia is a vague name, which has fluctuated between %0avarious plants : there is one, 49 however, which has been more %0aparticularly designated by this appellation, a branchy, shrub¬ %0alike plant, with a thin stem, some three palms in height; the %0aroot of it is one third shorter, and the leaves, towards the lower %0apart of the stem, resemble those of rue. Its diminutive %0abranches bear a seed which hangs down in clusters, and has a %0avinous smell: hence it is that by some persons the plant is %0acalled “ botrys,” 80 while to others it is known as “ artemisia.” %0aThe people of Cappadocia use it for garlands. It is employed %0ain medicine as a resolvent. %0a%0aCHAP. 12.-THE ANONIS OR 0N0NI8 : FIVE REMEDIES. %0a%0aThe anonis, 81 by some called “ ononis” in preference, is a %0abranchy plant, and similar to fenugreek in appearance, except %0athat it is more shrub-like and more hairy. It has an agreeable %0asmell, and becomes prickly after spring. It is pickled in brine %0afor eating. Applied fresh to ulcers, it cauterizes the margins of %0athem. Tor the cure of tooth-ache, the root is boiled in oxy- %0acrate: taken in drink, with honey, the root expels urinary calculi. %0aFor epilepsy, it is administered in oxyrnel, boiled down to one %0ahalf. %0a%0aCHAP. 13.-THE ANAGYROS OB ACOPON : THREE REMEDIES. %0a%0aThe anagyros, known to some by the name of “ aco- %0a%0a49 Identified with the Ambrosia maritima of Linnaeus, the Sea ambrosia. %0a%0a50 The “cluster” plant. It still figures in the Materia Medica.

The seed grows in small %0ahornlike pods of considerable length, and resembles a kidney %0ain shape; it hardens about the time of harvest. The leaves of %0athis plant are applied to gatherings, and are attached to the %0aperson in cases of difficult parturition, care being taken to %0aremove them the moment after delivery. In cases where the %0aextraction of the dead foetus is attended with difficulty, or where %0athe after-birth or catamenia are retarded, the leaves are taken, in %0adoses of one drachma, in raisin wine. The leaves are adminis¬ %0atered in the same manner for asthma: they are prescribed also %0ain old wine, for injuries inflicted by the phalangium. 53 The %0aroot is employed medicinally as a resolvent and maturative: %0athe seed, chewed, acts as an emetic. %0a%0aCHAr. 14.-THE ANONYMOS : TWO REMEDIES. %0a%0aThe anonymos, 54 through not having a name, has at last %0afound one. 55 It is brought from Scythia, and has been highly %0aextolled by Hicesius, a physician of no small repute, as also %0aby Aristogiton. Bruised in water and applied, it is remarkably %0auseful for wounds, and taken in drink it is good for blows upon %0athe chest or mamillae, as also for spitting of blood: it has %0abeen thought, too, that it might be advantageously taken in a %0apotion for wounds. I am of opinion that the additional state¬ %0ament, to the effect that, burnt fresh, it acts as a solder to iron %0aor copper, is wholly fabulous. %0a%0aCHAP. 15.

It is a purgative, and its seeds are emetic. %0a%0a52 See B. viii. c. 41, B. x. c. 95, B. xi. cc. 24, 28. %0a%0a54 It has not been identified, Pliny being the only author that has men¬ %0ationed it. The Ajuga pyramidalis of Linnaeus, and the Ajuga iva have %0abeen suggested. 55 “ Anonymos,” or “ nameless.” %0a%0a56 See B. xviii. c. 44, and B. xxiv. c. 116. It is identified with the Galium %0aAparine of Linnaeus, Ladies’ bedstraw, Cleavers, goosegrass, hariff, or %0acatchweed. Its medicinal properties are next to nothing. %0a%0a51 “Navel-fruit.” w “Man-loving.” See B. xxiv. c. 116. %0a%0a%0a228 %0a%0a%0apliny’s natural history. %0a%0a%0a[Book XXVII. %0a%0a%0aThe seed is round, hard, concave, and of a sweetish taste. It %0agrows in cornfields, gardens, and meadows, and, by the aid of %0aits prickly points, adheres to the clothes. The seed is em¬ %0aployed to neutralize the venom of serpents, being taken in %0adoses of one drachma, in •wine : it is useful also for the bite of %0athe phalangium. 59 The leaves, applied topically, arrest hae¬ %0amorrhage from wounds. The juice is used as an injection for %0athe ears. %0a%0aCHAP. 16.-THE ARCTION OK AKCT01UTM : FIVE REMEDIES. %0a%0aThe arction C0 is by some called “ arcturum” in preference: %0athe leaves of it are like those of verbascum, 61 except that they %0aare more hairy; the stem is long and soft, and the seed resem¬ %0ables that of cummin. It grows in rocky localities, and has a %0atender root, white and sweet. A decoction of it is made with %0awine for tooth-ache, being retained for that purpose in the %0amouth. The plant is taken in drink for sciatica and strangury, %0aand is applied with wine to burns and chilblains, which are %0afomented also with the root and seed bruised in wine. %0a%0aCHAP. 17.—THE ASPLENON OK HEMIONION : TWO REMEDIES. %0a%0aSome persons call the asplenon 62 by the name of “ hemio- %0anion.” 63 It has numerous leaves, a third of a foot in length, %0aand a slimy root, pierced with holes like that of fern, white, %0aand hairy. It is destitute of stem, flower, and seed, 64 and is %0afound growing upon rocks or sheltered damp walls. The most %0aapproved kind is that of Crete. A decoction of the leaves %0ain vinegar, taken in drink for a period of thirty days, will %0a%0a59 See Note 53 above. %0a%0a60 Brotero and Linnaeus identify it with the Arctium lappa of Linnaeus, %0athe Burdock or clot-burr: Sibthorp with the Conyza Candida, the White %0afleabane: others, again, with the Celsia arcturus of Linnaeus, and Sprengel %0awith the Verbascum ferrugineum of Linnaeus, the Ferruginous mullein; %0abetween which two last, Fee is unable to decide. %0a%0a61 See B. xxv. c. 73. %0a%0a62 So called from its supposed property of consuming the spleen. It is %0agenerally identified with the Asplenium ceterach of Linnaeus, Spleenwort, %0aor miltwaste. The Asplenium hemionitis of Linnaeus, Mule’s fern, and %0athe Asplenium scolopendrium of Linnaeus, Hart’s tongue, have also been %0asuggested; but Fee prefers the first-named plant. %0a%0a63 The “ mule’s plant.” These animals rvere said to be very fond of it. %0a%0a64 This is incorrect: the Ceterach has a large quantity of seed, but it %0ais concealed beneath a kind of downy substance. %0a%0a%0aChap. 20.] %0a%0a%0aASCYBON. %0a%0a%0a229 %0a%0a%0aconsume the spleen, it is said, the leaves being applied simul¬ %0ataneously. The leaves give relief also in hiccup. This plant %0ashould never be given to females, being productive of sterility. %0a%0aCHAP. 18.-THE ASCLEPIAS : TWO REMEDIES. %0a%0aThe asclepias 65 has leaves like those of ivy, 66 long branches, %0aand numerous roots, thin, and odoriferous. The flower has a %0astrong offensive smell, and the seed is like that of securidaca: 67 %0ait is found growing in mountainous districts. The roots are %0aused for the cure of griping pains in the bowels, and of %0astings inflicted by serpents, either taken in drink or applied %0atopically. %0a%0aCHAP. 19.-THE ASTER OR BUBONION: THREE REMEDIES. %0a%0aThe aster 68 is called “ bubonion” by some, from the circum¬ %0astance of its being a sovereign remedy for diseases of the %0agroin. It has a diminutive stem with oblong leaves, two or %0athree in number ; and at the summit it is surmounted with small %0aradiated heads, like stars. This plant is taken also in drink %0aas an antidote to the venom of serpents: but if required for %0athe cure of inguinal complaints, it is recommended that it %0ashould be gathered with the left hand, and attached to the %0abody near the girdle. It is of great service also, worn as an %0aamulet, for sciatica. %0a%0aCHAP. 20.-ASCYKON AND ASCYROIDES : THREE REMEDIES. %0a%0aAscyron 69 and ascyroi'des are plants similar to one another, %0aand to hypericon 70 as well, except that the plant known as %0a%0a65 Possibly the Asclepias vincetoxicum of Linnaeus, the Common white- %0aflower swallow-wort; though Fee considers it somewhat doubtful. %0a%0a66 Those of Swallow-wort have no such resemblance. %0a%0a67 See B. xviii. c. 44. %0a%0a6H Desfontaines suggests the Inula bubonium, but Fee adopts the opinion %0aof Jussieu and Sprengel, that it is the Aster amellus of Linnaeus, the %0aItalian star wort. It is probably the same plant as the Inguinalis, men¬ %0ationed in B. xxvi. c. 59. %0a%0a69 Identified by Fee and Desfontaines with the Hypericum androsaemum %0aot Linnaeus, the Common tutsan, or Park leaves. Littre gives as the %0asynonym the Hypericum perforatum of Linnaeus, the Perforated St.John’s %0awort; which last is also preferred by Sprengel. I’uchsius and Mathioli %0athink that it is the Hypericum montanum of Linnaeus. %0a%0a70 See B. xxvi. c. 53. %0a%0a%0a230 %0a%0a%0aflint’s natural history. %0a%0a%0a[Book XXVII. %0a%0a%0a“ ascyro'ides” 71 has larger branches, ferulaceous, red all over, %0aand bearing small yellow heads. The seed, enclosed in small %0acalyces, is diminutive, black, and resinous. r lhe tops of the %0abranches, when bruised, stain like blood; for which reason %0asome persons have given it the name of “ androsaemon.”'" The %0aseed is used for the cure of sciatica, being taken in doses of %0atwo drachma?, in one sextarius of hydromel. It relaxes the %0abowels, and carries off bile : it is applied also to burns. %0a%0aCHAP. 21.-THE APHACA: THREE REMEDIES. %0a%0aThe aphaca 73 has remarkably diminutive leaves, and is %0abut little taller than the lentil. The pods are of a larger %0asize, and enclose some three or four seeds, of a darker colour, %0amoister, and more diminutive than those of the lentil: it grows %0ain cultivated fields. It is naturally more astringent than the %0alentil, but in other respects is applied to much the same pur¬ %0aposes. The seed, used in a decoction, arrests fluxes of the %0astomach and bowels. %0a%0aCHAP. 22.-ALCIBIUM : ONE REMEDY. %0a%0aI have not found it stated by authors what kind of plant %0aalcibium 74 is ; but the root, I find, and the leaves, are pounded %0aand employed, both externally and internally, for injuries in¬ %0aflicted by serpents. When the leaves are used, a handful of %0athem is bruised in three cyathi of undiluted wine: the root %0ais employed in the proportion of three drachmae to the same %0aquantity of wine. %0a%0aCHAP. 23.-ALECTOROSLOPHOS OR CRISTA : TWO REMEDIES. %0a%0aAlectoroslophos, 75 or crista, 75 * as we call it, has numerous %0a%0a71 It is considered to be identical with the Ascyron. %0a%0a73 “Man’s blood.” See c. 10 of this Book. %0a%0a73 Different probably from the plant of a similarname mentioned in B. xxi. %0acc. 52, 59. Fee identifies it with the Vetch, mentioned in B. xviii. c. 37. %0aLittre gives as its synonym the Vicia cracca of Linnaeus, the Tufted vetch, %0aand Desfontaines the Lathyrus aphaca, the Yellow vetchling, or bindweed. %0a%0a74 Fee considers it to be the same plant as the Anchusa or Archebion, %0amentioned in B. xxii. c. 25. Desfontaines identifies the Alcibium with %0athe Echium rubrum of Linnaeus. Holland observes here that Pliny %0a“ hath here forgotten himself.” %0a%0a75 “ Cock’s comb.” The Rhinanthus crista galli of Linnaeus, Yellow %0a%0arattle, or cock’s comb. 75 * “ Crest” or “ Comb.” %0a%0a%0aChap. 24.] %0a%0a%0aALUM. %0a%0a%0a231 %0a%0a%0aleaves resembling a cock’s comb, a thin stem, and a black seed %0aenclosed in pods. Boiled with brpken beans and honey, it is %0auseful for cough and for films upon the eyes. The seed, too, is %0asprinkled whole into the eyes, and so far is it from injuring %0athem, that it attracts and collects the filmy matter. When %0athus used, it changes colour, and from black becomes white, %0agradually swells, and comes out of itself. %0a%0aCL'AP. 24.

It grows %0aupon rocks, to which circumstance it is indebted for its addi- %0atonal name of “ petraeonand is extremely useful 79 for affec¬ %0ations of the sides and kidneys, griping pains in the bowels, %0adiseases of the chest and lungs, spitting of blood, and eruptions %0aof the fauces. The root is pounded and taken in drink, or else %0aa decoction is made of it in wine ; sometimes, also, it is ap¬ %0aplied externally. Chewed, it allays thirst, and is particularly %0arefreshing to the pulmonary organs. It is employed topically %0afor sprains and contusions, and has a soothing effect upon the %0aintestines. %0a%0aCooked upon hot ashes, with the follicules removed, and %0athen beaten up with nine peppercorns and taken in water, it %0aacts astringently upon the bowels.

Lobel identifies it with the Prunella vulgaris of %0aLinnaeus, Common self-heal, and Cajsalpinus with the Hyssopus officinalis %0aof Linnaeus. See B. xxvi. c. 26. %0a%0an Fee reiterates his assertion here that this “rock" symphytum is a %0atotally different plant from the Symphytum officinale, or Comfrey, though %0athey appear to have been generally considered as identical by Scribonius %0aLargus, Plinius Valerianus, Apuleius, and other writers. %0a%0a7,5 See B. xxvi. c. 26. %0a%0a9 This account of its medicinal properties applies properly to the Sym¬ %0aphytum officinale, or Great comfrey, a plant which would appear to have %0abeen confounded by Pliny with the Alum, if Fee is right in his conjecture. %0a%0a%0a232 %0a%0a%0aPLINY’S NATURAL HI8T0EY. %0a%0a%0a[Book xxvir. %0a%0a%0ais remarkably efficacioas, being possessed of agglutinating® %0aproperties to such a remarkable degree us to solder pieces of %0ameat together with which it is boiled ; to which, in fact, it is %0aindebted for its Greek name. 81 It is used also for the cure of %0afractured bones. %0a%0aCHAP. 25.

The %0aroot, boiled in three cyathi of water, with the addition of twe %0acyathi of Coan wine, is slightly laxative to the bowels, and is %0aconsequently given for dropsy. It is curative also of uterine %0aaffections, and of spots upon the face in females. It is found %0aa good plan for patients afflicted with sciatica to use the juice %0aof this plant, bruised, applied topically, with the leaves. %0a%0aCHAP. 28.-ABSINTHIUM OR WORMWOOD ; FOUR VARIETIES: %0a%0aFORTY-EIGHT REMEDIES. %0a%0aThere are numerous kinds of absinthium; the Santonic, 96 for %0a%0a80 Hence its Latin name “ consolida,” and its French name “ consoude.” %0aFee says that Comfrey still figures in the French Materia Medica, and that %0athe lower classes use it in most of the cases mentioned by Pliny; he states %0aalso, that it is destitute of energetic properties, in a medicinal point of view. %0a%0a81 2vn%3cpvrov, “ consolidating.” %0a%0a82 See B. xiii. c. 48, and B. xxvi. c. 66. %0a%0a83 The Actaea spicata of Linnaeus, Herb-christopher or bane-berries, is %0amentioned by Desfontaines; but Fee is inclined to identify it with the %0aSambucus ebulus of Linnaeus, the Dwarf elder, wall-wort, or dane-wort. %0a%0a81 See B. xxiii. c, 14. 85 In B. xxi. cc. 33, 38. %0a%0a86 The Artemisia Santonica of Linnaeus, Tartarian southernwood. %0a%0a%0aChap. 28.] %0a%0a%0aABSINTHIUM. %0a%0a%0a233 %0a%0a%0ainstance, so called from a city in Gaul, and the Pontic, 87 which %0acomes from Pontus, where the cattle are fattened upon it—a %0adiet which causes them to be destitute of gall. 88 The Pontic %0awormwood, we may remark, is of the finest quality, superior to %0athat of Italy, 89 and much more bitter; the pith, however, of the %0aPontic wormwood is sweet. As to its general utility, a plant %0aso commonly found and applied to such numerous uses, people %0aare universally agreed ; but with the Romans more particularly %0ait has been always held in the highest esteem, from the fact of %0aits being employed in their religious ceremonials. Thus, for %0ainstance, upon the Latin 90 Festival, it is the custom to have a %0arace of four-horsed chariots in the Capital, and for the conqueror %0ato be presented with a draught of wormwood; from the circum¬ %0astance, no doubt, that our forefathers were of opinion that good %0ahealth was the most valuable reward they could bestow upon %0ahis skill. %0a%0aThis plant is very strengthening to the stomach, and hence %0ait is that wines are flavoured with it, as already 91 stated. A %0adecoction of it in water is also taken, the following being %0athe method employed in preparing it. Six drachmae of the %0aleaves are boiled, with the branches, in three sextarii of rain %0awater, and the preparation is then left to cool in the open air a %0aday and anight. Salt, too, should be added to it. When old, it %0ais utterly useless. A dilution of wormwood steeped in water %0ais also used, such being the name 92 given to this method of %0apreparing it. This dilution is made by leaving the vessel %0acovered up for three days, any kind of water being used. %0aPounded wormwood is but rarely employed, and the same %0awith the extracted juice of the seed. 93 In cases, however, %0awhere it is extracted, the seed is subjected to pressure as soon %0aas it begins to swell, after which it is soaked for three days %0ain water, if used fresh, and seven, if dry. It is then boiled %0ain a copper vessel, in the proportion of ten heminae to forty- %0afive sextarii of water, after which it is strained off and boiled %0a%0a87 The Artemisia Pontica of Linnaeus, Little wormwood, or Roman %0awormwood. 88 See B. xi. c. 75. %0a%0a89 The Artemisia absinthium of Linnaeus, Common wormwood. %0a%0a90 Upon which occasion a sacrifice was offered on the Alban Mount. %0aSee further as to this Festival, in B. iii. c. 2. %0a%0a91 In B. xiv. c. 19.

The juice, however, %0aof wormwood, thus extracted, is bad for the head and stomach; %0awhereas the decoction, on the other hand, is wholesome in the %0ahighest degree, as it acts astringently upon the stomach, carries %0aoff bile, is a powerful diuretic, has a soothing effect upon the %0abowels, and assuages pains in the intestines. With the addi¬ %0ation of sile, 94 Gallic nard, and a little vinegar, it dispels nausea %0aand flatulency, and expels intestinal worms. It removes %0aqualmishness, promotes the digestion, and, with the addition %0aof rue, pepper, and salt, disperses crudities of the stomach. %0a%0aThe ancients were in the habit of giving wormwood as a %0apurgative, the dose being six drachmae of the seed with three %0aof salt and one cyathus of honey, in one sextarius of sea water %0akept for some time. This preparation, however, is rendered %0amore efficacious by doubling the proportion of salt; the seed, %0atoo, must be bruised with the greatest care, as there is con¬ %0asiderable difficulty in pounding it. Some authorities have %0aprescribed the dose above mentioned to be given in polenta, 94 %0awith the addition of pennyroyal; while others recommend %0athe leaves to be given to children in a dried fig, to disguise %0atheir bitterness. Taken with iris, 96 wormwood acts as a %0adetergent upon the thoracic organs: for jaundice it is used %0araw, with parsley or adiantum. 97 In cases of flatulency, it is %0asipped every now and then, warmed in water; for liver com¬ %0aplaints it is taken with Gallic nard, and for diseases of the %0aspleen, with vinegar, pap, 98 or figs. Taken in vinegar it neu¬ %0atralizes the bad effects of fungi and of viscus in wine it is %0aan antidote to the poison of hemlock, and to the bite of the %0ashrew-mouse, and is curative of wounds inflicted by the sea- %0adragon 1 and the scorpion. It contributes also very greatly to %0athe improvement of the sight, and is used as an external appli¬ %0acation, with raisin wine, for defluxions of the eyes, and with %0ahoney, for bruises. %0a%0a94 See B. xx. c. 18. 95 See B. xviii. c. 14. %0a%0a96 See B. xxi. c. 19. 97 See B. xxii. c. 30. %0a%0a93 “ Puls.” See B. xviii. c. 19. %0a%0a99 From a passage in Scribonius Largus, c. 191, it has been concluded %0athat by the word “ visco,” he means the juice of the Ixias or Chamaeleon, %0amentioned in B. xxii. c. 21. %0a%0a1 See B. ix. c. 43, and B. xxxii. c. 53. %0a%0a%0aChap. 29.] %0a%0a%0aABSINTHIUM MAEINUM. %0a%0a%0a235 %0a%0a%0aThe steam of a decoction of wormwood is curative of affec¬ %0ations of the ears; and when they are attacked with running %0asores, a liniment of wormwood bruised with honey is applied. %0aThree or four sprigs of wormwood, with one root of Gallic %0anard, taken in six cyathi of water, act as a diuretic and as %0aan eramenagogue; indeed, if taken with honey, or employed %0aas a pessary with wool, it has especial virtues as an emmena- %0agogue. In combination with honey and nitre it is useful for %0aquinzy, and an infusion of it in water is good for epinyctis. %0aA topical application is made of it for recent wounds, provided %0aalways they have not been touched with water: it is em¬ %0aployed also for ulcers upon the head. In combination with %0aCyprian wax or figs, it is highly recommended as a plaster for %0athe iliac regions: it is curative also of prurigo, but it must %0anever be administered in fevers. Taken in drink, it is a pre¬ %0aventive of sea sickness; and, worn attached to the body, %0abeneath an apron, it arrests inguinal swellings. The smell of %0ait 2 induces sleep, a similar effect being produced by placing %0ait under the pillow unknown to the party.

THE %0aCEMOS I ONE OBSERVATION UPON IT. %0a%0aThe catanance 15 is a Thessalian plant, which it would be %0aa mere loss of time to describe, seeing that it is only used as %0aan ingredient in philtres. In order, however, to expose the %0afollies of the magical art, it may not be out of place to remark %0athat this plant has been selected for the above-named purpose, %0afrom the fact that, as it withers, it gradually contracts and %0aassumes the shape of the claws of a dead kite . 16 %0a%0aFor a similar reason we shall give no description of the %0aplant called “ cemos .” 17 %0a%0apbrastus, Hist. iv. 7, that it was a name for sea-weed in general, and not %0au specific plant. %0a%0aIn reality, it is destitute of medicinal properties. Some kinds of laver %0aare considered a dainty food. %0a%0a13 See B. xxii. c. 35. 14 See B. xx. c. 67. %0a%0a15 Dioscorides speaks of two kinds of Catanance ; one of which has %0abeen identified hy Sprengel with the Ornithopus compressus of Linnaeus, %0aand the other with the Astragalus pugniformis.

One of these resembles %0aarum, and is found growing in ploughed soils; the proper %0atime for gathering it being before it begins to wither. It is em¬ %0aployed for the same purposes as arum ; 19 and an infusion of the %0aroot is taken as a purgative and as an emmenagogue. The %0astalks, boiled with the leaves and some pulse, are curative of %0atenesmus. %0a%0aCHAP. 37. -THE CALYX, KNOWN ALSO AS ANCHUSA OR ONOCLIA : %0a%0aTWO REMEDIES. %0a%0aThe other 20 kind of calyx is known by some persons as %0a“ anchusa,” and by others as “ onoclia.” The leaves are like %0athose of the lettuce, but longer, and with a downy surface. %0aThe root is red, and is employed topically, in combination %0awith fine polenta , 21 for the cure of erysipelas: taken inter¬ %0anally with white wine, it is good for affections of the liver. %0a%0aCHAP. 38. -THE CIRCAEA : THREE REMEDIES. %0a%0aThe circaea 22 resembles the cultivated trychnon 23 in ap¬ %0apearance. It has a small swarthy flower, a diminutive seed, %0alike millet, growing in small horn-shaped pods, and a root %0ahalf a foot in length, generally triple or fourfold, white, %0aodoriferous, and hot in the mouth. It is found growing upon %0arocks exposed to the sun. An infusion of it is prepared with %0awine, and administered for pains and affections of the uterus: %0ato make it, three ounces of the pounded root should be steeped %0a%0a18 Other readings are “calsa, ” and “calla;” but “calyx” is supported %0aby the text of Dioscorides, B. iv. c. 23. The first kind has been generally %0aidentified with the Arum arisarum of Linnaeus, Hooded arum, or Honk’s %0ahood, and is identical probably with the Aris aros of B. xxiv. c. 94. %0a%0a19 See B. xxiv. c. 93. %0a%0a20 Probably the Anchusa tinctoria of Linnaeus, Dyer’s alkanet.

Other authorities have suggested the %0aCapsicum annuum of Linnaeus, Indian or Guinea pepper, and the Celosia %0amargaritacea of Linnaeus, Pearly celosia, or cock's comb. M.

The prickles on the leaves are %0adowny, and the leaves themselves resemble those of buglos- %0asos 25 in shape, but are smaller, and of a whitish colour. At %0athe summit of the plant there are small purple heads, which %0afall off in the shape of down. This plant or the root of it, %0aworn as an amulet, it is said, is curative of the pains attendant %0aupon varicose veins. %0a%0aCHAP. 40.- THE cuat^gonon; two kinds of it : EIGHT %0a%0aBEJIEDIES. %0a%0aThe crataegonon 20 is similar to an ear of corn in appearance. %0aIt is formed of numerous shoots, springing from a single root, %0aand full of joints. It grows in umbrageous localities, and has %0aa seed like that of millet, with a remarkably acrid taste. If %0aa man and woman, before the evening meal, take three oboli of %0athis seed in three cyathi of water, for forty days consecutively, %0abefore the conception of their issue, it will be sure to be of the %0amale 27 sex, they say. %0a%0aThere is another crataegonon, known also as “ thelygonos,” 2 ® %0aand distinguished from the last mentioned plant by the mild¬ %0aness of the taste. Some persons assert that females, if they %0atake the blossom of this plant in drink, will be sure to con¬ %0aceive before the end of forty days. These plants, used in com¬ %0abination with honey, are curative of black ulcers of a chronic %0anature; they also fill the concavities made by fistulous %0a%0a24 Identified with the Carduus parvifloras of Linnaeus, the Small-flowered %0athistle. 25 See B. xxv. c. 40. %0a%0a26 Identified by Fee and Desfontaines with the Polygonum persicaria of %0aLinnaeus, the Spotted persicaria, red-shanks, fleawort, or lakeweed.

It is found growing in sandy soils. Taken %0ain drink, it causes a copious discharge of coagulated blood at %0athe nostrils, and in this way, it is said, diminishes the volume %0aof the spleen. %0a%0aCHAP. 42. -THE CYNOSORCHIS OR ORCHIS : FOUR REMEDIES. %0a%0aThe cynosorchis , 33 by some called “ orchis,” has leaves like 14 %0athose of the olive, soft, three in number, half a foot in length, %0aand lying upon the ground. The root is bulbous, oblong, and %0adivided into two portions , 35 the upper one hard, and the lower %0aone soft. These roots are eaten boiled, like bulbs , 38 and are %0amostly found growing in vineyards. If males eat the upper %0apart, they will be parents of male issue, they .say, and females, %0aif they eat the lower part, of female. In Thessaly, the men %0atake the soft portion in goats’ milk as an aphrodisiac, and the %0ahard part as an antaphrodisiac. Of these parts, the one effec¬ %0atually neutralizes the action of the other . 31 %0a%0a29 See B. xxiv. c. 72. Littre remarks that Pliny is in error here, for %0athat the Cratsegos of Theophrastus is the Cratsegos azarolia of Linnaeus, %0athe Parsley-leaved hawthorn, while the Aquifolia of Pliny is the Holly. %0aAs to the latter point, see B. xvi. cc. 8, 12. %0a%0a30 Hist.

There is another kind 39 of %0achrysolachanum mentioned, with a golden flower, and a leaf %0alike that of the cabbage : it is boiled and eaten as a laxative %0avegetable. This plant, worn as an amulet by a patient suffer¬ %0aing from jaundice, provided it be always kept in sight, is a cure %0afor that disease, it is said. 1 am not certain whether this is %0aall that might be said about the chrysolachanum, but, at %0aall events, it is all that I have found respecting it; for it is %0aa very general fault on the part of our more recent herbalists, %0ato confine their account of plants to the mere name, with a %0avery meagre description of the peculiar features of the plant, %0a—just as though, forsooth, they were universally known. Thus, %0athey tell us, for instance, that a plant known as “ coagulum 40 %0aterra,” acts astringently upon the bowels, and that it dispels %0astrangury, taken in water or in wflne. %0a%0aCHAI*. 44. —THE CCCUBALTJS, ST RUM US, OR STRYCHNON : SIX %0aREMEDIES. %0a%0aThe leaves of the cucubalus, 41 they tell us, bruised with %0avinegar, are curative of the stings of serpents and of scorpions. %0aSome persons call this plant by the name of “ strumus,” 42 %0awhile others give it the Greek name of “ strychnon its ber¬ %0aries are black.

That, %0aon the other hand, which grows at a greater distance and more %0ainland, is of a more bitter flavour. It carries off the aqueous %0ahumours of the body, being taken for that purpose in broth of %0asome kind, or else hydromel. When old, it loses its strength; %0abut used fresh, either boiled in water or pounded, it acts as a %0adiuretic, and disperses urinary calculi.

Swine are fattened upon the roots of either kind. %0aThe leaves of both kinds are arranged on either side in the %0aform of wings, whence the Greek name “ pteris.” The roots %0aare long, run obliquely, and are of a swarthy colour, more par- %0a%0a64 Because it was said to be a cause of sterility. %0a%0aM Identified with the Dentaria enneaphylla of Linnaeus, the Nine-leaved %0atooth-wort. %0a%0a66 From this remark, Fee is of opinion that he had in view more par¬ %0aticularly the Pteris aquilina and the Blechnum spicatum of Linnaeus, plants %0ain which the seed is not easily detected. %0a%0a67 Identified by Fee with the Polypodium filix mas of Linnaeus, the Male %0afern. %0a%0a60 Dioscorides says it has a somewhat unpleasant smell, and this is nearer %0athe truth. %0a%0a69 “ Female fern.” Identified by Fee with the Polypodium filix faemina %0aof Linnaeus, Female fern or Pteris aquilina. %0a%0a%0a246 %0a%0a%0apliny’s natural history. %0a%0a%0a[Hook xxvir. %0a%0a%0aticularly when dried : when wanted for use, they should be %0adried in the sun. These plants are found growing everywhere, %0abut in cold soils more particularly; they should be taken up, %0atoo, at the setting of the Vergiliac. 70 The root is only used at the %0aend of three years, neither before that period nor after. They %0aact as an expellent of intestinal worms ; for tapeworm' 1 honey %0ais taken with them, but in other cases sweet wine, for three days. %0a%0aThey are, both of them, extremely detrimental to the sto¬ %0amach, but are laxative to the bowels, carrying off first the bile %0aand then the aqueous humours of the body. When used for %0atapeworm, it is the best plan to take scammony with them, in %0aequal proportions. For rheumatic defluxions, the root is taken %0ain doses of two oboli, in water, after a day’s abstinence from %0afood, a little honey being taken first. Neither kind must ever %0abe given to females ; for in pregnancy they are productive of %0aabortion, and in other cases entail sterility. Powdered fern is %0asprinkled upon sordid ulcers, as also upon the necks of beasts %0aof burden, when chafed. Fern-leaves kill bugs, and serpents %0awill never harbour among them : hence it is a good plan to %0astrew them in places where the presence of those reptiles is %0asuspected. The very smell, too, of burnt fern will put serpents %0ato flight.

Bauhin has suggested %0athe Leonurus cardiaca of Linnaeus, Motherwort. %0a%0a13 It has been suggested that this plant is the same as the Laminin, %0amentioned in B. xxii. c. 16, but Fee is not of that opinion. He identifies %0athe Galeopsis with the Lamium purpureum of Linnaeus, the Purple arch¬ %0aangel, or dead-nettle. Littre gives as its synonym the Scrofularia pere- %0agrina of Linnaeus, the Foreign figwort. %0a%0a%0aChap. 59.] %0a%0a%0aGLAUCION. %0a%0a%0a247 %0a%0a%0ais a plant with a stem and leaves like those of the nettle, only- %0asmaller ; and which, when bruised, emit a powerful smell. The %0aflower is purple, and the plant is found growing everywhere, %0aabout hedges and foot-paths. The leaves and stems, bruised in %0avinegar, and applied topically, are curative of indurations, %0acarcinomata, and scrofulous sores. They disperse also inflam¬ %0amatory tumours and imposthumes of the parotid glands, and %0ait is found a useful plan to foment the parts affected with a %0adecoction of them. Applied with salt, this plant is curative %0aof putrid ulcers and gangrenous sores. %0a%0aCHAP. 58.- THE GLAUX : ONE REMEDY. %0a%0aThe glaux 74 was known in ancient times as the “ eugalac- %0aton.” 75 In the leaves it resembles the cytisus and the lentil, %0aonly that they are whiter beneath. The branches, five or six %0ain number, are extremely thin, and, springing from the root, %0acreep upon the ground, with small purple blossoms upon them. %0aThis plant is found in localities near the sea. It is boiled in %0aa pottage made of similago, 76 to increase the milk: females, %0ahowever, after taking it, must immediately use the bath. %0a%0aCHAP. 59. (10.)— GLAUCION : THREE REMEDIES. DIAGLAUCIA : %0a%0aTWO REMEDIES. %0a%0aGlaucion 77 grows in Syria and Parthia; it is a plant of %0astunted growth, and thickly covered with leaves, like those of %0athe poppy in appearance, only smaller and of a more repulsive %0aaspect: it has an offensive smell, and a bitter, astringent taste. %0aThe 6eed, which is of a saffron colour, is put into a vessel %0acoated with potter’s clay, and heated in an oven ; when taken %0aout, a juice 78 is extracted, which is known by the same name as %0athe plant. This juice and the leaves, bruised, are used for de¬ %0afluxions of the eyes, which disappear in an instant, under this %0a%0a74 Fee thinks that it may possibly be the Astragalus glaux of Linnaeus, %0aor Milk vetch, as originally suggested by Clusius. Littre gives as its %0asynonym the Senncbierra coronopus of Poireau. %0a%0a11 The “ Good milk ” plant. %0a%0a16 See B. xviii. cc. 19, 20. %0a%0a77 See B. xx. c. 78, where a similar plant is mentioned. Fee identifies %0athis plant with the Glaucium hybridum, or Chelidonium of Linnaeus, %0athe Violet-coloured celandine, or horned poppy. Littr6 gives the Glau¬ %0acium flavum of Linnaeus as its synonym. %0a%0a711 This is a yellow, acrid, caustic juice ; it is no longer used in medicine. %0a%0a%0a2-18 %0a%0a%0aPLI> t Y’8 natural histoet. %0a%0a%0a[Book XXVII. %0a%0a%0atreatment: an eye-salve, too, is prepared from the juice, known %0aas “ diaglaucia,” to medical men. The milk, when the secretion %0aof it is stopped, is restored by the agency of this plant, for which %0apurpose it is taken in water. %0a%0aCHAP. 60.— THE GLYCYS1DE, P^ONIA, OR rENTOROBOS : TWENTY %0aREMEDIES. %0a%0aThe glycyside, 79 by some called “ pseonia” or “ pentorobos,” %0ahas a stem two cubits in length, accompanied by two or three %0aothers, and of a reddish colour, with a bark like that of the %0alaurel. The leaves are similar to those of isatis, 80 but more %0aunctuous, rounder, and more diminutive; the seed is enclosed %0ain capsules, some being red and some black, there being %0atwo varieties of the plant. The female plant is generally %0athought to be the one to the root of which some six or eight %0abulbs are attached, of an elongated form; those of the male %0aplant 61 being more in number, as it throws out more roots than %0aone, a palm in length, and of a white colour : it has also an %0aastringent taste. The leaves of the female plant smell like %0amyrrh, 83 and lie closer together than those of the male. %0a%0aBoth plants grow in the woods, and they should always be %0ataken up at night, 83 it is said; as it would be dangerous to do %0aso in the day-time, the woodpecker of Mars being sure to %0aattack the eyes 94 of the person so engaged. It is stated also %0athat the person, while taking up the root, runs great risk of %0abeing attacked with procidence of the anus : all this, however, %0aI take to be so much fiction, most frivolously invented to puff %0aoff their supposed marvellous properties. Both plants are used 85 %0afor various purposes: the red seed, taken in red wine, about %0afifteen in number, arrest menstruation ; while the black seed, %0ataken in the same proportion, in either raisin or other wine, %0aare curative of diseases of the uterus. The root, taken in wine, %0aallays all kinds of pains in the bowels, and acts as a purgative; %0ait cures opisthotony also, jaundice, nephritic diseases, and affec¬ %0ations of the bladder. Boiled in wine, it is used for diseases of %0a%0a79 The Peony; described in B. xxv. c. 10. %0a%0a80 See B. xx. c. 25, and B. xxii. c. 2. 81 See B. xxv. c. 10. %0a%0a83 In reality it is destitute of smell. %0a%0a8J See B. xxv. c. 10. %0a%0a84 Or, as Holland says, would “ be ready to job out their eyes." %0a%0a65 In reality, the peony has no medicinal virtues whatever. %0a%0a%0aChap. 62.] %0a%0a%0aTHE GALLIDRAGA. %0a%0a%0a2-19 %0a%0a%0athe trachea and stomach, and acts astringently upon the bowels. %0aIt is eaten also by beasts of burden, but when wanted for %0aremedial purposes, four drachmae are sufficient. %0a%0aThe black seed is useful as a preventive of night-mare, 66 %0abeing taken in wine, in number above stated : it is very good, %0atoo, to eat this seed, and to apply itexternally, for gnawing pains %0aof the stomach. Suppurations are also dispersed, when recen t, %0awith the black seed, and when of long standing, with the red : %0aboth kinds are very useful, too, for wounds inflicted by ser¬ %0apents, and in cases where children are troubled with calculi, %0abeing employed at the crisis when strangury first makes its %0aappearance. %0a%0aCHAP. 61. -GNAPHALIUM OR CHAM.EZELON : SIX REMEDIES. %0a%0aGnaphalium 87 is called “ chamsezelon” by some : its white, %0asoft, leaves are used as flock, and, indeed, there is no per¬ %0aceptible difference. This plant is administered in astringent %0awine, for dysentery : it arrests looseness of the bowels and %0athe catamenia, and is used as an injection for tenesmus. It is %0aemployed topically for putrid sores. %0a%0aCHAP. 62.- THE GALLIDRAGA: ONE REMEDY. %0a%0aXenocrates gives the name of “ gallidraga” 88 to a plant %0awhich resembles the leucacanthus, 89 and grows in the marshes. %0aIt is a prickly plant, with a tall, ferulaceous stem, surmounted %0awith a head somewhat similar to an egg in appearance. When %0athis head is growing, in summer, small worms, 90 he says, are %0agenerated, which are put away in a box for keeping, and are %0aattached as an amulet, with bread, to the arm on the side on %0awhich tooth-ache is felt; indeed it is quite wonderful, he says, %0ahoiv soon the pain is removed. These worms, however, are of %0ano use after the end of a year, or in cases where they have been %0aallowed to touch the ground. %0a%0a86 “ Suppressionibus nocturnis.” %0a%0a87 Sprengel identifies it with the Santolina maritima, Sea cudwort or %0acotton-weed. Fee considers its identification as doubtful. %0a%0a68 Identified by Hardouin and Desfontaines with the Dipsacus pilosus of %0aLinnaeus, the Shepherd’s rod, or small white teasel. Fee is doubtful on %0athe subject. %0a%0a69 See B. xxii. c. 18. 90 See B. xxv. c. 28. %0a%0a%0a250 %0a%0a%0aPLINY’S NATURAL HI8TOBY.

Attached to the head or around the arm, %0ait extracts 92 spikes of corn adhering to the flesh; for which %0areason, some persons give it the name of “ aristis.” %0a%0aCHAP. 64. -HYOSERIS I ONE REMEDY. %0a%0aHyoseris 92 * resembles endive in appearance, but is a smaller %0aplant, and rougher to the touch : pounded and applied to %0awounds, it heals them with remarkable rapidity. %0a%0aCHAP. 65. -THE HOLOSTEON : THREE REMEDIES. %0a%0aThe holosteon, 93 so called by the Greeks by way of anti- %0aphrasis, 94 (in the same way that they give the name of %0a“sweet” 95 to the gall,) is a plant destitute of all hardness, of %0asuch extreme fineness as to resemble hairs in appearance, four %0afingers in length, and very similar to hay-grass. The leaves of it %0aare narrow, and it has a rough flavour : it grows upon elevated %0aspots composed of humus. Taken in wine, it is used for rup¬ %0atures and convulsions. It has the property, also, of closing %0awounds; indeed, if applied to pieces of meat it will solder %0athem together. %0a%0aCHAP. 66.-THE HIPPOPHiESTON ! EIGHT REMEDIES. %0a%0aThe hippophaeston is one of those prickly plants which %0afullers 96 use in their coppers ; it has neither stem nor flower, %0a%0a91 Identified with the Hordeum murinum of Linnaeus, and the same, %0amost probably, as the Mouse barley of B. xxii. c. 6-5. %0a%0a92 Whence its name, from the Greek e\kui, “to draw.” %0a%0a“Swine’s endive.” It is generally identified with the Centaurea %0anigra of Linnaeus; though, as Fee says, on very insufficient grounds, as %0athe black centaury has but little similarity to endive. %0a%0a93 The “ all-hone ” plant. Desfontaines identifies it with the Plantago %0acoronopus of Linnaeus, the Buckshorn plantain; but Fee prefers the Plan¬ %0atago holostea of Lamarck, the Grass-leaved plantain. Littre names the %0allolosteum umbellatum. The Plantago albicans of Linnaeus has been also %0amentioned. %0a%0a94 Because there is no hardness in it. 93 Td y\vKta. %0a%0a96 See B. xxiv. c. 68. In B. xvi. c. 92, Fee identifies this plant with the %0aCalcitrapa stellata of Lamarck. He also suggests that it may possibly be %0athe second “ Hippophaes,” mentioned in B. xxii. c. 14. Desfontaines %0aidentifies it with the Cnicus stellatus, the Star-thistle. Littre gives as its %0a%0a%0aTHE I80PYB0N. %0a%0a%0a251 %0a%0a%0aChap. 70.] %0a%0abut only diminutive, empty heads, numerous small leaves of a %0agrass-green colour, and 6inall, soft, white roots. From these %0aroots a juice is extracted in summer, which, taken in doses of %0athree oboli, acts as a purgative ; being used for this purpose in %0acases of epilepsy, fits of trembling, dropsy,vertigo, hardness of %0abreathing, and incipient paralysis. %0a%0aCHAP. 67. (11.) -THE HYPOGLOSSA : ONE BEMEDY. %0a%0aThe hypoglossa 97 is a plant with leaves like those of the %0awild myrtle, of a concave form, prickly, and presenting another %0asmall leaf within, resembling a tongue in shape. A wreath %0amade of these leaves, placed upon the head, alleviates head¬ %0aache. %0a%0a%0aCHAP. 68.—HYPECOON. %0a%0aHypecoon 9 * is a plant found growing in corn-fields, with %0aloaves like those of rue. Its properties are similar to those of %0ajuice of poppies. %0a%0aCHAT. 69. —THE IDA2A HEBBA, OB PLANT OF IDA : FOUB EEMF.DIES. %0a%0aThe Idaean" plant has leaves like those of the oxymyrsine ; l %0ato which leaves a sort of tendril adheres, that bears a flower. %0aThis plant arrests diarrhoea, the catamenia, when in excess, %0aand all kinds of haemorrhage. It is of an astringent and %0arepercussive nature. %0a%0aCnAP. 70.- THE ISOPYBON OB PHASIOLON : TWO BEMEDIES. %0a%0aThe isopyron 2 is called “ phasiolon” by some, from the cir¬ %0acumstance that the leaf of it, which resembles that of anise, %0aassumes a spiral form like the tendrils of the phasiolus. 3 At %0a%0asynonym the Centaurea spinosa, Prickly centaury ; in accordance with the %0aopinion of M. Fraas, who admits, however, that the statement that it has %0aneither stem nor flower, would hardly seem to indicate a species of centaury. %0a*• The Ruscus hypoglossum of Linnteus, the Double tongue. %0a%0a98 The Hypecoiim procuinbens of Liunams, Horned cummin. %0am Fee thinks that “ Idaea herba,” “ plant of Ida,” may possibly be one %0aof the synonyms of the Alexandrian laurel. See B. xv. c. 39. Should %0athat identity not hold good, he prefers the Uvularia amplexifolia of Linnmus. %0a%0a1 See B. xv. cc. 7, 37, and B. xxiii. c. 83. %0a%0a1 Fee suggests the Corydalis claviculata of Decandolle. Littrd mentions %0athe Fumaria capreolata of Linnaeus. %0a%0a3 Or kidney-bean.

When these buds %0aare dry, the seeds, about the size of a peppercorn, are taken out: %0athey are white, sweet, and easily cleansed from the husk. %0aTwenty of them, taken in pure water or in hydromel, are %0acurative of dropsy, and carry off bile. Persons who require a %0astronger purgative, take them with the husks on. They are %0aapt, however, to be injurious to the stomach ; for which reason %0aa plan has been adopted of taking them with fish or else %0achicken broth. %0a%0aCHAP. 72. -THE LEONTOPETALON OR PARDALION : TWO REMEDIES. %0a%0aThe leontopetalon 7 is called “ pardalion” by some: it has a %0aleaf like that of the cabbage, and a stem half a foot in height, %0awith numerous lateral branches, and a seed at the extremities %0aof them, enclosed in pods like those of the chick-pea. The root %0aresembles that of rape, and is large and black: it grows in %0aplough lands. The root, taken in wine, neutralizes the venom %0aof all kinds of serpents; indeed, there is nothing known that %0ais more speedily efficacious for that purpose. It is given also %0afor sciatica. %0a%0aCHAP. 73.- THELTCAPSOS: TWO REMEDIES. %0a%0aThe lycapsos 8 has longer and thicker leaves than those of %0athe lettuce, 9 and a long, hairy stem, with numerous offshoots a %0a%0a4 Or Gith. See B. xx. c. 71. %0a%0a5 The Euphorbia lathyris of Linnaeus, the Caper plant, or Caper spurge. %0a%0a6 There is no such resemblance, except that they both contain a milky %0ajuice, the properties of which are, however, very different. It is a plant %0aof an energetic and even dangerous nature, and must never be mistaken %0afor the real caper. %0a%0a7 Mostly thought to be the same plant as the Leontopodium of B. xxvi. c. %0a34. Littre, however, identifies it with the Evax pygmaeus of Linnaeus. %0a%0as Probably the Eehium Italicum of Linnaeus, Italian viper’s tongue. %0a%0a9 There is no resemblance between the Eehium and the lettuce. “ %0a%0a%0aChap. 74.] %0a%0a%0aTHE LITHOSPERMUM. %0a%0a%0a253 %0a%0a%0acubit in length; the flower is diminutive, and of a purple colour ; %0ait grows in champaign localities. In combination with barley- %0ameal, it is used as an application for erysipelas : the juice of %0ait, mixed with warm water, is employed as a sudorific, in %0afevers. %0a%0aCRAP. 74. -THE LITHOSPERMUM, EXONYCHON, DIOSPYRON, OR %0a%0aHERACLEOS : TWO REMEDIES. %0a%0aAmong all the plants, however, there is none of a more %0amarvellous nature than the lithospermum, 10 sometimes called %0a“exonychon,” “ diospyron,” 11 or “heracleos.” It is about five %0ainches in height, with leaves twice the size of those of rue, and %0asmall ligneous branches, about the thickness of a rush. It %0abears close to the leaves a sort of fine beard or spike, standing %0aby itself, on the extremity of which there are small white stones, %0aas round as a pearl, about the size of a chick-pea, and as hard as %0aa pebble. These stones, 12 at the part where they adhere to %0athe stalk, have a small cavity, and contain a seed within. %0a%0aThis plant is found in Italy, no doubt, but that of Crete is %0athe most esteemed. Among all the plants, there is none that %0aI ever contemplated with greater admiration than this; so %0abeauteous is the conformation, that it might be fancied that the %0ahand of an artist 13 had arranged a row of lustrous pearls alter¬ %0anately among the leaves ; so exquisite too the nicety in thus %0amaking a stone to grow upon a plant! The authorities say %0athat this is a creeping plant, and that it lies upon the ground ; %0abut for my own part, I have only seen it when plucked, and %0anot while growing. It is well known that these small stones, %0ataken in doses of one drachma, in white wine, break and %0aexpel urinary calculi, 14 and are curative of strangury. In¬ %0adeed, there is no plant that so instantaneously proclaims, at %0a%0a10 Identified by Fee and Desfontaines with the Lithospermum officinale %0aof Linnaeus, Gremil, gromwell, or stone-crop. Littre mentions the Lithos- %0apermum tenuifiorum of Linnaeus. %0a%0a11 “Jove’s wheat,” or the “plant of Hercules.” %0a%0a12 This description applies to the variety of Gremil, known as the Coix %0alacryma of Linnaeus, Job’s tears, originally an Indian plant; but it may %0ahave been known in Italy in Pliny’s time. %0a%0a11 A poor compliment to Nature, as Fee remarks. %0a%0a14 It has in reality no medicinal properties to speak of; but its name, %0a“stone seed,” and its appearance, would, of course, ensure its reputation as %0aan efficient cure for calculus. %0a%0a%0a%0a254 %0a%0a%0apliny’s NATURAL HISTORY. [Book XXY1I. %0a%0a%0athe mere sight of it, the medicinal purposes for which it was %0aoriginally intended; the appearunce of it, too, is such, that %0ait can be immediately recognized, without the necessity of %0ahaving recourse to any botanical authority. %0a%0aCHAP. 75.-LAPIDIS MUSCUS, OR STONE MOSS : ONE REMEDY. %0a%0aThere grows near running streams, a dry, white moss,' 6 upon %0aordinary stones. One of these stones, with the addition of %0ahuman saliva, is rubbed against another; after which the %0afirst stone is used for touching impetigo, 16 the party so doing %0auttering these words :— %0a%0a%3cbsiiyeri xavdapids?, "kvxog uypiog cu/ia diuxa. %0a%0a“ Cantliarides 17 begone, a wild wolf seeks your blood .” 16 %0a%0aCHAP. 76. -THE L1MEUM : ONE REMEDY. %0a%0aLimeum 19 is the name given by the Gauls to a plant, in a %0apreparation of which, known to them as “ deer’s 20 poison,” they %0adip their arrows 21 when hunting. To three modii of salivating %0amixture 22 they put as much of the plant as is used for poisoning %0aa single arrow ; and a mess of it is passed down the throat, %0ain cases where oxen are suffering from disease, due care being %0ataken to keep them fastened to the manger till they have been %0apurged, as they are generally rendered frantic by the dose. In %0acase perspiration supervenes, they are drenched all over with %0acold water. %0a%0aCHAP. 77. -THE LEUCE, MESOLEUCON, OK LEUCA8 : THKEB %0a%0aREMEDIES. %0a%0aLeuce, 23 a plant resembling mercurialis, 24 has received its %0a%0a15 Some kind of lichen, probably, but wbat in particular it is impossible %0ato say. 16 Ring-worm or tetter. %0a%0a17 ilardouin says that this herpetic disease is called “ cantharides,” be¬ %0acause it attacks the body as the cantharis attacks wheat. See B. xviii. c. 44. %0a%0a18 It would be superfluous to look for sense in this silly formula. %0a%0a19 Anguillara and C. Bauhin identify it with the Ranunculus thora of %0a%0aLinnaeus, and other authorities with the Doronicum pardaliancbes of Lin¬ %0anaeus. Pliny is the only writer that mentions it; and if it really had any %0aexistence, it would seem quite impossible, as Fee says, to identify it with %0acorrectness. 20 “ Venenum cervarium.” 21 See B. xxv. c. 25. %0a%0a22 “ Salivati.” Holland renders this, “ A mash wherewith they used to %0adrench cattle.” 23 Identified with the Lamium of B. xxii. c. 15. %0a%0a24 See B. xxv. c. 18. The resemblance, Fee says, is by no mean-* a %0astriking one. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 80.] %0a%0a%0aTHE MYOSOTA. %0a%0a%0a255 %0a%0a%0aname 24 from the circumstance that a white line runs through %0athe middle of the leaf; for which reason also, some give it the %0aname of “ mcsoleucon.” 26 The juice of this plant is curative of %0afistula, and the plant itself, bruised, is good for carcinomata. %0aIt is probably the same plant as that called “ leucas,” so %0aremarkably efficacious for the venom of all kinds of marine %0aanimals. Authors have not given a description of it, beyond %0atelling us that the wild leucas has larger leaves than the other, %0aand has properties more strongly developed: they state also %0athat the seed of the cultivated kind is the more acrid of the %0atwo. %0a%0aCHAP. 78. -THE LETJCOGRAPHIS : FIVE REMEDIES. %0a%0aI have not found a description given by any writer of the %0aleucographis; 27 a thing I am the more surprised at, as they tell %0aus that it is good for the cure of spitting of blood, taken in %0adoses of three oboli with saffron; as also that it is useful for %0acoeliac affections, applied beaten up in water, and in cases of %0aexcessive menstruation. They state also that it enters into %0athe composition of ophthalmic preparations, and that it fills up %0aulcers on the more tender parts of the body with new flesh. %0a%0aCHAP. 79. (12.)— THE MEDION : THKEE EEMEDIES. %0a%0aThe medion 28 has leaves like those of the cultivated seris, 29 %0aa stem three feet in length, and a large, round, purple flower, %0aat its extremity. The seed is diminutive, and the root half a %0afoot in length: it grows upon umbrageous, sheltered rocks. %0aThe root, taken in doses of two drachmae with honey, arrests %0athe catamenia, the electuary being used for some days. The %0aseed, too, is administered in wine for a similar purpose. %0a%0aCHAP. 80. -THE MYOSOTA OR MYOSOTIS : THREE REMEDIES. %0a%0aThe myosota 30 or myosotis is a smooth plant, throwing out %0a%0a24 The “white” plant. 26 “ White in the middle.” %0a%0a27 Identified by Fee with the Cerinthe of B. xxi. c. 41. Sprengel, how¬ %0aever, considers it to be the Carduus leucographus of Linnaeus. %0a%0a28 Fee identifies it with the Campanula Medium of Linmeus, our Canter¬ %0abury or Coventry bells ; but this flower is blue, while the colour of the %0aMedion is purple. Littre gives the Convolvulus althseoides of Linnaeus. %0aSibthorp has named the Campanula laciniata; and other authorities the %0aMichauxia campanuloi'des. %0a%0aM See B. xx. c: 32. %0a%0a10 “Mouse-ears.” Fee identifies it with the .Myosotis scorpioides of %0a%0a%0a256 %0a%0a%0apliny’s natural history. %0a%0a%0a[Book XXVII. %0a%0a%0afrom a single root numerous hollowed stems, of a somewhat %0areddish colour; and bearing at the lower extremities swarthy, %0anarrow, oblong leaves, sharp on the back, arranged in pairs %0aat regular distances, and springing from delicate branches %0aattached with axils to the main stems. The flower is blue, %0aand the root, a finger in length, is provided with numerous %0afilaments like hairs. This plant possesses certain septic and ul¬ %0acerating properties, and hence is used for the cure of fistula %0aof the eye. The Egyptians say that if upon the morning of %0athe twenty-eight day of their month Thoth, a day which gene¬ %0arally falls in our month of August, a person rubs himself with %0athe juice of this plant before speaking to any one, he will be %0asure to have no diseases of the eyes all that year. %0a%0aCHAP. 81. -THE MYAGROS: ONE REMEDY. %0a%0aThe myagros 31 is a ferulaceous plant, with leaves like those %0aof madder: the seed is of an oily nature—indeed, an oil is %0aextracted from it. Ulcerations of the mouth are cured by %0arubbing them with the juice of this plant. %0a%0aCHAP. 82. -THE NYMA : ONE REMEDY. %0a%0aThe plant called “ nyma” 32 bears three long leaves, like %0athose of eudive: applied to scars, it restores the Skin to its %0anatural colour. %0a%0aCHAP. 83. -THE NATRIX : ONE REMEDY. %0a%0a“ Matrix ” 33 is the name of a plant, the root of which, when %0ataken out of the ground, has just the rank smell of the he-goat. %0aIt is used in Picenum for the purpose of keeping away from %0afemales what with a singular credulity they call by the name %0aof “ Fatui.” 34 For my own part, however, I should think that %0a%0aLinnaeus, Scorpion-grass, or mouse-ear, which is not of a corrosive nature, as %0aPliny says, but emollient and soothing. Littre names the Asperugo pro- %0acumbens of Linnaeus, Wild bugloss, German madwort, or great goose-grass. %0a%0a31 Sprengel identifies it with the Alyssum sativum, the Garden madwort; %0aFee with the Camelina sativa of Crantz, the Cultivated cameline. Littre %0agives the Neslia paniculata as its synonym. %0a%0a32 Or “ Nigina,” in some editions. It is utterly unknown. %0a%0a33 Possibly a fabulous plant; though it is generally identified with the %0aOnonis natrix of Linnaeus. Poinsinet de Sivry derives its name from the %0aCelto-Germanic words, nat, “night,” and r«, “wand;” a name given to it, %0aaccording to him, for its efficacy in dispelling the illusions of the night. %0a%0a34 Or “ Fauni,” the same as our nightmare. %0a%0a%0aChap. 86.] %0a%0a%0aTHE ONOSMA. %0a%0a%0a257 %0a%0a%0apersons requiring to be treated with such medicaments as %0athese, must be labouring under a sort of mental hallucination. %0a%0aCHAP. 84. -ODONTITIS : ONE REMEDY. %0a%0aOdontitis 86 is a sort of hay-grass, 36 which throws out from a %0asingle root numerous, small, jointed stems, of a triangular form %0aand of a swarthy hue. At the joints there-are small leaves, %0asomewhat longer than those of the polygonos ; 37 and in the %0aaxils formed by these leaves is the seed, similar to barley in %0aappearance. It has a purple, diminutive flower, and is found %0agrowing in meadows. 38 A handful of the stems, boiled in %0aastringent wine, is used for the cure of tooth-ache, 39 the de¬ %0acoction being retained for some time in the mouth. %0a%0aCHAP. 85. -THE OTIIONNA : ONE REMEDY. %0a%0aThe othonna 40 is a Syrian plant, resembling rocket in ap¬ %0apearance ; its leaves are pierced with numerous holes, and its %0atlower resembles that of saffron, for which reason some persons %0ahave given it the name of “ anemone.” The juice of this %0aplant is employed in ophthalmic preparations; it is slightly %0apungent, of a warming nature, and astringent as it dries. It %0aacts us a detergent upon cicatrizations, films on the eyes, and %0aall impediments of the sight. Some say that the plant is %0awashed and dried, and then divided into lozenges. %0a%0aCHAP. 86.-THE ONOSMA : ONE PROPERTY. %0a%0aThe onosma 41 has leaves some four fingers in length, lying %0aupon the ground, and indented like those of the anchusa : 42 it %0ahas neither 43 stem, blossom, nor seed.

The juice of it, injected into the nostrils, %0aarrests haemorrhage : taken with wine, it has a similar effect %0aupon bleeding at any other part of the body, as also spitting %0aof blood. Those who distinguish several kinds of polygonos, %0amake this to be the male 54 plant, and say that it is so called %0afrom the large number of seeds, or else from its numerous %0abranches. Some call-it “ polygonatos,” 55 from the number of %0aits joints, others, again, “ teuthalis,” and others, “ carcine- %0athron,” “ clema,” or “ myrtopetalos.” %0a%0aThere are some authorities to be found, however, who say that %0athis is the female plant, and that the male is more diminutive, %0aless swarthy, and more jointed, with a seed protruding beneath %0aall the leaves. However this may be, these plants are of an %0aastringent, cooling nature. The seed is laxative, and, taken in %0alarge doses, acts as a diuretic, and arrests defluxions; indeed, %0aif there is no defluxion, it is of no use taking it. Tor burning %0aheats of the stomach, the leaves are applied topically ; and they %0aare used, in the form of a liniment, for pains in the bladder, and %0afor erysipelas. The juice is used as an injection for suppurations %0aof the ears, and by itself, for pains in the eyes. It is admi¬ %0anistered, also, in fevers, tertian and quartan fevers more par¬ %0aticularly, in doses of two cyathi, just before the paroxysms %0acome ou; as also in cases of cholera, dysentery, and derange¬ %0ament of the stomach. %0a%0aThere is a third kind, which grows on the mountains, and is %0aknown as “orios,” 66 similar to a delicate reed in appearance, and %0a%0a52 “ Many-seeded.” 53 “ Blood plant.” %0a%0a54 Identified by Fee with the Polygonum aviculare of Linnaeus, the %0aKnot-grass. %0a%0aw “Many-knotted.” Scribonius says that it received its name, “poly¬ %0agonos,” from its being found everywhere. %0a%0a56 Or “ mountain ” plant. Fee considers it to be the same as the %0asecond kind above mentioned, and to correspond with the female Polygonos %0aof Dioscorides. He identifies it with the Hippuris vulgaris of Linnaeus, %0a%0as 2 %0a%0a%0a260 %0a%0a%0aPLINY’S natural history. %0a%0a%0a[Book XXVII. %0a%0a%0ahaving but a single stem, with numerous joints running into %0aone another; the leaves of it are similar to those of the pitch- %0atree, and the root is never used. This variety, however, is not %0aso efficacious as those already mentioned, and, indeed, is used %0aexclusively for sciatica. A fourth kind is known as the wild 17 %0apolygonos : it is a shrub, almost a tree in fact, with a ligneous %0aroot, a red trunk like that of the cedar, and branches resem¬ %0abling those of spartum, 58 a couple of palms in length, and with %0athree or four dark-coloured, knotted joints. This kind, also, is %0aof an astringent nature, and has a flavour like that of the %0aquince. It is either boiled down in water to one third, or else %0adried and powdered for sprinkling upon ulceratioriB of the %0amouth and excoriations: it is chewed, also, for affections of %0athe gums. It arrests the progress of corrosive ulcers and of all %0asores of a serpiginous nature, or which cicatrize with difficulty, %0aand is particularly useful for ulcerations caused by Bnow. %0aHerbalists employ it also for quinzy, and use it as a chaplet for %0ahead-ache; for defluxions of the eyes, they put it round the %0aneck. %0a%0aIn cases of tertian fever, some persons pull it up wuth the %0aleft hand, and attach it as an amulet to the body; the same, %0atoo, in cases of haemorrhage. There is no plant that is more %0agenerally kept by them in a dry state than the polygonos. %0a%0achap. 92. —the pancratium: twelve remedies. %0a%0aThe pancratium is called by some the “little squill,” M in %0apreference : it has leaves like those of the white lily, but %0alonger and thicker, and a root composed of a large, red, bulb. %0aThe juice of it, taken with meal of fltches, relaxes the bowels, %0aand acts as a detergent upon ulcers : for dropsy, and diseases %0aof the spleen, it is administered with honey.

The leaves of it %0aresemble those of rue, but are a little larger; the seed, which %0alies beneath the leaves, is round, and smaller than that of the %0awhite poppy. It is ordinarily gathered in vineyards, at %0aharvest-time, and is dried with the seed on, receivers being %0aplaced beneath to catch it as it falls. This seed, taken in drink, %0apurges the bowels, and carries off bile andpituitous secretions: %0aone acetabulum, taken in three heminae of hydromel, is a %0amiddling dose. It is sprinkled also upon meat and other articles %0aof food, as a laxative medicine. %0a%0aCHAP. 94. —THE PE1UCLYMEN0S : FIVE REMEDIES. %0a%0aThe periclymenos 62 is also a shrub-like plant, with two %0awhitish, soft, leaves, arranged at intervals.

The seed %0ais dried in the shade, pounded, and divided into lozenges. %0aThese lozenges are left to dissolve, in three cyathi of white %0awine, fora period of thirty days, and are given for diseases of %0athe spleen ; the volume of which is gradually diminished either %0aby discharges of bloody urine, or else by alvine evacuation, %0athe effects of the medicament being perceptible at the end of %0aten days.

The leaves of it are small and %0around; the branches long, soft, thin, and flexible; and the %0ablossom elongated, and of a grass-green colour. The seed is %0anever used, but it has a pungent flavour and a powerful smell: %0athe plant is found growing upon moist, watery, elevations. %0aThe roots are two or three in number, some two cubits in %0alength, sinewy, white, and firm. It is dug up in autumn, and %0athe stem yields a juice like gum, when cut. The root is said %0ato be of wonderful efficacy as an application for the cure of %0awounds, more particularly of the sinews, even when severed. %0aA decoction of it is also taken, with honey, for relaxations of %0athe sinews, and for weakness or wounds of those parts. %0a%0a63 In B. xviii. c. 44. It was also called “ securidaca.” %0a%0a64 See B. xx. c. 71. %0a%0a65 We learn from Galen that it formed an ingredient in the great anti¬ %0adote of Mithridates. %0a%0a66 Fee thinks that it may possibly be the Polygala vulgaris of Linnaeus, the %0aCommon milk-wort.

The female %0aplant is of a more grass-green colour than the other, with a %0athin stem, a diminutive root, and a round seed, like that of the %0apoppy. This last kind ensures the conception of issue of the %0asame sex; Yvhile the male plant, differing only in the seed, %0awhich resembles the olive at its first appearance, ensures the %0aconception of male issue.

Applied topically, it reduces %0aabscesses and inflammations, and heals wounds: used with %0araisin wine, it allays defluxions of the eyes; with honey, ecchy- %0amosis; and with vinegar, livid marks upon the skin. Reduced %0ato powder, it is sprinkled upon malignant ulcers, and is given %0ainternally for spitting of hlood, in doses of one drachma, in %0awater. For dysentery and coeliac affections, if unattended %0awith fever, it is administered in wine; but if there is fever, in %0awater. It is pounded more easily when it has been steeped in %0awater the night before. A decoction of it is given, in doses %0aof two drachmae, for ruptures, convulsions, contusions, and falls %0awith violence. %0a%0aIn cases of pains in the chest, a little pepper and myrrh is %0aadded.

Its medicinal properties %0aare warming and resolvent. %0a%0aThe leaves and root are used as a diuretic and as an emmen- %0aagogue ; the seed arrests diarrhoea; and the root, applied topi¬ %0acally, disperses abscesses and suppurations, provided they are %0anot inveterate, and reduces indurated tumours. It is useful, %0aalso, for injuries inflicted by the phalangium and by serpents, %0ataken in wine, with the addition of cachrys, 95 polium, 96 or me- %0alissophyllum ; 91 the dose, however, must be taken a little at a %0atime only, for otherwise it acts as an emetic, a reason for which %0ait is sometimes administered with rue. The seed or root is %0acurative of cough, hardness of breathing, and diseases of the %0athoracic organs, spleen, kidneys, and bladder; the root, too, is %0aused for ruptures and convulsions. This plant facilitates %0adelivery, and brings away the afterbirth; it is also given, iu %0acombination with crethmos, 98 in wine, for sciatica. It acts as a %0asudorific and carminative, for which reason it is used to disperse %0aflatulency of the stomach ; it promotes, also, the cicatrization %0aof wounds. %0a%0aA juice is extracted from the root, which is very useful for %0afemale complaints, and for affections of the thoracic organs %0aand viscera, possessing, as it does, certain calorific, digestive, %0aand detergent properties. The seed, in particular, is given in %0adrink for dropsy, external applications being made of the %0ajuice, and emollient poultices applied of the dried rind of the %0aroot. It is used, also, as a seasoning for food, boiled meat in %0aparticular, with the addition of honied wine, oil, and garum." %0a%0aSinon, 1 a plant with a flavour very like that of pepper, pro¬ %0amotes the digestion, and is highly efficacious for pains in the %0astomach. %0a%0a%0aCHAP. 110. -TELEPHION : FOUR REMEDIES. %0a%0aTelephion 2 resembles purslain in the stem and leaves.

It is used as an application %0afor freckles, being removed as soon as dry; it is employed, %0aalso, for white morphew,' 1 being applied some six hours each %0anight or day, and the treatment continued for about three %0amonths: after removing it, barley-meal should be applied. %0aTelephion is healing, also, for wounds and fistulas. %0a%0aCHAP. 111.-THE TKICHOMANES : FIVE REMEDIE9. %0a%0aThe trichomanes 4 is a plant that resembles the adiautum,‘ex¬ %0acept that it is more slender and of a darker colour; the leaves %0aof it, which are similar to those of the lentil, lie close together, %0aon opposite sides, and have a bitter taste. A decoction of this %0aplant, taken in white wine, with the addition of wild cummin, %0ais curative of strangury. Bruised and applied to the head, it %0aprevents the hair from falling off, and, where it has come off, %0arestores it: pounded and applied with oil, it effects the cure %0aof alopecy. The mere taste of it is provocative of sneezing. %0a%0aCHAP. 112.-THE THALICTRUM : ONE REMEDY. %0a%0aThe thalictrum® has leaves like those of coriander, only %0asomewhat more unctuous, and a stem resembling that of the %0apoppy. 7 It is found growing everywhere, in champaign locali¬ %0aties more particularly. The leaves, applied with honey, heal %0aulcers. %0a%0aCHAP. 113.-THLASPI AND PERSICON NAPY : FOUR REMEDIES. %0a%0aOf thlaspi there are two kinds ; the first 8 of which has nar¬ %0arow leaves, about a finger in length and breadth, turned to- %0a%0agreen orpine ; and by Littr6 with the Cerinthe aspera, the Prickly honey- %0awort. 3 Vitiligini.” %0a%0a4 The same plant as the Callitrichos of B. xxv. c. 86. %0a%0a6 See B. xxii. c. 30. %0a%0a6 Identified by Fee and Desfontaines with the Thalictrum minus of %0aLinnaeus, the Small meadow rue.

It has a slender %0astem, half a foot in length, and not wholly destitute of %0abranches; the seed, enclosed in a crescent-shaped capsule, 9 is %0asimilar to a lentil in shape, except that it has a jagged %0aappearance, to which, in fact, it owes its name ; 10 the flower is %0awhite, and the plant is found near footpaths and in hedges. %0aThe seed, which has an acrid flavour, carries off bile and %0apituitou8 secretions, by vomit and by alvine evacuation, the %0aproper dose being one acetabulum. It is used, also, for sciatica, %0ain the form of an injection, this treatment being persevered in %0auntil it has induced a discharge of blood : it acts also as an %0aeinnienagogue, but is fatal to the foetus. %0a%0aThe other thlaspi, known by some as “ Persicon napy,” 11 has %0abroad leaves and large roots, and is also very useful as an %0ainjection for sciatica. Both plants are very serviceable for in¬ %0aguinal complaints ; it being recommended that the person who %0agathers them should mention that he is taking them for diseases %0aof the groin, for abscesses of all kinds, and for wounds, and %0athat he should pluck them with one hand only. %0a%0aCHAP. 114. - THE TRACniNIA ! ONE PROPERTY. %0a%0aWhat sort of plant the trachinia 12 is, the authorities do not %0astate. I think that the assurance given by Democritus must %0abe false: for it would be nothing less than a prodigy, for a %0aplant, attached as an amulet, to consume the spleen in so short %0au time as three days. %0a%0aCRAP. 115. —THE TRAGONIS OR TUAGION : FOUR REMEDIES. %0a%0aThe tragonis, 13 or tragion, grows nowhere but in the mari¬ %0atime districts of the Isle of Crete ; it resembles the juniper in %0a%0a9 “ Peltarum specie.” The “ pelta ” was a small, light shield, of %0avarious forms, hut most commonly, perhaps, that of a crescent. %0a%0alu From 6\du>, “ to break.” %0a%0a11 “ Persian mustard.” The Lunaria annua of Linnaeus, the Annual %0amoon-wort, honesty, or satin-flower, has been suggested by Sprengel, but %0aits identity is very doubtful. %0a%0au This plant is unknown. A rose of this name is mentioned in R. xxi. %0a%0ac. 10. %0a%0a13 See B. xiii. c. 36.

It increases the milk in nursing women, and is a %0asovereign remedy for diseases of the mamillae. %0a%0aCHAP. 116. -THE TKAGOS OR SCORPION : FOUR REMEDIES. %0a%0aThere is another plant also, called “tragos,” 11 or “scorpion” %0aby some, half a foot in height, branchy, destitute of leaves, %0aand bearing diminutive red clusters, with a seed like that of %0awheat, but pointed at the extremity : this too grows in mari¬ %0atime localities. Ten or twelve tops of the branches, bruised %0aand taken in wane, are remedial in cases of coeliac affections, %0adysentery, spitting of blood, and excessive menstruation. %0a%0aCHAP. 117. —THE TRAGOPOGON OR COME. %0a%0aThere is the tragopogon, 16 also, by some called “ comea %0aplant with a small stem, leaves like those of saffron, an elon¬ %0agated, sweet, root, and a large, swarthy calyx at the extremity %0aof the stem. It grows in rugged soils, and is never used. %0a%0aCHAP. 118.-THE AGES OF PLANTS. %0a%0aSuch, then, is all that I have hitherto been enabled to %0alearn or discover, worthy of mention, relative to plants. At %0athe close of this subject, it seems to me that it will not be out %0aof place to remind the reader, that the properties of plants %0avary according to their age. It is elaterium, as already %0astated,' 6 that preserves its properties the longest of all. The %0ablack chamseleon 16 * retains its virtues forty years, centaury not %0amore than twelve, peucedanum 17 and aristolochia 18 six, and %0athe wild vine one year—that is to say, if they are kept in the %0ashade. I would remark, also, that beyond those animals which %0abreed within the plants, there are none that attack the roots %0a%0a11 See B. xiii. c. 37. M.

The efficacy, too, of all plants is impaired %0aby making habitual use of them ; and these substances, if em¬ %0aployed daily, lose equally their good or bad properties, when %0arequired to be effectual. All plants, too, have more powerful %0aproperties, when grown in soils that are cold and exposed to %0athe north-eastern blasts, or in dry localities. %0a%0aCHAP. 120. -MALADIES PECULIAR TO VARIOUS NATIONS. %0a%0aThere are certain differences, also, by no means inconsider¬ %0aable, in the predispositions of the various nations of the earth. %0aI have been informed, for instance, that the people of Egypt, %0aArabia, Syria, and Cilicia, are subject to tapeworm and maw- %0aworm, while those of Thracia and Phrygia, on the other hand, %0aare totally exempt from them. This, however, is less sur¬ %0aprising than the fact that, although Attica and Boeotia are %0aadjoining territories, the Thebans are troubled with these %0ainflictions, while among the people of Athens they are un¬ %0aknown. %0a%0aConsiderations of this description lead me now to turn my %0aattention to the nature of the animated beings themselves, and %0athe medicinal properties which are inborn in them, the most %0aassured remedies, perhaps, for all diseases. %0a%0aFor Nature, in fact, that parent of all things, has produced no %0aanimated being for the purpose solely of eating ; she has willed %0athat it should be born to satisfy the wants of others, and in %0aits very vitals has implanted medicaments conducive to health. %0aWhile she has implanted them in mute 21 and inanimate %0aobjects even, she has equally willed that these, the most in- %0a%0a19 A kind of foetid beetle, Hardouin says.

Dr. Yates is of opinion that Pliny has here %0amistranslated a passage of Aristotle, Hist. Anim. v. 19, and that he has %0amistaken the word (3onf3vicia , “cocoons,” for webs, similar to those of %0athe spider, attached to the leaves of trees. Not understanding the original, %0ahe would seem to have given a distorted account of the simple operation %0aof winding the threads from off the cocoons of the silkworm upon bobbins, %0aby the bands of females ; the threads upon which bobbins would be after¬ %0awards unwound for the manufacture of silken fabrics. See Notes 8 and 9 %0aon the passage in question; also B. xi. c. 26. %0a%0aB. viii. c. 74 [V. ii. p. 336]. For the word “ Sororiculata,” Dr. Yates %0aproposes to read “ Soriculata,” and he suggests that the cloth thus called %0amay have been a velvet or plush, which received its name from its resem¬ %0ablance to the coat of the field-mouse, “sorex,” the diminutive of which %0awould be “ soricula.” %0a%0aB. xix. c. 2 [Y. iv. p. 133] and c. 6 [p. 138]. Dr. Yates expresses it %0aas bis opinion that the words “Carbasus” and “Carbasa” are derived from %0athe oriental word Carpets, signifying “cotton,” and thinks that Pliny, in %0aB. xix. c. 2, may have used the word by Catachresis, as meaning linen, in %0athe same manner as the Latin poets repeatedly use the word “ carbasa,” %0a** signifying various kinds of woven textures. If this view be correct, %0athe word “Carbasina” in B. xix. c. 6, will probably mean “awnings of %0a%0a%0a4fl %0a%0aSee %0a%0aend %0a%0aof %0a%0aB. %0a%0aXX. %0a%0a49 %0a%0aSee %0a%0aend %0a%0a61 %0a%0aSec %0a%0aend %0a%0aof %0a%0aB. %0a%0aXX. %0a%0a52 %0a%0aSee %0a%0aend %0a%0a64 %0a%0aSee %0a%0aend %0a%0aof %0a%0aB. %0a%0aXX. %0a%0a55 %0a%0aSee %0a%0aend %0a%0a67 %0a%0aSee %0a%0aend %0a%0aof %0a%0aB. %0a%0aXX. %0a%0a59 %0a%0aSee %0a%0aend %0a%0a60 %0a%0aSee %0a%0aend %0a%0aof %0a%0aB. %0a%0axii. %0a%0a61 %0a%0aSee %0a%0aend %0a%0a63 %0a%0aSee %0a%0aend %0a%0aof %0a%0aB. %0a%0aXX. %0a%0a64 %0a%0aSee %0a%0aend %0a%0a(6 %0a%0aSee %0a%0aend %0a%0aof %0a%0aB. %0a%0aXX. %0a%0a67 %0a%0aSee %0a%0aend %0a%0a*9 %0a%0aSee %0a%0aend %0a%0aof %0a%0aB. %0a%0aXX. %0a%0a70 %0a%0aSee %0a%0aend %0a%0a71 %0a%0aSee %0a%0aend %0a%0aof %0a%0aB. %0a%0aXX. %0a%0a73 %0a%0aSee %0a%0aend %0a%0aVOL. %0a%0aV. %0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0aof %0a%0aB. %0a%0aXX. %0a%0a50 %0a%0aSee %0a%0aend %0a%0aof %0a%0aB. %0a%0aXX, %0a%0aof %0a%0aB. %0a%0aXX. %0a%0a53 %0a%0aSee %0a%0aend %0a%0aof %0a%0aB. %0a%0aXX. %0a%0aof %0a%0aB. %0a%0avii. %0a%0a56 %0a%0aSee %0a%0aend %0a%0aof %0a%0aB. %0a%0aXX. %0a%0aof %0a%0aB. %0a%0axii. %0a%0a59 %0a%0aSee %0a%0aend %0a%0aof %0a%0aB. %0a%0axi. %0a%0aof %0a%0aB. %0a%0aXX. %0a%0a62 %0a%0aSee %0a%0aend %0a%0aof %0a%0aB. %0a%0axii. %0a%0aof %0a%0aB. %0a%0aXX. %0a%0a65 %0a%0aSee %0a%0aend %0a%0aof %0a%0aB. %0a%0aXX. %0a%0aof %0a%0aB. %0a%0aXX. %0a%0a68 %0a%0aSee %0a%0aend %0a%0aof %0a%0aB. %0a%0axii. %0a%0aof %0a%0aB. %0a%0aXX. %0a%0a71 %0a%0aSee %0a%0aend %0a%0aof %0a%0aB. %0a%0axxi. %0a%0aof %0a%0aB. %0a%0aXX. %0a%0a74 %0a%0aSee %0a%0aend %0a%0aof %0a%0aB. %0a%0aXX. %0a%0a%0aT %0a%0a%0a[Cook XXVII. %0a%0a%0a274 pliny’s natural history. %0a%0awoven material " generally, and not of fine linen, or cambric, as suggested %0ain Note 55. %0a%0aB. xix. c. 2 [Y. iv. p. 134]. The genuineness of the passage which %0amakes mention of the “ Gossypium,” is questioned by Dr. lutes, who %0athinks it possible that it is an interpolation: such, however, if we may %0ajudge from the result of Sillig’s researches, does not appear to have been %0athe case. If, on the other hand, the passage is genuine, Dr. Yates is of %0aopinion that the statement is incorrect, and that cotton was not grown in %0aEgypt. It seems just possible, however, that Pliny may have had in view %0athe trees mentioned by him in B. xiv. c. 28. %0a%0aB. xix. c. 4 [V. iv. p. 137, also p. 134, Note 37]. Dr. Yates has ad¬ %0aduced a number of convincing arguments to prove that the “ Byssus " of %0athe ancients cannot have been cotton, but that in all probability it was a %0atexture of fine flax. The passages of Pausanias, (B. v. c. 25, and B. vi. %0ac. 26) in which “Byssus” is mentioned, would certainly seem to apply %0ato flax, a product which is still cultivated near the mouth of the river %0aPeneus, in ancient Elis. There is no doubt, however, that Philostratus, %0athough perhaps erroneously, has used the word “ Byssus ” as meaning %0acotton.

(1.)—BESEABCHES OF THE ANCIENTS UPON THIS %0a%3c SUBJECT. %0a%3c %0a%3c The farther I proceed in this work, the more I am impressed %0a%3c with admiration of the ancients ; and the greater the number %0a%3c of plants that remain to be described, the more I am induced %0a%3c to venerate the zeal displayed by the men of former times in %0a%3c their researches, and the kindly spirit manifested by them in %0a%3c transmitting to us the results thereof. Indeed their bounteous¬ %0a%3c ness in this respect would almost seem to have surpassed the %0a%3c munificent disposition even of Nature herself, if our knowledge %0a%3c of plants had depended solely upon man’s spirit of discovery : %0a%3c but as it is, it is evident beyond all doubt that this knowledge %0a%3c has emanated from the gods themselves, or, at all events, has %0a%3c been the result of divine inspiration, even in those cases where %0a%3c man has been instrumental in communicating it to us. In %0a%3c other words, if we must confess the truth—a marvel surpassed %0a%3c by nothing in our daily experience—Nature herself, that %0a%3c common parent of all things, has at once produced them, and %0a%3c has discovered to us their properties. %0a%3c %0a%3c Wondrous indeed is it, that a Scythian 1 plant should he %0a%3c brought from the shores of the Palus Maeotis, and the euphor¬ %0a%3c bia 2 from Mount Atlas and the regions beyond the Pillars of %0a%3c Hercules, localities where the operations of Nature have reached %0a%3c their utmost limit ! That in another direction, the plant %0a%3c britannica 2 * should he conveyed to us from isles of the %0a%3c Ocean situate beyond the confines of the earth ! 3 That the %0a%3c ffithiopis 1 should reach us from a climate scorched by the %0a%3c %0a%3c 1 He alludes to the Glycyrrhiza or Scythice, our Liquorice, which is %0a%3c still found on the hanks of the river Volga.

(2.)—ACONITE, OTHEBW18E CALLED THELYPHONON, CAM- %0a%3c MABON, PABD ALI AN CUES, OB SCOBPIO ; FOUB BEMEDIES. %0a%3c %0a%3c But who, I say, can sufficiently venerate the zeal and spirit of %0a%3c research displayed by the ancients ? It is they who have shown %0a%3c us that aconite is the most prompt of all poisons in its effects %0a%3c —so much so indeed, that female animals, if the sexual parts* %0a%3c are but touched with it, will not survive a single day. With %0a%3c this poison it was that M. Caecilius 6 accused Calpurnius Bestia %0a%3c of killing his wives in their sleep, and this it was that gave %0a%3c rise to that fearful peroration of his, denouncing the murderous %0a%3c finger of the accused. 7 According to the fables of mythology, %0a%3c this plant was originally produced from the foam of the dog %0a%3c Cerberus, when dragged by Hercules from the Infernal 8 Re¬ %0a%3c gions ; for which reason, it is said, it is still so remarkably %0a%3c abundant in the vicinity of Heraclea in Pontus, a spot where %0a%3c the entrance is still pointed out to the shades below. %0a%3c %0a%3c And yet, noxious as it is, the ancients have shown us how to %0a%3c employ aconite for the benefit of mankind, and have taught us %0a%3c as the result of their experience, that, taken in mulled wine, %0a%3c it neutralizes the venom of the scorpion : indeed such is the %0a%3c nature of this deadly plant, that it kills man, unless it can find %0a%3c %0a%3c 5 See B. xxv. c. 75. %0a%3c %0a%3c 6 Properly “ Caelius ”—the same M. Caelius Rufus who is mentioned %0a%3c in B. vii. c. 50. See also B. xxxv. c. 46. %0a%3c %0a%3c 7 “ Hinc ilia atrox peroratio ejus in digitum.” Sillig is probably right %0a%3c %0a%3c in his suggestion that the word “ mortiferum ” is wanting at the end of %0a%3c the sentence. Bestia was accused of having killed his wives by the %0a%3c contact of aconite, applied, through the agency of the finger, to the secret %0a%3c parts. 8 See B. vi. c. i. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 2.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ACONITE. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 219 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c in man something else to kill. When such is the case, as %0a%3c though it had discovered in the body a fit rival to contend with, %0a%3c that substance is the sole object of its attack ; finding another %0a%3c poison in the viscera, to it alone it confines its onslaught; %0a%3c and thus, a truly marvellous thing ! two poisons, each of them %0a%3c of a deadly nature, destroy one another within the body, and %0a%3c the man survives. Even more than this, the ancients have %0a%3c handed down to us remedies employed by the animals them¬ %0a%3c selves, and have shown how that venomous creatures even effect %0a%3c their own cure. By the contact of aconite the scorpion is %0a%3c struck with torpor, 9 is quite benumbed, assumes a pallid hue, %0a%3c and so confesses itself vanquished. When this is the case, %0a%3c white hellebore is its great auxiliary: the very touch of it dis- %0a%3c pels its torpor, and the aconite is forced to yield before two %0a%3c foes, its own enemy 10 and the common 11 enemy of all. %0a%3c %0a%3c Now, after this, if any one should be of opinion that man %0a%3c could, by any chance or possibility, make such discoveries as %0a%3c these, he must surely be guilty of ingratitude in thus appre¬ %0a%3c ciating the beneficence of the gods! In countries frequented %0a%3c by the panther, they rub meat with aconite, and if one of %0a%3c those animals should but taste it, its effects are fatal: indeed %0a%3c were not these means adopted, the country would soon be over¬ %0a%3c run by them. It is for this reason, too, that some persons %0a%3c have given to hellebore the name of “ pardalianches.” 12 It has %0a%3c been well ascertained, however, that the panther instantaneously %0a%3c recovers if it can find the opportunity of eating human ordure. 13 %0a%3c So far as these animals are concerned, who can entertain a %0a%3c doubt that it was chance only that first led them to this dis¬ %0a%3c covery ; and that as often as this happens the discovery is only %0a%3c a mere repetition of the accident, there being neither reason %0a%3c nor an appreciation of experience to ensure its transmission %0a%3c among them ? %0a%3c %0a%3c (3.) It is chance, 14 yes, it is chance that is the Deity who %0a%3c has made to us these numerous revelations for our practical %0a%3c %0a%3c * See B. xxv. c. 75. %0a%3c %0a%3c 10 The hellebore.

[Book XXVII. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c benefit ; 15 always understanding that under this name we mean %0a%3c Nature, that great parent and mistress of all things : and this %0a%3c is evident, whether we come to the conclusion, that these wild %0a%3c beasts make the discovery from day to day, or that they are %0a%3c gifted from the first with these powers of perception. Re. %0a%3c garded in another point of view, it really is a disgrace that %0a%3c all animated beings should have an exact knowledge of what %0a%3c is beneficial to them, with the exception of man ! %0a%3c %0a%3c The ancients, openly professing their belief that there is no %0a%3c evil without some admixture of good, have asserted that aconite %0a%3c is a remarkably useful ingredient in compositions for the eyes. %0a%3c It may therefore be permitted me, though I have hitherto %0a%3c omitted a description of the poisonous plants, to point out the %0a%3c characteristics of aconite, if only that it may be the more %0a%3c easily detected. Aconite 16 has leaves like those of cyclaminos 1 ’ %0a%3c or of the cucumber, never more than four in number, slightly %0a%3c hairy, and rising from near the root. This root, which is of %0a%3c moderate size, resembles the sea-fish known as the “cam- %0a%3c marus,” 18 a circumstance owing to which the plant has received %0a%3c the name of “ cammaron ” from some; while others, for the %0a%3c reason already 19 mentioned, have called it “ thelyphonon.’’ M %0a%3c The root is slightly curved, like a scorpion’s tail, for which %0a%3c reason some persons have given it the name of “scorpio.” %0a%3c Others, again, have preferred giving it the name of “ myoc- %0a%3c tonon,” 21 from the fact that the odour of it kills mice at a %0a%3c considerable distance even. %0a%3c %0a%3c This plant is found growing upon the naked rocks known %0a%3c as “ aconae ;” 22 and hence it is, according to some authorities, %0a%3c %0a%3c 15 “ Hoc habet nomen ” is omitted ; for, as Sillig says, it is evidently a %0a%3c gloss, which has crept into the text. %0a%3c %0a%3c 16 The ancients no doubt knew several plants under the common name %0a%3c of Aconitum. The one here described, is identified by Fee with the Do- %0a%3c ronicum pardalianches of Linnaeus, Leopard’s bane. %0a%3c %0a%3c 11 See B. xxv. c. 67. Fee says that neither the leaves of the Doronicum, %0a%3c nor of any plant of the genus Arnica, bear any resemblance to those of %0a%3c the Cyclamen, or the cucumber. He remarks also, that the contact solely %0a%3c of it is not productive of poisonous effects. %0a%3c %0a%3c 18 A kind of crab. 19 At the beginning of this Chapter. %0a%3c %0a%3c 20 “ Female-bane,” or “ female-killer.” See B. xx. c. 23. %0a%3c %0a%3c 21 “ Mice-killer.” This assertion is incorrect. %0a%3c %0a%3c 22 So called from a, “without,” and koviq, “dust.” Theophrastus %0a%3c says that it received its name from the town of Aeon®, in the vicinity of %0a%3c which it grew in great abundance. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 4.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c AGERATON. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 221 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c that it is called “ aconitum,” there being not so much as dust %0a%3c even about it to conduce to its nutriment. Such is the reason %0a%3c given for its name by some : but according to others, it re¬ %0a%3c ceives this appellation from the fact that it fatally exercises the %0a%3c same effects upon the body that the whetstone 23 does upon the %0a%3c edge of iron, being no sooner employed than its effects are felt. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 3. (4.)- A5TH10PIS I FOUR REMEDIES. %0a%3c %0a%3c .Ethiopis 24 is a plant with leaves resembling those of phlo- %0a%3c mos,“ large, numerous, hairy, and springing from the root. %0a%3c The stem is square, rough, similar to that of arction 35 * in ap¬ %0a%3c pearance, and with numerous axillary concavities. The seed %0a%3c resembles that of the fitch, being white and twofold ; the roots %0a%3c are several in number, long, fleshy, soft, and of a viscous taste ; %0a%3c when dry they turn black and hard, and might easily be taken %0a%3c for horns. In addition to ^Ethiopia, this plant grows upon %0a%3c Mount Ida in Troas, and in Messenia. The roots are gathered %0a%3c in autumn, and left to dry for some days in the sun, to prevent %0a%3c them from turning mouldy. Taken in white wine they are %0a%3c curative of affections of the uterus, and a decoction of them %0a%3c is administered for sciatica, pleurisy, and eruptions of the %0a%3c throat. The kind, however, which comes from ^Ethiopia, is %0a%3c by far the best, and gives instantaneous relief. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 4. -AGERATON : FOUR REMEDIES. %0a%3c %0a%3c Ageraton 26 is a ferulaceous plant, a couple of palms in height, %0a%3c similar to origanum 27 in appearance, and bearing flowers like %0a%3c balls of gold. Used as a fumigation, this plant acts as a %0a%3c diuretic; and as a detergent upon the uterus, when used in a %0a%3c . sitting bath more particularly. Its name has been given to it, %0a%3c from the circumstance that it keeps a very long time without %0a%3c fading. %0a%3c %0a%3c 25 Also called cikovt]. %0a%3c %0a%3c 21 Generally identified with the Salvia argentea of Linnaeus, Silver sage, %0a%3c or else with the Salvia JEthiopis, Woolly sage. It must not be confounded %0a%3c with the plant of the same name mentioned in B. xxiv. c. 102. %0a%3c %0a%3c 24 See B. xxv. c. 73. %0a%3c %0a%3c :i * See c. 16 of this Book. %0a%3c %0a%3c 26 “Not growing old.’’ It is identified by Fee and Desfontaines with %0a%3c %0a%3c the Acbillaea ageratum of Linnaeus, Sweet milfoil or Maudlin.

The stem is tender, red in the middle, and not %0a%3c unlike that of the anthericus. 29 It has a single root, which runs %0a%3c straight downwards, like a stake driven into the ground; its %0a%3c smell is powerful, and it has a bitter taste. The most esteemed %0a%3c aloes are those imported from India, but it grows in the Asiatic %0a%3c provinces 30 as well. This last kind, however, is never used, %0a%3c except that the leaves are applied fresh to wounds; indeed, %0a%3c these leaves, as well as the juice, are glutinous to a marvellous %0a%3c degree, and it is for this property that it is grown in vessels of %0a%3c a conical form, in the same way as the greater aizoiim. 31 Some %0a%3c persons make incisions in the stem to obtain the j uice, before %0a%3c the 6eed is ripe, while others, again, make them in the leaves %0a%3c as well. Tearlike drops are also found adhering to it, which %0a%3c exude spontaneously: hence it is that some recommend that %0a%3c the place should be paved where it is grown, to prevent this %0a%3c juice from being absorbed. %0a%3c %0a%3c Some authors have stated, that there is found in Judaea, %0a%3c beyond Hierosolyma, a mineral 32 aloe, but that it is inferior to %0a%3c the other kinds, being of a darker colour and more humid than %0a%3c any of the rest. Aloes 53 of the finest quality should be %0a%3c unctuous and shining, of a red colour, brittle, compact, like %0a%3c the substance of liver, and easily liquefied. That which is %0a%3c hard and black should be rejected; the same, too, when it is %0a%3c mixed with sand or adulterated with gum and acacia, a fraud %0a%3c which may be easily detected by the taste. %0a%3c %0a%3c This plant is of an astringent nature, binding, and slightly %0a%3c calorific. It is employed for numerous purposes, but principally %0a%3c as a purgative, 34 it being almost the only one of all the medica- %0a%3c %0a%3c 28 The ancients probably included under this name several distinct species %0a%3c of the aloe. They were well acquainted, Fee says, with the Indian aloe, %0a%3c but probably not with that of Africa. As described by Pliny, he identifies %0a%3c it with the Aloe perfoliata of Linnaeus: Desfontaines gives the Aloe %0a%3c umbellata. 29 See B. xxi. c. 68. 30 “ Asia." %0a%3c %0a%3c 31 See B. xxv. c. 102. The aloe is still grown in large wooden vessels, %0a%3c in this country, at least; but only as an ornament. %0a%3c %0a%3c 32 He alludes to the bitumen of Judaea, much used by the Egyptians for %0a%3c the purposes of embalmment. %0a%3c %0a%3c 33 He is speaking of the prepared aloes of commerce. %0a%3c %0a%3c 31 It is still used for this purpose. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 5.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c THE ALOE. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 223 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c raents which produce that effect, that is at the same time a %0a%3c good stomachic, and does not exercise the slightest noxious %0a%3c influence upon the stomach. It is taken in doses of one %0a%3c drachma, and, in cases of derangement of the stomach, it is %0a%3c administered two or three times a day, in the proportion of %0a%3c one spoonful to two cyathi of warm or cold water, at intervals, %0a%3c according to the nature of the emergency. As a purgative it %0a%3c is mostly taken in doses of three drachmae; and it operates %0a%3c still more efficaciously, if food is eaten directly afterwards. %0a%3c Used with astringent wine, it prevents 35 the hair from falling %0a%3c off, the head being rubbed with it the contrary way of the %0a%3c hair, in the sun. Applied to the temples and forehead with %0a%3c rose oil and vinegar, or used as an infusion, in a more diluted %0a%3c form, it allays head-ache. It is generally agreed that it is %0a%3c remedial for all diseases 36 of the eyes, but more particularly for %0a%3c prurigo and scaly eruptions of the eye-lids ; as also for marks %0a%3c and bruises, applied in combination with honey, Pontic honey %0a%3c in particular. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is employed,also, for affections of the tonsillary glands and %0a%3c gums, for all ulcerations of the mouth, and for spitting of %0a%3c blood, if not in excess—the proper dose being one drachma, %0a%3c taken in water or else vinegar. Used by itself, or in combination %0a%3c with vinegar, it arrests haemorrhage, whether proceeding from %0a%3c wounds or from other causes. In addition to these properties, it %0a%3c is extremely efficacious for the cure of wounds, producing %0a%3c cicatrization very rapidly : it is sprinkled also upon ulcerations %0a%3c of the male organs, and is applied to condylomata and chaps %0a%3c oi the fundament, either in common wine, raisin wine, or by %0a%3c itself in a dry state, according as a mollifying or restrictive %0a%3c treatment is required. It has the effect, also, of gently %0a%3c arresting haemorrhoidal bleeding, when in excess. In cases of %0a%3c dysentery, it is used as an injection, and where the digestion %0a%3c is imperfect it is taken shortly after the evening meal. For %0a%3c jaundice, it is administered in doses of three oboli, in %0a%3c water. As a purgative for the bowels, it is taken in pills, with %0a%3c boiled honey or turpentine. It is good also for the removal of %0a%3c hangnails. When employed in ophthalmic preparations, it is %0a%3c first washed, that the more gravelly portions of it may subside; %0a%3c %0a%3c M There is no foundation, Fee says, for this statement. %0a%3c %0a%3c M It would appear that it is still employed in India for this purpose, %0a%3c but it is no longer used in Europe. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 224 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c plint’s natural history. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XXVII. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c or else it is put over the fire in a pipkin, and stirred with a %0a%3c feather from time to time, that the w hole of it may be equally %0a%3c warmed. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAT. 6.—ALCEA : ONE REMEDY. %0a%3c %0a%3c Alcea 37 is a plant with leaves, resembling those of vervain," %0a%3c known also as “ peristereon,” some three or four stems %0a%3c covered with leaves, a flower like that of the rose, and white %0a%3c roots, at most six in number, a cubit in length, and running %0a%3c obliquely.

When it first puts forth, the leaves %0a%3c bear a strong resemblance to the ears of mice. We shall have %0a%3c %0a%3c 37 Identified by Fee with the Malva alcea of Linnaeus, the Vervain %0a%3c mallow, an emollient and, comparatively, inert plant. Littre gives as %0a%3c its synonym the Malope malacho'ides, Marsh mallow. Sibthorp identifies %0a%3c it with the Hibiscus trionum, and Anguillara with the Althaea canryibina %0a%3c of Linnaeus. It is probably the same plant as the Alcima, mentioned several %0a%3c times in B. xxvi. 38 See B. xxv. c. 59. %0a%3c %0a%3c 39 Identified with the Globularia alypum of Linnaeus, the Three-toothed %0a%3c leaf Globularia, or Turbith. %0a%3c %0a%3c 40 Identified by Sprengel with the Cerastium aquaticum, and by other %0a%3c %0a%3c authorities with the Alsine media of Linnaeus, the Common chickweed. %0a%3c Desfontaines suggests the Stellaria nemorum, the Broadleaved stitchwort, %0a%3c but Fee prefers the Parietaria Cretica of Linnaeus, Cretan pellitory, as its %0a%3c synonym. 41 “ Mouse-ear.” %0a%3c %0a%3c 42 From the Greek akooc, a “ grove.” %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 10.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ANDEOSAMON. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 225 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c occasion, 43 however, to speak of another plant, which may, %0a%3c with much more justice, be called “ myosotis.” As for alsine, it %0a%3c would be the same thing as helxine, 44 were it not that it is smaller %0a%3c and not so hairy. It grows in 45 gardens, and upon walls more %0a%3c particularly : when rubbed, it emits a smell like that of cucum¬ %0a%3c ber. It is used for abscesses, inflammations, and all those pur¬ %0a%3c poses for which helxine is employed ; its properties, however, %0a%3c are not so active. It is applied topically, also, to defluxions of %0a%3c the eyes, and to sores upon the generative organs, and ulcera¬ %0a%3c tions, with barley meal. The juice is used as an injection for %0a%3c the ears. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 9.-THE ANDKOSACES : SIX REMEDIES. %0a%3c %0a%3c The androsaces 46 is a white plant, bitter, without leaves, and %0a%3c bearing arms surmounted with follicules, containing the seed. %0a%3c It grows in the maritime parts of Syria, more particularly. %0a%3c This plant is administered for dropsy, in doses of two drachmae, %0a%3c pounded or boiled, in either -water, wine, or vinegar: it acts %0a%3c most powerfully as a diuretic.

THREE REMEDIES. %0a%3c %0a%3c Ambrosia is a vague name, which has fluctuated between %0a%3c various plants : there is one, 49 however, which has been more %0a%3c particularly designated by this appellation, a branchy, shrub¬ %0a%3c like plant, with a thin stem, some three palms in height; the %0a%3c root of it is one third shorter, and the leaves, towards the lower %0a%3c part of the stem, resemble those of rue. Its diminutive %0a%3c branches bear a seed which hangs down in clusters, and has a %0a%3c vinous smell: hence it is that by some persons the plant is %0a%3c called “ botrys,” 80 while to others it is known as “ artemisia.” %0a%3c The people of Cappadocia use it for garlands. It is employed %0a%3c in medicine as a resolvent. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 12.-THE ANONIS OR 0N0NI8 : FIVE REMEDIES. %0a%3c %0a%3c The anonis, 81 by some called “ ononis” in preference, is a %0a%3c branchy plant, and similar to fenugreek in appearance, except %0a%3c that it is more shrub-like and more hairy. It has an agreeable %0a%3c smell, and becomes prickly after spring. It is pickled in brine %0a%3c for eating. Applied fresh to ulcers, it cauterizes the margins of %0a%3c them. Tor the cure of tooth-ache, the root is boiled in oxy- %0a%3c crate: taken in drink, with honey, the root expels urinary calculi. %0a%3c For epilepsy, it is administered in oxyrnel, boiled down to one %0a%3c half. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 13.-THE ANAGYROS OB ACOPON : THREE REMEDIES. %0a%3c %0a%3c The anagyros, known to some by the name of “ aco- %0a%3c %0a%3c 49 Identified with the Ambrosia maritima of Linnaeus, the Sea ambrosia. %0a%3c %0a%3c 50 The “cluster” plant.

The leaves of %0a%3c this plant are applied to gatherings, and are attached to the %0a%3c person in cases of difficult parturition, care being taken to %0a%3c remove them the moment after delivery. In cases where the %0a%3c extraction of the dead foetus is attended with difficulty, or where %0a%3c the after-birth or catamenia are retarded, the leaves are taken, in %0a%3c doses of one drachma, in raisin wine. The leaves are adminis¬ %0a%3c tered in the same manner for asthma: they are prescribed also %0a%3c in old wine, for injuries inflicted by the phalangium. 53 The %0a%3c root is employed medicinally as a resolvent and maturative: %0a%3c the seed, chewed, acts as an emetic. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAr. 14.-THE ANONYMOS : TWO REMEDIES. %0a%3c %0a%3c The anonymos, 54 through not having a name, has at last %0a%3c found one. 55 It is brought from Scythia, and has been highly %0a%3c extolled by Hicesius, a physician of no small repute, as also %0a%3c by Aristogiton. Bruised in water and applied, it is remarkably %0a%3c useful for wounds, and taken in drink it is good for blows upon %0a%3c the chest or mamillae, as also for spitting of blood: it has %0a%3c been thought, too, that it might be advantageously taken in a %0a%3c potion for wounds. I am of opinion that the additional state¬ %0a%3c ment, to the effect that, burnt fresh, it acts as a solder to iron %0a%3c or copper, is wholly fabulous. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 15.

It grows in rocky localities, and has a %0a%3c tender root, white and sweet. A decoction of it is made with %0a%3c wine for tooth-ache, being retained for that purpose in the %0a%3c mouth. The plant is taken in drink for sciatica and strangury, %0a%3c and is applied with wine to burns and chilblains, which are %0a%3c fomented also with the root and seed bruised in wine. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 17.—THE ASPLENON OK HEMIONION : TWO REMEDIES. %0a%3c %0a%3c Some persons call the asplenon 62 by the name of “ hemio- %0a%3c nion.” 63 It has numerous leaves, a third of a foot in length, %0a%3c and a slimy root, pierced with holes like that of fern, white, %0a%3c and hairy. It is destitute of stem, flower, and seed, 64 and is %0a%3c found growing upon rocks or sheltered damp walls. The most %0a%3c approved kind is that of Crete.

The flower has a %0a%3c strong offensive smell, and the seed is like that of securidaca: 67 %0a%3c it is found growing in mountainous districts. The roots are %0a%3c used for the cure of griping pains in the bowels, and of %0a%3c stings inflicted by serpents, either taken in drink or applied %0a%3c topically. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 19.-THE ASTER OR BUBONION: THREE REMEDIES. %0a%3c %0a%3c The aster 68 is called “ bubonion” by some, from the circum¬ %0a%3c stance of its being a sovereign remedy for diseases of the %0a%3c groin. It has a diminutive stem with oblong leaves, two or %0a%3c three in number ; and at the summit it is surmounted with small %0a%3c radiated heads, like stars. This plant is taken also in drink %0a%3c as an antidote to the venom of serpents: but if required for %0a%3c the cure of inguinal complaints, it is recommended that it %0a%3c should be gathered with the left hand, and attached to the %0a%3c body near the girdle. It is of great service also, worn as an %0a%3c amulet, for sciatica. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 20.-ASCYKON AND ASCYROIDES : THREE REMEDIES. %0a%3c %0a%3c Ascyron 69 and ascyroi'des are plants similar to one another, %0a%3c and to hypericon 70 as well, except that the plant known as %0a%3c %0a%3c 65 Possibly the Asclepias vincetoxicum of Linnaeus, the Common white- %0a%3c flower swallow-wort; though Fee considers it somewhat doubtful. %0a%3c %0a%3c 66 Those of Swallow-wort have no such resemblance. %0a%3c %0a%3c 67 See B. xviii. c. 44. %0a%3c %0a%3c 6H Desfontaines suggests the Inula bubonium, but Fee adopts the opinion %0a%3c of Jussieu and Sprengel, that it is the Aster amellus of Linnaeus, the %0a%3c Italian star wort. It is probably the same plant as the Inguinalis, men¬ %0a%3c tioned in B. xxvi. c. 59. %0a%3c %0a%3c 69 Identified by Fee and Desfontaines with the Hypericum androsaemum %0a%3c ot Linnaeus, the Common tutsan, or Park leaves. Littre gives as the %0a%3c synonym the Hypericum perforatum of Linnaeus, the Perforated St.John’s %0a%3c wort; which last is also preferred by Sprengel.

The pods are of a larger %0a%3c size, and enclose some three or four seeds, of a darker colour, %0a%3c moister, and more diminutive than those of the lentil: it grows %0a%3c in cultivated fields. It is naturally more astringent than the %0a%3c lentil, but in other respects is applied to much the same pur¬ %0a%3c poses.

The %0a%3c root, boiled in three cyathi of water, with the addition of twe %0a%3c cyathi of Coan wine, is slightly laxative to the bowels, and is %0a%3c consequently given for dropsy. It is curative also of uterine %0a%3c affections, and of spots upon the face in females.

As to its general utility, a plant %0a%3c so commonly found and applied to such numerous uses, people %0a%3c are universally agreed ; but with the Romans more particularly %0a%3c it has been always held in the highest esteem, from the fact of %0a%3c its being employed in their religious ceremonials. Thus, for %0a%3c instance, upon the Latin 90 Festival, it is the custom to have a %0a%3c race of four-horsed chariots in the Capital, and for the conqueror %0a%3c to be presented with a draught of wormwood; from the circum¬ %0a%3c stance, no doubt, that our forefathers were of opinion that good %0a%3c health was the most valuable reward they could bestow upon %0a%3c his skill. %0a%3c %0a%3c This plant is very strengthening to the stomach, and hence %0a%3c it is that wines are flavoured with it, as already 91 stated. A %0a%3c decoction of it in water is also taken, the following being %0a%3c the method employed in preparing it. Six drachmae of the %0a%3c leaves are boiled, with the branches, in three sextarii of rain %0a%3c water, and the preparation is then left to cool in the open air a %0a%3c day and anight. Salt, too, should be added to it. When old, it %0a%3c is utterly useless. A dilution of wormwood steeped in water %0a%3c is also used, such being the name 92 given to this method of %0a%3c preparing it. This dilution is made by leaving the vessel %0a%3c covered up for three days, any kind of water being used. %0a%3c Pounded wormwood is but rarely employed, and the same %0a%3c with the extracted juice of the seed. 93 In cases, however, %0a%3c where it is extracted, the seed is subjected to pressure as soon %0a%3c as it begins to swell, after which it is soaked for three days %0a%3c in water, if used fresh, and seven, if dry. It is then boiled %0a%3c in a copper vessel, in the proportion of ten heminae to forty- %0a%3c five sextarii of water, after which it is strained off and boiled %0a%3c %0a%3c 87 The Artemisia Pontica of Linnaeus, Little wormwood, or Roman %0a%3c wormwood. 88 See B. xi. c. 75. %0a%3c %0a%3c 89 The Artemisia absinthium of Linnaeus, Common wormwood. %0a%3c %0a%3c 90 Upon which occasion a sacrifice was offered on the Alban Mount. %0a%3c See further as to this Festival, in B. iii. c. 2. %0a%3c %0a%3c 91 In B. xiv. c. 19.

The juice, however, %0a%3c of wormwood, thus extracted, is bad for the head and stomach; %0a%3c whereas the decoction, on the other hand, is wholesome in the %0a%3c highest degree, as it acts astringently upon the stomach, carries %0a%3c off bile, is a powerful diuretic, has a soothing effect upon the %0a%3c bowels, and assuages pains in the intestines. With the addi¬ %0a%3c tion of sile, 94 Gallic nard, and a little vinegar, it dispels nausea %0a%3c and flatulency, and expels intestinal worms. It removes %0a%3c qualmishness, promotes the digestion, and, with the addition %0a%3c of rue, pepper, and salt, disperses crudities of the stomach. %0a%3c %0a%3c The ancients were in the habit of giving wormwood as a %0a%3c purgative, the dose being six drachmae of the seed with three %0a%3c of salt and one cyathus of honey, in one sextarius of sea water %0a%3c kept for some time. This preparation, however, is rendered %0a%3c more efficacious by doubling the proportion of salt; the seed, %0a%3c too, must be bruised with the greatest care, as there is con¬ %0a%3c siderable difficulty in pounding it. Some authorities have %0a%3c prescribed the dose above mentioned to be given in polenta, 94 %0a%3c with the addition of pennyroyal; while others recommend %0a%3c the leaves to be given to children in a dried fig, to disguise %0a%3c their bitterness. Taken with iris, 96 wormwood acts as a %0a%3c detergent upon the thoracic organs: for jaundice it is used %0a%3c raw, with parsley or adiantum. 97 In cases of flatulency, it is %0a%3c sipped every now and then, warmed in water; for liver com¬ %0a%3c plaints it is taken with Gallic nard, and for diseases of the %0a%3c spleen, with vinegar, pap, 98 or figs.

In order, however, to expose the %0a%3c follies of the magical art, it may not be out of place to remark %0a%3c that this plant has been selected for the above-named purpose, %0a%3c from the fact that, as it withers, it gradually contracts and %0a%3c assumes the shape of the claws of a dead kite . 16 %0a%3c %0a%3c For a similar reason we shall give no description of the %0a%3c plant called “ cemos .” 17 %0a%3c %0a%3c pbrastus, Hist. iv. 7, that it was a name for sea-weed in general, and not %0a%3c u specific plant. %0a%3c %0a%3c In reality, it is destitute of medicinal properties.

Swine are fattened upon the roots of either kind. %0a%3c The leaves of both kinds are arranged on either side in the %0a%3c form of wings, whence the Greek name “ pteris.” The roots %0a%3c are long, run obliquely, and are of a swarthy colour, more par- %0a%3c %0a%3c 64 Because it was said to be a cause of sterility. %0a%3c %0a%3c M Identified with the Dentaria enneaphylla of Linnaeus, the Nine-leaved %0a%3c tooth-wort. %0a%3c %0a%3c 66 From this remark, Fee is of opinion that he had in view more par¬ %0a%3c ticularly the Pteris aquilina and the Blechnum spicatum of Linnaeus, plants %0a%3c in which the seed is not easily detected. %0a%3c %0a%3c 67 Identified by Fee with the Polypodium filix mas of Linnaeus, the Male %0a%3c fern. %0a%3c %0a%3c 60 Dioscorides says it has a somewhat unpleasant smell, and this is nearer %0a%3c the truth. %0a%3c %0a%3c 69 “ Female fern.” Identified by Fee with the Polypodium filix faemina %0a%3c of Linnaeus, Female fern or Pteris aquilina. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 246 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c pliny’s natural history. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Hook xxvir. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ticularly when dried : when wanted for use, they should be %0a%3c dried in the sun.

When used for %0a%3c tapeworm, it is the best plan to take scammony with them, in %0a%3c equal proportions. For rheumatic defluxions, the root is taken %0a%3c in doses of two oboli, in water, after a day’s abstinence from %0a%3c food, a little honey being taken first. Neither kind must ever %0a%3c be given to females ; for in pregnancy they are productive of %0a%3c abortion, and in other cases entail sterility. Powdered fern is %0a%3c sprinkled upon sordid ulcers, as also upon the necks of beasts %0a%3c of burden, when chafed.

The leaves are similar to those of isatis, 80 but more %0a%3c unctuous, rounder, and more diminutive; the seed is enclosed %0a%3c in capsules, some being red and some black, there being %0a%3c two varieties of the plant. The female plant is generally %0a%3c thought to be the one to the root of which some six or eight %0a%3c bulbs are attached, of an elongated form; those of the male %0a%3c plant 61 being more in number, as it throws out more roots than %0a%3c one, a palm in length, and of a white colour : it has also an %0a%3c astringent taste. The leaves of the female plant smell like %0a%3c myrrh, 83 and lie closer together than those of the male. %0a%3c %0a%3c Both plants grow in the woods, and they should always be %0a%3c taken up at night, 83 it is said; as it would be dangerous to do %0a%3c so in the day-time, the woodpecker of Mars being sure to %0a%3c attack the eyes 94 of the person so engaged. It is stated also %0a%3c that the person, while taking up the root, runs great risk of %0a%3c being attacked with procidence of the anus : all this, however, %0a%3c I take to be so much fiction, most frivolously invented to puff %0a%3c off their supposed marvellous properties. Both plants are used 85 %0a%3c for various purposes: the red seed, taken in red wine, about %0a%3c fifteen in number, arrest menstruation ; while the black seed, %0a%3c taken in the same proportion, in either raisin or other wine, %0a%3c are curative of diseases of the uterus.

When %0a%3c this head is growing, in summer, small worms, 90 he says, are %0a%3c generated, which are put away in a box for keeping, and are %0a%3c attached as an amulet, with bread, to the arm on the side on %0a%3c which tooth-ache is felt; indeed it is quite wonderful, he says, %0a%3c hoiv soon the pain is removed.

When these buds %0a%3c are dry, the seeds, about the size of a peppercorn, are taken out: %0a%3c they are white, sweet, and easily cleansed from the husk. %0a%3c Twenty of them, taken in pure water or in hydromel, are %0a%3c curative of dropsy, and carry off bile. Persons who require a %0a%3c stronger purgative, take them with the husks on. They are %0a%3c apt, however, to be injurious to the stomach ; for which reason %0a%3c a plan has been adopted of taking them with fish or else %0a%3c chicken broth. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 72. -THE LEONTOPETALON OR PARDALION : TWO REMEDIES. %0a%3c %0a%3c The leontopetalon 7 is called “ pardalion” by some: it has a %0a%3c leaf like that of the cabbage, and a stem half a foot in height, %0a%3c with numerous lateral branches, and a seed at the extremities %0a%3c of them, enclosed in pods like those of the chick-pea. The root %0a%3c resembles that of rape, and is large and black: it grows in %0a%3c plough lands. The root, taken in wine, neutralizes the venom %0a%3c of all kinds of serpents; indeed, there is nothing known that %0a%3c is more speedily efficacious for that purpose.

It %0a%3c bears close to the leaves a sort of fine beard or spike, standing %0a%3c by itself, on the extremity of which there are small white stones, %0a%3c as round as a pearl, about the size of a chick-pea, and as hard as %0a%3c a pebble. These stones, 12 at the part where they adhere to %0a%3c the stalk, have a small cavity, and contain a seed within. %0a%3c %0a%3c This plant is found in Italy, no doubt, but that of Crete is %0a%3c the most esteemed. Among all the plants, there is none that %0a%3c I ever contemplated with greater admiration than this; so %0a%3c beauteous is the conformation, that it might be fancied that the %0a%3c hand of an artist 13 had arranged a row of lustrous pearls alter¬ %0a%3c nately among the leaves ; so exquisite too the nicety in thus %0a%3c making a stone to grow upon a plant! The authorities say %0a%3c that this is a creeping plant, and that it lies upon the ground ; %0a%3c but for my own part, I have only seen it when plucked, and %0a%3c not while growing. It is well known that these small stones, %0a%3c taken in doses of one drachma, in white wine, break and %0a%3c expel urinary calculi, 14 and are curative of strangury. In¬ %0a%3c deed, there is no plant that so instantaneously proclaims, at %0a%3c %0a%3c 10 Identified by Fee and Desfontaines with the Lithospermum officinale %0a%3c of Linnaeus, Gremil, gromwell, or stone-crop.

Authors have not given a description of it, beyond %0a%3c telling us that the wild leucas has larger leaves than the other, %0a%3c and has properties more strongly developed: they state also %0a%3c that the seed of the cultivated kind is the more acrid of the %0a%3c two. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 78. -THE LETJCOGRAPHIS : FIVE REMEDIES. %0a%3c %0a%3c I have not found a description given by any writer of the %0a%3c leucographis; 27 a thing I am the more surprised at, as they tell %0a%3c us that it is good for the cure of spitting of blood, taken in %0a%3c doses of three oboli with saffron; as also that it is useful for %0a%3c coeliac affections, applied beaten up in water, and in cases of %0a%3c excessive menstruation.

The juice of it, injected into the nostrils, %0a%3c arrests haemorrhage : taken with wine, it has a similar effect %0a%3c upon bleeding at any other part of the body, as also spitting %0a%3c of blood. Those who distinguish several kinds of polygonos, %0a%3c make this to be the male 54 plant, and say that it is so called %0a%3c from the large number of seeds, or else from its numerous %0a%3c branches. Some call-it “ polygonatos,” 55 from the number of %0a%3c its joints, others, again, “ teuthalis,” and others, “ carcine- %0a%3c thron,” “ clema,” or “ myrtopetalos.” %0a%3c %0a%3c There are some authorities to be found, however, who say that %0a%3c this is the female plant, and that the male is more diminutive, %0a%3c less swarthy, and more jointed, with a seed protruding beneath %0a%3c all the leaves. However this may be, these plants are of an %0a%3c astringent, cooling nature. The seed is laxative, and, taken in %0a%3c large doses, acts as a diuretic, and arrests defluxions; indeed, %0a%3c if there is no defluxion, it is of no use taking it. Tor burning %0a%3c heats of the stomach, the leaves are applied topically ; and they %0a%3c are used, in the form of a liniment, for pains in the bladder, and %0a%3c for erysipelas. The juice is used as an injection for suppurations %0a%3c of the ears, and by itself, for pains in the eyes. It is admi¬ %0a%3c nistered, also, in fevers, tertian and quartan fevers more par¬ %0a%3c ticularly, in doses of two cyathi, just before the paroxysms %0a%3c come ou; as also in cases of cholera, dysentery, and derange¬ %0a%3c ment of the stomach. %0a%3c %0a%3c There is a third kind, which grows on the mountains, and is %0a%3c known as “orios,” 66 similar to a delicate reed in appearance, and %0a%3c %0a%3c 52 “ Many-seeded.” 53 “ Blood plant.” %0a%3c %0a%3c 54 Identified by Fee with the Polygonum aviculare of Linnaeus, the %0a%3c Knot-grass. %0a%3c %0a%3c w “Many-knotted.” Scribonius says that it received its name, “poly¬ %0a%3c gonos,” from its being found everywhere. %0a%3c %0a%3c 56 Or “ mountain ” plant.

This variety, however, is not %0a%3c so efficacious as those already mentioned, and, indeed, is used %0a%3c exclusively for sciatica. A fourth kind is known as the wild 17 %0a%3c polygonos : it is a shrub, almost a tree in fact, with a ligneous %0a%3c root, a red trunk like that of the cedar, and branches resem¬ %0a%3c bling those of spartum, 58 a couple of palms in length, and with %0a%3c three or four dark-coloured, knotted joints. This kind, also, is %0a%3c of an astringent nature, and has a flavour like that of the %0a%3c quince. It is either boiled down in water to one third, or else %0a%3c dried and powdered for sprinkling upon ulceratioriB of the %0a%3c mouth and excoriations: it is chewed, also, for affections of %0a%3c the gums.

Reduced %0a%3c to powder, it is sprinkled upon malignant ulcers, and is given %0a%3c internally for spitting of hlood, in doses of one drachma, in %0a%3c water. For dysentery and coeliac affections, if unattended %0a%3c with fever, it is administered in wine; but if there is fever, in %0a%3c water.

From the midst of these shoots the leaves make %0a%3c their appearance, unctuous, and bending towards the ground. %0a%3c This plant has a medicinal smell, penetrating to a certain %0a%3c degree, and agreeable: the colour of it is a pale yellow, and %0a%3c the stems bear rounded umbels like those of dill, 94 with a %0a%3c round, black seed, which dries at the beginning of summer. %0a%3c The root, also, is odoriferous, of an acrid, pungent flavour, soft %0a%3c and juicy, black on the outer coat and pale within. The smell %0a%3c of it partakes very much of the nature of that of myrrh, to %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 87 “ Reseda, morbos reseda.” A pun upon the name of the plant, and %0a%3c the verb “resedo.” %0a%3c %0a%3c 88 Like the silly charm itself, “ neither head nor tail.” %0a%3c %0a%3c 89 See B. xxvi. c. 27. %0a%3c %0a%3c 90 The Stcechades.

Its medicinal properties %0a%3c are warming and resolvent. %0a%3c %0a%3c The leaves and root are used as a diuretic and as an emmen- %0a%3c agogue ; the seed arrests diarrhoea; and the root, applied topi¬ %0a%3c cally, disperses abscesses and suppurations, provided they are %0a%3c not inveterate, and reduces indurated tumours. It is useful, %0a%3c also, for injuries inflicted by the phalangium and by serpents, %0a%3c taken in wine, with the addition of cachrys, 95 polium, 96 or me- %0a%3c lissophyllum ; 91 the dose, however, must be taken a little at a %0a%3c time only, for otherwise it acts as an emetic, a reason for which %0a%3c it is sometimes administered with rue. The seed or root is %0a%3c curative of cough, hardness of breathing, and diseases of the %0a%3c thoracic organs, spleen, kidneys, and bladder; the root, too, is %0a%3c used for ruptures and convulsions. This plant facilitates %0a%3c delivery, and brings away the afterbirth; it is also given, iu %0a%3c combination with crethmos, 98 in wine, for sciatica. It acts as a %0a%3c sudorific and carminative, for which reason it is used to disperse %0a%3c flatulency of the stomach ; it promotes, also, the cicatrization %0a%3c of wounds. %0a%3c %0a%3c A juice is extracted from the root, which is very useful for %0a%3c female complaints, and for affections of the thoracic organs %0a%3c and viscera, possessing, as it does, certain calorific, digestive, %0a%3c and detergent properties. The seed, in particular, is given in %0a%3c drink for dropsy, external applications being made of the %0a%3c juice, and emollient poultices applied of the dried rind of the %0a%3c root. It is used, also, as a seasoning for food, boiled meat in %0a%3c particular, with the addition of honied wine, oil, and garum." %0a%3c %0a%3c Sinon, 1 a plant with a flavour very like that of pepper, pro¬ %0a%3c motes the digestion, and is highly efficacious for pains in the %0a%3c stomach. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 110. -TELEPHION : FOUR REMEDIES. %0a%3c %0a%3c Telephion 2 resembles purslain in the stem and leaves.

A decoction of this %0a%3c plant, taken in white wine, with the addition of wild cummin, %0a%3c is curative of strangury. Bruised and applied to the head, it %0a%3c prevents the hair from falling off, and, where it has come off, %0a%3c restores it: pounded and applied with oil, it effects the cure %0a%3c of alopecy.

It is used, also, for sciatica, %0a%3c in the form of an injection, this treatment being persevered in %0a%3c until it has induced a discharge of blood : it acts also as an %0a%3c einnienagogue, but is fatal to the foetus. %0a%3c %0a%3c The other thlaspi, known by some as “ Persicon napy,” 11 has %0a%3c broad leaves and large roots, and is also very useful as an %0a%3c injection for sciatica. Both plants are very serviceable for in¬ %0a%3c guinal complaints ; it being recommended that the person who %0a%3c gathers them should mention that he is taking them for diseases %0a%3c of the groin, for abscesses of all kinds, and for wounds, and %0a%3c that he should pluck them with one hand only. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 114. - THE TRACniNIA !

Ten or twelve tops of the branches, bruised %0a%3c and taken in wane, are remedial in cases of coeliac affections, %0a%3c dysentery, spitting of blood, and excessive menstruation. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 117. —THE TRAGOPOGON OR COME. %0a%3c %0a%3c There is the tragopogon, 16 also, by some called “ comea %0a%3c plant with a small stem, leaves like those of saffron, an elon¬ %0a%3c gated, sweet, root, and a large, swarthy calyx at the extremity %0a%3c of the stem.

At %0a%3c the close of this subject, it seems to me that it will not be out %0a%3c of place to remind the reader, that the properties of plants %0a%3c vary according to their age. It is elaterium, as already %0a%3c stated,' 6 that preserves its properties the longest of all. The %0a%3c black chamseleon 16 * retains its virtues forty years, centaury not %0a%3c more than twelve, peucedanum 17 and aristolochia 18 six, and %0a%3c the wild vine one year—that is to say, if they are kept in the %0a%3c shade. I would remark, also, that beyond those animals which %0a%3c breed within the plants, there are none that attack the roots %0a%3c %0a%3c 11 See B. xiii. c. 37. M.

The efficacy, too, of all plants is impaired %0a%3c by making habitual use of them ; and these substances, if em¬ %0a%3c ployed daily, lose equally their good or bad properties, when %0a%3c required to be effectual. All plants, too, have more powerful %0a%3c properties, when grown in soils that are cold and exposed to %0a%3c the north-eastern blasts, or in dry localities. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 120. -MALADIES PECULIAR TO VARIOUS NATIONS. %0a%3c %0a%3c There are certain differences, also, by no means inconsider¬ %0a%3c able, in the predispositions of the various nations of the earth. %0a%3c I have been informed, for instance, that the people of Egypt, %0a%3c Arabia, Syria, and Cilicia, are subject to tapeworm and maw- %0a%3c worm, while those of Thracia and Phrygia, on the other hand, %0a%3c are totally exempt from them. This, however, is less sur¬ %0a%3c prising than the fact that, although Attica and Boeotia are %0a%3c adjoining territories, the Thebans are troubled with these %0a%3c inflictions, while among the people of Athens they are un¬ %0a%3c known. %0a%3c %0a%3c Considerations of this description lead me now to turn my %0a%3c attention to the nature of the animated beings themselves, and %0a%3c the medicinal properties which are inborn in them, the most %0a%3c assured remedies, perhaps, for all diseases. %0a%3c %0a%3c For Nature, in fact, that parent of all things, has produced no %0a%3c animated being for the purpose solely of eating ; she has willed %0a%3c that it should be born to satisfy the wants of others, and in %0a%3c its very vitals has implanted medicaments conducive to health. %0a%3c While she has implanted them in mute 21 and inanimate %0a%3c objects even, she has equally willed that these, the most in- %0a%3c %0a%3c 19 A kind of foetid beetle, Hardouin says.

Fee deserves our thanks %0a%3c almost equally with the learned Sillig—now, alas ! no more—is to say much %0a%3c indeed in his praise, and to bestow upon him a commendation to which be %0a%3c is eminently entitled. %0a%3c %0a%3c 22 See end of B. xx. 23 See end of B. xiv. %0a%3c %0a%3c 24 See end of B. xii. 25 See end of B. xx. %0a%3c %0a%3c 26 See end of B. xx. 27 See end of B. vii. %0a%3c %0a%3c 28 See end of B iii. 29 See end of B. xi. %0a%3c %0a%3c 30 See end of B. ii. %0a%3c %0a%3c 31 Beyond being mentioned here, and in c. 14 of this Book, nothing ii %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c known of this writer. %0a%3c %0a%3c 33 See end of B. ii. %0a%3c %0a%3c 35 See end of B. xix. %0a%3c 37 See end of B. xix. %0a%3c 39 See end of B. xxi. %0a%3c 41 See end of B. xx. %0a%3c 43 See end of B. xv. %0a%3c 45 See end of B. xv. %0a%3c 47 See end of B. xx. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 32 See end of B. xx. %0a%3c 34 See end of B. viii. %0a%3c 36 See end of B. viii. %0a%3c 38 See end of B. xxi. %0a%3c 40 See end of B. vii. %0a%3c 42 See end of B. xx. %0a%3c 44 See end of B. xii. %0a%3c 46 See end of B. xii. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c SUMMARY. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 273 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c lodorus 49 of Tarentum, Traxagoras, 49 Plistonicus, 60 Medius, 51 %0a%3c Dieuches, 52 Cleophantus, 53 Philistion, 84 Asclepiades, 55 Crateuas, 56 %0a%3c Petronius Diodotus, 57 Iollas, 58 Erasistratus," Diagoras, 60 An¬ %0a%3c dreas, 61 Mnesides, 62 Epicharmus, 63 Damion, 64 Tlepolemus,* 5 Mo- %0a%3c trodorus, 66 Solo, 67 Lyons, 6& Olympias 69 of Thebes, Philinus, 70 %0a%3c Petrichus, 71 Micton, 72 Glaucias, 73 Xenocrates. 74 %0a%3c %0a%3c •,* Before quitting the Botanical Books of Pliny, it is a duty both to %0a%3c our author and to the reader, to call attention to the illustrations of a few %0a%3c passages in this work, which will he found in the Textrinurn Antiquorum, %0a%3c by Dr. James Yates, F.R.S., a book characterized by learning, equally pro¬ %0a%3c found and extensive, and the most indefatigable research: it being but re¬ %0a%3c cently, we are sorry to say, that we have been made acquainted with its %0a%3c valuable contents. %0a%3c %0a%3c The following are selected as among the most useful and interesting results %0a%3c of his enquiries. %0a%3c %0a%3c B. vi. c. 20 [Y. ii. p. 36]. Dr. Yates is of opinion that Pliny has here %0a%3c mistranslated a passage of Aristotle, Hist. Anim. v. 19, and that he has %0a%3c mistaken the word (3onf3vicia , “cocoons,” for webs, similar to those of %0a%3c the spider, attached to the leaves of trees. Not understanding the original, %0a%3c he would seem to have given a distorted account of the simple operation %0a%3c of winding the threads from off the cocoons of the silkworm upon bobbins, %0a%3c by the bands of females ; the threads upon which bobbins would be after¬ %0a%3c wards unwound for the manufacture of silken fabrics. See Notes 8 and 9 %0a%3c on the passage in question; also B. xi. c. 26. %0a%3c %0a%3c B. viii. c. 74 [V. ii. p. 336]. For the word “ Sororiculata,” Dr. Yates %0a%3c proposes to read “ Soriculata,” and he suggests that the cloth thus called %0a%3c may have been a velvet or plush, which received its name from its resem¬ %0a%3c blance to the coat of the field-mouse, “sorex,” the diminutive of which %0a%3c would be “ soricula.” %0a%3c %0a%3c B. xix. c. 2 [Y. iv. p. 133] and c. 6 [p. 138]. Dr. Yates expresses it %0a%3c as bis opinion that the words “Carbasus” and “Carbasa” are derived from %0a%3c the oriental word Carpets, signifying “cotton,” and thinks that Pliny, in %0a%3c B. xix. c. 2, may have used the word by Catachresis, as meaning linen, in %0a%3c the same manner as the Latin poets repeatedly use the word “ carbasa,” %0a%3c ** signifying various kinds of woven textures. If this view be correct, %0a%3c the word “Carbasina” in B. xix. c. 6, will probably mean “awnings of %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 4fl %0a%3c %0a%3c See %0a%3c %0a%3c end %0a%3c %0a%3c of %0a%3c %0a%3c B. %0a%3c %0a%3c XX. %0a%3c %0a%3c 49 %0a%3c %0a%3c See %0a%3c %0a%3c end %0a%3c %0a%3c 61 %0a%3c %0a%3c Sec %0a%3c %0a%3c end %0a%3c %0a%3c of %0a%3c %0a%3c B. %0a%3c %0a%3c XX. %0a%3c %0a%3c 52 %0a%3c %0a%3c See %0a%3c %0a%3c end %0a%3c %0a%3c 64 %0a%3c %0a%3c See %0a%3c %0a%3c end %0a%3c %0a%3c of %0a%3c %0a%3c B. %0a%3c %0a%3c XX. %0a%3c %0a%3c 55 %0a%3c %0a%3c See %0a%3c %0a%3c end %0a%3c %0a%3c 67 %0a%3c %0a%3c See %0a%3c %0a%3c end %0a%3c %0a%3c of %0a%3c %0a%3c B. %0a%3c %0a%3c XX. %0a%3c %0a%3c 59 %0a%3c %0a%3c See %0a%3c %0a%3c end %0a%3c %0a%3c 60 %0a%3c %0a%3c See %0a%3c %0a%3c end %0a%3c %0a%3c of %0a%3c %0a%3c B. %0a%3c %0a%3c xii. %0a%3c %0a%3c 61 %0a%3c %0a%3c See %0a%3c %0a%3c end %0a%3c %0a%3c 63 %0a%3c %0a%3c See %0a%3c %0a%3c end %0a%3c %0a%3c of %0a%3c %0a%3c B. %0a%3c %0a%3c XX. %0a%3c %0a%3c 64 %0a%3c %0a%3c See %0a%3c %0a%3c end %0a%3c %0a%3c (6 %0a%3c %0a%3c See %0a%3c %0a%3c end %0a%3c %0a%3c of %0a%3c %0a%3c B. %0a%3c %0a%3c XX. %0a%3c %0a%3c 67 %0a%3c %0a%3c See %0a%3c %0a%3c end %0a%3c %0a%3c *9 %0a%3c %0a%3c See %0a%3c %0a%3c end %0a%3c %0a%3c of %0a%3c %0a%3c B. %0a%3c %0a%3c XX. %0a%3c %0a%3c 70 %0a%3c %0a%3c See %0a%3c %0a%3c end %0a%3c %0a%3c 71 %0a%3c %0a%3c See %0a%3c %0a%3c end %0a%3c %0a%3c of %0a%3c %0a%3c B. %0a%3c %0a%3c XX. %0a%3c %0a%3c 73 %0a%3c %0a%3c See %0a%3c %0a%3c end %0a%3c %0a%3c VOL. %0a%3c %0a%3c V. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c of %0a%3c %0a%3c B. %0a%3c %0a%3c XX. %0a%3c %0a%3c 50 %0a%3c %0a%3c See %0a%3c %0a%3c end %0a%3c %0a%3c of %0a%3c %0a%3c B. %0a%3c %0a%3c XX, %0a%3c %0a%3c of %0a%3c %0a%3c B. %0a%3c %0a%3c XX. %0a%3c %0a%3c 53 %0a%3c %0a%3c See %0a%3c %0a%3c end %0a%3c %0a%3c of %0a%3c %0a%3c B. %0a%3c %0a%3c XX. %0a%3c %0a%3c of %0a%3c %0a%3c B. %0a%3c %0a%3c vii. %0a%3c %0a%3c 56 %0a%3c %0a%3c See %0a%3c %0a%3c end %0a%3c %0a%3c of %0a%3c %0a%3c B. %0a%3c %0a%3c XX. %0a%3c %0a%3c of %0a%3c %0a%3c B. %0a%3c %0a%3c xii. %0a%3c %0a%3c 59 %0a%3c %0a%3c See %0a%3c %0a%3c end %0a%3c %0a%3c of %0a%3c %0a%3c B. %0a%3c %0a%3c xi. %0a%3c %0a%3c of %0a%3c %0a%3c B. %0a%3c %0a%3c XX. %0a%3c %0a%3c 62 %0a%3c %0a%3c See %0a%3c %0a%3c end %0a%3c %0a%3c of %0a%3c %0a%3c B. %0a%3c %0a%3c xii. %0a%3c %0a%3c of %0a%3c %0a%3c B. %0a%3c %0a%3c XX. %0a%3c %0a%3c 65 %0a%3c %0a%3c See %0a%3c %0a%3c end %0a%3c %0a%3c of %0a%3c %0a%3c B. %0a%3c %0a%3c XX. %0a%3c %0a%3c of %0a%3c %0a%3c B. %0a%3c %0a%3c XX. %0a%3c %0a%3c 68 %0a%3c %0a%3c See %0a%3c %0a%3c end %0a%3c %0a%3c of %0a%3c %0a%3c B. %0a%3c %0a%3c xii. %0a%3c %0a%3c of %0a%3c %0a%3c B. %0a%3c %0a%3c XX. %0a%3c %0a%3c 71 %0a%3c %0a%3c See %0a%3c %0a%3c end %0a%3c %0a%3c of %0a%3c %0a%3c B. %0a%3c %0a%3c xxi. %0a%3c %0a%3c of %0a%3c %0a%3c B. %0a%3c %0a%3c XX. %0a%3c %0a%3c 74 %0a%3c %0a%3c See %0a%3c %0a%3c end %0a%3c %0a%3c of %0a%3c %0a%3c B. %0a%3c %0a%3c XX. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c T %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Cook XXVII. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 274 pliny’s natural history. %0a%3c %0a%3c woven material " generally, and not of fine linen, or cambric, as suggested %0a%3c in Note 55. %0a%3c %0a%3c B. xix. c. 2 [Y. iv. p. 134]. The genuineness of the passage which %0a%3c makes mention of the “ Gossypium,” is questioned by Dr. lutes, who %0a%3c thinks it possible that it is an interpolation: such, however, if we may %0a%3c judge from the result of Sillig’s researches, does not appear to have been %0a%3c the case. If, on the other hand, the passage is genuine, Dr. Yates is of %0a%3c opinion that the statement is incorrect, and that cotton was not grown in %0a%3c Egypt. It seems just possible, however, that Pliny may have had in view %0a%3c the trees mentioned by him in B. xiv. c. 28. %0a%3c %0a%3c B. xix. c. 4 [V. iv. p. 137, also p. 134, Note 37]. Dr. Yates has ad¬ %0a%3c duced a number of convincing arguments to prove that the “ Byssus " of %0a%3c the ancients cannot have been cotton, but that in all probability it was a %0a%3c texture of fine flax. The passages of Pausanias, (B. v. c. 25, and B. vi. %0a%3c c. 26) in which “Byssus” is mentioned, would certainly seem to apply %0a%3c to flax, a product which is still cultivated near the mouth of the river %0a%3c Peneus, in ancient Elis. There is no doubt, however, that Philostratus, %0a%3c though perhaps erroneously, has used the word “ Byssus ” as meaning %0a%3c cotton. %0a\ No newline at end of file%0a
