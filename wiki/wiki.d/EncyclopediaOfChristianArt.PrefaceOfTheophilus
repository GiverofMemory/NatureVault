text=PREFACE    OF   THEOPHILUS. %0a%0a%0aA  LL  arts  are  taught  by  degrees.  The  first  process %0a-^-^-  in  art  of  the  painter  is  the  composition  of  colours. %0aLet  your  mind  be  afterwards  applied  to  the  study  of %0athe  mixtures.  Practise  this  labour,  but  restrain  all %0athings  with  precision,  that  your  painting  may  be  beau- %0atiful and  natural.  Your  artistic  skill  will  afterwards %0abe  increased  by  the  descriptions  of  many  inventions,  as %0athis  book  will  teach  you. %0a%0a%0aI,  Theophilus,  an  humble  priest,  servant  of  the  ser- %0avants of  God,  unworthy  of  the  name  and  profession  of %0aa  monk,  to  all  wishing  to  overcome  or  avoid  sloth  of %0athe  mind  or  wandering  of  the  soul,  by  useful  manual %0aoccupation  and  the  delightful  contemplation  of  novel- %0aties, send  a  recompense  of  heavenly  price. %0a%0aWe  read  in  the  exordium  of  mundane  creation  that %0aman,  made  after  the  image  and  likeness  of  God  and %0aanimated  by  the  inspiration  of  the  Divine  breath,  was %0aalso,  by  the  excellence  of  so  much  dignity,  raised  above %0aother  living  creatures ;  as  capable  of  reason,  he  merited %0ato  participate  in  the  counsel  and  genius  of  Divine  pro- %0avidence, and,  gifted  with  free-will,  he  beheld  superior %0ato  himself  but  the  will  of  his  Maker  and  the  obliga- %0ation to  reverence  his  decree.  Wherefore,  miserably %0adeceived  by  diabolical  astuteness,  he  lost  the  privilege %0aof  immortality  through  the  fault  of  disobedience,  yet %0a80  transmitted  his  power  of  wisdom  and  intelligence  to %0ahis  posterity,  that  whoever  would  supply  care  and  ap- %0aplication might  be  able  to  acquire  a  capability  of  every %0aart  and  science,  as  by  an  hereditary  right. %0a%0aIn  this  manner,  human  industry,  seizing  upon  this %0afaculty  and  applying  itself  in  its  divers  acts  to  gain  and %0ato  pleasure,  transmitted  it,  through  the  development %0aof  time,  to  the  predestined  epoch  of  the  Christian  reli- %0agion, and  it  came  to  pass  that  a  people  devoted  to %0aGod  converted  to  his  worship  that  which  Divine  ordi- %0anance had,  to  the  praise  and  glory  of  His  name,  created. %0aOn  this  account,  the  pious  devotion  of  the  faithful %0amay  not  neglect  that  which  the  careful  prevision  of %0aour  predecessors  transmitted  to  our  age;  and  may %0aman  embrace  with  all  avidity  that  which  God  has %0aconferred  upon  man,  as  an  inheritance,  and  labour  to %0aacquire  it. %0a%0aSkilful  in  which  let  no  one  glorify  himself  inwardly, %0aas  if  received  from  himself  and  not  from  elsewhere,  but %0alet  him  be  thankful  humbly  in  the  Lord,  from  whom %0aand  through  whom  all  things  are  received,  and  without %0awhom,  nothing ;  nor  let  him  wrap  his  gifts  in  the  folds %0aof  envy,  nor  hide  them  in  the  closet  of  an  avaricious %0aheart,  but,  all  jealous  feeling  repelled,  let  him  with %0acheerful  mind  answer  with  simplicity  to  those  seeking %0ahim,  and  let  him  fear  the  judgment  of  the  Gospel %0aupon  that  merchant,  who,  failing  to  return  to  his  lord  a %0atalent  with  accumulated  interest,  deprived  of  all  re- %0award, merited  the  censure  from  the  mouth  of  his  judge %0aof  "wicked  servant." %0a%0aFearins:  to  incur  which  sentence,  I,  frail  and  un- %0aworthy  and  almost  without  name,  offer  gratuitously  to %0aall  desirous  with  humility  to  learn,  that,  which  Divine %0aauthority,  which  affluently  and  not  precipitately  gives  to %0aall,  gratuitously  conceded  to  me,  and  I  admonish  them%0athat  in  me  they  may  recognise  the  goodness  and  ad- %0amire the  generosity  of  God,  and  I  advise  them  likewise %0athat  if  to  this  their  labours  are  added,  they  may  believe %0abeyond  a  doubt  that  excellence  aivaits  them. %0a%0aAnd  as  it  is  iniquitous  and  detestable  to  a  man  to %0aappropriate  through  coTotousness,  in  any  manner,  that %0awhich  is  unlawful,  or  undue,  or  to  seize  it  with  theft,  so %0aalso  to  neglect  untried,  or  contemptuously  to  turn  from %0aan  heritage  given  as  a  right  by  God  the  Father,  is  to %0abe  ascribed  to  cowardice,  and  folly.  Whoever  thou %0aart,  therefore,  dearest  son,  in  whose  heart  God  has %0aplaced  the  desire  to  explore  the  vast  field  of  the  divers %0aarts,  and  to  bring  thereto  intellect  and  care,  that  thou %0amayest  afterwards  collect  therefrom  that  which  may %0aplease  thee,  think  not  thou  cheaply  of  any  precious  and %0auseful  things ;  as  if  the  domestic  soil  produced  them %0afor  thee  spontaneously,  or  unsought  for ;  he  would  be  a %0afoolish  calculator  who  suddenly  finding  a  treasure  in  a %0ahole  in  the  ground,  should  neglect  to  gather  and  keep  it. %0aRut  if  for  thee  the  common  shrubs  produced  myrrh, %0athus  and  balsam,  or  the  domestic  springs  poured  forth %0aoil,  milk  and  honey,  or,  for  the  nettle  and  thistle  and %0aother  weeds  of  the  garden,  grew  spikenard  and  cin- %0anamon and  aromatics  of  various  kinds,  wouldst  thou, %0athese  being  despised  as  common  and  domestic,  travel %0aover  lands  and  seas  after  foreign  things  not  better,  but %0aperhaps  more  vile  in  comparison?  this,  in  thine  ovm %0ajudgment,  would  be  a  great  folly.  For  however  men %0aare  accustomed  to  place  in  the  first  rank  and  to  keep %0awith  the  greatest  care  some  precious  things  sought %0awith  much  labour  and  acquired  with  great  expense, %0ayet,  if  by  chance  they  are  sometimes  met  with  cheaply, %0aor  like,  or  better  things,  are  found,  they  are  preserved %0awith  a  similar,  yes,  with  a  greater  care. %0a%0aWherefore,  gentle  son,  whom  God  has  rendered  per- %0afectly happy  in  this  respect,  that  those  things  are  of- %0afered to  thee  gratis  which  many,  ploughing  the  sea^ %0awaves  with  the  greatest  danger  to  life,  consumed  by %0athe  hardship  of  hunger  and  cold,  or  subjected  to  the %0aweary  servitude  of  teachers,  and  altogether  worn  out %0aby  the  desire  of  learning,  yet  acquire  with  intolerable %0alabour,  covet  with  greedy  looks  this  "  book  op  various %0aARTS,*'  read  it  through  with  a  tenacious  memory,  em- %0abrace it  with  an  ardent  love. %0a%0aShould  you  carefully  peruse  this,  you  will  there  find %0aout  whatever  Greece  possesses  in  kinds  and  mixtures  of %0avarious  colours ;  whatever  Tuscany  knows  of  in  mosaic %0awork,  or  in  variety  of  enamel ;  whatever  Arabia  shows %0aforth  in  work  of  fusion,  ductility,  or  chasing ;  whatever %0aItaly  ornaments  with  gold,  in  diversity  of  vases  and %0asculpture  of  gems  or  ivory ;  whatever  France  loves  in %0aa  costly  variety  of  windows;  whatever  industrious %0aGermany  approves  in  work  of  gold,  silver,  copper  and %0airon,  of  woods  and  of  stones. %0a%0aWhen  you  shall  have  re-read  this  often,  and  have %0acommitted  it  to  your  tenacious  memory,  you  shall  thus %0arecompense  me  for  this  care  of  instruction,  that  as  often %0aas  you  shall  successfully  have  made  use  of  my  work, %0ayou  pray  for  me  for  the  pity  of  Omnipotent  God,  who %0aknows  that  I  have  written  these  things,  which  are  here %0aarranged,  neither  through  love  of  human  approbation, %0anor  through  desire  of  temporal  reward,  nor  have  I %0astolen  anything  precious  or  rare  through  envious  jea- %0alousy, nor  have  I  kept  back  anything  reserved  for %0amyself  alone ;  but  in  augmentation  of  the  honour  and %0aglory  of  His  name,  I  have  consulted  the  progress  and %0ahastened  to  aid  the  necessities  of  many  men. %0a%0a%0aBEBATA. %0a%0aPage  XXX,  line  9, /or  Vanri  hisiBelf,  read  Halyaaia. %0a%0axzxiii,  line  8  of  note,  for  1  pound  Hthajge  (spigtlhari),  read  1  pound %0a%0aglass  (or  dear)  renn. %0aIdem,  line  6, /or  litharge,  read  resin. %0a97,  line  30, /or  painting  oil,  read  preparing  oil. %0a101,  for  PanielinoB,  read  Panselinos. %0a%0a%0acuuji   1.

The  first  process %0a%3c -^-^-  in  art  of  the  painter  is  the  composition  of  colours. %0a%3c Let  your  mind  be  afterwards  applied  to  the  study  of %0a%3c the  mixtures.  Practise  this  labour,  but  restrain  all %0a%3c things  with  precision,  that  your  painting  may  be  beau- %0a%3c tiful and  natural.  Your  artistic  skill  will  afterwards %0a%3c be  increased  by  the  descriptions  of  many  inventions,  as %0a%3c this  book  will  teach  you. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c I,  Theophilus,  an  humble  priest,  servant  of  the  ser- %0a%3c vants of  God,  unworthy  of  the  name  and  profession  of %0a%3c a  monk,  to  all  wishing  to  overcome  or  avoid  sloth  of %0a%3c the  mind  or  wandering  of  the  soul,  by  useful  manual %0a%3c occupation  and  the  delightful  contemplation  of  novel- %0a%3c ties, send  a  recompense  of  heavenly  price. %0a%3c %0a%3c We  read  in  the  exordium  of  mundane  creation  that %0a%3c man,  made  after  the  image  and  likeness  of  God  and %0a%3c animated  by  the  inspiration  of  the  Divine  breath,  was %0a%3c also,  by  the  excellence  of  so  much  dignity,  raised  above %0a%3c other  living  creatures ;  as  capable  of  reason,  he  merited %0a%3c to  participate  in  the  counsel  and  genius  of  Divine  pro- %0a%3c vidence, and,  gifted  with  free-will,  he  beheld  superior %0a%3c to  himself  but  the  will  of  his  Maker  and  the  obliga- %0a%3c tion to  reverence  his  decree.  Wherefore,  miserably %0a%3c deceived  by  diabolical  astuteness,  he  lost  the  privilege %0a%3c of  immortality  through  the  fault  of  disobedience,  yet %0a%3c 80  transmitted  his  power  of  wisdom  and  intelligence  to %0a%3c his  posterity,  that  whoever  would  supply  care  and  ap- %0a%3c plication might  be  able  to  acquire  a  capability  of  every %0a%3c art  and  science,  as  by  an  hereditary  right. %0a%3c %0a%3c In  this  manner,  human  industry,  seizing  upon  this %0a%3c faculty  and  applying  itself  in  its  divers  acts  to  gain  and %0a%3c to  pleasure,  transmitted  it,  through  the  development %0a%3c of  time,  to  the  predestined  epoch  of  the  Christian  reli- %0a%3c gion, and  it  came  to  pass  that  a  people  devoted  to %0a%3c God  converted  to  his  worship  that  which  Divine  ordi- %0a%3c nance had,  to  the  praise  and  glory  of  His  name,  created. %0a%3c On  this  account,  the  pious  devotion  of  the  faithful %0a%3c may  not  neglect  that  which  the  careful  prevision  of %0a%3c our  predecessors  transmitted  to  our  age;  and  may %0a%3c man  embrace  with  all  avidity  that  which  God  has %0a%3c conferred  upon  man,  as  an  inheritance,  and  labour  to %0a%3c acquire  it. %0a%3c %0a%3c Skilful  in  which  let  no  one  glorify  himself  inwardly, %0a%3c as  if  received  from  himself  and  not  from  elsewhere,  but %0a%3c let  him  be  thankful  humbly  in  the  Lord,  from  whom %0a%3c and  through  whom  all  things  are  received,  and  without %0a%3c whom,  nothing ;  nor  let  him  wrap  his  gifts  in  the  folds %0a%3c of  envy,  nor  hide  them  in  the  closet  of  an  avaricious %0a%3c heart,  but,  all  jealous  feeling  repelled,  let  him  with %0a%3c cheerful  mind  answer  with  simplicity  to  those  seeking %0a%3c him,  and  let  him  fear  the  judgment  of  the  Gospel %0a%3c upon  that  merchant,  who,  failing  to  return  to  his  lord  a %0a%3c talent  with  accumulated  interest,  deprived  of  all  re- %0a%3c ward, merited  the  censure  from  the  mouth  of  his  judge %0a%3c of  "wicked  servant." %0a%3c %0a%3c Fearins:  to  incur  which  sentence,  I,  frail  and  un- %0a%3c worthy  and  almost  without  name,  offer  gratuitously  to %0a%3c all  desirous  with  humility  to  learn,  that,  which  Divine %0a%3c authority,  which  affluently  and  not  precipitately  gives  to %0a%3c all,  gratuitously  conceded  to  me,  and  I  admonish  them%0a%3c that  in  me  they  may  recognise  the  goodness  and  ad- %0a%3c mire the  generosity  of  God,  and  I  advise  them  likewise %0a%3c that  if  to  this  their  labours  are  added,  they  may  believe %0a%3c beyond  a  doubt  that  excellence  aivaits  them. %0a%3c %0a%3c And  as  it  is  iniquitous  and  detestable  to  a  man  to %0a%3c appropriate  through  coTotousness,  in  any  manner,  that %0a%3c which  is  unlawful,  or  undue,  or  to  seize  it  with  theft,  so %0a%3c also  to  neglect  untried,  or  contemptuously  to  turn  from %0a%3c an  heritage  given  as  a  right  by  God  the  Father,  is  to %0a%3c be  ascribed  to  cowardice,  and  folly.  Whoever  thou %0a%3c art,  therefore,  dearest  son,  in  whose  heart  God  has %0a%3c placed  the  desire  to  explore  the  vast  field  of  the  divers %0a%3c arts,  and  to  bring  thereto  intellect  and  care,  that  thou %0a%3c mayest  afterwards  collect  therefrom  that  which  may %0a%3c please  thee,  think  not  thou  cheaply  of  any  precious  and %0a%3c useful  things ;  as  if  the  domestic  soil  produced  them %0a%3c for  thee  spontaneously,  or  unsought  for ;  he  would  be  a %0a%3c foolish  calculator  who  suddenly  finding  a  treasure  in  a %0a%3c hole  in  the  ground,  should  neglect  to  gather  and  keep  it. %0a%3c Rut  if  for  thee  the  common  shrubs  produced  myrrh, %0a%3c thus  and  balsam,  or  the  domestic  springs  poured  forth %0a%3c oil,  milk  and  honey,  or,  for  the  nettle  and  thistle  and %0a%3c other  weeds  of  the  garden,  grew  spikenard  and  cin- %0a%3c namon and  aromatics  of  various  kinds,  wouldst  thou, %0a%3c these  being  despised  as  common  and  domestic,  travel %0a%3c over  lands  and  seas  after  foreign  things  not  better,  but %0a%3c perhaps  more  vile  in  comparison?  this,  in  thine  ovm %0a%3c judgment,  would  be  a  great  folly.  For  however  men %0a%3c are  accustomed  to  place  in  the  first  rank  and  to  keep %0a%3c with  the  greatest  care  some  precious  things  sought %0a%3c with  much  labour  and  acquired  with  great  expense, %0a%3c yet,  if  by  chance  they  are  sometimes  met  with  cheaply, %0a%3c or  like,  or  better  things,  are  found,  they  are  preserved %0a%3c with  a  similar,  yes,  with  a  greater  care. %0a%3c %0a%3c Wherefore,  gentle  son,  whom  God  has  rendered  per- %0a%3c fectly happy  in  this  respect,  that  those  things  are  of- %0a%3c fered to  thee  gratis  which  many,  ploughing  the  sea^ %0a%3c waves  with  the  greatest  danger  to  life,  consumed  by %0a%3c the  hardship  of  hunger  and  cold,  or  subjected  to  the %0a%3c weary  servitude  of  teachers,  and  altogether  worn  out %0a%3c by  the  desire  of  learning,  yet  acquire  with  intolerable %0a%3c labour,  covet  with  greedy  looks  this  "  book  op  various %0a%3c ARTS,*'  read  it  through  with  a  tenacious  memory,  em- %0a%3c brace it  with  an  ardent  love. %0a%3c %0a%3c Should  you  carefully  peruse  this,  you  will  there  find %0a%3c out  whatever  Greece  possesses  in  kinds  and  mixtures  of %0a%3c various  colours ;  whatever  Tuscany  knows  of  in  mosaic %0a%3c work,  or  in  variety  of  enamel ;  whatever  Arabia  shows %0a%3c forth  in  work  of  fusion,  ductility,  or  chasing ;  whatever %0a%3c Italy  ornaments  with  gold,  in  diversity  of  vases  and %0a%3c sculpture  of  gems  or  ivory ;  whatever  France  loves  in %0a%3c a  costly  variety  of  windows;  whatever  industrious %0a%3c Germany  approves  in  work  of  gold,  silver,  copper  and %0a%3c iron,  of  woods  and  of  stones. %0a%3c %0a%3c When  you  shall  have  re-read  this  often,  and  have %0a%3c committed  it  to  your  tenacious  memory,  you  shall  thus %0a%3c recompense  me  for  this  care  of  instruction,  that  as  often %0a%3c as  you  shall  successfully  have  made  use  of  my  work, %0a%3c you  pray  for  me  for  the  pity  of  Omnipotent  God,  who %0a%3c knows  that  I  have  written  these  things,  which  are  here %0a%3c arranged,  neither  through  love  of  human  approbation, %0a%3c nor  through  desire  of  temporal  reward,  nor  have  I %0a%3c stolen  anything  precious  or  rare  through  envious  jea- %0a%3c lousy, nor  have  I  kept  back  anything  reserved  for %0a%3c myself  alone ;  but  in  augmentation  of  the  honour  and %0a%3c glory  of  His  name,  I  have  consulted  the  progress  and %0a%3c hastened  to  aid  the  necessities  of  many  men. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BEBATA. %0a%3c %0a%3c Page  XXX,  line  9, /or  Vanri  hisiBelf,  read  Halyaaia. %0a%3c %0a%3c xzxiii,  line  8  of  note,  for  1  pound  Hthajge  (spigtlhari),  read  1  pound %0a%3c %0a%3c glass  (or  dear)  renn. %0a%3c Idem,  line  6, /or  litharge,  read  resin. %0a%3c 97,  line  30, /or  painting  oil,  read  preparing  oil. %0a%3c 101,  for  PanielinoB,  read  Panselinos. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c cuuji   1.
