I think you will want to read this.  I read every post you made and then have been thinking about this for a few days.  First I will say that I wish you posted the supps that your docs had you on.  I'm going to guess that selenium, zinc, Magnesium, vitamin D, B12 were in there.  I also would recommend riboflavin, vit e, vit k, and Retinol.   Now I'm sure you still want to know what is causing your headache but you also have tons of people piping up and making a fool of themselves.  Well I don't think I am going to do that.  But first I want to say that somehow your kinesiologist seems to have honed in on the truth.  To gently lead you in to what you have let me just say that I stumbled on this blog after searching for wormwood migraine.  This happened because my hypothesis was based on my understanding is that wormwood would help with them.  I think you have a pretty common type of migrane that just never went away.  I also suffer it slightly and mine is a 0-1/10 and is on about 50%25 of the time.  But I only got it when I started treating my head with diluted essential oils for parasites for a couple weeks straight because I felt crawling sensations, now I have semi-constant mild migraine.    =]%0a* [[NatureVault.GreatReset]]  . . .

Regulation of water on intake can be done with capillary tubes or even with an injector or steam in order to prevent the slag forming at the bottom from melted ash and water. Also instead of precisely sizing the nozzle, you can have a valve to adjust the flow on the fly.  Also a fine mesh cone at the bottom ofthe 55 gal drum would probably help the both processes, the carbonization and chargas generation.

Low density would be something like chemical free grass clippings or mulched (or crushed) fall leaves or wood chips.  Medium could be food scraps or chicken manure.  High would be finished compost ready to use.  High would earn you 3 tokens for example, medium 2 tokens, and low 1 token per bag.  Then for every say 4 tokens you can get 1 bag worth of finished compost at the community garden.  Or for every say 10 tokens you can get 10%25 off of a yearly or seasonal membership at the community garden.  Why would you trade a bag of finished compost for less than a bag of community garden compost?  Because the community compost will likely be much more rounded and have more diverse nutrients and plant DNA than what you provided.  Also it provides an incentive for the community garden to pick up your compost. =]%0a* [[NatureVault.Serpin]]  . . .

September 21, 2021, at 04:38 AM by ?: [=Outernet operates within the traditional internet just like cryptocurrency does.  The design is composed of three types of users.  Hosts, clients, and keymasters.  The host hosts the encrypted content.  Clients either view the content or upload it.  Keymasters decrypt the content.  Every user is known by a public key.  Instead of clients knowing the IP address they want to connect to, instead they broadcast what they are looking for, either a public key of the host or even a query they are searching for.  If a keymaster knows they have a decryption key for said website, they will offer the content to that user.  Then the keymaster will send along the decryption key to another keymaster and the new keymaster will listen for new requests.  Also the new keymaster sends a new OP address (which is a public key itself) to the public key of the web host as that new key is what they keymaster will sign for.  One very important thing here is the host should not be able to search for their public key and have a keymaster decrypt their site.  That would allow for censorship if the host could see what he was hosting.  So the only one who should know what a hosts public address is hosting should be the current keymaster for the site and the clients, host, or even other keymasters (even ones that have decrypted the site in the past) should not be able to link content to which host it is on. =]%0a* [[NatureVault.Psilocybin]]  . . .

May 24, 2021, at 11:08 AM by ?: [=One of PoW's most interesting functions is serving as a cryptographic decentralized clock. Referencing such clock times (blockhashes) in another cryptographic hash gives you proof that something was done no earlier than when that blockhash was created on the network.  In fact, our blockchainless [[Digital Collectible Network]] CollectBit uses a donor blockchain in order to keep time.  However about the fastest a PoW blockchain can provide timestamps currently is 15 seconds.  In the best case scenario this can never be much faster than 1.5 seconds (tick rate) since the speed of light is 0.15 seconds and a blockchain needs 10 times that relay time in order to work on a PoW solution to maintain under a roughly 10%25 orphan rate.  With PoHW, we broadcast all work done, as it is done, not just the solution to a block.  This allows for our minimum tick rate to be around the ping of the network itself, around 200ms currently.  So this increases the "tick rate" of our network by about 10-100x. =]%0a* [[NatureVault.Computers]]  . . .
