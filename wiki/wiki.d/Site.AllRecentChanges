Sometimes these less harmful bacteria can out compete harmful ones leading to a checks and balance system that can be helpful if you do not have access to [[medicine]] ([[herbs]]). Otherwise with a handful of herbs you would be much better off than infecting yourself with bacteria, and all bacteria cause side effets.
