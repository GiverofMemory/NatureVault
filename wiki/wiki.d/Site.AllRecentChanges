These will not only help make the water not get infected but also act as a worm preventative and increase growth and feed conversion and resilient health.  There is no reason not to do it all the time, once a month is definitely not enough to keep humans or animals healthy.  If you are using dr bronners add a little cinnamon, lavender/peppermint, thyme essential oil to the soap, shake it up, and use that in place of just the dr bronners but you should give probiotics too. =]%0a* [[NatureVault.5G]]  . . . @@**26 Apr 2023 02:34 UTC**@@ by ?: [=millimeter waves at the upper end of the spectrum, around 30 ghz requires a spectrum analyzer to measure [[https://mitometer.com/does-the-mito-meter-pick-up-5g-2/|#]] [[https://mitometer.com/#product-row|#]] =]%0a
