The more manual and slower the tilling, the less damage to beneficial worms and also other insect larvae like fireflies and others.  Eventually the biointensive plots will be rich and loose enough to not require turning the soil at all.  #Genetics should be wild, native, naturalized, landrace, and heirloom, in that order of importance.  #In practice biointensive plots will usually be annual crops as this allows for simpler maintainance and management of the plots, however biointensive is also probably the best method for perennial crops as well.
