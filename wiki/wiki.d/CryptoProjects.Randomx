I am curious as to your thoughts about my parameter selection and if it would hurt or help CPU vs ASIC or even GPU implementations. My gut is that very smart people writing GPU miners on AI type graphics cards with tons of L3 cache might be responsible for the rapidly increasing hashrate on the monero network, and probably not stealth asic design as the slope of hashrate increase has been similar since the introduction of RandomX - leading me to believe optimizations have continually been made in secret.%0a%0aSo not just for my benefit but also for potential future RandomX parameter changes on monero, if we wanted to target Servers for mining (tons of ram and cache) and could use reasonably fast desktops for verification, would these parameters achieve meaningful GPU and ASIC resistance (currently)? Also the parameter of superscalar latency should it be moved more memory or compute bound for this application or should it stay balanced between the two?%0a%0aHere is the parameter config. https://github.com/GiverofMemory/RandomX/blob/master/doc/configuration.md%0a%0aI'm not looking for a free audit, I know I still need to fix calculations for unsafe parameters but just looking for a general assesment especially of cache and memory requirements and program size,iterations, and count. Also if a CPU doesn't have enough cache for the entire scratchpads would that hurt it less than it would hurt a GPU or ASIC if they were similarly limited on on-chip memory? Also I'm assuming that anything that can't fit in L1 would automaically go to the next fastest memory like L2 etc, correct?%0a%0aAlso I'm not really worried about hashing speed (as long as a good server can get multiple hashes per second) or verification times as nodes could also be servers or decent desktops, but is this too naive in that I am missing something critical?%0a%0aPS: just to enter the fray I believe shelby3's conflict of interest is he wants to be vindicated for giving up on his randomized PoW idea in 2013. But to be fair he is right that so far he is basically batting 1000 in the hypothesis that ASIC resistance will always be broken for a static algorithm. My counter to that is...it is much easier for someone to change parameters with literally 2 clicks and a scheduled fork than to update an asic design to address the new parameters ;). @]
