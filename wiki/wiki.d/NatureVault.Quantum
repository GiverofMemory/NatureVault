If there is a lower pressure of the media in one area, surrounding pieces will move to equalize the pressure for example.  A perfectly quantum media cannot be moved or pushed or otherwise provide a reactionary force.  Only by de-quantumizing the media locally can a reaction force be sustained by the quantum media.  "De-quantumizing" the quantum mediam so it can sustain a greater reactionary force can be called "[[quantaclast]]" technology.
