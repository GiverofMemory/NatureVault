text=Heaven and Earth %0a%0a%0a%0a151. Rabbi Shimon opened and said, "In the beginning the Creator created %0athe Heavens and the earth." This verse should be examined carefully, for %0awhoever claims that there is another Creator disappears from the world, as it is %0awritten, "He who claims that there is another Creator perishes from both the %0aearth and from Heavens, for there is no other Creator, but the Almighty." %0a%0aHere The Zohar continues to discuss the correction of the bride. It starts %0awith the first sentence of the Torah: IN THE BEGINNING THE CREATOR %0aCREATED, with the root and the source of all the corrections of the bride %0a(Malchut) during the 6,000 years. %0a%0aMalchut's entire correction occurs only through her union with Bina and %0athe reception of Bina's properties. In the verse, IN THE BEGINNING THE %0aCREATOR CREATED, the Creator is called Elokim, signifying Bina. This means %0athat He created the world by the property of Bina for the purpose of correction. %0a%0aElokim consists of MI-Bina and ELEH-Malchut. Thanks to the constant %0aunion of MI and ELEH, the world can exist. The Creator is Bina, called Elokim, %0aand as a result of Ohr Hochma clothing in Ohr Hassadim, the union of MI and %0aELEH provides ELEH with the property of Bina. It is through this correction %0athat the world is able to exist. %0a%0aThe union of MI and ELEH does not permit for the existence of other, %0aforeign, egoistic forces within the Partzuf. These are the so-called "other gods," %0awho cannot sustain the world, as they separate MI from ELEH and do not clothe %0athe Light of pleasure (Hochma) in the altruistic intention of Hassadim (for the %0aCreator's sake), which leads to Ohr Hochma departing the Partzuf, leaving ELEH. %0aTherefore, it is forbidden to believe that man is governed by any other forces %0abesides the Creator, for instead of existence and reception of the Light of Life, %0asuch belief brings the world and man only ruin and disappearance of this Light. %0a%0a315 %0a%0a%0a%0a316 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0a152. With the exception of ELEH, everything is written in Aramaic. This is %0acalled "translation." He asks: However, should you suggest that it is because %0athe holy angels do not understand the translation, i.e., the Aramaic language, %0athen everything should have been said in Hebrew, so the holy angels would %0ahear and be grateful for it. He replies: This is exactly why it is written in the %0atranslation (in Aramaic), as the holy angels neither hear nor understand it, %0aand hence will not envy people, which would be detrimental to the latter. For %0ain this case, even the holy angels are called Creators, and they are included in %0athe group of Creators, but they have not created Heaven and earth. %0a%0aAramaic is referred to as "translation." It is very close to the holy language of %0aHebrew, but angels neither need nor know it nonetheless. Yet, they know and need %0aall the other languages of the nations of the world. This is so because the transla- %0ation from the holy language is called its "reverse side," its VAK without GAR. %0a%0aIn other words, there is an altruistic language, which is hence called "holy," %0aand its reverse, preliminary stage, hence called "translation," is the Aramaic %0alanguage. No other language in the world but Aramaic can act as translation %0afrom the holy language. All the other languages in the nations of the world %0a(egoistic desires) are strictly egoistic and are unrelated to altruism. They are not %0aAHP with regard to GE (the holy language). %0a%0aTherefore, the translation is truly close to the holy language. However, %0athere is one distinction here, which renders it unnecessary to angels: the holy %0alanguage is like the scale pointer that shows the extent of balance between %0athe right and left scales, where the pointer moves between the two scales and %0adelivers its judgment— toward the scale of reward (for merits) or towards the scale %0aof punishment (for sins). It brings everything back to the state of correction, to %0apurity and holiness, and is hence called the holy language ("Introduction to The %0aStudy of Ten Sefirot," item 120). %0a%0aAs it is written in item sixteen, Heaven, earth, and all that inhabit them %0awere created by MA, i.e., Malchut, as it is written, "MA = WHAT = HOW %0aglorious is Your name in all the earth, which You have set above the Heavens!" %0aIndeed, Heaven was created by the name (property) of MA (Malchut), whereas %0athe Heaven that is mentioned alludes to Bina, called ML But all is explained by %0athe name Elokim. %0a%0aThe name Elokim is revealed in Heaven and earth, which were created by the %0apower of MA, by attaching the letters ELEH from Ima-Bina with the help of MAN %0aand good deeds of the lower ones. Therefore, the Light of GAR, i.e., Ohr Hochma, %0acalled Elokim, is consistent neither in Heaven (Bina) nor on earth (ZON). %0a%0a%0a%0aHeaven and Earth %0a%0a%0a%0a317 %0a%0a%0a%0aTypically, only GE are present above the Parsa, in ZON of the world of %0aAtzilut, whereas their AHP is below the Parsa, in the worlds BYA, for ZON %0athemselves are unwilling to receive Ohr Hochma unless it is to be passed on to %0athe Partzufim— the souls of the righteous— in the worlds of BYA. %0a%0aWhen the lower ones, the righteous that exist spiritually in the worlds of BYA, %0araise MAN from below upwards, from their place in BYA to Malchut de Atzilut, %0aMA turns into MI and the letters ELEH join with MI. Together, they create the %0aword Elokim, which is the Light of Heaven and earth. However, if the lower ones %0acorrupt their deeds by sinking into egoistic intentions, the Light disappears and %0aleaves Sefirot K-H with the Light Ruach-Nefesh (called MI or MA), while the letters %0aELEH fall into the impure forces, for MI is GE and ELEH is AHP. %0a%0aTherefore, the entire correction depends exclusively on attaching the letters %0aELEH to MI with the help of MAN. Hence, this correction is called the "holy %0alanguage," like the scale pointer, which determines the balance between egoistic %0adesires and altruistic intentions, i.e., the reception for the Creator's sake. This is %0awhy the scale pointer is set in the middle, and by means of such interaction of %0athe properties of Malchut (the will to receive) and Bina (the will to bestow), one %0acan achieve the reception of Ohr Hochma for the Creator's sake. %0a%0aThe Light is called "holy," as it passes the holy name Elokim to ZON, descends %0afrom Bina to ZON, and transfers the letters ELEH to the pure and holy side, to %0athe scale of merit. This is why the Hebrew word for "scales" is Mawznaim (from %0athe word Awzen), for the Light in AHP {Awzen-Hotem-Peh) is named according to %0aits highest Light, the Light of Awzen of the Sefira Bina or Ohr Neshama. %0a%0aKeter - Galgalta - Forehead/Skull - Yechida %0aHochma - Eynaim - eyes - Haya %0a%0aParsa %0a%0aBina - Awzen - ear - Neshama %0a%0aZA - Hotem - nose - Ruach \ AHP %0a%0aMalchut - Peh - mouth - Nefesh ) %0a%0aAnd the language of translation called Targum is opposite to the holy %0alanguage of Mawznaim (scales). It is so because when the lower ones do not raise %0aMAN and do not harbor pure intentions, it is defined as an aspiration to use %0aonly the desires to receive, designated by the letters ELEH, and which do not %0aaspire to unite with the desire (property) of bestowal (the letters MI-Bina). As a %0a%0a%0a%0a%0a318 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aresult, AHP of ZON, called MA, descend and Heaven and earth (ZON) return %0ato the state of VAK. %0a%0aSuch a state is called the language of Targum. The Gematria of the word %0aTardema (sleep) matches that of the word Targum. In Hebrew, the word Targum is %0aspelled with the same letters as the words Tered MA, which means "descending %0aMA," for through this spiritually impure language, AHP = MA (designated %0aby the words Tered MA) becomes revealed. This leads to the descent from the %0ascale of merit to the scale of punishment. While this is happening, the state %0aof GE is called "sleep." %0a%0aHowever, all this refers only to ZON, to Heaven and earth created in MA, %0athe desires of reception. This is because they have emerged as a result of a Zivug %0aon Yesod, called MA. But the holy angels that emerged from the Zivug de Neshikin %0a(kissing Zivug) of AVI, and which have only MI but no MA (only altruistic desires %0aof bestowal, the property of IMA-Bina), permanently exist in the state of VAK %0awithout GAR, that is, without Ohr Hochma. %0a%0aOn the other hand, their VAK is Ohr Hassadim of MI = Ima-Bina. Ohr %0aHassadim in Bina is as important as GAR, for it fills desires with just as perfect %0aa sensation as does the GAR, to the point that they reject Ohr Hochma, just like %0aIma. And there is holiness in them; hence, GAR are called holy, as well. %0a%0aThere are two reasons why angels do not respond to the language of Targum, %0awhich adds MA to ZON and returns ZON to the state of VAK: %0a%0a1. Even when ZON are in the state of GAR due to the influence of the %0aholy language, angels do not receive GAR (Hochma) from it, as, just %0alike Ima, they want only Ohr Hassadim. %0a%0a2. The addition of the Achoraim (AHP) does not apply to angels whatsoever; %0a%0athey lack the properties of MA. Hence, The Zohar says that THE HOLY %0aANGELS HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO NEED for translation AND %0aDO NOT LISTEN to it. They do not need it because they neither %0alose anything when it is present nor gain anything when it is absent, %0aas they constitute the property of VAK and lack the property of MA. %0a%0aAND THEY SHALL NOT ENVY MAN-this sentence refers primarily to %0athe damnation of other gods, the forces that prevent man from revealing GAR, %0aOhr Hochma. As a result, he loses the Light and the letters ELEH, for angels do %0anot have the properties of GAR de Hochma either, but only GAR de Hassadim. %0aThus, they feel ashamed of their descent to such a low degree, and envy us for %0aconsidering ourselves significant. %0a%0a%0a%0aHeaven and Earth %0a%0a%0a%0a319 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar says that in this case, even the holy angels are called "Creators," %0abut they have not created Heaven and earth and are called "Creators-Elokim" %0a(forces) because they come from Ima-Bina (called Elokim), thus existing in the %0ageneral Elokim. But THEY HAVE NOT CREATED HEAVEN AND EARTH, %0afor they cannot uphold the existence of Heaven and earth in GAR de Hochma. %0aHowever, Heaven and earth (the correction of the world to its ultimate merging %0awith the Creator) cannot exist unless man settles there (man must consist of %0aegoistic and altruistic desires) and sows and reaps (corrects his egoistic desires by %0auniting with the properties of Bind). This existence is possible only in the Light %0aof GAR de Hochma (the reception of Ohr Hochma for the Creator's sake). Hence, %0aangels do not create Heaven and earth. %0a%0a153. He asks: earth is called Arka, when it should read, Ar'a. He answers: %0abecause Arka is one of the seven lands below, where the sons of Cain's sons %0areside. Indeed, after being banished from the face of the earth, they descended %0athere and fathered generations; wisdom became so lost that all understanding %0awas lost, and this is a double land, consisting of darkness and Light. %0a%0aEach of the seven Sefirot (the six Sefirot of ZA and Malchut) contain the %0aproperties of the other six. Thus, each one of them contains the seven Sefirot %0aHGT NHYM. In other words, Malchut, too, has seven Sefirot, and the lower %0aworld contains seven lands, as well, called Eretz, Adama, Arka, Gia, Neshia, %0aTzia and level. %0a%0aOur land is called Tevel and is the highest of the seven lands. Arka is the %0athird of the seven lands. The souls of Cain and Abel descend from the word %0aElokim, but due to the impurity that Chava (Eve), Adam's wife, received from %0athe serpent, the soul of Cain emerged first from the letters ELEH, followed %0aby the soul of Abel, which emerged from the letters ML These two Partzufim %0awere meant to unite and incorporate their properties in one another, which %0awould make the name Elokim shine in both of them, as when MI is permanently %0apresent in ELEH. However, the impure force that emerged together with Cain's %0asoul incited him against his brother (MI of the word Elokim) to the point that he %0arose against Abel (MI in Elokim) and slew him. This is because the disappearance %0aof the property of MI-Bina from ELEH is tantamount to murder. %0a%0aWithout the support of the properties of MI, ELEH (Cain's own property) %0afell into the impure forces: from the spiritual level of the holy land to the impure %0aplace (of egoistic desires). And he lost his descendants (Partzufim filled with Light) %0abecause of the rule of the impure forces (the disappearance of the screen). %0a%0a%0a%0a320 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aThus, the holy language within him was substituted for translation, for he %0ahad lost the wisdom (Ohr Hochma). After all, the impure forces lack wisdom, as %0athey have only the Light of HB without Daat. %0a%0aThe slaying of Abel, i.e., the exit of Light from this Partzuf (item 152), occurs %0abecause MI is formed in ZON exclusively by the power of MAN (raised by the pure %0athoughts of the righteous in the worlds of BYA). Then appear the letters ELEH, %0aand the word Elokim becomes as complete in ZON as it is in AVI. Malchut ends just %0alike ZA, like Ima, due to the replacing of the letter Hey with Yod (item 17). %0a%0aHowever, the letter He;y does not disappear from MA forever. Rather, it %0asimply enters the inner part of Malchut and hides there (the will to receive %0areceives its fulfillment from altruistic actions, from Ohr Hassadim. Hence, its %0aegoistic aspirations are temporarily unfelt, as they are concealed in Ohr Hassadim). %0aMeanwhile, the letter Yod is revealed in ML %0a%0aThis is why the Creator's holy name Elokim is also found in ZON, in Heaven %0aand earth. However, Cain raised MAN not in holiness and purity, but wished %0ato use the letters ELEH— which relate to him— for his own pleasure. This is %0adescribed as, AND CAIN ROSE UP AGAINST ABEL, HIS BROTHER, for he %0aput himself above his brother, to rule over MI (Abel). %0a%0aHowever, AHP of Nukva (the hitherto concealed letter Hey of MA) were %0aimmediately revealed, and the word MI disappeared from Malchut. Hence, %0aAbel's soul, which stems from MI of NuLua (MI fill the Partzuf with Light and are %0aconsidered its soul) ascends and disappears as well, as is described by the words, %0aAND SLEW HIM, for the Light's exit from the Partzuf is referred to as death. %0a%0aThis is why The Zohar describes this process in the following way: The %0aserpent's impure force was within Cain (Beresheet, 2:4); hence, he wished to %0astrengthen the letters ELEH, annul MI, and govern them. That is why he revealed %0aAHP of Nukva (MA) and MI disappeared from Nukva, whereupon Abel's soul, %0awhich descends from MI, disappeared as well (AND SLEW HIM). %0a%0aThus, Cain himself (ELEH) fell under the rule of the impure forces, called %0aArka or Eretz Nod, as it is written in the Torah: "And he settled in the land of %0aNod" (Beresheet, 4:16). %0a%0aThe Zohar calls it a double land, one that contains both Light and darkness. %0aThis is because Light and darkness mix and act (rule) together, as there are two %0arulers in that land, who divide the power equally between them. One rules over %0adarkness, the other over Light. Hence, in this state one is unable to separate %0aLight from darkness, and only help from Above, the descending Light of reason, %0aenables one to tell between the true Ruler and the lord of darkness. %0a%0a%0a%0aHeaven and Earth %0a%0a%0a%0a321 %0a%0a%0a%0a154. And there are two rulers there— one rules over darkness and one over %0aLight, and they become hostile to each other. When Cain descended there, %0athey joined together and became complete. And they all saw that they were %0aCain's descendants. Therefore, their two heads are like two serpents, except %0afor when the ruler of Light defeats the other, the ruler of darkness. Hence, %0athey enter Light and darkness, and become as one. %0a%0aWe need to review item 14, which expounds on the creation of the holy %0aname Elokim. First, the letters ELEH ascend and join MI to form a simple %0aword, since Ohr Hassadim is still insufficient, whereas holiness (Ohr Hochma) %0acannot enter the Kli (desire) without being clothed in Ohr Hassadim. Hence, it %0ais concealed in the name Elokim. %0a%0aThat is why a Zivug takes place in MI— to receive Ohr Hassadim, which clothes %0aOhr Hochma, thereby correcting the name Elokim: Ml BARAH ELEH— BARAH %0ais the source of Ohr Hassadim, which clothes Ohr Hochma, thus connecting MI %0ato ELEH, which brings correction to the name Elokim. MI-Bina consists of GAR %0a(AVI with the property of pure altruism), who never receive Ohr Hochma, and %0aZAT (YESHSUT), who do receive Ohr Hochma. %0a%0aTherefore, as the letters ELEH begin to ascend to MI, they first rise to ZAT %0ade Ml (YESHSUT), who receive Ohr Hochma, but are currently concealed in the %0aname Elokim. Then transpires the second Zivug on GAR de Ml, AVI, altruistic %0adesires, which provide ELEH with Ohr Hassadim, thus bringing correction to %0athe name Elokim. %0a%0aAVI - GARdeBina - Ohr Hassadim %0a%0aYESHSUT - ZATdeBina - Ohr Hochma %0aZON %0a%0aSince ELEH lacks Ohr Hassadim, those deprived from Ohr Hochma are called %0aPartzuf Cain. Not only did Cain fail to raise MAN to receive MI with Hassadim, %0ahe also wished to receive Ohr Hochma from AVI, thereby destroying the Partzuf %0anamed Abel, for the egoistic desires of AHP de Malchut of Atzilut were exposed. %0aThe Light disappeared from Partzuf Abel, signifying its death, whereas Cain %0ahimself fell into the impure forces— ELEH. %0a%0aThe place of these impure forces is called Arka. Also, two rulers exist there, %0aemerging from the impure ELEH: when AHP de MA in Malchut is concealed, %0awhile AHP de Ml are revealed, they can pass the Light from the perfect, %0apure, and holy name Elokim to the souls. Ohr Hochma of ELEH (received by %0a%0a%0a%0a322 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aYESHSUT) then clothes in Hassadim (received from AVI), and the holy name %0aElokim becomes revealed. %0a%0aHowever, since the impure forces cling only to the AHP of the pure forces %0a(to MA), the letters ELEH within them exist in two incomplete states: (i) when %0ano Hassadim are present at all; (ii) when Ohr Hochma in ELEH cannot clothe in %0aHassadim due to the lack of Hassadim de Ml; hence, ELEH are kept in darkness. %0a%0aThis is the male part of the impure ELEH, as these Kelim are intended for %0aOhr Hochma. However, they have no Hochma due to the lack of Hassadim de ML %0aHence, they are kept in darkness, devoid of both Hochma and Hassadim. Yet, %0athese are great Kelim, for if they had been able to receive Ohr Hassadim, they %0awould have been able to receive Ohr Hochma within it, too. %0a%0aThe female part of the impure ELEH stems from AHP de MA of the holy %0aNukva, the Kli for Ohr Hassadim. However, the impure Nukva is considerably %0ainjured, as she is the basis for everyone's remoteness from the Creator, as she %0aimpersonates the holy Malchut. Depending on the extent of her corruption, %0ashe has a multitude of impure names. Yet, she still retains a tiny Light (Ner %0aDakik), since her Kelim stem from AHP de MA, the roots of which are Kelim %0aof Ohr Hassadim. %0a%0aThese male and female parts of the impure ELEH are ZA and Malchut of %0athe impure forces, the two rulers in Arka. The male part rules over darkness %0aand the female part rules over the Light that is there. They complain against %0aeach another, since they are opposite. The male part complains because it is the %0aKelim of the letters ELEH, which are empty of Ohr Hochma; it hates the forces %0aof remoteness from the Creator and forgery, existing within the Kelim of the %0afemale part of the impure forces, and prefers to remain in its darkness. %0a%0aNukva of the impure forces, however, who has a small Light of Hassadim, %0adoes not aspire for Ohr Hochma, let alone for the darkness in which her male %0apart abides. Therefore, she complains about the male part and distances from %0ait. As The Zohar says, two rulers govern there: one (the male part) over darkness, %0aand the other (the female part) over Light, and they are hostile towards each %0aother, for the male part rules over darkness and the female rules over Light. %0aHence, they hate, slander, and complain against each other. And since they are %0athereby distanced from one another, they cannot expand their dominance and %0aare incapable of causing any harm. %0a%0aHowever, after Cain had sinned and dropped the pure letters of ELEH of %0ahis soul into the impure forces of Arka, his ELEH, which are concealed from %0aHassadim, clothed in the tiny Light present in the impure forces. This revives %0a%0a%0a%0aHeaven and Earth %0a%0a%0a%0a323 %0a%0a%0a%0athe small Kelim de Hochma in Cain's ELEH, for the Light of the impure forces %0abestows life upon them, just like the pure Light of Hassadim. %0a%0aAs a result, the male part of ELEH of the impure forces, too, made a Zivug %0awith this Nukva, who clothed Cain's ELEH, since he has these Kelim, as well. %0aWith the help of this Zivug, Cain fathered his descendants, the sparks of Ohr %0aHochma that remain in the letters ELEH, which are not mixed with the male %0aimpure Kelim of ELEH that clothed in the Light of Nukva of the impure forces. %0a%0aThis is why The Zohar says that when Cain descended there, everything %0amerged and became complete, for the sparks of Ohr Hochma that remained %0ain Cain's ELEH were clothed in the Light of Nukva of the impure forces. %0aConsequently, her male impure force wished to enjoy the sparks of Ohr Hochma %0athat are in Cain's ELEH. %0a%0aHence, they made a Zivug, i.e., spread and completed one another, and %0aeveryone saw that they were the descendants of Cain, that this Zivug produced %0athe descendants, the clothing of the sparks of Ohr Hochma in Cain's impure %0aELEH. Thus, the sparks of Ohr Hochma of Cain's soul were revealed, and %0aeveryone saw that they were Cain's descendants, born of a vile Zivug. %0a%0aTherefore, their two heads are like two serpents, for they were born from %0aa union of the male and female parts of the impure ELEH, which are initially %0aopposite to one another. Therefore, Cain's descendants have two heads, from %0athe two impure forces: one craves the darkness of the desires to receive Ohr %0aHochma, and the other craves the Light within the impure desires of the impure %0aNukva. And the two serpent heads correspond to the two animals that belong to %0athe system of the pure forces: the bull and the eagle. %0a%0aHowever, the two heads exist only when the male part is dominant, when %0adarkness rules. Indeed, by clothing in the Light of ~Nukva in order to enjoy the %0asmall sparks of Ohr Hochma, the male part also supports (against its will) the %0adominance of its Nukva, for it wants her Light. As a result, their descendants %0ahave two heads: the first pulls in one direction and the second in another. %0a%0aNukva of the impure forces does not need their male part whatsoever, as %0aher male part exists in darkness and cannot give her anything. Therefore, Nukva %0adominates and prevails in her impurity, leaving nothing of the properties of the %0amale part. Consequently, Cain's two-headed descendants become one-headed. %0a%0aThe Zohar tells us that the ruler of Light defeats the lord of darkness. When %0athe impure Nukva, which has the Light, dominates, she defeats the male impure %0apart, as well as the other male ruler. She defeats the male part, fully subduing it %0ato her rule, and they include themselves in her Light and darkness, and become %0a%0a%0a%0a324 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aas one. Consequently, the rule of the male part (darkness) is included under the %0arule of the female part (Light), and the two heads become one. %0a%0a155. For these are the two rulers, called Afrira and Kastimon, who resemble %0aholy angels with six wings. One has the image of a bull, and the other of an %0aeagle. And when they unite, they create an image of man. %0a%0aThe male impure force is called Kastimon (from the word Kosti, devastation), %0afor it is darkness and is unfit for man's life. And the impure Nukva, the female %0apart, is called Afrira (from the word Afar, dust), and is unfit for sowing. She is %0acalled so in order to show that although she contains Light, she is insufficient %0afor sowing the seed and producing harvest to feed human beings. %0a%0aThe Zohar also says that she resembles holy angels with six wings, for the six %0awings of the holy angels correspond to the letter Vav in the name HaVaYaH. In %0acontrast, there are only four wings in the impure forces, corresponding to the %0aname ADM, indicating the height of the impure forces with regard to the holy %0aangels, opposite them. %0a%0aThe Upper Light is called "wine," bringing joy to the Creator and to human %0abeings. However, wine residue contains Sigim or wine yeast. And from this waste %0aemerges the foremost wrecker of the world, for he is still connected to purity %0a(to yeast) and has the image of a man. However, as he descends to bring people %0aharm, he assumes the image of a bull. This is why a bull is the first of the four %0amain types of wrecker. %0a%0aHence, The Zohar tells us that Kastimon is a wrecker in the image of a bull, %0athus indicating that it is the basis of all wreckers that are called "the impure bull." %0aIt is the Sigim of the Supernal Ohr Hochma of the holy name Elokim, the impure %0aELEH that correspond to the pure ELEH of the name Elokim. For Sigim and %0ayeast stand below it, but since it is still connected to purity, it has the image of %0aman, for Ohr Hochma of the name Elokim is T^elem (image and likeness) of man, %0aof which it is said: "Be T^elem Elokim— created man in image and likeness." %0a%0aYet, when separated from purity (altruism) through deterioration of its %0adesires and, consequently, of its properties, it descends to its place (befitting %0athese properties) in Arka, and assumes the image (properties) of a bull. And its %0aNukva assumes (in Arka) the form (properties) of an eagle, in congruence with %0aher goal and action of Linshor (to fall out)— to bring about the fall of human %0asouls under her power. %0a%0aHence, the word Nesher (vulture) is derived from the word Neshira (fall), just %0aas leaves fall from a tree, for the role of the impure Nukva is to seek people out %0a%0a%0a%0aHeaven and Earth %0a%0a%0a%0a325 %0a%0a%0a%0aand bring them to a state of night and darkness, to the destruction of the holy %0acovenant, as a result of which people's souls depart from them (item 131). %0a%0aTherefore, The Zohar tells us: "And when they unite, they form the image of %0aman," i.e., if they return and unite with purity, existing as wine yeast, they return %0aand assume once more the image of man, just as before they descended to Arka %0aand became wreckers. %0a%0a156. When they are covered with darkness, they turn into a serpent with two %0aheads, and move like a serpent. They soar in the void and bathe in the Great %0aSea, and when they approach the chains of Aza and Azael, they rile and rouse %0athem and leap into the mountains of darkness, thinking that the Creator %0awishes to bring justice upon them. %0a%0aI suggest that the reader will try to comment on The Zohar on his own, %0awithout any help, and then compare his thoughts with those stated below. This %0away, we might understand what Rabbi Yehuda Ashlag has done for us with his %0acommentary. Prior to the appearance of his commentaries on the books of the %0aARI and The Zohar, there was no way for us to understand Kabbalah correctly, %0aonly a handful of people in each generation could climb the spiritua %0aler on their own. %0a%0aNow, however, I assure the reader that simply by constantly reading eve %0aks, which retell the compositions of the great Kabbalists, Rabbi Ashlag %0ahis elder son and my teacher, Rabbi Baruch Ashlag, anyone can attain ascension %0ato the Creator. I think that those who have already read previous books realize %0athat this is truly possible! %0a%0aAs The Zohar already mentioned in item 154, when the impure Nukva %0adominates man through her Light, the two heads become as one. However, in %0athe darkness, when the male part, called Kastimon, dominates, they turn into %0aa serpent with two heads, for the male part is unable to annul the power of the %0afemale part, as it needs to be clothed in her Light. Hence, the serpent has two %0aheads. And they move like a serpent— aiming to bring harm (the property of the %0aserpent), to tempt Chava to dine on the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge. %0a%0aBy the power of the Rosh of the impure Nukva they soar in the void, which %0acontains the root of the impure force, called "void" or the greatest fall, as it %0ais written: "They ascended up to Heaven, they descended down to the abyss" %0a(Tehilim, 107:26). By the power of the impure male part, they bathe in the Great %0aSea, in Ohr Hochma of the impure forces. %0a%0a%0a%0a326 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aTherefore, Arka is called the Land of Nod, as it constantly sways from the %0arule of the two heads: those that reside there keep alternating between ascending %0aup to the Great Sea and descending down into the void. %0a%0aThe angels Aza and Azael are very exalted angels. Indeed, even after they %0ahad fallen from Heaven into our world, into the mountains of darkness, linked %0aby a metal chain, so great was their power that with their help Bil'am (Balaam) %0aattained the degree of prophecy, of which it is written: "Sees the Creator's %0apresence" (Bamidbar, 24:4). %0a%0aThis is described as "falls and opens his eyes," for Aza is referred to as %0a"falling" because of his fall from Heaven to earth. And Azael is called "he who %0aopens his eyes" with regard to Aza, at whose face the Creator throws darkness. %0aAnd with regard to Bil'am's prophetic degree, our sages have said the following: %0a"There has not been a prophet in Israel like Moshe, not in Israel, but there was %0aone among the nations of the world, and his name was Bil'am" (Bamidbar-Raba, %0a14)— so great was his prophetic degree. %0a%0aAnd the reason for their downfall from Heaven to earth lies in their %0acomplaints against man at the moment of his making. Yet, there were many %0aangels complaining and objecting, so why did the Creator cast down only these %0atwo? The answer to this question can be found in items 416-425 of the chapter %0a"Balak" in The Zohar. Briefly, it says that when the desire to create Adam (or %0aman, since the Hebrew word for man is Adam) appeared in the Creator, He %0asummoned the Supernal angels, seated them before Him, and told them of His %0adesire to create man. %0a%0aThe angels replied: "What is man, that You are mindful of him?" (Tehilim, %0a8:5), meaning what are the properties of this man that You so wish to create? He %0areplied to them: "This man will be similar to Me and his wisdom will surpass %0ayours, for the human soul includes all the angels and Supernal Degrees, just as %0ahis body includes all the creatures of this world." %0a%0aTherefore, at the moment of creation of man's soul, the Creator summoned %0aall the Supernal angels, so they would pass all of their properties and forces %0ato man's soul. It is therefore written: "Let us make man in our image, in our %0alikeness," meaning that man's "image and likeness" includes all of the properties %0aof all the angels. %0a%0aThe words "image and likeness" are written in quotation marks, since the %0awords Tzelem and Demut (image and likeness) are not mere words that simply %0adescribe likeness. Rather, they constitute very meaningful spiritual notions. %0a%0a%0a%0aHeaven and Earth %0a%0a%0a%0a327 %0a%0a%0a%0aBut the angels' question should be interpreted as follows: "What kind of a %0acreature is this man and what is his nature? How shall we benefit from passing %0a(including) our properties in him?" The Creator replied to this: "This man %0awill be similar to Me and his wisdom will surpass yours." In other words, the %0aCreator thus promised them that man will embrace all of their qualities (the %0aproperties of Tzelem), and that he will be wiser than them. However, because of %0atheir connection to him, they will also benefit from his great attainments and %0aacquire everything that they presently lack. %0a%0aThis is because the human soul includes all the spiritual degrees and all the %0autmost properties of all the angels. And just as his body includes all the materials %0aand creatures of our world with all of their properties, so was the Creator's wish %0athat his soul would absorb the whole of creation within it. %0a%0aIt is written in the Torah: "Yaakov and Israel shall be told of the Creator's %0aworks (Bamidbar, 23:23)." The sages have said that in the future the angels will %0aask Israel for things that they do not know themselves, for Israel's attainments %0awill be beyond that of the angels. Hence, all the angels took part in the creation %0aof man and integrated all their properties within him. %0a%0aHowever, once man was created and sinned, thus becoming guilty before the %0aCreator, the angels Aza and Azael appeared before the Creator with accusations %0a"that man, whom You have created, has sinned before You." For these words, %0athe Creator cast them down from their exalted and holy degree, and thus, they %0abegan to deceive human beings. %0a%0aOf all the angels, only these two, Aza and Azael, came before the Creator %0ato complain about Adam's sins, for only they knew that man shall return to %0athe Creator. However, Aza and Azael also knew that the harm brought to them %0aby man's sin will not be corrected by this return. Moreover, they would prefer %0aman to not return in his desires to the Creator at all. This is why they were the %0aonly ones that complained about Adam's sin, because from their perspective, %0athis sin is incorrigible. %0a%0aThe thing is that the breaking of the vessels and Adam's sin constitute the %0asame breaking, disappearance of the screen (anti-egoistic willpower or intention %0ato act for the Creator's sake). The difference is that the breaking of the vessels %0asignifies the breaking of the screen in the Partzuf called "world," while Adam's %0asin is the breaking, disappearance of the screen in the Partzuf called "soul." %0aThe difference between these two Partzufim is that the Partzuf called "world" is %0aexternal with regard to the inner Partzuf called "soul." The soul exists within the %0aworld and is sustained by it. %0a%0a%0a%0a328 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aThe breaking has its causes and consequences. It is necessary for mixing %0aall the properties of Bina and Malchut, and must transpire both in the spiritual %0aworld and within the soul, to impart the properties of Bina to Malchut, and thus %0aenable her to correct herself. %0a%0aThe breaking of the world of Nekudim led to the breaking of the eight %0aSefirot Hesed-Gevura-2/3 of Tifferet and 1/3 of Tifferet-Netzah-Hod-Yesod-Malchut, %0afour Sefirot H-B-ZA-M in each one that in turn consists of ten Sefirot, in all: %0a8 x 4 x 10 = 320 (SHACH) parts. As a result of the mixing of all the parts, %0aeach part in turn consists of 320 parts. All of these 320 parts, called Nitzotzin %0a(sparks), acquired the egoistic will to enjoy by receiving the Creator's Light, %0awhich signifies their descent into the impure forces. %0a%0a%0a%0a/ision the reception of lower properties as a descent, the reception of %0aspiritual properties as an ascent, the attainment of equivalence of forr %0aunion, and the emergence of a new property as separation. The appearance %0aof egoistic desires in a spiritual object is considered a descent into the impure %0aforces, although these forces exist within us (and not vice versa), and simply %0a)me more apparent. There is nothing surrounding us, for everything %0athe worlds and desires, both pure and impure. %0a%0aBy studying Kabbalah we attract the emanation of the Light that surr %0ail (see "Introduction to The Study of Ten Sefirot," item 155), %0a;s within us a desire for correction. Then, as we attain the degrees o %0aspiritual worlds, we begin to feel the spiritual Light that corresponds to each %0adegree, through which we begin to discern egoistic and altruistic parts in each %0aof our properties. %0a%0aBy comparisons to the Light, we perceive our egoistic parts as evil, and to %0athe extent that we sense it, we distance ourselves from it and refuse to use these %0adesires. Conversely, we perceive our altruistic desires as good for us, but, having %0astrength to use them, we submit a request, receive the necessary strength, ar %0aie Light for the Creator's sake, thereby ascending to a higher deg %0a%0a%0a%0a%0aThe return (Teshuva— repentance) means that by raising MAN (request for %0acorrection), we elevate some of the 320 corrupt parts from the impure forces, %0ainto which they fell, back to the world of Atzilut, where they existed prior to %0aAdam's sin. However, we are powerless to sort out and correct, i.e., to elevate the %0a%0a%0a%0aHeaven and Earth %0a%0a%0a%0a329 %0a%0a%0a%0athirty-two parts of Malchut herself, which exist in the eight Sefirot of this Partzuf %0a(world), for their level of corruption is beyond our ability to repair them. %0a%0aTherefore, out of the 320 (SHACH = Shin + Chet = 300 + 20) parts, we can, %0athat is, we are entitled to and must sort out and correct only 320 - 32 = 288 %0aparts (RAPACH = 288) by our return to the Creator, i.e., 9 x 32, where nine %0adesignates the first nine Sefirot in each Sefira that we are allowed to correct. %0aYet, we are unable to correct Malchut of each Sefira, for this requires a Light %0aof a special power. We will receive this Light from the Creator only after the %0acorrection of all the other 288 parts, that is, at the end of correction. %0a%0aThese thirty-two parts of Malchut, which are impossible and thus prohibited %0ato correct, are called Lev HaEven (Lamed-Bet Even— thirty-two stones). As I've %0arepeatedly mentioned, there is no such notion as "prohibition" in Kabbalah; %0athis word is used when it is necessary to point out the futility of trying despite %0aone's weakness and limitation. "Prohibited" means impossible, beyond one's %0apower. Moreover, it is not the Creator's prohibition; rather, as a result of one's %0apersonal faith and experience, one should admit that "prohibited" alludes to %0awhatever is still beyond one's power to correct. %0a%0aTherefore, GAR de AVI are concealed, and their Light does not shine. %0aAfter all, for all of its ten Sefirot to shine, a Zivug needs to be made on Malchut %0aherself, for Lev HaEven, the thirty-two uncorrected parts of Malchut herself are a %0asupplement to their ten Sefirot. And as long as these Kelim are missing, a complete %0aZivug is impossible. However, when the complete analysis and correction of the %0a288 (RAPACH = Reish + Peh + Chet = 200 + 80 + 8 = 288) Nitzotzin is completed, %0aLev HaEven will be corrected by itself, and no effort or corrections shall be %0arequired on our part. %0a%0aSo the prophet says: "A new heart also shall I give you, and a new spirit shall %0aI put within you; and I shall take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and %0aI shall give you a heart of flesh" (Yechezkel, 36:26). Then AVI will receive their %0aLight. However, this will occur at the end of correction, and before the end of %0acorrection, AHP of AVI will not be able to receive correction by means of our %0areturn, for we will be able to correct all of our egoistic desires, except for our very %0aessence, Malchut de Malchut. %0a%0aThese angels— Aza and Azael— are the real AHP de AVI that were destroyed %0aduring the breaking of the vessels, and were nearly restored before the sin of %0aAdam. However, Adam's sin destroyed them once more, this time until the very %0aend of correction. %0a%0a%0a%0a330 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aHence, both angels were complaining to the Creator about their Light, %0awhich has disappeared because of Adam, for they saw that there was no hope %0athat Adam would correct them through his return to the Creator. Moreover, %0athey saw that by his return, Adam had lowered their degree even more, for now %0athe entire correction and return was limited to only 288 parts, without any %0aparticipation or even mentioning of the thirty-two forbidden parts, Lev HaEven, %0awhich refer to the correction of AVI, whose Light is the Light of these angels, %0ajust as the Kelim of the true AHP de AVI are their Kelim. %0a%0aEach raising of MAN designates cutting off, separation of impurity— Lev %0aHaEven— from the food, RAPACH = 288 Nitzotzin, the parts that can be corrected. %0aIt follows that by preventing Aza and Azael from participating in the correction %0aof Lev HaEven, we lower them even more. This is why the two angels complained %0ato the Creator and tried to impede Adam from returning. After all, his return %0alowers them even further, for the thirty-two parts refer to them. %0a%0aTherefore, when the Creator saw that their complaints threatened to weaken %0aman's strength to return to Him, He told them that Adam's sin did not spoil %0aanything for them. For although there is greatness and holiness in them while %0athey are in Heaven and no impure forces can cling to them, still this perfection %0ais incomplete, as they cannot exist in our world, in a place of impure forces. %0a%0aThe Creator told them: "Hence, you have lost nothing as a result of Adam's %0asin, for you are no better than him anyway, as your degree is merely the result %0aof the place of your residence." And since the Creator's words constitute His %0aactions, they fell instantly from Heaven to earth (into egoism, of course, not to %0athe physical earth!). %0a%0aAnd since they came (spiritually descended) to the corporeal life (as %0aKabbalah defines it), they began to sort through and analyze the thirty-two parts %0aof complete egoism, called the "daughters of men," of which the Torah says: %0a"And the sons of great (angels) saw the daughters of men (egoistic Nukva), that %0athey were fair (they saw in her an opportunity for egoistic reception of pleasure), %0aand they took them as wives (used their egoistic desires), whomsoever they chose %0a(they themselves chose precisely this low state)" (Beresheet, 6:2). For they did not %0awant to separate the impurity of the thirty-two egoistic parts and prefer only %0a288, but took everything they wished, including Lev HaEven. %0a%0aHence, they also transgressed with Nukva Lilit (Lilith) the sinner, and wished %0ato draw the entire world toward sin, to fling it into the last stage of egoism, for %0athey did not wish man to return, as it completely contradicts their root. %0a%0a%0a%0aHeaven and Earth %0a%0a%0a%0a331 %0a%0a%0a%0aWhat did the Creator do? He put them in iron chains! For the Creator saw %0athat if they had the power to return to Heaven after the sin, all the people would %0afail in their attempts to aspire to the Creator in their desires, as the dominance %0aof these egoistic angels (forces) in man would be too great. (Rashi— the great %0aeleventh century Kabbalist and Biblical commentator— says that the entire Torah %0aspeaks in the words of man. Hence, everything is described in notions of time %0aand sequence of events. Similarly, the Creator seemingly creates and only then %0asees the results of his work). %0a%0aTherefore, although their root is quite high, the Creator gave the root of the %0aimpure forces His permission to act (here we see that the Creator governs all the %0aforces in creation). This root is called Barzel (iron), as it is written: "There was %0aneither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was in %0abuilding" (Melachim, 1, 6:7), for iron is an impure force. %0a%0aAnd since this impure force clang to the two angels and bound them, %0aas if with iron chains, by the desires that it dictates to them, such a state is %0acharacterized as being in the mountains of darkness, from which they can no %0alonger ascend until the end of correction. %0a%0aAnd when they approach the chain of Aza and Azael, rile and rouse them, %0ait designates the awakening of the fourth part of the will to receive, Malchut %0ade Malchut, the greatest desire to receive, called "wrath and rage." And they %0aleap over the mountains of darkness, thinking that the Creator wishes to bring %0ajustice upon them, for being bound by iron chains, they could not ascend to %0atheir roots and receive Hochma. %0a%0aTherefore, this action is considered leaping, an attempt to ascend, followed %0aby a fall, as a result of which they descend even deeper into the mountains of %0adarkness. And they think that because of their leaps (attempts to receive the %0aLight from their root), the Creator is becoming increasingly stricter with them; %0athus, they decide to stop leaping. %0a%0aHowever, even though they cannot give anything, as their attempts to reach up %0aare mere leaps and falls, it is nonetheless enough for the two rulers to receive Ohr %0aHochma from them, as this gives them the strength to swim in the sea of Hochma %0aof the impure force, whereas before they had only the strength to bathe in it. %0a%0aThe reason for this is that there is no action in this exalted impure force, %0aand everything is limited only in thoughts and desires, for such is the essence %0aof the impure forces (desires) that separate us from the Creator— before the level %0aof an action is achieved, purity disappears from it. Therefore, the impure forces %0awill never reach the level of an action. %0a%0a%0a%0a332 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aHence, the work for the impure forces is called Avoda Zara (alien work or %0aidol worshipping), as it is alien to spiritual work "for the Creator's sake," and %0ais performed according to the instruction and desires that the impure forces %0ainsert into man's thoughts. In this alien work for an alien master, the Creator %0apunishes even for mere thoughts and desires, as the prophet said: "That %0athe house of Israel may understand in their own heart" (Yechezkel, 14:5). %0aAnd the sages have said that man is accused and punished even for thoughts, %0adesires, and doubts in the alien work that transpires in his heart in exactly the same %0ameasure as for a completed action. Hence, the leaps of Aza and Azael are sufficient %0ain their desire to receive Hochma, although in reality they received nothing. %0a%0a157. And these two Creator-appointed rulers swim in the Great Sea, fly up %0afrom there, and at night go to Naamah, the mother of witches, for whom the %0afirst people fell (Beresheet, 6:1-4). And they wish to approach her, but she %0aleaps 60,000 Parsa'ot and assumes several different forms, so that people may %0abe deceived and enticed by her. %0a%0aAfter receiving power from Aza and Azael, they can now make a Zivug with %0aNaamah, as the first angels Aza and Azael erred. From that Zivug with Aza and %0aAzael, Naamah gave birth to all the spirits and witches of the world. The Torah %0acalls Aza and Azael the "sons of Gods" or the "sons of the great" (Beresheet, 6:2). %0a%0aYet, how could such exalted angels stoop to such depraved actions with %0aNaamah, and why did she give birth to spirits and witches, and not to people? %0a%0aThe thing is that the Upper World (AVI) was created by the letter Yod, by the %0amale part, which have nothing of the fourth part of Malchut, called Malchut de %0aMalchut. However, ZON (the lower world) was created by the letter Hey, which %0aincludes Malchut de Malchut. AVI aspire only to Ohr Hassadim, to altruistic %0aactions (bestowal), for Bina emerged as such in the four stages of Malchut s birth, %0aeven before the appearance of the first Kli (Malchut de Malchut). %0a%0aNevertheless, ZON need Ohr Hochma, since ZA was created as such in the %0afour stages of Malchut 's birth. Also, ZA wishes to receive Ohr Hochma within Ohr %0aHassadim, which he already has. %0a%0aThe Zivug of AVI, called the "Upper World," begets angels who desire Ohr %0aHassadim, just like AVI, from whom they were born. Human souls are born from %0athe Zivug of ZON, called the "lower world," and they, like ZON, from whom %0athey were born, desire only Ohr Hochma. %0a%0aThe moment the common soul of all the creatures (Adam) was born from %0aZON de Atzilut, ZON existed at the level of the Upper World (AVI) and clothed %0a%0a%0a%0aHeaven and Earth %0a%0a%0a%0a333 %0a%0a%0a%0ait. Like AVI, they, too, ended in the letter Yod of the name HaVaYaH. And %0athe letter Hey of the name HaVaYaH was concealed in their posterior side, %0aAchoraim or AHP. %0a%0aHence, Adam's level was quite high because ZON was in the Upper World %0aand ended in the letter Yod. The level of ZON was that of the angels that were %0aborn from AVI; therewith, ZON received Ohr Hochma according to their desires, %0aas ZON are meant to. %0a%0aAs a result, ZON contain the name Elokim, Supernal Hochma, the perfection %0aof the Upper World. This is because the ban of the first restriction to not receive %0aOhr Hochma does not apply to the letter Yod. Cain and Abel were born from this %0astate: Cain was born from ELEH and Abel from MI. Malchut herself (the last %0aletter Hey of the name HaVaYaH) was concealed in them both, and only the %0aletter Yod was revealed; hence, they contained Supernal Hochma. %0a%0aHowever, on the whole, Hochma is received in Kelim ELEH, ZAT de Bina, %0aby Cain's soul. This property of Cain is concealed in MI, as the last Hey is %0aconcealed inside Yod, and Cain wanted to make a Zivug with it, to receive Ohr %0aHochma in Malchut de Malchut, concealed in Abel's soul. %0a%0aIt is by this that he slew Abel, for after the last Hey was revealed, the ban %0aof the first restriction to receive Ohr Hochma in it was revealed. Hence, the %0aCreator's name Elokim disappeared from them both: MI, since it refers to GAR, %0aascended and disappeared (signifying Abel's slaying), and Cain's ELEH, since it %0arefers to ZAT, fell into the impure forces, called Arka. %0a%0aHowever, although it fell into the impure forces, sparks of Ohr Hochma still %0aremain in these Kelim (desires), as it is written that his daughters did not suffer %0afrom it greatly, and the sparks of Bina still remained in them. From this we can %0aunderstand that Naamah, one of Cain's daughters, was the most beautiful of all %0athe women in the world, for the sin transpired mainly in Cain's male part, and %0anot in his female part, as is described in the Talmud (Sanhedrin, 74:2). %0a%0aTherefore, after the Creator cast Aza and Azael into this world (created by %0athe letter Hey), and they've seen Naamah, a new hitherto non-existent desire %0aappeared within them— the desire to receive Ohr Hochma, for in their essence %0athey desire only Ohr Hassadim, and only the image of Naamah bore a new desire %0afor Ohr Hochma within them. %0a%0aAnd since there is no Hey (the last Hey, on which there is a ban to receive %0aOhr Hochma) in their essence and in that of Naamah (the last revealed one, for %0ait originates from Cain's ELEH), they erred in her, thinking that she is able to %0areceive Ohr Hochma, and made a Zivug with her. %0a%0a%0a%0a334 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aTheir error was twofold: %0a%0a1. Despite the fact that they do not have the last Hey from birth, since %0athe place determines, and they exist in this world, the last Hey already %0agoverns them, and they are forbidden to receive Ohr Hochma. %0a%0a2. They thought that the last Hey was absent in Naamah's structure, %0awhen in fact, it was concealed. Hence, spirits and witches were born %0afrom their Zivug. %0a%0aFrom this we can understand what is written in the Talmud (Hagiga, 16:1), %0athat witches are half-angels half-people, for with regard to their fathers, Aza and %0aAzael, they are angels, whereas with regard to Naamah, they are like people. But %0ashe could not give birth to people, for the seed within her came from angels, %0aand not from people. %0a%0aThe reason for the harm that they cause lies in the fact that they were born %0afrom depravity, the greatest possible distance from the Creator. Hence, their %0aimpurity accompanies them and brings harm wherever it possibly can. Therefore, %0aThe Zohar says that at night they come to Naamah, the mother of witches, for %0awhom the first people fell (see Beresheet, 6:1-4). %0a%0aIndeed, after they received strength from these angels, who were the first to %0aengage in depravity with Naamah, they could continue to engage in depravity %0awith her. The Zohar indicates that this is precisely why they come at night, for the %0apower of Hochma of the impure forces rules only in the darkness of night, the %0atime of judgment and restrictions, and also as the consequence of roots, namely %0aAza and Azael, who reside in the mountains of darkness. %0a%0aHowever, after engaging in depravity with them, she leapt 60,000 Parsa'ot, %0ai.e., she rose so high that she wanted to annul the Parsa below VAK de AA, whose %0aeach Sefira is defined as 10,000; hence, its VAK = 6 Sefirot equal 60,000. %0a%0aBut as soon as they think to approach her, she leaps 60,000 Parsa'ot, but %0aimmediately falls back down and is unable to touch them, for there is no action %0ain these upper impure forces, and all transgressions and all errors are only in %0athoughts and intentions. %0a%0aYet, there is still enough power in her to deceive and entice people, even %0aif man does not reach the level of impure actions and is only drawn to her in %0ahis thoughts and desires. However, the Creator punishes for such thoughts and %0adesires, as He does for actions, as the prophet warns us: "the house of Israel may %0aunderstand in their own heart" (Yechezkel, 14:5). And the impure force assumes %0a%0a%0a%0aHeaven and Earth %0a%0a%0a%0a335 %0a%0a%0a%0aseveral different shapes, such as depravity with married women, murder and %0aother things laid upon Lilit. %0a%0a158. These two rulers soar in the entire world and then return to their %0aplaces. And they rouse the sons of Cain's sons with a spirit of evil desires to %0abeget children. %0a%0a"Soar in the entire world"— they bring harm to man in all of their thoughts, %0awherever they can, and lure him into the darkness of night. For after man sins, %0athey return to their permanent place in Arka, where they rouse the sons of Cain %0ato defile the descendants with impurities. %0a%0aMoreover, The Zohar says that besides pushing the sons of Cain to sin in Arka, %0athey also soar in our world (Tevel), and compel the sons of this land to sin. %0a%0a159. The Heavens that rule there are not like ours, and the land bears neither %0aseed nor fruit by the power of Heaven, as ours does, and the grains grow again %0aonly once in several years. Hence, it is written of them that they could not correct %0aShemaya and Arka, and perished from the Supernal land, called Tevel, where %0athey will not be able to exist, nor rule over it, nor cause human beings to sin %0abecause of the night. Hence, they disappeared from Arka and from the place of %0aShemaya that were created by the name ELEH (as mentioned in item 14). %0a%0aOur Heavens receive the Light essential for the birth of subsequent Partzufim %0afrom ZA, which has Ohr Hochma. Hence, our land, which receives in Malchut de %0aZA, receives a grain and a seed. %0a%0aHowever, the Heavens in Arka do not have the Light to bear fruit and give %0abirth due to the rule of the impure forces that are there. Hence, unlike our land, %0aArka cannot produce; its land has no power to receive and grow a seed, and this %0aproperty appears in it only once in several years. %0a%0aHere The Zohar speaks of the two rulers: Afriron and Kastimon, who could %0anot correct Shemaya and Arka, to make them bear fruit. Therefore, these rulers %0aare not allowed to be here and seduce people in our land (Tevel), to sin, for %0awhen they are here, they bring harm to our land so as to make it like their %0aShemaya and Arka. %0a%0aTherefore, The Zohar says that they disappeared from the Supernal land of %0aTevel, from our land, for here they sought to bring harm by the power of the %0anight. They provoke people toward sin by virtue of the night, and it is a curse %0athat hangs over Arka because of their rule there. %0a%0aOur Heavens were created by the name ELEH, for our Heavens receive %0afrom ZA, which was corrected by ELEH's properties, by the words: IN THE %0a%0a%0a%0a336 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aBEGINNING THE CREATOR CREATED, where MI is connected to ELEH. %0aHence, our land is corrected by the Supernal holiness and purity. Therefore, %0athese two rulers are not allowed to rule here. %0a%0a160. Hence, there exists a Targum, a translation (from Hebrew to Aramaic, %0awhich The Zohar dubs Targum), so the holy angels will not think that it %0ais said about them, so they will not harm us. This is the secret of the word %0aELEH— as we have already stated, it is a holy word that cannot be translated %0ainto a Targum. %0a%0aEverything but the word ELEH has been translated into the language of %0athe Targum, as it is said in item 149, that ELEH disappeared from both Arka %0aand Shemaya, for the word ELEH is untranslatable, as it constitutes the full %0aconnection between ELEH and MI, which causes the descent of Ohr Hochma. %0aAnd should anyone sin and corrupt the letters ELEH, as Cain had done, they %0awould fall to the impure forces, so even the holiness of the Targum (VAK of the %0apure forces) would depart from them.

This verse should be examined carefully, for %0a%3c whoever claims that there is another Creator disappears from the world, as it is %0a%3c written, "He who claims that there is another Creator perishes from both the %0a%3c earth and from Heavens, for there is no other Creator, but the Almighty." %0a%3c %0a%3c Here The Zohar continues to discuss the correction of the bride. It starts %0a%3c with the first sentence of the Torah: IN THE BEGINNING THE CREATOR %0a%3c CREATED, with the root and the source of all the corrections of the bride %0a%3c (Malchut) during the 6,000 years. %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut's entire correction occurs only through her union with Bina and %0a%3c the reception of Bina's properties. In the verse, IN THE BEGINNING THE %0a%3c CREATOR CREATED, the Creator is called Elokim, signifying Bina. This means %0a%3c that He created the world by the property of Bina for the purpose of correction. %0a%3c %0a%3c Elokim consists of MI-Bina and ELEH-Malchut. Thanks to the constant %0a%3c union of MI and ELEH, the world can exist. The Creator is Bina, called Elokim, %0a%3c and as a result of Ohr Hochma clothing in Ohr Hassadim, the union of MI and %0a%3c ELEH provides ELEH with the property of Bina. It is through this correction %0a%3c that the world is able to exist. %0a%3c %0a%3c The union of MI and ELEH does not permit for the existence of other, %0a%3c foreign, egoistic forces within the Partzuf. These are the so-called "other gods," %0a%3c who cannot sustain the world, as they separate MI from ELEH and do not clothe %0a%3c the Light of pleasure (Hochma) in the altruistic intention of Hassadim (for the %0a%3c Creator's sake), which leads to Ohr Hochma departing the Partzuf, leaving ELEH. %0a%3c Therefore, it is forbidden to believe that man is governed by any other forces %0a%3c besides the Creator, for instead of existence and reception of the Light of Life, %0a%3c such belief brings the world and man only ruin and disappearance of this Light. %0a%3c %0a%3c 315 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 316 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 152. With the exception of ELEH, everything is written in Aramaic. This is %0a%3c called "translation." He asks: However, should you suggest that it is because %0a%3c the holy angels do not understand the translation, i.e., the Aramaic language, %0a%3c then everything should have been said in Hebrew, so the holy angels would %0a%3c hear and be grateful for it. He replies: This is exactly why it is written in the %0a%3c translation (in Aramaic), as the holy angels neither hear nor understand it, %0a%3c and hence will not envy people, which would be detrimental to the latter. For %0a%3c in this case, even the holy angels are called Creators, and they are included in %0a%3c the group of Creators, but they have not created Heaven and earth. %0a%3c %0a%3c Aramaic is referred to as "translation." It is very close to the holy language of %0a%3c Hebrew, but angels neither need nor know it nonetheless. Yet, they know and need %0a%3c all the other languages of the nations of the world. This is so because the transla- %0a%3c tion from the holy language is called its "reverse side," its VAK without GAR. %0a%3c %0a%3c In other words, there is an altruistic language, which is hence called "holy," %0a%3c and its reverse, preliminary stage, hence called "translation," is the Aramaic %0a%3c language. No other language in the world but Aramaic can act as translation %0a%3c from the holy language. All the other languages in the nations of the world %0a%3c (egoistic desires) are strictly egoistic and are unrelated to altruism. They are not %0a%3c AHP with regard to GE (the holy language). %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, the translation is truly close to the holy language. However, %0a%3c there is one distinction here, which renders it unnecessary to angels: the holy %0a%3c language is like the scale pointer that shows the extent of balance between %0a%3c the right and left scales, where the pointer moves between the two scales and %0a%3c delivers its judgment— toward the scale of reward (for merits) or towards the scale %0a%3c of punishment (for sins). It brings everything back to the state of correction, to %0a%3c purity and holiness, and is hence called the holy language ("Introduction to The %0a%3c Study of Ten Sefirot," item 120). %0a%3c %0a%3c As it is written in item sixteen, Heaven, earth, and all that inhabit them %0a%3c were created by MA, i.e., Malchut, as it is written, "MA = WHAT = HOW %0a%3c glorious is Your name in all the earth, which You have set above the Heavens!" %0a%3c Indeed, Heaven was created by the name (property) of MA (Malchut), whereas %0a%3c the Heaven that is mentioned alludes to Bina, called ML But all is explained by %0a%3c the name Elokim. %0a%3c %0a%3c The name Elokim is revealed in Heaven and earth, which were created by the %0a%3c power of MA, by attaching the letters ELEH from Ima-Bina with the help of MAN %0a%3c and good deeds of the lower ones. Therefore, the Light of GAR, i.e., Ohr Hochma, %0a%3c called Elokim, is consistent neither in Heaven (Bina) nor on earth (ZON). %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Heaven and Earth %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 317 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Typically, only GE are present above the Parsa, in ZON of the world of %0a%3c Atzilut, whereas their AHP is below the Parsa, in the worlds BYA, for ZON %0a%3c themselves are unwilling to receive Ohr Hochma unless it is to be passed on to %0a%3c the Partzufim— the souls of the righteous— in the worlds of BYA. %0a%3c %0a%3c When the lower ones, the righteous that exist spiritually in the worlds of BYA, %0a%3c raise MAN from below upwards, from their place in BYA to Malchut de Atzilut, %0a%3c MA turns into MI and the letters ELEH join with MI. Together, they create the %0a%3c word Elokim, which is the Light of Heaven and earth. However, if the lower ones %0a%3c corrupt their deeds by sinking into egoistic intentions, the Light disappears and %0a%3c leaves Sefirot K-H with the Light Ruach-Nefesh (called MI or MA), while the letters %0a%3c ELEH fall into the impure forces, for MI is GE and ELEH is AHP. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, the entire correction depends exclusively on attaching the letters %0a%3c ELEH to MI with the help of MAN. Hence, this correction is called the "holy %0a%3c language," like the scale pointer, which determines the balance between egoistic %0a%3c desires and altruistic intentions, i.e., the reception for the Creator's sake. This is %0a%3c why the scale pointer is set in the middle, and by means of such interaction of %0a%3c the properties of Malchut (the will to receive) and Bina (the will to bestow), one %0a%3c can achieve the reception of Ohr Hochma for the Creator's sake. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Light is called "holy," as it passes the holy name Elokim to ZON, descends %0a%3c from Bina to ZON, and transfers the letters ELEH to the pure and holy side, to %0a%3c the scale of merit. This is why the Hebrew word for "scales" is Mawznaim (from %0a%3c the word Awzen), for the Light in AHP {Awzen-Hotem-Peh) is named according to %0a%3c its highest Light, the Light of Awzen of the Sefira Bina or Ohr Neshama. %0a%3c %0a%3c Keter - Galgalta - Forehead/Skull - Yechida %0a%3c Hochma - Eynaim - eyes - Haya %0a%3c %0a%3c Parsa %0a%3c %0a%3c Bina - Awzen - ear - Neshama %0a%3c %0a%3c ZA - Hotem - nose - Ruach \ AHP %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut - Peh - mouth - Nefesh ) %0a%3c %0a%3c And the language of translation called Targum is opposite to the holy %0a%3c language of Mawznaim (scales). It is so because when the lower ones do not raise %0a%3c MAN and do not harbor pure intentions, it is defined as an aspiration to use %0a%3c only the desires to receive, designated by the letters ELEH, and which do not %0a%3c aspire to unite with the desire (property) of bestowal (the letters MI-Bina). As a %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 318 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c result, AHP of ZON, called MA, descend and Heaven and earth (ZON) return %0a%3c to the state of VAK. %0a%3c %0a%3c Such a state is called the language of Targum. The Gematria of the word %0a%3c Tardema (sleep) matches that of the word Targum. In Hebrew, the word Targum is %0a%3c spelled with the same letters as the words Tered MA, which means "descending %0a%3c MA," for through this spiritually impure language, AHP = MA (designated %0a%3c by the words Tered MA) becomes revealed. This leads to the descent from the %0a%3c scale of merit to the scale of punishment. While this is happening, the state %0a%3c of GE is called "sleep." %0a%3c %0a%3c However, all this refers only to ZON, to Heaven and earth created in MA, %0a%3c the desires of reception. This is because they have emerged as a result of a Zivug %0a%3c on Yesod, called MA. But the holy angels that emerged from the Zivug de Neshikin %0a%3c (kissing Zivug) of AVI, and which have only MI but no MA (only altruistic desires %0a%3c of bestowal, the property of IMA-Bina), permanently exist in the state of VAK %0a%3c without GAR, that is, without Ohr Hochma. %0a%3c %0a%3c On the other hand, their VAK is Ohr Hassadim of MI = Ima-Bina. Ohr %0a%3c Hassadim in Bina is as important as GAR, for it fills desires with just as perfect %0a%3c a sensation as does the GAR, to the point that they reject Ohr Hochma, just like %0a%3c Ima. And there is holiness in them; hence, GAR are called holy, as well. %0a%3c %0a%3c There are two reasons why angels do not respond to the language of Targum, %0a%3c which adds MA to ZON and returns ZON to the state of VAK: %0a%3c %0a%3c 1. Even when ZON are in the state of GAR due to the influence of the %0a%3c holy language, angels do not receive GAR (Hochma) from it, as, just %0a%3c like Ima, they want only Ohr Hassadim. %0a%3c %0a%3c 2. The addition of the Achoraim (AHP) does not apply to angels whatsoever; %0a%3c %0a%3c they lack the properties of MA. Hence, The Zohar says that THE HOLY %0a%3c ANGELS HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO NEED for translation AND %0a%3c DO NOT LISTEN to it. They do not need it because they neither %0a%3c lose anything when it is present nor gain anything when it is absent, %0a%3c as they constitute the property of VAK and lack the property of MA. %0a%3c %0a%3c AND THEY SHALL NOT ENVY MAN-this sentence refers primarily to %0a%3c the damnation of other gods, the forces that prevent man from revealing GAR, %0a%3c Ohr Hochma. As a result, he loses the Light and the letters ELEH, for angels do %0a%3c not have the properties of GAR de Hochma either, but only GAR de Hassadim. %0a%3c Thus, they feel ashamed of their descent to such a low degree, and envy us for %0a%3c considering ourselves significant. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Heaven and Earth %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 319 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar says that in this case, even the holy angels are called "Creators," %0a%3c but they have not created Heaven and earth and are called "Creators-Elokim" %0a%3c (forces) because they come from Ima-Bina (called Elokim), thus existing in the %0a%3c general Elokim. But THEY HAVE NOT CREATED HEAVEN AND EARTH, %0a%3c for they cannot uphold the existence of Heaven and earth in GAR de Hochma. %0a%3c However, Heaven and earth (the correction of the world to its ultimate merging %0a%3c with the Creator) cannot exist unless man settles there (man must consist of %0a%3c egoistic and altruistic desires) and sows and reaps (corrects his egoistic desires by %0a%3c uniting with the properties of Bind). This existence is possible only in the Light %0a%3c of GAR de Hochma (the reception of Ohr Hochma for the Creator's sake). Hence, %0a%3c angels do not create Heaven and earth. %0a%3c %0a%3c 153. He asks: earth is called Arka, when it should read, Ar'a. He answers: %0a%3c because Arka is one of the seven lands below, where the sons of Cain's sons %0a%3c reside. Indeed, after being banished from the face of the earth, they descended %0a%3c there and fathered generations; wisdom became so lost that all understanding %0a%3c was lost, and this is a double land, consisting of darkness and Light. %0a%3c %0a%3c Each of the seven Sefirot (the six Sefirot of ZA and Malchut) contain the %0a%3c properties of the other six. Thus, each one of them contains the seven Sefirot %0a%3c HGT NHYM. In other words, Malchut, too, has seven Sefirot, and the lower %0a%3c world contains seven lands, as well, called Eretz, Adama, Arka, Gia, Neshia, %0a%3c Tzia and level. %0a%3c %0a%3c Our land is called Tevel and is the highest of the seven lands. Arka is the %0a%3c third of the seven lands. The souls of Cain and Abel descend from the word %0a%3c Elokim, but due to the impurity that Chava (Eve), Adam's wife, received from %0a%3c the serpent, the soul of Cain emerged first from the letters ELEH, followed %0a%3c by the soul of Abel, which emerged from the letters ML These two Partzufim %0a%3c were meant to unite and incorporate their properties in one another, which %0a%3c would make the name Elokim shine in both of them, as when MI is permanently %0a%3c present in ELEH. However, the impure force that emerged together with Cain's %0a%3c soul incited him against his brother (MI of the word Elokim) to the point that he %0a%3c rose against Abel (MI in Elokim) and slew him. This is because the disappearance %0a%3c of the property of MI-Bina from ELEH is tantamount to murder. %0a%3c %0a%3c Without the support of the properties of MI, ELEH (Cain's own property) %0a%3c fell into the impure forces: from the spiritual level of the holy land to the impure %0a%3c place (of egoistic desires). And he lost his descendants (Partzufim filled with Light) %0a%3c because of the rule of the impure forces (the disappearance of the screen). %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 320 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Thus, the holy language within him was substituted for translation, for he %0a%3c had lost the wisdom (Ohr Hochma). After all, the impure forces lack wisdom, as %0a%3c they have only the Light of HB without Daat. %0a%3c %0a%3c The slaying of Abel, i.e., the exit of Light from this Partzuf (item 152), occurs %0a%3c because MI is formed in ZON exclusively by the power of MAN (raised by the pure %0a%3c thoughts of the righteous in the worlds of BYA). Then appear the letters ELEH, %0a%3c and the word Elokim becomes as complete in ZON as it is in AVI. Malchut ends just %0a%3c like ZA, like Ima, due to the replacing of the letter Hey with Yod (item 17). %0a%3c %0a%3c However, the letter He;y does not disappear from MA forever. Rather, it %0a%3c simply enters the inner part of Malchut and hides there (the will to receive %0a%3c receives its fulfillment from altruistic actions, from Ohr Hassadim. Hence, its %0a%3c egoistic aspirations are temporarily unfelt, as they are concealed in Ohr Hassadim). %0a%3c Meanwhile, the letter Yod is revealed in ML %0a%3c %0a%3c This is why the Creator's holy name Elokim is also found in ZON, in Heaven %0a%3c and earth. However, Cain raised MAN not in holiness and purity, but wished %0a%3c to use the letters ELEH— which relate to him— for his own pleasure. This is %0a%3c described as, AND CAIN ROSE UP AGAINST ABEL, HIS BROTHER, for he %0a%3c put himself above his brother, to rule over MI (Abel). %0a%3c %0a%3c However, AHP of Nukva (the hitherto concealed letter Hey of MA) were %0a%3c immediately revealed, and the word MI disappeared from Malchut. Hence, %0a%3c Abel's soul, which stems from MI of NuLua (MI fill the Partzuf with Light and are %0a%3c considered its soul) ascends and disappears as well, as is described by the words, %0a%3c AND SLEW HIM, for the Light's exit from the Partzuf is referred to as death. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is why The Zohar describes this process in the following way: The %0a%3c serpent's impure force was within Cain (Beresheet, 2:4); hence, he wished to %0a%3c strengthen the letters ELEH, annul MI, and govern them. That is why he revealed %0a%3c AHP of Nukva (MA) and MI disappeared from Nukva, whereupon Abel's soul, %0a%3c which descends from MI, disappeared as well (AND SLEW HIM). %0a%3c %0a%3c Thus, Cain himself (ELEH) fell under the rule of the impure forces, called %0a%3c Arka or Eretz Nod, as it is written in the Torah: "And he settled in the land of %0a%3c Nod" (Beresheet, 4:16). %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar calls it a double land, one that contains both Light and darkness. %0a%3c This is because Light and darkness mix and act (rule) together, as there are two %0a%3c rulers in that land, who divide the power equally between them. One rules over %0a%3c darkness, the other over Light. Hence, in this state one is unable to separate %0a%3c Light from darkness, and only help from Above, the descending Light of reason, %0a%3c enables one to tell between the true Ruler and the lord of darkness. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Heaven and Earth %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 321 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 154. And there are two rulers there— one rules over darkness and one over %0a%3c Light, and they become hostile to each other. When Cain descended there, %0a%3c they joined together and became complete. And they all saw that they were %0a%3c Cain's descendants. Therefore, their two heads are like two serpents, except %0a%3c for when the ruler of Light defeats the other, the ruler of darkness. Hence, %0a%3c they enter Light and darkness, and become as one. %0a%3c %0a%3c We need to review item 14, which expounds on the creation of the holy %0a%3c name Elokim. First, the letters ELEH ascend and join MI to form a simple %0a%3c word, since Ohr Hassadim is still insufficient, whereas holiness (Ohr Hochma) %0a%3c cannot enter the Kli (desire) without being clothed in Ohr Hassadim. Hence, it %0a%3c is concealed in the name Elokim. %0a%3c %0a%3c That is why a Zivug takes place in MI— to receive Ohr Hassadim, which clothes %0a%3c Ohr Hochma, thereby correcting the name Elokim: Ml BARAH ELEH— BARAH %0a%3c is the source of Ohr Hassadim, which clothes Ohr Hochma, thus connecting MI %0a%3c to ELEH, which brings correction to the name Elokim. MI-Bina consists of GAR %0a%3c (AVI with the property of pure altruism), who never receive Ohr Hochma, and %0a%3c ZAT (YESHSUT), who do receive Ohr Hochma. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, as the letters ELEH begin to ascend to MI, they first rise to ZAT %0a%3c de Ml (YESHSUT), who receive Ohr Hochma, but are currently concealed in the %0a%3c name Elokim. Then transpires the second Zivug on GAR de Ml, AVI, altruistic %0a%3c desires, which provide ELEH with Ohr Hassadim, thus bringing correction to %0a%3c the name Elokim. %0a%3c %0a%3c AVI - GARdeBina - Ohr Hassadim %0a%3c %0a%3c YESHSUT - ZATdeBina - Ohr Hochma %0a%3c ZON %0a%3c %0a%3c Since ELEH lacks Ohr Hassadim, those deprived from Ohr Hochma are called %0a%3c Partzuf Cain. Not only did Cain fail to raise MAN to receive MI with Hassadim, %0a%3c he also wished to receive Ohr Hochma from AVI, thereby destroying the Partzuf %0a%3c named Abel, for the egoistic desires of AHP de Malchut of Atzilut were exposed. %0a%3c The Light disappeared from Partzuf Abel, signifying its death, whereas Cain %0a%3c himself fell into the impure forces— ELEH. %0a%3c %0a%3c The place of these impure forces is called Arka. Also, two rulers exist there, %0a%3c emerging from the impure ELEH: when AHP de MA in Malchut is concealed, %0a%3c while AHP de Ml are revealed, they can pass the Light from the perfect, %0a%3c pure, and holy name Elokim to the souls. Ohr Hochma of ELEH (received by %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 322 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c YESHSUT) then clothes in Hassadim (received from AVI), and the holy name %0a%3c Elokim becomes revealed. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, since the impure forces cling only to the AHP of the pure forces %0a%3c (to MA), the letters ELEH within them exist in two incomplete states: (i) when %0a%3c no Hassadim are present at all; (ii) when Ohr Hochma in ELEH cannot clothe in %0a%3c Hassadim due to the lack of Hassadim de Ml; hence, ELEH are kept in darkness. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is the male part of the impure ELEH, as these Kelim are intended for %0a%3c Ohr Hochma. However, they have no Hochma due to the lack of Hassadim de ML %0a%3c Hence, they are kept in darkness, devoid of both Hochma and Hassadim. Yet, %0a%3c these are great Kelim, for if they had been able to receive Ohr Hassadim, they %0a%3c would have been able to receive Ohr Hochma within it, too. %0a%3c %0a%3c The female part of the impure ELEH stems from AHP de MA of the holy %0a%3c Nukva, the Kli for Ohr Hassadim. However, the impure Nukva is considerably %0a%3c injured, as she is the basis for everyone's remoteness from the Creator, as she %0a%3c impersonates the holy Malchut. Depending on the extent of her corruption, %0a%3c she has a multitude of impure names. Yet, she still retains a tiny Light (Ner %0a%3c Dakik), since her Kelim stem from AHP de MA, the roots of which are Kelim %0a%3c of Ohr Hassadim. %0a%3c %0a%3c These male and female parts of the impure ELEH are ZA and Malchut of %0a%3c the impure forces, the two rulers in Arka. The male part rules over darkness %0a%3c and the female part rules over the Light that is there. They complain against %0a%3c each another, since they are opposite. The male part complains because it is the %0a%3c Kelim of the letters ELEH, which are empty of Ohr Hochma; it hates the forces %0a%3c of remoteness from the Creator and forgery, existing within the Kelim of the %0a%3c female part of the impure forces, and prefers to remain in its darkness. %0a%3c %0a%3c Nukva of the impure forces, however, who has a small Light of Hassadim, %0a%3c does not aspire for Ohr Hochma, let alone for the darkness in which her male %0a%3c part abides. Therefore, she complains about the male part and distances from %0a%3c it. As The Zohar says, two rulers govern there: one (the male part) over darkness, %0a%3c and the other (the female part) over Light, and they are hostile towards each %0a%3c other, for the male part rules over darkness and the female rules over Light. %0a%3c Hence, they hate, slander, and complain against each other. And since they are %0a%3c thereby distanced from one another, they cannot expand their dominance and %0a%3c are incapable of causing any harm. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, after Cain had sinned and dropped the pure letters of ELEH of %0a%3c his soul into the impure forces of Arka, his ELEH, which are concealed from %0a%3c Hassadim, clothed in the tiny Light present in the impure forces. This revives %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Heaven and Earth %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 323 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c the small Kelim de Hochma in Cain's ELEH, for the Light of the impure forces %0a%3c bestows life upon them, just like the pure Light of Hassadim. %0a%3c %0a%3c As a result, the male part of ELEH of the impure forces, too, made a Zivug %0a%3c with this Nukva, who clothed Cain's ELEH, since he has these Kelim, as well. %0a%3c With the help of this Zivug, Cain fathered his descendants, the sparks of Ohr %0a%3c Hochma that remain in the letters ELEH, which are not mixed with the male %0a%3c impure Kelim of ELEH that clothed in the Light of Nukva of the impure forces. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is why The Zohar says that when Cain descended there, everything %0a%3c merged and became complete, for the sparks of Ohr Hochma that remained %0a%3c in Cain's ELEH were clothed in the Light of Nukva of the impure forces. %0a%3c Consequently, her male impure force wished to enjoy the sparks of Ohr Hochma %0a%3c that are in Cain's ELEH. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, they made a Zivug, i.e., spread and completed one another, and %0a%3c everyone saw that they were the descendants of Cain, that this Zivug produced %0a%3c the descendants, the clothing of the sparks of Ohr Hochma in Cain's impure %0a%3c ELEH. Thus, the sparks of Ohr Hochma of Cain's soul were revealed, and %0a%3c everyone saw that they were Cain's descendants, born of a vile Zivug. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, their two heads are like two serpents, for they were born from %0a%3c a union of the male and female parts of the impure ELEH, which are initially %0a%3c opposite to one another. Therefore, Cain's descendants have two heads, from %0a%3c the two impure forces: one craves the darkness of the desires to receive Ohr %0a%3c Hochma, and the other craves the Light within the impure desires of the impure %0a%3c Nukva. And the two serpent heads correspond to the two animals that belong to %0a%3c the system of the pure forces: the bull and the eagle. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, the two heads exist only when the male part is dominant, when %0a%3c darkness rules. Indeed, by clothing in the Light of ~Nukva in order to enjoy the %0a%3c small sparks of Ohr Hochma, the male part also supports (against its will) the %0a%3c dominance of its Nukva, for it wants her Light. As a result, their descendants %0a%3c have two heads: the first pulls in one direction and the second in another. %0a%3c %0a%3c Nukva of the impure forces does not need their male part whatsoever, as %0a%3c her male part exists in darkness and cannot give her anything. Therefore, Nukva %0a%3c dominates and prevails in her impurity, leaving nothing of the properties of the %0a%3c male part. Consequently, Cain's two-headed descendants become one-headed. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar tells us that the ruler of Light defeats the lord of darkness. When %0a%3c the impure Nukva, which has the Light, dominates, she defeats the male impure %0a%3c part, as well as the other male ruler. She defeats the male part, fully subduing it %0a%3c to her rule, and they include themselves in her Light and darkness, and become %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 324 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c as one. Consequently, the rule of the male part (darkness) is included under the %0a%3c rule of the female part (Light), and the two heads become one. %0a%3c %0a%3c 155. For these are the two rulers, called Afrira and Kastimon, who resemble %0a%3c holy angels with six wings. One has the image of a bull, and the other of an %0a%3c eagle. And when they unite, they create an image of man. %0a%3c %0a%3c The male impure force is called Kastimon (from the word Kosti, devastation), %0a%3c for it is darkness and is unfit for man's life. And the impure Nukva, the female %0a%3c part, is called Afrira (from the word Afar, dust), and is unfit for sowing. She is %0a%3c called so in order to show that although she contains Light, she is insufficient %0a%3c for sowing the seed and producing harvest to feed human beings. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar also says that she resembles holy angels with six wings, for the six %0a%3c wings of the holy angels correspond to the letter Vav in the name HaVaYaH. In %0a%3c contrast, there are only four wings in the impure forces, corresponding to the %0a%3c name ADM, indicating the height of the impure forces with regard to the holy %0a%3c angels, opposite them. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Upper Light is called "wine," bringing joy to the Creator and to human %0a%3c beings. However, wine residue contains Sigim or wine yeast. And from this waste %0a%3c emerges the foremost wrecker of the world, for he is still connected to purity %0a%3c (to yeast) and has the image of a man. However, as he descends to bring people %0a%3c harm, he assumes the image of a bull. This is why a bull is the first of the four %0a%3c main types of wrecker. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, The Zohar tells us that Kastimon is a wrecker in the image of a bull, %0a%3c thus indicating that it is the basis of all wreckers that are called "the impure bull." %0a%3c It is the Sigim of the Supernal Ohr Hochma of the holy name Elokim, the impure %0a%3c ELEH that correspond to the pure ELEH of the name Elokim. For Sigim and %0a%3c yeast stand below it, but since it is still connected to purity, it has the image of %0a%3c man, for Ohr Hochma of the name Elokim is T^elem (image and likeness) of man, %0a%3c of which it is said: "Be T^elem Elokim— created man in image and likeness." %0a%3c %0a%3c Yet, when separated from purity (altruism) through deterioration of its %0a%3c desires and, consequently, of its properties, it descends to its place (befitting %0a%3c these properties) in Arka, and assumes the image (properties) of a bull. And its %0a%3c Nukva assumes (in Arka) the form (properties) of an eagle, in congruence with %0a%3c her goal and action of Linshor (to fall out)— to bring about the fall of human %0a%3c souls under her power. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, the word Nesher (vulture) is derived from the word Neshira (fall), just %0a%3c as leaves fall from a tree, for the role of the impure Nukva is to seek people out %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Heaven and Earth %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 325 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c and bring them to a state of night and darkness, to the destruction of the holy %0a%3c covenant, as a result of which people's souls depart from them (item 131). %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, The Zohar tells us: "And when they unite, they form the image of %0a%3c man," i.e., if they return and unite with purity, existing as wine yeast, they return %0a%3c and assume once more the image of man, just as before they descended to Arka %0a%3c and became wreckers. %0a%3c %0a%3c 156. When they are covered with darkness, they turn into a serpent with two %0a%3c heads, and move like a serpent. They soar in the void and bathe in the Great %0a%3c Sea, and when they approach the chains of Aza and Azael, they rile and rouse %0a%3c them and leap into the mountains of darkness, thinking that the Creator %0a%3c wishes to bring justice upon them. %0a%3c %0a%3c I suggest that the reader will try to comment on The Zohar on his own, %0a%3c without any help, and then compare his thoughts with those stated below. This %0a%3c way, we might understand what Rabbi Yehuda Ashlag has done for us with his %0a%3c commentary. Prior to the appearance of his commentaries on the books of the %0a%3c ARI and The Zohar, there was no way for us to understand Kabbalah correctly, %0a%3c only a handful of people in each generation could climb the spiritua %0a%3c ler on their own. %0a%3c %0a%3c Now, however, I assure the reader that simply by constantly reading eve %0a%3c ks, which retell the compositions of the great Kabbalists, Rabbi Ashlag %0a%3c his elder son and my teacher, Rabbi Baruch Ashlag, anyone can attain ascension %0a%3c to the Creator. I think that those who have already read previous books realize %0a%3c that this is truly possible! %0a%3c %0a%3c As The Zohar already mentioned in item 154, when the impure Nukva %0a%3c dominates man through her Light, the two heads become as one. However, in %0a%3c the darkness, when the male part, called Kastimon, dominates, they turn into %0a%3c a serpent with two heads, for the male part is unable to annul the power of the %0a%3c female part, as it needs to be clothed in her Light. Hence, the serpent has two %0a%3c heads. And they move like a serpent— aiming to bring harm (the property of the %0a%3c serpent), to tempt Chava to dine on the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge. %0a%3c %0a%3c By the power of the Rosh of the impure Nukva they soar in the void, which %0a%3c contains the root of the impure force, called "void" or the greatest fall, as it %0a%3c is written: "They ascended up to Heaven, they descended down to the abyss" %0a%3c (Tehilim, 107:26). By the power of the impure male part, they bathe in the Great %0a%3c Sea, in Ohr Hochma of the impure forces. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 326 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, Arka is called the Land of Nod, as it constantly sways from the %0a%3c rule of the two heads: those that reside there keep alternating between ascending %0a%3c up to the Great Sea and descending down into the void. %0a%3c %0a%3c The angels Aza and Azael are very exalted angels. Indeed, even after they %0a%3c had fallen from Heaven into our world, into the mountains of darkness, linked %0a%3c by a metal chain, so great was their power that with their help Bil'am (Balaam) %0a%3c attained the degree of prophecy, of which it is written: "Sees the Creator's %0a%3c presence" (Bamidbar, 24:4). %0a%3c %0a%3c This is described as "falls and opens his eyes," for Aza is referred to as %0a%3c "falling" because of his fall from Heaven to earth. And Azael is called "he who %0a%3c opens his eyes" with regard to Aza, at whose face the Creator throws darkness. %0a%3c And with regard to Bil'am's prophetic degree, our sages have said the following: %0a%3c "There has not been a prophet in Israel like Moshe, not in Israel, but there was %0a%3c one among the nations of the world, and his name was Bil'am" (Bamidbar-Raba, %0a%3c 14)— so great was his prophetic degree. %0a%3c %0a%3c And the reason for their downfall from Heaven to earth lies in their %0a%3c complaints against man at the moment of his making. Yet, there were many %0a%3c angels complaining and objecting, so why did the Creator cast down only these %0a%3c two? The answer to this question can be found in items 416-425 of the chapter %0a%3c "Balak" in The Zohar. Briefly, it says that when the desire to create Adam (or %0a%3c man, since the Hebrew word for man is Adam) appeared in the Creator, He %0a%3c summoned the Supernal angels, seated them before Him, and told them of His %0a%3c desire to create man. %0a%3c %0a%3c The angels replied: "What is man, that You are mindful of him?" (Tehilim, %0a%3c 8:5), meaning what are the properties of this man that You so wish to create? He %0a%3c replied to them: "This man will be similar to Me and his wisdom will surpass %0a%3c yours, for the human soul includes all the angels and Supernal Degrees, just as %0a%3c his body includes all the creatures of this world." %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, at the moment of creation of man's soul, the Creator summoned %0a%3c all the Supernal angels, so they would pass all of their properties and forces %0a%3c to man's soul. It is therefore written: "Let us make man in our image, in our %0a%3c likeness," meaning that man's "image and likeness" includes all of the properties %0a%3c of all the angels. %0a%3c %0a%3c The words "image and likeness" are written in quotation marks, since the %0a%3c words Tzelem and Demut (image and likeness) are not mere words that simply %0a%3c describe likeness. Rather, they constitute very meaningful spiritual notions. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Heaven and Earth %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 327 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c But the angels' question should be interpreted as follows: "What kind of a %0a%3c creature is this man and what is his nature? How shall we benefit from passing %0a%3c (including) our properties in him?" The Creator replied to this: "This man %0a%3c will be similar to Me and his wisdom will surpass yours." In other words, the %0a%3c Creator thus promised them that man will embrace all of their qualities (the %0a%3c properties of Tzelem), and that he will be wiser than them. However, because of %0a%3c their connection to him, they will also benefit from his great attainments and %0a%3c acquire everything that they presently lack. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is because the human soul includes all the spiritual degrees and all the %0a%3c utmost properties of all the angels. And just as his body includes all the materials %0a%3c and creatures of our world with all of their properties, so was the Creator's wish %0a%3c that his soul would absorb the whole of creation within it. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is written in the Torah: "Yaakov and Israel shall be told of the Creator's %0a%3c works (Bamidbar, 23:23)." The sages have said that in the future the angels will %0a%3c ask Israel for things that they do not know themselves, for Israel's attainments %0a%3c will be beyond that of the angels. Hence, all the angels took part in the creation %0a%3c of man and integrated all their properties within him. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, once man was created and sinned, thus becoming guilty before the %0a%3c Creator, the angels Aza and Azael appeared before the Creator with accusations %0a%3c "that man, whom You have created, has sinned before You." For these words, %0a%3c the Creator cast them down from their exalted and holy degree, and thus, they %0a%3c began to deceive human beings. %0a%3c %0a%3c Of all the angels, only these two, Aza and Azael, came before the Creator %0a%3c to complain about Adam's sins, for only they knew that man shall return to %0a%3c the Creator. However, Aza and Azael also knew that the harm brought to them %0a%3c by man's sin will not be corrected by this return. Moreover, they would prefer %0a%3c man to not return in his desires to the Creator at all. This is why they were the %0a%3c only ones that complained about Adam's sin, because from their perspective, %0a%3c this sin is incorrigible. %0a%3c %0a%3c The thing is that the breaking of the vessels and Adam's sin constitute the %0a%3c same breaking, disappearance of the screen (anti-egoistic willpower or intention %0a%3c to act for the Creator's sake). The difference is that the breaking of the vessels %0a%3c signifies the breaking of the screen in the Partzuf called "world," while Adam's %0a%3c sin is the breaking, disappearance of the screen in the Partzuf called "soul." %0a%3c The difference between these two Partzufim is that the Partzuf called "world" is %0a%3c external with regard to the inner Partzuf called "soul." The soul exists within the %0a%3c world and is sustained by it. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 328 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The breaking has its causes and consequences. It is necessary for mixing %0a%3c all the properties of Bina and Malchut, and must transpire both in the spiritual %0a%3c world and within the soul, to impart the properties of Bina to Malchut, and thus %0a%3c enable her to correct herself. %0a%3c %0a%3c The breaking of the world of Nekudim led to the breaking of the eight %0a%3c Sefirot Hesed-Gevura-2/3 of Tifferet and 1/3 of Tifferet-Netzah-Hod-Yesod-Malchut, %0a%3c four Sefirot H-B-ZA-M in each one that in turn consists of ten Sefirot, in all: %0a%3c 8 x 4 x 10 = 320 (SHACH) parts. As a result of the mixing of all the parts, %0a%3c each part in turn consists of 320 parts. All of these 320 parts, called Nitzotzin %0a%3c (sparks), acquired the egoistic will to enjoy by receiving the Creator's Light, %0a%3c which signifies their descent into the impure forces. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c /ision the reception of lower properties as a descent, the reception of %0a%3c spiritual properties as an ascent, the attainment of equivalence of forr %0a%3c union, and the emergence of a new property as separation. The appearance %0a%3c of egoistic desires in a spiritual object is considered a descent into the impure %0a%3c forces, although these forces exist within us (and not vice versa), and simply %0a%3c )me more apparent. There is nothing surrounding us, for everything %0a%3c the worlds and desires, both pure and impure. %0a%3c %0a%3c By studying Kabbalah we attract the emanation of the Light that surr %0a%3c il (see "Introduction to The Study of Ten Sefirot," item 155), %0a%3c ;s within us a desire for correction. Then, as we attain the degrees o %0a%3c spiritual worlds, we begin to feel the spiritual Light that corresponds to each %0a%3c degree, through which we begin to discern egoistic and altruistic parts in each %0a%3c of our properties. %0a%3c %0a%3c By comparisons to the Light, we perceive our egoistic parts as evil, and to %0a%3c the extent that we sense it, we distance ourselves from it and refuse to use these %0a%3c desires. Conversely, we perceive our altruistic desires as good for us, but, having %0a%3c strength to use them, we submit a request, receive the necessary strength, ar %0a%3c ie Light for the Creator's sake, thereby ascending to a higher deg %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The return (Teshuva— repentance) means that by raising MAN (request for %0a%3c correction), we elevate some of the 320 corrupt parts from the impure forces, %0a%3c into which they fell, back to the world of Atzilut, where they existed prior to %0a%3c Adam's sin. However, we are powerless to sort out and correct, i.e., to elevate the %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Heaven and Earth %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 329 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c thirty-two parts of Malchut herself, which exist in the eight Sefirot of this Partzuf %0a%3c (world), for their level of corruption is beyond our ability to repair them. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, out of the 320 (SHACH = Shin + Chet = 300 + 20) parts, we can, %0a%3c that is, we are entitled to and must sort out and correct only 320 - 32 = 288 %0a%3c parts (RAPACH = 288) by our return to the Creator, i.e., 9 x 32, where nine %0a%3c designates the first nine Sefirot in each Sefira that we are allowed to correct. %0a%3c Yet, we are unable to correct Malchut of each Sefira, for this requires a Light %0a%3c of a special power. We will receive this Light from the Creator only after the %0a%3c correction of all the other 288 parts, that is, at the end of correction. %0a%3c %0a%3c These thirty-two parts of Malchut, which are impossible and thus prohibited %0a%3c to correct, are called Lev HaEven (Lamed-Bet Even— thirty-two stones). As I've %0a%3c repeatedly mentioned, there is no such notion as "prohibition" in Kabbalah; %0a%3c this word is used when it is necessary to point out the futility of trying despite %0a%3c one's weakness and limitation. "Prohibited" means impossible, beyond one's %0a%3c power. Moreover, it is not the Creator's prohibition; rather, as a result of one's %0a%3c personal faith and experience, one should admit that "prohibited" alludes to %0a%3c whatever is still beyond one's power to correct. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, GAR de AVI are concealed, and their Light does not shine. %0a%3c After all, for all of its ten Sefirot to shine, a Zivug needs to be made on Malchut %0a%3c herself, for Lev HaEven, the thirty-two uncorrected parts of Malchut herself are a %0a%3c supplement to their ten Sefirot. And as long as these Kelim are missing, a complete %0a%3c Zivug is impossible. However, when the complete analysis and correction of the %0a%3c 288 (RAPACH = Reish + Peh + Chet = 200 + 80 + 8 = 288) Nitzotzin is completed, %0a%3c Lev HaEven will be corrected by itself, and no effort or corrections shall be %0a%3c required on our part. %0a%3c %0a%3c So the prophet says: "A new heart also shall I give you, and a new spirit shall %0a%3c I put within you; and I shall take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and %0a%3c I shall give you a heart of flesh" (Yechezkel, 36:26). Then AVI will receive their %0a%3c Light. However, this will occur at the end of correction, and before the end of %0a%3c correction, AHP of AVI will not be able to receive correction by means of our %0a%3c return, for we will be able to correct all of our egoistic desires, except for our very %0a%3c essence, Malchut de Malchut. %0a%3c %0a%3c These angels— Aza and Azael— are the real AHP de AVI that were destroyed %0a%3c during the breaking of the vessels, and were nearly restored before the sin of %0a%3c Adam. However, Adam's sin destroyed them once more, this time until the very %0a%3c end of correction. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 330 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, both angels were complaining to the Creator about their Light, %0a%3c which has disappeared because of Adam, for they saw that there was no hope %0a%3c that Adam would correct them through his return to the Creator. Moreover, %0a%3c they saw that by his return, Adam had lowered their degree even more, for now %0a%3c the entire correction and return was limited to only 288 parts, without any %0a%3c participation or even mentioning of the thirty-two forbidden parts, Lev HaEven, %0a%3c which refer to the correction of AVI, whose Light is the Light of these angels, %0a%3c just as the Kelim of the true AHP de AVI are their Kelim. %0a%3c %0a%3c Each raising of MAN designates cutting off, separation of impurity— Lev %0a%3c HaEven— from the food, RAPACH = 288 Nitzotzin, the parts that can be corrected. %0a%3c It follows that by preventing Aza and Azael from participating in the correction %0a%3c of Lev HaEven, we lower them even more. This is why the two angels complained %0a%3c to the Creator and tried to impede Adam from returning. After all, his return %0a%3c lowers them even further, for the thirty-two parts refer to them. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, when the Creator saw that their complaints threatened to weaken %0a%3c man's strength to return to Him, He told them that Adam's sin did not spoil %0a%3c anything for them. For although there is greatness and holiness in them while %0a%3c they are in Heaven and no impure forces can cling to them, still this perfection %0a%3c is incomplete, as they cannot exist in our world, in a place of impure forces. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Creator told them: "Hence, you have lost nothing as a result of Adam's %0a%3c sin, for you are no better than him anyway, as your degree is merely the result %0a%3c of the place of your residence." And since the Creator's words constitute His %0a%3c actions, they fell instantly from Heaven to earth (into egoism, of course, not to %0a%3c the physical earth!). %0a%3c %0a%3c And since they came (spiritually descended) to the corporeal life (as %0a%3c Kabbalah defines it), they began to sort through and analyze the thirty-two parts %0a%3c of complete egoism, called the "daughters of men," of which the Torah says: %0a%3c "And the sons of great (angels) saw the daughters of men (egoistic Nukva), that %0a%3c they were fair (they saw in her an opportunity for egoistic reception of pleasure), %0a%3c and they took them as wives (used their egoistic desires), whomsoever they chose %0a%3c (they themselves chose precisely this low state)" (Beresheet, 6:2). For they did not %0a%3c want to separate the impurity of the thirty-two egoistic parts and prefer only %0a%3c 288, but took everything they wished, including Lev HaEven. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, they also transgressed with Nukva Lilit (Lilith) the sinner, and wished %0a%3c to draw the entire world toward sin, to fling it into the last stage of egoism, for %0a%3c they did not wish man to return, as it completely contradicts their root. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Heaven and Earth %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 331 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c What did the Creator do? He put them in iron chains! For the Creator saw %0a%3c that if they had the power to return to Heaven after the sin, all the people would %0a%3c fail in their attempts to aspire to the Creator in their desires, as the dominance %0a%3c of these egoistic angels (forces) in man would be too great. (Rashi— the great %0a%3c eleventh century Kabbalist and Biblical commentator— says that the entire Torah %0a%3c speaks in the words of man. Hence, everything is described in notions of time %0a%3c and sequence of events. Similarly, the Creator seemingly creates and only then %0a%3c sees the results of his work). %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, although their root is quite high, the Creator gave the root of the %0a%3c impure forces His permission to act (here we see that the Creator governs all the %0a%3c forces in creation). This root is called Barzel (iron), as it is written: "There was %0a%3c neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was in %0a%3c building" (Melachim, 1, 6:7), for iron is an impure force. %0a%3c %0a%3c And since this impure force clang to the two angels and bound them, %0a%3c as if with iron chains, by the desires that it dictates to them, such a state is %0a%3c characterized as being in the mountains of darkness, from which they can no %0a%3c longer ascend until the end of correction. %0a%3c %0a%3c And when they approach the chain of Aza and Azael, rile and rouse them, %0a%3c it designates the awakening of the fourth part of the will to receive, Malchut %0a%3c de Malchut, the greatest desire to receive, called "wrath and rage." And they %0a%3c leap over the mountains of darkness, thinking that the Creator wishes to bring %0a%3c justice upon them, for being bound by iron chains, they could not ascend to %0a%3c their roots and receive Hochma. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, this action is considered leaping, an attempt to ascend, followed %0a%3c by a fall, as a result of which they descend even deeper into the mountains of %0a%3c darkness. And they think that because of their leaps (attempts to receive the %0a%3c Light from their root), the Creator is becoming increasingly stricter with them; %0a%3c thus, they decide to stop leaping. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, even though they cannot give anything, as their attempts to reach up %0a%3c are mere leaps and falls, it is nonetheless enough for the two rulers to receive Ohr %0a%3c Hochma from them, as this gives them the strength to swim in the sea of Hochma %0a%3c of the impure force, whereas before they had only the strength to bathe in it. %0a%3c %0a%3c The reason for this is that there is no action in this exalted impure force, %0a%3c and everything is limited only in thoughts and desires, for such is the essence %0a%3c of the impure forces (desires) that separate us from the Creator— before the level %0a%3c of an action is achieved, purity disappears from it. Therefore, the impure forces %0a%3c will never reach the level of an action. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 332 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, the work for the impure forces is called Avoda Zara (alien work or %0a%3c idol worshipping), as it is alien to spiritual work "for the Creator's sake," and %0a%3c is performed according to the instruction and desires that the impure forces %0a%3c insert into man's thoughts. In this alien work for an alien master, the Creator %0a%3c punishes even for mere thoughts and desires, as the prophet said: "That %0a%3c the house of Israel may understand in their own heart" (Yechezkel, 14:5). %0a%3c And the sages have said that man is accused and punished even for thoughts, %0a%3c desires, and doubts in the alien work that transpires in his heart in exactly the same %0a%3c measure as for a completed action. Hence, the leaps of Aza and Azael are sufficient %0a%3c in their desire to receive Hochma, although in reality they received nothing. %0a%3c %0a%3c 157. And these two Creator-appointed rulers swim in the Great Sea, fly up %0a%3c from there, and at night go to Naamah, the mother of witches, for whom the %0a%3c first people fell (Beresheet, 6:1-4). And they wish to approach her, but she %0a%3c leaps 60,000 Parsa'ot and assumes several different forms, so that people may %0a%3c be deceived and enticed by her. %0a%3c %0a%3c After receiving power from Aza and Azael, they can now make a Zivug with %0a%3c Naamah, as the first angels Aza and Azael erred. From that Zivug with Aza and %0a%3c Azael, Naamah gave birth to all the spirits and witches of the world. The Torah %0a%3c calls Aza and Azael the "sons of Gods" or the "sons of the great" (Beresheet, 6:2). %0a%3c %0a%3c Yet, how could such exalted angels stoop to such depraved actions with %0a%3c Naamah, and why did she give birth to spirits and witches, and not to people? %0a%3c %0a%3c The thing is that the Upper World (AVI) was created by the letter Yod, by the %0a%3c male part, which have nothing of the fourth part of Malchut, called Malchut de %0a%3c Malchut. However, ZON (the lower world) was created by the letter Hey, which %0a%3c includes Malchut de Malchut. AVI aspire only to Ohr Hassadim, to altruistic %0a%3c actions (bestowal), for Bina emerged as such in the four stages of Malchut s birth, %0a%3c even before the appearance of the first Kli (Malchut de Malchut). %0a%3c %0a%3c Nevertheless, ZON need Ohr Hochma, since ZA was created as such in the %0a%3c four stages of Malchut 's birth. Also, ZA wishes to receive Ohr Hochma within Ohr %0a%3c Hassadim, which he already has. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zivug of AVI, called the "Upper World," begets angels who desire Ohr %0a%3c Hassadim, just like AVI, from whom they were born. Human souls are born from %0a%3c the Zivug of ZON, called the "lower world," and they, like ZON, from whom %0a%3c they were born, desire only Ohr Hochma. %0a%3c %0a%3c The moment the common soul of all the creatures (Adam) was born from %0a%3c ZON de Atzilut, ZON existed at the level of the Upper World (AVI) and clothed %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Heaven and Earth %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 333 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c it. Like AVI, they, too, ended in the letter Yod of the name HaVaYaH. And %0a%3c the letter Hey of the name HaVaYaH was concealed in their posterior side, %0a%3c Achoraim or AHP. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, Adam's level was quite high because ZON was in the Upper World %0a%3c and ended in the letter Yod. The level of ZON was that of the angels that were %0a%3c born from AVI; therewith, ZON received Ohr Hochma according to their desires, %0a%3c as ZON are meant to. %0a%3c %0a%3c As a result, ZON contain the name Elokim, Supernal Hochma, the perfection %0a%3c of the Upper World. This is because the ban of the first restriction to not receive %0a%3c Ohr Hochma does not apply to the letter Yod. Cain and Abel were born from this %0a%3c state: Cain was born from ELEH and Abel from MI. Malchut herself (the last %0a%3c letter Hey of the name HaVaYaH) was concealed in them both, and only the %0a%3c letter Yod was revealed; hence, they contained Supernal Hochma. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, on the whole, Hochma is received in Kelim ELEH, ZAT de Bina, %0a%3c by Cain's soul. This property of Cain is concealed in MI, as the last Hey is %0a%3c concealed inside Yod, and Cain wanted to make a Zivug with it, to receive Ohr %0a%3c Hochma in Malchut de Malchut, concealed in Abel's soul. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is by this that he slew Abel, for after the last Hey was revealed, the ban %0a%3c of the first restriction to receive Ohr Hochma in it was revealed. Hence, the %0a%3c Creator's name Elokim disappeared from them both: MI, since it refers to GAR, %0a%3c ascended and disappeared (signifying Abel's slaying), and Cain's ELEH, since it %0a%3c refers to ZAT, fell into the impure forces, called Arka. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, although it fell into the impure forces, sparks of Ohr Hochma still %0a%3c remain in these Kelim (desires), as it is written that his daughters did not suffer %0a%3c from it greatly, and the sparks of Bina still remained in them. From this we can %0a%3c understand that Naamah, one of Cain's daughters, was the most beautiful of all %0a%3c the women in the world, for the sin transpired mainly in Cain's male part, and %0a%3c not in his female part, as is described in the Talmud (Sanhedrin, 74:2). %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, after the Creator cast Aza and Azael into this world (created by %0a%3c the letter Hey), and they've seen Naamah, a new hitherto non-existent desire %0a%3c appeared within them— the desire to receive Ohr Hochma, for in their essence %0a%3c they desire only Ohr Hassadim, and only the image of Naamah bore a new desire %0a%3c for Ohr Hochma within them. %0a%3c %0a%3c And since there is no Hey (the last Hey, on which there is a ban to receive %0a%3c Ohr Hochma) in their essence and in that of Naamah (the last revealed one, for %0a%3c it originates from Cain's ELEH), they erred in her, thinking that she is able to %0a%3c receive Ohr Hochma, and made a Zivug with her. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 334 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Their error was twofold: %0a%3c %0a%3c 1. Despite the fact that they do not have the last Hey from birth, since %0a%3c the place determines, and they exist in this world, the last Hey already %0a%3c governs them, and they are forbidden to receive Ohr Hochma. %0a%3c %0a%3c 2. They thought that the last Hey was absent in Naamah's structure, %0a%3c when in fact, it was concealed. Hence, spirits and witches were born %0a%3c from their Zivug. %0a%3c %0a%3c From this we can understand what is written in the Talmud (Hagiga, 16:1), %0a%3c that witches are half-angels half-people, for with regard to their fathers, Aza and %0a%3c Azael, they are angels, whereas with regard to Naamah, they are like people. But %0a%3c she could not give birth to people, for the seed within her came from angels, %0a%3c and not from people. %0a%3c %0a%3c The reason for the harm that they cause lies in the fact that they were born %0a%3c from depravity, the greatest possible distance from the Creator. Hence, their %0a%3c impurity accompanies them and brings harm wherever it possibly can. Therefore, %0a%3c The Zohar says that at night they come to Naamah, the mother of witches, for %0a%3c whom the first people fell (see Beresheet, 6:1-4). %0a%3c %0a%3c Indeed, after they received strength from these angels, who were the first to %0a%3c engage in depravity with Naamah, they could continue to engage in depravity %0a%3c with her. The Zohar indicates that this is precisely why they come at night, for the %0a%3c power of Hochma of the impure forces rules only in the darkness of night, the %0a%3c time of judgment and restrictions, and also as the consequence of roots, namely %0a%3c Aza and Azael, who reside in the mountains of darkness. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, after engaging in depravity with them, she leapt 60,000 Parsa'ot, %0a%3c i.e., she rose so high that she wanted to annul the Parsa below VAK de AA, whose %0a%3c each Sefira is defined as 10,000; hence, its VAK = 6 Sefirot equal 60,000. %0a%3c %0a%3c But as soon as they think to approach her, she leaps 60,000 Parsa'ot, but %0a%3c immediately falls back down and is unable to touch them, for there is no action %0a%3c in these upper impure forces, and all transgressions and all errors are only in %0a%3c thoughts and intentions. %0a%3c %0a%3c Yet, there is still enough power in her to deceive and entice people, even %0a%3c if man does not reach the level of impure actions and is only drawn to her in %0a%3c his thoughts and desires. However, the Creator punishes for such thoughts and %0a%3c desires, as He does for actions, as the prophet warns us: "the house of Israel may %0a%3c understand in their own heart" (Yechezkel, 14:5). And the impure force assumes %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Heaven and Earth %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 335 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c several different shapes, such as depravity with married women, murder and %0a%3c other things laid upon Lilit. %0a%3c %0a%3c 158. These two rulers soar in the entire world and then return to their %0a%3c places. And they rouse the sons of Cain's sons with a spirit of evil desires to %0a%3c beget children. %0a%3c %0a%3c "Soar in the entire world"— they bring harm to man in all of their thoughts, %0a%3c wherever they can, and lure him into the darkness of night. For after man sins, %0a%3c they return to their permanent place in Arka, where they rouse the sons of Cain %0a%3c to defile the descendants with impurities. %0a%3c %0a%3c Moreover, The Zohar says that besides pushing the sons of Cain to sin in Arka, %0a%3c they also soar in our world (Tevel), and compel the sons of this land to sin. %0a%3c %0a%3c 159. The Heavens that rule there are not like ours, and the land bears neither %0a%3c seed nor fruit by the power of Heaven, as ours does, and the grains grow again %0a%3c only once in several years. Hence, it is written of them that they could not correct %0a%3c Shemaya and Arka, and perished from the Supernal land, called Tevel, where %0a%3c they will not be able to exist, nor rule over it, nor cause human beings to sin %0a%3c because of the night. Hence, they disappeared from Arka and from the place of %0a%3c Shemaya that were created by the name ELEH (as mentioned in item 14). %0a%3c %0a%3c Our Heavens receive the Light essential for the birth of subsequent Partzufim %0a%3c from ZA, which has Ohr Hochma. Hence, our land, which receives in Malchut de %0a%3c ZA, receives a grain and a seed. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, the Heavens in Arka do not have the Light to bear fruit and give %0a%3c birth due to the rule of the impure forces that are there. Hence, unlike our land, %0a%3c Arka cannot produce; its land has no power to receive and grow a seed, and this %0a%3c property appears in it only once in several years. %0a%3c %0a%3c Here The Zohar speaks of the two rulers: Afriron and Kastimon, who could %0a%3c not correct Shemaya and Arka, to make them bear fruit. Therefore, these rulers %0a%3c are not allowed to be here and seduce people in our land (Tevel), to sin, for %0a%3c when they are here, they bring harm to our land so as to make it like their %0a%3c Shemaya and Arka. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, The Zohar says that they disappeared from the Supernal land of %0a%3c Tevel, from our land, for here they sought to bring harm by the power of the %0a%3c night. They provoke people toward sin by virtue of the night, and it is a curse %0a%3c that hangs over Arka because of their rule there. %0a%3c %0a%3c Our Heavens were created by the name ELEH, for our Heavens receive %0a%3c from ZA, which was corrected by ELEH's properties, by the words: IN THE %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 336 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BEGINNING THE CREATOR CREATED, where MI is connected to ELEH. %0a%3c Hence, our land is corrected by the Supernal holiness and purity. Therefore, %0a%3c these two rulers are not allowed to rule here. %0a%3c %0a%3c 160. Hence, there exists a Targum, a translation (from Hebrew to Aramaic, %0a%3c which The Zohar dubs Targum), so the holy angels will not think that it %0a%3c is said about them, so they will not harm us. This is the secret of the word %0a%3c ELEH— as we have already stated, it is a holy word that cannot be translated %0a%3c into a Targum. %0a%3c %0a%3c Everything but the word ELEH has been translated into the language of %0a%3c the Targum, as it is said in item 149, that ELEH disappeared from both Arka %0a%3c and Shemaya, for the word ELEH is untranslatable, as it constitutes the full %0a%3c connection between ELEH and MI, which causes the descent of Ohr Hochma. %0a%3c And should anyone sin and corrupt the letters ELEH, as Cain had done, they %0a%3c would fall to the impure forces, so even the holiness of the Targum (VAK of the %0a%3c pure forces) would depart from them. %0a\ No newline at end of file%0a
