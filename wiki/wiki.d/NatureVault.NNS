The design philosophy here is a cheap, easy to mass produce, organically enhanced, fully natural (no artificial chelators), hydroponic solution which has the missing nutrition of all the Hoagland clones like General Hydroponics and others.  Also it will be a fully water soluble powder mix primarily, never a plastic jug on a shelf amidst the sea of others.%0a%0aThe most premium is a Freeze Dried Compost Tea, but that will be an order of magnitude more expensive than this.%0a%0aWe are going to start with a Hoagland-esce solution, but study plant cell culture medium and also use all knowledge we have and can gain of natural plant based extracts commonly used in the nutritional industry as well as the cell culture industry.%0a%0aMakes 1 kg DRY MIX (add 5.9g of mix to 1 Liter of DI H20; 22.3g/Gal; 70g/3.2Gal; 1kg/46Gal%0a%0aDesigned to run at full strength with fogponics (ultrasonic fogger).

Shilajit very expensive may want to lower to 10g, if you do you will save 50 cents per 70g.%0a%0aI developed it by looking at Murashige and Skoog medium (MS) and Hoagland's Solution.  MS Media is a plant cell culture media so is not just everything a normal plant needs, but everything it can use.  Ammonia is omitted and replaced with Nitrates because why should we work with nasty and volatile (not to mention highly regulated) ammonia when plants don't require it?  B vitamins are replaced with yeast extract which contains them.  EDTA that toxic and environmental persistant chelator is replaced with extra glycine which is an excellent natural Iron chelator.  Manganese is lowered since it can build up in plants to levels that aren't needed and potentially toxic to humans.  Sucrose is removed since adult plants don't need it, it adds tons of extra bulk (you can add it yourself if you are using this for cell culture), and will make our solution go bad quicker in nutrient tanks.  Dead Sea Salts (and Calcium Nitrate) are added instead of Calcium Chloride since they contain these minerals and other important ones including a bit of Sodium Chloride.  Copper Sulfate was removed because yeast extract and likely bamboo extract alone provided enough of this nutrient.  All of the extracts are added at intelligent but arbitrary levels so nutrient profiles of these should eventually be taken and levels adjusted accordingly.  Potassium iodide is replaced with Kelp Extract.  Extracts containing Silica and Selenium were added because who in their right mind thinks plants don't need these?%0a%0aDead sea salts set at 0.140 g/L so chloride is around 70ppm. Lowered Potassium nitrate and boosted calcium nitrate so I could raise potassium phosphate to be about 1/7th of the combined nitrates.%0a%0aLowered Potassium nitrate by 1 g/L and replaced it by 1.8g of amino acids since aminos on average have 1/3 the nitrogen as nitrate (potassium nitrate is 60%25 nitrate).%0a%0aSodium BHB is an all natural sodium source that contains a GABA precursor that may help the plants uptake more Nitrogen.  Also it is a Chloride free source of sodium since chloride over 30ppm hurts plants.  Also BHB (Beta-hydroxybutyrate) is a fatty acid so should help the plant generate fatty molecules.%0a%0aAmino acids were added to maintain very high nitrogen but staying under 250ppm of Nitrate for plant health.  Also they help chelate minerals.%0a%0aMagnesium Bis-Glycinate provides helpful glycine which is a great natural chelator amino acid and also provides a sulfate free magnesium source to keep sulfate under 100ppm.%0a%0aMy vision for this, besides just a great cheap organic hydroponic solution for everyone and getting people to produce food locally,  is countries in Africa can make this themselves, distribute it to their people, and Africa can become the "bread basket" (or at least vegetable basket) of the world.  I can see them excelling in hydroponics for their great sunlight and also work ethic of the people.  Also instead of other countries giving Africa food aid, why not give them these minerals which are much lighter to ship and the people can grow their own food?%0a%0aAmazon list for Fogponic Setup:%0ahttps://a.co/1ufc70F%0a%0aResources:%0ahttps://www.dropbox.com/sh/eokcmz9lzxk5tpg/AAD2KmAow52xlb1uUv0iM9E7a?dl=1%0a%0aplant culture media comparison%0ahttp://www.biologydiscussion.com/plants/plant-tissue-culture/plant-tissue-culture-media-types-constituents-preparation-and-selection/10656%0a%0aPlant cell culture media explanation%0ahttps://www.intechopen.com/books/recent-advances-in-plant-in-vitro-culture/plant-tissue-culture-media%0a%0aglycine based chelators%0ahttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aminopolycarboxylic_acid%0a%0afogponic system, possibly use higher nutrient solution concentration without burning roots%0a%0asolution chiller, plug into fogger timer up to 120 w.

The design philosophy here is a cheap, easy to mass produce, organically enhanced, fully natural (no artificial chelators), hydroponic solution which has the missing nutrition of all the Hoagland clones like General Hydroponics and others.  Also it will be a fully water soluble powder mix primarily, never a plastic jug on a shelf amidst the sea of others.%0a%3c %0a%3c The most premium is a Freeze Dried Compost Tea, but that will be an order of magnitude more expensive than this.%0a%3c %0a%3c We are going to start with a Hoagland-esce solution, but study plant cell culture medium and also use all knowledge we have and can gain of natural plant based extracts commonly used in the nutritional industry as well as the cell culture industry.%0a%3c %0a%3c Makes 1 kg DRY MIX (add 5.9g of mix to 1 Liter of DI H20; 22.3g/Gal; 70g/3.2Gal; 1kg/46Gal%0a%3c %0a%3c Designed to run at full strength with fogponics (ultrasonic fogger).

Shilajit very expensive may want to lower to 10g, if you do you will save 50 cents per 70g.%0a%3c %0a%3c I developed it by looking at Murashige and Skoog medium (MS) and Hoagland's Solution.  MS Media is a plant cell culture media so is not just everything a normal plant needs, but everything it can use.  Ammonia is omitted and replaced with Nitrates because why should we work with nasty and volatile (not to mention highly regulated) ammonia when plants don't require it?  B vitamins are replaced with yeast extract which contains them.  EDTA that toxic and environmental persistant chelator is replaced with extra glycine which is an excellent natural Iron chelator.  Manganese is lowered since it can build up in plants to levels that aren't needed and potentially toxic to humans.  Sucrose is removed since adult plants don't need it, it adds tons of extra bulk (you can add it yourself if you are using this for cell culture), and will make our solution go bad quicker in nutrient tanks.  Dead Sea Salts (and Calcium Nitrate) are added instead of Calcium Chloride since they contain these minerals and other important ones including a bit of Sodium Chloride.  Copper Sulfate was removed because yeast extract and likely bamboo extract alone provided enough of this nutrient.  All of the extracts are added at intelligent but arbitrary levels so nutrient profiles of these should eventually be taken and levels adjusted accordingly.  Potassium iodide is replaced with Kelp Extract.  Extracts containing Silica and Selenium were added because who in their right mind thinks plants don't need these?%0a%3c %0a%3c Dead sea salts set at 0.140 g/L so chloride is around 70ppm. Lowered Potassium nitrate and boosted calcium nitrate so I could raise potassium phosphate to be about 1/7th of the combined nitrates.%0a%3c %0a%3c Lowered Potassium nitrate by 1 g/L and replaced it by 1.8g of amino acids since aminos on average have 1/3 the nitrogen as nitrate (potassium nitrate is 60%25 nitrate).%0a%3c %0a%3c Sodium BHB is an all natural sodium source that contains a GABA precursor that may help the plants uptake more Nitrogen.  Also it is a Chloride free source of sodium since chloride over 30ppm hurts plants.  Also BHB (Beta-hydroxybutyrate) is a fatty acid so should help the plant generate fatty molecules.%0a%3c %0a%3c Amino acids were added to maintain very high nitrogen but staying under 250ppm of Nitrate for plant health.  Also they help chelate minerals.%0a%3c %0a%3c Magnesium Bis-Glycinate provides helpful glycine which is a great natural chelator amino acid and also provides a sulfate free magnesium source to keep sulfate under 100ppm.%0a%3c %0a%3c My vision for this, besides just a great cheap organic hydroponic solution for everyone and getting people to produce food locally,  is countries in Africa can make this themselves, distribute it to their people, and Africa can become the "bread basket" (or at least vegetable basket) of the world.  I can see them excelling in hydroponics for their great sunlight and also work ethic of the people.  Also instead of other countries giving Africa food aid, why not give them these minerals which are much lighter to ship and the people can grow their own food?%0a%3c %0a%3c Amazon list for Fogponic Setup:%0a%3c https://a.co/1ufc70F%0a%3c %0a%3c Resources:%0a%3c https://www.dropbox.com/sh/eokcmz9lzxk5tpg/AAD2KmAow52xlb1uUv0iM9E7a?dl=1%0a%3c %0a%3c plant culture media comparison%0a%3c http://www.biologydiscussion.com/plants/plant-tissue-culture/plant-tissue-culture-media-types-constituents-preparation-and-selection/10656%0a%3c %0a%3c Plant cell culture media explanation%0a%3c https://www.intechopen.com/books/recent-advances-in-plant-in-vitro-culture/plant-tissue-culture-media%0a%3c %0a%3c glycine based chelators%0a%3c https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aminopolycarboxylic_acid%0a%3c %0a%3c fogponic system, possibly use higher nutrient solution concentration without burning roots%0a%3c %0a%3c solution chiller, plug into fogger timer up to 120 w.
