The entire fee goes directly to holders just like Tian.  But Tian mints the same amount of coins fresh, making holders not gain much value over time.  In Basilico, only 38%25 of the fee is created as new coins, so holders are gaining many more coins from the fees than they are getting diluted.

However coins can only be minted if there are less than ~ 4,000 coins left for sale.  So this will mean that before a monthly drop can happen, nearly all the coins need to have been bought up already.
