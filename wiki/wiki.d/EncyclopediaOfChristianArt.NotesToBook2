VII.,  VIII. %0a%0aGrains  of  sand  (or  silica,)  and  natron  (or  the  carbonates  of  potash %0aand  soda,)  having  been  known  from  the  earliest  period,  it  is  pro- %0abable that  the  origin  of  glass  would  date  from  the  highest  anti- %0aquity. %0a%0aThe  Egyptians  had  at  a  remote  period  heated  these  alkaline %0asilicates  in  contact  with  the  metallic  oxides,  at  Thebes  and  Mem- %0aphis, and  in  their  temple  of  **  Ptha  *'  or  Fire,  devoted  to  the  prac- %0atice of  their  occult  chemical  arts '. %0a%0a"  I  have  often  found  in  the  ruins  of  ancient  cities  of  the %0aThebaid,"  writes  M.  Roziere,  **  amongst  the  fragments  of  coloured %0aglass  with  which  they  abound,  some  pieces  tinted  with  various %0acolours.  Many  of  them,  affording  in  some  of  their  parts,  beautiful %0atints  of  purple,  were,  I  think,  remains  of  the  ancient  artificial %0a%3c•  vasa  murrhina  *' — frits,  glasses,  enamels,  are  also  found,  coloured %0aby  metallic  oxides^. %0a%0aThe  Phoenicians  having  traded  in  the  glass  of  Thebes,  became %0athemselves  famous  in  the  art  of  its  manufacture.  The  tale  of  the %0afortuitous  discovery  of  glass  by  them,  related  by  Pliny  ^  and  fre- %0aquently quoted,  is  stated  by  Merret,  upon  the  authority  of  the %0amost  experienced,  to  be  impossible,  as  even  by  the  most  violent %0afire  glass  cannot  be  made,  in  any  quantity,  by  burning  substances, %0afit  for  its  composition,  in  the  open  air. %0a%0a'  Eircher,  (Edip.

For,  owing  to  the  presence  of  metallic  oxides  in  the %0aalkaline  carbonate,  or  the  quartsous  fragments,  the  production  of %0aa  coloured  glass  would  be  of  earlier  date  than  a  pure  and  colour- %0aless vitrification.  Theophilus  provides  for  the  casual  colouring %0aof  the  **  metal  "  through  the  mixture  of  metallic  oxides  with  its %0aelements. %0a%0a%0aThe  divers  colours  of  glass  not  transparent,  which  Theophilus %0atells  us,  c.  xii.,  were  found  in  the  edifices  of  the  Pagans,  in  mosaic %0awork,  were  doubtless  of  the  kind  which  were  seen  in  Egypt  by %0aM.  de  Roziere,  and  the  art  of  making  which  was  transmitted  to %0athe  Greeks.  Pliny  ^  remarks  upon  a  manufacture  imitating  the  ob- %0asidian stone,  "  Obsidian  stone  is  also  made  in  stained  fashion,  for %0avessels  of  repast,  and  a  perfectly  red  glass  and  not  Not  Trans- %0alucent, called  hsematinon.  Whitb  is  also  made  and  Murrhinum %0a(purple),  or  Hyacinth  and  Safphirb,  and  imitation  in  All %0aOther  Colours."  In  the  previous  chapter  Pliny  mentions  that %0apavements  and  other  ornaments  in  glass  were  used  by  Agrippa  in %0athe  construction  of  his  baths.  This  kind  of  mosaic  work,  then, %0aserved  the  Byzantine  artists  in  the  construction  of  the  enamelled %0avases  which  were  so  beautiful  in  colour  and  are  now  so  rare. %0aThese  enamels  are  all  opaque,  and  present  the  appearance  of  the %0afinest  mosaics.  Theophilus  tells  us  that  white,  black,  green^ %0ayellow,  blue,  red  and  purple  glass,  found  also  in  the  form  of %0autensils,  were  used  for  this  work  by  the  French,  who  were  al- %0aready "  skilful  in  the  art  "  of  working  glass.  Pliny,  indeed, %0astates  that  Italy,  Gaul,  and  Spain,  pursued  the  manufacture  of %0aglass. %0a%0aThis  opaque  glass  was,  doubtless,  the  Vitrum  Rouanum  of %0aEraclius,  some  of  whose  chapters  are  quoted  by  Theophilus  at  the %0aend  of  the  third  book. %0a%0a'  Plinii,  Nat.

They  have  been  abstracted  from  the  original  manu- %0ascript, now  lost,  as  it  is  seen  elsewhere  that  the  oldest  copy  of %0aTheophilus  known,  that  in  the  Imperial  Library  at  Vienna,  also %0awants  them,  as  do  the  Wolfenbiittel  and  Nani  MSS.  Having  the %0atitles  of  these  chapters  in  the  index  it  will  perhaps  be  possible  to %0areplace  this  lacuna  with  the  matter,  if  not  in  the  words  of  Theo- %0aphilus, by  consulting*  the  preceding  or  cotemporaneous  Byzantine %0aworks,  in  which  this  subject  is  discussed. %0a%0aC.  xii.

These  are  the  titles  of  the %0amissing  chapters,  and  they  unfortunately  leave  a  great  void  in  the %0ahistory  of  Hie  art  of  the  period  at  which  Theophilus  wrote.  It  is %0anot  to  be  doubted  that,  notwithstanding  the  resources  of  the %0amodern  artificer  in  the  advances  and  the  aid  of  science,  some  of %0athe  compositions,  of  material,  of  the  ancients  are  in  vain  sought  in %0aour  day,  although  a  portion  of  our  glass  painters  refuse  to  acknow- %0aledge the  fact.  Where  is  to  be  seen  in  the  atelier  of  to-day  the %0afinest  and  peculiar  **  blue  "  traceable  until  the  end  of  the  fifteenth %0acentury?  Cobalt  will  not  produce  this  colour ;  or  if  so,  of  what  use %0ais  our  vaunted  advance  in  chemical  science,  if  it  yet  remains  a  pro- %0ablem ?  Should  one  novelty  be  produced  from  the  perusal  of  the %0afollowing  extracts,  they  will  have  been  found  worthy  the  perusal %0aof  the  artist,  and  they  will  repay  the  labour  of  research. %0a%0a%0aOF  GREEN  GLASS. %0a%0aOlympiodorus  of  Alexandria,  who  wrote  at  the  commencement %0aof  the  third  century,  and  a  manuscript  of  whom  upon  the  *'  sacred %0aart"  of  alchemy  is  in  the  Biblioth^que  Royale  at  Paris,  No.  %25250, %0agives  us  the  mode  of  imitating  the  emerald. %0a%0aM  2 %0a%0a%0a164  NOTES   TO    BOOK    II. %0a%0a"  Take  two  ounces  of  fine  crystal  and  half  an  ounce  of  calcined %0acopper,  ;^aXxot;  xntetvfAipovf  grind  these  substances  in  a  mortar,  and %0amelt  them  together  by  an  equal  fire,  la-tt  vi/^»." %0a%0aIn  the  Byzantine  MS.  given  by  Muratori^  already  referred  to, %0athe  composition  of  a  green  glass  is  found,  p.  370  K %0a%0a"  DE   TINCTIO   VIT&I   PRASINI." %0a%0aTere  vitrum  bene,  limas  heramen  mundum,  et  mittes  in  libraa %0ade  viturum,  heramen  ^  III,  et  coques  per  dies  III. — "  Grind %0aglass  well^  file  clean  bronse,  (or  copper,)  and  put,  to  a  pound  of %0aglass,  three  '  sesunciie,*  (a  sesuncia  is  about  1^  ounce,)  and  cook %0afor  three  days.'* %0a%0aALIA   TINCTIO. %0a%0a**  Teres   vitrum  bene.

Having  already  remarked  upon  what  may  be  regarded  as %0athe  sapphire  of  the  Greeks,  in  a  note  to  the  first  book  (p.  77, %0aet  seq.),  I  do  no  more  than  call  the  attention  of  the  reader  to  the %0aopinion  there  expressed  that  the  Za^r^u^of  of  the  ancient  Greeks %0awas  our  lapis  lazuli.

After  directing  that  the  crystal  be %0aseveral  times  heated  and  well  washed,  it  proceeds— %0a%0a*'  Vous  prendrez  un  pot  de  terre  plumbe  de  dens,  et  pus  si %0apernez  une  livre  de  vostre  poudre  de  cristas  et  de  mye  lyvre  de %0avostre  sel  niter  et  de  sans  de  verre,  vi  medlez  ove  vostre  poudre %0ade  cristal,  yous  le  criblez  bien  ensemble  vi  les  metez  en  vostre  pot %0avi  covrierez  eel  pot  de  un  covered  ke  seyt  en  milu  perce.

Afler  describing  the  manufacture  of  white  glass» %0aEraclius  proceeds  to  direct  the  colouring  of  it. %0a%0a''Si  vero  vis  ut  efficiatur  rubeum  de  cinere  tamen'  bene  cocto %0asic  facies." %0a%0a^  "  But  should  you  wish  to  make  a  red  from  the  '  ashes/  well %0acooked,  however^  you  act  thus.

"  VITRUM  CLARISSIMUM,  VELUT %0aCRYSTALLUM,  QUOD  IPSI  COMPONUNT." %0a%0aThe  ''very  clear  glass  like  crystal"  used  by  the  Greeks,  in %0aorder  to  attach  gold  leaf  to  vases,  and  which  ia  C.  xiv.  is  employed %0aupon  an  ornament  of  gold,  or  silver,  previously  laid  upon  glass,  is %0ano  other  than  a  flux  capable  of  retaining  and  combining,  by  the %0aaction  of  fire,  with  the  various  vitreous  colouring  substances  after- %0awards superposed.  This  last  chapter  indeed  proves  that  the %0aByzantine  Greeks  practised  the  art  of  Paintiho  upon  Glass,  an %0aart  which  all  the  French  writers,  from  Le  Viel  to  M.  E.  Thibaud, %0awith  perhaps  a  laudable  partiality,  labour  to  prove  of  French %0aorigin,  and  of  the  twelfth  or  thirteenth  century. %0a%0aEmeric  David^  indeed,  in  exception,  mentions  that  the  historian %0aof  the  monastery  of  St.  Begnine,  who  wrote  about  1052,  declares %0athat  there  existed,  yet  in  his  timCf  in  the  church  of  the  monastery, %0aa  very  ancient  glass  window,  representing  the  martyrdom  of  St. %0aPaschasie,  and  that  this  painting  had  been  taken  from  the  old %0achurch,  restored  by  Charles  the  Bald,  (a.  d.  850,)  **  vr  qujbdah %0aviTREA  ANTiauiTus  FACTA,  et  usquc  ad  nostra  perdurans  tempora, %0aelegant!  praemonstrabat  picturft." %0a%0aThe  Benedictines  have  ascribed  this  invention  to  the  period  of %0aCharlemagne,  T.  6,  p.  66,  and  with  more  reason.  For  Theo- %0aphilus  not  only  describes  the  ornamenting  of  cups,'  vases,  and %0aother  utensils,  by  means  of  coloured  glass  fluxed  upon  a  white %0aground ;  but  in  C.  fil  are  found  clear  directions  for  painting  upon %0aglass.  "  In  the  same  manner  you  make  grounds  of  the  clearest %0awhite,  the  figures  of  which  grounds  you  ornament  with  sapphire, %0agreen,  purple,  and  red."  The  dark  colour  is  to  take  the  place  of %0apose  in  marking  the  nude,  &c. %0a%0aTraces  of  a  flux  for  the  purpose  of  ornamenting  vases,  whether %0aof  glass  or  earthenware,  are  found  scattered  through  the  books  of %0aEraclius.  The  art  of  rendering  glass  more  fusible  by  means  of %0alitharge  was  well  known  to  that  writer. %0a%0aA  very  curious  Manuscript  in  the  Sloane  collection,  No.  3661, %0awhich  encloses  the  practice  of  an  anonymous  alchemist  of  the  four- %0a%0a»  Emeric  David,  loc.  cit.,  p.  151. %0a%0a%0aNOTES   TO    BOOK    II.  171 %0a%0ateenth  century,  with  a  variety  of  other  matters,  contains  also  a  trea- %0atise upon  colouring  glass.

This  art  would  naturally  lead  to  that  of  painting %0aupon  glass,  the  transition  would  likewise  be  immediate.  In  chap. %0aXV.  Theophilus  informs  us  that  the  same  people  made  **  glass %0atablets,  as  in  window  work/'  which  they  ornamented  with  gold, %0alaying  a  flux  behind  the  leaf  in  order  to  protect  it.  This  was %0aprincipally  used  in  mosaic  work:  tlie  decoration  of  vases  with %0ag(dd  leaf  and  coloured  ornamental  work,  having  been  applied  to %0aglass,  as  well  as  fictile  vases  and  cups,  became  transferred  to  the %0aglass  plates,  and  thus  were  introduced  into  window-work. %0a%0aEraclius,  who  is  quoted  by  Theophilus  in  the  third  book,  gives %0aa  chapter  upon  this  subject. %0a%0aIt  would  not,  perhaps,  be  uninteresting  to  the  artist  were  I  to %0agive  an  extract  from  a  manuscript  of  Sir  T.

The  French  artists  have  noticed  this %0aeffect;  they  also  observe  that  such  a  custom  if  abused  **  fait  trou" %0ain  the  composition. %0a%0a%0aC.  XXVIII.    "  CRUCES  IN  CAPITE  MAJESTATIS." %0a%0aAt  an  epoch  when  the  painters  and  other  artists,  employed  in %0athe  decoration  o£  sacred  edifices,  were  either  belonging  to,  or %0aunder  the  influence  of  the  church,  the  laws  of  religious  icono- %0agraphy were  faithfully  observed;  the  nimbus  or  glory,  by  which  the %0aheads  of  Divine,  or  sainted,  personages  were  surrounded»  was  em- %0ablematical of  the  sacred  character.  M.  Didron,  in  the  "  Icono- %0agraphie  Chretienne,"  informs  us  that  when  a  figure  is  without  the %0animbus,  it  may  certainly  be  said  that  it  is  no  representation  of  a %0asaint. %0a%0aA  more  sacred  character  still  was  given  to  the  Divinity,  the %0aAngels  and  Apostles ;  these  were  alone  represented  with  the  feet %0auncovered.  Neither  the  Virgin  nor  other  saints  were  thus  repre- %0asented at  this  epoch. %0a%0aEvery  figure  with  the  nimbus  is  «a  saint,  every  saint  with  nude %0afeet  is  at  the  least  an  apostle ;  every  figure  with  a  nimbus  orna- %0a%0a%0aNOTES   TO    BOOK   II.  183 %0a%0amented  with  a  cross  can  be  but  one  of  the  three  Divine  personages : %0athis^  adds  M.  Didron»  is  the  invariable  rule. %0a%0aUntil  the  eleventh  century  the  Latin  church,  as  well  as  the  Greek, %0afraternized  with  the  Jewish  religion.  An  enamelled  cross  of  the %0aAbbey  of  Saint  Bertin,  a  romaic  cross  of  the  eleventh  century, %0agives  the  nimbus>  the  character  of  saint,  to  Moses,  to  his  brother %0aAaron,  to  the  prophet  who  marks  the  elect  with  the  "  than,"  to %0aIsaac,  to  Joshua  and  Caleb.  But  at  the  moment  of  the  consum- %0amation of  the  schism,  this  respect,  which  the  Latin  church  formerly %0aentertained  for  the  personages  of  the  Old  Testament,  sensibly  di- %0aminished ;  the  Byzantine  influence,  alone,  partially  preserved  it, %0abut  in  the  fourteenth  century  the  Christian  saints  only  kept  this %0aattribute.     The  Greeks  continue  the  practice  unto  this  day  ^ %0a%0a%0aC.  XXX.     QUOMODO    REPORMETUR  VAS   VITREUM %0a%0aFRACTUM. %0a%0aThis  invention  appears  to  have  been  made  in  the  reign  of %0aTiberius  Csesar,  and  to  have  led  to  the  fable  of  malleable  glass. %0aPliny,  who  has  been  quoted  by  St.  Isidore,  mentions  an  invention %0aof  a  composition,  or  tempering,  which  rendered  glass  tender,  and %0athat  Tiberius,  fearing  this  would  depreciate  the  value  of  the %0aprecious  metals,  abolished  the  workshop  of  the  artificer.  This %0astory  has  been  wonderfully  improved  by  St.  Isidore,  who  adds  a %0ahammer  to  the  tale,  and  converts  the  "tender"  or  "  tractable  glass " %0amentioned  by  Pliny  into  one  which  is  "  malleable."  Eraclius %0aquotes  from  St.  Isidore,  rather  than  from  Pliny,  whose  version  is %0atoo  plain  to  admit  of  the  marvellous. %0a%0aPliny  writes,  "  Ferunt,  Tiberio  principe,  excogitatum  vitri  tem- %0aperamentum,  ut  flexibile  esset :  et  totam  officinam  artificis  ejus %0aabolitam,  ne  »ris,  argenti,  auri,  metallis  pretia  detraherentur : %0aeaque  fama  crebrior  diu,  quam  certior  fuit."* %0a%0aSt.  Isidore,  disregarding  the  doubt  expressed  by  Pliny,  that %0aglass  could  even  be  rendered  more  tractable,  writes  ^ — "  It  is  re- %0alated that,  under  Tiberius  Caesar,  an  artificer  invented  a  tempering %0afor  glass,  which  rendered  it  tender  and  ductile  {flexibile  et  ductile^ %0a%0a'  ICsnuel  d'lconognpliie  Chr6tienne,  p.  134. %0a%0a»  Pliny.

The %0aartificer  raised  the  jar  from  the  floor,  thrust  a  small  hammer  into %0athe  cavity,  and  mended  the  jar.  This  done,  Ceesar  asked  the %0aartificer  whether  any  other  person  knew  this  tempering  for  glass» %0aand  when  he  denied,  with  an  oath,  that  any  other  knew  of  it, %0aCaesar  ordered  him  to  be  decapitated ;  lest,  this  known,  gold  and %0asilver  might  become  as  clay,  and  the  value  of  all  metals  be  debased. %0aFor,  in  truth,  did  glass  vessels  not  break  they  would  be  better %0athan  gold  or  silver." %0a%0aWe  see  that  the  relation  of  Pliny  has  been  much  improved,  and %0athat  Isidore  has  perpetrated,  or  perpetuated,  an  error  which  gave %0amuch  trouble  to  many  an  alchemist  of  the  middle  ages. %0a%0aPliny,  L.  29,  c.  3,  gives  us  the  process  usually  followed  io  his %0atime  for  cementing  broken  glass,  "  candidum  ex  his  (ovis)  admis- %0atum  calci  vivae  glutinat  vitri  fragmentaj  "  **  white  of  an  egg,  mixed %0awith  quick-lime,  glues  together  the  fragments  of  glass.'* %0a%0a%0aDE  COMPONENDIS  FENESTRIS. %0a%0aOf  the  use  of  coloured  glass  by  the  ancients  it  has  been  shown %0athat  we  have  proof.  The  enamelled  charms,  (abracadedfra^)  and %0athe  "  abaculi  "  of  the  Greeks  and  Romans,  yet  in  existence,  show %0athis.  The  Romans  employed  glass  in  the  embellishment  of  their %0aapartments,  and  Seneca  appears  to  intend  that  mirrors  were  em- %0aployed for  this  purpose,  as  at  the  present  day.  **  Pauper  sibi  vi- %0adetur  ac  sordid  us,  nisi  parietes  magnis  et  pretiosis  orbibus  refulse- %0arunt,  nisi  vitro  absconditur  camera."

Lactantius '  and %0aSt.  Jerome',  writers  of  the  third  and  fourth  centuries,  both  speak %0aof  glazed  windows.  The  employment  of  coloured  glass  arranged %0ain  Mosaic  fashion,  the  "  fenestra  simplex,"  c.  29  of  Theophilus, %0awould  soon  give  place  to  the  use  of  painted  glass  as  the  art  nd- %0avanced.  Observant  of  the  effects  of  colour  productive  of  such %0aadmiration  during  the  early  efforts  of  art,  new  exertions,  in  order %0ato  unite  the  beauty  of  pictorial  effect  with  the  previous  richness  of %0adecoration,  would  doubtless  soon  be  made  to  call  to  aid  the  talents %0aof  the  Christian  artist. %0a%0aIn  the  sixth  century,  when  Fortunatus  of  Poitiers  ^  lauds  the %0abishops  who  ornamented  their  churches  with  large  windows  of %0aglass,  and  the  effect  which  they  produced  by  the  rays  of  the  sun ; %0ahe,  by  this,  evidently  intends  a  coloured  glass. %0a%0aSidonius  Apollinaris^  in  his  letter  to  Hesperius,  speaks  positively %0aof  coloured  glass  having  been  used  in  the  windows  of  the  church %0aerected  by  Patiens,  at  Lyons. %0a%0a**  Ecclesia  nuper  constructa  est  Lugduni,  quae  studio  papae  Pa- %0atientis  ad  summum  coepti  operis  accessit,  viri  sancti,  strenui,  &c. %0a%0a"  InUu  lux  micat,  atque  bracteatinn %0aSol  sic  sollicitatur  ad  lacunar, %0aFolvo  nt  concolor  erret  in  metallo, %0aDirtinctum  vario  nitore  marmor %0aFercuirit  camerain,  solum,  feneatiasw %0aAc  tub  Tenicoloribus  figuria %0aYemans  herbida  cructa  saphiratoB %0aFlectit  per  prasinum  vitrum  lapilloa." %0a%0aFortunatus  and  Paul  the  hermit,  as  well  as  Theophilus,  de- %0ascribe the  admirable  effect  which  the  rising  sun  produced  through %0athe  windows  of  St.  Sophia  at  Constantinople.

In  c.  Ift  and  13,  Theo- %0aphilus  does  not  neglect  the  mention  of  this  process^  whereby  he %0atells  us  that  *'  the  Frsnch  made  costly  plates  of  sapphire,  purple %0aand  green,  very  useful  in  windows,"  and  in  c.  IS,  he  informs  us %0athat  the  **vitrum  clarissimum,"  used  as  a  flux,  was  composed  by  the %0aGreeks.  Theophilus,  who  asserts  that  he  has  ''  embraced  the  na- %0ature of  glass,"  subsequent  to  his  visit  to  St.  Sophia,  and  his  admir- %0aation of  the  effect  produced  by  the  different  hues  thrown  upon %0athe  chancel,  is  the  first  practical  author  who  enters  minutely  into  a %0adescription  of  the  processes  of  the  glass  painter,  and,  as  a  prac- %0atical artist,  is  the  more  worthy  of  our  serious  attention.  The %0aart  of  enamelling  glass  yras  then  known  to  the  Bysantine  Greeks ; %0athe  sutement  of  the  historian  of  the  monastery  of  St.  Begnine  is, %0atherefore,  most  credible,  although  attacked  by  the  later  French %0awriters  in  order  to  support  their  pretensions,  and  the  opinion  of %0athe  Benedictines,  that  pictorial  representation  upon  glass  dates %0afrom  the  period  of  Charlemagne,  is  supported.  The  art  of  pro- %0aducing a  picture  by  means  of  gradation  of  shadow,  thereby  forming %0acombinations  of  light,  shade,  and  colour  with  the  plate  of  stained  or %0aenamelled  glass  subjected  to  this  process,  was  the  first  and  great %0astep  taken  in  the  art  of  glass  painting.  It  is  the  process  of  Theo- %0aphilus, who,  however,  appears  to  have  entertained  the  idea  of  paint- %0aing objects  upon  glass  with  coloured  fluxes,  in  imitation  of  the %0aornaments  upon  vases  and  cups. %0a%0aThat  this  process  was  more  congenial  to  the  production  of  ex- %0acellence in  window  work  than  any  other,  the  remains  of  church %0awindows,  executed  from  the  beginning  of  the  eleventh  to  the  end  of %0athe  fifteenth  century,  are  in  evidence  to  attest. %0a%0aReasons  for  this  are  not  wanting ;  they  have  lately  been  brought %0aforward  with  great  happiness  by  the  later  writers  upon  the  art,  and %0awho  attempt  to  prove  that  in  order  to  return  to  the  excellence %0ashown  at  the  periods  above  referred  to,  the  same  simplicity  of %0ashadows  and  breadth  and  purity  of  colour  must  be  returned  to. %0a%0aThe  care  of  the  painters  of  these  later  periods  in  the  taste  and %0apurity  of  outline  is  another  cause  of  the  excellence  of  their  works- %0aOutline  and  arrangement  of  colour  were  the  points  to  which  all %0aother  considerations  properly  yielded,  in  this  mode  of  decoration, %0aviewed  by  the  means  of  transmitted  light  alone;  which  trans- %0a%0a%0aNOTES   TO    BOOK  II.  187 %0a%0amission,  while  it  was  found  to  blend  and  harmonise  the  rays  of %0acoloured  light  before  they  reached  the  observer,  rendered  nugatory, %0aor  poor,  the  greys  ^  introduced  by  yet  later  artists  in  order  to %0ablend  their  colour  with  shadow,  or  lights  as  practised  in  pictures %0aseen  by  the  means  of  reflected  light. %0a%0aThe  fact,  as  related  by  Bede,  the  Saxon  chronicler,  of  the  im- %0aportation from  France  and  Italy,  into  our  own  country,  of  arti- %0aficers in  glass,  (a.d.  674,)  by  Wilfrid,  Bishop  of  York,  and  Biscop %0ahis  friend,  had  an  important  influence  upon  this  branch  of  art  in %0aEngland.  **  When  the  work  {of  St.  Peter's)  was  far  advanced," %0awrites  Bede,  *'  he  sent  agents  to  France  to  procure,  if  possible, %0asome  glass  makers,  a  kind  of  artificers  quite  unknown  in  England, %0aand  to  bring  them  over  to  glaze  the  windows  of  his  church  and %0amonastery.  These  agents  were  successful,  and  brought  several %0aglass  makers  with  them,  who  not  only  performed  the  work  re- %0aquired by  Benedict  Biscop,  but  instructed  the  English  in  the  art %0aof  making  glass  for  windows,  lamps,  drinking  vessels,"  &c. — %0aBede,  Hist.  Abbot.  Weremuthen. %0a%0aEmeric  David  states  that  the  English,  in  their  turn,  instructed %0athe  Germans  in  this  art. %0a%0aWhile  the  influence  of  the  style  of  the  preceding  ages  was  sens- %0aibly felt  during  the  14th  century,  the  remarkable  progress  in  the %0aarts  of  painting  and  design  before  the  close  of  that  era  greatly  af- %0afected this  art,  while  at  the  same  time  the  route  previously  fol- %0alowed was  not  much  deviated  from.  The  Florentine  and.  other %0aschoc^s  of  art  had  arisen  in  Italy. %0a%0aStill  the  coloured  and  ornamented  grounds  prevailed,  the  painted %0awindows  in  the  cathedrals  of  Bourges,  Clermont,  Chartres,  &c., %0ashow  that  the  circles,  flourishes,  and  other  ornaments  of  the  11  th %0acentury,  described  by  Theophilus,  yet  held  their  places,  but  the %0asubjects  were  better  portrayed;  to  the  experience  of  the  past  wa» %0aadded  the  new-born  genius  of  Italy,  and  the  art  which  the  Bysan- %0atine  Greeks  had  transmitted  to  Western  Europe  approached  the %0asummit  of  excellence. %0a%0aI  am  not  aware  that  the  history  o£  the  processes  of  this  period %0ahave  been  at  all  inquired  into;  in  the  little  space  afforded,  in  a %0awork  of  this  nature,  I  have  endeavoured  to  collect  a  few  practical %0adirections  from  the  manuscripts  of  the  period.

Neri  ap- %0apears to  be  the  source  from  which  most  of  these  authors  have %0adrawn. %0a%0aThe  relations  which  the  Venetians  held  at  a  very  early  period %0awith  the  East,  and  the  constant  intercourse  they  maintained  with %0athe  Greeks  of  the  lower  empire,  gave  facilities  in  this  art  at %0aa  comparatively  early  period.  The  commerce  they  monopoliied %0ain  white  and  coloured  glass  became  an  important  feature  in  their %0astatistics ;  this  branch  o£  industry  and  art  might,  with  the  com- %0amand we  possess  of  material  and  facilities,  be  developed  to  a  great %0aextent  in  this  country. %0a%0aThere  are  many  processes  here  described  which  will  repay  the %0atrouble  of  perusal  to  the  most  scientific  of  our  artists ;  those, %0ahowever,  are  not  of  the  class  which  would  turn  from  any  inquiry %0aupon  the  subject  during  the  present  state  of  conflicting  opinions, %0awhen  the  very  principles  of  the  art  which  formerly  led  to  its  per- %0afection are  questioned,  or  neglected. %0a%0aThe  principles  laid  down  by  Theophilus  must  be  studied  by  the %0aglass  painter  and  again  placed  as  the  foundation  of  his  labours  ; %0amodern  chemistry  has,  doubtless,  supplied  him  with  means,  in %0amany  instances  far  beyond  what  his  predecessors  have  enjoyed,  in %0athe  pursuit  of  this  art,  but  there  are  yet  conditions  to  be  fulfilled %0awhich  principally  depend  upon  himself.  The  glass  painter  should %0awell  weigh  the  propriety  of  striving  to  rival  the  grey  demi-tints %0aof  the  oil  painters,  or  aiming  at  the  production  of  effects  to  which %0athe  nature  of  his  art  is  in  opposition  ^  It  was  firom  careful  con- %0asideration and  long  experience  that  the  art  of  glass  painting  be- %0acame digested  into  the  excellence  of  the  15th  and  16th  centuries ; %0aimpotency,  assuredly,  had  no  share  in  principles  followed.  That %0athe  apparent  simplicity  of  the  methods  of  the  Byzantine  and %0aGothic  glass  painters,  the  powerful  and  harmonious  effects  re- %0asulting from  a  skilful  arrangement  and  breadth  of  colour,  to  which %0aTheophilus  directs  the  attention  of  the  artist,  although  allied %0ato  meagre  invention,  poor  drawing,  and  incomplete  execution,  car- %0aried them  triumphantly  through  their  ordeal,  the  remains  of  the %0aworks,  executed  under  the  influence  of  this  school,  attest.

The  experience %0aof  the  past  was  neglected,  and  the  art  gradually  sank,  only  to  be %0arevived  by  a  return  to  the  practice  which  elevated  it.

Roziere,  **  amongst  the  fragments  of  coloured %0a%3c glass  with  which  they  abound,  some  pieces  tinted  with  various %0a%3c colours.  Many  of  them,  affording  in  some  of  their  parts,  beautiful %0a%3c tints  of  purple,  were,  I  think,  remains  of  the  ancient  artificial %0a%3c %3c•  vasa  murrhina  *' — frits,  glasses,  enamels,  are  also  found,  coloured %0a%3c by  metallic  oxides^. %0a%3c %0a%3c The  Phoenicians  having  traded  in  the  glass  of  Thebes,  became %0a%3c themselves  famous  in  the  art  of  its  manufacture.  The  tale  of  the %0a%3c fortuitous  discovery  of  glass  by  them,  related  by  Pliny  ^  and  fre- %0a%3c quently quoted,  is  stated  by  Merret,  upon  the  authority  of  the %0a%3c most  experienced,  to  be  impossible,  as  even  by  the  most  violent %0a%3c fire  glass  cannot  be  made,  in  any  quantity,  by  burning  substances, %0a%3c fit  for  its  composition,  in  the  open  air. %0a%3c %0a%3c '  Eircher,  (Edip.

For,  owing  to  the  presence  of  metallic  oxides  in  the %0a%3c alkaline  carbonate,  or  the  quartsous  fragments,  the  production  of %0a%3c a  coloured  glass  would  be  of  earlier  date  than  a  pure  and  colour- %0a%3c less vitrification.  Theophilus  provides  for  the  casual  colouring %0a%3c of  the  **  metal  "  through  the  mixture  of  metallic  oxides  with  its %0a%3c elements. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The  divers  colours  of  glass  not  transparent,  which  Theophilus %0a%3c tells  us,  c.  xii.,  were  found  in  the  edifices  of  the  Pagans,  in  mosaic %0a%3c work,  were  doubtless  of  the  kind  which  were  seen  in  Egypt  by %0a%3c M.  de  Roziere,  and  the  art  of  making  which  was  transmitted  to %0a%3c the  Greeks.  Pliny  ^  remarks  upon  a  manufacture  imitating  the  ob- %0a%3c sidian stone,  "  Obsidian  stone  is  also  made  in  stained  fashion,  for %0a%3c vessels  of  repast,  and  a  perfectly  red  glass  and  not  Not  Trans- %0a%3c lucent, called  hsematinon.  Whitb  is  also  made  and  Murrhinum %0a%3c (purple),  or  Hyacinth  and  Safphirb,  and  imitation  in  All %0a%3c Other  Colours."  In  the  previous  chapter  Pliny  mentions  that %0a%3c pavements  and  other  ornaments  in  glass  were  used  by  Agrippa  in %0a%3c the  construction  of  his  baths.  This  kind  of  mosaic  work,  then, %0a%3c served  the  Byzantine  artists  in  the  construction  of  the  enamelled %0a%3c vases  which  were  so  beautiful  in  colour  and  are  now  so  rare. %0a%3c These  enamels  are  all  opaque,  and  present  the  appearance  of  the %0a%3c finest  mosaics.  Theophilus  tells  us  that  white,  black,  green^ %0a%3c yellow,  blue,  red  and  purple  glass,  found  also  in  the  form  of %0a%3c utensils,  were  used  for  this  work  by  the  French,  who  were  al- %0a%3c ready "  skilful  in  the  art  "  of  working  glass.  Pliny,  indeed, %0a%3c states  that  Italy,  Gaul,  and  Spain,  pursued  the  manufacture  of %0a%3c glass. %0a%3c %0a%3c This  opaque  glass  was,  doubtless,  the  Vitrum  Rouanum  of %0a%3c Eraclius,  some  of  whose  chapters  are  quoted  by  Theophilus  at  the %0a%3c end  of  the  third  book. %0a%3c %0a%3c '  Plinii,  Nat.

This  last  chapter  indeed  proves  that  the %0a%3c Byzantine  Greeks  practised  the  art  of  Paintiho  upon  Glass,  an %0a%3c art  which  all  the  French  writers,  from  Le  Viel  to  M.  E.  Thibaud, %0a%3c with  perhaps  a  laudable  partiality,  labour  to  prove  of  French %0a%3c origin,  and  of  the  twelfth  or  thirteenth  century. %0a%3c %0a%3c Emeric  David^  indeed,  in  exception,  mentions  that  the  historian %0a%3c of  the  monastery  of  St.  Begnine,  who  wrote  about  1052,  declares %0a%3c that  there  existed,  yet  in  his  timCf  in  the  church  of  the  monastery, %0a%3c a  very  ancient  glass  window,  representing  the  martyrdom  of  St. %0a%3c Paschasie,  and  that  this  painting  had  been  taken  from  the  old %0a%3c church,  restored  by  Charles  the  Bald,  (a.  d.  850,)  **  vr  qujbdah %0a%3c viTREA  ANTiauiTus  FACTA,  et  usquc  ad  nostra  perdurans  tempora, %0a%3c elegant!  praemonstrabat  picturft." %0a%3c %0a%3c The  Benedictines  have  ascribed  this  invention  to  the  period  of %0a%3c Charlemagne,  T.  6,  p.  66,  and  with  more  reason.  For  Theo- %0a%3c philus  not  only  describes  the  ornamenting  of  cups,'  vases,  and %0a%3c other  utensils,  by  means  of  coloured  glass  fluxed  upon  a  white %0a%3c ground ;  but  in  C.  fil  are  found  clear  directions  for  painting  upon %0a%3c glass.  "  In  the  same  manner  you  make  grounds  of  the  clearest %0a%3c white,  the  figures  of  which  grounds  you  ornament  with  sapphire, %0a%3c green,  purple,  and  red."  The  dark  colour  is  to  take  the  place  of %0a%3c pose  in  marking  the  nude,  &c. %0a%3c %0a%3c Traces  of  a  flux  for  the  purpose  of  ornamenting  vases,  whether %0a%3c of  glass  or  earthenware,  are  found  scattered  through  the  books  of %0a%3c Eraclius.

This  art  would  naturally  lead  to  that  of  painting %0a%3c upon  glass,  the  transition  would  likewise  be  immediate.  In  chap. %0a%3c XV.  Theophilus  informs  us  that  the  same  people  made  **  glass %0a%3c tablets,  as  in  window  work/'  which  they  ornamented  with  gold, %0a%3c laying  a  flux  behind  the  leaf  in  order  to  protect  it.  This  was %0a%3c principally  used  in  mosaic  work:  tlie  decoration  of  vases  with %0a%3c g(dd  leaf  and  coloured  ornamental  work,  having  been  applied  to %0a%3c glass,  as  well  as  fictile  vases  and  cups,  became  transferred  to  the %0a%3c glass  plates,  and  thus  were  introduced  into  window-work. %0a%3c %0a%3c Eraclius,  who  is  quoted  by  Theophilus  in  the  third  book,  gives %0a%3c a  chapter  upon  this  subject. %0a%3c %0a%3c It  would  not,  perhaps,  be  uninteresting  to  the  artist  were  I  to %0a%3c give  an  extract  from  a  manuscript  of  Sir  T.

The  French  artists  have  noticed  this %0a%3c effect;  they  also  observe  that  such  a  custom  if  abused  **  fait  trou" %0a%3c in  the  composition. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c C.  XXVIII.    "  CRUCES  IN  CAPITE  MAJESTATIS." %0a%3c %0a%3c At  an  epoch  when  the  painters  and  other  artists,  employed  in %0a%3c the  decoration  o£  sacred  edifices,  were  either  belonging  to,  or %0a%3c under  the  influence  of  the  church,  the  laws  of  religious  icono- %0a%3c graphy were  faithfully  observed;  the  nimbus  or  glory,  by  which  the %0a%3c heads  of  Divine,  or  sainted,  personages  were  surrounded»  was  em- %0a%3c blematical of  the  sacred  character.  M.  Didron,  in  the  "  Icono- %0a%3c graphie  Chretienne,"  informs  us  that  when  a  figure  is  without  the %0a%3c nimbus,  it  may  certainly  be  said  that  it  is  no  representation  of  a %0a%3c saint. %0a%3c %0a%3c A  more  sacred  character  still  was  given  to  the  Divinity,  the %0a%3c Angels  and  Apostles ;  these  were  alone  represented  with  the  feet %0a%3c uncovered.  Neither  the  Virgin  nor  other  saints  were  thus  repre- %0a%3c sented at  this  epoch. %0a%3c %0a%3c Every  figure  with  the  nimbus  is  «a  saint,  every  saint  with  nude %0a%3c feet  is  at  the  least  an  apostle ;  every  figure  with  a  nimbus  orna- %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c NOTES   TO    BOOK   II.  183 %0a%3c %0a%3c mented  with  a  cross  can  be  but  one  of  the  three  Divine  personages : %0a%3c this^  adds  M.  Didron»  is  the  invariable  rule. %0a%3c %0a%3c Until  the  eleventh  century  the  Latin  church,  as  well  as  the  Greek, %0a%3c fraternized  with  the  Jewish  religion.  An  enamelled  cross  of  the %0a%3c Abbey  of  Saint  Bertin,  a  romaic  cross  of  the  eleventh  century, %0a%3c gives  the  nimbus>  the  character  of  saint,  to  Moses,  to  his  brother %0a%3c Aaron,  to  the  prophet  who  marks  the  elect  with  the  "  than,"  to %0a%3c Isaac,  to  Joshua  and  Caleb.  But  at  the  moment  of  the  consum- %0a%3c mation of  the  schism,  this  respect,  which  the  Latin  church  formerly %0a%3c entertained  for  the  personages  of  the  Old  Testament,  sensibly  di- %0a%3c minished ;  the  Byzantine  influence,  alone,  partially  preserved  it, %0a%3c but  in  the  fourteenth  century  the  Christian  saints  only  kept  this %0a%3c attribute.     The  Greeks  continue  the  practice  unto  this  day  ^ %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c C.  XXX.     QUOMODO    REPORMETUR  VAS   VITREUM %0a%3c %0a%3c FRACTUM. %0a%3c %0a%3c This  invention  appears  to  have  been  made  in  the  reign  of %0a%3c Tiberius  Csesar,  and  to  have  led  to  the  fable  of  malleable  glass. %0a%3c Pliny,  who  has  been  quoted  by  St.  Isidore,  mentions  an  invention %0a%3c of  a  composition,  or  tempering,  which  rendered  glass  tender,  and %0a%3c that  Tiberius,  fearing  this  would  depreciate  the  value  of  the %0a%3c precious  metals,  abolished  the  workshop  of  the  artificer.  This %0a%3c story  has  been  wonderfully  improved  by  St.  Isidore,  who  adds  a %0a%3c hammer  to  the  tale,  and  converts  the  "tender"  or  "  tractable  glass " %0a%3c mentioned  by  Pliny  into  one  which  is  "  malleable."  Eraclius %0a%3c quotes  from  St.  Isidore,  rather  than  from  Pliny,  whose  version  is %0a%3c too  plain  to  admit  of  the  marvellous. %0a%3c %0a%3c Pliny  writes,  "  Ferunt,  Tiberio  principe,  excogitatum  vitri  tem- %0a%3c peramentum,  ut  flexibile  esset :  et  totam  officinam  artificis  ejus %0a%3c abolitam,  ne  »ris,  argenti,  auri,  metallis  pretia  detraherentur : %0a%3c eaque  fama  crebrior  diu,  quam  certior  fuit."* %0a%3c %0a%3c St.  Isidore,  disregarding  the  doubt  expressed  by  Pliny,  that %0a%3c glass  could  even  be  rendered  more  tractable,  writes  ^ — "  It  is  re- %0a%3c lated that,  under  Tiberius  Caesar,  an  artificer  invented  a  tempering %0a%3c for  glass,  which  rendered  it  tender  and  ductile  {flexibile  et  ductile^ %0a%3c %0a%3c '  ICsnuel  d'lconognpliie  Chr6tienne,  p.  134. %0a%3c %0a%3c »  Pliny.

The %0a%3c artificer  raised  the  jar  from  the  floor,  thrust  a  small  hammer  into %0a%3c the  cavity,  and  mended  the  jar.  This  done,  Ceesar  asked  the %0a%3c artificer  whether  any  other  person  knew  this  tempering  for  glass» %0a%3c and  when  he  denied,  with  an  oath,  that  any  other  knew  of  it, %0a%3c Caesar  ordered  him  to  be  decapitated ;  lest,  this  known,  gold  and %0a%3c silver  might  become  as  clay,  and  the  value  of  all  metals  be  debased. %0a%3c For,  in  truth,  did  glass  vessels  not  break  they  would  be  better %0a%3c than  gold  or  silver." %0a%3c %0a%3c We  see  that  the  relation  of  Pliny  has  been  much  improved,  and %0a%3c that  Isidore  has  perpetrated,  or  perpetuated,  an  error  which  gave %0a%3c much  trouble  to  many  an  alchemist  of  the  middle  ages. %0a%3c %0a%3c Pliny,  L.  29,  c.  3,  gives  us  the  process  usually  followed  io  his %0a%3c time  for  cementing  broken  glass,  "  candidum  ex  his  (ovis)  admis- %0a%3c tum  calci  vivae  glutinat  vitri  fragmentaj  "  **  white  of  an  egg,  mixed %0a%3c with  quick-lime,  glues  together  the  fragments  of  glass.'* %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c DE  COMPONENDIS  FENESTRIS. %0a%3c %0a%3c Of  the  use  of  coloured  glass  by  the  ancients  it  has  been  shown %0a%3c that  we  have  proof.  The  enamelled  charms,  (abracadedfra^)  and %0a%3c the  "  abaculi  "  of  the  Greeks  and  Romans,  yet  in  existence,  show %0a%3c this.  The  Romans  employed  glass  in  the  embellishment  of  their %0a%3c apartments,  and  Seneca  appears  to  intend  that  mirrors  were  em- %0a%3c ployed for  this  purpose,  as  at  the  present  day.  **  Pauper  sibi  vi- %0a%3c detur  ac  sordid  us,  nisi  parietes  magnis  et  pretiosis  orbibus  refulse- %0a%3c runt,  nisi  vitro  absconditur  camera."

Lactantius '  and %0a%3c St.  Jerome',  writers  of  the  third  and  fourth  centuries,  both  speak %0a%3c of  glazed  windows.  The  employment  of  coloured  glass  arranged %0a%3c in  Mosaic  fashion,  the  "  fenestra  simplex,"  c.  29  of  Theophilus, %0a%3c would  soon  give  place  to  the  use  of  painted  glass  as  the  art  nd- %0a%3c vanced.  Observant  of  the  effects  of  colour  productive  of  such %0a%3c admiration  during  the  early  efforts  of  art,  new  exertions,  in  order %0a%3c to  unite  the  beauty  of  pictorial  effect  with  the  previous  richness  of %0a%3c decoration,  would  doubtless  soon  be  made  to  call  to  aid  the  talents %0a%3c of  the  Christian  artist. %0a%3c %0a%3c In  the  sixth  century,  when  Fortunatus  of  Poitiers  ^  lauds  the %0a%3c bishops  who  ornamented  their  churches  with  large  windows  of %0a%3c glass,  and  the  effect  which  they  produced  by  the  rays  of  the  sun ; %0a%3c he,  by  this,  evidently  intends  a  coloured  glass. %0a%3c %0a%3c Sidonius  Apollinaris^  in  his  letter  to  Hesperius,  speaks  positively %0a%3c of  coloured  glass  having  been  used  in  the  windows  of  the  church %0a%3c erected  by  Patiens,  at  Lyons. %0a%3c %0a%3c **  Ecclesia  nuper  constructa  est  Lugduni,  quae  studio  papae  Pa- %0a%3c tientis  ad  summum  coepti  operis  accessit,  viri  sancti,  strenui,  &c. %0a%3c %0a%3c "  InUu  lux  micat,  atque  bracteatinn %0a%3c Sol  sic  sollicitatur  ad  lacunar, %0a%3c Folvo  nt  concolor  erret  in  metallo, %0a%3c Dirtinctum  vario  nitore  marmor %0a%3c Fercuirit  camerain,  solum,  feneatiasw %0a%3c Ac  tub  Tenicoloribus  figuria %0a%3c Yemans  herbida  cructa  saphiratoB %0a%3c Flectit  per  prasinum  vitrum  lapilloa." %0a%3c %0a%3c Fortunatus  and  Paul  the  hermit,  as  well  as  Theophilus,  de- %0a%3c scribe the  admirable  effect  which  the  rising  sun  produced  through %0a%3c the  windows  of  St.  Sophia  at  Constantinople.  (See  Preface  to  this %0a%3c Book,  p.  117.) %0a%3c %0a%3c It  is  more  than  probable  that  all  these  early  ornamental  windows %0a%3c were  in  the  Mosaic  style  of  art,  and  that  the  various  glass  was %0a%3c coloured  by  the  combination  of  the  metallic  oxides  with  the  glass %0a%3c %0a%3c *  De  opiiicio  Dei.  *~St  Jerome.

In  c.  Ift  and  13,  Theo- %0a%3c philus  does  not  neglect  the  mention  of  this  process^  whereby  he %0a%3c tells  us  that  *'  the  Frsnch  made  costly  plates  of  sapphire,  purple %0a%3c and  green,  very  useful  in  windows,"  and  in  c.  IS,  he  informs  us %0a%3c that  the  **vitrum  clarissimum,"  used  as  a  flux,  was  composed  by  the %0a%3c Greeks.  Theophilus,  who  asserts  that  he  has  ''  embraced  the  na- %0a%3c ture of  glass,"  subsequent  to  his  visit  to  St.  Sophia,  and  his  admir- %0a%3c ation of  the  effect  produced  by  the  different  hues  thrown  upon %0a%3c the  chancel,  is  the  first  practical  author  who  enters  minutely  into  a %0a%3c description  of  the  processes  of  the  glass  painter,  and,  as  a  prac- %0a%3c tical artist,  is  the  more  worthy  of  our  serious  attention.  The %0a%3c art  of  enamelling  glass  yras  then  known  to  the  Bysantine  Greeks ; %0a%3c the  sutement  of  the  historian  of  the  monastery  of  St.  Begnine  is, %0a%3c therefore,  most  credible,  although  attacked  by  the  later  French %0a%3c writers  in  order  to  support  their  pretensions,  and  the  opinion  of %0a%3c the  Benedictines,  that  pictorial  representation  upon  glass  dates %0a%3c from  the  period  of  Charlemagne,  is  supported.  The  art  of  pro- %0a%3c ducing a  picture  by  means  of  gradation  of  shadow,  thereby  forming %0a%3c combinations  of  light,  shade,  and  colour  with  the  plate  of  stained  or %0a%3c enamelled  glass  subjected  to  this  process,  was  the  first  and  great %0a%3c step  taken  in  the  art  of  glass  painting.  It  is  the  process  of  Theo- %0a%3c philus, who,  however,  appears  to  have  entertained  the  idea  of  paint- %0a%3c ing objects  upon  glass  with  coloured  fluxes,  in  imitation  of  the %0a%3c ornaments  upon  vases  and  cups. %0a%3c %0a%3c That  this  process  was  more  congenial  to  the  production  of  ex- %0a%3c cellence in  window  work  than  any  other,  the  remains  of  church %0a%3c windows,  executed  from  the  beginning  of  the  eleventh  to  the  end  of %0a%3c the  fifteenth  century,  are  in  evidence  to  attest. %0a%3c %0a%3c Reasons  for  this  are  not  wanting ;  they  have  lately  been  brought %0a%3c forward  with  great  happiness  by  the  later  writers  upon  the  art,  and %0a%3c who  attempt  to  prove  that  in  order  to  return  to  the  excellence %0a%3c shown  at  the  periods  above  referred  to,  the  same  simplicity  of %0a%3c shadows  and  breadth  and  purity  of  colour  must  be  returned  to. %0a%3c %0a%3c The  care  of  the  painters  of  these  later  periods  in  the  taste  and %0a%3c purity  of  outline  is  another  cause  of  the  excellence  of  their  works- %0a%3c Outline  and  arrangement  of  colour  were  the  points  to  which  all %0a%3c other  considerations  properly  yielded,  in  this  mode  of  decoration, %0a%3c viewed  by  the  means  of  transmitted  light  alone;  which  trans- %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c NOTES   TO    BOOK  II.  187 %0a%3c %0a%3c mission,  while  it  was  found  to  blend  and  harmonise  the  rays  of %0a%3c coloured  light  before  they  reached  the  observer,  rendered  nugatory, %0a%3c or  poor,  the  greys  ^  introduced  by  yet  later  artists  in  order  to %0a%3c blend  their  colour  with  shadow,  or  lights  as  practised  in  pictures %0a%3c seen  by  the  means  of  reflected  light. %0a%3c %0a%3c The  fact,  as  related  by  Bede,  the  Saxon  chronicler,  of  the  im- %0a%3c portation from  France  and  Italy,  into  our  own  country,  of  arti- %0a%3c ficers in  glass,  (a.d.  674,)  by  Wilfrid,  Bishop  of  York,  and  Biscop %0a%3c his  friend,  had  an  important  influence  upon  this  branch  of  art  in %0a%3c England.  **  When  the  work  {of  St.  Peter's)  was  far  advanced," %0a%3c writes  Bede,  *'  he  sent  agents  to  France  to  procure,  if  possible, %0a%3c some  glass  makers,  a  kind  of  artificers  quite  unknown  in  England, %0a%3c and  to  bring  them  over  to  glaze  the  windows  of  his  church  and %0a%3c monastery.  These  agents  were  successful,  and  brought  several %0a%3c glass  makers  with  them,  who  not  only  performed  the  work  re- %0a%3c quired by  Benedict  Biscop,  but  instructed  the  English  in  the  art %0a%3c of  making  glass  for  windows,  lamps,  drinking  vessels,"  &c. — %0a%3c Bede,  Hist.  Abbot.  Weremuthen. %0a%3c %0a%3c Emeric  David  states  that  the  English,  in  their  turn,  instructed %0a%3c the  Germans  in  this  art. %0a%3c %0a%3c While  the  influence  of  the  style  of  the  preceding  ages  was  sens- %0a%3c ibly felt  during  the  14th  century,  the  remarkable  progress  in  the %0a%3c arts  of  painting  and  design  before  the  close  of  that  era  greatly  af- %0a%3c fected this  art,  while  at  the  same  time  the  route  previously  fol- %0a%3c lowed was  not  much  deviated  from.  The  Florentine  and.  other %0a%3c schoc^s  of  art  had  arisen  in  Italy. %0a%3c %0a%3c Still  the  coloured  and  ornamented  grounds  prevailed,  the  painted %0a%3c windows  in  the  cathedrals  of  Bourges,  Clermont,  Chartres,  &c., %0a%3c show  that  the  circles,  flourishes,  and  other  ornaments  of  the  11  th %0a%3c century,  described  by  Theophilus,  yet  held  their  places,  but  the %0a%3c subjects  were  better  portrayed;  to  the  experience  of  the  past  wa» %0a%3c added  the  new-born  genius  of  Italy,  and  the  art  which  the  Bysan- %0a%3c tine  Greeks  had  transmitted  to  Western  Europe  approached  the %0a%3c summit  of  excellence. %0a%3c %0a%3c I  am  not  aware  that  the  history  o£  the  processes  of  this  period %0a%3c have  been  at  all  inquired  into;  in  the  little  space  afforded,  in  a %0a%3c work  of  this  nature,  I  have  endeavoured  to  collect  a  few  practical %0a%3c directions  from  the  manuscripts  of  the  period.

The  commerce  they  monopoliied %0a%3c in  white  and  coloured  glass  became  an  important  feature  in  their %0a%3c statistics ;  this  branch  o£  industry  and  art  might,  with  the  com- %0a%3c mand we  possess  of  material  and  facilities,  be  developed  to  a  great %0a%3c extent  in  this  country. %0a%3c %0a%3c There  are  many  processes  here  described  which  will  repay  the %0a%3c trouble  of  perusal  to  the  most  scientific  of  our  artists ;  those, %0a%3c however,  are  not  of  the  class  which  would  turn  from  any  inquiry %0a%3c upon  the  subject  during  the  present  state  of  conflicting  opinions, %0a%3c when  the  very  principles  of  the  art  which  formerly  led  to  its  per- %0a%3c fection are  questioned,  or  neglected. %0a%3c %0a%3c The  principles  laid  down  by  Theophilus  must  be  studied  by  the %0a%3c glass  painter  and  again  placed  as  the  foundation  of  his  labours  ; %0a%3c modern  chemistry  has,  doubtless,  supplied  him  with  means,  in %0a%3c many  instances  far  beyond  what  his  predecessors  have  enjoyed,  in %0a%3c the  pursuit  of  this  art,  but  there  are  yet  conditions  to  be  fulfilled %0a%3c which  principally  depend  upon  himself.  The  glass  painter  should %0a%3c well  weigh  the  propriety  of  striving  to  rival  the  grey  demi-tints %0a%3c of  the  oil  painters,  or  aiming  at  the  production  of  effects  to  which %0a%3c the  nature  of  his  art  is  in  opposition  ^  It  was  firom  careful  con- %0a%3c sideration and  long  experience  that  the  art  of  glass  painting  be- %0a%3c came digested  into  the  excellence  of  the  15th  and  16th  centuries ; %0a%3c impotency,  assuredly,  had  no  share  in  principles  followed.  That %0a%3c the  apparent  simplicity  of  the  methods  of  the  Byzantine  and %0a%3c Gothic  glass  painters,  the  powerful  and  harmonious  effects  re- %0a%3c sulting from  a  skilful  arrangement  and  breadth  of  colour,  to  which %0a%3c Theophilus  directs  the  attention  of  the  artist,  although  allied %0a%3c to  meagre  invention,  poor  drawing,  and  incomplete  execution,  car- %0a%3c ried them  triumphantly  through  their  ordeal,  the  remains  of  the %0a%3c works,  executed  under  the  influence  of  this  school,  attest.

The  experience %0a%3c of  the  past  was  neglected,  and  the  art  gradually  sank,  only  to  be %0a%3c revived  by  a  return  to  the  practice  which  elevated  it. %0a\ No newline at end of file%0a
