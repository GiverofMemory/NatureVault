csum= Nettle leaf powder is one of the best human and animal dewormers (and unlike most deworming herbs it doesn't stress the liver!) and can be added to human food or animal feed up to about 1%25 by weight.  Seems to also help the body fight worms outside the digestive tract (one of faucis bioweapons is strongyloides which disseminates throughout the body translocating dangerous bacteria) probably by improving CD4/CD8 ratio and balancing Th1/Th2 ratio.  Contains lots of vitamin A for good yolk color, vitamin K for proper blood clotting, silica, selenium, pretty much the perfect supplement.
