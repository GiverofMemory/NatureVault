text=Flower Buds %0a%0a%0a%0a4. In the Beginning, Rabbi Shimon opened, "The flower buds have appeared %0aon the earth" (In Hebrew the words "land" and "earth" are designated by the %0asame word, Eretz', Song of Songs, 2:12). "The flower buds" refer to the act of %0acreation; "appeared on the earth." When? On the third day, as it is said, "And %0athe earth brought forth grass" (Beresheet, 1:12). "The time of singing has %0acome" refers to the fourth day, the time of strictness, judgment, restriction. %0aTherefore, on the fourth day, the word "lights" is written with a missing letter, %0awhich hints at the strictness of judgment and a curse. "And the voice of the %0aturtle dove is heard" refers to the fifth day, on which it is said, "Let the waters %0aswarm," so that they can produce offspring. However, the words "is heard" %0aalready refer to the sixth day, on which it is said, "Let us make man," who, %0ain the future, shall put action before understanding (we shall do and we shall %0ahear, Naaseh ve Nishmah). For here it is said, "Let us make man," and there %0ait is said, "We shall do and we shall hear." "In our land" refers to the day of %0aShabbat, which is like the Land of Life, the world to come. %0a%0aIt is completely incomprehensible to us how The Zohar compares the words %0afrom Shir HaShirim (Song of Songs, 2:12) with what is written in the Torah about %0athe first days of creation. The six days of creation symbolize the six Sefirot HGT %0aNHY of ZA, onto which all ten Sefirot of Nukva are built. This is because Nukva %0ais only the will to receive (pleasure), while her entire spiritual body (desires of %0abestowal) consists of her husband's Sefirot, ZA, the altruistic properties that ZA %0apasses to Nukva. %0a%0aNukva herself (the created desire to receive pleasure) is an empty place %0aunfilled with Light (the Creator). This is because the Light can only enter a %0adesire (Klz) with similar properties to itself. Therefore, to the extent of her %0asimilarity to ZA, the properties that Malchut receives from ZA, those corrected %0aproperties of Malchut turn into a Partzuf and become filled with the Light that %0acorresponds to their correction. %0a%0a%0a%0a63 %0a%0a%0a%0a64 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aThus, the greater the correction that is made in a particular part, the greater %0athe Light (of the five Lights NRNHY) that enters that part. The corrected and %0afulfilled part of Malchut is referred to as a "world." Here and henceforth, The %0aZohar explains how ~Nukva is built out of ZA, i.e., how the world is created. %0a%0aNukva is called "earth." Flower buds are Sefirot— the properties of ZA %0athat appear and grow within Malchut on the third day of creation, which %0acorresponds to Sefira Tifferet (Hesed-l, Gevura-2, Tifferet-3). In the beginning, %0aMalchut was created as ZA in height; two equally great celestial bodies, the %0aSun— ZA and the Moon— Malchut. This is why we see them as being equal in %0asize when the Moon is full. After all, all that is said with regard to man. In the %0ainitial state following her creation, Malchut is a point at the feet of ZA, and %0asubsequently grows along him. %0a%0aThat is to say, on the third day of creation, Malchut was equal in height %0a(had the same properties) to Tifferet of ZA. However, Malchut was not able to %0areceive the Light in such a state. Hence, it is said, STRICTNESS (judgment) %0aAPPEARED ON THE EARTH (in Malchut); the flower buds merely appeared. %0a%0aAnd after that, THE TIME OF SINGING HAS COME already refers to the %0afourth day of creation, when Malchut was diminished, because she complained %0ato the Creator: "Two angels cannot wear one crown"— if Malchut is equal to ZA %0ain height, she cannot receive the Light of Hochma from him. %0a%0aThe reason for that being— not having received the Light of Hassadim from %0aZA beforehand, Malchut cannot receive the Light of Hochma, as the Light of %0aHochma can only be received within the Light of Hassadim, by clothing the Light %0aof Hochma (pleasure) into the Light of Hassadim (the intention to enjoy "for the %0aCreator's sake"). %0a%0aAnd the Creator answered Malchut: "Go and diminish yourself." In other %0awords: if, owing to your egoistic properties, you cannot receive the Light %0aindependently, but only from ZA, then diminish your own properties, accept %0aHis, and gradually correct yourself. Then you will be able to receive all of the %0aLight and be like Him (ZA— the Creator). All of this is described in the Talmud %0a(Hullin, 60:2), but only with the explanation provided in The Zohar do we stop %0aperceiving it as a fairytale. %0a%0aThen Malchut descended below Yesod of ZA, and her nine lower Sefirot %0afell below Parsa into the worlds of BYA. And only her Sefira Keter remained %0ain Atzilut as a point standing below Yesod of ZA. And from here on, Malchut %0ais built not of her own Sefirot (properties) that exist in BYA, but of Sefirot %0a(properties) Net^ah and Hod of ZA. %0a%0a%0a%0aFlower Buds %0a%0a%0a%0a65 %0a%0a%0a%0aAlthough Malchut was previously bigger, she was not able to receive the %0aLight for lack of the Light of Hassadim; now she will be smaller, but she will %0ahave the Light of Hassadim, in which she will be able to receive the Light of %0aHochma. Even though Malchut will be at a lower degree, she will be able to utilize %0ait, for the Light of Hassadim repels the impure forces that cling to Nulcva. That %0ais the meaning of the word Zamir (singing/ pruning). However, there is another %0ameaning to this word that is at use here— cutting off, or pruning the impure %0aforces from Malchut (rose bud). %0a%0aTHE VOICE OF THE TURTLE DOVE: The turtle dove is a Sefira, the %0aproperty of Net^ah de ZA, and the voice of the turtle dove represents Sefira Hod %0aof ZA, the fifth day of creation. And since Malchut receives from Yesod (which %0areceives from Hod that is joined with Netjah), such reception by Malchut is %0areferred to as "the voice of the turtle dove." %0a%0aTherefore, the words "is heard" refer to the sixth day, since the voice of the %0aturtle dove (Malchut) is heard only with the help of the sixth day, Yesod of ZA, %0awhich includes both Net^ah and Hod, and passes their Light to Malchut. Hence, %0ait is said that this voice is heard in Malchut only from Yesod, on the sixth day. %0a%0aThe reason for this is that Malchut can receive the Light only from the %0amiddle line of ZA: either from Yesod of ZA (she receives the degree called NHY, %0aIhur - embryo) or from Tifferet of ZA (she receives the degree called HGT = VAK, %0aYenilca - nursing or Katnut - smallness) or from Daat of ZA (she receives the %0adegree called HBD = GAR, Mochin - brain or Gadlut - big). %0a%0a%0a%0aLeft %0a1 %0a%0a%0aLINES %0a%0aMiddle %0a%0a_L_ %0a%0a%0aRight %0a1 %0a%0a%0aNAME %0aOF DEGREE %0a%0a%0aTHE LIGHT %0aIN THE DEGREE %0a%0a%0a( Bina %0aM %0a%0ai %0a%0a%0a)M %0aDaat %0a%0a%0aHochma) %0a1 %0a%0ai %0a%0a%0aHBD {HaBaD) %0a%0a%0aThe Light of Neshama %0a= The light of HBD %0a%0a%0a( Gevura %0a%0ai %0a%0a%0a! , %0a%0aTifferet %0a%0a%0aHesed J %0a%0a%0aHGT [HaGaT) %0a%0a%0aThe Light of Ruach %0a= The light of HGT %0a%0a%0af Hod %0a%0a%0aH-( %0a%0aYesod %0a%0a%0aNetzah J %0aj %0a%0a%0aNHY {NeHY) %0a%0a%0aThe Light of Nefesh %0a= The light of NHY %0a%0a%0a%0a66 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aLET US MAKE MAN, FOR IN THE FUTURE HE SHALL PUT ACTION %0aBEFORE LISTENING: sight refers to Sefira Hochma, hearing refers to Sefira %0aBina. Action or deed is a property of Malchut. In order to correct Malchut, the %0aCreator's only creation (other Sefirot are properties of the Creator Himself, with %0awhich He gradually created Malchut), a second restriction was made— Malchut %0aascended to Bina so as to combine her egoistic properties of reception with %0aBina's altruistic properties of bestowal; Malchut ascended to Aba-Hochma, and %0aIma-Bina found herself below Malchut (Parsa), where she became similar in her %0aproperties to Malchut. %0a%0aEyes refer to Sefira Hochma or Aba. Malchut ascended to the level of eyes and %0astands at the level of pupils. Malchut is called Nukva; and Malchut that stands %0aat the level of eyes is called Nikvey Eynaim (pupils) or NE. That is why there are %0aonly Keter and Hochma in the Rosh (head) of AA: Bina fell from the Rosh to the %0aGuf (body) and Malchut is above Bina, that is, Malchut represents an action that %0ais Above, i.e., precedes perception and understanding. This is what is meant %0aby "we will do, and we will hear"— the act of the second restriction, limiting %0areception only to GE. Such a state is called the "return" (in one's properties to %0athe Creator). The "complete return" occurs when AHP of Malchut gets corrected %0aand joins GE at this degree. %0a%0aAs a result of Malchut's ascent to NE, she changes her properties (every one %0aof us needs only this— to ascend to the level of the Creator's properties, so that %0awe can receive them and become like Him), and is now ready to ascend to AVI %0aand receive the Light of Haya. The constant Light of this level is called the First %0aTemple. That is why when receiving the Torah, Israel elected to act first and hear %0aafter. And for this reason they merited reception of the Torah (Talmud, Shabbat, %0a85:1), as the action (Malchut) ascended and clothed AVI, and thus the secret of %0athe fifty gates of Bina was revealed. %0a%0aConstruction of the Temple does not pertain to it being built in this world, %0abut rather to the attainment of the degree of the Temple, the degree of AVI %0ade Atzilut, the Light of Haya (the First Temple) or the degree of YESH %0aAtzilut, the Light of Neshama (the Second Temple). %0a%0aHere The Zohar tells us: "it is heard" on the sixth day, for on this day (in this %0astate) Malchut was corrected by means of her ascent above Bina, referred to as %0a"placing action before listening," to do and to hear as during the reception of %0athe Torah. Malchut in the state of ascension to Bina is called the Eternal Land or %0athe Land of Life, for she inherits life from Bina. %0a%0a%0a%0aFlower Buds %0a%0a%0a%0a67 %0a%0a%0a%0a"IN OUR LAND" REFERS TO SHABBAT, WHICH IS LIKE THE %0aETERNAL LAND OF LIFE: Ima-Bina is called the Land of Life or the Eternal %0aLand. As a result of the act on the sixth day, meaning the Creator's action from %0aAbove (the factor of time is designated by an action of the Creator Himself, %0awhich has no causes in our world), Malchut ascended to Ima on the seventh day %0aof creation (Shabbat) and became like Ima, for when the lower one ascends to %0athe degree of the Upper One, they become equal (in properties). Hence, upon %0aascending to Bina and there receiving the Light of Haya, Malchut is called the %0aLand of Eternal Life. %0a%0a5. Another explanation: flower buds are the Patriarchs, who entered the mind %0aand entered into the world to come, Bina, where they remain concealed. %0aFrom there they emerge in concealment and conceal themselves in the true %0aprophets. Yosef was born and they concealed themselves within him. When %0aYosef entered the Holy Land, he erected them there, and then "they appeared %0aon the earth" and were revealed there. When did they appear? When a rainbow %0acan be seen, they become revealed. At that moment, "the time of singing has %0acome," meaning the time to eradicate all the wicked in the world. Why did %0athey survive? Because the flower buds have appeared on (from) the earth. And %0aif they were to be seen beforehand, they could not have remained in the %0aworld, and the world would not have been able to exist. %0a%0a%0a%0a%0a68 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aHere The Zohar explains the attainment of the Light of Haya by ZA. NHY of %0aZA are called "sons" and HGT of ZA are called "patriarchs," as well as the "turtle %0adove." ZA himself (seemingly) consists of two parts: above his Chazeh, his Sefirot %0aHGT are called the big ZON; below his Chazeh, Sefirot NHY are called the small %0aZON. Sefirot HGT correspond to Avraham, Yitzchak and Yaakov, while NHY %0acorrespond to Moshe, Aaron and Yosef. Malchut corresponds to King David. %0a%0aSefirot NHY are called "prophets," and Yesod is called "the righteous one." %0aHere The Zohar speaks of the buds that gradually grow from the small state %0ato the big state of ZON: first ZON were small, consisting of Sefirot NHY with %0athe Light of Ne/esh and called Uhar (embryo). Then, with the help of Yenika %0a(nursing), i.e., receiving Light from Ima, ZON grew. Accordingly, the properties %0aof Sefirot NHY grew to equalize those of Sefirot HGT, and Sefirot NHY received %0athe Light of Ruach. %0a%0aThus, the Partzuf now consists of parts of HGT and NHY with the Lights %0aRuach and Ne/esh. Subsequently, by further reception of strength from the Upper %0aOne, and further growth, they've attained the state of Gadlut Aleph, the first big %0astate. Accordingly, Sefirot HGT became HBD with the Light of Neshama, Sefirot %0aNHY became Sefirot HGT, and received new Sefirot NHY. %0a%0aThus, the Partzuf grew to include three parts: HBD, HGT, and NHY with the %0aLights Ne/esh, Ruach, and Nesharna. And it is called Gadol (big— the first big state). %0aThen, through further growth, they've attainted the state of maturity (Gadlut %0aBet, the second big state), and the Light of Haya entered Sefirot HBD. %0a%0a%0a%0a%0a1. Embryo 2. Small 3. Big %0a%0a%0a%0aFlower Buds %0a%0a%0a%0a69 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe word "growth" refers to the growth of a screen, of man's inner anti- %0aegoistic forces and desires. This is the only difference between a big vessel and %0aa small one, the only difference between the Partzufim. Their inner properties %0achange depending on the change in the magnitude of the screen. %0a%0aTHESE FATHERS ENTERED THE SUPERNAL MIND AND %0aASCENDED INTO THE WORLD TO COME: this sentence speaks of the %0aprenatal development of ZA, when he ascends to AVI (called "Supernal Mind" %0aor "Supernal Thought"). Aba-Hochma is called "mind" or "thought," and lma- %0aBina is called "the world to come." And together they are called "parents"— father %0aand mother, AVI. It is there that creation begins— conception of ZA in the initial %0astate of a spiritual embryo. %0a%0a%0a%0aler, so can every man become a spiritual embryo; if he completely relinqui %0aall of his desires and actions, and submits entirely to the will of the Upper %0aPartzuf, he will turn himself into a spiritual embryo, just like a physiological %0aone. The difference between a physiological embryo and a spiritual one lies %0ain the fact that becoming a spiritual embryo requires tremendous personal %0asire and effort, whereas the conception of a physiological embryo deper %0arents. %0a%0a%0a%0a%0apends %0a%0a%0a%0aAs a result of its prenatal development within Bina (which means that one %0acompletely extinguishes all of his personal desires and thoughts, and, like an %0aembryo, is ready to accept all that the mother gives: all of her thoughts and %0aproperties, regardless of how incomprehensible or unnatural they may seem to %0ahis essence), this embryo achieves the state of its spiritual birth. %0a%0aHowever, this is a state of an even greater concealment of the Upper Light %0awith regard to the embryo, for it does not yet have a screen for the reception of %0athis Light. Hence, this state is called Katnut, CONCEALED IN THE TRUE %0aPROPHETS, i.e., in Sefirot Netzah and Hod, which ZA attains as a result of %0athe process of nursing, reception of milk, the Light of Hassadim from Ima %0a(mother) Bina. %0a%0aThe Light of nursing comes to the NHY of ZA, and ZA attains VAK (Light %0aof Nefesh-Ruach), the state of Katnut. During nursing, ZA attains the Sefira %0aYesod, which is why it is said that Yosef is born. After the nursing period is over, %0aZA ascends to AVI so as to receive from them the Light of Neshama, and this %0aconstitutes the state of Gadlut, called "Yosef." %0a%0a%0a%0a70 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aZA consists of three parts: HBD, HGT, and NHY. The process of Zeir Anpin's %0agrowth, of acquiring a screen on his desires, begins with the purest, least egoistic %0apart— Sefirot HBD, in which he first receives the Light of Nefesh. %0a%0aAfterwards, ZA acquires a screen on coarser egoistic desires— Sefirot HGT; %0athe Light of Nefesh passes from HBD to HGT, and the Light of Ruach enters the %0aempty HBD. %0a%0aFinally, ZA acquires a screen on the most egoistic Kelim— Sefirot NHY; the %0aLight of Ne/esh passes from HGT to NHY, the Light of Ruach moves from HBD %0ato the empty HGT, and the Light of Neshama enters the empty HBD. %0a%0aThe attainment of the big state by ZA is called the birth of Yosef, for there %0aemerge Sefirot NHY, of which the last Sefira, Yesod, is called "Yosef." However, %0asince the Light of Haya is not yet present, this state is called "concealment." %0aWHEN YOSEF ENTERED THE HOLY LAND AND ERECTED THEM %0aTHERE: that is, after the attainment of the first big state, the reception of the %0aLight of Neshama, ZA continues to grow, cultivating his screen until the Light %0aof Haya enters it. %0a%0aIn such a state, Malchut of ZA separates from him into an independent %0aPartzuf, called THE HOLY LAND, as the Light of Haya is called holiness. It %0ais therefore said that Yosef entered or, rather, ASCENDED TO THE HOLY %0aLAND in the Gadlut state of ZA. ZA and ~Nukva became equally big in the state %0aof PBP (Panim be Panim, face to face), which is the state that determines the Zivug %0abetween ZON. %0a%0aAND YOSEF ERECTED THEM THERE: the Light of Haya or Hochma %0afills the Partzuf only during a Zivug, when ZON (ZA and Nukva) make a Zivug %0atogether. And this Light remains in Malchut, for only she (her screen) can %0areveal it. Just as AVI are GAR de Bina, YESHSLT is ZAT de Bina and the Light %0aof Hochma is found only in YESHSLT, the relationship between Malchut and %0aZA works along the same principle, and the Light of Hochma is revealed only %0ain Malchut. Therefore, only when the Light of Hochma fills Nu/cva can it be %0asaid that the Light has been revealed, and until that happens, it is considered %0ato be concealed. %0a%0aWHEN ARE THEY SEEN? WHEN A RAINBOW CAN BE SEEN IN %0aTHE WORLD: ZA is called a "rainbow," the world is Malchut, and their union %0ais called a "rainbow within a cloud." THE TIME HAS COME TO ERADICATE %0aALL THE WICKED FROM THE WORLD-as the number of the wicked grows, %0aas more impure forces cling to ZON. The impure forces can influence ZON so %0agreatly that the entire world will be brought to ruin, as has happened in the %0a%0a%0a%0aFlower Buds %0a%0a%0a%0a71 %0a%0a%0a%0atime of the Flood. If so, there is no salvation for man other than through the %0arevelation of the Upper Light, the Light of Haya. That is why The Zohar tells us %0athat the world is saved by the flower buds appearing from the earth, meaning %0athat the Light of Haya eradicates man's impure forces from the earth (his desires, %0aMalchut), and they cannot cling to her and hinder man. %0a%0aAND HAD THEY NOT APPEARED, THERE WOULD BE NO %0aSALVATION FOR THE WORLD-for initially Nuba is built as big as ZA. %0aThis is called the "two great celestial bodies," when Malchut is on the same %0adegree as ZA, but stands behind him, back to back, unable to receive the %0aLight of Hochma in the absence of the Light of Hassadim. This is why Malchut %0acomplains about lacking the Light of Hassadim and thus not being able to %0areceive the Light of Hochma. %0a%0aEven though the moon grows as big as the Sun, it cannot shine independently, %0abut only if the Sun (ZA) gives it Light. And since Malchut lacks the Light of %0aHochma, such a state is called reversed (Achor-back). And a Zivug cannot take %0aplace in the position of back-to-back (Achor he Achor). %0a%0aHowever, after Nukva is born and grows (receives the properties) from the %0aGuf of ZA, as it is written in the Torah (Beresheet 2) that Chava (Eve) was born %0afrom the body of Adam, she becomes equal to ZA and enters into a Zivug face- %0ato-face (Panim he Panim, PBP) with him. %0a%0aAlso, Nukva still retained the previous Light. Moreover, precisely because %0ashe felt the lack of the Light in her initial state, Malchut received the Light of %0aHaya specifically into her previous sufferings. Similarly, man can feel pleasure %0aonly and precisely because of his previous suffering. %0a%0aTherefore, The Zohar tells us that had the flower buds not appeared in %0aMalchut during her Katnut, when she was standing behind ZA, she would not %0ahave been able to receive the Light of Haya in her state of Gadlut, as she would %0anot have the Kelim (desires) to receive this Light. Every new creation is founded %0aon the sensation of darkness, as it is said: the Creator emanates the Light out of %0aHimself, and creates darkness out of nothingness. Man's sensation of darkness %0asignifies his readiness to receive the Light. %0a%0a6. Who sustains the world and evokes the revelation of the Patriarchs? It is the %0avoice of the children engaged in the Torah. The world exists thanks to these %0achildren. Hence, it is said: "We will make for you pendants of gold" (Shir %0aHaShirim, 1:11). These are the children, youngsters of the world, as it is said: %0a"Make two cherubs of gold" (Shemot, 25:18). %0a%0a%0a%0a72 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Light of Ruach is called "the children of the world," and the Zivug in this %0astate (PBA-face to back) is referred to as THE VOICE OF THE CHILDREN %0aENGAGED IN THE TORAH. And it is also called "threads of gold" and %0a"two cherubs of gold." Before Nukva grew, the impure forces had the power to %0adestroy the world. However, precisely because Nukva grows from ZA, the right %0aand left lines merge in her as one, the RAINBOW (right line) shines WITHIN %0aA CLOUD (left line), and the Light of Haya can enter Malchut. Without this %0aLight, the world can be destroyed as during (in the state of) the Flood. %0a%0aSO WHO IS IT THAT SUSTAINS THE WORLD: who causes the %0aappearance of the Light of Hayal They are precisely the children engaged in %0athe Torah. The "children" designate the Light of the opposite side, the Light %0aof Ruach, the sensation of deficiency of the Light of Haya, for a "child" alludes %0ato the process of nursing. The children of the house of Raban (Tinokot Shel Beit %0aRaban)— are the Light of Haya, as the word "Raban" derives from "Rat/" (big, %0aHaya). They did not transgress, i.e., did not use their AHP (egoistic and yet %0auncorrected desires, for the word "children" designates the small state), their %0awill to receive.

In the Beginning, Rabbi Shimon opened, "The flower buds have appeared %0a%3c on the earth" (In Hebrew the words "land" and "earth" are designated by the %0a%3c same word, Eretz', Song of Songs, 2:12). "The flower buds" refer to the act of %0a%3c creation; "appeared on the earth." When? On the third day, as it is said, "And %0a%3c the earth brought forth grass" (Beresheet, 1:12). "The time of singing has %0a%3c come" refers to the fourth day, the time of strictness, judgment, restriction. %0a%3c Therefore, on the fourth day, the word "lights" is written with a missing letter, %0a%3c which hints at the strictness of judgment and a curse. "And the voice of the %0a%3c turtle dove is heard" refers to the fifth day, on which it is said, "Let the waters %0a%3c swarm," so that they can produce offspring. However, the words "is heard" %0a%3c already refer to the sixth day, on which it is said, "Let us make man," who, %0a%3c in the future, shall put action before understanding (we shall do and we shall %0a%3c hear, Naaseh ve Nishmah). For here it is said, "Let us make man," and there %0a%3c it is said, "We shall do and we shall hear." "In our land" refers to the day of %0a%3c Shabbat, which is like the Land of Life, the world to come. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is completely incomprehensible to us how The Zohar compares the words %0a%3c from Shir HaShirim (Song of Songs, 2:12) with what is written in the Torah about %0a%3c the first days of creation. The six days of creation symbolize the six Sefirot HGT %0a%3c NHY of ZA, onto which all ten Sefirot of Nukva are built. This is because Nukva %0a%3c is only the will to receive (pleasure), while her entire spiritual body (desires of %0a%3c bestowal) consists of her husband's Sefirot, ZA, the altruistic properties that ZA %0a%3c passes to Nukva. %0a%3c %0a%3c Nukva herself (the created desire to receive pleasure) is an empty place %0a%3c unfilled with Light (the Creator). This is because the Light can only enter a %0a%3c desire (Klz) with similar properties to itself. Therefore, to the extent of her %0a%3c similarity to ZA, the properties that Malchut receives from ZA, those corrected %0a%3c properties of Malchut turn into a Partzuf and become filled with the Light that %0a%3c corresponds to their correction. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 63 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 64 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Thus, the greater the correction that is made in a particular part, the greater %0a%3c the Light (of the five Lights NRNHY) that enters that part. The corrected and %0a%3c fulfilled part of Malchut is referred to as a "world." Here and henceforth, The %0a%3c Zohar explains how ~Nukva is built out of ZA, i.e., how the world is created. %0a%3c %0a%3c Nukva is called "earth." Flower buds are Sefirot— the properties of ZA %0a%3c that appear and grow within Malchut on the third day of creation, which %0a%3c corresponds to Sefira Tifferet (Hesed-l, Gevura-2, Tifferet-3). In the beginning, %0a%3c Malchut was created as ZA in height; two equally great celestial bodies, the %0a%3c Sun— ZA and the Moon— Malchut. This is why we see them as being equal in %0a%3c size when the Moon is full. After all, all that is said with regard to man. In the %0a%3c initial state following her creation, Malchut is a point at the feet of ZA, and %0a%3c subsequently grows along him. %0a%3c %0a%3c That is to say, on the third day of creation, Malchut was equal in height %0a%3c (had the same properties) to Tifferet of ZA. However, Malchut was not able to %0a%3c receive the Light in such a state. Hence, it is said, STRICTNESS (judgment) %0a%3c APPEARED ON THE EARTH (in Malchut); the flower buds merely appeared. %0a%3c %0a%3c And after that, THE TIME OF SINGING HAS COME already refers to the %0a%3c fourth day of creation, when Malchut was diminished, because she complained %0a%3c to the Creator: "Two angels cannot wear one crown"— if Malchut is equal to ZA %0a%3c in height, she cannot receive the Light of Hochma from him. %0a%3c %0a%3c The reason for that being— not having received the Light of Hassadim from %0a%3c ZA beforehand, Malchut cannot receive the Light of Hochma, as the Light of %0a%3c Hochma can only be received within the Light of Hassadim, by clothing the Light %0a%3c of Hochma (pleasure) into the Light of Hassadim (the intention to enjoy "for the %0a%3c Creator's sake"). %0a%3c %0a%3c And the Creator answered Malchut: "Go and diminish yourself." In other %0a%3c words: if, owing to your egoistic properties, you cannot receive the Light %0a%3c independently, but only from ZA, then diminish your own properties, accept %0a%3c His, and gradually correct yourself. Then you will be able to receive all of the %0a%3c Light and be like Him (ZA— the Creator). All of this is described in the Talmud %0a%3c (Hullin, 60:2), but only with the explanation provided in The Zohar do we stop %0a%3c perceiving it as a fairytale. %0a%3c %0a%3c Then Malchut descended below Yesod of ZA, and her nine lower Sefirot %0a%3c fell below Parsa into the worlds of BYA. And only her Sefira Keter remained %0a%3c in Atzilut as a point standing below Yesod of ZA. And from here on, Malchut %0a%3c is built not of her own Sefirot (properties) that exist in BYA, but of Sefirot %0a%3c (properties) Net^ah and Hod of ZA. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Flower Buds %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 65 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Although Malchut was previously bigger, she was not able to receive the %0a%3c Light for lack of the Light of Hassadim; now she will be smaller, but she will %0a%3c have the Light of Hassadim, in which she will be able to receive the Light of %0a%3c Hochma. Even though Malchut will be at a lower degree, she will be able to utilize %0a%3c it, for the Light of Hassadim repels the impure forces that cling to Nulcva. That %0a%3c is the meaning of the word Zamir (singing/ pruning). However, there is another %0a%3c meaning to this word that is at use here— cutting off, or pruning the impure %0a%3c forces from Malchut (rose bud). %0a%3c %0a%3c THE VOICE OF THE TURTLE DOVE: The turtle dove is a Sefira, the %0a%3c property of Net^ah de ZA, and the voice of the turtle dove represents Sefira Hod %0a%3c of ZA, the fifth day of creation. And since Malchut receives from Yesod (which %0a%3c receives from Hod that is joined with Netjah), such reception by Malchut is %0a%3c referred to as "the voice of the turtle dove." %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, the words "is heard" refer to the sixth day, since the voice of the %0a%3c turtle dove (Malchut) is heard only with the help of the sixth day, Yesod of ZA, %0a%3c which includes both Net^ah and Hod, and passes their Light to Malchut. Hence, %0a%3c it is said that this voice is heard in Malchut only from Yesod, on the sixth day. %0a%3c %0a%3c The reason for this is that Malchut can receive the Light only from the %0a%3c middle line of ZA: either from Yesod of ZA (she receives the degree called NHY, %0a%3c Ihur - embryo) or from Tifferet of ZA (she receives the degree called HGT = VAK, %0a%3c Yenilca - nursing or Katnut - smallness) or from Daat of ZA (she receives the %0a%3c degree called HBD = GAR, Mochin - brain or Gadlut - big). %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Left %0a%3c 1 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c LINES %0a%3c %0a%3c Middle %0a%3c %0a%3c _L_ %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Right %0a%3c 1 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c NAME %0a%3c OF DEGREE %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c THE LIGHT %0a%3c IN THE DEGREE %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ( Bina %0a%3c M %0a%3c %0a%3c i %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c )M %0a%3c Daat %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Hochma) %0a%3c 1 %0a%3c %0a%3c i %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c HBD {HaBaD) %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Light of Neshama %0a%3c = The light of HBD %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ( Gevura %0a%3c %0a%3c i %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ! , %0a%3c %0a%3c Tifferet %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Hesed J %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c HGT [HaGaT) %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Light of Ruach %0a%3c = The light of HGT %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c f Hod %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c H-( %0a%3c %0a%3c Yesod %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Netzah J %0a%3c j %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c NHY {NeHY) %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Light of Nefesh %0a%3c = The light of NHY %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 66 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c LET US MAKE MAN, FOR IN THE FUTURE HE SHALL PUT ACTION %0a%3c BEFORE LISTENING: sight refers to Sefira Hochma, hearing refers to Sefira %0a%3c Bina. Action or deed is a property of Malchut. In order to correct Malchut, the %0a%3c Creator's only creation (other Sefirot are properties of the Creator Himself, with %0a%3c which He gradually created Malchut), a second restriction was made— Malchut %0a%3c ascended to Bina so as to combine her egoistic properties of reception with %0a%3c Bina's altruistic properties of bestowal; Malchut ascended to Aba-Hochma, and %0a%3c Ima-Bina found herself below Malchut (Parsa), where she became similar in her %0a%3c properties to Malchut. %0a%3c %0a%3c Eyes refer to Sefira Hochma or Aba. Malchut ascended to the level of eyes and %0a%3c stands at the level of pupils. Malchut is called Nukva; and Malchut that stands %0a%3c at the level of eyes is called Nikvey Eynaim (pupils) or NE. That is why there are %0a%3c only Keter and Hochma in the Rosh (head) of AA: Bina fell from the Rosh to the %0a%3c Guf (body) and Malchut is above Bina, that is, Malchut represents an action that %0a%3c is Above, i.e., precedes perception and understanding. This is what is meant %0a%3c by "we will do, and we will hear"— the act of the second restriction, limiting %0a%3c reception only to GE. Such a state is called the "return" (in one's properties to %0a%3c the Creator). The "complete return" occurs when AHP of Malchut gets corrected %0a%3c and joins GE at this degree. %0a%3c %0a%3c As a result of Malchut's ascent to NE, she changes her properties (every one %0a%3c of us needs only this— to ascend to the level of the Creator's properties, so that %0a%3c we can receive them and become like Him), and is now ready to ascend to AVI %0a%3c and receive the Light of Haya. The constant Light of this level is called the First %0a%3c Temple. That is why when receiving the Torah, Israel elected to act first and hear %0a%3c after. And for this reason they merited reception of the Torah (Talmud, Shabbat, %0a%3c 85:1), as the action (Malchut) ascended and clothed AVI, and thus the secret of %0a%3c the fifty gates of Bina was revealed. %0a%3c %0a%3c Construction of the Temple does not pertain to it being built in this world, %0a%3c but rather to the attainment of the degree of the Temple, the degree of AVI %0a%3c de Atzilut, the Light of Haya (the First Temple) or the degree of YESH %0a%3c Atzilut, the Light of Neshama (the Second Temple). %0a%3c %0a%3c Here The Zohar tells us: "it is heard" on the sixth day, for on this day (in this %0a%3c state) Malchut was corrected by means of her ascent above Bina, referred to as %0a%3c "placing action before listening," to do and to hear as during the reception of %0a%3c the Torah. Malchut in the state of ascension to Bina is called the Eternal Land or %0a%3c the Land of Life, for she inherits life from Bina. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Flower Buds %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 67 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c "IN OUR LAND" REFERS TO SHABBAT, WHICH IS LIKE THE %0a%3c ETERNAL LAND OF LIFE: Ima-Bina is called the Land of Life or the Eternal %0a%3c Land. As a result of the act on the sixth day, meaning the Creator's action from %0a%3c Above (the factor of time is designated by an action of the Creator Himself, %0a%3c which has no causes in our world), Malchut ascended to Ima on the seventh day %0a%3c of creation (Shabbat) and became like Ima, for when the lower one ascends to %0a%3c the degree of the Upper One, they become equal (in properties). Hence, upon %0a%3c ascending to Bina and there receiving the Light of Haya, Malchut is called the %0a%3c Land of Eternal Life. %0a%3c %0a%3c 5. Another explanation: flower buds are the Patriarchs, who entered the mind %0a%3c and entered into the world to come, Bina, where they remain concealed. %0a%3c From there they emerge in concealment and conceal themselves in the true %0a%3c prophets. Yosef was born and they concealed themselves within him. When %0a%3c Yosef entered the Holy Land, he erected them there, and then "they appeared %0a%3c on the earth" and were revealed there. When did they appear? When a rainbow %0a%3c can be seen, they become revealed. At that moment, "the time of singing has %0a%3c come," meaning the time to eradicate all the wicked in the world. Why did %0a%3c they survive? Because the flower buds have appeared on (from) the earth. And %0a%3c if they were to be seen beforehand, they could not have remained in the %0a%3c world, and the world would not have been able to exist. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 68 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Here The Zohar explains the attainment of the Light of Haya by ZA. NHY of %0a%3c ZA are called "sons" and HGT of ZA are called "patriarchs," as well as the "turtle %0a%3c dove." ZA himself (seemingly) consists of two parts: above his Chazeh, his Sefirot %0a%3c HGT are called the big ZON; below his Chazeh, Sefirot NHY are called the small %0a%3c ZON. Sefirot HGT correspond to Avraham, Yitzchak and Yaakov, while NHY %0a%3c correspond to Moshe, Aaron and Yosef. Malchut corresponds to King David. %0a%3c %0a%3c Sefirot NHY are called "prophets," and Yesod is called "the righteous one." %0a%3c Here The Zohar speaks of the buds that gradually grow from the small state %0a%3c to the big state of ZON: first ZON were small, consisting of Sefirot NHY with %0a%3c the Light of Ne/esh and called Uhar (embryo). Then, with the help of Yenika %0a%3c (nursing), i.e., receiving Light from Ima, ZON grew. Accordingly, the properties %0a%3c of Sefirot NHY grew to equalize those of Sefirot HGT, and Sefirot NHY received %0a%3c the Light of Ruach. %0a%3c %0a%3c Thus, the Partzuf now consists of parts of HGT and NHY with the Lights %0a%3c Ruach and Ne/esh. Subsequently, by further reception of strength from the Upper %0a%3c One, and further growth, they've attained the state of Gadlut Aleph, the first big %0a%3c state. Accordingly, Sefirot HGT became HBD with the Light of Neshama, Sefirot %0a%3c NHY became Sefirot HGT, and received new Sefirot NHY. %0a%3c %0a%3c Thus, the Partzuf grew to include three parts: HBD, HGT, and NHY with the %0a%3c Lights Ne/esh, Ruach, and Nesharna. And it is called Gadol (big— the first big state). %0a%3c Then, through further growth, they've attainted the state of maturity (Gadlut %0a%3c Bet, the second big state), and the Light of Haya entered Sefirot HBD. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 1. Embryo 2. Small 3. Big %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Flower Buds %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 69 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The word "growth" refers to the growth of a screen, of man's inner anti- %0a%3c egoistic forces and desires. This is the only difference between a big vessel and %0a%3c a small one, the only difference between the Partzufim. Their inner properties %0a%3c change depending on the change in the magnitude of the screen. %0a%3c %0a%3c THESE FATHERS ENTERED THE SUPERNAL MIND AND %0a%3c ASCENDED INTO THE WORLD TO COME: this sentence speaks of the %0a%3c prenatal development of ZA, when he ascends to AVI (called "Supernal Mind" %0a%3c or "Supernal Thought"). Aba-Hochma is called "mind" or "thought," and lma- %0a%3c Bina is called "the world to come." And together they are called "parents"— father %0a%3c and mother, AVI. It is there that creation begins— conception of ZA in the initial %0a%3c state of a spiritual embryo. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ler, so can every man become a spiritual embryo; if he completely relinqui %0a%3c all of his desires and actions, and submits entirely to the will of the Upper %0a%3c Partzuf, he will turn himself into a spiritual embryo, just like a physiological %0a%3c one. The difference between a physiological embryo and a spiritual one lies %0a%3c in the fact that becoming a spiritual embryo requires tremendous personal %0a%3c sire and effort, whereas the conception of a physiological embryo deper %0a%3c rents. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c pends %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c As a result of its prenatal development within Bina (which means that one %0a%3c completely extinguishes all of his personal desires and thoughts, and, like an %0a%3c embryo, is ready to accept all that the mother gives: all of her thoughts and %0a%3c properties, regardless of how incomprehensible or unnatural they may seem to %0a%3c his essence), this embryo achieves the state of its spiritual birth. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, this is a state of an even greater concealment of the Upper Light %0a%3c with regard to the embryo, for it does not yet have a screen for the reception of %0a%3c this Light. Hence, this state is called Katnut, CONCEALED IN THE TRUE %0a%3c PROPHETS, i.e., in Sefirot Netzah and Hod, which ZA attains as a result of %0a%3c the process of nursing, reception of milk, the Light of Hassadim from Ima %0a%3c (mother) Bina. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Light of nursing comes to the NHY of ZA, and ZA attains VAK (Light %0a%3c of Nefesh-Ruach), the state of Katnut. During nursing, ZA attains the Sefira %0a%3c Yesod, which is why it is said that Yosef is born. After the nursing period is over, %0a%3c ZA ascends to AVI so as to receive from them the Light of Neshama, and this %0a%3c constitutes the state of Gadlut, called "Yosef." %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 70 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ZA consists of three parts: HBD, HGT, and NHY. The process of Zeir Anpin's %0a%3c growth, of acquiring a screen on his desires, begins with the purest, least egoistic %0a%3c part— Sefirot HBD, in which he first receives the Light of Nefesh. %0a%3c %0a%3c Afterwards, ZA acquires a screen on coarser egoistic desires— Sefirot HGT; %0a%3c the Light of Nefesh passes from HBD to HGT, and the Light of Ruach enters the %0a%3c empty HBD. %0a%3c %0a%3c Finally, ZA acquires a screen on the most egoistic Kelim— Sefirot NHY; the %0a%3c Light of Ne/esh passes from HGT to NHY, the Light of Ruach moves from HBD %0a%3c to the empty HGT, and the Light of Neshama enters the empty HBD. %0a%3c %0a%3c The attainment of the big state by ZA is called the birth of Yosef, for there %0a%3c emerge Sefirot NHY, of which the last Sefira, Yesod, is called "Yosef." However, %0a%3c since the Light of Haya is not yet present, this state is called "concealment." %0a%3c WHEN YOSEF ENTERED THE HOLY LAND AND ERECTED THEM %0a%3c THERE: that is, after the attainment of the first big state, the reception of the %0a%3c Light of Neshama, ZA continues to grow, cultivating his screen until the Light %0a%3c of Haya enters it. %0a%3c %0a%3c In such a state, Malchut of ZA separates from him into an independent %0a%3c Partzuf, called THE HOLY LAND, as the Light of Haya is called holiness. It %0a%3c is therefore said that Yosef entered or, rather, ASCENDED TO THE HOLY %0a%3c LAND in the Gadlut state of ZA. ZA and ~Nukva became equally big in the state %0a%3c of PBP (Panim be Panim, face to face), which is the state that determines the Zivug %0a%3c between ZON. %0a%3c %0a%3c AND YOSEF ERECTED THEM THERE: the Light of Haya or Hochma %0a%3c fills the Partzuf only during a Zivug, when ZON (ZA and Nukva) make a Zivug %0a%3c together. And this Light remains in Malchut, for only she (her screen) can %0a%3c reveal it. Just as AVI are GAR de Bina, YESHSLT is ZAT de Bina and the Light %0a%3c of Hochma is found only in YESHSLT, the relationship between Malchut and %0a%3c ZA works along the same principle, and the Light of Hochma is revealed only %0a%3c in Malchut. Therefore, only when the Light of Hochma fills Nu/cva can it be %0a%3c said that the Light has been revealed, and until that happens, it is considered %0a%3c to be concealed. %0a%3c %0a%3c WHEN ARE THEY SEEN? WHEN A RAINBOW CAN BE SEEN IN %0a%3c THE WORLD: ZA is called a "rainbow," the world is Malchut, and their union %0a%3c is called a "rainbow within a cloud." THE TIME HAS COME TO ERADICATE %0a%3c ALL THE WICKED FROM THE WORLD-as the number of the wicked grows, %0a%3c as more impure forces cling to ZON. The impure forces can influence ZON so %0a%3c greatly that the entire world will be brought to ruin, as has happened in the %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Flower Buds %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 71 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c time of the Flood. If so, there is no salvation for man other than through the %0a%3c revelation of the Upper Light, the Light of Haya. That is why The Zohar tells us %0a%3c that the world is saved by the flower buds appearing from the earth, meaning %0a%3c that the Light of Haya eradicates man's impure forces from the earth (his desires, %0a%3c Malchut), and they cannot cling to her and hinder man. %0a%3c %0a%3c AND HAD THEY NOT APPEARED, THERE WOULD BE NO %0a%3c SALVATION FOR THE WORLD-for initially Nuba is built as big as ZA. %0a%3c This is called the "two great celestial bodies," when Malchut is on the same %0a%3c degree as ZA, but stands behind him, back to back, unable to receive the %0a%3c Light of Hochma in the absence of the Light of Hassadim. This is why Malchut %0a%3c complains about lacking the Light of Hassadim and thus not being able to %0a%3c receive the Light of Hochma. %0a%3c %0a%3c Even though the moon grows as big as the Sun, it cannot shine independently, %0a%3c but only if the Sun (ZA) gives it Light. And since Malchut lacks the Light of %0a%3c Hochma, such a state is called reversed (Achor-back). And a Zivug cannot take %0a%3c place in the position of back-to-back (Achor he Achor). %0a%3c %0a%3c However, after Nukva is born and grows (receives the properties) from the %0a%3c Guf of ZA, as it is written in the Torah (Beresheet 2) that Chava (Eve) was born %0a%3c from the body of Adam, she becomes equal to ZA and enters into a Zivug face- %0a%3c to-face (Panim he Panim, PBP) with him. %0a%3c %0a%3c Also, Nukva still retained the previous Light. Moreover, precisely because %0a%3c she felt the lack of the Light in her initial state, Malchut received the Light of %0a%3c Haya specifically into her previous sufferings. Similarly, man can feel pleasure %0a%3c only and precisely because of his previous suffering. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, The Zohar tells us that had the flower buds not appeared in %0a%3c Malchut during her Katnut, when she was standing behind ZA, she would not %0a%3c have been able to receive the Light of Haya in her state of Gadlut, as she would %0a%3c not have the Kelim (desires) to receive this Light. Every new creation is founded %0a%3c on the sensation of darkness, as it is said: the Creator emanates the Light out of %0a%3c Himself, and creates darkness out of nothingness. Man's sensation of darkness %0a%3c signifies his readiness to receive the Light. %0a%3c %0a%3c 6. Who sustains the world and evokes the revelation of the Patriarchs? It is the %0a%3c voice of the children engaged in the Torah. The world exists thanks to these %0a%3c children. Hence, it is said: "We will make for you pendants of gold" (Shir %0a%3c HaShirim, 1:11). These are the children, youngsters of the world, as it is said: %0a%3c "Make two cherubs of gold" (Shemot, 25:18). %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 72 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Light of Ruach is called "the children of the world," and the Zivug in this %0a%3c state (PBA-face to back) is referred to as THE VOICE OF THE CHILDREN %0a%3c ENGAGED IN THE TORAH. And it is also called "threads of gold" and %0a%3c "two cherubs of gold." Before Nukva grew, the impure forces had the power to %0a%3c destroy the world. However, precisely because Nukva grows from ZA, the right %0a%3c and left lines merge in her as one, the RAINBOW (right line) shines WITHIN %0a%3c A CLOUD (left line), and the Light of Haya can enter Malchut. Without this %0a%3c Light, the world can be destroyed as during (in the state of) the Flood. %0a%3c %0a%3c SO WHO IS IT THAT SUSTAINS THE WORLD: who causes the %0a%3c appearance of the Light of Hayal They are precisely the children engaged in %0a%3c the Torah. The "children" designate the Light of the opposite side, the Light %0a%3c of Ruach, the sensation of deficiency of the Light of Haya, for a "child" alludes %0a%3c to the process of nursing. The children of the house of Raban (Tinokot Shel Beit %0a%3c Raban)— are the Light of Haya, as the word "Raban" derives from "Rat/" (big, %0a%3c Haya). They did not transgress, i.e., did not use their AHP (egoistic and yet %0a%3c uncorrected desires, for the word "children" designates the small state), their %0a%3c will to receive.%0a\ No newline at end of file%0a
