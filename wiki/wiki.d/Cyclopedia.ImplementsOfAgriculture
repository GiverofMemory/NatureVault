The prevailing herbage was red top, blue-grass, and fowl meadow; it was the hardest test for action in rough ground that could be found in the vicinity. The following is the result; the marks for quality of work were 1 to 40, the latter number indicating perfect work.%0aQuality of work.%0aSeymour, Morgan & Allen, No. 44%0aThe divider of this machine pressed down the grass, some of which was not cut off at the next round.	39%0aCayuga Chief, D, No. 16	37%0aCayuga Chief, A, No. 13	37%0aDodge, Stevenson & Co., No. 52 (wood)	37%0aDodge, Stevenson & Co., No. 53 (iron)%0aA spike projecting from the ground was half severed by this machine	37%0aD.

Wilber, No. 6	30%0a"Those who had been present at the former great trials, held by the society were astonished at the general perfection which had been attained by the manufacturers of mowing-machines. Every machine, with two exceptions, did good work, which would be acceptable to any farmer, and the appearance of the whole meadow after it had been raked over, was as good as it could be, and vastly better than the average mowing of the best farmers in the State, notwithstanding the great difficulties which they had to encounter. At previous trials most of the machines would clog more or less, and some of them so frequently that they were of no practical value. At this trial, not a single instance of clogging was observed either in clover or fine grass.%0a%0a"At previous trials, very few machines could stop in the grass and start without backing for a fresh start. At the present trial every machine stopped in the grass and started again without backing without any difficulty, and without leaving any perceptible ridge to mark the place where it occurred. We look upon these facts with pride and pleasure, as showing the great success which has attended the efforts of our mechanics to meet the requirements of the farmer, and we have good reason to believe that the experiments made at Auburn will lead to still greater advances in the path of progress.%0a%0a"Four machines were allowed to work at once, marked stakes being driven down at their entrance; they cut entirely around the lot, passing through all the different kinds of bottom and of grass, and into all the gullies and hollows. Then four more succeeded them, and so on in groups of four, until all had gone round. Then each machine cut a double swath across the lot. After this the whole number of machines were put in motion at once, until both meadows were cut down. In this way the path of each machine could be traced without difficulty through its entire length, and the work of each, under very different circumstances, could be accurately compared."%0a%0aREAPING TRIALS.%0a%0aThe wheat field was divided into thirty lots, of one acre each, the bottom generally smooth, tolerably level, and the grain (Mediterranean) stood up very well.%0aWalter A. Wood, entry No. 30, with a hand-raker. The gavels were twisted at the bottom from the left-hand corner towards the right. The binders bound ten of these gavels in 6 minutes. Time of cutting 49 minutes. Mark for quality of work, 33.%0a%0aD. M. Osborne, No. 27, using a reel and sweep rake. There is a want of a proper divider. The rake draws forwards some of the last cut straw, and in its next sweep this is twisted in raking. The twist is from the left-hand corner towards the right, and in the lower part of the gavel the twist is less than on the top, but what there is, is in the opposite direction. The binders bound ten bundles in 4 minutes. Time of cutting 53 1/2 minutes. Mark for quality of work, 33.%0a%0aCayuga Chief, J. No. 46, with a dropping attachment. The lower part of the gavel is drawn forward and somewhat twisted as it falls. It requires six men to keep up with the machine who occasionally fall behind with their work in bad places. The binders bound ten of these sheaves in 5 minutes. Time of cutting, 57 min. Mark for quality of work, 32.%0a%0aD. M. Osborne & Co., No. 19, hand-raker. The work is as good as can be done.

(MOWERS).%0a%0aThree machines seem to claim special consideration with regard to award of premiums, each having received the mark of 40, indicating perfect work. These machines were Buckeye, entry No. 10; Rhode Island Clipper, entry No. 18; and Wood's Mower, entry No. 8. Of these, the stubble of the two first were slightly the shortest, but the cutting in other respects was about the same, and was all that could be desired. The Buckeye, however, is the only one which received the perfect number (40) in both fields. We are constrained then by these facts to give the preference to the Buckeye for quality of work, so also as to ease of draft, side-draft, and durability. As to simplicity, the Committee were unable to discover much difference, though they gave to the Buckeye the preference as to portability and general ease of management. In view of these superiorities the Committee awarded the premium of the gold Medal in the first class to Adrience, Platt & Co., for their Buckeye Mower, entry No. 10.%0aClass 2. -- Hand-Rakes.%0a%0aBut two entries in this class, Osborne & Co's, No. 19, and C.

Y., in July, 1868, under the patronage of the Legislature and supervision of the New York State Agricultural Society, was the most thorough and extensive ever held in this country. Fifty-nine machines were entered for competition, and over two weeks occupied in subjecting the machines to every variety of severe tests. The Legislature of the State appropriated $5000 towards the expenses and premiums.%0a%3c The Committee of Judges was composed of practical and scientific agriculturists,* and included some of the first men of the State. The following synopsis of their report will be found to embody the main results of their investigation, and cannot fail of being of great use to Farmers. Invitations were extended to all the prominent Agricultural Implement Makers of the country. The following points were to be considered and determined by the Committee on trial.%0a%3c %0a%3c 1. Which is the cheapest machine.%0a%3c %0a%3c 2. The most simple in its construction.%0a%3c %0a%3c 3. The most durable.%0a%3c %0a%3c 4. Which requires the least power.%0a%3c %0a%3c 5. Which has the least side-draught.%0a%3c %0a%3c All of which is to be determined, and the capacity to perform a given amount of work in a workmanlike manner, in a given time, in the most economical way.%0a%3c %0a%3c 6. Which does the most work in the least time.%0a%3c %0a%3c 7. Which does the best work.%0a%3c %0a%3c 8. Which is managed with the most facility.%0a%3c %0a%3c When the Judges have determined the above questions, they will proceed to decide which of the machines is best adapted to the use of the farmer by having the greatest number of merits and the fewest defects.%0a%3c %0a%3c No exhibitor shall furnish other machines for trial than those which they habitually furnish from their shops to their customers.%0a%3c %0a%3c The following were the class divisions for entry of MOWERS and REAPERS.%0a%3c %0a%3c No. 1.

Wilber, No. 6	30%0a%3c "Those who had been present at the former great trials, held by the society were astonished at the general perfection which had been attained by the manufacturers of mowing-machines. Every machine, with two exceptions, did good work, which would be acceptable to any farmer, and the appearance of the whole meadow after it had been raked over, was as good as it could be, and vastly better than the average mowing of the best farmers in the State, notwithstanding the great difficulties which they had to encounter. At previous trials most of the machines would clog more or less, and some of them so frequently that they were of no practical value. At this trial, not a single instance of clogging was observed either in clover or fine grass.%0a%3c %0a%3c "At previous trials, very few machines could stop in the grass and start without backing for a fresh start. At the present trial every machine stopped in the grass and started again without backing without any difficulty, and without leaving any perceptible ridge to mark the place where it occurred. We look upon these facts with pride and pleasure, as showing the great success which has attended the efforts of our mechanics to meet the requirements of the farmer, and we have good reason to believe that the experiments made at Auburn will lead to still greater advances in the path of progress.%0a%3c %0a%3c "Four machines were allowed to work at once, marked stakes being driven down at their entrance; they cut entirely around the lot, passing through all the different kinds of bottom and of grass, and into all the gullies and hollows. Then four more succeeded them, and so on in groups of four, until all had gone round. Then each machine cut a double swath across the lot. After this the whole number of machines were put in motion at once, until both meadows were cut down. In this way the path of each machine could be traced without difficulty through its entire length, and the work of each, under very different circumstances, could be accurately compared."%0a%3c %0a%3c REAPING TRIALS.%0a%3c %0a%3c The wheat field was divided into thirty lots, of one acre each, the bottom generally smooth, tolerably level, and the grain (Mediterranean) stood up very well.%0a%3c Walter A. Wood, entry No. 30, with a hand-raker. The gavels were twisted at the bottom from the left-hand corner towards the right. The binders bound ten of these gavels in 6 minutes. Time of cutting 49 minutes. Mark for quality of work, 33.%0a%3c %0a%3c D. M. Osborne, No. 27, using a reel and sweep rake. There is a want of a proper divider. The rake draws forwards some of the last cut straw, and in its next sweep this is twisted in raking. The twist is from the left-hand corner towards the right, and in the lower part of the gavel the twist is less than on the top, but what there is, is in the opposite direction. The binders bound ten bundles in 4 minutes. Time of cutting 53 1/2 minutes. Mark for quality of work, 33.%0a%3c %0a%3c Cayuga Chief, J. No. 46, with a dropping attachment. The lower part of the gavel is drawn forward and somewhat twisted as it falls. It requires six men to keep up with the machine who occasionally fall behind with their work in bad places. The binders bound ten of these sheaves in 5 minutes. Time of cutting, 57 min. Mark for quality of work, 32.%0a%3c %0a%3c D. M. Osborne & Co., No. 19, hand-raker. The work is as good as can be done. Not a fault could be found with it in any way. Ten sheaves were bound in 4 minutes, 3 seconds. Time of cutting 64 1/2 minutes. Quality of work, 40.%0a%3c %0a%3c Lot No. 5 was cut by Dodge, Stevenson &; Co. No. 33, (wood), hand raker. The grain in this lot was lodged in one or two places. One man drove and raked, the sickle being set almost low enough for mowing. The gavels are crossed, the bottom towards the right and the top towards the left. Ten bundles bound in 5 minutes. Time 66 1/2 minutes. Quality of work, 30.%0a%3c %0a%3c Lot No. 6 was not a good one for reaping. It was cut by Adriance, Platt & Co., No. 31, hand raker. It was cut the wrong way and a good deal of the lodged was left upon the ground. It was thrown off the platform with a fork instead of a rake. The gavels were not very good. Time 47 minutes.

(MOWERS).%0a%3c %0a%3c Three machines seem to claim special consideration with regard to award of premiums, each having received the mark of 40, indicating perfect work. These machines were Buckeye, entry No. 10; Rhode Island Clipper, entry No. 18; and Wood's Mower, entry No. 8. Of these, the stubble of the two first were slightly the shortest, but the cutting in other respects was about the same, and was all that could be desired. The Buckeye, however, is the only one which received the perfect number (40) in both fields. We are constrained then by these facts to give the preference to the Buckeye for quality of work, so also as to ease of draft, side-draft, and durability. As to simplicity, the Committee were unable to discover much difference, though they gave to the Buckeye the preference as to portability and general ease of management. In view of these superiorities the Committee awarded the premium of the gold Medal in the first class to Adrience, Platt & Co., for their Buckeye Mower, entry No. 10.%0a%3c Class 2. -- Hand-Rakes.%0a%3c %0a%3c But two entries in this class, Osborne & Co's, No. 19, and C. Wheeler, jr. No. 20. D. M. Osborne & Co., entry No. 19 having the most good points, the gold Medal was awarded to them.%0a%3c Class 2 1/2. - Self-Raker.%0a%3c %0a%3c Five competitors here. Medal awarded to Seymour, Morgan & Allen, New York, entry No. 27 1/2. The committee, however, strongly recommend C. C. Bradley & Son, entry No. 22.%0a%3c Class 3.-Combined Mower and Reaper, Hand-Rakes.%0a%3c %0a%3c The claims in this class rested between Cayuga Chief, H. entry No. 35, Eagle No. 29, and W. A. Wood, entry No. 30; all of them had special advantages. The medal was awarded, however, to W. A. Wood, entry No. 30.%0a%3c Class 4. - Combined Reaper with self-raking or dropping attachments.%0a%3c %0a%3c Ten competitors in this class. Medal awarded to Williams, Wallace & Co., entry 42.%0a%3c Class 5. - Combined Reaper, Self and Hand Rakes.%0a%3c %0a%3c As desired.
