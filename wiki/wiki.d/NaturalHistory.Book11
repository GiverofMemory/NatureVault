(1.) THE EXTREME SMALLNESS OF INSECTS. %0a%0aWe shall now proceed to a description of the insects, a %0asubject replete with endless difficulties ;^ for, in fact, there %0aare some authors who have maintained that they do not respire, %0aand that they are destitute of blood. The insects are numerous, %0aand form many species, and their mode of life is like that of %0athe terrestrial animals and the birds. Some of them are fur- %0anished with wings, bees for instance ; others are divided into %0athose kinds which have wings, and those which are without %0athem, such as ants ; while others, again, are destitute of both %0awings and feet. All these animals have been very properly %0acalled "insects,"^ from the incisures or divisions which sepa- %0arate the body, sometimes at the neck, and sometimes at the %0acorselet, and so divide it into members or segments, only %0aunited to each other by a slender tube. In some insects, how- %0aever, this division is not complete, as it is surrounded by %0awrinkled folds ; and thus the flexible vertebrae of the creature, %0awhether situate at the abdomen, or whether only at the upper %0apart of the body, are protected by layers, overlapping each %0aother ; indeed, in no one of her works has Nature more fully %0adisplayed her exhaustless ingenuity. %0a%0a(2.) In large animals, on the other hand, or, at all events, %0a%0a' " Immensifi subtilitatis." As Cuvier remarks, the ancients have com- %0amitted more errors in reference to the insects, than to any other portion of %0athe animal world. The discovery of the microscope has served more than %0aanything to correct these erroneous notions. %0a%0a* " Insecta," "articulated." %0a%0aVOL. 111. B %0a%0a%0a%0a%0aBOOK XI. %0a%0a%0a%0a2 %0a%0a%0a%0aflint's natural history. %0a%0a%0a%0a[Book XI. %0a%0a%0a%0ain the rery largest among them, she found hor task easy and %0aher materials ready and pliable ; but in those minute creatures, %0aso nearly akin as they are to non-entity, how surpassing the %0aintelligence, how vast the resources, and how ineffable the %0aperfection which she has displayed. Where is it that she has %0aunited so many senses as in the gnat ? — not to speak of creatures %0athat might be mentioned of still smaller size — Where, I say, %0ahas she found room to place in it the organs of sight ? Where %0ahas she centred the sense of taste ? Where has she inserted %0athe power of smell ? And where, too, has she implanted that %0asharp shrill voice of the creature, so utterly disproportioned to %0athe smallness of its body ? With what astonishing subtlety %0ahas she united the wings to the trunk, elongated the joints %0aof the legs, framed that long, craving concavity for a belly, and %0athen inflamed the animal with an insatiate thirst for blood, %0athat of man more especially! What ingenuity has she displayed %0ain providing it with a sting,^ so well adapted for piercing the %0askin! And then too, just as though she had had the most %0aextensive field for the exercise of her skill, although the %0aweapon is so minute that it can hardly be seen, she has formed %0ait with a twofold mechanism, providing it with a point for the %0apurpose of piercing, and at the same moment making it hollow, %0ato adapt it for suction. %0a%0aWhat teeth, too, has she inserted in the teredo,* to adapt it %0afor piercing oak even with a sound which fully attests their %0adestructive power ! while at the same time she has made wood %0aits principal nutriment. We give all our admiration to the %0ashoulders of the elephant as it supports the turret, to the %0astalwart neck of the bull, and the might with which it hurls %0aaloft whatever comes in its way, to the onsknight of the tiger, %0aor to the mane of the lion ; while, at the same tluiu, Nature is %0anowhere to be seen to greater perfection than in the very %0asmallest of her works. For this reason then, I must beg of %0amy readers, notwithstanding tlie contempt they feel for many %0aof these objects, not to feel a similar disdain for the informa- %0ation I am about to give relative thereto, seeing that, in the %0a%0a^ The trunk of the gnat, Cuvier says, contains five silken and pointed %0athreads, vrhich together have the effect of a sting. %0a%0a* The Teredo navalis of Linnaeus, not an insect, but one of the mollusks. %0aThis is the same creature that is mentioned in B. xvi. c. 80 ; but that spoken %0aof in B. viii. c. 74, must have been a laud insect. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 2.] %0a%0a%0a%0aINSECTS. %0a%0a%0a%0a3 %0a%0a%0a%0astudy of 2^ature, there are none of her works that are unworthy %0aof our consideration. %0a%0aCHAP. 2. (3.) WHETHEE INSECTS RESPIRE, AND WHETHER %0a%0aTHEY HAVE BLOOD. %0a%0aMany authors deny that insects respire,^ and make the %0aassertion upon the ground, that in their viscera there is no %0arespiratory organ to be found. On this ground, they assert %0athat insects liave the same kind of life as plants and trees, %0athere being a very great difference between respiring and merely %0ahaving life. On similar grounds also, thej assert that insects %0ahave no blood, a thiug which cannot exist, they say, in any %0aanimal that is destitute of heart and liver ; just as, according %0ato them, those creatures cannot breathe which have no lungs. %0aUpon these points, however, a vast number of questions will %0anaturally arise ; for the same writers do not hesitate to deny %0athat these creatures are destitute also of voice,* and this, %0anotwithstanding the humming of bees, the chirping of grass- %0ahoppers, and the sounds emitted by numerous other insects %0aM'liich will be considered in their respective places. For my %0apart, whenever I have considered the subject, I have ever felt %0apersuaded that there is nothing impossible to Nature, nor do I %0asee why creatures should be less able to live and yet not %0ainhale, than to respire without being possessed of viscera, a %0adoctrine which I have already maintained, when speaking' of %0athe marine animals ; and that, notwithstanding the density %0aand the vast depth of the water which would appear to impede %0aall breathing, j; o ,'.']i;it person could very easily believe that %0athere can be any iirvdii-^s that fly to and fro, and live in the %0avery midst of the c.i^n\Q:. (• uf respiration, Avhile, at the same time, %0athey themselves are devoid of that respiration ; that they can %0abe possessed of the requisite instincts for nourishment, gene- %0aration, working, and making provision even for time to come, %0ain the enjoyment too (although, certainly, they are not pos- %0asessed of the organs which act, as it were, as the receptacles %0a%0a* They respire by orifices in the sides of the body, known to naturalists %0aas stigmata. The wLole body, Cuvier says, forms, in a measure, a system of %0alunge. %0a%0aI" Cuvier remarks that the various noises made by insects are in reality %0anot the voice, as they arc not produced by air passing through a larynx. %0a■> U. ix. c.

That these creatures have no blood « %0aI am ready to admit, just as all the terrestrial animals are not %0apossessed of it ; but then, they have something similar, by way %0aof equivalent. Just as in the sea, the s£epia^ has a black %0aliquid in place of blood, and the various kinds of purples, those %0ajuices which we use for the purposes of dyeing ; so, too, is every %0ainsect possessed of its own vital humour, which, whatever it %0ais, is blood to it. "While I leave it to others to form what %0aopinion they please on this subject, it is my purpose to set %0aforth the operations of Nature in the clearest possible light, %0aand not to enter upon the discussion of points that are replete %0awith doubt. %0a%0aCHAP. 3. (4.) — THE BODIES OF INSECTS. %0a%0aInsects, 80 far as I find myself able to ascertain, seem to %0ahave neither sinews,'" bones, spines, cartilages, fat, nor flesh ; %0anor yet so much as a frail shell, like some of the marine ani- %0amals, nor even anything that can with any propriety be %0atermed skin ; but they have a body which is of a kind of inter- %0amediate nature between all these, of an arid substance, softer %0athan muscle, and in other respects of a natixre that may, in %0astrictness, be rather pronounced yielding," than hard. Such, %0athen, is all that they are, and nothing more : in the inside %0aof their bodies there is nothing, except in some few, which %0ahave an intestine arranged in folds. Hence it is, that even %0awhen cut asunder, they are remarkable for their tenacity of %0alife, and the palpitations which are to be seen in each of their %0aparts. For every portion of them is possessed of its own %0avital principle, which is centred in no limb in particular, but %0a%0a* Cuvier remarks, that they have a nourishing fluid, which is of a white %0acolour, and acts in place of hlood. %0a%0aThe dye of stepia, Cuvier remarks, is not blood, nor does it act as such, %0abeing an excrementitious liquid. It has in addition a bluish, transparent, %0ablood. The same also with the juices of the purple. %0a%0a10 "Nervos." Cuvier says that all insects have a brain, a sort of spinal %0amarrow, and nerves. %0a%0au "Tutius." %0a%0a'2 Insects have no fat, Cuvier says, except when in the chrysahs state ; %0abut they have a fibrous flesh of a whitisb colour. They have also viscera, %0atrachea, nerves, and a most complicated organization. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 5.] %0a%0a%0a%0aBEES. %0a%0a%0a%0a5 %0a%0a%0a%0ain every part of the body ; least of all, however, in the head, %0awhich alone is subject to no movements unless torn off together %0awith the corselet. No kind of animal has more feet than the %0ainsects have, and those among them which have the most, live %0athe longest when cut asunder, as we see in the case of the scolo- %0apendra. They have eyes, and the senses as well of touch and %0ataste ; some of them have also the sense of smelling, and some %0afew that of hearing. %0a%0aCHAP. 4. (5.) BEES. %0a%0aBut among them all, the first rank, and our especial admi- %0aration, ought, in justice, to be accorded to bees, which alone, %0aof all the insects, have been created for the benefit of man. %0aThey extract honey and collect it, a juicy substance remarkable %0afor its extreme sweetness, lightness, and wholesomeness. They %0aform their combs and collect wax, an article that is useful for %0aa thousand purposes of life ; thej^ are patient of fatigue, toil at %0atheir labours, form themselves into political communities, hold %0acouncils together in private, elect chiefs in common, and, a thing %0athat is the most remarkable of all, have their own code of morals. %0aIn addition to this, being as they are, neither tame nor wild, %0a80 all-powerful is Nature, that, from a creature so minute as to %0abe nothing more hardly than the shadow of an animal, she has %0acreated a marvel beyond all comparison. What muscular %0apower, what exertion of strength are we to put in comparison %0awith such vast energy and such industry as theirs ? What dis- %0aplay of human genius, in a word, shaJl we compare with the %0areasoning powers manifested by them ? In this they have, at %0aall events, the advantage of us — they know of nothing but what %0ais for the common benefit of all. Away, then, with all questions %0awhether they respire or no, and let us be ready to agree on %0athe question of their blood ; and yet, how little of it can pos- %0asibly exist in bodies so minute as theirs. — And now let us %0aform some idea of the instinct they display. %0a%0aCHAP. 5. (6.) THE OEDEE DISPLAYED IN THE WORKS OP BEES. %0a%0aBees keep within the hive during the winter — for whence %0aare they to derive the strength requisite to withstand frosts %0aand snows, and the northern blasts ? The same, in fact, is %0adone by all insects, but not to so late a period; as those %0a%0a%0a%0a6 %0a%0a%0a%0aPLINY'S NATTJEAL HISTOET. %0a%0a%0a%0a[Book XL %0a%0a%0a%0awhich conceal themselves in the walls of our houses, are much %0asooner sensible of the returning warmth. With reference to %0abees, either seasons and climates have considerably changed, or %0aelse former writers have been greatly mistaken. They retire %0afor the winter at the setting of the Vcrgilise, and remain shut %0aup till after the rising of that constellation, and not till only %0athe beginning of spring, as some authors have stated ; nor, in- %0adeed, does any one in Italy ever think of then opening the hives. %0aThey do not come forth to ply their labours until the bean %0ablossoms ; and then not a day do they lose in inactivity, while %0athe weather is favourable for their pursuits. %0a%0aFirst of all, they set about constructing their combs, and %0aforming the wax, or, in other words, making their dwellings %0aand cells ; after this they produce their young, and then make %0ahoney and wax from flowers, and extract bee-glue'^ from the %0atears of those trees which distil glutinous substances, the %0ajuices, gums, and resins, namely, of the willow, the elm, and %0athe reed. With these substances, as well as others of a more %0abitter nature, they first line the whole inside of the hive, as a %0asort of protection against the greedy propensities of other small %0ainsects, as they are well aware that they are about to form %0athat which will prove an object of attraction to them. Having %0adone this, they employ similar substances in narrowing the %0aentrance to the hive, if otherwise too wide. %0a%0aCHAP. 6.

This is to serve as the food of the bees while %0athey are at work, and is often found stowed away in the cavi- %0aties of the cells, being of a bitter flavour also. It is produced %0afrom the spring dews and the gummy juices of trees, being %0aless abundant while the south-west wind is blowing, and %0ablackened by the prevalence of a south wind. On the other %0ahand, again, it is of a reddish colour and becomes improved b}^ %0athe north-east wind ; it is found in the greatest abundance upon %0athe nut trees in Greece.

They %0apursue their labours within three-score paces of their hives ; %0aand when the flowers in their vicinity are exhausted, they %0asend out scouts from time to time, to discover places for forage %0aat a greater distance. When overtaken by night in their ex- %0apeditions, they watch till the morning, lying on their backs, %0ain order to protect their wings from the action of the dew. %0a%0aCHAP. 9. (9.) PERSONS AVHO HAVK MADE BEES THElll STUDY. %0a%0aIt is not surprising that there have been persons who have %0amade bees their exclusive study ; Aristomachus of Soli, for %0ainstance, who for a period of fifty-eight years did nothing else ; %0aPhiliscus of Thasos, also, surnamed Agrius,^^ who passed his %0alife in desert spots, tending swarms of bees. Both of these %0ahave written works on this subject. %0a%0aCHAP. 10. (10.) THE MODE IN WHICH BEES WORK. %0a%0aThe manner in which bees carry on their work is as follows. %0aIn the day time a guard is stationed at the entrance of the %0ahive, like the sentries in a camp. At night they take their %0arest until the morning, when one of them awakes the rest vdth. %0aa humming noise, repeated twice or thrice, just as though it were %0asounding a trumpet. They then take their flight in a body, %0aif the day is likely to turn out fine ; for they have the gift of %0aforeknowing wind and rain, and in such case will keep close %0awithin their dwellings. On the other hand, when the weather is %0afine — and this, too, they have the power of foreknowing — the %0aBwarm issues forth, and at once applies itself to its work, some %0aloading their legs from the flowers, while others fill their %0amouths with Avater, and charge the downy surface of their %0abodies with drops of liquid. Those among them that are %0ayoung go forth to their labours, and collect the materials %0aalready mentioned, while those that are more aged stay within %0athe hives and work. The bees whose business it is to cany %0athe flowers, with their fore feet load their thighs, which Nature %0ahas made rough for the purpose, and Avith their trunks load %0a%0a2* Or, the "wild man." %0a%0a22 Huber has discovered that there are two kinds of bees of neutral sex, %0aor, as he calls them, unprolific females, tlie workers, which so out, and %0athe nurses, which are smaller, and stay in the hive to tend the larvje. %0a%0a%0a%0aCbap. 10.] %0a%0a%0a%0aBEES. %0a%0a%0a%0a9 %0a%0a%0a%0atheir fore feet : bending beneath their load, they then return %0ato the hive, where there are three or four bees ready to receive %0athem and aid in discharging their burdens. For, within the %0ahive as well, they have their allotted duties to perform : some %0aare engaged in building, others in. smoothing, the combs, while %0aothers again are occupied in passing on the materials, and %0aothers in preparing food'-^ from the provision which has been %0abi'ought ; that there may be no unequal division, either in their %0alabour, their food, or the distribution of their time, they do not %0aeven feed separately. %0a%0aCommencing at the vaulted roof of the hive, they begin %0athe construction of their cells, and, just as we do in the manu- %0afacture of a web, they construct their cells from top to bottom, %0ataking care to leave two passages around each compartment, %0afor the entrance of some and the exit of others. The combs, %0awhich are fastened to the hive in the upper part, and in a %0aslight degree also at the sides, adhere to each other, and are %0athus suspended altogether. They do not touch the floor of the %0ahive, and are either angular or round, according to its shape ; %0asometimes, in fact, they are both angular and round at once, %0awhen two swarms are living in unison, but have dissimilar %0amodes of operation. They prop up the combs that are likely %0ato fall, bj' means of arched pillars, at intervals springing from %0athe floor, so as to leave them a passage . for the purpose of %0aeflccting repairs. The first three ranks of their cells are gene- %0arally left empty Avhen constructed, that there may be nothing %0aexposed to view which may invite theft ; and it is the last %0aones, more especially, that are filled with honey : hence %0ait is that the combs are always taken out at the back of the %0ahive. %0a%0aThe bees that are employed in carrying look out for a favour- %0aable breeze, and if a gale should happen to spring up, they %0apoise themselves in the air with little stones, by way of bal- %0alast ; some writers, indeed, say that they place them upon their %0ashoulders. When the wind is contrary, they fly close to the %0aground, taking care, however, to keep clear of the brambles. %0aIt is wonderful what strict watch is kept upon their work : all %0ainstances of idleness are carefully remarked, the offenders are %0a%0aFrom the honey found in the corolla; of flowers. This, after heing %0aprepared in the first stomach of the bee, is deposited in the cell which is %0aformed for its reception. %0a%0a%0a%0a10 %0a%0a%0a%0aPLIirr's NATUEAL HISTOET. %0a%0a%0a%0a[Book XL %0a%0a%0a%0achastised, and on a repetition of the fault, punished with death. %0aTheir sense of cleanliness, too, is quite extraordinary ; everj^- %0athing is removed that might he in the way, and no filth is %0aallowed to remain in the midst of their work. The ordure %0aeven of those that are at work within, that they may not have %0ato retire to any distance, is all collected in one spot, and on %0astormy days, when they are obliged to cease their ordinary %0alabours, they employ themselves in carrj-ing it out. When %0ait grows towards evening, the buzzing in the hive becomes %0agi-adually less and less, until at last one of their number is to %0abe seen fiying about the hive with the same loud humming %0anoise with which they were aroused in the morning, there- %0aby giving the signal, as it were, to retire to rest : in this, too, %0athey imitate the usage of the camp. The moment the signal %0ais heard, aU is silent. %0a%0a(11.) They first construct the dwellings of the commonalty, %0aand then those of the king-bee. If they have reason to expect %0aan abundant ^ season, they add abodes also for the drones : %0athese are ceUs of a smaller size, though the drones themselves %0aare larger than the bees. %0a%0aCHAP. 11. — DEONES. %0a%0aThe drones have no sting,-* and would seem to be a kind of %0aimperfect bee, formed the very last of all ; the expiring effort, %0aas it were, of worn-out and exhausted old age, a late and tardy %0aofi'spring, and doomed, in a measure, to be the slaves of the %0agenuine bees. Hence it is that the bees exercise over them a %0arigorous authority, compel them to take the foremost rank in %0atheir labours, and if they show any sluggishness, punish them*' %0awithout mercy. And not only in their labours do the drones %0agive them their assistance, but in the propagation of their spe- %0acies as well, the very multitude of them contributing greatly %0ato the warmth of the hive. At all events, it is a well-known %0afact, that the greater"^ the multitude of the drones, the more %0a%0aCuvier says that the three kinds of cells are absolutely necessary, and %0athat they do not depend on the greater or less abundance. The king of %0athe ancients is what we know as the queen bee, which is impregnated by the %0adrones or males. %0a%0a26 This is the fact, but not so their imperfect state. %0a%0a2' They do not work, but merely impregnate the queen ; after which %0athey are driven from the hive, and perish of cold and starvation. %0a%0a"■^ It appears, as Cuvier says, that the ancients had some notion that the %0aswarm was multiplied by the aid of the drones. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 12.] %0a%0a%0a%0aQTTALTTIES OF HO>"ET. %0a%0a%0a%0a11 %0a%0a%0a%0anumerous is sure to be the progeny of the swarm. When fhe %0ahoney is beginning to come to maturity, the bees drive away %0athe drones, and setting upon each in great numbers, put them %0aall to death. It is only in the spring that the drones are %0aever to be seen. If you deprive a drone of its wings, and then %0areplace it in the hive, it will pull off the wings of the other %0adrones. %0a%0aCH.\P. 12, — THE QtrALITIES OF HOITEY. %0a%0aIn the lower part of the hive they construct for their future %0asovereign a palatial abode,-'' spacious and grand, separated from %0athe rest, and surmounted by a sort of dome : if this promi- %0anence should happen to be flattened, all hopes of progeny- are %0alost. All the cells are hexagonal, each foot^" having formed %0aits own side. No part of this work, however, is done at any %0astated time, as the bees seize every opportunity for the perform- %0aance of their task when the days are fine ; in one or two %0adays, at most, they fill their cells with honey. %0a%0a(12.) This substance is engendered from the air,^- mostly at %0athe rising of the constellations, and more especially when %0aSirius is shining ; never, however, before the rising of the %0aVergiliae, and then just before day-break. Hence it is, that at %0aearly dawn the leaves of the trees are found covered with a %0akind of honey-like dew, and those who go into the open air at %0aan early hour in the morning, find their clothes covered, and %0atheir hair matted, with a sort of unctuous liquid. "Whether %0ait is that this liquid is the sweat of the heavens, or whether %0au saliva emanating from the stars, or a juice exuding from the %0aair while purifying itself, would that it had been, when it %0acom.e8 to us, pure, limpid, and genuine, as it was, when first %0ait took its downward descent. But as it is, falling from so %0avast a height, attracting corruption in its passage, and tainted %0aby the exhalations of the earth as it meets them, sucked, too, %0aas it is from off the trees and the herbage of the fields, and %0aaccumulated in the stomachs of the bees — for they cast it up %0a%0a2' Cuvier says that the cell for the future queen is different from the %0aothers, and much larger. The bees also supply the queen larva much more %0aabundantly with food, and of more delicate quality. %0a%0a^" (Cuvier says that this coincidence with the number of the legs is quite %0aaccidental, as it is with the mouth that the animal constructs the cell. %0aThe basis of it is really derived from the calix or corolla of flowers. %0a%0a%0a%0aI %0a%0a%0a%0a12 %0a%0a%0a%0aplutt's natueal histoet. %0a%0a%0a%0a[Book XI. %0a%0a%0a%0aagain through the mouth— deteriorated besides by the juices %0aof flowers, and then steeped within the hives and subjected to %0asuch repeated changes— still, in spite of all this, it aflords us %0aby its flavour a most exquisite pleasure, the result, no doubt, %0aof its aethereal nature and origin. %0a%0aCHAP. 13. (13.) WHEKE THE BEST HONEY IS PRODUCED. %0a%0aThe honey is always best in those countries where it is to %0abe found deposited in the calix of the most exquisite flowers, %0asuch, for instance, as the districts of Hymettus and Hybla, %0ain Attica and Sicily respectively, and after them the island of %0aCalydna.^- At first, honey is thin, like water, after which it %0aeffervesces for some days, and purifies itself like must. On %0athe twentieth day it begins to thicken, and soon after becomes %0acovered with a thin membrane, which gradually increases %0athrough the scum which is thrown up by the heat. The %0ahoney of the very finest flavour, and the least tainted by the %0aleaves of trees, is that gathered from the foKage of the oak %0aand the linden, and from reeds. %0a%0aCHAP. 14. (14.) — THE KINDS OF HONEY PECtJXIAK TO VARIOUS %0aPLACES. %0a%0aThe peculiar excellence of honey depends, as already stated," %0aon the country in which it is produced ; the modes, too, of %0aestimating its quality are numerous. In some countries we find %0athe honey-comb remarkable for the goodness of the wax, as iu %0aSicily, for instance, and the country of the Peligni ; in other %0aplaces the honey itself is found in greater abundance, as in %0aCrete, Cyprus, and Africa ; and in others, again, the comb is %0aremarkable for its size ; the northern climates, for instance, %0afor in Germany a comb has been known to be as much as eight %0afeet in length, and quite black on the concave surface. %0a%0aButwhatever the country in which it may happen to have been %0aproduced, there are three different kinds of honey. — Spring %0ahoney is that made in a comb which has been constructed of %0aflowers, from which cii'cumstance it has received the name of %0athinum. There are some persons who say that this should not %0abe touched, because the more abundant the nutriment, the %0a%0a32 See B. iv. c. 24. 33 the last Chapter. %0a%0a34 Qr " Flower-honey." %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 14.] %0a%0a%0a%0aVAHIOTJS KIKDS OF HONEY. %0a%0a%0a%0a13 %0a%0a%0a%0astronger Avill be the coming swarm ; while others, again, leave %0aless of this honey than of any other for the bees, on the ground %0athat there is sure to be a vast abundance at the rising of the %0agreater constellations, as well as at the summer solstice, when %0athe thyme and the vine begin to blossom, for then they are %0asure to find abundant materials for their cells. %0a%0aIn taking the combs the greatest care is always requisite, for %0awhen they are stinted for food the bees become desperate, and %0aeither pine to death, or else wing their flight to other places : %0abut on the other hand, over-abundance will entail idleness, %0aand then they will feed upon the honey, and not the bee-bread. %0aHence it is that the most careful breeders take care to leave %0athe bees a fifteenth part of this gathering. There is a certain %0aday for beginning the honey-gathering, fixed, as it were, by a %0alaw of Nature, if men would only understand or observe it, %0abeing the thirtieth day after the bees have swarmed and come %0aforth. This gathering mostly takes place before the end of %0aMay. %0a%0aThe second kind of honey is "summer honey," which, from %0athe circumstance of its being produced at the most favourable %0aseason, has received the Greek name of horaion it is gene- %0arally made during the next thirty days after the solstice, while %0aSirius is shining in all its brilliancy. Nature has revealed in %0athis substance most remarkable properties to mortals, were it %0anot that the fraudulent propensities of man are apt to falsify %0aand corrupt everything. For, after the rising of each constel- %0alation, and those of the highest rank more particularly, or after %0athe appearance of the rainbow, if a shower does not ensue, %0abut the dew becomes warmed by the sun's rays, a medicament, %0aand not real honey, is produced ; a gift sent from heaven for %0athe cure of diseases of the eyes, ulcers, and maladies of the %0ainternal viscera. If this is taken at the rising of Sirius, and %0athe rising of Yenus, Jupiter, or Mercury should happen to fall %0aon the same day, as ' often is the case, the sweetness of this %0asubstance, and the virtue which it possesses of restoring men %0ato life, are not inferior to those attributed to the nectar of the %0agods. %0a%0a%0a%0a3* Season-honey. %0a%0a%0a%0a14 %0a%0a%0a%0aPLI^^l's NATUEAL HISTOSr. %0a%0a%0a%0a[Book XI. %0a%0a%0a%0aCHAP. 15. (16.) HOW HONEY IS TESTED. HIUC-IIUM. XEIRA- %0a%0aUX, OK SISIUUM. %0a%0aThe crop of honey is most abundant if gathered at full %0amoon, and it is richest when the weather is fine. In all %0ahoney, that which flows of itself, like must or oil, has received %0afrom'us the name of acetum."^ The summer honey is the most %0aesteemed of all, from the fact of its being made when the %0aweather is driest : it is looked upon as the most serviceable %0awhen made from thyme it is then of a golden colour, and %0aof a most delicious flavour. The honey that we sec formed %0ain the calix of flowers is of a rich and unctuous nature ; that %0awhich is made from rosemary is thick, while that Avhich is %0acandied is little esteemed. Thyme honey does not coagulate, %0aand on being touched will draw out into thin viscous threads, %0aa thing which is the principal proof of its heaviness. When %0ahoney shows no tenacity, and the drops immediately part %0afr"om one another, it is looked upon as a sign of its worthless- %0aness. The other proofs of its goodness are the fine aroma of %0aits smell, its being of a sweetness that closely borders on the %0asour,^^ and being glutinous and pellucid. %0a%0aCassius Dionysius is of opinion that in the summer gathering %0athe tenth part of the honey ought to be left for the bees if the %0ahives should happen to be well filled, and even if not, still iu %0athe same proportion ; while, on the other hand, if there is but %0alittle in them, he recommends that it should not be touched %0aat aU. The people of Attica have fixed the period for com- %0amencing this gathering at the first ripening of the wild fig ; %0aothers have made it the daj^ that is sacred to Vulcan.*" %0a%0a(16.) The third kind of honey, which is the least esteemed %0aof all, is the wild honey, known by the name of ericcBum}^ It %0ais collected by the bees after the first showers of autumn, %0awhen the heather*^ alone is blooming in the woods, from which %0acircumstance it derives its sandy appearance.

Some persons delay the gathering of %0athe summer honey until the rising of Ai'cturus, because from %0athen till the autumnal equinox there are fourteen days left, %0aand it is from the equinox till the setting of the Vergilise, a pe- %0ariod of forty-eight days, that the heather is in the greatest abun- %0adance. The Athenians call this plant by the name of tetralix,^^ %0aand the Euboeans sisimvi, and they look upon it as aifording %0agreat pleasure to the bees to browse upon, probably because %0athere are no other flowers for them to resort to. This gather- %0aing terminates at the end of the vintage and the setting of %0athe Yergilia), mostly about the ides of November.'*-' Expe- %0arience teaches us that we ought to leave for the bees two- %0athirds of this crop, and always that part of the combs as well, %0awhich contains the bee-bread. %0a%0aFrom the winter solstice to the rising of Arcturus the bees %0aare buried in sleep for sixty days, and live without any nourish- %0ament. Between the rising of Arcturus and the vernal equinox, %0athey awake in the warmer climates, but even then they still %0akeep within the hives, and have recourse to the provisions %0akept in reserve for this period. In Italy, however, they do %0athis immediately after the rising of the Vergilije, up to which %0aperiod they are asleep. Some persons, when they take the %0ahoney, weigh the hive and all, and remove just as much as %0athey leave : a due sense of equity should always be stringently %0aobserved in dealing with them, and it is generally stated that %0aif imposed upon in this division, the swarm will die of grief. %0aIt is particularly recommended also that the person who takes %0athe honey should be well washed and clean : bees have a par- %0aticular aversion, too, to a thief and a menstnious woman.

THE KKPRODtJCTIOX OF BEES. %0a%0aHow bees generate their young has been a subject of great %0aand subtle research among the learned ; seeing that no one has %0aever witnessed" any sexual intercourse among these insects. %0aMany persons have expressed an opinion that they must be %0aproduced from flowers, aptly and artistically arranged by %0aNature ; while others, again, suppose that they are produced %0afrom an intercourse with the one which is to be found in every %0aGwarm, and is usually called the king. This one, they say, is %0athe only male** in the hive, and is endowed with such ex- %0atraordinarj' proportions, that it may not become exhausted %0ain the performance of its duties. Hence it is, that no off- %0aspring can be produced without it, all the other bees being %0afemales,*' and attending it in its capacity of a male, and not %0aas their leader. This opinion, however, which is otherwise %0anot improbable, is sufficiently refuted by the generation of the %0adrones. For on what grounds could it possibly happen that %0athe same intercourse should produce an offspring part of which %0ais perfect, and part in an imperfect state ? The first surmise %0awhich I have mentioned would appear, indeed, to be much %0anearer the truth, were it not the case that here another diffi- %0aculty meets us — the circumstance that sometimes, at the ex- %0atremity of the combs, there are produced bees of a larger size, %0awhich put the others to flight. This noxious bee bears the %0aname of oestrus, and how is it possible that it should ever be %0aproduced, if it is the fact that the bees themselves form their %0aprogeny %0a%0aA fact, however, that is well ascertained, is, that bees sit,"' %0alike the domestic fowl, that which is hatched by them at %0a%0a^ " TJnsmoked " honoy. %0a%0aIt takes place while they are on the wing. %0aThe only prolific /cma^, in reality. %0a^5 Some nnprolific females and some males, in reality. %0a50 Cuvier thinks that either hornets, or else the drones, must be alluded %0ato.

If a per- %0ason takes off the head of either kind before the wings are %0aformed, the rest of the body is considered a most choice morsel %0aby the parents. In process of time the parent bees instil %0anutriment into them, and sit upon them, making on this occa- %0asion a loud humming noise, for the purpose, it is generally %0asupposed, of generating that warmth which is so requisite for %0ahatching the young. At length the membrane in which each %0aof them is enveloped, as though it lay in an egg, bursts asunder, %0aand the whole swarm comes to light. %0a%0aThis circumstance was witnessed at the suburban retreat of %0aa man of consular dignity near Rome, whose hives were made %0aof transparent lantern horn : the young were found to be deve- %0aloped in the space of forty-five days. In some combs, there is %0afound Avhat is known by the name of " nail" wax it is bitter %0aand hard, and is only met with when the bees have failed to %0ahatch their young, either from disease or a natural sterility, %0ait is the abortion, in fact, of the bees.

(17.) THE MODE OF GOVERNMENT OF THE BEES. %0a%0aLet a man employ himself, forsooth, in the enquiry whether %0athere has been only one Hercules, how many fathers Liber %0athere have been, and all the other questions which are buried %0adeep in the mould of antiquity .' Here behold a tiny object, %0aone to be met with at most of our country retreats, and num- %0abers of which are always at hand, and yet, after all, it is not %0aagreed among authors whether or not the king'^ is the only one %0aamong them that is provided with no sting, and is possessed %0aof no other arms than those afforded him by his majestic office, %0aor whether, Nature has granted him a sting, and has only denied %0ahim the power of making use of it ; it being a well-knowu %0afact, that the ruling bee never does use a sting. The obedi- %0aence which his subjects manifest in his presence is quite sur- %0aprising. When he goes forth, the whole swarm attends him, %0athrongs about him, surrounds him, protects him, and will not %0aallow him to be seen. At other times, when the swarm is at %0awork within, the king is seen to visit the works, and appears %0ato be giving his encouragement, being himself the only one %0athat is exempt from work : around him are certain other bees %0awhich act as' body-guards and lictors, the careful guardians of %0ahis authority. The king never quits tlie hive except when the %0aswarm is about to depart ; a thing which may be known a long %0atime beforehand, as for some days a peculiar buzzing noise %0ais to be heard within, which denotes that the bees are waiting %0afor a favourable day, and making all due preparations for their %0adeparture. On such an occasion, if care is taken to deprive the %0aking of one of his wings, the swarm will not fiy away. When %0athey are on the wing, everyone is anxious to be near him, and %0atakes a pleasure in being seen in the performance of its duty. %0aWhen he is weary, they support him on their shoulders ; and %0a%0a58 The greater size of the abdomen makes the wings look shorter. %0a%0a59 The queen has a sting, like the working bees, but uses it less fre- %0aquently. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 18 ] OMENS AFFOEDED BY A SWARM OF BEES. 19 %0a%0a%0a%0awhen he is quite tired, they carry him outright.

H.vrPY OMENS SOMETIMES AFFOEDED BY A SWAKM %0a%0aOF BEES. %0a%0aAnd then, too, it is that they afford presages both of private %0aand public interest, clustering, as they do, like a bunch of %0agrapes, upon houses or temples ; presages, in fact, that are often %0aaccounted for by great events. Bees settled upon the lips of %0aPlato when still an infant even, announcing thereby the sweet- %0aness of that persuasive eloquence for which he was so noted. %0aBees settled, too, in the camp of the chieftain Drusus when, %0ahe gained the brilliant victory at Arbalo f° a proof, indeed, %0athat the conjectures of soothsayers are not hy any means in- %0afallible, seeing that they are of opinion that this is always of %0aevil augmy. AVhen their leader is withheld from them, the %0aswarm can always be detained ; and when lost, it will disperse %0aand take its departure to find other kings. Without a king, %0ain fact, thej^ cannot exist, and it is with the greatest reluct- %0aance that they put them to death when there are several ; they %0a2)refer, too, to destroy the cells of the j'oung ones, if they find %0areason to despair of providing food ; in such case they then %0aexpel the drones. And yet, with regard to the last, I find that %0asome doubts are entertained ; and that there are some authors %0awho are of opinion that they form a peculiar species, like that %0abee, the very largest among them all, which is known by the %0aname of the " thief,'"*^ because it furtively devours the honey ; %0ait is distinguished by its black colour and the largeness of its %0abody. It is a well-known fact, however, that the bees are in %0athe habit of killing the drones. These last have no king of %0atheir own ; but how it is that they are produced without a %0asting, is a matter still undetermined. %0a%0aIn a wet spring the young swarms are more numerous ; in %0aa dry one the honey is most abundant.

The swarm that is thus attacked, at once %0aranges itself in battle array, and if the bee-keeper should %0ahappen to be present, that side which perceives itself favoured %0aby him will reti-ain from attacking him. They often fight, %0atoo, for other reasons as well, and the two generals are to be %0aseen drawing up their ranks in battle array against their op- %0aponents. The dispute generally arises in culling from the %0aflowers, when each, the moment that it is in danger, summons %0aits companions to its aid. The battle, however, is immediately %0aput an end to by throwing dust*^- among them, or raising a %0asmoke ; and if milk or honey mixed with water is placed be- %0afore them, they speedily become reconciled. %0a%0aCHAP. 19. (18.) THE VARIOUS KINDS OF BEES. %0a%0aThere are field bees also, and wild bees, ungainly in appear- %0aance, and much more irascible than the others, but remarkable %0afor their laboriousness and the excellence of their work. Of %0adomestic bees there are two sorts ; the best are those with %0ashort bodies, speckled all over, and of a compact round shape. %0aThose that are long, and resemble the wasp in appearance, %0aare an inferior kind ; and of these last, the very worst of all %0aare those which have the body covered with hair. In Pontus %0athere is a kind of white bee, which makes honey twice a %0amonth. On the banks of the river Thermodon there are %0atwo kinds found, one of which makes honey in the trees, the %0aother under ground : they form a triple row of combs, and %0aproduce honey in the greatest abundance. %0a%0aNature has provided bees with a sting, which is inserted in %0athe abdomen of the insect. There are some who think that %0aat the first blow which they inflict with this weapon they will %0ainstantly die,^' while others, again, are of opinion that such is %0anot the case, unless the animal drives it so deep as to cause %0aa portion of the intestines to follow ; and they assert, also, %0athat after they have thus lost their sting they become drones," %0a%0a8- So Virgil says — %0a%0a■ " Haec certamina tanta %0a%0aPulveris exigui jactu compressa quiescent." — Georg. iv. 87. %0aIf it is left in the wound, the insect dies, being torn asunder %0a«i Of course this is fabulous, as the drones are males. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 20.] %0a%0a%0a%0aTHE DISEASES OF BEES. %0a%0a%0a%0a21 %0a%0a%0a%0aand make no honey, being thus castrated, so to say, and %0aequally incapable of inflicting injury, and of making themselves %0auseful by their labours. We have instances stated of horses %0abeing killed by bees. %0a%0aThey have a great aversion to bad smells, and fly away %0afrom them ; a dislike which extends to artificial perfumes %0aeven. Hence it is that they will attack persons who smell %0aof unguents. They themselves, also, are exposed to the %0aattacks of wasps and hornets, which belong to the same class, %0abut are of a degenerate^ nature ; these wage continual warfare %0aagainst them, as also does a species of gnat, which is known %0aby the name of " mulio;""® swallows, too, and various other %0abirds prey upon them. Frogs lie in wait for them when in %0aquest of water, which, in fact, is their principal occupation %0aat the time they are rearing their young. And it is not only %0athe frog that frequents ponds and streams that is thus injuri- %0aous to them, but the bramble-frog as well, which will come %0ato the hives even in search of them, and, crawling up to the %0aentrance, breathe through the apertures ; upon hearing which, a %0abee flies to the spot, and is snapped up in an instant. It is %0agenerally stated that frogs are proof against the sting of the %0abee. Sheep, too, are peculiarly dangerous to them, as they %0ahave the greatest difficulty in extricating themselves from %0athe fleece. The smell of crabs,®' if they happen to be cooked in %0atheir vicinity, is fatal to them. %0a%0aCHAP. 20. — THE DISEASES OF BEES. %0a%0aBees are also by nature liable to certain diseases of their %0aown. The sign that they are diseased, is a kind of torpid, %0amoping sadness : on such occasions, they are to be seen bring- %0aing out those that are sick before the hives, and placing them %0ain the warm sun, while others, again, are providing them with %0afood. Those that are dead they carry away from the hive, %0aand attend the bodies, pajdng their last duties, as it were, in %0afuneral procession. If the king should happen to be carried %0aoff by the pestilence, the swarm remains plunged in grief and %0alistless inactivity ; it collects no more food, and ceases to issue %0a%0a^ Though belonging to the same class, they are not of degenerate kinds. %0a60 The "mule-gnat." %0a%0aSee Virgil, Georg.

Indeed, %0aif due care is not taken to come to their aid, they will die of %0ahunger. It is from their cheerfulness, in fact, and their %0abright and sleek appearance that we usually form an estimate %0aas to their health. %0a%0a(19) There are certain maladies, also, which affect their %0aproductions ; when they do not fill their combs, the disease %0aunder which they are labouring is known by the name of %0aclaros,^^ and if they fail to rear their young, they are suffering %0afrom the effects of that kno-^oi as llapsigonia.^^ %0a%0aCHAP. 21. THII^GS THAT ARE NOXIOUS TO BEES. %0a%0aEcho, or the noise made by the reverberation of the air, %0ais also injurious to bees, as it dismays them by its redoubled %0asounds ; fogs, also, are noxious to them. Spiders, too, are espe- %0acially hostile to bees ; when they have gone so far as to build their %0awebs within the hive, the death of the whole swarm is the result. %0aThe common and ignoble moth,™ too, that is to be seen fluttering %0aabout a burning candle, is deadly to them, and that in more %0aways than one. It devours the wax, and leaves its ordure %0abehind it, from which the maggot known to us as the " teredo " %0ais produced ; besides which, wherever it goes, it drops the %0adown from off its wings, and thereby thickens the threads of %0athe cobwebs. The teredo is also engendered in the wood of %0athe hive, and then it proves especially destructive to the wax. %0aBees are the victims, also, of their own greediness, for when %0athey glut themselves overmuch with the juices of the flowers, in %0athe spring season more particularly, they are troubled with %0aflux and looseness. Olive oil is fatal'* to not only bees, but %0aall other insects as well, and more especially if they are placed %0a%0aThe reading seems doubtful, and the meaning is probably unknown. %0a" Injury of the young." %0a%0aTliere are two kinds of hive-moth — the Phalsena tinea mcllanella of %0aLinnaeus, and the Phalrena tortrix cereana.

Some- %0atimes, too, the)- themselves are the cause of their own de- %0astruction ; as, for instance, when they see preparations being %0amade for taking their honey, and immediately full to de- %0avouring it with the greatest avidity. In other respects they are %0aremarkable for their abstemiousness, and they will expel %0athose that are inclined to be prodigal and voracious, no less than %0athose that are sluggish and idle. Their own honey even may %0abe productive of injury to them ; for if they are smeared with %0ait on the fore-part of the body, it is fatal to them. Such ai'e %0atlie enemies, so numerous are the accidents — and how small a %0aportion of them have I here enumerated ! — to Avhich a crea- %0ature that proves so bountiful to us is exposed.

(20.) — HOW TO KEEP BEES TO THE HIVE. %0a%0aThe clapping of the hands and the tinkling of brass afford %0abees great delight, and it is by these means that they are %0abrought together ; a strong proof, in fact, that they are pos- %0asessed of the sense of hearing. When their work is com- %0apleted, their offspring brought forth, and all their duties ful- %0afilled, they still have certain formal exercises to perform, ranging %0aabroad throughout the country, and soaring aloft in the air, %0awheeling round and round as they fly, and then, when the %0ahour for taking their food has come, returning home. The %0aextreme period of their life, supposing that they escape acci- %0adent and the attacks of their enemies, is onlj' seven years ; %0aa hive, it is said, never lasts more than ten." There are some %0apersons, who think that, when dead, if they are preserved %0ain the house throughout the winter, and then exposed to the %0awarmth of the spring sun, and kept hot all day in the ashes %0aof fig-tree wood, they will come to life again. %0a%0aCnAP. 23.

But in all these last, sexual intercourse %0ais to be perceived as well, though the characteristics of the %0aoftspring are pretty much the same as those of the bee. %0a%0aCHAT. 24. (21.) WASPS AND HORNETS : ANIMALS WHICK APPEO- %0a%0aPKIATE WHAT BELONGS TO OTHERS. %0a%0a"Wasps build their nests of mud in lofty places," and make %0awax therein : hornets, on the other hand, build in holes or %0aunder ground. With these two kinds the cells are also hex- %0aagonal, but, in other respects, though made of the bark of trees, %0atbey strongly resemble the substance of a spider's web. Their %0ayoung also are found at irregular intervals, and are of un- %0ashapely appearance ; while one is able to fly, another is still a %0amere pupa, and a third only in the maggot state. It is in %0athe autumn, too, and not in the spring, that all their young are %0aproduced; and they grow during the full moon more pai'- %0aticularly. The wasp which is known as the ichneumon," a %0asmaller kind than the others, kills one kind of spider in parti- %0acular, known as the phalangium ; after which it carries the %0abody to its nest, covers it over with a sort of gluey substance, %0aand then sits and hatches from it its young.''* In addi- %0ation to this, they are all of them carnivorous, while on the %0aother hand bees will touch no animal substance whatever. %0aWasps more particularly pursue the larger flies, and after %0acatching them cut off the head and carry away the remaining %0aportion of the body. %0a%0aWild hornets live in the holes of trees, and in winter, like %0aother insects, keep themselves concealed ; their life does not %0aexceed two years in length. It is not unfrequently that their %0asting is productive of an attack of fever, and there are authors %0awho say that thrice nine stings will suffice to kiU a man. Of %0a%0aGeorg.

In spring they build %0atheir nests, which have generally four entrances, and here it is %0athat the working hornets are produced : after these have been %0ahatched they form other nests of larger size, in which to bring %0aforth the parents of the future generation. From this time %0athe working hornets begin to follow their vocation, and apply %0athemselves to supplying the others with food. The parent %0ahornets are of larger size than the others, and it is very doubt- %0aful whether they have a sting, as it is never to be seen %0aprotruded. These races, too, have their drones. Some persons %0aare of opinion that all these insects lose their stings in the %0awinter. Neither hornets nor wasps have a king, nor do they %0aever congregate in swarms ; but their numbers are recruited by %0afresh offspring from time to time. %0a%0aCHAP. 25. (22.) THE BOMBTX OF ASSYEIA. %0a%0aA fourth class of this kind®" of insect is the bombyx,^' which %0ais a native of AssjTia, and is of larger size than any of those %0awhich have been previously mentioned. They construct their %0anests of a kind of mud which has the appearance of salt, and %0athen fasten them to a stone, where they become so hard, that %0ait is scarcely possible to penetrate them with a dart even. %0aIn these nests they make wax, in larger quantities than bees, %0aand the grub which they then produce is larger. %0a%0aCHAP. 26. — THE LAEV^ OF THE SILK-WOEM — WHO FIEST INVENTED %0aSILK CLOTHS. %0a%0aThere is another class also of these insects produced in quite %0aa diflferent manner. These last spring from a grub of larger %0asize, with two horns of very peculiar appearance. The %0alarva then becomes a caterpillar, after which it assumes the %0astate in which it is known as homhylis, then that called necy- %0adalm, and after that, in six months, it becomes a silk-worm." %0a%0aCuvier says that it is the males, and not the females, that have no sting. %0a%0aWhat modern naturalists call the " Hymenoptera." %0a*' Some kind of wasp, or, as Cuvier says, probably the mason bee. %0a^ Called "bombyx" also; though, as Cuvier remarks, of a kind al- %0atogether different from the preceding one. %0a%0a%0a%0a26 %0a%0a%0a%0aFlint's natural history. %0a%0a%0a%0a[Book XI. %0a%0a%0a%0aThese insects weave webs similar to those of the spider, the %0amaterial of which is used for making the more costly and %0aluxurious garments of females, known as " bombycina.

At first they assume the %0aappearance of small butterflies with naked bodies, but soon %0aafter, being unable to endure the cold, they throw out bristly %0ahairs, and assume quite a thick coat against the winter, by %0arubbing off the down that covers the leaves, by the aid of %0athe roughness of their feet. This they compress into balls %0aby carding it with their claws, and then draw it out and %0ahang it between the branches of the trees, making it fine %0aby combing it out as it were : last of all, they take and roll it %0around their body, thus forming a nest in which they are enve- %0aloped. It is in this state that they are taken ; after which %0athey are placed in earthen vessels in a warm place, and fed %0aupon bran. A peculiar sort of down soon shoots forth upon %0athe body, on being clothed with which they are sent to work %0aupon another task. The cocoons®^ which they have begun to %0at'orm are rendered soft and pliable by the aid of water, and %0aare then drawn out into threads by means of a spindle made of %0aa reed. Nor, in fact, have the men even felt ashamed to make %0ause^ of garments formed of this material, in consequence of %0a%0a83 The first kinds of silk dresses worn by the Eoman ladies were from %0athis island, and, as Pliny says, were known by the name of Cocs vestcs. %0aThese dresses were so fine as to be transparent, and were sometimes dyed %0apurple, and enriched with stripes of gold. They probably had their name %0afrom the early reputation which Cos acquired by its manufactures of silk. %0aThis account is derived from Aristotle, Hist. Anim.

(24.) — spiDEES; the kinds that make webs; the %0a%0aMATERIALS USED BY THEM IN SO DOING. %0a%0aIt is by no means an absurdity to append to the silk-worm %0aan account of the spider, a creature which is worthy of our %0aespecial admiration. There arc numerous kinds of spiders, how- %0aever, which it will not be necessary here to mention, from the %0afact of their being so well known. Those that bear the name %0aoi phalangium are of small size, with bodies spotted and run- %0aning to a point ; their bite is venomous, and they leap as they %0amove from place to place. Another kind, again, is black, and %0athe fore-legs are remarkable for their length. Thej^ have all of %0athem three joints in the legs. The smaller kind of wolf-spider*' %0adoes not make a web, but the larger ones make their holes in %0athe earth, and spread their nets at the narrow entrance thereof. %0aA third kind, again, is remarkable for the skill which it dis- %0aplays in its operations. These spin a large web, and the ab- %0adomen suffices to supply the material for so extensive a work, %0awhether it is that, at stated periods the excrements are largely %0asecreted in the abdomen, as Democritus thinks, or that the %0acreature has in itself a certain faculty of secreting®* a peculiar %0asort of woolly substance. How steadily does it work with its %0aclaws, how beautifully rounded and how equal are the threads %0aas it forms its web, while it employs the weight of its body as %0aan equipoise ! It begins at the middle to weave its web, and %0athen extends it by adding the threads in rings around, like a %0awarp upon the woof : forming the meshes at equal intervals, %0abut continually enlarging them as the web increases in breadth, %0ait finally unites them all by an indissoluble knot. "With what %0awondrous art does it conceal the snares that lie in wait %0afor its prey in its checkered nettings ! How little, too, woidd %0ait seem that there is any such trap laid in the compactness of %0a%0aenacted " ne vestis Serica viros faedaret" — " That men should not defile %0athemselves by wearing garments of silk," Ann.

How loose, too, is the body of the web %0aas it yields to the blasts, and how readily does it catch all objects %0awhich come in its way ! You Avould fancy that it had left, %0aquite exhausted, the thrums of the upper portion of its net %0aunfinished where they are spread across ; it is with the great- %0aest difficulty that they are to be perceived, and yet the moment %0athat an object touches them, like the lines of the hunter's net, %0athey throw it into the body of the web. With what archi- %0atectural skill, too, is its hole arched over, and how well de- %0afended by a nap of extra thickness against the cold ! How %0acarefully, too, it retires into a corner, and appears intent upon %0aanything but what it really is, all the while that it is so care- %0afully shut up from view, that it is impossible to perceive whe- %0ather there is anything within or not I And then too, how ex- %0atraordinary the strength of the web ! When is the wind ever %0aknown to break it, or what accumulation of dust is able to %0aweigh it down ? %0a%0aThe spider often spreads its web right across between two %0atrees, when plpng its art and learning how to spin ; and then, %0aas to its length, the thread extends from the very top of the %0atree to the ground, while the insect springs up again in an %0ainstant from the earth, and travels aloft by the very self-same %0athread, thus mounting at the same moment and spinning %0aits threads. When its prey falls into its net, how on the alert %0ait is, and with what readiness it runs to seize it ! Even %0athough it should be adhering to the very edge of its web, the %0ainsect always runs instantly to the middle, as it is by these %0ameans that it can most effectually shake the web, and so suc- %0acessfully entangle its prey. When the web is torn, the %0aspider immediately sets about repairing it, and that so neatly, %0athat nothing like patching can ever be seen. The spider lies %0ain wait even for the young of the lizard, and after enveloping %0athe head of the animal, bites its lips ; a sight by no means %0aunworthy of the amphitheatre itself, when it is one's good for- %0atune to witness it. Presages also are drawn from the spider ; %0afor when a river is about to swell, it will suspend its web %0ahigher than usual. In calm weather these insects do not spin, %0abut when it is cloudy they do, and hence it is, that a great %0anumber of cobwebs is a sure sign of showery weather. It is %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 30.] %0a%0a%0a%0aSCOEPTONS. %0a%0a%0a%0a29 %0a%0a%0a%0agenerally supposed that it is the female spicier that spins, %0aand the male that lies in wait for prey, thus making an equal %0adivision of their duties. %0a%0aCHAP. 29. THE GENEEATION OF SPIDEES. %0a%0aSpiders couple®^ backwards, and produce maggots like eggs ; %0afor I ought not to defer making some mention of this subject, %0aseeing, in fact, that of most insects there is hardly anything %0aelse to be said. All these eggs they lay in their webs, but %0ascattered about, as they leap from place to place while laying %0athem. The phalangium is the only spider that lays a con- %0asiderable number of them, in a hole ; and as soon as ever %0athe progeny is hatched it devours its mother, and very often %0athe male parent as well, for that, too, aids in the process of %0aincubation. These last produce as many as three hundred %0aeggs, the others a smaller number. Spiders take three days %0ato hatch their eggs. They come to their full growth in %0atwenty-eight days. %0a%0aCHAP. 30. (25.) — SCOEPIONS. %0a%0aIn a similar manner to the spider, the land scorpion also pro- %0aduces maggots^ similar to eggs, and dies in a similar manner. %0aThis animal is a dangerous scourge, and has a venom like that %0aof the serpent ; with the exception that its effects are far %0amore"^ painful, as the person who is stung will linger for %0athree days before death ensues. The sting is invariably %0afatal to virgins, and nearly always so to matrons. It is so %0ato men also, in the morning, when the animal has issued from %0aits hole in a fasting state, and has not yet happened to dis- %0acharge its poison by any accidental stroke. The tail is always %0aready to strike, and ceases not for an instant to menace, so %0athat no opportunity may possibly be missed. The animal %0astrikes too with a sidelong blow, or else by turning the tail %0a%0aThey copulate in a manner dissimilar to that of any other insects — %0athe male fecundates the female by the aid of feelers, which he introduces %0ainto the vulva of the female situate beneath the anterior part of the %0aabdomen. %0a%0aCuvier remarks, that the scorpion is viviparous ; but the young are %0a■white when born, and wrapped up in an oval mass, for which reason they %0amay easily be taken for maggots or grubs. %0a%0a9' This must be understood of the scorpion of Egypt, Libya, and Syria. %0aThe sting of that of the south of Europe is not generally dangerous. %0a%0a%0a%0a30 %0a%0a%0a%0aPLINT'8 NATtJKAL ITISTOET. %0a%0a%0a%0a[Book XI. %0a%0a%0a%0aupwards. Apollodorus informs us, that the poison which %0athey secrete is of a white colour, and he has divided them into %0anine classes, distinguished mostly hy their colours — to very %0alittle purpose, however, for it is impossible to understand %0awhich among these it is that he has pronounced to be the %0aleast dangerous. He says, also, that some of them have a %0adouble sting, and that the males — for he asserts that they are %0aengendered by the union of the sexes — are the most dangerous. %0aThese may easily be known, he says, by their slender form %0aand greater length. He states, also, that they all of them have %0avenom in the middle of the day, when they have been warmed %0aby the heat of the sun, as, also, when they are thirsty — their %0athirst, indeed, can never be quenched. It is an ascertained %0afact, that those which have seven joints in the tail are the %0amost"^ deadly ; the greater part, however, have but six. %0a%0aFor this pest of Africa, the southern winds have provided %0ameans of flight as well, for as the breeze bears them along, %0athey extend their arms and ply them like so many oars iu %0atheir flight ; the same Apollodorus, however, asserts that there %0aare some which really have wings. The Ps5'lli, who for their %0aown profit have been in the habit of importing the poisons of %0aother lands among us, and have thus filled Italy with the pests %0aAvhich belong to other regions, have made attempts to import %0athe flying scorpion as well, but it. has been found that it %0acannot live further north than the latitude of Sicily. How- %0aever, they^'' are sometimes to be seen in Italy, but are quite %0aharmless there ; they are found, also, in many other places, tlie %0avicinity of Pharos, in Egypt, for instance. In Scythia, the %0ascorpion is able to kill the swine even with its sting, an animal %0awhich, in general, is proof against poisons of this kind in a %0aremarkable degree. 'When stung, those swine which are black %0adie more speedily than others, and more particularly if they %0ahappen to throw themselves into the water. When a person %0ahas been stung, it is generally supposed that he may be cured %0aby drinking the ashes of the scorpion"^ mixed with wine. It %0a%0a92 Cuvier seems to regard this as fanciful : he says that the instances of %0aseven joints are but rarely to be met mtb. %0a%0a93 There are no winged scorpions. Cuvier thinks that he may possibly %0aallude to the panorpis, or scorpion-fly, the abdomen of which terminates %0ain a forceps, which resembles the tail of the scorpion. %0a%0a9* Probably the panorpis. %0a95 See B. xxk. c. 29. %0a%0a%0a%0aC'linp. 32.] %0a%0a%0a%0aTHE GRASSnorPER. %0a%0a%0a%0a31 %0a%0a%0a%0ais the belief also that there is nothing more baneful to the %0ascorpion and the stellio,*' than to dip them in oil. This last %0aanimal is also dangerous to all other creatures, except those %0awhich, like itself, are destitute of blood : in figure it strongi}- %0aresemblcs the common lizard. For the most part, also, %0athe scorpion does no injiiry to any animal which is bloodless. %0aSome writers, too, are of opinion that the scorpion devours its %0aoffspring, and that the one among the young which is the most %0aadroit avails itself of its sole mode of escape, by placing itself %0aon the back of the mother, and thus finding a place where it %0ais in safety from the tail and the sting. The one that thus %0aescapes, they say, becomes the avenger of the rest, and at last, %0ataking advantage of its elevated position, puts its parents to %0adeath. The scorpion produces eleven at a birth. %0a%0aCHAP, 31.

The smaller kind are born the first and die %0athe last, and are without a voice. The others are of the flying %0akind, and have a note ; there are two sorts, those known as %0aacheta, and the smaller ones called tettigonia : these last have %0athe loudest voice. In both of these last-mentioned kinds, it is %0athe male that sings, while the female is silent. There are na- %0ations in the east that feed upon these insects, the Parthians %0a%0a9s The starred or spotted lizard. %0a%0a" The stellio of the Romans is the " ascalabos " or " ascalabotes " of %0athe Greeks, the lizard into which Ascalabus was changed by Ceres : see %0aOvid, Met. B. v. 1. 450, et scq. Pliny also mentions this in B. xxix. c. 4, %0athough he speaks of some difference in their appearance. It is a species %0aof gecko, the tarentola of Italy, the tarentc of Provence, and the geckotta, %0aprobably, of Lacepede. The gecko, Cuvier says, is not venomous ; but it %0acauses small blisters to rise on the skin when it walks over it, the result, %0aprobably, of the extreme sharpness of its nails. %0a%0a^ See c. 28 of this l^ook, and P.. viii. c. 95 ; P. xxx. c. 27. %0a%0a9» A general name for the grasshopper.

Upon the back they have %0aa sharp-edged instrument,^ by means of which they excavate %0aa hole to breed in, in the ground. The young is, at first, %0aa small maggot in appearance, after which the larva assumes %0athe form in which it is known as the tettiijoynetra? It bursts %0aits shell about the time of the summer solstice, and then takes %0ato flight, which always happens in the night. The insect, %0aat first, is black and hard. %0a%0aThis is the only living creature that has no mouth ; though %0ait has something instead which bears a strong resemblance to %0athe tongues of those insects which carry a sting in the mouth : %0athis organ is situate in the breast^ of the animal, and is em- %0aployed by it in sucking up the dew. The corselet itself forms a %0akind of pipe ; and it is by means of this that the achetae utter %0atheir note, as already mentioned. Beyond this, they have %0ano viscera in the abdomen. When surprised, they spring %0aupwards, and eject a kind of liquid, which, indeed, is our %0aonly proof that they live upon dew. This, also, is the only %0aanimal that has no outlet for the evacuations of the body. %0aTheir powers of sight are so bad, that if a person contracts %0ahis finger, and then suddenly extends it close to them, they %0awill come upon it just as though it were a leaf. Some authors %0adivide these animals into two kinds, the " surcularia,"* which %0ais the largest, and the " frumentaria,"" by many known as the %0a" avenaria;'" this last makes its appearance just as the corn is %0aturning dry in the ear. %0a%0a(27.)

In the territory of Ehegium, %0aagain, none of the grasshoppers have any note, while be- %0ayond the river, in the territory of Locri,^ they sing aloud. %0aTheir wings are formed similarly to those of bees, but are %0alarger, in proportion to the body. %0a%0aCHAP. 33, (28.) — THE WIKGS OF INSECTS.* %0a%0aThere are some insects M'hich have two wings, flies, for %0ainstance ; others, again, have four, like the bee. The wings %0aof the grasshopper are membranous. Those insects which are %0aarmed with a sting in the abdomen, have four wings. None %0aof those which have a sting in the mouth, have more than %0atwo wings. The former have received the sting for the pur- %0apose of defending themselves, the latter for the supplying of %0atheir wants. If pulled from off the body, the wings of an %0ainsect will not grow again ; no insect which has a sting in-- %0aserted in its body, has two wings only. %0a%0aCHAP. 34. — THE BEETLE. THE GLOW-WORM.

There is another kind^- of beetle, again, which, %0aas it goes backwards with its feet, rolls the dung into large %0apellets, and then deposits in them the maggots which form its %0ayoung, as in a sort of nest, to protect them against the rigours %0aof winter. Some, again, fly with a loud buzzing or a drony %0anoise, while others burrow numerous holes in the hearths %0aand out in the fields, and their shrill chirrup is to be heard at %0anight. %0a%0aThe glow-worm, by the aid of the colour of its sides " and %0ahaunches, sends forth at night a light which resembles that of %0afire; being resplendent, at one moment, as it expands its %0awings,'* and then thrown into the shade the instant it has %0ashut them. These insects are never to be seen before the grass %0aof the pastures has come to maturity, nor yet after the hay has %0abeen cut. On the other hand, it is the nature of the black %0abeetle'® to seek dark corners, and to avoid the light : it is %0amostly found in baths, being produced from the humid vapours %0aAvhich arise therefrom. There are some beetles also, belonging %0ato the same species, of a golden colour and very large size, which %0aburrow " in dry ground, and construct small combs of a porous %0anature, and very like sponge ; these they fill with a poisonous %0akind of honey. In Thrace, near Olynthus, there is a small %0alocality, the only one in which this animal cannot exist; %0afrom which circumstance it has received the name of " Can- %0atharolethus."

All these insects have their stings situate in the mouth %0ainstead of a tongue ; but in some the sting is not pointed, %0abeing formed not for pricking, but for the purpose of suction : %0athis is the case more especially with flies, in which it is clear %0athat the tongue is nothing more than a tube. These insects, %0atoo, have no teeth. Others, again, have little horns pro- %0atruding in front of the eyes, but without any power in them ; %0athe butterfly, for instance. Some insects are destitute of wings, %0asuch as the scolopendra, for instance.^' %0a%0aCHAP. 35. LOCTTSTS. %0a%0aThose insects which have feet, move sideways. Some of %0athem have the hind feet longer than the fore ones, and curving %0aoutwards, the locust, for example. %0a%0a(29.) These creatures lay their eggs in large masses, in the %0aautumn, thrusting the end of the tail into holes which they %0aform in the ground. These eggs remain underground %0athroughout the winter, and in the ensuing year, at the close %0aof spring, small locusts issue from them, of a black colour, and %0acrawling along without legs^ and wings. Hence it is that a %0awet spring destroys their eggs, while, if it is dry, they mul- %0atiply in great abundance. Some persons maintain that they %0abreed twice a year, and die the same number of times ; that %0athey bring forth at the rising^^ of the Vergilise, and die at %0athe rising of the Dog-star,^'' after which others spring up in %0a%0aCuvier remarks, that the panorpis has a tail very like that of the scor- %0apion ; and that the ephemera, the ichneumons and others, have tails also. %0aAristotle, in the corresponding place, only says that the insects do not use %0athe tail to direct their flight. %0a*i These are merely the feelers of the jaws. %0a%0a*2 Not instead of, but in addition to, the tongue, by the aid of which %0athey suck. %0a^ Evidently meaning the trunk. %0a2* See B. xxix. c. 39. %0a%0aIt is not true that the young locusts are destitute of feet. %0a26 7th May.

In %0aIndia, it is said that they attain the length of three feet, and %0athat the people dry the legs and thighs, and use them for saws. %0aThere is another mode, also, in which these creatures perish ; %0athe winds carry them off in vast swarms, upon which they fall %0ainto the sea or standing waters, and not, as the ancients sup- %0aposed, because their wings have been drenched by the damp- %0aness of the night. The same authors have also stated, that %0athey are unable to fly during the night, in consequence of the %0acold, being ignorant of the fact, that they travel over lengthened %0atracts of sea for many days together, a thing the more to be won- %0adered they have to endure hunger all the time as well, for %0athis it is which causes them to be thus seeking pastures in other %0alands. This is looked upon as a plague^^ inflicted by the anger %0aof the gods ; for as they fly they appear to be larger than they %0areally are, while they make such a loud noise with their wings, %0athat they might be readily supposed to be winged creatures of %0aquite anoth^ species. Their numbers, too, are so vast, that they %0aquite darken the sun ; while the people below are anxiously %0afollowing them with the eye, to see if they are about to make %0aa descent, and so cover their lands. After all, they have %0athe requisite energies for their flight ; and, as though it had %0abeen but a trifling matter to pass over the seas, they cross im- %0amense tracts of country, and cover them in clouds which bode %0adestruction to the harvests. Scorching numerous objects by %0atheir very contact, they eat away everything with their teeth, %0athe very doors of the houses even. %0a%0a25 nth May. %0a%0aCuvier treats this story as purely imaginary. %0a30 Cuvier says that some have been known nearly a foot long, but not %0amore. %0a%0a3' He alludes to the ravages committed bv the swarms of the migratory %0alocust, Grillus migratorius of Linnaeus. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 36.] ANTS. 37 %0a%0aThose from Africa are the ones which chiefly devastate %0aItaly ; and more than once the Roman people have been obliged %0ato have recourse to the Sibylline Books, to learn what remedies %0ato employ under their existing apprehensions of impending %0afomine. In the territory of Cyrenaica^'^ there is a law, which %0aeven compels the people to make war, three times a year, %0aagainst the locusts, first, by crushing their eggs, next by kill- %0aing the young, and last of all by killing those of full growth ; %0aand he who fails to do so, incurs the penalty of being treated %0aas a deserter. In the island of Lemnos also, there is a certain %0ameasure fixed by law, which each individual is bound to fill %0awith locusts which he has killed, and then bring it to the %0amagistrates. It is for this reason, too, that they pay such respect %0ato the jack-daw, which flies to meet the locusts, and kills them %0ain great numbers. In Syria, also, the people are placed under %0amartial law, and compelled to kill them : in so many countries %0adocs this dreadful pest prevail. The Parthians look upon %0athem as a choice food,^* and the grasshopper as weU. The voice %0aof tlie locust appears to proceed from the back part of the head. %0aIt is generally believed that in this place, where the shoidders %0ajoin on to the body, they have, as it were, a kind of teeth, and %0athat it is by grinding these against each other that they pro- %0aduce the harsh noise which they make. It is more especially %0aabout the two equinoxes that they are to be heard, in the %0asame way that we hear the chirrup of the grasshopper about %0athe summer solstice. The coupling of locusts is similar to %0athat of all other insects that couple, the female supporting %0athe male, and turning back the extremity of the tail towards %0ahim ; it is only after a considerable time that they separate. %0aIn ail these kinds of insects the male is of smaller size than %0athe female. %0a%0aCHAP. 36.

These burdens they %0acarry with the mouth, but when it is too large to admit of %0athat, they turn their backs to it, and push it onwards with %0atheir feet, while they use their utmost energies with their shoul- %0aders. These insects, also, have a political community among %0athemselves, and are possessed of both memory and foresight. %0aThey gnaw each grain before they lay it by, for fear lest it I %0ashould shoot while under ground ; those grains, again, which %0aare too large for admission, they divide at the entrance of their %0aholes ; and those which have become soaked by the rain, they %0abring out and dry.^® They work, too, by night, during the %0afull moon ; but when there is no moon, they cease working. %0aAnd then, too, in their labours, what ardour they display, %0awhat wondrous carefulness ! Because they collect their stores %0afrom different quarters, in ignorance of the proceedings of one %0aanother, they have certain days set apart for holding a kind of %0amarket, on which they meet together and take stock.^' What vast %0athrongs are then to be seen hurrying together, what anxious %0aenquiries appear to be made, and what earnest parleys^ are %0agoing on among them as they meet ! We see even the very %0astones worn away by their footsteps, and roads beaten down %0aby being the scene of their labours. Let no one be in doubt, %0athen, how much assiduity and application, even in the very %0ahumblest of objects, can upon every occasion effect !

This ant excavates gold from holes, %0ain a country in the north of India, the inhabitants of which are %0aknown as the Dard®. It has the colour of a cat, and is in %0asize as large as an Egyptian wolf.*° This gold, which it ex- %0atracts in the winter, is taken by the Indians during the heats %0aof summer, while the ants are compelled, by the excessive %0awarmth, to hide themselves in their holes. Still, however, %0aon being aroused by catching the scent of the Indians, they %0asally forth, and frequently tear them to pieces, though pro- %0avided with the swiftest camels for the purpose of flight ; so %0agreat is their fleetness, combined with their ferocity and their %0apassion for gold ! %0a%0aCHAP. 37. (32.) — THE CHRYSALIS. %0a%0aMany insects, however, ai'e engendered in a different man- %0aner ; and some more especially from dew. This dew settles %0aupon the radish" leaf in the early days of spring ; but when it %0ahas been thickened by the action of the sun, it becomes re- %0aduced to the size of a grain of millet. From this a small grub %0aafterwards arises, which, at the end of three days, becomes %0atransformed into a caterpillar. For several successive days %0ait still increases in size, but remains motionless, and covered %0awith a hard husk. It moves only when touched, and is %0acovered with a web like that of the spider. In this state it %0ais called a chrysalis, but after the husk is broken, it flies forth %0ain the shape of a butterfly. %0a39 See B. V. c. 31. %0a%0a*" M. de Veltheini thinks that by this is really meant the Canis corsac, %0athe small fox of India, but that by some mistake it was represented by %0atravellers as an ant. It is not improbable, Cuvier says, that some quadru- %0aped, in making holes in the ground, may have occasionally thrown up some %0agrains of the precious metal. The story is derived from the narratives %0aof Clearchus and Megasthenes. Another interpretation of this story has %0aalso been suggested. We find from some remarks of Mr. Wilson, in the %0aTransactions of the Asiatic Society, on the Maliabharata, a Sanscrit poem, %0athat various tribes on the mountains Meru and Mandara (supposed to lie %0abetween Hindostan and Tibet) used to sell grains of gold, which they %0aCiAXei paippilaka, or "ant-gold," which, they said, was thrown up by ants, %0ain Sanscrit called pippilaka. In travelling westward, this story, in itself, %0ano doubt, untrue, may very probably have been magnified to its present %0adimensions. %0a%0aCuvier observes, that this is a very correct account of the cabbage %0aor radish butterfly, the Papilio brassicae or Papilio raphani of Linnseua. %0a%0a%0a%0a40 %0a%0a%0a%0aflint's natural histoet. %0a%0a%0a%0a[Book XI. %0a%0a%0a%0aCHAP. 38.

I find it stated, also, by authors, that %0asome kinds of water*' which we use for bathing are more pro- %0aductive of these parasites than others. Even wax is found to %0aproduce mites, which are supposed to be the very smallest of %0aall living creatures. Other insects, again, are engendered %0afrom filth, acted upon by the rays of the sun — these fleas are %0acalled " petauristse,'"'^ from the activity which they display %0ain their hind legs.

THOSE WHICH HAVE %0aItlfTS AND CKESTS. %0a%0aIn addition to what is already stated, we will add an ac- %0acount of every part of the body of an animal, taken limb by limb. %0a%0aAll those which have blood, have a head as well. A small %0anumber of animals, and those only among the birds, have %0atufts of various kinds upon the head. The phoenix^' has a %0along row of feathers on it, from the middle of which arises %0aanother row ; peacocks have a hairy tuft, resembling a bushy %0ashrub ; the stymphalis*" has a sort of pointed crest, and the %0apheasant, again, small horns. Added to these, there is the lark, %0aa little bird, which, from the appearance of its tuft, was %0aformerly called " galerita," but has since received the %0aGallic name of " alauda,"" a name which it has transferred to %0aone of our legions.^^ We have already made mention, also, %0aof one bird*^ to which K^ature has given a crest, which it can %0afold or unfold at pleasure : the birds of the coot kind*'* have %0aalso received from her a crest, which takes its rise at the %0abeak, and runs along the middle of the head ; while the pie %0aof Mars, and the Balearic crane, are furnished with pointed %0atufts. But the most remarkable feature of all, is the crest %0awhich we see attached to the heads of our domestic fowls, %0asubstantial and indented like a saw ; we cannot, in fact, %0astrictly caU it flesh, nor can we pronounce it to be cartilage %0aor a callosity, but must admit that it is something of a nature %0apeculiar to itself. As to the crests of di'agons, there is no one %0ato be found who ever saw one. %0a%0a*^ They only appear to be so, from the peculiar streaks on the eyes. %0aLinnaeus has hence called one variety, the Tabanus caecutiens. %0a%0a'8 Or with pounded chalk or whitening. -Lilian adds, "if they are placed %0ain the sun," which appears necessary for the full success of the experiment. %0aLife appears to be suspended in such cases for a period of surprising length. %0a%0a*^ Probably the golden pheasant, as already mentioned. %0aSome kind of neron or crane, Cuvier thinks. %0a%0a6' The Alauda cristata of Linnseus, so called from " galera," a pointed %0acap like a helmet. %0a%0a62 The fiftb legion. 63 The hoopoe, B. x. c. 44. %0a%0a" Savigny and Cu'^ier take this to be the Ardea virgo of Linnaeus, a %0anative of Numidia. %0a%0a%0a%0a44 %0a%0a%0a%0aFlint's natural iiistoet. %0a%0a%0a%0a[Book XI. %0a%0a%0a%0aCHAP. 45.

In providing ani- %0amals with these weapons, she has made merry at their ex- %0apense ; for some she has spread them out in branches, the %0astag, for instance ; to others she has given them in a more %0asimple form, as in the " subulo," so called from the resem- %0ablance of its horns to a " subula,"*"' or shoemaker's awl. In %0aothers, again, she has flattened them in the shape of a man's %0ahand, with the fingers extended, fi-om which circumstance the %0aanimal has received the name of " platyceros."*' To the roe- %0abuck she has given branching horns, but small, and has made %0athem so as not to fall off and be cast each year ; while to the %0aram she has given them of a contorted and spiral form, as %0athough she were providing it with a caestus for offence. The %0ahorns of the bull, again, are upright and threatening. In this %0alast kind, the females, too, are provided with them, while in %0amost it is only the males. The chamois has them, curving %0abackwards ; while in the fallow deer®® they bend forward. %0aThe strepsiceros,^'" which in Africa bears the name of addax, has %0ahorns erect and spiral, grooved and tapering to a sharp point, %0aso much so, that you would almost take them to be the sides %0aof a lyro.''^* In the oxen of Phrygia, the horns are moveable,'' %0a%0a65 The suddenness of their appearance, no doubt, was fabulous ; but we %0ahave well-authenticated cases in recent times of substances growing on the %0ahuman head, to all appearance resembling horns, and arising from a dis- %0aordered secretion of the hair.

In one kind, also, the horns are used for the purpose %0aof scratching the body, instead of hands. %0a%0aIn snails the horns are fleshy, and are thus adapted for the %0apurpose of feeling the way, which is also the case with the ce- %0arastes ; " some reptiles, again, have only one horn, though the %0asnail has always two, suited for protruding and withdrawing. %0aThe barbarous nations of the north drink from the horns of the %0aurus," a pair of which will hold a couple of um£e other %0atribes, again, point their spears with them.

The horns of all animals are hollow within, %0ait being only at the tip that they are solid : the only excep- %0ation is the stag, the horn of which is solid throughout, and %0ais cast every year. When the hoofs of oxen are worn to the %0aquick, the husbandmen have a method of curing them, by %0aanointing the horns of the animal with grease. The substance %0aof the horns is so ductile, that even while upon the body of %0athe living animal, they can be bent by being steeped in boil- %0aing wax, and if they are split down when they are first shoot- %0aing, they may be twisted different ways, and so appear to be %0a%0a■Ji B. viii.cc.29— 31. %0a%0aThe Coluber cerastes of Linnaeus.

It is %0abut rarely that the hair falls off in women, and in eunuchs %0asuch is never known to be the case ; nor yet does any person %0alose it before having known sexual intercourse.®^ The hair %0adoes not fall off below the brain, nor yet beneath the crown of %0athe head, or around the ears and the temples. Man is the %0aonly animal that becomes bald, with the exception, of course, %0aof such animals as are naturally so. Man and the horse are %0athe only creatures whose hair turns grey ; but with man this is %0aalways the case, fii'st in the fore-part of the head, and then in %0athe hinder part. %0a%0aCHAP. 48. — THE BONES OF THE HEAD. %0a%0aSome few persons only are double- crowned. The bones of %0athe head are flat, thin, devoid of marrow, and united with su- %0atures indented like a comb. When broken asunder they can- %0anot be united, but the extraction of a small portion is not ne- %0acessarily fatal, as a fleshy cicatrix forms, and so makes good %0athe loss. We have already mentioned, in their respective** %0aplaces, that the skull of the bear is the weakest of all, and %0athat of the parrot the hardest. %0a%0aCHAP. 49. THE BEAIN. %0a%0aThe brain exists in all animals which have blood, and in %0athose sea animals as well, which we have already mentioned %0aas mollusks, although they are destitute of blood, the poly- %0apus, for instance. Man, however, has, in proportion to his %0abody, the most voluminous brain of all. This, too, is the %0amost humid, and the coldest of all the viscera, and is enve- %0aloped above and below with two membranous integuments, %0afor either of which to be broken is fatal. In addition to these %0afacts, we may remark that the brain is larger in men than iu %0a%0a«i Sec B. v. c. 29. %0a%0a%3c^a\aKpoKupa^. See B. X.

The skull of the bear is not thinner %0aor weaker than that of other animals of its own size ; but the skull of iLe %0aparrot, in proportion to those of other birds, is remarkably hard. %0a%0a%0a%0a48 %0a%0a%0a%0aPLTNT'S NATURAL HISTOBT. %0a%0a%0a%0a[Book XL %0a%0a%0a%0awomen. In man the brain is destitute of blood and veins, and %0ain other animals it has no fat. Those who are well informed %0aon the subject, tell us that the brain is quite a different %0asubstance from the marrow, seeing that on being boiled it %0aonly becomes harder. In the very middle of the braia of %0aevery animal there are small bones found. Man is the only ani- %0amal in which it is kno-svn to palpitate"^ during infancy ; and %0ait does not gain its proper consistency until after the child has %0amade its first attempt to speak. The brain is the most ele- %0avated of all the viscera, and the nearest to the roof of the %0ahead ; it is equally devoid of flesh, blood, and excretions. The %0asenses hold this organ as their citadel ; it is in this that %0aare centred all the veins which spring from the heart ; it is %0ahere that they terminate ; this is the very culminating point of %0aall, the regulator of the understanding. "With all animals it %0ais advanced to the fore-part of the head, from the fact that %0athe senses have a tendency to the direction in which we look. %0aFrom the brain proceeds sleep, and its return it is that causes %0athe head to nod. Those creatures, in fact, which have no brain, %0anever sleep. It is said that stags^^ have in the head certain %0asmall maggots, twenty in number : they are situate in the %0aempty space that lies beneath the tongue, and around the joints %0aby which the head is united to the body. %0a%0aCHAP. 50. — THE EAKS. ANIMALS WHICH HEAB WITHOUT EiES %0aOil APERTXJKES. %0a%0aMan is the only animal the ears of which are immoveable. %0aIt is from the natural flaccidity of the ear, that the surname %0aof Flaccus is derived. There is no part of the body that %0acreates a more enormous expense for our women, in the %0apearls which are suspended from them. In the East, too, it %0ais thought highly becoming for the men, even, to wear gold %0arings in their ears. Some animals have large, and others %0asmall ears. The stag alone has them cut and divided, as it %0awere ; in the field-mouse they have a velvet surface. AU the %0aanimals that are viviparous have ears of some kind or other, %0awith the sole exception of the sea-calf, the dolphin, the fishes %0a%0a85 See B. vii. c. 1. %0a%0a65 Cuvier says that fhese are the larvae of the oestrus, which are deposited %0aon the lips of quadrupeds, and so make their way to various cavities. %0a%0a%0a%0aCbap. 02.] %0a%0a%0a%0aTUE ElES. %0a%0a%0a%0a49 %0a%0a%0a%0awhich we have mentioned^' as cartilaginous, and the viper. %0aThese animals have only cavities instead of ears, with the ex- %0aception of the cartilaginous fishes and the dolphin, which last, %0ahowever, it is quite clear possesses the sense of hearing, for it is %0acharmed by singing, and is often taken while enraptured with %0athe melody: how it is that it does hear, is quite marvellous. %0aThese animals, too, have not the slightest trace of olfactory %0aorgans, and yet they have a most acute sense of smell. %0a%0aAmong the winged animals, only the horned owl and the long- %0aeared owl have feathers which project like ears, the rest having %0aonly cavities for the purpose of hearing ; the same is the case, %0aalso, with the scaly animals and the serpents. Among horses %0aand beasts of burden of all kinds, it is the ears which indicate %0athe natural feelings; when the animal is weary, they are droop- %0aing and flaccid ; when it is startled, they quiver to and fro ; %0awhen it is enraged, they are pricked up ; and when it is ailing, %0athey are pendant. %0a%0aCHAP. 51. — THE FACE, THE FOKEHEAD, AND THE ETE-BEOWS. %0a%0aMan is the only creature that has a face, the other animals %0ahaving only a muzzle or a beak. Other animals have a fore- %0ahead as well, but it is only on the forehead of man that is %0adepicted sorrow, gladness, compassion, or severity. It is the %0aforehead that is the index of the mind. Man has eyebrows, %0aalso, which move together or alternately ; these, too, serve in %0asome measure as indications of the feelings. Do we deny or %0ado we assent, it is the eyebrows, mostly, that indicate our %0aintentions. Feelings of pride may be generated elsewhere, %0abut it is here that they have their principal abode ; it is in the %0aheart that they take their rise, but it is to the eyebrows that %0athey mount, and here they take up their position. In no part %0aof the body could they meet with a spot more lofty and more %0aprecipitous, in which to establish themselves free from aU %0acontrol. %0a%0aCHAP. 52. THE EYES — ANIMAIS WHICH HAVE NO EYES, OR HAVE %0a%0aONLY ONE EYE. %0a%0aBelow the forehead are the eyes, which form the most pre- %0acious portion of the human body, and which, by the enjoyment %0a%0a8' B. ix. c. 40. %0a%0aVOL.

Eyes, %0ahowever, have not been granted to all animals ; oysters have %0anone, but, with reference to some of the shell-fish, the question %0ais still doubtful ; for if we move the fingers before a scallop %0ahalf open, it will immediately close its shell, apparently from %0aseeing them, while the solen^^ will start away from an iron %0ainstrument when placed near it. Among quadrupeds the %0amole*' has no sight, though it has something that bears a re- %0asemblance to eyes, if we remove the membrane that is ex- %0atended in front of them. Among birds also, it is said that %0aa species of heron, which is known as the "leucus,"^ is %0awanting of one eye : a bird of most excellent augury, when %0ait flies towards the south or north, for it is said that it %0aportends thereby that there is about to be an end of perils and %0aalarms. Nigidius says also, that neither locusts nor grass- %0ahoppers have eyes. In snails,**^ the two small horns with which %0athey feel their way, perform the duties of eyes. Neither tlie %0amawworm^- nor any other kind of worm has eyes. %0a%0aCHAP. 53. — THE DIVEESITY OF THE COLOUK OF THE EYES. %0a%0aThe eyes vary in colour in the human race only ; in all %0aother animals they are of one uniform colour peculiar to the %0akind, though there are some horses that have eyes of an azure %0acolour. But in man the varieties and diversities are most %0anumerous ; the eyes being either large, of middling size, re- %0amarkably small, or remarkably prominent. These last are %0agenerally supposed to be very weak, while those which are %0adeep-seated are considered the best, as is the case also with %0athose which in colour resemble the eyes of the goat. %0a%0aCHAP. 54. THE THEOET OF SIGHT — PERSONS WHO CAX SEE BT %0a%0aNIGHT. %0a%0aIn addition to this, there are some persons who can see to a %0a^ Or razor-sheath.

As Cuvier remarks, this is probably a mere %0aaugur's fable. %0a%0a^ It is almost needless to remark, that both snails, as well as locusts and %0agrasshoppers, have eyes. %0a8* Lumbricus. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 54.] %0a%0a%0a%0atBe theoet or sight. %0a%0a%0a%0a51 %0a%0a%0a%0avery great distance, while there are others, again, -who can only %0adistinguish objects when brought quite close to them. The %0avision of many stands in need of the rays of the sun ; such %0apersons cannot see on a cloudy day, nor yet after the sun has %0aset. Others, again, have bad sight in the day-time, but a %0asight superior to that of others by night. Of persons having %0adouble pupils, or the evil eye, we have already spoken'^ at %0asufficient length. Blue^* eyes are the best for seeing in the %0adark. %0a%0aIt is said that Tiberius Caesar, like no other human being, %0awas so endowed by Nature, that on awaking in the night** he %0acould for a few moments distinguish objects just as well as %0ain the clearest daylight, but that by degrees he would find %0ahis sight again enveloped in darkness. The late Emperor %0aAugustus had azure eyes like those of some horses, the white %0abeing larger than with other men ; he used to be verj' angry %0aif a person stared intently at them for this peculiarity. Claudius %0aCaesar had at the corners of the eyes a white fleshy substance, %0acovered with veins, which would occasionally become sufi'used %0awith blood ; with the Emperor Caius* they had a fixed, steady %0agaze, while Nero could see nothing distinctly without wink- %0aing, and having it brought close to his eyes. The Emperor %0aCaius had twenty pairs of gladiators in his training-school, %0aand of all these there were only two who did not wink the %0aeyes when a menacing gesture was made close to them : hence %0ait was that these men were invincible. So difficult a matter is %0ait for a man to keep his eyes from winking : indeed, to wink is %0aso natural to many, that they cannot desist from it ; such per- %0asons we generally look upon as the most timid. %0a%0aNo persons have the eye all of one colour ; that of the %0amiddle of the eye is always different from the white which %0asurrounds it. In all animals there is no part^in the whole %0abody that is a stronger exponent of the feelings, and in man %0amore especially, for it is from the expression of the eye that %0awe detect clemency, moderation, compassion, hatred, love, %0asadness, and joy. From the eyes, too, the various characters %0aof persons are judged of, according as they are ferocious, me- %0a%0a93 B. vii. c. 2. 9* " Caesii." %0a%0a^ The same has been said also of Cardan, the elder Scaliger, Theodore %0aBeza, the French physician Mairan, auJ tlie republican Camille Desmoulins. , %0as** Caligula. %0a%0aE 2 %0a%0a%0a%0a52 %0a%0a%0a%0aPLINr's NATUKAl HTSTOBT. %0a%0a%0a%0a[Book XI. %0a%0a%0a%0aiiacing, sparkling, sedate, leering, askance, downcast, or Ian- %0aguishing. Beyond a doubt it is in the eyes that the mind has %0aits abode : sometimes the look is ardent, sometimes fixed and %0asteady, at other times the eyes are humid, and at others, again, %0ahalf closed. From these it is that the tears of pity flow, and %0awhen we kiss them we seem to be touching the very soul. It %0ais the eyes that weep, and from them proceed those streams %0athat moisten our cheeks as they trickle down. And what is %0athis liquid that is always so ready and in such abundance in %0aour moments of grief, and where is it kept in reserve at other %0atimes ? It is by the aid of the mind that we see, by the aid %0aof the mind that we enjoy perception ; while the eyes, like so %0amany vessels, as it were, receive its visual faculties and trans- %0amit them. Hence it is that profound thought renders a man %0ablind for the time, the powers of sight being withdrawn fi'om %0aexternal objects and thrown inward : so, too, in epilepsy, the %0amind is covered with darkness, while the eyes, though open, %0aare able to see nothing. In addition to this, it is the fact %0athat hares, as well as many human beings, can sleep with %0athe eyes open, a thing which the Greeks express by the term %0azopy^avriav. Nature has composed the eye of numerous mem- %0abranes of remarkable thinness, covering them with a thick coat %0ato ensure their protection against heat and cold. This coat she %0apurifies from time to time by the lachrymal humours, and she %0ahas made the surface lubricous and slippery, to protect the eye %0aagainst the efi'ects of a sudden shock. %0a%0aCHAP. 55. THE NATUEE OF THE PUPIL EXES WHICH DO KOT %0a%0aSHUT. %0a%0aIn the midst of the cornea of the eye Nature has formed a %0awindow in the pupil, the small dimensions of which do not %0apermit the si^ht to wander at hazard and with uncertainty, %0abut direct it as straight as though it were through a tuhe, %0aand at the same time ensure its avoidance of all shocks com- %0amunicated by foreign bodies. The pupils are surrounded by a %0ablack circle in some persons, while it is of a yellowish cast with %0aothers, and azure again with others. By this happy combina- %0ation the light is received by the eye upon the white that lies %0aaround the pupU, and its reflection being thus tempered, it %0afails to impede or confuse the sight by its harshness. So %0acomplete a mirror, too, does the eye form, that the pupil, %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 55.] %0a%0a%0a%0aTHE NATtrnE OF THE PUPIL. %0a%0a%0a%0a53 %0a%0a%0a%0asmall as it is, is able to reflect the entire image of a man. %0aThis^ is the reason why most birds, when held in the hand %0aof a person, will more particularly peck at his eyes ; for seeing %0atheir own likeness reflected in the pupils, they are attracted to %0ait by what seem to be the objects of their natural affection. %0a%0aIt is only some few beasts of burden that are subject to %0amaladies of the eyes towards the increase of the moon : but it %0ais man alone that is rescued from blindness by the discharge %0aof the humours* that have caused it. Many persons have %0ahad their sight restored after being blind for twenty years ; %0awhile others, again, have been denied this blessing from their %0avery birth, without there being any blemish in the eyes. Many %0apersons, again, have suddenly lost tneir sight from no apparent %0acause, and without any preceding injury. The most learned %0aauthors say that there are veins which communicate from the %0aeye to the brain, but I am inclined to think that the communi- %0acation is with the stomach ; for it is quite certain that a person %0anever loses the ej'e without feeling sickness at the stomach. It %0ais an important and sacred duty, of high sanction among the %0aRomans, to close the eyes of the dead, and then again to open %0athem when the body is laid on the funeral pile, the usage %0ahaving taken its rise in the notion of its being improper - that %0athe eyes of the dead should be beheld by man, Avhile it is an %0aequally great offence to hide them from the view of heaven. %0aMan is the only living creature the eyes of which are subject %0ato deformities, from which, in fact, arose the family names of %0a" Strabo"^ and " Psetus." ^ The ancients used to call a man %0awho was born with only one eye, "codes," and " ocella," a %0aperson whose eyes were remarkably small. " Luscinus" was %0athe surname given to one who happened to have lost one eye %0aby an accident. %0a%0aThe eyes of animals that see at night in the dark, cats, for %0ainstance, are shining and radiant, so much so, that it is impos- %0asible to look upon them ; those of the she-goat, too, and the %0awolf are resplendent, and emit a light like fire. The eyes of %0athe sea-calf and the hy£ena change successively to a thousand %0a%0a^ Hardouin witli justice doubts the soundness of this alleged reason. %0aHe alludes, probably, to some method of curing cataract; perhaps %0asomewhat similar to that mentioned by him in B. xx. c. 20. %0a%0aThis was done by the nearest relatives. This usage still prevails in %0athis country, the eyelids being pressed down with pieces of gold or silver. %0a^ Or "squint-eyed." 2 Or "cock-eyed," %0a%0a%0a%0a51 %0a%0a%0a%0aPLIKT's NATirEAL HISTOET. %0a%0a%0a%0a[Book XI. %0a%0a%0a%0acolours ; and the eyes, when dried, of most of the fishes will %0agive out light in the dark, just in the same way as the trunk %0aof the oak when it has become rotten with extreme old age. %0aWe have already mentioned^ the fact, that animals which turn, %0anot the eyes but the head, for the purpose of looking round, %0aare never known to wink. It is said,* too, that the chame- %0aleon is able to roll the eye-balls completely round. Crabs look %0asideways, and have the eyes enclosed beneath a thin crust. %0aThose of craw-fish and shrimps are very hard and prominent, %0aand lie in a great measure beneath a defence of a similar %0anature. Those animals, however, the eyes of which are hard, %0ahave worse sight than those of which the eyes are formed of a %0ahumid substance. It is said that if the eyes are taken away %0afrom the young of serpents and of the swallow,^ they will grow %0aagain. In all insects and in animals covered with a shell, the %0aeyes move just in the same way as the ears of quadrupeds do; %0athose among them which have a brittle® covering have the %0aeyes hard. All animals of this nature, as well as fishes and %0ainsects, are destitute of eye-lids, and their eyes have no cover- %0aing ; but in all there is a membrane that is transparent like %0aglass, spread over them. %0a%0aCHAP. 56. — THE HAIU OF THE EYE-LIDS ; WHAT ANIMALS AEE %0aWITHOUT THEM. ANIMALS WHICH CAN SEE ON ONE SIDE ONLY. %0a%0aMan has lashes on the eye-lids on either side ; and women %0aeven make it their daily care to stain them ;'' so ardent are they %0ain the pursuit of beauty, that they must even colour their %0avery eyes. It was with another view, however, that Nature %0ahad provided the hair of the eyelids — they were to have acted, %0aso to say, as a kind of rampart for the protection of the sight, %0aand as an advanced bulwark against the approach of insects %0aor other objects which might accidentally come in their way. %0aIt is not without some reason that it is said that the eye- %0alashes^ fall off' with those persons who are too much given to %0avenereal pleasures. Of the other animals, the only ones that %0ahave eyelashes are those that have hair on the rest of the %0abody as well ; but the quadrupeds have them on the upper %0a%0a3 B. viii. c. 45. * B. viii. c. 51. %0a%0a5 See B.

The ostrich is the only one among the birds %0athat, like man, has eyelashes on either side. %0a%0aCHAT. 57. ANIMALS WHICH HATE NO EYELIDS. %0a%0aAll birds, however, have not eyelids: hence it is, that %0athose which are viviparous have no nictation of the eye. %0aThe heavier kinds of birds shut the eye by means of the %0alower eyelid, and they wink by drawing forward a mem- %0abrane which lies in the corner of the eye. Pigeons, and other %0abirds of a similar nature, shut the two eyelids ; but the quad- %0arupeds which are oviparous, such, for instance, as the tortoise %0aand the crocodile, have only the lower eyelid moveable, and %0anever wink, in consequence of the hardness of the eye. The %0aedge of the upper eyelid was by the ancients called " cilium," %0afrom which comes our word " supercilia.^" If the eyelid %0ahappens to be severed by a wound it will not reunite,'" which %0ais the case also with some few other parts of the human body. %0a%0aCHAP. 58. — THE CHEEKS. %0a%0aBelow the eyes are the cheeks, a feature which is found %0ain man only. From the ancients they received the name of %0a" gense," and by the laws of the Twelve Tables, women were %0aforbidden to tear them." The cheeks are the seat of %0abashfulness ; it is on them more particularly that blushes are %0ato be seen. %0a%0aCHAP. 59. THE NOSTEILS. %0a%0a"Within the cheeks is the mouth, which gives such Btrong %0aindications of the feelings of joyousness and laughter; and %0aabove it, but in man only, is the nose, which modem notions %0ahave stamped as the exponent of sarcasm and ridicule.''^ In %0ano other animal but man, is the nose thus prominent ; birds, %0aserpents, and fishes, have no nostrils, but apertures only for %0athe purpose of smell. It is from the peculiarity of the nose %0a%0a9 " The eyebrows." %0a%0a10 This is not the fact. %0a%0a1' With their nails when mourning for the dead. %0a%0a12 Hence the word "nasutus," a sneering, captious, or sarcastic man. %0a%0a%0a%0aflint's natural histoet. %0a%0a%0a%0a[Book XI. %0a%0a%0a%0athat are derived the surnames of " Simus" " and " Silo." %0aChildren born in the seventh month often have the ears and %0athe nostrils imperforate. %0a%0aCHAP, 60. — THE MOUTH ; THE LIPS ; THE CHIN ; AND THE %0aJAW-BONE. %0a%0aIt is from the " labia," or lips, that the Brocchi " have re- %0aceived the surname of Labeo. All animals that are viviparous %0ahave a mouth that is either well-formed, or harshly defined, %0aas the case may be. Instead of lips and mouth, the birds %0ahave a beak that is horny and sharp at the end. With birds %0athat live by rapine, the beak is hooked inwards, but with those %0awhich gather and peck only, it is straight : those animals, %0aagain, which root up grass or puddle in the mud, have the %0amuzzle broad, like swine. The beasts of burden employ the %0amouth in place of hands in gathering their food, while those %0awhich live by rapine and slaughter have it wider than the %0arest. No animal, with the exception of man, has either chin %0aor cheek-bones. The crocodile is the only animal that has the %0aupper jaw-bone'^ moveable; among the land quadrupeds it is %0athe same as with other animals, except that they can move it %0aobliquely. %0a%0aCHAP. 61. — THE TEETH ; THE VARIOUS KINDS OF TEETH ; IN WHAT %0aANIMALS THEY ARE NOT ON BOTH SIDES OF THE MOUTH : ANIMALS %0aWHICH HAVE HOLLOW TEETH. %0a%0aTeeth are arranged in three different ways, serrated, in one %0acontinuous row, or else protruding from the mouth. When %0aserrated they unite together, just like those of a comb, in order %0athat they may not be worn by rubbing against one another, as %0ain serpents, fishes, and dogs,^^ for instance. In some creatures %0athey are set in one continuous row, man and the horse, %0afor instance; while in the wild boar, the elephant, and the %0ahippopotamus, they protrude from the mouth," Among those %0aset in one continuous row, the teeth which divide the food %0aare broad and sharp, while those which grind it are double ; %0athe teeth which lie between the incisive and the molar %0ateeth, are those known as the canine or dog-teeth; these %0a%0a13 " Flat-nosed," and " snub-nosed," %0a%0a" A Roman family— the reading of this word seems doubtful. %0a%0a15 In reality, the under one only. %0a%0a16 He is incorrect in speaking of dogs as having serrated teeth. %0a" In the dugoag also, babiroussa, muntjac, and others. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 62.] %0a%0a%0a%0aTHE TEETH OF SEEPEI^TS. %0a%0a%0a%0a57 %0a%0a%0a%0aare by far the largest in those animals which have serrated %0ateeth. Those -animals which have continuous rows of teeth, %0ahave them either situate on both sides of the mouth, as in %0athe horse, or else have no fore-teeth in the upper part of the %0amouth, as is the case with oxen, sheep, and all the animals %0athat ruminate. The she-goat has no upper teeth, except the %0atwo front ones. No animals which have serrated teeth, have %0athem protruding'^ from the mouth ; among these, too, the fe- %0amales rarely have them ; and to those that do have them, they %0aare of no " use : hence it is, that while the boar strikes, the %0asow bites. No animal with horns has projecting teeth ; and %0aall such teeth are hollow, while in other animals the teeth are %0asolid. All-" fish have the teeth serrated, with the exception %0aof the scarus,'*' this being the only one among the aquatic %0aanimals that has them level-' at the edges. In addition to %0athis, there are many fishes that have teeth upon the tongue %0aand over the whole of the mouth, in order that, by the multi- %0atude of the bites which they inflict, they may soften those %0aarticles of food which they could not possibly manage by %0atearing. Many animals, also, have teeth in the palate, and %0aeven in the tail ; in addition to which, some have them in- %0aclining to the interior of the mouth, that the food may not %0afall out, the animal itself having no other means of retaining %0ait there. %0a%0aCHAP. 62.

The writers who have made the most %0adiUgent enquiries on the subject, inform us that this venom is %0anothing but the gall of the serpent, and that it is convoyed %0ato the mouth by certain veins which run beneath the spine; %0aindeed, there are some who state that there is only one poison- %0afang, and that being barbed at the end, it is bent backwards %0awhen the animal has inflicted a bite. Other writers, however, %0aaffirm that on such an occasion the fang falls out, as it is very %0aeasily displaced, but that it soon grows^* again; this tooth, %0athey say, is thus wanting in the serpents which we see %0ahandled about by persons.^^ It is also stated that this fang %0aexists in the tail of the scorpion, and that most of these animals %0ahave no less than three. The teeth of the viper are concealed %0ain the gums : the animal, being provided with a similar venom, %0aexercises the pressure of its fangs for the purpose of instilling %0athe poison in its bite. %0a%0aNo Avinged creatures have teeth, with the sole exception of %0athe bat. The camel is the only one among the animals with- %0aout horns, that has no fore-teeth ^® in the upper jaw. None of %0athe horned animals have serrated teeth. Snails, too, have %0ateeth ; a proof of which are the vetches which we find gnawed %0aaway by snails of the very smallest size. To assert that among %0amarine animals, those that have shells, and those that are %0acartilaginous have fore-teeth, and that the sea-urchin has five %0ateeth, I am very much surprised how such a notion could have %0apossibly-® arisen. "With insects the sting supplies the place of %0ateeth ; the ape has teeth just like those in man.^^ The elephant %0a%0a^ There is always one fang, at least, ready to supply the place of the one %0ain front, if lost by any accident. %0a%0a" Like the jugglers of the East at the present day. But it is very %0adoubtful whether the poison fang is in all instances previously extracted %0afrom the serpents which they handle. %0a%0a26 But the camel, as well as the lama, has an incisive bone, provided %0awith an incisive tooth on each side, and has canine and molar teeth as well. %0a%0a27 If by this terni he means teeth separated from each other, the asser- %0ation is incorrect, as in these animals we find the molars separated from the %0alower incisives by a very considerable space. %0a%0a'^8 Cuvier says, as far as the sea-urchin is concerned, very simply, and %0amerely by looking at it, as its five teeth are very apparent. %0a%0a29 The incisors are in number, and very nearly in appearance, like those %0aof man. The canines are difi"erent in shape, though similar in number. %0aWhat he says about the elephant, is peculiar to that of India. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 63.] %0a%0a%0a%0aTHE TEETH. %0a%0a%0a%0a59 %0a%0a%0a%0ahas in the interior of the mouth fourteen teeth, adapted for %0achewing, in addition to those which protrude ; in the male %0athese are curved inwards, but in the female they are straight, %0aand project outwards. The sea-mouse,^" a fish which goes be- %0afore the balaena, has no teeth at all, but in place of them, the %0ainterior of the mouth is lined with bristles, as well as the tongue %0aand palate. Among the smaller land quadrupeds, the two %0afore-teeth in each jaw are the longest. %0a%0aCHAP. 63. WONDERFUL CIECTJMSTANCES CONKECTED WITH THE %0a%0aTEETH. %0a%0aThe other animals are born with^^ teeth, whereas man has %0athem only at the seventh month after his birth. "While %0aother animals keep their teeth to the time of their death, %0aman, the lion, the beasts of burden, the dog, and the rumi- %0anating animals, all change them ; the lion and the dog, how- %0aever, change none''* but the canine teeth. The canine tooth of %0athe wolf, on the right side, is held in high esteem as an amulet.'* %0aThere is no animal that changes the maxillary teeth, which %0astand beyond the canine teeth. With man, the last teeth, %0awhich are known as the " genuini," or cheek teeth, ^® come %0aabout the twentieth year, and with many men, and females as %0awell, so late even as the eightieth ; but this only in the case %0aof those who have not had them in their youth. It is a %0awell-known fact, that the teeth are sometimes shed in old age, %0aand replaced by others. Mucianus has stated that he, himself, %0asaw one Zocles, a native of Samothrace, who had a new set of %0ateeth when he was past his one hundred and fourth year. In %0aaddition to these facts, in man males have more teeth than %0afemales,^' which is the case also in sheep, goats, and swine. %0a%0a30 See B. ix. c. 88. %0a%0a31 Very few other animals are born with teeth, in their natural state. %0aApes, dogs, and cats are not born with teeth. %0a%0a32 From the fourth to the eighth month in reality, during which the %0afour central incisors appear. %0a%0a3» The only ones that do not change are those which have three molars %0aon each side of the jaw. %0a31 This is erroneous : they change the incisors and molars as well. %0a%0a35 See B. xxviii. c. 78. %0a%0a36 By us known as the "wisdom" teeth. %0a%0a" This is not the fact : they have usually the same number, but there %0aare exceptions on both sides. The same is also the case with sheep, goats, %0aand swine. %0a%0a%0a%0a60 %0a%0a%0a%0aFlint's natueal history. %0a%0a%0a%0a[Book XI. %0a%0a%0a%0aTimarchus, the son of Nicocles the Paphian, had a double*' %0arow of teetli in his jaws : the same person had a brother also %0awho never changed his front teeth, and, consequently, wore %0athem to the very stumps. There is an instance, also, of a man %0ahaving a tooth growing in the palate.^^ The canine teeth," %0awhen lost by any accident, are never known to come again. %0a"While in all other animals the teeth grow of a tawny colour %0awith old age, with the horse, and him only, they become whiter %0athe older he grows. %0a%0aCHAP. 64. HOW AN ESTIMATE IS FORMEI) OF THE AGE %0a%0aOF ANIMALS FROM THEIK TEETH. %0a%0aThe age, in beasts of burden,*' is indicated by the teeth. In %0athe horse they are forty in number. At thirty months it %0aloses the two fore-teeth in either jaw, and in the following year %0athe same number next to them, at the time that the eye-teeth** %0acome. At the beginning of the fifth year the animal loses two %0ateeth, which grow again in the sixth, and in the seventh it has %0aall its teeth, those which have replaced the others, and those %0a"which have never been changed. If a horse is gelded^^ before %0ait changes its teeth, it never sheds them. In a similar manner, %0aalso, the ass loses four of its teeth in the thirtieth month, and %0athe others from six months to six months. If a she-ass hap- %0apens not to have foaled before the last of these teeth are shed, %0ait is sure to be barren.** Oxen change their teeth at two years %0aold: with swine they are never changed." When these %0aseveral indications of age have been lost in horses and other %0abeasts of burden, the age is ascertained by the projecting of %0athe teeth, the greyness of the hair in the eyebrows, and the %0ahollow pits that form around them ; at this period the animal %0ais supposed to be about sixteen*^ years old. In the human %0a%0a38 This is not very uncommon. %0a%0a2' Not at all an uncommon occurrence. %0a%0a*" Of the second set. %0a%0a*i It is only in the horse and the ass that these indications can be re- %0alied upon. « Columellares. %0a%0a*3 This has no such effect. %0a%0aThe contrary is the case : it will be more prolific. %0a%0a*5 Swine change them just the same as other animals. %0a%0a« By certain appearances in the incisors, the age of ' a horse up to ite %0atwenty-fourth year, or even beyond, may be judged of : the other sigus %0acannot be so positively relied upon. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap.

When teething %0afirst commences, the bodies of infants are subject to certain %0amaladies. Those animals which have serrated teeth inflict the %0amost dangerous bites.** %0a%0aCHAP. 65. THE TONGUE ; ANIMALS "WHICH HAVE NO %0a%0aTONGUE. THE NOISE MADE BY FKOGS. THE PALATE. %0a%0aThe tongue is not similarly formed in all animals. Ser- %0apents have a very thin tongue, and three-forked,*'* which they %0avibrate to and fro : it is of a black colour, and when drawn %0afrom out of the mouth, of extraordinary length. The tongue %0aof the lizard is two-forked, and covered with hair.* That of %0athe sea-calf also is twofold,*' but with the serpents it is of the %0athinness of a hair ; the other animals employ it to lick the %0aparts around the mouth. Fishes have nearly the whole of the %0atongue adhering to the palate, while in the crocodile the whole %0aof it does adhere thereto : but in the aquatic animals the palate, %0awhich is fleshy, performs the duty of the tongue as the organ %0aof taste. In lions, pards, and all the animals of that class, %0aand in cats as well, the tongue is covered with asperities,*^ %0awhich overlap each other, and bear a strong resemblance to a %0arasp. Such being its formation, if the animal licks a man's skin, %0ait will wear it away by making it thinner and thinner ; for %0awhich reason it is that the saliva of even a perfectly tame %0aanimal, being thus introduced to the close vicinity of the blood, %0ais apt to bring on madness. Of the tongue of the purple we %0ahave made mention*^ already. With the frog the end of the %0atongue adheres to the mouth, while the inner part is disjoined %0afrom the sides of the gullet ; and it is by this means that the %0amales give utterance to their croaking, at the season at which %0a%0aB. viii. c. 15. %0a%0a** " Sffivissima dentibus," seems to be a preferable reading to " ssevissime %0adentiunt." *^ Only two-forked in reality. %0a%0a^ It is not covered with hair. %0a%0a" It is not bifurcate. %0a%0aThese are horny, conical papillne, the summits of which point back- %0awards. °^ See li. ix. c. 60. %0a%0a%0a%0a62 %0a%0a%0a%0aFlint's natural history. %0a%0a%0a%0a[Book Xr. %0a%0a%0a%0athey are known as ololygones.^ This liappens at stated periods %0aof the year, at which the males invite the females for the %0apurposes of propagation : letting down the lower lip to the %0asurface of the water, they receive a small portion of it in the %0amouth, and then, by quavering with the tongue, make a gur- %0agling noise, from which the croaking is produced which we %0ahear. In making this noise, the folds of the mouth, becoming %0adistended, are quite transparent, and the eyes start from the %0ahead and burn again with the effort. Those insects which %0ahave a sting in the lower part of the body, have teeth, and a %0atongue as well ; with bees it is of considerable length, and in %0athe grasshopper it is very prominent. Those insects which have %0aa fistulous sting in the mouth, have neither tongue nor teeth ; %0awhile others, again, have a tongue in the interior of the mouth, %0athe ant, for instance. In the elephant the tongue is remark- %0aably broad ; and while with all other animals, each according %0ato -its kind, it is always perfectly at liberty, with man, and %0ahim alone, it is often found so strongly tied down by certain %0aveins, that it becomes necessary to cut them. "We find it %0astated that the pontiff Metellus had a tongue so ill adapted for %0aarticulation, that he is generally supposed to have voluntarily %0asubmitted to torture for many months, while preparing to %0apronounce the speech which he was about to make on the de- %0adication of the temple of Opifera.*" In most persons the %0atongue is able to articulate with distinctness at about the %0aseventh year ; and many know how to employ it with such re- %0amarkable skill, as to be able to imitate the voices of various %0abirds and other animals with the greatest exactness. The other %0aanimals have the sense of taste centred in the fore-part of the %0atongue ; but in man it is situate in the palate as well. %0a%0aCHAP. 66. THE TONSILS ; THE UVA ; THE EPIGLOSSIS ; THE %0a%0aAETEKY ; THE GULLET. %0a%0aIn man there are tonsils at the root of the tongue ; these in %0aswine are called the glandules. The uvula, which is suspended %0abetween them at the extremity of the palate, is found only %0ain man.

Placed as it is between two passages, the functions %0aof the epiglottis are of a twofold nature. The one of these %0apassages that lies more inward is called the [tracheal] artery %0aand hjads to the lungs and the heart : the epiglottis covers it %0aduring the action of eating, that the drink or food may not go %0athe wrong way, and so be productive of suffering, as it is by %0athis passage that the breath and the voice are conveyed. The %0aother or exterior passage is called the "guk,"* and it is by %0athis passage that the victuals and drink pass : this leads to the %0abelly, while the former one communicates with the chest.** %0aThe epiglottis covers the pharynx, in its turn, when only the %0abreath or the voice is passing, in order that the victuals may %0anot inopportunely pass upwards, and so disturb the breathing %0aor articulation. The tracheal artery is composed of cartilage %0aand flesh, while the gullet is formed of a sinewy substance %0aunited with flesh. %0a%0aCHAP. 67.— THE NECK ; THE THEOAT ; THE DOKSAL SPINE. %0a%0aThe neck is found to exist in no animal but those which %0ahave both these passages. All the others which have the %0agullet only, have nothing but a gorge or throat. In those %0awhich have a neck, it is formed of several rounded vertebrse, %0aand is flexible, and joined together by distinct articulations, to %0aallow of the animal turning round the head to look. The %0alion, the wolf, and the hyaena are the only animals in which %0ait is formed of a single*' rigid bone. The neck is annexed to %0athe spine, and the spine to the loins. The vertebral column %0aIS of a bony substance, but rounded, and pierced within, %0ato afford a passage for the marrow to descend from the brain! %0aIt is generally concluded that the marrow is of the same nature %0aas the brain, from the fact that if the membrane of exceedino- %0athinness which covers it is pierced, death immediately ensues.^ %0aThose animals which have long legs have a long throat as well, %0a%0a" More generally " epiglottis."

The upper part of the gullet is called %0athe fauces, the lower the stomach.*^ By this name is understood %0aa fleshy concavity, situate behind the tracheal artery, and join- %0aing the vertebral column ; it extends in length and breadth %0alike a sort of chasm.^' Those animals which have no^ gullet %0ahave no stomach either, nor yet any neck or throat, fishes, for %0aexample ; and in all these the mouth communicates immedi- %0aately with the belly. The sea- tortoise'*^ has neither tongue %0anor teeth ; it can break anything, however, with the sharp %0aedge of its muzzle. After the tracheal artery there is the %0aoesophagus, which is indented with hard asperities resembUng %0abramble- thorns, for the purpose of levigating the food, the in- %0acisions^^ gradually becoming smaller as they approach the belly. %0aThe roughness at the very extremity of this organ strongly re- %0asembles that of a blacksmith's file %0a%0achap. 69. — THE heart; the blood; the vital spirit. %0aIn all other animals but man the heart is situate in the %0amiddle of the breast; in man alone it is placed just below %0athe pap on the left-hand side, the smaller end terminating in %0aa point, and bearing outward. It is among the fish only that %0athis point is turned towards the mouth. It is asserted that %0athe heart is the first among the viscera that is formed in the %0afoetus, then the brain, and last of all, the eyes : it is said, too, %0athat the eyes are the first organs that die, and the heart the %0avery last of all.

From this source proceed two large %0aveins, which branch into the fore-part and the back of the body, %0aand which, spreading out in a series of branches, convey the %0avital blood by other smaller veins over all parts of the body. %0aThis is the only one^^ among the viscera that is not affected by %0amaladies, nor is it subject to the ordinary penalties of human %0alife ; but when injured, it produces instant death.

When the late %0aEmperor Augustus was sacrificing at Spoletum, upon the first %0aday of his entering on the imperial dignity, in six diff'erent %0avictims the liver was found rolled over within itself, from the %0avery lowest lobe ; and the answer that was given by the diviners %0awas to the effect that, in the course of the j-ear, he would gain %0aa twofold sway. It is of evil omen to find an incision in the %0ahead of the entrails, except on occasions of disquietude and %0aalarm ; for then it is significant of cutting all cares, and so %0aputting an end to them. The hares that are found in the %0avicinity of Briletum ®^ and Thame, and in the Chersonnesus %0aon the Propontis, have a double liver; but, what is very %0asingular, if they are removed to another place, they will lose %0aone of them. %0a%0aCHAP. 74. THE GALL ; AVHEEE SITUATE, AND IN WHAT ANIMALS %0a%0aIT IS DOUBLE.

At Chalcis, in Euboea, none of the cattle have %0ait, while in the cattle of the Isle of Naxos, it is of extraordi- %0anary size, and double, so that to a stranger either of these facts %0awould appear as good as a prodigy. The horse, the mule, the %0aass, the stag, the roe-buck, the wild boar, the camel, and the %0adolphin have no gall, but some kinds of rats and mice have it. %0a%0aPlutarch says that it was the "caput," or "head" of the liver that %0awas wanting.

There are some authors who say that %0athe gall exists in the horse, not in the liver, but in the paunch, %0aand that in the stag it is situate either in the tail or the %0aintestines ; and that hence it is, that those parts are so bitter %0athat dogs will not touch them. The gall, in fact, is nothing %0aelse but the worst parts of the blood purged off, and for this %0areason it is that it is so bitter : at all events, it is a well-known %0afact, that no animal has a liver unless it has blood as well. %0aThe liver receives the blood from the heart, to which it is %0aunited, and then disperses it in the veins. %0a%0aCnAP. 75. THE PKOPEKTIES OF THE GALL. %0a%0aA^Tien the gall is black, it is productive of madness in man, %0aand if it is wholly expelled death will ensue. Hence it is, too, %0athat the word " bile" has been employed by us to characterize %0aa harsh, embittered disposition; so powerful are the effects %0aof this secretion, when it extends its influence to the mind. %0aIn addition to this, Avhen it is dispersed over the whole of %0athe body, it deprives the eyes, even, of their natural colour ; %0aand when ejected, will tarnish copper vessels even, rendering %0aeverything black with which it comes in contact ; so that no %0aone ought to be surprised that it is the gall which constitutes %0athe venom of serpents. Those o,nimals of Pontus which feed %0aon wormwood have no gall : in the raven, the quail, and the %0apheasant, the gall-bladder is united to the renal parts, and, on %0aone side only, to the intestines. In many animals, again, it %0ais united onlj' to the intestines, the pigeon, the hawk, and the %0amurena, for example. In some few birds it is situate in the %0aliver ; but it is in serpents and fishes that it is the largest in %0aproportion. AVith the greater part of birds, it extends all along %0athroughout the intestines, as in the hawk and the kite. In %0asome other birds, also, it is situate in the breast as well : the %0agall, too, of the sea-calf is celebrated for its application to many %0apurposes. From the gall of the bull a colour is extracted like %0athat of gold. The'aruspices have consecrated the gall to Nep- %0atune and the influence of water. The Emperor Augustus %0afound a double gall in a victim which he was sacrificing on %0athe day of his victory at Actium. %0a%0a%0a%0a70 %0a%0a%0a%0aFLINT'S NATTTBAL HISTOBT. %0a%0a%0a%0a[Book XI. %0a%0a%0a%0aCHA.P. 76, — m WHAT ANIMALS THE XITER INCREASES AND DE- %0aCREASES WITH THE MOON.

The liver is remarkable for its powers %0aof preservation, and sieges have afforded us remarkable in- %0astances of its being kept so long as a hundred years.^ %0a%0aCHAP. 77. THE DIAPHRAGM. THE NATURE OF LAUGHTER. %0a%0aThe entrails of serpents and lizards are of remarkable length. %0aIt is related that — a most fortunate omen — Csecina of Volaterrae %0abeheld two dragons arising from the entrails of the victim ; %0aand this will not be at all incredible, if we are ready to beUeve %0athat while King Pyrrhus was sacrificing, the day upon which %0ahe died, the heads of the victims, on being cut off, crawled %0aalong the ground and licked up their own blood. In man, the %0aentrails are separated from the lower part of the viscera by a %0acertain membrane, which is called the " praecordia," ^ because %0ait is extended in front of the heart ; the Greeks have given it %0athe name of " phrenes." AU the principal viscera have been %0aenclosed by Nature, in her prudent foresight, in their own pe- %0aculiar membranes, just like so many sheaths, in fact. With re- %0aference to the diaphragm, there was a peculiar reason for this %0awise provision of Nature, its proximity to the guts, and the %0achances that the food might possibly intercept the respiration. %0aIt is to this organ that is attributed quick and ready wit, and %0ahence it is that it has no fleshy parts, but is composed of line %0asinews and membranes. This part is also the chief seat of %0agaiety of mind, a fact which is more particularly proved by %0athe titillation of the arm-holes, to which the midriff extends ; %0a%0a^ There must he some corrupt reading here ; for, as Sillig remarks, %0awho ever heard of a siege which, lasted a hundred years } %0a%0a85 Or diaphragm; from "prce," "before," and " cor,'" the " heart." %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 79.] %0a%0a%0a%0aTHE INTESTINES. %0a%0a%0a%0a71 %0a%0a%0a%0aindeed, in no part of the body is the skin more fine ; for this %0areason it is, also, that we experience such peculiar pleasure in %0ascratching the parts in its vicinity.

In other animals it is single, but in %0athose which ruminate it is double ; in those, again, which %0aare destitute of blood, there is no belly, for the intestinal %0acanal commences in some of them at the mouth, and returns to %0athat part, as is the case with the sa^pia and the polypus. In %0aman it is connected with the extremity of the stomach, and %0athe same with the dog. These are the only creatures that %0ahave the belly more narrow at the lower part ; hence it is, %0atoo, that they are the only ones that vomit, for on the beUy %0abeing filled, the narroAvness at its extremity precludes the food %0afrom passing ; a thing that cannot possibly be the case with %0athe animals in M'hich the belly is more capacious at the ex- %0atremity, and so leaves a free passage for the food to the lower %0aparts of the body. %0a%0aCHAP. 79. THE SMALL GTTTS, THE FRONT INTESTINES, THE ANTTS, %0a%0aTHE COLON. THE CAUSES OF THE INSATIATE VORACITY OF CER- %0aTAIN ANIMALS. %0a%0aAfter the belly we find in man and the sheep the " lactes,"^ %0athe place of which in other animals is occupied by the %0a"hillae:"*® it is through these organs that the food passes. %0aWe then find the larger intestines, which communicate with %0athe anus, and which in man consist of extremely sinuous %0afolds. Those animals which have the longest intestinal canal, %0aare the most voracious ; and those which have the belly the %0amost loaded with fat, are the least intelligent. There are %0asome birds, also, which have two receptacles ; the one of %0awhich is the crop, in which they stow away the food which %0a%0a^ "With Sardonic laughter, as Hardouin remarks. %0a%0a«' Or small guts.

The other birds %0aare in general destitute of crop, but then they have a more ca- %0apacious gorge, the jackdaw, the raven, and the crow, for in- %0astance : some, again, are constituted in neither manner, but %0ahave the belly close to the gorge, those, for instance, which %0ahave the neck very long and narrow, such as the porphyrio.*' %0aIn the solid-hoofed animals the belly is rough and hard, %0awhile in some laud animals it is provided with rough asperi- %0aties like teeth,^ and in others, again, it has a reticulated sur- %0aface like that of a file. Those animals which have not the %0ateeth on both sides, and do not ruminate, digest the food in %0athe belly, from whence it descends to the lower intestines. %0aThere is an organ in all animals attached in the middle to %0athe navel, and in man similar in its lower part to that of the %0aswine, the name given thereto by the Greeks being " colon," %0aa part of the body which is subject to excruciating pains." %0aIn dogs this gut is extremely contracted, for which reason it is %0athat they are unable to ease it, except by great efforts, and not %0awithout considerable suffering. Those animals with which the %0afood passes at once from the belly through the straight intestine, %0aare of insatiate appetite, as, for instance, the hind-wolf,^ and %0aamong birds the diver. The elephant has fonr^^ bellies ; the %0arest of its intestines are similar to those of the swine, and %0athe lungs are four times as large as those of the ox. The belly %0ain bii-ds is fleshy, and formed of a callous substance. In that %0aof young swallows there are found little white or pink pebbles, %0aknown by the name of " chelidonii," and said to be employed %0ain magical incantations.

To %0athis membrane is attached the spleen, which lies on the left %0aside, and opposite the liver : sometimes, indeed, it changes %0aplace with the liver, but such a case is looked upon as nothing %0aless than a prodigy. Some persons imagine that a spleen of %0aextremely diminutive size exists in the oviparous animals, %0aas also in serpents ; at all events, it is to be detected in the %0atortoise, the crocodile, the lizard, and the frog ; though it %0ais equally certain that it does not exist in the bird known as %0athe " aegocephalos," nor yet in those animals which are des- %0atitute of blood. The spleen sometimes offers a peculiar impe- %0adiment in running, for which reason the region of the spleen %0ais cauterized'" in runners who are troubled with pains there. %0aIt is said also, that if the spleen is removed'^ by an incision, %0aanimals may survive. There are some persons who think %0athat with the spleen man loses the power of laughing, and %0athat excessive laughter is caused by the overgrowth of it. %0aThere is a territory of Asia, known as Scepsis,'* in which it is %0asaid that the spleen of the cattle is remarkably small, and %0athat from thence it is that remedies for diseases of the spleen %0ahave been introduced. %0a%0aCHAP. 81. — THE KIDNETS : ANIMALS WHICH HAVE FOUR KID- %0aNEYS.

In both kid- %0aneys there is a certain streak of fiit running from the middle, %0awith the sole exception of those of the sea-calf. It is above %0athe kidneys, also, that animals are fattest, and the accumula- %0ation of fat about them is often the cause of death in sheep. %0aSmall stones are sometimes found in the kidneys. All quad- %0arupeds that are viviparous have kidneys, but of those which %0aare oviparous the toi'toise is the only one that has them ; an %0aanimal which has all the other viscera, but, like man, has the %0akidneys composed, to all appearance, of several kidneys, similar %0ato those of the ox. %0a%0aCHAP. 82. — THE beeast: the bibs. %0a%0aNature has placed the breast, or, in other words, certain %0abones, around the diaphragm and the organs of life, but not %0aaround the belly, for the expansion of which it -was necessary %0athat room should be left. Indeed, there is no animal that %0ahas any bones around the belly. Man is the only creature %0athat has a broad breast ; in all others it is of a carinated %0ashape, in birds more particularly, and most of all, the aquatic %0abirds. The ribs of man are only eight in number ; swine %0ahave ten, the homed animals thirteen, and serpents thirty. %0a%0aCHAP. 83. — THE BLADDEU : ANIMALS AVHICH HAVE NO BLADDER. %0a%0aBelow the paunch, on the anterior side, lies the bladder, %0awhich is never found in any oviparous animal, with the ex- %0aception of the tortoise, nor yet in any animal that has not %0alungs with blood, or in any one that is destitute of feet. %0aBetween it and the paunch are certain arteries, which extend %0ato the pubes, and are known as the " ilia." In the bladder of %0athe wolf there is found a small stone, which is called " syrites ;" %0aand in the bladders of some persons calculi are sometimes %0afound, which produce most excruciating pains ; small hairs, %0alike bristles, are also occasionally found in the bladder. This %0aorgan consists of a membrane, which, when once wounded, does %0anot' cicatrize, just like those in which the brain and the heart %0aare enveloped : there are many kinds of membranes, in fact. %0aI This is a mistake.

Another name for this partis %0a" loci but in other .animals it is known by the name of %0a"vulva." AVith the viper and other animals which generate %0atheir young within themselves, the womb is double ; while %0awith those which are oviparous, it is attached to the diaphragm. %0aIn woman it has two concavities, one on either side : when %0athe matrix becomes displaced, it is productive of fatal effects, by %0acausing suffocation.'' It is asserted that the cow, when preg- %0anant, carries her young only in the right concavity of the womb, %0aand that this is the case even when she produces twins. The %0awomb of the sow is considered better eating if she has slipped her %0ayoung, than if she has duly brought forth : in the former case %0ait is known by the name of " ejectitia," in the latter it is %0acalled " porcaria." The womb of a sow that has farrowed only %0aonce is the most esteemed, and that of those which have %0aceased farrowing, the least. After farrowing, unless the ani- %0amal is killed the same day, the womb is of a livid colour, and %0alean. This part, however, is not esteemed in a young sow, %0aexcept just after the fii'st farrowing : indeed, it is much more %0ahighly valued in an animal of a more mature age, so long as it %0ais not past breeding, or has been killed two days before far- %0arowing, or two days after, or upon the day on which it has %0amiscarried. The next best after that of a sow that has mis- %0acaiTied, is that of one that has been killed the day after far- %0arowing : indeed, the paps of this last, if the young have not %0abegun to suck, are excellent eating, while those of an animal %0athat has miscarried are very inferior. The ancients called this %0apart by the name of " abdomen," before it grew hard, and %0awere not in the habit of killing swine while in a state of %0apregnancy. %0a%0aCHAP. 85.

This fat becomes hard, and when quite %0acold turns brittle, and is always found at the extremity of the %0aflesh ; while, on the other hand, the fat which lies between the %0askin and the flesh forms a kind of liquid juice. Some animals %0anaturally do not become fat, such as the hare and the par- %0atridge, for instance. All fat animals, male as well as female, %0aare mostly barren ; and those which are remarkably fat become %0aold the soonest. All animals have a certain degree of fatness %0ain the eyes. The fat in all animals is devoid of sensation, %0ahaving neither arteries nor veins. With the greater part of %0aanimals, fatness is productive of insensibility ; so much so, %0aindeed, that it has been said, that living swine have been %0agnawed even by mice. ® It has been even asserted that the fat %0awas drawn off from the body of a son of L.

It is only found in those bones which are hollow, and %0anot in the tibiae of horses or dogs ; for which reason it is, that %0awhen the tibia is broken, the bone will not reunite, a process %0awhich is effected ^ by the flow of the marrow. The marrow is %0aof a greasy nature in those animals which have fat, and suetty %0ain those with horns.

Among aquatic animals, the mollusks %0ahave no bones, but the body is surrounded with circles of %0aflesh, as in the ssepia and the cuttle-fish, for instance ; insects, %0aalso, are said to be equally destitute of bones. Among aquatic %0aanimals, those which are cartilaginous have marrow in the %0avertebral column ; the sea-calf has cartilages, and no bones. %0aThe ears also, and the nostrils in all animals, when remarkably %0aprominent, are made flexible by a remarkable provision of %0aNature, in order that they may not be broken. When cartilage %0ais once broken, it will not unite ; nor will bone, when cut, grow %0aagain, except in beasts of burden, between the hoof and the %0apastern. %0a%0aMan increases in height till his twenty-first year, after %0awhich he fills out ; bul^ it is more particularly when he first %0aarrives at the age of puberty that he seems to have untied a %0asort of knot in his existence, and this especially when he has %0abeen overtaken by illness. %0a%0aCHAP. 88. — THE NEEVE : ANIMALS WHICH HAVE NONE. %0a%0aThe nerves ^ take their rise at the heart, and even surround %0ait in the ox ; they have the same nature and principle as the %0amarrow.

There is great vitality, too, %0ain the blood, and when it is discharged from the body, it %0acarries the life with it : it is not sensible, however, of touch. %0aThose animals in which the blood is the thickest are the most %0acourageous, and those in which it is the thinnest the most %0aintelligent; while those, again, which have little or no blood are %0athe most timorous of all. The blood of the bull coagulates and %0ahardens the most sjjeedily of all, and hence it is so particu- %0alarly deadly when drunk. On the other hand, the blood of %0athe wild boar, the stag, the roe-buck, and oxen of all kinds, %0adoes not coagulate. Blood is of the richest quality in the ass, %0aand the poorest in man. Those animals which have more than %0afour feet have no blood. In animals which are very fat, the %0ablood is less abundant than in others, being soaked up by the %0afat. Man is the only creature from which the blood flows at %0athe nostrils ; some persons bleed at one nostril only, some at %0aboth, while others again void blood by the lower " parts. %0aMany persons discharge blood from the mouth at stated periods, %0asuch, for instance, as Macrinus Viscus, lately, a man of prae- %0atorian dignity, and Volusius Saturninus,'- the Prefect of the %0aCity, who every year did the same, and yet lived to beyond %0aninety. The blood is the only substance in the body that is %0asensible of any temporary increase, for a larger quantity will %0acome from the victims if they happen to have drunk just %0abefore tliey arc sacrificed. %0a%0aCHAP. 91. ANIMALS WHICH ARE WITHOUT BLOOD AT CEKTAIN %0a%0aPEKIODS Oli" THE YEAR. %0a%0aThose animals which conceal themselves'^ at certain periods %0aof the year, as already mentioned, have no blood at those times, %0awith the exception, indeed, of some very small drops about the %0a%0aSee B. xxviii. c. 41. %0a" 111 allusion, probably, to hgemorilioids, or piles. %0a1^ See B. vii. c.

A marvellous dispensation of Nature ! and very similar %0ato that witnessed in man, where the blood is sensible of various %0amodifications from the slightest causes ; for not only, similarly %0ato the bile, does it rush upwards to the face, but it serves also %0ato indicate the various tendencies of the mind, by depicting %0ashame, anger, and fear, in many ways, either by the paleness %0aof the features or their unusual redness ; as, in fact, the red- %0aness of anger and the blush of modesty are quite different %0athings. It is a well-known fact, that when a man is in fear, %0athe blood takes to flight and disappears, and that many per- %0asons have been pierced through the body without losing one %0adrop of blood ; a thing, however, which is only the case with %0aman. But as to those animals which we have already men- %0ationed as changing'* colour, they derive that colour from the %0areflection'^ of other objects ; while, on the other hand, man is %0athe only one that has the elements which cause these changes %0acentred in himself. All diseases, as well as death, tend to %0aabsorb the blood. %0a%0aOHAP. 92. (39.) — WHETHER THE BLOOD IS THE PEINOIPLE OP %0a%0aLIFE. %0a%0aThere are some persons who are of opinion that the fineness %0aof the wit does not depend upon the thinness of the blood, but %0athat animals are more or less stupid in proportion to the skin %0aor other coverings of the body, as the oyster and the tortoise, %0afor instance : that the hide of the ox and the bristles of the hog, %0ain fact, ofler a resistance to the fine and penetrating powers of %0athe air, and leave no passage for its transmission in a pure %0aand liquid state. The same, they say, is the case, too, with %0amen, when the skin is very thick or callous, and so excludes %0athe air. Just as if, indeed, the crocodile was not equally re- %0amarkable for the hardness of its skin and its extreme cunning. %0a%0aCHAP. 93. THE HIDE OF ANIMALS. %0a%0aThe hide, too, of the hippopotamus is so thick, that lances," %0aeven, are turned from it, and yet this animal has the intelligence %0ato administer certain medicaments to itself. The hide, too, of %0a%0aThe polypus and the chameleon. %0aSee B. viii. cc. 51, 52. %0a16 Walking-sticks are still made of it. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 94.] %0a%0a%0a%0aTUE IIAiE; ETC. %0a%0a%0a%0a81 %0a%0a%0a%0athe elephant makes bucklers that are quite impenetrable, and %0ayet to it is ascribed a degree of intelligence superior to that of %0aany quadruped. The skin itself is entirely devoid of sen- %0asation, and more particularly that of the head ; wherever it %0ais found alone, and unaccompanied with flesh, if wounded, it %0awill not unite, as in the cheek and on the eyelid,'* for %0ainstance. %0a%0aCHAP. 94. THE HAIR AND THE COVERING OF THE SKIN. %0a%0aThose animals which are viviparous, have hair ; those which %0aare oviparous, have feathers, scales, or a shell, like the tor- %0atoise ; or else a purple skin, like the serpent. The lower part %0aof all feathers is hollow : if cut, they will not grow again, but if %0apulled out, they will shoot afresh. Insects fly by the aid of a %0afrail membrane ; the wings of the fish'" called the "swallow" are %0amoistened in the sea, while those of the bat which frequents %0aour houses are dry ; the wings of this last animal have certain %0aarticulations as well. The hairs that issue from a thick skin %0aare rough, while those on females are of a finer quality. Those %0afound on the horse's mane are more abundant, which is the %0acase also with the shoulders of the lion. The dasypus has %0ahair in the inside of the mouth even and under the feet, two %0afeatures Avhich Trogus has also attributed to the hare ; from %0aAvhich the same author concludes that hairy men are the most %0aprone to lust. The most hairy of all animals is the hare. %0aMan is the only creature that has hair as the mark of puberty ; %0aand a person who is devoid of this, whether male or female, %0ais sure to be sterile. The hair of man is partly born with %0ahim, and in part produced after his birth. The last kind of hair %0awill not grow upon eunuchs, though that which has been born %0awith thera does not fall ofl"; Avhich is the case also with %0awomen, in a great degree. Still however, there have been %0awomen known to be afflicted Avith falling off' of the hair, just %0aas some are to be seen with a fine down on the face, after the %0acessation of the menstrual discharge. In some men the hair %0athat mostly shoots forth after birth will not grow spontane- %0aously. The hair of quadrupeds comes off every year, and %0a%0a'■^ As ah-cadv mentioned, this is not the fact. %0a" See B. ix. c. 43. %0a%0aVOL. 111.

When cut, the hairs shoot, %0anot from the place Avhere they have been cut, as is the case %0awith grass, but at the root. The hair grows quickly in cer- %0atain diseases, phthisis more particularly ; it grows also with %0arapidity in old age, and on the body after death. In persons %0aof a libidinous tendency the hair that is produced at birth falls %0aoff more speedily, while that which is afterwards produced %0agrows with the greatest rapidity. In quadrupeds, the hair %0agrows thicker in old age ; but on those with wool, it becomes %0athinner. Those quadrupeds which have thick hair on the %0aback, have the belly quite smooth. From the hides of oxen, %0aand that of the bull more especially, glue is extracted by %0aboiling. %0a%0aCHAP. 95. THE PAPS : BIRDS THAT HAVE PAPS. EEMABKABLK %0a%0aFACTS CONNECTED WITH THE DUGS OF ANIMALS. %0a%0aMan is the only male among animals that has nipples, all %0athe rest having mere marks only in place of them. Among %0afemale animals even, the only ones that have mammae on the %0abreast are those which can nurture their young, l^o oviparous %0aanimal has mammae, and those only have milk that are vivi- %0aparous ; the bat being the only winged animal that has it. As %0afor the stories that they tell, about the screech-owl ejecting milk %0afrom its teats upon the lips of infants, I look upon it as utterly %0afabulous : from ancient times the name " strix,"^° I am aware, %0ahas been employed in maledictions, but I do not think it is %0awell ascertained what bird is really meant by that name. %0a%0a(40.) The female ass is troubled with pains in the teats %0aafter it has foaled, and it is for that reason that at the end of %0asix months it weans its young ; while the mare suckles its %0ayoung for nearly the whole year. The solid-hoofed animals %0ado not bear more than two young ones at a time : they all of %0athem have two paps, and nowhere but between the iiind legs. %0aAnimals with cloven feet and with horns, such as the cow, for %0ainstance, have four paps, similarly situate, sheep and goats two. %0a%0a20 It is not improbable that, under this name, some kind of large vam- %0apire bat was meant ; but, as Pliny says, it is impossible to arrive at any %0acertain knowledge on the subject. 'I'he best account given of the strix is %0athat in Ovid's Fasti, B. vi. The name was given opprobiously to supposed %0awitches, the "foul and midnight hags" of Shakspeare. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 96.] %0a%0a%0a%0aTHE MILK. %0a%0a%0a%0a83 %0a%0a%0a%0aTh ose which, produce a more nunierous progeny, and those %0awhich have toes on the feet, have a greater number of paps dis- %0atributed in a double row all along the belly, such as the %0asow, for instance ; the better sorts have twelve, the more %0acommon ones two less : the same is the case also with tlie %0afemale of the dog. Other animals, again, have four paps situate %0ain the middle of the belly, as the female panther; others, again, %0atwo only, as the lioness. The female elephant has two only, %0asituate between the shoulders, and those not in the breast, but %0awithout it, and hidden in the arm-pits : none of the animals %0awhich have toes have the paps between the hind legs. The sow %0apresents the first teat to the first-born in each farrow, the first %0ateat being the one that is situate nearest to the throat. Each %0apig, too, knows its own teat, according to the order in which %0ait was born, and drawls its nourishment from that and no other : %0aif its own suckling, too, should happen to be withdrawn from %0aany one of them, the pap will immediately dry up, and shrink %0aback within the belly : if there should be only one pig left %0aof all the farrow, that pap alone which has been assigned for %0aits nutriment Avhen born, will continue to hang down for the %0apurpose of giving suck. The she-bear has four mammte, the %0adolphin only two, at the bottom of the belly ; they are not %0aeasily visible, and have a somewhat oblique direction : this is %0athe only animal which gives suck while in motion. The baleena %0aand sea-calf also suckle their young by teats. %0a%0aCHAP. 96. (41.) — THE MILK : THE BIKSTINGS. CHEESE ; OF WHAT %0aMILK CHEESE CANNOT BE MADE. UENNET ; THE VAKXOUS KINDS %0aOF ALIMENT IN MILK. %0a%0aThe milk that is secreted in a woman before her seventh %0amonth is useless ; but after that month, so long as the foetus %0ais healthy, the milk is wholesome : many women, indeed, %0aare so full of milk, that it will flow not only from the mammfe, %0abut exudes at the arm-pits even.^^ Camels continue in milk %0auntil they are pregnant again. Their milk, mixed in the pro- %0aportion of one part to three of water, is considered a very %0apleasant beverage. The cow has no milk before it has calved, %0aand that which immediately follows upon its bringing forth is %0aknown as the " colostra : " " if water is not mixed with it, it will %0a%0aTliis assertion is borrowed from Aristotle, Hist.

She-asses, as %0asoon as they are pregnant, have milk in their udders ; when %0athe pastm-age is rich, it is fatal to their young to taste the %0amother's milk the first two days after birth ; the kind of %0amalady by which they are attacked is known by the name %0aof " colostration." Cheese cannot be made from the milk of %0aanimals which have teeth on either jaw, from the circumstance %0athat their milk does not coagulate. The thinnest milk of all %0ais that of the camel, and next to it that of the mare. The milk %0aof the she-ass is the richest of all, so much so, indeed, that it is %0aoften used instead of rennet. Asses' milk is also thought to %0abe very efficacious in whitening the skin of females : at all %0aevents, Poppaea,^^ the wife of Domitius Nero, used always to %0ahave with her five hundred asses with foal, and used to bathe %0athe whole of her body in their milk, thinking that it also con- %0aferred additional suppleness on the skin. All milk thickens %0aby the action of fire, and becomes serous when exposed to cold. %0aThe milk of the cow produces more cheese than that of the %0agoat : when equal in quantity, it will produce nearly twice the %0aweight. The milk of animals which have more than four %0amammte does not produce cheese ; and that is the best which is %0amade of the milk of those that have but two. The rennet of %0athe fawn, the hare, and the kid is the most esteemed, but the %0abest of all is that of the dasypus : this last acts as a specific %0afor diarrhoea, that animal being the only one with teeth in %0aboth jaws, the rennet of which has that property. It is a re- %0amarkable circumstance, that the barbarous nations which sub- %0asist on milk have been for so many ages either ignorant of the %0amerits of cheese, or else have totallj- disregarded it ; and yet %0athe)'" understand how to thicken milk and form therefrom an %0aacrid kind of liquid with a pleasant flavour, as well as a rich %0abutter : this last is the foam-* of milk, and is of a thicker con- %0asistency than the part which is known as the " serum." We %0aought not to omit that butter has certain of the properties of %0aoil, and that it is used for an ointment among all barbarous %0anations, and among ourselves as well, for infants. %0a%0a^ S*ee B. xxyiii. c. 12.

The pastures of the Alps %0arecommend themselves by two sorts of cheese ; the Dalmatic %0aAlps send us the Docleatian-* cheese, and the Centronian-* %0aAlps the Vatusican. The kinds produced in the Apennines are %0amore numerous ; from Liguria we have the cheese of Ceba,-* %0awhich is mostly made from the milk of sheep ; from Umbria %0awe have that of iEsina, and from the frontiers of Etruria and %0aLiguria those of Luna, remarkable for their vast size, a single %0acheese weighing as much as a thousand pounds. Nearer the %0aCity, again, we have the cheese of Vestinum, the best of this %0akind being that which comes from the territory of Cedi- %0atium.^' Goats also pi'oduce a cheese which has been of late %0aheld in the highest esteem, its flavour being heightened by %0asmoking it. The cheese of this kind which is made at Rome %0ais considered preferable to any other ; for that which is made %0ain Gaul has a strong taste, like that of medicine. Of the %0acheeses that are made beyond sea, that of Bithynia^^ is usually %0aconsidered the fii'st in quality. That salt exists in pasture- %0alands is pretty evident, from the fact that all cheese as it %0agrows old contracts a saltish flavour, even where it does not %0aappear to any great extent while at the same time it is %0aequally well known that cheese soaked in a mixture of thyme %0aand vinegar will regain its original fresh flavour.

THE FINGEES, THE AEMS. %0a%0aSome persons have six fingers on the hands. "We read that %0aC. Horatius, a man of patrician rank, had two daughters, who %0afor this reason had the name of " Sedigitaj and we find %0amention made of Volcatius Sedigitus,^* as a famous poet. %0aThe fingers of man have three joints, the thumb only two, %0ait bending in an opposite direction to all the other fingers. %0aViewed by itself, the movement of the thumb has a sidelong %0adirection, and it is much thicker than the rest of the fingers. %0aThe little finger is equal in length to the thumb, and two others %0aare also equal in length, the middle finger being the longest %0aof all. Those quadrupeds which live by rapine have five toes %0aon the fore feet, and four on the hinder ones. The lion, the %0awolf, and the dog, with some few others, have five claws %0aon the hind feet, one of which hangs down near the joint of the %0aleg. The other animals, also, which are of smaller size, have %0afive toes. The two arms are not always equal in length : it %0ais a well-known fact, that, in the school of gladiators belong- %0aing to Caius Cassar,^* the Thracian Studiosus had the right %0aarm longer than the left.

They have a thumb also, and %0aarticulations similar to those in man. The males differ from %0aman in the sexual parts only, while all the internal viscera %0aexactly resemble those of man. %0a%0aCHAP. 101. (45.) THE NAILS. %0a%0aIt is generally supposed that the nails are the terminations %0aof the sinews. All animals whicli have fingers luive nails us %0awell. In the ape they are long and overlapping,^'* like a tile, %0awhile in man they are broad : they will grow even after death. %0aIn the beasts of prey they are hooked, Avhile in others, such %0aas the dog, for instance, they are straight, with the exception, %0aindeed, of the one which is attached to the leg in most of %0athem. All the animals which have feet [and not hoots], have; %0atoes as well, except the elephant ; he, also, wouhl appear to %0ahave toes, five in number, but rudely developed, undivided, %0aand hardly distinct from one another, bearing a nearer resem- %0ablance, in fact, to hoofs than to claws. In the elephant the %0afore-feet are the largest, and in the hind-feet there are sliort %0ajoints. This animal is able, also, to bend the hams inward %0alike a man, while in all the others the joints of the hinder %0alegs bend in a contrary direction to those of the fore ones. %0aThose animals which are viviparous bend the fore-leg forward, %0awhile the joint of the hind-leg is directed backward, %0a%0aCHAP. 102.^ — THE KNEE^ AND THE HAMS. %0a%0aIn man the knee and the elbow bend contrary ways ; tho %0asame is the case, too, with the bear and the ape, and it is for %0athis reason that they are not so swift of foot as other ani- %0amals.

PARTS OF TnK HtniAN BODY TO WUICri CEItTAIX %0a%0aKELIGIOUS IDEAS ARE ATTACHED. %0a%0aIn accordance with the usages of various nations, certain %0areligious ideas have been attached to the knees. It is thu %0aknees that suppliants clasp, and it is to these that they extend %0atheir hands ; it is the knees that they worship like so many %0aaltars, as it were ; perhaps, because in them is centred the %0avital strength. For in the joint of eitlier knee, the right %0aas well as the left, there is on the fore-side of each a certain %0aempty space, which bears a strong resemblance to a mouth, and %0athrough which, like the throat, if it is once pierced, the vital %0apowers escape.^'' There are also certain religious ideas at- %0atached to other parts of che body, as is testified in raising tlie %0ahack of the right hand to the lips, and extending it as a token %0aof good faith. It was the custom of the ancient Greeks, when %0ain the act of supplication, to touch the chin. The seat of the %0amemorj' lies in the lower part of the ear, which we touch %0awhen we summon a witness to depose upon memory to an %0aarrest.''® The seat, too, of Xemesis^" lies behind the right ear, a %0agoddess which has never yet found a Latin name, no, not in tlio %0aCapitol even.

THE GAIT, THE FEET, THE LEGS. %0a%0aAll animals take a right-hand direction when they first %0abegin to walk, and lie down on the left side. While the other %0aanimals walk just as it may happen, the lion only and the %0acamel walk foot by foot, or in such a way that the left foot %0anever passes the right, but always comes behind it. Men have %0athe largest feet ; in every kind of animal the female has the %0asmallest. Man only" has calves, and flesh upon the legs : we %0afind it stated by authors, however, that there was once an %0aEgyptian who had no calves on his legs. All men, too, with %0asome few exceptions, have a sole to the foot. It is from these %0aexceptional cases that persons have obtained the names of %0aPlancus,'" Plautus, Punsa, and Scaurus ; just as, from the mal- %0aformation of the legs, we find persons called Varus,^^ Vacia, and %0aVatinius, all which blemishes are to be seen in quadrupeds %0aalso. Animals which have no horns have a solid hoof, from %0awhich circumstance it is used by them as a weapon of off'ence, %0ain place of horns ; such animals as these are also des- %0atitute of pastern bones, but those which have cloven hoofs %0ahave them ; w'hile those, again, which have toes have none, %0anor are they ever found iu the fore-feet of animals. The %0acamel has pastern bones like those of the ox, but somewhat %0asmaller, the feet being cloven, with a slight line of division, %0aand having a fleshy sole, like that of the bear : hence it is, %0athat in a long journey, the animal becomes fatigued, and the %0afoot cracks, if it is not shod. %0a%0aCHAP. lOG, (46.) HOOFS. %0a%0aThe horn of the hoof grows again in no animals except %0abeasts of burden. The swine in some places in lUyricum %0ahave solid hoofs. Nearly all the horned animals are cloven- %0afooted, no animal having solid hoofs and two horns. The %0aIndian ass is only a one-horned animal, and the oryx is both %0a%0aThe frog is, in some measure, an exception. %0a%0aOr "flat-foot," "splay-foot," "large-foot," and "club-footed." %0a%0aWords meaning " kuock-kneed," "bow-legged," and "wry-legged." %0a%0a%0a%0a90 %0a%0a%0a%0aPLlXl's KATDEAL niiSTOKY. %0a%0a%0a%0a[15ook XI. %0a%0a%0a%0aone-horned and cloven-footed. The Indian ass^' is the %0aonly solid-hoofed animal that has pastern-bones. As to %0aswine, they are looked upon as a sort of mongrel race, with a %0amixture of both kinds, and hence it is that their ankle-bones %0aare so misshapen. Those authors who have imagined that %0aman has similar pastern-bones, are easily to be confuted. The %0aIj-nx is the only one among the animals that have the feet %0adivided into toes, that has anything bearing a resemblance %0ato a pastern-bone ; while with the lion it is more crooked %0astill. The great pastern-bone is straight, and situate in the %0ajoints of the foot; it projects outwards in a convex protube- %0arance, and is held fast in its vertebration by certain liga- %0aments. %0a%0aCHAP. 107. (47.) THE FEET OF BIEDS. %0a%0aAmong birds, some have the feet divided into toes, while %0aothers, again, are broad and flatfooted — in others, which par- %0atake of the intermediate nature of both, the toes are divided, %0awith a wide space between them. All birds, however, have %0afour toes — three in front, and one on the heel ; this last, how- %0aever, is wanting in some that have long legs. The iynx*' is %0athe only bird that has two toes on each side of the leg. This %0abird also protrudes a long tongue similar to that of the serpent, %0aand it can turn the neck quite round and look backwards ; if %0ahas great talons, too, like those of the jackdaw. Some of the %0aheavier birds have spurs also upon the legs; but none of %0athose have them which have crooked talons as well. The %0along-footed birds, as they fly, extend the legs towards the tail, %0awhile those that have short legs hold them contracted close to %0athe middle of the body. Those authors who deny that there %0ais any bird without feet, assert that those even which are %0acalled apodes,^* are not without them, as also the oce, and the %0adrepanis,** which last is a bird but very rarely seen. Ser- %0apents, too, have been seen with feet like those of the goose. %0a%0aThe rhinoceros. %0a" Or wryneck. « See B. x. c. 5. %0a%0aSupposed to be the Hirundo apiisof Linnaeus.

THE FEET OF ANIMALS, FROM TTirSE HATING %0a%0aTWO FEET TO THOSE WITH A HUNDUED. DWAHFi. %0a%0aAmong insects, those which have hard eyes have the fore- %0afeet long, in order that from time to time they may rub the %0aeyes with their feet, as we frequently see done by flies. The %0ainsects which have long hind-feet are able to leap, the locust, %0afor instance. All these insects have six feet : and some of the %0aspiders have two very long feet in addition. They have, all %0aof them, three joints. We have already" stated that marine %0ainsects have eight feet, such as the polypus, the ssepia, the %0acuttle-fish, and the crab, animals which move their arms in a %0acontrary direction to their feet, which last they move around %0aas well as obliquely : they are the only animals the feet of %0awhich have a rounded form. Other insects have two feet to %0aregulate their movements ; in the crab, and in that only, these %0aduties are performed by four. The land animals which exceed %0athis number of feet, as most of the worms,*® never have fewer %0athan twelve feet, and some, indeed, as many as a hundred. %0aThe number of feet is never uneven in any animal. Among %0athe solid-hoofed animals, the legs are of their proper length %0afrom the moment of their birth, after which they may with %0amore propriety be said to extend themselves than to increase %0ain growth : hence it is, that in infancy they are able to scratch %0atheir ears with the hind feet, a thing which, when they grow %0aolder, they are not able to do, because their increase of growth %0aaffects only the superficies of the body. It is for the same %0areason also, that they are only able to graze at first by bending %0athe knees, until such time as the neck has attained its proper %0alength. %0a%0a(49.) There are dwarfs to be found among all animals, and %0aamong birds even. %0a%0aCHAP. 109. THE SEXTTAL PARTS. HERMAPHRODITES. %0a%0a"We have already spoken sufficiently** at length of those ani- %0amals, the males of which have the sexual parts behind. In %0athe wolf, the fox, the weasel, and the ferret, these parts are %0abony ; and it is the genitals of the last-mentioned animal %0a%0aB. ix. c. 44. %0a%0a*8 He evidently means insects of the centipede class.

It is said also that the genitals of the bear are %0aturned into a hornT substance the moment it dies. Among %0athe peoples of the East the very best bow-strings are those %0awhich are made of the member of the camel. These parts also, %0aamong different nations, are made the object of certain usages'" %0aand religious observances ; and the Galli/^ the priests of the %0aMother of the gods, are in the habit of castrating themselves, %0awithout any dangerous results. On the other hand, there is %0ain some few w^omen a monstrous resemblance to the male con- %0aformation, while hermaphrodites appear to partake of the %0anature of both. Instances of this last conformation were %0aseen in quadrupeds in Nero's reign, and for the first time, I %0aimagine ; for he ostentatiously paraded hermaphrodite horses %0ayoked to his car, which had been found in the territory of %0athe Treviri, in Gaul ; as if, indeed, it was so remarkably fine a %0asight to behold the ruler of the earth seated in a chariot dra^^-n %0aby monstrosities ! %0a%0aCHAP. 110. — rnE TESTES — THE THKEE CLASSES OP EUNUCHS. %0a%0aIn sheep and cattle the testes hang down to the legs, while %0ain the boar they are knit up close to the body. In the dolphin %0athey are very long, and are concealed in the lower part of the %0abelly. In the elephant, also, they are quite concealed. In %0aoviparous animals they adhere to the interior of the loins: %0athese animals are the most speedy in the venereal congress. %0aFishes and serpents have no testes, but in place of them they %0ahave two-veins, which run from the renal region to the genitals. %0aThe bird known as the " buteo,"*^ has three testes. Man is %0athe only creature in which the testes are ever broken, either %0aaccidentally or by some natural malady ; those -who are thus %0aafflicted form a third class of half men, in addition to her- %0amaphrodites and eunuchs. In all species of animals the male %0ais more courageous than the female, with the exception of the %0apanther and the bear. %0a%0aCHAP. 111. (50.)

In animals with bristles %0athe tail is bare, as in the boar, for instance. In those that are %0ashaggy, it is small, such as the bear ; while in those animals %0athat have long hair, the tail is long also, the horse, for in- %0astance. The tail of a lizard or serpent, if cut off, wall grow %0aagain. The tail governs the movements of the fish like a %0arudder, and turning from side to side, to the right or to the %0aleft, impels it onwards, acting in some degree like an oar. %0aA double tail is sometimes found in lizards. In oxen, the %0astalk of the tail is of remarkable length, and is covered with %0arough hair at the extremitj-. In the ass, too, it is longer than %0ain the horse, but in beasts of burden it is covered with bristly %0ahairs. The tail of the lion, at the extremity, is like that of %0athe ox and the field-mouse ; but this is not the case with the %0apanther. In the fox and the wolf it is covered with long %0aluiir, as in sheep, in w^hich it is longer also. In swine, the %0atail is curled ; among dogs, those that are mongrels carry it %0aclose beneath the belly. %0a%0aCHAP. 112. (51.) — THE DIFFERENT VOICES OF ANIMALS. %0a%0aAristotle^- is of opinion that no animal has a voice which %0adoes not respire, and that hence it is that there is no voice in %0ainsects, but only a noise, through the circulation of the air in %0athe interior, and its resounding, by reason of its compression. %0a8ome insects, again, he says, emit a sort of humming noise, %0asuch as the bee, for instance ; others a shrill, long-drawn note, %0alike the grasshopper, the two cavities beneath the thorax re- %0aceiving the air, which, meeting a moveable membrane within, %0aemits a sound by the attrition. — Also that flies, bees, and %0aother insects of that nature, are only heard while they are %0aflying, and cease to be heard the moment they settle, and that %0athe sound which they emit proceeds from the friction and the %0aair within them, and not from any act of respiration. At all %0aevents, it is generally believed that the locust emits a sound %0aby rubbing together the wdngs and thighs, and that among %0athe aquatic animals the scallop makes a certain noise as it %0aflies.** Mollusks, however, and the testaceous animals have no %0avoice and emit no sounds. As for the other fishes, although %0a%0a%0a%0a" Hist. Anim.

The tish, too, that %0ais found in the river Acheloiis, and is known as the boar-fish," %0amakes a grunting noise, as do some others which we have pre- %0aviously** mentioned. The oviparous animals hiss: in the %0aserpent this hissing is prolonged, in the tortoise it is short and %0aabrupt. Frogs make a peculiar noise of their own, as already %0astated;^ unless, indeed, this, too, is to be looked upon as a %0amatter of doubt ; but their noise originates in the mouth, and %0anot in the thorax. Still, however, in reference to this subject, %0athe nature of the various localities exercises a very considerable %0ainfluence, for in Macedonia, it is said, the frogs are dumb, and %0athe same in reference to the wild boars there. Among birds, %0athe smaller ones chirp and twitter the most, and more espe- %0acially about the time of pairing. Others, again, exercise their %0avoice while figliting, the quail, for instance ; others before %0athey begin to fight, such as the partridge ; and others M'hen %0athey have gained the victory, the dunghill cock, for instance, %0aThe males in these species have a peculiar note of their own, %0awhile in others, the nightingale for example, the male has %0athe same note as the female. %0a%0aSome birds sing all the year round, others only at certain %0atimes of the year, as we have already mentioned when speak- %0aing of them individually. The elephant produces a noise %0asimilar to that of sneezing, by the aid of the mouth, and in- %0adependently of the nostrils ; but by means of the nostrils it %0aemits a sound similar to the hoarse braying of a trumpet %0aIt is only in the bovine race that the voice of the female is the %0adeepest, it being in all other kinds of animals more shrill than %0athat of the male ; it is the same also with the male of the %0ahuman race when castrated. The infant at its birth is never %0aheard to utter a cry before it has entirely left the uterus: %0ait begins to speak at the end of the first year. A son of %0aCroesus," however, spoke when only six months old, and, while %0ayet wielding the child's rattle, afforded portentous omens, for %0a%0a5* "Aper." 65 B. ix. c. 7. %0a%0a6s See c. 65 of the present Book. %0a%0a*' Not the diimh son mentioned by Herodotus, who saved his father's %0alife at the taking of Sardes. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 113.] %0a%0a%0a%0aSUPEKFI.UOUS LIMBS. %0a%0a%0a%0a95 %0a%0a%0a%0ait was at the same period that his father's empire fell. Those %0achildren which begin to speak the soonest, begin to walk the %0alatest. The human voice acquires additional strength at the %0afourteenth year ; but in old age it becomes more shrill again, %0aand there is no living creature in which it is subject to more %0afrequent changes. %0a%0aIn addition to the preceding, there are still some singular %0acircumstances that deserve to be mentioned with reference to %0athe voice. If saw-dust or sand is thrown down in the orches- %0atra of a theatre, or if the walls around are left in a rough %0astate, or empty casks are placed there, the voice is absorbed ; %0awhile, on the other hand, if the wall is quite straight, or if %0abuilt in a concave fonn, tlie voice will move along it, and will %0aconvey words spoken in the slightest whisper from one %0aend*^ to the other, if there is no inequality in the surface to %0aimpede its progress. The voice, in man, contributes in a great %0adegree to form his physiognomy, for we form a knowledge of %0aa man before we see him by hearing his voice, just as well^ %0aas if we had seen him with our eyes. There are as many %0akinds of voices, too, as there are individuals in existence, and %0aeach man has his own peculiar voice, just as much as his own %0apeculiar physiognomy. Hence it is, that arises that vast di- %0aversity of nations and languages throughout the whole earth : %0ain this, too, originate the many tunes, measures, and inflexions %0athat exist. But, before all other things, it is the voice that %0aserves to express our sentiments,'^" a power that distinguishes %0aus from the beasts ; just as, in the same way, the various shades %0aand differences in language that exist among men have created %0aan equally marked difference between us and the brutes. %0a%0aCHAP. 113.

Al- %0athough I am quite convinced of the utter futility of these re- %0amarks, and am of opinion that they ouglit not to he published %0a-without hesitation, for fear lest each person might be anxiouslj' %0alooking out for these prognostics in his own person, I shall still %0amake some slight mention of the subject, seeing that so learned %0aa man as Aristotle did not treat it with contempt. He has set %0adown the following as indications of a short life — few teeth, %0avery long fingers, a leaden colour, and numerous broken lines %0ain the palm of the hand. On the other hand, he looks upon the %0afollowing as prognostics of a long life — stooping in the shoul- %0aders, one or two long unbroken lines in the hand, a greater num- %0aber than two-and-thirtj' teeth, and large ears . He does not, I %0aimagine, require that all these sj^mptoms should unite in one %0aperson, but looks upon them as individuallj^ significant : in my %0aopinion, however, they are utterlj^ frivolous, all of them, al- %0athough they obtain currency among the vulgar. Our own writer, %0aTrogus, has in a similar manner set down the physiognomy as %0aindicative of the moral disposition ; one of the very gravest of %0athe Roman authors, whose own*" words I will here subjoin:— %0a%0a" Where the forehead is broad, it is significant of a dull and %0asluggish understanding beneath ; and where it is small, it in- %0adicates an unsteady disposition. A rounded forehead denotes %0aan irascible temper, it seeming as though the swelling anger %0ahad left its traces there. Where the eye-brows are extended %0ain one straight line, they denote effeminacy in ihe owner, and %0awhen they are bent downwards towards the nose, an austere %0adisposition. On the other hand, when the eye-brows are bent %0atowards the temples, they are indicative of a sarcastic dispo- %0asition ; but when they lie very low, thcj denote malice and %0aenvy. Long eyes are significant of a spiteful, malicious nature; %0aand where the corners of the eyes next the nose are fleshy, it %0ais a sign also of a wicked disposition. If the white of the eye %0ais large, it bears tokens of impudence, while those who are %0aincessantly closing the ej'elids are inconstant.

Thus much %0aof what Trogus says. %0a%0aCHAP. 115, (53.) — RESPIRATION AND NUTRIMENT. %0a%0aThe hreath of the lion is fetid, and that of the bear quite %0apestilential ; indeed, no beast will touch anything with Avhich %0aits breath has come in contact, and substances which it has %0abreathed upon will become putrid sooner than others. It is %0ain man only that Nature has willed that the breath should %0abecome tainted in several ways, either through faultiness in %0athe victuals or the teeth, or else, as is more generally the case, %0athrough extreme old age. Our breath in itself was insensible %0ato all pain, utterly devoid as it was of all powers of touch and %0afeeling, without which there can be no sensation ; ever re- %0anewed, it was always forthcoming, destined to be the last ad- %0ajunct that shall leave the body, and the only one to remain %0awhen aU is gone beside ; it drew, in fine, its origin from, %0aheaven. In spite of all this, however, certain penalties were %0adiscovered to be inflicted upon it, so that the very substance %0aby the aid of which we live might become a torment to us in %0alife. This inconvenience is more particularly experienced %0aamong the Partliians, from their youth upwards, on account %0aof the indiscriminate use of food among them ; and, indeed, %0atheir very excess in wine causes their breath to be fetid. The %0agrandees, however, of that nation have a remedy for bad breath %0ain the pips of the Assyrian citron,^- which they mix with their %0afood, and the aroma of which is particularly agreeable. The %0abreath of the elephant will attract serpents from their holes, %0awhile that of the stag scorches them. We have already made %0amention*^ of certain races of men who could by suction extract %0afrom the body the venom of serpents ; and swine will even eat %0aserpents,*^ which to other animals are poisonous.

ANIMALS WHICH WHEN FED UPON POISON Do %0a%0aNOT DIE, AND THE FLESH OF WHICH IS POISONOUS. %0a%0aThe animals which feed upon poison have been already" %0amentioned. Some of them, which are harmless of themselves, %0abecome noxious if fed upon venomous substances. The wild %0aboar of Pamphylia and the mountainous parts of Cilicia, after %0ahaving devoured a salamander, will become poisonous to those %0awho eat its flesh ; and yet the danger is quite imperceptible %0aby reason of any peculiarity in the smell and taste. The sala- %0amander, too, will poison either water or wine, in which it %0ahappens to be drowned ; and what is more, if it has only drunk %0athereof, the liquid becomes poisonous. The same is the case, %0atoo, with the frog known to us as the bramble-frog. So nu- %0amerous are the snares that are laid in wait for life ! Wasps %0agreedily devour the flesh of the serpent, a nutriment which %0arenders their stings fatal ; so vast is the diflerence to be found %0abetween one kind of food and another. In the country, too, %0aof the Ichthyophagi,^' as we learn from Theophrastus, the oxen %0aare fed upon fish, but only when alive. %0a%0aCHAP. 117. — REASONS FOR INDIGESTION. REMEDIES FOB %0aCRUDITY. %0a%0aThe most wholesome nutriment for man is plain food. An %0aaccumulation of flavours is injurious, and still more so, if %0aheightened by sauces. All acrid elements are difiicult of di- %0agestion, and the same is the case if food is devoured greedily, %0aor in too large quantities. Food is also less easily digested in %0asummer than in winter, and in old age than in youth. The %0avomits which man has invented, by way of remedy for this %0aevil, render the body more cold, and are more particularly inju- %0arious to the eyes and teeth. %0a%0aCHAP. 118. FROM WHAT CAUSES CORPULENCE ARISES; %0a%0aHOW IT MAY BE REDUCED. %0a%0aDigestion during sleep is more productive of corpulence than %0astrength.

Watching, at night more es- %0apecially, promotes digestion of the food. %0a%0a(54.) The size of the body is increased by eating sweet and %0afatty substances, as well as by drinking, while, on the other %0ahand, it is diminished by eating dry, acrid, or cold substances, %0aand by abstaining from drink. Some animals of Africa, as %0awell as sheep, drink but once every four days. Abstinence %0afrom food for seven days, even, is not of necessity fatal to man ; %0aand it is a well-known fact, that many persons have not died till %0aafter an abstinence of eleven days. Man is the only animal %0athat is ever attacked with an insatiate^ craving for food. %0a%0aCHAP. 119. — WHAT THINGS,- BT MEHELY TASTING OF THEM, %0aALLAY HtJNGEE AND THIEST. %0a%0aOn the other hand, there are some substances which, tasted %0ain small quantities only, appease hunger and thirst, and keen %0aup the strength, such as butter, for instance, cheese made of %0amares' milk, and liquorice. But the most pernicious thing of %0aall, and in every station of life, is excess, and more especially %0aexcess in food ; in fact, it is the most prudent plan to re- %0atrench everything that may be possibly productive of injury. %0aLet us, however, now pass on to the other branches of Nature. %0a%0aSuMMAEY. — Remarkable facts, narratives, and observations, %0atwo thousand, two hundred, and seventy. %0a%0aEoMAN AUTHORS QUOTED. — M.

(1.) THE EXTREME SMALLNESS OF INSECTS. %0a%3c %0a%3c We shall now proceed to a description of the insects, a %0a%3c subject replete with endless difficulties ;^ for, in fact, there %0a%3c are some authors who have maintained that they do not respire, %0a%3c and that they are destitute of blood. The insects are numerous, %0a%3c and form many species, and their mode of life is like that of %0a%3c the terrestrial animals and the birds. Some of them are fur- %0a%3c nished with wings, bees for instance ; others are divided into %0a%3c those kinds which have wings, and those which are without %0a%3c them, such as ants ; while others, again, are destitute of both %0a%3c wings and feet. All these animals have been very properly %0a%3c called "insects,"^ from the incisures or divisions which sepa- %0a%3c rate the body, sometimes at the neck, and sometimes at the %0a%3c corselet, and so divide it into members or segments, only %0a%3c united to each other by a slender tube. In some insects, how- %0a%3c ever, this division is not complete, as it is surrounded by %0a%3c wrinkled folds ; and thus the flexible vertebrae of the creature, %0a%3c whether situate at the abdomen, or whether only at the upper %0a%3c part of the body, are protected by layers, overlapping each %0a%3c other ; indeed, in no one of her works has Nature more fully %0a%3c displayed her exhaustless ingenuity. %0a%3c %0a%3c (2.) In large animals, on the other hand, or, at all events, %0a%3c %0a%3c ' " Immensifi subtilitatis." As Cuvier remarks, the ancients have com- %0a%3c mitted more errors in reference to the insects, than to any other portion of %0a%3c the animal world. The discovery of the microscope has served more than %0a%3c anything to correct these erroneous notions. %0a%3c %0a%3c * " Insecta," "articulated." %0a%3c %0a%3c VOL. 111.

Where is it that she has %0a%3c united so many senses as in the gnat ? — not to speak of creatures %0a%3c that might be mentioned of still smaller size — Where, I say, %0a%3c has she found room to place in it the organs of sight ? Where %0a%3c has she centred the sense of taste ? Where has she inserted %0a%3c the power of smell ? And where, too, has she implanted that %0a%3c sharp shrill voice of the creature, so utterly disproportioned to %0a%3c the smallness of its body ? With what astonishing subtlety %0a%3c has she united the wings to the trunk, elongated the joints %0a%3c of the legs, framed that long, craving concavity for a belly, and %0a%3c then inflamed the animal with an insatiate thirst for blood, %0a%3c that of man more especially! What ingenuity has she displayed %0a%3c in providing it with a sting,^ so well adapted for piercing the %0a%3c skin! And then too, just as though she had had the most %0a%3c extensive field for the exercise of her skill, although the %0a%3c weapon is so minute that it can hardly be seen, she has formed %0a%3c it with a twofold mechanism, providing it with a point for the %0a%3c purpose of piercing, and at the same moment making it hollow, %0a%3c to adapt it for suction. %0a%3c %0a%3c What teeth, too, has she inserted in the teredo,* to adapt it %0a%3c for piercing oak even with a sound which fully attests their %0a%3c destructive power ! while at the same time she has made wood %0a%3c its principal nutriment. We give all our admiration to the %0a%3c shoulders of the elephant as it supports the turret, to the %0a%3c stalwart neck of the bull, and the might with which it hurls %0a%3c aloft whatever comes in its way, to the onsknight of the tiger, %0a%3c or to the mane of the lion ; while, at the same tluiu, Nature is %0a%3c nowhere to be seen to greater perfection than in the very %0a%3c smallest of her works. For this reason then, I must beg of %0a%3c my readers, notwithstanding tlie contempt they feel for many %0a%3c of these objects, not to feel a similar disdain for the informa- %0a%3c tion I am about to give relative thereto, seeing that, in the %0a%3c %0a%3c ^ The trunk of the gnat, Cuvier says, contains five silken and pointed %0a%3c threads, vrhich together have the effect of a sting. %0a%3c %0a%3c * The Teredo navalis of Linnaeus, not an insect, but one of the mollusks. %0a%3c This is the same creature that is mentioned in B. xvi. c. 80 ; but that spoken %0a%3c of in B. viii. c. 74, must have been a laud insect. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 2.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c INSECTS. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 3 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c study of 2^ature, there are none of her works that are unworthy %0a%3c of our consideration. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 2. (3.) WHETHEE INSECTS RESPIRE, AND WHETHER %0a%3c %0a%3c THEY HAVE BLOOD. %0a%3c %0a%3c Many authors deny that insects respire,^ and make the %0a%3c assertion upon the ground, that in their viscera there is no %0a%3c respiratory organ to be found. On this ground, they assert %0a%3c that insects liave the same kind of life as plants and trees, %0a%3c there being a very great difference between respiring and merely %0a%3c having life. On similar grounds also, thej assert that insects %0a%3c have no blood, a thiug which cannot exist, they say, in any %0a%3c animal that is destitute of heart and liver ; just as, according %0a%3c to them, those creatures cannot breathe which have no lungs. %0a%3c Upon these points, however, a vast number of questions will %0a%3c naturally arise ; for the same writers do not hesitate to deny %0a%3c that these creatures are destitute also of voice,* and this, %0a%3c notwithstanding the humming of bees, the chirping of grass- %0a%3c hoppers, and the sounds emitted by numerous other insects %0a%3c M'liich will be considered in their respective places. For my %0a%3c part, whenever I have considered the subject, I have ever felt %0a%3c persuaded that there is nothing impossible to Nature, nor do I %0a%3c see why creatures should be less able to live and yet not %0a%3c inhale, than to respire without being possessed of viscera, a %0a%3c doctrine which I have already maintained, when speaking' of %0a%3c the marine animals ; and that, notwithstanding the density %0a%3c and the vast depth of the water which would appear to impede %0a%3c all breathing, j; o ,'.']i;it person could very easily believe that %0a%3c there can be any iirvdii-^s that fly to and fro, and live in the %0a%3c very midst of the c.i^n\Q:. (• uf respiration, Avhile, at the same time, %0a%3c they themselves are devoid of that respiration ; that they can %0a%3c be possessed of the requisite instincts for nourishment, gene- %0a%3c ration, working, and making provision even for time to come, %0a%3c in the enjoyment too (although, certainly, they are not pos- %0a%3c sessed of the organs which act, as it were, as the receptacles %0a%3c %0a%3c * They respire by orifices in the sides of the body, known to naturalists %0a%3c as stigmata.

That these creatures have no blood « %0a%3c I am ready to admit, just as all the terrestrial animals are not %0a%3c possessed of it ; but then, they have something similar, by way %0a%3c of equivalent. Just as in the sea, the s£epia^ has a black %0a%3c liquid in place of blood, and the various kinds of purples, those %0a%3c juices which we use for the purposes of dyeing ; so, too, is every %0a%3c insect possessed of its own vital humour, which, whatever it %0a%3c is, is blood to it. "While I leave it to others to form what %0a%3c opinion they please on this subject, it is my purpose to set %0a%3c forth the operations of Nature in the clearest possible light, %0a%3c and not to enter upon the discussion of points that are replete %0a%3c with doubt. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 3. (4.) — THE BODIES OF INSECTS. %0a%3c %0a%3c Insects, 80 far as I find myself able to ascertain, seem to %0a%3c have neither sinews,'" bones, spines, cartilages, fat, nor flesh ; %0a%3c nor yet so much as a frail shell, like some of the marine ani- %0a%3c mals, nor even anything that can with any propriety be %0a%3c termed skin ; but they have a body which is of a kind of inter- %0a%3c mediate nature between all these, of an arid substance, softer %0a%3c than muscle, and in other respects of a natixre that may, in %0a%3c strictness, be rather pronounced yielding," than hard. Such, %0a%3c then, is all that they are, and nothing more : in the inside %0a%3c of their bodies there is nothing, except in some few, which %0a%3c have an intestine arranged in folds. Hence it is, that even %0a%3c when cut asunder, they are remarkable for their tenacity of %0a%3c life, and the palpitations which are to be seen in each of their %0a%3c parts. For every portion of them is possessed of its own %0a%3c vital principle, which is centred in no limb in particular, but %0a%3c %0a%3c * Cuvier remarks, that they have a nourishing fluid, which is of a white %0a%3c colour, and acts in place of hlood. %0a%3c %0a%3c The dye of stepia, Cuvier remarks, is not blood, nor does it act as such, %0a%3c being an excrementitious liquid. It has in addition a bluish, transparent, %0a%3c blood. The same also with the juices of the purple. %0a%3c %0a%3c 10 "Nervos." Cuvier says that all insects have a brain, a sort of spinal %0a%3c marrow, and nerves. %0a%3c %0a%3c u "Tutius." %0a%3c %0a%3c '2 Insects have no fat, Cuvier says, except when in the chrysahs state ; %0a%3c but they have a fibrous flesh of a whitisb colour. They have also viscera, %0a%3c trachea, nerves, and a most complicated organization. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 5.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BEES. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 5 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c in every part of the body ; least of all, however, in the head, %0a%3c which alone is subject to no movements unless torn off together %0a%3c with the corselet. No kind of animal has more feet than the %0a%3c insects have, and those among them which have the most, live %0a%3c the longest when cut asunder, as we see in the case of the scolo- %0a%3c pendra. They have eyes, and the senses as well of touch and %0a%3c taste ; some of them have also the sense of smelling, and some %0a%3c few that of hearing. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 4. (5.) BEES. %0a%3c %0a%3c But among them all, the first rank, and our especial admi- %0a%3c ration, ought, in justice, to be accorded to bees, which alone, %0a%3c of all the insects, have been created for the benefit of man. %0a%3c They extract honey and collect it, a juicy substance remarkable %0a%3c for its extreme sweetness, lightness, and wholesomeness. They %0a%3c form their combs and collect wax, an article that is useful for %0a%3c a thousand purposes of life ; thej^ are patient of fatigue, toil at %0a%3c their labours, form themselves into political communities, hold %0a%3c councils together in private, elect chiefs in common, and, a thing %0a%3c that is the most remarkable of all, have their own code of morals. %0a%3c In addition to this, being as they are, neither tame nor wild, %0a%3c 80 all-powerful is Nature, that, from a creature so minute as to %0a%3c be nothing more hardly than the shadow of an animal, she has %0a%3c created a marvel beyond all comparison. What muscular %0a%3c power, what exertion of strength are we to put in comparison %0a%3c with such vast energy and such industry as theirs ? What dis- %0a%3c play of human genius, in a word, shaJl we compare with the %0a%3c reasoning powers manifested by them ? In this they have, at %0a%3c all events, the advantage of us — they know of nothing but what %0a%3c is for the common benefit of all. Away, then, with all questions %0a%3c whether they respire or no, and let us be ready to agree on %0a%3c the question of their blood ; and yet, how little of it can pos- %0a%3c sibly exist in bodies so minute as theirs. — And now let us %0a%3c form some idea of the instinct they display. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 5. (6.) THE OEDEE DISPLAYED IN THE WORKS OP BEES. %0a%3c %0a%3c Bees keep within the hive during the winter — for whence %0a%3c are they to derive the strength requisite to withstand frosts %0a%3c and snows, and the northern blasts ? The same, in fact, is %0a%3c done by all insects, but not to so late a period; as those %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 6 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c PLINY'S NATTJEAL HISTOET. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XL %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c which conceal themselves in the walls of our houses, are much %0a%3c sooner sensible of the returning warmth. With reference to %0a%3c bees, either seasons and climates have considerably changed, or %0a%3c else former writers have been greatly mistaken. They retire %0a%3c for the winter at the setting of the Vcrgilise, and remain shut %0a%3c up till after the rising of that constellation, and not till only %0a%3c the beginning of spring, as some authors have stated ; nor, in- %0a%3c deed, does any one in Italy ever think of then opening the hives. %0a%3c They do not come forth to ply their labours until the bean %0a%3c blossoms ; and then not a day do they lose in inactivity, while %0a%3c the weather is favourable for their pursuits. %0a%3c %0a%3c First of all, they set about constructing their combs, and %0a%3c forming the wax, or, in other words, making their dwellings %0a%3c and cells ; after this they produce their young, and then make %0a%3c honey and wax from flowers, and extract bee-glue'^ from the %0a%3c tears of those trees which distil glutinous substances, the %0a%3c juices, gums, and resins, namely, of the willow, the elm, and %0a%3c the reed. With these substances, as well as others of a more %0a%3c bitter nature, they first line the whole inside of the hive, as a %0a%3c sort of protection against the greedy propensities of other small %0a%3c insects, as they are well aware that they are about to form %0a%3c that which will prove an object of attraction to them.

PERSONS AVHO HAVK MADE BEES THElll STUDY. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is not surprising that there have been persons who have %0a%3c made bees their exclusive study ; Aristomachus of Soli, for %0a%3c instance, who for a period of fifty-eight years did nothing else ; %0a%3c Philiscus of Thasos, also, surnamed Agrius,^^ who passed his %0a%3c life in desert spots, tending swarms of bees. Both of these %0a%3c have written works on this subject. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 10. (10.) THE MODE IN WHICH BEES WORK. %0a%3c %0a%3c The manner in which bees carry on their work is as follows. %0a%3c In the day time a guard is stationed at the entrance of the %0a%3c hive, like the sentries in a camp. At night they take their %0a%3c rest until the morning, when one of them awakes the rest vdth. %0a%3c a humming noise, repeated twice or thrice, just as though it were %0a%3c sounding a trumpet. They then take their flight in a body, %0a%3c if the day is likely to turn out fine ; for they have the gift of %0a%3c foreknowing wind and rain, and in such case will keep close %0a%3c within their dwellings. On the other hand, when the weather is %0a%3c fine — and this, too, they have the power of foreknowing — the %0a%3c Bwarm issues forth, and at once applies itself to its work, some %0a%3c loading their legs from the flowers, while others fill their %0a%3c mouths with Avater, and charge the downy surface of their %0a%3c bodies with drops of liquid. Those among them that are %0a%3c young go forth to their labours, and collect the materials %0a%3c already mentioned, while those that are more aged stay within %0a%3c the hives and work. The bees whose business it is to cany %0a%3c the flowers, with their fore feet load their thighs, which Nature %0a%3c has made rough for the purpose, and Avith their trunks load %0a%3c %0a%3c 2* Or, the "wild man." %0a%3c %0a%3c 22 Huber has discovered that there are two kinds of bees of neutral sex, %0a%3c or, as he calls them, unprolific females, tlie workers, which so out, and %0a%3c the nurses, which are smaller, and stay in the hive to tend the larvje. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Cbap. 10.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BEES. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 9 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c their fore feet : bending beneath their load, they then return %0a%3c to the hive, where there are three or four bees ready to receive %0a%3c them and aid in discharging their burdens. For, within the %0a%3c hive as well, they have their allotted duties to perform : some %0a%3c are engaged in building, others in. smoothing, the combs, while %0a%3c others again are occupied in passing on the materials, and %0a%3c others in preparing food'-^ from the provision which has been %0a%3c bi'ought ; that there may be no unequal division, either in their %0a%3c labour, their food, or the distribution of their time, they do not %0a%3c even feed separately. %0a%3c %0a%3c Commencing at the vaulted roof of the hive, they begin %0a%3c the construction of their cells, and, just as we do in the manu- %0a%3c facture of a web, they construct their cells from top to bottom, %0a%3c taking care to leave two passages around each compartment, %0a%3c for the entrance of some and the exit of others. The combs, %0a%3c which are fastened to the hive in the upper part, and in a %0a%3c slight degree also at the sides, adhere to each other, and are %0a%3c thus suspended altogether. They do not touch the floor of the %0a%3c hive, and are either angular or round, according to its shape ; %0a%3c sometimes, in fact, they are both angular and round at once, %0a%3c when two swarms are living in unison, but have dissimilar %0a%3c modes of operation. They prop up the combs that are likely %0a%3c to fall, bj' means of arched pillars, at intervals springing from %0a%3c the floor, so as to leave them a passage . for the purpose of %0a%3c eflccting repairs. The first three ranks of their cells are gene- %0a%3c rally left empty Avhen constructed, that there may be nothing %0a%3c exposed to view which may invite theft ; and it is the last %0a%3c ones, more especially, that are filled with honey : hence %0a%3c it is that the combs are always taken out at the back of the %0a%3c hive. %0a%3c %0a%3c The bees that are employed in carrying look out for a favour- %0a%3c able breeze, and if a gale should happen to spring up, they %0a%3c poise themselves in the air with little stones, by way of bal- %0a%3c last ; some writers, indeed, say that they place them upon their %0a%3c shoulders. When the wind is contrary, they fly close to the %0a%3c ground, taking care, however, to keep clear of the brambles. %0a%3c It is wonderful what strict watch is kept upon their work : all %0a%3c instances of idleness are carefully remarked, the offenders are %0a%3c %0a%3c From the honey found in the corolla; of flowers. This, after heing %0a%3c prepared in the first stomach of the bee, is deposited in the cell which is %0a%3c formed for its reception. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 10 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c PLIirr's NATUEAL HISTOET. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XL %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c chastised, and on a repetition of the fault, punished with death. %0a%3c Their sense of cleanliness, too, is quite extraordinary ; everj^- %0a%3c thing is removed that might he in the way, and no filth is %0a%3c allowed to remain in the midst of their work. The ordure %0a%3c even of those that are at work within, that they may not have %0a%3c to retire to any distance, is all collected in one spot, and on %0a%3c stormy days, when they are obliged to cease their ordinary %0a%3c labours, they employ themselves in carrj-ing it out. When %0a%3c it grows towards evening, the buzzing in the hive becomes %0a%3c gi-adually less and less, until at last one of their number is to %0a%3c be seen fiying about the hive with the same loud humming %0a%3c noise with which they were aroused in the morning, there- %0a%3c by giving the signal, as it were, to retire to rest : in this, too, %0a%3c they imitate the usage of the camp. The moment the signal %0a%3c is heard, aU is silent. %0a%3c %0a%3c (11.) They first construct the dwellings of the commonalty, %0a%3c and then those of the king-bee. If they have reason to expect %0a%3c an abundant ^ season, they add abodes also for the drones : %0a%3c these are ceUs of a smaller size, though the drones themselves %0a%3c are larger than the bees. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 11. — DEONES. %0a%3c %0a%3c The drones have no sting,-* and would seem to be a kind of %0a%3c imperfect bee, formed the very last of all ; the expiring effort, %0a%3c as it were, of worn-out and exhausted old age, a late and tardy %0a%3c ofi'spring, and doomed, in a measure, to be the slaves of the %0a%3c genuine bees. Hence it is that the bees exercise over them a %0a%3c rigorous authority, compel them to take the foremost rank in %0a%3c their labours, and if they show any sluggishness, punish them*' %0a%3c without mercy. And not only in their labours do the drones %0a%3c give them their assistance, but in the propagation of their spe- %0a%3c cies as well, the very multitude of them contributing greatly %0a%3c to the warmth of the hive.

When fhe %0a%3c honey is beginning to come to maturity, the bees drive away %0a%3c the drones, and setting upon each in great numbers, put them %0a%3c all to death. It is only in the spring that the drones are %0a%3c ever to be seen. If you deprive a drone of its wings, and then %0a%3c replace it in the hive, it will pull off the wings of the other %0a%3c drones. %0a%3c %0a%3c CH.\P. 12, — THE QtrALITIES OF HOITEY. %0a%3c %0a%3c In the lower part of the hive they construct for their future %0a%3c sovereign a palatial abode,-'' spacious and grand, separated from %0a%3c the rest, and surmounted by a sort of dome : if this promi- %0a%3c nence should happen to be flattened, all hopes of progeny- are %0a%3c lost. All the cells are hexagonal, each foot^" having formed %0a%3c its own side. No part of this work, however, is done at any %0a%3c stated time, as the bees seize every opportunity for the perform- %0a%3c ance of their task when the days are fine ; in one or two %0a%3c days, at most, they fill their cells with honey. %0a%3c %0a%3c (12.) This substance is engendered from the air,^- mostly at %0a%3c the rising of the constellations, and more especially when %0a%3c Sirius is shining ; never, however, before the rising of the %0a%3c Vergiliae, and then just before day-break. Hence it is, that at %0a%3c early dawn the leaves of the trees are found covered with a %0a%3c kind of honey-like dew, and those who go into the open air at %0a%3c an early hour in the morning, find their clothes covered, and %0a%3c their hair matted, with a sort of unctuous liquid. "Whether %0a%3c it is that this liquid is the sweat of the heavens, or whether %0a%3c u saliva emanating from the stars, or a juice exuding from the %0a%3c air while purifying itself, would that it had been, when it %0a%3c com.e8 to us, pure, limpid, and genuine, as it was, when first %0a%3c it took its downward descent.

WHEKE THE BEST HONEY IS PRODUCED. %0a%3c %0a%3c The honey is always best in those countries where it is to %0a%3c be found deposited in the calix of the most exquisite flowers, %0a%3c such, for instance, as the districts of Hymettus and Hybla, %0a%3c in Attica and Sicily respectively, and after them the island of %0a%3c Calydna.^- At first, honey is thin, like water, after which it %0a%3c effervesces for some days, and purifies itself like must. On %0a%3c the twentieth day it begins to thicken, and soon after becomes %0a%3c covered with a thin membrane, which gradually increases %0a%3c through the scum which is thrown up by the heat. The %0a%3c honey of the very finest flavour, and the least tainted by the %0a%3c leaves of trees, is that gathered from the foKage of the oak %0a%3c and the linden, and from reeds. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 14. (14.) — THE KINDS OF HONEY PECtJXIAK TO VARIOUS %0a%3c PLACES. %0a%3c %0a%3c The peculiar excellence of honey depends, as already stated," %0a%3c on the country in which it is produced ; the modes, too, of %0a%3c estimating its quality are numerous. In some countries we find %0a%3c the honey-comb remarkable for the goodness of the wax, as iu %0a%3c Sicily, for instance, and the country of the Peligni ; in other %0a%3c places the honey itself is found in greater abundance, as in %0a%3c Crete, Cyprus, and Africa ; and in others, again, the comb is %0a%3c remarkable for its size ; the northern climates, for instance, %0a%3c for in Germany a comb has been known to be as much as eight %0a%3c feet in length, and quite black on the concave surface. %0a%3c %0a%3c Butwhatever the country in which it may happen to have been %0a%3c produced, there are three different kinds of honey. — Spring %0a%3c honey is that made in a comb which has been constructed of %0a%3c flowers, from which cii'cumstance it has received the name of %0a%3c thinum. There are some persons who say that this should not %0a%3c be touched, because the more abundant the nutriment, the %0a%3c %0a%3c 32 See B. iv. c. 24. 33 the last Chapter. %0a%3c %0a%3c 34 Qr " Flower-honey." %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 14.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c VAHIOTJS KIKDS OF HONEY. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 13 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c stronger Avill be the coming swarm ; while others, again, leave %0a%3c less of this honey than of any other for the bees, on the ground %0a%3c that there is sure to be a vast abundance at the rising of the %0a%3c greater constellations, as well as at the summer solstice, when %0a%3c the thyme and the vine begin to blossom, for then they are %0a%3c sure to find abundant materials for their cells. %0a%3c %0a%3c In taking the combs the greatest care is always requisite, for %0a%3c when they are stinted for food the bees become desperate, and %0a%3c either pine to death, or else wing their flight to other places : %0a%3c but on the other hand, over-abundance will entail idleness, %0a%3c and then they will feed upon the honey, and not the bee-bread. %0a%3c Hence it is that the most careful breeders take care to leave %0a%3c the bees a fifteenth part of this gathering. There is a certain %0a%3c day for beginning the honey-gathering, fixed, as it were, by a %0a%3c law of Nature, if men would only understand or observe it, %0a%3c being the thirtieth day after the bees have swarmed and come %0a%3c forth. This gathering mostly takes place before the end of %0a%3c May. %0a%3c %0a%3c The second kind of honey is "summer honey," which, from %0a%3c the circumstance of its being produced at the most favourable %0a%3c season, has received the Greek name of horaion it is gene- %0a%3c rally made during the next thirty days after the solstice, while %0a%3c Sirius is shining in all its brilliancy. Nature has revealed in %0a%3c this substance most remarkable properties to mortals, were it %0a%3c not that the fraudulent propensities of man are apt to falsify %0a%3c and corrupt everything. For, after the rising of each constel- %0a%3c lation, and those of the highest rank more particularly, or after %0a%3c the appearance of the rainbow, if a shower does not ensue, %0a%3c but the dew becomes warmed by the sun's rays, a medicament, %0a%3c and not real honey, is produced ; a gift sent from heaven for %0a%3c the cure of diseases of the eyes, ulcers, and maladies of the %0a%3c internal viscera. If this is taken at the rising of Sirius, and %0a%3c the rising of Yenus, Jupiter, or Mercury should happen to fall %0a%3c on the same day, as ' often is the case, the sweetness of this %0a%3c substance, and the virtue which it possesses of restoring men %0a%3c to life, are not inferior to those attributed to the nectar of the %0a%3c gods. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 3* Season-honey. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 14 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c PLI^^l's NATUEAL HISTOSr. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XI. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 15.

In all %0a%3c honey, that which flows of itself, like must or oil, has received %0a%3c from'us the name of acetum."^ The summer honey is the most %0a%3c esteemed of all, from the fact of its being made when the %0a%3c weather is driest : it is looked upon as the most serviceable %0a%3c when made from thyme it is then of a golden colour, and %0a%3c of a most delicious flavour. The honey that we sec formed %0a%3c in the calix of flowers is of a rich and unctuous nature ; that %0a%3c which is made from rosemary is thick, while that Avhich is %0a%3c candied is little esteemed. Thyme honey does not coagulate, %0a%3c and on being touched will draw out into thin viscous threads, %0a%3c a thing which is the principal proof of its heaviness. When %0a%3c honey shows no tenacity, and the drops immediately part %0a%3c fr"om one another, it is looked upon as a sign of its worthless- %0a%3c ness. The other proofs of its goodness are the fine aroma of %0a%3c its smell, its being of a sweetness that closely borders on the %0a%3c sour,^^ and being glutinous and pellucid. %0a%3c %0a%3c Cassius Dionysius is of opinion that in the summer gathering %0a%3c the tenth part of the honey ought to be left for the bees if the %0a%3c hives should happen to be well filled, and even if not, still iu %0a%3c the same proportion ; while, on the other hand, if there is but %0a%3c little in them, he recommends that it should not be touched %0a%3c at aU.

The Athenians call this plant by the name of tetralix,^^ %0a%3c and the Euboeans sisimvi, and they look upon it as aifording %0a%3c great pleasure to the bees to browse upon, probably because %0a%3c there are no other flowers for them to resort to. This gather- %0a%3c ing terminates at the end of the vintage and the setting of %0a%3c the Yergilia), mostly about the ides of November.'*-' Expe- %0a%3c rience teaches us that we ought to leave for the bees two- %0a%3c thirds of this crop, and always that part of the combs as well, %0a%3c which contains the bee-bread. %0a%3c %0a%3c From the winter solstice to the rising of Arcturus the bees %0a%3c are buried in sleep for sixty days, and live without any nourish- %0a%3c ment. Between the rising of Arcturus and the vernal equinox, %0a%3c they awake in the warmer climates, but even then they still %0a%3c keep within the hives, and have recourse to the provisions %0a%3c kept in reserve for this period. In Italy, however, they do %0a%3c this immediately after the rising of the Vergilije, up to which %0a%3c period they are asleep. Some persons, when they take the %0a%3c honey, weigh the hive and all, and remove just as much as %0a%3c they leave : a due sense of equity should always be stringently %0a%3c observed in dealing with them, and it is generally stated that %0a%3c if imposed upon in this division, the swarm will die of grief. %0a%3c It is particularly recommended also that the person who takes %0a%3c the honey should be well washed and clean : bees have a par- %0a%3c ticular aversion, too, to a thief and a menstnious woman.

THE KKPRODtJCTIOX OF BEES. %0a%3c %0a%3c How bees generate their young has been a subject of great %0a%3c and subtle research among the learned ; seeing that no one has %0a%3c ever witnessed" any sexual intercourse among these insects. %0a%3c Many persons have expressed an opinion that they must be %0a%3c produced from flowers, aptly and artistically arranged by %0a%3c Nature ; while others, again, suppose that they are produced %0a%3c from an intercourse with the one which is to be found in every %0a%3c Gwarm, and is usually called the king. This one, they say, is %0a%3c the only male** in the hive, and is endowed with such ex- %0a%3c traordinarj' proportions, that it may not become exhausted %0a%3c in the performance of its duties. Hence it is, that no off- %0a%3c spring can be produced without it, all the other bees being %0a%3c females,*' and attending it in its capacity of a male, and not %0a%3c as their leader. This opinion, however, which is otherwise %0a%3c not improbable, is sufficiently refuted by the generation of the %0a%3c drones. For on what grounds could it possibly happen that %0a%3c the same intercourse should produce an offspring part of which %0a%3c is perfect, and part in an imperfect state ? The first surmise %0a%3c which I have mentioned would appear, indeed, to be much %0a%3c nearer the truth, were it not the case that here another diffi- %0a%3c culty meets us — the circumstance that sometimes, at the ex- %0a%3c tremity of the combs, there are produced bees of a larger size, %0a%3c which put the others to flight. This noxious bee bears the %0a%3c name of oestrus, and how is it possible that it should ever be %0a%3c produced, if it is the fact that the bees themselves form their %0a%3c progeny %0a%3c %0a%3c A fact, however, that is well ascertained, is, that bees sit,"' %0a%3c like the domestic fowl, that which is hatched by them at %0a%3c %0a%3c ^ " TJnsmoked " honoy. %0a%3c %0a%3c It takes place while they are on the wing. %0a%3c The only prolific /cma^, in reality. %0a%3c ^5 Some nnprolific females and some males, in reality. %0a%3c 50 Cuvier thinks that either hornets, or else the drones, must be alluded %0a%3c to.

If a per- %0a%3c son takes off the head of either kind before the wings are %0a%3c formed, the rest of the body is considered a most choice morsel %0a%3c by the parents. In process of time the parent bees instil %0a%3c nutriment into them, and sit upon them, making on this occa- %0a%3c sion a loud humming noise, for the purpose, it is generally %0a%3c supposed, of generating that warmth which is so requisite for %0a%3c hatching the young. At length the membrane in which each %0a%3c of them is enveloped, as though it lay in an egg, bursts asunder, %0a%3c and the whole swarm comes to light. %0a%3c %0a%3c This circumstance was witnessed at the suburban retreat of %0a%3c a man of consular dignity near Rome, whose hives were made %0a%3c of transparent lantern horn : the young were found to be deve- %0a%3c loped in the space of forty-five days. In some combs, there is %0a%3c found Avhat is known by the name of " nail" wax it is bitter %0a%3c and hard, and is only met with when the bees have failed to %0a%3c hatch their young, either from disease or a natural sterility, %0a%3c it is the abortion, in fact, of the bees. The young ones, the %0a%3c moment they are hatched, commence working with their %0a%3c parents, as though in a course of training, and tlie newly-born %0a%3c king is accompanied by a multitude of his own age. %0a%3c %0a%3c That the supply may not run short, each swarm rears seve- %0a%3c ral kings ; but afterwards, Avhen this progeny begins to arrive %0a%3c at a mature age, with one accord^ they put to death the in- %0a%3c ferior ones, lest they should create discord in the swarm. %0a%3c There are two sorts of king bees ; those of a reddish colour are %0a%3c better than the black and mottled ones. The kings have %0a%3c %0a%3c *3 This is not the fact.

(17.) THE MODE OF GOVERNMENT OF THE BEES. %0a%3c %0a%3c Let a man employ himself, forsooth, in the enquiry whether %0a%3c there has been only one Hercules, how many fathers Liber %0a%3c there have been, and all the other questions which are buried %0a%3c deep in the mould of antiquity .' Here behold a tiny object, %0a%3c one to be met with at most of our country retreats, and num- %0a%3c bers of which are always at hand, and yet, after all, it is not %0a%3c agreed among authors whether or not the king'^ is the only one %0a%3c among them that is provided with no sting, and is possessed %0a%3c of no other arms than those afforded him by his majestic office, %0a%3c or whether, Nature has granted him a sting, and has only denied %0a%3c him the power of making use of it ; it being a well-knowu %0a%3c fact, that the ruling bee never does use a sting. The obedi- %0a%3c ence which his subjects manifest in his presence is quite sur- %0a%3c prising. When he goes forth, the whole swarm attends him, %0a%3c throngs about him, surrounds him, protects him, and will not %0a%3c allow him to be seen. At other times, when the swarm is at %0a%3c work within, the king is seen to visit the works, and appears %0a%3c to be giving his encouragement, being himself the only one %0a%3c that is exempt from work : around him are certain other bees %0a%3c which act as' body-guards and lictors, the careful guardians of %0a%3c his authority. The king never quits tlie hive except when the %0a%3c swarm is about to depart ; a thing which may be known a long %0a%3c time beforehand, as for some days a peculiar buzzing noise %0a%3c is to be heard within, which denotes that the bees are waiting %0a%3c for a favourable day, and making all due preparations for their %0a%3c departure. On such an occasion, if care is taken to deprive the %0a%3c king of one of his wings, the swarm will not fiy away. When %0a%3c they are on the wing, everyone is anxious to be near him, and %0a%3c takes a pleasure in being seen in the performance of its duty. %0a%3c When he is weary, they support him on their shoulders ; and %0a%3c %0a%3c 58 The greater size of the abdomen makes the wings look shorter. %0a%3c %0a%3c 59 The queen has a sting, like the working bees, but uses it less fre- %0a%3c quently. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 18 ] OMENS AFFOEDED BY A SWARM OF BEES. 19 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c when he is quite tired, they carry him outright.

Bees settled upon the lips of %0a%3c Plato when still an infant even, announcing thereby the sweet- %0a%3c ness of that persuasive eloquence for which he was so noted. %0a%3c Bees settled, too, in the camp of the chieftain Drusus when, %0a%3c he gained the brilliant victory at Arbalo f° a proof, indeed, %0a%3c that the conjectures of soothsayers are not hy any means in- %0a%3c fallible, seeing that they are of opinion that this is always of %0a%3c evil augmy. AVhen their leader is withheld from them, the %0a%3c swarm can always be detained ; and when lost, it will disperse %0a%3c and take its departure to find other kings. Without a king, %0a%3c in fact, thej^ cannot exist, and it is with the greatest reluct- %0a%3c ance that they put them to death when there are several ; they %0a%3c 2)refer, too, to destroy the cells of the j'oung ones, if they find %0a%3c reason to despair of providing food ; in such case they then %0a%3c expel the drones. And yet, with regard to the last, I find that %0a%3c some doubts are entertained ; and that there are some authors %0a%3c who are of opinion that they form a peculiar species, like that %0a%3c bee, the very largest among them all, which is known by the %0a%3c name of the " thief,'"*^ because it furtively devours the honey ; %0a%3c it is distinguished by its black colour and the largeness of its %0a%3c body. It is a well-known fact, however, that the bees are in %0a%3c the habit of killing the drones. These last have no king of %0a%3c their own ; but how it is that they are produced without a %0a%3c sting, is a matter still undetermined. %0a%3c %0a%3c In a wet spring the young swarms are more numerous ; in %0a%3c a dry one the honey is most abundant.

The swarm that is thus attacked, at once %0a%3c ranges itself in battle array, and if the bee-keeper should %0a%3c happen to be present, that side which perceives itself favoured %0a%3c by him will reti-ain from attacking him. They often fight, %0a%3c too, for other reasons as well, and the two generals are to be %0a%3c seen drawing up their ranks in battle array against their op- %0a%3c ponents. The dispute generally arises in culling from the %0a%3c flowers, when each, the moment that it is in danger, summons %0a%3c its companions to its aid. The battle, however, is immediately %0a%3c put an end to by throwing dust*^- among them, or raising a %0a%3c smoke ; and if milk or honey mixed with water is placed be- %0a%3c fore them, they speedily become reconciled. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 19. (18.) THE VARIOUS KINDS OF BEES. %0a%3c %0a%3c There are field bees also, and wild bees, ungainly in appear- %0a%3c ance, and much more irascible than the others, but remarkable %0a%3c for their laboriousness and the excellence of their work. Of %0a%3c domestic bees there are two sorts ; the best are those with %0a%3c short bodies, speckled all over, and of a compact round shape. %0a%3c Those that are long, and resemble the wasp in appearance, %0a%3c are an inferior kind ; and of these last, the very worst of all %0a%3c are those which have the body covered with hair. In Pontus %0a%3c there is a kind of white bee, which makes honey twice a %0a%3c month. On the banks of the river Thermodon there are %0a%3c two kinds found, one of which makes honey in the trees, the %0a%3c other under ground : they form a triple row of combs, and %0a%3c produce honey in the greatest abundance. %0a%3c %0a%3c Nature has provided bees with a sting, which is inserted in %0a%3c the abdomen of the insect. There are some who think that %0a%3c at the first blow which they inflict with this weapon they will %0a%3c instantly die,^' while others, again, are of opinion that such is %0a%3c not the case, unless the animal drives it so deep as to cause %0a%3c a portion of the intestines to follow ; and they assert, also, %0a%3c that after they have thus lost their sting they become drones," %0a%3c %0a%3c 8- So Virgil says — %0a%3c %0a%3c ■ " Haec certamina tanta %0a%3c %0a%3c Pulveris exigui jactu compressa quiescent." — Georg. iv. 87. %0a%3c If it is left in the wound, the insect dies, being torn asunder %0a%3c «i Of course this is fabulous, as the drones are males. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 20.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c THE DISEASES OF BEES. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 21 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c and make no honey, being thus castrated, so to say, and %0a%3c equally incapable of inflicting injury, and of making themselves %0a%3c useful by their labours. We have instances stated of horses %0a%3c being killed by bees. %0a%3c %0a%3c They have a great aversion to bad smells, and fly away %0a%3c from them ; a dislike which extends to artificial perfumes %0a%3c even. Hence it is that they will attack persons who smell %0a%3c of unguents. They themselves, also, are exposed to the %0a%3c attacks of wasps and hornets, which belong to the same class, %0a%3c but are of a degenerate^ nature ; these wage continual warfare %0a%3c against them, as also does a species of gnat, which is known %0a%3c by the name of " mulio;""® swallows, too, and various other %0a%3c birds prey upon them. Frogs lie in wait for them when in %0a%3c quest of water, which, in fact, is their principal occupation %0a%3c at the time they are rearing their young. And it is not only %0a%3c the frog that frequents ponds and streams that is thus injuri- %0a%3c ous to them, but the bramble-frog as well, which will come %0a%3c to the hives even in search of them, and, crawling up to the %0a%3c entrance, breathe through the apertures ; upon hearing which, a %0a%3c bee flies to the spot, and is snapped up in an instant. It is %0a%3c generally stated that frogs are proof against the sting of the %0a%3c bee. Sheep, too, are peculiarly dangerous to them, as they %0a%3c have the greatest difficulty in extricating themselves from %0a%3c the fleece. The smell of crabs,®' if they happen to be cooked in %0a%3c their vicinity, is fatal to them. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 20. — THE DISEASES OF BEES. %0a%3c %0a%3c Bees are also by nature liable to certain diseases of their %0a%3c own. The sign that they are diseased, is a kind of torpid, %0a%3c moping sadness : on such occasions, they are to be seen bring- %0a%3c ing out those that are sick before the hives, and placing them %0a%3c in the warm sun, while others, again, are providing them with %0a%3c food. Those that are dead they carry away from the hive, %0a%3c and attend the bodies, pajdng their last duties, as it were, in %0a%3c funeral procession. If the king should happen to be carried %0a%3c off by the pestilence, the swarm remains plunged in grief and %0a%3c listless inactivity ; it collects no more food, and ceases to issue %0a%3c %0a%3c ^ Though belonging to the same class, they are not of degenerate kinds. %0a%3c 60 The "mule-gnat." %0a%3c %0a%3c See Virgil, Georg.

Indeed, %0a%3c if due care is not taken to come to their aid, they will die of %0a%3c hunger. It is from their cheerfulness, in fact, and their %0a%3c bright and sleek appearance that we usually form an estimate %0a%3c as to their health. %0a%3c %0a%3c (19) There are certain maladies, also, which affect their %0a%3c productions ; when they do not fill their combs, the disease %0a%3c under which they are labouring is known by the name of %0a%3c claros,^^ and if they fail to rear their young, they are suffering %0a%3c from the effects of that kno-^oi as llapsigonia.^^ %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 21. THII^GS THAT ARE NOXIOUS TO BEES. %0a%3c %0a%3c Echo, or the noise made by the reverberation of the air, %0a%3c is also injurious to bees, as it dismays them by its redoubled %0a%3c sounds ; fogs, also, are noxious to them. Spiders, too, are espe- %0a%3c cially hostile to bees ; when they have gone so far as to build their %0a%3c webs within the hive, the death of the whole swarm is the result. %0a%3c The common and ignoble moth,™ too, that is to be seen fluttering %0a%3c about a burning candle, is deadly to them, and that in more %0a%3c ways than one. It devours the wax, and leaves its ordure %0a%3c behind it, from which the maggot known to us as the " teredo " %0a%3c is produced ; besides which, wherever it goes, it drops the %0a%3c down from off its wings, and thereby thickens the threads of %0a%3c the cobwebs. The teredo is also engendered in the wood of %0a%3c the hive, and then it proves especially destructive to the wax. %0a%3c Bees are the victims, also, of their own greediness, for when %0a%3c they glut themselves overmuch with the juices of the flowers, in %0a%3c the spring season more particularly, they are troubled with %0a%3c flux and looseness. Olive oil is fatal'* to not only bees, but %0a%3c all other insects as well, and more especially if they are placed %0a%3c %0a%3c The reading seems doubtful, and the meaning is probably unknown. %0a%3c " Injury of the young." %0a%3c %0a%3c Tliere are two kinds of hive-moth — the Phalsena tinea mcllanella of %0a%3c Linnaeus, and the Phalrena tortrix cereana.

WASPS AND HORNETS : ANIMALS WHICK APPEO- %0a%3c %0a%3c PKIATE WHAT BELONGS TO OTHERS. %0a%3c %0a%3c "Wasps build their nests of mud in lofty places," and make %0a%3c wax therein : hornets, on the other hand, build in holes or %0a%3c under ground. With these two kinds the cells are also hex- %0a%3c agonal, but, in other respects, though made of the bark of trees, %0a%3c tbey strongly resemble the substance of a spider's web. Their %0a%3c young also are found at irregular intervals, and are of un- %0a%3c shapely appearance ; while one is able to fly, another is still a %0a%3c mere pupa, and a third only in the maggot state. It is in %0a%3c the autumn, too, and not in the spring, that all their young are %0a%3c produced; and they grow during the full moon more pai'- %0a%3c ticularly. The wasp which is known as the ichneumon," a %0a%3c smaller kind than the others, kills one kind of spider in parti- %0a%3c cular, known as the phalangium ; after which it carries the %0a%3c body to its nest, covers it over with a sort of gluey substance, %0a%3c and then sits and hatches from it its young.''* In addi- %0a%3c tion to this, they are all of them carnivorous, while on the %0a%3c other hand bees will touch no animal substance whatever. %0a%3c Wasps more particularly pursue the larger flies, and after %0a%3c catching them cut off the head and carry away the remaining %0a%3c portion of the body. %0a%3c %0a%3c Wild hornets live in the holes of trees, and in winter, like %0a%3c other insects, keep themselves concealed ; their life does not %0a%3c exceed two years in length.

In spring they build %0a%3c their nests, which have generally four entrances, and here it is %0a%3c that the working hornets are produced : after these have been %0a%3c hatched they form other nests of larger size, in which to bring %0a%3c forth the parents of the future generation. From this time %0a%3c the working hornets begin to follow their vocation, and apply %0a%3c themselves to supplying the others with food. The parent %0a%3c hornets are of larger size than the others, and it is very doubt- %0a%3c ful whether they have a sting, as it is never to be seen %0a%3c protruded. These races, too, have their drones. Some persons %0a%3c are of opinion that all these insects lose their stings in the %0a%3c winter.

They construct their %0a%3c nests of a kind of mud which has the appearance of salt, and %0a%3c then fasten them to a stone, where they become so hard, that %0a%3c it is scarcely possible to penetrate them with a dart even. %0a%3c In these nests they make wax, in larger quantities than bees, %0a%3c and the grub which they then produce is larger. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 26. — THE LAEV^ OF THE SILK-WOEM — WHO FIEST INVENTED %0a%3c SILK CLOTHS. %0a%3c %0a%3c There is another class also of these insects produced in quite %0a%3c a diflferent manner. These last spring from a grub of larger %0a%3c size, with two horns of very peculiar appearance. The %0a%3c larva then becomes a caterpillar, after which it assumes the %0a%3c state in which it is known as homhylis, then that called necy- %0a%3c dalm, and after that, in six months, it becomes a silk-worm." %0a%3c %0a%3c Cuvier says that it is the males, and not the females, that have no sting. %0a%3c %0a%3c What modern naturalists call the " Hymenoptera." %0a%3c *' Some kind of wasp, or, as Cuvier says, probably the mason bee. %0a%3c ^ Called "bombyx" also; though, as Cuvier remarks, of a kind al- %0a%3c together different from the preceding one. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 26 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Flint's natural history. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XI. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c These insects weave webs similar to those of the spider, the %0a%3c material of which is used for making the more costly and %0a%3c luxurious garments of females, known as " bombycina. Pam- %0a%3c phile, a woman of Cos,**' the daughter of Platea, was the first %0a%3c person who discovered the art of unravelling these webs and %0a%3c spinning a tissue therefrom ; indeed, she ought not to be de- %0a%3c prived of the glorj' of having discovered the art of making %0a%3c vestments which, while they cover a woman, at the same mo- %0a%3c ment reveal her naked charms. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 27. (23.) THE SILK-WORM OF COS HOW THE COAN %0a%3c %0a%3c VESTMENTS ARE MADE. %0a%3c %0a%3c The silk-worm, too, is said to be a native of the isle of Cos, %0a%3c where the vapours of the earth give new life to the flowers %0a%3c of the cypress, the terebinth, the ash, and the oak which have %0a%3c been beaten down by the showers. At first they assume the %0a%3c appearance of small butterflies with naked bodies, but soon %0a%3c after, being unable to endure the cold, they throw out bristly %0a%3c hairs, and assume quite a thick coat against the winter, by %0a%3c rubbing off the down that covers the leaves, by the aid of %0a%3c the roughness of their feet. This they compress into balls %0a%3c by carding it with their claws, and then draw it out and %0a%3c hang it between the branches of the trees, making it fine %0a%3c by combing it out as it were : last of all, they take and roll it %0a%3c round their body, thus forming a nest in which they are enve- %0a%3c loped. It is in this state that they are taken ; after which %0a%3c they are placed in earthen vessels in a warm place, and fed %0a%3c upon bran. A peculiar sort of down soon shoots forth upon %0a%3c the body, on being clothed with which they are sent to work %0a%3c upon another task. The cocoons®^ which they have begun to %0a%3c t'orm are rendered soft and pliable by the aid of water, and %0a%3c are then drawn out into threads by means of a spindle made of %0a%3c a reed.

(24.) — spiDEES; the kinds that make webs; the %0a%3c %0a%3c MATERIALS USED BY THEM IN SO DOING. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is by no means an absurdity to append to the silk-worm %0a%3c an account of the spider, a creature which is worthy of our %0a%3c especial admiration. There arc numerous kinds of spiders, how- %0a%3c ever, which it will not be necessary here to mention, from the %0a%3c fact of their being so well known. Those that bear the name %0a%3c oi phalangium are of small size, with bodies spotted and run- %0a%3c ning to a point ; their bite is venomous, and they leap as they %0a%3c move from place to place. Another kind, again, is black, and %0a%3c the fore-legs are remarkable for their length. Thej^ have all of %0a%3c them three joints in the legs. The smaller kind of wolf-spider*' %0a%3c does not make a web, but the larger ones make their holes in %0a%3c the earth, and spread their nets at the narrow entrance thereof. %0a%3c A third kind, again, is remarkable for the skill which it dis- %0a%3c plays in its operations. These spin a large web, and the ab- %0a%3c domen suffices to supply the material for so extensive a work, %0a%3c whether it is that, at stated periods the excrements are largely %0a%3c secreted in the abdomen, as Democritus thinks, or that the %0a%3c creature has in itself a certain faculty of secreting®* a peculiar %0a%3c sort of woolly substance. How steadily does it work with its %0a%3c claws, how beautifully rounded and how equal are the threads %0a%3c as it forms its web, while it employs the weight of its body as %0a%3c an equipoise ! It begins at the middle to weave its web, and %0a%3c then extends it by adding the threads in rings around, like a %0a%3c warp upon the woof : forming the meshes at equal intervals, %0a%3c but continually enlarging them as the web increases in breadth, %0a%3c it finally unites them all by an indissoluble knot. "With what %0a%3c wondrous art does it conceal the snares that lie in wait %0a%3c for its prey in its checkered nettings !

How loose, too, is the body of the web %0a%3c as it yields to the blasts, and how readily does it catch all objects %0a%3c which come in its way ! You Avould fancy that it had left, %0a%3c quite exhausted, the thrums of the upper portion of its net %0a%3c unfinished where they are spread across ; it is with the great- %0a%3c est difficulty that they are to be perceived, and yet the moment %0a%3c that an object touches them, like the lines of the hunter's net, %0a%3c they throw it into the body of the web. With what archi- %0a%3c tectural skill, too, is its hole arched over, and how well de- %0a%3c fended by a nap of extra thickness against the cold ! How %0a%3c carefully, too, it retires into a corner, and appears intent upon %0a%3c anything but what it really is, all the while that it is so care- %0a%3c fully shut up from view, that it is impossible to perceive whe- %0a%3c ther there is anything within or not I And then too, how ex- %0a%3c traordinary the strength of the web ! When is the wind ever %0a%3c known to break it, or what accumulation of dust is able to %0a%3c weigh it down ? %0a%3c %0a%3c The spider often spreads its web right across between two %0a%3c trees, when plpng its art and learning how to spin ; and then, %0a%3c as to its length, the thread extends from the very top of the %0a%3c tree to the ground, while the insect springs up again in an %0a%3c instant from the earth, and travels aloft by the very self-same %0a%3c thread, thus mounting at the same moment and spinning %0a%3c its threads. When its prey falls into its net, how on the alert %0a%3c it is, and with what readiness it runs to seize it ! Even %0a%3c though it should be adhering to the very edge of its web, the %0a%3c insect always runs instantly to the middle, as it is by these %0a%3c means that it can most effectually shake the web, and so suc- %0a%3c cessfully entangle its prey. When the web is torn, the %0a%3c spider immediately sets about repairing it, and that so neatly, %0a%3c that nothing like patching can ever be seen. The spider lies %0a%3c in wait even for the young of the lizard, and after enveloping %0a%3c the head of the animal, bites its lips ; a sight by no means %0a%3c unworthy of the amphitheatre itself, when it is one's good for- %0a%3c tune to witness it. Presages also are drawn from the spider ; %0a%3c for when a river is about to swell, it will suspend its web %0a%3c higher than usual. In calm weather these insects do not spin, %0a%3c but when it is cloudy they do, and hence it is, that a great %0a%3c number of cobwebs is a sure sign of showery weather.

THE GENEEATION OF SPIDEES. %0a%3c %0a%3c Spiders couple®^ backwards, and produce maggots like eggs ; %0a%3c for I ought not to defer making some mention of this subject, %0a%3c seeing, in fact, that of most insects there is hardly anything %0a%3c else to be said. All these eggs they lay in their webs, but %0a%3c scattered about, as they leap from place to place while laying %0a%3c them. The phalangium is the only spider that lays a con- %0a%3c siderable number of them, in a hole ; and as soon as ever %0a%3c the progeny is hatched it devours its mother, and very often %0a%3c the male parent as well, for that, too, aids in the process of %0a%3c incubation. These last produce as many as three hundred %0a%3c eggs, the others a smaller number. Spiders take three days %0a%3c to hatch their eggs. They come to their full growth in %0a%3c twenty-eight days. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 30. (25.) — SCOEPIONS. %0a%3c %0a%3c In a similar manner to the spider, the land scorpion also pro- %0a%3c duces maggots^ similar to eggs, and dies in a similar manner. %0a%3c This animal is a dangerous scourge, and has a venom like that %0a%3c of the serpent ; with the exception that its effects are far %0a%3c more"^ painful, as the person who is stung will linger for %0a%3c three days before death ensues. The sting is invariably %0a%3c fatal to virgins, and nearly always so to matrons. It is so %0a%3c to men also, in the morning, when the animal has issued from %0a%3c its hole in a fasting state, and has not yet happened to dis- %0a%3c charge its poison by any accidental stroke. The tail is always %0a%3c ready to strike, and ceases not for an instant to menace, so %0a%3c that no opportunity may possibly be missed. The animal %0a%3c strikes too with a sidelong blow, or else by turning the tail %0a%3c %0a%3c They copulate in a manner dissimilar to that of any other insects — %0a%3c the male fecundates the female by the aid of feelers, which he introduces %0a%3c into the vulva of the female situate beneath the anterior part of the %0a%3c abdomen. %0a%3c %0a%3c Cuvier remarks, that the scorpion is viviparous ; but the young are %0a%3c ■white when born, and wrapped up in an oval mass, for which reason they %0a%3c may easily be taken for maggots or grubs. %0a%3c %0a%3c 9' This must be understood of the scorpion of Egypt, Libya, and Syria. %0a%3c The sting of that of the south of Europe is not generally dangerous. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 30 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c PLINT'8 NATtJKAL ITISTOET. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XI. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c upwards. Apollodorus informs us, that the poison which %0a%3c they secrete is of a white colour, and he has divided them into %0a%3c nine classes, distinguished mostly hy their colours — to very %0a%3c little purpose, however, for it is impossible to understand %0a%3c which among these it is that he has pronounced to be the %0a%3c least dangerous. He says, also, that some of them have a %0a%3c double sting, and that the males — for he asserts that they are %0a%3c engendered by the union of the sexes — are the most dangerous. %0a%3c These may easily be known, he says, by their slender form %0a%3c and greater length. He states, also, that they all of them have %0a%3c venom in the middle of the day, when they have been warmed %0a%3c by the heat of the sun, as, also, when they are thirsty — their %0a%3c thirst, indeed, can never be quenched. It is an ascertained %0a%3c fact, that those which have seven joints in the tail are the %0a%3c most"^ deadly ; the greater part, however, have but six. %0a%3c %0a%3c For this pest of Africa, the southern winds have provided %0a%3c means of flight as well, for as the breeze bears them along, %0a%3c they extend their arms and ply them like so many oars iu %0a%3c their flight ; the same Apollodorus, however, asserts that there %0a%3c are some which really have wings. The Ps5'lli, who for their %0a%3c own profit have been in the habit of importing the poisons of %0a%3c other lands among us, and have thus filled Italy with the pests %0a%3c Avhich belong to other regions, have made attempts to import %0a%3c the flying scorpion as well, but it. has been found that it %0a%3c cannot live further north than the latitude of Sicily. How- %0a%3c ever, they^'' are sometimes to be seen in Italy, but are quite %0a%3c harmless there ; they are found, also, in many other places, tlie %0a%3c vicinity of Pharos, in Egypt, for instance. In Scythia, the %0a%3c scorpion is able to kill the swine even with its sting, an animal %0a%3c which, in general, is proof against poisons of this kind in a %0a%3c remarkable degree. 'When stung, those swine which are black %0a%3c die more speedily than others, and more particularly if they %0a%3c happen to throw themselves into the water. When a person %0a%3c has been stung, it is generally supposed that he may be cured %0a%3c by drinking the ashes of the scorpion"^ mixed with wine. It %0a%3c %0a%3c 92 Cuvier seems to regard this as fanciful : he says that the instances of %0a%3c seven joints are but rarely to be met mtb. %0a%3c %0a%3c 93 There are no winged scorpions. Cuvier thinks that he may possibly %0a%3c allude to the panorpis, or scorpion-fly, the abdomen of which terminates %0a%3c in a forceps, which resembles the tail of the scorpion. %0a%3c %0a%3c 9* Probably the panorpis. %0a%3c 95 See B. xxk. c. 29. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c C'linp. 32.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c THE GRASSnorPER. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 31 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c is the belief also that there is nothing more baneful to the %0a%3c scorpion and the stellio,*' than to dip them in oil. This last %0a%3c animal is also dangerous to all other creatures, except those %0a%3c which, like itself, are destitute of blood : in figure it strongi}- %0a%3c resemblcs the common lizard. For the most part, also, %0a%3c the scorpion does no injiiry to any animal which is bloodless. %0a%3c Some writers, too, are of opinion that the scorpion devours its %0a%3c offspring, and that the one among the young which is the most %0a%3c adroit avails itself of its sole mode of escape, by placing itself %0a%3c on the back of the mother, and thus finding a place where it %0a%3c is in safety from the tail and the sting. The one that thus %0a%3c escapes, they say, becomes the avenger of the rest, and at last, %0a%3c taking advantage of its elevated position, puts its parents to %0a%3c death.

In %0a%3c India, it is said that they attain the length of three feet, and %0a%3c that the people dry the legs and thighs, and use them for saws. %0a%3c There is another mode, also, in which these creatures perish ; %0a%3c the winds carry them off in vast swarms, upon which they fall %0a%3c into the sea or standing waters, and not, as the ancients sup- %0a%3c posed, because their wings have been drenched by the damp- %0a%3c ness of the night. The same authors have also stated, that %0a%3c they are unable to fly during the night, in consequence of the %0a%3c cold, being ignorant of the fact, that they travel over lengthened %0a%3c tracts of sea for many days together, a thing the more to be won- %0a%3c dered they have to endure hunger all the time as well, for %0a%3c this it is which causes them to be thus seeking pastures in other %0a%3c lands. This is looked upon as a plague^^ inflicted by the anger %0a%3c of the gods ; for as they fly they appear to be larger than they %0a%3c really are, while they make such a loud noise with their wings, %0a%3c that they might be readily supposed to be winged creatures of %0a%3c quite anoth^ species. Their numbers, too, are so vast, that they %0a%3c quite darken the sun ; while the people below are anxiously %0a%3c following them with the eye, to see if they are about to make %0a%3c a descent, and so cover their lands. After all, they have %0a%3c the requisite energies for their flight ; and, as though it had %0a%3c been but a trifling matter to pass over the seas, they cross im- %0a%3c mense tracts of country, and cover them in clouds which bode %0a%3c destruction to the harvests. Scorching numerous objects by %0a%3c their very contact, they eat away everything with their teeth, %0a%3c the very doors of the houses even. %0a%3c %0a%3c 25 nth May. %0a%3c %0a%3c Cuvier treats this story as purely imaginary. %0a%3c 30 Cuvier says that some have been known nearly a foot long, but not %0a%3c more. %0a%3c %0a%3c 3' He alludes to the ravages committed bv the swarms of the migratory %0a%3c locust, Grillus migratorius of Linnaeus. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 36.] ANTS. 37 %0a%3c %0a%3c Those from Africa are the ones which chiefly devastate %0a%3c Italy ; and more than once the Roman people have been obliged %0a%3c to have recourse to the Sibylline Books, to learn what remedies %0a%3c to employ under their existing apprehensions of impending %0a%3c fomine. In the territory of Cyrenaica^'^ there is a law, which %0a%3c even compels the people to make war, three times a year, %0a%3c against the locusts, first, by crushing their eggs, next by kill- %0a%3c ing the young, and last of all by killing those of full growth ; %0a%3c and he who fails to do so, incurs the penalty of being treated %0a%3c as a deserter. In the island of Lemnos also, there is a certain %0a%3c measure fixed by law, which each individual is bound to fill %0a%3c with locusts which he has killed, and then bring it to the %0a%3c magistrates. It is for this reason, too, that they pay such respect %0a%3c to the jack-daw, which flies to meet the locusts, and kills them %0a%3c in great numbers. In Syria, also, the people are placed under %0a%3c martial law, and compelled to kill them : in so many countries %0a%3c docs this dreadful pest prevail. The Parthians look upon %0a%3c them as a choice food,^* and the grasshopper as weU. The voice %0a%3c of tlie locust appears to proceed from the back part of the head. %0a%3c It is generally believed that in this place, where the shoidders %0a%3c join on to the body, they have, as it were, a kind of teeth, and %0a%3c that it is by grinding these against each other that they pro- %0a%3c duce the harsh noise which they make. It is more especially %0a%3c about the two equinoxes that they are to be heard, in the %0a%3c same way that we hear the chirrup of the grasshopper about %0a%3c the summer solstice. The coupling of locusts is similar to %0a%3c that of all other insects that couple, the female supporting %0a%3c the male, and turning back the extremity of the tail towards %0a%3c him ; it is only after a considerable time that they separate. %0a%3c In ail these kinds of insects the male is of smaller size than %0a%3c the female. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 36.

These insects, also, have a political community among %0a%3c themselves, and are possessed of both memory and foresight. %0a%3c They gnaw each grain before they lay it by, for fear lest it I %0a%3c should shoot while under ground ; those grains, again, which %0a%3c are too large for admission, they divide at the entrance of their %0a%3c holes ; and those which have become soaked by the rain, they %0a%3c bring out and dry.^® They work, too, by night, during the %0a%3c full moon ; but when there is no moon, they cease working. %0a%3c And then, too, in their labours, what ardour they display, %0a%3c what wondrous carefulness !

It is not improbable, Cuvier says, that some quadru- %0a%3c ped, in making holes in the ground, may have occasionally thrown up some %0a%3c grains of the precious metal. The story is derived from the narratives %0a%3c of Clearchus and Megasthenes. Another interpretation of this story has %0a%3c also been suggested. We find from some remarks of Mr. Wilson, in the %0a%3c Transactions of the Asiatic Society, on the Maliabharata, a Sanscrit poem, %0a%3c that various tribes on the mountains Meru and Mandara (supposed to lie %0a%3c between Hindostan and Tibet) used to sell grains of gold, which they %0a%3c CiAXei paippilaka, or "ant-gold," which, they said, was thrown up by ants, %0a%3c in Sanscrit called pippilaka.

It was through %0a%3c such vermin as this that the Dictator Sylla,** and Alcman, %0a%3c one of the most famous of the Grecian poets, met their deaths. %0a%3c These insects infest birds too, and are apt to kill the pheasant, %0a%3c unless it takes care to bathe itself in the dust. Of the animals %0a%3c that are covered with hair, it is supposed that the ass and the %0a%3c sheep are the only ones that are exempt from these vermin. %0a%3c They are produced, also, in certain kinds of cloth, and more %0a%3c particularly those made of the wool of sheep which have been %0a%3c killed by the wolf. I find it stated, also, by authors, that %0a%3c some kinds of water*' which we use for bathing are more pro- %0a%3c ductive of these parasites than others. Even wax is found to %0a%3c produce mites, which are supposed to be the very smallest of %0a%3c all living creatures.

THOSE WHICH HAVE %0a%3c ItlfTS AND CKESTS. %0a%3c %0a%3c In addition to what is already stated, we will add an ac- %0a%3c count of every part of the body of an animal, taken limb by limb. %0a%3c %0a%3c All those which have blood, have a head as well. A small %0a%3c number of animals, and those only among the birds, have %0a%3c tufts of various kinds upon the head. The phoenix^' has a %0a%3c long row of feathers on it, from the middle of which arises %0a%3c another row ; peacocks have a hairy tuft, resembling a bushy %0a%3c shrub ; the stymphalis*" has a sort of pointed crest, and the %0a%3c pheasant, again, small horns. Added to these, there is the lark, %0a%3c a little bird, which, from the appearance of its tuft, was %0a%3c formerly called " galerita," but has since received the %0a%3c Gallic name of " alauda,"" a name which it has transferred to %0a%3c one of our legions.^^ We have already made mention, also, %0a%3c of one bird*^ to which K^ature has given a crest, which it can %0a%3c fold or unfold at pleasure : the birds of the coot kind*'* have %0a%3c also received from her a crest, which takes its rise at the %0a%3c beak, and runs along the middle of the head ; while the pie %0a%3c of Mars, and the Balearic crane, are furnished with pointed %0a%3c tufts. But the most remarkable feature of all, is the crest %0a%3c which we see attached to the heads of our domestic fowls, %0a%3c substantial and indented like a saw ; we cannot, in fact, %0a%3c strictly caU it flesh, nor can we pronounce it to be cartilage %0a%3c or a callosity, but must admit that it is something of a nature %0a%3c peculiar to itself. As to the crests of di'agons, there is no one %0a%3c to be found who ever saw one. %0a%3c %0a%3c *^ They only appear to be so, from the peculiar streaks on the eyes. %0a%3c Linnaeus has hence called one variety, the Tabanus caecutiens. %0a%3c %0a%3c '8 Or with pounded chalk or whitening. -Lilian adds, "if they are placed %0a%3c in the sun," which appears necessary for the full success of the experiment. %0a%3c Life appears to be suspended in such cases for a period of surprising length. %0a%3c %0a%3c *^ Probably the golden pheasant, as already mentioned. %0a%3c Some kind of neron or crane, Cuvier thinks. %0a%3c %0a%3c 6' The Alauda cristata of Linnseus, so called from " galera," a pointed %0a%3c cap like a helmet. %0a%3c %0a%3c 62 The fiftb legion. 63 The hoopoe, B. x. c. 44. %0a%3c %0a%3c " Savigny and Cu'^ier take this to be the Ardea virgo of Linnaeus, a %0a%3c native of Numidia. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 44 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Flint's natural iiistoet. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XI. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 45.

ANIMALS IN WHICH %0a%3c %0a%3c XHEr ARE MOVKABLE. %0a%3c %0a%3c Horns, too, of various forms have been granted to many %0a%3c animals of the aquatic, marine, and reptile kind, but those %0a%3c which are more properly understood under that name belong %0a%3c to the quadrupeds only ; for I look upon the tales of Actaeon %0a%3c and of Cippus even, in Latin story, as nothing more nor less than %0a%3c fables.^ And, indeed, in no department of her works has %0a%3c Nature displayed a greater capriciousness. In providing ani- %0a%3c mals with these weapons, she has made merry at their ex- %0a%3c pense ; for some she has spread them out in branches, the %0a%3c stag, for instance ; to others she has given them in a more %0a%3c simple form, as in the " subulo," so called from the resem- %0a%3c blance of its horns to a " subula,"*"' or shoemaker's awl. In %0a%3c others, again, she has flattened them in the shape of a man's %0a%3c hand, with the fingers extended, fi-om which circumstance the %0a%3c animal has received the name of " platyceros."*' To the roe- %0a%3c buck she has given branching horns, but small, and has made %0a%3c them so as not to fall off and be cast each year ; while to the %0a%3c ram she has given them of a contorted and spiral form, as %0a%3c though she were providing it with a caestus for offence. The %0a%3c horns of the bull, again, are upright and threatening. In this %0a%3c last kind, the females, too, are provided with them, while in %0a%3c most it is only the males. The chamois has them, curving %0a%3c backwards ; while in the fallow deer®® they bend forward. %0a%3c The strepsiceros,^'" which in Africa bears the name of addax, has %0a%3c horns erect and spiral, grooved and tapering to a sharp point, %0a%3c so much so, that you would almost take them to be the sides %0a%3c of a lyro.''^* In the oxen of Phrygia, the horns are moveable,'' %0a%3c %0a%3c 65 The suddenness of their appearance, no doubt, was fabulous ; but we %0a%3c have well-authenticated cases in recent times of substances growing on the %0a%3c human head, to all appearance resembling horns, and arising from a dis- %0a%3c ordered secretion of the hair. Witness the case of Mary Davies, a so- %0a%3c called horn from whose head is preserved in the Ashmolean Museum at %0a%3c Oxford.

In one kind, also, the horns are used for the purpose %0a%3c of scratching the body, instead of hands. %0a%3c %0a%3c In snails the horns are fleshy, and are thus adapted for the %0a%3c purpose of feeling the way, which is also the case with the ce- %0a%3c rastes ; " some reptiles, again, have only one horn, though the %0a%3c snail has always two, suited for protruding and withdrawing. %0a%3c The barbarous nations of the north drink from the horns of the %0a%3c urus," a pair of which will hold a couple of um£e other %0a%3c tribes, again, point their spears with them. With us they are %0a%3c cut into lamina), upon which they become transparent ; indeed, %0a%3c the rays of a light placed within them may be seen to a much %0a%3c greater distance than without. They are used also for various %0a%3c appliances of luxury, either coloured or varnished, or else %0a%3c for those kinds of paintings which are known as " cestrota,"'® %0a%3c or horn-pictures. The horns of all animals are hollow within, %0a%3c it being only at the tip that they are solid : the only excep- %0a%3c tion is the stag, the horn of which is solid throughout, and %0a%3c is cast every year. When the hoofs of oxen are worn to the %0a%3c quick, the husbandmen have a method of curing them, by %0a%3c anointing the horns of the animal with grease. The substance %0a%3c of the horns is so ductile, that even while upon the body of %0a%3c the living animal, they can be bent by being steeped in boil- %0a%3c ing wax, and if they are split down when they are first shoot- %0a%3c ing, they may be twisted different ways, and so appear to be %0a%3c %0a%3c ■Ji B. viii.cc.29— 31. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Coluber cerastes of Linnaeus.

To the %0a%3c beasts that are cloven-footed Nature has granted two horns, %0a%3c but to those that have fore-teeth in the upper jaw, she has %0a%3c given none. Those persons who entertain the notion that the %0a%3c substance of these teeth is expended in the formation of the %0a%3c horns, are easily to be refuted, if we only consider the case of %0a%3c the hind, which has no more teeth than the male, and 5-et %0a%3c is without horns altogether. In the stag the horn is only %0a%3c imbedded in the skin, but in the other" animals it adheres to %0a%3c the bone. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 46. THE HEADS OP ANIMALS. THOSE WHICH HAVE NOSF. %0a%3c %0a%3c The head of the fish is very large in proportion to the rest %0a%3c of the body, probably, to facilitate its diving under water. %0a%3c Animals of the oyster and the sponge kind have no head, %0a%3c which is the case, also, with most of the other kinds, whose %0a%3c only sense is that of touch. Some, again, have the head %0a%3c blended with the body, the crab, for instance. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 47. THE HAIR. %0a%3c %0a%3c Of all animals man has the longest hair upon the head ; which %0a%3c is the case more especially with those nations where the men and %0a%3c women in common leave the hair to grow, and do not cut it. %0a%3c Indeed, it is from this fact, that the inhabitants of the Alps %0a%3c have obtained from us the name of " Capillati,"'* as also those %0a%3c of Gallia, " Comata."'^ There is, however, a great difference %0a%3c in this respect according to the various countries.

It is %0a%3c but rarely that the hair falls off in women, and in eunuchs %0a%3c such is never known to be the case ; nor yet does any person %0a%3c lose it before having known sexual intercourse.®^ The hair %0a%3c does not fall off below the brain, nor yet beneath the crown of %0a%3c the head, or around the ears and the temples. Man is the %0a%3c only animal that becomes bald, with the exception, of course, %0a%3c of such animals as are naturally so. Man and the horse are %0a%3c the only creatures whose hair turns grey ; but with man this is %0a%3c always the case, fii'st in the fore-part of the head, and then in %0a%3c the hinder part. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 48. — THE BONES OF THE HEAD. %0a%3c %0a%3c Some few persons only are double- crowned. The bones of %0a%3c the head are flat, thin, devoid of marrow, and united with su- %0a%3c tures indented like a comb. When broken asunder they can- %0a%3c not be united, but the extraction of a small portion is not ne- %0a%3c cessarily fatal, as a fleshy cicatrix forms, and so makes good %0a%3c the loss. We have already mentioned, in their respective** %0a%3c places, that the skull of the bear is the weakest of all, and %0a%3c that of the parrot the hardest. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 49. THE BEAIN. %0a%3c %0a%3c The brain exists in all animals which have blood, and in %0a%3c those sea animals as well, which we have already mentioned %0a%3c as mollusks, although they are destitute of blood, the poly- %0a%3c pus, for instance. Man, however, has, in proportion to his %0a%3c body, the most voluminous brain of all. This, too, is the %0a%3c most humid, and the coldest of all the viscera, and is enve- %0a%3c loped above and below with two membranous integuments, %0a%3c for either of which to be broken is fatal. In addition to these %0a%3c facts, we may remark that the brain is larger in men than iu %0a%3c %0a%3c «i Sec B. v. c. 29. %0a%3c %0a%3c %3c^a\aKpoKupa^. See B. X.

Man is the only ani- %0a%3c mal in which it is kno-svn to palpitate"^ during infancy ; and %0a%3c it does not gain its proper consistency until after the child has %0a%3c made its first attempt to speak. The brain is the most ele- %0a%3c vated of all the viscera, and the nearest to the roof of the %0a%3c head ; it is equally devoid of flesh, blood, and excretions. The %0a%3c senses hold this organ as their citadel ; it is in this that %0a%3c are centred all the veins which spring from the heart ; it is %0a%3c here that they terminate ; this is the very culminating point of %0a%3c all, the regulator of the understanding. "With all animals it %0a%3c is advanced to the fore-part of the head, from the fact that %0a%3c the senses have a tendency to the direction in which we look. %0a%3c From the brain proceeds sleep, and its return it is that causes %0a%3c the head to nod. Those creatures, in fact, which have no brain, %0a%3c never sleep. It is said that stags^^ have in the head certain %0a%3c small maggots, twenty in number : they are situate in the %0a%3c empty space that lies beneath the tongue, and around the joints %0a%3c by which the head is united to the body. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 50. — THE EAKS. ANIMALS WHICH HEAB WITHOUT EiES %0a%3c Oil APERTXJKES. %0a%3c %0a%3c Man is the only animal the ears of which are immoveable. %0a%3c It is from the natural flaccidity of the ear, that the surname %0a%3c of Flaccus is derived. There is no part of the body that %0a%3c creates a more enormous expense for our women, in the %0a%3c pearls which are suspended from them. In the East, too, it %0a%3c is thought highly becoming for the men, even, to wear gold %0a%3c rings in their ears. Some animals have large, and others %0a%3c small ears. The stag alone has them cut and divided, as it %0a%3c were ; in the field-mouse they have a velvet surface. AU the %0a%3c animals that are viviparous have ears of some kind or other, %0a%3c with the sole exception of the sea-calf, the dolphin, the fishes %0a%3c %0a%3c 85 See B. vii. c. 1. %0a%3c %0a%3c 65 Cuvier says that fhese are the larvae of the oestrus, which are deposited %0a%3c on the lips of quadrupeds, and so make their way to various cavities. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Cbap. 02.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c TUE ElES. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 49 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c which we have mentioned^' as cartilaginous, and the viper. %0a%3c These animals have only cavities instead of ears, with the ex- %0a%3c ception of the cartilaginous fishes and the dolphin, which last, %0a%3c however, it is quite clear possesses the sense of hearing, for it is %0a%3c charmed by singing, and is often taken while enraptured with %0a%3c the melody: how it is that it does hear, is quite marvellous. %0a%3c These animals, too, have not the slightest trace of olfactory %0a%3c organs, and yet they have a most acute sense of smell. %0a%3c %0a%3c Among the winged animals, only the horned owl and the long- %0a%3c eared owl have feathers which project like ears, the rest having %0a%3c only cavities for the purpose of hearing ; the same is the case, %0a%3c also, with the scaly animals and the serpents. Among horses %0a%3c and beasts of burden of all kinds, it is the ears which indicate %0a%3c the natural feelings; when the animal is weary, they are droop- %0a%3c ing and flaccid ; when it is startled, they quiver to and fro ; %0a%3c when it is enraged, they are pricked up ; and when it is ailing, %0a%3c they are pendant. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 51. — THE FACE, THE FOKEHEAD, AND THE ETE-BEOWS. %0a%3c %0a%3c Man is the only creature that has a face, the other animals %0a%3c having only a muzzle or a beak. Other animals have a fore- %0a%3c head as well, but it is only on the forehead of man that is %0a%3c depicted sorrow, gladness, compassion, or severity. It is the %0a%3c forehead that is the index of the mind. Man has eyebrows, %0a%3c also, which move together or alternately ; these, too, serve in %0a%3c some measure as indications of the feelings. Do we deny or %0a%3c do we assent, it is the eyebrows, mostly, that indicate our %0a%3c intentions. Feelings of pride may be generated elsewhere, %0a%3c but it is here that they have their principal abode ; it is in the %0a%3c heart that they take their rise, but it is to the eyebrows that %0a%3c they mount, and here they take up their position. In no part %0a%3c of the body could they meet with a spot more lofty and more %0a%3c precipitous, in which to establish themselves free from aU %0a%3c control. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 52.

Eyes, %0a%3c however, have not been granted to all animals ; oysters have %0a%3c none, but, with reference to some of the shell-fish, the question %0a%3c is still doubtful ; for if we move the fingers before a scallop %0a%3c half open, it will immediately close its shell, apparently from %0a%3c seeing them, while the solen^^ will start away from an iron %0a%3c instrument when placed near it. Among quadrupeds the %0a%3c mole*' has no sight, though it has something that bears a re- %0a%3c semblance to eyes, if we remove the membrane that is ex- %0a%3c tended in front of them. Among birds also, it is said that %0a%3c a species of heron, which is known as the "leucus,"^ is %0a%3c wanting of one eye : a bird of most excellent augury, when %0a%3c it flies towards the south or north, for it is said that it %0a%3c portends thereby that there is about to be an end of perils and %0a%3c alarms. Nigidius says also, that neither locusts nor grass- %0a%3c hoppers have eyes. In snails,**^ the two small horns with which %0a%3c they feel their way, perform the duties of eyes. Neither tlie %0a%3c mawworm^- nor any other kind of worm has eyes. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 53. — THE DIVEESITY OF THE COLOUK OF THE EYES. %0a%3c %0a%3c The eyes vary in colour in the human race only ; in all %0a%3c other animals they are of one uniform colour peculiar to the %0a%3c kind, though there are some horses that have eyes of an azure %0a%3c colour. But in man the varieties and diversities are most %0a%3c numerous ; the eyes being either large, of middling size, re- %0a%3c markably small, or remarkably prominent. These last are %0a%3c generally supposed to be very weak, while those which are %0a%3c deep-seated are considered the best, as is the case also with %0a%3c those which in colour resemble the eyes of the goat. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 54.

The %0a%3c vision of many stands in need of the rays of the sun ; such %0a%3c persons cannot see on a cloudy day, nor yet after the sun has %0a%3c set. Others, again, have bad sight in the day-time, but a %0a%3c sight superior to that of others by night. Of persons having %0a%3c double pupils, or the evil eye, we have already spoken'^ at %0a%3c sufficient length. Blue^* eyes are the best for seeing in the %0a%3c dark. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is said that Tiberius Caesar, like no other human being, %0a%3c was so endowed by Nature, that on awaking in the night** he %0a%3c could for a few moments distinguish objects just as well as %0a%3c in the clearest daylight, but that by degrees he would find %0a%3c his sight again enveloped in darkness. The late Emperor %0a%3c Augustus had azure eyes like those of some horses, the white %0a%3c being larger than with other men ; he used to be verj' angry %0a%3c if a person stared intently at them for this peculiarity. Claudius %0a%3c Caesar had at the corners of the eyes a white fleshy substance, %0a%3c covered with veins, which would occasionally become sufi'used %0a%3c with blood ; with the Emperor Caius* they had a fixed, steady %0a%3c gaze, while Nero could see nothing distinctly without wink- %0a%3c ing, and having it brought close to his eyes. The Emperor %0a%3c Caius had twenty pairs of gladiators in his training-school, %0a%3c and of all these there were only two who did not wink the %0a%3c eyes when a menacing gesture was made close to them : hence %0a%3c it was that these men were invincible. So difficult a matter is %0a%3c it for a man to keep his eyes from winking : indeed, to wink is %0a%3c so natural to many, that they cannot desist from it ; such per- %0a%3c sons we generally look upon as the most timid. %0a%3c %0a%3c No persons have the eye all of one colour ; that of the %0a%3c middle of the eye is always different from the white which %0a%3c surrounds it. In all animals there is no part^in the whole %0a%3c body that is a stronger exponent of the feelings, and in man %0a%3c more especially, for it is from the expression of the eye that %0a%3c we detect clemency, moderation, compassion, hatred, love, %0a%3c sadness, and joy. From the eyes, too, the various characters %0a%3c of persons are judged of, according as they are ferocious, me- %0a%3c %0a%3c 93 B. vii. c. 2. 9* " Caesii." %0a%3c %0a%3c ^ The same has been said also of Cardan, the elder Scaliger, Theodore %0a%3c Beza, the French physician Mairan, auJ tlie republican Camille Desmoulins. , %0a%3c s** Caligula. %0a%3c %0a%3c E 2 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 52 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c PLINr's NATUKAl HTSTOBT. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XI. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c iiacing, sparkling, sedate, leering, askance, downcast, or Ian- %0a%3c guishing. Beyond a doubt it is in the eyes that the mind has %0a%3c its abode : sometimes the look is ardent, sometimes fixed and %0a%3c steady, at other times the eyes are humid, and at others, again, %0a%3c half closed. From these it is that the tears of pity flow, and %0a%3c when we kiss them we seem to be touching the very soul. It %0a%3c is the eyes that weep, and from them proceed those streams %0a%3c that moisten our cheeks as they trickle down. And what is %0a%3c this liquid that is always so ready and in such abundance in %0a%3c our moments of grief, and where is it kept in reserve at other %0a%3c times ? It is by the aid of the mind that we see, by the aid %0a%3c of the mind that we enjoy perception ; while the eyes, like so %0a%3c many vessels, as it were, receive its visual faculties and trans- %0a%3c mit them. Hence it is that profound thought renders a man %0a%3c blind for the time, the powers of sight being withdrawn fi'om %0a%3c external objects and thrown inward : so, too, in epilepsy, the %0a%3c mind is covered with darkness, while the eyes, though open, %0a%3c are able to see nothing. In addition to this, it is the fact %0a%3c that hares, as well as many human beings, can sleep with %0a%3c the eyes open, a thing which the Greeks express by the term %0a%3c zopy^avriav. Nature has composed the eye of numerous mem- %0a%3c branes of remarkable thinness, covering them with a thick coat %0a%3c to ensure their protection against heat and cold. This coat she %0a%3c purifies from time to time by the lachrymal humours, and she %0a%3c has made the surface lubricous and slippery, to protect the eye %0a%3c against the efi'ects of a sudden shock. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 55. THE NATUEE OF THE PUPIL EXES WHICH DO KOT %0a%3c %0a%3c SHUT. %0a%3c %0a%3c In the midst of the cornea of the eye Nature has formed a %0a%3c window in the pupil, the small dimensions of which do not %0a%3c permit the si^ht to wander at hazard and with uncertainty, %0a%3c but direct it as straight as though it were through a tuhe, %0a%3c and at the same time ensure its avoidance of all shocks com- %0a%3c municated by foreign bodies. The pupils are surrounded by a %0a%3c black circle in some persons, while it is of a yellowish cast with %0a%3c others, and azure again with others. By this happy combina- %0a%3c tion the light is received by the eye upon the white that lies %0a%3c around the pupU, and its reflection being thus tempered, it %0a%3c fails to impede or confuse the sight by its harshness. So %0a%3c complete a mirror, too, does the eye form, that the pupil, %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 55.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c THE NATtrnE OF THE PUPIL. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 53 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c small as it is, is able to reflect the entire image of a man. %0a%3c This^ is the reason why most birds, when held in the hand %0a%3c of a person, will more particularly peck at his eyes ; for seeing %0a%3c their own likeness reflected in the pupils, they are attracted to %0a%3c it by what seem to be the objects of their natural affection. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is only some few beasts of burden that are subject to %0a%3c maladies of the eyes towards the increase of the moon : but it %0a%3c is man alone that is rescued from blindness by the discharge %0a%3c of the humours* that have caused it. Many persons have %0a%3c had their sight restored after being blind for twenty years ; %0a%3c while others, again, have been denied this blessing from their %0a%3c very birth, without there being any blemish in the eyes. Many %0a%3c persons, again, have suddenly lost tneir sight from no apparent %0a%3c cause, and without any preceding injury. The most learned %0a%3c authors say that there are veins which communicate from the %0a%3c eye to the brain, but I am inclined to think that the communi- %0a%3c cation is with the stomach ; for it is quite certain that a person %0a%3c never loses the ej'e without feeling sickness at the stomach. It %0a%3c is an important and sacred duty, of high sanction among the %0a%3c Romans, to close the eyes of the dead, and then again to open %0a%3c them when the body is laid on the funeral pile, the usage %0a%3c having taken its rise in the notion of its being improper - that %0a%3c the eyes of the dead should be beheld by man, Avhile it is an %0a%3c equally great offence to hide them from the view of heaven. %0a%3c Man is the only living creature the eyes of which are subject %0a%3c to deformities, from which, in fact, arose the family names of %0a%3c " Strabo"^ and " Psetus." ^ The ancients used to call a man %0a%3c who was born with only one eye, "codes," and " ocella," a %0a%3c person whose eyes were remarkably small. " Luscinus" was %0a%3c the surname given to one who happened to have lost one eye %0a%3c by an accident. %0a%3c %0a%3c The eyes of animals that see at night in the dark, cats, for %0a%3c instance, are shining and radiant, so much so, that it is impos- %0a%3c sible to look upon them ; those of the she-goat, too, and the %0a%3c wolf are resplendent, and emit a light like fire. The eyes of %0a%3c the sea-calf and the hy£ena change successively to a thousand %0a%3c %0a%3c ^ Hardouin witli justice doubts the soundness of this alleged reason. %0a%3c He alludes, probably, to some method of curing cataract; perhaps %0a%3c somewhat similar to that mentioned by him in B. xx. c. 20. %0a%3c %0a%3c This was done by the nearest relatives. This usage still prevails in %0a%3c this country, the eyelids being pressed down with pieces of gold or silver. %0a%3c ^ Or "squint-eyed." 2 Or "cock-eyed," %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 51 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c PLIKT's NATirEAL HISTOET. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XI. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c colours ; and the eyes, when dried, of most of the fishes will %0a%3c give out light in the dark, just in the same way as the trunk %0a%3c of the oak when it has become rotten with extreme old age. %0a%3c We have already mentioned^ the fact, that animals which turn, %0a%3c not the eyes but the head, for the purpose of looking round, %0a%3c are never known to wink. It is said,* too, that the chame- %0a%3c leon is able to roll the eye-balls completely round. Crabs look %0a%3c sideways, and have the eyes enclosed beneath a thin crust. %0a%3c Those of craw-fish and shrimps are very hard and prominent, %0a%3c and lie in a great measure beneath a defence of a similar %0a%3c nature. Those animals, however, the eyes of which are hard, %0a%3c have worse sight than those of which the eyes are formed of a %0a%3c humid substance. It is said that if the eyes are taken away %0a%3c from the young of serpents and of the swallow,^ they will grow %0a%3c again. In all insects and in animals covered with a shell, the %0a%3c eyes move just in the same way as the ears of quadrupeds do; %0a%3c those among them which have a brittle® covering have the %0a%3c eyes hard. All animals of this nature, as well as fishes and %0a%3c insects, are destitute of eye-lids, and their eyes have no cover- %0a%3c ing ; but in all there is a membrane that is transparent like %0a%3c glass, spread over them. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 56. — THE HAIU OF THE EYE-LIDS ; WHAT ANIMALS AEE %0a%3c WITHOUT THEM. ANIMALS WHICH CAN SEE ON ONE SIDE ONLY. %0a%3c %0a%3c Man has lashes on the eye-lids on either side ; and women %0a%3c even make it their daily care to stain them ;'' so ardent are they %0a%3c in the pursuit of beauty, that they must even colour their %0a%3c very eyes. It was with another view, however, that Nature %0a%3c had provided the hair of the eyelids — they were to have acted, %0a%3c so to say, as a kind of rampart for the protection of the sight, %0a%3c and as an advanced bulwark against the approach of insects %0a%3c or other objects which might accidentally come in their way. %0a%3c It is not without some reason that it is said that the eye- %0a%3c lashes^ fall off' with those persons who are too much given to %0a%3c venereal pleasures.

The ostrich is the only one among the birds %0a%3c that, like man, has eyelashes on either side. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAT. 57. ANIMALS WHICH HATE NO EYELIDS. %0a%3c %0a%3c All birds, however, have not eyelids: hence it is, that %0a%3c those which are viviparous have no nictation of the eye. %0a%3c The heavier kinds of birds shut the eye by means of the %0a%3c lower eyelid, and they wink by drawing forward a mem- %0a%3c brane which lies in the corner of the eye. Pigeons, and other %0a%3c birds of a similar nature, shut the two eyelids ; but the quad- %0a%3c rupeds which are oviparous, such, for instance, as the tortoise %0a%3c and the crocodile, have only the lower eyelid moveable, and %0a%3c never wink, in consequence of the hardness of the eye. The %0a%3c edge of the upper eyelid was by the ancients called " cilium," %0a%3c from which comes our word " supercilia.^" If the eyelid %0a%3c happens to be severed by a wound it will not reunite,'" which %0a%3c is the case also with some few other parts of the human body. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 58. — THE CHEEKS. %0a%3c %0a%3c Below the eyes are the cheeks, a feature which is found %0a%3c in man only. From the ancients they received the name of %0a%3c " gense," and by the laws of the Twelve Tables, women were %0a%3c forbidden to tear them." The cheeks are the seat of %0a%3c bashfulness ; it is on them more particularly that blushes are %0a%3c to be seen. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 59.

All animals that are viviparous %0a%3c have a mouth that is either well-formed, or harshly defined, %0a%3c as the case may be. Instead of lips and mouth, the birds %0a%3c have a beak that is horny and sharp at the end. With birds %0a%3c that live by rapine, the beak is hooked inwards, but with those %0a%3c which gather and peck only, it is straight : those animals, %0a%3c again, which root up grass or puddle in the mud, have the %0a%3c muzzle broad, like swine. The beasts of burden employ the %0a%3c mouth in place of hands in gathering their food, while those %0a%3c which live by rapine and slaughter have it wider than the %0a%3c rest. No animal, with the exception of man, has either chin %0a%3c or cheek-bones.

In some creatures %0a%3c they are set in one continuous row, man and the horse, %0a%3c for instance; while in the wild boar, the elephant, and the %0a%3c hippopotamus, they protrude from the mouth," Among those %0a%3c set in one continuous row, the teeth which divide the food %0a%3c are broad and sharp, while those which grind it are double ; %0a%3c the teeth which lie between the incisive and the molar %0a%3c teeth, are those known as the canine or dog-teeth; these %0a%3c %0a%3c 13 " Flat-nosed," and " snub-nosed," %0a%3c %0a%3c " A Roman family— the reading of this word seems doubtful. %0a%3c %0a%3c 15 In reality, the under one only. %0a%3c %0a%3c 16 He is incorrect in speaking of dogs as having serrated teeth. %0a%3c " In the dugoag also, babiroussa, muntjac, and others. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 62.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c THE TEETH OF SEEPEI^TS. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 57 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c are by far the largest in those animals which have serrated %0a%3c teeth. Those -animals which have continuous rows of teeth, %0a%3c have them either situate on both sides of the mouth, as in %0a%3c the horse, or else have no fore-teeth in the upper part of the %0a%3c mouth, as is the case with oxen, sheep, and all the animals %0a%3c that ruminate. The she-goat has no upper teeth, except the %0a%3c two front ones. No animals which have serrated teeth, have %0a%3c them protruding'^ from the mouth ; among these, too, the fe- %0a%3c males rarely have them ; and to those that do have them, they %0a%3c are of no " use : hence it is, that while the boar strikes, the %0a%3c sow bites. No animal with horns has projecting teeth ; and %0a%3c all such teeth are hollow, while in other animals the teeth are %0a%3c solid. All-" fish have the teeth serrated, with the exception %0a%3c of the scarus,'*' this being the only one among the aquatic %0a%3c animals that has them level-' at the edges. In addition to %0a%3c this, there are many fishes that have teeth upon the tongue %0a%3c and over the whole of the mouth, in order that, by the multi- %0a%3c tude of the bites which they inflict, they may soften those %0a%3c articles of food which they could not possibly manage by %0a%3c tearing. Many animals, also, have teeth in the palate, and %0a%3c even in the tail ; in addition to which, some have them in- %0a%3c clining to the interior of the mouth, that the food may not %0a%3c fall out, the animal itself having no other means of retaining %0a%3c it there. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 62.

The writers who have made the most %0a%3c diUgent enquiries on the subject, inform us that this venom is %0a%3c nothing but the gall of the serpent, and that it is convoyed %0a%3c to the mouth by certain veins which run beneath the spine; %0a%3c indeed, there are some who state that there is only one poison- %0a%3c fang, and that being barbed at the end, it is bent backwards %0a%3c when the animal has inflicted a bite. Other writers, however, %0a%3c affirm that on such an occasion the fang falls out, as it is very %0a%3c easily displaced, but that it soon grows^* again; this tooth, %0a%3c they say, is thus wanting in the serpents which we see %0a%3c handled about by persons.^^ It is also stated that this fang %0a%3c exists in the tail of the scorpion, and that most of these animals %0a%3c have no less than three. The teeth of the viper are concealed %0a%3c in the gums : the animal, being provided with a similar venom, %0a%3c exercises the pressure of its fangs for the purpose of instilling %0a%3c the poison in its bite. %0a%3c %0a%3c No Avinged creatures have teeth, with the sole exception of %0a%3c the bat. The camel is the only one among the animals with- %0a%3c out horns, that has no fore-teeth ^® in the upper jaw. None of %0a%3c the horned animals have serrated teeth. Snails, too, have %0a%3c teeth ; a proof of which are the vetches which we find gnawed %0a%3c away by snails of the very smallest size. To assert that among %0a%3c marine animals, those that have shells, and those that are %0a%3c cartilaginous have fore-teeth, and that the sea-urchin has five %0a%3c teeth, I am very much surprised how such a notion could have %0a%3c possibly-® arisen. "With insects the sting supplies the place of %0a%3c teeth ; the ape has teeth just like those in man.^^ The elephant %0a%3c %0a%3c ^ There is always one fang, at least, ready to supply the place of the one %0a%3c in front, if lost by any accident. %0a%3c %0a%3c " Like the jugglers of the East at the present day.

The sea-mouse,^" a fish which goes be- %0a%3c fore the balaena, has no teeth at all, but in place of them, the %0a%3c interior of the mouth is lined with bristles, as well as the tongue %0a%3c and palate.

WONDERFUL CIECTJMSTANCES CONKECTED WITH THE %0a%3c %0a%3c TEETH. %0a%3c %0a%3c The other animals are born with^^ teeth, whereas man has %0a%3c them only at the seventh month after his birth. "While %0a%3c other animals keep their teeth to the time of their death, %0a%3c man, the lion, the beasts of burden, the dog, and the rumi- %0a%3c nating animals, all change them ; the lion and the dog, how- %0a%3c ever, change none''* but the canine teeth. The canine tooth of %0a%3c the wolf, on the right side, is held in high esteem as an amulet.'* %0a%3c There is no animal that changes the maxillary teeth, which %0a%3c stand beyond the canine teeth. With man, the last teeth, %0a%3c which are known as the " genuini," or cheek teeth, ^® come %0a%3c about the twentieth year, and with many men, and females as %0a%3c well, so late even as the eightieth ; but this only in the case %0a%3c of those who have not had them in their youth. It is a %0a%3c well-known fact, that the teeth are sometimes shed in old age, %0a%3c and replaced by others. Mucianus has stated that he, himself, %0a%3c saw one Zocles, a native of Samothrace, who had a new set of %0a%3c teeth when he was past his one hundred and fourth year. In %0a%3c addition to these facts, in man males have more teeth than %0a%3c females,^' which is the case also in sheep, goats, and swine. %0a%3c %0a%3c 30 See B. ix. c. 88. %0a%3c %0a%3c 31 Very few other animals are born with teeth, in their natural state. %0a%3c Apes, dogs, and cats are not born with teeth. %0a%3c %0a%3c 32 From the fourth to the eighth month in reality, during which the %0a%3c four central incisors appear. %0a%3c %0a%3c 3» The only ones that do not change are those which have three molars %0a%3c on each side of the jaw. %0a%3c 31 This is erroneous : they change the incisors and molars as well. %0a%3c %0a%3c 35 See B. xxviii. c. 78. %0a%3c %0a%3c 36 By us known as the "wisdom" teeth. %0a%3c %0a%3c " This is not the fact : they have usually the same number, but there %0a%3c are exceptions on both sides.

HOW AN ESTIMATE IS FORMEI) OF THE AGE %0a%3c %0a%3c OF ANIMALS FROM THEIK TEETH. %0a%3c %0a%3c The age, in beasts of burden,*' is indicated by the teeth. In %0a%3c the horse they are forty in number. At thirty months it %0a%3c loses the two fore-teeth in either jaw, and in the following year %0a%3c the same number next to them, at the time that the eye-teeth** %0a%3c come. At the beginning of the fifth year the animal loses two %0a%3c teeth, which grow again in the sixth, and in the seventh it has %0a%3c all its teeth, those which have replaced the others, and those %0a%3c "which have never been changed. If a horse is gelded^^ before %0a%3c it changes its teeth, it never sheds them. In a similar manner, %0a%3c also, the ass loses four of its teeth in the thirtieth month, and %0a%3c the others from six months to six months. If a she-ass hap- %0a%3c pens not to have foaled before the last of these teeth are shed, %0a%3c it is sure to be barren.** Oxen change their teeth at two years %0a%3c old: with swine they are never changed." When these %0a%3c several indications of age have been lost in horses and other %0a%3c beasts of burden, the age is ascertained by the projecting of %0a%3c the teeth, the greyness of the hair in the eyebrows, and the %0a%3c hollow pits that form around them ; at this period the animal %0a%3c is supposed to be about sixteen*^ years old.

THE PALATE. %0a%3c %0a%3c The tongue is not similarly formed in all animals. Ser- %0a%3c pents have a very thin tongue, and three-forked,*'* which they %0a%3c vibrate to and fro : it is of a black colour, and when drawn %0a%3c from out of the mouth, of extraordinary length. The tongue %0a%3c of the lizard is two-forked, and covered with hair.* That of %0a%3c the sea-calf also is twofold,*' but with the serpents it is of the %0a%3c thinness of a hair ; the other animals employ it to lick the %0a%3c parts around the mouth. Fishes have nearly the whole of the %0a%3c tongue adhering to the palate, while in the crocodile the whole %0a%3c of it does adhere thereto : but in the aquatic animals the palate, %0a%3c which is fleshy, performs the duty of the tongue as the organ %0a%3c of taste. In lions, pards, and all the animals of that class, %0a%3c and in cats as well, the tongue is covered with asperities,*^ %0a%3c which overlap each other, and bear a strong resemblance to a %0a%3c rasp. Such being its formation, if the animal licks a man's skin, %0a%3c it will wear it away by making it thinner and thinner ; for %0a%3c which reason it is that the saliva of even a perfectly tame %0a%3c animal, being thus introduced to the close vicinity of the blood, %0a%3c is apt to bring on madness. Of the tongue of the purple we %0a%3c have made mention*^ already.

In making this noise, the folds of the mouth, becoming %0a%3c distended, are quite transparent, and the eyes start from the %0a%3c head and burn again with the effort. Those insects which %0a%3c have a sting in the lower part of the body, have teeth, and a %0a%3c tongue as well ; with bees it is of considerable length, and in %0a%3c the grasshopper it is very prominent. Those insects which have %0a%3c a fistulous sting in the mouth, have neither tongue nor teeth ; %0a%3c while others, again, have a tongue in the interior of the mouth, %0a%3c the ant, for instance. In the elephant the tongue is remark- %0a%3c ably broad ; and while with all other animals, each according %0a%3c to -its kind, it is always perfectly at liberty, with man, and %0a%3c him alone, it is often found so strongly tied down by certain %0a%3c veins, that it becomes necessary to cut them. "We find it %0a%3c stated that the pontiff Metellus had a tongue so ill adapted for %0a%3c articulation, that he is generally supposed to have voluntarily %0a%3c submitted to torture for many months, while preparing to %0a%3c pronounce the speech which he was about to make on the de- %0a%3c dication of the temple of Opifera.*" In most persons the %0a%3c tongue is able to articulate with distinctness at about the %0a%3c seventh year ; and many know how to employ it with such re- %0a%3c markable skill, as to be able to imitate the voices of various %0a%3c birds and other animals with the greatest exactness.

In those %0a%3c which have a neck, it is formed of several rounded vertebrse, %0a%3c and is flexible, and joined together by distinct articulations, to %0a%3c allow of the animal turning round the head to look.

Still, however the heart has not always been con- %0a%3c sidered as forming a part of the entrails for this purpose. It %0a%3c was under Lucius Postumius Albinus, the King of the Sacri- %0a%3c fices," and after the 126th Olympiad, w^hen King Pyi-rhushad %0a%3c quitted Italy, that the aruspices began to examine the heart, %0a%3c as part of the consecrated entrails. The first day that the %0a%3c Dictator Caesar appeared in public, clothed in purple, and bit- %0a%3c ting on a seat of gold, the heart was twice found wanting"* %0a%3c when he sacrificed. From tliis circumstance has risen a great %0a%3c question among those who discuss matters connected with %0a%3c divination — whether it was possible for the victim to have %0a%3c lived without that organ, or whether it had lost it at the very %0a%3c moment'^ of its death.

Some few %0a%3c among the aquatic animals have lungs, as we have already %0a%3c stated ; and among the rest of those which are oviparous, they %0a%3c are small, of a fungous nature, and containing no blood ; hence %0a%3c it is, that these animals do not experience thirst. It is for the %0a%3c same reason also, that frogs and seals are able to remain so %0a%3c long under water. The tortoise, too, although it has lungs of %0a%3c remarkable size, and extending throughout the whole of the %0a%3c shell, is also equally destitute of blood. The smaller the lungs %0a%3c are in proportion to the body, the greater is the swiftness of %0a%3c the animal.

No liver ^ at all was found in a %0a%3c victim which was sacrificed by M.

It was wanting, also, in a victim sacrificed by C. %0a%3c Marius, at Utica, and in one which was ofi'cred by the Emperor %0a%3c Caius**' upon the calends of January,®^' on the occasion of his en- %0a%3c tering the year of the consulship in which he was skin : the %0a%3c same thing happened, also, to his successor, Claudius, in the %0a%3c month in which he was cut off by poison. When the late %0a%3c Emperor Augustus was sacrificing at Spoletum, upon the first %0a%3c day of his entering on the imperial dignity, in six diff'erent %0a%3c victims the liver was found rolled over within itself, from the %0a%3c very lowest lobe ; and the answer that was given by the diviners %0a%3c was to the effect that, in the course of the j-ear, he would gain %0a%3c a twofold sway. It is of evil omen to find an incision in the %0a%3c head of the entrails, except on occasions of disquietude and %0a%3c alarm ; for then it is significant of cutting all cares, and so %0a%3c putting an end to them. The hares that are found in the %0a%3c vicinity of Briletum ®^ and Thame, and in the Chersonnesus %0a%3c on the Propontis, have a double liver; but, what is very %0a%3c singular, if they are removed to another place, they will lose %0a%3c one of them. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 74.

At Chalcis, in Euboea, none of the cattle have %0a%3c it, while in the cattle of the Isle of Naxos, it is of extraordi- %0a%3c nary size, and double, so that to a stranger either of these facts %0a%3c would appear as good as a prodigy.

There are some authors who say that %0a%3c the gall exists in the horse, not in the liver, but in the paunch, %0a%3c and that in the stag it is situate either in the tail or the %0a%3c intestines ; and that hence it is, that those parts are so bitter %0a%3c that dogs will not touch them. The gall, in fact, is nothing %0a%3c else but the worst parts of the blood purged off, and for this %0a%3c reason it is that it is so bitter : at all events, it is a well-known %0a%3c fact, that no animal has a liver unless it has blood as well. %0a%3c The liver receives the blood from the heart, to which it is %0a%3c united, and then disperses it in the veins. %0a%3c %0a%3c CnAP. 75. THE PKOPEKTIES OF THE GALL. %0a%3c %0a%3c A^Tien the gall is black, it is productive of madness in man, %0a%3c and if it is wholly expelled death will ensue. Hence it is, too, %0a%3c that the word " bile" has been employed by us to characterize %0a%3c a harsh, embittered disposition; so powerful are the effects %0a%3c of this secretion, when it extends its influence to the mind. %0a%3c In addition to this, Avhen it is dispersed over the whole of %0a%3c the body, it deprives the eyes, even, of their natural colour ; %0a%3c and when ejected, will tarnish copper vessels even, rendering %0a%3c everything black with which it comes in contact ; so that no %0a%3c one ought to be surprised that it is the gall which constitutes %0a%3c the venom of serpents. Those o,nimals of Pontus which feed %0a%3c on wormwood have no gall : in the raven, the quail, and the %0a%3c pheasant, the gall-bladder is united to the renal parts, and, on %0a%3c one side only, to the intestines. In many animals, again, it %0a%3c is united onlj' to the intestines, the pigeon, the hawk, and the %0a%3c murena, for example. In some few birds it is situate in the %0a%3c liver ; but it is in serpents and fishes that it is the largest in %0a%3c proportion. AVith the greater part of birds, it extends all along %0a%3c throughout the intestines, as in the hawk and the kite. In %0a%3c some other birds, also, it is situate in the breast as well : the %0a%3c gall, too, of the sea-calf is celebrated for its application to many %0a%3c purposes. From the gall of the bull a colour is extracted like %0a%3c that of gold. The'aruspices have consecrated the gall to Nep- %0a%3c tune and the influence of water. The Emperor Augustus %0a%3c found a double gall in a victim which he was sacrificing on %0a%3c the day of his victory at Actium. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 70 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c FLINT'S NATTTBAL HISTOBT. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XI. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c CHA.P. 76, — m WHAT ANIMALS THE XITER INCREASES AND DE- %0a%3c CREASES WITH THE MOON.

THE DIAPHRAGM. THE NATURE OF LAUGHTER. %0a%3c %0a%3c The entrails of serpents and lizards are of remarkable length. %0a%3c It is related that — a most fortunate omen — Csecina of Volaterrae %0a%3c beheld two dragons arising from the entrails of the victim ; %0a%3c and this will not be at all incredible, if we are ready to beUeve %0a%3c that while King Pyrrhus was sacrificing, the day upon which %0a%3c he died, the heads of the victims, on being cut off, crawled %0a%3c along the ground and licked up their own blood. In man, the %0a%3c entrails are separated from the lower part of the viscera by a %0a%3c certain membrane, which is called the " praecordia," ^ because %0a%3c it is extended in front of the heart ; the Greeks have given it %0a%3c the name of " phrenes." AU the principal viscera have been %0a%3c enclosed by Nature, in her prudent foresight, in their own pe- %0a%3c culiar membranes, just like so many sheaths, in fact. With re- %0a%3c ference to the diaphragm, there was a peculiar reason for this %0a%3c wise provision of Nature, its proximity to the guts, and the %0a%3c chances that the food might possibly intercept the respiration. %0a%3c It is to this organ that is attributed quick and ready wit, and %0a%3c hence it is that it has no fleshy parts, but is composed of line %0a%3c sinews and membranes. This part is also the chief seat of %0a%3c gaiety of mind, a fact which is more particularly proved by %0a%3c the titillation of the arm-holes, to which the midriff extends ; %0a%3c %0a%3c ^ There must he some corrupt reading here ; for, as Sillig remarks, %0a%3c who ever heard of a siege which, lasted a hundred years } %0a%3c %0a%3c 85 Or diaphragm; from "prce," "before," and " cor,'" the " heart." %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 79.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c THE INTESTINES. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 71 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c indeed, in no part of the body is the skin more fine ; for this %0a%3c reason it is, also, that we experience such peculiar pleasure in %0a%3c scratching the parts in its vicinity.

In other animals it is single, but in %0a%3c those which ruminate it is double ; in those, again, which %0a%3c are destitute of blood, there is no belly, for the intestinal %0a%3c canal commences in some of them at the mouth, and returns to %0a%3c that part, as is the case with the sa^pia and the polypus. In %0a%3c man it is connected with the extremity of the stomach, and %0a%3c the same with the dog. These are the only creatures that %0a%3c have the belly more narrow at the lower part ; hence it is, %0a%3c too, that they are the only ones that vomit, for on the beUy %0a%3c being filled, the narroAvness at its extremity precludes the food %0a%3c from passing ; a thing that cannot possibly be the case with %0a%3c the animals in M'hich the belly is more capacious at the ex- %0a%3c tremity, and so leaves a free passage for the food to the lower %0a%3c parts of the body. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 79.

Those animals which have the longest intestinal canal, %0a%3c are the most voracious ; and those which have the belly the %0a%3c most loaded with fat, are the least intelligent. There are %0a%3c some birds, also, which have two receptacles ; the one of %0a%3c which is the crop, in which they stow away the food which %0a%3c %0a%3c ^ "With Sardonic laughter, as Hardouin remarks. %0a%3c %0a%3c «' Or small guts.

The other birds %0a%3c are in general destitute of crop, but then they have a more ca- %0a%3c pacious gorge, the jackdaw, the raven, and the crow, for in- %0a%3c stance : some, again, are constituted in neither manner, but %0a%3c have the belly close to the gorge, those, for instance, which %0a%3c have the neck very long and narrow, such as the porphyrio.*' %0a%3c In the solid-hoofed animals the belly is rough and hard, %0a%3c while in some laud animals it is provided with rough asperi- %0a%3c ties like teeth,^ and in others, again, it has a reticulated sur- %0a%3c face like that of a file. Those animals which have not the %0a%3c teeth on both sides, and do not ruminate, digest the food in %0a%3c the belly, from whence it descends to the lower intestines. %0a%3c There is an organ in all animals attached in the middle to %0a%3c the navel, and in man similar in its lower part to that of the %0a%3c swine, the name given thereto by the Greeks being " colon," %0a%3c a part of the body which is subject to excruciating pains." %0a%3c In dogs this gut is extremely contracted, for which reason it is %0a%3c that they are unable to ease it, except by great efforts, and not %0a%3c without considerable suffering. Those animals with which the %0a%3c food passes at once from the belly through the straight intestine, %0a%3c are of insatiate appetite, as, for instance, the hind-wolf,^ and %0a%3c among birds the diver. The elephant has fonr^^ bellies ; the %0a%3c rest of its intestines are similar to those of the swine, and %0a%3c the lungs are four times as large as those of the ox.

To %0a%3c this membrane is attached the spleen, which lies on the left %0a%3c side, and opposite the liver : sometimes, indeed, it changes %0a%3c place with the liver, but such a case is looked upon as nothing %0a%3c less than a prodigy. Some persons imagine that a spleen of %0a%3c extremely diminutive size exists in the oviparous animals, %0a%3c as also in serpents ; at all events, it is to be detected in the %0a%3c tortoise, the crocodile, the lizard, and the frog ; though it %0a%3c is equally certain that it does not exist in the bird known as %0a%3c the " aegocephalos," nor yet in those animals which are des- %0a%3c titute of blood. The spleen sometimes offers a peculiar impe- %0a%3c diment in running, for which reason the region of the spleen %0a%3c is cauterized'" in runners who are troubled with pains there. %0a%3c It is said also, that if the spleen is removed'^ by an incision, %0a%3c animals may survive. There are some persons who think %0a%3c that with the spleen man loses the power of laughing, and %0a%3c that excessive laughter is caused by the overgrowth of it. %0a%3c There is a territory of Asia, known as Scepsis,'* in which it is %0a%3c said that the spleen of the cattle is remarkably small, and %0a%3c that from thence it is that remedies for diseases of the spleen %0a%3c have been introduced. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 81. — THE KIDNETS : ANIMALS WHICH HAVE FOUR KID- %0a%3c NEYS.

Indeed, there is no animal that %0a%3c has any bones around the belly. Man is the only creature %0a%3c that has a broad breast ; in all others it is of a carinated %0a%3c shape, in birds more particularly, and most of all, the aquatic %0a%3c birds.

In the bladder of %0a%3c the wolf there is found a small stone, which is called " syrites ;" %0a%3c and in the bladders of some persons calculi are sometimes %0a%3c found, which produce most excruciating pains ; small hairs, %0a%3c like bristles, are also occasionally found in the bladder. This %0a%3c organ consists of a membrane, which, when once wounded, does %0a%3c not' cicatrize, just like those in which the brain and the heart %0a%3c are enveloped : there are many kinds of membranes, in fact. %0a%3c I This is a mistake.

Another name for this partis %0a%3c " loci but in other .animals it is known by the name of %0a%3c "vulva." AVith the viper and other animals which generate %0a%3c their young within themselves, the womb is double ; while %0a%3c with those which are oviparous, it is attached to the diaphragm. %0a%3c In woman it has two concavities, one on either side : when %0a%3c the matrix becomes displaced, it is productive of fatal effects, by %0a%3c causing suffocation.'' It is asserted that the cow, when preg- %0a%3c nant, carries her young only in the right concavity of the womb, %0a%3c and that this is the case even when she produces twins. The %0a%3c womb of the sow is considered better eating if she has slipped her %0a%3c young, than if she has duly brought forth : in the former case %0a%3c it is known by the name of " ejectitia," in the latter it is %0a%3c called " porcaria." The womb of a sow that has farrowed only %0a%3c once is the most esteemed, and that of those which have %0a%3c ceased farrowing, the least. After farrowing, unless the ani- %0a%3c mal is killed the same day, the womb is of a livid colour, and %0a%3c lean. This part, however, is not esteemed in a young sow, %0a%3c except just after the fii'st farrowing : indeed, it is much more %0a%3c highly valued in an animal of a more mature age, so long as it %0a%3c is not past breeding, or has been killed two days before far- %0a%3c rowing, or two days after, or upon the day on which it has %0a%3c miscarried. The next best after that of a sow that has mis- %0a%3c caiTied, is that of one that has been killed the day after far- %0a%3c rowing : indeed, the paps of this last, if the young have not %0a%3c begun to suck, are excellent eating, while those of an animal %0a%3c that has miscarried are very inferior. The ancients called this %0a%3c part by the name of " abdomen," before it grew hard, and %0a%3c were not in the habit of killing swine while in a state of %0a%3c pregnancy. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 85.

This fat becomes hard, and when quite %0a%3c cold turns brittle, and is always found at the extremity of the %0a%3c flesh ; while, on the other hand, the fat which lies between the %0a%3c skin and the flesh forms a kind of liquid juice. Some animals %0a%3c naturally do not become fat, such as the hare and the par- %0a%3c tridge, for instance. All fat animals, male as well as female, %0a%3c are mostly barren ; and those which are remarkably fat become %0a%3c old the soonest. All animals have a certain degree of fatness %0a%3c in the eyes. The fat in all animals is devoid of sensation, %0a%3c having neither arteries nor veins. With the greater part of %0a%3c animals, fatness is productive of insensibility ; so much so, %0a%3c indeed, that it has been said, that living swine have been %0a%3c gnawed even by mice. ® It has been even asserted that the fat %0a%3c was drawn off from the body of a son of L.

It is only found in those bones which are hollow, and %0a%3c not in the tibiae of horses or dogs ; for which reason it is, that %0a%3c when the tibia is broken, the bone will not reunite, a process %0a%3c which is effected ^ by the flow of the marrow. The marrow is %0a%3c of a greasy nature in those animals which have fat, and suetty %0a%3c in those with horns. It is full of nerves, and is found only in %0a%3c the vertebral column' in those animals which have no bones, %0a%3c fishes, for instance. The bear has no marrow ; and the %0a%3c lion has a little only in some few bones of the thighs and %0a%3c the brachia, which are of such extraordinary hardness that %0a%3c sparks may be emitted therefrom, as though from a flint-stone. %0a%3c %0a%3c ' Varro, De Re Eust.

Among aquatic animals, the mollusks %0a%3c have no bones, but the body is surrounded with circles of %0a%3c flesh, as in the ssepia and the cuttle-fish, for instance ; insects, %0a%3c also, are said to be equally destitute of bones. Among aquatic %0a%3c animals, those which are cartilaginous have marrow in the %0a%3c vertebral column ; the sea-calf has cartilages, and no bones. %0a%3c The ears also, and the nostrils in all animals, when remarkably %0a%3c prominent, are made flexible by a remarkable provision of %0a%3c Nature, in order that they may not be broken. When cartilage %0a%3c is once broken, it will not unite ; nor will bone, when cut, grow %0a%3c again, except in beasts of burden, between the hoof and the %0a%3c pastern. %0a%3c %0a%3c Man increases in height till his twenty-first year, after %0a%3c which he fills out ; bul^ it is more particularly when he first %0a%3c arrives at the age of puberty that he seems to have untied a %0a%3c sort of knot in his existence, and this especially when he has %0a%3c been overtaken by illness. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 88. — THE NEEVE : ANIMALS WHICH HAVE NONE. %0a%3c %0a%3c The nerves ^ take their rise at the heart, and even surround %0a%3c it in the ox ; they have the same nature and principle as the %0a%3c marrow.

There is great vitality, too, %0a%3c in the blood, and when it is discharged from the body, it %0a%3c carries the life with it : it is not sensible, however, of touch. %0a%3c Those animals in which the blood is the thickest are the most %0a%3c courageous, and those in which it is the thinnest the most %0a%3c intelligent; while those, again, which have little or no blood are %0a%3c the most timorous of all. The blood of the bull coagulates and %0a%3c hardens the most sjjeedily of all, and hence it is so particu- %0a%3c larly deadly when drunk.

It is a well-known fact, that when a man is in fear, %0a%3c the blood takes to flight and disappears, and that many per- %0a%3c sons have been pierced through the body without losing one %0a%3c drop of blood ; a thing, however, which is only the case with %0a%3c man.

THE HAIR AND THE COVERING OF THE SKIN. %0a%3c %0a%3c Those animals which are viviparous, have hair ; those which %0a%3c are oviparous, have feathers, scales, or a shell, like the tor- %0a%3c toise ; or else a purple skin, like the serpent. The lower part %0a%3c of all feathers is hollow : if cut, they will not grow again, but if %0a%3c pulled out, they will shoot afresh. Insects fly by the aid of a %0a%3c frail membrane ; the wings of the fish'" called the "swallow" are %0a%3c moistened in the sea, while those of the bat which frequents %0a%3c our houses are dry ; the wings of this last animal have certain %0a%3c articulations as well. The hairs that issue from a thick skin %0a%3c are rough, while those on females are of a finer quality. Those %0a%3c found on the horse's mane are more abundant, which is the %0a%3c case also with the shoulders of the lion. The dasypus has %0a%3c hair in the inside of the mouth even and under the feet, two %0a%3c features Avhich Trogus has also attributed to the hare ; from %0a%3c Avhich the same author concludes that hairy men are the most %0a%3c prone to lust. The most hairy of all animals is the hare. %0a%3c Man is the only creature that has hair as the mark of puberty ; %0a%3c and a person who is devoid of this, whether male or female, %0a%3c is sure to be sterile. The hair of man is partly born with %0a%3c him, and in part produced after his birth. The last kind of hair %0a%3c will not grow upon eunuchs, though that which has been born %0a%3c with thera does not fall ofl"; Avhich is the case also with %0a%3c women, in a great degree. Still however, there have been %0a%3c women known to be afflicted Avith falling off' of the hair, just %0a%3c as some are to be seen with a fine down on the face, after the %0a%3c cessation of the menstrual discharge. In some men the hair %0a%3c that mostly shoots forth after birth will not grow spontane- %0a%3c ously.

In quadrupeds, the hair %0a%3c grows thicker in old age ; but on those with wool, it becomes %0a%3c thinner. Those quadrupeds which have thick hair on the %0a%3c back, have the belly quite smooth. From the hides of oxen, %0a%3c and that of the bull more especially, glue is extracted by %0a%3c boiling. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 95. THE PAPS : BIRDS THAT HAVE PAPS. EEMABKABLK %0a%3c %0a%3c FACTS CONNECTED WITH THE DUGS OF ANIMALS. %0a%3c %0a%3c Man is the only male among animals that has nipples, all %0a%3c the rest having mere marks only in place of them. Among %0a%3c female animals even, the only ones that have mammae on the %0a%3c breast are those which can nurture their young, l^o oviparous %0a%3c animal has mammae, and those only have milk that are vivi- %0a%3c parous ; the bat being the only winged animal that has it. As %0a%3c for the stories that they tell, about the screech-owl ejecting milk %0a%3c from its teats upon the lips of infants, I look upon it as utterly %0a%3c fabulous : from ancient times the name " strix,"^° I am aware, %0a%3c has been employed in maledictions, but I do not think it is %0a%3c well ascertained what bird is really meant by that name. %0a%3c %0a%3c (40.) The female ass is troubled with pains in the teats %0a%3c after it has foaled, and it is for that reason that at the end of %0a%3c six months it weans its young ; while the mare suckles its %0a%3c young for nearly the whole year. The solid-hoofed animals %0a%3c do not bear more than two young ones at a time : they all of %0a%3c them have two paps, and nowhere but between the iiind legs. %0a%3c Animals with cloven feet and with horns, such as the cow, for %0a%3c instance, have four paps, similarly situate, sheep and goats two. %0a%3c %0a%3c 20 It is not improbable that, under this name, some kind of large vam- %0a%3c pire bat was meant ; but, as Pliny says, it is impossible to arrive at any %0a%3c certain knowledge on the subject. 'I'he best account given of the strix is %0a%3c that in Ovid's Fasti, B. vi. The name was given opprobiously to supposed %0a%3c witches, the "foul and midnight hags" of Shakspeare. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 96.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c THE MILK. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 83 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Th ose which, produce a more nunierous progeny, and those %0a%3c which have toes on the feet, have a greater number of paps dis- %0a%3c tributed in a double row all along the belly, such as the %0a%3c sow, for instance ; the better sorts have twelve, the more %0a%3c common ones two less : the same is the case also with tlie %0a%3c female of the dog. Other animals, again, have four paps situate %0a%3c in the middle of the belly, as the female panther; others, again, %0a%3c two only, as the lioness. The female elephant has two only, %0a%3c situate between the shoulders, and those not in the breast, but %0a%3c without it, and hidden in the arm-pits : none of the animals %0a%3c which have toes have the paps between the hind legs. The sow %0a%3c presents the first teat to the first-born in each farrow, the first %0a%3c teat being the one that is situate nearest to the throat. Each %0a%3c pig, too, knows its own teat, according to the order in which %0a%3c it was born, and drawls its nourishment from that and no other : %0a%3c if its own suckling, too, should happen to be withdrawn from %0a%3c any one of them, the pap will immediately dry up, and shrink %0a%3c back within the belly : if there should be only one pig left %0a%3c of all the farrow, that pap alone which has been assigned for %0a%3c its nutriment Avhen born, will continue to hang down for the %0a%3c purpose of giving suck. The she-bear has four mammte, the %0a%3c dolphin only two, at the bottom of the belly ; they are not %0a%3c easily visible, and have a somewhat oblique direction : this is %0a%3c the only animal which gives suck while in motion. The baleena %0a%3c and sea-calf also suckle their young by teats. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 96. (41.) — THE MILK : THE BIKSTINGS. CHEESE ; OF WHAT %0a%3c MILK CHEESE CANNOT BE MADE. UENNET ; THE VAKXOUS KINDS %0a%3c OF ALIMENT IN MILK. %0a%3c %0a%3c The milk that is secreted in a woman before her seventh %0a%3c month is useless ; but after that month, so long as the foetus %0a%3c is healthy, the milk is wholesome : many women, indeed, %0a%3c are so full of milk, that it will flow not only from the mammfe, %0a%3c but exudes at the arm-pits even.^^ Camels continue in milk %0a%3c until they are pregnant again. Their milk, mixed in the pro- %0a%3c portion of one part to three of water, is considered a very %0a%3c pleasant beverage.

She-asses, as %0a%3c soon as they are pregnant, have milk in their udders ; when %0a%3c the pastm-age is rich, it is fatal to their young to taste the %0a%3c mother's milk the first two days after birth ; the kind of %0a%3c malady by which they are attacked is known by the name %0a%3c of " colostration." Cheese cannot be made from the milk of %0a%3c animals which have teeth on either jaw, from the circumstance %0a%3c that their milk does not coagulate. The thinnest milk of all %0a%3c is that of the camel, and next to it that of the mare. The milk %0a%3c of the she-ass is the richest of all, so much so, indeed, that it is %0a%3c often used instead of rennet. Asses' milk is also thought to %0a%3c be very efficacious in whitening the skin of females : at all %0a%3c events, Poppaea,^^ the wife of Domitius Nero, used always to %0a%3c have with her five hundred asses with foal, and used to bathe %0a%3c the whole of her body in their milk, thinking that it also con- %0a%3c ferred additional suppleness on the skin. All milk thickens %0a%3c by the action of fire, and becomes serous when exposed to cold. %0a%3c The milk of the cow produces more cheese than that of the %0a%3c goat : when equal in quantity, it will produce nearly twice the %0a%3c weight. The milk of animals which have more than four %0a%3c mammte does not produce cheese ; and that is the best which is %0a%3c made of the milk of those that have but two. The rennet of %0a%3c the fawn, the hare, and the kid is the most esteemed, but the %0a%3c best of all is that of the dasypus : this last acts as a specific %0a%3c for diarrhoea, that animal being the only one with teeth in %0a%3c both jaws, the rennet of which has that property. It is a re- %0a%3c markable circumstance, that the barbarous nations which sub- %0a%3c sist on milk have been for so many ages either ignorant of the %0a%3c merits of cheese, or else have totallj- disregarded it ; and yet %0a%3c the)'" understand how to thicken milk and form therefrom an %0a%3c acrid kind of liquid with a pleasant flavour, as well as a rich %0a%3c butter : this last is the foam-* of milk, and is of a thicker con- %0a%3c sistency than the part which is known as the " serum." We %0a%3c ought not to omit that butter has certain of the properties of %0a%3c oil, and that it is used for an ointment among all barbarous %0a%3c nations, and among ourselves as well, for infants. %0a%3c %0a%3c ^ S*ee B. xxyiii. c. 12.

The pastures of the Alps %0a%3c recommend themselves by two sorts of cheese ; the Dalmatic %0a%3c Alps send us the Docleatian-* cheese, and the Centronian-* %0a%3c Alps the Vatusican. The kinds produced in the Apennines are %0a%3c more numerous ; from Liguria we have the cheese of Ceba,-* %0a%3c which is mostly made from the milk of sheep ; from Umbria %0a%3c we have that of iEsina, and from the frontiers of Etruria and %0a%3c Liguria those of Luna, remarkable for their vast size, a single %0a%3c cheese weighing as much as a thousand pounds. Nearer the %0a%3c City, again, we have the cheese of Vestinum, the best of this %0a%3c kind being that which comes from the territory of Cedi- %0a%3c tium.^' Goats also pi'oduce a cheese which has been of late %0a%3c held in the highest esteem, its flavour being heightened by %0a%3c smoking it. The cheese of this kind which is made at Rome %0a%3c is considered preferable to any other ; for that which is made %0a%3c in Gaul has a strong taste, like that of medicine. Of the %0a%3c cheeses that are made beyond sea, that of Bithynia^^ is usually %0a%3c considered the fii'st in quality. That salt exists in pasture- %0a%3c lands is pretty evident, from the fact that all cheese as it %0a%3c grows old contracts a saltish flavour, even where it does not %0a%3c appear to any great extent while at the same time it is %0a%3c equally well known that cheese soaked in a mixture of thyme %0a%3c and vinegar will regain its original fresh flavour.

THE FINGEES, THE AEMS. %0a%3c %0a%3c Some persons have six fingers on the hands. "We read that %0a%3c C. Horatius, a man of patrician rank, had two daughters, who %0a%3c for this reason had the name of " Sedigitaj and we find %0a%3c mention made of Volcatius Sedigitus,^* as a famous poet. %0a%3c The fingers of man have three joints, the thumb only two, %0a%3c it bending in an opposite direction to all the other fingers. %0a%3c Viewed by itself, the movement of the thumb has a sidelong %0a%3c direction, and it is much thicker than the rest of the fingers. %0a%3c The little finger is equal in length to the thumb, and two others %0a%3c are also equal in length, the middle finger being the longest %0a%3c of all. Those quadrupeds which live by rapine have five toes %0a%3c on the fore feet, and four on the hinder ones. The lion, the %0a%3c wolf, and the dog, with some few others, have five claws %0a%3c on the hind feet, one of which hangs down near the joint of the %0a%3c leg. The other animals, also, which are of smaller size, have %0a%3c five toes. The two arms are not always equal in length : it %0a%3c is a well-known fact, that, in the school of gladiators belong- %0a%3c ing to Caius Cassar,^* the Thracian Studiosus had the right %0a%3c arm longer than the left.

They have a thumb also, and %0a%3c articulations similar to those in man. The males differ from %0a%3c man in the sexual parts only, while all the internal viscera %0a%3c exactly resemble those of man. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 101. (45.) THE NAILS. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is generally supposed that the nails are the terminations %0a%3c of the sinews. All animals whicli have fingers luive nails us %0a%3c well. In the ape they are long and overlapping,^'* like a tile, %0a%3c while in man they are broad : they will grow even after death. %0a%3c In the beasts of prey they are hooked, Avhile in others, such %0a%3c as the dog, for instance, they are straight, with the exception, %0a%3c indeed, of the one which is attached to the leg in most of %0a%3c them. All the animals which have feet [and not hoots], have; %0a%3c toes as well, except the elephant ; he, also, wouhl appear to %0a%3c have toes, five in number, but rudely developed, undivided, %0a%3c and hardly distinct from one another, bearing a nearer resem- %0a%3c blance, in fact, to hoofs than to claws. In the elephant the %0a%3c fore-feet are the largest, and in the hind-feet there are sliort %0a%3c joints. This animal is able, also, to bend the hams inward %0a%3c like a man, while in all the others the joints of the hinder %0a%3c legs bend in a contrary direction to those of the fore ones. %0a%3c Those animals which are viviparous bend the fore-leg forward, %0a%3c while the joint of the hind-leg is directed backward, %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 102.^ — THE KNEE^ AND THE HAMS. %0a%3c %0a%3c In man the knee and the elbow bend contrary ways ; tho %0a%3c same is the case, too, with the bear and the ape, and it is for %0a%3c this reason that they are not so swift of foot as other ani- %0a%3c mals.

PARTS OF TnK HtniAN BODY TO WUICri CEItTAIX %0a%3c %0a%3c KELIGIOUS IDEAS ARE ATTACHED. %0a%3c %0a%3c In accordance with the usages of various nations, certain %0a%3c religious ideas have been attached to the knees. It is thu %0a%3c knees that suppliants clasp, and it is to these that they extend %0a%3c their hands ; it is the knees that they worship like so many %0a%3c altars, as it were ; perhaps, because in them is centred the %0a%3c vital strength. For in the joint of eitlier knee, the right %0a%3c as well as the left, there is on the fore-side of each a certain %0a%3c empty space, which bears a strong resemblance to a mouth, and %0a%3c through which, like the throat, if it is once pierced, the vital %0a%3c powers escape.^'' There are also certain religious ideas at- %0a%3c tached to other parts of che body, as is testified in raising tlie %0a%3c hack of the right hand to the lips, and extending it as a token %0a%3c of good faith. It was the custom of the ancient Greeks, when %0a%3c in the act of supplication, to touch the chin. The seat of the %0a%3c memorj' lies in the lower part of the ear, which we touch %0a%3c when we summon a witness to depose upon memory to an %0a%3c arrest.''® The seat, too, of Xemesis^" lies behind the right ear, a %0a%3c goddess which has never yet found a Latin name, no, not in tlio %0a%3c Capitol even. It is to this part that we apply the finger next %0a%3c the little finger, after touching the mouth with it, Avhen we %0a%3c silently ask pardon of the gods for having let slip an indiscreet %0a%3c word. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 104.

THE GAIT, THE FEET, THE LEGS. %0a%3c %0a%3c All animals take a right-hand direction when they first %0a%3c begin to walk, and lie down on the left side. While the other %0a%3c animals walk just as it may happen, the lion only and the %0a%3c camel walk foot by foot, or in such a way that the left foot %0a%3c never passes the right, but always comes behind it. Men have %0a%3c the largest feet ; in every kind of animal the female has the %0a%3c smallest. Man only" has calves, and flesh upon the legs : we %0a%3c find it stated by authors, however, that there was once an %0a%3c Egyptian who had no calves on his legs. All men, too, with %0a%3c some few exceptions, have a sole to the foot. It is from these %0a%3c exceptional cases that persons have obtained the names of %0a%3c Plancus,'" Plautus, Punsa, and Scaurus ; just as, from the mal- %0a%3c formation of the legs, we find persons called Varus,^^ Vacia, and %0a%3c Vatinius, all which blemishes are to be seen in quadrupeds %0a%3c also. Animals which have no horns have a solid hoof, from %0a%3c which circumstance it is used by them as a weapon of off'ence, %0a%3c in place of horns ; such animals as these are also des- %0a%3c titute of pastern bones, but those which have cloven hoofs %0a%3c have them ; w'hile those, again, which have toes have none, %0a%3c nor are they ever found iu the fore-feet of animals. The %0a%3c camel has pastern bones like those of the ox, but somewhat %0a%3c smaller, the feet being cloven, with a slight line of division, %0a%3c and having a fleshy sole, like that of the bear : hence it is, %0a%3c that in a long journey, the animal becomes fatigued, and the %0a%3c foot cracks, if it is not shod. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. lOG, (46.)

As to %0a%3c swine, they are looked upon as a sort of mongrel race, with a %0a%3c mixture of both kinds, and hence it is that their ankle-bones %0a%3c are so misshapen. Those authors who have imagined that %0a%3c man has similar pastern-bones, are easily to be confuted. The %0a%3c Ij-nx is the only one among the animals that have the feet %0a%3c divided into toes, that has anything bearing a resemblance %0a%3c to a pastern-bone ; while with the lion it is more crooked %0a%3c still. The great pastern-bone is straight, and situate in the %0a%3c joints of the foot; it projects outwards in a convex protube- %0a%3c rance, and is held fast in its vertebration by certain liga- %0a%3c ments. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 107. (47.) THE FEET OF BIEDS. %0a%3c %0a%3c Among birds, some have the feet divided into toes, while %0a%3c others, again, are broad and flatfooted — in others, which par- %0a%3c take of the intermediate nature of both, the toes are divided, %0a%3c with a wide space between them. All birds, however, have %0a%3c four toes — three in front, and one on the heel ; this last, how- %0a%3c ever, is wanting in some that have long legs. The iynx*' is %0a%3c the only bird that has two toes on each side of the leg. This %0a%3c bird also protrudes a long tongue similar to that of the serpent, %0a%3c and it can turn the neck quite round and look backwards ; if %0a%3c has great talons, too, like those of the jackdaw. Some of the %0a%3c heavier birds have spurs also upon the legs; but none of %0a%3c those have them which have crooked talons as well. The %0a%3c long-footed birds, as they fly, extend the legs towards the tail, %0a%3c while those that have short legs hold them contracted close to %0a%3c the middle of the body. Those authors who deny that there %0a%3c is any bird without feet, assert that those even which are %0a%3c called apodes,^* are not without them, as also the oce, and the %0a%3c drepanis,** which last is a bird but very rarely seen.

(48.) THE FEET OF ANIMALS, FROM TTirSE HATING %0a%3c %0a%3c TWO FEET TO THOSE WITH A HUNDUED. DWAHFi. %0a%3c %0a%3c Among insects, those which have hard eyes have the fore- %0a%3c feet long, in order that from time to time they may rub the %0a%3c eyes with their feet, as we frequently see done by flies. The %0a%3c insects which have long hind-feet are able to leap, the locust, %0a%3c for instance. All these insects have six feet : and some of the %0a%3c spiders have two very long feet in addition. They have, all %0a%3c of them, three joints. We have already" stated that marine %0a%3c insects have eight feet, such as the polypus, the ssepia, the %0a%3c cuttle-fish, and the crab, animals which move their arms in a %0a%3c contrary direction to their feet, which last they move around %0a%3c as well as obliquely : they are the only animals the feet of %0a%3c which have a rounded form. Other insects have two feet to %0a%3c regulate their movements ; in the crab, and in that only, these %0a%3c duties are performed by four. The land animals which exceed %0a%3c this number of feet, as most of the worms,*® never have fewer %0a%3c than twelve feet, and some, indeed, as many as a hundred. %0a%3c The number of feet is never uneven in any animal. Among %0a%3c the solid-hoofed animals, the legs are of their proper length %0a%3c from the moment of their birth, after which they may with %0a%3c more propriety be said to extend themselves than to increase %0a%3c in growth : hence it is, that in infancy they are able to scratch %0a%3c their ears with the hind feet, a thing which, when they grow %0a%3c older, they are not able to do, because their increase of growth %0a%3c affects only the superficies of the body. It is for the same %0a%3c reason also, that they are only able to graze at first by bending %0a%3c the knees, until such time as the neck has attained its proper %0a%3c length. %0a%3c %0a%3c (49.) There are dwarfs to be found among all animals, and %0a%3c among birds even. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 109. THE SEXTTAL PARTS.

Among %0a%3c the peoples of the East the very best bow-strings are those %0a%3c which are made of the member of the camel. These parts also, %0a%3c among different nations, are made the object of certain usages'" %0a%3c and religious observances ; and the Galli/^ the priests of the %0a%3c Mother of the gods, are in the habit of castrating themselves, %0a%3c without any dangerous results. On the other hand, there is %0a%3c in some few w^omen a monstrous resemblance to the male con- %0a%3c formation, while hermaphrodites appear to partake of the %0a%3c nature of both. Instances of this last conformation were %0a%3c seen in quadrupeds in Nero's reign, and for the first time, I %0a%3c imagine ; for he ostentatiously paraded hermaphrodite horses %0a%3c yoked to his car, which had been found in the territory of %0a%3c the Treviri, in Gaul ; as if, indeed, it was so remarkably fine a %0a%3c sight to behold the ruler of the earth seated in a chariot dra^^-n %0a%3c by monstrosities ! %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 110. — rnE TESTES — THE THKEE CLASSES OP EUNUCHS. %0a%3c %0a%3c In sheep and cattle the testes hang down to the legs, while %0a%3c in the boar they are knit up close to the body. In the dolphin %0a%3c they are very long, and are concealed in the lower part of the %0a%3c belly. In the elephant, also, they are quite concealed. In %0a%3c oviparous animals they adhere to the interior of the loins: %0a%3c these animals are the most speedy in the venereal congress. %0a%3c Fishes and serpents have no testes, but in place of them they %0a%3c have two-veins, which run from the renal region to the genitals. %0a%3c The bird known as the " buteo,"*^ has three testes. Man is %0a%3c the only creature in which the testes are ever broken, either %0a%3c accidentally or by some natural malady ; those -who are thus %0a%3c afflicted form a third class of half men, in addition to her- %0a%3c maphrodites and eunuchs. In all species of animals the male %0a%3c is more courageous than the female, with the exception of the %0a%3c panther and the bear. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 111. (50.)

In animals with bristles %0a%3c the tail is bare, as in the boar, for instance. In those that are %0a%3c shaggy, it is small, such as the bear ; while in those animals %0a%3c that have long hair, the tail is long also, the horse, for in- %0a%3c stance. The tail of a lizard or serpent, if cut off, wall grow %0a%3c again. The tail governs the movements of the fish like a %0a%3c rudder, and turning from side to side, to the right or to the %0a%3c left, impels it onwards, acting in some degree like an oar. %0a%3c A double tail is sometimes found in lizards. In oxen, the %0a%3c stalk of the tail is of remarkable length, and is covered with %0a%3c rough hair at the extremitj-. In the ass, too, it is longer than %0a%3c in the horse, but in beasts of burden it is covered with bristly %0a%3c hairs. The tail of the lion, at the extremity, is like that of %0a%3c the ox and the field-mouse ; but this is not the case with the %0a%3c panther. In the fox and the wolf it is covered with long %0a%3c luiir, as in sheep, in w^hich it is longer also. In swine, the %0a%3c tail is curled ; among dogs, those that are mongrels carry it %0a%3c close beneath the belly. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 112. (51.) — THE DIFFERENT VOICES OF ANIMALS. %0a%3c %0a%3c Aristotle^- is of opinion that no animal has a voice which %0a%3c does not respire, and that hence it is that there is no voice in %0a%3c insects, but only a noise, through the circulation of the air in %0a%3c the interior, and its resounding, by reason of its compression. %0a%3c 8ome insects, again, he says, emit a sort of humming noise, %0a%3c such as the bee, for instance ; others a shrill, long-drawn note, %0a%3c like the grasshopper, the two cavities beneath the thorax re- %0a%3c ceiving the air, which, meeting a moveable membrane within, %0a%3c emits a sound by the attrition. — Also that flies, bees, and %0a%3c other insects of that nature, are only heard while they are %0a%3c flying, and cease to be heard the moment they settle, and that %0a%3c the sound which they emit proceeds from the friction and the %0a%3c air within them, and not from any act of respiration. At all %0a%3c events, it is generally believed that the locust emits a sound %0a%3c by rubbing together the wdngs and thighs, and that among %0a%3c the aquatic animals the scallop makes a certain noise as it %0a%3c flies.** Mollusks, however, and the testaceous animals have no %0a%3c voice and emit no sounds. As for the other fishes, although %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c " Hist. Anim.

The tish, too, that %0a%3c is found in the river Acheloiis, and is known as the boar-fish," %0a%3c makes a grunting noise, as do some others which we have pre- %0a%3c viously** mentioned. The oviparous animals hiss: in the %0a%3c serpent this hissing is prolonged, in the tortoise it is short and %0a%3c abrupt. Frogs make a peculiar noise of their own, as already %0a%3c stated;^ unless, indeed, this, too, is to be looked upon as a %0a%3c matter of doubt ; but their noise originates in the mouth, and %0a%3c not in the thorax. Still, however, in reference to this subject, %0a%3c the nature of the various localities exercises a very considerable %0a%3c influence, for in Macedonia, it is said, the frogs are dumb, and %0a%3c the same in reference to the wild boars there. Among birds, %0a%3c the smaller ones chirp and twitter the most, and more espe- %0a%3c cially about the time of pairing. Others, again, exercise their %0a%3c voice while figliting, the quail, for instance ; others before %0a%3c they begin to fight, such as the partridge ; and others M'hen %0a%3c they have gained the victory, the dunghill cock, for instance, %0a%3c The males in these species have a peculiar note of their own, %0a%3c while in others, the nightingale for example, the male has %0a%3c the same note as the female. %0a%3c %0a%3c Some birds sing all the year round, others only at certain %0a%3c times of the year, as we have already mentioned when speak- %0a%3c ing of them individually. The elephant produces a noise %0a%3c similar to that of sneezing, by the aid of the mouth, and in- %0a%3c dependently of the nostrils ; but by means of the nostrils it %0a%3c emits a sound similar to the hoarse braying of a trumpet %0a%3c It is only in the bovine race that the voice of the female is the %0a%3c deepest, it being in all other kinds of animals more shrill than %0a%3c that of the male ; it is the same also with the male of the %0a%3c human race when castrated. The infant at its birth is never %0a%3c heard to utter a cry before it has entirely left the uterus: %0a%3c it begins to speak at the end of the first year. A son of %0a%3c Croesus," however, spoke when only six months old, and, while %0a%3c yet wielding the child's rattle, afforded portentous omens, for %0a%3c %0a%3c 5* "Aper." 65 B. ix. c. 7. %0a%3c %0a%3c 6s See c. 65 of the present Book. %0a%3c %0a%3c *' Not the diimh son mentioned by Herodotus, who saved his father's %0a%3c life at the taking of Sardes. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 113.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c SUPEKFI.UOUS LIMBS. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 95 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c it was at the same period that his father's empire fell.

The human voice acquires additional strength at the %0a%3c fourteenth year ; but in old age it becomes more shrill again, %0a%3c and there is no living creature in which it is subject to more %0a%3c frequent changes. %0a%3c %0a%3c In addition to the preceding, there are still some singular %0a%3c circumstances that deserve to be mentioned with reference to %0a%3c the voice. If saw-dust or sand is thrown down in the orches- %0a%3c tra of a theatre, or if the walls around are left in a rough %0a%3c state, or empty casks are placed there, the voice is absorbed ; %0a%3c while, on the other hand, if the wall is quite straight, or if %0a%3c built in a concave fonn, tlie voice will move along it, and will %0a%3c convey words spoken in the slightest whisper from one %0a%3c end*^ to the other, if there is no inequality in the surface to %0a%3c impede its progress. The voice, in man, contributes in a great %0a%3c degree to form his physiognomy, for we form a knowledge of %0a%3c a man before we see him by hearing his voice, just as well^ %0a%3c as if we had seen him with our eyes. There are as many %0a%3c kinds of voices, too, as there are individuals in existence, and %0a%3c each man has his own peculiar voice, just as much as his own %0a%3c peculiar physiognomy. Hence it is, that arises that vast di- %0a%3c versity of nations and languages throughout the whole earth : %0a%3c in this, too, originate the many tunes, measures, and inflexions %0a%3c that exist. But, before all other things, it is the voice that %0a%3c serves to express our sentiments,'^" a power that distinguishes %0a%3c us from the beasts ; just as, in the same way, the various shades %0a%3c and differences in language that exist among men have created %0a%3c an equally marked difference between us and the brutes. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 113.

Al- %0a%3c though I am quite convinced of the utter futility of these re- %0a%3c marks, and am of opinion that they ouglit not to he published %0a%3c -without hesitation, for fear lest each person might be anxiouslj' %0a%3c looking out for these prognostics in his own person, I shall still %0a%3c make some slight mention of the subject, seeing that so learned %0a%3c a man as Aristotle did not treat it with contempt. He has set %0a%3c down the following as indications of a short life — few teeth, %0a%3c very long fingers, a leaden colour, and numerous broken lines %0a%3c in the palm of the hand. On the other hand, he looks upon the %0a%3c following as prognostics of a long life — stooping in the shoul- %0a%3c ders, one or two long unbroken lines in the hand, a greater num- %0a%3c ber than two-and-thirtj' teeth, and large ears . He does not, I %0a%3c imagine, require that all these sj^mptoms should unite in one %0a%3c person, but looks upon them as individuallj^ significant : in my %0a%3c opinion, however, they are utterlj^ frivolous, all of them, al- %0a%3c though they obtain currency among the vulgar. Our own writer, %0a%3c Trogus, has in a similar manner set down the physiognomy as %0a%3c indicative of the moral disposition ; one of the very gravest of %0a%3c the Roman authors, whose own*" words I will here subjoin:— %0a%3c %0a%3c " Where the forehead is broad, it is significant of a dull and %0a%3c sluggish understanding beneath ; and where it is small, it in- %0a%3c dicates an unsteady disposition. A rounded forehead denotes %0a%3c an irascible temper, it seeming as though the swelling anger %0a%3c had left its traces there. Where the eye-brows are extended %0a%3c in one straight line, they denote effeminacy in ihe owner, and %0a%3c when they are bent downwards towards the nose, an austere %0a%3c disposition. On the other hand, when the eye-brows are bent %0a%3c towards the temples, they are indicative of a sarcastic dispo- %0a%3c sition ; but when they lie very low, thcj denote malice and %0a%3c envy. Long eyes are significant of a spiteful, malicious nature; %0a%3c and where the corners of the eyes next the nose are fleshy, it %0a%3c is a sign also of a wicked disposition. If the white of the eye %0a%3c is large, it bears tokens of impudence, while those who are %0a%3c incessantly closing the ej'elids are inconstant.

Thus much %0a%3c of what Trogus says. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 115, (53.) — RESPIRATION AND NUTRIMENT. %0a%3c %0a%3c The hreath of the lion is fetid, and that of the bear quite %0a%3c pestilential ; indeed, no beast will touch anything with Avhich %0a%3c its breath has come in contact, and substances which it has %0a%3c breathed upon will become putrid sooner than others. It is %0a%3c in man only that Nature has willed that the breath should %0a%3c become tainted in several ways, either through faultiness in %0a%3c the victuals or the teeth, or else, as is more generally the case, %0a%3c through extreme old age. Our breath in itself was insensible %0a%3c to all pain, utterly devoid as it was of all powers of touch and %0a%3c feeling, without which there can be no sensation ; ever re- %0a%3c newed, it was always forthcoming, destined to be the last ad- %0a%3c junct that shall leave the body, and the only one to remain %0a%3c when aU is gone beside ; it drew, in fine, its origin from, %0a%3c heaven. In spite of all this, however, certain penalties were %0a%3c discovered to be inflicted upon it, so that the very substance %0a%3c by the aid of which we live might become a torment to us in %0a%3c life. This inconvenience is more particularly experienced %0a%3c among the Partliians, from their youth upwards, on account %0a%3c of the indiscriminate use of food among them ; and, indeed, %0a%3c their very excess in wine causes their breath to be fetid. The %0a%3c grandees, however, of that nation have a remedy for bad breath %0a%3c in the pips of the Assyrian citron,^- which they mix with their %0a%3c food, and the aroma of which is particularly agreeable. The %0a%3c breath of the elephant will attract serpents from their holes, %0a%3c while that of the stag scorches them. We have already made %0a%3c mention*^ of certain races of men who could by suction extract %0a%3c from the body the venom of serpents ; and swine will even eat %0a%3c serpents,*^ which to other animals are poisonous.

ANIMALS WHICH WHEN FED UPON POISON Do %0a%3c %0a%3c NOT DIE, AND THE FLESH OF WHICH IS POISONOUS. %0a%3c %0a%3c The animals which feed upon poison have been already" %0a%3c mentioned. Some of them, which are harmless of themselves, %0a%3c become noxious if fed upon venomous substances. The wild %0a%3c boar of Pamphylia and the mountainous parts of Cilicia, after %0a%3c having devoured a salamander, will become poisonous to those %0a%3c who eat its flesh ; and yet the danger is quite imperceptible %0a%3c by reason of any peculiarity in the smell and taste. The sala- %0a%3c mander, too, will poison either water or wine, in which it %0a%3c happens to be drowned ; and what is more, if it has only drunk %0a%3c thereof, the liquid becomes poisonous. The same is the case, %0a%3c too, with the frog known to us as the bramble-frog. So nu- %0a%3c merous are the snares that are laid in wait for life ! Wasps %0a%3c greedily devour the flesh of the serpent, a nutriment which %0a%3c renders their stings fatal ; so vast is the diflerence to be found %0a%3c between one kind of food and another. In the country, too, %0a%3c of the Ichthyophagi,^' as we learn from Theophrastus, the oxen %0a%3c are fed upon fish, but only when alive. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 117. — REASONS FOR INDIGESTION. REMEDIES FOB %0a%3c CRUDITY. %0a%3c %0a%3c The most wholesome nutriment for man is plain food. An %0a%3c accumulation of flavours is injurious, and still more so, if %0a%3c heightened by sauces. All acrid elements are difiicult of di- %0a%3c gestion, and the same is the case if food is devoured greedily, %0a%3c or in too large quantities. Food is also less easily digested in %0a%3c summer than in winter, and in old age than in youth. The %0a%3c vomits which man has invented, by way of remedy for this %0a%3c evil, render the body more cold, and are more particularly inju- %0a%3c rious to the eyes and teeth. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 118.

Watching, at night more es- %0a%3c pecially, promotes digestion of the food. %0a%3c %0a%3c (54.) The size of the body is increased by eating sweet and %0a%3c fatty substances, as well as by drinking, while, on the other %0a%3c hand, it is diminished by eating dry, acrid, or cold substances, %0a%3c and by abstaining from drink. Some animals of Africa, as %0a%3c well as sheep, drink but once every four days. Abstinence %0a%3c from food for seven days, even, is not of necessity fatal to man ; %0a%3c and it is a well-known fact, that many persons have not died till %0a%3c after an abstinence of eleven days. Man is the only animal %0a%3c that is ever attacked with an insatiate^ craving for food. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 119. — WHAT THINGS,- BT MEHELY TASTING OF THEM, %0a%3c ALLAY HtJNGEE AND THIEST. %0a%3c %0a%3c On the other hand, there are some substances which, tasted %0a%3c in small quantities only, appease hunger and thirst, and keen %0a%3c up the strength, such as butter, for instance, cheese made of %0a%3c mares' milk, and liquorice.
