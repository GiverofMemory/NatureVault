according to the ordinance of the passover,%0aand according to the manner thereof, so shall he do: ye shall have one%0aordinance, both for the stranger, and for him that was born in the%0aland.%0a%0a9:15 And on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud%0acovered the tabernacle, namely, the tent of the testimony: and at even%0athere was upon the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire, until%0athe morning.%0a%0a9:16 So it was alway: the cloud covered it by day, and the appearance%0aof fire by night.%0a%0a9:17 And when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle, then after%0athat the children of Israel journeyed: and in the place where the%0acloud abode, there the children of Israel pitched their tents.%0a%0a9:18 At the commandment of the LORD the children of Israel journeyed,%0aand at the commandment of the LORD they pitched: as long as the cloud%0aabode upon the tabernacle they rested in their tents.%0a%0a9:19 And when the cloud tarried long upon the tabernacle many days,%0athen the children of Israel kept the charge of the LORD, and journeyed%0anot.%0a%0a9:20 And so it was, when the cloud was a few days upon the tabernacle;%0aaccording to the commandment of the LORD they abode in their tents,%0aand according to the commandment of the LORD they journeyed.%0a%0a9:21 And so it was, when the cloud abode from even unto the morning,%0aand that the cloud was taken up in the morning, then they journeyed:%0awhether it was by day or by night that the cloud was taken up, they%0ajourneyed.%0a%0a9:22 Or whether it were two days, or a month, or a year, that the%0acloud tarried upon the tabernacle, remaining thereon, the children of%0aIsrael abode in their tents, and journeyed not: but when it was taken%0aup, they journeyed.%0a%0a9:23 At the commandment of the LORD they rested in the tents, and at%0athe commandment of the LORD they journeyed: they kept the charge of%0athe LORD, at the commandment of the LORD by the hand of Moses.%0a%0a10:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 10:2 Make thee two%0atrumpets of silver; of a whole piece shalt thou make them: that thou%0amayest use them for the calling of the assembly, and for the%0ajourneying of the camps.%0a%0a10:3 And when they shall blow with them, all the assembly shall%0aassemble themselves to thee at the door of the tabernacle of the%0acongregation.%0a%0a10:4 And if they blow but with one trumpet, then the princes, which%0aare heads of the thousands of Israel, shall gather themselves unto%0athee.%0a%0a10:5 When ye blow an alarm, then the camps that lie on the east parts%0ashall go forward.%0a%0a10:6 When ye blow an alarm the second time, then the camps that lie on%0athe south side shall take their journey: they shall blow an alarm for%0atheir journeys.%0a%0a10:7 But when the congregation is to be gathered together, ye shall%0ablow, but ye shall not sound an alarm.%0a%0a10:8 And the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow with the trumpets;%0aand they shall be to you for an ordinance for ever throughout your%0agenerations.%0a%0a10:9 And if ye go to war in your land against the enemy that%0aoppresseth you, then ye shall blow an alarm with the trumpets; and ye%0ashall be remembered before the LORD your God, and ye shall be saved%0afrom your enemies.%0a%0a10:10 Also in the day of your gladness, and in your solemn days, and%0ain the beginnings of your months, ye shall blow with the trumpets over%0ayour burnt offerings, and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings;%0athat they may be to you for a memorial before your God: I am the LORD%0ayour God.%0a%0a10:11 And it came to pass on the twentieth day of the second month, in%0athe second year, that the cloud was taken up from off the tabernacle%0aof the testimony.%0a%0a10:12 And the children of Israel took their journeys out of the%0awilderness of Sinai; and the cloud rested in the wilderness of Paran.%0a%0a10:13 And they first took their journey according to the commandment%0aof the LORD by the hand of Moses.%0a%0a10:14 In the first place went the standard of the camp of the children%0aof Judah according to their armies: and over his host was Nahshon the%0ason of Amminadab.%0a%0a10:15 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Issachar was%0aNethaneel the son of Zuar.%0a%0a10:16 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Zebulun was%0aEliab the son of Helon.%0a%0a10:17 And the tabernacle was taken down; and the sons of Gershon and%0athe sons of Merari set forward, bearing the tabernacle.%0a%0a10:18 And the standard of the camp of Reuben set forward according to%0atheir armies: and over his host was Elizur the son of Shedeur.%0a%0a10:19 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Simeon was%0aShelumiel the son of Zurishaddai.%0a%0a10:20 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Gad was%0aEliasaph the son of Deuel.%0a%0a10:21 And the Kohathites set forward, bearing the sanctuary: and the%0aother did set up the tabernacle against they came.%0a%0a10:22 And the standard of the camp of the children of Ephraim set%0aforward according to their armies: and over his host was Elishama the%0ason of Ammihud.%0a%0a10:23 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Manasseh was%0aGamaliel the son of Pedahzur.%0a%0a10:24 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Benjamin was%0aAbidan the son of Gideoni.%0a%0a10:25 And the standard of the camp of the children of Dan set forward,%0awhich was the rereward of all the camps throughout their hosts: and%0aover his host was Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai.%0a%0a10:26 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Asher was%0aPagiel the son of Ocran.%0a%0a10:27 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Naphtali was%0aAhira the son of Enan.%0a%0a10:28 Thus were the journeyings of the children of Israel according to%0atheir armies, when they set forward.%0a%0a10:29 And Moses said unto Hobab, the son of Raguel the Midianite,%0aMoses' father in law, We are journeying unto the place of which the%0aLORD said, I will give it you: come thou with us, and we will do thee%0agood: for the LORD hath spoken good concerning Israel.%0a%0a10:30 And he said unto him, I will not go; but I will depart to mine%0aown land, and to my kindred.%0a%0a10:31 And he said, Leave us not, I pray thee; forasmuch as thou%0aknowest how we are to encamp in the wilderness, and thou mayest be to%0aus instead of eyes.%0a%0a10:32 And it shall be, if thou go with us, yea, it shall be, that what%0agoodness the LORD shall do unto us, the same will we do unto thee.%0a%0a10:33 And they departed from the mount of the LORD three days'%0ajourney: and the ark of the covenant of the LORD went before them in%0athe three days' journey, to search out a resting place for them.%0a%0a10:34 And the cloud of the LORD was upon them by day, when they went%0aout of the camp.%0a%0a10:35 And it came to pass, when the ark set forward, that Moses said,%0aRise up, LORD, and let thine enemies be scattered; and let them that%0ahate thee flee before thee.%0a%0a10:36 And when it rested, he said, Return, O LORD, unto the many%0athousands of Israel.%0a%0a11:1 And when the people complained, it displeased the LORD: and the%0aLORD heard it; and his anger was kindled; and the fire of the LORD%0aburnt among them, and consumed them that were in the uttermost parts%0aof the camp.%0a%0a11:2 And the people cried unto Moses; and when Moses prayed unto the%0aLORD, the fire was quenched.%0a%0a11:3 And he called the name of the place Taberah: because the fire of%0athe LORD burnt among them.%0a%0a11:4 And the mixt multitude that was among them fell a lusting: and%0athe children of Israel also wept again, and said, Who shall give us%0aflesh to eat?  11:5 We remember the fish, which we did eat in Egypt%0afreely; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions,%0aand the garlick: 11:6 But now our soul is dried away: there is nothing%0aat all, beside this manna, before our eyes.%0a%0a11:7 And the manna was as coriander seed, and the colour thereof as%0athe colour of bdellium.%0a%0a11:8 And the people went about, and gathered it, and ground it in%0amills, or beat it in a mortar, and baked it in pans, and made cakes of%0ait: and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil.%0a%0a11:9 And when the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell%0aupon it.%0a%0a11:10 Then Moses heard the people weep throughout their families,%0aevery man in the door of his tent: and the anger of the LORD was%0akindled greatly; Moses also was displeased.%0a%0a11:11 And Moses said unto the LORD, Wherefore hast thou afflicted thy%0aservant? and wherefore have I not found favour in thy sight, that thou%0alayest the burden of all this people upon me?  11:12 Have I conceived%0aall this people? have I begotten them, that thou shouldest say unto%0ame, Carry them in thy bosom, as a nursing father beareth the sucking%0achild, unto the land which thou swarest unto their fathers?  11:13%0aWhence should I have flesh to give unto all this people? for they weep%0aunto me, saying, Give us flesh, that we may eat.%0a%0a11:14 I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is too%0aheavy for me.%0a%0a11:15 And if thou deal thus with me, kill me, I pray thee, out of%0ahand, if I have found favour in thy sight; and let me not see my%0awretchedness.%0a%0a11:16 And the LORD said unto Moses, Gather unto me seventy men of the%0aelders of Israel, whom thou knowest to be the elders of the people,%0aand officers over them; and bring them unto the tabernacle of the%0acongregation, that they may stand there with thee.%0a%0a11:17 And I will come down and talk with thee there: and I will take%0aof the spirit which is upon thee, and will put it upon them; and they%0ashall bear the burden of the people with thee, that thou bear it not%0athyself alone.%0a%0a11:18 And say thou unto the people, Sanctify yourselves against to%0amorrow, and ye shall eat flesh: for ye have wept in the ears of the%0aLORD, saying, Who shall give us flesh to eat? for it was well with us%0ain Egypt: therefore the LORD will give you flesh, and ye shall eat.%0a%0a11:19 Ye shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither%0aten days, nor twenty days; 11:20 But even a whole month, until it come%0aout at your nostrils, and it be loathsome unto you: because that ye%0ahave despised the LORD which is among you, and have wept before him,%0asaying, Why came we forth out of Egypt?  11:21 And Moses said, The%0apeople, among whom I am, are six hundred thousand footmen; and thou%0ahast said, I will give them flesh, that they may eat a whole month.%0a%0a11:22 Shall the flocks and the herds be slain for them, to suffice%0athem?  or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them,%0ato suffice them?  11:23 And the LORD said unto Moses, Is the LORD's%0ahand waxed short? thou shalt see now whether my word shall come to%0apass unto thee or not.%0a%0a11:24 And Moses went out, and told the people the words of the LORD,%0aand gathered the seventy men of the elders of the people, and set them%0around about the tabernacle.%0a%0a11:25 And the LORD came down in a cloud, and spake unto him, and took%0aof the spirit that was upon him, and gave it unto the seventy elders:%0aand it came to pass, that, when the spirit rested upon them, they%0aprophesied, and did not cease.%0a%0a11:26 But there remained two of the men in the camp, the name of the%0aone was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad: and the spirit rested%0aupon them; and they were of them that were written, but went not out%0aunto the tabernacle: and they prophesied in the camp.%0a%0a11:27 And there ran a young man, and told Moses, and said, Eldad and%0aMedad do prophesy in the camp.%0a%0a11:28 And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Moses, one of his%0ayoung men, answered and said, My lord Moses, forbid them.%0a%0a11:29 And Moses said unto him, Enviest thou for my sake? would God%0athat all the LORD's people were prophets, and that the LORD would put%0ahis spirit upon them!  11:30 And Moses gat him into the camp, he and%0athe elders of Israel.%0a%0a11:31 And there went forth a wind from the LORD, and brought quails%0afrom the sea, and let them fall by the camp, as it were a day's%0ajourney on this side, and as it were a day's journey on the other%0aside, round about the camp, and as it were two cubits high upon the%0aface of the earth.%0a%0a11:32 And the people stood up all that day, and all that night, and%0aall the next day, and they gathered the quails: he that gathered least%0agathered ten homers: and they spread them all abroad for themselves%0around about the camp.%0a%0a11:33 And while the flesh was yet between their teeth, ere it was%0achewed, the wrath of the LORD was kindled against the people, and the%0aLORD smote the people with a very great plague.%0a%0a11:34 And he called the name of that place Kibrothhattaavah: because%0athere they buried the people that lusted.%0a%0a11:35 And the people journeyed from Kibrothhattaavah unto Hazeroth;%0aand abode at Hazeroth.%0a%0a12:1 And Miriam and Aaron spake against Moses because of the Ethiopian%0awoman whom he had married: for he had married an Ethiopian woman.%0a%0a12:2 And they said, Hath the LORD indeed spoken only by Moses? hath he%0anot spoken also by us? And the LORD heard it.%0a%0a12:3 (Now the man Moses was very meek, above all the men which were%0aupon the face of the earth.)  12:4 And the LORD spake suddenly unto%0aMoses, and unto Aaron, and unto Miriam, Come out ye three unto the%0atabernacle of the congregation. And they three came out.%0a%0a12:5 And the LORD came down in the pillar of the cloud, and stood in%0athe door of the tabernacle, and called Aaron and Miriam: and they both%0acame forth.%0a%0a12:6 And he said, Hear now my words: If there be a prophet among you,%0aI the LORD will make myself known unto him in a vision, and will speak%0aunto him in a dream.%0a%0a12:7 My servant Moses is not so, who is faithful in all mine house.%0a%0a12:8 With him will I speak mouth to mouth, even apparently, and not in%0adark speeches; and the similitude of the LORD shall he behold:%0awherefore then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant Moses?%0a12:9 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against them; and he%0adeparted.%0a%0a12:10 And the cloud departed from off the tabernacle; and, behold,%0aMiriam became leprous, white as snow: and Aaron looked upon Miriam,%0aand, behold, she was leprous.%0a%0a12:11 And Aaron said unto Moses, Alas, my lord, I beseech thee, lay%0anot the sin upon us, wherein we have done foolishly, and wherein we%0ahave sinned.%0a%0a12:12 Let her not be as one dead, of whom the flesh is half consumed%0awhen he cometh out of his mother's womb.%0a%0a12:13 And Moses cried unto the LORD, saying, Heal her now, O God, I%0abeseech thee.%0a%0a12:14 And the LORD said unto Moses, If her father had but spit in her%0aface, should she not be ashamed seven days? let her be shut out from%0athe camp seven days, and after that let her be received in again.%0a%0a12:15 And Miriam was shut out from the camp seven days: and the people%0ajourneyed not till Miriam was brought in again.%0a%0a12:16 And afterward the people removed from Hazeroth, and pitched in%0athe wilderness of Paran.%0a%0a13:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 13:2 Send thou men, that%0athey may search the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of%0aIsrael: of every tribe of their fathers shall ye send a man, every one%0aa ruler among them.%0a%0a13:3 And Moses by the commandment of the LORD sent them from the%0awilderness of Paran: all those men were heads of the children of%0aIsrael.%0a%0a13:4 And these were their names: of the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the%0ason of Zaccur.%0a%0a13:5 Of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori.%0a%0a13:6 Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh.%0a%0a13:7 Of the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph.%0a%0a13:8 Of the tribe of Ephraim, Oshea the son of Nun.%0a%0a13:9 Of the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu.%0a%0a13:10 Of the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi.%0a%0a13:11 Of the tribe of Joseph, namely, of the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi%0athe son of Susi.%0a%0a13:12 Of the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli.%0a%0a13:13 Of the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael.%0a%0a13:14 Of the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi.%0a%0a13:15 Of the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi.%0a%0a13:16 These are the names of the men which Moses sent to spy out the%0aland.%0a%0aAnd Moses called Oshea the son of Nun Jehoshua.%0a%0a13:17 And Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said unto%0athem, Get you up this way southward, and go up into the mountain:%0a13:18 And see the land, what it is, and the people that dwelleth%0atherein, whether they be strong or weak, few or many; 13:19 And what%0athe land is that they dwell in, whether it be good or bad; and what%0acities they be that they dwell in, whether in tents, or in strong%0aholds; 13:20 And what the land is, whether it be fat or lean, whether%0athere be wood therein, or not. And be ye of good courage, and bring of%0athe fruit of the land. Now the time was the time of the firstripe%0agrapes.%0a%0a13:21 So they went up, and searched the land from the wilderness of%0aZin unto Rehob, as men come to Hamath.%0a%0a13:22 And they ascended by the south, and came unto Hebron; where%0aAhiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, were. (Now Hebron%0awas built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)  13:23 And they came unto%0athe brook of Eshcol, and cut down from thence a branch with one%0acluster of grapes, and they bare it between two upon a staff; and they%0abrought of the pomegranates, and of the figs.%0a%0a13:24 The place was called the brook Eshcol, because of the cluster of%0agrapes which the children of Israel cut down from thence.%0a%0a13:25 And they returned from searching of the land after forty days.%0a%0a13:26 And they went and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the%0acongregation of the children of Israel, unto the wilderness of Paran,%0ato Kadesh; and brought back word unto them, and unto all the%0acongregation, and shewed them the fruit of the land.%0a%0a13:27 And they told him, and said, We came unto the land whither thou%0asentest us, and surely it floweth with milk and honey; and this is the%0afruit of it.%0a%0a13:28 Nevertheless the people be strong that dwell in the land, and%0athe cities are walled, and very great: and moreover we saw the%0achildren of Anak there.%0a%0a13:29 The Amalekites dwell in the land of the south: and the Hittites,%0aand the Jebusites, and the Amorites, dwell in the mountains: and the%0aCanaanites dwell by the sea, and by the coast of Jordan.%0a%0a13:30 And Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, Let us go%0aup at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it.%0a%0a13:31 But the men that went up with him said, We be not able to go up%0aagainst the people; for they are stronger than we.%0a%0a13:32 And they brought up an evil report of the land which they had%0asearched unto the children of Israel, saying, The land, through which%0awe have gone to search it, is a land that eateth up the inhabitants%0athereof; and all the people that we saw in it are men of a great%0astature.%0a%0a13:33 And there we saw the giants, the sons of Anak, which come of the%0agiants: and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were%0ain their sight.%0a%0a14:1 And all the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried; and%0athe people wept that night.%0a%0a14:2 And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against%0aAaron: and the whole congregation said unto them, Would God that we%0ahad died in the land of Egypt! or would God we had died in this%0awilderness!  14:3 And wherefore hath the LORD brought us unto this%0aland, to fall by the sword, that our wives and our children should be%0aa prey? were it not better for us to return into Egypt?  14:4 And they%0asaid one to another, Let us make a captain, and let us return into%0aEgypt.%0a%0a14:5 Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly%0aof the congregation of the children of Israel.%0a%0a14:6 And Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, which%0awere of them that searched the land, rent their clothes: 14:7 And they%0aspake unto all the company of the children of Israel, saying, The%0aland, which we passed through to search it, is an exceeding good land.%0a%0a14:8 If the LORD delight in us, then he will bring us into this land,%0aand give it us; a land which floweth with milk and honey.%0a%0a14:9 Only rebel not ye against the LORD, neither fear ye the people of%0athe land; for they are bread for us: their defence is departed from%0athem, and the LORD is with us: fear them not.%0a%0a14:10 But all the congregation bade stone them with stones. And the%0aglory of the LORD appeared in the tabernacle of the congregation%0abefore all the children of Israel.%0a%0a14:11 And the LORD said unto Moses, How long will this people provoke%0ame?  and how long will it be ere they believe me, for all the signs%0awhich I have shewed among them?  14:12 I will smite them with the%0apestilence, and disinherit them, and will make of thee a greater%0anation and mightier than they.%0a%0a14:13 And Moses said unto the LORD, Then the Egyptians shall hear it,%0a(for thou broughtest up this people in thy might from among them;)%0a14:14 And they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land: for they%0ahave heard that thou LORD art among this people, that thou LORD art%0aseen face to face, and that thy cloud standeth over them, and that%0athou goest before them, by day time in a pillar of a cloud, and in a%0apillar of fire by night.%0a%0a14:15 Now if thou shalt kill all this people as one man, then the%0anations which have heard the fame of thee will speak, saying, 14:16%0aBecause the LORD was not able to bring this people into the land which%0ahe sware unto them, therefore he hath slain them in the wilderness.%0a%0a14:17 And now, I beseech thee, let the power of my LORD be great,%0aaccording as thou hast spoken, saying, 14:18 The LORD is%0alongsuffering, and of great mercy, forgiving iniquity and%0atransgression, and by no means clearing the guilty, visiting the%0ainiquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth%0ageneration.%0a%0a14:19 Pardon, I beseech thee, the iniquity of this people according%0aunto the greatness of thy mercy, and as thou hast forgiven this%0apeople, from Egypt even until now.%0a%0a14:20 And the LORD said, I have pardoned according to thy word: 14:21%0aBut as truly as I live, all the earth shall be filled with the glory%0aof the LORD.%0a%0a14:22 Because all those men which have seen my glory, and my miracles,%0awhich I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and have tempted me now%0athese ten times, and have not hearkened to my voice; 14:23 Surely they%0ashall not see the land which I sware unto their fathers, neither shall%0aany of them that provoked me see it: 14:24 But my servant Caleb,%0abecause he had another spirit with him, and hath followed me fully,%0ahim will I bring into the land whereinto he went; and his seed shall%0apossess it.%0a%0a14:25 (Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites dwelt in the valley.)%0aTomorrow turn you, and get you into the wilderness by the way of the%0aRed sea.%0a%0a14:26 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, 14:27 How%0along shall I bear with this evil congregation, which murmur against%0ame? I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they%0amurmur against me.%0a%0a14:28 Say unto them, As truly as I live, saith the LORD, as ye have%0aspoken in mine ears, so will I do to you: 14:29 Your carcases shall%0afall in this wilderness; and all that were numbered of you, according%0ato your whole number, from twenty years old and upward which have%0amurmured against me.%0a%0a14:30 Doubtless ye shall not come into the land, concerning which I%0asware to make you dwell therein, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and%0aJoshua the son of Nun.%0a%0a14:31 But your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, them will%0aI bring in, and they shall know the land which ye have despised.%0a%0a14:32 But as for you, your carcases, they shall fall in this%0awilderness.%0a%0a14:33 And your children shall wander in the wilderness forty years,%0aand bear your whoredoms, until your carcases be wasted in the%0awilderness.%0a%0a14:34 After the number of the days in which ye searched the land, even%0aforty days, each day for a year, shall ye bear your iniquities, even%0aforty years, and ye shall know my breach of promise.%0a%0a14:35 I the LORD have said, I will surely do it unto all this evil%0acongregation, that are gathered together against me: in this%0awilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall die.%0a%0a14:36 And the men, which Moses sent to search the land, who returned,%0aand made all the congregation to murmur against him, by bringing up a%0aslander upon the land, 14:37 Even those men that did bring up the evil%0areport upon the land, died by the plague before the LORD.%0a%0a14:38 But Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, which%0awere of the men that went to search the land, lived still.%0a%0a14:39 And Moses told these sayings unto all the children of Israel:%0aand the people mourned greatly.%0a%0a14:40 And they rose up early in the morning, and gat them up into the%0atop of the mountain, saying, Lo, we be here, and will go up unto the%0aplace which the LORD hath promised: for we have sinned.%0a%0a14:41 And Moses said, Wherefore now do ye transgress the commandment%0aof the LORD? but it shall not prosper.%0a%0a14:42 Go not up, for the LORD is not among you; that ye be not smitten%0abefore your enemies.%0a%0a14:43 For the Amalekites and the Canaanites are there before you, and%0aye shall fall by the sword: because ye are turned away from the LORD,%0atherefore the LORD will not be with you.%0a%0a14:44 But they presumed to go up unto the hill top: nevertheless the%0aark of the covenant of the LORD, and Moses, departed not out of the%0acamp.%0a%0a14:45 Then the Amalekites came down, and the Canaanites which dwelt in%0athat hill, and smote them, and discomfited them, even unto Hormah.%0a%0a15:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 15:2 Speak unto the%0achildren of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come into the land%0aof your habitations, which I give unto you, 15:3 And will make an%0aoffering by fire unto the LORD, a burnt offering, or a sacrifice in%0aperforming a vow, or in a freewill offering, or in your solemn feasts,%0ato make a sweet savour unto the LORD, of the herd or of the flock:%0a15:4 Then shall he that offereth his offering unto the LORD bring a%0ameat offering of a tenth deal of flour mingled with the fourth part of%0aan hin of oil.%0a%0a15:5 And the fourth part of an hin of wine for a drink offering shalt%0athou prepare with the burnt offering or sacrifice, for one lamb.%0a%0a15:6 Or for a ram, thou shalt prepare for a meat offering two tenth%0adeals of flour mingled with the third part of an hin of oil.%0a%0a15:7 And for a drink offering thou shalt offer the third part of an%0ahin of wine, for a sweet savour unto the LORD.%0a%0a15:8 And when thou preparest a bullock for a burnt offering, or for a%0asacrifice in performing a vow, or peace offerings unto the LORD: 15:9%0aThen shall he bring with a bullock a meat offering of three tenth%0adeals of flour mingled with half an hin of oil.%0a%0a15:10 And thou shalt bring for a drink offering half an hin of wine,%0afor an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.%0a%0a15:11 Thus shall it be done for one bullock, or for one ram, or for a%0alamb, or a kid.%0a%0a15:12 According to the number that ye shall prepare, so shall ye do to%0aevery one according to their number.%0a%0a15:13 All that are born of the country shall do these things after%0athis manner, in offering an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour%0aunto the LORD.%0a%0a15:14 And if a stranger sojourn with you, or whosoever be among you in%0ayour generations, and will offer an offering made by fire, of a sweet%0asavour unto the LORD; as ye do, so he shall do.%0a%0a15:15 One ordinance shall be both for you of the congregation, and%0aalso for the stranger that sojourneth with you, an ordinance for ever%0ain your generations: as ye are, so shall the stranger be before the%0aLORD.%0a%0a15:16 One law and one manner shall be for you, and for the stranger%0athat sojourneth with you.%0a%0a15:17 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 15:18 Speak unto the%0achildren of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land%0awhither I bring you, 15:19 Then it shall be, that, when ye eat of the%0abread of the land, ye shall offer up an heave offering unto the LORD.%0a%0a15:20 Ye shall offer up a cake of the first of your dough for an heave%0aoffering: as ye do the heave offering of the threshingfloor, so shall%0aye heave it.%0a%0a15:21 Of the first of your dough ye shall give unto the LORD an heave%0aoffering in your generations.%0a%0a15:22 And if ye have erred, and not observed all these commandments,%0awhich the LORD hath spoken unto Moses, 15:23 Even all that the LORD%0ahath commanded you by the hand of Moses, from the day that the LORD%0acommanded Moses, and henceforward among your generations; 15:24 Then%0ait shall be, if ought be committed by ignorance without the knowledge%0aof the congregation, that all the congregation shall offer one young%0abullock for a burnt offering, for a sweet savour unto the LORD, with%0ahis meat offering, and his drink offering, according to the manner,%0aand one kid of the goats for a sin offering.%0a%0a15:25 And the priest shall make an atonement for all the congregation%0aof the children of Israel, and it shall be forgiven them; for it is%0aignorance: and they shall bring their offering, a sacrifice made by%0afire unto the LORD, and their sin offering before the LORD, for their%0aignorance: 15:26 And it shall be forgiven all the congregation of the%0achildren of Israel, and the stranger that sojourneth among them;%0aseeing all the people were in ignorance.%0a%0a15:27 And if any soul sin through ignorance, then he shall bring a she%0agoat of the first year for a sin offering.%0a%0a15:28 And the priest shall make an atonement for the soul that sinneth%0aignorantly, when he sinneth by ignorance before the LORD, to make an%0aatonement for him; and it shall be forgiven him.%0a%0a15:29 Ye shall have one law for him that sinneth through ignorance,%0aboth for him that is born among the children of Israel, and for the%0astranger that sojourneth among them.%0a%0a15:30 But the soul that doeth ought presumptuously, whether he be born%0ain the land, or a stranger, the same reproacheth the LORD; and that%0asoul shall be cut off from among his people.%0a%0a15:31 Because he hath despised the word of the LORD, and hath broken%0ahis commandment, that soul shall utterly be cut off; his iniquity%0ashall be upon him.%0a%0a15:32 And while the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they%0afound a man that gathered sticks upon the sabbath day.%0a%0a15:33 And they that found him gathering sticks brought him unto Moses%0aand Aaron, and unto all the congregation.%0a%0a15:34 And they put him in ward, because it was not declared what%0ashould be done to him.%0a%0a15:35 And the LORD said unto Moses, The man shall be surely put to%0adeath: all the congregation shall stone him with stones without the%0acamp.%0a%0a15:36 And all the congregation brought him without the camp, and%0astoned him with stones, and he died; as the LORD commanded Moses.%0a%0a15:37 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 15:38 Speak unto the%0achildren of Israel, and bid them that they make them fringes in the%0aborders of their garments throughout their generations, and that they%0aput upon the fringe of the borders a ribband of blue: 15:39 And it%0ashall be unto you for a fringe, that ye may look upon it, and remember%0aall the commandments of the LORD, and do them; and that ye seek not%0aafter your own heart and your own eyes, after which ye use to go a%0awhoring: 15:40 That ye may remember, and do all my commandments, and%0abe holy unto your God.%0a%0a15:41 I am the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of%0aEgypt, to be your God: I am the LORD your God.%0a%0a16:1 Now Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi,%0aand Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On, the son of Peleth,%0asons of Reuben, took men: 16:2 And they rose up before Moses, with%0acertain of the children of Israel, two hundred and fifty princes of%0athe assembly, famous in the congregation, men of renown: 16:3 And they%0agathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron, and said%0aunto them, Ye take too much upon you, seeing all the congregation are%0aholy, every one of them, and the LORD is among them: wherefore then%0alift ye up yourselves above the congregation of the LORD?  16:4 And%0awhen Moses heard it, he fell upon his face: 16:5 And he spake unto%0aKorah and unto all his company, saying, Even to morrow the LORD will%0ashew who are his, and who is holy; and will cause him to come near%0aunto him: even him whom he hath chosen will he cause to come near unto%0ahim.%0a%0a16:6 This do; Take you censers, Korah, and all his company; 16:7 And%0aput fire therein, and put incense in them before the LORD to morrow:%0aand it shall be that the man whom the LORD doth choose, he shall be%0aholy: ye take too much upon you, ye sons of Levi.%0a%0a16:8 And Moses said unto Korah, Hear, I pray you, ye sons of Levi:%0a16:9 Seemeth it but a small thing unto you, that the God of Israel%0ahath separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near%0ato himself to do the service of the tabernacle of the LORD, and to%0astand before the congregation to minister unto them?  16:10 And he%0ahath brought thee near to him, and all thy brethren the sons of Levi%0awith thee: and seek ye the priesthood also?  16:11 For which cause%0aboth thou and all thy company are gathered together against the LORD:%0aand what is Aaron, that ye murmur against him?  16:12 And Moses sent%0ato call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab: which said, We will not%0acome up: 16:13 Is it a small thing that thou hast brought us up out of%0aa land that floweth with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness,%0aexcept thou make thyself altogether a prince over us?  16:14 Moreover%0athou hast not brought us into a land that floweth with milk and honey,%0aor given us inheritance of fields and vineyards: wilt thou put out the%0aeyes of these men? we will not come up.%0a%0a16:15 And Moses was very wroth, and said unto the LORD, Respect not%0athou their offering: I have not taken one ass from them, neither have%0aI hurt one of them.%0a%0a16:16 And Moses said unto Korah, Be thou and all thy company before%0athe LORD, thou, and they, and Aaron, to morrow: 16:17 And take every%0aman his censer, and put incense in them, and bring ye before the LORD%0aevery man his censer, two hundred and fifty censers; thou also, and%0aAaron, each of you his censer.%0a%0a16:18 And they took every man his censer, and put fire in them, and%0alaid incense thereon, and stood in the door of the tabernacle of the%0acongregation with Moses and Aaron.%0a%0a16:19 And Korah gathered all the congregation against them unto the%0adoor of the tabernacle of the congregation: and the glory of the LORD%0aappeared unto all the congregation.%0a%0a16:20 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, 16:21%0aSeparate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consume%0athem in a moment.%0a%0a16:22 And they fell upon their faces, and said, O God, the God of the%0aspirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and wilt thou be wroth with%0aall the congregation?  16:23 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,%0a16:24 Speak unto the congregation, saying, Get you up from about the%0atabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.%0a%0a16:25 And Moses rose up and went unto Dathan and Abiram; and the%0aelders of Israel followed him.%0a%0a16:26 And he spake unto the congregation, saying, Depart, I pray you,%0afrom the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of their's, lest%0aye be consumed in all their sins.%0a%0a16:27 So they gat up from the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram,%0aon every side: and Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood in the door%0aof their tents, and their wives, and their sons, and their little%0achildren.%0a%0a16:28 And Moses said, Hereby ye shall know that the LORD hath sent me%0ato do all these works; for I have not done them of mine own mind.%0a%0a16:29 If these men die the common death of all men, or if they be%0avisited after the visitation of all men; then the LORD hath not sent%0ame.%0a%0a16:30 But if the LORD make a new thing, and the earth open her mouth,%0aand swallow them up, with all that appertain unto them, and they go%0adown quick into the pit; then ye shall understand that these men have%0aprovoked the LORD.%0a%0a16:31 And it came to pass, as he had made an end of speaking all these%0awords, that the ground clave asunder that was under them: 16:32 And%0athe earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their houses,%0aand all the men that appertained unto Korah, and all their goods.%0a%0a16:33 They, and all that appertained to them, went down alive into the%0apit, and the earth closed upon them: and they perished from among the%0acongregation.%0a%0a16:34 And all Israel that were round about them fled at the cry of%0athem: for they said, Lest the earth swallow us up also.%0a%0a16:35 And there came out a fire from the LORD, and consumed the two%0ahundred and fifty men that offered incense.%0a%0a16:36 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 16:37 Speak unto Eleazar%0athe son of Aaron the priest, that he take up the censers out of the%0aburning, and scatter thou the fire yonder; for they are hallowed.%0a%0a16:38 The censers of these sinners against their own souls, let them%0amake them broad plates for a covering of the altar: for they offered%0athem before the LORD, therefore they are hallowed: and they shall be a%0asign unto the children of Israel.%0a%0a16:39 And Eleazar the priest took the brasen censers, wherewith they%0athat were burnt had offered; and they were made broad plates for a%0acovering of the altar: 16:40 To be a memorial unto the children of%0aIsrael, that no stranger, which is not of the seed of Aaron, come near%0ato offer incense before the LORD; that he be not as Korah, and as his%0acompany: as the LORD said to him by the hand of Moses.%0a%0a16:41 But on the morrow all the congregation of the children of Israel%0amurmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying, Ye have killed the%0apeople of the LORD.%0a%0a16:42 And it came to pass, when the congregation was gathered against%0aMoses and against Aaron, that they looked toward the tabernacle of the%0acongregation: and, behold, the cloud covered it, and the glory of the%0aLORD appeared.%0a%0a16:43 And Moses and Aaron came before the tabernacle of the%0acongregation.%0a%0a16:44 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 16:45 Get you up from%0aamong this congregation, that I may consume them as in a moment. And%0athey fell upon their faces.%0a%0a16:46 And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a censer, and put fire therein%0afrom off the altar, and put on incense, and go quickly unto the%0acongregation, and make an atonement for them: for there is wrath gone%0aout from the LORD; the plague is begun.%0a%0a16:47 And Aaron took as Moses commanded, and ran into the midst of the%0acongregation; and, behold, the plague was begun among the people: and%0ahe put on incense, and made an atonement for the people.%0a%0a16:48 And he stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was%0astayed.%0a%0a16:49 Now they that died in the plague were fourteen thousand and%0aseven hundred, beside them that died about the matter of Korah.%0a%0a16:50 And Aaron returned unto Moses unto the door of the tabernacle of%0athe congregation: and the plague was stayed.%0a%0a17:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 17:2 Speak unto the%0achildren of Israel, and take of every one of them a rod according to%0athe house of their fathers, of all their princes according to the%0ahouse of their fathers twelve rods: write thou every man's name upon%0ahis rod.%0a%0a17:3 And thou shalt write Aaron's name upon the rod of Levi: for one%0arod shall be for the head of the house of their fathers.%0a%0a17:4 And thou shalt lay them up in the tabernacle of the congregation%0abefore the testimony, where I will meet with you.%0a%0a17:5 And it shall come to pass, that the man's rod, whom I shall%0achoose, shall blossom: and I will make to cease from me the murmurings%0aof the children of Israel, whereby they murmur against you.%0a%0a17:6 And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, and every one of%0atheir princes gave him a rod apiece, for each prince one, according to%0atheir fathers' houses, even twelve rods: and the rod of Aaron was%0aamong their rods.%0a%0a17:7 And Moses laid up the rods before the LORD in the tabernacle of%0awitness.%0a%0a17:8 And it came to pass, that on the morrow Moses went into the%0atabernacle of witness; and, behold, the rod of Aaron for the house of%0aLevi was budded, and brought forth buds, and bloomed blossoms, and%0ayielded almonds.%0a%0a17:9 And Moses brought out all the rods from before the LORD unto all%0athe children of Israel: and they looked, and took every man his rod.%0a%0a17:10 And the LORD said unto Moses, Bring Aaron's rod again before the%0atestimony, to be kept for a token against the rebels; and thou shalt%0aquite take away their murmurings from me, that they die not.%0a%0a17:11 And Moses did so: as the LORD commanded him, so did he.%0a%0a17:12 And the children of Israel spake unto Moses, saying, Behold, we%0adie, we perish, we all perish.%0a%0a17:13 Whosoever cometh any thing near unto the tabernacle of the LORD%0ashall die: shall we be consumed with dying?  18:1 And the LORD said%0aunto Aaron, Thou and thy sons and thy father's house with thee shall%0abear the iniquity of the sanctuary: and thou and thy sons with thee%0ashall bear the iniquity of your priesthood.%0a%0a18:2 And thy brethren also of the tribe of Levi, the tribe of thy%0afather, bring thou with thee, that they may be joined unto thee, and%0aminister unto thee: but thou and thy sons with thee shall minister%0abefore the tabernacle of witness.%0a%0a18:3 And they shall keep thy charge, and the charge of all the%0atabernacle: only they shall not come nigh the vessels of the sanctuary%0aand the altar, that neither they, nor ye also, die.%0a%0a18:4 And they shall be joined unto thee, and keep the charge of the%0atabernacle of the congregation, for all the service of the tabernacle:%0aand a stranger shall not come nigh unto you.%0a%0a18:5 And ye shall keep the charge of the sanctuary, and the charge of%0athe altar: that there be no wrath any more upon the children of%0aIsrael.%0a%0a18:6 And I, behold, I have taken your brethren the Levites from among%0athe children of Israel: to you they are given as a gift for the LORD,%0ato do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation.%0a%0a18:7 Therefore thou and thy sons with thee shall keep your priest's%0aoffice for everything of the altar, and within the vail; and ye shall%0aserve: I have given your priest's office unto you as a service of%0agift: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death.%0a%0a18:8 And the LORD spake unto Aaron, Behold, I also have given thee the%0acharge of mine heave offerings of all the hallowed things of the%0achildren of Israel; unto thee have I given them by reason of the%0aanointing, and to thy sons, by an ordinance for ever.%0a%0a18:9 This shall be thine of the most holy things, reserved from the%0afire: every oblation of theirs, every meat offering of theirs, and%0aevery sin offering of theirs, and every trespass offering of theirs%0awhich they shall render unto me, shall be most holy for thee and for%0athy sons.%0a%0a18:10 In the most holy place shalt thou eat it; every male shall eat%0ait: it shall be holy unto thee.%0a%0a18:11 And this is thine; the heave offering of their gift, with all%0athe wave offerings of the children of Israel: I have given them unto%0athee, and to thy sons and to thy daughters with thee, by a statute for%0aever: every one that is clean in thy house shall eat of it.%0a%0a18:12 All the best of the oil, and all the best of the wine, and of%0athe wheat, the firstfruits of them which they shall offer unto the%0aLORD, them have I given thee.%0a%0a18:13 And whatsoever is first ripe in the land, which they shall bring%0aunto the LORD, shall be thine; every one that is clean in thine house%0ashall eat of it.%0a%0a18:14 Every thing devoted in Israel shall be thine.%0a%0a18:15 Every thing that openeth the matrix in all flesh, which they%0abring unto the LORD, whether it be of men or beasts, shall be thine:%0anevertheless the firstborn of man shalt thou surely redeem, and the%0afirstling of unclean beasts shalt thou redeem.%0a%0a18:16 And those that are to be redeemed from a month old shalt thou%0aredeem, according to thine estimation, for the money of five shekels,%0aafter the shekel of the sanctuary, which is twenty gerahs.%0a%0a18:17 But the firstling of a cow, or the firstling of a sheep, or the%0afirstling of a goat, thou shalt not redeem; they are holy: thou shalt%0asprinkle their blood upon the altar, and shalt burn their fat for an%0aoffering made by fire, for a sweet savour unto the LORD.%0a%0a18:18 And the flesh of them shall be thine, as the wave breast and as%0athe right shoulder are thine.%0a%0a18:19 All the heave offerings of the holy things, which the children%0aof Israel offer unto the LORD, have I given thee, and thy sons and thy%0adaughters with thee, by a statute for ever: it is a covenant of salt%0afor ever before the LORD unto thee and to thy seed with thee.%0a%0a18:20 And the LORD spake unto Aaron, Thou shalt have no inheritance in%0atheir land, neither shalt thou have any part among them: I am thy part%0aand thine inheritance among the children of Israel.%0a%0a18:21 And, behold, I have given the children of Levi all the tenth in%0aIsrael for an inheritance, for their service which they serve, even%0athe service of the tabernacle of the congregation.%0a%0a18:22 Neither must the children of Israel henceforth come nigh the%0atabernacle of the congregation, lest they bear sin, and die.%0a%0a18:23 But the Levites shall do the service of the tabernacle of the%0acongregation, and they shall bear their iniquity: it shall be a%0astatute for ever throughout your generations, that among the children%0aof Israel they have no inheritance.%0a%0a18:24 But the tithes of the children of Israel, which they offer as an%0aheave offering unto the LORD, I have given to the Levites to inherit:%0atherefore I have said unto them, Among the children of Israel they%0ashall have no inheritance.%0a%0a18:25 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 18:26 Thus speak unto the%0aLevites, and say unto them, When ye take of the children of Israel the%0atithes which I have given you from them for your inheritance, then ye%0ashall offer up an heave offering of it for the LORD, even a tenth part%0aof the tithe.%0a%0a18:27 And this your heave offering shall be reckoned unto you, as%0athough it were the corn of the threshingfloor, and as the fulness of%0athe winepress.%0a%0a18:28 Thus ye also shall offer an heave offering unto the LORD of all%0ayour tithes, which ye receive of the children of Israel; and ye shall%0agive thereof the LORD's heave offering to Aaron the priest.%0a%0a18:29 Out of all your gifts ye shall offer every heave offering of the%0aLORD, of all the best thereof, even the hallowed part thereof out of%0ait.%0a%0a18:30 Therefore thou shalt say unto them, When ye have heaved the best%0athereof from it, then it shall be counted unto the Levites as the%0aincrease of the threshingfloor, and as the increase of the winepress.%0a%0a18:31 And ye shall eat it in every place, ye and your households: for%0ait is your reward for your service in the tabernacle of the%0acongregation.%0a%0a18:32 And ye shall bear no sin by reason of it, when ye have heaved%0afrom it the best of it: neither shall ye pollute the holy things of%0athe children of Israel, lest ye die.%0a%0a19:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, 19:2 This%0ais the ordinance of the law which the LORD hath commanded, saying,%0aSpeak unto the children of Israel, that they bring thee a red heifer%0awithout spot, wherein is no blemish, and upon which never came yoke:%0a19:3 And ye shall give her unto Eleazar the priest, that he may bring%0aher forth without the camp, and one shall slay her before his face:%0a19:4 And Eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger,%0aand sprinkle of her blood directly before the tabernacle of the%0acongregation seven times: 19:5 And one shall burn the heifer in his%0asight; her skin, and her flesh, and her blood, with her dung, shall he%0aburn: 19:6 And the priest shall take cedar wood, and hyssop, and%0ascarlet, and cast it into the midst of the burning of the heifer.%0a%0a19:7 Then the priest shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe his%0aflesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp, and the%0apriest shall be unclean until the even.%0a%0a19:8 And he that burneth her shall wash his clothes in water, and%0abathe his flesh in water, and shall be unclean until the even.%0a%0a19:9 And a man that is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer,%0aand lay them up without the camp in a clean place, and it shall be%0akept for the congregation of the children of Israel for a water of%0aseparation: it is a purification for sin.%0a%0a19:10 And he that gathereth the ashes of the heifer shall wash his%0aclothes, and be unclean until the even: and it shall be unto the%0achildren of Israel, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among them,%0afor a statute for ever.%0a%0a19:11 He that toucheth the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven%0adays.%0a%0a19:12 He shall purify himself with it on the third day, and on the%0aseventh day he shall be clean: but if he purify not himself the third%0aday, then the seventh day he shall not be clean.%0a%0a19:13 Whosoever toucheth the dead body of any man that is dead, and%0apurifieth not himself, defileth the tabernacle of the LORD; and that%0asoul shall be cut off from Israel: because the water of separation was%0anot sprinkled upon him, he shall be unclean; his uncleanness is yet%0aupon him.%0a%0a19:14 This is the law, when a man dieth in a tent: all that come into%0athe tent, and all that is in the tent, shall be unclean seven days.%0a%0a19:15 And every open vessel, which hath no covering bound upon it, is%0aunclean.%0a%0a19:16 And whosoever toucheth one that is slain with a sword in the%0aopen fields, or a dead body, or a bone of a man, or a grave, shall be%0aunclean seven days.%0a%0a19:17 And for an unclean person they shall take of the ashes of the%0aburnt heifer of purification for sin, and running water shall be put%0athereto in a vessel: 19:18 And a clean person shall take hyssop, and%0adip it in the water, and sprinkle it upon the tent, and upon all the%0avessels, and upon the persons that were there, and upon him that%0atouched a bone, or one slain, or one dead, or a grave: 19:19 And the%0aclean person shall sprinkle upon the unclean on the third day, and on%0athe seventh day: and on the seventh day he shall purify himself, and%0awash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and shall be clean at%0aeven.%0a%0a19:20 But the man that shall be unclean, and shall not purify himself,%0athat soul shall be cut off from among the congregation, because he%0ahath defiled the sanctuary of the LORD: the water of separation hath%0anot been sprinkled upon him; he is unclean.%0a%0a19:21 And it shall be a perpetual statute unto them, that he that%0asprinkleth the water of separation shall wash his clothes; and he that%0atoucheth the water of separation shall be unclean until even.%0a%0a19:22 And whatsoever the unclean person toucheth shall be unclean; and%0athe soul that toucheth it shall be unclean until even.%0a%0a20:1 Then came the children of Israel, even the whole congregation,%0ainto the desert of Zin in the first month: and the people abode in%0aKadesh; and Miriam died there, and was buried there.%0a%0a20:2 And there was no water for the congregation: and they gathered%0athemselves together against Moses and against Aaron.%0a%0a20:3 And the people chode with Moses, and spake, saying, Would God%0athat we had died when our brethren died before the LORD!  20:4 And why%0ahave ye brought up the congregation of the LORD into this wilderness,%0athat we and our cattle should die there?  20:5 And wherefore have ye%0amade us to come up out of Egypt, to bring us in unto this evil place?%0ait is no place of seed, or of figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates;%0aneither is there any water to drink.%0a%0a20:6 And Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly unto%0athe door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they fell upon%0atheir faces: and the glory of the LORD appeared unto them.%0a%0a20:7 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 20:8 Take the rod, and%0agather thou the assembly together, thou, and Aaron thy brother, and%0aspeak ye unto the rock before their eyes; and it shall give forth his%0awater, and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock: so%0athou shalt give the congregation and their beasts drink.%0a%0a20:9 And Moses took the rod from before the LORD, as he commanded him.%0a%0a20:10 And Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before%0athe rock, and he said unto them, Hear now, ye rebels; must we fetch%0ayou water out of this rock?  20:11 And Moses lifted up his hand, and%0awith his rod he smote the rock twice: and the water came out%0aabundantly, and the congregation drank, and their beasts also.%0a%0a20:12 And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron, Because ye believed me%0anot, to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel, therefore%0aye shall not bring this congregation into the land which I have given%0athem.%0a%0a20:13 This is the water of Meribah; because the children of Israel%0astrove with the LORD, and he was sanctified in them.%0a%0a20:14 And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh unto the king of Edom,%0aThus saith thy brother Israel, Thou knowest all the travail that hath%0abefallen us: 20:15 How our fathers went down into Egypt, and we have%0adwelt in Egypt a long time; and the Egyptians vexed us, and our%0afathers: 20:16 And when we cried unto the LORD, he heard our voice,%0aand sent an angel, and hath brought us forth out of Egypt: and,%0abehold, we are in Kadesh, a city in the uttermost of thy border: 20:17%0aLet us pass, I pray thee, through thy country: we will not pass%0athrough the fields, or through the vineyards, neither will we drink of%0athe water of the wells: we will go by the king's high way, we will not%0aturn to the right hand nor to the left, until we have passed thy%0aborders.%0a%0a20:18 And Edom said unto him, Thou shalt not pass by me, lest I come%0aout against thee with the sword.%0a%0a20:19 And the children of Israel said unto him, We will go by the high%0away: and if I and my cattle drink of thy water, then I will pay for%0ait: I will only, without doing anything else, go through on my feet.%0a%0a20:20 And he said, Thou shalt not go through. And Edom came out%0aagainst him with much people, and with a strong hand.%0a%0a20:21 Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border:%0awherefore Israel turned away from him.%0a%0a20:22 And the children of Israel, even the whole congregation,%0ajourneyed from Kadesh, and came unto mount Hor.%0a%0a20:23 And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron in mount Hor, by the%0acoast of the land of Edom, saying, 20:24 Aaron shall be gathered unto%0ahis people: for he shall not enter into the land which I have given%0aunto the children of Israel, because ye rebelled against my word at%0athe water of Meribah.%0a%0a20:25 Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up unto mount%0aHor: 20:26 And strip Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar%0ahis son: and Aaron shall be gathered unto his people, and shall die%0athere.%0a%0a20:27 And Moses did as the LORD commanded: and they went up into mount%0aHor in the sight of all the congregation.%0a%0a20:28 And Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and put them upon%0aEleazar his son; and Aaron died there in the top of the mount: and%0aMoses and Eleazar came down from the mount.%0a%0a20:29 And when all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead, they%0amourned for Aaron thirty days, even all the house of Israel.%0a%0a21:1 And when king Arad the Canaanite, which dwelt in the south, heard%0atell that Israel came by the way of the spies; then he fought against%0aIsrael, and took some of them prisoners.%0a%0a21:2 And Israel vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said, If thou wilt%0aindeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly destroy%0atheir cities.%0a%0a21:3 And the LORD hearkened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up%0athe Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them and their cities: and%0ahe called the name of the place Hormah.%0a%0a21:4 And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way of the Red sea, to%0acompass the land of Edom: and the soul of the people was much%0adiscouraged because of the way.%0a%0a21:5 And the people spake against God, and against Moses, Wherefore%0ahave ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? for there%0ais no bread, neither is there any water; and our soul loatheth this%0alight bread.%0a%0a21:6 And the LORD sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit%0athe people; and much people of Israel died.%0a%0a21:7 Therefore the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned, for%0awe have spoken against the LORD, and against thee; pray unto the LORD,%0athat he take away the serpents from us. And Moses prayed for the%0apeople.%0a%0a21:8 And the LORD said unto Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent, and set%0ait upon a pole: and it shall come to pass, that every one that is%0abitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live.%0a%0a21:9 And Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole, and it%0acame to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the%0aserpent of brass, he lived.%0a%0a21:10 And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in Oboth.%0a%0a21:11 And they journeyed from Oboth, and pitched at Ijeabarim, in the%0awilderness which is before Moab, toward the sunrising.%0a%0a21:12 From thence they removed, and pitched in the valley of Zared.%0a%0a21:13 From thence they removed, and pitched on the other side of%0aArnon, which is in the wilderness that cometh out of the coasts of the%0aAmorites: for Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the%0aAmorites.%0a%0a21:14 Wherefore it is said in the book of the wars of the LORD, What%0ahe did in the Red sea, and in the brooks of Arnon, 21:15 And at the%0astream of the brooks that goeth down to the dwelling of Ar, and lieth%0aupon the border of Moab.%0a%0a21:16 And from thence they went to Beer: that is the well whereof the%0aLORD spake unto Moses, Gather the people together, and I will give%0athem water.%0a%0a21:17 Then Israel sang this song, Spring up, O well; sing ye unto it:%0a21:18 The princes digged the well, the nobles of the people digged it,%0aby the direction of the lawgiver, with their staves. And from the%0awilderness they went to Mattanah: 21:19 And from Mattanah to Nahaliel:%0aand from Nahaliel to Bamoth: 21:20 And from Bamoth in the valley, that%0ais in the country of Moab, to the top of Pisgah, which looketh toward%0aJeshimon.%0a%0a21:21 And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites,%0asaying, 21:22 Let me pass through thy land: we will not turn into the%0afields, or into the vineyards; we will not drink of the waters of the%0awell: but we will go along by the king's high way, until we be past%0athy borders.%0a%0a21:23 And Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border:%0abut Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out against%0aIsrael into the wilderness: and he came to Jahaz, and fought against%0aIsrael.%0a%0a21:24 And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and possessed%0ahis land from Arnon unto Jabbok, even unto the children of Ammon: for%0athe border of the children of Ammon was strong.%0a%0a21:25 And Israel took all these cities: and Israel dwelt in all the%0acities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all the villages thereof.%0a%0a21:26 For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who%0ahad fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out%0aof his hand, even unto Arnon.%0a%0a21:27 Wherefore they that speak in proverbs say, Come into Heshbon,%0alet the city of Sihon be built and prepared: 21:28 For there is a fire%0agone out of Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon: it hath consumed%0aAr of Moab, and the lords of the high places of Arnon.%0a%0a21:29 Woe to thee, Moab! thou art undone, O people of Chemosh: he hath%0agiven his sons that escaped, and his daughters, into captivity unto%0aSihon king of the Amorites.%0a%0a21:30 We have shot at them; Heshbon is perished even unto Dibon, and%0awe have laid them waste even unto Nophah, which reacheth unto Medeba.%0a%0a21:31 Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites.%0a%0a21:32 And Moses sent to spy out Jaazer, and they took the villages%0athereof, and drove out the Amorites that were there.%0a%0a21:33 And they turned and went up by the way of Bashan: and Og the%0aking of Bashan went out against them, he, and all his people, to the%0abattle at Edrei.%0a%0a21:34 And the LORD said unto Moses, Fear him not: for I have delivered%0ahim into thy hand, and all his people, and his land; and thou shalt do%0ato him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at%0aHeshbon.%0a%0a21:35 So they smote him, and his sons, and all his people, until there%0awas none left him alive: and they possessed his land.%0a%0a22:1 And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in the plains%0aof Moab on this side Jordan by Jericho.%0a%0a22:2 And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the%0aAmorites.%0a%0a22:3 And Moab was sore afraid of the people, because they were many:%0aand Moab was distressed because of the children of Israel.%0a%0a22:4 And Moab said unto the elders of Midian, Now shall this company%0alick up all that are round about us, as the ox licketh up the grass of%0athe field.%0a%0aAnd Balak the son of Zippor was king of the Moabites at that time.%0a%0a22:5 He sent messengers therefore unto Balaam the son of Beor to%0aPethor, which is by the river of the land of the children of his%0apeople, to call him, saying, Behold, there is a people come out from%0aEgypt: behold, they cover the face of the earth, and they abide over%0aagainst me: 22:6 Come now therefore, I pray thee, curse me this%0apeople; for they are too mighty for me: peradventure I shall prevail,%0athat we may smite them, and that I may drive them out of the land: for%0aI wot that he whom thou blessest is blessed, and he whom thou cursest%0ais cursed.%0a%0a22:7 And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the%0arewards of divination in their hand; and they came unto Balaam, and%0aspake unto him the words of Balak.%0a%0a22:8 And he said unto them, Lodge here this night, and I will bring%0ayou word again, as the LORD shall speak unto me: and the princes of%0aMoab abode with Balaam.%0a%0a22:9 And God came unto Balaam, and said, What men are these with thee?%0a22:10 And Balaam said unto God, Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab,%0ahath sent unto me, saying, 22:11 Behold, there is a people come out of%0aEgypt, which covereth the face of the earth: come now, curse me them;%0aperadventure I shall be able to overcome them, and drive them out.%0a%0a22:12 And God said unto Balaam, Thou shalt not go with them; thou%0ashalt not curse the people: for they are blessed.%0a%0a22:13 And Balaam rose up in the morning, and said unto the princes of%0aBalak, Get you into your land: for the LORD refuseth to give me leave%0ato go with you.%0a%0a22:14 And the princes of Moab rose up, and they went unto Balak, and%0asaid, Balaam refuseth to come with us.%0a%0a22:15 And Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honourable than%0athey.%0a%0a22:16 And they came to Balaam, and said to him, Thus saith Balak the%0ason of Zippor, Let nothing, I pray thee, hinder thee from coming unto%0ame: 22:17 For I will promote thee unto very great honour, and I will%0ado whatsoever thou sayest unto me: come therefore, I pray thee, curse%0ame this people.%0a%0a22:18 And Balaam answered and said unto the servants of Balak, If%0aBalak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go%0abeyond the word of the LORD my God, to do less or more.%0a%0a22:19 Now therefore, I pray you, tarry ye also here this night, that I%0amay know what the LORD will say unto me more.%0a%0a22:20 And God came unto Balaam at night, and said unto him, If the men%0acome to call thee, rise up, and go with them; but yet the word which I%0ashall say unto thee, that shalt thou do.%0a%0a22:21 And Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and went%0awith the princes of Moab.%0a%0a22:22 And God's anger was kindled because he went: and the angel of%0athe LORD stood in the way for an adversary against him. Now he was%0ariding upon his ass, and his two servants were with him.%0a%0a22:23 And the ass saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and%0ahis sword drawn in his hand: and the ass turned aside out of the way,%0aand went into the field: and Balaam smote the ass, to turn her into%0athe way.%0a%0a22:24 But the angel of the LORD stood in a path of the vineyards, a%0awall being on this side, and a wall on that side.%0a%0a22:25 And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she thrust herself%0aunto the wall, and crushed Balaam's foot against the wall: and he%0asmote her again.%0a%0a22:26 And the angel of the LORD went further, and stood in a narrow%0aplace, where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the%0aleft.%0a%0a22:27 And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she fell down under%0aBalaam: and Balaam's anger was kindled, and he smote the ass with a%0astaff.%0a%0a22:28 And the LORD opened the mouth of the ass, and she said unto%0aBalaam, What have I done unto thee, that thou hast smitten me these%0athree times?  22:29 And Balaam said unto the ass, Because thou hast%0amocked me: I would there were a sword in mine hand, for now would I%0akill thee.%0a%0a22:30 And the ass said unto Balaam, Am not I thine ass, upon which%0athou hast ridden ever since I was thine unto this day? was I ever wont%0ato do so unto thee? And he said, Nay.%0a%0a22:31 Then the LORD opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of%0athe LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and he%0abowed down his head, and fell flat on his face.%0a%0a22:32 And the angel of the LORD said unto him, Wherefore hast thou%0asmitten thine ass these three times? behold, I went out to withstand%0athee, because thy way is perverse before me: 22:33 And the ass saw me,%0aand turned from me these three times: unless she had turned from me,%0asurely now also I had slain thee, and saved her alive.%0a%0a22:34 And Balaam said unto the angel of the LORD, I have sinned; for I%0aknew not that thou stoodest in the way against me: now therefore, if%0ait displease thee, I will get me back again.%0a%0a22:35 And the angel of the LORD said unto Balaam, Go with the men: but%0aonly the word that I shall speak unto thee, that thou shalt speak. So%0aBalaam went with the princes of Balak.%0a%0a22:36 And when Balak heard that Balaam was come, he went out to meet%0ahim unto a city of Moab, which is in the border of Arnon, which is in%0athe utmost coast.%0a%0a22:37 And Balak said unto Balaam, Did I not earnestly send unto thee%0ato call thee? wherefore camest thou not unto me? am I not able indeed%0ato promote thee to honour?  22:38 And Balaam said unto Balak, Lo, I am%0acome unto thee: have I now any power at all to say any thing? the word%0athat God putteth in my mouth, that shall I speak.%0a%0a22:39 And Balaam went with Balak, and they came unto Kirjathhuzoth.%0a%0a22:40 And Balak offered oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the%0aprinces that were with him.%0a%0a22:41 And it came to pass on the morrow, that Balak took Balaam, and%0abrought him up into the high places of Baal, that thence he might see%0athe utmost part of the people.%0a%0a23:1 And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and%0aprepare me here seven oxen and seven rams.%0a%0a23:2 And Balak did as Balaam had spoken; and Balak and Balaam offered%0aon every altar a bullock and a ram.%0a%0a23:3 And Balaam said unto Balak, Stand by thy burnt offering, and I%0awill go: peradventure the LORD will come to meet me: and whatsoever he%0asheweth me I will tell thee.

only to the family of the tribe of their father shall they%0amarry.%0a%0a36:7 So shall not the inheritance of the children of Israel remove%0afrom tribe to tribe: for every one of the children of Israel shall%0akeep himself to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers.%0a%0a36:8 And every daughter, that possesseth an inheritance in any tribe%0aof the children of Israel, shall be wife unto one of the family of the%0atribe of her father, that the children of Israel may enjoy every man%0athe inheritance of his fathers.%0a%0a36:9 Neither shall the inheritance remove from one tribe to another%0atribe; but every one of the tribes of the children of Israel shall%0akeep himself to his own inheritance.%0a%0a36:10 Even as the LORD commanded Moses, so did the daughters of%0aZelophehad: 36:11 For Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and%0aNoah, the daughters of Zelophehad, were married unto their father's%0abrothers' sons: 36:12 And they were married into the families of the%0asons of Manasseh the son of Joseph, and their inheritance remained in%0athe tribe of the family of their father.%0a%0a36:13 These are the commandments and the judgments, which the LORD%0acommanded by the hand of Moses unto the children of Israel in the%0aplains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho.

5:22 And this water that causeth the curse shall go into thy%0a%3c bowels, to make thy belly to swell, and thy thigh to rot: And the%0a%3c woman shall say, Amen, amen.%0a%3c %0a%3c 5:23 And the priest shall write these curses in a book, and he shall%0a%3c blot them out with the bitter water: 5:24 And he shall cause the woman%0a%3c to drink the bitter water that causeth the curse: and the water that%0a%3c causeth the curse shall enter into her, and become bitter.%0a%3c %0a%3c 5:25 Then the priest shall take the jealousy offering out of the%0a%3c woman's hand, and shall wave the offering before the LORD, and offer%0a%3c it upon the altar: 5:26 And the priest shall take an handful of the%0a%3c offering, even the memorial thereof, and burn it upon the altar, and%0a%3c afterward shall cause the woman to drink the water.%0a%3c %0a%3c 5:27 And when he hath made her to drink the water, then it shall come%0a%3c to pass, that, if she be defiled, and have done trespass against her%0a%3c husband, that the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her,%0a%3c and become bitter, and her belly shall swell, and her thigh shall rot:%0a%3c and the woman shall be a curse among her people.%0a%3c %0a%3c 5:28 And if the woman be not defiled, but be clean;

Thus shalt%0a%3c thou do unto the Levites touching their charge.%0a%3c %0a%3c 9:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the%0a%3c first month of the second year after they were come out of the land of%0a%3c Egypt, saying, 9:2 Let the children of Israel also keep the passover%0a%3c at his appointed season.%0a%3c %0a%3c 9:3 In the fourteenth day of this month, at even, ye shall keep it in%0a%3c his appointed season: according to all the rites of it, and according%0a%3c to all the ceremonies thereof, shall ye keep it.%0a%3c %0a%3c 9:4 And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, that they should keep%0a%3c the passover.%0a%3c %0a%3c 9:5 And they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the first%0a%3c month at even in the wilderness of Sinai: according to all that the%0a%3c LORD commanded Moses, so did the children of Israel.%0a%3c %0a%3c 9:6 And there were certain men, who were defiled by the dead body of a%0a%3c man, that they could not keep the passover on that day: and they came%0a%3c before Moses and before Aaron on that day: 9:7 And those men said unto%0a%3c him, We are defiled by the dead body of a man: wherefore are we kept%0a%3c back, that we may not offer an offering of the LORD in his appointed%0a%3c season among the children of Israel?  9:8 And Moses said unto them,%0a%3c Stand still, and I will hear what the LORD will command concerning%0a%3c you.%0a%3c %0a%3c 9:9 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 9:10 Speak unto the%0a%3c children of Israel, saying, If any man of you or of your posterity%0a%3c shall be unclean by reason of a dead body, or be in a journey afar%0a%3c off, yet he shall keep the passover unto the LORD.%0a%3c %0a%3c 9:11 The fourteenth day of the second month at even they shall keep%0a%3c it, and eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.%0a%3c %0a%3c 9:12 They shall leave none of it unto the morning, nor break any bone%0a%3c of it: according to all the ordinances of the passover they shall keep%0a%3c it.%0a%3c %0a%3c 9:13 But the man that is clean, and is not in a journey, and%0a%3c forbeareth to keep the passover, even the same soul shall be cut off%0a%3c from among his people: because he brought not the offering of the LORD%0a%3c in his appointed season, that man shall bear his sin.%0a%3c %0a%3c 9:14 And if a stranger shall sojourn among you, and will keep the%0a%3c passover unto the LORD; according to the ordinance of the passover,%0a%3c and according to the manner thereof, so shall he do: ye shall have one%0a%3c ordinance, both for the stranger, and for him that was born in the%0a%3c land.%0a%3c %0a%3c 9:15 And on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud%0a%3c covered the tabernacle, namely, the tent of the testimony: and at even%0a%3c there was upon the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire, until%0a%3c the morning.%0a%3c %0a%3c 9:16 So it was alway: the cloud covered it by day, and the appearance%0a%3c of fire by night.%0a%3c %0a%3c 9:17 And when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle, then after%0a%3c that the children of Israel journeyed: and in the place where the%0a%3c cloud abode, there the children of Israel pitched their tents.%0a%3c %0a%3c 9:18 At the commandment of the LORD the children of Israel journeyed,%0a%3c and at the commandment of the LORD they pitched: as long as the cloud%0a%3c abode upon the tabernacle they rested in their tents.%0a%3c %0a%3c 9:19 And when the cloud tarried long upon the tabernacle many days,%0a%3c then the children of Israel kept the charge of the LORD, and journeyed%0a%3c not.%0a%3c %0a%3c 9:20 And so it was, when the cloud was a few days upon the tabernacle;%0a%3c according to the commandment of the LORD they abode in their tents,%0a%3c and according to the commandment of the LORD they journeyed.%0a%3c %0a%3c 9:21 And so it was, when the cloud abode from even unto the morning,%0a%3c and that the cloud was taken up in the morning, then they journeyed:%0a%3c whether it was by day or by night that the cloud was taken up, they%0a%3c journeyed.%0a%3c %0a%3c 9:22 Or whether it were two days, or a month, or a year, that the%0a%3c cloud tarried upon the tabernacle, remaining thereon, the children of%0a%3c Israel abode in their tents, and journeyed not: but when it was taken%0a%3c up, they journeyed.%0a%3c %0a%3c 9:23 At the commandment of the LORD they rested in the tents, and at%0a%3c the commandment of the LORD they journeyed: they kept the charge of%0a%3c the LORD, at the commandment of the LORD by the hand of Moses.%0a%3c %0a%3c 10:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 10:2 Make thee two%0a%3c trumpets of silver; of a whole piece shalt thou make them: that thou%0a%3c mayest use them for the calling of the assembly, and for the%0a%3c journeying of the camps.%0a%3c %0a%3c 10:3 And when they shall blow with them, all the assembly shall%0a%3c assemble themselves to thee at the door of the tabernacle of the%0a%3c congregation.%0a%3c %0a%3c 10:4 And if they blow but with one trumpet, then the princes, which%0a%3c are heads of the thousands of Israel, shall gather themselves unto%0a%3c thee.%0a%3c %0a%3c 10:5 When ye blow an alarm, then the camps that lie on the east parts%0a%3c shall go forward.%0a%3c %0a%3c 10:6 When ye blow an alarm the second time, then the camps that lie on%0a%3c the south side shall take their journey: they shall blow an alarm for%0a%3c their journeys.%0a%3c %0a%3c 10:7 But when the congregation is to be gathered together, ye shall%0a%3c blow, but ye shall not sound an alarm.%0a%3c %0a%3c 10:8 And the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow with the trumpets;%0a%3c and they shall be to you for an ordinance for ever throughout your%0a%3c generations.%0a%3c %0a%3c 10:9 And if ye go to war in your land against the enemy that%0a%3c oppresseth you, then ye shall blow an alarm with the trumpets; and ye%0a%3c shall be remembered before the LORD your God, and ye shall be saved%0a%3c from your enemies.%0a%3c %0a%3c 10:10 Also in the day of your gladness, and in your solemn days, and%0a%3c in the beginnings of your months, ye shall blow with the trumpets over%0a%3c your burnt offerings, and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings;%0a%3c that they may be to you for a memorial before your God: I am the LORD%0a%3c your God.%0a%3c %0a%3c 10:11 And it came to pass on the twentieth day of the second month, in%0a%3c the second year, that the cloud was taken up from off the tabernacle%0a%3c of the testimony.%0a%3c %0a%3c 10:12 And the children of Israel took their journeys out of the%0a%3c wilderness of Sinai; and the cloud rested in the wilderness of Paran.%0a%3c %0a%3c 10:13 And they first took their journey according to the commandment%0a%3c of the LORD by the hand of Moses.%0a%3c %0a%3c 10:14 In the first place went the standard of the camp of the children%0a%3c of Judah according to their armies: and over his host was Nahshon the%0a%3c son of Amminadab.%0a%3c %0a%3c 10:15 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Issachar was%0a%3c Nethaneel the son of Zuar.%0a%3c %0a%3c 10:16 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Zebulun was%0a%3c Eliab the son of Helon.%0a%3c %0a%3c 10:17 And the tabernacle was taken down; and the sons of Gershon and%0a%3c the sons of Merari set forward, bearing the tabernacle.%0a%3c %0a%3c 10:18 And the standard of the camp of Reuben set forward according to%0a%3c their armies: and over his host was Elizur the son of Shedeur.%0a%3c %0a%3c 10:19 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Simeon was%0a%3c Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai.%0a%3c %0a%3c 10:20 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Gad was%0a%3c Eliasaph the son of Deuel.%0a%3c %0a%3c 10:21 And the Kohathites set forward, bearing the sanctuary: and the%0a%3c other did set up the tabernacle against they came.%0a%3c %0a%3c 10:22 And the standard of the camp of the children of Ephraim set%0a%3c forward according to their armies: and over his host was Elishama the%0a%3c son of Ammihud.%0a%3c %0a%3c 10:23 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Manasseh was%0a%3c Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur.%0a%3c %0a%3c 10:24 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Benjamin was%0a%3c Abidan the son of Gideoni.%0a%3c %0a%3c 10:25 And the standard of the camp of the children of Dan set forward,%0a%3c which was the rereward of all the camps throughout their hosts: and%0a%3c over his host was Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai.%0a%3c %0a%3c 10:26 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Asher was%0a%3c Pagiel the son of Ocran.%0a%3c %0a%3c 10:27 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Naphtali was%0a%3c Ahira the son of Enan.%0a%3c %0a%3c 10:28 Thus were the journeyings of the children of Israel according to%0a%3c their armies, when they set forward.%0a%3c %0a%3c 10:29 And Moses said unto Hobab, the son of Raguel the Midianite,%0a%3c Moses' father in law, We are journeying unto the place of which the%0a%3c LORD said, I will give it you: come thou with us, and we will do thee%0a%3c good: for the LORD hath spoken good concerning Israel.%0a%3c %0a%3c 10:30 And he said unto him, I will not go; but I will depart to mine%0a%3c own land, and to my kindred.%0a%3c %0a%3c 10:31 And he said, Leave us not, I pray thee; forasmuch as thou%0a%3c knowest how we are to encamp in the wilderness, and thou mayest be to%0a%3c us instead of eyes.%0a%3c %0a%3c 10:32 And it shall be, if thou go with us, yea, it shall be, that what%0a%3c goodness the LORD shall do unto us, the same will we do unto thee.%0a%3c %0a%3c 10:33 And they departed from the mount of the LORD three days'%0a%3c journey: and the ark of the covenant of the LORD went before them in%0a%3c the three days' journey, to search out a resting place for them.%0a%3c %0a%3c 10:34 And the cloud of the LORD was upon them by day, when they went%0a%3c out of the camp.%0a%3c %0a%3c 10:35 And it came to pass, when the ark set forward, that Moses said,%0a%3c Rise up, LORD, and let thine enemies be scattered; and let them that%0a%3c hate thee flee before thee.%0a%3c %0a%3c 10:36 And when it rested, he said, Return, O LORD, unto the many%0a%3c thousands of Israel.%0a%3c %0a%3c 11:1 And when the people complained, it displeased the LORD: and the%0a%3c LORD heard it; and his anger was kindled; and the fire of the LORD%0a%3c burnt among them, and consumed them that were in the uttermost parts%0a%3c of the camp.%0a%3c %0a%3c 11:2 And the people cried unto Moses; and when Moses prayed unto the%0a%3c LORD, the fire was quenched.%0a%3c %0a%3c 11:3 And he called the name of the place Taberah: because the fire of%0a%3c the LORD burnt among them.%0a%3c %0a%3c 11:4 And the mixt multitude that was among them fell a lusting: and%0a%3c the children of Israel also wept again, and said, Who shall give us%0a%3c flesh to eat?  11:5 We remember the fish, which we did eat in Egypt%0a%3c freely; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions,%0a%3c and the garlick: 11:6 But now our soul is dried away: there is nothing%0a%3c at all, beside this manna, before our eyes.%0a%3c %0a%3c 11:7 And the manna was as coriander seed, and the colour thereof as%0a%3c the colour of bdellium.%0a%3c %0a%3c 11:8 And the people went about, and gathered it, and ground it in%0a%3c mills, or beat it in a mortar, and baked it in pans, and made cakes of%0a%3c it: and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil.%0a%3c %0a%3c 11:9 And when the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell%0a%3c upon it.%0a%3c %0a%3c 11:10 Then Moses heard the people weep throughout their families,%0a%3c every man in the door of his tent: and the anger of the LORD was%0a%3c kindled greatly; Moses also was displeased.%0a%3c %0a%3c 11:11 And Moses said unto the LORD, Wherefore hast thou afflicted thy%0a%3c servant? and wherefore have I not found favour in thy sight, that thou%0a%3c layest the burden of all this people upon me?  11:12 Have I conceived%0a%3c all this people? have I begotten them, that thou shouldest say unto%0a%3c me, Carry them in thy bosom, as a nursing father beareth the sucking%0a%3c child, unto the land which thou swarest unto their fathers?  11:13%0a%3c Whence should I have flesh to give unto all this people? for they weep%0a%3c unto me, saying, Give us flesh, that we may eat.%0a%3c %0a%3c 11:14 I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is too%0a%3c heavy for me.%0a%3c %0a%3c 11:15 And if thou deal thus with me, kill me, I pray thee, out of%0a%3c hand, if I have found favour in thy sight; and let me not see my%0a%3c wretchedness.%0a%3c %0a%3c 11:16 And the LORD said unto Moses, Gather unto me seventy men of the%0a%3c elders of Israel, whom thou knowest to be the elders of the people,%0a%3c and officers over them; and bring them unto the tabernacle of the%0a%3c congregation, that they may stand there with thee.%0a%3c %0a%3c 11:17 And I will come down and talk with thee there: and I will take%0a%3c of the spirit which is upon thee, and will put it upon them; and they%0a%3c shall bear the burden of the people with thee, that thou bear it not%0a%3c thyself alone.%0a%3c %0a%3c 11:18 And say thou unto the people, Sanctify yourselves against to%0a%3c morrow, and ye shall eat flesh: for ye have wept in the ears of the%0a%3c LORD, saying, Who shall give us flesh to eat? for it was well with us%0a%3c in Egypt: therefore the LORD will give you flesh, and ye shall eat.%0a%3c %0a%3c 11:19 Ye shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither%0a%3c ten days, nor twenty days; 11:20 But even a whole month, until it come%0a%3c out at your nostrils, and it be loathsome unto you: because that ye%0a%3c have despised the LORD which is among you, and have wept before him,%0a%3c saying, Why came we forth out of Egypt?  11:21 And Moses said, The%0a%3c people, among whom I am, are six hundred thousand footmen; and thou%0a%3c hast said, I will give them flesh, that they may eat a whole month.%0a%3c %0a%3c 11:22 Shall the flocks and the herds be slain for them, to suffice%0a%3c them?  or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them,%0a%3c to suffice them?  11:23 And the LORD said unto Moses, Is the LORD's%0a%3c hand waxed short? thou shalt see now whether my word shall come to%0a%3c pass unto thee or not.%0a%3c %0a%3c 11:24 And Moses went out, and told the people the words of the LORD,%0a%3c and gathered the seventy men of the elders of the people, and set them%0a%3c round about the tabernacle.%0a%3c %0a%3c 11:25 And the LORD came down in a cloud, and spake unto him, and took%0a%3c of the spirit that was upon him, and gave it unto the seventy elders:%0a%3c and it came to pass, that, when the spirit rested upon them, they%0a%3c prophesied, and did not cease.%0a%3c %0a%3c 11:26 But there remained two of the men in the camp, the name of the%0a%3c one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad: and the spirit rested%0a%3c upon them; and they were of them that were written, but went not out%0a%3c unto the tabernacle: and they prophesied in the camp.%0a%3c %0a%3c 11:27 And there ran a young man, and told Moses, and said, Eldad and%0a%3c Medad do prophesy in the camp.%0a%3c %0a%3c 11:28 And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Moses, one of his%0a%3c young men, answered and said, My lord Moses, forbid them.%0a%3c %0a%3c 11:29 And Moses said unto him, Enviest thou for my sake? would God%0a%3c that all the LORD's people were prophets, and that the LORD would put%0a%3c his spirit upon them!  11:30 And Moses gat him into the camp, he and%0a%3c the elders of Israel.%0a%3c %0a%3c 11:31 And there went forth a wind from the LORD, and brought quails%0a%3c from the sea, and let them fall by the camp, as it were a day's%0a%3c journey on this side, and as it were a day's journey on the other%0a%3c side, round about the camp, and as it were two cubits high upon the%0a%3c face of the earth.%0a%3c %0a%3c 11:32 And the people stood up all that day, and all that night, and%0a%3c all the next day, and they gathered the quails: he that gathered least%0a%3c gathered ten homers: and they spread them all abroad for themselves%0a%3c round about the camp.%0a%3c %0a%3c 11:33 And while the flesh was yet between their teeth, ere it was%0a%3c chewed, the wrath of the LORD was kindled against the people, and the%0a%3c LORD smote the people with a very great plague.%0a%3c %0a%3c 11:34 And he called the name of that place Kibrothhattaavah: because%0a%3c there they buried the people that lusted.%0a%3c %0a%3c 11:35 And the people journeyed from Kibrothhattaavah unto Hazeroth;%0a%3c and abode at Hazeroth.%0a%3c %0a%3c 12:1 And Miriam and Aaron spake against Moses because of the Ethiopian%0a%3c woman whom he had married: for he had married an Ethiopian woman.%0a%3c %0a%3c 12:2 And they said, Hath the LORD indeed spoken only by Moses? hath he%0a%3c not spoken also by us? And the LORD heard it.%0a%3c %0a%3c 12:3 (Now the man Moses was very meek, above all the men which were%0a%3c upon the face of the earth.)  12:4 And the LORD spake suddenly unto%0a%3c Moses, and unto Aaron, and unto Miriam, Come out ye three unto the%0a%3c tabernacle of the congregation. And they three came out.%0a%3c %0a%3c 12:5 And the LORD came down in the pillar of the cloud, and stood in%0a%3c the door of the tabernacle, and called Aaron and Miriam: and they both%0a%3c came forth.%0a%3c %0a%3c 12:6 And he said, Hear now my words: If there be a prophet among you,%0a%3c I the LORD will make myself known unto him in a vision, and will speak%0a%3c unto him in a dream.%0a%3c %0a%3c 12:7 My servant Moses is not so, who is faithful in all mine house.%0a%3c %0a%3c 12:8 With him will I speak mouth to mouth, even apparently, and not in%0a%3c dark speeches; and the similitude of the LORD shall he behold:%0a%3c wherefore then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant Moses?%0a%3c 12:9 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against them; and he%0a%3c departed.%0a%3c %0a%3c 12:10 And the cloud departed from off the tabernacle; and, behold,%0a%3c Miriam became leprous, white as snow: and Aaron looked upon Miriam,%0a%3c and, behold, she was leprous.%0a%3c %0a%3c 12:11 And Aaron said unto Moses, Alas, my lord, I beseech thee, lay%0a%3c not the sin upon us, wherein we have done foolishly, and wherein we%0a%3c have sinned.%0a%3c %0a%3c 12:12 Let her not be as one dead, of whom the flesh is half consumed%0a%3c when he cometh out of his mother's womb.%0a%3c %0a%3c 12:13 And Moses cried unto the LORD, saying, Heal her now, O God, I%0a%3c beseech thee.%0a%3c %0a%3c 12:14 And the LORD said unto Moses, If her father had but spit in her%0a%3c face, should she not be ashamed seven days? let her be shut out from%0a%3c the camp seven days, and after that let her be received in again.%0a%3c %0a%3c 12:15 And Miriam was shut out from the camp seven days: and the people%0a%3c journeyed not till Miriam was brought in again.%0a%3c %0a%3c 12:16 And afterward the people removed from Hazeroth, and pitched in%0a%3c the wilderness of Paran.%0a%3c %0a%3c 13:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 13:2 Send thou men, that%0a%3c they may search the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of%0a%3c Israel: of every tribe of their fathers shall ye send a man, every one%0a%3c a ruler among them.%0a%3c %0a%3c 13:3 And Moses by the commandment of the LORD sent them from the%0a%3c wilderness of Paran: all those men were heads of the children of%0a%3c Israel.%0a%3c %0a%3c 13:4 And these were their names: of the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the%0a%3c son of Zaccur.%0a%3c %0a%3c 13:5 Of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori.%0a%3c %0a%3c 13:6 Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh.%0a%3c %0a%3c 13:7 Of the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph.%0a%3c %0a%3c 13:8 Of the tribe of Ephraim, Oshea the son of Nun.%0a%3c %0a%3c 13:9 Of the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu.%0a%3c %0a%3c 13:10 Of the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi.%0a%3c %0a%3c 13:11 Of the tribe of Joseph, namely, of the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi%0a%3c the son of Susi.%0a%3c %0a%3c 13:12 Of the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli.%0a%3c %0a%3c 13:13 Of the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael.%0a%3c %0a%3c 13:14 Of the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi.%0a%3c %0a%3c 13:15 Of the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi.%0a%3c %0a%3c 13:16 These are the names of the men which Moses sent to spy out the%0a%3c land.%0a%3c %0a%3c And Moses called Oshea the son of Nun Jehoshua.%0a%3c %0a%3c 13:17 And Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said unto%0a%3c them, Get you up this way southward, and go up into the mountain:%0a%3c 13:18 And see the land, what it is, and the people that dwelleth%0a%3c therein, whether they be strong or weak, few or many; 13:19 And what%0a%3c the land is that they dwell in, whether it be good or bad; and what%0a%3c cities they be that they dwell in, whether in tents, or in strong%0a%3c holds; 13:20 And what the land is, whether it be fat or lean, whether%0a%3c there be wood therein, or not. And be ye of good courage, and bring of%0a%3c the fruit of the land. Now the time was the time of the firstripe%0a%3c grapes.%0a%3c %0a%3c 13:21 So they went up, and searched the land from the wilderness of%0a%3c Zin unto Rehob, as men come to Hamath.%0a%3c %0a%3c 13:22 And they ascended by the south, and came unto Hebron; where%0a%3c Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, were. (Now Hebron%0a%3c was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)  13:23 And they came unto%0a%3c the brook of Eshcol, and cut down from thence a branch with one%0a%3c cluster of grapes, and they bare it between two upon a staff; and they%0a%3c brought of the pomegranates, and of the figs.%0a%3c %0a%3c 13:24 The place was called the brook Eshcol, because of the cluster of%0a%3c grapes which the children of Israel cut down from thence.%0a%3c %0a%3c 13:25 And they returned from searching of the land after forty days.%0a%3c %0a%3c 13:26 And they went and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the%0a%3c congregation of the children of Israel, unto the wilderness of Paran,%0a%3c to Kadesh; and brought back word unto them, and unto all the%0a%3c congregation, and shewed them the fruit of the land.%0a%3c %0a%3c 13:27 And they told him, and said, We came unto the land whither thou%0a%3c sentest us, and surely it floweth with milk and honey; and this is the%0a%3c fruit of it.%0a%3c %0a%3c 13:28 Nevertheless the people be strong that dwell in the land, and%0a%3c the cities are walled, and very great: and moreover we saw the%0a%3c children of Anak there.%0a%3c %0a%3c 13:29 The Amalekites dwell in the land of the south: and the Hittites,%0a%3c and the Jebusites, and the Amorites, dwell in the mountains: and the%0a%3c Canaanites dwell by the sea, and by the coast of Jordan.%0a%3c %0a%3c 13:30 And Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, Let us go%0a%3c up at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it.%0a%3c %0a%3c 13:31 But the men that went up with him said, We be not able to go up%0a%3c against the people; for they are stronger than we.%0a%3c %0a%3c 13:32 And they brought up an evil report of the land which they had%0a%3c searched unto the children of Israel, saying, The land, through which%0a%3c we have gone to search it, is a land that eateth up the inhabitants%0a%3c thereof; and all the people that we saw in it are men of a great%0a%3c stature.%0a%3c %0a%3c 13:33 And there we saw the giants, the sons of Anak, which come of the%0a%3c giants: and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were%0a%3c in their sight.%0a%3c %0a%3c 14:1 And all the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried; and%0a%3c the people wept that night.%0a%3c %0a%3c 14:2 And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against%0a%3c Aaron: and the whole congregation said unto them, Would God that we%0a%3c had died in the land of Egypt! or would God we had died in this%0a%3c wilderness!  14:3 And wherefore hath the LORD brought us unto this%0a%3c land, to fall by the sword, that our wives and our children should be%0a%3c a prey? were it not better for us to return into Egypt?  14:4 And they%0a%3c said one to another, Let us make a captain, and let us return into%0a%3c Egypt.%0a%3c %0a%3c 14:5 Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly%0a%3c of the congregation of the children of Israel.%0a%3c %0a%3c 14:6 And Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, which%0a%3c were of them that searched the land, rent their clothes: 14:7 And they%0a%3c spake unto all the company of the children of Israel, saying, The%0a%3c land, which we passed through to search it, is an exceeding good land.%0a%3c %0a%3c 14:8 If the LORD delight in us, then he will bring us into this land,%0a%3c and give it us; a land which floweth with milk and honey.%0a%3c %0a%3c 14:9 Only rebel not ye against the LORD, neither fear ye the people of%0a%3c the land; for they are bread for us: their defence is departed from%0a%3c them, and the LORD is with us: fear them not.%0a%3c %0a%3c 14:10 But all the congregation bade stone them with stones. And the%0a%3c glory of the LORD appeared in the tabernacle of the congregation%0a%3c before all the children of Israel.%0a%3c %0a%3c 14:11 And the LORD said unto Moses, How long will this people provoke%0a%3c me?  and how long will it be ere they believe me, for all the signs%0a%3c which I have shewed among them?  14:12 I will smite them with the%0a%3c pestilence, and disinherit them, and will make of thee a greater%0a%3c nation and mightier than they.%0a%3c %0a%3c 14:13 And Moses said unto the LORD, Then the Egyptians shall hear it,%0a%3c (for thou broughtest up this people in thy might from among them;)%0a%3c 14:14 And they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land: for they%0a%3c have heard that thou LORD art among this people, that thou LORD art%0a%3c seen face to face, and that thy cloud standeth over them, and that%0a%3c thou goest before them, by day time in a pillar of a cloud, and in a%0a%3c pillar of fire by night.%0a%3c %0a%3c 14:15 Now if thou shalt kill all this people as one man, then the%0a%3c nations which have heard the fame of thee will speak, saying, 14:16%0a%3c Because the LORD was not able to bring this people into the land which%0a%3c he sware unto them, therefore he hath slain them in the wilderness.%0a%3c %0a%3c 14:17 And now, I beseech thee, let the power of my LORD be great,%0a%3c according as thou hast spoken, saying, 14:18 The LORD is%0a%3c longsuffering, and of great mercy, forgiving iniquity and%0a%3c transgression, and by no means clearing the guilty, visiting the%0a%3c iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth%0a%3c generation.%0a%3c %0a%3c 14:19 Pardon, I beseech thee, the iniquity of this people according%0a%3c unto the greatness of thy mercy, and as thou hast forgiven this%0a%3c people, from Egypt even until now.%0a%3c %0a%3c 14:20 And the LORD said, I have pardoned according to thy word: 14:21%0a%3c But as truly as I live, all the earth shall be filled with the glory%0a%3c of the LORD.%0a%3c %0a%3c 14:22 Because all those men which have seen my glory, and my miracles,%0a%3c which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and have tempted me now%0a%3c these ten times, and have not hearkened to my voice; 14:23 Surely they%0a%3c shall not see the land which I sware unto their fathers, neither shall%0a%3c any of them that provoked me see it: 14:24 But my servant Caleb,%0a%3c because he had another spirit with him, and hath followed me fully,%0a%3c him will I bring into the land whereinto he went; and his seed shall%0a%3c possess it.%0a%3c %0a%3c 14:25 (Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites dwelt in the valley.)%0a%3c Tomorrow turn you, and get you into the wilderness by the way of the%0a%3c Red sea.%0a%3c %0a%3c 14:26 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, 14:27 How%0a%3c long shall I bear with this evil congregation, which murmur against%0a%3c me? I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they%0a%3c murmur against me.%0a%3c %0a%3c 14:28 Say unto them, As truly as I live, saith the LORD, as ye have%0a%3c spoken in mine ears, so will I do to you: 14:29 Your carcases shall%0a%3c fall in this wilderness; and all that were numbered of you, according%0a%3c to your whole number, from twenty years old and upward which have%0a%3c murmured against me.%0a%3c %0a%3c 14:30 Doubtless ye shall not come into the land, concerning which I%0a%3c sware to make you dwell therein, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and%0a%3c Joshua the son of Nun.%0a%3c %0a%3c 14:31 But your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, them will%0a%3c I bring in, and they shall know the land which ye have despised.%0a%3c %0a%3c 14:32 But as for you, your carcases, they shall fall in this%0a%3c wilderness.%0a%3c %0a%3c 14:33 And your children shall wander in the wilderness forty years,%0a%3c and bear your whoredoms, until your carcases be wasted in the%0a%3c wilderness.%0a%3c %0a%3c 14:34 After the number of the days in which ye searched the land, even%0a%3c forty days, each day for a year, shall ye bear your iniquities, even%0a%3c forty years, and ye shall know my breach of promise.%0a%3c %0a%3c 14:35 I the LORD have said, I will surely do it unto all this evil%0a%3c congregation, that are gathered together against me: in this%0a%3c wilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall die.%0a%3c %0a%3c 14:36 And the men, which Moses sent to search the land, who returned,%0a%3c and made all the congregation to murmur against him, by bringing up a%0a%3c slander upon the land, 14:37 Even those men that did bring up the evil%0a%3c report upon the land, died by the plague before the LORD.%0a%3c %0a%3c 14:38 But Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, which%0a%3c were of the men that went to search the land, lived still.%0a%3c %0a%3c 14:39 And Moses told these sayings unto all the children of Israel:%0a%3c and the people mourned greatly.%0a%3c %0a%3c 14:40 And they rose up early in the morning, and gat them up into the%0a%3c top of the mountain, saying, Lo, we be here, and will go up unto the%0a%3c place which the LORD hath promised: for we have sinned.%0a%3c %0a%3c 14:41 And Moses said, Wherefore now do ye transgress the commandment%0a%3c of the LORD? but it shall not prosper.%0a%3c %0a%3c 14:42 Go not up, for the LORD is not among you; that ye be not smitten%0a%3c before your enemies.%0a%3c %0a%3c 14:43 For the Amalekites and the Canaanites are there before you, and%0a%3c ye shall fall by the sword: because ye are turned away from the LORD,%0a%3c therefore the LORD will not be with you.%0a%3c %0a%3c 14:44 But they presumed to go up unto the hill top: nevertheless the%0a%3c ark of the covenant of the LORD, and Moses, departed not out of the%0a%3c camp.%0a%3c %0a%3c 14:45 Then the Amalekites came down, and the Canaanites which dwelt in%0a%3c that hill, and smote them, and discomfited them, even unto Hormah.%0a%3c %0a%3c 15:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 15:2 Speak unto the%0a%3c children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come into the land%0a%3c of your habitations, which I give unto you, 15:3 And will make an%0a%3c offering by fire unto the LORD, a burnt offering, or a sacrifice in%0a%3c performing a vow, or in a freewill offering, or in your solemn feasts,%0a%3c to make a sweet savour unto the LORD, of the herd or of the flock:%0a%3c 15:4 Then shall he that offereth his offering unto the LORD bring a%0a%3c meat offering of a tenth deal of flour mingled with the fourth part of%0a%3c an hin of oil.%0a%3c %0a%3c 15:5 And the fourth part of an hin of wine for a drink offering shalt%0a%3c thou prepare with the burnt offering or sacrifice, for one lamb.%0a%3c %0a%3c 15:6 Or for a ram, thou shalt prepare for a meat offering two tenth%0a%3c deals of flour mingled with the third part of an hin of oil.%0a%3c %0a%3c 15:7 And for a drink offering thou shalt offer the third part of an%0a%3c hin of wine, for a sweet savour unto the LORD.%0a%3c %0a%3c 15:8 And when thou preparest a bullock for a burnt offering, or for a%0a%3c sacrifice in performing a vow, or peace offerings unto the LORD: 15:9%0a%3c Then shall he bring with a bullock a meat offering of three tenth%0a%3c deals of flour mingled with half an hin of oil.%0a%3c %0a%3c 15:10 And thou shalt bring for a drink offering half an hin of wine,%0a%3c for an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.%0a%3c %0a%3c 15:11 Thus shall it be done for one bullock, or for one ram, or for a%0a%3c lamb, or a kid.%0a%3c %0a%3c 15:12 According to the number that ye shall prepare, so shall ye do to%0a%3c every one according to their number.%0a%3c %0a%3c 15:13 All that are born of the country shall do these things after%0a%3c this manner, in offering an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour%0a%3c unto the LORD.%0a%3c %0a%3c 15:14 And if a stranger sojourn with you, or whosoever be among you in%0a%3c your generations, and will offer an offering made by fire, of a sweet%0a%3c savour unto the LORD; as ye do, so he shall do.%0a%3c %0a%3c 15:15 One ordinance shall be both for you of the congregation, and%0a%3c also for the stranger that sojourneth with you, an ordinance for ever%0a%3c in your generations: as ye are, so shall the stranger be before the%0a%3c LORD.%0a%3c %0a%3c 15:16 One law and one manner shall be for you, and for the stranger%0a%3c that sojourneth with you.%0a%3c %0a%3c 15:17 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 15:18 Speak unto the%0a%3c children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land%0a%3c whither I bring you, 15:19 Then it shall be, that, when ye eat of the%0a%3c bread of the land, ye shall offer up an heave offering unto the LORD.%0a%3c %0a%3c 15:20 Ye shall offer up a cake of the first of your dough for an heave%0a%3c offering: as ye do the heave offering of the threshingfloor, so shall%0a%3c ye heave it.%0a%3c %0a%3c 15:21 Of the first of your dough ye shall give unto the LORD an heave%0a%3c offering in your generations.%0a%3c %0a%3c 15:22 And if ye have erred, and not observed all these commandments,%0a%3c which the LORD hath spoken unto Moses, 15:23 Even all that the LORD%0a%3c hath commanded you by the hand of Moses, from the day that the LORD%0a%3c commanded Moses, and henceforward among your generations; 15:24 Then%0a%3c it shall be, if ought be committed by ignorance without the knowledge%0a%3c of the congregation, that all the congregation shall offer one young%0a%3c bullock for a burnt offering, for a sweet savour unto the LORD, with%0a%3c his meat offering, and his drink offering, according to the manner,%0a%3c and one kid of the goats for a sin offering.%0a%3c %0a%3c 15:25 And the priest shall make an atonement for all the congregation%0a%3c of the children of Israel, and it shall be forgiven them; for it is%0a%3c ignorance: and they shall bring their offering, a sacrifice made by%0a%3c fire unto the LORD, and their sin offering before the LORD, for their%0a%3c ignorance: 15:26 And it shall be forgiven all the congregation of the%0a%3c children of Israel, and the stranger that sojourneth among them;%0a%3c seeing all the people were in ignorance.%0a%3c %0a%3c 15:27 And if any soul sin through ignorance, then he shall bring a she%0a%3c goat of the first year for a sin offering.%0a%3c %0a%3c 15:28 And the priest shall make an atonement for the soul that sinneth%0a%3c ignorantly, when he sinneth by ignorance before the LORD, to make an%0a%3c atonement for him; and it shall be forgiven him.%0a%3c %0a%3c 15:29 Ye shall have one law for him that sinneth through ignorance,%0a%3c both for him that is born among the children of Israel, and for the%0a%3c stranger that sojourneth among them.%0a%3c %0a%3c 15:30 But the soul that doeth ought presumptuously, whether he be born%0a%3c in the land, or a stranger, the same reproacheth the LORD; and that%0a%3c soul shall be cut off from among his people.%0a%3c %0a%3c 15:31 Because he hath despised the word of the LORD, and hath broken%0a%3c his commandment, that soul shall utterly be cut off; his iniquity%0a%3c shall be upon him.%0a%3c %0a%3c 15:32 And while the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they%0a%3c found a man that gathered sticks upon the sabbath day.%0a%3c %0a%3c 15:33 And they that found him gathering sticks brought him unto Moses%0a%3c and Aaron, and unto all the congregation.%0a%3c %0a%3c 15:34 And they put him in ward, because it was not declared what%0a%3c should be done to him.%0a%3c %0a%3c 15:35 And the LORD said unto Moses, The man shall be surely put to%0a%3c death: all the congregation shall stone him with stones without the%0a%3c camp.%0a%3c %0a%3c 15:36 And all the congregation brought him without the camp, and%0a%3c stoned him with stones, and he died; as the LORD commanded Moses.%0a%3c %0a%3c 15:37 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 15:38 Speak unto the%0a%3c children of Israel, and bid them that they make them fringes in the%0a%3c borders of their garments throughout their generations, and that they%0a%3c put upon the fringe of the borders a ribband of blue: 15:39 And it%0a%3c shall be unto you for a fringe, that ye may look upon it, and remember%0a%3c all the commandments of the LORD, and do them; and that ye seek not%0a%3c after your own heart and your own eyes, after which ye use to go a%0a%3c whoring: 15:40 That ye may remember, and do all my commandments, and%0a%3c be holy unto your God.%0a%3c %0a%3c 15:41 I am the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of%0a%3c Egypt, to be your God: I am the LORD your God.%0a%3c %0a%3c 16:1 Now Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi,%0a%3c and Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On, the son of Peleth,%0a%3c sons of Reuben, took men: 16:2 And they rose up before Moses, with%0a%3c certain of the children of Israel, two hundred and fifty princes of%0a%3c the assembly, famous in the congregation, men of renown: 16:3 And they%0a%3c gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron, and said%0a%3c unto them, Ye take too much upon you, seeing all the congregation are%0a%3c holy, every one of them, and the LORD is among them: wherefore then%0a%3c lift ye up yourselves above the congregation of the LORD?  16:4 And%0a%3c when Moses heard it, he fell upon his face: 16:5 And he spake unto%0a%3c Korah and unto all his company, saying, Even to morrow the LORD will%0a%3c shew who are his, and who is holy; and will cause him to come near%0a%3c unto him: even him whom he hath chosen will he cause to come near unto%0a%3c him.%0a%3c %0a%3c 16:6 This do; Take you censers, Korah, and all his company; 16:7 And%0a%3c put fire therein, and put incense in them before the LORD to morrow:%0a%3c and it shall be that the man whom the LORD doth choose, he shall be%0a%3c holy: ye take too much upon you, ye sons of Levi.%0a%3c %0a%3c 16:8 And Moses said unto Korah, Hear, I pray you, ye sons of Levi:%0a%3c 16:9 Seemeth it but a small thing unto you, that the God of Israel%0a%3c hath separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near%0a%3c to himself to do the service of the tabernacle of the LORD, and to%0a%3c stand before the congregation to minister unto them?  16:10 And he%0a%3c hath brought thee near to him, and all thy brethren the sons of Levi%0a%3c with thee: and seek ye the priesthood also?  16:11 For which cause%0a%3c both thou and all thy company are gathered together against the LORD:%0a%3c and what is Aaron, that ye murmur against him?  16:12 And Moses sent%0a%3c to call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab: which said, We will not%0a%3c come up: 16:13 Is it a small thing that thou hast brought us up out of%0a%3c a land that floweth with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness,%0a%3c except thou make thyself altogether a prince over us?  16:14 Moreover%0a%3c thou hast not brought us into a land that floweth with milk and honey,%0a%3c or given us inheritance of fields and vineyards: wilt thou put out the%0a%3c eyes of these men? we will not come up.%0a%3c %0a%3c 16:15 And Moses was very wroth, and said unto the LORD, Respect not%0a%3c thou their offering: I have not taken one ass from them, neither have%0a%3c I hurt one of them.%0a%3c %0a%3c 16:16 And Moses said unto Korah, Be thou and all thy company before%0a%3c the LORD, thou, and they, and Aaron, to morrow: 16:17 And take every%0a%3c man his censer, and put incense in them, and bring ye before the LORD%0a%3c every man his censer, two hundred and fifty censers; thou also, and%0a%3c Aaron, each of you his censer.%0a%3c %0a%3c 16:18 And they took every man his censer, and put fire in them, and%0a%3c laid incense thereon, and stood in the door of the tabernacle of the%0a%3c congregation with Moses and Aaron.%0a%3c %0a%3c 16:19 And Korah gathered all the congregation against them unto the%0a%3c door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and the glory of the LORD%0a%3c appeared unto all the congregation.%0a%3c %0a%3c 16:20 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, 16:21%0a%3c Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consume%0a%3c them in a moment.%0a%3c %0a%3c 16:22 And they fell upon their faces, and said, O God, the God of the%0a%3c spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and wilt thou be wroth with%0a%3c all the congregation?  16:23 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,%0a%3c 16:24 Speak unto the congregation, saying, Get you up from about the%0a%3c tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.%0a%3c %0a%3c 16:25 And Moses rose up and went unto Dathan and Abiram; and the%0a%3c elders of Israel followed him.%0a%3c %0a%3c 16:26 And he spake unto the congregation, saying, Depart, I pray you,%0a%3c from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of their's, lest%0a%3c ye be consumed in all their sins.%0a%3c %0a%3c 16:27 So they gat up from the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram,%0a%3c on every side: and Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood in the door%0a%3c of their tents, and their wives, and their sons, and their little%0a%3c children.%0a%3c %0a%3c 16:28 And Moses said, Hereby ye shall know that the LORD hath sent me%0a%3c to do all these works; for I have not done them of mine own mind.%0a%3c %0a%3c 16:29 If these men die the common death of all men, or if they be%0a%3c visited after the visitation of all men; then the LORD hath not sent%0a%3c me.%0a%3c %0a%3c 16:30 But if the LORD make a new thing, and the earth open her mouth,%0a%3c and swallow them up, with all that appertain unto them, and they go%0a%3c down quick into the pit; then ye shall understand that these men have%0a%3c provoked the LORD.%0a%3c %0a%3c 16:31 And it came to pass, as he had made an end of speaking all these%0a%3c words, that the ground clave asunder that was under them: 16:32 And%0a%3c the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their houses,%0a%3c and all the men that appertained unto Korah, and all their goods.%0a%3c %0a%3c 16:33 They, and all that appertained to them, went down alive into the%0a%3c pit, and the earth closed upon them: and they perished from among the%0a%3c congregation.%0a%3c %0a%3c 16:34 And all Israel that were round about them fled at the cry of%0a%3c them: for they said, Lest the earth swallow us up also.%0a%3c %0a%3c 16:35 And there came out a fire from the LORD, and consumed the two%0a%3c hundred and fifty men that offered incense.%0a%3c %0a%3c 16:36 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 16:37 Speak unto Eleazar%0a%3c the son of Aaron the priest, that he take up the censers out of the%0a%3c burning, and scatter thou the fire yonder; for they are hallowed.%0a%3c %0a%3c 16:38 The censers of these sinners against their own souls, let them%0a%3c make them broad plates for a covering of the altar: for they offered%0a%3c them before the LORD, therefore they are hallowed: and they shall be a%0a%3c sign unto the children of Israel.%0a%3c %0a%3c 16:39 And Eleazar the priest took the brasen censers, wherewith they%0a%3c that were burnt had offered; and they were made broad plates for a%0a%3c covering of the altar: 16:40 To be a memorial unto the children of%0a%3c Israel, that no stranger, which is not of the seed of Aaron, come near%0a%3c to offer incense before the LORD; that he be not as Korah, and as his%0a%3c company: as the LORD said to him by the hand of Moses.%0a%3c %0a%3c 16:41 But on the morrow all the congregation of the children of Israel%0a%3c murmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying, Ye have killed the%0a%3c people of the LORD.%0a%3c %0a%3c 16:42 And it came to pass, when the congregation was gathered against%0a%3c Moses and against Aaron, that they looked toward the tabernacle of the%0a%3c congregation: and, behold, the cloud covered it, and the glory of the%0a%3c LORD appeared.%0a%3c %0a%3c 16:43 And Moses and Aaron came before the tabernacle of the%0a%3c congregation.%0a%3c %0a%3c 16:44 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 16:45 Get you up from%0a%3c among this congregation, that I may consume them as in a moment. And%0a%3c they fell upon their faces.%0a%3c %0a%3c 16:46 And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a censer, and put fire therein%0a%3c from off the altar, and put on incense, and go quickly unto the%0a%3c congregation, and make an atonement for them: for there is wrath gone%0a%3c out from the LORD; the plague is begun.%0a%3c %0a%3c 16:47 And Aaron took as Moses commanded, and ran into the midst of the%0a%3c congregation; and, behold, the plague was begun among the people: and%0a%3c he put on incense, and made an atonement for the people.%0a%3c %0a%3c 16:48 And he stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was%0a%3c stayed.%0a%3c %0a%3c 16:49 Now they that died in the plague were fourteen thousand and%0a%3c seven hundred, beside them that died about the matter of Korah.%0a%3c %0a%3c 16:50 And Aaron returned unto Moses unto the door of the tabernacle of%0a%3c the congregation: and the plague was stayed.%0a%3c %0a%3c 17:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 17:2 Speak unto the%0a%3c children of Israel, and take of every one of them a rod according to%0a%3c the house of their fathers, of all their princes according to the%0a%3c house of their fathers twelve rods: write thou every man's name upon%0a%3c his rod.%0a%3c %0a%3c 17:3 And thou shalt write Aaron's name upon the rod of Levi: for one%0a%3c rod shall be for the head of the house of their fathers.%0a%3c %0a%3c 17:4 And thou shalt lay them up in the tabernacle of the congregation%0a%3c before the testimony, where I will meet with you.%0a%3c %0a%3c 17:5 And it shall come to pass, that the man's rod, whom I shall%0a%3c choose, shall blossom: and I will make to cease from me the murmurings%0a%3c of the children of Israel, whereby they murmur against you.%0a%3c %0a%3c 17:6 And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, and every one of%0a%3c their princes gave him a rod apiece, for each prince one, according to%0a%3c their fathers' houses, even twelve rods: and the rod of Aaron was%0a%3c among their rods.%0a%3c %0a%3c 17:7 And Moses laid up the rods before the LORD in the tabernacle of%0a%3c witness.%0a%3c %0a%3c 17:8 And it came to pass, that on the morrow Moses went into the%0a%3c tabernacle of witness; and, behold, the rod of Aaron for the house of%0a%3c Levi was budded, and brought forth buds, and bloomed blossoms, and%0a%3c yielded almonds.%0a%3c %0a%3c 17:9 And Moses brought out all the rods from before the LORD unto all%0a%3c the children of Israel: and they looked, and took every man his rod.%0a%3c %0a%3c 17:10 And the LORD said unto Moses, Bring Aaron's rod again before the%0a%3c testimony, to be kept for a token against the rebels; and thou shalt%0a%3c quite take away their murmurings from me, that they die not.%0a%3c %0a%3c 17:11 And Moses did so: as the LORD commanded him, so did he.%0a%3c %0a%3c 17:12 And the children of Israel spake unto Moses, saying, Behold, we%0a%3c die, we perish, we all perish.%0a%3c %0a%3c 17:13 Whosoever cometh any thing near unto the tabernacle of the LORD%0a%3c shall die: shall we be consumed with dying?  18:1 And the LORD said%0a%3c unto Aaron, Thou and thy sons and thy father's house with thee shall%0a%3c bear the iniquity of the sanctuary: and thou and thy sons with thee%0a%3c shall bear the iniquity of your priesthood.%0a%3c %0a%3c 18:2 And thy brethren also of the tribe of Levi, the tribe of thy%0a%3c father, bring thou with thee, that they may be joined unto thee, and%0a%3c minister unto thee: but thou and thy sons with thee shall minister%0a%3c before the tabernacle of witness.%0a%3c %0a%3c 18:3 And they shall keep thy charge, and the charge of all the%0a%3c tabernacle: only they shall not come nigh the vessels of the sanctuary%0a%3c and the altar, that neither they, nor ye also, die.%0a%3c %0a%3c 18:4 And they shall be joined unto thee, and keep the charge of the%0a%3c tabernacle of the congregation, for all the service of the tabernacle:%0a%3c and a stranger shall not come nigh unto you.%0a%3c %0a%3c 18:5 And ye shall keep the charge of the sanctuary, and the charge of%0a%3c the altar: that there be no wrath any more upon the children of%0a%3c Israel.%0a%3c %0a%3c 18:6 And I, behold, I have taken your brethren the Levites from among%0a%3c the children of Israel: to you they are given as a gift for the LORD,%0a%3c to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation.%0a%3c %0a%3c 18:7 Therefore thou and thy sons with thee shall keep your priest's%0a%3c office for everything of the altar, and within the vail; and ye shall%0a%3c serve: I have given your priest's office unto you as a service of%0a%3c gift: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death.%0a%3c %0a%3c 18:8 And the LORD spake unto Aaron, Behold, I also have given thee the%0a%3c charge of mine heave offerings of all the hallowed things of the%0a%3c children of Israel; unto thee have I given them by reason of the%0a%3c anointing, and to thy sons, by an ordinance for ever.%0a%3c %0a%3c 18:9 This shall be thine of the most holy things, reserved from the%0a%3c fire: every oblation of theirs, every meat offering of theirs, and%0a%3c every sin offering of theirs, and every trespass offering of theirs%0a%3c which they shall render unto me, shall be most holy for thee and for%0a%3c thy sons.%0a%3c %0a%3c 18:10 In the most holy place shalt thou eat it; every male shall eat%0a%3c it: it shall be holy unto thee.%0a%3c %0a%3c 18:11 And this is thine; the heave offering of their gift, with all%0a%3c the wave offerings of the children of Israel: I have given them unto%0a%3c thee, and to thy sons and to thy daughters with thee, by a statute for%0a%3c ever: every one that is clean in thy house shall eat of it.%0a%3c %0a%3c 18:12 All the best of the oil, and all the best of the wine, and of%0a%3c the wheat, the firstfruits of them which they shall offer unto the%0a%3c LORD, them have I given thee.%0a%3c %0a%3c 18:13 And whatsoever is first ripe in the land, which they shall bring%0a%3c unto the LORD, shall be thine; every one that is clean in thine house%0a%3c shall eat of it.%0a%3c %0a%3c 18:14 Every thing devoted in Israel shall be thine.%0a%3c %0a%3c 18:15 Every thing that openeth the matrix in all flesh, which they%0a%3c bring unto the LORD, whether it be of men or beasts, shall be thine:%0a%3c nevertheless the firstborn of man shalt thou surely redeem, and the%0a%3c firstling of unclean beasts shalt thou redeem.%0a%3c %0a%3c 18:16 And those that are to be redeemed from a month old shalt thou%0a%3c redeem, according to thine estimation, for the money of five shekels,%0a%3c after the shekel of the sanctuary, which is twenty gerahs.%0a%3c %0a%3c 18:17 But the firstling of a cow, or the firstling of a sheep, or the%0a%3c firstling of a goat, thou shalt not redeem; they are holy: thou shalt%0a%3c sprinkle their blood upon the altar, and shalt burn their fat for an%0a%3c offering made by fire, for a sweet savour unto the LORD.%0a%3c %0a%3c 18:18 And the flesh of them shall be thine, as the wave breast and as%0a%3c the right shoulder are thine.%0a%3c %0a%3c 18:19 All the heave offerings of the holy things, which the children%0a%3c of Israel offer unto the LORD, have I given thee, and thy sons and thy%0a%3c daughters with thee, by a statute for ever: it is a covenant of salt%0a%3c for ever before the LORD unto thee and to thy seed with thee.%0a%3c %0a%3c 18:20 And the LORD spake unto Aaron, Thou shalt have no inheritance in%0a%3c their land, neither shalt thou have any part among them: I am thy part%0a%3c and thine inheritance among the children of Israel.%0a%3c %0a%3c 18:21 And, behold, I have given the children of Levi all the tenth in%0a%3c Israel for an inheritance, for their service which they serve, even%0a%3c the service of the tabernacle of the congregation.%0a%3c %0a%3c 18:22 Neither must the children of Israel henceforth come nigh the%0a%3c tabernacle of the congregation, lest they bear sin, and die.%0a%3c %0a%3c 18:23 But the Levites shall do the service of the tabernacle of the%0a%3c congregation, and they shall bear their iniquity: it shall be a%0a%3c statute for ever throughout your generations, that among the children%0a%3c of Israel they have no inheritance.%0a%3c %0a%3c 18:24 But the tithes of the children of Israel, which they offer as an%0a%3c heave offering unto the LORD, I have given to the Levites to inherit:%0a%3c therefore I have said unto them, Among the children of Israel they%0a%3c shall have no inheritance.%0a%3c %0a%3c 18:25 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 18:26 Thus speak unto the%0a%3c Levites, and say unto them, When ye take of the children of Israel the%0a%3c tithes which I have given you from them for your inheritance, then ye%0a%3c shall offer up an heave offering of it for the LORD, even a tenth part%0a%3c of the tithe.%0a%3c %0a%3c 18:27 And this your heave offering shall be reckoned unto you, as%0a%3c though it were the corn of the threshingfloor, and as the fulness of%0a%3c the winepress.%0a%3c %0a%3c 18:28 Thus ye also shall offer an heave offering unto the LORD of all%0a%3c your tithes, which ye receive of the children of Israel; and ye shall%0a%3c give thereof the LORD's heave offering to Aaron the priest.%0a%3c %0a%3c 18:29 Out of all your gifts ye shall offer every heave offering of the%0a%3c LORD, of all the best thereof, even the hallowed part thereof out of%0a%3c it.%0a%3c %0a%3c 18:30 Therefore thou shalt say unto them, When ye have heaved the best%0a%3c thereof from it, then it shall be counted unto the Levites as the%0a%3c increase of the threshingfloor, and as the increase of the winepress.%0a%3c %0a%3c 18:31 And ye shall eat it in every place, ye and your households: for%0a%3c it is your reward for your service in the tabernacle of the%0a%3c congregation.%0a%3c %0a%3c 18:32 And ye shall bear no sin by reason of it, when ye have heaved%0a%3c from it the best of it: neither shall ye pollute the holy things of%0a%3c the children of Israel, lest ye die.%0a%3c %0a%3c 19:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, 19:2 This%0a%3c is the ordinance of the law which the LORD hath commanded, saying,%0a%3c Speak unto the children of Israel, that they bring thee a red heifer%0a%3c without spot, wherein is no blemish, and upon which never came yoke:%0a%3c 19:3 And ye shall give her unto Eleazar the priest, that he may bring%0a%3c her forth without the camp, and one shall slay her before his face:%0a%3c 19:4 And Eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger,%0a%3c and sprinkle of her blood directly before the tabernacle of the%0a%3c congregation seven times: 19:5 And one shall burn the heifer in his%0a%3c sight; her skin, and her flesh, and her blood, with her dung, shall he%0a%3c burn: 19:6 And the priest shall take cedar wood, and hyssop, and%0a%3c scarlet, and cast it into the midst of the burning of the heifer.%0a%3c %0a%3c 19:7 Then the priest shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe his%0a%3c flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp, and the%0a%3c priest shall be unclean until the even.%0a%3c %0a%3c 19:8 And he that burneth her shall wash his clothes in water, and%0a%3c bathe his flesh in water, and shall be unclean until the even.%0a%3c %0a%3c 19:9 And a man that is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer,%0a%3c and lay them up without the camp in a clean place, and it shall be%0a%3c kept for the congregation of the children of Israel for a water of%0a%3c separation: it is a purification for sin.%0a%3c %0a%3c 19:10 And he that gathereth the ashes of the heifer shall wash his%0a%3c clothes, and be unclean until the even: and it shall be unto the%0a%3c children of Israel, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among them,%0a%3c for a statute for ever.%0a%3c %0a%3c 19:11 He that toucheth the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven%0a%3c days.%0a%3c %0a%3c 19:12 He shall purify himself with it on the third day, and on the%0a%3c seventh day he shall be clean: but if he purify not himself the third%0a%3c day, then the seventh day he shall not be clean.%0a%3c %0a%3c 19:13 Whosoever toucheth the dead body of any man that is dead, and%0a%3c purifieth not himself, defileth the tabernacle of the LORD; and that%0a%3c soul shall be cut off from Israel: because the water of separation was%0a%3c not sprinkled upon him, he shall be unclean; his uncleanness is yet%0a%3c upon him.%0a%3c %0a%3c 19:14 This is the law, when a man dieth in a tent: all that come into%0a%3c the tent, and all that is in the tent, shall be unclean seven days.%0a%3c %0a%3c 19:15 And every open vessel, which hath no covering bound upon it, is%0a%3c unclean.%0a%3c %0a%3c 19:16 And whosoever toucheth one that is slain with a sword in the%0a%3c open fields, or a dead body, or a bone of a man, or a grave, shall be%0a%3c unclean seven days.%0a%3c %0a%3c 19:17 And for an unclean person they shall take of the ashes of the%0a%3c burnt heifer of purification for sin, and running water shall be put%0a%3c thereto in a vessel: 19:18 And a clean person shall take hyssop, and%0a%3c dip it in the water, and sprinkle it upon the tent, and upon all the%0a%3c vessels, and upon the persons that were there, and upon him that%0a%3c touched a bone, or one slain, or one dead, or a grave: 19:19 And the%0a%3c clean person shall sprinkle upon the unclean on the third day, and on%0a%3c the seventh day: and on the seventh day he shall purify himself, and%0a%3c wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and shall be clean at%0a%3c even.%0a%3c %0a%3c 19:20 But the man that shall be unclean, and shall not purify himself,%0a%3c that soul shall be cut off from among the congregation, because he%0a%3c hath defiled the sanctuary of the LORD: the water of separation hath%0a%3c not been sprinkled upon him; he is unclean.%0a%3c %0a%3c 19:21 And it shall be a perpetual statute unto them, that he that%0a%3c sprinkleth the water of separation shall wash his clothes; and he that%0a%3c toucheth the water of separation shall be unclean until even.%0a%3c %0a%3c 19:22 And whatsoever the unclean person toucheth shall be unclean; and%0a%3c the soul that toucheth it shall be unclean until even.%0a%3c %0a%3c 20:1 Then came the children of Israel, even the whole congregation,%0a%3c into the desert of Zin in the first month: and the people abode in%0a%3c Kadesh; and Miriam died there, and was buried there.%0a%3c %0a%3c 20:2 And there was no water for the congregation: and they gathered%0a%3c themselves together against Moses and against Aaron.%0a%3c %0a%3c 20:3 And the people chode with Moses, and spake, saying, Would God%0a%3c that we had died when our brethren died before the LORD!  20:4 And why%0a%3c have ye brought up the congregation of the LORD into this wilderness,%0a%3c that we and our cattle should die there?  20:5 And wherefore have ye%0a%3c made us to come up out of Egypt, to bring us in unto this evil place?%0a%3c it is no place of seed, or of figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates;%0a%3c neither is there any water to drink.%0a%3c %0a%3c 20:6 And Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly unto%0a%3c the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they fell upon%0a%3c their faces: and the glory of the LORD appeared unto them.%0a%3c %0a%3c 20:7 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 20:8 Take the rod, and%0a%3c gather thou the assembly together, thou, and Aaron thy brother, and%0a%3c speak ye unto the rock before their eyes; and it shall give forth his%0a%3c water, and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock: so%0a%3c thou shalt give the congregation and their beasts drink.%0a%3c %0a%3c 20:9 And Moses took the rod from before the LORD, as he commanded him.%0a%3c %0a%3c 20:10 And Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before%0a%3c the rock, and he said unto them, Hear now, ye rebels; must we fetch%0a%3c you water out of this rock?  20:11 And Moses lifted up his hand, and%0a%3c with his rod he smote the rock twice: and the water came out%0a%3c abundantly, and the congregation drank, and their beasts also.%0a%3c %0a%3c 20:12 And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron, Because ye believed me%0a%3c not, to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel, therefore%0a%3c ye shall not bring this congregation into the land which I have given%0a%3c them.%0a%3c %0a%3c 20:13 This is the water of Meribah; because the children of Israel%0a%3c strove with the LORD, and he was sanctified in them.%0a%3c %0a%3c 20:14 And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh unto the king of Edom,%0a%3c Thus saith thy brother Israel, Thou knowest all the travail that hath%0a%3c befallen us: 20:15 How our fathers went down into Egypt, and we have%0a%3c dwelt in Egypt a long time; and the Egyptians vexed us, and our%0a%3c fathers: 20:16 And when we cried unto the LORD, he heard our voice,%0a%3c and sent an angel, and hath brought us forth out of Egypt: and,%0a%3c behold, we are in Kadesh, a city in the uttermost of thy border: 20:17%0a%3c Let us pass, I pray thee, through thy country: we will not pass%0a%3c through the fields, or through the vineyards, neither will we drink of%0a%3c the water of the wells: we will go by the king's high way, we will not%0a%3c turn to the right hand nor to the left, until we have passed thy%0a%3c borders.%0a%3c %0a%3c 20:18 And Edom said unto him, Thou shalt not pass by me, lest I come%0a%3c out against thee with the sword.%0a%3c %0a%3c 20:19 And the children of Israel said unto him, We will go by the high%0a%3c way: and if I and my cattle drink of thy water, then I will pay for%0a%3c it: I will only, without doing anything else, go through on my feet.%0a%3c %0a%3c 20:20 And he said, Thou shalt not go through. And Edom came out%0a%3c against him with much people, and with a strong hand.%0a%3c %0a%3c 20:21 Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border:%0a%3c wherefore Israel turned away from him.%0a%3c %0a%3c 20:22 And the children of Israel, even the whole congregation,%0a%3c journeyed from Kadesh, and came unto mount Hor.%0a%3c %0a%3c 20:23 And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron in mount Hor, by the%0a%3c coast of the land of Edom, saying, 20:24 Aaron shall be gathered unto%0a%3c his people: for he shall not enter into the land which I have given%0a%3c unto the children of Israel, because ye rebelled against my word at%0a%3c the water of Meribah.%0a%3c %0a%3c 20:25 Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up unto mount%0a%3c Hor: 20:26 And strip Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar%0a%3c his son: and Aaron shall be gathered unto his people, and shall die%0a%3c there.%0a%3c %0a%3c 20:27 And Moses did as the LORD commanded: and they went up into mount%0a%3c Hor in the sight of all the congregation.%0a%3c %0a%3c 20:28 And Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and put them upon%0a%3c Eleazar his son; and Aaron died there in the top of the mount: and%0a%3c Moses and Eleazar came down from the mount.%0a%3c %0a%3c 20:29 And when all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead, they%0a%3c mourned for Aaron thirty days, even all the house of Israel.%0a%3c %0a%3c 21:1 And when king Arad the Canaanite, which dwelt in the south, heard%0a%3c tell that Israel came by the way of the spies; then he fought against%0a%3c Israel, and took some of them prisoners.%0a%3c %0a%3c 21:2 And Israel vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said, If thou wilt%0a%3c indeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly destroy%0a%3c their cities.%0a%3c %0a%3c 21:3 And the LORD hearkened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up%0a%3c the Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them and their cities: and%0a%3c he called the name of the place Hormah.%0a%3c %0a%3c 21:4 And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way of the Red sea, to%0a%3c compass the land of Edom: and the soul of the people was much%0a%3c discouraged because of the way.%0a%3c %0a%3c 21:5 And the people spake against God, and against Moses, Wherefore%0a%3c have ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? for there%0a%3c is no bread, neither is there any water; and our soul loatheth this%0a%3c light bread.%0a%3c %0a%3c 21:6 And the LORD sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit%0a%3c the people; and much people of Israel died.%0a%3c %0a%3c 21:7 Therefore the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned, for%0a%3c we have spoken against the LORD, and against thee; pray unto the LORD,%0a%3c that he take away the serpents from us. And Moses prayed for the%0a%3c people.%0a%3c %0a%3c 21:8 And the LORD said unto Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent, and set%0a%3c it upon a pole: and it shall come to pass, that every one that is%0a%3c bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live.%0a%3c %0a%3c 21:9 And Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole, and it%0a%3c came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the%0a%3c serpent of brass, he lived.%0a%3c %0a%3c 21:10 And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in Oboth.%0a%3c %0a%3c 21:11 And they journeyed from Oboth, and pitched at Ijeabarim, in the%0a%3c wilderness which is before Moab, toward the sunrising.%0a%3c %0a%3c 21:12 From thence they removed, and pitched in the valley of Zared.%0a%3c %0a%3c 21:13 From thence they removed, and pitched on the other side of%0a%3c Arnon, which is in the wilderness that cometh out of the coasts of the%0a%3c Amorites: for Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the%0a%3c Amorites.%0a%3c %0a%3c 21:14 Wherefore it is said in the book of the wars of the LORD, What%0a%3c he did in the Red sea, and in the brooks of Arnon, 21:15 And at the%0a%3c stream of the brooks that goeth down to the dwelling of Ar, and lieth%0a%3c upon the border of Moab.%0a%3c %0a%3c 21:16 And from thence they went to Beer: that is the well whereof the%0a%3c LORD spake unto Moses, Gather the people together, and I will give%0a%3c them water.%0a%3c %0a%3c 21:17 Then Israel sang this song, Spring up, O well; sing ye unto it:%0a%3c 21:18 The princes digged the well, the nobles of the people digged it,%0a%3c by the direction of the lawgiver, with their staves. And from the%0a%3c wilderness they went to Mattanah: 21:19 And from Mattanah to Nahaliel:%0a%3c and from Nahaliel to Bamoth: 21:20 And from Bamoth in the valley, that%0a%3c is in the country of Moab, to the top of Pisgah, which looketh toward%0a%3c Jeshimon.%0a%3c %0a%3c 21:21 And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites,%0a%3c saying, 21:22 Let me pass through thy land: we will not turn into the%0a%3c fields, or into the vineyards; we will not drink of the waters of the%0a%3c well: but we will go along by the king's high way, until we be past%0a%3c thy borders.%0a%3c %0a%3c 21:23 And Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border:%0a%3c but Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out against%0a%3c Israel into the wilderness: and he came to Jahaz, and fought against%0a%3c Israel.%0a%3c %0a%3c 21:24 And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and possessed%0a%3c his land from Arnon unto Jabbok, even unto the children of Ammon: for%0a%3c the border of the children of Ammon was strong.%0a%3c %0a%3c 21:25 And Israel took all these cities: and Israel dwelt in all the%0a%3c cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all the villages thereof.%0a%3c %0a%3c 21:26 For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who%0a%3c had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out%0a%3c of his hand, even unto Arnon.%0a%3c %0a%3c 21:27 Wherefore they that speak in proverbs say, Come into Heshbon,%0a%3c let the city of Sihon be built and prepared: 21:28 For there is a fire%0a%3c gone out of Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon: it hath consumed%0a%3c Ar of Moab, and the lords of the high places of Arnon.%0a%3c %0a%3c 21:29 Woe to thee, Moab! thou art undone, O people of Chemosh: he hath%0a%3c given his sons that escaped, and his daughters, into captivity unto%0a%3c Sihon king of the Amorites.%0a%3c %0a%3c 21:30 We have shot at them; Heshbon is perished even unto Dibon, and%0a%3c we have laid them waste even unto Nophah, which reacheth unto Medeba.%0a%3c %0a%3c 21:31 Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites.%0a%3c %0a%3c 21:32 And Moses sent to spy out Jaazer, and they took the villages%0a%3c thereof, and drove out the Amorites that were there.%0a%3c %0a%3c 21:33 And they turned and went up by the way of Bashan: and Og the%0a%3c king of Bashan went out against them, he, and all his people, to the%0a%3c battle at Edrei.%0a%3c %0a%3c 21:34 And the LORD said unto Moses, Fear him not: for I have delivered%0a%3c him into thy hand, and all his people, and his land; and thou shalt do%0a%3c to him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at%0a%3c Heshbon.%0a%3c %0a%3c 21:35 So they smote him, and his sons, and all his people, until there%0a%3c was none left him alive: and they possessed his land.%0a%3c %0a%3c 22:1 And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in the plains%0a%3c of Moab on this side Jordan by Jericho.%0a%3c %0a%3c 22:2 And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the%0a%3c Amorites.%0a%3c %0a%3c 22:3 And Moab was sore afraid of the people, because they were many:%0a%3c and Moab was distressed because of the children of Israel.%0a%3c %0a%3c 22:4 And Moab said unto the elders of Midian, Now shall this company%0a%3c lick up all that are round about us, as the ox licketh up the grass of%0a%3c the field.%0a%3c %0a%3c And Balak the son of Zippor was king of the Moabites at that time.%0a%3c %0a%3c 22:5 He sent messengers therefore unto Balaam the son of Beor to%0a%3c Pethor, which is by the river of the land of the children of his%0a%3c people, to call him, saying, Behold, there is a people come out from%0a%3c Egypt: behold, they cover the face of the earth, and they abide over%0a%3c against me: 22:6 Come now therefore, I pray thee, curse me this%0a%3c people; for they are too mighty for me: peradventure I shall prevail,%0a%3c that we may smite them, and that I may drive them out of the land: for%0a%3c I wot that he whom thou blessest is blessed, and he whom thou cursest%0a%3c is cursed.%0a%3c %0a%3c 22:7 And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the%0a%3c rewards of divination in their hand; and they came unto Balaam, and%0a%3c spake unto him the words of Balak.%0a%3c %0a%3c 22:8 And he said unto them, Lodge here this night, and I will bring%0a%3c you word again, as the LORD shall speak unto me: and the princes of%0a%3c Moab abode with Balaam.%0a%3c %0a%3c 22:9 And God came unto Balaam, and said, What men are these with thee?%0a%3c 22:10 And Balaam said unto God, Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab,%0a%3c hath sent unto me, saying, 22:11 Behold, there is a people come out of%0a%3c Egypt, which covereth the face of the earth: come now, curse me them;%0a%3c peradventure I shall be able to overcome them, and drive them out.%0a%3c %0a%3c 22:12 And God said unto Balaam, Thou shalt not go with them; thou%0a%3c shalt not curse the people: for they are blessed.%0a%3c %0a%3c 22:13 And Balaam rose up in the morning, and said unto the princes of%0a%3c Balak, Get you into your land: for the LORD refuseth to give me leave%0a%3c to go with you.%0a%3c %0a%3c 22:14 And the princes of Moab rose up, and they went unto Balak, and%0a%3c said, Balaam refuseth to come with us.%0a%3c %0a%3c 22:15 And Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honourable than%0a%3c they.%0a%3c %0a%3c 22:16 And they came to Balaam, and said to him, Thus saith Balak the%0a%3c son of Zippor, Let nothing, I pray thee, hinder thee from coming unto%0a%3c me: 22:17 For I will promote thee unto very great honour, and I will%0a%3c do whatsoever thou sayest unto me: come therefore, I pray thee, curse%0a%3c me this people.%0a%3c %0a%3c 22:18 And Balaam answered and said unto the servants of Balak, If%0a%3c Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go%0a%3c beyond the word of the LORD my God, to do less or more.%0a%3c %0a%3c 22:19 Now therefore, I pray you, tarry ye also here this night, that I%0a%3c may know what the LORD will say unto me more.%0a%3c %0a%3c 22:20 And God came unto Balaam at night, and said unto him, If the men%0a%3c come to call thee, rise up, and go with them; but yet the word which I%0a%3c shall say unto thee, that shalt thou do.%0a%3c %0a%3c 22:21 And Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and went%0a%3c with the princes of Moab.%0a%3c %0a%3c 22:22 And God's anger was kindled because he went: and the angel of%0a%3c the LORD stood in the way for an adversary against him. Now he was%0a%3c riding upon his ass, and his two servants were with him.%0a%3c %0a%3c 22:23 And the ass saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and%0a%3c his sword drawn in his hand: and the ass turned aside out of the way,%0a%3c and went into the field: and Balaam smote the ass, to turn her into%0a%3c the way.%0a%3c %0a%3c 22:24 But the angel of the LORD stood in a path of the vineyards, a%0a%3c wall being on this side, and a wall on that side.%0a%3c %0a%3c 22:25 And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she thrust herself%0a%3c unto the wall, and crushed Balaam's foot against the wall: and he%0a%3c smote her again.%0a%3c %0a%3c 22:26 And the angel of the LORD went further, and stood in a narrow%0a%3c place, where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the%0a%3c left.%0a%3c %0a%3c 22:27 And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she fell down under%0a%3c Balaam: and Balaam's anger was kindled, and he smote the ass with a%0a%3c staff.%0a%3c %0a%3c 22:28 And the LORD opened the mouth of the ass, and she said unto%0a%3c Balaam, What have I done unto thee, that thou hast smitten me these%0a%3c three times?  22:29 And Balaam said unto the ass, Because thou hast%0a%3c mocked me: I would there were a sword in mine hand, for now would I%0a%3c kill thee.%0a%3c %0a%3c 22:30 And the ass said unto Balaam, Am not I thine ass, upon which%0a%3c thou hast ridden ever since I was thine unto this day? was I ever wont%0a%3c to do so unto thee? And he said, Nay.%0a%3c %0a%3c 22:31 Then the LORD opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of%0a%3c the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and he%0a%3c bowed down his head, and fell flat on his face.%0a%3c %0a%3c 22:32 And the angel of the LORD said unto him, Wherefore hast thou%0a%3c smitten thine ass these three times? behold, I went out to withstand%0a%3c thee, because thy way is perverse before me: 22:33 And the ass saw me,%0a%3c and turned from me these three times: unless she had turned from me,%0a%3c surely now also I had slain thee, and saved her alive.%0a%3c %0a%3c 22:34 And Balaam said unto the angel of the LORD, I have sinned; for I%0a%3c knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me: now therefore, if%0a%3c it displease thee, I will get me back again.%0a%3c %0a%3c 22:35 And the angel of the LORD said unto Balaam, Go with the men: but%0a%3c only the word that I shall speak unto thee, that thou shalt speak. So%0a%3c Balaam went with the princes of Balak.%0a%3c %0a%3c 22:36 And when Balak heard that Balaam was come, he went out to meet%0a%3c him unto a city of Moab, which is in the border of Arnon, which is in%0a%3c the utmost coast.%0a%3c %0a%3c 22:37 And Balak said unto Balaam, Did I not earnestly send unto thee%0a%3c to call thee? wherefore camest thou not unto me? am I not able indeed%0a%3c to promote thee to honour?  22:38 And Balaam said unto Balak, Lo, I am%0a%3c come unto thee: have I now any power at all to say any thing? the word%0a%3c that God putteth in my mouth, that shall I speak.%0a%3c %0a%3c 22:39 And Balaam went with Balak, and they came unto Kirjathhuzoth.%0a%3c %0a%3c 22:40 And Balak offered oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the%0a%3c princes that were with him.%0a%3c %0a%3c 22:41 And it came to pass on the morrow, that Balak took Balaam, and%0a%3c brought him up into the high places of Baal, that thence he might see%0a%3c the utmost part of the people.%0a%3c %0a%3c 23:1 And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and%0a%3c prepare me here seven oxen and seven rams.%0a%3c %0a%3c 23:2 And Balak did as Balaam had spoken; and Balak and Balaam offered%0a%3c on every altar a bullock and a ram.%0a%3c %0a%3c 23:3 And Balaam said unto Balak, Stand by thy burnt offering, and I%0a%3c will go: peradventure the LORD will come to meet me: and whatsoever he%0a%3c sheweth me I will tell thee. And he went to an high place.%0a%3c %0a%3c 23:4 And God met Balaam: and he said unto him, I have prepared seven%0a%3c altars, and I have offered upon every altar a bullock and a ram.%0a%3c %0a%3c 23:5 And the LORD put a word in Balaam's mouth, and said, Return unto%0a%3c Balak, and thus thou shalt speak.%0a%3c %0a%3c 23:6 And he returned unto him, and, lo, he stood by his burnt%0a%3c sacrifice, he, and all the princes of Moab.%0a%3c %0a%3c 23:7 And he took up his parable, and said, Balak the king of Moab hath%0a%3c brought me from Aram, out of the mountains of the east, saying, Come,%0a%3c curse me Jacob, and come, defy Israel.%0a%3c %0a%3c 23:8 How shall I curse, whom God hath not cursed? or how shall I defy,%0a%3c whom the LORD hath not defied?  23:9 For from the top of the rocks I%0a%3c see him, and from the hills I behold him: lo, the people shall dwell%0a%3c alone, and shall not be reckoned among the nations.%0a%3c %0a%3c 23:10 Who can count the dust of Jacob, and the number of the fourth%0a%3c part of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my last%0a%3c end be like his!  23:11 And Balak said unto Balaam, What hast thou%0a%3c done unto me? I took thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou%0a%3c hast blessed them altogether.%0a%3c %0a%3c 23:12 And he answered and said, Must I not take heed to speak that%0a%3c which the LORD hath put in my mouth?  23:13 And Balak said unto him,%0a%3c Come, I pray thee, with me unto another place, from whence thou mayest%0a%3c see them: thou shalt see but the utmost part of them, and shalt not%0a%3c see them all: and curse me them from thence.%0a%3c %0a%3c 23:14 And he brought him into the field of Zophim, to the top of%0a%3c Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered a bullock and a ram on%0a%3c every altar.%0a%3c %0a%3c 23:15 And he said unto Balak, Stand here by thy burnt offering, while%0a%3c I meet the LORD yonder.%0a%3c %0a%3c 23:16 And the LORD met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and said,%0a%3c Go again unto Balak, and say thus.%0a%3c %0a%3c 23:17 And when he came to him, behold, he stood by his burnt offering,%0a%3c and the princes of Moab with him. And Balak said unto him, What hath%0a%3c the LORD spoken?  23:18 And he took up his parable, and said, Rise up,%0a%3c Balak, and hear; hearken unto me, thou son of Zippor: 23:19 God is not%0a%3c a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should%0a%3c repent: hath he said, and shall he not do it? or hath he spoken, and%0a%3c shall he not make it good?  23:20 Behold, I have received commandment%0a%3c to bless: and he hath blessed; and I cannot reverse it.%0a%3c %0a%3c 23:21 He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither hath he seen%0a%3c perverseness in Israel: the LORD his God is with him, and the shout of%0a%3c a king is among them.%0a%3c %0a%3c 23:22 God brought them out of Egypt; he hath as it were the strength%0a%3c of an unicorn.%0a%3c %0a%3c 23:23 Surely there is no enchantment against Jacob, neither is there%0a%3c any divination against Israel: according to this time it shall be said%0a%3c of Jacob and of Israel, What hath God wrought!  23:24 Behold, the%0a%3c people shall rise up as a great lion, and lift up himself as a young%0a%3c lion: he shall not lie down until he eat of the prey, and drink the%0a%3c blood of the slain.%0a%3c %0a%3c 23:25 And Balak said unto Balaam, Neither curse them at all, nor bless%0a%3c them at all.%0a%3c %0a%3c 23:26 But Balaam answered and said unto Balak, Told not I thee,%0a%3c saying, All that the LORD speaketh, that I must do?  23:27 And Balak%0a%3c said unto Balaam, Come, I pray thee, I will bring thee unto another%0a%3c place; peradventure it will please God that thou mayest curse me them%0a%3c from thence.%0a%3c %0a%3c 23:28 And Balak brought Balaam unto the top of Peor, that looketh%0a%3c toward Jeshimon.%0a%3c %0a%3c 23:29 And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and%0a%3c prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams.%0a%3c %0a%3c 23:30 And Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered a bullock and a%0a%3c ram on every altar.%0a%3c %0a%3c 24:1 And when Balaam saw that it pleased the LORD to bless Israel, he%0a%3c went not, as at other times, to seek for enchantments, but he set his%0a%3c face toward the wilderness.%0a%3c %0a%3c 24:2 And Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel abiding in his%0a%3c tents according to their tribes; and the spirit of God came upon him.%0a%3c %0a%3c 24:3 And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor hath%0a%3c said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said: 24:4 He hath said,%0a%3c which heard the words of God, which saw the vision of the Almighty,%0a%3c falling into a trance, but having his eyes open: 24:5 How goodly are%0a%3c thy tents, O Jacob, and thy tabernacles, O Israel!  24:6 As the%0a%3c valleys are they spread forth, as gardens by the river's side, as the%0a%3c trees of lign aloes which the LORD hath planted, and as cedar trees%0a%3c beside the waters.%0a%3c %0a%3c 24:7 He shall pour the water out of his buckets, and his seed shall be%0a%3c in many waters, and his king shall be higher than Agag, and his%0a%3c kingdom shall be exalted.%0a%3c %0a%3c 24:8 God brought him forth out of Egypt; he hath as it were the%0a%3c strength of an unicorn: he shall eat up the nations his enemies, and%0a%3c shall break their bones, and pierce them through with his arrows.%0a%3c %0a%3c 24:9 He couched, he lay down as a lion, and as a great lion: who shall%0a%3c stir him up? Blessed is he that blesseth thee, and cursed is he that%0a%3c curseth thee.%0a%3c %0a%3c 24:10 And Balak's anger was kindled against Balaam, and he smote his%0a%3c hands together: and Balak said unto Balaam, I called thee to curse%0a%3c mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast altogether blessed them these%0a%3c three times.%0a%3c %0a%3c 24:11 Therefore now flee thou to thy place: I thought to promote thee%0a%3c unto great honour; but, lo, the LORD hath kept thee back from honour.%0a%3c %0a%3c 24:12 And Balaam said unto Balak, Spake I not also to thy messengers%0a%3c which thou sentest unto me, saying, 24:13 If Balak would give me his%0a%3c house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the commandment of%0a%3c the LORD, to do either good or bad of mine own mind; but what the LORD%0a%3c saith, that will I speak?  24:14 And now, behold, I go unto my people:%0a%3c come therefore, and I will advertise thee what this people shall do to%0a%3c thy people in the latter days.%0a%3c %0a%3c 24:15 And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor%0a%3c hath said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said: 24:16 He hath%0a%3c said, which heard the words of God, and knew the knowledge of the most%0a%3c High, which saw the vision of the Almighty, falling into a trance, but%0a%3c having his eyes open: 24:17 I shall see him, but not now: I shall%0a%3c behold him, but not nigh: there shall come a Star out of Jacob, and a%0a%3c Sceptre shall rise out of Israel, and shall smite the corners of Moab,%0a%3c and destroy all the children of Sheth.%0a%3c %0a%3c 24:18 And Edom shall be a possession, Seir also shall be a possession%0a%3c for his enemies; and Israel shall do valiantly.%0a%3c %0a%3c 24:19 Out of Jacob shall come he that shall have dominion, and shall%0a%3c destroy him that remaineth of the city.%0a%3c %0a%3c 24:20 And when he looked on Amalek, he took up his parable, and said,%0a%3c Amalek was the first of the nations; but his latter end shall be that%0a%3c he perish for ever.%0a%3c %0a%3c 24:21 And he looked on the Kenites, and took up his parable, and said,%0a%3c Strong is thy dwellingplace, and thou puttest thy nest in a rock.%0a%3c %0a%3c 24:22 Nevertheless the Kenite shall be wasted, until Asshur shall%0a%3c carry thee away captive.%0a%3c %0a%3c 24:23 And he took up his parable, and said, Alas, who shall live when%0a%3c God doeth this!  24:24 And ships shall come from the coast of Chittim,%0a%3c and shall afflict Asshur, and shall afflict Eber, and he also shall%0a%3c perish for ever.%0a%3c %0a%3c 24:25 And Balaam rose up, and went and returned to his place: and%0a%3c Balak also went his way.%0a%3c %0a%3c 25:1 And Israel abode in Shittim, and the people began to commit%0a%3c whoredom with the daughters of Moab.%0a%3c %0a%3c 25:2 And they called the people unto the sacrifices of their gods: and%0a%3c the people did eat, and bowed down to their gods.%0a%3c %0a%3c 25:3 And Israel joined himself unto Baalpeor: and the anger of the%0a%3c LORD was kindled against Israel.%0a%3c %0a%3c 25:4 And the LORD said unto Moses, Take all the heads of the people,%0a%3c and hang them up before the LORD against the sun, that the fierce%0a%3c anger of the LORD may be turned away from Israel.%0a%3c %0a%3c 25:5 And Moses said unto the judges of Israel, Slay ye every one his%0a%3c men that were joined unto Baalpeor.%0a%3c %0a%3c 25:6 And, behold, one of the children of Israel came and brought unto%0a%3c his brethren a Midianitish woman in the sight of Moses, and in the%0a%3c sight of all the congregation of the children of Israel, who were%0a%3c weeping before the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.%0a%3c %0a%3c 25:7 And when Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the%0a%3c priest, saw it, he rose up from among the congregation, and took a%0a%3c javelin in his hand; 25:8 And he went after the man of Israel into the%0a%3c tent, and thrust both of them through, the man of Israel, and the%0a%3c woman through her belly. So the plague was stayed from the children of%0a%3c Israel.%0a%3c %0a%3c 25:9 And those that died in the plague were twenty and four thousand.%0a%3c %0a%3c 25:10 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 25:11 Phinehas, the son%0a%3c of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, hath turned my wrath away%0a%3c from the children of Israel, while he was zealous for my sake among%0a%3c them, that I consumed not the children of Israel in my jealousy.%0a%3c %0a%3c 25:12 Wherefore say, Behold, I give unto him my covenant of peace:%0a%3c 25:13 And he shall have it, and his seed after him, even the covenant%0a%3c of an everlasting priesthood; because he was zealous for his God, and%0a%3c made an atonement for the children of Israel.%0a%3c %0a%3c 25:14 Now the name of the Israelite that was slain, even that was%0a%3c slain with the Midianitish woman, was Zimri, the son of Salu, a prince%0a%3c of a chief house among the Simeonites.%0a%3c %0a%3c 25:15 And the name of the Midianitish woman that was slain was Cozbi,%0a%3c the daughter of Zur; he was head over a people, and of a chief house%0a%3c in Midian.%0a%3c %0a%3c 25:16 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 25:17 Vex the Midianites,%0a%3c and smite them: 25:18 For they vex you with their wiles, wherewith%0a%3c they have beguiled you in the matter of Peor, and in the matter of%0a%3c Cozbi, the daughter of a prince of Midian, their sister, which was%0a%3c slain in the day of the plague for Peor's sake.%0a%3c %0a%3c 26:1 And it came to pass after the plague, that the LORD spake unto%0a%3c Moses and unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, saying, 26:2 Take%0a%3c the sum of all the congregation of the children of Israel, from twenty%0a%3c years old and upward, throughout their fathers' house, all that are%0a%3c able to go to war in Israel.%0a%3c %0a%3c 26:3 And Moses and Eleazar the priest spake with them in the plains of%0a%3c Moab by Jordan near Jericho, saying, 26:4 Take the sum of the people,%0a%3c from twenty years old and upward; as the LORD commanded Moses and the%0a%3c children of Israel, which went forth out of the land of Egypt.%0a%3c %0a%3c 26:5 Reuben, the eldest son of Israel: the children of Reuben; Hanoch,%0a%3c of whom cometh the family of the Hanochites: of Pallu, the family of%0a%3c the Palluites: 26:6 Of Hezron, the family of the Hezronites: of Carmi,%0a%3c the family of the Carmites.%0a%3c %0a%3c 26:7 These are the families of the Reubenites: and they that were%0a%3c numbered of them were forty and three thousand and seven hundred and%0a%3c thirty.%0a%3c %0a%3c 26:8 And the sons of Pallu; Eliab.%0a%3c %0a%3c 26:9 And the sons of Eliab; Nemuel, and Dathan, and Abiram.

he shall not break his word, he shall do according%0a%3c to all that proceedeth out of his mouth.%0a%3c %0a%3c 30:3 If a woman also vow a vow unto the LORD, and bind herself by a%0a%3c bond, being in her father's house in her youth; 30:4 And her father%0a%3c hear her vow, and her bond wherewith she hath bound her soul, and her%0a%3c father shall hold his peace at her; then all her vows shall stand, and%0a%3c every bond wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand.%0a%3c %0a%3c 30:5 But if her father disallow her in the day that he heareth; not%0a%3c any of her vows, or of her bonds wherewith she hath bound her soul,%0a%3c shall stand: and the LORD shall forgive her, because her father%0a%3c disallowed her.%0a%3c %0a%3c 30:6 And if she had at all an husband, when she vowed, or uttered%0a%3c ought out of her lips, wherewith she bound her soul; 30:7 And her%0a%3c husband heard it, and held his peace at her in the day that he heard%0a%3c it: then her vows shall stand, and her bonds wherewith she bound her%0a%3c soul shall stand.%0a%3c %0a%3c 30:8 But if her husband disallowed her on the day that he heard it;%0a%3c then he shall make her vow which she vowed, and that which she uttered%0a%3c with her lips, wherewith she bound her soul, of none effect: and the%0a%3c LORD shall forgive her.%0a%3c %0a%3c 30:9 But every vow of a widow, and of her that is divorced, wherewith%0a%3c they have bound their souls, shall stand against her.%0a%3c %0a%3c 30:10 And if she vowed in her husband's house, or bound her soul by a%0a%3c bond with an oath;

then whatsoever proceeded out of her lips concerning her%0a%3c vows, or concerning the bond of her soul, shall not stand: her husband%0a%3c hath made them void; and the LORD shall forgive her.%0a%3c %0a%3c 30:13 Every vow, and every binding oath to afflict the soul, her%0a%3c husband may establish it, or her husband may make it void.%0a%3c %0a%3c 30:14 But if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from day to%0a%3c day; then he establisheth all her vows, or all her bonds, which are%0a%3c upon her: he confirmeth them, because he held his peace at her in the%0a%3c day that he heard them.%0a%3c %0a%3c 30:15 But if he shall any ways make them void after that he hath heard%0a%3c them; then he shall bear her iniquity.%0a%3c %0a%3c 30:16 These are the statutes, which the LORD commanded Moses, between%0a%3c a man and his wife, between the father and his daughter, being yet in%0a%3c her youth in her father's house.%0a%3c %0a%3c 31:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 31:2 Avenge the children%0a%3c of Israel of the Midianites: afterward shalt thou be gathered unto thy%0a%3c people.%0a%3c %0a%3c 31:3 And Moses spake unto the people, saying, Arm some of yourselves%0a%3c unto the war, and let them go against the Midianites, and avenge the%0a%3c LORD of Midian.%0a%3c %0a%3c 31:4 Of every tribe a thousand, throughout all the tribes of Israel,%0a%3c shall ye send to the war.%0a%3c %0a%3c 31:5 So there were delivered out of the thousands of Israel, a%0a%3c thousand of every tribe, twelve thousand armed for war.%0a%3c %0a%3c 31:6 And Moses sent them to the war, a thousand of every tribe, them%0a%3c and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, to the war, with the holy%0a%3c instruments, and the trumpets to blow in his hand.%0a%3c %0a%3c 31:7 And they warred against the Midianites, as the LORD commanded%0a%3c Moses; and they slew all the males.%0a%3c %0a%3c 31:8 And they slew the kings of Midian, beside the rest of them that%0a%3c were slain; namely, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, five%0a%3c kings of Midian: Balaam also the son of Beor they slew with the sword.%0a%3c %0a%3c 31:9 And the children of Israel took all the women of Midian captives,%0a%3c and their little ones, and took the spoil of all their cattle, and all%0a%3c their flocks, and all their goods.%0a%3c %0a%3c 31:10 And they burnt all their cities wherein they dwelt, and all%0a%3c their goodly castles, with fire.%0a%3c %0a%3c 31:11 And they took all the spoil, and all the prey, both of men and%0a%3c of beasts.%0a%3c %0a%3c 31:12 And they brought the captives, and the prey, and the spoil, unto%0a%3c Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and unto the congregation of the%0a%3c children of Israel, unto the camp at the plains of Moab, which are by%0a%3c Jordan near Jericho.%0a%3c %0a%3c 31:13 And Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and all the princes of the%0a%3c congregation, went forth to meet them without the camp.%0a%3c %0a%3c 31:14 And Moses was wroth with the officers of the host, with the%0a%3c captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, which came from%0a%3c the battle.%0a%3c %0a%3c 31:15 And Moses said unto them, Have ye saved all the women alive?%0a%3c 31:16 Behold, these caused the children of Israel, through the counsel%0a%3c of Balaam, to commit trespass against the LORD in the matter of Peor,%0a%3c and there was a plague among the congregation of the LORD.%0a%3c %0a%3c 31:17 Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill%0a%3c every woman that hath known man by lying with him.%0a%3c %0a%3c 31:18 But all the women children, that have not known a man by lying%0a%3c with him, keep alive for yourselves.%0a%3c %0a%3c 31:19 And do ye abide without the camp seven days: whosoever hath%0a%3c killed any person, and whosoever hath touched any slain, purify both%0a%3c yourselves and your captives on the third day, and on the seventh day.%0a%3c %0a%3c 31:20 And purify all your raiment, and all that is made of skins, and%0a%3c all work of goats' hair, and all things made of wood.%0a%3c %0a%3c 31:21 And Eleazar the priest said unto the men of war which went to%0a%3c the battle, This is the ordinance of the law which the LORD commanded%0a%3c Moses; 31:22 Only the gold, and the silver, the brass, the iron, the%0a%3c tin, and the lead, 31:23 Every thing that may abide the fire, ye shall%0a%3c make it go through the fire, and it shall be clean: nevertheless it%0a%3c shall be purified with the water of separation: and all that abideth%0a%3c not the fire ye shall make go through the water.%0a%3c %0a%3c 31:24 And ye shall wash your clothes on the seventh day, and ye shall%0a%3c be clean, and afterward ye shall come into the camp.%0a%3c %0a%3c 31:25 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 31:26 Take the sum of the%0a%3c prey that was taken, both of man and of beast, thou, and Eleazar the%0a%3c priest, and the chief fathers of the congregation: 31:27 And divide%0a%3c the prey into two parts; between them that took the war upon them, who%0a%3c went out to battle, and between all the congregation: 31:28 And levy a%0a%3c tribute unto the Lord of the men of war which went out to battle: one%0a%3c soul of five hundred, both of the persons, and of the beeves, and of%0a%3c the asses, and of the sheep: 31:29 Take it of their half, and give it%0a%3c unto Eleazar the priest, for an heave offering of the LORD.%0a%3c %0a%3c 31:30 And of the children of Israel's half, thou shalt take one%0a%3c portion of fifty, of the persons, of the beeves, of the asses, and of%0a%3c the flocks, of all manner of beasts, and give them unto the Levites,%0a%3c which keep the charge of the tabernacle of the LORD.%0a%3c %0a%3c 31:31 And Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the LORD commanded%0a%3c Moses.%0a%3c %0a%3c 31:32 And the booty, being the rest of the prey which the men of war%0a%3c had caught, was six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and five%0a%3c thousand sheep, 31:33 And threescore and twelve thousand beeves, 31:34%0a%3c And threescore and one thousand asses, 31:35 And thirty and two%0a%3c thousand persons in all, of women that had not known man by lying with%0a%3c him.%0a%3c %0a%3c 31:36 And the half, which was the portion of them that went out to%0a%3c war, was in number three hundred thousand and seven and thirty%0a%3c thousand and five hundred sheep: 31:37 And the LORD's tribute of the%0a%3c sheep was six hundred and threescore and fifteen.%0a%3c %0a%3c 31:38 And the beeves were thirty and six thousand; of which the LORD's%0a%3c tribute was threescore and twelve.%0a%3c %0a%3c 31:39 And the asses were thirty thousand and five hundred; of which%0a%3c the LORD's tribute was threescore and one.%0a%3c %0a%3c 31:40 And the persons were sixteen thousand; of which the LORD's%0a%3c tribute was thirty and two persons.%0a%3c %0a%3c 31:41 And Moses gave the tribute, which was the LORD's heave offering,%0a%3c unto Eleazar the priest, as the LORD commanded Moses.%0a%3c %0a%3c 31:42 And of the children of Israel's half, which Moses divided from%0a%3c the men that warred, 31:43 (Now the half that pertained unto the%0a%3c congregation was three hundred thousand and thirty thousand and seven%0a%3c thousand and five hundred sheep, 31:44 And thirty and six thousand%0a%3c beeves, 31:45 And thirty thousand asses and five hundred, 31:46 And%0a%3c sixteen thousand persons;) 31:47 Even of the children of Israel's%0a%3c half, Moses took one portion of fifty, both of man and of beast, and%0a%3c gave them unto the Levites, which kept the charge of the tabernacle of%0a%3c the LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses.%0a%3c %0a%3c 31:48 And the officers which were over thousands of the host, the%0a%3c captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, came near unto Moses:%0a%3c 31:49 And they said unto Moses, Thy servants have taken the sum of the%0a%3c men of war which are under our charge, and there lacketh not one man%0a%3c of us.%0a%3c %0a%3c 31:50 We have therefore brought an oblation for the LORD, what every%0a%3c man hath gotten, of jewels of gold, chains, and bracelets, rings,%0a%3c earrings, and tablets, to make an atonement for our souls before the%0a%3c LORD.%0a%3c %0a%3c 31:51 And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of them, even all%0a%3c wrought jewels.%0a%3c %0a%3c 31:52 And all the gold of the offering that they offered up to the%0a%3c LORD, of the captains of thousands, and of the captains of hundreds,%0a%3c was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels.%0a%3c %0a%3c 31:53 (For the men of war had taken spoil, every man for himself.)%0a%3c 31:54 And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains%0a%3c of thousands and of hundreds, and brought it into the tabernacle of%0a%3c the congregation, for a memorial for the children of Israel before the%0a%3c LORD.%0a%3c %0a%3c 32:1 Now the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had a very%0a%3c great multitude of cattle: and when they saw the land of Jazer, and%0a%3c the land of Gilead, that, behold, the place was a place for cattle;%0a%3c 32:2 The children of Gad and the children of Reuben came and spake%0a%3c unto Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and unto the princes of the%0a%3c congregation, saying, 32:3 Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and Nimrah,%0a%3c and Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Shebam, and Nebo, and Beon, 32:4 Even%0a%3c the country which the LORD smote before the congregation of Israel, is%0a%3c a land for cattle, and thy servants have cattle: 32:5 Wherefore, said%0a%3c they, if we have found grace in thy sight, let this land be given unto%0a%3c thy servants for a possession, and bring us not over Jordan.%0a%3c %0a%3c 32:6 And Moses said unto the children of Gad and to the children of%0a%3c Reuben, Shall your brethren go to war, and shall ye sit here?  32:7%0a%3c And wherefore discourage ye the heart of the children of Israel from%0a%3c going over into the land which the LORD hath given them?  32:8 Thus%0a%3c did your fathers, when I sent them from Kadeshbarnea to see the land.%0a%3c %0a%3c 32:9 For when they went up unto the valley of Eshcol, and saw the%0a%3c land, they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel, that they%0a%3c should not go into the land which the LORD had given them.%0a%3c %0a%3c 32:10 And the LORD's anger was kindled the same time, and he sware,%0a%3c saying, 32:11 Surely none of the men that came up out of Egypt, from%0a%3c twenty years old and upward, shall see the land which I sware unto%0a%3c Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob; because they have not wholly%0a%3c followed me: 32:12 Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite, and%0a%3c Joshua the son of Nun: for they have wholly followed the LORD.%0a%3c %0a%3c 32:13 And the LORD's anger was kindled against Israel, and he made%0a%3c them wander in the wilderness forty years, until all the generation,%0a%3c that had done evil in the sight of the LORD, was consumed.%0a%3c %0a%3c 32:14 And, behold, ye are risen up in your fathers' stead, an increase%0a%3c of sinful men, to augment yet the fierce anger of the LORD toward%0a%3c Israel.%0a%3c %0a%3c 32:15 For if ye turn away from after him, he will yet again leave them%0a%3c in the wilderness; and ye shall destroy all this people.%0a%3c %0a%3c 32:16 And they came near unto him, and said, We will build sheepfolds%0a%3c here for our cattle, and cities for our little ones: 32:17 But we%0a%3c ourselves will go ready armed before the children of Israel, until we%0a%3c have brought them unto their place: and our little ones shall dwell in%0a%3c the fenced cities because of the inhabitants of the land.%0a%3c %0a%3c 32:18 We will not return unto our houses, until the children of Israel%0a%3c have inherited every man his inheritance.%0a%3c %0a%3c 32:19 For we will not inherit with them on yonder side Jordan, or%0a%3c forward; because our inheritance is fallen to us on this side Jordan%0a%3c eastward.%0a%3c %0a%3c 32:20 And Moses said unto them, If ye will do this thing, if ye will%0a%3c go armed before the LORD to war, 32:21 And will go all of you armed%0a%3c over Jordan before the LORD, until he hath driven out his enemies from%0a%3c before him, 32:22 And the land be subdued before the LORD: then%0a%3c afterward ye shall return, and be guiltless before the LORD, and%0a%3c before Israel; and this land shall be your possession before the LORD.%0a%3c %0a%3c 32:23 But if ye will not do so, behold, ye have sinned against the%0a%3c LORD: and be sure your sin will find you out.%0a%3c %0a%3c 32:24 Build you cities for your little ones, and folds for your sheep;%0a%3c and do that which hath proceeded out of your mouth.%0a%3c %0a%3c 32:25 And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben spake unto%0a%3c Moses, saying, Thy servants will do as my lord commandeth.%0a%3c %0a%3c 32:26 Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our cattle,%0a%3c shall be there in the cities of Gilead: 32:27 But thy servants will%0a%3c pass over, every man armed for war, before the LORD to battle, as my%0a%3c lord saith.%0a%3c %0a%3c 32:28 So concerning them Moses commanded Eleazar the priest, and%0a%3c Joshua the son of Nun, and the chief fathers of the tribes of the%0a%3c children of Israel: 32:29 And Moses said unto them, If the children of%0a%3c Gad and the children of Reuben will pass with you over Jordan, every%0a%3c man armed to battle, before the LORD, and the land shall be subdued%0a%3c before you; then ye shall give them the land of Gilead for a%0a%3c possession: 32:30 But if they will not pass over with you armed, they%0a%3c shall have possessions among you in the land of Canaan.%0a%3c %0a%3c 32:31 And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered,%0a%3c saying, As the LORD hath said unto thy servants, so will we do.%0a%3c %0a%3c 32:32 We will pass over armed before the LORD into the land of Canaan,%0a%3c that the possession of our inheritance on this side Jordan may be%0a%3c ours.%0a%3c %0a%3c 32:33 And Moses gave unto them, even to the children of Gad, and to%0a%3c the children of Reuben, and unto half the tribe of Manasseh the son of%0a%3c Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, and the kingdom of%0a%3c Og king of Bashan, the land, with the cities thereof in the coasts,%0a%3c even the cities of the country round about.%0a%3c %0a%3c 32:34 And the children of Gad built Dibon, and Ataroth, and Aroer,%0a%3c 32:35 And Atroth, Shophan, and Jaazer, and Jogbehah, 32:36 And%0a%3c Bethnimrah, and Bethharan, fenced cities: and folds for sheep.%0a%3c %0a%3c 32:37 And the children of Reuben built Heshbon, and Elealeh, and%0a%3c Kirjathaim, 32:38 And Nebo, and Baalmeon, (their names being changed,)%0a%3c and Shibmah: and gave other names unto the cities which they builded.%0a%3c %0a%3c 32:39 And the children of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead,%0a%3c and took it, and dispossessed the Amorite which was in it.%0a%3c %0a%3c 32:40 And Moses gave Gilead unto Machir the son of Manasseh; and he%0a%3c dwelt therein.%0a%3c %0a%3c 32:41 And Jair the son of Manasseh went and took the small towns%0a%3c thereof, and called them Havothjair.%0a%3c %0a%3c 32:42 And Nobah went and took Kenath, and the villages thereof, and%0a%3c called it Nobah, after his own name.%0a%3c %0a%3c 33:1 These are the journeys of the children of Israel, which went%0a%3c forth out of the land of Egypt with their armies under the hand of%0a%3c Moses and Aaron.%0a%3c %0a%3c 33:2 And Moses wrote their goings out according to their journeys by%0a%3c the commandment of the LORD: and these are their journeys according to%0a%3c their goings out.%0a%3c %0a%3c 33:3 And they departed from Rameses in the first month, on the%0a%3c fifteenth day of the first month; on the morrow after the passover the%0a%3c children of Israel went out with an high hand in the sight of all the%0a%3c Egyptians.%0a%3c %0a%3c 33:4 For the Egyptians buried all their firstborn, which the LORD had%0a%3c smitten among them: upon their gods also the LORD executed judgments.%0a%3c %0a%3c 33:5 And the children of Israel removed from Rameses, and pitched in%0a%3c Succoth.%0a%3c %0a%3c 33:6 And they departed from Succoth, and pitched in Etham, which is in%0a%3c the edge of the wilderness.%0a%3c %0a%3c 33:7 And they removed from Etham, and turned again unto Pihahiroth,%0a%3c which is before Baalzephon: and they pitched before Migdol.%0a%3c %0a%3c 33:8 And they departed from before Pihahiroth, and passed through the%0a%3c midst of the sea into the wilderness, and went three days' journey in%0a%3c the wilderness of Etham, and pitched in Marah.%0a%3c %0a%3c 33:9 And they removed from Marah, and came unto Elim: and in Elim were%0a%3c twelve fountains of water, and threescore and ten palm trees;

according to%0a%3c the tribes of your fathers ye shall inherit.%0a%3c %0a%3c 33:55 But if ye will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from%0a%3c before you; then it shall come to pass, that those which ye let remain%0a%3c of them shall be pricks in your eyes, and thorns in your sides, and%0a%3c shall vex you in the land wherein ye dwell.%0a%3c %0a%3c 33:56 Moreover it shall come to pass, that I shall do unto you, as I%0a%3c thought to do unto them.%0a%3c %0a%3c 34:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 34:2 Command the children%0a%3c of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land of Canaan;%0a%3c (this is the land that shall fall unto you for an inheritance, even%0a%3c the land of Canaan with the coasts thereof:) 34:3 Then your south%0a%3c quarter shall be from the wilderness of Zin along by the coast of%0a%3c Edom, and your south border shall be the outmost coast of the salt sea%0a%3c eastward: 34:4 And your border shall turn from the south to the ascent%0a%3c of Akrabbim, and pass on to Zin: and the going forth thereof shall be%0a%3c from the south to Kadeshbarnea, and shall go on to Hazaraddar, and%0a%3c pass on to Azmon: 34:5 And the border shall fetch a compass from Azmon%0a%3c unto the river of Egypt, and the goings out of it shall be at the sea.%0a%3c %0a%3c 34:6 And as for the western border, ye shall even have the great sea%0a%3c for a border: this shall be your west border.%0a%3c %0a%3c 34:7 And this shall be your north border: from the great sea ye shall%0a%3c point out for you mount Hor: 34:8 From mount Hor ye shall point out%0a%3c your border unto the entrance of Hamath; and the goings forth of the%0a%3c border shall be to Zedad: 34:9 And the border shall go on to Ziphron,%0a%3c and the goings out of it shall be at Hazarenan: this shall be your%0a%3c north border.%0a%3c %0a%3c 34:10 And ye shall point out your east border from Hazarenan to%0a%3c Shepham: 34:11 And the coast shall go down from Shepham to Riblah, on%0a%3c the east side of Ain; and the border shall descend, and shall reach%0a%3c unto the side of the sea of Chinnereth eastward: 34:12 And the border%0a%3c shall go down to Jordan, and the goings out of it shall be at the salt%0a%3c sea: this shall be your land with the coasts thereof round about.%0a%3c %0a%3c 34:13 And Moses commanded the children of Israel, saying, This is the%0a%3c land which ye shall inherit by lot, which the LORD commanded to give%0a%3c unto the nine tribes, and to the half tribe: 34:14 For the tribe of%0a%3c the children of Reuben according to the house of their fathers, and%0a%3c the tribe of the children of Gad according to the house of their%0a%3c fathers, have received their inheritance; and half the tribe of%0a%3c Manasseh have received their inheritance: 34:15 The two tribes and the%0a%3c half tribe have received their inheritance on this side Jordan near%0a%3c Jericho eastward, toward the sunrising.%0a%3c %0a%3c 34:16 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 34:17 These are the names%0a%3c of the men which shall divide the land unto you: Eleazar the priest,%0a%3c and Joshua the son of Nun.%0a%3c %0a%3c 34:18 And ye shall take one prince of every tribe, to divide the land%0a%3c by inheritance.%0a%3c %0a%3c 34:19 And the names of the men are these: Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb%0a%3c the son of Jephunneh.%0a%3c %0a%3c 34:20 And of the tribe of the children of Simeon, Shemuel the son of%0a%3c Ammihud.%0a%3c %0a%3c 34:21 Of the tribe of Benjamin, Elidad the son of Chislon.%0a%3c %0a%3c 34:22 And the prince of the tribe of the children of Dan, Bukki the%0a%3c son of Jogli.%0a%3c %0a%3c 34:23 The prince of the children of Joseph, for the tribe of the%0a%3c children of Manasseh, Hanniel the son of Ephod.%0a%3c %0a%3c 34:24 And the prince of the tribe of the children of Ephraim, Kemuel%0a%3c the son of Shiphtan.%0a%3c %0a%3c 34:25 And the prince of the tribe of the children of Zebulun,%0a%3c Elizaphan the son of Parnach.%0a%3c %0a%3c 34:26 And the prince of the tribe of the children of Issachar, Paltiel%0a%3c the son of Azzan.%0a%3c %0a%3c 34:27 And the prince of the tribe of the children of Asher, Ahihud the%0a%3c son of Shelomi.%0a%3c %0a%3c 34:28 And the prince of the tribe of the children of Naphtali, Pedahel%0a%3c the son of Ammihud.%0a%3c %0a%3c 34:29 These are they whom the LORD commanded to divide the inheritance%0a%3c unto the children of Israel in the land of Canaan.%0a%3c %0a%3c 35:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses in the plains of Moab by Jordan%0a%3c near Jericho, saying, 35:2 Command the children of Israel, that they%0a%3c give unto the Levites of the inheritance of their possession cities to%0a%3c dwell in; and ye shall give also unto the Levites suburbs for the%0a%3c cities round about them.%0a%3c %0a%3c 35:3 And the cities shall they have to dwell in; and the suburbs of%0a%3c them shall be for their cattle, and for their goods, and for all their%0a%3c beasts.%0a%3c %0a%3c 35:4 And the suburbs of the cities, which ye shall give unto the%0a%3c Levites, shall reach from the wall of the city and outward a thousand%0a%3c cubits round about.%0a%3c %0a%3c 35:5 And ye shall measure from without the city on the east side two%0a%3c thousand cubits, and on the south side two thousand cubits, and on the%0a%3c west side two thousand cubits, and on the north side two thousand%0a%3c cubits; and the city shall be in the midst: this shall be to them the%0a%3c suburbs of the cities.%0a%3c %0a%3c 35:6 And among the cities which ye shall give unto the Levites there%0a%3c shall be six cities for refuge, which ye shall appoint for the%0a%3c manslayer, that he may flee thither: and to them ye shall add forty%0a%3c and two cities.%0a%3c %0a%3c 35:7 So all the cities which ye shall give to the Levites shall be%0a%3c forty and eight cities: them shall ye give with their suburbs.%0a%3c %0a%3c 35:8 And the cities which ye shall give shall be of the possession of%0a%3c the children of Israel: from them that have many ye shall give many;%0a%3c but from them that have few ye shall give few: every one shall give of%0a%3c his cities unto the Levites according to his inheritance which he%0a%3c inheriteth.%0a%3c %0a%3c 35:9 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 35:10 Speak unto the%0a%3c children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come over Jordan%0a%3c into the land of Canaan; 35:11 Then ye shall appoint you cities to be%0a%3c cities of refuge for you; that the slayer may flee thither, which%0a%3c killeth any person at unawares.%0a%3c %0a%3c 35:12 And they shall be unto you cities for refuge from the avenger;%0a%3c that the manslayer die not, until he stand before the congregation in%0a%3c judgment.%0a%3c %0a%3c 35:13 And of these cities which ye shall give six cities shall ye have%0a%3c for refuge.%0a%3c %0a%3c 35:14 Ye shall give three cities on this side Jordan, and three cities%0a%3c shall ye give in the land of Canaan, which shall be cities of refuge.%0a%3c %0a%3c 35:15 These six cities shall be a refuge, both for the children of%0a%3c Israel, and for the stranger, and for the sojourner among them: that%0a%3c every one that killeth any person unawares may flee thither.%0a%3c %0a%3c 35:16 And if he smite him with an instrument of iron, so that he die,%0a%3c he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.%0a%3c %0a%3c 35:17 And if he smite him with throwing a stone, wherewith he may die,%0a%3c and he die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to%0a%3c death.%0a%3c %0a%3c 35:18 Or if he smite him with an hand weapon of wood, wherewith he may%0a%3c die, and he die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to%0a%3c death.%0a%3c %0a%3c 35:19 The revenger of blood himself shall slay the murderer: when he%0a%3c meeteth him, he shall slay him.%0a%3c %0a%3c 35:20 But if he thrust him of hatred, or hurl at him by laying of%0a%3c wait, that he die; 35:21 Or in enmity smite him with his hand, that he%0a%3c die: he that smote him shall surely be put to death; for he is a%0a%3c murderer: the revenger of blood shall slay the murderer, when he%0a%3c meeteth him.%0a%3c %0a%3c 35:22 But if he thrust him suddenly without enmity, or have cast upon%0a%3c him any thing without laying of wait, 35:23 Or with any stone,%0a%3c wherewith a man may die, seeing him not, and cast it upon him, that he%0a%3c die, and was not his enemy, neither sought his harm: 35:24 Then the%0a%3c congregation shall judge between the slayer and the revenger of blood%0a%3c according to these judgments: 35:25 And the congregation shall deliver%0a%3c the slayer out of the hand of the revenger of blood, and the%0a%3c congregation shall restore him to the city of his refuge, whither he%0a%3c was fled: and he shall abide in it unto the death of the high priest,%0a%3c which was anointed with the holy oil.%0a%3c %0a%3c 35:26 But if the slayer shall at any time come without the border of%0a%3c the city of his refuge, whither he was fled; 35:27 And the revenger of%0a%3c blood find him without the borders of the city of his refuge, and the%0a%3c revenger of blood kill the slayer; he shall not be guilty of blood:%0a%3c 35:28 Because he should have remained in the city of his refuge until%0a%3c the death of the high priest: but after the death of the high priest%0a%3c the slayer shall return into the land of his possession.%0a%3c %0a%3c 35:29 So these things shall be for a statute of judgment unto you%0a%3c throughout your generations in all your dwellings.%0a%3c %0a%3c 35:30 Whoso killeth any person, the murderer shall be put to death by%0a%3c the mouth of witnesses: but one witness shall not testify against any%0a%3c person to cause him to die.%0a%3c %0a%3c 35:31 Moreover ye shall take no satisfaction for the life of a%0a%3c murderer, which is guilty of death: but he shall be surely put to%0a%3c death.%0a%3c %0a%3c 35:32 And ye shall take no satisfaction for him that is fled to the%0a%3c city of his refuge, that he should come again to dwell in the land,%0a%3c until the death of the priest.%0a%3c %0a%3c 35:33 So ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye are: for blood it%0a%3c defileth the land: and the land cannot be cleansed of the blood that%0a%3c is shed therein, but by the blood of him that shed it.%0a%3c %0a%3c 35:34 Defile not therefore the land which ye shall inhabit, wherein I%0a%3c dwell: for I the LORD dwell among the children of Israel.%0a%3c %0a%3c 36:1 And the chief fathers of the families of the children of Gilead,%0a%3c the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of the sons of%0a%3c Joseph, came near, and spake before Moses, and before the princes, the%0a%3c chief fathers of the children of Israel: 36:2 And they said, The LORD%0a%3c commanded my lord to give the land for an inheritance by lot to the%0a%3c children of Israel: and my lord was commanded by the LORD to give the%0a%3c inheritance of Zelophehad our brother unto his daughters.%0a%3c %0a%3c 36:3 And if they be married to any of the sons of the other tribes of%0a%3c the children of Israel, then shall their inheritance be taken from the%0a%3c inheritance of our fathers, and shall be put to the inheritance of the%0a%3c tribe whereunto they are received: so shall it be taken from the lot%0a%3c of our inheritance.%0a%3c %0a%3c 36:4 And when the jubile of the children of Israel shall be, then%0a%3c shall their inheritance be put unto the inheritance of the tribe%0a%3c whereunto they are received: so shall their inheritance be taken away%0a%3c from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers.%0a%3c %0a%3c 36:5 And Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word%0a%3c of the LORD, saying, The tribe of the sons of Joseph hath said well.%0a%3c %0a%3c 36:6 This is the thing which the LORD doth command concerning the%0a%3c daughters of Zelophehad, saying, Let them marry to whom they think%0a%3c best; only to the family of the tribe of their father shall they%0a%3c marry.%0a%3c %0a%3c 36:7 So shall not the inheritance of the children of Israel remove%0a%3c from tribe to tribe: for every one of the children of Israel shall%0a%3c keep himself to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers.%0a%3c %0a%3c 36:8 And every daughter, that possesseth an inheritance in any tribe%0a%3c of the children of Israel, shall be wife unto one of the family of the%0a%3c tribe of her father, that the children of Israel may enjoy every man%0a%3c the inheritance of his fathers.%0a%3c %0a%3c 36:9 Neither shall the inheritance remove from one tribe to another%0a%3c tribe; but every one of the tribes of the children of Israel shall%0a%3c keep himself to his own inheritance.%0a%3c %0a%3c 36:10 Even as the LORD commanded Moses, so did the daughters of%0a%3c Zelophehad: 36:11 For Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and%0a%3c Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, were married unto their father's%0a%3c brothers' sons: 36:12 And they were married into the families of the%0a%3c sons of Manasseh the son of Joseph, and their inheritance remained in%0a%3c the tribe of the family of their father.%0a%3c %0a%3c 36:13 These are the commandments and the judgments, which the LORD%0a%3c commanded by the hand of Moses unto the children of Israel in the%0a%3c plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho.%0a\ No newline at end of file%0a
