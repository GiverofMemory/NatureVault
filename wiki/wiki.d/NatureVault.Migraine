csum=Chronic [[acne]] under skin [[ https://permanentheadache.blogspot.com/2011/11/day-1060-propolis.html|#]], showing possible immune deficit.  !!!My message [[https://permanentheadache.blogspot.com/2014/06/day-1990-chiropractic.html#comment-form|#]]  [@Hello!  I think you will want to read this.  I read every post you made and then have been thinking about this for a few days.  First I will say that I wish you posted the supps that your docs had you on.  I'm going to guess that selenium, zinc, Magnesium, vitamin D, B12 were in there.  I also would recommend riboflavin, vit e, vit k, and Retinol.   Now I'm sure you still want to know what is causing your headache but you also have tons of people piping up and making a fool of themselves.  Well I don't think I am going to do that.  But first I want to say that somehow your kinesiologist seems to have honed in on the truth.  To gently lead you in to what you have let me just say that I stumbled on this blog after searching for wormwood migraine.  This happened because my hypothesis was based on my understanding is that wormwood would help with them.  I think you have a pretty common type of migrane that just never went away.  I also suffer it slightly and mine is a 0-1/10 and is on about 50%25 of the time.  But I only got it when I started treating my head with diluted essential oils for parasites for a couple weeks straight because I felt crawling sensations, now I have semi-constant mild migraine.

You have either onchocerca or wuchereria.  Often times you can get both.  Thing about both of them if you do some searching on refseek.com, they are VERY hard to detect.  in the Oncho case it doesn't even put out microfilariae in the blood (or any bodily fluid).  The only way I was 100%25 sure that I had it is that I got poison ivy and it caused my body to start fighting them causing swelling and skin depigmentation and the like.%0a%0aAnyway the anti-parasite method is the way to go.  In addition to the wormwood and black walnut, I would add elecampane, paud'arco, and something like ginseng for onchocerca.  Oncho can cause your vision to fog as it dies off and what I do is a tiny drop of neat cinnamon or cassia essential oil around the eye socket (but not too close to the eye!).  Also dilute essential oil caused my worm to go into my temple nerve from my scalp but I find neat cinnamon/cassia will kill worms, I treated a knee with it for a week or two and all crawling sensations stopped.  Starting that on my scalp near my temple now.%0a%0aAnyway I hope you see this as one of the more promising and logical leads you have to a cause.  Good luck and God bless!@]
