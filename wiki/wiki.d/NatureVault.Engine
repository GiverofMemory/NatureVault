This was caused by the apex seals on the triangular rotor juddering instead of sliding smoothly against inner casing. This scoring led to poor seal durability, and caused other automotive manufacturers to quit. Mazda’s engineers, led by Kenichi Yamamoto, eventually not only solved the problem with a graphite-aluminium alloy seal, but also cured other drawbacks, such as excessive oil consumption and a lack of low-end torque [[https://www.mazda.com/en/innovation/mazda-stories/mazda/rotary_revolution/|#]]
