PLINIUS  SECUNDUS. %0a%0a%0aThe  Description  of  Africa. %0a%0aFRICA  the  Greeks  have  called  Lybia;  from %0awhich  the  Lybian  Sea  before  it  beginneth,  and %0aendeth  in  the  Egyptian.  No  part  of  the  Earth %0areceiveth  fewer  Gulfs  in  that  long  compass  of %0aoblique  Coasts  from  the  West.  The  Names %0aof  its  People  and  Towns  are  exceedingly  hard %0a%0ato  be  Pronounced,  unless  by  their  own  Tongues  :  and  again, %0a%0athey  for  the  most  part  dwell  in  Castles. %0a%0a%0aCHAPTER  I. %0aMauritania. %0a%0aAT  the  beginning,  the  Lands  of  Mauritania,  until  the %0atime  of  C.  Ccesar  (i.  e.  Caligula),  son  of  Germanicus,  were %0acalled  Kingdoms :  but  by  his  Cruelty  it  was  divided  into  two %0aProvinces.  The  utmost  Promontory  of  the  Ocean  is  named %0aby  the  Greeks  Ampelusia.  The  Towns  were  Lissa  and  Cotes %0a%0a%0a46  History  of  Nature.  [BooK  V. %0a%0abeyond  the  Pillars  of  Hercules.  Now  there  is  Tingi,  formerly %0abuilt  by  Antceus ;  and  afterwards  by  Claudius  Ccesar,  when  he %0amade  it  a  Colony,  by  whom  it  was  called  Traducta  Julia.  It %0ais  from  Belone,  a  Town  in  Baetica,  by  the  nearest  Passage,  30 %0aMiles.  Five-and-Twenty  Miles  from  it,  in  the  Coast  of  the %0aOcean,  is  a  Colony  of  Augustus,  now  Julia  Constantia,  exempt %0afrom  the  Jurisdiction  of  the  Kings  of  Zilis  :  and  commanded %0ato  seek  for  Law  to  Baetica.  And  32  Miles  from  it  is  Lixos, %0amade  a  Colony  by  Claudius  Caesar,  of  which  in  old  Time  there %0awere  related  many  Fabulous  Tales.  There  stood  the  Royal %0aPalace  of  Antceus ;  there  was  the  combat  with  Hercules  ;  there %0aalso  were  the  Gardens  of  the  Hesperides.  Now  there  floweth %0ainto  it  out  of  the  Sea  a  Creek  by  a  winding  Channel,  in %0awhich  Men  now  interpret  that  there  were  Dragons  serving %0aas  Guards.  It  encloseth  an  Island  within  itself,  which  (not- %0awithstanding the  Tract  near  it  is  somewhat  higher)  is  alone %0anot  overflowed  by  the  Tides  of  the  Sea.  In  it  there  standeth %0aan  Altar  of  Hercules ;  and  except  wild  Olives,  nothing  is  to %0abe  seen  of  that  Grove,  reported  to  bear  Golden  Apples. %0aAnd  indeed  less  may  they  wonder  at  the  enormous  lies  of %0aGreece  invented  concerning  these,  and  the  River  Lixus  ; %0awho  will  think  how  of  late  our  Countrymen  have  delivered %0asome  Fables  scarcely  less  monstrous,  regarding  the  same %0athings  :  as,  that  this  is  a  very  strong  City,  bigger  than  great %0aCarthage :  moreover,  that  it  is  situated  over  against  it,  and %0aalmost  at  an  immense  way  from  Tingi :  and  other  such, %0awhich  Cornelius  Nepos  hath  been  very  eager  to  believe. %0aFrom  Lixus  40  Miles,  in  the  Midland  Parts,  standeth  Babba, %0aanother  Colony  of  Augustus,  called  Julia  Campestris  :  also %0aa  third  75  Miles  off,  called  Banasa,  but  now  Valentia. %0a35  Miles  from  it  is  the  Town  Volubile,  just  in  the  midway %0abetween  both  Seas.  But  in  the  Coast,  50  Miles  from  Lixus, %0athere  runneth  Subur,  a  copious  and  navigable  River,  near  to %0athe  Colony  Banasa.  As  many  Miles  from  it  is  the  Town %0aSala,  standing  upon  a  River  of  the  same  Name,  near  now  to %0athe  Wilderness,  much  infested  with  Herds  of  Elephants,  but %0amuch  more  with  the  Nation  of  the  Autololes,  through %0awhich  lieth  the  Way  to  Atlas,  the  most  fabulous  Mountain  of %0a%0a%0aBooKV.]  History  of  Nature.  47 %0a%0aAfrica.  For  Writers  have  given  out  that,  rising  out  of  the %0avery  midst  of  the  Sands,  it  rnounteth  to  the  Sky,  rough  and %0aill-favoured  on  that  side  which  lieth  toward  the  Shore  of  the %0aOcean,  unto  which  it  gave  the  Denomination  :  and  the  same %0ais  shadowy,  full  of  Woods,  and  watered  with  Sources  of %0aspouting  Springs,  on  the  way  which  looketh  to  Africa,  with %0aFruits  of  all  sorts,  springing  of  their  own  accord,  one  under %0aanother,  in  such  a  manner,  that  at  no  time  is  Fulness  of  Plea- %0asure wanting.  Moreover,  that  none  of  the  Inhabitants  are %0aseen  by  day  :  all  is  silent,  like  the  Awe  of  Solitude  :  a  secret %0aDevotion  creepeth  into  the  Hearts  of  those  who  approach %0anear  to  it;  and  besides  this  Awe  they  are  lifted  above  the %0aClouds,  even  close  to  the  Circle  of  the  Moon  :  that  the  same %0a(Mountain)  shineth  by  Night  with  frequent  Fires,  and  is %0afilled  with  the  Lasciviousness  of  jÂ£gi  panes  and  Satyrs  ;  that  it %0aresoundeth  with  the  Melody  of  Flutes  and  Pipes ;  and %0aringeth  with  the  Sound  of  Drums  and  Cymbals.  These  are %0athe  Reports  of  famous  Writers,  besides  the  Labours  of %0aHercules  and  Perseus  there.  The  Way  unto  it  is  exceedingly %0along,  and  not  certainly  known.  There  were  also  Com- %0amentaries of  Hanno,  the  General  of  the  Carthaginians,  who %0ain  the  time  of  the  most  flourishing  state  of  Carthage  had  a %0acharge  to  explore  the  Circuit  of  Africa.  Him,  most  of  the %0aGreeks  as  well  as  our  Countrymen  following,  among  some %0aother  fabulous  Stories,  have  written  that  he  also  built  many %0aCities  there  :  but  neither  any  Memorial,  nor  Token  of  them %0aremain.  When  Scipio  jSZmylianus  carried  on  War  in  Africa, %0aPolybius,  the  Writer  of  the  Annals,  received  from  him  a  Fleet ; %0aand  having  sailed  about  for  the  purpose  of  searching  into  that %0apart  of  the  World,  he  reported,  That  from  the  said  Mountain %0aWest,  toward  the  Forests  full  of  Wild  Beasts,  which  Africa %0abreedeth,  to  the  River  Anatis,  are  485  Miles ;  and  from %0athence  to  Lixus,  205.  Agrippa  saith,  That  Lixus  is  distant %0afrom  the  Straits  of  Gades  112  Miles.  Then,  that  there  is  a %0aBay  called  Saguti;  also  a  Town  upon  the  Promontory, %0aMutelacha.  Rivers,  Subur  and  Sala.  That  the  Port %0aRutubis  is  from  Lixus  313  Miles.  Then  the  Promontory %0aof  the  Sun.

Then  a  Bay  of  516  Miles,  enclosed  within  the  Promon- %0atory of  the  Mountain  Barce,  running  out  into  the  West,  which %0ais  called  Surrentium .  After  it,  the  River  Palsus,  beyond  which %0aare  the  ^Ethiopian  Perorsi,  and  at  their  back  are  the  Pharusi. %0aUpon  whom  join  the  inland  People,  the  Geetuli  Darae.  But %0aupon  the  Coast  are  the  ^Ethiopian  Daratitee ;  the  River %0aBambotus  full  of  Crocodiles  and  Hippopotami.  From  which, %0ahe  saith,  there  is  a  Continuation  of  Mountains  as  far  as  to %0athat  which  we  call  Theon-Ochema  (the  Gods'  Chariot). %0aThen,  in  sailing  nine  Days  and  Nights  to  the  Promontory %0aHesperium,  he  hath  placed  the  Mountain  Atlas  in  the  mid- %0away ;  which  by  all  other  Writers  is  set  down  to  be  in  the %0autmost  Borders  of  Mauritania.  The  Romans  first  warred  in %0aMauritania,  in  the  time  of  Claudius  the  Prince :  when %0aJEdcemon,  the  Freedman  of  King  Ptolemceus,  who  was %0aslain  by  C.  Ccesar,  endeavoured  to  avenge  his  Death.  For %0aas  the  Barbarians  fled  backward,  the  Romans  came  to  the %0aMountain  Atlas.  And  not  only  to  such  Generals  as  had %0abeen  Consuls,  and  to  such  as  were  of  the  Senate,  who  at  that %0atime  managed  affairs,  but  to  Knights  also,  who  from  that %0atime  had  command  there,  was  it  a  glory  to  have  pene- %0atrated to  the  Atlas.  *Five  Roman  Colonies,  as  we  have %0asaid,  are  in  that  Province,  and  by  common  fame  it  may  seem %0ato  be  accessible.  But  this  is  found  for  the  most  part  by %0aExperience  very  fallacious  :  because  Persons  of  high  Rank, %0awhen  it  is  irksome  to  search  out  the  Truth,  find  it  not  irk- %0asome through  the  shame  of  Ignorance,  to  give  out  Untruths  : %0aand  never  are  Men  more  credulous  to  be  deceived  than  when %0asome  grave  Author  fathereth  the  lie.  And  indeed  I  less %0awonder,  that  things  are  not  known,  when  they  of  the  Eques- %0atrian Order,  and  those  now  also  of  the  Senatorial  Rank, %0aadmire  nothing  but  Luxury:  which  very  powerful  and  pre- %0availing Force  is  seen  when  Forests  are  searched  for  Ivory  and %0aCitron-trees :  and  all  the  Rocks  in  Getulia  for  Murices  and %0a%0a*  It  seemeth  that  this  clause  is  to  be  set  in  the  beginning  of  the  next %0achapter. %0a%0a%0aBOOK  V.]  History  of  Nature.  49 %0a%0aPurpurae.  Nevertheless  the  natural  Inhabitants  report,  That %0ain  the  Sea-coast  150  Miles  from  Sala  there  is  the  River %0aAsana,  that  receiveth  Salt  Water  into  it,  but  with  a  goodly %0aHarbour :  and  not  far  from  it  a  River,  which  they  call  Fut : %0afrom  which  to  Dyris  (for  that  is  the  Name  in  their  Language %0aof  Atlas)  are  200  Miles,  with  a  River  coming  between, %0anamed  Vior.  And  there,  by  report,  are  to  be  seen  the  cer- %0atain tokens  of  a  Soil  formerly  inhabited ;  the  vestiges  of %0aVineyards  and  Date-tree  Groves.  Suetonius  Paulinus  (a %0aConsul  in  our  time),  who  was  the  first  Roman  Leader  that %0apassed  over  Atlas  for  the  space  of  some  Miles,  also  hath  re- %0aported regarding  the  height  thereof:  and  moreover,  that  the %0afoot  of  it  toward  the  bottom  is  full  of  thick  and  tall  Woods, %0awith  Trees  of  an  unknown  kind,  but  the  height  of  them  is %0adelightful  to  see,  smooth  and  beautiful,  the  branches  like %0aCypress  ;  and,  besides  the  strong  smell,  are  covered  over %0awith  a  thin  Down,  of  which  (with  some  help  of  Art)  fine %0aCloth  may  be  made,  such  as  the  Silk-worm  yieldeth :  that %0athe  top  of  it  is  covered  with  deep  Snow,  even  in  Summer, %0aand  that  he  reached  up  to  it  on  the  tenth  day,  and  beyond  to %0athe  River  called  Niger,  through  solitudes  of  black  Dust, %0awith  sometimes  conspicuous  ragged  Rocks,  appearing  as  if %0aburnt :  places  by  reason  of  the  Heat  not  habitable,  although %0atried  in  the  Winter  Season.  Those  who  dwelt  in  the  next %0aForests  were  pestered  with  Elephants,  wild  Beasts,  and %0aSerpents  of  all  sorts  ;  and  those  People  were  called  Canarii ; %0abecause  they  and  Animals  feed  together,  and  part  among %0athem  the  Bowels  of  wild  Beasts.  For  it  is  sufficiently %0aknown  that  a  Nation  of  ^Ethiopians,  whom  they  call  Peroresi, %0ajoineth  to  them.  Juba,  the  Father  of  Ptolemceus,  who  for- %0amerly ruled  over  both  Mauritania,  a  Man  more  memorable %0afor  his  illustrious  Studies  than  for  his  Kingdom,  hath  written %0athe  like  concerning  Atlas ;  and  (he  saith)  moreover,  that %0athere  is  an  Herb  growing  there  called  Euphorbia,  from  his %0aPhysician's  name  that  first  found  it:  the  Milky  Juice  of %0awhich  he  praiseth  exceedingly  much  for  clearing  the  Eyes %0aand  against  Serpents  and  all  Poisons,  in  a  dedicated  Book  by %0aitself.  Thus  much  may  suffice,  if  not  too  much,  about  Atlas. %0a%0aVOL.  II.  E %0a%0a%0a50  History  of  Nature.  [BooK  V. %0a%0ay  CHAPTER  II. %0a%0aThe  Province  Tingitania. %0a%0aTHE  Length  of  the  Province  Tingitania  is  170  Miles.  The %0aNations  therein  are  these :  The  Mauri,  which  in  times  past %0awas  the  principal,  and  of  whom  the  Province  took  its  Name : %0aand  those  most  Writers  have  called  Marusii.  Being  by  War %0aweakened,  they  wasted  to  a  few  Families.  Next  to  them %0awere  the  Masssesuli,  hut  in  like  manner  they  were  extin- %0aguished. Now  are  the  Nations  inhabited  by  the  Getulae, %0aBannurri,  and  the  Autololes,  the  most  powerful  of  all :  a %0apart  of  whom  were  once  the  Vesuni :  but  being  divided  from %0athem,  they  became  a  Nation  by  themselves,  and  were  turned %0ato  the  ./Ethiopians.  This  Province  being  full  of  Mountains %0aeastward,  affordeth  Elephants.  In  the  Mountain  Abila, %0aalso,  and  in  those  which  for  their  equal  height  they  call %0athe  Seven  Brethren :  these  are  joined  to  Abila,  which  looketh %0aover  the  arm  of  the  Sea.  From  these  beginneth  the  Coast  of %0athe  Inward  Sea.  The  River  Tamuda  navigable,  and  for- %0amerly a  Town.  The  River  Laud,  which  also  is  able  to %0areceive  Vessels.  The  Town  Rusardir,  and  the  Harbour. %0aThe  navigable  River  Malvana.  The  Town  Siga,  over %0aagainst  Malacha,  situated  in  Hispania  :  the  royal  Seat  of %0aSyphax,  and  now  the  other  Mauritania.  For  a  long  time  they %0akept  the  names  of  the  Kings,  so  that  the  furthest  was  called %0aBogadiana:  and  likewise  Bocchi,  which  now  is  Caesariensis. %0aNext  to  it  is  the  Harbour  for  its  space  called  Magnus,  with  a %0aTown  of  Roman  Citizens.  The  River  Muluca,  which  is  the %0alimit  of  Bocchi  and  the  Massaesuli.  Quiza  Xeriitana,  a  Town %0aof  Strangers  :  Arsennaria,  a  Town  of  Latins,  3  Miles  from  the %0aSea :  Carcenna,  a  Colony  of  Augustus,  the  Second  Legion  : %0aLikewise  another  Colony  of  his,  planted  with  the  Pretorian %0aCohort :  Gunugi :  and  the  Promontory  of  Apollo.  And  a %0amost  famous  Town  there,  Caesarea,  usually  in  old  time  called %0alol,  the  royal  Seat  of  King  Juba :  endowed  by  Divus  Clau- %0adius with  the  Right  of  a  Colony,  by  whose  Appointment  the %0aold  Soldiers  were  there  bestowed.  A  new  Town,  Tipasa, %0a%0a%0aBOOK  V.]  History  of  Nature.  51 %0a%0awith  the  Liberties  of  Latium.  Likewise  Icosium,  endowed %0aby  Vespasian  the  Emperor  with  the  same  Gift.  The  Colony %0aof  Augustus,  Rusconiae:  and  Ruscurum,  by  Claudius  honoured %0aas  a  City  :  Rusoezus,  a  Colony  of  Augustus.  Salde,  a  Colony %0aof  the  same.  Igelgili  also,  and  Turca,  a  Town  seated  upon %0athe  Sea  and  the  River  Ampsaga.  Within  Land,  the  Colony %0aAugusta,  the  same  as  Succubar ;  and  likewise  Tubrisuptus. %0aCities,  Timici,  Tigavse.  Rivers,  Sardabala  and  Nabar.  The %0aNation,  Macurebi :  the  River  Usar  and  the  Nation  of  the %0aNabades.  The  River  Ampsaga  is  from  Caesarea  233 %0aMiles.  The  Length  of  either  Mauritania  is  839  Miles,  the %0aBreadth,  467. %0a%0aCHAPTER  III. %0aNumidia. %0a%0aNEXT  to  Ampsaga  is  Numidia,  renowned  for  the  Name  of %0aMasanissa:  called  by  the  Greeks,  the  Land  Metagonitis. %0aThe  Numidian  Nomades  (so  named  from  changing  their  Pas- %0ature), who  carry  their  Huts,  that  is,  their  Houses,  about  with %0athem  upon  Waggons.  Their  Towns  are  Cullu  and  Rusicade  ; %0afrom  which  48  Miles  off,  within  the  midland  Parts  is  the %0aColony  Cirta,  surnamed  of  the  Sittiani ;  another  also  within %0aCicca,  and  a  free  Town  named  Bulla  Regia.  But  in  the  Coast, %0aTacatua,  Hippo  Regius,  and  the  River  Armua.  The  Town %0aTrabacha,  of  Roman  Citizens  :  the  River  Tusca,  which %0aboundeth  Numidia :  and  besides  the  Numidian  Marble,  and %0aabundance  of  wild  Beasts,  nothing  is  there  worth  the %0anoting. %0a%0aCHAPTER  IV. %0aAfrica. %0a%0aFROM  Tusca  forward  is  the  Region  Zeugitana,  and  the %0aCountry  properly  called  Africa.  Three  Promontories  :  the %0aWhite ;  then  that  of  Apollo,  over  against  Sardinia:  that  of  Mer- %0acury opposite  to  Sicily  ;  which,  running  into  the  Sea,  make %0atwo  Bays :  the  one  Hipponensis,  next  to  the  Town  which %0athey  call  Hipponis,  named  by  the  Greeks  Diarrhyton,  on %0a%0a%0a52  History  of  Nature.  [BooK  V. %0a%0aaccount  of  Brooks  of  Water :  upon  this  bordereth  Theudalis, %0aan  exempt  Town,  but  further  from  the  Sea-side  ;  then  the %0aPromontory  of  Apollo.  And  in  the  other  Bay,  Utica,  of %0aRoman  Citizens,  ennobled  by  the  death  of  Cato :  the  River %0aBagrada.  A  Place  called  Castra  Cornelia  :  and  the  Colony %0aCarthago,  among  the  Relics  of  great  Carthage:  and  the %0aColony  Maxulla.  Towns,  Carpi,  Misna,  and  the  free  Clupea, %0aupon  the  Promontory  of  Mercury.  Also,  free  Towns,  Cu- %0arubis  and  Neapolis.  Soon  is  another  distinction  of  Africa %0aitself.  Libyphoenices  are  they  called,  who  inhabit  Byzacium  ; %0afor  so  is  that  Region  named :  containing  in  Circuit  250  Miles, %0aexceedingly  fertile,  where  the  Ground  sown  yieldeth  to  the %0aHusbandman  an  hundred-fold  Increase.  In  it  are  free  Towns, %0aLeptis,  Adrumetum,  Ruspina,  and  Thapsus :  then,  Thense, %0aMacomades,  Tacape,  Sabrata,  reaching  to  the  Lesser  Syrtis  : %0aunto  which,  the  Length  of  Numidia  and  Africa  from  Am- %0aphaga  is  580  Miles  :  the  Breadth,  of  so  much  as  is  known, %0a200.  This  Part,  which  we  have  called  Africa,  is  divided  into %0atwo  Provinces,  the  old  and  the  new  ;  separated  by  a  Fosse %0abrought  as  far  as  to  Thense,  within  the  African  Gulf;  which %0aTown  is  217  Miles  from  Carthage.  The  third  Bay  is  sepa- %0arated into  two ;  horrible  Places  for  the  Shallows  and  ebbing %0aand  flowing  of  the  Sea  at  the  two  Syrtes.  From  Carthage %0ato  the  nearer  of  them,  which  is  the  lesser,  is  300  Miles,  by %0athe  Account  of  Polybius :  who  saith,  also,  that  the  said  Pas- %0asage of  Syrtis  is  100  Miles  forward  and  300  in  Circuit.  By %0aLand  also,  the  Way  to  it  is  by  observation  of  the  Stars,  and %0athrough  the  Desert  over  Sands  and  through  Places  full  of %0aSerpents  ;  you  pass  Forests  filled  with  Numbers  of  wild %0aBeasts  :  and  within,  Solitudes  of  Elephants  :  and  soon  after, %0avast  Deserts,  even  beyond  the  Garamantes,  who,  from  the %0aAugilae,  are  distant  twelve  Days'  Journey.  Above  them  was %0athe  Nation  of  the  Psylli :  and  above  them  the  Lake  of  Lyco- %0amedes  environed  with  Deserts.  The  Augilee  themselves  are %0aseated  about  the  middle  Way  from  Ethiopia  ;  which  bendeth %0aWestward,  and  from  the  Country  lying  between  the  two %0aSyrtes,  with  an  equal  Distance  on  each  Side  :  but  the  Shore %0abetween  the  two  Syrtes  is  250  Miles.  There  standeth  the %0a%0a%0aBOOK  V.]  History  of  Nature.  53 %0a%0aCity  Oeensis,  the  River  Cinyps,  and  the  Country.  Towns, %0aNeapolis,  Taphra,  Abrotonum,  the  other  Leptis,  called  also %0athe  Great.  Then  the  Greater  Syrtis,  in  Compass  625  Miles, %0aand  in  direct  Passage  313.  Then  inhabit  the  Nation  of  Cisi- %0apades.  In  the  inmost  Gulf  was  the  Coast  of  the  Lotophagi, %0awhom  some  have  called  Alachroas,  as  far  as  to  the  Altars  of %0athe  Philaeni,  and  they  are  formed  of  Sand.  Next  to  them,  not %0afar  from  the  Continent,  the  vast  Marsh  admitteth  into  it  the %0aRiver  Triton,  and  taketh  its  Name  from  it :  but  CaUimachus %0acalleth  it  Pallantias,  and  saith  it  is  on  this  Side  the  lesser %0aSyrtes  ;  but  many  place  it  between  both  Syrtes.  The  Pro- %0amontory that  encloseth  the  greater  is  named  Borion.  Beyond %0ais  the  Province  Cyrenaica.  From  the  River  Ampsaga  to  this %0aBound,  Africa  containeth  26  separate  People,  who  are  subject %0ato  the  Roman  Empire :  among  which  are  six  Colonies,  be- %0asides the  above-named,  Uthina  and  Tuburbis.

Berenice  standeth  upon  the  outermost  Horn %0aof  Syrtis,  called  formerly  the  City  of  the  above-named  Hes- %0aperides,  according  to  the  wandering  Tales  of  Greece.  And %0abefore  the  Town,  not  far  off,  is  the  River  Lethon,  the  sacred %0aGrove  where  the  Gardens  of  the  Hesperides  are  reported  to %0abe.  From  Leptis  it  is  385  Miles.  From  it  is  Arsinoe,  usually %0anamed  Teuchira,  43  Miles :  and  from  thence  22  Miles, %0aPtolemais,  called  in  old  time  Barce.  And  then  250  Miles %0aoff,  the  Promontory  Phycus  runneth  out  through  the  Cretic %0aSea,  distant  from  Tsenarus,  a  Promontory  of  Laconia,  350 %0aMiles  :  but  from  Greta  itself  125  Miles.  And  after  it  Gyrene, %0a1 1  Miles  from  the  Sea.  From  Phycus  to  Apollonia  is  24 %0aMiles:  to  Cherrhonesus,  88:  and  so  to  Catabathnus,  216 %0aMiles.  The  Inhabitants  there  bordering  are  the  Marmaridse, %0astretching  out  in  Length  almost  from  Parse  to  mum  to  the %0aGreater  Syrtis.  After  them  the  Ararauceles  :  and  so  in  the %0avery  Coast  of  Syrtis,  the  Nesamones,  whom  formerly  the %0aGreeks  called  Mesammones,  by  reason  of  the  Place,  as %0aseated  in  the  midst  between  the  Sands.  The  Cyrenaic %0aCountry,  for  the  Space  of  15  Miles  from  the  Sea-shore,  is %0afruitful  for  Trees :  and  for  the  same  Compass  within  the %0aLand,  for  Corn  only:  but  then  for  30  Miles  in  Breadth,  and %0a250  in  Length,  for  Laser.1  After  the  Nasamones  live  the %0aHasbitae  and  Masse.  Beyond  them  the  Hammanientes,  11 %0aDays'  Journey  from  the  Greater  Syrtis  to  the  West ;  and  even %0athey  also  every  Way  are  compassed  about  with  Sands :  but %0a%0a1  The  plant  that  yielded  the  Cyrenaic  juice  called  Laser,  was  the %0aSilphion  of  the  Greeks,  and  the  Laserpitium  of  the  Romans  (Thapsia %0aSilphion,  Viviani),  and  agrees  tolerably  well  with  the  rude  figures  struck %0aon  the  Cyrenean  coins.  It  would  appear,  however,  that  the  Cyrenaic %0ajuice  becoming  scarce,  the  ancients  employed  some  other  substance  of %0asimilar,  though  inferior  properties,  as  a  substitute,  and  to  both  of  them %0athey  applied  the  term  Laser.  Pliny  (lib.  xix.  c.  3)  says,  "  For  a  long %0atime  past  the  only  Laser  brought  to  us  is  that  which  is  produced  abun- %0adantly in  Persia,  &c.,  but  it  is  inferior  to  the  Cyrenaic."  Now  it  is  not  at %0aall  improbable  that  the  Laser  of  Persia  may  have  been  our  Asafcedita %0a(Ferula  Asafa>dita,  LIN.)  â  Wern.

Next  to %0athese  is  a  Mountain,  reaching  a  great  way  from  East  to %0aWest,  called  by  our  People  Ater,  as  if  burnt  by  Nature,  or %0ascorched  by  the  reflection  of  the  Sun.  Beyond  that  Moun- %0atain are  the  Deserts :  also  Matelgse,  a  Town  of  the  Gara- %0amantes,  and  likewise  Debris,  which  casteth  forth  a  Fountain, %0athe  Waters  boiling  from  Noon  to  Midnight,  and  for  as  many %0aHours  to  Mid-day  reducing  again :  also  the  very  illustrious %0aTown  Garama,  the  head  of  the  Garamantes.

The %0afairest  is  Meninx,  35  Miles  long  and  25  broad,  called  by %0aEratosthenes  Lotophagitis.  It  hath  two  Towns,  Meninx  on %0athe  side  of  Africa,  and  Thoar  on  the  other :  itself  is  situated %0afrom  the  right-hand  Promontory  of  the  Lesser  Syrtis  200 %0aPaces.1  A  hundred  Miles  from  it  against  the  left  hand  is %0aCercina,  with  a  free  Town  of  the  same  Name,  in  Length  25 %0aMiles,  and  half  as  much  in  Breadth  where  it  is  most :  but %0atoward  the  end  not  above  five  Miles.  To  it  there  lieth  a %0alittle  one  toward  Carthage  called  Cercinitis,  and  it  joineth %0aby  a  Bridge.  From  these,  almost  50  Miles,  lieth  Lopadusa, %0asix  Miles  long.

Above  them  are  the  Ethiopian %0aNations  :  the  Nigritae,  from  whom  the  River  was  named  :  the %0aGyrnnetes,  Pharusi,  and  those  which  now  reach  to  the  Ocean, %0awhom  we  spake  of  in  the  border  of  Mauritania  :  the  Perorsi. %0aFrom  all  these  are  vast  Solitudes  eastward,  to  the  Gara- %0amantes,  Augylse,  and  Troglodites,  according  to  the  truest %0aopinion  of  them  who  place  two  ^Ethiopias  above  the  Deserts %0aof  Africa :  and  especially  of  Homer,  who  saith,  that  the %0aEthiopians  are  divided  two  ways,  towards  the  East  and %0a%0a1  Or  1500  paces,  i.  e.  a  mile  and  a  half. %0a%0a%0a58  History  of  Nature.

The  River  Niger  is  of  the  same  nature  as  Nilus ; %0aproducing  the  Reed  and  Papyrus,  and  the  same  living  Crea- %0atures, and  swelleth  at  the  same  Seasons.  It  springeth  be- %0atween the  Tareleia  jEthiopiae,  and  the  Oecalicae.  The  Town %0aMavin,  belonging  to  this  People,  some  have  set  upon  the %0adeserts  :  near  them  the  Atlantae ;  the  jEgipanae,  half  beasts  ; %0athe  Blemmyae,  the  Gamphasantae,  Satyri,  and  Himantopodae. %0aThose  Atlantae,  if  we  will  believe  it,  degenerate  from  Human %0aManners :  for  neither  call  they  one  another  by  any  Name  : %0aand  they  look  upon  the  Sun,  rising  and  setting,  with  dread- %0aful curses,  as  being  pernicious  to  them  and  their  Fields  : %0aneither  Dream  they  in  their  Sleep,  as  other  Men.  The %0aTroglodites  dig  Caverns,  and  these  serve  them  for  Houses : %0athey  feed  upon  the  Flesh  of  Serpents ;  they  make  a  gnash- %0aing Noise,  not  a  Voice,  so  little  exchange  have  they  of  Speech. %0aThe  Garamantes  live  out  of  Marriage,  and  converse  with %0atheir  Women  in  common.  The  Augylae  only  worship  the %0aInfernal  Gods.  The  Gamphasantes  are  naked,  and  know  no %0aWars,  and  associate  with  no  Foreigner.  The  Blemmyae,  by %0areport,  have  no  Heads,  but  their  Mouth  and  Eyes  fixed  in %0atheir  Breast.  The  Satyri,  besides  their  Shape,  have  nothing %0aof  Human  Manners.  The  jEgipauae  are  shaped  as  you  see %0athem  commonly  painted.  The  Himantopodae  are  some  of %0athem  wry-legged,  with  which  they  naturally  go  creeping. %0aThe  Pharusi,  formerly  Persae,  are  said  to  have  been  the %0aCompanions  of  Hercules,  as  he  went  to  the  Hesperides. %0aMore  of  Africa  worth  the  noting  does  not  occur.1 %0a%0aCHAPTER  IX. %0aOf  Asia. %0a%0aUNTO  it  joineth  Asia,  which  from  the  Mouth  of  Canopus %0aunto  the  Mouth  of  Pontus,  according  to  Timosthenes,  is  2639 %0aMiles.

The  next  Country  to  Africa  that  is %0ainhabited  is  Egypt,  receding  withinward  to  the  South,  so %0afar  as  to  the  ^Ethiopians,  who  are  stretched  out  on  its  Back. %0aThe  Nilus  is  on  the  lower  part,  and  is  divided  on  the  Right %0a'and  Left;  by  its  encircling  it.boundeth  it  with  the  Mouth %0aof  Canopus  from  Africa,  and  with  the  Pelusiac  from  Asia, %0awith  an  interval  of  170  Miles.  For  which  cause,  some  have %0areckoned  Egypt  among  the  Islands,  considering  that  Nilus %0adoth  so  divide  itself  as  to  make  a  triangular  figure  of  the %0aLand.  And  so,  many  have  called  Egypt  by  the  Name  of  the %0aGreek  letter  Delta  (A).  The  Measure  of  it  from  the  Channel %0awhere  it  is  single,  from  whence  it  first  parteth  into  sides,  to %0athe  Mouth  of  Canopus,  is  146  Miles  ;  and  to  the  Pelusiac  256. %0aThe  upmost  part  bounding  upon  ^Ethiopia,  is  called  Thebais. %0aIt  is  divided  into  Townships,  with  separate  Jurisdictions, %0awhich  they  call  Nomi :  as  Ombites,  Phatunites,  Apol- %0alopolites,  Hermonthites,  Thinites,  Phanturites,  Captites, %0aTentyrites,  Diospalites,  Antaeopolites,  Aphroditopolites,  and %0aLycopolites.

There  are  two  Arsinoetes;  they  and %0aMemphites  reach  as  far  as  to  the  Head  of  Delta.  Upon  it  there %0aborder,  out  of  Africa,  the  two  Ouasitae.

[BOOK  V. %0a%0amade  it :  72  Miles  from  thence  is  Memphis,  the  Castle  in %0aold  time  of  the  Egyptian  Kings.  From  which  to  the %0aOracle  of  Hammon  is  12  Days'  Journey  ;  and  to  the  Division %0aof  Nilus,  which  we  have  called  Delta,  15  Miles.  The  Nilus, %0arising  from  unknown  Springs,  passeth  through  Deserts  and %0aburning  Countries:  and  going  a  vast  way  in  Length,  is %0aknown  by  Fame  only,  without  Arms,  without  Wars,  which %0ahave  discovered  all  other  Lands.  It  hath  its  beginning,  so %0afar  as  King  Juba  was  able  to  search,  in  a  Mountain  of  the %0alower  Mauritania,  not  far  from  the  Ocean,  near  to  a  stag- %0anant Lake,  which  they  call  Nilides.  In  it  are  found  the %0aFishes  called  Alabetae,1  Coracini,  Siluri,  and  also  the  Cro- %0acodile. Upon  this  argument  the  Nilus  is  thought  to  spring %0afrom  hence,  for  that  it  is  seen  dedicated  by  him  at  Csesarea, %0ain  Iseum,  at  this  day.  Moreover,  it  is  observed,  that  as  the %0aSnow  or  Rain  fills  the  Country  in  Mauritania,  so  the  Nilus %0aincreases.  When  it  is  run  out  of  this  Lake,  it  scorneth %0ato  pass  through  the  sandy  and  unclean  Places,  and  hideth %0aitself  for  some  Days'  Journey.  By  and  by  out  of  another %0agreater  Lake  it  breaketh  forth  in  the  Country  of  the  Mas- %0assesyli,  of  Mauritania  Csesariensis  ;  and  as  if  it  looks  about  for %0athe  Company  of  Men,  with  the  same  arguments  of  living %0aCreatures,  again  becomes  received  within  the  Sands,  where %0ait  is  hidden  a  second  time  for  20  Days'  Journey  in  the %0aDeserts,  as  far  as  to  the  next  ^Ethiopse :  and  so  soon  as  it %0ahath  again  espied  a  Man,  forth  it  leapeth  (as  it  should  seem) %0aout  of  that  Spring,  which  they  called  Nigris.  And  then %0adividing  Africa  from  ^Ethiopia,  being  acquainted,  if  not  pre- %0asently with  people,  yet  with  the  frequent  company  of  wild  and %0asavage  Beasts,  and  creating  the  shade  of  Woods,  it  cutteth %0a%0a1  The  first  named,  Alabes  or  Alabetse,  is  a  species  of  Lota  of  Cuvier, %0aor  Burbot :  though  perhaps  not  the  same  with  the  fish  of  that  name  that %0ainhabits  the  fresh  waters  of  Europe.  The  name  Coracinus  has  been %0aapplied  to  more  than,  one  fish  of  a  sooty  colour :  but  the  species  referred %0ato  by  Pliny  is  probably  the  Perca  Nilotica  of  Linnaeus :  the  Lates  Nilo- %0aticus  of  Cuvier.  The  Silurus  of  Pliny  is  perhaps  a  species  of  Cuvier's %0agenus  Schilbe,  although  true  Siluri  are  found  in  the  Nile.

And  even  so  was  it  formerly %0anamed  Siris  for  many  Miles:  and  by  Homer  altogether %0ajEgyptus :  by  others,  Triton :  here  and  there  hitting  upon %0aIslands,  and  stirred  with  so  many  Provocations :  and  at  the %0alast  enclosed  within  Mountains :  and  in  no  place  is  it  more  a %0aTorrent,  while  the  Water  that  it  beareth  hasteneth  to  a %0aPlace  of  the  .ZEthiopii  called  Catadupi,  where  in  the  last %0aCataract  among  the  opposing  Rocks  it  is  supposed  not  to %0arun,  but  to  rush  down  with  a  mighty  Noise.  But  afterwards %0ait  becometh  gentle,  as  the  Stream  is  broken  and  the  violence %0asubdued  and  partly  wearied  with  his  long  way :  and  so, %0athough  with  many  Mouths,  it  dischargeth  itself  into  the %0aEgyptian  Sea.  Nevertheless,  on  certain  Days  it  swelleth %0ato  a  great  height :  and  when  it  hath  travelled  through  all %0aEgypt,  it  overfloweth  the  Land,  to  its  great  Fertility.  Dif- %0aferent causes  of  this  Increase  have  been  given  :  but  those %0awhich  carry  the  most  probability  are  either  the  rebounding %0aof  the  Water  driven  back  by  the  Etesian  Winds,  at  that  time %0ablowing  against  it,  and  driving  the  Sea  upon  the  Mouths  of %0athe  River :  or  the  Summer  Rain  in  ^Ethiopia,  by  reason %0athat  the  same  Etesian  Winds  bring  Clouds  thither  from %0aother  parts  of  the  World.  Timceus  the  Mathematician %0aalleged  an  hidden  reason  for  it,  which  is,  that  the  Foun- %0atain of  the  Nilus  is  named  Phiala,  and  the  River  itself  is %0ahidden  within  Trenches  under  the  Ground,  breathing  forth %0ain  a  Vapour  out  of  reeking  Rocks,  where  it  lieth  concealed. %0aBut  so  soon  as  the  Sun  during  those  Days  cometh  near,  it  is %0a%0a%0a62  History  of  Nature.

And  this  happeneth  from  the  rising  of  the  Dog %0athrough  the  Sun's  entrance  into  Leo,  while  the  Star  standeth %0aperpendicularly  over  the  Fountain  :  when  in  that  Tract  there %0aare  no  Shadows  to  be  seen.  Many  again  were  of  a  different %0aOpinion :  that  a  River  floweth  more  abundantly  when  the %0aSun  is  departed  toward  the  North  Pole,  which  happeneth  in %0aCancer  and  Leo,  and  therefore  at  that  time  it  is  not  so  easily %0adried :  but  when  it  is  returned  again  toward  Capricorn  and %0athe  South  Pole,  it  is  drunk  up,  and  therefore  floweth  more %0asparily.  But  if,  according  to  Timceus,  it  would  be  thought %0apossible  that  the  Water  should  be  drawn  up,  the  want  of %0aShadows  during  those  Days,  and  in  those  Places,  continueth %0astill  without  end.

And  when  he  is  entered %0ainto  Virgo  it  falleth  in  the  same  measure  as  it  rose  before. %0aAnd  it  is  altogether  brought  within  its  banks  in  Libra,  as %0aHerodotus  thinketh,  by  the  hundredth  day.

The  Towns %0aEpiphania  and  Antiochia  have  the  River  running  close  to %0athem,  and  they  are  called  Euphrates.  Zeugma  likewise, %0a72  Miles  from  Samosatse,  is  ennobled  by  the  Passage  over %0aEuphrates  :  for  it  is  joined  to  Apamia,  over  against  it,  by  a %0aBridge,  built  by  Seleucus  the  Founder  of  both.  The  People %0athat  join  to  Mesopotamia  are  called  Rhoali.  But  the  Towns %0aof  Syria  are  Europum ;  Thapsacum,  formerly,  now  Amphi- %0apolis;  Arabian  Scsenitse.

Arid  as  if  shut  out  by  Nature  from %0aall  other  Lands,  it  is  by  a  peculiar  lot  between  two  mighty %0aEmpires,  the  Romans  and  the  Parthians ;  wherein  Dis- %0acord is  ever  the  first  object  on  both  Sides.  It  is  distant %0afrom  Seleucia  of  the  Parthians,  which  is  called,  on  the %0aTigris,  537  Miles  :  and  from  the  nearest  Coast  of  Syria,  252  : %0aand  from  Damascus,  27  nearer. %0a%0aCHAPTER  XXVI. %0aHierapolis. %0a%0aBENEATH  the  Solitudes  of  Palmyra,  lieth  the  Country %0aStelendena,2  wherein  are  the  Cities  named  at  this  Day %0aHierapolis,  Beroea,  and  Chalcis.  Beyond  Palmyra  also, %0aHeinesa  taketh  up  some  part  of  those  Deserts :  and  likewise %0aElutium,  nearer  to  Petra  by  one-half  than  is  Damascus. %0aAnd  next  to  Astura  standeth  Philiscum,  a  Town  of  the  Par- %0athians, on  Euphrates.  From  which  by  Water  it  is  a  Journey %0a%0a1  We  are  at  a  loss  to  account  for  the  praise  bestowed  on  the  site  of %0aPalmyra,  situated  as  it  is  on  the  borders  of  a  vast  wilderness ;  it  can  only %0abe  from  comparison  with  the  surrounding  sterility,  and  the  supply  of %0awater  obtained  here,  which  is  so  rare  a  blessing  in  the  sandy  plains  of  the %0aEast.    The  country  does  not  appear  to  have  undergone  any  change  from %0athe  period  of  the  foundation  of  this  ancient  city,  until  now  ;  Tadmor  (its %0aoriginal  name)  was  built  by  king  Solomon,  probably  for  the  purpose  of %0acutting  off  all  commerce  between  the  Syrians  and  Mesopotamians,  and  it %0arose  into  note  in  consequence.    In  later  times  it  was  also  much  frequented %0aby  the  caravans  of  Persia  and  the  countries  beyond. â  Wern.

There  is  given  a  Tetrarchy  out  of %0aLycaonia,  on  that  side  that  bordereth  upon  Galatia:  to %0awhich  belong  14  Cities,  whereof  the  most  celebrated  is  Ico- %0anium. In  Lycaonia  itself,  those  of  celebrity  are  Tembasa %0aupon  Taurus,  Sinda  in  the  Confines  of  Galatia  and  Cappa- %0adocia.

It  retireth,  therefore,  toward  the  North,  fetching  a %0agreat  Circuit,  and  so  making  way,  as  if  the  Industry  of %0aNature  continually  opposed  the  Seas  against  it;  on  one  side %0athe  Phoenician  Sea,  on  another  the  Sea  of  Pontus ;  here  the %0aCaspian  and  Hyrcanian  Seas,  and  full  against  him  the  Lake %0aMceotis.  And  notwithstanding  these  Bars,  within  which  it %0ais  pent  and  entwined,  yet  at  last  Conqueror ;  it  winds  away %0aand  passeth  on  until  it  encounters  its  kindred  Riphaean %0aMountains :  and  wherever  it  goeth,  it  is  distinguished  by  a %0aNumber  of  new  Names.  For  in  the  Beginning  of  its  Course %0ait  is  called  Imaus  :  a  little  forward  Emodus,  Paropamisus, %0aCircius,  Camibades,  Parphariades,  Choatras,  Oreges,  Oro- %0aandes,  Niphates,  Taurus  ;  and  where  it  is  predominant,  Cau- %0acasus ;  where  it  stretcheth  forth  its  Arms,  as  if  now  and  then %0aendeavouring  toward  the  Seas,  it  taketh  the  Name  Sarpedon, %0aCoracesius,  and  Cragus ;  and  then  again  Taurus,  even  where %0ait  gapeth,  and  opening  itself  to  the  People.  And  yet  it %0aclaimeth  its  Unity  still,  and  (these  Passages  are  called)  by %0athe  Names  of  Gates ;  as  in  one  Place  Armenise,  in  another %0aCaspise,  and  again  Cilicise.  And  besides  being  broken  into %0aParcels,  and  escaped  far  from  the  Sea,  it  taketh  here  and %0athere  many  Names  of  Nations  ;  as,  on  the  right  Hand  Hyr- %0acanus  and  Caspius  ;  on  the  left,  Pariedrus,  Moschicus, %0aAmazonicus,  Coraxicus,  and  Scythicus.  And  throughout  all %0aGreece,  Ceraunius. %0a%0aTo  return  to  Lycia,  beyond  its  Promontory,  is  the  Town %0aSimena,  the  Mountain  Chimsera,  emitting  Flames  by  Night; %0athe  City  Hephsestium,  where  the  Hills  likewise  oftentimes %0aare  known  to  burn.

There  is  Pinara  ;  and  Telmessus,  that  boundeth %0aLycia.  In  ancient  Time  Lycia  possessed  threescore  Towns, %0abut  now  36;  of  which  the  most  celebrated,  besides  the  above- %0anamed,  are  Canae,  Candyba,  where  the  Wood  Oenium  is %0apraised  ;  Podalia,  Choma  upon  the  River  Adesa,  Cyane, %0aAscandalis,  Amelas,  Noscopium,  Tlos,  and  Telanorus.  It %0acontaineth  in  the  midland  Parts  Chabalia,  with  three  Towns %0athereto  belonging :  Oenonda,  Balbura,  and  Bubon. %0a%0aBeyond  Telmessus  is  the  Asiatic  Sea,  otherwise  called %0aCarpathium,  and  the  Country  which  is  properly  called  Asia. %0aAgrippa  hath  divided  it  into  two  Parts,  of  which  the  one  by %0ahis  Description  boundeth  Phrygia  and  Lycaonia,  eastward  : %0abut  on  the  West  Side  it  is  limited  by  the  JEgean  Sea. %0aSouthward  it  boundeth  upon  Egypt:  and  in  the  North  upon %0aPaphlagonia.  The  Length  thereof  by  his  Computation  is %0a470  Miles,  the  Breadth  300.  The  other  he  hath  limited %0aEastward  from  Armenia  the  Less:  Westward  by  Phrygia, %0aLycaonia,  and  Pamphylia;  on  the  North  by  the  Province  of %0aPontus ;  and  on  the  South  by  the  Pamphylian  Sea  :  it  con- %0ataineth 575  Miles  in  Length,  and  325  in  Breadth.

This %0aCity  was  first  called  Diospolis,  and  afterwards  Rhoas.  The %0aother  Nations  belonging  to  that  Jurisdiction  worth  the  Nam- %0aing are  the  Hydrelitae,  Themisones,  and  Hierapolitse.

A  third  (Jurisdiction) %0agoeth  to  Apamia,  which  in  old  Time  was  called  Celsense,  and %0aafterwards  Ciboton.  It  is  situated  at  the  Foot  of  the  Moun- %0a%0a1  Laodicea,  so  named  in  honour  of  Laodice,  wife  of  Antiochus  II.,  by %0awhom  the  city  was  enlarged.  From  all  accounts  it  appears  to  have  been %0abuilt  on  a  volcanic  hill,  and  boasted,  in  its  prosperity,  many  public  build- %0aings of  note,  of  which  the  remains  of  an  aqueduct  and  amphitheatre  are %0astill  to  be  seen. %0a%0aEphesus  was  the  capital  of  Proconsular  Asia,  and  was  situated  in  Ionia %0a(now  Natolia),  about  five  miles  from  the  .ZEgean  Sea,  on  the  sides  and %0aat  the  foot  of  a  range  of  mountains  overlooking  a  fine  plain  watered  and %0afertilised  by  the  river  Cayster.  The  city  was  celebrated  for  the  Temple %0aof  Diana,  a  most  magnificent  edifice,  erected  at  the  common  expense %0aof  the  inhabitants  of  Asia  Proper,  and  described  by  Pliny,  b.  xxxvi.  c.  14, %0abut  of  which  the  site  is  now  unknown.  Ephesus  was  finally  overthrown %0ain  tbe  fourteenth  century,  after  continued  struggles.

To  this  (City)  were  annexed  by  Alexander %0athe  Great,  six  Towns:  Theangela,  Sibde,  Medmossa,  Eura- %0anium,  Pedasium,  and  Telmessum.

In  the  same  Tract  also  stood  Maeandropolis.  There %0ais  Eumenia  close  by  the  River  Cludrus ;  the  River  Glaucus  ; %0athe  Town  Lysias  and  Orthasia.  The  Tract  of  Berecinthus, %0aNysa,  Trallis,  which  also  is  named  Euanthia,  and  Seleucia, %0aand  Antiochia.  It  is  washed  by  the  River  Eudone,  and %0aThebanis  passeth  through  it.

The  River  Maeander  issueth  out  of  a  Lake  in  the %0aMountain  Aulocrene ;  and  passing  by  many  Towns,  and %0afilled  with  Abundance  of  Rivers,  it  fetcheth  such  windings %0ato  and  fro,  that  oftentimes  it  is  thought  to  run  backward %0aagain.  The  first  Country  it  passeth  through  is  Apamia  :  and %0apresently  Eumenitica,  and  so  through  the  Plains  Bargyl- %0aletici.

Be- %0asides these,  there  lie  about  Rhodus,  Cyclopis,  Teganon,  Cor- %0adylusa,  four  under  the  Name  of  Diabete :  Hymos,  Chalcis, %0awith  a  Town  :  Seutlusa,  Narthecusa,  Dimastos,  and  Progne. %0aBeyond  Gnidos,  Cicerussa,  Therionarce,  Calydne  with  three %0aTowns,  Notium,  Nisyrus,  Mendeterus :  and  in  Arconesus, %0athe  Town  Ceramus.  Upon  the  Coast  of  Caria,  the  Islands, %0atwenty  in  number,  called  Argiae :  and  Hyetussa,  Lepsia,  and %0aLeros.  But  the  most  noble  in  that  Bay  is  Cos,  which  is  dis- %0atant from  Halicarnassus  15  Miles ;  and  in  Compass  100,  as %0amany  judge;  called  Merope,  as  Staphylus  saith  :  but  accord- %0aing to  Dionysius,  Cos  Meropis :  and  afterwards  Nymphaea. %0aThere  is  the  Mountain  Prion :  and  as  they  think,  Nysiris %0abroken  off;  formerly  named  Porphyris.  Beyond  this, %0aCarianda,  with  a  Town :  and  not  far  from  Halicarnassus, %0aPidosus.  Moreover,  in  the  Gulf  Ceramicus,  Priaponnesus, %0aHipponesus,  Psyra,  Mya,  Lampsemandus,  Passala,  Crusa, %0aPyrrhe,  Sepiussa,  Melano ;  and  within  a  short  Distance  of %0athe  Continent,  another  called  Cinedopolis,  from  the  shameful %0aPersons  that  King  Alexander  left  there.  The  Coast  of  Ionia %0ahath  (the  Islands)  ./Egeae  and  Corsese,  besides  Icaros,  spoken %0aof  before.  Also  Lade,  formerly  called  Latse :  and  among %0asome  others  of  no  worth,  the  two  Camelides  near  to  Miletus. %0aMycalenum,  Trogylise,  Trepsilion,  Argennon,  Sardalion : %0aand  the  free  Samos,  which  in  Circuit  is  fourscore  and  seven %0aMiles;  or  as  Isidorus  thinketh,  100.  Aristotle  writeth, %0athat  at  first  it  was  called  Parrhania,  afterwards  Dryusa,  and %0athen  Anthemusa.  Aristocritus  giveth  it  other  Names,  as %0aMelamphyllus,  and  afterward  Cyparissia :  others  term  it %0aPartheno-arusa,  and  Stephane.  Rivers  in  it,  Imbrasus, %0aChesius,  arid  Ibettes  :  Fountains,  Gigarto  and  Leucothea : %0athe  Mountain  Cercetius.  There  lie  adjoining  to  it  the %0aIslands  Rhypara,  Nymphaea,  arid  Achillea.  Fourscore  and %0athirteen  Miles  from  it,  is  Chios,  free,  with  a  Town  ;  which %0aIsland  is  as  renowned  as  Samos.  jEphorus  by  the  ancient %0aName  calleth  it  ^Ethalia :  Metrodorus  and  Cleobulus,  Chia, %0afrom  the  Nymph  Chio.  Others  suppose  it  was  so  called %0a%0a%0aBOOK  V.]  History  of  Nature.  93 %0a%0afrom  Chion,  i.e.  Snow  :  and  some  would  have  it  to  be  Ma- %0acris  and  Pityusa.  It  has  a  Mountain  called  Pellenaeus,  the %0aMarble  called  Chium.  Ancient  Geographers  have  written, %0athat  it  is  125  Miles  in  Circuit ;  and  Isidorus  addeth  nine %0amore.  It  is  situated  between  Samos  and  Lesbos,  for  the  most %0apart  opposite  to  Erythrse.  Near  it  lieth  Thallusa,  which  some %0awrite  Dapnusa,  (Enussa,  Elaphites,  Euryanassa,  Arginussa %0awith  a  Town.  Now  all  these  are  about  Ephesus,  as  also %0athose  called  of  Pisistratus :  and  the  Anthinae,  Myonnesus,  and %0aDiareusa.  In  both  these  the  Towns  are  lost.

But  among  the  illustrious  is  Teos,  in  the %0adeep  Sea,  with  a  Town :  distant  from  Chios  fourscore  and %0aone  Miles,  and  as  much  from  Erythrae.  Near  Smyrna  are %0athe  Peristerides,  Carteria,  Alopece,  Elseussa,  Bachina,  Pys- %0atira,  Crommyonnesus,  and  Megale.  Before  Troas,  the  Asca- %0aniae,  and  three  Plateae.  Then  the  Lainiae,  and  two  Plitaniae ; %0aPlate,  Scopelos,  Getone,  Artheidon,  Celae,  Lagussae,  and %0aDidymae.  But  the  most  illustrious  is  Lesbos,  which  is  from %0aChios  threescore  and  five  Miles.  It  was  called  Hemerte,  and %0aLasia,  Pelasgia,  J^gira,  Mihyope,  and  Macaria :  famous  for %0aeight  Towns ;  of  which  Pyrrha  is  swallowed  up  by  the  Sea : %0aand  Arisb&  is  overthrown  by  an  Earthquake.  Methymna %0awas  peopled  from  Antissa,  which  was  united  to  it,  and  in  it %0awere  eight  Cities,  and  it  is  about  seven-and-thirty  Miles  from %0aAsia.1  Also  Agamede  and  Hiera  have  perished.  There %0aremain  Eresos,  Pyrrha,  and  the  free  Mitylenae,  which  hath %0acontinued  powerful  for  500  Years.  Isidorus  saith,  that  this %0aIsland  is  in  Circuit  173  Miles  :  but  the  old  Geographers,  195. %0aIn  it  are  these  Mountains,  Lepethymus,  Ordymnus,  Macistus, %0aCreon,  and  Olympus.  It  is  distant  eight  Miles  and  a  half  from %0athe  Continent,  where  it  lieth  nearest.  Islands  near  it,  Sauda- %0alion,  and  the  five  Leucae.

Outside  the  Helles- %0apont, over-against  the  Sigean  Coast,  lieth  the  Isle  Tenedus, %0acalled  sometimes  Leucophrys,  Phoenice,  and  Lyrnessos. %0aFrom  Lesbos  it  is  six-and-fifty  Miles,  and  from  Sigaeum %0atwelve  Miles  and  a  half. %0a%0aCHAPTER  XXXII. %0a%0aHellespontus,  Mysia,  Phrygia,   Galatia,  Bithynia, %0aBosporus. %0a%0aTHE  Hellespont  then  assumeth  its  Violence  and  over- %0acometh  the  Sea,  digging  a  Way  with  its  Eddies,  until  it  hath %0atorn  away  Asia  from  Europe.  That  Promontory  we  have %0anamed  Trapeza,  ten  Miles  beyond  which  stancleth  the  Town %0aAbydum,  where  the  Straits  are  seven  Stadia  over.  Be- %0ayond it  is  the  Town  Percote,  and  Lampsacum,  called  for- %0amerly Pityusa :  the  Colony  Parium,  which  Homer  called %0aAdrastia.  The  Town  Priapos,  the  River  JEsepus,  Zelia, %0aPropontus ;  as  the  Place  is  called  where  the  Sea  enlargeth %0aitself.  The  River  Granicum,  the  Harbour  Artace,  where %0aonce  stood  a  Town.  Beyond  it  is  an  Island,  which  Alexander %0ajoined  to  the  Continent,  in  which  standeth  the  Town  Cyzi- %0acum,  founded  by  the  Milesians,  called  heretofore  Arconne- %0asos;  Dolionis,  and  Dindymis,  near  the  Top  of  which  is  the %0aMountain  Dindymus.  Presently  the  Towns  Placia,  Aviacos, %0aScylacÂ£ :  and  behind  them,  the  Mountain  Olympus,  called %0aMsesius.  The  City  Olympena.  The  Rivers  Horisius  and %0aRhyndacus,  formerly  named  Lycus.  This  River  taketh  its %0aBeginning  in  the  Lake  Artynia,  near  to  Miletopolis.  It %0areceiveth  the  Marestos  and  many  others  ;  and  separateth %0aAsia  from  Bithynia.  This  Region  was  called  Cronia  :  after- %0award Thessalis,  then  Malianda  and  Strymonis.  These  (Na- %0ations) Homer  named  Halizones,  because  they  are  environed %0awith  the  Sea.  There  was  a  very  great  City  named  Attusa. %0aAt  this  Day  there  are  fifteen  Cities,  among  which  is  Gordiu- %0acome,  now  called  Juliopolis ;  and  on  the  Coasts  Dascylos. %0aThen  the  River  Gebes  :  and  within-land,  the  Town  Helgas, %0a%0a%0aBooKV.]  History  of  Nature.  95 %0a%0athe  same  as  Germanicopolis,  known  also  Ity  another  Name %0aBooscoete,  as  also  Apamea,  now  called  Myrtea  of  the  Colo- %0aphonians.  The  River  Etheleum,  the  ancient  limit  of  Troas, %0aand  where  Mysia  beginneth.  Afterwards  the  Gulf  into %0awhich  runneth  the  River  Ascanium,  the  Town  Bryllion. %0aThe  Rivers  Hylas  and  Cios,  with  a  Town  of  that  Name  : %0awhich  was  a  Place  of  Trade,  not  far  off  from  the  Inhabitants %0aof  Phrygia,  and  built  by  the  Milesians  in  a  Place  called  As- %0acania  of  Phrygia.  And  therefore  we  cannot  do  better  than %0ahere  to  speak  of  that  Country.  Phrygia  spreadeth  out  above %0aTroas  and  the  Nations  before  named,  from  the  Promontory %0aLectus  unto  the  River  Etheleus.  It  bordereth  on  the %0aNorth  upon  part  of  Galatia,  southward  it  boundeth  on  Ly- %0acaonia,  Pisidia,  and  Mygdonia ;  and  on  the  east  it  reacheth %0ato  Cappadocia.  The  most  celebrated  Towns  besides  those %0abefore  spoken  of,  are  Ancyra,  Andria,  Celsense,  Colossae,  Ca- %0arina,  Cotiaion,  Ceranse,  Iconium,  and  Midaion.  Certain %0aAuthors  write,  that  out  of  Europe  have  passed  over  the %0aMysi,  Bryges,  and  Thyni,  from  whom  are  named  the  Mysi, %0aPhryges,  and  Bithyni. %0a%0aAt  the  same  time  I  think  it  good  to  write  also  of  Galatia, %0awhich  lying  higher  than  Phrygia,  possesseth  a  greater  part  of %0aits  plain  Country,  and  the  former  Capital  of  it,  called  Gordium. %0aThey  who  inhabited  that  Quarter  were  sprung  from  the  Gauls, %0aand  were  called  Tolistobogi,  Voturi,  and  Ambitui :  but  they %0athat  occupied  the  Country  of  Mseonia  and  Paphlagonia  were %0anamed  Trocmi.  Cappadocia  is  spread  along  from  the  North %0aand  East ;  and  the  most  plenteous  Tract  thereof  the  Tecto- %0asages  and  Teutobodiaci  kept  in  their  Possession.  And  thus %0amuch  for  these  Nations.  The  People  and  Tetrarchies  are  in %0aall  a  hundred  and  ninety  and  five.  The  Towns:  of  the %0aTectosages,  Ancyra  :  of  the  Trocmi,  Tavium  :  of  the  Tolisto- %0abogians,  Pesinus.  Besides  these,  there  are  celebrated  the %0aAttalenses,  Arasenses,  Cotnenses,  Dios-Hieronitse,  Lystreni, %0aNeapolitani,  Oeandenses,  Seleucenses,  Sebasteni,  Timmonia- %0acenses,  and  Tebaseni.  Galatia  extendeth  to  Gabalia  and %0aMilyae  in  Pamphylia;  which  are  situated  about  Baris :  also %0aCyllanticum  and  Oroandicum,  a  Tract  of  Pisidia  :  likewise %0a%0a%0a96  History  of  Nature.

Now  to %0aspeak  of  what  remains  on  the  Sea-coast :  inward  from  Cios %0ais  Prusa  within  Bithynia ;  founded  by  Annibal  beneath %0aOlympus.  From  Prusa  to  Nicsea,  five-and-twenty  Miles ; %0athe  Lake  Ascanius  lying  between.  Then  Nicsea,  in  the  out- %0amost part  of  the  Gulf  Ascanium,  which  before  was  called %0aOlbia:  also  to  another  Prusa,  undÂ«r  the  Mountain  Hippius. %0aThere  were  Pythopolis,  Parthenopolis,  and  Choryphanta. %0aNow  there  are  upon  the  Sea-side  the  Rivers,  .ZEsius,  Bryazon, %0aPlataneus,  Areus,  Siros,  Gendos,  named  also  Chrysorrhoas. %0aThe  Promontory  on  which  stood  the  Town  Megaricum.  Then %0athe  Gulf  which  was  called  Craspedites  ;  because  that  Town %0astood  as  it  were  in  a  Fold  of  it,  There  was  also  the  Town %0aAstacum,  from  which  the  Bay  took  the  Name  of  Astacenus. %0aThere  was  also  the  Town  Libyssa,  where  now  remaineth %0anothing  but  the  Tomb  of  Annibal.  In  the  inmost  part  of %0athe  Gulf  is  the  very  handsome  Town  of  Bithynia,  called %0aNicomedia.  The  Promontory  Leucatas  which  encloseth  the %0aBay  of  Astarenus,  is  from  Nicomedia  forty-two  Miles  and %0aa  half.  Being  past  this  Bay,  the  opposite  Shores  approach- %0aing together,  the  Straits  reach  as  far  as  to  the  Thracian  Bos- %0aphorus.  Upon  these  Straits  standeth  the  Free  (City)  Chalce- %0adon,  seventy-two  Miles  and  a  half  from  Nicomedia.  Formerly %0ait  was  called  Procerastis :  then,  Compusa  :  afterwards,  the %0aCity  of  the  Blind ;  because  they  who  founded  it  were  so %0aignorant  as  not  to  give  a  preference  to  a  Place  seven  Stadia %0afrom  Byzantium,  so  much  more  favourable  in  every  respect. %0aBut  within-land,  in  Bithynia,  is  the  Colony  Apamena :  also, %0athe  Agrippenses,  Juliopolitae,  and  they  of  Bithynium.  The %0aRivers,  Syrium,  Lapsias,  Pharmicas,  Alces,  Crynis,  Lylaeus, %0aScopius,  Hieras,  which  parteth  Bithynia  from  Galatia.  Be- %0ayond Chalcedon,  stood  Chrysopolis:  then,  Nicopolis,  of %0awhich  the  Gulf  still  retaineth  the  Name :  wherein  is  the %0aPort  of  Amycus :  the  Promontory  Naulochum  :  Estia, %0awherein  is  the  Temple  of  Neptune;  and  the  Bosphorus, %0ahalf-a-mile  over,  which  now  again  parteth  Asia  from  Europe. %0a%0a%0aBOOK  V.]  History  of  Nature.  97 %0a%0aFrom  Chalcedon,  it  is  twelve  Miles  and  a  half.  There  begin %0athej  narrow  Straits,  where  it  is  eight  Miles  and  a  quarter %0aover:  where  stood  the  Town  Philopolis.  All  the  Coasts %0aare  inhabited  by  the  Thyni,  but  the  Inland  Parts  by %0athe  Bithyni.  This  is  the  end  of  Asia,  and  of  282  Nations, %0awhich  are  reckoned  from  the  Gulf  of  Lycia  to  this  place. %0aThe  Space  of  the  Hellespont  and  Propontis  to  the  Thracian %0aBosphorus  containeth  in  Length  188  Miles,  as  we  have %0abefore  said.  From  Chalcedon  to  Sigeum,  by  the  computa- %0ation of  Isidorus,  it  is  372  Miles  and  a  half.  Islands  lying  in %0aPropontis  before  Cyzicum  are  these;  Elaphonnesus,  from %0awhence  cometh  the  Cyzicen  Marble ;  and  the  same  Isle  was %0acalled  Neuris,  and  Proconnesus.  Then  follow  Ophiiisa, %0aAcanthus,  Phoebe,  Scopelos,  Porphyrione,  and  Halone,  with %0aa  Town.  Delphacia,  Polydora  :  Artaceeon,  with  the  Town. %0aAnd  over-against  Nicomedia,  is  Demonnesos :  likewise,  be- %0ayond Heraclea,  over-against  Bithynia,  is  Thynnias,  which %0athe  Barbarians  call  Bithynia.  There  is  also  Antiochia  :  and %0aopposite  to  the  narrow  Straits  of  llhyndacus,  Besbicos, %0aeighteen  Miles  in  Circuit.

Five-and-Twenty  Miles  from  it,  in  the  Coast  of  the %0a%3c Ocean,  is  a  Colony  of  Augustus,  now  Julia  Constantia,  exempt %0a%3c from  the  Jurisdiction  of  the  Kings  of  Zilis  :  and  commanded %0a%3c to  seek  for  Law  to  Baetica.  And  32  Miles  from  it  is  Lixos, %0a%3c made  a  Colony  by  Claudius  Caesar,  of  which  in  old  Time  there %0a%3c were  related  many  Fabulous  Tales.  There  stood  the  Royal %0a%3c Palace  of  Antceus ;  there  was  the  combat  with  Hercules  ;  there %0a%3c also  were  the  Gardens  of  the  Hesperides.  Now  there  floweth %0a%3c into  it  out  of  the  Sea  a  Creek  by  a  winding  Channel,  in %0a%3c which  Men  now  interpret  that  there  were  Dragons  serving %0a%3c as  Guards.  It  encloseth  an  Island  within  itself,  which  (not- %0a%3c withstanding the  Tract  near  it  is  somewhat  higher)  is  alone %0a%3c not  overflowed  by  the  Tides  of  the  Sea.  In  it  there  standeth %0a%3c an  Altar  of  Hercules ;  and  except  wild  Olives,  nothing  is  to %0a%3c be  seen  of  that  Grove,  reported  to  bear  Golden  Apples. %0a%3c And  indeed  less  may  they  wonder  at  the  enormous  lies  of %0a%3c Greece  invented  concerning  these,  and  the  River  Lixus  ; %0a%3c who  will  think  how  of  late  our  Countrymen  have  delivered %0a%3c some  Fables  scarcely  less  monstrous,  regarding  the  same %0a%3c things  :  as,  that  this  is  a  very  strong  City,  bigger  than  great %0a%3c Carthage :  moreover,  that  it  is  situated  over  against  it,  and %0a%3c almost  at  an  immense  way  from  Tingi :  and  other  such, %0a%3c which  Cornelius  Nepos  hath  been  very  eager  to  believe. %0a%3c From  Lixus  40  Miles,  in  the  Midland  Parts,  standeth  Babba, %0a%3c another  Colony  of  Augustus,  called  Julia  Campestris  :  also %0a%3c a  third  75  Miles  off,  called  Banasa,  but  now  Valentia. %0a%3c 35  Miles  from  it  is  the  Town  Volubile,  just  in  the  midway %0a%3c between  both  Seas.  But  in  the  Coast,  50  Miles  from  Lixus, %0a%3c there  runneth  Subur,  a  copious  and  navigable  River,  near  to %0a%3c the  Colony  Banasa.  As  many  Miles  from  it  is  the  Town %0a%3c Sala,  standing  upon  a  River  of  the  same  Name,  near  now  to %0a%3c the  Wilderness,  much  infested  with  Herds  of  Elephants,  but %0a%3c much  more  with  the  Nation  of  the  Autololes,  through %0a%3c which  lieth  the  Way  to  Atlas,  the  most  fabulous  Mountain  of %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BooKV.]  History  of  Nature.  47 %0a%3c %0a%3c Africa.  For  Writers  have  given  out  that,  rising  out  of  the %0a%3c very  midst  of  the  Sands,  it  rnounteth  to  the  Sky,  rough  and %0a%3c ill-favoured  on  that  side  which  lieth  toward  the  Shore  of  the %0a%3c Ocean,  unto  which  it  gave  the  Denomination  :  and  the  same %0a%3c is  shadowy,  full  of  Woods,  and  watered  with  Sources  of %0a%3c spouting  Springs,  on  the  way  which  looketh  to  Africa,  with %0a%3c Fruits  of  all  sorts,  springing  of  their  own  accord,  one  under %0a%3c another,  in  such  a  manner,  that  at  no  time  is  Fulness  of  Plea- %0a%3c sure wanting.  Moreover,  that  none  of  the  Inhabitants  are %0a%3c seen  by  day  :  all  is  silent,  like  the  Awe  of  Solitude  :  a  secret %0a%3c Devotion  creepeth  into  the  Hearts  of  those  who  approach %0a%3c near  to  it;  and  besides  this  Awe  they  are  lifted  above  the %0a%3c Clouds,  even  close  to  the  Circle  of  the  Moon  :  that  the  same %0a%3c (Mountain)  shineth  by  Night  with  frequent  Fires,  and  is %0a%3c filled  with  the  Lasciviousness  of  jÂ£gi  panes  and  Satyrs  ;  that  it %0a%3c resoundeth  with  the  Melody  of  Flutes  and  Pipes ;  and %0a%3c ringeth  with  the  Sound  of  Drums  and  Cymbals.  These  are %0a%3c the  Reports  of  famous  Writers,  besides  the  Labours  of %0a%3c Hercules  and  Perseus  there.  The  Way  unto  it  is  exceedingly %0a%3c long,  and  not  certainly  known.  There  were  also  Com- %0a%3c mentaries of  Hanno,  the  General  of  the  Carthaginians,  who %0a%3c in  the  time  of  the  most  flourishing  state  of  Carthage  had  a %0a%3c charge  to  explore  the  Circuit  of  Africa.  Him,  most  of  the %0a%3c Greeks  as  well  as  our  Countrymen  following,  among  some %0a%3c other  fabulous  Stories,  have  written  that  he  also  built  many %0a%3c Cities  there  :  but  neither  any  Memorial,  nor  Token  of  them %0a%3c remain.  When  Scipio  jSZmylianus  carried  on  War  in  Africa, %0a%3c Polybius,  the  Writer  of  the  Annals,  received  from  him  a  Fleet ; %0a%3c and  having  sailed  about  for  the  purpose  of  searching  into  that %0a%3c part  of  the  World,  he  reported,  That  from  the  said  Mountain %0a%3c West,  toward  the  Forests  full  of  Wild  Beasts,  which  Africa %0a%3c breedeth,  to  the  River  Anatis,  are  485  Miles ;  and  from %0a%3c thence  to  Lixus,  205.  Agrippa  saith,  That  Lixus  is  distant %0a%3c from  the  Straits  of  Gades  112  Miles.  Then,  that  there  is  a %0a%3c Bay  called  Saguti;  also  a  Town  upon  the  Promontory, %0a%3c Mutelacha.  Rivers,  Subur  and  Sala.

Then  a  Bay  of  516  Miles,  enclosed  within  the  Promon- %0a%3c tory of  the  Mountain  Barce,  running  out  into  the  West,  which %0a%3c is  called  Surrentium .  After  it,  the  River  Palsus,  beyond  which %0a%3c are  the  ^Ethiopian  Perorsi,  and  at  their  back  are  the  Pharusi. %0a%3c Upon  whom  join  the  inland  People,  the  Geetuli  Darae.  But %0a%3c upon  the  Coast  are  the  ^Ethiopian  Daratitee ;  the  River %0a%3c Bambotus  full  of  Crocodiles  and  Hippopotami.  From  which, %0a%3c he  saith,  there  is  a  Continuation  of  Mountains  as  far  as  to %0a%3c that  which  we  call  Theon-Ochema  (the  Gods'  Chariot). %0a%3c Then,  in  sailing  nine  Days  and  Nights  to  the  Promontory %0a%3c Hesperium,  he  hath  placed  the  Mountain  Atlas  in  the  mid- %0a%3c way ;  which  by  all  other  Writers  is  set  down  to  be  in  the %0a%3c utmost  Borders  of  Mauritania.  The  Romans  first  warred  in %0a%3c Mauritania,  in  the  time  of  Claudius  the  Prince :  when %0a%3c JEdcemon,  the  Freedman  of  King  Ptolemceus,  who  was %0a%3c slain  by  C.  Ccesar,  endeavoured  to  avenge  his  Death.  For %0a%3c as  the  Barbarians  fled  backward,  the  Romans  came  to  the %0a%3c Mountain  Atlas.  And  not  only  to  such  Generals  as  had %0a%3c been  Consuls,  and  to  such  as  were  of  the  Senate,  who  at  that %0a%3c time  managed  affairs,  but  to  Knights  also,  who  from  that %0a%3c time  had  command  there,  was  it  a  glory  to  have  pene- %0a%3c trated to  the  Atlas.  *Five  Roman  Colonies,  as  we  have %0a%3c said,  are  in  that  Province,  and  by  common  fame  it  may  seem %0a%3c to  be  accessible.  But  this  is  found  for  the  most  part  by %0a%3c Experience  very  fallacious  :  because  Persons  of  high  Rank, %0a%3c when  it  is  irksome  to  search  out  the  Truth,  find  it  not  irk- %0a%3c some through  the  shame  of  Ignorance,  to  give  out  Untruths  : %0a%3c and  never  are  Men  more  credulous  to  be  deceived  than  when %0a%3c some  grave  Author  fathereth  the  lie.  And  indeed  I  less %0a%3c wonder,  that  things  are  not  known,  when  they  of  the  Eques- %0a%3c trian Order,  and  those  now  also  of  the  Senatorial  Rank, %0a%3c admire  nothing  but  Luxury:  which  very  powerful  and  pre- %0a%3c vailing Force  is  seen  when  Forests  are  searched  for  Ivory  and %0a%3c Citron-trees :  and  all  the  Rocks  in  Getulia  for  Murices  and %0a%3c %0a%3c *  It  seemeth  that  this  clause  is  to  be  set  in  the  beginning  of  the  next %0a%3c chapter. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BOOK  V.]  History  of  Nature.  49 %0a%3c %0a%3c Purpurae.  Nevertheless  the  natural  Inhabitants  report,  That %0a%3c in  the  Sea-coast  150  Miles  from  Sala  there  is  the  River %0a%3c Asana,  that  receiveth  Salt  Water  into  it,  but  with  a  goodly %0a%3c Harbour :  and  not  far  from  it  a  River,  which  they  call  Fut : %0a%3c from  which  to  Dyris  (for  that  is  the  Name  in  their  Language %0a%3c of  Atlas)  are  200  Miles,  with  a  River  coming  between, %0a%3c named  Vior.  And  there,  by  report,  are  to  be  seen  the  cer- %0a%3c tain tokens  of  a  Soil  formerly  inhabited ;  the  vestiges  of %0a%3c Vineyards  and  Date-tree  Groves.  Suetonius  Paulinus  (a %0a%3c Consul  in  our  time),  who  was  the  first  Roman  Leader  that %0a%3c passed  over  Atlas  for  the  space  of  some  Miles,  also  hath  re- %0a%3c ported regarding  the  height  thereof:  and  moreover,  that  the %0a%3c foot  of  it  toward  the  bottom  is  full  of  thick  and  tall  Woods, %0a%3c with  Trees  of  an  unknown  kind,  but  the  height  of  them  is %0a%3c delightful  to  see,  smooth  and  beautiful,  the  branches  like %0a%3c Cypress  ;  and,  besides  the  strong  smell,  are  covered  over %0a%3c with  a  thin  Down,  of  which  (with  some  help  of  Art)  fine %0a%3c Cloth  may  be  made,  such  as  the  Silk-worm  yieldeth :  that %0a%3c the  top  of  it  is  covered  with  deep  Snow,  even  in  Summer, %0a%3c and  that  he  reached  up  to  it  on  the  tenth  day,  and  beyond  to %0a%3c the  River  called  Niger,  through  solitudes  of  black  Dust, %0a%3c with  sometimes  conspicuous  ragged  Rocks,  appearing  as  if %0a%3c burnt :  places  by  reason  of  the  Heat  not  habitable,  although %0a%3c tried  in  the  Winter  Season.  Those  who  dwelt  in  the  next %0a%3c Forests  were  pestered  with  Elephants,  wild  Beasts,  and %0a%3c Serpents  of  all  sorts  ;  and  those  People  were  called  Canarii ; %0a%3c because  they  and  Animals  feed  together,  and  part  among %0a%3c them  the  Bowels  of  wild  Beasts.  For  it  is  sufficiently %0a%3c known  that  a  Nation  of  ^Ethiopians,  whom  they  call  Peroresi, %0a%3c joineth  to  them.  Juba,  the  Father  of  Ptolemceus,  who  for- %0a%3c merly ruled  over  both  Mauritania,  a  Man  more  memorable %0a%3c for  his  illustrious  Studies  than  for  his  Kingdom,  hath  written %0a%3c the  like  concerning  Atlas ;  and  (he  saith)  moreover,  that %0a%3c there  is  an  Herb  growing  there  called  Euphorbia,  from  his %0a%3c Physician's  name  that  first  found  it:  the  Milky  Juice  of %0a%3c which  he  praiseth  exceedingly  much  for  clearing  the  Eyes %0a%3c and  against  Serpents  and  all  Poisons,  in  a  dedicated  Book  by %0a%3c itself.  Thus  much  may  suffice,  if  not  too  much,  about  Atlas. %0a%3c %0a%3c VOL.  II.  E %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 50  History  of  Nature.  [BooK  V. %0a%3c %0a%3c y  CHAPTER  II. %0a%3c %0a%3c The  Province  Tingitania. %0a%3c %0a%3c THE  Length  of  the  Province  Tingitania  is  170  Miles.  The %0a%3c Nations  therein  are  these :  The  Mauri,  which  in  times  past %0a%3c was  the  principal,  and  of  whom  the  Province  took  its  Name : %0a%3c and  those  most  Writers  have  called  Marusii.  Being  by  War %0a%3c weakened,  they  wasted  to  a  few  Families.  Next  to  them %0a%3c were  the  Masssesuli,  hut  in  like  manner  they  were  extin- %0a%3c guished. Now  are  the  Nations  inhabited  by  the  Getulae, %0a%3c Bannurri,  and  the  Autololes,  the  most  powerful  of  all :  a %0a%3c part  of  whom  were  once  the  Vesuni :  but  being  divided  from %0a%3c them,  they  became  a  Nation  by  themselves,  and  were  turned %0a%3c to  the  ./Ethiopians.  This  Province  being  full  of  Mountains %0a%3c eastward,  affordeth  Elephants.  In  the  Mountain  Abila, %0a%3c also,  and  in  those  which  for  their  equal  height  they  call %0a%3c the  Seven  Brethren :  these  are  joined  to  Abila,  which  looketh %0a%3c over  the  arm  of  the  Sea.  From  these  beginneth  the  Coast  of %0a%3c the  Inward  Sea.  The  River  Tamuda  navigable,  and  for- %0a%3c merly a  Town.  The  River  Laud,  which  also  is  able  to %0a%3c receive  Vessels.  The  Town  Rusardir,  and  the  Harbour. %0a%3c The  navigable  River  Malvana.  The  Town  Siga,  over %0a%3c against  Malacha,  situated  in  Hispania  :  the  royal  Seat  of %0a%3c Syphax,  and  now  the  other  Mauritania.  For  a  long  time  they %0a%3c kept  the  names  of  the  Kings,  so  that  the  furthest  was  called %0a%3c Bogadiana:  and  likewise  Bocchi,  which  now  is  Caesariensis. %0a%3c Next  to  it  is  the  Harbour  for  its  space  called  Magnus,  with  a %0a%3c Town  of  Roman  Citizens.  The  River  Muluca,  which  is  the %0a%3c limit  of  Bocchi  and  the  Massaesuli.  Quiza  Xeriitana,  a  Town %0a%3c of  Strangers  :  Arsennaria,  a  Town  of  Latins,  3  Miles  from  the %0a%3c Sea :  Carcenna,  a  Colony  of  Augustus,  the  Second  Legion  : %0a%3c Likewise  another  Colony  of  his,  planted  with  the  Pretorian %0a%3c Cohort :  Gunugi :  and  the  Promontory  of  Apollo.  And  a %0a%3c most  famous  Town  there,  Caesarea,  usually  in  old  time  called %0a%3c lol,  the  royal  Seat  of  King  Juba :  endowed  by  Divus  Clau- %0a%3c dius with  the  Right  of  a  Colony,  by  whose  Appointment  the %0a%3c old  Soldiers  were  there  bestowed.  A  new  Town,  Tipasa, %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BOOK  V.]  History  of  Nature.  51 %0a%3c %0a%3c with  the  Liberties  of  Latium.

The  Colony %0a%3c of  Augustus,  Rusconiae:  and  Ruscurum,  by  Claudius  honoured %0a%3c as  a  City  :  Rusoezus,  a  Colony  of  Augustus.  Salde,  a  Colony %0a%3c of  the  same.

Within  Land,  the  Colony %0a%3c Augusta,  the  same  as  Succubar ;  and  likewise  Tubrisuptus. %0a%3c Cities,  Timici,  Tigavse.  Rivers,  Sardabala  and  Nabar.  The %0a%3c Nation,  Macurebi :  the  River  Usar  and  the  Nation  of  the %0a%3c Nabades.  The  River  Ampsaga  is  from  Caesarea  233 %0a%3c Miles.  The  Length  of  either  Mauritania  is  839  Miles,  the %0a%3c Breadth,  467. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  III. %0a%3c Numidia. %0a%3c %0a%3c NEXT  to  Ampsaga  is  Numidia,  renowned  for  the  Name  of %0a%3c Masanissa:  called  by  the  Greeks,  the  Land  Metagonitis. %0a%3c The  Numidian  Nomades  (so  named  from  changing  their  Pas- %0a%3c ture), who  carry  their  Huts,  that  is,  their  Houses,  about  with %0a%3c them  upon  Waggons.  Their  Towns  are  Cullu  and  Rusicade  ; %0a%3c from  which  48  Miles  off,  within  the  midland  Parts  is  the %0a%3c Colony  Cirta,  surnamed  of  the  Sittiani ;  another  also  within %0a%3c Cicca,  and  a  free  Town  named  Bulla  Regia.  But  in  the  Coast, %0a%3c Tacatua,  Hippo  Regius,  and  the  River  Armua.  The  Town %0a%3c Trabacha,  of  Roman  Citizens  :  the  River  Tusca,  which %0a%3c boundeth  Numidia :  and  besides  the  Numidian  Marble,  and %0a%3c abundance  of  wild  Beasts,  nothing  is  there  worth  the %0a%3c noting. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  IV. %0a%3c Africa. %0a%3c %0a%3c FROM  Tusca  forward  is  the  Region  Zeugitana,  and  the %0a%3c Country  properly  called  Africa.  Three  Promontories  :  the %0a%3c White ;  then  that  of  Apollo,  over  against  Sardinia:  that  of  Mer- %0a%3c cury opposite  to  Sicily  ;  which,  running  into  the  Sea,  make %0a%3c two  Bays :  the  one  Hipponensis,  next  to  the  Town  which %0a%3c they  call  Hipponis,  named  by  the  Greeks  Diarrhyton,  on %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 52  History  of  Nature.

And  in  the  other  Bay,  Utica,  of %0a%3c Roman  Citizens,  ennobled  by  the  death  of  Cato :  the  River %0a%3c Bagrada.  A  Place  called  Castra  Cornelia  :  and  the  Colony %0a%3c Carthago,  among  the  Relics  of  great  Carthage:  and  the %0a%3c Colony  Maxulla.  Towns,  Carpi,  Misna,  and  the  free  Clupea, %0a%3c upon  the  Promontory  of  Mercury.  Also,  free  Towns,  Cu- %0a%3c rubis  and  Neapolis.  Soon  is  another  distinction  of  Africa %0a%3c itself.  Libyphoenices  are  they  called,  who  inhabit  Byzacium  ; %0a%3c for  so  is  that  Region  named :  containing  in  Circuit  250  Miles, %0a%3c exceedingly  fertile,  where  the  Ground  sown  yieldeth  to  the %0a%3c Husbandman  an  hundred-fold  Increase.  In  it  are  free  Towns, %0a%3c Leptis,  Adrumetum,  Ruspina,  and  Thapsus :  then,  Thense, %0a%3c Macomades,  Tacape,  Sabrata,  reaching  to  the  Lesser  Syrtis  : %0a%3c unto  which,  the  Length  of  Numidia  and  Africa  from  Am- %0a%3c phaga  is  580  Miles  :  the  Breadth,  of  so  much  as  is  known, %0a%3c 200.  This  Part,  which  we  have  called  Africa,  is  divided  into %0a%3c two  Provinces,  the  old  and  the  new  ;  separated  by  a  Fosse %0a%3c brought  as  far  as  to  Thense,  within  the  African  Gulf;  which %0a%3c Town  is  217  Miles  from  Carthage.  The  third  Bay  is  sepa- %0a%3c rated into  two ;  horrible  Places  for  the  Shallows  and  ebbing %0a%3c and  flowing  of  the  Sea  at  the  two  Syrtes.  From  Carthage %0a%3c to  the  nearer  of  them,  which  is  the  lesser,  is  300  Miles,  by %0a%3c the  Account  of  Polybius :  who  saith,  also,  that  the  said  Pas- %0a%3c sage of  Syrtis  is  100  Miles  forward  and  300  in  Circuit.  By %0a%3c Land  also,  the  Way  to  it  is  by  observation  of  the  Stars,  and %0a%3c through  the  Desert  over  Sands  and  through  Places  full  of %0a%3c Serpents  ;  you  pass  Forests  filled  with  Numbers  of  wild %0a%3c Beasts  :  and  within,  Solitudes  of  Elephants  :  and  soon  after, %0a%3c vast  Deserts,  even  beyond  the  Garamantes,  who,  from  the %0a%3c Augilae,  are  distant  twelve  Days'  Journey.  Above  them  was %0a%3c the  Nation  of  the  Psylli :  and  above  them  the  Lake  of  Lyco- %0a%3c medes  environed  with  Deserts.  The  Augilee  themselves  are %0a%3c seated  about  the  middle  Way  from  Ethiopia  ;  which  bendeth %0a%3c Westward,  and  from  the  Country  lying  between  the  two %0a%3c Syrtes,  with  an  equal  Distance  on  each  Side  :  but  the  Shore %0a%3c between  the  two  Syrtes  is  250  Miles.  There  standeth  the %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BOOK  V.]  History  of  Nature.  53 %0a%3c %0a%3c City  Oeensis,  the  River  Cinyps,  and  the  Country.  Towns, %0a%3c Neapolis,  Taphra,  Abrotonum,  the  other  Leptis,  called  also %0a%3c the  Great.  Then  the  Greater  Syrtis,  in  Compass  625  Miles, %0a%3c and  in  direct  Passage  313.

Next  to  them,  not %0a%3c far  from  the  Continent,  the  vast  Marsh  admitteth  into  it  the %0a%3c River  Triton,  and  taketh  its  Name  from  it :  but  CaUimachus %0a%3c calleth  it  Pallantias,  and  saith  it  is  on  this  Side  the  lesser %0a%3c Syrtes  ;  but  many  place  it  between  both  Syrtes.  The  Pro- %0a%3c montory that  encloseth  the  greater  is  named  Borion.  Beyond %0a%3c is  the  Province  Cyrenaica.  From  the  River  Ampsaga  to  this %0a%3c Bound,  Africa  containeth  26  separate  People,  who  are  subject %0a%3c to  the  Roman  Empire :  among  which  are  six  Colonies,  be- %0a%3c sides the  above-named,  Uthina  and  Tuburbis.

Berenice  standeth  upon  the  outermost  Horn %0a%3c of  Syrtis,  called  formerly  the  City  of  the  above-named  Hes- %0a%3c perides,  according  to  the  wandering  Tales  of  Greece.  And %0a%3c before  the  Town,  not  far  off,  is  the  River  Lethon,  the  sacred %0a%3c Grove  where  the  Gardens  of  the  Hesperides  are  reported  to %0a%3c be.  From  Leptis  it  is  385  Miles.  From  it  is  Arsinoe,  usually %0a%3c named  Teuchira,  43  Miles :  and  from  thence  22  Miles, %0a%3c Ptolemais,  called  in  old  time  Barce.  And  then  250  Miles %0a%3c off,  the  Promontory  Phycus  runneth  out  through  the  Cretic %0a%3c Sea,  distant  from  Tsenarus,  a  Promontory  of  Laconia,  350 %0a%3c Miles  :  but  from  Greta  itself  125  Miles.

The  Inhabitants  there  bordering  are  the  Marmaridse, %0a%3c stretching  out  in  Length  almost  from  Parse  to  mum  to  the %0a%3c Greater  Syrtis.  After  them  the  Ararauceles  :  and  so  in  the %0a%3c very  Coast  of  Syrtis,  the  Nesamones,  whom  formerly  the %0a%3c Greeks  called  Mesammones,  by  reason  of  the  Place,  as %0a%3c seated  in  the  midst  between  the  Sands.  The  Cyrenaic %0a%3c Country,  for  the  Space  of  15  Miles  from  the  Sea-shore,  is %0a%3c fruitful  for  Trees :  and  for  the  same  Compass  within  the %0a%3c Land,  for  Corn  only:  but  then  for  30  Miles  in  Breadth,  and %0a%3c 250  in  Length,  for  Laser.1  After  the  Nasamones  live  the %0a%3c Hasbitae  and  Masse.

It  would  appear,  however,  that  the  Cyrenaic %0a%3c juice  becoming  scarce,  the  ancients  employed  some  other  substance  of %0a%3c similar,  though  inferior  properties,  as  a  substitute,  and  to  both  of  them %0a%3c they  applied  the  term  Laser.  Pliny  (lib.  xix.  c.  3)  says,  "  For  a  long %0a%3c time  past  the  only  Laser  brought  to  us  is  that  which  is  produced  abun- %0a%3c dantly in  Persia,  &c.,  but  it  is  inferior  to  the  Cyrenaic."  Now  it  is  not  at %0a%3c all  improbable  that  the  Laser  of  Persia  may  have  been  our  Asafcedita %0a%3c (Ferula  Asafa>dita,  LIN.)  â  Wern.

They %0a%3c build  themselves  Houses  of  Salt,  hewn  out  of  their  own %0a%3c Mountains  in  the  manner  of  Stone.  From  these  to  the  Tro- %0a%3c glodites,  in  the  South-west  Coast,  the  Country  is  four  Days' %0a%3c Journey ;  with  whom  is  a  Traffic  only  for  a  precious  Stone, %0a%3c which  we  call  a  Carbuncle,  brought  out  of  Ethiopia.  There %0a%3c cometh  between,  the  Country  Phazania  toward  the  Solitudes %0a%3c of  Africa,  above  the  said  Lesser  Syrtis :  where  we  subdued %0a%3c the  Nation  of  the  Phazanii,  with  the  Cities  Alele  and  Cillaba. %0a%3c Also  Cydamum,  over  against  the  region  of  Sabrata.  Next  to %0a%3c these  is  a  Mountain,  reaching  a  great  way  from  East  to %0a%3c West,  called  by  our  People  Ater,  as  if  burnt  by  Nature,  or %0a%3c scorched  by  the  reflection  of  the  Sun.  Beyond  that  Moun- %0a%3c tain are  the  Deserts :  also  Matelgse,  a  Town  of  the  Gara- %0a%3c mantes,  and  likewise  Debris,  which  casteth  forth  a  Fountain, %0a%3c the  Waters  boiling  from  Noon  to  Midnight,  and  for  as  many %0a%3c Hours  to  Mid-day  reducing  again :  also  the  very  illustrious %0a%3c Town  Garama,  the  head  of  the  Garamantes.  All  which %0a%3c Places  the  Roman  Arms  have  conquered,  and  over  them %0a%3c Cornelius  Balbus  triumphed ;  the  only  Man  of  Foreigners %0a%3c that  was  honoured  with  the  (Triumphant)  Chariot,  and  en- %0a%3c dowed with  the  Freedom  of  Roman  Citizens ;  because  being %0a%3c born  at  Gades,  he  and  his  Uncle,  Balbus  the  Elder,  were %0a%3c made  free  Denizens  of  Rome.  And  this  wonder  our  Writers %0a%3c have  recorded,  that  besides  the  Towns  above  named  by  him %0a%3c conquered,  himself  in  his  Triumph  carried  the  Names  and %0a%3c Images,  not  of  Cydamus  and  Garama  only,  but  also  of  all %0a%3c the  other  Nations  and  Cities ;  which  went  in  this  Order. %0a%3c The  Town  Tabidium,  the  Nation  Niteris  ;  the  Town  Neglige- %0a%3c mela,  the  Nation  Bubeium  ;  the  Town  Vel,  the  Nation  Enipi ; %0a%3c the  Town  Thuben,  the  Mountain  named  Niger;  the  Towns %0a%3c Nitibrum  and  Rapsa  ;  the  Nation  Discera,  the  Town  Debris ; %0a%3c the  River  Nathabur,  the  Town  Tapsagum,  the  Nation  Nan- %0a%3c nagi,  the  Town  Boin ;  the  Town  Pege,  the  River  Dasibari. %0a%3c Presently  these  Towns  lying  continuously,  Baracum,  Buluba, %0a%3c Alasi,  Balsa,  Galla,  Maxala,  and  Zinnia.

In  that  Tract  there  lieth  in  the  way %0a%3c the  Village  Apis,  a  place  noble  for  the  Religion  of  Egypt. %0a%3c From  it  to  Parsetonium,  12  Miles.

The %0a%3c fairest  is  Meninx,  35  Miles  long  and  25  broad,  called  by %0a%3c Eratosthenes  Lotophagitis.  It  hath  two  Towns,  Meninx  on %0a%3c the  side  of  Africa,  and  Thoar  on  the  other :  itself  is  situated %0a%3c from  the  right-hand  Promontory  of  the  Lesser  Syrtis  200 %0a%3c Paces.1  A  hundred  Miles  from  it  against  the  left  hand  is %0a%3c Cercina,  with  a  free  Town  of  the  same  Name,  in  Length  25 %0a%3c Miles,  and  half  as  much  in  Breadth  where  it  is  most :  but %0a%3c toward  the  end  not  above  five  Miles.  To  it  there  lieth  a %0a%3c little  one  toward  Carthage  called  Cercinitis,  and  it  joineth %0a%3c by  a  Bridge.  From  these,  almost  50  Miles,  lieth  Lopadusa, %0a%3c six  Miles  long.

Above  them  are  the  Ethiopian %0a%3c Nations  :  the  Nigritae,  from  whom  the  River  was  named  :  the %0a%3c Gyrnnetes,  Pharusi,  and  those  which  now  reach  to  the  Ocean, %0a%3c whom  we  spake  of  in  the  border  of  Mauritania  :  the  Perorsi. %0a%3c From  all  these  are  vast  Solitudes  eastward,  to  the  Gara- %0a%3c mantes,  Augylse,  and  Troglodites,  according  to  the  truest %0a%3c opinion  of  them  who  place  two  ^Ethiopias  above  the  Deserts %0a%3c of  Africa :  and  especially  of  Homer,  who  saith,  that  the %0a%3c Ethiopians  are  divided  two  ways,  towards  the  East  and %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  Or  1500  paces,  i.  e.  a  mile  and  a  half. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 58  History  of  Nature.

The  River  Niger  is  of  the  same  nature  as  Nilus ; %0a%3c producing  the  Reed  and  Papyrus,  and  the  same  living  Crea- %0a%3c tures, and  swelleth  at  the  same  Seasons.  It  springeth  be- %0a%3c tween the  Tareleia  jEthiopiae,  and  the  Oecalicae.  The  Town %0a%3c Mavin,  belonging  to  this  People,  some  have  set  upon  the %0a%3c deserts  :  near  them  the  Atlantae ;  the  jEgipanae,  half  beasts  ; %0a%3c the  Blemmyae,  the  Gamphasantae,  Satyri,  and  Himantopodae. %0a%3c Those  Atlantae,  if  we  will  believe  it,  degenerate  from  Human %0a%3c Manners :  for  neither  call  they  one  another  by  any  Name  : %0a%3c and  they  look  upon  the  Sun,  rising  and  setting,  with  dread- %0a%3c ful curses,  as  being  pernicious  to  them  and  their  Fields  : %0a%3c neither  Dream  they  in  their  Sleep,  as  other  Men.  The %0a%3c Troglodites  dig  Caverns,  and  these  serve  them  for  Houses : %0a%3c they  feed  upon  the  Flesh  of  Serpents ;  they  make  a  gnash- %0a%3c ing Noise,  not  a  Voice,  so  little  exchange  have  they  of  Speech. %0a%3c The  Garamantes  live  out  of  Marriage,  and  converse  with %0a%3c their  Women  in  common.  The  Augylae  only  worship  the %0a%3c Infernal  Gods.  The  Gamphasantes  are  naked,  and  know  no %0a%3c Wars,  and  associate  with  no  Foreigner.  The  Blemmyae,  by %0a%3c report,  have  no  Heads,  but  their  Mouth  and  Eyes  fixed  in %0a%3c their  Breast.  The  Satyri,  besides  their  Shape,  have  nothing %0a%3c of  Human  Manners.  The  jEgipauae  are  shaped  as  you  see %0a%3c them  commonly  painted.  The  Himantopodae  are  some  of %0a%3c them  wry-legged,  with  which  they  naturally  go  creeping. %0a%3c The  Pharusi,  formerly  Persae,  are  said  to  have  been  the %0a%3c Companions  of  Hercules,  as  he  went  to  the  Hesperides. %0a%3c More  of  Africa  worth  the  noting  does  not  occur.1 %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  IX. %0a%3c Of  Asia. %0a%3c %0a%3c UNTO  it  joineth  Asia,  which  from  the  Mouth  of  Canopus %0a%3c unto  the  Mouth  of  Pontus,  according  to  Timosthenes,  is  2639 %0a%3c Miles.

For  which  cause,  some  have %0a%3c reckoned  Egypt  among  the  Islands,  considering  that  Nilus %0a%3c doth  so  divide  itself  as  to  make  a  triangular  figure  of  the %0a%3c Land.  And  so,  many  have  called  Egypt  by  the  Name  of  the %0a%3c Greek  letter  Delta  (A).  The  Measure  of  it  from  the  Channel %0a%3c where  it  is  single,  from  whence  it  first  parteth  into  sides,  to %0a%3c the  Mouth  of  Canopus,  is  146  Miles  ;  and  to  the  Pelusiac  256. %0a%3c The  upmost  part  bounding  upon  ^Ethiopia,  is  called  Thebais. %0a%3c It  is  divided  into  Townships,  with  separate  Jurisdictions, %0a%3c which  they  call  Nomi :  as  Ombites,  Phatunites,  Apol- %0a%3c lopolites,  Hermonthites,  Thinites,  Phanturites,  Captites, %0a%3c Tentyrites,  Diospalites,  Antaeopolites,  Aphroditopolites,  and %0a%3c Lycopolites.

The  Nilus, %0a%3c rising  from  unknown  Springs,  passeth  through  Deserts  and %0a%3c burning  Countries:  and  going  a  vast  way  in  Length,  is %0a%3c known  by  Fame  only,  without  Arms,  without  Wars,  which %0a%3c have  discovered  all  other  Lands.  It  hath  its  beginning,  so %0a%3c far  as  King  Juba  was  able  to  search,  in  a  Mountain  of  the %0a%3c lower  Mauritania,  not  far  from  the  Ocean,  near  to  a  stag- %0a%3c nant Lake,  which  they  call  Nilides.  In  it  are  found  the %0a%3c Fishes  called  Alabetae,1  Coracini,  Siluri,  and  also  the  Cro- %0a%3c codile. Upon  this  argument  the  Nilus  is  thought  to  spring %0a%3c from  hence,  for  that  it  is  seen  dedicated  by  him  at  Csesarea, %0a%3c in  Iseum,  at  this  day.  Moreover,  it  is  observed,  that  as  the %0a%3c Snow  or  Rain  fills  the  Country  in  Mauritania,  so  the  Nilus %0a%3c increases.  When  it  is  run  out  of  this  Lake,  it  scorneth %0a%3c to  pass  through  the  sandy  and  unclean  Places,  and  hideth %0a%3c itself  for  some  Days'  Journey.  By  and  by  out  of  another %0a%3c greater  Lake  it  breaketh  forth  in  the  Country  of  the  Mas- %0a%3c ssesyli,  of  Mauritania  Csesariensis  ;  and  as  if  it  looks  about  for %0a%3c the  Company  of  Men,  with  the  same  arguments  of  living %0a%3c Creatures,  again  becomes  received  within  the  Sands,  where %0a%3c it  is  hidden  a  second  time  for  20  Days'  Journey  in  the %0a%3c Deserts,  as  far  as  to  the  next  ^Ethiopse :  and  so  soon  as  it %0a%3c hath  again  espied  a  Man,  forth  it  leapeth  (as  it  should  seem) %0a%3c out  of  that  Spring,  which  they  called  Nigris.  And  then %0a%3c dividing  Africa  from  ^Ethiopia,  being  acquainted,  if  not  pre- %0a%3c sently with  people,  yet  with  the  frequent  company  of  wild  and %0a%3c savage  Beasts,  and  creating  the  shade  of  Woods,  it  cutteth %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  The  first  named,  Alabes  or  Alabetse,  is  a  species  of  Lota  of  Cuvier, %0a%3c or  Burbot :  though  perhaps  not  the  same  with  the  fish  of  that  name  that %0a%3c inhabits  the  fresh  waters  of  Europe.  The  name  Coracinus  has  been %0a%3c applied  to  more  than,  one  fish  of  a  sooty  colour :  but  the  species  referred %0a%3c to  by  Pliny  is  probably  the  Perca  Nilotica  of  Linnaeus :  the  Lates  Nilo- %0a%3c ticus  of  Cuvier.  The  Silurus  of  Pliny  is  perhaps  a  species  of  Cuvier's %0a%3c genus  Schilbe,  although  true  Siluri  are  found  in  the  Nile.

Thus  dasheth  it  upon %0a%3c such  an  innumerable  Multitude  of  Islands,  and  some  of  them %0a%3c so  very  great,  that  although  it  bear  a  swift  Stream,  yet  is  it %0a%3c not  able  to  pass  beyond  them  in  less  space  than  five  Days. %0a%3c About  the  fairest  of  them,  Meroe,  the  Channel  going  on  the %0a%3c Left  is  called  Astabores,  which  is,  the  Branch  of  a  Water %0a%3c coming  forth  from  Darkness :  but  that  on.  the  Right  is %0a%3c Astusapes,  which  adds  the  signification  of  Lying  hid.  And %0a%3c it  never  taketh  the  Name  of  Nilus,  until  its  Waters  meet %0a%3c again  and  accord  together.  And  even  so  was  it  formerly %0a%3c named  Siris  for  many  Miles:  and  by  Homer  altogether %0a%3c jEgyptus :  by  others,  Triton :  here  and  there  hitting  upon %0a%3c Islands,  and  stirred  with  so  many  Provocations :  and  at  the %0a%3c last  enclosed  within  Mountains :  and  in  no  place  is  it  more  a %0a%3c Torrent,  while  the  Water  that  it  beareth  hasteneth  to  a %0a%3c Place  of  the  .ZEthiopii  called  Catadupi,  where  in  the  last %0a%3c Cataract  among  the  opposing  Rocks  it  is  supposed  not  to %0a%3c run,  but  to  rush  down  with  a  mighty  Noise.  But  afterwards %0a%3c it  becometh  gentle,  as  the  Stream  is  broken  and  the  violence %0a%3c subdued  and  partly  wearied  with  his  long  way :  and  so, %0a%3c though  with  many  Mouths,  it  dischargeth  itself  into  the %0a%3c Egyptian  Sea.  Nevertheless,  on  certain  Days  it  swelleth %0a%3c to  a  great  height :  and  when  it  hath  travelled  through  all %0a%3c Egypt,  it  overfloweth  the  Land,  to  its  great  Fertility.  Dif- %0a%3c ferent causes  of  this  Increase  have  been  given  :  but  those %0a%3c which  carry  the  most  probability  are  either  the  rebounding %0a%3c of  the  Water  driven  back  by  the  Etesian  Winds,  at  that  time %0a%3c blowing  against  it,  and  driving  the  Sea  upon  the  Mouths  of %0a%3c the  River :  or  the  Summer  Rain  in  ^Ethiopia,  by  reason %0a%3c that  the  same  Etesian  Winds  bring  Clouds  thither  from %0a%3c other  parts  of  the  World.  Timceus  the  Mathematician %0a%3c alleged  an  hidden  reason  for  it,  which  is,  that  the  Foun- %0a%3c tain of  the  Nilus  is  named  Phiala,  and  the  River  itself  is %0a%3c hidden  within  Trenches  under  the  Ground,  breathing  forth %0a%3c in  a  Vapour  out  of  reeking  Rocks,  where  it  lieth  concealed. %0a%3c But  so  soon  as  the  Sun  during  those  Days  cometh  near,  it  is %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 62  History  of  Nature.

And  this  happeneth  from  the  rising  of  the  Dog %0a%3c through  the  Sun's  entrance  into  Leo,  while  the  Star  standeth %0a%3c perpendicularly  over  the  Fountain  :  when  in  that  Tract  there %0a%3c are  no  Shadows  to  be  seen.  Many  again  were  of  a  different %0a%3c Opinion :  that  a  River  floweth  more  abundantly  when  the %0a%3c Sun  is  departed  toward  the  North  Pole,  which  happeneth  in %0a%3c Cancer  and  Leo,  and  therefore  at  that  time  it  is  not  so  easily %0a%3c dried :  but  when  it  is  returned  again  toward  Capricorn  and %0a%3c the  South  Pole,  it  is  drunk  up,  and  therefore  floweth  more %0a%3c sparily.  But  if,  according  to  Timceus,  it  would  be  thought %0a%3c possible  that  the  Water  should  be  drawn  up,  the  want  of %0a%3c Shadows  during  those  Days,  and  in  those  Places,  continueth %0a%3c still  without  end.  For  the  River  beginneth  to  increase  at %0a%3c the  New  Moon,  that  is  after  the  Solstice,  by  little  and  little %0a%3c gently,  so  long  as  the  Sun  passeth  through  Cancer,  but  most %0a%3c abundantly  when  he  is  in  Leo.  And  when  he  is  entered %0a%3c into  Virgo  it  falleth  in  the  same  measure  as  it  rose  before. %0a%3c And  it  is  altogether  brought  within  its  banks  in  Libra,  as %0a%3c Herodotus  thinketh,  by  the  hundredth  day.  While  it  riseth %0a%3c it  hath  been  thought  unlawful  for  Kings  or  Governors  to  sail %0a%3c upon  it.  Its  increasings  are  measured  by  Marks  in  certain %0a%3c Pits.  The  ordinary  Height  is  sixteen  Cubits.  The  Waters %0a%3c short  of  this  do  not  overflow  all ;  when  more  than  that  they %0a%3c are  a  hinderance,  by  reason  that  they  retire  more  slowly.  By %0a%3c these  the  Seed  Time  is  consumed,  by  the  Earth  being  too %0a%3c Wet ;  by  the  other  there  is  none,  because  the  Ground  is %0a%3c Thirsty.  The  Province  taketh  reckoning  of  both.  For %0a%3c in  12  Cubits  it  findeth  Famine :  at  13  it  feeleth  Hunger  ;  14 %0a%3c Cubits  comfort  their  Hearts;  15  bring  Safety;  and  16 %0a%3c Dainties.  The  greatest  Increase  that  ever  was  known  until %0a%3c these  Days  was  18  Cubits,  in  the  time  of  Prince  Claudius  : %0a%3c and  the  least,  in  the  Pharsalian  War :  as  if  the  River  by %0a%3c that  Prodigy  turned  away  with  horror  from  the  Slaughter  of %0a%3c that  great  Man.1  When  the  Waters  have  stood,  they  are %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  Pompey  the  Great,  slain  by  treachery  in  Egypt. â Wern.

First,  the %0a%3c practical,  who  lived  in  society,  and  applied  themselves  to  husbandry  and %0a%3c other  harmless  occupations ;  and  second,  the  contemplative,  who  were  also %0a%3c called  therapeutce,  or  physicians,  from  their  application  principally  to  the %0a%3c cure  of  the  diseases  of  the  soul ;  these  last  devoted  themselves  wholly  to %0a%3c meditation,  and  avoided  living  in  great  towns,  as  unfavourable  to  a  con- %0a%3c templative life.  Both  classes  were  exceedingly  abstemious,  and  highly %0a%3c exemplary  in  their  moral  deportment.  Although  our  Saviour  censured %0a%3c all  the  other  sects  of  the  Jews  for  their  vices,  yet  He  never  spoke  of  the %0a%3c Essenes ;  neither  are  they  mentioned  by  name  in  any  part  of  the  New %0a%3c Testament.  Pliny's  object  in  the  account  he  has  thought  fit  to  give  of %0a%3c them  appears  to  have  been  to  say  something  that  might  excite  wonder %0a%3c and  ridicule. â  Wern.

The  upper  half  of  this  monster  had  the  form  of  a  woman, %0a%3c while  the  lower  was  that  of  a  fish.  Atargatis  is  fabled  to  have  thrown %0a%3c herself  into  a  lake  near  Ascalon  in  Syria,  through  vexation  at  the  loss  of %0a%3c her  chastity,  after  having  given  birth  to  a  daughter  named  Semiramis. %0a%3c From  this  circumstance  the  Syrians  abstained  from  eating  the  fish  of  that %0a%3c lake,  deified  Atargatis,  and  built  a  temple  to  her  memory  on  the  borders %0a%3c of  the  lake.  Her  daughter,  Semiramis,  was  left  exposed  in  a  desert ;  but %0a%3c her  life  was  preserved  by  doves  for  one  whole  year,  till  a  shepherd  of %0a%3c N"inus  found  her  and  brought  her  up  as  his  own  child.  She  afterwards %0a%3c married  Menones,  the  governor  of  Nineveh,  and  at  length  became  the %0a%3c celebrated  Queen  of  Assyria.  After  her  death  she  was  changed  into  a %0a%3c dove,  and  received  immortal  honours  in  Assyria.

Its %0a%3c Source,  by  the  Report  of  them  who  have  seen  it  most  closely, %0a%3c is  in  Caranitis,  a  Province  of  Armenia  the  Greater.  These %0a%3c are  Domitius  Corbulo,  who  says,  that  it  riseth  in  the  Moun- %0a%3c tain Aba;  and  Licinius  Mutianus,  who  affirmeth,  that  it %0a%3c issueth  from  the  Foot  of  the  Mountain  which  they  call %0a%3c Capotes,  12  Miles  higher  than  Simyra :  and  that  in  the %0a%3c beginning  it  was  called  Pyxirates.  It  runneth  first  to  Der- %0a%3c xene,  and  then  to  Ana  also,  shutting  out  the  Regions  of  Ar- %0a%3c menia from  Cappadocia.  The  Dastusae  from  Simyra  is  75 %0a%3c Miles.  From  thence  it  is  navigable  to  Pastona,  Fifty  Miles : %0a%3c from  it  to  Melitene  in  Cappadocia,  74  Miles.

It  overflows  its  banks  at  certain  seasons,  and  in  consequence %0a%3c its  banks  are  very  fertile. %0a%3c %0a%3c The  Euphrates  is  universally  allowed  to  take  its  rise  in  Armenia %0a%3c Major ;  but  in  what  particular  spot,  or  in  what  direction  it  afterwards %0a%3c shapes  its  course,  is  still  a  matter  of  the  greatest  disagreement.

Nevertheless,  even  there  where  it  con- %0a%3c quereth  Taurus,  it  suffers  a  Bridge.  At  Claudiopolis  in  Cap- %0a%3c padocia,  it  taketh  its  Course  westward.

Gingla  limiteth  Coma- %0a%3c gene,  and  the  City  of  the  Meri  beginneth  it.  The  Towns %0a%3c Epiphania  and  Antiochia  have  the  River  running  close  to %0a%3c them,  and  they  are  called  Euphrates.  Zeugma  likewise, %0a%3c 72  Miles  from  Samosatse,  is  ennobled  by  the  Passage  over %0a%3c Euphrates  :  for  it  is  joined  to  Apamia,  over  against  it,  by  a %0a%3c Bridge,  built  by  Seleucus  the  Founder  of  both.

For  in  the  Beginning  of  its  Course %0a%3c it  is  called  Imaus  :  a  little  forward  Emodus,  Paropamisus, %0a%3c Circius,  Camibades,  Parphariades,  Choatras,  Oreges,  Oro- %0a%3c andes,  Niphates,  Taurus  ;  and  where  it  is  predominant,  Cau- %0a%3c casus ;  where  it  stretcheth  forth  its  Arms,  as  if  now  and  then %0a%3c endeavouring  toward  the  Seas,  it  taketh  the  Name  Sarpedon, %0a%3c Coracesius,  and  Cragus ;  and  then  again  Taurus,  even  where %0a%3c it  gapeth,  and  opening  itself  to  the  People.  And  yet  it %0a%3c claimeth  its  Unity  still,  and  (these  Passages  are  called)  by %0a%3c the  Names  of  Gates ;  as  in  one  Place  Armenise,  in  another %0a%3c Caspise,  and  again  Cilicise.  And  besides  being  broken  into %0a%3c Parcels,  and  escaped  far  from  the  Sea,  it  taketh  here  and %0a%3c there  many  Names  of  Nations  ;  as,  on  the  right  Hand  Hyr- %0a%3c canus  and  Caspius  ;  on  the  left,  Pariedrus,  Moschicus, %0a%3c Amazonicus,  Coraxicus,  and  Scythicus.  And  throughout  all %0a%3c Greece,  Ceraunius. %0a%3c %0a%3c To  return  to  Lycia,  beyond  its  Promontory,  is  the  Town %0a%3c Simena,  the  Mountain  Chimsera,  emitting  Flames  by  Night; %0a%3c the  City  Hephsestium,  where  the  Hills  likewise  oftentimes %0a%3c are  known  to  burn.  Formerly  the  City  Olympus  stood  there  ; %0a%3c but  now  the  Mountain  Towns,  Gage,  Corydalla,  and  Rhodio- %0a%3c polis.  Near  the  Sea,  Lymira  with  a  River,  into  which %0a%3c Arycandus  runneth  :  also  the  Mountain  Massy  rites,  the %0a%3c Cities  Andriarca  and  Myra.

Soon  after %0a%3c Patara,  formerly  named  Sataros ;  and  Sydinia  on  a  Hill ; %0a%3c the  Promontory  Ciagus.  Beyond  which  is  a  Gulf  equal  to %0a%3c the  former.  There  is  Pinara  ;  and  Telmessus,  that  boundeth %0a%3c Lycia.  In  ancient  Time  Lycia  possessed  threescore  Towns, %0a%3c but  now  36;  of  which  the  most  celebrated,  besides  the  above- %0a%3c named,  are  Canae,  Candyba,  where  the  Wood  Oenium  is %0a%3c praised  ;  Podalia,  Choma  upon  the  River  Adesa,  Cyane, %0a%3c Ascandalis,  Amelas,  Noscopium,  Tlos,  and  Telanorus.  It %0a%3c containeth  in  the  midland  Parts  Chabalia,  with  three  Towns %0a%3c thereto  belonging :  Oenonda,  Balbura,  and  Bubon. %0a%3c %0a%3c Beyond  Telmessus  is  the  Asiatic  Sea,  otherwise  called %0a%3c Carpathium,  and  the  Country  which  is  properly  called  Asia. %0a%3c Agrippa  hath  divided  it  into  two  Parts,  of  which  the  one  by %0a%3c his  Description  boundeth  Phrygia  and  Lycaonia,  eastward  : %0a%3c but  on  the  West  Side  it  is  limited  by  the  JEgean  Sea. %0a%3c Southward  it  boundeth  upon  Egypt:  and  in  the  North  upon %0a%3c Paphlagonia.  The  Length  thereof  by  his  Computation  is %0a%3c 470  Miles,  the  Breadth  300.  The  other  he  hath  limited %0a%3c Eastward  from  Armenia  the  Less:  Westward  by  Phrygia, %0a%3c Lycaonia,  and  Pamphylia;  on  the  North  by  the  Province  of %0a%3c Pontus ;  and  on  the  South  by  the  Pamphylian  Sea  :  it  con- %0a%3c taineth 575  Miles  in  Length,  and  325  in  Breadth.  The  next %0a%3c Coast  bordering  upon  it  is  Caria :  and  near  it,  Ionia; %0a%3c beyond  that,  .ZEolis.  For  Caria  encloseth  Doris  in  the  midst, %0a%3c environing  it  round  on  every  Side  to  the  Sea.  In  it  is  the %0a%3c Promontory  Pedalium,  and  the  River  Glaucus,  charged %0a%3c with  (the  River)  Telmessus.

But  first  it  is  convenient  to %0a%3c have  pointed  out  the  midland  Jurisdictions  and  the  Parts %0a%3c which  lie  behind  :  one  is  named  Cibiratica.  The  Town  itself %0a%3c is  in  Phrygia,  and  to  it  are  joined  25  Cities. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  XXIX. %0a%3c Laodicea,  Apamia,  Ionia,  Ephesus. %0a%3c %0a%3c THE  most  celebrated  City  is  Laodicea.1  It  is  seated  on %0a%3c the  River  Lycus,  Asopus  and  Caper  washing  its  Sides.  This %0a%3c City  was  first  called  Diospolis,  and  afterwards  Rhoas.  The %0a%3c other  Nations  belonging  to  that  Jurisdiction  worth  the  Nam- %0a%3c ing are  the  Hydrelitae,  Themisones,  and  Hierapolitse.  Another %0a%3c Jurisdiction  taketh  its  Name  from  Synnada :  and  to  it  repair %0a%3c the  Licaones,  Appiani,  Eucarpeni,  Dorylaei,  Midsei,  Julienses, %0a%3c and  fifteen  other  ignoble  People.  A  third  (Jurisdiction) %0a%3c goeth  to  Apamia,  which  in  old  Time  was  called  Celsense,  and %0a%3c afterwards  Ciboton.  It  is  situated  at  the  Foot  of  the  Moun- %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  Laodicea,  so  named  in  honour  of  Laodice,  wife  of  Antiochus  II.,  by %0a%3c whom  the  city  was  enlarged.  From  all  accounts  it  appears  to  have  been %0a%3c built  on  a  volcanic  hill,  and  boasted,  in  its  prosperity,  many  public  build- %0a%3c ings of  note,  of  which  the  remains  of  an  aqueduct  and  amphitheatre  are %0a%3c still  to  be  seen. %0a%3c %0a%3c Ephesus  was  the  capital  of  Proconsular  Asia,  and  was  situated  in  Ionia %0a%3c (now  Natolia),  about  five  miles  from  the  .ZEgean  Sea,  on  the  sides  and %0a%3c at  the  foot  of  a  range  of  mountains  overlooking  a  fine  plain  watered  and %0a%3c fertilised  by  the  river  Cayster.  The  city  was  celebrated  for  the  Temple %0a%3c of  Diana,  a  most  magnificent  edifice,  erected  at  the  common  expense %0a%3c of  the  inhabitants  of  Asia  Proper,  and  described  by  Pliny,  b.  xxxvi.  c.  14, %0a%3c but  of  which  the  site  is  now  unknown.  Ephesus  was  finally  overthrown %0a%3c in  tbe  fourteenth  century,  after  continued  struggles.  There  are  numerous %0a%3c traces  of  its  magnificence  still  extant,  though  the  neighbouring  country %0a%3c bears  all  the  marks  of  desolation  and  decay. â  Wern.

The  River  Marsyas, %0a%3c which  a  little  from  his  Spring  is  hidden  under  Ground, %0a%3c where  Marsyas  contended  with  Apollo  in  playing  on  the %0a%3c flute,  sheweth  itself  again  in  Aulocrense,  for  so  is  the  Valley %0a%3c called,  ten  Miles  from  Apamia,  as  Men  travel  to  Phrygia. %0a%3c Under  this  Jurisdiction  we  should  do  well  to  Name  the %0a%3c Metropolitan  Dionysopolitae,  Euphorbeni,  Acmoneses,  Pel- %0a%3c teni,  and  Silbiani.  There  are  besides  60  ignoble  Towns. %0a%3c Within  the  Bay  of  Doris,  Leucopolis,  Amaxitos,  Elaeus,  and %0a%3c Euthene.  Then  Towns  of  Caria,  Pitaium,  Eutaniae,  and %0a%3c Halicarnassus.  To  this  (City)  were  annexed  by  Alexander %0a%3c the  Great,  six  Towns:  Theangela,  Sibde,  Medmossa,  Eura- %0a%3c nium,  Pedasium,  and  Telmessum.  It  is  inhabited  be- %0a%3c tween the  two  Gulfs,  Ceramicus  and  Jasius.  From  thence %0a%3c Myndus,  and  where  formerly  stood  Palaemyndus,  Neapolis, %0a%3c Nariandus,  Carianda,  the  Free  City  Termera,  Bergyla,  and %0a%3c the  Town  Jasus,  which  gave  Name  to  the  Gulf  Jasius.  But %0a%3c Caria  is  most  renowned  for  the  Places  of  Name  within  it, %0a%3c for  therein  are  these  Cities :  Mylasa  Free,  and  Antiochia, %0a%3c where  sometime  were  the  Towns  Seminethos  and  Cranaos  : %0a%3c and  it  is  now  environed  about  with  the  Maeander  and  Mos- %0a%3c sinus.  In  the  same  Tract  also  stood  Maeandropolis.  There %0a%3c is  Eumenia  close  by  the  River  Cludrus ;  the  River  Glaucus  ; %0a%3c the  Town  Lysias  and  Orthasia.  The  Tract  of  Berecinthus, %0a%3c Nysa,  Trallis,  which  also  is  named  Euanthia,  and  Seleucia, %0a%3c and  Antiochia.  It  is  washed  by  the  River  Eudone,  and %0a%3c Thebanis  passeth  through  it.  Some  report  that  the  Pigmaei1 %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  The  Pygmaei  were  a  fabulous  nation  inhabiting  Thrace  and  other %0a%3c regions,  who  brought  forth  young  at  five  years  of  age,  and  were  old  at %0a%3c eight.  Homer  has  celebrated  their  memorable  defeats  by  cranes. â Iliad, %0a%3c 3d  Book. %0a%3c %0a%3c " When  inclement  winters  vex  the  plain %0a%3c %0a%3c With  piercing  frosts,  or  thick  descending  rain, %0a%3c To  warmer  seas  the  cranes  embodied  fly, %0a%3c With  noise,  and  order,  through  the  mid- way  sky : %0a%3c To  pigmy  nations  wounds  and  death  they  bring, %0a%3c And  all  the  war  descends  upon  the  wing." â Pope. %0a%3c %0a%3c Pliny  has  described  these  tiny  creatures  in  Lib.  vi.  c.  22  and  35,  and %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 84  History  of  Nature.  [BooK  V. %0a%3c %0a%3c formerly  there  dwelt.  Besides,  there  are  Thydonos,  Pyrrha, %0a%3c Eurome,  Heraclea,  Amyzon,  and  the  Free  Alabanda,  from %0a%3c which  that  Jurisdiction  took  its  Name.  The  Free  Stratonicea, %0a%3c Hynidos,  Ceramus,  Trcezene,  and  Phorontis.  There  are %0a%3c Nations  farther  remote  that  resort  to  that  Court:  the %0a%3c Othronienses,  Halydienses  or  Hyppini,  Xystiani,  Hydis- %0a%3c senses,  Apolloniates,  Trapezopolitse,  and  the  Free  Aphro- %0a%3c disienses.  Besides  these,  there  are  Cossinus  and  Harpasa, %0a%3c close  by  the  River  Harpasus,  which  also  ran  under  Trallicon, %0a%3c when  such  a  Town  existed.  Lydia  is  watered  by  the  wind- %0a%3c ings of  the  River  Mseander:  and  it  reacheth  above  Ionia: %0a%3c being  near  upon  Phrygia  in  the  East,  upon  Mysia  in  the %0a%3c North,  and  in  the  South  side  enclosing  Caria;  and  was  for- %0a%3c merly named  Mceonia.  It  is  celebrated  chiefly  for  Sardis, %0a%3c seated  upon  the  side  of  the  Mountain  Trnolus,  formerly %0a%3c called  Timolus,  planted  with  Vineyards ;  and  from  it  flows %0a%3c Pactolus,  called  likewise  Chrysorrhoa :  as  also  the  Fountain %0a%3c Tames.  This  City  was  commonly  by  the  Mceonise  called %0a%3c Hyde,  and  was  famous  for  the  Lake  of  Gyges.  That  Juris- %0a%3c diction is  at  this  Day  called  Sardiana.

Anim.  lib.  viii.,  and %0a%3c Mela,  lib.  iii.  There  can  be  no  question  but  that  the  ancient  fictions  of %0a%3c pygmies,  satyrs,  cynocephali,  cynoprosopi,  &c.,  and  other  supposed  tribes %0a%3c of  human  monsters,  originated  in  vague  accounts  of  different  species  of %0a%3c simiae,  though  the  Bushmen  of  South  Africa  are  supposed  also  to  have %0a%3c been  referred  to  as  a  nation  of  pigmies.  The  earliest  unquestionable %0a%3c reference  to  any  of  the  true  apes  is  found  in  the  Periplus  of  Hanno,  circ. %0a%3c 500  B.C. %0a%3c %0a%3c "  For  three  days,"  says  the  Carthaginian  admiral,  "  we  passed  along  a %0a%3c burning  coast,  and  at  length  reached  a  bay  called  the  Southern  Horn. %0a%3c In  the  bottom  of  this  bay  we  found  an  island  similar  to  that  already  men- %0a%3c tioned ;  this  island  contained  a  lake,  that  in  its  turn  contained  another %0a%3c island,  which  was  inhabited  by  wild  men.  The  greater  number  of  those %0a%3c we  saw  were  females ;  they  were  covered  with  hair,  and  our  interpreters %0a%3c called  them  Gorilloi.  We  were  unable  to  secure  any  of  the  men,  as  they %0a%3c fled  to  the  mountains,  and  defended  themselves  with  stones.  As  to  the %0a%3c women,  we  caught  three  of  them,  but  they  so  bit  and  scratched  us  that %0a%3c we  found  it  impossible  to  bring  them  along;  we  therefore  killed  and %0a%3c flayed  them,  and  carried  their  hides  to  Carthage." â Wern,  Club. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BOOK  V.]  History  of  Nature.  85 %0a%3c %0a%3c Philadelpheni,  and  those  Moeonians  inhabiting  on  the %0a%3c River  Cogamus,  at  the  Foot  of  Tmolus ;  and  the  Tripoli- %0a%3c tani,  who,  together  with  the  Antoniopolitae,  are  washed  by %0a%3c the  River  Maeander ;  also,  the  Apollonos-Hieritae,  Myso- %0a%3c tmolites,  and  others  of  mean  Reputation. %0a%3c %0a%3c Ionia  beginneth  at  the  Bay  of  Jasius,  and  all  its  Coast  is %0a%3c full  of  Indentations.  The  first  Bay  in  it  is  Basilicus  ;  the %0a%3c Promontory  Posideum,  and  the  Town  called  the  Oracle  of %0a%3c the  Branchidae,  but  at  this  Day,  of  Apollo  Didymaeus,  20 %0a%3c Stadia  from  the  Sea-side.  And  beyond  this  180  Stadia, %0a%3c standeth  Milletus,  the  Head  (City)  of  Ionia,  named  in  Time %0a%3c past  Lelegeis ;  Pitylisa,  also  named  Anactoria.  From  which, %0a%3c as  from  a  Mother,  are  descended  more  than  eighty  others, %0a%3c built  along  the  Sea-coast.  Neither  is  this  City  to  be  de- %0a%3c frauded of  the  Citizen  Cadmus,  who  taught  first  to  declaim %0a%3c in  Prose.  The  River  Maeander  issueth  out  of  a  Lake  in  the %0a%3c Mountain  Aulocrene ;  and  passing  by  many  Towns,  and %0a%3c filled  with  Abundance  of  Rivers,  it  fetcheth  such  windings %0a%3c to  and  fro,  that  oftentimes  it  is  thought  to  run  backward %0a%3c again.  The  first  Country  it  passeth  through  is  Apamia  :  and %0a%3c presently  Eumenitica,  and  so  through  the  Plains  Bargyl- %0a%3c letici.  Last  of  all,  it  cometh  gently  into  Caria,  and  watering %0a%3c all  that  Land  with  a  very  fruitful  Mud,  about  ten  Stadia %0a%3c from  Miletus  it  glideth  into  the  Sea.  Near  (to  that  River)  is %0a%3c the  Mountain  Latmus :  the  Town  Heraclea,  surnamed %0a%3c Caryca,  from  a  Hill  of  that  Name;  also  Myus,  which, %0a%3c as  the  Report  goeth,  was  first  founded  by  the  lones  after %0a%3c their  proceeding  from  Athens ;  Naulochum,  and  Pyrene. %0a%3c Upon  the  Sea-coast  the  (Town)  called  Trogilia ;  the  River %0a%3c Gessus.  This  Region  is  sacred  to  all  the  lonians,  and  there- %0a%3c fore it  is  named  Panionia.  Near  it  was  Phygela,  built  for %0a%3c Fugitives,  as  appeareth  by  the  Name :  and  the  Town  Mara- %0a%3c thesium  :  and  above  it  Magnesia,  designated  with  the  sur- %0a%3c name On-Mseander,  sprung  from  the  Thessalian  Magnesia. %0a%3c From  Ephesus  it  is  distant  15  Miles ;  and  from  Tralleis  it  is %0a%3c three  Miles  farther.  Formerly  it  was  called  Thessaloce  and %0a%3c Androlitia :  and  being  situated  upon  the  Shore,  it  took  away %0a%3c with  it  from  the  Sea  other  Islands  called  Dera*ides.

Beyond  Smyrna  are  Plains,  formed  by  the %0a%3c River  Hermus,   and  therefore   adopting   its    Name.     This %0a%3c (River)  hath  its  Beginning  near  Doryleus,  a  City  of  Phrygia, %0a%3c and  collecteth  into  it  many  Rivers ;  among  which  is  PhrygÂ£, %0a%3c which  giveth  Name  to  the  whole  Nation  and  divideth  Phry- %0a%3c gia and  Caria  asunder.     Moreover,  Lyllus  and  Crios,  which %0a%3c are  well  filled  by  the  other  Rivers  of  Phrygia,  Mysia,  and %0a%3c Lydia.

Their  country  was  bounded  on  the  west  by  Troas,  in %0a%3c which  region  was  situated  the  city  of  that  name,  of  which  numerous %0a%3c vestiges  remain,  attesting  its  former  splendour.  "Indeed,"  says  Mr. %0a%3c Fellowes,  who  visited  the  spot  in  1838,  "  for  many  miles  round  the  soil  is %0a%3c rendered  useless  for  agriculture,  by  the  multitude  of  broken  marbles, %0a%3c stones,  and  arches,  which  lie  under  the  surface  in  every  direction." %0a%3c %0a%3c Pergamus  was  the  ancient  capital  of  Mysia,  and,  as  its  ruins  also  attest, %0a%3c was  a  magnificent  city.â  Wern.

In  old  Time  it  was  a %0a%3c Day's  Sailing  from  Egypt :  and  now  by  Fires  from  a  Watch- %0a%3c Tower,  Sailors  are  directed  in  the  Night.  It  is  a  Colony  of %0a%3c Casar  the  Dictator.  Alexandria  is  encompassed  with  de- %0a%3c ceitful Shallows,  and  there  are  but  three  Channels  from  the %0a%3c Sea;  Tegamum,  Posideurn,  and  Taurus.  Next  to  that  Isle, %0a%3c in  the  Phoenician  Sea  before  Joppa,  lieth  Paria,  an  Island %0a%3c not  larger  than  the  Town,  in  which  they  report  that  Andro- %0a%3c meda was  exposed  to  the  Beast.2  Also  Arados  beforenamed, %0a%3c between  which  and  the  Continent,  as  Mutianus  says,  there  is %0a%3c a  Fountain  in  the  Sea,  where  it  is  fifty  Cubits  deep,  out  of %0a%3c which  Fresh  Water  is  drawn  from  the  very  Bottom  of  the %0a%3c Sea,  through  Pipes  made  of  Leather.  The  Pamphylian  Sea %0a%3c hath  some  Islands  of  little  Importance.  In  the  Cilician  Sea %0a%3c is  Cyprus,  one  of  the  Five  greatest,  and  it  lieth  east  and %0a%3c west,  opposite  Cilicia  and  Syria ;  in  Times  past  the  Seat  of %0a%3c Nine  Kingdoms.  Timosthenes  saith,  that  it  contained  in %0a%3c Circuit  four  hundred  and  nineteen  Miles  and  a  half; %0a%3c but  Isidorus  is  of  opinion,  that  it  is  but  three  hundred %0a%3c and  seventy-five  Miles  in  Compass.  Its  Length  between %0a%3c the  two  Promontories,  Dinaretas  and  Acamas,  which %0a%3c is  westward,  Artemidorus  reporteth  to  be  160|  Miles:  and %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  Jacob  Bryant,  in  his  "Analysis  of  Ancient  Mythology,"  (vol.  ii.  p.  4,) %0a%3c says,  "  that  the  priests  of  Egypt  laughed  at  this  account  of  the  pilot  of %0a%3c Menelaus,  as  an  idle  story ;  affirming  that  the  place  was  much  more  an- %0a%3c cient than  the  people  of  Greece ;  and  the  name  not  of  Grecian  original." %0a%3c Also  Stephanus  of  Byzantium  calls  the  pilot  Pharos,  and  not  Canopus. â %0a%3c Wem.

Near  Smyrna  are %0a%3c the  Peristerides,  Carteria,  Alopece,  Elseussa,  Bachina,  Pys- %0a%3c tira,  Crommyonnesus,  and  Megale.  Before  Troas,  the  Asca- %0a%3c niae,  and  three  Plateae.  Then  the  Lainiae,  and  two  Plitaniae ; %0a%3c Plate,  Scopelos,  Getone,  Artheidon,  Celae,  Lagussae,  and %0a%3c Didymae.  But  the  most  illustrious  is  Lesbos,  which  is  from %0a%3c Chios  threescore  and  five  Miles.  It  was  called  Hemerte,  and %0a%3c Lasia,  Pelasgia,  J^gira,  Mihyope,  and  Macaria :  famous  for %0a%3c eight  Towns ;  of  which  Pyrrha  is  swallowed  up  by  the  Sea : %0a%3c and  Arisb&  is  overthrown  by  an  Earthquake.  Methymna %0a%3c was  peopled  from  Antissa,  which  was  united  to  it,  and  in  it %0a%3c were  eight  Cities,  and  it  is  about  seven-and-thirty  Miles  from %0a%3c Asia.1  Also  Agamede  and  Hiera  have  perished.  There %0a%3c remain  Eresos,  Pyrrha,  and  the  free  Mitylenae,  which  hath %0a%3c continued  powerful  for  500  Years.  Isidorus  saith,  that  this %0a%3c Island  is  in  Circuit  173  Miles  :  but  the  old  Geographers,  195. %0a%3c In  it  are  these  Mountains,  Lepethymus,  Ordymnus,  Macistus, %0a%3c Creon,  and  Olympus.  It  is  distant  eight  Miles  and  a  half  from %0a%3c the  Continent,  where  it  lieth  nearest.  Islands  near  it,  Sauda- %0a%3c lion,  and  the  five  Leucae.

Outside  the  Helles- %0a%3c pont, over-against  the  Sigean  Coast,  lieth  the  Isle  Tenedus, %0a%3c called  sometimes  Leucophrys,  Phoenice,  and  Lyrnessos. %0a%3c From  Lesbos  it  is  six-and-fifty  Miles,  and  from  Sigaeum %0a%3c twelve  Miles  and  a  half. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  XXXII. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hellespontus,  Mysia,  Phrygia,   Galatia,  Bithynia, %0a%3c Bosporus. %0a%3c %0a%3c THE  Hellespont  then  assumeth  its  Violence  and  over- %0a%3c cometh  the  Sea,  digging  a  Way  with  its  Eddies,  until  it  hath %0a%3c torn  away  Asia  from  Europe.  That  Promontory  we  have %0a%3c named  Trapeza,  ten  Miles  beyond  which  stancleth  the  Town %0a%3c Abydum,  where  the  Straits  are  seven  Stadia  over.  Be- %0a%3c yond it  is  the  Town  Percote,  and  Lampsacum,  called  for- %0a%3c merly Pityusa :  the  Colony  Parium,  which  Homer  called %0a%3c Adrastia.  The  Town  Priapos,  the  River  JEsepus,  Zelia, %0a%3c Propontus ;  as  the  Place  is  called  where  the  Sea  enlargeth %0a%3c itself.  The  River  Granicum,  the  Harbour  Artace,  where %0a%3c once  stood  a  Town.  Beyond  it  is  an  Island,  which  Alexander %0a%3c joined  to  the  Continent,  in  which  standeth  the  Town  Cyzi- %0a%3c cum,  founded  by  the  Milesians,  called  heretofore  Arconne- %0a%3c sos;  Dolionis,  and  Dindymis,  near  the  Top  of  which  is  the %0a%3c Mountain  Dindymus.  Presently  the  Towns  Placia,  Aviacos, %0a%3c ScylacÂ£ :  and  behind  them,  the  Mountain  Olympus,  called %0a%3c Msesius.  The  City  Olympena.  The  Rivers  Horisius  and %0a%3c Rhyndacus,  formerly  named  Lycus.  This  River  taketh  its %0a%3c Beginning  in  the  Lake  Artynia,  near  to  Miletopolis.  It %0a%3c receiveth  the  Marestos  and  many  others  ;  and  separateth %0a%3c Asia  from  Bithynia.  This  Region  was  called  Cronia  :  after- %0a%3c ward Thessalis,  then  Malianda  and  Strymonis.  These  (Na- %0a%3c tions) Homer  named  Halizones,  because  they  are  environed %0a%3c with  the  Sea.  There  was  a  very  great  City  named  Attusa. %0a%3c At  this  Day  there  are  fifteen  Cities,  among  which  is  Gordiu- %0a%3c come,  now  called  Juliopolis ;  and  on  the  Coasts  Dascylos. %0a%3c Then  the  River  Gebes  :  and  within-land,  the  Town  Helgas, %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BooKV.]  History  of  Nature.  95 %0a%3c %0a%3c the  same  as  Germanicopolis,  known  also  Ity  another  Name %0a%3c Booscoete,  as  also  Apamea,  now  called  Myrtea  of  the  Colo- %0a%3c phonians.  The  River  Etheleum,  the  ancient  limit  of  Troas, %0a%3c and  where  Mysia  beginneth.  Afterwards  the  Gulf  into %0a%3c which  runneth  the  River  Ascanium,  the  Town  Bryllion. %0a%3c The  Rivers  Hylas  and  Cios,  with  a  Town  of  that  Name  : %0a%3c which  was  a  Place  of  Trade,  not  far  off  from  the  Inhabitants %0a%3c of  Phrygia,  and  built  by  the  Milesians  in  a  Place  called  As- %0a%3c cania  of  Phrygia.  And  therefore  we  cannot  do  better  than %0a%3c here  to  speak  of  that  Country.  Phrygia  spreadeth  out  above %0a%3c Troas  and  the  Nations  before  named,  from  the  Promontory %0a%3c Lectus  unto  the  River  Etheleus.  It  bordereth  on  the %0a%3c North  upon  part  of  Galatia,  southward  it  boundeth  on  Ly- %0a%3c caonia,  Pisidia,  and  Mygdonia ;  and  on  the  east  it  reacheth %0a%3c to  Cappadocia.  The  most  celebrated  Towns  besides  those %0a%3c before  spoken  of,  are  Ancyra,  Andria,  Celsense,  Colossae,  Ca- %0a%3c rina,  Cotiaion,  Ceranse,  Iconium,  and  Midaion.  Certain %0a%3c Authors  write,  that  out  of  Europe  have  passed  over  the %0a%3c Mysi,  Bryges,  and  Thyni,  from  whom  are  named  the  Mysi, %0a%3c Phryges,  and  Bithyni. %0a%3c %0a%3c At  the  same  time  I  think  it  good  to  write  also  of  Galatia, %0a%3c which  lying  higher  than  Phrygia,  possesseth  a  greater  part  of %0a%3c its  plain  Country,  and  the  former  Capital  of  it,  called  Gordium. %0a%3c They  who  inhabited  that  Quarter  were  sprung  from  the  Gauls, %0a%3c and  were  called  Tolistobogi,  Voturi,  and  Ambitui :  but  they %0a%3c that  occupied  the  Country  of  Mseonia  and  Paphlagonia  were %0a%3c named  Trocmi.  Cappadocia  is  spread  along  from  the  North %0a%3c and  East ;  and  the  most  plenteous  Tract  thereof  the  Tecto- %0a%3c sages  and  Teutobodiaci  kept  in  their  Possession.  And  thus %0a%3c much  for  these  Nations.  The  People  and  Tetrarchies  are  in %0a%3c all  a  hundred  and  ninety  and  five.  The  Towns:  of  the %0a%3c Tectosages,  Ancyra  :  of  the  Trocmi,  Tavium  :  of  the  Tolisto- %0a%3c bogians,  Pesinus.  Besides  these,  there  are  celebrated  the %0a%3c Attalenses,  Arasenses,  Cotnenses,  Dios-Hieronitse,  Lystreni, %0a%3c Neapolitani,  Oeandenses,  Seleucenses,  Sebasteni,  Timmonia- %0a%3c censes,  and  Tebaseni.  Galatia  extendeth  to  Gabalia  and %0a%3c Milyae  in  Pamphylia;  which  are  situated  about  Baris :  also %0a%3c Cyllanticum  and  Oroandicum,  a  Tract  of  Pisidia  :  likewise %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 96  History  of  Nature.  [BoOK  V. %0a%3c %0a%3c Obigene",  a  part  of  Lycaonia.  Rivers  there  are  in  it,  beside %0a%3c those  beforenamed,  Sangarium  and  Gall  as,  from  which  the %0a%3c Priests  of  the  Mother  of  the  Gods  were  named.  Now  to %0a%3c speak  of  what  remains  on  the  Sea-coast :  inward  from  Cios %0a%3c is  Prusa  within  Bithynia ;  founded  by  Annibal  beneath %0a%3c Olympus.  From  Prusa  to  Nicsea,  five-and-twenty  Miles ; %0a%3c the  Lake  Ascanius  lying  between.  Then  Nicsea,  in  the  out- %0a%3c most part  of  the  Gulf  Ascanium,  which  before  was  called %0a%3c Olbia:  also  to  another  Prusa,  undÂ«r  the  Mountain  Hippius. %0a%3c There  were  Pythopolis,  Parthenopolis,  and  Choryphanta. %0a%3c Now  there  are  upon  the  Sea-side  the  Rivers,  .ZEsius,  Bryazon, %0a%3c Plataneus,  Areus,  Siros,  Gendos,  named  also  Chrysorrhoas. %0a%3c The  Promontory  on  which  stood  the  Town  Megaricum.  Then %0a%3c the  Gulf  which  was  called  Craspedites  ;  because  that  Town %0a%3c stood  as  it  were  in  a  Fold  of  it,  There  was  also  the  Town %0a%3c Astacum,  from  which  the  Bay  took  the  Name  of  Astacenus. %0a%3c There  was  also  the  Town  Libyssa,  where  now  remaineth %0a%3c nothing  but  the  Tomb  of  Annibal.  In  the  inmost  part  of %0a%3c the  Gulf  is  the  very  handsome  Town  of  Bithynia,  called %0a%3c Nicomedia.  The  Promontory  Leucatas  which  encloseth  the %0a%3c Bay  of  Astarenus,  is  from  Nicomedia  forty-two  Miles  and %0a%3c a  half.  Being  past  this  Bay,  the  opposite  Shores  approach- %0a%3c ing together,  the  Straits  reach  as  far  as  to  the  Thracian  Bos- %0a%3c phorus.  Upon  these  Straits  standeth  the  Free  (City)  Chalce- %0a%3c don,  seventy-two  Miles  and  a  half  from  Nicomedia.  Formerly %0a%3c it  was  called  Procerastis :  then,  Compusa  :  afterwards,  the %0a%3c City  of  the  Blind ;  because  they  who  founded  it  were  so %0a%3c ignorant  as  not  to  give  a  preference  to  a  Place  seven  Stadia %0a%3c from  Byzantium,  so  much  more  favourable  in  every  respect. %0a%3c But  within-land,  in  Bithynia,  is  the  Colony  Apamena :  also, %0a%3c the  Agrippenses,  Juliopolitae,  and  they  of  Bithynium.  The %0a%3c Rivers,  Syrium,  Lapsias,  Pharmicas,  Alces,  Crynis,  Lylaeus, %0a%3c Scopius,  Hieras,  which  parteth  Bithynia  from  Galatia.  Be- %0a%3c yond Chalcedon,  stood  Chrysopolis:  then,  Nicopolis,  of %0a%3c which  the  Gulf  still  retaineth  the  Name :  wherein  is  the %0a%3c Port  of  Amycus :  the  Promontory  Naulochum  :  Estia, %0a%3c wherein  is  the  Temple  of  Neptune;  and  the  Bosphorus, %0a%3c half-a-mile  over,  which  now  again  parteth  Asia  from  Europe. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BOOK  V.]  History  of  Nature.  97 %0a%3c %0a%3c From  Chalcedon,  it  is  twelve  Miles  and  a  half.  There  begin %0a%3c thej  narrow  Straits,  where  it  is  eight  Miles  and  a  quarter %0a%3c over:  where  stood  the  Town  Philopolis.  All  the  Coasts %0a%3c are  inhabited  by  the  Thyni,  but  the  Inland  Parts  by %0a%3c the  Bithyni.  This  is  the  end  of  Asia,  and  of  282  Nations, %0a%3c which  are  reckoned  from  the  Gulf  of  Lycia  to  this  place. %0a%3c The  Space  of  the  Hellespont  and  Propontis  to  the  Thracian %0a%3c Bosphorus  containeth  in  Length  188  Miles,  as  we  have %0a%3c before  said.  From  Chalcedon  to  Sigeum,  by  the  computa- %0a%3c tion of  Isidorus,  it  is  372  Miles  and  a  half.  Islands  lying  in %0a%3c Propontis  before  Cyzicum  are  these;  Elaphonnesus,  from %0a%3c whence  cometh  the  Cyzicen  Marble ;  and  the  same  Isle  was %0a%3c called  Neuris,  and  Proconnesus.  Then  follow  Ophiiisa, %0a%3c Acanthus,  Phoebe,  Scopelos,  Porphyrione,  and  Halone,  with %0a%3c a  Town.  Delphacia,  Polydora  :  Artaceeon,  with  the  Town. %0a%3c And  over-against  Nicomedia,  is  Demonnesos :  likewise,  be- %0a%3c yond Heraclea,  over-against  Bithynia,  is  Thynnias,  which %0a%3c the  Barbarians  call  Bithynia.  There  is  also  Antiochia  :  and %0a%3c opposite  to  the  narrow  Straits  of  llhyndacus,  Besbicos, %0a%3c eighteen  Miles  in  Circuit.
