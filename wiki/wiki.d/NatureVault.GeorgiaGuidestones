Rusk was basically responsible for orchestrating the creation of the club of rome [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurelio_Peccei#The_Club_of_Rome|#]]. Peccei or Rusk was probably the one responsible for the club of rome commissioning "the limits to growth" in 1972 [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Limits_to_Growth|#]] and Peccei died in 1984.

Peccei died only 4 years after the guidestones were erected, so probably never got around to designing the moonstones before he died. Bank manager said RC christian died but didn't say when he died.  Implied $50,000 to build it. He also said he was a christian which is why he went by RC christian.

Elbert not bieng too far from cherokee in north georgia.  Rusk actually lived in athens georgia at the time when the stones were erected which was much closer to the stones.%0a%0aStrangely the county seat of cherokee county texas is Rusk [[https://mapsforyoufree.blogspot.com/2016/06/map-of-cherokee-county-ga.html?m=1|#]], could this have been where he worked for the CIA during his time at the Rockefeller foundation?  Was the rockefeller gig just a cover job?%0a%0aSupposedly built on a ley line [[https://www.quora.com/What-is-buried-under-the-Georgia-Guidestones|#]] could ithave beenthe closest ley line to Rusk's home?%0a%0aThe mason who physically made them knows things but has sworn to secrecy [[https://www.quora.com/Are-the-Georgia-Guidestones-a-warning|#]]. Anonymous man Robert C Christian pen name had them made by elberton granite finishing company [[https://www.quora.com/Who-wrote-the-Georgia-guidestones|#]] and anon robert said to have been doing itonbehalf of a small group of loyal americans.  %0a%0aElbert couldhave been chosen because it was near enough for Rusk to visit and also on a ley line and also on a granite mine and also far enough away from Rusk for plausible deniability.%0a%0aDivided korea on 38th parallel [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_Rusk|#]] so it would make sense if the guidestones are on a parallel or ley line.%0a%0aOnly spent 7 years in govenrment after army officer in japan. He then left to become president of Rockefeller foundation.  Possibly [[CIA]]?%0a%0aIt would make sense someone like this would consider himself a "loyal american" in the workds of RC christian.%0a%0aLeft secretary in 69 and taught international relations at university of georgia school of law.  This subject hearkens to CIA as well.%0a%0aThe georgia school of law is in athens georgia [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens,_Georgia|#]] VERY close to the georgia guidestones... Just a single county away which would make it convienient for him to visit.  The stones were commisioned 10 years after he started teaching here.  He is buried in the Oconee hill cemetary in athens georgia [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_Rusk#Rusk's_memoir|#]] very close to the georgia guidestones.%0a%0a!!!JFK and RFK assasination%0a%0aWhy did JFK ask rusk to be secretary of state in 1960, 8 years after he left government? [[ https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_Rusk|#]] This would be another clue that he was in CIA during his time at rockefeller.%0a%0aHe vehemently supported vietnam war and was very secretive about his views. and was a favorite of LBJ after JFK assasination [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_Rusk|#]].  Did he play a role in the assasination?%0a%0aHe admitted to a bad relationship with JFK [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_Rusk#Poor_relationship_with_President_Kennedy|#]] distrusted RFK [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_Rusk#Distrusting_Robert_Kennedy|#]] and RFK undercut him [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_Rusk#Robert_Kennedy_undercuts_Rusk|#]] which could be why these two kennedy's were murdered due to Rusk's grudge.%0a%0aThe only two proven kennedy assasinations happened under Rusk's watch as secretary of state [[https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/02/us/kennedy-family-tragedies/index.html|#]]%0a%0aDean rusk and jfk picture [[http://assassinationofjfk.net/jfk-a-reformed-cold-warrior/jfk-dean-rusk/|#]] hosted by someone looking for the truth in the matter.%0a%0aSomeone else thinks Rusk may be responsible [[https://educationforum.ipbhost.com/topic/17075-dean-rusk-was-this-rockefeller-man-involved-in-the-jfk-assassination/|#]]%0a%0aPossible telephone call between LBJ and Rusk november 29 1963 about the assasination 7 days later [[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=yhwM5q1886w|#]]  Rusk complains about who is on the warren commision (investigating the assasination) and "will they be partisan"%0a%0a
