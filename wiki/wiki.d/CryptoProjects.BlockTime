csum=Speed of [[NatureVault/light]] around the world means that the fastest blocktime assuming lightspeed transmission that achieves a fairness parity of 1%25 between a 50%25 network hashrate mining pool and a solo miner is **%25green%256.68379337 seconds%25%25**.  This calculation was done by finding the exact time it takes for light to travel around the circumference of the earth (assuming worst case the sender and receiver are on opposite points on the equator), and then multiplying that by 50, so giving it a factor of 50 which would mean 2%25 orphan rate which would mean 1%25 unfairness between a 50%25 mining pool and a ~0%25 solo miner.  Even though a good design would make 50%25 mining pool, it is the largest it could be while still be considered secure so we might as well design for it.  The only question is, is 1%25 minimum unfairness potential acceptable?  Chances are the unfairness will be much higher due to time it takes to download a block.  Breaking the block into more and more atomic chunks means it can be approached [[https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-September/011176.html|#]].  7s blocktime gives 0.9548276244%25 unfairness.  6s blocktime gives 1.1139655617%25 unfairness.
