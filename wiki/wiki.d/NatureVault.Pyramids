csum=Obelisks were the ground for the positively charged (or possibly negatively) pyramid to build up charge and discharge to. Made from [[granite]] [[https://youtu.be/SrT-1y1kyK8|#]] which has [[piezoelectric]] [[quartz]] (similar to [[gold production]]).  Pointed cap of [[electrum]] [[gold]] [[silver]] alloy. Red Granite, which means it would contain iron in the +3 oxidation state which is ideal for [[gold production]]
