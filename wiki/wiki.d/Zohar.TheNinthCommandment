text=The Ninth Commandment %0a%0a%0a%0a233. The ninth Mitzva is to show mercy to the needy and supply them with %0afood, as it is written: LET US MAKE MAN IN OUR IMAGE, AFTER OUR %0aLIKENESS, and this man will consist of two parts, male and female. IN OUR %0aIMAGE refers to the rich; AFTER OUR LIKENESS refers to the poor. %0a%0a234. For from the male side, they are rich, but from the female side, they are %0apoor. And as they are united together, merciful to each other, and help each %0aother, so below should the rich and the poor be united as one, and should %0ashare with each other, and show mercy to one another. %0a%0a235. We see this in the book of King Shlomo (Solomon): he who shows %0amercy to the poor with all his heart, his image never differs from that of %0aAdam, the first man. And since he was created in the image of Adam, he %0atherefore governs all the creatures on earth by his image, as it is written: %0a"And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the %0aearth" (Beresheet, 9:2), all fear that image, existing in him. For this Mitzva, %0ato show mercy to the poor, is the most important of all the M.itzvot for %0aelevating man to the image of Adam. %0a%0a236. How do we know this? From Nebuchadnezzar. Even though he dreamt %0aa dream, as long as he had mercy upon the poor, that dream did not come %0atrue. However, as soon as he started looking badly upon the poor, his image %0achanged at once, and he distanced from people. Hence, it is written, LET US %0aMAKE MAN. It is said in the form as it was said of charity in another verse. %0aTherefore, MAKE— is the same as charity. %0a%0aThe rich and the poor correspond to the male and the female principles, to %0aZA and his Nukva. However, there is nothing here that hints at the obligation of %0athe rich to be merciful to the poor and provide for his needs. But this instruction %0adiffers from the rest in that in all the others, the Creator's command is separated %0a%0a427 %0a%0a%0a%0a428 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0afrom the action that follows it, as it is written, AND THE CREATOR SAID: %0a'LET THERE BE LIGHT AND THERE WAS LIGHT;' and also, AND THE %0aCREATOR SAID: 'LET THE WATERS BE GATHERED...' AND IT WAS SO; %0aand so on in all the Mitzvot. %0a%0aAnd none of the other Mitzvot contain the Creator's instruction mixed with %0aaction. This is so because the entire creation originated from AVI, where Aba %0aspoke and Ima acted— Aba gave the Light to Ima, and after he gave it to her, he %0astarted acting on it himself. For only with the property of Aba could creation %0anot have manifested in action, as there are no boundaries in creation, in which %0aactions could be revealed. %0a%0aHence, Aba issues a command that designates the passage of Light from %0ahim to Ima. However, since this is merely a command, and not an action (like a %0aforce instead of an action), the future tense is used. The same language is used %0ain the description of man's creation: AND THE CREATOR SAID, "LET US %0aCREATE MAN." Note that the plural form is used: LET US CREATE. %0a%0aBefore the creation of the world of Atzilut (called the world of correction), %0aan action known as Shevirat HaKelim (the breaking of the vessels in the world %0aof Nekudim) took place in the spiritual worlds. It is written: "The Creator %0akept creating and destroying worlds, until He created this world (Atzilut), and %0aHe told it to stop spreading below the boundaries in which it was created" %0a(Beresheet Raba, 3:7). %0a%0aThe breaking of the vessels was essential, for it was the only opportunity to %0amix the egoistic properties (desires) with the altruistic ones; after all, distance %0ain the spiritual is determined by the disparity of properties (desires). And that %0ais why egoism and altruism are infinitely remote from each other. Yet, if this %0ais so, how can egoism possibly be corrected? How can such properties or even %0anotions of the existence of altruistic desires be introduced to man? %0a%0aSo then, to allow egoistic desires to be corrected, the Creator performed the %0abreaking of the vessels— the striking impact between opposite desires, egoistic %0aand altruistic. It is called "striking," for it is impossible to unite these desires by %0aany means other than an "explosion." %0a%0aAs a result of this explosion, the altruistic, pure Kelim (desires) penetrated %0athe egoistic, impure ones, and gave man an opportunity for free will and self- %0acorrection. After the destruction of the pure Kli and the descent of its parts into %0aimpurity, the world of Atzilut was formed. %0a%0aOut of all the mixed desires, the world of Atzilut selected only altruistic %0aones, attached them to itself, corrected them and filled them with Light. Out %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Ninth Commandment %0a%0a%0a%0a429 %0a%0a%0a%0aof these corrected parts, it made the worlds BYA with everything that exists %0awithin them. %0a%0aThese corrections of the broken and mixed Kelim by the world of Atzilut %0aare depicted in the first chapter of the Torah, which speaks of creation. It uses %0athe instructions of exposing and separating the egoistic Kelim from the altruistic %0aones, as, for instance, in the following verses: AND THE CREATOR DIVIDED %0aLIGHT FROM DARKNESS; THE CREATOR DIVIDED WATERS FROM %0aDRY LAND; THE CREATOR DIVIDED DAY FROM NIGHT, and so forth. %0aAll these examples speak of the separation of the pure forces from the impure %0aones, of good from evil. And all that diverged became part of the pure system. %0a%0aTherefore, the entire act of creation is contained in the depiction of the first %0aday of creation, in the words, LET THERE BE LIGHT, as this is when Light was %0aseparated from darkness. This is because, on the whole, purity is called "Light" %0aand impurity is called "darkness." And all the other definitions of purity and %0aimpurity are only particular names designating their various manifestations. %0a%0aThe world of Atzilut made only a partial correction: it only separated %0aaltruistic desires from egoistic desires, Light from darkness, and thus created %0athe system of creation, described in the beginning of the Torah. However, this %0adoes not complete the correction, as darkness and impurity are simply detached %0afrom participating in creation, but remain utterly uncorrected. They are simply %0aseparated as an entirely unnecessary part, and this completely defies the perfection %0aof the Creator, who created everything (including darkness) for His final goal. %0aMoreover, correction ends specifically with the correction of darkness, as it is %0asaid: "Night shines as day; darkness as Light." (Tehilim, 139:12). %0a%0aTo correct this, man was created containing everything, and consisting of %0aall the properties of creation: from the absolute goodness to total evil. This %0aenables man to execute the correction and achieve complete perfection. In other %0awords, he must turn evil to good, bitter to sweet, and darkness to Light. As a %0aresult, death will disappear forever, and the Creator will manifest as the King of %0aall creation. %0a%0aHence, there is a great difference between the description of man's creation %0aand that of all the other creatures and parts of creation. Here, the action itself %0awas mixed with the instructions, for the instructions, descriptions come from %0aIma, not from Aba, who said, LET US CREATE MAN— together with Malchut %0aof the world of Atzilut. %0a%0aThe reason for this is that Malchut includes everything, for she also gives the %0aLight of sustenance to the impure forces to keep them from disappearing from %0a%0a%0a%0a430 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0athe world, as, like all the other elements of creation, the impure forces cannot %0aexist without Light, and immediately disappear. It is written in this regard: HER %0aFEET DESCEND TO DEATH, for the impure forces receive a tiny spark of %0aLight to sustain their existence. %0a%0aThis is why Malchut is called Assiya (action), for she spreads and rules in the %0awhole of creation. She is also called "darkness," for she shines with a spark of %0aLight, to sustain the darkness and evil. %0a%0aHence, when Ima unites with Malchut and their properties mix, she receives %0athe properties of darkness, of which it is said: LET US CREATE MAN IN OUR %0aIMAGE, AFTER OUR LIKENESS, for Light is called "image," and darkness is %0acalled "likeness." Indeed, after Ima mixes with Malchut, these two forces, IMAGE %0aand LIKENESS, appear in her as well. As a result, man, who was created by her, %0acontains these two forces— IMAGE and LIKENESS, too. %0a%0aFrom the phrase, LET US MAKE, it follows that Ima consists of two parts, %0amale and female. Although Ima is a male part (giving is a male property), she is %0aconnected to Malchut. Besides, the male property suggests the presence of Light, %0awhile the property of Nukva (the female part) is poverty and darkness. %0a%0aAnd since Ima accepted Malchut as her partner with the purpose of creating %0aman (accepted the properties of Malchut), she is now filled with poverty and %0adarkness. It follows that man consists of the properties of Ima (wealth and Light), %0aas well as of the properties of Malchut (poverty and darkness). %0a%0aAnd it is this precise combination of the properties of Ima and Malchut that %0aenables man to correct Malchut, fill her with Light, and spread spiritual purity %0aand holiness throughout the entire earth (Malchut). It is written that at the %0aend of correction, "the Creator and His Name shall be one," for the darkness %0ain Malchut will be transformed into Light, as in the male part, HaVaYaH. %0aEverything will be as one in the male property, as it is said, "There will be no %0apoor in your nation." %0a%0aThis Mitzva says that as Ima united with Malchut so as to correct her, which %0ais why Ima includes Image and Likeness, man needs to correct his qualities in %0aorder to correct the parts of darkness within him. To this end, he must diminish %0ahis properties, just like Ima, and give his part (charity) to the poor Malchut, who %0ais deprived of Light. He must show mercy to the LIKENESS (poverty) within %0ahim, and provide it with everything it needs. %0a%0aBy observing this Mitzva, man receives IMAGE and LIKENESS from Ima, %0athe Upper Light that was received by Adam, created in IMAGE and LIKENESS. %0aThis is why he has the power to rule over all the animals in the world (all of his %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Ninth Commandment %0a%0a%0a%0a431 %0a%0a%0a%0aanimal desires) to such an extent that no impure force (desire) remains within %0ahim, which he cannot defeat and correct. %0a%0aThe Zohar gives the example of Navuchadnetzar (Nebuchadnezzar): although %0athe Supreme verdict with regard to him was reached, his dream did not come %0atrue as long as he was merciful to the poor. However, as soon as he allowed his %0aevil eye to look badly upon the poor, the sentence was immediately executed, %0aand his image changed (those who are interested can turn to The Book of Daniel). %0aThus we see that this Mitzva is greater than all the others, and that it can overrule %0athe Supreme verdict made against man. %0a%0a"Charity" signifies the union of Bina and Malchut. Similarly, the story %0aabout the marriage of Rut (Ruth) the Moavite, King David's grandmother %0a(Malchut), and Boaz, who was merciful to her (this marriage started Israel's %0aRoyal Dynasty), describes the correction of Malchut by Bina (See Megilat Rut— %0aThe Book of Ruth).

The ninth Mitzva is to show mercy to the needy and supply them with %0a%3c food, as it is written: LET US MAKE MAN IN OUR IMAGE, AFTER OUR %0a%3c LIKENESS, and this man will consist of two parts, male and female. IN OUR %0a%3c IMAGE refers to the rich; AFTER OUR LIKENESS refers to the poor. %0a%3c %0a%3c 234. For from the male side, they are rich, but from the female side, they are %0a%3c poor. And as they are united together, merciful to each other, and help each %0a%3c other, so below should the rich and the poor be united as one, and should %0a%3c share with each other, and show mercy to one another. %0a%3c %0a%3c 235. We see this in the book of King Shlomo (Solomon): he who shows %0a%3c mercy to the poor with all his heart, his image never differs from that of %0a%3c Adam, the first man.

For this Mitzva, %0a%3c to show mercy to the poor, is the most important of all the M.itzvot for %0a%3c elevating man to the image of Adam. %0a%3c %0a%3c 236. How do we know this?

AND IT WAS SO; %0a%3c and so on in all the Mitzvot. %0a%3c %0a%3c And none of the other Mitzvot contain the Creator's instruction mixed with %0a%3c action. This is so because the entire creation originated from AVI, where Aba %0a%3c spoke and Ima acted— Aba gave the Light to Ima, and after he gave it to her, he %0a%3c started acting on it himself. For only with the property of Aba could creation %0a%3c not have manifested in action, as there are no boundaries in creation, in which %0a%3c actions could be revealed. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, Aba issues a command that designates the passage of Light from %0a%3c him to Ima. However, since this is merely a command, and not an action (like a %0a%3c force instead of an action), the future tense is used. The same language is used %0a%3c in the description of man's creation: AND THE CREATOR SAID, "LET US %0a%3c CREATE MAN." Note that the plural form is used: LET US CREATE. %0a%3c %0a%3c Before the creation of the world of Atzilut (called the world of correction), %0a%3c an action known as Shevirat HaKelim (the breaking of the vessels in the world %0a%3c of Nekudim) took place in the spiritual worlds. It is written: "The Creator %0a%3c kept creating and destroying worlds, until He created this world (Atzilut), and %0a%3c He told it to stop spreading below the boundaries in which it was created" %0a%3c (Beresheet Raba, 3:7). %0a%3c %0a%3c The breaking of the vessels was essential, for it was the only opportunity to %0a%3c mix the egoistic properties (desires) with the altruistic ones; after all, distance %0a%3c in the spiritual is determined by the disparity of properties (desires).

It uses %0a%3c the instructions of exposing and separating the egoistic Kelim from the altruistic %0a%3c ones, as, for instance, in the following verses: AND THE CREATOR DIVIDED %0a%3c LIGHT FROM DARKNESS; THE CREATOR DIVIDED WATERS FROM %0a%3c DRY LAND; THE CREATOR DIVIDED DAY FROM NIGHT, and so forth. %0a%3c All these examples speak of the separation of the pure forces from the impure %0a%3c ones, of good from evil.

As a %0a%3c result, death will disappear forever, and the Creator will manifest as the King of %0a%3c all creation. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, there is a great difference between the description of man's creation %0a%3c and that of all the other creatures and parts of creation. Here, the action itself %0a%3c was mixed with the instructions, for the instructions, descriptions come from %0a%3c Ima, not from Aba, who said, LET US CREATE MAN— together with Malchut %0a%3c of the world of Atzilut. %0a%3c %0a%3c The reason for this is that Malchut includes everything, for she also gives the %0a%3c Light of sustenance to the impure forces to keep them from disappearing from %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 430 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c the world, as, like all the other elements of creation, the impure forces cannot %0a%3c exist without Light, and immediately disappear. It is written in this regard: HER %0a%3c FEET DESCEND TO DEATH, for the impure forces receive a tiny spark of %0a%3c Light to sustain their existence. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is why Malchut is called Assiya (action), for she spreads and rules in the %0a%3c whole of creation. She is also called "darkness," for she shines with a spark of %0a%3c Light, to sustain the darkness and evil. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, when Ima unites with Malchut and their properties mix, she receives %0a%3c the properties of darkness, of which it is said: LET US CREATE MAN IN OUR %0a%3c IMAGE, AFTER OUR LIKENESS, for Light is called "image," and darkness is %0a%3c called "likeness." Indeed, after Ima mixes with Malchut, these two forces, IMAGE %0a%3c and LIKENESS, appear in her as well. As a result, man, who was created by her, %0a%3c contains these two forces— IMAGE and LIKENESS, too. %0a%3c %0a%3c From the phrase, LET US MAKE, it follows that Ima consists of two parts, %0a%3c male and female. Although Ima is a male part (giving is a male property), she is %0a%3c connected to Malchut. Besides, the male property suggests the presence of Light, %0a%3c while the property of Nukva (the female part) is poverty and darkness. %0a%3c %0a%3c And since Ima accepted Malchut as her partner with the purpose of creating %0a%3c man (accepted the properties of Malchut), she is now filled with poverty and %0a%3c darkness. It follows that man consists of the properties of Ima (wealth and Light), %0a%3c as well as of the properties of Malchut (poverty and darkness). %0a%3c %0a%3c And it is this precise combination of the properties of Ima and Malchut that %0a%3c enables man to correct Malchut, fill her with Light, and spread spiritual purity %0a%3c and holiness throughout the entire earth (Malchut). It is written that at the %0a%3c end of correction, "the Creator and His Name shall be one," for the darkness %0a%3c in Malchut will be transformed into Light, as in the male part, HaVaYaH. %0a%3c Everything will be as one in the male property, as it is said, "There will be no %0a%3c poor in your nation." %0a%3c %0a%3c This Mitzva says that as Ima united with Malchut so as to correct her, which %0a%3c is why Ima includes Image and Likeness, man needs to correct his qualities in %0a%3c order to correct the parts of darkness within him. To this end, he must diminish %0a%3c his properties, just like Ima, and give his part (charity) to the poor Malchut, who %0a%3c is deprived of Light. He must show mercy to the LIKENESS (poverty) within %0a%3c him, and provide it with everything it needs. %0a%3c %0a%3c By observing this Mitzva, man receives IMAGE and LIKENESS from Ima, %0a%3c the Upper Light that was received by Adam, created in IMAGE and LIKENESS. %0a%3c This is why he has the power to rule over all the animals in the world (all of his %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Ninth Commandment %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 431 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c animal desires) to such an extent that no impure force (desire) remains within %0a%3c him, which he cannot defeat and correct. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar gives the example of Navuchadnetzar (Nebuchadnezzar): although %0a%3c the Supreme verdict with regard to him was reached, his dream did not come %0a%3c true as long as he was merciful to the poor.
