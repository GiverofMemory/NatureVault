This indicates that the hive is ready to swarm, which means you should probably already have had an empty hive with empty frames in it with lemongrass essential oil so in case it does swarm you should catch it in your new hive.  But if you find your hive with queen cells before it swarms, then you can transfer half of the frames that contain queen cells and half of the brood frames to another hive.  You don't even need to find the queen, she should be in one of the hives and the other will make a new queen with the queen cells it has.%0a%0aIf you can't wait for queen cells you will need to make a split with at least 5 brood frames in each hive and they need to have very young brood with some at the egg stage so that the hive that does not get the queen will be able to make a queen out of one of the eggs.%0a%0a!!!Natural%0a%0aThe best possible method, which is a natural split, is to set a new hive out with frames and lemongrass essential oil.  Then let your hive(s) naturally swarm and move into your new hive.  Doing this is not only the least risky way of splitting a hive, but it also carries on their natural swarming ability in your colonies genetics.  This is important to strengthen genetics for bees to continue on in the future in your area.%0a%0a!!Disease%0a%0a!!!Colony collapse [[#colonycollapse]]%0awhy are honeybees dying [[https://www.naturalblaze.com/2022/12/why-are-honey-bees-dying-study-finds-bee-lifespans-50-shorter-than-50-years-ago.html|#]]%0a%0a!!!Varroa%0a%0aThymol typically used but better than thymol in order of selectivity to mites over bee death were peppermint or manuka, oregano or litsea, carrot or cinnamon [[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34821845/|#]].%0a%0aSome practical info on varroa and other pests and essential oils [[https://beekeepclub.com/using-essential-oils-with-honeybees/|#]]%0a%0aBeta glucan 0.5%25 like from oats reduces infection [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5102454/|#]]%0a%0aRaw [[onion]] and especially raw [[garlic]] very effective [[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/340786087_Garlic_Allium_sativum_L_and_Onion_Allium_cepa_L_as_a_Potent_Anti-mite_Varroa_destructor_Parasited_on_Honey_Bee_Apis_mellifera_L_in_Egypt|#]]%0a%0acauses deformed wing virus [[https://www.naturalblaze.com/2022/11/honeybee-lifespan-could-be-half-what-it-was-50-years-ago-new-study.html|#]]%0a%0a!!!Tracheal mite%0a%0a!!!!Treatment%0aEssential oils [[https://surrybeekeepers.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/EssentialOilsInBeekeeping161113.pdf|#]]%0a%0aRaw [[onion]] and especially raw [[garlic]] probably very effective based on varroa mite which seems to be similar [[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/340786087_Garlic_Allium_sativum_L_and_Onion_Allium_cepa_L_as_a_Potent_Anti-mite_Varroa_destructor_Parasited_on_Honey_Bee_Apis_mellifera_L_in_Egypt|#]]%0a%0a!!!Small hive beetle%0a%0aDamages comb, stored pollen, and discolors and ferments honey which smells like decaying oranges, with larvae burrowing through comb and can cause colony collapse disorder [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_hive_beetle|#]]%0a%0aAdult 5-6mm long [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_hive_beetle|#]]%0a%0aBees will abandon hive if problem gets bad enough [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_hive_beetle|#]]%0a%0aTraps that use natural bee products to bait and vegetable oil to kill [[https://beetlejail.com/products/beetle-jail-baitable|#]]%0a%0a!!!!Treatment%0a%0aWintergreen might be helpful [[https://surrybeekeepers.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/EssentialOilsInBeekeeping161113.pdf|#]]%0a%0aBeekeeper success with 1 TBSP [[eucalyptus]] oil per lb of crisco and putting on bottom boards and in all 4 corners of hive [[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=AN9-DC8odtA|#]]%0a%0a[[Peppermint]] candy [[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=mQpqawB65Sc|#]]%0a%0aRaw [[onion]] and especially [[garlic]] probably very effective based on varroa mite which seems to be similar [[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/340786087_Garlic_Allium_sativum_L_and_Onion_Allium_cepa_L_as_a_Potent_Anti-mite_Varroa_destructor_Parasited_on_Honey_Bee_Apis_mellifera_L_in_Egypt|#]]%0a%0aThyme also likely to help based on its effectiveness on varroa.

In many places it needs to be done at least every few years to prevent your bee forage from turning into a forest.  A [[forest garden]] can probably avoid the need to do this.%0a%0aShould be done when daily average high temperature is roughly 47 degrees or below (8 degrees from the 55 forage temp) and the low is above 32 (freezing) that way there should be no snow on the ground.  For [[Upstate NY farming]], this would be November 20th. This also happens to be around the time of the first snow, but snow doesn't stick until later in november or december. For an extra measure of certainty, and no significant loss of nectar flow, 11/11 also works which would be within 4 degrees of the 55 degree target.  November 4th in upstate ny is when the average high first drops below 55 degrees.  Bush hogging then is ultra-conservative and has a significant risk of loosing a weeks worth of [[#nectar|nectar]] flow, but this may be a tradeoff worth doing depending on weather forecast, relation to the [[grand solar minimum]] or other confounding factors or concerns.%0a%0aAnother factor aside from waiting until the nectar flow is over, is giving the plants a chance to distribute their seeds.  Some [[aster]]s seem to need much of fall to finish distributing the majority of their seeds.  [[Milkweed]] is pretty much done distributing their seeds by the second week of november. [[Goldenrod]] goes to seed in september but isn't finished distributing its seeds until after milkweed typically.  Of course bush hogging stops the process of seed dispersal and deposits all a plants seeds in its own immediate vicinity.%0a%0aInstead of bush hogging in the fall, you can always wait until after the melt in spring but this risks wet and muddy conditions which should be avoided if possible because bush hogging in the mud will disturb the seeds that were scattered in the previous fall.%0a%0a!!!Sheltering [[#shelter]]%0a%0aBees should be sheltered from any times that the temperature drops to 23f [[#temp|temp]], especially if that day the high never makes it above 23f for the bees to recover.  Liberal date range to shelter bees in [[Upstate NY farming]] would be december 1st until march 20th.  Conservative would be december 21st (first day of winter) until March 1st (20 days until the beginning of spring).%0a%0aBees use condensation from in the hive during winter for water [[https://backyardbeekeeping.iamcountryside.com/health-pests/what-happens-to-bees-in-the-winter/|#]] they probably also leave some honey uncapped and undried.%0a%0a!!Temperature [[#temp]]%0a**23-44-55-101010 rule:** ''bees shiver at 23f outside air temp (OAT) or below so they are burning through honey stores when it is that cold.  They need 44f OAT or above to take cleansing flights, and 55f OAT or above to forage. They stop foraging above 100f OAT and cannot fly when OAT is 110f or higher.''%0a%0aTemperatures, bees maintain 75-93f cluster temp, hive temp is not maintained.

All temps measured is outside air temp unless specified. 57-100f bees forage, below 55 they don't leave the hive and don't fly well if they do.  No flying outside the 50-110f range.  64f start clustering, 57f tighter cluster. 23f begin vibrating [[shivering]]. 95f is optimum winter cluster core temp which is normal bee internal temp, 81f is average cluster core temp, 48f is average temp of outer layer of cluster. Min viable cluster core temp is 55f, and minimum cluster outer layer temp somewhere between 44-46f. Max core temp around 100f.  Heater bees can keep 70 cells warm and the heater bees can reach 111f. Cleansing flights (pooping) occur 44f or above as they can tolerate short fights but if the bees internal temp drops to 50 paralysis begins and their muscles can't move at all when internal temp hits 45f [[https://www.beepods.com/honey-bees-survive-winter-regulating-temperature-cluster/|#]]%0a%0a%0a!!Hive%0a%0aAttach:langdims.png%0a%0aI have seen hives with only 18" of space and frames 17 13/16" long which means bee space is not respected in some iterations of langstroth hives; which leads to frames getting stuck and prying frames leading to queen death.%0a%0aOnline ruler [[https://www.ginifab.com/feeds/cm_to_inch/actual_size_ruler.html|#]]%0a%0aTypes of hive including traditional designs [[https://liveandletbee.org/hive-types/|#]]%0a%0aWhy windows are bad [[https://www.thewarrestore.com/the-thruth-about-windows|#]]%0a%0aCedar and pine are acceptable woods [[https://www.thewarrestore.com/what-sets-us-apart|#]]%0a%0aHorizontal hive beekeeping books [[https://horizontalhive.com/|#]]%0a%0aLayens horizontal hive, the worlds first horizontal design [[https://horizontalhive.com/how-to-build/layens-beehive-design.shtml|#]]and more horizontal hive plans [[https://horizontalhive.com/how-to-build/hive-frame-swarm-trap.shtml|#]] layens uses 1.5" wide touching frame top bars like we do [[https://horizontalhive.com/how-to-build/layens-hive-frame-plans.shtml|#]], but for some reason they don't want the ends of the top bar to be 3/4" unlike ours, which just makes Layen frames more work and more fragile frames.  Also Layens is not backward or cross compatible to standard hives unlike ours since thier top bar is only ~15" long not 19" standard, which makes adoption struggle because you can't build a hive by buying a standard nuke or by using frames from another hive.  I understand that they feel deeper and narrower is better, and it might be slightly preferred by bees (but probably not because the bees rarely fill comb below 2/3 from the top of the 16" deep frame, which is around the [[#moose|MOOSE]] depth, 10.5") but the lack of backwards compatibility to me is impossible to integrate since the whole industry uses the 19" standard.  It is like designing a train that uses a different width track.  Also one problem is it probably needs full frames because the comb is so long (~16") and the attachment at the top is more narrow and thus has less support, whereas with a 19" frame we can just use frame-less top bars which saves huge amounts of work.%0a%0aFree horizontal hive design and instructions [[https://horizontalhive.com/how-to-build/long-langstroth-plans.shtml|#]] but much more skill and precision cuts needed compared to [[#moose|MOOSE hive]]%0a%0aGolden mean 120 deg base angles and hive dimensions of 33"x19"x10" [[https://backyardhive.com/products/the-golden-mean-hive-passage-bars?variant=51891286677|#]] and cathedral [[https://backyardhive.com/products/the-cathedral-hive|#]] [[https://backyardhive.com/pages/building-tips-for-the-cathedral-hive-plans|#]] are good designs.%0a%0aComplete standard dimensions frames [[https://www.michiganbees.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Frames_20140701.pdf|#]] hive body [[http://www.michiganbees.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Hive-Bodies_20110323.pdf|#]] and more [[https://www.michiganbees.org/beekeeping/in-the-beekeepers-workshop/|#]] [[https://bee-health.extension.org/wooden-components-of-a-modern-bee-hive/|#]] [[https://beeprofessor.com/langstroth-hive-dimensions/|#]] [[https://devonbeekeepers.org.uk/hive-dimensions/|#]]%0a%0aBee space [[https://bee-health.extension.org/what-is-bee-space-and-why-is-this-important-to-beekeeping/|#]] Langstroth bees build excess comb in a space greater than 3/8 inch. Bees fill any space under than 1/4 inch with propolis. So space between 3/8 inch and 1/4 inch is in a range of "acceptable" bee space, with 5/16 inch an average that is most acceptable by beekeepers. A Langstroth hive would have a 5/16- or 3/8 bee space.  However some bees make more space for themselves in order to moove freely.  Usually between 3/8 and 3/4 [[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/327347604_Determination_of_bee_spacing_and_comb_cell_dimensions_for_Apis_mellifera_Scutellata_honeybee_race_in_western_Ethiopia|#]] however going above 3/8 you may have some stray comb.%0a%0aOptimum bee space may change based on genetics or hive design or altitude [[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/327347604_Determination_of_bee_spacing_and_comb_cell_dimensions_for_Apis_mellifera_Scutellata_honeybee_race_in_western_Ethiopia|#]]%0a%0aDimensions of hive spaces [[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317357440_Determination_of_Bee_Space_and_Cell_Dimensions_for_Jimma_Zone_Honeybee_Eco-Races_Apis_malifera_Southwest_Ethiopian|#]]%0a%0aAir gaps that will be filled with propolis should be 1/4 inch or less preferably 3/16".

Gaps are for ventilation, smaller than 1/4 inch (3/16") so the bees will fill with propolis if they want to, and they can just barely fit through [[https://www.beesource.com/threads/smallest-hole-a-bee-can-get-through.244943/|#]] it if they need to get to the top to cool the hive with thier wings.  In warm-year-long climates, you can line the gaps up with eachother which makes 3/8" so they will not fill the gaps.  The groove on top and bottom (so they can be flipped) is to put a thin board in (lets call it a starter board) so the bees can make the comb starting there and make it straight.  The top bar is 1.5" wide which is more than standard 1.375" for more bee space which is data driven based on natural hive measurements.  Yes they might add some comb between but this gives them quicker movement and more efficiency and allows these master builder insects to have more agency.  The grooves in the top bar can also be used to hold a sheet of wood to make a false end of the hive or a queen separator for there to only be honey frames beyond it.  Each frame full of honey should be at least 10 lbs so letting the bees keep 4 honey frames (40 lbs) will be enough for them to make it through the winter without feeding or with minimal feeding. **Optional**: If you only want 1 middle groove cut per bar, then you can make the bars ~0.7" thick instead of 0.75" which means you can cut 5 per 19" section of 2x4 instead of only 4.  This option is also the way to go if you want to use these top bars in a standard hive.  Pros and cons of making one sided (only one 1/8" groove per bar): you gain economics and cross compatibility at the cost of a bit of quality and adaptability.%0a%0a#**Starter board design** [[Attach:starterboard.pdf|Starter Board drawing]]. 17.75 is the typical length but I want it to still work if you don't center it in the groove perfectly so made it 17.5 in.  The holes need to be at least 5/16" I made them 1/2 inch.  Also since it recesses 3/16 deep into the groove, even the top hole will have 5/16 inch so bees can get through.  It was made to basically break in half, each side is the same and you can just make them one sided and put two together for each top bar.  It is angled up in the middle to help give the bees some angles, they seem to struggle with straight lines.%0a%0a#**Horizontal top Bar hive design** [[Attach:MOOSE-beehive.pdf|Horizontal Top Bar Hive (MOOSE) drawing]].  In addition to bieng made to use the top bar frames outlined above, it is also fully compatible with any depth standard hive frames which is perfect when you want to add bees to the hive from another hive you have.  **Cutlist** (see also [[#moosenotes|notes]] below): 13x 35 inch long 2x4's and 35x 24 inch long 2x4's.  2x4's are actually 1.5" x 3.5".  This 1.5" thickness, along with good sealing of all cracks including the lid (aside from the designed slots and ventillation holes) is critical for the hive to survive outdoors in the winter.  The slots can be reduced for the winter but the ventillation holes should stay open so the hive doesn't condense moisture and freeze.  Putting a tarp over it (or stapling flashing to the lid) in the winter to keep rain off it even more, is probably a good idea.  The hive design has legs which gets it off the wet ground and so less surface area for ants or other bugs to climb up.  Also can put some lanolin on the legs to deter climbing insects like [[ant]] [[http://www.greynomadsaustralia.com.au/index.php/blog/3-general/5598-ants-and-lock-lubrication|#]].  A couple modifications that may help, you can replace the 6" long slots with 16 x 3/8" holes for each slot you are replacing as this will prevent mouse entry and also reduce drafts in the winter.  You can put a few nails in the slot to prevent mouse entry too.  Also the legs can be 35" instead of 24" especially if you want to stack these (which is possible but you will need to know what you are doing and have them on a cement slab and the legs need to be braced and connected together).  35" legs will allow you to access lower hives while they are stacked.  [[#fill]]The inside corners (the 4 corners and interior edges at the bottom) should be filled with wax or propolis and/or 45Â° cut wood [[#glue|glued in with natural glue]].  The reason for this is that corners are unnatural to hives and this is how mites evade the bees from removing them.%0a%0a[[#glue]]Gum arabic glycerine natural glue [[https://www.hunker.com/12586485/how-to-make-a-homemade-superglue|#]] probably can use powdered propolis as a substitute for some or all of the gum arabic since propolis contains 50%25 plant resins. 3 TBSP gum arabic powder, 1 TBSP glycerine, 1/2 tsp (or Tbsp?) water.

Use this to glue boards together (in addition to using screws or nails) and fill any gaps from imperfectly cut boards.  Bees can also fill in any imperfections as they can access nearly all joints.  Pine pitch spruce glue [[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=taBdsSFyJsY|#]] could also work.

They should be untreated.  Make sure they are 96" and not 92". At standard length of 8 ft each, you will need 14 of them, which at $5 each [[https://www.homedepot.com/p/2-in-x-4-in-x-8-ft-Prime-Whitewood-Stud-058449/312528776|#]] sets you back around $70 plus the price of screws.  The boards should be very straight and not bowed so that everything lines up.  You can get exactly 4 x 24" pieces per each 8ft board.  Also you can get 2 x 35" plus one 24" per board with only 2" left over.  These 2x4's can also be sliced into 1.5" x 3/4" x 19" pieces to make the top bars.  23 top bars are needed to fill the hive, of which 20 can be made from a single 2x4 (or 25 if you make them with only 1 middle groove and therefore they can be ~0.7" thick).%0a%0aIf you want to use less and larger pieces of wood you can't use off the shelf sizes like 2x8 in this build because they are not perfect multiples of 2x4's.  If you use 2x8's to replace sets of two 2x4's you will need to take 1/4" off of them since they are 7.25" wide while a 2x4 is 3.5" wide [[https://www.prowoodlumber.com/en/Projects-and-Resources/Common-Lumber-Dimensions|#]].%0a%0aCuts should be very straight however as you can see from the plans many of the ends are not butted up against others so these can be less perfectly cut.%0a%0aIf you give the following cutlist to Home Depot or a store like it, they may cut them all to size for you for free.

If the bees realize quickly they have no queen, they will convert open larvae from the frames into a queen.  If they don't, just wait and introduce another fresh larvae comb (that contains eggs or just hatched egg larvae) into the hive again after a couple weeks and they should convert one of those larvae or egg into a queen.%0a%0aLanolin can be spread around the top ventillation holes to prevent ants from going in.  Also as mentioned before lanolin can be placed on the legs to help prevent ants and other insects from walking up.%0a%0a!!Honey harvest%0a%0aHoney should probably be harvested in mid August, perhaps august ~15th to have honey by the 3rd saturday (somewhere within 15th-21st) in august (national bee day), this gives time from them to use up old honey, make new honey, and be able to compensate for the raid by getting more honey in fall.

In addition to bieng made to use the top bar frames outlined above, it is also fully compatible with any depth standard hive frames which is perfect when you want to add bees to the hive from another hive you have.  **Cutlist** (see also [[#moosenotes|notes]] below): 13x 35 inch long 2x4's and 35x 24 inch long 2x4's.  2x4's are actually 1.5" x 3.5".  This 1.5" thickness, along with good sealing of all cracks including the lid (aside from the designed slots and ventillation holes) is critical for the hive to survive outdoors in the winter.  The slots can be reduced for the winter but the ventillation holes should stay open so the hive doesn't condense moisture and freeze.  Putting a tarp over it (or stapling flashing to the lid) in the winter to keep rain off it even more, is probably a good idea.  The hive design has legs which gets it off the wet ground and so less surface area for ants or other bugs to climb up.  Also can put some lanolin on the legs to deter climbing insects like [[ant]] [[http://www.greynomadsaustralia.com.au/index.php/blog/3-general/5598-ants-and-lock-lubrication|#]].  A couple modifications that may help, you can replace the 6" long slots with 16 x 3/8" holes for each slot you are replacing as this will prevent mouse entry and also reduce drafts in the winter.  You can put a few nails in the slot to prevent mouse entry too.  Also the legs can be 35" instead of 24" especially if you want to stack these (which is possible but you will need to know what you are doing and have them on a cement slab and the legs need to be braced and connected together).  35" legs will allow you to access lower hives while they are stacked.  [[#fill]]The inside corners (the 4 corners and interior edges at the bottom) should be filled with wax or propolis and/or 45Â° cut wood [[#glue|glued in with natural glue]].

Bees fill any space under than 1/4 inch with propolis. So space between 3/8 inch and 1/4 inch is in a range of "acceptable" bee space, with 5/16 inch an average that is most acceptable by beekeepers. A Langstroth hive would have a 5/16- or 3/8 bee space.  However some bees make more space for themselves in order to moove freely.  Usually between 3/8 and 3/4 [[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/327347604_Determination_of_bee_spacing_and_comb_cell_dimensions_for_Apis_mellifera_Scutellata_honeybee_race_in_western_Ethiopia|#]] however going above 3/8 you may have some stray comb.%0a---%0a> Bee space [[https://bee-health.extension.org/what-is-bee-space-and-why-is-this-important-to-beekeeping/|#]]%0a
