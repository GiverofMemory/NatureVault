[[#chap1]]%0a%0aNature and the earth might have well filled the measure of %0aour admiration, if we had nothing else to do but to consider %0athe properties enumerated in the preceding Book, and the nu¬ %0amerous varieties of plants that we find created for the wants %0aor the enjoyment of mankind. And yet, how much is there %0astill left for us to describe, and how many discoveries of a still %0amore astonishing nature ! The greater part, in fact, of the %0aplants there mentioned recommend themselves to us by their %0ataste, their fragrance, or their beauty, and so invite us to %0amake repeated trials of their virtues: but, on the other hand, %0athe properties of those which remain to be de.scribed, furnish %0aus with abundant proof that nothing has been created by Nature %0awithout some purpose to fulfil, unrevealed to us though it %0amay be. %0a%0a!!CHAP. 2.

That, %0aamong some barbarous peoples, the females^ stain the face by %0ameans of various plants, there can be little doubt, and among %0atlie Daci and the Sarmatse we find the men even marking^ their %0abodies. There is a plant in Gaul, similar to the plantago in %0aappearance, and known there by the name of “ glastum %0a%0a* Fee remarks, that at the present day, in all savage nations in which %0atatooing is practised, the men display more taste and care in the operation %0athan is shewn by the females. There is little doubt that it is the art of %0atatooing the body, or in other words, first puncturing it and then rubbing %0ain various colours, that is here spoken of by Pliny. %0a%0a2 “ Inscribiint.” “Writing upon,” or “tatooing," evidently. %0a%0a3 Our “ woad,” the Isatis tinctoria of Linnmus, which imparts a blue %0a%0a%0a390 %0a%0a%0aPLIirr’s NATURAL HISTORY. %0a%0a%0a[Book XXII. %0a%0a%0awith it both matrons and girls^ among the people of Britain %0aare in the habit of staining the body all over, when taking %0apart in the performance of certain sacred rites; rivalling %0ahereby the swarthy hue of the ^Ethiopians, they go in a state %0aof nature. %0a%0a!!CHAP. 3. (2.) —EMPLOYMENT OF PLANTS FOR UYEING. EXPLANA¬TION OF THE TEEMS SAGMEN, VEKBENA, AND CLARIGATIO. [[#chap3]]%0a%0aWe know, too, that from plants are extracted admirable %0acolours for dyeing; and, not to mention the berries® of Galatia,® %0aAfrica, and Lusitania, which furnish the coccus, a dye re¬ %0aserved for the military costume’' of our generals, the people of %0aGaul beyond the Alps produce the Tyrian colours, the conchy- %0aliated,® and all the other hues, by the agency of plants® alone. %0aThey have not there to seek the murex at the bottom of the %0asea, or to expose themselves to be the prey of the monsters of %0athe deep, while tearing it from their jaws, nor have they to go %0asearching in depths to which no anchor has penetrated—and %0aall this for the purpose of finding the means whereby some %0amother of a family may appear more charming in the eyes of %0aher paramour, or the seducer may make himself more captivat¬ %0aing to the wife of another man. Standing on dry land, the %0apeople there gather in their dyes just as we do our crops of %0a%0acolour. The root of this Celtic wood is probably “ glas,” “blue,” whence %0aalso our word “glass and it is not improbable that the name of glass %0awas given to it from the blue tints which it presented. Julius Caesar and %0aPomponius Mela translate this word “ glastum,” by the Latin “ vitrum,” %0a“glass.” %0a%0a“Conjuges nurusque.” Caesar says that the people in Britain were %0ain the habit of staining the body with woad, to add to the horror of their %0aappearance in battle. Pomponius Mela expresses himself as uncertain for %0awhat purpose it was done, whether it was to add to their beauty, or for %0asome other reasons to him unknown. %0a%0a® “ Granis.” What the ancients took to be a vegetable substance, is %0anow known to be an insect, the kermes of the Quercus coccifera. %0a%0a* See B. ix. c. 63. %0a%0a’ “ Paludamentis.” The “ paludamentum” was the cloak worn by a %0aRoman general when in command, his principal officers, and personal at¬ %0atendants. It was open in front, reached to the knees or thereabout, and %0ahung over the shoulders, being fastened across the chest by a clasp. It %0awas commonly white or purple. %0a%0a® For an account of all these colours see B. ix. cc. 60—65. %0a%0a® The vaccinium for instance.

Still, however, I should not have %0aomitted to enlarge upon the art of dyeing, had I found that it %0ahad ever been looked upon as forming one of our liberal'® arts. %0aMeantime, I shall be actuated by higher considerations, and %0ashall proceed to show in what esteem we are bound to hold %0athe mute'® plants even, or in other words, the plants of little %0anote. For, indeed, the authors and founders of the Roman %0asway have derived from these very plants even almost bound¬ %0aless results; as it was these same plants, and no others, that %0aafforded them the “ sagmen,”'^ employed in seasons of public %0acalamity, and the “ verbena” of our sacred rites and embassies. %0aThese two names, no doubt, originally signified the same thing, %0a—a green turf torn up from the citadel with the earth attached %0ato it; and hence, when envoys were dispatched to the enemy %0afor the purpose of clarigation, or, in other words, with the %0aobject of clearlif^ demanding restitution of property that had %0abeen carried off, one of these officers was always known as %0athe “ verbenarius.”'® %0a%0aFee thinks that the art of dyeing with alkanet and madder may he %0ahere alluded to. " See B. xxxv. c. 1. %0a%0aThe “good,” “ingenuous,” or “liberal” arts were those which might %0abe practised by free men without loss of dignity. Pliny is somewhat in¬ %0aconsistent here, for he makes no scruple at enlarging upon the art of me¬ %0adicine, which among the Romans was properly not a liberal, but a servile, %0aart. %0a%0a“Sardis.” %0a%0aFestus says the “ verbenae,” or pure herbs, were called “sagmina,” %0abecause they were taken from a sacred (sacer) place. It is more generally %0asupposed that “ sagmen” comes from “ sancio,” to render inviolable,” %0atile person of the bearer being looked upon as inviolable. %0a%0ats “ Clare.” %0a%0a18 Or bearer of the “ verbena.” See further on this subject in B. xxv. %0ac. 69. %0a%0a%0a392 %0a%0a%0aflint’s natural history. %0a%0a%0a[Book XXI I. %0a%0a%0a!!CHAP. 4. (3.)— the grass crown : how rarely it has been AWARDED. [[#chap4]]%0a%0aOf all the crowns with which, in the days of its majesty, %0athe all-sovereign people, the ruler of the earth, recompensed %0athe valour of its citizens, there was none attended with higher %0aglory than the crown of grass.'"' The crowns'® bedecked with %0agems of gold, the vallar, mural, rostrate, civic, and triumphal %0acrowns, were, all of them, inferior to this; great, indeed, was %0athe difference between them, and far in the background were %0athey thrown by it. As to all the rest, a single individual %0acould confer them, a general or commander on his soldiers for %0ainstance, or, as on some occasions, on his colleague : the senate, %0atoo, exempt from the cares and anxieties of war, and the people %0ain the enjoyment of repose, could award them, together with %0athe honours of a triumph. %0a%0a(4.) But as for the crown of grass, it was never conferred %0aexcept at a crisis of extreme desperation, never voted except %0aby the acclamation of the whole array, and never to any one %0abut to him who had been its preserver. Other crowns were %0aawarded by the generals to the soldiers, this alone by the %0asoldiers, and to the general. This crown is known also as the %0a“ obsidional” crown, from the circumstance of a beleaguered %0aarmy being delivered, and so preserved from fearful disaster. %0aIf we are to regard* as a glorious and a hallowed reward the %0acivic crown, presented for preserving the life of a single citizen, %0aand him, perhaps, of the very humblest rank, what, pray, ought %0ato be thought of a whole army being saved, and indebted for its %0apreservation to the valour of a single individual ? %0a%0aThe crown thus presented was made of green grass,'® %0agathered on the spot where the troops so rescued had been %0abeleaguered. Indeed, in early times, it wms the usual token of %0avictory for the vanquished to present to the conqueror a handful %0aof grass ; signifying thereby that they surrendered®® their na¬ %0ative soil, the land that had nurtured them, and the very right %0aeven there to be interred—a usage which, to my own know¬ %0aledge, still exists among the nations of Germany.®' %0a%0a“ Corona graminea.” %0a%0a'® For a description of these various crowns, see B. xvi. c. 3. %0a%0aSometimes also, weeds, or wild flowers. %0a%0aSee Servius on the Alneid, B. viii. 1. 128. %0a%0aNo doubt, the old English custom of delivering seisin by presenting %0aa turf, originated in this. %0a%0a%0aClap. 5.] PERSONS PRESENTED WITH THE GRASS CROWN. 393 %0a%0a%0a!!CHAP. 5. (5.) -THE ONLY PERSONS THAT HAYE BEEN PRESENTED WITH THIS CROWN. [[#chap5]]%0a%0aL. Siccius Dentatus^^ was presented with this crown but %0aonce, though iie gained as many as fourteen civic crowns, and %0afought one hundred and twenty battles, in all of which he was %0avictorious—so rarely is it that an army has to thank a single %0aindividual only for its preservation! Some generals, how¬ %0aever, have been presented with more than one of these crowns, %0aP. Decius Mus,*® the military tribune, for example, who re¬ %0aceived one from his own army, and another from the troops %0awhich he had rescued^* when surrounded. He testified by an %0aact of devoutness in what high esteem he held such an honour %0aas this, for, adorned with these insignia, he sacrificed a white %0aox to Mars, together with one hundred red oxen, which had %0abeen presented to him by the beleaguered troops as the recom¬ %0apense of his valour : it was this same Decius, who afterwards, %0awhen consul, with Imperiosus^® for his colleague, devoted his %0ahfe to secure victory to his fellow-citizens. %0a%0aThis crown was presented also by the senate and people of %0aRome—a distinction than which I know of nothing in exist¬ %0aence more glorious—to that same Fabius*® who restored the %0afortunes of Rome by avoiding a battle; not, however, on the %0aoccasion when he preserved the master of the horse*^ and his %0aarmy ; for then it was deemed preferable by those who were %0aindebted to him for their preservation to present him with a %0acrown under a new title, that of “ father.” The crown of %0agrass was, however, awarded to him, with that unanimity %0awhich I have mentioned, after Hannibal had been expelled %0afrom Ital}^; being the only crown, in fact, that has hitherto %0abeen placed upon the head of a citizen by the hands of the %0astate itself, and, another remarkable distinction, the only one %0athat has ever been conferred by the whole of Italy united. %0a%0a“ See B. vii. c. 29.

[[#chap6]]%0a%0aIn addition to the persons already mentioned, the honour %0aof this crown has been awarded to M. Calpurnius Flarama,^ %0athen a military tribune in Sicily ; but up to the present time %0ait has been given to a single centurion only, Cneius Petreius %0aAtinas, during the war with the Cimbri. This soldier, while %0aacting as primipilus*® under Catulus, on finding all retreat for %0aIds legion cut off by the enemy, harangued the troops, and %0aafter slaying his tribune who hesitated to cut a way through the %0aencampment of the enemy, brought away the legion in safety. %0aI find it stated also by some authors, that, in addition to this %0ahonour, this same Petreius, clad in the praetexta, offered sacri¬ %0afice at the altar, to the sound of the pipe,®® in presence of the %0athen consuls,®* Marius and Catulus. %0a%0aThe Dictator S 5 dla has also stated in his memoirs, that when %0alegatus in the Marsic War he wms presented with this crown %0aby the army, atNola; an event which he caused to be com¬ %0amemorated in a painting at his Tusculan villa, which after¬ %0awards became the property of Cicero. If there is any truth %0ain this statement, I can only say that it renders his memory %0aall the more execrable, and that, by his proscriptions, with his %0aown hand he tore this crown from his brow, for few indeed %0awere the citizens whom he thus preserved, in comparison with %0athose he slaughtered at a later period. And let him even add %0ato this high honour his proud surname of “ Felix,”®® if he will; %0aall the glories of this crown he eurrendered to Sertorius, from %0athe moment that he put his proscribed fellow-citizens in a %0astage of siege throughout the whole world. %0a%0aVarro, too, relates that Scipio ^milianus was awarded the %0aobsidional crown in Africa, under the consul Manilius,®® for the %0apreservation of three cohorts, by bringing as many to their %0arescue; an event commemorated by an inscription upon the %0abase of the statue erected in honour of him by the now deified %0aEmperor Augustus, in the Forum which bears his name.

Beyond these, I do not %0afind any one mentioned as having been rewarded with this %0ahonour. %0a%0a!!CHAP. 7.- IIKMEDIES DERIVED PROM OTHER CHAPLET PLANTS. [[#chap7]]%0a%0aNo plant^® in particular was employed in the composition of %0athis crown, such only being used as were found growing on %0athe spot so imperilled; and thus did they become the means, %0ahowever humble and unnoted themselves, of conferring high %0ahonour and renown. All this, however, is but little known %0aamong us at the present day; a fact which I am the less sur¬ %0aprised at, when I reflect that those plants even are treated %0awith the same indifference, the purpose of which it is to pre¬ %0aserve our health, to allay our bodily pains, and to repel the %0aadvances of death ! And who is there that would not visit %0awith censure, and justly visit, the manners of the present day ? %0aLuxury and effeminacy have augmented the price at which %0awe live, and never was life more hankered after, or worse %0acared®’ for, than it is at present. This, however, w'e look upon %0aas the business of others, forsooth ; other persons must see to it, %0a■VN’ithout our troubling ourselves to request them, and the ph)'- %0asicians must exercise the necessary providence in our behalves. ® %0aAs for ourselves, we go on enjoying our pleasures, and are con¬ %0atent to live—a thing that in my opinion reflects the highest %0apossible disgrace—by putting faith in others.®® %0a%0aNay, even more than this, we ourselves are held in derision %0aby many, for undertaking these researches, and are chaiged %0a■v\dth busying ourselves with mere frivolities! It is some %0asolace, however, in the prosecution of these our boundless %0alabours, to have Nature as our sharer in this contempt .

Here, how¬ %0aever, she has devised another class of plants, bristling and re¬ %0apulsive to the sight, and dangerous to the touch; so much so, %0aindeed, that we fancy we all but hear the voice of her who %0amade them as she I’eveals to us her motives for so doing. It is %0aher wish, she says, that no ravening cattle may browse upon %0athem, that no wanton hand may tear them up, that no heed¬ %0aless footstep may tread them down, that no bird, perching there, %0amay break them : and in thus fortifying them with thorns, and %0a^ arming them with weapons, it has been her grand object %0ato save and protect the remedies which they afford to man. %0aThus we see, the very qualities even which we hold in such %0aaversion, have been devised by Nature for the benefit and ad¬ %0avantage of mankind. %0a%0a!!CHAP. 8.

Por stings and bites of %0athis nature, the root is taken in Avine in doses of one drachma, %0aor if, as generally is the case, the wound is attended with %0afever, in water.

But the more general opinion is %0athat it is the eringo, or Eryngium campestre of Linnaeus. It derives its %0aname from the Greek spfvytiv, from its asserted property of dispelling %0aflatulent eructations. It is possessed in reality of few medicinal proper¬ %0aties, and is only used occasionally, at the present day, as a diuretic.

(8.)—THE EBrHGIUir, CALLED CENTUM CAPITA : THIRTY REMEDIES. [[#chap9]]%0a%0aThe wliite variety of the eryngium is kno-wu in our lan¬ %0aguage as the “centum capita.”^® It has all the properties above- %0amentioned, and the Greeks employ both the stalk and the root %0aas an article of food,®® either boiled or ra-w. There are some %0amarvellous facts related in connexion -with this plant; the root®’ %0a%0aSee B. xxvii. c. 2. %0a%0aBy the Avord “toxica,” Poinsinet would understand, not poisons in %0ageneral, but the venom of the toad, which was called, he says, in the %0aCeltic and Celto-Scythic languages, toussac and tossa. Fee ridicules the %0anotion. %0a%0aOr rather. Fee says, deep blue. He identifies this with the Eryngium %0acyaneum of Linnaeus, the eringo, with a blue flower. %0a%0aThis, as well as the next, is identical, probably, Avith the Eryngium %0amaritimum of Linnaeus; our sea-holly. Tlie species found in Greece, in %0aaddition to the above; are the Eryngium tricuspidatum, multifidum, and %0aparviflorum. %0a%0aPliny probably makes a mistake here, and reads afXivov, “ parsley,” %0afor (TKoXvfiog, a “ thistle.” Dalecbamps is of this opinion, from an ex¬ %0aamination of the leaf; and Brotier adopts it. %0a%0aOr “ hundred heads,” the ordinary Eryngium campestre of Linnaeus, %0aIt is still called panicaut a cent tetes, by the French. %0a%0a‘o It is no longer used for this purpose ; but Fee is of opinion that it %0aowes its French name of “ panicaut,” from having been used in former %0atimes as a substitute for bread—juam. %0a%0a** It is not improbable that this plant is the same as the mandrake of %0aGenesis, c. xxx. 14 ; which is said to have borne some resemblance to the %0ahuman figure, and is spoken of by the commentators as male and female. %0a%0a%0a393 %0a%0a%0aPLINY's NATCJEAL niSTOEY. %0a%0a%0a[Book XXII. %0a%0a%0aof it, it is said, bears a strong resemblance to the organs of %0aeither sex ; it is but rarely found, but if a root resembling the %0amale organs should happen to fall in the way of a man, it %0awill ensure him woman’s love; hence it is that Phaon the %0aLesbian was so passionately beloved®^ by Sappho. Upon this %0asubject, too, there have been numerous other revex’ies, not only %0aon the part of the Magi, but of Pythagorean philosophers even %0aas well. %0a%0aSo far as its medicinal properties are concerned, in addition %0ato those already mentioned, this plant, taken in hydroineJ, is %0agood for flatulency, gripings of the bowels, diseases of the %0aheart, stomach, liver, and thoracic organs, and, taken in o.vy- %0acrate, for affections of the spleen. Mixed with hydromel, it is %0arecommended also for diseases of the kidneys, strangury, opistho- %0atony, spasms, lumbago, dropsy, epilepsy, suppression or excess of %0athe catamenia, and all maladies of the uterus. Applied with %0ahoney, it extracts foreign substances from the body, and, with %0asalted axle-grease and cerate, it disperses scrofulous sores, im- %0aposthumes of the pai’otid glands, inflamed tumours, denudations %0aof the bones, and fractures. Taken before drinking, it pre¬ %0avents the fumes of wine from rising to the head, and it arrests %0alooseness of the bowels. Some of our authors have recom¬ %0amended that this plant should be gathered at the period of %0athe summer solstice, and that it should be applied, in combi¬ %0anation with rain water, for all kinds of maladies of the neck. %0aThey say too, that, attached as an amulet to the person, it is a %0acure for albugo.®^ %0a%0a!!CHAP. 10.

The best kind is that %0agrown in Cilicia, and the next best that of Pontus; the root %0aof it is sweet, and this is the only part that is used.

Mixed %0awith salt, also, it is employed for the cure of cancers and foul %0aulcers ; and, applied in a similar manner, it cures sprains and %0ainflamed tumours, as well as imposthumes of the parotid glands %0aand denudations of the bones. The seed of it, taken with / %0aboiled must, dispels hysterical suffocations, and, applied topi-V' %0acally, it arrests mucous discharges of the nostrils. Taken with %0ahydromel, after dinner, in doses of two oboli, the seed pro¬ %0aduces a gentle vomit ;®^ and a dose of one obolus, taken in %0awine, has the effect of dispelling lassitude. The seed is pre¬ %0ascribed also, parched, and in dorses of one acetabulum, for %0aaffections of the uterus; and, taken in boiled®® must, it is a %0aremedy for flatulency of the stomach. Taken in an electuary, %0awith honey, it gives relief in hardness of breathing, and %0aclears the chest by expectoration : applied with linseed, it is a %0acure for pains in the side, with the addition of some hyssop %0aand a little pepper. The seed is employed also in the form of %0aa liniment for affections of the spleen, and, parched and taken %0awith the food, it acts as a laxative in [[NatureVault/constipation]] of the bowels. %0aHippocrates®® says that the seed, taken in drink, acts as a pur¬ %0agative upon the uterus; and that taken, parched, with sweet %0awine, in doses of one acetabulum, or applied externally with %0ajuice of mallows, it alleviates pains in that organ. He %0astates also that, used with hydromel and salt, it expels intes¬ %0atinal worms, and that a liniment made of the seed will restore %0athe hair when falling off. Many persons, too, employ the seed %0atopically, with old oil, for diseases of the joints, and for gout, %0aor else the leaves beaten up with bears’-grease : the root, too, %0apounded in vinegar, is no less useful for the same purposes, as %0a%0a®^ The process of “ urtication.” alluded to in Note %0a%0aFee considers this extremely doubtful. %0a%0a®* An abominable refinement (if we may use the term) in gluttony, %0awhich would appear to have been practised among the Romans; though %0aFee thinks it possible that such a practice may have been considered ad¬ %0avisable in the medical treatment of certain maladies.

The leaves are used for the cure of the various %0amaladies above mentioned, as also, boiled in wine, for scrofu¬ %0alous sores, inflamed tumours, and ulcers of the face. The ashes %0aof the root are a remedy for alopecy and chaps on the feet; %0aand an extract of the root, boiled in oil, is good for burns and %0achilblains.

Chewed, the root promotes vomiting, but the %0aseed, taken internally, disorders the bowels. %0a%0aChrj sermus used to employ a decoction of the root, in wine, %0afor imposthumes of the parotid glands ; and he has prescribed %0ait, in combination with cachrys,®® in wine, for the cure of %0ascrofulous sores. Some persons say that if, after applying the %0aroot to the sores, a part of it is hung up in the smoke to dry, %0aand not taken down till the end of four days, the sores %0awill gradually dry up with this portion of the root. Sophocles®^ %0aused to employ it both ways, boiled and raw, for the cure of %0agout; and he prescribes it, boiled in oil, for chilblains, and, %0ain vinegar, for jaundice and dropsy. It has been stated, %0aalso, that, used as a friction with wine and honey, or taken in %0adrink, it acts as an aphrodisiac. Xenocrates assures us, too, %0athat a decoction of the root in vinegar removes lichens, itch- %0ascabs, and leprous sores; and that a decoction of it, with hen¬ %0abane and tar, has a similar effect, and is good also for the re¬ %0amoval of bad odours®^ of the armpits and thighs; he states, %0aalso, that if the head is well rubbed with the root, being first %0ashaved, the hair will curl all the better for it. Simus pre¬ %0ascribes a decoction of it, in wine, to be taken for calculi in %0athe kidneys; and Hippocrates recommends the seed for ob¬ %0astructions of the spleen. The root, or else a decoction of it, %0aapplied topically, restores the hair in beasts of burden, where it %0ahas been lost by ulcerations or scab. It has the effect, too, of %0adriving away rats and mice, and of exterminating them, if %0aplaced before their holes. %0a%0aCHAP. 33.—THE HALIJION : FOTJJRTEEN KEMEDIES. %0a%0aSome authors have thought that it is the asphodel that is %0acalled “halimon” by Hesiod, an opinion which appears to me %0aill-founded; halimon®® being the name of a distinct plant. %0a%0aSee B. xvi. c. 11. %0a%0aOther readings are Diodes, Socles, and Socrates.

According to some, it is a tufted shrub, white, des¬ %0atitute of thorns, and with leaves like those of the olive, only %0asofter ; which eaten boiled, are an agreeable food. The root, %0athey say, taken in doses of one drachma in hydromel, allays %0agripings of the bowels, and is a cure for ruptures and convul¬ %0asions. Others, again, pronounce it to be a vegetable growing %0anear the sea-shore,®^ of a salt taste—to which, in fact, it %0aowes its name—with leaves somewhat round but elongated, %0aand much esteemed as an article of food. They say, too, that %0athere are two species of it, the wild and the cultivated,*® and %0athat, mixed with bread, they are good, both of them, for dy¬ %0asentery, even if ulceration should have supervened, and are %0auseful for stomachic affections, in combination with vinegar. %0aThe)’- state, also, that this plant is applied raw to ulcers of long %0astanding, and that it modifies the inflammation of recent %0awounds, and the pain attendant upon sprains of the feet and %0aaffections of the bladder. The wild halimon, they tell us, %0ahas thinner leaves- than the other, but is more effectual as a %0amedicament in all the above cases, as also for the cure of itch, %0awdiether in man or beast. The root, too, according to them, %0aemployed as a friction, renders the skin more clear, and the %0ateeth whiter; and they assert that if the seed of it is put %0abeneath the tongue, no thirst -nfill be experienced. They %0astate, also, that this kind is eaten as well as the other, and that %0athey are, both of them, preserved. %0a%0aCrateuas has spoken of a third®* kind also, with longer %0aleaves than the others, and more hairy : it has the smell of %0athe cypress, he says, and grows beneath the ivy more particu¬ %0alarly. He states that this plant is extremely good for %0aopisthotony and contractions of the sine^vs, taken in doses of %0athree oboli to one sextarius of water. %0a%0aHence its name, aXifiov, from n\g, the “sea,” and not, as Pliny says, %0afrom its salt taste. %0a%0a“ Mitius.” Fee says that if this word means “cultivated,” the %0aplant mentioned cannot be the Atriplex halimus; in which case he is %0ainclined to identify it with the Atriplex portulacoidcs of Linnaeus; the %0aleaves and young stalks of which, preserved in vinegar, have an agreeable %0ataste. %0a%0aSome other plant, probably.

The root, too, applied topically, with the %0aaddition of nitre, is a cure for fistula, but, when wanted for %0athis purpose, it must be dried first, so as to retain none of the %0ajuice; though, on the other hand, this juice does not at all %0aimpair its efficacy as an antidote to the poison of serpents. %0a%0aCHAP. 38. -THE SCANDIX : NINE REMKDIKS.

Boiled, it arrests* looseness of the bowels; and the %0aseed of it, .administered with vinegar, immediately stops %0ahiccup. It is employed topically for burns, and acts as a diure¬ %0atic; a decoction of it is good, too, for affections of the stomach, %0aliver, kidneys, and bladder. It is this plant that furnished %0aAristophanes with his joke* against the poet Euripides, that %0ahis mother used to sell not real vegetables, but only scandix. %0a%0aThe anthriscum^ would be exactly the same plant as the %0ascandix, if its leaves were somewhat thinner and more odor¬ %0aiferous.

The generative*® principle of %0athe mushroom is in the slime and the fermenting juices of the %0adamp earth, or of the roots of most of the glandiferous trees. %0aIt appears at first in the shape of a sort of viscous foam, and %0athen assumes a more substantial but membranous form, after %0awhich, as already stated, the young mushroom appears. %0a%0aIn general, these plants are of a pernicious nature, and the %0a%0a** “ Boleti.” She having been put to death by him. %0a%0a*’ “ Rimosa stria.” %0a%0a28 This description would apply to many of the fungi known as toad¬ %0astools at the present day. %0a%0a28* A true description, Fee says, of the agaric oronge, or the ksera* %0amushroom. %0a%0a29 The true origin of fungi has not been discovered till a compara¬ %0atively recent period, since the days of Linnaeus even.

Who, in fact, is able to distinguish them, except those %0awho dwell in the country, or the persons®* that are in the habit %0aof gathering them ? There are other circumstances, too, which %0arender them noxious ; if they grow near the hole of a serpent,®^ %0afor instance, or if they should happen to have been breathed %0aupon by one when just beginning to open ; being all the more %0adisposed to imbibe the venom from their natural affinity to %0apoisonous substances. %0a%0aIt will therefore be as well to be on our guard during the %0aseason at which the serpents have not as j-et retired to their %0aholes for the winter. The best sign to know this by is a mul¬ %0atitude of herbs, of trees, and of shrubs, which remain green %0afrom the time that these reptiles leave their holes till their re¬ %0aturn ; indeed, the ash alone will be quite sufficient for the %0apurpose, the leaves of it never coming out after the serpents %0ahave made their appearance, or beginning to fall before they %0ahave retired to their holes.

What %0agreat pleasure, then, can there be in partaking of a dish of so %0adoubtful “ a character as this ? Some persons have classified %0athese fungi according to the trees to which they are indebted %0afor their formation, the fig, for instance, the fennel-giant, and %0athe gummiferous trees ; those belonging to the beech, the robur, %0aand the cypress, not being edible, as already mentioned.** But %0awho is there to give us a guarantee when they come to market, %0athat these distinctions have been observed ? %0a%0aAll the poisonous fungi are of a livid colour; and the degree %0aof similarity borne by the sap of the tree itself to that of the %0afig will afibrd an additional indication whether they are venom¬ %0aous or not.

Decoctions of it are %0aused also for peripneumony and pleurisy, for wounds inflicted %0aby serpents, and for the poison of fungi.

Honey is used with rose-oil, as an injection %0afor the ears; it has the effect also of exterminating nits and %0afoul vermin of the head. It is the best plan always to skim %0ait before using it. %0a%0aStill, however, honey has a tendency to inflate®® the stomach ; %0ait increases the bilious secretions also, produces qualmishness, %0aand, according to some, if employed by itself, is injurious®® to %0athe sight: though, on the other hand, there are persons who %0arecommend ulcerations at the corners of the eyes to be touched %0a■with honey. %0a%0aAs to the elementary principles of honey, the different %0aTarieties of it, the countries where it is found, and its charac¬ %0ateristic features, we have enlarged upon them on previous %0aoccasions: first,®’ when treating of the nature of bees, and %0asecondly, when speaking®® of that of flowers; the plan of this %0awork compelling us to separate subjects which ought properly %0ato be united, if we would arrive at a thorough knowledge of %0athe operations of Nature. %0a%0a4 %0a%0aCHAP. 51 .- THE VABIOUS INFLUENCES OF HIFFEBENT ALIMENTS %0a%0aUPON THE DISPOSITION. %0a%0aI\Tiile speaking of the uses of honey, we ought also to treat %0aof the properties of hydromel.®® There are two kinds of hy- %0adromel, one of which is prepared at the moment, and taken %0awhile fresh,’® the other being kept to ripen.

I find it stated,’* too, by %0asome authors, that to relax the bowels it should be taken cold, %0aand that it is particularly well-suited for persons of a chilly %0atemperament, or of a weak and pusillanimous’* constitution, %0asuch as the Greeks, for instance, call “ micropsychi.^’ %0a%0aTor there is a theory,’** remarkable for its extreme ingenuity, %0afirst-established by Plato, according to which the primary atoms %0aof bodies, as they happen to be smooth or rough, angular or %0around, are more or less adapted to the various temperaments %0aof individuals : and hence it is, that the same substances are %0anot universally sweet or bitter to all. So, when affected witli %0alassitude or thirst, we are more prone to anger than at other %0atimes.’* These asperities, however, of the disposition, or rather %0aI should say of the mind,’® are capable of being modified by %0athe sweeter beverages ; as they tend to lubricate the passages %0afor the respiration, and to mollify the channels, the work of %0ainhalation and exhalation being thereby unimpeded by any %0arigidities. Every person must be sensible of this experiment¬ %0aally, in his own case: there is no one in whom anger, afflic¬ %0ation, sadness, and all the emotions of the mind may not, in %0asome degree, be modified by diet.

When %0amade with astringent wine, it does not clog the stomach, nor %0ahas it that effect when the honey has been boiled : in this last %0acase, too, it causes less flatulency, an inconvenience generally %0aincidental to this beverage. It acts as a stimulant also upon %0aa failing appetite; taken cold it relaxes the bowels, but used %0awarm it acts astringently, in most cases, at least. It has a %0atendency also to make flesh. Many persons have attained an %0aextreme old age, by taking bi'ead soaked in honiecl wine, and %0ano other diet—the fajnous instance of Pollio Eomilius, for ex¬ %0aample.

Applied topically, they allay all %0akinds of abscesses, when ulcerated and chapped more parti¬ %0acularly ; with melilote or quinces they are applied to defluxions %0aof the eyes, and with polenta they are employed topically for %0asuppuration^. A decoction of them is Aised for ulcerations of %0athe mouth and genitals, and, with rose-oil or quinces, for %0adiseases of the fundament. For affections which demand a %0amore active remedy, they are used Avith pomegranate rind, %0aand the addition of a little honey ; to prevent the composition %0afrom drying too quickly, beet leaves are added. They are ap¬ %0aplied topically, also, to scrofulous sores, and to tumours, Avhether %0aripe or only coming to a head, being thoroughly boiled first %0ain vinegar. Mixed with hydromel they are employed for the %0acure of chaps, and with pomegranate rind for gangrenes. %0aWith polenta they are used for gout, for diseases of the %0auterus and kidneys, for chilblains, and for ulcerations which %0a%0a” Most of the properties here ascribed to the lentil.

Lentils are bad for the %0alungs, head-ache, all nervous affections, and bile, and are very %0aapt to cause restlessness at night. They are useful, however, %0afor pustules, erysipelas, and affections of the mamillae, boiled %0ain sea-water; and, ajjplied with vinegar, they disperse indura¬ %0ations and scrofulous sores. As a stomachic, they arc mixed, %0alike polenta, with the drink given to patients. Parboiled in %0awater, and then pounded and bolted through a sieve to disen¬ %0agage the bran, they are good for burns, care being taken to %0aadd a little honey as the}' heal: they are boiled, also, with %0aoxycrate for diseases of the throat.'’® %0a%0aThere is a marsh-lentil’® also, which grows spontaneously %0ain stagnant waters.

It is taken in drink with wormwood for %0adysentery : employed with wine it accelerates the catamenia %0aAvhen retarded, a decoction of it having the effect of arresting %0athem when in excess: the plant, applied by itself, stanclies %0athe blood of Avounds. It is a cure, too, for tlie stings of ser¬ %0apents, and a decoction of it in wine allays prurigo of the %0atestes. %0a%0aOur herbalists of the present day take for the “ elelisphacos” %0aof the Greeks the “salvia”*' of the Latins, a plant similar in %0aappearance to mint, Avhite and aromatic.

Taken in con¬ %0asiderable quantities, it relaxes the bowels, and produces griping %0apains and flatulency ; parched, however, it is looked upon as %0amore wholesome. The chicheling vetch,“again, acts more bene¬ %0aficially upon the bowels. The meal of both kinds heals running %0asores of the head—that of the wild sort being the more effica¬ %0acious of the two—as also epilepsy, swellings of the liver, and %0astings inflicted by serpents. It acts as an emmenagogue and %0aa diuretic, used in the grain more particularly, and it is a cure %0afor lichens, inflammations of the testes, jaundice, and dropsy. %0aAll these kinds, however, exercise an injurious effect upon %0aulcerations of the bladder and kidneys: but in combination %0awith honey they are very good for gangrenous sores, and the %0acancer knowu'as “ cacoethes.” The following is a method %0a%0aSprengel thinks that he is speaking here of the Salvia triloba of %0aLinnaeus. %0a%0aThe Trygon pastinaca of Linnaeus. %0a%0a*' “ Sage,” the plant, no doubt, that he has been describing. %0a%0a*- See B. xviii. c. 32.

If a %0aperson eats of it, fasting, every day, according to authors of %0athe very highest authority, the spleen will gradually diminish. %0aThe meal of it removes spots on the face and other parts of the %0abody. It prevents ulcers from spreading also, and is extremely %0aefficacious for affections of the mamillae : mixed with wine, it %0amakes carbuncles break. Parched, and taken with a piece of %0ahoney the size of a hazel nut, it cures dysuria, flatulency, %0aaffections of the liver, tenesmus, and that state of the body in %0awhich no nourishment is derived from the food, generall)' known %0aas “ atrophy.” For cutaneous eruptions, plasters are made of %0aIt boiled with honejq being left to remain four days on the part %0aaflected.

Of all the %0aalimentary substances, there are none M’hich are less heavy or %0amore useful®® than dried lupines. Their bitterness is consider¬ %0aably m'odified by cooking them on hot ashes, or stei'ping them %0ain hot water. Employed frequently as an article of food, they %0aimpart freshness to the colour; the bitter lupine, too, is good for %0athe sting of the asp. Dried lupines, stripped of the husk and %0apounded, are applied in a linen cloth to black ulcers, in which %0athey make new flesh: boiled in vinegar, they disperse scrofu¬ %0alous sores and imposthumes of the parotid glands. A decoc¬ %0ation of them, with rue and pepper, is given in fever even, as %0aan expellent of intestinal worms,®® to patients under thirty %0ayears of age. For children, also, they are applied to the sto¬ %0amach as a vermifuge, the patient fasting in the meantime ; and, %0aaccording to another mode of treatment, they are parched and %0ataken in boiled must or in honey. %0a%0aLupines have the effect of stimulating the appetite, and of %0adispelling nausea. The meal of them, kneaded up with vine¬ %0agar, and applied in the bath, removes pimples and prurigo ; %0aemployed alone, it dries up ulcerous sores. It cures bruises %0aalso, and, used with polenta, allays inflammations. The wild %0alupine is found to be the most efficacious for debility of the %0a%0aFee say.s that this is the case, and that the use of it is said to produce %0aa marked debility. %0a%0aSee B. xviii. c. 10. %0a%0aFee remarks that it is surprising to find the ancients setting so much %0avalue on the lupine, a plant that is bitter and almost nauseous, difficult to %0aboil, and bad of digestion. %0a%0aIt must be the rue.

A dfcoction of them, used as a fomenta¬ %0ation, removes freckles and improves the skin; and lupines, %0aeither wild or-cultivated, boiled down to the consistency of %0ahoney, are a cure for black eruptions and leprosy. An appli¬ %0acation of cultivated lupines causes carbuncles to break, and re¬ %0aduces inflamed tumours and scrofulous sores, or else brings them %0ato a head: boiled in vinegar, they restore the flesh when cica¬ %0atrized to its proper colour. Thoroughly boiled in rain-water, %0athe decoction of them furnishes a detersive medicine, of which %0afomentations are made for gangrenes, purulent eruptions, and %0arunning ulcers. This decoction is very good, taken in drink, %0aforattections of the spleen, and with honey, for retardations of %0athe catamenia. Beaten up raw, with dried figs, lupines are %0aapplied exteruallj’^ to the spleen. A decoction of the root acts %0aas a diuretic. %0a%0aThe herb chamaeleon,®^ also, is boiled with lupines, and the %0awater of it strained off", to be used as a potion for cattle. %0aLupines boiled in am urea,®- or a decoction of them mixed with %0aamurca, heals the itch in beasts.

And yet, how much is there %0a%3c still left for us to describe, and how many discoveries of a still %0a%3c more astonishing nature ! The greater part, in fact, of the %0a%3c plants there mentioned recommend themselves to us by their %0a%3c taste, their fragrance, or their beauty, and so invite us to %0a%3c make repeated trials of their virtues: but, on the other hand, %0a%3c the properties of those which remain to be de.scribed, furnish %0a%3c us with abundant proof that nothing has been created by Nature %0a%3c without some purpose to fulfil, unrevealed to us though it %0a%3c may be. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 2. (1.) -PLANTS USED BY NATIONS FOR THE ADORNMENT OF %0a%3c %0a%3c THE PERSON. %0a%3c %0a%3c 1 remark, in the first place, that there are some foreign na¬ %0a%3c tions which, in obedience to long-established usage, employ %0a%3c certain plants for the embellishment pf'the person. That, %0a%3c among some barbarous peoples, the females^ stain the face by %0a%3c means of various plants, there can be little doubt, and among %0a%3c tlie Daci and the Sarmatse we find the men even marking^ their %0a%3c bodies. There is a plant in Gaul, similar to the plantago in %0a%3c appearance, and known there by the name of “ glastum %0a%3c %0a%3c * Fee remarks, that at the present day, in all savage nations in which %0a%3c tatooing is practised, the men display more taste and care in the operation %0a%3c than is shewn by the females. There is little doubt that it is the art of %0a%3c tatooing the body, or in other words, first puncturing it and then rubbing %0a%3c in various colours, that is here spoken of by Pliny. %0a%3c %0a%3c 2 “ Inscribiint.” “Writing upon,” or “tatooing," evidently. %0a%3c %0a%3c 3 Our “ woad,” the Isatis tinctoria of Linnmus, which imparts a blue %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 390 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c PLIirr’s NATURAL HISTORY. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XXII. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c with it both matrons and girls^ among the people of Britain %0a%3c are in the habit of staining the body all over, when taking %0a%3c part in the performance of certain sacred rites; rivalling %0a%3c hereby the swarthy hue of the ^Ethiopians, they go in a state %0a%3c of nature. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 3.

EXPLANA¬ %0a%3c TION OF THE TEEMS SAGMEN, VEKBENA, AND CLARIGATIO. %0a%3c %0a%3c We know, too, that from plants are extracted admirable %0a%3c colours for dyeing; and, not to mention the berries® of Galatia,® %0a%3c Africa, and Lusitania, which furnish the coccus, a dye re¬ %0a%3c served for the military costume’' of our generals, the people of %0a%3c Gaul beyond the Alps produce the Tyrian colours, the conchy- %0a%3c liated,® and all the other hues, by the agency of plants® alone. %0a%3c They have not there to seek the murex at the bottom of the %0a%3c sea, or to expose themselves to be the prey of the monsters of %0a%3c the deep, while tearing it from their jaws, nor have they to go %0a%3c searching in depths to which no anchor has penetrated—and %0a%3c all this for the purpose of finding the means whereby some %0a%3c mother of a family may appear more charming in the eyes of %0a%3c her paramour, or the seducer may make himself more captivat¬ %0a%3c ing to the wife of another man. Standing on dry land, the %0a%3c people there gather in their dyes just as we do our crops of %0a%3c %0a%3c colour. The root of this Celtic wood is probably “ glas,” “blue,” whence %0a%3c also our word “glass and it is not improbable that the name of glass %0a%3c was given to it from the blue tints which it presented. Julius Caesar and %0a%3c Pomponius Mela translate this word “ glastum,” by the Latin “ vitrum,” %0a%3c “glass.” %0a%3c %0a%3c “Conjuges nurusque.” Caesar says that the people in Britain were %0a%3c in the habit of staining the body with woad, to add to the horror of their %0a%3c appearance in battle. Pomponius Mela expresses himself as uncertain for %0a%3c what purpose it was done, whether it was to add to their beauty, or for %0a%3c some other reasons to him unknown. %0a%3c %0a%3c ® “ Granis.” What the ancients took to be a vegetable substance, is %0a%3c now known to be an insect, the kermes of the Quercus coccifera. %0a%3c %0a%3c * See B. ix. c. 63. %0a%3c %0a%3c ’ “ Paludamentis.” The “ paludamentum” was the cloak worn by a %0a%3c Roman general when in command, his principal officers, and personal at¬ %0a%3c tendants. It was open in front, reached to the knees or thereabout, and %0a%3c hung over the shoulders, being fastened across the chest by a clasp. It %0a%3c was commonly white or purple. %0a%3c %0a%3c ® For an account of all these colours see B. ix. cc. 60—65. %0a%3c %0a%3c ® The vaccinium for instance.

Still, however, I should not have %0a%3c omitted to enlarge upon the art of dyeing, had I found that it %0a%3c had ever been looked upon as forming one of our liberal'® arts. %0a%3c Meantime, I shall be actuated by higher considerations, and %0a%3c shall proceed to show in what esteem we are bound to hold %0a%3c the mute'® plants even, or in other words, the plants of little %0a%3c note. For, indeed, the authors and founders of the Roman %0a%3c sway have derived from these very plants even almost bound¬ %0a%3c less results; as it was these same plants, and no others, that %0a%3c afforded them the “ sagmen,”'^ employed in seasons of public %0a%3c calamity, and the “ verbena” of our sacred rites and embassies. %0a%3c These two names, no doubt, originally signified the same thing, %0a%3c —a green turf torn up from the citadel with the earth attached %0a%3c to it; and hence, when envoys were dispatched to the enemy %0a%3c for the purpose of clarigation, or, in other words, with the %0a%3c object of clearlif^ demanding restitution of property that had %0a%3c been carried off, one of these officers was always known as %0a%3c the “ verbenarius.”'® %0a%3c %0a%3c Fee thinks that the art of dyeing with alkanet and madder may he %0a%3c here alluded to. " See B. xxxv. c. 1. %0a%3c %0a%3c The “good,” “ingenuous,” or “liberal” arts were those which might %0a%3c be practised by free men without loss of dignity. Pliny is somewhat in¬ %0a%3c consistent here, for he makes no scruple at enlarging upon the art of me¬ %0a%3c dicine, which among the Romans was properly not a liberal, but a servile, %0a%3c art. %0a%3c %0a%3c “Sardis.” %0a%3c %0a%3c Festus says the “ verbenae,” or pure herbs, were called “sagmina,” %0a%3c because they were taken from a sacred (sacer) place. It is more generally %0a%3c supposed that “ sagmen” comes from “ sancio,” to render inviolable,” %0a%3c tile person of the bearer being looked upon as inviolable. %0a%3c %0a%3c ts “ Clare.” %0a%3c %0a%3c 18 Or bearer of the “ verbena.” See further on this subject in B. xxv. %0a%3c c. 69. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 392 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c flint’s natural history. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XXI I. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 4.

The crowns'® bedecked with %0a%3c gems of gold, the vallar, mural, rostrate, civic, and triumphal %0a%3c crowns, were, all of them, inferior to this; great, indeed, was %0a%3c the difference between them, and far in the background were %0a%3c they thrown by it. As to all the rest, a single individual %0a%3c could confer them, a general or commander on his soldiers for %0a%3c instance, or, as on some occasions, on his colleague : the senate, %0a%3c too, exempt from the cares and anxieties of war, and the people %0a%3c in the enjoyment of repose, could award them, together with %0a%3c the honours of a triumph. %0a%3c %0a%3c (4.) But as for the crown of grass, it was never conferred %0a%3c except at a crisis of extreme desperation, never voted except %0a%3c by the acclamation of the whole array, and never to any one %0a%3c but to him who had been its preserver. Other crowns were %0a%3c awarded by the generals to the soldiers, this alone by the %0a%3c soldiers, and to the general. This crown is known also as the %0a%3c “ obsidional” crown, from the circumstance of a beleaguered %0a%3c army being delivered, and so preserved from fearful disaster. %0a%3c If we are to regard* as a glorious and a hallowed reward the %0a%3c civic crown, presented for preserving the life of a single citizen, %0a%3c and him, perhaps, of the very humblest rank, what, pray, ought %0a%3c to be thought of a whole army being saved, and indebted for its %0a%3c preservation to the valour of a single individual ? %0a%3c %0a%3c The crown thus presented was made of green grass,'® %0a%3c gathered on the spot where the troops so rescued had been %0a%3c beleaguered. Indeed, in early times, it wms the usual token of %0a%3c victory for the vanquished to present to the conqueror a handful %0a%3c of grass ; signifying thereby that they surrendered®® their na¬ %0a%3c tive soil, the land that had nurtured them, and the very right %0a%3c even there to be interred—a usage which, to my own know¬ %0a%3c ledge, still exists among the nations of Germany.®' %0a%3c %0a%3c “ Corona graminea.” %0a%3c %0a%3c '® For a description of these various crowns, see B. xvi. c. 3. %0a%3c %0a%3c Sometimes also, weeds, or wild flowers. %0a%3c %0a%3c See Servius on the Alneid, B. viii. 1. 128. %0a%3c %0a%3c No doubt, the old English custom of delivering seisin by presenting %0a%3c a turf, originated in this. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Clap. 5.] PERSONS PRESENTED WITH THE GRASS CROWN. 393 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 5.

He testified by an %0a%3c act of devoutness in what high esteem he held such an honour %0a%3c as this, for, adorned with these insignia, he sacrificed a white %0a%3c ox to Mars, together with one hundred red oxen, which had %0a%3c been presented to him by the beleaguered troops as the recom¬ %0a%3c pense of his valour : it was this same Decius, who afterwards, %0a%3c when consul, with Imperiosus^® for his colleague, devoted his %0a%3c hfe to secure victory to his fellow-citizens. %0a%3c %0a%3c This crown was presented also by the senate and people of %0a%3c Rome—a distinction than which I know of nothing in exist¬ %0a%3c ence more glorious—to that same Fabius*® who restored the %0a%3c fortunes of Rome by avoiding a battle; not, however, on the %0a%3c occasion when he preserved the master of the horse*^ and his %0a%3c army ; for then it was deemed preferable by those who were %0a%3c indebted to him for their preservation to present him with a %0a%3c crown under a new title, that of “ father.” The crown of %0a%3c grass was, however, awarded to him, with that unanimity %0a%3c which I have mentioned, after Hannibal had been expelled %0a%3c from Ital}^; being the only crown, in fact, that has hitherto %0a%3c been placed upon the head of a citizen by the hands of the %0a%3c state itself, and, another remarkable distinction, the only one %0a%3c that has ever been conferred by the whole of Italy united. %0a%3c %0a%3c “ See B. vii. c. 29.

Calpurnius Flarama,^ %0a%3c then a military tribune in Sicily ; but up to the present time %0a%3c it has been given to a single centurion only, Cneius Petreius %0a%3c Atinas, during the war with the Cimbri. This soldier, while %0a%3c acting as primipilus*® under Catulus, on finding all retreat for %0a%3c Ids legion cut off by the enemy, harangued the troops, and %0a%3c after slaying his tribune who hesitated to cut a way through the %0a%3c encampment of the enemy, brought away the legion in safety. %0a%3c I find it stated also by some authors, that, in addition to this %0a%3c honour, this same Petreius, clad in the praetexta, offered sacri¬ %0a%3c fice at the altar, to the sound of the pipe,®® in presence of the %0a%3c then consuls,®* Marius and Catulus. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Dictator S 5 dla has also stated in his memoirs, that when %0a%3c legatus in the Marsic War he wms presented with this crown %0a%3c by the army, atNola; an event which he caused to be com¬ %0a%3c memorated in a painting at his Tusculan villa, which after¬ %0a%3c wards became the property of Cicero. If there is any truth %0a%3c in this statement, I can only say that it renders his memory %0a%3c all the more execrable, and that, by his proscriptions, with his %0a%3c own hand he tore this crown from his brow, for few indeed %0a%3c were the citizens whom he thus preserved, in comparison with %0a%3c those he slaughtered at a later period. And let him even add %0a%3c to this high honour his proud surname of “ Felix,”®® if he will; %0a%3c all the glories of this crown he eurrendered to Sertorius, from %0a%3c the moment that he put his proscribed fellow-citizens in a %0a%3c stage of siege throughout the whole world. %0a%3c %0a%3c Varro, too, relates that Scipio ^milianus was awarded the %0a%3c obsidional crown in Africa, under the consul Manilius,®® for the %0a%3c preservation of three cohorts, by bringing as many to their %0a%3c rescue; an event commemorated by an inscription upon the %0a%3c base of the statue erected in honour of him by the now deified %0a%3c Emperor Augustus, in the Forum which bears his name.

All this, however, is but little known %0a%3c among us at the present day; a fact which I am the less sur¬ %0a%3c prised at, when I reflect that those plants even are treated %0a%3c with the same indifference, the purpose of which it is to pre¬ %0a%3c serve our health, to allay our bodily pains, and to repel the %0a%3c advances of death ! And who is there that would not visit %0a%3c with censure, and justly visit, the manners of the present day ? %0a%3c Luxury and effeminacy have augmented the price at which %0a%3c we live, and never was life more hankered after, or worse %0a%3c cared®’ for, than it is at present. This, however, w'e look upon %0a%3c as the business of others, forsooth ; other persons must see to it, %0a%3c ■VN’ithout our troubling ourselves to request them, and the ph)'- %0a%3c sicians must exercise the necessary providence in our behalves. ® %0a%3c As for ourselves, we go on enjoying our pleasures, and are con¬ %0a%3c tent to live—a thing that in my opinion reflects the highest %0a%3c possible disgrace—by putting faith in others.®® %0a%3c %0a%3c Nay, even more than this, we ourselves are held in derision %0a%3c by many, for undertaking these researches, and are chaiged %0a%3c ■v\dth busying ourselves with mere frivolities!

Here, how¬ %0a%3c ever, she has devised another class of plants, bristling and re¬ %0a%3c pulsive to the sight, and dangerous to the touch; so much so, %0a%3c indeed, that we fancy we all but hear the voice of her who %0a%3c made them as she I’eveals to us her motives for so doing. It is %0a%3c her wish, she says, that no ravening cattle may browse upon %0a%3c them, that no wanton hand may tear them up, that no heed¬ %0a%3c less footstep may tread them down, that no bird, perching there, %0a%3c may break them : and in thus fortifying them with thorns, and %0a%3c ^ arming them with weapons, it has been her grand object %0a%3c to save and protect the remedies which they afford to man. %0a%3c Thus we see, the very qualities even which we hold in such %0a%3c aversion, have been devised by Nature for the benefit and ad¬ %0a%3c vantage of mankind. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 8.

But the more general opinion is %0a%3c that it is the eringo, or Eryngium campestre of Linnaeus. It derives its %0a%3c name from the Greek spfvytiv, from its asserted property of dispelling %0a%3c flatulent eructations. It is possessed in reality of few medicinal proper¬ %0a%3c ties, and is only used occasionally, at the present day, as a diuretic.

There are some %0a%3c marvellous facts related in connexion -with this plant; the root®’ %0a%3c %0a%3c See B. xxvii. c. 2. %0a%3c %0a%3c By the Avord “toxica,” Poinsinet would understand, not poisons in %0a%3c general, but the venom of the toad, which was called, he says, in the %0a%3c Celtic and Celto-Scythic languages, toussac and tossa. Fee ridicules the %0a%3c notion. %0a%3c %0a%3c Or rather. Fee says, deep blue. He identifies this with the Eryngium %0a%3c cyaneum of Linnaeus, the eringo, with a blue flower. %0a%3c %0a%3c This, as well as the next, is identical, probably, Avith the Eryngium %0a%3c maritimum of Linnaeus; our sea-holly. Tlie species found in Greece, in %0a%3c addition to the above; are the Eryngium tricuspidatum, multifidum, and %0a%3c parviflorum. %0a%3c %0a%3c Pliny probably makes a mistake here, and reads afXivov, “ parsley,” %0a%3c for (TKoXvfiog, a “ thistle.” Dalecbamps is of this opinion, from an ex¬ %0a%3c amination of the leaf; and Brotier adopts it. %0a%3c %0a%3c Or “ hundred heads,” the ordinary Eryngium campestre of Linnaeus, %0a%3c It is still called panicaut a cent tetes, by the French. %0a%3c %0a%3c ‘o It is no longer used for this purpose ; but Fee is of opinion that it %0a%3c owes its French name of “ panicaut,” from having been used in former %0a%3c times as a substitute for bread—juam. %0a%3c %0a%3c ** It is not improbable that this plant is the same as the mandrake of %0a%3c Genesis, c. xxx. 14 ; which is said to have borne some resemblance to the %0a%3c human figure, and is spoken of by the commentators as male and female. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 393 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c PLINY's NATCJEAL niSTOEY. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XXII. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c of it, it is said, bears a strong resemblance to the organs of %0a%3c either sex ; it is but rarely found, but if a root resembling the %0a%3c male organs should happen to fall in the way of a man, it %0a%3c will ensure him woman’s love; hence it is that Phaon the %0a%3c Lesbian was so passionately beloved®^ by Sappho. Upon this %0a%3c subject, too, there have been numerous other revex’ies, not only %0a%3c on the part of the Magi, but of Pythagorean philosophers even %0a%3c as well. %0a%3c %0a%3c So far as its medicinal properties are concerned, in addition %0a%3c to those already mentioned, this plant, taken in hydroineJ, is %0a%3c good for flatulency, gripings of the bowels, diseases of the %0a%3c heart, stomach, liver, and thoracic organs, and, taken in o.vy- %0a%3c crate, for affections of the spleen. Mixed with hydromel, it is %0a%3c recommended also for diseases of the kidneys, strangury, opistho- %0a%3c tony, spasms, lumbago, dropsy, epilepsy, suppression or excess of %0a%3c the catamenia, and all maladies of the uterus. Applied with %0a%3c honey, it extracts foreign substances from the body, and, with %0a%3c salted axle-grease and cerate, it disperses scrofulous sores, im- %0a%3c posthumes of the pai’otid glands, inflamed tumours, denudations %0a%3c of the bones, and fractures. Taken before drinking, it pre¬ %0a%3c vents the fumes of wine from rising to the head, and it arrests %0a%3c looseness of the bowels. Some of our authors have recom¬ %0a%3c mended that this plant should be gathered at the period of %0a%3c the summer solstice, and that it should be applied, in combi¬ %0a%3c nation with rain water, for all kinds of maladies of the neck. %0a%3c They say too, that, attached as an amulet to the person, it is a %0a%3c cure for albugo.®^ %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 10.

The %0a%3c asphodel is prescribed also for w^ounds inflicted by marine %0a%3c animals of a venomous nature, and the bite of the land scolo- %0a%3c pendra.

The leaves, too, are applied with wine to wounds %0a%3c made by venomous animals, and the bulbs are beaten up with %0a%3c polenta and similarly used for affections of the sinews and %0a%3c joints. It is also a very good plan to rub lichens with them %0a%3c chopped up and mixed with vinegar, and to apply them in %0a%3c w'ater to putrid sores, as also to inflammations of the testes or %0a%3c mamillse.

Some persons say that if, after applying the %0a%3c root to the sores, a part of it is hung up in the smoke to dry, %0a%3c and not taken down till the end of four days, the sores %0a%3c will gradually dry up with this portion of the root. Sophocles®^ %0a%3c used to employ it both ways, boiled and raw, for the cure of %0a%3c gout; and he prescribes it, boiled in oil, for chilblains, and, %0a%3c in vinegar, for jaundice and dropsy. It has been stated, %0a%3c also, that, used as a friction with wine and honey, or taken in %0a%3c drink, it acts as an aphrodisiac. Xenocrates assures us, too, %0a%3c that a decoction of the root in vinegar removes lichens, itch- %0a%3c scabs, and leprous sores; and that a decoction of it, with hen¬ %0a%3c bane and tar, has a similar effect, and is good also for the re¬ %0a%3c moval of bad odours®^ of the armpits and thighs; he states, %0a%3c also, that if the head is well rubbed with the root, being first %0a%3c shaved, the hair will curl all the better for it. Simus pre¬ %0a%3c scribes a decoction of it, in wine, to be taken for calculi in %0a%3c the kidneys; and Hippocrates recommends the seed for ob¬ %0a%3c structions of the spleen. The root, or else a decoction of it, %0a%3c applied topically, restores the hair in beasts of burden, where it %0a%3c has been lost by ulcerations or scab.

It is applied topically, also, to carbuncles, with rue %0a%3c or honey, or else by itself, with some viscous substance to %0a%3c make it adhere; for the bites of dogs, also, it is similarly em¬ %0a%3c ployed. A decoction of it in vinegar, with pomegranate rind, %0a%3c is used for excrescences ^ of the fundament, and, mixed with %0a%3c nitre, for the corns commonly known as “ morticini.”®^ In %0a%3c cases of alopecy which have been first treated with nitre, it %0a%3c makes the hair grow again, applied witli wine and saffron, or %0a%3c else pepper or mouse-dung and vinegar.

For corns on the feet, %0a%3c if pared first, it is particularly useful, as also as a preservative %0a%3c against the effects of bad water, and of unhealthy climates or %0a%3c weather. It is prescribed for cough, too, affections of the %0a%3c uvula, jaundice of long standing, dropsy, and hoarseness, having %0a%3c the effect of instantly clearing the throat and restoring the %0a%3c voice.

Decoctions of it are %0a%3c used also for peripneumony and pleurisy, for wounds inflicted %0a%3c by serpents, and for the poison of fungi. For paralysis, it is %0a%3c prescribed in honied wine, though that liquor also has its own %0a%3c peculiar virtues. Honey is used with rose-oil, as an injection %0a%3c for the ears; it has the effect also of exterminating nits and %0a%3c foul vermin of the head. It is the best plan always to skim %0a%3c it before using it. %0a%3c %0a%3c Still, however, honey has a tendency to inflate®® the stomach ; %0a%3c it increases the bilious secretions also, produces qualmishness, %0a%3c and, according to some, if employed by itself, is injurious®® to %0a%3c the sight: though, on the other hand, there are persons who %0a%3c recommend ulcerations at the corners of the eyes to be touched %0a%3c ■with honey. %0a%3c %0a%3c As to the elementary principles of honey, the different %0a%3c Tarieties of it, the countries where it is found, and its charac¬ %0a%3c teristic features, we have enlarged upon them on previous %0a%3c occasions: first,®’ when treating of the nature of bees, and %0a%3c secondly, when speaking®® of that of flowers; the plan of this %0a%3c work compelling us to separate subjects which ought properly %0a%3c to be united, if we would arrive at a thorough knowledge of %0a%3c the operations of Nature. %0a%3c %0a%3c 4 %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 51 .- THE VABIOUS INFLUENCES OF HIFFEBENT ALIMENTS %0a%3c %0a%3c UPON THE DISPOSITION. %0a%3c %0a%3c I\Tiile speaking of the uses of honey, we ought also to treat %0a%3c of the properties of hydromel.®® There are two kinds of hy- %0a%3c dromel, one of which is prepared at the moment, and taken %0a%3c while fresh,’® the other being kept to ripen. The first, %0a%3c %0a%3c « It is of an emollient nature, and is preferred to sugar for sweetening %0a%3c liquids, in a multitude of instances. . -i.- . i %0a%3c %0a%3c Fee denies this ; but there is no doubt that honey has this tendency %0a%3c with some persons. %0a%3c %0a%3c Fee says that this is not the case. %0a%3c %0a%3c 67 In B xi c 13. ®® In II- %0a%3c %0a%3c “ Aqua i^ulsa.” See B. xiv. c. 20, where it is described as Hydro- %0a%3c %0a%3c meli, or Melicraton. i . .t, ^ -i %0a%3c %0a%3c Fee says that this must have been a wholesome beverage, but that it %0a%3c %0a%3c F F 2 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 436 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Pliny's natural history. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XXII. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c which is made of skimmed hqney, is an extremely whole¬ %0a%3c some beverage for invalids w^ho take nothing but a light diet, %0a%3c such as strained alica for instance : it reinvigorates the body, %0a%3c is soothing to the mouth and stomach, and by its refreshing %0a%3c properties allays feverish heats. I find it stated,’* too, by %0a%3c some authors, that to relax the bowels it should be taken cold, %0a%3c and that it is particularly well-suited for persons of a chilly %0a%3c temperament, or of a weak and pusillanimous’* constitution, %0a%3c such as the Greeks, for instance, call “ micropsychi.^’ %0a%3c %0a%3c Tor there is a theory,’** remarkable for its extreme ingenuity, %0a%3c first-established by Plato, according to which the primary atoms %0a%3c of bodies, as they happen to be smooth or rough, angular or %0a%3c round, are more or less adapted to the various temperaments %0a%3c of individuals : and hence it is, that the same substances are %0a%3c not universally sweet or bitter to all. So, when affected witli %0a%3c lassitude or thirst, we are more prone to anger than at other %0a%3c times.’* These asperities, however, of the disposition, or rather %0a%3c I should say of the mind,’® are capable of being modified by %0a%3c the sweeter beverages ; as they tend to lubricate the passages %0a%3c for the respiration, and to mollify the channels, the work of %0a%3c inhalation and exhalation being thereby unimpeded by any %0a%3c rigidities. Every person must be sensible of this experiment¬ %0a%3c ally, in his own case: there is no one in whom anger, afflic¬ %0a%3c tion, sadness, and all the emotions of the mind may not, in %0a%3c some degree, be modified by diet. It will therefore be worth %0a%3c our while to observe what aliments they' are which exercise a %0a%3c physical effect, not only upon the body, but the disposition %0a%3c as well. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 52.-HYDROMEL : EIGHTEEN REMEDIES. %0a%3c %0a%3c Ilydromel is recommended, too, as very good for a cough : %0a%3c %0a%3c would cease to be so f»fter undergoing fermentation. In the description %0a%3c of its uses there are some errors, Fee says, combined with some rational %0a%3c observations. %0a%3c %0a%3c ■'* See B. xviii. c. 29; also c. 61 of this Book. %0a%3c %0a%3c This seems to be the meaning of “prseparci” here, though it gene¬ %0a%3c rally signifies “ niggardly,” or “ sordid.” %0a%3c %0a%3c Fee combats this theory at considerable length ; but there caa be %0a%3c little doubt that the same substance has not the same taste to all indi¬ %0a%3c viduals. %0a%3c %0a%3c Seneca makes a similar observation, De Irh, B. iii. c. 10. %0a%3c %0a%3c “ Animi sen potius anima;.” %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 53.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c HONIED WINE. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 437 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c taken warm, it promotes vomiting.

It is used as an injection for dis¬ %0a%3c eases of the ears, and in cases of fistula of the generative %0a%3c organs. With crumb of bread it is applied as a poultice to %0a%3c tlie uterus, as also to tumours suddenly formed, sprains, and %0a%3c all affections which require soothing applications. The more %0a%3c recent writers have condemned the use of fermented hydro- %0a%3c mel, as being not so harmless as water, and less strengthening %0a%3c than wine. After it has been kept a considerable time, it %0a%3c becomes transformed into a wine,’® which, it is universally %0a%3c agreed, is extremely prejudicial to the stomach, and injurious %0a%3c to the nerves.’® %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 53 . -HONIED WINE *. SIX KEMEDIES. %0a%3c %0a%3c As to honied*® wine, that is always the best which has been %0a%3c made with old wine : honey, too, incorporates with it very %0a%3c readily, which is never the case with sweet®^ wine. When %0a%3c made with astringent wine, it does not clog the stomach, nor %0a%3c has it that effect when the honey has been boiled : in this last %0a%3c case, too, it causes less flatulency, an inconvenience generally %0a%3c incidental to this beverage. It acts as a stimulant also upon %0a%3c a failing appetite; taken cold it relaxes the bowels, but used %0a%3c warm it acts astringently, in most cases, at least. It has a %0a%3c tendency also to make flesh. Many persons have attained an %0a%3c extreme old age, by taking bi'ead soaked in honiecl wine, and %0a%3c no other diet—the fajnous instance of Pollio Eomilius, for ex¬ %0a%3c ample.

Their bitterness is consider¬ %0a%3c ably m'odified by cooking them on hot ashes, or stei'ping them %0a%3c in hot water.

Dried lupines, stripped of the husk and %0a%3c pounded, are applied in a linen cloth to black ulcers, in which %0a%3c they make new flesh: boiled in vinegar, they disperse scrofu¬ %0a%3c lous sores and imposthumes of the parotid glands. A decoc¬ %0a%3c tion of them, with rue and pepper, is given in fever even, as %0a%3c an expellent of intestinal worms,®® to patients under thirty %0a%3c years of age. For children, also, they are applied to the sto¬ %0a%3c mach as a vermifuge, the patient fasting in the meantime ; and, %0a%3c according to another mode of treatment, they are parched and %0a%3c taken in boiled must or in honey. %0a%3c %0a%3c Lupines have the effect of stimulating the appetite, and of %0a%3c dispelling nausea. The meal of them, kneaded up with vine¬ %0a%3c gar, and applied in the bath, removes pimples and prurigo ; %0a%3c employed alone, it dries up ulcerous sores.

An appli¬ %0a%3c cation of cultivated lupines causes carbuncles to break, and re¬ %0a%3c duces inflamed tumours and scrofulous sores, or else brings them %0a%3c to a head: boiled in vinegar, they restore the flesh when cica¬ %0a%3c trized to its proper colour.
