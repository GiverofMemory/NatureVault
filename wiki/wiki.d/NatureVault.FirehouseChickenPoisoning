csum=May have been undercooked chicken or just contaminated cheese or coleslaw.  Took a nap after eating and felt strong [[chronic fatigue]] and [[delerium]] and [[myositis]] after awakening.  Likely from [[brucella]]. So took 2 capsules of [[cinnamon]] which helped those symptoms quite a bit.  Then an hour later got [[chronic cough]] [[brain fog]] and [[headache]] and [[eyes]] bloodshot and soreness.  All of these lasted hours so took some [[harmony]] before bed.  Harmony caused some [[heart skipping beats]] so was probqbly killing the [[h pylori]] that cuased the headache and coughing.  Awoke from a zombie dream with a touch of [[neuropathy]] (tinge of burning sensation in random spots on extremeties) and touch of pain in the [[spleen]].  Spleen pain is known in [[brucella]] disease.  Also had slightly weak grip which is characteristic of brucella.
