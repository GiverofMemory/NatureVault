text=The Third Commandment %0a%0a%0a%0a204. The third M.itzva is to know that there is an Almighty Lord who governs %0athe world, to unite this every day in the six Supernal limbs: HQT NHY of %0aZeir Anpin, and to unify them in the six words of the prayer "Hear O Israel," %0aand with it to direct our desires upwards. Therefore, we must prolong the %0aword "one" in the six words: "Hear, O Israel, the Lord is our Creator, the %0aLord is one." %0a%0aIn correspondence with the instruction to prolong the word "one," he who %0autters this verse should pronounce this word lengthily, as ooone. However, The %0aZohar obviously alludes not to a simple utterance of one's mouth, but rather to %0aour true heartfelt intentions. %0a%0aWhat is indicated here is that one needs to know and make a union. First, %0aone must know the two sides of love, AVI and YESHSUT. AVI are called the %0a"big and great ones in Hassadim," whereas YESHSUT is called "the Master of the %0aWorld," for it contains judgment and restriction. %0a%0aAfter man has attained both degrees of love and merited perfect love, he %0aneeds to know that there is a great Master who governs the entire world, and %0ato unite this knowledge every day by using the six Supernal limbs, sides, that is, %0ato raise MAN to ZON de Atzilut, and ZON will raise their MAN to YESHSUT. %0aAs a result, ZON and YESHSUT will ascend and unite with Partzuf AVI. This %0acommon Partzuf has six Supernal sides-limbs, for they all clothe VAK, the six %0alower Sefirot of AA. %0a%0aBecause of this unity, YESHSUT ascends above Parsa de AA, to the place %0afrom the Peh down to the Chazeh, the place of the Supernal Waters. This is the %0apermanent place of AVI, and the place where Light is revealed. When YESHSUT %0ais filled with this Light, it passes it to ZON, which pass it on to the lower worlds, %0aleading to the revelation of Ohr Hassadim in all the worlds. This is the secret of %0athe union of "Hear, O Israel." %0a%0a%0a%0a393 %0a%0a%0a%0a394 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aThe six words: "Hear, O Israel, the Lord is our Creator, the Lord is One" %0aconstitute the six sides of ZON, which need to be united so as to unite them %0awith the six Supernal sides, that is, AVI and YESHSUT. And man must direct %0ahis intentions and NRN upwards, so they, too, would unite with Supernal unity, %0ajust as MAN. %0a%0aTo achieve unity in VAK de ZA, in its six sides, the word "one" must be %0aprolonged, meaning to receive Ohr Hochma within it, for Ohr Hochma descends %0afrom Ein Sof (infinity) to Supernal VAK, i.e., to AVI and YESHSUT, and unites %0aVAK de ZA with the Light of Ein Sof. This is because the Gematria (numerical %0avalue) of the Hebrew word Echad (one) is Aleph + Chet + Dalet =1 + 8 + 4= 13, %0awhich indicates reception of Ohr Hochma. %0a%0aHence, while pronouncing the word "one," one should intend to draw %0aOhr Hochma to VAK de ZA. However, this unity lacks the intention to receive %0athe Light of GAR in ZA, but only to enlarge its VAK through unity with the %0aSupernal VAK, and to receive VAK de Gadlut. %0a%0a205. It is therefore written, "Let the waters under the Heavens be gathered %0atogether onto one place." This means that all the degrees under the Heavens %0awill gather onto one place, to become perfect in the six ends. Therewith, fear %0amust be attached to the unity of the words: "Hear, O Israel," which is done by %0aprolonging the pronunciation of the letter Dalet in the word Echad. This is %0awhy the letter Dalet in the word Echad is written larger than the other letters. %0aIt is written, "Let the dry land appear," to let the letter Dalet (designating dry %0aland) be attached to that unity. %0a%0aAs was already explained, the unity contained in the words "Hear, O Israel" %0arefers to the reception of Gadlut by VAK. This is because "one place" signifies %0athe Supernal VAK, where the Light of Ein Sof shines within Ohr Hochma, under %0athe Heavens (Bina), with regard to the earth (ZA). The words "onto one place" %0aimply the unification of all the six Upper and lower sides, so the lower Partzufim %0awill receive Ohr Hochma and unite with VAK de ZA, but only as VAK de Gadlut. %0a%0aAs we have already clarified, there are two kinds of fear and two kinds of %0alove: the Upper fear and love are called AVI, whereas the lower fear and love are %0acalled YESHSUT. However, perfection is attained only by attaining both degrees %0atogether. Hence, the Light is concealed in YESHSUT, so the lower kind of love %0a("even if He takes away the soul") will be revealed. But even in this case, fear %0amust cling to love and prevent the hardening of the heart; only then does one %0areveal perfect love, merges with AVI and YESHSUT, and receives the complete %0aCreator's goodness. %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Third Commandment %0a%0a%0a%0a395 %0a%0a%0a%0aIn the unity of "Hear, O Israel," and after ZON ascend and unite with their %0aproperties in the six Upper sides to receive within them the "Great Love" in the %0aword "one," they receive the Light that was made on the first day of creation, of %0awhich it is written: "And the Creator said, 'Let there be Light'" (Beresheet, 1:3). %0a%0aAnd to all of this unity one must attach fear, since he needs to reveal and %0areceive the Light that is deliberately concealed in YESHSUT, so as to unite the %0alower love and fear, for they still cannot be considered perfect. %0a%0aTherefore, it is said that one should prolong the pronunciation of the Dalet %0ain the word Echad (one) when reciting the prayer, Shema Israel, Adonay Eloheinu, %0aAdonay EchaD-D-Dl (Hear, O Israel, the Lord is our Creator, the Lord is One). %0aIn this case, the letter Dalet is written in large font. This is because big letters %0arefer to Tvuna, and the big Dalet in the word Echad indicates that its place is in %0aTvuna, and that the Light is concealed there. By attracting it, not by utterance, %0aof course, but by the spiritual action, man unites its concealment with the lower %0afear and love. %0a%0aAND THE DRY LAND APPEARED means that there is no perfection %0ain the Upper fear and love, expressed in the six words of the prayer "Hear, %0aO Israel" with the help of the word "one." These words correspond to "Let %0athere be Light," until the unity of fear and love is achieved below. This unity is %0arevealed in the Light that is concealed in Tvuna, designated by the letter Dalet %0a(D) in the word Echad. %0a%0aTherefore, after the WATERS GATHERED TOGETHER ONTO ONE %0aPLACE, signifying the descent of Ohr Hochma into the six parts of ZA, DRY %0aLAND APPEARED. It denotes the letter Dalet in the word Echad, which should %0abe pronounced with (spiritual) prolongation, with the aim to turn it into land %0athrough the concealment of the Light. %0a%0aAll of this is essential in order to unite the D, Tvuna, with AVI, resulting in %0athe descent of the Light to VAK de ZON, so that love could be made perfect. %0a%0a206. After Mcdchut unites with ZA Above (in VAK de ZON), they must %0anow be united below, in the masses, i.e., in all six sides of Malchut, in %0athe words, BARUCH SHEM KVOD MALCHUTO LEOLAM VAED %0a(Blessed be the great name of His kingdom for ever and ever), which contain %0asix other words of unity. And then, what was dry land will become fertile %0asoil, yielding fruit and plant. %0a%0aAfter the Supernal union is achieved, when the letter Dalet in the word %0aEchad becomes whole Above, in AVI, it is essential to unite the Dalet in the %0aword Echad below, in VAK, in the six aspects of Nukva de ZA (Rachel), who %0a%0a%0a%0a396 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0astands from Chazeh de ZA and below. All 600,000 souls of Israel, called "the %0ainhabitants of Nukva," are included in Rachel. %0a%0aAfter ZA unites in the Light of AVI, and the concealment of Tvuna (in the %0awords DRY LAND APPEARED or in the letter Dalet) is revealed in him, Nukva %0amust be filled with these two revelations. This is designated by the six words, %0aBARUCH SHEM KVOD MALCHUTO LEOLAM VAED, corresponding to the %0asix Sefirot HGT NHY of Nukva. %0a%0aIt was already explained that the Light was concealed in order to reveal %0aboth sides of love— good and evil. Yet, neither side of love, good or evil, can %0abe revealed through concealment, but only through revelation of judgment. %0aBefore judgment was revealed, the letter Dalet in the word Echad was DRY %0aLAND— utterly useless. This is because it emerged from the Light due to the %0aconcealment. Even fear to unite in the lower fear and love, which supplement %0athe Upper fear and love was absent from it, for the judgment that reveals the %0alower fear and love was not yet revealed. %0a%0aStrictness and judgment are located in the legs of Partzuf Leah, which are %0aincluded in the Rosh of Partzuf Rachel. ZA has two Nukvaot (plural for Nu/cva): %0aLeah (above his Chazeh) and Rachel (below his Chazeh). Leah's legs end at the %0aChazeh de ZA and touch Rachel's Rosh. %0a%0a%0a%0aWorld of Atzilut %0a%0a%0a%0aAtik %0a%0a%0aAA %0a%0a%0aAVI %0a%0a%0aYESHSUT %0a%0a%0aNukvaotofZA %0a%0a%0aZA %0a%0a%0aLeah: Head %0a%0a%0aHead %0a%0a%0aBody %0a%0a%0aMouth %0a%0a%0aLegs %0a%0a%0aChest %0a%0a%0aRachel: Head %0a%0a%0aChest %0a%0a%0aBody %0a%0a%0aLegs %0a%0a%0aLegs %0a%0a%0aFeet %0a%0a%0a%0aWorlds of BYA %0a%0aMachsom %0a%0aOur World %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Third Commandment %0a%0a%0a%0a397 %0a%0a%0a%0aSince strictness and judgment are located at the end of the legs of Partzuf %0aLeah, this affects only Partzuf Rachel, as each spiritual property acts only from %0athe place of its manifestation and below. Therefore, the concealment in the %0alower love and fear manifests only in the place in Rachel where the force of %0astrictness and judgment is manifested. %0a%0aPrior to the revelation of judgment, the letter Dalet in the word Echad was %0adry land, a place that is unfit for living. Now, however, after the descent of Partzuf %0aRachel into VAK, below Chazeh de ZA, the dry land became fertile, suitable for %0asettlement and cultivation of fruits. In other words, the lower love and fear %0awere revealed in it in completion and perfection. And they complement the %0aUpper love and fear, so that all are perfect on both sides, for that is when all the %0agoodness is revealed in AVI. %0a%0aIt is therefore said, THE CREATOR CALLED THE DRY LAND EARTH- %0aERETZ (the word Eretz is derived from Ration— desire), for it is the property of %0athe letter Dalet in the word Echad in the six Sefirot (sides) of Nukva de ZA (where %0athe property of strictness and judgment is already revealed). The letter Dalet that %0awas in DRY LAND and made its property inanimate and unfit to live on turns %0ainto EARTH in Nukva de ZA (as a result of a Zivug with ZA), can now be settled %0aand cultivated; hence, the Creator called it "earth." %0a%0a207. It is written, AND THE CREATOR CALLED THE DRY LAND EARTH. %0aThis refers to the same unity below, by the words, BLESSED BE HIS GREAT %0aNAME FOR EVER AND EVER, when the earth, called "desire," became %0awhat it should be. For the word "earth" (Eretz) means desire (Ratzon). Hence, %0athe expression IT WAS GOOD appears twice on the third day of creation: %0aonce for the Upper unity and once for the lower. For Malchut merges with %0aboth sides of ZA— with VAK de ZA and with her own VAK. Henceforth, the %0aearth brings forth grass, for it has been corrected to yield fruit. %0a%0aThe Upper unity (described by the words, WATERS GATHERED %0aTOGETHER ONTO ONE PLACE) passes the Light that was created on the %0afirst day of creation from Above downwards, from the six Upper sides of AVI %0ato VAK de ZA. This is called by the first word, IT WAS GOOD, uttered by the %0aCreator on the third day of creation. %0a%0aAnd then occurs the lower unity, designated by the verse, BLESSED BE HIS %0aGREAT NAME FOR EVER AND EVER. This means that the letter Dalet in %0athe word Echad attains perfection only from the six sides of Nu/cva, as described %0aby the verses, AND THE CREATOR CALLED THE DRY LAND EARTH and %0a%0a%0a%0a398 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aTHE EARTH SHALL BRING FORTH GRASS, for in VAK de Nukva, DRY %0aLAND turned to EARTH, yielding fruits. %0a%0aWith regard to this unity of VAK de Nukva, the Creator said, IT WAS %0aGOOD, for the second time on the third day of creation. It follows that when %0aIT WAS GOOD is said for the first time, it refers to the Upper unity. And the %0asecond time refers to the lower. Because of the lower unity, both sides of love %0aachieve perfection, and the Light of AVI descends to VAK de Nukva, and bears %0afruit for the 600,000 souls of Israel that inhabit her.

This %0a%3c common Partzuf has six Supernal sides-limbs, for they all clothe VAK, the six %0a%3c lower Sefirot of AA. %0a%3c %0a%3c Because of this unity, YESHSUT ascends above Parsa de AA, to the place %0a%3c from the Peh down to the Chazeh, the place of the Supernal Waters. This is the %0a%3c permanent place of AVI, and the place where Light is revealed. When YESHSUT %0a%3c is filled with this Light, it passes it to ZON, which pass it on to the lower worlds, %0a%3c leading to the revelation of Ohr Hassadim in all the worlds. This is the secret of %0a%3c the union of "Hear, O Israel." %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 393 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 394 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The six words: "Hear, O Israel, the Lord is our Creator, the Lord is One" %0a%3c constitute the six sides of ZON, which need to be united so as to unite them %0a%3c with the six Supernal sides, that is, AVI and YESHSUT. And man must direct %0a%3c his intentions and NRN upwards, so they, too, would unite with Supernal unity, %0a%3c just as MAN. %0a%3c %0a%3c To achieve unity in VAK de ZA, in its six sides, the word "one" must be %0a%3c prolonged, meaning to receive Ohr Hochma within it, for Ohr Hochma descends %0a%3c from Ein Sof (infinity) to Supernal VAK, i.e., to AVI and YESHSUT, and unites %0a%3c VAK de ZA with the Light of Ein Sof. This is because the Gematria (numerical %0a%3c value) of the Hebrew word Echad (one) is Aleph + Chet + Dalet =1 + 8 + 4= 13, %0a%3c which indicates reception of Ohr Hochma. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, while pronouncing the word "one," one should intend to draw %0a%3c Ohr Hochma to VAK de ZA. However, this unity lacks the intention to receive %0a%3c the Light of GAR in ZA, but only to enlarge its VAK through unity with the %0a%3c Supernal VAK, and to receive VAK de Gadlut. %0a%3c %0a%3c 205. It is therefore written, "Let the waters under the Heavens be gathered %0a%3c together onto one place." This means that all the degrees under the Heavens %0a%3c will gather onto one place, to become perfect in the six ends. Therewith, fear %0a%3c must be attached to the unity of the words: "Hear, O Israel," which is done by %0a%3c prolonging the pronunciation of the letter Dalet in the word Echad. This is %0a%3c why the letter Dalet in the word Echad is written larger than the other letters. %0a%3c It is written, "Let the dry land appear," to let the letter Dalet (designating dry %0a%3c land) be attached to that unity. %0a%3c %0a%3c As was already explained, the unity contained in the words "Hear, O Israel" %0a%3c refers to the reception of Gadlut by VAK. This is because "one place" signifies %0a%3c the Supernal VAK, where the Light of Ein Sof shines within Ohr Hochma, under %0a%3c the Heavens (Bina), with regard to the earth (ZA). The words "onto one place" %0a%3c imply the unification of all the six Upper and lower sides, so the lower Partzufim %0a%3c will receive Ohr Hochma and unite with VAK de ZA, but only as VAK de Gadlut. %0a%3c %0a%3c As we have already clarified, there are two kinds of fear and two kinds of %0a%3c love: the Upper fear and love are called AVI, whereas the lower fear and love are %0a%3c called YESHSUT. However, perfection is attained only by attaining both degrees %0a%3c together. Hence, the Light is concealed in YESHSUT, so the lower kind of love %0a%3c ("even if He takes away the soul") will be revealed. But even in this case, fear %0a%3c must cling to love and prevent the hardening of the heart; only then does one %0a%3c reveal perfect love, merges with AVI and YESHSUT, and receives the complete %0a%3c Creator's goodness. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Third Commandment %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 395 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c In the unity of "Hear, O Israel," and after ZON ascend and unite with their %0a%3c properties in the six Upper sides to receive within them the "Great Love" in the %0a%3c word "one," they receive the Light that was made on the first day of creation, of %0a%3c which it is written: "And the Creator said, 'Let there be Light'" (Beresheet, 1:3). %0a%3c %0a%3c And to all of this unity one must attach fear, since he needs to reveal and %0a%3c receive the Light that is deliberately concealed in YESHSUT, so as to unite the %0a%3c lower love and fear, for they still cannot be considered perfect. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, it is said that one should prolong the pronunciation of the Dalet %0a%3c in the word Echad (one) when reciting the prayer, Shema Israel, Adonay Eloheinu, %0a%3c Adonay EchaD-D-Dl (Hear, O Israel, the Lord is our Creator, the Lord is One). %0a%3c In this case, the letter Dalet is written in large font. This is because big letters %0a%3c refer to Tvuna, and the big Dalet in the word Echad indicates that its place is in %0a%3c Tvuna, and that the Light is concealed there. By attracting it, not by utterance, %0a%3c of course, but by the spiritual action, man unites its concealment with the lower %0a%3c fear and love. %0a%3c %0a%3c AND THE DRY LAND APPEARED means that there is no perfection %0a%3c in the Upper fear and love, expressed in the six words of the prayer "Hear, %0a%3c O Israel" with the help of the word "one." These words correspond to "Let %0a%3c there be Light," until the unity of fear and love is achieved below. This unity is %0a%3c revealed in the Light that is concealed in Tvuna, designated by the letter Dalet %0a%3c (D) in the word Echad. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, after the WATERS GATHERED TOGETHER ONTO ONE %0a%3c PLACE, signifying the descent of Ohr Hochma into the six parts of ZA, DRY %0a%3c LAND APPEARED. It denotes the letter Dalet in the word Echad, which should %0a%3c be pronounced with (spiritual) prolongation, with the aim to turn it into land %0a%3c through the concealment of the Light. %0a%3c %0a%3c All of this is essential in order to unite the D, Tvuna, with AVI, resulting in %0a%3c the descent of the Light to VAK de ZON, so that love could be made perfect. %0a%3c %0a%3c 206. After Mcdchut unites with ZA Above (in VAK de ZON), they must %0a%3c now be united below, in the masses, i.e., in all six sides of Malchut, in %0a%3c the words, BARUCH SHEM KVOD MALCHUTO LEOLAM VAED %0a%3c (Blessed be the great name of His kingdom for ever and ever), which contain %0a%3c six other words of unity. And then, what was dry land will become fertile %0a%3c soil, yielding fruit and plant. %0a%3c %0a%3c After the Supernal union is achieved, when the letter Dalet in the word %0a%3c Echad becomes whole Above, in AVI, it is essential to unite the Dalet in the %0a%3c word Echad below, in VAK, in the six aspects of Nukva de ZA (Rachel), who %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 396 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c stands from Chazeh de ZA and below. All 600,000 souls of Israel, called "the %0a%3c inhabitants of Nukva," are included in Rachel. %0a%3c %0a%3c After ZA unites in the Light of AVI, and the concealment of Tvuna (in the %0a%3c words DRY LAND APPEARED or in the letter Dalet) is revealed in him, Nukva %0a%3c must be filled with these two revelations. This is designated by the six words, %0a%3c BARUCH SHEM KVOD MALCHUTO LEOLAM VAED, corresponding to the %0a%3c six Sefirot HGT NHY of Nukva. %0a%3c %0a%3c It was already explained that the Light was concealed in order to reveal %0a%3c both sides of love— good and evil. Yet, neither side of love, good or evil, can %0a%3c be revealed through concealment, but only through revelation of judgment. %0a%3c Before judgment was revealed, the letter Dalet in the word Echad was DRY %0a%3c LAND— utterly useless.

ZA has two Nukvaot (plural for Nu/cva): %0a%3c Leah (above his Chazeh) and Rachel (below his Chazeh). Leah's legs end at the %0a%3c Chazeh de ZA and touch Rachel's Rosh. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c World of Atzilut %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Atik %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c AA %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c AVI %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c YESHSUT %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c NukvaotofZA %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ZA %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Leah: Head %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Head %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Body %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Mouth %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Legs %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chest %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Rachel: Head %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chest %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Body %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Legs %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Legs %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Feet %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Worlds of BYA %0a%3c %0a%3c Machsom %0a%3c %0a%3c Our World %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Third Commandment %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 397 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Since strictness and judgment are located at the end of the legs of Partzuf %0a%3c Leah, this affects only Partzuf Rachel, as each spiritual property acts only from %0a%3c the place of its manifestation and below. Therefore, the concealment in the %0a%3c lower love and fear manifests only in the place in Rachel where the force of %0a%3c strictness and judgment is manifested. %0a%3c %0a%3c Prior to the revelation of judgment, the letter Dalet in the word Echad was %0a%3c dry land, a place that is unfit for living. Now, however, after the descent of Partzuf %0a%3c Rachel into VAK, below Chazeh de ZA, the dry land became fertile, suitable for %0a%3c settlement and cultivation of fruits. In other words, the lower love and fear %0a%3c were revealed in it in completion and perfection. And they complement the %0a%3c Upper love and fear, so that all are perfect on both sides, for that is when all the %0a%3c goodness is revealed in AVI. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is therefore said, THE CREATOR CALLED THE DRY LAND EARTH- %0a%3c ERETZ (the word Eretz is derived from Ration— desire), for it is the property of %0a%3c the letter Dalet in the word Echad in the six Sefirot (sides) of Nukva de ZA (where %0a%3c the property of strictness and judgment is already revealed). The letter Dalet that %0a%3c was in DRY LAND and made its property inanimate and unfit to live on turns %0a%3c into EARTH in Nukva de ZA (as a result of a Zivug with ZA), can now be settled %0a%3c and cultivated; hence, the Creator called it "earth." %0a%3c %0a%3c 207. It is written, AND THE CREATOR CALLED THE DRY LAND EARTH. %0a%3c This refers to the same unity below, by the words, BLESSED BE HIS GREAT %0a%3c NAME FOR EVER AND EVER, when the earth, called "desire," became %0a%3c what it should be. For the word "earth" (Eretz) means desire (Ratzon). Hence, %0a%3c the expression IT WAS GOOD appears twice on the third day of creation: %0a%3c once for the Upper unity and once for the lower. For Malchut merges with %0a%3c both sides of ZA— with VAK de ZA and with her own VAK. Henceforth, the %0a%3c earth brings forth grass, for it has been corrected to yield fruit. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Upper unity (described by the words, WATERS GATHERED %0a%3c TOGETHER ONTO ONE PLACE) passes the Light that was created on the %0a%3c first day of creation from Above downwards, from the six Upper sides of AVI %0a%3c to VAK de ZA. This is called by the first word, IT WAS GOOD, uttered by the %0a%3c Creator on the third day of creation. %0a%3c %0a%3c And then occurs the lower unity, designated by the verse, BLESSED BE HIS %0a%3c GREAT NAME FOR EVER AND EVER. This means that the letter Dalet in %0a%3c the word Echad attains perfection only from the six sides of Nu/cva, as described %0a%3c by the verses, AND THE CREATOR CALLED THE DRY LAND EARTH and %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 398 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c THE EARTH SHALL BRING FORTH GRASS, for in VAK de Nukva, DRY %0a%3c LAND turned to EARTH, yielding fruits. %0a%3c %0a%3c With regard to this unity of VAK de Nukva, the Creator said, IT WAS %0a%3c GOOD, for the second time on the third day of creation. It follows that when %0a%3c IT WAS GOOD is said for the first time, it refers to the Upper unity. And the %0a%3c second time refers to the lower. Because of the lower unity, both sides of love %0a%3c achieve perfection, and the Light of AVI descends to VAK de Nukva, and bears %0a%3c fruit for the 600,000 souls of Israel that inhabit her. %0a\ No newline at end of file%0a
