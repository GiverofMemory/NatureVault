csum= comment:  ImRic 1 year ago I bought the 99X a few months back when I first saw this episode. actual cooked it today (oncamera). Its is so close I no longer worry about buying KFC. You must do double spice from recommended and 50%25 more salt.  I also cook it 20 minutes covered after it is browned on both sides flipping once. This gives it the texture that KFC has with its pressure cook method. You will never get it exact without the pressure cooker but the spice is correct. 469 Reply  Felix Corcoran 1 year ago
