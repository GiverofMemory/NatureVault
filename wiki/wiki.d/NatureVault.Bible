I do think following the Torah [[http://www.pocketoz.com.au/colours/covenants.html|#]] and Tanak (basically the whole old testament) is valuable for instruction on how to live and what sort of people to emulate and even the downfalls of people like David and Moses.%0a%0aI think the law is good and trustworthy and should be followed where at all possible.  In my estimation much of the law was implemented to fight bacteria and viruses and parasites and heavy metals, especially the talk about clean and unclean and what you should eat.  We now know that dangerous bacteria like [[vibrio]] is in certain non fish seafood, [[pasteurella]] in [[rabbits]], and also dangerous parasites like [[strongyloides]] in [[pig]]s and [[horse]]s.%0a%0aI believe in the teachings of Jesus and these should be considered and followed most of all.%0a%0aI do not believe in the overall benefit of the pauline letters to the churches including hebrews and what seems to be 2nd peter.  I believe they all had the same author, perhaps paul or one of his followers, even 2 peter.  James may be possibly in rebuke of Paul [[http://www.pocketoz.com.au/colours/revelation-trial.html|#]] and to me seems Jude is as well.  John seems fine.%0a%0aI do believe in the book of revelation and this book itself seems to basically condemn paul as a false apostle [[http://www.pocketoz.com.au/colours/revelation-trial.html|#]] [[http://www.pocketoz.com.au/colours/revelation.html|#]] [[http://www.pocketoz.com.au/colours/paul.html|#]]%0a%0aSince acts is so focused on Paul [[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2009/jan/05/christianity-acts-apostles|#]] I don't think it has much benefit.  Also I question Luke since it is widely thought it was the same author as acts, and admitted to not being an eyewitness [[https://www.quora.com/What-makes-Luke-different-from-the-other-gospels|#]]. Even if Acts is mostly a true recounting, it distracts from the teachings of jesus in the gospels in my opinion, which should be focused on first and foremost and will take a lifetime to integrate, just themselves.  Since Acts is about Paul mostly, not about Jesus' life and ministry it seems like paul is an [[antichrist]].%0a%0aMark may have pulled eucharist from Paul, and matthew may have pulled it from Mark [[https://www.huffpost.com/entry/eat-my-body-drink-my-bloo_b_4449548|#]] and is likely not what jesus said [[https://www.huffpost.com/entry/eat-my-body-drink-my-bloo_b_4449548|#]] [[http://www.pocketoz.com.au/colours/paul-mithra.html|#]].
