text=The Torah and Prayer %0a%0a%0a%0a180. Rabbi Shimon opened and said: "It is written that Hizkiyahu (Hezekiah) %0aturned his face to the wall and prayed to the Creator." Let us see how great %0aand potent the power of the Torah is, and how high it rises above all. He %0awho engages in the Torah has no fear of those Above or below, nor of any %0ahardships or illnesses of this world, for he is connected to the Tree of Life and %0alearns from it each day. %0a%0a181. For the Torah teaches man how to walk a path of truth; it teaches him %0ahow to return to his Master and cancel what is predestined for him. And %0aeven if man is shown that what is predestined for him cannot be cancelled, %0ait is nonetheless completely cancelled and annulled, then disappears at once %0aand does not prevail over him in this world. Hence, man should study the %0aTorah day and night, and never abandon it, as it is written: "Contemplate %0aHim day and night." Whomever abandons the Torah, it is as though he %0aabandons the Tree of Life. %0a%0a"Contemplate Him day and night"— "Him" implies the Creator! In another %0aplace in The Zohar, it is said that Hizkiyahu's prayer was accepted by the Creator, %0afor nothing (no egoistic desires) separated him from the wall (the Shechina, the %0asensation of the Creator, akin to the Wailing Wall). %0a%0aThis was the advice that he received from the Torah, when, through his %0aefforts in the Torah, he realized how to achieve complete return to the Creator, %0awhereby nothing would separate him from the Creator (from the wall, the %0aShechina, the sensation of the Creator). As a result, the decree of his death (the %0aLight's exit from the Partzuf) was revoked. So great is the power of the Torah. %0a%0a182. Come and see— such is the advice given to man. When he goes to bed at %0anight, he must accept the Creator's governance from Above, and wholeheartedly %0a%0a365 %0a%0a%0a%0a366 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aentrust his soul with Him. Thus, man is immediately spared all the illnesses, %0aslander, and evil eyes, and they will no longer have power over him. %0a%0aHere we come to a precise understanding of certain definitions from the %0aTorah, which are quite different from the notions that we are accustomed to. %0aDaylight signifies the sensation of unity with the Creator. It is called "Light," for %0athis is how man defines his good feelings. Therefore, daylight is when man feels %0acloseness of the Creator and the greatness of spirituality. %0a%0aDarkness coincides with nighttime in our world. Accordingly, with regard %0ato man's spiritual states, darkness designates the absence of the sensation of the %0aCreator, of the Upper Light, due to the actions of the impure, egoistic forces that %0aseparate man from the Creator. At night in our world, we sleep. The spiritual %0aPartzuf is filled with the minimal amount of Light in an unconscious state called %0a"sleep." The amount of Light within the Partzuf is so little that it is defined as %0aone sixtieth— 6 (Sefirot of ZA) x 10 (in each part)— of death or complete absence %0aof spiritual Light, for the impure forces rule here. %0a%0aDue to these two forces that govern and control us, we cannot completely %0aand permanently merge with the Creator. As the result of our sensation of the %0astate of night, the impure forces that rule at night impede us in our efforts, for %0atheir power over us keeps returning, thus creating gaps in our unity with the %0aCreator and in our work for His sake. %0a%0aTo correct this, Rabbi Shimon gives us his advice: every "night" (a feeling %0aof separation from the spiritual), when man goes to "sleep" (sinks deeper into %0athe sensations of this world), he must wholeheartedly accept the Creator's %0agovernance, entrust himself completely under His rule. For if the night (the %0asensation of night) is corrected as in the act of creation, when day follows night, %0aas it is said, "And there was evening and there was morning, one day," both %0anight and day become as a single whole. %0a%0aAnd the night, called "the rule of Malchut," shall not mix with any impure %0aforce, and shall not attack man because of the disappearance of the sensation of %0athe Creator on account of egoistic desires and obstacles of "reason." For first, %0aman has realized the necessity of the night for the attainment of the next day %0a(greater sensation of the Creator, a bigger altruistic desire), and perceives these %0atwo states as a single whole and as an advancement, despite the fact that in his %0asensations, a night designates remoteness from spirituality. %0a%0a%0a%0afrom the Creator, and is therefore without joy, despite all the possible pleasures, %0a%0a%0a%0a%0ae language of spiritual work, this means that if man feels remi %0a%0a%0a%0a%0afor him thi %0a%0a%0a%0ais called "night." I %0a%0a%0a%0asely %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Torah and Prayer %0a%0a%0a%0a367 %0a%0a%0a%0aabsence of sensation and lack of faith in the Creator that man can, through his %0aown effort, without feeling any taste in the Torah, yield before the Creator's rule. %0aThat is, he closes his eyes (as one who goes to sleep) and says: "I bring myself %0aunder the Creator's rule and submit to His will." This state is called "descent %0afor the sake of a subsequent ascent," and serves as a springboard, by which man %0aattains an even brighter "day." %0a%0aHowever, to this end man must completely accept the Supernal Kingdom's %0arule, so that nothing will separate him from the Creator. In other words, he %0amust submit to the Supernal Rule unconditionally, whether it brings life or %0adeath, so that no force in the world will be able to stop him from uniting with %0athe Supernal Ruler, as it is written, "Love your Creator with all your heart, with %0aall your soul and with all your might" (Devarim, 6:5). %0a%0aIf man accepts everything that the Creator sends him with all his heart, he %0ais certain that nothing will separate him from the Creator. This determines the %0afulfillment of the condition of entrusting one's soul with the Creator. For he %0agives himself into the Creator's hands in advance, by deciding to fulfill all His %0adesires (commandments) to the fullest, right up to self-sacrifice. %0a%0aHence, as man sleeps, when his soul (the sensation of the Creator), the %0a*ht that previously filled him, leaves his body (desires), he does not feel the %0ath part of death, for the impure (egoistic) forces have no power %0a;r words, they do not separate him from the Creator. Rather, %0aIs to feel the Creator temporarily. %0a%0aThus, the impure forces cannot interrupt his spiritual work even in the state %0acalled "night," for his evening and morning are already as one day— the Creator's %0aLight. The night becomes a part of the day, for it is precisely because of the night %0athat he recognizes his future merit of receiving an even greater Light. %0a%0aThis is because his night stems not from the rule of the impure forces. %0aInstead, he understands that the Creator intentionally sends him such states, %0ahus, even in such sensations as darkness and lack of feeling, absence %0aand taste for the spiritual, he sees an opportunity to merge witl %0a%0a%0a%0a%0a183. And in the morning, when he rises from his bed, he must bless the %0aCreator, enter His house, and bow before Him in fear and trepidation, and %0aonly then should he pray. He should take advice of his holy Patriarchs, as it is %0awritten, "By Your great mercy shall I come into Your house, to bow in fear of %0aYour holy greatness." %0a%0a%0a%0a368 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aThanks to Your great kindness, I can now bless You for being merciful to %0ame, for ending my spiritual descent, and for letting me come into Your house %0aonce more, for allowing me to feel You. However, I am happy not because my %0asuffering gave way to pleasure, but because now I can thank You. I come to Your %0ahouse so as to kneel in awe before Your holy greatness, which I now attain more %0athan ever before. %0a%0aThe prayer in our heart is the correction within Malchut (the Shechina, the %0asensation of the Creator, or the common soul of Israel), and the fulfillment %0aof this common soul with the Upper Light (the sensation of the Creator), in %0aaccordance with all of its corrected desires. Hence, all our pleas are expressed %0ain plural form, for we pray not for our own soul, but for the common soul of %0aIsrael. Naturally, all that is present in the Shechina is subsequently present in %0aevery soul of Israel, and vice versa, all that the common soul of Israel lacks is %0aalso absent in each soul. %0a%0aTherefore, before we start praying, we need to understand (feel) what is %0alacking in Malchut (the Shechina), to know what we need to correct in her and %0ahow we can fulfill her. Our heart, the center of our desires, is a part of this %0aMalchut (the Shechina). All the generations of Israel are included in the common %0asoul— the Shechina. However, we need not correct what has already been corrected %0aby previous generations, but only what is left after those generations of souls. %0a%0aOur Patriarchs, the spiritual Partzufim called "Avraham, Yitzchakand Yaakov," %0aalso known as the Sefirot Hesed, Gevura, and Tifferet of Partzuf ZA de Atzilut, %0ainclude the entire community of Israel, all the properties that subsequently %0amanifest in the corrected Malchut, who, in her corrected state, is called "Israel." %0aThe Patriarchs designate the three spiritual roots of the 600,000 souls of Israel %0ain all the generations. In other words, these are the three sources of desires born %0awithin man's part of Malchut for the purpose of his correction. %0a%0aAll the good deeds, the reception and bestowal of Light carried out by %0athe "community of Israel" (by Kabbalists) in all the generations, first trigger %0areception of the Upper Light by our holy Patriarchs (Sefirot de ZA), for all the %0aUpper Light descends through them from Above downwards. From them, this %0aUpper Light descends onto the "community of Israel," the righteous of that %0ageneration who exist with their properties in the worlds of BYA, and evoke the %0adescent of this Light with their prayers. %0a%0aSuch is the order of spiritual degrees: each branch can receive only through %0aits root (the preceding, Higher Degree), but never independently. The main %0aLight remains in the root, and only an insignificant part of it descends to the %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Torah and Prayer %0a%0a%0a%0a369 %0a%0a%0a%0abranch that evokes it. Therefore, all the corrections completed in the community %0aof Israel (the Shechina, the common soul) are stored and preserved in the souls %0aof our holy Patriarchs. %0a%0a(The Light received in the corrected Kelim remains forever within them. %0aOur description of the Light's exit and descent should be understood as a %0ametaphor, for the Partzuf receives new empty desires that require correction, and %0athe sensation of emptiness from the received empty desires is perceived as the %0aLight's departure. Nevertheless, upon correcting these newly received desires, in %0athem the Partzuf will receive an even greater Light than before). %0a%0aTherefore, the essence of our prayer lies in supplementing the Shechina with %0awhatever it needs to achieve complete correction, after all the previous corrections %0athat were performed in it by the past generations of Kabbalists. Hence, he who %0aspiritually ascends must first make all the corrections that have already been %0aperformed in the Shechina, and only then will he be able to recognize what is left %0afor him to correct. %0a%0aThis is why it is written that one cannot enter the Beit Knesset (synagogue, %0abut in Hebrew it means "the house of assembly" or "the house of prayer," from %0athe word Kones— "to assemble") before he assembles his prayer and asks the holy %0aPatriarchs for guidance, for he needs to know what has already been corrected %0aand what still needs to be corrected. This is possible only after he receives %0aeverything that the Patriarchs have corrected through the Shechina. Only then %0awill he come to know what is left for him to correct in the Shechina. %0a%0aThe Patriarchs have corrected the prayer in the Shechina. Prayer and the %0aShechina are one and the same, for prayer is a request, a raising of MAN, a Kli, the %0acorrected Malchut or the desire for the Creator's sake. The correction performed %0aby Avraham is called Shacharit (the morning prayer), by Yitzchak— Mincha (the %0aafternoon prayer), and by Yaakov— Arvit (the evening prayer). Therefore, one %0amust first repeat in his prayer everything that was already corrected by them, %0aand then he will discover how to construct his personal plea, and what other %0aimperfections are left that only he can, and consequently, must correct. %0a%0a184. Man cannot enter the Beit Knesset (synagogue, house of prayer) unless %0ahe first receives permission from Avraham, Yitzchak and Yaakov, for they %0ahave corrected the prayer to the Creator. It is therefore written, "And in Your %0agreat mercy shall I enter into Your house" (Tehilim, 5:8). The aforesaid refers %0ato Avraham, for his property is mercy, the Sefira Hesed. "I will bow before %0aYour holy chamber" refers to Yitzchak, for thanks to him Malchut is called %0aHeichal— chamber, the Sefira Qevura. "In fear and trepidation" refers to %0a%0a%0a%0a370 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aYaakov, for his property is the Sefira Tifferet, called "fear." And man must %0afirst enter into these properties, and only then enter the Beit Knesset to raise %0ahis prayers. Such a state is described by the verse, "Here is My slave, Israel, by %0awhom I am adorned." %0a%0aHere The Zohar analyzes the first three main corrections, made by the %0aPatriarchs in the Shechina. Avraham corrected the property called Bait (house, %0apermanent dwelling), which allows man to merge with it and to always exist in %0athe Creator's properties and sensations, just as he can always dwell in his house. %0a%0aYitzchak complemented the correction and corrected Maichut in the %0aproperty called the "holy temple," so that the King Himself would always dwell %0ain it, as a king always dwells in his chambers. Yaakov added to the correction %0aby the property of fear, which corresponds to a gate in front of a house, and %0adesignates the condition that (if met) allows man to enter Maichut, Avraham's %0ahouse, and into Yitzchak's holy temple that are both within her. %0a%0aUpon including within him all three corrections of the Patriarchs in full %0aperfection, he attains what has already been corrected in the holy Shechina, and %0athen proceeds to correct what has not been corrected. %0a%0aAvraham is the source of the property of mercy in the souls of Israel. %0aTherefore, he corrected the holy Shechina in such a way that it could receive %0aOhr Hassadim, the Light of Mercy. And the Shechina received this Light in its %0aentirety for all the souls of Israel. Had it remained this way, all the souls of %0aIsrael would have been in complete and eternal unity with the Creator, and %0athe Shechina would have been filled with Light (pleasure). Thus, no man would %0aever wish to part with the Shechina (the sensation of the Creator) even for a %0asingle moment. %0a%0aYet, Avraham's entire correction consisted in the creation of a perfect, %0abestowing Kli, which consisted only of Ohr Hassadim. There was no way of %0acorrupting its properties or introducing imperfection within it, for, just like %0aAvraham's property of mercy (Hesed), this Kli (desire) consisted only of the will %0ato bestow upon, and please the Creator, as it is written: "Mine is yours and yours %0ais yours designates the property of mercy" (Avot, 85). By imparting creation with %0ahis property, Avraham completely separated the impure forces (thoughts and %0adesires) from the Shechina, and made it completely holy and pure. %0a%0aHowever, the Thought of Creation does not end here, for it lies in fulfilling %0athe souls with delight. And the extent of pleasure depends on the aspiration to %0aenjoy, on the degree of hunger. Only the extent of preliminary hunger, the will to %0areceive pleasure, determines the extent of the subsequent reception of pleasure. %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Torah and Prayer %0a%0a%0a%0a371 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Shechina (Malchut de Atzilut, the sum of the souls) received its correction %0afrom Avraham— the Supernal force of Hassadim, the Sefira Hesed of ZA de Atzilut— %0aand acquired the property of mercy from it. This property is completely free %0afrom any selfish will to receive, that is, its desire to receive something from the %0aCreator has completely disappeared, and only the will to bestow upon Him %0aremains. This desire is called "bestowal for the sake of bestowal." However, this %0abrought no correction to the souls (parts of the Shechina), for their role is to %0areceive the pleasure prepared for them by the Creator. To that end, they must %0afirst have the "will to receive." After all, pleasure is felt only when preceded by %0aan aspiration or desire for it, and is determined by the extent of this desire. %0a%0aIt is hence written that Avraham fathered Yitzchak: Yitzchak found the %0aShechina in absolute spiritual perfection, in the property of pure selfless bestowal, %0afilled with Ohr Hassadim because of all the corrections made by Avraham. %0aHowever, in accordance with his properties, Yitzchak (the left spiritual force) %0afelt imperfection in this state of the Shechina— that it was not yet corrected to %0a"receive" all that was conceived in the Thought of Creation. %0a%0aTherefore, he corrected it by turning it into a Kli (vessel) of reception, %0aby supplementing it with the will "to receive," so that it could receive all the %0aperfection prepared for it. Yitzchak evoked in the Shechina the will to receive %0apleasure from the Creator, albeit in the form of "reception for the Creator's %0asake"— with the intention of receiving pleasure in order to delight Him. %0a%0aThe reception for the Creator's sake means that although man fervently %0awishes to receive pleasure, he receives not because he wishes to enjoy, but only %0abecause the bestowing Creator wishes for him to receive it. And had the Creator %0anot wished it so, man would have no desire to receive from Him. %0a%0aReception for the Creator's sake is equivalent to selfless bestowal. Thus, the %0aegoistic, impure force, cannot cling to such a desire. %0a%0aHence, Yitzchak corrected the Shechina and brought it to complete perfection, %0afor now it can receive all that the Creator conceived to bestow upon it, as this is %0athe purpose of His creation. %0a%0aThus, after being corrected by Yitzchak, the state of Malchut-Shechina is %0acalled Heichal (the Creator's chambers), for now He can fill it with Himself, His %0aLight, which means that He dwells in its halls. %0a%0aYet, Avraham's correction, called "house," did not yet allow the Shechina to %0abe filled and worthy of the Creator's presence. Hence, Yitzchak is considered %0ato have corrected all the Gevurot (willpower and resistance to egoism in the %0asouls of Israel). This means that he mitigated all the laws and restrictions in the %0a%0a%0a%0a372 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aCreator's governance. This is because all restrictions and punishments come into %0athis world for the sole purpose of correcting the souls' will to receive, to make %0athem suitable for reception of the infinite goodness contained in the Thought %0aof Creation. And since Yitzchak corrected the Shechina to complete perfection, %0aall its restrictions and forces have been corrected, and all of its properties have %0aattained the desired goal. %0a%0aHowever, his correction, too, did not retain this form in the Shechina, and %0abecame corrupted, for the world was still unprepared for the end of correction. %0aHence, Yitzchak fathered a sinner, Esav, who, being unable to resist the temptation %0ato receive for himself, corrupted Yitzchak's correction in the Shechina. Unlike %0aYitzchak, he could not resist the selfish reception. This means that even when it %0abecame clear to him that the bestowing Creator did not wish for him to receive, %0ahe wanted to receive nonetheless, for such was his desire of self-gratification. %0a%0aTherefore, the impure force (Klipot-shells, the husk, or rind surrounding %0athe pure forces) clung to the Shechina. Thus, the legs (Sefirot NHYM) of Partzuf %0aMalchut de Atzilut descended to the place of the Klipot below Parsa, where egoistic %0adesires dominate the desires of NHYM. %0a%0aYet, the Rosh and the Upper Part of the Guf down to the Tabur of Partzuf %0aMalchut remained above the rule of the impure forces. Hence, his head (Rosh) %0aunderstands how he should act (hence, Yitzchak's head is buried together with %0athe bodies of Avraham and Yaakov in the Machpela cave), but the body (Guf) still %0awants to receive pleasure for its own sake. %0a%0aAnd since Yaakov saw the damage caused by Esav, he corrected the Shechina %0aby adding his property of fear to it, as it is written: "His hand had hold on Esav's %0aheel" (The Torah, Beresheet, 25:26). Because Yaakov realized what imperfection %0aEsav had caused in Shechina (in the created souls), he corrected himself in fear %0ato such an extent that he raised the holy Shechina as a crown-adornment. By this %0ahe also retained the corrections made by Avraham and Yitzchak. %0a%0aHowever, Yaakov's correction was not final, for this fear is more similar to %0athe fear of transgression than the selfless fear that comes from within. For this %0afear of his is born in him from Esav's hip, even though he had not transgressed %0aby receiving, as did Esav. But the end of correction will bring a different state: %0aEsav's hip will be annulled, as it is written: "Death will forever vanish from the %0aworld," and fear will remain only because the Creator is almighty and great. %0a%0aYaakov attained this genuine fear by himself. However, the entire "community %0aof Israel," all the souls that form the Shechina, still need to correct themselves %0ain all the generations, from the first to the last, to the end of correction. (Only %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Torah and Prayer %0a%0a%0a%0a373 %0a%0a%0a%0aMoshe attained the property of true fear— one out of greatness and love— only %0ahe, and no one else. Hence, as the Talmud says, description of fear out of love %0afor the Creator doesn't even exist.) %0a%0aThe Zohar cites the words of the Psalm (5:8): "By Your great mercy I shall %0acome into Your house," since Avraham corrected the Shechina up to the property %0aof a "house" that is filled with goodness, i.e., with Ohr Hassadim. The words, %0a"So as to bow before Your holy chamber," refer to Yitzchak, who corrected the %0aShechina from a "house" to a "chamber" that befits the Creator. The words, %0a"in fear" refer to Yaakov, who corrected the Shechina with his property of fear, %0awhereupon he made it a Kli (vessel) of reception that includes all the corrections %0amade by Avraham and Yitzchak. %0a%0aYet, how did he find out what else needed correction in the Shechina! Only %0aby correcting and including himself in these three corrections performed by the %0aholy Patriarchs before him. This means that, just as they did, Yaakov can act %0aaccording to the conditions of these corrections. In other words, Yaakov merged %0awith their properties, thereby ascending to their level. %0a%0aThus, man must first attain these properties and correct them within him. %0aOnly after he assumes the properties of these three corrections into himself can %0ahe start correcting them from where our Patriarch Yaakov left off, i.e., elevating %0afear to the extent of the Creator's greatness and omnipotence, and drawing the %0aUpper Light with his prayer, with his awe of the Creator's greatness. And the %0aUpper Light will bring with it the fulfillment of the Shechina and the end of %0aits correction. Hence, man's prayer must include two objectives: to obtain fear %0aof the Creator's true greatness, and with this attainment, to achieve the final %0acorrection of his egoism.

Rabbi Shimon opened and said: "It is written that Hizkiyahu (Hezekiah) %0a%3c turned his face to the wall and prayed to the Creator." Let us see how great %0a%3c and potent the power of the Torah is, and how high it rises above all. He %0a%3c who engages in the Torah has no fear of those Above or below, nor of any %0a%3c hardships or illnesses of this world, for he is connected to the Tree of Life and %0a%3c learns from it each day. %0a%3c %0a%3c 181. For the Torah teaches man how to walk a path of truth; it teaches him %0a%3c how to return to his Master and cancel what is predestined for him. And %0a%3c even if man is shown that what is predestined for him cannot be cancelled, %0a%3c it is nonetheless completely cancelled and annulled, then disappears at once %0a%3c and does not prevail over him in this world. Hence, man should study the %0a%3c Torah day and night, and never abandon it, as it is written: "Contemplate %0a%3c Him day and night." Whomever abandons the Torah, it is as though he %0a%3c abandons the Tree of Life. %0a%3c %0a%3c "Contemplate Him day and night"— "Him" implies the Creator! In another %0a%3c place in The Zohar, it is said that Hizkiyahu's prayer was accepted by the Creator, %0a%3c for nothing (no egoistic desires) separated him from the wall (the Shechina, the %0a%3c sensation of the Creator, akin to the Wailing Wall). %0a%3c %0a%3c This was the advice that he received from the Torah, when, through his %0a%3c efforts in the Torah, he realized how to achieve complete return to the Creator, %0a%3c whereby nothing would separate him from the Creator (from the wall, the %0a%3c Shechina, the sensation of the Creator). As a result, the decree of his death (the %0a%3c Light's exit from the Partzuf) was revoked. So great is the power of the Torah. %0a%3c %0a%3c 182. Come and see— such is the advice given to man. When he goes to bed at %0a%3c night, he must accept the Creator's governance from Above, and wholeheartedly %0a%3c %0a%3c 365 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 366 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c entrust his soul with Him. Thus, man is immediately spared all the illnesses, %0a%3c slander, and evil eyes, and they will no longer have power over him. %0a%3c %0a%3c Here we come to a precise understanding of certain definitions from the %0a%3c Torah, which are quite different from the notions that we are accustomed to. %0a%3c Daylight signifies the sensation of unity with the Creator. It is called "Light," for %0a%3c this is how man defines his good feelings. Therefore, daylight is when man feels %0a%3c closeness of the Creator and the greatness of spirituality. %0a%3c %0a%3c Darkness coincides with nighttime in our world. Accordingly, with regard %0a%3c to man's spiritual states, darkness designates the absence of the sensation of the %0a%3c Creator, of the Upper Light, due to the actions of the impure, egoistic forces that %0a%3c separate man from the Creator. At night in our world, we sleep. The spiritual %0a%3c Partzuf is filled with the minimal amount of Light in an unconscious state called %0a%3c "sleep." The amount of Light within the Partzuf is so little that it is defined as %0a%3c one sixtieth— 6 (Sefirot of ZA) x 10 (in each part)— of death or complete absence %0a%3c of spiritual Light, for the impure forces rule here. %0a%3c %0a%3c Due to these two forces that govern and control us, we cannot completely %0a%3c and permanently merge with the Creator. As the result of our sensation of the %0a%3c state of night, the impure forces that rule at night impede us in our efforts, for %0a%3c their power over us keeps returning, thus creating gaps in our unity with the %0a%3c Creator and in our work for His sake. %0a%3c %0a%3c To correct this, Rabbi Shimon gives us his advice: every "night" (a feeling %0a%3c of separation from the spiritual), when man goes to "sleep" (sinks deeper into %0a%3c the sensations of this world), he must wholeheartedly accept the Creator's %0a%3c governance, entrust himself completely under His rule. For if the night (the %0a%3c sensation of night) is corrected as in the act of creation, when day follows night, %0a%3c as it is said, "And there was evening and there was morning, one day," both %0a%3c night and day become as a single whole. %0a%3c %0a%3c And the night, called "the rule of Malchut," shall not mix with any impure %0a%3c force, and shall not attack man because of the disappearance of the sensation of %0a%3c the Creator on account of egoistic desires and obstacles of "reason." For first, %0a%3c man has realized the necessity of the night for the attainment of the next day %0a%3c (greater sensation of the Creator, a bigger altruistic desire), and perceives these %0a%3c two states as a single whole and as an advancement, despite the fact that in his %0a%3c sensations, a night designates remoteness from spirituality. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c from the Creator, and is therefore without joy, despite all the possible pleasures, %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c e language of spiritual work, this means that if man feels remi %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c for him thi %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c is called "night." I %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c sely %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Torah and Prayer %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 367 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c absence of sensation and lack of faith in the Creator that man can, through his %0a%3c own effort, without feeling any taste in the Torah, yield before the Creator's rule. %0a%3c That is, he closes his eyes (as one who goes to sleep) and says: "I bring myself %0a%3c under the Creator's rule and submit to His will." This state is called "descent %0a%3c for the sake of a subsequent ascent," and serves as a springboard, by which man %0a%3c attains an even brighter "day." %0a%3c %0a%3c However, to this end man must completely accept the Supernal Kingdom's %0a%3c rule, so that nothing will separate him from the Creator. In other words, he %0a%3c must submit to the Supernal Rule unconditionally, whether it brings life or %0a%3c death, so that no force in the world will be able to stop him from uniting with %0a%3c the Supernal Ruler, as it is written, "Love your Creator with all your heart, with %0a%3c all your soul and with all your might" (Devarim, 6:5). %0a%3c %0a%3c If man accepts everything that the Creator sends him with all his heart, he %0a%3c is certain that nothing will separate him from the Creator. This determines the %0a%3c fulfillment of the condition of entrusting one's soul with the Creator. For he %0a%3c gives himself into the Creator's hands in advance, by deciding to fulfill all His %0a%3c desires (commandments) to the fullest, right up to self-sacrifice. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, as man sleeps, when his soul (the sensation of the Creator), the %0a%3c *ht that previously filled him, leaves his body (desires), he does not feel the %0a%3c th part of death, for the impure (egoistic) forces have no power %0a%3c ;r words, they do not separate him from the Creator. Rather, %0a%3c Is to feel the Creator temporarily. %0a%3c %0a%3c Thus, the impure forces cannot interrupt his spiritual work even in the state %0a%3c called "night," for his evening and morning are already as one day— the Creator's %0a%3c Light. The night becomes a part of the day, for it is precisely because of the night %0a%3c that he recognizes his future merit of receiving an even greater Light. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is because his night stems not from the rule of the impure forces. %0a%3c Instead, he understands that the Creator intentionally sends him such states, %0a%3c hus, even in such sensations as darkness and lack of feeling, absence %0a%3c and taste for the spiritual, he sees an opportunity to merge witl %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 183. And in the morning, when he rises from his bed, he must bless the %0a%3c Creator, enter His house, and bow before Him in fear and trepidation, and %0a%3c only then should he pray. He should take advice of his holy Patriarchs, as it is %0a%3c written, "By Your great mercy shall I come into Your house, to bow in fear of %0a%3c Your holy greatness." %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 368 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Thanks to Your great kindness, I can now bless You for being merciful to %0a%3c me, for ending my spiritual descent, and for letting me come into Your house %0a%3c once more, for allowing me to feel You. However, I am happy not because my %0a%3c suffering gave way to pleasure, but because now I can thank You. I come to Your %0a%3c house so as to kneel in awe before Your holy greatness, which I now attain more %0a%3c than ever before. %0a%3c %0a%3c The prayer in our heart is the correction within Malchut (the Shechina, the %0a%3c sensation of the Creator, or the common soul of Israel), and the fulfillment %0a%3c of this common soul with the Upper Light (the sensation of the Creator), in %0a%3c accordance with all of its corrected desires. Hence, all our pleas are expressed %0a%3c in plural form, for we pray not for our own soul, but for the common soul of %0a%3c Israel. Naturally, all that is present in the Shechina is subsequently present in %0a%3c every soul of Israel, and vice versa, all that the common soul of Israel lacks is %0a%3c also absent in each soul. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, before we start praying, we need to understand (feel) what is %0a%3c lacking in Malchut (the Shechina), to know what we need to correct in her and %0a%3c how we can fulfill her. Our heart, the center of our desires, is a part of this %0a%3c Malchut (the Shechina). All the generations of Israel are included in the common %0a%3c soul— the Shechina. However, we need not correct what has already been corrected %0a%3c by previous generations, but only what is left after those generations of souls. %0a%3c %0a%3c Our Patriarchs, the spiritual Partzufim called "Avraham, Yitzchakand Yaakov," %0a%3c also known as the Sefirot Hesed, Gevura, and Tifferet of Partzuf ZA de Atzilut, %0a%3c include the entire community of Israel, all the properties that subsequently %0a%3c manifest in the corrected Malchut, who, in her corrected state, is called "Israel." %0a%3c The Patriarchs designate the three spiritual roots of the 600,000 souls of Israel %0a%3c in all the generations. In other words, these are the three sources of desires born %0a%3c within man's part of Malchut for the purpose of his correction. %0a%3c %0a%3c All the good deeds, the reception and bestowal of Light carried out by %0a%3c the "community of Israel" (by Kabbalists) in all the generations, first trigger %0a%3c reception of the Upper Light by our holy Patriarchs (Sefirot de ZA), for all the %0a%3c Upper Light descends through them from Above downwards. From them, this %0a%3c Upper Light descends onto the "community of Israel," the righteous of that %0a%3c generation who exist with their properties in the worlds of BYA, and evoke the %0a%3c descent of this Light with their prayers. %0a%3c %0a%3c Such is the order of spiritual degrees: each branch can receive only through %0a%3c its root (the preceding, Higher Degree), but never independently. The main %0a%3c Light remains in the root, and only an insignificant part of it descends to the %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Torah and Prayer %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 369 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c branch that evokes it. Therefore, all the corrections completed in the community %0a%3c of Israel (the Shechina, the common soul) are stored and preserved in the souls %0a%3c of our holy Patriarchs. %0a%3c %0a%3c (The Light received in the corrected Kelim remains forever within them. %0a%3c Our description of the Light's exit and descent should be understood as a %0a%3c metaphor, for the Partzuf receives new empty desires that require correction, and %0a%3c the sensation of emptiness from the received empty desires is perceived as the %0a%3c Light's departure. Nevertheless, upon correcting these newly received desires, in %0a%3c them the Partzuf will receive an even greater Light than before). %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, the essence of our prayer lies in supplementing the Shechina with %0a%3c whatever it needs to achieve complete correction, after all the previous corrections %0a%3c that were performed in it by the past generations of Kabbalists. Hence, he who %0a%3c spiritually ascends must first make all the corrections that have already been %0a%3c performed in the Shechina, and only then will he be able to recognize what is left %0a%3c for him to correct. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is why it is written that one cannot enter the Beit Knesset (synagogue, %0a%3c but in Hebrew it means "the house of assembly" or "the house of prayer," from %0a%3c the word Kones— "to assemble") before he assembles his prayer and asks the holy %0a%3c Patriarchs for guidance, for he needs to know what has already been corrected %0a%3c and what still needs to be corrected. This is possible only after he receives %0a%3c everything that the Patriarchs have corrected through the Shechina. Only then %0a%3c will he come to know what is left for him to correct in the Shechina. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Patriarchs have corrected the prayer in the Shechina. Prayer and the %0a%3c Shechina are one and the same, for prayer is a request, a raising of MAN, a Kli, the %0a%3c corrected Malchut or the desire for the Creator's sake. The correction performed %0a%3c by Avraham is called Shacharit (the morning prayer), by Yitzchak— Mincha (the %0a%3c afternoon prayer), and by Yaakov— Arvit (the evening prayer). Therefore, one %0a%3c must first repeat in his prayer everything that was already corrected by them, %0a%3c and then he will discover how to construct his personal plea, and what other %0a%3c imperfections are left that only he can, and consequently, must correct. %0a%3c %0a%3c 184. Man cannot enter the Beit Knesset (synagogue, house of prayer) unless %0a%3c he first receives permission from Avraham, Yitzchak and Yaakov, for they %0a%3c have corrected the prayer to the Creator. It is therefore written, "And in Your %0a%3c great mercy shall I enter into Your house" (Tehilim, 5:8). The aforesaid refers %0a%3c to Avraham, for his property is mercy, the Sefira Hesed. "I will bow before %0a%3c Your holy chamber" refers to Yitzchak, for thanks to him Malchut is called %0a%3c Heichal— chamber, the Sefira Qevura. "In fear and trepidation" refers to %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 370 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Yaakov, for his property is the Sefira Tifferet, called "fear." And man must %0a%3c first enter into these properties, and only then enter the Beit Knesset to raise %0a%3c his prayers. Such a state is described by the verse, "Here is My slave, Israel, by %0a%3c whom I am adorned." %0a%3c %0a%3c Here The Zohar analyzes the first three main corrections, made by the %0a%3c Patriarchs in the Shechina. Avraham corrected the property called Bait (house, %0a%3c permanent dwelling), which allows man to merge with it and to always exist in %0a%3c the Creator's properties and sensations, just as he can always dwell in his house. %0a%3c %0a%3c Yitzchak complemented the correction and corrected Maichut in the %0a%3c property called the "holy temple," so that the King Himself would always dwell %0a%3c in it, as a king always dwells in his chambers. Yaakov added to the correction %0a%3c by the property of fear, which corresponds to a gate in front of a house, and %0a%3c designates the condition that (if met) allows man to enter Maichut, Avraham's %0a%3c house, and into Yitzchak's holy temple that are both within her. %0a%3c %0a%3c Upon including within him all three corrections of the Patriarchs in full %0a%3c perfection, he attains what has already been corrected in the holy Shechina, and %0a%3c then proceeds to correct what has not been corrected. %0a%3c %0a%3c Avraham is the source of the property of mercy in the souls of Israel. %0a%3c Therefore, he corrected the holy Shechina in such a way that it could receive %0a%3c Ohr Hassadim, the Light of Mercy. And the Shechina received this Light in its %0a%3c entirety for all the souls of Israel. Had it remained this way, all the souls of %0a%3c Israel would have been in complete and eternal unity with the Creator, and %0a%3c the Shechina would have been filled with Light (pleasure). Thus, no man would %0a%3c ever wish to part with the Shechina (the sensation of the Creator) even for a %0a%3c single moment. %0a%3c %0a%3c Yet, Avraham's entire correction consisted in the creation of a perfect, %0a%3c bestowing Kli, which consisted only of Ohr Hassadim. There was no way of %0a%3c corrupting its properties or introducing imperfection within it, for, just like %0a%3c Avraham's property of mercy (Hesed), this Kli (desire) consisted only of the will %0a%3c to bestow upon, and please the Creator, as it is written: "Mine is yours and yours %0a%3c is yours designates the property of mercy" (Avot, 85). By imparting creation with %0a%3c his property, Avraham completely separated the impure forces (thoughts and %0a%3c desires) from the Shechina, and made it completely holy and pure. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, the Thought of Creation does not end here, for it lies in fulfilling %0a%3c the souls with delight. And the extent of pleasure depends on the aspiration to %0a%3c enjoy, on the degree of hunger. Only the extent of preliminary hunger, the will to %0a%3c receive pleasure, determines the extent of the subsequent reception of pleasure. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Torah and Prayer %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 371 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Shechina (Malchut de Atzilut, the sum of the souls) received its correction %0a%3c from Avraham— the Supernal force of Hassadim, the Sefira Hesed of ZA de Atzilut— %0a%3c and acquired the property of mercy from it. This property is completely free %0a%3c from any selfish will to receive, that is, its desire to receive something from the %0a%3c Creator has completely disappeared, and only the will to bestow upon Him %0a%3c remains. This desire is called "bestowal for the sake of bestowal." However, this %0a%3c brought no correction to the souls (parts of the Shechina), for their role is to %0a%3c receive the pleasure prepared for them by the Creator. To that end, they must %0a%3c first have the "will to receive." After all, pleasure is felt only when preceded by %0a%3c an aspiration or desire for it, and is determined by the extent of this desire. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is hence written that Avraham fathered Yitzchak: Yitzchak found the %0a%3c Shechina in absolute spiritual perfection, in the property of pure selfless bestowal, %0a%3c filled with Ohr Hassadim because of all the corrections made by Avraham. %0a%3c However, in accordance with his properties, Yitzchak (the left spiritual force) %0a%3c felt imperfection in this state of the Shechina— that it was not yet corrected to %0a%3c "receive" all that was conceived in the Thought of Creation. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, he corrected it by turning it into a Kli (vessel) of reception, %0a%3c by supplementing it with the will "to receive," so that it could receive all the %0a%3c perfection prepared for it. Yitzchak evoked in the Shechina the will to receive %0a%3c pleasure from the Creator, albeit in the form of "reception for the Creator's %0a%3c sake"— with the intention of receiving pleasure in order to delight Him. %0a%3c %0a%3c The reception for the Creator's sake means that although man fervently %0a%3c wishes to receive pleasure, he receives not because he wishes to enjoy, but only %0a%3c because the bestowing Creator wishes for him to receive it. And had the Creator %0a%3c not wished it so, man would have no desire to receive from Him. %0a%3c %0a%3c Reception for the Creator's sake is equivalent to selfless bestowal. Thus, the %0a%3c egoistic, impure force, cannot cling to such a desire. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, Yitzchak corrected the Shechina and brought it to complete perfection, %0a%3c for now it can receive all that the Creator conceived to bestow upon it, as this is %0a%3c the purpose of His creation. %0a%3c %0a%3c Thus, after being corrected by Yitzchak, the state of Malchut-Shechina is %0a%3c called Heichal (the Creator's chambers), for now He can fill it with Himself, His %0a%3c Light, which means that He dwells in its halls. %0a%3c %0a%3c Yet, Avraham's correction, called "house," did not yet allow the Shechina to %0a%3c be filled and worthy of the Creator's presence. Hence, Yitzchak is considered %0a%3c to have corrected all the Gevurot (willpower and resistance to egoism in the %0a%3c souls of Israel). This means that he mitigated all the laws and restrictions in the %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 372 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Creator's governance. This is because all restrictions and punishments come into %0a%3c this world for the sole purpose of correcting the souls' will to receive, to make %0a%3c them suitable for reception of the infinite goodness contained in the Thought %0a%3c of Creation. And since Yitzchak corrected the Shechina to complete perfection, %0a%3c all its restrictions and forces have been corrected, and all of its properties have %0a%3c attained the desired goal. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, his correction, too, did not retain this form in the Shechina, and %0a%3c became corrupted, for the world was still unprepared for the end of correction. %0a%3c Hence, Yitzchak fathered a sinner, Esav, who, being unable to resist the temptation %0a%3c to receive for himself, corrupted Yitzchak's correction in the Shechina. Unlike %0a%3c Yitzchak, he could not resist the selfish reception. This means that even when it %0a%3c became clear to him that the bestowing Creator did not wish for him to receive, %0a%3c he wanted to receive nonetheless, for such was his desire of self-gratification. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, the impure force (Klipot-shells, the husk, or rind surrounding %0a%3c the pure forces) clung to the Shechina. Thus, the legs (Sefirot NHYM) of Partzuf %0a%3c Malchut de Atzilut descended to the place of the Klipot below Parsa, where egoistic %0a%3c desires dominate the desires of NHYM. %0a%3c %0a%3c Yet, the Rosh and the Upper Part of the Guf down to the Tabur of Partzuf %0a%3c Malchut remained above the rule of the impure forces. Hence, his head (Rosh) %0a%3c understands how he should act (hence, Yitzchak's head is buried together with %0a%3c the bodies of Avraham and Yaakov in the Machpela cave), but the body (Guf) still %0a%3c wants to receive pleasure for its own sake. %0a%3c %0a%3c And since Yaakov saw the damage caused by Esav, he corrected the Shechina %0a%3c by adding his property of fear to it, as it is written: "His hand had hold on Esav's %0a%3c heel" (The Torah, Beresheet, 25:26). Because Yaakov realized what imperfection %0a%3c Esav had caused in Shechina (in the created souls), he corrected himself in fear %0a%3c to such an extent that he raised the holy Shechina as a crown-adornment. By this %0a%3c he also retained the corrections made by Avraham and Yitzchak. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, Yaakov's correction was not final, for this fear is more similar to %0a%3c the fear of transgression than the selfless fear that comes from within. For this %0a%3c fear of his is born in him from Esav's hip, even though he had not transgressed %0a%3c by receiving, as did Esav. But the end of correction will bring a different state: %0a%3c Esav's hip will be annulled, as it is written: "Death will forever vanish from the %0a%3c world," and fear will remain only because the Creator is almighty and great. %0a%3c %0a%3c Yaakov attained this genuine fear by himself. However, the entire "community %0a%3c of Israel," all the souls that form the Shechina, still need to correct themselves %0a%3c in all the generations, from the first to the last, to the end of correction. (Only %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Torah and Prayer %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 373 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Moshe attained the property of true fear— one out of greatness and love— only %0a%3c he, and no one else. Hence, as the Talmud says, description of fear out of love %0a%3c for the Creator doesn't even exist.) %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar cites the words of the Psalm (5:8): "By Your great mercy I shall %0a%3c come into Your house," since Avraham corrected the Shechina up to the property %0a%3c of a "house" that is filled with goodness, i.e., with Ohr Hassadim. The words, %0a%3c "So as to bow before Your holy chamber," refer to Yitzchak, who corrected the %0a%3c Shechina from a "house" to a "chamber" that befits the Creator. The words, %0a%3c "in fear" refer to Yaakov, who corrected the Shechina with his property of fear, %0a%3c whereupon he made it a Kli (vessel) of reception that includes all the corrections %0a%3c made by Avraham and Yitzchak. %0a%3c %0a%3c Yet, how did he find out what else needed correction in the Shechina! Only %0a%3c by correcting and including himself in these three corrections performed by the %0a%3c holy Patriarchs before him. This means that, just as they did, Yaakov can act %0a%3c according to the conditions of these corrections. In other words, Yaakov merged %0a%3c with their properties, thereby ascending to their level. %0a%3c %0a%3c Thus, man must first attain these properties and correct them within him. %0a%3c Only after he assumes the properties of these three corrections into himself can %0a%3c he start correcting them from where our Patriarch Yaakov left off, i.e., elevating %0a%3c fear to the extent of the Creator's greatness and omnipotence, and drawing the %0a%3c Upper Light with his prayer, with his awe of the Creator's greatness. And the %0a%3c Upper Light will bring with it the fulfillment of the Shechina and the end of %0a%3c its correction. Hence, man's prayer must include two objectives: to obtain fear %0a%3c of the Creator's true greatness, and with this attainment, to achieve the final %0a%3c correction of his egoism. %0a\ No newline at end of file%0a
