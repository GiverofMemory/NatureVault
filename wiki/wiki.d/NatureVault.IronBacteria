csum=Iron Bacteria are bacteria that oxidize iron and are typically found in northern latitude wells.  They are not thought to cause human disease however [[hemochromatosis]] mutation in the HFE gene arose 6,000 years ago and mostly in northern and wet areas.  This means these Iron Bacteria might have been involved in the genetic engineering of humans.  One of the most common iron bacteria is [[Thiobacillus]] [[https://www.garreltswater.com/water-quality/iron-bacteria/|#]] which are related to [[pseudomonas]] [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiobacillus|#]].  Also I noticed living in upstate new york drinking from a shallow well, [[pseudomonas]] symptoms of the feeling of "crawling in my skin".  Therefore I hypothesize that pseudomonas is involved in the [[hemochromatosis]] mutation.  [[Siderophilic bacteria]] are also common human pathogens and could definitly be linked to the development of hemochromatosis mutation.
