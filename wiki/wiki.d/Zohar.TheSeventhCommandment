text=The Seventh Commandment %0a%0a%0a%0a223. The seventh Mitzva is to perform circumcision on the eighth day, and thus %0aremove the impurity of the foreskin, for Malchut constitutes the eighth degree %0aof all the degrees, beginning with Bina. And the soul that soars from her must %0aappear before her on the eighth day; hence, she constitutes the eighth degree. %0a%0aNukva de ZA is called Haya if she rises and clothes Ima-Bina, the eighth %0adegree from Malchut (provided that you count all ten Sefirot from below upwards). %0aMalchut is hence called "the eighth," for she ascended eight degrees, from her %0aown place to that of Bina. And when she reaches Bina, she receives the name %0aHaya, just like Bina. %0a%0aTherefore, man's soul, which is born in Malchut (that ascended to Bina), %0amust appear before Malchut in all the appropriate corrections of circumcision, %0aremoval of the foreskin and the rolling up of its remains, on the eighth day from %0aits birth in Malchut. This is because then it becomes clear that it is a soul that %0awas born from none other than the holy degree of Haya. %0a%0aBecause of the force of circumcision and rolling up, man's soul sloughs the %0aimpure force, and the soul can receive the perfection of Ohr Haya. LET THE %0aWATERS SWARM— thus Malchut receives the Supernal male waters from ZON, %0aand is filled with them. %0a%0a224. It then becomes clear that the type of this soul is Haya. That is, belonging %0ato that holy degree of Haya (Malchut), and not to any other degree. And this %0ais implied by, LET THE WATERS SWARM, as is explained in the book of %0aHanoch, the waters of the holy seed merge in the properties of the soul of %0aHaya. And it is the property of the letter Yod, marked on the sacred flesh, %0amore than any other mark that exists in the world. %0a%0aBecause of the circumcision, the Supernal male waters fill man's soul the %0away they were received in Nukva (called "the soul of Haya"). The Upper World, %0a%0a415 %0a%0a%0a%0a416 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0acalled Bina, is designated by the letter Yod, and the lower world, Malchut, is %0adesignated by the letter Hey— its property. However, as Malchut ascends to Bina, %0athe letter Hey disappears from her, and, just like Bina, turns into Yod. %0a%0aSimilarly, through man's observance of the Mitzva of spiritual circumcision, %0athe letter Hey disappears, and just like in the Nukva that ascended to Bina, the %0aproperty of the letter Yod appears in him instead. And if man's body acquires the %0aproperty of Yod, he can receive the soul of Haya from Nukva. %0a%0a225. The verse, LET BIRDS SOAR OVER THE EARTH, refers to Eliyahu, %0awho flies across the whole world in four flights in order to be present in the %0aplace, where the Holy Covenant is made. And a chair must be prepared for %0ahim, and it must be said out loud, THIS IS THE CHAIR OF ELIYAHU. For %0athis is not done so, he will not appear in that place. %0a%0aAngels originate from AVI; hence, they remain exclusively in the sky and %0aconsist of HGT NHY Therefore, when they appear in this world to fulfill their %0atasks, they are said to make six flights, for they clothe in six Sefirot. %0a%0aHowever, Eliyahu stems from Malchut (not from AVI). Hence, he is %0aconstantly connected to the earth. And since Malchut contains only four Sefirot %0aof ZA, for her position is parallel to the Sefirot TNHY (Tifferet-Netzah-Hod-Yesod, %0apronounced, Tanhi) from Chazeh de ZA downward, it is written that Eliyahu %0aflies on four flights, i.e., by clothing in Sefirot TNHY. %0a%0aUnder no circumstances should one interpret the words about Eliyahu's %0apresence at every rite of circumcision literally. Yet, if he is obliged to be there, %0awhy should he be invited? %0a%0aThe Zohar explains this in another place (Shlach, 18): there are four impure %0aforces, called "Stormy Wind," "Great Cloud," "Blazing Flame," and Noga. The %0alowest of them, Stormy Wind, is at the center, as though clothed by Great %0aCloud, which is in turn clothed by Blazing Flame. And they are all clothed from %0athe outside by Noga. %0a%0aAll the worlds, forces, and everything that was ever created exists within man. %0aAnd these are our spiritual forces, by which we can attain the goal of creation. %0aThe first three impure forces are completely impure (egoistic). Whereas ~Noga is %0ahalf good and half evil. But how is that possible if the spiritual is always true? %0aHow can it be half good (altruistic) and half evil (egoistic) at the same time? %0a%0aIn fact, this is impossible. Noga is a neutral force that can be used by the %0apure force (then Noga is considered good) or by the impure force (and then it %0ais considered evil). Hence, Noga is called "half good and half evil" although %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Seventh Commandment %0a%0a%0a%0a417 %0a%0a%0a%0aneutral in itself. It may be attached to either pure or impure forces, and this %0adepends entirely on man. %0a%0aMAN'S SPIRITUAL FORCES %0aPure - altruistic %0a%0aNoga - neutral %0a%0aBlazing Flame - egoistic %0aGreat Cloud - egoistic %0aStormy Wind - egoistic %0a%0aThese four impure forces are located at the end of each spiritual Partzuf, in %0aits Sefira Yesod. The Sefira Yesod has two layers of skin, one atop of the other. One %0alayer is called Orla, and contains the three impure forces. The other is called %0aPreia, and this is Noga. %0a%0aThe first man, Adam, was born circumcised, meaning that he did not %0ahave the three impure forces at all— he was completely unaware of his egoistic %0adesires. In other words, they could not cling to him. Noga prevailed in him, %0ain his sensations. Yet, since it was separated from the three impure forces and %0aattached to the pure force (Adam's altruistic desires), Noga itself was considered %0acompletely good. %0a%0aThe three impure forces are collectively called the Serpent. These three %0aimpure desires were roused in Adam and tempted him to use them. In so doing, %0aAdam attracted the Orla to himself, as it is described in the Talmud (Sanhedrin, %0a38:2). As soon as he attached Orla to himself, his pure soul (the Light of the %0aworld of Atzilut) immediately disappeared, for his desires became egoistic, and %0ahe fell with his properties (desires) to the world of Assiya, to its lowest degree, %0acalled "this world," and was condemned to death (disappearance of the Supernal %0aspiritual Light). %0a%0aTherefore, it is written about him that since he violated the prohibition of %0anot eating the fruits of the Tree of Knowledge, he attached the Orla to himself. %0aConsequently, the impure desires acquired both layers of skin on the Sefira %0aYesod of Partzuf Adam, and Preia, called Noga, became impure, too, because %0aof its contact with the Orla, with the three impure forces. However, there is a %0adistinction between them, which lies in the fact that prior to Adam's sin, Preia %0awas pure, and all of its impurity stems from its contact with the Orla. %0a%0aAccordingly, there are two types of correction: circumcision and rolling up %0aof the remaining skin. The Orla must be cut off and cast in the dust, since only %0athus can man free himself from these egoistic desires. Preia, however, can be left %0a%0a%0a%0a418 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aattached to Yesod. But the skin around the Sefira Yesod must be rolled up. This %0ais a special spiritual action that frees the Preia from the impure forces remaining %0ain it. Hence, this action causes the Light to return to the Partzuf. This Light %0apreviously disappeared because of the egoistic desires that ruled in the Partzuf %0abefore the spiritual circumcision took place. %0a%0aHowever, this is still insufficient for the fulfillment of the spiritual Partzuf, %0aAdam, with the Light, as it was before he sinned, i.e. used the Serpent's impure %0aforces and tasted the forbidden fruit from the Tree of Knowledge (received Ohr %0aHochma in egoistic desires). For now, after Adam's sin and fall, a special angel by %0athe name of SAM makes accusations and complaints against man. %0a%0aTo neutralize the power of SAM, Eliyahu took upon himself his role of a %0aprosecutor, and was thereby granted an opportunity to defend Israel (one who %0aaspires to the Creator) when he circumcises himself (his egoistic desires). %0a%0aHence, it is said that Eliyahu must be present at each rite of circumcision %0a(Hebrew, Brit Mila— the Covenant with the Creator). For since it is he, rather than %0aSAM, who complains to the Creator about Israel's neglect of their Covenant, he %0acan also testify that when Israel aspires to the Creator, it is loyal to the covenant. %0aAs a result, the Light returns to the Partzuf. %0a%0aThis is why, besides the chair occupied by the man who holds the baby %0a(Sanda/c-godfather), one more chair must be prepared for the prophet Eliyahu. %0aFor the chair designates the beginning of correction, the influence of the Upper %0aOne on the lower one. The first chair, on which the Sandak sits, belongs to %0athe Creator, for the filling of Light as the result of the circumcision and the %0arolling up of the impure forces. The second chair is saved for Eliyahu, so he can %0aneutralize the impure forces' complaints to the Creator against man, so they %0awould not be able to accuse man. %0a%0aHowever, to make Eliyahu appear, one must say out loud: THIS IS THE %0aCHAIR OF ELIYAHU. The thing is that a male baby is circumcised on the %0aeighth day after Shabbat (Malchut with the Light of AVI, called "holy") has passed %0aover him. Since the sloughed desires (Orla) are cast away, the impure force sees %0athat it is given a part of the Creator's Covenant. Because of this gift, it stops %0acomplaining and accusing man. On the contrary, it begins to advocate him %0abefore the Creator. %0a%0aThe spiritual desires (objects) pass their properties from one to another. %0aSince the Orla was attached to Yesod, after the circumcision (separation from %0aYesod) it takes part of the pure desires with it. And since we throw it to the dust, %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Seventh Commandment %0a%0a%0a%0a419 %0a%0a%0a%0ato the impure forces, they draw from it that weak Light, which they can receive %0afrom the circumcision and the rolling up. %0a%0aThis is why the impure forces stop complaining against Israel, and no longer %0awish to destroy this Light, for in so doing they will lose the part that they draw %0afrom it. Thus, they become defenders of the pure forces, to allow the pure forces %0ato be filled with Light. %0a%0aYet, Eliyahu cannot bear this correction, for although the Klipa stops %0aimpeding and slandering Israel, it takes part of the Light for itself in return. To %0acorrect this, Eliyahu takes upon himself all the accusations against Israel, and %0arefuses to give anything from the pure to the impure forces. %0a%0aThus, although the impure force stopped complaining against Israel, and %0aactually became its defender, Eliyahu himself continues to accuse in order to %0awrest all the power from the impure forces and fully separate them from the %0apure. Hence, a chair must be prepared for Eliyahu, for it is he who fully separates %0athe impure forces from the pure ones. %0a%0aOne must therefore verbalize the words: THIS IS THE CHAIR OF %0aELIYAHU. For after the circumcision, part of the Light still remains in the %0aimpure forces, and the mention of Eliyahu completely deprives them of any %0acontact with the Light. %0a%0aThus, if man does not express his desire to detach himself completely from %0athe impure forces, through his own effort (by the screen positioned in Peh), it %0adoes not happen, even though the first chair belongs to the Creator. This is %0abecause the Creator starts the process of creation (makes His foundation in %0athe form of a chair), and man continues and corrects his nature by performing %0aaltruistic deeds. %0a%0a226. And the Creator created great Leviathans. They were two: Orla and %0aPreia, male and female forces, and all living creatures. This is the mark of %0athe Holy Covenant, the soul of the holy Ohr Haya, as it is written, LET THE %0aWATERS SWARM, the Supernal Waters that descend to this Covenant. %0a%0aLeviathan and his wife designate that which is opposite from Orla and Preia. %0aThey are also called Nachash (Serpent) and Alcaton (his wife). Orla is the Serpent, %0aand Nachash is the male part that must be cut off and committed to dust. Preia %0ais the correction, liberation from the Serpent's female part, Alcaton. Through %0athese corrections, Ohr Haya of AVI descends from Above. %0a%0a227. The reason why Israel below is marked in the holy form, similar to its %0aform from Above, is to separate the pure part from the impure, to distinguish %0a%0a%0a%0a420 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0abetween the holiness of Israel and the other nations that originate from the %0aother side. And just as Israel was marked, so were the animals and birds— to %0adetermine which of them belong to Israel, and which belong to the nations of %0athe world. Happy is the lot of Israel! %0a%0aMan's attitude toward all the living creatures in our world is similar to the %0aattitude of the general spiritual creation, called "man," toward his parts. This %0ais because Adam includes absolutely everything within his spiritual body. And %0ae is nothing except for this spiritual Partzuf, called "man" or "Adam." %0a%0a1 spiritual objects, angels, souls, both pure and impure forces are part %0a's body. All that is described in Kabbalah speaks only of the spirit %0aworld, of one creature called "man," Adam. Adam's various parts, his varic %0adesires— are called "Israe %0aanimals," and so forth. %0a%0aAll that man must do in our world (for every one of us was created in the %0aimage of Adam, recreating Adam's entire Partzuf within him) is build a pure, %0aruistic Partzuf within him. This is done by cutting off all of the egoistic desires %0aarating the pure from the impure in all his desires,

The seventh Mitzva is to perform circumcision on the eighth day, and thus %0a%3c remove the impurity of the foreskin, for Malchut constitutes the eighth degree %0a%3c of all the degrees, beginning with Bina.

The verse, LET BIRDS SOAR OVER THE EARTH, refers to Eliyahu, %0a%3c who flies across the whole world in four flights in order to be present in the %0a%3c place, where the Holy Covenant is made.

Noga is a neutral force that can be used by the %0a%3c pure force (then Noga is considered good) or by the impure force (and then it %0a%3c is considered evil).

It may be attached to either pure or impure forces, and this %0a%3c depends entirely on man. %0a%3c %0a%3c MAN'S SPIRITUAL FORCES %0a%3c Pure - altruistic %0a%3c %0a%3c Noga - neutral %0a%3c %0a%3c Blazing Flame - egoistic %0a%3c Great Cloud - egoistic %0a%3c Stormy Wind - egoistic %0a%3c %0a%3c These four impure forces are located at the end of each spiritual Partzuf, in %0a%3c its Sefira Yesod. The Sefira Yesod has two layers of skin, one atop of the other. One %0a%3c layer is called Orla, and contains the three impure forces. The other is called %0a%3c Preia, and this is Noga. %0a%3c %0a%3c The first man, Adam, was born circumcised, meaning that he did not %0a%3c have the three impure forces at all— he was completely unaware of his egoistic %0a%3c desires. In other words, they could not cling to him. Noga prevailed in him, %0a%3c in his sensations. Yet, since it was separated from the three impure forces and %0a%3c attached to the pure force (Adam's altruistic desires), Noga itself was considered %0a%3c completely good. %0a%3c %0a%3c The three impure forces are collectively called the Serpent. These three %0a%3c impure desires were roused in Adam and tempted him to use them. In so doing, %0a%3c Adam attracted the Orla to himself, as it is described in the Talmud (Sanhedrin, %0a%3c 38:2).

Preia, however, can be left %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 418 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c attached to Yesod. But the skin around the Sefira Yesod must be rolled up. This %0a%3c is a special spiritual action that frees the Preia from the impure forces remaining %0a%3c in it. Hence, this action causes the Light to return to the Partzuf. This Light %0a%3c previously disappeared because of the egoistic desires that ruled in the Partzuf %0a%3c before the spiritual circumcision took place. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, this is still insufficient for the fulfillment of the spiritual Partzuf, %0a%3c Adam, with the Light, as it was before he sinned, i.e. used the Serpent's impure %0a%3c forces and tasted the forbidden fruit from the Tree of Knowledge (received Ohr %0a%3c Hochma in egoistic desires). For now, after Adam's sin and fall, a special angel by %0a%3c the name of SAM makes accusations and complaints against man. %0a%3c %0a%3c To neutralize the power of SAM, Eliyahu took upon himself his role of a %0a%3c prosecutor, and was thereby granted an opportunity to defend Israel (one who %0a%3c aspires to the Creator) when he circumcises himself (his egoistic desires). %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, it is said that Eliyahu must be present at each rite of circumcision %0a%3c (Hebrew, Brit Mila— the Covenant with the Creator).

The thing is that a male baby is circumcised on the %0a%3c eighth day after Shabbat (Malchut with the Light of AVI, called "holy") has passed %0a%3c over him. Since the sloughed desires (Orla) are cast away, the impure force sees %0a%3c that it is given a part of the Creator's Covenant. Because of this gift, it stops %0a%3c complaining and accusing man. On the contrary, it begins to advocate him %0a%3c before the Creator. %0a%3c %0a%3c The spiritual desires (objects) pass their properties from one to another. %0a%3c Since the Orla was attached to Yesod, after the circumcision (separation from %0a%3c Yesod) it takes part of the pure desires with it. And since we throw it to the dust, %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Seventh Commandment %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 419 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c to the impure forces, they draw from it that weak Light, which they can receive %0a%3c from the circumcision and the rolling up. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is why the impure forces stop complaining against Israel, and no longer %0a%3c wish to destroy this Light, for in so doing they will lose the part that they draw %0a%3c from it. Thus, they become defenders of the pure forces, to allow the pure forces %0a%3c to be filled with Light. %0a%3c %0a%3c Yet, Eliyahu cannot bear this correction, for although the Klipa stops %0a%3c impeding and slandering Israel, it takes part of the Light for itself in return. To %0a%3c correct this, Eliyahu takes upon himself all the accusations against Israel, and %0a%3c refuses to give anything from the pure to the impure forces. %0a%3c %0a%3c Thus, although the impure force stopped complaining against Israel, and %0a%3c actually became its defender, Eliyahu himself continues to accuse in order to %0a%3c wrest all the power from the impure forces and fully separate them from the %0a%3c pure. Hence, a chair must be prepared for Eliyahu, for it is he who fully separates %0a%3c the impure forces from the pure ones. %0a%3c %0a%3c One must therefore verbalize the words: THIS IS THE CHAIR OF %0a%3c ELIYAHU. For after the circumcision, part of the Light still remains in the %0a%3c impure forces, and the mention of Eliyahu completely deprives them of any %0a%3c contact with the Light. %0a%3c %0a%3c Thus, if man does not express his desire to detach himself completely from %0a%3c the impure forces, through his own effort (by the screen positioned in Peh), it %0a%3c does not happen, even though the first chair belongs to the Creator. This is %0a%3c because the Creator starts the process of creation (makes His foundation in %0a%3c the form of a chair), and man continues and corrects his nature by performing %0a%3c altruistic deeds. %0a%3c %0a%3c 226. And the Creator created great Leviathans. They were two: Orla and %0a%3c Preia, male and female forces, and all living creatures. This is the mark of %0a%3c the Holy Covenant, the soul of the holy Ohr Haya, as it is written, LET THE %0a%3c WATERS SWARM, the Supernal Waters that descend to this Covenant. %0a%3c %0a%3c Leviathan and his wife designate that which is opposite from Orla and Preia. %0a%3c They are also called Nachash (Serpent) and Alcaton (his wife). Orla is the Serpent, %0a%3c and Nachash is the male part that must be cut off and committed to dust. Preia %0a%3c is the correction, liberation from the Serpent's female part, Alcaton. Through %0a%3c these corrections, Ohr Haya of AVI descends from Above. %0a%3c %0a%3c 227. The reason why Israel below is marked in the holy form, similar to its %0a%3c form from Above, is to separate the pure part from the impure, to distinguish %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 420 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c between the holiness of Israel and the other nations that originate from the %0a%3c other side. And just as Israel was marked, so were the animals and birds— to %0a%3c determine which of them belong to Israel, and which belong to the nations of %0a%3c the world. Happy is the lot of Israel! %0a%3c %0a%3c Man's attitude toward all the living creatures in our world is similar to the %0a%3c attitude of the general spiritual creation, called "man," toward his parts. This %0a%3c is because Adam includes absolutely everything within his spiritual body. And %0a%3c e is nothing except for this spiritual Partzuf, called "man" or "Adam." %0a%3c %0a%3c 1 spiritual objects, angels, souls, both pure and impure forces are part %0a%3c 's body. All that is described in Kabbalah speaks only of the spirit %0a%3c world, of one creature called "man," Adam. Adam's various parts, his varic %0a%3c desires— are called "Israe %0a%3c animals," and so forth. %0a%3c %0a%3c All that man must do in our world (for every one of us was created in the %0a%3c image of Adam, recreating Adam's entire Partzuf within him) is build a pure, %0a%3c ruistic Partzuf within him. This is done by cutting off all of the egoistic desires %0a%3c arating the pure from the impure in all his desires, %0a\ No newline at end of file%0a
