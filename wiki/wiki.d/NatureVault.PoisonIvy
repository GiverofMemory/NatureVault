csum=Took [[jewelweed]] internally did not help.  Mashing the leaves and on the rashes help for 1-3 hours only.  Homeopathic name is Rhus Tox and it is known to treat symptoms [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W28OnGiZkpg|#]] that seem similar to [[Wuchereria]].  Homeopathic is ultra ditute but perhaps a tea made from a tiny bit of poison ivy leaf often might help the body fight worms.  The hot water in tea inactivates the urshinol that causes the allergic reaction too.
