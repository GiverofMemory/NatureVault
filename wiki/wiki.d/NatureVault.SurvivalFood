text=(:nogroupheader:)%0aSee also [[forage]]%0a%0aHere we rank the best survival foods judged based on:%0a%0a* All inclusive nutrition (how well a person would survive on this food alone).  This does not only mean a balance of nutrients, but other factors as well.%0a%0a* Ease of growing and harvesting and preparation.  Low maintanance crops, low overhead to growing, and easy to eat. Foods that can be eaten raw is a bonus. These reasons makes things like rice and wheat not ideal.  Those are crops of civilization, not survival.  [[Soup]] is the best and most common way to eat in a survival situation.%0a%0a* Storability.  You can't survive if your food goes bad.%0a%0a* Ease of propogation.  How easy is it to attain and keep this crop growing season after season.%0a\\%0a%0aI'm not worried about taste here.  I have seen some survival crop sites talk about "grow what you will eat".  I can tell these people have never been hungry or undernourished, because if you ever have been, you will know ''everything'' will taste amazing!  I didn't like to eat nuts but when I couldn't afford anything besides dry beans; nuts were a godsend.  So you will grow out of your "likes and dislikes" really fast when you are in survival mode.  Trust me.%0a\\%0a\\%0aInstead I am much more focused on "grow what you can manage".  Sure we would all want to have a thriving garden with every food group but in a survival situation you may not have access to seeds, even land of your own.  A stealth grow of what other people consider weeds might be your best bet.  Also we won't likely have much extra energy, insomnia is the real pandemic in the [[grand solar minimum]] and without supermarkets a lack of energy to get out of bed will be a real issue.  Plan to grow what you can manage, and that may only be one or two types of crop, and that is perfectly fine.  Anything from the following list can keep you alive.%0a\\%0a%0a!!!Here are the crops, ranked:%0a%0a# [[Lambs Quarters]]%0a%0a# [[Onion]]%0a%0a# [[Potato]]%0a%0a# [[Corn]]%0a%0a# [[Cabbage]]%0a%0a# [[Winter squash]]%0a%0a# [[Bean]]%0a%0a# [[Kale]]%0a%0aSpecial mention to [[earthworms]].%0a%0a!!Links%0aAnti-inflammatory foods [[https://www.naturalblaze.com/2021/01/eat-more-yellow-veggies-and-drink-coffee-to-zap-inflammation-heart-disease-risk.html|#]]%0a%0aStaple crops and survival [[https://www.naturalnews.com/2021-08-30-8-important-survival-lessons-from-antarctica.html|#]].%0a%0aMushrooms and seaweed to survive [[https://www.naturalnews.com/2021-09-06-mushrooms-seaweed-help-you-survive-post-shtf.html|#]] not a huge fan of mushrooms because of [[alfatoxin]] but eaten freshly picked certain types are ok.%0a%0amost nutritious garden weeds [[http://www.ecosnippets.com/gardening/the-five-healthiest-backyard-weeds/|#]] [[https://theselfsufficientliving.com/10-edible-weeds-that-have-rich-taste-and-nutritious-value/|#]] [[https://returntonow.net/2018/06/06/6-edible-weeds-that-are-more-nutritious-than-store-bought-veggies/|#]] [[https://defiel.com/edible-weeds/|#]] [[https://www.treehugger.com/eat-dandelions-edible-garden-weeds-4858806|#]]%0a%0aCardoon [[http://www.gardenology.org/wiki/Cardoon|#]]%0a%0aDavid the good, potatoes, cabbage etc [[https://www.naturalblaze.com/2022/01/survival-gardening-with-david-the-good-ice-age-farmer-broadcast-part-one.html|#]]
