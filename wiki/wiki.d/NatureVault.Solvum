text=See also [[electrosolvumdynamics]].%0a%0aSolvum is named after the Latin root solv- which means to loosen or freedom.  It was also chosen because it is related to "solvent" which is something we all know and use, and solvum are very often solvents, actually because of their solvum nature, so it fits.%0a%0aSolvum is a media or system that is composed of smaller parts (like molecules or atoms) that are mutually interactive with eachother.  We are familiar with these media, they include water, air, aether, and things like that.  It can be thought of as a "flow-state".  The smaller parts vibrate with added heat energy, they do not act in a [[newtonian]] way where they bounce from one side to another side.  They assume the lowest energy state at all times.  this is related to [[quantum]], mostly in an opposite way, depending on how the term quantum is used.  Solvum is refered to "reliqum" in this article [[https://www.naturehacker.org/2020/09/quantaclast-technology-compressing.html|#]]https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=naturehacker.org&.png%0a%0aIf there is a lower pressure of the media in one area, surrounding pieces will move to equalize the pressure for example.  A perfectly solvum media cannot be moved or pushed or otherwise provide a reactionary force.  Only by de-solvumizing the media locally can a reaction force be sustained by the solvum media.  "De-solvumizing" the media so it can sustain a greater reactionary force can be called "[[quantaclast]]" technology.

However realize the brownian motion experiment is done on the '''''surface''''' of the medium, at the interface of another medium.  Brownian motion has never been seen '''''inside''''' a medium where the medium is not interacting with another medium.  In reality, molecules in a medium like water do not zip from one side of the ocean to the other in straight lines, they rather stay in roughly the same location in a probability function, basically vibrating.
