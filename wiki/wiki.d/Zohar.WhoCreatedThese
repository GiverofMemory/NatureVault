text=Who Created These %0a%0a%0a%0a7. In the beginning, Rabbi Elazar opened, "Raise your eyes and you shall %0asee, WHO HAS CREATED THESE" (Xeshayahu, 40:26). Raise your eyes %0awhere? To the place on which all eyes depend. Who is He? He is the One who %0aopens eyes, Mcdchut de Rosh de Arich Anpin. And there you shall see that %0aAtik is concealed and within it lies the answer to the question: WHO HAS %0aCREATED THESE? WHO? MI, ZAT de Bina, the Highest Edge of Heaven, %0aand everything depends on Him. And since the question lies in Him, and He %0ais concealed, He is called MI. For MI is like when the question "Who?" is %0aasked, as there are no questions above Him. The question is found only at the %0aHighest Boundary of Heaven. %0a%0aIn the beginning, Rabbi Elazar opened, "Raise your eyes on high and look %0aat who has created these." Raise your eyes to what place? To the place, where %0aall eyes depend on Him. And who is He? He is the One who opens eyes. And %0athere you shall know. It is the concealed Atik, within which lies the question: %0awho has created these? And who is He? MI = who. He is called by the edge of the %0aSupernal Heaven, where everything belongs to him. Since there lies a question, %0aand He is on a concealed path and does not reveal Himself, He is called MI. %0aAnd because there is no question Above, this edge of Heaven is called MI. %0a%0aIn Hebrew, the word MI means the question "Who?" as well as the %0apreposition "from." Since Kabbalah tells us about the property of our world's %0aroots, one spiritual object can sometimes reveal an entire range of associations, %0aproperties, and categories. In the same way, here the word MI is a part of the %0aword EloklM, where the last two letters form the word MI. However, at the same %0atime, they carry a variety of additional charges and meanings. %0a%0aRabbi Elazar wishes to explain how Heaven and earth were created. %0aNaturally, just like the whole of the Torah, The Zohar refers only to spiritual %0adegrees and categories, and does not deal with explanations of the physical %0a%0a73 %0a%0a%0a%0a74 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aorigin and development of our world. Moreover, it is impossible to understand %0athe true origin and development of our world without attaining the spiritual %0aworld. However, whatever one does attain, he is unable to pass these attainments %0ato others. Hence, even after he attains the full essence of our nature's origin %0aand its actions, he will still be unable to describe it in a form that will be %0acomprehensible to others. %0a%0aHeaven and earth constitute the seven days of Creation— ZON of the %0aworld of Atzilut. However, if it is a part of Atzilut, then why is it described as %0aBARAH (created, from the word Beria) and not ATZIL (emanated, from the %0aword Atzilut) 7 . Yet, precisely herein lies the opportunity to open our eyes to the %0aprocess of creation. %0a%0aRosh (head) de AA has only Keter and Hochma. Malchut standing below the %0aeyes, below Sefira Hochma, is called "the opening of the eyes." After all, only %0awhen she opens up does the Light of Hochma pass through her from Rosh de AA %0ato all the Partzufim of the world of Atzilut. %0a%0aIt is therefore said that the eyes should be raised up TO THE PLACE %0aON WHICH ALL EYES DEPEND, for the Light of Hochma can fill all the %0aPartzufim of the world of Atzilut only when Malchut opens up in Rosh de AA. %0aHence, the entire secret of the opening lies in Malchut. The Light of Hochma %0a(the Light of Wisdom) is the Light of the eyes. It comes out of the eyes, and %0aonly in this Light can one see. %0a%0aThe word BARAH signifies BAR (beyond), meaning outside the world %0aof Atzilut. This is because Bina herself came out of the Rosh of AA and stood %0alower, outside the Rosh of AA, giving birth to, that is, precisely BARAH %0a(creating) ZON. %0a%0aIn Hebrew, every notion has several possible names that determine the %0aspecific action that takes place. Here, the birth of ZON occurred by means %0aof Bina's exit and descent from her degree; hence, the birth of ZON is called %0aBARAH, from the word BAR - outside (of one's degree). %0a%0aThe entire creation consists of only ten Sefirot. Yet, since every Sefira includes %0aall the others, and since all of them are interconnected, every world, degree, %0aor Sefira includes the properties of all the others, and consists of their parts. %0aTherefore, every Sefira consists of Keter, Hochma, Bina, ZA, and Malchut, each of %0awhich in turn consists of five. In all, 5x5x5 = 125 Sefirot or steps of the ladder %0athat separate us (the lowest) from the Creator (the highest). %0a%0aThe property of Bina herself is not to receive the Light of Hochma. Yet, in %0aorder to pass the Light of Hochma to ZA and Malchut, who desire to receive it for %0a%0a%0a%0aWho Created These %0a%0a%0a%0a75 %0a%0a%0a%0athe Creator's sake, since receiving the Light of Hochma is the goal of creation, %0aBina allocates within herself a certain part called ZAT de Bina or YESHSUT, %0awhich receives the Light of Hochma from Partzuf Hochma and passes it to ZON. %0aThe main part, Bina herself, is called GAR de Bina. The part of Bina that receives %0athe Light of Hochma is called ZAT de Bina. %0a%0aTherefore, if Bina exits the Rosh and falls into the Guf, as it occurs in the %0asecond restriction, this has no effect on Bina herself, for she does not suffer %0afrom lack of the Light of Hochma whatsoever, as though she had never left the %0aRosh. This refers only to the Upper part of Bina, GAR de Bina, which has no %0adesire for Hochma. This part is called AVI, and it spans from the Peh (mouth) %0adown to the Chazeh (chest) of AA. %0a%0aHowever, ZAT de Bina, which wants to receive Hochma for ZON, just as a %0amother who wants to receive for her children, feels the exit from the Rosh of AA %0ato its Guf, for there it cannot receive the Light of Hochma, but only the Light %0aof Ruach-Nefesh, VAK of the Light. This part of Bina is called YESHSUT, and it %0aspans from the Chazeh down to Tahur of AA. %0a%0aZON of the world of Atzilut, which receive from YESHSUT, span from Tahur %0ato the end of the feet of AA, on the Parsa. Thus, there are two Parsaot (plural for %0aParsa): one is in the world of Atzilut, separating the Sefirot of "bestowal" (GE) %0afrom the Sefirot of "reception" (AHP). This Parsa is located at the chest of AA. %0aThe second Parsa is located between Atzilut and BYA. However, we can also say %0athat every Partzuf has its own Parsa, which separates the desires of bestowal from %0athe desires of reception. %0a%0aAtik %0a%0a%0a%0aAA %0a%0a%0a%0aZON %0a%0a%0a%0aYESHSUT = ZAT de Bina %0a%0a%0a%0aAVI = GAR de Bina %0a%0a%0a%0aPehH %0a%0aRosh %0aPeh— I- Chazeh- %0a%0a%0a%0aChazeh %0a%0a%0a%0a■ Tabur %0aRaglaim %0a%0a%0a%0aRaglaim %0a%0a%0a%0aParsa %0a%0aof the World %0aof Atzilut %0a%0a%0a%0aParsa %0a%0a%0a%0aBeria %0a%0a%0a%0aYetzira %0a%0a%0a%0aAssiya %0a%0a%0a%0aThis World %0a%0a%0a%0aMachsom %0a%0a%0a%0a76 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aAlthough GAR de Bina are positioned below the Rosh of AA, they are %0aconsidered not to have left it, as they do not feel it, that is, they do not want %0aHochma; they wish only to bestow, and he who wants only to bestow feels %0aperfection wherever he is. All the Partzufim and their parts that have nothing %0ato do with reception of Hochma (Keter, Hochma, and GAR de Bina) separate %0athemselves with a Parsa from the remaining parts of the world of Atzilut that %0awant Hochma (ZAT de Bina and ZON). %0a%0aThe "existence of the question" that The Zohar speaks of signifies the %0asensation of the lack of Light of Hochma, the desire for it. This is felt by ZON, %0awhich is why they raise MAN. MAN is a request of the lower one to receive %0athe Light of Hochma from the Upper One for the Creator's sake. It is called %0aa "question," for a question is similar to prayer or request. The Zohar tells us %0athat the question exists only in YESHSUT, meaning that it receives MAN from %0abelow, from ZON. %0a%0aAnd before that, it is said of YESHSUT: BARAH (from the word Beria = BAR), %0asomething that exists outside of its degree. What did it do? BARAH (created) %0aELEH (AHP, ZON). However, it created them as headless as itself. For the word %0aBARAH (beyond) indicates the lack of a Rosh (Kelim of the world of Atzilut). %0a%0aZAT de Bina that wait for an "answer to their question," for the Light of %0aHochma, are called MI. It is said BARAH in regards to them because they exited %0aand descended independently from the level of the Rosh de AA to below its %0aChazeh. These are ZAT de Bina, called YESHSUT or MI, the "Highest Edge of %0aHeaven," for Heaven refers to ZA, who receives from YESHSUT. Malchut is %0acalled "earth." %0a%0aZAT de Bina is called "firmament." %0a%0aZA is called "Heaven." %0a%0aMalchut is called "earth." %0a%0aAll that exists below YESHSUT (ZON and the worlds of BYA) receives from %0ait. Hence, it is considered that YESHSUT revives the whole of creation: whatever %0ait has, they will receive it, too. However, their MAN determines whether or not %0aYESHSUT will have something to bestow upon them. %0a%0aTHERE LIES NO QUESTION in GAR de Bina (AVI). They do not receive %0aMAN for the reception of Hochma, and they never feel any lack of Hochma, %0aneither for themselves nor so as to give to others. Only ZATde Bina or YESHSUT %0aare created and exist for the question, for the reception of MAN (ZON's plea). %0aYESHSUT raises MAN that is received from ZON to the Rosh of AA and receives %0a%0a%0a%0aWho Created These %0a%0a%0a%0a77 %0a%0a%0a%0athe Light of Hochma from there. YESHSLT is called the "Highest Edge of %0aHeaven," for ZA, called "Heaven," receives from it. %0a%0a8. But there is another one below, called MA. What is in common between %0athis one and that one? The first one is concealed and is called MI. There exists %0aa question in it for man to inquire and research in order to see and know all %0athe degrees, down to the end of all degrees, which is Malchut. That is MA. %0aWhat does MA mean? MA (what) do you know? What do you see? What do %0ayou research? After all, everything is initially concealed. %0a%0aBeing in a state of Zivug PBP with ZA, Malchut is also called MA (like ZA) and %0ais considered the lowest edge of Heaven, for she concludes all the degrees and %0aAtzilut. ZA, called "Heaven," stands between Malchut (lowest edge of Heaven) %0aand YESHSLT (Highest Edge of Heaven). %0a%0aMAN MUST INQUIRE, SEE, RESEARCH-only if one who is below %0aZON raises MAN (his prayer) to ZON will they raise this MAN higher. For ZON %0athemselves are corrected by the Light of Hassadim, and do not want to receive %0athe Light of Hochma. And only if a request comes from below, from man, will %0aZON ascend to YESHSLT and ask for the Light of Hochma. YESHSLT proceeds %0ato raise MAN to AVI, and AVI raise MAN to AA: AVI ascend to the Rosh of AA, %0awhere there is the Light of Hochma, where they make a Zivug on this Light. %0a%0aA Zivug of AVI is called "Aha and Ima looking at each other." To "look" %0ameans to receive the Light of Hochma (to "hear" means to receive the Light of %0aHassadim). As a result of AVI's ascent to the Rosh of AA, Bina starts receiving %0aHochma for ZON. All the Partzufim of the world of Atzilut are corrected by the %0aLight of Hassadim in such a way that they do not want to receive the Light of %0aHochma for themselves. %0a%0aHe who is able to raise his request (MAN) to compel ZON to ascend to %0aYESHS LT, whereupon YESHS LT and AVI will ascend to the Rosh of AA together %0aso as to receive the Light for him— such a person is not simply considered a mere %0a"person," but a "righteous"! %0a%0aThe request that one raises to ZON is called one's "soul," for a soul is a %0avessel, a desire filled with Light. However, the Light inside a vessel is determinec %0aby the desire. Hence, the spiritual desire, the intention to act for the Creator's %0asake is called "a soul." Naturally, if one does not yet have such an intention, he %0aot have a soul. %0a%0aThe spiritual world is a world of only desires without any corporea %0ahells. The reader must revise his ideas about the soul, body, connections %0a%0a%0a%0a%0a78 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0a%0a>rlds, etc., and correct himself continually so as to properly in %0aategories. %0a%0a%0a%0a%0aSo then, man's corrected desires are called "the souls of the righteous." %0aThese souls of the righteous ascend to ZON in the form of MAN and compel %0aZON to ascend to YESHSUT. The presence of ZON creates in YESHSUT a %0adesire to receive the Light of Hochma. This compels YESHSUT (ZAT de Bina) to %0aascend to the Rosh of AA and there join with GAR de Bina (AVI) into one Partzuf. %0aAnd then AVI (AB + SAG = AA + AVI) look at each other, exchange the Light of %0aHochma between them, and pass it down to ZON. %0a%0aWithout a request from below, AVI will be satisfied with the Light of %0aHassadim and will not "look" at one another. Only the request of their children %0a(ZON) compels AVI to face each other (Panim be Panim) and make a Zivug. In %0athis Zivug, Ima-Bina receives the Light of Hochma for the children, ZON, from %0aAha-Hochma. %0a%0aHowever, this occurs BECAUSE MAN INQUIRED-man's question %0asignifies the raising of MAN so as to make AVI look at each other, make a Zivug %0atogether, and let Ima receive Hochma from Aha for the man that is elevating his %0asoul. The descending Light of Hochma is called knowledge or wisdom (Daat), %0afor ZON ascend to YESHSUT + AVI, and there stimulate a Zivug on the Light %0aof Hochma, called "knowledge." Hence, it is written in the Torah: "And Adam %0acame to know his wife." %0a%0aThus, to COME TO KNOW means to receive the Light of Hochma. ZON %0athat stand in AVI and compel AVI to receive the Light of Hochma are called Daat %0a(knowledge) or the Sefira Daat. %0a%0aYet, Daat is not an additional Sefira. There are only ten Sefirot. However, in %0aorder to designate the fact that ZON's request for the Light of Hochma is inside %0athe ten Sefirot of Partzuf AVI, we say that AVI have a Sefira called Daat. In this case, %0ainstead of the regular count of Sefirot: KHB-HGT-NHYM, we count the Sefirot: %0aHBD-HGT-NHYM. The Sefira Keter is omitted, and we only mention the Sefira %0aDaat after HochmaAba and Bina-lma. FROM ONE DEGREE TO ANOTHER %0asignifies the passing of the Light of Hochma from the Sefira Daat of the degree of %0aAVI to the degree of ZA. And TO THE END OF ALL DEGREES-from ZA to %0aMalchut, which is called "the end of all degrees." %0a%0aWhen the Light is present in Nukva, she is called MA, and the Light that she %0apasses to the lower ones is called 100 blessings. There are several states in Nukva, %0aMalchut of the world of At^ilut. We need to know them, for all that we receive, %0a%0a%0a%0aWho Created These %0a%0a%0a%0a79 %0a%0a%0a%0awe receive from her alone. In addition to all stages of growth from a point to a %0afull Partzuf, a grown Malchut has two big states. %0a%0aMalchut attains the first big state when she receives the Light of Neshama. %0aThis occurs when, due to her MAN, AVI ascend one degree from their %0apermanent place to the Rosh of AA. However, although YESHSUT ascends from %0aits permanent place between the chest (Chazeh) and the navel (Tabur) of AA to %0awhere AVI used to be (between the mouth and the chest of AA), it still remains %0aclothed onto the Guf of AA, even though it merges into one Partzuf with AVI. %0a%0aAnd since YESHSUT now clothes the place from the mouth (Peh) to the %0aChazeh of AA from the outside, YESHSUT becomes like the Rosh of AA, as it %0amerged with AVI in the Rosh of AA as one Partzuf. Also, YESHSUT ascends from %0aunder the Parsa of Atzilut in the Chazeh of AA and stands above it, where the %0aRosh of AA shines. %0a%0aThat is why YESHSUT passes the Light of Hochma to ZA, and ZA passes %0ait on to Malchut, who fills herself with this Light, called "100 blessings," for, %0ahaving received this Light, ZON can ascend to the permanent place of YESHSUT %0abetween the Chazeh and the Tabur of AA. %0a%0aBy ascending to this degree, Malchut becomes like Ima. In the spiritual %0aworld, the degree of a spiritual object determines all of its properties. Even %0ain our world, the degree of man's inner development alone determines his %0aproperties, thoughts, and desires. And since Ima equals 100, Malchut, too, is %0acalled "100," so as to emphasize the fact that Malchut ascended to Bina of the %0aworld of Atzilut. %0a%0aNow Malchut is similar to MI just as YESHSUT was prior to raising MAN and %0apassing the Light. This is because she now clothes the place of the small state of %0aYESHSUT from the Chazeh to the Tabur of AA, and stands under the Parsa of the %0aworld of Atzilut, below which the Light from the Rosh de AA cannot pass. %0a%0aThat is why Malchut gained no Light, for the sake of which she had raised %0aMAN. Nevertheless, Malchut gains by receiving the properties of Ima-Bina, for %0ashe ascended to YESHSUT, called Ima. %0a%0aHence, the Light that Malchut received is only considered VAK of the Gadlut %0astate, the first state of Gadlut. Malchut will not be able to receive the GAR of %0aGadlut, the second Gadlut, the Light of Hochma (Haya), as long as she is under %0athe Parsa of Atzilut in the Chazeh of AA. (How Malchut receives GAR of the %0aGadlut is explained in items 11 through 15 in the next article). %0a%0a%0a%0a80 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar calls Nukva that ascended to YESHSUT by the word MA (from %0athe word Me'ah— 100), for by means of this ascent, Malchut gained the properties %0aof Bina—100 blessings. And she gained the sensation of the question— she feels %0athat it has only VAK (a half, a part of the big state). Put differently, she feels the %0adesire for its second half, GAR. Nevertheless, she gained a part of the big state, %0aVAK of AVI. %0a%0aThus, Nukva became like YESHSUT before it raised MAN, but gained the %0aproperties of Bina, 100 blessings. And since this is VAK of the Light of the big %0astate, she feels a deficiency (a question), just as YESHSUT felt prior to raising %0aMAN— at its place, when YESHSUT was in the Katnut state. When it ascended %0ato AVI, AVI ascended to AA, and ZON ascended to the place of YESHSUT AVI %0ashine from the Rosh of AA on the place of YESHSUT ZON that stand there now %0afeel the Light that they receive from AVI, and realize that this is merely a part of %0athe Light, which generates another question within them. %0a%0a9. This is the secret defined by the word MA: WHAT do you testify and %0aWHAT is equal to you? When the Temple was destroyed, a voice came forth %0aand said, "What (MA) shall I indicate to you, and what (MA) shall I equate %0ato you?" (Eicha, 2:13). However, here MA means, "What is the covenant, %0atestimony, what (MA) is equal to you?" For every day testifies to you the days %0aof past, as it is said: "This day I call onto Heaven and earth to witness for you" %0a(Devarim, 30:19). WHAT is equal to you? It is said: "I adorned you with holy %0aadornments and made you ruler of the world." And it is said: "Is this the %0acity that men called the quintessence of beauty?" {Eicha, 2:15). I have called %0ayou, "Jerusalem, a city rebuilt by me" (Tehilim, 122:3). "What shall I equate %0ato you?" (Eicha, 2:13). Just as you sit here, so He sits Above in Supernal %0aJerusalem. Just as the holy nation does not enter into you, so I swear to you %0athat I will not enter Above until I enter you down below. And this is your %0aconsolation— that I will equate you with this degree, with Supernal Jerusalem, %0awhich is the Supernal Malchut (Hebrew - Kingdom) that rules over all. But %0afor now you are here, and "Your misery is great, like the sea" (Eicha, 2:13). %0aAnd if you say that there is no existence or salvation for you, then WHO (MI) %0ashall heal you (not Who? with a question mark, but the Upper Force called %0aWHO is what will heal you), that is, that same concealed Upper Degree, which %0ais called MI, Bina that revives all, shall heal and revive you. %0a%0aIn other words, MA and MI, besides being translated as WHAT and WHO, %0aalso designate the names of spiritual objects that perform actions described %0ain The Zohar. The destruction of the Temple was the consequence of Israel's %0a%0a%0a%0aWho Created These %0a%0a%0a%0a81 %0a%0a%0a%0atransgression of egoistic reception, because they did not want to raise MAN %0afor the Zivug of ZON, and instead wished to receive the Light into the impure %0aforces, their egoistic desires, called "other gods" (Elokim Acherim). There is %0aonly one Creator. %0a%0aThere is but one property for the Creator, and we know it— the property %0aof bestowal. Drawing closer to this property is defined as working "for the %0aCreator's sake." Any other desire can only mean distancing from this property %0aand from the Creator, for except for this property or its opposite (rather, its %0aabsence), nothing else exists in creation. Hence, man's inner movement towarc %0athe property of "reception" pushes him away from the Creator, and is there %0acalled "worshipping other gods." As a result, ZON stopped their Zivug, the %0ablessings disappeared from Nukva, and the Temple was ruined. %0a%0aThe First Temple— Malchut ascended to AVI and there receives the Light of %0aHaya. Its ruin is the fall of Malchut to the level of reception of the Light GAR %0ade Ruach. %0a%0aThe Second Temple is Malchut 's ascension to YESHSUT and the reception %0aof the Light of Neshama. In its ruin, Malchut fell to the level of reception of the %0aLight of Nefesh in her Sefira Keter, while the other nine Sefirot fall below the %0aParsa. Such a state is called Galut— exile from the spiritual, from the world of %0aAtzilut. The single Sefira Malchut in the world of Atzilut remains as a point below %0athe Sefira Yesod of ZA. %0a%0aZA is called "six days" and Malchut is called Shahhat (Saturday). Yet, is Malchut %0areally bigger than ZA, as Shahhat is bigger (higher) than weekdays? The worlds %0aof BYA, including our world, receive the Light, their life-force, from Malchut. %0aThe "six weekdays" are a state of ZON when ZA and Malchut are unconnected %0ato one another. Shabbat is a state of ZON when Malchut joins with ZA, a Zivug %0atakes place between them, and Malchut receives the Light from ZA and passes it %0aon to the whole world. %0a%0aSince the state of Malchut when she passes the Light received from ZA down %0ato the world is important to us, by measuring our states in accordance with what %0awe receive from Malchut, we define the extent of maximal reception as Shahhat. %0a(Naturally, this has nothing to do with our calendar: weekdays and Shabbat are %0aspiritual states that transcend time). %0a%0aAND A VOICE CAME FORTH AND SAID: "EACH AND EVERY DAY %0aMY COVENANT HAS BEEN IN YOU SINCE THE DAYS OF PAST"- %0ahere, The Zohar speaks of the Light of VAK that ZON receive in the state of %0aGadlut, which Nukva receives as MA. This Light is called "the past days" (Yamim %0a%0a%0a%0a82 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aKadmonim). Therefore, it is written in the Torah (Devarim, 4:32): "Ask now of %0athe past days, which were before you, since the day the Creator created man, %0afrom one edge of Heaven unto the other, whether there has been any such thing %0aas great as this?..." %0a%0aThe Light of VAK of the Gadlut state is called in ZON "the past days," for %0ait is VAK of AVI. YESHSUT is ZAT of AVI. ZAT is an abbreviation of the words %0aZayin (7), and Tachtonot (lower, meaning the lower Sefirot). ZAT of AVI, meaning %0athe seven Sefirot of Partzuf AVI, is YESHSUT. These Zayin are seven days, the %0aseven primary Sefirot of AVI with regard to Zayin, the seven days or the seven %0aSefirot of ZON. %0a%0aHence, it is written, "MY COVENANT EACH AND EVERY DAY BY %0aHEAVEN AND EARTH" (Devarim, 4:26). These words of the Torah speak of %0athe Zivug of ZON called "Heaven" (ZA) and "earth" (Nukva). "The past days" %0aor "Supernal Days" constitute YESHSUT, and "the low days" or "the present %0adays" are ZON. %0a%0aIn this sentence, the Creator cautions that the Zivug of ZON needs to be %0aconstantly realized and maintained. Otherwise, the Creator warns that "you will %0adisappear from the earth." And this is the meaning of the Creator's warning %0aabout the 100 blessings: they should be guarded and constantly created. %0a%0aFor these 100 blessings that Nukva receives from ZA every day in the Zivug of %0aMA between them take place during the ascent of ZON to YESHSUT, when ZA %0abecomes like YeshS (Israel-Saba) and Nukva becomes like T (Tvunah). YESHSUT %0astands for Israel-Saba and Tvunah. And then, the Light that Nukva receives from %0aZA becomes 100 blessings, like the Light in Tvunah. %0a%0aIt is said about it, "the city that united with her," for Nukva, called "city," %0amerged with Tvunah, and Nukva became like Tvunah. And Nukva receives in %0aTvunah the Light oi Tvunah, called "holy adornments," and then, like a crown of %0abeauty, she surrounds the earth and receives power over the earth. %0a%0aHowever, as a result of Israel's transgressions (the rise of impure desires %0aover the pure ones), the Temple is ruined (the Light disappeared), and Israel %0ais banished from its land (fell to lower degrees). This led to the distancing of %0aNukva (all creatures) from ZA (the Creator), for the lower nine Sefirot (desires) of %0aNukva fell to the impure forces (became egoistic). In other words, the nine pure, %0aaltruistic desires (forces) lost their screen and became egoistic, and Nukva herself %0aturned into a point that stands below the Sefira Yesod of ZA. %0a%0aHence, it is written: "WHO SHALL REBUILD YOU AND HEAL YOU"- %0aif the sons of Israel return in their aspirations to the Creator (to altruism), called %0a%0a%0a%0aWho Created These %0a%0a%0a%0a83 %0a%0a%0a%0a"the return," correct their deeds (desires), and raise their prayers (MAN) for help %0ain their correction to the Creator in ZON, they will once more be able to receive %0athe Upper Light in ZON, Nukva will rise again to YESHSUT, called MI, and will %0abe healed thereby (the Upper Light will enter Malchut, the souls, and will impart %0aits properties onto them). %0a%0a10. MI-WHO sets the boundary of Heaven Above— YESHSUT. MA- %0aWHAT sets the boundary of Heaven below— ZA and Malchut. And this is %0awhat Yaakov inherited, as he is ZA that shines from end to end. From one %0aboundary, which is MI, to the other boundary, which is MA. For he, Yaakov, %0astands in the middle, between YESHSUT and Malchut. Hence, it is said, %0aMI BARAH ELEH: MI is YESHSUT, BARAH means created, and ELEH %0astands for ZA and Malchut. %0a%0aActually, it should rather be written, "from the beginning, i.e., from the %0aHeight of Heaven down to its end (lowest point) below." Yet it says, "from the %0aboundary of Heaven." MI is YESHSUT that upholds everything with its question, %0athe desire to receive the Light for ZON. MA is Nulcva. Before Nulcva raises MAN, %0ashe is the very last degree, standing below the Chazeh of ZA. Between YESHSUT %0aand Nulcva stands Yaakov— ZA that clothes AA from Tabur to Malchut of AA. %0a%0a%0a%0aCreator %0a%0aThe World of AK %0a%0a%0a%0a%0aThe World of Atzilut %0a%0a(Atik inside of AA is unattainable) %0a%0a%0a%0aParsa %0a%0aof the World %0aof Atzilut %0a%0a%0a%0a9 %0a%0alower %0aSefirot %0aof Malchut %0a%0a%0a%0aThe World of Beria %0aThe World of Yetzira %0aThe World of Assiya %0a%0a%0a%0aParsa %0a%0aof the Worlds %0aABYA %0a%0a%0a%0aThis World %0a%0a%0a%0a84 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aArich Anpin is the central Partzuf in the world of Atzilut. Since Atik is %0aunattainable, everything comes from AA, and all the Partzufim of the world of %0aAtzilut clothe it (receive from it): Rosh de AA towers over all, and no one can %0aclothe it, meaning no one can attain its thoughts and reasons for its actions. %0a%0aThe next Partzuf is AVI. AVI clothe (attain) AA from Peh to Chazeh. Below AVI %0astands Partzuf YESHSUT, clothing AA from Chazeh to Tahur. ZA stands below %0aYESHSLT and clothes AA from Tahur downwards. Partzuf ZA is incomplete, as %0ahe has only six Sefirot HBD-HGT or VAK; he is in the Katnut state, ending with %0ahis Sefira Tifferet (his Chazeh). %0a%0aNukm (Malchut) stands below ZA, or parallel to his last Sefira Tifferet (the %0aChazeh of ZA). She has only one Sefira Keter, whereas her nine other Sefirot %0afell below the Parsa to the worlds BYA. The entire world of Atzilut ends at %0athe Chazeh of ZA, where the single Sefira of Malchut stands, who is therefore %0acalled a point. %0a%0aIn our world, there is desire and its physical manifestation— action. For %0aexample, one wants to receive something, but he does not allow himself to %0aperform the physical act of taking. Meanwhile, his desire to take remains the %0asame. In the spiritual world, there are no bodies, only bare desires. Therefore, %0athe desire itself already constitutes action, like an already completed mental %0aand physical action in our world. Therefore, the desire alone determines man's %0aspiritual state. %0a%0aJust imagine what it would be like if in our world we judged a person not by %0ahis actions, but by his desires! It is terrifying to think how distant we are from %0aspiritual demands. However, our desires are determined by our spiritual degree. %0aAnd The Zohar explains that only by raising MAN (the request for correctic %0acan we attract onto us the flow of Upper Light, which will correct and elevate %0ato a Higher Degree. And we will immediately begii %0athat degree will evoke within us. %0a%0aTherefore, our task is to attain the desire for correction. To this end, we %0aneed a "question," perception of our state as intolerable. This is called the %0arealization of evil, i.e., that our egoism is evil, that it brings me harm by severing %0ame from the spiritual. %0a%0aHowever, in order for this to happen, we need %0alittle bit of what the spiritual is and how good it is. Evil %0acontrast with good. Yet, how can we sense the spiritual if we have yet to %0aegoism? In what Kelim (desires) can we sense this? Even though we lack corrected %0adesires, and therefore cannot sense the spiritual, as a result of studying Kabbalah, %0a%0a%0a%0a%0aWho Created These %0a%0a%0a%0a85 %0a%0a%0a%0aone begins to sense the Surrounding Light, which bestows onto him the desire %0afor the spiritual (See "Introduction to the Study of the Ten Sefirot," item 155). %0a%0aThe desire of one who physically exists in our world, but spiritually exists %0ain the worlds of BYA— is a desire to enjoy the Light. However, opposite these %0adesires one has an "anti-desire," a screen, which neutralizes his innate will to %0areceive pleasure. %0a%0aA screen is created (appears, emerges, born) within the Kli (desire, man) as a %0aresult of man's sensation of the spiritual Light (the Creator). Therefore, all our %0arequests (prayers, MAN, "questions") should be about one thing only: for the %0aCreator to grant us the strength necessary to ascend spiritually, to transform our %0adesires or, as Kabbalah defines it, to acquire a screen. It is impossible to annul %0aone's will to receive pleasure. The Creator created it, and it is His only creation. %0aAll we can do is acquire a screen (counterbalance) on it, thereby ascending above %0acreation (egoism), and become similar to the Creator! And to the extent of this %0asimilarity, to merge with him. %0a%0aThus, Partzuf Yaakov stands from MI (YESHSUT) to MA (Malchut), from %0aend to end. However, what is referred to here is the state of ZON, when they %0aascend to YESHSUT and receive the Light of its degree. %0a%0aThe entire spiritual distance from us to the Creator is divided into 125 %0ainvisible degrees, all of them named. These degrees differ from one another %0aonly by the magnitude of their screen on man's egoistic desires. Man receives %0athe Light in his corrected, altruistic desires. The volume of the received Light %0adepends on the screen's magnitude (the size of the desire's corrected part). %0a%0aEvery degree is characterized by a particular sensation of the Creator, and %0athis sensation is called Light. Hence, we can designate the spiritual state of the %0aKli (man) in the spiritual world by the name of its degree or the name of the %0aLight it receives, as every degree has its own particular Light. These gradations of %0athe sensation of the Creator are precisely what we call spiritual degrees. %0a%0aThat is why, having ascended to a degree called YESHSUT, ZON receive %0athe Light of YESHSUT, although Partzuf YESHSUT itself ascended, accordingly, %0ato a Higher Degree, and there receives the Light of that degree, called AVI. In %0aturn, AVI ascend to a degree called AA, where they receive the Light of AA. We %0acall degrees by the names of the Partzufim that abide there in their usual, lowest %0astate. Such a state is called permanent. %0a%0aEven though by ascending to a Higher Degree, the lower Partzuf receives %0athe Light of that degree, which changes its properties, the Partzuf remains itself %0anonetheless, just as a person who acquires new properties remains a person, %0a%0a%0a%0a86 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0athough now one of another level. Therefore, when it is said, "having ascended %0ato the Upper One, the lower one becomes like him," it implies a change only in %0athe inner properties of man (or Partzuf), but not in his identity. %0a%0aUpon ascending to YESHSUT, ZA receives greater Light, for an ascent %0ain the spiritual world signifies an increase in the magnitude of a screen, and, %0aaccordingly, reception of greater Light. That is to say, ZA himself grew, but did %0anot turn into YESHSUT: previously, at his own place, he had only the Light %0aRuach-Nefesh, but upon ascending and acquiring a screen, he receives the Light %0aof Neskama as well. %0a%0aTherefore, all the places between us and the Creator are established, and %0athe Partzufim that are there "stand" on them in their permanent place. However, %0aall the Partzufim and the worlds can ascend relative to their permanent, lowest %0astates by one, two, or three degrees. In its lowest state, a Partzuf has only GE and %0ano AHP, and only the Light of Nefesh-Ruach. %0a%0aBy receiving the Light of correction from Above, the Partzuf can gradually %0acorrect its AHP: it corrects the Sefira Bina and receives the Light of Neshama, %0awhich designates an ascent of one degree. After that, the Partzuf corrects %0athe Sefira ZA, and receives the Light of Haya, which designates an ascent %0ato another degree, i.e., already two degrees. And after that, it corrects Sefira %0aMalchut and receives the Light of Yechida, which designates an ascent to yet %0aanother degree, a third one. %0a%0a%0a%0aHochma = Eynaim %0aParsa, Nikvey Eynaim, Masach of Partzuf %0a%0aBina = Awzen ( ascen t of Bina to GE = ascent by 1 degree) %0aZA =Hotem (ascent of ZA to GE = ascent by 2 degrees) %0aMalchut = Peh (ascent of Malchut to GE = ascent by 3 degrees) %0a%0a%0a%0aHowever, the new Light does not enter the just corrected Kli (Sefira), but %0acomes from Above and enters through the Sefira Keter. %0a%0a%0a%0a%0aWho Created These %0a%0a%0a%0a87 %0a%0a%0a%0aSEFIRA %0a%0a%0a%0aLIGHT %0a%0aYechida %0a%0a%0a%0aHaya %0a%0a%0a%0aNeshama %0a%0a%0a%0aRuach %0a%0a%0a%0aNefesh %0a%0a%0a%0aKeter %0a%0a%0al« %0a%0a%0aHochma %0a%0a%0aBina %0a%0a%0aAHP %0a%0a%0aZA %0a%0a%0aMalchut %0a%0a%0a%0aMan's spiritual ascent can be the consequence of two factors: %0a%0a1. An awakening of a desire from Above, called "special days"— holidays, %0anew moons, Sabbaths. This kind of an ascent is called "an awakening %0afrom Above," and leads to the general ascent of all the worlds ABYA, %0aand, consequently, of all that inhabits them. %0a%0a2. Man's efforts in his studies and inner work, his prayer to merit the Cre- %0aator personally giving him the strength to ascend to a Higher Degree. %0a%0aMoreover, such an ascent is not limited to only three degrees, but can elevate %0aman along all 125 degrees to the Creator Himself. Ascension to the Highest %0aDegree is precisely the purpose for which man was created. He must accomplish %0athis task while still living in this world. And until he attains this goal, he will %0ahave to return to this world again and again. %0a%0aAlthough ZON are called "the last days," upon ascending and receiving the %0aLight of YESHSLT, they receive the name "the days past or first days." In this %0ainstance, one boundary of Heaven (Malchut or MA) ascends and clothes the %0aother boundary of Heaven (YESHSUT or MI). MA and MI merge in one, and %0aThe Zohar emphasizes that fact. AND KNOW: %0a%0aMl - WHO %0a%0a%0a%0aBARAH - CREATED %0a%0a%0a%0aELEH - THIS %0a%0a%0a%0a88 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aMI is YESHSUT that stands in the place of Bina de AA, from Chazeh to Tabur %0ade AA. And although only Kelim of GE (vessels of bestowal) are present in the %0aworld of Atzilut, there are Partzufirn among them that wish only to "bestow": %0aAtik, AA, AVI, and those that want to receive for the sake of bestowal, so as to %0apass the Light on to YESHSUT and ZON. %0a%0aWorld of Atzilut %0aAtik %0a%0aAA > These 3 Partzufirn form GE of the World of Atzilut %0a%0aAVI %0a%0aParsa of the World of Atzilut %0a%0aYESHSUT %0a%0aZA ) These 3 Partzufirn form AHP of the World of Atzilut %0a%0aMalchut %0a%0a%0a%0aYESHSUT and ZON want to receive the Light so as to pass it to the souls of %0athe righteous, the people who seek correction. Hence, within the world of Atzilut %0athere is a division into two types of Kelim— GE and AHP. They are separated from %0aeach other by the Parsa of the world of Atzilut that stands in the Chazeh of AA. %0a%0a%0a%0aWorld of Atzilut %0a%0a%0a%0aAtik %0a%0a%0a%0aZON %0a%0a%0a%0aYESHSUT %0a%0a%0a%0aAVI %0a%0a%0a%0aAA %0aRosh %0a-Peh — %0a%0aChazeh - %0a%0a%0a%0a-Tabur — %0aRaglaim %0a%0a%0a%0aParsa %0a%0aof the World %0aof Atzilut %0a%0aParsa between %0aAtzilut and the %0aWorlds BYA %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Light from the Rosh de AA does not pass below the Parsa of the world of %0aAtzilut. Therefore, YESHSUT in its permanent state, or ZON, when they ascend %0a%0a%0a%0aWho Created These %0a%0a%0a%0a89 %0a%0a%0a%0ato YESHSUT, cannot receive the Light of Rosh de AA. This is why they have the %0adesire to receive the Light of Hochma, called "question." The question (desire %0ato receive the Light of Hochma) therefore amounts to MI (YESHSUT, the Light %0aof YESHSUT), which is BARAH (beyond ELEH-ZON), and upon their ascent, %0aZON do not receive the Light of Hochma, as they are outside the Rosh of AA, %0aoutside of the Light of Hochma, but with a question (a desire for it). This enables %0athem to continue their ascent. %0a%0a%0a%0aWho Created These (by Eliyahu) %0a%0a%0a%0a11. Rabbi Shimon said: "Elazar, my son, reveal the supernal secret, which %0athe dwellers of this world know nothing about." Rabbi Elazar was silent. %0aRabbi Shimon wept and paused for a moment, and then said, "Elazar, what %0ais ELEH?" If you say that they are like the stars and the signs of the zodiac %0a(destiny), are they not always visible (unlike the changeable signs of destiny)? %0aAnd in MA, that is in Malchut, they were created as it is written, "By the %0aword of the Creator were the Heavens made" (Tehilim, 33:6), meaning that %0athe Heavens were made by Mcdchut, called the Creator's word. And if ELEH %0aspeak of the hidden secrets, then there would be no need to write ELEH, as %0athe stars and the signs of destinies are visible to all (the word ELEH (THIS) %0atells us that something is clear). %0a%0aRabbi Elazar did not reveal the reception of the Light of the first Gadlut %0astate (Ohr Neshama), and Rabbi Shimon wished to reveal the way to receive the %0aLight of the second Gadlut state (Ohr Haya). Therefore, he asked Rabbi Elazar %0ato speak and to reveal the way to attain Ohr Neshama, which is concealed from %0apeople by a supernal secret, for this Light has not yet been revealed in the world, %0aand Rabbi Shimon reveals it here. %0a%0aThe fact is that, although there were righteous who attained the Light of %0aHaya, there was no one among them who could explain the path of its attainment %0ain detail, no one who could reveal it to the entire world. This is so because to %0aunderstand means to attain, to ascend to that degree, which depends only on %0aman's efforts. While there were many people throughout the generations who %0aattained the degree of ELEH, revealing it to the world requires an even greater %0adegree, and a special permission by the Creator (See the article The Conditions %0afor Disclosing the Secrets of the Wisdom of Kabbalah). %0a%0aRabbi Shimon asked him what ELEH means, what new things is the Torah %0atelling us with the words, MI BARAH ELEH (WHO CREATED THESE), where %0a%0a91 %0a%0a%0a%0a92 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0athe word ELEH designates ZON? After all, if it speaks of the stars and the signs %0aof the zodiac— luck, which signify the Light of VAK of the big state, then what %0ais so special about it? After all, ZON can receive this Light even on weekdays. %0aThere is nothing so extraordinary in this to mention MI - WHO CREATED %0aTHIS separately. %0a%0a(One might say that this Light is constant, for only the Light of VAK is %0aconstantly present in ZON, but not GAR. And only as a result of MAN does %0aZON receive the Light of VAK of the big state, the Light of Neshama. The answer %0alies in that this Light can be received at any time, even on weekdays during the %0amorning prayer. However, he still does not understand why these were created %0ain MA. After all, Light refers not to Bina, but to the ZON of the world of At^ilut, %0acalled MA, and exits them, as is written BY THE WORD OF THE CREATOR, %0awhere the Creator is ZA and His word is Malchut.) %0a%0a12. However, this secret was revealed on another day, when I was on the %0aseashore. The prophet Eliyahu came to me and said: "Rabbi, do you know %0athe meaning of MI BARAH ELEH - WHO HAS CREATED THESE?" I %0aanswered: "These are the Heavens and its forces, the works of the Creator, %0alooking at which, people should bless Him, as it is said, 'When I behold Your %0aHeavens, the work of Your hands' (Tehilim, 8:4), and 'O LORD! Our Lord! %0aHow glorious is Your name throughout all the earth!'" (Tehilim, 8:10). %0a%0a13. He replied to me: "Rabbi, the Creator took the concealed and revealed it %0ato the Celestial Council. And here it is: When the most Concealed of all that %0aare Concealed desired to reveal Himself, He first made a single point, which %0ais Mcdchut, and it ascended to His Thought, that is, into Bina, meaning that %0aMalcHwt ascended and merged with Bina. In her, He shaped all the creatures, %0aand in her confirmed all the laws." %0a%0aAtilc is the first Partzuf and the Rosh of the world of Atzilut. And it is called %0athe most concealed and secret of all the Partzufim, and its name— Atilc (from the %0aword Ne'etok— isolated, unattainable) testifies to that fact. No one can attain %0athis Partzuf in itself, its properties, but we can attain it the way it appears to %0aus: Atilc deliberately diminishes and changes itself in such a way that the lower %0aones could attain the outer form (its properties) in which it appears to them, %0abut not Atilc itself. %0a%0aIn the words of The Zohar, when Atilc wished to reveal itself to the worlds, %0aalthough it is a Partzuf that acts according to the laws of the first restriction, it %0a"clothed itself in the garments" (an external Partzuf that acts according to the %0a%0a%0a%0aWho Created These (by Eliyahu) %0a%0a%0a%0a93 %0a%0a%0a%0alaws of the second restriction) with regard to the lower ones so as to enable them %0ato perceive and attain it. %0a%0aThere is an enormous difference between the properties of the sensory %0aorgans that perceive sensations of the first and the second restrictions. Just as %0aman in our world is born without sensory organs that can perceive spiritual %0aworlds, which is why he cannot sense them, so is the Partzuf that is corrected %0afor the conditions of spiritual work at the level of the second restriction unable %0ato accept (perceive) the Light that descends according to the law of the first %0arestriction. A similar distinction exists between Partzuf Atik and the other %0aPartzufim of the world of Atzilut and the worlds of BYA. %0a%0aTo be connected to the lower ones, Atik elevated Malchut de Rosh de AA %0awithin the Rosh of the lower-standing AA up to the Sefira Hochma. As a result, %0aSefirot Bina and ZON de Rosh de AA fell from the Rosh of AA to its Guf. After %0aall, Malchut ascended from the Peh to the Eynaim and stood in the Rosh at place %0aof Bina, whereas Bina and ZON exited the Rosh. The Guf (body) begins after %0aMalchut de Rosh (after the decision on how to act), wherever it may be. %0a%0aHere is how one should understand this: the Sefirot of the Rosh are the %0athoughts and desires with regards to which the Partzuf, man's inner properties %0a(man himself) makes the decisions as to how they can be used in order to advance %0aas much as possible toward the goal of creation. The fact that Sefirot Bina and %0aZON exited the Rosh of AA means that Partzuf AA cannot make any decisions %0awith regard to them for lack of a screen on them. This is why they fell into the %0aGuf, outside the Rosh. %0a%0aHence, their remaining role is only to receive the Light from the Rosh, just %0aas it is received by all the Sefirot of the Guf. In other words, they receive the Light %0athat is accepted by the screen of Sefirot Keter and Hochma that remained in the %0aRosh. Man deliberately restricts the use of his desires, and uses only those desires %0awith which he can work for the Creator's sake. %0a%0aTherefore, when Malchut ascended and stood under the Sefira Hochma, %0aHochma became like the male part (bestowing, fulfilling), and Malchut became %0alike the female (receiving) part of the Rosh. And since Malchut took the place of %0aBina (called "thought"), Malchut assumed the name "thought," since now it's %0aMalchut that makes a Zivug and receives Ohr Hochma. %0a%0aA Partzuf that receives from Hochma is defined as Bina, and not Malchut. %0aTherefore, although Malchut herself is merely a black point (egoistic creature), as %0aa result of her ascent, she becomes Bina, i.e., Malchut acquires Bina's properties. %0aHence, Malchut is now called Bina or "thought." %0a%0a%0a%0a94 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar calls a "thought" either to Hochma or to Bina. The difference is %0athat a thought is something that is received from Hochma. Hence, Bina is called %0aa thought only if she is in the Rosh and receives the Light from Hochma. In %0athe first restriction, Bina always receives from Hochma, and is called "thought." %0aHowever, in the second restriction, Malchut ascended above Bina and started %0areceiving from Hochma. That is why it is Malchut that is now called "thought," %0aand not Bina. %0a%0aAll the Partzufim of the worlds of ABYA are created by this ascent of Malchut %0ato Bina. Therefore, it is written: IN HER HE SHAPED ALL THE CREATURES, %0aAND IN HER CONFIRMED ALL THE LAWS-Se/irot Keter and Hochma %0aremained in the Rosh of each Partzuf, and a Zivug was made on these two Sefirot. %0aThis is why the Light received in Guf of the Partzuf consists of only two Lights, %0aNe/esh and Ruach. %0a%0aPreviously, Malchut stood in Peh de Rosh and the Rosh (the part of the Partzuf %0ain which it calculated how much Light it can receive for the Creator's sake) %0aended there. Then, the Partzuf would receive that Light from the Rosh to the %0aGuf, between the Peh and the Tahur. %0a%0aBut now Malchut ascended to Eynaim de Rosh and stands under them. This %0ais known as the ascent of Malchut to NE (Nikvey Eynaim - pupils of the eyes), %0awhich are called NE precisely because Nikvey Eynaim means Malchut of the eyes. %0aPrior to Malchut's ascent to the Eynaim, it was as though there were no pupils %0a(NE). It is worth noting that only in Malchut (desire) can we feel what surrounds %0aus (the Creator, Light). This is why all of our sensory organs are designed as %0aapertures: Nekev (orifice), Nukva, Malchut in the eyes, Awznaim (ears), Hotem %0a(nose) and Peh (mouth). %0a%0aOnly he who can create desires that work according to the principle of the %0asecond restriction through his own strength and effort, and puts Malchut after %0aer-Hochma (thinks in terms of bestowal), can start perceiving through tl %0ated spiritual sensory organ. Wherever there is a screen, it constitutes %0a%0aUpon her ascent, Malchut stood under Hochma and made a Zivug on her %0aown screen, on Sefirot Keter-Hochma (GE). Sefirot Bina-ZA-Malchut (AHP) are %0alocated below the Rosh, in the Guf of the Partzuf, and passively receive the Light %0afrom the Rosh. This leads to a division of the ten Sefirot of the Guf, KHB-ZA-M, %0ain the same way the ten Sefirot of the Rosh were divided: Sefirot K-H of the Guf %0acontinue receiving from K-H of the Rosh, and Sefirot B-ZA-M of the Guf, being %0aunable to receive from the Rosh, start receiving from K-H of the Guf, like the %0aSefirot below the Tahur of the Partzuf. %0a%0a%0a%0aWho Created These (by Eliyahu) %0a%0a%0a%0a95 %0a%0a%0a%0aAs is well-known, every Partzuf consists of a Rosh, a Guf, and extremities. %0aThe Rosh decides how much Light the Guf can receive for the Creator's sake, in %0aaccordance with the magnitude of the screen that reflects the Light (pleasure). %0aThe decision to accept this Light causes the Light to descend through the screen, %0afrom the Rosh to the Guf, filling it from the Peh down to the Tahur. Each Sefira %0aof the Rosh fills its corresponding Sefira in the Guf. %0a%0a%0a%0aPartzuf in the 1 st Restriction %0a%0a%0a%0aKeter %0aHochma %0aBina %0aZA %0a%0aMalchut %0a%0a%0a5 Parts of the Head %0aMouth %0a%0a%0a%0a%0aKeter %0aHochma %0aBina %0aZA %0a%0aMalchut %0a%0a%0a5 Parts of the Body %0aTabur %0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0aKeter %0aHochma %0aBina %0aZA %0a%0aMalchut %0a%0a%0a5 Parts of the Extremities %0aFeet %0a%0a%0aPartzuf in the 2 nd Restriction %0a%0a%0aKeter %0aHochma %0a%0a%0a%0a%0aMouth %0a%0a%0a2 Parts of the Head %0a%0a%0aBina %0aZA %0a%0aMalchut %0a%0a%0aKeter %0aHochma %0a%0a%0a2 Parts of the Body %0a%0aTabur %0a%0a%0a%0a%0aBina %0aZA %0a%0aMalchut %0a%0a%0aKeter %0aHochma %0a%0a%0a2 Parts of the Extremities %0aFeet %0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0aBina %0aZA %0a%0aMalchut %0a%0a%0aParts outside of Partzuf %0a%0a%0a%0a96 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aIf there are only two Sefirot K-H in the Rosh, then only the two Sefirot K-H %0aremain in the Guf. This is because only they can receive from the corresponding %0aSefirot in the Rosh. Sefirot B-ZA-M of the Rosh receive the same Light as Sefirot K-H %0aof the Guf, which means that they are located under the screen (Malchut that %0aascends and stands under Hochma de Rosh). Thus, the Guf contains K-H that %0areceive, accordingly, the Lights Ruach-Nefesh, and AHP of the Rosh that receive %0athese two Lights of Ruach-Nefesh, too. %0a%0aB-ZA-M (AHP) of the Guf cannot receive the Light from the Rosh, as their %0acorresponding Sefirot B-ZA-M of the Rosh do not participate in a Zivug, since they %0alack the strength of the screen sufficient to reflect the egoistic desires of AHP %0ade Rosh so as to receive for the Creator's sake. In other words, since there are %0ano AHP in the Rosh, there are also no AHP in the Guf. And since AHP de Guf %0areceive no Light from AHP de Rosh, they are like the extremities— the end of a %0aPartzuf, below its Tabur. Hence, at the end of a Partzuf, below Tahur, there are GE %0aof Raglaim (feet) and AHP de Guf, which fell there. And AHP of Raglaim are not %0aparts of a Partzuf whatsoever, as they are located at a lower degree. %0a%0aThe Light that cannot be received by the Partzuf remains outside, surrounding %0ait, and waits until the Partzuf acquires the strength to receive it. It is called %0a"Surrounding Light," and it corresponds to the desires that do not take part in %0aa Zivug, those desires that are still uncorrected and lack a screen. %0a%0aIf, previously, before the second restriction, Malchut (the last Sefira of the %0aGuf) was in Tahur, now, when only two Sefirot K-H remain in the Guf, Malchut de %0aGuf, too, ascends to Bina de Guf, called Chazeh. Therefore, when Malchut ascends %0ato Bina de Rosh, the entire Partzuf "diminishes" in size: the Rosh reaches only up %0ato the Eynaim, the Guf only to the Chazeh, and the Raglaim only to Tabur. And %0athat is why this state of the Partzuf is called "the state of Katnut." %0a%0aHowever, if the Partzuf receives new strength from Above, acquires a Masach %0a(screen), it will be able to resolve to accept the Light for the Creator's sake in its %0aAHP, then AHP de Rosh will rise again from the Guf to the Rosh, and complete the %0aRosh to ten Sefirot, while the Sefirot of AHP de Guf will ascend from the Raglaim back %0ato their place in order to receive additional Light. And then Rosh, Guf, and Raglaim %0awill all contain ten Sefirot. This state of the Partzuf is called "the state of Gadlut." %0a%0aIn the language of The Zohar, the restriction of a Partzuf, its transition from %0athe Gadlut state to the Katnut state is described as a division of each part of the %0aPartzuf (Rosh, Guf, and Raglaim) into GE (MI) and AHP (ELEH). All ten Sefirot %0aare called by the Creator's name Elokim, which consists of the letters ELEH- %0aIM, that are further divided into MI - GE - K-H and ELEH - B-ZA-M. When %0ain Katnut, only Sefirot ELEH maintain their degree, whereas Sefirot IM fall to a %0a%0a%0a%0aWho Created These (by Eliyahu) %0a%0a%0a%0a97 %0a%0a%0a%0alower degree. The word Elokim is read from below upwards, the way they are %0aattained by man. %0a%0aPartzuf Partzuf %0a%0ain the Big State in the Small State %0a%0a%0a%0aM-K %0a%0a%0a%0a%0aM-K %0a%0a%0a%0a%0a1 -H %0a%0a%0a%0a%0a1 -H %0a%0a%0aParsa %0a%0a%0aE -B %0a%0a%0a%0a%0aE -B %0a%0a%0a%0a%0aL- ZA %0a%0a%0a!

EH - M ; %0a%0a%0a%0aIN HER HE SHAPED ALL THE CREATURES, AND IN HER %0aCONFIRMED ALL THE LAWS— alludes to the division of each degree into two %0aparts; their new form signifies the division into ELEH and MI, the separation %0aof the Kelim (desires) of "bestowal" and "reception," where, due to the lack of %0astrength to oppose one's nature (egoism), part of the Sefirot (desires) remain %0aunused, outside of their degree. Accordingly, their Light remains outside as %0aOhr Makif (Surrounding Light), and waits until the Partzuf acquires additional %0astrength to become big and thus receive all the Light. %0a%0aDuring the 6,000 years, our entire correction transpires only according to %0athe laws of T?imt?um Bet (second restriction). As soon as the Partzuf acquires new %0astrength (Masach) to receive the Light selflessly in Sefirot/ Kelim B-ZA-M (ELEH), %0ait will immediately attach them to itself and receive in them the Lights Neshama- %0aHaya-Yechida. And it will grow to become a big Partzuf consisting of five Kelim %0a(ten Sefirot) with the five Lights of NRNHY. %0a%0a14. He confirmed in the sacred and concealed candle (in Malchut that %0amerged with Bina), a concealed image, the Holy of Holies, a secret structure %0athat emerges from the thought, QAR that is called MI, which is the beginning %0aof this structure. It stands and it does not stand; it is great and concealed in %0athe name Elokim (ELEH and IM). It is called MI from the word Elokim, %0athat is, it lacks the letters ELEH of the name Elokim. He desired to be %0arevealed and called by the complete name Elokim, so He clothed Himself %0ain a splendid shining garment, the Light of Hassadim. He created ELEH. %0aThe letters ELEH of the name Elokim ascended and combined with the %0aletters MI and formed the complete name Elokim. And until He created %0aELEH, He did not rise (did not ascend) to the name Elokim. Hence, those %0awho sinned by worshipping the Golden Calf alluded to this secret by saying, %0a"ELEH (this is) your God, Israel!" (Shemot, 32:4). %0a%0a%0a%0a98 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0a"ELEH (this is) your God, Israel!"— that is, these egoistic desires (ELEH) are %0ayour deity, which you must worship until you correct yourself. The use of ELEH %0ais the reason for all transgressions and ruin: the breaking of the vessels (Kelim), %0athe sin of Adam and the shattering of his soul into 600,000 pieces, worshipping %0athe Golden Calf and the breaking of the Tablets by Moshe, the ruin of the First %0aand Second Temples, and so forth. %0a%0aAs a result of the lower ones raising MAN, meaning their request to %0areceive the strength necessary to make a Zivug and receive Ohr Hochma for %0athe Creator's sake, there descends from Above the Light called MAD (Mayin %0aDechurin)-the force that enables the Kli to create a Masach capable of reflecting %0aLight, thereby resisting its egoistic nature. This force comes in the form of %0aLight, the sensation of the Creator's greatness, and is referred to as the Light of %0aAB-SAG, as it descends from the Partzufim Hochma (AB) and Bina (SAG) of the %0aworld of AK (Adam Kadmon). %0a%0aIf one ascends from the degree called "our world" to the worlds BYA, then %0awherever he may be in those worlds, his request for spiritual correction will rise %0athrough all the worlds and degrees up to Partzuf SAG. SAG turns to AB, receives %0athe Light of Hochma from it, and passes it down to all the Partzufim along which %0aMAN had ascended. %0a%0aSince the entire world of AK exists in the first restriction (Tzimtzum Aleph) %0aand above the second restriction (Tzimtzum Bet), the Light that comes from %0ait provides the Kli that receives this Light with the strength to pass from the %0asmall state to the big one. In other words, the Light of AB-SAG enables the Kli %0ato create a Masach, reflect the Light of Hochma, and receive it for the Creator's %0asake. The Gadlut state is called "the holy of holies," for being filled with the %0aLight of GAR (the holy of holies) is utterly perfect. %0a%0aThe Light of AB-SAG first descends to the Rosh of Partzuf AA and lowers %0athe point (Malchut) from the thought (Bina) back to its place in the Peh, where %0ait was prior to Tzimtzum Bet. In consequence, the three Sefirot B-ZA-M rejoin the %0atwo Sefirot KH and become five Sefirot in the Rosh, AHP (ELEH) ascend and join %0awith GE (MI), and the Creator's name Elokim is completed. %0a%0aHowever, this does not mean that the Partzuf can be filled with the five %0aLights NRNHY; it merely acquires a Masach, the strength to receive the Light %0ain all its ten Sefirot. Since only Ohr Hochma shines in AA, this Light cannot %0afill the elevated Kelim of ELEH, as they can only receive Ohr Hochma if it is %0aclothed by Ohr Hassadim. Only the GAR of the Partzuf (K-H-B) can have pure %0aOhr Hochma; the ZAT of the Partzuf (Sefirot ZA-M) can only receive diminished %0a%0a%0a%0aWho Created These (by Eliyahu) %0a%0a%0a%0a99 %0a%0a%0a%0aOhr Hochma— half-mixed with Ohr Hassadim. This is called the reception of Ohr %0aHochma in the middle line (consisting of half Hochma and half Hassadim). %0a%0aTherefore, says The Zohar, THIS STRUCTURE STANDS AND IT DOES %0aNOT STAND— even though all the Sefirot are already present in the Rosh, %0athey still need to be filled with Light, meaning that Sefirot ELEH are not yet %0arevealed in the name Elokim. Only the letters MI have so far been revealed %0a(filled with the Light). %0a%0aHence, first, the Partzuf makes a Zivug on its Katnut state and receives Ohr %0aHassadim. Then, it clothes Ohr Hochma into PRECIOUS GARMENT (Ohr %0aHassadim). Only afterwards can the mixed Light of Hassadim and Hochma fill %0aSefirot ZAT (ELEH), and all five Sefirot will shine in perfection. %0a%0aHowever, before MI gives Ohr Hassadim to ELEH so as to enable ELEH %0ato receive Ohr Hochma in it, ELEH cannot receive Ohr Hochma, and only the %0aLight of MI shines in the entire name Elokim. Further, The Zohar tells us that %0aneglect of Ohr Hassadim (the intention for the Creator's sake) is precisely what %0aconstitutes the entire transgression. And since they transgressed, i.e., neglected %0aOhr Hassadim, that is, since they did not wish to receive with the intention "for %0athe Creator's sake," but desired only Ohr Hochma, they caused the separation %0aof MI from ELEH. Hence, it is written, ELEH - THIS (the desires of reception %0aand not MI, the desires of bestowal) IS YOUR LORD, ISRAEL-and the Light %0ainstantly passed to the impure forces. %0a%0aThe Torah does not tell us about the history of an ancient nation, but %0aabout the structure of the spiritual degrees that we must attain. To know the %0aproperties of these degrees (whose attainment is designated by the acquisition %0aof their properties), Kabbalah explains to us how they were originally created by %0aa gradual descent (spiritual coarsening) from the Creator Himself. %0a%0aAnd in order to give us an opportunity to correct our egoism, the Creator %0amixed it with altruism at the very creation of the spiritual degrees. This kind %0aof mixing of opposite properties is possible only through an "explosion," since %0aopposite properties cannot be combined otherwise. There were several such %0amixtures that occurred as a result of explosions (breaking of properties). %0a%0aOne of them is mentioned in the Torah (Shemot, 32:4), when, by worshiping %0athe Golden Calf, the sons of Israel (the altruistic desires of "bestowal") suddenly %0awished to receive the Light for themselves. Consequently, the Sefirot (Kelim) of %0aGE and AHP mixed together, and the properties (desires) of GE penetrated %0aAHP. Through these altruistic properties that are secretly concealed within a %0asmall, egoistic human being, it is possible to awaken him, to evoke in him an %0aaspiration to ascend spiritually and to disregard this world. %0a%0a%0a%0a100 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0a%0aved %0aiin %0a%0a%0a%0a;refore, everything that is written in the Torah should not be percer %0alot as history, but as an instruction manual. All the actions described %0athe Torah are positive: all the devastations, including the ruin of the First and %0athe Second Temples, wars, adultery and murder. We only need to realize what %0aexactly the Torah is telling us. And one can understand it correctly only if he %0astops perceiving it as a collection of injunctions referring to the mechanical %0aperformance of commandments. %0a%0a15. Just as MI join ELEH into one name Elokim, when Hochma clothes itself %0ain Hassadim, so is the name combined by this precious shining garment. %0aThe world exists thanks to this secret, as is written, "The world was created %0aby mercy." (Tehilim, 89:3). Then Eliyahu flew away, and I did not see him %0aanymore. Yet, it is from him that I discovered that I stood upon the secret and %0aits concealment. Rabbi Elazar approached with the others, and they bowed %0adown before him. They wept and said, "If we have come into this world %0aonly to hear this— it is enough for us!" %0a%0aRabbi Shimon continues his explanation: There is only one law of reception %0aof Ohr Hochma: Ohr Hochma can only be received if Ohr Hassadim clothes it %0abeforehand. Just as this occurs in Partzuf Bina, called "the Upper World," so %0adoes it occur in Partzuf Malchut (MA, ~Nukva of ZA), called "the lower world." %0aMalchut is typically referred to as BON, but when she joins ZA and receives the %0aLight from him, she is called by his name— MA. %0a%0aThe Upper World, Bina of the world of Atzilut, desires only Hassadim, %0abut the lower world, Malchut of the world of Atzilut, wants Hochma. However, %0aEliyahu the prophet spoke only of the order of Light and the structure of the %0aname Elokim in AVI (Bina de Atzilut), whereas Rabbi Shimon continues his %0aexplanation in the next article and describes the structure and reception of %0aLight in the name Elokim in Malchut de Atzilut herself.

In the beginning, Rabbi Elazar opened, "Raise your eyes and you shall %0a%3c see, WHO HAS CREATED THESE" (Xeshayahu, 40:26). Raise your eyes %0a%3c where? To the place on which all eyes depend. Who is He? He is the One who %0a%3c opens eyes, Mcdchut de Rosh de Arich Anpin. And there you shall see that %0a%3c Atik is concealed and within it lies the answer to the question: WHO HAS %0a%3c CREATED THESE? WHO? MI, ZAT de Bina, the Highest Edge of Heaven, %0a%3c and everything depends on Him. And since the question lies in Him, and He %0a%3c is concealed, He is called MI. For MI is like when the question "Who?" is %0a%3c asked, as there are no questions above Him. The question is found only at the %0a%3c Highest Boundary of Heaven. %0a%3c %0a%3c In the beginning, Rabbi Elazar opened, "Raise your eyes on high and look %0a%3c at who has created these." Raise your eyes to what place? To the place, where %0a%3c all eyes depend on Him. And who is He? He is the One who opens eyes. And %0a%3c there you shall know. It is the concealed Atik, within which lies the question: %0a%3c who has created these? And who is He? MI = who. He is called by the edge of the %0a%3c Supernal Heaven, where everything belongs to him. Since there lies a question, %0a%3c and He is on a concealed path and does not reveal Himself, He is called MI. %0a%3c And because there is no question Above, this edge of Heaven is called MI. %0a%3c %0a%3c In Hebrew, the word MI means the question "Who?" as well as the %0a%3c preposition "from." Since Kabbalah tells us about the property of our world's %0a%3c roots, one spiritual object can sometimes reveal an entire range of associations, %0a%3c properties, and categories. In the same way, here the word MI is a part of the %0a%3c word EloklM, where the last two letters form the word MI. However, at the same %0a%3c time, they carry a variety of additional charges and meanings. %0a%3c %0a%3c Rabbi Elazar wishes to explain how Heaven and earth were created. %0a%3c Naturally, just like the whole of the Torah, The Zohar refers only to spiritual %0a%3c degrees and categories, and does not deal with explanations of the physical %0a%3c %0a%3c 73 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 74 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c origin and development of our world. Moreover, it is impossible to understand %0a%3c the true origin and development of our world without attaining the spiritual %0a%3c world. However, whatever one does attain, he is unable to pass these attainments %0a%3c to others. Hence, even after he attains the full essence of our nature's origin %0a%3c and its actions, he will still be unable to describe it in a form that will be %0a%3c comprehensible to others. %0a%3c %0a%3c Heaven and earth constitute the seven days of Creation— ZON of the %0a%3c world of Atzilut. However, if it is a part of Atzilut, then why is it described as %0a%3c BARAH (created, from the word Beria) and not ATZIL (emanated, from the %0a%3c word Atzilut) 7 . Yet, precisely herein lies the opportunity to open our eyes to the %0a%3c process of creation. %0a%3c %0a%3c Rosh (head) de AA has only Keter and Hochma. Malchut standing below the %0a%3c eyes, below Sefira Hochma, is called "the opening of the eyes." After all, only %0a%3c when she opens up does the Light of Hochma pass through her from Rosh de AA %0a%3c to all the Partzufim of the world of Atzilut. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is therefore said that the eyes should be raised up TO THE PLACE %0a%3c ON WHICH ALL EYES DEPEND, for the Light of Hochma can fill all the %0a%3c Partzufim of the world of Atzilut only when Malchut opens up in Rosh de AA. %0a%3c Hence, the entire secret of the opening lies in Malchut. The Light of Hochma %0a%3c (the Light of Wisdom) is the Light of the eyes. It comes out of the eyes, and %0a%3c only in this Light can one see. %0a%3c %0a%3c The word BARAH signifies BAR (beyond), meaning outside the world %0a%3c of Atzilut. This is because Bina herself came out of the Rosh of AA and stood %0a%3c lower, outside the Rosh of AA, giving birth to, that is, precisely BARAH %0a%3c (creating) ZON. %0a%3c %0a%3c In Hebrew, every notion has several possible names that determine the %0a%3c specific action that takes place. Here, the birth of ZON occurred by means %0a%3c of Bina's exit and descent from her degree; hence, the birth of ZON is called %0a%3c BARAH, from the word BAR - outside (of one's degree). %0a%3c %0a%3c The entire creation consists of only ten Sefirot. Yet, since every Sefira includes %0a%3c all the others, and since all of them are interconnected, every world, degree, %0a%3c or Sefira includes the properties of all the others, and consists of their parts. %0a%3c Therefore, every Sefira consists of Keter, Hochma, Bina, ZA, and Malchut, each of %0a%3c which in turn consists of five. In all, 5x5x5 = 125 Sefirot or steps of the ladder %0a%3c that separate us (the lowest) from the Creator (the highest). %0a%3c %0a%3c The property of Bina herself is not to receive the Light of Hochma. Yet, in %0a%3c order to pass the Light of Hochma to ZA and Malchut, who desire to receive it for %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Who Created These %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 75 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c the Creator's sake, since receiving the Light of Hochma is the goal of creation, %0a%3c Bina allocates within herself a certain part called ZAT de Bina or YESHSUT, %0a%3c which receives the Light of Hochma from Partzuf Hochma and passes it to ZON. %0a%3c The main part, Bina herself, is called GAR de Bina. The part of Bina that receives %0a%3c the Light of Hochma is called ZAT de Bina. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, if Bina exits the Rosh and falls into the Guf, as it occurs in the %0a%3c second restriction, this has no effect on Bina herself, for she does not suffer %0a%3c from lack of the Light of Hochma whatsoever, as though she had never left the %0a%3c Rosh. This refers only to the Upper part of Bina, GAR de Bina, which has no %0a%3c desire for Hochma. This part is called AVI, and it spans from the Peh (mouth) %0a%3c down to the Chazeh (chest) of AA. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, ZAT de Bina, which wants to receive Hochma for ZON, just as a %0a%3c mother who wants to receive for her children, feels the exit from the Rosh of AA %0a%3c to its Guf, for there it cannot receive the Light of Hochma, but only the Light %0a%3c of Ruach-Nefesh, VAK of the Light. This part of Bina is called YESHSUT, and it %0a%3c spans from the Chazeh down to Tahur of AA. %0a%3c %0a%3c ZON of the world of Atzilut, which receive from YESHSUT, span from Tahur %0a%3c to the end of the feet of AA, on the Parsa. Thus, there are two Parsaot (plural for %0a%3c Parsa): one is in the world of Atzilut, separating the Sefirot of "bestowal" (GE) %0a%3c from the Sefirot of "reception" (AHP). This Parsa is located at the chest of AA. %0a%3c The second Parsa is located between Atzilut and BYA. However, we can also say %0a%3c that every Partzuf has its own Parsa, which separates the desires of bestowal from %0a%3c the desires of reception. %0a%3c %0a%3c Atik %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c AA %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ZON %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c YESHSUT = ZAT de Bina %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c AVI = GAR de Bina %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c PehH %0a%3c %0a%3c Rosh %0a%3c Peh— I- Chazeh- %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chazeh %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ■ Tabur %0a%3c Raglaim %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Raglaim %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Parsa %0a%3c %0a%3c of the World %0a%3c of Atzilut %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Parsa %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Beria %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Yetzira %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Assiya %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c This World %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Machsom %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 76 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Although GAR de Bina are positioned below the Rosh of AA, they are %0a%3c considered not to have left it, as they do not feel it, that is, they do not want %0a%3c Hochma; they wish only to bestow, and he who wants only to bestow feels %0a%3c perfection wherever he is. All the Partzufim and their parts that have nothing %0a%3c to do with reception of Hochma (Keter, Hochma, and GAR de Bina) separate %0a%3c themselves with a Parsa from the remaining parts of the world of Atzilut that %0a%3c want Hochma (ZAT de Bina and ZON). %0a%3c %0a%3c The "existence of the question" that The Zohar speaks of signifies the %0a%3c sensation of the lack of Light of Hochma, the desire for it. This is felt by ZON, %0a%3c which is why they raise MAN. MAN is a request of the lower one to receive %0a%3c the Light of Hochma from the Upper One for the Creator's sake. It is called %0a%3c a "question," for a question is similar to prayer or request. The Zohar tells us %0a%3c that the question exists only in YESHSUT, meaning that it receives MAN from %0a%3c below, from ZON. %0a%3c %0a%3c And before that, it is said of YESHSUT: BARAH (from the word Beria = BAR), %0a%3c something that exists outside of its degree. What did it do? BARAH (created) %0a%3c ELEH (AHP, ZON). However, it created them as headless as itself. For the word %0a%3c BARAH (beyond) indicates the lack of a Rosh (Kelim of the world of Atzilut). %0a%3c %0a%3c ZAT de Bina that wait for an "answer to their question," for the Light of %0a%3c Hochma, are called MI. It is said BARAH in regards to them because they exited %0a%3c and descended independently from the level of the Rosh de AA to below its %0a%3c Chazeh. These are ZAT de Bina, called YESHSUT or MI, the "Highest Edge of %0a%3c Heaven," for Heaven refers to ZA, who receives from YESHSUT. Malchut is %0a%3c called "earth." %0a%3c %0a%3c ZAT de Bina is called "firmament." %0a%3c %0a%3c ZA is called "Heaven." %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut is called "earth." %0a%3c %0a%3c All that exists below YESHSUT (ZON and the worlds of BYA) receives from %0a%3c it. Hence, it is considered that YESHSUT revives the whole of creation: whatever %0a%3c it has, they will receive it, too. However, their MAN determines whether or not %0a%3c YESHSUT will have something to bestow upon them. %0a%3c %0a%3c THERE LIES NO QUESTION in GAR de Bina (AVI). They do not receive %0a%3c MAN for the reception of Hochma, and they never feel any lack of Hochma, %0a%3c neither for themselves nor so as to give to others. Only ZATde Bina or YESHSUT %0a%3c are created and exist for the question, for the reception of MAN (ZON's plea). %0a%3c YESHSUT raises MAN that is received from ZON to the Rosh of AA and receives %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Who Created These %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 77 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c the Light of Hochma from there. YESHSLT is called the "Highest Edge of %0a%3c Heaven," for ZA, called "Heaven," receives from it. %0a%3c %0a%3c 8. But there is another one below, called MA. What is in common between %0a%3c this one and that one? The first one is concealed and is called MI. There exists %0a%3c a question in it for man to inquire and research in order to see and know all %0a%3c the degrees, down to the end of all degrees, which is Malchut. That is MA. %0a%3c What does MA mean? MA (what) do you know? What do you see? What do %0a%3c you research? After all, everything is initially concealed. %0a%3c %0a%3c Being in a state of Zivug PBP with ZA, Malchut is also called MA (like ZA) and %0a%3c is considered the lowest edge of Heaven, for she concludes all the degrees and %0a%3c Atzilut. ZA, called "Heaven," stands between Malchut (lowest edge of Heaven) %0a%3c and YESHSLT (Highest Edge of Heaven). %0a%3c %0a%3c MAN MUST INQUIRE, SEE, RESEARCH-only if one who is below %0a%3c ZON raises MAN (his prayer) to ZON will they raise this MAN higher. For ZON %0a%3c themselves are corrected by the Light of Hassadim, and do not want to receive %0a%3c the Light of Hochma. And only if a request comes from below, from man, will %0a%3c ZON ascend to YESHSLT and ask for the Light of Hochma. YESHSLT proceeds %0a%3c to raise MAN to AVI, and AVI raise MAN to AA: AVI ascend to the Rosh of AA, %0a%3c where there is the Light of Hochma, where they make a Zivug on this Light. %0a%3c %0a%3c A Zivug of AVI is called "Aha and Ima looking at each other." To "look" %0a%3c means to receive the Light of Hochma (to "hear" means to receive the Light of %0a%3c Hassadim). As a result of AVI's ascent to the Rosh of AA, Bina starts receiving %0a%3c Hochma for ZON. All the Partzufim of the world of Atzilut are corrected by the %0a%3c Light of Hassadim in such a way that they do not want to receive the Light of %0a%3c Hochma for themselves. %0a%3c %0a%3c He who is able to raise his request (MAN) to compel ZON to ascend to %0a%3c YESHS LT, whereupon YESHS LT and AVI will ascend to the Rosh of AA together %0a%3c so as to receive the Light for him— such a person is not simply considered a mere %0a%3c "person," but a "righteous"! %0a%3c %0a%3c The request that one raises to ZON is called one's "soul," for a soul is a %0a%3c vessel, a desire filled with Light. However, the Light inside a vessel is determinec %0a%3c by the desire. Hence, the spiritual desire, the intention to act for the Creator's %0a%3c sake is called "a soul." Naturally, if one does not yet have such an intention, he %0a%3c ot have a soul. %0a%3c %0a%3c The spiritual world is a world of only desires without any corporea %0a%3c hells. The reader must revise his ideas about the soul, body, connections %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 78 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c >rlds, etc., and correct himself continually so as to properly in %0a%3c ategories. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c So then, man's corrected desires are called "the souls of the righteous." %0a%3c These souls of the righteous ascend to ZON in the form of MAN and compel %0a%3c ZON to ascend to YESHSUT. The presence of ZON creates in YESHSUT a %0a%3c desire to receive the Light of Hochma. This compels YESHSUT (ZAT de Bina) to %0a%3c ascend to the Rosh of AA and there join with GAR de Bina (AVI) into one Partzuf. %0a%3c And then AVI (AB + SAG = AA + AVI) look at each other, exchange the Light of %0a%3c Hochma between them, and pass it down to ZON. %0a%3c %0a%3c Without a request from below, AVI will be satisfied with the Light of %0a%3c Hassadim and will not "look" at one another. Only the request of their children %0a%3c (ZON) compels AVI to face each other (Panim be Panim) and make a Zivug. In %0a%3c this Zivug, Ima-Bina receives the Light of Hochma for the children, ZON, from %0a%3c Aha-Hochma. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, this occurs BECAUSE MAN INQUIRED-man's question %0a%3c signifies the raising of MAN so as to make AVI look at each other, make a Zivug %0a%3c together, and let Ima receive Hochma from Aha for the man that is elevating his %0a%3c soul. The descending Light of Hochma is called knowledge or wisdom (Daat), %0a%3c for ZON ascend to YESHSUT + AVI, and there stimulate a Zivug on the Light %0a%3c of Hochma, called "knowledge." Hence, it is written in the Torah: "And Adam %0a%3c came to know his wife." %0a%3c %0a%3c Thus, to COME TO KNOW means to receive the Light of Hochma. ZON %0a%3c that stand in AVI and compel AVI to receive the Light of Hochma are called Daat %0a%3c (knowledge) or the Sefira Daat. %0a%3c %0a%3c Yet, Daat is not an additional Sefira. There are only ten Sefirot. However, in %0a%3c order to designate the fact that ZON's request for the Light of Hochma is inside %0a%3c the ten Sefirot of Partzuf AVI, we say that AVI have a Sefira called Daat. In this case, %0a%3c instead of the regular count of Sefirot: KHB-HGT-NHYM, we count the Sefirot: %0a%3c HBD-HGT-NHYM. The Sefira Keter is omitted, and we only mention the Sefira %0a%3c Daat after HochmaAba and Bina-lma. FROM ONE DEGREE TO ANOTHER %0a%3c signifies the passing of the Light of Hochma from the Sefira Daat of the degree of %0a%3c AVI to the degree of ZA. And TO THE END OF ALL DEGREES-from ZA to %0a%3c Malchut, which is called "the end of all degrees." %0a%3c %0a%3c When the Light is present in Nukva, she is called MA, and the Light that she %0a%3c passes to the lower ones is called 100 blessings. There are several states in Nukva, %0a%3c Malchut of the world of At^ilut. We need to know them, for all that we receive, %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Who Created These %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 79 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c we receive from her alone. In addition to all stages of growth from a point to a %0a%3c full Partzuf, a grown Malchut has two big states. %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut attains the first big state when she receives the Light of Neshama. %0a%3c This occurs when, due to her MAN, AVI ascend one degree from their %0a%3c permanent place to the Rosh of AA. However, although YESHSUT ascends from %0a%3c its permanent place between the chest (Chazeh) and the navel (Tabur) of AA to %0a%3c where AVI used to be (between the mouth and the chest of AA), it still remains %0a%3c clothed onto the Guf of AA, even though it merges into one Partzuf with AVI. %0a%3c %0a%3c And since YESHSUT now clothes the place from the mouth (Peh) to the %0a%3c Chazeh of AA from the outside, YESHSUT becomes like the Rosh of AA, as it %0a%3c merged with AVI in the Rosh of AA as one Partzuf. Also, YESHSUT ascends from %0a%3c under the Parsa of Atzilut in the Chazeh of AA and stands above it, where the %0a%3c Rosh of AA shines. %0a%3c %0a%3c That is why YESHSUT passes the Light of Hochma to ZA, and ZA passes %0a%3c it on to Malchut, who fills herself with this Light, called "100 blessings," for, %0a%3c having received this Light, ZON can ascend to the permanent place of YESHSUT %0a%3c between the Chazeh and the Tabur of AA. %0a%3c %0a%3c By ascending to this degree, Malchut becomes like Ima. In the spiritual %0a%3c world, the degree of a spiritual object determines all of its properties. Even %0a%3c in our world, the degree of man's inner development alone determines his %0a%3c properties, thoughts, and desires. And since Ima equals 100, Malchut, too, is %0a%3c called "100," so as to emphasize the fact that Malchut ascended to Bina of the %0a%3c world of Atzilut. %0a%3c %0a%3c Now Malchut is similar to MI just as YESHSUT was prior to raising MAN and %0a%3c passing the Light. This is because she now clothes the place of the small state of %0a%3c YESHSUT from the Chazeh to the Tabur of AA, and stands under the Parsa of the %0a%3c world of Atzilut, below which the Light from the Rosh de AA cannot pass. %0a%3c %0a%3c That is why Malchut gained no Light, for the sake of which she had raised %0a%3c MAN. Nevertheless, Malchut gains by receiving the properties of Ima-Bina, for %0a%3c she ascended to YESHSUT, called Ima. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, the Light that Malchut received is only considered VAK of the Gadlut %0a%3c state, the first state of Gadlut. Malchut will not be able to receive the GAR of %0a%3c Gadlut, the second Gadlut, the Light of Hochma (Haya), as long as she is under %0a%3c the Parsa of Atzilut in the Chazeh of AA. (How Malchut receives GAR of the %0a%3c Gadlut is explained in items 11 through 15 in the next article). %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 80 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar calls Nukva that ascended to YESHSUT by the word MA (from %0a%3c the word Me'ah— 100), for by means of this ascent, Malchut gained the properties %0a%3c of Bina—100 blessings. And she gained the sensation of the question— she feels %0a%3c that it has only VAK (a half, a part of the big state). Put differently, she feels the %0a%3c desire for its second half, GAR. Nevertheless, she gained a part of the big state, %0a%3c VAK of AVI. %0a%3c %0a%3c Thus, Nukva became like YESHSUT before it raised MAN, but gained the %0a%3c properties of Bina, 100 blessings. And since this is VAK of the Light of the big %0a%3c state, she feels a deficiency (a question), just as YESHSUT felt prior to raising %0a%3c MAN— at its place, when YESHSUT was in the Katnut state. When it ascended %0a%3c to AVI, AVI ascended to AA, and ZON ascended to the place of YESHSUT AVI %0a%3c shine from the Rosh of AA on the place of YESHSUT ZON that stand there now %0a%3c feel the Light that they receive from AVI, and realize that this is merely a part of %0a%3c the Light, which generates another question within them. %0a%3c %0a%3c 9. This is the secret defined by the word MA: WHAT do you testify and %0a%3c WHAT is equal to you? When the Temple was destroyed, a voice came forth %0a%3c and said, "What (MA) shall I indicate to you, and what (MA) shall I equate %0a%3c to you?" (Eicha, 2:13). However, here MA means, "What is the covenant, %0a%3c testimony, what (MA) is equal to you?" For every day testifies to you the days %0a%3c of past, as it is said: "This day I call onto Heaven and earth to witness for you" %0a%3c (Devarim, 30:19). WHAT is equal to you? It is said: "I adorned you with holy %0a%3c adornments and made you ruler of the world." And it is said: "Is this the %0a%3c city that men called the quintessence of beauty?" {Eicha, 2:15). I have called %0a%3c you, "Jerusalem, a city rebuilt by me" (Tehilim, 122:3). "What shall I equate %0a%3c to you?" (Eicha, 2:13). Just as you sit here, so He sits Above in Supernal %0a%3c Jerusalem. Just as the holy nation does not enter into you, so I swear to you %0a%3c that I will not enter Above until I enter you down below. And this is your %0a%3c consolation— that I will equate you with this degree, with Supernal Jerusalem, %0a%3c which is the Supernal Malchut (Hebrew - Kingdom) that rules over all. But %0a%3c for now you are here, and "Your misery is great, like the sea" (Eicha, 2:13). %0a%3c And if you say that there is no existence or salvation for you, then WHO (MI) %0a%3c shall heal you (not Who? with a question mark, but the Upper Force called %0a%3c WHO is what will heal you), that is, that same concealed Upper Degree, which %0a%3c is called MI, Bina that revives all, shall heal and revive you. %0a%3c %0a%3c In other words, MA and MI, besides being translated as WHAT and WHO, %0a%3c also designate the names of spiritual objects that perform actions described %0a%3c in The Zohar. The destruction of the Temple was the consequence of Israel's %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Who Created These %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 81 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c transgression of egoistic reception, because they did not want to raise MAN %0a%3c for the Zivug of ZON, and instead wished to receive the Light into the impure %0a%3c forces, their egoistic desires, called "other gods" (Elokim Acherim). There is %0a%3c only one Creator. %0a%3c %0a%3c There is but one property for the Creator, and we know it— the property %0a%3c of bestowal. Drawing closer to this property is defined as working "for the %0a%3c Creator's sake." Any other desire can only mean distancing from this property %0a%3c and from the Creator, for except for this property or its opposite (rather, its %0a%3c absence), nothing else exists in creation. Hence, man's inner movement towarc %0a%3c the property of "reception" pushes him away from the Creator, and is there %0a%3c called "worshipping other gods." As a result, ZON stopped their Zivug, the %0a%3c blessings disappeared from Nukva, and the Temple was ruined. %0a%3c %0a%3c The First Temple— Malchut ascended to AVI and there receives the Light of %0a%3c Haya. Its ruin is the fall of Malchut to the level of reception of the Light GAR %0a%3c de Ruach. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Second Temple is Malchut 's ascension to YESHSUT and the reception %0a%3c of the Light of Neshama. In its ruin, Malchut fell to the level of reception of the %0a%3c Light of Nefesh in her Sefira Keter, while the other nine Sefirot fall below the %0a%3c Parsa. Such a state is called Galut— exile from the spiritual, from the world of %0a%3c Atzilut. The single Sefira Malchut in the world of Atzilut remains as a point below %0a%3c the Sefira Yesod of ZA. %0a%3c %0a%3c ZA is called "six days" and Malchut is called Shahhat (Saturday). Yet, is Malchut %0a%3c really bigger than ZA, as Shahhat is bigger (higher) than weekdays? The worlds %0a%3c of BYA, including our world, receive the Light, their life-force, from Malchut. %0a%3c The "six weekdays" are a state of ZON when ZA and Malchut are unconnected %0a%3c to one another. Shabbat is a state of ZON when Malchut joins with ZA, a Zivug %0a%3c takes place between them, and Malchut receives the Light from ZA and passes it %0a%3c on to the whole world. %0a%3c %0a%3c Since the state of Malchut when she passes the Light received from ZA down %0a%3c to the world is important to us, by measuring our states in accordance with what %0a%3c we receive from Malchut, we define the extent of maximal reception as Shahhat. %0a%3c (Naturally, this has nothing to do with our calendar: weekdays and Shabbat are %0a%3c spiritual states that transcend time). %0a%3c %0a%3c AND A VOICE CAME FORTH AND SAID: "EACH AND EVERY DAY %0a%3c MY COVENANT HAS BEEN IN YOU SINCE THE DAYS OF PAST"- %0a%3c here, The Zohar speaks of the Light of VAK that ZON receive in the state of %0a%3c Gadlut, which Nukva receives as MA. This Light is called "the past days" (Yamim %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 82 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Kadmonim). Therefore, it is written in the Torah (Devarim, 4:32): "Ask now of %0a%3c the past days, which were before you, since the day the Creator created man, %0a%3c from one edge of Heaven unto the other, whether there has been any such thing %0a%3c as great as this?..." %0a%3c %0a%3c The Light of VAK of the Gadlut state is called in ZON "the past days," for %0a%3c it is VAK of AVI. YESHSUT is ZAT of AVI. ZAT is an abbreviation of the words %0a%3c Zayin (7), and Tachtonot (lower, meaning the lower Sefirot). ZAT of AVI, meaning %0a%3c the seven Sefirot of Partzuf AVI, is YESHSUT. These Zayin are seven days, the %0a%3c seven primary Sefirot of AVI with regard to Zayin, the seven days or the seven %0a%3c Sefirot of ZON. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, it is written, "MY COVENANT EACH AND EVERY DAY BY %0a%3c HEAVEN AND EARTH" (Devarim, 4:26). These words of the Torah speak of %0a%3c the Zivug of ZON called "Heaven" (ZA) and "earth" (Nukva). "The past days" %0a%3c or "Supernal Days" constitute YESHSUT, and "the low days" or "the present %0a%3c days" are ZON. %0a%3c %0a%3c In this sentence, the Creator cautions that the Zivug of ZON needs to be %0a%3c constantly realized and maintained. Otherwise, the Creator warns that "you will %0a%3c disappear from the earth." And this is the meaning of the Creator's warning %0a%3c about the 100 blessings: they should be guarded and constantly created. %0a%3c %0a%3c For these 100 blessings that Nukva receives from ZA every day in the Zivug of %0a%3c MA between them take place during the ascent of ZON to YESHSUT, when ZA %0a%3c becomes like YeshS (Israel-Saba) and Nukva becomes like T (Tvunah). YESHSUT %0a%3c stands for Israel-Saba and Tvunah. And then, the Light that Nukva receives from %0a%3c ZA becomes 100 blessings, like the Light in Tvunah. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is said about it, "the city that united with her," for Nukva, called "city," %0a%3c merged with Tvunah, and Nukva became like Tvunah. And Nukva receives in %0a%3c Tvunah the Light oi Tvunah, called "holy adornments," and then, like a crown of %0a%3c beauty, she surrounds the earth and receives power over the earth. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, as a result of Israel's transgressions (the rise of impure desires %0a%3c over the pure ones), the Temple is ruined (the Light disappeared), and Israel %0a%3c is banished from its land (fell to lower degrees). This led to the distancing of %0a%3c Nukva (all creatures) from ZA (the Creator), for the lower nine Sefirot (desires) of %0a%3c Nukva fell to the impure forces (became egoistic). In other words, the nine pure, %0a%3c altruistic desires (forces) lost their screen and became egoistic, and Nukva herself %0a%3c turned into a point that stands below the Sefira Yesod of ZA. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, it is written: "WHO SHALL REBUILD YOU AND HEAL YOU"- %0a%3c if the sons of Israel return in their aspirations to the Creator (to altruism), called %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Who Created These %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 83 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c "the return," correct their deeds (desires), and raise their prayers (MAN) for help %0a%3c in their correction to the Creator in ZON, they will once more be able to receive %0a%3c the Upper Light in ZON, Nukva will rise again to YESHSUT, called MI, and will %0a%3c be healed thereby (the Upper Light will enter Malchut, the souls, and will impart %0a%3c its properties onto them). %0a%3c %0a%3c 10. MI-WHO sets the boundary of Heaven Above— YESHSUT. MA- %0a%3c WHAT sets the boundary of Heaven below— ZA and Malchut. And this is %0a%3c what Yaakov inherited, as he is ZA that shines from end to end. From one %0a%3c boundary, which is MI, to the other boundary, which is MA. For he, Yaakov, %0a%3c stands in the middle, between YESHSUT and Malchut. Hence, it is said, %0a%3c MI BARAH ELEH: MI is YESHSUT, BARAH means created, and ELEH %0a%3c stands for ZA and Malchut. %0a%3c %0a%3c Actually, it should rather be written, "from the beginning, i.e., from the %0a%3c Height of Heaven down to its end (lowest point) below." Yet it says, "from the %0a%3c boundary of Heaven." MI is YESHSUT that upholds everything with its question, %0a%3c the desire to receive the Light for ZON. MA is Nulcva. Before Nulcva raises MAN, %0a%3c she is the very last degree, standing below the Chazeh of ZA. Between YESHSUT %0a%3c and Nulcva stands Yaakov— ZA that clothes AA from Tabur to Malchut of AA. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Creator %0a%3c %0a%3c The World of AK %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The World of Atzilut %0a%3c %0a%3c (Atik inside of AA is unattainable) %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Parsa %0a%3c %0a%3c of the World %0a%3c of Atzilut %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 9 %0a%3c %0a%3c lower %0a%3c Sefirot %0a%3c of Malchut %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The World of Beria %0a%3c The World of Yetzira %0a%3c The World of Assiya %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Parsa %0a%3c %0a%3c of the Worlds %0a%3c ABYA %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c This World %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 84 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Arich Anpin is the central Partzuf in the world of Atzilut. Since Atik is %0a%3c unattainable, everything comes from AA, and all the Partzufim of the world of %0a%3c Atzilut clothe it (receive from it): Rosh de AA towers over all, and no one can %0a%3c clothe it, meaning no one can attain its thoughts and reasons for its actions. %0a%3c %0a%3c The next Partzuf is AVI. AVI clothe (attain) AA from Peh to Chazeh. Below AVI %0a%3c stands Partzuf YESHSUT, clothing AA from Chazeh to Tahur. ZA stands below %0a%3c YESHSLT and clothes AA from Tahur downwards. Partzuf ZA is incomplete, as %0a%3c he has only six Sefirot HBD-HGT or VAK; he is in the Katnut state, ending with %0a%3c his Sefira Tifferet (his Chazeh). %0a%3c %0a%3c Nukm (Malchut) stands below ZA, or parallel to his last Sefira Tifferet (the %0a%3c Chazeh of ZA). She has only one Sefira Keter, whereas her nine other Sefirot %0a%3c fell below the Parsa to the worlds BYA. The entire world of Atzilut ends at %0a%3c the Chazeh of ZA, where the single Sefira of Malchut stands, who is therefore %0a%3c called a point. %0a%3c %0a%3c In our world, there is desire and its physical manifestation— action. For %0a%3c example, one wants to receive something, but he does not allow himself to %0a%3c perform the physical act of taking. Meanwhile, his desire to take remains the %0a%3c same. In the spiritual world, there are no bodies, only bare desires. Therefore, %0a%3c the desire itself already constitutes action, like an already completed mental %0a%3c and physical action in our world. Therefore, the desire alone determines man's %0a%3c spiritual state. %0a%3c %0a%3c Just imagine what it would be like if in our world we judged a person not by %0a%3c his actions, but by his desires! It is terrifying to think how distant we are from %0a%3c spiritual demands. However, our desires are determined by our spiritual degree. %0a%3c And The Zohar explains that only by raising MAN (the request for correctic %0a%3c can we attract onto us the flow of Upper Light, which will correct and elevate %0a%3c to a Higher Degree. And we will immediately begii %0a%3c that degree will evoke within us. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, our task is to attain the desire for correction. To this end, we %0a%3c need a "question," perception of our state as intolerable. This is called the %0a%3c realization of evil, i.e., that our egoism is evil, that it brings me harm by severing %0a%3c me from the spiritual. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, in order for this to happen, we need %0a%3c little bit of what the spiritual is and how good it is. Evil %0a%3c contrast with good. Yet, how can we sense the spiritual if we have yet to %0a%3c egoism? In what Kelim (desires) can we sense this? Even though we lack corrected %0a%3c desires, and therefore cannot sense the spiritual, as a result of studying Kabbalah, %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Who Created These %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 85 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c one begins to sense the Surrounding Light, which bestows onto him the desire %0a%3c for the spiritual (See "Introduction to the Study of the Ten Sefirot," item 155). %0a%3c %0a%3c The desire of one who physically exists in our world, but spiritually exists %0a%3c in the worlds of BYA— is a desire to enjoy the Light. However, opposite these %0a%3c desires one has an "anti-desire," a screen, which neutralizes his innate will to %0a%3c receive pleasure. %0a%3c %0a%3c A screen is created (appears, emerges, born) within the Kli (desire, man) as a %0a%3c result of man's sensation of the spiritual Light (the Creator). Therefore, all our %0a%3c requests (prayers, MAN, "questions") should be about one thing only: for the %0a%3c Creator to grant us the strength necessary to ascend spiritually, to transform our %0a%3c desires or, as Kabbalah defines it, to acquire a screen. It is impossible to annul %0a%3c one's will to receive pleasure. The Creator created it, and it is His only creation. %0a%3c All we can do is acquire a screen (counterbalance) on it, thereby ascending above %0a%3c creation (egoism), and become similar to the Creator! And to the extent of this %0a%3c similarity, to merge with him. %0a%3c %0a%3c Thus, Partzuf Yaakov stands from MI (YESHSUT) to MA (Malchut), from %0a%3c end to end. However, what is referred to here is the state of ZON, when they %0a%3c ascend to YESHSUT and receive the Light of its degree. %0a%3c %0a%3c The entire spiritual distance from us to the Creator is divided into 125 %0a%3c invisible degrees, all of them named. These degrees differ from one another %0a%3c only by the magnitude of their screen on man's egoistic desires. Man receives %0a%3c the Light in his corrected, altruistic desires. The volume of the received Light %0a%3c depends on the screen's magnitude (the size of the desire's corrected part). %0a%3c %0a%3c Every degree is characterized by a particular sensation of the Creator, and %0a%3c this sensation is called Light. Hence, we can designate the spiritual state of the %0a%3c Kli (man) in the spiritual world by the name of its degree or the name of the %0a%3c Light it receives, as every degree has its own particular Light. These gradations of %0a%3c the sensation of the Creator are precisely what we call spiritual degrees. %0a%3c %0a%3c That is why, having ascended to a degree called YESHSUT, ZON receive %0a%3c the Light of YESHSUT, although Partzuf YESHSUT itself ascended, accordingly, %0a%3c to a Higher Degree, and there receives the Light of that degree, called AVI. In %0a%3c turn, AVI ascend to a degree called AA, where they receive the Light of AA. We %0a%3c call degrees by the names of the Partzufim that abide there in their usual, lowest %0a%3c state. Such a state is called permanent. %0a%3c %0a%3c Even though by ascending to a Higher Degree, the lower Partzuf receives %0a%3c the Light of that degree, which changes its properties, the Partzuf remains itself %0a%3c nonetheless, just as a person who acquires new properties remains a person, %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 86 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c though now one of another level. Therefore, when it is said, "having ascended %0a%3c to the Upper One, the lower one becomes like him," it implies a change only in %0a%3c the inner properties of man (or Partzuf), but not in his identity. %0a%3c %0a%3c Upon ascending to YESHSUT, ZA receives greater Light, for an ascent %0a%3c in the spiritual world signifies an increase in the magnitude of a screen, and, %0a%3c accordingly, reception of greater Light. That is to say, ZA himself grew, but did %0a%3c not turn into YESHSUT: previously, at his own place, he had only the Light %0a%3c Ruach-Nefesh, but upon ascending and acquiring a screen, he receives the Light %0a%3c of Neskama as well. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, all the places between us and the Creator are established, and %0a%3c the Partzufim that are there "stand" on them in their permanent place. However, %0a%3c all the Partzufim and the worlds can ascend relative to their permanent, lowest %0a%3c states by one, two, or three degrees. In its lowest state, a Partzuf has only GE and %0a%3c no AHP, and only the Light of Nefesh-Ruach. %0a%3c %0a%3c By receiving the Light of correction from Above, the Partzuf can gradually %0a%3c correct its AHP: it corrects the Sefira Bina and receives the Light of Neshama, %0a%3c which designates an ascent of one degree. After that, the Partzuf corrects %0a%3c the Sefira ZA, and receives the Light of Haya, which designates an ascent %0a%3c to another degree, i.e., already two degrees. And after that, it corrects Sefira %0a%3c Malchut and receives the Light of Yechida, which designates an ascent to yet %0a%3c another degree, a third one. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Hochma = Eynaim %0a%3c Parsa, Nikvey Eynaim, Masach of Partzuf %0a%3c %0a%3c Bina = Awzen ( ascen t of Bina to GE = ascent by 1 degree) %0a%3c ZA =Hotem (ascent of ZA to GE = ascent by 2 degrees) %0a%3c Malchut = Peh (ascent of Malchut to GE = ascent by 3 degrees) %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c However, the new Light does not enter the just corrected Kli (Sefira), but %0a%3c comes from Above and enters through the Sefira Keter. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Who Created These %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 87 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c SEFIRA %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c LIGHT %0a%3c %0a%3c Yechida %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Haya %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Neshama %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Ruach %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Nefesh %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Keter %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c l« %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Hochma %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Bina %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c AHP %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ZA %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Man's spiritual ascent can be the consequence of two factors: %0a%3c %0a%3c 1. An awakening of a desire from Above, called "special days"— holidays, %0a%3c new moons, Sabbaths. This kind of an ascent is called "an awakening %0a%3c from Above," and leads to the general ascent of all the worlds ABYA, %0a%3c and, consequently, of all that inhabits them. %0a%3c %0a%3c 2. Man's efforts in his studies and inner work, his prayer to merit the Cre- %0a%3c ator personally giving him the strength to ascend to a Higher Degree. %0a%3c %0a%3c Moreover, such an ascent is not limited to only three degrees, but can elevate %0a%3c man along all 125 degrees to the Creator Himself. Ascension to the Highest %0a%3c Degree is precisely the purpose for which man was created. He must accomplish %0a%3c this task while still living in this world. And until he attains this goal, he will %0a%3c have to return to this world again and again. %0a%3c %0a%3c Although ZON are called "the last days," upon ascending and receiving the %0a%3c Light of YESHSLT, they receive the name "the days past or first days." In this %0a%3c instance, one boundary of Heaven (Malchut or MA) ascends and clothes the %0a%3c other boundary of Heaven (YESHSUT or MI). MA and MI merge in one, and %0a%3c The Zohar emphasizes that fact. AND KNOW: %0a%3c %0a%3c Ml - WHO %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BARAH - CREATED %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ELEH - THIS %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 88 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c MI is YESHSUT that stands in the place of Bina de AA, from Chazeh to Tabur %0a%3c de AA. And although only Kelim of GE (vessels of bestowal) are present in the %0a%3c world of Atzilut, there are Partzufirn among them that wish only to "bestow": %0a%3c Atik, AA, AVI, and those that want to receive for the sake of bestowal, so as to %0a%3c pass the Light on to YESHSUT and ZON. %0a%3c %0a%3c World of Atzilut %0a%3c Atik %0a%3c %0a%3c AA > These 3 Partzufirn form GE of the World of Atzilut %0a%3c %0a%3c AVI %0a%3c %0a%3c Parsa of the World of Atzilut %0a%3c %0a%3c YESHSUT %0a%3c %0a%3c ZA ) These 3 Partzufirn form AHP of the World of Atzilut %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c YESHSUT and ZON want to receive the Light so as to pass it to the souls of %0a%3c the righteous, the people who seek correction. Hence, within the world of Atzilut %0a%3c there is a division into two types of Kelim— GE and AHP. They are separated from %0a%3c each other by the Parsa of the world of Atzilut that stands in the Chazeh of AA. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c World of Atzilut %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Atik %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ZON %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c YESHSUT %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c AVI %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c AA %0a%3c Rosh %0a%3c -Peh — %0a%3c %0a%3c Chazeh - %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c -Tabur — %0a%3c Raglaim %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Parsa %0a%3c %0a%3c of the World %0a%3c of Atzilut %0a%3c %0a%3c Parsa between %0a%3c Atzilut and the %0a%3c Worlds BYA %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Light from the Rosh de AA does not pass below the Parsa of the world of %0a%3c Atzilut. Therefore, YESHSUT in its permanent state, or ZON, when they ascend %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Who Created These %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 89 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c to YESHSUT, cannot receive the Light of Rosh de AA. This is why they have the %0a%3c desire to receive the Light of Hochma, called "question." The question (desire %0a%3c to receive the Light of Hochma) therefore amounts to MI (YESHSUT, the Light %0a%3c of YESHSUT), which is BARAH (beyond ELEH-ZON), and upon their ascent, %0a%3c ZON do not receive the Light of Hochma, as they are outside the Rosh of AA, %0a%3c outside of the Light of Hochma, but with a question (a desire for it). This enables %0a%3c them to continue their ascent. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Who Created These (by Eliyahu) %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 11. Rabbi Shimon said: "Elazar, my son, reveal the supernal secret, which %0a%3c the dwellers of this world know nothing about." Rabbi Elazar was silent. %0a%3c Rabbi Shimon wept and paused for a moment, and then said, "Elazar, what %0a%3c is ELEH?" If you say that they are like the stars and the signs of the zodiac %0a%3c (destiny), are they not always visible (unlike the changeable signs of destiny)? %0a%3c And in MA, that is in Malchut, they were created as it is written, "By the %0a%3c word of the Creator were the Heavens made" (Tehilim, 33:6), meaning that %0a%3c the Heavens were made by Mcdchut, called the Creator's word. And if ELEH %0a%3c speak of the hidden secrets, then there would be no need to write ELEH, as %0a%3c the stars and the signs of destinies are visible to all (the word ELEH (THIS) %0a%3c tells us that something is clear). %0a%3c %0a%3c Rabbi Elazar did not reveal the reception of the Light of the first Gadlut %0a%3c state (Ohr Neshama), and Rabbi Shimon wished to reveal the way to receive the %0a%3c Light of the second Gadlut state (Ohr Haya). Therefore, he asked Rabbi Elazar %0a%3c to speak and to reveal the way to attain Ohr Neshama, which is concealed from %0a%3c people by a supernal secret, for this Light has not yet been revealed in the world, %0a%3c and Rabbi Shimon reveals it here. %0a%3c %0a%3c The fact is that, although there were righteous who attained the Light of %0a%3c Haya, there was no one among them who could explain the path of its attainment %0a%3c in detail, no one who could reveal it to the entire world. This is so because to %0a%3c understand means to attain, to ascend to that degree, which depends only on %0a%3c man's efforts. While there were many people throughout the generations who %0a%3c attained the degree of ELEH, revealing it to the world requires an even greater %0a%3c degree, and a special permission by the Creator (See the article The Conditions %0a%3c for Disclosing the Secrets of the Wisdom of Kabbalah). %0a%3c %0a%3c Rabbi Shimon asked him what ELEH means, what new things is the Torah %0a%3c telling us with the words, MI BARAH ELEH (WHO CREATED THESE), where %0a%3c %0a%3c 91 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 92 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c the word ELEH designates ZON? After all, if it speaks of the stars and the signs %0a%3c of the zodiac— luck, which signify the Light of VAK of the big state, then what %0a%3c is so special about it? After all, ZON can receive this Light even on weekdays. %0a%3c There is nothing so extraordinary in this to mention MI - WHO CREATED %0a%3c THIS separately. %0a%3c %0a%3c (One might say that this Light is constant, for only the Light of VAK is %0a%3c constantly present in ZON, but not GAR. And only as a result of MAN does %0a%3c ZON receive the Light of VAK of the big state, the Light of Neshama. The answer %0a%3c lies in that this Light can be received at any time, even on weekdays during the %0a%3c morning prayer. However, he still does not understand why these were created %0a%3c in MA. After all, Light refers not to Bina, but to the ZON of the world of At^ilut, %0a%3c called MA, and exits them, as is written BY THE WORD OF THE CREATOR, %0a%3c where the Creator is ZA and His word is Malchut.) %0a%3c %0a%3c 12. However, this secret was revealed on another day, when I was on the %0a%3c seashore. The prophet Eliyahu came to me and said: "Rabbi, do you know %0a%3c the meaning of MI BARAH ELEH - WHO HAS CREATED THESE?" I %0a%3c answered: "These are the Heavens and its forces, the works of the Creator, %0a%3c looking at which, people should bless Him, as it is said, 'When I behold Your %0a%3c Heavens, the work of Your hands' (Tehilim, 8:4), and 'O LORD! Our Lord! %0a%3c How glorious is Your name throughout all the earth!'" (Tehilim, 8:10). %0a%3c %0a%3c 13. He replied to me: "Rabbi, the Creator took the concealed and revealed it %0a%3c to the Celestial Council. And here it is: When the most Concealed of all that %0a%3c are Concealed desired to reveal Himself, He first made a single point, which %0a%3c is Mcdchut, and it ascended to His Thought, that is, into Bina, meaning that %0a%3c MalcHwt ascended and merged with Bina. In her, He shaped all the creatures, %0a%3c and in her confirmed all the laws." %0a%3c %0a%3c Atilc is the first Partzuf and the Rosh of the world of Atzilut. And it is called %0a%3c the most concealed and secret of all the Partzufim, and its name— Atilc (from the %0a%3c word Ne'etok— isolated, unattainable) testifies to that fact. No one can attain %0a%3c this Partzuf in itself, its properties, but we can attain it the way it appears to %0a%3c us: Atilc deliberately diminishes and changes itself in such a way that the lower %0a%3c ones could attain the outer form (its properties) in which it appears to them, %0a%3c but not Atilc itself. %0a%3c %0a%3c In the words of The Zohar, when Atilc wished to reveal itself to the worlds, %0a%3c although it is a Partzuf that acts according to the laws of the first restriction, it %0a%3c "clothed itself in the garments" (an external Partzuf that acts according to the %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Who Created These (by Eliyahu) %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 93 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c laws of the second restriction) with regard to the lower ones so as to enable them %0a%3c to perceive and attain it. %0a%3c %0a%3c There is an enormous difference between the properties of the sensory %0a%3c organs that perceive sensations of the first and the second restrictions. Just as %0a%3c man in our world is born without sensory organs that can perceive spiritual %0a%3c worlds, which is why he cannot sense them, so is the Partzuf that is corrected %0a%3c for the conditions of spiritual work at the level of the second restriction unable %0a%3c to accept (perceive) the Light that descends according to the law of the first %0a%3c restriction. A similar distinction exists between Partzuf Atik and the other %0a%3c Partzufim of the world of Atzilut and the worlds of BYA. %0a%3c %0a%3c To be connected to the lower ones, Atik elevated Malchut de Rosh de AA %0a%3c within the Rosh of the lower-standing AA up to the Sefira Hochma. As a result, %0a%3c Sefirot Bina and ZON de Rosh de AA fell from the Rosh of AA to its Guf. After %0a%3c all, Malchut ascended from the Peh to the Eynaim and stood in the Rosh at place %0a%3c of Bina, whereas Bina and ZON exited the Rosh. The Guf (body) begins after %0a%3c Malchut de Rosh (after the decision on how to act), wherever it may be. %0a%3c %0a%3c Here is how one should understand this: the Sefirot of the Rosh are the %0a%3c thoughts and desires with regards to which the Partzuf, man's inner properties %0a%3c (man himself) makes the decisions as to how they can be used in order to advance %0a%3c as much as possible toward the goal of creation. The fact that Sefirot Bina and %0a%3c ZON exited the Rosh of AA means that Partzuf AA cannot make any decisions %0a%3c with regard to them for lack of a screen on them. This is why they fell into the %0a%3c Guf, outside the Rosh. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, their remaining role is only to receive the Light from the Rosh, just %0a%3c as it is received by all the Sefirot of the Guf. In other words, they receive the Light %0a%3c that is accepted by the screen of Sefirot Keter and Hochma that remained in the %0a%3c Rosh. Man deliberately restricts the use of his desires, and uses only those desires %0a%3c with which he can work for the Creator's sake. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, when Malchut ascended and stood under the Sefira Hochma, %0a%3c Hochma became like the male part (bestowing, fulfilling), and Malchut became %0a%3c like the female (receiving) part of the Rosh. And since Malchut took the place of %0a%3c Bina (called "thought"), Malchut assumed the name "thought," since now it's %0a%3c Malchut that makes a Zivug and receives Ohr Hochma. %0a%3c %0a%3c A Partzuf that receives from Hochma is defined as Bina, and not Malchut. %0a%3c Therefore, although Malchut herself is merely a black point (egoistic creature), as %0a%3c a result of her ascent, she becomes Bina, i.e., Malchut acquires Bina's properties. %0a%3c Hence, Malchut is now called Bina or "thought." %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 94 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar calls a "thought" either to Hochma or to Bina. The difference is %0a%3c that a thought is something that is received from Hochma. Hence, Bina is called %0a%3c a thought only if she is in the Rosh and receives the Light from Hochma. In %0a%3c the first restriction, Bina always receives from Hochma, and is called "thought." %0a%3c However, in the second restriction, Malchut ascended above Bina and started %0a%3c receiving from Hochma. That is why it is Malchut that is now called "thought," %0a%3c and not Bina. %0a%3c %0a%3c All the Partzufim of the worlds of ABYA are created by this ascent of Malchut %0a%3c to Bina. Therefore, it is written: IN HER HE SHAPED ALL THE CREATURES, %0a%3c AND IN HER CONFIRMED ALL THE LAWS-Se/irot Keter and Hochma %0a%3c remained in the Rosh of each Partzuf, and a Zivug was made on these two Sefirot. %0a%3c This is why the Light received in Guf of the Partzuf consists of only two Lights, %0a%3c Ne/esh and Ruach. %0a%3c %0a%3c Previously, Malchut stood in Peh de Rosh and the Rosh (the part of the Partzuf %0a%3c in which it calculated how much Light it can receive for the Creator's sake) %0a%3c ended there. Then, the Partzuf would receive that Light from the Rosh to the %0a%3c Guf, between the Peh and the Tahur. %0a%3c %0a%3c But now Malchut ascended to Eynaim de Rosh and stands under them. This %0a%3c is known as the ascent of Malchut to NE (Nikvey Eynaim - pupils of the eyes), %0a%3c which are called NE precisely because Nikvey Eynaim means Malchut of the eyes. %0a%3c Prior to Malchut's ascent to the Eynaim, it was as though there were no pupils %0a%3c (NE). It is worth noting that only in Malchut (desire) can we feel what surrounds %0a%3c us (the Creator, Light). This is why all of our sensory organs are designed as %0a%3c apertures: Nekev (orifice), Nukva, Malchut in the eyes, Awznaim (ears), Hotem %0a%3c (nose) and Peh (mouth). %0a%3c %0a%3c Only he who can create desires that work according to the principle of the %0a%3c second restriction through his own strength and effort, and puts Malchut after %0a%3c er-Hochma (thinks in terms of bestowal), can start perceiving through tl %0a%3c ted spiritual sensory organ. Wherever there is a screen, it constitutes %0a%3c %0a%3c Upon her ascent, Malchut stood under Hochma and made a Zivug on her %0a%3c own screen, on Sefirot Keter-Hochma (GE). Sefirot Bina-ZA-Malchut (AHP) are %0a%3c located below the Rosh, in the Guf of the Partzuf, and passively receive the Light %0a%3c from the Rosh. This leads to a division of the ten Sefirot of the Guf, KHB-ZA-M, %0a%3c in the same way the ten Sefirot of the Rosh were divided: Sefirot K-H of the Guf %0a%3c continue receiving from K-H of the Rosh, and Sefirot B-ZA-M of the Guf, being %0a%3c unable to receive from the Rosh, start receiving from K-H of the Guf, like the %0a%3c Sefirot below the Tahur of the Partzuf. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Who Created These (by Eliyahu) %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 95 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c As is well-known, every Partzuf consists of a Rosh, a Guf, and extremities. %0a%3c The Rosh decides how much Light the Guf can receive for the Creator's sake, in %0a%3c accordance with the magnitude of the screen that reflects the Light (pleasure). %0a%3c The decision to accept this Light causes the Light to descend through the screen, %0a%3c from the Rosh to the Guf, filling it from the Peh down to the Tahur. Each Sefira %0a%3c of the Rosh fills its corresponding Sefira in the Guf. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Partzuf in the 1 st Restriction %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Keter %0a%3c Hochma %0a%3c Bina %0a%3c ZA %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 5 Parts of the Head %0a%3c Mouth %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Keter %0a%3c Hochma %0a%3c Bina %0a%3c ZA %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 5 Parts of the Body %0a%3c Tabur %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Keter %0a%3c Hochma %0a%3c Bina %0a%3c ZA %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 5 Parts of the Extremities %0a%3c Feet %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Partzuf in the 2 nd Restriction %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Keter %0a%3c Hochma %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Mouth %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 2 Parts of the Head %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Bina %0a%3c ZA %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Keter %0a%3c Hochma %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 2 Parts of the Body %0a%3c %0a%3c Tabur %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Bina %0a%3c ZA %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Keter %0a%3c Hochma %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 2 Parts of the Extremities %0a%3c Feet %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Bina %0a%3c ZA %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Parts outside of Partzuf %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 96 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c If there are only two Sefirot K-H in the Rosh, then only the two Sefirot K-H %0a%3c remain in the Guf. This is because only they can receive from the corresponding %0a%3c Sefirot in the Rosh. Sefirot B-ZA-M of the Rosh receive the same Light as Sefirot K-H %0a%3c of the Guf, which means that they are located under the screen (Malchut that %0a%3c ascends and stands under Hochma de Rosh). Thus, the Guf contains K-H that %0a%3c receive, accordingly, the Lights Ruach-Nefesh, and AHP of the Rosh that receive %0a%3c these two Lights of Ruach-Nefesh, too. %0a%3c %0a%3c B-ZA-M (AHP) of the Guf cannot receive the Light from the Rosh, as their %0a%3c corresponding Sefirot B-ZA-M of the Rosh do not participate in a Zivug, since they %0a%3c lack the strength of the screen sufficient to reflect the egoistic desires of AHP %0a%3c de Rosh so as to receive for the Creator's sake. In other words, since there are %0a%3c no AHP in the Rosh, there are also no AHP in the Guf. And since AHP de Guf %0a%3c receive no Light from AHP de Rosh, they are like the extremities— the end of a %0a%3c Partzuf, below its Tabur. Hence, at the end of a Partzuf, below Tahur, there are GE %0a%3c of Raglaim (feet) and AHP de Guf, which fell there. And AHP of Raglaim are not %0a%3c parts of a Partzuf whatsoever, as they are located at a lower degree. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Light that cannot be received by the Partzuf remains outside, surrounding %0a%3c it, and waits until the Partzuf acquires the strength to receive it. It is called %0a%3c "Surrounding Light," and it corresponds to the desires that do not take part in %0a%3c a Zivug, those desires that are still uncorrected and lack a screen. %0a%3c %0a%3c If, previously, before the second restriction, Malchut (the last Sefira of the %0a%3c Guf) was in Tahur, now, when only two Sefirot K-H remain in the Guf, Malchut de %0a%3c Guf, too, ascends to Bina de Guf, called Chazeh. Therefore, when Malchut ascends %0a%3c to Bina de Rosh, the entire Partzuf "diminishes" in size: the Rosh reaches only up %0a%3c to the Eynaim, the Guf only to the Chazeh, and the Raglaim only to Tabur. And %0a%3c that is why this state of the Partzuf is called "the state of Katnut." %0a%3c %0a%3c However, if the Partzuf receives new strength from Above, acquires a Masach %0a%3c (screen), it will be able to resolve to accept the Light for the Creator's sake in its %0a%3c AHP, then AHP de Rosh will rise again from the Guf to the Rosh, and complete the %0a%3c Rosh to ten Sefirot, while the Sefirot of AHP de Guf will ascend from the Raglaim back %0a%3c to their place in order to receive additional Light. And then Rosh, Guf, and Raglaim %0a%3c will all contain ten Sefirot. This state of the Partzuf is called "the state of Gadlut." %0a%3c %0a%3c In the language of The Zohar, the restriction of a Partzuf, its transition from %0a%3c the Gadlut state to the Katnut state is described as a division of each part of the %0a%3c Partzuf (Rosh, Guf, and Raglaim) into GE (MI) and AHP (ELEH). All ten Sefirot %0a%3c are called by the Creator's name Elokim, which consists of the letters ELEH- %0a%3c IM, that are further divided into MI - GE - K-H and ELEH - B-ZA-M. When %0a%3c in Katnut, only Sefirot ELEH maintain their degree, whereas Sefirot IM fall to a %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Who Created These (by Eliyahu) %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 97 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c lower degree. The word Elokim is read from below upwards, the way they are %0a%3c attained by man. %0a%3c %0a%3c Partzuf Partzuf %0a%3c %0a%3c in the Big State in the Small State %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c M-K %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c M-K %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 1 -H %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 1 -H %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Parsa %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c E -B %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c E -B %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c L- ZA %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c !

EH - M ; %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c IN HER HE SHAPED ALL THE CREATURES, AND IN HER %0a%3c CONFIRMED ALL THE LAWS— alludes to the division of each degree into two %0a%3c parts; their new form signifies the division into ELEH and MI, the separation %0a%3c of the Kelim (desires) of "bestowal" and "reception," where, due to the lack of %0a%3c strength to oppose one's nature (egoism), part of the Sefirot (desires) remain %0a%3c unused, outside of their degree. Accordingly, their Light remains outside as %0a%3c Ohr Makif (Surrounding Light), and waits until the Partzuf acquires additional %0a%3c strength to become big and thus receive all the Light. %0a%3c %0a%3c During the 6,000 years, our entire correction transpires only according to %0a%3c the laws of T?imt?um Bet (second restriction). As soon as the Partzuf acquires new %0a%3c strength (Masach) to receive the Light selflessly in Sefirot/ Kelim B-ZA-M (ELEH), %0a%3c it will immediately attach them to itself and receive in them the Lights Neshama- %0a%3c Haya-Yechida. And it will grow to become a big Partzuf consisting of five Kelim %0a%3c (ten Sefirot) with the five Lights of NRNHY. %0a%3c %0a%3c 14. He confirmed in the sacred and concealed candle (in Malchut that %0a%3c merged with Bina), a concealed image, the Holy of Holies, a secret structure %0a%3c that emerges from the thought, QAR that is called MI, which is the beginning %0a%3c of this structure. It stands and it does not stand; it is great and concealed in %0a%3c the name Elokim (ELEH and IM). It is called MI from the word Elokim, %0a%3c that is, it lacks the letters ELEH of the name Elokim. He desired to be %0a%3c revealed and called by the complete name Elokim, so He clothed Himself %0a%3c in a splendid shining garment, the Light of Hassadim. He created ELEH. %0a%3c The letters ELEH of the name Elokim ascended and combined with the %0a%3c letters MI and formed the complete name Elokim. And until He created %0a%3c ELEH, He did not rise (did not ascend) to the name Elokim. Hence, those %0a%3c who sinned by worshipping the Golden Calf alluded to this secret by saying, %0a%3c "ELEH (this is) your God, Israel!" (Shemot, 32:4). %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 98 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c "ELEH (this is) your God, Israel!"— that is, these egoistic desires (ELEH) are %0a%3c your deity, which you must worship until you correct yourself. The use of ELEH %0a%3c is the reason for all transgressions and ruin: the breaking of the vessels (Kelim), %0a%3c the sin of Adam and the shattering of his soul into 600,000 pieces, worshipping %0a%3c the Golden Calf and the breaking of the Tablets by Moshe, the ruin of the First %0a%3c and Second Temples, and so forth. %0a%3c %0a%3c As a result of the lower ones raising MAN, meaning their request to %0a%3c receive the strength necessary to make a Zivug and receive Ohr Hochma for %0a%3c the Creator's sake, there descends from Above the Light called MAD (Mayin %0a%3c Dechurin)-the force that enables the Kli to create a Masach capable of reflecting %0a%3c Light, thereby resisting its egoistic nature. This force comes in the form of %0a%3c Light, the sensation of the Creator's greatness, and is referred to as the Light of %0a%3c AB-SAG, as it descends from the Partzufim Hochma (AB) and Bina (SAG) of the %0a%3c world of AK (Adam Kadmon). %0a%3c %0a%3c If one ascends from the degree called "our world" to the worlds BYA, then %0a%3c wherever he may be in those worlds, his request for spiritual correction will rise %0a%3c through all the worlds and degrees up to Partzuf SAG. SAG turns to AB, receives %0a%3c the Light of Hochma from it, and passes it down to all the Partzufim along which %0a%3c MAN had ascended. %0a%3c %0a%3c Since the entire world of AK exists in the first restriction (Tzimtzum Aleph) %0a%3c and above the second restriction (Tzimtzum Bet), the Light that comes from %0a%3c it provides the Kli that receives this Light with the strength to pass from the %0a%3c small state to the big one. In other words, the Light of AB-SAG enables the Kli %0a%3c to create a Masach, reflect the Light of Hochma, and receive it for the Creator's %0a%3c sake. The Gadlut state is called "the holy of holies," for being filled with the %0a%3c Light of GAR (the holy of holies) is utterly perfect. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Light of AB-SAG first descends to the Rosh of Partzuf AA and lowers %0a%3c the point (Malchut) from the thought (Bina) back to its place in the Peh, where %0a%3c it was prior to Tzimtzum Bet. In consequence, the three Sefirot B-ZA-M rejoin the %0a%3c two Sefirot KH and become five Sefirot in the Rosh, AHP (ELEH) ascend and join %0a%3c with GE (MI), and the Creator's name Elokim is completed. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, this does not mean that the Partzuf can be filled with the five %0a%3c Lights NRNHY; it merely acquires a Masach, the strength to receive the Light %0a%3c in all its ten Sefirot. Since only Ohr Hochma shines in AA, this Light cannot %0a%3c fill the elevated Kelim of ELEH, as they can only receive Ohr Hochma if it is %0a%3c clothed by Ohr Hassadim. Only the GAR of the Partzuf (K-H-B) can have pure %0a%3c Ohr Hochma; the ZAT of the Partzuf (Sefirot ZA-M) can only receive diminished %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Who Created These (by Eliyahu) %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 99 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Ohr Hochma— half-mixed with Ohr Hassadim. This is called the reception of Ohr %0a%3c Hochma in the middle line (consisting of half Hochma and half Hassadim). %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, says The Zohar, THIS STRUCTURE STANDS AND IT DOES %0a%3c NOT STAND— even though all the Sefirot are already present in the Rosh, %0a%3c they still need to be filled with Light, meaning that Sefirot ELEH are not yet %0a%3c revealed in the name Elokim. Only the letters MI have so far been revealed %0a%3c (filled with the Light). %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, first, the Partzuf makes a Zivug on its Katnut state and receives Ohr %0a%3c Hassadim. Then, it clothes Ohr Hochma into PRECIOUS GARMENT (Ohr %0a%3c Hassadim). Only afterwards can the mixed Light of Hassadim and Hochma fill %0a%3c Sefirot ZAT (ELEH), and all five Sefirot will shine in perfection. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, before MI gives Ohr Hassadim to ELEH so as to enable ELEH %0a%3c to receive Ohr Hochma in it, ELEH cannot receive Ohr Hochma, and only the %0a%3c Light of MI shines in the entire name Elokim. Further, The Zohar tells us that %0a%3c neglect of Ohr Hassadim (the intention for the Creator's sake) is precisely what %0a%3c constitutes the entire transgression. And since they transgressed, i.e., neglected %0a%3c Ohr Hassadim, that is, since they did not wish to receive with the intention "for %0a%3c the Creator's sake," but desired only Ohr Hochma, they caused the separation %0a%3c of MI from ELEH. Hence, it is written, ELEH - THIS (the desires of reception %0a%3c and not MI, the desires of bestowal) IS YOUR LORD, ISRAEL-and the Light %0a%3c instantly passed to the impure forces. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Torah does not tell us about the history of an ancient nation, but %0a%3c about the structure of the spiritual degrees that we must attain. To know the %0a%3c properties of these degrees (whose attainment is designated by the acquisition %0a%3c of their properties), Kabbalah explains to us how they were originally created by %0a%3c a gradual descent (spiritual coarsening) from the Creator Himself. %0a%3c %0a%3c And in order to give us an opportunity to correct our egoism, the Creator %0a%3c mixed it with altruism at the very creation of the spiritual degrees. This kind %0a%3c of mixing of opposite properties is possible only through an "explosion," since %0a%3c opposite properties cannot be combined otherwise. There were several such %0a%3c mixtures that occurred as a result of explosions (breaking of properties). %0a%3c %0a%3c One of them is mentioned in the Torah (Shemot, 32:4), when, by worshiping %0a%3c the Golden Calf, the sons of Israel (the altruistic desires of "bestowal") suddenly %0a%3c wished to receive the Light for themselves. Consequently, the Sefirot (Kelim) of %0a%3c GE and AHP mixed together, and the properties (desires) of GE penetrated %0a%3c AHP. Through these altruistic properties that are secretly concealed within a %0a%3c small, egoistic human being, it is possible to awaken him, to evoke in him an %0a%3c aspiration to ascend spiritually and to disregard this world. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 100 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ved %0a%3c iin %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ;refore, everything that is written in the Torah should not be percer %0a%3c lot as history, but as an instruction manual. All the actions described %0a%3c the Torah are positive: all the devastations, including the ruin of the First and %0a%3c the Second Temples, wars, adultery and murder. We only need to realize what %0a%3c exactly the Torah is telling us. And one can understand it correctly only if he %0a%3c stops perceiving it as a collection of injunctions referring to the mechanical %0a%3c performance of commandments. %0a%3c %0a%3c 15. Just as MI join ELEH into one name Elokim, when Hochma clothes itself %0a%3c in Hassadim, so is the name combined by this precious shining garment. %0a%3c The world exists thanks to this secret, as is written, "The world was created %0a%3c by mercy." (Tehilim, 89:3). Then Eliyahu flew away, and I did not see him %0a%3c anymore. Yet, it is from him that I discovered that I stood upon the secret and %0a%3c its concealment. Rabbi Elazar approached with the others, and they bowed %0a%3c down before him. They wept and said, "If we have come into this world %0a%3c only to hear this— it is enough for us!" %0a%3c %0a%3c Rabbi Shimon continues his explanation: There is only one law of reception %0a%3c of Ohr Hochma: Ohr Hochma can only be received if Ohr Hassadim clothes it %0a%3c beforehand. Just as this occurs in Partzuf Bina, called "the Upper World," so %0a%3c does it occur in Partzuf Malchut (MA, ~Nukva of ZA), called "the lower world." %0a%3c Malchut is typically referred to as BON, but when she joins ZA and receives the %0a%3c Light from him, she is called by his name— MA. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Upper World, Bina of the world of Atzilut, desires only Hassadim, %0a%3c but the lower world, Malchut of the world of Atzilut, wants Hochma. However, %0a%3c Eliyahu the prophet spoke only of the order of Light and the structure of the %0a%3c name Elokim in AVI (Bina de Atzilut), whereas Rabbi Shimon continues his %0a%3c explanation in the next article and describes the structure and reception of %0a%3c Light in the name Elokim in Malchut de Atzilut herself. %0a\ No newline at end of file%0a
