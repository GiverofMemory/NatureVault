For my subject matter, as I %0aproceed in the fulfilment of my task, will now lead me to con¬ %0asider her in the light of being the producer of various noxious %0asubstances as well; in consequence of which it is that we arc %0ain the habit of charging her with our crimes, and imputing to %0aher a guilt that is our own. She has produced poisons, it is %0atrue; but who is it but man that has found them out ?

As for ourselves, we envenom the %0apoint of the arrow,® and we contrive to add to the destructive %0apowers of iron itself; by the aid of poisons we taint the waters %0aof the stream, and we infect the various elements of Nature ; %0aindeed, the very air even, which is the main support of life, %0awe turn into a medium for the destruction of life. %0a%0aAnd it is not that we are to suppose that animals are igno¬ %0arant of these means of defence, for we have already had occa¬ %0asion to point ouf* the preparations which they make against the %0aattacks of the serpent, and the methods they devise for effecting %0aa cure when wounded by it; and yet, among them aU, there %0ais not one that fights by the aid of the poison that belongs to %0aanother, with the sole exception of man. Let us then candidly %0aconfess our guilt, we who are not contented even with the %0apoisons as Nature has produced them ; for by far the greater %0aportion of them, in fact, are artificially prepared by the human %0ahand! %0a%0aAnd then besides, is it not the fact, that there are many %0amen, the very existence of whom is a baneful poison, as it %0awere ? Like that of the serpent, they dart their livid tongue, %0aand the venom of their disposition corrodes every object upon %0awhich it concentrates itself. Ever vilifying and maligning, %0alike the ill-omened birds of the night, they disturb the repose %0aof that darkness which is so peculiarly their own, and break %0a‘in upon the quiet of the night even, by their moans and wail¬ %0aings, the only sounds they are ever heard to emit. Like %0aanimals of inauspicious presage, they only cross our path to %0a%0a2 Of course this is only mere declamation ; it is not probable that the %0aanimals have any notion at all of sharpening the weapons that nature has %0agiven; in addition to which, this mode of sharpening them against hard %0asubstances would only wear aWay the enamel, and ultimately destroy them. %0aThe acts of animals in a moment of rage or frenzy have evidently been %0amistaken here for the dictates of instinct, or even a superior intelligence. %0a%0a3 See B.

It is in %0aour high esteem for men such as these, and the commendations %0athey bestow, that we shall be content to leave the others, like %0aso many brakes and brambles, to the devouring flames of their %0aown bad passions, and to persist in promoting the welfare of %0athe human race; and this, with all the more energy and per¬ %0aseverance, from the circumstance that it has been our object %0athroughout, rather to produce a work of lasting utility than to %0aensure ourselves a widely-spread renown. We have only to %0aspeak, it is true, of the fields and of rustic operations; hut %0astill, it is upon these that the enjoyment of life so materially %0adepends, and that the ancients conferred the very highest rank %0ain their honours and commendations. %0a%0a%0aCHAP. 2. (2.) -WHEN THE FIliST WREATHS OF CORN WERE USED %0a%0aAT ROME. %0a%0aRomulus was the first who established the-4.rval® priesthood %0aat Rome. This order consisted of the eleven sons of Acca %0aLarentia, his nurse,’ together with Romulus himself, who as¬ %0asumed the appellation of the twelfth of the brotherhood. Upon %0athis priesthood he bestowed, as being the most august dis¬ %0atinction that he could confer upon it, a wreath of ears of corn, %0atied together with a wliite fillet; and this, in fact, was the %0afirst chaplet that was ever used at Rome. This dignity is only %0aended with life itself, and whether in exile or in captivity, it %0a%0a® This sentiinent is not at all akin to the melancholy view which our %0aauthor takes of mankind at the beginning of B. vii. and in other parts of %0athis work.

In those early days, two jugera of %0alaud were considered enough for a citizen of Rome, and to none %0awas a larger portion than this allotted. And yet, at the present %0aday, men who but lately were the slaves of the Emperor Nero %0ahave been hardly content with pleasure-gardens that occupied %0athe same space as this ; while they must have fishponds, for¬ %0asooth, of still greater extent, and in some instances I might %0aadd, perhaps, kitchens even as well. %0a%0aNuma first established the custom of offering corn to the %0agods, and of propitiating them with the salted® cake; he was %0athe first, too, as we learn from Hemina, to parch spelt, from %0athe fact that, when in this state, it is more wholesome as an %0aaliment.® This method, however, he could only establish one %0away : by making an enactment, to the effect that spelt is not %0ain a pure state for offering, except when parched. He it was, %0atoo, who instituted the Eornacalia,'® festivals appropriated %0afor the parching of corn, and others,” observed with equal %0asolemnity, for the erection and preservation of the “ termini,” %0aor boundaries of the fields: for these termini, in those days, %0athey particularly regarded as gods; while to other divinities %0athey gave the names of Seia,” from “ sero,” “ to sow,” and of %0aSegesta, from the “ segetes,” or “crops of standing corn,” the %0astatues of which goddesses we still see erected in the Circus. %0aA third divinity it is forbidden by the rules of our religion to %0aname even'® beneath a roof.

(3.)- THE JUGEEinil OF LAND. %0a%0aThat portion of land used to be known as a “ jugcrum,” %0a%0a® Made of salt and the meal or flour of spelt. Salt was the emblem of %0awisdom, friendship, and other virtues. %0a%0a® This, Fee observes, is not the case with any kind of wheat; with %0amanioc, which has an acrid principle, the process may he necessary, in %0aorder to make it fit for food. %0a%0aOr Feast of the Furnace or Oven.

This last was one hundred and twenty feet in length; %0aand two in length made a jugerum. The most considerable %0arecompense that could be bestowed upon generals and valiant %0acitizens, was the utmost extent of land around which a person %0acould trace a furrow with the plough in a single day. The %0awhole population, too, used to contribute a quarter’® of a sex- %0atarius of spelt, or else half a one, per head. %0a%0aFrom agriculture the earliest surnames were derived. Thus, %0afor instance, the name of Pilumnus was given to him who in¬ %0avented the “ pilum,” or pestle of the bake-house, for pounding %0aeorn ; that of Piso was derived from “ piso,” to grind com ; %0aand those of Fabius, Lentulus, and Cicero, from the several %0avarieties’® of leguminous plants in the cultivation of which re¬ %0aspectively these individuals excelled. One individual of the %0afamily of the Junii received the name of “ Bubulcus,”” from %0athe skill he displayed in breeding oxen. Among the sacred %0aceremonials, too, there was nothing that was held more holy %0athan the marriage by confarreation,’® and the woman just %0amarried used to present a cake made of spelt.’® Careless cul¬ %0ativation of the land was in those times an offence / that came %0aunder the cognizance of the censors; and, as we learn from %0aCato,®® when it was said that such and such a man was a good %0aagriculturist or a good husbandman, it was looked upon as the %0avery highest compliment that could be paid him. A man %0acame to be called “ locuples,” or “ rich,” from being “ loci %0aplenus,” or “ full of earth.” Money, too, received its name %0aof “pecunia,”®^ from “ pecus,” “cattle.” At the present %0a%0aFour Roman feet in width, and 120 in length. %0a%0aQuartarius. %0a%0a“ Faha,” a bean ; “ Lens,” a lentil; and “ Cicer,” a chick-pea. %0a%0aA “ bubus,” from “ oxen.” Gains Junius Buhulcus was twiee Consul, %0aand once Master of the Horse. %0a%0a18 « Farreum” was a form of marriage, in which certain words were %0aused, in presence of ten witne.sses, and were accompanied by a certain re¬ %0aligious ceremony, in which “ panis farreus” was employed ; hence this form %0aof marriage was called “ confarreatio.” %0a%0aFarreum. %0a%0a20 De Re Rust.

Fines, too, were only imposed in the %0ashape of paying so many sheep or so many oxen; and the be¬ %0anevolent spirit of the ancient laws deserves remark, which %0amost considerately enjoined that the magistrate, when he in¬ %0aflicted a penalty, should never impose a fine of an ox before %0ahaving first condemned the same party to the payment of a %0asheep. %0a%0aThose who celebrated the public games in honour of the ox %0areceived the name of Bubetii.** King Servius was the first %0awho impressed upon our copper coin^ the figures of sheep and %0aoxen. To depasture cattle secretly by night upon the unripe %0acrops on plough lands, or to cut them in that state, was made %0aby the Twelve Tables'^ a capital oflence in the case of an %0aadult; and it was enacted that the person guilty of it should %0abe hanged, in order to make due reparation to the goddess %0aCeres, a punishment more severe, even, than that inflicted for %0amurder. If, on the other hand, the offender was not an adult, %0ahe was beaten at the discretion of the praetor; a penalty double %0athe amount of the damage was also exacted. %0a%0aThe various ranks, too, and distinctions in the state had no %0aother origin than the pursuits of agriculture. The rural %0atribes held the foremost rank, and were composed of those %0awho possessed lands ; while those of the city, a place to which %0ait was looked upon as ignominious to be transferred, had the %0adiscredit thrown upon them of being an indolent race. Hence %0ait was that these last were only four in number, and received %0atheir names from the several parts of the City which they re¬ %0aspectively inhabited; being the Suburran, the Palatine, Col- %0aline, and Exquiline tribes. Every ninth day^* the rural tribes %0aused to visit the city for the purpose of marketing, and it was %0afor this reason that it was made illegal to hold the comitia upon %0a%0a^ St Augustin, De Civ.

In those days repose and sleep were enjoyed upon %0astraw. Even to glory itself, in compliment to corn, the name %0awas given of “ adorea.”^ %0a%0aFor my own part, I greatly admirethe modes of expres¬ %0asion employed in our ancient language: thus, for instance, %0awe read in the Commentaries of the Priesthood to the follow¬ %0aing eflEect :—“ For deriving an augury from the sacrifice of a %0abitch,a day should be set apart before the ear of corn appears %0afrom out of the sheath,'^® and then again before it enters the %0asheath.” %0a%0aCHAP. 4.— now often and on what occasions cobn has sold %0a%0aAT A EEMAEKABLY LOW PRICE. %0a%0aThe consequence was, that when the Roman manners were %0asuch as these, the corn that Italy produced was sufficient for %0aits wants, and it had to be indebted to no province for its %0afood; and not only this, but the price of provisions was in¬ %0acredibly cheap. Manius Marcius, the aedile^® of the people, %0awas the first who gave corn to the people at the price of one %0aas for the mbdius. L. Minutius Augurinus,®' the same who %0adetected, when.eleventh tribune of the people, the projects of %0aSpurius Maelius, reduced the price of com on three market %0adays,®* to one as per modius; for which reason a statue was %0aerected in honour of him, by public subscription, without the %0aTrigeminian Gate.®® T. Seius distributed corn to the people. %0a%0aFrom “ ador,” the old name for “ speltbecause corn was the chief %0areward given to the conqueror, and his temples were graced with a wreath %0aof com. %0a%0aIn the first place, it is difficult to see what there is in this passage to %0aadmire, or “wonder at,” if that is the meaning of “admiror;” and then, %0abesides, it has no connection with the context. The text is probably in a %0adefective state. %0a%0aSee c. 69 of this Book. %0a%0a39 u Vagina.” The meaning of this word here has not been exactly %0aascertained.

In the year,^ %0atoo, in which the Mother of the Gods was brought to Rome, the %0aharvest of that summer, it is said, was more abundant than it %0ahad been for ten years before. M. Varro informs us, that in the %0ayear®® in which L. Metellus exhibited so many elephants in %0ahis triumphal procession, a modius of spelt was sold for one as, %0awhich was the standard price also of a congius of wine, thirty %0apounds’ weight of dried figs, ten pounds of olive oil, and %0atwelve pounds of flesh meat. Nor did this cheapness originate %0ain the wide-spread domains of individuals encroaching con¬ %0atinually upon their neighbours, for by a law proposed by Lici- %0anius Stolo, the landed property of each individual was limited %0ato five hundred jugera; and he himself was convicted under %0ahis own law of being the owner of more than that amount, %0ahaving as a disguise prevailed upon his sou to lend him his %0aname. Such were the prices of commodities at a time when %0athe fortunes of the republic were rapidly on the increase. The %0awords, too, that were uttered by Manius Curius®^ after his %0atriumphs and the addition of an immense extent of territory %0ato the Roman sway, are well known: “ The man must be %0alooked upon,” said he, “as a dangerous citizen, for whom %0aseven jugera of land are not enough;” such being the amount %0aof land that had been allotted to the people after the expulsion %0aof the kings. %0a%0aWhat, then, was the cause of a fertility so remarkable as %0athis ? The fact, we have every reason to believe, that in %0athose days the lands were tilled by the hands of generals %0aeven, the soil exulting beneath a plough-share crowned with %0awreaths of laurel, and guided by a husbandman graced with %0atriumphs: whether it is that they tended the seed with the %0asame care that they had displayed in the conduct of wars, and %0amanifested the same diligent attention in the management of %0atheir fields that they had done in the arrangement of the camp, %0a%0aA.u.c. 345. %0a%0aA.u.c. 550.

And yet the Earth is not deaf to our %0aadjurations, when we address her by the name of “parent,” %0aand say that she receives our homage^^ in being tilled by %0ahands such as these; as though, forsooth, we ought not to be¬ %0alieve that she is reluctant and indignant at being tended in %0asuch a manner as this!

Cato had already compiled his Book of Precepts; %0ait took every care also to entrust the execution of this task to %0amen who were well versed in the Carthaginian tongue, among %0awhom was pre-eminent D. Silanus, a member of one of the %0amost illustrious families of Rome. I have already indicated,^’ %0aat the commencement of this work, the numerous learned %0aauthors and writers in verse, together with other illustrious %0amen, whose authority it is my intention to follow ; but among %0athe number I may here more particularly distinguish M. Varro, %0awho, at the advanced age of eighty-eight years, thought it %0ahis duty to publish a treatise upon this subject. %0a%0a(4.) Among the Romans the cultivation of the vine was %0aintroduced at a comparatively recent period, and at first, as %0aindeed they were obliged to do, they paid their sole attention %0ato the culture of the fields. The various methods of cultivat¬ %0aing the land will now be our subject; and they shall be treated %0aof by us in no ordinary or superficial manner, but in the same %0aspirit in which we have hitherto written; enquiry shall be %0amade with every care first into the usages of ancient days, and %0athen into the discoveries of more recent times, our attention %0abeing devoted alike to the primary causes of these operations, %0aand^theireasons upon which they are respectively based. We %0ashall make mention,"'^ too, of the various constellations, and of %0athe several indications which, beyond all doubt, they afford to %0athe earth; and the more so, from the fact that those •writers %0awho have hitherto treated of them with any degree of exact¬ %0aness, seem to have written their works for the use of any class %0aof men but the agriculturist. %0a%0aIn the First Book, as originally -written.

And whj’- should we not view in the light %0aof oracles those precepts which have been tested by the infal¬ %0alibility of time and the truthfulness of experience ? %0a%0a(5.) To make a beginning, then, with Cato'*®—“ The agricul¬ %0atural population,” says he, “ produces the bravest men, the %0amost valiant soldiers,'*® and a class of citizens the least given of %0aall to evil designs.—Do not be too eager in buying a farm.;— %0aIn rural operations never be sparing of your trouble, and, above %0aall, when you are purchasing land.—A bad bargain is always %0aa ground for repentance.—Those who are about to purchase %0aland, should always have an eye more particularly to the water %0athere, the roads, and the neighbourhood.” Each of these %0apoints is susceptible of a very extended explanation, and %0areplete with undoubted truths. Cato^’ recommends, too, that %0aan eye should be given to the people in the neighbourhood, to %0asee how they look ; “ For where the land is good,” says he, %0a“ the people will look well-conditioned and healthy.” %0a%0aAtilius Eegulus, the same who was twice consul in the %0aPunic War, used to say^® that a person should neither buy an %0aunhealthy piece of land in the most fertile locality, nor yet the %0avery healthiest spot if in a barren country. The salubrity of %0aland, however, is not always to be judged of from the looks of %0athe inhabitants, for those who are well-seasoned are able to %0awithstand the effects of living in pestilent localities even. And %0athen, besides, there are some localities that are healthy during %0acertain periods of the year only; though, in reality, there is %0ano soil that can be looked upon as really valuable that is not %0ahealthy all the year through. “ That^® is sure to be bad land %0aagainst which its owner has a continual struggle.” Cato %0arecommends us before everjdhing, to see that the land which %0a%0aDe Re Rust.

We %0ashould see, too, he says, that there is an abundance of manual %0alabour in the neighbourhood, as well as a thriving town ; that %0athere are either rivers or roads, to facilitate the carriage of the %0aproduce; that the buildings upon the land are substantially %0aerected, and that the land itself bears every mark of having %0abeen carefully tilled—a point upon which I lind that many %0apersons are greatly mistaken, as they are apt to imagine that %0athe negligence of the previous owner is greatly to the pur¬ %0achaser’s advantage ; while the fact is, that there is nothing more %0aexpensive than the cultivation of a neglected soil. %0a%0aFor this reason it is that Cato“ says that it is best to buy %0aland of a careful proprietor, and that the methods adopted by %0aothers ought not to be hastily rejected—that it is the same %0awith land as with mankind—however great the proceeds, if at %0athe same time it is lavish and extravagant, there will be no %0agreat profits left. Cato looks upon a vineyard as the most” %0aprofitable investment; and he is far from wrong in that opi¬ %0anion, seeing that he takes such particular care to retrench all %0asuperfluous expenses. In the second rank he places gar¬ %0adens that have a good supply of water, and with good reason, %0atoo, supposing always that they are near a town. The ancients %0agave to meadow lands the name of “ parata,” or lands “ always %0aready.”®^ %0a%0aCato being asked, on one occasion, what was the most cer¬ %0atain source of profit, “ Good pasture land,” was his answer; %0aupon which, enquiry was made what was the next best. “Pretty %0agood®® pasture lands,” said he—the amount of all which is, that %0ahe looked upon that as the most certain source of income %0awhich stands in need of the smallest outlay.

(6.)- THE PROPEE ARRANGEMENTS FOR A FARM-HOUSE. %0a%0aThe proper plan to be pursued is this: ®’ the farm-house must %0anot be unsuitable for the farm, nor the farm for the house; and %0awe must be on our guard against following the examples of L. %0aLucullus and Q. Scaevola, who, though living in the same age, %0afell into the two opposite extremes; for whereas the farm-house %0aof Scaevola was not large enough for the produce of his farm, %0athe farm of Lucullus was not sufficiently large for the house he %0abuilt upon it; an error which gave occasion to the reproof of %0athe censors, that on his farm there was less of ground for %0aploughing than of floor for sweeping. The proper arrange¬ %0aments for a farm-house are not to be made without a certain %0adegree of skill. C. Marius, who was seven times consul, was %0athe last person who had one built at Misenum;®® but he erected %0ait with such a degree of that artistic skill which he had dis¬ %0aplayed in castrametation, that Sylla Felix®® even made the %0aremark, that in comparison with Marius, all the others had %0abeen no better than blind.®® %0a%0aIt is generally agreed, that a farm-house ought neither to %0abe built near a marsh, nor with a river in front of it; for, as %0a%0a55 “ Aliena insania frni.” We have a saying to a similar effect: “ Fools %0abuild houses, and wise men buy them.” %0a%0a56 “ Frons domini plus prodest quam occipitium.” See Cato, De Ke %0aRust. c. 4 ; also Phaedrus, B. iv.

In hot localities, a farm-house should have a %0anorthern aspect, but where it is cold, it should look towards %0athe south ; where, on the other hand, the site is temperate, the %0ahouse should look due east. Although, when speaking®* of %0athe best kinds of soil, I may seem to have sufficiently discussed %0athe characteristics by which it may be known, I shall take the %0apresent opportunity of adding a few more indications, employ¬ %0aing the words of Cato®® more particularly for the purpose. %0a“ The dwarf-elder,” says he, “the wild plum,®^ the bramble, %0athe small bulb,®® trefoil, meadow grass,®® the quercus, and the %0awild pear and wild apple, are all of them indicative of a com %0aland. The same is the case, too, where the land is black, or %0aof an ashy colour. All chalky soils are scorching, unless they %0aare very thin ; the same, too, with sand, unless it is remarkably %0afine. These remarks, however, are more applicable to cham¬ %0apaign localities than declivities.” %0a%0aThe ancients were of opinion, that before everything, mode¬ %0aration should be observed in the extent of a farm; for it was %0aa favourite maxim of theirs, that we ought to sow the less, and %0aplough the more : such too, I find, was the opinion entertained %0aby Virgil,®^ and indeed, if we must confess the truth, it is the %0awide-spread" domains that have been the ruin®® of Italy, and %0asoon will be that of the provinces as well.

With that great¬ %0aness of mind which was so peculiarly his own, and of wliich %0ahe ought not to lose the credit, Cneius Pompeius would never %0apufchase the lands that belonged to a neighbour. Mago has %0astated it as his opinion, that a person, on buying a farm, ought %0aat once to sell his town house an opinion, however, which %0asavours of too great rigidity, and is by no means conformable to %0athe public good. It is with these words, indeed, that he begins %0ahis precepts; a good proof, at all events, that he looks upon the %0apersonal inspection of the owner as of primary importance. %0a%0aThe next point which requires our care is to employ a farm- %0asteward’’^^ of experience, and upon this, too, Cato'”^ has given %0amany useful precepts. Still, however, it must suffice for %0ame to say that the steward ought to be a man nearly as clever %0aas his master, though without appearing to know it. It is the %0avery worst plan of all, to have land tilled by slaves let loose %0afrom the houses of correction, as, indeed, is the case with all %0awork entrusted to men who live without hope. I may possibly %0aappear guilty of some degree of rashness in making mention of %0aa maxim of the ancients, which will very probably be looked %0aupon as quite incredible—“ That nothing is so disadvantageous %0aas to cultivate land in the highest style of perfection.” L. %0aTarius Rufus, a man who, bom in the very lowest ranks of %0alife, by his military talents finally attained the consulship,’® %0aand who in other respects adhered to the old-fashioned notions %0aof thriftiness, made away with about one hundred millions of %0asesterces, which, by the liberality of the late Emperor Augus¬ %0atus, he had contrived to amass, in buying up lands in Picenum, %0aand cultivating them in the highest style, his object being to %0again a name thereby ; the consequence of which was, that his %0aheir renounced’’^ the inheritance.

C. Furius ChresiH^us, a freedman, having found him¬ %0aself able, from a very small piece of land, to raise far more %0aabundant harvests than his neighbours could from the largest %0afarms, became the object of very considerable jealousy among %0athem, and was accordingly accused of enticing away the crops %0aof others by the practice of sorcery. Upon this, a day was %0anamed by Spurius Calvinus, the curule aedile, for his appear¬ %0aance. Apprehensive of being condemned, when the question %0acame to be put to the vote among the tribes, he had all his %0aimplements of husbandry brought into the Forum, together %0awith his farm servants, robust, well-conditioned, and well-clad %0apeople, Piso says. The iron tools were of first-rate quality, %0athe mattocks were stout and strong, the plough-shares ponde¬ %0arous and substantial, and the oxen sleek and in prime condi¬ %0ation. When all this had been done, “ Here, Koman citi¬ %0azens,” said he, “ are my implements of magic; but it is impos¬ %0asible for me to exhibit to your view, or to bring into this %0aForum, those midnight toils of mine, those early watchings, %0athose sweats, and those fatigues.” Upon this, by the unani¬ %0amous voice of the people, he was immediately acquitted. %0aAgriculture, in fact, depends upon the expenditure of labour %0aand exertion; and hence it is that the ancients were in the %0ahabit of saying, that it is the eye of the master that does more %0atowards fertilizing a field than anything else. %0a%0aWe shall give the rest of these precepts in their appropriate %0aplaces, according as we find them adapted to each variety of %0acultivation ; but in the meantime we must not omit some of a %0ageneral nature, which here recur to our recollection, and more %0a%0aVirgil, Georg. I. 268, et seq., speaks of the work that might be done %0aon feast days—making hedges, for instance, irrigating land, catching %0abirds, washing sheep, and burning weeds. %0a%0a%0a18 %0a%0a%0aPLINY’s natural UlSTOBT. %0a%0a%0a[Book XVIII. %0a%0a%0aparticularly that maxim of Cato, as profitable as it is humane: %0a“ Always act in such away as to secure the love of your neigh¬ %0abours.” He then proceeds to state his reasons for giving this %0aadvice, but it appears to me that no one surely can entertain %0athe slightest doubt upon the subject. One of the very first %0arecommendations that he gives is to take every care that the %0afarm servants are kept in good condition.'* It is a maxim %0auniversally agreed upon in agriculture, that nothing must be %0adone too late ; and again, that everything must be done at its %0aproper season; while there is a third precept, which reminds %0aus that opportunities lost can never be regained. The male¬ %0adiction uttered by Cato against rotten ground has been treated %0aof at some length already ;®* but there is another precept which %0ahe is never tired of repeating, “ Whatever can be done by the %0ahelp of the ass, will cost the least money.” %0a%0aTern will be sure to die at the end of a couple of years, if %0ayou prevent it from putting forth leaves ; the most efficient me¬ %0athod of ensuring this is to beat the branches with a stick while %0athey are in bud ; for then the juices that drop from it will kill %0athe roots.It is said, too, that fern will not spring up again %0aif it is pulled up by the roots about the turn of the summer %0asolstice, or if the stalks are cut with the edge of a reed, or if it %0ais turned up with a plough-share with a reed placed** upon it. %0aIn the same way, too, we are told that reeds maybe effectually %0aploughed up, if care is taken to place a stalk of fern upon the %0ashare. A field infested with rushes should be turned up with %0athe spade, or, if the locality is stony, with a two-pronged %0amattock : overgrown shrubs are best removed by fire. Where %0aground is too moist, it is an advantageous plan to cut trenches %0ain it and so drain it; where the soil is cretaceous, these trenches %0ashould be left open; and where it is loose, they should be %0astrengthened with a hedge to prevent them from falling in. %0aWhen these drains are made on a declivity, they should have %0aa layer of gutter tiles at the bottom, or else house tiles with the %0aface upwards : in some cases, too, they should be covered” %0a%0a79 familiae male sit.” so Jn B. xvii. c. 3. %0a%0aSI The Pteris aquilina, or female fern.

(7.)—THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF GRAIN. %0a%0aAs the field is now prepared, we shall proceed to speak of %0athe nature of the various kinds of grain; we must premise, %0ahowever, that there are two principal classes of grain, the %0acereals,®® comprising wheat and barley, and the legumina, such %0aas the bean and the chick-pea, for instance.

There are some, again, that are sown at either %0aseason in Italy, and others at a third period, or, in other %0awords, in the spring. Some authors give the name of spring- %0agrain to millet, panic, lentils,®® chick-peas,®* and alica,®* %0awhile they call wheat, barley, beans, turnips, and rape, semen- %0ative or early sowing seeds. Certain species of wheat are only %0asown to make fodder for cattle, and are known by the name of %0a“ farrago,”®® or mixed grain; the same, too, with the legumi¬ %0anous plants, the vetch, for instance. The lupine,* however, is %0agrown in common as food for both cattle and men. %0a%0aAll the leguminous* plants, with the exception of the bean, %0ahave a single root, hard and tough, like wood, and destitute of %0anumerous ramifications; the chick-pea has the deepest root of %0aall. Corn has numerous fibrous roots, but no ramifications. %0aBarley makes its appearance* above ground the seventh day %0aafter sowing; the leguminous plants on the fourth, or at the %0avery latest, the seventh; the bean from the fifteenth day to %0athe twentieth: though in Egypt the leguminous plants appear %0aas early as the third day after they are sown. In barley, one %0aextremity of the grain throws out the root, and the other the %0a%0aPauicum Italicum of Linnaeus. %0a%0aPanicum miliaceum of Linnaeus.

In the %0acereals in general it is the thicker end of the seed that throws %0aout the root, the thinner end the blossom; while in the other %0aseeds both root and blossom issue from the same part. %0a%0aDuring the winter, corn is in the blade; hut in the spring %0awinter corn throws out a tall stem. As for millet and panic, %0athey grow Avith a jointed and grooved^ stalk, while sesame has %0aa steui resembling that of fennel-giant. The fruit of all these %0aseeds is either contained in an ear, as in wheat and barley, for %0ainstance, and protected from the attacks of birds and small %0aanimals by a prickly beard bristling like so many palisades; or %0aelse it is enclosed in pods, as in the leguminous plants, or in %0acapsules, as in sesame and the poppy. Millet and panic can %0aonly be said to belong to the grower and the small birds in %0acommon, as they have nothing but a thin membrane to cover %0athem, without the slightest protection. Panic receives that %0aname from the panicule® or down that is to be seen upon it; %0athe head of it droops languidly, and the stalk tapers gra¬ %0adually in thickness, being of almost the toughness and con¬ %0asistency of wood : the head is loaded with grain closely packed, %0athere being a tuft upon the top, nearly a foot in length. In %0amillet the husks which embrace the grain bend downward with %0aa wavy tuft upon the edge. There are several varieties of %0apanic, the mammose, for instance, the ears of which are in %0aclusters with small edgings of down, the head of the plant %0abeing double ; it is distinguished also according to the colour, %0athe white, for instance, the black, the red, and the purple %0aeven.

This stalk springs up to the height %0aof seven feet, and has tufts of a remarkable size, known by the %0aname of “ phobse.” ® This is the most prolific of all the cereals, %0afor from a single grain no less than three sextarii® are pro¬ %0aduced ; it requires, however, to be sown in a humid soil. %0a%0aSome kinds of corn begin to form the ear at the third joint, %0aand others at the fourth, though at its first formation the ear %0aremains still concealed. Wheat, however, has four^° articula¬ %0ations, spelt^^ six, and barley eight. In the case of these last, %0athe ear does not begin to form before the number of joints, as %0aabove mentioned, is complete. Within four or five days, at %0athe very latest, after the ear has given signs of forming, the %0aplant begins to flower, and in the course of as many days or a %0alittle more, sheds its blossom : barley blossoms at the end of %0aseven days at the very latest. Varro says that the grains are %0aperfectly formed at the end of four times^^ nine days from their %0adowering, and are ready for cutting at the ninth month. %0a%0aThe bean, again, first appears in leaf, and then throws out %0aa stalk, which has no articulations*® upon it. The other legu¬ %0aminous plants have a tough, ligneous stalk, and some of them %0athrow out branches, the chick-pea, the fitch, and the lentil, %0afor instance. In some of the leguminous plants, the pea, for %0aexample, the stem creeps along the ground, if care is not taken %0ato support it by sticks: if this precaution is omitted, the %0aqualit}'^ is deteriorated. The bean and the lupine are the only %0aones among the leguminous plants that have a single stem; in %0aall the others the stem throws out branches, being of a lig¬ %0aneous nature, very thin, and in all cases hollow. Some of %0athese plants throw out the leaves from the root, others at the %0atop.*'* Wheat, barley, and the vetch, all the plants, in fact, %0awhich produce straw, have a single leaf only at the summit: %0ain barley, however, this leaf is rough, w^hile in the others it %0a%0a® From the Greek (pojSri.

In corn the leaf %0ais similar to that of the reed, while in the bean it is round, as %0aalso in a great proportion of the leguminous plants. In the %0aervilia^® and the pea the leaf is long,'® in the kidney-bean %0aveined, and in sesame'’ and irio the colour of blood. The %0alupine and the poppy are the only ones among these plants that %0alose'® their leaves. %0a%0aThe leguminous plants remain a longer time in flower, the %0afitch and the chick-pea more particularly ; but the bean is in %0ablossom the longest of them all, for the flower remains on it %0aforty days; not, indeed, that each stalk retains its blossom %0afor aU that length of time, but, as the flower goes off in %0aone, it comes on in another. In the bean, too, the crop is not %0anpe all at once, as is the case with corn ; for the pods make %0atheir appearance at different times, at the lowest parts first, %0athe blossom mounting upwards by degrees. %0a%0aWhen the blossom is off in corn, the stalk gradually thickens, %0aand it ripens within forty days at the most. The same is the %0acase, too, with the bean, but the chick-pea takes a much shorter %0atime to ripen ; indeed, it is fit for gathering within forty days %0afrom the time that it is sown. Millet, panic, sesame, and all the %0asummer grains are ripe within forty days after blossoming, %0awith considerable variations, of course, in reference to soil and %0aweather. Thus, in Egypt, we find barley cut at the end of %0asix months, and wheat at the end of seven, from the time of %0asowing. In Hellas, again, barley is cut in the seventh month, %0aand in Peloponnesus in the eighth ; the wheat being got in at %0aa still later period. %0a%0aThose grains which grow on a stalk of straw are enclosed %0ain an envelope protected bj'^ a prickly beard; while in the bean %0aand the leguminous plants in general they are enclosed in pods %0aupon branches which shoot alternately from either side.

Wheat, barley, and %0awinter-wheat®® are threshed out; they are cleaned, too, for %0asowing just as they are prepared for the mill, there being no %0anecessity for parching®® them. Spelt, on the other hand, miUet, %0aand panic, cannot be cleaned without parching them ; hence it %0ais that they are always sown raw and with the chaff on. Spelt %0ais preserved in the husk, too, for sowing, and, of course, is not %0ain such case parched by the action of fire. %0a%0aCHAP. 11.-SPELT. %0a%0aOf all these grains barley is the lightest,®^ its weight rarely %0aexceeding fifteen pounds to the modius, while that of the bean %0ais twenty-two. Spelt is much heavier than barley, and wheat %0aheavier than spelt. In Egypt they make a meal®* of olyra,®® %0aa third variety of corn that grows there. The Gauls have %0aalso a kind of spelt peculiar to that country: they give it the %0aname of “ brace,”®® while to us it is known as “sandala:” it %0ahas a grain of remarkable whiteness. Another difference, %0aagain, is the fact that it yields nearly four pounds more of %0abread to the modius than any other kind of spelt. Verrius %0astates that for three hundred years the Romans made use of no %0aother meal than that of corn. %0a%0aIf by “ tunica” he means the husk of chaff, which surrounds the %0agrain, the assertion is contrary to the fact, in relation to barley and the %0aoat. %0a%0aOnly another name, Fee thinks, for the Triticum hibernum, or winter- %0awheat.

Among these the %0awheat of Boeotia'® occupies the fii’st rank, that of Sicily the %0asecond, and that of Africa the third. The wheats of Thrace, %0aSyria, and, more recently, of Egypt, used to hold the third rank %0afor weight, these facts having been ascertained through the %0amedium of the athletes; whose powers of consumption, equal %0ato those of beasts of burden, have established the gradations in %0aweight, as already stated. Greece, too, held the Pontic^® wheat %0ain high esteem ; but this has not reached Italy as yet. Of %0aall the varieties of grain, however, the Greeks gave the pre¬ %0aference to the kinds called dracontion, strangia, and Selinusium, %0athe chief characteristic of which is a stem of remarkable thick¬ %0aness : it was this, in the opinion of the Greeks, that marked %0athem as the peculiar growth of a rich soil. On the other hand, %0athoj'^ recommended for sowing in humid soils an extremely %0alight and diminutive species of grain, with a remarkably thin %0astalk, known to them as speudias, and standing in need of an %0aabundance of nutriment. Such, at all events, were the opi¬ %0anions generally entertained in the reign of Alexander the Great,, %0aat a time when Greece was at the height of her glory, and the %0amost powerful country in the world. Still, however, nearly %0aone hundred and forty-four years before the death of that %0aprince we find the poet Sophocles, in his Tragedy of “ Trip- %0atolemus,” praising the corn of Italy before all others. The %0apassage, translated word for word, is to the following effect: %0a%0a“And favour’d Italy grows white with hoary wheat.’’ %0a%0aI %0a%0aAnd it is this whiteness that is still one of the peculiar merits %0aof the Italian wheat; a circumstance which makes me the more %0asurprised to find that none of the Greek writers of a later %0aperiod have made any reference to it. %0a%0a28 From Theophrastus, De Causis, B. iv. %0a%0a29 That of the Ukraine and its vicinity, which is still held in high esteem. %0a%0a%0a26 pltnt’s natubal histobt. [Book XVIIL %0a%0aOf the various kinds of wheat which are imported at the %0apresent day into Rome, the lightest in weight are those which %0acome from Gaul and Chersonnesus ; for, upon weighing them, %0ait will be found that they do not yield more than twenty %0apounds to the modius. The grain of Sardinia weighs half a %0apound more, and that of Alexandria one-third of a pound more %0athan that of Sardinia; the Sicilian wheat is the same iu %0aweight as the Alexandrian. The Boeotian wheat, again, weighs %0aa whole pound more than these last, and that of Africa a pound %0aand three quarters. In Italy beyond the Padus, the spelt, to %0amy knowledge, weighs twenty-five pounds to the modius, and, %0ain the vicinity of Clusium, six-and-twenty. AVe find it a %0arule, universally established by Nature, that in every kind of %0acommissariat bread®® that is made, the bread exceeds the weight %0aof the grain by one-third; and in the same way it is generally %0aconsidered that that is the best kind of wheat, which, in %0akneading, will absorb one congius of water.®^ There are some %0akinds of wheat which give, when used by themselves, an ad¬ %0aditional weight equal to this; the Balearic wheat, for instance, %0awhich to a modius of grain yields thirty-five pounds weight of %0abread. Others, again, will only give this additional weight %0aby being mixed with other kinds, the Cj'prian wheat and the %0aAlexandrian, for example; which, if used by themselves, will %0ayield no more than twenty pounds to the modius. The wheat %0aof Cyprus is swarthy, and produces a dark bread; for which %0areason it is generally mixed with the white wheat of Alexan¬ %0adria; the mixture yielding twenty-five pounds of bread to the %0amodius of grain. The wheat of Thebais, in Egypt, Avhen %0amade into bread, yields twenty-six pounds to the modius. To %0aknead the meal with sea-water, as is mostly done in the mari¬ %0atime districts, for the purpose of saving the salt, is extremely %0apernicious; there is nothing, in fact, that will more readily %0apredispose the human body to disease. In Gaul and Spain, %0awhere they make a drink®® by steeping corn in the way that %0ahas been already described—they employ the foam®® which %0athickens upon the surface as a leaven: hence it is that %0athe bread in those countries is lighter than that made else¬ %0awhere. %0a%0a3® Panis iiiilitaris 3i To the modius of wheat. %0a%0a33 lie alludes to beer, or sweet-wort.

In Thrace, the stem of %0athe wheat is covered with several coats,^* which are rendered %0aabsolutely necessary by the excessive cold of those regions. %0aIt is the cold, also, that led to the discovery there of the three- %0amonth’® wheat, the ground being covered with snow most %0aot the year. At the end mostly of three months after it has %0abeen sown, this wheat is ready for cutting, both in Thrace and %0ain other parts of the world as well. This variety is well known, %0atoo, throughout all the Alpine range, and in the northern pro¬ %0avinces there is no kind of wheat that is more prolific ; it has %0aa single stem only, is by no means of large size in any part of %0ait, and is never sown but in a thin, light soil. There is a two- %0amonth’® wheat also found in the vicinity of .^Enos, in Thrace, %0aw'hich ripens the fortieth day after sowing; and yet it is a %0asurprising fact, that there is no kind of wheat that weighs %0aheavier than this, while at the same time it produces no bran. %0aBoth Sicily and Achaia grow it, in the mountainous districts %0aof those countries ; as also Euboea, in the vicinity of Carystus. %0aSo greatly, then, is Columella in error,in supposing that %0athere is no distinct variety of three-month wheat even; the %0afact being that these varieties have been known from the very %0aearliest times.

SIMILAGO, OR FINE FLOUR. %0a%0aThere is no grain that display's a greater avidity than wheat, %0aand none that absorbs a greater quantity of nutriment, With %0aall propriety I may justly call winter wheat” the very choicest %0aof all the varieties of wheat. It is white, destitute of all %0aflavour,®® and not oppressive®’ to the stomach. It suits moist %0a%0a’2 Merely, as Fee says, from the faulty method employed in its prepa¬ %0aration, as starch has, in all cases, the same physical appearance. %0a%0a■^2 In c. 17 of this Book.

It was %0aformerly the more general opinion that it was identical with spelt; bat %0athat cannot be the case, as spelt is red, and siligo is described as white. %0a%0aSt* “ Sine virtute."

Winter wheat furnishes bread of the very finest quality %0aand the most esteemed delicacies of the bakers. The best %0abread that is known in Italy is made from a mixture of Cam¬ %0apanian winter wheat with that of Pisae. The Campanian kind %0ais of a redder colour, while the latter is white; when mixed %0awith chalk,®® it is increased in weight. The proper proportion %0afor the yield of Campanian wheat to the modiiis of grain is %0afour sextarii of what is known as bolted fiour;®^ but when it %0ais used in the rough and has not been bolted, then the yield %0ashould be five sextarii of flour. In addition to this, in either %0acase there should be half a modius of Avhite meal, with four %0asextarii of coarse meal, known as “ seconds,” and the same %0aquantity of bran.®® The Pisan Avheat produces five sextarii of %0afine flour to the modius; in other respects it yields the same %0aas that of Campania. The wheat of Clusium and Arretium %0agives another sextarius of fine flour, but the' yield is similar to %0athat of the kinds already mentioned in all other respects. %0aIf, however, as much of it as possible is converted into fine %0awheat meal, the modius will yield sixteen pounds weight of %0awhite bread, and three of seconds, with half a modius of bran. %0aThese differences, however’, depend very materially upon the %0agrinding; for when the grain is ground quite dry it produces %0amore meal, but when sprinkled with salt water®® a whiter %0aflour, though at the same time a greater quantity of bran. It %0ais ver}' evident that “ farina,” the name we give to meal, is %0aderived from “ far.” A modius of meal made from Gallic winter %0a%0aIn other places he says, most unaccountably, that wheat “degenerates %0ainto siligo.” %0a%0aAs to this practice, see c. 29, %0a%0a“ Quam vocant castratam.” %0a%0aFrom this aceount, it would appear that there were twenty-four sex¬ %0atarii to the modius; but the account in general is very contradictory. %0a%0aSalt water is rarely used for this purpose in modern times. See %0athis passage discussed in Beckmann on Inventions, Bohn’s Ed. vol. i. p. %0a164. %0a%0aVOL.

When the bread is baked in the oven,®® two %0apounds must be added in weight in either case. %0a%0a(10.) Wheat yields a fine flour®® of the very highest quality. %0aIn African wheat the modius ought to yield halt a modius of %0afine flour and five sextarii of pollen, that being the name %0agiven to fine wheat meal, in the same way that that of winter %0awheat is generally known as “ flos,” or the “ flower.” This %0afine meal is extensively used in copper works and paper manu¬ %0afactories. In addition to the above, the modius should yield %0afour sextarii of coarse meal, and the same quantity of bran. %0aThe finest wheaten flour will yield one hundred®® and twenty- %0atwo pounds of bread, and the fine meal of winter wheat one %0ahundred®® and seventeen, to the modius of grain. When the %0aprices of grain are moderate, meal sells at forty asses the mo¬ %0adius, bolted wheaten flour at eight asses more, and bolted %0aflour of winter wheat, at sixteen asses more. There is another %0adistinction again in fine wheaten flour, which originated for¬ %0amerly in the days of L. Paulus. There were three classes of %0awheat; the first of which would appear to have yielded seven¬ %0ateen pounds of bread, the second eighteen, and the third nine¬ %0ateen pounds and a third : to these were added two pounds and %0aa half of seconds,®^ and the same quantity of brown®^ bread, %0awith six sextarii of bran.®® %0a%0aWinter wheat never ripens all at once, and yet there is none %0aof the cereals that can so ill brook any delay; it being of so %0adelicate a nature, that the ears directly they are ripe will begin %0ato shed their grain. So long, however, as it is in stalk, it is %0aexposed to fewer risks than other kinds of wheat, from the fact %0a%0a“ Artopticio.” See c. 27 of this Book, %0a%0aWithout tin, probably; or the tin bread may have been baked %0abefore tlie fire, similar to the method adopted at the present day avith the %0aAmerican ovens. %0a%0a“ Similago.” Founders still use meal occasionally for making moulds; %0ait is also employed in making paper. %0a%0aThe mention of “ hundreds” here is evidently faulty, unless the other %0apart of the passage is corrupt. Fee suggests twenty-two and twenty seven. %0a%0aBut above we find him .stating that “secundarius,” “seconds” %0aflour, and “cibarius,” or “coarse,” meal, are the same thing. His con¬ %0atradictions cannot apparently be reconciled. %0a%0a**2 The -whole of this passage, as Brotier remarks, is evidently corrupt. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 21.] %0a%0a%0aWHEAT IN AFBICA. %0a%0a%0a35 %0a%0a%0aof its always having the ear upright, and not retaining the %0adew, which is a prolific cause of mildew. %0a%0aFrom arinca®^ a bread of remarkable sweetness is made. %0aThe grains in this variety lie closer than they do in spelt; the %0aear, too, is larger and more weighty. It is rarely the case %0athat a modius of this grain does not weigh full sixteen pounds. %0aIn Greece they find great difficulty in threshing it; and hence %0ait is that we find Horner®^ saying that it is given to beasts of %0aburden, this being the same as the grain that he calls “ olyra.” %0aIn Egypt it is threshed without any difficulty, and is remark¬ %0aably prolific.

In %0aa similar manner, too, the procurator of JTero sent him three %0ahundred and sixty stalks all issuing from a single grain.® The %0aplains of Leontium in Sicily, and other places in that island, %0aas Avell as the whole of Bsetica, and Egypt more particularly, %0ayield produce a hundred-fold.

In this instrument the iron is %0anotched” at the bottom, sharp ridges running out like the %0aedge of a knife, and concentrating in the form of a star; so %0athat if care is not taken to hold the pestle perpendicularly %0awhile pounding, the grains will only be splintered and the iron %0ateeth broken. Throughout the greater part of Italy, however, %0athey employ a pestle that is only rough” at the end, and %0awheels turned by water, by means of which the corn is gra¬ %0adually ground. I shall here set forth the opinions given by %0aMago as to the best method of pounding corn. He says that %0athe wheat should be steeped first of all in water, and then %0acleaned from the husk; after which it should be dried in the %0asun, and then pounded with the pestle; the same plan, he %0asays, should be adopted in the preparation of barley. In the %0alatter case, however, twenty sextarii of grain require only two %0asextarii of water. When lentils are used, they should be first %0aparched, and then lightly pounded with the bran; or els.e, %0aadopting another method, a piece of unbaked brick and half a %0amodius of sand ” should be added to eveiy twenty sextarii of %0alentils. %0a%0aErvilia should be treated in the same way as lentils. Sesame %0ashould be first steeped in warm water, and then laid out to %0adry, after which it should be rubbed out briskly, and then %0athrown into cold water, so that the chaff maj* be disengaged %0aby floating to the surface. After this is done, the grain should %0aagain be spread out in the sun, upon linen cloths, to dry. Care, %0ahowever, should be taken to lose no time in doing this, as it is %0aapt to turn musty, and assume a dull, livid colour. The grains, %0atoo, which are just cleaned from the husk, require various %0amethods of pounding. When the beard is ground by itself, %0awithout the grain, the result is known as “ acus,”” but it is %0aonly used by goldsmiths.” If, on the other hand, it is beaten %0a%0aThis would rather grate the grain than found it, as Beckmann ob- %0aBerves. See his Hist. Inv., vol. i. pp. 147 and 164, Bohn’s Ed., where the %0ameaning of this passage has been commented upon. Gesner, also, in his %0aLexicon Rusticum, has endeai'oured to explain it. %0a%0aRuido. %0a%0a12 It is surprising to find the Romans, not only kneading their bread %0awith sea-water, but putting in it pounded bricks, clialk, and sand ! %0a%0a1^ Beard chaff"; so called, probably, from the sharpness of the points, %0alike needles (acus). %0a%0a1* See B. xxxiii. c. 3 ; where he says, that afire lighted with this chaflf, %0afuses gold more speedily than one made Avith maple wood. %0a%0a%0a38 %0a%0a%0aPLINY’S NATUBAL HISTQBY. %0a%0a%0a[Book XVIII. %0a%0a%0aout on the threshing-floor, together with the straw, the chaff %0ahas the name of “ palea,” **'*>'*• and in most parts of %0athe world is employed as fodder for beasts of burden. The %0aresidue of millet, panic, and sesame, is known to us as %0a“ apludaj” but in other countries it is called by various other %0anames. %0a%0aCHAP. 24.— MILLET. %0a%0aCampania is particularly prolific in millet, and a fine white %0aporridge is made from it: it makes a bread, too, of remarkable %0asweetness. The nations of Sarmatia live principally on this %0aporridge, and even the raw meal, with the sole addition of %0amares’ milk, or else blood ” extracted from the thigh of the %0ahorse. The .Ethiopians know of no other grain but millet and %0abarley. %0a%0a' CHAP. 25. -PANIC. %0a%0aThe people of Gaul, and of Aquitania more particularly, %0amake use of panic; the same is the case, too, in Italy beyond %0athe Padus, with the addition, however, of the bean, without %0awhich they prepare none of their food. There is no aliment %0aheld in higher esteem than panic by the nations of Pontus. %0aThe other summer grains thrive better in well-watered soils %0athan in rainy localities ; but water is by no means beneficial %0ato millet or panic when they are coming into blade. It is re¬ %0acommended not to sow them among vines or fruit-trees, as it %0ais generally thought that these crops impoverish the soil. %0a%0aCHAP. 26. (11) —THE VABIOHS KINDS OF LEAVEN. %0a%0aMillet is more particularly employed for making leaven; and %0aif kneaded with must,^® it wuU keep a whole year. The same %0ais done, too, with the fine wheat-bran of the best quality; it %0ais kneaded with white must three days old, and then dried in %0athe sun, after which it is made into small cakes. When re¬ %0aquired for making bread, these cakes are first soaked in water. %0a%0aThe Tartars still employ millet as one of their principal articles of %0afood. They also extract a kind of wine from it. %0a%0a1’ Virgil alludes to this, Georg, iii. 463. %0a%0aPanic is still employed more than any other grain in the south of %0aFrance. %0a%0a19 Or grape-juice. _ This must have tended to affect the taste of the %0abread. %0a%0a%0aChap. 27.] THE METHOD OF MAKING BEEAD. %0a%0a%0a39 %0a%0a%0aand then boiled with the finest spelt flour, after which the whole %0ais mixed up with the meal; and it is generally thought that %0athis is the best method of making bread. The Greeks have %0aestablished a rule that for a modius of meal eight ounces of %0aleaven is enough. %0a%0aThese kinds of leaven, however, can only be made at the %0atime of vintage, but there is another leaven which may be pre¬ %0apared with barley and water, at any time it may happen to be %0arequired. It is first made up into cakes of two pounds in %0aweight, and these are then baked upon a hot hearth, or else in %0aan earthen dish upon hot ashes and charcoal, being left till %0athey turn of a reddish brown. When this is done, the cakes %0aare shut close in vessels, until they turn quite sour: Avhen %0awanted for leaven, they are steeped in water first. When %0abarley bread used to be made, it was leavened with the meal %0aof the fitch,or else the chicheling vetch,the proportion %0abeing, two pounds of leaven to two modii and a half of barley %0ameal. At the present day, however, the leaven is prepared %0afrom the meal that is used for making the bread. For this %0apurpose, some of the meal is kneaded before adding the salt, %0aand is then boiled to the consistency of porridge, and left till %0ait begins to turn sour. In most cases, however, they do not %0awarm it at all, but only make use of a little of the dough that %0ahas been kept from the day before. It is very evident that the %0aprinciple which causes the dough to rise is of an acid nature, %0aand it is equally evident that those persons who are dieted %0aupon fermented bread are stronger*^ in body. Among the %0aancients, too, it was generally thought that the heavier wheat %0ais, the more wholesome it is. %0a%0aCHAP. 27 . —THE METHOD OF MAKING BREAD : ORIGIN OP THE ART. %0a%0aIt seems to me quite unnecessary to enter into an account %0aof the various kinds of bread that are made. Some kinds, we %0afind, receive their names from the dishes with which they are %0aeaten, the oyster-bread,-^ for instance: others, again, from %0atheir peculiar delicacy, the artolaganus,^^ or cake-bread, for %0aexample; and others from the expedition with wliich they are %0a%0aErvum, ** “ Cicercula."

The excellence %0aof the finest kinds of bread depends principally on the goodness %0aof the wheat, and the fineness of the bolter. Some persons %0aknead the dough with eggs or milk, and butter even has been %0aemployed for the purpose by nations that have had leisure to %0acultivate the arts of peace, and to give their attention to the %0aart of making pastry. Picenum still maintains its ancient %0areputation for making the bread which it was the first to in¬ %0avent, alica®® being the grain emploj^ed. The flour is kept in %0asoak for nine days, and is kneade^ on the tenth with raisin %0ajuice, in the shape of long rolls; after which it is baked in an %0aoven in earthen pots, till they break. This bread, however, is %0anever eaten till it has been well®^ soaked, which is mostly done %0ain milk mixed with honey. %0a%0aCHAP. 28. -WHEN BAKERS WERE FIRST INTRODUCED AT ROME. %0a%0aThere were no bakers at Pome until the war with King %0aPerseus, more than five hundred and eighty years after the %0abuilding of the City. The ancient Pomans used to make their %0aown bread, it being an occupation which belonged to the wo¬ %0amen, as we see the case in many nations even at the present %0aday. Plautus speaks of the artopta, or bread-tin, in his %0aComedy of the Aulularia,®® though there has been considerable %0adiscussion for that very reason among the learned, whether or %0a%0aFrom aTrevdu), to hasten.

In %0athose times, they had no cooks in the number of their slaves, %0abut used to hire them for the occasion from the market. The %0aGauls were the first to employ the bolter that is made of %0ahorse-hair; while the people of Spain make their sieves and %0ameal-dressers of flax,^® and the Egyptians of papyrus and %0arushes. %0a%0a%0aCHAP. 29 . -AITCA. %0a%0aBut among the very first things of all, we ought to speak of %0athe method employed in preparing alica,^® a most delightful %0aand most wholesome food, and which incontestably confers %0aupon Italy the highest rank among the countries that produce %0athe cereals. This delicacy is prepared, no doubt, in Egypt %0aas well, but of a very inferior quality, and not worth our no¬ %0atice. In Italy, however, it is prepared in numerous places, %0athe territories of Verona and Pisse, :jpr example ; but that of %0aCampania is the most highly esteemed. There, at the foot of %0amountains capped with clouds, runs a plain, not less in all than %0aforty miles in extent. The land here—to give a description %0afirst of the nature of the soil—is dusty on the surface, but %0aspongy below, and as porous as pumice. The inconveniences %0athat generally arise from the close vicinity of mountains are %0ahere converted into so many advantages : for the soil, acting %0aon it as a sort of filter, absorbs the water of the abundant %0arains that fall; the consequence of which is, that the water not %0abeing left to soak or form mud on the surface, the cultivation %0ais greatly facilitated thereby. This land does not return, by %0athe aid of any springs, the moisture it has thus absorbed, but %0athoroughly digests it, by warming it in its bosom, in a heated %0aoven as it were. The ground is kept cropped the whole year %0athrough, once with panic, and twice with spelt; and yet in the %0aspring, when the soil is allowed to have a moment’s repose, %0a%0aWhich in Pliny’s time signified “ baker.” %0a%0aThe Stipa tenacissima of Linnaeus, Fee says; or else the Lygeum %0agpartum of Linnaeus. %0a%0a2"* As to the cereal so called, see c. 10 of this Book. %0a%0a%0a42 %0a%0a%0apLiirr’a natural history. %0a%0a%0a[Book XVIir. %0a%0a%0ait will produce roses more odoriferous by far than the cultivated %0arose: for the earth here is never tired of producing, a circum¬ %0astance in which originated the common saying, that Campania %0aproduces more unguents ” than other countries do oil. %0a%0aIn the same degree, however, that the Campanian soil excels %0athat of all other countries, so does that part of it which is %0aknown to us as Laborise,^® and to the Greeks as Phle^aeum, %0asurpass all the rest. This district is bounded on two sides by %0athe consular high road, which leads from PuteoU to Capua on %0athe one side, and from Cumae on the other. %0a%0aAlica is prepared from the grain called zea, which we have %0aalready mentioned®® as being known to us as “ seed” wheat. %0aThe grain is cleansed in a wooden mortar, for fear lest stone, %0afrom its hardness, should have the effect of grating it. The %0amotive power for raising the pestle, as is generally known, is %0asupplied by slaves working in chains, the end of it being en¬ %0aclosed in a case of iron. After the husks have been removed %0aby this process, the pure grain is broken to pieces, the same %0aimplements being employed. In this way, there are three %0adifferent kinds of alica made, the finest, the seconds, and the %0acoarse, which last is known as “ aphaerema.”'*® Still, however, %0athese various kinds have none of them that whiteness as yet %0afor which they are so distinguished, though even now they are %0apreferable to the Alexandrian alica. With this view—a most %0asingular fact—chalk is mixed with the meal, which, upon %0a%0abecoming well incorporated with it, adds very materially to %0aboth the whiteness and the shortness of the mixture. This %0achalk is found between Puteoli and Neapolis, upon a hill called %0aLeucogaeum ;'‘® and there is still in existence a decree of the %0alate Emperor Augustus, (who established a colony at Capua), %0awhich orders a sum of twenty thousand sesterces to be paid %0aannually from his exchequer to the people of Neapolis, for the %0alease of this hill. His motive for paying this rent, he stated, %0awas the fact that the people of Campania had alleged that it %0aOr perfumed oils. %0a%0a^ See B. iii. c. 9.

In the same hill, sulphur is found as well, and the %0asprings of Araxus issue from its decli'vities, the waters of which %0aare particularly efficacious for strengthening the sight, healing %0awounds, and preventing the teeth from becoming loose. %0a%0aA spurious kind of alica is made, more particularly of a de¬ %0agenerate kind of zea grown in Africa; the ears of it are larger %0aand blacker than those of the genuine kind, and the straw is %0ashort. This grain is pounded with sand, and even then it is %0awith the greatest difficulty that the outer coats are removed; %0awhen stripped, the grain fills one half only of the original %0ameasure. Gypsum, in the proportion of one fourth, is then %0asprinkled over it, and after the mixture has been well incor¬ %0aporated, it is bolted through a meal-sieve. The portion that %0aremains behind, after this is done, is known as “ excepticia,”^® %0aand consists of the coarser parts; while that which has passed %0athrough is submitted to a second process, with a finer sieve ; %0aand that which then refuses to pass has the name of “secun- %0adaria.”‘® That, again, which, in a similar manner, is submitted %0ato a third sifting, with a sieve of the greatest fineness, which %0awill only admit of sand passing through it, is known as “ cri- %0abraria,”^'' when it remains on the top of the sieve. %0a%0aThere is another method, again, that is employed every %0awhere for adulterating it. They pick out the whitest and %0alargest grains of wheat, and parboil them in earthen pots; these %0aare then dried in the sun till they have regained their original, %0asize, after which they are lightly sprinkled with water, and %0athen ground in a mill. A better granaeum ^ is made from zea %0athan from wheat, although it is nothing else, in fact, but a %0aspurious alica: it is whitened by the addition of boiled milk, %0ain place of chalk. %0a%0aCHAP. 30.

Bean meal is kuown as “lomentum;” and, as is %0athe case with the meal of all leguminous plants, it adds con¬ %0asiderably, when mixed with flour, to the weight of the bread. %0aBeans are on sale at the present day for numerous purposes, %0aand are employed for feeding cattle, and man more particu¬ %0alarly. They are mixed, also, among most nations, with %0awheat,®® and panic more particularly, either whole or lightly %0abroken. In our ancient ceremonials, too, bean pottage®^ occu¬ %0apies its place in the religious services of the gods. Beans are %0amostly eaten together with other food, but it is generally %0athought that they dull the senses, and cause sleepless nights %0aattended Avith dreams. Hence it is that the bean has been %0acondemned®* by Pythagoras; though, according to some, the %0areason for this denunciation was the belief Avhich he enter¬ %0atained that the souls of the dead are enclosed in the bean: it %0ais for this reason, too, that beans are used in the funereal ban¬ %0aquets of the Parentalia.®® According to Varro, it is for a %0asimilar cause that the Flamen abstains from eating beans : in %0aaddition to which, on the blossom of the bean, there are cer¬ %0atain letters of ill omen to be found. %0a%0aThere are some peculiar religious usages connected with the %0abean. It is the custom to bring home from the harvest a bean %0aby way of auspice, which, from that circumstance, has the %0aname of “ referiva.”®^ In sales by public auction, too, it is %0athought lucky to include a bean in the lot for sale. It is a %0afact, too, that the bean is the only one among all the grains %0athat fills out at the increase of the moon,®® however much it %0amay have been eaten away: it can never be thoroughly boiled %0ain sea-water, or indeed any other water that is salt. %0a%0aThe Faba vulgaris of the modern naturalists.

Virgil^ recommends that %0ait should be sown in spring, according to the usage of the parts %0aof Italj near the Padus: but most people prefer the bean that %0ahas been sown early to that of only three months’ growth; %0afor, in the former case, the pods as well as the stalk afibid a %0amost agreeable fodder for cattle. When in blossoiii more par¬ %0aticularly, the bean requires water; but after the blossom has %0apassed off, it stands in need of but very little. It fertilizes®^ %0athe grouud in which it has been sown as well as any manure; %0ahence it is that in the neighbourhood of Thessaly and Ma¬ %0acedonia, as soon 'as it begins to blossom, they turn up®® the %0aground. %0a%0aThe bean, too, grows wild in most countries, as in those %0aislands of the Northern Ocean, for instance, which for that %0areason have been called by us the “Pabarige.”®® In Mauritania, %0aalso, it is found in a wild state in various parts, but so remark¬ %0aably hard that it will never become soft by boiling. %0a%0aIn Egypt there is a kind of bean®® which grows upon a %0athorny stalk; for which reason the crocodiles avoid it, being %0aapprehensive of danger to their eyes. This stalk is four %0acubits in length, and its thickness, at the very most, that of %0athe finger : were it not for the absence of articulations in it, %0ait would resemble a soft reed in appearance. The head is %0asimilar to that of the poppy, being of a rose colour : the beans %0aenclosed in this head are not above thirty in number; the %0aleaves are large, and the fruit is bitter and odoriferous. The %0aroot, however, is highly esteemed by the natives as a food, %0awhether eaten raw or well boiled ; it bears a strong resem¬ %0ablance to that of the reed. This plant grows also in Syria %0aand Cilicia, and upon the banks of Lake Torone in Chalcidice. %0a%0a*%3c5 Georg, i. 215. %0a%0aTliis notion still prevails, and tlie bean, while in blossom, is dug into %0athe ground to manure it, both in England and France. %0a%0aIt docs not appear, however, that this was done with the view of %0adigging in the beans. %0a%0aOr Bean Islands.

The %0alentil thrives best in a soil that is rather thin than rich, and %0amostly stands in need of dry weather. There are tw’^o kinds %0aof lentil grown in Egypt; one of which is rounder and blacker %0athan the other, which has a peculiar shape of its own. The %0aname of this plant has been applied to various uses, and %0aamong others has given origin to our word “ lenticula.” I %0afind it stated in some authors that a lentil diet is productive of %0aevenness of temper. The pea requires to be sown in a warm, %0asunny spot, and is ill able to endure cold ; hence in Italy and %0athe more rigorous climates, it is sown in the spring only, a light, %0aloose soil being chosen for the purpose. %0a%0aCHAP. 32. —THE SEVERAL KINDS OF CHICK-PEASE. %0a%0aThe chick-pea®’ is naturally salt,®' for which reason it is apt %0ato scorch the ground, and should only be sown after it has %0abeen steeped a day in water. This plant presents consider¬ %0aable differences in reference to size, colour,®® form, and taste. %0aOne variety resembles in shape a ram’s head, from which cir¬ %0acumstance it has received the name of “ arietinumthere %0aare both the white and the black arietinum. There is also the %0acolumbine chick-pea, by some known as the “pea of Venus;” %0ait is white, round, and smooth, being smaller than the arie¬ %0atinum, and is employed in the observances of the night festivals %0aor vigils. The chicheling vetch,®® too, is a diminutive kind of %0achick-pea, unequal and angular, like®' the pea. The chick¬ %0apea that is the sweetest in flavour is the one that bears the %0aclosest resemblance to the fitch; the pod in the black and the %0ared kinds is more firmly closed than in the white ones. %0a%0aPisum sativum of Linnaeus. %0a%0aMeaning a wart or pimple on the face. %0a%0aCicer arietinum of the botanists. %0a%0a61 « Gigni cum salsilagine.” It abounds in India, and while blossom¬ %0aing, it distils a corrosive acid, which corrodes the shoes of those who tread %0aupon it. %0a%0aThere are still the red and the white kinds, the large and the small %0a%0aCicercula: the Lathyrus sativus of Linnaeus.

In %0athe case of the kidney-bean®'* it is usual t* eat the pod together %0awith the seed. This last may be sown in all kinds of soils %0aindifferently, between the ides of October®® and the calends of %0aNovember.''® As soon as ever the leguminous plants begin to %0aripen, they ought to be plucked, for the pods will very soon %0aopen and the seed fall out, in which case it is very difficult to %0afind ; the same is the case, too, with the lupine. But before %0awe pass on to the lupine, it will be as well to make some men¬ %0ation of the rape.” %0a%0aCHAP. 34. (13.) —THE EAPE. %0a%0aThe Latin writers have only treated of this plant in a cur¬ %0asor}' manner, while those of Greece have considered it a little %0amore attentively ; though even they have ranked it among the %0agarden plants. If, however, a methodical arrangement is to %0abe strictly observed, it should be spoken of immediately after %0acorn, or the bean, at all events; for next to these two produc¬ %0ations, there is no plant that is of more extensive use. Bor, in %0athe first place, all animals will feed upon it as it grows; and %0ait is far from being the least nutritious plant in the fields for %0avarious kinds of birds, when boiled in water more particularly. %0aCattle, too, are remarkably fond of the leaves of rape; and %0athe stalks and leaves, when in season, are no less esteemed %0aas a food for man than the sprouts of the cabbagethese, %0atoo, when turned yellow and left to die in the barn, are even %0amore highly esteemed than''- when green. As to the rape %0aitself, it will keep all the better if left in its mould, after which %0ait should be dried in the open air till the next crop is nearly %0aripe, as a resource in case of scarcity.

The rape is by no means %0adifficult to please in soil, for it will grow almost anywhere, %0aindeed where nothing else can be sown. It readily derives %0anutriment from fogs and hoar-frosts, and grows to a marvel¬ %0alous size ; I have seen them weighing upwards of forty pounds. %0a%0aIt is prepared for table among us iu several ways, and is made %0ato keep till the next crop, its fermentation’'^ being prevented by %0apreserving it in mustard. It is also tinted with no less than %0asix colours in addition to its own, and with purple even; in¬ %0adeed, that which is used by us as food ought to be of no other %0acolour.’'® %0a%0aThe Greeks have distinguished two principal species of rape, %0athe male and the female,™ and have discovered a method of ob¬ %0ataining them b'oth from the same seed; for when it is sown thick, %0aor in a hard, cloggy soU, the produce will be male. The smaller %0athe seed the better it is in quality. There are three kinds of %0arape in all; the first is broad and flat, the second of a spherical %0ashape, and the third, to which the name of “ wild” rape” %0ahas been given, throws out a long root, similar in appearance %0ato a radish, with an angular, rough leaf, and an acrid juice, %0awhich, if extracted about harvest, and mixed with a woman’s %0amilk, is good for cleansing the eyes and improving defective %0asight. The colder the weather the sweeter they are, and the %0alarger, it is generally thought; heat makes them run to leaf. %0aThe finest rape of all is that grown in the district of Isiirsk: %0ait is valued at as much as one sesterce’'® per pound, and, in %0atimes of scarcity, two even.

The more careful growers recommend %0athat the ground should be turned up five times before putting %0ain the turnip, and four for rape, care being taken, in both %0acases, to manure it well. Eape, they say, will thrive all the %0abetter, if it is sown together with some chaff. They will %0ahave it, too, that the sower ought to be stripped, and that he %0ashould offer up a prayer while sowing, and say : “ I sow this %0afor myself and for my neighbours.” The proper time for sow¬ %0aing both kinds is the period that intervenes between the festi¬ %0avals*" of the two divinities, Neptune and Vulcan. It is said, %0atoo—and it is the result of very careful observatidh—that %0athese plants will thrive wonderfully well, if they are sown as %0amanj’ days after the festival of Neptune as the moon was old %0awhen the first snow fell the previous winter. They are sown %0ain spring as well, in warm and humid localities. %0a%0aCHAP. 36. (14.) —THE LUPINE. %0a%0aThe lupine is the next among the leguminous plants that %0ais in extensive use, as it serves for food for man in common %0awith the hoofed quadrupeds. To prevent it from springing %0aout of the pod®* while being gathered, and so lost, the best %0aplan is to gather it immediately after a shower. Of all the %0aseeds that are sown, there is not one of a more marvellous na¬ %0ature than this, or more favoured by the earth. First of all, %0ait turns every day with the sun,®® and shows the hour to the %0ahusbandman, even though the weather should happen to be %0acloudy and overcast. It blossoms, too, no less than three %0atirnes, and so attached is it to the earth, that it does not re¬ %0aquire to be covered wdth the soil; indeed, this is the only seed %0athat does not require the earth to be turned up for sowing it. %0aIt thrives more particularly on a sandy, dry, and even gravelly %0asoil; and requires n© further care to be taken in its cultiva¬ %0ation. To such a degree is it attached to the earth, that even %0a%0a1 st of March. %0a%0a•0 The Neptunalia and the Vulcanalia; 23rd of July and 23rd of %0aAugust. %0a%0aIn consequence of the brittleness of the pod. %0a%0aThis is an exaggeration of certain phaenomena observed in the leave# %0aof all leguminous plants. %0a%0a%0a50 %0a%0a%0aFlint’s natuhal history. %0a%0a%0a[Book XVIII. %0a%0a%0athough left upon a soil thickly covered with brambles, it will %0athrow out a root amid the leaves and brakes, and so con¬ %0atrive to reach the ground. We have already stated*^ that the %0asoil of a field or vineyard is enriched by the growth of a %0acrop of lupines; indeed, so far is it from standing in need of %0amanure, that the lupines will act upon it as well as the very %0abest. It is the only seed that requires no outlay at all, so %0amuch so, in fact, that there is no necessity to carry it even to the %0aspot where it is sown ; for it may be sown the moment it is %0abrought from the threshing-floor and from the fact that it %0afalls fi’om the pod of its own accord, it stands in need of no %0aone to scatter it. %0a%0aThisfs®® the very first grain sown and the last that is gathered, %0aboth operations generally taking place in the month of Sep¬ %0atember ; indeed, if this is not done before winter sets in, it is %0aliable to receive injury from the cold. And then, besides, it %0amay even be left with impunity to lie upon the ground, in case %0ashowers should not immediately ensue and cover it in, it being %0aquite safe from the attacks of all animals, on account of its %0abitter taste : still, however, it is mostly covered up in a slight %0afurrow. Among the thicker soils, it is attached to a red earth %0amore particularly. In order to enrich**® this earth, it should be %0aturned up just after the third blossom ; but where the soil is %0asandy, after the second. Chalky and slimy soils are the only %0aones that it lias an aversion to; indeed, it will never come to %0aanything when sown in them. Soaked in warm water, it is %0aused as a food, too, for man. One modius is a sufficient meal %0afor an ox, and it is found to impart considerable vigour to %0acattle; placed, too, upon the abdomen®^ of children, it acts as %0aa remedy in certain cases. It is an excellent plan to season %0athe lupine by smoking it; for when it is kept in a moist state, %0amaggots are apt to attack the germ, and render it useless for %0areproduction. If cattle have eaten it off Avhile in leaf, as a %0amatter of necessity it should be ploughed in as soon as possible. %0a%0aIn B. xvii. c. 6. %0a%0a** “ El area.” This reading is favoured by the text of Columella.

Plant. B. viii. c. 1. 11, &c. %0a%0aIt is still thought that the lupine enriches the soil in which it grows. %0a%0aMarcellus Empiricus says, that boiled lupine meal, spread as a plaster, %0aand laid on the abdomen, will destroy intestinal worms. %0a%0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 39.] %0a%0a%0aBILICIA. %0a%0a%0a51 %0a%0a%0aCHAP. 37, (15.) —THE VETCH. %0a%0aThe vetch,®® too, enriches the soil, and its cultivation en¬ %0atails no labour on the agriculturist. It is sown after the %0aground has been but once turned up, and requires neither hoe- %0aing nor manuring; nothing at all, indeed', except harrowing. %0aThere are three periods for sowing it; the first is about the %0asetting of Arcturus, when it is intended for feeding cattle %0ain the month of December, while in the blade ; this crop, too, %0ais the best of all for seed, for, although grazed upon, it will %0abear just as well. The second crop is sown in the month of %0aJanuary, and the last in March ; this last being the best crop %0afor fodder. Of all the seeds this is the one that thrives best %0ain a dry soil; still, however, it manifests no repugnance to %0aa shaded locality. This grain, if gathered when quite ripe, %0aproduces a chaff superior to that of any other. If sown near %0avines supported by trees, the vetch will draw away the juices %0afi'om the vines, and make them languid. %0a%0aCHAP. 38. -THE FITCH. %0a%0aThe cultivation of the fitch,®® too, is attended with no diffi¬ %0aculty. It requires weeding, however, more than the vetch. %0aLike it, the fitch has certain medicinal®® properties; for we %0afind the fact still kept in remembrance by some letters of his, %0athat the late Empei’or Augustus was cured by its agency. Five %0amodii will sow as much ground as a yoke of oxen can plough %0ain a day. If sown in the month of March,®* it is injurious, %0athey say, to oxen : and when sown in autumn, it is apt to pro¬ %0aduce head-ache. If, however, it is put in the ground at the %0abeginning of spring, it will be productive of no bad results. %0a%0aCHAP. 39.

Varro ^ informs us that it received its name %0aon account of the celerity with which it springs up, from the %0aGreek uKsug, “ quickly.” %0a%0aCHAP. 43.- LUCERNE. %0a%0aLucerne ^ is by nature an exotic to Greece even, it having %0abeen first introduced into that country from Media,® at the time %0aof the Persian wars with King Darius ; still it deserves to be %0amentioned among the very first of these productions. So su¬ %0aperior are its qualities, that a single sowing will last more %0athan thirty^ years. It resembles trefoil in appearance, but the %0astalk and leaves are articulated. The longer it grows in the %0astalk, the narrower is the leaf. Amphilochus has devoted a %0awhole book to this subject and the cytisus.® The ground in %0awhich it is sown, being first cleaned and cleared of stones, is %0aturned up in the autumn, after which it is ploughed and har¬ %0arowed. It is then harrowed a second and a third time, at in¬ %0atervals of five days ; after which manure is laid upon it. This %0aseed requires either a soil that is dry, but full of nutriment, or %0aelse a well-watered one. After the ground has been thus pre¬ %0apared, the seed is put in in the month of May ;® for if sown %0aearlier, it is in danger from the frosts. It is necessary to sow %0athe seed verj' thick, so that all the ground may be occupied, %0aand no room left for weeds to shoot up in the intervals ; a %0aresult which may be secured by sowing twenty modii to the %0ajugerum. The seed must be stirred at once with the rake, to %0aprevent the sun from scorching it, and it should be covered %0aover with earth as speedily as possible. If the soil is naturally %0adamp or weedy, the lucerne will be overpowered, and the spot %0a%0aFee suggests that this may he the Avena sterilis, or else the Avena %0afatua of Linnajus. %0a%0a* De Re Rust.

It %0ashould be hoed in the spring, and cleared of all other plants; %0aand in the third year the surface should be well worked with %0athe weeding-hook. By adopting this method, the weeds will %0abe eff'ectually destroyed, though without detriment to the lu- %0acerne, in consequence of the depth of its roots. If the w'eeds %0ashould happen to get ahead of it, the only remedy is to turn it %0aup repeatedly with the plough, until the roots of the weeds are %0athoroughly destroyed. This fodder should never be given to %0acattle to satiety, otherwise it may be necessary to let blood; it %0ais best, too, when used while green. When dry, it becomes %0atough and ligneous, and falls away at last into a thin, useless %0adust.

It remains for us %0anow to complete our account of all the cereals, and we shall %0ahere devote a portion of it to the diseases to which they are %0asubject. %0a%0aCHAP. 44 . ( 17 .) —THE DISEASES OF GRAIN :>THE OAT. %0a%0a■ The foremost feature of disease in wheat is the oat.® Barley, %0atoo, will degenerate into the oat; so much so, in fact, that the %0aoat has become an equivalent for corn; for the people of Ger¬ %0amany are in the habit of sowing it, and make their porridge of %0anothing else. This degeneracy is owing more particularly to %0ahumidity of soil and climate; and a second cause is a weakness in %0athe seed, the result of its being retained too long in the ground %0abefore it makes its appearance above it. The same, too, will %0a%0a’’ By the aid of careful watering, as many as eight to fourteen cuttings %0aare obtained in the year, in Italy and Spain. In the north of Europe %0athere is but one crop. %0a%0a® In B. xiii. c. 47. %0a%0a9 He borrows this notion of the oat being wheat in a diseased state, %0afrom Theophrastus. Singularly enough, it was adopted by the learned %0aBuffon. %0a%0a%0aChap. 44.] %0a%0a%0aTHE DISEASES OE QBAIN. %0a%0a%0a55 %0a%0a%0abe the consequence, if the seed is decayed when put in the %0aground. This may be known, however, the moment it makes %0aits appearance, from which it is quite evident, that the defect %0alies in the root. There is another form of disease, too, which %0aclosely resembles the oat, and which supervenes when the %0agrain, already developed to its full size, hut not ripe, is struck %0aby a noxious blast, before it has acquired its proper body and %0astrength; in this case, the seed pines away in the ear, by a %0akind of abortion, as it were, and totally disappears. %0a%0aThe wind is injurious to wheat and barley, at three'® periods %0aof the year in particular: when they are in blossom, directly %0athe blossom has passed off, and just as the seed is beginning to %0aripen. In this last case, the grain wastes away, while in the %0atwo former ones it is prevented from being developed. Gleams %0aof sunshine, every now and then, from the midst of clouds, %0aare injurious to corn. Maggots, too, breed ” in the roots, when %0athe rains that follow the seed-time are succeeded by a sudden %0aheat, which encloses the humidity in the ground. Maggots %0amake their appearance,’^ also, in the grain, when the ear fer¬ %0aments through heat succeeding a fall of rain. There is a small %0abeetle, too, known by the name of “ cantharis,”'® which eats %0aaway the blade. All these insects die, however, as soon as %0atheir nutriment fails them. Oil,’* pitch, and grease are pre¬ %0ajudicial to grain, and care should be taken not to let them come %0ain contact with the seed that is sown. Eain is only beneficial %0ato grain while in the blade ; it is injurious to wheat and barley ' %0awhile they are in blossom, but is not detrimental to the legu¬ %0aminous plants, with the exception of the chick-pea. When %0agrain is beginning to ripen, rain is injurious, and to barley in %0aparticular. There is a white grass that grows in the fields, %0avery similar to panic in appearance, but fatal to cattle. As to %0a%0a10 From Theophrastus, Hist. Plant. B. viii. c. 10. %0a%0a'* This but rarely happens in our climates, as Fee remarks. %0a%0aIll The grains are sometimes, though rarely, foimd devoured on the %0astalk, by a kind of larvae. %0a%0a'0 Some coleopterous insect, probably, now unknown, and not the Can- %0atharis vesicatoria, or “ Spanish fly,” as some have imagined. Diosco- %0arides and Athenaeus state to the same effect as Pliny. %0a%0aThe proper influence of the humidity of the earth would naturally %0abe impeded by a coating of these substances. %0a%0aThis plant has not been identified; but none of the gramineous %0aplants are noxious to cattle, with the exception of the seed of darnel. %0a%0a%0a56 %0a%0a%0aPliny's natueal histohy. %0a%0a%0a[Book XVIII. %0a%0a%0adarnel,'*’ the tribulus,” the thistle,'* and the burdock,'® I can %0aconsider them, no more than the bramble, among the maladies %0athat attack the cereals, but rather as so raan}'^ pests inflicted on %0athe earth. Mildew,*® a malady resulting from the inclemency %0aof the weather, and equally attacking the A’ine *' and corn, is %0ain no degree less injurious. It attacks corn most frequently in %0alocalities which are exposed to dews, and in vallies which have %0anot a thorough draught for the wind ; windy and elevated %0aspots, on the other hand, are totally exempt from it. Another %0aevil, again, in corn, is over-luxuriance, when it falls to the %0aground beneath the weight ** of the grain. One evil, however, %0ato which all crops in common, the chick-pea even, are exposed, %0ais the attacks of the caterpillar, when the rain, by washing %0aaway the natural saltness of the vegetation, makes it** all the %0amore tempting for its sweetness. %0a%0aThere is a certain plant,too, which kills the chick-pea and %0athe fitch, by twining around them ; the name of it is “ oro- %0abanche.” In a similar manner, also, wheat is attacked by %0adarnel,*® barley by a long-stalked plant, called “ aegilops,”*® and %0athe lentil by an axe-leafed grass, to which, from the resem¬ %0ablance*' of the leaf, the Greeks have given the name of “pele- %0acinon.” All these plants, too, kill the others by entwining %0aaround them. In the neighbourhood of Philippi, there is a %0aplant known as ateramon,*® which grows in a rich soil, and %0a%0aLolium temulentum of Linnajus.

If intro¬ %0aduced into bread, it will speedily produce vertigo; and it is %0asaid that in Asia and Greece, the bath-keepers, when they want %0ato dispense a crowd of people, throw this seed upon burning %0acoals. The phalangium, a diminutive insect of the spider %0agenus,'” breeds in the fitch, if the winter happens to be wet. %0aSlugs, too, breed in the vetch, and sometimes a tiny snail makes %0aits way out of the ground, and eats it away in a most singular %0amanner. %0a%0aThese are pretty nearly all the maladies to which grain is %0asubject. %0a%0aCHAP. 45 . -THE BEST REMEDIES FOR THE DISEASES OF GRAIN. %0a%0aThe best remedy for these maladies, so long as grain is in %0athe blade, is the weeding-hook, and, at the moment of sowing, %0aashes.As to those diseases which develope themselves in the %0aseed and about the root, with due care precautions may be ef¬ %0afectually employed against them. It is generally supposed that %0aif seed has been first steeped in wine,®‘ it will be less exposed %0ato disease. Yirgil recommends that beans should be drenched %0awith nitre and amurca of olives; and he says that if this is %0adone, they will be all the larger. Some persons, again, are of %0aopinion, that they will grow of increased size, if the seed is %0asteeped for three days before it is sown in a solution of urine %0aand water. If the ground, too, is hoed three times, a modius %0aof beans in the pod, they say, wifi, yield not less than a modius %0a%0athe vicinity of Philippi makes the beans difficult to cook or boil, arepdfiovfQ. %0aFrom this word he has coined two imaginary plants, the “ateramon,” %0aand the “ teramon.” Ilardouin defends Pliny, by suggesting that he has %0aborrowed the passage from another source, while Fee doubts if he really %0aunderstood the Greek language. %0a%0aMore probably one of the Coleoptera. He borrows from Theo¬ %0aphrastus, Hist. Anim. B. viii. c. 10. %0a%0aThis will only prevent the young plants from becoming a prey to %0asnails and slugs. %0a%0aThis plan is attended with no good results. %0a%0aGeorg, i. 193. It is generally said that if seed is steeped in a solu¬ %0ation of nitre, and more particularly hydrochloric acid, it will germinate %0awith accelerated rapidity; the produce, however, is no finer than at other %0atimes. %0a%0a%0a58 %0a%0a%0aPliny’s natueal histoey. %0a%0a%0a[Book XVIII. %0a%0a%0aof shelled beans. Other seeds, again, it is said, will be %0aexempt from the attacks of maggots, if bruised C3’press^ leaves %0aare mixed with them, or if the}' are sown just at the moon’s %0aconjunction. Many persons, for the more effectual protection %0aof millet, recommend that a bramble-frog should be carried at %0anight round the field before the hoeing is done, and then buried %0ain an earthen vessel in the middle of it. If this is done, they %0asay, neither sparrows nor worms will attack the crop. The %0afrog, however, must be disinterred before the millet is cut; for %0aif this is neglected, the produce Avill be bitter. It is pretended, %0atoo, that all seeds which have been touched by the shoulders %0aof a mole are remarkably productive. %0a%0aDemocritus recommends that all seeds before they are sown %0ashould be steeped in the juice of the herb known as “ aizoum,”“ %0awhich grows on tiles or shingles, and is known to us by the %0aLatin name of " sedum” or “ digitellum.”^® If blight pre¬ %0avails, or if .worms are found adhering to the roots, it is a very %0acommon rem.edy to sprinkle the plants with pure amurca of %0aolives without salt, and then to hoe the ground. If, however, %0athe crop should be beginning to joint, it should be stubbed at %0aonce, for fear lest the weeds should gain the upper hand. I %0aknow for certain*’ that flights of starlings and sparrows, those %0apests to millet and panic, are effectually driven away by means %0aof a certain herb, the name of which is unknown to me, being %0aburied at the four corners of the field: it is a wonderful thing %0ato relate, but in such case not a single bird will enter it. Mice %0aare kept away by the ashes of a weasel or a cat being steeped %0ain water and then thrown upon the seed, or else by using the %0awater in w hich the body of a weasel or a eat has been boiled. %0aThe odour, however, of these animals makes itself perceived %0ain the bread even; for which reason it is generally thought a %0abetter plan to steep the seed in ox-gaU.*® As for mildew, %0athat greatest curse of all to corn, if branches of laurel ure %0a%0a33 “FracttE.” Perhaps, more properly “crushed.” %0a%0aThe odour of cypress, or savin.

Over-luxuriance in corn is repressed by %0athe teeth of cattle,®® but only while it is in the blade; in which %0acase, if depastured upon ever so often, no injury to it when %0ain the ear will be the result. If the ear, too, is once cut oif, %0athe grain, it is well known, will assume a larger^*^ form, but %0awill be hollow within and worthless, and if sown, will come %0ato nothing. %0a%0aAt Babylon, however, they cut the blade twice, and then %0alet the cattle pasture on it a third time, for otherwise it would %0arun to nothing but leaf. Even then, however, so fertile is the %0asoil, that it yields fifty, and, indeed, with care, as much as a %0ahundred, fold. Hor is the cultivation of it attended with any %0adifficulty, the only object being to let the ground be under %0awater as long as possible, in order that the extreme richness %0aand exuberance of the soil may be modified. The Euphrates, %0ahowever, and the Tigris do not deposit a slime, in the same %0away that the ISTilus does in Egypt, nor does the soil produce %0avegetation spontaneously ; but still, so great is the fertility, %0athat, although the seed is only trodden in with the foot, a crop %0asprings up spontaneously the following year, go great a dif¬ %0aference in soils as this, reminds me that I ought to take this %0aopportunity of specifying those which are the best adapted %0afor the various kinds of grain. %0a%0aCHAP. 46 . —THE CHOPS THAT SHOULD BE SOWN IN THE DIFFERENT %0aSOILS. %0a%0aThis, then, is the opinion expressed by Cato'*' on the subject: %0a“ In a dense and fertile soil wheat should be sown: but if the %0alocality is subject to fogs, rape, radishes, millet, and panic. %0aWhere the land*® is cold and moist, sowing should be com¬ %0amenced earlier ; but where it is hot, at a later period. In a %0ared, black, or gravelly soil, provided it is not watery, lupines %0ashould be sown; but in chalk, red earth, or a watery soil, %0aspelt.*® Where a locality is dry, free from weeds, and not %0aovershadowed, wheat should be put in ; and where the soil is %0a%0a39 Virgil, Georg, i.

Barley is %0aequally suited for fallow land and for a soil that is not intended %0ato be follow, and three-month wheat, for a soil upon which a %0acrop of ordinary wheat would never ripen, but strong enough %0ato bear.” %0a%0aThe following, too, is sound advice Those plants should %0abe sown in a thin soil which do not stand in need of much %0anutriment, the cytisus, for instance, and such of the leguminous %0aplants, with the exception of the chick-pea, as are taken up %0aby the roots and not cut. From this mode of gathering them %0a—“ legere”—the legumina derive their name. Where it is a %0arich earth, those plants should be grown which require a %0agreater proportion of nutriment, coleworts for instance, wheat, %0awinter-wheat, and flax. The result, then, will be, that a %0alight soil will be given to barley—the root of that grain stand¬ %0aing in need of less nutriment—while a more dense, though %0aeasily-worked soil, will be assigned to wheat. In humid loca¬ %0alities spelt should be sown in preference to wheat; but where %0athe soil is of moderate temperature, either wheat or barley %0amay be grown. Declivities produce a stronger growth of %0awheat, but in smaller quantities. Spelt and winter-wheat %0aadopt a moist, cretaceous soil in preference to any other. %0a%0a(18.) The only occasion on which there ever was a prodigy %0aconnected with grain, at least that I am aware of, was in the %0aconsulship of P.

In that country, performing the %0aduties of the husbandman, the Nile begins to overflow, as %0aalready stated,^^ immediately after the summer solstice or the %0anew moon, gradually at first, but afterwards with increased %0aimpetuosity, as long as the sun remains in the sign of Leo. %0aWhen the sun has passed into Yirgo, the impetuosity of the %0aoverflow begins to slacken, and when he has entered Libra the %0ariver subsides. Should it not have exceeded twelve cubits in %0aits overflow, famine is the sure result; and this is equally the %0acase if it should chance to exceed sixteen; for the higher it %0ahas risen, the more slowly it subsides, and, of course, the seed¬ %0atime is impeded in proportion. It was formerly a very general %0abelief that immediately upon the subsiding of the waters the %0aEgyptians were in the habit of driving herds of swine over %0athe ground, for the purpose of treading the seed into the moist %0asoil—and it is my own impression that this was done in ancient %0atimes. At the present day even, tlie operation is not attended %0awith much greater labour. It is well known, however, that %0athe seed is first laid upon the slime that has been left by the %0ariver on its subsidence, and then ploughed in; this being done %0aat the beginning of November. After this is done, a few per¬ %0asons are employed in stubbing, an operation known there as %0a“ botanismos.” The rest of the labourers, however, have no %0aoccasion to visit the land again tiU a little before the calends %0aof April,** and then it is with the reaping-hook. The harvest %0ais completed in the month of May. The stem is never so %0amuch as a cubit in length, as there is a stratum of sand be¬ %0aneath the slime, from which last alone the grain receives its %0asupport. The best wheat of all is that of the region of %0aThebais, Egypt** being of a marshy character. %0a%0aThe method adopted at Seleucia in Babylonia is very similar %0ato this, but the fertility there is still greater, owing to the %0aoveiHow of the Euphrates and Tigris,®* the degree of irriga¬ %0ation being artificially modified in those parts.

Another kind— %0athe common plough-share—is nothing more than a lever, fur¬ %0anished with a pointed bealc; while another variety, which is only %0aused in light, easy soils, does not present an edge projecting from %0athe share-beam throughout, but only a small point at the ex¬ %0atremity. In a fourth kind again, this point is larger and formed %0awith a cutting edge ; by the agency of which implement, it %0aboth cleaves the ground, and, with the sharp edges at the sides, %0acuts up the weeds by the roots. There has been invented, at a %0acomparatively recent period, in that part of Gaul®® known as %0aKhmtia, a plough with the addition of two small wheels, and %0aknown by the name of “ plaumorati.”®^ The extremity of the %0ashare in this has the form of a spade : it is only used, however, %0afor sowing in cultivated lands, and upon soils which are nearly %0afallow. The broader the plough-share, the better it is for %0aturning up the clods of earth. Immediately after ploughing, %0athe seed is put into the ground, and then harrows®® with long %0ateeth are drawn over it. Lands which have been sown in this %0away require no hoeing, but two or three pairs of oxen are em¬ %0aployed in ploughing. It is a fair estimate to consider that a %0asingle yoke of oxen can work forty jugera of land in the year, %0awhere the soil is light, and thirty where it is stubborn. %0a%0aCHAP. 49.

Good ploughing. What is the %0asecond point? Ploughing again. What is the third point? %0aManuring. Take care not to make crooked furrows. Be %0acareful to plough at the proper time.” In warm localities it %0ais necessary to open the ground immediately after the winter %0asolstice, but where it is cold, directly after the vernal equinox : %0athis, too, should be done sooner in dry districts than in wet ones, %0ain a dense soil than a loose one, in a rich land than a meagre %0aone. In countries where the summers are hot and oppressive, %0athe soil cretaceous or thin, it is the best plan to plough between %0atlie summer solstice and the autumnal equinox. Where, on %0athe other hand, the heat is moderate, with frequent falls of rain, %0aand the soil rich and full of vegetation, the ploughing should %0abe done during the prevalence of the heat. A deep, heavy %0asoil, again, should be ploughed in winter; but one that is very %0athin and dr}’, only just before putting in the seed. %0a%0aTillage, too, has its own particular rules®®—N^ever touch the %0aground while it is wet and cloggy ; plough with all your might; %0aloosen the ground before you begin to plough. This method %0ahas its advantages, for by turning up the clods the roots of the %0aweeds are killed. Some persons recommend that in every case %0athe ground should be turned up immediately after the vernal %0aequinox. Land that has been ploughed once in spring, from %0athat circumstance has the namecf “ vervactum.”®’ This, too, %0ais equally necessary in the case of fallow land, by which term %0ais meant land that is sown only in alternate years The oxen %0aemployed in ploughing should be harnessed as tightly as pos¬ %0asible, to make them plough with their heads up; attention %0apaid to this point will prevent them from galling the neck. If %0ait is among trees and vines that you are ploughing, the oxen %0ashould be muzzled, to prevent them from eating off the tender %0abuds. There should be a small bill-hook, too, projecting from %0athe plough-tail, for the purpose of cutting up the roots; this %0aplan being preferable to that of turning them up with the share, %0aand so straining the oxen. When ploughing, finish the furrow %0aat one spell, and never stop to take breath in the middle. %0a%0a“ De Re Rust. c. 61. %0a%0aThese rules are borrowed mostly from Varro, B. i. c. 19, and Colu¬ %0amella, B. ii. c. 4. %0a%0a^ “ Vere actum “ worked in spring.” %0a%0a%0a64 %0a%0a%0aflint’s NAlTUKAL histoet. %0a%0a%0a[Book XVIII. %0a%0a%0aIt is a fair day’s work to plough one jugerum, for the first %0atime, nine inches in depth ; and the second time, one jugerum %0aand a half—that is to say, if it is an easy soil. If this, how¬ %0aever, is not the case, it will take a day to turn up half a juge¬ %0arum for the first time, and a whole jugerum the second; for %0aNature has set limits to the powers of animals even. The %0afurrows should be made, in every case, first in a straight line, %0aand then others should be drawn, crossing them obliquely,^ %0aUpon a hill-side the furrows are drawn transversely®* only, %0athe point of the share inclining upwards at one moment and %0adownwards®® at another. Man, too, is so well fitted for labour, %0athat he is able to supply the place of the ox even; at all events, %0ait is without the aid of that animal that the mountain tribes %0aplough, having only the hoe to help them.®^ %0a%0aThe ploughman, unless he stoops to his work, is sure to pre¬ %0avaricate,®* a word which has been transferred to the T'orum, as %0aa censure upon those who transgress—at any rate, let those be %0aon their guard against it, where it was first employed. The %0ashare should be cleaned every now and then with a stick pointed %0awith a scraper. The ridges that are left between every two %0afurrows, should not be left in a rough state, nor should large %0aclods be left protruding from the ground. A field is badly %0aploughed that stands in need of harrowing after the seed is in; %0abut the work has been properly done, when it is impossible to %0asay in which direction the share has gone. It is a good plan, %0atoo, to leave a channel every now and then, if the nature of the %0aspot requires it, by making furrows of a larger size, to draw off %0athe water into the drains. %0a%0a(20.) After the furrows have been gone over again transverse¬ %0aly, the clods are broken, where there is a necessity for it, with %0aeither the harrow or the rake;®^ and this operation is repeated %0a%0ass Virgil says the same, Georg, i. 9. %0a%0aCrosswise, or horizontally. %0a%0aZig-zag, apparently. %0a%0aA rude foreshadowing of the spade husbandry so highly spoken of %0aat the present day. %0a%0a62 n Prevaricare,” “ to make a balk,” as we call it, to make a tortuous %0afurrow, diverging from the straight line. %0a%0aHe probably means the heavy “ rastrum,” or rake, mentioned by %0aVirgil, Georg, i. 164.

This last harrowing is done, %0awhere the usage of the locality will allow of it, with either a %0atoothed harrow, or else a plank attached to the plough. This ope¬ %0aration of covering in the seed is called “lirare,” from which is %0aderived the word “ deliratio.”®^ Virgil,®* it is generally thought, %0aintends to recommend sowing after/owr ploughings, in the %0apassage where he says that land will bear the best crop, which %0ahas twice felt the sun and twice the cold. Where the soil is %0adense, as in most parts of Italy, it is a still better plan to go %0aover the ground five times before sowing; in Etruria, they give %0athe land as many as nine ploughings first. The bean, however, %0aand the vetch may be sown with no risk, without turning up %0athe land at all; which, of course, is so much labour saved. %0a%0aWe must not here omit to mention still one other method of %0aploughing, which the devastations of warfare have suggested , %0ain Italy that lies beyond the Padus. The Salassi,®® when %0aravaging the territories which lay at the foot of the Alps, made %0aan attempt to lay waste the crops of panic and miUet that were %0ajust appearing above the ground. Finding, however, that %0aNature resisted all their endeavours, they passed the plough %0aover the ground, the result of which was that the crops were %0amore abundant than ever ; and this it was that first taught us %0athe method of ploughing in, expressed by the word “ artrare,” %0aotherwise “ aratrare,” in my opinion the original form. This %0ais done either just as the stem begins to develope itself, or else %0awhen it has put forth as many as two or three leaves. Nor %0amust we withhold from the reader a more recent method, which %0awas discovered the year but one before this,®’ in the territory %0aof the Treviri. The crops having been nipped by the extreme %0aseverity of the winter, the people sowed the land over again %0ain the month of March, and had a most abundant harvest. %0a%0aWe shall now proceed to a description of the peculiar methods %0aemployed in cultivating each description of grain. %0a%0a“ A gong crookedhence its meaning of, folly, dotage, or madness. %0a%0a®* Georg, i. 47.

A single hand per jugerum will be quite enough for %0aany one of these kinds of grain. The operation of hoeing %0aloosens the ground in spring when it has been hardened and %0asaddened by the rigours of the winter, and admits the early %0asun to the interior. In hoeing, every care must he taken not %0ato go beneath the roots of the corn ; in the case of wheat, zea, %0aand barley, it is best to give a couple of hoeings. Stubbing,’® %0awhen the crop is just beginning to joint, cleanses it of all %0anoxious weeds, disengages the roots of the corn, and liberates %0athe growing blade from the clods. Among the leguminous %0aplants, the chick-pea requires the same treatment that spelt %0adoes. The bean requires no stubbing, being quite able of itself %0ato overpower all weeds; the lupine, too, is harrowed only. %0aMillet and panic are both harrowed and hoed; but this opera¬ %0ation is never repeated, and they do not require stubbing. %0aFenugreek and the kidney-bean require harrowing only. %0a%0aThere are some kinds of ground, the extreme fertility of %0awhich obliges the grower to comb down the crops while in the %0ablade—this is done with a sort of harrow” armed with pointed %0airon teeth—and even then he is obliged to depasture cattle upon %0athem. When, however, the blade has been thus eaten down, %0ait stands in need of hoeing to restore it to its former vigour. %0a%0aBut in Bactria, and at Cyrenae in Africa, all this trouble has %0abeen rendered quite unnecessary by the indulgent benignity of %0athe climate, and after the seed is in, the owner has no occasion %0ato return to the field till the time has come for getting in the %0aharvest. In those parts the natural dryness of the soil prevents %0anoxious weeds from springing up, and, aided by the night dews %0aalone, the soil supplies its nutriment to the grain. VirgU’* %0arecommends that the ground should be left to enjoy repose every %0aother year; and this, no doubt, if the extent of the farm will %0aadmit of it, is the most advantageous plan.

We ought to remark here more particularly, that here %0aand there certain plants are sown for the benefit of others, %0aalthough, as already stated in the preceding Book,’® not to %0arepeat the same thing over again, they are of little value them¬ %0aselves. But it is the nature of each soil that is of the greatest %0aimportance. %0a%0aCHAP. 51. (22.)— EXTREME FEETILITT OF SOIL. %0a%0aThere is a city of Africa, situate in the midst of the sands %0aas you journey towards the Syrtes and Great Leptis, Tacape’'* %0aby name. The soil there, which is always well-watered, en¬ %0ajoys a degree of fertility quite marvellous. Through this %0aspot, which extends about three miles each way, a spring of %0awater flows—in great abundance it is true—but still, it is only %0aat certain hours that its waters are distributed among the in¬ %0ahabitants. Here, beneath a palm of enormous size, grows the %0aolive, beneath the olive the fig, beneath the fig, again, the pome¬ %0agranate, beneath the pomegranate the vine, and beneath the %0avine we find sown, first wheat, then the leguminous plants, and %0aafter them garden herbs—all in the same year, and all growing %0abeneath another’s shade. Four cubits square of this same %0aground—the cubit’® being measured with the fingers contracted %0aand not extended—sell at the rate of four denarii.’® But what %0ais more surprising than all, is the fact that here the vine bears %0atwice, and that there are two vintages in the year. Indeed, %0aif the fertility of the soil were not distributed in this way %0aamong a multitude of productions, each crop would perish from %0aits own exuberance : as it is, there is no part of the year that %0athere is not some crop or other being gathered in; and yet, it %0ais a well-known fact, that the people do nothing at all to pro¬ %0amote this fruitfulness. %0a%0a’* In B. xvii. c. 7. %0a%0aSee B.

In the %0aprovince of Gallia Narbonensis there is a famous fountain, %0aOrge by name; within it there grow plants which are sought %0afor with such eagerness by the cattle, that they will plunge %0aover head into the Avater to get at them ; it is a well ascertained’’ %0afact, however, that these plants, though growing in the water, %0areceive their nutriment only from the rains that fall. It is %0aas well then that every one should be fully acquainted with the %0anature, not only of the soil, but of the water too. %0a%0aCHAP. 52. (23.) —THE METHOD OP SOWING MORE THAN ONCE %0aIN THE YEAR. %0a%0aIf the soil is of that nature which we have already’* spoken %0aof as “ tender,”’® after a crop of barley has been grown upon %0ait, millet may be sown, and after the millet has been got in, %0arape. In succession to these, again, barley may be put in, or %0aelse wheat, as in Campania ; and it will be quite enough, in %0asuch case, to plough the ground when the seed is sown. There %0ais another rotation again—when the ground has been cropped %0awith spelt,*® it should lie fallow the four winter months; after %0awhich, spring beans should be put in, to keep it occupied till %0athe time comes for cropping it with winter beans. Where the %0asoil is too rich, it may lie fallow one year, care being taken after %0asowing it with corn to crop it with the leguminous plants the %0athird year.®’ Where, on the other hand, it is too thin, the land %0ashould lie fallow up to the third year even. Some persons re¬ %0acommend that corn should never be sown except in land which %0ahas lain fallow the year before. %0a%0aCHAP. 53. -THE MANURING OF LAND. %0a%0aThe proper method of manuring is here a very important %0asubject for consideration—we have already treated of it at %0asome length in the preceding Book.*® The only point that is %0a%0a” How was this ascertained ?

Millet, panic, rape, and tur¬ %0anips should never be sown in any but a manured soil. If, on %0athe other hand, the land is not manured, sow wheat there in %0apreference to barley. The same, too, with fallow lands; %0athough in these it is generally recommended that beans should %0abe sown. It should be remembered, however, that wherever %0abeans are sown, the land should have been manured at as re¬ %0acent a period as possible. If it is intended to crop ground in %0aautumn, care must be taken to plough in manure in the month %0aof September, just after rain has fallen. In the same way, %0atoo, if it is intended to sow in spring, the manure should be %0aspread in the winter. It is the rule to give eighteen cart-loads %0aof manure to each jugerum, and to spread it well before %0aploughing it in,®^ or sowing the seed.®* If this manuring, %0ahowever, is omitted, it will be requisite to spread the land %0awith aviary dust just before hoeing is commenced. To clear %0aup any doubts with reference to this point, I would here ob¬ %0aserve that the fair price for a cart-load of manure is one %0adenarius; where, too, sheep furnish one cart-load, the larger %0acattle should furnish ten:®® unless this result is obtained, it %0ais a clear proof that the husbandman has littered his cattle %0abadly. %0a%0aThere are some persons who are of opinion that the best %0amethod of manuring land is to pen sheep there, with nets %0aerected to prevent them from straying. If land is not ma¬ %0anured, it will get chilled ; but if, on the other hand, it is over¬ %0amanured, it becomes burnt up : it is a much better plan, too, %0ato manure little and often than in excess. The wai’mer the %0asoil is by nature, the less manure it requires. %0a%0aCHAP. 54.

The grains of^ those ears which have %0aintervals between the seed should be rejected. The best gram %0ais that which has a reddish hue,®® and which, when broken %0abetween the teeth, presents the same®® colour that which has %0amore Avhite within is of inferior quality. It is a well-known %0afact that some lands require more seed than others, from which %0acircumstance first arose a superstition that exists among the %0apeasantry ; it is their belief that when the ground demands the %0aseed with greater avidity than usual, it is famished, and devours %0athe grain. It is consistent with reason to. put in the seed %0awhere the soil is humid sooner than elsewhere, to prevent the %0agrain from rotting in the rain : on dry spots it shoifid be sown %0alater, and just before the fall of a shower, so that it may not %0ahave to lie long without germinating and so come to nothing. %0aWhen the seed is put in early it should be sown thick, as it is %0aa considerable time before it germinates; but when it is put %0ain later, it should be sown thinly, to prevent it from being suf¬ %0afocated. There is a certain degree of skill, too, required in %0ascattering the seed evenly ; to ensure this, the hand must keep %0atime®® with the step, moving always with the right foot. %0aThere are certain persons, also, who have a secret method®’ of %0atheir own, having been born®'^ with a happy hand which im¬ %0aparts fruitfulness to the grain. Care should be taken not to %0asow seed in a warm locality which has been grown in a cold %0a%0a“ Sterile.” This is not necessarily the case, as we know with reference %0ato what is called mummy wheat, the seed of which has bocn recovered %0aat different times from the Egj'ptian tombs. %0a%0aThe threshing floor was made with an elevation in the middle, and %0athe sides on an incline, to the bottom of which the lai'gest grains would %0abe the most likely to fall. %0a%0a88 “Far” or spelt is of a red hue in the exterior. • %0a%0aThis appearance is uo longer to he observed, if, indeed, Pliny is cor¬ %0arect : all kinds of corn are white in the interior of the grain. %0a%0aHand-sowing is called by the French, “semer a la volee.” %0a%0aThis occult or mysterious method of which Pliny speaks, consists %0asolely of what we should call a “happy knack,” which some men have of %0asowing more evenly than others. %0a%0aSors genialis atque fecunda est. %0a%0a%0aChap. 55.] now MUCH GRAIN REQUISITE FOR A JUGERUM. /I %0a%0aone, nor should the produce of an early soil be sown in a late %0aone. Those who give advice to the contrary have quite mis¬ %0aapplied their pains. %0a%0aCHAP. 55. - WHAT QUANTITV OF EACH KIND OF GRAIN IS REQUISITE %0a%0aFOE SOWING A JUGERUM. %0a%0a®“In a soil of middling quality, the proper proportion of seed %0ais five modii of wheat or winter-wheat to the jugerum, ten of %0aspelt or of seed- wheat—that being the name which we have %0amentioned’^ as being given to one kind of wheat—six of %0abarley, one-fifth more of heans than of wheat, twelve of %0avetches, three of chick-pease, chicheling vetches, and pease, %0aten of lupines, three of lentils—(these last, however, it is said, %0amust he sown with dry manure)—six of fitches, six of fenu¬ %0agreek, four of kidney-beans, twenty of hay grass,®* and four %0asextarii of millet and panic. Where the soil is rich, the pro¬ %0aportion must be greater, where it is thin, less.®® %0a%0aThere is another distinction, too, to be made; where the %0asoil is dense, cretaceous, or moist, there should be six modii of %0awheat or winter-wheat to the jugerum, hut where the land is %0aloose, dry, and prolific, four will be enough. A meagre soil, %0atoo, if the crop is not very thinly sown, will produce a dimi¬ %0anutive, empty ear. Rich lands give a number of stalks to each %0agrain, and yield a thick crop from only a light sowing. The %0aresult, then, is, that from four to six modii must be sown, %0aaccording to the nature of the soil ; though there are some %0awho make it a rule that five modii is the proper proportion for %0asowing, neither more nor less, whether it is a densely-planted %0alocality, a declivitj', or a thin, meagre soil.

This is a question that depends in %0aa very great degree upon the stars; and I shall therefore make %0ait my first care to set forth all the opinions that have been %0awritten in reference to the subject. Hesiod, the first writer %0awho has given any precepts upon agriculture, speaks of one %0aperiod only for sowing—the setting of the Vergili® : but then %0ahe wrote in Boeotia, a country of Hellas, where, as we have %0aalready stated,^ they are still in the habit of sowing at that %0aperiod. %0a%0aIt is generally agreed by the most correct writers, that with %0a» the earth, as with the birds and quadrupeds, there are certain %0aimpulses for reproduction; and the epoch for this is fixed by %0athe Greeks at the time when the earth is warm and moist. %0aVirgiP says that wheat and spelt should be sown at the setting %0aof the Vergili®, barley between the autumnal equinox and %0athe winter solstice, and vetches,® kidney-beans, and lentils at %0athe setting of Bootes P it is of great importance, therefore, %0ato ascertain the exact days of the rising and setting of these %0aconstellations, as well as of the others. There are some, again, %0awho recommend the sowing to be done before the setting of %0athe Vergili®, hut only in a dry soil, and in those provinces %0awhere the weather is hot; for the seed, they say,® if put in the %0aground will keep, there being no moisture to spoil it, and %0awithin a single day after the next fall of rain, will make its %0aappearance above ground. Others, again, are of opinion that %0asowing should begin about seven days after the setting of the %0aVergili®, a period which is mostly followed by rain. Some %0athink that cold soils should be sown immediately after the %0aautumnal equinox, and a warm soil later, so that the blade %0amay not put forth too luxuriantly before winter. %0a%0aIt is universally agreed, however, that the sowing should %0a%0a1 In c. 8 of this Book. 2 Georg, i. 208. %0a%0a3 Georg, i. 227 4 See c. 74 of this Book. %0a%0a® Columella, B. ii. e. 8. %0a%0a%0aChap. 66.] THE PROPER TIMES FOR SOWING. %0a%0a%0a73 %0a%0a%0anot be done about the period of the winter solstice ; for this %0avery good reason—the winter seeds, if put in before the %0awinter solstice, will make their appearance above ground on %0athe seventh day, whereas, if they are sown just after it, they %0awill hardly appear by the fortieth. There are some, however, %0awho begin very earlj', and have a saying to justify their doing %0aso, to the effect that if seed sown too early often disappoints, %0aseed put in too late always does so. On the other hand, again, %0athere are some who maintain that it is better to sow in %0aspring than in a bad autumn ; and they say that if they find %0athemselves obliged to sow in spring, they would choose the %0aperiod that intervenes between the prevalence of the west %0awinds® and the vernal equinox. Some persons, however, take %0ano notice of the celestial phenomena, and only regulate their %0amovements by the months. In spring they put in flax, the %0aoat, and the poppy, up to the feast of the Quinquatria,’ as we %0afind done at the present day by the people of Italy beyond the %0aPadus. There, too, they sow beans and winter-wheat in the %0amonth of November, and spelt at the end of September, up %0ato the ides of October others, however, sow this last after %0athe ides of October, as late as the calends of November.® %0a%0aThe persons who do this take no notice, consequently, of the %0aphaenomena of Nature, while others, again, lay too much stress %0aupon them, and hence, by these refined subtleties and dis¬ %0atinctions, only add to their blindness; for here are ignorant %0arustics, not only dealing with a branch of learning, but that %0abranch astronomy ! It must stiU, however, be admitted that %0athe observation of the heavens plays a very important part in %0athe operations of agriculture ; and Virgil,^® we find, gives it as %0ahis advice, that before any thing else, we should learn the %0atheory of the winds, and the revolutions of the stars; for, as he %0asays, the agriculturist, no less than the mariner, should regu¬ %0alate his movements thereby. It is an arduous attempt, and %0aalmost beyond all hope of success, to make an endeavour to in¬ %0atroduce the divine science of the heavens to the uninformed %0a%0a* Favonius. See B. ii. c. 47. %0a%0a’ The five days’ festival in honour of Minerva. It begins on the four¬ %0ateenth before the calends of April, or on the nineteenth of March.

There are some astronomical %0adifficulties, however, which have been experienced by the %0alearned even, that ought to be first submitted for consideration, %0ain order that the mind may feel some encouragement on aban¬ %0adoning the study of the heavens, and may be acquainted with %0afacts at least, even though it is still unable to see into fu¬ %0aturity. %0a%0aCHAP. 57. (25.) -AKKANGEMENT OF THE STAES ACCOEDING TO TEE %0a%0aTEllKESTBIAL DAYS AND NIGHTS. %0a%0aIn the first place, it is almost an utter impossibility to cal¬ %0aculate with a fair degree of accuracj'^ the days of the jmar and %0athe movements of the sun. To the three hundred and sixty- %0afive days there are still to be added the intercalary days, the %0aresult of the additional quarters of a day and night: hence it %0ais, that it is found impossible to ascertain Avith exactness the %0aproper periods for the appearance of the stars. To this we %0amust add, too, a certain degree of uncertainty connected with %0athese matters, that is universally admitted; thus, for instance, %0abad and wintry weather will often precede, b)" sev'eral days, %0athe proper period for the advent of that season, a state of things %0aknown to the Greeks as while at another time, %0a%0ait will last longer than usual, a state of circumstances known as %0aThe effects, too, of the changes that take place %0ain the seasons will sometimes be felt later, and at other times %0aearlier, upon their reaching the face of the earth ; and we not %0aunfrequently hear the remark made, upon the return of fine %0aweather, that the action of such and such a constellation is %0anow completed.'^ And then, again, as all these phcenomena de¬ %0apend upon certain stars, arranged and regulated in the vault of %0aheaven, Ave find intervening, in accordance with the movements %0aof certain stars, hailstorms and showers, themselves productive %0aof no slight results, as we have already observed,^'* and apt to %0ainterfere with the anticipated regular recurrence of the seasons. %0a!Nor are we to suppose that these disappointments fall upon the %0ahuman race only, for other animated beings, as well as ourseh'es, %0a%0a“ “ To be an early winter.” “ To be a long winter.” %0a%0a13 Confectum sidus. n In B. xvii. c. 2. %0a%0a%0aChap. 57.] %0a%0a%0aAUKAKGfiilEXr OF THE STARS. %0a%0a%0a75 %0a%0a%0aare deceived in regard to them, although endowed with even a %0agreater degree of sagacity upon these points than we are, from %0athe fact of their very existence depending so materially upon %0athem. Hence it is, that we sometimes see the summer birds %0akilled by too late or too early cold, and the winter birds by %0aheat coming out of the usual season. It is for this reason, %0athat Virgilhas recommended us to study the courses of the %0aplanets, and has particularly warned us to watch the passage %0aof the cold star Saturn. %0a%0aThere are some who look upon the appearance of the butter¬ %0afly as the surest sign of spring, because of the extreme delicacy %0aof that insect. In this present j^ear,^® however, in which I %0aam penning these lines, it has been remarked that the flights %0aof butterflies have been killed three several times, by as many %0areturns of the cold ; while the foreign birds, which brought %0aus by the sixth of the calends of February ” every indication %0aof an early spring, after that had to struggle against a winter %0aof the greatest severity. In treating of these matters, we have %0ato meet a twofold difficulty: first of all, we have to ascertain %0awhether or not the celestial phaenomena are regulated by %0acertain laws, and then we have to seek how to reconcile those %0alaws with apparent facts. We must, however, be more par¬ %0aticularly careful to take into account the convexity of the earth, %0aand the differences of situation in the localities upon the face %0aof the globe; for hence it is, that the same constellation shows %0aitself to different nations at different times, the result being, %0athat its influence is by no means perceptible everywhere at the %0asame moment. This difficulty has been considerably enhanced, %0atoo, by various authors, who, after making their observations %0ain different localities, and indeed, in some instances, in the same %0alocality, have yet given us varying or contradictory results. %0a%0aThere have been three great schools of astronomy, the Chal- %0adaean, the ^Egyptian, and the Grecian. To these has been %0aadded a fourth school, which was established by the. Dictator %0aCaesar among ourselves, and to which was entrusted the duty %0aof regulating the year in conformity with the sun’s revolution,** %0aunder the auspices of Sosigenes, an astronomer of considerable %0alearning and skill. His theory, too, upon the discovery of cer¬ %0atain errors, has since been corrected, no intercalations having %0a%0a** Georg L 335. >6 a.u.c. 830. %0a%0a** Twehly-seveuth of January. is gojig cursum.. %0a%0a%0a76 %0a%0a%0aflint’s natueal history. %0a%0a%0a[Book XVIIT. %0a%0a%0abeen made for twelvesuccessive years, upon its being found %0athat the year which before had anticipated the constellations, %0awas now beginning to fall behind them. Even Sosigenes him¬ %0aself, too, though more correct than his predecessors, has not %0ahesitated to show, by his continual corrections in the three %0aseveral treatises which he composed, that he still entertained %0agreat doubts on the subject. The writers, too, whose names are %0ainserted at the beginning of this work,*® have sufficiently re¬ %0avealed the fact of these discrepancies, the opinions of one being %0ararely found to agree with those of another. This, however, %0ais less surprising in the case of those whose plea is the difference %0aof the localities in which they wTote. But with reference to %0athose who, though living in the same country, have still arrived %0aat different results, we shall here mention one remarkable %0ainstance of discrepancy. Hesiod—for under his name, also, %0awe have a treatise extant on the Science of the Stars *‘—has %0astated that the morning setting of the Vergiliae takes place at %0athe moment of the autumnal equinox; whereas Thales, we %0afind, makes it the twenty-fifth day after the equinox, Anaxi¬ %0amander the twenty-ninth, and Euctemon the forty-eighth. %0a%0aAs for ourselves, we shall follow the balculations made b}'^ %0aJulius Caesar,** which bear reference more particularly to Italy; %0athough at the same time, we shall set forth the dicta of various %0aother writers, bearing in mind that we are treating not of an %0aindividual country, but of Nature considered in her totality. %0aIn doing this, however, we shall name, not the writers them¬ %0aselves, for that would be too lengthy a task, but the countries %0ain reference to 'wffiich they speak. The reader must bear in %0amind, then, that for the sake of saving space, under the head %0aof Attica, we include the islands of the Cyclades as well; under %0athat of Macedonia, Magnesia and Thracia; under that of Egypt, %0a%0aSoon after the corrections made by order of Julius Csesar, the Pon- %0atifices mistook the proper method of intercalation, by making it every %0athird year instead of the fourth; the consequence of which was, that %0aAugustus was obliged to correct the results of their error by omitting the %0aintercalary day for twelve years. %0a%0aHe most probably refers to the list of writers originally appended to %0athe First Book; but which in the present Translation is distributed at the %0acud of each Book.

Chaldaca, when mentioned, will signify Assyria and Baby¬ %0alonia, as well. %0a%0a!My silence as to Africa,*^ Spain, and the provinces of Gaul, %0awill occasion no surprise, from the fact that no one has pub¬ %0alished any observations made upon the stars in those countries. %0aStill, however, there will be no difficulty in calculating them, %0aeven for these regions as well, on reference being made to the %0aparallels which have been set forth in the Sixth Book.“ By %0aadopting this course, an accurate acquaintance may be made %0awith the astronomical relations, not only of individual nations, %0abut of cities even as well. By taking the circular parallels %0awhich we have there appended to the several portions of the %0aearth respective!)’-, and applying them to the countries in ques¬ %0ation, that are similarly situate, it will be foimd that the rising %0aof the heavenly bodies will be the same for all parts -within %0athose parallels, where the shadows projected are of equal length. %0aIt is also deserving of remark, that the seasons have their %0aperiodical recurrences, without any marked difference, ever)* %0afour years, in consequence of the influence “ of the sun, and that %0athe characteristics of the seasons are developed in excess every %0aeighth year, at the revolution of every hundredth moon. %0a%0aCHAP. 58. —THE RISING AND SETTING OF THE STABS. %0a%0aThe whole of this system is based upon the observation of %0athree branches of the heavenly phsenomena, the rising of the %0aconstellations, their setting, and the regular recurrence of the %0aseasons. These risings and settings may be observed in two %0adifferent ways :—The stars are either concealed, and cease to %0abe seen at the rising of the sun, or else present themselves to %0aour view at his setting —this last being more generally known %0aby the name of “ emersion ” than of “ rising,” while their dis- %0a%0a“ J. e.

In addition to this, there are certain stars %0awhich rise and set twice.^ All that we here state beai’s refer¬ %0aence, it must be remembered, to the fixed stars only. %0a%0aCHAP. 59. -THE EPOCHS OP THE SEASONS. %0a%0aThe year is divided into four periods or seasons, the recurrence %0aof which is indicated by the increase or diminution of the %0adaylight. Immediately after the winter solstice the days begin %0ato increase, and by the time of the vernal equinox, or in other %0awords, in ninety days and three hours, the day is equal in %0alength to the night. After this, for ninety-four days and %0atwelve hours, the days continue to increase, and the nights to %0adiminish in proportion, up to the summer solstice ; and from %0athat point the days, though gradually decreasing, are still in %0aexcess of the nights for ninety-two days, twelve hours, until the %0aautumnal equinox. At this period the days are of equal %0alength with the nights, and after it they continue to decrease %0ainversely to the nights until the winter solstice, a period %0aof eighty-eight days and three hours. In all these calcu¬ %0alations, it must be remembered, equinoctiaP® hours are spoken %0aof, and not those measured arbitrarily in reference to the %0alength of any one day in particular. All these seasons, too, %0acommence at the eighth degree of the signs of the Zodiac. %0aThe winter solstice begins at the eighth degree of Capricorn, %0athe eighth'*® day before the calends of January, in generalthe %0avernal equinox at the eighth degree of Aries; the summer %0asolstice, at the eighth degree of Cancer; and the autumnal %0aequinox at the eighth degree of Libra: and it is rarely that %0a%0aSee c. 69, as to Arcturus and Aquila. %0a%0aHe speaks of Equinoctial hours, these being in all cases of the same %0alength, in contradistinction to the Temporal, or Unequal hours, whicti %0awith the Romans were a twelfth part of the Natural day, from sunrise to %0asunset, and of course were continually varying. %0a%0aTsventy-fifth of December. so Fere. %0a%0a%0aChap. 60.j THE PUOPEE TIME FOU WINTEE SOWING. 79 %0a%0athese days do not respectively give some indication of a change %0ain the weather. %0a%0aThese four seasons again, are subdivided, each of them, into %0atwo equal parts. Thus, for instance, between the summer %0asolstice and the autumnal equinox, the setting of the Lyre,^* %0aon the forty-sixth day, indicates the beginning of autumn; be¬ %0atween the autumnal equinox and the winter solstice, the morn¬ %0aing setting of the Vergilim, on the forty-fourth day, denotes %0athe beginning of winter; between the winter solstice and the %0avernal equinox, the prevalence of the west winds on the forty- %0afifth day, denotes tlie commencement of spring ; and between %0athe vernal equinox and the summer solstice, the morning rising %0aof the Vergili®, on the forty-eighth day, announces the com¬ %0amencement of summer. We shall here make seed-time, or in %0aother words, the morning setting of the Vergili®, our starting- %0apoint and shall not interrupt the thread of our explanation %0aby making any mention of the minor constellations, as such a %0acourse would only augment the difficulties that already exist. %0aIt is much about this period that the stormy constellation of %0aOrion departs, after traversing a large portion of the heavens.-^'* %0a%0aCHAP. 60. —THE PROPER TIME FOR WINTER SOWING. %0a%0aMost persons anticipate the proper time for sowing, and be¬ %0agin to put in the corn immediately after the eleventh day of %0athe autumnal equinox, at the rising of the Crown, when we %0amay reckon, almost to a certainty, upon several days of rainy %0aweather in succession. Xenophon^ is of opinion, that sowing %0ashould not be commenced until the Deity has given us the %0asignal for it, a term by which Cicero understands the rains that %0aprevail in November. The true method to be adopted, how¬ %0aever, is not to sow until the leaves begin to fall. Some per¬ %0asons are of opinion that this takes place at the setting of the %0a%0aIn this Translation, the names of the Constellations are given in %0aEnglish, except in the case of the signs of the Zodiac, which are univer¬ %0asally known by their Latin appellations. %0a%0a*- He begins in c. 64, at the winter solstice, and omits the period be¬ %0atween the eleventh of November and the winter solstice altogether, so far %0aas the mention of individual days. %0a%0a“ Cum sidus vehemens Orionis iisdcm diebus longo decedat spatio.” %0aThis passage is apparently unintelligible, if considered, as Sillig reads %0ait, as dependent on the preceding one. %0a%0aIn his (Ecouomica. %0a%0a%0a80 %0a%0a%0aflint’s natural HT8TOET. %0a%0a%0a[Book XVIII. %0a%0a%0aVergilise, or the third day before the ides of November, as %0aalready stated,^® and they carefully observe it, for it is a con¬ %0astellation very easily remarked in the heavens, and warns us %0ato resume our winter clothes.®® Hence it is, that immediately %0aon its setting, the approach of winter is expected, and care is %0ataken by those who are on their guard against the exorbitant %0acharges of the shop-keepers, to provide themselves with an %0aappropriate dress. If the Vergiliae set with cloudy weather, %0ait forebodes a rainy winter, and the prices of cloaks®’ imme¬ %0adiately rise; but if, on the other hand, the weather is clear at %0athat period, a sharp winter is to be expected, and then the %0aprice of garments of other descriptions is sure to go up. But %0aas to the husbandman, unacquainted as he is with the phae- %0anomena of the heavens, his brambles are to him in place of %0aconstellations, and if he looks at the ground he sees it covered %0awdth their leaves. This fall of the leaves, earlier in one place %0aand later in another, is a sure criterion of the temperature of %0athe weather; for there is a great affinity between the effects %0aproduced by the weather in this respect, and the nature of the %0asoil and climate. There is this peculiar advantage, too, in the %0acareful observation of these effects, that they are sure to be %0aperceptible throughout the whole earth, while at the same time %0athey have certain features which are peculiar to each individual %0alocality.—A person may perhaps be surprised at this, who does %0anot bear in mind that the herb pennyroyal,®® which is hung up %0ain our larders, always blossoms on the day of the winter sol¬ %0astice ; so firmly resolved is Nature that nothing shall remain %0aconcealed from us, and in that spirit has given us the fall of %0athe leaf as the signal for sowing. %0a%0aSuch is the true method of interpreting all these phsenomena, %0agranted to us by Nature as a manifestation of her wiU. It %0ais in this way that she warns us to prepare the ground, makes %0aus a promise of a manure, as it were, in the fail of the leaves, %0aannounces to us that the earth and the productions thereof are %0athus protected by her against the cold, and warns us to hasten %0athe operations of agriculture. %0a%0aIn B. ii. c. 47. %0a%0a“ Vestis institor est.” This passage is probably imperfect. %0a%0a“Lacernarum.” ’^“Puleium.” See B. ii. c. 41 . %0a%0a%0aChap. 62.] %0a%0a%0aWOKK Fon FACU MONTH, %0a%0a%0a81 %0a%0a%0aCHAP. 61.- wnF.N lO sow the xegusitnocs plants and the %0a%0aPOPPi'. %0a%0aVarro^® has given no other sign but this^® for our guidance %0ain sowing the bean.

Some sa}', however, that %0ait wanted for fodder, they may be sown at these periods, but %0aif for seed, in the spring. There is another sign, more evident %0astill, supplied us b)" the marvellous foresight of I^ature, w'ith %0areference to which we will give the words employed by Cicero %0ahimself: %0a%0a“ The lentisk, ever green and ever oent %0abeneath its fruits, affords a tltreofold crop: %0a%0aThrice teeming, tlirice it warns us when to plough.” %0a%0aOne of the periods here alluded to, is the same that is now %0aunder consideration, being the appropriate time also for sowing %0aflax and the poppy.'*® With reference to this last, Cato gives the %0afollowing ad vice : ‘‘Burn, upon land where corn has been grown, %0athe twigs and branches wdiich are of no use to you, and. when %0athat is done, sow the poppy there.” The wild’ poppy, which %0ais of an utilit)' that is quite marvellous, is boiled in honey as a %0aremedy for diseases in the throat,"® while the cultivated kind is %0aa powerful narcotic.

Caesar has observ'ed, %0athat the same takes place on the third®* before the nones of %0aMarch, at the rising of Cancer; and most authorities say the same %0aAvith reference to ihe emersion of the Vintager.®® On the eighth®* %0abefore the ides of March, the northern limb of Pisces®’ rises, %0aand on the next day Orion, at which period also, in Attica, the %0aKite is first seen. Ciesar has noted, too, the setting of Scorpio %0aon the ides of March,®® a day that was so fatal to him; and on %0athe fifteenth*® before the calends of April, the Kite appears in %0aItaly. On the twelfth’® before the calends of April, the Horse %0asets in the morning. %0a%0aThis interval of time is a period of extreme activity for the %0aagriculturist, and affords him a great number of occupations, %0ain reference to which, howeA^er, he is extremely liable to be de¬ %0aceived. He is summoned to the commencement of these %0alabours, not upon the day on which the west winds ought to %0abegin, but upon the day on which they really do begin, to blow. %0aThis moment then must be looked for with the most careful %0aattention, as it is a signal Avhich the Deity has vouchsafed us %0ain this month, attended with no doubts or equivocations, if %0aonly looked for with scrupulous care. We have.already stated %0ain the Second Book,” the quarter in which this wind blows, %0aand the exact point from Avhich it comes, and before long we %0ashall have occasion to speak of it again still more in detail. %0a%0aIn the mean time, however, setting out from the day, what- %0a%0a** Sixteenth of February.

Three %0amonth wheat must now be sown, the vine pruned in the wa)* %0awe have already’* described, the olive carefully attended to, %0afruit-trees put in and grafted, vineyards cleaned and hoed, %0aseedlings laid out, and replaced in the nursery by others, the %0areed, the willow, and the broom planted and lopped, and the %0aelm, the poplar, and the plane planted in manner alread)'men¬ %0ationed. At this period, also, the crops of corn ought to be %0aweeded,and the winter kinds, spelt more particular!}', well %0ahoed. In doing this, there is a certain rule to be observed, the %0aproper moment being when four blades have made their appear¬ %0aance, and with the bean this should never be done until three %0aleaves have appeared above ground ; even then, however, it is a %0abelter plan to clean them only with a slight hoeing, in preference %0ato digging up the ground—but in no case should they ever be %0atouched the first fifteen days of their blossom. Harley must %0anever be hoed except when it is quite dry : take care, too, to %0ahave all the pruning doughy the vernal equinox. Four men %0awill be suflScient for pruning a jugerum of ^vineyard, and each %0ahand will be able to train fifteen vines to their trees.’® %0a%0aAt this period, too, attention should be paid to the gardens %0aand rose-beds, subjects which will be separately treated of in %0asucceeding Books; due care should be given to ornamental %0agardening as well. It is now, loo, the very best time for %0amaking ditches. The ground should now be opened for future %0apurposes, as we find recommended by Yirgil’® in particular, %0ain order that the sun may thoroughly warm the clods. It is a %0apiece of even more sound advice, which recommends us to %0a})lough no lands in the middle of spring but those of mid¬ %0adling quality ; for if this is done with a rich soil, weeds will be %0asure to spring up in the furrows immediately; and if, on the %0a%0aSeventh of February.

It is a much %0abetter plan, beyond a doubt, to plough such soils as these in %0aautumn. %0a%0aCato’’lays down the following rules for the operations or %0aspring. “Ditches,” he saj's, “should be dug in the seed- %0ajilots, vines should be grafted, and the elm, tlie fig, the olive, %0aaud other fruit-trees planted in dense and humid soils. Such %0ameadows’® as are not irrigated, must be manured in a dry %0amoon, jirotected from the western blasts, and carefully cleaned ; %0anoxious weeds must be rooted up, fig-trees cleared, new seed-' %0ajilots made, and the old ones dressed : all this should be done %0abefore you begin to hoe the vineyard. When the pear is in %0ablossom, too, you should begin to plough, Avhere it is a meagre, %0agravelly soil. When you have done all this, you may plough %0athe more heavy, watery soils, doing this the last of all.” %0a%0aThe proper time for ploughing, then,” is denoted by these %0atwo signs, the earliest fruit of the lentisk ®® making its appear¬ %0aance, aud the blossoming of the pear. There is a third sign, %0aliowever, as well, the flowering of the squill among the bul- %0ahous,®‘ and of the narcissus among the garland, plants. For %0a. both the squill and the narcissus, as well as the lentisk, flower %0athree times, denoting by their first flowering the first period %0afor ploughing, by the second flowering the second, and by the %0athird flowering the last; in this Avay it is that one thing affords %0ahints for another. There is one precaution, too, that is by no %0ameans the least important among them all, not to let ivj’ touch %0athe bean while in blossom; for at this period the ivy is noxious®' %0ato it, and most baneful in its effects. Some plants, again, %0aafford certain signs which bear reference more particularly to %0athemselves, the fig for instance ; Avhen a few leaves only are %0afound shooting from the summit, like a cup in shape, then it is %0amore particularly that the fig-tree should be planted. %0a%0aCHAP. 66.—AVORK TO BE DONE AFTER THE VERNAL EQUINOX. %0a%0aThe vernal equinox appears to end on the eighth day be- %0a%0a“ he Re Rust. 40.

This constellation has ordinarilj- the %0aname of Parilicium, from the circumstance that the eleventh ®® %0abefore the calends of Maj’ is observed as the natal day of the %0aCity of Rome; upon this day, too, fine weather generally re¬ %0aturns, and gives us a clear sky for our observations.

The latter part of this period is the proper %0atime for sowing panic and millet; the precise moment, how¬ %0aever, is just after the barley has ripened. In the case of the %0avery same land, too, there is one sign that points in common %0aboth to the ripening of the barley and the sowing of panic and %0amillet—the appearance of the glow-worm, shining in the fields %0aat night. “ Cicindelae is the name given by the country %0apeople to these flying stars, while the Greeks call them “ 1am- %0apyrides,”—another manifestation of .the incredible bounteous¬ %0aness of Nature. %0a%0aCHAP. 67.

The She-goat sets in %0athe evening of the twelfth before'* the calends of June, and %0ain Attica the Dog.

Sheep, too, are %0asheared at this period, lupines turned up for manuring the %0aland, the ground dug, vetches cut for fodder, and beans gathered %0ain and threshed. %0a%0a(28.) About the calends of June*® the meadows are mown ; %0athe cultivation of which, the one which is the easiest of all, %0aand requires the smallest outlay, leads me to enter into some %0afurther details relative to it. Meadow lands should be selected %0a%0a%0ain a rich, or else a moist or ivell-watered, soil, and care should %0abe taken to drain the rain-water upon them from the high¬ %0aroad. The best method of ensuring a good crop of grass, is %0afirst to plough the land, and then to harrow it: but, before %0apassing the harrow over it, the ground should be sprinkled %0awith such seed as may have fallen from the ha}' in the hay¬ %0alofts and mangers.

Care, too, %0ashould be taken, ever)' time the grass is cut, to pass the sickle %0aover the ground, and so cut the aftermath which the mowers %0ahave left behind ; for it is a very bad plan to leave any of the %0agrass and let it shed its seed there. The best crop for meadow %0aland is trefoil,^" and the next best is grass nuramulus-^ is %0athe very worst of all, as it bears a pod which is particularly %0ainjurious; equisaetis,^“ too, which derives its name from its %0aresemblance to horse-hair, is of a noxions character. The pro- %0aj)er time for mowing grass is when the ear begins to shed its %0ablossom and to grow strong: care must be taken to cut it %0abefore it becomes dry and parched. “Don’t mow your hay %0atoo late,” says Cato “but cut it before the seed is ripe.” %0aSome persons turn the water upon it the day before mowing, %0awhere it is practicable to do so. It is the best plan to cut hay %0ain the night while the dews are falling.^’ In some parts of %0aItaly the mowing is not done till after harvest. %0a%0aThis operation, too, was a very expensive one in ancient %0atimes. In those days the onlj'’ whetstones"® known were %0athose of Crete and other places beyond sea, and they only used %0aoil to sharpen the scythe with. For this purpose the mower %0amoved along, with a horn, to hold the oil, fastened to his %0athigh. Italy has since furnished us with whetstones which are %0aused with water, and give an edge to the iron quite equal to %0athat imparted by the file; these water-whetstones, however, %0aturn green very quickly. Of the scythe^® there are two va- %0a%0aTlie varieties now known as Trifolium pratense, Trifoliuni rubens %0aand Trifolium repens. %0a%0a“ Gramen.” Under this head, as Fee says, he probably includes the %0agramineous plants, known as Alopccurus, Phleum, Poa, Festuna, &o. %0a%0aProbably the Lysimaebia nummularia of Linnaeus, which has a ten¬ %0adency to corrode the lips of the sheep that pasture on it. %0a%0aKnown to us as “horse-tail;” varieties of which are the Equisetum %0afluviatile and the Equisetum palustre of Linnaeus. %0a%0aDe Re Rust. c. 53.

The Italian mowers %0acut with one hand onl}'. It is a fair day’s work for one man %0ato cut a jugerum of grass, and for another to bind twelve hun¬ %0adred sheaves of four pounds each. When the grass is cut it %0ashould be turned towards the sun, and must never be stacked %0auntil it is quite dry. If this last precaution is not carefully %0ataken, a kind of vapour will be seen arising from the rick in %0athe morning, and as soon as the sun is up it will ignite to a %0acertaint}'^, and so be consumed. When the grass has been cut, %0athe meadow must be irrigated again, for the purpose of ensur¬ %0aing a crop in the autumn, known to us as the “cordum,” or %0aaftermath. At Interamna in Umbria the grass is cut four %0atimes** a-year, and this although the meadows there are not %0airrigated,—in most places, three. After all this has been done, %0atoo, the pasturage of the land is found no less lucrative than %0athe hay it has produced. This, however, is a matter of con¬ %0asideration for those more particularly who rear large herds of %0acattle, and every one whose occupation it is tp breed beasts of %0aburden, will have his own opinions upon the subject: it is %0afound, however, the most lucrative of all by those whose busi¬ %0aness it is to train chariot-horses. %0a%0aCHAP. 68.—THE SUMMER SOLSTICE. %0a%0aWe have already stated** that the summer solstice arrives at %0athe eighth degree of Cancer, and upon the eighth day before** %0athe calends of July : this is an important crisis in the year, %0aand of great interest to the Avhole earth.

And it is not the leaves of trees only that are %0awild and far remote that do this, nor have those persons who %0aare on the look-out for these signs to go into devious forests %0aand mountain tracts to seek them. Nor yet, on the other %0ahand, are they to be seen in the leaves of trees only that are %0agrown in the vicinity of cities or reared by the hand of the %0aornamental gardener, although in them they are to be seen %0aas well. Nature upon this occasion turns the leaf of the %0aolive which meets us at every step; she turns the leaf of %0athe linden, sought by us, as it is, for a thousand purposes ; %0ashe turns the leaf of the white poplar, too, wedded to the vine %0athat grows upon its trunk. And still, for her, all this is not %0aenough. " You have the elm,” she says, “reared for the sup¬ %0aport of the vine, and the leaf of that I will make to turn as %0aAvell. The leaves of this tree you have to gather for fodder, the %0aleaves of the vine you prune away.

Upon the %0amorning of the same day, also, the scorching constellation of %0aProcyon rises. This last constellation has no name with the %0aRomans, unless, indeed, we would consider it as identical with %0aCanicula,®® or Lesser Dog, which we tiud depicted among %0athe stars ; this last is productive of excessive heat, as we shall %0ashortly have further occasion to state. On the fourth^®^beforo %0athe nones of July, the Crown sets in the morning to the people %0aof Chaldtea, and in Attica, the w'hole of Orion has risen by %0athat day. On the day beforethe ides of July, the rising ot %0aOrion ends to the Egyptians also; on the sixteenth before %0athe calends of August, Procyon rises to the people of Assyria, %0aand, the day but one after, of nearly all other countries as well, %0aindicating a crisis that is universally known among all nations, %0aand which by us is called the rising of the Dog-star ; the sun %0aat this period entering the first degree of Leo. The Dog-star %0arises on the twenty-third day after the summer solstice; the %0ainfluence of it is felt by both ocean, and earth, and even by many %0aof the animals as well, as stated by us elsewhere on the appro¬ %0apriate occasions.^® No less veneration, in fact, is paid to this %0astar, than to those that ai'e consecrated to certain gods; it %0aLindles the flames of the sun, and is one great source of the %0aheats of summer. %0a%0aOn the thirteenth day before the calends of August, the %0aEagle sets in the morning to the people of Egypt, and tlie %0abreezes that are the precursors of the Etesian winds, begin to %0ablow; these, according to Caesar, are fii’st perceived in Italy, %0aon the tenth before the calends of August.

On %0atlie eighth beforetlie ides of August, one half of Arcturus %0ahas ceased to be visible, and on the third before*® the ides tlie %0aLyre, by its setting, opens the autumn,—according to Caesar at %0aleast ; though a more exact calculation has since shown, that %0athis takes place on the sixth day before the ides of that month. %0a%0aThe time that intervenes between these periods is one that %0ais of primary importance in the cultivation of the vine; as %0athe constellation of which we have spoken, under the name of %0aCanicula, has now to decide upon the fate of tlie grape. Jt is %0aat this period that the grapes are said to be charred,®'’ a blight %0afalling upon them which burns them away, as though red-hot %0acoals had been applied to them. There is no hail that can be %0acompared with this destructive malady, nor yet any of those %0atempests, wliich have been productive of such scarcity and %0adearth. For the evil effects of these, at the very utmost, are %0aonly felt in isolated districts, while the coal blight,®’ on the other %0ahand, extends over whole countries, far and wide. Still, how¬ %0aever, the remedy would not be very difficult, were it not that %0amen would mucli rather calumniate Nature, than help them¬ %0aselves.

At a %0amore recent period, again, Sextius,'” a Homan philosopher re¬ %0asiding at Athens, made a similar application of his knowledge. %0aSuch, then, is the utility of science, the instruction provided %0aby which it shall be my aim, as clearly and as perspicuously %0aos possible, to apply to the various occupations ot a country %0alife. %0a%0aMost writers have said that it is the dew, scorched by a %0aburning sun, that is the cause of mildew ** in corn, and of coal- %0ablight in the vine; this, however, seems to me in a great %0ameasure incorrect, and it is my opinion that all blights result %0aentirely from cold, and that the sun is productive of no injurious %0aeffects whatever. This, in fact, will be quite evident, if only a %0alittle attention is paid to the subject; for we find that the blight %0amakes its apj)earance at first in the night time only, and before %0athe sun has shone with any vigour. The natural inference is, %0athat it depends entirely upon the moon, and more particularly %0aas such a calamity as this is never known %3c:o happen except at the %0amoon’s conjunction, or else at the full moon, periods at which %0athe influence of that heavenly bod)' is at its greatest height. %0aFor at both of these periods, as already*® stated by us more %0athan once, the moon is in reality at the full; though during %0aher conjunction she throws back to the heavens all the light %0aw'hich she has received from the sun. The difference in the %0aeffects produced by the moon at these two periods is very great, %0athough at the same time equally apparent; for at the conjunc¬ %0ation, that body is extremely hot in summer, but cold in win¬ %0ater; while, on the other hand, at the full moon, the nights are %0acold in summer, but warm in winter. The reason of thi.'i, %0aalthough Fabianus and the Greek writers adopt another me¬ %0athod of explaining it, is quite evident. During the moon’s %0aconjunction in summer, she must of necessity move along with %0athe sun in an orbit nearer to the earth, and so become warmed %0a%0aMentioned by Seneca, Ep. 59. %0a%0a** It was reserved for the latter part of the last century to discover that %0a7'iildew operated on vegetation through the medium of minute, parasitical %0afungi. It is mostly attributed to defects in the light or the atmosphere, %0aor else humidity in excess.

In winter, again, at the time of the conjunction, %0ashe is farther off from us, the sun being also removed to a %0agreater distance. On the other hand, again, when the moon %0ais at the full in summer, she is more remote from the earth, %0aand in opposition with the sun; while, in winter, she ap¬ %0aproaches nearer to us at that period, by adopting the same %0aorbit as at her conjunction in summer. Naturally humid her¬ %0aself, as often as from her position she is cold, she congeals to %0aan unlimited extent the dews which fall at that period of the %0ayear. %0a%0aCHAP. 69.— CAUSES OF STKUILITT. %0a%0aBut we ought always to bear in mind, more particularly, %0athat there are two varieties of evils that are inflicted upon the %0aearth by the heavens. The first of these, known by us under %0athe name of “ tempests,” comprehends hail-storms, hurricanes %0aand other calamities of a similar nature ; when these take place %0aat the full moon, they come upon us with additional intensity. %0aThese tempests take their rise in certain noxious constellations, %0aas already stated by us on several occasions, Arcturus, for in¬ %0astance, Orion, and the Kids. %0a%0aThe other evils that are thus inflict(!d upon us, supervene with %0aa bright, clear sky, and amid the silence of tlie night, no one %0abeing sensible of them until we have perceived their effects. %0aThese dispensations are universal and of a totally different %0acharacter from those previously mentioned, and have various %0anames given to them, sometimes mildew, sometimes blast, and %0asometimes coal blight; but in all cases stei’ility is the infallible %0aresult. It is of these last that we have now to speak, entering %0ainto details which have not hitherto been treated of by any %0awriter; and first of all we will explain the causes of them. %0a%0a(29.) Independently of the moon, there are two principal %0acauses of these calamities, which emanate more particularly %0afrom two quarters of the heavens of but limited extent. On %0athe one hand, the Vergiliae exercise an especial influence on our %0aharvests, as it is with their rising that the summer begins, and %0awith their setting, the winter; thus embracing, in the space of %0asix months, the harvest, the vintage, and the ripening of all the %0avegetable productions. In addition to this, there is a circular %0atract in the heavens, quite visible to the human eye even, known %0a%0aVOL. IV. H %0a%0a%0a98 %0a%0a%0aflint’s natural history. %0a%0a%0a[Rook XVriT. %0a%0a%0aas the Milky "Way. It is the emanations from this, flowing as %0ait were from the breast, that supply their milky®^ nutriment to %0aall branches of the vegetable world. Two constellations more %0aparticularly mark this circular tract, the Eagle in the north, %0aand Canicula in the south ; of this last, we have already made %0amention in its appropriate place. This circle traverses also %0aSagittarius and Gemini, and passing through the centre of the %0asun, cuts the equinoctial line below, the constellation of the %0aEagle making its appearance at the point of intersection on %0athe one side, and Canicula on the other. Hence it is that the %0ainfluences of both these constellations develope themselves %0aupon all cultivated lands ; it being at these points only that the %0acentre of the sun is brought to correspond with that of the %0aearth. If, then, at the moments of the rising and the setting %0aof these constellations, the air, soft and pure, transmits these %0agenial and milky emanations to the earth, the crops will thrive %0aand ripen apace; but if, on the other hand, the moon, as al¬ %0aready®® mentioned, sheds her chilling dews, the bitterness there¬ %0aof infuses itself into these milky secretions, and so kills the %0avegetation in its birth. The measure of the injury so inflicted %0aon the earth depends, in each climate, upon the combination of %0athe one or other of these causes; and hence it is that it is not %0afelt in equal intensity throughout the whole earth, nor even pre¬ %0acisely at the same moment of time. We have already*® said %0athat the Eagle rises in Italy on the thirteenth day®^ before the %0acalends of January, and the ordinary course of Hature does %0anot permit us before that period to reckon with any degree of %0acertainty upon the fruits of the earth ; for if the moon should %0ahappen to be in conjunction at that time, it will be a necessary %0aconsequence, that all the winter fruits, as well as the early %0aones, will receive injury more or less. %0a%0aThe life led by the ancients was rude and illiterate; still, %0aas will be readily seen, the observations they made were not %0aless remarkable for ingenuity than are the theories of the pre¬ %0asent day. With them there were three set periods for gather¬ %0aing in the produce of the earth, and it was in honour of these %0aperiods that they instituted the festive days, known as the %0a%0aAn onomatic prejudice, as Fee says, solely founded on the peculiarity %0aof the name. %0a%0aIn the preceding Chapter. 59 preceding Chapter. %0a%0a6 ® In B. xvi. c. 42. ei Twentieth of December. %0a%0a%0aChap. 69.] %0a%0a%0aCAUSES OF STEEILrxr. %0a%0a%0a99 %0a%0a%0aliobigalia,®' the Florolia, and the Vinalia. The Hohigalia were %0aestablished by Nunia in the fortietli year of his reign, and are %0astill celebrated on the seventh day before the calends of May, %0aas it is at this period that mildew®^ mostly makes its first at¬ %0atacks upon the growing corn. Varro fixes this crisis at the %0amoment at which the sun enters the tenth degree of Taurus, %0ain accordance with the notions that prevailed in his day : but %0athe real cause is the fact, that thirty-one®^ days after the vernal %0aequinox, according to the observations of various nations, the %0aDog-star sets betw'cen the seventh and fourth before the ca¬ %0alends of Ma)^ a constellation baneful in itself, and to appease %0awhich a young dog should first be sacrificed.®® The same people %0aalso, in the year of the City 513, instituted the Floralia, a %0afestival held upon the fourth before®® the calends of May, in %0aaccordance with the oracular injunctions of the Sibyl, to secure %0aa favourable season for the blossoms and flowers. Varro fixes %0athis day as the time at which the sun enters the fourteenth %0adegree of Taurus. If there should happen to be a full moon %0aduring the four days at this period, injury to the corn and all %0athe plants that are in blossom, will be the necessary result. %0a'J’he First Vinalia, which in ancient times were established on %0athe ninth before ®’ the calends of May, for the purpose of tast¬ %0aing®® the wines, have no signification whatever in reference to %0athe fruits of the earth, any more than the festivals already %0amentioned have in reference to the vine and the olive; the %0agermination of these last not commencing, in fact, till the %0arising of the Vergiliae, on the Sixth day before®* the ides of %0a%0a®- Or festival in honour of Robigo, the Goddess of mildew, on the %0atwenty-fifth of April.

Hardouin ob¬ %0aserves, that it is abundantly proved from the ancient writers that it was %0athe custom to sacrifice a puppy to Sirius, or tlie Dog-star, at the Robigalia. %0aAs Littre justly remarks, it would almost appear that Pliny intended, by %0ahis ambiguous language, to lead his readers into error. %0a%0a®® Twenty-eighth of April.

For my %0apart, I am of opinion that tlie eighth befoi’e the calends of %0aJuly, the day of the summer solstice, must be a critical day, for %0aa similar reason; and that the rising of the Dog-star, twenty- %0athree days after the summer solstice, must be so too, in case %0athe moon is then in conjunction ; for the excessive heat is pro¬ %0aductive of injurious effects, and the grape becomes prematurely %0aripened, shrivelled, and tough. Again, if there is a full moon %0aon the fourth before’® the nones of Jill)^ when Canicula rises %0ato the people of Egypt, or at least on the sixteenth be¬ %0afore the calends of August, when it risf's in Italy, it is pro¬ %0aductive of injurious results. The same is the case, too, from %0athe thirteenth day before the calends of August, when the %0aEagle sets, to the tenth before’® the calends of that month. %0aThe Second Vinalia, which are celebrated on the fourteenth” %0abefore the calends of September, bear no reference to these in¬ %0afluences. Varro fixes them at the period at which the Lyre %0abegins its morning setting, and says that this indicates the be¬ %0aginning of autumn, the day having been set apart for the pur¬ %0apose of propitiating the w-eather : at the present day, however, %0ait is observed that the Lyre sets on the sixth before’® the ides %0aof August. %0a%0aWithin these periods there are exerted the sterilizing in¬ %0afluences of the heavens, though I am far from denying that %0athey may be 'considerably modified by the nature of the locality, %0aaccording as it is cold or hot. Still, however, it is sufficient for %0ame to have demonstrated the theory ; the modifications of its re¬ %0asults depending, in a great degree, upon attentive observation. %0aIt is beyond all question too, that either one of these two causes %0a%0aIn B. xvi. c. 42, and in c. 66 of this Book. %0a%0aSecond of June.

And here it %0asuggests itself how greatly we ought to admire the bounteous %0aI)rovisions made for us by Nature ; for, in the first place, these %0acalamitous results cannot by any possibility befall us every year, %0ain consequence of the fixed revolutions of the stars; nor indeed, %0awhen they do happen, beyond a few nights in the year, and it %0amay be easil)' known beforehand which nights those are likely %0ato be. In order, too, that we might not have to apprehend these %0ainjuries to vegetation in all the months. Nature has so ordained %0athat the times of the moon’s conjunction in summer, and of the %0afull moon in winter, with the exception of two days only at %0athose respective periods, are well ascertained, and that there is %0ano danger to be apprehended on any but the nights of summer, %0aand those nights the shortest of all; in the daj^-time, on the %0aother hand, there is nothing to fear. And then, besides, these %0ajthaenomena may be so easily understood, that the ant even, %0athat most diminutive of insects, takes its rest during the moon’s %0aconjunction, but toils on, and that during the night as well,when %0athe moon is at the full; the bird, too, called the “parra”'* %0adisappears upon the day on which Sirius rises, and never re¬ %0aappears until that star has set; while the witwall,®“ on the %0aother hand, makes its appearance on the day of the summer %0asolstice. The moon, however, is productive of no noxious %0aeffects at either of these periods, except when the nights are %0aclear, and every movement of the air is lulled ; for so long as %0aclouds prevail, or the wind is blowing, the night' dews never %0afall. And then, besides, there are certain remedies to counter¬ %0aact these noxious influences. %0a%0aCHAP. 70 . —KEMEDIES AGAINST THESE NOXTOOS INFLUENCES. %0a%0aWhen you have reason to fear these influences, make bon¬ %0afires in the fields and vineyards of cuttings or heaps of chaff, or %0aelse of the weeds that have been rooted up ; the smokewill %0aact as a good preservative.

Those plants, however, %0awhich are in bud must not be spaded at the roots, except where %0athe soil is particularly rich. The seed-plots, too, must be well %0acleared with the hoe, the barley-harvest got in, and the %0athreshing-floor prepared for the harvest with chalk, as Cato®* %0atells us, slackened with amurca of olives; Virgil®® makes men¬ %0ation of a method still more laborious even.

In other countries the stalks are cut %0aM'ith the sickle in the middle, and the ears are separated by %0athe aid of paddle-forks.®® In some places, again, the corn is %0atorn up by the roots; and it is asserted by those who adopt %0athis plan, that it is as good as a light turning up for the ground, %0awhereas, in reality, the)’^ deprive it of its juices.®® There are %0adifferences in other respects also : in places where they thatch %0aiheir houses with straw, they keep the longest haulms for that %0apurpose ; and where hay is scarce, they employ the straw for %0alitter. -The straw of panic is never used for thatching, and %0athat of millet is mostly burnt; barley-straw, however, is %0aalways preserved, as being the most agreeable of all as a food %0afor oxen. In the Gallic provinces panic and millet are gathered, %0aear by ear, with the aid of a comb carried in the hand. %0a%0aIn some places the corn is beaten out by machines®* upon %0athe threshing-floor, in others by the feet of mares, and in %0a%0a3'* Palladius gives a long description of this contrivance, which seems to %0ahave been pushed forward by the ox; the teeth, which were sharp at the %0aedge and fine at the point, catching the ears and tearing them off. But, %0aas Fee says, the use of it must have been very disadvantageous, in conse¬ %0aquence of the unequal height of the stalks. The straw, too, was sacrificed %0aby the employment of it. %0a%0aIn contrarium juncto. %0a%0a“ Merges.” Supposed to be the same as the “ hatillum” of Varro. %0aIts form is unknown, and, indeed, the manner in which it was used. It is %0anot improbable that it was a fork, sharp at the edge, and similar to an %0aopen pair of scissars, with which the heads of corn were driven off, as it %0awere ; this, however, is only a mere conjecture. By the use of “ atque,” %0ait would almost appear that the “merges” was employed after the sickle %0ahad been used; but it is more probable that he refers to two different me¬ %0athods of gathering the ears of corn. %0a%0a** The roots and the stubble are, in reality, as good as a manure to the %0aland. %0a%0aCalled “ trihulum a threshing-machine moved by oxen.

The later wheat is cut, the more prolific* %0ait is; but if it is got in early, the grain is finer and stronger. %0aThe best rule is to cut it before the grain liardens, and just %0aas it is changing colour though the oracles on husbandr}' %0asay that it is better to begin the harvest two daj's too soon %0athan two days too late. Winter and other wheat must be %0atreated exactly the same way both on the threshing-floor and %0ain the granary. Spelt, as it is ditficult to be threshed, should %0abe stored with the chaff on, being only disengaged of the straw %0aand the beard. , %0a%0aMany countries make use of chaff* for hay; the smoother %0aand thinner it is, and the more nearly resembling dust, the %0abetter ; hence it is that the chaff* of millet is considered the %0a.best, that of barley being the next best, and that of wheat the %0aAvorst of all, except for beasts that are hard worked. In stony %0a])laces they break the haulms, when dr}', with staves, for the %0acattle to lie upon: if there is a deficiency of chaff, the straw %0aas well is ground for food. The following is the method em¬ %0aployed in prepai’ing it: it is cut early and sprinkled with bay %0asalt,* after which it is dried and rolled up in trusses, and given %0ato the oxen as wanted, instead of hay. Some persons set fire %0ato the stubble in the fields, a plan that has been greatly ex¬ %0atolled by Virgil the chief merit of it is that the seed of the %0aAveeds is effectually destroyed. The diversity of the raethod.s %0aemployed in harvesting mainly depends upon the extent of the %0acrops and the price of labour. %0a%0aCHAP. 73 -THE METHODS OF STORING CORN. %0a%0aConnected Avith this branch of our subject is the method of %0astoring corn. Some persons recommend that granaries should %0abe built for the purpose at considerable expense, the walls %0a%0aOn the contrary, Fee says, the risk is greater from tlie depredations %0aof birds, and the chance of the grain falling out in cutting, and gathering %0ain. Spelt and rye may be left much longer than Avheat or oats. %0a%0a* Columella, B. ii. c. i., gives the same advice. %0a%0a“Palea” seems here to mean “chaff;" though Fee understands it %0aas meaning stravr. %0a%0aThe chaff of millet, and not the straw, must evidently be intended here, %0afor he says above that the straw—“ culmus ”—of millet is generally burnt. %0a%0a* Muria dura. %0a%0a* Georg, i. 84, et seq. Fee says that Virgil has good reason for his %0acommendations, as it is a most excellent plan. %0a%0a%0aChap. 73.] TIIK METHODS OF STORINO CORN". 105 %0a%0abeing made of brick, and not less than three^ feet thick ; tiio %0acorn, they say, should be let in from above, the air heiiig %0acarefully excluded, and no windows allowed. Others, again, %0asay that the granary should have an aspect in no direction hut %0athe north-east or north, and that the walls should be built %0awithout lime, that substance being extremely injurious'' to %0acorn ; as to Avhat Ave find recommended in reference toamurca %0aof olives, Ave have already mentioned it on a former® occasion. %0aIn some places they build their granaries of wood, and upon %0apillars,® thinking it the best plan to leave access for the air on %0aevery side, and from below CAmn. Some persons think, how¬ %0aever, that the grain diminishes in bulk if laid on a floor above %0athe lev^el of the ground, and that it is liable to ferment beneath %0aa roof of tiles. Many persons say, too, that the grain should %0anever be stirred up to air’ it, as the weevil is never known to %0apenetrate beyond four fingers in depth ; consequent!)', beyond %0athat depth there is no danger. According to Columella,® the %0aAvest wind is beneficial to grain, a thing that surprises me, as %0athat Avind is generally a A'ery parching® one. Some persons %0arecommend that, before housing the corn, a bramble-frog %0ashould be hung up by one of the hind legs at the threshold of %0athe granary. To me it appears that the most important pre¬ %0acaution of all is to house the grain at the prpper time; for if %0ait is unripe when cut, and not sufficiently firm, or if it is got %0ain in a heated state, it follows of necessity that noxious in¬ %0asects will breed in it. %0a%0aThere are several causes which contribute to the preserva¬ %0ation of grain; the outer'® coats in some kinds are more nu¬ %0amerous, as in millet, for instance; the juices are of an olea¬ %0aginous nature," and so supply ample moisture, as in sesame, %0afor example ; while in other kinds, again, they are naturally %0a%0a^ Pall.adius, i. 19, says tico feet. %0a%0a* Oil account of the damp.

In barle)' the chatf is thinner, and the same is the %0acase with all the leguminous seeds : it is for this reason that they %0ado not ordinarily breed insects. The bean, however, is covered %0awith a coat of a thicker substance ; and hence it is that it fer¬ %0aments. Some persons sprinkle wheat, in order to make it %0akeep the longer, ■wnth amurca'® of olives, a quadrantal to a %0athousand modii: others, again, with powdered Chalcidian or %0aCarian chalk, or with worm-wood.*^ There is a certain earth %0afound at Olynthus, and at Cerinthus, in Euboea, which pre¬ %0avents grain from spoiling. If garnered in the ear, grain is %0ahardly ever found to suffer any injur)L %0a%0aThe best plan, however, of preserving grain, is to lay it up %0ain trenches, called “ siri,” as they do in Cappadocia, Thracia, %0aSpain, and at * * * in Africa. Particular care is taken to %0adig these trenches in a dry soil, and a layer of chaff is then %0aplaced at the bottom ; the grain, too, is always stored in the %0aear. In this case, if no air is allo-wed to penetrate to the com, %0awe may rest assured that no noxious insects will ever breed %0ain it. Varro*® says, that wheat, if thus stored, will keep as %0along as fifty years, and millet a hundred ; and ho assures us %0athat beans and other leguminous grain, if put away in oil jars %0awith a covering of ashes, will keep for a great length of time. %0aHe makes a statement, also, to the effect that some beans were %0apreserved in a cavern in Ambracia from the time of King %0aPyrrhus until the Piratical War of Pompeius Magnus, a period %0aof about two hundred and twenty years. %0a%0aThe chick-pea is the only grain in which no insect will %0abreed while in the granary. Some persons place upon the %0aheaps of the leguminous grains pitchers full of vinegar and %0acoated with pitch, a stratum of ashes being laid beneath; and %0athey fancy that if this is done, no injury will happen. Some, %0aagain, store them in vessels which have held salted provisions, %0a■with a coating of plaster on the top, ■wdiile other persons are %0a%0a*2 And so repel the attacks of insects. %0a%0aThis would not only spoil the flavour, but absolutely injure the com %0aas well. %0a%0aThis also, if practised to any extent, would infallibly spoil the srain. %0a%0a>5 De Ke Rust. i. 37.

(31.) —THE VINTAGE, AND THE WORKS OF AUTUMN. %0a%0aIn accordance with the ordinary divisions of the year, we %0anow come to autumn, a period which extends from the setting %0aof the Lyre to the autumnal equinox, and from that to the %0asetting of the Vergilim and the beginning of winter. In these %0aintervals, the more important periods are marked b}’- the rising %0aof the Horse to the people of Attica, in the evening of the day %0abefore the ides of August; upon which day also the Dolphin %0asets in Egypt, and, according to Caesar, in Italy. On the %0aeleventh before the calends of September, the star called the %0aVintager begins to rise in the morning, according to Caesar’s %0areckoning, and to the people of Assyria: it announces the %0aripening of the vintage, a sure sign of which is the change of %0acolour in the grape. On the fifth before the calends of Sep¬ %0atember, the Arrow sets in Assyria, and the Etesian winds cease %0ato blow : on the nones of September, the Vintager rises in %0aEgypt, and in the morning of that day, Arcturus rises to the %0apeople of Attica: on the same morning, too, the Arrow sets. %0aOn the fifth before the ides of September, according to Caesar, %0athe She-Ooat rises in the evening; and one half of Arcturus %0abecomes visible on the day before*^ the ides of September, being %0aportentous^ of boisterous weather for five days, both by land %0aand sea. %0a%0aThe theory relative to the effects produced by Arcturus, is %0astated in tbe following terms: if showers prevail, it is said, at %0athe setting of the Dolphin, they wdll not cease so long as %0aArcturus is visible.

According to Ceesar, this constellation rises on %0athe fourteenth “ before the calends, and it affords its prognostics %0ato the Assyrians on the thirteenth. On the eleventh before^ %0athe calends of October, the point of junction*’ in Pisces disap- %0apears, and upon the eighth is the autumnal equinox. It is %0aa remarkable fact, and rarely the case, that Philippus, Callip- %0apus, Dositheus, Parmeniscus, Conon,*® Criton, Democritus, and %0aEudoxus, all agree that the She-Goat rises in the morning of %0athe fourth before the calends of October, and on the third %0athe Kids. On the sixth day before the nones of October, the %0aCrown rises in the morning to the people of Attica, and upon %0athe morning of the fifth,** the Charioteer sets.

After the setting of the Lyre, Vetches should %0abe sown, kidney-beans and hay-grass : it is generally recom¬ %0amended that this should he done wliile the moon is in con¬ %0ajunction. This, too, is the proper time for gathering in the %0aleaves: it is fair work for one woodman, to fill four baskets ** %0ain the day. If the leaves are gathered while the moon is on %0athe wane, they will not decay; they ought not to he dry, %0ahowever, when gathered. %0a%0aThe ancients were of opinion, that the vintage is never ripe %0abefore the equinox ; but at the present day I find that it is %0agathered in before that period ; it ivill be as well, therefore, %0ato give the signs and indications by which the proper moment %0amay be exactly ascertained. The rules I'or getting in the vin¬ %0atage are to the following effect: Never gather the grape in a %0aheated state,^® or in other words, when the weather is dry, and %0abefore the rains have fallen ; nor ought it to be gathered when %0acovered with dew,—or in other words, when dews have fallen %0aduring the night,—nor yet before the dews have been dispelled %0aby the sun. Commence the vintage when the bearing-shoots %0abegin to recline upon the stem, or when, after a grape is re¬ %0amoved from the bunch, the space left empty is not filled up; %0athis being a sure proof that the berry has ceased to increase in %0asize. It is of the greatest consequence to the grape, that it %0ashould he gathered while the rnoon is on the increase. Each %0apressing should fill twenty culei,^® that being the fair propor¬ %0ation. To fill twenty cuhu and vats '*'' from twenty jugera of %0avineyard, a single press will be enough. In pressing the grape, %0asome persons use a single press-board, but it is a better plan %0a%0aIn c. 3-5 of this Book. %0a%0a“ Frondarias fiscinas.” These must have been baskets of a very large %0asize. The leaves were used for fodder. %0a%0aThis, F’ee says, is diainetrieally opposite to the modern practice. %0a%0aThe “ culeus,” it is supposed, was of the same measure of capacity as the %0a•‘doliura,”and held twenty amphorae. Tlie “ pressura,” or “ pressing." was %0aprobably the utmost quantity that the pressing vat would hold at one time. %0a%0a*' “ Lacus.” %0a%0a%0a110 %0a%0a%0apuny’s natural history. %0a%0a%0a[Hook XVIII. %0a%0a%0ato employ two, however large the single ones may be. It is tiie %0alength of them that is of the greatest consecpience, and not tfie %0athickness : if wide, however, they press the fruit all the better. %0aThe ancients used to screw down the press-boards with ropes %0aand leather thongs, worked by levers. Within the last hundred %0ayears the Gfeek press has been invented, with Giick spiral %0agrooves running down the ■'® stem. To this stem there are %0aspokes attached, which project like the rays of a star, and by %0ameans of which the stem is made to lift a box filled with stones %0a—a method that is very highly approved of. It is only within %0athe last two-and-twenty years, that a plan has been discovered %0aof employing smaller press-boards, and a less unwieldy press: %0ato effect this, the height has been reduced, and the stem of the %0ascrew placed in the middle, the whole pressure being concen¬ %0atrated upon broad planks ■'® placed over the grapes, which are %0acovered also with heavy weights above. %0a%0aThis is the proper time forgathering fruit; the best moment %0afor doing so is when it has begun to fall Ihrough ripeness, %0aand not from the effects of the weather. This is the season, %0atoo, for extracting the lees of wine, and for boiling defrutum %0athis last must be done on a night when there is no moon, or if %0ait is a full moon, in the day-time. At other times of the year, %0ait must he done either before the moon has risen, or after it %0ahas set. The grapes employed for this purpose should never %0abe gathered from a young vine, nor yet from a tree that is %0agrown in a marshy spot, nor should any grapes be used but %0athose that are perfectlj'^ ripe : the liquor, too, should never be %0askimmed with anything but a leaf,®‘ for if the vessel should %0ahappen to be touched with wood, the liquor, it is generally %0athought, will have a burnt and smoky flavour. %0a%0aThe pjroper time for the vintage is between the equinox and %0athe setting of the Vergiliae, a period of forty-four days. It is %0aa saying among the growers, that to pitch wine-vessels after %0athat day, in consequence of the coldness of the weather, is only %0aso much time lost. Still, however, I have seen, before now, %0apersons getting in the vintage on the calends of January “ %0a%0a18 o Mali rugis per cocleas bullantibus.” The whole of this passage is %0afull of difficulties. %0a%0a18 “ Tympanaliterally, “ drums.” %0a%0a50 Grape juice boiled down to one half; see B. xiv. c. 9. %0a%0a51 Virgil mentions this in the Georgies, B i. 29-5. Of course, it is no¬ %0athing but an absurd superstition. %0a%0a52 First of January. %0a%0a%0a%0a%0aCliap. 7-5.] THE REVOLUTIOXS OF THE MOOH. %0a%0a%0aIll %0a%0a%0aeven, in consequence of the want of wine- vessels, and putting %0athe must into receivers,® or else pouring the old wine out of %0aits vessels, to ±ake room for new liquor of a very doubtful %0aquality.

The %0amethod that is adopted by the most economical managers, is %0ato use the produce supplied djy each year,® and this, too, is %0afound in the end the most lucrative mode of proceeding. As %0afor the other details relative to wines, they have been discussed %0aat suflicient length already and it has been stated on a pre¬ %0avious occasion,® that as soon as the vintage is got in, the olives %0ashould at once be gathered, with other particulars relative %0ato the olive after the setting of the Yergiliae. %0a%0aCHAP. 75. (32.) -THE EEVOLTJTIONS OF THE MOON. %0a%0aI shall now proceed to add some necessary information re¬ %0alative to the moon, the winds, and certain signs and prognos¬ %0atics, in order that I may complete the observations I have to %0amake with reference to the sidereal system. Virgil® has even %0agone so far, in imitation of Democritus, as to assign certain %0aoperations to certain days® of the moon ; but my sole object %0asliall be, as, indeed, it has been throughout this work, to con¬ %0asult that utility Mdiich is based upon a knowledge and appre¬ %0aciation of general principles. %0a%0aAll vegetable productions are cut, gathered, and housed to %0amore advantage while the moon is on the wane than while it %0ais on the increase. Manure must never be touched except %0awhen the moon is on the wane; and land must be manured %0amore particularly while the moon is in conjunction, or else at %0athe first quarter. Take care to geld your boars, bulls, rams, %0aand kids, while the moon is on the wane. Put eggs under the %0ahen at a new moon. Make your ditches in the night-time, %0awhen the moon is at full.

It is generally recommended, too, to give an airing %0ato corn and the leguminous grains, and to garner them, towards %0athe end of the moon; to make seed-plots when the moon %0ais above the horizon; and to tread out the grape, to fell tim¬ %0aber, and to do many other things that have be(‘n mentioned %0ain their respective places, when the moon is below it. %0a%0aThe observation of tbe moon, in general, as already ob¬ %0aserved in the Second Book,®^ is not so very easy, but what I %0aam about here to state even rustics will be able to comprehend: %0aso long as the moon is seen in the west, and during the earlier %0ahours of the night, she will be on the increase, and one half %0aof her disk will be j^erceived ; but when the moon is seen to %0arise at sun-set and opposite to the sun, so that they are both %0aperceptible at the same moment, she will be at full. Again, %0aas often as the moon rises in the east, and does not give her %0alight in the earlier hours of the night, but shows herstdf %0aduring a portion of the day, she will be on the wane, and one %0ahalf of her only will again be perceptible : when the moon has %0aceased to be visible, she is in conjunction, a period known to %0aus as “ interlunium.”®“ During the conjunction, the moon will %0abe above the horizon the same time as the sun, for the whole %0aof the first day; on the second, she will advance iipon the %0anight ten-twelfths of an hour and one-fourth of a twelfth %0aon the third day, the same as on the second, and * * * so on %0ain succession up to the fifteenth day, the same proportional parts %0aof an hour being added each day. On the fifteenth day she will %0abe above the horizon all night, and below it all day. On the %0asixteenth, she will remain below the horizon ten-twelfths of %0aan hour, and one-fourth of a twelfth, at the first hour of the %0anight, and so on in the same proportion day after day, up to %0athe period of her conjunction ; and thus, the same time which, %0aby remaining under the horizon, she withdraws from the first %0apart of the night, she will add to the end of the night by %0aremaining above the horizon. Her revolutions, too, will %0aoccupy thirty days one month, and twenty-nine the next, and %0aso on alternately.

Having thus changed his position, %0aso as to bring the point of the sun’s rising on that day to the %0aright, and that of his setting to the left, it will be the sixth %0ahour of the day, at the moment when the shadow straight %0abefore him is the shortest. Through the middle of this %0ashadow, taken lengthwise, a furrow must be traced in the %0aground with a hoe, or else a line drawn with ashes, some %0atwenty feet in length, say; in the middle of this line, or, in %0aother words, at the tenth foot in it, a small circle must then %0abe described: to this circle we may give the name of the %0a“ umbilicus,” or “ navel.” That point in the line which lies %0aon the side of the head of the shadow will be, the point from %0awhich the north wind blows. You who are engaged in prun¬ %0aing trees, be it your care that the incisions made in the wood %0ado not face this point; nor should the vine-trees®® or the vines %0ahave this aspect, except in the climates of Africa,®’ Cyrenae, or %0aEgypt. When the wind blows, too, from this point, you must %0anever plough, nor, in fact, attempt any other of the operations %0aof which we shall have to make mention.®® %0a%0aThat part of the line which lies between the umbilicus and %0athe feet of the shadow ■will look towards the south, and indi¬ %0acate the point from which the south wind®® blows, to which, %0aas already mentioned,’® the Greeks have given the name of %0aNotus. When the wind comes from this quarter, you, hus¬ %0abandman, must never fell wood or touch the vine.

Let those be on their guard %0aagainst this wind upon the four’^ days at the rising of the %0aVergiliaj, who are engaged in planting the olive, as well as %0athose who are employed in the operations of grafting or ino¬ %0aculating. %0a%0aIt will he as well, too, here to give some advice, in reference %0ato the climate of Ital}’’, as to certain precautions to be observed %0aat certain hours of the day. You, woodman, must never lop %0athe branches in the middle of the day; and you, shepherd, %0awLen you see midday approaching in summer, and the shadow %0agradually decreasing, drive your flocks from out of the sun %0ainto some well-shaded spot. When you lead the flocks to pas¬ %0ature in summer, let them face the west before midday,'’^ and %0aafter that time, the east: if this precaution is not adopted, %0acalamitous results will ensue; the same, too, if the flocks are %0aled in winter or spring to pastures covered with dew. Nor %0amust you let them feed with their faces to the north, as already %0amentionedfor the wdnd will either close their eyes or else %0amake them bleared, and they will die of looseness.

(34.)—THE LAYING OUT OF LANDS ACCORDING TO THE %0aPOINTS OF THE WIND. %0a%0aWe have already stated^® that the umbilicus should be de¬ %0ascribed in the middle of the line. Let another line be drawn %0atransversely through the middle of it, and it will be found to %0arun from due east to due west; a trench cut through the land %0ain accordance with this line is known by the name of “ decu- %0ainanus.” Two other lines must then be traced obliquely %0aacross them in the form of the letter X, in such a way as to %0a%0aIncendia. %0a%0a'* See B. xvii. c. 2. gge B. viii. c. 75. %0a%0aHe seems to be in error here, as he has nowhere made mention of this. %0a%0aAristotle, on the other hand, and Columella, B. vii. c. 3, say “ males." %0aSee also B. viii. c. 72, where males are mentioned in connection with tho %0anorth-wind.

All these lines must pass %0atlirough the centre of the umbilicus, aud all must be of corre¬ %0asponding length, and at equal distances. This method should %0aalways be adopted in lajung out land; or if it should be found %0anecessary to employ it irequently, a plan” of it may be made %0aill wood, sticks of equal length being fixed upon the surface %0aof a small tambour,’** but perfectly round. In the method %0awhich I am here explaining, it is necessary to point out one %0aprecaution that must always be observed by those who are %0aunacquainted with the subject. The point that must be veri¬ %0afied first of all is the south, as that is always the same; but %0athe sun, it must be remembered, rises every daj- at a point in %0athe heavens different to that of his rising on the day before, %0aso that the east must never be taken as the basis for tracing %0athe lines. %0a%0aHaving now ascertained the various points of the heavens, %0athe extremity of the line that is nearest to the north, but lying %0ato the east of it, will indicate the solstitial rising, or, in other %0aAvords, the rising of the sun on the longest day, as also the %0apoint from which the wind Aquilo’® blows, known to the Greeks %0aby the name of Boreas. You should plant all trees and vines %0afacing this point, but take care never to plough, or sow corn, %0aor plant in seed plots, while this wind is blowing, for it has the %0aeffect of drying up and blasting the roots of the trees while %0abeing transplanted. Be taught in time—one thing is good for %0agrown trees, another for them while they are but young. Hoi %0ahave I forgotten the fact, that it is at this point of the heavens %0athat the Greeks place the wind, to which they give the name %0aof Coecias; Aristotle, a man of most extensive learning, who %0ahas assigned to Caecias this position, explains that it is in con¬ %0asequence of the convexity of the earth, that Aquilo blows in %0aan opposite direction to the wind called Africus. %0a%0aTlie agriculturist, however, has nothing to fear from Aquilo, %0ain respect to the operations before mentioned, all the year %0athrough; for this wind is softened by the sun in the middle of %0a%0a” Very similar to our compass, but describing only eight points of %0athe wind, instead of thirty two. %0a%0a7» i* Tympanum,” a drum, similar in shape to our tambourines or else %0akettle-drums. %0a%0aSee B. ii. c. 46. %0a%0a%0a116 %0a%0a%0aPliny’s natuual histoey. %0a%0a%0a[Book XVIIl. %0a%0a%0athe summer, and, changing its name, is known by that of Etc- %0asias.®® ^Tien you feel the cold, then, be on your guard; tor, %0awhatever the noxious effects that are attributed to Aquilo, tlie %0amore sensibly will they be felt when the wind blows from due %0anorth. In Asia, Greece, Spain, the coasts of Italy, Campania, %0aand Apulia, the trees that support the vines, as well as the %0avines themselves, should have an aspect towards the north-east. %0aIf you wish to have male produce, let the flock feed in such %0aa way, that this wdnd may have the opportunity of fecunda¬ %0ating the male, whose office it is to fecundate the females. Ihe %0aw’ind Africus, known to the Greeks bj^ the name of Libs, blows %0afrom the south-w^est, the opposite point to Aquilo; when %0aanimals, after coupling, turn their heads towards this quarter,®* %0ayou may be sure that female produce has been conceived. %0a%0aThe third ®* line from the north, which ive have drawn trans¬ %0aversely through the shadow, and called by the name of “ de- %0acumanus,” will point due east, and from this quarter the wind %0aSubsolanus blows, by the Greeks called Apeliotes. It is to %0athis point that, in healthy localities, farm-houses and vineyards %0aare made to look. This wind is accompanied with soft, gentle %0ashowers; Favonius, however, the wind that blows from due %0awest, the opposite quarter to it, is of a drier nature ; by the %0aGreeks it is known as Zephyrus. Cato has recommended that %0aolive-yards should look due west. It is this wind that begins %0athe spring, and opens the earth; it is moderately cool, but %0ahealthy. As soon as it begins to prevail, it indicates that the %0atime has arrived for pruning the vine, weeding the corn, plant¬ %0aing trees, grafting fruit-trees, and trimming the olive; for its %0abreezes are productive of the most nutritious effects. %0a%0aThe fourth ®® line from the north, and the one that lies nearest %0athe south on the eastern side, will indicate the point of the %0asun’s rising at the winter solstice, and the wind Volturnus, %0aknown by the name of Eurus to the Greeks. This wind is %0awarm and diy, and beehives and vineyards, in the climates of %0aItaly and the Gallic provinces, should face this quarter. %0aDirectly opposite to Volturnus, the wind Corns blows; it in¬ %0adicates the point of the sun’s setting at the summer solstice. %0a%0aOr the “ summer” wind. 8i Africus, or south-west. %0a%0a*2 Or, according to our mode of expression, the “second,” or “next %0abut one.” %0a%0a‘’3 Or, as we say, the “ third.’ %0a%0a%0aChap. 78.] PllOGNObXICS DEEIYED FKOM THE STTN. 117 %0a%0aand lies on the western side next to the north. By the Greeks %0ait is called Argestes, and is one of the verj’^ coldest of the winds, %0awhich, in fact, is the case with all the winds that blow from the %0anorth; this wind, too, brings hailstorms with it, for which %0areason it is necessary to be on our guard against it no less than %0athe north. If Volturnus begins to blow from a clear quarter %0aof the heavens, it will not last till night; but if it is Subso- %0alanus, it will prevail for the greater part of the night. What¬ %0aever the Avind that may happen to be blowing, if it is accom¬ %0apanied by heat, it will be sure to last for several daj's.

(35.) —PROGNOSTICS DERIVED FROM THE SUN. %0a%0aHaving now explained the theory of the winds, it seems to %0ame the best plan, in order to avoid any repetition, to pass on to %0athe other signs and prognostics that are indicative of a change %0aof Aveather. I find, too, that this is a kind of knowledge that %0agreatly interested Virgil,®^ for he mentions the fact, that during %0athe harvest even, he has often seen the Avinds engage in a %0acombat that was absolutely ruinous to the improvident agri¬ %0aculturist. There is a tradition, too, to the effect that Demo¬ %0acritus, already mentioned, Avhen his brother Daraasus was get¬ %0ating in his harvest in extremely hot weather, entreated him to %0aleave the rest of the crop, and house Avith all haste that which %0ahad been cut; and it was only within a very few hours that %0ahis prediction was verified by a most violent storm. On the %0aother hand, it is particularly recommended never to plant reeds %0aexcept when rain is impending, and only to sow corn just be¬ %0afore a shower ; we shall therefore briefly touch upon the prog¬ %0anostics of this description, making enquiry more particularly %0ainto those among them that have been found the most useful. %0a%0aIn the first place, then, we Avill consider those prognostics %0aof the weather Avhich are derived from the sun.®® If the sun is %0abright at its rising, and not burning hot, it is indicatrte of fine %0a%0aGeorg, i. 313, et seq. %0a%0a“ ISiepe ego, quum flavis messorem induceret arvis %0aAgricola, et fragili jam stringeret hordea culmo. %0a%0aOmnia ventorum concurrere proelia vidi.” %0a%0a®® See the Treatise of Theophrastus on the Prognostics of the Weather. %0a%0a%0aPLINr’s NAT U UAL UI STOUT. %0a%0a%0a[Book XVIII. %0a%0a%0a118 %0a%0a%0aweather, but if pale, it announces wintry weather accompanied %0awith hail. If the sun is bright and clear when it sets, and %0aif it rises with a similar appearance, the more assured oi tine %0aweather may we feel ourselves. It it is hidden in clouds at %0aits rising, it is indicative of l ain, and of wind, when the clouds %0aare of a reddish colour just before sunrise ; if black clouds aio %0aintermingled with the red ones, they betoken rain as \\ell. %0aWhen the sun’s rays at its rising or setting appear to unite, %0arainy weather may be looked for. When the clouds are red at %0asunset, they give promise ^ of a fine day on the morrow; but %0aif, at the sun’s rising, the clouds are dispersed in various quar¬ %0aters, some to the south, and some to the north-east, even though %0athe heavens in the vicinity of the sun may be bright, they are %0asignificant of rain and wind. If at the sun’s rising gr set¬ %0ating, its rays appear contracted, they announce the approach of %0aa shower. If it rains at sunset, or if the sun’s rays attract the %0aclouds towards them, it is portentous of stormy weather on the %0afollowing day. WHien the sun, at its rising, does not emit %0avivid rays, although there are no clouds surrounding it, rain %0amay be expected. If before sunrise the clouds collect into %0adense masses, they are portentous of a violent storm; but if %0athey are repelled from the east and travel westward, they in¬ %0adicate fine weather. When clouds are seen surrounding the %0aface of the sun, the less the light they leave, the more violent %0athe tempest will be: but if they form a double circle round %0athe sun, the storm will be a dreadful one. If this takes place %0aat sunrise or sunset, and the clouds assume a red hue, the ap¬ %0aproach of a most violent storm is announced : and if the clouds %0ahang over the face of the sun without surrounding it, they %0apresage wind from the quarter from which they are drifting, %0aand rain as well, if they come from the south. %0a%0aIf, at its rising, the sun is surrounded with a circle, wind %0amay be looked for in the quarter in which the circle breaks ; %0abut if it disappears equally throughout, it is indicative of fine %0aweather. If the sun at its rising throws out its rays afar %0athrough the clouds, and the middle of its disk is clear, there %0awill be rain; and if its rays are seen before it rises, both rain %0aand wind as well. If a white circle is seen round the sun at %0aits setting, there will be a slight storm in the night; but if there %0a%0a*® This, Fee observes, is confirmed by experience.

If the sun %0ais pale at sunset, there will be wind, and if there is a dark %0acircle round it, high winds will arise in the quarter in which %0athe circle breaks. %0a%0aCHAP. 79. —PEOGNOSTICS DERIVED FROM THE MOON. %0a%0aThe prognostics derived from the moon, assert their right to %0aoccupy our notice in the second place. In Egypt, attention is %0apaid, more particularly, to the fourth day of the moon. If, %0aAvhen the moon rises, she shines with a pure bright light, it is %0agenerally supposed that we shall have fine weather; but if she %0ais red, there will be wind, and if of a swarthy®’ hue, rain. If %0aupon the fifth day of the moon her horns are obtuse, they are %0aalways indicative of rain, but if sharp and erect, of wind, and %0athis on the fourth day of the moon more particularly. If her %0anorthern horn is pointed and erect, it portends ivind; and if it %0ais the lower horn that presents this appearance, the wind will %0ahe from the south; if both of them are erect, there will be %0ahigh winds in the night. If upon the fourth day of the moon %0ashe is surrounded by a red circle, it is portentous of wind and %0arain. %0a%0aIn Varro we find it stated to the following effect:—“ If, at %0athe fourth day of the moon, her horns are erect, there will be %0agreat storms at sea, unless, indeed, she has a circlet®® around her, %0aand that circlet unblemished; for by that sign we are informed %0athat there will be no stormy weather before full moon. If, at %0athe full moon, one half of her disk is clear, it is indicative of %0afine weather, but if it is red, of wind, and if black, of rain. If %0aa darkness comes over the face of the moon, covered with clouds, %0ain whatever quarter it breaks, from that quarter wind may be %0aexpected. If a twofold circle surrounds the moon, the storm %0awill be more violent, and even more so still, if there are three %0acircles, or if they are black, broken, and disjointed. If the new %0amoon at her rising has the upper horn obscured, there will be a %0aprevalence of rainy weather, wdien she is on the wane; but if %0ait is the lower horn that is obscured, there will be rain before %0afull moon; if, again, the moon is darkened in the middle of her %0adisk, there will be rain when she is at full. If the moon, when %0afull, has a circle round her, it indicates wdnd from the quarter %0ain the circle which is the brightest; but if at her rising the %0aSo Virgil, Georg, i. 427. ®® Coronam. %0a%0a%0a120 %0a%0a%0aPLINY’s natural HTSTOUr. %0a%0a%0a[Book XVIII. %0a%0a%0ahorns are obtuse, they are portentous of a frightful tempest. %0aIf, when the west wind prevails, the moon does not make her %0aappearance before lier fourth day, there will be a prevalence %0aof stormy weather throughout tlie month. If on the sixteenth %0aday tlie moon has a bright, flaming appearance, it is a presage %0aof violent tempests.” %0a%0aThere are eight different epochs of the moon, or periods at %0awhich she makes certain angles of incidence with the sun, and %0amost persons only notice the prognostics derived from the %0amoon, according to the places which they occupy between these %0aangles. The periods of these angles are the third day, the %0aseventh, the eleventh, the fifteenth, the nineteenth, the twenty- %0athird, the twenty-seventh, and that of the conjunction. %0a%0aCHAP. 80. -PROGNOSTICS DERIVED FROM THE STARS. %0a%0aIn the third rank must be placed the prognostics derived %0afrom the stars. These bodies are sometimes to be seen shooting %0ato and fro when this happens, winds immediately ensue, %0ain that part of the heavens in which the presage has been %0aafforded. When the heavens are equally bright thi-oughout %0atheir whole expanse, at the periods previously mentioned,®® the %0aensuing autumn will be fine and cool. If the spring and sum¬ %0amer have passed not without some rain, the autumn will be %0afine and settled,®* and there will be but little wind ; when the %0aautumn is fine, it makes a windy winter. When the bright¬ %0aness of the stars is suddenly obscured, though without®® clouds %0aor fog, violent tempests may be expected. If numerous stars %0aare seen to shoot,®® leaving a white track behind them, they %0a])resage wind from that quarter.®®* If they follow in quick suc¬ %0acession from the same quarter, the wind will blow steadily, %0abut if from various quarters of the heavens, the wind will shift %0ain sudden gusts and squalls. If circles are seen to suiTound %0aany of the planets, there will be rain.®^ In the constellation %0a%0aSee B. ii. c. 6 and c. 36.

If a fog conceals from our view the one of these %0astars which lies to the north-east, there will be high winds from %0athe south ; but if it is the star wdiich lies to the south that is so %0aobscured, then the wind will be from the north-east. The %0arainbow, when double, indicates the approach®’of rain; but %0aif seen after rain, it gives promise, though by no means a cer¬ %0atain one, of fine weather. Cfrcular clouds around some of the %0astars are indicative of rain. %0a%0aCHAP. 81. —PEOGjrOSTICS HERIVED FROM THUNDER. %0a%0aWhen, in summer, there is more thunder than lightning, . %0awind may be expected from that quarter ; but if, on the other %0ahand, there is not so much thunder as lightning, there will be %0aa fall of rain. When it lightens in a clear sky, there will be %0arain, and if there is thunder as well, stormy weather ; but if %0ait lightens from all four quarters of the heavens, there will %0abe a dreadful tempest. When it lightens from the north-east %0aonly, it portends rain on the following day ; but when from %0athe north, wind may be expected from that quarter. ^Vlien it %0alightens on a clear night from the south, the west, or the %0anorth-west, there will be wind and rain from those quarters. %0aTliunder®® in the morning is indicative of wind, and at midday %0aof raiu. %0a%0a%0aCHAP. 82. —PROGNOSTICS DERIVED FROM CLOUDS. %0a%0aWhen clouds are seen moving in a clear sky, wind may be %0aexpected in the quarter from which they proceed ; but if they %0aaccumulate in one spot, as they approach the sun thej'’ will %0adisperse. If the clouds are dispersed by a north-east wind, it %0ais a presage of high winds, but if by a wind from the south, of %0arain. If at sunset the clouds cover the heavens on either side %0aof the sun, they are indicative of tempest; if they are black %0aand lowering in the east, they threaten rain in the night, but %0aif in the west, on the following day.

So, too, if the snuff %0ahangs down, and sparks gather upon it, or if the burning coals %0aadhere ® to vessels taken from ofi[ the fire, or if the fire, when %0acovered up, sends out hot embers or emits sparks, or if the cin¬ %0aders gather into a mass upon the hearth, or the coals burn %0abright and glowing. %0a%0aCHAP. 85. -PROGNOSTICS DERIVED FROM WATER. %0a%0aThere are certain prognostics, too, that may be derived from %0a%0aTheophrastus states to a similar effect, and it is confirmed by the ex¬ %0aperience of those who live in mountainous countries. %0a%0a* We still hear of the “ white squalls” of the Mediterranean. %0a%0a* “ ‘ Behold, there ariseth a little cloud out of the sea, like a man’s %0a%0ahand.’-—And it came to pass in the meanwhile, that the heaven was %0ablack with clouds and wind, and there was a sreat rain.”—1 Kin^s. xviii. %0a44, 45. ^ %0a%0a* The truth of this.

If, when the sea is calm, the water ripples in the har¬ %0abour, with a hollow, murmuring noise, it is a sign of wind, %0aand if in winter, of rain as well. If the coasts and shores re¬ %0aecho while the sea is calm, a violent tempest may be expected ; %0aand the same when the sea, though calm, is heard to roar, or %0atlirows up foam and bubbling spray. If sea pulmones’ are %0ato be seen floating on the surface, they are portentous of stormy %0aweather for many days to come.

Cranes %0aM'heu they fly aloft in silence announce flne weather, and so %0adoes the owlet,'® when it screeches during a shower; but if it %0ais heard in fine weather, it presages a storm.

Jackdaws, when they return %0alate from feeding, give notice of stormy weather, and the same %0awith the white bu’ds,'’ when they unite in flocks, and the %0aland birds, when they descend with cries to the water and %0abesprinkle themselves, the crow more particularly.

Fee says that the swal¬ %0alow descends thus near to the surface to catch the insects on the wing, %0awhich are now disabled from rising by the hygrometric state of tlie atmo¬ %0asphere. %0a%0aThis is confirmed by experience. %0a%0a*0 On the contrary, Lucan says (Pharsalia, B. v. 1. 549), that on the ap¬ %0aproach of rain, the heron soars in the upper regions of the air ; and Virgil %0asays the same, Georg, i. 364. %0a%0a%0a%0a%0aSTJMMAnr. %0a%0a%0a125 %0a%0a%0achanges of the atmosphere.

I. (1.) —TASTE OP THE ANCIENTS POH AGEICULTUHE. %0a%3c %0a%3c w E now pass on to the Natural History of the various grains, %0a%3c of the garden plants and flowers, and indeed of all the other %0a%3c productions, with the exception of the trees and shrubs, which %0a%3c the Earth, in her bounteousness, afibrds us—a boundless field %0a%3c for contemplation, if even we regard the herbs alone, when we %0a%3c take into consideration the varieties of them, their numbers, %0a%3c the flowers they produce, their odours, their colours, their %0a%3c juices, and the numerous properties they possess—all of whicli %0a%3c have been engendered by her with a view to either the preser¬ %0a%3c vation or the gratification of the human race. %0a%3c %0a%3c On entering, however, upon this branch of my subject, it is %0a%3c my wish in the first place to plead the cause of the Earth, and %0a%3c to act as the advocate of her who is the common parent of all, %0a%3c although in the earlier ‘ part of this work I have already had %0a%3c occasion to speak in her defence. For my subject matter, as I %0a%3c proceed in the fulfilment of my task, will now lead me to con¬ %0a%3c sider her in the light of being the producer of various noxious %0a%3c substances as well; in consequence of which it is that we arc %0a%3c in the habit of charging her with our crimes, and imputing to %0a%3c her a guilt that is our own. She has produced poisons, it is %0a%3c true; but who is it but man that has found them out ? For %0a%3c the birds of the air and the beasts of the field, it is sufficient to %0a%3c he on their guard against them, and to keep at a distance from %0a%3c them.

As for ourselves, we envenom the %0a%3c point of the arrow,® and we contrive to add to the destructive %0a%3c powers of iron itself; by the aid of poisons we taint the waters %0a%3c of the stream, and we infect the various elements of Nature ; %0a%3c indeed, the very air even, which is the main support of life, %0a%3c we turn into a medium for the destruction of life. %0a%3c %0a%3c And it is not that we are to suppose that animals are igno¬ %0a%3c rant of these means of defence, for we have already had occa¬ %0a%3c sion to point ouf* the preparations which they make against the %0a%3c attacks of the serpent, and the methods they devise for effecting %0a%3c a cure when wounded by it; and yet, among them aU, there %0a%3c is not one that fights by the aid of the poison that belongs to %0a%3c another, with the sole exception of man. Let us then candidly %0a%3c confess our guilt, we who are not contented even with the %0a%3c poisons as Nature has produced them ; for by far the greater %0a%3c portion of them, in fact, are artificially prepared by the human %0a%3c hand! %0a%3c %0a%3c And then besides, is it not the fact, that there are many %0a%3c men, the very existence of whom is a baneful poison, as it %0a%3c were ? Like that of the serpent, they dart their livid tongue, %0a%3c and the venom of their disposition corrodes every object upon %0a%3c which it concentrates itself. Ever vilifying and maligning, %0a%3c like the ill-omened birds of the night, they disturb the repose %0a%3c of that darkness which is so peculiarly their own, and break %0a%3c ‘in upon the quiet of the night even, by their moans and wail¬ %0a%3c ings, the only sounds they are ever heard to emit. Like %0a%3c animals of inauspicious presage, they only cross our path to %0a%3c %0a%3c 2 Of course this is only mere declamation ; it is not probable that the %0a%3c animals have any notion at all of sharpening the weapons that nature has %0a%3c given; in addition to which, this mode of sharpening them against hard %0a%3c substances would only wear aWay the enamel, and ultimately destroy them. %0a%3c The acts of animals in a moment of rage or frenzy have evidently been %0a%3c mistaken here for the dictates of instinct, or even a superior intelligence. %0a%3c %0a%3c 3 See B.

It is in %0a%3c our high esteem for men such as these, and the commendations %0a%3c they bestow, that we shall be content to leave the others, like %0a%3c so many brakes and brambles, to the devouring flames of their %0a%3c own bad passions, and to persist in promoting the welfare of %0a%3c the human race; and this, with all the more energy and per¬ %0a%3c severance, from the circumstance that it has been our object %0a%3c throughout, rather to produce a work of lasting utility than to %0a%3c ensure ourselves a widely-spread renown. We have only to %0a%3c speak, it is true, of the fields and of rustic operations; hut %0a%3c still, it is upon these that the enjoyment of life so materially %0a%3c depends, and that the ancients conferred the very highest rank %0a%3c in their honours and commendations. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 2. (2.) -WHEN THE FIliST WREATHS OF CORN WERE USED %0a%3c %0a%3c AT ROME. %0a%3c %0a%3c Romulus was the first who established the-4.rval® priesthood %0a%3c at Rome. This order consisted of the eleven sons of Acca %0a%3c Larentia, his nurse,’ together with Romulus himself, who as¬ %0a%3c sumed the appellation of the twelfth of the brotherhood. Upon %0a%3c this priesthood he bestowed, as being the most august dis¬ %0a%3c tinction that he could confer upon it, a wreath of ears of corn, %0a%3c tied together with a wliite fillet; and this, in fact, was the %0a%3c first chaplet that was ever used at Rome. This dignity is only %0a%3c ended with life itself, and whether in exile or in captivity, it %0a%3c %0a%3c ® This sentiinent is not at all akin to the melancholy view which our %0a%3c author takes of mankind at the beginning of B. vii. and in other parts of %0a%3c this work. It is not improbable that liis censures here are levelled against %0a%3c some who had endeavoured to impede him in the progress of his work. %0a%3c %0a%3c ® “ Arvorum sacerdotes,” the priests of tlie fields. %0a%3c %0a%3c ’ Or foster-mother. It has been suggested that the Rogations of the %0a%3c Roman church may have possibly originated in the Arabarvalia, or cere¬ %0a%3c monial presided over by the Arval priesthood. %0a%3c %0a%3c B 2 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 4 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c flint’s natural niSTORT. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XVIII. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c always attends its owner. In those early days, two jugera of %0a%3c laud were considered enough for a citizen of Rome, and to none %0a%3c was a larger portion than this allotted. And yet, at the present %0a%3c day, men who but lately were the slaves of the Emperor Nero %0a%3c have been hardly content with pleasure-gardens that occupied %0a%3c the same space as this ; while they must have fishponds, for¬ %0a%3c sooth, of still greater extent, and in some instances I might %0a%3c add, perhaps, kitchens even as well. %0a%3c %0a%3c Numa first established the custom of offering corn to the %0a%3c gods, and of propitiating them with the salted® cake; he was %0a%3c the first, too, as we learn from Hemina, to parch spelt, from %0a%3c the fact that, when in this state, it is more wholesome as an %0a%3c aliment.® This method, however, he could only establish one %0a%3c way : by making an enactment, to the effect that spelt is not %0a%3c in a pure state for offering, except when parched. He it was, %0a%3c too, who instituted the Eornacalia,'® festivals appropriated %0a%3c for the parching of corn, and others,” observed with equal %0a%3c solemnity, for the erection and preservation of the “ termini,” %0a%3c or boundaries of the fields: for these termini, in those days, %0a%3c they particularly regarded as gods; while to other divinities %0a%3c they gave the names of Seia,” from “ sero,” “ to sow,” and of %0a%3c Segesta, from the “ segetes,” or “crops of standing corn,” the %0a%3c statues of which goddesses we still see erected in the Circus. %0a%3c A third divinity it is forbidden by the rules of our religion to %0a%3c name even'® beneath a roof. In former days, too, they would %0a%3c not so much as taste the com when newly cut, nor yet wine %0a%3c when just made, before the priests had made a libation of the %0a%3c first-fruits. %0a%3c %0a%3c %25 %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 3.

Salt was the emblem of %0a%3c wisdom, friendship, and other virtues. %0a%3c %0a%3c ® This, Fee observes, is not the case with any kind of wheat; with %0a%3c manioc, which has an acrid principle, the process may he necessary, in %0a%3c order to make it fit for food. %0a%3c %0a%3c Or Feast of the Furnace or Oven.

This last was one hundred and twenty feet in length; %0a%3c and two in length made a jugerum. The most considerable %0a%3c recompense that could be bestowed upon generals and valiant %0a%3c citizens, was the utmost extent of land around which a person %0a%3c could trace a furrow with the plough in a single day. The %0a%3c whole population, too, used to contribute a quarter’® of a sex- %0a%3c tarius of spelt, or else half a one, per head. %0a%3c %0a%3c From agriculture the earliest surnames were derived. Thus, %0a%3c for instance, the name of Pilumnus was given to him who in¬ %0a%3c vented the “ pilum,” or pestle of the bake-house, for pounding %0a%3c eorn ; that of Piso was derived from “ piso,” to grind com ; %0a%3c and those of Fabius, Lentulus, and Cicero, from the several %0a%3c varieties’® of leguminous plants in the cultivation of which re¬ %0a%3c spectively these individuals excelled. One individual of the %0a%3c family of the Junii received the name of “ Bubulcus,”” from %0a%3c the skill he displayed in breeding oxen. Among the sacred %0a%3c ceremonials, too, there was nothing that was held more holy %0a%3c than the marriage by confarreation,’® and the woman just %0a%3c married used to present a cake made of spelt.’® Careless cul¬ %0a%3c tivation of the land was in those times an offence / that came %0a%3c under the cognizance of the censors; and, as we learn from %0a%3c Cato,®® when it was said that such and such a man was a good %0a%3c agriculturist or a good husbandman, it was looked upon as the %0a%3c very highest compliment that could be paid him. A man %0a%3c came to be called “ locuples,” or “ rich,” from being “ loci %0a%3c plenus,” or “ full of earth.” Money, too, received its name %0a%3c of “pecunia,”®^ from “ pecus,” “cattle.” At the present %0a%3c %0a%3c Four Roman feet in width, and 120 in length. %0a%3c %0a%3c Quartarius. %0a%3c %0a%3c “ Faha,” a bean ; “ Lens,” a lentil; and “ Cicer,” a chick-pea. %0a%3c %0a%3c A “ bubus,” from “ oxen.” Gains Junius Buhulcus was twiee Consul, %0a%3c and once Master of the Horse. %0a%3c %0a%3c 18 « Farreum” was a form of marriage, in which certain words were %0a%3c used, in presence of ten witne.sses, and were accompanied by a certain re¬ %0a%3c ligious ceremony, in which “ panis farreus” was employed ; hence this form %0a%3c of marriage was called “ confarreatio.” %0a%3c %0a%3c Farreum. %0a%3c %0a%3c 20 De Re Rust.

Fines, too, were only imposed in the %0a%3c shape of paying so many sheep or so many oxen; and the be¬ %0a%3c nevolent spirit of the ancient laws deserves remark, which %0a%3c most considerately enjoined that the magistrate, when he in¬ %0a%3c flicted a penalty, should never impose a fine of an ox before %0a%3c having first condemned the same party to the payment of a %0a%3c sheep. %0a%3c %0a%3c Those who celebrated the public games in honour of the ox %0a%3c received the name of Bubetii.** King Servius was the first %0a%3c who impressed upon our copper coin^ the figures of sheep and %0a%3c oxen. To depasture cattle secretly by night upon the unripe %0a%3c crops on plough lands, or to cut them in that state, was made %0a%3c by the Twelve Tables'^ a capital oflence in the case of an %0a%3c adult; and it was enacted that the person guilty of it should %0a%3c be hanged, in order to make due reparation to the goddess %0a%3c Ceres, a punishment more severe, even, than that inflicted for %0a%3c murder. If, on the other hand, the offender was not an adult, %0a%3c he was beaten at the discretion of the praetor; a penalty double %0a%3c the amount of the damage was also exacted. %0a%3c %0a%3c The various ranks, too, and distinctions in the state had no %0a%3c other origin than the pursuits of agriculture. The rural %0a%3c tribes held the foremost rank, and were composed of those %0a%3c who possessed lands ; while those of the city, a place to which %0a%3c it was looked upon as ignominious to be transferred, had the %0a%3c discredit thrown upon them of being an indolent race. Hence %0a%3c it was that these last were only four in number, and received %0a%3c their names from the several parts of the City which they re¬ %0a%3c spectively inhabited; being the Suburran, the Palatine, Col- %0a%3c line, and Exquiline tribes.

Manius Marcius, the aedile^® of the people, %0a%3c was the first who gave corn to the people at the price of one %0a%3c as for the mbdius. L. Minutius Augurinus,®' the same who %0a%3c detected, when.eleventh tribune of the people, the projects of %0a%3c Spurius Maelius, reduced the price of com on three market %0a%3c days,®* to one as per modius; for which reason a statue was %0a%3c erected in honour of him, by public subscription, without the %0a%3c Trigeminian Gate.®® T.

In the year,^ %0a%3c too, in which the Mother of the Gods was brought to Rome, the %0a%3c harvest of that summer, it is said, was more abundant than it %0a%3c had been for ten years before. M. Varro informs us, that in the %0a%3c year®® in which L. Metellus exhibited so many elephants in %0a%3c his triumphal procession, a modius of spelt was sold for one as, %0a%3c which was the standard price also of a congius of wine, thirty %0a%3c pounds’ weight of dried figs, ten pounds of olive oil, and %0a%3c twelve pounds of flesh meat. Nor did this cheapness originate %0a%3c in the wide-spread domains of individuals encroaching con¬ %0a%3c tinually upon their neighbours, for by a law proposed by Lici- %0a%3c nius Stolo, the landed property of each individual was limited %0a%3c to five hundred jugera; and he himself was convicted under %0a%3c his own law of being the owner of more than that amount, %0a%3c having as a disguise prevailed upon his sou to lend him his %0a%3c name. Such were the prices of commodities at a time when %0a%3c the fortunes of the republic were rapidly on the increase. The %0a%3c words, too, that were uttered by Manius Curius®^ after his %0a%3c triumphs and the addition of an immense extent of territory %0a%3c to the Roman sway, are well known: “ The man must be %0a%3c looked upon,” said he, “as a dangerous citizen, for whom %0a%3c seven jugera of land are not enough;” such being the amount %0a%3c of land that had been allotted to the people after the expulsion %0a%3c of the kings. %0a%3c %0a%3c What, then, was the cause of a fertility so remarkable as %0a%3c this ? The fact, we have every reason to believe, that in %0a%3c those days the lands were tilled by the hands of generals %0a%3c even, the soil exulting beneath a plough-share crowned with %0a%3c wreaths of laurel, and guided by a husbandman graced with %0a%3c triumphs: whether it is that they tended the seed with the %0a%3c same care that they had displayed in the conduct of wars, and %0a%3c manifested the same diligent attention in the management of %0a%3c their fields that they had done in the arrangement of the camp, %0a%3c %0a%3c A.u.c. 345. %0a%3c %0a%3c A.u.c. 550.

And whj’- should we not view in the light %0a%3c of oracles those precepts which have been tested by the infal¬ %0a%3c libility of time and the truthfulness of experience ? %0a%3c %0a%3c (5.) To make a beginning, then, with Cato'*®—“ The agricul¬ %0a%3c tural population,” says he, “ produces the bravest men, the %0a%3c most valiant soldiers,'*® and a class of citizens the least given of %0a%3c all to evil designs.—Do not be too eager in buying a farm.;— %0a%3c In rural operations never be sparing of your trouble, and, above %0a%3c all, when you are purchasing land.—A bad bargain is always %0a%3c a ground for repentance.—Those who are about to purchase %0a%3c land, should always have an eye more particularly to the water %0a%3c there, the roads, and the neighbourhood.” Each of these %0a%3c points is susceptible of a very extended explanation, and %0a%3c replete with undoubted truths. Cato^’ recommends, too, that %0a%3c an eye should be given to the people in the neighbourhood, to %0a%3c see how they look ; “ For where the land is good,” says he, %0a%3c “ the people will look well-conditioned and healthy.” %0a%3c %0a%3c Atilius Eegulus, the same who was twice consul in the %0a%3c Punic War, used to say^® that a person should neither buy an %0a%3c unhealthy piece of land in the most fertile locality, nor yet the %0a%3c very healthiest spot if in a barren country. The salubrity of %0a%3c land, however, is not always to be judged of from the looks of %0a%3c the inhabitants, for those who are well-seasoned are able to %0a%3c withstand the effects of living in pestilent localities even. And %0a%3c then, besides, there are some localities that are healthy during %0a%3c certain periods of the year only; though, in reality, there is %0a%3c no soil that can be looked upon as really valuable that is not %0a%3c healthy all the year through. “ That^® is sure to be bad land %0a%3c against which its owner has a continual struggle.” Cato %0a%3c recommends us before everjdhing, to see that the land which %0a%3c %0a%3c De Re Rust.

We %0a%3c should see, too, he says, that there is an abundance of manual %0a%3c labour in the neighbourhood, as well as a thriving town ; that %0a%3c there are either rivers or roads, to facilitate the carriage of the %0a%3c produce; that the buildings upon the land are substantially %0a%3c erected, and that the land itself bears every mark of having %0a%3c been carefully tilled—a point upon which I lind that many %0a%3c persons are greatly mistaken, as they are apt to imagine that %0a%3c the negligence of the previous owner is greatly to the pur¬ %0a%3c chaser’s advantage ; while the fact is, that there is nothing more %0a%3c expensive than the cultivation of a neglected soil. %0a%3c %0a%3c For this reason it is that Cato“ says that it is best to buy %0a%3c land of a careful proprietor, and that the methods adopted by %0a%3c others ought not to be hastily rejected—that it is the same %0a%3c with land as with mankind—however great the proceeds, if at %0a%3c the same time it is lavish and extravagant, there will be no %0a%3c great profits left. Cato looks upon a vineyard as the most” %0a%3c profitable investment; and he is far from wrong in that opi¬ %0a%3c nion, seeing that he takes such particular care to retrench all %0a%3c superfluous expenses. In the second rank he places gar¬ %0a%3c dens that have a good supply of water, and with good reason, %0a%3c too, supposing always that they are near a town. The ancients %0a%3c gave to meadow lands the name of “ parata,” or lands “ always %0a%3c ready.”®^ %0a%3c %0a%3c Cato being asked, on one occasion, what was the most cer¬ %0a%3c tain source of profit, “ Good pasture land,” was his answer; %0a%3c upon which, enquiry was made what was the next best. “Pretty %0a%3c good®® pasture lands,” said he—the amount of all which is, that %0a%3c he looked upon that as the most certain source of income %0a%3c which stands in need of the smallest outlay. This, however, %0a%3c will naturally vary in degree, according to the nature of the %0a%3c respective localities; and the same is the case with the maxim” %0a%3c to which he gives utterance, that a good agriculturist must be %0a%3c %0a%3c s*’ De Ee Eust. c. 1. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is still thought so in France, Fee says, and nothing has tended %0a%3c more than this notion to the depreciation of the prices of wine. %0a%3c %0a%3c =* Hence the usual Latin name, “ prata.” %0a%3c %0a%3c 53 “ Si sat hene.” Cicero, De Officiis, B. ii. n. 88, gives this anecdote %0a%3c somewhat more at length. %0a%3c %0a%3c 51 De Ee Eust. c. 2. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 7.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c AEBANGEMENTS FOE A FAEM-HOTJSE. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 13 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c fond of selling.

(6.)- THE PROPEE ARRANGEMENTS FOR A FARM-HOUSE. %0a%3c %0a%3c The proper plan to be pursued is this: ®’ the farm-house must %0a%3c not be unsuitable for the farm, nor the farm for the house; and %0a%3c we must be on our guard against following the examples of L. %0a%3c Lucullus and Q. Scaevola, who, though living in the same age, %0a%3c fell into the two opposite extremes; for whereas the farm-house %0a%3c of Scaevola was not large enough for the produce of his farm, %0a%3c the farm of Lucullus was not sufficiently large for the house he %0a%3c built upon it; an error which gave occasion to the reproof of %0a%3c the censors, that on his farm there was less of ground for %0a%3c ploughing than of floor for sweeping. The proper arrange¬ %0a%3c ments for a farm-house are not to be made without a certain %0a%3c degree of skill. C.

Although, when speaking®* of %0a%3c the best kinds of soil, I may seem to have sufficiently discussed %0a%3c the characteristics by which it may be known, I shall take the %0a%3c present opportunity of adding a few more indications, employ¬ %0a%3c ing the words of Cato®® more particularly for the purpose. %0a%3c “ The dwarf-elder,” says he, “the wild plum,®^ the bramble, %0a%3c the small bulb,®® trefoil, meadow grass,®® the quercus, and the %0a%3c wild pear and wild apple, are all of them indicative of a com %0a%3c land. The same is the case, too, where the land is black, or %0a%3c of an ashy colour. All chalky soils are scorching, unless they %0a%3c are very thin ; the same, too, with sand, unless it is remarkably %0a%3c fine. These remarks, however, are more applicable to cham¬ %0a%3c paign localities than declivities.” %0a%3c %0a%3c The ancients were of opinion, that before everything, mode¬ %0a%3c ration should be observed in the extent of a farm; for it was %0a%3c a favourite maxim of theirs, that we ought to sow the less, and %0a%3c plough the more : such too, I find, was the opinion entertained %0a%3c by Virgil,®^ and indeed, if we must confess the truth, it is the %0a%3c wide-spread" domains that have been the ruin®® of Italy, and %0a%3c soon will be that of the provinces as well.

With that great¬ %0a%3c ness of mind which was so peculiarly his own, and of wliich %0a%3c he ought not to lose the credit, Cneius Pompeius would never %0a%3c pufchase the lands that belonged to a neighbour. Mago has %0a%3c stated it as his opinion, that a person, on buying a farm, ought %0a%3c at once to sell his town house an opinion, however, which %0a%3c savours of too great rigidity, and is by no means conformable to %0a%3c the public good. It is with these words, indeed, that he begins %0a%3c his precepts; a good proof, at all events, that he looks upon the %0a%3c personal inspection of the owner as of primary importance. %0a%3c %0a%3c The next point which requires our care is to employ a farm- %0a%3c steward’’^^ of experience, and upon this, too, Cato'”^ has given %0a%3c many useful precepts. Still, however, it must suffice for %0a%3c me to say that the steward ought to be a man nearly as clever %0a%3c as his master, though without appearing to know it. It is the %0a%3c very worst plan of all, to have land tilled by slaves let loose %0a%3c from the houses of correction, as, indeed, is the case with all %0a%3c work entrusted to men who live without hope. I may possibly %0a%3c appear guilty of some degree of rashness in making mention of %0a%3c a maxim of the ancients, which will very probably be looked %0a%3c upon as quite incredible—“ That nothing is so disadvantageous %0a%3c as to cultivate land in the highest style of perfection.” L. %0a%3c Tarius Rufus, a man who, bom in the very lowest ranks of %0a%3c life, by his military talents finally attained the consulship,’® %0a%3c and who in other respects adhered to the old-fashioned notions %0a%3c of thriftiness, made away with about one hundred millions of %0a%3c sesterces, which, by the liberality of the late Emperor Augus¬ %0a%3c tus, he had contrived to amass, in buying up lands in Picenum, %0a%3c and cultivating them in the highest style, his object being to %0a%3c gain a name thereby ; the consequence of which was, that his %0a%3c heir renounced’’^ the inheritance. Are we of opinion, then, %0a%3c that ruin and starvation must be the necessary consequence of %0a%3c such a course as this? Yes, by Hercules ! and the very best %0a%3c plan of all is to let moderation guide our judgment in all things. %0a%3c To cultivate land well is absolutely necessary, but to cultivate %0a%3c %0a%3c And reside on the farm. %0a%3c %0a%3c Villicus. %0a%3c %0a%3c De Re Rust. c. 5. %0a%3c %0a%3c A.u.c. 737. %0a%3c %0a%3c Probably because it entailed too great an expense.

C. Furius ChresiH^us, a freedman, having found him¬ %0a%3c self able, from a very small piece of land, to raise far more %0a%3c abundant harvests than his neighbours could from the largest %0a%3c farms, became the object of very considerable jealousy among %0a%3c them, and was accordingly accused of enticing away the crops %0a%3c of others by the practice of sorcery. Upon this, a day was %0a%3c named by Spurius Calvinus, the curule aedile, for his appear¬ %0a%3c ance. Apprehensive of being condemned, when the question %0a%3c came to be put to the vote among the tribes, he had all his %0a%3c implements of husbandry brought into the Forum, together %0a%3c with his farm servants, robust, well-conditioned, and well-clad %0a%3c people, Piso says. The iron tools were of first-rate quality, %0a%3c the mattocks were stout and strong, the plough-shares ponde¬ %0a%3c rous and substantial, and the oxen sleek and in prime condi¬ %0a%3c tion. When all this had been done, “ Here, Koman citi¬ %0a%3c zens,” said he, “ are my implements of magic; but it is impos¬ %0a%3c sible for me to exhibit to your view, or to bring into this %0a%3c Forum, those midnight toils of mine, those early watchings, %0a%3c those sweats, and those fatigues.” Upon this, by the unani¬ %0a%3c mous voice of the people, he was immediately acquitted. %0a%3c Agriculture, in fact, depends upon the expenditure of labour %0a%3c and exertion; and hence it is that the ancients were in the %0a%3c habit of saying, that it is the eye of the master that does more %0a%3c towards fertilizing a field than anything else. %0a%3c %0a%3c We shall give the rest of these precepts in their appropriate %0a%3c places, according as we find them adapted to each variety of %0a%3c cultivation ; but in the meantime we must not omit some of a %0a%3c general nature, which here recur to our recollection, and more %0a%3c %0a%3c Virgil, Georg. I. 268, et seq., speaks of the work that might be done %0a%3c on feast days—making hedges, for instance, irrigating land, catching %0a%3c birds, washing sheep, and burning weeds. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 18 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c PLINY’s natural UlSTOBT. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XVIII. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c particularly that maxim of Cato, as profitable as it is humane: %0a%3c “ Always act in such away as to secure the love of your neigh¬ %0a%3c bours.” He then proceeds to state his reasons for giving this %0a%3c advice, but it appears to me that no one surely can entertain %0a%3c the slightest doubt upon the subject. One of the very first %0a%3c recommendations that he gives is to take every care that the %0a%3c farm servants are kept in good condition.'* It is a maxim %0a%3c universally agreed upon in agriculture, that nothing must be %0a%3c done too late ; and again, that everything must be done at its %0a%3c proper season; while there is a third precept, which reminds %0a%3c us that opportunities lost can never be regained. The male¬ %0a%3c diction uttered by Cato against rotten ground has been treated %0a%3c of at some length already ;®* but there is another precept which %0a%3c he is never tired of repeating, “ Whatever can be done by the %0a%3c help of the ass, will cost the least money.” %0a%3c %0a%3c Tern will be sure to die at the end of a couple of years, if %0a%3c you prevent it from putting forth leaves ; the most efficient me¬ %0a%3c thod of ensuring this is to beat the branches with a stick while %0a%3c they are in bud ; for then the juices that drop from it will kill %0a%3c the roots.It is said, too, that fern will not spring up again %0a%3c if it is pulled up by the roots about the turn of the summer %0a%3c solstice, or if the stalks are cut with the edge of a reed, or if it %0a%3c is turned up with a plough-share with a reed placed** upon it. %0a%3c In the same way, too, we are told that reeds maybe effectually %0a%3c ploughed up, if care is taken to place a stalk of fern upon the %0a%3c share. A field infested with rushes should be turned up with %0a%3c the spade, or, if the locality is stony, with a two-pronged %0a%3c mattock : overgrown shrubs are best removed by fire. Where %0a%3c ground is too moist, it is an advantageous plan to cut trenches %0a%3c in it and so drain it; where the soil is cretaceous, these trenches %0a%3c should be left open; and where it is loose, they should be %0a%3c strengthened with a hedge to prevent them from falling in. %0a%3c When these drains are made on a declivity, they should have %0a%3c a layer of gutter tiles at the bottom, or else house tiles with the %0a%3c face upwards : in some cases, too, they should be covered” %0a%3c %0a%3c 79 familiae male sit.” so Jn B. xvii. c. 3. %0a%3c %0a%3c SI The Pteris aquilina, or female fern.

The dififereuce %0a%3c between these two classes is too well known to require any %0a%3c further description. ' %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c CH.AP. 10.-THE HISTORY OF THE VARIOUS KINDS OF GRAIN. %0a%3c %0a%3c The cereals are divided again into the same number of %0a%3c varieties, according to the time of the year at which they %0a%3c are sown. The winter grains are those which are put in %0a%3c the ground about the setting of the Vergiliae,®® and there re¬ %0a%3c ceive their nutriment throughout the winter, for instance, %0a%3c wheat,®’' spelt,®® and barley.®* The summer grains are those %0a%3c which are sown in summer, before the rising of the Vergiliae,®" %0a%3c %0a%3c The flower of the lupine could not possibly produce any such effect; %0a%3c and the juice of cicuta, or hemlock, in only a very trifling degree. %0a%3c %0a%3c This word answers to the Latin “ frumenta,” which indicates all those %0a%3c kinds of corn from which bread was prepared by the ancients. %0a%3c %0a%3c See c. 59 of this book. %0a%3c %0a%3c Triticum hibernum of Linnaeus, similar to the “siligo” mentioned in %0a%3c the sequel.

It consists of two varie¬ %0a%3c ties, the single grained, the Triticum monococcum of Linnaeus, and the %0a%3c double-grained, the Triticum spelta of Linnteus, which is still called “ farra* %0a%3c in Friuli. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hordeum sativum of Linnaeus. %0a%3c %0a%3c See c. 66 of this Book. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 20 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Pliny’s natueal histoet. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XVIII. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c such as millet,®^ panic,®* sesame,®* horminum,®* and irio,®* in %0a%3c accordance, however, with the usage of Italy only; for in %0a%3c Greece and Asia all the grains are sown just after the setting of %0a%3c the Vergilia 3 . There are some, again, that are sown at either %0a%3c season in Italy, and others at a third period, or, in other %0a%3c words, in the spring. Some authors give the name of spring- %0a%3c grain to millet, panic, lentils,®® chick-peas,®* and alica,®* %0a%3c while they call wheat, barley, beans, turnips, and rape, semen- %0a%3c tive or early sowing seeds. Certain species of wheat are only %0a%3c sown to make fodder for cattle, and are known by the name of %0a%3c “ farrago,”®® or mixed grain; the same, too, with the legumi¬ %0a%3c nous plants, the vetch, for instance. The lupine,* however, is %0a%3c grown in common as food for both cattle and men. %0a%3c %0a%3c All the leguminous* plants, with the exception of the bean, %0a%3c have a single root, hard and tough, like wood, and destitute of %0a%3c numerous ramifications; the chick-pea has the deepest root of %0a%3c all. Corn has numerous fibrous roots, but no ramifications. %0a%3c Barley makes its appearance* above ground the seventh day %0a%3c after sowing; the leguminous plants on the fourth, or at the %0a%3c very latest, the seventh; the bean from the fifteenth day to %0a%3c the twentieth: though in Egypt the leguminous plants appear %0a%3c as early as the third day after they are sown. In barley, one %0a%3c extremity of the grain throws out the root, and the other the %0a%3c %0a%3c Pauicum Italicum of Linnaeus. %0a%3c %0a%3c Panicum miliaceum of Linnaeus.

In the %0a%3c cereals in general it is the thicker end of the seed that throws %0a%3c out the root, the thinner end the blossom; while in the other %0a%3c seeds both root and blossom issue from the same part. %0a%3c %0a%3c During the winter, corn is in the blade; hut in the spring %0a%3c winter corn throws out a tall stem. As for millet and panic, %0a%3c they grow Avith a jointed and grooved^ stalk, while sesame has %0a%3c a steui resembling that of fennel-giant. The fruit of all these %0a%3c seeds is either contained in an ear, as in wheat and barley, for %0a%3c instance, and protected from the attacks of birds and small %0a%3c animals by a prickly beard bristling like so many palisades; or %0a%3c else it is enclosed in pods, as in the leguminous plants, or in %0a%3c capsules, as in sesame and the poppy. Millet and panic can %0a%3c only be said to belong to the grower and the small birds in %0a%3c common, as they have nothing but a thin membrane to cover %0a%3c them, without the slightest protection. Panic receives that %0a%3c name from the panicule® or down that is to be seen upon it; %0a%3c the head of it droops languidly, and the stalk tapers gra¬ %0a%3c dually in thickness, being of almost the toughness and con¬ %0a%3c sistency of wood : the head is loaded with grain closely packed, %0a%3c there being a tuft upon the top, nearly a foot in length. In %0a%3c millet the husks which embrace the grain bend downward with %0a%3c a wavy tuft upon the edge. There are several varieties of %0a%3c panic, the mammose, for instance, the ears of which are in %0a%3c clusters with small edgings of down, the head of the plant %0a%3c being double ; it is distinguished also according to the colour, %0a%3c the white, for instance, the black, the red, and the purple %0a%3c even.

Wheat, however, has four^° articula¬ %0a%3c tions, spelt^^ six, and barley eight. In the case of these last, %0a%3c the ear does not begin to form before the number of joints, as %0a%3c above mentioned, is complete. Within four or five days, at %0a%3c the very latest, after the ear has given signs of forming, the %0a%3c plant begins to flower, and in the course of as many days or a %0a%3c little more, sheds its blossom : barley blossoms at the end of %0a%3c seven days at the very latest. Varro says that the grains are %0a%3c perfectly formed at the end of four times^^ nine days from their %0a%3c dowering, and are ready for cutting at the ninth month. %0a%3c %0a%3c The bean, again, first appears in leaf, and then throws out %0a%3c a stalk, which has no articulations*® upon it.

The bean and the lupine are the only %0a%3c ones among the leguminous plants that have a single stem; in %0a%3c all the others the stem throws out branches, being of a lig¬ %0a%3c neous nature, very thin, and in all cases hollow.

In the %0a%3c ervilia^® and the pea the leaf is long,'® in the kidney-bean %0a%3c veined, and in sesame'’ and irio the colour of blood. The %0a%3c lupine and the poppy are the only ones among these plants that %0a%3c lose'® their leaves. %0a%3c %0a%3c The leguminous plants remain a longer time in flower, the %0a%3c fitch and the chick-pea more particularly ; but the bean is in %0a%3c blossom the longest of them all, for the flower remains on it %0a%3c forty days; not, indeed, that each stalk retains its blossom %0a%3c for aU that length of time, but, as the flower goes off in %0a%3c one, it comes on in another. In the bean, too, the crop is not %0a%3c npe all at once, as is the case with corn ; for the pods make %0a%3c their appearance at different times, at the lowest parts first, %0a%3c the blossom mounting upwards by degrees. %0a%3c %0a%3c When the blossom is off in corn, the stalk gradually thickens, %0a%3c and it ripens within forty days at the most. The same is the %0a%3c case, too, with the bean, but the chick-pea takes a much shorter %0a%3c time to ripen ; indeed, it is fit for gathering within forty days %0a%3c from the time that it is sown. Millet, panic, sesame, and all the %0a%3c summer grains are ripe within forty days after blossoming, %0a%3c with considerable variations, of course, in reference to soil and %0a%3c weather. Thus, in Egypt, we find barley cut at the end of %0a%3c six months, and wheat at the end of seven, from the time of %0a%3c sowing. In Hellas, again, barley is cut in the seventh month, %0a%3c and in Peloponnesus in the eighth ; the wheat being got in at %0a%3c a still later period. %0a%3c %0a%3c Those grains which grow on a stalk of straw are enclosed %0a%3c in an envelope protected bj'^ a prickly beard; while in the bean %0a%3c and the leguminous plants in general they are enclosed in pods %0a%3c upon branches which shoot alternately from either side.

The Gauls have %0a%3c also a kind of spelt peculiar to that country: they give it the %0a%3c name of “ brace,”®® while to us it is known as “sandala:” it %0a%3c has a grain of remarkable whiteness. Another difference, %0a%3c again, is the fact that it yields nearly four pounds more of %0a%3c bread to the modius than any other kind of spelt.

Among these the %0a%3c wheat of Boeotia'® occupies the fii’st rank, that of Sicily the %0a%3c second, and that of Africa the third. The wheats of Thrace, %0a%3c Syria, and, more recently, of Egypt, used to hold the third rank %0a%3c for weight, these facts having been ascertained through the %0a%3c medium of the athletes; whose powers of consumption, equal %0a%3c to those of beasts of burden, have established the gradations in %0a%3c weight, as already stated. Greece, too, held the Pontic^® wheat %0a%3c in high esteem ; but this has not reached Italy as yet. Of %0a%3c all the varieties of grain, however, the Greeks gave the pre¬ %0a%3c ference to the kinds called dracontion, strangia, and Selinusium, %0a%3c the chief characteristic of which is a stem of remarkable thick¬ %0a%3c ness : it was this, in the opinion of the Greeks, that marked %0a%3c them as the peculiar growth of a rich soil. On the other hand, %0a%3c thoj'^ recommended for sowing in humid soils an extremely %0a%3c light and diminutive species of grain, with a remarkably thin %0a%3c stalk, known to them as speudias, and standing in need of an %0a%3c abundance of nutriment. Such, at all events, were the opi¬ %0a%3c nions generally entertained in the reign of Alexander the Great,, %0a%3c at a time when Greece was at the height of her glory, and the %0a%3c most powerful country in the world. Still, however, nearly %0a%3c one hundred and forty-four years before the death of that %0a%3c prince we find the poet Sophocles, in his Tragedy of “ Trip- %0a%3c tolemus,” praising the corn of Italy before all others. The %0a%3c passage, translated word for word, is to the following effect: %0a%3c %0a%3c “And favour’d Italy grows white with hoary wheat.’’ %0a%3c %0a%3c I %0a%3c %0a%3c And it is this whiteness that is still one of the peculiar merits %0a%3c of the Italian wheat; a circumstance which makes me the more %0a%3c surprised to find that none of the Greek writers of a later %0a%3c period have made any reference to it. %0a%3c %0a%3c 28 From Theophrastus, De Causis, B. iv. %0a%3c %0a%3c 29 That of the Ukraine and its vicinity, which is still held in high esteem. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 26 pltnt’s natubal histobt. [Book XVIIL %0a%3c %0a%3c Of the various kinds of wheat which are imported at the %0a%3c present day into Rome, the lightest in weight are those which %0a%3c come from Gaul and Chersonnesus ; for, upon weighing them, %0a%3c it will be found that they do not yield more than twenty %0a%3c pounds to the modius. The grain of Sardinia weighs half a %0a%3c pound more, and that of Alexandria one-third of a pound more %0a%3c than that of Sardinia; the Sicilian wheat is the same iu %0a%3c weight as the Alexandrian. The Boeotian wheat, again, weighs %0a%3c a whole pound more than these last, and that of Africa a pound %0a%3c and three quarters. In Italy beyond the Padus, the spelt, to %0a%3c my knowledge, weighs twenty-five pounds to the modius, and, %0a%3c in the vicinity of Clusium, six-and-twenty. AVe find it a %0a%3c rule, universally established by Nature, that in every kind of %0a%3c commissariat bread®® that is made, the bread exceeds the weight %0a%3c of the grain by one-third; and in the same way it is generally %0a%3c considered that that is the best kind of wheat, which, in %0a%3c kneading, will absorb one congius of water.®^ There are some %0a%3c kinds of wheat which give, when used by themselves, an ad¬ %0a%3c ditional weight equal to this; the Balearic wheat, for instance, %0a%3c which to a modius of grain yields thirty-five pounds weight of %0a%3c bread. Others, again, will only give this additional weight %0a%3c by being mixed with other kinds, the Cj'prian wheat and the %0a%3c Alexandrian, for example; which, if used by themselves, will %0a%3c yield no more than twenty pounds to the modius. The wheat %0a%3c of Cyprus is swarthy, and produces a dark bread; for which %0a%3c reason it is generally mixed with the white wheat of Alexan¬ %0a%3c dria; the mixture yielding twenty-five pounds of bread to the %0a%3c modius of grain. The wheat of Thebais, in Egypt, Avhen %0a%3c made into bread, yields twenty-six pounds to the modius. To %0a%3c knead the meal with sea-water, as is mostly done in the mari¬ %0a%3c time districts, for the purpose of saving the salt, is extremely %0a%3c pernicious; there is nothing, in fact, that will more readily %0a%3c predispose the human body to disease. In Gaul and Spain, %0a%3c where they make a drink®® by steeping corn in the way that %0a%3c has been already described—they employ the foam®® which %0a%3c thickens upon the surface as a leaven: hence it is that %0a%3c the bread in those countries is lighter than that made else¬ %0a%3c where. %0a%3c %0a%3c 3® Panis iiiilitaris 3i To the modius of wheat. %0a%3c %0a%3c 33 lie alludes to beer, or sweet-wort.

In Thrace, the stem of %0a%3c the wheat is covered with several coats,^* which are rendered %0a%3c absolutely necessary by the excessive cold of those regions. %0a%3c It is the cold, also, that led to the discovery there of the three- %0a%3c month’® wheat, the ground being covered with snow most %0a%3c ot the year. At the end mostly of three months after it has %0a%3c been sown, this wheat is ready for cutting, both in Thrace and %0a%3c in other parts of the world as well. This variety is well known, %0a%3c too, throughout all the Alpine range, and in the northern pro¬ %0a%3c vinces there is no kind of wheat that is more prolific ; it has %0a%3c a single stem only, is by no means of large size in any part of %0a%3c it, and is never sown but in a thin, light soil. There is a two- %0a%3c month’® wheat also found in the vicinity of .^Enos, in Thrace, %0a%3c w'hich ripens the fortieth day after sowing; and yet it is a %0a%3c surprising fact, that there is no kind of wheat that weighs %0a%3c heavier than this, while at the same time it produces no bran. %0a%3c Both Sicily and Achaia grow it, in the mountainous districts %0a%3c of those countries ; as also Euboea, in the vicinity of Carystus. %0a%3c So greatly, then, is Columella in error,in supposing that %0a%3c there is no distinct variety of three-month wheat even; the %0a%3c fact being that these varieties have been known from the very %0a%3c earliest times.

The kinds most universally grown are spelt, by the %0a%3c ancients known as “ adorea,” winter wheat,®‘ and wheat;®® all %0a%3c these being common to many countries. Arinca was originally %0a%3c peculiar to Gaul, though now it is widely diffused over Italy %0a%3c as well. Egypt, too, Syria, Cilicia, Asia, and Greece, have their %0a%3c own peculiar kinds, known by the names of zea,®® olyra, and %0a%3c tiphe.®' In Egypt, they make a fine flour from wheat of their %0a%3c own growth, but it is by no means equal to that of Italy. %0a%3c Those countries which employ zea, have no spelt. Zea, how¬ %0a%3c ever, is to be found in Italy, and in Campania more particularly, %0a%3c where it is known by the name of “ seed.”®® The grain that %0a%3c bears this name enjoys a very considerable celebrity, as we %0a%3c shall have occasion to state®® on another occasion ; and it is in %0a%3c honour of this that Homer’® uses the expression, ^sidupog %0a%3c apovpa, and not, as some suppose, from the fact of the earth %0a%3c giving life.” Amylum is made, too, from this grain, but of a %0a%3c %0a%3c Nova Cartliago, or New Carthage. %0a%3c %0a%3c Tills fallacious opinion is shared with Galen, De Facult.

Winter wheat furnishes bread of the very finest quality %0a%3c and the most esteemed delicacies of the bakers. The best %0a%3c bread that is known in Italy is made from a mixture of Cam¬ %0a%3c panian winter wheat with that of Pisae. The Campanian kind %0a%3c is of a redder colour, while the latter is white; when mixed %0a%3c with chalk,®® it is increased in weight. The proper proportion %0a%3c for the yield of Campanian wheat to the modiiis of grain is %0a%3c four sextarii of what is known as bolted fiour;®^ but when it %0a%3c is used in the rough and has not been bolted, then the yield %0a%3c should be five sextarii of flour. In addition to this, in either %0a%3c case there should be half a modius of Avhite meal, with four %0a%3c sextarii of coarse meal, known as “ seconds,” and the same %0a%3c quantity of bran.®® The Pisan Avheat produces five sextarii of %0a%3c fine flour to the modius; in other respects it yields the same %0a%3c as that of Campania. The wheat of Clusium and Arretium %0a%3c gives another sextarius of fine flour, but the' yield is similar to %0a%3c that of the kinds already mentioned in all other respects. %0a%3c If, however, as much of it as possible is converted into fine %0a%3c wheat meal, the modius will yield sixteen pounds weight of %0a%3c white bread, and three of seconds, with half a modius of bran. %0a%3c These differences, however’, depend very materially upon the %0a%3c grinding; for when the grain is ground quite dry it produces %0a%3c more meal, but when sprinkled with salt water®® a whiter %0a%3c flour, though at the same time a greater quantity of bran. It %0a%3c is ver}' evident that “ farina,” the name we give to meal, is %0a%3c derived from “ far.” A modius of meal made from Gallic winter %0a%3c %0a%3c In other places he says, most unaccountably, that wheat “degenerates %0a%3c into siligo.” %0a%3c %0a%3c As to this practice, see c. 29, %0a%3c %0a%3c “ Quam vocant castratam.” %0a%3c %0a%3c From this aceount, it would appear that there were twenty-four sex¬ %0a%3c tarii to the modius; but the account in general is very contradictory. %0a%3c %0a%3c Salt water is rarely used for this purpose in modern times. See %0a%3c this passage discussed in Beckmann on Inventions, Bohn’s Ed. vol. i. p. %0a%3c 164. %0a%3c %0a%3c VOL.

When the bread is baked in the oven,®® two %0a%3c pounds must be added in weight in either case. %0a%3c %0a%3c (10.) Wheat yields a fine flour®® of the very highest quality. %0a%3c In African wheat the modius ought to yield halt a modius of %0a%3c fine flour and five sextarii of pollen, that being the name %0a%3c given to fine wheat meal, in the same way that that of winter %0a%3c wheat is generally known as “ flos,” or the “ flower.” This %0a%3c fine meal is extensively used in copper works and paper manu¬ %0a%3c factories. In addition to the above, the modius should yield %0a%3c four sextarii of coarse meal, and the same quantity of bran. %0a%3c The finest wheaten flour will yield one hundred®® and twenty- %0a%3c two pounds of bread, and the fine meal of winter wheat one %0a%3c hundred®® and seventeen, to the modius of grain. When the %0a%3c prices of grain are moderate, meal sells at forty asses the mo¬ %0a%3c dius, bolted wheaten flour at eight asses more, and bolted %0a%3c flour of winter wheat, at sixteen asses more. There is another %0a%3c distinction again in fine wheaten flour, which originated for¬ %0a%3c merly in the days of L. Paulus. There were three classes of %0a%3c wheat; the first of which would appear to have yielded seven¬ %0a%3c teen pounds of bread, the second eighteen, and the third nine¬ %0a%3c teen pounds and a third : to these were added two pounds and %0a%3c a half of seconds,®^ and the same quantity of brown®^ bread, %0a%3c with six sextarii of bran.®® %0a%3c %0a%3c Winter wheat never ripens all at once, and yet there is none %0a%3c of the cereals that can so ill brook any delay; it being of so %0a%3c delicate a nature, that the ears directly they are ripe will begin %0a%3c to shed their grain. So long, however, as it is in stalk, it is %0a%3c exposed to fewer risks than other kinds of wheat, from the fact %0a%3c %0a%3c “ Artopticio.” See c. 27 of this Book, %0a%3c %0a%3c Without tin, probably; or the tin bread may have been baked %0a%3c before tlie fire, similar to the method adopted at the present day avith the %0a%3c American ovens. %0a%3c %0a%3c “ Similago.” Founders still use meal occasionally for making moulds; %0a%3c it is also employed in making paper. %0a%3c %0a%3c The mention of “ hundreds” here is evidently faulty, unless the other %0a%3c part of the passage is corrupt. Fee suggests twenty-two and twenty seven. %0a%3c %0a%3c But above we find him .stating that “secundarius,” “seconds” %0a%3c flour, and “cibarius,” or “coarse,” meal, are the same thing. His con¬ %0a%3c tradictions cannot apparently be reconciled. %0a%3c %0a%3c **2 The -whole of this passage, as Brotier remarks, is evidently corrupt. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 21.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c WHEAT IN AFBICA. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 35 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c of its always having the ear upright, and not retaining the %0a%3c dew, which is a prolific cause of mildew. %0a%3c %0a%3c From arinca®^ a bread of remarkable sweetness is made. %0a%3c The grains in this variety lie closer than they do in spelt; the %0a%3c ear, too, is larger and more weighty.

In this instrument the iron is %0a%3c notched” at the bottom, sharp ridges running out like the %0a%3c edge of a knife, and concentrating in the form of a star; so %0a%3c that if care is not taken to hold the pestle perpendicularly %0a%3c while pounding, the grains will only be splintered and the iron %0a%3c teeth broken. Throughout the greater part of Italy, however, %0a%3c they employ a pestle that is only rough” at the end, and %0a%3c wheels turned by water, by means of which the corn is gra¬ %0a%3c dually ground. I shall here set forth the opinions given by %0a%3c Mago as to the best method of pounding corn. He says that %0a%3c the wheat should be steeped first of all in water, and then %0a%3c cleaned from the husk; after which it should be dried in the %0a%3c sun, and then pounded with the pestle; the same plan, he %0a%3c says, should be adopted in the preparation of barley. In the %0a%3c latter case, however, twenty sextarii of grain require only two %0a%3c sextarii of water. When lentils are used, they should be first %0a%3c parched, and then lightly pounded with the bran; or els.e, %0a%3c adopting another method, a piece of unbaked brick and half a %0a%3c modius of sand ” should be added to eveiy twenty sextarii of %0a%3c lentils. %0a%3c %0a%3c Ervilia should be treated in the same way as lentils. Sesame %0a%3c should be first steeped in warm water, and then laid out to %0a%3c dry, after which it should be rubbed out briskly, and then %0a%3c thrown into cold water, so that the chaff maj* be disengaged %0a%3c by floating to the surface. After this is done, the grain should %0a%3c again be spread out in the sun, upon linen cloths, to dry. Care, %0a%3c however, should be taken to lose no time in doing this, as it is %0a%3c apt to turn musty, and assume a dull, livid colour. The grains, %0a%3c too, which are just cleaned from the husk, require various %0a%3c methods of pounding. When the beard is ground by itself, %0a%3c without the grain, the result is known as “ acus,”” but it is %0a%3c only used by goldsmiths.” If, on the other hand, it is beaten %0a%3c %0a%3c This would rather grate the grain than found it, as Beckmann ob- %0a%3c Berves.

The nations of Sarmatia live principally on this %0a%3c porridge, and even the raw meal, with the sole addition of %0a%3c mares’ milk, or else blood ” extracted from the thigh of the %0a%3c horse. The .Ethiopians know of no other grain but millet and %0a%3c barley. %0a%3c %0a%3c ' CHAP. 25. -PANIC. %0a%3c %0a%3c The people of Gaul, and of Aquitania more particularly, %0a%3c make use of panic; the same is the case, too, in Italy beyond %0a%3c the Padus, with the addition, however, of the bean, without %0a%3c which they prepare none of their food. There is no aliment %0a%3c held in higher esteem than panic by the nations of Pontus. %0a%3c The other summer grains thrive better in well-watered soils %0a%3c than in rainy localities ; but water is by no means beneficial %0a%3c to millet or panic when they are coming into blade. It is re¬ %0a%3c commended not to sow them among vines or fruit-trees, as it %0a%3c is generally thought that these crops impoverish the soil. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 26. (11) —THE VABIOHS KINDS OF LEAVEN. %0a%3c %0a%3c Millet is more particularly employed for making leaven; and %0a%3c if kneaded with must,^® it wuU keep a whole year. The same %0a%3c is done, too, with the fine wheat-bran of the best quality; it %0a%3c is kneaded with white must three days old, and then dried in %0a%3c the sun, after which it is made into small cakes. When re¬ %0a%3c quired for making bread, these cakes are first soaked in water. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Tartars still employ millet as one of their principal articles of %0a%3c food. They also extract a kind of wine from it. %0a%3c %0a%3c 1’ Virgil alludes to this, Georg, iii. 463. %0a%3c %0a%3c Panic is still employed more than any other grain in the south of %0a%3c France. %0a%3c %0a%3c 19 Or grape-juice. _ This must have tended to affect the taste of the %0a%3c bread. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 27.] THE METHOD OF MAKING BEEAD. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 39 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c and then boiled with the finest spelt flour, after which the whole %0a%3c is mixed up with the meal; and it is generally thought that %0a%3c this is the best method of making bread. The Greeks have %0a%3c established a rule that for a modius of meal eight ounces of %0a%3c leaven is enough. %0a%3c %0a%3c These kinds of leaven, however, can only be made at the %0a%3c time of vintage, but there is another leaven which may be pre¬ %0a%3c pared with barley and water, at any time it may happen to be %0a%3c required. It is first made up into cakes of two pounds in %0a%3c weight, and these are then baked upon a hot hearth, or else in %0a%3c an earthen dish upon hot ashes and charcoal, being left till %0a%3c they turn of a reddish brown. When this is done, the cakes %0a%3c are shut close in vessels, until they turn quite sour: Avhen %0a%3c wanted for leaven, they are steeped in water first. When %0a%3c barley bread used to be made, it was leavened with the meal %0a%3c of the fitch,or else the chicheling vetch,the proportion %0a%3c being, two pounds of leaven to two modii and a half of barley %0a%3c meal. At the present day, however, the leaven is prepared %0a%3c from the meal that is used for making the bread. For this %0a%3c purpose, some of the meal is kneaded before adding the salt, %0a%3c and is then boiled to the consistency of porridge, and left till %0a%3c it begins to turn sour. In most cases, however, they do not %0a%3c warm it at all, but only make use of a little of the dough that %0a%3c has been kept from the day before. It is very evident that the %0a%3c principle which causes the dough to rise is of an acid nature, %0a%3c and it is equally evident that those persons who are dieted %0a%3c upon fermented bread are stronger*^ in body. Among the %0a%3c ancients, too, it was generally thought that the heavier wheat %0a%3c is, the more wholesome it is. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 27 . —THE METHOD OF MAKING BREAD : ORIGIN OP THE ART. %0a%3c %0a%3c It seems to me quite unnecessary to enter into an account %0a%3c of the various kinds of bread that are made. Some kinds, we %0a%3c find, receive their names from the dishes with which they are %0a%3c eaten, the oyster-bread,-^ for instance: others, again, from %0a%3c their peculiar delicacy, the artolaganus,^^ or cake-bread, for %0a%3c example; and others from the expedition with wliich they are %0a%3c %0a%3c Ervum, ** “ Cicercula."

The excellence %0a%3c of the finest kinds of bread depends principally on the goodness %0a%3c of the wheat, and the fineness of the bolter. Some persons %0a%3c knead the dough with eggs or milk, and butter even has been %0a%3c employed for the purpose by nations that have had leisure to %0a%3c cultivate the arts of peace, and to give their attention to the %0a%3c art of making pastry. Picenum still maintains its ancient %0a%3c reputation for making the bread which it was the first to in¬ %0a%3c vent, alica®® being the grain emploj^ed. The flour is kept in %0a%3c soak for nine days, and is kneade^ on the tenth with raisin %0a%3c juice, in the shape of long rolls; after which it is baked in an %0a%3c oven in earthen pots, till they break. This bread, however, is %0a%3c never eaten till it has been well®^ soaked, which is mostly done %0a%3c in milk mixed with honey. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 28. -WHEN BAKERS WERE FIRST INTRODUCED AT ROME. %0a%3c %0a%3c There were no bakers at Pome until the war with King %0a%3c Perseus, more than five hundred and eighty years after the %0a%3c building of the City. The ancient Pomans used to make their %0a%3c own bread, it being an occupation which belonged to the wo¬ %0a%3c men, as we see the case in many nations even at the present %0a%3c day. Plautus speaks of the artopta, or bread-tin, in his %0a%3c Comedy of the Aulularia,®® though there has been considerable %0a%3c discussion for that very reason among the learned, whether or %0a%3c %0a%3c From aTrevdu), to hasten.

In %0a%3c those times, they had no cooks in the number of their slaves, %0a%3c but used to hire them for the occasion from the market. The %0a%3c Gauls were the first to employ the bolter that is made of %0a%3c horse-hair; while the people of Spain make their sieves and %0a%3c meal-dressers of flax,^® and the Egyptians of papyrus and %0a%3c rushes. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 29 . -AITCA. %0a%3c %0a%3c But among the very first things of all, we ought to speak of %0a%3c the method employed in preparing alica,^® a most delightful %0a%3c and most wholesome food, and which incontestably confers %0a%3c upon Italy the highest rank among the countries that produce %0a%3c the cereals. This delicacy is prepared, no doubt, in Egypt %0a%3c as well, but of a very inferior quality, and not worth our no¬ %0a%3c tice. In Italy, however, it is prepared in numerous places, %0a%3c the territories of Verona and Pisse, :jpr example ; but that of %0a%3c Campania is the most highly esteemed. There, at the foot of %0a%3c mountains capped with clouds, runs a plain, not less in all than %0a%3c forty miles in extent. The land here—to give a description %0a%3c first of the nature of the soil—is dusty on the surface, but %0a%3c spongy below, and as porous as pumice. The inconveniences %0a%3c that generally arise from the close vicinity of mountains are %0a%3c here converted into so many advantages : for the soil, acting %0a%3c on it as a sort of filter, absorbs the water of the abundant %0a%3c rains that fall; the consequence of which is, that the water not %0a%3c being left to soak or form mud on the surface, the cultivation %0a%3c is greatly facilitated thereby. This land does not return, by %0a%3c the aid of any springs, the moisture it has thus absorbed, but %0a%3c thoroughly digests it, by warming it in its bosom, in a heated %0a%3c oven as it were. The ground is kept cropped the whole year %0a%3c through, once with panic, and twice with spelt; and yet in the %0a%3c spring, when the soil is allowed to have a moment’s repose, %0a%3c %0a%3c Which in Pliny’s time signified “ baker.” %0a%3c %0a%3c The Stipa tenacissima of Linnaeus, Fee says; or else the Lygeum %0a%3c gpartum of Linnaeus. %0a%3c %0a%3c 2"* As to the cereal so called, see c. 10 of this Book. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 42 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c pLiirr’a natural history. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XVIir. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c it will produce roses more odoriferous by far than the cultivated %0a%3c rose: for the earth here is never tired of producing, a circum¬ %0a%3c stance in which originated the common saying, that Campania %0a%3c produces more unguents ” than other countries do oil. %0a%3c %0a%3c In the same degree, however, that the Campanian soil excels %0a%3c that of all other countries, so does that part of it which is %0a%3c known to us as Laborise,^® and to the Greeks as Phle^aeum, %0a%3c surpass all the rest. This district is bounded on two sides by %0a%3c the consular high road, which leads from PuteoU to Capua on %0a%3c the one side, and from Cumae on the other. %0a%3c %0a%3c Alica is prepared from the grain called zea, which we have %0a%3c already mentioned®® as being known to us as “ seed” wheat. %0a%3c The grain is cleansed in a wooden mortar, for fear lest stone, %0a%3c from its hardness, should have the effect of grating it. The %0a%3c motive power for raising the pestle, as is generally known, is %0a%3c supplied by slaves working in chains, the end of it being en¬ %0a%3c closed in a case of iron. After the husks have been removed %0a%3c by this process, the pure grain is broken to pieces, the same %0a%3c implements being employed. In this way, there are three %0a%3c different kinds of alica made, the finest, the seconds, and the %0a%3c coarse, which last is known as “ aphaerema.”'*® Still, however, %0a%3c these various kinds have none of them that whiteness as yet %0a%3c for which they are so distinguished, though even now they are %0a%3c preferable to the Alexandrian alica. With this view—a most %0a%3c singular fact—chalk is mixed with the meal, which, upon %0a%3c %0a%3c becoming well incorporated with it, adds very materially to %0a%3c both the whiteness and the shortness of the mixture. This %0a%3c chalk is found between Puteoli and Neapolis, upon a hill called %0a%3c Leucogaeum ;'‘® and there is still in existence a decree of the %0a%3c late Emperor Augustus, (who established a colony at Capua), %0a%3c which orders a sum of twenty thousand sesterces to be paid %0a%3c annually from his exchequer to the people of Neapolis, for the %0a%3c lease of this hill. His motive for paying this rent, he stated, %0a%3c was the fact that the people of Campania had alleged that it %0a%3c Or perfumed oils. %0a%3c %0a%3c ^ See B. iii. c. 9.

This grain is pounded with sand, and even then it is %0a%3c with the greatest difficulty that the outer coats are removed; %0a%3c when stripped, the grain fills one half only of the original %0a%3c measure. Gypsum, in the proportion of one fourth, is then %0a%3c sprinkled over it, and after the mixture has been well incor¬ %0a%3c porated, it is bolted through a meal-sieve. The portion that %0a%3c remains behind, after this is done, is known as “ excepticia,”^® %0a%3c and consists of the coarser parts; while that which has passed %0a%3c through is submitted to a second process, with a finer sieve ; %0a%3c and that which then refuses to pass has the name of “secun- %0a%3c daria.”‘® That, again, which, in a similar manner, is submitted %0a%3c to a third sifting, with a sieve of the greatest fineness, which %0a%3c will only admit of sand passing through it, is known as “ cri- %0a%3c braria,”^'' when it remains on the top of the sieve. %0a%3c %0a%3c There is another method, again, that is employed every %0a%3c where for adulterating it. They pick out the whitest and %0a%3c largest grains of wheat, and parboil them in earthen pots; these %0a%3c are then dried in the sun till they have regained their original, %0a%3c size, after which they are lightly sprinkled with water, and %0a%3c then ground in a mill. A better granaeum ^ is made from zea %0a%3c than from wheat, although it is nothing else, in fact, but a %0a%3c spurious alica: it is whitened by the addition of boiled milk, %0a%3c in place of chalk. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 30.

Bean meal is kuown as “lomentum;” and, as is %0a%3c the case with the meal of all leguminous plants, it adds con¬ %0a%3c siderably, when mixed with flour, to the weight of the bread. %0a%3c Beans are on sale at the present day for numerous purposes, %0a%3c and are employed for feeding cattle, and man more particu¬ %0a%3c larly. They are mixed, also, among most nations, with %0a%3c wheat,®® and panic more particularly, either whole or lightly %0a%3c broken. In our ancient ceremonials, too, bean pottage®^ occu¬ %0a%3c pies its place in the religious services of the gods. Beans are %0a%3c mostly eaten together with other food, but it is generally %0a%3c thought that they dull the senses, and cause sleepless nights %0a%3c attended Avith dreams. Hence it is that the bean has been %0a%3c condemned®* by Pythagoras; though, according to some, the %0a%3c reason for this denunciation was the belief Avhich he enter¬ %0a%3c tained that the souls of the dead are enclosed in the bean: it %0a%3c is for this reason, too, that beans are used in the funereal ban¬ %0a%3c quets of the Parentalia.®® According to Varro, it is for a %0a%3c similar cause that the Flamen abstains from eating beans : in %0a%3c addition to which, on the blossom of the bean, there are cer¬ %0a%3c tain letters of ill omen to be found. %0a%3c %0a%3c There are some peculiar religious usages connected with the %0a%3c bean. It is the custom to bring home from the harvest a bean %0a%3c by way of auspice, which, from that circumstance, has the %0a%3c name of “ referiva.”®^ In sales by public auction, too, it is %0a%3c thought lucky to include a bean in the lot for sale. It is a %0a%3c fact, too, that the bean is the only one among all the grains %0a%3c that fills out at the increase of the moon,®® however much it %0a%3c may have been eaten away: it can never be thoroughly boiled %0a%3c in sea-water, or indeed any other water that is salt. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Faba vulgaris of the modern naturalists. It is supposed to have %0a%3c originally come from Persia. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is said that this mixture is still employed in the Valais and in %0a%3c Savoy. %0a%3c %0a%3c Fabata. %0a%3c %0a%3c Beans were used in ancient times, in place of balls or pebbles, in %0a%3c voting by ballot. _ Hence it has been suggested that P}-thagoras, in recom¬ %0a%3c mending his disciples to abstain from beans, meant to advise them to have %0a%3c nothing to do with politics. %0a%3c %0a%3c The sacrifices ofi'ered to the Manes or spirits of deceased relations. %0a%3c See Ovid’s Fasti, B. ii. 1. 56,5. %0a%3c %0a%3c ^ “ Brought home.” The bean was offered up, to ensure good luck. %0a%3c %0a%3c M Didymos, in the Geoponica, B. ii. c. 33, repeats this absurdity. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 30.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c THE BEA2T. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 45 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The bean is the first leguminous plant that is sown; that %0a%3c being done before the setting of the Vergilias, in order that it %0a%3c may pass the winter in the ground. Virgil^ recommends that %0a%3c it should be sown in spring, according to the usage of the parts %0a%3c of Italj near the Padus: but most people prefer the bean that %0a%3c has been sown early to that of only three months’ growth; %0a%3c for, in the former case, the pods as well as the stalk afibid a %0a%3c most agreeable fodder for cattle. When in blossoiii more par¬ %0a%3c ticularly, the bean requires water; but after the blossom has %0a%3c passed off, it stands in need of but very little. It fertilizes®^ %0a%3c the grouud in which it has been sown as well as any manure; %0a%3c hence it is that in the neighbourhood of Thessaly and Ma¬ %0a%3c cedonia, as soon 'as it begins to blossom, they turn up®® the %0a%3c ground. %0a%3c %0a%3c The bean, too, grows wild in most countries, as in those %0a%3c islands of the Northern Ocean, for instance, which for that %0a%3c reason have been called by us the “Pabarige.”®® In Mauritania, %0a%3c also, it is found in a wild state in various parts, but so remark¬ %0a%3c ably hard that it will never become soft by boiling. %0a%3c %0a%3c In Egypt there is a kind of bean®® which grows upon a %0a%3c thorny stalk; for which reason the crocodiles avoid it, being %0a%3c apprehensive of danger to their eyes. This stalk is four %0a%3c cubits in length, and its thickness, at the very most, that of %0a%3c the finger : were it not for the absence of articulations in it, %0a%3c it would resemble a soft reed in appearance. The head is %0a%3c similar to that of the poppy, being of a rose colour : the beans %0a%3c enclosed in this head are not above thirty in number; the %0a%3c leaves are large, and the fruit is bitter and odoriferous. The %0a%3c root, however, is highly esteemed by the natives as a food, %0a%3c whether eaten raw or well boiled ; it bears a strong resem¬ %0a%3c blance to that of the reed. This plant grows also in Syria %0a%3c and Cilicia, and upon the banks of Lake Torone in Chalcidice. %0a%3c %0a%3c *%3c5 Georg, i. 215. %0a%3c %0a%3c Tliis notion still prevails, and tlie bean, while in blossom, is dug into %0a%3c the ground to manure it, both in England and France. %0a%3c %0a%3c It docs not appear, however, that this was done with the view of %0a%3c digging in the beans. %0a%3c %0a%3c Or Bean Islands.

The chicheling vetch,®® too, is a diminutive kind of %0a%3c chick-pea, unequal and angular, like®' the pea. The chick¬ %0a%3c pea that is the sweetest in flavour is the one that bears the %0a%3c closest resemblance to the fitch; the pod in the black and the %0a%3c red kinds is more firmly closed than in the white ones. %0a%3c %0a%3c Pisum sativum of Linnaeus. %0a%3c %0a%3c Meaning a wart or pimple on the face. %0a%3c %0a%3c Cicer arietinum of the botanists. %0a%3c %0a%3c 61 « Gigni cum salsilagine.” It abounds in India, and while blossom¬ %0a%3c ing, it distils a corrosive acid, which corrodes the shoes of those who tread %0a%3c upon it. %0a%3c %0a%3c There are still the red and the white kinds, the large and the small %0a%3c %0a%3c Cicercula: the Lathyrus sativus of Linnaeus.

The smaller %0a%3c the seed the better it is in quality. There are three kinds of %0a%3c rape in all; the first is broad and flat, the second of a spherical %0a%3c shape, and the third, to which the name of “ wild” rape” %0a%3c has been given, throws out a long root, similar in appearance %0a%3c to a radish, with an angular, rough leaf, and an acrid juice, %0a%3c which, if extracted about harvest, and mixed with a woman’s %0a%3c milk, is good for cleansing the eyes and improving defective %0a%3c sight. The colder the weather the sweeter they are, and the %0a%3c larger, it is generally thought; heat makes them run to leaf. %0a%3c The finest rape of all is that grown in the district of Isiirsk: %0a%3c it is valued at as much as one sesterce’'® per pound, and, in %0a%3c times of scarcity, two even.

To prevent it from springing %0a%3c out of the pod®* while being gathered, and so lost, the best %0a%3c plan is to gather it immediately after a shower. Of all the %0a%3c seeds that are sown, there is not one of a more marvellous na¬ %0a%3c ture than this, or more favoured by the earth. First of all, %0a%3c it turns every day with the sun,®® and shows the hour to the %0a%3c husbandman, even though the weather should happen to be %0a%3c cloudy and overcast.

We have already stated*^ that the %0a%3c soil of a field or vineyard is enriched by the growth of a %0a%3c crop of lupines; indeed, so far is it from standing in need of %0a%3c manure, that the lupines will act upon it as well as the very %0a%3c best. It is the only seed that requires no outlay at all, so %0a%3c much so, in fact, that there is no necessity to carry it even to the %0a%3c spot where it is sown ; for it may be sown the moment it is %0a%3c brought from the threshing-floor and from the fact that it %0a%3c falls fi’om the pod of its own accord, it stands in need of no %0a%3c one to scatter it. %0a%3c %0a%3c Thisfs®® the very first grain sown and the last that is gathered, %0a%3c both operations generally taking place in the month of Sep¬ %0a%3c tember ; indeed, if this is not done before winter sets in, it is %0a%3c liable to receive injury from the cold. And then, besides, it %0a%3c may even be left with impunity to lie upon the ground, in case %0a%3c showers should not immediately ensue and cover it in, it being %0a%3c quite safe from the attacks of all animals, on account of its %0a%3c bitter taste : still, however, it is mostly covered up in a slight %0a%3c furrow. Among the thicker soils, it is attached to a red earth %0a%3c more particularly. In order to enrich**® this earth, it should be %0a%3c turned up just after the third blossom ; but where the soil is %0a%3c sandy, after the second. Chalky and slimy soils are the only %0a%3c ones that it lias an aversion to; indeed, it will never come to %0a%3c anything when sown in them. Soaked in warm water, it is %0a%3c used as a food, too, for man. One modius is a sufficient meal %0a%3c for an ox, and it is found to impart considerable vigour to %0a%3c cattle; placed, too, upon the abdomen®^ of children, it acts as %0a%3c a remedy in certain cases. It is an excellent plan to season %0a%3c the lupine by smoking it; for when it is kept in a moist state, %0a%3c maggots are apt to attack the germ, and render it useless for %0a%3c reproduction. If cattle have eaten it off Avhile in leaf, as a %0a%3c matter of necessity it should be ploughed in as soon as possible. %0a%3c %0a%3c In B. xvii. c. 6. %0a%3c %0a%3c ** “ El area.” This reading is favoured by the text of Columella.

It is sown after the %0a%3c ground has been but once turned up, and requires neither hoe- %0a%3c ing nor manuring; nothing at all, indeed', except harrowing. %0a%3c There are three periods for sowing it; the first is about the %0a%3c setting of Arcturus, when it is intended for feeding cattle %0a%3c in the month of December, while in the blade ; this crop, too, %0a%3c is the best of all for seed, for, although grazed upon, it will %0a%3c bear just as well. The second crop is sown in the month of %0a%3c January, and the last in March ; this last being the best crop %0a%3c for fodder. Of all the seeds this is the one that thrives best %0a%3c in a dry soil; still, however, it manifests no repugnance to %0a%3c a shaded locality. This grain, if gathered when quite ripe, %0a%3c produces a chaff superior to that of any other.

So su¬ %0a%3c perior are its qualities, that a single sowing will last more %0a%3c than thirty^ years. It resembles trefoil in appearance, but the %0a%3c stalk and leaves are articulated. The longer it grows in the %0a%3c stalk, the narrower is the leaf. Amphilochus has devoted a %0a%3c whole book to this subject and the cytisus.® The ground in %0a%3c which it is sown, being first cleaned and cleared of stones, is %0a%3c turned up in the autumn, after which it is ploughed and har¬ %0a%3c rowed. It is then harrowed a second and a third time, at in¬ %0a%3c tervals of five days ; after which manure is laid upon it. This %0a%3c seed requires either a soil that is dry, but full of nutriment, or %0a%3c else a well-watered one. After the ground has been thus pre¬ %0a%3c pared, the seed is put in in the month of May ;® for if sown %0a%3c earlier, it is in danger from the frosts. It is necessary to sow %0a%3c the seed verj' thick, so that all the ground may be occupied, %0a%3c and no room left for weeds to shoot up in the intervals ; a %0a%3c result which may be secured by sowing twenty modii to the %0a%3c jugerum. The seed must be stirred at once with the rake, to %0a%3c prevent the sun from scorching it, and it should be covered %0a%3c over with earth as speedily as possible. If the soil is naturally %0a%3c damp or weedy, the lucerne will be overpowered, and the spot %0a%3c %0a%3c Fee suggests that this may he the Avena sterilis, or else the Avena %0a%3c fatua of Linnajus. %0a%3c %0a%3c * De Re Rust.

It remains for us %0a%3c now to complete our account of all the cereals, and we shall %0a%3c here devote a portion of it to the diseases to which they are %0a%3c subject. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 44 . ( 17 .) —THE DISEASES OF GRAIN :>THE OAT. %0a%3c %0a%3c ■ The foremost feature of disease in wheat is the oat.® Barley, %0a%3c too, will degenerate into the oat; so much so, in fact, that the %0a%3c oat has become an equivalent for corn; for the people of Ger¬ %0a%3c many are in the habit of sowing it, and make their porridge of %0a%3c nothing else. This degeneracy is owing more particularly to %0a%3c humidity of soil and climate; and a second cause is a weakness in %0a%3c the seed, the result of its being retained too long in the ground %0a%3c before it makes its appearance above it. The same, too, will %0a%3c %0a%3c ’’ By the aid of careful watering, as many as eight to fourteen cuttings %0a%3c are obtained in the year, in Italy and Spain. In the north of Europe %0a%3c there is but one crop. %0a%3c %0a%3c ® In B. xiii. c. 47. %0a%3c %0a%3c 9 He borrows this notion of the oat being wheat in a diseased state, %0a%3c from Theophrastus. Singularly enough, it was adopted by the learned %0a%3c Buffon. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 44.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c THE DISEASES OE QBAIN. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 55 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c be the consequence, if the seed is decayed when put in the %0a%3c ground. This may be known, however, the moment it makes %0a%3c its appearance, from which it is quite evident, that the defect %0a%3c lies in the root. There is another form of disease, too, which %0a%3c closely resembles the oat, and which supervenes when the %0a%3c grain, already developed to its full size, hut not ripe, is struck %0a%3c by a noxious blast, before it has acquired its proper body and %0a%3c strength; in this case, the seed pines away in the ear, by a %0a%3c kind of abortion, as it were, and totally disappears. %0a%3c %0a%3c The wind is injurious to wheat and barley, at three'® periods %0a%3c of the year in particular: when they are in blossom, directly %0a%3c the blossom has passed off, and just as the seed is beginning to %0a%3c ripen. In this last case, the grain wastes away, while in the %0a%3c two former ones it is prevented from being developed. Gleams %0a%3c of sunshine, every now and then, from the midst of clouds, %0a%3c are injurious to corn. Maggots, too, breed ” in the roots, when %0a%3c the rains that follow the seed-time are succeeded by a sudden %0a%3c heat, which encloses the humidity in the ground. Maggots %0a%3c make their appearance,’^ also, in the grain, when the ear fer¬ %0a%3c ments through heat succeeding a fall of rain. There is a small %0a%3c beetle, too, known by the name of “ cantharis,”'® which eats %0a%3c away the blade. All these insects die, however, as soon as %0a%3c their nutriment fails them. Oil,’* pitch, and grease are pre¬ %0a%3c judicial to grain, and care should be taken not to let them come %0a%3c in contact with the seed that is sown. Eain is only beneficial %0a%3c to grain while in the blade ; it is injurious to wheat and barley ' %0a%3c while they are in blossom, but is not detrimental to the legu¬ %0a%3c minous plants, with the exception of the chick-pea. When %0a%3c grain is beginning to ripen, rain is injurious, and to barley in %0a%3c particular. There is a white grass that grows in the fields, %0a%3c very similar to panic in appearance, but fatal to cattle. As to %0a%3c %0a%3c 10 From Theophrastus, Hist. Plant. B. viii. c. 10. %0a%3c %0a%3c '* This but rarely happens in our climates, as Fee remarks. %0a%3c %0a%3c Ill The grains are sometimes, though rarely, foimd devoured on the %0a%3c stalk, by a kind of larvae. %0a%3c %0a%3c '0 Some coleopterous insect, probably, now unknown, and not the Can- %0a%3c tharis vesicatoria, or “ Spanish fly,” as some have imagined. Diosco- %0a%3c rides and Athenaeus state to the same effect as Pliny. %0a%3c %0a%3c The proper influence of the humidity of the earth would naturally %0a%3c be impeded by a coating of these substances. %0a%3c %0a%3c This plant has not been identified; but none of the gramineous %0a%3c plants are noxious to cattle, with the exception of the seed of darnel. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 56 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Pliny's natueal histohy. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XVIII. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c darnel,'*’ the tribulus,” the thistle,'* and the burdock,'® I can %0a%3c consider them, no more than the bramble, among the maladies %0a%3c that attack the cereals, but rather as so raan}'^ pests inflicted on %0a%3c the earth. Mildew,*® a malady resulting from the inclemency %0a%3c of the weather, and equally attacking the A’ine *' and corn, is %0a%3c in no degree less injurious. It attacks corn most frequently in %0a%3c localities which are exposed to dews, and in vallies which have %0a%3c not a thorough draught for the wind ; windy and elevated %0a%3c spots, on the other hand, are totally exempt from it. Another %0a%3c evil, again, in corn, is over-luxuriance, when it falls to the %0a%3c ground beneath the weight ** of the grain. One evil, however, %0a%3c to which all crops in common, the chick-pea even, are exposed, %0a%3c is the attacks of the caterpillar, when the rain, by washing %0a%3c away the natural saltness of the vegetation, makes it** all the %0a%3c more tempting for its sweetness. %0a%3c %0a%3c There is a certain plant,too, which kills the chick-pea and %0a%3c the fitch, by twining around them ; the name of it is “ oro- %0a%3c banche.” In a similar manner, also, wheat is attacked by %0a%3c darnel,*® barley by a long-stalked plant, called “ aegilops,”*® and %0a%3c the lentil by an axe-leafed grass, to which, from the resem¬ %0a%3c blance*' of the leaf, the Greeks have given the name of “pele- %0a%3c cinon.” All these plants, too, kill the others by entwining %0a%3c around them. In the neighbourhood of Philippi, there is a %0a%3c plant known as ateramon,*® which grows in a rich soil, and %0a%3c %0a%3c Lolium temulentum of Linnajus. See B. xxi. c. 58. %0a%3c %0a%3c “ Carduus.” A general term, probably including the genera Centaurea %0a%3c (the prickly kinds), Serratula, Carduus, and Cnicus.

If intro¬ %0a%3c duced into bread, it will speedily produce vertigo; and it is %0a%3c said that in Asia and Greece, the bath-keepers, when they want %0a%3c to dispense a crowd of people, throw this seed upon burning %0a%3c coals. The phalangium, a diminutive insect of the spider %0a%3c genus,'” breeds in the fitch, if the winter happens to be wet. %0a%3c Slugs, too, breed in the vetch, and sometimes a tiny snail makes %0a%3c its way out of the ground, and eats it away in a most singular %0a%3c manner. %0a%3c %0a%3c These are pretty nearly all the maladies to which grain is %0a%3c subject. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 45 . -THE BEST REMEDIES FOR THE DISEASES OF GRAIN. %0a%3c %0a%3c The best remedy for these maladies, so long as grain is in %0a%3c the blade, is the weeding-hook, and, at the moment of sowing, %0a%3c ashes.As to those diseases which develope themselves in the %0a%3c seed and about the root, with due care precautions may be ef¬ %0a%3c fectually employed against them. It is generally supposed that %0a%3c if seed has been first steeped in wine,®‘ it will be less exposed %0a%3c to disease. Yirgil recommends that beans should be drenched %0a%3c with nitre and amurca of olives; and he says that if this is %0a%3c done, they will be all the larger. Some persons, again, are of %0a%3c opinion, that they will grow of increased size, if the seed is %0a%3c steeped for three days before it is sown in a solution of urine %0a%3c and water. If the ground, too, is hoed three times, a modius %0a%3c of beans in the pod, they say, wifi, yield not less than a modius %0a%3c %0a%3c the vicinity of Philippi makes the beans difficult to cook or boil, arepdfiovfQ. %0a%3c From this word he has coined two imaginary plants, the “ateramon,” %0a%3c and the “ teramon.” Ilardouin defends Pliny, by suggesting that he has %0a%3c borrowed the passage from another source, while Fee doubts if he really %0a%3c understood the Greek language. %0a%3c %0a%3c More probably one of the Coleoptera. He borrows from Theo¬ %0a%3c phrastus, Hist. Anim. B. viii. c. 10. %0a%3c %0a%3c This will only prevent the young plants from becoming a prey to %0a%3c snails and slugs. %0a%3c %0a%3c This plan is attended with no good results. %0a%3c %0a%3c Georg, i. 193. It is generally said that if seed is steeped in a solu¬ %0a%3c tion of nitre, and more particularly hydrochloric acid, it will germinate %0a%3c with accelerated rapidity; the produce, however, is no finer than at other %0a%3c times. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 58 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Pliny’s natueal histoey. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XVIII. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c of shelled beans. Other seeds, again, it is said, will be %0a%3c exempt from the attacks of maggots, if bruised C3’press^ leaves %0a%3c are mixed with them, or if the}' are sown just at the moon’s %0a%3c conjunction. Many persons, for the more effectual protection %0a%3c of millet, recommend that a bramble-frog should be carried at %0a%3c night round the field before the hoeing is done, and then buried %0a%3c in an earthen vessel in the middle of it. If this is done, they %0a%3c say, neither sparrows nor worms will attack the crop. The %0a%3c frog, however, must be disinterred before the millet is cut; for %0a%3c if this is neglected, the produce Avill be bitter. It is pretended, %0a%3c too, that all seeds which have been touched by the shoulders %0a%3c of a mole are remarkably productive. %0a%3c %0a%3c Democritus recommends that all seeds before they are sown %0a%3c should be steeped in the juice of the herb known as “ aizoum,”“ %0a%3c which grows on tiles or shingles, and is known to us by the %0a%3c Latin name of " sedum” or “ digitellum.”^® If blight pre¬ %0a%3c vails, or if .worms are found adhering to the roots, it is a very %0a%3c common rem.edy to sprinkle the plants with pure amurca of %0a%3c olives without salt, and then to hoe the ground. If, however, %0a%3c the crop should be beginning to joint, it should be stubbed at %0a%3c once, for fear lest the weeds should gain the upper hand. I %0a%3c know for certain*’ that flights of starlings and sparrows, those %0a%3c pests to millet and panic, are effectually driven away by means %0a%3c of a certain herb, the name of which is unknown to me, being %0a%3c buried at the four corners of the field: it is a wonderful thing %0a%3c to relate, but in such case not a single bird will enter it. Mice %0a%3c are kept away by the ashes of a weasel or a cat being steeped %0a%3c in water and then thrown upon the seed, or else by using the %0a%3c water in w hich the body of a weasel or a eat has been boiled. %0a%3c The odour, however, of these animals makes itself perceived %0a%3c in the bread even; for which reason it is generally thought a %0a%3c better plan to steep the seed in ox-gaU.*® As for mildew, %0a%3c that greatest curse of all to corn, if branches of laurel ure %0a%3c %0a%3c 33 “FracttE.” Perhaps, more properly “crushed.” %0a%3c %0a%3c The odour of cypress, or savin.

Over-luxuriance in corn is repressed by %0a%3c the teeth of cattle,®® but only while it is in the blade; in which %0a%3c case, if depastured upon ever so often, no injury to it when %0a%3c in the ear will be the result. If the ear, too, is once cut oif, %0a%3c the grain, it is well known, will assume a larger^*^ form, but %0a%3c will be hollow within and worthless, and if sown, will come %0a%3c to nothing. %0a%3c %0a%3c At Babylon, however, they cut the blade twice, and then %0a%3c let the cattle pasture on it a third time, for otherwise it would %0a%3c run to nothing but leaf. Even then, however, so fertile is the %0a%3c soil, that it yields fifty, and, indeed, with care, as much as a %0a%3c hundred, fold. Hor is the cultivation of it attended with any %0a%3c difficulty, the only object being to let the ground be under %0a%3c water as long as possible, in order that the extreme richness %0a%3c and exuberance of the soil may be modified. The Euphrates, %0a%3c however, and the Tigris do not deposit a slime, in the same %0a%3c way that the ISTilus does in Egypt, nor does the soil produce %0a%3c vegetation spontaneously ; but still, so great is the fertility, %0a%3c that, although the seed is only trodden in with the foot, a crop %0a%3c springs up spontaneously the following year, go great a dif¬ %0a%3c ference in soils as this, reminds me that I ought to take this %0a%3c opportunity of specifying those which are the best adapted %0a%3c for the various kinds of grain. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 46 . —THE CHOPS THAT SHOULD BE SOWN IN THE DIFFERENT %0a%3c SOILS. %0a%3c %0a%3c This, then, is the opinion expressed by Cato'*' on the subject: %0a%3c “ In a dense and fertile soil wheat should be sown: but if the %0a%3c locality is subject to fogs, rape, radishes, millet, and panic. %0a%3c Where the land*® is cold and moist, sowing should be com¬ %0a%3c menced earlier ; but where it is hot, at a later period. In a %0a%3c red, black, or gravelly soil, provided it is not watery, lupines %0a%3c should be sown; but in chalk, red earth, or a watery soil, %0a%3c spelt.*® Where a locality is dry, free from weeds, and not %0a%3c overshadowed, wheat should be put in ; and where the soil is %0a%3c %0a%3c 39 Virgil, Georg, i.

Vetches should be grown in a %0a%3c soil as free from water and weeds as possible; while wheat %0a%3c and winter wheat are best adapted to an open, elevated loca¬ %0a%3c lity, fully exposed to the warmth of the sun. The lentil %0a%3c thrives best in a meagre, red earth, free from weeds. Barley is %0a%3c equally suited for fallow land and for a soil that is not intended %0a%3c to be follow, and three-month wheat, for a soil upon which a %0a%3c crop of ordinary wheat would never ripen, but strong enough %0a%3c to bear.” %0a%3c %0a%3c The following, too, is sound advice Those plants should %0a%3c be sown in a thin soil which do not stand in need of much %0a%3c nutriment, the cytisus, for instance, and such of the leguminous %0a%3c plants, with the exception of the chick-pea, as are taken up %0a%3c by the roots and not cut. From this mode of gathering them %0a%3c —“ legere”—the legumina derive their name. Where it is a %0a%3c rich earth, those plants should be grown which require a %0a%3c greater proportion of nutriment, coleworts for instance, wheat, %0a%3c winter-wheat, and flax. The result, then, will be, that a %0a%3c light soil will be given to barley—the root of that grain stand¬ %0a%3c ing in need of less nutriment—while a more dense, though %0a%3c easily-worked soil, will be assigned to wheat. In humid loca¬ %0a%3c lities spelt should be sown in preference to wheat; but where %0a%3c the soil is of moderate temperature, either wheat or barley %0a%3c may be grown. Declivities produce a stronger growth of %0a%3c wheat, but in smaller quantities. Spelt and winter-wheat %0a%3c adopt a moist, cretaceous soil in preference to any other. %0a%3c %0a%3c (18.) The only occasion on which there ever was a prodigy %0a%3c connected with grain, at least that I am aware of, was in the %0a%3c consulship of P.

In that country, performing the %0a%3c duties of the husbandman, the Nile begins to overflow, as %0a%3c already stated,^^ immediately after the summer solstice or the %0a%3c new moon, gradually at first, but afterwards with increased %0a%3c impetuosity, as long as the sun remains in the sign of Leo. %0a%3c When the sun has passed into Yirgo, the impetuosity of the %0a%3c overflow begins to slacken, and when he has entered Libra the %0a%3c river subsides. Should it not have exceeded twelve cubits in %0a%3c its overflow, famine is the sure result; and this is equally the %0a%3c case if it should chance to exceed sixteen; for the higher it %0a%3c has risen, the more slowly it subsides, and, of course, the seed¬ %0a%3c time is impeded in proportion. It was formerly a very general %0a%3c belief that immediately upon the subsiding of the waters the %0a%3c Egyptians were in the habit of driving herds of swine over %0a%3c the ground, for the purpose of treading the seed into the moist %0a%3c soil—and it is my own impression that this was done in ancient %0a%3c times. At the present day even, tlie operation is not attended %0a%3c with much greater labour. It is well known, however, that %0a%3c the seed is first laid upon the slime that has been left by the %0a%3c river on its subsidence, and then ploughed in; this being done %0a%3c at the beginning of November. After this is done, a few per¬ %0a%3c sons are employed in stubbing, an operation known there as %0a%3c “ botanismos.” The rest of the labourers, however, have no %0a%3c occasion to visit the land again tiU a little before the calends %0a%3c of April,** and then it is with the reaping-hook. The harvest %0a%3c is completed in the month of May. The stem is never so %0a%3c much as a cubit in length, as there is a stratum of sand be¬ %0a%3c neath the slime, from which last alone the grain receives its %0a%3c support. The best wheat of all is that of the region of %0a%3c Thebais, Egypt** being of a marshy character. %0a%3c %0a%3c The method adopted at Seleucia in Babylonia is very similar %0a%3c to this, but the fertility there is still greater, owing to the %0a%3c oveiHow of the Euphrates and Tigris,®* the degree of irriga¬ %0a%3c tion being artificially modified in those parts.

The coulter®^ is the iron part %0a%3c that cuts up the dense earth before it is broken into pieces, and %0a%3c traces beforehand by its incisions the future furrows, which the %0a%3c share, reversed,®* is to open out with its teeth. Another kind— %0a%3c the common plough-share—is nothing more than a lever, fur¬ %0a%3c nished with a pointed bealc; while another variety, which is only %0a%3c used in light, easy soils, does not present an edge projecting from %0a%3c the share-beam throughout, but only a small point at the ex¬ %0a%3c tremity. In a fourth kind again, this point is larger and formed %0a%3c with a cutting edge ; by the agency of which implement, it %0a%3c both cleaves the ground, and, with the sharp edges at the sides, %0a%3c cuts up the weeds by the roots. There has been invented, at a %0a%3c comparatively recent period, in that part of Gaul®® known as %0a%3c Khmtia, a plough with the addition of two small wheels, and %0a%3c known by the name of “ plaumorati.”®^ The extremity of the %0a%3c share in this has the form of a spade : it is only used, however, %0a%3c for sowing in cultivated lands, and upon soils which are nearly %0a%3c fallow. The broader the plough-share, the better it is for %0a%3c turning up the clods of earth. Immediately after ploughing, %0a%3c the seed is put into the ground, and then harrows®® with long %0a%3c teeth are drawn over it. Lands which have been sown in this %0a%3c way require no hoeing, but two or three pairs of oxen are em¬ %0a%3c ployed in ploughing.

Good ploughing. What is the %0a%3c second point? Ploughing again. What is the third point? %0a%3c Manuring. Take care not to make crooked furrows. Be %0a%3c careful to plough at the proper time.” In warm localities it %0a%3c is necessary to open the ground immediately after the winter %0a%3c solstice, but where it is cold, directly after the vernal equinox : %0a%3c this, too, should be done sooner in dry districts than in wet ones, %0a%3c in a dense soil than a loose one, in a rich land than a meagre %0a%3c one. In countries where the summers are hot and oppressive, %0a%3c the soil cretaceous or thin, it is the best plan to plough between %0a%3c tlie summer solstice and the autumnal equinox. Where, on %0a%3c the other hand, the heat is moderate, with frequent falls of rain, %0a%3c and the soil rich and full of vegetation, the ploughing should %0a%3c be done during the prevalence of the heat. A deep, heavy %0a%3c soil, again, should be ploughed in winter; but one that is very %0a%3c thin and dr}’, only just before putting in the seed. %0a%3c %0a%3c Tillage, too, has its own particular rules®®—N^ever touch the %0a%3c ground while it is wet and cloggy ; plough with all your might; %0a%3c loosen the ground before you begin to plough. This method %0a%3c has its advantages, for by turning up the clods the roots of the %0a%3c weeds are killed. Some persons recommend that in every case %0a%3c the ground should be turned up immediately after the vernal %0a%3c equinox. Land that has been ploughed once in spring, from %0a%3c that circumstance has the namecf “ vervactum.”®’ This, too, %0a%3c is equally necessary in the case of fallow land, by which term %0a%3c is meant land that is sown only in alternate years The oxen %0a%3c employed in ploughing should be harnessed as tightly as pos¬ %0a%3c sible, to make them plough with their heads up; attention %0a%3c paid to this point will prevent them from galling the neck. If %0a%3c it is among trees and vines that you are ploughing, the oxen %0a%3c should be muzzled, to prevent them from eating off the tender %0a%3c buds. There should be a small bill-hook, too, projecting from %0a%3c the plough-tail, for the purpose of cutting up the roots; this %0a%3c plan being preferable to that of turning them up with the share, %0a%3c and so straining the oxen. When ploughing, finish the furrow %0a%3c at one spell, and never stop to take breath in the middle. %0a%3c %0a%3c “ De Re Rust. c. 61. %0a%3c %0a%3c These rules are borrowed mostly from Varro, B. i. c. 19, and Colu¬ %0a%3c mella, B. ii. c. 4. %0a%3c %0a%3c ^ “ Vere actum “ worked in spring.” %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 64 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c flint’s NAlTUKAL histoet. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XVIII. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c It is a fair day’s work to plough one jugerum, for the first %0a%3c time, nine inches in depth ; and the second time, one jugerum %0a%3c and a half—that is to say, if it is an easy soil.

A single hand per jugerum will be quite enough for %0a%3c any one of these kinds of grain. The operation of hoeing %0a%3c loosens the ground in spring when it has been hardened and %0a%3c saddened by the rigours of the winter, and admits the early %0a%3c sun to the interior. In hoeing, every care must he taken not %0a%3c to go beneath the roots of the corn ; in the case of wheat, zea, %0a%3c and barley, it is best to give a couple of hoeings. Stubbing,’® %0a%3c when the crop is just beginning to joint, cleanses it of all %0a%3c noxious weeds, disengages the roots of the corn, and liberates %0a%3c the growing blade from the clods. Among the leguminous %0a%3c plants, the chick-pea requires the same treatment that spelt %0a%3c does. The bean requires no stubbing, being quite able of itself %0a%3c to overpower all weeds; the lupine, too, is harrowed only. %0a%3c Millet and panic are both harrowed and hoed; but this opera¬ %0a%3c tion is never repeated, and they do not require stubbing. %0a%3c Fenugreek and the kidney-bean require harrowing only. %0a%3c %0a%3c There are some kinds of ground, the extreme fertility of %0a%3c which obliges the grower to comb down the crops while in the %0a%3c blade—this is done with a sort of harrow” armed with pointed %0a%3c iron teeth—and even then he is obliged to depasture cattle upon %0a%3c them. When, however, the blade has been thus eaten down, %0a%3c it stands in need of hoeing to restore it to its former vigour. %0a%3c %0a%3c But in Bactria, and at Cyrenae in Africa, all this trouble has %0a%3c been rendered quite unnecessary by the indulgent benignity of %0a%3c the climate, and after the seed is in, the owner has no occasion %0a%3c to return to the field till the time has come for getting in the %0a%3c harvest. In those parts the natural dryness of the soil prevents %0a%3c noxious weeds from springing up, and, aided by the night dews %0a%3c alone, the soil supplies its nutriment to the grain. VirgU’* %0a%3c recommends that the ground should be left to enjoy repose every %0a%3c other year; and this, no doubt, if the extent of the farm will %0a%3c admit of it, is the most advantageous plan.

The soil there, which is always well-watered, en¬ %0a%3c joys a degree of fertility quite marvellous. Through this %0a%3c spot, which extends about three miles each way, a spring of %0a%3c water flows—in great abundance it is true—but still, it is only %0a%3c at certain hours that its waters are distributed among the in¬ %0a%3c habitants. Here, beneath a palm of enormous size, grows the %0a%3c olive, beneath the olive the fig, beneath the fig, again, the pome¬ %0a%3c granate, beneath the pomegranate the vine, and beneath the %0a%3c vine we find sown, first wheat, then the leguminous plants, and %0a%3c after them garden herbs—all in the same year, and all growing %0a%3c beneath another’s shade. Four cubits square of this same %0a%3c ground—the cubit’® being measured with the fingers contracted %0a%3c and not extended—sell at the rate of four denarii.’® But what %0a%3c is more surprising than all, is the fact that here the vine bears %0a%3c twice, and that there are two vintages in the year. Indeed, %0a%3c if the fertility of the soil were not distributed in this way %0a%3c among a multitude of productions, each crop would perish from %0a%3c its own exuberance : as it is, there is no part of the year that %0a%3c there is not some crop or other being gathered in; and yet, it %0a%3c is a well-known fact, that the people do nothing at all to pro¬ %0a%3c mote this fruitfulness. %0a%3c %0a%3c ’* In B. xvii. c. 7. %0a%3c %0a%3c See B.

Millet, panic, rape, and tur¬ %0a%3c nips should never be sown in any but a manured soil. If, on %0a%3c the other hand, the land is not manured, sow wheat there in %0a%3c preference to barley. The same, too, with fallow lands; %0a%3c though in these it is generally recommended that beans should %0a%3c be sown. It should be remembered, however, that wherever %0a%3c beans are sown, the land should have been manured at as re¬ %0a%3c cent a period as possible. If it is intended to crop ground in %0a%3c autumn, care must be taken to plough in manure in the month %0a%3c of September, just after rain has fallen. In the same way, %0a%3c too, if it is intended to sow in spring, the manure should be %0a%3c spread in the winter. It is the rule to give eighteen cart-loads %0a%3c of manure to each jugerum, and to spread it well before %0a%3c ploughing it in,®^ or sowing the seed.®* If this manuring, %0a%3c however, is omitted, it will be requisite to spread the land %0a%3c with aviary dust just before hoeing is commenced. To clear %0a%3c up any doubts with reference to this point, I would here ob¬ %0a%3c serve that the fair price for a cart-load of manure is one %0a%3c denarius; where, too, sheep furnish one cart-load, the larger %0a%3c cattle should furnish ten:®® unless this result is obtained, it %0a%3c is a clear proof that the husbandman has littered his cattle %0a%3c badly. %0a%3c %0a%3c There are some persons who are of opinion that the best %0a%3c method of manuring land is to pen sheep there, with nets %0a%3c erected to prevent them from straying. If land is not ma¬ %0a%3c nured, it will get chilled ; but if, on the other hand, it is over¬ %0a%3c manured, it becomes burnt up : it is a much better plan, too, %0a%3c to manure little and often than in excess. The wai’mer the %0a%3c soil is by nature, the less manure it requires. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 54.

The grains of^ those ears which have %0a%3c intervals between the seed should be rejected. The best gram %0a%3c is that which has a reddish hue,®® and which, when broken %0a%3c between the teeth, presents the same®® colour that which has %0a%3c more Avhite within is of inferior quality. It is a well-known %0a%3c fact that some lands require more seed than others, from which %0a%3c circumstance first arose a superstition that exists among the %0a%3c peasantry ; it is their belief that when the ground demands the %0a%3c seed with greater avidity than usual, it is famished, and devours %0a%3c the grain. It is consistent with reason to. put in the seed %0a%3c where the soil is humid sooner than elsewhere, to prevent the %0a%3c grain from rotting in the rain : on dry spots it shoifid be sown %0a%3c later, and just before the fall of a shower, so that it may not %0a%3c have to lie long without germinating and so come to nothing. %0a%3c When the seed is put in early it should be sown thick, as it is %0a%3c a considerable time before it germinates; but when it is put %0a%3c in later, it should be sown thinly, to prevent it from being suf¬ %0a%3c focated. There is a certain degree of skill, too, required in %0a%3c scattering the seed evenly ; to ensure this, the hand must keep %0a%3c time®® with the step, moving always with the right foot. %0a%3c There are certain persons, also, who have a secret method®’ of %0a%3c their own, having been born®'^ with a happy hand which im¬ %0a%3c parts fruitfulness to the grain.

Where the soil is rich, the pro¬ %0a%3c portion must be greater, where it is thin, less.®® %0a%3c %0a%3c There is another distinction, too, to be made; where the %0a%3c soil is dense, cretaceous, or moist, there should be six modii of %0a%3c wheat or winter-wheat to the jugerum, hut where the land is %0a%3c loose, dry, and prolific, four will be enough. A meagre soil, %0a%3c too, if the crop is not very thinly sown, will produce a dimi¬ %0a%3c nutive, empty ear. Rich lands give a number of stalks to each %0a%3c grain, and yield a thick crop from only a light sowing. The %0a%3c result, then, is, that from four to six modii must be sown, %0a%3c according to the nature of the soil ; though there are some %0a%3c who make it a rule that five modii is the proper proportion for %0a%3c sowing, neither more nor less, whether it is a densely-planted %0a%3c locality, a declivitj', or a thin, meagre soil.

This is a question that depends in %0a%3c a very great degree upon the stars; and I shall therefore make %0a%3c it my first care to set forth all the opinions that have been %0a%3c written in reference to the subject. Hesiod, the first writer %0a%3c who has given any precepts upon agriculture, speaks of one %0a%3c period only for sowing—the setting of the Vergili® : but then %0a%3c he wrote in Boeotia, a country of Hellas, where, as we have %0a%3c already stated,^ they are still in the habit of sowing at that %0a%3c period. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is generally agreed by the most correct writers, that with %0a%3c » the earth, as with the birds and quadrupeds, there are certain %0a%3c impulses for reproduction; and the epoch for this is fixed by %0a%3c the Greeks at the time when the earth is warm and moist. %0a%3c VirgiP says that wheat and spelt should be sown at the setting %0a%3c of the Vergili®, barley between the autumnal equinox and %0a%3c the winter solstice, and vetches,® kidney-beans, and lentils at %0a%3c the setting of Bootes P it is of great importance, therefore, %0a%3c to ascertain the exact days of the rising and setting of these %0a%3c constellations, as well as of the others. There are some, again, %0a%3c who recommend the sowing to be done before the setting of %0a%3c the Vergili®, hut only in a dry soil, and in those provinces %0a%3c where the weather is hot; for the seed, they say,® if put in the %0a%3c ground will keep, there being no moisture to spoil it, and %0a%3c within a single day after the next fall of rain, will make its %0a%3c appearance above ground. Others, again, are of opinion that %0a%3c sowing should begin about seven days after the setting of the %0a%3c Vergili®, a period which is mostly followed by rain. Some %0a%3c think that cold soils should be sown immediately after the %0a%3c autumnal equinox, and a warm soil later, so that the blade %0a%3c may not put forth too luxuriantly before winter. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is universally agreed, however, that the sowing should %0a%3c %0a%3c 1 In c. 8 of this Book. 2 Georg, i. 208. %0a%3c %0a%3c 3 Georg, i. 227 4 See c. 74 of this Book. %0a%3c %0a%3c ® Columella, B. ii. e. 8. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 66.] THE PROPER TIMES FOR SOWING. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 73 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c not be done about the period of the winter solstice ; for this %0a%3c very good reason—the winter seeds, if put in before the %0a%3c winter solstice, will make their appearance above ground on %0a%3c the seventh day, whereas, if they are sown just after it, they %0a%3c will hardly appear by the fortieth. There are some, however, %0a%3c who begin very earlj', and have a saying to justify their doing %0a%3c so, to the effect that if seed sown too early often disappoints, %0a%3c seed put in too late always does so. On the other hand, again, %0a%3c there are some who maintain that it is better to sow in %0a%3c spring than in a bad autumn ; and they say that if they find %0a%3c themselves obliged to sow in spring, they would choose the %0a%3c period that intervenes between the prevalence of the west %0a%3c winds® and the vernal equinox. Some persons, however, take %0a%3c no notice of the celestial phenomena, and only regulate their %0a%3c movements by the months. In spring they put in flax, the %0a%3c oat, and the poppy, up to the feast of the Quinquatria,’ as we %0a%3c find done at the present day by the people of Italy beyond the %0a%3c Padus. There, too, they sow beans and winter-wheat in the %0a%3c month of November, and spelt at the end of September, up %0a%3c to the ides of October others, however, sow this last after %0a%3c the ides of October, as late as the calends of November.® %0a%3c %0a%3c The persons who do this take no notice, consequently, of the %0a%3c phaenomena of Nature, while others, again, lay too much stress %0a%3c upon them, and hence, by these refined subtleties and dis¬ %0a%3c tinctions, only add to their blindness; for here are ignorant %0a%3c rustics, not only dealing with a branch of learning, but that %0a%3c branch astronomy ! It must stiU, however, be admitted that %0a%3c the observation of the heavens plays a very important part in %0a%3c the operations of agriculture ; and Virgil,^® we find, gives it as %0a%3c his advice, that before any thing else, we should learn the %0a%3c theory of the winds, and the revolutions of the stars; for, as he %0a%3c says, the agriculturist, no less than the mariner, should regu¬ %0a%3c late his movements thereby. It is an arduous attempt, and %0a%3c almost beyond all hope of success, to make an endeavour to in¬ %0a%3c troduce the divine science of the heavens to the uninformed %0a%3c %0a%3c * Favonius.

(25.) -AKKANGEMENT OF THE STAES ACCOEDING TO TEE %0a%3c %0a%3c TEllKESTBIAL DAYS AND NIGHTS. %0a%3c %0a%3c In the first place, it is almost an utter impossibility to cal¬ %0a%3c culate with a fair degree of accuracj'^ the days of the jmar and %0a%3c the movements of the sun. To the three hundred and sixty- %0a%3c five days there are still to be added the intercalary days, the %0a%3c result of the additional quarters of a day and night: hence it %0a%3c is, that it is found impossible to ascertain Avith exactness the %0a%3c proper periods for the appearance of the stars. To this we %0a%3c must add, too, a certain degree of uncertainty connected with %0a%3c these matters, that is universally admitted; thus, for instance, %0a%3c bad and wintry weather will often precede, b)" sev'eral days, %0a%3c the proper period for the advent of that season, a state of things %0a%3c known to the Greeks as while at another time, %0a%3c %0a%3c it will last longer than usual, a state of circumstances known as %0a%3c The effects, too, of the changes that take place %0a%3c in the seasons will sometimes be felt later, and at other times %0a%3c earlier, upon their reaching the face of the earth ; and we not %0a%3c unfrequently hear the remark made, upon the return of fine %0a%3c weather, that the action of such and such a constellation is %0a%3c now completed.'^ And then, again, as all these phcenomena de¬ %0a%3c pend upon certain stars, arranged and regulated in the vault of %0a%3c heaven, Ave find intervening, in accordance with the movements %0a%3c of certain stars, hailstorms and showers, themselves productive %0a%3c of no slight results, as we have already observed,^'* and apt to %0a%3c interfere with the anticipated regular recurrence of the seasons. %0a%3c !Nor are we to suppose that these disappointments fall upon the %0a%3c human race only, for other animated beings, as well as ourseh'es, %0a%3c %0a%3c “ “ To be an early winter.” “ To be a long winter.” %0a%3c %0a%3c 13 Confectum sidus. n In B. xvii. c. 2. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 57.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c AUKAKGfiilEXr OF THE STARS. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 75 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c are deceived in regard to them, although endowed with even a %0a%3c greater degree of sagacity upon these points than we are, from %0a%3c the fact of their very existence depending so materially upon %0a%3c them. Hence it is, that we sometimes see the summer birds %0a%3c killed by too late or too early cold, and the winter birds by %0a%3c heat coming out of the usual season. It is for this reason, %0a%3c that Virgilhas recommended us to study the courses of the %0a%3c planets, and has particularly warned us to watch the passage %0a%3c of the cold star Saturn. %0a%3c %0a%3c There are some who look upon the appearance of the butter¬ %0a%3c fly as the surest sign of spring, because of the extreme delicacy %0a%3c of that insect. In this present j^ear,^® however, in which I %0a%3c am penning these lines, it has been remarked that the flights %0a%3c of butterflies have been killed three several times, by as many %0a%3c returns of the cold ; while the foreign birds, which brought %0a%3c us by the sixth of the calends of February ” every indication %0a%3c of an early spring, after that had to struggle against a winter %0a%3c of the greatest severity. In treating of these matters, we have %0a%3c to meet a twofold difficulty: first of all, we have to ascertain %0a%3c whether or not the celestial phaenomena are regulated by %0a%3c certain laws, and then we have to seek how to reconcile those %0a%3c laws with apparent facts. We must, however, be more par¬ %0a%3c ticularly careful to take into account the convexity of the earth, %0a%3c and the differences of situation in the localities upon the face %0a%3c of the globe; for hence it is, that the same constellation shows %0a%3c itself to different nations at different times, the result being, %0a%3c that its influence is by no means perceptible everywhere at the %0a%3c same moment. This difficulty has been considerably enhanced, %0a%3c too, by various authors, who, after making their observations %0a%3c in different localities, and indeed, in some instances, in the same %0a%3c locality, have yet given us varying or contradictory results. %0a%3c %0a%3c There have been three great schools of astronomy, the Chal- %0a%3c daean, the ^Egyptian, and the Grecian. To these has been %0a%3c added a fourth school, which was established by the. Dictator %0a%3c Caesar among ourselves, and to which was entrusted the duty %0a%3c of regulating the year in conformity with the sun’s revolution,** %0a%3c under the auspices of Sosigenes, an astronomer of considerable %0a%3c learning and skill. His theory, too, upon the discovery of cer¬ %0a%3c tain errors, has since been corrected, no intercalations having %0a%3c %0a%3c ** Georg L 335. >6 a.u.c. 830. %0a%3c %0a%3c ** Twehly-seveuth of January. is gojig cursum.. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 76 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c flint’s natueal history. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XVIIT. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c been made for twelvesuccessive years, upon its being found %0a%3c that the year which before had anticipated the constellations, %0a%3c was now beginning to fall behind them. Even Sosigenes him¬ %0a%3c self, too, though more correct than his predecessors, has not %0a%3c hesitated to show, by his continual corrections in the three %0a%3c several treatises which he composed, that he still entertained %0a%3c great doubts on the subject. The writers, too, whose names are %0a%3c inserted at the beginning of this work,*® have sufficiently re¬ %0a%3c vealed the fact of these discrepancies, the opinions of one being %0a%3c rarely found to agree with those of another. This, however, %0a%3c is less surprising in the case of those whose plea is the difference %0a%3c of the localities in which they wTote. But with reference to %0a%3c those who, though living in the same country, have still arrived %0a%3c at different results, we shall here mention one remarkable %0a%3c instance of discrepancy. Hesiod—for under his name, also, %0a%3c we have a treatise extant on the Science of the Stars *‘—has %0a%3c stated that the morning setting of the Vergiliae takes place at %0a%3c the moment of the autumnal equinox; whereas Thales, we %0a%3c find, makes it the twenty-fifth day after the equinox, Anaxi¬ %0a%3c mander the twenty-ninth, and Euctemon the forty-eighth. %0a%3c %0a%3c As for ourselves, we shall follow the balculations made b}'^ %0a%3c Julius Caesar,** which bear reference more particularly to Italy; %0a%3c though at the same time, we shall set forth the dicta of various %0a%3c other writers, bearing in mind that we are treating not of an %0a%3c individual country, but of Nature considered in her totality. %0a%3c In doing this, however, we shall name, not the writers them¬ %0a%3c selves, for that would be too lengthy a task, but the countries %0a%3c in reference to 'wffiich they speak. The reader must bear in %0a%3c mind, then, that for the sake of saving space, under the head %0a%3c of Attica, we include the islands of the Cyclades as well; under %0a%3c that of Macedonia, Magnesia and Thracia; under that of Egypt, %0a%3c %0a%3c Soon after the corrections made by order of Julius Csesar, the Pon- %0a%3c tifices mistook the proper method of intercalation, by making it every %0a%3c third year instead of the fourth; the consequence of which was, that %0a%3c Augustus was obliged to correct the results of their error by omitting the %0a%3c intercalary day for twelve years. %0a%3c %0a%3c He most probably refers to the list of writers originally appended to %0a%3c the First Book; but which in the present Translation is distributed at the %0a%3c cud of each Book.

By taking the circular parallels %0a%3c which we have there appended to the several portions of the %0a%3c earth respective!)’-, and applying them to the countries in ques¬ %0a%3c tion, that are similarly situate, it will be foimd that the rising %0a%3c of the heavenly bodies will be the same for all parts -within %0a%3c those parallels, where the shadows projected are of equal length. %0a%3c It is also deserving of remark, that the seasons have their %0a%3c periodical recurrences, without any marked difference, ever)* %0a%3c four years, in consequence of the influence “ of the sun, and that %0a%3c the characteristics of the seasons are developed in excess every %0a%3c eighth year, at the revolution of every hundredth moon. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 58. —THE RISING AND SETTING OF THE STABS. %0a%3c %0a%3c The whole of this system is based upon the observation of %0a%3c three branches of the heavenly phsenomena, the rising of the %0a%3c constellations, their setting, and the regular recurrence of the %0a%3c seasons. These risings and settings may be observed in two %0a%3c different ways :—The stars are either concealed, and cease to %0a%3c be seen at the rising of the sun, or else present themselves to %0a%3c our view at his setting —this last being more generally known %0a%3c by the name of “ emersion ” than of “ rising,” while their dis- %0a%3c %0a%3c “ J. e.

In addition to this, there are certain stars %0a%3c which rise and set twice.^ All that we here state beai’s refer¬ %0a%3c ence, it must be remembered, to the fixed stars only. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 59. -THE EPOCHS OP THE SEASONS. %0a%3c %0a%3c The year is divided into four periods or seasons, the recurrence %0a%3c of which is indicated by the increase or diminution of the %0a%3c daylight. Immediately after the winter solstice the days begin %0a%3c to increase, and by the time of the vernal equinox, or in other %0a%3c words, in ninety days and three hours, the day is equal in %0a%3c length to the night. After this, for ninety-four days and %0a%3c twelve hours, the days continue to increase, and the nights to %0a%3c diminish in proportion, up to the summer solstice ; and from %0a%3c that point the days, though gradually decreasing, are still in %0a%3c excess of the nights for ninety-two days, twelve hours, until the %0a%3c autumnal equinox. At this period the days are of equal %0a%3c length with the nights, and after it they continue to decrease %0a%3c inversely to the nights until the winter solstice, a period %0a%3c of eighty-eight days and three hours. In all these calcu¬ %0a%3c lations, it must be remembered, equinoctiaP® hours are spoken %0a%3c of, and not those measured arbitrarily in reference to the %0a%3c length of any one day in particular.

Thus, for instance, between the summer %0a%3c solstice and the autumnal equinox, the setting of the Lyre,^* %0a%3c on the forty-sixth day, indicates the beginning of autumn; be¬ %0a%3c tween the autumnal equinox and the winter solstice, the morn¬ %0a%3c ing setting of the Vergilim, on the forty-fourth day, denotes %0a%3c the beginning of winter; between the winter solstice and the %0a%3c vernal equinox, the prevalence of the west winds on the forty- %0a%3c fifth day, denotes tlie commencement of spring ; and between %0a%3c the vernal equinox and the summer solstice, the morning rising %0a%3c of the Vergili®, on the forty-eighth day, announces the com¬ %0a%3c mencement of summer.

Xenophon^ is of opinion, that sowing %0a%3c should not be commenced until the Deity has given us the %0a%3c signal for it, a term by which Cicero understands the rains that %0a%3c prevail in November. The true method to be adopted, how¬ %0a%3c ever, is not to sow until the leaves begin to fall. Some per¬ %0a%3c sons are of opinion that this takes place at the setting of the %0a%3c %0a%3c In this Translation, the names of the Constellations are given in %0a%3c English, except in the case of the signs of the Zodiac, which are univer¬ %0a%3c sally known by their Latin appellations. %0a%3c %0a%3c *- He begins in c. 64, at the winter solstice, and omits the period be¬ %0a%3c tween the eleventh of November and the winter solstice altogether, so far %0a%3c as the mention of individual days. %0a%3c %0a%3c “ Cum sidus vehemens Orionis iisdcm diebus longo decedat spatio.” %0a%3c This passage is apparently unintelligible, if considered, as Sillig reads %0a%3c it, as dependent on the preceding one. %0a%3c %0a%3c In his (Ecouomica. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 80 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c flint’s natural HT8TOET. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XVIII. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Vergilise, or the third day before the ides of November, as %0a%3c already stated,^® and they carefully observe it, for it is a con¬ %0a%3c stellation very easily remarked in the heavens, and warns us %0a%3c to resume our winter clothes.®® Hence it is, that immediately %0a%3c on its setting, the approach of winter is expected, and care is %0a%3c taken by those who are on their guard against the exorbitant %0a%3c charges of the shop-keepers, to provide themselves with an %0a%3c appropriate dress. If the Vergiliae set with cloudy weather, %0a%3c it forebodes a rainy winter, and the prices of cloaks®’ imme¬ %0a%3c diately rise; but if, on the other hand, the weather is clear at %0a%3c that period, a sharp winter is to be expected, and then the %0a%3c price of garments of other descriptions is sure to go up. But %0a%3c as to the husbandman, unacquainted as he is with the phae- %0a%3c nomena of the heavens, his brambles are to him in place of %0a%3c constellations, and if he looks at the ground he sees it covered %0a%3c wdth their leaves. This fall of the leaves, earlier in one place %0a%3c and later in another, is a sure criterion of the temperature of %0a%3c the weather; for there is a great affinity between the effects %0a%3c produced by the weather in this respect, and the nature of the %0a%3c soil and climate. There is this peculiar advantage, too, in the %0a%3c careful observation of these effects, that they are sure to be %0a%3c perceptible throughout the whole earth, while at the same time %0a%3c they have certain features which are peculiar to each individual %0a%3c locality.—A person may perhaps be surprised at this, who does %0a%3c not bear in mind that the herb pennyroyal,®® which is hung up %0a%3c in our larders, always blossoms on the day of the winter sol¬ %0a%3c stice ; so firmly resolved is Nature that nothing shall remain %0a%3c concealed from us, and in that spirit has given us the fall of %0a%3c the leaf as the signal for sowing. %0a%3c %0a%3c Such is the true method of interpreting all these phsenomena, %0a%3c granted to us by Nature as a manifestation of her wiU. It %0a%3c is in this way that she warns us to prepare the ground, makes %0a%3c us a promise of a manure, as it were, in the fail of the leaves, %0a%3c announces to us that the earth and the productions thereof are %0a%3c thus protected by her against the cold, and warns us to hasten %0a%3c the operations of agriculture. %0a%3c %0a%3c In B. ii. c. 47. %0a%3c %0a%3c “ Vestis institor est.” This passage is probably imperfect. %0a%3c %0a%3c “Lacernarum.” ’^“Puleium.” See B. ii. c. 41 . %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 62.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c WOKK Fon FACU MONTH, %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 81 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 61.- wnF.N lO sow the xegusitnocs plants and the %0a%3c %0a%3c POPPi'. %0a%3c %0a%3c Varro^® has given no other sign but this^® for our guidance %0a%3c in sowing the bean.

Some sa}', however, that %0a%3c it wanted for fodder, they may be sown at these periods, but %0a%3c if for seed, in the spring. There is another sign, more evident %0a%3c still, supplied us b)" the marvellous foresight of I^ature, w'ith %0a%3c reference to which we will give the words employed by Cicero %0a%3c himself: %0a%3c %0a%3c “ The lentisk, ever green and ever oent %0a%3c beneath its fruits, affords a tltreofold crop: %0a%3c %0a%3c Thrice teeming, tlirice it warns us when to plough.” %0a%3c %0a%3c One of the periods here alluded to, is the same that is now %0a%3c under consideration, being the appropriate time also for sowing %0a%3c flax and the poppy.'*® With reference to this last, Cato gives the %0a%3c following ad vice : ‘‘Burn, upon land where corn has been grown, %0a%3c the twigs and branches wdiich are of no use to you, and. when %0a%3c that is done, sow the poppy there.” The wild’ poppy, which %0a%3c is of an utilit)' that is quite marvellous, is boiled in honey as a %0a%3c remedy for diseases in the throat,"® while the cultivated kind is %0a%3c a powerful narcotic.

He is summoned to the commencement of these %0a%3c labours, not upon the day on which the west winds ought to %0a%3c begin, but upon the day on which they really do begin, to blow. %0a%3c This moment then must be looked for with the most careful %0a%3c attention, as it is a signal Avhich the Deity has vouchsafed us %0a%3c in this month, attended with no doubts or equivocations, if %0a%3c only looked for with scrupulous care.

It is a much %0a%3c better plan, beyond a doubt, to plough such soils as these in %0a%3c autumn. %0a%3c %0a%3c Cato’’lays down the following rules for the operations or %0a%3c spring. “Ditches,” he saj's, “should be dug in the seed- %0a%3c jilots, vines should be grafted, and the elm, tlie fig, the olive, %0a%3c aud other fruit-trees planted in dense and humid soils. Such %0a%3c meadows’® as are not irrigated, must be manured in a dry %0a%3c moon, jirotected from the western blasts, and carefully cleaned ; %0a%3c noxious weeds must be rooted up, fig-trees cleared, new seed-' %0a%3c jilots made, and the old ones dressed : all this should be done %0a%3c before you begin to hoe the vineyard. When the pear is in %0a%3c blossom, too, you should begin to plough, Avhere it is a meagre, %0a%3c gravelly soil. When you have done all this, you may plough %0a%3c the more heavy, watery soils, doing this the last of all.” %0a%3c %0a%3c The proper time for ploughing, then,” is denoted by these %0a%3c two signs, the earliest fruit of the lentisk ®® making its appear¬ %0a%3c ance, aud the blossoming of the pear. There is a third sign, %0a%3c liowever, as well, the flowering of the squill among the bul- %0a%3c hous,®‘ and of the narcissus among the garland, plants. For %0a%3c . both the squill and the narcissus, as well as the lentisk, flower %0a%3c three times, denoting by their first flowering the first period %0a%3c for ploughing, by the second flowering the second, and by the %0a%3c third flowering the last; in this Avay it is that one thing affords %0a%3c hints for another. There is one precaution, too, that is by no %0a%3c means the least important among them all, not to let ivj’ touch %0a%3c the bean while in blossom; for at this period the ivy is noxious®' %0a%3c to it, and most baneful in its effects. Some plants, again, %0a%3c afford certain signs which bear reference more particularly to %0a%3c themselves, the fig for instance ; Avhen a few leaves only are %0a%3c found shooting from the summit, like a cup in shape, then it is %0a%3c more particularly that the fig-tree should be planted. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 66.—AVORK TO BE DONE AFTER THE VERNAL EQUINOX. %0a%3c %0a%3c The vernal equinox appears to end on the eighth day be- %0a%3c %0a%3c “ he Re Rust. 40.

On the fourteenth before ®® the calends of May, %0a%3c the Suculae set to the people of Egypt in the evening, a stormy %0a%3c constellation, and significant of tempests both by land and sea. %0a%3c This constellation sets on the sixteenth®® in Attica, and on the %0a%3c fifteenth, according to Caesar, announcing four days of bad %0a%3c weather in succession : in Assyria it sets upon the twelfth®* %0a%3c before the calends of May. This constellation has ordinarilj- the %0a%3c name of Parilicium, from the circumstance that the eleventh ®® %0a%3c before the calends of Maj’ is observed as the natal day of the %0a%3c City of Rome; upon this day, too, fine weather generally re¬ %0a%3c turns, and gives us a clear sky for our observations. The %0a%3c Greeks call the Suculae by the name of “Hyades,”®® in conse¬ %0a%3c quence of the rain and clouds which they bring with them; %0a%3c while our people, misled by the resemblance of the Greek name %0a%3c to another word®^ of theirs, meaning a "pig,” have imagined %0a%3c that the constellation receives its name from that word, and %0a%3c have consequently given it, in their ignorance, the name of %0a%3c " Suculae,” or the “ Little Pigs.” %0a%3c %0a%3c In the calculations made by Caesar, the eighth ®® before the %0a%3c calends of May is a day remarked, and on the seventh®® before %0a%3c the calends, the constellation of the Kids rises in Egypt. On %0a%3c the sixth before ®'' the calends, the Dog sets in the evening in %0a%3c Boeotia and Attica, and the Lyre rises in the morning.

Hence it is, too, that we find %0a%3c those cutting jokes,® of wliich our peasantry are the object, at %0a%3c the beginning of spring. Still, however, all such jokes are to %0a%3c be looked upon as most abominable, from the ill omens ® they %0a%3c convey. %0a%3c %0a%3c In this way, then, we see that, in agricultural operations, %0a%3c Ihe most trifling things are construed as so many hints supplied %0a%3c us by Nature. The latter part of this period is the proper %0a%3c time for sowing panic and millet; the precise moment, how¬ %0a%3c ever, is just after the barley has ripened. In the case of the %0a%3c very same land, too, there is one sign that points in common %0a%3c both to the ripening of the barley and the sowing of panic and %0a%3c millet—the appearance of the glow-worm, shining in the fields %0a%3c at night. “ Cicindelae is the name given by the country %0a%3c people to these flying stars, while the Greeks call them “ 1am- %0a%3c pyrides,”—another manifestation of .the incredible bounteous¬ %0a%3c ness of Nature. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 67.

We will here give another %0a%3c sign, which tells us when the cold is gone; as soon as ever %0a%3c you see the mulberry ® in bud, you have no occasion to fear any %0a%3c injury from the rigour of the weather. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is the time, now, to put in cuttings of the olive, to clear %0a%3c away between the olive-trees, and, in the earlier days of the %0a%3c equinox, to irrigate the meadows. As soon, however, as the %0a%3c grass puts forth a stem, you must shut off the water from the %0a%3c fields.® You must now lop the leafy branches of the vine, it %0a%3c being the rule that this should be done as soon as the branches %0a%3c have attained four fingers in length ; one labourer will be suf¬ %0a%3c ficient for a jugerum. Tlie crops of corn, too, should be hoed %0a%3c over again, an operation which lasts twenty days.

Sheep, too, are %0a%3c sheared at this period, lupines turned up for manuring the %0a%3c land, the ground dug, vetches cut for fodder, and beans gathered %0a%3c in and threshed. %0a%3c %0a%3c (28.) About the calends of June*® the meadows are mown ; %0a%3c the cultivation of which, the one which is the easiest of all, %0a%3c and requires the smallest outlay, leads me to enter into some %0a%3c further details relative to it. Meadow lands should be selected %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c in a rich, or else a moist or ivell-watered, soil, and care should %0a%3c be taken to drain the rain-water upon them from the high¬ %0a%3c road. The best method of ensuring a good crop of grass, is %0a%3c first to plough the land, and then to harrow it: but, before %0a%3c passing the harrow over it, the ground should be sprinkled %0a%3c with such seed as may have fallen from the ha}' in the hay¬ %0a%3c lofts and mangers.

Care, too, %0a%3c should be taken, ever)' time the grass is cut, to pass the sickle %0a%3c over the ground, and so cut the aftermath which the mowers %0a%3c have left behind ; for it is a very bad plan to leave any of the %0a%3c grass and let it shed its seed there. The best crop for meadow %0a%3c land is trefoil,^" and the next best is grass nuramulus-^ is %0a%3c the very worst of all, as it bears a pod which is particularly %0a%3c injurious; equisaetis,^“ too, which derives its name from its %0a%3c resemblance to horse-hair, is of a noxions character. The pro- %0a%3c j)er time for mowing grass is when the ear begins to shed its %0a%3c blossom and to grow strong: care must be taken to cut it %0a%3c before it becomes dry and parched. “Don’t mow your hay %0a%3c too late,” says Cato “but cut it before the seed is ripe.” %0a%3c Some persons turn the water upon it the day before mowing, %0a%3c where it is practicable to do so. It is the best plan to cut hay %0a%3c in the night while the dews are falling.^’ In some parts of %0a%3c Italy the mowing is not done till after harvest. %0a%3c %0a%3c This operation, too, was a very expensive one in ancient %0a%3c times. In those days the onlj'’ whetstones"® known were %0a%3c those of Crete and other places beyond sea, and they only used %0a%3c oil to sharpen the scythe with. For this purpose the mower %0a%3c moved along, with a horn, to hold the oil, fastened to his %0a%3c thigh. Italy has since furnished us with whetstones which are %0a%3c used with water, and give an edge to the iron quite equal to %0a%3c that imparted by the file; these water-whetstones, however, %0a%3c turn green very quickly. Of the scythe^® there are two va- %0a%3c %0a%3c Tlie varieties now known as Trifolium pratense, Trifoliuni rubens %0a%3c and Trifolium repens. %0a%3c %0a%3c “ Gramen.” Under this head, as Fee says, he probably includes the %0a%3c gramineous plants, known as Alopccurus, Phleum, Poa, Festuna, &o. %0a%3c %0a%3c Probably the Lysimaebia nummularia of Linnaeus, which has a ten¬ %0a%3c dency to corrode the lips of the sheep that pasture on it. %0a%3c %0a%3c Known to us as “horse-tail;” varieties of which are the Equisetum %0a%3c fluviatile and the Equisetum palustre of Linnaeus. %0a%3c %0a%3c De Re Rust. c. 53.

The Italian mowers %0a%3c cut with one hand onl}'. It is a fair day’s work for one man %0a%3c to cut a jugerum of grass, and for another to bind twelve hun¬ %0a%3c dred sheaves of four pounds each. When the grass is cut it %0a%3c should be turned towards the sun, and must never be stacked %0a%3c until it is quite dry. If this last precaution is not carefully %0a%3c taken, a kind of vapour will be seen arising from the rick in %0a%3c the morning, and as soon as the sun is up it will ignite to a %0a%3c certaint}'^, and so be consumed. When the grass has been cut, %0a%3c the meadow must be irrigated again, for the purpose of ensur¬ %0a%3c ing a crop in the autumn, known to us as the “cordum,” or %0a%3c aftermath. At Interamna in Umbria the grass is cut four %0a%3c times** a-year, and this although the meadows there are not %0a%3c irrigated,—in most places, three. After all this has been done, %0a%3c too, the pasturage of the land is found no less lucrative than %0a%3c the hay it has produced. This, however, is a matter of con¬ %0a%3c sideration for those more particularly who rear large herds of %0a%3c cattle, and every one whose occupation it is tp breed beasts of %0a%3c burden, will have his own opinions upon the subject: it is %0a%3c found, however, the most lucrative of all by those whose busi¬ %0a%3c ness it is to train chariot-horses. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 68.—THE SUMMER SOLSTICE. %0a%3c %0a%3c We have already stated** that the summer solstice arrives at %0a%3c the eighth degree of Cancer, and upon the eighth day before** %0a%3c the calends of July : this is an important crisis in the year, %0a%3c and of great interest to the Avhole earth. Up to this period %0a%3c from the time of the winter solstice the days have gone on %0a%3c increasing, and the sun has continued for six months making %0a%3c his ascension towards the north ; having now surmounted the %0a%3c heights of the heavens, at this point he reaches the goal, and %0a%3c %0a%3c Similar in shape to our sickle, or reaping hook, no doubt. %0a%3c %0a%3c “ Majoris compendii.” Similar to our reaping-hook, also.

And it is not the leaves of trees only that are %0a%3c wild and far remote that do this, nor have those persons who %0a%3c are on the look-out for these signs to go into devious forests %0a%3c and mountain tracts to seek them. Nor yet, on the other %0a%3c hand, are they to be seen in the leaves of trees only that are %0a%3c grown in the vicinity of cities or reared by the hand of the %0a%3c ornamental gardener, although in them they are to be seen %0a%3c as well. Nature upon this occasion turns the leaf of the %0a%3c olive which meets us at every step; she turns the leaf of %0a%3c the linden, sought by us, as it is, for a thousand purposes ; %0a%3c she turns the leaf of the white poplar, too, wedded to the vine %0a%3c that grows upon its trunk. And still, for her, all this is not %0a%3c enough. " You have the elm,” she says, “reared for the sup¬ %0a%3c port of the vine, and the leaf of that I will make to turn as %0a%3c Avell. The leaves of this tree you have to gather for fodder, the %0a%3c leaves of the vine you prune away. Only look upon them, %0a%3c and there you behold the solstice p® they are now pointing %0a%3c towards a quarter of the heavens the reverse of that towards %0a%3c which they looked the day before. The twigs of the withy, %0a%3c that most lowly of trees, you employ for tying things without %0a%3c number. You are a head taller than it—I will make its %0a%3c leaves to turn round as well. Why complain, then, that you %0a%3c are but a rustic peasant ? It shall be no fault of mine if %0a%3c you do not understand the heavens and become acquainted %0a%3c with the movements of the celestial bodies.

Upon the %0a%3c morning of the same day, also, the scorching constellation of %0a%3c Procyon rises. This last constellation has no name with the %0a%3c Romans, unless, indeed, we would consider it as identical with %0a%3c Canicula,®® or Lesser Dog, which we tiud depicted among %0a%3c the stars ; this last is productive of excessive heat, as we shall %0a%3c shortly have further occasion to state. On the fourth^®^beforo %0a%3c the nones of July, the Crown sets in the morning to the people %0a%3c of Chaldtea, and in Attica, the w'hole of Orion has risen by %0a%3c that day. On the day beforethe ides of July, the rising ot %0a%3c Orion ends to the Egyptians also; on the sixteenth before %0a%3c the calends of August, Procyon rises to the people of Assyria, %0a%3c and, the day but one after, of nearly all other countries as well, %0a%3c indicating a crisis that is universally known among all nations, %0a%3c and which by us is called the rising of the Dog-star ; the sun %0a%3c at this period entering the first degree of Leo. The Dog-star %0a%3c rises on the twenty-third day after the summer solstice; the %0a%3c influence of it is felt by both ocean, and earth, and even by many %0a%3c of the animals as well, as stated by us elsewhere on the appro¬ %0a%3c priate occasions.^® No less veneration, in fact, is paid to this %0a%3c star, than to those that ai'e consecrated to certain gods; it %0a%3c Lindles the flames of the sun, and is one great source of the %0a%3c heats of summer. %0a%3c %0a%3c On the thirteenth day before the calends of August, the %0a%3c Eagle sets in the morning to the people of Egypt, and tlie %0a%3c breezes that are the precursors of the Etesian winds, begin to %0a%3c blow; these, according to Caesar, are fii’st perceived in Italy, %0a%3c on the tenth before the calends of August. The Eagle sets %0a%3c in the morning of that day to the people of Attica, and on the %0a%3c %0a%3c Twenty-sixth of June. Fourth of July. %0a%3c %0a%3c There is some confusion, apparently, here.

Jt is %0a%3c at this period that the grapes are said to be charred,®'’ a blight %0a%3c falling upon them which burns them away, as though red-hot %0a%3c coals had been applied to them. There is no hail that can be %0a%3c compared with this destructive malady, nor yet any of those %0a%3c tempests, wliich have been productive of such scarcity and %0a%3c dearth. For the evil effects of these, at the very utmost, are %0a%3c only felt in isolated districts, while the coal blight,®’ on the other %0a%3c hand, extends over whole countries, far and wide. Still, how¬ %0a%3c ever, the remedy would not be very difficult, were it not that %0a%3c men would mucli rather calumniate Nature, than help them¬ %0a%3c selves.

At a %0a%3c more recent period, again, Sextius,'” a Homan philosopher re¬ %0a%3c siding at Athens, made a similar application of his knowledge. %0a%3c Such, then, is the utility of science, the instruction provided %0a%3c by which it shall be my aim, as clearly and as perspicuously %0a%3c os possible, to apply to the various occupations ot a country %0a%3c life. %0a%3c %0a%3c Most writers have said that it is the dew, scorched by a %0a%3c burning sun, that is the cause of mildew ** in corn, and of coal- %0a%3c blight in the vine; this, however, seems to me in a great %0a%3c measure incorrect, and it is my opinion that all blights result %0a%3c entirely from cold, and that the sun is productive of no injurious %0a%3c effects whatever. This, in fact, will be quite evident, if only a %0a%3c little attention is paid to the subject; for we find that the blight %0a%3c makes its apj)earance at first in the night time only, and before %0a%3c the sun has shone with any vigour. The natural inference is, %0a%3c that it depends entirely upon the moon, and more particularly %0a%3c as such a calamity as this is never known %3c:o happen except at the %0a%3c moon’s conjunction, or else at the full moon, periods at which %0a%3c the influence of that heavenly bod)' is at its greatest height. %0a%3c For at both of these periods, as already*® stated by us more %0a%3c than once, the moon is in reality at the full; though during %0a%3c her conjunction she throws back to the heavens all the light %0a%3c w'hich she has received from the sun. The difference in the %0a%3c effects produced by the moon at these two periods is very great, %0a%3c though at the same time equally apparent; for at the conjunc¬ %0a%3c tion, that body is extremely hot in summer, but cold in win¬ %0a%3c ter; while, on the other hand, at the full moon, the nights are %0a%3c cold in summer, but warm in winter. The reason of thi.'i, %0a%3c although Fabianus and the Greek writers adopt another me¬ %0a%3c thod of explaining it, is quite evident. During the moon’s %0a%3c conjunction in summer, she must of necessity move along with %0a%3c the sun in an orbit nearer to the earth, and so become warmed %0a%3c %0a%3c Mentioned by Seneca, Ep. 59. %0a%3c %0a%3c ** It was reserved for the latter part of the last century to discover that %0a%3c 7'iildew operated on vegetation through the medium of minute, parasitical %0a%3c fungi.

In winter, again, at the time of the conjunction, %0a%3c she is farther off from us, the sun being also removed to a %0a%3c greater distance. On the other hand, again, when the moon %0a%3c is at the full in summer, she is more remote from the earth, %0a%3c and in opposition with the sun; while, in winter, she ap¬ %0a%3c proaches nearer to us at that period, by adopting the same %0a%3c orbit as at her conjunction in summer. Naturally humid her¬ %0a%3c self, as often as from her position she is cold, she congeals to %0a%3c an unlimited extent the dews which fall at that period of the %0a%3c year. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 69.— CAUSES OF STKUILITT. %0a%3c %0a%3c But we ought always to bear in mind, more particularly, %0a%3c that there are two varieties of evils that are inflicted upon the %0a%3c earth by the heavens. The first of these, known by us under %0a%3c the name of “ tempests,” comprehends hail-storms, hurricanes %0a%3c and other calamities of a similar nature ; when these take place %0a%3c at the full moon, they come upon us with additional intensity. %0a%3c These tempests take their rise in certain noxious constellations, %0a%3c as already stated by us on several occasions, Arcturus, for in¬ %0a%3c stance, Orion, and the Kids. %0a%3c %0a%3c The other evils that are thus inflict(!d upon us, supervene with %0a%3c a bright, clear sky, and amid the silence of tlie night, no one %0a%3c being sensible of them until we have perceived their effects. %0a%3c These dispensations are universal and of a totally different %0a%3c character from those previously mentioned, and have various %0a%3c names given to them, sometimes mildew, sometimes blast, and %0a%3c sometimes coal blight; but in all cases stei’ility is the infallible %0a%3c result. It is of these last that we have now to speak, entering %0a%3c into details which have not hitherto been treated of by any %0a%3c writer; and first of all we will explain the causes of them. %0a%3c %0a%3c (29.) Independently of the moon, there are two principal %0a%3c causes of these calamities, which emanate more particularly %0a%3c from two quarters of the heavens of but limited extent. On %0a%3c the one hand, the Vergiliae exercise an especial influence on our %0a%3c harvests, as it is with their rising that the summer begins, and %0a%3c with their setting, the winter; thus embracing, in the space of %0a%3c six months, the harvest, the vintage, and the ripening of all the %0a%3c vegetable productions. In addition to this, there is a circular %0a%3c tract in the heavens, quite visible to the human eye even, known %0a%3c %0a%3c VOL. IV. H %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 98 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c flint’s natural history. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Rook XVriT. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c as the Milky "Way. It is the emanations from this, flowing as %0a%3c it were from the breast, that supply their milky®^ nutriment to %0a%3c all branches of the vegetable world. Two constellations more %0a%3c particularly mark this circular tract, the Eagle in the north, %0a%3c and Canicula in the south ; of this last, we have already made %0a%3c mention in its appropriate place. This circle traverses also %0a%3c Sagittarius and Gemini, and passing through the centre of the %0a%3c sun, cuts the equinoctial line below, the constellation of the %0a%3c Eagle making its appearance at the point of intersection on %0a%3c the one side, and Canicula on the other. Hence it is that the %0a%3c influences of both these constellations develope themselves %0a%3c upon all cultivated lands ; it being at these points only that the %0a%3c centre of the sun is brought to correspond with that of the %0a%3c earth. If, then, at the moments of the rising and the setting %0a%3c of these constellations, the air, soft and pure, transmits these %0a%3c genial and milky emanations to the earth, the crops will thrive %0a%3c and ripen apace; but if, on the other hand, the moon, as al¬ %0a%3c ready®® mentioned, sheds her chilling dews, the bitterness there¬ %0a%3c of infuses itself into these milky secretions, and so kills the %0a%3c vegetation in its birth. The measure of the injury so inflicted %0a%3c on the earth depends, in each climate, upon the combination of %0a%3c the one or other of these causes; and hence it is that it is not %0a%3c felt in equal intensity throughout the whole earth, nor even pre¬ %0a%3c cisely at the same moment of time. We have already*® said %0a%3c that the Eagle rises in Italy on the thirteenth day®^ before the %0a%3c calends of January, and the ordinary course of Hature does %0a%3c not permit us before that period to reckon with any degree of %0a%3c certainty upon the fruits of the earth ; for if the moon should %0a%3c happen to be in conjunction at that time, it will be a necessary %0a%3c consequence, that all the winter fruits, as well as the early %0a%3c ones, will receive injury more or less. %0a%3c %0a%3c The life led by the ancients was rude and illiterate; still, %0a%3c as will be readily seen, the observations they made were not %0a%3c less remarkable for ingenuity than are the theories of the pre¬ %0a%3c sent day. With them there were three set periods for gather¬ %0a%3c ing in the produce of the earth, and it was in honour of these %0a%3c periods that they instituted the festive days, known as the %0a%3c %0a%3c An onomatic prejudice, as Fee says, solely founded on the peculiarity %0a%3c of the name. %0a%3c %0a%3c In the preceding Chapter. 59 preceding Chapter. %0a%3c %0a%3c 6 ® In B. xvi. c. 42. ei Twentieth of December. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 69.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c CAUSES OF STEEILrxr. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 99 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c liobigalia,®' the Florolia, and the Vinalia. The Hohigalia were %0a%3c established by Nunia in the fortietli year of his reign, and are %0a%3c still celebrated on the seventh day before the calends of May, %0a%3c as it is at this period that mildew®^ mostly makes its first at¬ %0a%3c tacks upon the growing corn. Varro fixes this crisis at the %0a%3c moment at which the sun enters the tenth degree of Taurus, %0a%3c in accordance with the notions that prevailed in his day : but %0a%3c the real cause is the fact, that thirty-one®^ days after the vernal %0a%3c equinox, according to the observations of various nations, the %0a%3c Dog-star sets betw'cen the seventh and fourth before the ca¬ %0a%3c lends of Ma)^ a constellation baneful in itself, and to appease %0a%3c which a young dog should first be sacrificed.®® The same people %0a%3c also, in the year of the City 513, instituted the Floralia, a %0a%3c festival held upon the fourth before®® the calends of May, in %0a%3c accordance with the oracular injunctions of the Sibyl, to secure %0a%3c a favourable season for the blossoms and flowers. Varro fixes %0a%3c this day as the time at which the sun enters the fourteenth %0a%3c degree of Taurus. If there should happen to be a full moon %0a%3c during the four days at this period, injury to the corn and all %0a%3c the plants that are in blossom, will be the necessary result. %0a%3c 'J’he First Vinalia, which in ancient times were established on %0a%3c the ninth before ®’ the calends of May, for the purpose of tast¬ %0a%3c ing®® the wines, have no signification whatever in reference to %0a%3c the fruits of the earth, any more than the festivals already %0a%3c mentioned have in reference to the vine and the olive; the %0a%3c germination of these last not commencing, in fact, till the %0a%3c rising of the Vergiliae, on the Sixth day before®* the ides of %0a%3c %0a%3c ®- Or festival in honour of Robigo, the Goddess of mildew, on the %0a%3c twenty-fifth of April.

Hardouin ob¬ %0a%3c serves, that it is abundantly proved from the ancient writers that it was %0a%3c the custom to sacrifice a puppy to Sirius, or tlie Dog-star, at the Robigalia. %0a%3c As Littre justly remarks, it would almost appear that Pliny intended, by %0a%3c his ambiguous language, to lead his readers into error. %0a%3c %0a%3c ®® Twenty-eighth of April.

For my %0a%3c part, I am of opinion that tlie eighth befoi’e the calends of %0a%3c July, the day of the summer solstice, must be a critical day, for %0a%3c a similar reason; and that the rising of the Dog-star, twenty- %0a%3c three days after the summer solstice, must be so too, in case %0a%3c the moon is then in conjunction ; for the excessive heat is pro¬ %0a%3c ductive of injurious effects, and the grape becomes prematurely %0a%3c ripened, shrivelled, and tough. Again, if there is a full moon %0a%3c on the fourth before’® the nones of Jill)^ when Canicula rises %0a%3c to the people of Egypt, or at least on the sixteenth be¬ %0a%3c fore the calends of August, when it risf's in Italy, it is pro¬ %0a%3c ductive of injurious results. The same is the case, too, from %0a%3c the thirteenth day before the calends of August, when the %0a%3c Eagle sets, to the tenth before’® the calends of that month. %0a%3c The Second Vinalia, which are celebrated on the fourteenth” %0a%3c before the calends of September, bear no reference to these in¬ %0a%3c fluences. Varro fixes them at the period at which the Lyre %0a%3c begins its morning setting, and says that this indicates the be¬ %0a%3c ginning of autumn, the day having been set apart for the pur¬ %0a%3c pose of propitiating the w-eather : at the present day, however, %0a%3c it is observed that the Lyre sets on the sixth before’® the ides %0a%3c of August. %0a%3c %0a%3c Within these periods there are exerted the sterilizing in¬ %0a%3c fluences of the heavens, though I am far from denying that %0a%3c they may be 'considerably modified by the nature of the locality, %0a%3c according as it is cold or hot. Still, however, it is sufficient for %0a%3c me to have demonstrated the theory ; the modifications of its re¬ %0a%3c sults depending, in a great degree, upon attentive observation. %0a%3c It is beyond all question too, that either one of these two causes %0a%3c %0a%3c In B. xvi. c. 42, and in c. 66 of this Book. %0a%3c %0a%3c Second of June.

And here it %0a%3c suggests itself how greatly we ought to admire the bounteous %0a%3c I)rovisions made for us by Nature ; for, in the first place, these %0a%3c calamitous results cannot by any possibility befall us every year, %0a%3c in consequence of the fixed revolutions of the stars; nor indeed, %0a%3c when they do happen, beyond a few nights in the year, and it %0a%3c may be easil)' known beforehand which nights those are likely %0a%3c to be. In order, too, that we might not have to apprehend these %0a%3c injuries to vegetation in all the months. Nature has so ordained %0a%3c that the times of the moon’s conjunction in summer, and of the %0a%3c full moon in winter, with the exception of two days only at %0a%3c those respective periods, are well ascertained, and that there is %0a%3c no danger to be apprehended on any but the nights of summer, %0a%3c and those nights the shortest of all; in the daj^-time, on the %0a%3c other hand, there is nothing to fear. And then, besides, these %0a%3c jthaenomena may be so easily understood, that the ant even, %0a%3c that most diminutive of insects, takes its rest during the moon’s %0a%3c conjunction, but toils on, and that during the night as well,when %0a%3c the moon is at the full; the bird, too, called the “parra”'* %0a%3c disappears upon the day on which Sirius rises, and never re¬ %0a%3c appears until that star has set; while the witwall,®“ on the %0a%3c other hand, makes its appearance on the day of the summer %0a%3c solstice. The moon, however, is productive of no noxious %0a%3c effects at either of these periods, except when the nights are %0a%3c clear, and every movement of the air is lulled ; for so long as %0a%3c clouds prevail, or the wind is blowing, the night' dews never %0a%3c fall. And then, besides, there are certain remedies to counter¬ %0a%3c act these noxious influences. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 70 . —KEMEDIES AGAINST THESE NOXTOOS INFLUENCES. %0a%3c %0a%3c When you have reason to fear these influences, make bon¬ %0a%3c fires in the fields and vineyards of cuttings or heaps of chaff, or %0a%3c else of the weeds that have been rooted up ; the smokewill %0a%3c act as a good preservative.

In other countries the stalks are cut %0a%3c M'ith the sickle in the middle, and the ears are separated by %0a%3c the aid of paddle-forks.®® In some places, again, the corn is %0a%3c torn up by the roots; and it is asserted by those who adopt %0a%3c this plan, that it is as good as a light turning up for the ground, %0a%3c whereas, in reality, the)’^ deprive it of its juices.®® There are %0a%3c differences in other respects also : in places where they thatch %0a%3c iheir houses with straw, they keep the longest haulms for that %0a%3c purpose ; and where hay is scarce, they employ the straw for %0a%3c litter. -The straw of panic is never used for thatching, and %0a%3c that of millet is mostly burnt; barley-straw, however, is %0a%3c always preserved, as being the most agreeable of all as a food %0a%3c for oxen. In the Gallic provinces panic and millet are gathered, %0a%3c ear by ear, with the aid of a comb carried in the hand. %0a%3c %0a%3c In some places the corn is beaten out by machines®* upon %0a%3c the threshing-floor, in others by the feet of mares, and in %0a%3c %0a%3c 3'* Palladius gives a long description of this contrivance, which seems to %0a%3c have been pushed forward by the ox; the teeth, which were sharp at the %0a%3c edge and fine at the point, catching the ears and tearing them off. But, %0a%3c as Fee says, the use of it must have been very disadvantageous, in conse¬ %0a%3c quence of the unequal height of the stalks. The straw, too, was sacrificed %0a%3c by the employment of it. %0a%3c %0a%3c In contrarium juncto. %0a%3c %0a%3c “ Merges.” Supposed to be the same as the “ hatillum” of Varro. %0a%3c Its form is unknown, and, indeed, the manner in which it was used. It is %0a%3c not improbable that it was a fork, sharp at the edge, and similar to an %0a%3c open pair of scissars, with which the heads of corn were driven off, as it %0a%3c were ; this, however, is only a mere conjecture. By the use of “ atque,” %0a%3c it would almost appear that the “merges” was employed after the sickle %0a%3c had been used; but it is more probable that he refers to two different me¬ %0a%3c thods of gathering the ears of corn. %0a%3c %0a%3c ** The roots and the stubble are, in reality, as good as a manure to the %0a%3c land. %0a%3c %0a%3c Called “ trihulum a threshing-machine moved by oxen.

The later wheat is cut, the more prolific* %0a%3c it is; but if it is got in early, the grain is finer and stronger. %0a%3c The best rule is to cut it before the grain liardens, and just %0a%3c as it is changing colour though the oracles on husbandr}' %0a%3c say that it is better to begin the harvest two daj's too soon %0a%3c than two days too late. Winter and other wheat must be %0a%3c treated exactly the same way both on the threshing-floor and %0a%3c in the granary. Spelt, as it is ditficult to be threshed, should %0a%3c be stored with the chaff on, being only disengaged of the straw %0a%3c and the beard. , %0a%3c %0a%3c Many countries make use of chaff* for hay; the smoother %0a%3c and thinner it is, and the more nearly resembling dust, the %0a%3c better ; hence it is that the chaff* of millet is considered the %0a%3c .best, that of barley being the next best, and that of wheat the %0a%3c Avorst of all, except for beasts that are hard worked. In stony %0a%3c ])laces they break the haulms, when dr}', with staves, for the %0a%3c cattle to lie upon: if there is a deficiency of chaff, the straw %0a%3c as well is ground for food. The following is the method em¬ %0a%3c ployed in prepai’ing it: it is cut early and sprinkled with bay %0a%3c salt,* after which it is dried and rolled up in trusses, and given %0a%3c to the oxen as wanted, instead of hay. Some persons set fire %0a%3c to the stubble in the fields, a plan that has been greatly ex¬ %0a%3c tolled by Virgil the chief merit of it is that the seed of the %0a%3c Aveeds is effectually destroyed. The diversity of the raethod.s %0a%3c employed in harvesting mainly depends upon the extent of the %0a%3c crops and the price of labour. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 73 -THE METHODS OF STORING CORN. %0a%3c %0a%3c Connected Avith this branch of our subject is the method of %0a%3c storing corn. Some persons recommend that granaries should %0a%3c be built for the purpose at considerable expense, the walls %0a%3c %0a%3c On the contrary, Fee says, the risk is greater from tlie depredations %0a%3c of birds, and the chance of the grain falling out in cutting, and gathering %0a%3c in. Spelt and rye may be left much longer than Avheat or oats. %0a%3c %0a%3c * Columella, B. ii. c. i., gives the same advice. %0a%3c %0a%3c “Palea” seems here to mean “chaff;" though Fee understands it %0a%3c as meaning stravr. %0a%3c %0a%3c The chaff of millet, and not the straw, must evidently be intended here, %0a%3c for he says above that the straw—“ culmus ”—of millet is generally burnt. %0a%3c %0a%3c * Muria dura. %0a%3c %0a%3c * Georg, i. 84, et seq.

Others, again, %0a%3c say that the granary should have an aspect in no direction hut %0a%3c the north-east or north, and that the walls should be built %0a%3c without lime, that substance being extremely injurious'' to %0a%3c corn ; as to Avhat Ave find recommended in reference toamurca %0a%3c of olives, Ave have already mentioned it on a former® occasion. %0a%3c In some places they build their granaries of wood, and upon %0a%3c pillars,® thinking it the best plan to leave access for the air on %0a%3c every side, and from below CAmn. Some persons think, how¬ %0a%3c ever, that the grain diminishes in bulk if laid on a floor above %0a%3c the lev^el of the ground, and that it is liable to ferment beneath %0a%3c a roof of tiles. Many persons say, too, that the grain should %0a%3c never be stirred up to air’ it, as the weevil is never known to %0a%3c penetrate beyond four fingers in depth ; consequent!)', beyond %0a%3c that depth there is no danger. According to Columella,® the %0a%3c Avest wind is beneficial to grain, a thing that surprises me, as %0a%3c that Avind is generally a A'ery parching® one. Some persons %0a%3c recommend that, before housing the corn, a bramble-frog %0a%3c should be hung up by one of the hind legs at the threshold of %0a%3c the granary. To me it appears that the most important pre¬ %0a%3c caution of all is to house the grain at the prpper time; for if %0a%3c it is unripe when cut, and not sufficiently firm, or if it is got %0a%3c in in a heated state, it follows of necessity that noxious in¬ %0a%3c sects will breed in it. %0a%3c %0a%3c There are several causes which contribute to the preserva¬ %0a%3c tion of grain; the outer'® coats in some kinds are more nu¬ %0a%3c merous, as in millet, for instance; the juices are of an olea¬ %0a%3c ginous nature," and so supply ample moisture, as in sesame, %0a%3c for example ; while in other kinds, again, they are naturally %0a%3c %0a%3c ^ Pall.adius, i. 19, says tico feet. %0a%3c %0a%3c * Oil account of the damp.

In barle)' the chatf is thinner, and the same is the %0a%3c case with all the leguminous seeds : it is for this reason that they %0a%3c do not ordinarily breed insects.

If garnered in the ear, grain is %0a%3c hardly ever found to suffer any injur)L %0a%3c %0a%3c The best plan, however, of preserving grain, is to lay it up %0a%3c in trenches, called “ siri,” as they do in Cappadocia, Thracia, %0a%3c Spain, and at * * * in Africa. Particular care is taken to %0a%3c dig these trenches in a dry soil, and a layer of chaff is then %0a%3c placed at the bottom ; the grain, too, is always stored in the %0a%3c ear. In this case, if no air is allo-wed to penetrate to the com, %0a%3c we may rest assured that no noxious insects will ever breed %0a%3c in it. Varro*® says, that wheat, if thus stored, will keep as %0a%3c long as fifty years, and millet a hundred ; and ho assures us %0a%3c that beans and other leguminous grain, if put away in oil jars %0a%3c with a covering of ashes, will keep for a great length of time. %0a%3c He makes a statement, also, to the effect that some beans were %0a%3c preserved in a cavern in Ambracia from the time of King %0a%3c Pyrrhus until the Piratical War of Pompeius Magnus, a period %0a%3c of about two hundred and twenty years. %0a%3c %0a%3c The chick-pea is the only grain in which no insect will %0a%3c breed while in the granary. Some persons place upon the %0a%3c heaps of the leguminous grains pitchers full of vinegar and %0a%3c coated with pitch, a stratum of ashes being laid beneath; and %0a%3c they fancy that if this is done, no injury will happen. Some, %0a%3c again, store them in vessels which have held salted provisions, %0a%3c ■with a coating of plaster on the top, ■wdiile other persons are %0a%3c %0a%3c *2 And so repel the attacks of insects. %0a%3c %0a%3c This would not only spoil the flavour, but absolutely injure the com %0a%3c as well. %0a%3c %0a%3c This also, if practised to any extent, would infallibly spoil the srain. %0a%3c %0a%3c >5 De Ke Rust. i. 37.

In these %0a%3c intervals, the more important periods are marked b}’- the rising %0a%3c of the Horse to the people of Attica, in the evening of the day %0a%3c before the ides of August; upon which day also the Dolphin %0a%3c sets in Egypt, and, according to Caesar, in Italy. On the %0a%3c eleventh before the calends of September, the star called the %0a%3c Vintager begins to rise in the morning, according to Caesar’s %0a%3c reckoning, and to the people of Assyria: it announces the %0a%3c ripening of the vintage, a sure sign of which is the change of %0a%3c colour in the grape. On the fifth before the calends of Sep¬ %0a%3c tember, the Arrow sets in Assyria, and the Etesian winds cease %0a%3c to blow : on the nones of September, the Vintager rises in %0a%3c Egypt, and in the morning of that day, Arcturus rises to the %0a%3c people of Attica: on the same morning, too, the Arrow sets. %0a%3c On the fifth before the ides of September, according to Caesar, %0a%3c the She-Ooat rises in the evening; and one half of Arcturus %0a%3c becomes visible on the day before*^ the ides of September, being %0a%3c portentous^ of boisterous weather for five days, both by land %0a%3c and sea. %0a%3c %0a%3c The theory relative to the effects produced by Arcturus, is %0a%3c stated in tbe following terms: if showers prevail, it is said, at %0a%3c the setting of the Dolphin, they wdll not cease so long as %0a%3c Arcturus is visible.

After the setting of the Lyre, Vetches should %0a%3c be sown, kidney-beans and hay-grass : it is generally recom¬ %0a%3c mended that this should he done wliile the moon is in con¬ %0a%3c junction. This, too, is the proper time for gathering in the %0a%3c leaves: it is fair work for one woodman, to fill four baskets ** %0a%3c in the day. If the leaves are gathered while the moon is on %0a%3c the wane, they will not decay; they ought not to he dry, %0a%3c however, when gathered. %0a%3c %0a%3c The ancients were of opinion, that the vintage is never ripe %0a%3c before the equinox ; but at the present day I find that it is %0a%3c gathered in before that period ; it ivill be as well, therefore, %0a%3c to give the signs and indications by which the proper moment %0a%3c may be exactly ascertained. The rules I'or getting in the vin¬ %0a%3c tage are to the following effect: Never gather the grape in a %0a%3c heated state,^® or in other words, when the weather is dry, and %0a%3c before the rains have fallen ; nor ought it to be gathered when %0a%3c covered with dew,—or in other words, when dews have fallen %0a%3c during the night,—nor yet before the dews have been dispelled %0a%3c by the sun. Commence the vintage when the bearing-shoots %0a%3c begin to recline upon the stem, or when, after a grape is re¬ %0a%3c moved from the bunch, the space left empty is not filled up; %0a%3c this being a sure proof that the berry has ceased to increase in %0a%3c size. It is of the greatest consequence to the grape, that it %0a%3c should he gathered while the rnoon is on the increase. Each %0a%3c pressing should fill twenty culei,^® that being the fair propor¬ %0a%3c tion. To fill twenty cuhu and vats '*'' from twenty jugera of %0a%3c vineyard, a single press will be enough. In pressing the grape, %0a%3c some persons use a single press-board, but it is a better plan %0a%3c %0a%3c In c. 3-5 of this Book. %0a%3c %0a%3c “ Frondarias fiscinas.” These must have been baskets of a very large %0a%3c size. The leaves were used for fodder. %0a%3c %0a%3c This, F’ee says, is diainetrieally opposite to the modern practice. %0a%3c %0a%3c The “ culeus,” it is supposed, was of the same measure of capacity as the %0a%3c •‘doliura,”and held twenty amphorae. Tlie “ pressura,” or “ pressing." was %0a%3c probably the utmost quantity that the pressing vat would hold at one time. %0a%3c %0a%3c *' “ Lacus.” %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 110 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c puny’s natural history. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Hook XVIII. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c to employ two, however large the single ones may be. It is tiie %0a%3c length of them that is of the greatest consecpience, and not tfie %0a%3c thickness : if wide, however, they press the fruit all the better. %0a%3c The ancients used to screw down the press-boards with ropes %0a%3c and leather thongs, worked by levers. Within the last hundred %0a%3c years the Gfeek press has been invented, with Giick spiral %0a%3c grooves running down the ■'® stem. To this stem there are %0a%3c spokes attached, which project like the rays of a star, and by %0a%3c means of which the stem is made to lift a box filled with stones %0a%3c —a method that is very highly approved of. It is only within %0a%3c the last two-and-twenty years, that a plan has been discovered %0a%3c of employing smaller press-boards, and a less unwieldy press: %0a%3c to effect this, the height has been reduced, and the stem of the %0a%3c screw placed in the middle, the whole pressure being concen¬ %0a%3c trated upon broad planks ■'® placed over the grapes, which are %0a%3c covered also with heavy weights above. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is the proper time forgathering fruit; the best moment %0a%3c for doing so is when it has begun to fall Ihrough ripeness, %0a%3c and not from the effects of the weather. This is the season, %0a%3c too, for extracting the lees of wine, and for boiling defrutum %0a%3c this last must be done on a night when there is no moon, or if %0a%3c it is a full moon, in the day-time. At other times of the year, %0a%3c it must he done either before the moon has risen, or after it %0a%3c has set. The grapes employed for this purpose should never %0a%3c be gathered from a young vine, nor yet from a tree that is %0a%3c grown in a marshy spot, nor should any grapes be used but %0a%3c those that are perfectlj'^ ripe : the liquor, too, should never be %0a%3c skimmed with anything but a leaf,®‘ for if the vessel should %0a%3c happen to be touched with wood, the liquor, it is generally %0a%3c thought, will have a burnt and smoky flavour. %0a%3c %0a%3c The pjroper time for the vintage is between the equinox and %0a%3c the setting of the Vergiliae, a period of forty-four days. It is %0a%3c a saying among the growers, that to pitch wine-vessels after %0a%3c that day, in consequence of the coldness of the weather, is only %0a%3c so much time lost. Still, however, I have seen, before now, %0a%3c persons getting in the vintage on the calends of January “ %0a%3c %0a%3c 18 o Mali rugis per cocleas bullantibus.” The whole of this passage is %0a%3c full of difficulties. %0a%3c %0a%3c 18 “ Tympanaliterally, “ drums.” %0a%3c %0a%3c 50 Grape juice boiled down to one half; see B. xiv. c. 9. %0a%3c %0a%3c 51 Virgil mentions this in the Georgies, B i. 29-5.

As %0a%3c for the other details relative to wines, they have been discussed %0a%3c at suflicient length already and it has been stated on a pre¬ %0a%3c vious occasion,® that as soon as the vintage is got in, the olives %0a%3c should at once be gathered, with other particulars relative %0a%3c to the olive after the setting of the Yergiliae. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 75.

Virgil® has even %0a%3c gone so far, in imitation of Democritus, as to assign certain %0a%3c operations to certain days® of the moon ; but my sole object %0a%3c sliall be, as, indeed, it has been throughout this work, to con¬ %0a%3c sult that utility Mdiich is based upon a knowledge and appre¬ %0a%3c ciation of general principles. %0a%3c %0a%3c All vegetable productions are cut, gathered, and housed to %0a%3c more advantage while the moon is on the wane than while it %0a%3c is on the increase. Manure must never be touched except %0a%3c when the moon is on the wane; and land must be manured %0a%3c more particularly while the moon is in conjunction, or else at %0a%3c the first quarter. Take care to geld your boars, bulls, rams, %0a%3c and kids, while the moon is on the wane. Put eggs under the %0a%3c hen at a new moon. Make your ditches in the night-time, %0a%3c when the moon is at full. Cover u]) the roots of trees, while %0a%3c the moon is at full.

It is generally recommended, too, to give an airing %0a%3c to corn and the leguminous grains, and to garner them, towards %0a%3c the end of the moon; to make seed-plots when the moon %0a%3c is above the horizon; and to tread out the grape, to fell tim¬ %0a%3c ber, and to do many other things that have be(‘n mentioned %0a%3c in their respective places, when the moon is below it. %0a%3c %0a%3c The observation of tbe moon, in general, as already ob¬ %0a%3c served in the Second Book,®^ is not so very easy, but what I %0a%3c am about here to state even rustics will be able to comprehend: %0a%3c so long as the moon is seen in the west, and during the earlier %0a%3c hours of the night, she will be on the increase, and one half %0a%3c of her disk will be j^erceived ; but when the moon is seen to %0a%3c rise at sun-set and opposite to the sun, so that they are both %0a%3c perceptible at the same moment, she will be at full. Again, %0a%3c as often as the moon rises in the east, and does not give her %0a%3c light in the earlier hours of the night, but shows herstdf %0a%3c during a portion of the day, she will be on the wane, and one %0a%3c half of her only will again be perceptible : when the moon has %0a%3c ceased to be visible, she is in conjunction, a period known to %0a%3c us as “ interlunium.”®“ During the conjunction, the moon will %0a%3c be above the horizon the same time as the sun, for the whole %0a%3c of the first day; on the second, she will advance iipon the %0a%3c night ten-twelfths of an hour and one-fourth of a twelfth %0a%3c on the third day, the same as on the second, and * * * so on %0a%3c in succession up to the fifteenth day, the same proportional parts %0a%3c of an hour being added each day. On the fifteenth day she will %0a%3c be above the horizon all night, and below it all day. On the %0a%3c sixteenth, she will remain below the horizon ten-twelfths of %0a%3c an hour, and one-fourth of a twelfth, at the first hour of the %0a%3c night, and so on in the same proportion day after day, up to %0a%3c the period of her conjunction ; and thus, the same time which, %0a%3c by remaining under the horizon, she withdraws from the first %0a%3c part of the night, she will add to the end of the night by %0a%3c remaining above the horizon. Her revolutions, too, will %0a%3c occupy thirty days one month, and twenty-nine the next, and %0a%3c so on alternately. Such is the theory of the revolutions of %0a%3c the moon. %0a%3c %0a%3c In Chapters 6. 7, 8 and 11. %0a%3c %0a%3c «%3c’ Or “between moons.” The “ change of the moon,” as we call it. %0a%3c %0a%3c *’ olj minutes. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Cbap. 76.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c THE TlIEOliY OF THE ’WINDS. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 113 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 76. (33.) -THE THEOEY OF THE ’W^INDS. %0a%3c %0a%3c The theory of the -winds®^ is of a somewhat more intricate %0a%3c nature. After observing the quarter in which the sun rises %0a%3c on any given day, at the sixth®^ hour of the day take your %0a%3c j)osition in such a manner as to have the point of the sun’s %0a%3c rising on your left; you will then have the south directly %0a%3c facing you, and the north at your back : a line drawn through %0a%3c a field in this dir(?ction®‘ is called the “cardinal”®® line. The %0a%3c observer must then turn round, so as to look upon his shadow, %0a%3c for it will be behind him. Having thus changed his position, %0a%3c so as to bring the point of the sun’s rising on that day to the %0a%3c right, and that of his setting to the left, it will be the sixth %0a%3c hour of the day, at the moment when the shadow straight %0a%3c before him is the shortest. Through the middle of this %0a%3c shadow, taken lengthwise, a furrow must be traced in the %0a%3c ground with a hoe, or else a line drawn with ashes, some %0a%3c twenty feet in length, say; in the middle of this line, or, in %0a%3c other words, at the tenth foot in it, a small circle must then %0a%3c be described: to this circle we may give the name of the %0a%3c “ umbilicus,” or “ navel.” That point in the line which lies %0a%3c on the side of the head of the shadow will be, the point from %0a%3c which the north wind blows. You who are engaged in prun¬ %0a%3c ing trees, be it your care that the incisions made in the wood %0a%3c do not face this point; nor should the vine-trees®® or the vines %0a%3c have this aspect, except in the climates of Africa,®’ Cyrenae, or %0a%3c Egypt. When the wind blows, too, from this point, you must %0a%3c never plough, nor, in fact, attempt any other of the operations %0a%3c of which we shall have to make mention.®® %0a%3c %0a%3c That part of the line which lies between the umbilicus and %0a%3c the feet of the shadow ■will look towards the south, and indi¬ %0a%3c cate the point from which the south wind®® blows, to which, %0a%3c as already mentioned,’® the Greeks have given the name of %0a%3c Notus. When the wind comes from this quarter, you, hus¬ %0a%3c bandman, must never fell wood or touch the vine.

In Italy the bearing branches should be trained to %0a%3c face this quarter, but the incisions made in the trees or vines %0a%3c when pruned must never face it. Let those be on their guard %0a%3c against this wind upon the four’^ days at the rising of the %0a%3c Vergiliaj, who are engaged in planting the olive, as well as %0a%3c those who are employed in the operations of grafting or ino¬ %0a%3c culating. %0a%3c %0a%3c It will he as well, too, here to give some advice, in reference %0a%3c to the climate of Ital}’’, as to certain precautions to be observed %0a%3c at certain hours of the day. You, woodman, must never lop %0a%3c the branches in the middle of the day; and you, shepherd, %0a%3c wLen you see midday approaching in summer, and the shadow %0a%3c gradually decreasing, drive your flocks from out of the sun %0a%3c into some well-shaded spot. When you lead the flocks to pas¬ %0a%3c ture in summer, let them face the west before midday,'’^ and %0a%3c after that time, the east: if this precaution is not adopted, %0a%3c calamitous results will ensue; the same, too, if the flocks are %0a%3c led in winter or spring to pastures covered with dew. Nor %0a%3c must you let them feed with their faces to the north, as already %0a%3c mentionedfor the wdnd will either close their eyes or else %0a%3c make them bleared, and they will die of looseness. If you wish %0a%3c to have females,''® you should let the dams have their faces to- %0a%3c ■w'ards the north while being covered. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 77. (34.)—THE LAYING OUT OF LANDS ACCORDING TO THE %0a%3c POINTS OF THE WIND. %0a%3c %0a%3c We have already stated^® that the umbilicus should be de¬ %0a%3c scribed in the middle of the line. Let another line be drawn %0a%3c transversely through the middle of it, and it will be found to %0a%3c run from due east to due west; a trench cut through the land %0a%3c in accordance with this line is known by the name of “ decu- %0a%3c inanus.” Two other lines must then be traced obliquely %0a%3c across them in the form of the letter X, in such a way as to %0a%3c %0a%3c Incendia. %0a%3c %0a%3c '* See B. xvii. c. 2. gge B. viii. c. 75. %0a%3c %0a%3c He seems to be in error here, as he has nowhere made mention of this. %0a%3c %0a%3c Aristotle, on the other hand, and Columella, B. vii. c. 3, say “ males." %0a%3c See also B. viii. c. 72, where males are mentioned in connection with tho %0a%3c north-wind. Also the next Chapter in this Book, %0a%3c %0a%3c In the last Chapter %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 77.] the laying out oe lakhs. llo %0a%3c %0a%3c run exactly from right and left of the northern point to left %0a%3c and right of the southern one. All these lines must pass %0a%3c tlirough the centre of the umbilicus, aud all must be of corre¬ %0a%3c sponding length, and at equal distances. This method should %0a%3c always be adopted in lajung out land; or if it should be found %0a%3c necessary to employ it irequently, a plan” of it may be made %0a%3c ill wood, sticks of equal length being fixed upon the surface %0a%3c of a small tambour,’** but perfectly round. In the method %0a%3c which I am here explaining, it is necessary to point out one %0a%3c precaution that must always be observed by those who are %0a%3c unacquainted with the subject. The point that must be veri¬ %0a%3c fied first of all is the south, as that is always the same; but %0a%3c the sun, it must be remembered, rises every daj- at a point in %0a%3c the heavens different to that of his rising on the day before, %0a%3c so that the east must never be taken as the basis for tracing %0a%3c the lines. %0a%3c %0a%3c Having now ascertained the various points of the heavens, %0a%3c the extremity of the line that is nearest to the north, but lying %0a%3c to the east of it, will indicate the solstitial rising, or, in other %0a%3c Avords, the rising of the sun on the longest day, as also the %0a%3c point from which the wind Aquilo’® blows, known to the Greeks %0a%3c by the name of Boreas. You should plant all trees and vines %0a%3c facing this point, but take care never to plough, or sow corn, %0a%3c or plant in seed plots, while this wind is blowing, for it has the %0a%3c effect of drying up and blasting the roots of the trees while %0a%3c being transplanted. Be taught in time—one thing is good for %0a%3c grown trees, another for them while they are but young. Hoi %0a%3c have I forgotten the fact, that it is at this point of the heavens %0a%3c that the Greeks place the wind, to which they give the name %0a%3c of Coecias; Aristotle, a man of most extensive learning, who %0a%3c has assigned to Caecias this position, explains that it is in con¬ %0a%3c sequence of the convexity of the earth, that Aquilo blows in %0a%3c an opposite direction to the wind called Africus. %0a%3c %0a%3c Tlie agriculturist, however, has nothing to fear from Aquilo, %0a%3c in respect to the operations before mentioned, all the year %0a%3c through; for this wind is softened by the sun in the middle of %0a%3c %0a%3c ” Very similar to our compass, but describing only eight points of %0a%3c the wind, instead of thirty two. %0a%3c %0a%3c 7» i* Tympanum,” a drum, similar in shape to our tambourines or else %0a%3c kettle-drums. %0a%3c %0a%3c See B. ii. c. 46. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 116 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Pliny’s natuual histoey. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XVIIl. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c the summer, and, changing its name, is known by that of Etc- %0a%3c sias.®® ^Tien you feel the cold, then, be on your guard; tor, %0a%3c whatever the noxious effects that are attributed to Aquilo, tlie %0a%3c more sensibly will they be felt when the wind blows from due %0a%3c north. In Asia, Greece, Spain, the coasts of Italy, Campania, %0a%3c and Apulia, the trees that support the vines, as well as the %0a%3c vines themselves, should have an aspect towards the north-east. %0a%3c If you wish to have male produce, let the flock feed in such %0a%3c a way, that this wdnd may have the opportunity of fecunda¬ %0a%3c ting the male, whose office it is to fecundate the females. Ihe %0a%3c w’ind Africus, known to the Greeks bj^ the name of Libs, blows %0a%3c from the south-w^est, the opposite point to Aquilo; when %0a%3c animals, after coupling, turn their heads towards this quarter,®* %0a%3c you may be sure that female produce has been conceived. %0a%3c %0a%3c The third ®* line from the north, which ive have drawn trans¬ %0a%3c versely through the shadow, and called by the name of “ de- %0a%3c cumanus,” will point due east, and from this quarter the wind %0a%3c Subsolanus blows, by the Greeks called Apeliotes. It is to %0a%3c this point that, in healthy localities, farm-houses and vineyards %0a%3c are made to look. This wind is accompanied with soft, gentle %0a%3c showers; Favonius, however, the wind that blows from due %0a%3c west, the opposite quarter to it, is of a drier nature ; by the %0a%3c Greeks it is known as Zephyrus. Cato has recommended that %0a%3c olive-yards should look due west. It is this wind that begins %0a%3c the spring, and opens the earth; it is moderately cool, but %0a%3c healthy. As soon as it begins to prevail, it indicates that the %0a%3c time has arrived for pruning the vine, weeding the corn, plant¬ %0a%3c ing trees, grafting fruit-trees, and trimming the olive; for its %0a%3c breezes are productive of the most nutritious effects. %0a%3c %0a%3c The fourth ®® line from the north, and the one that lies nearest %0a%3c the south on the eastern side, will indicate the point of the %0a%3c sun’s rising at the winter solstice, and the wind Volturnus, %0a%3c known by the name of Eurus to the Greeks. This wind is %0a%3c warm and diy, and beehives and vineyards, in the climates of %0a%3c Italy and the Gallic provinces, should face this quarter. %0a%3c Directly opposite to Volturnus, the wind Corns blows; it in¬ %0a%3c dicates the point of the sun’s setting at the summer solstice. %0a%3c %0a%3c Or the “ summer” wind. 8i Africus, or south-west. %0a%3c %0a%3c *2 Or, according to our mode of expression, the “second,” or “next %0a%3c but one.” %0a%3c %0a%3c ‘’3 Or, as we say, the “ third.’ %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 78.] PllOGNObXICS DEEIYED FKOM THE STTN. 117 %0a%3c %0a%3c and lies on the western side next to the north. By the Greeks %0a%3c it is called Argestes, and is one of the verj’^ coldest of the winds, %0a%3c which, in fact, is the case with all the winds that blow from the %0a%3c north; this wind, too, brings hailstorms with it, for which %0a%3c reason it is necessary to be on our guard against it no less than %0a%3c the north. If Volturnus begins to blow from a clear quarter %0a%3c of the heavens, it will not last till night; but if it is Subso- %0a%3c lanus, it will prevail for the greater part of the night. What¬ %0a%3c ever the Avind that may happen to be blowing, if it is accom¬ %0a%3c panied by heat, it will be sure to last for several daj's. The %0a%3c earth announces the approach of Aquilo, bj* drying on a sudden, %0a%3c while on the approach of Auster, the surface becomes moist %0a%3c Avithout any appai'ent cause. %0a%3c %0a%3c CUAP. 78. (35.) —PROGNOSTICS DERIVED FROM THE SUN. %0a%3c %0a%3c Having now explained the theory of the winds, it seems to %0a%3c me the best plan, in order to avoid any repetition, to pass on to %0a%3c the other signs and prognostics that are indicative of a change %0a%3c of Aveather. I find, too, that this is a kind of knowledge that %0a%3c greatly interested Virgil,®^ for he mentions the fact, that during %0a%3c the harvest even, he has often seen the Avinds engage in a %0a%3c combat that was absolutely ruinous to the improvident agri¬ %0a%3c culturist. There is a tradition, too, to the effect that Demo¬ %0a%3c critus, already mentioned, Avhen his brother Daraasus was get¬ %0a%3c ting in his harvest in extremely hot weather, entreated him to %0a%3c leave the rest of the crop, and house Avith all haste that which %0a%3c had been cut; and it was only within a very few hours that %0a%3c his prediction was verified by a most violent storm. On the %0a%3c other hand, it is particularly recommended never to plant reeds %0a%3c except when rain is impending, and only to sow corn just be¬ %0a%3c fore a shower ; we shall therefore briefly touch upon the prog¬ %0a%3c nostics of this description, making enquiry more particularly %0a%3c into those among them that have been found the most useful. %0a%3c %0a%3c In the first place, then, we Avill consider those prognostics %0a%3c of the weather Avhich are derived from the sun.®® If the sun is %0a%3c bright at its rising, and not burning hot, it is indicatrte of fine %0a%3c %0a%3c Georg, i. 313, et seq. %0a%3c %0a%3c “ ISiepe ego, quum flavis messorem induceret arvis %0a%3c Agricola, et fragili jam stringeret hordea culmo. %0a%3c %0a%3c Omnia ventorum concurrere proelia vidi.” %0a%3c %0a%3c ®® See the Treatise of Theophrastus on the Prognostics of the Weather. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c PLINr’s NAT U UAL UI STOUT. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XVIII. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 118 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c weather, but if pale, it announces wintry weather accompanied %0a%3c with hail. If the sun is bright and clear when it sets, and %0a%3c if it rises with a similar appearance, the more assured oi tine %0a%3c weather may we feel ourselves. It it is hidden in clouds at %0a%3c its rising, it is indicative of l ain, and of wind, when the clouds %0a%3c are of a reddish colour just before sunrise ; if black clouds aio %0a%3c intermingled with the red ones, they betoken rain as \\ell. %0a%3c When the sun’s rays at its rising or setting appear to unite, %0a%3c rainy weather may be looked for. When the clouds are red at %0a%3c sunset, they give promise ^ of a fine day on the morrow; but %0a%3c if, at the sun’s rising, the clouds are dispersed in various quar¬ %0a%3c ters, some to the south, and some to the north-east, even though %0a%3c the heavens in the vicinity of the sun may be bright, they are %0a%3c significant of rain and wind. If at the sun’s rising gr set¬ %0a%3c ting, its rays appear contracted, they announce the approach of %0a%3c a shower. If it rains at sunset, or if the sun’s rays attract the %0a%3c clouds towards them, it is portentous of stormy weather on the %0a%3c following day. WHien the sun, at its rising, does not emit %0a%3c vivid rays, although there are no clouds surrounding it, rain %0a%3c may be expected. If before sunrise the clouds collect into %0a%3c dense masses, they are portentous of a violent storm; but if %0a%3c they are repelled from the east and travel westward, they in¬ %0a%3c dicate fine weather. When clouds are seen surrounding the %0a%3c face of the sun, the less the light they leave, the more violent %0a%3c the tempest will be: but if they form a double circle round %0a%3c the sun, the storm will be a dreadful one. If this takes place %0a%3c at sunrise or sunset, and the clouds assume a red hue, the ap¬ %0a%3c proach of a most violent storm is announced : and if the clouds %0a%3c hang over the face of the sun without surrounding it, they %0a%3c presage wind from the quarter from which they are drifting, %0a%3c and rain as well, if they come from the south. %0a%3c %0a%3c If, at its rising, the sun is surrounded with a circle, wind %0a%3c may be looked for in the quarter in which the circle breaks ; %0a%3c but if it disappears equally throughout, it is indicative of fine %0a%3c weather. If the sun at its rising throws out its rays afar %0a%3c through the clouds, and the middle of its disk is clear, there %0a%3c will be rain; and if its rays are seen before it rises, both rain %0a%3c and wind as well. If a white circle is seen round the sun at %0a%3c its setting, there will be a slight storm in the night; but if there %0a%3c %0a%3c *® This, Fee observes, is confirmed by experience. Aratus, as translated %0a%3c by Avienus, states to a similar effect. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Cliap. 79.] PE0GN0STIC8 DEIUVED FBOM THE MOON. 119 %0a%3c %0a%3c is a mist around it, the storm will be more violent. If the sun %0a%3c is pale at sunset, there will be wind, and if there is a dark %0a%3c circle round it, high winds will arise in the quarter in which %0a%3c the circle breaks. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 79. —PEOGNOSTICS DERIVED FROM THE MOON. %0a%3c %0a%3c The prognostics derived from the moon, assert their right to %0a%3c occupy our notice in the second place. In Egypt, attention is %0a%3c paid, more particularly, to the fourth day of the moon. If, %0a%3c Avhen the moon rises, she shines with a pure bright light, it is %0a%3c generally supposed that we shall have fine weather; but if she %0a%3c is red, there will be wind, and if of a swarthy®’ hue, rain. If %0a%3c upon the fifth day of the moon her horns are obtuse, they are %0a%3c always indicative of rain, but if sharp and erect, of wind, and %0a%3c this on the fourth day of the moon more particularly. If her %0a%3c northern horn is pointed and erect, it portends ivind; and if it %0a%3c is the lower horn that presents this appearance, the wind will %0a%3c he from the south; if both of them are erect, there will be %0a%3c high winds in the night. If upon the fourth day of the moon %0a%3c she is surrounded by a red circle, it is portentous of wind and %0a%3c rain. %0a%3c %0a%3c In Varro we find it stated to the following effect:—“ If, at %0a%3c the fourth day of the moon, her horns are erect, there will be %0a%3c great storms at sea, unless, indeed, she has a circlet®® around her, %0a%3c and that circlet unblemished; for by that sign we are informed %0a%3c that there will be no stormy weather before full moon.

He is said to have witten a treatise on the winds, and %0a%3c Plutarch states tliat he demonstrated the figure of the moon. %0a%3c %0a%3c An astronomer of Cyzicus, and a friend of Aristotle, whom he assisted %0a%3c in completing the discoveries of Eudoxus. He invented the cycle of %0a%3c seventy-six years, called after him the Calippic. %0a%3c %0a%3c Of Colonus, a geometrician, to whom Archimedes dedicated his %0a%3c works on the spliere and cylinder, and on spirals. %0a%3c %0a%3c A grammarian, who is supposed to have written a commentary on %0a%3c Aratus. Varro, De Ling. Lat. x. 10, speaks of him as making the dis¬ %0a%3c tinctive characteristics of words to be eight in number. %0a%3c %0a%3c A famous astronomer of Athens, to whom the discovery of the cycle %0a%3c of nineteen years has been attributed. %0a%3c %0a%3c There were several learned men of this name, but it appears impos¬ %0a%3c sible to say which of them is the one here alluded to ; probably it is either %0a%3c the Pythagorean philosopher of HUgae, who wrote on Predestination, or %0a%3c else the historian, a native of Pieria in Macedonia. There was also an %0a%3c astronomer of this name, a native of Naxos, and a friend of Eudoxus of %0a%3c Cnidos. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 128 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c pliny’s natural history. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XVIIT. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Q^lnopides,®* Zenon,*^ Euctemon,®* Harpaliis,*® Hecataeus,’* %0a%3c Anaximander,®* Sosigenes,®* Hipparchus,* Aratus,* Zoroaster,® %0a%3c Archibius.* %0a%3c %0a%3c A famous astronomer, a native of Chios.

He flou¬ %0a%3c rished about B.c. 270. %0a%3c %0a%3c 3 Nothing can be said of him with any degree of historical certainty. %0a%3c By the Persians he was called Zerdusht, and was said to have been the %0a%3c founder of the Magian religion. There were several works in Greek %0a%3c hearing his name, but which, no doubt, were forgeries of a later age than %0a%3c that usually assigned to him. %0a%3c %0a%3c ■* He is mentioned in c. 70 of this Book, as writing a letter to Anlio- %0a%3c chus, king of Syria; but nothing further seems to be known of him. %0a---%0a> vol 4 [[https://archive.org/details/57011150RX4.nlm.nih.gov|#]]%0a> %0a> vol 5 [[https://archive.org/details/57011150RX5.nlm.nih.gov|#]]%0a> %0a> vol 6 [[https://archive.org/details/57011150RX6.nlm.nih.gov|#]]%0a\ No newline at end of file%0a
