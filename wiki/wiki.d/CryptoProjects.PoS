csum=The only coins without KYC are the ones initially created and distributed at the beginning or from peer to peer trading.  But the overwhelming amount will be bought from an exchange.  And coins generated from staking these are also known by the regulators.  Compare this to proof of work where every coin starts out with no kyc.
