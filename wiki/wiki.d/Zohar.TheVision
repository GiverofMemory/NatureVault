text=The Vision of Rabbi Chiya %0a%0a%0a%0a49. Rabbi Chiya prostrated himself on the ground and kissed it. He wept and %0asaid: "Dust, how hard and heartless you are, how many you have consumed, %0aall the pillars of Light and all the great souls were consumed by you. And %0athe greatest of all, Rabbi Shimon, the Light of the entire world, of all the %0aworlds, who illuminates and governs over the descending Light, upon which %0aour world exists, is also consumed by you, and yet you govern the world?" But %0athen he collected himself at once and said: "Do not be proud, dust, for the %0apillars of the world will not be betrayed to you, and Rabbi Shimon will not be %0aconsumed by you!" %0a%0aMalchut is the sole creation. And this sole creation is nothing but a desire %0ato receive pleasure. It was made this way, and its essence cannot be changed. %0aYet, what can be changed is the intention— for which or whose sake to receive %0athe pleasure. %0a%0aAs a result of Malchut's union with Bina with an altruistic will to bestow %0adelight, give pleasure, Malchut acquires Bina 's desire in addition to her own. That %0ais, an additional desire appears in Malchut— to bestow, opposite to her nature. %0a%0aOnly this desire of Bina in Malchut can result in a Zivug and reception of %0aLight. When Malchut receives all the desires that she possibly can from Bina, %0aand fills them with Light, only her own initial egoistic property will remain %0auncorrected, but even that will be corrected from Above by the Creator Himself. %0aThe order of correction and reception of Light in Bina s properties inside of %0aMalchut is referred to as the reception on the Zivug of Yesod, and it takes place %0asequentially along 6,000 degrees, called "6,000 years." %0a%0aMalchut de Malchut of the world of At^ilut cannot receive any Light during the %0a6,000 years until all of its parts are completely corrected. All the Zivugim (plural %0afor Zivug) throughout the 6,000 years are made not on Malchut herself, but on %0athe properties she received from Bina. The place of such a Zivug is called Yesod %0a%0a193 %0a%0a%0a%0a194 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0ade Malchut or Ateret Yesod. Whereas Malchut herself (egoistic desires) remains %0aclosed to the Light, and is therefore called the "closed gates." %0a%0aThe reception of Light during the 6,000 years, correction of the Partzufim, %0aand the gradual filling of Malchut with the Light, takes place with the help of %0aBina's desires in Malchut, which are called Miftacha (Yesod de Malchut), for the %0aimpure (egoistic) force has no power over this part of Malchut. %0a%0aYesod de Malchut means that Malchut only acts with the properties she received %0afrom a Higher Sefira— Yesod, which is free from the influence of the impure forces %0a(Klipot). All the properties, except for those of Malchut, are altruistic, since they %0aoriginate from Bina. However, since we wish to emphasize that a Zivug is made %0aon an altruistic desire, above the egoistic desire of Malchut, we usually say Yesod %0ainstead of Bina. And since Yesod is the Sefira immediately above Malchut, we say %0athat a Zivug is made not on the egoistic desires of Malchut, but on Yesod. And %0asince, upon acquiring the properties of Yesod, Malchut can receive the Light, %0asuch reception of Light on Yesod de Malchut is called "Miftacha" (from the word %0aMafte'ach, key)— the key that opens the way for the Upper Light. %0a%0aHowever, since Malchut herself, that is, Malchut de Malchut ("closed gates") %0aremains inaccessible to the Light for 6,000 years, Rabbi Chiya (a particular %0aspiritual degree) could not understand how Rabbi Shimon (the spiritual %0aPartzuf called Rabbi Shimon) could achieve such complete perfection. Indeed, %0aRabbi Shimon is a Partzuf of such spiritual height that it receives the Light of %0aYechida. And it is impossible to receive this Light without utilizing a Zivug on %0aMalchut de Malchut itself. %0a%0aAnd yet, this part of Malchut remains uncorrected until the completion of %0athe 6,000 years (the end of correction), and thus cannot be used. By defying %0athese desires, it is as though one has already partially corrected it. And all the %0aprohibitory commandments refer to Malchut de Malchut; hence, the ban imposed %0aon its use is called "a restriction." %0a%0aYet, if it is impossible to fill the "stony heart" (Lev HaEven), i.e., Malchut %0ade Malchut (the root of egoism, the basis of creation), with Light, how can %0aeven a single soul achieve complete correction? After all, complete correction %0aimplies the reception of Light in the entire Malchut. Each soul, each part of %0aMalchut that man is destined to correct contains a part of all the other parts of %0aMalchut, including a part of Malchut de Malchut, which he may not work with %0auntil the end of correction. %0a%0aOn the other hand, Rabbi Chiya sees Rabbi Shimon in a state of %0acomplete correction. So how could the latter have attained such state? This %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Vision of Rabbi Chiya %0a%0a%0a%0a195 %0a%0a%0a%0acontradiction roused Rabbi Chiya so greatly that he prostrated himself on the %0aground and cried out. %0a%0aIt is impossible to constantly "translate" the words of the Torah or The %0aZohar into a language we can understand, that "ground" signifies egoism and %0a"dust" refers to the impure forces, that "crying out" implies raising MAN, and so %0aforth. All the words and definitions in the text of The Zohar should be perceived %0a;nsuously rather than literally, as physical actions of our world. In other words, %0asver The Zohar speaks of is related only to inner, spiritual sensations anc %0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0aAll the worlds constitute the "environment," the spiritual sphere, within %0awhich the Creator made His only creation— man (Adam). Everything else was %0acreated only in order to help man to achieve his spiritual mission of becoming %0alike his Creator. %0a%0aJust as in our world, the world itself and all its inhabitants, except man, are %0aaerated by their animal nature, rather than creatures with free will, in %0alal worlds, all the spiritual beings, except for the soul, are operated by %0aleir spiritual nature. Upon being born in our world, man, too, is an animal %0awithout freedom to act against his egoistic desire to receive pleasure. He usually %0astays that way throughout his existence on earth, being not at all different from %0ale still, vegetative, and animate levels of nature, automatically following orders %0aler master, egoism. %0a%0awith the help of Kabbalah can one gradually receive Upper, spiritual %0astrength, and consequently acquire freedom of choice, that is, liberate himself from %0athe influence of the impure, egoistic forces, and become free in his desires, like the %0aCreator. However, such an opportunity is only given to one who can control his %0aautomatically-driven, egoistic nature: according to the strength of his screen, man %0aascends (moves inwardly, in his sensations) from this world to the spiritual. %0a%0aAfter creating the spiritual worlds as a home for his future creation, the %0aCreator created the creature (soul, Adam). The soul constitutes the desire to %0adelight in the sensation of the Creator, of His Light. The sensation of the %0aCreator is called "Light." There is nothing else in the entire universe besides %0athe Light and the soul! %0a%0aAlthough the soul itself is Malchut de Malchut (the only egoistic creation), %0athe Creator imparted onto it the property of altruism, having created it mixed %0awith the Kelim (desires) of Bina, thereby demonstrating how wonderful it would %0abe to be like Him. %0a%0aWhile performing altruistic actions, the soul (Adam) decided to use its %0anatural egoism, Malchut de Malchut itself, to receive the Creator's Light with %0a%0a%0a%0a196 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aaltruistic intentions. Yet, when it began to let the tremendous Light of Yechida %0ainto Malchut de Malchut, it could not resist and wished to enjoy it egoistically. %0aThis change in the soul's desires is referred to as its fall. %0a%0aAs a result of the fall, Adam's soul split into myriad parts (600,000), all of %0awhich fell into captivity of impure, egoistic forces (acquired egoistic desires). %0aAfter the fall, Adam corrected some of the souls (obtained an anti-egoistic %0ascreen), but only partially. And then, of the total number of souls, some were %0aselected for correction, lowered into this world, and clothed into bodies, %0ageneration after generation. %0a%0aThe descent (distancing from the Creator) into our world (egoistic %0asensations of only one's own desires) occurs as a result of attaching an additional %0a"makeweight" of egoism to the soul. In the spiritual world, movement (farther %0afrom the Creator or closer to Him) and distance (from Him) are determined by %0athe correlation of egoistic and altruistic desires within the soul. %0a%0aThe purpose behind the souls' descent to our world is to transform one's %0aegoistic desires with the help of Kabbalah, and to return to the Creator with %0aone's intentions, by performing altruistic actions. The souls' descent continues %0auntil each of them and all of them together achieve complete correction. %0a%0aAnd the most exalted souls that refer to the degrees of Yechida and GAR %0aof Haya depend on the correction of Malchut herself in Malchut of the world %0aof Atzilut ("closed gates"). These will only be corrected at the completion of %0athe 6,000 years, after the correction of all the rest. This is due to the inverse %0arelationship between the souls and the Light that fills them: the more egoistic %0athe soul is, and the lower it is located, the greater the Light that enters the %0ageneral Partzuf (the common soul) at the time of its correction. %0a%0a%0a%0aTHE LIGHT OF SOULS %0a%0a%0aYechida %0a%0a%0aHaya %0a%0a%0aNeshama %0a%0a%0aRuach %0a%0a%0aNefesh %0a%0a%0aMALCHUT (types of souls) %0a%0a%0aKeter %0a%0a%0aHochma %0a%0a%0aBina %0a%0a%0aZA %0a%0a%0aMalchut %0a%0a%0a%0aThis is why these exalted souls are consumed by dust (impure force), i.e., %0athe impure force rules over them with its enormous and insolent power, for it is %0acertain that no one and nothing can save these souls from captivity. %0a%0aThis is why Rabbi Chiya wept: "Dust, how cruel you are!" That the most %0aexalted souls are "consumed by you without any hope of escaping you!" In other %0awords, the actual root of creation, the primordial egoism cannot be corrected. %0a%0aIt turns out that as a result of the exalted souls' captivity by the rule of %0athe impure forces, all the righteous that bring Light to the entire world cannot %0aachieve perfection themselves. Since all the souls are interconnected, not a %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Vision of Rabbi Chiya %0a%0a%0a%0a197 %0a%0a%0a%0asingle individual soul can arrive at the end of correction until all the souls are %0acorrected. This is why they are susceptible to the ruthless rule of the dust. %0a%0aAt first, Rabbi Chiya wanted to say that Rabbi Shimon himself was also %0aconsumed by dust, i.e., did not achieve complete correction. He had heard that %0aRabbi Yosi also reasons that the closed gates are closed for all. Yet, after some %0acontemplation, he inquired: "If Rabbi Shimon revives all the worlds and governs %0athem, how can it possibly be that he has not reached perfection?" %0a%0aTherefore, he concludes that Rabbi Shimon was not consumed by the %0adust, that he did achieve complete correction and is probably in a state of %0aabsolute perfection. The thing that Rabbi Chiya could not understand, how- %0aever, is how any individual soul could achieve the end of correction prior to %0a(without) the complete correction of all the others. This, Rabbi Chiya could %0anot explain to himself. %0a%0a50. Rabbi Chiya stood up and started to walk and weep. Rabbi Yosi joined %0ahim. He fasted for forty days so that he might see Rabbi Shimon. He was %0atold he still was not worthy of seeing him. He wept and fasted for another %0aforty days. He was then shown a vision: Rabbi Shimon and his son Rabbi %0aElazar were discussing him, Rabbi Chiya, the words he said to Rabbi Yosi, and %0athousands are listening in on their discussion. %0a%0aAlthough the fasting that The Zohar speaks of is a spiritual act, in our world %0asuch a description is a good example of how strong a desire should be in order %0ato be answered from Above. Other spiritual actions include weeping, tears— %0athe small state (Katnut) of a spiritual Partzuf, in this case referred to as "Rabbi %0aChiya." Naturally, Rabbi Shimon and all the other characters of The Zohar are %0aspiritual Partzufim, rather than people of our world. %0a%0aTruth be told, the spiritual level of a person known by a certain name in %0aour world may coincide with his spiritual root described in the Torah. However, %0aelucidation of this matter exceeds the scope of this particular article. It is %0anonetheless essential to note that Pharaoh in the corporeal Egypt, naturally, %0awas not a spiritual Pharaoh, the way he is described in The Zohar (the Partzuf that %0aincludes all of Malchut), and Laban, portrayed in the Torah as a villain, is in fact %0athe Supernal Spiritual Light of Partzuf AB, the Supernal Light of Hochma. This %0awill be explained later on. %0a%0aThe strong desire to attain the degree of Rabbi Shimon allowed Rabbi Chiya %0ato see him, for he was certain that Rabbi Shimon had not been consumed by %0athe dust. He came to this conclusion precisely because of his conversation with %0aRabbi Yosi, and hence passionately desired to see Rabbi Shimon. %0a%0a%0a%0a198 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0a51. In that same vision, Rabbi Chiya saw several great celestial wings: how %0aRabbi Shimon and his son Rabbi Elazar mounted them and soared to the %0aAssembly of Heaven, while the wings waited for them. Afterwards, they both %0areturned to their place and shone brighter than ever before, brighter than the %0alight of the sun. %0a%0aThe Heavenly Assembly refers to the Assembly of the angel Matatron. %0aHowever, his full name is not pronounced, and the name Matat is used instead, %0afor pronouncing a name is equivalent to an action, which is not always desirable. %0aThe term Supernal Assembly refers to the Assembly of the Creator Himself, %0awhile the Heavenly Assembly refers to the Assembly of Matat. %0a%0aThe wings that were waiting for Rabbi Shimon and his son Elazar are angels %0a(spiritual forces, similar to robots or draft animals in our world), whose task is to %0ahelp the souls to ascend from one spiritual degree to another. And just as these %0awings must assist the souls in their ascent, they must assist them to descend to %0atheir places. Therefore, it is said that the wings were waiting for Rabbi Shimon %0aand his son Rabbi Elazar to bring them back down. %0a%0aAnd when Rabbi Chiya saw them returning from the Heavenly Assembly %0aback to their place (to Rabbi Shimon's Assembly), he noticed a new light on %0atheir faces, and radiance surrounded them that was brighter than the sun. %0a%0a52. Rabbi Shimon opened and said: "Let Rabbi Chiya enter and see how much %0athe Creator renews the faces of the righteous in the world to come. Happy is %0ahe who comes here without shame. Happy is he who stands in the other world %0aas a rigid pillar opposite all." And Rabbi Chiya saw himself entering, and %0aRabbi Elazar and all the other pillars of the world that were there stood up %0abefore Rabbi Chiya. And he, Rabbi Chiya, was ashamed; he entered, bending, %0aand sat at the feet of Rabbi Shimon. %0a%0aRabbi Shimon opened (opened the way for the Light) and said: "Happy is he %0awho enters without shame." And all that were present there felt no shame. Only %0aRabbi Chiya was ashamed. This is because they had the strength to withstand the %0apower of the dust, and Rabbi Chiya did not. They were all perfect, whereas Rabbi %0aChiya had a flaw— the desire to attain. And this is what he was ashamed of. %0a%0a53. A voice sounded: "Lower your eyes, do not raise your head, and do not %0alook." He lowered his eyes and saw Light that shone from afar. The voice %0areturned and said: "The Supernal Ones, concealed and enclosed, who have %0aeyes that watch over the entire world, look and see: the lower ones are sleeping, %0aand the Light of their eyes is concealed in their pupils. Wake them!" %0a%0aAfter he followed the instruction to lower his eyes and not raise his head (not %0ause his desire to receive Light, but only desires to bestow), he merited hearing %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Vision of Rabbi Chiya %0a%0a%0a%0a199 %0a%0a%0a%0a(Light of Hassadim) the appeal, with the help of which he attained everything %0ahe wished. The voice divides all souls into two groups: the first is a group of %0aSupernal Holy Ones that are concealed, who merited their eyes to be opened to %0abehold the entire world, and the second group of souls have the Light of their %0aeyes concealed in their eye-sockets, which is what blinded them. This is why the %0avoice called upon the souls of the first group to behold, i.e., to use the reception %0aof the Upper Light, to draw the Upper Light together with the second group. %0a%0a54. Who among you turns darkness into Light and savors bitter as sweet even %0abefore he came here, that is, while still living in the other world? Who among %0ayou hopes and waits each day for the Light that shines when the Lord distances, %0awhen His greatness grows and He is called the King of all kings of the world? %0aFor he who does not wait for this each day while living in this world, has no %0aplace in the other world either. %0a%0aThe Creator's goal is for man to fully attain Him while still living in this %0aworld, to feel Him as he did prior to descending into this world, prior to %0aincarnating in a physical body. From this the division of people of our world %0ainto two groups is clearly evident, and the voice appeals to them. %0a%0aThe voice emphasizes to each group their main advantage. To the souls %0aof the first group, it says that they turned darkness into Light. These are the %0asouls of the world of Atzilut, for the Creator created two opposite systems in the %0aworlds BYA: the system of darkness and bitterness opposite the system of Light %0aand sweetness. Therefore, in the Torah of the worlds BYA there is a division into %0asuitable and unsuitable, pure and impure, permitted and forbidden, holy and %0aunholy, whereas the Torah of the world of Atzilut, which consists wholly of the %0aCreator's names, contains nothing impure whatsoever. %0a%0aAnd the sinner Laban is regarded as a holy name in the world of Atzilut, %0aas well as the Pharaoh. And all the names that represent impure forces in the %0aworlds BYA become corrected in the world of Atzilut, exalted and pure spiritual %0aobjects and forces with corresponding holy names. Therefore, the souls that %0ahave attained the Light of the world of Atzilut transform all darkness into Light %0aand all bitterness into sweetness. In other words, the whole difference between %0athe holy, pure, and good, and their opposites lies in the correction of the desire %0aand in acquiring an anti-egoistic screen over the will to receive. %0a%0aAnd to the second group the voice said that they're waiting for the Creator's %0ahelp, and He will rise (Shechina, His manifestation to the lower ones) from the %0adust (in their sensations). But those who do not wait for Him, being preoccupied %0awith other aspirations, will not rise from the dust, and the sensation of the %0aCreator will remain concealed from them. %0a%0a%0a%0a200 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0a55. In his vision, Rabbi Chiya saw many of his friends gathering around the %0astanding pillars. And he saw them being elevated to the Heavenly Assembly, %0asome are elevated, while others are lowered. And above them all, he saw Matat, %0athe owner of wings, approaching. %0a%0aAs the voice was calling, Rabbi Chiya saw several souls of the righteous, %0abelonging to the two groups, standing around the two pillars that were already %0apresent in Rabbi Shimon's assembly, and whom he had already seen ascending %0ato the Heavenly Assembly. Some were ascending, and some were descending; %0amoreover, this motion ensued in mutually opposite directions. %0a%0aThis way the two groups help one another according to the calling voice, %0awhich instructs the first group to descend and the second to ascend. Rabbi Chiya %0asaw also that due to the excitement of all these souls over their aspirations, i.e., %0athe power of the two groups, Matat descended from the Heavenly Assembly to %0athe assembly of Rabbi Shimon and swore an oath. %0a%0a56. The angel Matat swore that he heard from behind the curtain how each %0aday the Creator remembers and grieves over Malchut, cast into the dust. And %0awhen He remembers her, He strikes 390 firmaments, and they all tremble %0awith terrible fear before Him. And the Creator sheds tears for the Shechina %0a(Divinity), Malchut that has fallen to the dust. And those tears simmer like %0afire, and fall into the Great Sea. And by the power of these tears, the Ruler of %0athe Sea, called Rachav, is revived, blesses the Creator's holy name, and vows to %0aswallow up everything, from the first days of creation, and to absorb all within %0ahimself, when all the nations gather against the holy nation, and the waters %0awill dry, and Israel will walk through dry land. %0a%0aThis vow signifies that the Creator never forgets, but remembers each day that %0athe Shechina lies in the dust. However, this does not refer to the entire Holy Shechina: %0athis, the Creator need not vow, for it is revealed and seen by all who dwell in the %0aUpper Worlds that everything He does is for the Shechina (Malchut) alone. %0a%0aBut this refers only to Malchut de Malchut. She is the one Rabbi Chiya thinks %0aabout being held captive by the impure forces, completely abandoned. Hence, %0ahe wept: "Oh dust that consumes all!" And here, the angel Matat, who has come %0ato the Assembly of Rabbi Shimon, revealed to Rabbi Chiya a great secret— that %0athe Creator's rule is absolute, and He remembers Malchut de Malchut each day. %0a%0aA Zivug (union of the Masach-screen and the Light-pleasure) is defined as %0aa stroke of Light onto the screen, a result of the desire to enter and cross the %0ascreen's barrier, while the screen restricts and repels it. This act of repelling is %0acalled the Returning (reversed) Light, as it rises from the screen from below %0aupwards and clothes the coming Light. %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Vision of Rabbi Chiya %0a%0a%0a%0a201 %0a%0a%0a%0aThis may be compared to the example of the host (Creator) offering delicious %0afood (Light) to his guest (Kli), who wishes to enjoy the delicacies. However, as %0aa result of the shame from being the receiver, the guest refuses to receive, and %0athe screen repels the food (Light). It is as though the guest (Kli) says to the host %0a(Creator) that he refuses to receive the pleasure (Light) for himself, for his own %0aenjoyment. This repelling of the food (Light) forms the Returning Light, for it %0astems not just from not wanting to feel shame, as it is in our world, but from the %0aspiritual Kli's desire to be like the Creator. %0a%0aThe Returning Light is that altruistic intention, desire. This is also the %0aspiritual Kli, and only within it can the Light be received; only in this intention %0acan one feel the Creator. %0a%0aAfter the Kli was able to repel all the pleasure coming to it, and demonstrated %0athat it could meet the condition of the first restriction (to refrain from egoistic %0areception), it began to calculate how much Light it could receive for the Creator's %0asake. The Kli receives only the amount of pleasure that it is certain it can receive %0afor the Creator's sake. %0a%0aThe delight that was received inside the Kli is referred to as the Inner Light. %0aThe amount of Light received inside the vessel determines the degree of similarity %0ato the Creator; the Kli acts like the Creator: just as He desires to bestow pleasure %0aupon the Kli, so the Kli wishes to bestow upon Him, to the extent of the Inner %0aLight received. Therefore, the size of the Kli, (from Peh to Tabur, where it receives %0athe Light) determines the degree of merging with the Creator. In this place, the %0aKli is merged with Him in properties and intentions. %0a%0aIf the Kli's powers of resistance are not sufficient to receive for the Creator's %0asake, and it can only refrain from reception, the Kli is considered to be in the %0a"small" state, Katnut. The Kli that was created by the Creator is the strongest. %0aHowever, afterwards, as it begins to descend, its screen gradually weakens until %0athe Kli can no longer receive for the Creator's sake. It is left with just enough %0astrength to not receive for itself. This is why from this state onward there is a ban %0aon reception of Light into the Kli's desires "to receive." The Kli may only use its %0aGE, but not its AHP. And the boundary beyond which the Light cannot spread %0ais called Parsa, the firmament. This barrier is built from Above; thus, even if the %0aKli suddenly wishes to receive the Light for itself, it will not be able to do so. %0a%0aThe screen divides the firmament and consists of four parts: Hochma, Bina, %0aTifferet, and Malchut (HBTM), the four letters of HaVaYaH. Because Malchut %0ajoined with Bina and thereby corrected her egoistic properties into altruistic %0aones, the screen is located not in Malchut, but in Bina. Bina is counted as %0ahundreds; therefore, the four parts HBTM equal 400. However, there is no Zivug %0a%0a%0a%0a202 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0a(reception of Light) on Malchut de Malchut itself (after all, it is called the "closed %0agates"). This means that Malchut contains ninety Sefirot, and not 100: 9 Sefirot, %0aeach consisting of ten. %0a%0aTherefore, the screen that is called "the firmament" and that makes a Zivug %0awith the Upper Light by reflecting it consists of 390 parts, for the part of Malchut de %0aMalchut is lacking. The firmament is therefore said to consist of 390 firmaments, %0aand on it a daily Zivug with the Shechina is made, whereas a Zivug on the dust, %0awhich signifies the ten parts of Malchut de Malchut, is forbidden. The impact %0abetween the screen and the incoming Light resembles shuddering from fear to %0areceive the Light inside of oneself, beyond the limits of one's restrictions. %0a%0aThere are five Sefirot in the Rosh (head) of a Partzuf: %0a%0a%0a%0aKeter %0a%0a%0a- Galgalta (or Metzach) %0a%0a%0a- forehead %0a%0a%0aHochma %0a%0a%0a- Eynaim %0a%0a%0a- eyes %0a%0a%0aBina %0a%0a%0a- Awznayim %0a%0a%0a- ears %0a%0a%0aZA %0a%0a%0a- Hotem %0a%0a%0a- nose %0a%0a%0aMalchut %0a%0a%0a- Peh %0a%0a%0a- mouth %0a%0a%0a%0aJust as the secretion from one's physiological eyes is called tears, the secretion %0aof the Light of Hochma from the part of the spiritual Kli called "eyes" is referred %0ato as "tears." Tears constitute the part of the Light that is rejected by the Partzuf %0adue to the absence of a screen on Malchut de Malchut. All the Light that comes to %0aa Partzuf wishes to enter and fill it with its pleasure, even the part of the Partzuf %0athat has no screen to receive with altruistic intentions. Therefore, the screen %0aimmediately repels this portion of the Light. %0a%0aBut between the strike of the Light from Above and the resistance of the %0ascreen from below, tiny drops of Light seep through the screen, which, due to its %0ahurry, is unable to repel them. These drops have nothing to do with the level of %0aHochma of the Partzuf, as they lack the clothing of the Returning Light. They exit %0athe Partzuf Hochma and receive the name "tears." But it is nonetheless Light! %0a%0aThis is similar to a state where we are filled with tears of compassion for %0aanother person. Indeed, all that exists in our world exists because it derives %0afrom its spiritual prototype, and all that transpires in this world, transpires only %0abecause it stems from its Upper, spiritual root. %0a%0aAfter all, the fact that the Upper Light strikes the screen, trying to break %0athrough its restriction, stems from its origin in the Highest Place, the Creator %0aHimself, and is unrelated to the creature's desire to receive this Light within %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Vision of Rabbi Chiya %0a%0a%0a%0a203 %0a%0a%0a%0athe bounds of its altruistic capabilities. The Light stems from the world of %0aInfinity, from the Creator Himself, long before the Kli appeared and wished %0ato restrict itself. %0a%0aThe Upper Light wishes to fill the desire to enjoy that it created, as it is said, %0a"the Creator wishes to dwell in His creatures below." The Light and the Creator %0aare one and the same; after all, man defines the sensation of the Creator as %0aspiritual Light. And this Upper Light strives to force its way through the screen %0aand enter man's desires, but the screen hurls it back. Thus, this repelled Upper %0aLight becomes Returning Light, which designates man's altruistic intentions to %0abestow delight upon the Creator. %0a%0aAs a result of the collision with the screen, portions of the Light fall %0aoutside, for these tears originate from the Creator's love and compassion for %0aHis creation. In our world, this spiritual action results in an emission of tears %0ain an individual overwhelmed with suffering and love. However, spiritual tears %0ado not disappear. %0a%0aThis is described in Song of Songs (8:6): "For love is as strong as death, %0ajealousy is as cruel as hell; the flashes thereof are flashes of fire, the very flame %0aof the Lord!" This is because these tears stem from the Upper One's love and %0acompassion for the lower one. And just as flaming tears shed by someone in our %0aworld burn, so do the boiling and burning Upper tears burn like fire, like the %0avery flame of the Lord! %0a%0aBeing related to the property of Hochma, Malchut is called "sea." It is %0atherefore said that the tears (Light of Hochma without first being clothed in %0aLight of Hassadim) fall into the sea, Malchut. And it is written that the many %0asea waters will not extinguish the Creator's love for His creatures, expressed %0ain these tears. %0a%0aIt was said during the creation of the world: "Let the waters be gathered %0atogether unto one place" (Beresheet, 1:9). But the angel that governed the sea did %0anot wish to swallow these waters, and was hence killed (was emptied of Light). %0aNow, as the tears fall, he is revived. %0a%0aThe reason for this is that during the creation of the world, Malchut de %0aMalchut itself had not undergone any kind of correction, as the Creator created %0athe worlds ABYA in a special correction, called MAN de Bina or Ateret Yesod, %0aand not MAN de Malchut or Malchut de Malchut. In other words, correction is %0apossible only if man corrects not Malchut de Malchut itself (his essence), but, %0awhile completely refraining from its use (use of egoism), he acquires higher, %0aaltruistic desires from Bina and receives the Creator's Light in them (in Sefirot %0aKHB-ZA de Malchut, in 390 Sefirot). %0a%0a%0a%0a204 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aThese higher, altruistic desires are referred to as desires of Bina or as MAN %0ade Bina, and the reception of Light in them (Zivug) is made not on egoism %0a(Malchut herself), but on the will to bestow, called Ateret Yesod. This Zivug is %0atherefore sufficient to fill only the first nine Sefirot in Malchut, but does not %0afill Malchut herself. %0a%0aProphet Yeshayahu (Isaiah) writes in this regard: "Who are you with, %0apartners? I started the worlds, and you are to complete them!" The correction of %0aMalchut de Malchut is incumbent solely upon the creatures. Hence, when the sea %0aruler was told: "Let the waters be gathered together unto one place," he objected %0aand did not wish to swallow up the created waters, for due to the uncorrected %0astate of Malchut de Malchut, the impure forces prevailed and ruled over him. %0aAnd that is why he was killed. %0a%0aHowever, these tears correct Malchut de Malchut, and thus revive the sea %0aruler so that he would rise from the dead, sanctify the name of the Lord, fulfill %0athe Creator's will, and swallow up the primeval waters. For then, all the impure %0aforces, all the evil in the world will disappear and all (desires) will gather in one %0aplace (property), whose name is Atzilut. This is because the world of Atxilut will %0aspread from the end of the world of AK down to our world, and there will come %0athe end of correction, for the worlds of BYA will return in their properties to %0athe world of Atzilut. %0a%0aIn the future, at the end of correction, after the correction of the first nine %0aSefirot of Malchut, when only Malchut de Malchut, the last, tenth Sefira, remains %0ato be corrected, when all the nations of the world (Malchut de Malchut) unite to %0adestroy Israel (the first nine Sefirot of Malchut, the desire to correct all the ten %0aSefirot of Malchut), the act of the sea ruler will be revealed in that he will swallow %0aup all the primeval, evil waters, and the waters (severe restrictions) will dry up, and %0athe sons of Israel (those who aspire for the Creator) will walk through dry land. %0a%0aThe prophet Micha (Micah) says of this: "As we fled the land of Egypt, we %0asaw wonders." However, this was only the beginning, for it was only in the End %0aSea (the Red Sea; the Hebrew name signifies the end of Malchut, or Malchut de %0aMalchut), and only for a limited time. But, at the end of correction, death will %0adisappear forever. %0a%0aThis is how Matat explained his oath: the Creator never forgets Malchut, %0awhich is cast in the dust. For even though a daily Zivug with the Shechina is made %0aon only 390 firmaments, on the nine Sefirot of Malchut and not on Malchut de %0aMalchut itself, which remains lying in the dust, and, as it seems to us, completely %0aforgotten by the Creator, nothing could be further from the truth. In truth, %0aHe corrects it with each Zivug, because with each Zivug, as a result of the 390 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Vision of Rabbi Chiya %0a%0a%0a%0a205 %0a%0a%0a%0afirmaments being struck, the tears fall outside. And these tears are not lost, but %0afall into the Great Sea (Malchut de Malchut), which receives from them slow, yet %0agradual corrections, even if it is the Light of Hochma without the clothing of %0athe Light of Hassadim. As it becomes more and more corrected, the sea ruler is %0arevived until the tears accumulate to the necessary amount for the correction of %0athe entire Malchut, so that all of her intentions would be for the Creator's sake. %0a%0aThis will occur when all the nations of the world unite to attack Israel. Then, %0athe sea ruler will rise back to life and swallow up all the primeval waters, for %0aMalchut de Malchut will receive the lacking correction, for each day the Creator %0acares for her until she, His only creation, reaches her final correction. %0a%0aAnd here Rabbi Chiya's delusion was revealed to him: he understood that %0anothing disappears in the dust, but, on the contrary, each day Malchut undergoes %0acorrections, just as Matat swore. %0a%0a57. Through all this, he heard a voice: "Clear this place, clear this place! The %0aMashiach (Messiah), the King-Redeemer is coming to the assembly of Rabbi %0aShimon," for all the righteous gathered there are the heads of groups and %0aassemblies, whereas all of the assembly members ascend from this assembly %0ato the Assembly of Heaven. And the Mashiach visits all these assemblies and %0aseals the Torah that stems from the mouths of the righteous. And at that %0amoment, the M.ashiach comes to the assembly of Rabbi Shimon, surrounded %0aby the heads of all the Supernal assemblies. %0a%0aAs a result of the great revelation— the end of correction— concealed in the %0aoath of Matat, all of the righteous present at Rabbi Shimon's Assembly were %0aelevated, especially the two groups of the righteous that caused Matat to appear %0aand take his oath. As a result, all of them attained Upper Degrees and reached %0athe levels of "heads of assemblies," for each assembly has members and a head, %0aand the difference between them is similar to the difference between VAK, GE %0aof the degree or Partzuf, from GAR, the complete Partzuf. %0a%0aHence, it is written that the place should be cleared for the Mashiach. After %0aall, when Matat revealed the secret of the end (of correction), and specifically %0ahow creation will be delivered from egoism, a voice appeared and commanded %0ato prepare a place for the Mashiach, the King-Redeemer, for the end of correction %0ais connected to the King-Mas hiach. %0a%0aHowever, only the righteous of Rabbi Shimon's assembly, who are above all %0athe heads of assemblies, merit his coming, for only those who are on the same %0aspiritual level as the King-Mashiach (all those who have already corrected all of %0atheir other properties— the first nine Sefirot in their part of desires-Malchut— all %0a%0a%0a%0a206 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aof the properties except for the original egoism, Malchut de Malchut) can merit %0athe revelation of his face. %0a%0aThe level of the Mashiach is the Light of Yechida. And if all the members had %0anot reached the level of the heads of the assemblies, the GAR of the degrees, %0ai.e., corrected all that they could, they would not have merited the revelation %0aof the Mashiach's face. But the heads of the Assemblies are not GAR of the low %0adegrees. Rather, they represent a level so high that all the members have merited %0areaching the Heavenly Assembly of Matat. %0a%0aAnd now all the members merited becoming the heads of the Assemblies, %0awherefrom they merited an ascent to the Heavenly Assembly. Moreover, %0athanks to their corrections, they merited the Mashiach himself coming to all %0athese assemblies to be adorned with their deeds in the Torah. And now all the %0amembers have merited reaching the level of the assemblies' heads. This is why %0athe Mashiach is adorned with the Torah of the assemblies' heads. Thus, thanks %0ato them, the Mashiach himself ascends to a Higher Degree. %0a%0a58. At that time, all the members stood up. Rabbi Shimon stood up, too, and %0ahis Light rose to the firmament. The Mashiach said unto him: "Happy are %0ayou, Rabbi, for your Torah has risen in 370 beams of Light, and each beam %0adivides into 613 beams (properties) that ascend and bathe in the rivers of %0athe holy Apharsemon (persimmon). And the Creator confirms and signs the %0aTorah of your assembly, of the assembly of Chizkiyah (Hezekiah), the King of %0aJudah, and the assembly of Achiyah ha Shiloni (Ahijah the Shilonite)." %0a%0aWhen the Mashiach revealed himself to them and came to Rabbi Shimon's %0aAssembly, all the members stood up (ascended from the level of VAK to GAR), %0aand Rabbi Shimon stood on the same degree as the Mashiach. And the Light rose %0ato the height of the firmament. This indicates that Rabbi Shimon has attained %0athe Light of the ten firmaments, the previously missing tenth firmament on %0aaccount of the closed gates of Malchut de Malchut, and has attained the Light of %0aYechida, which he now was able to receive, as he could make a Zivug on Malchut de %0aMalchut. And the Light of Yechida that shines from this Zivug is called Mashiach. %0aThe "sitting" level is 390, or VAK; the "standing" level is 400, or GAR. %0a%0aThe Mashiach said to Rabbi Shimon that his Torah gave rise to the Light of %0aYechida in Partzuf Atik, because: %0a%0aUnits (0 - 9) are in Malchut; %0aTens (10 - 90) are in ZA; %0aHundreds (100 - 900) are in Ima; %0aThousands (1,000 - 9,000) are in Aba; %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Vision of Rabbi Chiya %0a%0a%0a%0a207 %0a%0a%0a%0aTens of thousands (10,000 - 90,000) are in Arich Anpin; %0aAnd hundreds of thousands (100,000 - 900,000) are in Atik. %0a%0aSince each Sefira of Atik equals 100,000, the four Sefirot of HaVaYaH (HBTM %0aof Atik) total 400,000. %0a%0aHowever, in this case, he should have said that the Torah performed the %0adeed in 400,000; yet, he said that the Light emanated by Ima is not used on %0a400, but only on 370, for although the Torah had reached the zenith of the %0afirmament, it still could not reach GAR of the last, Supernal Hundred. Hence, %0athere are only 370, while the Upper Thirty are absent in Ima. %0a%0aThe same applies with regard to thousands— the Light of Aba does not use %0aGAR of each thousand, but only VAK, i.e., 600 instead of 1,000. Instead of the %0aGAR of each thousand, it uses thirteen (Hochma of the "thirty-two Netivot (paths %0aof) Hochma"). The number thirteen signifies Hochma of the "thirty-two Netivot %0aHochma," the weak Light of Hochma, called the holy Apharsemon. %0a%0aIt is therefore said that the Torah attained 370 Lights, and each of them divides %0ainto 613 beams; thus, in the 400 of Ima, thirty of the Upper Light of Hochma are %0aabsent, which leaves it with only 370. And each thousand lacks the Upper 400 %0a(GAR of Hochma). Instead of using the thirteen paths of the holy Apharsemon, each %0athousand contains no more than 613, for all the supernal secrets are concealed in %0aRabbi Shimon's assembly. And the Creator Himself sealed them, for He ascends %0aand becomes adorned with the achievements of all the righteous in the Torah. %0a%0aWe know from the Talmud (Sanhedrin, 99:1) that everything the prophets %0aever said refers only to the days of the Mashiach's coming, but in the future %0a(Yeshayahu, 64), everyone will behold the Creator themselves. For all the degrees %0aand levels that refer to the days of the Mashiach will then be corrected, and all %0athe secrets of the Torah will be revealed, everyone will attain complete revelation %0aof the Light, of the Creator, as it is said, everyone will see with their own eyes %0a(sight implies GAR de Hochma). %0a%0aFrom the aforesaid, it becomes clear that there exists an opportunity to %0acorrect one's individual Malchut de Malchut even before all the souls achieve it in %0athe future. In such a case, man reaches his individual level of attainment of 400, %0aalthough his general level cannot be higher than 370, as in the case of everybody %0aelse. This is the degree that Rabbi Shimon, Rabbi Chizkiyah, and Achiyah ha %0aShiloni had reached. %0a%0a59. The Mashiach said: "I have come here not to confirm the Torah of your %0aassembly, but only because the 'owner of wings' is on his way here. For I know %0athat he shall not enter any other assembly, but only yours." Meanwhile, Rabbi %0a%0a%0a%0a208 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aShimon told him of the oath taken by the "owner of wings." Right then %0athe Mashiach trembled in awe and raised his voice, and the Heavens shook, %0aand the Great Sea boiled, and the Leviathan stirred, and the entire world %0athreatened to overturn. %0a%0aAt that moment, he saw Rabbi Chiya in Rabbi Shimon's adornments. %0aHe asked, "Who gave man in this world the adornments, garment of %0athe other world?" (garment of the other world onto the body of this world). Rabbi %0aShimon answered, "This is Rabbi Chiya, the cresset of the Torah!" He said %0ato him, "Gather him and his sons (those who have left this world), and they %0ashall join your Assembly." Rabbi Shimon said, "Time was granted to him, %0ahe was granted time" (Rabbi Chiya' s time has not yet come). %0a%0aThe Mashiach said to Rabbi Shimon that he came not for the sake of the %0aTorah, but because the "owner of wings" has come to the assembly, wishing to %0aknow what Matat had said. For Matat had revealed that the end of correction %0awould be preceded by terrible suffering for Israel— the Heavens and the Great Sea %0awould tremble, and the world would be on the verge of collapse, as predicted in %0athe Talmud (Sanhedrin, 97): "All is broken." Hence, he raised his voice, wishing %0ato mitigate all this upheaval. %0a%0aThe Mashiach was surprised to see Rabbi Chiya's garment (that Rabbi Chiya %0aexists in a physical body of our world, in the property of this world), for if he %0ahad merited the appearance of Matat and his oath, he had attained the degree %0aof complete correction of all his evil. And since he merited seeing the Mashiach's %0aface, to receive the Light of Yechida, he had obviously completed his work in this %0aworld, and there is nothing left for him to do here. Hence, he should leave it %0aand enter Rabbi Shimon's assembly in the Garden of Eden. %0a%0aBut Rabbi Shimon persuaded Rabbi Chiya that he needs to continue %0aperforming new, additional corrections in this world. And both the Mashiach %0aand Rabbi Shimon explained to Rabbi Chiya what else specifically he still %0aneeded to do in this world. %0a%0a60. Rabbi Chiya trembled in awe when the Mashiach left, and his eyes fulfilled %0awith tears. For the Mashiach left Rabbi Shimon's Assembly weeping from the %0agreat desire for the final correction and redemption. And Rabbi Chiya was also %0aanguished from the fervent desire to reach the end of correction. Rabbi Chiya %0acried and said: "Happy is the lot of the righteous in the other world, and happy %0ais the lot of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai, who has merited all of this."

diff:1688307524:1688307524:=1,932d0%0a%3c The Vision of Rabbi Chiya %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 49. Rabbi Chiya prostrated himself on the ground and kissed it. He wept and %0a%3c said: "Dust, how hard and heartless you are, how many you have consumed, %0a%3c all the pillars of Light and all the great souls were consumed by you. And %0a%3c the greatest of all, Rabbi Shimon, the Light of the entire world, of all the %0a%3c worlds, who illuminates and governs over the descending Light, upon which %0a%3c our world exists, is also consumed by you, and yet you govern the world?" But %0a%3c then he collected himself at once and said: "Do not be proud, dust, for the %0a%3c pillars of the world will not be betrayed to you, and Rabbi Shimon will not be %0a%3c consumed by you!" %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut is the sole creation. And this sole creation is nothing but a desire %0a%3c to receive pleasure. It was made this way, and its essence cannot be changed. %0a%3c Yet, what can be changed is the intention— for which or whose sake to receive %0a%3c the pleasure. %0a%3c %0a%3c As a result of Malchut's union with Bina with an altruistic will to bestow %0a%3c delight, give pleasure, Malchut acquires Bina 's desire in addition to her own. That %0a%3c is, an additional desire appears in Malchut— to bestow, opposite to her nature. %0a%3c %0a%3c Only this desire of Bina in Malchut can result in a Zivug and reception of %0a%3c Light. When Malchut receives all the desires that she possibly can from Bina, %0a%3c and fills them with Light, only her own initial egoistic property will remain %0a%3c uncorrected, but even that will be corrected from Above by the Creator Himself. %0a%3c The order of correction and reception of Light in Bina s properties inside of %0a%3c Malchut is referred to as the reception on the Zivug of Yesod, and it takes place %0a%3c sequentially along 6,000 degrees, called "6,000 years." %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut de Malchut of the world of At^ilut cannot receive any Light during the %0a%3c 6,000 years until all of its parts are completely corrected. All the Zivugim (plural %0a%3c for Zivug) throughout the 6,000 years are made not on Malchut herself, but on %0a%3c the properties she received from Bina. The place of such a Zivug is called Yesod %0a%3c %0a%3c 193 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 194 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c de Malchut or Ateret Yesod. Whereas Malchut herself (egoistic desires) remains %0a%3c closed to the Light, and is therefore called the "closed gates." %0a%3c %0a%3c The reception of Light during the 6,000 years, correction of the Partzufim, %0a%3c and the gradual filling of Malchut with the Light, takes place with the help of %0a%3c Bina's desires in Malchut, which are called Miftacha (Yesod de Malchut), for the %0a%3c impure (egoistic) force has no power over this part of Malchut. %0a%3c %0a%3c Yesod de Malchut means that Malchut only acts with the properties she received %0a%3c from a Higher Sefira— Yesod, which is free from the influence of the impure forces %0a%3c (Klipot). All the properties, except for those of Malchut, are altruistic, since they %0a%3c originate from Bina. However, since we wish to emphasize that a Zivug is made %0a%3c on an altruistic desire, above the egoistic desire of Malchut, we usually say Yesod %0a%3c instead of Bina. And since Yesod is the Sefira immediately above Malchut, we say %0a%3c that a Zivug is made not on the egoistic desires of Malchut, but on Yesod. And %0a%3c since, upon acquiring the properties of Yesod, Malchut can receive the Light, %0a%3c such reception of Light on Yesod de Malchut is called "Miftacha" (from the word %0a%3c Mafte'ach, key)— the key that opens the way for the Upper Light. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, since Malchut herself, that is, Malchut de Malchut ("closed gates") %0a%3c remains inaccessible to the Light for 6,000 years, Rabbi Chiya (a particular %0a%3c spiritual degree) could not understand how Rabbi Shimon (the spiritual %0a%3c Partzuf called Rabbi Shimon) could achieve such complete perfection. Indeed, %0a%3c Rabbi Shimon is a Partzuf of such spiritual height that it receives the Light of %0a%3c Yechida. And it is impossible to receive this Light without utilizing a Zivug on %0a%3c Malchut de Malchut itself. %0a%3c %0a%3c And yet, this part of Malchut remains uncorrected until the completion of %0a%3c the 6,000 years (the end of correction), and thus cannot be used. By defying %0a%3c these desires, it is as though one has already partially corrected it. And all the %0a%3c prohibitory commandments refer to Malchut de Malchut; hence, the ban imposed %0a%3c on its use is called "a restriction." %0a%3c %0a%3c Yet, if it is impossible to fill the "stony heart" (Lev HaEven), i.e., Malchut %0a%3c de Malchut (the root of egoism, the basis of creation), with Light, how can %0a%3c even a single soul achieve complete correction? After all, complete correction %0a%3c implies the reception of Light in the entire Malchut. Each soul, each part of %0a%3c Malchut that man is destined to correct contains a part of all the other parts of %0a%3c Malchut, including a part of Malchut de Malchut, which he may not work with %0a%3c until the end of correction. %0a%3c %0a%3c On the other hand, Rabbi Chiya sees Rabbi Shimon in a state of %0a%3c complete correction. So how could the latter have attained such state? This %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Vision of Rabbi Chiya %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 195 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c contradiction roused Rabbi Chiya so greatly that he prostrated himself on the %0a%3c ground and cried out. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is impossible to constantly "translate" the words of the Torah or The %0a%3c Zohar into a language we can understand, that "ground" signifies egoism and %0a%3c "dust" refers to the impure forces, that "crying out" implies raising MAN, and so %0a%3c forth. All the words and definitions in the text of The Zohar should be perceived %0a%3c ;nsuously rather than literally, as physical actions of our world. In other words, %0a%3c sver The Zohar speaks of is related only to inner, spiritual sensations anc %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c All the worlds constitute the "environment," the spiritual sphere, within %0a%3c which the Creator made His only creation— man (Adam). Everything else was %0a%3c created only in order to help man to achieve his spiritual mission of becoming %0a%3c like his Creator. %0a%3c %0a%3c Just as in our world, the world itself and all its inhabitants, except man, are %0a%3c aerated by their animal nature, rather than creatures with free will, in %0a%3c lal worlds, all the spiritual beings, except for the soul, are operated by %0a%3c leir spiritual nature. Upon being born in our world, man, too, is an animal %0a%3c without freedom to act against his egoistic desire to receive pleasure. He usually %0a%3c stays that way throughout his existence on earth, being not at all different from %0a%3c le still, vegetative, and animate levels of nature, automatically following orders %0a%3c ler master, egoism. %0a%3c %0a%3c with the help of Kabbalah can one gradually receive Upper, spiritual %0a%3c strength, and consequently acquire freedom of choice, that is, liberate himself from %0a%3c the influence of the impure, egoistic forces, and become free in his desires, like the %0a%3c Creator. However, such an opportunity is only given to one who can control his %0a%3c automatically-driven, egoistic nature: according to the strength of his screen, man %0a%3c ascends (moves inwardly, in his sensations) from this world to the spiritual. %0a%3c %0a%3c After creating the spiritual worlds as a home for his future creation, the %0a%3c Creator created the creature (soul, Adam). The soul constitutes the desire to %0a%3c delight in the sensation of the Creator, of His Light. The sensation of the %0a%3c Creator is called "Light." There is nothing else in the entire universe besides %0a%3c the Light and the soul! %0a%3c %0a%3c Although the soul itself is Malchut de Malchut (the only egoistic creation), %0a%3c the Creator imparted onto it the property of altruism, having created it mixed %0a%3c with the Kelim (desires) of Bina, thereby demonstrating how wonderful it would %0a%3c be to be like Him. %0a%3c %0a%3c While performing altruistic actions, the soul (Adam) decided to use its %0a%3c natural egoism, Malchut de Malchut itself, to receive the Creator's Light with %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 196 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c altruistic intentions. Yet, when it began to let the tremendous Light of Yechida %0a%3c into Malchut de Malchut, it could not resist and wished to enjoy it egoistically. %0a%3c This change in the soul's desires is referred to as its fall. %0a%3c %0a%3c As a result of the fall, Adam's soul split into myriad parts (600,000), all of %0a%3c which fell into captivity of impure, egoistic forces (acquired egoistic desires). %0a%3c After the fall, Adam corrected some of the souls (obtained an anti-egoistic %0a%3c screen), but only partially. And then, of the total number of souls, some were %0a%3c selected for correction, lowered into this world, and clothed into bodies, %0a%3c generation after generation. %0a%3c %0a%3c The descent (distancing from the Creator) into our world (egoistic %0a%3c sensations of only one's own desires) occurs as a result of attaching an additional %0a%3c "makeweight" of egoism to the soul. In the spiritual world, movement (farther %0a%3c from the Creator or closer to Him) and distance (from Him) are determined by %0a%3c the correlation of egoistic and altruistic desires within the soul. %0a%3c %0a%3c The purpose behind the souls' descent to our world is to transform one's %0a%3c egoistic desires with the help of Kabbalah, and to return to the Creator with %0a%3c one's intentions, by performing altruistic actions. The souls' descent continues %0a%3c until each of them and all of them together achieve complete correction. %0a%3c %0a%3c And the most exalted souls that refer to the degrees of Yechida and GAR %0a%3c of Haya depend on the correction of Malchut herself in Malchut of the world %0a%3c of Atzilut ("closed gates"). These will only be corrected at the completion of %0a%3c the 6,000 years, after the correction of all the rest. This is due to the inverse %0a%3c relationship between the souls and the Light that fills them: the more egoistic %0a%3c the soul is, and the lower it is located, the greater the Light that enters the %0a%3c general Partzuf (the common soul) at the time of its correction. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c THE LIGHT OF SOULS %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Yechida %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Haya %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Neshama %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Ruach %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Nefesh %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c MALCHUT (types of souls) %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Keter %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Hochma %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Bina %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ZA %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c This is why these exalted souls are consumed by dust (impure force), i.e., %0a%3c the impure force rules over them with its enormous and insolent power, for it is %0a%3c certain that no one and nothing can save these souls from captivity. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is why Rabbi Chiya wept: "Dust, how cruel you are!" That the most %0a%3c exalted souls are "consumed by you without any hope of escaping you!" In other %0a%3c words, the actual root of creation, the primordial egoism cannot be corrected. %0a%3c %0a%3c It turns out that as a result of the exalted souls' captivity by the rule of %0a%3c the impure forces, all the righteous that bring Light to the entire world cannot %0a%3c achieve perfection themselves. Since all the souls are interconnected, not a %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Vision of Rabbi Chiya %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 197 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c single individual soul can arrive at the end of correction until all the souls are %0a%3c corrected. This is why they are susceptible to the ruthless rule of the dust. %0a%3c %0a%3c At first, Rabbi Chiya wanted to say that Rabbi Shimon himself was also %0a%3c consumed by dust, i.e., did not achieve complete correction. He had heard that %0a%3c Rabbi Yosi also reasons that the closed gates are closed for all. Yet, after some %0a%3c contemplation, he inquired: "If Rabbi Shimon revives all the worlds and governs %0a%3c them, how can it possibly be that he has not reached perfection?" %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, he concludes that Rabbi Shimon was not consumed by the %0a%3c dust, that he did achieve complete correction and is probably in a state of %0a%3c absolute perfection. The thing that Rabbi Chiya could not understand, how- %0a%3c ever, is how any individual soul could achieve the end of correction prior to %0a%3c (without) the complete correction of all the others. This, Rabbi Chiya could %0a%3c not explain to himself. %0a%3c %0a%3c 50. Rabbi Chiya stood up and started to walk and weep. Rabbi Yosi joined %0a%3c him. He fasted for forty days so that he might see Rabbi Shimon. He was %0a%3c told he still was not worthy of seeing him. He wept and fasted for another %0a%3c forty days. He was then shown a vision: Rabbi Shimon and his son Rabbi %0a%3c Elazar were discussing him, Rabbi Chiya, the words he said to Rabbi Yosi, and %0a%3c thousands are listening in on their discussion. %0a%3c %0a%3c Although the fasting that The Zohar speaks of is a spiritual act, in our world %0a%3c such a description is a good example of how strong a desire should be in order %0a%3c to be answered from Above. Other spiritual actions include weeping, tears— %0a%3c the small state (Katnut) of a spiritual Partzuf, in this case referred to as "Rabbi %0a%3c Chiya." Naturally, Rabbi Shimon and all the other characters of The Zohar are %0a%3c spiritual Partzufim, rather than people of our world. %0a%3c %0a%3c Truth be told, the spiritual level of a person known by a certain name in %0a%3c our world may coincide with his spiritual root described in the Torah. However, %0a%3c elucidation of this matter exceeds the scope of this particular article. It is %0a%3c nonetheless essential to note that Pharaoh in the corporeal Egypt, naturally, %0a%3c was not a spiritual Pharaoh, the way he is described in The Zohar (the Partzuf that %0a%3c includes all of Malchut), and Laban, portrayed in the Torah as a villain, is in fact %0a%3c the Supernal Spiritual Light of Partzuf AB, the Supernal Light of Hochma. This %0a%3c will be explained later on. %0a%3c %0a%3c The strong desire to attain the degree of Rabbi Shimon allowed Rabbi Chiya %0a%3c to see him, for he was certain that Rabbi Shimon had not been consumed by %0a%3c the dust. He came to this conclusion precisely because of his conversation with %0a%3c Rabbi Yosi, and hence passionately desired to see Rabbi Shimon. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 198 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 51. In that same vision, Rabbi Chiya saw several great celestial wings: how %0a%3c Rabbi Shimon and his son Rabbi Elazar mounted them and soared to the %0a%3c Assembly of Heaven, while the wings waited for them. Afterwards, they both %0a%3c returned to their place and shone brighter than ever before, brighter than the %0a%3c light of the sun. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Heavenly Assembly refers to the Assembly of the angel Matatron. %0a%3c However, his full name is not pronounced, and the name Matat is used instead, %0a%3c for pronouncing a name is equivalent to an action, which is not always desirable. %0a%3c The term Supernal Assembly refers to the Assembly of the Creator Himself, %0a%3c while the Heavenly Assembly refers to the Assembly of Matat. %0a%3c %0a%3c The wings that were waiting for Rabbi Shimon and his son Elazar are angels %0a%3c (spiritual forces, similar to robots or draft animals in our world), whose task is to %0a%3c help the souls to ascend from one spiritual degree to another. And just as these %0a%3c wings must assist the souls in their ascent, they must assist them to descend to %0a%3c their places. Therefore, it is said that the wings were waiting for Rabbi Shimon %0a%3c and his son Rabbi Elazar to bring them back down. %0a%3c %0a%3c And when Rabbi Chiya saw them returning from the Heavenly Assembly %0a%3c back to their place (to Rabbi Shimon's Assembly), he noticed a new light on %0a%3c their faces, and radiance surrounded them that was brighter than the sun. %0a%3c %0a%3c 52. Rabbi Shimon opened and said: "Let Rabbi Chiya enter and see how much %0a%3c the Creator renews the faces of the righteous in the world to come. Happy is %0a%3c he who comes here without shame. Happy is he who stands in the other world %0a%3c as a rigid pillar opposite all." And Rabbi Chiya saw himself entering, and %0a%3c Rabbi Elazar and all the other pillars of the world that were there stood up %0a%3c before Rabbi Chiya. And he, Rabbi Chiya, was ashamed; he entered, bending, %0a%3c and sat at the feet of Rabbi Shimon. %0a%3c %0a%3c Rabbi Shimon opened (opened the way for the Light) and said: "Happy is he %0a%3c who enters without shame." And all that were present there felt no shame. Only %0a%3c Rabbi Chiya was ashamed. This is because they had the strength to withstand the %0a%3c power of the dust, and Rabbi Chiya did not. They were all perfect, whereas Rabbi %0a%3c Chiya had a flaw— the desire to attain. And this is what he was ashamed of. %0a%3c %0a%3c 53. A voice sounded: "Lower your eyes, do not raise your head, and do not %0a%3c look." He lowered his eyes and saw Light that shone from afar. The voice %0a%3c returned and said: "The Supernal Ones, concealed and enclosed, who have %0a%3c eyes that watch over the entire world, look and see: the lower ones are sleeping, %0a%3c and the Light of their eyes is concealed in their pupils. Wake them!" %0a%3c %0a%3c After he followed the instruction to lower his eyes and not raise his head (not %0a%3c use his desire to receive Light, but only desires to bestow), he merited hearing %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Vision of Rabbi Chiya %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 199 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c (Light of Hassadim) the appeal, with the help of which he attained everything %0a%3c he wished. The voice divides all souls into two groups: the first is a group of %0a%3c Supernal Holy Ones that are concealed, who merited their eyes to be opened to %0a%3c behold the entire world, and the second group of souls have the Light of their %0a%3c eyes concealed in their eye-sockets, which is what blinded them. This is why the %0a%3c voice called upon the souls of the first group to behold, i.e., to use the reception %0a%3c of the Upper Light, to draw the Upper Light together with the second group. %0a%3c %0a%3c 54. Who among you turns darkness into Light and savors bitter as sweet even %0a%3c before he came here, that is, while still living in the other world? Who among %0a%3c you hopes and waits each day for the Light that shines when the Lord distances, %0a%3c when His greatness grows and He is called the King of all kings of the world? %0a%3c For he who does not wait for this each day while living in this world, has no %0a%3c place in the other world either. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Creator's goal is for man to fully attain Him while still living in this %0a%3c world, to feel Him as he did prior to descending into this world, prior to %0a%3c incarnating in a physical body. From this the division of people of our world %0a%3c into two groups is clearly evident, and the voice appeals to them. %0a%3c %0a%3c The voice emphasizes to each group their main advantage. To the souls %0a%3c of the first group, it says that they turned darkness into Light. These are the %0a%3c souls of the world of Atzilut, for the Creator created two opposite systems in the %0a%3c worlds BYA: the system of darkness and bitterness opposite the system of Light %0a%3c and sweetness. Therefore, in the Torah of the worlds BYA there is a division into %0a%3c suitable and unsuitable, pure and impure, permitted and forbidden, holy and %0a%3c unholy, whereas the Torah of the world of Atzilut, which consists wholly of the %0a%3c Creator's names, contains nothing impure whatsoever. %0a%3c %0a%3c And the sinner Laban is regarded as a holy name in the world of Atzilut, %0a%3c as well as the Pharaoh. And all the names that represent impure forces in the %0a%3c worlds BYA become corrected in the world of Atzilut, exalted and pure spiritual %0a%3c objects and forces with corresponding holy names. Therefore, the souls that %0a%3c have attained the Light of the world of Atzilut transform all darkness into Light %0a%3c and all bitterness into sweetness. In other words, the whole difference between %0a%3c the holy, pure, and good, and their opposites lies in the correction of the desire %0a%3c and in acquiring an anti-egoistic screen over the will to receive. %0a%3c %0a%3c And to the second group the voice said that they're waiting for the Creator's %0a%3c help, and He will rise (Shechina, His manifestation to the lower ones) from the %0a%3c dust (in their sensations). But those who do not wait for Him, being preoccupied %0a%3c with other aspirations, will not rise from the dust, and the sensation of the %0a%3c Creator will remain concealed from them. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 200 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 55. In his vision, Rabbi Chiya saw many of his friends gathering around the %0a%3c standing pillars. And he saw them being elevated to the Heavenly Assembly, %0a%3c some are elevated, while others are lowered. And above them all, he saw Matat, %0a%3c the owner of wings, approaching. %0a%3c %0a%3c As the voice was calling, Rabbi Chiya saw several souls of the righteous, %0a%3c belonging to the two groups, standing around the two pillars that were already %0a%3c present in Rabbi Shimon's assembly, and whom he had already seen ascending %0a%3c to the Heavenly Assembly. Some were ascending, and some were descending; %0a%3c moreover, this motion ensued in mutually opposite directions. %0a%3c %0a%3c This way the two groups help one another according to the calling voice, %0a%3c which instructs the first group to descend and the second to ascend. Rabbi Chiya %0a%3c saw also that due to the excitement of all these souls over their aspirations, i.e., %0a%3c the power of the two groups, Matat descended from the Heavenly Assembly to %0a%3c the assembly of Rabbi Shimon and swore an oath. %0a%3c %0a%3c 56. The angel Matat swore that he heard from behind the curtain how each %0a%3c day the Creator remembers and grieves over Malchut, cast into the dust. And %0a%3c when He remembers her, He strikes 390 firmaments, and they all tremble %0a%3c with terrible fear before Him. And the Creator sheds tears for the Shechina %0a%3c (Divinity), Malchut that has fallen to the dust. And those tears simmer like %0a%3c fire, and fall into the Great Sea. And by the power of these tears, the Ruler of %0a%3c the Sea, called Rachav, is revived, blesses the Creator's holy name, and vows to %0a%3c swallow up everything, from the first days of creation, and to absorb all within %0a%3c himself, when all the nations gather against the holy nation, and the waters %0a%3c will dry, and Israel will walk through dry land. %0a%3c %0a%3c This vow signifies that the Creator never forgets, but remembers each day that %0a%3c the Shechina lies in the dust. However, this does not refer to the entire Holy Shechina: %0a%3c this, the Creator need not vow, for it is revealed and seen by all who dwell in the %0a%3c Upper Worlds that everything He does is for the Shechina (Malchut) alone. %0a%3c %0a%3c But this refers only to Malchut de Malchut. She is the one Rabbi Chiya thinks %0a%3c about being held captive by the impure forces, completely abandoned. Hence, %0a%3c he wept: "Oh dust that consumes all!" And here, the angel Matat, who has come %0a%3c to the Assembly of Rabbi Shimon, revealed to Rabbi Chiya a great secret— that %0a%3c the Creator's rule is absolute, and He remembers Malchut de Malchut each day. %0a%3c %0a%3c A Zivug (union of the Masach-screen and the Light-pleasure) is defined as %0a%3c a stroke of Light onto the screen, a result of the desire to enter and cross the %0a%3c screen's barrier, while the screen restricts and repels it. This act of repelling is %0a%3c called the Returning (reversed) Light, as it rises from the screen from below %0a%3c upwards and clothes the coming Light. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Vision of Rabbi Chiya %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 201 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c This may be compared to the example of the host (Creator) offering delicious %0a%3c food (Light) to his guest (Kli), who wishes to enjoy the delicacies. However, as %0a%3c a result of the shame from being the receiver, the guest refuses to receive, and %0a%3c the screen repels the food (Light). It is as though the guest (Kli) says to the host %0a%3c (Creator) that he refuses to receive the pleasure (Light) for himself, for his own %0a%3c enjoyment. This repelling of the food (Light) forms the Returning Light, for it %0a%3c stems not just from not wanting to feel shame, as it is in our world, but from the %0a%3c spiritual Kli's desire to be like the Creator. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Returning Light is that altruistic intention, desire. This is also the %0a%3c spiritual Kli, and only within it can the Light be received; only in this intention %0a%3c can one feel the Creator. %0a%3c %0a%3c After the Kli was able to repel all the pleasure coming to it, and demonstrated %0a%3c that it could meet the condition of the first restriction (to refrain from egoistic %0a%3c reception), it began to calculate how much Light it could receive for the Creator's %0a%3c sake. The Kli receives only the amount of pleasure that it is certain it can receive %0a%3c for the Creator's sake. %0a%3c %0a%3c The delight that was received inside the Kli is referred to as the Inner Light. %0a%3c The amount of Light received inside the vessel determines the degree of similarity %0a%3c to the Creator; the Kli acts like the Creator: just as He desires to bestow pleasure %0a%3c upon the Kli, so the Kli wishes to bestow upon Him, to the extent of the Inner %0a%3c Light received. Therefore, the size of the Kli, (from Peh to Tabur, where it receives %0a%3c the Light) determines the degree of merging with the Creator. In this place, the %0a%3c Kli is merged with Him in properties and intentions. %0a%3c %0a%3c If the Kli's powers of resistance are not sufficient to receive for the Creator's %0a%3c sake, and it can only refrain from reception, the Kli is considered to be in the %0a%3c "small" state, Katnut. The Kli that was created by the Creator is the strongest. %0a%3c However, afterwards, as it begins to descend, its screen gradually weakens until %0a%3c the Kli can no longer receive for the Creator's sake. It is left with just enough %0a%3c strength to not receive for itself. This is why from this state onward there is a ban %0a%3c on reception of Light into the Kli's desires "to receive." The Kli may only use its %0a%3c GE, but not its AHP. And the boundary beyond which the Light cannot spread %0a%3c is called Parsa, the firmament. This barrier is built from Above; thus, even if the %0a%3c Kli suddenly wishes to receive the Light for itself, it will not be able to do so. %0a%3c %0a%3c The screen divides the firmament and consists of four parts: Hochma, Bina, %0a%3c Tifferet, and Malchut (HBTM), the four letters of HaVaYaH. Because Malchut %0a%3c joined with Bina and thereby corrected her egoistic properties into altruistic %0a%3c ones, the screen is located not in Malchut, but in Bina. Bina is counted as %0a%3c hundreds; therefore, the four parts HBTM equal 400. However, there is no Zivug %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 202 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c (reception of Light) on Malchut de Malchut itself (after all, it is called the "closed %0a%3c gates"). This means that Malchut contains ninety Sefirot, and not 100: 9 Sefirot, %0a%3c each consisting of ten. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, the screen that is called "the firmament" and that makes a Zivug %0a%3c with the Upper Light by reflecting it consists of 390 parts, for the part of Malchut de %0a%3c Malchut is lacking. The firmament is therefore said to consist of 390 firmaments, %0a%3c and on it a daily Zivug with the Shechina is made, whereas a Zivug on the dust, %0a%3c which signifies the ten parts of Malchut de Malchut, is forbidden. The impact %0a%3c between the screen and the incoming Light resembles shuddering from fear to %0a%3c receive the Light inside of oneself, beyond the limits of one's restrictions. %0a%3c %0a%3c There are five Sefirot in the Rosh (head) of a Partzuf: %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Keter %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c - Galgalta (or Metzach) %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c - forehead %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Hochma %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c - Eynaim %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c - eyes %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Bina %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c - Awznayim %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c - ears %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ZA %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c - Hotem %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c - nose %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c - Peh %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c - mouth %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Just as the secretion from one's physiological eyes is called tears, the secretion %0a%3c of the Light of Hochma from the part of the spiritual Kli called "eyes" is referred %0a%3c to as "tears." Tears constitute the part of the Light that is rejected by the Partzuf %0a%3c due to the absence of a screen on Malchut de Malchut. All the Light that comes to %0a%3c a Partzuf wishes to enter and fill it with its pleasure, even the part of the Partzuf %0a%3c that has no screen to receive with altruistic intentions. Therefore, the screen %0a%3c immediately repels this portion of the Light. %0a%3c %0a%3c But between the strike of the Light from Above and the resistance of the %0a%3c screen from below, tiny drops of Light seep through the screen, which, due to its %0a%3c hurry, is unable to repel them. These drops have nothing to do with the level of %0a%3c Hochma of the Partzuf, as they lack the clothing of the Returning Light. They exit %0a%3c the Partzuf Hochma and receive the name "tears." But it is nonetheless Light! %0a%3c %0a%3c This is similar to a state where we are filled with tears of compassion for %0a%3c another person. Indeed, all that exists in our world exists because it derives %0a%3c from its spiritual prototype, and all that transpires in this world, transpires only %0a%3c because it stems from its Upper, spiritual root. %0a%3c %0a%3c After all, the fact that the Upper Light strikes the screen, trying to break %0a%3c through its restriction, stems from its origin in the Highest Place, the Creator %0a%3c Himself, and is unrelated to the creature's desire to receive this Light within %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Vision of Rabbi Chiya %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 203 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c the bounds of its altruistic capabilities. The Light stems from the world of %0a%3c Infinity, from the Creator Himself, long before the Kli appeared and wished %0a%3c to restrict itself. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Upper Light wishes to fill the desire to enjoy that it created, as it is said, %0a%3c "the Creator wishes to dwell in His creatures below." The Light and the Creator %0a%3c are one and the same; after all, man defines the sensation of the Creator as %0a%3c spiritual Light. And this Upper Light strives to force its way through the screen %0a%3c and enter man's desires, but the screen hurls it back. Thus, this repelled Upper %0a%3c Light becomes Returning Light, which designates man's altruistic intentions to %0a%3c bestow delight upon the Creator. %0a%3c %0a%3c As a result of the collision with the screen, portions of the Light fall %0a%3c outside, for these tears originate from the Creator's love and compassion for %0a%3c His creation. In our world, this spiritual action results in an emission of tears %0a%3c in an individual overwhelmed with suffering and love. However, spiritual tears %0a%3c do not disappear. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is described in Song of Songs (8:6): "For love is as strong as death, %0a%3c jealousy is as cruel as hell; the flashes thereof are flashes of fire, the very flame %0a%3c of the Lord!" This is because these tears stem from the Upper One's love and %0a%3c compassion for the lower one. And just as flaming tears shed by someone in our %0a%3c world burn, so do the boiling and burning Upper tears burn like fire, like the %0a%3c very flame of the Lord! %0a%3c %0a%3c Being related to the property of Hochma, Malchut is called "sea." It is %0a%3c therefore said that the tears (Light of Hochma without first being clothed in %0a%3c Light of Hassadim) fall into the sea, Malchut. And it is written that the many %0a%3c sea waters will not extinguish the Creator's love for His creatures, expressed %0a%3c in these tears. %0a%3c %0a%3c It was said during the creation of the world: "Let the waters be gathered %0a%3c together unto one place" (Beresheet, 1:9). But the angel that governed the sea did %0a%3c not wish to swallow these waters, and was hence killed (was emptied of Light). %0a%3c Now, as the tears fall, he is revived. %0a%3c %0a%3c The reason for this is that during the creation of the world, Malchut de %0a%3c Malchut itself had not undergone any kind of correction, as the Creator created %0a%3c the worlds ABYA in a special correction, called MAN de Bina or Ateret Yesod, %0a%3c and not MAN de Malchut or Malchut de Malchut. In other words, correction is %0a%3c possible only if man corrects not Malchut de Malchut itself (his essence), but, %0a%3c while completely refraining from its use (use of egoism), he acquires higher, %0a%3c altruistic desires from Bina and receives the Creator's Light in them (in Sefirot %0a%3c KHB-ZA de Malchut, in 390 Sefirot). %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 204 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c These higher, altruistic desires are referred to as desires of Bina or as MAN %0a%3c de Bina, and the reception of Light in them (Zivug) is made not on egoism %0a%3c (Malchut herself), but on the will to bestow, called Ateret Yesod. This Zivug is %0a%3c therefore sufficient to fill only the first nine Sefirot in Malchut, but does not %0a%3c fill Malchut herself. %0a%3c %0a%3c Prophet Yeshayahu (Isaiah) writes in this regard: "Who are you with, %0a%3c partners? I started the worlds, and you are to complete them!" The correction of %0a%3c Malchut de Malchut is incumbent solely upon the creatures. Hence, when the sea %0a%3c ruler was told: "Let the waters be gathered together unto one place," he objected %0a%3c and did not wish to swallow up the created waters, for due to the uncorrected %0a%3c state of Malchut de Malchut, the impure forces prevailed and ruled over him. %0a%3c And that is why he was killed. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, these tears correct Malchut de Malchut, and thus revive the sea %0a%3c ruler so that he would rise from the dead, sanctify the name of the Lord, fulfill %0a%3c the Creator's will, and swallow up the primeval waters. For then, all the impure %0a%3c forces, all the evil in the world will disappear and all (desires) will gather in one %0a%3c place (property), whose name is Atzilut. This is because the world of Atxilut will %0a%3c spread from the end of the world of AK down to our world, and there will come %0a%3c the end of correction, for the worlds of BYA will return in their properties to %0a%3c the world of Atzilut. %0a%3c %0a%3c In the future, at the end of correction, after the correction of the first nine %0a%3c Sefirot of Malchut, when only Malchut de Malchut, the last, tenth Sefira, remains %0a%3c to be corrected, when all the nations of the world (Malchut de Malchut) unite to %0a%3c destroy Israel (the first nine Sefirot of Malchut, the desire to correct all the ten %0a%3c Sefirot of Malchut), the act of the sea ruler will be revealed in that he will swallow %0a%3c up all the primeval, evil waters, and the waters (severe restrictions) will dry up, and %0a%3c the sons of Israel (those who aspire for the Creator) will walk through dry land. %0a%3c %0a%3c The prophet Micha (Micah) says of this: "As we fled the land of Egypt, we %0a%3c saw wonders." However, this was only the beginning, for it was only in the End %0a%3c Sea (the Red Sea; the Hebrew name signifies the end of Malchut, or Malchut de %0a%3c Malchut), and only for a limited time. But, at the end of correction, death will %0a%3c disappear forever. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is how Matat explained his oath: the Creator never forgets Malchut, %0a%3c which is cast in the dust. For even though a daily Zivug with the Shechina is made %0a%3c on only 390 firmaments, on the nine Sefirot of Malchut and not on Malchut de %0a%3c Malchut itself, which remains lying in the dust, and, as it seems to us, completely %0a%3c forgotten by the Creator, nothing could be further from the truth. In truth, %0a%3c He corrects it with each Zivug, because with each Zivug, as a result of the 390 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Vision of Rabbi Chiya %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 205 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c firmaments being struck, the tears fall outside. And these tears are not lost, but %0a%3c fall into the Great Sea (Malchut de Malchut), which receives from them slow, yet %0a%3c gradual corrections, even if it is the Light of Hochma without the clothing of %0a%3c the Light of Hassadim. As it becomes more and more corrected, the sea ruler is %0a%3c revived until the tears accumulate to the necessary amount for the correction of %0a%3c the entire Malchut, so that all of her intentions would be for the Creator's sake. %0a%3c %0a%3c This will occur when all the nations of the world unite to attack Israel. Then, %0a%3c the sea ruler will rise back to life and swallow up all the primeval waters, for %0a%3c Malchut de Malchut will receive the lacking correction, for each day the Creator %0a%3c cares for her until she, His only creation, reaches her final correction. %0a%3c %0a%3c And here Rabbi Chiya's delusion was revealed to him: he understood that %0a%3c nothing disappears in the dust, but, on the contrary, each day Malchut undergoes %0a%3c corrections, just as Matat swore. %0a%3c %0a%3c 57. Through all this, he heard a voice: "Clear this place, clear this place! The %0a%3c Mashiach (Messiah), the King-Redeemer is coming to the assembly of Rabbi %0a%3c Shimon," for all the righteous gathered there are the heads of groups and %0a%3c assemblies, whereas all of the assembly members ascend from this assembly %0a%3c to the Assembly of Heaven. And the Mashiach visits all these assemblies and %0a%3c seals the Torah that stems from the mouths of the righteous. And at that %0a%3c moment, the M.ashiach comes to the assembly of Rabbi Shimon, surrounded %0a%3c by the heads of all the Supernal assemblies. %0a%3c %0a%3c As a result of the great revelation— the end of correction— concealed in the %0a%3c oath of Matat, all of the righteous present at Rabbi Shimon's Assembly were %0a%3c elevated, especially the two groups of the righteous that caused Matat to appear %0a%3c and take his oath. As a result, all of them attained Upper Degrees and reached %0a%3c the levels of "heads of assemblies," for each assembly has members and a head, %0a%3c and the difference between them is similar to the difference between VAK, GE %0a%3c of the degree or Partzuf, from GAR, the complete Partzuf. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, it is written that the place should be cleared for the Mashiach. After %0a%3c all, when Matat revealed the secret of the end (of correction), and specifically %0a%3c how creation will be delivered from egoism, a voice appeared and commanded %0a%3c to prepare a place for the Mashiach, the King-Redeemer, for the end of correction %0a%3c is connected to the King-Mas hiach. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, only the righteous of Rabbi Shimon's assembly, who are above all %0a%3c the heads of assemblies, merit his coming, for only those who are on the same %0a%3c spiritual level as the King-Mashiach (all those who have already corrected all of %0a%3c their other properties— the first nine Sefirot in their part of desires-Malchut— all %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 206 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c of the properties except for the original egoism, Malchut de Malchut) can merit %0a%3c the revelation of his face. %0a%3c %0a%3c The level of the Mashiach is the Light of Yechida. And if all the members had %0a%3c not reached the level of the heads of the assemblies, the GAR of the degrees, %0a%3c i.e., corrected all that they could, they would not have merited the revelation %0a%3c of the Mashiach's face. But the heads of the Assemblies are not GAR of the low %0a%3c degrees. Rather, they represent a level so high that all the members have merited %0a%3c reaching the Heavenly Assembly of Matat. %0a%3c %0a%3c And now all the members merited becoming the heads of the Assemblies, %0a%3c wherefrom they merited an ascent to the Heavenly Assembly. Moreover, %0a%3c thanks to their corrections, they merited the Mashiach himself coming to all %0a%3c these assemblies to be adorned with their deeds in the Torah. And now all the %0a%3c members have merited reaching the level of the assemblies' heads. This is why %0a%3c the Mashiach is adorned with the Torah of the assemblies' heads. Thus, thanks %0a%3c to them, the Mashiach himself ascends to a Higher Degree. %0a%3c %0a%3c 58. At that time, all the members stood up. Rabbi Shimon stood up, too, and %0a%3c his Light rose to the firmament. The Mashiach said unto him: "Happy are %0a%3c you, Rabbi, for your Torah has risen in 370 beams of Light, and each beam %0a%3c divides into 613 beams (properties) that ascend and bathe in the rivers of %0a%3c the holy Apharsemon (persimmon). And the Creator confirms and signs the %0a%3c Torah of your assembly, of the assembly of Chizkiyah (Hezekiah), the King of %0a%3c Judah, and the assembly of Achiyah ha Shiloni (Ahijah the Shilonite)." %0a%3c %0a%3c When the Mashiach revealed himself to them and came to Rabbi Shimon's %0a%3c Assembly, all the members stood up (ascended from the level of VAK to GAR), %0a%3c and Rabbi Shimon stood on the same degree as the Mashiach. And the Light rose %0a%3c to the height of the firmament. This indicates that Rabbi Shimon has attained %0a%3c the Light of the ten firmaments, the previously missing tenth firmament on %0a%3c account of the closed gates of Malchut de Malchut, and has attained the Light of %0a%3c Yechida, which he now was able to receive, as he could make a Zivug on Malchut de %0a%3c Malchut. And the Light of Yechida that shines from this Zivug is called Mashiach. %0a%3c The "sitting" level is 390, or VAK; the "standing" level is 400, or GAR. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Mashiach said to Rabbi Shimon that his Torah gave rise to the Light of %0a%3c Yechida in Partzuf Atik, because: %0a%3c %0a%3c Units (0 - 9) are in Malchut; %0a%3c Tens (10 - 90) are in ZA; %0a%3c Hundreds (100 - 900) are in Ima; %0a%3c Thousands (1,000 - 9,000) are in Aba; %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Vision of Rabbi Chiya %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 207 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Tens of thousands (10,000 - 90,000) are in Arich Anpin; %0a%3c And hundreds of thousands (100,000 - 900,000) are in Atik. %0a%3c %0a%3c Since each Sefira of Atik equals 100,000, the four Sefirot of HaVaYaH (HBTM %0a%3c of Atik) total 400,000. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, in this case, he should have said that the Torah performed the %0a%3c deed in 400,000; yet, he said that the Light emanated by Ima is not used on %0a%3c 400, but only on 370, for although the Torah had reached the zenith of the %0a%3c firmament, it still could not reach GAR of the last, Supernal Hundred. Hence, %0a%3c there are only 370, while the Upper Thirty are absent in Ima. %0a%3c %0a%3c The same applies with regard to thousands— the Light of Aba does not use %0a%3c GAR of each thousand, but only VAK, i.e., 600 instead of 1,000. Instead of the %0a%3c GAR of each thousand, it uses thirteen (Hochma of the "thirty-two Netivot (paths %0a%3c of) Hochma"). The number thirteen signifies Hochma of the "thirty-two Netivot %0a%3c Hochma," the weak Light of Hochma, called the holy Apharsemon. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is therefore said that the Torah attained 370 Lights, and each of them divides %0a%3c into 613 beams; thus, in the 400 of Ima, thirty of the Upper Light of Hochma are %0a%3c absent, which leaves it with only 370. And each thousand lacks the Upper 400 %0a%3c (GAR of Hochma). Instead of using the thirteen paths of the holy Apharsemon, each %0a%3c thousand contains no more than 613, for all the supernal secrets are concealed in %0a%3c Rabbi Shimon's assembly. And the Creator Himself sealed them, for He ascends %0a%3c and becomes adorned with the achievements of all the righteous in the Torah. %0a%3c %0a%3c We know from the Talmud (Sanhedrin, 99:1) that everything the prophets %0a%3c ever said refers only to the days of the Mashiach's coming, but in the future %0a%3c (Yeshayahu, 64), everyone will behold the Creator themselves. For all the degrees %0a%3c and levels that refer to the days of the Mashiach will then be corrected, and all %0a%3c the secrets of the Torah will be revealed, everyone will attain complete revelation %0a%3c of the Light, of the Creator, as it is said, everyone will see with their own eyes %0a%3c (sight implies GAR de Hochma). %0a%3c %0a%3c From the aforesaid, it becomes clear that there exists an opportunity to %0a%3c correct one's individual Malchut de Malchut even before all the souls achieve it in %0a%3c the future. In such a case, man reaches his individual level of attainment of 400, %0a%3c although his general level cannot be higher than 370, as in the case of everybody %0a%3c else. This is the degree that Rabbi Shimon, Rabbi Chizkiyah, and Achiyah ha %0a%3c Shiloni had reached. %0a%3c %0a%3c 59. The Mashiach said: "I have come here not to confirm the Torah of your %0a%3c assembly, but only because the 'owner of wings' is on his way here. For I know %0a%3c that he shall not enter any other assembly, but only yours." Meanwhile, Rabbi %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 208 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Shimon told him of the oath taken by the "owner of wings." Right then %0a%3c the Mashiach trembled in awe and raised his voice, and the Heavens shook, %0a%3c and the Great Sea boiled, and the Leviathan stirred, and the entire world %0a%3c threatened to overturn. %0a%3c %0a%3c At that moment, he saw Rabbi Chiya in Rabbi Shimon's adornments. %0a%3c He asked, "Who gave man in this world the adornments, garment of %0a%3c the other world?" (garment of the other world onto the body of this world). Rabbi %0a%3c Shimon answered, "This is Rabbi Chiya, the cresset of the Torah!" He said %0a%3c to him, "Gather him and his sons (those who have left this world), and they %0a%3c shall join your Assembly." Rabbi Shimon said, "Time was granted to him, %0a%3c he was granted time" (Rabbi Chiya' s time has not yet come). %0a%3c %0a%3c The Mashiach said to Rabbi Shimon that he came not for the sake of the %0a%3c Torah, but because the "owner of wings" has come to the assembly, wishing to %0a%3c know what Matat had said. For Matat had revealed that the end of correction %0a%3c would be preceded by terrible suffering for Israel— the Heavens and the Great Sea %0a%3c would tremble, and the world would be on the verge of collapse, as predicted in %0a%3c the Talmud (Sanhedrin, 97): "All is broken." Hence, he raised his voice, wishing %0a%3c to mitigate all this upheaval. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Mashiach was surprised to see Rabbi Chiya's garment (that Rabbi Chiya %0a%3c exists in a physical body of our world, in the property of this world), for if he %0a%3c had merited the appearance of Matat and his oath, he had attained the degree %0a%3c of complete correction of all his evil. And since he merited seeing the Mashiach's %0a%3c face, to receive the Light of Yechida, he had obviously completed his work in this %0a%3c world, and there is nothing left for him to do here. Hence, he should leave it %0a%3c and enter Rabbi Shimon's assembly in the Garden of Eden. %0a%3c %0a%3c But Rabbi Shimon persuaded Rabbi Chiya that he needs to continue %0a%3c performing new, additional corrections in this world. And both the Mashiach %0a%3c and Rabbi Shimon explained to Rabbi Chiya what else specifically he still %0a%3c needed to do in this world. %0a%3c %0a%3c 60. Rabbi Chiya trembled in awe when the Mashiach left, and his eyes fulfilled %0a%3c with tears. For the Mashiach left Rabbi Shimon's Assembly weeping from the %0a%3c great desire for the final correction and redemption. And Rabbi Chiya was also %0a%3c anguished from the fervent desire to reach the end of correction. Rabbi Chiya %0a%3c cried and said: "Happy is the lot of the righteous in the other world, and happy %0a%3c is the lot of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai, who has merited all of this." %0a\ No newline at end of file%0a
