That being said, the term 'Donum' or 'donum' or 'DONUM' 'Donumus' 'Domuni' or any combination of capitalizations is not trademarked and the term can be used for any other thing for any purpose.  But when we are referring to the donum described below, it covers all specified and non-specified versions and denominations.%0a%0a#Obverse must contain word 'Donum' or 'One Donum' (aka donum or one donum) or '1/4 Donum' or 'Quarter Donum' (aka quarter donum or quarter)  or '1/16 Donum' or 'Sixteenth Donum' (aka sixteenth donum or sixteenth or teenth) or whatever the name and amounts are decided to be and must be easily human legible from 1 foot distance from the eye, unassisted with 20/20 vision. Must have a 'U' (for uncia [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncia_%2528unit%2529|#]]) if inch is used or a 'M' if metric is used; the font size must be at least 1/3 as large for U or M as what is used for 'Donum'. Any other design that is desired can be included.%0a%0a#Reverse may be blank or contain any design desired, may be an advertisement or promotion.%0a%0a##This was done so that you only really need to have one spacer engraved.  Of course you can have no engraved spacers and engrave after the greenform is produced, even hand scribing is ok.%0a%0a#Diameter (at every point - it must be a circle or highly approximate one, reeding or texturing or inscribing the rim is allowable and the diameter would be measured at the largest diameter points along the rim) must be either 1" +/- 1/128" (Version U) or 25mm +/- 0.2mm (Version M) for 1/4 Donum, or 2" +/- 1/128" (Version U) or 50mm +/- 0.2mm (Version M) for Donum, or 1/2" +/- 1/128" (Version U) or 13mm +/- 0.2mm (Version M) for 1/16 Donum.  For special versions, see below.%0a%0a##You may have noticed that there is a very small window between U and M tolerance allowances.  If you can make one that measures between the spec's, you unlock a special achievement.  If the object is closer to the metric dimension it can be labeled 'MU', or if it is closer to the inch spec then it can be labeled 'UM'.  This would probably only be able to be achieved with custom made die's.  For example if the quarter was between 25.2 mm and 25.2015625mm.  As a random example if it measures in at 25.2011 it would be UM and if it measured 25.2001 it would be MU.%0a%0a##This was decided by the most common die sets and also so that each object area is multiples of 4 of each other.%0a%0a##Reason why imperial and metric units are both acceptable is they are such similar sizes and so that no die's are wasted.%0a%0a#Thickness must be 3.175mm (1/8") +/- 0.05mm (1/512") for the quarter, 5.137mm +/- 0.05mm (1/512") for the full, and 1.962mm +/- 0.05mm (1/512") for the sixteenth.  85.4%25 of the outer 1mm/2mm/4mm (for 13/25/50mm objects respectively) along the rim (measured inward from largest diameter points), hereby called the "rim", must entirely be this thickness (reeding or other texturing the outer rim/edge is allowable as long as 85.4%25 of the rim surface area and volume is completely filled to compression pressure).  The rest of the object can be embossed/etched/cutout just as long as 85.4%25+ of the total volume is solid, see below point.%0a%0a##This was decided by the golden ratio and common thicknesses like ~3mm for silver eagles and ~5.5mm for poker buttons [[https://warriorchip.com/custom-military-poker-chips-products/2-inch-49mm-51mm-ceramic-challenge-coin-military-poker-chip/|#]] [[https://abcgiftsandawards.com/49mm-custom-poker-chips/|#]] and 2mm is common for coins.  Also it was decided that having different thicknesses would be good for different uses, like different voltages if used as a dielectric.%0a%0a#Volume must be greater than 85.4%25 filled to compacting pressure, or if actual melting temperatures are achieved then the volume must likewise be over 85.4%25 filled.  Cutouts and embossing/engraving is allowed as long as the outermost 2mm is the proper thickness completely, and over 85.4%25 of the ideal volume is filled to compacting pressure, this includes volume lost due to optional reeding [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reeding|#]] or otherwise texturing of the outer rim of the object.%0a%0a#Compacting pressure must be greater than or equal to 12,000 psi (or alternatively - fully melted).  This would require a 5 ton press for the 1/4 donum, a 20 ton press for 1 donum, or a 1.3 ton press for 1/16 donum.  Vacuum and/or heated press dies are encouraged but not required as long as the other specifications are met.%0a%0a#Material must be primarily non-metallic; either compounds of any elements (transitional metals are ok as long as they are compounds and not pure metals), or metalloids, or other elements.  No pure metal element inclusions (like iron or brass, etc) larger than 1mm in largest diameter.  If granular or powdered metals are included, they must make up less than 38.2%25 of the solid volume.  Ingredients must be non-toxic to humans in the form and amounts they are present in the object, whether they are present as compounds or pure elements in the object.%0a%0a#Pellet may or may not be burned or fired or polished or otherwise treated with heat or anything else during or after the compression or melting of the object, as long as the specifications are met for the object post-treatment(s).  A chemical reaction (like ZnO and eugenol [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_impression#Zinc-oxide_eugenol_plaster_%2528impression_paste%2529|#]] or ash and clay), or a binder [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binder_%2528material%2529|#]] may be used especially if the object is not further treated by sintering or melted or any other process, as long as the finished object passes the below tests.  Note that the only process that negates the need for 12,000 psi compression is full melting, no other process can negate the need for compression regardless of whether the strength tests are met.%0a%0a#Finished object must have a tensile and compressive strength (measured everywhere on the object, including standing on every point of its rim) of at least 0.69 Mpa or 100 psi (psi calculated based on the full ideal cross sections, it would be 1/4 as strong as concrete [[http://soft-matter.seas.harvard.edu/index.php/Tensile_strength|#]] and as strong as brick [[https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Tensile-strength-of-bricks_fig4_321809293|#]]). Must resist 0.9%25 saline [[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26984838/|#]] solution at standard temperature and pressure (STP) submerged for 1 hour at a depth of 1 meter and afterward survive the strength tests wet as well as dried after being soaked in the saline according to specification.  Must pass all specifications mentioned in this point and elsewhere; before being soaked, immediately after soaking, and after soaking and full drying at STP.%0a%0a#Donum must be given away and not sold.  Not even traded for eachother nor for other goods or services.  Donations can be accepted. You can solicit payment for the service of making them, if they have not already been made previously.  This includes creating a machine that makes them on demand for a customer, a service charge can be solicited (but not of donum themselves, since donum can't be used as a payment method). The act of custom designing them for a customer can also solicit payment. Any donum that has already been made previously must be given for free or donation.%0a%0a!!!Notes%0a%0a85.4 is the [[golden ratio]] to the 4th power.%0a%0a%0a%0a!!Notes%0a%0a2mm Sacagawea dollar 2mm 10/128in Nickel 1.95mm%0a%0a25mm-15/128in-2.977mm: 3mm silver eagle 2.98mm 15/128in%0a%0a50mm-21/128in-4.167mm: 3.5mm poker chip 3.5mm 9/64in average 3.38mm 17/128in (perhaps 19/128in worth trying too, 21/128in is 1.382*15/128, 25/128in is 1.618*15/128)%0a%0aEjection spacer [[https://www.mcmaster.com/98049a121/|#]]%0a%0aPin [[https://www.mcmaster.com/5033N182/|#]]%0a%0aAdvertising/promotion. 1 side standard (various options) one side promo%0a%0aInoculated with mushroom spores, could grow mushrooms when added to water could hqve probiotics like l reuteri and b infantis [[https://www.naturehacker.org/2019/06/give-karma-open-source-coin-made-from.html|#]]%0a%0aCold iron [[https://www.naturehacker.org/2019/06/after-learning-what-i-have-about.html|#]]%0a%0aPerhaps peroxidize the clay by heating with 35%25 h2o2 [[https://www.naturehacker.org/2019/06/give-karma-open-source-coin-made-from.html|#]]%0a%0aOr use cellulose like cellulose powder or microcrystalline cellulose plain or peroxidized and/or treated with acetic acid or otherwise acetylated.
