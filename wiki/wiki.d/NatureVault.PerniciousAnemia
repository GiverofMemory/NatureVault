Make sure to record all the patients symptoms whether or not they are related to the standard known symptoms of B12 deficiency.

If no then test serum b12 and urinary or plasma [[methylmelonic acid]].  If serum B12 is below 400 [[https://www.mayocliniclabs.com/test-catalog/Clinical+and+Interpretive/9154|#]] OR urinary mma is elevated then continue workup to step 3.  If they have not taken a supplement and serum B12 tests over 400 and urinary MMA is not elevated then consider other elements of the homocysteine pathway in step 3.  If they have taken a supplement go to step 3 with or without testing serum b12 and regardless of what the serum b12 or urinary mma results are.  Educate the patient on sources of B12 [[https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/the-a-list-for-vitamin-b-12-sources|#]] including clams, red meat especially liver, pork, fish, milk, cheese, yogurt, turkey, crab, and vegan sources like Nori and nutritional yeast as well as fortified foods like some breakfast cereal and vegan milks.  Also educate the patient about [[h pylori]] infection and symptoms and how it can be involved with b12 deficiency (and what tests and treatments apply to the infection, [[campylobacter]] should always be treated for simultaneously as h pylori).  Also educate the patient about [[intrinsic factor]] and that it may not be working properly which can mean that even with proper nutrition your body may not absorb enough b12 from foods and multivitamins (and what tests can apply).  Also educate the patient that methylcobalamin is the only naturally active form of b12 and that cyanocobalamin in cheap supplements may not be able to be utilized properly by the body [[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20632110/|#]]. Also educate the patient that as the therapy begins there may be an increase in clinical symptoms which should go away over time.%0a%0a# Test patient for [[holotranscobalamin]], [[methylmalonic acid]], and [[homocysteine]].  If any 2 are problematic or just holotranscobalamin alone then continue to step 4.  If not then continue workup to other causes.  If [[homocysteine]] alone is elevated consider [[folic acid]], [[serine]], [[zinc]], [[pyridoxine]], [[riboflavin]], [[thiamine]], [[vitamin d]], [[retinol]], [[selenium]], [[calcium]], [[magnesium]] in the workup.%0a%0a# Administer a short term test prescription for oral b12 therapy (5mg methylcobalamin and/or hydroxocobalamin per day) or injectable b12 (1mg methylcobalamin or hydroxocobalamin once per week), whichever route the patient desires however they need to pick one of those two options, not both.  Methylcobalamin is the most natural and will help those with methylation problems and hydroxocobalamin might help others more probably if they have been exposed to toxins that it helps to detox. The clinician can rather design their own protocol if they want instead, for example one shot and then oral B12 for the remainder of the month or something similar.  Follow up in 1 month, ask the patient about their compliance with the treatment, and perform a retest of [[holotranscobalamin]], [[methylmalonic acid]], and [[homocysteine]]. If the patient improves then make the diagnosis of pernicious disorder (or symptomatic B12 deficiency) and continue therapy as long as the patient desires, 1-5mg methylcobalamin orally per day or 1mg methylcobalamin injection per month.  If homocysteine is still problematic consider other factors in the homocysteine pathway seen in step 3.%0a%0a# Once a year retest [[holotranscobalamin]], [[methylmalonic acid]], and [[homocysteine]] to tune treatment.%0a%0a!!!notes%0a%0aThis guideline protocol also lends itself well to clinical case study research.%0a%0aInjection frequency [[https://www.invigormedical.com/lifestyle/b12-injections-how-often-should-you-take-them/|#]]%0a%0aClinical factsheet [[https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminB12-HealthProfessional/|#]]%0a%0aMore food sources [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_B12#Animal-derived_foods|#]]%0a%0aNatural B12 forms like methyl and adenosyl are more prone to degradation so commercial products may not contain all of what is listed.%0a%0aHydroxo and cyano might also lower methylation for over methylators [[https://trashplanetdiy.com/three-fingered-mummy-maria-from-peru-from-an-alien-turns-into-a-kind-of-person-unknown-to-science.html|#]]%0a%0a[[Cobalamin]] injections cause [[Acne]] probably because they help the body fight the [[p acnes]] bacteria better causing inflammation [[https://healthunlocked.com/pasoc/posts/138415141/sleep-apnea-test-out-patient|#]]%0a!!Animals%0a%0aNon-ruminants like horses [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruminant|#]] are suseptible to parasites like [[strongyloides]] for which [[ivermectin]] is prescribed, likely because they are deficient in [[cobalamin]] [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_B12#Bacteria_and_archaea|#]]%0a%0a!!Mechanism%0a%0aThe mechanism of why [[cobalamin]] deficiency causes all these symptoms is mostly due to the body bieng unable to effectively fight or repair the damage of several types of bacteria without B12.  Likely [[campylobacter]], [[h pylori]], [[mycobacterium]], [[bacillus]], and [[intracellular bacteria]] like [[brucella]] and others, [[lactic acid bacteria]] like [[leuconostoc]], [[gram negative]] bacteria like [[e coli]], and possibly [[fusobacterium]] and [[clostridium]], and [[listeria]], and [[haemophilus]] and [[toxoplasma]], and [[pseudomonas]].  Parasites such as [[strongyloides]] and others probably too.  One mechanism of this inability to fight microbes may be due to thinning of epithelium - probably due to elevated [[homocysteine]] or [[methylmalonic acid]].%0a!!Resources%0a[[https://b12awareness.org|#]]
