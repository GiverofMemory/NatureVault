Awoke with [[Dysphagia]], [[hypothermia]], irregular heartbeat [[heart palpitations]], [[panic]], [[dry mouth]], [[stiff neck]]/pain (could be neck [[abscess]] from melioidosis) , had eaten about 1 cup refried beans with garlic, spoonful maple syrup and ice cream, short term memory loss, slight twitching of face muscles, slight pressure 3rd eye region forehead, spiritual feeling. Treated wjth activated charcoal, calcium, potassium, water and warmth (which worked fine, mostly probably the re-hydration and activated charcoal to bind the bacteria in the gut). Had been taking substantial doses (2g which is 1 tsp) on and off for a few weeks to treat constipation (constipation can breed lots of gut bacteria too), this is why took calcium to balance. Can't smell gas but there is gas. Feeling of calm and drowsiness, resisting urge to fall asleep since I had an irregular heartbeat. Seems like slight blood clots present in body and head. Smell sort of like the dmt smell (but not that smell exactly) might have been sensed a couple times. My thought is it is most likely related to the beans eaten so perhaps dehydration mixed with favism sensitivity to beans as well as some bacteria (perhaps stentrophomonas?). This would make sense because pseudomonas (relative) produces the DMT smell, and stentrophomonas also cauzes hypothermia. Wanted to move eyes up like another sickness I had. Eyes have patchy dryness. I think I had this bacteria on the side of the mouth a few days ago and produces severe dryness then cracking. Wet cough. Voice slightly affected. Smoke inhalation recently. Vision seems to have increased ghost image from looking at bright things, tnis could be considered light sensitivity [[https://www.cdc.gov/glanders/symptoms/index.html|#]] Was exposed to strange greenish onion that was very tough, perhaps thats where I got it [[https://microbewiki.kenyon.edu/index.php/Burkholderia_cepacia|#]] or from fresh raw garlic I ate that was probably exposed to manure. It is possiboe this is to blame for my similar night terror (accompanied by tachycardia, not arhythmia unlike this time) which happened when I had been working on an organic farm. There I was told something similar happened to person and it was diagnosed post mortem as fast acting liver cancer. This makes sense because pseudomonas can destrpy soft tissue. Also I believe that was the person that had been eating lots of raw potatoes so they certainly got exposed worse. After treatment said above and sleep, right hand numbness upon waking, probably from altered cardiac function.%0a%0aH pylori and chlamydia linked to atrial fibrillation [[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18163009/|#]]%0a%0aBlood clots linked to pseudomonas [[https://www.findatopdoc.com/Healthy-Living/blood-clot-risk-in-children-with-cystic|#]] which is linked to [[cystic fibrosis]].%0a%0aPseudomonas produces leucocidin which can cause [[arrhythmia]] [[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/133294/|#]]%0a%0aGarloc fights [[pseudomonas]] and [[staphylococcus]] [[https://phys.org/news/2017-11-garlic-chronic-infections.html|#]]%0a%0aPseudomonas closely related to [[burkholderia]] which causes [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melioidosis|#]] mimics [[tuberculosis]]. Diabetes is a risk factor (link to eating maple syrup before bed), increased rainfall and other weather events like thunderstorms linked. Takes 9 days to colonize body on average, range is 1-24 days. It also has a strong smell (link to dmt smell). Well known usage as a [[bioweapon]]. Appear to dry the agar plate [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melioidosis#Culture|#]] which makes sense as it severely dried out my mouth area. One of the tretment drugs should not be used in [[g6pd]] deficiency, so that could be a link with this crisis happening after I ate lots of beans. May contaminate aromatherapy products from india or perhaps other medicinal herbs. Perhaps it came from thyme essential oil, or dioxin fallout from ohio, or contaminated smoking material, or . [[thallesmia]] is a risk factor, what about [[hemachromatosis]]? Causes bacterial rot of onion bulb [[https://microbewiki.kenyon.edu/index.php/Burkholderia_cepacia|#]] and have been exposed to onions and garlic lately including garlic powder. Could be spread by animal manure on onions [[https://www.health.ny.gov/diseases/communicable/glanders/fact_sheet.htm|#]]. Also can cause fever with chills, definilty got vhills not so much fever, perhaps slight. Causes [[diahrrea]], maybe it can also cause constipation in certain circumstances like [[c difficile]] can? Muscle weakness also a symptom I experiemced. Known as a bioweapon [[https://emergency.cdc.gov/agent/agentlist-category.asp|#]]. Can cause [[siezure]] [[https://dermnetnz.org/topics/melioidosis|#]] differential diagnosis. Polymerizes actin to move within cells. Since [[fauci]] had us researching actin in the heart, perhaps he was gain of functioning this bacteria for release. %0a%0aPseudomonas can cause [[dysphagia]] and voice changes (both symptoms I had) [[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33370978/|#]] also was from chronic smoker and I have smoked recently.%0a%0aPseudomonas can cause what appears to be [[cancer]] including erosion of [[thyroid]] cartailage.%0a%0aGlanders similar to melioidosis and big in horses [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glanders|#]]. Horses also eat lots of oats, and I have been eating lots of oats recently. Well known usage as a [[bioweapon]].%0a%0aBioweapon agent list [[https://emergency.cdc.gov/agent/agentlist-category.asp|#]]%0a%0aB cepacia is the one on plant roots and onions and actually braks down chlorinated compounds in soil so this may have been from dioxins and other contaminants from east palestine [[https://microbewiki.kenyon.edu/index.php/Burkholderia_cepacia|#]] has [[serine protease]] much like [[enterococcus]] and I have noticed the enhanced energy / insomnia of enterococcus lately but with drowsiness too. Serine protease cause intraellular invasion. So if you take a [[serine protease]] inhibitor and it helps, then you have intracellular bacteria infection. Also the serpin allows bacteria to use [[ferritin]] as an iron source [[https://microbewiki.kenyon.edu/index.php/Burkholderia_cepacia|#]], which is elevated in [[iron overload]]. Common in [[cystic fibrosis]] patients and is detrimental like [[pseudomonas]]. Forms strong biofilms with cepacian, which I have noticed I have also noticed the biofilms are very drying. It actually prodices [[salicylic acid]] which may be why I feel drowzy since salicylic acid is a [[COX]] inhibitor and prpbably helps fight enterococcus. These bacteria bind to [[mucus]] glycoproteins. Has a [[lipase]] more [[methanol]] resistant than any others making uit useful to make biodiesel. Phyllosilicate sodium clay sol-gel. It detoxifies agent orange, so yes this organism probably went up with the smoke in east palestine as it was used to try to biodegrade the vinyl chloride.
