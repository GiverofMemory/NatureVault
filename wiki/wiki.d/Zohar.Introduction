text=Introduction %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Book of Zohar narrates that Rabbi Shimon Bar-Yochai (Rashbi) and his son, %0aRabbi Aba, attained the level of Prophet Eliyahu (Elijah). Hence, it is said that %0aEliyahu himself visited their cave and taught them the Torah. (Incidentally, the %0acave in the village of Peqi'in still exists today.) %0a%0aThe author of Divrey Yoel (The Words of Yoel) wrote the following in the book %0aThe Torah of Rashbi: "Before Rabbi Shimon studied the secrets of the Torah, %0athere was a rule in the cave— to settle disputes according to the opinion of Rabbi %0aYehuda, the author of the Talmud. However, after Rabbi Shimon left the cave, %0aeverything that he had written in The Zohar was considered to have exceeded all %0ahuman attainments." Rashbi himself received the name Butzina Kadisha (Holy %0aCandle), as he had attained the soul of Moshe (Moses). %0a%0aVerdicts on legislative and procedural matters are rendered in accordance %0awith the Talmud or The Book of Zohar, depending on where this matter is %0aexamined more strictly. If the matter is mentioned neither in the Talmud nor %0ain The Zohar, then the decision is based on the source that best elucidates this %0amatter. If the disputed matter is between the Talmud and the legislators, the %0adecision is based on the assertion from The Book of Zohar. If the legislators %0athemselves cannot come to an agreement on the matter in dispute, the decision %0ais based on the opinion of The Zohar (Mishna Brura, 25, 42). %0a%0aThe great follower of Rashbi, an heir (next receiver) to his soul, Rabbi Isaac %0aLuria (The Holy ARI) wrote that his soul was a return of the soul of Rabbi %0aShimon, and the soul of Rabbi Shimon was a return of the soul of Moshe %0a(Shaar HaGilgulim, item 64). He also wrote that the soul of Moshe clothed %0ain Rashbi to correct the soul of Achiya HaShiloni (Ahijah the Shilonite), who %0a"corrupted" Malchut on account of the sin of King Yerav'am (Jeroboam), which %0aprompted the transgression of all Israel. Hence, the soul of Rashbi appeared %0a%0a15 %0a%0a%0a%0a16 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0ato correct Israel's sins. The part of The Zohar titled Raya Meheimna (Loyal %0aShepherd) relates how Rashbi attained the soul of Moshe, merged with it, and %0aattained the supernal wisdom. %0a%0aIn his works Maranan ve Rahanan and Kli Yakar (Melachim, 2, 12), the great %0aHaChida also says that Rashbi's entire work lay in correction of the sin of %0aAchiya HaShiloni. %0a%0aAs Rashbi says in the Talmud (Sukkah, 45, 2): "I can redeem the entire %0aworld from judgment from the day of my birth to the present day. And if my %0ason is with me, from the day the world was created to the present day. And if %0aYotam Ben Uziyahu is with us, from the day the world was created to its end." %0aThe book of Melachim narrates about Yotam Ben Uziyahu (20, 15). %0a%0aAfter the verdict was lifted, Rashbi founded his seminary in the settlement %0aof Tekoa and in the village of Meron. There he taught his disciples Kabbalah %0aand wrote The Book of Zohar, thereby revealing what was forbidden to reveal from %0athe time of Israel's reception of the Torah (Tikuney Zohar, Hakdamah, p. 17). %0a%0aHowever, to write down all the secrets of the Torah, Rabbi Shimon had %0ato express them in a secret form. Rashbi's disciple, Rabbi Aba, had a unique %0aquality to his soul. This quality enabled him to convey spiritual knowledge in %0aa secret, concealed form. Hence, Rabbi Shimon asked his disciple to express %0ahis thoughts for him, that is, to commit Rashbi's thoughts to paper. The ARI %0aexplained it in the following way: "The Book of Zohar must remain concealed %0auntil the generation of the coming of the Mashiach (Messiah), as through the %0astudy of this book will humankind return from its spiritual exile" (The ARI, %0aShaar HaHakdamot, Hakdamah, p. 3). That is why Rabbi Aba wrote the teachings %0aof Rabbi Shimon in Aramaic, as it is the reverse side of Hebrew. %0a%0aThe ARI wrote (Maamarey Rashbi (Articles of Rashbi), p. 100) that the writing %0aof The Zohar in a secret form was possible because the soul of Rabbi Aba %0aoriginated from the Surrounding Light, and not from the Inner Light. For this %0areason, the ARI explained, he could express the most supernal wisdom in a %0asecret form as simple stories. %0a%0a(Rabbi Shimon lived approximately to the age of eighty and passed away on %0athe holiday of Lag BaOmer, the eighteenth day in the month lyar, surrounded by %0ahis disciples, and recognized by the entire nation. This day is celebrated as the %0aholiday of Light. Rabbi Shimon's body was buried in a cave off Mount Meron, %0aand the body of his son, Rabbi Elazar, is buried a few meters from him.) %0a%0aLike the subsequent compositions of the ARI and other Kabbalists (evidently, %0asuch is the lot of all true spiritual books), The Book of Zohar was concealed for %0a%0a%0a%0aIntroduction %0a%0a%0a%0a17 %0a%0a%0a%0asome 1,100 years in a cave near Meron, since the day it was written, until an %0aArab man found it and sold it in the market as wrapping cloth. %0a%0aPart of the torn sheets fell into the hands of a sage, who recognized and %0aappreciated the value of the writings. After a long search, he recovered many %0asheets from refuse bins or bought them from spice vendors, who were selling %0atheir merchandise wrapped in the sheets of The Zohar. It was out of these %0arecovered sheets that the book (as we know it today) was compiled. %0a%0aFor many centuries, since that time until today, The Book of Zohar has been %0athe subject of controversy. Philosophers, scientists, and other "sages," still %0adebate it today. Yet, the fact remains that only a Kabbalist, one who ascends to a %0aparticular spiritual degree, attains what this book conveys. To all other people, it %0aseems like a collection of narratives, stories, and ancient philosophy. Only those %0awho do not comprehend this book argue over it; but Kabbalists know for certain %0athat Rashbi's book is the greatest source of spiritual attainment that the Creator %0aimparted upon the people in this world. %0a%0aAlthough The Book of Zohar was written in the second century, only Rabbi %0aYehuda Ashlag was able to provide a full commentary on it in the 1930s-40s. The %0areason for the concealment of The Zohar from the second century to thirteenth %0acentury and the lack of a complete commentary on it for eighteen centuries is %0aexplained in the "Introduction to the Book of Zohar." %0a%0aRabbi Ashlag called his commentary HaSulam (The Ladder) because by %0astudying it, one can ascend the spiritual degrees of attainment of the Upper %0aWorlds as one would climb a ladder in our world. Following the publishing of %0athe Sulam commentary, Rabbi Ashlag received the epithet Baal HaSulam (Owner %0aof the Ladder), as it is customary among sages of the Torah to call a person not %0aby his name, but according to his highest attainment. %0a%0aTHE BOOK OF ZOHAR CONTAINS: %0a%0a1. Hakdamat Sefer HaZohar (The Introduction of the Book of Zohar)— containing %0aseveral articles that fully reveal the inner meaning of the Torah. %0a%0a2. Sefer HaZohar (The Book of Zohar)— divided into parts and chapters that %0acorrespond to the weekly portions of the Torah: %0a%0aThe Book of Beresheet (Genesis): Beresheet, NoacK, Lech Lecha, Vayera, Chaiey %0aSarah, Toldot, Vayetze, Vayishlach, Vayeshev, Miketz, Vayigash, Vayichi. %0a%0aThe Book of Shemot (Exodus): Shemot, Vayera, Bo, Beshalach, Yitro, Mishpatim, %0aTerumah (Safra de Tzniuta), Tetzaveh, Ki Tissa, Veyikahel, Pekudey. %0a%0a%0a%0a18 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Book of Vayikra (Leviticus): Vayikra, Tzav, Shmini, Tazria, Metzura, %0aAcharey, Kedushim, Emor, BaHar, Vechukotay. %0a%0aThe Book of Bamidbar (Numbers): Bamidbar, Naso (Idra Raba), Baalotcha, %0aShlach Lecha, Korach, Chukat, Balak, Pinchas, Matot. %0a%0aThe Book of Devarim (Deuteronomy)'. VeEtchanen, Ekev, Shoftim, Titze, %0aVayelech, Haazinu (Idra Zuta). %0a%0a3. Zohar Hadash (The New Zohar): additions to the weekly chapters: %0a%0aBeresheet, Noach, Lech Lecha, Vayera, Vayetze, Vayeshev, Bashalach, Yitro, %0aTerumah, Ki Titze, Tzav, Acharey, BaHar, Naso, Chukat, Balak, Matot, VeEtchanen, %0aKi Titze, Ki Tavo. %0a%0a4. Additional books in The Book of Zohar that are not a direct commentary %0aon the Torah: %0a%0aIdra Raba, Idra Zuta, Safra de Tzniuta, Raza de Razin, Tosefta, Raya Mi'emna, %0aAshmatot, Sitrey Torah, Sitrey Otiot, and Tikuney Zohar. %0a%0a5. Midrash HaNe'elam (The Commentary on the Writings): Song of Songs, Ruth, %0aEicha (Lamentations)— and on the Torah (Pentateuch). %0a%0aBaal HaSulam wrote the commentary on the portions of The Zohar that %0aare known to us. His main commentaries in the "Introduction to the Book of %0aZohar" and the chapter "Beresheet" are expressed in terms of man's spiritual %0awork. The most valuable articles of The Zohar for the science of Kabbalah are %0aIdra Raba, Idra Zuta, and Safra de Tzniuta. All of them are expressed in the %0alanguage of Kabbalah. Besides these articles, the rest of The Zohar is written in %0athe language of Midrash. %0a%0aIn its original form, The Book of Zohar— written by Rabbi Aba sixteen centuries %0aago— was not divided into weekly chapters. Its volume was several times larger %0athan the text that reached us; it expounded not only the Torah, but also twenty- %0afour other books of the Bible (Pentateuch, Prophets, and Writings). %0a%0aBesides The Book of Zohar itself, Rabbi Shimon's book of Tikkunim (correc- %0ations) had reached us, as well. It comprises seventy commentaries on the first %0aword of the Torah, Beresheet (in the beginning), since it includes everything. %0a%0aThis book offers a semantic translation of The Zohar itself, Rabbi Yehuda %0aAshlag's The Sulam commentary, and my own explanations. The book also %0acontains the first part of The Book of Zohar— Hakdamat Sefer HaZohar (Introduction %0aof The Book of Zohar). %0a%0a%0a%0aIntroduction %0a%0a%0a%0a19 %0a%0a%0a%0aAt the beginning of the text, the semantic translation is given in bold script. %0aThe Sulam commentary and my explanations are in regular script or italics %0abecause it turned out to be extremely difficult to separate my explanations %0afrom Rabbi Ashlag's holy texts. The numbers at the beginning of the items %0acorrespond to the numbers of the items in The Book of Zohar with The Sulam %0acommentary, vol. 1. %0a%0aThe reason for the interlacing of texts is the need to explain the meaning %0aof The Zohar in several languages simultaneously: a) the language of Kabbalah %0a(Sefirot, Partzufim, Gematria, and worlds), b) the language of spiritual work %0a(emotions), c) the language of the Torah (narrative), and d) the language of the %0aTalmud (judicial). %0a%0a%0a%0a%0ato returr %0athe commentary. %0a%0aThe Book of Zohar, like the whole of the Torah, speaks exclusively of man %0a(creation) and his relationship with the Creator. The Torah attaches worldly %0aappellations to all of man's inner properties. Thus, the aspiration to the Creator %0ais called "Israel," and the aspiration to selfish reception of pleasures is called %0alations of the world." However, there is no connection whatsoe\ %0a%0avs and other nations in our work %0a%0a%0a%0a%0aThe book contains articles commented upon in the language of Kabbalah, %0aand others commented upon in the language of emotions, which is easier to %0aunderstand for the beginner. The reader can begin the study of the book with such %0aarticles as "Night of the Bride," and "Who rejoices on holidays." Nevertheless, %0aa complete study of The Zohar entails systematic learning of the material. The %0amore accustomed we are to Kabbalah, the more it permeates our hearts, and it %0acan only be mastered by repeatedly reviewing the studied material. %0a%0aRav Michael Laitman
