(1.) — UNGUENTS — AT WHAT PEEIOD THET WEEE FIEST %0aINTROBUCED. %0a%0aThus far we have been speaking of the trees which are %0avaluable for the odours they produce, and each of wliich is a %0asubject for our wonder in itself. Luxury, ho^'ever, has %0athought fit to mingle all of these, and to make a single odour %0aof the whole ; hence it is that unguents have been invented.^ %0a"Who was the first to make unguents is a fact not recorded. %0aIn the times of the Trojan war^ they did not exist, nor did %0athey use incense when sacrificing to the gods ; indeed, people %0aknew of no other smell, or rather stench,^ I may saj', than that %0aof the cedar and the citrus,* shrubs of their own growth, as it %0aarose in volumes of smoke from the sacrifices ; still, however, %0aeven then, the extract of roses was known, for we find it men- %0ationed as conferring additional value on olive-oil. %0a%0aWc ought, by good rights, to ascribe the first use of un- %0aguents to the Persians, for tlioy quite soak themselves in it, %0aand so, bj'' an adventitious recou^mcndation, counteract the %0abad odours which are produced by dirt. The first instance of %0athe use of unguents that I have been able to meet with is that of %0athe chest* of perfumes which fell into the hands of Alexander, %0aAvith the rest of the property of King Darius, at the taking of his %0a%0a' Fee remarks, that most of the unguents and perfumes of wliich Pliny %0ahere speaks Avould find but little favour at the present day. %0a%0a- This does not appear to be exactly the case, for in the twenty-third %0aBook of tlic Iliad, 1. 186, we P.ud "rose-scented" oil mentioned, indeed, %0aPliny himself alludes to it a little further on. %0a%0a•■' "Nidorem." This term was used in reference to the smell of burnt ot %0aroasted animal substances. It is not improbable that he alludes to the %0astencil arisinsr from tlio burnt sacrifices. %0a%0a* The " Thuya articulata."

Those perfumes which are not the produce of %0ashrubs'' will only be mentioned for the present by name : the %0anature of them will, however, be stated in their appropriate %0aplaces. %0a%0aCHAP. 2. — THE VAEIOirs KINDS OF UNGUENTS — TWELVE PEIN- %0aCIPAL COMPOSITIONS, %0a%0aThe names of unguents are due, some of them, to the ori- %0aginal place of their composition, others, again, to the extracts %0awhich form their bases, others to the trees from which they %0aare derived, and others to the peculiar circumstance under %0awhich they were first made : and it is as well, first of all, to %0aknow that in this respect the fashion has often changed, and %0athat the high repute of peculiar kinds has been but transitory. %0aIn ancient times, the perfumes the most esteemed of all were %0athose of the island of Delos,^ and at a later period those of %0aMendes.^ This degree of esteem is founded, not only on the %0amode of mixing them and the relative proportions, but accord- %0aing to the degree of favour or disfavour in which the various %0aplaces which produce the ingredients are held, and the compa- %0arative excellence or degeneracy of the ingi-edients themselves. %0aThe perfume of iris," from Corinth, was long held in the %0ahighest esteem, till that of Cyzicus came into fashion. It was %0athe same, too, with the perfume of roses," from Phaselis,^^ the %0a%0a« The use of perfumes more probably originated in India, than among %0athe Pei'sians. %0a%0aBut of seeds or plants %0a%0a* The perfumes of JJelos tbemselves had nothing in particular to re- %0acommend them ; but as it was tlie centre of the worship of Apollo, it is not %0aimprobable that exquisite perfumes formed a large proportion of the offer- %0aings brought thither from all parts of the world. %0a%0a8 In Egypt.

Oil of saffron/^ from Soli in Cilicia, %0awas for a long time held in repute beyond any other, and then %0athat from Rhodes ; after which perfume of cenanthe," from Cy- %0aprus, came into fashion, and then that of Egypt was preferred. %0aAt a later period that of Adramytteum came into vogue, and %0athen was supplanted by unguent of marjoram,'* from Cos, %0awhich in its turn was superseded by quince blossom'® unguent %0afrom the same place. As to perfume of Cyprus," that from %0athe island of Cyprus was at first preferred, and then that of %0aEgypt ; Avhen all on a sudden the unguents of Mendes and %0araetopium'* rose into esteem. In later times Phoenicia eclipsed %0aEgypt in the manufacture of these last two, but left to that %0acountry the repute of producing the best unguent of cyprus. %0a%0aAthens has perseveringly maintained the repute of her %0apanuthenaicon.'" There was formerly a famous unguent, %0aknown as " pardalium,"^" and made at Tarsus; at the present %0aday its very composition and the mode of mixing it are quite %0aunknown there : they have left off, too, making unguent of %0anarcissus from the flowers of that plant. %0a%0aThere are two elements which enter into the composition of %0aunguents, the juices and the solid parts. The former generally %0aconsist of various kinds of oils, the latter of odoriferous sub- %0astances. These last are known as hedysmata, while the oils %0aare called stymmata.^* There is a third element, which occu- %0a%0a" Crocinum ; made from the Crocus sativus of naturalists. %0a%0aSee B. xii. c. 62. It was made from the flowers of the vine, mixed %0awith omphaciiim. %0a%0aAmaracinum. The amaracus is supposed to have been the Origanum %0amajoranoides of the moderns.

To produce a colour, however, %0acinnabar^^ and alkanet^ are often employed. If salt"* is %0asprinkled in the oil, it will aid it in retaining its properties ; %0abut if alkanet has been employed, salt is never used. E-esin %0aand gum are added to fix the odour in the solid perfumes; %0aindeed it is apt to die away and disappear with the greatest %0arapidity if these substances are not employed. %0a%0aThe unguent which is the most readily prepared of all, %0aand indeed, in all probability, the very first that was ever %0amade, is that composed of bryon^" and oil of balanus,-' sub- %0astances of which we have made mention already. In later %0atimes the Mendesian unguent was invented, a more compli- %0acated mixture, as resin and myrrh were added to oil of ba- %0alanus, and at the present day they even add metopion^* as %0awell, an Egyptian oil extracted from bitter almonds ; to which %0ahavebeenaddedomphacium,^^cardamum,^° sweet rush,^'hone}'," %0awine, myrrh, seed of balsamum,^^ galbanum,^'' and resin ot %0aterebinth,^® as so many ingredients. Among the most common %0aunguents at the present day, and for that reason supposed to %0abe the most ancient, is that composed of oil of myrtle, cala- %0amus, cypress,^'' Cyprus, mastich,^** and pomegranate-rind.^^ I am %0ascented calamus and xylo-balsamum ; and among the hcdysmata amomura, %0anard, myrrh, balsam, costus, and marjoram. The latter constituted the %0abase of unguents, the former were only added occasionally. %0a%0a23 Cinnabar is never used to colour cosmetics at the present day, from %0aits tendency to excoriate the skin. See B. xxiii. c. 39. %0a%0a•* This is stUl used for colouring cosmetics at the present day. See B. %0axxii. c. 23. %0a%0a-5 Fee remarks, that salt can be of no use ; but by falling to the bottom %0awithout dissolving, would rather tend to spoil the unguent. %0a%0a-6 See B. xii. c. 60. The name "bryon " seems also to have been ex- %0atended to the buds of various trees of the Couifera class and of the white %0apoplar. It is probably to the buds of the last tree that Pliny here %0aalludes. ^'^ Oil of ben. See B. xii. c. 48. %0a%0aOr metopium. See Note 18 above. %0a%0a29 Made from olives.

The same %0ais the case, too, with oil of saffron, to which have been lately %0aadded cinnabar, alkanet, and wine ; and with oil of sampsuchum,^^ %0aAvith which omphacium and calamus have been compounded. %0aThe best comes from Cyprus and Mitylene, where sampsuchum %0aabounds in large quantities. %0a%0aThe commoner kinds of oil, too, are mixed with those of %0amyrrh and laurel, to which are added sampsuchum, lilies, %0afenugreek, myrrh, cassia,^^ nard,^^ sweet-rush, and cinnamon." %0aThere is an oil, too, made of the common quince and the %0asparrow quince, called melinum, as we shall have, occasion to %0amention hereafter ; it is used as an ingredient in unguents, %0amixed with omphacium, oil of Cyprus, oil of sesamum,**^ balsa- %0amum," sweet- rush, cassia, and abrotonum.*^ Susinum'*^ is %0athe most fluid of them all : -it is made of lilies, oil of balanus, %0acalamus, honey, cinnamon, saffron,^" and myrrh ; while the %0aunguent of Cyprus'^' is compounded of cyprus, omphacium %0a%0aThe alkanet and cinnabar were only used for colourini^. %0a*^ " Sarapsuchinum." It is generally supposed that the sampsuchum, %0aand the amaracus were the same, the sweet marjoram, or Origanum mar- %0ajorana of Linnaeus. Fee, however, is of a contrary opinion. See B. xxi. %0ac. 35.

There %0aare some persons who, when making unguent of Cyprus, em- %0aploy myrrh also, and panax : ^ the best is that made at Sidon, %0aand the next best that of Egypt : care must be taken not to %0aadd oil of scsamum : it will keep as long as four years, and its %0aodour is strengthened by the addition of cinnamon.

This last was %0athe perfume most in vogue in the time of the Comic poet %0aMenander: a considerable time after that known as " me- %0agalium" took its place, being so called as holding the very %0aliighest rank ; ^ it was composed of oil of balanus, balsamum, %0acalamus, sweet-rush, xylobalsamum,*^ cassia, and resin. One %0apeculiar property of this unguent is, that it requires to be %0aconstantly stirred while boiling, until it has lost all smell : %0awhen it becomes cold, it recovers its odour.®" %0a%0aThere are some single essences also which, individually, %0aafford unguents of very high character : the first rank is due %0ato malobathrum,®^ and the next to the iris of lUyricum and %0athe sweet marjoram of Cyzicus, both of them herbs. There %0aare perfumers who sometimes add some few other ingredients %0ato these : those who use the most, employ for the purpose %0ahoney, flour of salt, omphacium, leaves of agnus,*^ and panax, %0aall of them foreign ingredients.*' The price of unguent" of %0a%0a52 See B. xii. c. 52. %0a%0a^ The gum resin of the Pastinaca opopanax of Linnrcus.

All %0athese perfumes are rendered still more pungent by the addi- %0ation of costus and amomum, which have a particularly power- %0aful effect on the olfactory organs ; while myrrh gives them %0agreater consistency and additional sweetness, and saffron makes %0athem better adapted for medicinal purposes. They are most %0apungent, however, w^hen mixed with amomum alone, which %0awill often produce head-ache even. There are some persons who %0acontent themselves with sprinkling the more precious ingre- %0adients upon the others after boiling them down, for the pur- %0apose of economy ; but the strength of the unguent is not so %0agreat as when the ingredients have been boiled together. %0aMyrrh used by itself, and without the mixture of oil, forms %0aan imguent, but it is stacte"* only that must be used, for other- %0awise it will be productive of too great bitterness. Unguent of %0acy3)rus turns other unguents green, while lily unguent makes %0athem more unctuous : the unguent of Mendes turns them %0ablack, rose unguent makes them white, and that of myrrh %0aof a pallid hue. %0a%0aSuch are the particulars of the ancient inventions, and the %0avarious falsifications of the shops in later times ; we will now %0apass on to make mention of what is the very height of refine- %0ament in these articles of luxury, indeed, I may say, the beau %0aideal" of them all. %0aNardinum. %0a%0a88 Or leaf unguent, so called from being made of leaves of nard.

This is what is called the "regal" unguent, from Uie %0afact that it is composed in these proportions for the kings of %0athe Parthians. It consists of myrobalanus," costus, amomum, %0acinnamon, comacum,'^ cardamum, spikenard, marum, myrrh, %0acassia, storax,^* ladanum, opobalsamum, Syrian calamus" and %0aSyrian sweet-rush," oenanthe, malobatlirum, serichatum,'' %0aCyprus, aspralathus, panax, saffron, cypirus, sweet marjoram, %0alotus,** houey, and wine. Not one of the ingredients in this %0acompound is produced either in Italy, that conqueror of the %0aworld, or, indeed, in all Europe, with the exception of the %0airis, which grows in Illyricum, and the nard, which is to be %0afound in Gaul : as to the wine, the rose, the leaves of myr- %0atle, and the olive-oil, they are possessed by pretty nearly all %0acountries in common. %0a%0aCHAP. 3. DIAPASMA, MAGMA ; THE MODE OF TESTING UNGUENTS. %0a%0aThose unguents which are known by the name of " dia- %0apasma,"" are composed of dried perfumes. The lees of un- %0aguents are known by the name of " magma.®* " In all these %0apreparations the most powerful perfume is the one that is %0aadded the last of all. Unguents keep best in boxes of ala- %0abaster,** and perfumes'*' when mixed with oil, which conduces %0aall the more to their durability the thicker it is, such as the %0aoil of almonds, for instance. Unguents, too, improve with age ; %0abut the sun is apt to spoil them, for which reason they are %0ausually stowed away in a shady place in vessels of lead. %0aWhen their goodness is being tested, they are placed on the %0aback of the hand, lest the heat of the palm, which is more %0afleshy, should have a bad effect upon them. %0a%0a" See B. xii. c. 46.

THE EXCESSES TO WHICH LUXTJHT HAS ETIII IN %0a%0aUNGUENTS. %0a%0aThese perfumes form the objects of a luxury which may be %0alooked upon as being the most superfluous of any, for pearls %0aand jewels, after all, do pass to a man's representative, and %0agarments have some durability; but unguents lose their %0aodour in an instant, and die away the very hour they are %0aused. The very highest recommendation of them is, that %0awhen a female passes by, the odour which proceeds from her %0amay possibly attract the attention of those even who till then %0aare intent upon something else. In price they exceed so large %0aa sum even as four hundred denarii per pound : so vast is the %0aamount that is paid for a luxury made not for our own enjoy- %0ament, but for that of others ; for the person who carries the %0aperfume about him is not the one, after all, that smells it. %0a%0aAnd yet, even here, there are some points of difference that %0adeserve to be remarked. We read in the works of Cicero, " %0athat those unguents which smell of the earth are preferable to %0athose which smell of saffron ; being a proof, that even in a %0amatter which most strikingly bespeaks our state of extreme %0acorruptness, it is thought as well to temper the vice by a little %0ashow of austerity.^* There are some persons too who look more %0aparticularly for consistency®' in their unguents, to which they %0aaccordingly give the name of "spissum f^' thus showing that %0athey love not only to be sprinkled, but even to be plastered over, %0awith unguents. We have known the very soles ^ even of the %0afeet to be sprinkled with perfumes ; a refinement which was %0ataught, it is said, by M. Otho ^' to the Emperor Nero. "Eow, %0a%0a^ " Hercs." The person was so called who succeeded to the property, %0awhether real or personal, of an intestate. %0a%0aSee B. xvii. c. 3, where he quotes this passage from Cicero at length. %0aIt appears to be from De Orat. B. iii. c. 69. Both Cicero and Pliny pro- %0afess to find a smell that arises from the earth itself, through the agency of %0athe sun. But, as Fee remarks, pure earth is perfectly inodorous. He sug- %0agests, however, that this odour attributed by the ancients to the earth, may %0ain reality have proceeded from the fibrous roots of thyme and other plants. %0aIf such IS not the real solution, it seems impossible to suggest any other. %0aBy giving preference to the more simple odours. %0a" Crassitudo." "i** Or " thick " unguent. %0a%0a^ "We learn from Athcnaeus, and a passage in the Aulularia of Plautus, %0athat this was done long before Nero's time, among the Greeks. %0a%0aWho succeeded Galba.

It loves the vicinity of flowing %0awater ; and as it is its nature to imbibe the whole of the year, %0athere are some who are of opinion that in a year of drought %0ait will receive injury from being manured even, if the manure %0ais not first mixed with running water : this, at least, is the idea %0aentertained by some of the Assyrians. %0a%0aThe varieties of the palm are numerous. First of all, there %0aare those which do not exceed the size of a shrub ; they are %0amostly barren, though sometimes they are known to produce %0afruit ; the branches are short, and the tree is well covered with %0aleaves all round. In many places this tree is used as a kind %0aof rough-cast," as it were, to protect the walls of houses %0aagainst damp. The palms of greater height form whole %0aforests, the trunk of the tree being protected all round by %0apointed leaves, which are arranged in the form of a comb ; %0athese, it must be understood, are wild palms, though sometimes, %0aby some wajnvard fancy or other, they are known to make %0atheir appearance among the cultivated varieties. The other %0akinds are tall, round, and tapering ; and being furnished with %0adense and projecting knobs or circles in the bark, arranged in %0aregular gradation, they are found easy of ascent by the people %0ain the East ; in order to do which, the climber fastens a loop %0aof osier round his body and the trunk, and by this contrivance %0aascends the tree with astonishing rapidity. All the foliage is %0aat the summit, and the fruit as well ; this last being situate, %0anot among the leaves, as is the case with other trees, but %0ahanging in clusters from shoots of its own among the %0abranches, and partaking of the nature both of the grape and %0athe apple. The leaves terminate in a sharp edge, like that of %0aa knife, while the sides are deeply indented — a peculiarity %0a%0aOr in a wild state. %0a" " Tectorii vicem." They were probably planted in rows, close to the %0awall. %0a%0a" This mode of ascending the date-palm is still practised in the East. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. :.] %0a%0a%0a%0aTHE PALM-TREE. %0a%0a%0a%0a171 %0a%0a%0a%0aAvhich first gave the idea of a troop of soldiers presenting face %0aoil two sides at once ; at the present day they are split asunder^^ %0ato form ropes and wythes for fastening, as well as light um- %0abrellas'* for covering the head. %0a%0aThe more diligent'^ enquirers into the operations of Nature %0astate that all trees, or rather all plants, and other productions %0aof the earth, belong to either one sex or the other ; a fact %0awhich it may be sufficient to notice on the present occasion, %0aand one which manifests itself in no tree more than in the %0apalm. The male tree blossoms at the shoots ; the female buds %0awithout blossoming, the bud being very similar to an ear of %0acorn. In both trees the flesh of the fruit shows first, and %0aafter that the woody part inside of it, or, in other words, the %0aseed : and that this is really the case, is proved by the fact, that %0awe often find small fruit on the same shoot without any seed in %0ait at all. This seed is of an oblong shape, and not rounded %0alike the olive-stone. It is also divided down the back by a %0adeep indentation, and in most specimens of this fruit there %0ais exactly in the middle a sort of navel, as it were, from which %0athe root of the tree first takes its growth.'® In planting this %0aseed it is laid on its anterior surface, two being placed side %0aby side, while as many more are placed above ; for when %0aplanted singly, the tree that springs up is but weak and %0asickly, whereas the four seeds all unite and form one strong %0atree. The seed is divided from the flesh of the fruit bj^ several %0acoats of a whitish colour, some of which are attached to the %0abody of it ; it lies but loosely in the inside of the fruit, ad- %0aliering only to the summit by a single thread." %0a%0aThe flesh of this fruit takes a year to ripen, though in some %0aplaces, Cyprus'® for instance, even if it should not reach ma- %0aturity, it is very agreeable, for the sweetness of its flavour : %0athe leaf of the tree too, in that island, is broader than else- %0awhere, and the fruit rounder than usual : the body of the fruit %0a%0a" See B. xvi. c. 37. %0a%0a" "Umbracula." The fibres of the leaves were probably platted or woven, %0aand the " umbracula" made in much the same manner as the straw and %0afibre hats of the present day. %0a%0a•5 Most of this is borrowed from Theophrastus, Hist. Plant, ii. 9. %0a%0a'® Fee remarks, that this account is quite erroneous. %0a%0a" This he copies also from Theophrastus, B. ii. c. 8. %0a%0a'* Theophrastus, B. ii. c. 8, mentions this as a kind of date peculiar to %0aCyprus. %0a%0a%0a%0a172 %0a%0a%0a%0aPliny's natuiial history. %0a%0a%0a%0a[Book XIII. %0a%0a%0a%0ahowever, is never eaten, but is always spif out again, after %0athe juice has been extracted. In Arabia, the pahn fruit is %0asaid to have a sickly sweet taste, although Juba says that he %0aprefers the date found among the Arabian ScenitEe,'-" and to %0awhich they give the name of "dablan," before those of any %0aother country for flavour. In addition to the above parti- %0aculars, it is asserted that in a forest of natural growth the %0afemale-^ trees will become barren if they ai'c deprived of the %0amales, and that many female trees may be seen surrounding a %0asingle male with downcast heads and a foliage that seems to be %0abowing caressingly towards it ; while the male trcoj on the %0aother hand, with leaves all bristling and erect, by its exha- %0alations, and even the very sight of it and the dust^' from %0aoff it, fecundates the others : if the male tree, too, should %0ahappen to be cut down, the female trees, thus reduced to a state %0aof widowhood, will at once become barren and unproductive. %0aSo well, indeed, is this sexual union between them understood, %0athat it has been imagined even that fecundation may be en- %0asured through the agency of man, by means of the blossoms %0aand the down^^ gathered from off the male trees, and, indeed, %0asometimes by only sprinkling the dust from off them on the %0afemale trees. %0a%0aCHAP. 8. — HOW THE PALM-TREE IS PLANTED. %0a%0aPalm-trees are also propagated by planting ; the trunk is %0afirst divided with certain fissures two cubits in length which %0acommunicate with the pith of the tree, and is then buried in %0athe earth. A slip also torn away from the root will produce %0aa sucker with vitality, and the same may be obtained from the %0amore tender among the branches. In Assyria, the tree itself %0a%0aThis is said solely in relation to the date of Cyprus. %0a%0a20 Or " dwellers in tents;" similar to the modern Bedouins. %0a%0a21 Fee remarks, that in these words we find the first germs of the sexual %0asystem that has been established by the modern botanists.

See the last Note. %0a%0a23 "Lanugine." It is possible that in the use of this word, also, he %0amay allude to the pollen. Under the term "pulvis," "dust," he probably %0aalludes in exaggerated terms to the same theory. %0a%0a2* The same methods of propagating the palm are still followed in the %0aEast, and in the countries near the tropics. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 9.] %0a%0a%0a%0aPALM-TBEES. %0a%0a%0a%0a173 %0a%0a%0a%0ais sometimes laid level, and then covered over in a moist soil ; %0aupon which it will throw out roots all over, but it will grow %0aonly to be a number of shrubs, and never a tree : hence it is %0athat they plant nurseries, and transplant the young trees when %0aa year old, and again when two years old, as they thrive all %0athe better for being transplanted ; this is done in the spring %0aseason in other countries, but in Assyria about the rising of the %0aDog-star. In those parts they do not touch the young trees %0awith the knife, but merely tie up the foliage that they may %0ashoot upwards, and so attain considerable height. When %0athey are strong they prune them, in order to increase their %0athickness, but in so doing leave the branches for about half a %0afoot ; indeed, if they were cut off at any other place, the ope- %0aration would kill the parent tree. We have already men- %0ationed that they thrive particularly well in a saltish soil ; %0ahence, when the soil is not of that nature, it is the custom to %0ascatter salt, not exactly about the roots, but at a little distance %0aoff. There are palm-trees in Syria and in Egypt which divide %0ainto two ti'unks, and some in Crete into three and as many as %0afive even.'^ Some of these trees bear immediately at the end of %0athree years, and in Cyprus, Syria, and Egypt, when they are %0afour years old ; others again at the end of five years : at which %0al)eriod the tree is about the height of a man. So long as the %0atree is quite young the fruit has no seed within, from which %0acircumstance it has received the nickname of the " eunuch."" %0a%0aCHA.P. 9. — THE DIFFERENT VARIETIES OF PALM-TREES, AND THELK %0aCHARACTERISTICS. %0a%0aThere are numerous varieties of the palm-tree. In Assyria, %0aand throughout the whole of Persis, the barren kinds are made %0ause of for carpenters' work, and the various appliances of %0aluxury. There are whole forests also of palm-trees adapted %0afor cutting,-* and which, after they are cut, shoot again from %0a%0aIn c. 7 of the present Book.

The name of this tree is "chamajreps %0ait has a broader and softer leaf than the others, which is ex- %0atremely useful for various kinds of wickerwork these trees are %0avery numerous in Crete, and even more so in Sicily. The %0awood of the palm-tree, when ignited, burns both brightly and %0aslowly.^* In some of those that bear fruit, the seed of the fruit %0ais shorter than in others, while in some, again, it is longer ; in %0asome it is softer than in others, and in some harder ; in some %0ait is osseous and crescent-shaped ; polished with a tooth, super- %0astition employs the stone as an antidote against charms and fas- %0acination. This stone is enclosed in several coats, more or less %0ain number ; sometimes they are of a thick texture, and some- %0atimes very thin. %0a%0aHence it is that we find nine and forty different kinds of %0apalm-trees, if any one will be at the trouble of enumerating all %0atheir various barbarous names, and the different wines that are %0aextracted from them. The most famous of all, are those %0awhich, for the sake of distinction, have received the name of %0a"royal" palms, because they were preserved solely by the %0akings of Persia ; these used to grow nowhere but at Babylon, %0aand there only in the garden of Bagous,^* that being the %0aPersian for an eunuch, several of whom have even reigned %0aover that country !

These last are short, white, %0aand round, and bear a stronger resemblance to grapes than to %0adates ; for which reason it is that they have received their %0aname, in consequence of their close resemblance to " marga- %0aritae," or pearls. It is said that there is only one tree that %0abears them, and that in the locality known as Chora." The %0asame is the case also with the tree that bears the syagri. "We %0ahave heard a wonderful story too, relative to this last tree, to %0athe effect that it dies and comes to life again in a similar %0amanner to the phoenix, which, it is generally thought, has %0aboiTowed its name fi-om the palm-tree, in consequence of this %0apeculiarity ; at the moment that I am writing this, that tree %0ais still bearing fruit. As for the fruit itself, it is large, hard, %0aand of a rough appearance, and differing in taste from all other %0akinds, having a sort of -wild flavour peculiar to itself, and %0anot unlike that of the flesh of the wild boar ; it is evidently %0athis circumstance from which it has derived its name of %0a" syagrus." %0a%0aIn the fourth rank are the dates called " sandalides," from %0atheir resemblance to a sandal in shape. It is stated, that on %0athe confines of Ethiopia there are but five of these trees at %0athe most, no less remarkable for the singular lusciousness of %0atheir fruit, than for their extreme rarity. Next to these, the %0adates known as "caryotae are the most esteemed, affording %0anot only plenty of nutriment, but a great abundance of juice ; %0ait is from these that the principal wines^® are made in the %0aEast ; these wines are apt to affect the head, a circumstance %0afrom which the fruit derives its name. But if these trees are %0aremarkable for their abundance and fruitfulness, it is in Judaea %0athat they enjoy the greatest repute ; not, indeed, throughout %0athe whole of that territory, but more particularly at Hiericus,^" %0aalthough those that grow at Archelals, Phaselis, and Livias, %0avaliies in the same territory, are highly esteemed.

The Nicolaan" %0adates are of a similar kind, but somewhat drier; they are %0aof remarkable size, so much so, indeed, that four of them, %0aplaced end to end, will make a cubit in length. A less line %0akind, but of sister quality to the caryotse for flavour, are the %0a" adeljihides,"^^ hence so called ; these come next to them in %0asweetness, but still are by no means their equals. A third %0akind, again, are the patetce, which abound in juice to excess, %0aso much so, indeed, that the fruit bursts, in its excess of liquor, %0aeven upon the parent tree, and presents all the appearance of %0ahaving been trodden^'' under foot. %0a%0aThere are numerous kinds of dates also, of a drier nature, %0awhich are long and slender, and sometimes of a curved shape. %0aThose of this sort which we consecrate to the worship of the %0agods are called " chydaei by the Jews, a nation remarkable %0afor the contempt which they manifest of the divinities. Those %0afound all over Thebais and Arabia are dry and small, with a %0ashrivelled body : being parched up and scorched by the con- %0astant heat, they are covered with what more nearly resembles %0aa shell ■'^ than a skin. In -35thiopia the date is quite brittle %0aeven, so great is the driness of the climate ; hence the people %0aare able to knead it into a kind of bread, just like so much %0a%0a*' Atbenaeus, B. xiv. c. 22, tells us that these dates were thus called %0afrom Nicolaus of Damascus, a Peripatetic philosopher, who, when visiting %0aEome with Herod the Great, made Augustus a present of the finest fruit %0aof the palm-tree that could be procured. This fruit retained its name of %0a"Nicolaan," down to the middle ages. %0a%0aPliny would imply that they are so called from the Greek a^tX^ta, %0a" a sister," as being of sister quality to the caryotae ; but it is much more %0aprobable, as Fee remarks, that they got this name from being attached in %0apairs to the same pedicle or stalk. %0a%0aPliny certainly seems to imply that they are so called from the Greek %0aTrar'toj, " to tread under foot," and Hardouiu is of that opinion. Fee, %0ahowever, thinks the name is from the Hebrew or Syriac " patach," " to ex- %0apand," or "open," or else from the Hebrew "pathah," the name of the first %0avowel, from some fancied resemblance in the form. %0a%0aFrom the Greek ^vSalog, " vulgar," or " common," it is supposed. The %0aJews probably called them so, as being common, or offered by the Gentiles %0ato their idols and divinities. Pliny evidently considers that in the name %0agiven to them no compliment was intended to the deities of the heathen %0amythology. %0a%0aFrom its extreme driness, and its shrivelled appearance. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 9.] %0a%0a%0a%0aDATES. %0a%0a%0a%0a177 %0a%0a%0a%0aflour.*^ It grows upon a shrub, with branches a cubit in %0alength : it has a broad leaf, and the fruit is round, and larger %0athan an apple. The name of this date is " coix.'"''' It comes %0ato maturity in three years, and there is always fruit to be %0afound upon the shrub, in various stages of maturity. The %0adate of Thebais is at once packed in casks, with all its natu- %0aral heat and freshness ; for without this precaution, it quickly %0abecomes vapid ; it is of a poor, sickly taste, too, if it is not %0aexposed, before it is eaten, to the heat of an oven. %0a%0aThe other kinds of dates appear to be of an ordinary njiture, %0aand are generally known as " tragemata but in some parts of %0aPhoenicia and Cilicia, they are commonly called " balani," a %0aname which has been also borrowed by us. There are nume- %0arous kinds of them, which differ from one another in being %0around or oblong ; as also in colour, for some of them are black, %0aand others red — indeed it is said that they present no fewer %0avarieties of colour than the fig : the white ones, however, are %0athe most esteemed. They differ also in size, according to the %0anumber which it requires to make a cubit in length ; some, %0a, indeed, are no larger than a bean. Those are the best adapted %0a'for keeping which are produced in salt and sandy soils, Judoea, %0aand Cyrena'ica in Africa, for instance : those, however, of Egypt, %0aCyprus, Syria, and Seleucia in Assyria, wiU not keep : hence %0ait is that they are much used for fattening swine and other %0amiimals. It is a sign that the fruit is either spoilt or old, %0awhen the white protuberance disappears, by which it has ad- %0ahered to the cluster. Some of the soldiers of Alexander's army %0awere choked by eating green dates and a similar effect is %0aproduced in the country of the Gedrosi, by the natural quality %0aof the fruit ; while in other places, again, the same results arise %0afrom eating them to excess.

It bears fruit, not upon branches, but upon the trunk %0aitself : the fig is remarkable for its extreme sweetness, and %0ahas no seeds"® in it. This tree is also remarkable for its fruit- %0afulness, which, however, can only be ensured by making inci- %0asions" in the fruit with hooks of iron, for otherwise it will %0anot come to maturity. But when this has been done, it may %0abe gathered within four days, immediately upon which another %0ashoots up in its place. Hence it is that in the year it produces %0aseven abundant crops, and throughout all the summer there is %0aan abundance of milky juice in the fruit. Even if the inci- %0asions are not made, the fruit will shoot afresh four times %0aduring the summer, the new fruit supplanting the old, and %0aforcing it off before it has ripened. The wood, which is of a %0avery peculiar nature, is reckoned among the most useful %0aknown.

The trunk of the tree is %0asimilar to that of the poplar, and the leaves to those of the elm. %0aIt produces four crops in the year, and germinates the same %0anumber of times, but its green fruit will not ripen unless an %0aincision is made in it to let out the milky juice. The sweet- %0aness of the fi-'uit and the appearance of the inside are in all %0arespects similar to those of the fig, and in size it is about as %0alarge as a sorb-apple. %0a%0aCHAP. 16. (8.)

For this reason, committing a manifest error, %0asome persons" have called it the Egyptian fig; it being the %0afact that this tree does not grow in Egypt, but in Syria and' %0aIonia, in the vicinity, too, of Cnidos, and in the island of %0aRhodes.

IN WHAT THEES THE FBUITS %0aGEKMINATE THE ONE BELOW THE OTHEK.' %0a%0aEgypt, too, produces another tree of a peculiar description, %0athe Persian" tree, similar in appearance to the pear-tree, but %0aretaining its leaves during the winter. This tree produces %0awithout intermission, for if the fruit is pulled to-day, fresh %0afruit will make its appearance to-morrow : the time for ripen- %0aing is while the Etesian'* winds prevail. The fruit of this %0atree is more oblong than a pear, but is enclosed in a shell and %0aa rind of a grassy colour, like the almond ; but what is found %0awithin, instead of being a nut as in the almond, is a plum, %0adiffering from the almond'^ in being shorter and quite soft. This %0afruit, although particularly inviting for its luscious sweetness, %0ais productive of no injurious effects. The wood, for its good- %0aness, solidity, and blackness, is in no respect inferior to that %0aof the lotus : people have been in the habit of making statues %0aof it. The wood of the tree which we have mentioned as %0athe " balanus,"^" although very durable, is not so highly es- %0ateemed as this, as it is knotted and twisted in the grcatf^r %0apart : hence it is only employed for the purposes of ship- %0abuilding. %0a%0a'6 See B. xviii. c. 74. %0a%0aFee identifies it with the Egyptian almond, mentioned hy Pliny in %0aB. XV. c. 28; the Myrobalanus chebulus of Wesling, the Balanites %0a^gyptiaca of Delille, and the Xymenia -J]gyptiaca of Linnaeus. Schreber %0aand Sprcngel take it to be the Cordia Sebestana of Linnaeus ; but that is a %0atree peculiar to the Antilles. The fruit is in shape like a date, enclosing a %0alarge stone with five sides, and covered vrith a little viscous flesh, of some- %0awhat bitter, though not disagreeable flavour. It is found in the vicinity %0aof Sennaar, and near the Red Sea. The Arabs call it the " date of the %0aDesert." %0a%0aSee B. xviii. c. 68. 79 gee B. xv. c. 34. %0a%0a>^ Or ben.

It is similar in nature to the palm, as its leaves %0aare similarly used for the purposes of texture : it differs from %0ait, however, in spreading out its arms in large branches. The %0afruit, which is of a size large enough to fill the hand, is of a %0atawny colour, and recommends itself by its juice, which is a %0amixture of sweet and rough. The seed in the inside is large %0aand of remarkable hardness, and turners use it for making %0acurtain rings.*- The kernel is sweet, while fresh ; but when %0a.dried it becomes hard to a most remarkable degree, so much %0aso, that it can only be eaten after being soaked in water for %0aseveral days. The wood is beautifully mottled with circling %0aveiiis,"^ for which reason it is particularly esteemed among the %0aPersians. %0a%0aCHAP. 19. THE EGYPTIAN THORN. %0a%0aNo less esteemed, too, in the same country, is a certain kind %0aof thorn,^ though only the black variety, its wood being im- %0aperishable, in water even, a quality which renders it particu- %0alarly valuable for making the sides of ships : on the other hand, %0athe white kinds will rot very rapidly. It has sharp, prickly %0athorns on the leaves even, and bears its seeds in pods ; they %0aare employed for the same purposes as galls in the preparation %0aof leather. The flower, too, has a pretty effect when made %0ainto garlands, and is extremely useful in medicinal preparations. %0aA gum, also, distils from this tree ; but the principal merit %0athat it possesses is, that when it is cut down, it will grow %0aagain within three years. It grows in the vicinity of Thebes, %0awhere we also find the quercus, the Persian tree, and the olive : %0athe spot that produces it is a piece of woodland, distant three %0a%0aMany have taken this to be the cocoa-nut tree ; but, as Fee remarks, %0athat is a tree of India, and this of Egypt. There is little doubt that it is %0athe doum of the Arabs, the Cucifera Thebaica of Delille. The timber of %0athe trunk is much used in Egypt, and of the leaves carpets, bags, and %0apanniers are made. In fact, the description of it and its fruit is almost %0aidentical with that here given by Pliny. %0a%0aThe seed or stone of the doum is still used in Egypt for making the %0abeads of chaplets : it admits of a very high polish. %0a^ Matcrics crispioris elegantise. %0a%0aSee B. xxiv. c. 67.

Here we find, too, the Egyptian"* plum-tree, not much %0aunlike the thorn last mentioned, with a fruit similar to the %0amedlar, and which ripens in the winter. This tree never loses %0aits leaves. The seed in the fruit is of considerable size, but %0athe flesh of it, by reason of its quality, and the great abund- %0aance in which it grows, affords quite a harvest to the inhabit- %0aants of those parts ; after cleaning it, they subject it to pressure, %0aand then make it up into cakes for keeping. There was for- %0amerly ^ a woodland district in the vicinity of Memphis, -with %0atrees of such enormous size, that three men could not span %0aone with their arms : one of these trees is remarkable, not for %0aits fruit, or any particular use that it is, but for the singular %0aphajnomenon that it presents.

Gum is also found %0aon the elm^- upon Mount Corycus in Cilicia, and upon the %0ajuniper,'^ but it is good for nothing ; indeed, the gum of the %0aelm found there is apt to breed gnats. From the sarcocolla^* %0aalso — such is the name of a certain tree — a gum exudes that is %0aremarkably useful to painters and medical men ; it is similar %0ato incense dust in appearance, and for those purposes the white %0akind is preferable to the red.

This substance contains acetate of potassa, which, by %0athe decomposition of that salt, becomes a carbonate of the same base. %0a%0aThis is not a gum, but a resinous product of a peculiar nature. It is %0aknown to the moderns by tlw name of " olivine." %0a%0a" The sap of the cini leaves a saline deposit on the bark, principally %0aformed of carbonate of potassa. Fee is at a loss to know whether Pliny %0ahere alludes to this or to the manna which is incidentally formed by certain %0ainsects on some trees and reeds. But, as be justly says, would Pliny say %0aof the latter that it is " ad nihil utile"—" good for nothing".? %0a%0aA resinous product, no doubt.

The description here given is otherwise very correct. %0a%0a* Among the ancients the term papyrus was used as a general appellation %0afor all the different plants of the genus Cyperus, which was used for making %0amats, boats, baskets, and numerous other articles : but one species only %0awas employed for making paper, the Cyperus papyrus, or Byblos. l ee %0astates that the papyrus is no longer to be found in the Delta, where it for- %0amerly abounded.

That of the first quality is %0ataken from the centre of the plant, and so in regular succession, %0aaccording to the order of division. " llieratica'"" was the name %0athat was ancicntlj'' given to it, from the circumstance that it %0awas entirely reserved for the religious books. In later times, %0athrough a spirit of adulation, it received the name of " Au- %0agusta," just as that of second quality was called " Liviana," %0afrom his wife, Livia ; the consequence of which was, that the %0aname "hieratica" came to designate that of only third-rate %0aquality. The paper of the next quality was called " amphi- %0atheatrica," from the locality" of its manufacture. The skilful %0amanufactory that was established by Pannius'''^ at Rome, was in %0athe habit of receiving this last kind, and there, by a very %0acareful process of insertion, it was rendered much finer; so %0amuch so, that from being a common sort, he made it a paper of %0afirst-rate quality, and gave his own'^ name to it: while that %0awhich was not subjected to this additional process retained %0aits original name of amphitheatrica." Next to this is the %0aSaitic paper, so called from the city of that name, " where %0ait is manufactured in very large quantities, though of cuttings %0aof inferior quality. The Tajniotic paper, so called from a %0aplace in the vicinity,^^ is manufactured from the materials that %0alie nearer to the outside skin ; it is sold, not according to its %0aquality, but by weight only.

The Romans were in the habit of purchasing it %0alargely in the latter state, and then washing off the writing, and using it %0aas paper of the finest quality. Hence it received the name of "Augustus," %0aas representing in Latin its Greek name " hieraticus," or " sacred." lu %0alength of time it became the common impression, as here mentioned, that %0athis name was given to it in honour of Augustus Caesar. %0a%0a11 Near the amphitheatre, probably, of Alexandria. %0a%0aHe alludes to Q.

This table %0abeing first inclined,-" the leaves of papyrus are laid upon it %0alengthwise, as long, indeed, as the papyrus will admit of, the %0ajagged edges being cut off at cither end ; after which a cross %0alayer is placed over it, the same way, in fact, that hurdles are %0amade. When this is done, the leaves are pressed close together, %0aand then dried in the sun ; after which they are united to one %0aanother, the best sheets being always taken first, and the infe- %0arior ones added afterwards. There are never more than %0atwenty of these sheets to a roU.^' %0a%0aCHAP. 24. THE MODE OF TESTING THE GOODNESS OF PAPEK. %0a%0aThere is a great difference in the breadth of the various %0akinds of paper. That of best quality is thirteen fingers wide, %0awhile the hicratica is two fingers less. The Fanniana is ten %0afingers wide, and that knowTi as " amphitheatrica," one less. %0aThe Saitic is of still smaller breadth, indeed it is not so %0awide as the mallet with which the paper is beaten ; and the %0aemporetica is particularly narrow, being not more than six %0afingers in breadth. %0a%0aIn addition to the above particulars, paper is esteemed %0aaccording to its fineness, its stoutness, its whiteness, and its %0asmoothness. Claudius CsEsar efi"ected a change in that which %0a%0a" Shop-paper," or " paper of commerce." %0a%0aOtherwise, probably, the rope would not long hold together. %0a" Fee remarks, that tliis is by no means the fact.

To obviate these inconveniences, a groundwork of %0apaper was made with leaves of the second quality, over which %0awas laid a Avoof, as it were, formed of leaves of the first. He %0aincreased the width also of paper ; the width [of the common %0asort] being made a foot, and that of the size known as "macro- %0acoUum,"'*^ a cubit ; though one inconvenience was soon detected %0ain it, for, upon a single leaf** being torn in the press, more %0apages were apt to be spoilt than before.'"* In consequence of %0athe advantages above-mentioned, the Claudian has come to be %0apreferred to all other kinds of paper, though the Augustan is %0astill used for the purposes of epistolary correspondence. The %0aLivian, which had nothing in common with that of first quality, %0abut was entirely of a secondary rank, still holds its former %0aplace. %0a%0aCHAP. 25. THE PECULIAR DEFECTS IN PAPER. %0a%0aThe roughness and inequalities in paper are smoothed down %0awith a tooth*® or shell ; but the writing in such places is very %0aapt to fade. When it is thus polished the paper does not take %0athe ink so readily, but is of a more lustrous and shining surface. %0aThe water of the Nile that has been originally employed in %0aits manufacture, being sometimes used without due precaution, %0awill unfit the paper for taking writing : this fault, however, %0amay be detected by a blow with the mallet, or even by %0athe smell,-' when the carelessness has been extreme.

It is not unlikely that his meaning is that the %0abreadth being doubled, the tearing of one leaf or half breadth entailed of %0anecessity the spoiling of another, making the corresponding half breadth. %0a%0a26 He perhaps means a portion of an elephant's tusk. %0a2^ Meaning a damp, musty smell. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 27.] %0a%0a%0a%0aTHE BOOKS OF NUMA. %0a%0a%0a%0a191 %0a%0a%0a%0aspots, too, may be detected by the eye ; but the streaks that %0arun down the middle of the leaves where they have been %0apasted together, though they render the paper spongy and of %0aa soaking nature, can hardly ever be detected before the ink %0aruns, while the pen is forming the letters ; so many are the %0aopenings for fraud to bo put in practice. The consequence is, %0athat another labour has been added to the due preparation %0aof paper. %0a%0aCHAP. 26. THE PASTE USED IN THE PREPARATION OF PAPER. %0a%0aThe common paper paste is made of the finest flour of wheat %0amixed with boiling water, and some sniall drops of vinegar %0asprinkled in it : for the ordinary workman's paste, or gum, %0aif employed for this purpose, will render the paper brittle. %0aThose, however, who take the greatest pains, boil the crumb %0aof leavened bread, and then strain off" the water : by the %0aadoption of this method the paper has the fewest seams caused %0aby the paste that lies between, and is softer than the nap of %0alinen even. All kinds of paste that are used for this purpose, %0aought not to be older or newer than one day. The paper is %0athen thinned out with a mallet, after which a new layer of %0apaste is placed upon it ; then the creases which have formed %0aare again pressed out, and it then undergoes the same process %0awith the mallet as before. It is thus that we have memorials %0apreserved in the ancient hand\\Titing of Tiberius and Caius %0aGracchus, which I have seen in the possession of Pomponius %0aSecundus,^® the poet, a very illustrious citizen, almost two %0ahundred years since those characters were penned. As for the %0ahandwriting of Cicero, Augustus, and Virgil, we frequently %0asee them at the present dny. %0a%0aCHAP. 27. (13.) — THE BOOKS OF NUMA. %0a%0aThere are some facts of considerable importance which make %0aagainst the opinion expressed by M. Varro, relative to the %0ainvention of paper. Cassius Hemina, a writer of very great %0aantiquity, has stated in the Fourth Book of his Annals, that %0aCneius Terentius, the scribe, while engaged in digging on his %0a%0aSee B. vii. c. 18, and B. xiv. c. 6.

This took place in tli( %0aconsulship of Publius Cornelius Cethegus, the son of Lucius, %0aand of M. Ecebius Taraphilus, the son of Quintus, the interval %0abetween whose consulship and the reign of Numa Avas five %0ahundred and thirty-five years. These books Avere made of %0apaper, and, a thing that is more remarkable still, is the fact %0athat they lasted so many years buried in the ground. In %0aorder, therefore, to establish a fact of such singular import- %0aance, I shall here quote the woi'ds of Hemina himself — " !Some %0apersons expressed wender how these books could have possibly %0alasted so long a time — this was the explanation that Teren- %0atius gave : ' In nearly the middle of the coffer there lay a square • %0astone, bound on every side with cords enveloped in wax %0aupon this stone tlie books had been placed, and it was through %0athis precaution, he thought, that they had not rotted. The %0abooks, too, were carefully covered with citrus leaves,^' and it %0awas through this, in his belief, that they had been protected %0afrom the attacks of worms.' In these books were written %0acertain doctrines relative to the Pythagorean philosophy ; they %0awere burnt by Q. Petilius, the praetor, because they treated %0aof philosophical subjects. %0a%0aPiso, who had formerly been censor, relates the same facts %0ain the Pirst Book of his Commentaries, but he states in addition, %0aT.hat there were seven books on Pontifical Rights, and seven on %0athe Pythagorean philosophy.^^ Tuditanus, in his Fourteenth %0aBook, says that they contained the decrees of Jfuma : Varro, in %0athe Seventh Book of his " Antiquities of Mankind," ^* states that %0athey were twelve in number ; and Antias, in his Second Book, %0asays that there were twelve written in Latin, on pontifical %0a%0aThis story, no doubt, deserves to be rejected as totally fabulous, even %0athough we have Hemina's word for it. %0a3" See B. xvi. c. 70. %0a%0a'1 B. xii. c. 7, and B. xiii. c. 31.

In addition to these facts, %0aMucianus, who was three times consul, has stated that he had %0arecently read, while governor of Lycia, a letter written upon %0apaper, and preserved in a certain temple there, which had %0abeen written from Troy, by Sarpedon ; a thing that surprises %0ame the more, if it really was the fact that even in the time %0aof Homer the country that we call Egypt was not in exist- %0a'ence.^' And Avhy too, if paper was tlien in use, was it the %0acustom, as it is very well known it was, to write upon leaden %0atablets and linen cloths ? Why, too, has Homer'^'* stated that %0ain Lycia tablets^"^ were given to Bellerophon to carry, and not %0aa paper letter ? %0a%0aPapyrus, for making paper, is apt to fail occasionally ; sucli %0aa thing happened in the time of the Emperor Tiberius, when %0athere was so great a scarcity*" of paper that members of the %0asenate were appointed to regulate the distribution of it : had %0anot this been done, all the ordinary relations of life would %0ahave been completely disarranged. %0a%0aCHAP. 28.

Two %0atables were also sold hy auction Avhich Imd belonged to King %0a■Tuba ; the price fetched by one was one million two hundred %0athousand sesterces, and that of the other something less. %0aThere has been lately destroyed by fire, a table which came %0adown from the family of the Cethegi, and which had been sold %0afor the sum of one million four hundred thousand sesterces, %0athe price of a considerable domain, if any one, indeed, could be %0afound who would give so large a sum for an estate. %0a%0a■•^ In c. 9 of the present Book.

The largest %0atable that is made of a single piece of wood, is the one that %0atakes its name*- from Nomius, a freedmnn of Tiberius Caesar. %0aThe diameter of it is four feet, short by three quarters of an %0ainch, and it is half a foot in thickness, less the same fraction. %0aAViiile speaking uptm tliis subject, I ought not to omit to men- %0ation that the Emperor Tiberius had a table that exceeded four %0afeet iu diameter by two inches and a (juarter, and Avas an incli %0aand a half in tliickness : this, however, was only covered with %0aa veneer of citrus-wood, while that which belonged to his %0afrecdman Nomius was so costly, the whole material of which %0ait was composed being knotted wood. %0a%0aThese knots are proper!}' a disease or excrescence of the %0aroot, and those used for this purpose are more particularly %0aesteemed wliich have lain entirel}' concealed under ground; %0athey are much more rare than those that grow above ground, %0aand that are to be found on the branches also. Thus, to speak %0acorrectl)', that which we buy at so vast a price is in reality a %0adefect in the tree : of the size and root of it a notion may be %0aeasily formed from the circular sections of its trunk. The %0atree resembles the wild female cypress^^ in its foliage, smell, %0aand the appearance of the trunk. A spot called Mount Anco- %0ararius, in Nearer Mauretania, used Ibrnierly to furnish the %0amost esteemed citrus-wood, but at the present day the su2)ply %0ais quite exhausted. %0a%0aCflAr. 30. — T1II5 POINTS TH.^VT ARE DESIR.ABLE OR OTHEKWISK IN %0aTHESE TABLES. %0a%0aThe principal merit of those tables is to have veins** arranged %0a%0a*' This is considered notliing remarkable at the jireseiit day, such is the %0asldll displayed by our cabinet-iuakcrs. %0a%0a*- Called '■ Isomiaiia." *^ Tuber. %0a%0a*' The European cyprus, tlio Cupressu.s serapsrvireus of Linn cus. %0a" These veins were nothing in rcalitv but the lines of the layers or %0a%0ao 2 %0a%0a%0a%0a196 %0a%0a%0a%0apliny's katueal histout. %0a%0a%0a%0a[Book XII!. %0a%0a%0a%0ain waving lines, or else forming spirals like so many little %0awhirlpools.

There are' %0asome tables also with wavy, undulating marks, and which aiv %0amore particularly esteemed if these resemble the eyes on a %0apeacock's tail. Next in esteem to these last, as well as those %0apreviously mentioned, is the veined wood,** covered, as it were, %0awith dense masses of grain, for Avhich reason these tabk s have %0areceived the name of '' apiatao." ^* But the colour of the wood %0ais the quality that is held in the highest esteem of all : that %0aof wine mixed with honey^" being the most prized, the veinsbeiiig %0apeculiai-ly refulgent. Next to the colour, it is the size that is %0aprized ; at the present day whole trunks are greatly admired, %0aand sometimes several are united in a single table. %0a%0aThe peculiar defects in these kinds of tables are woodiness," %0asuch being the name given to the table when the wood is dull, %0acommon-looking, indistinct, or else has mere simple marks %0aupon it, resembling the leaves of the plane-tree ; also, when %0ait resembles the veins of the holm-oak or the colour of that %0atree; and, a fault to which it is peculiarly liable Irom the %0aetfect of heat or wind, when it has flaws in it or hair-like lines %0aresembling flaws ; when it has a black mark, too, running %0athrough it resembling a murena in appearance, various streaks %0athat look like crow scratches, or knots like poppy heads, with a %0acolour all over nearly approaching to black, or blotches of a %0asickly hue.

Theo- %0ajjhrastus, an author who wrote in the age succeeding that of %0aAlexander the Great, and about the year of the City of Rome %0a440, has awarded a very high rank to this tree, stating that it %0ais related that the raftering of the ancient temples used to be %0amade of this wood, aud that the timber, when employed iu %0aroofs, will last for ever, so to say, being proof against all di'- %0acay, — quite incorruptible, in fact.

THE LOTUS. %0a%0aAfrica, too, at least that part of it which looks towards %0aour shores, produces a remarkable tree, the lotus, ''^ by some %0aknown as the "celtis," which has also been naturalized in Italy,"* %0athough it has been somewhat modified by the change of soil. %0aThe finest quality of lotus is that found in the vicinity of the %0aSyrtes and among the Xasamones. It is the same size as tlic %0apear-tree, although Cornelius Nepos states to the eff'ect that it %0ais but short. The leaves have numerous incisions, just as witli %0athose of the holm-oak. There are many varieties of the lotus, %0awhich are characterized more particularly by the diffenmce in %0atheir respective fruits. The fruit is of about the size of a %0abean, and its colour is that of saffron, though before it is ripe %0ait is continually changing its tints, like the grape. It has %0abranches thickly set with leaves, like the myrtle, and not, %0aas with us in Italy, like tlie cherry. In the country to %0awhich this tree is indigenous, the fruit of it is so remarkably %0asweet and luscious, that it has even given its name to a whole %0aterritory, and to a nation^' who, by their singular hospitality, %0ahave even seduced strangers who have come among them, to %0alose all remembrance of their native country. It is said also, %0athat those who eat this fruit are subject to no maladies of llie %0astomach. The fruit which has no stone in the inside is the %0abest : this stone in the other kind seems to be of an osseous %0anature.

In- %0adeed, we read that armies have been fed upon this food whan %0amarching to and fro through the territory of Africa. The %0awood is of a black colour, and is held in high esteem for making %0aflutes ; from the root also they manufacture handles for knives, %0aand various other small articles. %0a%0aSuch is the nature of the tree that is so called in Africa ; the %0asame name being also given to a certain " herb, and to a stalk''^ %0athat grows in Egypt belonging to the marsh plants. This last %0aplant springs up when the waters of tlie Nile liave retired after %0aits overflow : its stalk is similar to that of the bean, and its %0aleaves are numerous and grow in tliick clusters, but are shorter %0aand more slender than those of the bean. The fruit grows on %0athe head of the plant, and is similar in appearance to a pop])y %0ain its indentations" and all its other characteristics ; within %0atliere are small grains, similar to those of millet.'* The, in- %0ahabitants lay these heads in large heaps, and there let tlieui %0arot, after which they separate the grain from the residue by %0awashing, and then dry it ; when this is done they pound it, %0aand then use it as flour for making a kind of bread. What is %0astated in addition to these particulars, is a very singular'^ fact ; %0ait is said that when the sun sets, these poppy-heads shut and %0acover themselves in the leaves, and at sun-rise they open %0aagain ; an alternation which continues until the fruit is per- %0afectly ripe, and the flower, which is white, falls off. %0a%0a(18.)

This fruit contains a nut, the kernel of which %0ais eaten by itself, and is of a very agreeable flavour. The %0ataste of it is improved by wine, and, in fact, the juices are %0athought to be an improvement to wine. The interior of %0aAfrica, as far as the Gai'amantes and the deserts, is covered %0awith palms, remarkable for their extraordinary size and the %0alusciousness of their fruit.

THE ANDRACnLE.* %0a%0aNearly all the Greek writers interpret the name of the troe. %0acalled " andrachle," as meaning the same as "purshiin:"' %0awhereas purslain is, in reality, a herb, and, with the diffi reiioe %0aof a single letter, is called " andrachne." The andrachle is u %0awild tree, which never grows in the plain country, and is simi- %0alar to the arbiite tree in appearance, only that its leaves are %0asmaller, and never fall off. The bark, too, is not rough, but %0amight be taken to be frozen all over, so truly wretched is its %0aappearance. %0a%0aCHAP. 41. — THE COCCYGIA ; THE APHAKCE. %0a%0aSimilar, too, in leaf to the preceding tree, is the coccygin,' %0athough not so large ; it has this peculiarity, that it loses its %0afruit while still in the downy ^ state — they then call it %0a" pappus " — a thing that happens to no other tree. The %0aapharce is another tree that is similar to the andrachle, and %0alike it, bears twice in the year : just as the grnpe is beginning %0ato flower the first fruit is ripening, while the second fruit %0aripens at the commencement of winter; of what natuTe this %0afruit is we do not find stated. %0a%0aCHAP. 42. THE FERULA. %0a%0a"We ought to place the ferula" also in the number of the %0aexotics, and as making one of the trees. For, in fact, we dis- %0atinguish the trees into several different kinds : it is the nature %0aof some to have wood entirely in place of bark, or, in other %0a%0a« In the former editions, "arlrachne" — the Arbutus intcj^ri folia, F^e %0aSiiys, and not the Arhutus andrachne of Linnicus, as Sprengel thinks. %0a%0a' " Poroillaca " The Portulaca oleracea of Linnaeus. %0a%0a* The Rhus cotinus of Linnseiis, a sort of sumach. %0a%0a^ This is not the fact ; the seeds when ripe are merely lost to view in %0athe large tufts of down wliich grow on the stems. %0a%0a^" Generally supposed to be the same as the alatemus, mentioned in %0aB. xvi. 0. 45.

The ferula %0agrows in hot countries and in places beyond sea, the stalk %0abeing divided into knotted joints. There are two kijids of it ; %0atliat which grows upwards to a great height the Greeks call %0aby the name of " narthex," while the other, which never %0arises far from the ground, is known as the " nartliecya." %0aFrom the joints very large leaves shoot forth, the largest lying %0anearest to the ground : in other respects it has the same na- %0ature as the anise, which it resembles also in its fruit. The %0awood of no shrub is lighter than this ; hence it is very easily %0acarried, and the stalks of it make good walking-sticks" for %0athe aged. %0a%0aCKAP. 43. THE THAPSIA. %0a%0aThe seed of the ferula has been by some persons called %0a"thapsia;"^* deceived, no doubt, by what is really the fact, %0athat the thapsia is a ferula, but of a peculiar kind, with leaves %0alike those of fennel, and a hollow stalk not exceeding a walk- %0aing-stick in length ; the seed is like that of the ferula, and %0athe root of the plant is white. When an incision is made in %0athe thnpsia, a milkj' juice oozes from it, and, when pounded, %0ait produces a kind of juice ; the bark even is never thrown'" %0aaway. All these parts of the shrub are poisonous, and, in- %0adeed, it is productive of injurious effects to those engaged in %0adigging it up ; for if the slightest wind should happen to be %0ablowing towards them from the shrub, the body begins to %0aswell, and erysipelas attacks the face : it is for this reason that, %0abefore beginning work, they anoint the face all over with a %0asolution of wax. Still, however, the medical men say that, %0ami.\ed with other ingredients, it is of considerable use in the %0a%0aThe Ferula glanca of LiniiKtis. %0a%0aThe Ferula iiodiflora of Linnaeus. %0a' " It is still used for that purpose in the south of Europe. The Roman %0aschoolmasters, as we learn from Juvenal, Martial, and others, employed it %0afor the chastisement of their scholars. Pliny is in error in reckoning it %0aamong the trees, it really having no pretensions to bo considered suck. %0aIt is said to liave received its name from " ferio," to "beat." %0a%0aSprengel tliinks that this is the Thapsia aselei)iuni of the moderns ; %0abut Fee takes it to he the Thapsia villosa of Linuieus. %0a" It was valued, Dioscorides sayy, for its cathai tic properties. %0a%0a%0a%0a206 %0a%0a%0a%0aplin't's t?atl'i:al history. %0a%0a%0a%0a[Book Xlll. %0a%0a%0a%0atreatment of some diseases.

These plants, however, act thoii* part in %0aserving as a pretext for the introduction of noxious agents ; %0aand so great is the effrontery now displayed, that people would %0aabsolutely persuade one that poisons are a requisite adjunct to %0athe practice of the medical art. %0a%0aThe thapsia of Africa'^ is the most powerful of all. Some %0apersons make an incision in the stalk at harvest-time, andboro %0aholes in the root, too, to let the juice flow; after it has be- %0acome quite diy, they take it away. Others, again, pound the %0aleaves, stalk, and root in a mortar, and after drying the juice %0ain the sun, divide it into lozenges. N(a-o Ca)sar, at the be- %0aginning of his reign, confeiTcd considerable celebrity on this %0aplant. In his nocturnal skirmishes'^ it so happened that lie %0areceived several contusions on the face, \i\)on which he %0aanointed it with a mixture composed of thapsia, frankincense, %0aand wax, and so contrived the next day effectually to give the %0alie to all rumours, by apjjeuring with a whole skin.^" It is a %0awell-known fact, that fiie'-' is ke])t alight remarkably well in %0athe hollow slalk of the ferula, and that for this purpose those %0aof Egypt are the best. %0a%0aCHAP. 44.

This slirub, %0ahowever, will only grow upon a kind of thorn, which is known %0aas the royal tliorn.'^" It is a wonderful fact, but it germinates %0atlie very same day that it has been planted.

THE CYTISUS. %0a%0aThe cytisus^" is also a shrub, which, as a food for sheep, has %0abeen extolled with wonderful encomiums by Aristomachus the %0aAthenian, and, in a dry state, for swiue as well : the same %0aauthor, too, pledges his word that a jugerura of very mid- %0adling land, planted with the cytisus, Avill produce an income %0aof two thousand sesterces per annum. It is quite as useful as %0athe er\aim,^' but is apt to satiate more speedily : very little of %0ait is necessary to fatten cattle ; to such a degree, indeed, that %0abeasts of burden, when fed upon it, \vill very soon take a dis- %0alike to barley. There is no fodder known, in fact, that is %0al^roductive of a greater abundance of milk, and of better qua- %0ality; in the medical treatment of cattle in particular, this %0ashrub is found a most excellent specific for every kind of ma- %0alady. Even more than this, the same author recommends it, %0awhen first dried and then boiled in water, to be given to nurs- %0aing women, mixtMl with wine, in cases where the milk has %0afailed them : and he says that, if this is done, the infant will %0abe all the stronger and taller for it. In a green state, or, if %0adried, steeped in water, he recommends it for fowls. Both %0aDemocritus and Aristomachus promise us also that bees will %0anever fail us so long as they can obtain the cytisus for food. %0aThere is no crop that we know of, of a similar nature, that %0acosts a smaller price. It is sown at the same time as barley, %0aor, at all events, in the spring, in seed like the leek, or else %0aplanted in the autumn, and before the winter solstice, in the stalk. %0aWhen sown in grain, it ought to be steeped in water, and if %0a%0a2» The Makron Tcichos.

It is trans- %0aplanted at the equinoxes, while the shrub is yet tender, and in %0athree years it will arrive at maturity. It is cut at the vernal %0aequinox, when the flower is just going off; a child or an old %0awoman is able to do this, and their labour may be had at a %0atrifling rate. It is of a white appearance, and if one would %0awish to express briefly what it looks like, it is a trifoliated %0aehrub,^- with small, narrow leaves. It is always given' to %0aanimals at intervals of a couple of days, and in winter, when it is %0adry, before being given to them, it is first moistened with water. %0aTen pounds of cytisus will suffice for a horse, and for smaller %0aanimals in proportion : if I may here mention it by the way, %0ait is found veiy profitable to sow garlic and onions between %0athe rows of cytisus. %0a%0aThis shrub has been found in the Isle of Cythnus, from %0awhence it has been transplanted to all the Cyclades, and more %0arecently to the cities of Greece, a fact which has greatly in- %0acreased the supply of cheese : considering which, I am much %0asurprised that it is so rarely used in Italy. This shrub is proof, %0atoo, against all injuries from heat, from cold, from hail, and %0afrom snow : and, as Hyginus adds, against the depredations of %0athe enemy even, the wood^^ produced being of no value what- %0aever. %0a%0aCHAP. 48.

A third kind," %0aagain, is similar in appearance to grass; the root of it is %0aknotted, and so is the stalk, which resembles that of a reed. %0a%0aCHAP. 49. THE SEA BRYON. %0a%0aThere is another kind of marine shrub, known by the name %0aof " biyon;"^* it has the leaf of the lettuce, only that it is %0aof a more wrinkled appearance; it grows nearer land, too, than %0athe last. Far out at sea we find a fir-tree" and an oak/° %0aeach a cubit in height ; shells are found adhering to their %0abranches. It is said that this sea-oak is used for dyeing wool, %0aand that some of them even bear acorns " in the sea, a fact which %0ahas been ascertained by shipwrecked persons and divers. There %0aare other marine trees also of remarkable size, found in the %0avicinity of Sicyon ; the sea- vine,** indeed, grows everywhere. %0aThe sea-fig is destitute of leaves, and the bark is red.

If, on the other hand, it is really a fucus, he thinks that the %0aFucus uvariuB may be meant, the vesicles of which resemble a grape in %0ashape. %0a%0aHe speaks of a madrepore, Fee thinks, the identity of which it is %0a%0a%0a%0aCbap. 51.] %0a%0a%0a%0aPLANTS OF THE INDIAN SEA. %0a%0a%0a%0a211 %0a%0a%0a%0ais a palm-tree ^ also in the number of the sea-shrubs. Beyond %0athe columns of Hercules there is a sea-shrub that grows with %0athe leaf of the leek, and others with those of the caiTot,*' and %0aof thyme. Both of these last, when thrown up by the tide, %0aare transformed into pumice. %0a%0aCHAP. 50. — PLANTS OF THE EED SEA. %0a%0aIn the East, it is a very remarkable thing, that immediately %0aafter leaving Coptos, as we pass through the deserts, we find %0anothing whatever growing, with the exception of the thorn that %0ais known as the " thirsty"*^ thorn ; and this but very rarely. %0aIn the Bed Sea, however, there are whole forests found grow- %0aing, among which more particularly there are plants that bear %0athe laurel-berry and the olive when it rains also certain %0afungi make their appearance, which, as soon as they are touched %0aby the rays of the sun, are turned into pumice. The size of the %0ashrubs is three cubits in height ; and they are all filled with %0asea-dogs,*® to such a degree, that it is hardly safe to look at %0athem from the ship, for they will fi'equently seize hold of the %0avery oars. %0a%0aCHAP. 51. PLANTS OF THE INDIAN SEA. %0a%0aThe officers " of Alexander who navigated the Indian seas, %0ahave left an account of a marine tree, the foliage of which is %0agreen while in the water ; but the moment it is taken out, it %0a%0adifficult to determine. Professor Pallas speaks of an Alcyonidium ficus, %0awhich lives in the Mediterranean and in the ocean, and which resembles a %0atig, and has no leaves, but its exterior is not red. %0a%0a^ Fee queries whether this may not be the tiorgonia palma of Linnaeus, %0awhich has received its name from its resemblance to a small palm-tree. %0a%0a*' These three, Fee thinks, are madrepores or zoophytes, which it would %0abe vain to attempt to identify. %0a%0a' 6- 'I'liat they dry up to the consistency of pumice. %0a%0a" " Siticns."

The smaller ones arc entirely %0acovered by the waves, while the summits of those of larger %0asize protrude from the water, and ships ore made fast to them ; %0awhen the tide falls the vessels are similarlj' moored to the roots. %0aWe find the same persons making mention of certain other %0atrees which they saw out at sea, which always retained their %0aleaves, and bore a fruit very similar to the lupine. %0a%0aCHAP. 52.

(1.) — UNGUENTS — AT WHAT PEEIOD THET WEEE FIEST %0a%3c INTROBUCED. %0a%3c %0a%3c Thus far we have been speaking of the trees which are %0a%3c valuable for the odours they produce, and each of wliich is a %0a%3c subject for our wonder in itself. Luxury, ho^'ever, has %0a%3c thought fit to mingle all of these, and to make a single odour %0a%3c of the whole ; hence it is that unguents have been invented.^ %0a%3c "Who was the first to make unguents is a fact not recorded. %0a%3c In the times of the Trojan war^ they did not exist, nor did %0a%3c they use incense when sacrificing to the gods ; indeed, people %0a%3c knew of no other smell, or rather stench,^ I may saj', than that %0a%3c of the cedar and the citrus,* shrubs of their own growth, as it %0a%3c arose in volumes of smoke from the sacrifices ; still, however, %0a%3c even then, the extract of roses was known, for we find it men- %0a%3c tioned as conferring additional value on olive-oil. %0a%3c %0a%3c Wc ought, by good rights, to ascribe the first use of un- %0a%3c guents to the Persians, for tlioy quite soak themselves in it, %0a%3c and so, bj'' an adventitious recou^mcndation, counteract the %0a%3c bad odours which are produced by dirt. The first instance of %0a%3c the use of unguents that I have been able to meet with is that of %0a%3c the chest* of perfumes which fell into the hands of Alexander, %0a%3c Avith the rest of the property of King Darius, at the taking of his %0a%3c %0a%3c ' Fee remarks, that most of the unguents and perfumes of wliich Pliny %0a%3c here speaks Avould find but little favour at the present day. %0a%3c %0a%3c - This does not appear to be exactly the case, for in the twenty-third %0a%3c Book of tlic Iliad, 1. 186, we P.ud "rose-scented" oil mentioned, indeed, %0a%3c Pliny himself alludes to it a little further on. %0a%3c %0a%3c •■' "Nidorem."

Those perfumes which are not the produce of %0a%3c shrubs'' will only be mentioned for the present by name : the %0a%3c nature of them will, however, be stated in their appropriate %0a%3c places. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 2. — THE VAEIOirs KINDS OF UNGUENTS — TWELVE PEIN- %0a%3c CIPAL COMPOSITIONS, %0a%3c %0a%3c The names of unguents are due, some of them, to the ori- %0a%3c ginal place of their composition, others, again, to the extracts %0a%3c which form their bases, others to the trees from which they %0a%3c are derived, and others to the peculiar circumstance under %0a%3c which they were first made : and it is as well, first of all, to %0a%3c know that in this respect the fashion has often changed, and %0a%3c that the high repute of peculiar kinds has been but transitory. %0a%3c In ancient times, the perfumes the most esteemed of all were %0a%3c those of the island of Delos,^ and at a later period those of %0a%3c Mendes.^ This degree of esteem is founded, not only on the %0a%3c mode of mixing them and the relative proportions, but accord- %0a%3c ing to the degree of favour or disfavour in which the various %0a%3c places which produce the ingredients are held, and the compa- %0a%3c rative excellence or degeneracy of the ingi-edients themselves. %0a%3c The perfume of iris," from Corinth, was long held in the %0a%3c highest esteem, till that of Cyzicus came into fashion. It was %0a%3c the same, too, with the perfume of roses," from Phaselis,^^ the %0a%3c %0a%3c « The use of perfumes more probably originated in India, than among %0a%3c the Pei'sians. %0a%3c %0a%3c But of seeds or plants %0a%3c %0a%3c * The perfumes of JJelos tbemselves had nothing in particular to re- %0a%3c commend them ; but as it was tlie centre of the worship of Apollo, it is not %0a%3c improbable that exquisite perfumes formed a large proportion of the offer- %0a%3c ings brought thither from all parts of the world. %0a%3c %0a%3c 8 In Egypt.

All %0a%3c these perfumes are rendered still more pungent by the addi- %0a%3c tion of costus and amomum, which have a particularly power- %0a%3c ful effect on the olfactory organs ; while myrrh gives them %0a%3c greater consistency and additional sweetness, and saffron makes %0a%3c them better adapted for medicinal purposes. They are most %0a%3c pungent, however, w^hen mixed with amomum alone, which %0a%3c will often produce head-ache even. There are some persons who %0a%3c content themselves with sprinkling the more precious ingre- %0a%3c dients upon the others after boiling them down, for the pur- %0a%3c pose of economy ; but the strength of the unguent is not so %0a%3c great as when the ingredients have been boiled together. %0a%3c Myrrh used by itself, and without the mixture of oil, forms %0a%3c an imguent, but it is stacte"* only that must be used, for other- %0a%3c wise it will be productive of too great bitterness. Unguent of %0a%3c cy3)rus turns other unguents green, while lily unguent makes %0a%3c them more unctuous : the unguent of Mendes turns them %0a%3c black, rose unguent makes them white, and that of myrrh %0a%3c of a pallid hue. %0a%3c %0a%3c Such are the particulars of the ancient inventions, and the %0a%3c various falsifications of the shops in later times ; we will now %0a%3c pass on to make mention of what is the very height of refine- %0a%3c ment in these articles of luxury, indeed, I may say, the beau %0a%3c ideal" of them all. %0a%3c Nardinum. %0a%3c %0a%3c 88 Or leaf unguent, so called from being made of leaves of nard.

Unguents, too, improve with age ; %0a%3c but the sun is apt to spoil them, for which reason they are %0a%3c usually stowed away in a shady place in vessels of lead. %0a%3c When their goodness is being tested, they are placed on the %0a%3c back of the hand, lest the heat of the palm, which is more %0a%3c fleshy, should have a bad effect upon them. %0a%3c %0a%3c " See B. xii. c. 46.

(3.) THE EXCESSES TO WHICH LUXTJHT HAS ETIII IN %0a%3c %0a%3c UNGUENTS. %0a%3c %0a%3c These perfumes form the objects of a luxury which may be %0a%3c looked upon as being the most superfluous of any, for pearls %0a%3c and jewels, after all, do pass to a man's representative, and %0a%3c garments have some durability; but unguents lose their %0a%3c odour in an instant, and die away the very hour they are %0a%3c used. The very highest recommendation of them is, that %0a%3c when a female passes by, the odour which proceeds from her %0a%3c may possibly attract the attention of those even who till then %0a%3c are intent upon something else. In price they exceed so large %0a%3c a sum even as four hundred denarii per pound : so vast is the %0a%3c amount that is paid for a luxury made not for our own enjoy- %0a%3c ment, but for that of others ; for the person who carries the %0a%3c perfume about him is not the one, after all, that smells it. %0a%3c %0a%3c And yet, even here, there are some points of difference that %0a%3c deserve to be remarked. We read in the works of Cicero, " %0a%3c that those unguents which smell of the earth are preferable to %0a%3c those which smell of saffron ; being a proof, that even in a %0a%3c matter which most strikingly bespeaks our state of extreme %0a%3c corruptness, it is thought as well to temper the vice by a little %0a%3c show of austerity.^* There are some persons too who look more %0a%3c particularly for consistency®' in their unguents, to which they %0a%3c accordingly give the name of "spissum f^' thus showing that %0a%3c they love not only to be sprinkled, but even to be plastered over, %0a%3c with unguents. We have known the very soles ^ even of the %0a%3c feet to be sprinkled with perfumes ; a refinement which was %0a%3c taught, it is said, by M. Otho ^' to the Emperor Nero. "Eow, %0a%3c %0a%3c ^ " Hercs."

B. iii. c. 69. Both Cicero and Pliny pro- %0a%3c fess to find a smell that arises from the earth itself, through the agency of %0a%3c the sun. But, as Fee remarks, pure earth is perfectly inodorous. He sug- %0a%3c gests, however, that this odour attributed by the ancients to the earth, may %0a%3c in reality have proceeded from the fibrous roots of thyme and other plants. %0a%3c If such IS not the real solution, it seems impossible to suggest any other. %0a%3c By giving preference to the more simple odours. %0a%3c " Crassitudo."

It loves the vicinity of flowing %0a%3c water ; and as it is its nature to imbibe the whole of the year, %0a%3c there are some who are of opinion that in a year of drought %0a%3c it will receive injury from being manured even, if the manure %0a%3c is not first mixed with running water : this, at least, is the idea %0a%3c entertained by some of the Assyrians. %0a%3c %0a%3c The varieties of the palm are numerous. First of all, there %0a%3c are those which do not exceed the size of a shrub ; they are %0a%3c mostly barren, though sometimes they are known to produce %0a%3c fruit ; the branches are short, and the tree is well covered with %0a%3c leaves all round. In many places this tree is used as a kind %0a%3c of rough-cast," as it were, to protect the walls of houses %0a%3c against damp. The palms of greater height form whole %0a%3c forests, the trunk of the tree being protected all round by %0a%3c pointed leaves, which are arranged in the form of a comb ; %0a%3c these, it must be understood, are wild palms, though sometimes, %0a%3c by some wajnvard fancy or other, they are known to make %0a%3c their appearance among the cultivated varieties. The other %0a%3c kinds are tall, round, and tapering ; and being furnished with %0a%3c dense and projecting knobs or circles in the bark, arranged in %0a%3c regular gradation, they are found easy of ascent by the people %0a%3c in the East ; in order to do which, the climber fastens a loop %0a%3c of osier round his body and the trunk, and by this contrivance %0a%3c ascends the tree with astonishing rapidity. All the foliage is %0a%3c at the summit, and the fruit as well ; this last being situate, %0a%3c not among the leaves, as is the case with other trees, but %0a%3c hanging in clusters from shoots of its own among the %0a%3c branches, and partaking of the nature both of the grape and %0a%3c the apple. The leaves terminate in a sharp edge, like that of %0a%3c a knife, while the sides are deeply indented — a peculiarity %0a%3c %0a%3c Or in a wild state. %0a%3c " " Tectorii vicem." They were probably planted in rows, close to the %0a%3c wall. %0a%3c %0a%3c " This mode of ascending the date-palm is still practised in the East. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. :.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c THE PALM-TREE. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 171 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Avhich first gave the idea of a troop of soldiers presenting face %0a%3c oil two sides at once ; at the present day they are split asunder^^ %0a%3c to form ropes and wythes for fastening, as well as light um- %0a%3c brellas'* for covering the head. %0a%3c %0a%3c The more diligent'^ enquirers into the operations of Nature %0a%3c state that all trees, or rather all plants, and other productions %0a%3c of the earth, belong to either one sex or the other ; a fact %0a%3c which it may be sufficient to notice on the present occasion, %0a%3c and one which manifests itself in no tree more than in the %0a%3c palm. The male tree blossoms at the shoots ; the female buds %0a%3c without blossoming, the bud being very similar to an ear of %0a%3c corn. In both trees the flesh of the fruit shows first, and %0a%3c after that the woody part inside of it, or, in other words, the %0a%3c seed : and that this is really the case, is proved by the fact, that %0a%3c we often find small fruit on the same shoot without any seed in %0a%3c it at all. This seed is of an oblong shape, and not rounded %0a%3c like the olive-stone. It is also divided down the back by a %0a%3c deep indentation, and in most specimens of this fruit there %0a%3c is exactly in the middle a sort of navel, as it were, from which %0a%3c the root of the tree first takes its growth.'® In planting this %0a%3c seed it is laid on its anterior surface, two being placed side %0a%3c by side, while as many more are placed above ; for when %0a%3c planted singly, the tree that springs up is but weak and %0a%3c sickly, whereas the four seeds all unite and form one strong %0a%3c tree. The seed is divided from the flesh of the fruit bj^ several %0a%3c coats of a whitish colour, some of which are attached to the %0a%3c body of it ; it lies but loosely in the inside of the fruit, ad- %0a%3c liering only to the summit by a single thread." %0a%3c %0a%3c The flesh of this fruit takes a year to ripen, though in some %0a%3c places, Cyprus'® for instance, even if it should not reach ma- %0a%3c turity, it is very agreeable, for the sweetness of its flavour : %0a%3c the leaf of the tree too, in that island, is broader than else- %0a%3c where, and the fruit rounder than usual : the body of the fruit %0a%3c %0a%3c " See B. xvi. c. 37. %0a%3c %0a%3c " "Umbracula."

In addition to the above parti- %0a%3c culars, it is asserted that in a forest of natural growth the %0a%3c female-^ trees will become barren if they ai'c deprived of the %0a%3c males, and that many female trees may be seen surrounding a %0a%3c single male with downcast heads and a foliage that seems to be %0a%3c bowing caressingly towards it ; while the male trcoj on the %0a%3c other hand, with leaves all bristling and erect, by its exha- %0a%3c lations, and even the very sight of it and the dust^' from %0a%3c off it, fecundates the others : if the male tree, too, should %0a%3c happen to be cut down, the female trees, thus reduced to a state %0a%3c of widowhood, will at once become barren and unproductive. %0a%3c So well, indeed, is this sexual union between them understood, %0a%3c that it has been imagined even that fecundation may be en- %0a%3c sured through the agency of man, by means of the blossoms %0a%3c and the down^^ gathered from off the male trees, and, indeed, %0a%3c sometimes by only sprinkling the dust from off them on the %0a%3c female trees. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 8. — HOW THE PALM-TREE IS PLANTED. %0a%3c %0a%3c Palm-trees are also propagated by planting ; the trunk is %0a%3c first divided with certain fissures two cubits in length which %0a%3c communicate with the pith of the tree, and is then buried in %0a%3c the earth. A slip also torn away from the root will produce %0a%3c a sucker with vitality, and the same may be obtained from the %0a%3c more tender among the branches. In Assyria, the tree itself %0a%3c %0a%3c This is said solely in relation to the date of Cyprus. %0a%3c %0a%3c 20 Or " dwellers in tents;" similar to the modern Bedouins. %0a%3c %0a%3c 21 Fee remarks, that in these words we find the first germs of the sexual %0a%3c system that has been established by the modern botanists. He thinks that %0a%3c it is clearly shown by this account, that Pliny was acquainted with the %0a%3c fecundation of plants by the agency of the pollen. %0a%3c %0a%3c In allusion to the pollen, possibly. See the last Note. %0a%3c %0a%3c 23 "Lanugine." It is possible that in the use of this word, also, he %0a%3c may allude to the pollen. Under the term "pulvis," "dust," he probably %0a%3c alludes in exaggerated terms to the same theory. %0a%3c %0a%3c 2* The same methods of propagating the palm are still followed in the %0a%3c East, and in the countries near the tropics. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 9.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c PALM-TBEES. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 173 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c is sometimes laid level, and then covered over in a moist soil ; %0a%3c upon which it will throw out roots all over, but it will grow %0a%3c only to be a number of shrubs, and never a tree : hence it is %0a%3c that they plant nurseries, and transplant the young trees when %0a%3c a year old, and again when two years old, as they thrive all %0a%3c the better for being transplanted ; this is done in the spring %0a%3c season in other countries, but in Assyria about the rising of the %0a%3c Dog-star. In those parts they do not touch the young trees %0a%3c with the knife, but merely tie up the foliage that they may %0a%3c shoot upwards, and so attain considerable height. When %0a%3c they are strong they prune them, in order to increase their %0a%3c thickness, but in so doing leave the branches for about half a %0a%3c foot ; indeed, if they were cut off at any other place, the ope- %0a%3c ration would kill the parent tree. We have already men- %0a%3c tioned that they thrive particularly well in a saltish soil ; %0a%3c hence, when the soil is not of that nature, it is the custom to %0a%3c scatter salt, not exactly about the roots, but at a little distance %0a%3c off. There are palm-trees in Syria and in Egypt which divide %0a%3c into two ti'unks, and some in Crete into three and as many as %0a%3c five even.'^ Some of these trees bear immediately at the end of %0a%3c three years, and in Cyprus, Syria, and Egypt, when they are %0a%3c four years old ; others again at the end of five years : at which %0a%3c l)eriod the tree is about the height of a man. So long as the %0a%3c tree is quite young the fruit has no seed within, from which %0a%3c circumstance it has received the nickname of the " eunuch."" %0a%3c %0a%3c CHA.P. 9. — THE DIFFERENT VARIETIES OF PALM-TREES, AND THELK %0a%3c CHARACTERISTICS. %0a%3c %0a%3c There are numerous varieties of the palm-tree. In Assyria, %0a%3c and throughout the whole of Persis, the barren kinds are made %0a%3c use of for carpenters' work, and the various appliances of %0a%3c luxury.

This stone is enclosed in several coats, more or less %0a%3c in number ; sometimes they are of a thick texture, and some- %0a%3c times very thin. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence it is that we find nine and forty different kinds of %0a%3c palm-trees, if any one will be at the trouble of enumerating all %0a%3c their various barbarous names, and the different wines that are %0a%3c extracted from them. The most famous of all, are those %0a%3c which, for the sake of distinction, have received the name of %0a%3c "royal" palms, because they were preserved solely by the %0a%3c kings of Persia ; these used to grow nowhere but at Babylon, %0a%3c and there only in the garden of Bagous,^* that being the %0a%3c Persian for an eunuch, several of whom have even reigned %0a%3c over that country !

These last are short, white, %0a%3c and round, and bear a stronger resemblance to grapes than to %0a%3c dates ; for which reason it is that they have received their %0a%3c name, in consequence of their close resemblance to " marga- %0a%3c ritae," or pearls. It is said that there is only one tree that %0a%3c bears them, and that in the locality known as Chora." The %0a%3c same is the case also with the tree that bears the syagri. "We %0a%3c have heard a wonderful story too, relative to this last tree, to %0a%3c the effect that it dies and comes to life again in a similar %0a%3c manner to the phoenix, which, it is generally thought, has %0a%3c boiTowed its name fi-om the palm-tree, in consequence of this %0a%3c peculiarity ; at the moment that I am writing this, that tree %0a%3c is still bearing fruit. As for the fruit itself, it is large, hard, %0a%3c and of a rough appearance, and differing in taste from all other %0a%3c kinds, having a sort of -wild flavour peculiar to itself, and %0a%3c not unlike that of the flesh of the wild boar ; it is evidently %0a%3c this circumstance from which it has derived its name of %0a%3c " syagrus." %0a%3c %0a%3c In the fourth rank are the dates called " sandalides," from %0a%3c their resemblance to a sandal in shape. It is stated, that on %0a%3c the confines of Ethiopia there are but five of these trees at %0a%3c the most, no less remarkable for the singular lusciousness of %0a%3c their fruit, than for their extreme rarity.

The Nicolaan" %0a%3c dates are of a similar kind, but somewhat drier; they are %0a%3c of remarkable size, so much so, indeed, that four of them, %0a%3c placed end to end, will make a cubit in length. A less line %0a%3c kind, but of sister quality to the caryotse for flavour, are the %0a%3c " adeljihides,"^^ hence so called ; these come next to them in %0a%3c sweetness, but still are by no means their equals. A third %0a%3c kind, again, are the patetce, which abound in juice to excess, %0a%3c so much so, indeed, that the fruit bursts, in its excess of liquor, %0a%3c even upon the parent tree, and presents all the appearance of %0a%3c having been trodden^'' under foot. %0a%3c %0a%3c There are numerous kinds of dates also, of a drier nature, %0a%3c which are long and slender, and sometimes of a curved shape. %0a%3c Those of this sort which we consecrate to the worship of the %0a%3c gods are called " chydaei by the Jews, a nation remarkable %0a%3c for the contempt which they manifest of the divinities. Those %0a%3c found all over Thebais and Arabia are dry and small, with a %0a%3c shrivelled body : being parched up and scorched by the con- %0a%3c stant heat, they are covered with what more nearly resembles %0a%3c a shell ■'^ than a skin. In -35thiopia the date is quite brittle %0a%3c even, so great is the driness of the climate ; hence the people %0a%3c are able to knead it into a kind of bread, just like so much %0a%3c %0a%3c *' Atbenaeus, B. xiv. c. 22, tells us that these dates were thus called %0a%3c from Nicolaus of Damascus, a Peripatetic philosopher, who, when visiting %0a%3c Eome with Herod the Great, made Augustus a present of the finest fruit %0a%3c of the palm-tree that could be procured. This fruit retained its name of %0a%3c "Nicolaan," down to the middle ages. %0a%3c %0a%3c Pliny would imply that they are so called from the Greek a^tX^ta, %0a%3c " a sister," as being of sister quality to the caryotae ; but it is much more %0a%3c probable, as Fee remarks, that they got this name from being attached in %0a%3c pairs to the same pedicle or stalk. %0a%3c %0a%3c Pliny certainly seems to imply that they are so called from the Greek %0a%3c Trar'toj, " to tread under foot," and Hardouiu is of that opinion. Fee, %0a%3c however, thinks the name is from the Hebrew or Syriac " patach," " to ex- %0a%3c pand," or "open," or else from the Hebrew "pathah," the name of the first %0a%3c vowel, from some fancied resemblance in the form. %0a%3c %0a%3c From the Greek ^vSalog, " vulgar," or " common," it is supposed. The %0a%3c Jews probably called them so, as being common, or offered by the Gentiles %0a%3c to their idols and divinities.

The blossoms appear %0a%3c in clusters, like those of the olive-tree, but are of a red colour ; %0a%3c the leaves are dense, and closely packed.

It bears fruit, not upon branches, but upon the trunk %0a%3c itself : the fig is remarkable for its extreme sweetness, and %0a%3c has no seeds"® in it. This tree is also remarkable for its fruit- %0a%3c fulness, which, however, can only be ensured by making inci- %0a%3c sions" in the fruit with hooks of iron, for otherwise it will %0a%3c not come to maturity. But when this has been done, it may %0a%3c be gathered within four days, immediately upon which another %0a%3c shoots up in its place. Hence it is that in the year it produces %0a%3c seven abundant crops, and throughout all the summer there is %0a%3c an abundance of milky juice in the fruit. Even if the inci- %0a%3c sions are not made, the fruit will shoot afresh four times %0a%3c during the summer, the new fruit supplanting the old, and %0a%3c forcing it off before it has ripened. The wood, which is of a %0a%3c very peculiar nature, is reckoned among the most useful %0a%3c known. When cut down it is immediately plunged into %0a%3c standing water, such being the means employed for drying"* it. %0a%3c At first it sinks to the bottom, after which it begins to float, %0a%3c and in a certain length of time the additional moisture sucks %0a%3c it drj', which has the effect of penetrating and soaking all"" %0a%3c %0a%3c 63 It is still used by curriers in preparing leather. %0a%3c %0a%3c 6* See B. xxiv. c. 79.

The trunk of the tree is %0a%3c similar to that of the poplar, and the leaves to those of the elm. %0a%3c It produces four crops in the year, and germinates the same %0a%3c number of times, but its green fruit will not ripen unless an %0a%3c incision is made in it to let out the milky juice. The sweet- %0a%3c ness of the fi-'uit and the appearance of the inside are in all %0a%3c respects similar to those of the fig, and in size it is about as %0a%3c large as a sorb-apple. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 16.

For this reason, committing a manifest error, %0a%3c some persons" have called it the Egyptian fig; it being the %0a%3c fact that this tree does not grow in Egypt, but in Syria and' %0a%3c Ionia, in the vicinity, too, of Cnidos, and in the island of %0a%3c Rhodes.

This tree produces %0a%3c without intermission, for if the fruit is pulled to-day, fresh %0a%3c fruit will make its appearance to-morrow : the time for ripen- %0a%3c ing is while the Etesian'* winds prevail. The fruit of this %0a%3c tree is more oblong than a pear, but is enclosed in a shell and %0a%3c a rind of a grassy colour, like the almond ; but what is found %0a%3c within, instead of being a nut as in the almond, is a plum, %0a%3c differing from the almond'^ in being shorter and quite soft. This %0a%3c fruit, although particularly inviting for its luscious sweetness, %0a%3c is productive of no injurious effects. The wood, for its good- %0a%3c ness, solidity, and blackness, is in no respect inferior to that %0a%3c of the lotus : people have been in the habit of making statues %0a%3c of it. The wood of the tree which we have mentioned as %0a%3c the " balanus,"^" although very durable, is not so highly es- %0a%3c teemed as this, as it is knotted and twisted in the grcatf^r %0a%3c part : hence it is only employed for the purposes of ship- %0a%3c building. %0a%3c %0a%3c '6 See B. xviii. c. 74. %0a%3c %0a%3c Fee identifies it with the Egyptian almond, mentioned hy Pliny in %0a%3c B.

The flower, too, has a pretty effect when made %0a%3c into garlands, and is extremely useful in medicinal preparations. %0a%3c A gum, also, distils from this tree ; but the principal merit %0a%3c that it possesses is, that when it is cut down, it will grow %0a%3c again within three years. It grows in the vicinity of Thebes, %0a%3c where we also find the quercus, the Persian tree, and the olive : %0a%3c the spot that produces it is a piece of woodland, distant three %0a%3c %0a%3c Many have taken this to be the cocoa-nut tree ; but, as Fee remarks, %0a%3c that is a tree of India, and this of Egypt. There is little doubt that it is %0a%3c the doum of the Arabs, the Cucifera Thebaica of Delille. The timber of %0a%3c the trunk is much used in Egypt, and of the leaves carpets, bags, and %0a%3c panniers are made. In fact, the description of it and its fruit is almost %0a%3c identical with that here given by Pliny. %0a%3c %0a%3c The seed or stone of the doum is still used in Egypt for making the %0a%3c beads of chaplets : it admits of a very high polish. %0a%3c ^ Matcrics crispioris elegantise. %0a%3c %0a%3c See B. xxiv. c. 67.

This tree never loses %0a%3c its leaves. The seed in the fruit is of considerable size, but %0a%3c the flesh of it, by reason of its quality, and the great abund- %0a%3c ance in which it grows, affords quite a harvest to the inhabit- %0a%3c ants of those parts ; after cleaning it, they subject it to pressure, %0a%3c and then make it up into cakes for keeping. There was for- %0a%3c merly ^ a woodland district in the vicinity of Memphis, -with %0a%3c trees of such enormous size, that three men could not span %0a%3c one with their arms : one of these trees is remarkable, not for %0a%3c its fruit, or any particular use that it is, but for the singular %0a%3c phajnomenon that it presents. In appearance it strongly re- %0a%3c sembles a thorn,^' and it has leaves which have all the appear- %0a%3c ance of wings, and which fall immediately the branch is %0a%3c touched by any one, and then immediately shoot again. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 20. (11.) NINE KINDS OF GUM. THE SAECOCOLLA. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is universally agreed, that the best gum is that produced %0a%3c from the Egyptian thorn ; it is of variegated appearance, of %0a%3c azure colouo.', clean, free from all admixture of bark, and %0a%3c adheres to the teeth ; the price at which it sells is three %0a%3c denarii per pound. That produced from the bitter almond- %0a%3c %0a%3c 85 This is from Theophrastus, Hist. Plant. B. iv. c. 3. Fee suggests %0a%3c that it may have been a kind of myrobalanus.

From the use of this word he seems uncertain as to its ex- %0a%3c istence in his time ; the account is copied from Theophrastus, Hist. Plant. %0a%3c B. iv. c. 3. Fee suggests that he may here allude to the Baobab, the %0a%3c Adansonia digitata, which grows in Senegal and Sennaar to an enormous %0a%3c size. Prosper Alpinus speaks of it as existing in Egypt. The Arabs call %0a%3c it El-omarah, and the fruit El-kongles. %0a%3c %0a%3c 87 The Mimosa polyacanthe, probably. Fee says that the mimosae, re- %0a%3c spectively known as casta, pudibunda, viva, and sensitiva, with many of %0a%3c the inga, and other leguminous trees, are irritable in the highest degree. %0a%3c The tree here spoken of he considers to be one of the acacias. The pas- %0a%3c sage in Theophrastus speaks of the leaf as shrinking, and not falling, %0a%3c and then as simply reviving. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Acacia Nilotica of Linnaeus, from which we derive the gum %0a%3c Arabic of commerce ; and of which a considerable portion is still derived %0a%3c fi-om Egji)t. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 21.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c THE PAPYRUS. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 185 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c tree and the cherry^^ is of an inferior kind, and that which is %0a%3c gathered from the phim-tree is the worst of all.

Gum is also found %0a%3c on the elm^- upon Mount Corycus in Cilicia, and upon the %0a%3c juniper,'^ but it is good for nothing ; indeed, the gum of the %0a%3c elm found there is apt to breed gnats. From the sarcocolla^* %0a%3c also — such is the name of a certain tree — a gum exudes that is %0a%3c remarkably useful to painters and medical men ; it is similar %0a%3c to incense dust in appearance, and for those purposes the white %0a%3c kind is preferable to the red.

M. Varro informs us that paper owes its discovery to %0a%3c %0a%3c *9 These gums are chemically different from gum Arabic, and they arc %0a%3c u.sed for different purposes in the arts. %0a%3c %0a%3c The vine does not produce a gum ; but when the sap ascends, a juice %0a%3c is secreted, which sometimes becomes solid on the evaporation of the %0a%3c ac(ueous particles. This substance contains acetate of potassa, which, by %0a%3c the decomposition of that salt, becomes a carbonate of the same base. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is not a gum, but a resinous product of a peculiar nature. It is %0a%3c known to the moderns by tlw name of " olivine." %0a%3c %0a%3c " The sap of the cini leaves a saline deposit on the bark, principally %0a%3c formed of carbonate of potassa. Fee is at a loss to know whether Pliny %0a%3c here alludes to this or to the manna which is incidentally formed by certain %0a%3c insects on some trees and reeds. But, as be justly says, would Pliny say %0a%3c of the latter that it is " ad nihil utile"—" good for nothing".? %0a%3c %0a%3c A resinous product, no doubt.

In succeeding ages, public docu- %0a%3c ments were inscribed on sheets of lead, while private memo- %0a%3c randa were impressed upon linen cloths, or else engraved on %0a%3c tablets of wax ; indeed, we find it stated in Homer, that tablets %0a%3c were employed for this purpose even before the time of the %0a%3c Trojan war.

THE MODE OF MAKING PAPEE. %0a%3c %0a%3c Papyrus grows either in the marshes of Egypt, or in the %0a%3c sluggish waters of the river Nile, when they have overflowed %0a%3c and are lying stagnant, in pools that do not exceed a couple of %0a%3c cubits in depth. The root lies obliquely, * and is about the %0a%3c %0a%3c 5' It is hardly necessary' to state that this is not the fact.

It is most probable that %0a%3c this king introduced extensive improvements in the manufacture of parch- %0a%3c ment, for Herodotus mentions writing on skins as common in his time ; and %0a%3c in B.

It was mostly terminated by the fir cone, that tree being %0a%3c dtdicated to Bacchus, in consequence of the use of its cones and turpentine %0a%3c in making wine.

The description here given is otherwise very correct. %0a%3c %0a%3c * Among the ancients the term papyrus was used as a general appellation %0a%3c for all the different plants of the genus Cyperus, which was used for making %0a%3c mats, boats, baskets, and numerous other articles : but one species only %0a%3c was employed for making paper, the Cyperus papyrus, or Byblos. l ee %0a%3c states that the papyrus is no longer to be found in the Delta, where it for- %0a%3c merly abounded.

" llieratica'"" was the name %0a%3c that was ancicntlj'' given to it, from the circumstance that it %0a%3c was entirely reserved for the religious books. In later times, %0a%3c through a spirit of adulation, it received the name of " Au- %0a%3c gusta," just as that of second quality was called " Liviana," %0a%3c from his wife, Livia ; the consequence of which was, that the %0a%3c name "hieratica" came to designate that of only third-rate %0a%3c quality. The paper of the next quality was called " amphi- %0a%3c theatrica," from the locality" of its manufacture. The skilful %0a%3c manufactory that was established by Pannius'''^ at Rome, was in %0a%3c the habit of receiving this last kind, and there, by a very %0a%3c careful process of insertion, it was rendered much finer; so %0a%3c much so, that from being a common sort, he made it a paper of %0a%3c first-rate quality, and gave his own'^ name to it: while that %0a%3c which was not subjected to this additional process retained %0a%3c its original name of amphitheatrica." Next to this is the %0a%3c Saitic paper, so called from the city of that name, " where %0a%3c it is manufactured in very large quantities, though of cuttings %0a%3c of inferior quality. The Tajniotic paper, so called from a %0a%3c place in the vicinity,^^ is manufactured from the materials that %0a%3c lie nearer to the outside skin ; it is sold, not according to its %0a%3c quality, but by weight only.

The Romans were in the habit of purchasing it %0a%3c largely in the latter state, and then washing off the writing, and using it %0a%3c as paper of the finest quality. Hence it received the name of "Augustus," %0a%3c as representing in Latin its Greek name " hieraticus," or " sacred." lu %0a%3c length of time it became the common impression, as here mentioned, that %0a%3c this name was given to it in honour of Augustus Caesar. %0a%3c %0a%3c 11 Near the amphitheatre, probably, of Alexandria. %0a%3c %0a%3c He alludes to Q.

After this comes the bark of the papyrus, %0a%3c the outer skin of which bears a strong resemblance to the %0a%3c bulrush, and is solely used for making ropes, and then only %0a%3c for those which have to go into the water.^* %0a%3c %0a%3c All these various kinds of paper are made upon a table, %0a%3c moistened with Nile water ; a liquid which, when in a %0a%3c muddy state, has the peculiar qualities of glue.'' This table %0a%3c being first inclined,-" the leaves of papyrus are laid upon it %0a%3c lengthwise, as long, indeed, as the papyrus will admit of, the %0a%3c jagged edges being cut off at cither end ; after which a cross %0a%3c layer is placed over it, the same way, in fact, that hurdles are %0a%3c made. When this is done, the leaves are pressed close together, %0a%3c and then dried in the sun ; after which they are united to one %0a%3c another, the best sheets being always taken first, and the infe- %0a%3c rior ones added afterwards. There are never more than %0a%3c twenty of these sheets to a roU.^' %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 24. THE MODE OF TESTING THE GOODNESS OF PAPEK. %0a%3c %0a%3c There is a great difference in the breadth of the various %0a%3c kinds of paper. That of best quality is thirteen fingers wide, %0a%3c while the hicratica is two fingers less. The Fanniana is ten %0a%3c fingers wide, and that knowTi as " amphitheatrica," one less. %0a%3c The Saitic is of still smaller breadth, indeed it is not so %0a%3c wide as the mallet with which the paper is beaten ; and the %0a%3c emporetica is particularly narrow, being not more than six %0a%3c fingers in breadth. %0a%3c %0a%3c In addition to the above particulars, paper is esteemed %0a%3c according to its fineness, its stoutness, its whiteness, and its %0a%3c smoothness.

"With M.

To obviate these inconveniences, a groundwork of %0a%3c paper was made with leaves of the second quality, over which %0a%3c was laid a Avoof, as it were, formed of leaves of the first. He %0a%3c increased the width also of paper ; the width [of the common %0a%3c sort] being made a foot, and that of the size known as "macro- %0a%3c coUum,"'*^ a cubit ; though one inconvenience was soon detected %0a%3c in it, for, upon a single leaf** being torn in the press, more %0a%3c pages were apt to be spoilt than before.'"* In consequence of %0a%3c the advantages above-mentioned, the Claudian has come to be %0a%3c preferred to all other kinds of paper, though the Augustan is %0a%3c still used for the purposes of epistolary correspondence.

THE PECULIAR DEFECTS IN PAPER. %0a%3c %0a%3c The roughness and inequalities in paper are smoothed down %0a%3c with a tooth*® or shell ; but the writing in such places is very %0a%3c apt to fade. When it is thus polished the paper does not take %0a%3c the ink so readily, but is of a more lustrous and shining surface. %0a%3c The water of the Nile that has been originally employed in %0a%3c its manufacture, being sometimes used without due precaution, %0a%3c will unfit the paper for taking writing : this fault, however, %0a%3c may be detected by a blow with the mallet, or even by %0a%3c the smell,-' when the carelessness has been extreme.

It is not unlikely that his meaning is that the %0a%3c breadth being doubled, the tearing of one leaf or half breadth entailed of %0a%3c necessity the spoiling of another, making the corresponding half breadth. %0a%3c %0a%3c 26 He perhaps means a portion of an elephant's tusk. %0a%3c 2^ Meaning a damp, musty smell. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 27.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c THE BOOKS OF NUMA. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 191 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c spots, too, may be detected by the eye ; but the streaks that %0a%3c run down the middle of the leaves where they have been %0a%3c pasted together, though they render the paper spongy and of %0a%3c a soaking nature, can hardly ever be detected before the ink %0a%3c runs, while the pen is forming the letters ; so many are the %0a%3c openings for fraud to bo put in practice. The consequence is, %0a%3c that another labour has been added to the due preparation %0a%3c of paper. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 26. THE PASTE USED IN THE PREPARATION OF PAPER. %0a%3c %0a%3c The common paper paste is made of the finest flour of wheat %0a%3c mixed with boiling water, and some sniall drops of vinegar %0a%3c sprinkled in it : for the ordinary workman's paste, or gum, %0a%3c if employed for this purpose, will render the paper brittle. %0a%3c Those, however, who take the greatest pains, boil the crumb %0a%3c of leavened bread, and then strain off" the water : by the %0a%3c adoption of this method the paper has the fewest seams caused %0a%3c by the paste that lies between, and is softer than the nap of %0a%3c linen even. All kinds of paste that are used for this purpose, %0a%3c ought not to be older or newer than one day. The paper is %0a%3c then thinned out with a mallet, after which a new layer of %0a%3c paste is placed upon it ; then the creases which have formed %0a%3c are again pressed out, and it then undergoes the same process %0a%3c with the mallet as before. It is thus that we have memorials %0a%3c preserved in the ancient hand\\Titing of Tiberius and Caius %0a%3c Gracchus, which I have seen in the possession of Pomponius %0a%3c Secundus,^® the poet, a very illustrious citizen, almost two %0a%3c hundred years since those characters were penned. As for the %0a%3c handwriting of Cicero, Augustus, and Virgil, we frequently %0a%3c see them at the present dny. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 27. (13.) — THE BOOKS OF NUMA. %0a%3c %0a%3c There are some facts of considerable importance which make %0a%3c against the opinion expressed by M. Varro, relative to the %0a%3c invention of paper. Cassius Hemina, a writer of very great %0a%3c antiquity, has stated in the Fourth Book of his Annals, that %0a%3c Cneius Terentius, the scribe, while engaged in digging on his %0a%3c %0a%3c See B. vii. c. 18, and B. xiv. c. 6.

This took place in tli( %0a%3c consulship of Publius Cornelius Cethegus, the son of Lucius, %0a%3c and of M. Ecebius Taraphilus, the son of Quintus, the interval %0a%3c between whose consulship and the reign of Numa Avas five %0a%3c hundred and thirty-five years. These books Avere made of %0a%3c paper, and, a thing that is more remarkable still, is the fact %0a%3c that they lasted so many years buried in the ground. In %0a%3c order, therefore, to establish a fact of such singular import- %0a%3c ance, I shall here quote the woi'ds of Hemina himself — " !Some %0a%3c persons expressed wender how these books could have possibly %0a%3c lasted so long a time — this was the explanation that Teren- %0a%3c tius gave : ' In nearly the middle of the coffer there lay a square • %0a%3c stone, bound on every side with cords enveloped in wax %0a%3c upon this stone tlie books had been placed, and it was through %0a%3c this precaution, he thought, that they had not rotted. The %0a%3c books, too, were carefully covered with citrus leaves,^' and it %0a%3c was through this, in his belief, that they had been protected %0a%3c from the attacks of worms.' In these books were written %0a%3c certain doctrines relative to the Pythagorean philosophy ; they %0a%3c were burnt by Q. Petilius, the praetor, because they treated %0a%3c of philosophical subjects. %0a%3c %0a%3c Piso, who had formerly been censor, relates the same facts %0a%3c in the Pirst Book of his Commentaries, but he states in addition, %0a%3c T.hat there were seven books on Pontifical Rights, and seven on %0a%3c the Pythagorean philosophy.^^ Tuditanus, in his Fourteenth %0a%3c Book, says that they contained the decrees of Jfuma : Varro, in %0a%3c the Seventh Book of his " Antiquities of Mankind," ^* states that %0a%3c they were twelve in number ; and Antias, in his Second Book, %0a%3c says that there were twelve written in Latin, on pontifical %0a%3c %0a%3c This story, no doubt, deserves to be rejected as totally fabulous, even %0a%3c though we have Hemina's word for it. %0a%3c 3" See B. xvi. c. 70. %0a%3c %0a%3c '1 B. xii. c. 7, and B. xiii. c. 31. It was thought that the leaves %0a%3c and juices of the cedar and the citrus preserved books and linen from the %0a%3c attacks of noxious insects. %0a%3c %0a%3c ^'^ And because, as Livy says, their doctrines were inimical to the then %0a%3c existing religion. %0a%3c %0a%3c 33 Val. I\Iaximus says that there Avere some books written in Latin, on %0a%3c the pontifical rights, and others in Greek on philosophical subjects. %0a%3c 3i Humanas Antiquitates. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 28.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c THE TREES OF ETHIOPIA. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 193 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c matters, and as many in Greek, containing philosophical pre- %0a%3c cepts. The same author states also in his Third Book why- %0a%3c it was thought proper to burn them. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is a fact acknowledged by all writers, that the SibyF^ %0a%3c brought three books to Tarquinius Suporbus, of which two %0a%3c were burnt by herself, while the third perished by fire with %0a%3c the CapitoP^ in the days of Sylla. In addition to these facts, %0a%3c Mucianus, who was three times consul, has stated that he had %0a%3c recently read, while governor of Lycia, a letter written upon %0a%3c paper, and preserved in a certain temple there, which had %0a%3c been written from Troy, by Sarpedon ; a thing that surprises %0a%3c me the more, if it really was the fact that even in the time %0a%3c of Homer the country that we call Egypt was not in exist- %0a%3c 'ence.^' And Avhy too, if paper was tlien in use, was it the %0a%3c custom, as it is very well known it was, to write upon leaden %0a%3c tablets and linen cloths ? Why, too, has Homer'^'* stated that %0a%3c in Lycia tablets^"^ were given to Bellerophon to carry, and not %0a%3c a paper letter ? %0a%3c %0a%3c Papyrus, for making paper, is apt to fail occasionally ; sucli %0a%3c a thing happened in the time of the Emperor Tiberius, when %0a%3c there was so great a scarcity*" of paper that members of the %0a%3c senate were appointed to regulate the distribution of it : had %0a%3c not this been done, all the ordinary relations of life would %0a%3c have been completely disarranged. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 28.

(15.) — THE TREES OP MOUNT ATLAS. THE CITRUS, AND %0a%3c THE TABLES MADE OF THE WOOD THEREOF. %0a%3c %0a%3c !Mount Atlas is said to possess a forest of trees of a peculiar %0a%3c character,** of which we have already spolien.*" In the vicinity %0a%3c of this mountain is Mauretania, a countrj^ which abounds in %0a%3c the citrus," a tree which gave rise to the mania*'* for fine %0a%3c tables, an extravagance with which the women reproach the %0a%3c men, when they complain of their vast outlay upon pearls. %0a%3c There is preserved to the present day a table which belonged %0a%3c to M. Cicero,*" and for which, notwithstanding liis comjjara- %0a%3c tively moderate means, and Avhat is even more surprising still, %0a%3c at that day too, he gave no less than one*" million sesterces : %0a%3c we find mention made also of one belonging to Gallus Asinius, %0a%3c Avhich cost one million one hundred thousand sesterces. Two %0a%3c tables were also sold hy auction Avhich Imd belonged to King %0a%3c ■Tuba ; the price fetched by one was one million two hundred %0a%3c thousand sesterces, and that of the other something less. %0a%3c There has been lately destroyed by fire, a table which came %0a%3c down from the family of the Cethegi, and which had been sold %0a%3c for the sum of one million four hundred thousand sesterces, %0a%3c the price of a considerable domain, if any one, indeed, could be %0a%3c found who would give so large a sum for an estate. %0a%3c %0a%3c ■•^ In c. 9 of the present Book.

The largest %0a%3c table that is made of a single piece of wood, is the one that %0a%3c takes its name*- from Nomius, a freedmnn of Tiberius Caesar. %0a%3c The diameter of it is four feet, short by three quarters of an %0a%3c inch, and it is half a foot in thickness, less the same fraction. %0a%3c AViiile speaking uptm tliis subject, I ought not to omit to men- %0a%3c tion that the Emperor Tiberius had a table that exceeded four %0a%3c feet iu diameter by two inches and a (juarter, and Avas an incli %0a%3c and a half in tliickness : this, however, was only covered with %0a%3c a veneer of citrus-wood, while that which belonged to his %0a%3c frecdman Nomius was so costly, the whole material of which %0a%3c it was composed being knotted wood. %0a%3c %0a%3c These knots are proper!}' a disease or excrescence of the %0a%3c root, and those used for this purpose are more particularly %0a%3c esteemed wliich have lain entirel}' concealed under ground; %0a%3c they are much more rare than those that grow above ground, %0a%3c and that are to be found on the branches also. Thus, to speak %0a%3c correctl)', that which we buy at so vast a price is in reality a %0a%3c defect in the tree : of the size and root of it a notion may be %0a%3c easily formed from the circular sections of its trunk. The %0a%3c tree resembles the wild female cypress^^ in its foliage, smell, %0a%3c and the appearance of the trunk. A spot called Mount Anco- %0a%3c rarius, in Nearer Mauretania, used Ibrnierly to furnish the %0a%3c most esteemed citrus-wood, but at the present day the su2)ply %0a%3c is quite exhausted. %0a%3c %0a%3c CflAr. 30. — T1II5 POINTS TH.^VT ARE DESIR.ABLE OR OTHEKWISK IN %0a%3c THESE TABLES. %0a%3c %0a%3c The principal merit of those tables is to have veins** arranged %0a%3c %0a%3c *' This is considered notliing remarkable at the jireseiit day, such is the %0a%3c sldll displayed by our cabinet-iuakcrs. %0a%3c %0a%3c *- Called '■ Isomiaiia." *^ Tuber. %0a%3c %0a%3c *' The European cyprus, tlio Cupressu.s serapsrvireus of Linn cus. %0a%3c " These veins were nothing in rcalitv but the lines of the layers or %0a%3c %0a%3c o 2 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 196 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c pliny's katueal histout. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XII!. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c in waving lines, or else forming spirals like so many little %0a%3c whirlpools.

There are' %0a%3c some tables also with wavy, undulating marks, and which aiv %0a%3c more particularly esteemed if these resemble the eyes on a %0a%3c peacock's tail. Next in esteem to these last, as well as those %0a%3c previously mentioned, is the veined wood,** covered, as it were, %0a%3c with dense masses of grain, for Avhich reason these tabk s have %0a%3c received the name of '' apiatao." ^* But the colour of the wood %0a%3c is the quality that is held in the highest esteem of all : that %0a%3c of wine mixed with honey^" being the most prized, the veinsbeiiig %0a%3c peculiai-ly refulgent. Next to the colour, it is the size that is %0a%3c prized ; at the present day whole trunks are greatly admired, %0a%3c and sometimes several are united in a single table. %0a%3c %0a%3c The peculiar defects in these kinds of tables are woodiness," %0a%3c such being the name given to the table when the wood is dull, %0a%3c common-looking, indistinct, or else has mere simple marks %0a%3c upon it, resembling the leaves of the plane-tree ; also, when %0a%3c it resembles the veins of the holm-oak or the colour of that %0a%3c tree; and, a fault to which it is peculiarly liable Irom the %0a%3c etfect of heat or wind, when it has flaws in it or hair-like lines %0a%3c resembling flaws ; when it has a black mark, too, running %0a%3c through it resembling a murena in appearance, various streaks %0a%3c that look like crow scratches, or knots like poppy heads, with a %0a%3c colour all over nearly approaching to black, or blotches of a %0a%3c sickly hue. The barbarous tribes bury this wood in the %0a%3c ground while green, first giving it a coating of wax. When %0a%3c it comes into the workmen's hands, they ])ut it for seven days %0a%3c beneath a heap of corn, and then take it out for as many %0a%3c %0a%3c strata lignea, running perpendicularly in tlie trunk, and the number of %0a%3c which denotes the age of the tree. %0a%3c 56 %3ci Tigrinae." %0a%3c %0a%3c " Pantherinaj."

Shipwrecks have recently taught us also that this %0a%3c wood is dried by the action of sea-Avater, and that it thereby %0a%3c acquires a hardness^- and a degree of density which render it %0a%3c proof against corruption : no other method is equally sure to %0a%3c produce these results. These tables are kept best, and shine %0a%3c with the greatest lustre, when rubbed with the dry hand, %0a%3c more particularly just after bathing. As if this wood had %0a%3c been created for the behoof of wine, it receives no injury %0a%3c from it. %0a%3c %0a%3c (16.) As this tree is one among the elements of more civil- %0a%3c ized life, I think that it is as well on the present occasion to %0a%3c dwell a little further upon it. It was known to Homer even, %0a%3c aud in the Greek it is known by the name of " thyon,"^'' or %0a%3c sometimes " thya." He says that the wood of this tree was %0a%3c among the unguents that were burnt for their pleasant odour %0a%3c by Circe,"' whom he would represent as being a goddess ; a %0a%3c circumstance which shows the great mistake committed by %0a%3c those wlio suppose that perfumes are meant under that name,'''* %0a%3c seeing that in the very same line he says that cedar aud larcli %0a%3c were burnt along with this wood, a thing that clearly proves %0a%3c that it is only of different trees that he is speaking. Theo- %0a%3c jjhrastus, an author who wrote in the age succeeding that of %0a%3c Alexander the Great, and about the year of the City of Rome %0a%3c 440, has awarded a very high rank to this tree, stating that it %0a%3c is related that the raftering of the ancient temples used to be %0a%3c made of this wood, aud that the timber, when employed iu %0a%3c roofs, will last for ever, so to say, being proof against all di'- %0a%3c cay, — quite incorruptible, in fact. He nho says that there is %0a%3c nothing more full of wavy veins"* than the root of this tree, and %0a%3c that there is no woikuuuiship in existence more precious tliau %0a%3c that made of this material. The finest kind of citrus grows, %0a%3c lie says, in the vicinity of the Temple of Jupiter Haramon ; %0a%3c he states also that it is produced in the low^er part of Cyre- %0a%3c luiica. He has made no meution, however, of the tables that %0a%3c are made of it ; indeed, wc have no more ancient accounts of %0a%3c %0a%3c Fee remarks that this is incorrect, and that this statement betrays an %0a%3c entire ignorance of the vegetable physiology. %0a%3c %0a%3c Siioi), " wood of sacrifice." %0a%3c " Od. 15.

This tree is used as an ornament to houses ; it re- %0a%3c quires, however, no further description. %0a%3c %0a%3c CIIAP. 32. (17.) THE LOTUS. %0a%3c %0a%3c Africa, too, at least that part of it which looks towards %0a%3c our shores, produces a remarkable tree, the lotus, ''^ by some %0a%3c known as the "celtis," which has also been naturalized in Italy,"* %0a%3c though it has been somewhat modified by the change of soil. %0a%3c The finest quality of lotus is that found in the vicinity of the %0a%3c Syrtes and among the Xasamones. It is the same size as tlic %0a%3c pear-tree, although Cornelius Nepos states to the eff'ect that it %0a%3c is but short. The leaves have numerous incisions, just as witli %0a%3c those of the holm-oak. There are many varieties of the lotus, %0a%3c which are characterized more particularly by the diffenmce in %0a%3c their respective fruits. The fruit is of about the size of a %0a%3c bean, and its colour is that of saffron, though before it is ripe %0a%3c it is continually changing its tints, like the grape. It has %0a%3c branches thickly set with leaves, like the myrtle, and not, %0a%3c as with us in Italy, like tlie cherry. In the country to %0a%3c which this tree is indigenous, the fruit of it is so remarkably %0a%3c sweet and luscious, that it has even given its name to a whole %0a%3c territory, and to a nation^' who, by their singular hospitality, %0a%3c have even seduced strangers who have come among them, to %0a%3c lose all remembrance of their native country. It is said also, %0a%3c that those who eat this fruit are subject to no maladies of llie %0a%3c stomach. The fruit which has no stone in the inside is the %0a%3c best : this stone in the other kind seems to be of an osseous %0a%3c nature. A wine is also extracted from this fruit very similar %0a%3c %0a%3c He alludes to the citron, the Citrus Medina of Linnaeus.

In- %0a%3c deed, we read that armies have been fed upon this food whan %0a%3c marching to and fro through the territory of Africa. The %0a%3c wood is of a black colour, and is held in high esteem for making %0a%3c flutes ; from the root also they manufacture handles for knives, %0a%3c and various other small articles. %0a%3c %0a%3c Such is the nature of the tree that is so called in Africa ; the %0a%3c same name being also given to a certain " herb, and to a stalk''^ %0a%3c that grows in Egypt belonging to the marsh plants. This last %0a%3c plant springs up when the waters of tlie Nile liave retired after %0a%3c its overflow : its stalk is similar to that of the bean, and its %0a%3c leaves are numerous and grow in tliick clusters, but are shorter %0a%3c and more slender than those of the bean. The fruit grows on %0a%3c the head of the plant, and is similar in appearance to a pop])y %0a%3c in its indentations" and all its other characteristics ; within %0a%3c tliere are small grains, similar to those of millet.'* The, in- %0a%3c habitants lay these heads in large heaps, and there let tlieui %0a%3c rot, after which they separate the grain from the residue by %0a%3c washing, and then dry it ; when this is done they pound it, %0a%3c and then use it as flour for making a kind of bread. What is %0a%3c stated in addition to these particulars, is a very singular'^ fact ; %0a%3c it is said that when the sun sets, these poppy-heads shut and %0a%3c cover themselves in the leaves, and at sun-rise they open %0a%3c again ; an alternation which continues until the fruit is per- %0a%3c fectly ripe, and the flower, which is white, falls off. %0a%3c %0a%3c (18.)

The andrachle is u %0a%3c wild tree, which never grows in the plain country, and is simi- %0a%3c lar to the arbiite tree in appearance, only that its leaves are %0a%3c smaller, and never fall off.

The ferula %0a%3c grows in hot countries and in places beyond sea, the stalk %0a%3c being divided into knotted joints. There are two kijids of it ; %0a%3c tliat which grows upwards to a great height the Greeks call %0a%3c by the name of " narthex," while the other, which never %0a%3c rises far from the ground, is known as the " nartliecya." %0a%3c From the joints very large leaves shoot forth, the largest lying %0a%3c nearest to the ground : in other respects it has the same na- %0a%3c ture as the anise, which it resembles also in its fruit. The %0a%3c wood of no shrub is lighter than this ; hence it is very easily %0a%3c carried, and the stalks of it make good walking-sticks" for %0a%3c the aged. %0a%3c %0a%3c CKAP. 43. THE THAPSIA. %0a%3c %0a%3c The seed of the ferula has been by some persons called %0a%3c "thapsia;"^* deceived, no doubt, by what is really the fact, %0a%3c that the thapsia is a ferula, but of a peculiar kind, with leaves %0a%3c like those of fennel, and a hollow stalk not exceeding a walk- %0a%3c ing-stick in length ; the seed is like that of the ferula, and %0a%3c the root of the plant is white. When an incision is made in %0a%3c the thnpsia, a milkj' juice oozes from it, and, when pounded, %0a%3c it produces a kind of juice ; the bark even is never thrown'" %0a%3c away. All these parts of the shrub are poisonous, and, in- %0a%3c deed, it is productive of injurious effects to those engaged in %0a%3c digging it up ; for if the slightest wind should happen to be %0a%3c blowing towards them from the shrub, the body begins to %0a%3c swell, and erysipelas attacks the face : it is for this reason that, %0a%3c before beginning work, they anoint the face all over with a %0a%3c solution of wax.

These plants, however, act thoii* part in %0a%3c serving as a pretext for the introduction of noxious agents ; %0a%3c and so great is the effrontery now displayed, that people would %0a%3c absolutely persuade one that poisons are a requisite adjunct to %0a%3c the practice of the medical art. %0a%3c %0a%3c The thapsia of Africa'^ is the most powerful of all.

It is quite as useful as %0a%3c the er\aim,^' but is apt to satiate more speedily : very little of %0a%3c it is necessary to fatten cattle ; to such a degree, indeed, that %0a%3c beasts of burden, when fed upon it, \vill very soon take a dis- %0a%3c like to barley. There is no fodder known, in fact, that is %0a%3c l^roductive of a greater abundance of milk, and of better qua- %0a%3c lity; in the medical treatment of cattle in particular, this %0a%3c shrub is found a most excellent specific for every kind of ma- %0a%3c lady. Even more than this, the same author recommends it, %0a%3c when first dried and then boiled in water, to be given to nurs- %0a%3c ing women, mixtMl with wine, in cases where the milk has %0a%3c failed them : and he says that, if this is done, the infant will %0a%3c be all the stronger and taller for it. In a green state, or, if %0a%3c dried, steeped in water, he recommends it for fowls. Both %0a%3c Democritus and Aristomachus promise us also that bees will %0a%3c never fail us so long as they can obtain the cytisus for food. %0a%3c There is no crop that we know of, of a similar nature, that %0a%3c costs a smaller price. It is sown at the same time as barley, %0a%3c or, at all events, in the spring, in seed like the leek, or else %0a%3c planted in the autumn, and before the winter solstice, in the stalk. %0a%3c When sown in grain, it ought to be steeped in water, and if %0a%3c %0a%3c 2» The Makron Tcichos.

It is trans- %0a%3c planted at the equinoxes, while the shrub is yet tender, and in %0a%3c three years it will arrive at maturity. It is cut at the vernal %0a%3c equinox, when the flower is just going off; a child or an old %0a%3c woman is able to do this, and their labour may be had at a %0a%3c trifling rate. It is of a white appearance, and if one would %0a%3c wish to express briefly what it looks like, it is a trifoliated %0a%3c ehrub,^- with small, narrow leaves. It is always given' to %0a%3c animals at intervals of a couple of days, and in winter, when it is %0a%3c dry, before being given to them, it is first moistened with water. %0a%3c Ten pounds of cytisus will suffice for a horse, and for smaller %0a%3c animals in proportion : if I may here mention it by the way, %0a%3c it is found veiy profitable to sow garlic and onions between %0a%3c the rows of cytisus. %0a%3c %0a%3c This shrub has been found in the Isle of Cythnus, from %0a%3c whence it has been transplanted to all the Cyclades, and more %0a%3c recently to the cities of Greece, a fact which has greatly in- %0a%3c creased the supply of cheese : considering which, I am much %0a%3c surprised that it is so rarely used in Italy. This shrub is proof, %0a%3c too, against all injuries from heat, from cold, from hail, and %0a%3c from snow : and, as Hyginus adds, against the depredations of %0a%3c the enemy even, the wood^^ produced being of no value what- %0a%3c ever. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 48.
