September 21, 2021, at 04:38 AM by ?: [=Outernet operates within the traditional internet just like cryptocurrency does.  The design is composed of three types of users.  Hosts, clients, and keymasters.  The host hosts the encrypted content.  Clients either view the content or upload it.  Keymasters decrypt the content.  Every user is known by a public key.  Instead of clients knowing the IP address they want to connect to, instead they broadcast what they are looking for, either a public key of the host or even a query they are searching for.  If a keymaster knows they have a decryption key for said website, they will offer the content to that user.  Then the keymaster will send along the decryption key to another keymaster and the new keymaster will listen for new requests.  Also the new keymaster sends a new OP address (which is a public key itself) to the public key of the web host as that new key is what they keymaster will sign for.  One very important thing here is the host should not be able to search for their public key and have a keymaster decrypt their site.  That would allow for censorship if the host could see what he was hosting.  So the only one who should know what a hosts public address is hosting should be the current keymaster for the site and the clients, host, or even other keymasters (even ones that have decrypted the site in the past) should not be able to link content to which host it is on. =]%0a* [[NatureVault/Poisoning]]  . . .

However about the fastest a PoW blockchain can provide timestamps currently is 15 seconds.  In the best case scenario this can never be much faster than 1.5 seconds (tick rate) since the speed of light is 0.15 seconds and a blockchain needs 10 times that relay time in order to work on a PoW solution to maintain under a roughly 10%25 orphan rate.  With PoHW, we broadcast all work done, as it is done, not just the solution to a block.  This allows for our minimum tick rate to be around the ping of the network itself, around 200ms currently.
