My version would be a wet paste of (equal weights to begin) wood ash, salt, and purified clay powder would be mixed with some water to form a paste, and pasted on the wood surfaces to fossilize, then putting it in plastic to prevent drying.  Let sit in this state for a week (or more?) then remove plastic and allow to slowly dry.  When fully dry remove the dirt and you should be left with surface fossilized wood. =]%0a* [[NatureVault/Actionlattice]]  . . . @@** 1 May 2023 12:15 UTC**@@ by ?: [=(:Redirect CryptoProjects/Actionlattice:) =]%0a* [[NatureVault/Pedophilia]]  . . . @@** 1 May 2023 12:07 UTC**@@ by ?: [=Epstein probably an undercpver [[blackmail]] operative [[https://beckernews.com/epstein-a-spy-newly-revealed-meetings-with-biden-cia-director-fuel-belief-he-was-blackmail-operative-50164/|#]] which means his death likely faked and he is living in alcapulco or something with a new name and face. =]%0a* [[NatureVault/Bioweapon]]  . . . @@**30 Apr 2023 21:14 UTC**@@ by ?: [=!![[Fauci]] / [[Pasteur]] [[#fauci]] =]%0a* [[NatureVault/Thunderbird]]  . . . @@**30 Apr 2023 17:35 UTC**@@ by ?: [=Thunderbird physics [[https://www.universeofsymbolism.com/thunderbird-symbolism.html|#]] seems a lot like [[bigfoot]] who uses plasma to control the weather  Griffon vulture [[https://twitter.com/buitengebieden/status/1652626635558903808|#]] =]%0a* [[NatureVault/Acetobacter]]  . . . @@**30 Apr 2023 16:58 UTC**@@ by ?: [=found in [[bee]] [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetobacter_aceti|#]]  A split off genus Gluconacetobacter can produce [[cellulose]] and is in [[kombucha]] [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluconacetobacter_xylinus|#]] =]%0a* [[NatureVault/ForestGarden]]  . . . @@**29 Apr 2023 08:12 UTC**@@ by ?: [= Tree planting prep [[https://www.brighteon.com/9e9c6b01-395d-44ff-bc38-0d80782b09bc|#]] =]%0a* [[NatureVault/Constipation]]  . . . @@**29 Apr 2023 07:02 UTC**@@ by ?: [= [[Milk thistle]] seeds may help along with potentially [[bull thistle]] by increasing [[bile]] production [[https://food.ndtv.com/health/7-amazing-benefits-of-milk-thistle-for-strong-immunity-better-digestion-1664534|#]] =]%0a* [[NatureVault/HighCholesterol]]  . . . @@**28 Apr 2023 21:53 UTC**@@ by ?: [=Elevated blood cholesterol possibly caused by [[mycobacterium]] infection.
