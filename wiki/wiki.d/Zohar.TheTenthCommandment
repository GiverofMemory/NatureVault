text=The Tenth Commandment %0a%0a%0a%0a237. The tenth Mitzva obliges man to put on Tefillin and to attain the Supernal %0aproperties, as it is written, THE CREATOR CREATED MAN IN HIS OWN %0aIMAGE. He opened and said, "Your head upon you is like the Carmel." This %0atext refers to the Supernal head— the Tefillin worn on the head of the Holy, %0aSupernal King HdVaYaH, written in separate letters. Each letter in the holy %0aname HdVaYaH corresponds to a certain paragraph in the Tefillin. Thus, the %0aHoly, Supernal Name is written in the scrolls of Tefillin, in the secrets of the %0aletters. For THE NAME OF THE CREATOR IS UPON YOU, AND THEY %0aSHALL BE AFRAID OF YOU refers to the head Tefillin, which contains the %0aHoly Name HaVaYaH. %0a%0aBy being merciful to the poor, one merely begins to receive the Creator's %0aSupernal image. Bina absorbs the properties of Malchut, described by the verse, %0aLET US CREATE MAN IN OUR IMAGE, AFTER OUR LIKENESS. By %0aunifying Bina's properties with those of Malchut, AHP de Bina (the letters ELEH) %0afell to ZON, and only the letters MI (GE) remained in Ima. AHP de Bina that %0afell to ZON consist of Aba and Ima: Aba assumes the properties of ZA, and Ima %0aassumes the properties of Nukva. %0a%0aSince AVI descended to the place of ZON, they became like ZON. And from %0athem ZON receive the state of Katnut, called TZELEM Elokim, likeness to Bina %0a(VAK), for Ima lost the GAR of her own state, that is, since her AHP fell to ZON, %0ashe lost the Light of GAR (see diagram on next page). %0a%0aTherefore, only the letters MI = GE = K-H remained in Ima, whereas her %0aB-ZA-M = AHP = ELEH fell to ZON. Thus, of the five Lights NRNHY that were %0ainside Ima, she retained only Ohr Ruach in Keter and Ohr Ne/esh in Hochma. %0aThus, Ima can only give ZON the Light of VAK = Ruach + Nefesh, but not the %0aLight of GAR = NRNHY. Also, ZON are considered to have acquired likeness to %0a%0a433 %0a%0a%0a%0a434 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0athe Upper One only upon receiving the Lights NRNHY. And this is achieved by %0athe fulfillment of the Mitzva of Tefillin. %0a%0a%0a%0aLight of %0aBina %0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0aYechida %0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0aPartzuf %0aBina %0a%0a%0aChaya %0aNeshama %0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0aKeter %0a%0a%0aRuach %0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0aPartzuf %0aMalchut %0a%0a%0aHochma %0a%0a%0aNefesh %0a%0a%0a%3c %0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0aBina %0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0aKeter %0a%0a%0aZA %0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0aHochma %0a%0a%0aMalchut %0a%0a%0aParsa of the World of Atzilut %0a%0a%0a%0a%0aBina %0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0aZA %0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0aMalchut %0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0aYet, a question arises: we have already learned that to create the Partzuf of %0alower man out of ZON, ZON must ascend to AVI and receive the Light of GAR, %0afor a small Partzuf without Ohr Hochma cannot beget. So why is it said that Ima %0ais in a state of Katnutl %0a%0aWhen ZON attain reception of the Light of AVI, they thereby ascend to AVI %0aand become similar to AVI in their properties, for each lower one that ascends %0ato the Upper One becomes like it. Indeed, only the magnitude of the screen %0adistinguishes between spiritual objects, as only the magnitude of the screen %0adetermines all of the object's properties. %0a%0aThus, upon ascending and clothing AVI, ZON become like AVI, and all the %0aproperties of AVI are now naturally adopted by ZON. Just as AVI create ZON, %0aZON in AVI beget and pass the Light into the Partzuf of lower man. Hence, there %0ais no need to even change names, for everything occurs at the degree of AVI. %0aAnd upon ascending there, ZON are already called AVI, and the Light that they %0apass to man is regarded as the Light intended for ZON. %0a%0aIt is written: THE CREATOR CREATED MAN IN HIS OWN IMAGE. %0aThe Hebrew word "image" that is used in the Torah is T?eLeM, and is formed by %0athree letters: Tzadi-Lamed-Mem. In item 2, we said that there are no Kelim for Ohr %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Tenth Commandment %0a%0a%0a%0a435 %0a%0a%0a%0aHaya and Yechida; rather, there are only Kelirn Bina-ZA-Malchut for the Lights %0aNRN: 'Nefesh-Ruach-Neshama. %0a%0aSo even when we say that there is a Kli called Keter, we imply that the %0acount starts with Bina de Keter, not with Keter de Keter. Bina and ZON, the %0aKelim that remained in the Partzuf, are divided into three lines: the line of %0aBina—HBD, the line of ZA-HGT, and the line of Malchut— NHYM. This is %0acharacteristic of Ohr Hassadim. %0a%0aBina - Hochma %0a%0aDaat Bina %0a%0aGevura - Hesed %0a%0aTifferet ZA %0a%0aHod - Netzah %0a%0aYesod %0a%0aMalchut Malchut %0a%0aHowever, when Ohr Hochma is transferred, Partzuf Bina divides into two %0aPartzufim: AVI and YESHSUT. These constitute HBD = three and HGT = three. %0aAlong with ZAT = seven Sefirot, from Hesed to Malchut, and form the Gematria %0aof thirteen (3 + 3 + 7) of the word Echad, which alludes to the complete name, %0astate, and attainment. %0a%0aThe thing is that Sefirot Keter and Hochma are concealed in AA, and only its %0aSefira Bina sends her Light down. This Sefira Bina de AA is divided into two Partzufim, %0aAVI and YESHSUT: her GAR shines in AVI and her ZAT shines in YESHSUT %0aThese two parts of Bina are called M (Mem) and L (Lamed) of the word T^eLeM: %0a%0a1. AVI are called M of the word TzeLeM, as they form a closed ring %0aguarding Ohr Hochma, preventing it from reaching the other, lower %0aPartzufim. This Ohr Hochma is referred to as "concealed" (from all the %0aPartzufim of the world of Atzilut), and only Ohr Hassadim, Ohr Ruach, %0adescends from them to all the Partzufim of the world of Atzilut during %0athe 6,000 years until the end of correction. %0a%0a2. YESHSUT is called L of the word TzeLeM, as it bows its head (GAR) %0aand resembles a tower. It is written about this tower: "The Tower of %0aOz (strength) of the Creator's name." This is because YESHSUT is %0a%0a%0a%0a436 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0acalled a "tower," and ZA is known as the "righteous one." After all, %0aYESHSUT is ZAT de Bina, the properties of ZON that are included in %0aBina; hence, it passes its Ohr Hochma to ZON. %0a%0aIf ZON in Katnut are filled with Ohr Hassadim (Ruach called Avir— air), then %0aduring the reception of Ohr Hochma from YESHSUT, the letter Yod in the word %0aAvir exits, and Avir turns into Ohr (Light). Hence, YESHSUT is called a "tower," %0ai.e., a Partzuf in Gadlut that contains Hochma, soaring in the air (Avir). %0a%0aHowever, this state in ZON is inconstant. YESHSUT intermittently returns %0ato Katnut and to Gadlut; therefore, such a state is called "soaring." ZA is called %0aTz (Tzadi) of the word T^eLeM, for such is his property inside this tower. Thus: %0a%0a- AVI— M (Mem)— Hochma that is concealed inside a ring. %0a%0a- YESHSUT— L (Lamed)— Bina, though as she ascends to AA, she becomes %0aHochma (tower) and passes Ohr Hochma down. %0a%0a- ZON— Tz (Tzadi)— Daat, receives the Light from YESHSUT. %0a%0aHowever, one should not confuse the three letters Tz-L-M with the three %0alines called HBD: T^eLeM consists of three Partzufim, one inside the other. %0aPartzuf Hochma (M of the TzeLeM, AVI) is the innermost Partzuf; Partzuf Bina %0a(YESHSUT, L of the TzeLeM) clothes it from Chazeh de AVI downward; and %0afrom Chazeh de YESHSUT downwards, Partzuf Bina is clothed by Partzuf Daat, %0aZA, Tz of the word TzeLeM. %0a%0aThe words, THE CREATOR CREATED MAN IN HIS OWN IMAGE %0a(TzeLeM), mean that with the help of the spiritual observance of the Mitzva of %0aTefillin, Ohr Hochma is received in accordance with the ascending order of the %0aletters Tz-L-M. This is the Light that Adam received after his creation, whereas we %0afirst stimulate the reception of this Light in ZON, and from ZON we stimulate %0aits reception into ourselves. %0a%0aTHE HEAD TEFILLIN CONTAINS THE NAME OF THE HOLY KING, %0aINSCRIBED IN THE LETTERS HaVaYaH-the head Tefillin is the name of %0athe Supernal King, inscribed in the letters HaVaYaH. The Tefillin are called the %0aCarmel (Car Maleh-all goodness), as it is written: YOUR HEAD UPON YOU %0aIS LIKE THE CARMEL. This is because when the heads of ZA and Malchut put %0aon the head Tefillin (the Upper Light of TzeLeM), they become like the Carmel %0a(Car Maleh— all goodness). %0a%0aThis Light is called "The name of the Supernal, Holy King," the four %0aletters of HaVaYaH, where each letter is written separately: Yod-Hey-Vav-Hey . %0aAnd the reason why man feels that the letters are written separately is that each %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Tenth Commandment %0a%0a%0a%0a437 %0a%0a%0a%0aPartzuf contains the four letters of HaVaYaH, and each of them designates an %0aindependent Partzuf. %0a%0aEvery letter constitutes a separate passage on the parchment (in the %0aTefillin); four separate passages correspond to the four letters of HaVaYaH. A %0apassage (Hebrew— Parashah) represents a separate and complete Partzuf, and its %0acorresponding letter in HaVaYaH symbolizes the Light in this Partzuf. The order %0aof Partzufim corresponds to the order of the letters of HaVaYaH: Yod-Hey-Vav- %0aHey. Such a Tefillin is called the Tefillin of Rashi. %0a%0aHowever, there is a Tefillin with the order of passages (Partzufim) Yod-Hey- %0aHey-Vav, called Tefillin Rabeinu Tarn. The passages that are written on fragments %0aof parchment are identical, but the order of putting them into the boxes of %0aTefillin Rabeinu Tarn is different: Yod-Hey-Hey-Vav. %0a%0a238. The first passage in the Tefillin corresponds to the letter Yod of the %0aname HaVaYaH (Hochma) and refers to the Mitzva, "Sanctify to Me all the %0afirstborn." This is because Hochma is the firstborn of all the Supernal Ones. %0aIt opens the place of conception for the future firstborn with the help of %0aa thin line of Light that emanates from Yod, which opens the womb and %0aimpregnates it. %0a%0aAVI are designated by the letter Yod of the name HaVaYaH, where Yod %0asignifies Aba and the filling of Yod (according to its pronunciation: Yod = Yod + %0aVav + Dalet), i.e., Vav + Dalet constitutes lma. Partzuf AVI is called "holy" and %0a"first born," for Partzufim YESHSUT and ZON are called holy only when they %0areceive holiness (Ohr Hochma) from AVI. All the holiness in the world of Atzilut %0acomes from AVI. %0a%0aThis is so because Ohr Hochma is called "holiness" and AVI is Mem of the %0aword T^eLeM (Hochma de Atzilut), for the Supernal Hochma of the world of Atzilut %0ais concealed within them. AVI themselves are defined as Bina in the property %0aof Hassadim, as Hochma is concealed within Rosh de AA, and the lower ones can %0areceive it only if Bina ascends to Hochma, to Rosh de AA, where Bina unites with %0aHochma of Rosh de AA and assumes the name Hochma. However, she is not the %0aordinary Hochma; she is called "Hochma of the thirty-two paths" of descending %0aOhr Hochma, and only this Hochma bestows Ohr Hochma upon all the Partzufim %0aof the world of Atzilut. %0a%0aThis is why The Zohar says that this thin ray of Light, called the "path of %0aLight," opens the womb and conceives the future offspring. Yod consists of three %0aparts: (i) the upper "spike" of the letter Yod, a small line above the point, which %0ais called Rosh and designates Partzuf AA that is concealed in AVI; (ii) the body of %0a%0a%0a%0a438 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0athe Yod, which forms PartzufAVl; and (iii) the lower "spike" of the letter, which %0adesignates Yesod, the end of Partzuf AVI. %0a%0aThrough the continuous Zivug between Yesod de Aba and Yesod de Ima, the %0agreat waters descend onto all the lower worlds with all that inhabits them. This %0aZivug on Ohr Hassadim is called a "Zivug that revives the worlds." Yesod de Ima %0ais also called Rechem (womb), for all Rachamim (mercy) stems from this part of %0aIts Partzuf. Yet, if AVI do not make a Zivug, this part of Ima is closed, and mercy %0adoes not descend below. Only Yesod de Aba can open Yesod de Ima, whereupon %0aIma passes her great waters to the lower ones. %0a%0a239. The second passage in the Tefillin, WHEN YOU COME, corresponds %0ato the first letter Hey of the name HaVaYaH, the hall (Bind) that opens up %0aunder the influence of the letter Yod (Aba) in fifty entrances, passages, and %0achambers concealed within it. The revelation that Yod made in that hall was %0adone so as to hear the voice of the Shofar (a ram's horn), Bind. The Shofar %0ais closed on all sides, but the letter Yod came and opened it so that its sound %0acould be heard. And since it opened the Shofar and derived sound from it, %0aYod led all to freedom. %0a%0aThe letter Hey of the name HaVaYaH is YESHSUT, L in the word TzeLeM. It %0ais called a "tower soaring in the air," a hall with fifty entrances, for the concealed %0aAVI are designated by the M of TzeLeM, by the ring that surrounds Ohr Hochma %0aand prevents it from shining outside. And they shine only with Ohr Hassadim. %0a%0aHowever, by rising to Rosh de AA, where Bina turns into Hochma, YESHSUT %0acan pass Ohr Hochma to ZON. Bina, who turns into Hochma in order to receive %0aHochma for ZON, is called the "fifty gates of Bina," for she consists of five Sefirot %0aKHB-ZA-M, ten in each. Each of these fifty Sefirot consists of a chamber and %0aan entrance: HGT are called a "chamber" and NHY are called an "entrance," %0aa "passage," implying the absence of a Kli for reception. Instead, it serves for %0atransferring the Light into, or out of the chamber. %0a%0aTherefore, the second passage used in the Tefillin: AND WHEN YOU %0aCOME designates the letter Hey in the name HaVaYaH, YESHSUT of the world %0aof Atzilut, which ascends to accept Ohr Hochma and pass it on to ZON below. %0a%0aYod opened this hall so as to hear the voice that comes from the ram's horn, %0afor this horn is closed on all sides. As was already mentioned, YESHSUT (Bina) %0aunited with Malchut by lowering her three Sefirot ELEH (Bina and ZON) to %0aZON, while YESHSUT remained with only two Sefirot KH, MI. %0a%0aThen, as a result of raising MAN, Malchut descends from the Eynaim (eyes), the %0aEynaim of YESHSUT open up, Malchut descends to her own place in the Peh, and %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Tenth Commandment %0a%0a%0a%0a439 %0a%0a%0a%0athe three letters ELEH reunite with MI to form the name ELOKIM. GE = KH de %0aZON ascend to Bina along with these ELEH. However, although ELEH ascended %0aand joined MI, the name ELOKIM is still considered closed, for it has only Ohr %0aHochma, and Ohr Hochma cannot shine in ELEH without Ohr Hassadim. %0a%0aThese three letters ELEH are therefore defined as a horn (Shofar), and ZON %0athat ascended to Bina along with ELEH are concealed within them. And these %0aZON in ELEH are referred to as a "voice." This voice sounds in the hall with the %0ahelp of the letter Yod, for Yod designates AVI that bestow the Light from Above, %0awhich facilitates the lowering of Malchut from Nikvey Eynaim de YESHSUT to %0aher place in the Peh, and raising ELEH back to Bina. Hence, Yod opens up the %0ahall of Light in YESHSUT in order to pass this Light to ZON from the Shofar %0a(the ascended letters ELEH). %0a%0aZON, too, ascend to Bina along with ELEH and there receive Hochma. This %0agreat Light in ZA is called a "voice," and its reception is known as "listening to %0athe voice." However, this horn is closed on all sides, on the sides of Hochma and %0aHassadim, for the letters ELEH (called a "horn") fall to ZON, where they remain %0aclosed and inaccessible both to Ohr Hochma and to Ohr Hassadim. %0a%0aConsequently, two corrections are needed: (i) to elevate and unite them %0awith Bina, enabling them to once more attain their Ohr Hochma; (ii) to provide %0athem with Ohr Hassadim so it can serve as a garment for Ohr Hochma. %0a%0aFirst, Yod (AVI) pass the Light to Hey (YESHSUT), whereupon ELEH rise %0aabove Malchut, to Bina, together with ZON, and there receive Ohr Hochma. %0aHowever, this Ohr Hochma is called concealed or closed, for it cannot shine %0awithout being clothed in Ohr Hassadim. This means that the voice has not yet %0aemerged— ZA has not yet been born. %0a%0aAfter that, Yod enters into the word Light = Ohr; hence, it turns into Avir %0a= air (Ohr Hassadim). And since the horn (the letters ELEH) received air (Ohr %0aHassadim), they can beget ZA (the voice of the Shofar), for being clothed in Ohr %0aHassadim, Ohr Hochma can enter ZA. %0a%0aThe general Light that ZA receives is called "voice." And this voice frees %0aall the slaves that were enslaved by the egoistic desires in all the worlds, for ZA %0ashines down on all the lower ones. Thus, the sons of Israel (man's spiritual %0aaspirations) merit the Light of deliverance (defeat the earthly, egoistic ones). %0a%0a240. At the sounds of the Shofar, the sons of Israel were delivered from Egypt. %0aAnd so shall the Shofar be blown in the future, the next time at the end of %0adays. And all deliverance originates from this Shofar, which is Bina. This is %0awhy the deliverance from Egypt is mentioned in this chapter of the Torah, for %0a%0a%0a%0a440 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0athis Shofar stems from the force of the letter Yod, which opens the womb and %0adelivers the captives to freedom. And this is the letter Hey, the second letter %0aof the name HaVaYaH. %0a%0aAll of the Light in ZON comes from the horn (ELEH), including the great %0aLight that delivers Israel from Egypt, and the Light that is destined to be revealed %0ain the future, at the end of days (complete deliverance from egoism). This is why %0athe Tefillin contain a passage that refers to the exodus from Egypt, for the Light %0adelivering from Egypt comes from the horn, which is inside YESHSUT. This is %0adone by the power of AVI, called Yod de HaVaYaH, which open the womb of %0aYESHSUT (ELEH) and free the voice (ZA) from its captivity. %0a%0aThis Light has sufficient power to deliver Israel from slavery. Only after the %0aattainment of this Light (Ohr Haya), and not a degree lower, can ZA and Nukva %0abe called "voice" and "speech." All deliverance comes only from Ohr Haya (only %0aupon ascending the spiritual degree of Ohr Haya can man liberate himself from %0aegoism and become free). %0a%0a241. The third passage in the Tefillin is the secret of the Unity in "Hear O %0aIsrael," the letter Vav in HaVaYaH, which includes all and designates ZA, %0awho contains the unity of all. Everything merges in unity within him, and %0ahe receives all. The fourth passage that reads, "You shall hear," includes two %0asides, Hesed and Qevura, which unite with the Assembly of Israel, called %0athe lower Qevura or Malchut. And this is the last letter Hey of the name %0aHaVaYaH, which takes and includes them all. %0a%0aThe third passage in the Tefillin (Hear O Israel) is Partzuf ZA, the letter Vav %0ain HaVaYaH, which includes all four passages contained in the Tefillin. Although %0athe first two passages (AVI and YESHSUT) represent Hochma and Bina, they do %0anot really constitute Hochma and Bina themselves, but rather, their part, which %0aclothes in Rosh de ZON, called M and L of TZeLeM de ZA. %0a%0aSimilarly, the fourth passage, Malchut of ZA, does not imply that this is %0aMalchut herself. Rather, it refers to her part that is included in ZA and is called %0aMochin (brain) de Gevura. There are three parts of Mochin in ZA: Hochma, Bina, %0aand Daat, which are accordingly called M, L and Tz of T^eLeM de ZA. They are %0athe same HB-ZA-M as in Mochin de ZA. This is because Daat (Tz) includes Hesed %0aand Gevura. And this Hesed in Daat is defined as ZA himself, and Gevura is %0adefined as the inclusion (of the properties) of Nukva in ZA. And these H-B-ZA-M %0aconstitute the four passages contained in the Tefillin. %0a%0aThis is why ZA, the letter Vav in the name HaVaYaH, includes all four %0apassages. And all the unions that come from AVI and YESHSUT are done within %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Tenth Commandment %0a%0a%0a%0a441 %0a%0a%0a%0ahim, i.e., for his sake. For all the Higher Partzufim that precede ZA are united %0a(with the Creator), and need no MAN from the lower ones to reach the state of %0aunity. Whereas all the MAN raised by the lower ones to the Upper Partzufim are %0ameant solely for the unification of ZA, and in no way affect the constant unity %0aof the Higher Partzufim with the Creator. %0a%0aThe unification of Hochma with Bina, as a result of which Bina becomes %0alike Hochma, occurs only on account of ZA being raised to Bina in the form of %0aMAN. For when ZA is raised to Bina as MAN, Bina ascends to Rosh de AA and %0athere receives Hochma for ZA. Since Bina aspires only to mercy (Ohr Hassadim), %0ashe never receives Ohr Hochma for the Creator's sake, but only if the lower ones %0aare in need of it. Her role, her properties are only to bestow, and not to receive. %0a(Note that in the spiritual, "reception" is always for the Creator's sake.) %0a%0aHence, Bina ascends to Rosh de AA only for the sake of ZON. And it is ZA %0aalone that ascends to Bina and stimulates her to ascend to Rosh de AA, where she %0amakes a Zivug with Hochma and passes this Light to him. It is therefore said that %0aZA receives all, as Bina passes everything that she receives in Rosh de AA to him. %0aAnd Ohr Hochma is revealed only in the place of ZA (not Bina), as he descends %0aback to his place below Chazeh de ZA. %0a%0aThe prayer "Hear O Israel" designates ZA, the letter Vav of the name %0aHaVaYaH, the Supernal unity (item 207) that reveals love only from the good %0aside. And since it refers only to "Love your Creator...," it contains no restrictions %0aor strictness of judgment. %0a%0aHowever, in the fourth passage, "You shall hear," the last Hey of the name %0aHaVaYaH, Nukva de ZA that is included in him, Gevura in Rosh de ZA, reveals %0aboth sides of love— good, as well as evil (item 206), reflected in the words of this %0apassage. It ends with the words: "Blessed be His great name for ever and ever," %0awhich corresponds to the inclusion and unity of Nukva in ZA, meaning not %0aNukt/a herself, but her part in ZA, i.e., Mochin de Daat. %0a%0aGevura in Daat is the second Hey in HaVaYaH. It accepts all the Light of %0athe Supernal unity contained in "Hear O Israel," and includes all. And since it %0acontains all the perfection of unity, it reveals all the Light and both sides of love, %0afor the property of judgment that complements love to perfection exists only %0awithin it, and not Above. %0a%0aIt is therefore written: "Your head upon you is like the Carmel, " des ignating %0athe head Tefillin. Indeed, after ZA is clothed in all four Lights, designated by %0athe four paragraphs of the Tefillin, which are the three letters Tz, L, and M of %0a%0a%0a%0a442 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0athe word T^eLeM, his head is defined as the Carmel (Car Maleh— completely %0afilled with goodness). %0a%0a242. Tefillin are the letters of the holy name. Therefore, "Your head upon %0ayou is like the Carmel" refers to the head Tefillin. The letter Dcdet refers to %0athe hand Tefillin, Malchut, who is depleted of Light, compared to the head %0aTefillin, ZA, but she contains the perfection of the Upper One. %0a%0aThe hand Tefillin designates Malchut. And she is poor in comparison with %0aBina, the Upper World. Yet, she has her own perfection, for she now receives it %0afrom Bina thanks to the unity between Nukva and ZA in "Blessed be His great %0aname for ever and ever." %0a%0aAnd since she is not the Nukva that is included in ZA (his body), but a %0aseparate Nukva of ZA, she takes all four passages from him, H-B-ZA-M of ZA, for %0ashe has a separate, complete Partzuf. However, these four passages of the Torah %0aare in the same place; they are not separated from each other by partitions, as %0ain the Tefillin of ZA. %0a%0aThe reason for this is that a passage of the Torah is the Light, and the place %0awhere it dwells is a Kli (the Tefillin in our world is a box made of a "pure" animal's %0askin, into which four parchment scrolls are placed, and the corresponding %0apassages from the Torah are written on each). As we know, every Zivug emanates %0aLight. Since ZA receives four Lights H-B-H-G in four Kelim, as a result of four %0aZivugim, he contains four compartments for four passages, each compartment %0acontaining a particular passage from the Torah. %0a%0aHowever, no Zivug is made on Malchut herself. Everything that Malchut has, %0ashe receives from ZA. Malchut receives all four Lights (four passages from the %0aTorah that result from one Zivug with ZA); hence, she has only one place for all %0afour passages (Lights). %0a%0a243. "The King is held captive in the tubs" means that he is tied down and held %0ain those four compartments of the Tefillin for the purpose of being properly %0aunited with that holy name. And he who makes this correction, exists in image %0aand likeness, TZELEM, with the Creator. Just as the holy name is united in %0athe Creator, the holy name is united in him. "Male and female he created %0athem" refers to the head and the hand Tefillin. And it is one. %0a%0a"The King is held captive in the tubs" signifies ZA, who is bound and %0aunified in those compartments of the Tefillin. The compartments of the Tefillin, %0awhich contain the passages from the Torah, are called "tubs" or "troughs," just %0alike the tubs from which sheep drink water, for the waters of Ohr Hochma and %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Tenth Commandment %0a%0a%0a%0a443 %0a%0a%0a%0aOhr Hassadim are bound and restricted by these Kelim, the compartments of the %0aTefillin. And it is the Creator who is bound tight and held in these Kelim, so as %0ato be unified in the holy name. %0a%0aThe compartments of the Tefillin are the TNHY of Tvuna, the lower part of %0aYESHSUT (Israel-Saba and Tvuna, where Israel-Saba is the male part and Tvuna %0ais the female). This part of Tvuna is called the big letter Dalet of the word Echad %0a(one) in the verse, "Hear O Israel, our Creator is one." It is written about this %0aletter: "Let the dry land appear." %0a%0aAs was already mentioned in the third Mitzva, because this "dry land" was %0arevealed in ZA, he can pass the Light to Malchut. Thus, were it not for these four %0aplaces in ZA, the dry land within him, he would have been unable to give the %0aLight to Nukva. Hence, it is said that ZA "is tied down and held in those places" %0athat stem from dry land so as to enable him to unite and pass the revelation of %0athe Creator's Light into the holy name, Nukva. As a result, the dry land becomes %0afertile and produces fruit. %0a%0aTherefore, he who has completed the corrections of these four passages %0afrom the Torah acquires the image and likeness (T^eLeM) of the Creator. In %0aother words, when man "below" (below the world of Atzilut, in the worlds BYA) %0a"puts on" the Tefillin (attains the level of this degree), he receives the Light of H- %0aB-H-G from ZA. This Light is called TzeLeM, since Hochma and Bina are called M %0aand L, whereas Hesed and Gevura are called Tz. And just like Elokim, Bina unites %0awith the holy name of Malchut, thereby uniting the holy name within man, for %0aman is a part of Malchut. %0a%0aThere are two parts— male and female— in the Light of Hochma and Bina %0a(called TzeLeM): TzeLeM of ZA and TzeLeM of Nukva, the head Tefillin and the %0ahand Tefillin. Hence, it is said that the Creator created a man and a woman, %0areferring to the head Tefillin and the hand Tefillin.

diff:1688309475:1688309475:=1,665d0%0a%3c The Tenth Commandment %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 237. The tenth Mitzva obliges man to put on Tefillin and to attain the Supernal %0a%3c properties, as it is written, THE CREATOR CREATED MAN IN HIS OWN %0a%3c IMAGE. He opened and said, "Your head upon you is like the Carmel." This %0a%3c text refers to the Supernal head— the Tefillin worn on the head of the Holy, %0a%3c Supernal King HdVaYaH, written in separate letters. Each letter in the holy %0a%3c name HdVaYaH corresponds to a certain paragraph in the Tefillin. Thus, the %0a%3c Holy, Supernal Name is written in the scrolls of Tefillin, in the secrets of the %0a%3c letters. For THE NAME OF THE CREATOR IS UPON YOU, AND THEY %0a%3c SHALL BE AFRAID OF YOU refers to the head Tefillin, which contains the %0a%3c Holy Name HaVaYaH. %0a%3c %0a%3c By being merciful to the poor, one merely begins to receive the Creator's %0a%3c Supernal image. Bina absorbs the properties of Malchut, described by the verse, %0a%3c LET US CREATE MAN IN OUR IMAGE, AFTER OUR LIKENESS. By %0a%3c unifying Bina's properties with those of Malchut, AHP de Bina (the letters ELEH) %0a%3c fell to ZON, and only the letters MI (GE) remained in Ima. AHP de Bina that %0a%3c fell to ZON consist of Aba and Ima: Aba assumes the properties of ZA, and Ima %0a%3c assumes the properties of Nukva. %0a%3c %0a%3c Since AVI descended to the place of ZON, they became like ZON. And from %0a%3c them ZON receive the state of Katnut, called TZELEM Elokim, likeness to Bina %0a%3c (VAK), for Ima lost the GAR of her own state, that is, since her AHP fell to ZON, %0a%3c she lost the Light of GAR (see diagram on next page). %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, only the letters MI = GE = K-H remained in Ima, whereas her %0a%3c B-ZA-M = AHP = ELEH fell to ZON. Thus, of the five Lights NRNHY that were %0a%3c inside Ima, she retained only Ohr Ruach in Keter and Ohr Ne/esh in Hochma. %0a%3c Thus, Ima can only give ZON the Light of VAK = Ruach + Nefesh, but not the %0a%3c Light of GAR = NRNHY. Also, ZON are considered to have acquired likeness to %0a%3c %0a%3c 433 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 434 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c the Upper One only upon receiving the Lights NRNHY. And this is achieved by %0a%3c the fulfillment of the Mitzva of Tefillin. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Light of %0a%3c Bina %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Yechida %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Partzuf %0a%3c Bina %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chaya %0a%3c Neshama %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Keter %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Ruach %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Partzuf %0a%3c Malchut %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Hochma %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Nefesh %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Bina %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Keter %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ZA %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Hochma %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Parsa of the World of Atzilut %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Bina %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ZA %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Yet, a question arises: we have already learned that to create the Partzuf of %0a%3c lower man out of ZON, ZON must ascend to AVI and receive the Light of GAR, %0a%3c for a small Partzuf without Ohr Hochma cannot beget. So why is it said that Ima %0a%3c is in a state of Katnutl %0a%3c %0a%3c When ZON attain reception of the Light of AVI, they thereby ascend to AVI %0a%3c and become similar to AVI in their properties, for each lower one that ascends %0a%3c to the Upper One becomes like it. Indeed, only the magnitude of the screen %0a%3c distinguishes between spiritual objects, as only the magnitude of the screen %0a%3c determines all of the object's properties. %0a%3c %0a%3c Thus, upon ascending and clothing AVI, ZON become like AVI, and all the %0a%3c properties of AVI are now naturally adopted by ZON. Just as AVI create ZON, %0a%3c ZON in AVI beget and pass the Light into the Partzuf of lower man. Hence, there %0a%3c is no need to even change names, for everything occurs at the degree of AVI. %0a%3c And upon ascending there, ZON are already called AVI, and the Light that they %0a%3c pass to man is regarded as the Light intended for ZON. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is written: THE CREATOR CREATED MAN IN HIS OWN IMAGE. %0a%3c The Hebrew word "image" that is used in the Torah is T?eLeM, and is formed by %0a%3c three letters: Tzadi-Lamed-Mem. In item 2, we said that there are no Kelim for Ohr %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Tenth Commandment %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 435 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Haya and Yechida; rather, there are only Kelirn Bina-ZA-Malchut for the Lights %0a%3c NRN: 'Nefesh-Ruach-Neshama. %0a%3c %0a%3c So even when we say that there is a Kli called Keter, we imply that the %0a%3c count starts with Bina de Keter, not with Keter de Keter. Bina and ZON, the %0a%3c Kelim that remained in the Partzuf, are divided into three lines: the line of %0a%3c Bina—HBD, the line of ZA-HGT, and the line of Malchut— NHYM. This is %0a%3c characteristic of Ohr Hassadim. %0a%3c %0a%3c Bina - Hochma %0a%3c %0a%3c Daat Bina %0a%3c %0a%3c Gevura - Hesed %0a%3c %0a%3c Tifferet ZA %0a%3c %0a%3c Hod - Netzah %0a%3c %0a%3c Yesod %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut Malchut %0a%3c %0a%3c However, when Ohr Hochma is transferred, Partzuf Bina divides into two %0a%3c Partzufim: AVI and YESHSUT. These constitute HBD = three and HGT = three. %0a%3c Along with ZAT = seven Sefirot, from Hesed to Malchut, and form the Gematria %0a%3c of thirteen (3 + 3 + 7) of the word Echad, which alludes to the complete name, %0a%3c state, and attainment. %0a%3c %0a%3c The thing is that Sefirot Keter and Hochma are concealed in AA, and only its %0a%3c Sefira Bina sends her Light down. This Sefira Bina de AA is divided into two Partzufim, %0a%3c AVI and YESHSUT: her GAR shines in AVI and her ZAT shines in YESHSUT %0a%3c These two parts of Bina are called M (Mem) and L (Lamed) of the word T^eLeM: %0a%3c %0a%3c 1. AVI are called M of the word TzeLeM, as they form a closed ring %0a%3c guarding Ohr Hochma, preventing it from reaching the other, lower %0a%3c Partzufim. This Ohr Hochma is referred to as "concealed" (from all the %0a%3c Partzufim of the world of Atzilut), and only Ohr Hassadim, Ohr Ruach, %0a%3c descends from them to all the Partzufim of the world of Atzilut during %0a%3c the 6,000 years until the end of correction. %0a%3c %0a%3c 2. YESHSUT is called L of the word TzeLeM, as it bows its head (GAR) %0a%3c and resembles a tower. It is written about this tower: "The Tower of %0a%3c Oz (strength) of the Creator's name." This is because YESHSUT is %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 436 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c called a "tower," and ZA is known as the "righteous one." After all, %0a%3c YESHSUT is ZAT de Bina, the properties of ZON that are included in %0a%3c Bina; hence, it passes its Ohr Hochma to ZON. %0a%3c %0a%3c If ZON in Katnut are filled with Ohr Hassadim (Ruach called Avir— air), then %0a%3c during the reception of Ohr Hochma from YESHSUT, the letter Yod in the word %0a%3c Avir exits, and Avir turns into Ohr (Light). Hence, YESHSUT is called a "tower," %0a%3c i.e., a Partzuf in Gadlut that contains Hochma, soaring in the air (Avir). %0a%3c %0a%3c However, this state in ZON is inconstant. YESHSUT intermittently returns %0a%3c to Katnut and to Gadlut; therefore, such a state is called "soaring." ZA is called %0a%3c Tz (Tzadi) of the word T^eLeM, for such is his property inside this tower. Thus: %0a%3c %0a%3c - AVI— M (Mem)— Hochma that is concealed inside a ring. %0a%3c %0a%3c - YESHSUT— L (Lamed)— Bina, though as she ascends to AA, she becomes %0a%3c Hochma (tower) and passes Ohr Hochma down. %0a%3c %0a%3c - ZON— Tz (Tzadi)— Daat, receives the Light from YESHSUT. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, one should not confuse the three letters Tz-L-M with the three %0a%3c lines called HBD: T^eLeM consists of three Partzufim, one inside the other. %0a%3c Partzuf Hochma (M of the TzeLeM, AVI) is the innermost Partzuf; Partzuf Bina %0a%3c (YESHSUT, L of the TzeLeM) clothes it from Chazeh de AVI downward; and %0a%3c from Chazeh de YESHSUT downwards, Partzuf Bina is clothed by Partzuf Daat, %0a%3c ZA, Tz of the word TzeLeM. %0a%3c %0a%3c The words, THE CREATOR CREATED MAN IN HIS OWN IMAGE %0a%3c (TzeLeM), mean that with the help of the spiritual observance of the Mitzva of %0a%3c Tefillin, Ohr Hochma is received in accordance with the ascending order of the %0a%3c letters Tz-L-M. This is the Light that Adam received after his creation, whereas we %0a%3c first stimulate the reception of this Light in ZON, and from ZON we stimulate %0a%3c its reception into ourselves. %0a%3c %0a%3c THE HEAD TEFILLIN CONTAINS THE NAME OF THE HOLY KING, %0a%3c INSCRIBED IN THE LETTERS HaVaYaH-the head Tefillin is the name of %0a%3c the Supernal King, inscribed in the letters HaVaYaH. The Tefillin are called the %0a%3c Carmel (Car Maleh-all goodness), as it is written: YOUR HEAD UPON YOU %0a%3c IS LIKE THE CARMEL. This is because when the heads of ZA and Malchut put %0a%3c on the head Tefillin (the Upper Light of TzeLeM), they become like the Carmel %0a%3c (Car Maleh— all goodness). %0a%3c %0a%3c This Light is called "The name of the Supernal, Holy King," the four %0a%3c letters of HaVaYaH, where each letter is written separately: Yod-Hey-Vav-Hey . %0a%3c And the reason why man feels that the letters are written separately is that each %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Tenth Commandment %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 437 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Partzuf contains the four letters of HaVaYaH, and each of them designates an %0a%3c independent Partzuf. %0a%3c %0a%3c Every letter constitutes a separate passage on the parchment (in the %0a%3c Tefillin); four separate passages correspond to the four letters of HaVaYaH. A %0a%3c passage (Hebrew— Parashah) represents a separate and complete Partzuf, and its %0a%3c corresponding letter in HaVaYaH symbolizes the Light in this Partzuf. The order %0a%3c of Partzufim corresponds to the order of the letters of HaVaYaH: Yod-Hey-Vav- %0a%3c Hey. Such a Tefillin is called the Tefillin of Rashi. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, there is a Tefillin with the order of passages (Partzufim) Yod-Hey- %0a%3c Hey-Vav, called Tefillin Rabeinu Tarn. The passages that are written on fragments %0a%3c of parchment are identical, but the order of putting them into the boxes of %0a%3c Tefillin Rabeinu Tarn is different: Yod-Hey-Hey-Vav. %0a%3c %0a%3c 238. The first passage in the Tefillin corresponds to the letter Yod of the %0a%3c name HaVaYaH (Hochma) and refers to the Mitzva, "Sanctify to Me all the %0a%3c firstborn." This is because Hochma is the firstborn of all the Supernal Ones. %0a%3c It opens the place of conception for the future firstborn with the help of %0a%3c a thin line of Light that emanates from Yod, which opens the womb and %0a%3c impregnates it. %0a%3c %0a%3c AVI are designated by the letter Yod of the name HaVaYaH, where Yod %0a%3c signifies Aba and the filling of Yod (according to its pronunciation: Yod = Yod + %0a%3c Vav + Dalet), i.e., Vav + Dalet constitutes lma. Partzuf AVI is called "holy" and %0a%3c "first born," for Partzufim YESHSUT and ZON are called holy only when they %0a%3c receive holiness (Ohr Hochma) from AVI. All the holiness in the world of Atzilut %0a%3c comes from AVI. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is so because Ohr Hochma is called "holiness" and AVI is Mem of the %0a%3c word T^eLeM (Hochma de Atzilut), for the Supernal Hochma of the world of Atzilut %0a%3c is concealed within them. AVI themselves are defined as Bina in the property %0a%3c of Hassadim, as Hochma is concealed within Rosh de AA, and the lower ones can %0a%3c receive it only if Bina ascends to Hochma, to Rosh de AA, where Bina unites with %0a%3c Hochma of Rosh de AA and assumes the name Hochma. However, she is not the %0a%3c ordinary Hochma; she is called "Hochma of the thirty-two paths" of descending %0a%3c Ohr Hochma, and only this Hochma bestows Ohr Hochma upon all the Partzufim %0a%3c of the world of Atzilut. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is why The Zohar says that this thin ray of Light, called the "path of %0a%3c Light," opens the womb and conceives the future offspring. Yod consists of three %0a%3c parts: (i) the upper "spike" of the letter Yod, a small line above the point, which %0a%3c is called Rosh and designates Partzuf AA that is concealed in AVI; (ii) the body of %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 438 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c the Yod, which forms PartzufAVl; and (iii) the lower "spike" of the letter, which %0a%3c designates Yesod, the end of Partzuf AVI. %0a%3c %0a%3c Through the continuous Zivug between Yesod de Aba and Yesod de Ima, the %0a%3c great waters descend onto all the lower worlds with all that inhabits them. This %0a%3c Zivug on Ohr Hassadim is called a "Zivug that revives the worlds." Yesod de Ima %0a%3c is also called Rechem (womb), for all Rachamim (mercy) stems from this part of %0a%3c Its Partzuf. Yet, if AVI do not make a Zivug, this part of Ima is closed, and mercy %0a%3c does not descend below. Only Yesod de Aba can open Yesod de Ima, whereupon %0a%3c Ima passes her great waters to the lower ones. %0a%3c %0a%3c 239. The second passage in the Tefillin, WHEN YOU COME, corresponds %0a%3c to the first letter Hey of the name HaVaYaH, the hall (Bind) that opens up %0a%3c under the influence of the letter Yod (Aba) in fifty entrances, passages, and %0a%3c chambers concealed within it. The revelation that Yod made in that hall was %0a%3c done so as to hear the voice of the Shofar (a ram's horn), Bind. The Shofar %0a%3c is closed on all sides, but the letter Yod came and opened it so that its sound %0a%3c could be heard. And since it opened the Shofar and derived sound from it, %0a%3c Yod led all to freedom. %0a%3c %0a%3c The letter Hey of the name HaVaYaH is YESHSUT, L in the word TzeLeM. It %0a%3c is called a "tower soaring in the air," a hall with fifty entrances, for the concealed %0a%3c AVI are designated by the M of TzeLeM, by the ring that surrounds Ohr Hochma %0a%3c and prevents it from shining outside. And they shine only with Ohr Hassadim. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, by rising to Rosh de AA, where Bina turns into Hochma, YESHSUT %0a%3c can pass Ohr Hochma to ZON. Bina, who turns into Hochma in order to receive %0a%3c Hochma for ZON, is called the "fifty gates of Bina," for she consists of five Sefirot %0a%3c KHB-ZA-M, ten in each. Each of these fifty Sefirot consists of a chamber and %0a%3c an entrance: HGT are called a "chamber" and NHY are called an "entrance," %0a%3c a "passage," implying the absence of a Kli for reception. Instead, it serves for %0a%3c transferring the Light into, or out of the chamber. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, the second passage used in the Tefillin: AND WHEN YOU %0a%3c COME designates the letter Hey in the name HaVaYaH, YESHSUT of the world %0a%3c of Atzilut, which ascends to accept Ohr Hochma and pass it on to ZON below. %0a%3c %0a%3c Yod opened this hall so as to hear the voice that comes from the ram's horn, %0a%3c for this horn is closed on all sides. As was already mentioned, YESHSUT (Bina) %0a%3c united with Malchut by lowering her three Sefirot ELEH (Bina and ZON) to %0a%3c ZON, while YESHSUT remained with only two Sefirot KH, MI. %0a%3c %0a%3c Then, as a result of raising MAN, Malchut descends from the Eynaim (eyes), the %0a%3c Eynaim of YESHSUT open up, Malchut descends to her own place in the Peh, and %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Tenth Commandment %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 439 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c the three letters ELEH reunite with MI to form the name ELOKIM. GE = KH de %0a%3c ZON ascend to Bina along with these ELEH. However, although ELEH ascended %0a%3c and joined MI, the name ELOKIM is still considered closed, for it has only Ohr %0a%3c Hochma, and Ohr Hochma cannot shine in ELEH without Ohr Hassadim. %0a%3c %0a%3c These three letters ELEH are therefore defined as a horn (Shofar), and ZON %0a%3c that ascended to Bina along with ELEH are concealed within them. And these %0a%3c ZON in ELEH are referred to as a "voice." This voice sounds in the hall with the %0a%3c help of the letter Yod, for Yod designates AVI that bestow the Light from Above, %0a%3c which facilitates the lowering of Malchut from Nikvey Eynaim de YESHSUT to %0a%3c her place in the Peh, and raising ELEH back to Bina. Hence, Yod opens up the %0a%3c hall of Light in YESHSUT in order to pass this Light to ZON from the Shofar %0a%3c (the ascended letters ELEH). %0a%3c %0a%3c ZON, too, ascend to Bina along with ELEH and there receive Hochma. This %0a%3c great Light in ZA is called a "voice," and its reception is known as "listening to %0a%3c the voice." However, this horn is closed on all sides, on the sides of Hochma and %0a%3c Hassadim, for the letters ELEH (called a "horn") fall to ZON, where they remain %0a%3c closed and inaccessible both to Ohr Hochma and to Ohr Hassadim. %0a%3c %0a%3c Consequently, two corrections are needed: (i) to elevate and unite them %0a%3c with Bina, enabling them to once more attain their Ohr Hochma; (ii) to provide %0a%3c them with Ohr Hassadim so it can serve as a garment for Ohr Hochma. %0a%3c %0a%3c First, Yod (AVI) pass the Light to Hey (YESHSUT), whereupon ELEH rise %0a%3c above Malchut, to Bina, together with ZON, and there receive Ohr Hochma. %0a%3c However, this Ohr Hochma is called concealed or closed, for it cannot shine %0a%3c without being clothed in Ohr Hassadim. This means that the voice has not yet %0a%3c emerged— ZA has not yet been born. %0a%3c %0a%3c After that, Yod enters into the word Light = Ohr; hence, it turns into Avir %0a%3c = air (Ohr Hassadim). And since the horn (the letters ELEH) received air (Ohr %0a%3c Hassadim), they can beget ZA (the voice of the Shofar), for being clothed in Ohr %0a%3c Hassadim, Ohr Hochma can enter ZA. %0a%3c %0a%3c The general Light that ZA receives is called "voice." And this voice frees %0a%3c all the slaves that were enslaved by the egoistic desires in all the worlds, for ZA %0a%3c shines down on all the lower ones. Thus, the sons of Israel (man's spiritual %0a%3c aspirations) merit the Light of deliverance (defeat the earthly, egoistic ones). %0a%3c %0a%3c 240. At the sounds of the Shofar, the sons of Israel were delivered from Egypt. %0a%3c And so shall the Shofar be blown in the future, the next time at the end of %0a%3c days. And all deliverance originates from this Shofar, which is Bina. This is %0a%3c why the deliverance from Egypt is mentioned in this chapter of the Torah, for %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 440 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c this Shofar stems from the force of the letter Yod, which opens the womb and %0a%3c delivers the captives to freedom. And this is the letter Hey, the second letter %0a%3c of the name HaVaYaH. %0a%3c %0a%3c All of the Light in ZON comes from the horn (ELEH), including the great %0a%3c Light that delivers Israel from Egypt, and the Light that is destined to be revealed %0a%3c in the future, at the end of days (complete deliverance from egoism). This is why %0a%3c the Tefillin contain a passage that refers to the exodus from Egypt, for the Light %0a%3c delivering from Egypt comes from the horn, which is inside YESHSUT. This is %0a%3c done by the power of AVI, called Yod de HaVaYaH, which open the womb of %0a%3c YESHSUT (ELEH) and free the voice (ZA) from its captivity. %0a%3c %0a%3c This Light has sufficient power to deliver Israel from slavery. Only after the %0a%3c attainment of this Light (Ohr Haya), and not a degree lower, can ZA and Nukva %0a%3c be called "voice" and "speech." All deliverance comes only from Ohr Haya (only %0a%3c upon ascending the spiritual degree of Ohr Haya can man liberate himself from %0a%3c egoism and become free). %0a%3c %0a%3c 241. The third passage in the Tefillin is the secret of the Unity in "Hear O %0a%3c Israel," the letter Vav in HaVaYaH, which includes all and designates ZA, %0a%3c who contains the unity of all. Everything merges in unity within him, and %0a%3c he receives all. The fourth passage that reads, "You shall hear," includes two %0a%3c sides, Hesed and Qevura, which unite with the Assembly of Israel, called %0a%3c the lower Qevura or Malchut. And this is the last letter Hey of the name %0a%3c HaVaYaH, which takes and includes them all. %0a%3c %0a%3c The third passage in the Tefillin (Hear O Israel) is Partzuf ZA, the letter Vav %0a%3c in HaVaYaH, which includes all four passages contained in the Tefillin. Although %0a%3c the first two passages (AVI and YESHSUT) represent Hochma and Bina, they do %0a%3c not really constitute Hochma and Bina themselves, but rather, their part, which %0a%3c clothes in Rosh de ZON, called M and L of TZeLeM de ZA. %0a%3c %0a%3c Similarly, the fourth passage, Malchut of ZA, does not imply that this is %0a%3c Malchut herself. Rather, it refers to her part that is included in ZA and is called %0a%3c Mochin (brain) de Gevura. There are three parts of Mochin in ZA: Hochma, Bina, %0a%3c and Daat, which are accordingly called M, L and Tz of T^eLeM de ZA. They are %0a%3c the same HB-ZA-M as in Mochin de ZA. This is because Daat (Tz) includes Hesed %0a%3c and Gevura. And this Hesed in Daat is defined as ZA himself, and Gevura is %0a%3c defined as the inclusion (of the properties) of Nukva in ZA. And these H-B-ZA-M %0a%3c constitute the four passages contained in the Tefillin. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is why ZA, the letter Vav in the name HaVaYaH, includes all four %0a%3c passages. And all the unions that come from AVI and YESHSUT are done within %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Tenth Commandment %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 441 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c him, i.e., for his sake. For all the Higher Partzufim that precede ZA are united %0a%3c (with the Creator), and need no MAN from the lower ones to reach the state of %0a%3c unity. Whereas all the MAN raised by the lower ones to the Upper Partzufim are %0a%3c meant solely for the unification of ZA, and in no way affect the constant unity %0a%3c of the Higher Partzufim with the Creator. %0a%3c %0a%3c The unification of Hochma with Bina, as a result of which Bina becomes %0a%3c like Hochma, occurs only on account of ZA being raised to Bina in the form of %0a%3c MAN. For when ZA is raised to Bina as MAN, Bina ascends to Rosh de AA and %0a%3c there receives Hochma for ZA. Since Bina aspires only to mercy (Ohr Hassadim), %0a%3c she never receives Ohr Hochma for the Creator's sake, but only if the lower ones %0a%3c are in need of it. Her role, her properties are only to bestow, and not to receive. %0a%3c (Note that in the spiritual, "reception" is always for the Creator's sake.) %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, Bina ascends to Rosh de AA only for the sake of ZON. And it is ZA %0a%3c alone that ascends to Bina and stimulates her to ascend to Rosh de AA, where she %0a%3c makes a Zivug with Hochma and passes this Light to him. It is therefore said that %0a%3c ZA receives all, as Bina passes everything that she receives in Rosh de AA to him. %0a%3c And Ohr Hochma is revealed only in the place of ZA (not Bina), as he descends %0a%3c back to his place below Chazeh de ZA. %0a%3c %0a%3c The prayer "Hear O Israel" designates ZA, the letter Vav of the name %0a%3c HaVaYaH, the Supernal unity (item 207) that reveals love only from the good %0a%3c side. And since it refers only to "Love your Creator...," it contains no restrictions %0a%3c or strictness of judgment. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, in the fourth passage, "You shall hear," the last Hey of the name %0a%3c HaVaYaH, Nukva de ZA that is included in him, Gevura in Rosh de ZA, reveals %0a%3c both sides of love— good, as well as evil (item 206), reflected in the words of this %0a%3c passage. It ends with the words: "Blessed be His great name for ever and ever," %0a%3c which corresponds to the inclusion and unity of Nukva in ZA, meaning not %0a%3c Nukt/a herself, but her part in ZA, i.e., Mochin de Daat. %0a%3c %0a%3c Gevura in Daat is the second Hey in HaVaYaH. It accepts all the Light of %0a%3c the Supernal unity contained in "Hear O Israel," and includes all. And since it %0a%3c contains all the perfection of unity, it reveals all the Light and both sides of love, %0a%3c for the property of judgment that complements love to perfection exists only %0a%3c within it, and not Above. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is therefore written: "Your head upon you is like the Carmel, " des ignating %0a%3c the head Tefillin. Indeed, after ZA is clothed in all four Lights, designated by %0a%3c the four paragraphs of the Tefillin, which are the three letters Tz, L, and M of %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 442 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c the word T^eLeM, his head is defined as the Carmel (Car Maleh— completely %0a%3c filled with goodness). %0a%3c %0a%3c 242. Tefillin are the letters of the holy name. Therefore, "Your head upon %0a%3c you is like the Carmel" refers to the head Tefillin. The letter Dcdet refers to %0a%3c the hand Tefillin, Malchut, who is depleted of Light, compared to the head %0a%3c Tefillin, ZA, but she contains the perfection of the Upper One. %0a%3c %0a%3c The hand Tefillin designates Malchut. And she is poor in comparison with %0a%3c Bina, the Upper World. Yet, she has her own perfection, for she now receives it %0a%3c from Bina thanks to the unity between Nukva and ZA in "Blessed be His great %0a%3c name for ever and ever." %0a%3c %0a%3c And since she is not the Nukva that is included in ZA (his body), but a %0a%3c separate Nukva of ZA, she takes all four passages from him, H-B-ZA-M of ZA, for %0a%3c she has a separate, complete Partzuf. However, these four passages of the Torah %0a%3c are in the same place; they are not separated from each other by partitions, as %0a%3c in the Tefillin of ZA. %0a%3c %0a%3c The reason for this is that a passage of the Torah is the Light, and the place %0a%3c where it dwells is a Kli (the Tefillin in our world is a box made of a "pure" animal's %0a%3c skin, into which four parchment scrolls are placed, and the corresponding %0a%3c passages from the Torah are written on each). As we know, every Zivug emanates %0a%3c Light. Since ZA receives four Lights H-B-H-G in four Kelim, as a result of four %0a%3c Zivugim, he contains four compartments for four passages, each compartment %0a%3c containing a particular passage from the Torah. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, no Zivug is made on Malchut herself. Everything that Malchut has, %0a%3c she receives from ZA. Malchut receives all four Lights (four passages from the %0a%3c Torah that result from one Zivug with ZA); hence, she has only one place for all %0a%3c four passages (Lights). %0a%3c %0a%3c 243. "The King is held captive in the tubs" means that he is tied down and held %0a%3c in those four compartments of the Tefillin for the purpose of being properly %0a%3c united with that holy name. And he who makes this correction, exists in image %0a%3c and likeness, TZELEM, with the Creator. Just as the holy name is united in %0a%3c the Creator, the holy name is united in him. "Male and female he created %0a%3c them" refers to the head and the hand Tefillin. And it is one. %0a%3c %0a%3c "The King is held captive in the tubs" signifies ZA, who is bound and %0a%3c unified in those compartments of the Tefillin. The compartments of the Tefillin, %0a%3c which contain the passages from the Torah, are called "tubs" or "troughs," just %0a%3c like the tubs from which sheep drink water, for the waters of Ohr Hochma and %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Tenth Commandment %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 443 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Ohr Hassadim are bound and restricted by these Kelim, the compartments of the %0a%3c Tefillin. And it is the Creator who is bound tight and held in these Kelim, so as %0a%3c to be unified in the holy name. %0a%3c %0a%3c The compartments of the Tefillin are the TNHY of Tvuna, the lower part of %0a%3c YESHSUT (Israel-Saba and Tvuna, where Israel-Saba is the male part and Tvuna %0a%3c is the female). This part of Tvuna is called the big letter Dalet of the word Echad %0a%3c (one) in the verse, "Hear O Israel, our Creator is one." It is written about this %0a%3c letter: "Let the dry land appear." %0a%3c %0a%3c As was already mentioned in the third Mitzva, because this "dry land" was %0a%3c revealed in ZA, he can pass the Light to Malchut. Thus, were it not for these four %0a%3c places in ZA, the dry land within him, he would have been unable to give the %0a%3c Light to Nukva. Hence, it is said that ZA "is tied down and held in those places" %0a%3c that stem from dry land so as to enable him to unite and pass the revelation of %0a%3c the Creator's Light into the holy name, Nukva. As a result, the dry land becomes %0a%3c fertile and produces fruit. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, he who has completed the corrections of these four passages %0a%3c from the Torah acquires the image and likeness (T^eLeM) of the Creator. In %0a%3c other words, when man "below" (below the world of Atzilut, in the worlds BYA) %0a%3c "puts on" the Tefillin (attains the level of this degree), he receives the Light of H- %0a%3c B-H-G from ZA. This Light is called TzeLeM, since Hochma and Bina are called M %0a%3c and L, whereas Hesed and Gevura are called Tz. And just like Elokim, Bina unites %0a%3c with the holy name of Malchut, thereby uniting the holy name within man, for %0a%3c man is a part of Malchut. %0a%3c %0a%3c There are two parts— male and female— in the Light of Hochma and Bina %0a%3c (called TzeLeM): TzeLeM of ZA and TzeLeM of Nukva, the head Tefillin and the %0a%3c hand Tefillin. Hence, it is said that the Creator created a man and a woman, %0a%3c referring to the head Tefillin and the hand Tefillin. %0a\ No newline at end of file%0a
