XXIII. %0a%0aThe  expressions  **  very  pure  gold  and  silver,"  %3c%3c  purest  gold," %0afound  in  Scripture,  warrant  us  in  the  belief  that  cupellation  is  a %0aprocess  of  very  ancient  date.  "  Take  away  the  dross  from  the %0asilver,  and  there  shall  come  forth  a  vessel  for  the  finer."  ^  "  As %0athe  fining  pot  for  silver  and  the  furnace  for  gold  :  so  is  a  man  to %0ahis  praise."  ' %0a%0aThe  ancients  knew  that  gold  and  silver  were  rarely  found  in  a %0astate  of  purity ;  the  "  x/S^%3c7^t  £ri/^o« "  of  the  Greeks  was  the  Arabian %0agold  of  the  xlvii.  chapter  of  Theophilus' ;  the  gold  which  had  been %0apurified  by  cupellation  was  called  **  ^fvcor,"— "auram  obryzum," %0aor  "  ad  obrussam  "  of  Pliny.  The  ancients  were  also  in  the  prac- %0atice of  employing  lead  for  purifying  gold  and  silver.  "  They  add %0aa  proportipn  of  lead,  according  to  the  quantity  of  gold."  * %0a%0aIt  would  perhaps  be  well,  in  this  place,  to  inquire  whether  the %0aancients  were  ignorant  of  the  action  of  the  mineral  acids,  or  the %0a%0a%0a'  Proverbs,  xxr.  4. %0a%0a■  lb.  xxYii.  21. %0a%0a■  Diodorus  Siculus,  II.  161.

Theophrastus  adds,  "  And  many  other %0athings  of  this  kind  other  persons,  perhaps,  may  attain."^ %0a%0aPliny  is  more  explicit,  or  rather  the  science  had  advanced  since %0athe  Greek  had  written,  and  the  prediction  of  Theophrastus  had %0aapparently  been  fulfilled. %0a%0aIn  the  chapter  upon  gold,  L.  33.  C.  4,  Pliny  hands  down  this %0aremarkable  sentence. %0a%0a%3c«  Torretur  etiam  cum  salis  grumo,  pondere  triplici  misto,  et  nir- %0asum  cum  duabus  salis  portionibus,  et  una  lapidis,  quem  schiston %0avocant :  ita  virus  tradit  rebus  unk  crematis  in  fictili  vase,  ipsum %0apurum  et  incorruptum." %0a%0a'*  It  is  also  calcined  with  salt  grumus,  mixed  in  threefold  weight, %0aand  again  with  two  portions  of  salt  and  one  of  a  stone  which  they %0acall  schist  us :  thus,  the  substances  being  burned  together  in  an %0aearthen  vessel,  the  bitterness  yields  it  pure  and  uncorrupted." %0a%0aShould  the  "  sal  grumus"'  be  the  sulphate  of  potash,  (Glauber*  s %0asalt,)  this,  with  the  schiston,  acting  upon  the  common  salt  (muriate %0aof  soda,)  with  the  presence  of  water,  yielded  by  the  salts  and  alu- %0amine,  would,  under  the  action  of  heat,  yield  a  muriatic  or  hydro- %0achloric acid,  called  in  after  times  ''the  spirit  of  salt,"  the  gold  would %0abe  liberated,  the  sulphur  combining  with  the  soda,  alumina,  &c. %0a%0aThe  schiston  was  of  many  kinds,  one  a  sort  of  hsematite,  another %0aof  anthracite,  but  a  third  a  species  of  calcantfaus,  or  sulphurous %0acopper  ore,  from  which  a  schiston  was  made,  called  by  Pliny  a %0aconcrete  alum — this  is  no  other  than  our  chrystallized  sulphate %0aof  copper  '. %0a%0aGeber  has  the  credit  of  the  invention  of  the  mineral  acids,  yet %0ahe  writes  as  if  he  were  not  the  inventor,  but  rather  the  compiler  of %0a%0a>  Theophnstui  on  StonM.

He %0aadds  that  if  you  supply  a  quarter  of  sal  ammoniac  to  this  it  will %0adissolve  gold*.  The  vitriol  of  Cyprus  is  a  sulphate  of  copper ;  the %0anitrate  of  potash  and  muriate  of  ammonia  (sal  ammoniac)  reacting %0aupon  each  other  form  the  "  aqua  regia,"  or  mixture  of  nitric  and %0ahydrochloric  acid,  the  sulphuric  acid  combining  with  the  salifiable %0abases. %0a%0aIn  c.  xxxiii.

In  effect  the  second  finger,  remaining  open, %0aindicates  I  (iota),  and  the  third  formsi  by  the  curye,  a  C  (sigma). %0aThe  thumb  is  placed  across  the  fourth  finger ;  the  fifth  is  likewise %0aa  little  bent,  which  forms  an  indication  of  the  word  (XPICTOC)  XC ; %0afor  the  meeting  of  the  thumb  and  the  fourth  finger  forms  a  X %0a(chi),  and  the  little  finger  forms,  by  its  curve,  a  C  (sigma).  These %0atwo  letters  are  the  abridgment  of  Chmstos.  Thus,  through  the %0adivine  providence  of  die  Creator,"  continues  the  monk,  **  the %0afingers  of  the  hand  of  man,  be  they  more  or  less  long,  are  arranged %0ato  be  so  as  able  to  design  the  name  of  Christ."' %0a%0a**  The  western  Church,"  writes  M.  Didron,  **is  less  mystic  The %0abenediction  is  made  in  opening  the  three  first  fingers  of  the  right %0ahand,  and  in  keeping  the  annulary  and  the  litde  finger  shut  It %0ais  true  that  certain  liturgists,  OuiUaume  Dnrand,  amongst  others» %0asay  (Rationale  divinorum  offic.  1.  v.  c.  2.)  that  "  this  mode  of  bless- %0aing recalls  the  Trinity." %0a%0a**  In  the  church  of  Mount  Hymettus,  the  Father  blesses  by %0aopening  only  the  great  finger  and  index ;  but  this  may  be  an  error, %0aand  I,  perhaps,  imperfectly  saw  it.  It  is  possible  that  a  Greek %0abenediction  may  be  met  with  amongst  us  ;  such  a  fact  should  be %0aestablished  with  the  utmost  care,  as  incontestably  proving  a  By- %0azantine influence.  M.  Aymard  has  found,  in  the  cathedral  at %0aPuy,  a  hand  blessing  in  the  Greek  manner.  ''  This  church,"  says %0aM.  Didron,  "  is  vaulted  with  cupolas,  as  a  Byzantine  church,  and %0aproves  that  the  ancient  churches  with  cupolas  are  really  Byzan- %0atine, although  not  the  only  ones." %0a%0aC.  XXVIII.  DE  NIGELLO. %0a%0aThe  beauty  of  the  chalice,  designed  by  Theophilus,  will  not %0aescape  the  attention  of  the  artist,  nor  will  the  value  of  the  recom- %0amendation to  "  carve  with  a  bold  stroke  "  in  the  preparation  of %0athe  ground  for  the  %3c'  niello  "  be  lost.  The  value  of  this  and  the %0a26th  chapters  will  be  seen  by  those  who  will  take  the  trouble  to %0acompare  them  with  the  readings  of  all  other  copies  of  the  MS. %0aof  Theophilus. %0a%0aThe  Roman  casket  of  silver,  enriched  with  niello,  found  at %0aRome  in  a  ruin  near  the  Esquiline  gate,  and  which  was  of  the  4tb %0a%0a»  Manuel  diconographie  Chr^tieimc.

The  chrystallized  urates %0aare  called  by  Paracelsus  "  Barnabas,  or  Barnaas,"  which  he  de- %0ascribes as  the  ''  sal  petrse  urinarius  ;  urina  salis  petrae." %0a%0aBarach,  borak  or  borax,  the  native  borate  of  soda^  began %0athrough  the  Arab  chemists,  or  alchemists^  to  be  distinguished  in %0athe  arts  from  the  9th  century. %0a%0aThe  Montpellier  MS.>  already  quoted  in  the  notes  to  L.  1,  gives %0athe  composition  of  nigellum  which  is  to  be  used  with  "  boraxa  " %0aas  a  flux;  the  composition  of  the  niello  is  from  silver,  copper,  sul- %0aphur, and  lead ;  the  same  materials,  although  in  different  propor- %0ations,  as  those  of  Theophilus,  borax  is  therefore  probably  intended %0aby  him.

"  Cinis  fsecis  vini  nitri %0anaturam  habet,  easdemque  vires,  hoe  amplius,  quo  pinguior  sen- %0atitur."*  The  lixivium  of  this  ash,  freed  from  impurities,  and %0aagain  evaporated,  produced  the  wine-stone  of  our  author,  the  bi- %0atartrate  of  potass,  or  cream  of  tartar,  of  commerce.  It  is  here %0adirected  to  be  used  as  a  flux,  as  is  the  borate  of  soda  in  chap.  29. %0a(tee  notes  to  L.  %25,  on  glass-painting.) %0a%0aC.  XXXII. %0a%0aThe  reader  will  remark  the  operation  of  enriching  the  silver %0achalice  with  niello,  how  closely  it  resembles  the  preparation  of  an %0aengraved  plate  for  printing.  It  is  said  that  the  accidental  impres- %0asion, or  proof  of  the  nielled  pax  of  Finignerra  was  the  origin  of %0acopper-plate  printing.  Upon  turning  to  C.  LXXL,  the  process  de- %0ascribed by  Theophilus,  for  blackening  or  nielling  copper,  which %0aled  to  the  art  of  printing  from  an  engraved  copper  plate,  is  nearly %0aa  description  of  the  art  itself.  Two  impressions  of  the  pax  exist %0ain  Paris,  one  at  the  Biblioth^que  Roy  ale,  another  at  the  Biblio- %0ath^que  de  1' Arsenal. %0a%0aC.

The %0awhole  process  is  worthy  attention  as  is  the  preparation  for  receiv- %0aing the  gilding  called  "  invivare,'*  by  Theophilus,  consisting  of %0abitartrate  of  potass,  muriate  of  soda,  and  quicksilver. %0a%0a%0aC.  XL.    «  OF  COLOURING  GOLD." %0a%0aThe  process  here  described  is  calculated  to  produce  the  same %0aaction  upon  the  surface  of  an  impure  gold  as  that  followed  by %0asubmitting  it  to  the  action  of  a  diluted  muriatic  acid.  Atramentum, %0aor  the  sulphate  of  copper^  (or  iron,)  having  been  partly  deprived %0aof  the  sulphuric  acid  it  contains,  is  again  subjected  to  heat  in  the %0apresence  of  muriate  of  soda  and  the  uric  salts,  upon  the  surface  of %0athe  gold  to  be  purified.  The  result  would  form  a  certain  propor- %0ation of  muriatic  acid  which,  removing  the  alloy  it  might  contain, %0awould  render  the  gold  pure,  thereby  colouring,  or  rather  de-co- %0alouring the  metal. %0a%0a%0aC.  XLV.     DE  FISTULA.— OP  THE  PIPE.  ^ %0a%0aThe  reed,  called  also  syphon,  canna,  calamus,  etc.,  was  an  in- %0astrument formerly  used  in  the  Roman  church  in  the  service  of %0acommunion,  in  order  to  withdraw  the  wine  from  the  chalice  for %0afear  of  spilling  it. %0a%0aIts  use  was  preserved  during  a  long  time  in  many  monasteries  * ; %0aat  Cluny,  at  St.  Denis^,  in  the  ceremonies  of  the  consecration  of %0athe  Kings  of  France  *:  now  the  Pope  alone  employs  it  in  the  cele- %0abration of  Roman  ceremonies. %0a%0aThe  Benedictines,  authors  of  the  **  Voyage  Lxtteraire^**  describe %0aa  reed,  which  they  saw  in  the  treasury  of  the  Abbey  of  Corbie : %0a%0a'  Note,  bj  the  Count  de  rSscalopier. %0a%0a*  Bona,  lUr,  LUwrg.

They  have  a  small  spoon  with  which %0athe  priest  takes  one  of  these  small  pieces  dii^d  in  the  wine,  and  he %0athus  gives  it  to  the  communicants.  It  is  only  to  the  priests  and %0aclerks  assisting  at  the  Liturgy  that  they  give  the  chalice.  The %0aGreeks  assert  that  8t.  John  Ghrysostome  established  the  use  of %0athis  spoon,  but  there  is  no  certain  proof  amongst  the  ecclesiastical %0awriters.  According  to  the  legend  it  was  thus,  that  about  the  year %0a400,  a  solitary  saint  of  Egypt  received  a  miraculous  Eucharist %0awhjch  was  brought  to  him  by  angels. %0a%0a*'  The  spoon  was  consecrated  as  well  as  the  chalice  and  patena. %0aThis  instrument,  unknown  to  the  Latins,  as  was  the  reed  to  the %0aGreeks,  is  not  mentioned  by  Theophilus,  who  has  in  view  only  the %0apomps  of  the  Western  Church." %0a%0a%0aC.  XLVIII.     DE  AURO  HISPANICO. %0a%0aWhen  the  smile,  excited  by  the  language  of  those  who  followed %0athe  sacred  science,  "ima^fAm  "p«,"  or  chemistry,  shall  have %0apassed,  we  shall  probably  be  anxious  to  search  into  the  meaning %0aof  our  author. %0a%0aThe  Egyptians,  according  to  all  authorities,  practised  the  science %0aat  a  remote  period,  and  it  was  in  their  schools  that  the  Greeks  and %0aArabs  were  initiated  into  the  sacred  science,  the  revelation  of  the %0amysteries  of  which  was,  at  one  time,  punished  by  death. %0a%0aTheophilus,  who  informs  us  that  ''the  skilfulness  of  the  Gentiles %0ain  this  art  is  probable,"  is  doubtless  alluding  to  the  Arab  alche- %0amists of  Spain,  who  at  an  early  period  pursued  the  sciences  ac- %0aquired from  the  Greeks  and  Egyptians. %0a%0aThe  process  which  Theophilus  describes  in  this  symbolic  lan- %0aguage, appears  no  other  than  that  for  procuring  a  pure  gold  by  the %0ameans  of  the  mineral  acids.  Let  a  solution  of  gold  be  made  by %0anitro-muriatic  acid  and  copper  be  introduced,  the  latter  would  be %0adissolved  while  the  gold  would  re-appear,  but  in  a  state  of  purity, %0aor,  as  the  alchemists  would  have  expressed  it,  the  copper  would %0a%0a%0aNOTES   TO    BOOK    III.  433 %0a%0ahave  been  trantmuted  into  pure  gold,  "  donee  ipsa  confectio  cuprum %0atransraordeat,  et  inde  pondus  et  colorem  auri  suscipiat." %0a%0aWe  have  already  seen  that  the  ancients  were  aware  of  the  action %0aupon  metals  of  substances  calculated  to  produce  the  mineral  acids %0ain  the  art  of  refining,  and  that  the  Arab  alchemists  have  described %0athese  acids  in  unequivocal  terms.— Numbers»  letters,  the  signs  of %0athe  zodiac,  animals,  plants  and  organic  substances,  form  the  sym- %0abolic vocabulary  of  the  alchemists  of  this  period.  The  basilisc, %0athe  dragon^  the  red  and  green  lions,  were  the  sulphates  of  copper %0aand  of  iron ;  the  yellow  lion,  of  the  yellow  sulphurets ;  the  black %0aeagle,  the  black  sulphurets ;  the  red  lion  was  sometimes  cinnabar ; %0athe  salamander,  fire ;  milk  of  a  black  cow,  mercury ;  the  egg, %0agold ;  the  red  dragon,  cinnabar ;  &c.,  &c.  Unfortunately  each %0achemist  appears  to  have  varied  the  symbols  in  use  ^ %0a•  The  toad,  "  ugly  and  venomous,  bears  yet  a  precious  jewel  in %0aits  head,"  ^  the  toads  of  Theophilus  which  hatch  the  eggs,  are %0aprobably  fragments  of  the  mineral  salt,  nitrate  of  potash,  which %0awould  yield  one  of  the  elements  of  the  solvent  for  gold ;  the  blood %0aof  a  red  man^  which  has  been  dried  and  ground,  probab  ly  a  mu- %0ariate of  ammonia ;  fine  earth,  a  muriate  of  soda  (common  salt) ; %0athe  cocks,  the  sulphates  of  copper  and  iron  ;  the  eggs,  gold  ore ; %0athe  hatched  chickens,  which  require  a  stone  pavement^  sulphuric %0aacid  produced  by  burning  these  in  a  stone  vessel,  collecting  the %0afumes ;  these  are  then  all  digested  together  tempered  with  a  sharp %0aacid.  The  elements  of  nitro-muriatic  acid  are  all  here,  the  sol- %0avent for  gold* %0a%0aGeber  tell  us  that  the  salt  drawn  from  the  ashes  of  a  mole  will %0aconvert  copper  into  gold.

The %0aGreeks  had  previously  portrayed  Christ  under  different  allegorical %0aforms  —  the  Good  Shepherd,  as  Orpheus  disarming  Cruelty  by %0ameans  of  the  suavity  of  his  accents :  as  the  new  Daniel,  naked %0aamongst  the  Lions,  which  are  disarmed  by  his  grace  :  as  Phcenix, %0aconqueror  of  the  Spirits  of  Darkness,  &c.,&c.

LXI. %0a%0a"  You  will  adapt  to  each  Apostle  a  corresponding  prophet,  that %0atheir  testimonies  may  agree,"  writes  Theophilus. %0a%0aOur  author,  who,  it  has  been  seen,  wrote  for  the  provision  of %0athe  ceremonies  of  the  Roman  church,  is  anxious  that  this  early %0abranch  of  Christian  iconography  should  not  be  neglected.  Theo- %0aphilus has  afforded  us  so  few  points  by  whicfi  we  may  be  enabled  to %0atrace  the  period  at  which  he  wrote,  that  these  few  words,  hitherto %0aneglected,  should  certainly  be  considered  if  at  all  bearing  upon  that %0aquestion. %0a%0aMons.  Didron,  who  has  paid  as  much,  if  not  more,  attention  to %0athe  history  of  Christian  art  as  any  author,  and  whose  researches  in %0aGreece  have  so  qualified  him  for  judging  upon  this  branch  of %0aarchaeology  that  his  opinion  may  be  accepted  as  authority,  de- %0aclares that  the  higher  we  mount  into  the  history  of  Christianity, %0athe  more  we  find  the  Judaic  influence  prevail.  **  The  western %0achurch,  in  France  in  particular,  ended  by  withdrawing  itself  from %0athis  Oriental  embrace,  but  traces  of  it  are  found  in  the  most %0aancient  of  our  monuments  and  liturgy."  St.  Moses,  St.  Samuel, %0aSt.  Daniel,  St.  EHas,  St.  Jeremiah^  St.  Isaiah,  all  the  holy  patri- %0aarchs, prophets,  and  teachers  of  the  law,  figure  in  the  ancient %0alitanies.  "  In  the  cathedral  of  Strasburg,  upon  the  ancient  glass, %0asome  of  which  dates  even  from  the  eleventh  century,  Isaiah  is %0aseen  with  the  nimbus,  like  a  saint  of  the  New  Testament.  Stras- %0aburg," he  adds,  '*  is  German,  and  Germany  owes  much  to  Byzan- %0atium. The  Greek  Church  honours  the  saints  of  the  Old  Testa- %0ament as  much  as  those  of  the  New,  therefore  the  patriarchs^ %0aprophets,  judges,  and  kings  of  Judah,  occupy  an  important  place %0ain  the  Byzantine  paintings." %0a%0aIn  the  public  library  at  Amiens  is  a  manuscript  believed  to  be %0a%0a%0aNOTES    TO    BOOK    III.  437 %0a%0aof  the  ninth  century,  but  which,  says  M.  Didron,  is  certainly  an- %0aterior to  the  schism  consummated  by  Michael  Cerularius ;  it  is  a %0abook  of  psalms.  At  the  end  of  the  MS.  is  a  prayer^  a  litany  where %0aall  the  orders  of  saints,  apostles,  &c.,  are  successively  invoked. %0aImmediately  after  the  angels  and  before  the  apostles  the  patriarchs %0aand  prophets  are  one  by  one  invoked.

LXIII.     CALAMINE. %0a%0aThe  calamine  or  cadmia  of  the  ancients,  which  Pliny  tells  was %0aused  in  the  manufacture  of  brass,  ''  lapis,  ex  quo  fit  ass,  cadmia %0avocatur,"  ^  is  the  rough  zinc  ore ;  Dioscorides  informs  us  that  cad- %0amia is  produced  during  the  calcination  of  brass,  and  that  it  attaches %0aitself  upon  the  sides  of  the  furnace'^ %0a%0a*  This  respect,  which  the  Roman  church  gradoallj  lost  for  the  holy  characters  of %0athe  Old  Testament,  and  which  M.  Didron  designates  as  the  "  Judaic  influence,"  has %0abeen  perpetuated  amongst  us  in  England,  which  has  also  otherwise  been  so  strongly %0aimpressed  by  the  Byzantine  genius. %0a%0aOur  finest  Gothic  cathedrals  are  upon  the  plan  of  the  double  or  Greek  cross ;  our %0aliturgy  greatly  imbued  with  the  writings  of  the  Greek  Fathers. %0a%0aI  insert  a  note  of  the  learned  M.  Durand,  -upon  the  effect  of  Jewish  and  Byzan- %0atine  influence  upon  England.  It  is  singular,  that  no  sooner  does  a  Frenchman  ap- %0aproach any  subject  with  which  England  is  connected,  than  his  ideas  seem  to  run  riot. %0aThere  is,  however,  some  truth  in  the  following.  "  The  names  of  Adam,  Isaac, %0aJacob,  Abraham,  Moses,  David,  Solomon,  &c.,  are  very  common  in  Greece ;  there  is %0aJew  in  all  that.  It  would  seem  that  Byzantium,  nearer  than  Rome  to  Jerusalem %0aand  the  Holy  Land,  has  not  been  sufficiently  capable  of  escaping  firom  the  Old  Testar- %0ament.  What  it  it  proper  to  remark  u,  that  England,  Jewish  hy  commerce,  is  Jewish %0aand  Byzantine  in  her  religious  customs,  JSentham  is  called  Jeremiah ;  Reynold, %0aJoshua  ;  Newton,  Isaac  ;  Oarrick,  David  ;  0*Connell  is  called  Daniel.  St  George, %0athe  patron  of  Greece,  and  to  whom  the  patriarchal  church  at  Constantinople  is  dedi- %0acated, is  patron  of  England.  England  gives  this  name  to  the  branch  of  the  sea %0awhich  separates  her  from  Ireland.     The  celebrated  Canning  vus  coiled  Georges.** %0a%0a»  PUny,  Hist.  Nat.     L.  34.

Theophilus,  in  designating  this  as  Arabian  work,  has %0acaused  Emeric  David  ^  and  M.  de  TEscalopier'  to  think  that  the %0aword  interrasilis  means  Damascus  work,  "  damasquinure"  or  the %0athreaded  gold  or  silver  work  seen  upon  the  sabres,  pistols,  cui- %0arasses, &c.,  of  the  east  We  fortunately  possess  a  chapter  in  this %0aMS.  in  which  this  latter  art  is  carefully  detailed ;  the  damascine %0awork  is  described  in  one  of  the  chapters  hitherto  unknown,  C.  90. %0a%0aThe  opus  interrasilis,  then,  is  an  engraved  or  sculptured  plate, %0athe  plain  grounds  of  which  are  cut  out  with  the  chisel,  or  **mei£el," %0ain  the  German.

"  DE  ORGANIS." %0a%0aIt  will  be  seen  that  the  Harleian  MS.  of  Theophilus  enriches %0athe  archaeologist  with  three  new  chapters  upon  the  construction  of %0athe  organ^  which  seems  in  the  time  of  our  author  to  have  been  of  a %0asimple  construction. %0a%0aDavid,  in  the  cl.

Eraclius  has  a %0achapter  on  this.  "  Should  you  wish  to  bend  ivory  and  ornament %0ait"  Take  sulphate  of  potass,  (glumen  roiundum  \)  fossil  salt,  (sal %0agemma,  muriate  of  soda,)  and  vitriol,  (calcanthum,  sulphate  of %0acopper,)  these  are  ground  with  very  sharp  vinegar  in  a  brass  mortar. %0aInto  this  mixture  the  ivory  is  placed  for  three  days  and  nights. %0aThis  being  done,  you  will  hollow  out  a  piece  of  wood,  as  you %0aplease.  The  ivory  being  then  placed  in  the  hollow  you  direct  it, %0aand  will  bend  it  to  your  will. %0a%0aIn  the  MS.  Sloane,  416,  p.  40,  already  quoted,  is  a  similar  re- %0acipe, with  the  addition  that  these  matters  are  to  be  distilled  in %0aequal  parts,  (per  alembicum,)  this  would  yield  muriatic  acid,  with %0athe  presence  of  water ;  the  MS.  adds  that  "  infused  in  this  water %0ahalf  a  day,  ivory  is  made  so  soft  that  it  can  be  cut  like  wax. %0aAnd  when  you  wish  it  hardened,  place  it  in  white  vinegar  and  it %0abecomes  hard." %0a%0a%0aC.

Both  these  substances  generally  con- %0atained arsenic^  the  volatilization  of  which,  with  that  of  the  zinc, %0awould  produce  a  mixture  of  the  oxides  of  arsenic  and  zinc ;  the %0adeposition  in  the  lower  chamber,  of  a  darker  colour  and  less  pure, %0awere  combinations  of  the  zinc  with  other  substances,  accord- %0aing to  the  nature  of  the  ore  calamine  employed,  and  was  called %0a•podium  \ %0a%0aGeber  tells  us  that  "  arsenic  is  composed  of  subtle  matter,  and  is %0aof  the  nature  of  sulphur ;  it  h  fixed  by  the  metals,  like  sulphur,  and %0alike  it  is  produced  by  the  calcination  of  the  metals : "  (is  not  this %0athe  white  sulphur  of  the  Greeks  ?)  '*  Therefore  it  is  not  proper  to %0abe  classed  (diffiniri)  otherwise  than  sulphur."^ %0a%0aAlbertus  Magnus,  whose  writings  are  in  great  measure  a  re^ %0asumi  of  the  Greek  and  Arab  chemists,  tells  us  that  brass  will %0ayield  arsenic ;  '*  sbs  expirabit  arsenicum."^ %0a%0aThe  Oifor  Xft;xo»,  white  sulphur,  was  that  which  produced  white %0abrass:  Olympiodorus  knew  that  arsenic  gave  a  white  colour  to %0acopper,  and  he  calls  it  a  kind  of  sulphur  which  is  volatilized  by  the %0aaction  of  fire.

The  knowledge  of  tempering %0a%3c iron  or  steel  appears  to  be  very  ancient,  as  in  Proverbs,  xxvii.  17, %0a%3c *'  Iron  sharpeneth  iron,"  would  indicate. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c C.  XXIII. %0a%3c %0a%3c The  expressions  **  very  pure  gold  and  silver,"  %3c%3c  purest  gold," %0a%3c found  in  Scripture,  warrant  us  in  the  belief  that  cupellation  is  a %0a%3c process  of  very  ancient  date.  "  Take  away  the  dross  from  the %0a%3c silver,  and  there  shall  come  forth  a  vessel  for  the  finer."  ^  "  As %0a%3c the  fining  pot  for  silver  and  the  furnace  for  gold  :  so  is  a  man  to %0a%3c his  praise."  ' %0a%3c %0a%3c The  ancients  knew  that  gold  and  silver  were  rarely  found  in  a %0a%3c state  of  purity ;  the  "  x/S^%3c7^t  £ri/^o« "  of  the  Greeks  was  the  Arabian %0a%3c gold  of  the  xlvii.  chapter  of  Theophilus' ;  the  gold  which  had  been %0a%3c purified  by  cupellation  was  called  **  ^fvcor,"— "auram  obryzum," %0a%3c or  "  ad  obrussam  "  of  Pliny.  The  ancients  were  also  in  the  prac- %0a%3c tice of  employing  lead  for  purifying  gold  and  silver.  "  They  add %0a%3c a  proportipn  of  lead,  according  to  the  quantity  of  gold."  * %0a%3c %0a%3c It  would  perhaps  be  well,  in  this  place,  to  inquire  whether  the %0a%3c ancients  were  ignorant  of  the  action  of  the  mineral  acids,  or  the %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c '  Proverbs,  xxr.  4. %0a%3c %0a%3c ■  lb.  xxYii.  21. %0a%3c %0a%3c ■  Diodorus  Siculus,  II.  161.

Theophrastus  adds,  "  And  many  other %0a%3c things  of  this  kind  other  persons,  perhaps,  may  attain."^ %0a%3c %0a%3c Pliny  is  more  explicit,  or  rather  the  science  had  advanced  since %0a%3c the  Greek  had  written,  and  the  prediction  of  Theophrastus  had %0a%3c apparently  been  fulfilled. %0a%3c %0a%3c In  the  chapter  upon  gold,  L.  33.

DE  AURO  HISPANICO. %0a%3c %0a%3c When  the  smile,  excited  by  the  language  of  those  who  followed %0a%3c the  sacred  science,  "ima^fAm  "p«,"  or  chemistry,  shall  have %0a%3c passed,  we  shall  probably  be  anxious  to  search  into  the  meaning %0a%3c of  our  author. %0a%3c %0a%3c The  Egyptians,  according  to  all  authorities,  practised  the  science %0a%3c at  a  remote  period,  and  it  was  in  their  schools  that  the  Greeks  and %0a%3c Arabs  were  initiated  into  the  sacred  science,  the  revelation  of  the %0a%3c mysteries  of  which  was,  at  one  time,  punished  by  death. %0a%3c %0a%3c Theophilus,  who  informs  us  that  ''the  skilfulness  of  the  Gentiles %0a%3c in  this  art  is  probable,"  is  doubtless  alluding  to  the  Arab  alche- %0a%3c mists of  Spain,  who  at  an  early  period  pursued  the  sciences  ac- %0a%3c quired from  the  Greeks  and  Egyptians. %0a%3c %0a%3c The  process  which  Theophilus  describes  in  this  symbolic  lan- %0a%3c guage, appears  no  other  than  that  for  procuring  a  pure  gold  by  the %0a%3c means  of  the  mineral  acids.  Let  a  solution  of  gold  be  made  by %0a%3c nitro-muriatic  acid  and  copper  be  introduced,  the  latter  would  be %0a%3c dissolved  while  the  gold  would  re-appear,  but  in  a  state  of  purity, %0a%3c or,  as  the  alchemists  would  have  expressed  it,  the  copper  would %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c NOTES   TO    BOOK    III.  433 %0a%3c %0a%3c have  been  trantmuted  into  pure  gold,  "  donee  ipsa  confectio  cuprum %0a%3c transraordeat,  et  inde  pondus  et  colorem  auri  suscipiat." %0a%3c %0a%3c We  have  already  seen  that  the  ancients  were  aware  of  the  action %0a%3c upon  metals  of  substances  calculated  to  produce  the  mineral  acids %0a%3c in  the  art  of  refining,  and  that  the  Arab  alchemists  have  described %0a%3c these  acids  in  unequivocal  terms.— Numbers»  letters,  the  signs  of %0a%3c the  zodiac,  animals,  plants  and  organic  substances,  form  the  sym- %0a%3c bolic vocabulary  of  the  alchemists  of  this  period.

The  pictures  brought %0a%3c from  Rome  by  Biscops,  during  the  papacy  of  John  V.,  a.d.  686, %0a%3c appear,  as  stated  by  Bede,  to  have  been  of  this  class.     **  Imagines %0a%3c %0a%3c »  Pliny,  L  88,  C.  4. %0a%3c %0a%3c '  A  pyz,  of  the  eleyenth  oentnry,  was  lately  shown  me,  ornamented  in  thi^ %0a%3c manner. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c N0TB8  TO   BOOK  III.  435 %0a%3c %0a%3c quoque  ad  ornandum  monasteriam  ecclesiamque  Beati  Pauli  nostri, %0a%3c de  Concordia  Veteris  et  Novi  Testamenti  sunama  ration^  conipo- %0a%3c sitas,  exhibuit.

LXI. %0a%3c %0a%3c "  You  will  adapt  to  each  Apostle  a  corresponding  prophet,  that %0a%3c their  testimonies  may  agree,"  writes  Theophilus. %0a%3c %0a%3c Our  author,  who,  it  has  been  seen,  wrote  for  the  provision  of %0a%3c the  ceremonies  of  the  Roman  church,  is  anxious  that  this  early %0a%3c branch  of  Christian  iconography  should  not  be  neglected.  Theo- %0a%3c philus has  afforded  us  so  few  points  by  whicfi  we  may  be  enabled  to %0a%3c trace  the  period  at  which  he  wrote,  that  these  few  words,  hitherto %0a%3c neglected,  should  certainly  be  considered  if  at  all  bearing  upon  that %0a%3c question. %0a%3c %0a%3c Mons.  Didron,  who  has  paid  as  much,  if  not  more,  attention  to %0a%3c the  history  of  Christian  art  as  any  author,  and  whose  researches  in %0a%3c Greece  have  so  qualified  him  for  judging  upon  this  branch  of %0a%3c archaeology  that  his  opinion  may  be  accepted  as  authority,  de- %0a%3c clares that  the  higher  we  mount  into  the  history  of  Christianity, %0a%3c the  more  we  find  the  Judaic  influence  prevail.  **  The  western %0a%3c church,  in  France  in  particular,  ended  by  withdrawing  itself  from %0a%3c this  Oriental  embrace,  but  traces  of  it  are  found  in  the  most %0a%3c ancient  of  our  monuments  and  liturgy."  St.  Moses,  St.  Samuel, %0a%3c St.  Daniel,  St.  EHas,  St.  Jeremiah^  St.  Isaiah,  all  the  holy  patri- %0a%3c archs, prophets,  and  teachers  of  the  law,  figure  in  the  ancient %0a%3c litanies.  "  In  the  cathedral  of  Strasburg,  upon  the  ancient  glass, %0a%3c some  of  which  dates  even  from  the  eleventh  century,  Isaiah  is %0a%3c seen  with  the  nimbus,  like  a  saint  of  the  New  Testament.  Stras- %0a%3c burg," he  adds,  '*  is  German,  and  Germany  owes  much  to  Byzan- %0a%3c tium. The  Greek  Church  honours  the  saints  of  the  Old  Testa- %0a%3c ment as  much  as  those  of  the  New,  therefore  the  patriarchs^ %0a%3c prophets,  judges,  and  kings  of  Judah,  occupy  an  important  place %0a%3c in  the  Byzantine  paintings." %0a%3c %0a%3c In  the  public  library  at  Amiens  is  a  manuscript  believed  to  be %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c NOTES    TO    BOOK    III.  437 %0a%3c %0a%3c of  the  ninth  century,  but  which,  says  M.  Didron,  is  certainly  an- %0a%3c terior to  the  schism  consummated  by  Michael  Cerularius ;  it  is  a %0a%3c book  of  psalms.  At  the  end  of  the  MS.  is  a  prayer^  a  litany  where %0a%3c all  the  orders  of  saints,  apostles,  &c.,  are  successively  invoked. %0a%3c Immediately  after  the  angels  and  before  the  apostles  the  patriarchs %0a%3c and  prophets  are  one  by  one  invoked.  Saint  Abraham,  St.  Moses, %0a%3c St.  Aaron,  St.  Samuel,  St.  David,  St.  Amos,  St.  Habbacuc,  &c. %0a%3c But  in  the  eleventh  century  this  fraternization  ceased,  and  the  re- %0a%3c spect which  had  until  then  existed  in  the  Roman  church  for  these %0a%3c personages  diminished,  the  Latins  '*  became  rather  disdainful  of %0a%3c the  Old  Testament." %0a%3c %0a%3c Theophilus,  who  gives  few  iconographical  descriptions,  by  his %0a%3c careful  directions  for  a  practice,  by  which  the  prophets  of  the  Old %0a%3c and  the  apostles  of  the  New  Testaments  are  fraternized,  should %0a%3c have  lived  at  latest  in  the  commencement  of  the  eleventh  century  ^ %0a%3c %0a%3c C.  LXIII.     CALAMINE. %0a%3c %0a%3c The  calamine  or  cadmia  of  the  ancients,  which  Pliny  tells  was %0a%3c used  in  the  manufacture  of  brass,  ''  lapis,  ex  quo  fit  ass,  cadmia %0a%3c vocatur,"  ^  is  the  rough  zinc  ore ;  Dioscorides  informs  us  that  cad- %0a%3c mia is  produced  during  the  calcination  of  brass,  and  that  it  attaches %0a%3c itself  upon  the  sides  of  the  furnace'^ %0a%3c %0a%3c *  This  respect,  which  the  Roman  church  gradoallj  lost  for  the  holy  characters  of %0a%3c the  Old  Testament,  and  which  M.  Didron  designates  as  the  "  Judaic  influence,"  has %0a%3c been  perpetuated  amongst  us  in  England,  which  has  also  otherwise  been  so  strongly %0a%3c impressed  by  the  Byzantine  genius. %0a%3c %0a%3c Our  finest  Gothic  cathedrals  are  upon  the  plan  of  the  double  or  Greek  cross ;  our %0a%3c liturgy  greatly  imbued  with  the  writings  of  the  Greek  Fathers. %0a%3c %0a%3c I  insert  a  note  of  the  learned  M.  Durand,  -upon  the  effect  of  Jewish  and  Byzan- %0a%3c tine  influence  upon  England.  It  is  singular,  that  no  sooner  does  a  Frenchman  ap- %0a%3c proach any  subject  with  which  England  is  connected,  than  his  ideas  seem  to  run  riot. %0a%3c There  is,  however,  some  truth  in  the  following.  "  The  names  of  Adam,  Isaac, %0a%3c Jacob,  Abraham,  Moses,  David,  Solomon,  &c.,  are  very  common  in  Greece ;  there  is %0a%3c Jew  in  all  that.  It  would  seem  that  Byzantium,  nearer  than  Rome  to  Jerusalem %0a%3c and  the  Holy  Land,  has  not  been  sufficiently  capable  of  escaping  firom  the  Old  Testar- %0a%3c ment.  What  it  it  proper  to  remark  u,  that  England,  Jewish  hy  commerce,  is  Jewish %0a%3c and  Byzantine  in  her  religious  customs,  JSentham  is  called  Jeremiah ;  Reynold, %0a%3c Joshua  ;  Newton,  Isaac  ;  Oarrick,  David  ;  0*Connell  is  called  Daniel.  St  George, %0a%3c the  patron  of  Greece,  and  to  whom  the  patriarchal  church  at  Constantinople  is  dedi- %0a%3c cated, is  patron  of  England.  England  gives  this  name  to  the  branch  of  the  sea %0a%3c which  separates  her  from  Ireland.     The  celebrated  Canning  vus  coiled  Georges.** %0a%3c %0a%3c »  PUny,  Hist.  Nat.

By  this  would  be  intended  an %0a%3c engraved  work,  varied  with  plain  surfaces.  It  has  been  called %0a%3c "  Anaglypha  Scriptura,*'  carved  work.  Muratori  thought  that  it %0a%3c applied  only  to  the  species  of  engraving  in  the  manner  of  seals. %0a%3c "  Quo  nomine  opinor,  non  omnem  cselaturam  designari,  sed  earn %0a%3c tan  turn,  quae  incidendo  figuras  effbrroabat,  ut  est  in  sigillis.'*  (V. %0a%3c ft,  p.  360.)  Theophilus,  in  designating  this  as  Arabian  work,  has %0a%3c caused  Emeric  David  ^  and  M.  de  TEscalopier'  to  think  that  the %0a%3c word  interrasilis  means  Damascus  work,  "  damasquinure"  or  the %0a%3c threaded  gold  or  silver  work  seen  upon  the  sabres,  pistols,  cui- %0a%3c rasses, &c.,  of  the  east  We  fortunately  possess  a  chapter  in  this %0a%3c MS.  in  which  this  latter  art  is  carefully  detailed ;  the  damascine %0a%3c work  is  described  in  one  of  the  chapters  hitherto  unknown,  C.  90. %0a%3c %0a%3c The  opus  interrasilis,  then,  is  an  engraved  or  sculptured  plate, %0a%3c the  plain  grounds  of  which  are  cut  out  with  the  chisel,  or  **mei£el," %0a%3c in  the  German.

"  DE  ORGANIS." %0a%3c %0a%3c It  will  be  seen  that  the  Harleian  MS.  of  Theophilus  enriches %0a%3c the  archaeologist  with  three  new  chapters  upon  the  construction  of %0a%3c the  organ^  which  seems  in  the  time  of  our  author  to  have  been  of  a %0a%3c simple  construction. %0a%3c %0a%3c David,  in  the  cl.  Psalmi  speaks  of  the  organ,  which  does  not %0a%3c appear  to  have  become  known  to  Western  Europe  until  the  year %0a%3c 757,  when  one  was  sent  as  a  present  to  Pepin-le*Bref,  by  the  Em- %0a%3c peror Gonstantine  Copronymos. %0a%3c %0a%3c In  a  rare  Saxon  manuscript  of  the  eleventh  century, — Cotton, %0a%3c Tiberius,  B.  6,  page  18,  is  a  drawing  of  the  "  bumbulum  cum  fis- %0a%3c tula serea,"  with  brass  pipe ;  also  another  description  of  "  brass %0a%3c bumbula,  with  the  pipes  placed  in  the  middle,  three  bumbula %0a%3c placed  on  every  side."  This  Bumbulum  appears  to  be  an  organ, %0a%3c which  is  sounded  by  withdrawing  the  stops,  being,  at  the  organs %0a%3c of  Theophilus,  unfurnished  with  keys.  The  pipes  are  of  very %0a%3c thin  and  pure  copper. %0a%3c %0a%3c In  a  notice  of  the  "  Church  of  the  Holy  Cross,"  at  Binstead,  Isle %0a%3c of  Wight,  by  Mr.  Withers — (Weale's  Quarterly  Papers  .on  Archi- %0a%3c tecture, Midsummer,  1845^)  which  church  is  of  early  Norman  erec- %0a%3c tion, a  recess  in  the  wall  on  the  north  side  of  the  chancel  remains %0a%3c unexplained,  as  that  gentleman  states  that  no  traces  exist  on  the %0a%3c outside  wall  to  show  that  a  sacristy  has  ever  existed  there.  Simi» %0a%3c lar  recesses  are  found  in  our  early  Norman  churches  elsewhere, %0a%3c one  in  the  church  at  Beaulieu,  Hampshire,  if  I  am  not  mistaken. %0a%3c %0a%3c A  probable  solution  of  the  use  to  which  these  recesses  were  ap- %0a%3c plied is  found  in  the  83  C.  *'  Si  volueris  organa  ultra  maceriam %0a%3c muri  stabilire,  ita  ut  infra  monasterium  nihil  appareat,"  &c.  They %0a%3c were  for  the  purpose  of  a  proper  arrangement  of  the  organ  and  the %0a%3c seat  of  the  organist,  at  that  time  the  chanter  also. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 440  NOTB8  TO    BOOK   III. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c C.

Four  parts  of  copper  and  a  fifth  of  tin  form %0a%3c the  composition  of  the  bell-metal.  Four  openings  are  made  near %0a%3c the  neck,  "that  it  may  sound  better, — ut  melius  tinniat" — this %0a%3c precaution  is  often,  in  our  day,  neglected. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c CC.

David,  in  the  c1.  Psalm,  speaks %0a%3c of  the  loud  cymbals  and  the  high  sounding  cymbals. %0a%3c %0a%3c The  cymbal  was  discontinued  upon  the  improvement  of  the %0a%3c mechanism  of  the  organ,  which,  however,  still  possesses  traces  of %0a%3c of  the  ancient  accompaniment  of  that  instrument,  one  part  being %0a%3c divided  into  the  great  and  second  cymbal. %0a%3c %0a%3c The  alloy  of  the  cymbals  of  Theophilus  is  about  a  fifth  or  sixth %0a%3c part  of  pure  tin  to  one  of  pure  copper. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c C.

"  Should  you  wish  to  bend  ivory  and  ornament %0a%3c it"  Take  sulphate  of  potass,  (glumen  roiundum  \)  fossil  salt,  (sal %0a%3c gemma,  muriate  of  soda,)  and  vitriol,  (calcanthum,  sulphate  of %0a%3c copper,)  these  are  ground  with  very  sharp  vinegar  in  a  brass  mortar. %0a%3c Into  this  mixture  the  ivory  is  placed  for  three  days  and  nights. %0a%3c This  being  done,  you  will  hollow  out  a  piece  of  wood,  as  you %0a%3c please.  The  ivory  being  then  placed  in  the  hollow  you  direct  it, %0a%3c and  will  bend  it  to  your  will. %0a%3c %0a%3c In  the  MS.  Sloane,  416,  p.  40,  already  quoted,  is  a  similar  re- %0a%3c cipe, with  the  addition  that  these  matters  are  to  be  distilled  in %0a%3c equal  parts,  (per  alembicum,)  this  would  yield  muriatic  acid,  with %0a%3c the  presence  of  water ;  the  MS.  adds  that  "  infused  in  this  water %0a%3c half  a  day,  ivory  is  made  so  soft  that  it  can  be  cut  like  wax. %0a%3c And  when  you  wish  it  hardened,  place  it  in  white  vinegar  and  it %0a%3c becomes  hard." %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c C.

RUBRICA. %0a%3c %0a%3c The  rubrica,  or  rubea  radix,  was  the  i  pt/d^^avo»  of  the  Greeks ; %0a%3c the  red  root,  or  madder. %0a%3c %0a%3c Walnut  oil  is  here  alluded  to  as  used  in  the  arts  for  the  purpose %0a%3c of  preserving  ornaments  in  ivory. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c C.

"  CHRIST ALLUM."    . %0a%3c %0a%3c That  crystal  was  a  stone  produced  by  the  long  continued  action %0a%3c of  cold  upon  water  is  but  the  opinion  of  Pliny,  perpetuated  by %0a%3c our  author.  "  Contraria  huic  causa  crystallinum  facit,  gelu  vehe- %0a%3c mentiore  concreto.  Non  aliubi  cert^  reperitur,  quam  ubi  maxim^ %0a%3c hybernae  nives  rigent :  glaciemque  esse  certum  est :  unde  et  nomen %0a%3c Graeci  dedere."

Isca,  which  I  have  rendered  tinder,  properly  meant  the %0a%3c pith,  or  '%3c  medulla"  of  plants,  which  was  also  used  for  the  ready %0a%3c production  of  fire. %0a%3c %0a%3c "  Ismaris  lapis  "  I  have  translated  **  emery,"  as  the  £/A»f ^  x/Oo^  of %0a%3c Dioscorides  and  Hesychius,  anciently  known  for  eutting  and %0a%3c polishing  gems. %0a%3c %0a%3c C.

DE  LACCA. %0a%3c %0a%3c The  lake  of  the  Greeks,  probably  so  called  from  Xaxxo^,  a  hollow^ %0a%3c or  cut,  was  made,  Eraclius  and  our  author  inform  us,  by  making %0a%3c an  incision  in  the  ivy  in  spring,  and  boiling  the  sap,  which  exudes, %0a%3c with  urine. %0a%3c %0a%3c The  "  phoenix  color,"  or  phcenicia,  or  fenicon,  is  a  red  or  rosy %0a%3c colour,  probably  made  from  the  oster,  and  the  Tyrian  red ;  for %0a%3c which  this  lake  was  substituted. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c C.

CANDIDUM  SULPHUR. %0a%3c %0a%3c The  "  three  kinds  of  sulphur,  white^  black,  and  yellow,"  men- %0a%3c tioned by  our  author,  L.  1.  c.  36,  were  not  always  the  metal %0a%3c Sulphur  in  various  states  of  purity. %0a%3c %0a%3c The  "  pompholyx  "  of  the  ancients,  which  was  produced  by  the %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c NOTES   TO    BOOK    III.  443 %0a%3c %0a%3c calcination  (in  a  close  vessel  fitted  with  an  upper  chamber)  of %0a%3c brass  or  of  calamine,  appears  to  have  been  the  white  sulphur  of %0a%3c the  Byzantines  and  Arabs.  Both  these  substances  generally  con- %0a%3c tained arsenic^  the  volatilization  of  which,  with  that  of  the  zinc, %0a%3c would  produce  a  mixture  of  the  oxides  of  arsenic  and  zinc ;  the %0a%3c deposition  in  the  lower  chamber,  of  a  darker  colour  and  less  pure, %0a%3c were  combinations  of  the  zinc  with  other  substances,  accord- %0a%3c ing to  the  nature  of  the  ore  calamine  employed,  and  was  called %0a%3c •podium  \ %0a%3c %0a%3c Geber  tells  us  that  "  arsenic  is  composed  of  subtle  matter,  and  is %0a%3c of  the  nature  of  sulphur ;  it  h  fixed  by  the  metals,  like  sulphur,  and %0a%3c like  it  is  produced  by  the  calcination  of  the  metals : "  (is  not  this %0a%3c the  white  sulphur  of  the  Greeks  ?)  '*  Therefore  it  is  not  proper  to %0a%3c be  classed  (diffiniri)  otherwise  than  sulphur."^ %0a%3c %0a%3c Albertus  Magnus,  whose  writings  are  in  great  measure  a  re^ %0a%3c sumi  of  the  Greek  and  Arab  chemists,  tells  us  that  brass  will %0a%3c yield  arsenic ;  '*  sbs  expirabit  arsenicum."^ %0a%3c %0a%3c The  Oifor  Xft;xo»,  white  sulphur,  was  that  which  produced  white %0a%3c brass:  Olympiodorus  knew  that  arsenic  gave  a  white  colour  to %0a%3c copper,  and  he  calls  it  a  kind  of  sulphur  which  is  volatilized  by  the %0a%3c action  of  fire.     MS,  2250,  Bib,  Ro^ale,  Par. %0a%3c %0a%3c Richardus  Anglicus,  who  appears  to  have  been  contemporaneous %0a%3c with  Roger  Bacon,  tells  us  that  '*  white  sulphur  fixes  (coagulat) %0a%3c quicksilver  ;"  he  adds  that  "  there  is  no  sulphur  in  silver  but  the %0a%3c white  sulphur."^ %0a%3c %0a%3c An  impure  mixture  of  oxide  of  arsenic  with  zinc  or  tin,  would, %0a%3c mixed  with  white  glass,  yield  an  opaque  flux,  proper  for  painting %0a%3c on  earthenware. %0a%3c %0a%3c D£   MIXTURA  COLORUM. %0a%3c %0a%3c Maftizabis,  a  Romaic  term  from  "  Mappa,"  a  drawings  or %0a%3c picture. %0a%3c %0a%3c >  Pliny.
