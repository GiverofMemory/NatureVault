The first %0aglance tells us that the book is one on which the leisure of a busy lifetime and the whole %0a%0aresources of an enthusiastic author have been lavished without stint.This work is a %0a%0akind of British Museum for this period and subject in small compass. It is a series of %0agalleries of statues, gems, coins, documents, letters, books, and relics, through which the %0areader may wander at leisure, and which he may animate with his own musings and reflec¬ %0ations. It must be remembered throughout that this delightful and instructive collection is %0athe result of the devotion of a lifetime, and deserves as much honour and recognition as %0amany a museum or picture-gallery which has preserved its donor’s name for generations.” %0a— Times. %0a%0a%0aLONDON : GEORGE BELL & SONS, YORK STREET, COVENT GARDEN- %0a%0aii %0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0aSTANDARD WORKS 1'UBLISUED BY %0a%0a%0aILLUSTRATED OR POPULAR EDITIONS OF %0aSTANDARD WORKS. %0a%0aDante’s Divine Comedy.

In turning over the charmingly executed hand- %0acoloured plates of British plants which encumber these volumes with riches, the reader %0acannot help being struck with the beauty of many of the humblest flowering weeds we tread %0aon with careless step. We cannot dwell upon many of the individuals grouped in the %0a-plendid bouquet of flowers presented in these pages, and it will be sufficient to state that %0athe work is pledged to contain a figure of every wild flower indigenous to these isles.”— %0aTimes. %0a%0a“ Will be the most complete Flora of Great Britain ever brought out. This great work %0awill find a place wherever botanical science is cultivated,* and the study of our native %0aplants, with all their fascinating associations, held dear.”— Athenaum. %0a%0a“ A clear, bold, distinctive type enables the reader to take in at a glance the arrangement %0aand divisions of every page. And Mrs. Lankester bas added to the technical description by %0athe editor an extremely Interesting popular sketch, which follow’s in smaller type. The %0aEnglish, French, and German popular names are given, and, wherever that delicate and %0adifficult step is at all practicable, their derivation also. Medical properties, superstitions, %0aand fancies, and poetic tributes and illusions, follow. In short there is nothing more left to %0abe desired.”— Guardian. %0a%0a“ Without question, this is the standard work on Botany, and indispensable to every %0abotanist. . . . The plates are mo-t accurate and beautiful, and the entire work cannot be %0atoo strongly recommended to all who are interested in botany .’’—Illustrated News. %0a%0a%0aSold separately, prices as follows ;— %0a%0a.

There is a mortal %0afeud 4 existing also between the cabbage and the vine; and the %0acabbage itself, so shunned as it is by the vine, will wither im¬ %0amediately if planted in the vicinity of cyclamen 6 or of origanum. %0aWe find it asserted even, that aged trees fit to be felled, are %0acut with all the greater difficulty, and dry all the more rapidly, %0a%0a1 See B. xvi. cc. 6, 8, 33, 50. 2 See B. xvii. c. 3. %0a%0a3 As Fee justly remarks, tlie greater part of these so-called sympathies %0aand antipathies must be looked upon as so many fables. In the majority of %0ainstances, it is the habitual requirements of the tree or plant that con¬ %0astitute the difference ; thus, for instance, the oak or quercus requires a %0adifferent site and temperature from that needed by the olive, and the stony %0asoil adopted by the vine is but ill-suited for the cultivation of the cabbage. %0a%0a1 See B. xx. c. 36. %0a%0a5 See B. xxi. cc. 27, 38, and B. xxv. c. 67. %0a%0aVOL. V. %0a%0a%0aB %0a%0a%0a%0a2 pliny’s natural HISTORY. [Book XXIV. %0a%0aif touched by the hand of man before the axe is applied : it %0ais a common belief, too, that when their load consists ot fruit, %0abeasts of burden are immediately sensible 5 6 of it, and will in¬ %0astantly begin to sweat, however trifling it may be, unless the %0afruit is duly shown to them before starting, Fennel-giant, as %0aa fodder, is extremely grateful to the ass, and yet to other beasts %0aof burden it is a deadly poison : hence it is that the ass is con¬ %0asecrated to Father Liber , 1 * to which deity the fennel is also %0asacred. %0a%0aInanimate objects again, even of the most insignificant %0acharacter, have their own peculiar antipathies. Cooks dis¬ %0aengage meat of the brine, when it has been too highly salted, %0aby the agency of fine meal and the inner bark 6 of the linden- %0atree. Salt again, tends to neutralize the sickly flavour of food %0awhen over-sweet. The taste of water, when nitrous or bitter, %0ais modified by the addition of polenta , 9 so much so indeed, as %0ato be rendered potable 10 in a couple of hours : it is fora similar %0areason, too, that a layer of polenta is put 11 * in our linen wine- %0astrainers. A similar property is possessed also by the chalk 13 %0aof Rhodes, and the argilla of our own country. %0a%0aEqual affinities exist as well; pitch, for instance, is extracted %0aby the agency of oil, both of them being of an unctuous nature : %0aoil again, will incorporate only with lime, both of them having %0aa natural antipathy 13 to water. Gum is most 14 easily removed %0awith vinegar, and ink 15 with water; in addition to which, there %0a%0a5 See the same statement made in B. xxiii. c. 62. %0a%0a7 Or Bacchus. %0a%0a8 “Philyra.” Fee does not think that it can be of any use for such a %0a%0apurpose. Hardouin says, however, that in his time meat when too highly %0a%0asalted was wrapped in leaves of the lime or linden, for the purpose of ex¬ %0atracting the salt. 9 See B. xviii. c. 14 %0a%0a10 Instead of having this effect, Fee says, it would render it much worse. %0a%0a11 The intention being to clear the wine, though in reality, as Fee ob¬ %0a%0aserves, it would have a tendency to turn the wine into vinegar. %0a%0a13 Chalk, or in other words, sub-carbonate of lime, and argilla, or %0aaluminous earth combining several earthy salts, would probably neutralize %0athe acetic acid in the wine, but would greatly deteriorate its flavour. %0a%0a13 On the contrary, lime would appear to have a great affinity for water, %0aabsorbing it with avidity, if we may use the term. %0a%0a14 More easily with water ; though vinegar will do for the purpose. %0a%0a15 “ Atramentum.” By this passage, Fee says, it is clearly proved that %0athe ink of the ancients was soluble in water, arid that it contained neither %0agalls nor salts of iron. What it really was made of is still a matter of %0a%0a%0aChap. 2.] %0a%0a%0aTHE LOTUS or ITALY. %0a%0a%0a3 %0a%0a%0aare numberless other instances of sympathy and antipathy %0awhich we shall be careful to mention in their appropriate places. %0a%0aIt is in tendencies of this description that the medical art %0afirst took its rise; though it was originally intended, no doubt, %0aby Nature, that our only medicaments should be those which %0auniversally exist, are everywhere to be found, and are to be %0aprocured at no great outlay, the various substances, in fact, from %0awhich we derive our sustenance. But at a later period the %0afraudulent disposition of mankind, combined with an ingenuity %0aprompted by lucre, invented those various laboratories , 16 in %0awhich each one of us is promised an extension of his life—that %0ais, if he will pay for it. Compositions and mixtures of an in¬ %0aexplicable nature forthwith have their praises sung, and the %0aproductions of Arabia and India are held in unbounded ad¬ %0amiration in the very midst 11 of us. For some trifling %0asore or other, a medicament is prescribed from the shores %0aof the Red Sea ; while not a day passes but what the real %0aremedies are to be found upon the tables of the very poorest %0aman among us . 18 But if the remedies for diseases were %0aderived from our own gardens, if the plants or shrubs were %0aemployed which grow there, there would be no art, forsooth, %0athat would rank lower than that of medicine. %0a%0aYes, avow it we must—the Roman people, in extending its %0aempire, has lost sight of its ancient manners, and in that we %0ahave conquered we are the conquered : 19 for now we obey the %0anatives of foreign 20 lands, who by the agency of a single art have %0aeven out-generalled our generals . 21 More, however, on this %0atopic hereafter. %0a%0aCHAP. 2. (2.) -THE LOTUS OF ITALY : SIX REMEDIES. %0a%0aWe have already 22 spoken in their appropriate places of the %0a%0adoubt; but it is not improbable that the basis of it was spodium, or ashes %0aof ivory. 16 “ Officinas.” %0a%0a17 “ in medio.” The reading is very doubtful here. %0a%0a18 This, of course, is mere exaggeration. . %0a%0a18 He would seem to imply that the medical men of his age had conspired %0ato gain an adventitious importance by imposing upon the credulity of the %0apublic, on the principle “ Omne ignotum pro magnifico ; much as the %0a“ medicine-men ” of the North American Indians do at the present day. %0a%0a20 He alludes to the physicians of Greece more particularly. %0a%0a21 “ Imperatoribus quoque imperaverunt.” %0a%0a22 In B. xiii. c. 32, and B. xvi. c. 53. Pliny ascribes here to the Lotus of %0aItaly, the Celtis Australis of Linnaeus, the same medicinal properties that %0a%0a" B 2 %0a%0a%0a4 %0a%0a%0aPLINY’s NATURAL HISTORY. %0a%0a%0a[Book XXIV. %0a%0a%0aherb called lotus, and of the plant of Egypt known by the %0asame name and as the “tree of the Syrtes. -the berries^of %0athe lotus, which is known among us as the “ Grecian bean, 23 %0aact astringently upon the bowels; and the shavings of the wood, %0aboiled in wine, are useful in cases of dysentery, excessive %0amenstruation, • vertigo, and epilepsy: they also prevent the %0ahair from falling off. It is a marvellous thing—but there is no %0asubstance known that is more bitter than the shavings of this %0awood, or sweeter than the fruit.

A decoction of %0athis last is good for cceliac affections; and it is applied topically %0ain cases of dysentery, as well as the acorns, which are em¬ %0aployed also for the treatment of stings inflicted by serpents, %0afluxes, and suppurations. The leaves, acorns, and bark, as %0awell as a decoction prepared from them, are good as counter- %0apoisons. A decoction of the bark, boiled in cows’ milk, is %0aused topically for stings inflicted by serpents, and is adminis¬ %0atered in wine for dysentery.

These substances %0aremove fleshy excrescences on the body, and are serviceable for %0aaffections of the gums and uvula , 31 and for ulcerations of the %0amouth. Burnt, and then quenched in wine, they are applied %0atopically in cases of coeliac affections and dysentery, and with %0ahoney, to whitlows, hang-nails, malformed nails, running ulcers, %0acondylomatous swellings, and ulcerations of the nature known as %0aphagedamic . 32 A decoction of them in wine is used as an injection %0afor the ears, and as a liniment for the eyes, and in combination %0awith vinegar they are employed for eruptions and tumours. %0a%0aThe inner part of the gall, chewed, allays tooth-ache, and is %0agood for excoriations between the thighs, and for burns. Taken %0aunripe in vinegar, they reduce the volume of the spleen; and, %0aburnt and then quenched in salt and vinegar, they are used as %0a%0afomentation for excessive menstruation and procidence of %0athe uterus. All varieties of the gall-nut stain the hair black. %0a%0aCHAP. 6.-MISTLETOE : ELEVEN REMEDIES. %0a%0aWe have already 33 stated that the best mistletoe is that %0awhich grows on the robur , 31 and have described the manner in %0a%0aare hypothetical. It is no longer used in medicine, at least to any re¬ %0acognized extent. %0a%0a28 Hence the Latin word “ vermiculum,” from which our word “ ver¬ %0amilion” is derived. %0a%0a29 In B. xvi. c. 12. 30 In B. xvi. c. 9. %0a%0a31 They might be used advantageously, Fee thinks, in the shape of a %0adecoction, for procidence of the uvula and uterus. %0a%0a3 - “ Eating,” or “corrosive.” 33 See B. xvi. cc. 11, 93, 94. %0a%0a31 See B. xvi. cc. 10, 11. %0a%0a%0a%0a%0apliny’s natural history. %0a%0a%0a[Book XXIV. %0a%0a%0awhich it is prepared. Some persons, after bruising the berries, %0aboil them in water, till nothing appears on the surface, while %0aothers, again, bite the berries with the teeth, and reject the %0askins . 35 The best kind of viscus is that which has none of %0athe outer skin in it, is extremely light, yellow without, ami %0aof a leek-green colour within. There is no substance more %0aglutinous than this: it is of an emollient nature, disperses %0atumours, and acts as a desiccative upon scrofulous sores; com¬ %0abined with resin and wax, it heals inflamed swellings of every %0adescription. Some persons add galbanum as well, using equal %0aproportions of eacli ingredient, and this preparation they em¬ %0aploy also for the treatment of wounds. %0a%0aThe viscus of the mistletoe has the additional property also %0aof rectifying malformed nails; but to effect this it must be %0ataken off at the end of seven days, and the nails must be %0awashed with a solution of nitre. 33 * Some persons have a sort of %0asuperstitious notion that the viscus will be all the more effi¬ %0acacious if the berries are gathered from the robur at new moon, %0aand without the aid of iron. They have an impression too, %0athat if it has not touched the ground, it will cure epilepsy, 3 * %0athat it wflll promote conception in females if they make a %0apractice of carrying it about them: the berries, chewed and %0aapplied to ulcers, are remarkably efficacious for their cure, it is %0asaid. %0a%0aCHAP. 7.-THE EXCRESCENCES WHICH GROW ON THE ROBUR: %0a%0aONE REMEDY.

A %0adecoction 39 of them, used as a fomentation, strengthens suck %0aparts of the body as are paralyzed ; and it is a very good plan %0a%0a35 This passage, as Fee remarks, is somewhat obscure. %0a%0a35 ‘ As to the identity of the “ nitrum” of Plinv, see B. xxxi. cc. 22,46. %0a%0a36 Fee says, that till very recently it was a common belief that the oak %0amistletoe is curative of epilepsy. It was also employed as an ingredient %0ain certain antispasmodic powders. %0a%0a37 See B. xvi. c. 10. 3S g ee j{ xv j c g %0a%0a39 This decoction would be of a tonic and astringent nature, owin'’ to %0athe tannin and gallic acid which the leaves and bark contain. * %0a%0a%0aChap. 10.] %0a%0a%0aTHE CYPRESS. %0a%0a%0ato employ it as a sitting-bath, for its desiccative or astringent %0aeffects upon the lower extremities.

A liniment is made of the ashes of beech- %0amast for urinary calculus, and, in combination with honey, for %0aalopecy. %0a%0aCHAP. 10.—THE CYPRESS: TWENTY-THREE REMEDIES. %0a%0aThe leaves of the cypress 43 are pounded and applied to %0awounds inflicted by serpents, and with polenta, to the head, in %0acases of sunstroke. They are used also for hernia, and an infu¬ %0asion of them is taken in drink . 44 They are applied with wax to %0aswellings of the testes, and mixed with vinegar they stain the %0ahair black . 46 Beaten up with twice the quantity of light %0abread, and then kneaded with Aminean 46 wine, they are found %0avery soothing for pains in the feet and sinews. %0a%0aThe excrescences of this tree are taken in drink for the %0astings of serpents and for discharges of blood from the mouth ; %0athey are used also as a topical application for gatherings. %0aTresh-gathered and beaten up with axle-grease and bean- %0ameal, they are good for hernia; and an infusion of them is %0a%0a40 See B. xvi, c. 13. 41 “Ex utralibet parte.’’ %0a%0a42 There is no foundation, Fee says, for any of these statements. %0a%0a43 See B. xvi. c. 60. The leaves of the cypress, Fee says, contain tan¬ %0anin and an essential oil; all the medicinal properties therefore, here attri¬ %0abuted to them, which are not based upon these principles, must be looked %0aupon as hypothetical. %0a%0a44 Down to the present century the leaves and fruit of the cypress were %0arecommended in some medical works for the cure of hernia. The juice, %0ahowever, of the leaves, taken internally, would be, as Fee says, highly %0adangerous. %0a%0a45 Owing probably to the gallic acid they contain. %0a%0a46 See B. xiv. c. 4. %0a%0a%0a8 %0a%0a%0apliny’s natural history. %0a%0a%0a[Book XXIV. %0a%0a%0ataken in drink for the same complaint. In combination with %0ameal, they are applied topically to imposthumes of the parotid %0aglands, and to scrofulous sores. From these excrescences, %0apounded along with the seed, a juice is extracted, w'hich, mixed %0awith oil, disperses films of the eyes. Taken in doses of one %0avictoriatus , 47 in wine, and applied at the same time in a pulpy, %0adried fig, the seeds of which have been removed, this juice %0acures maladies of the testes and disperses tumours: mixed %0awith leaven, it heals scrofulous sores. %0a%0aThe root of the cypress, bruised wdth the leaves and taken %0ain drink, is curative of diseases of the bladder, strangury, and %0athe sting of the phalangium . 48 The shavings of the wood, %0ataken in drink, act as an emmenagogue, and neutralize the %0avenom of the scorpion. %0a%0aCHAP. 11.-THE CEDAR *. THIRTEEN REMEDIES. %0a%0aThe larger cedar, known as the “ cedrelates ,” 49 produces a %0apitch called “ cedria,” which is very useful for tooth-ache, it %0ahaving the effect of breaking 50 the teeth and extracting them, %0aand so allaying the pain. We have already 51 stated how the %0ajuices of cedar are extracted, so remarkably useful for %0aseasoning books , 52 were it not for the head-ache they produce. %0aThis extract from the cedar preserves 53 the bodies of the %0adead uncorrupted for ages, but exercises a noxious effect upon %0athe bodies of the living—singular that there should be such a %0adiversity in its properties, taking away life from animated %0a%0a47 See Introduction to Vol. III. %0a%0a48 See B. x. c. 28, and B. xi. cc. 24, 28. 49 See B. xiii. c. 11. %0a%0a50 Fee remarks, that many of the modems attribute to frankincense the %0aproperties here ascribed to cedria; a most unfounded notion, he thinks. %0a%0a51 In B. xiv. c, 25, and B. xvi. cc. 21, 22. %0a%0a52 Sillig reads “ voluminain which case it is not improbable that the %0aallusion is to the practice of seasoning the paper of manuscripts with a %0apreparation of cedar, as a preservative against mildew and worms. An¬ %0aother reading is “ lumina,” and it is not impossible that it is the right one, %0ameaning that pitch of cedar is useful for making lamps or candles. Fee %0areminds us that we are not to confound the “ cedria ” with the “ cedrium ” %0aof B. xvi. c. 21, though Pliny seems here to confound the two. See Note %0a38 to that Chapter. %0a%0a53 As in B. xvi. c. 21, he has said the same of “cedrium,” a red tar %0acharged with empyreumatic oil, it is clear that he erroneously identifies it %0awith “ cedria,” or pitch of cedar. It is with this last, in reality, that the %0aEgyptians embalmed the dead, or rather preserved them, bv dipping them %0ain the boiling liquid. %0a%0a%0aChap. 12.] %0a%0a%0aCEDRIDES. %0a%0a%0a9 %0a%0a%0abeings, and imparting a sort of life, as it were, to the dead ! %0aIt injures clothing also and destroys 54 animal life. It is for %0athis reason that I cannot recommend it to be taken internally for %0athe cure of quinzyand indigestion, though there are some who %0aadvise it: I should be greatly in dread too, to rinse the teeth %0awith it, in combination with vinegar, for tooth-ache, or to use %0ait as an injection for the ears in cases of hardness of hearing, or %0afor worms in those organs. There is one very marvellous story %0atold about it—if the male organs, they say, are rubbed with it %0ajust before the sexual congress, it will effectually prevent im¬ %0apregnation . 55 %0a%0aStill, however, I should not hesitate to employ it as a fric¬ %0ation for phthiriasis or porrigo. It is strongly recommended %0aalso, in raisin wine, as an antidote to the poison of the sea- %0ahare , 58 but I should be more ready to use it as a liniment for %0aelephantiasis. Some authors have prescribed it as an oint¬ %0ament for foul ulcers and the fleshy excrescences which grow %0ain them, as also for spots and films on the eyes; and have re¬ %0acommended it to be taken, in doses of one cyathus, for ulcera¬ %0ations of the lungs, and for tapeworm. %0a%0aThere is an oil extracted from this pitch, known as “ pis- %0aselaeon ,” 57 the properties of which are of increased activity %0afor all the purposes before-mentioned. It is a well-known %0afact that the saw-dust of cedar will put serpents to flight, %0aand that a similar effect is produced by anointing the body %0awith the berries 53 bruised in oil. %0a%0aCHAP. 12 . -CEDRIDES: TEX REMEDIES. %0a%0aCedrides, or in other words, the fruit of the cedar , 59 is %0acurative of coughs, acts as a diuretic, and arrests looseness of %0athe bowels.

It is applied with %0ahoney also, to ulcerations of the head. In combination with %0aoil of roses or with nard, it is used as an injection for sup¬ %0apurations of the ears; and the odour of it is useful for epilepsy, %0ahysterical suffocations, and faintness at the stomach. Em¬ %0aployed as a pessary or as a fumigation, it brings away the %0afoetus in cases of miscarriage; branches too of hellebore %0acovered with it and laid beneath the patient, have a similar %0aeffect. %0a%0aWe have already 64 stated that serpents are driven away by %0athe fumes of burnt galbanum, and they will equally avoid %0apersons whose body has been rubbed with it. It is curative %0aalso of the sting of the scorpion. In protracted deliveries, a %0apiece of galbanum the size of a bean is given in one cyathus %0aof wine : it has the effect also of reducing the uterus when %0adisplaced, and, taken with myrrh and wine, it brings away %0athe dead foetus. In combination with myrrh and wine too, %0ait neutralizes poisons — those which come under the de¬ %0anomination of “toxica ” 65 in particular. The very touch %0aof it, mixed with oil and spondylium , 66 is sufficient to %0akill a serpent . 67 It is generally thought to be productive of %0astrangury. %0a%0a60 See Note 56 above.

(6.)-HAMMONIACUM: TWENTY-FOUR REMEDIES. %0a%0aOf a similar nature to galbanum is hammoniacum, a tear¬ %0alike gum, the qualities of which are tested in manner already 68 %0astated. It is of an emollient, warming, resolvent, and dis- %0apellent nature. Employed as an ingredient in eye-salves, it %0aimproves the sight. It disperses prurigo, effaces the marks of %0asores, removes spots in the eyes, and allays tooth-ache, more %0aparticularly when burnt. It is very useful too, taken in %0adrink, for hardness of breathing, pleurisy, affections of the %0alungs, diseases of the bladder, bloody urine, maladies of the %0aspleen, and sciatica: employed in a similar manner, it acts as %0aa purgative upon the bowels. Boiled with an equal proportion %0aof pitch or wax, and with oil of roses, it is good for diseases of %0athe joints, and for gout. Employed with honey it ripens hard %0atumours, extracts corns, and has an emollient effect upon in¬ %0adurations. In combination with vinegar and Cyprian wax, %0aor oil of roses, it is extremely efficacious as a liniment for %0aaffections of the spleen. In cases of extreme lassitude, it is %0aan excellent plan to use it as a friction, with vinegar and oil, %0aand a little nitre. %0a%0acnAP. 15 . —storax: ten remedies. %0a%0aIn speaking too of the exotic trees, we have made mention 69 of %0athe properties of storax. In addition to those which we have %0aalready mentioned, it ought to be very unctuous, without alloy, %0aand to break to pieces in whitish fragments. This substance is %0acurative of cough, affections of the fauces, diseases of the chest, %0aand obstructions or indurations of the uterus. Taken in drink, %0aor employed as a pessary, it acts as an emmenagogue ; it has a %0alaxative effect also upon the bowels. I find it stated that, taken %0ain moderate doses, storax dispels melancholy; but that when em¬ %0aployed in large quantities, it promotes it. Used as an injection %0ait is good for singings in the ears, and employed as a friction, %0afor scrofulous swellings and nodes of the sinews. It neutra¬ %0alizes poisons of a cold nature, and consequently, hemlock . 70 %0a%0a68 In B. xii. c. 49.

Combined %0awith old oil, it is taken in drink for affections of the liver, %0ajaundice, epilepsy, hardness of breathing, and hysterical %0asuffocations, maladies for which it is equally serviceable in the %0ashape of a fumigation. It relaxes the bowels, and with rue it %0ais applied to ulcers of a serpiginous nature. The juice, which %0ais extracted from the blossom is a most useful injection for %0asuppurations of the ears; but the moment it is extracted it %0ashould be covered up, as flies and other insects of a similar %0anature are remarkably fond of it. %0a%0aScrapings of the root, introduced into the interior of fistulas, %0ahave a caustic effect upon their callosities ; and they are some¬ %0atimes used, in combination with the juice, as an injection for %0athe ears.

The ashes of %0athe bark are used for excoriations and burns. Taken in drink %0athis substance arrests diarrhoea, and acts as a diuretic; and %0aused as a fumigation, it reduces the uterus when displaced. %0aThe leaves of the pitch-tree are particularly good for the liver, %0ataken in doses of one drachma in hydromel. %0a%0aIt is a well-known fact that forests planted solely with trees %0afrom which pitch and resin are extracted, are remarkably %0abeneficial for patients suffering from phthisis , 77 or who are un¬ %0aable to recover their strength after a long illness: indeed it is %0asaid, that in such cases to breathe the air of localities thus %0aplanted, is more beneficial even than to take a voyage to Egypt , 78 %0aor to go on a summer’s journey to the mountains to drink the %0amilk there, impregnated with the perfumes of plants. %0a%0aCHAP. 20. -THE CHAMJSPITTS : TEN REMEDIES. %0a%0aThe chamoepitys , 79 called in Latin “ abiga ,” 80 because it %0apromotes abortion, and known to some as “ incense of the %0aearth ,” 81 has branches a cubit in length, and the odour and %0a%0a75 See B. xvi. c. 18. %0a%0a76 See B, xvi. c. 19. The leaves of these trees are of an astringent %0aand acid nature, Fee says, but they are no longer employed in medicine. %0aAll that Pliny here states relative to them is very problematical. %0a%0a77 Fee says that it is still the practice of the Turkish physicians to re¬ %0acommend to their patients the air of the cypress groves of Candia. Fie %0astates also, that it is a very general supposition that resins, balms, and bal¬ %0asams are good for pulmonary phthisis, but is of opinion that the notion is %0afounded upon no solid basis. %0a%0a78 See B. xxxi. c. 33, also Celsus, B. iii, c. 22.

Another variety 82 of it, which is some- %0awhat shorter, has all the appearance of being bent 85 down¬ %0awards; and there is a third, 84 which, though it has a similar %0asmell, and consequently the same name, is altogether smaller, %0awith a stem the thickness of one's linger, and a diminutive, %0arough, pale leaf: it is found growing in rocky localities. All %0athese varieties are in reality herbaceous productions ; but in %0aconsequence of the resemblance of the name, 85 1 have thought %0ait as well not to defer the consideration of them. %0a%0aThese plants are good for stings inflicted by scorpions, and %0aare useful as an application, mixed with dates or quinces, for %0amaladies of the liver: a decoction of them with barley-meal %0ais used for the kidneys and the bladder. A decoction of them %0ain water is used also for jaundice and for strangury. The %0akind last mentioned, in combination with honey, is good for %0awounds inflicted by serpents, and a pessary is made of it, with %0ahoney, as a detergent for the uterus. Taken in drink it brings %0aaway coagulated blood, and rubbed upon the body it acts as a %0asudorific : it is particularly useful also for the kidneys. Pills %0aof a purgative nature are made of it for dropsy, with figs. 86 %0aTaken in wine, in doses of one victoriatus, 87 it dispels lumbago, %0aand cures coughs that are not of an inveterate description. %0aA decoction of it in vinegar, taken in drink, will instantaneously %0abring away the dead foetus, it is said. %0a%0aCHAP. 21 .- THE PITYTJSA : SIX REMEDIES. %0a%0aFor a similar 88 reason, too, we shall accord the same dis¬ %0atinction to the pityusa, a plant which some persons reckon %0aamong the varieties of the tithymalus. 89 It is a shrub, 90 re- %0a%0a82 The Teucrium chamaepitys of Linnaeus, the Chamaepityslutea vulgaris %0aof C.

A decoction of the root, taken in doses of %0aone hemina, carries off the bilious and pituitous secretions by 91 %0astool, and a spoonful of the seed, used as a suppository, has a %0asimilar effect. A decoction of the leaves in vinegar removes %0a6ca'ly eruptions of the skin; and in combination with boiled %0arue, it effects the cure of diseases of the mamillae, gripings in %0athe bowels, wounds indicted by serpents, and incipient gather¬ %0aings of most kinds. %0a%0achap. 22.—resins : twenty-two remedies. %0a%0aIn treating, first of wines, 92 and then of trees, 93 we have %0astated that resin is the produce of the trees above-mentioned, %0aand have described the several varieties of it, and the countries %0ain which they are respectively produced. There are two %0aprincipal kinds of resin, the dry and the liquid. 93 * The dry %0aresins are extracted from the pine 94 and the pitch-tree, 95 the %0aliquid from the terebinth, 96 the larch, 97 the lentisk, 98 and the %0acypress these last producing it in the province of Asia and %0ain Syria. It is an error' to suppose that the resin of the pitch- %0atree is the same as that of the larch; for the pitch-tree yields %0aan unctuous 2 resin, and of the same consistency as frankin¬ %0acense, while that of the larch is thin, like honey in colour, and %0aof a powerful odour. It is but very rarely that medical men %0amake use of liquid resin, and when they do, it is mostly that %0aproduced by the larch, which is administered in an egg for %0a%0aThe characteristics of it differ, however, from the description here given %0ahy Pliny. It is no longer used in medicine, though, like the other Euphor- %0abiacece, it has very active properties. %0a%0a91 This, Fee says, is consistent with truth. %0a%0a92 In B. xiv. c. 25. 93 B. xvi. cc. 16, 21, 22, 23. %0a%0a93 * Or, as they are called at the present day, the resins, and the oleo- %0aresins, or terebinthines. %0a%0a94 Fee thinks that this name extends to the numerous species of resin- %0aiferous trees. 95 The Abies excelsa of Linnaeus. %0a%0a96 The Pistacia terehinthus; see B. xiii. c. 12. It yields a valuable %0aturpentine, known in commerce as that of Cyprus or Chios. %0a%0a97 The so-called Venice turpentine is extracted from the larch. %0a%0a98 It yields mastich solely, a solid resin. %0a%0a99 It yields a terebinthine, and a very diminutive amount of solid resin. %0a%0a1 Fee says, that if the same methods are employed, the same products %0a%0amay be obtained, though in general the larch yields the better terebinthine. %0a%0a3 Fee thinks that he is speaking of a thick resin, or galipot, as the %0aFrench call it, of the consistency of honey. %0a%0a%0a16 %0a%0a%0apliny’s natural nisxoaT. %0a%0a%0a[Book XXIV %0a%0a%0acough and ulcerations of the viscera. The resin of the pine, %0atoo, is far from extensively used, and that ot the other kinds %0ais always boiled 3 before use : on the various methods of boiling %0ait, we have enlarged at sufficient length already. 4 %0a%0aAs to the produce of the various trees, the resin of the tere¬ %0abinth is held in high esteem, as being the most odoriferous and %0athe lightest, the kinds 6 which come from Cypt’us and Syria %0abeing looked upon as the best. Both these kinds are the %0acolour of Attic honey ; but that of Cyprus has more body, and %0adries with greater rapidity. In the dry resins the qualities %0arequisite are whiteness, purity, and transparency : but what¬ %0aever the kind, the produce of mountainous 6 districts is always %0apreferred to that of champaign countries, and that of a north¬ %0aeastern aspect to that of any other quarter. Itesins" are dis¬ %0asolved in oil as a liniment and emollient cataplasm for wounds; %0abut when they are used as a potion, bitter almonds 8 are also %0aemployed. The curative properties of resins consist in their %0atendency to close wounds, to act as a detergent upon gatherings %0aand so disperse them, and to cure affections of the chest. %0a%0aThe resin of the terebinth * * * it is used too, warmed, %0a%0aas a liniment for pains in the limbs, the application being re¬ %0amoved after the patient has taken a walk in the sun. Among %0aslave-dealers too, there is a practice of rubbing the bodies of %0athe slaves with it, which is done with the greatest care, as a %0acorrective for an emaciated appearance ; the resin having the %0aproperty of relaxing the skin upon all parts of the body, and %0arendering it more capable of being plumped out by food. 9 %0a%0aNext after the resin of the terebinth comes that of the %0a%0a3 Boiled terebinthine, or turpentine, is still used, Fee says, in medicine; %0athat process disengaging the essential oil. %0a%0a4 In B. xvi. c. 22. %0a%0a5 Fee thinks that in reality these are terebinthines, and not resins. %0a%0a6 It has been generally remarked that aromatic plants grown on moun¬ %0atains have a stronger perfume than those of the plains ; Fee queries whether %0athis extends to the resins. %0a%0a7 Though of little importance in modern medicine, resins and terebin¬ %0athines are still employed as the basis of certain plasters and other prepara¬ %0ations. %0a%0a8 Such a potion as this, F ee says, would but ill agree with a person in %0arobust health even. %0a%0a9 There would be no necessity whatever, Fee says, for such a process, a %0aplentiful supply of food being quite sufficient for the purpose. Galen %0arecommends frictions of terebinthine for the improvement of The health. %0a%0a%0aChap. 23.] %0a%0a%0aPITCH. %0a%0a%0a17 %0a%0a%0alentisk: 10 it possesses astringent properties, and is the most %0apowerful diuretic of them all. The other resins are laxative %0ato the bowels, promote the digestion of crudities, allay the %0aviolence of inveterate coughs, and, employed as a fumigation, %0adisengage the uterus of foreign 11 bodies with which it is sur¬ %0acharged : they are particularly useful too as neutralizing the %0aeffects of mistletoe ; and, mixed with bull suet and honey, %0athey are curative of inflamed tumours and affections of a similar %0anature. The resin of the lentisk is very convenient as a ban¬ %0adoline for keeping stubborn eyelashes in their place : it is %0auseful also in cases of fractures, suppurations of the ears, and %0aprurigo of the generative organs. The resin of the pine is the %0abest of them all for the cure of wounds in the head. %0a%0aCHAP. 23 . ( 7 .) —PITCH : TWENTY-THREE REMEDIES. %0a%0aWe have also stated on a previous occasion 13 from what %0atree pitch is extracted, and the methods employed for that %0apurpose. Of this also there are two kinds; thick pitch and %0aliquid pitch. 13 Of the several varieties of thick pitch the %0amost useful for medicinal purposes is that of Bruttium ; u for %0abeing both extremely unctuous and very resinous, it reunites %0athe properties both of resin and of pitch, that of a yellow %0areddish colour being the most highly esteemed. As to the %0astatement made in addition to this, that the produce of the %0amale tree is the best, I do not believe that any such distinc¬ %0ation is at all possible. %0a%0aPitch is of a warming, cicatrizing tendency: mixed with %0apolenta it is particularly useful as a neutralizer of the venom %0aof the cerastes, 16 and in combination with honey it is used %0afor quinzy, catarrhs, and fits of sneezing caused by phlegm. %0aWith oil of roses it is used as an injection for the ears, and %0aemployed as a liniment with wax it heals lichens. It relaxes 16 %0athe bowels, also, and used as an electuary, or applied with %0a%0a10 Mastich. The medicinal properties here attributed to it.

Mixed with raisins and axle-grease, it %0aforms a detergent plaster for carbuncles and putrid ulcers, and, %0awith pine-bark or sulphur, for serpiginous sores. Pitch has %0abeen administered too by some, in doses of one cyathus, for %0aphthisis and inveterate coughs. It heals chaps of the feet and %0arectum, inflamed tumours, and malformed nails ; and used as a %0afumigation, it is curative of indurations and derangements of %0athe uterus, and of lethargy. Boiled with barley-meal and the %0aurine of a youth who has not arrived at puberty, it causes %0ascrofulous sores to suppurate. Dry pitch is used also for the %0acure of alopecy. For affections of the mamillse, Bruttian %0apitch is warmed in wine with fine spelt meal, and applied as %0ahot as can be borne. %0a%0aCHAP. 24 . -PISSELiEON AND PAL1MPISSA I SIXTEEN REMEDIES. %0a%0aWe have already 17 described the way in which liquid pitch %0aand the oil known as pisselmon are made. Some persons boil %0athe pitch over again, and give it the name of “ palimpissa.” 18 For %0aquinzy 19 and affections of the uvula, liquid pitch is employed %0ainternally. It is used also for the cure of ear-ache, for the %0aimprovement of the sight, and as a salve for the lips; and is %0aemployed for hysterical suffocations, inveterate coughs, profuse %0aexpectorations, spasms, nervousness, opisthotony, paralysis, %0aand pains in the sinews. It is a very excellent remedy too for %0aitch in dogs and beasts of burden. %0a%0aCHAP. 25 . -PISSASPHALTOS : TWO REMEDIES. %0a%0aThere is pissasphaltos too, a natural production of the %0aterritory of the Apolloniates, 20 and consisting of pitch mixed %0a%0a17 In B. xvi. c. 22, and B. xv. c. 7. %0a%0a18 “Pitch boiled over again.” %0a%0a19 Fee says, that this statement is quite beyond all belief. Indeed there %0ais little doubt that tar taken internally for quinzy, would only tend to %0aaggravate the complaint. He states that a solution of tar in water is some¬ %0atimes used internally with success for pulmonary phthisis. Bishop %0aBerkeley wrote his Siris, on the virtues of Tar-water as a medicament, %0ahaving been indebted to it for his recovery from an attack of colic. %0a%0a20 See B. xvi. c. 23. His description here is faulty, it being solely a %0anatural pitch or mineral bitumen, without any admixture of vegetable %0apitch.

The gum of %0athis tree is useful for diseases of the rectum, and all cases in %0awhich desiccatives and calorifics are needed; a decoction too %0aof the gum is good for the stomach, acting as a carminative %0a%0abitumen. The names now given to it are mineral pitch, and malthe or %0apitch of Malta. %0a%0a21 In B. xvi. c. 23. Fee thinks that the use of it is more likely to %0ahave been injurious than beneficial. %0a%0a22 Or tasda. See B. xvi. c. 19. %0a%0a23 Fee says, that within the last century, the wood of the lentisk or %0amastich, and the oil of its berries, figured in the Pharmacopoeias. Their %0amedicinal properties are far from energetic, but the essential oil may pro¬ %0abably be of some utility as an excitant. %0a%0a24 This property is still attributed in the East to the leaves and resin of %0atbe lentisk. We learn from Martial, B. xiv. Epig. 22, that the wood of %0atbe lentisk, as well as quills, was used for tooth-picks. %0a%0a15 This, Fee says, is not the fact. %0a%0a%0a20 %0a%0a%0aplint’s natural history. %0a%0a%0a[Book XXIV. %0a%0a%0aand diuretic; it is applied also to the head, in cases of head¬ %0aache, with polenta.

It is employed for spitting ot blood and for inveterate %0acoughs, as well as all those purposes for which gum acacia is %0ain request. It is used also for the cure ot excoriations ; which %0aare fomented either with the oil extracted from the seed, %0amixed with wax, or else with a decoction of the leaves in %0aoil. Fomentations too are made of a decoction of it in water %0afor diseases of the male organs. 28 I know for a fact, that in %0athe illness of Considia, the daughter of M. Servilius, a per¬ %0asonage of consular rank, her malady, which had long resisted %0aall the more severe methods of treatment, was at last success¬ %0afully treated with the milk of goats that had been fed upon the %0aleaves of the lentisk. %0a%0achap. 29.

Pounded with strong vinegar, squill vinegar %0ain particular, they arrest haemorrhage of every kind ; and %0awith the addition of honey, they remove freckles, carcino¬ %0amatous sores, and black spots of long standing on the skin. %0a%0aThe leaves again, and the bark of this tree, are used in the %0aform of liniments for gatherings and suppurations, and a %0adecoction of them is employed for a similar purpose.

They have the property, too, of diminish¬ %0aing obesity, and of gradually reducing the body to a state of %0acomparative emaciation, 31 the follicules being pounded in %0awine and administered in proportion to the bodily strength; %0athus, for instance, to a child, live of them are given in three %0acyathi of wine, but for persons in more robust health, seven %0aare prescribed, in live cyathi of wine. %0a%0aWe must not omit to state that the shavings and saw-dust %0aof this wood are of a highly dangerous nature, according to %0asome. %0a%0aCHAP. 31 . —THE MAPLE : ONE REMEDY. %0a%0aThe root of the maple, 35 beaten up in wine, is extremely %0aefficacious as a topical application for pains in the liver. %0a%0aCHAP. 32 . -THE POPLAR : EIGHT REMEDIES. %0a%0aWc have already 36 mentioned, when speaking of the un¬ %0aguents, the use that is made of the berries 37 of the white %0apoplar.

The bark, in %0adoses of one denarius, taken in one hemina of cold water, acts %0aas a purgative upon the bowels, and is particularly useful for %0acarrying off pituitous and aqueous humours. The gum also %0awhich this tree produces is applied topically to gatherings, %0awounds, and burns, which it would be as well to foment with %0athe decoction also. The moisture 44 which is secreted on %0athe follicules of the tree gives a finer colour to the skin, %0aand improves the looks. The foot-stalks of the leaves that %0afirst appear, 45 boiled in wine, are curative of tumours, and %0a%0a38 See also c. 38, as to the Yitex. %0a%0a39 This superstition probably applies to persons riding on horseback. %0a%0a10 “ Guttam.” This is the substance known to us as “ honey-dew.” %0aIt is either secreted by the plant itself, or deposited on the leaves by an %0aaphis.

The leaves, %0ahowever, are the only part that is made use of for ulcers upon %0ainfants ; chewed, too, or employed in the form of a decoction, %0athey are diuretic. TJsed as a liniment they arrest menstruation %0awhen in excess, and an infusion of them, taken in diink, cairies %0aoff superfluous blood. %0a%0a%0aCHAP. 35. -THE ELDER 1 FIFTEEN REMEDIES. %0a%0aThere are two kinds of elder, one of which grows wild and %0ais much smaller than the other; by the Greeks it is known as %0athe “ chammacte,” or “ helion.” 49 A decoction of the leaves, 60 %0aseed, or root of either kind, taken in doses of two cyathi, in %0aold wine, though bad for the upper regions of the stomach, %0acarries off all aqueous humours by stool. This decoction is %0avery cooling too for inflammations, those attendant upon recent %0aburns in particular. A poultice is made also of the more %0a%0a%0a« “ Extrahuntque per fistulas.” %0a%0a*8 See B. xvi. c. 25. The blossoms of the linden-tree are the only part %0aof it employed in modern medicine. Fee thinks, with Hardouin, that %0aPliny has here attributed to the linden, or Philyra of the Greeks, the pro¬ %0aperties which in reality were supposed to belong to the Phillyrea latifolia, %0aa shrub resembling the wild olive.

The berries, which have not so power¬ %0aful an action as the other parts of the tree, stain the hair. %0aTaken in doses of one acetabulum, in drink, they are diuretic. %0aThe softer leaves are eaten with oil and salt, to carry oft %0apituitous and bilious secretions. %0a%0aThe smaller kind is for all these purposes the more efficacious %0aof the two. A decoction of the root in wine, taken in doses %0aof two cyathi, brings away the water in dropsy, and acts %0aemolliently upon the uterus: the same effects are produced %0aalso by a sitting-bath made of a decoction of the leaves. %0aThe tender shoots of the cultivated kind, boiled in a saucepan %0aand eaten as food, have a purgative effect: the leaves taken in %0awine, neutralize the venom of serpents. An application of %0athe young shoots, mixed with he-goat suet, is remarkably good %0afor gout; and if they are macerated in water, the infusion will %0adestroy fleas. If a decoction of the leaves is sprinkled about %0aa place, it will exterminate flies. “ Boa ” 61 is the name given %0ato a malady which appears in the form of red pimples upon %0athe body ; for its cure the patient is scourged with a branch of %0aelder.

The shingles is %0aprobably the malady meant. %0a%0a52 Fee speaks of a decoction of the inner bark as having been recently %0a%0ain vogue for the cure of dropsy. ’ %0a%0a53 This so-called cedar, Fee says, isin reality itself a juniper. The medici¬ %0anal properties of all the varieties of the juniper are not identical. Theessen- %0atial oil of the leaves acts with a formidable energy upon the human system. %0a%0a^ This is identified by Fee with the Juniperus communis of Lamarck, %0avariety a, the Juniperus communis of Linnmus. %0a%0a55 Identified by Fee with the Juniperus nana of Willdenow the Juni¬ %0aperus communis of Lamarck, variety /3.

Ap¬ %0aplied topically, it checks the growth of tumours ; and the %0aberries, taken in red wine, act astringently upon the bowels : %0athey are applied also to tumours of the abdomen. The seed %0ais used as an ingredient in antidotes of an aperient nature, and %0ais diuretic 58 in its effects. It is used as a liniment for de¬ %0afluxions of the eyes, and is prescribed for convulsions, rup¬ %0atures, griping pains in the bowels, affections of the uterus, %0aand sciatica, either in a dose of four berries in white wine, or %0ain the form of a decoction of twenty berries in wine. %0a%0aThere are persons who rub the body with juniper berries as %0aa preventive of the attacks of serpents. %0a%0aCHAP. 37. (9.) -THE WILLOW : FOURTEEN REMEDIES. THF. %0a%0aWILLOW OF AMERIA: ONE REMEDY. %0a%0aThe fruit of the willow, 59 before it arrives at maturity, is %0acovered with a down like a spider’s web : gathered 60 before it %0ais ripe, it arrests discharges of blood from the mouth. The %0abark of the upper branches, reduced to ashes and mixed with %0awater, is curative of corns and callosities: it removes spots %0aalso upon the face, being still more efficacious for that purpose %0aif mixed with the juices of the. tree. %0a%0aThe juices produced by the willow form three different %0avarieties ; one 61 of which exudes in the shape of a gum from %0a%0a46 Virgil says this of the fumes of the cedar, Georg. III. 414; an %0aadditional proof, Fee says, that under the name of “ cedrus,” the juniper %0awas really meant. The smoke of the juniper is not known to have the %0aeffect upon serpents here described. %0a%0a57 The berries of the juniper contain sugar, mucilage, and a small pro¬ %0aportion of essential oil; a rob is prepared from them, Fee says, under the %0aname of “extract of juniper.” %0a%0a58 It is a well-known fact, that juniper berries are diuretic ; they impart %0aalso to the urine the odour of the violet, a property which is equally pos¬ %0asessed by turpentine. All the other properties here attributed to the %0ajuniper, are, in F£e’s opinion, either hypothetical or absurd. %0a%0a59 See B. xvi. c. 68. %0a%0a60 Neither this downy substance nor the seeds are now employed for %0aany purpose. The bark of the willow has some strongly-pronounced pro¬ %0aperties, but all other parts of it are totally inert. %0a%0a61 A kind of manna, Fee says. The other juices here mentioned are %0asecreted from the sap. %0a%0a%0a26 %0a%0a%0aFlint’s natural history. %0a%0a%0a[Book XXIV. %0a%0a%0athe tree itself, and another distils from an incision some three %0afingers in width, made in the bark while the tree is in blossom. %0aThis last is very useful for dispersing humours which impede %0athe sight, acting also as an inspissative when needed, promoting %0athe discharge of the urine, and bringing abscesses of all kinds %0ato a head. The third kind of juice exudes from the wounds, %0awhen the branches are lopt off w’ith the bill. Either of these %0ajuices, warmed in a pomegranate rind, is used as an injection %0afor diseases of the ears. The leaves, too, boiled and beaten %0aup with wax, are employed as a liniment for similar purposes, %0aand for gout. The bark and leaves, boiled in wine, form a %0adecoction that is remarkably useful as a fomentation for affec¬ %0ations of the sinews. The blossoms, bruised with the leaves, %0aremove scaly eruptions of the face; and the leaves, bruised and %0ataken in drink, check libidinous tendencies, 62 and effectually %0aput an end to them, if habitually employed. %0a%0aThe seed of the black willow of Ameria, 63 mixed with %0alitharge in equal proportions, and applied to the body just %0aafter the bath, acts as a depilatory. %0a%0aCHAT. 38.- THE VITEX : THIRTY-THREE REMEDIES. %0a%0aNot much unlike the willow, for the use that is made of it %0ain wicker-work, is the vitex, 64 which also resembles it in the %0aleaves and general appearance, though the smell of it is more %0aagreeable. The Greeks call it “ lygos,” or “ agnos,” 65 from %0athe fact that the matrons of Athens, during the Thesmo- %0aphoria, 66 a period w'hen the strictest chastity is observed, are %0ain the habit of strewing their beds with the leaves of this tree. %0a%0aThere are two species of vitex : the larger 67 one, like the %0awillow, attains the full proportions of a tree ; while the other, 66 %0awhich is smaller, is branchy, with a paler, downy leaf. The %0afirst kind, generally known as the “ white ” vitex, bears a %0a%0a63 The leaves have no effect whatever as an antaphrodisiac. %0a%0a03 See B. xvi. c. 69. %0a%0a64 The Vitex agnus castus of Linnaeus, the tree of chastity. %0a%0a65 The “chaste” tree. It is no longer used in medicine; the fruit has some¬ %0awhat the flavour of spice, Fee says, and taken internally it would have the %0aconverse of an antaphrodisiac effect. The other parts of it are quite inert. %0a%0a66 An Attic festival celebrated yearly in honour of Demeter, which %0alasted four or five days. It was also celebrated in other parts of Greece. %0a%0a67 The Vitex agnus castus of Lamarck, variety /3, Elatior. %0a%0a68 The Vitex agnus castus of Linnaeus, the type. %0a%0a%0aChap. 38.] %0a%0a%0aTHE VITEX. %0a%0a%0a7 %0a%0a%0awhite blossom mixed with purple, whereas the black one has a %0aflower that is entirely purple. Both of these trees grow on %0alevel spots of a marshy nature. %0a%0aThe seed of these trees, taken in drink, has a sort of vinous %0aflavour, and has the reputation of being a febrifuge. It is %0asaid also to act as a sudorific, if the body is rubbed with it %0amixed with oil, and to have the effect of dispelling extreme %0alassitude : it acts too as a diuretic 69 and emmenagogue. The %0aproduce of both trees is trying to the head, like wine, and %0aindeed the odour of them is very similar. They have the %0aeffect also of removing flatulence in the lower regions of the %0abody, act astringently upon the bowels, and are remarkably %0auseful for dropsy and affections of the spleen. They promote %0athe secretion of the milk, and neutralize the venom of serpents, %0awhen of a cold nature more particularly. The smaller kind, %0ahowever, is the more efficacious of the two for injuries inflicted %0aby serpents, the seed being taken in doses of one drachma, in %0awine or oxycrate, or else the more tender leaves in doses of two %0adrachmae. %0a%0aFrom both trees also a liniment is prepared for the bites of %0aspiders, but it is quite sufficient to rub the wounds with the %0aleaves; and if a fumigation is made from them, or if they are %0aspread beneath the bed, they will repel the attacks of all %0avenomous creatures. They act also as an antaphrodisiac, and %0ait is by this tendency in particular that they neutralize the %0avenom of the phalangium, the bite of which has an exciting %0aeffect upon the generative organs. The blossoms and young %0ashoots, mixed with oil of roses, allay head-aches arising from %0ainebriation. A decoction of the seed used as a fomentation %0acures head-ache, however intense it may be ; and employed as %0aa fumigation or as a pessary, the seeds acts as a detergent %0aupon the uterus. Taken in drink with honey and penny-royal, %0ait has a laxative effect; pounded and used with barley-meal, %0ait quickly brings abscesses and hard tumours to a head, and %0ahas an emollient effect. %0a%0aThe seed, in combination with saltpetre and vinegar, removes %0alichens and freckles; mixed with honey, it heals ulcers and %0aeruptions of the mouth ; applied with butter and vine-leaves, %0ait reduces swellings of the testes ; used with water, as a lini- %0a%0a69 It may possibly, Fee says, have tbis effect, but the other properties %0ahere attributed to it are wholly imaginary. %0a%0a%0a28 pliny’s natural htstory.

Persons 70 who carry a sprig of this plant in the %0ahand, or stuck in the girdle, will be proof, it is said, against %0achafing between the thighs. %0a%0achap. 39.—the erica; one remedy. %0a%0aThe Greeks give the name of “ erice,”' 1 to a shrub that is but %0alittle different from the myrice. 73 It has the colour, and very %0anearly the leaf, of rosemary. It neutralizes 73 the venom of %0aserpents, it is said. %0a%0achap. 40. —the broom; five remedies. %0a%0aThe broom is used for making withes ; 74 the flowers of it %0aare greatly sought by bees. I have my doubts whether this %0ais not the same plant that the Greek writers have called %0a“sparton,” and of which, in those parts of the world, as I have %0aalready 15 stated, they are in the habit of making fishing-nets. %0aI doubt also whether Homer 70 has alluded to this plant, when %0ahe speaks of the seams of the ships,—“ the sparta” coming %0aasunder; for it is certain that in those times the spartum 77 of %0aSpain or Africa was not as yet in use, and that vessels made %0aof materials sown together, were united by the agency, not of %0aspartum, but of flax. %0a%0a70 Travelling on horseback, probably. A similar superstition is mentioned %0aas to the poplar, in c. 32 of this Book. %0a%0a71 Probably the Erica arborea of Linnaeus ; see B. xiii. c. 35. It has %0anot, however, a leaf similar to that of rosemary, with the sole exception, %0aFee says, of the Erica cinerea of Linnaeus. %0a%0a72 See B. xiii. c. 37. 73 It has no such effect, in reality. %0a%0a74 See B. xvi. c. 69.

See B. xix. c. 6, where Pliny states it as his %0a%0aopinion that in this passage Homer is speaking of flax. %0a%0a77 See B. xix. c. 7. Fee thinks that the plant under consideration in %0athis Chapter is the Spanish broom, Genista juncea of Lamarck, the Spar- %0atium junceum of Linnaeus, a different plant from the Spartum of B. xix. %0ac. 7, the Stipa tenacissima of Linnaeus. He is of opinion also, that Homer %0ain the passage referred to alludes, not to flax, hut to the Genista j uncea. See %0athis question further discussed, in the additional Note at the end of B. xxvii. %0a%0a%0aChap. 41.] %0a%0a%0aTHK MYRICA. %0a%0a%0a29 %0a%0a%0aThe seed of the plant to which the Greeks now give the %0aname of “ sparton,” grows in pods like those of the kidney- %0abean. It is as strongly drastic 78 as hellebore, and is usually- %0ataken fasting, in doses of one drachma and a half, in four %0acyathi of hydromel. The branches also, with the foliage, are %0amacerated for several days in vinegar, and are then beaten up, %0athe infusion being recommended for sciatica, in doses of one %0acyathus. Some persons think it a better plan, however, to %0amake an infusion of them in sea-water, and to inject it as a %0aclyster. The juice of them is used also as a friction for sciatica, %0awith the addition of oil. Some medical men, too, make use %0aof the seed for strangury. Broom, bruised with axle-grease, is %0aa cure for diseases of the knees. %0a%0aCnAP. 41. —THE MYRICA, OTHERWISE CALLED TAMARICA, OR %0aTAMARIX : THREE REMEDIES. %0a%0aLenaeus says, that the myrice, 79 otherwise known as the %0a“ erica,” is a similar plant to that of which brooms are made at %0aAmeria. 80 He states also that, boiled in wine and then beaten %0aup and applied with honey, it heals carcinomatous sores. I %0awould here remark, parenthetically, that some persons identify %0ait with the tamarice. Be this as it may, it is particularly %0auseful for affections of the spleen, the juice of it being ex¬ %0atracted for the purpose, and taken in wine; indeed so marvellous, %0athey say, is its antipathy to this part of the viscera, and this %0aonly, that if swine drink from troughs made of this wood, 61 %0athey will be found to lose the spleen. Hence it is that %0a%0a18 Fee says that the blossoms and seed of the juncifovm genista and %0aother kinds are of a purgative nature; indeed, one variety has been called %0athe Genista purgans by Lamarck. None of them, however, are so potent %0ain their effects as Pliny in the present passage would lead us to suppose. %0a%0a79 See B. xiii. c. 37, and Note 96; where it is stated that, in Fee’s %0aopinion, several plants were united by the ancients under this one collective %0aname—brooms for instance, heaths, and tamarisks. He thinks, however, %0athat under the name “ Myrica,” Pliny may possibly have intended to com¬ %0aprehend the larger heaths and the Tamarix Gallica of Linnaeus. M. Fraas, as %0aLittle states, gives the Tamarix Africana as the probable synonym of the %0aMyrica of Pliny. %0a%0a8,1 Of this broom-plant of Ameria nothing is known. %0a%0a81 This cannot apply to any of the heaths of Europe. The tamarisk %0agrows to a much larger size, and barrels and drinking vessels are made of %0athe wood. %0a%0a%0a30 pliny’s natural history. [Book XXIV. %0a%0ain maladies of the spleen victuals and drink are given to the %0apatient in vessels made of this wood. %0a%0aA medical author too, of high repute, 8 ' has asserted that a %0asprig broken from off this tree, without being allowed to touch %0athe earth or iron, will allay pains in the bowels, if applieu to %0athe body, and kept close to it by the clothes and girdle. The %0acommon people, as already 83 stated, look upon this tree as ill- %0aomened, because it bears no fruit, and is never propagated %0afrom seed. %0a%0aCHAP. 42. -THE BRYA : TWENTY-NINE REMEDIES. %0a%0aAt Corinth, and in the vicinity of that city, the Greeks give %0athe name of “ brya” 81 to a plant of which there are two %0avarieties ; the wild brya, 85 which is altogether barren, and the %0acultivated one. 86 This last, when found in Syria and Egypt, %0aproduces a ligneous fruit, somewhat larger than a gall-nut, in %0agreat abundance, and of an acrid flavour; medical men employ %0ait as a substitute for galls in the compositions known as %0a“ anther®.” 87 The wood also, with the blossoms, leaves, and %0abark of the tree, is used for similar purposes, but their pro¬ %0aperties are not so strongly developed. The bark is pounded %0aalso, and given for 88 discharges of blood from the mouth, irre¬ %0agularities of the catamenia, and coeliac affections : beaten up %0aand applied to the part affected, it checks the increase of all %0akinds of abscesses. %0a%0aThe juice too is extracted from the leaves for similar pur¬ %0aposes, and a decoction is made of them in wine; they are ap¬ %0aplied also to gangrenes, in combination with honey. A de¬ %0acoction of them taken in wine, or the leaves themselves ap¬ %0aplied with oil of roses and wax, has a sedative effect: it is in %0athis form that they are used for the cure of epinyctis. This %0adecoction is useful also for tooth-ache or ear-ache, and the root %0a%0a82 “ Gravis.” He does not, however, show his gravity in the present in¬ %0astance. 83 In B. xvi. c. 45. %0a%0a84 See B. xiii. c. 37. %0a%0a85 Identified by Fee with the Tamarix Gallica. %0a%0a86 The “brya,” spoken of in B. xiii. c. 37, as growing in Achaia also, %0athe Tamarix orientalis of Delille.

The leaves too have this %0aadditional use—they are applied with polenta to serpiginous %0asores. The seed, in doses of one drachma, is administered in %0adrink for injuries inflicted by spiders or the phalangium; and %0amixed with the grease of poultry, it is applied to boils. It is %0avery efficacious also for stings inflicted by all kinds of ser¬ %0apents, the asp excepted. The decoction, used as a fomentation, %0ais curative of jaundice, phthiriasis, and lice; it also arrests %0athe catamenia when in excess. The ashes of the tree are %0aemployed for all these purposes; there is a story told, too, %0athat, mixed with the urine of an ox, and taken in the food or %0adrink, they will act most effectually as an antaphrodisiac. %0aThe charcoal too of this wood is quenched in urine of a similar %0anature, and kept in a shady spot. When it is the intention of %0athe party to rekindle the flames 89 of desire, it is set on fire %0aagain.

THIRTY-NINE %0a%0aREMEDIES. %0a%0aWe have already 95 enumerated some twenty varieties of the %0aivy. The medicinal properties of them all are of a doubtful %0anature; taken in considerable quantities they disturb the %0amental faculties and purge the brain. Taken internally they %0aare injurious to the sinews, 96 but applied topically they are %0abeneficial to those parts of the body. Ivy possesses properties %0asimilar 91 to those of vinegar. All the varieties of the ivy are %0aof a refrigerative nature, and taken in drink they are diuretic. %0aThe softer leaves, applied to the head, allay head-ache, acting %0amore particularly upon the brain and the membrane which %0aenvelopes that organ. For this purpose the leaves are bruised %0awith vinegar and oil of roses and then boiled, after which some %0amore rose-oil is added. The leaves too are applied to the fore- %0a%0a93 See B. xii. c. >51. The botanical characteristics, Fee says, and the %0amedicinal properties of the privet, differ essentially from those of theCypros %0aor Lawsonia inermis. The leaves of the privet are bitter and astringent. %0a%0a91 Fee says, that on reading this passage it is impossible to preserve one's %0agravity. %0a%0a95 In B. xvi. c. 62. The ivy is but little used for any of the purposes %0aof modern medicine.

They are useful also for %0athe spleen, the leaves being applied topically, or an infusion %0aof them taken in drink. A decoction of them is used for %0acold shiverings in fevers, and for pituitous eruptions ; or else %0athey are beaten up in wine for the purpose. The umbels too, %0ataken in drink or applied externally, are good for affections of %0athe spleen, and an application of them is useful for the liver ; %0aemployed as a pessary, they act as an emmenagogue, %0a%0aThe juice of the ivy, the white cultivated kind more par¬ %0aticularly, cures diseases of the nostrils and removes habitually %0aoffensive smells. Injected into the nostrils it purges the head, %0aand with the addition of nitre it is still more efficacious for that %0apurpose. In combination with oil, the juice is injected for %0asuppurations or pains in the ears. It is a corrective also of the %0adeformities of scars. The juice of white ivy, heated with the %0aaid of iron, is still more efficacious for affections of the spleen; %0ait will be found sufficient, however, to take six of the berries in %0atwo cyathi of wine. Three berries of the white ivy, taken in %0aoxymel, expel tape-worm, and in the treatment of 6uch cases %0ait is a good plan to apply them to the abdomen as well. %0aErasistratus prescribes twenty of the golden-coloured berries of %0athe ivy which we have-mentioned as the “ chrysocarpos,” 96 to be %0abeaten up in one sextarius of wine, and he says that if three %0acyathi of this preparation are taken for dropsy, it will carry off %0aby urine the water that has been secreted beneath the skin. %0aFor cases of tooth-ache he recommends five berries of the %0achrysocarpos to be beaten up in oil of roses, and warmed in a %0apomegranate-rind, and then injected into the ear opposite the %0aside affected. The berries which yield a juice of a saffron %0acolour, taken beforehand in drink, are a preservative against %0acrapulence ; they are curative also of spitting of blood and of %0agriping pains in the bowels. The whiter umbels of the black %0aivy, taken in drink, are productive of sterility, in males even. %0aA decoction in wine of any kind of ivy is useful as a liniment %0afor all sorts of ulcers, those even of the malignant kind known %0aas “ cacoethes.” The tears" which distil from the ivy are used %0a%0a98 “ Golden fruit.” See B. xvi. c. 62. %0a%0a99 The same substance which he speaks of at the end of this Chapter as %0athe gum of ivy, called “ hederine,” Fee says, in modern chemistry.

I find it stated too, %0athat patients suffering from affections of the spleen are cured %0aby drinking from vessels made of the wood of the ivy. The %0aberries are bruised also, and then burnt, and a liniment is %0aprepared from them for burns, the parts being fomented with %0awarm -water first. %0a%0aIncisions are sometimes made in the ivy to obtain the juice, %0awhich is used for carious teeth, it having the effect of breaking %0athem, it is said ; the adjoining teeth being fortified with wax %0aagainst the powerful action of the juice. A kind of gum even %0ais said to be found in the ivy, which, it is asserted, is extremely %0auseful, mixed with vinegar, for the teeth. %0a%0aCHAP. 48.-THE CISTHOS 1 FIVE REMEDIES. %0a%0aThe Greeks give the name of “ cisthos”—a word very %0asimilar to “ cissos,” the Greek name of the ivy—to a plant %0awhich is somewhat larger than thyme, and has a leaf like that %0aof ocimum. There are two varieties of this plant ; the male, 1 %0awhich has a rose-coloured blossom, and the female, 2 with a %0awhite one. The blossom of either kind, taken in astringent %0aw r ine, a pinch in three fingers at a time, is good for dysentery %0aand looseness of the bowels. Taken in a similar manner %0atwice a day, it is curative of inveterate ulcers: used with %0awax, it heals burns, and employed by itself it cures ulcer¬ %0aations of the mouth. It is beneath these plants more par¬ %0aticularly that the hypocisthis grows, of which we shall have %0aoccasion 3 to speak when treating of the herbs. %0a%0aCHAP. 49. -THE CISSOS ERYTHRANOS : TWO REMEDIES.

This kind, %0aFee says, appears not to have been identified. %0a%0a%0aChap. 50.] %0a%0a%0aTHE HEED. %0a%0a%0a35 %0a%0a%0asimilar to the ivy: taken in wine, it is good for sciatica and %0alumbago. The berries, it is said, are of so powerful a nature %0aas to produce bloody urine. “ Chamaecissos ” 5 also is a name %0agiven by them to a creeping ivy which never rises from the %0asurface of the ground : bruised in wine, in doses of one ace¬ %0atabulum, it is curative of affections of the spleen, the leaves %0aof it being applied topically with axle-grease to bums. %0a%0aThe smilax 6 also, otherwise known as the “ anthophoros,” 7 %0ahas a strong resemblance to ivy, but the leaves of it are smaller. %0aA chaplet, they say, made of an uneven number of the leaves, %0ais an effectual cure for head-ache. Some writers mention two %0akinds of smilax, one of which is all but perennial, and is found %0aclimbing the trees in umbrageous valleys, the berries hanging %0ain clusters. These berries, they say, are remarkably efficacious %0afor all kinds of poisons; so much so indeed, that infants to %0awhom the juice of them has been habitually administered, are %0arendered proof against all poisons for tbe rest of their life. %0aThe other kind, it is said, manifests a predilection for cultivated %0alocalities, and is often found growing there; but as for medicinal %0aproperties, it has none. The former kind, they say, is the %0asmilax, the wood of which we have mentioned 8 as emitting a %0asound, if held close to the ear. %0a%0aAnother plant, similar to this, they call by the name of %0a“ clematis :” 9 it is found adhering to trees, and has a jointed %0astem. The leaves of it cleanse leprous 10 sores, and the seed %0aacts as an aperient, taken in doses of one acetabulum, in one %0ahemina of water, or in hydromel. A decoction of it is pre¬ %0ascribed also for a similar purpose. %0a%0achap. 50.

I he %0aroot of the reed, pounded and applied to the part affected, %0aextracts the priekles of fern from the body, the root ol the %0afern having a similar effect upon splinters of the refed. Among %0athe numerous varieties which we have described, the scented %0areed 1 * which is grown in Judaea and Syria as an ingredient in %0aour unguents, boiled with hay-grass or parsley-seed, has a %0adiuretic effect: employed as a pessary, it acts as an emmena- %0agogue. Taken in drink, in doses of two oboli, it is curative %0aof convulsions, diseases of the liver and kidneys, and dropsy. %0aUsed as a fumigation, and with resin more particularly, it is %0agood for coughs, and a decoction of it with myrrh is useful for %0ascaly eruptions and running ulcers. A juice, too, is collected %0afrom it which has similar properties to those of elaterium . 11 %0a%0aIn every kind of reed the part that is the most efficacious is %0athat which lies nearest the root; the joints also are efficacious %0ain a high degree. The ashes of the Cyprian reed known as %0athe “ donax ,” 14 are curative of alopecy and putrid ulcers. %0aThe leaves of it are also used for the extraction 18 of pointed %0abodies from the flesh, and for erysipelas and all kinds of %0agatherings. The common reed, beaten up quite fresh, has %0aalso considerable extractive powers, and not in the root only, %0afor the stem, it is said, has a similar property. The root is %0aused also in vinegar as a topical application for sprains and %0afor pains in the spine; and beaten up fresh and taken in wine it %0aacts as an aphrodisiac. The down that grows on reeds, put %0ainto the ears, deadens the hearing . 17 %0a%0aCHAP. 51.- THE PAPYRUS, AND THE PAPER MADE FROM IT: %0a%0aTHREE REMEDIES. %0a%0aOf a kindred nature with the reed is the papyrus 18 of %0aEgypt; a plant that is remarkably useful, in a dried state, for %0a%0an Sympathies and antipathies existing in plants. Seec. 1 of this Book. %0a%0a13 Not a reed, Fee thinks, but some other monocotyledon that has not %0abeen identified. See B. xii. e. 48. %0a%0a14 See B. xx. c. 3. 15 See B. xvi. c. 66. %0a%0a16 Celsus also speaks of the root of the reed as being efficacious for this %0apurpose, B. v. c. 26. %0a%0a,7 Fee says that neither of these last assertions is true. %0a%0a13 See B. xiii. c. 21.

The plant, applied topically in water, removes %0acallosities of the skin. %0a%0aCHAP. 52 . -THE EBONY : FIVE Bl'HEDIES. %0a%0aThe ebony-tree 20 does not grow in Egypt even, as we have %0aalready stated, and it is not our intention to speak here of the %0amedicinal properties of the vegetable productions of foreign cli¬ %0amates. Still, however, the ebony must not be omitted, on %0aaccount of the marvels related of it. The saw-dust of this %0awood, it is said, is a sovereign remedy for diseases of the eyes, %0aand the pulp of the wood, rubbed upon a whetstone moistened %0awith raisin wine, dispels all films which impede the sight. %0aThe root too, they say, applied with water, is curative of %0awhite specks in the eyes, and, with the addition of root of %0adracunculus , 21 in equal proportions, and of honey, of cough. %0aMedical men reckon ebony also in the number of the caustics . 22 %0a%0aCHAP. 53 -THE RHODODENDRON : ONE REMEDY. %0a%0aThe rhododendron 23 has not sq much as found a Latin name %0aamong us, its other names being “ rhododaphne ” 24 and %0a“ nerium.” It is a marvellous fact, but the leaves 26 of this %0aplant are poisonous to quadrupeds ; while for man, if taken in %0awine with rue, they are an effectual preservative against the %0avenom of serpents. Sheep too, and goats, it is said, if they %0adrink water in which the leaves have been steeped, will die %0aimmediately. %0a%0a19 These statements as to the virtues of the ashes of papyrus, F6e says, %0aare absurd. %0a%0a20 See B. xii. c. 8. Desfontaines is inclined to identify the tree here %0aspoken of with the Diospyros ebenaster of Koenig. %0a%0a21 See c. 91 of this Book ; the Artemisia dracunculus of Linnaeus. %0a%0a22 “ Erodentia.” Fee remasks upon the singularity, that with this %0aproperty attributed to it, it should be recommended for diseases of the eyes. %0a%0a23 The “rose-tree.” Our rose-bay or oleander. 24 “ Rose-laiyel %0a%0a25 See B. xvi. c. 33.

Under this name %0aare comprehended a wild plant , 27 with leaves like those of %0amyrtle, and a short stem, which is good as an expellent of %0atapeworm ; and the shrub 28 which is known as the “ currier’s %0aplant,” of a reddish colour, a cubit in height, and about the %0athickness of one’s finger, the leaves of which are dried and %0aused, like pomegranate rind, for curing leather. %0a%0aMedical men also employ the leaves of these plants for the %0atreatment of contusions, and for the cure of coeliac affections, %0aand of ulcers of the rectum and phagedaenic sores ; for all which %0apurposes they are pounded with honey and applied with %0avinegar. A decoction of them is injected for suppurations of %0athe ears. With the branches, boiled, a stomatice 29 is also made, %0awhich is used for the same purposes as that prepared from %0amulberries ; 3U it is more efficacious, however, mixed with alum. %0aThis preparation is applied also to reduce the swelling in dropsy. %0a%0aCHAP. 55 . -RHUS ERTTHUOS : NINE REMEDIES. %0a%0aEhus 31 erythros is the name given to the seed of this shrub. %0aIt possesses properties of an astringent and cooling nature, and %0ais used as a seasoning 32 for provisions, in place of salt. It has %0aa laxative effect, and, used in conjunction with silphium, it %0agives a finer flavour to meat of all kinds. Mixed with honey, %0ait is curative of running ulcers, pimples on the tongue , 33 con¬ %0atusions, bruises, and excoriations.

It is used for %0adyeing wool, and skins for leather are prepared with it. Used %0amedicinally, it is a diuretic, and, employed with hydromel, it %0ais curative of jaundice . 35 Employed topically with vinegar, %0ait heals lichens ; and a potion is prepared from it for sciatica %0aand paralysis, the patient while using it taking a hath daily. %0aThe root of it and the seed are effectual as an emmenagogue ; %0athey act astringently upon the bowels, and disperse gatherings. %0aThe branches, together with the leaves, are applied to wounds %0ainflicted by serpents; the leaves too have the property of %0astaining the hair . 36 I find it stated by some writers that this %0ashrub is curative of jaundice, even if worn as an amulet only, %0aand looked at every now and then. %0a%0aCHAF. 57 .- THE ALYSSON '. TWO REMEDIES. %0a%0aThe plant known as the “ alysson ” 37 differs only from the %0apreceding one in the leaves and branches, which are more di¬ %0aminutive. It receives its name from the fact, that, taken in %0avinegar and worn as an amulet, it prevents persons bitten by %0adogs from becoming rabid. It is a marvellous fact too, that is %0aadded, to the effect that the person bitten has only to look %0aat this shrub, and the flow of corrupt matter from the wound %0awill be staunched immediately. %0a%0aCHAP. 58 . -THE RADICULA OR STRUTHION : THIRTEEN REMEDIES. %0a%0aTHE APOCYNUM : TWO OBSERVATIONS UPON IT. %0a%0aThe radicula, which we have already 38 mentioned as being %0acalled “struthion” by the Greeks, is used by dyers for pre¬ %0aparing wool. A decoction of it, taken internally, is curative %0aof jaundice and diseases of the chest. It is diuretic also, and %0alaxative, and acts as a detergent upon the uterus, for which %0areasons medical men have given it the name of the “ golden %0a%0aopinion that the “sandix” of B. xxxv. c. 12, is our madder, and identical %0awith the Rubia. It is not improbable, however, that in reality it was a %0amineral. See Beckmann’s Hist. Inv. Yol. II. p. 110, Bohn’s Ed. %0a%0a35 Fee says that it does not possess this property. %0a%0a36 Madder has no colouring matter which can produce any effect upon %0athe hair. %0a%0a37 Or “ anti-frantic ” plant. C. Bauhin identifies it with the Rubia %0asilvestris lsevis, or wild madder; Fee is at a loss for its identification, but %0ais inclined to think that it was a species of cultivated madder. %0a%0a33 In B. xix.c. 18. The Gypsophila struthium, or soap-plant, possibly. %0aIts identity is discussed at great length by Beckmann, Hist. Inv. Yol.

Applied with polenta and vinegar to the purls %0aaffected, it removes leprous sores. Used with panax and root %0aof the caper-plant, it breaks and expels calculi, and a decoction %0aof it in wine with barley-meal disperses inflamed tumours. It %0ais used as an ingredient in emollient plasters and eye-salves %0afor the sight, and is found to be one of the most useftil sternu- %0atories known ; it is good too for the liver and the spleen. Taken %0ain hydrornel, in doses of one denarius, it effects the cure of %0aasthma, as also of pleurisy and all pains iu the sides. %0a%0aThe apocynum 40 is a shrub with leaves like those of ivy, but %0asofter, and not so long in the stalk, and the seed of it is %0apointed and downy, with a division running down it, and a %0avery powerful smell. Given in their food with water, the seed %0ais poisonous 41 to dogs and all other quadrupeds. %0a%0aCHAP. 59 .- EOSEMAHY : EIGHTEEN KEMEDIES. %0a%0aThere are two kinds of rosemary ; one of which is barren, %0aand the other has a stem with a resinous seed, known as %0a“ cachrys.” The leaves have the odour of frankincense . 43 %0aThe root, applied fresh, effects the cure of wounds, prolapsus %0aof the rectum, condylomata, and piles. The juice of the %0aplant, as well as of the root, is curative of jaundice, and such %0adiseases as require detergents ; it is useful also for the sight. %0aThe seed is given in drink for inveterate diseases of the chest, %0aand, with wine and pepper, for affections of the uterus; it %0aacts also as an emmenagogue, and is used with meal of darnel %0aas a liniment for gout. It acts also as a detergent upon %0afreckles, and is used as an application in diseases which %0arequire calorifics or sudorifics, and for convulsions. The plant %0aitself, or else the root, taken in wine, increases the milk, and %0athe leaves and stem of the plant are applied with vinegar %0ato scrofulous sores; used with honey, they are very useful for %0acough. %0a%0a33 “ Aureum poculum.” %0a%0a40 Desfontaines says that it is the Periploca angustifolia; Fee gives the %0aApocynum folio subrotundo of C. Bauhin, round leafed do°-sbane. %0a%0a11 This is the fact; and hence one of its names “ cynanche,” or “ dog- %0astrangle.” %0a%0athis, Fee says, is the fact. The plant is rich in essential oil, and is %0aconsequently a powerful excitant.

It neu¬ %0atralizes poisons and the venom of animals, that of serpents %0aexcepted. It acts also as a sudorific, dispels griping pains in %0athe bowels, and increases the milk in nursing women. %0a%0aCHAP. 61 . -THE HERB SAVIN : SEVEN REMEDIES. %0a%0aOf the herb savin, known as “ brathy” by the Greeks , 46 there %0aare two varieties, one of them 48 with a leaf like that of the %0atamarix, the other 47 with that of the cypress ; for which reason %0asome persons have called this last the Cretan cypress. It is %0aused by many for fumigations, as a substitute for frankin¬ %0acense ; 48 employed in medicine, it is said to have the same effect %0aas cinnamon, if taken in doses twice as large. It reduces %0agatherings, disperses corrosive sores, acts as a detergent upon %0aulcers, and, used as a pessary and as a fumigation, brings away %0athe dead foetus . 49 It is employed as a topical application for %0aerysipelas and carbuncles, and, taken with honey in wine, is %0acurative of jaundice. %0a%0aThe smoke of this plant, they say, cures the pip in all kinds %0aof poultry . 60 %0a%0aCHAP. 62 . -SELAGO : TWO REMEDIES. %0a%0aSimilar to savin is the herb known as “ selago .” 61 Care is %0a%0a43 In B. xvi. c. 11. %0a%0a44 A gall or fungoid production, or, in some instances, a catkin. Fee %0asays that Pliny has committed an error here in attributing a cachrys to %0arosemary, the Libauotis stephanomaticos, which, in reality, belongs to %0athe Libanotis canchryphorus or Libanotis prima. %0a%0a45 So called from the Greek fipaSv, “ slow,” according to some au¬ %0athorities; by reason of the slowness of its growth. %0a%0a46 Identified by Fee with the Sabina vulgatior of Lobelius, or Juniperus %0aSabina, variety /3, of Lamarck. %0a%0a47 The Sabina baceifera of J. Bauhin, the male savin, the type of the %0aplant. %0a%0a48 See Ovid’s Fasti, B. i. 1. 341, as to this custom, and Virgil’s “ Culex,” %0a1. 403. %0a%0a49 It is still a common notion, though Fee says an ill-founded one, that %0ait produces abortion. Indeed we find Galen stating to the same effect. %0a%0a30 Fee ridicules this notion with considerable zest. %0a%0a41 Tho Lycopodium sclago of Linnaeus, upright club-moss, or fir- moss, %0a%0a%0a42 %0a%0a%0aflint's natural history. %0a%0a%0a[Book XXIV. %0a%0a%0ataken to gather it without the use of iron, the right hand %0abeing passed for the purpose through the left sleeve of the %0atunic, as though the gatherer were in the act of committing a %0atheft . 52 The clothing too must be white, the feet bare and %0awashed clean, and a sacrifice of bread and wine must be made %0abefore gathering it: it is carried also in a new napkin. The %0aDruids of Gaul have pretended that this plant should be %0acarried about the person as a preservative against accidents of %0aall kinds, and that the smoke of it is extremely good for all %0amaladies of the eyes. %0a%0aCHAP. 63 .- SAMOLUS : TWO REMEDIES. %0a%0aThe Druids, also, have given the name of “ samolus ’ to a %0acertain plant which grows in humid localities. This too, they %0asay, must be gathered fasting with the left hand, as a pre¬ %0aservative against the maladies to which swine and cattle are %0asoibject. The person, too, who gathers it must be careful not %0ato look behind him, nor must it be laid anywhere but in the %0atroughs from which the cattle drink. %0a%0aCHAP. 64.—GUM : ELEVEN REMEDIES. %0a%0aWe have already 51 spoken of the different kinds of gum; %0athe better sort of each kind will be found the most effective. %0aGum is bad for the teeth; it tends to make the blood coagu¬ %0alate, and is consequently good for discharges 55 of blood from %0athe mouth. It is useful for burns , 56 but is bad for diseases of %0athe trachea. It exercises a diuretic effect, and tends to %0aneutralize all acridities, being astringent in other respects. %0aThe gum of the bitter-almond tree, which, has the most 57 %0a%0aaccording to Sprengel. Fee, however, dissents from that opinion, for the %0aLycopodium, he says, is but some three inches in height, while savin, with %0awhich the Selago is here compared, is more than eight or ten feet high. De %0aTheis {Gloss. Botan.) thinks that it must have been a succulent plant; but %0aupon what grounds he bases that conjecture, Fee declares himself at a loss %0ato conjecture. %0a%0a52 Evidently a superstition derived from the Druids. %0a%0a53 Sprengel thinks that it is the Samolus Valerandi of Linnaeus, the round- %0aleaved water-pimpernel, and Anguillara identifies it with the Anemone pul- %0asatilla, or pasque-flower. Fee inclines to the opinion that it is the Veronica %0abeceabunga of Linnaeus, the brook-lime. %0a%0a54 In B. xiii. c. 20. %0a%0a55 Gum is still used, Fee says, for this purpose. %0a%0a56 It is of no use whatever for burns, or as a diuretic. %0a%0a57 Fee says that it is not different in any way from the gum of other trees. %0a%0a%0a%0a%0aGEM ACACIA. %0a%0a%0a43 %0a%0a%0aChap. 67.] %0a%0aastringent properties of them all, is calorific also in its effects. %0aStill, however, the gum of the plum, cherry, and vine is %0agreatly preferred : all which kinds, applied topically, are pro¬ %0aductive of astringent and desiccative effects, and, used with %0avinegar, heal lichens upon infants. Taken in must, in doses %0aof four oboli, they are good for inveterate coughs. %0a%0aIt is generally thought that gum, taken in raisin wine, %0aimproves the complexion , 58 sharpens the appetite, and is %0agood for calculi 69 in the bladder. It is particularly useful too %0afor wounds and affections of the eyes. %0a%0aCHAP. 65 . ( 12 .)- THE EGYPTIAN OR ARABIAN THORN J POUR %0a%0aREMEDIES. %0a%0aWhen speaking 60 of the perfumes, we have descanted upon %0athe merits of the Egyptian or Arabian thorn. This, too, is of %0aan astringent nature, and acts as a desiccative upon fluxes of %0aall kinds, discharges of blood from the mouth, and excessive %0amenstruation; for all which purposes the root is still more %0aefficacious. %0a%0aCHAP. 66.-THE WHITE THORN : TWO REMEDIES. THE ACANTHION ; %0a%0aONE REMEDY. %0a%0aThe seed of the white thorn is useful as a remedy for the %0astings of scorpions, and a chaplet made of it, is good for head¬ %0aache. Similar to this plant is that known to the Greeks as %0athe “ acanthion ;” 61 though it is much smaller in the leaf, which %0ais pointed at the extremity, and covered with a down like a %0acobweb in appearance. This downy substance is gathered in %0athe East, and certain textures are made of it similar to those %0aof silk. An infusion of the leaves or root of this plant is taken %0afor the cure of opisthotony. %0a%0aCHAP. 67 . -GEM ACACIA : EIGHTEEN REMEDIES. %0a%0aGum acacia is produced also from the white and black 62 %0a%0a5 " Fee remarks, that gum is injurious as a cosmetic. %0a%0a59 Gum is of no use whatever in such a case. %0a%0a60 In B. xiii. c. 19.

There ig %0aalso a similar gum found in Galatia, but of very inferior %0aquality, the produce of a more thorny tree 0 '* than those last %0amentioned. The seed of all these trees resembles* 4 the lentil %0ain appearance, only that it is smaller, as well as the pod which %0acontains it: it is gathered in autumn, before which period it %0awould be too powerful in its effects. The juice is left to %0athicken in the pods, which are steeped in rain-water for the %0apurpose, and then pounded in a mortar; after which, the %0ajuice is extracted by means of presses. It is then dried in the %0amortars in the sun, and when dry is divided into tablets. A %0asimilar juice is extracted from the leaves, but it is by no %0ameans 64 so useful as the other. The seed is used also, as a %0asubstitute for nut-galls in curing leather. 66 %0a%0aThe juice extracted from the leaves, as also the extremely %0ablack juice of the Galatian 67 acacia, is held in no esteem. The %0a6ame too with that of a deep red colour. The gum which is %0aof a purple, or of an ashy, grey colour, and which dissolves %0awith the greatest rapidity, possesses the most astringent and %0acooling qualities of them all, and is more particularly useful as %0aan ingredient in compositions for the eyes. When required %0afor these purposes, the tablets are steeped in water by some, %0awhile some again scorch them, and others reduce them to %0aashes. They are useful for dyeing the hair, and for the cure of %0aerysipelas, serpiginous sores, ulcerations of the humid parts of %0athe body, gatherings, contusions of the joints, chilblains, and %0ahangnails. They are good also for cases of excessive menstru¬ %0aation, procidence of the uterus and rectum, affections of the %0aeyes, and ulcerations of the generative organs 68 and mouth, %0anaeus, the white hawthorn, or May. In the present passage, however, it %0ais doubtful whether the colours apply to the varieties of gum, or to the trees %0awhich produce them.

The best kind is that which is the %0aleast 73 ferulaceous in the stem, and which is of a red colour, or %0ainclining to purple, when the bark is removed. It is found %0agrowing in many places, but is not everywhere odoriferous. %0aWe have already 74 stated how remarkably sweet the odour of %0ait is, when the rainbow has been extended over it. %0a%0aThis plant cures fetid ulcers of the mouth, polypus 78 of the %0anose, ulcerations or carbuncles of the generative organs, and %0achaps ; taken in drink it acts as a carminative, and is curative %0aof strangury. The bark is good for patients troubled with %0adischarges of blood, and a decoction of it acts astringently on %0athe bowels. It is generally thought that the wild plant is %0aproductive of the same effects. %0a%0a69 Fbe suggests that this may be the Dipsacus fullonum of Linnaeus, %0athe fuller’s thistle. %0a%0a%3c u See B. xix. c. 18, and c. 58 of this Book. %0a%0a11 In B. xii. c. 52. But in that passage he makes the Aspalathos to be %0aidentical with the Erysisceptrum, which he here distinguishes from it. Fee %0athinks that there can be no identity between the common thorn here men¬ %0ationed, and the Aspalathos. This latter, as mentioned in B. xii., according %0ato Fee, is the Convolvulus scoparius of Linnaeus, the broom bindweed, but %0aLittre says that M. Fraas has identified it with the Genista acanthoclada. %0a%0a73 See the preceding Note. Fee identifies this Aspalathos with the %0aSpartiura villosum of Linnaeus, making that of B xii. c. 52, to be the Lignum %0alihodianum of commerce, probably the Convolvulus scoparius of Linnaeus. %0a%0a73 The corresponding passage in Dioscorides has flapvs, “heavy,” e. %0athe most- solid in the stem. %0a%0a74 In B. xii. c. 52. %0a%0a%0ar * “ Ozsenas.” %0a%0a%0a46 %0a%0a%0apliny’s natural history. %0a%0a%0a[Book XXIV. %0a%0a%0aCHAP. 70 . -THE THORN CALLED APPENDIX : TWO REMEDIES. %0a%0aTHE TYRACANTHA : ONE REMEDY. %0a%0aThere is a thorn also known as the appendix ; that name %0abeing given to the red berries which hang from its branches. %0aThese berries eaten by themselves, raw, or else dried and %0aboiled in wine, arrest looseness of the bowels and dispel %0agriping pains in the stomach.

It receives its name probably from the redness of its %0aberries, which are the colour of fire. %0a%0a78 Fee considers this to be the Paliurus aculeatus of Decandolle, and not %0aidentical with the Paliurus mentioned in B. xiii. c. 33. %0a%0a79 Fee thinks that the copyists have made a mistake in this passage, and %0athat the reading should be “ aquifolia,” the same plant that is mentioned %0aafterwards under that name. He identifies them with the Ilex aquifolium, %0aor holly. See B. xvi. cc. 8,12, where Pliny evidently confounds the holm %0aoak with the holly. %0a%0a80 Dioscorides says, B. i. c. 119, “the branches of the rkamnm, it is %0asaid, placed at the doors and windows, will avert the spells of sorcerers.” %0a%0a%0aTHE BEAMBLE. %0a%0a%0a47 %0a%0a%0aChap. 73.] %0a%0ahouse, is a preservative against sorceries and spells.

Other authorities identify it with the Rubus caninus, or with %0athe Rosa sempervirens.

It is %0aof a more delicate nature than the others, and smaller; the %0acanes too are thinner, and not 7 so prickly: it mostly grows %0abeneath the shade of trees. The blossom of it, mixed with %0ahoney, is applied topically for defluxions of the eyes, and is %0aadministered in water for erysipelas and affections of the %0astomach. 8 In other respects, it has properties similar to those %0aof the plants 9 already mentioned. %0a%0aCHAT. 76 .- THE RHAMNOS; TWO VARIETIES OF IT: FIVE REMEDIES. %0a%0aAmong the several kinds 10 of bramble is reckoned the plant %0acalled “ rhamnos” by the Greeks. One variety of it is whiter" %0athan the other, and has a more shrublike appearance, throwing %0aout branches armed with straight thorns, and not hooked, like %0athose of the other kinds; the leaves too are larger. The other %0akind, 12 which is found growing wild, is of a more swarthy hue, %0ain some measure inclining to red ; it bears too a sort 13 of pod. %0aWith the root of it boiled in water a medicament is made, %0aknown as “lycium:” 14 the seed of it is useful for bringing %0aaway the after-birth. The white kind, however, is of a more %0aastringent and cooling nature, and better adapted for the treat¬ %0ament of gatherings and wounds. The leaves of both kinds, %0aeither raw or boiled, are employed topically with oil. %0a%0a6 The raspberry; see B. xvi. c. 71. %0a%0a7 There is one variety which is very diminutive, and entirely destitute %0a%0aof thorns, the Rubus Idseus lsevis of C.

Fee, however, takes %0ait to be the Rhamnus saxatilis of Linnaeus, the rock buckthorn. %0a%0a12 Identified by some authorities with the Paliurus aculeatus of Decan- %0adolles, mentioned in c. 71.

The branches and roots, which are intensely %0abitter, 17 are first pounded and then boiled for three days in %0aa copper vessel, after which the woody parts are removed, %0aand the decoction is boiled again, till it has attained the %0aconsistency of honey. It is adulterated with various bitter %0aextracts, 18 as also with amurca of olive oil and ox-gall. The %0afroth or flower 19 of this decoction is used as an ingredient in %0acompositions for the eyes : and the other part of it is employed %0aas a cosmetic for the face, and for the cure of itch-scabs, %0acorroding sores in the corners of the eyes, inveterate fluxes, %0aand suppurations of the ears. It is useful too for diseases of %0athe tonsillary glands and gums, for coughs, and for discharges %0aof blood from the mouth, being generally taken in pieces the %0asize of a bean. For the cure of discharges from wounds, it %0ais applied to the part affected; and it is similarly used for %0achaps, ulcerations of the genitals, excoriations, ulcers, whether %0aputrid, serpiginous, or of recent date, hard excrescences 20 of %0athe nostrils, and suppurations. It is taken also by females, %0ain milk, for the purpose of arresting the catamenia when in %0aexcess. %0a%0aThe Indian lycium is distinguished from the other kinds %0aby its colour, the lumps being black outside, and, when broken, %0ared within, though they turn black very quickly. 21 It is %0abitter and remarkably astringent, and is employed for all the %0apurposes above mentioned, diseases of the generative organs in %0aparticular. %0a%0a15 See B. xii. c. 15. Fee identifies this with the modern Catechu, a de¬ %0acoction from the Acacia catechu, a leguminous plant of the East Indies. %0a%0a16 The Rhamnus lycioides of Linnaeus, our buckthorn. The Indian %0aplant from which catechu is extracted is of a similar nature.

The juice of the leaves, %0amixed with oil, disperses films on the eyes ; it is taken also, in %0avinegar, for diseases of the spleen; employed as a friction, it is %0aof a warming nature. %0a%0aCHAP. 81 . -THE CHAMiEBAPHNE : FIVE BEMEDIES. %0a%0aThe chamccdaphne 31 consists of a single diminutive stem, %0aabout a cubit in height, the limbs of it being smaller than %0athose of the laurel. These leaves * * * The seed, which is %0aof a red colour, and attached to the leaves, is applied fresh for %0ahead-ache, is of a cooling nature for burning heats, and is %0ataken for griping pains in the bowels, with wine.

It is of a purgative 33 nature, and carries off phlegm %0aand bile; for which purposes, the leaves are boiled with twice %0athe quantity of wormwood, and the decoction taken with %0ahoney. The leaves, applied to ulcers, have a detergent effect. %0aIt is said, that if a person gathers it before sunrise, taking care %0ato mention that he is gathering it for the cure of white specks 34 %0ain the eyes, and then wears it as an amulet, it will effect a cure: %0aas also that, gathered in any way, it is beneficial for the eyes %0aof beasts of burden and cattle. %0a%0aCHAP. 83 . -THE CHAMiESYCE : EIGHT REMEDIES. %0a%0aThe chamaesyce 35 has leaves similar to those of the lentil, and %0alying close to the ground; it is found growing in dry, rocky, %0alocalities. A decoction of it in wine is remarkably useful as a %0aliniment for improving 36 the sight, and for dispersing cataract, %0acicatrizations, films, and cloudiness of the eyes. Applied in a %0apledget of linen, as a pessary, it allays pains in the uterus; %0aand used topically 37 it removes warts and excrescences of all %0akinds. It is very useful also for hardness of breathing. %0a%0aCHAP. 84 . -THE CHAMiECISSOS I ONE REMEDY. %0a%0aThe chamaecissos 38 has ears like 39 those of wheat, with %0anumerous leaves, and small branches, about five in number. %0aWhen in blossom it might almost be taken for the white violet: %0athe root of it is diminutive. For sciatica, the leaves of it are %0ataken, seven days consecutively, in doses of three oboli, in two %0acyathi of wine : this is a very bitter potion, however. %0a%0aCHAP. 85 . -THE CHAMiELEUCE, FARFARUM, OR FARFUGIUM : ONE %0a%0aREMEDY. %0a%0aThe chamaeleuce 40 is known among us as the “ farfarum” or %0a“ farfugium it grows on the banks of rivers, and has a leaf %0a%0a33 This, Fee says, is consistent with modern experience ; indeed it is %0adrastic to a dangerous extent. 34 “ Albugines.” %0a%0a35 Or “ ground fig.” The Euphorbia chamaesyce, or annual spurge. %0a%0a36 The juices are irritating and acrid, and would in reality be highly %0adangerous to the eyes. %0a%0a37 Owing to its caustic powers, it really is good for the removal of warts. %0a%0a38 Or “ground-ivy.” SeeB. xvi. c. 62', and c. 49 of this Book. %0a%0a39 Fee 6ays that this comparison is not strictly correct. %0a%0a40 The “ground-poplar.” See B. xxvi. c. 19.

The chamaecyparissos 43 is a herb which, taken in %0awine, counteracts the venom of serpents of all kinds, and of %0ascorpions. %0a%0aThe ampeloprason 44 is found growing in vineyards; it has %0aleaves like those of the leek, and produces offensive eructa¬ %0ations. It is highly efficacious for the stings of serpents, and %0aacts as an emmenagogue and diuretic. Taken in drink or %0aapplied externally, it arrests discharges of blood from the gene¬ %0arative organs. It is prescribed also for females after delivery, %0aand is used for bites inflicted by dogs. %0a%0aThe plant known as “ stachys” bears a strong resemblance %0aalso to a leek, 45 but the leaves of it are longer and more nume¬ %0arous. It has an agreeable smell, and in colour inclines to %0ayellow.

It is no longer used in medicine, and all that Pliny %0astates as to its medicinal properties is quite unfounded, Fee says. %0a%0a45 Fee thinks that Pliny has committed an error here, and that the %0aword “ marrubii ” should be substituted, our “ horehound.” He identifies %0ait with the Stachys Germanica of Linnaeus, or base^ horehound; which %0ais more commonly found in the South of Europe than in Germany. %0a%0a46 Or “ bed-foot.” The Clinopodium vulgare of Linnaeus, our wild %0a%0a%0a56 %0a%0a%0aflint’s natural history. %0a%0a%0a[Book XXIV. %0a%0a%0ables wild thyme in appearance. The stem of it is tough and %0aligneous, and it is a palm in height. It grows in stony soils, %0aand the leaves are trained regularly around the stem, 17 which %0aresembles a bed-post in appearance. This plant is taken in %0adrink, for convulsions, ruptures, strangury, and wounds inflicted %0aby serpents: a decoction is also made of it, and the juice is %0asimilarly employed. %0a%0aCHAP. 88.-THE CLEMATIS CENTUNCULUS ; THREE REMEDIES. %0a%0aWe shall now have to annex some plants, of a marvellous %0anature no doubt, but not so well known, reserving those of a %0ahigher reputation for the succeeding Hooks. %0a%0aOur people give the name of “ centunculus,” 48 to a creep¬ %0aing plant that grows in the fields, the leaves of which bear a %0astrong resemblance to the hoods attached to our cloaks. By %0athe Greeks it is known as the “ clematis.” Taken in astrin¬ %0agent wine it is wonderfully effectual for arresting 41 * diarrhoea: %0abeaten up, in doses of one denarius, in five cyathi of oxymel %0aor of warm water, it arrests haemorrhage, and facilitates the %0aafter-birth. %0a%0aCHAP. 89 . -THE CLEMATIS ECHITES, OR LAflINE. %0a%0aThe Greeks have other varieties also of the clematis, one of %0awhich is known as “ echites” 50 or “lagine,” and by some as %0athe “ little scammony.” Its stems are about two feet in height, %0aand covered with leaves: in general appearance it is not %0aunlike scammony, were it not that the leaves are darker and %0amore diminutive; it is found growing in vineyards and cultivated %0asoils. It is eaten as a vegetable, with oil and salt, and acts as %0aa laxative upon the bowels. It is taken 51 also for dysentery, %0a%0abasil. It has some useful properties attributed to it; but what Pliny here %0astates respecting it is erroneous. %0a%0a47 This seems to be the meaning of “orbiculato foliorum ambitu." %0a%0a*i Turner and C. Bauhin identify it with the Gnaphalium Germanicura %0aof Lamarck, and Sprengel with the Polygonum convolvulus of Linnaeus. %0aIf so, I ee says, the synonym here given by Pliny is erroneous; for the %0aGreek clematis, there can be little doubt, is the Clematis cirrhosa of Lin¬ %0anaeus. See the account given of the Gnaphalion in B. xxvii. c. 61. %0a%0a49 All that Pliny states as to its medicinal properties, Fee says, is %0a%0a•erroneous. ; %0a%0a50 ^ obabl y the Asclepias nigra of Linnaeus, black swallow-wort %0a%0a51 The Asclepias nigra has no such medicinal effects as those mentioned %0aby Pliny. %0a%0a%0aChap. 91.] %0a%0a%0aTUB UliACONTIUM. %0a%0a%0a57 %0a%0a%0awith linseed, in astringent wine.

Applied %0ato scrofulous sores, they cause them to suppurate, and if some %0aaxle-grease is then applied, a perfect cure will be effected. %0aThey are applied also to piles, with green oil, and are good %0afor phthisis, in combination with honey. Taken with the %0afood, they increase the milk in nursing women, and, rubbed %0aupon the heads of infants, they promote the rapid growth of %0athe hair. Eaten with vinegar, they act as an aphrodisiac. %0a%0aCHAP. 90 . -THE EGYPTIAN CLEMATIS, DAPHNOIDES, OB POLY- %0a%0aGONOIDES : TWO EEMEDIES. %0a%0aThere is another kind also, known as the “ Egyptian” 52 %0aclematis, otherwise as “daphnoides” 83 or “polygonoides:” it has %0aa leaf like that of the laurel, and is long and slender. Taken %0ain vinegar, it is very useful for the stings of serpents, that of %0athe asp in particular. %0a%0aCHAP. 91 . ( 16 .) -DIFFEKENT OPINIONS ON THE DEACONTICM. %0a%0aIt is Egypt more particularly that produces the clematis %0aknown as the “aron,” of which we have already 81 made some %0amention when speaking of the bulbs. Respecting this plant %0aand the dracontium, there have been considerable differences %0aof opinion. Some writers, indeed, have maintained that they %0aare identical, and Glaucias has made the only distinction %0abetween them in reference to the place of their growth, %0aassuming that the dracontium is nothing else than the aron in %0aa wild state. Some persons, again, have called the root “ aron,” %0aand the stem of the plant “ dracontium but if the dracon¬ %0atium is the same as the one known to us as the “ dracuncu- %0alus,” 85 it is a different plant altogether; for while the aron has %0aa broad, black, rounded root, and considerably larger,—large %0aenough, indeed, to fill the hand,—the dracunculus has a %0a%0a52 The Vinca major and Vinca minor of Linnaeus, the greater and smaller %0aperiwinkle. Fee is at a loss to know why it should be called “ Egyptian,” %0aas it is a plant of Europe. %0a%0a53 “ Laurel-shaped ” and “ many-cornered.” %0a%0a54 In B. xix. c. 30. %0a%0a45 Fee says that the Dracontion of the Greeks and the Dracunculus of %0athe Latins are identical, being represented in modern Botany by the Arum %0adracunculus of Linnaeus, the common dragon. %0a%0a%0a58 PLINY* 8 NATH UAL HI8TOBY.

As an article of food, %0ahowever, they give the preference to the female plant, the %0amale plant being of a harder nature, and more difficult to cook. %0aIt carries off, 69 they say, all vicious humours from the chest, %0aand powdered and taken in the form either of a potion or of %0aan electuary, it acts as a diuretic and emmenagogue. Powdered %0aand taken in oxymel, it is good for the stomach; and we find %0ait stated that it is administered in ewe’s milk for ulcerations %0aof the intestines, and is sometimes cooked on hot ashes and %0agiven in oil for a cough. Some persons, again, are in the habit %0aof boiling it in milk and administering the decoction ; and it %0ahas been used also in a boiled state as a topical application for %0adefluxions of the eyes, contusions, and affections of the tonsil¬ %0alary glands. * * * * 60 prescribes it with oil, as an %0a%0ainjection for piles, and recommends it as a liniment, with %0ahoney, for freckles. %0a%0aCleophantus has greatly extolled this plant as an antidote for %0apoisons, and for the treatment of pleurisy and peripneumony, %0aprepared the same way as for coughs. The seed too, pounded %0awith olive oil or oil of roses, is used as an injection for pains %0a%0a56 From “ draco,” a “ dragon ” or “ serpent.” Fee says, that it is not %0ato its roots, but to its spotted stem, resembling the skin of an adder, that %0ait owes its name. %0a%0a57 i; Vi ms .” Fee says that the Arum dracunculus has a strong, fetid %0aodour, and all parts of it are acrid and caustic, while the Arum colocasia %0ahas an agreeable flavour when boiled. %0a%0a69 This, Fee says, is fabulous. %0a%0a59 Though no longer used in medicine, the account here given of the %0aproperties of the Arum colocasia is in general correct, a few marvellous %0adetails excepted. %0a%0a60 Sillig thinks that there is a lacuna here, and that the name “ Cleo¬ %0aphantus ” should be supplied. %0a%0a%0aCbap. 92.] %0a%0a%0aTHE AEON". %0a%0a%0a59 %0a%0ain the ears. Dieuches prescribes it, mixed in bread 61 with meal, %0afor the cure of coughs, asthma, hardness of breathing, and %0apurulent expectorations. Diodotus recommends it, in combi¬ %0anation with honey, as an electuary for phthisis and diseases of %0athe lungs, and as a topical application even for fractured bones. %0aApplied to the sexual parts, it facilitates delivery in all kinds %0aof animals; and the juice extracted from the root, in combina¬ %0ation with Attic honey, disperses films upon the eyes, and %0adiseases of the stomach. A decoction of it with honey is %0acurative of cough ; and the juice is a marvellous remedy for %0aulcers of every description, whether phagedsenic, carcinomatous, %0aor serpiginous, and for polypus of the nostrils. The leaves, %0aboiled in wine and oil, are good for burns, and, taken with %0asalt and vinegar, are strongly purgative; boiled with honey, %0athey are useful also for sprains, and used either fresh or %0adried, with salt, for gout in the joints. %0a%0aHippocrates has prescribed the leaves, either fresh or %0adried, with honey, as a topical application for abscesses. Two %0adrachmae of the seed or root, in two cyathi of wine, are a %0asufficient dose to act as an emmenagogue, and a similar quan¬ %0atity will have the effect of bringing away the after-birth, in %0acases where it is retarded. 62 Hippocrates used to apply the root %0aalso, for the purpose. They say too, that in times of pestilence %0athe employment of aron as an article of food is very beneficial. %0aIt dispels the fumes of wine ; and the smoke of it burnt drives %0aaway serpents, 63 the asp in particular, or else stupefies them to %0a6uch a degree as to reduce them to a state of torpor. These %0areptiles also will fly at the approach of persons whose bodies %0ahave been rubbed with a preparation of aron with oil of %0alaurel: hence it is generally thought a good plan to administer %0ait in red wine to persons who have been stung by serpents. %0aCheese, it is said, keeps remarkably well, wrapped in leaves %0aof thiB plant. %0a%0a61 F6e thinks that, thus employed, it would be more injurious than %0abeneficial. Though Pliny is treating here of the Arum colocasia or %0aEgyptian Arum, he has mingled some few details with it, relative to the %0aArum dracunculus, a plant endowed with much more energetic properties. %0aSee Note 57 above. %0a%0a62 See B. viii. c. 54, as to the use alleged to be made by animals of this %0aplant. %0a%0a63 Fee says that this is very doubtful. %0a%0a%0a60 %0a%0a%0apltnt’s natural htstort. %0a%0a%0a[Book XXIV. %0a%0a%0aCHAP. 93 . -THE DRACTJNCUL0S ; TWO REMEDIES. %0a%0aThe plant whioh I have spoken of 65 as the dracunculus, is %0ataken out of the ground just when the barley is ripening, and %0aat the moon’s increase. It is quite sufficient to ha^e this %0aplant about one, to be safe from all serpents; and it is said, %0athat an infusion of the larger kind taken in drink, is very useful %0afor persons who have been stung by those reptiles : it is stated %0aalso that it arrests the catamenia when in excess, due care being %0ataken not to let iron touch it. The juice of it too is very use¬ %0aful for pains in the ears. %0a%0aAs to the plant known to the Greeks by the name of “ dra- %0acontion,” I have 66 had it pointed out to me under three dif¬ %0aferent forms ; the first 67 having the leaves of the beet, with a %0acertain proportion of stem, and a purple flower, and bearing %0aa strong resemblance to the aron. Other persons, again, have %0adescribed it as a plant 69 with a long root, embossed to all ap¬ %0apearance and full of knots, and consisting of three stems in all; %0athe same parties have recommended a decoction of the leaves %0ain vinegar, as curative of stings inflicted by serpents. The %0athird 70 plant that has been pointed out to me has a leaf larger %0athan that of the cornel, and a root resembling that of the reed. %0aThis root, I have been assured, has as many knots on it as the %0aplant is years old, the leaves, too, being as many in number. %0aThe plant is recommended also for the stings of serpents, %0aadministered either in wine or in water. %0a%0aCHAP. 94.-THE ARISAKOS : THREE REMEDIES. %0a%0aThere is a plant also called the “ arisaros,” 71 which grows %0ain Egypt, and is similar to the aron in appearance, only that %0ait is more diminutive, and has smaller leaves; the root too is %0asmaller, though fully as large as a good-sized olive.

It grows in marshy lo¬ %0acalities, and is remarkably useful for the treatment of wounds. %0aIt is taken in vinegar for strangury, affections of the bladder, %0aasthma, and falls with violence ; it is extremely efficacious also %0afor tooth-ache. %0a%0aIn Etruria, the same name is given to a small meadow- %0aplant , 73 provided with leaves at the sides, like hairs, and par¬ %0aticularly useful for wounds.

(17.)- CORACESTA AND CALLICIA. %0a%0aWhile I am treating of plants of a marvellous nature, I am %0ainduced to make some mention of certain magical plants—for %0awhat, in fact, can there be more marvellous than they ? The first %0awho descanted upon this subject in our part of the world were %0aPythagoras and Democritus, who have adopted the accounts %0agiven by the Magi. Coracesta 79 and callicia, according to %0aPythagoras, are plants which congeal 30 water. I find no %0amention made of them, however, by any other author, and he %0ahimself gives no further particulars relative to them. %0a%0adouin says that it is musk chervil, the Chajrophyllum aromaticum of Lin¬ %0anaeus, in which he has followed Dodonaeus. Fuchsius suggests the Chsero- %0aphyllum silvestre of Linnaeus: Fee expresses himself at a loss to decide. %0a%0a77 Probably the Iledysarum onobrychis of Linnaeus, our sainfoin. %0a%0a78 They are very much larger than those of the lentil, in fact. This %0adiversity has caused Fee to express some doubts whether it really is iden¬ %0atical with sainfoin. The Polygala officinalis has also been suggested. %0a%0a79 Dalechauips considers these appellations to mean the “ vir%3cnns’ plant,” %0aand the “plant of beauty.” %0a%0a80 The Cissampelos Pareira, as already stated, abounds in mucilage to %0asuch a degree, as to impart a consistency to water, without impairing its %0atransparency.

He adds too, that if this decoction is poured %0aupon the grass, and a person happens to tread upon it, or if %0athe body should chance to be sprinkled with it, the result is %0afatal beyond all remedy; so monstrously malignant are the %0avenomous proporties of this plant, except as neutralizing %0aother kinds of poison. %0a%0aCHAP 101. -THE APROXIS: SIX REMEDIES. %0a%0aPythagoras makes mention, too, of a plant called aproxis, %0athe root of which takes fire 82 at a distance, like naphtha, of %0awhich we have made some mention, when speaking 83 of the mar¬ %0avellous productions of the earth. He says too, that if the %0ahuman body happens to be attacked by any disease while the %0acabbage 81 is in blossom, the person, although he may have %0abeen perfectly cured, will be sensible of a recurrence of the %0asymptoms, every time that plant comes into blossom; a %0apeculiarity which he attributes to it in common with wheat, %0ahemlock, and the violet. %0a%0aI am not ignorant, however, that the work of his from %0awhich I have just quoted is ascribed to the physician Cleem- %0aporu3 by some, though antiquity and the unbroken current of %0atradition concur in claiming it for Pythagoras. It is quite %0aenough, however, to say in favour of a book, that the author %0ahas deemed the results of his labours worthy to be published %0aunder the name of so great a man. And yet who can believe %0athat Cleemporus would do this, seeing that he has not %0ahesitated to publish other works under his own name ? %0a%0a81 The reading of this word is doubtful. Hardouin thinks that it is the %0asame as the’Minyanthes mentioned in B. xxi. c. 88. %0a%0a82 Fee says that the only cases known of a phsenomenon resembling %0athis, are those of the Dictamnus albus, white dittany, which attracts flame %0amomentarily when in flower, and of the Tropceolum majus, or great Indian %0acress. He thinks, however, that there are some trees so rich in essential %0aoil, that they might possibly ignite as readily as naphtha. %0a%0a83 In B. ii. c. 109. %0a%0a61 Another reading here is “ aproxis,” which seems more probable. %0a%0a%0a64 %0a%0a%0aPLINY’S NATURAL HISTORY. %0a%0a%0a[Book XXIV. %0a%0a%0aCHAP. 102.-THE AGLAOPHOTIS OR MARMARITIS.

How very much more %0amarvellous too are the accounts given in this book by the %0aphilosopher who, next to Pythagoras, has acquired the most in¬ %0atimate knowledge of the learning of the Magi! According %0ato him, the plant aglaophotis, 86 which owes its name to the %0aadmiration in which its beauteous tints are held by man, is %0afound growing among the marble quarries of Arabia, on the %0aside of Persia, a circumstance which has given it the additional %0aname of “ marmaritis.” By means of this plant, he says, the %0aMagi can summon the deities into their presence when they %0aplease. %0a%0aThe achaemenis, 87 he says, a plant the colour of amber, %0aand destitute of leaves, grows in the country of theTradastili, an %0aIndian race. The root of it, divided into lozenges and taken %0ain wine in the day time, torments the guilty to such a degree %0aduring the night by the various forms of avenging deities pre¬ %0asented to the imagination, as to extort from them a confession %0aof their crimes. He gives it the name also of “ hippophobas,” %0ait being an especial object of terror to mares. %0a%0aThe theobrotion 88 is a plant found at a distance of thirty %0aschosni 89 from the river Choaspes; it represents the varied tints %0aof the peacock, and the odour of it is remarkably fine. The %0a%0a85 “ The work of his own hands,” according to Hesychius. %0a%0a86 “ Admiration of man.” It is impossible to say what plant is meant %0aunder this name, but the pieonv, Pieorna officinalis, has been suggested; %0aalso the Tropaeolum majus. Desfontaines queries whether it may not be %0athe Caesalpinia pulcherrima, a native of the East. Some authors, Fee %0asays, have identified it with the “ Moly ” of Homer. %0a%0aB7 So called from Achaemenes, the ancestor of the Persian kings. Fe'e %0athinks that it was a variety of the Euphorbia antiquorum, or else a night¬ %0ashade. 88 “ Pood for the gods.” %0a%0a89 See B. xii. c. 30; also the Introduction to Vol. III. %0a%0a%0aChap. 102.] %0a%0a%0aTHE TIIEAXGELIS. %0a%0a%0a65 %0a%0a%0akings of Persia, he says, are in the habit of taking it in their %0afood or drink, for all maladies of the body, and derangements of %0athe mind. It has the additional name of semnion, 90 from the %0ause thus made of it by majesty. %0a%0aHe next tells us of the adamantis, 91 a plant grown in %0aArmenia and Cappadocia: presented to a lion, he says, the beast %0awill fall upon its back, and drop its jaws. Its name originates %0ain the fact that it is impossible to bruise it. The arianis, 92 %0ahe say8, is found in the country of the Ariani; it is of a fiery %0acolour, and is gathered when the sun is in Leo. Wood rubbed %0awith oil will take fire on coming in contact with this plant. The %0atherionarca, 93 he tells us, grows in Cappadocia and Mysia; it %0ahas the effect of striking wild beasts of all kinds with a torpor %0awhich can only be dispelled by sprinkling them with the urine %0aof the hyaena. He speaks too of the aethiopis, 91 a plant wfiich %0agrows in Meroe; for which reason it is also known as the %0a“mero'is.” In leaf it resembles the lettuce, and, taken with %0ahonied wine, it is very good for dropsy. The ophiusa, 95 which %0ais found in Elephantine, an island also of ^Ethiopia, is a %0aplant of a livid colour, and hideous to the sight. Taken by a %0aperson in drink, he says, it inspires such a horror of serpents, %0awdiich his imagination continually represents as menacing him, %0athat he commits suicide at last; hence it is that persons guilty %0aof sacrilege are compelled to drink an infusion of it. Palm %0awine, he tells us, is the only thing that neutralizes its effects. %0a%0aThe thalassaegle 96 he speaks of as being found on the banks %0aof the river Indus, from which circumstance it is also known %0aas the potamaugis. 97 Taken in drink it produces a delirium, 98 %0awhich presents to the fancy visions of a most extraordinary %0anature. The theangelis," he says, grows upon Mount Li- %0a%0a90 “Venerable ’’ or “ majestic.” 91 “ Hard as a diamond.” %0a%0a92 The Spina Ariana is mentioned in B. xii. c. 18. %0a%0a93 See B. xx. c. 65, where a plant is mentioned by this name. %0a%0a91 Daleehamps thinks that an Euphorbia is meant under this name. %0a%0a94 “ Serpent-plant.” Fee thinks that a hemlock may possibly be meant, %0aor perhaps the Arum serpentaria ; see c. 93 of this Book. %0a%0a36 “ Brightness of the sea.” A narcotic plant. Fee thinks, probably a %0anight-shade. %0a%0a97 Hardouin suggests “potamitis,” river-plant. %0a%0a98 It is not impossible that this may in reality be an. allusion to the %0aeffects of opium, or of hasheesh. %0a%0a99 “ Messenger of the gods,” apparently. %0a%0aVOL.

An infusion of it %0ain drink, imparts powers of divination to the Magi. The %0agelotophyllis 1 too, is a plant found in Bactriana, and on the %0abanks of the Borysthenes. Taken internally with myrrh and %0awine, all sorts of visionary forms present themselves, and %0aexcite the most immoderate laughter, which can only be put %0aan end to by taking kernels of the pine-nut, with pepper and %0ahoney, in palm wine. %0a%0aThe hestiatoris, 2 he tells us, is a Persian plant, so called from %0aits promotion of gaiety and good fellowship at carousals. %0aAnother name for it is protomedia, because those who eat of it %0awill gain the highest place in the royal favour. The casignetes 1 %0atoo, we learn, is so called, because it grows only among plants %0aof its own kind, and is never found in company with any %0aother; another name given to it is “ dionysonymphas,” 4 from %0athe circumstance of its being remarkably well adapted to the %0anature of wine. Helianthes® is the name he gives to a plant %0afound in the regions of Themiscyra and the mountainous parts %0aof maritime Cilicia, with leaves like those of myrtle. This %0aplant i3 boiled up with lion’s fat, saffron and palm wine being %0aadded; the Magi, he tells us, and Persian monarchs are in %0athe habit of anointing the body with the preparation, to add %0ato its graceful appearance : he states also, that for this reason %0ait has the additional name of “ heliocallis.” 6 What the same %0aauthor calls “ hermesias,” 7 has the singular virtue of ensuring %0athe procreation of issue, both beautiful as well as good. It is %0anot a plant, however, but a composition made of kernels of %0apine nuts, pounded with honey, myrrh, saffron, and palm wine, %0ato which theobrotium 9 and milk are then added. He also %0a%0a^ “Laughingleaves.” Possibly, Fee thinks, the Ranunculus philonotis, %0athe Herba Sardoa or Sardonic plant of Virgil, known by some authorities %0aas the Apium risus, or “ laughing parsley.” Desfontaines suggests that %0ahemp (prepared in the form of hasheesh) is meant. %0a%0a2 “ Convivial ” plant. Desfontaines identifies it with the Areca catechu, %0awhich is chewed in India for the benefit of the teeth and stomach, and as a %0asweetener of the breath. %0a%0a3 “ Brother ” plant. 4 “ Bride of Dionysus or Bacchus.” %0a%0a5 “ Sun-flower.” Not the plant, however, known to us by that name. %0a%0a6 “ Beauty of the sun,” apparently. %0a%0a7 “ Mixture of Hermes,” apparently. %0a%0a8 Previously mentioned in this Chapter. %0a%0a%0aChap. 103.] %0a%0a%0aTHE ERIPHIA. %0a%0a%0a67 %0a%0a%0arecommends those who wish to become parents to drink this %0amixture, and says, that females should take it immediately %0aafter conception, and during pregnancy. 9 If this is done, he %0asays, the infant will be sure to be endowed with the highest %0aqualities, both in mind and body. In addition to what has %0ahere been stated, Democritus gives the various names by which %0aall these plants are known to the Magi. %0a%0aApollodorus, one of the followers of Democritus, has added %0ato this list the herb aeschynomene, 10 so called from the shrink¬ %0aing of its leaves at the approach of the hand; and another %0acalled “ crocis,” 11 the touch of Avhich is fatal to the phalan- %0agium. Crateuas, also, speaks of the oenotheris, 12 an infusion of %0awhich in wine, sprinkled upon them, has the effect of taming %0aall kind of animals, however wild. A celebrated grammarian, 13 %0awho lived but very recently, has described the anacampseros, 14 %0athe very touch of which recalls former love, even though %0ahatred should have succeeded in its place. It will be quite %0asufficient for the present to have said thus much in reference %0ato the remarkable virtues attributed to certain plants by the %0aMagi; as we shall have occasion to revert to this subject in a %0amore appropriate place. 19 %0a%0aCHAP. 103. (18.) -TUB ERIPHIA. %0a%0aMany authors have made mention of the eriphia, 1 * a plant %0awhich contains a kind of beetle in its hollow stem. This %0a%0a9 As Fee remarks, it has been a notion in comparatively recent times, %0athat it is possible to procreate children of either sex at pleasure. %0a%0a10 The “bashful” plant. An Acacia, Fee thinks; see B. xiii. c. 19. %0aThe Mimosa casta, pudica, and sensitive, have similar properties: the Sensi¬ %0ative Plant is well known in this country. %0a%0a11 Fee queries whether this may not be the Silene muscipula of Lin¬ %0anaeus, the nv-trap. 12 The “wine-tamer.” %0a%0a13 Hardouin thinks that he alludes to the Grammarian Apion. Dale- %0aclmmps thinks that it is either Apion or Apollodorus. %0a%0a14 The “returning” plant. Fee says that the Sedum Telephium of %0aLinnaeus, or orpine, is called in the dictionaries by this name. He queries %0awhether it may not be the Sedum anacampseros, or evergreen orpine, as %0aHesychius says that it continues to live after being taken up from the %0aearth ; a peculiarity, to some extent, of the house-leek. %0a%0a15 He probably alludes to his remarks upon Magic,in Books xxix. and xxx. %0a%0a,fi From tpi^op, a “kid.” Ruellius has attempted to identify this plant %0a%0awith one of the itanunculaccm ; but there is little doubt, as Fee says, that %0aboth plant and insect are imaginary. %0a%0aF 2 %0a%0a%0a63 %0a%0a%0apliny’s natural history. %0a%0a%0a[Book XXIY. %0a%0a%0abeetle is continually ascending tbe interior of the stalk, and %0aas often descending, while it emits a sound like the cry ol a %0akid; a circumstance to which the plant is indebted for its name. %0aThere is nothing in existence, they say, more beneficial to the %0avoice. %0a%0achap. 104. —tub wool plant: one remedy, the lactobis: %0a%0aONE REMEDY. THE MIL1TARIS: ONE REMEDY. %0a%0aThe wool plant, 17 given to sheep fasting, greatly increases the %0amilk. The plant commonly called lactoris, 18 is equally well %0aknown: it is full of a milky juice, the taste of which produces %0avomiting. Some persons say that this is identical with, while %0aothers say that it only resembles, the plant known as “mili- %0ataris,” 19 from the fact that, applied with oil, it will effect the %0acure, within five days, of any wound that has been inflicted %0awith iron. %0a%0aCHAP. 105.-THE STRATIOTES: FIVE REMEDIES. %0a%0aThe Greeks speak in high terms also of the stratiotes* %0athough that is a plant which grows in Egypt only, and during %0athe inundations of the river Nilus. It is similar in appearance %0ato the aizoon, 21 except that the leaves are larger. It is of a %0aremarkably cooling nature, and, applied with vinegar, it heals %0awounds, as well as erysipelas and suppurations. Taken in %0adrink with male frankincense, it is marvellously useful for %0adischarges of blood from the kidneys. %0a%0aCHAP. 106. (19.)—A TLANT GROWING ON THE HEAD OF A %0astatue: one remedy. %0a%0aIt is asserted also, that a plant growing 22 on the head of a %0a%0a17 “Herba lanaria.” Sec B. xix. c. 18. %0a%0a18 Hardouin identifies it with the Ulva lactuca of Linnaeus; but that %0aplant, Fee says, contains no milky juice, and does not act as an emetic. %0aOne of the Euphorbiaceae is probably meant. %0a%0a19 “ Military ” plant. Hardouin identifies it with the Achillea mille¬ %0afolium of Linnaeus, mentioned in c. 95 of this Book. Fee, however, dues %0anot recognize the identity. %0a%0a20 “Soldier” plant. C'aesalpinus identifies it with the Salvinia natans; %0abut Fee thinks, with Sprengel, that it is the Pistia stratiotes of Linnsin, %0agreat duckweed or pondweed. %0a%0a21 “ Always living.” See B. xix. c. 58. %0a%0a22 It is pretty clear that in relating this absurdity he is not speaking ot %0aone plant solely, but of any plant which may chance to grow on the head %0a%0a%0aChap. 112.] %0a%0a%0aTUB RODARUM. %0a%0a%0a(59 %0a%0a%0a6tatue, gathered in the lappet of any one of the garments, and %0athen attached with a red string to the neck, is an instantaneous %0acure for head-ache. %0a%0aCIIAP. 107.—A PLANT GROWING ON THE BANKS OF A RIVER: %0a%0aONE REMEDY. %0a%0aAny plant that is gathered before sunrise on the banks of a %0astream or river, due care being taken that no one sees it %0agathered, attached to the left arm without the patient knowing %0awhat it is, will cure a tertian fever, they say. %0a%0aCHAP. 108.-THE HERB CALLED LINGUA I ONE REMEDY. %0a%0aThere is a herb called “ lingua,” 23 which grows in the %0avicinity of fountains. The root of it, reduced to ashes and %0abeaten up with hog’s lard—the hog, they say, must have been %0ablack and barren—will cure alopecy, the head being rubbed %0awith it in the sun. %0a%0aCHAP. 109.—PLANTS THAT TAKE ROOT IN A SIEVE : ONE %0aREMEDY. %0a%0aPlants that take root in a sieve that has been thrown in %0aa hedge-row, if gathered and worn upon the person by a preg¬ %0anant woman, will facilitate delivery/ %0a%0aCUAP. 110.-PLANTS GROWING UPON DUNGHILLS: ONE REMEDY. %0a%0aA plant that has been grown upon a dungheap in a field, is %0aa very efficacious remedy, taken in water, for quinzy. %0a%0aCUAP. 111.-PLANTS THAT HAVE BEEN MOISTENED WITH THE %0a%0aURINE OF A DOG: ONE REMEDY. %0a%0aA plant upon which a dog has watered, torn up by the roots, %0aand not touched with irou, is a very speedy cure for sprains. %0a%0achap. 112.—the rodarum: three remedies. %0a%0aWe have already* 4 made mention of the rumpotinus, when %0aspeaking of the vine-growing 2 * trees.

[Book XXIV. %0a%0aaccompanied by the vine, there grows a plant, known to the %0aGauls as the “rodarum.” 26 It has a knotted stem like the %0abranch of a fig-tree, and the leaves, which are very similar to %0athose of the nettle, are white in the middle, though in process %0aof time they become red all over. The blossom of it is of a %0asilvery hue. Beaten up with stale axle-grease, due care being %0ataken not to touch it with iuon, this plant is extremely useful %0afor tumours, inflammations, and gatherings; the patient, how¬ %0aever, on being anointed with it must spit three times on the %0aright side. They say too, that as a remedy it is still more %0aefficacious, if three persons of three different nations rub the %0aright side of the body with it. %0a%0aCHAP. 113.-THE PLANT CALLED IMPIA: TWO REMEDIES. %0a%0aThe plant called “impia” 27 is white, resembling rosemary %0ain appearance. It is clothed with leaves like a thyrsus, and is %0aterminated by a head, from Avhich a number of small branches %0aprotrude, terminated, all of them, in a similar manner. It is %0athis peculiar conformation that has procured for it the name %0aof “ impia,” from the progeny thus surmounting the parent. %0aSome persons, however, are of opinion that it is so called %0abecause no animal will touch it. Bruised between two stones %0ait yields an effervescent juice, which, in combination with %0awine and milk, is remarkably efficacious for quinzy. %0a%0aThere is a marvellous property attributed to this plant, to %0athe effect that persons who have once tasted it will never he %0aattacked by quinzy; for which reason it is given to swine: %0athose among them, however, which refuse to take it will be sure %0ato die of that disease. Some persons too are of opinion that %0aif slips of it are put into a bird’s nest, they will effectually %0aprevent the young birds from choking themselves by eating too %0avoraciously. %0a%0aCHAP. 114.—THE PLANT CALLED VENUS* COMB: ONE REMEDY. %0a%0aFrom its resemblance to a comb, they give the name of %0a“ Venus’ comb” 29 to a certain plant, the root of which, bruised %0a%0aK Fee suggests that this may possibly be tbe Spiraea ulmaria of Linnam %0a%0a27 The “ impious ” or “ unnatural ” plant. Fee identifies it with the %0aFilago Gallica of Linnaeus, the corn cudweed. It is destitute of medicinal %0aproperties, and what Pliny states is without foundation. %0a%0a29 Generally identified with the Scandix pecten Veneris, corn cicely, or %0ashepherd’s needle.

The %0aherbaceous plant called “notia,” which is used by curriers %0afor dyeing leather a bright, cheerful colour, and known by %0athem under various names—is curative of cancerous ulcers; %0aI find it also stated that, taken in wine or in oxycrate, it is %0aextremely efficacious for stings inflicted by scorpions. %0a%0aCHAr. 116.-THE rniLANTUROPOS : ONE REMEDY. TUE LAPPA %0a%0aCANARIA: TWO REMEDIES. %0a%0aThe Greeks wittily give the name of “ philanthropes” 31 to a %0acertain plant, because it attaches itself to articles of dress. 33 %0aA chaplet made of this plant has the effect of relieving head¬ %0aache. %0a%0aAs to the plant known as the “lappa canaria,” 33 beaten up %0ain wine with plantago and millefolium, 34 it effects the cure of %0acarcinomatous sores, the application being removed at the end of %0athree days. Taken out of the ground without the aid of iron, %0aand thrown into their wash, or given to them in wine and milk, it %0acures diseases in swine. Some persons add, however, that the %0aperson, as he takes it up, must say—“ This is the plant arge- %0ainon, a remedy discovered by Minerva for such swine as shall %0ataste thereof.” %0a%0aCHAP. 117.-TORDYLON OR SYltEON : THREE REMEDIES. %0a%0aTordylon is, according to some authorities, the seed of sili, 36 %0awhile according to others it is a distinct plant, 36 known also %0aas “syrcon.” I find no particulars relative to it, except that %0a%0aM Fee queries whether this may not possibly be the Rhus coriaria of %0aLinnaeus, elm-leaved sumach, mentioned in B. xiii. c. 13. He would %0aappear, however, to have confounded it with the Notia, next mentioned. %0a%0a31 “ Man-loving,” or rather “ attached to man.” Identified with the %0aGalium aparine of Linnaeus, goose-grass, or common ladies bedstraw; the %0aseeds of which attach themselves to the dress. 33 See B. xxi. c. 64. %0a%0a33 The dog-bur.

It %0ais stated also, that for this last purpose the root is even more %0aefficacious than the stem ; that the juice of it, taken in doses of %0athree oboli, cures diseases of the kidneys ; and that the root is %0aused as an ingredient for emollient plasters. %0a%0aCHAP. 118. -GUAMKN : SEVENTEEN REMEDIES. %0a%0aGramen 37 is of all herbaceous productions the most common. %0aAs it creeps along the ground it throws out jointed stems, from %0athe joints of which, as well as from the extremity of the stem, %0afresh roots are put forth every here and there. In all other %0aparts of the world the leaves of it are tapering, and come to a %0apoint; but upon Mount Parnassus 38 they resemble the leaves of %0athe ivy, the plant throwing out a greater number of stems than %0aelsewhere, and bearing a blossom that is white and odoriferous. %0aThere is no vegetable production that is more grateful 39 to %0abeasts of burden than this, whether in a green state or whe¬ %0ather dried and made into hay, in which last case it is sprinkled %0awith water when given to them. It is said that on Mount %0aParnassus a juice is extracted from it, which is very abun- %0adant and of a sweet flavour. %0a%0aIn other parts of the world, instead of this juice a decoction %0aof it is employed for closing wounds; an eflect equally pro¬ %0aduced by the plant itself, which is beaten up for the purpose %0aand attached to the part affected, thereby preventing inflamma¬ %0ation. To the decoction wine and honey are added, and in some %0acases, frankincense, pepper, and myrrh, in the proportion of one %0athird of eacli ingredient; after which it is boiled again in a %0acopper vessel, when required for tooth-ache or defluxions of the %0aeyes. A decoction of the roots, in wine, is curative of griping %0apains in the bowels, strangury, and ulcerations of the bladder, %0aaud it disperses calculi. The seed is still more powerful as a %0adiuretic, 40 arrests looseness and vomiting, and is particularly %0a%0a37 “ Grass.” The Triticum repens, or Paspaluna dactylon of Linmeus, %0aour couch-grass. %0a%0a38 This is probably quite a different production, being the Parnassia %0apalustris, according to Dodonasus; but Pee is inclined to think that it is %0athe Campanula rapunculus of Linnaeus, bell-flower or rampions. %0a%0a39 pee thinks that this appplies to the plant of Parnassus, and not to %0athe common Gramen. %0a%0a40 This property, Fee says, is still attributed to couch-grass. %0a%0a%0aChap. 119.] %0a%0a%0aDACTYLOS. %0a%0a%0a73 %0a%0a%0auseful for ■wounrls inflicted by dragons. 41 There are some %0aauthorities which give the following prescription for the cuFe %0aof scrofulous sores and inflamed tumours:—From one, two, %0aor three stems, as many, as nine joints must be removed, %0awhich must then be wrapped in black wool with the grease in %0ait. The party who gathers them must do so fasting, and must %0athen go, in the same state, to the patient’s house while he is %0afrom home. When the patient comes in, the other must say to %0ahim three times, “I come fasting to bring a remedy to a fast¬ %0aing manand must then attach the amulet to his person, re¬ %0apeating the same ceremony three consecutive days. The %0avariety of this plant which has seven 42 joints is considered a %0amost excellent amulet for the cure of head-ache. For excru¬ %0aciating pains in the bladder, some recommend a decoction of %0agramen, boiled down in wine to one half, to be taken imme¬ %0adiately after the bath. %0a%0aCHAP. 119.-DACTYLOS; FIVE REMEDIES. %0a%0aThere arc some authorities who mention three varieties of %0athe pointed gramen. That which has at the extremity five 43 %0apoints at the utmost, is called “dactylos.” Twisting these %0apoints together, persons introduce them into the nostrils and then %0awithdraw them, with the view of preventing haemorrhage. %0aThe second kind, wdiich resembles aizoon, 44 is employed with %0aaxle-grease for whitlows and hangnails, and for fleshy excres¬ %0acences upon the nails: this also is called “ dactylos,” because %0ait is so useful us a remedy for diseases of the fingers. %0a%0aThe third 45 kind, which is also known as “ dactylos,” is more %0adiminutive, and is found growing upon walls or tiles. It has %0acertain caustic properties, and arrests the progress of serpigi¬ %0anous ulcers. placing a wreath of gramen round the head, %0ableeding at the nose is stopped. In Babylonia, it is said, the %0agramen 40 which grows by the wayside is fatal to camels. %0a%0a41 “Draconian.” A peculiar kind of serpent. See Lucan’s Pharsalia, %0a1). ix. 11. 727-8. > 42 No such variety is known. %0a%0a4:1 Fee is somewhat at a loss as to its identity, but thinks that it may be %0athe Panicum sanguinale of Linmeus, or possibly the Cynodon dactylon. %0a%0a44 See B. xix. c. 58, and B. xxv.c. 102. Possibly a Sedum orhouseleek, %0aF£e thinks ; certainly not a grass. %0a%0a45 Fee queries whether this may not be the Poa rigida of Linnaeus, hard %0ameadow-grass. %0a%0a46 An Euphorbia, Fee thinks. %0a%0a%0a74 %0a%0a%0aFLINT'S NATURAL HISTORY. %0a%0a%0a[Book XXIV. %0a%0a%0aCHAP. 120.-FENUGREEK OR SILICIA : THIRTY-ONE REMEDIES. %0a%0aNor is fenugreek held in less esteem. By some it is known %0aas “ telis,” by others as “ carphos,” and by others again as %0a“ buceras,” 47 or “ segoceras,” 47 the produce of it bearing some %0aresemblance to horns. Among us it is known as “ silicia.” %0aThe mode of sowing it Ave have already 48 described on the %0aappropriate occasion. Its properties are desiccative, 18 emollient, %0aand resolA-ent. A decoction of it is useful for many female %0amaladies, indurations for instance, tumours, and contractions of %0athe uterus; in all which cases it is employed as a fomentation or %0aused for a sitting-bath: it is serviceable also as an injection. %0aIt removes cutaneous eruptions on the face; and a decoction of %0ait, applied topically with nitre or vinegar, cures diseases of %0athe spleen or liver. In cases of difficult labour, Diodes re¬ %0acommends the seed pounded, in doses of one acetabulum, %0amixed with boiled 50 must. After taking one third of the mix¬ %0ature, the patient must use a warm bath, and then, while in a %0aperspiration, she must take another third, and, immediately %0aafter leaving the bath, the remainder—this, he says, will prove %0aa most effectual means of obtaining relief. %0a%0aThe same authority recommends fenugreek boiled, with %0abarley or linseed, in hydromel, as a pessary for violent pains %0ain the uterus : he prescribes it also as an external application %0afor the loAver regions of the abdomen. He speaks also of %0atreating leprous sores and freckles with a mixture composed %0aof equal proportions of sulphur and meal of fenugreek, recom¬ %0amending it to be applied repeatedly in the course of the day, %0adue care being taken not to rub the part affected. %0a%0aFor the cure of leprosy, Tlieodorus prescribes a mixture of %0afenugreek, and one fourth part of cleaned nasturtium, the whole %0ato be steeped in the strongest vinegar. Damion used to give %0aa potion by way of emmenagogue, consisting of half an aceta¬ %0abulum of fenugreek seed in nine cyathi of boiled must 51 and %0awater. There is no doubt too, that a decoction of it is re¬ %0amarkably useful for diseases of the uterus and for ulcerations %0a%0a47 “ Bull’s horn ” or “ goat’s horn.” 48 j n p xviii. c. 39. %0a%0a49 The seed contains a mucilage, and is considered emollient and resolvent %0aTill recently. Fenugreek was the base, Fee says, of a plaster held in high %0aesteem. %0a%0a50 “ Sapa.” Grape-juice boiled down to one-thud. %0a%0a61 “ Sapa.” %0a%0a%0aChap. 120.] %0a%0a%0aSUMMARY. %0a%0a%0a75 %0a%0a%0aof the intestines, and that the seed is beneficial for affections %0aof the joints and chest. Boiled with mallows and then taken %0ain honied wine, fenugreek is extolled in the highest terms, as %0aserviceable for affections of the uterus and intestines. Indeed, %0athe very steam that arises from the decoction may be produc¬ %0ative of considerable benefit. A decoction too of fenugreek seed %0ais a corrective of the rank odours of the armpits. Meal of %0afenugreek, with wine and nitre, speedily removes ring-worm %0aand dandriff of the head ; and a decoction of it in hydromel, %0awith the addition of axle-grease, is used for the cure of diseases %0aof the generative organs, inflamed tumours, imposthumes of %0athe parotid glands, gout in the feet and hands, maladies of %0athe joints, and denudations of the bones. Kneaded with %0avinegar, it effects the cure of sprains, and, boiled in oxymel %0aonly, it is used as a liniment for affections of the spleen. %0aKneaded with wine, it acts as a detergent upon carcinomatous %0asores; after which, applied with honey, it effects a perfect cure. %0aA pottage too is made of this meal, which is taken for ulcera¬ %0ations of the chest and chronic coughs; it is kept boiling a con¬ %0asiderable time, in order to remove the bitterness, 62 after which %0ahoney is added. %0a%0aWe shall now proceed to speak of the plants which have %0agained a higher degree of reputation. %0a%0aSummary. —Remedies, narratives, and observations, eleven %0ahundred and seventy-six. %0a%0aRoman authors quoted. —C.

The first %0a%3c glance tells us that the book is one on which the leisure of a busy lifetime and the whole %0a%3c %0a%3c resources of an enthusiastic author have been lavished without stint.This work is a %0a%3c %0a%3c kind of British Museum for this period and subject in small compass. It is a series of %0a%3c galleries of statues, gems, coins, documents, letters, books, and relics, through which the %0a%3c reader may wander at leisure, and which he may animate with his own musings and reflec¬ %0a%3c tions. It must be remembered throughout that this delightful and instructive collection is %0a%3c the result of the devotion of a lifetime, and deserves as much honour and recognition as %0a%3c many a museum or picture-gallery which has preserved its donor’s name for generations.” %0a%3c — Times. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c LONDON : GEORGE BELL & SONS, YORK STREET, COVENT GARDEN- %0a%3c %0a%3c ii %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c STANDARD WORKS 1'UBLISUED BY %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ILLUSTRATED OR POPULAR EDITIONS OF %0a%3c STANDARD WORKS. %0a%3c %0a%3c Dante’s Divine Comedy.

In turning over the charmingly executed hand- %0a%3c coloured plates of British plants which encumber these volumes with riches, the reader %0a%3c cannot help being struck with the beauty of many of the humblest flowering weeds we tread %0a%3c on with careless step. We cannot dwell upon many of the individuals grouped in the %0a%3c -plendid bouquet of flowers presented in these pages, and it will be sufficient to state that %0a%3c the work is pledged to contain a figure of every wild flower indigenous to these isles.”— %0a%3c Times. %0a%3c %0a%3c “ Will be the most complete Flora of Great Britain ever brought out. This great work %0a%3c will find a place wherever botanical science is cultivated,* and the study of our native %0a%3c plants, with all their fascinating associations, held dear.”— Athenaum. %0a%3c %0a%3c “ A clear, bold, distinctive type enables the reader to take in at a glance the arrangement %0a%3c and divisions of every page. And Mrs. Lankester bas added to the technical description by %0a%3c the editor an extremely Interesting popular sketch, which follow’s in smaller type. The %0a%3c English, French, and German popular names are given, and, wherever that delicate and %0a%3c difficult step is at all practicable, their derivation also. Medical properties, superstitions, %0a%3c and fancies, and poetic tributes and illusions, follow. In short there is nothing more left to %0a%3c be desired.”— Guardian. %0a%3c %0a%3c “ Without question, this is the standard work on Botany, and indispensable to every %0a%3c botanist. . . .

There is a mortal %0a%3c feud 4 existing also between the cabbage and the vine; and the %0a%3c cabbage itself, so shunned as it is by the vine, will wither im¬ %0a%3c mediately if planted in the vicinity of cyclamen 6 or of origanum. %0a%3c We find it asserted even, that aged trees fit to be felled, are %0a%3c cut with all the greater difficulty, and dry all the more rapidly, %0a%3c %0a%3c 1 See B. xvi. cc. 6, 8, 33, 50. 2 See B. xvii. c. 3. %0a%3c %0a%3c 3 As Fee justly remarks, tlie greater part of these so-called sympathies %0a%3c and antipathies must be looked upon as so many fables. In the majority of %0a%3c instances, it is the habitual requirements of the tree or plant that con¬ %0a%3c stitute the difference ; thus, for instance, the oak or quercus requires a %0a%3c different site and temperature from that needed by the olive, and the stony %0a%3c soil adopted by the vine is but ill-suited for the cultivation of the cabbage. %0a%3c %0a%3c 1 See B. xx. c. 36. %0a%3c %0a%3c 5 See B. xxi. cc. 27, 38, and B. xxv. c. 67. %0a%3c %0a%3c VOL. V. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c B %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 2 pliny’s natural HISTORY. [Book XXIV. %0a%3c %0a%3c if touched by the hand of man before the axe is applied : it %0a%3c is a common belief, too, that when their load consists ot fruit, %0a%3c beasts of burden are immediately sensible 5 6 of it, and will in¬ %0a%3c stantly begin to sweat, however trifling it may be, unless the %0a%3c fruit is duly shown to them before starting, Fennel-giant, as %0a%3c a fodder, is extremely grateful to the ass, and yet to other beasts %0a%3c of burden it is a deadly poison : hence it is that the ass is con¬ %0a%3c secrated to Father Liber , 1 * to which deity the fennel is also %0a%3c sacred. %0a%3c %0a%3c Inanimate objects again, even of the most insignificant %0a%3c character, have their own peculiar antipathies. Cooks dis¬ %0a%3c engage meat of the brine, when it has been too highly salted, %0a%3c by the agency of fine meal and the inner bark 6 of the linden- %0a%3c tree. Salt again, tends to neutralize the sickly flavour of food %0a%3c when over-sweet. The taste of water, when nitrous or bitter, %0a%3c is modified by the addition of polenta , 9 so much so indeed, as %0a%3c to be rendered potable 10 in a couple of hours : it is fora similar %0a%3c reason, too, that a layer of polenta is put 11 * in our linen wine- %0a%3c strainers. A similar property is possessed also by the chalk 13 %0a%3c of Rhodes, and the argilla of our own country. %0a%3c %0a%3c Equal affinities exist as well; pitch, for instance, is extracted %0a%3c by the agency of oil, both of them being of an unctuous nature : %0a%3c oil again, will incorporate only with lime, both of them having %0a%3c a natural antipathy 13 to water. Gum is most 14 easily removed %0a%3c with vinegar, and ink 15 with water; in addition to which, there %0a%3c %0a%3c 5 See the same statement made in B. xxiii. c. 62. %0a%3c %0a%3c 7 Or Bacchus. %0a%3c %0a%3c 8 “Philyra.” Fee does not think that it can be of any use for such a %0a%3c %0a%3c purpose. Hardouin says, however, that in his time meat when too highly %0a%3c %0a%3c salted was wrapped in leaves of the lime or linden, for the purpose of ex¬ %0a%3c tracting the salt. 9 See B. xviii. c. 14 %0a%3c %0a%3c 10 Instead of having this effect, Fee says, it would render it much worse. %0a%3c %0a%3c 11 The intention being to clear the wine, though in reality, as Fee ob¬ %0a%3c %0a%3c serves, it would have a tendency to turn the wine into vinegar. %0a%3c %0a%3c 13 Chalk, or in other words, sub-carbonate of lime, and argilla, or %0a%3c aluminous earth combining several earthy salts, would probably neutralize %0a%3c the acetic acid in the wine, but would greatly deteriorate its flavour. %0a%3c %0a%3c 13 On the contrary, lime would appear to have a great affinity for water, %0a%3c absorbing it with avidity, if we may use the term. %0a%3c %0a%3c 14 More easily with water ; though vinegar will do for the purpose. %0a%3c %0a%3c 15 “ Atramentum.” By this passage, Fee says, it is clearly proved that %0a%3c the ink of the ancients was soluble in water, arid that it contained neither %0a%3c galls nor salts of iron. What it really was made of is still a matter of %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 2.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c THE LOTUS or ITALY. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 3 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c are numberless other instances of sympathy and antipathy %0a%3c which we shall be careful to mention in their appropriate places. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is in tendencies of this description that the medical art %0a%3c first took its rise; though it was originally intended, no doubt, %0a%3c by Nature, that our only medicaments should be those which %0a%3c universally exist, are everywhere to be found, and are to be %0a%3c procured at no great outlay, the various substances, in fact, from %0a%3c which we derive our sustenance. But at a later period the %0a%3c fraudulent disposition of mankind, combined with an ingenuity %0a%3c prompted by lucre, invented those various laboratories , 16 in %0a%3c which each one of us is promised an extension of his life—that %0a%3c is, if he will pay for it. Compositions and mixtures of an in¬ %0a%3c explicable nature forthwith have their praises sung, and the %0a%3c productions of Arabia and India are held in unbounded ad¬ %0a%3c miration in the very midst 11 of us. For some trifling %0a%3c sore or other, a medicament is prescribed from the shores %0a%3c of the Red Sea ; while not a day passes but what the real %0a%3c remedies are to be found upon the tables of the very poorest %0a%3c man among us . 18 But if the remedies for diseases were %0a%3c derived from our own gardens, if the plants or shrubs were %0a%3c employed which grow there, there would be no art, forsooth, %0a%3c that would rank lower than that of medicine. %0a%3c %0a%3c Yes, avow it we must—the Roman people, in extending its %0a%3c empire, has lost sight of its ancient manners, and in that we %0a%3c have conquered we are the conquered : 19 for now we obey the %0a%3c natives of foreign 20 lands, who by the agency of a single art have %0a%3c even out-generalled our generals . 21 More, however, on this %0a%3c topic hereafter. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 2.

Some persons, after bruising the berries, %0a%3c boil them in water, till nothing appears on the surface, while %0a%3c others, again, bite the berries with the teeth, and reject the %0a%3c skins . 35 The best kind of viscus is that which has none of %0a%3c the outer skin in it, is extremely light, yellow without, ami %0a%3c of a leek-green colour within. There is no substance more %0a%3c glutinous than this: it is of an emollient nature, disperses %0a%3c tumours, and acts as a desiccative upon scrofulous sores; com¬ %0a%3c bined with resin and wax, it heals inflamed swellings of every %0a%3c description. Some persons add galbanum as well, using equal %0a%3c proportions of eacli ingredient, and this preparation they em¬ %0a%3c ploy also for the treatment of wounds. %0a%3c %0a%3c The viscus of the mistletoe has the additional property also %0a%3c of rectifying malformed nails; but to effect this it must be %0a%3c taken off at the end of seven days, and the nails must be %0a%3c washed with a solution of nitre. 33 * Some persons have a sort of %0a%3c superstitious notion that the viscus will be all the more effi¬ %0a%3c cacious if the berries are gathered from the robur at new moon, %0a%3c and without the aid of iron. They have an impression too, %0a%3c that if it has not touched the ground, it will cure epilepsy, 3 * %0a%3c that it wflll promote conception in females if they make a %0a%3c practice of carrying it about them: the berries, chewed and %0a%3c applied to ulcers, are remarkably efficacious for their cure, it is %0a%3c said. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 7.-THE EXCRESCENCES WHICH GROW ON THE ROBUR: %0a%3c %0a%3c ONE REMEDY.

They are used also for hernia, and an infu¬ %0a%3c sion of them is taken in drink . 44 They are applied with wax to %0a%3c swellings of the testes, and mixed with vinegar they stain the %0a%3c hair black . 46 Beaten up with twice the quantity of light %0a%3c bread, and then kneaded with Aminean 46 wine, they are found %0a%3c very soothing for pains in the feet and sinews. %0a%3c %0a%3c The excrescences of this tree are taken in drink for the %0a%3c stings of serpents and for discharges of blood from the mouth ; %0a%3c they are used also as a topical application for gatherings. %0a%3c Tresh-gathered and beaten up with axle-grease and bean- %0a%3c meal, they are good for hernia; and an infusion of them is %0a%3c %0a%3c 40 See B. xvi, c. 13. 41 “Ex utralibet parte.’’ %0a%3c %0a%3c 42 There is no foundation, Fee says, for any of these statements. %0a%3c %0a%3c 43 See B. xvi. c. 60. The leaves of the cypress, Fee says, contain tan¬ %0a%3c nin and an essential oil; all the medicinal properties therefore, here attri¬ %0a%3c buted to them, which are not based upon these principles, must be looked %0a%3c upon as hypothetical. %0a%3c %0a%3c 44 Down to the present century the leaves and fruit of the cypress were %0a%3c recommended in some medical works for the cure of hernia. The juice, %0a%3c however, of the leaves, taken internally, would be, as Fee says, highly %0a%3c dangerous. %0a%3c %0a%3c 45 Owing probably to the gallic acid they contain. %0a%3c %0a%3c 46 See B. xiv. c. 4. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 8 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c pliny’s natural history. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XXIV. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c taken in drink for the same complaint. In combination with %0a%3c meal, they are applied topically to imposthumes of the parotid %0a%3c glands, and to scrofulous sores. From these excrescences, %0a%3c pounded along with the seed, a juice is extracted, w'hich, mixed %0a%3c with oil, disperses films of the eyes. Taken in doses of one %0a%3c victoriatus , 47 in wine, and applied at the same time in a pulpy, %0a%3c dried fig, the seeds of which have been removed, this juice %0a%3c cures maladies of the testes and disperses tumours: mixed %0a%3c with leaven, it heals scrofulous sores. %0a%3c %0a%3c The root of the cypress, bruised wdth the leaves and taken %0a%3c in drink, is curative of diseases of the bladder, strangury, and %0a%3c the sting of the phalangium . 48 The shavings of the wood, %0a%3c taken in drink, act as an emmenagogue, and neutralize the %0a%3c venom of the scorpion. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 11.-THE CEDAR *. THIRTEEN REMEDIES. %0a%3c %0a%3c The larger cedar, known as the “ cedrelates ,” 49 produces a %0a%3c pitch called “ cedria,” which is very useful for tooth-ache, it %0a%3c having the effect of breaking 50 the teeth and extracting them, %0a%3c and so allaying the pain. We have already 51 stated how the %0a%3c juices of cedar are extracted, so remarkably useful for %0a%3c seasoning books , 52 were it not for the head-ache they produce. %0a%3c This extract from the cedar preserves 53 the bodies of the %0a%3c dead uncorrupted for ages, but exercises a noxious effect upon %0a%3c the bodies of the living—singular that there should be such a %0a%3c diversity in its properties, taking away life from animated %0a%3c %0a%3c 47 See Introduction to Vol. III. %0a%3c %0a%3c 48 See B. x. c. 28, and B. xi. cc. 24, 28. 49 See B. xiii. c. 11. %0a%3c %0a%3c 50 Fee remarks, that many of the modems attribute to frankincense the %0a%3c properties here ascribed to cedria; a most unfounded notion, he thinks. %0a%3c %0a%3c 51 In B. xiv. c, 25, and B. xvi. cc. 21, 22. %0a%3c %0a%3c 52 Sillig reads “ voluminain which case it is not improbable that the %0a%3c allusion is to the practice of seasoning the paper of manuscripts with a %0a%3c preparation of cedar, as a preservative against mildew and worms. An¬ %0a%3c other reading is “ lumina,” and it is not impossible that it is the right one, %0a%3c meaning that pitch of cedar is useful for making lamps or candles. Fee %0a%3c reminds us that we are not to confound the “ cedria ” with the “ cedrium ” %0a%3c of B. xvi. c. 21, though Pliny seems here to confound the two. See Note %0a%3c 38 to that Chapter. %0a%3c %0a%3c 53 As in B. xvi. c. 21, he has said the same of “cedrium,” a red tar %0a%3c charged with empyreumatic oil, it is clear that he erroneously identifies it %0a%3c with “ cedria,” or pitch of cedar. It is with this last, in reality, that the %0a%3c Egyptians embalmed the dead, or rather preserved them, bv dipping them %0a%3c in the boiling liquid. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 12.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c CEDRIDES. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 9 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c beings, and imparting a sort of life, as it were, to the dead ! %0a%3c It injures clothing also and destroys 54 animal life. It is for %0a%3c this reason that I cannot recommend it to be taken internally for %0a%3c the cure of quinzyand indigestion, though there are some who %0a%3c advise it: I should be greatly in dread too, to rinse the teeth %0a%3c with it, in combination with vinegar, for tooth-ache, or to use %0a%3c it as an injection for the ears in cases of hardness of hearing, or %0a%3c for worms in those organs. There is one very marvellous story %0a%3c told about it—if the male organs, they say, are rubbed with it %0a%3c just before the sexual congress, it will effectually prevent im¬ %0a%3c pregnation . 55 %0a%3c %0a%3c Still, however, I should not hesitate to employ it as a fric¬ %0a%3c tion for phthiriasis or porrigo. It is strongly recommended %0a%3c also, in raisin wine, as an antidote to the poison of the sea- %0a%3c hare , 58 but I should be more ready to use it as a liniment for %0a%3c elephantiasis. Some authors have prescribed it as an oint¬ %0a%3c ment for foul ulcers and the fleshy excrescences which grow %0a%3c in them, as also for spots and films on the eyes; and have re¬ %0a%3c commended it to be taken, in doses of one cyathus, for ulcera¬ %0a%3c tions of the lungs, and for tapeworm. %0a%3c %0a%3c There is an oil extracted from this pitch, known as “ pis- %0a%3c selaeon ,” 57 the properties of which are of increased activity %0a%3c for all the purposes before-mentioned. It is a well-known %0a%3c fact that the saw-dust of cedar will put serpents to flight, %0a%3c and that a similar effect is produced by anointing the body %0a%3c with the berries 53 bruised in oil. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 12 . -CEDRIDES: TEX REMEDIES. %0a%3c %0a%3c Cedrides, or in other words, the fruit of the cedar , 59 is %0a%3c curative of coughs, acts as a diuretic, and arrests looseness of %0a%3c the bowels. It is good also for ruptures, convulsions, %0a%3c spasms, and strangury, and is employed, as a pessary, for %0a%3c affections of the uterus. It is used also to neutralize the %0a%3c %0a%3c 54 If he implies that it is poisonous, such in reality is not the case. %0a%3c %0a%3c 55 A mere absurdity, of course. %0a%3c %0a%3c 56 It would be of no use whatever for the cure of injuries inflicted hy %0a%3c the Aplysia vulgaris or Aplysia depilans of Linnaeus.

It is applied with %0a%3c honey also, to ulcerations of the head. In combination with %0a%3c oil of roses or with nard, it is used as an injection for sup¬ %0a%3c purations of the ears; and the odour of it is useful for epilepsy, %0a%3c hysterical suffocations, and faintness at the stomach. Em¬ %0a%3c ployed as a pessary or as a fumigation, it brings away the %0a%3c foetus in cases of miscarriage; branches too of hellebore %0a%3c covered with it and laid beneath the patient, have a similar %0a%3c effect. %0a%3c %0a%3c We have already 64 stated that serpents are driven away by %0a%3c the fumes of burnt galbanum, and they will equally avoid %0a%3c persons whose body has been rubbed with it. It is curative %0a%3c also of the sting of the scorpion. In protracted deliveries, a %0a%3c piece of galbanum the size of a bean is given in one cyathus %0a%3c of wine : it has the effect also of reducing the uterus when %0a%3c displaced, and, taken with myrrh and wine, it brings away %0a%3c the dead foetus. In combination with myrrh and wine too, %0a%3c it neutralizes poisons — those which come under the de¬ %0a%3c nomination of “toxica ” 65 in particular. The very touch %0a%3c of it, mixed with oil and spondylium , 66 is sufficient to %0a%3c kill a serpent . 67 It is generally thought to be productive of %0a%3c strangury. %0a%3c %0a%3c 60 See Note 56 above.

It is of an emollient, warming, resolvent, and dis- %0a%3c pellent nature. Employed as an ingredient in eye-salves, it %0a%3c improves the sight.

Boiled with an equal proportion %0a%3c of pitch or wax, and with oil of roses, it is good for diseases of %0a%3c the joints, and for gout. Employed with honey it ripens hard %0a%3c tumours, extracts corns, and has an emollient effect upon in¬ %0a%3c durations. In combination with vinegar and Cyprian wax, %0a%3c or oil of roses, it is extremely efficacious as a liniment for %0a%3c affections of the spleen.

There are two %0a%3c principal kinds of resin, the dry and the liquid. 93 * The dry %0a%3c resins are extracted from the pine 94 and the pitch-tree, 95 the %0a%3c liquid from the terebinth, 96 the larch, 97 the lentisk, 98 and the %0a%3c cypress these last producing it in the province of Asia and %0a%3c in Syria. It is an error' to suppose that the resin of the pitch- %0a%3c tree is the same as that of the larch; for the pitch-tree yields %0a%3c an unctuous 2 resin, and of the same consistency as frankin¬ %0a%3c cense, while that of the larch is thin, like honey in colour, and %0a%3c of a powerful odour. It is but very rarely that medical men %0a%3c make use of liquid resin, and when they do, it is mostly that %0a%3c produced by the larch, which is administered in an egg for %0a%3c %0a%3c The characteristics of it differ, however, from the description here given %0a%3c hy Pliny. It is no longer used in medicine, though, like the other Euphor- %0a%3c biacece, it has very active properties. %0a%3c %0a%3c 91 This, Fee says, is consistent with truth. %0a%3c %0a%3c 92 In B. xiv. c. 25. 93 B. xvi. cc. 16, 21, 22, 23. %0a%3c %0a%3c 93 * Or, as they are called at the present day, the resins, and the oleo- %0a%3c resins, or terebinthines. %0a%3c %0a%3c 94 Fee thinks that this name extends to the numerous species of resin- %0a%3c iferous trees. 95 The Abies excelsa of Linnaeus. %0a%3c %0a%3c 96 The Pistacia terehinthus; see B. xiii. c. 12.

The resin of the pine, %0a%3c too, is far from extensively used, and that ot the other kinds %0a%3c is always boiled 3 before use : on the various methods of boiling %0a%3c it, we have enlarged at sufficient length already. 4 %0a%3c %0a%3c As to the produce of the various trees, the resin of the tere¬ %0a%3c binth is held in high esteem, as being the most odoriferous and %0a%3c the lightest, the kinds 6 which come from Cypt’us and Syria %0a%3c being looked upon as the best. Both these kinds are the %0a%3c colour of Attic honey ; but that of Cyprus has more body, and %0a%3c dries with greater rapidity. In the dry resins the qualities %0a%3c requisite are whiteness, purity, and transparency : but what¬ %0a%3c ever the kind, the produce of mountainous 6 districts is always %0a%3c preferred to that of champaign countries, and that of a north¬ %0a%3c eastern aspect to that of any other quarter. Itesins" are dis¬ %0a%3c solved in oil as a liniment and emollient cataplasm for wounds; %0a%3c but when they are used as a potion, bitter almonds 8 are also %0a%3c employed. The curative properties of resins consist in their %0a%3c tendency to close wounds, to act as a detergent upon gatherings %0a%3c and so disperse them, and to cure affections of the chest. %0a%3c %0a%3c The resin of the terebinth * * * it is used too, warmed, %0a%3c %0a%3c as a liniment for pains in the limbs, the application being re¬ %0a%3c moved after the patient has taken a walk in the sun. Among %0a%3c slave-dealers too, there is a practice of rubbing the bodies of %0a%3c the slaves with it, which is done with the greatest care, as a %0a%3c corrective for an emaciated appearance ; the resin having the %0a%3c property of relaxing the skin upon all parts of the body, and %0a%3c rendering it more capable of being plumped out by food. 9 %0a%3c %0a%3c Next after the resin of the terebinth comes that of the %0a%3c %0a%3c 3 Boiled terebinthine, or turpentine, is still used, Fee says, in medicine; %0a%3c that process disengaging the essential oil. %0a%3c %0a%3c 4 In B. xvi. c. 22. %0a%3c %0a%3c 5 Fee thinks that in reality these are terebinthines, and not resins. %0a%3c %0a%3c 6 It has been generally remarked that aromatic plants grown on moun¬ %0a%3c tains have a stronger perfume than those of the plains ; Fee queries whether %0a%3c this extends to the resins. %0a%3c %0a%3c 7 Though of little importance in modern medicine, resins and terebin¬ %0a%3c thines are still employed as the basis of certain plasters and other prepara¬ %0a%3c tions. %0a%3c %0a%3c 8 Such a potion as this, F ee says, would but ill agree with a person in %0a%3c robust health even. %0a%3c %0a%3c 9 There would be no necessity whatever, Fee says, for such a process, a %0a%3c plentiful supply of food being quite sufficient for the purpose.

The resin of the lentisk is very convenient as a ban¬ %0a%3c doline for keeping stubborn eyelashes in their place : it is %0a%3c useful also in cases of fractures, suppurations of the ears, and %0a%3c prurigo of the generative organs. The resin of the pine is the %0a%3c best of them all for the cure of wounds in the head. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 23 . ( 7 .) —PITCH : TWENTY-THREE REMEDIES. %0a%3c %0a%3c We have also stated on a previous occasion 13 from what %0a%3c tree pitch is extracted, and the methods employed for that %0a%3c purpose. Of this also there are two kinds; thick pitch and %0a%3c liquid pitch. 13 Of the several varieties of thick pitch the %0a%3c most useful for medicinal purposes is that of Bruttium ; u for %0a%3c being both extremely unctuous and very resinous, it reunites %0a%3c the properties both of resin and of pitch, that of a yellow %0a%3c reddish colour being the most highly esteemed. As to the %0a%3c statement made in addition to this, that the produce of the %0a%3c male tree is the best, I do not believe that any such distinc¬ %0a%3c tion is at all possible. %0a%3c %0a%3c Pitch is of a warming, cicatrizing tendency: mixed with %0a%3c polenta it is particularly useful as a neutralizer of the venom %0a%3c of the cerastes, 16 and in combination with honey it is used %0a%3c for quinzy, catarrhs, and fits of sneezing caused by phlegm. %0a%3c With oil of roses it is used as an injection for the ears, and %0a%3c employed as a liniment with wax it heals lichens. It relaxes 16 %0a%3c the bowels, also, and used as an electuary, or applied with %0a%3c %0a%3c 10 Mastich. The medicinal properties here attributed to it.

They have the property, too, of diminish¬ %0a%3c ing obesity, and of gradually reducing the body to a state of %0a%3c comparative emaciation, 31 the follicules being pounded in %0a%3c wine and administered in proportion to the bodily strength; %0a%3c thus, for instance, to a child, live of them are given in three %0a%3c cyathi of wine, but for persons in more robust health, seven %0a%3c are prescribed, in live cyathi of wine. %0a%3c %0a%3c We must not omit to state that the shavings and saw-dust %0a%3c of this wood are of a highly dangerous nature, according to %0a%3c some. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 31 . —THE MAPLE : ONE REMEDY. %0a%3c %0a%3c The root of the maple, 35 beaten up in wine, is extremely %0a%3c efficacious as a topical application for pains in the liver. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 32 . -THE POPLAR : EIGHT REMEDIES. %0a%3c %0a%3c Wc have already 36 mentioned, when speaking of the un¬ %0a%3c guents, the use that is made of the berries 37 of the white %0a%3c poplar.

The seed of it, taken in %0a%3c vinegar, is good for epilepsy. This tree produces a resin also %0a%3c to a small extent, which is made use of for emollient plasters. %0a%3c The leaves, boiled in vinegar, are applied topically for gout. %0a%3c A moisture that exudes from the clefts of the black poplar %0a%3c removes warts, and pimples caused by friction. Poplars %0a%3c produce also on the leaves a kind of sticky 40 juice, from which %0a%3c bees prepare their propolis: 41 indeed this juice, mixed with %0a%3c water, has the same virtues as propolis. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAT. 33.- THE ELM : SIXTEEN SEMEMES. %0a%3c %0a%3c The leaves, bark, and branches of the elm 42 have the pro¬ %0a%3c perty of filling up wounds and knitting the flesh together: %0a%3c the inner membrane 43 too, of the bark, and the leaves, steeped %0a%3c in vinegar, are applied topically for leprosy. The bark, in %0a%3c doses of one denarius, taken in one hemina of cold water, acts %0a%3c as a purgative upon the bowels, and is particularly useful for %0a%3c carrying off pituitous and aqueous humours. The gum also %0a%3c which this tree produces is applied topically to gatherings, %0a%3c wounds, and burns, which it would be as well to foment with %0a%3c the decoction also. The moisture 44 which is secreted on %0a%3c the follicules of the tree gives a finer colour to the skin, %0a%3c and improves the looks. The foot-stalks of the leaves that %0a%3c first appear, 45 boiled in wine, are curative of tumours, and %0a%3c %0a%3c 38 See also c. 38, as to the Yitex. %0a%3c %0a%3c 39 This superstition probably applies to persons riding on horseback. %0a%3c %0a%3c 10 “ Guttam.” This is the substance known to us as “ honey-dew.” %0a%3c It is either secreted by the plant itself, or deposited on the leaves by an %0a%3c aphis.

The leaves, %0a%3c however, are the only part that is made use of for ulcers upon %0a%3c infants ; chewed, too, or employed in the form of a decoction, %0a%3c they are diuretic. TJsed as a liniment they arrest menstruation %0a%3c when in excess, and an infusion of them, taken in diink, cairies %0a%3c off superfluous blood. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 35. -THE ELDER 1 FIFTEEN REMEDIES. %0a%3c %0a%3c There are two kinds of elder, one of which grows wild and %0a%3c is much smaller than the other; by the Greeks it is known as %0a%3c the “ chammacte,” or “ helion.” 49 A decoction of the leaves, 60 %0a%3c seed, or root of either kind, taken in doses of two cyathi, in %0a%3c old wine, though bad for the upper regions of the stomach, %0a%3c carries off all aqueous humours by stool. This decoction is %0a%3c very cooling too for inflammations, those attendant upon recent %0a%3c burns in particular. A poultice is made also of the more %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c « “ Extrahuntque per fistulas.” %0a%3c %0a%3c *8 See B. xvi. c. 25. The blossoms of the linden-tree are the only part %0a%3c of it employed in modern medicine. Fee thinks, with Hardouin, that %0a%3c Pliny has here attributed to the linden, or Philyra of the Greeks, the pro¬ %0a%3c perties which in reality were supposed to belong to the Phillyrea latifolia, %0a%3c a shrub resembling the wild olive. Dioscondes, in Ins description of its %0a%3c properties, has not fallen into the same error. , . . T . %0a%3c %0a%3c 49 “ Ground elder ” or “marsh elder the' Sambucus ebulus of Lin- %0a%3c %0a%3c nceus, or dwarf elder. The other kind mentioned by Pliny is the Sambu¬ %0a%3c cus nigra of Linnaeus, or black elder. ,. . . %0a%3c %0a%3c 50 Fee says that though some of the assertions as to its medicinal pro¬ %0a%3c perties made by Pliny are unfounded, it is still an opinion among the %0a%3c moderns that the leaves of the elder are purgative, the inner bark an %0a%3c emetic and bydragogue, the berries laxative, and the flowers emollient. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 24 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c PLINY’S NATURAE HISTORY. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XXIV. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c tender leaves, mixed with polenta, for bites inflicted bj' dogs. %0a%3c The juice of the elder, used as a fomentation, reduces abscesses %0a%3c of the brain, and more particularly of the membrane which %0a%3c envelopes that organ. The berries, which have not so power¬ %0a%3c ful an action as the other parts of the tree, stain the hair. %0a%3c Taken in doses of one acetabulum, in drink, they are diuretic. %0a%3c The softer leaves are eaten with oil and salt, to carry oft %0a%3c pituitous and bilious secretions. %0a%3c %0a%3c The smaller kind is for all these purposes the more efficacious %0a%3c of the two. A decoction of the root in wine, taken in doses %0a%3c of two cyathi, brings away the water in dropsy, and acts %0a%3c emolliently upon the uterus: the same effects are produced %0a%3c also by a sitting-bath made of a decoction of the leaves. %0a%3c The tender shoots of the cultivated kind, boiled in a saucepan %0a%3c and eaten as food, have a purgative effect: the leaves taken in %0a%3c wine, neutralize the venom of serpents. An application of %0a%3c the young shoots, mixed with he-goat suet, is remarkably good %0a%3c for gout; and if they are macerated in water, the infusion will %0a%3c destroy fleas. If a decoction of the leaves is sprinkled about %0a%3c a place, it will exterminate flies. “ Boa ” 61 is the name given %0a%3c to a malady which appears in the form of red pimples upon %0a%3c the body ; for its cure the patient is scourged with a branch of %0a%3c elder. The inner bark, 52 pounded and taken with white wine, %0a%3c relaxes the bowels. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 36.- THE JUNIPER : TWENTY-ONE REMEDIES. %0a%3c %0a%3c The juniper is of a warming and resolvent nature beyond %0a%3c all other plants :. in other respects, it resembles the cedar. 55 %0a%3c There are two species of this tree, also, one of which is larger 5 * %0a%3c than the other : 55 the odour of either, burnt, repels the ap- %0a%3c %0a%3c 41 According to Hardouin, this would appear to be the measles; but ac¬ %0a%3c cording to Festus, swellings on the legs were so called. The shingles is %0a%3c probably the malady meant. %0a%3c %0a%3c 52 Fee speaks of a decoction of the inner bark as having been recently %0a%3c %0a%3c in vogue for the cure of dropsy. ’ %0a%3c %0a%3c 53 This so-called cedar, Fee says, isin reality itself a juniper. The medici¬ %0a%3c nal properties of all the varieties of the juniper are not identical. Theessen- %0a%3c tial oil of the leaves acts with a formidable energy upon the human system. %0a%3c %0a%3c ^ This is identified by Fee with the Juniperus communis of Lamarck, %0a%3c variety a, the Juniperus communis of Linnmus. %0a%3c %0a%3c 55 Identified by Fee with the Juniperus nana of Willdenow the Juni¬ %0a%3c perus communis of Lamarck, variety /3.

Ap¬ %0a%3c plied topically, it checks the growth of tumours ; and the %0a%3c berries, taken in red wine, act astringently upon the bowels : %0a%3c they are applied also to tumours of the abdomen. The seed %0a%3c is used as an ingredient in antidotes of an aperient nature, and %0a%3c is diuretic 58 in its effects. It is used as a liniment for de¬ %0a%3c fluxions of the eyes, and is prescribed for convulsions, rup¬ %0a%3c tures, griping pains in the bowels, affections of the uterus, %0a%3c and sciatica, either in a dose of four berries in white wine, or %0a%3c in the form of a decoction of twenty berries in wine. %0a%3c %0a%3c There are persons who rub the body with juniper berries as %0a%3c a preventive of the attacks of serpents. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 37. (9.) -THE WILLOW : FOURTEEN REMEDIES. THF. %0a%3c %0a%3c WILLOW OF AMERIA: ONE REMEDY. %0a%3c %0a%3c The fruit of the willow, 59 before it arrives at maturity, is %0a%3c covered with a down like a spider’s web : gathered 60 before it %0a%3c is ripe, it arrests discharges of blood from the mouth. The %0a%3c bark of the upper branches, reduced to ashes and mixed with %0a%3c water, is curative of corns and callosities: it removes spots %0a%3c also upon the face, being still more efficacious for that purpose %0a%3c if mixed with the juices of the. tree. %0a%3c %0a%3c The juices produced by the willow form three different %0a%3c varieties ; one 61 of which exudes in the shape of a gum from %0a%3c %0a%3c 46 Virgil says this of the fumes of the cedar, Georg. III. 414; an %0a%3c additional proof, Fee says, that under the name of “ cedrus,” the juniper %0a%3c was really meant. The smoke of the juniper is not known to have the %0a%3c effect upon serpents here described. %0a%3c %0a%3c 57 The berries of the juniper contain sugar, mucilage, and a small pro¬ %0a%3c portion of essential oil; a rob is prepared from them, Fee says, under the %0a%3c name of “extract of juniper.” %0a%3c %0a%3c 58 It is a well-known fact, that juniper berries are diuretic ; they impart %0a%3c also to the urine the odour of the violet, a property which is equally pos¬ %0a%3c sessed by turpentine. All the other properties here attributed to the %0a%3c juniper, are, in F£e’s opinion, either hypothetical or absurd. %0a%3c %0a%3c 59 See B. xvi. c. 68. %0a%3c %0a%3c 60 Neither this downy substance nor the seeds are now employed for %0a%3c any purpose. The bark of the willow has some strongly-pronounced pro¬ %0a%3c perties, but all other parts of it are totally inert. %0a%3c %0a%3c 61 A kind of manna, Fee says. The other juices here mentioned are %0a%3c secreted from the sap. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 26 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Flint’s natural history. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XXIV. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c the tree itself, and another distils from an incision some three %0a%3c fingers in width, made in the bark while the tree is in blossom. %0a%3c This last is very useful for dispersing humours which impede %0a%3c the sight, acting also as an inspissative when needed, promoting %0a%3c the discharge of the urine, and bringing abscesses of all kinds %0a%3c to a head. The third kind of juice exudes from the wounds, %0a%3c when the branches are lopt off w’ith the bill. Either of these %0a%3c juices, warmed in a pomegranate rind, is used as an injection %0a%3c for diseases of the ears. The leaves, too, boiled and beaten %0a%3c up with wax, are employed as a liniment for similar purposes, %0a%3c and for gout. The bark and leaves, boiled in wine, form a %0a%3c decoction that is remarkably useful as a fomentation for affec¬ %0a%3c tions of the sinews. The blossoms, bruised with the leaves, %0a%3c remove scaly eruptions of the face; and the leaves, bruised and %0a%3c taken in drink, check libidinous tendencies, 62 and effectually %0a%3c put an end to them, if habitually employed. %0a%3c %0a%3c The seed of the black willow of Ameria, 63 mixed with %0a%3c litharge in equal proportions, and applied to the body just %0a%3c after the bath, acts as a depilatory. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAT. 38.- THE VITEX : THIRTY-THREE REMEDIES. %0a%3c %0a%3c Not much unlike the willow, for the use that is made of it %0a%3c in wicker-work, is the vitex, 64 which also resembles it in the %0a%3c leaves and general appearance, though the smell of it is more %0a%3c agreeable. The Greeks call it “ lygos,” or “ agnos,” 65 from %0a%3c the fact that the matrons of Athens, during the Thesmo- %0a%3c phoria, 66 a period w'hen the strictest chastity is observed, are %0a%3c in the habit of strewing their beds with the leaves of this tree. %0a%3c %0a%3c There are two species of vitex : the larger 67 one, like the %0a%3c willow, attains the full proportions of a tree ; while the other, 66 %0a%3c which is smaller, is branchy, with a paler, downy leaf. The %0a%3c first kind, generally known as the “ white ” vitex, bears a %0a%3c %0a%3c 63 The leaves have no effect whatever as an antaphrodisiac. %0a%3c %0a%3c 03 See B. xvi. c. 69. %0a%3c %0a%3c 64 The Vitex agnus castus of Linnaeus, the tree of chastity. %0a%3c %0a%3c 65 The “chaste” tree.

Both of these trees grow on %0a%3c level spots of a marshy nature. %0a%3c %0a%3c The seed of these trees, taken in drink, has a sort of vinous %0a%3c flavour, and has the reputation of being a febrifuge. It is %0a%3c said also to act as a sudorific, if the body is rubbed with it %0a%3c mixed with oil, and to have the effect of dispelling extreme %0a%3c lassitude : it acts too as a diuretic 69 and emmenagogue. The %0a%3c produce of both trees is trying to the head, like wine, and %0a%3c indeed the odour of them is very similar. They have the %0a%3c effect also of removing flatulence in the lower regions of the %0a%3c body, act astringently upon the bowels, and are remarkably %0a%3c useful for dropsy and affections of the spleen. They promote %0a%3c the secretion of the milk, and neutralize the venom of serpents, %0a%3c when of a cold nature more particularly. The smaller kind, %0a%3c however, is the more efficacious of the two for injuries inflicted %0a%3c by serpents, the seed being taken in doses of one drachma, in %0a%3c wine or oxycrate, or else the more tender leaves in doses of two %0a%3c drachmae. %0a%3c %0a%3c From both trees also a liniment is prepared for the bites of %0a%3c spiders, but it is quite sufficient to rub the wounds with the %0a%3c leaves; and if a fumigation is made from them, or if they are %0a%3c spread beneath the bed, they will repel the attacks of all %0a%3c venomous creatures. They act also as an antaphrodisiac, and %0a%3c it is by this tendency in particular that they neutralize the %0a%3c venom of the phalangium, the bite of which has an exciting %0a%3c effect upon the generative organs. The blossoms and young %0a%3c shoots, mixed with oil of roses, allay head-aches arising from %0a%3c inebriation. A decoction of the seed used as a fomentation %0a%3c cures head-ache, however intense it may be ; and employed as %0a%3c a fumigation or as a pessary, the seeds acts as a detergent %0a%3c upon the uterus. Taken in drink with honey and penny-royal, %0a%3c it has a laxative effect; pounded and used with barley-meal, %0a%3c it quickly brings abscesses and hard tumours to a head, and %0a%3c has an emollient effect. %0a%3c %0a%3c The seed, in combination with saltpetre and vinegar, removes %0a%3c lichens and freckles; mixed with honey, it heals ulcers and %0a%3c eruptions of the mouth ; applied with butter and vine-leaves, %0a%3c it reduces swellings of the testes ; used with water, as a lini- %0a%3c %0a%3c 69 It may possibly, Fee says, have tbis effect, but the other properties %0a%3c here attributed to it are wholly imaginary. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 28 pliny’s natural htstory.

It is as strongly drastic 78 as hellebore, and is usually- %0a%3c taken fasting, in doses of one drachma and a half, in four %0a%3c cyathi of hydromel. The branches also, with the foliage, are %0a%3c macerated for several days in vinegar, and are then beaten up, %0a%3c the infusion being recommended for sciatica, in doses of one %0a%3c cyathus. Some persons think it a better plan, however, to %0a%3c make an infusion of them in sea-water, and to inject it as a %0a%3c clyster. The juice of them is used also as a friction for sciatica, %0a%3c with the addition of oil. Some medical men, too, make use %0a%3c of the seed for strangury.

I %0a%3c would here remark, parenthetically, that some persons identify %0a%3c it with the tamarice. Be this as it may, it is particularly %0a%3c useful for affections of the spleen, the juice of it being ex¬ %0a%3c tracted for the purpose, and taken in wine; indeed so marvellous, %0a%3c they say, is its antipathy to this part of the viscera, and this %0a%3c only, that if swine drink from troughs made of this wood, 61 %0a%3c they will be found to lose the spleen. Hence it is that %0a%3c %0a%3c 18 Fee says that the blossoms and seed of the juncifovm genista and %0a%3c other kinds are of a purgative nature; indeed, one variety has been called %0a%3c the Genista purgans by Lamarck. None of them, however, are so potent %0a%3c in their effects as Pliny in the present passage would lead us to suppose. %0a%3c %0a%3c 79 See B. xiii. c. 37, and Note 96; where it is stated that, in Fee’s %0a%3c opinion, several plants were united by the ancients under this one collective %0a%3c name—brooms for instance, heaths, and tamarisks. He thinks, however, %0a%3c that under the name “ Myrica,” Pliny may possibly have intended to com¬ %0a%3c prehend the larger heaths and the Tamarix Gallica of Linnaeus. M. Fraas, as %0a%3c Little states, gives the Tamarix Africana as the probable synonym of the %0a%3c Myrica of Pliny. %0a%3c %0a%3c 8,1 Of this broom-plant of Ameria nothing is known. %0a%3c %0a%3c 81 This cannot apply to any of the heaths of Europe.

The %0a%3c common people, as already 83 stated, look upon this tree as ill- %0a%3c omened, because it bears no fruit, and is never propagated %0a%3c from seed. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 42. -THE BRYA : TWENTY-NINE REMEDIES. %0a%3c %0a%3c At Corinth, and in the vicinity of that city, the Greeks give %0a%3c the name of “ brya” 81 to a plant of which there are two %0a%3c varieties ; the wild brya, 85 which is altogether barren, and the %0a%3c cultivated one. 86 This last, when found in Syria and Egypt, %0a%3c produces a ligneous fruit, somewhat larger than a gall-nut, in %0a%3c great abundance, and of an acrid flavour; medical men employ %0a%3c it as a substitute for galls in the compositions known as %0a%3c “ anther®.” 87 The wood also, with the blossoms, leaves, and %0a%3c bark of the tree, is used for similar purposes, but their pro¬ %0a%3c perties are not so strongly developed. The bark is pounded %0a%3c also, and given for 88 discharges of blood from the mouth, irre¬ %0a%3c gularities of the catamenia, and coeliac affections : beaten up %0a%3c and applied to the part affected, it checks the increase of all %0a%3c kinds of abscesses. %0a%3c %0a%3c The juice too is extracted from the leaves for similar pur¬ %0a%3c poses, and a decoction is made of them in wine; they are ap¬ %0a%3c plied also to gangrenes, in combination with honey. A de¬ %0a%3c coction of them taken in wine, or the leaves themselves ap¬ %0a%3c plied with oil of roses and wax, has a sedative effect: it is in %0a%3c this form that they are used for the cure of epinyctis.

The seed, in doses of one drachma, is administered in %0a%3c drink for injuries inflicted by spiders or the phalangium; and %0a%3c mixed with the grease of poultry, it is applied to boils. It is %0a%3c very efficacious also for stings inflicted by all kinds of ser¬ %0a%3c pents, the asp excepted. The decoction, used as a fomentation, %0a%3c is curative of jaundice, phthiriasis, and lice; it also arrests %0a%3c the catamenia when in excess. The ashes of the tree are %0a%3c employed for all these purposes; there is a story told, too, %0a%3c that, mixed with the urine of an ox, and taken in the food or %0a%3c drink, they will act most effectually as an antaphrodisiac. %0a%3c The charcoal too of this wood is quenched in urine of a similar %0a%3c nature, and kept in a shady spot.

THIRTY-NINE %0a%3c %0a%3c REMEDIES. %0a%3c %0a%3c We have already 95 enumerated some twenty varieties of the %0a%3c ivy. The medicinal properties of them all are of a doubtful %0a%3c nature; taken in considerable quantities they disturb the %0a%3c mental faculties and purge the brain. Taken internally they %0a%3c are injurious to the sinews, 96 but applied topically they are %0a%3c beneficial to those parts of the body. Ivy possesses properties %0a%3c similar 91 to those of vinegar. All the varieties of the ivy are %0a%3c of a refrigerative nature, and taken in drink they are diuretic. %0a%3c The softer leaves, applied to the head, allay head-ache, acting %0a%3c more particularly upon the brain and the membrane which %0a%3c envelopes that organ. For this purpose the leaves are bruised %0a%3c with vinegar and oil of roses and then boiled, after which some %0a%3c more rose-oil is added. The leaves too are applied to the fore- %0a%3c %0a%3c 93 See B. xii. c. >51. The botanical characteristics, Fee says, and the %0a%3c medicinal properties of the privet, differ essentially from those of theCypros %0a%3c or Lawsonia inermis. The leaves of the privet are bitter and astringent. %0a%3c %0a%3c 91 Fee says, that on reading this passage it is impossible to preserve one's %0a%3c gravity. %0a%3c %0a%3c 95 In B. xvi. c. 62. The ivy is but little used for any of the purposes %0a%3c of modern medicine. It is said by some authorities that a decoction of the %0a%3c leaves will kill vermin, and that the berries are purgative and emetic. %0a%3c %0a%3c 36 %3c%3c Nervis.” %0a%3c %0a%3c 37 Fee states that in reality no such similarity exists; but that acetic acid %0a%3c is sometimes developed by the rapid fermentation of the juices of a great %0a%3c number of vegetable substances. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 47.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c THE IVY. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 33 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c head, and the mouth is fomented with a decoction of them, with %0a%3c which the head is rubbed as well. They are useful also for %0a%3c the spleen, the leaves being applied topically, or an infusion %0a%3c of them taken in drink. A decoction of them is used for %0a%3c cold shiverings in fevers, and for pituitous eruptions ; or else %0a%3c they are beaten up in wine for the purpose. The umbels too, %0a%3c taken in drink or applied externally, are good for affections of %0a%3c the spleen, and an application of them is useful for the liver ; %0a%3c employed as a pessary, they act as an emmenagogue, %0a%3c %0a%3c The juice of the ivy, the white cultivated kind more par¬ %0a%3c ticularly, cures diseases of the nostrils and removes habitually %0a%3c offensive smells. Injected into the nostrils it purges the head, %0a%3c and with the addition of nitre it is still more efficacious for that %0a%3c purpose. In combination with oil, the juice is injected for %0a%3c suppurations or pains in the ears. It is a corrective also of the %0a%3c deformities of scars. The juice of white ivy, heated with the %0a%3c aid of iron, is still more efficacious for affections of the spleen; %0a%3c it will be found sufficient, however, to take six of the berries in %0a%3c two cyathi of wine. Three berries of the white ivy, taken in %0a%3c oxymel, expel tape-worm, and in the treatment of 6uch cases %0a%3c it is a good plan to apply them to the abdomen as well. %0a%3c Erasistratus prescribes twenty of the golden-coloured berries of %0a%3c the ivy which we have-mentioned as the “ chrysocarpos,” 96 to be %0a%3c beaten up in one sextarius of wine, and he says that if three %0a%3c cyathi of this preparation are taken for dropsy, it will carry off %0a%3c by urine the water that has been secreted beneath the skin. %0a%3c For cases of tooth-ache he recommends five berries of the %0a%3c chrysocarpos to be beaten up in oil of roses, and warmed in a %0a%3c pomegranate-rind, and then injected into the ear opposite the %0a%3c side affected. The berries which yield a juice of a saffron %0a%3c colour, taken beforehand in drink, are a preservative against %0a%3c crapulence ; they are curative also of spitting of blood and of %0a%3c griping pains in the bowels. The whiter umbels of the black %0a%3c ivy, taken in drink, are productive of sterility, in males even. %0a%3c A decoction in wine of any kind of ivy is useful as a liniment %0a%3c for all sorts of ulcers, those even of the malignant kind known %0a%3c as “ cacoethes.” The tears" which distil from the ivy are used %0a%3c %0a%3c 98 “ Golden fruit.” See B. xvi. c. 62. %0a%3c %0a%3c 99 The same substance which he speaks of at the end of this Chapter as %0a%3c the gum of ivy, called “ hederine,” Fee says, in modern chemistry.

The umbels stain the hair black. The %0a%3c juice extracted from the root is taken in vinegar for the cure %0a%3c of wounds inflicted by the phalangium. I find it stated too, %0a%3c that patients suffering from affections of the spleen are cured %0a%3c by drinking from vessels made of the wood of the ivy. The %0a%3c berries are bruised also, and then burnt, and a liniment is %0a%3c prepared from them for burns, the parts being fomented with %0a%3c warm -water first. %0a%3c %0a%3c Incisions are sometimes made in the ivy to obtain the juice, %0a%3c which is used for carious teeth, it having the effect of breaking %0a%3c them, it is said ; the adjoining teeth being fortified with wax %0a%3c against the powerful action of the juice.

There are two varieties of this plant ; the male, 1 %0a%3c which has a rose-coloured blossom, and the female, 2 with a %0a%3c white one.

Taken in a similar manner %0a%3c twice a day, it is curative of inveterate ulcers: used with %0a%3c wax, it heals burns, and employed by itself it cures ulcer¬ %0a%3c ations of the mouth.

The berries, it is said, are of so powerful a nature %0a%3c as to produce bloody urine. “ Chamaecissos ” 5 also is a name %0a%3c given by them to a creeping ivy which never rises from the %0a%3c surface of the ground : bruised in wine, in doses of one ace¬ %0a%3c tabulum, it is curative of affections of the spleen, the leaves %0a%3c of it being applied topically with axle-grease to bums. %0a%3c %0a%3c The smilax 6 also, otherwise known as the “ anthophoros,” 7 %0a%3c has a strong resemblance to ivy, but the leaves of it are smaller. %0a%3c A chaplet, they say, made of an uneven number of the leaves, %0a%3c is an effectual cure for head-ache. Some writers mention two %0a%3c kinds of smilax, one of which is all but perennial, and is found %0a%3c climbing the trees in umbrageous valleys, the berries hanging %0a%3c in clusters. These berries, they say, are remarkably efficacious %0a%3c for all kinds of poisons; so much so indeed, that infants to %0a%3c whom the juice of them has been habitually administered, are %0a%3c rendered proof against all poisons for tbe rest of their life. %0a%3c The other kind, it is said, manifests a predilection for cultivated %0a%3c localities, and is often found growing there; but as for medicinal %0a%3c properties, it has none. The former kind, they say, is the %0a%3c smilax, the wood of which we have mentioned 8 as emitting a %0a%3c sound, if held close to the ear. %0a%3c %0a%3c Another plant, similar to this, they call by the name of %0a%3c “ clematis :” 9 it is found adhering to trees, and has a jointed %0a%3c stem. The leaves of it cleanse leprous 10 sores, and the seed %0a%3c acts as an aperient, taken in doses of one acetabulum, in one %0a%3c hemina of water, or in hydromel. A decoction of it is pre¬ %0a%3c scribed also for a similar purpose. %0a%3c %0a%3c chap. 50. (11.)—the heed: nineteen kehedies. %0a%3c %0a%3c We have already 11 treated of twenty-nine varieties of the %0a%3c reed, and there is none of her productions in which that %0a%3c %0a%3c 5 “ Ground-ivy.” See B. xvi. c. 62, Note 17. M. Fraas adopts %0a%3c Sprengel’s opinion that it is the Antirrhinum Azarina, the bastard asarum. %0a%3c %0a%3c 6 See B. xvi. c. 63. 1 “ Flower-bearer.” %0a%3c %0a%3c 8 In B. xvi. c. 63. %0a%3c %0a%3c 9 Sprengel thinks that this is the Clematis viticella, but Fee identifies %0a%3c %0a%3c it with the Clematis vitalba of Linnaeus, the climber, or traveller’s joy. %0a%3c %0a%3c 10 The leaves of it, Fee says, are of a caustic nature, and have been %0a%3c employed before now by impostors for producing sores on the skin of a %0a%3c frightful appearance, but easily healed. %0a%3c %0a%3c 11 In B. xvi. c. 34. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 36 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c pliny’s natural iiistoky. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XXIV. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c might)' power of Nature , 12 which in our successive Books we %0a%3c have described, is more fully displayed than in this. I he %0a%3c root of the reed, pounded and applied to the part affected, %0a%3c extracts the priekles of fern from the body, the root ol the %0a%3c fern having a similar effect upon splinters of the refed. Among %0a%3c the numerous varieties which we have described, the scented %0a%3c reed 1 * which is grown in Judaea and Syria as an ingredient in %0a%3c our unguents, boiled with hay-grass or parsley-seed, has a %0a%3c diuretic effect: employed as a pessary, it acts as an emmena- %0a%3c gogue. Taken in drink, in doses of two oboli, it is curative %0a%3c of convulsions, diseases of the liver and kidneys, and dropsy. %0a%3c Used as a fumigation, and with resin more particularly, it is %0a%3c good for coughs, and a decoction of it with myrrh is useful for %0a%3c scaly eruptions and running ulcers. A juice, too, is collected %0a%3c from it which has similar properties to those of elaterium . 11 %0a%3c %0a%3c In every kind of reed the part that is the most efficacious is %0a%3c that which lies nearest the root; the joints also are efficacious %0a%3c in a high degree. The ashes of the Cyprian reed known as %0a%3c the “ donax ,” 14 are curative of alopecy and putrid ulcers. %0a%3c The leaves of it are also used for the extraction 18 of pointed %0a%3c bodies from the flesh, and for erysipelas and all kinds of %0a%3c gatherings. The common reed, beaten up quite fresh, has %0a%3c also considerable extractive powers, and not in the root only, %0a%3c for the stem, it is said, has a similar property. The root is %0a%3c used also in vinegar as a topical application for sprains and %0a%3c for pains in the spine; and beaten up fresh and taken in wine it %0a%3c acts as an aphrodisiac. The down that grows on reeds, put %0a%3c into the ears, deadens the hearing . 17 %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 51.- THE PAPYRUS, AND THE PAPER MADE FROM IT: %0a%3c %0a%3c THREE REMEDIES. %0a%3c %0a%3c Of a kindred nature with the reed is the papyrus 18 of %0a%3c Egypt; a plant that is remarkably useful, in a dried state, for %0a%3c %0a%3c n Sympathies and antipathies existing in plants. Seec. 1 of this Book. %0a%3c %0a%3c 13 Not a reed, Fee thinks, but some other monocotyledon that has not %0a%3c been identified. See B. xii. e. 48. %0a%3c %0a%3c 14 See B. xx. c. 3. 15 See B. xvi. c. 66. %0a%3c %0a%3c 16 Celsus also speaks of the root of the reed as being efficacious for this %0a%3c purpose, B. v. c. 26. %0a%3c %0a%3c ,7 Fee says that neither of these last assertions is true. %0a%3c %0a%3c 13 See B. xiii. c. 21.

The %0a%3c ashes 19 of paper prepared from the papyrus are reckoned among %0a%3c the caustics: those of the plant, taken in wine, have a %0a%3c narcotic effect. The plant, applied topically in water, removes %0a%3c callosities of the skin. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 52 . -THE EBONY : FIVE Bl'HEDIES. %0a%3c %0a%3c The ebony-tree 20 does not grow in Egypt even, as we have %0a%3c already stated, and it is not our intention to speak here of the %0a%3c medicinal properties of the vegetable productions of foreign cli¬ %0a%3c mates. Still, however, the ebony must not be omitted, on %0a%3c account of the marvels related of it. The saw-dust of this %0a%3c wood, it is said, is a sovereign remedy for diseases of the eyes, %0a%3c and the pulp of the wood, rubbed upon a whetstone moistened %0a%3c with raisin wine, dispels all films which impede the sight. %0a%3c The root too, they say, applied with water, is curative of %0a%3c white specks in the eyes, and, with the addition of root of %0a%3c dracunculus , 21 in equal proportions, and of honey, of cough. %0a%3c Medical men reckon ebony also in the number of the caustics . 22 %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 53 -THE RHODODENDRON : ONE REMEDY. %0a%3c %0a%3c The rhododendron 23 has not sq much as found a Latin name %0a%3c among us, its other names being “ rhododaphne ” 24 and %0a%3c “ nerium.” It is a marvellous fact, but the leaves 26 of this %0a%3c plant are poisonous to quadrupeds ; while for man, if taken in %0a%3c wine with rue, they are an effectual preservative against the %0a%3c venom of serpents. Sheep too, and goats, it is said, if they %0a%3c drink water in which the leaves have been steeped, will die %0a%3c immediately. %0a%3c %0a%3c 19 These statements as to the virtues of the ashes of papyrus, F6e says, %0a%3c are absurd. %0a%3c %0a%3c 20 See B. xii. c. 8. Desfontaines is inclined to identify the tree here %0a%3c spoken of with the Diospyros ebenaster of Koenig. %0a%3c %0a%3c 21 See c. 91 of this Book ; the Artemisia dracunculus of Linnaeus. %0a%3c %0a%3c 22 “ Erodentia.” Fee remasks upon the singularity, that with this %0a%3c property attributed to it, it should be recommended for diseases of the eyes. %0a%3c %0a%3c 23 The “rose-tree.” Our rose-bay or oleander. 24 “ Rose-laiyel %0a%3c %0a%3c 25 See B. xvi. c. 33.

STOMATICE. %0a%3c %0a%3c Jlor yet has the tree called “rhus ” 28 any Latin name, al¬ %0a%3c though it is employed in numerous ways. Under this name %0a%3c are comprehended a wild plant , 27 with leaves like those of %0a%3c myrtle, and a short stem, which is good as an expellent of %0a%3c tapeworm ; and the shrub 28 which is known as the “ currier’s %0a%3c plant,” of a reddish colour, a cubit in height, and about the %0a%3c thickness of one’s finger, the leaves of which are dried and %0a%3c used, like pomegranate rind, for curing leather. %0a%3c %0a%3c Medical men also employ the leaves of these plants for the %0a%3c treatment of contusions, and for the cure of coeliac affections, %0a%3c and of ulcers of the rectum and phagedaenic sores ; for all which %0a%3c purposes they are pounded with honey and applied with %0a%3c vinegar. A decoction of them is injected for suppurations of %0a%3c the ears. With the branches, boiled, a stomatice 29 is also made, %0a%3c which is used for the same purposes as that prepared from %0a%3c mulberries ; 3U it is more efficacious, however, mixed with alum. %0a%3c This preparation is applied also to reduce the swelling in dropsy. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 55 . -RHUS ERTTHUOS : NINE REMEDIES. %0a%3c %0a%3c Ehus 31 erythros is the name given to the seed of this shrub. %0a%3c It possesses properties of an astringent and cooling nature, and %0a%3c is used as a seasoning 32 for provisions, in place of salt. It has %0a%3c a laxative effect, and, used in conjunction with silphium, it %0a%3c gives a finer flavour to meat of all kinds. Mixed with honey, %0a%3c it is curative of running ulcers, pimples on the tongue , 33 con¬ %0a%3c tusions, bruises, and excoriations. It causes ulcers of the %0a%3c head to cicatrize with the greatest rapidity ; and taken with %0a%3c the food, it arrests excessive menstruation. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 56 . -THE ERYTHRODANUS : ELEVEN REMEDIES. %0a%3c %0a%3c The erythrodanus , 31 by some called “ ereuthodanus,” and %0a%3c %0a%3c See B. xiii. c. 13.

It is used for %0a%3c dyeing wool, and skins for leather are prepared with it. Used %0a%3c medicinally, it is a diuretic, and, employed with hydromel, it %0a%3c is curative of jaundice . 35 Employed topically with vinegar, %0a%3c it heals lichens ; and a potion is prepared from it for sciatica %0a%3c and paralysis, the patient while using it taking a hath daily. %0a%3c The root of it and the seed are effectual as an emmenagogue ; %0a%3c they act astringently upon the bowels, and disperse gatherings. %0a%3c The branches, together with the leaves, are applied to wounds %0a%3c inflicted by serpents; the leaves too have the property of %0a%3c staining the hair . 36 I find it stated by some writers that this %0a%3c shrub is curative of jaundice, even if worn as an amulet only, %0a%3c and looked at every now and then. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAF. 57 .- THE ALYSSON '. TWO REMEDIES. %0a%3c %0a%3c The plant known as the “ alysson ” 37 differs only from the %0a%3c preceding one in the leaves and branches, which are more di¬ %0a%3c minutive. It receives its name from the fact, that, taken in %0a%3c vinegar and worn as an amulet, it prevents persons bitten by %0a%3c dogs from becoming rabid. It is a marvellous fact too, that is %0a%3c added, to the effect that the person bitten has only to look %0a%3c at this shrub, and the flow of corrupt matter from the wound %0a%3c will be staunched immediately. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 58 . -THE RADICULA OR STRUTHION : THIRTEEN REMEDIES. %0a%3c %0a%3c THE APOCYNUM : TWO OBSERVATIONS UPON IT. %0a%3c %0a%3c The radicula, which we have already 38 mentioned as being %0a%3c called “struthion” by the Greeks, is used by dyers for pre¬ %0a%3c paring wool. A decoction of it, taken internally, is curative %0a%3c of jaundice and diseases of the chest. It is diuretic also, and %0a%3c laxative, and acts as a detergent upon the uterus, for which %0a%3c reasons medical men have given it the name of the “ golden %0a%3c %0a%3c opinion that the “sandix” of B. xxxv. c. 12, is our madder, and identical %0a%3c with the Rubia. It is not improbable, however, that in reality it was a %0a%3c mineral. See Beckmann’s Hist. Inv. Yol. II. p. 110, Bohn’s Ed. %0a%3c %0a%3c 35 Fee says that it does not possess this property. %0a%3c %0a%3c 36 Madder has no colouring matter which can produce any effect upon %0a%3c the hair. %0a%3c %0a%3c 37 Or “ anti-frantic ” plant. C.

Applied with polenta and vinegar to the purls %0a%3c affected, it removes leprous sores. Used with panax and root %0a%3c of the caper-plant, it breaks and expels calculi, and a decoction %0a%3c of it in wine with barley-meal disperses inflamed tumours. It %0a%3c is used as an ingredient in emollient plasters and eye-salves %0a%3c for the sight, and is found to be one of the most useftil sternu- %0a%3c tories known ; it is good too for the liver and the spleen. Taken %0a%3c in hydrornel, in doses of one denarius, it effects the cure of %0a%3c asthma, as also of pleurisy and all pains iu the sides. %0a%3c %0a%3c The apocynum 40 is a shrub with leaves like those of ivy, but %0a%3c softer, and not so long in the stalk, and the seed of it is %0a%3c pointed and downy, with a division running down it, and a %0a%3c very powerful smell. Given in their food with water, the seed %0a%3c is poisonous 41 to dogs and all other quadrupeds. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 59 .- EOSEMAHY : EIGHTEEN KEMEDIES. %0a%3c %0a%3c There are two kinds of rosemary ; one of which is barren, %0a%3c and the other has a stem with a resinous seed, known as %0a%3c “ cachrys.” The leaves have the odour of frankincense . 43 %0a%3c The root, applied fresh, effects the cure of wounds, prolapsus %0a%3c of the rectum, condylomata, and piles. The juice of the %0a%3c plant, as well as of the root, is curative of jaundice, and such %0a%3c diseases as require detergents ; it is useful also for the sight. %0a%3c The seed is given in drink for inveterate diseases of the chest, %0a%3c and, with wine and pepper, for affections of the uterus; it %0a%3c acts also as an emmenagogue, and is used with meal of darnel %0a%3c as a liniment for gout. It acts also as a detergent upon %0a%3c freckles, and is used as an application in diseases which %0a%3c require calorifics or sudorifics, and for convulsions. The plant %0a%3c itself, or else the root, taken in wine, increases the milk, and %0a%3c the leaves and stem of the plant are applied with vinegar %0a%3c to scrofulous sores; used with honey, they are very useful for %0a%3c cough. %0a%3c %0a%3c 33 “ Aureum poculum.” %0a%3c %0a%3c 40 Desfontaines says that it is the Periploca angustifolia; Fee gives the %0a%3c Apocynum folio subrotundo of C. Bauhin, round leafed do°-sbane. %0a%3c %0a%3c 11 This is the fact; and hence one of its names “ cynanche,” or “ dog- %0a%3c strangle.” %0a%3c %0a%3c this, Fee says, is the fact. The plant is rich in essential oil, and is %0a%3c consequently a powerful excitant.

It neu¬ %0a%3c tralizes poisons and the venom of animals, that of serpents %0a%3c excepted. It acts also as a sudorific, dispels griping pains in %0a%3c the bowels, and increases the milk in nursing women. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 61 . -THE HERB SAVIN : SEVEN REMEDIES. %0a%3c %0a%3c Of the herb savin, known as “ brathy” by the Greeks , 46 there %0a%3c are two varieties, one of them 48 with a leaf like that of the %0a%3c tamarix, the other 47 with that of the cypress ; for which reason %0a%3c some persons have called this last the Cretan cypress. It is %0a%3c used by many for fumigations, as a substitute for frankin¬ %0a%3c cense ; 48 employed in medicine, it is said to have the same effect %0a%3c as cinnamon, if taken in doses twice as large. It reduces %0a%3c gatherings, disperses corrosive sores, acts as a detergent upon %0a%3c ulcers, and, used as a pessary and as a fumigation, brings away %0a%3c the dead foetus . 49 It is employed as a topical application for %0a%3c erysipelas and carbuncles, and, taken with honey in wine, is %0a%3c curative of jaundice. %0a%3c %0a%3c The smoke of this plant, they say, cures the pip in all kinds %0a%3c of poultry . 60 %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 62 . -SELAGO : TWO REMEDIES. %0a%3c %0a%3c Similar to savin is the herb known as “ selago .” 61 Care is %0a%3c %0a%3c 43 In B. xvi. c. 11. %0a%3c %0a%3c 44 A gall or fungoid production, or, in some instances, a catkin. Fee %0a%3c says that Pliny has committed an error here in attributing a cachrys to %0a%3c rosemary, the Libauotis stephanomaticos, which, in reality, belongs to %0a%3c the Libanotis canchryphorus or Libanotis prima. %0a%3c %0a%3c 45 So called from the Greek fipaSv, “ slow,” according to some au¬ %0a%3c thorities; by reason of the slowness of its growth. %0a%3c %0a%3c 46 Identified by Fee with the Sabina vulgatior of Lobelius, or Juniperus %0a%3c Sabina, variety /3, of Lamarck. %0a%3c %0a%3c 47 The Sabina baceifera of J. Bauhin, the male savin, the type of the %0a%3c plant. %0a%3c %0a%3c 48 See Ovid’s Fasti, B. i. 1. 341, as to this custom, and Virgil’s “ Culex,” %0a%3c 1. 403. %0a%3c %0a%3c 49 It is still a common notion, though Fee says an ill-founded one, that %0a%3c it produces abortion. Indeed we find Galen stating to the same effect. %0a%3c %0a%3c 30 Fee ridicules this notion with considerable zest. %0a%3c %0a%3c 41 Tho Lycopodium sclago of Linnaeus, upright club-moss, or fir- moss, %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 42 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c flint's natural history. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XXIV. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c taken to gather it without the use of iron, the right hand %0a%3c being passed for the purpose through the left sleeve of the %0a%3c tunic, as though the gatherer were in the act of committing a %0a%3c theft . 52 The clothing too must be white, the feet bare and %0a%3c washed clean, and a sacrifice of bread and wine must be made %0a%3c before gathering it: it is carried also in a new napkin. The %0a%3c Druids of Gaul have pretended that this plant should be %0a%3c carried about the person as a preservative against accidents of %0a%3c all kinds, and that the smoke of it is extremely good for all %0a%3c maladies of the eyes. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 63 .- SAMOLUS : TWO REMEDIES. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Druids, also, have given the name of “ samolus ’ to a %0a%3c certain plant which grows in humid localities. This too, they %0a%3c say, must be gathered fasting with the left hand, as a pre¬ %0a%3c servative against the maladies to which swine and cattle are %0a%3c soibject. The person, too, who gathers it must be careful not %0a%3c to look behind him, nor must it be laid anywhere but in the %0a%3c troughs from which the cattle drink. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 64.—GUM : ELEVEN REMEDIES. %0a%3c %0a%3c We have already 51 spoken of the different kinds of gum; %0a%3c the better sort of each kind will be found the most effective. %0a%3c Gum is bad for the teeth; it tends to make the blood coagu¬ %0a%3c late, and is consequently good for discharges 55 of blood from %0a%3c the mouth. It is useful for burns , 56 but is bad for diseases of %0a%3c the trachea. It exercises a diuretic effect, and tends to %0a%3c neutralize all acridities, being astringent in other respects. %0a%3c The gum of the bitter-almond tree, which, has the most 57 %0a%3c %0a%3c according to Sprengel. Fee, however, dissents from that opinion, for the %0a%3c Lycopodium, he says, is but some three inches in height, while savin, with %0a%3c which the Selago is here compared, is more than eight or ten feet high.

The seed of all these trees resembles* 4 the lentil %0a%3c in appearance, only that it is smaller, as well as the pod which %0a%3c contains it: it is gathered in autumn, before which period it %0a%3c would be too powerful in its effects. The juice is left to %0a%3c thicken in the pods, which are steeped in rain-water for the %0a%3c purpose, and then pounded in a mortar; after which, the %0a%3c juice is extracted by means of presses. It is then dried in the %0a%3c mortars in the sun, and when dry is divided into tablets. A %0a%3c similar juice is extracted from the leaves, but it is by no %0a%3c means 64 so useful as the other. The seed is used also, as a %0a%3c substitute for nut-galls in curing leather. 66 %0a%3c %0a%3c The juice extracted from the leaves, as also the extremely %0a%3c black juice of the Galatian 67 acacia, is held in no esteem.

When required %0a%3c for these purposes, the tablets are steeped in water by some, %0a%3c while some again scorch them, and others reduce them to %0a%3c ashes. They are useful for dyeing the hair, and for the cure of %0a%3c erysipelas, serpiginous sores, ulcerations of the humid parts of %0a%3c the body, gatherings, contusions of the joints, chilblains, and %0a%3c hangnails. They are good also for cases of excessive menstru¬ %0a%3c ation, procidence of the uterus and rectum, affections of the %0a%3c eyes, and ulcerations of the generative organs 68 and mouth, %0a%3c naeus, the white hawthorn, or May.

The best kind is that which is the %0a%3c least 73 ferulaceous in the stem, and which is of a red colour, or %0a%3c inclining to purple, when the bark is removed. It is found %0a%3c growing in many places, but is not everywhere odoriferous. %0a%3c We have already 74 stated how remarkably sweet the odour of %0a%3c it is, when the rainbow has been extended over it. %0a%3c %0a%3c This plant cures fetid ulcers of the mouth, polypus 78 of the %0a%3c nose, ulcerations or carbuncles of the generative organs, and %0a%3c chaps ; taken in drink it acts as a carminative, and is curative %0a%3c of strangury. The bark is good for patients troubled with %0a%3c discharges of blood, and a decoction of it acts astringently on %0a%3c the bowels. It is generally thought that the wild plant is %0a%3c productive of the same effects. %0a%3c %0a%3c 69 Fbe suggests that this may be the Dipsacus fullonum of Linnaeus, %0a%3c the fuller’s thistle. %0a%3c %0a%3c %3c u See B. xix. c. 18, and c. 58 of this Book. %0a%3c %0a%3c 11 In B. xii. c. 52. But in that passage he makes the Aspalathos to be %0a%3c identical with the Erysisceptrum, which he here distinguishes from it. Fee %0a%3c thinks that there can be no identity between the common thorn here men¬ %0a%3c tioned, and the Aspalathos. This latter, as mentioned in B. xii., according %0a%3c to Fee, is the Convolvulus scoparius of Linnaeus, the broom bindweed, but %0a%3c Littre says that M. Fraas has identified it with the Genista acanthoclada. %0a%3c %0a%3c 73 See the preceding Note.

These berries are of a desiccative, astringent, %0a%3c nature, 81 and are extremely useful for maladies of the gums, %0a%3c tonsillary glands, and generative organs. They neutralize also %0a%3c the venom of those most deadly of serpents, the haemorrhois 83 %0a%3c and the prester ; 89 and the flowers or fruit will heal wounds %0a%3c inflicted by scorpions, without any danger of abscesses forming. %0a%3c The shoots of the bramble have a diuretic effect: and the %0a%3c more tender ones are pounded, and the juice extracted and then %0a%3c dried in the sun till it has attained the consistency of honey, %0a%3c being considered a most excellent remedy, taken in drink or %0a%3c applied externally, for maladies of the mouth and eyes, dis¬ %0a%3c charges of blood from the mouth, quinzy, affections of the %0a%3c %0a%3c It is not improbable that Pliny, in copying from some other author, has %0a%3c mistaken the one for the other. %0a%3c %0a%3c 81 An exaggeration, no doubt.

Although supposed %0a%3c by”many to have been the invention of the natives of Australasia, repre¬ %0a%3c sentations of it are found on the sculptures of Nineveh.

The other %0a%3c kind, 12 which is found growing wild, is of a more swarthy hue, %0a%3c in some measure inclining to red ; it bears too a sort 13 of pod. %0a%3c With the root of it boiled in water a medicament is made, %0a%3c known as “lycium:” 14 the seed of it is useful for bringing %0a%3c away the after-birth. The white kind, however, is of a more %0a%3c astringent and cooling nature, and better adapted for the treat¬ %0a%3c ment of gatherings and wounds. The leaves of both kinds, %0a%3c either raw or boiled, are employed topically with oil. %0a%3c %0a%3c 6 The raspberry; see B. xvi. c. 71. %0a%3c %0a%3c 7 There is one variety which is very diminutive, and entirely destitute %0a%3c %0a%3c of thorns, the Rubus Idseus lsevis of C. Bauhin, the Rubus Idaeus non %0a%3c spinosus of J. Bauhin. 8 See B. xvi. c. 71. %0a%3c %0a%3c 9 Of the bramble genus. %0a%3c %0a%3c 10 In reality, as Fee says, there is no botanical affinity between the %0a%3c Rubus, or bramble, and the Rhamnus. %0a%3c %0a%3c 11 Sprengel identifies this plant with the Zizyphus vulgaris of Linnaeus, %0a%3c the jujube, and Desfontaines is of the same opinion. Fee, however, takes %0a%3c it to be the Rhamnus saxatilis of Linnaeus, the rock buckthorn. %0a%3c %0a%3c 12 Identified by some authorities with the Paliurus aculeatus of Decan- %0a%3c dolles, mentioned in c. 71. Sprengel is in doubt whether it may not be %0a%3c the Rhamnus lycioides of Linnaeus. %0a%3c %0a%3c 13 Not a characteristic, Fee says, of the genus Rhamnus of modern Botany %0a%3c %0a%3c 11 Or “Lycian” extract.

The branches and roots, which are intensely %0a%3c bitter, 17 are first pounded and then boiled for three days in %0a%3c a copper vessel, after which the woody parts are removed, %0a%3c and the decoction is boiled again, till it has attained the %0a%3c consistency of honey. It is adulterated with various bitter %0a%3c extracts, 18 as also with amurca of olive oil and ox-gall. The %0a%3c froth or flower 19 of this decoction is used as an ingredient in %0a%3c compositions for the eyes : and the other part of it is employed %0a%3c as a cosmetic for the face, and for the cure of itch-scabs, %0a%3c corroding sores in the corners of the eyes, inveterate fluxes, %0a%3c and suppurations of the ears. It is useful too for diseases of %0a%3c the tonsillary glands and gums, for coughs, and for discharges %0a%3c of blood from the mouth, being generally taken in pieces the %0a%3c size of a bean. For the cure of discharges from wounds, it %0a%3c is applied to the part affected; and it is similarly used for %0a%3c chaps, ulcerations of the genitals, excoriations, ulcers, whether %0a%3c putrid, serpiginous, or of recent date, hard excrescences 20 of %0a%3c the nostrils, and suppurations. It is taken also by females, %0a%3c in milk, for the purpose of arresting the catamenia when in %0a%3c excess. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Indian lycium is distinguished from the other kinds %0a%3c by its colour, the lumps being black outside, and, when broken, %0a%3c red within, though they turn black very quickly. 21 It is %0a%3c bitter and remarkably astringent, and is employed for all the %0a%3c purposes above mentioned, diseases of the generative organs in %0a%3c particular. %0a%3c %0a%3c 15 See B. xii. c. 15. Fee identifies this with the modern Catechu, a de¬ %0a%3c coction from the Acacia catechu, a leguminous plant of the East Indies. %0a%3c %0a%3c 16 The Rhamnus lycioides of Linnaeus, our buckthorn. The Indian %0a%3c plant from which catechu is extracted is of a similar nature.

According to some, the leaves are %0a%3c serrated, and it was these, they say, that first suggested the %0a%3c idea of the saw : 2S the flower of it borders closely upon purple. %0a%3c This plant is gathered in rough craggy localities, when it is %0a%3c replete with juice; and, whether taken 29 internally or applied %0a%3c topically, it is extremely efficacious for the stings of venomous %0a%3c Berpents, diseases of the stomach, inveterate coughs, collections %0a%3c of phlegm in the throat, ruptures, convulsions, and pains %0a%3c in the sides. It diminishes the volume of the spleen, and acts %0a%3c as a diuretic and emmenagogue; for which reasons it is very %0a%3c useful in incipient dropsy, the usual dose being a handful of %0a%3c the sprigs boiled down to one third in three heminae of water. %0a%3c Lozenges too are made of it for the above-named purposes, by %0a%3c bruising it in water. In combination with honey, it heals %0a%3c abscesses and inveterate or sordid ulcers : a wine 30 too is pre¬ %0a%3c pared from it for diseases of the chest.

The chamaecyparissos 43 is a herb which, taken in %0a%3c wine, counteracts the venom of serpents of all kinds, and of %0a%3c scorpions. %0a%3c %0a%3c The ampeloprason 44 is found growing in vineyards; it has %0a%3c leaves like those of the leek, and produces offensive eructa¬ %0a%3c tions. It is highly efficacious for the stings of serpents, and %0a%3c acts as an emmenagogue and diuretic. Taken in drink or %0a%3c applied externally, it arrests discharges of blood from the gene¬ %0a%3c rative organs.

This plant is taken in %0a%3c drink, for convulsions, ruptures, strangury, and wounds inflicted %0a%3c by serpents: a decoction is also made of it, and the juice is %0a%3c similarly employed. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 88.-THE CLEMATIS CENTUNCULUS ; THREE REMEDIES. %0a%3c %0a%3c We shall now have to annex some plants, of a marvellous %0a%3c nature no doubt, but not so well known, reserving those of a %0a%3c higher reputation for the succeeding Hooks. %0a%3c %0a%3c Our people give the name of “ centunculus,” 48 to a creep¬ %0a%3c ing plant that grows in the fields, the leaves of which bear a %0a%3c strong resemblance to the hoods attached to our cloaks. By %0a%3c the Greeks it is known as the “ clematis.” Taken in astrin¬ %0a%3c gent wine it is wonderfully effectual for arresting 41 * diarrhoea: %0a%3c beaten up, in doses of one denarius, in five cyathi of oxymel %0a%3c or of warm water, it arrests haemorrhage, and facilitates the %0a%3c after-birth. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 89 . -THE CLEMATIS ECHITES, OR LAflINE. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Greeks have other varieties also of the clematis, one of %0a%3c which is known as “ echites” 50 or “lagine,” and by some as %0a%3c the “ little scammony.” Its stems are about two feet in height, %0a%3c and covered with leaves: in general appearance it is not %0a%3c unlike scammony, were it not that the leaves are darker and %0a%3c more diminutive; it is found growing in vineyards and cultivated %0a%3c soils. It is eaten as a vegetable, with oil and salt, and acts as %0a%3c a laxative upon the bowels. It is taken 51 also for dysentery, %0a%3c %0a%3c basil. It has some useful properties attributed to it; but what Pliny here %0a%3c states respecting it is erroneous. %0a%3c %0a%3c 47 This seems to be the meaning of “orbiculato foliorum ambitu." %0a%3c %0a%3c *i Turner and C. Bauhin identify it with the Gnaphalium Germanicura %0a%3c of Lamarck, and Sprengel with the Polygonum convolvulus of Linnaeus. %0a%3c If so, I ee says, the synonym here given by Pliny is erroneous; for the %0a%3c Greek clematis, there can be little doubt, is the Clematis cirrhosa of Lin¬ %0a%3c naeus.

Respecting this plant %0a%3c and the dracontium, there have been considerable differences %0a%3c of opinion. Some writers, indeed, have maintained that they %0a%3c are identical, and Glaucias has made the only distinction %0a%3c between them in reference to the place of their growth, %0a%3c assuming that the dracontium is nothing else than the aron in %0a%3c a wild state. Some persons, again, have called the root “ aron,” %0a%3c and the stem of the plant “ dracontium but if the dracon¬ %0a%3c tium is the same as the one known to us as the “ dracuncu- %0a%3c lus,” 85 it is a different plant altogether; for while the aron has %0a%3c a broad, black, rounded root, and considerably larger,—large %0a%3c enough, indeed, to fill the hand,—the dracunculus has a %0a%3c %0a%3c 52 The Vinca major and Vinca minor of Linnaeus, the greater and smaller %0a%3c periwinkle.

As an article of food, %0a%3c however, they give the preference to the female plant, the %0a%3c male plant being of a harder nature, and more difficult to cook. %0a%3c It carries off, 69 they say, all vicious humours from the chest, %0a%3c and powdered and taken in the form either of a potion or of %0a%3c an electuary, it acts as a diuretic and emmenagogue. Powdered %0a%3c and taken in oxymel, it is good for the stomach; and we find %0a%3c it stated that it is administered in ewe’s milk for ulcerations %0a%3c of the intestines, and is sometimes cooked on hot ashes and %0a%3c given in oil for a cough. Some persons, again, are in the habit %0a%3c of boiling it in milk and administering the decoction ; and it %0a%3c has been used also in a boiled state as a topical application for %0a%3c defluxions of the eyes, contusions, and affections of the tonsil¬ %0a%3c lary glands. * * * * 60 prescribes it with oil, as an %0a%3c %0a%3c injection for piles, and recommends it as a liniment, with %0a%3c honey, for freckles. %0a%3c %0a%3c Cleophantus has greatly extolled this plant as an antidote for %0a%3c poisons, and for the treatment of pleurisy and peripneumony, %0a%3c prepared the same way as for coughs. The seed too, pounded %0a%3c with olive oil or oil of roses, is used as an injection for pains %0a%3c %0a%3c 56 From “ draco,” a “ dragon ” or “ serpent.” Fee says, that it is not %0a%3c to its roots, but to its spotted stem, resembling the skin of an adder, that %0a%3c it owes its name. %0a%3c %0a%3c 57 i; Vi ms .” Fee says that the Arum dracunculus has a strong, fetid %0a%3c odour, and all parts of it are acrid and caustic, while the Arum colocasia %0a%3c has an agreeable flavour when boiled. %0a%3c %0a%3c 69 This, Fee says, is fabulous. %0a%3c %0a%3c 59 Though no longer used in medicine, the account here given of the %0a%3c properties of the Arum colocasia is in general correct, a few marvellous %0a%3c details excepted. %0a%3c %0a%3c 60 Sillig thinks that there is a lacuna here, and that the name “ Cleo¬ %0a%3c phantus ” should be supplied. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Cbap. 92.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c THE AEON". %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 59 %0a%3c %0a%3c in the ears. Dieuches prescribes it, mixed in bread 61 with meal, %0a%3c for the cure of coughs, asthma, hardness of breathing, and %0a%3c purulent expectorations. Diodotus recommends it, in combi¬ %0a%3c nation with honey, as an electuary for phthisis and diseases of %0a%3c the lungs, and as a topical application even for fractured bones. %0a%3c Applied to the sexual parts, it facilitates delivery in all kinds %0a%3c of animals; and the juice extracted from the root, in combina¬ %0a%3c tion with Attic honey, disperses films upon the eyes, and %0a%3c diseases of the stomach. A decoction of it with honey is %0a%3c curative of cough ; and the juice is a marvellous remedy for %0a%3c ulcers of every description, whether phagedsenic, carcinomatous, %0a%3c or serpiginous, and for polypus of the nostrils. The leaves, %0a%3c boiled in wine and oil, are good for burns, and, taken with %0a%3c salt and vinegar, are strongly purgative; boiled with honey, %0a%3c they are useful also for sprains, and used either fresh or %0a%3c dried, with salt, for gout in the joints. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hippocrates has prescribed the leaves, either fresh or %0a%3c dried, with honey, as a topical application for abscesses. Two %0a%3c drachmae of the seed or root, in two cyathi of wine, are a %0a%3c sufficient dose to act as an emmenagogue, and a similar quan¬ %0a%3c tity will have the effect of bringing away the after-birth, in %0a%3c cases where it is retarded. 62 Hippocrates used to apply the root %0a%3c also, for the purpose. They say too, that in times of pestilence %0a%3c the employment of aron as an article of food is very beneficial. %0a%3c It dispels the fumes of wine ; and the smoke of it burnt drives %0a%3c away serpents, 63 the asp in particular, or else stupefies them to %0a%3c 6uch a degree as to reduce them to a state of torpor. These %0a%3c reptiles also will fly at the approach of persons whose bodies %0a%3c have been rubbed with a preparation of aron with oil of %0a%3c laurel: hence it is generally thought a good plan to administer %0a%3c it in red wine to persons who have been stung by serpents. %0a%3c Cheese, it is said, keeps remarkably well, wrapped in leaves %0a%3c of thiB plant. %0a%3c %0a%3c 61 F6e thinks that, thus employed, it would be more injurious than %0a%3c beneficial. Though Pliny is treating here of the Arum colocasia or %0a%3c Egyptian Arum, he has mingled some few details with it, relative to the %0a%3c Arum dracunculus, a plant endowed with much more energetic properties. %0a%3c See Note 57 above. %0a%3c %0a%3c 62 See B. viii. c. 54, as to the use alleged to be made by animals of this %0a%3c plant. %0a%3c %0a%3c 63 Fee says that this is very doubtful. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 60 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c pltnt’s natural htstort. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XXIV. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 93 . -THE DRACTJNCUL0S ; TWO REMEDIES. %0a%3c %0a%3c The plant whioh I have spoken of 65 as the dracunculus, is %0a%3c taken out of the ground just when the barley is ripening, and %0a%3c at the moon’s increase. It is quite sufficient to ha^e this %0a%3c plant about one, to be safe from all serpents; and it is said, %0a%3c that an infusion of the larger kind taken in drink, is very useful %0a%3c for persons who have been stung by those reptiles : it is stated %0a%3c also that it arrests the catamenia when in excess, due care being %0a%3c taken not to let iron touch it. The juice of it too is very use¬ %0a%3c ful for pains in the ears. %0a%3c %0a%3c As to the plant known to the Greeks by the name of “ dra- %0a%3c contion,” I have 66 had it pointed out to me under three dif¬ %0a%3c ferent forms ; the first 67 having the leaves of the beet, with a %0a%3c certain proportion of stem, and a purple flower, and bearing %0a%3c a strong resemblance to the aron. Other persons, again, have %0a%3c described it as a plant 69 with a long root, embossed to all ap¬ %0a%3c pearance and full of knots, and consisting of three stems in all; %0a%3c the same parties have recommended a decoction of the leaves %0a%3c in vinegar, as curative of stings inflicted by serpents. The %0a%3c third 70 plant that has been pointed out to me has a leaf larger %0a%3c than that of the cornel, and a root resembling that of the reed. %0a%3c This root, I have been assured, has as many knots on it as the %0a%3c plant is years old, the leaves, too, being as many in number. %0a%3c The plant is recommended also for the stings of serpents, %0a%3c administered either in wine or in water. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 94.-THE ARISAKOS : THREE REMEDIES. %0a%3c %0a%3c There is a plant also called the “ arisaros,” 71 which grows %0a%3c in Egypt, and is similar to the aron in appearance, only that %0a%3c it is more diminutive, and has smaller leaves; the root too is %0a%3c smaller, though fully as large as a good-sized olive. The %0a%3c white arisaros throws out two stems, the other kind only one. %0a%3c They are curative, both of them, of running ulcers and burns, %0a%3c and are used as an injection for fistulas.

It grows in marshy lo¬ %0a%3c calities, and is remarkably useful for the treatment of wounds. %0a%3c It is taken in vinegar for strangury, affections of the bladder, %0a%3c asthma, and falls with violence ; it is extremely efficacious also %0a%3c for tooth-ache. %0a%3c %0a%3c In Etruria, the same name is given to a small meadow- %0a%3c plant , 73 provided with leaves at the sides, like hairs, and par¬ %0a%3c ticularly useful for wounds.

(17.)- CORACESTA AND CALLICIA. %0a%3c %0a%3c While I am treating of plants of a marvellous nature, I am %0a%3c induced to make some mention of certain magical plants—for %0a%3c what, in fact, can there be more marvellous than they ? The first %0a%3c who descanted upon this subject in our part of the world were %0a%3c Pythagoras and Democritus, who have adopted the accounts %0a%3c given by the Magi. Coracesta 79 and callicia, according to %0a%3c Pythagoras, are plants which congeal 30 water. I find no %0a%3c mention made of them, however, by any other author, and he %0a%3c himself gives no further particulars relative to them. %0a%3c %0a%3c douin says that it is musk chervil, the Chajrophyllum aromaticum of Lin¬ %0a%3c naeus, in which he has followed Dodonaeus. Fuchsius suggests the Chsero- %0a%3c phyllum silvestre of Linnaeus: Fee expresses himself at a loss to decide. %0a%3c %0a%3c 77 Probably the Iledysarum onobrychis of Linnaeus, our sainfoin. %0a%3c %0a%3c 78 They are very much larger than those of the lentil, in fact. This %0a%3c diversity has caused Fee to express some doubts whether it really is iden¬ %0a%3c tical with sainfoin. The Polygala officinalis has also been suggested. %0a%3c %0a%3c 79 Dalechauips considers these appellations to mean the “ vir%3cnns’ plant,” %0a%3c and the “plant of beauty.” %0a%3c %0a%3c 80 The Cissampelos Pareira, as already stated, abounds in mucilage to %0a%3c such a degree, as to impart a consistency to water, without impairing its %0a%3c transparency.

He adds too, that if this decoction is poured %0a%3c upon the grass, and a person happens to tread upon it, or if %0a%3c the body should chance to be sprinkled with it, the result is %0a%3c fatal beyond all remedy; so monstrously malignant are the %0a%3c venomous proporties of this plant, except as neutralizing %0a%3c other kinds of poison. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP 101. -THE APROXIS: SIX REMEDIES. %0a%3c %0a%3c Pythagoras makes mention, too, of a plant called aproxis, %0a%3c the root of which takes fire 82 at a distance, like naphtha, of %0a%3c which we have made some mention, when speaking 83 of the mar¬ %0a%3c vellous productions of the earth. He says too, that if the %0a%3c human body happens to be attacked by any disease while the %0a%3c cabbage 81 is in blossom, the person, although he may have %0a%3c been perfectly cured, will be sensible of a recurrence of the %0a%3c symptoms, every time that plant comes into blossom; a %0a%3c peculiarity which he attributes to it in common with wheat, %0a%3c hemlock, and the violet. %0a%3c %0a%3c I am not ignorant, however, that the work of his from %0a%3c which I have just quoted is ascribed to the physician Cleem- %0a%3c poru3 by some, though antiquity and the unbroken current of %0a%3c tradition concur in claiming it for Pythagoras. It is quite %0a%3c enough, however, to say in favour of a book, that the author %0a%3c has deemed the results of his labours worthy to be published %0a%3c under the name of so great a man. And yet who can believe %0a%3c that Cleemporus would do this, seeing that he has not %0a%3c hesitated to publish other works under his own name ? %0a%3c %0a%3c 81 The reading of this word is doubtful. Hardouin thinks that it is the %0a%3c same as the’Minyanthes mentioned in B. xxi. c. 88. %0a%3c %0a%3c 82 Fee says that the only cases known of a phsenomenon resembling %0a%3c this, are those of the Dictamnus albus, white dittany, which attracts flame %0a%3c momentarily when in flower, and of the Tropceolum majus, or great Indian %0a%3c cress. He thinks, however, that there are some trees so rich in essential %0a%3c oil, that they might possibly ignite as readily as naphtha. %0a%3c %0a%3c 83 In B. ii. c. 109. %0a%3c %0a%3c 61 Another reading here is “ aproxis,” which seems more probable. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 64 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c PLINY’S NATURAL HISTORY. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XXIV. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 102.-THE AGLAOPHOTIS OR MARMARITIS.

How very much more %0a%3c marvellous too are the accounts given in this book by the %0a%3c philosopher who, next to Pythagoras, has acquired the most in¬ %0a%3c timate knowledge of the learning of the Magi! According %0a%3c to him, the plant aglaophotis, 86 which owes its name to the %0a%3c admiration in which its beauteous tints are held by man, is %0a%3c found growing among the marble quarries of Arabia, on the %0a%3c side of Persia, a circumstance which has given it the additional %0a%3c name of “ marmaritis.” By means of this plant, he says, the %0a%3c Magi can summon the deities into their presence when they %0a%3c please. %0a%3c %0a%3c The achaemenis, 87 he says, a plant the colour of amber, %0a%3c and destitute of leaves, grows in the country of theTradastili, an %0a%3c Indian race. The root of it, divided into lozenges and taken %0a%3c in wine in the day time, torments the guilty to such a degree %0a%3c during the night by the various forms of avenging deities pre¬ %0a%3c sented to the imagination, as to extort from them a confession %0a%3c of their crimes. He gives it the name also of “ hippophobas,” %0a%3c it being an especial object of terror to mares. %0a%3c %0a%3c The theobrotion 88 is a plant found at a distance of thirty %0a%3c schosni 89 from the river Choaspes; it represents the varied tints %0a%3c of the peacock, and the odour of it is remarkably fine.

Desfontaines queries whether it may not be %0a%3c the Caesalpinia pulcherrima, a native of the East. Some authors, Fee %0a%3c says, have identified it with the “ Moly ” of Homer. %0a%3c %0a%3c B7 So called from Achaemenes, the ancestor of the Persian kings. Fe'e %0a%3c thinks that it was a variety of the Euphorbia antiquorum, or else a night¬ %0a%3c shade. 88 “ Pood for the gods.” %0a%3c %0a%3c 89 See B. xii. c. 30; also the Introduction to Vol. III. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 102.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c THE TIIEAXGELIS. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 65 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c kings of Persia, he says, are in the habit of taking it in their %0a%3c food or drink, for all maladies of the body, and derangements of %0a%3c the mind. It has the additional name of semnion, 90 from the %0a%3c use thus made of it by majesty. %0a%3c %0a%3c He next tells us of the adamantis, 91 a plant grown in %0a%3c Armenia and Cappadocia: presented to a lion, he says, the beast %0a%3c will fall upon its back, and drop its jaws. Its name originates %0a%3c in the fact that it is impossible to bruise it. The arianis, 92 %0a%3c he say8, is found in the country of the Ariani; it is of a fiery %0a%3c colour, and is gathered when the sun is in Leo. Wood rubbed %0a%3c with oil will take fire on coming in contact with this plant. The %0a%3c therionarca, 93 he tells us, grows in Cappadocia and Mysia; it %0a%3c has the effect of striking wild beasts of all kinds with a torpor %0a%3c which can only be dispelled by sprinkling them with the urine %0a%3c of the hyaena. He speaks too of the aethiopis, 91 a plant wfiich %0a%3c grows in Meroe; for which reason it is also known as the %0a%3c “mero'is.” In leaf it resembles the lettuce, and, taken with %0a%3c honied wine, it is very good for dropsy. The ophiusa, 95 which %0a%3c is found in Elephantine, an island also of ^Ethiopia, is a %0a%3c plant of a livid colour, and hideous to the sight. Taken by a %0a%3c person in drink, he says, it inspires such a horror of serpents, %0a%3c wdiich his imagination continually represents as menacing him, %0a%3c that he commits suicide at last; hence it is that persons guilty %0a%3c of sacrilege are compelled to drink an infusion of it.

Taken internally with myrrh and %0a%3c wine, all sorts of visionary forms present themselves, and %0a%3c excite the most immoderate laughter, which can only be put %0a%3c an end to by taking kernels of the pine-nut, with pepper and %0a%3c honey, in palm wine. %0a%3c %0a%3c The hestiatoris, 2 he tells us, is a Persian plant, so called from %0a%3c its promotion of gaiety and good fellowship at carousals. %0a%3c Another name for it is protomedia, because those who eat of it %0a%3c will gain the highest place in the royal favour. The casignetes 1 %0a%3c too, we learn, is so called, because it grows only among plants %0a%3c of its own kind, and is never found in company with any %0a%3c other; another name given to it is “ dionysonymphas,” 4 from %0a%3c the circumstance of its being remarkably well adapted to the %0a%3c nature of wine. Helianthes® is the name he gives to a plant %0a%3c found in the regions of Themiscyra and the mountainous parts %0a%3c of maritime Cilicia, with leaves like those of myrtle. This %0a%3c plant i3 boiled up with lion’s fat, saffron and palm wine being %0a%3c added; the Magi, he tells us, and Persian monarchs are in %0a%3c the habit of anointing the body with the preparation, to add %0a%3c to its graceful appearance : he states also, that for this reason %0a%3c it has the additional name of “ heliocallis.” 6 What the same %0a%3c author calls “ hermesias,” 7 has the singular virtue of ensuring %0a%3c the procreation of issue, both beautiful as well as good. It is %0a%3c not a plant, however, but a composition made of kernels of %0a%3c pine nuts, pounded with honey, myrrh, saffron, and palm wine, %0a%3c to which theobrotium 9 and milk are then added.

In addition to what has %0a%3c here been stated, Democritus gives the various names by which %0a%3c all these plants are known to the Magi. %0a%3c %0a%3c Apollodorus, one of the followers of Democritus, has added %0a%3c to this list the herb aeschynomene, 10 so called from the shrink¬ %0a%3c ing of its leaves at the approach of the hand; and another %0a%3c called “ crocis,” 11 the touch of Avhich is fatal to the phalan- %0a%3c gium. Crateuas, also, speaks of the oenotheris, 12 an infusion of %0a%3c which in wine, sprinkled upon them, has the effect of taming %0a%3c all kind of animals, however wild. A celebrated grammarian, 13 %0a%3c who lived but very recently, has described the anacampseros, 14 %0a%3c the very touch of which recalls former love, even though %0a%3c hatred should have succeeded in its place.

This %0a%3c %0a%3c 9 As Fee remarks, it has been a notion in comparatively recent times, %0a%3c that it is possible to procreate children of either sex at pleasure. %0a%3c %0a%3c 10 The “bashful” plant. An Acacia, Fee thinks; see B. xiii. c. 19. %0a%3c The Mimosa casta, pudica, and sensitive, have similar properties: the Sensi¬ %0a%3c tive Plant is well known in this country. %0a%3c %0a%3c 11 Fee queries whether this may not be the Silene muscipula of Lin¬ %0a%3c naeus, the nv-trap. 12 The “wine-tamer.” %0a%3c %0a%3c 13 Hardouin thinks that he alludes to the Grammarian Apion. Dale- %0a%3c clmmps thinks that it is either Apion or Apollodorus. %0a%3c %0a%3c 14 The “returning” plant. Fee says that the Sedum Telephium of %0a%3c Linnaeus, or orpine, is called in the dictionaries by this name. He queries %0a%3c whether it may not be the Sedum anacampseros, or evergreen orpine, as %0a%3c Hesychius says that it continues to live after being taken up from the %0a%3c earth ; a peculiarity, to some extent, of the house-leek. %0a%3c %0a%3c 15 He probably alludes to his remarks upon Magic,in Books xxix. and xxx. %0a%3c %0a%3c ,fi From tpi^op, a “kid.” Ruellius has attempted to identify this plant %0a%3c %0a%3c with one of the itanunculaccm ; but there is little doubt, as Fee says, that %0a%3c both plant and insect are imaginary. %0a%3c %0a%3c F 2 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 63 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c pliny’s natural history. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XXIY. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c beetle is continually ascending tbe interior of the stalk, and %0a%3c as often descending, while it emits a sound like the cry ol a %0a%3c kid; a circumstance to which the plant is indebted for its name. %0a%3c There is nothing in existence, they say, more beneficial to the %0a%3c voice. %0a%3c %0a%3c chap. 104. —tub wool plant: one remedy, the lactobis: %0a%3c %0a%3c ONE REMEDY.

The plant commonly called lactoris, 18 is equally well %0a%3c known: it is full of a milky juice, the taste of which produces %0a%3c vomiting. Some persons say that this is identical with, while %0a%3c others say that it only resembles, the plant known as “mili- %0a%3c taris,” 19 from the fact that, applied with oil, it will effect the %0a%3c cure, within five days, of any wound that has been inflicted %0a%3c with iron. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 105.-THE STRATIOTES: FIVE REMEDIES. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Greeks speak in high terms also of the stratiotes* %0a%3c though that is a plant which grows in Egypt only, and during %0a%3c the inundations of the river Nilus. It is similar in appearance %0a%3c to the aizoon, 21 except that the leaves are larger. It is of a %0a%3c remarkably cooling nature, and, applied with vinegar, it heals %0a%3c wounds, as well as erysipelas and suppurations.

The blossom of it is of a %0a%3c silvery hue. Beaten up with stale axle-grease, due care being %0a%3c taken not to touch it with iuon, this plant is extremely useful %0a%3c for tumours, inflammations, and gatherings; the patient, how¬ %0a%3c ever, on being anointed with it must spit three times on the %0a%3c right side.

It is clothed with leaves like a thyrsus, and is %0a%3c terminated by a head, from Avhich a number of small branches %0a%3c protrude, terminated, all of them, in a similar manner. It is %0a%3c this peculiar conformation that has procured for it the name %0a%3c of “ impia,” from the progeny thus surmounting the parent. %0a%3c Some persons, however, are of opinion that it is so called %0a%3c because no animal will touch it. Bruised between two stones %0a%3c it yields an effervescent juice, which, in combination with %0a%3c wine and milk, is remarkably efficacious for quinzy. %0a%3c %0a%3c There is a marvellous property attributed to this plant, to %0a%3c the effect that persons who have once tasted it will never he %0a%3c attacked by quinzy; for which reason it is given to swine: %0a%3c those among them, however, which refuse to take it will be sure %0a%3c to die of that disease. Some persons too are of opinion that %0a%3c if slips of it are put into a bird’s nest, they will effectually %0a%3c prevent the young birds from choking themselves by eating too %0a%3c voraciously. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 114.—THE PLANT CALLED VENUS* COMB: ONE REMEDY. %0a%3c %0a%3c From its resemblance to a comb, they give the name of %0a%3c “ Venus’ comb” 29 to a certain plant, the root of which, bruised %0a%3c %0a%3c K Fee suggests that this may possibly be tbe Spiraea ulmaria of Linnam %0a%3c %0a%3c 27 The “ impious ” or “ unnatural ” plant. Fee identifies it with the %0a%3c Filago Gallica of Linnaeus, the corn cudweed. It is destitute of medicinal %0a%3c properties, and what Pliny states is without foundation. %0a%3c %0a%3c 29 Generally identified with the Scandix pecten Veneris, corn cicely, or %0a%3c shepherd’s needle.

The %0a%3c herbaceous plant called “notia,” which is used by curriers %0a%3c for dyeing leather a bright, cheerful colour, and known by %0a%3c them under various names—is curative of cancerous ulcers; %0a%3c I find it also stated that, taken in wine or in oxycrate, it is %0a%3c extremely efficacious for stings inflicted by scorpions. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAr. 116.-THE rniLANTUROPOS : ONE REMEDY.

Taken out of the ground without the aid of iron, %0a%3c and thrown into their wash, or given to them in wine and milk, it %0a%3c cures diseases in swine. Some persons add, however, that the %0a%3c person, as he takes it up, must say—“ This is the plant arge- %0a%3c inon, a remedy discovered by Minerva for such swine as shall %0a%3c taste thereof.” %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 117.-TORDYLON OR SYltEON : THREE REMEDIES. %0a%3c %0a%3c Tordylon is, according to some authorities, the seed of sili, 36 %0a%3c while according to others it is a distinct plant, 36 known also %0a%3c as “syrcon.” I find no particulars relative to it, except that %0a%3c %0a%3c M Fee queries whether this may not possibly be the Rhus coriaria of %0a%3c Linnaeus, elm-leaved sumach, mentioned in B. xiii. c. 13. He would %0a%3c appear, however, to have confounded it with the Notia, next mentioned. %0a%3c %0a%3c 31 “ Man-loving,” or rather “ attached to man.” Identified with the %0a%3c Galium aparine of Linnaeus, goose-grass, or common ladies bedstraw; the %0a%3c seeds of which attach themselves to the dress. 33 See B. xxi. c. 64. %0a%3c %0a%3c 33 The dog-bur.

In all other %0a%3c parts of the world the leaves of it are tapering, and come to a %0a%3c point; but upon Mount Parnassus 38 they resemble the leaves of %0a%3c the ivy, the plant throwing out a greater number of stems than %0a%3c elsewhere, and bearing a blossom that is white and odoriferous. %0a%3c There is no vegetable production that is more grateful 39 to %0a%3c beasts of burden than this, whether in a green state or whe¬ %0a%3c ther dried and made into hay, in which last case it is sprinkled %0a%3c with water when given to them. It is said that on Mount %0a%3c Parnassus a juice is extracted from it, which is very abun- %0a%3c dant and of a sweet flavour. %0a%3c %0a%3c In other parts of the world, instead of this juice a decoction %0a%3c of it is employed for closing wounds; an eflect equally pro¬ %0a%3c duced by the plant itself, which is beaten up for the purpose %0a%3c and attached to the part affected, thereby preventing inflamma¬ %0a%3c tion. To the decoction wine and honey are added, and in some %0a%3c cases, frankincense, pepper, and myrrh, in the proportion of one %0a%3c third of eacli ingredient; after which it is boiled again in a %0a%3c copper vessel, when required for tooth-ache or defluxions of the %0a%3c eyes. A decoction of the roots, in wine, is curative of griping %0a%3c pains in the bowels, strangury, and ulcerations of the bladder, %0a%3c aud it disperses calculi. The seed is still more powerful as a %0a%3c diuretic, 40 arrests looseness and vomiting, and is particularly %0a%3c %0a%3c 37 “ Grass.” The Triticum repens, or Paspaluna dactylon of Linmeus, %0a%3c our couch-grass. %0a%3c %0a%3c 38 This is probably quite a different production, being the Parnassia %0a%3c palustris, according to Dodonasus; but Pee is inclined to think that it is %0a%3c the Campanula rapunculus of Linnaeus, bell-flower or rampions. %0a%3c %0a%3c 39 pee thinks that this appplies to the plant of Parnassus, and not to %0a%3c the common Gramen. %0a%3c %0a%3c 40 This property, Fee says, is still attributed to couch-grass. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 119.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c DACTYLOS. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 73 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c useful for ■wounrls inflicted by dragons. 41 There are some %0a%3c authorities which give the following prescription for the cuFe %0a%3c of scrofulous sores and inflamed tumours:—From one, two, %0a%3c or three stems, as many, as nine joints must be removed, %0a%3c which must then be wrapped in black wool with the grease in %0a%3c it. The party who gathers them must do so fasting, and must %0a%3c then go, in the same state, to the patient’s house while he is %0a%3c from home. When the patient comes in, the other must say to %0a%3c him three times, “I come fasting to bring a remedy to a fast¬ %0a%3c ing manand must then attach the amulet to his person, re¬ %0a%3c peating the same ceremony three consecutive days. The %0a%3c variety of this plant which has seven 42 joints is considered a %0a%3c most excellent amulet for the cure of head-ache. For excru¬ %0a%3c ciating pains in the bladder, some recommend a decoction of %0a%3c gramen, boiled down in wine to one half, to be taken imme¬ %0a%3c diately after the bath. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 119.-DACTYLOS; FIVE REMEDIES. %0a%3c %0a%3c There arc some authorities who mention three varieties of %0a%3c the pointed gramen. That which has at the extremity five 43 %0a%3c points at the utmost, is called “dactylos.” Twisting these %0a%3c points together, persons introduce them into the nostrils and then %0a%3c withdraw them, with the view of preventing haemorrhage. %0a%3c The second kind, wdiich resembles aizoon, 44 is employed with %0a%3c axle-grease for whitlows and hangnails, and for fleshy excres¬ %0a%3c cences upon the nails: this also is called “ dactylos,” because %0a%3c it is so useful us a remedy for diseases of the fingers. %0a%3c %0a%3c The third 45 kind, which is also known as “ dactylos,” is more %0a%3c diminutive, and is found growing upon walls or tiles.

By some it is known %0a%3c as “ telis,” by others as “ carphos,” and by others again as %0a%3c “ buceras,” 47 or “ segoceras,” 47 the produce of it bearing some %0a%3c resemblance to horns. Among us it is known as “ silicia.” %0a%3c The mode of sowing it Ave have already 48 described on the %0a%3c appropriate occasion. Its properties are desiccative, 18 emollient, %0a%3c and resolA-ent. A decoction of it is useful for many female %0a%3c maladies, indurations for instance, tumours, and contractions of %0a%3c the uterus; in all which cases it is employed as a fomentation or %0a%3c used for a sitting-bath: it is serviceable also as an injection. %0a%3c It removes cutaneous eruptions on the face; and a decoction of %0a%3c it, applied topically with nitre or vinegar, cures diseases of %0a%3c the spleen or liver. In cases of difficult labour, Diodes re¬ %0a%3c commends the seed pounded, in doses of one acetabulum, %0a%3c mixed with boiled 50 must. After taking one third of the mix¬ %0a%3c ture, the patient must use a warm bath, and then, while in a %0a%3c perspiration, she must take another third, and, immediately %0a%3c after leaving the bath, the remainder—this, he says, will prove %0a%3c a most effectual means of obtaining relief. %0a%3c %0a%3c The same authority recommends fenugreek boiled, with %0a%3c barley or linseed, in hydromel, as a pessary for violent pains %0a%3c in the uterus : he prescribes it also as an external application %0a%3c for the loAver regions of the abdomen. He speaks also of %0a%3c treating leprous sores and freckles with a mixture composed %0a%3c of equal proportions of sulphur and meal of fenugreek, recom¬ %0a%3c mending it to be applied repeatedly in the course of the day, %0a%3c due care being taken not to rub the part affected. %0a%3c %0a%3c For the cure of leprosy, Tlieodorus prescribes a mixture of %0a%3c fenugreek, and one fourth part of cleaned nasturtium, the whole %0a%3c to be steeped in the strongest vinegar. Damion used to give %0a%3c a potion by way of emmenagogue, consisting of half an aceta¬ %0a%3c bulum of fenugreek seed in nine cyathi of boiled must 51 and %0a%3c water. There is no doubt too, that a decoction of it is re¬ %0a%3c markably useful for diseases of the uterus and for ulcerations %0a%3c %0a%3c 47 “ Bull’s horn ” or “ goat’s horn.” 48 j n p xviii. c. 39. %0a%3c %0a%3c 49 The seed contains a mucilage, and is considered emollient and resolvent %0a%3c Till recently.

Boiled with mallows and then taken %0a%3c in honied wine, fenugreek is extolled in the highest terms, as %0a%3c serviceable for affections of the uterus and intestines. Indeed, %0a%3c the very steam that arises from the decoction may be produc¬ %0a%3c tive of considerable benefit. A decoction too of fenugreek seed %0a%3c is a corrective of the rank odours of the armpits. Meal of %0a%3c fenugreek, with wine and nitre, speedily removes ring-worm %0a%3c and dandriff of the head ; and a decoction of it in hydromel, %0a%3c with the addition of axle-grease, is used for the cure of diseases %0a%3c of the generative organs, inflamed tumours, imposthumes of %0a%3c the parotid glands, gout in the feet and hands, maladies of %0a%3c the joints, and denudations of the bones. Kneaded with %0a%3c vinegar, it effects the cure of sprains, and, boiled in oxymel %0a%3c only, it is used as a liniment for affections of the spleen. %0a%3c Kneaded with wine, it acts as a detergent upon carcinomatous %0a%3c sores; after which, applied with honey, it effects a perfect cure. %0a%3c A pottage too is made of this meal, which is taken for ulcera¬ %0a%3c tions of the chest and chronic coughs; it is kept boiling a con¬ %0a%3c siderable time, in order to remove the bitterness, 62 after which %0a%3c honey is added. %0a%3c %0a%3c We shall now proceed to speak of the plants which have %0a%3c gained a higher degree of reputation. %0a%3c %0a%3c Summary. —Remedies, narratives, and observations, eleven %0a%3c hundred and seventy-six. %0a%3c %0a%3c Roman authors quoted. —C.
