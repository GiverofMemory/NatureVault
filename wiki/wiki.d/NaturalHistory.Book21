( 1 .) —the NATUKE OF FLOWERS AND GARLANDS. %0a%0aCato has recommended that flow'ers for raaJring chaplets %0ashould also be cultivated in the garden ; varieties remarkable %0afor a delicacy which it is quite impossible to express, inas¬ %0amuch as no individual can find such facilities for describing %0athem as Nature does for bestowing on them their numerous tints %0a—Nature, who here in especial shows herself in a sportive %0amood, and takes a delight in the prolific display of her varied %0aproductions. The other' plants she has produced for our use %0aand our nutriment, and to them accordingly she has granted %0ayears and even ages of duration : but as for the fiowers and %0atheir perfumes, she has given them birth for but a day—a %0amighty lesson to man, we see, to teach him that that which in %0aits career is the most beauteous and the most attractive to the %0aeye, is the very first to fade and die. %0a%0aEven the limner’s art itself possesses no resources for re¬ %0aproducing the colours of the fiowers in all their varied tints %0aand combinations, whether we view them in groups alter¬ %0anately blending their hues, or whether arranged in festoons, each %0avariety by * itself, now assuming a circular form, now running %0aobliquely, and now disposed in a spiral pattern ; or whether, %0aas we see sometimes, one wreath is interwoven within another. %0a%0aCHAP. 2 . ( 2 .) —GARLANDS AND CHAPLETS. %0a%0aThe ancients used chaplets of diminutive size, called %0a“ struppifrom which comes our name for a chaplet, “ stro- %0a%0a* See B. xxii. c. 1. %0a%0a2 “ Sive privatis generum funiculis in orbem, in obliquum, in ambitnm ; %0aquaedam coronae per coronas currunt.” As we know but little of tbe forms %0aof the garlands and chaplets of tbe ancients, the exact translation of this %0apassage is very doubtful. %0a%0a^ According to Boettiger, the w'ord “ struppus ” means a string arranged %0aos a fillet or diadem. ' %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 3.] %0a%0a%0aTHK ART OF MAKING GARLANDS. %0a%0a%0a305 %0a%0a%0aphiolum.” Indeed, it was only by very slow degrees that %0athis last word"* became generalized, as the chaplets that were %0aused at sacrifices, or were granted as the reward of militaiy %0avalour, asserted their exclusive right to the name of “ corona.” %0aAs for garlands, Avhen they came to be made of flowers, they %0areceived the name of “ serta,” from the verb “ sero,”® or %0aelse from our word “ series.”® The use’ of flowers for gar¬ %0alands is not so very ancient, among the Greeks even. %0a%0aCUAP. 3. — WHO INVENTED THE ART OF MAKING GARLANDS : %0a%0aWHEN THEY FIRST RECEIVED THE NAME OF “ COROLL.®,” AND %0a%0aFOR WHAT REASON. %0a%0aFor in early times it was the usage to crown the victors in %0athe sacred contests with branches of trees: and it was only %0aat a later period, that they began to vary their tints by the %0acombination® of flowers, to heighten the effect in turn by their %0acolour and their smell—an invention due to the ingenuity of %0athe painter Pausias, at Sicyon,® and the garland-maker Gly- %0acera, a female to whom he was greatly attached, and. whose %0ahandiwork was imitated by him in colours. Challenging him %0ato a trial of skill, she would repeatedly vary her designs, and %0athus it was in reality a contest between art and Nature ; a fact %0awhich we find attested by pictures of that artist even still in %0aexistence, more particularly the one known as the “ Stephane- %0al»locos,”'“ in which he has given a likeness of Glycera herself. %0aThis invention, therefore, is only to be traced to later than the %0aHundredth’’ Olympiad. %0a%0aChaplets of flowers being now the fashion, it Avas not long %0abefore those came into vogue which are known to us as %0a%0a^ Fee makes the word “vocahulum” apply to “corona,” and not to %0a“ struppns but the passage will hardly admit of that rendering. %0a%0a* “To bind” or “join together.’’ %0a%0a® A “ connected line,” from the verb “ sero.” %0a%0a’ By “quod,” Hardouin takes Pliny to mean, the use of the word %0aciraprbv, among the Greeks, corresponding with the Latin word “ sertum.” %0a%0a** These chaplets, we learn from Festus, were called “ pancarpiae.” %0aThe olive, oak, laurel, and myrtle, were the trees first used for chaplets. %0a%0a® See B. ixxv. c. 40. %0a%0a. *® The “ Chaplet-weaver.” See B. xxxv. c. 40. %0a%0a” B.C. 380. %0a%0aTOL.

By slow degrees, too, the name %0awas introduced at Borne, these garlands being known there %0aat first as “ corollae,” a designation given them to express %0athe remarkable delicacy of their texture. In more recent %0atimes, again, when the chaplets presented were made of thin %0aplates of copper, gilt or silvered, they assumed the name %0aof “ corollaria.” %0a%0aCHAP. 4 . ( 3 .) —WHO WAS THE FIRST TO GIVE CHAPLETS WITH %0aLEAVES OF silver AND GOLD. LEMNISCI : WHO WAS THE FIRST %0aTO EMBOSS THEM. %0a%0aCrassus Dives was the first who gave chaplets with arti¬ %0aficial leaves of silver and gold, at the games celebrated by him. %0aTo embellish these chaplets, and to confer additional honour %0aon them, lemnisci were added, in imitation of the Etruscan %0achaplets, which ought properly to have none but lemnisci %0amade of gold. For a long period these lemnisci were desti¬ %0atute of ornament P. Claudius Pulcher*® was the first who %0ataught us to emboss*® them, and added leaves of tinsel to the %0alaminee®® of which the lemniscus was formed. %0a%0aCHAP. 5 . —THE GREAT HONOUR IN WHICH CHAPLETS WERE HELD %0aBY THE ANCIENTS. %0a%0aChaplets, however, were always held in a high degree of %0aestimation, those even which were acquired at the public %0agames. For it was the usage of the citizens to go down in %0aperson to take part in the contests of the Circus, and to %0asend their slaves and horses thither as well. Hence it is that %0awe find it thus written in the laws of the Twelve Tables: %0a%0a12 From Atlienoeus, B. xv. c. 2, et seq., we learn that the Egyptian %0achaplets were made of ivy, narcissus, pomegranate blossoms, &c. %0a%0a‘2 “Corolla,” being the diminutive of “corona.” %0a%0a1* Or tinsel. is The “ Rich.” %0a%0aIS Ribbons or streamers. i^ “Puri.” %0a%0aIS Consul, A.u.c. 570. %0a%0aIS Or “engrave,” “caelare.” Jle is probably speaking here of golden %0alemnisci. %0a%0a20 “ Philyr®.” This was properly the inner bark of the linden-tree; %0abut it is not improbable that thin plates of metal were also so called, from %0ache resemblance. The passage, however, admits of various modes of ex¬ %0aplanation. %0a%0a*• 1 %0a%0a%0aChap. 6.] %0a%0a%0aCHAPLETS. %0a%0a%0a307 %0a%0a%0a“ If any person has gained a chaplet himself, or by his %0amoney,** let the same be given to him as the reward of his %0aprowess.” There is no doubt that by the words “ gained by %0ahis money,” the laws meant a chaplet which had been gained %0aby his slaves or horses. Well then, what was the honour ac¬ %0aquired thereby ? It was the right secured bythe victor, for %0ahimself and for his parents, after death, to be crowned with¬ %0aout fail, while the body was laid out in the house,** and on its %0abeing carried** to the tomb. %0a%0aOn other occasions, chaplets were not indiscriminately %0aworn, not even those which had been won in the games. %0a%0aCHAP. 6.-THE SEVERITY OF THE AHCIEHTS IN REFERENCE TO %0a%0aCHAPLETS. %0a%0aIndeed the rules upon this point were remarkably severe. %0aL. Fulvius, a banker,** having been accused, at the time of %0athe Second Punic War, of looking down from the balcony*® %0aof his house upon the Forum, with a chaplet of roses upon %0ahis head, was imprisoned by order of the Senate, and was not %0aliberated before the war was brought to a close. P. Muna- %0atius, having placed upon his head a chaplet of flowers taken %0afrom the statue of Marsyas,*® was condemned by the Trium¬ %0aviri to be put in chains. Upon his making appeal to the %0atribunes of the people, they refused to intercede in his behalf %0a—a very different state of things to that at Athens, where %0athe young men,*’ in their dnmken revelry, were in the habit, %0a%0a** “ Pecunia.” Fee compares this usage with the employment of jockies %0aat horse-races in England and France. %0a%0a“ Intus positus esset.” •* “ Foris ferretur.” %0a%0a2* Or “ money-changer,” ‘‘ argentarius.” %0a%0a“ “E pergula sua.” Scaliger thinks that the “pergula” was a part %0aof a house built out into the street, while, according to Ernesti,^ it was a %0alittle room in the upper part of a house. In B. xxxv. c. 36, it clearly %0ameans a room on the ground-floor. %0a%0a26 In the Fora of ancient cities there was frequently a statue of this my¬ %0athological personage, with one hand erect, in token, Servius says (on %0aB. iv. 1. 58 of the iEneid), of the freedom of the state, Marsyas having been %0athe minister of Bacchus, the god of liberty. His statue in the Forum of %0aRome was the place of assembly for the courtesans of that city, who used %0ato crown it with chaplets ot flow’crs. See also Horace i. Sat. 6. 1. 120; %0aJuvenal, Sat. 9. 1. 1 and 2; and Martial,ii. Ep. 64.1. 7. %0a%0a27 Ciijacius thinks that Pliny has in view here Polemon of Athens, who %0awhen a young man, in his drunken revelry, burst into the school of Xeno- %0acratcs. the philosopher, with his fellow-revellers, wearing his festive gar- %0a%0a%0aPLIXT’S XATUKAIi lIISrOKT.

Among ourselves, no such instance of %0aa similar licentiousness is lo be found, unless, indeed, in the %0acase of the daughter*® of the late Emperor Augustus, who, in %0aher nocturnal debaucheries, placed a chaplet on the statue^* %0aof JIarsyas, conduct deeply deplored in the letters of that %0agod.®" %0a%0aCHAP. 7.-A CITIZEN DECKED WITH FLOWEES BY THE HOMAN %0a%0aPEOPLE. %0a%0aScipio is the only person that ever received from the Eoman %0apeople the honour of being decked with flowers. This %0aScipio received the surname of Serapio,®^ from his remarkable %0aresemblance to a certain person of that name who dealt in %0apigs. He died in his tribuneship, greatly beloved by the %0apeople, and in every way worthy of the family of the African!. %0aThe property he left was not sufficient to pay the expenses of %0ahis burial; upon which the people made a subscription and %0acontracted®* for his funeral, flowers being scattered upon the %0abody from every possible quarter®® as it was borne along. %0a%0aCUAP. 8. — PLAITED CHAPLETS. NEEDLE-WORK CHAPLETS. %0a%0aNARD-LEAF CHAPLETS. SILKEN CHAPLETS. %0a%0aIn those days, too, chaplets were employed in honour of the %0agods, the Lares, public as well as domestic, the sepulchres,®* %0aand the Manes. The highest place, however, in public esti¬ %0amation, was held by the plaited chaplet; such as we find used %0a%0aland on his head. Being arrested, however, by the discourse, he stopped %0ato listen, and at length, tearing off the garland, determined to enter on a %0amore abstemious course of life. Becoming an ardent disciple of Xeno- %0acrates, he ultimately succeeded him at the head of the school. The pas¬ %0asage as given in the text, from its apparent incompleteness, would appear %0ato he in a mutilated state. %0a%0a^ Julia.

In later times, the rose chaplet has %0abeen adopted, and luxury arose at last to such a pitch that a %0achaplet was held in no esteem at all if it did not consist en¬ %0atirely of leaves sown together with the needle. More recently, %0aagain, they have been imported from India, or from nations %0abeyond the countries of India. %0a%0aBut it is looked upon as the most refined of all, to present %0achaplets made of nard leaves, or else of silk of many colours %0asteeped in unguents. Such is the pitch to which the luxu¬ %0ariousness of our women has at last arrived! %0a%0aCHAP. 9.-AHTHORS WHO HAVE WRITTEN ON FLOWERS. AN %0a%0aANECDOTE RELATIVE TO Q0EEN CLEOPATRA AND CHAPLETS. %0a%0aAmong the Greeks, the physicians Mnesitheus and Calli¬ %0amachus have written separate treatises on the subject of %0achaplets, making mention of such flowers as are injurious to %0athe head.®® For, in fact, the health is here concerned to some %0aextent, as it is at the moments of carousal and gaiety in par¬ %0aticular that penetrating odours steal insidiously upon the %0abrain—witness an instance in the wicked cunning displayed %0aupon one occasion by Cleopatra. %0a%0aAt the time when preparations were making for the battle %0athat was eventually fought at Actiura, Antonius held the %0aqueen in such extreme distrust as to be in dread of her very %0aattentions even, and would not so much as touch his food, %0aunless another person had tasted it first. Upon this, the %0aqueen, it is said, wishing to amuse herself with his fears, had %0a- the extremities of the flowers in a chaplet dipped in poison, and %0athen placed it upon her head.®^ After a time, as the hilarity %0aincreased apace, she challenged Antonius to swallow the chap¬ %0aes At the conclusion of the festival of Mars on the 1st of March, and %0afor several successive days. These entertainments were celebrated in the %0aTemple of that god, and were proverbial for their excellence. %0a%0a“ It is a well-known fact, as Fee remarks, that the smell of flowers is %0aproductive, in some persons, of head-ache, nausea, and vertigo. He states %0aalso that persons have been known to meet their death from sleeping all %0anight in the midst of odoriferous flowers. %0a%0a“Ipsaque capiti imposita.” Holland and Ajasson render this as %0atlioimh Cleopatra placed the garland on Antony’s head, and not her owu. %0aLittr'^ agrees with the translation here adopted. %0a%0a%0a310 %0a%0a%0aPliny’s natubal histoey. %0a%0a%0a[nook XXI. %0a%0a%0alets, mixed up with their drink. Who, under such circumstances %0aas these, could have apprehended treachery? Accordingly, %0athe leaves were stripped from off the chaplet, and thrown into %0aihe cup. Just as Antonius was on the very point of drinking, %0ashe arrested his arm with her hand.—“ Behold, Marcus An¬ %0atonius,” said she, “ the woman against whom you are so care¬ %0aful to take these new precautions of yours in employing your %0atasters! And would then, if I could exist without you, either %0ameans or opportunity of effecting my purpose be wanting to %0ame?” Saying this, she ordered a man to be brought from %0aprison, and made him drink off the potion; he did so, and %0afell dead®® upon the spot. %0a%0aBesides the two authors above-mentioned, Theophrastus,®* %0aamong the Greeks, has written on the subject of flowers. %0aSome of our own writers also have given the title of “ Antho- %0alogica” to their works, but no one, to my knowledge at least, %0ahas treated expressly^® of flowers. In fact, we ourselves have %0ano intention here of discussing the mode of wearing chaplets, %0afor that would be frivolous^^ indeed ; but shall proceed to %0astate such particulars in relation to flowers as shall appear to %0aus deserving of remark. %0a%0aCHAP. 10 . ( 4 .) —THE EOSE : TWELVE VAEIETIES OF IT. %0a%0aThe people of our country were acquainted with but very %0afew garland flowers among the garden plants, and those few %0ahardly any but the violet and the rose. The plant which bears %0athe rose is, properly speaking, more of a thorn than a shrub— %0aindeed, we sometimes find it growing on a bramble^* even; %0athe flower having, even then, a pleasant smell, though by no %0ameans penetrating. The flower in all roses is originally en¬ %0aclosed in a bud,^® with a grained surface within, which gra¬ %0adually swells, and assumes the form of a green pointed cone, %0asimilar to our alabaster^^ unguent boxes in shape. Gradually %0a%0aFee remarks that we know of no poisons, hydrocyanic or prussic acid %0aexcepted, so instantaneous in their effects as this; and that it is very %0adoubtful if they were acquainted with that poison. %0a%0aHist. Plant. B. vi. cc. 6, 7. “ Persecutus est.” %0a%0aA characteristic, it would appear, of the greater part of the inform¬ %0aation already given in this Book. %0a%0aHe alludes to the wild rose or eglantine. See B. xvi. c. 71. %0a%0a“ Granoso cortice.” %0a%0a^ Boxes of a pyramidal shape. See B. ix. c. 56. %0a%0a%0aChap. 10.1 %0a%0a%0aTHE HOSE. %0a%0a%0a311 %0a%0a%0aacquiring a ruddy tint, this bud opens little by little, until at %0alast it comes into full blow, developing the calyx, and em¬ %0abracing the yellow-pointed filaments which stand erect in the %0acentre of it. %0a%0aThe employment of the rose in chaplets is, so to say, the %0aleast^® use that is made of it. The flower is steeped in oil, a %0apractice which has prevailed from the times of the Trojan war, %0aas Homer‘® bears witness; in addition to which, it now forms %0aan ingredient in our unguents, as mentioned on a previous %0aoccasion.^^ It is employed also by itself for certain medicinal %0apurposes, and is used in plasters and eye-salves^* for its pene¬ %0atrating qualities : it is used, also, to perfume the delicacies of %0aour banquets, and is never attended with any noxious results. %0a%0aThe most esteemed kinds of rose among us are those of %0aPrseneste'** and Campania.®* Some persons have added to these %0avarieties the rose of Miletus,®^ the flower of which is an ex¬ %0atremely brilliant red, and has never more than a dozen petals. %0aThe next to it is the rose of TrachjTi,®* not so red as the last, %0aand then that of Alabanda,®® with whitish petals, but not so %0ahighly esteemed. The least esteemed of all, however, is the %0athorn rose,®^ the petals of which are numerous, but extremely %0a%0aStill, even for that purpose the rose Avas very extensively used. One %0aancient author states that, even in the middle of winter, the more luxurious %0aliomans were not satisfied without roses swimming in their Falernian wine; %0aand we find Horace repeatedly alluding to the chaplets of roses worn by %0athe guests at banquets. Hence probably arose the expression, “Under %0athe rose.” Fee is evidently mistaken in thinking that Pliny implies here, %0athat it was but rarely used in chaplets. %0a%0aII. xxiii. 1. 186. B. xiii. c. 2. %0a%0a“Collyriis.” %0a%0aClusius Avas of opinion that this was the Provence rose, the Rosa %0aGallica of Uinnaeus. %0a%0aThe same rose, probably, of which Virgil says, Georg. B. iv. 1. 119, %0a“ Bifcrique rosaria Paesti”—" And the rose-beds of Paestum, that bear %0atwice in the year.” It has been suggested that it is identical with the %0aBosa alba vulgaris major of Bauhin, the Rosa alba of Decandolle; but, %0aas F4e says, it is very questionable if this is correct, this white rose blossom¬ %0aing but once a year. _ . i i %0a%0aA simple variety of the Rosa Gallica of Linnaeus, Fee thinks. %0a%0aSee B. iv. c. 14. According to J. Bauhin, this is the pale, flesh- %0acoloured rose, called the “ rose of France,”—the “ Rosa rubello flore, %0amajore, pleno, incarnata vulgo.’’ Others, again, take it to be the Damascus %0arose. %0a%0a“ Sec B. V. c. 29. A variety of the white rose, F^e thinks, the de¬ %0atermination of Avhich must be sought among the Eglantines. %0a%0a^ “Spiniola.” A variety belonging to or approaching the Eglantine %0a%0a%0a312 %0a%0a%0aPL,^^■r’s NATUEAL HI3T0UT. %0a%0a%0a[Book XXI. %0a%0a%0asmall. The essential points of difference in the rose are the %0anumber*^ of the petals, the comparative number*® of thorns on %0athe stem, the colour, and the smelj.. The number of the petals, %0awhich is never less than five, goes on increasing in amount, %0atill we find one variety with as many as a hundred, and %0athence known as the “ centifolia :”*■ in Italy, it is to be found %0ain Campania, and in Greece, in the vicinity of Philippi, though %0athis last is not the place of its natural*® growth. Mount Pan- %0agaeus,*® in the same vicinity, produces a rose with numerous %0apetals of diminutive size : the people of those parts are in the %0ahabit of transplanting it, a method which greatly tends to im¬ %0aprove its growth. This kind, however, is not remarkable for %0aits smell, nor yet is the rose which has a very large or very %0abroad petal: indeed, we may state in a few words, that the %0abest proof of the perfume of the flower is the comparative %0aroughness of the calyx.®® %0a%0aCaepio, who lived in the reign of the Emperor Tiberius, as¬ %0aserts that the centifolia is never employed for chaplets, except %0aat the extreme®^ points of union as it were, being remarkable %0aneither for its smelF nor its beauty. There is another variety %0a%0ain all probability. Fee makes mention here of a kind called the Rosa %0amyriacantha by Decandolle (the “ thousand-thornrose”), which is found in %0agreat abundance in the south of Europe, and other parts of it. %0a%0aFee remarks on this passage, that the beauty of the flower and the %0anumber of the petals are always in an inverse proportion to the number of %0athorns, which disappear successively the more carefully the plant is culti¬ %0avated. %0a%0a5’ This is most probably the meaning of “ Aspcritate, levore.” %0a%0aStill known as the Rosa centifolia.” Its petals sometimes exceed %0athree hundred in number ; and it is the most esteemed of all for its frag¬ %0arant smell. %0a%0a“ Non suae terrae proventu.” %0a%0aThis rose is mentioned also by Theophrastus, Hist. Plant. B. vi. c, 6. %0aFrom the description that Pliny gives of it. Fee is inclined to think that %0ait is some variety of the Rosa rubrifolia, which is often found in moun¬ %0atainous localities. %0a%0aThis assertion is borrowed from Theophrastus, Hist. Plant. B. vi. c. %0a6. Fee remarks that there is no truth in it. It is not improbable, how¬ %0aever, that the word “cortex” here may mean, not the calyx, but the bark %0aof the stem, in reference to its exemptiom from thorns. The to %0a%0aKUTw of Theophrastus would seem to admit of that rendering. See Note %0a^ above. %0a%0a“ Extremes velut ad cardines.” %0a%0aThis is not the case with the Rosa centifolia of modern botany. See %0aNote above. It is not improbable, however, that the reading is “pro- %0ababilis,” and that this passage belongs to the next sentence. %0a%0a%0aChap. 10.] • %0a%0a%0aTHE BOSE. %0a%0a%0a313 %0a%0a%0aof rose, too, called the “Grecian” rose by our people, and %0a“ lychnis by the Greeks: it grows nowhere except in %0ahumid soils, and has never more than five petals: it does not %0aexceed the violet in size, and is destitute of smell. There is %0aanother kind, again, known to us as the “ Grsecula,” the %0apetals of which are tightly rolled together, and which never %0aopen except when pressed in the hand, it having always the %0aappearance, in fact, of being in bud: the petals of it are re¬ %0amarkably large. Another kind, again, springs from a stem %0alike that of the mallow, the leaves being similar to those of %0athe olive—the name given to it is “ macetum.”®® There is %0athe rose of autumn, too, known to us as the “ coroniola,”®® %0aM'hich is of a middle size, between the varieties just mentioned. %0aAll these kinds, however, are destitute of smell, with the %0aexception of the coroniola, and the one which grows on the %0abramble so extended is the scope for fictitious®® productions! %0a%0aAnd, indeed, the genuine rose, for the most part, is indebted %0afor its qualities to the nature of the soil. That of Cyrenae®® is %0athe most odoriferous of all, and hence it is that the unguents %0aof that place are so remarkably fine: at Carthage, again, in %0aSpain, there are early''® roses throughout all the winter. The %0atemperature, too, of the climate is not without its influence : %0afor in some years we find the roses much less odoriferous than %0ain others; in addition to which, their smell is always more %0apowerful when grown in dry soils’' than in humid ones. The %0a%0a®® The Lychnis, Fee remarks, is erroneously classed by Pliny among %0athe roses. It is generally agreed among naturalists that it is the garden %0aflower, the Agrostemma coronaria of Linnaeus; which, however, does not %0agrow in humid soils, but in steep, rocky places. %0a%0a“ Or “small Greek” rose. Some commentators have identified it with %0athe Rosa silvestris, odorata, flore albo of C. Bauhin, a wild white rose. %0a%0a“ Sillig thinks that this may moan the “Macedonian” rose. Another %0areading is “moscheuton.” Fee says that it is not a rose at all, but one of %0athe Malvaceae belonging to the genus Alcaea; one variety of which is %0acalled the Alccea rosa. %0a%0a“ Or “little chaplet.” Possibly a variety of the Eglantine, the Rosa %0acanina or dog-rose. Fee suggests. %0a%0aThe Eglantine. %0a%0aThis seems to be the meaning of “ tot modis adulteratur the roses %0awithout smell appearing to him to be not genuim roses. %0a%0aThe Rosa Damasccna of Miller, Fee thinks, our Damascus rose. %0a%0a™ The earliest rose in France and Spain, Fee says, is the “pompon,” %0athe variety Pomponma of the Rosa centifolia. %0a%0aThis is consistent with modern experience. %0a%0a%0a314 %0a%0a%0apliny’s natural history. %0a%0a%0a[Book XXI. %0a%0a%0arose does not admit of being planted in either a rich or an %0aargillaceous soil, nor yet on irrigated land; being contented %0awith a thin, light earth, and more particularly attached to %0aground on which old building rubbish has been laid. %0a%0aThe rose of Campania is early, that of Miletus late, but it is %0athe rose of Prseneste that goes off the very latest of all. For %0athe rose, the ground is generally dug to a greater depth than it %0ais for corn, but not so deep as for the vine. It grows but very %0aslowly’’^ from the seed, which is found in the calyx beneath the %0apetals of the flower, covered with a sort of down; hence it is %0athat the method of grafting is usually the one preferred, or else %0apropagation from the eyes of the root, as in tlie reed.” One %0akind is grafted, which bears a pale flower, with thorny %0abranches of a remarkable length; it belongs to the quinquefolia %0avariety, being one of the Greek roses.’* All roses are improved %0aby being pruned and cauterized; transplanting, too, makes %0athem grow, like the vine, all the better, and with the greatest %0arapidity. The slips are cut some four fingers in length or %0amore, and are planted immediately after the setting of the %0aVergiliae; then, while the west winds are prevalent, they are %0atransplanted at intervals of a foot, the earth being frequently %0aturned up about them. %0a%0aPersons whose object it is to grow early roses, make a hole %0aa foot in width about the root, and pour warm water into it, %0aat the period when the buds are beginning to put forth.” %0a%0aCHAP. 11.

The moaning of this passage, %0ahowever, is extremely doubtful. “ Unum genus inseritur pallidae, spinos®, %0alongissimis virgis, quinquifoli®, quse Gracis altera est.” %0a%0aIf the water was only lukewarm, Fee says, it would be of no use, %0aand if hotter, the speedy death of the tree would be the result. %0a%0a“ Quadam cognatione.” He alludes to a maceration of the petals of %0athe rose and lily in oil. The aroma of the lily, Fee says, has not been %0afixed by any method yet found. %0a%0aSee B. xiii. c. 2. %0a%0a%0aChap. 11.] %0a%0a%0aTHE LILT. %0a%0a%0a315 %0a%0a%0aBlended, too, with roses, the lily'^ produces a remarkably fine %0aeffect; for it begins to make its appearance, in fact, just as the %0arose is in the -very middle of its season. There is no fiowcr %0athat grows to a greater height than the lily, sometimes, in¬ %0adeed, as much as three cubits; the head of it being always %0adrooping, as though the neck of the flower were unable to %0asupport its weight. The whiteness of the lily is quite remark¬ %0aable, the petals being striated on the exterior; the flower is %0anarrow at the base, and gradually expanding in shape like a %0atapering’® cup with the ed^es curving outwards, the ^e pistils %0aof the flower, and the stamens with their antherae of a saffron %0acolour, standing erect in the middle.®® Hence the perfume of %0athe lily, as well as its colour, is two-fold, there being one for %0athe petals and another for the stamens. The difference, how¬ %0aever, between them is but very small, and when the flower is %0aemployed for making lily unguents and oils, the petals are %0anever rejected. %0a%0aThere is a flower, not unlike the lily, produced by the plant %0aknown to us as the “ convolvulus.”®’ It grows among shrubs, %0ais totally destitute of smell, and has not the yellow antherse of %0athe lily within : only vying with it in its whiteness, it would %0aalmost appear to be the rough sketch®® made by Nature when %0ashe was learning how to make the lily. The white lily is %0apropagated in all the various ways which are employed for the %0acultivation of the rose,®® as also by means of a certain tearlike %0a%0aThe Lilium candidum of Linnaeus. Fee remarks that the “ Lilium” %0aof the Eomans and the Xeipiov of the Greeks is evidently derived from %0athe laleh of the Persians. %0a%0a“ Calathi.” The “calathus” was a work-basket of tapering shape ; %0ait was also used for carrying fruits and flowers, Ovid, Art. Am. ii. 264. %0aCups, too, for wine were called by this name, Virg. Eel. v. 7i. %0a%0aAs this passage has been somewhat amplified in the translation, it %0awill perhaps be as well to insert it: “ Eesupinis per ambitum labris, te- %0anuique pilo et staminum stantibus in medio crocis.” %0a%0aThe Convolvulus sajpium of modem botany; the only resemblance %0ain which to the lily is in the colour, it being totally dififerent in every other %0arespect. %0a%0a“ Eudimentum.” She must have set to work in a very roundabout %0away, Fee thinks, and one in which it would be quite impossible for a na¬ %0aturalist to follow her. %0a%0aThe white lily is reproduced from the oflTsets of the bulbs; and, ns %0aFee justly remarks, it is highly absurd to compare the mode of culti¬ %0avation with that of the rose, which is propagated from slips. %0a%0a%0a316 %0a%0a%0aPliny’s natural uistout. %0a%0a%0a[Book XXI %0a%0a%0agum®^ which belongs to it, similarly to hipposelinum®® in fact: %0aindeed, there is no plant that is more prolific than this, a sin¬ %0agle root often giving birth to as man)'^ as fifty bulbs.®® There %0ais, also, a red lily, known by the name of “ crinon’’®’ to the %0aGreeks, though there are some authors who call the flower of %0ait “ cjmorrodon.”®® The most esteemed are those of Antiochia %0aand Laodicea in Syria, and next to them that of Phaselis.®** %0aTo the fourth rank belongs the flower that grows in Italy. %0a%0aCHAP. 12 . —THE NAKCISSUS : THREE VARIETIES OF IT. %0a%0aThere is a purple®” lily, too, which sometimes has a double %0astem; it differs only from the other lilies in having a more %0afleshy root and a bulb of larger size, but undivided: ®‘ the %0aname given to it is “ narcissus.”®® A second variety of this lily %0ahas a white flower, with a purple corolla. There is also this %0adifference between the ordinaiy lily and the narcissus, that in %0athe latter the leaves spring from the root of the plant. The %0afinest are those which grow on the mountains of Lycia. A %0athird variety is similar to the others in every respect, except %0athat the corolla of the plant is green. They are all of them %0alate®® flowers: indeed, they only bloom after the setting of %0aA returns,®* and at the time of the autumnal equinox. %0a%0aThis absurd notion is derived from Theophrastus, Hist. Plant. B. ii. %0ac. 2, and B, vi. c. 6. ■ See B. xix. c. 48. %0a%0aThe root really consists of certain fine fibres, to which the bulbs, or %0arather cloves or offsets, are attached. %0a%0aJudging from what Theocritus says, in his 35th Idyl, the “ crinon” %0awould appear to have been a white lily. Sprengel, however, takes the red %0alily of Pliny to be the scarlet lily, the Lilium Chalcedonicum of Linnaeus. %0a%0abs Or “ dog-rosea name now given to one of the wild roses. %0a%0aSee B. xiii. c. 9. %0a%0aPee remarks, that it is singular that Pliny, as also Virgil, Eel. v. 1. 38, %0ashould have given the epithet “ purpureus” to the Narcissus. It is owing. %0aFee says, to the red nectary of the flower, which is also bordered with a %0avery bright red. Into cloves or offsets. %0a%0aThe Narcissus poeticus of Linnaeus.

Fee says, the Narcissus poeticus blossoms at the end of %0aApril, and sooner, probably, in the climates of Greece and Italy. %0a%0a^ See B. xviii. c. 76. It is just possible that Pliny and Theophrastus %0amay be speaking of the Narcissus serotinus of Linnajus, which is found in %0agreat abundance in the southern provinces of Naples, and is undoubtedly %0atiie flower alluded to by Virgil in the words, “Nec sera comantem Narcis- %0asum,” Georg, iv. 11. 122, 123. %0a%0a%0aChap. 14.] %0a%0a%0aTHE TIOLET. %0a%0a%0a317 %0a%0a%0aCHAP. 13 . -HOW SEED IS STAINED TO PRODDCE TINTED FLOWERS. %0a%0aThere has been invented®’ also a method of tinting the lily, %0athanks to the taste of mankind for monstrous productions. %0aThe dried stalks®® of the lily are tied together in the month of %0aJuly, and hung up in the smoke: then, in the following %0aMarch, when the small knots®’ are beginning to disclose them¬ %0aselves, the stalks are left to steep in the lees of black or Greek %0awine, in order that they may contract its colour, and are then %0aplanted out in small trenches, some semi-sextarii of wine-lees %0abeing poured around them. By this method purple lilies are %0aobtained, it being a very remarkable thing that we should be %0aable to dye a plant to such a degree as to make it produce a %0acoloured flower. %0a%0a%0aCHAP. 14 .

THE FIVE VARIETIES %0aOF THE YELLOW VIOLET. %0a%0aKext after the roses and the lilies, the violet is held in the %0ahighest esteem: of this there are several varieties, the pur¬ %0aple,®® the yellow, and the white, all of them reproduced from %0aplants, like the cabbage. The purple violet, which springs %0aup spontaneously in sunny spots, with a thin, meagre soil, has %0alarger petals than the others, springing immediately from the %0aroot, which is of a fleshy substance. This violet has a name, %0atoo, distinct from the other wild kinds, being called “ion, ®® %0aand from it the iantbine ’ cloth takes its name. %0a%0aAmong the cultivated kinds, the yellow® violet is held in the %0agreatest esteem.

The marine violet is surpassed, %0atoo, by the other in smell; that of the caltha being very power¬ %0aful. The smell, too, is no less powerful in the plant known as %0athe “ scopa regia;”® but there it is the leaves of the plant, %0aand not the flowers, that are odoriferous. %0a%0aCHAP. 16 .- THE BACCHAR. THE COMBRETUM. ASARCM. %0a%0aThe bacchar,’ too, by some persons known as ‘‘field nard,” %0a%0a3 This has been identified with the Cheiranthus incanus, the Cheiranthus %0atricuspidatus of the shores of the Mediterranean, the Hesperis maritima of %0aLinnaeus ; also, by some commentators, with the Campanula Medium of %0aLinnaeus. %0a%0a^ So called, according to Pintianus and Salmasius, from Galatia, a town %0aof Italy. Fee adopts the reading “ Calathiana,” and considers it to have %0areceived that name from its resemblance to the Caltha mentioned in the %0anext Chapter. Dalechamps identifies it with the Digitalis purpurea; %0aGessner, Dodonaeus, and Thalius, with the Gentiana pneumonanthe, others %0awith the Gentiana ciliata and Pannonica, and Sprengel with the Gentiana %0averna of Linnaeus. Fee admits himself totally at a loss on the subject. %0a%0a3 ‘‘ Concolori amplitudine." Gronovius, with considerable justice, ex¬ %0apresses himself at a loss as to the exact meaning of these words. If %0aSprengel and Salmasius are right in their conjectures that the Caltha of %0aPliny and Virgil is the marigold, our Calendula officinalis, the passage %0acannot mean that the flower of it is of the same size and colour with %0aany variety of the violet mentioned in the preceding Chapter. From the %0adescription given of it by Dioscorides, it is more than probable that the %0aCaltha of the ancients is not the marigold, and Hardouin is probably %0aright in his conjecture that Pliny intends to describe a variety of the violet %0aunder the name. Fee is at a loss as to its identification. %0a%0a® Or “ royal broom.” Sprengel thinks that this is the Chenopodium %0aBcoparia, a plant common in Greece and Italy; and Fee is inclined to %0acoincide with that opinion, though, as he says, there are numerous other %0aplants with odoriferous leaves and pliant shoots, as its name, broom, would %0aseem to imply. Other writers would identify it with a Sideritis, and %0aothers, again, with an Achillaea. %0a%0aSee B. xii. c. 26. Fee is inclined to coincide with Euellius, and to %0aidentify this with the Digitalis purpurea, clown’s spikenard, or our Lady’s %0a%0a%0aChap. 17.] %0a%0a%0aSAFFliON. %0a%0a%0a319 %0a%0a%0ais odoriferous in the root only. In former times, it was the %0apractice to make imguents of this root, as we learn from the %0apoet Aristophanes, a writer of the Ancient Comedy; from %0awhich circumstance some persons have erroneously given the %0aname of “ exotic to the plant. The smell of it strongly re¬ %0asembles that of cinnamomum; and the plant grows in thin %0asoils, which are free from all humidity. %0a%0aThe name of “ oombretum is given to a plant that bears %0aa very strong resemblance to it, the leaves of which taper to %0athe fineness of threads; in height, however, it is taller than %0athe bacchar. These are the only The error, %0a%0ahowever, ought to be corrected, on the part of those who have %0abestowed upon the bacchar the name of “ field nard for that %0ain reality is the surname given to another plant, known to the %0aGreeks as “ asaron,” the description and features of which we %0ahave already mentioned, when speaking of the different va¬ %0arieties of nard. I fi.nd, too, that the name of “ asaron ” has %0abeen given to this plant, from the circumstance of its never %0abeing employed in the composition of chaplets, %0a%0aCUAP. 17.-SAFFROir : IN WHAT PLACES IT GROWS BEST. WHAT %0a%0aFLOWERS WERE KNOWN AT THE TIME OF THE TROJAN WAR. %0a%0aThe wUd saflfron is the best; indeed, in Italy it is of no %0a%0agloves. The only strong objection to this is the fact that the root of the %0adigitalis has a very faint but disagreeable smell, and not at all like that of %0acinnamon. But then, as Fee says, we have no positive proof that the %0a“cinnamomum” of the ancients is identical with our cinnamon. See Vol. %0aiii. p. 138. Sprengel takes the “ bacchar” of Virgil to be the Valeriana %0aCeltica, and the “ baccharis” of the Greeks to be the Gnaphalium san- %0aguineum, a plant of Egypt and Palestine. The bacchar has been also %0aidentified with the Asperula odorata of Linnaeus, the Geum urbanura of %0aLinnaeus (the root of which has the smell of cloves), the Inula Vaillantii, %0athe Salvia Sclarea, and many other plants. %0a%0a® “ Barbaricam.” Everything that was not indigenous to the territory %0aof Home, was “ barbarum,” or “ barbaricum.” %0a%0a® Caesalpinus says that this is a rushy plant, called, in Tuscan)', Herba %0aluziola; but Fee is quite at a loss for its identification. %0a%0aSillig is most probably right in his surmise that there is an hiatus %0a%0ahere. %0a%0a“ In B. xii. c. 27.

The cultivated saffron is %0alarger, finer, and better looking than the other kinds, but has %0amuch less efficacy. This plant is everywhere degenerating,'* %0aand is far from prolific at Cyrenae even, a place where the %0aflowers are always of the very finest quality. The most es¬ %0ateemed saffron, however, is that of Cilicia, and there of Mount %0aCorycus in particular; next comes the saffron of Mount Olym¬ %0apus, in Lycia, and then of Centuripa, in Sicily ; some persons, %0ahowever, have given the second rank to the Phlegraean '* saf- %0airon. %0a%0aThere is nothing so much adulterated’® as saffron : the best %0aproof of its goodness is when it snaps under pressure by the %0afingers, as though it were friable;’'' for when it is moist, a %0astate which it owes to being adulterated, it is limp, and will %0anot snap asunder. Another way of testing it, again, is to %0aapply it with the hand to the face, upon which, if good, it will %0abe found to be slightly caustic to the face and eyes. There is %0aa peculiar kind, too, of cultivated saffron, which is in general %0aextremely mild, being only of middling ’® quality ; the name %0agiven to it is “ dialeucon.”’® The saffron of Cyrenaica, again, %0ais faulty in the opposite extreme; for it is darker than any %0aother kind, and is apt to spoil very quickly. The best saffron %0aeverywhere is tliat which is of the most unctuous quality, and %0athe filaments of which are the shortest; the worst being that %0awhich emits a musty smell. %0a%0aMucianus informs us that in Lycia, at the end of seven or %0aeight years, the saffron is transplanted into a piece of ground %0awhich has been prepared for the purpose, and that in this way %0a%0a14 “Degenerans ubique.” Judging from what he states below, he may %0apossibly meau, if grown repeatedly on the same soil. %0a%0aHe may allude either to the city of Phlegra of Macedonia, or to the %0aPhlegraean Plains in Campania, which were remaj'kable for their fertility. %0aVirgil speaks of the saffron of Mount Tmolus in Cilicia. %0a%0aIt is very extensively adulterated tvith the petals of the marigold, as %0aalso the Cartbamus tinctorius, saflBower, or bastard saffron. %0a%0a” This is the case ; for when it is brittle it shows that it has not been %0aadulterated with water, to add to its weight. %0a%0aPerhaps the reading here, “ Cijm sit in medio candidum,” is prefer¬ %0aable ; “ because it is white in the middle.” , %0a%0a" White throughout.” %0a%0a%0aChap. 18.] %0a%0a%0aTHE NATURE OP ODOURS. %0a%0a%0a;2l %0a%0a%0ait is prevented from degenerating.

It is verdant** at %0athe time of the winter solstice, and then it is that they gather %0ait; it is usually dried in the shade, and if in winter, all the %0abetter. The root of this plant is fleshy, and more long-lived*^ %0athan that of the other bulbous plants. It loves to be beaten %0aand trodden *® under foot, and in fact, the wmrse it is treated %0athe better it thrives : hence it is, that it grows so vigorously %0aby the side of foot-paths and fountains.

Saffron was %0aalready held in high esteem in the time of the Trojan War; %0aat all events, Homer,*® we find, makes mention of these three %0aflowers, the lotus,** the saflfron, and the hyacinth. %0a%0aCHAP. 18.— THE NATURE OF ODOURS. %0a%0aAll the odoriferous*® substances, and consequently the plants, %0adiffer from one another in their colour, smell, and juices.

It was discharged through pipes of very minute %0abore, so that it fell upon the .spectators in the form of the finest dust. See %0aLucretius, 13. ii. 1. 416; Lucan, Phars. ix. 1. 808—810; and Seneca, Epist. %0a92. %0a%0aIt flowers so rapidly, in fact, that it is diiScult to avoid the loss of a %0apart of the harvest. %0a%0a** The whole of this passage ie from Theophrastus, De Odorib. %0a%0a^ This statement, though borrowed from Theophrastus, is not consis¬ %0atent with fact. The root of saffron is not more long-lived than any other %0abulbs of the Liliaceae. %0a%0a^ Because, Dalechamps says, all the juices are thereby thrown back into %0athe root, which consequently bears a stronger flower the next year. %0a%0a“ II. xiv. 1. 348. ** See B. xiii. c. 32. %0a%0aAll these statements as to the odours of various substances, are from %0aTheophrastus, De Causis, B. vi. c. 22. %0a%0aHe does not say, however, that it is but rarely that a bitter substance %0ais not odoriferous ; a sense in which Fee seems to have understood him, as %0ahe says, “ This assertion is not true in general, and there are numerous %0a%0aVOL.

Thus it is, too, that wine is more odorife¬ %0arous than must, and all the wild plants more so than the cul¬ %0ativated ones.^® Some flowers have a sweet smell at a distance, %0athe edge of which is taken off when they come nearer; such is %0athe case with the violet, for instance. The rose, when fresh %0agathered, has a more powerful smell at a distance, and dried,®* %0awhen brought nearer. All plants have a more penetrating %0aodour, also, in spring and in the morning; as the hour of %0amidday approaches, the scent becomes gradually weakened.®® %0aThe flowers, too, of young plants are less odoriferous than those %0aof old ones ;■ but it is at mid-age that the odour is most pene¬ %0atrating in them all. %0a%0aThe rose and the crocus have a more powerful smell when %0agathered in fine weather, and all plants are more powerfully %0ascented in hot climates than in cold ones. In Egypt, however, %0athe flowers are far from odoriferous, owing to the dews and %0aexhalations with which the air is charged, in consequence of %0athe extended surface of the river. Some plants have an agree¬ %0aable, though at the same time extremely powerful smell; some, %0aagain, while green, have no ®® smell at all, owing to the excess %0aof moisture, the buceros for example, which is the same as %0a%0aexceptions; for instance, quassia ■wood, which is inodorous and yet in¬ %0atensely bitter.” The essential oil, he remarks, elaborated in the tissue of %0athe corolla, is the ordinary source of the emanations of the flower. %0a%0a3® Fee remarks that cultivation gives to plants a softer and more aqueous %0aconsistency, which is consequently injurious to the developement of the %0aessential oil. %0a%0aTheophrastus, from whom this is borrowed, might have said witli %0amore justice, Fee remarks, that certain roses have more odour when dried %0athan when fresh gathered. Such is the case, he says, with the Provence %0arose. Fresh roses, however, have a more pronounced smell, the nearer %0athey are to the olfactory organs. %0a%0aThis is by no means invariably the case: in fact, the smell of most %0aodoriferous plants is most powerful in summer. %0a%0aBecause the essential oils evaporate more rapidly. %0a%0aWith Littre, we adopt the reading “relate,” “mid-age,” and %0anot “ aestate,” “ midsummer,” for although the assertion would be in %0ageneral correct, Pliny would contradict the statement just made, that %0aall plants have a more penetrating odour in spring. This reading is sup¬ %0aported also by the text of Theophrastus. %0a%0aOr saflfron. %0a%0aThis is a just observation, but the instances might be greatly ex¬ %0atended, as Fee says. %0a%0a%0aChap. 18.] %0a%0a%0aTHE NATUEE OF OBOUES. %0a%0a%0a■323 %0a%0a%0afenugreek.^’ Not all flowers which have a penetrating odour %0aare destitute of juices, the violet, the rose, and the crocus, for %0aexample ; those, on the other hand, which have a penetrating %0aodour, but are destitute of juices, have all of tliera a very pow¬ %0aerful smell, as we find the case with the two varieties®® of the %0alily. The abrotonum and the amaracus have a pungent %0asmell. In some plants, it is the flower only that is sweet, the %0aother parts being inodorous, the violet and the rose, for example . %0a%0aAmong the garden plants, the most odoriferous are the dry %0aones, such as rue, mint, and parsley, as also those which grow %0aon dry soils. Some fruits become more odoriferous the older %0athey are, the quince, for example, which has also a stronger %0asmell when gathered than while upon the tree. Some plants, %0aagain, have no smell but when broken asiinder, or when bruised, %0aand others only when they are stripped of their bark. Certain %0avegetable substances, too, only give out a smell when subjected %0ato the action of fire, such as frankincense and myrrh, for ex¬ %0aample. All flowers are more bitter to the taste when bruised %0athan when left untouched.^' Some plants preserve their smell %0aa longer time when dried, the melilote, for example; others, %0aagain, make the place itself more odoriferous where they grow, %0athe iris'*® for instance, which will even render the whole of a %0atree odoriferous, the roots of w^hich it may happen to have %0atouched. The hesperis has a more powerful odour at night, %0aa property to which it owes its name. %0a%0aAmong the animals, we find none that are odoriferous, un¬ %0aless, indeed, we are inclined to put faith in what has been said %0aabout the panther. %0a%0aSee B. xviii. c. 39. %0a%0aThe white lily and the red lily.

In the iris, it is the root " only that is held in esteem, %0ait being extensively employed in perfumery and medicine. The %0airis of the finest quality is that found in Illyricum,'*® and in %0athat country, eveu, not in the maritime parts of it, but in the %0aforests on the banks of the river Drilon" and near Narona. %0aThe next best is that of Macedonia,®® the plant being extremely %0aelongated, white, and thin. The iris of Africa®^ occupies the %0athird rank, being the largest of them all, and of an extremely %0abitter taste. %0a%0aThe iris of Illyricum comprehends two varieties—one of %0awhich is the raphanitis, so called from its resemblance to the %0aradish,®^ of a somewhat red colour, and superior ®® in quality to %0athe other, which is known as the “ rhizotomus.” The best %0akind of iris is that which produces sneezing ®* when handled. %0aThe stem of this plant is a cubit in length, and erect, the flower %0abeing of various colours, like the rainbow, to which circum¬ %0astance it is indebted for its name.

The ancient type of this plant, our iris, sword- %0alily, or flower-de-luce, was probably the Iris Florentina or Florentine iris %0aof modern botany. %0a%0aAt the present day, too, it is the root of the plant that is the most %0aimportant part of it. %0a%0a” The Iris Florentina, probably, of Linnaeus. %0a%0aMentioned by Nicander, Theriaca, 1. 43. %0a%0aProbably a variety only of the preceding kind. %0a%0aThe most common varieties in Africa are the Iris alata of Lamarck, %0aI.

It is a point particularly %0arecommended, that those who gather it should be in a state of %0achastity. The root, not only when dried,®’ but while still in %0athe ground, is very quickly attacked by worms. In former %0atimes, it was Leucas and Elis that supplied us with the best %0aoil “of iris, for there it has long been cultivated; at the present %0aday, however, the best comes from Pampbylia, though that of %0aCilicia and the northern climates is held in high esteem. %0a%0aCHAP. 20 . —THE SALIUNCA. %0a%0aThe saliunca has a rather short leaf, which does not admit %0aof its being plaited for garlands, and numerous roots, by which %0ait is held together; being more of a herb than a flower, and %0a80 closely matted and tangled that it would almost appear to %0ahave been pressed together with the hand—in short, it is a %0aturf “ of a peculiar nature.

The rival colours being now set side by side, Nature %0aand luxury may enter the lists, to vie for the mastery. %0a%0aI find it stated that, in the most ancient times, yellow was %0aheld in the highest esteem, but was reserved exclusively for %0athe nuptial veils'^^ of females; for which reason it is perhaps %0athat we do not find it included among the principal colours, %0athose being used in common by males and females: indeed, it %0ais the circumstance of their being used by both sexes in com¬ %0amon that gives them their rank as principal colours. %0a%0aCHAP. 23 . —THE AMARANTH. %0a%0aThere is no doubt that all the efforts of art are surpassed %0aby the amaranth,’® which is, to speak correctly, rather a purple %0aear’® than a flower, and, at the same time, quite inodorous. It is %0aa marvellous feature in this plant, that it takes a delight in being %0agathered ; indeed, the more it is plucked, the better it grows. %0aIt comes into flower in the month of August, and lasts through¬ %0aout the autumn. The finest of all is the amaranth of Alex¬ %0aandria, w'hich is generally gathered for keeping; for it is a %0areally marvellous” fact, that when all the other flowers have %0agone out, the amaranth, upon being dipped in water, comes to %0alife again : it is used also for making winter chaplets. The %0apeculiar quality of the amaranth is sufficiently indicated by %0aits name, it having been so called from the circumstance that %0ait never fades.’® %0a%0aBelonging, probably, Fee thinks, to the Cruciferae of the genera %0aHesperis and Cheiranthus. %0a%0a“ Flararaeis.” The “ flammeura,” or flame-coloured veil of the bride, %0awas of a bright yellow, or rather orange-colour, perhaps. %0a%0a’® The Celosia cristata of Linnaeus. %0a%0a’® “ Spica.” The moderns have been enabled to equal the velvety ap¬ %0apearance of the amaranth in the tints imparted by them to their velvets. %0aThe Italians call it the “ velvet-flower.” %0a%0a” The real fact is, that the amaranth, being naturally a dry flower, and %0ahaving little humidity to lose, keeps better than most others. %0a%0aFrom the Greek «, “ not,” and [lapdivtaOai, “ to fade.” %0a%0a%0a328 %0a%0a%0aPLIJrr’s NATUEAL HI8T0ET. %0a%0a%0a[Book XXL %0a%0a%0aCHAP. 24 .- THE CTANOS : THE H0L0CHETS03. %0a%0aThe name,” too, of the cyanos®® indicates its colour, and so %0adoes that of the holochrysos.®* None of these flowers were %0ain use in the time of Alexander the Great, for the authors, we %0afind, who flourished at a period immediately after his decease, %0ahave made not the slightest mention of them; from which %0acircumstance it is very clear that they only came into fashion %0aat a later period.

The petals of %0ait are small, and five in number ; and it is a remarkable cir¬ %0acumstance in this plant, that the head of it droops at first, and %0ait is only after it becomes erect that the petals make their ap¬ %0apearance, forming a small corolla of various colours, enclosing %0aa yellow seed. %0a%0aThe bellio,®® too, is a yellow flower, formed of®^ fifty-five %0afilaments circularly arranged, in the shape of a chaplet. These %0aare, both of them, meadow flowers, which are mostly of no use %0awhatever, and consequently without names : even the flowers %0ajust mentioned are known sometimes by one name, and some¬ %0atimes by another. %0a%0a’9 Being the Greek for “ blue” or “ azure.” %0a%0a80 The Centaurea cyanus of Linnajus; our blue-bell, %0a%0a81 Meaning “ all gold.” It has been identified with the Gnapbalium %0astoecbas of Liinnseus, the iminoTtelle of the French, which forms the ingre¬ %0adient for their funereal chaplets. %0a%0a82 Sprengel says that this is the Geum rivale of Linnaeus; but then the %0aGeum is a spring, and not an autumn flower, its blossoms bear no resem¬ %0ablance to those of the eglantine, and its seeds are not yellow. %0a%0a^ ^ Generally supposed to be the Chrysanthemum segetum, or golden %0a%0a8‘ “Pastillicantihus quinquagenis quinis barbulis coronatur.” Plinv is %0aunusually verbose here. %0a%0a%0aChap. 28.] %0a%0a%0aSHRUBS. %0a%0a%0a329 %0a%0a%0aCHAP. 26 . -THE CHRTSOCOME, OR CHEYSITTS. %0a%0a.The chrysocome,®® or chrysitis, has no Latin appellation : it %0ais a palm in height, the flowers forming clusters of a golden %0acolour.

Of such chaplets there are two kinds, one composed of %0aflowers, the other of leaves. The flowers so employed, I may %0asay, are those of broom®®—the j^ellow blossom gathered from %0ait—the rhododendron,®’ and the jujube,®® also known aS the %0atree of Cappadocia, which bears an odoriferous flower similar %0ato that of the olive.

The seed of thyme is so minute'® as to bo %0aimperceptible, and yet that of origanum, which is also ex¬ %0atremely minute, does not escape the sight. But what matters %0ait that Nature has thus concealed it from our view ? Por wo %0ahave reason to conclude that it exists in the flower itself; %0awhich, when sown in the ground, gives birth to the plant %0a—what is there, in fact, that the industry of man has left %0auntried ? %0a%0aThe honey of Attica is generally looked upon as the best in %0aall t''e world; for which reason it is that the thyme of that %0acountry has been transplanted, being reproduced, as already %0astated, with the greatest difficulty, from the blossom. But %0athere is also another peculiarity in the nature of the thyme of %0aAttica, which has greatly tended to frustrate these attempts— %0ait will never live except in the vicinity of breezes from the %0asea. In former times, it was the general belief that this is the %0acase with aU kinds of thyme, and that this is the reason why %0ait does not grow in Arcadia at a period when it was univer¬ %0asally supposed, too, that the olive never grows beyond three %0ahundred stadia'® from the sea.

Left to range at large, it reproduces %0aitself by layers from the tops of the branches : but when it is %0apropagated by the hand of man, it is better to grow it from %0athe seed than from the roots or slips, though even from the seed %0ait is not grown without considerable trouble.

B. vi. c. 7, who, when speaking of the abroto- %0anu.m, says, “ It is transplanted in earthen pots, in the way employed for %0athe gardens of Adonis,” these gardens being moveable parterres, laid out %0ain pots or vases.

He says that it grows in Gedrosia^* more %0aparticular!)^, and that it is taken up by the roots immediately %0aafter the vernal equinox, and dried in the moonlight for thirty %0adays; after which preparation it emits light by night. He %0astates also, that the Magi and the kings of Parthia em¬ %0aploy this plant in their ceremonies w^hen they make a vow to %0aperform an undertaking; that another name given to it is %0a“ chenomyche,” from the circumstance that, at the very %0asight of it, geese will manifest the greatest alarm ; and that by %0asome persons, again, it is known as the “ nyctalops,”''*'* from the %0alight Which it emits at a considerable distance by night. %0a%0aCHAP. 37 . —W'HEKE THE MELILOTE IS FOUNn. %0a%0aThe melilote^® is found growing everywhere, though that %0aof Attica is held in the highest esteem.

The cenanthe %0agrows in warm localities, and has exactly the smell of the vine %0awhen in blossom, to which circumstance it is indebted for %0aits name. %0a%0aThere are two fabulous stories attached to the hyacinth ;" %0aaccording to one of them, it bears the impress of the griefr® %0awhich Apollo felt for the youth whom he had so tenderly %0aloved; and we learn from the other, that it derives its name %0afrom the blood®® of Ajax, the veins being so arranged in the %0aflower as to form the Greek letters AI inscribed upon it. %0a%0aThe helichrysos has a flow'er resembling 'gold in appearance, %0aa small leaf, and a fine, slendei’, but hard, stem.

The iris,*’ %0aalso, blossoms in summer. All these flowers pass away, how¬ %0aever, and fade; upon which others assume their places in %0aautumn, a third kind of lily,*® for instance, saffron, and two %0avarieties of the orsinum*®—one of them inodorous and the other %0ascented—making their appearance, all of them, as soon as the %0afirst autumnal showers fall. %0a%0aThe garland-makers employ the flowers of the thorn®* even %0afor making chaplets; the tender shoots, too, of the white %0athorn are sometimes preserved as a choice morsel®’ to tempt %0athe palate. %0a%0aSuch is the succession of the summer flowers in the parts %0abeyond sea: in Italy, the violet is succeeded by the rose, the %0alily comes on while the rose is still in flower, the cyanus®' suc¬ %0aceeds the rose, and the amaranth the cyanus. As to the vin- %0a%0aTheophrastus, Hist. Plant. B. vi. c. 7, mentions the “ cerinthus” %0anext after the flower of Jove : Pliny seems to have taken it for a kind of %0alily. This flower has not been identified. %0a%0aSprengel takes this to be the Lavandula spica, or Lavender. %0a%0aHardouin identifies this with the Lychnis Chalcedonica, or Cross of %0aJerusalem, with which opinion Fee seems inclined to coincide. Other %0acommentators incline to the opinion that it is the Jasminum friiticans, a %0aplant in which, beyond its smell, there is nothing at all remarkable. The %0aexotic monocotyledon, known as the “ Pothos,” has no connection with %0athe plant here mentioned. %0a%0aThis, according to some, is the Lychnis Chalcedonica, the next being %0athe Jasminum fruticans. %0a%0aAs known to us, all the varieties of the iris blossom in spring. %0a%0a5* The purple lily.

It is the same as the “ apiastrum,” though Pliny has erroneously %0amade them distinct plants. %0a%0a69 “ Wax-flower.” The Cerinthe major of Linnaeus : the greater honey- %0awort. %0a%0a■■0 See B. xi. c. 8. On the contrary, Virgil says, Georg, iv. 1. 20, that %0aa wild olive-tree should be planted near the hives, to protect them with its %0ashade. Varro says also, De Re Rust. iii. 16, that the bee extracts honey %0afrom the olive-tree; but according to Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. ix. c. 64, %0ait is from the leaf, and not the flower of that tree that the honey is ex¬ %0atracted. %0a%0aSee B. XV. c. 31. Fee is inclined to doubt the correctness of the %0aassertion here made by Pliny. %0a%0a■* See B. xiv. c. 5. The remedies for the diseases of bees in modem %0atimes are of a very similar nature, but attention is equally paid to the %0aproper ventilatiou of the hives. %0a%0a%0aChap. 44.^ %0a%0a%0aPOISONEP HONEY. %0a%0a%0a341 %0a%0a%0aThere is a village, called Hostilia, on the banks of tbe river %0aPadus : the inhabitants of it, when food” fails the bees in their %0avicinity, place the hives in boats and convey them some five %0amiles up the river in the night. In the morning the bees go %0aforth to feed, and then return to the boats; their locality %0abeing changed from day to day, until at last, as the boats sink %0adeeper and deeper in the water, it is ascertained that the hives %0aare full, upon which they are taken home, and the honey is %0awithdrawn. %0a%0a(13.) In Spain, too, for the same purpose, they have the %0ahives carried from place to place on the backs of mules. %0a%0aCHAP. 44.— POISONED HONEY, AND THE REMEDIES TO BE EMPLOYED %0aBY THOSE WHO HAVE EATEN OF IT. %0a%0aIndeed, the food of bees is of the very greatest importance, %0aas it is owing to this that we meet with poisonous’* honey %0aeven. At Heraclia” in Pontus, the honey is extremely perni¬ %0acious in certain years, though it is the same bees that make %0ait at other times. Authors, however, have not informed us %0afrom W'hat flowers this honey is extracted ; we shall, therefore, %0atake this opportunity of stating what we have ascertained %0aupon the subject. %0a%0aThere is a certain plant which, from the circumstance that %0ait proves fatal to beasts of burden, and to goats in particular, %0ahas obtained the name of “ segolethron,” ” and the blossoms of %0a%0aThis plan is still adopted on the river Po, the ancient Padus, as also %0aat Beauce, in the south of France, where the hives are carried from place %0ato place upon carts. In the north of England it is the practice to carry %0athe hives to the moors in autumn. %0a%0a’* This has been doubted by Spielmann, but it is nevertheless the truth; %0athe nature of the susrar secreted by the glands of the nectary, being ana¬ %0alogous to that of the” plant wliich furnishes it. The honey gathered from %0aaconite in Switzerland has been known to produce vertigo and even deli¬ %0arium. Dr. Barton also gives a similar account of the effects of the poisonous %0ahoney collected from the Kalmia latifolia in Pennsylvania; and Geofifroi %0aSaint Hilaire says that, having eaten in Brazil some honey prepared by a %0awasp called “ lecheguana,” his life was put in very considerable danger %0athereby. Xenophon also speaks of the effects of the intoxicating or mad¬ %0adening honey upon some of the Ten Thousand in their retreat. %0a%0a” The rhododendrons and rose laurels.

Persons, when they have eaten of it, throw them¬ %0aselves on the ground to cool the body, which is bathed with a %0aprofuse perspiration. There are numerous remedies, of which %0awe shall have occasion to speak in a more appropriate place %0abut as it will be as well to mention some of them on the pre¬ %0asent occasion, by way of being provided for such insidious acci¬ %0adents, I will here state that old honied wine is good, mixed %0awith the finest honey and rue; salt meats, also, taken re¬ %0apeatedly in small quantities, and as often brought up again. %0a%0aIt is a well-known fact that dogs, after tasting the excre¬ %0ations of persons suffering from these attacks, have been at¬ %0atacked with similar symptoms, and have experienced the same %0akind of pains. %0a%0aStill, however, it is equally well ascertained, that honied %0awine prepared from this honey, when old, is altogether innoxi¬ %0aous ; and that there is nothing better than this honey, mixed %0awith costus,’® for softening the skin of females, or, combined %0awith aloes, for the treatment of bruises. %0a%0aCHAP. 45. -MADDENING HONEY. %0a%0aIn the country of the Sanni, in the same part of Pontus, %0athere is another kind of honey, which, from the madness it %0aproduces, has received the name of “maenomenon.”” This %0aevil effect is generally attributed to the flowers of the rhodo¬ %0adendron,®® with which the woods there abound; and that people, %0athough it pays a tribute to the Homans in wax, derives no %0aprofit whatever from its honey, in consequence of these dan¬ %0agerous properties. In Persis, too, and in Gmtulia, a district %0a%0aIn reality, there are no visible signs by which to detect that the honey %0ais poisonous. %0a%0aB-. xxix. c. 31. ’s See B. xii. c. 25. %0a%0aWawofitvov, “maddening.” %0a%0aThe aegolethron of the preceding Chapter, Fee thinks. If so, the %0aword rhododendron, he says, would apply to two plants, the Nerion oleander %0aor rose laurel (see B. xvi. c. 33), and the Khododendron Ponticum. %0a%0a%0aChap. 46.] HONEY THAT FLIES WILL NOT TOLXH. %0a%0a%0a343 %0a%0a%0aof Mauritania Caesariensis, bordering on the country of the %0aMassoDsyli, there are poisonous honeycombs found ; and some, %0atoo, only partly so,®^ one of the most insidious things that %0apossibly could happen, were it not that the livid colour of the %0ahoney gives timely notice of its noxious qualities. What can %0awe suppose to have possibly been the intention of Nature in %0athus laying these traps in our way, giving us honey that is %0apoisonous in some years and good in others, poisonous in some %0aparts of the combs and not in others, and that, too, the produce %0ain all cases of the self-same bees ? It was not enough, forsooth, %0ato have produced a substance in which poison might be admi¬ %0anistered without the sliglitest difficulty, but must she herself %0aadminister it as well in the honey, to fall in the way of so %0amany animated beings ? What, in fact, can have been her %0amotive, except to render mankind a little more cautious and %0asomewhat less greedy ? %0a%0aAnd has she not provided the very bees, too, with pointed %0aweapons, and those w'eapons poisoned to boot ? So it is, and %0aI shall, therefore, without delay, set forth the remedies to %0acounteract the effects of their stings. It will be found a very %0aexcellent plan to foment the part stung with the juice of mal¬ %0alows®* or of ivy leaves, or else for the person who has been stuug %0ato take these juices in drink. It is a verj^ astonishing thing, %0ahowever, that the insects which thus carry these poisons in %0atheir mouths and secrete them, should never die themselves %0ain consequence; unless it is that Nature, that mistress of all %0athings, has given to bees the same immunity from the eflects %0aof poison w'hich she has granted against the attacks of serpents %0ato the Psylli®® and the Marsi among men. %0a%0aCHAP. 46. (14.)- HONEY THAT FLIES WILL NOT TOUCH. %0a%0aAnother marvellous fact, again, connected with honey in %0aCrete. Upon Mount Carma in that island, which is nine %0amiles in circuit, there is not a fly to be found, and the honey %0athat is made there no fly will touch.®^ It is by this ciroum- %0a%0aFee refuses to credit this ; but still such a thing might accidentally %0ahappen. %0a%0a« These asserted remedies would be of no use whatever.

The best hives are %0athose made of bark, the next best those of fennel-giant, and the %0anext of osier: many persons, too, have them made of mirror- %0astone,®® for the purpose of watching®^ the bees at work within. %0aIt is the best plan to anoint the hives all over with cow-dung. %0aThe lid of the hive should be made to slide from behind, so as %0ato admit of being shut to within, in case the hive should prove %0atoo large or their labours unproductive; for, if this is not %0adone, the bees are apt to become discouraged and abandon %0atheir work. The slide may then be gradually withdrawn, the %0aincrease of space being imperceptible to the bees as the work %0aprogresses. In winter, too, the hives should be covered with %0astraw, and subjected to repeated fumigations, with burnt cow- %0adung more particularly. As this is of kindred®® origin with %0athe bees, the smoke produced by it is particularly beneficial in %0akilling all such insects as may happen to breed there, such as %0aspiders, for instance, moths,®® and wood-worms ;®® while, at the %0asame time, it stimulates the bees themselves to increased acti¬ %0avity. In fact, there is little difficulty in getting rid of the %0aspiders, but to destroy the moths, which are a much greater %0aplague, a night must be chosen in spring, just when the mal¬ %0alow is ripening, there being no moon, but a clear sky: fiam- %0abeaux are then lighted before the hives, upon which the moths %0aprecipitate themselves in swarms into the flame. %0a%0aF^e remarks here that Pliny is right, and that Columella and Palla- %0adius are wrong, who would have the hives to look due north. %0a%0aLapis specularis ; a sort of talc, probably.

In certain summers, too, when long-con¬ %0atinued drought has deprived them of the nutriment which %0athey usually derive from flowers, similar food must be pro¬ %0avided for them. %0a%0aWhen the honey is taken, the outlets of the hive should be %0awell nibbed with melissophyllum or broom,®^ beaten up, or else %0athe middle of it should be encircled with bands of white vine, %0ato prevent the bees from taking to flight. It is recommended, %0atoo, that the hone 5 "-pots and combs should be washed with %0awater: this water, boiled, it is said, will make an extremely %0awdiolesome vinegar.®® %0a%0a%0aCHAP. 49. —THE METHOD OF PEEPAEING WAX. THE BEST KINDS %0aOF WAX. PUNIC WAX. %0a%0a%0aWax is made®® from the honeycombs after the honey has %0abeen extracted. For this purpose, they are first cleaned with %0awater, and then dried three days in the shade : on the fourth %0aday they are melted on the fire in a new earthen vessel, with %0asufficient water to cover them, after which the liquor is strained %0aoff in a wdcker basket.®’ The wax is then boiled again with %0athe same water and in the same pot, and poured into vessels of %0acold water, the interior of which has been well rubbed with %0ahoney. The best wax is that known as Punic®® wax, the next %0abest being that of a remarkably yellow colour, with the smell %0aof honey. This last comes from Pontus, and, to my surprise, %0ait is in no way affected by the poisonous honey which it has %0aHoneycombs and rough wax are placed in the hive, when the bees %0aare in want of aliment; also honey and sugar-sirop. %0a%0a9- “Defrutum:” grape-juice boiled down to one-halt. %0a%0a93 Fee is at a loss to know how this could be of any service as an ali¬ %0a%0a%0ament to bees. %0a%0a»‘ A mere puerility, Fee says. , , , %0a%0a95 But extremely weak, no doubt; for after boiling, the hydromel must %0abe subjected, first to vinous, and then to acetous, fermentation. %0a%0a95 The method here described difters but little from that employed at %0a%0a%0athe present day. %0a9’ “ Sporta.” %0a%0a%0a9« Or Carthaginian. %0a%0a%0a346 %0a%0a%0aflint’s natural history. %0a%0a%0a[Rook XX r. %0a%0a%0acontained.®® The next in quality is the Cretan wax, which %0acontains the largest proportion of propolis,^ a substance of %0awhich we have previously made mention when treating of %0abees. Next to these varieties comes the Corsican wax, which, %0abeing the produce of the box-tree, is generally thought to bo %0apossessed of certain medicinal properties. %0a%0aThe Punic wax is prepared in the following manner : yellow %0awax is first blanched in the open air, after which it is boiled %0ain water from the open sea, with the addition of some nitre.® %0aThe fiower of the wax, or, in other words, the whitest part of %0ait, is then skimmed off with spoons, and poured into a vessel %0acontaining a little cold water. After this, it is again boiled %0ain sea-water by itself, which done, the vessel is left to cool. %0aWhen this operation has been three times repeated, the wax is %0aleft in the open air upon a mat of rushes, to dry in the light of %0athe sun and moon; for while the latter adds to its whiteness, %0athe sun helps to dry® it. In order, however, that it may not %0amelt, it is the practice to cover it with a linen cloth : if, when %0ait has been thus refined, it is boiled once more, the result is a %0awax of the greatest possible whiteness. %0a%0aPunic wax is considered the best for all medicinal prepara¬ %0ations. Wax is made black by the addition of ashes of pa¬ %0apyrus, and a red colour is given to it by the admixture of al- %0akanet; indeed, by the employment of various pigments, it is %0amade to assume various tints, in which state it is used for %0amaking models,and for other purposes without number, %0aamong which we may mention varnishing walls® and armour, %0ato protect them from the air. We have given the other par¬ %0aticulars relative to bees and honey, when speaking® of the %0anature of those insects. We have now stated pretty nearly %0aall that we have to say on the subject of the pleasure garden. %0a%0aIn reality, the wax has properties totally different from those of the %0ahoney, and it is not always gathered from the same plants. %0a%0a1 A kind of hee-glue.

XV. c. 28. %0a%0a® See B. xxiii. c. 17. According to some authorities, it is supposed to %0abe the Delphinium staphis agria of Linnmus; but Fee and Desfontaines %0aidentify it with the Tamus communis of Linnseus, Our Lady’s seal. %0a%0a® The Ruscus aculeatus of Linnaeus. See B. xxiii. c. 83. %0a%0a*® In B. xxiL c. 33, this plant is called “ halimon.” Some authors %0aidentify it with the Atriplex halymus, and others, again, with the Crithmum %0amaritimum of Linnaeus. See also B. xxvi. c. 50. %0a%0a“ Identified by some commentators with the Portulaca sativa or Portu- %0alaca oleracea of Linnaeus. %0a%0a** “ Pastinaca pratensis.” Fee and Desfontaines are undecided whether %0athis is the Daucus caroti of Linnaeus, the common carrot, or the Pastinaca %0asativa, the cultivated parsnip. %0a%0a“ Lupus salictarius,” the “ willow wolf,” literally; the Humulus %0alupulus of Linnmus. It probably took its Latin name rrora the tenacity %0awith which it clung to willows and osiers. %0a%0aThe Arum colocasia of Linnaeus. %0a%0aThe “bean.” Not, however, the Egyptian bean, which is the Nym- %0aphaea nelumbo of Linna;us, the Nelumbum speciosum of Willdenow. %0a%0a%0a348 %0a%0a%0aPliny’s natueal nisTOET. %0a%0a%0a[Book XXI- %0a%0a%0aseparates'® into fine filaments when chewed, like those of the %0aspider’s web.

The other variety** %0ais more prickly, and has a more sinewy stem, which may be %0asaid almost to creep upon the ground; the seed is small.

There is one kind %0aalso, which emits a smell, known as the Herculanean” nettle. %0aThe seed of all the nettles is copious, and black. It is a sin¬ %0agular fact that, though possessed of no spinous points, the %0adown®® of the nettle is of a noxious nature, and that, though %0aever so lightly touched, it will immediately produce an itch¬ %0aing sensation, and raise a blister on the flesh similar in ap« %0apearance to a burn : the well-known remedy for it is olive oil. %0a%0aThe stinging property of the nettle does not belong to the %0aplant at the earliest period of its growth, but only developes %0aitself under the influence of the sun. The plant first begins %0ato grow in the spring, at which period it is by no means a %0adisagreeable food indeed, it has become quite a religious ob¬ %0aservance to employ it as such, under the impression that it is %0aa preventive from diseases the whole year through. The root, %0atoo, of the wild nettle, has the effect of rendering all meat %0amore tender that is boiled withit.®® The kind that is innoxious %0aand destitute of all stinging properties, is known as the “ la- %0amium.” Of the scorpio®* we shall have occasion to speak %0awhen treating of the medicinal plants. %0a%0athe exception of the TJrtica pilifera, which has the most stin^ng proper¬ %0aties of all those found in Europe, and the leaves of which are the most %0adeeply indented. %0a%0aThis has not been identified. They are all of them either inodorous, %0aor else possessed of a faint, disagreeable smell. %0a%0aThis “ lanugo,” or down, as he calls it, consists of a fine elongated %0atube of cellular tissue, seated upon a gland of similar tissue. In this %0agland a poisonous fluid is secreted, and when any pressure is made upon %0athe gland, the fluid passes upwards in the tube. The nettle of the East, %0aknown as the Devil’s Leaf, is of so poisonous a quality as to produce %0adeath. %0a%0aIn some parts of the north of England and of Scotland the young %0aplant of the Urtica dioica is eaten as greens, and is far from a disagreeable %0adish, strongly resembling spinach. It is also reckoned a very wholesome %0adiet, and is taken habitually in the spring, under the impression that it %0apurifies the blood. This notion, we see from the context, is as old as the %0atime of the Eomans. %0a%0aDalechamps speaks of it as the custom in his time to wrap up fish %0aand game in nettles, under the impression that they would keep the longer %0afor it. %0a%0aThe dead nettle, or blind nettle.

I’he bulbs %0aof it are like moderately-sized turnips, and there is no plant %0athe root of which has more of them, as many as eighty bulbs %0abeing often grouped together. Theophrastus, and nearly all %0athe Greek writers, with Pythagoras at the head of them, have %0agiven the name of “ anthericos ” to its stem, which is one cubit, %0aand often two, in length, the leaves being very similar to those %0aof the wild leek ; it is to the root, or in other words, the bulbs, %0athat they have given the name of asphodel. The people of our %0acountry call this plant “ albucus,” and they give the name %0aof “ royal spear ” to the asphodel the stem of which bears %0aberries,^® thus distinguishing two varieties of it. The albu- %0acus has a stalk a cubit in length, large, naked, and smooth, in %0areference to which, Mago recommends that it should be cut at %0athe end of March and the beginning of April, the period at %0awhich it blossoms, and before the seed has begun to swell; he %0asays, too, that the stalks should be split, and exposed on the %0afourth day in the sun, after which, when dry, they should be %0amade up into bundles. %0a%0aThe same author states, also, that the Greeks give the name %0aof “pistana” to the aquatic plant known to us as the “ sa- %0agitta and he recommends that it should be stripped of its %0abark, and dried in a mild sun, between the ides of May®^ and %0athe end of October. He says, too, that it is usual to cut down %0ato the root, throughout all the month of July, the variety of %0athe gladiolus called “cypiros,” which is a marsh-plant also, %0aand at the end of three days to dry it in the sun, until it turns %0awhite; but that care must be taken ever)' day to carry it under %0acover before sunset, the night dews being very injurious to %0amarsh plants when cut. %0a%0aOd. xi. 539, and xxiv. 13. %0a%0aIt is difficult to say to what “ illud” refers, if, indeed, it is the correct %0areading. %0a%0a“ Hastula regia.” 28 « Caulis acinosi.” %0a%0a23 See B. xxii. c. 32. %0a%0a8 ® “Arrow.” The Sagittaria sagittifolia of Linna 5 us; our arrow-head, %0aor adder’s tongue. 3 i 15 th of May. %0a%0a%0aChap. 09.] THE BUSH. 301 %0a%0aCBAP. 69.

He describes a second kind, also, which I find is %0agenerally called the “ marine" rush, and is known to the %0aGreeks as the “ oxyschcenos.”®^ %0a%0aGenerally speaking, there are three varieties of this last %0arush: the pointed rush, which is barren, and by the Greeks %0ais called the male rush and the “ oxys the female rush,®® %0awhich bears a black seed, and is called the “ melancranis,”*’ %0athicker and more bushy than the preceding one : and a third %0akind, called the “ holoschoenus,”®® which is larger still. Of %0athese varieties, the melancranis grows separately from the %0aothers, but the oxys and the holoschoenus will grow upon the %0aself-same clod. The holoschoenus is the most useful for all %0akinds of basket-work, being of a particularly supple and fleshy %0anature; it bears a fruit, which resembles eggs attached to one %0aanother. The rush, again, which we have spoken of as the %0amale rush,®® is reproduced from itself, the summit of it being %0abent down into the earth ; the melancranis, however, is propa¬ %0agated from seed.

The cypiros of Crete is %0awhite, with an odour strongly resembling that of nard; tlie %0aproduce of Naxos has a more pungent smell, that of Phoenicia %0abut little odour of any kind, and that of JEg}q;)t none at all; %0afor it grows in that country as well. %0a%0aThis plant disperses hard tumours of the body—for we shall %0ahere begin to speak of the remedies derived from the various %0aflowers and odoriferous plants, they being, all of them, of very %0aconsiderable utility in medicine. As to the cypiros, then, I %0ashall follow Apollodorus, who forbids it to be taken in drink, %0athough at the same time he admits that it is extremely useful %0afor calculi of the bladder, and recommends it in fomentations %0afor the face. He entertains no doubt, however, that it is pro¬ %0aductive of abortion, and he mentions, as a remarkable fact, %0athat the barbarians,^^ by inhaling the fumes of this plant at %0athe mouth, thereby diminish the volume of the spleen.

THE CTPERIS. %0a%0aTHE CYPIRA. %0a%0a/ The cyperos, as we have just stated, is a rush of angular shape, %0awhite near the ground, and black and solid at the top. The %0alower leaves are more slender than those of the leek, and those %0aat the top are small, with the seed of the plant lying betAveen %0athem. The root resembles a black olive,"*® and when it is of %0aan oblong shape, the plant is known as the “ cyperis,”"*® being %0aemployed in medicine to a great extent. The cyperos most %0ahighly esteemed is that of the vicinity of the Temple of Jupi¬ %0ater Hammon, the next best being that of Rhodes, the next %0athat of Therse, and the worst of all that of Egypt, a circumstance %0aAvhich tends greatly to add to the misunderstanding on the %0asubject, as that country produces the cypiros as well: but the %0acypiros which grows there is extremely hard, and has hardly %0aany smell at all, while all the other varieties of it have an %0aodour strongly resembling that of nard. %0a%0aThere is jdso an Indian plant, called the “cypira,”"*® of a %0atotally different character, and similar to ginger in appearance; %0awhen chewed, it has exactly the flavour of saffron. %0a%0aThe cyperos, emploj^ed medicinally, is possessed of certain %0adepilatory properties. It is used in liniments for hang-nails %0aand ulcerous sores of the genitals and of all parts of the body %0awhich are of a humid nature, ulcers of the mouth, for instance. %0aThe root of it is a very efficacious remedy for the stings of ser¬ %0apents and scorpions.

This rush is round, and when applied to the tongue, %0ahas a pungent, vinous flavour. The genuine kind, when %0arubbed, gives out an odour like that of the rose, and when %0abroken asunder it is red within. It dispels flatulency, and %0ahence it is very good for the stomach, and for persons when %0avomiting the bile or blood. It arrests hiccup also, promotes %0aeructations, acts as a diuretic, and is curative of afiections of %0athe bladder. A decoction of it is used for female complaints; %0aand in cases of opisthotony, it is applied in plasters with dry %0aresin, these being highly valued for their warming properties. %0a%0aCHAP. 73. —REMEDIES DERIVED FROM THE FLOWERS BEFORE MEN¬ %0aTIONED : THIRTY-TWO REMEDIES DERIVED FROM THE ROSE. %0a%0aThe rose is of an astringent and refreshing nature.

Those portions of the petals which are quite white are %0aknown as the unglets.®^ In the flower there is the seed, as %0adistinguished from the filaments, and in the head there is the %0abud,“ as well as the calyx. The petals are dried, or else the %0ajuice is extracted from them, by one of the three following %0amethods: Either the leaves are employed whole for the pur¬ %0apose, the unglets not being removed—for these are the parts, %0ain fact, that contain the most juice—or else the unglets are %0afirst taken ofi" and the residue is then macerated with oil or %0awine, in glass vessels placed in the sun. Some persons add %0asalt as well, and others alkanet,®^ or else aspalathus or sweet- %0ascented rush ; as it is, when thus prepared, a veiy valuable re¬ %0amedy for diseases of the uterus and for dysentery. According %0ato the third process, the unglets are removed from the petals, %0aand pounded, after which they are subjected to pressure in a %0acoarse linen cloth, the juice being received in a copper vessel.; %0ait is then boiled on a slow fire, until it has acquired the con¬ %0asistence of honey; for this purpose, however, the most odori¬ %0aferous of the petals should be selected. %0a%0a(19.) We have already stated,®^ when speaking of the va¬ %0arious kinds of wines, how rose wine is made. Hose juice is %0amuch used in injections for the ears, and as a gargle for ulcer¬ %0aations of the mouth, and for the gums and tonsils; it is em¬ %0aployed also for the stomach, maladies of the uterus, diseases %0aof the rectum, and for head-ache. In fevers, it is used, either %0aby itself or in combination with vinegar, as a remedy for %0asleeplessness and nausea. The petals, charred, are used, as a %0acosmetic for the eyebrows and the thighs, when chafed, are %0arubbed with them dried; reduced to powder, too, they are %0asoothing for defiuxions of the eyes. The fiower of the rose is %0asoporific, and taken in oxycrate it arrests fluxes in females, %0athe white flux in particular ; also spitting of blood, and pains %0ain the stomach, if taken in three cyathi of wine, in sufficient %0aquantity to flavour it. %0a%0aAs to the seed of the rose, the best is that which is of a saf¬ %0afron colour, and not more than a year old ; it should be dried, %0a%0a52 “Ungues,” “nails;” in allusion to the white part of the finger¬ %0anails. “ Cortex.” %0a%0a55 “Anchusam.” ®® In B. xiv. c. 19. %0a%0a55 “ In calliblepharum.” %0a%0a%0a3G6 %0a%0a%0aplixy’s natural history. %0a%0a%0a[Book XXI. %0a%0a%0atoo, in tlie shade. The black seed is worthless. In cases of %0atootli-ache, the seed is employed in the form of a liniment; it %0aacts also as a diuretic, and is used as a topical application for %0athe stomach, as also in cases of erysipelas which are not in¬ %0aveterate : inhaled at the nostrils, it has the effect of clearing %0athe brain. The lieads of roses, taken in drink, arrest looseness of %0athe bowels and hsemorrhage. The unglets of the rose are %0awholesome in cases of defluxion of the eyes; hut the rose is %0avery apt to taint all ulcerous sores of the eyes, if it is not ap¬ %0aplied at the very beginning of the defluxion, dried, and in %0acombination with bread. The petals, too, taken internally, aro %0aextremely wholesome for gna^sdng pains of the stomach, and %0afor maladies of the abdomen or intestines ; as also for the tho¬ %0aracic organs, if applied externally even: they are preserved, too, %0afor eating, in a similar manner to lapathum. Great care must %0abe taken in drying rose-leaves, as they are apt to turn mouldy %0avery quickly. %0a%0aThe petals, too, from which the juice has been extracted, %0amay be put to some use when dried : powders,®^ for instance, %0amay be made from them, for the piu’pose of cheeking the per¬ %0aspiration.

The roots of %0aboth kinds of narcissus have a flavour resembling that of wine %0amixed with honey. This plant is very useful, applied to %0aburns w'ith a liltle honey, as also to other kinds of wounds, %0aand sprains. Applied topically, too, with honey and oatmeal, %0ait is good for tumours, and it is similarly employed for the %0aextraction of foreign substances from the body. %0a%0aBeaten up in polenta and oil it effects the cure of contu¬ %0asions and blows inflicted by stones ; and, mixed with meal. %0a%0aOr “ Poley.” See c. 21 of this Book. %0a%0a61 “Mel.” ®^ See c. 12 of this Book. %0a%0aThe Narcissus pseudo-narcissus of Linnaeus, the meadow narcissus, %0aor daffodil.

Violets, in particular, %0aare used for defluxions of the eyes, prolapsus of the fundament %0aand uterus, and suppurations. Worn in chaplets upon the %0ahead, or even smelt at, they dispel the fumes of wine and head- %0aacl\e ; and, taken in water, they are a cure for quinsy. The %0apurple violet, taken in water, is a remedy for epilepsy, in %0achildren more particularl}?^; violet seed is good for the stings %0aof scorpions. %0a%0aOn the other hand, the flower of the white violet opens sup¬ %0apurations, and the plant itself disperses them. Both the white %0aand the yellow violet check the menstrual discharge, and act %0aas diuretics. When fresh gathered, they have less virtue, and %0ahence it is that they are mostly used dry, after being kept a %0ayear. The yellow violet, taken in doses of half a cyathus to %0athree cyathi of water, promotes the catamenia; and the roots %0aof it, applied with vinegar, assuage affections of the spleen, as %0aalso the gout. Mixed with myrrh and safitron, they are good %0afor inflammation of the eyes.

Applied with egg it disperses all kinds of inflamma¬ %0ation, those of the eyes in particular : it is employed also for %0ahysterical suffocations, and for ulcerations of the stomach, chest, %0akidneys, liver, lungs, and bladder. It is particularly useful %0aalso in cases of inflammation of those parts, and for cough and %0apleurisy. It likewise removes itching’® sensations, and acts as %0aa diuretic. Persons who have used the precaution of first %0ataking saffron in drink will never experience surfeit or head¬ %0aache, and will be proof against inebriation.

The other pro¬ %0aperties of it differ but very little from those of honey. It %0acleanses ulcerous sores of the head, and inveterate abscesses %0amore particularly. Taken in doses of two drachmae with honey, %0ait relaxes the bowels; and an infusion of it is good for cough, %0agripings of the stomach, and flatulency : taken with vinegar, %0atoo, it cures affections of the spleen. Mixed with oxycrate it %0ais good for the bites of serpents and spiders, and, in doses of %0atwo drachmae with bread or water, it is employed for the cure %0aof the stings of scorpions. It is applied also topically with oil %0ato the bites of dogs, and to parts that are excoriated: employed %0ain a similar manner, too, it is good for pains in the sinews, and %0ain combination with resin it is used as a liniment for lumbago %0aand sciatica.

Celebrated authors, %0atoo, I find, have asserted that twenty-five grains of the seed of %0athe kind of trefoil which we have®® spoken of as the “ minyan- %0athes,” are a sufficient antidote for all kinds of poisons; in ad¬ %0adition to which, there are numerous other remedial virtues %0aascribed to it. %0a%0aBut these notions, in my opinion, are counterbalanced by %0athe authority of a writer of the very highest repute : for wc %0afind the poet Sophocles asserting that the trefoil is a venomous %0aplant. Simus, too, the physician, maintains that a decoction %0aof it, or the juice, poured upon the human body, is productive %0aof burning sensations similar to those experienced by persons %0awhen they have been stung by a serpent and have trefoil ap- %0aphed to the wound. It is my opinion, then, that trefoil should %0anever be used in any other capacity than as a counter-poison; %0afor it is not improbable that the venom of this plant has a %0anatural antipathy to all other kinds of poisons, a phaenomenon %0awhich has been observed in many other cases as well.

Still, %0ahowever, these plants must be used in moderation, as they are %0aof a heating nature, for which reason it is that they act so %0aastringently upon the bowels. In cases of ulceration of the %0aintestines, the dose should be one denarius of thyme to one %0asextarius of oxymel; the same proportions, too, should be taken %0afor pains in the sides, between the shoulder-blades, or in the %0athoracic organs. Taken Avith oxymel, these plants are used for %0athe cure of intestinal diseases, and a similar draught is admin¬ %0aistered in cases of alienation of the senses and melancholy. %0a%0aThyme is given also for epilepsy, when the fits come on, the %0asmell of it reviving the patient; it is said, too, that epileptic %0apersons should sleep upon soft thyme.

Besides this, it is generally %0asupposed that the use of it confers additional graces on the %0aperson, and ensures universal attraction. They say, too, that, %0ataken with wine, it promotes gaiety of spirit, having, in fact, a %0asimilar effect to the nepenthes, which has been so much vaunted %0aby Homer,®® as producing forgetfulness of all sorrow. The %0ajuice of this plant is remarkably sweet, and the root of it, taken %0afasting in water, is'good for hardness of breathing; it is white %0awithin, and sweet.

They are both of them %0abitter, like wormwood. That of Sicily is the most esteemed, %0aand next to it, that of Galatia. The leaves of it are sometimes %0aemployed, but it is the seed that possesses the most warming %0a%0aOd. iv. 1. 221. This has been supposed by many commentators to %0ahave been opium. The origin of the word is vrj, “ not,” and irtp9og, %0a“giief;” and, as Fee says, it would seem to indicate rather a composition %0athan a plant. Saffron, mandragore, nightshade, and even tea and coffee, %0ahave been suggested by the active imaginations of various writers. Fee is %0aof opinion that it is impossible to come to any satisfactory conclusion, but %0ainclines to the belief that either the poppy or a preparation from it, is %0ameant. In confirmation of this opinion, it is a singular fact, that, as Dr. %0aParis remarks (in his Pharmacologia), the Nepenthes of Homer was ob¬ %0atained from Thebes in Egypt, and that tincture of opium, or laudanum, %0ahas received the name of “Thebaic tincture.” Gorraeus, in his “ Defini- %0ationes Medic®,” thinks that the herb alluded to is the Inula Campania, %0aor Elceampane, which was also said to have derived its name of %0a“ Heleniuni” from Helen. Dr. Greenhill, in Smith’s Dictionary of An¬ %0atiquities, inclines to the opinion that it was opium. See the article %0a“ Pharmaceutica.” %0a%0a1 See c. 34 of this Book. Both of the plants mentioned share the me¬ %0adicinal properties of wormwood, being stimulants, tonics, anthelmintics, %0aand febrifuges. It would be dangerous, however.

It keeps away serpents, and for %0atheir stings it is either taken in wine, or else employed in %0acombination with it as a liniment. It is extremely eflBcacious, %0aalso, for the stings of those noxious insects by which shivering %0afits and chills are produced, such as the scorpion and the spider %0acalled “ phalangium,”® for example; taken in a potion, it is %0agood for other kinds of poison, as also for shivering fits, how¬ %0aever produced, and for the extraction of foreign substances ad¬ %0ahering to the flesh; it has the effect, also, of expelling intes¬ %0atinal worms.

Some persons give the %0aname of “ phrenion” to this plant: there are two species of %0ait; one of which is wild,^ and the other grows on cultivated® %0aspots; though they are, both of them, attached to a sandy %0asoil. Of the cultivated anemone there are numerous varieties ; %0asome, and these are the most abundant, have a scarlet flower, %0awhile others, again, have a flower that is purple or else milk- %0awhite. The leaves of all these three kinds bear a strong re¬ %0asemblance to parsley, and it is not often that they exceed half %0aa foot in height, the head being very similar to that of aspa¬ %0aragus. The flower never opens, except while the wind is %0ablowing, a circumstance to which it owes its name.® The wild %0aanemone is larger than the cultivated one, and has broader %0aleaves, with a scarlet flower. %0a%0aSome persons erroneously take the wild anemone to be the %0asame as the argemone,*® while others, again, identify it with %0athe poppy which we have mentioned^ under the name of %0a“rhoeas:” there is, however, a great difference between them, %0aas these two other plants blossom later than the anemone, nor %0adoes the anemone possess a juice or a calyx like theirs; besides %0awhich, it terminates in a head like that of asparagus. %0a%0aThe various kinds of anemone are good for pains and in¬ %0aflammations of the head, diseases of the uterus, and stoppage %0aof the milk in females ; taken, too, in a ptisan, or applied as a %0apessary in wool, they promote the menstrual discharge.

A decoction of it, in ashes, with a sprinkUng of %0awine, has the effect of drying tumours : the juice, too, is em¬ %0aployed as a remedy for diseases of the ears. Applied to the %0aregions of the stomach, this plant is said to be remarkably %0agood for diarrhoea. %0a%0aCHAP. 100. -THREE REMEDIES DERIVED FROM BDTCHEr’s BROOM. %0a%0aA decoction of the root of butcher’s broom“ is recommended to %0abe taken every other day for calculus in the bladder, strangury, %0aand bloody urine. The root, however, should be taken up %0aone day, and boiled the next, the proportion of it being one %0asextarius to two cyathi of wine. Some persons beat up the %0aroot raw, and take it in water; it is generally considered, too, %0athat there is nothing in existence more beneficial to the male %0aorgans than the young stalks of the plant, beaten up and used %0awith vinegar.

This plant would be the same thing as %0aocimum, were it not that the leaves and branches of it are %0arougher, and that it has a powerful smell.

The other kind is taken %0ain drink, with oxymel, in doses of four drachmae, for indura¬ %0ations of the uterus, gripings of the bowels, and epilepsy. %0a%0aCHAP. 104.

With the decoction of %0ait, fomentations are made for maladies of the fundament, and %0afor inflammations and indurations of the uterus: dried and %0aapplied with honey and vinegar, it carries off black bile, for %0awhich reason it is considered good for vertigo and calculus in %0athe bladder. It is employed as a liniment, also, for erysipe¬ %0alas, and, mixed with stale axle-grease, for scrofulous sores. %0aFor tertian fevers the Magi recommend that it should be %0ataken up with the left hand, it being mentioned at the time %0afor whom it is gathered, care being also taken not to look back %0a%0a“ The C 3 rperus esculentus of Linnieus, the esculent souchet. %0a%0aThe two varieties are identified with the Cressa Cretica and the %0aTeucrium iva of Linnaeus.

One %0aof these kinds, bearing scarlet berries with a stone, enclosed %0ain follicules, is by some persons called the “halicacabum,”^" by %0aothers the “ callion,” and by the people of our country, the %0a“ vesicaria,” from the circumstance of its being highly bene¬ %0aficial to the bladder^^ and in cases of calculus. %0a%0aThe trychnon is more of a woody shrub than a herb, with %0alarge follicules, broad and turbinated, and a large berry within, %0awhich ripens in the month of November. A thirdkind, %0aagain, has a leaf resembling that of ocimum—but it is not my %0aintention to give an exact description of it, as I am here speak¬ %0aing of remedies, and not of poisons; for a few drops of the %0ajuice, in fact, are quite sufficient to produce insanity. The %0aGreek writers, however, have even turned this property into %0amatter for jesting; for, according to them, taken in doses of %0aone drachma, this plant is productive of delusive and prurient %0afancies, and of vain, fantastic visions, which vividly present all %0athe appearance of reality: they say, too, that if the dose is %0adoubled, it will produce downright madness, and that any fur¬ %0ather addition to it, will result in instant death. %0a%0aThis is the same plant which the more well-meaning writem %0ahave called in their innocence “ dorycnion,”^® from the circum¬ %0astance that weapons used in battle are poisoned with it—for it %0agrows everywhere—while others, again, who have treated of it %0a%0aThe Solamim nigrum of Linnmus, or black night-shade.

With a wonder¬ %0aful obliviousness of remedies really harmless, they tell us, for¬ %0asooth, that it is an instantaneous remedy for loose teeth to %0arinse them with halicacabuin steeped in wine : but at the same %0atime they add the qualification that it must not be kept in the %0amouth too long, or else delirium will be the result. This, how¬ %0aever, is pointing out remedies W'ith a vengeance, the employ¬ %0ament of which will be attended with worse results than the %0amalady itself. %0a%0aThere is a third kind^® of halicacahum, that is esteemed as an %0aarticle of food ; but even though the flavour of it may be pre¬ %0aferred to garden plants, and although Xenocrates assures us that %0athere is no bodily malady for which the trychnos is not highly %0abeneficial, they are none of them so valuable as to make me %0athink it proper to speak more at length upon the subject, more %0aparticularly as there are so many other remedies, which are %0aunattended with danger. Persons who wish to pass themselves %0aoff for true prophets, and who know too well how to impose %0a"upon the superstitions of others, take the root of the halicaca¬ %0ahum in drink. The remedy against this poison—and it is with %0amuch greater pleasure that I state it—is to driuk large quan¬ %0atities of honied wine made hot. I must not omit the fact, %0atoo, that this plant is naturally so baneful to the asp, that W'hen %0athe root is placed near that reptile, the very animal which %0akills others by striking them with torpor, is struck with torpor %0a%0a“ Apertius,” as suggested by Sillig, is a preferable reading to “ par- %0acius.” %0a%0aFrojn fiavia, “madness.” %0a%0a“ The Physalis somnifera of Linnaeus, the somniferous nightshade. %0a%0aThe Solauum melongena of Linnaeus. %0a%0aTOL.

Challenging him %0a%3c to a trial of skill, she would repeatedly vary her designs, and %0a%3c thus it was in reality a contest between art and Nature ; a fact %0a%3c which we find attested by pictures of that artist even still in %0a%3c existence, more particularly the one known as the “ Stephane- %0a%3c l»locos,”'“ in which he has given a likeness of Glycera herself. %0a%3c This invention, therefore, is only to be traced to later than the %0a%3c Hundredth’’ Olympiad. %0a%3c %0a%3c Chaplets of flowers being now the fashion, it Avas not long %0a%3c before those came into vogue which are known to us as %0a%3c %0a%3c ^ Fee makes the word “vocahulum” apply to “corona,” and not to %0a%3c “ struppns but the passage will hardly admit of that rendering. %0a%3c %0a%3c * “To bind” or “join together.’’ %0a%3c %0a%3c ® A “ connected line,” from the verb “ sero.” %0a%3c %0a%3c ’ By “quod,” Hardouin takes Pliny to mean, the use of the word %0a%3c ciraprbv, among the Greeks, corresponding with the Latin word “ sertum.” %0a%3c %0a%3c ** These chaplets, we learn from Festus, were called “ pancarpiae.” %0a%3c The olive, oak, laurel, and myrtle, were the trees first used for chaplets. %0a%3c %0a%3c ® See B. ixxv. c. 40. %0a%3c %0a%3c . *® The “ Chaplet-weaver.” See B. xxxv. c. 40. %0a%3c %0a%3c ” B.C. 380. %0a%3c %0a%3c TOL.

For a long period these lemnisci were desti¬ %0a%3c tute of ornament P.

For it was the usage of the citizens to go down in %0a%3c person to take part in the contests of the Circus, and to %0a%3c send their slaves and horses thither as well. Hence it is that %0a%3c we find it thus written in the laws of the Twelve Tables: %0a%3c %0a%3c 12 From Atlienoeus, B. xv. c. 2, et seq., we learn that the Egyptian %0a%3c chaplets were made of ivy, narcissus, pomegranate blossoms, &c. %0a%3c %0a%3c ‘2 “Corolla,” being the diminutive of “corona.” %0a%3c %0a%3c 1* Or tinsel. is The “ Rich.” %0a%3c %0a%3c IS Ribbons or streamers. i^ “Puri.” %0a%3c %0a%3c IS Consul, A.u.c. 570. %0a%3c %0a%3c IS Or “engrave,” “caelare.” Jle is probably speaking here of golden %0a%3c lemnisci. %0a%3c %0a%3c 20 “ Philyr®.” This was properly the inner bark of the linden-tree; %0a%3c but it is not improbable that thin plates of metal were also so called, from %0a%3c che resemblance.

Well then, what was the honour ac¬ %0a%3c quired thereby ? It was the right secured bythe victor, for %0a%3c himself and for his parents, after death, to be crowned with¬ %0a%3c out fail, while the body was laid out in the house,** and on its %0a%3c being carried** to the tomb. %0a%3c %0a%3c On other occasions, chaplets were not indiscriminately %0a%3c worn, not even those which had been won in the games. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 6.-THE SEVERITY OF THE AHCIEHTS IN REFERENCE TO %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPLETS. %0a%3c %0a%3c Indeed the rules upon this point were remarkably severe. %0a%3c L. Fulvius, a banker,** having been accused, at the time of %0a%3c the Second Punic War, of looking down from the balcony*® %0a%3c of his house upon the Forum, with a chaplet of roses upon %0a%3c his head, was imprisoned by order of the Senate, and was not %0a%3c liberated before the war was brought to a close. P. Muna- %0a%3c tius, having placed upon his head a chaplet of flowers taken %0a%3c from the statue of Marsyas,*® was condemned by the Trium¬ %0a%3c viri to be put in chains. Upon his making appeal to the %0a%3c tribunes of the people, they refused to intercede in his behalf %0a%3c —a very different state of things to that at Athens, where %0a%3c the young men,*’ in their dnmken revelry, were in the habit, %0a%3c %0a%3c ** “ Pecunia.” Fee compares this usage with the employment of jockies %0a%3c at horse-races in England and France. %0a%3c %0a%3c “ Intus positus esset.” •* “ Foris ferretur.” %0a%3c %0a%3c 2* Or “ money-changer,” ‘‘ argentarius.” %0a%3c %0a%3c “ “E pergula sua.” Scaliger thinks that the “pergula” was a part %0a%3c of a house built out into the street, while, according to Ernesti,^ it was a %0a%3c little room in the upper part of a house. In B. xxxv. c. 36, it clearly %0a%3c means a room on the ground-floor. %0a%3c %0a%3c 26 In the Fora of ancient cities there was frequently a statue of this my¬ %0a%3c thological personage, with one hand erect, in token, Servius says (on %0a%3c B. iv. 1. 58 of the iEneid), of the freedom of the state, Marsyas having been %0a%3c the minister of Bacchus, the god of liberty. His statue in the Forum of %0a%3c Rome was the place of assembly for the courtesans of that city, who used %0a%3c to crown it with chaplets ot flow’crs. See also Horace i.

AN %0a%3c %0a%3c ANECDOTE RELATIVE TO Q0EEN CLEOPATRA AND CHAPLETS. %0a%3c %0a%3c Among the Greeks, the physicians Mnesitheus and Calli¬ %0a%3c machus have written separate treatises on the subject of %0a%3c chaplets, making mention of such flowers as are injurious to %0a%3c the head.®® For, in fact, the health is here concerned to some %0a%3c extent, as it is at the moments of carousal and gaiety in par¬ %0a%3c ticular that penetrating odours steal insidiously upon the %0a%3c brain—witness an instance in the wicked cunning displayed %0a%3c upon one occasion by Cleopatra. %0a%3c %0a%3c At the time when preparations were making for the battle %0a%3c that was eventually fought at Actiura, Antonius held the %0a%3c queen in such extreme distrust as to be in dread of her very %0a%3c attentions even, and would not so much as touch his food, %0a%3c unless another person had tasted it first. Upon this, the %0a%3c queen, it is said, wishing to amuse herself with his fears, had %0a%3c - the extremities of the flowers in a chaplet dipped in poison, and %0a%3c then placed it upon her head.®^ After a time, as the hilarity %0a%3c increased apace, she challenged Antonius to swallow the chap¬ %0a%3c es At the conclusion of the festival of Mars on the 1st of March, and %0a%3c for several successive days. These entertainments were celebrated in the %0a%3c Temple of that god, and were proverbial for their excellence. %0a%3c %0a%3c “ It is a well-known fact, as Fee remarks, that the smell of flowers is %0a%3c productive, in some persons, of head-ache, nausea, and vertigo. He states %0a%3c also that persons have been known to meet their death from sleeping all %0a%3c night in the midst of odoriferous flowers. %0a%3c %0a%3c “Ipsaque capiti imposita.” Holland and Ajasson render this as %0a%3c tlioimh Cleopatra placed the garland on Antony’s head, and not her owu. %0a%3c Littr'^ agrees with the translation here adopted. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 310 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Pliny’s natubal histoey. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [nook XXI. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c lets, mixed up with their drink. Who, under such circumstances %0a%3c as these, could have apprehended treachery? Accordingly, %0a%3c the leaves were stripped from off the chaplet, and thrown into %0a%3c ihe cup. Just as Antonius was on the very point of drinking, %0a%3c she arrested his arm with her hand.—“ Behold, Marcus An¬ %0a%3c tonius,” said she, “ the woman against whom you are so care¬ %0a%3c ful to take these new precautions of yours in employing your %0a%3c tasters! And would then, if I could exist without you, either %0a%3c means or opportunity of effecting my purpose be wanting to %0a%3c me?” Saying this, she ordered a man to be brought from %0a%3c prison, and made him drink off the potion; he did so, and %0a%3c fell dead®® upon the spot. %0a%3c %0a%3c Besides the two authors above-mentioned, Theophrastus,®* %0a%3c among the Greeks, has written on the subject of flowers. %0a%3c Some of our own writers also have given the title of “ Antho- %0a%3c logica” to their works, but no one, to my knowledge at least, %0a%3c has treated expressly^® of flowers. In fact, we ourselves have %0a%3c no intention here of discussing the mode of wearing chaplets, %0a%3c for that would be frivolous^^ indeed ; but shall proceed to %0a%3c state such particulars in relation to flowers as shall appear to %0a%3c us deserving of remark. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 10 . ( 4 .) —THE EOSE : TWELVE VAEIETIES OF IT. %0a%3c %0a%3c The people of our country were acquainted with but very %0a%3c few garland flowers among the garden plants, and those few %0a%3c hardly any but the violet and the rose. The plant which bears %0a%3c the rose is, properly speaking, more of a thorn than a shrub— %0a%3c indeed, we sometimes find it growing on a bramble^* even; %0a%3c the flower having, even then, a pleasant smell, though by no %0a%3c means penetrating. The flower in all roses is originally en¬ %0a%3c closed in a bud,^® with a grained surface within, which gra¬ %0a%3c dually swells, and assumes the form of a green pointed cone, %0a%3c similar to our alabaster^^ unguent boxes in shape. Gradually %0a%3c %0a%3c Fee remarks that we know of no poisons, hydrocyanic or prussic acid %0a%3c excepted, so instantaneous in their effects as this; and that it is very %0a%3c doubtful if they were acquainted with that poison. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hist.

The flower is steeped in oil, a %0a%3c practice which has prevailed from the times of the Trojan war, %0a%3c as Homer‘® bears witness; in addition to which, it now forms %0a%3c an ingredient in our unguents, as mentioned on a previous %0a%3c occasion.^^ It is employed also by itself for certain medicinal %0a%3c purposes, and is used in plasters and eye-salves^* for its pene¬ %0a%3c trating qualities : it is used, also, to perfume the delicacies of %0a%3c our banquets, and is never attended with any noxious results. %0a%3c %0a%3c The most esteemed kinds of rose among us are those of %0a%3c Prseneste'** and Campania.®* Some persons have added to these %0a%3c varieties the rose of Miletus,®^ the flower of which is an ex¬ %0a%3c tremely brilliant red, and has never more than a dozen petals. %0a%3c The next to it is the rose of TrachjTi,®* not so red as the last, %0a%3c and then that of Alabanda,®® with whitish petals, but not so %0a%3c highly esteemed. The least esteemed of all, however, is the %0a%3c thorn rose,®^ the petals of which are numerous, but extremely %0a%3c %0a%3c Still, even for that purpose the rose Avas very extensively used. One %0a%3c ancient author states that, even in the middle of winter, the more luxurious %0a%3c liomans were not satisfied without roses swimming in their Falernian wine; %0a%3c and we find Horace repeatedly alluding to the chaplets of roses worn by %0a%3c the guests at banquets. Hence probably arose the expression, “Under %0a%3c the rose.” Fee is evidently mistaken in thinking that Pliny implies here, %0a%3c that it was but rarely used in chaplets. %0a%3c %0a%3c II. xxiii. 1. 186.

B. iv. 1. 119, %0a%3c “ Bifcrique rosaria Paesti”—" And the rose-beds of Paestum, that bear %0a%3c twice in the year.” It has been suggested that it is identical with the %0a%3c Bosa alba vulgaris major of Bauhin, the Rosa alba of Decandolle; but, %0a%3c as F4e says, it is very questionable if this is correct, this white rose blossom¬ %0a%3c ing but once a year. _ . i i %0a%3c %0a%3c A simple variety of the Rosa Gallica of Linnaeus, Fee thinks. %0a%3c %0a%3c See B. iv. c. 14.

The number of the petals, %0a%3c which is never less than five, goes on increasing in amount, %0a%3c till we find one variety with as many as a hundred, and %0a%3c thence known as the “ centifolia :”*■ in Italy, it is to be found %0a%3c in Campania, and in Greece, in the vicinity of Philippi, though %0a%3c this last is not the place of its natural*® growth. Mount Pan- %0a%3c gaeus,*® in the same vicinity, produces a rose with numerous %0a%3c petals of diminutive size : the people of those parts are in the %0a%3c habit of transplanting it, a method which greatly tends to im¬ %0a%3c prove its growth. This kind, however, is not remarkable for %0a%3c its smell, nor yet is the rose which has a very large or very %0a%3c broad petal: indeed, we may state in a few words, that the %0a%3c best proof of the perfume of the flower is the comparative %0a%3c roughness of the calyx.®® %0a%3c %0a%3c Caepio, who lived in the reign of the Emperor Tiberius, as¬ %0a%3c serts that the centifolia is never employed for chaplets, except %0a%3c at the extreme®^ points of union as it were, being remarkable %0a%3c neither for its smelF nor its beauty. There is another variety %0a%3c %0a%3c in all probability. Fee makes mention here of a kind called the Rosa %0a%3c myriacantha by Decandolle (the “ thousand-thornrose”), which is found in %0a%3c great abundance in the south of Europe, and other parts of it. %0a%3c %0a%3c Fee remarks on this passage, that the beauty of the flower and the %0a%3c number of the petals are always in an inverse proportion to the number of %0a%3c thorns, which disappear successively the more carefully the plant is culti¬ %0a%3c vated. %0a%3c %0a%3c 5’ This is most probably the meaning of “ Aspcritate, levore.” %0a%3c %0a%3c Still known as the Rosa centifolia.” Its petals sometimes exceed %0a%3c three hundred in number ; and it is the most esteemed of all for its frag¬ %0a%3c rant smell. %0a%3c %0a%3c “ Non suae terrae proventu.” %0a%3c %0a%3c This rose is mentioned also by Theophrastus, Hist. Plant. B. vi. c, 6. %0a%3c From the description that Pliny gives of it. Fee is inclined to think that %0a%3c it is some variety of the Rosa rubrifolia, which is often found in moun¬ %0a%3c tainous localities. %0a%3c %0a%3c This assertion is borrowed from Theophrastus, Hist. Plant. B. vi. c. %0a%3c 6. Fee remarks that there is no truth in it. It is not improbable, how¬ %0a%3c ever, that the word “cortex” here may mean, not the calyx, but the bark %0a%3c of the stem, in reference to its exemptiom from thorns. The to %0a%3c %0a%3c KUTw of Theophrastus would seem to admit of that rendering. See Note %0a%3c ^ above. %0a%3c %0a%3c “ Extremes velut ad cardines.” %0a%3c %0a%3c This is not the case with the Rosa centifolia of modern botany. See %0a%3c Note above. It is not improbable, however, that the reading is “pro- %0a%3c babilis,” and that this passage belongs to the next sentence. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 10.] • %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c THE BOSE. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 313 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c of rose, too, called the “Grecian” rose by our people, and %0a%3c “ lychnis by the Greeks: it grows nowhere except in %0a%3c humid soils, and has never more than five petals: it does not %0a%3c exceed the violet in size, and is destitute of smell. There is %0a%3c another kind, again, known to us as the “ Grsecula,” the %0a%3c petals of which are tightly rolled together, and which never %0a%3c open except when pressed in the hand, it having always the %0a%3c appearance, in fact, of being in bud: the petals of it are re¬ %0a%3c markably large. Another kind, again, springs from a stem %0a%3c like that of the mallow, the leaves being similar to those of %0a%3c the olive—the name given to it is “ macetum.”®® There is %0a%3c the rose of autumn, too, known to us as the “ coroniola,”®® %0a%3c M'hich is of a middle size, between the varieties just mentioned. %0a%3c All these kinds, however, are destitute of smell, with the %0a%3c exception of the coroniola, and the one which grows on the %0a%3c bramble so extended is the scope for fictitious®® productions! %0a%3c %0a%3c And, indeed, the genuine rose, for the most part, is indebted %0a%3c for its qualities to the nature of the soil. That of Cyrenae®® is %0a%3c the most odoriferous of all, and hence it is that the unguents %0a%3c of that place are so remarkably fine: at Carthage, again, in %0a%3c Spain, there are early''® roses throughout all the winter. The %0a%3c temperature, too, of the climate is not without its influence : %0a%3c for in some years we find the roses much less odoriferous than %0a%3c in others; in addition to which, their smell is always more %0a%3c powerful when grown in dry soils’' than in humid ones. The %0a%3c %0a%3c ®® The Lychnis, Fee remarks, is erroneously classed by Pliny among %0a%3c the roses. It is generally agreed among naturalists that it is the garden %0a%3c flower, the Agrostemma coronaria of Linnaeus; which, however, does not %0a%3c grow in humid soils, but in steep, rocky places. %0a%3c %0a%3c “ Or “small Greek” rose. Some commentators have identified it with %0a%3c the Rosa silvestris, odorata, flore albo of C. Bauhin, a wild white rose. %0a%3c %0a%3c “ Sillig thinks that this may moan the “Macedonian” rose. Another %0a%3c reading is “moscheuton.” Fee says that it is not a rose at all, but one of %0a%3c the Malvaceae belonging to the genus Alcaea; one variety of which is %0a%3c called the Alccea rosa. %0a%3c %0a%3c “ Or “little chaplet.” Possibly a variety of the Eglantine, the Rosa %0a%3c canina or dog-rose. Fee suggests. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Eglantine. %0a%3c %0a%3c This seems to be the meaning of “ tot modis adulteratur the roses %0a%3c without smell appearing to him to be not genuim roses. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Rosa Damasccna of Miller, Fee thinks, our Damascus rose. %0a%3c %0a%3c ™ The earliest rose in France and Spain, Fee says, is the “pompon,” %0a%3c the variety Pomponma of the Rosa centifolia. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is consistent with modern experience. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 314 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c pliny’s natural history. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XXI. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c rose does not admit of being planted in either a rich or an %0a%3c argillaceous soil, nor yet on irrigated land; being contented %0a%3c with a thin, light earth, and more particularly attached to %0a%3c ground on which old building rubbish has been laid. %0a%3c %0a%3c The rose of Campania is early, that of Miletus late, but it is %0a%3c the rose of Prseneste that goes off the very latest of all.

(5.)-THE LILY : POUR VARIETIES OF IT. %0a%3c %0a%3c The lily holds the next highest rank after the rose, and has %0a%3c a certain affinity” with it in respect of its unguent and the %0a%3c oil extracted from it, which is known to us as “ lirinon.”” %0a%3c %0a%3c From Theophrastus, Hist.

The moaning of this passage, %0a%3c however, is extremely doubtful. “ Unum genus inseritur pallidae, spinos®, %0a%3c longissimis virgis, quinquifoli®, quse Gracis altera est.” %0a%3c %0a%3c If the water was only lukewarm, Fee says, it would be of no use, %0a%3c and if hotter, the speedy death of the tree would be the result. %0a%3c %0a%3c “ Quadam cognatione.” He alludes to a maceration of the petals of %0a%3c the rose and lily in oil. The aroma of the lily, Fee says, has not been %0a%3c fixed by any method yet found. %0a%3c %0a%3c See B. xiii. c. 2. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 11.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c THE LILT. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 315 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Blended, too, with roses, the lily'^ produces a remarkably fine %0a%3c effect; for it begins to make its appearance, in fact, just as the %0a%3c rose is in the -very middle of its season. There is no fiowcr %0a%3c that grows to a greater height than the lily, sometimes, in¬ %0a%3c deed, as much as three cubits; the head of it being always %0a%3c drooping, as though the neck of the flower were unable to %0a%3c support its weight. The whiteness of the lily is quite remark¬ %0a%3c able, the petals being striated on the exterior; the flower is %0a%3c narrow at the base, and gradually expanding in shape like a %0a%3c tapering’® cup with the ed^es curving outwards, the ^e pistils %0a%3c of the flower, and the stamens with their antherae of a saffron %0a%3c colour, standing erect in the middle.®® Hence the perfume of %0a%3c the lily, as well as its colour, is two-fold, there being one for %0a%3c the petals and another for the stamens. The difference, how¬ %0a%3c ever, between them is but very small, and when the flower is %0a%3c employed for making lily unguents and oils, the petals are %0a%3c never rejected. %0a%3c %0a%3c There is a flower, not unlike the lily, produced by the plant %0a%3c known to us as the “ convolvulus.”®’ It grows among shrubs, %0a%3c is totally destitute of smell, and has not the yellow antherse of %0a%3c the lily within : only vying with it in its whiteness, it would %0a%3c almost appear to be the rough sketch®® made by Nature when %0a%3c she was learning how to make the lily. The white lily is %0a%3c propagated in all the various ways which are employed for the %0a%3c cultivation of the rose,®® as also by means of a certain tearlike %0a%3c %0a%3c The Lilium candidum of Linnaeus. Fee remarks that the “ Lilium” %0a%3c of the Eomans and the Xeipiov of the Greeks is evidently derived from %0a%3c the laleh of the Persians. %0a%3c %0a%3c “ Calathi.” The “calathus” was a work-basket of tapering shape ; %0a%3c it was also used for carrying fruits and flowers, Ovid, Art. Am. ii. 264. %0a%3c Cups, too, for wine were called by this name, Virg. Eel. v. 7i. %0a%3c %0a%3c As this passage has been somewhat amplified in the translation, it %0a%3c will perhaps be as well to insert it: “ Eesupinis per ambitum labris, te- %0a%3c nuique pilo et staminum stantibus in medio crocis.” %0a%3c %0a%3c The Convolvulus sajpium of modem botany; the only resemblance %0a%3c in which to the lily is in the colour, it being totally dififerent in every other %0a%3c respect. %0a%3c %0a%3c “ Eudimentum.” She must have set to work in a very roundabout %0a%3c way, Fee thinks, and one in which it would be quite impossible for a na¬ %0a%3c turalist to follow her. %0a%3c %0a%3c The white lily is reproduced from the oflTsets of the bulbs; and, ns %0a%3c Fee justly remarks, it is highly absurd to compare the mode of culti¬ %0a%3c vation with that of the rose, which is propagated from slips. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 316 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Pliny’s natural uistout. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XXI %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c gum®^ which belongs to it, similarly to hipposelinum®® in fact: %0a%3c indeed, there is no plant that is more prolific than this, a sin¬ %0a%3c gle root often giving birth to as man)'^ as fifty bulbs.®® There %0a%3c is, also, a red lily, known by the name of “ crinon’’®’ to the %0a%3c Greeks, though there are some authors who call the flower of %0a%3c it “ cjmorrodon.”®® The most esteemed are those of Antiochia %0a%3c and Laodicea in Syria, and next to them that of Phaselis.®** %0a%3c To the fourth rank belongs the flower that grows in Italy. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 12 . —THE NAKCISSUS : THREE VARIETIES OF IT. %0a%3c %0a%3c There is a purple®” lily, too, which sometimes has a double %0a%3c stem; it differs only from the other lilies in having a more %0a%3c fleshy root and a bulb of larger size, but undivided: ®‘ the %0a%3c name given to it is “ narcissus.”®® A second variety of this lily %0a%3c has a white flower, with a purple corolla. There is also this %0a%3c difference between the ordinaiy lily and the narcissus, that in %0a%3c the latter the leaves spring from the root of the plant. The %0a%3c finest are those which grow on the mountains of Lycia. A %0a%3c third variety is similar to the others in every respect, except %0a%3c that the corolla of the plant is green. They are all of them %0a%3c late®® flowers: indeed, they only bloom after the setting of %0a%3c A returns,®* and at the time of the autumnal equinox. %0a%3c %0a%3c This absurd notion is derived from Theophrastus, Hist. Plant. B. ii. %0a%3c c. 2, and B, vi. c. 6. ■ See B. xix. c. 48. %0a%3c %0a%3c The root really consists of certain fine fibres, to which the bulbs, or %0a%3c rather cloves or offsets, are attached. %0a%3c %0a%3c Judging from what Theocritus says, in his 35th Idyl, the “ crinon” %0a%3c would appear to have been a white lily. Sprengel, however, takes the red %0a%3c lily of Pliny to be the scarlet lily, the Lilium Chalcedonicum of Linnaeus. %0a%3c %0a%3c bs Or “ dog-rosea name now given to one of the wild roses. %0a%3c %0a%3c See B. xiii. c. 9. %0a%3c %0a%3c Pee remarks, that it is singular that Pliny, as also Virgil, Eel. v. 1. 38, %0a%3c should have given the epithet “ purpureus” to the Narcissus.

By this method purple lilies are %0a%3c obtained, it being a very remarkable thing that we should be %0a%3c able to dye a plant to such a degree as to make it produce a %0a%3c coloured flower. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 14 .

THE FIVE VARIETIES %0a%3c OF THE YELLOW VIOLET. %0a%3c %0a%3c Kext after the roses and the lilies, the violet is held in the %0a%3c highest esteem: of this there are several varieties, the pur¬ %0a%3c ple,®® the yellow, and the white, all of them reproduced from %0a%3c plants, like the cabbage. The purple violet, which springs %0a%3c up spontaneously in sunny spots, with a thin, meagre soil, has %0a%3c larger petals than the others, springing immediately from the %0a%3c root, which is of a fleshy substance. This violet has a name, %0a%3c too, distinct from the other wild kinds, being called “ion, ®® %0a%3c and from it the iantbine ’ cloth takes its name. %0a%3c %0a%3c Among the cultivated kinds, the yellow® violet is held in the %0a%3c greatest esteem. The Tusculan violet, and that known as the %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 95 Fee remarks, that the extravagant proceeding here described by %0a%3c Pliny with a seriousness that is perfectly ridiculous, does not meiit any %0a%3c %0a%3c s^when detached from the bulb, the stem of the lily will infallibly die. %0a%3c ” “Nudantibus se nodulis.” There are no such knots in the lily, as %0a%3c %0a%3c Fee remarks. „„ r %0a%3c %0a%3c 99 The Viola odorata of Linn®us. ®® The Greek name. %0a%3c %0a%3c * “Iiinthina vestis,” violet-coloured. /n. • • t i 17 ' %0a%3c %0a%3c 2 Desfontaines identifies this with the Cheiranthus Cheiri; but Fee savs %0a%3c that there is little doubt that it belongs to the \ lola tricolor herbensis %0a%3c (pansy, or heart’s-ease), in the petals of which the yellow predominates %0a%3c and the type of which is the field violet, or Viola arvensis. the flowers of %0a%3c which are extremely small, and entirely yellon. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 318 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c flint’s natural history. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XXI. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c “ marine ” ’ violet, have petals somewhat broader than the %0a%3c others, but not so odoriferous; the Galatian ^ violet, too, which %0a%3c has a smaller leaf, is entirely destitute of smell.

Fee adopts the reading “ Calathiana,” and considers it to have %0a%3c received that name from its resemblance to the Caltha mentioned in the %0a%3c next Chapter. Dalechamps identifies it with the Digitalis purpurea; %0a%3c Gessner, Dodonaeus, and Thalius, with the Gentiana pneumonanthe, others %0a%3c with the Gentiana ciliata and Pannonica, and Sprengel with the Gentiana %0a%3c verna of Linnaeus. Fee admits himself totally at a loss on the subject. %0a%3c %0a%3c 3 ‘‘ Concolori amplitudine." Gronovius, with considerable justice, ex¬ %0a%3c presses himself at a loss as to the exact meaning of these words. If %0a%3c Sprengel and Salmasius are right in their conjectures that the Caltha of %0a%3c Pliny and Virgil is the marigold, our Calendula officinalis, the passage %0a%3c cannot mean that the flower of it is of the same size and colour with %0a%3c any variety of the violet mentioned in the preceding Chapter. From the %0a%3c description given of it by Dioscorides, it is more than probable that the %0a%3c Caltha of the ancients is not the marigold, and Hardouin is probably %0a%3c right in his conjecture that Pliny intends to describe a variety of the violet %0a%3c under the name. Fee is at a loss as to its identification. %0a%3c %0a%3c ® Or “ royal broom.” Sprengel thinks that this is the Chenopodium %0a%3c Bcoparia, a plant common in Greece and Italy; and Fee is inclined to %0a%3c coincide with that opinion, though, as he says, there are numerous other %0a%3c plants with odoriferous leaves and pliant shoots, as its name, broom, would %0a%3c seem to imply. Other writers would identify it with a Sideritis, and %0a%3c others, again, with an Achillaea. %0a%3c %0a%3c See B. xii. c. 26. Fee is inclined to coincide with Euellius, and to %0a%3c identify this with the Digitalis purpurea, clown’s spikenard, or our Lady’s %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 17.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c SAFFliON. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 319 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c is odoriferous in the root only. In former times, it was the %0a%3c practice to make imguents of this root, as we learn from the %0a%3c poet Aristophanes, a writer of the Ancient Comedy; from %0a%3c which circumstance some persons have erroneously given the %0a%3c name of “ exotic to the plant. The smell of it strongly re¬ %0a%3c sembles that of cinnamomum; and the plant grows in thin %0a%3c soils, which are free from all humidity. %0a%3c %0a%3c The name of “ oombretum is given to a plant that bears %0a%3c a very strong resemblance to it, the leaves of which taper to %0a%3c the fineness of threads; in height, however, it is taller than %0a%3c the bacchar. These are the only The error, %0a%3c %0a%3c however, ought to be corrected, on the part of those who have %0a%3c bestowed upon the bacchar the name of “ field nard for that %0a%3c in reality is the surname given to another plant, known to the %0a%3c Greeks as “ asaron,” the description and features of which we %0a%3c have already mentioned, when speaking of the different va¬ %0a%3c rieties of nard. I fi.nd, too, that the name of “ asaron ” has %0a%3c been given to this plant, from the circumstance of its never %0a%3c being employed in the composition of chaplets, %0a%3c %0a%3c CUAP. 17.-SAFFROir : IN WHAT PLACES IT GROWS BEST.

The only strong objection to this is the fact that the root of the %0a%3c digitalis has a very faint but disagreeable smell, and not at all like that of %0a%3c cinnamon. But then, as Fee says, we have no positive proof that the %0a%3c “cinnamomum” of the ancients is identical with our cinnamon. See Vol. %0a%3c iii. p. 138. Sprengel takes the “ bacchar” of Virgil to be the Valeriana %0a%3c Celtica, and the “ baccharis” of the Greeks to be the Gnaphalium san- %0a%3c guineum, a plant of Egypt and Palestine.

This plant is everywhere degenerating,'* %0a%3c and is far from prolific at Cyrenae even, a place where the %0a%3c flowers are always of the very finest quality. The most es¬ %0a%3c teemed saffron, however, is that of Cilicia, and there of Mount %0a%3c Corycus in particular; next comes the saffron of Mount Olym¬ %0a%3c pus, in Lycia, and then of Centuripa, in Sicily ; some persons, %0a%3c however, have given the second rank to the Phlegraean '* saf- %0a%3c iron. %0a%3c %0a%3c There is nothing so much adulterated’® as saffron : the best %0a%3c proof of its goodness is when it snaps under pressure by the %0a%3c fingers, as though it were friable;’'' for when it is moist, a %0a%3c state which it owes to being adulterated, it is limp, and will %0a%3c not snap asunder. Another way of testing it, again, is to %0a%3c apply it with the hand to the face, upon which, if good, it will %0a%3c be found to be slightly caustic to the face and eyes. There is %0a%3c a peculiar kind, too, of cultivated saffron, which is in general %0a%3c extremely mild, being only of middling ’® quality ; the name %0a%3c given to it is “ dialeucon.”’® The saffron of Cyrenaica, again, %0a%3c is faulty in the opposite extreme; for it is darker than any %0a%3c other kind, and is apt to spoil very quickly. The best saffron %0a%3c everywhere is tliat which is of the most unctuous quality, and %0a%3c the filaments of which are the shortest; the worst being that %0a%3c which emits a musty smell. %0a%3c %0a%3c Mucianus informs us that in Lycia, at the end of seven or %0a%3c eight years, the saffron is transplanted into a piece of ground %0a%3c which has been prepared for the purpose, and that in this way %0a%3c %0a%3c 14 “Degenerans ubique.” Judging from what he states below, he may %0a%3c possibly meau, if grown repeatedly on the same soil. %0a%3c %0a%3c He may allude either to the city of Phlegra of Macedonia, or to the %0a%3c Phlegraean Plains in Campania, which were remaj'kable for their fertility. %0a%3c Virgil speaks of the saffron of Mount Tmolus in Cilicia. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is very extensively adulterated tvith the petals of the marigold, as %0a%3c also the Cartbamus tinctorius, saflBower, or bastard saffron. %0a%3c %0a%3c ” This is the case ; for when it is brittle it shows that it has not been %0a%3c adulterated with water, to add to its weight. %0a%3c %0a%3c Perhaps the reading here, “ Cijm sit in medio candidum,” is prefer¬ %0a%3c able ; “ because it is white in the middle.” , %0a%3c %0a%3c " White throughout.” %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 18.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c THE NATURE OP ODOURS. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ;2l %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c it is prevented from degenerating.

It was discharged through pipes of very minute %0a%3c bore, so that it fell upon the .spectators in the form of the finest dust. See %0a%3c Lucretius, 13. ii. 1. 416; Lucan, Phars. ix. 1. 808—810; and Seneca, Epist. %0a%3c 92. %0a%3c %0a%3c It flowers so rapidly, in fact, that it is diiScult to avoid the loss of a %0a%3c part of the harvest. %0a%3c %0a%3c ** The whole of this passage ie from Theophrastus, De Odorib. %0a%3c %0a%3c ^ This statement, though borrowed from Theophrastus, is not consis¬ %0a%3c tent with fact. The root of saffron is not more long-lived than any other %0a%3c bulbs of the Liliaceae. %0a%3c %0a%3c ^ Because, Dalechamps says, all the juices are thereby thrown back into %0a%3c the root, which consequently bears a stronger flower the next year. %0a%3c %0a%3c “ II. xiv. 1. 348. ** See B. xiii. c. 32. %0a%3c %0a%3c All these statements as to the odours of various substances, are from %0a%3c Theophrastus, De Causis, B. vi. c. 22. %0a%3c %0a%3c He does not say, however, that it is but rarely that a bitter substance %0a%3c is not odoriferous ; a sense in which Fee seems to have understood him, as %0a%3c he says, “ This assertion is not true in general, and there are numerous %0a%3c %0a%3c VOL.

The rose, when fresh %0a%3c gathered, has a more powerful smell at a distance, and dried,®* %0a%3c when brought nearer. All plants have a more penetrating %0a%3c odour, also, in spring and in the morning; as the hour of %0a%3c midday approaches, the scent becomes gradually weakened.®® %0a%3c The flowers, too, of young plants are less odoriferous than those %0a%3c of old ones ;■ but it is at mid-age that the odour is most pene¬ %0a%3c trating in them all. %0a%3c %0a%3c The rose and the crocus have a more powerful smell when %0a%3c gathered in fine weather, and all plants are more powerfully %0a%3c scented in hot climates than in cold ones. In Egypt, however, %0a%3c the flowers are far from odoriferous, owing to the dews and %0a%3c exhalations with which the air is charged, in consequence of %0a%3c the extended surface of the river. Some plants have an agree¬ %0a%3c able, though at the same time extremely powerful smell; some, %0a%3c again, while green, have no ®® smell at all, owing to the excess %0a%3c of moisture, the buceros for example, which is the same as %0a%3c %0a%3c exceptions; for instance, quassia ■wood, which is inodorous and yet in¬ %0a%3c tensely bitter.” The essential oil, he remarks, elaborated in the tissue of %0a%3c the corolla, is the ordinary source of the emanations of the flower. %0a%3c %0a%3c 3® Fee remarks that cultivation gives to plants a softer and more aqueous %0a%3c consistency, which is consequently injurious to the developement of the %0a%3c essential oil. %0a%3c %0a%3c Theophrastus, from whom this is borrowed, might have said witli %0a%3c more justice, Fee remarks, that certain roses have more odour when dried %0a%3c than when fresh gathered. Such is the case, he says, with the Provence %0a%3c rose. Fresh roses, however, have a more pronounced smell, the nearer %0a%3c they are to the olfactory organs. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is by no means invariably the case: in fact, the smell of most %0a%3c odoriferous plants is most powerful in summer. %0a%3c %0a%3c Because the essential oils evaporate more rapidly. %0a%3c %0a%3c With Littre, we adopt the reading “relate,” “mid-age,” and %0a%3c not “ aestate,” “ midsummer,” for although the assertion would be in %0a%3c general correct, Pliny would contradict the statement just made, that %0a%3c all plants have a more penetrating odour in spring. This reading is sup¬ %0a%3c ported also by the text of Theophrastus. %0a%3c %0a%3c Or saflfron. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is a just observation, but the instances might be greatly ex¬ %0a%3c tended, as Fee says. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 18.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c THE NATUEE OF OBOUES. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ■323 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c fenugreek.^’ Not all flowers which have a penetrating odour %0a%3c are destitute of juices, the violet, the rose, and the crocus, for %0a%3c example ; those, on the other hand, which have a penetrating %0a%3c odour, but are destitute of juices, have all of tliera a very pow¬ %0a%3c erful smell, as we find the case with the two varieties®® of the %0a%3c lily. The abrotonum and the amaracus have a pungent %0a%3c smell. In some plants, it is the flower only that is sweet, the %0a%3c other parts being inodorous, the violet and the rose, for example . %0a%3c %0a%3c Among the garden plants, the most odoriferous are the dry %0a%3c ones, such as rue, mint, and parsley, as also those which grow %0a%3c on dry soils. Some fruits become more odoriferous the older %0a%3c they are, the quince, for example, which has also a stronger %0a%3c smell when gathered than while upon the tree. Some plants, %0a%3c again, have no smell but when broken asiinder, or when bruised, %0a%3c and others only when they are stripped of their bark. Certain %0a%3c vegetable substances, too, only give out a smell when subjected %0a%3c to the action of fire, such as frankincense and myrrh, for ex¬ %0a%3c ample. All flowers are more bitter to the taste when bruised %0a%3c than when left untouched.^' Some plants preserve their smell %0a%3c a longer time when dried, the melilote, for example; others, %0a%3c again, make the place itself more odoriferous where they grow, %0a%3c the iris'*® for instance, which will even render the whole of a %0a%3c tree odoriferous, the roots of w^hich it may happen to have %0a%3c touched. The hesperis has a more powerful odour at night, %0a%3c a property to which it owes its name. %0a%3c %0a%3c Among the animals, we find none that are odoriferous, un¬ %0a%3c less, indeed, we are inclined to put faith in what has been said %0a%3c about the panther. %0a%3c %0a%3c See B. xviii. c. 39. %0a%3c %0a%3c The white lily and the red lily.

In the iris, it is the root " only that is held in esteem, %0a%3c it being extensively employed in perfumery and medicine. The %0a%3c iris of the finest quality is that found in Illyricum,'*® and in %0a%3c that country, eveu, not in the maritime parts of it, but in the %0a%3c forests on the banks of the river Drilon" and near Narona. %0a%3c The next best is that of Macedonia,®® the plant being extremely %0a%3c elongated, white, and thin. The iris of Africa®^ occupies the %0a%3c third rank, being the largest of them all, and of an extremely %0a%3c bitter taste. %0a%3c %0a%3c The iris of Illyricum comprehends two varieties—one of %0a%3c which is the raphanitis, so called from its resemblance to the %0a%3c radish,®^ of a somewhat red colour, and superior ®® in quality to %0a%3c the other, which is known as the “ rhizotomus.” The best %0a%3c kind of iris is that which produces sneezing ®* when handled. %0a%3c The stem of this plant is a cubit in length, and erect, the flower %0a%3c being of various colours, like the rainbow, to which circum¬ %0a%3c stance it is indebted for its name.

It is %0a%3c a marvellous feature in this plant, that it takes a delight in being %0a%3c gathered ; indeed, the more it is plucked, the better it grows. %0a%3c It comes into flower in the month of August, and lasts through¬ %0a%3c out the autumn. The finest of all is the amaranth of Alex¬ %0a%3c andria, w'hich is generally gathered for keeping; for it is a %0a%3c really marvellous” fact, that when all the other flowers have %0a%3c gone out, the amaranth, upon being dipped in water, comes to %0a%3c life again : it is used also for making winter chaplets. The %0a%3c peculiar quality of the amaranth is sufficiently indicated by %0a%3c its name, it having been so called from the circumstance that %0a%3c it never fades.’® %0a%3c %0a%3c Belonging, probably, Fee thinks, to the Cruciferae of the genera %0a%3c Hesperis and Cheiranthus. %0a%3c %0a%3c “ Flararaeis.” The “ flammeura,” or flame-coloured veil of the bride, %0a%3c was of a bright yellow, or rather orange-colour, perhaps. %0a%3c %0a%3c ’® The Celosia cristata of Linnaeus. %0a%3c %0a%3c ’® “ Spica.” The moderns have been enabled to equal the velvety ap¬ %0a%3c pearance of the amaranth in the tints imparted by them to their velvets. %0a%3c The Italians call it the “ velvet-flower.” %0a%3c %0a%3c ” The real fact is, that the amaranth, being naturally a dry flower, and %0a%3c having little humidity to lose, keeps better than most others. %0a%3c %0a%3c From the Greek «, “ not,” and [lapdivtaOai, “ to fade.” %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 328 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c PLIJrr’s NATUEAL HI8T0ET. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XXL %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 24 .- THE CTANOS : THE H0L0CHETS03. %0a%3c %0a%3c The name,” too, of the cyanos®® indicates its colour, and so %0a%3c does that of the holochrysos.®* None of these flowers were %0a%3c in use in the time of Alexander the Great, for the authors, we %0a%3c find, who flourished at a period immediately after his decease, %0a%3c have made not the slightest mention of them; from which %0a%3c circumstance it is very clear that they only came into fashion %0a%3c at a later period.

The petals of %0a%3c it are small, and five in number ; and it is a remarkable cir¬ %0a%3c cumstance in this plant, that the head of it droops at first, and %0a%3c it is only after it becomes erect that the petals make their ap¬ %0a%3c pearance, forming a small corolla of various colours, enclosing %0a%3c a yellow seed. %0a%3c %0a%3c The bellio,®® too, is a yellow flower, formed of®^ fifty-five %0a%3c filaments circularly arranged, in the shape of a chaplet.

Of such chaplets there are two kinds, one composed of %0a%3c flowers, the other of leaves.

The seed of thyme is so minute'® as to bo %0a%3c imperceptible, and yet that of origanum, which is also ex¬ %0a%3c tremely minute, does not escape the sight. But what matters %0a%3c it that Nature has thus concealed it from our view ? Por wo %0a%3c have reason to conclude that it exists in the flower itself; %0a%3c which, when sown in the ground, gives birth to the plant %0a%3c —what is there, in fact, that the industry of man has left %0a%3c untried ? %0a%3c %0a%3c The honey of Attica is generally looked upon as the best in %0a%3c all t''e world; for which reason it is that the thyme of that %0a%3c country has been transplanted, being reproduced, as already %0a%3c stated, with the greatest difficulty, from the blossom. But %0a%3c there is also another peculiarity in the nature of the thyme of %0a%3c Attica, which has greatly tended to frustrate these attempts— %0a%3c it will never live except in the vicinity of breezes from the %0a%3c sea. In former times, it was the general belief that this is the %0a%3c case with aU kinds of thyme, and that this is the reason why %0a%3c it does not grow in Arcadia at a period when it was univer¬ %0a%3c sally supposed, too, that the olive never grows beyond three %0a%3c hundred stadia'® from the sea. But, at the present day, we %0a%3c know for certain that in the province of Gallia Narbonensis %0a%3c the Stony Plains'® are quite overgrown with thyme; this being, %0a%3c in fact, the only source of revenue to those parts, thousands %0a%3c of sheep'’ being brought thither from distant countries to %0a%3c brawse upon the plant. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 32 . -CONYZA. %0a%3c %0a%3c There are two varieties of conyza, also, employed in making %0a%3c %0a%3c 13 From Theophrastus, Hist.

The iris,*’ %0a%3c also, blossoms in summer. All these flowers pass away, how¬ %0a%3c ever, and fade; upon which others assume their places in %0a%3c autumn, a third kind of lily,*® for instance, saffron, and two %0a%3c varieties of the orsinum*®—one of them inodorous and the other %0a%3c scented—making their appearance, all of them, as soon as the %0a%3c first autumnal showers fall. %0a%3c %0a%3c The garland-makers employ the flowers of the thorn®* even %0a%3c for making chaplets; the tender shoots, too, of the white %0a%3c thorn are sometimes preserved as a choice morsel®’ to tempt %0a%3c the palate. %0a%3c %0a%3c Such is the succession of the summer flowers in the parts %0a%3c beyond sea: in Italy, the violet is succeeded by the rose, the %0a%3c lily comes on while the rose is still in flower, the cyanus®' suc¬ %0a%3c ceeds the rose, and the amaranth the cyanus. As to the vin- %0a%3c %0a%3c Theophrastus, Hist. Plant. B. vi. c. 7, mentions the “ cerinthus” %0a%3c next after the flower of Jove : Pliny seems to have taken it for a kind of %0a%3c lily. This flower has not been identified. %0a%3c %0a%3c Sprengel takes this to be the Lavandula spica, or Lavender. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hardouin identifies this with the Lychnis Chalcedonica, or Cross of %0a%3c Jerusalem, with which opinion Fee seems inclined to coincide. Other %0a%3c commentators incline to the opinion that it is the Jasminum friiticans, a %0a%3c plant in which, beyond its smell, there is nothing at all remarkable. The %0a%3c exotic monocotyledon, known as the “ Pothos,” has no connection with %0a%3c the plant here mentioned. %0a%3c %0a%3c This, according to some, is the Lychnis Chalcedonica, the next being %0a%3c the Jasminum fruticans. %0a%3c %0a%3c As known to us, all the varieties of the iris blossom in spring. %0a%3c %0a%3c 5* The purple lily.

B. vi. c. 7, has read opaivb^ by mistake for optivog, “moun¬ %0a%3c tainous,” the original meaning being, “ Two varieties of saffron, one of them %0a%3c growing on the mountains, the other cultivated;” and this last word being %0a%3c rendered by Pliny “ hebes,” translated above as meaning “ inodorous.” %0a%3c %0a%3c The Acanthus, probably.

On the contrary, Virgil says, Georg, iv. 1. 20, that %0a%3c a wild olive-tree should be planted near the hives, to protect them with its %0a%3c shade. Varro says also, De Re Rust. iii. 16, that the bee extracts honey %0a%3c from the olive-tree; but according to Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. ix. c. 64, %0a%3c it is from the leaf, and not the flower of that tree that the honey is ex¬ %0a%3c tracted. %0a%3c %0a%3c See B. XV. c. 31. Fee is inclined to doubt the correctness of the %0a%3c assertion here made by Pliny. %0a%3c %0a%3c ■* See B. xiv. c. 5. The remedies for the diseases of bees in modem %0a%3c times are of a very similar nature, but attention is equally paid to the %0a%3c proper ventilatiou of the hives. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 44.^ %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c POISONEP HONEY. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 341 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c There is a village, called Hostilia, on the banks of tbe river %0a%3c Padus : the inhabitants of it, when food” fails the bees in their %0a%3c vicinity, place the hives in boats and convey them some five %0a%3c miles up the river in the night. In the morning the bees go %0a%3c forth to feed, and then return to the boats; their locality %0a%3c being changed from day to day, until at last, as the boats sink %0a%3c deeper and deeper in the water, it is ascertained that the hives %0a%3c are full, upon which they are taken home, and the honey is %0a%3c withdrawn. %0a%3c %0a%3c (13.) In Spain, too, for the same purpose, they have the %0a%3c hives carried from place to place on the backs of mules. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 44.— POISONED HONEY, AND THE REMEDIES TO BE EMPLOYED %0a%3c BY THOSE WHO HAVE EATEN OF IT. %0a%3c %0a%3c Indeed, the food of bees is of the very greatest importance, %0a%3c as it is owing to this that we meet with poisonous’* honey %0a%3c even. At Heraclia” in Pontus, the honey is extremely perni¬ %0a%3c cious in certain years, though it is the same bees that make %0a%3c it at other times. Authors, however, have not informed us %0a%3c from W'hat flowers this honey is extracted ; we shall, therefore, %0a%3c take this opportunity of stating what we have ascertained %0a%3c upon the subject. %0a%3c %0a%3c There is a certain plant which, from the circumstance that %0a%3c it proves fatal to beasts of burden, and to goats in particular, %0a%3c has obtained the name of “ segolethron,” ” and the blossoms of %0a%3c %0a%3c This plan is still adopted on the river Po, the ancient Padus, as also %0a%3c at Beauce, in the south of France, where the hives are carried from place %0a%3c to place upon carts. In the north of England it is the practice to carry %0a%3c the hives to the moors in autumn. %0a%3c %0a%3c ’* This has been doubted by Spielmann, but it is nevertheless the truth; %0a%3c the nature of the susrar secreted by the glands of the nectary, being ana¬ %0a%3c logous to that of the” plant wliich furnishes it. The honey gathered from %0a%3c aconite in Switzerland has been known to produce vertigo and even deli¬ %0a%3c rium. Dr. Barton also gives a similar account of the effects of the poisonous %0a%3c honey collected from the Kalmia latifolia in Pennsylvania; and Geofifroi %0a%3c Saint Hilaire says that, having eaten in Brazil some honey prepared by a %0a%3c wasp called “ lecheguana,” his life was put in very considerable danger %0a%3c thereby. Xenophon also speaks of the effects of the intoxicating or mad¬ %0a%3c dening honey upon some of the Ten Thousand in their retreat. %0a%3c %0a%3c ” The rhododendrons and rose laurels. Fee says, which are so numerous %0a%3c in these parts, render the fact here stated extremely probable. %0a%3c %0a%3c ” “ Goats’ death.” Fee says that this is the Ehododendron Ponticum %0a%3c of Linnajus.

There are numerous remedies, of which %0a%3c we shall have occasion to speak in a more appropriate place %0a%3c but as it will be as well to mention some of them on the pre¬ %0a%3c sent occasion, by way of being provided for such insidious acci¬ %0a%3c dents, I will here state that old honied wine is good, mixed %0a%3c with the finest honey and rue; salt meats, also, taken re¬ %0a%3c peatedly in small quantities, and as often brought up again. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is a well-known fact that dogs, after tasting the excre¬ %0a%3c tions of persons suffering from these attacks, have been at¬ %0a%3c tacked with similar symptoms, and have experienced the same %0a%3c kind of pains. %0a%3c %0a%3c Still, however, it is equally well ascertained, that honied %0a%3c wine prepared from this honey, when old, is altogether innoxi¬ %0a%3c ous ; and that there is nothing better than this honey, mixed %0a%3c with costus,’® for softening the skin of females, or, combined %0a%3c with aloes, for the treatment of bruises. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 45. -MADDENING HONEY. %0a%3c %0a%3c In the country of the Sanni, in the same part of Pontus, %0a%3c there is another kind of honey, which, from the madness it %0a%3c produces, has received the name of “maenomenon.”” This %0a%3c evil effect is generally attributed to the flowers of the rhodo¬ %0a%3c dendron,®® with which the woods there abound; and that people, %0a%3c though it pays a tribute to the Homans in wax, derives no %0a%3c profit whatever from its honey, in consequence of these dan¬ %0a%3c gerous properties. In Persis, too, and in Gmtulia, a district %0a%3c %0a%3c In reality, there are no visible signs by which to detect that the honey %0a%3c is poisonous. %0a%3c %0a%3c B-. xxix. c. 31. ’s See B. xii. c. 25. %0a%3c %0a%3c Wawofitvov, “maddening.” %0a%3c %0a%3c The aegolethron of the preceding Chapter, Fee thinks.

What can %0a%3c we suppose to have possibly been the intention of Nature in %0a%3c thus laying these traps in our way, giving us honey that is %0a%3c poisonous in some years and good in others, poisonous in some %0a%3c parts of the combs and not in others, and that, too, the produce %0a%3c in all cases of the self-same bees ? It was not enough, forsooth, %0a%3c to have produced a substance in which poison might be admi¬ %0a%3c nistered without the sliglitest difficulty, but must she herself %0a%3c administer it as well in the honey, to fall in the way of so %0a%3c many animated beings ? What, in fact, can have been her %0a%3c motive, except to render mankind a little more cautious and %0a%3c somewhat less greedy ? %0a%3c %0a%3c And has she not provided the very bees, too, with pointed %0a%3c weapons, and those w'eapons poisoned to boot ? So it is, and %0a%3c I shall, therefore, without delay, set forth the remedies to %0a%3c counteract the effects of their stings. It will be found a very %0a%3c excellent plan to foment the part stung with the juice of mal¬ %0a%3c lows®* or of ivy leaves, or else for the person who has been stuug %0a%3c to take these juices in drink. It is a verj^ astonishing thing, %0a%3c however, that the insects which thus carry these poisons in %0a%3c their mouths and secrete them, should never die themselves %0a%3c in consequence; unless it is that Nature, that mistress of all %0a%3c things, has given to bees the same immunity from the eflects %0a%3c of poison w'hich she has granted against the attacks of serpents %0a%3c to the Psylli®® and the Marsi among men. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 46.

The best hives are %0a%3c those made of bark, the next best those of fennel-giant, and the %0a%3c next of osier: many persons, too, have them made of mirror- %0a%3c stone,®® for the purpose of watching®^ the bees at work within. %0a%3c It is the best plan to anoint the hives all over with cow-dung. %0a%3c The lid of the hive should be made to slide from behind, so as %0a%3c to admit of being shut to within, in case the hive should prove %0a%3c too large or their labours unproductive; for, if this is not %0a%3c done, the bees are apt to become discouraged and abandon %0a%3c their work. The slide may then be gradually withdrawn, the %0a%3c increase of space being imperceptible to the bees as the work %0a%3c progresses. In winter, too, the hives should be covered with %0a%3c straw, and subjected to repeated fumigations, with burnt cow- %0a%3c dung more particularly. As this is of kindred®® origin with %0a%3c the bees, the smoke produced by it is particularly beneficial in %0a%3c killing all such insects as may happen to breed there, such as %0a%3c spiders, for instance, moths,®® and wood-worms ;®® while, at the %0a%3c same time, it stimulates the bees themselves to increased acti¬ %0a%3c vity. In fact, there is little difficulty in getting rid of the %0a%3c spiders, but to destroy the moths, which are a much greater %0a%3c plague, a night must be chosen in spring, just when the mal¬ %0a%3c low is ripening, there being no moon, but a clear sky: fiam- %0a%3c beaux are then lighted before the hives, upon which the moths %0a%3c precipitate themselves in swarms into the flame. %0a%3c %0a%3c F^e remarks here that Pliny is right, and that Columella and Palla- %0a%3c dius are wrong, who would have the hives to look due north. %0a%3c %0a%3c Lapis specularis ; a sort of talc, probably.

THE BEST KINDS %0a%3c OF WAX. PUNIC WAX. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Wax is made®® from the honeycombs after the honey has %0a%3c been extracted. For this purpose, they are first cleaned with %0a%3c water, and then dried three days in the shade : on the fourth %0a%3c day they are melted on the fire in a new earthen vessel, with %0a%3c sufficient water to cover them, after which the liquor is strained %0a%3c off in a wdcker basket.®’ The wax is then boiled again with %0a%3c the same water and in the same pot, and poured into vessels of %0a%3c cold water, the interior of which has been well rubbed with %0a%3c honey. The best wax is that known as Punic®® wax, the next %0a%3c best being that of a remarkably yellow colour, with the smell %0a%3c of honey. This last comes from Pontus, and, to my surprise, %0a%3c it is in no way affected by the poisonous honey which it has %0a%3c Honeycombs and rough wax are placed in the hive, when the bees %0a%3c are in want of aliment; also honey and sugar-sirop. %0a%3c %0a%3c 9- “Defrutum:” grape-juice boiled down to one-halt. %0a%3c %0a%3c 93 Fee is at a loss to know how this could be of any service as an ali¬ %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ment to bees. %0a%3c %0a%3c »‘ A mere puerility, Fee says. , , , %0a%3c %0a%3c 95 But extremely weak, no doubt; for after boiling, the hydromel must %0a%3c be subjected, first to vinous, and then to acetous, fermentation. %0a%3c %0a%3c 95 The method here described difters but little from that employed at %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c the present day. %0a%3c 9’ “ Sporta.” %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 9« Or Carthaginian. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 346 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c flint’s natural history. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Rook XX r. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c contained.®® The next in quality is the Cretan wax, which %0a%3c contains the largest proportion of propolis,^ a substance of %0a%3c which we have previously made mention when treating of %0a%3c bees. Next to these varieties comes the Corsican wax, which, %0a%3c being the produce of the box-tree, is generally thought to bo %0a%3c possessed of certain medicinal properties. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Punic wax is prepared in the following manner : yellow %0a%3c wax is first blanched in the open air, after which it is boiled %0a%3c in water from the open sea, with the addition of some nitre.® %0a%3c The fiower of the wax, or, in other words, the whitest part of %0a%3c it, is then skimmed off with spoons, and poured into a vessel %0a%3c containing a little cold water. After this, it is again boiled %0a%3c in sea-water by itself, which done, the vessel is left to cool. %0a%3c When this operation has been three times repeated, the wax is %0a%3c left in the open air upon a mat of rushes, to dry in the light of %0a%3c the sun and moon; for while the latter adds to its whiteness, %0a%3c the sun helps to dry® it. In order, however, that it may not %0a%3c melt, it is the practice to cover it with a linen cloth : if, when %0a%3c it has been thus refined, it is boiled once more, the result is a %0a%3c wax of the greatest possible whiteness. %0a%3c %0a%3c Punic wax is considered the best for all medicinal prepara¬ %0a%3c tions. Wax is made black by the addition of ashes of pa¬ %0a%3c pyrus, and a red colour is given to it by the admixture of al- %0a%3c kanet; indeed, by the employment of various pigments, it is %0a%3c made to assume various tints, in which state it is used for %0a%3c making models,and for other purposes without number, %0a%3c among which we may mention varnishing walls® and armour, %0a%3c to protect them from the air.

The “sweet-root;” our liquorice. The Gly- %0a%3c cyrrhiza echinata of Linnaeus bears a prickly fruit; it is of this. Fee %0a%3c thinks, that Pliny speaks here. %0a%3c %0a%3c Fee remarks, that though the leaf of the nettle is furnished with %0a%3c numerous stings, or rather prickly hairs, it is quite wrong to look upon %0a%3c them as tliorns, which Pliny, in the present instance, (though not in %0a%3c tlie next Chapter) appears to do. Genuine thorns, he remarks, are abortive %0a%3c branches, which, of course, cannot be said of the fine hairs springing from %0a%3c the nerves of the leaf. See B.xxii. c. 15. %0a%3c %0a%3c ®® Supposed to be the Tribulus terrestris of Linnaeus, a species of thistle : %0a%3c the leaves of this plant, however, are not provided, Fee remarks, with %0a%3c thorns at their base, the fruit alone being spinous.

See B. xxii. c. 15. %0a%3c %0a%3c “ Canina.” A variety, probably, of the Urtica urens, the nettle, with %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 352 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Pliny's natural histout. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XXI. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c worst, the stem of it even possessing that property ; the leaves %0a%3c of the nettle are indented at the edge. There is one kind %0a%3c also, which emits a smell, known as the Herculanean” nettle. %0a%3c The seed of all the nettles is copious, and black. It is a sin¬ %0a%3c gular fact that, though possessed of no spinous points, the %0a%3c down®® of the nettle is of a noxious nature, and that, though %0a%3c ever so lightly touched, it will immediately produce an itch¬ %0a%3c ing sensation, and raise a blister on the flesh similar in ap« %0a%3c pearance to a burn : the well-known remedy for it is olive oil. %0a%3c %0a%3c The stinging property of the nettle does not belong to the %0a%3c plant at the earliest period of its growth, but only developes %0a%3c itself under the influence of the sun. The plant first begins %0a%3c to grow in the spring, at which period it is by no means a %0a%3c disagreeable food indeed, it has become quite a religious ob¬ %0a%3c servance to employ it as such, under the impression that it is %0a%3c a preventive from diseases the whole year through. The root, %0a%3c too, of the wild nettle, has the effect of rendering all meat %0a%3c more tender that is boiled withit.®® The kind that is innoxious %0a%3c and destitute of all stinging properties, is known as the “ la- %0a%3c mium.” Of the scorpio®* we shall have occasion to speak %0a%3c when treating of the medicinal plants. %0a%3c %0a%3c the exception of the TJrtica pilifera, which has the most stin^ng proper¬ %0a%3c ties of all those found in Europe, and the leaves of which are the most %0a%3c deeply indented. %0a%3c %0a%3c This has not been identified. They are all of them either inodorous, %0a%3c or else possessed of a faint, disagreeable smell. %0a%3c %0a%3c This “ lanugo,” or down, as he calls it, consists of a fine elongated %0a%3c tube of cellular tissue, seated upon a gland of similar tissue. In this %0a%3c gland a poisonous fluid is secreted, and when any pressure is made upon %0a%3c the gland, the fluid passes upwards in the tube. The nettle of the East, %0a%3c known as the Devil’s Leaf, is of so poisonous a quality as to produce %0a%3c death. %0a%3c %0a%3c In some parts of the north of England and of Scotland the young %0a%3c plant of the Urtica dioica is eaten as greens, and is far from a disagreeable %0a%3c dish, strongly resembling spinach. It is also reckoned a very wholesome %0a%3c diet, and is taken habitually in the spring, under the impression that it %0a%3c purifies the blood. This notion, we see from the context, is as old as the %0a%3c time of the Eomans. %0a%3c %0a%3c Dalechamps speaks of it as the custom in his time to wrap up fish %0a%3c and game in nettles, under the impression that they would keep the longer %0a%3c for it. %0a%3c %0a%3c The dead nettle, or blind nettle.

I’he bulbs %0a%3c of it are like moderately-sized turnips, and there is no plant %0a%3c the root of which has more of them, as many as eighty bulbs %0a%3c being often grouped together. Theophrastus, and nearly all %0a%3c the Greek writers, with Pythagoras at the head of them, have %0a%3c given the name of “ anthericos ” to its stem, which is one cubit, %0a%3c and often two, in length, the leaves being very similar to those %0a%3c of the wild leek ; it is to the root, or in other words, the bulbs, %0a%3c that they have given the name of asphodel. The people of our %0a%3c country call this plant “ albucus,” and they give the name %0a%3c of “ royal spear ” to the asphodel the stem of which bears %0a%3c berries,^® thus distinguishing two varieties of it. The albu- %0a%3c cus has a stalk a cubit in length, large, naked, and smooth, in %0a%3c reference to which, Mago recommends that it should be cut at %0a%3c the end of March and the beginning of April, the period at %0a%3c which it blossoms, and before the seed has begun to swell; he %0a%3c says, too, that the stalks should be split, and exposed on the %0a%3c fourth day in the sun, after which, when dry, they should be %0a%3c made up into bundles. %0a%3c %0a%3c The same author states, also, that the Greeks give the name %0a%3c of “pistana” to the aquatic plant known to us as the “ sa- %0a%3c gitta and he recommends that it should be stripped of its %0a%3c bark, and dried in a mild sun, between the ides of May®^ and %0a%3c the end of October. He says, too, that it is usual to cut down %0a%3c to the root, throughout all the month of July, the variety of %0a%3c the gladiolus called “cypiros,” which is a marsh-plant also, %0a%3c and at the end of three days to dry it in the sun, until it turns %0a%3c white; but that care must be taken ever)' day to carry it under %0a%3c cover before sunset, the night dews being very injurious to %0a%3c marsh plants when cut. %0a%3c %0a%3c Od. xi. 539, and xxiv. 13. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is difficult to say to what “ illud” refers, if, indeed, it is the correct %0a%3c reading. %0a%3c %0a%3c “ Hastula regia.” 28 « Caulis acinosi.” %0a%3c %0a%3c 23 See B. xxii. c. 32. %0a%3c %0a%3c 8 ® “Arrow.” The Sagittaria sagittifolia of Linna 5 us; our arrow-head, %0a%3c or adder’s tongue. 3 i 15 th of May. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 09.] THE BUSH. 301 %0a%3c %0a%3c CBAP. 69.

He describes a second kind, also, which I find is %0a%3c generally called the “ marine" rush, and is known to the %0a%3c Greeks as the “ oxyschcenos.”®^ %0a%3c %0a%3c Generally speaking, there are three varieties of this last %0a%3c rush: the pointed rush, which is barren, and by the Greeks %0a%3c is called the male rush and the “ oxys the female rush,®® %0a%3c which bears a black seed, and is called the “ melancranis,”*’ %0a%3c thicker and more bushy than the preceding one : and a third %0a%3c kind, called the “ holoschoenus,”®® which is larger still. Of %0a%3c these varieties, the melancranis grows separately from the %0a%3c others, but the oxys and the holoschoenus will grow upon the %0a%3c self-same clod. The holoschoenus is the most useful for all %0a%3c kinds of basket-work, being of a particularly supple and fleshy %0a%3c nature; it bears a fruit, which resembles eggs attached to one %0a%3c another. The rush, again, which we have spoken of as the %0a%3c male rush,®® is reproduced from itself, the summit of it being %0a%3c bent down into the earth ; the melancranis, however, is propa¬ %0a%3c gated from seed. Beyond this, the roots of all the varieties of %0a%3c the rush die every year. %0a%3c %0a%3c The rush is in general use for making kipes for sea-fishing. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Schoenus mariscus of Linnaeus. %0a%3c %0a%3c Pliny is guilty of a lapsus memoriae here, for he has nowhere given %0a%3c any such advice on the subject.

The cypiros of Crete is %0a%3c white, with an odour strongly resembling that of nard; tlie %0a%3c produce of Naxos has a more pungent smell, that of Phoenicia %0a%3c but little odour of any kind, and that of JEg}q;)t none at all; %0a%3c for it grows in that country as well. %0a%3c %0a%3c This plant disperses hard tumours of the body—for we shall %0a%3c here begin to speak of the remedies derived from the various %0a%3c flowers and odoriferous plants, they being, all of them, of very %0a%3c considerable utility in medicine.

He entertains no doubt, however, that it is pro¬ %0a%3c ductive of abortion, and he mentions, as a remarkable fact, %0a%3c that the barbarians,^^ by inhaling the fumes of this plant at %0a%3c the mouth, thereby diminish the volume of the spleen.

The %0a%3c lower leaves are more slender than those of the leek, and those %0a%3c at the top are small, with the seed of the plant lying betAveen %0a%3c them.

The petals are dried, or else the %0a%3c juice is extracted from them, by one of the three following %0a%3c methods: Either the leaves are employed whole for the pur¬ %0a%3c pose, the unglets not being removed—for these are the parts, %0a%3c in fact, that contain the most juice—or else the unglets are %0a%3c first taken ofi" and the residue is then macerated with oil or %0a%3c wine, in glass vessels placed in the sun. Some persons add %0a%3c salt as well, and others alkanet,®^ or else aspalathus or sweet- %0a%3c scented rush ; as it is, when thus prepared, a veiy valuable re¬ %0a%3c medy for diseases of the uterus and for dysentery. According %0a%3c to the third process, the unglets are removed from the petals, %0a%3c and pounded, after which they are subjected to pressure in a %0a%3c coarse linen cloth, the juice being received in a copper vessel.; %0a%3c it is then boiled on a slow fire, until it has acquired the con¬ %0a%3c sistence of honey; for this purpose, however, the most odori¬ %0a%3c ferous of the petals should be selected. %0a%3c %0a%3c (19.) We have already stated,®^ when speaking of the va¬ %0a%3c rious kinds of wines, how rose wine is made. Hose juice is %0a%3c much used in injections for the ears, and as a gargle for ulcer¬ %0a%3c ations of the mouth, and for the gums and tonsils; it is em¬ %0a%3c ployed also for the stomach, maladies of the uterus, diseases %0a%3c of the rectum, and for head-ache. In fevers, it is used, either %0a%3c by itself or in combination with vinegar, as a remedy for %0a%3c sleeplessness and nausea. The petals, charred, are used, as a %0a%3c cosmetic for the eyebrows and the thighs, when chafed, are %0a%3c rubbed with them dried; reduced to powder, too, they are %0a%3c soothing for defiuxions of the eyes. The fiower of the rose is %0a%3c soporific, and taken in oxycrate it arrests fluxes in females, %0a%3c the white flux in particular ; also spitting of blood, and pains %0a%3c in the stomach, if taken in three cyathi of wine, in sufficient %0a%3c quantity to flavour it. %0a%3c %0a%3c As to the seed of the rose, the best is that which is of a saf¬ %0a%3c fron colour, and not more than a year old ; it should be dried, %0a%3c %0a%3c 52 “Ungues,” “nails;” in allusion to the white part of the finger¬ %0a%3c nails. “ Cortex.” %0a%3c %0a%3c 55 “Anchusam.” ®® In B. xiv. c. 19. %0a%3c %0a%3c 55 “ In calliblepharum.” %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 3G6 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c plixy’s natural history. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XXI. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c too, in tlie shade. The black seed is worthless. In cases of %0a%3c tootli-ache, the seed is employed in the form of a liniment; it %0a%3c acts also as a diuretic, and is used as a topical application for %0a%3c the stomach, as also in cases of erysipelas which are not in¬ %0a%3c veterate : inhaled at the nostrils, it has the effect of clearing %0a%3c the brain. The lieads of roses, taken in drink, arrest looseness of %0a%3c the bowels and hsemorrhage. The unglets of the rose are %0a%3c wholesome in cases of defluxion of the eyes; hut the rose is %0a%3c very apt to taint all ulcerous sores of the eyes, if it is not ap¬ %0a%3c plied at the very beginning of the defluxion, dried, and in %0a%3c combination with bread. The petals, too, taken internally, aro %0a%3c extremely wholesome for gna^sdng pains of the stomach, and %0a%3c for maladies of the abdomen or intestines ; as also for the tho¬ %0a%3c racic organs, if applied externally even: they are preserved, too, %0a%3c for eating, in a similar manner to lapathum. Great care must %0a%3c be taken in drying rose-leaves, as they are apt to turn mouldy %0a%3c very quickly. %0a%3c %0a%3c The petals, too, from which the juice has been extracted, %0a%3c may be put to some use when dried : powders,®^ for instance, %0a%3c may be made from them, for the piu’pose of cheeking the per¬ %0a%3c spiration. These powders are sprinkled on the body, upon %0a%3c leaving the bath, and are left to dry on it, after which they are %0a%3c washed off with cold water. The little excrescences®® of %0a%3c the wild rose, mixed with bears’-grease,®® are a good remedy %0a%3c for alopecy. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 74.- TWENTT-ONE REMEDIES DERIVED FROM THE LILY. %0a%3c %0a%3c The roots of the lily®®* ennoble that flower in manifold ways %0a%3c by their utility in a medicinal point of view.

The bulbs of the lily contain a mucilage, %0a%3c and roasted or boiled they are sometimes employed. Fee says, to bring in¬ %0a%3c flammations to a head. Employed internally, he thinks that they would %0a%3c be of no use whatever, and there is nothing in their composition, he says, %0a%3c wliich would induce one to think that they might be employed to advan¬ %0a%3c tage in most of the cases mentioned by Pliny. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 75.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c THE NABCISSUS. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 367 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ia ■wine, not being taken off before the end of three days.

Boiled %0a%3c in wine and applied with honey, they are curative of wounds %0a%3c of the sinews. They are good, too, for lichens, leprous sores, %0a%3c and scurf upon the face, and they efface wrinkles of the body. %0a%3c %0a%3c The petals of the lily are boiled in vinegar, and applied, in %0a%3c combination with polium,“ to wounds; if it should happen, %0a%3c however, to be a wound of the testes, it is the best plan to %0a%3c apply the other ingredients with henbane and wheat-meaL %0a%3c Lily-seed is applied in cases of erysipelas, and the flowers and %0a%3c leaves are used as a cataplasm for inveterate ulcers. The %0a%3c juice which is extracted from the flower is called “ honey”®^ %0a%3c by some persons, and “syrium” by others ; it is employed as %0a%3c an emollient for the uterus, and is also used for the purpose of %0a%3c promoting perspirations, and for bringing suppurations to a %0a%3c head. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 75. —SIXTEEN EESIEDIES DERIVED FROM: THE NARCISSUS. %0a%3c %0a%3c Two varieties of ihe narcissus arc employed in medicine, %0a%3c the one wdth a purple®^ flower, aud the herbaceous narcissus.®^ %0a%3c This last is injurious to the stomach, and hence it is that it %0a%3c acts both as an emetic and as a purgative: it is prejudicial, %0a%3c also, to the sinews, and produces dull, heavy pains in the head: %0a%3c hence it is that it has received its name, from “ narce,”®* and %0a%3c not from the youth Ivarcissus, mentioned in fable. The roots of %0a%3c both kinds of narcissus have a flavour resembling that of wine %0a%3c mixed with honey. This plant is very useful, applied to %0a%3c burns w'ith a liltle honey, as also to other kinds of wounds, %0a%3c and sprains. Applied topically, too, with honey and oatmeal, %0a%3c it is good for tumours, and it is similarly employed for the %0a%3c extraction of foreign substances from the body. %0a%3c %0a%3c Beaten up in polenta and oil it effects the cure of contu¬ %0a%3c sions and blows inflicted by stones ; and, mixed with meal. %0a%3c %0a%3c Or “ Poley.” See c. 21 of this Book. %0a%3c %0a%3c 61 “Mel.” ®^ See c. 12 of this Book. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Narcissus pseudo-narcissus of Linnaeus, the meadow narcissus, %0a%3c or daffodil.

Of this flower oil of narcissus is %0a%3c made, good for softening indurations of the skin, and for warm¬ %0a%3c ing parts of the body that have been frost-bitten. It is very %0a%3c beneficial, also, for the ears, but is very apt to« produce %0a%3c head-ache. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 76.- SEVENTEEN REMEUIES DERIVED FROM THE VIOLET. %0a%3c %0a%3c There are both Avild and cultivated violets.® The purple %0a%3c violet is of a cooling nature: for inflammations they are ap¬ %0a%3c plied to the stomach in the burning heats, and for pains in the %0a%3c head they are applied to the forehead. Violets, in particular, %0a%3c are used for defluxions of the eyes, prolapsus of the fundament %0a%3c and uterus, and suppurations. Worn in chaplets upon the %0a%3c head, or even smelt at, they dispel the fumes of wine and head- %0a%3c acl\e ; and, taken in water, they are a cure for quinsy. The %0a%3c purple violet, taken in water, is a remedy for epilepsy, in %0a%3c children more particularl}?^; violet seed is good for the stings %0a%3c of scorpions. %0a%3c %0a%3c On the other hand, the flower of the white violet opens sup¬ %0a%3c purations, and the plant itself disperses them. Both the white %0a%3c and the yellow violet check the menstrual discharge, and act %0a%3c as diuretics. When fresh gathered, they have less virtue, and %0a%3c hence it is that they are mostly used dry, after being kept a %0a%3c year. The yellow violet, taken in doses of half a cyathus to %0a%3c three cyathi of water, promotes the catamenia; and the roots %0a%3c of it, applied with vinegar, assuage affections of the spleen, as %0a%3c also the gout. Mixed with myrrh and safitron, they are good %0a%3c for inflammation of the eyes. The leaves, applied with honey, %0a%3c cleanse ulcerous sores of the head, and, combined with cerate,® %0a%3c they are good for chaps of the fundament and other moist parts %0a%3c of the body. Employed with Aunegar, they effect the cure of %0a%3c . abscesses. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 77.-SEVENTEEN REMEDIES DERIVRD FROM THE BACCHAB. %0a%3c %0a%3c ONE REMEDY DERIVED FROM THE COMBRETUM. %0a%3c %0a%3c The bacchar that is used in medicine is by some.of our %0a%3c writers called the “ perpressa.” It is very useful for the stings %0a%3c of serpents, head-ache and burning heats in the head, and %0a%3c %0a%3c See c. 14 of this Book. %0a%3c %0a%3c .

It is %0a%3c found very beneficial to administer a decoction of the root for %0a%3c spasms, falls with violence, convulsions, and asthma. For an %0a%3c inveterate cough, three or four roots of this plant are boiled %0a%3c down to one-third; this decoction acting also as a purgative %0a%3c for women after miscarriage, and removing stitch in the side, %0a%3c and calculi of the bladder. Drying powders®® for perspiration %0a%3c are prepared also from this plant; and it is laid among gar¬ %0a%3c ments for the smell.*® The combretum which we have spoken™ %0a%3c of as resembling the bacchar, beaten up with axle-grease, is a %0a%3c marvellous cure for wounds. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 78.- EIGHT EEMEDIES DEMVED FROM ASAEIJM. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is generally stated that asarum™ is good for aflFections of %0a%3c the liver, taken in doses of one ounce to a semisextarius of %0a%3c honied wine mixed with water. It purges the bowels like %0a%3c hellebore, and is good for dropsy and aflections of the thoracic %0a%3c organs and uterus, as also for jaundice. When mixed with %0a%3c must, it makes a wine with strongly diuretic qualities. It %0a%3c is taken up as soon as it begins to put forth its leaves, and is %0a%3c dried in the shade.

It acts as an emmenagogue, and is %0a%3c generally taken in wine. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 81. -TWENTY EEMEDIES DERIVED FROM SAFFRON. %0a%3c %0a%3c Saffron does not blend well with honey, or, indeed, with any %0a%3c sweet substance, though very readily with wine or water: it %0a%3c is extremely useful in medicine, and is generally kept in horn %0a%3c boxes. Applied with egg it disperses all kinds of inflamma¬ %0a%3c tion, those of the eyes in particular : it is employed also for %0a%3c hysterical suffocations, and for ulcerations of the stomach, chest, %0a%3c kidneys, liver, lungs, and bladder. It is particularly useful %0a%3c also in cases of inflammation of those parts, and for cough and %0a%3c pleurisy. It likewise removes itching’® sensations, and acts as %0a%3c a diuretic. Persons who have used the precaution of first %0a%3c taking saffron in drink will never experience surfeit or head¬ %0a%3c ache, and will be proof against inebriation. Chaplets too, %0a%3c made of saffron, and worn on the head, tend to dispel the fumes %0a%3c of wine. The flower of it is employed topically with Cimo- %0a%3c lian’® chalk for erysipelas.

It is ver)’’ bene¬ %0a%3c ficial to attach this plant to the bodies of infants more par¬ %0a%3c ticularly when they are cutting their teeth, or are suffering %0a%3c from cough; it is equally good, too, to inject a few drops of it %0a%3c when children are suffering from tape-worm. The other pro¬ %0a%3c perties of it differ but very little from those of honey. It %0a%3c cleanses ulcerous sores of the head, and inveterate abscesses %0a%3c more particularly. Taken in doses of two drachmae with honey, %0a%3c it relaxes the bowels; and an infusion of it is good for cough, %0a%3c gripings of the stomach, and flatulency : taken with vinegar, %0a%3c too, it cures affections of the spleen. Mixed with oxycrate it %0a%3c is good for the bites of serpents and spiders, and, in doses of %0a%3c two drachmae with bread or water, it is employed for the cure %0a%3c of the stings of scorpions. It is applied also topically with oil %0a%3c to the bites of dogs, and to parts that are excoriated: employed %0a%3c in a similar manner, too, it is good for pains in the sinews, and %0a%3c in combination with resin it is used as a liniment for lumbago %0a%3c and sciatica. The properties of this plant are of a warming %0a%3c nature. Inhaled at the nostrils, it produces sneezing and %0a%3c cleanses the brain, and in cases of head-ache it is applied to¬ %0a%3c pically in combination with the quince or the strutheum.’® It %0a%3c dispels the fumes of wine also, and difficulties of breathing*^ %0a%3c and taken in doses of two oboli it acts as an emetic: applied %0a%3c as a plaster with honey, it extracts splinters of broken bones. %0a%3c Powdered iris is employed also for whitlows, and, mixed with %0a%3c wine, for corns and warts, in which case it is left for three days %0a%3c on the part affected. %0a%3c %0a%3c Chewed, it is a corrective of bad breath and offensive exha¬ %0a%3c lations of the arm-pits, and the juice of it softens all kinds of %0a%3c indurations of the body. This plant acts as a soporific, but it %0a%3c wastes the seminal fluids : it is used also for the treatment of %0a%3c chaps of the fundament and condylomata, and it heals all sorts %0a%3c of excrescences on the body. %0a%3c %0a%3c A small kind of quince.

They say, too, that it should be kept about the %0a%3c person as an antidote to poison, and that to keep serpents away it %0a%3c should be strewed beneath the bed, burnt, or else carried on the %0a%3c person; decoctions of it in wine, either fresh-gathered or dried, %0a%3c should be used too as a liniment for the body. Medical men %0a%3c prescribe it in vinegar for affections of the spleen, and in wine %0a%3c for the jaundice; a decoction of it in wine is recommended %0a%3c also for incipient dropsy ; and in this way too, it is employed as a %0a%3c liniment for wounds. This plant has the effect of bringing %0a%3c away the after-birth and the dead foetus, and of dispelling %0a%3c pains in various parts of the body : it empties the bladder also, %0a%3c and is employed in liniments for defluxions of the eyes.

Celebrated authors, %0a%3c too, I find, have asserted that twenty-five grains of the seed of %0a%3c the kind of trefoil which we have®® spoken of as the “ minyan- %0a%3c thes,” are a sufficient antidote for all kinds of poisons; in ad¬ %0a%3c dition to which, there are numerous other remedial virtues %0a%3c ascribed to it. %0a%3c %0a%3c But these notions, in my opinion, are counterbalanced by %0a%3c the authority of a writer of the very highest repute : for wc %0a%3c find the poet Sophocles asserting that the trefoil is a venomous %0a%3c plant. Simus, too, the physician, maintains that a decoction %0a%3c of it, or the juice, poured upon the human body, is productive %0a%3c of burning sensations similar to those experienced by persons %0a%3c when they have been stung by a serpent and have trefoil ap- %0a%3c phed to the wound. It is my opinion, then, that trefoil should %0a%3c never be used in any other capacity than as a counter-poison; %0a%3c for it is not improbable that the venom of this plant has a %0a%3c natural antipathy to all other kinds of poisons, a phaenomenon %0a%3c which has been observed in many other cases as well.

They are, both of %0a%3c them, considered to be extremely beneficial to the sight, whe¬ %0a%3c ther used as an article of food or as a medicament, and to be %0a%3c good for inveterate coughs.

Still, %0a%3c however, these plants must be used in moderation, as they are %0a%3c of a heating nature, for which reason it is that they act so %0a%3c astringently upon the bowels. In cases of ulceration of the %0a%3c intestines, the dose should be one denarius of thyme to one %0a%3c sextarius of oxymel; the same proportions, too, should be taken %0a%3c for pains in the sides, between the shoulder-blades, or in the %0a%3c thoracic organs. Taken Avith oxymel, these plants are used for %0a%3c the cure of intestinal diseases, and a similar draught is admin¬ %0a%3c istered in cases of alienation of the senses and melancholy. %0a%3c %0a%3c Thyme is given also for epilepsy, when the fits come on, the %0a%3c smell of it reviving the patient; it is said, too, that epileptic %0a%3c persons should sleep upon soft thyme. It is good, also, for %0a%3c hardness of breathing, and for asthma and obstructions of the %0a%3c catamenia, A decoction of thyme in water, bailed down to %0a%3c one-third, brings away the dead foetus, and it is given to males %0a%3c with oxymel, as a remedy for flatulency, and in cases of swell¬ %0a%3c ing of the abdomen or testes and of pains in the bladder.

They are both of them %0a%3c bitter, like wormwood. That of Sicily is the most esteemed, %0a%3c and next to it, that of Galatia. The leaves of it are sometimes %0a%3c employed, but it is the seed that possesses the most warming %0a%3c %0a%3c Od. iv. 1. 221. This has been supposed by many commentators to %0a%3c have been opium. The origin of the word is vrj, “ not,” and irtp9og, %0a%3c “giief;” and, as Fee says, it would seem to indicate rather a composition %0a%3c than a plant. Saffron, mandragore, nightshade, and even tea and coffee, %0a%3c have been suggested by the active imaginations of various writers. Fee is %0a%3c of opinion that it is impossible to come to any satisfactory conclusion, but %0a%3c inclines to the belief that either the poppy or a preparation from it, is %0a%3c meant. In confirmation of this opinion, it is a singular fact, that, as Dr. %0a%3c Paris remarks (in his Pharmacologia), the Nepenthes of Homer was ob¬ %0a%3c tained from Thebes in Egypt, and that tincture of opium, or laudanum, %0a%3c has received the name of “Thebaic tincture.” Gorraeus, in his “ Defini- %0a%3c tiones Medic®,” thinks that the herb alluded to is the Inula Campania, %0a%3c or Elceampane, which was also said to have derived its name of %0a%3c “ Heleniuni” from Helen. Dr. Greenhill, in Smith’s Dictionary of An¬ %0a%3c tiquities, inclines to the opinion that it was opium. See the article %0a%3c “ Pharmaceutica.” %0a%3c %0a%3c 1 See c. 34 of this Book. Both of the plants mentioned share the me¬ %0a%3c dicinal properties of wormwood, being stimulants, tonics, anthelmintics, %0a%3c and febrifuges. It would be dangerous, however. Fee says, to administer %0a%3c them in most of the cases mentioned by Pliny, nor would they be good for %0a%3c strangury, or affections of the chest. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 378 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Flint’s natueal histoet. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XXL %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c properties; hence it is, that it is so beneficial for maladies of %0a%3c the sinews,^ for cough, hardness of breathing, convulsions, rup¬ %0a%3c tures, lumbago, and strangury.

It keeps away serpents, and for %0a%3c their stings it is either taken in wine, or else employed in %0a%3c combination with it as a liniment. It is extremely eflBcacious, %0a%3c also, for the stings of those noxious insects by which shivering %0a%3c fits and chills are produced, such as the scorpion and the spider %0a%3c called “ phalangium,”® for example; taken in a potion, it is %0a%3c good for other kinds of poison, as also for shivering fits, how¬ %0a%3c ever produced, and for the extraction of foreign substances ad¬ %0a%3c hering to the flesh; it has the effect, also, of expelling intes¬ %0a%3c tinal worms.

Some persons give the %0a%3c name of “ phrenion” to this plant: there are two species of %0a%3c it; one of which is wild,^ and the other grows on cultivated® %0a%3c spots; though they are, both of them, attached to a sandy %0a%3c soil. Of the cultivated anemone there are numerous varieties ; %0a%3c some, and these are the most abundant, have a scarlet flower, %0a%3c while others, again, have a flower that is purple or else milk- %0a%3c white. The leaves of all these three kinds bear a strong re¬ %0a%3c semblance to parsley, and it is not often that they exceed half %0a%3c a foot in height, the head being very similar to that of aspa¬ %0a%3c ragus. The flower never opens, except while the wind is %0a%3c blowing, a circumstance to which it owes its name.® The wild %0a%3c anemone is larger than the cultivated one, and has broader %0a%3c leaves, with a scarlet flower. %0a%3c %0a%3c Some persons erroneously take the wild anemone to be the %0a%3c same as the argemone,*® while others, again, identify it with %0a%3c the poppy which we have mentioned^ under the name of %0a%3c “rhoeas:” there is, however, a great difference between them, %0a%3c as these two other plants blossom later than the anemone, nor %0a%3c does the anemone possess a juice or a calyx like theirs; besides %0a%3c which, it terminates in a head like that of asparagus. %0a%3c %0a%3c The various kinds of anemone are good for pains and in¬ %0a%3c flammations of the head, diseases of the uterus, and stoppage %0a%3c of the milk in females ; taken, too, in a ptisan, or applied as a %0a%3c pessary in wool, they promote the menstrual discharge.

One %0a%3c of these kinds, bearing scarlet berries with a stone, enclosed %0a%3c in follicules, is by some persons called the “halicacabum,”^" by %0a%3c others the “ callion,” and by the people of our country, the %0a%3c “ vesicaria,” from the circumstance of its being highly bene¬ %0a%3c ficial to the bladder^^ and in cases of calculus. %0a%3c %0a%3c The trychnon is more of a woody shrub than a herb, with %0a%3c large follicules, broad and turbinated, and a large berry within, %0a%3c which ripens in the month of November. A thirdkind, %0a%3c again, has a leaf resembling that of ocimum—but it is not my %0a%3c intention to give an exact description of it, as I am here speak¬ %0a%3c ing of remedies, and not of poisons; for a few drops of the %0a%3c juice, in fact, are quite sufficient to produce insanity. The %0a%3c Greek writers, however, have even turned this property into %0a%3c matter for jesting; for, according to them, taken in doses of %0a%3c one drachma, this plant is productive of delusive and prurient %0a%3c fancies, and of vain, fantastic visions, which vividly present all %0a%3c the appearance of reality: they say, too, that if the dose is %0a%3c doubled, it will produce downright madness, and that any fur¬ %0a%3c ther addition to it, will result in instant death. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is the same plant which the more well-meaning writem %0a%3c have called in their innocence “ dorycnion,”^® from the circum¬ %0a%3c stance that weapons used in battle are poisoned with it—for it %0a%3c grows everywhere—while others, again, who have treated of it %0a%3c %0a%3c The Solamim nigrum of Linnmus, or black night-shade.

With a wonder¬ %0a%3c ful obliviousness of remedies really harmless, they tell us, for¬ %0a%3c sooth, that it is an instantaneous remedy for loose teeth to %0a%3c rinse them with halicacabuin steeped in wine : but at the same %0a%3c time they add the qualification that it must not be kept in the %0a%3c mouth too long, or else delirium will be the result. This, how¬ %0a%3c ever, is pointing out remedies W'ith a vengeance, the employ¬ %0a%3c ment of which will be attended with worse results than the %0a%3c malady itself. %0a%3c %0a%3c There is a third kind^® of halicacahum, that is esteemed as an %0a%3c article of food ; but even though the flavour of it may be pre¬ %0a%3c ferred to garden plants, and although Xenocrates assures us that %0a%3c there is no bodily malady for which the trychnos is not highly %0a%3c beneficial, they are none of them so valuable as to make me %0a%3c think it proper to speak more at length upon the subject, more %0a%3c particularly as there are so many other remedies, which are %0a%3c unattended with danger. Persons who wish to pass themselves %0a%3c off for true prophets, and who know too well how to impose %0a%3c "upon the superstitions of others, take the root of the halicaca¬ %0a%3c hum in drink.
