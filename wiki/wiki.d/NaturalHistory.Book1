text=THE  FIRST  BOOK %0a%0a%0aNATURAL    HISTORY %0a%0a%0aBY  C.  PLINIUS  SECUNDUS. %0a%0a%0aThe  Preface  to  Vespasian\  his  [friend']  C.  Plinius %0aSecundus  sendeth  greeting. %0a%0aHESE    Books,  containing   the %0aHistory   of  Nature,  which  a %0afew   days  since  I  brought  to %0aLight   (a   new    work  among %0athe  Romans,  your  Citizens), %0aI  purpose  by  this  Epistle  of %0amine  to  present   and  conse- %0acrate  unto  you,  most  gentle %0aPrince    (for    this   Title2    ac- %0acordeth  fittest  unto  you,  seeing  that  the  Name  of %0a[Most  mighty3]  sorteth  well  with  the  Age  of  your %0aFather:)  which  haply  might  seem  boldness  and %0apresumption  in  me,  but  that  I  know  how  at  other %0aTimes  you  were  wont  to  have  some  good  Opinion  of %0amy  light  Matters*.    Where,  by  the  Way,  you  must %0agive  me  Leave  to  soften  a  little  the  Verses  which %0a%0a1   Titus.  8  Suavissimm.  3  Maxim-its. %0a%0a"  Namque  tu  solebas, %0aMcas  esse  aliquid putare  nugas" %0a%0a%0a14  Pliny  s  Epistle  to  T.

[BooK  1. %0a%0aI  borrow  of  my  Tent-fellow,  Catullus  (to  this  Term  of  Camps1 %0ayou  are  no  Stranger)  :  for  he,  as  you  know  well,  changing %0athe  former  Syllables  of  his  Verses2,  one  for  another,  made %0ahimself  somewhat  more  harsh  than  he  would  seem  to  be %0aunto  the  fine  Ears  of  his  familiar  Friends,  the  Veranioli  and %0aFabulli.  And  I  would  be  thought  by  this  my  intrusive %0aWriting  to  you,  to  satisfy  one  point,  which,  as  you  com- %0aplained in  your  Answer  of  late  to  another  bold  Letter  of %0amine,  I  had  not  performed,  that  is,  that  all  the  World  might %0asee  (as  it  were  upon  Record)  how  the  Empire  is  managed  by %0ayou  and  your  Father  equally  :  and  notwithstanding  this %0aImperial  Majesty  whereunto  you  are  called,  yet  is  your %0aManner  of  conversing  with  your  old  Friends  affable,  and %0athe  same  that  always  heretofore  it  had  been.  For  although %0ayou  have  triumphed  with  him  for  your  noble  Victories,  ful- %0afilled the  Office  of  Censor,  and  also  six  times  that  of  Consul3, %0ashared  the  Authority  of  Tribune,  Patrons,  and  Protectors  of %0athe  Commons  of  Rome,  together  with  him  :  although,  I  say, %0ayou  have  otherwise  shewed  your  noble  Heart  in  honouring %0aand  gracing  both  the  Court  of  the  Emperor  your  Father, %0aand  also  the  whole  State  of  the  Knights  and  Gentlemen  of %0aRome,  whilst  you  were  Captain  of  the  Guard,  and  Grand %0aMaster  of  his  House  and  royal  Palace  (in  all  which  Places %0ayou  demeaned  yourself  in  respect  to  the  Good  of  the  Com- %0amonwealth), yet  to  all  your  Friends,  and  especially  to  my- %0aself, you  have  borne  the  same  Countenance  as  in  former %0aTimes,  when  we  served  under  the  same  Colours,  and  lodged %0atogether  in  one  Tent.  In  all  the  Greatness  to  which  you  are %0aelevated,  there  is  no  other  Change  seen  in  your  Person  but %0athis  :  That  your  Power  is  now  commensurate  with  your  Will, %0aand  you  are  able  now  to  perform  that  Good  which  you  have %0aever  intended. %0a%0a1  Conterranewn. %0a%0a2  It  seemeth  that  Pliny  read  thus  in  Catullus : %0a%0a"  Tuputare  namque, %0aNugus  esse  aliquid  meas  solebas" %0awhich,  indeed,  was  but  an  hard  composition  and  couching  of  the  words. %0a%0a3  Sexies,  or  rather  Septies;  out  of  Suetonim. %0a%0a%0aBOOK  I.]  Pliny  s  Epistle  to  T.  Vespasian .  15 %0a%0aAnd  however  this  great  Majesty  resplendent  in  you  on %0aevery  Side,  in  regard  of  those  high  Dignities,  may  induce  the %0aWorld  at  large  to  reverence  your  Person,  yet  1  for  my  part %0aam  aided  only  with  the  strength  of  Confidence  to  shew  my %0aDuty  in  a  more  familiar  manner  than  others  :  and,  therefore, %0athis  my  Boldness  you  will  impute  unto  your  own  Courtesy ; %0aand  if  it  be  a  Fault  in  me,  you  will  seek  your  Pardon  from %0ayourself.  I  have  laid  Bashful  ness  aside,  but  to  no  Purpose. %0aFor  although  your  Gentleness  and  Humanity  induce  me  to %0adraw  near  to  your  Presence,  yet  you  appear  in  other  re- %0aspects in  great  Majesty :  for  the  Sublimity  of  your  Mind, %0ayour  high  Attainments,  set  me  as  far  behind  as  if  the  Lictors %0amarched  before  you.  Was  there  ever  any  Man,  whose %0aWords  passed  from  him  more  powerfully,  and  who  more %0atruly  might  be  said  to  flash  forth  as  Lightning  the  Force  of %0aEloquence  ?  What  Tribune  was  ever  known  more  effectu- %0aally to  move  the  People  with  agreeable  Language  ?  How %0aadmirably  you  thundered  out  the  Praise  of  the  worthy  Acts %0aof  your  Father !  What  a  Testimony  of  Love  to  your  Bro- %0ather! How  skilful  in  Poetry!  How  ingeniously  you  find %0ameans  to  imitate  your  Brother1  in  this  respect2!  But  who  is %0aable  boldly  to  give  sufficient  Estimate  of  these  Gifts  ?  How %0amay  any  One  enter  into  the  due  Consideration  of  them  with- %0aout Fear  of  the  exact  Judgment  of  your  Wit,  especially  being %0achallenged  therunto  as  you  are  ?  For  the  case  of  such  as %0apublish  a  Work  in  general  is  unlike  theirs  who  dedicate  it %0aby  Name  to  yourself.  For  had  I  set  forth  this  my  Book %0awithout  any  personal  Dedication,  I  might  have  said,  Sir, %0awhy  should  a  mighty  Commander  and  General3  busy  him- %0aself to  read  such  Matters  ?  These  Treatises  were  written  for %0athe  lower  Classes,  for  rude  Husbandmen  and  Peasants  of %0athe  Country,  for  the  Mass  of  Artisans,  and  those  who  had %0aLeisure  for  studying  them.  Why  should  you  make  yourself %0a%0a1  For  Domitian  Vespasian  was  reputed  an  excellent  Poet. %0a%0a2  The  sense  of  the  passage,  as  seen  by  supplying  the  ellipsis  of  the %0aoriginal,  is  this  :  "  With  what  testimony  of  love  you  set  forth  the  praises %0aof  your  brother  to  the  full." —  Wern.

When  I  first  thought  of  this  Enter- %0aprise of  mine,  I  never  reckoned  you  in  the  Number  of  those %0aJudges  that  should  stoop  to  pass  sentence  upon  these  Writ- %0aings. It  is  a  common  case,  and  incident  to  Men  of  deep %0aLearning,  that  their  Judgment  be  rejected  in  this  behalf. %0aEven  that  illustrious  Orator,  M.  Tullius,  who  for  Wit  and %0aLearning  had  not  his  Fellow,  useth  the  Benefit  of  this %0aLiberty  :  and  (whereat  we  may  well  marvel)  maintaineth  the %0aAction  by  an  Advocate,  taking  Example  (for  his  Defence) %0afrom  Lucilius :  for  in  one  Part  of  his  Works  thus  he  saith, %0a/  wish  not  the  learned  Persius  to  read  these  Books  of  mine ; %0abut  I  prefer  Lcelius  Decimus.  Now  if  such  a  one  as  Lucilius, %0awho  was  the  first  that  durst  control  the  Writings  of  others, %0ahad  reason  thus  to  say ;  if  Cicero  borrowed  the  same  Speech %0ain  his  Treatise  of  the  Republic1,  how  much  greater  Cause %0ahave  I  to  decline  the  Censure  of  a  competent  Judge?  But %0aI  am  cut  off  from  this  refuge,  in  that  I  expressly  make %0achoice  of  you  in  this  Dedication  of  my  Work  :  for  it  is  one %0aThing  to  have  a  Judge,  either  selected  by  Plurality  of %0aVoices,  or  cast  upon  a  Man  by  drawing  Lots  ;  arid  another %0aThing  to  choose  and  nominate  him  from  all  others  :  and %0athere  is  great  Difference  between  that  Provision  which  we %0amake  for  a  Guest  solemnly  bidden  and  invited,  and  the %0asudden  Entertainment  which  is  ready  for  a  Stranger  who %0a%0a1  This  work  of  Cicero,  entitled  "  De  Republica,"  is  more  than  once %0areferred  to  by  Pliny.  The  high  standard  of  morals  which  it  upheld %0acaused  it  to  be  much  respected  by  the  most  eminent  Fathers  of  the  Latin %0aChurch  :  insomuch  that  it  is  thought  to  have  suggested  to  St.  Augustine %0athe  idea  of  his  celebrated  work,  "  De  Civitate  Dei."  During  the.  dark %0aages,  however,  the  Treatise  "  De  Republica  "  was  so  completely  lost,  that %0aupon  the  revival  of  letters,  not  a  single  manuscript  of  it  could  be  any %0awhere  discovered.  At  length,  about  thirty  years  since,  a  large  portion  of %0ait  was  found  by  Angelo  Ma'i,  then  Librarian  of  the  Vatican,  in  a  parch- %0ament manuscript.  The  parchment  had  been  washed,  and  again  used  for %0aa  manuscript ;  but  the  original  writing  was  so  far  from  having  been  en- %0atirely effaced  by  the  ablution,  that  the  large  Roman  letters  were  soon %0arendered  legible  again  by  the  aid  of  a  peculiar  process.  The  recovered %0aportion  of  this  valuable  work,  being  about  one-third  of  the  entire  Trea- %0atise, was  printed  in  London  in  one  volume,  8vo.  1823. —  Wern.

Cato,  that  professed %0aEnemy  of  Ambition,  who  took  as  great  Contentment  in %0athose  Estates  and  Dignities  which  he  refused  as  in  them %0awhich  he  enjoyed,  attained  to  such  a  good  Name  of  upright- %0aness, that  when  in  the  hottest  Contention  about  the  Election %0aof  Magistrates,  they  that  contested  for  these  Offices  put  into %0ahis  Hands  their  Money  upon  Trust,  as  an  Assurance  of  their %0aIntegrity  and  Fidelity  in  this  respect;  they  professed  that  they %0adid  it  in  Testimony  of  their  Opinion  of  his  Equity  and  Inno- %0acence :  whereupon  ensued  that  noble  and  memorable  Exclam- %0aation of  M.  Cicero  in  these  Words  :  "  Oh !  happy  M.  Portius, %0awhom  no  Man  would  ever  venture  to  solicit  to  any  thing %0acontrary  to  right!"  When  L.  Scipio,  surnamed  Asiaticus, %0aappealed  to  the  Tribunes,  and  besought  their  lawful  Favour %0a(among  whom,  C.  Gracchus  was  one,  a  Man  whom  he  took %0afor  his  mortal  Enemy),  he  exclaimed,  "That  his  very  Ene- %0amies, if  they  were  his  Judges,  could  not  choose  but  give  Sen- %0atence on  his  Side."  Thus  every  Man  maketh  him  the  supreme %0aJudge  of  his  Cause,  whom  himself  hath  chosen  :  which  Man- %0aner of  Choice  the  Latins  call  an  Appeal  (Provocatio).  As %0afor  yourself,  who  are  set  in  the  most  eminent  Place,  and %0aendued  with  the  highest  Eloquence  and  deepest  Learning,  it %0ais  no  Wonder  if  those  who  do  their  Duty  unto  you  approach %0awith  the  utmost  Respect  and  Reverence:  in  which  regard, %0aexceeding  Care  above  all  Things  would  be  had,  that  what- %0asoever is  said  or  dedicated  unto  you,  may  become  your  Per- %0ason, and  be  worthy  your  Acceptance.  And  yet  the  Gods %0areject  not  the  humble  Prayers  of  country  Peasants,  yea,  and %0aof  many  Nations,  who  offer  nothing  but  Milk  unto  them  : %0aand  such  as  have  no  Incense,  find  grace  with  the  Oblation %0aof  a  Cake  made  only  of  Meal  and  Salt ;  and  never  was  any %0aMan  blamed  for  his  Devotion  to  the  Gods,  if  he  offered  ac- %0acording to  his  best  Ability. %0a%0aI  may  be  more  challenged  for  my  inconsiderate  Boldness, %0ain  that  I  would  seem  to  present  these  Books  unto  you,  com- %0apiled of  such  slender  Matter  :  for  in  them  can  be  comprised %0ano  great  Ability  (which  otherwise  in  me  was  ever  meagre), %0aneither  admit  they  any  Digressions,  Orations,  and  Discourses, %0a%0a%0a18  Pliny  s  Epistle  to  T.

The  Nature  of  all  Things  in  this  World,  that  is  to %0asay,  Matters  concerning  our  ordinary  Life,  are  here  deli- %0aneated ;  and  that  in  barren  Terms,  without  any  Show  of %0aPhrases :  and  what  I  have  noted  concern  the  commonest %0aPoints  thereof,  so  that  I  am  to  deliver  the  Matter  either %0ain  rustic,  or  foreign,  nay,  even  barbarous  Language,  such %0aas  may  not  well  be  uttered,  but  with  Apology  to  the  Reader. %0aMoreover,  the  Way  that  I  have  pursued  hath  not  been %0atrodden  before  by  other  Writers ;  being  indeed  so  strange, %0athat  no  one  would  willingly  travel  therein.  No  Latin  Author %0aamong  us  hath  hitherto  ventured  upon  the  same  Argument, %0ano  Grecian  whatsoever  hath  handled  all :  and  that  because %0amost  study  rather  to  pursue  Matters  of  Delight  and  Plea- %0asure. It  may  be  confessed,  that  others  have  made  profession %0aof  doing  so,  but  they  have  done  it  with  such  Subtilty  and %0aDeepness,  that  their  Efforts  lie  as  if  buried  in  Darkness.  I, %0atherefore,  take  upon  me  to  gather  a  complete  Body  of  Arts %0aand  Sciences  (which  the  Greeks  call  lyptuxXcwra/ds/og),  that  are %0aeither  altogether  unknown  or  have  been  rendered  doubtful %0athrough  too  great  Refinement  of  Ingenuity ;  other  Matters %0aare  dealt  with  in  such  long  Discourses,  that  they  are  ren- %0adered tedious  to  the  Readers.  It  is  a  difficult  Enterprise %0ato  make  old  Matters  new,  to  give  Authority  and  Credit  to %0aNovelties,  to  polish  that  which  is  obsolete,  to  set  a  Lustre %0aupon  that  which  is  dim,  to  grace  Things  disdained,  to %0aprocure  Belief  to  Matters  doubtful,  and,  in  one  Word,  to %0areduce  all  to  their  own  Nature.  And  to  make  the  Attempt %0aonly,  although  it  be  not  effected,  is  a  fair  and  magnificent %0aEnterprise.  I  am  confidently  of  opinion,  that  the  greatest %0aCredit  belongs  to  those  learned  Men  who  have  forced  their %0aWay  through  all  Difficulties,  and  have  preferred  the  Profit %0aof  instructing  to  the  Grace  of  pleasing,  the  Gratification  of %0amere  Desire  of  pleasing  the  present  Age;  and  this  I  have %0aaimed  at,  not  in  this  Work  only,  but  in  other  of  rny  Books. %0aAnd  I  wonder  at  T.  Livius,  a  very  celebrated  Writer,  who, %0ain  a  Preface  to  one  of  his  Books  of  the  Roman  History, %0a%0a%0aBOOK  I.]          Pliny  s  Epistle  to  T.  Vespasian.  19 %0a%0awhich  he  compiled  from  the  Foundation  of  Rome,  thus  pro- %0atested :  That  he  had  gotten  Glory  enough  by  his  former %0aWriting,  and  might  now  be  at  ease,  but  that  his  Mind  was %0aso  little  able  to  abide  Repose,  that  it  could  not  subsist  but  in %0alabour.  But,  surely,  in  finishing  those  Chronicles,  he  should %0ahave  respected  the  Glory  of  a  People  of  Conquerors,  who %0ahad  advanced  the  Honour  of  the  Roman  Name,  rather  than %0adisplayed  his  own  Praise :  his  Merit  had  been  the  greater  to %0ahave  continued  his  History  for  Love  of  the  Subject,  rather %0athan  his  private  Pleasure;  to  have  preferred  the  Gratification %0aof  Rome  to  his  own  mere  Pleasure.  As  touching  myself %0a(forasmuch  as  Domitius  Piso  saith,  "  That  Books  ought  to  be %0aTreasuries,  and  not  bare  Writings"),  I  will  be  bold  to  say, %0athat  in  Thirty-six  Books  I  have  comprised  20,000  Things %0athat  are  worthy  of  Consideration,  and  these  I  have  collected %0aout  of  about  2000  Volumes  that  I  have  diligently  read  (and %0aof  which  there  are  few  that  Men  otherwise  learned  have %0aventured  to  meddle  with,  for  the  deep  Matter  therein  con- %0atained), and  those  written  by  one  hundred  several  excellent %0aAuthors  ;  besides  a  Multitude  of  other  Matters,  which  either %0awere  unknown  to  our  former  Writers,  or  Experience  has  lately %0aascertained.  And  yet  we  cannot  doubt  but  there  are  many %0aThings  which  we  have  overlooked  :  for  we  are  Men,  and %0aemployed  in  a  Multiplicity  of  Affairs ;  and  we  follow  these %0aStudies  at  vacant  Times;  that  is  to  say,  by  Night  Season %0aonly  ;  so  that  you  may  know,  that  to  accomplish  this  we %0ahave  neglected  no  Time  which  was  due  to  your  Service. %0aThe  Days  we  assign  to  your  Person  ;  we  sleep  only  to  satisfy %0aNature,  contenting  ourselves  with  this  Reward,  that  whilst %0awe  study  (as  Varro  saith)  these  Things,  we  gain  so  many %0aHours  to  our  Life ;  for  surely  we  live  then  only  when  we %0aare  awake.  Considering  those  Occasions  and  Hindrances,  I %0ahad  no  Reason  to  promise  much  ;  but  as  you  have  embol- %0adened me  to  dedicate  my  Books  to  you,  yourself  supply  what- %0aever in  me  is  wanting ;  not  that  I  place  Dependency  on  the %0aWorth  of  the  Work ;  so  much  as  that  by  this  Means  it  will %0abe  better  esteemed,  for  many  Things  there  be  that  appear %0a%0a%0a20  Pliny  s  Epistle  to  1\  Vespasian.  [BooK  I. %0a%0athe  more  precious  only  because  they  are  consecrated  in  the %0asacred  Temples. %0a%0aWe,  indeed,  have  written  of  you  all — your  Father,  your- %0aself, and  your  Brother,  in  an  adequate  Volume,  which  we %0acompiled  touching  the  History  of  our  Times,  beginning  at %0athe  Place  where  Aufidius  Bassus  ended.  If  you  inquire  of %0ame,  Where  that  History  is  ?  I  answer,  That  it  is  long  since %0afinished,  and  by  this  Time  is  justified  and  approved  by  your %0aDeeds :  otherwise  I  was  determined  to  leave  it  unto  my %0aHeir,  and  I  gave  Order  that  it  should  be  published  only %0aafter  my  Death,  to  remove  the  Suspicion  that  it  had  been %0awritten  to  obtain  some  selfish  End.  And  by  so  doing,  I  do %0aboth  them  a  great  Favour,  who,  perhaps,  were  inclined  to %0apublish  the  like  Chronicle ;  and  Posterity,  also,  who,  I  well %0aknow,  will  compete  with  us  as  we  have  done  with  our  Pre- %0adecessors. A  sufficient  Argument  of  this  my  Mind  you  shall %0ahave  by  this,  that  in  the  Front  of  these  Books  now  in  Hand, %0aI  have  set  down  the  Names  of  those  Writers  whose  Help  I %0ahave  used  in  the  compiling  of  them :  for  I  am  of  Opinion, %0athat  it  is  the  Part  of  an  honest  Man,  and  one  that  has  a %0aClaim  to  any  Modesty,  to  confess  by  whom  he  hath  pro- %0afited ;  and  not  as  many  of  those  Persons  have  done,  whom  I %0ahave  alleged  for  my  Authors.  For,  to  tell  you  the  Truth,  in %0aconferring  them  together  about  this  Work  of  mine,  I  have %0amet  with  some  of  our  modern  Writers,  who,  Word  for  Word, %0ahave  copied  out  whole  Books  of  old  Authors,  and  never %0avouchsafed  so  much  as  the  Naming  of  them  ;  but  have  taken %0atheir  Labours  to  themselves.  And  this  they  have  not  done %0ain  the  Spirit  to  imitate  and  match  them,  as  Virgil  did %0aHomer:  much  less  have  they  shewed  the  Simplicity  and %0aOpenness  of  Cicero,  who,  in  his  Books  on  the  Common- %0awealth, professeth  himself  to  follow  Plato;  in  his  consola- %0atory Epistle  written  to  his  Daughter,  he  saith,  "  I  follow %0aCrantor"  and  Pancetius  likewise,  in  his  Treatise  concerning %0aOffices.  Which  Volumes  of  his  (as  you  know  well)  deserve %0anot  only  to  be  handled,  but  read  daily,  and  committed  en- %0atirely to  Memory.

Thus  one  has  been  entitled  K»j£/ov,  whereby %0athey  would  give  us  to  understand  of  a  Honeycomb:  others1 %0aKygag  A^aXSs/ag,  that  is  to  say,  the  Horn  of  Plenty ;  so  that %0awhosoever  readeth  these  goodly  Titles  must  hope  for  some %0agreat  Matters ;  and  as  the  Proverb  goes,  look  to  drink  there %0aa  Draught  of  Hen's  Milk2.  You  shall  have,  moreover,  their %0aBooks  set  out  with  these  glorious  Inscriptions !

His  works  were %0anumerous,  and  among  them  was  one  on  all  the  wonders  he  had  seen  or %0a%0a%0a22  Pliny  s  Epistle  to  T.  Vespasian.          [BOOK  I. %0a%0aCcBsar  called  the  Cymbal  of  the  World  (whereas,  indeed,  he %0adeserved  to  be  rather  named  the  Drum  of  public  Fame),  was %0aso  vainglorious,  that  he  professed  to  confer  Immortality  on %0aall  those  whom  he  mentioned  in  his  Writings.  I  am  not %0aashamed  I  have  not  devised  a  prettier  Title  for  my  Book ; %0ayet  because  I  would  not  be  thought  altogether  to  condemn %0athe  Greeks,  I  am  willing  to  be  regarded  in  this  Behalf  like %0athose  excellent  Masters  in  Greece  for  Painting  and  Statuary, %0awhom  you  shall  find  in  these  Reports  of  mine,  to  have  enti- %0atled their  rare  and  perfect  Pieces  of  Work  (which  the  more %0awe  look  upon,  the  more  we  admire)  with  Half-Titles  and  im- %0aperfect Inscriptions,  in  this  Manner :  Apelles  worked  at  this %0aPicture*:  or,Polycletus  undertook  this  Image:  as  if  they  were %0abut  begun  and  never  finished,  and  laid  out  of  their  Hands : %0awhich  was  done  (no  doubt)  to  this  End,  that  for  all  the %0aDiversity  of  Men's  Judgments  scrutinising  their  Work,  yet %0athe  Artificer  thereby  had  Recourse  to  an  Apology,  as  if  he %0ameant  to  have  amended  any  Thing  therein  amiss,  in  Case  he %0ahad  not  been  prevented.  These  noble  Workmen,  therefore, %0a%0aheard  of  in  Egypt.  It  seems  to  have  been  his  practice  to  regard  every %0athing  in  proportion  to  the  wonders  it  would  enable  him  to  relate.  He  is %0athe  sole  authority  for  some  curious  facts  in  Natural  History ;  which  Pliny %0aseems  to  have  taken  from  him.  Aulus  Gellius  admits  that  he  was  prone %0agreatly  to  embellish  the  truth ;  and  Josephus  has  given  evidence  of  his %0aemptiness  and  scurrility,  which  he  poured  out  abundantly  against  the %0aJews,  to  whom  he  bore  a  mortal  antipathy.  He  had  an  opportunity  of %0adisplaying  this  in  an  address  before  the  Emperor  Caligula,  when  he  repre- %0asented their  refusal  to  worship  him  as  a  god  as  a  proof  of  their  disaffec- %0ation to  his  person  and  government ;  by  which  he  excited  the  indignation %0aof  the  emperor  against  the  illustrious  Philo  and  his  companions.  His %0anotoriety  for  reviling  and  noisy  opposition  was  such  as  to  cause  his  name %0ato  be  selected  by  a  Christian  writer  of  the  third  century,  who  assumed %0athe  name  of  Clement  of  Rome,  as  the  fictitious  opponent  of  St.  Peter,  in %0aa  disputation  concerning  the  Christian  religion :  as  mentioned  by  Eusebius %0aand  Lardner.  His  conceit  appears  from  what  Pliny  says  of  him ;  and %0ait  would  have  been  to  him  the  deepest  mortification,  could  he  have  been %0atold  that  he  would  only  be  known  to  posterity  through  the  mention  made %0aof  him  by  his  opponents.  He  is  sometimes  called  Plistonicus  and  Poly- %0ahistor.—  Wern.  Club. %0a1  Apelles  faciebat. %0a%0a%0aBOOK  I.]         Pliny  s  Epistle  to  T.

By  which  it  appeared  evidently,  that  the  said  three %0aPictures  were  so  fully  finished,  that  the  Workman  was %0ahighly  satisfied  with  their  Perfection,  and  feared  the  Censure %0aof  no  Man:  no  Marvel,  then,  if  all  three  were  so  much %0aadmired  throughout  the  World,  and  every  Man  desired  to %0abe  Master  of  them. %0a%0aFor  myself,  I  confess  that  many  more  Things  may  be %0aadded,  not  to  this  Story  alone,  but  to  all  the  Books  that  I %0ahave  published  before  :  which  I  say,  because  I  would  antici- %0apate those  Fault-finders  and  Scourgers1  of  Homer  (for  surely %0athat  is  their  very  Name) ;  because  I  hear  say  there  be  certain %0aStoic  Philosophers,  professed  Logicians,  and  Epicureans  also %0a(for  at  the  Hands  of  Critics  I  never  looked  for  any  other), %0awho  are  in  Labour  to  be  delivered  of  somewhat  against  my %0aBooks  which  I  have  published  on  Grammar :  and  the  Space %0aof  Ten  Years  has  produced  nothing  but  Abortion,  when  the %0aElephant  is  not  so  long  in  producing  her  young  one.  But %0athis  does  not  trouble  me  ;  for  I  am  not  ignorant  that  a %0aWoman  wrote  against  Theophrastus*,  though  he  was  a  Man %0aof  such  Eloquence  that  from  thence  he  obtained  his  divine %0aName,  Theophrastus :  from  whence  arose  this  Proverb,  "Then %0ago  choose  a  Tree  to  hang  thyself."3  I  cannot  refrain,  but  I %0a%0a1  Homeromastiges. %0a%0a*  Her  name  was  Leontium,  and  she  studied  philosophy  under  Epi- %0acurus, where  she  became  more  celebrated  for  her  talents  than  her  virtue. %0aThe  elegancy  of  her  style  is  praised  by  Cicero. —  Wern.

It  is  thus  translated  by  Langhorne  :— %0a"  Once,  in  an  assembly  of  the  people,  he  (Timon  of  Athens)  mounted  the %0arostrum,  and  the  novelty  of  the  thing  occasioned  an  universal  silence  and %0aexpectation  :  at  length  he  said,  '  People  of  Athens,  there  is  a  fig-tree  in %0amy  yard,  on  which  many  worthy  citizens  have  hanged  themselves ;  and %0a%0a%0a24  Pliny  s  Epistle  to  T.  Vespasian.  [BoOK  I. %0a%0amust  set  down  the  very  Words  of  Cato  the  Censor,  so  perti- %0anent to  this  purpose  ;  whereby  it  may  appear,  that  even %0aCato  himself,  who  wrote  of  Military  Discipline,  who  had %0abeen  trained  to  War  under  Scipio  Africanus,  or  rather,  in- %0adeed, under  Hannibal;  who,  in  the  end,  could  not  endure %0aAfricanus  himself,  but  was  able  to  control  him  in  martial %0aAffairs  ;  and  who,  besides  having  the  Conduct,  as  Imperator, %0aof  the  Roman  Army,  achieved  the  Superiority  over  his  Ene- %0amies in  the  Field,  and  returned  with  Victory  :  this  Cato %0acould  not  avoid  such  Slanderers ;  but  knowing  that  there %0awould  be  many  of  them  ready  to  purchase  to  themselves %0asome  Reputation  by  reproving  the  Knowledge  and  Skill  of %0aothers,  brake  out  into  a  certain  Speech  against  them  :  and %0awhat  was  it  ?  "I  know  well"  (says  he,  in  that  Book)  "that  if %0athese  Writings  be  published  to  the  World,  many  will  step %0aforth  to  cavil  at  them,  and  those  soonest  who  are  themselves %0avoid  of  all  Praise.  But  I  let  their  Words  flow  by."  It  was %0awell  said  by  Plancus,  when  being  informed  that  Asinius %0aPollio  was  framing  certain  Orations  against  him,  which %0ashould  be  published  either  by  himself  or  his  Children,  after %0athe  Decease  of  Plancus,  that  they  might  not  be  answered  by %0ahim  ;  he  remarked  :  "  That  none  but  Bugbears1  fight  with %0athe  Dead  :"  with  which  Word  he  gave  those  Orations  such  a %0aRebuff,  that  (by  the  Judgment  of  the  Learned)  none  were %0a%0a%0aas  I  have  determined  to  build  on  the  spot,  I  thought  it  necessary  to %0agive  this  public  notice,  that  such  as  choose  to  have  recourse  to  this  tree %0afor  the  aforesaid  purpose,  may  repair  to  it  before  it  is  cut  down.'" — %0aWem.

Of  these  Lemures,  those  who  were  kind  to  their  families,  and %0apreserved  them  in  peace,  were  called  Lares  familiar es,  or  domestic  Lares; %0abut  those  who,  for  punishment  of  their  crimes  committed  during  life, %0awere  condemned  to  continual  wandering,  without  finding  a  place  of  rest, %0afrightening  good  men  and  plaguing  the  wicked,  were  denominated  Larvce. %0aThe  sarcasm  consisted  in  comparing  Asinius  Pollio  to  such  a  perturbed %0aspirit.  In  the  singular  number,  Larva  signifies  a  mask,  used  to  terrify %0achildren. —  Wern.  Club. %0a%0a%0aBOOK  I.]  Pliny  s  Epistle  to  T.

Therefore,  feeling %0amyself  secure  against  these  Busy-bodies,  (and  verily  Cato %0ahath  given  such  Fellows  a  proper  Name  when  he  called %0athem  Vitilitigatores,  by  a  Term  elegantly  compounded  of %0aVices  and  Quarrels:  for  to  say  a  Truth,  what  do  they  else %0abut  pick  Quarrels  and  make  Brawls?)  I  will  proceed  in %0amy  intended  Purpose. %0a%0aTo  conclude  my  Epistle :  knowing  that  for  the  Good  of %0athe  Commonwealth  you  ought  to  be  spared  in  any  private %0aBusiness  of  your  own,  and  especially  in  perusing  these  long %0aVolumes  of  mine ;  to  prevent  such  a  Trouble,  therefore,  I %0ahave  adjoined  to  this  Epistle,  and  prefixed  before  these %0aBooks,  the  Summary  or  Contents  of  every  one :  and  care- %0afully have  I  endeavoured,  that  you  should  not  need  to  read %0athem  throughout  to  ascertain  their  Contents ;  whereby  alt %0aothers  also,  after  your  Example,  may  ease  themselves  of  the %0alike  Labour:  and  as  any  Man  is  desirous  to  know  this  or %0athat,  he  may  readily  find  in  what  Place  to  meet  with  the %0asame.

The  greater  portion  of  the  Im- %0apostors-of  those  days  were  accustomed  to  found  their  claims  to  regard  on %0atheir  acquaintance  with  some  branches  of  Philosophy,  in  which  Sergius %0aPaulus  was  an  inquiring  student.

Vespasian.          [BooK  1. %0a%3c %0a%3c I  borrow  of  my  Tent-fellow,  Catullus  (to  this  Term  of  Camps1 %0a%3c you  are  no  Stranger)  :  for  he,  as  you  know  well,  changing %0a%3c the  former  Syllables  of  his  Verses2,  one  for  another,  made %0a%3c himself  somewhat  more  harsh  than  he  would  seem  to  be %0a%3c unto  the  fine  Ears  of  his  familiar  Friends,  the  Veranioli  and %0a%3c Fabulli.  And  I  would  be  thought  by  this  my  intrusive %0a%3c Writing  to  you,  to  satisfy  one  point,  which,  as  you  com- %0a%3c plained in  your  Answer  of  late  to  another  bold  Letter  of %0a%3c mine,  I  had  not  performed,  that  is,  that  all  the  World  might %0a%3c see  (as  it  were  upon  Record)  how  the  Empire  is  managed  by %0a%3c you  and  your  Father  equally  :  and  notwithstanding  this %0a%3c Imperial  Majesty  whereunto  you  are  called,  yet  is  your %0a%3c Manner  of  conversing  with  your  old  Friends  affable,  and %0a%3c the  same  that  always  heretofore  it  had  been.  For  although %0a%3c you  have  triumphed  with  him  for  your  noble  Victories,  ful- %0a%3c filled the  Office  of  Censor,  and  also  six  times  that  of  Consul3, %0a%3c shared  the  Authority  of  Tribune,  Patrons,  and  Protectors  of %0a%3c the  Commons  of  Rome,  together  with  him  :  although,  I  say, %0a%3c you  have  otherwise  shewed  your  noble  Heart  in  honouring %0a%3c and  gracing  both  the  Court  of  the  Emperor  your  Father, %0a%3c and  also  the  whole  State  of  the  Knights  and  Gentlemen  of %0a%3c Rome,  whilst  you  were  Captain  of  the  Guard,  and  Grand %0a%3c Master  of  his  House  and  royal  Palace  (in  all  which  Places %0a%3c you  demeaned  yourself  in  respect  to  the  Good  of  the  Com- %0a%3c monwealth), yet  to  all  your  Friends,  and  especially  to  my- %0a%3c self, you  have  borne  the  same  Countenance  as  in  former %0a%3c Times,  when  we  served  under  the  same  Colours,  and  lodged %0a%3c together  in  one  Tent.  In  all  the  Greatness  to  which  you  are %0a%3c elevated,  there  is  no  other  Change  seen  in  your  Person  but %0a%3c this  :  That  your  Power  is  now  commensurate  with  your  Will, %0a%3c and  you  are  able  now  to  perform  that  Good  which  you  have %0a%3c ever  intended. %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  Conterranewn. %0a%3c %0a%3c 2  It  seemeth  that  Pliny  read  thus  in  Catullus : %0a%3c %0a%3c "  Tuputare  namque, %0a%3c Nugus  esse  aliquid  meas  solebas" %0a%3c which,  indeed,  was  but  an  hard  composition  and  couching  of  the  words. %0a%3c %0a%3c 3  Sexies,  or  rather  Septies;  out  of  Suetonim. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BOOK  I.]  Pliny  s  Epistle  to  T.

I  have  laid  Bashful  ness  aside,  but  to  no  Purpose. %0a%3c For  although  your  Gentleness  and  Humanity  induce  me  to %0a%3c draw  near  to  your  Presence,  yet  you  appear  in  other  re- %0a%3c spects in  great  Majesty :  for  the  Sublimity  of  your  Mind, %0a%3c your  high  Attainments,  set  me  as  far  behind  as  if  the  Lictors %0a%3c marched  before  you.  Was  there  ever  any  Man,  whose %0a%3c Words  passed  from  him  more  powerfully,  and  who  more %0a%3c truly  might  be  said  to  flash  forth  as  Lightning  the  Force  of %0a%3c Eloquence  ?  What  Tribune  was  ever  known  more  effectu- %0a%3c ally to  move  the  People  with  agreeable  Language  ?  How %0a%3c admirably  you  thundered  out  the  Praise  of  the  worthy  Acts %0a%3c of  your  Father !  What  a  Testimony  of  Love  to  your  Bro- %0a%3c ther! How  skilful  in  Poetry!  How  ingeniously  you  find %0a%3c means  to  imitate  your  Brother1  in  this  respect2!  But  who  is %0a%3c able  boldly  to  give  sufficient  Estimate  of  these  Gifts  ?  How %0a%3c may  any  One  enter  into  the  due  Consideration  of  them  with- %0a%3c out Fear  of  the  exact  Judgment  of  your  Wit,  especially  being %0a%3c challenged  therunto  as  you  are  ?  For  the  case  of  such  as %0a%3c publish  a  Work  in  general  is  unlike  theirs  who  dedicate  it %0a%3c by  Name  to  yourself.  For  had  I  set  forth  this  my  Book %0a%3c without  any  personal  Dedication,  I  might  have  said,  Sir, %0a%3c why  should  a  mighty  Commander  and  General3  busy  him- %0a%3c self to  read  such  Matters  ?  These  Treatises  were  written  for %0a%3c the  lower  Classes,  for  rude  Husbandmen  and  Peasants  of %0a%3c the  Country,  for  the  Mass  of  Artisans,  and  those  who  had %0a%3c Leisure  for  studying  them.  Why  should  you  make  yourself %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  For  Domitian  Vespasian  was  reputed  an  excellent  Poet. %0a%3c %0a%3c 2  The  sense  of  the  passage,  as  seen  by  supplying  the  ellipsis  of  the %0a%3c original,  is  this  :  "  With  what  testimony  of  love  you  set  forth  the  praises %0a%3c of  your  brother  to  the  full." —  Wern.

When  I  first  thought  of  this  Enter- %0a%3c prise of  mine,  I  never  reckoned  you  in  the  Number  of  those %0a%3c Judges  that  should  stoop  to  pass  sentence  upon  these  Writ- %0a%3c ings. It  is  a  common  case,  and  incident  to  Men  of  deep %0a%3c Learning,  that  their  Judgment  be  rejected  in  this  behalf. %0a%3c Even  that  illustrious  Orator,  M.  Tullius,  who  for  Wit  and %0a%3c Learning  had  not  his  Fellow,  useth  the  Benefit  of  this %0a%3c Liberty  :  and  (whereat  we  may  well  marvel)  maintaineth  the %0a%3c Action  by  an  Advocate,  taking  Example  (for  his  Defence) %0a%3c from  Lucilius :  for  in  one  Part  of  his  Works  thus  he  saith, %0a%3c /  wish  not  the  learned  Persius  to  read  these  Books  of  mine ; %0a%3c but  I  prefer  Lcelius  Decimus.  Now  if  such  a  one  as  Lucilius, %0a%3c who  was  the  first  that  durst  control  the  Writings  of  others, %0a%3c had  reason  thus  to  say ;  if  Cicero  borrowed  the  same  Speech %0a%3c in  his  Treatise  of  the  Republic1,  how  much  greater  Cause %0a%3c have  I  to  decline  the  Censure  of  a  competent  Judge?  But %0a%3c I  am  cut  off  from  this  refuge,  in  that  I  expressly  make %0a%3c choice  of  you  in  this  Dedication  of  my  Work  :  for  it  is  one %0a%3c Thing  to  have  a  Judge,  either  selected  by  Plurality  of %0a%3c Voices,  or  cast  upon  a  Man  by  drawing  Lots  ;  arid  another %0a%3c Thing  to  choose  and  nominate  him  from  all  others  :  and %0a%3c there  is  great  Difference  between  that  Provision  which  we %0a%3c make  for  a  Guest  solemnly  bidden  and  invited,  and  the %0a%3c sudden  Entertainment  which  is  ready  for  a  Stranger  who %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  This  work  of  Cicero,  entitled  "  De  Republica,"  is  more  than  once %0a%3c referred  to  by  Pliny.  The  high  standard  of  morals  which  it  upheld %0a%3c caused  it  to  be  much  respected  by  the  most  eminent  Fathers  of  the  Latin %0a%3c Church  :  insomuch  that  it  is  thought  to  have  suggested  to  St.  Augustine %0a%3c the  idea  of  his  celebrated  work,  "  De  Civitate  Dei."  During  the.  dark %0a%3c ages,  however,  the  Treatise  "  De  Republica  "  was  so  completely  lost,  that %0a%3c upon  the  revival  of  letters,  not  a  single  manuscript  of  it  could  be  any %0a%3c where  discovered.  At  length,  about  thirty  years  since,  a  large  portion  of %0a%3c it  was  found  by  Angelo  Ma'i,  then  Librarian  of  the  Vatican,  in  a  parch- %0a%3c ment manuscript.  The  parchment  had  been  washed,  and  again  used  for %0a%3c a  manuscript ;  but  the  original  writing  was  so  far  from  having  been  en- %0a%3c tirely effaced  by  the  ablution,  that  the  large  Roman  letters  were  soon %0a%3c rendered  legible  again  by  the  aid  of  a  peculiar  process.  The  recovered %0a%3c portion  of  this  valuable  work,  being  about  one-third  of  the  entire  Trea- %0a%3c tise, was  printed  in  London  in  one  volume,  8vo.  1823. —  Wern.

Cato,  that  professed %0a%3c Enemy  of  Ambition,  who  took  as  great  Contentment  in %0a%3c those  Estates  and  Dignities  which  he  refused  as  in  them %0a%3c which  he  enjoyed,  attained  to  such  a  good  Name  of  upright- %0a%3c ness, that  when  in  the  hottest  Contention  about  the  Election %0a%3c of  Magistrates,  they  that  contested  for  these  Offices  put  into %0a%3c his  Hands  their  Money  upon  Trust,  as  an  Assurance  of  their %0a%3c Integrity  and  Fidelity  in  this  respect;  they  professed  that  they %0a%3c did  it  in  Testimony  of  their  Opinion  of  his  Equity  and  Inno- %0a%3c cence :  whereupon  ensued  that  noble  and  memorable  Exclam- %0a%3c ation of  M.  Cicero  in  these  Words  :  "  Oh !  happy  M.  Portius, %0a%3c whom  no  Man  would  ever  venture  to  solicit  to  any  thing %0a%3c contrary  to  right!"  When  L.  Scipio,  surnamed  Asiaticus, %0a%3c appealed  to  the  Tribunes,  and  besought  their  lawful  Favour %0a%3c (among  whom,  C.  Gracchus  was  one,  a  Man  whom  he  took %0a%3c for  his  mortal  Enemy),  he  exclaimed,  "That  his  very  Ene- %0a%3c mies, if  they  were  his  Judges,  could  not  choose  but  give  Sen- %0a%3c tence on  his  Side."  Thus  every  Man  maketh  him  the  supreme %0a%3c Judge  of  his  Cause,  whom  himself  hath  chosen  :  which  Man- %0a%3c ner of  Choice  the  Latins  call  an  Appeal  (Provocatio).  As %0a%3c for  yourself,  who  are  set  in  the  most  eminent  Place,  and %0a%3c endued  with  the  highest  Eloquence  and  deepest  Learning,  it %0a%3c is  no  Wonder  if  those  who  do  their  Duty  unto  you  approach %0a%3c with  the  utmost  Respect  and  Reverence:  in  which  regard, %0a%3c exceeding  Care  above  all  Things  would  be  had,  that  what- %0a%3c soever is  said  or  dedicated  unto  you,  may  become  your  Per- %0a%3c son, and  be  worthy  your  Acceptance.  And  yet  the  Gods %0a%3c reject  not  the  humble  Prayers  of  country  Peasants,  yea,  and %0a%3c of  many  Nations,  who  offer  nothing  but  Milk  unto  them  : %0a%3c and  such  as  have  no  Incense,  find  grace  with  the  Oblation %0a%3c of  a  Cake  made  only  of  Meal  and  Salt ;  and  never  was  any %0a%3c Man  blamed  for  his  Devotion  to  the  Gods,  if  he  offered  ac- %0a%3c cording to  his  best  Ability. %0a%3c %0a%3c I  may  be  more  challenged  for  my  inconsiderate  Boldness, %0a%3c in  that  I  would  seem  to  present  these  Books  unto  you,  com- %0a%3c piled of  such  slender  Matter  :  for  in  them  can  be  comprised %0a%3c no  great  Ability  (which  otherwise  in  me  was  ever  meagre), %0a%3c neither  admit  they  any  Digressions,  Orations,  and  Discourses, %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 18  Pliny  s  Epistle  to  T.

[BooK  I. %0a%3c %0a%3c nor  wonderful  Incidents  and  variable  Issues ;  nor  any  other %0a%3c Circumstances  that  may  be  agreeable  to  rehearse,  or  pleasant %0a%3c to  hear.  The  Nature  of  all  Things  in  this  World,  that  is  to %0a%3c say,  Matters  concerning  our  ordinary  Life,  are  here  deli- %0a%3c neated ;  and  that  in  barren  Terms,  without  any  Show  of %0a%3c Phrases :  and  what  I  have  noted  concern  the  commonest %0a%3c Points  thereof,  so  that  I  am  to  deliver  the  Matter  either %0a%3c in  rustic,  or  foreign,  nay,  even  barbarous  Language,  such %0a%3c as  may  not  well  be  uttered,  but  with  Apology  to  the  Reader. %0a%3c Moreover,  the  Way  that  I  have  pursued  hath  not  been %0a%3c trodden  before  by  other  Writers ;  being  indeed  so  strange, %0a%3c that  no  one  would  willingly  travel  therein.  No  Latin  Author %0a%3c among  us  hath  hitherto  ventured  upon  the  same  Argument, %0a%3c no  Grecian  whatsoever  hath  handled  all :  and  that  because %0a%3c most  study  rather  to  pursue  Matters  of  Delight  and  Plea- %0a%3c sure. It  may  be  confessed,  that  others  have  made  profession %0a%3c of  doing  so,  but  they  have  done  it  with  such  Subtilty  and %0a%3c Deepness,  that  their  Efforts  lie  as  if  buried  in  Darkness.  I, %0a%3c therefore,  take  upon  me  to  gather  a  complete  Body  of  Arts %0a%3c and  Sciences  (which  the  Greeks  call  lyptuxXcwra/ds/og),  that  are %0a%3c either  altogether  unknown  or  have  been  rendered  doubtful %0a%3c through  too  great  Refinement  of  Ingenuity ;  other  Matters %0a%3c are  dealt  with  in  such  long  Discourses,  that  they  are  ren- %0a%3c dered tedious  to  the  Readers.  It  is  a  difficult  Enterprise %0a%3c to  make  old  Matters  new,  to  give  Authority  and  Credit  to %0a%3c Novelties,  to  polish  that  which  is  obsolete,  to  set  a  Lustre %0a%3c upon  that  which  is  dim,  to  grace  Things  disdained,  to %0a%3c procure  Belief  to  Matters  doubtful,  and,  in  one  Word,  to %0a%3c reduce  all  to  their  own  Nature.  And  to  make  the  Attempt %0a%3c only,  although  it  be  not  effected,  is  a  fair  and  magnificent %0a%3c Enterprise.  I  am  confidently  of  opinion,  that  the  greatest %0a%3c Credit  belongs  to  those  learned  Men  who  have  forced  their %0a%3c Way  through  all  Difficulties,  and  have  preferred  the  Profit %0a%3c of  instructing  to  the  Grace  of  pleasing,  the  Gratification  of %0a%3c mere  Desire  of  pleasing  the  present  Age;  and  this  I  have %0a%3c aimed  at,  not  in  this  Work  only,  but  in  other  of  rny  Books. %0a%3c And  I  wonder  at  T.  Livius,  a  very  celebrated  Writer,  who, %0a%3c in  a  Preface  to  one  of  his  Books  of  the  Roman  History, %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BOOK  I.]          Pliny  s  Epistle  to  T.  Vespasian.  19 %0a%3c %0a%3c which  he  compiled  from  the  Foundation  of  Rome,  thus  pro- %0a%3c tested :  That  he  had  gotten  Glory  enough  by  his  former %0a%3c Writing,  and  might  now  be  at  ease,  but  that  his  Mind  was %0a%3c so  little  able  to  abide  Repose,  that  it  could  not  subsist  but  in %0a%3c labour.  But,  surely,  in  finishing  those  Chronicles,  he  should %0a%3c have  respected  the  Glory  of  a  People  of  Conquerors,  who %0a%3c had  advanced  the  Honour  of  the  Roman  Name,  rather  than %0a%3c displayed  his  own  Praise :  his  Merit  had  been  the  greater  to %0a%3c have  continued  his  History  for  Love  of  the  Subject,  rather %0a%3c than  his  private  Pleasure;  to  have  preferred  the  Gratification %0a%3c of  Rome  to  his  own  mere  Pleasure.  As  touching  myself %0a%3c (forasmuch  as  Domitius  Piso  saith,  "  That  Books  ought  to  be %0a%3c Treasuries,  and  not  bare  Writings"),  I  will  be  bold  to  say, %0a%3c that  in  Thirty-six  Books  I  have  comprised  20,000  Things %0a%3c that  are  worthy  of  Consideration,  and  these  I  have  collected %0a%3c out  of  about  2000  Volumes  that  I  have  diligently  read  (and %0a%3c of  which  there  are  few  that  Men  otherwise  learned  have %0a%3c ventured  to  meddle  with,  for  the  deep  Matter  therein  con- %0a%3c tained), and  those  written  by  one  hundred  several  excellent %0a%3c Authors  ;  besides  a  Multitude  of  other  Matters,  which  either %0a%3c were  unknown  to  our  former  Writers,  or  Experience  has  lately %0a%3c ascertained.  And  yet  we  cannot  doubt  but  there  are  many %0a%3c Things  which  we  have  overlooked  :  for  we  are  Men,  and %0a%3c employed  in  a  Multiplicity  of  Affairs ;  and  we  follow  these %0a%3c Studies  at  vacant  Times;  that  is  to  say,  by  Night  Season %0a%3c only  ;  so  that  you  may  know,  that  to  accomplish  this  we %0a%3c have  neglected  no  Time  which  was  due  to  your  Service. %0a%3c The  Days  we  assign  to  your  Person  ;  we  sleep  only  to  satisfy %0a%3c Nature,  contenting  ourselves  with  this  Reward,  that  whilst %0a%3c we  study  (as  Varro  saith)  these  Things,  we  gain  so  many %0a%3c Hours  to  our  Life ;  for  surely  we  live  then  only  when  we %0a%3c are  awake.  Considering  those  Occasions  and  Hindrances,  I %0a%3c had  no  Reason  to  promise  much  ;  but  as  you  have  embol- %0a%3c dened me  to  dedicate  my  Books  to  you,  yourself  supply  what- %0a%3c ever in  me  is  wanting ;  not  that  I  place  Dependency  on  the %0a%3c Worth  of  the  Work ;  so  much  as  that  by  this  Means  it  will %0a%3c be  better  esteemed,  for  many  Things  there  be  that  appear %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 20  Pliny  s  Epistle  to  1\  Vespasian.

If  you  inquire  of %0a%3c me,  Where  that  History  is  ?  I  answer,  That  it  is  long  since %0a%3c finished,  and  by  this  Time  is  justified  and  approved  by  your %0a%3c Deeds :  otherwise  I  was  determined  to  leave  it  unto  my %0a%3c Heir,  and  I  gave  Order  that  it  should  be  published  only %0a%3c after  my  Death,  to  remove  the  Suspicion  that  it  had  been %0a%3c written  to  obtain  some  selfish  End.  And  by  so  doing,  I  do %0a%3c both  them  a  great  Favour,  who,  perhaps,  were  inclined  to %0a%3c publish  the  like  Chronicle ;  and  Posterity,  also,  who,  I  well %0a%3c know,  will  compete  with  us  as  we  have  done  with  our  Pre- %0a%3c decessors. A  sufficient  Argument  of  this  my  Mind  you  shall %0a%3c have  by  this,  that  in  the  Front  of  these  Books  now  in  Hand, %0a%3c I  have  set  down  the  Names  of  those  Writers  whose  Help  I %0a%3c have  used  in  the  compiling  of  them :  for  I  am  of  Opinion, %0a%3c that  it  is  the  Part  of  an  honest  Man,  and  one  that  has  a %0a%3c Claim  to  any  Modesty,  to  confess  by  whom  he  hath  pro- %0a%3c fited ;  and  not  as  many  of  those  Persons  have  done,  whom  I %0a%3c have  alleged  for  my  Authors.  For,  to  tell  you  the  Truth,  in %0a%3c conferring  them  together  about  this  Work  of  mine,  I  have %0a%3c met  with  some  of  our  modern  Writers,  who,  Word  for  Word, %0a%3c have  copied  out  whole  Books  of  old  Authors,  and  never %0a%3c vouchsafed  so  much  as  the  Naming  of  them  ;  but  have  taken %0a%3c their  Labours  to  themselves.  And  this  they  have  not  done %0a%3c in  the  Spirit  to  imitate  and  match  them,  as  Virgil  did %0a%3c Homer:  much  less  have  they  shewed  the  Simplicity  and %0a%3c Openness  of  Cicero,  who,  in  his  Books  on  the  Common- %0a%3c wealth, professeth  himself  to  follow  Plato;  in  his  consola- %0a%3c tory Epistle  written  to  his  Daughter,  he  saith,  "  I  follow %0a%3c Crantor"  and  Pancetius  likewise,  in  his  Treatise  concerning %0a%3c Offices.  Which  Volumes  of  his  (as  you  know  well)  deserve %0a%3c not  only  to  be  handled,  but  read  daily,  and  committed  en- %0a%3c tirely to  Memory.

Thus  one  has  been  entitled  K»j£/ov,  whereby %0a%3c they  would  give  us  to  understand  of  a  Honeycomb:  others1 %0a%3c Kygag  A^aXSs/ag,  that  is  to  say,  the  Horn  of  Plenty ;  so  that %0a%3c whosoever  readeth  these  goodly  Titles  must  hope  for  some %0a%3c great  Matters ;  and  as  the  Proverb  goes,  look  to  drink  there %0a%3c a  Draught  of  Hen's  Milk2.  You  shall  have,  moreover,  their %0a%3c Books  set  out  with  these  glorious  Inscriptions !  The  Muses, %0a%3c The  Pandects3,  Enchiridion4,  As/^wv5,  r/vax/%3crr/oi/6:  so  that  one %0a%3c might  even  consent  to  forfeit  a  Recognisance  or  Obligation %0a%3c in  a  Court  of  Law,  to  turn  over  the  Leaf.  But  let  a  Man %0a%3c enter  into  them,  and  behold,  what  a  Nothing  shall  he  find %0a%3c within  !  As  for  our  Countrymen,  they  are  gross  in  Compa- %0a%3c rison of  them  in  giving  Titles  to  their  Books  :  for  they  come %0a%3c with  their  Antiquities,  Examples,  and  Arts ;  and  those  also %0a%3c be  such  Authors  as  are  of  finest  Invention  amongst  them. %0a%3c Valerius,  who  (as  I  take  it)  was  named  AntiaSj  both  for  that %0a%3c he  was  a  Citizen  of  Antium,  and  also  because  his  Ancestors %0a%3c were  so  called,  was  the  first  that  gave  to  a  Book  the  Title  of %0a%3c Lucubratio,  or  Night  Study.  Varro  terms  some  of  his  Satires %0a%3c Sesculyxes  and  Flex'ibulce.

[BOOK  I. %0a%3c %0a%3c CcBsar  called  the  Cymbal  of  the  World  (whereas,  indeed,  he %0a%3c deserved  to  be  rather  named  the  Drum  of  public  Fame),  was %0a%3c so  vainglorious,  that  he  professed  to  confer  Immortality  on %0a%3c all  those  whom  he  mentioned  in  his  Writings.  I  am  not %0a%3c ashamed  I  have  not  devised  a  prettier  Title  for  my  Book ; %0a%3c yet  because  I  would  not  be  thought  altogether  to  condemn %0a%3c the  Greeks,  I  am  willing  to  be  regarded  in  this  Behalf  like %0a%3c those  excellent  Masters  in  Greece  for  Painting  and  Statuary, %0a%3c whom  you  shall  find  in  these  Reports  of  mine,  to  have  enti- %0a%3c tled their  rare  and  perfect  Pieces  of  Work  (which  the  more %0a%3c we  look  upon,  the  more  we  admire)  with  Half-Titles  and  im- %0a%3c perfect Inscriptions,  in  this  Manner :  Apelles  worked  at  this %0a%3c Picture*:  or,Polycletus  undertook  this  Image:  as  if  they  were %0a%3c but  begun  and  never  finished,  and  laid  out  of  their  Hands : %0a%3c which  was  done  (no  doubt)  to  this  End,  that  for  all  the %0a%3c Diversity  of  Men's  Judgments  scrutinising  their  Work,  yet %0a%3c the  Artificer  thereby  had  Recourse  to  an  Apology,  as  if  he %0a%3c meant  to  have  amended  any  Thing  therein  amiss,  in  Case  he %0a%3c had  not  been  prevented.  These  noble  Workmen,  therefore, %0a%3c %0a%3c heard  of  in  Egypt.  It  seems  to  have  been  his  practice  to  regard  every %0a%3c thing  in  proportion  to  the  wonders  it  would  enable  him  to  relate.  He  is %0a%3c the  sole  authority  for  some  curious  facts  in  Natural  History ;  which  Pliny %0a%3c seems  to  have  taken  from  him.  Aulus  Gellius  admits  that  he  was  prone %0a%3c greatly  to  embellish  the  truth ;  and  Josephus  has  given  evidence  of  his %0a%3c emptiness  and  scurrility,  which  he  poured  out  abundantly  against  the %0a%3c Jews,  to  whom  he  bore  a  mortal  antipathy.  He  had  an  opportunity  of %0a%3c displaying  this  in  an  address  before  the  Emperor  Caligula,  when  he  repre- %0a%3c sented their  refusal  to  worship  him  as  a  god  as  a  proof  of  their  disaffec- %0a%3c tion to  his  person  and  government ;  by  which  he  excited  the  indignation %0a%3c of  the  emperor  against  the  illustrious  Philo  and  his  companions.  His %0a%3c notoriety  for  reviling  and  noisy  opposition  was  such  as  to  cause  his  name %0a%3c to  be  selected  by  a  Christian  writer  of  the  third  century,  who  assumed %0a%3c the  name  of  Clement  of  Rome,  as  the  fictitious  opponent  of  St.  Peter,  in %0a%3c a  disputation  concerning  the  Christian  religion :  as  mentioned  by  Eusebius %0a%3c and  Lardner.  His  conceit  appears  from  what  Pliny  says  of  him ;  and %0a%3c it  would  have  been  to  him  the  deepest  mortification,  could  he  have  been %0a%3c told  that  he  would  only  be  known  to  posterity  through  the  mention  made %0a%3c of  him  by  his  opponents.

By  which  it  appeared  evidently,  that  the  said  three %0a%3c Pictures  were  so  fully  finished,  that  the  Workman  was %0a%3c highly  satisfied  with  their  Perfection,  and  feared  the  Censure %0a%3c of  no  Man:  no  Marvel,  then,  if  all  three  were  so  much %0a%3c admired  throughout  the  World,  and  every  Man  desired  to %0a%3c be  Master  of  them. %0a%3c %0a%3c For  myself,  I  confess  that  many  more  Things  may  be %0a%3c added,  not  to  this  Story  alone,  but  to  all  the  Books  that  I %0a%3c have  published  before  :  which  I  say,  because  I  would  antici- %0a%3c pate those  Fault-finders  and  Scourgers1  of  Homer  (for  surely %0a%3c that  is  their  very  Name) ;  because  I  hear  say  there  be  certain %0a%3c Stoic  Philosophers,  professed  Logicians,  and  Epicureans  also %0a%3c (for  at  the  Hands  of  Critics  I  never  looked  for  any  other), %0a%3c who  are  in  Labour  to  be  delivered  of  somewhat  against  my %0a%3c Books  which  I  have  published  on  Grammar :  and  the  Space %0a%3c of  Ten  Years  has  produced  nothing  but  Abortion,  when  the %0a%3c Elephant  is  not  so  long  in  producing  her  young  one.  But %0a%3c this  does  not  trouble  me  ;  for  I  am  not  ignorant  that  a %0a%3c Woman  wrote  against  Theophrastus*,  though  he  was  a  Man %0a%3c of  such  Eloquence  that  from  thence  he  obtained  his  divine %0a%3c Name,  Theophrastus :  from  whence  arose  this  Proverb,  "Then %0a%3c go  choose  a  Tree  to  hang  thyself."3  I  cannot  refrain,  but  I %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  Homeromastiges. %0a%3c %0a%3c *  Her  name  was  Leontium,  and  she  studied  philosophy  under  Epi- %0a%3c curus, where  she  became  more  celebrated  for  her  talents  than  her  virtue. %0a%3c The  elegancy  of  her  style  is  praised  by  Cicero. —  Wern.

It  is  thus  translated  by  Langhorne  :— %0a%3c "  Once,  in  an  assembly  of  the  people,  he  (Timon  of  Athens)  mounted  the %0a%3c rostrum,  and  the  novelty  of  the  thing  occasioned  an  universal  silence  and %0a%3c expectation  :  at  length  he  said,  '  People  of  Athens,  there  is  a  fig-tree  in %0a%3c my  yard,  on  which  many  worthy  citizens  have  hanged  themselves ;  and %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 24  Pliny  s  Epistle  to  T.

"I  know  well"  (says  he,  in  that  Book)  "that  if %0a%3c these  Writings  be  published  to  the  World,  many  will  step %0a%3c forth  to  cavil  at  them,  and  those  soonest  who  are  themselves %0a%3c void  of  all  Praise.  But  I  let  their  Words  flow  by."  It  was %0a%3c well  said  by  Plancus,  when  being  informed  that  Asinius %0a%3c Pollio  was  framing  certain  Orations  against  him,  which %0a%3c should  be  published  either  by  himself  or  his  Children,  after %0a%3c the  Decease  of  Plancus,  that  they  might  not  be  answered  by %0a%3c him  ;  he  remarked  :  "  That  none  but  Bugbears1  fight  with %0a%3c the  Dead  :"  with  which  Word  he  gave  those  Orations  such  a %0a%3c Rebuff,  that  (by  the  Judgment  of  the  Learned)  none  were %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c as  I  have  determined  to  build  on  the  spot,  I  thought  it  necessary  to %0a%3c give  this  public  notice,  that  such  as  choose  to  have  recourse  to  this  tree %0a%3c for  the  aforesaid  purpose,  may  repair  to  it  before  it  is  cut  down.'" — %0a%3c Wem.

Of  these  Lemures,  those  who  were  kind  to  their  families,  and %0a%3c preserved  them  in  peace,  were  called  Lares  familiar es,  or  domestic  Lares; %0a%3c but  those  who,  for  punishment  of  their  crimes  committed  during  life, %0a%3c were  condemned  to  continual  wandering,  without  finding  a  place  of  rest, %0a%3c frightening  good  men  and  plaguing  the  wicked,  were  denominated  Larvce. %0a%3c The  sarcasm  consisted  in  comparing  Asinius  Pollio  to  such  a  perturbed %0a%3c spirit.

There  can  be  no  doubt  that  this  writer  on  Natural %0a%3c Philosophy— whose  works  are  lost— is  the  same  person  that  is  mentioned %0a%3c in  the  13th  Chapter  of  the  Acts  of  the  Apostles;  and  from  the  nature  of %0a%3c his  pursuits  we  are  enabled  to  perceive  the  reason  why,  at  one  time,  he %0a%3c was  the  patron  of  Elymas  the  Sorcerer.  The  greater  portion  of  the  Im- %0a%3c postors-of  those  days  were  accustomed  to  found  their  claims  to  regard  on %0a%3c their  acquaintance  with  some  branches  of  Philosophy,  in  which  Sergius %0a%3c Paulus  was  an  inquiring  student.  We  do  not  find  the  name  of  the  Sorcerer %0a%3c among  the  numerous  authors  referred  to  by  Pliny.— Wern.  Club. %0a
