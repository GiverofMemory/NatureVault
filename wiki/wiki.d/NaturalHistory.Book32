(1.) — THE POWER OF NATURE AS MANIFESTED IN ANTI- %0aPATHIES. THE ECHENE1S : TWO REMEDIES. %0a%0aFollowing the proper order of things, we have now arrived %0aat the culminating point of the wonders manifested to us by %0athe operations of Nature. And even at the very outset, we %0afind spontaneously presented to us an incomparable illustration %0aof her mysterious powers : so much so, in fact, that beyond it %0awe feel ourselves bound to forbear extending our enquiries, %0athere being nothing to be found either equal or analogous to an %0aelement in which Nature quite triumphs over herself, and that, %0atoo, in such numberless ways. For what is there more unruly %0athan the sea, with its winds, its tornadoes, and its tempests ? %0aAnd yet in what department of her works has Nature been %0amore seconded by the ingenuity of man, than in this, by his %0ainventions of sails and of oars ? In addition to this, we are %0astruck with the ineffable might displayed by the Ocean's tides, %0a%0a1 It is in the last six Books of Pliny, and those only, we regret to say, %0athat we are enabled to avail ourselves of the new readings of the Bamberg %0aMS., which has been so admirably collated by M. Ian. In a vast number %0aof passages previously looked upon as hopelessly corrupt, or else not at all %0asuspected of being in a mutilated state, this MS. supplies words and clauses, %0athe existence of which in the original was hitherto unknown ; indeed by its %0aaid the indefatigable Sillig has been enabled, if we may be allowed tbe %0aterm, almost to rewrite tbe last six Books of Pliny. From a perusal of %0athese new readings, as Dr. Smith has justly remarked, we have reason to %0ainfer " that the text of the earlier Books is still in a very defective state, %0aand that much of the obscurity of Pliny may be traced to this cause." %0a%0aVOL. "VI. B %0a%0a%0a%0a2 %0a%0a%0a%0aflint's natural history. [Book XXXII. %0a%0a%0a%0aas they constantly ebb and flow, and so regulate the currents %0aof the sea as though they were the waters of one vast river. %0a%0aAnd yet all these forces, though acting in unison, and impel- %0aling in the same direction, a single fish, and that of a very %0adiminutive size — the fish known as the " echene'is" 2 — pos- %0asesses the power of counteracting. Winds may blow and %0astorms may rage, and yet the echene'is controls their fury, %0arestrains their mighty force, and bids ships stand still in their %0acareer ; a result which no cables, no anchors, from their pon- %0aderousness quite incapable of being weighed, could ever have %0aproduced ! A fish bridles the impetuous violence of the deep, %0aand subdues the frantic rage of the universe — and all this by %0ano effort of its own, no act of resistance on its part, no act at %0aall, in fact, but that of adhering to the bark ! Trifling as this %0aobject would appear, it suffices to counteract all these forces %0acombined, and to forbid the ship to pass onward in its way ! %0aFleets, armed for war, pile up towers and bulwarks on their %0adecks, in order that, upon the deep even, men may fight from %0abehind ramparts as it were. But alas for human vanity ! — %0awhen their prows, beaked as they are with brass and with %0airon, 3 and armed for the onset, can thus be arrested and %0arivetted to the spot by a little fish, no more than some half %0afoot in length ! %0a%0aAt the battle of Actium, it is said, a fish of this kind stopped %0athe praetorian ship 4 of Antonius in its course, at the moment that %0ahe was hastening from ship to ship to encourage and exhort his %0amen, and so compelled him to leave it and go on board another. %0aHence it was, that the fleet of Caesar gained the advantage 5 in %0athe onset, and charged with a redoubled impetuosity. In our %0aown time, too, one of these fish arrested the ship of the Em- %0aperor 6 Caius in its course, when he was returning from Astura %0ato Antium : 7 and thus, as the result proved, did an insignificant %0afish give presage of great events ; for no sooner had the em- %0aperor returned to Rome than he was pierced by the weapons of %0ahis own soldiers. Nor did this sudden stoppage of the ship %0a%0a2 The Echeneis remora of Linnaeus. See B. ix. c. 41. %0a%0a3 He alludes to the " rostra," or metal beaks, with which the prows of %0athe ships of war were furnished. %0a%0a4 An absurd tradition, no doubt, invented, probably, to palliate the dis- %0agrace of his defeat. %0a%0a5 From the delay caused by the stoppage of the praetorian ship. %0a%0a« Caligula. 1 For Astura and Antium, see B. iii. c. 9. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 1.] %0a%0a%0a%0aTHE ECHENE18. %0a%0a%0a%0a3 %0a%0a%0a%0along remain a mystery, the cause being perceived upon finding %0athat, out of the whole fleet, the emperor's five-banked galley %0awas the only one that was making no way. The moment this %0awas discovered, some of the sailors plunged into the sea, and, %0aon making search about the ship's sides, they found an %0aechene'is adhering to the rudder. Upon its being shown to %0athe emperor, he strongly expressed his indignation that such %0aan obstacle as this should have impeded his progress, and have %0arendered powerless the hearty endeavours of some four hun- %0adred men. One thing, too, it is well known, more particularly %0asurprised 3 him, how it was possible that the fish, while ad- %0ahering to the ship, should arrest its progress, and yet should %0ahave no such power when brought on board. %0a%0aAccording to the persons who examined it on that occasion, %0aand who have seen it since, the echene'is bears a strong resem- %0ablance to a large slug. 9 The various opinions entertained %0arespecting it we have already 10 noticed, when speaking of it %0ain the Natural History of Fishes. There is no doubt, too, that %0aall fish of this kind are possessed of a similar power ; witness, %0afor example, the well-known instance of the shells 11 which %0aare still preserved and consecrated in the Temple of Venus at %0aCnidos, and which, we are bound to believe, once gave such %0astriking evidence of the possession of similar properties. %0aSome of our own authors have given this fish the Latin name %0aof " mora." 12 It is a singular thing, but among the Greeks %0awe find writers who state that, worn as an amulet, the eche- %0ane'is has the property, 13 as already mentioned, of preventing mis- %0acarriage, and of reducing procidence of the uterus, and so per- %0amitting the foetus to reach maturity : while others, again, %0aassert that, if it is preserved in salt and worn as an amulet, it %0awill facilitate parturition ; a fact to which it is indebted for %0a%0a8 And well it might surprise him. If there was any foundation at all %0afor the story, there can be little doubt that a trick was played for the pur- %0apose of imposing upon Caligula's superstitious credulity, and that the %0arowers as well as the diving sailors were privy to it. %0a%0a9 " Liinax." A singular comparison, apparently. %0aM In B. ix. c. 41. %0a%0a11 See B. ix. c. 41, where he is speaking of a murex, a fish which bears %0ano such affinity to the remora as to warrant our author's expression, %0a" Idem valere omnia ea genera." %0a%0a12 Properly meaning "delay." "Remora" is another reading, and %0aperhaps a better one, as the word is found in Plautus. %0a%0a" In B. ix. c. 41. %0a%0aB 2 %0a%0a%0a%0a4 %0a%0a%0a%0apliny's natural history. %0a%0a%0a%0a[Book XXXII. %0a%0a%0a%0aanother name which it bears, " odinolytes." 14 Be all this as %0ait may, considering this most remarkable fact of a ship being %0athus stopped in its course, who can entertain a doubt as to the %0apossibility of any manifestation of her power by Nature, or %0aas to the effectual operation of the remedies which she has %0acentred in her spontaneous productions ? %0a%0aCHAP. 2. THE TORPEDO : NI3S T E REMEDIES. %0a%0aAnd then, besides, even if we had not this illustration by %0athe agency of the echeneis, would it not have been quite suf- %0aficient only to cite the instance of the torpedo, 15 another in- %0ahabitant also of the sea, as a manifestation of the mighty %0apowers of Nature ? From a considerable distance even, and if %0aonly touched with the end of a spear or staff, this fish has the %0aproperty of benumbing even the most vigorous arm, and of %0arivetting the feet of the runner, however swift he may be in %0athe race. If, upon considering this fresh illustration, we find %0aourselves compelled to admit that there is in existence a certain %0apower which, by the very exhalations 16 and, as it were, emana- %0ations therefrom, is enabled to affect the members of the hu- %0aman body, 17 what are we not to hope for from the remedial %0ainfluences which Nature has centred in all animated beings ? %0a%0aCHAP. 3. THE SEA HAKE : FIVE REMEDIES. %0a%0aNo less wonderful, too, are the particulars which we find %0astated relative to the sea-hare. 18 Taken with the food or %0adrink, it is a poison to some persons ; while to others, again, %0athe very sight of it is venomous. 19 Indeed, if a woman in a %0a%0au From \t5fiv rag uidivae, "to release from the pains of childbirth." %0a" See B. ix. c. 67. %0a%0a16 Ajasson remarks that it was owing probably to this opinion that it %0awas formerly the belief, that by holding the breath a person could render %0ahimself proof against the shock of the torpedo ; a precaution recommended %0aby Kaempfer, in his " Amenitates Exotica?," p, 514. Ed. 1712. %0a%0a17 " Quadam aura sui corporis adficiat membra" seems a preferable %0areading to " Quadam aura corporis sui adficiat membra," as given by the %0aBamberg MS., and adopted by Sillig. %0a%0a18 See B. ix. c. 72, and the Note. %0a%0a'9 A fabulous story, Ajasson remarks, but one that was commonly be- %0alieved in the 16th and 17th centuries. Gessner, however, a conscientious %0aenquirer into the mysteries of Nature, asserts (de Aquatilibus, p. 563) that, %0ato his own knowledge, the sight of this fish was productive of the symp- %0atoms here mentioned. Beckmann reckons the Aplysia depilana (with which %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 4.] %0a%0a%0a%0aMAEVELS OF THE BED SEA. %0a%0a%0a%0a5 %0a%0a%0a%0astate of pregnancy so much as looks upon one of these fishes, %0ashe is immediately seized with nausea and vomiting — a proof %0athat the injury has reached the stomach — and abortion is the %0aultimate result. The proper preservative against these bane- %0aful effects is the male fish, which is kept dried for the purpose %0ain salt, and worn in a bracelet upon the arm. And yet this %0asame fish, while in the sea, is not injurious, by its contact %0aeven. The only animal that eats it without fatal consequences, %0ais the mullet the sole perceptible result being that its flesh %0ais rendered more tender thereby, but deteriorated in flavour, %0aand consequently not so highly esteemed. %0a%0aPersons when poisoned 21 by the sea-hare smell strongly of %0athe fish — the first sign, indeed, by which the fact of their %0ahaving been so poisoned is detected. Death also ensues at the %0aend of as many days as the fish has lived : hence it is that, %0aas Licinius Macer informs us, this is one of those poisons %0awhich have no definite time for their operation. In India, 22 we %0aare assured, the sea-hare is never taken alive ; and, we are told %0athat, in those parts of the world, man, in his turn, acts as a %0apoison upon the fish, which dies instantly in the sea, if it is %0aonly touched with the human finger. There, like the rest %0aof the animals, it attains a much larger size than it does %0awith us. %0a%0aCHAP. 4. MAKVELS OF THE EED SEA. %0a%0aJuba, in those books descriptive of Arabia, which he has %0adedicated to Caius Caesar, the son of Augustus, informs us that %0athere are mussels 23 on those coasts, the shells of which are %0acapable of holding three semisextarii ; and that, on one occa- %0asion, a whale, 24 six hundred feet in length and three hundred %0aand sixty feet broad, 26 made its way up a river of Arabia, %0a%0athe Sea-hare of the ancients is identified) in the numher of the animal %0apoisons, and remarks that (as we find stated by Coelius Rhodiginus, B. %0axxvi. c. 30) the Emperor Titus was dispatched by the agencv of this %0apoison, administered to him by the direction of his brother f)omitian. %0aHist.

(2.) — THE INSTINCTS OF FISHES. %0a%0aThe statements which Ovid has made as to the instincts %0aoffish, in the work" of his known as the " Halieuticon," 28 %0aappear to me truly marvellous. The scarus, 29 for instance, %0awhen enclosed in the wicker kype, makes no effort to escape %0awith its head, nor does it attempt to thrust its muzzle between %0athe oziers ; but turning its tail towards them, it enlarges the %0aorifices with repeated blows therefrom, and so makes its escape %0abackwards. Should, 30 too, another scarus, from without, chance %0ato see it thus struggling within the kype, it will take the tail %0at of the other in its mouth, and so aid it in its efforts to escape. %0aThe lupus, 31 again, when surrounded with the net, furrows 32 %0athe sand with its tail, and so conceals itself, until the net has %0apassed over it. The muraena, 33 trusting in the slippery smooth- %0aness 34 of its rounded back, boldly faces the meshes of the net, %0aand by repeatedly wriggling its body, makes its escape. The %0apolyp 35 makes for the hooks, and, without swallowing the bait, %0aclasps it with its feelers ; nor does it quit its hold until it has %0aeaten off the bait, or perceives itself being drawn out of the %0awater by the rod. %0a%0aThe mullet, 36 too, is aware 37 that within the bait there is a %0ahook concealed, and is on its guard against the ambush ; still %0ahowever, so great is its voracity, that it beats the hook with %0aits tail, and strikes away from it the bait. The lupus, 38 again, %0a%0a2 6 See B. xi. c. 34. %0a%0a27 Of this work, begun by Ovid during bis banishment in Pontus, and %0aprobably never completed, only a fragment of one hundred and thirty-two %0alines has come down to us.

The niu- %0araena 39 not only swallows the hook, but /catches at the line %0awith its teeth, and so gnaws it asunder. The anthias, 40 Ovid %0asays, the moment it finds itself caught by the hook, turns its %0abody with its back downwards, upon which there is a sharp %0aknife-like fin, and so cuts the line asunder. %0a%0aAccording to Licinius Macer, the mursena is of the female %0asex only, and is impregnated by serpents, as already 42 men- %0ationed ; and hence it is that the fishermen, to entice it from its %0aretreat, and catch it, make a hissing noise in imitation of the %0ahissing of a serpent. He states, also, that by frequently beat- %0aing the water it is made to grow fat, that a blow with a stout %0astick will not kill it, but that a touch with a stalk of fennel- %0agiant 43 is instantly fatal. That in the case of this animal, the %0alife is centred in the tail, there can be no doubt, as also that %0ait dies immediately on that part of the body being struck ; %0awhile, on the other hand, there is considerable difficulty in %0akilling it with a blow upon the head.

There are numerous varieties of it, among which the hest known %0aare the Coryphaena novacula of Linnaeus, the Bason of the Mediterranean, %0ahighly esteemed as an article of food, and the Coryphaena pentedactyle of %0aBloch, identical with the Hemipteronote a cinq taches, of Lacepede. %0a%0a46 An absurdity, owing, no doubt, to its name. %0a%0a46 Or "globe-fish."

PLACES WHERE FISH EAT FROM THE HAND. %0a%0aAt many of the country-seats belonging to the Emperor the %0afish eat 51 from the hand : but the stories of this nature, told %0awith such admiration by the ancients, bear reference to lakes %0aformed by Nature, and not to fish-preserves ; that at Elorus, a %0afortified place in Sicily, for instance, not far from Syracuse. %0aIn the fountain, too, of Jupiter, at Labranda, 62 there are eels %0awhich eat from the hand, and wear ear-rings, 63 it is said. The %0asame, too, at Chios, near the Old Men's Temple 51 there; and %0aat the Fountain of Chabura in Mesopotamia, already men- %0ationed. 55 %0a%0aCHAP. 8. — PLACES WHERE FISH RECOGNIZE THE HUMAN VOICE. %0aORACULAR RESPONSES GIVEN BY FISH. %0a%0aAt Myra, too, in Lycia, the fish in the Fountain of Apollo, %0a%0a48 See B. ix. cc. 44, 45, and B. xviii. c. 87. %0a%0a49 See B. ix. cc. 1, 21 and c. 53 of the present Book.

If they seize the %0aflesh thrown to them with avidity, it is a good omen for the %0aperson who consults them ; but if, on the other hand, they %0aflap at it with their tails, it is considered an evil presage. At %0aHierapolis 56 in Syria, the fish in the Lake of Venus there obey %0athe voice of the officers of the temple : bedecked with orna- %0aments of gold, they come at their call, fawn upon them while %0athey are scratched, and open their mouths so wide as to admit %0aof the insertion of the hands. %0a%0aOff the Rock of Hercules, in the territory of Stabiae 57 in %0aCampania, the melanuri 58 seize with avidity bread that is thrown %0ato them in the sea, but they will never approach any bait in %0awhich there is a hook concealed. %0a%0aCHAP. 9. — PLACES WHERE BITTER FISH ARE FOtTND, SALT, OR %0aSWEET. %0a%0aNor is it by any means the least surprising fact, that off the %0aisland of Pele, 59 the town of Clazomenae, 60 the rock 61 [of %0aScylla] in Sicily, and in the vicinity of Leptis in Africa, 62 %0aEuboea, and Dyrrhachium, 63 the fish are bitter. In the neigh- %0abourhood of Cephallenia, Ampelos, Paros, and the rocks of %0aDelos, the fish are so salt by nature that they might easily be %0ataken to have been pickled in brine. In the harbour, again, %0aof the last-mentioned island, the fish are sweet : differences, %0aall of them, resulting, no doubt, from the diversity 64 of their %0afood. %0a%0aApion says that the largest among the fishes is the sea- %0apig, 65 known to the Lacedaemonians as the " orthagoriscos ;" %0a%0a56 The seat of the worship of the half-fish goddess Addirga, Atergatis, %0aAstarte, or Lerceto.

Ajasson remarks that though these fish have been known to %0aweigh as much as three hundred pounds, there are many others which %0agrow to a larger size, the sturgeon, and the silurus, for instance. %0a%0a%0a%0a10 %0a%0a%0a%0apliny's NATURAL HISTORY. [Book XXXII. %0a%0a%0a%0ahe states also that it grunts* like a hog when taken. These %0aaccidental varieties in the natural flavour of fish — a thing that %0ais still more surprising — may, in some cases, be owing to the %0anature of the locality; an apposite illustration of which is, the %0awell-known fact that, at Beneventum 67 in Italy, salted provi- %0asions of all kinds require 68 to be salted over again. %0a%0aCHAP. 10. WHEN 8EA-FISH WERE FIRST EATEN BY THE PEOPLE OF %0a%0aROME. THE ORBINANCE OF KING NUMA AS TO FISH. %0a%0aCassius Hemina informs us that sea- fish have been in use %0aat Rome from the time of its foundation. I will give his own %0awords, however, upon the subject : — " Numa ordained that fish %0awithout 89 scales should not be served up at the Festivals of %0athe Gods ; a piece of frugality, the intention of which was, %0athat the banquets, both public and private, as well as the %0arepasts laid before the couches™ of the gods, might be pro- %0avided at a smaller expense than formerly : it being also his %0awish to preclude the risk that the caterers for the sacred %0abanquets would spare no expense in buying provisions, and so %0aforestall the market." %0a%0aCHAP. 11. — CORAL : FORTY- THREE REMEDIES AND OBSERVATIONS. %0a%0aIn the same degree that people in our part of the world %0aset a value upon the pearls of India — a subject on which we %0ahave already spoken 71 on the appropriate occasion at sufficient %0alength — do the people of India prize coral : it being the %0aprevailing taste in each nation respectively that constitutes %0athe value of things. Coral is produced in the Red Sea also, %0a%0a66 Ajasson thinks that this notion may possibly have been derived from %0athe name, which not improbably was given to it from the spongy and %0aoleaginous nature of the flesh. %0a%0a67 See B. iii. c. 16. %0a%0a68 Owing, perhaps, to the moisture of the atmosphere. %0a%0a69 We learn from Festus, that he prohibited the use also of the scarus, %0aa fish with scales. %0a%0a70 " Ad pulvinaria." Literally, " At the cushions ;" in reference to %0athe practice of placing the statues of the gods upon pillows at the Lectis- %0aternia, which were sacrifices in the nature of feasts, at which images of %0athe gods were placed reclining on couches, with tables and food before %0athem, as if they were really partaking of the things offered in sacrifice. %0aLivy, B. v. c. 13. gives an account of a Lectisternium celebrated with great %0apomp, which he asserts to have been the first instance of the practice %0a%0a71 In B. ix. c. 54. 1 %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 11.] %0a%0a%0a%0aCOEAL. %0a%0a%0a%0a11 %0a%0a%0a%0abut of a more swarthy hue than ours. It is to be found also %0ain the Persian Gulf, where it is known by the name of "iace." %0aBut the most highly-esteemed of all, is that produced in the %0avicinity of the islands called Stcechades, 72 in the Gallic Gulf, %0aand near the JEolian Islands and the town of Drepana in the %0aSea of Sicily. Coral is to be found growing, too, at Graviscae, %0aand off the coast of Neapolis in Campania : as also at Erythrae, %0awhere it is intensely red, but soft, and consequently little %0avalued. %0a%0aIts form is that of a shrub, 73 and its colour green : its %0aberries are white and soft while under water, but the moment %0athey are removed from it, they become hard and red, resem- %0abling the berries of cultivated cornel in size and appearance. %0aThey say that, while alive, if it is only touched by a person, %0ait will immediately become as hard as stone ; and hence it is %0athat the greatest pains are taken to prevent this, by tearing it %0aup from the bottom with nets, or else cutting it short with %0aa sharp- edged instrument of iron : from which last circum- %0astance it is generally supposed to have received its name of %0a" curalium." 74 The reddest coral and the most branchy is %0aheld in the highest esteem ; but, at the same time, it must %0anot be rough or hard like stone ; nor yet, on the other hand, %0ashould it be full of holes or hollow. %0a%0aThe berries of coral are no less esteemed by the men in India %0athan are the pearls of that country by the females among us : %0atheir soothsayers, too, and diviners look upon coral as an amu- %0alet endowed with sacred properties, 75 and a sure preservative %0aagainst all dangers : hence it is that they equally value it as %0aan ornament and as an object of devotion. Before it was %0aknown in what estimation coral was held by the people of %0aIndia, the Gauls were in the habit of adorning their swords, %0a%0a72 See B. iii. c. 11. %0a%0a7S Theophrastus reckons coral among the precious stones, and the %0aPseudo-Orpheus among the minerals. Pliny would seem to be at a loss %0awhether to consider it as an animal or a vegetable. In reality it is the %0aproduction of marine organized bodies of an arborescent habit, known as %0aCorallina, with jointed stems, supported on a kind of root divided into %0abranches, which are likewise jointed. %0a%0a14 Because Ktiptirai, it is " cut short" in the 6ea, a far-fetched deriva- %0ation, apparently. %0a%0a75 Solinus informs us that Zoroaster attributed certain mysterious pro- %0aperties to coral. %0a%0a%0a%0a12 %0a%0a%0a%0apliny's natural history. %0a%0a%0a%0a[Book XXXII. %0a%0a%0a%0ashields, and helmets with it ; but at the present day, owing to %0athe value set upon it as an article of exportation, it has become %0aso extremely rare, that it is seldom to be seen even in the %0aregions that produce it. Branches of coral, hung at the neck %0aof infants, 76 are thought to act as a preservative against danger. %0aCalcined, pulverized, and taken in water, coral gives relief to %0apatients suffering from griping pains in the bowels, affections %0aof the bladder, and urinary calculi. Similarly taken in %0awine, or, if there are symptoms of fever, in water, it acts as a %0asoporific. It resists the action of fire a considerable time be- %0afore it is calcined. %0a%0aThere is also a statement made that if this medicament is %0afrequently taken internally, the spleen will be gradually con- %0asumed. Powdered coral, too, is an excellent remedy for pa- %0atients who bring up or spit blood. Calcined coral is used as %0aan ingredient in compositions for the eyes, being productive of %0acertain astringent and cooling effects : it makes flesh, also, in %0athe cavities left by ulcers, and effaces scars upon the skin. %0a%0aCHAP. 12. — THE ANTIPATHIES AND SYMPATHIES WHICH EXIST %0aBETWEEN CERTAIN OBJECTS.

THE SUR- MULLET : %0aFIFTEEN REMEDIES. %0a%0aIn reference to that repugnance which exists between cer- %0atain things, known to the Greeks as " antipathia," there is %0anothing more venomous 77 than the pastinaca, a sea-fish which %0akills trees even with its sting, as already 78 stated. And yet, %0apoisonous as it is, the galeos 79 pursues it; a fish which, %0a%0a76 A practice still retained, though the original intention of it has heen %0alost sight of. As to the form of the coral now used by infants, see %0aNote 85 to B. xxviii. c. 7. %0a%0a17 In reality, the Pastinaca or Sting-ray is not venomous ; but the %0awounds inflicted by the sting in its tail are highly dangerous, from their %0atendency to gangrene %0a%0a™ In B. ix. c. 72. As Ajasson remarks, it is quite possible that the %0asting of the Pastinaca might penetrate to the heart of a young tree, and %0aso kill it ; but that is no proof of its being poisonous.

(3).— AMPHIBIOUS ANIMALS. CASTOBETJM SIXTY-SIX %0aEEMEDIES AND OBSERVATIONS. %0a%0aThe might of Nature, too, is equally conspicuous in the %0aanimals which live upon dry land as well ; 81 the beaver, for %0ainstance, more generally known as " castor," and the testes 82 of %0awhich are called in medicine " castorea." Sextius, a most %0acareful enquirer into the nature and history of medicinal sub- %0astances, assures us that it is not the truth that this animal, %0awhen on the point of being taken, bites off its testes : he in- %0aforms us, also, that these substances are small, tightly knit, %0aand attached to the back-bone, and that it is impossible to %0aremove them without taking the animal's life. We learn from %0ahim that there is a mode of adulterating them by substituting %0athe kidneys of the beaver, which are of considerable size, %0awhereas the genuine testes are found to be extremely diminu- %0ative : in addition to which, he says that they must not be taken %0ato be bladders, as they are two in number, a provision not to be %0afound in any animal. Within these pouches, 83 he says, there %0ais a liquid found, which is preserved by being put in salt ; the %0agenuine castoreum being easily known from the false, by the %0afact of its being contained in two pouches, attached by a single %0aligament. The genuine article, he says, is sometimes fraudu- %0alently sophisticated by the admixture of gum and blood, or %0aelse hammoniacum : 84 as the pouches, in fact, ought to be of %0a%0a80 See B. xix. c. 15, and B. xxii. c. 49. %0a%0a81 As water, and are consequently amphibious. %0a%0a82 The Castoreum of the ancients, the " castor" of our Materia Medica, %0ais not in reality produced from the testes of the beaver, as was supposed %0aby the ancients, but from two oral pouches situate near the anus of the %0aanimal of either sex. There are four of these pouches in all, two con- %0ataining a species of fat, and two larger ones including in their membranous %0acells a viscous fetid substance, which forms the castor of medicine. It is %0aconsidered to be an antispasmodic. %0a%0a8:5 " Folliculos."

It acts also as an emmenagogue and as %0aan expellent of the afterbirth, being taken by the patient, in %0adoses of two drachmae, with pennyroyal, 87 in water. It is em- %0aployed also for the cure of vertigo, opisthotony, fits of trem- %0abling, spasms, affections of the sinews, sciatica, stomachic %0acomplaints, and paralysis, the patient either being rubbed with %0ait all over, or else taking it as an electuary, bruised and incor- %0aporated with seed of vitex, 88 vinegar, and oil of roses, to the %0aconsistency of honey. In the last form, too, it is taken for the %0acure of epilepsy, and in a potion, for the purpose of dispelling %0aflatulency and gripings in the bowels, and for counteracting the %0aeffects of poison. %0a%0aWhen taken as a potion, the only difference is in the mode %0aof mixing it, according to the poison that it is intended to %0aneutralize ; thus, for example, when it is taken for the sting %0aof the scorpion, wine is used as the medium ; and when for %0ainjuries inflicted by spiders or by the phalangium, 89 honied %0awine where it is intended to be brought up again, and rue %0awhere it is desirable that it should remain upon the stomach. %0aFor injuries inflicted by the chalcis, 90 it is taken with myrtle %0awine ; for the sting of the cerastes 91 or prester 92 with panax 93 or %0a%0a83 See B. xxv. c. 70. %0a%0a66 Castor is still given to females to inhale, when suffering from hysteria %0a%0a87 See B. xx. c. 54. 8b s fce B. xxiv. c. 38. %0a%0a89 See B. viii. c. 41, B. x. c. 95, and B. xi. cc 24 28 %0a%0a» See B. xxix. c 32 h See B. viii. c. 35,' and B. xvi, c. 80. %0a%0aI," f ee sx - c> L 1 ; B> XXU - C " 13 ; B - xxlii - c - 23 > & xxiv. c. 73. %0a93 See B. xii. c. 57. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 14.J %0a%0a%0a%0aTHE TORTOISE. %0a%0a%0a%0a15 %0a%0a%0a%0arue in -wine ; and for those of other serpents, with wine only. %0aIn all these cases two drachmas of castoreum is the proper %0adose, to one of the other ingredients respectively.

For %0athe cure of ear-ache, the best plan is to mix it with meco- %0anium. 96 Applied with Attic honey in the form of an ointment, %0ait improves the eyesight, and taken with vinegar it arrests %0ahiccup. %0a%0aThe urine, too, of the beaver, is a neutralizer of poisons, %0aand for this reason is used as an ingredient in antidotes. The %0abest way of keeping it, some think, is in the bladder of the %0aanimal. %0a%0aCHAP. 14 (4.) — THE TORTOISE : SIXTV-SIX REMEDIES ANI> OBSER- %0aVATIONS. %0a%0aThe tortoise, 97 too, is an animal that is equally amphibious %0awith the beaver, and possessed of medicinal properties as %0astrongly developed ; in addition to which, it claims an equal %0adegree of notice for the high price which luxury sets upon its %0ashell, 98 and the singularity of its conformation. Of tortoises, %0athere are various kinds, land tortoises, 99 sea tortoises, 1 tortoises 2 %0awhich live in muddy waters, and tortoises 2 which live in fresh ; %0athese last being known to some Greek authors by the name of %0a" emydes." The flesh of the land- tortoise is employed for %0afumigations more particularly, and we find it asserted that it %0ais highly salutary for repelling the malpractices of magic, and for %0a%0a91 Or Mistletoe ; see B. xvi. c. 92. %0a%0a95 As to tbe identity of the "nitrum" of the ancients, see B. xxxi. %0ac. 46 and the Notes. %0a%0a96 See B. xx. c. 76. %0a%0a97 Under the head of " testudines," he includes the tortoises, terra- %0apenes, and turtles, which form an order of reptiles, known in Natural %0aHistory as Chelonia, and characterised by the body being enclosed be- %0atween a double shield or shell, out of which protrude the head, tail, and %0afour extremities. %0a%0a98 See B. ix. cc. 11, 12. 99 Our tortoises so called. %0a%0a1 Our Chelonides, or turtles. %0a%0a2 The Emydes and Trionyches of Modern Natural History. %0a%0a%0a%0a16 %0a%0a%0a%0aflint's NATURAL HISTOEY. [Book XXXII. %0a%0a%0a%0aneutralizing poisons. These tortoises are found in the greatest %0anumbers in Africa ; where the head and feet being first cut off, %0ait is said, they are given to persons by way of antidote. %0aEaten, too, in a broth made from them, they are thought to %0adisperse scrofula, diminish the volume of the spleen, and effect %0athe cure of epilepsy. The blood of the land-tortoise improves %0athe eyesight, and removes cataract : it is kept also, made up %0awith meal into pills, which are given with wine when neces- %0asary, to neutralize the poison of all kinds of serpents, frogs, %0aspiders, and similar venomous Animals. It is found a useful %0aplan, too, in cases of glaucoma, to anoint the eyes with gall of %0atortoises, mixed with Attic honey, and, for the cure of injuries %0ainflicted by scorpions, to drop the gall into the wound. %0a%0aAshes of tortoiseshell, kneaded up with wine and oil, are %0aused for the cure of chaps upon the feet, and of ulcerations. %0aThe shavings of the surface of the shell, administered in drink, %0aact as an antaphrodisiac : a thing that is the more surprising, %0afrom the fact that a powder prepared from the whole of the shell %0ahas the reputation of being a strong aphrodisiac. As to the urine %0aof the land-tortoise, I do not think that it can be obtained %0aotherwise than by opening it and taking out the bladder ; this %0abeing one of those substances to which the adepts in magic %0aattribute such marvellous properties. For the sting of the %0aasp, they say, it is wonderfully effectual ; and even more 60, %0aif bugs are mixed with it. The eggs of the tortoise, hardened %0aby keeping, are applied to scrofulous sores and ulcers arising %0afrom burns or cold : they are taken also for pains in the %0astomach. %0a%0aThe flesh of the sea-tortoise, 3 mixed with that of frogs, is %0aan excellent remedy for injuries caused by the salamander; 4 %0aindeed there is nothing that is a better neutralizer of the secre- %0ations of the salamander than the sea-tortoise. The blood of %0athis animal reproduces the hair when lost through alopecy, %0aand is curative of porrigo and all kinds of ulcerations of the %0ahead ; the proper method of using it being to let it dry, and %0athen gently wash it off. For the cure of ear-ache, this blood %0ais injected with woman's milk, and for epilepsy it is eaten %0awith fine wheaten flour, three heminae of the blood being %0amixed with one hemina of vinegar. It is prescribed also for %0athe cure of asthma ; but in this cas%3ce in combination with one %0a3 Or turtle. * See B. x. c. 86. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 14.] %0a%0a%0a%0aTHE TORTOISE. %0a%0a%0a%0a17 %0a%0a%0a%0ahemina of wine. Sometimes, too, it is taken by asthmatic %0apatients, with barley-meal and vinegar, in pieces about the %0asize of a bean ; one of these pieces being taken each morn- %0aing and evening at first, but after some days, two in the %0aevening. In cases of epilepsy, the mouth of the patient %0ais opened and this blood introduced. For spasmodic affections, %0awhen not of a violent nature, it is injected, in combination with %0acastoreum, as a clyster. If a person rinses his teeth three %0atimes a year with blood of tortoises, he will be always ex- %0aempt from tooth-ache. This blood is also a cure for asthmatic %0aaffections, and for the malady called " orthopnoea," being admi- %0anistered for these purposes in polenta. %0a%0aThe gall of the tortoise improves the eye-sight, effaces scars, %0aand cures affections of the tonsillary glands, quinsy, and all %0akinds of diseases of the mouth, cancers of that part more par- %0aticularly, as well as cancer of the testes. Applied to the nos- %0atrils it dispels epilepsy, and sets the patient on his feet : %0aincorporated in vinegar with the slough of a snake, it is a %0asovereign remedy for purulent discharges from the ears. Some %0apersons add ox-gall and the broth of boiled tortoise-flesh, with %0aan equal proportion of snake's slough ; but in such case, care %0amust be taken to boil the tortoise in wine. Applied with %0ahoney, this gall is curative of all diseases of the eyes ; and %0afor the cure of cataract, gall of the sea-tortoise is used, in %0acombination with blood of the river- tortoise and milk. The %0ahair, too, of females, is dyed 5 with this gall. For the cure of %0ainjuries inflicted by the salamander, it will be quite sufficient %0ato drink the broth of boiled tortoise-flesh. %0a%0aThere is, again, a third 6 kind of tortoise, which inhabits mud %0aand swampy localities : the shell on its back is flat and broad, %0alike that upon the breast, and the callipash is not arched and %0arounded, the creature being altogether of a repulsive appear- %0aance. However, there are some remedial medicaments to be %0aderived even from this animal. Thus, for instance, three of %0athem are thrown into a fire made with wood cuttings, and the %0amoment their shells begin to separate they are taken off: the %0aflesh is then removed, and boiled with a little salt, in one con- %0agius of water. When the water has boiled down to one third, %0a%0a5 To make it of a vellow or golden colour, Dalechamps says. %0afi Identified by Ajasson with the Emys lutaria of Modern Natural %0aHistory. %0a%0aVOL.

The gall, too, is found %0avery useful for carrying off pituitous humours and corrupt %0ablood : taken in cold water, it has an astringent effect upon %0athe bowels. %0a%0aThere is a fourth kind of tortoise, which frequents rivers. %0aWhen used for its remedial properties, the shell of the animal %0ais removed, and the fat separated from the flesh and beaten up %0awith the plant aizoiim, 7 in combination with unguent and lily %0aseed : a preparation highly effectual, it is said, for the cure of %0aquartan fevers, the patient being rubbed with it all over, the %0ahead excepted, just before the paroxysms come on, and then %0awell wrapped up and made to drink hot water. It is stated %0aalso, that to obtain as much fat as possible, the tortoise should %0abe taken on the fifteenth day of the moon, the patient being %0aanointed on the sixteenth. The blood of this tortoise, dropt, %0aby way of embrocation, upon the region of the brain, allays %0ahead-ache ; it is curative also of scrofulous sores. Some per- %0asons recommend that the tortoise should be laid 8 upon its back %0aand its head cut off with a copper knife, the blood being re- %0aceived in a new earthen vessel ; and they assure us that the %0ablood of any kind of tortoise, when thus obtained, will be an %0aexcellent liniment for the cure of erysipelas, running ulcers %0aupon the head, and warts. Upon the same authority, too, we %0aare assured that the dung of any kind of tortoise is good for %0athe removal of inflammatory tumours. Incredible also as %0athe statement is, we find it asserted by some, that ships 9 make %0away more slowly when they have the right foot of a tortoise %0aon board. %0a%0aCHAP. 15. — REMEDIES DERIVED FROM THE AQUATIC ANIMALS, %0aCLASSIFIED ACCORDING TO THE RESPECTIVE DISEASES. %0a%0aWe will now proceed to classify the various remedies de- %0arived from the aquatic animals, according to the several dis- %0aeases ; not that we are by any means unaware that an expo- %0asition of all the properties of each animal at once, would be %0amore to the reader's taste, and more likely to excite his admi- %0a%0a7 Our Houseleek.

THE SEA.-STA.R : SEVEN REME- %0aDIES. %0a%0aWe have already 10 stated in what country the honey is %0avenomous : the fish known as the dorade' 1 is an antidote to its %0aeffects. Honey, even in a pure state, is sometimes productive of %0asurfeit, and of fits of indigestion, remarkable for their severity ; %0athe best remedy in such case, according to Pelops, is to cut off %0athe feet, head, and tail, of a tortoise, and boil and eat the %0abody ; in place, however, of the tortoise, Apelles mentions %0athe scincus, an animal which has been described elsewhere. 12 %0a"We have already mentioned too, on several occasions, 13 how %0ahighly venomous is the menstruous fluid : the surmullet, as %0aalready 14 stated, entirely neutralizes its effects. This last fish, %0atoo, either applied topically or taken as food, acts as an anti- %0adote to the venom 15 of the pastinaca, the land and sea scor- %0apion, the dragon, 16 and the phalangium. 17 The head of this %0afish, taken fresh and reduced to ashes, is an active neutralizer %0aof all poisons, that of fungi more particularly. %0a%0aIt is asserted also, that if the fish called the sea-star 19 is %0asmeared with a fox's blood, and then nailed to the upper lintel %0aof the door, or to the door itself, with a copper nail, no noxious %0aepells will be able to obtain admittance, or, at all events, to be %0aproductive of any ill effects. %0a%0a10 In B. xxi. c. 44. %0a%0a11 Or Gilt-hcad.

ELEVEN REMEDIES DERIVED FKOM CYBITJM. %0a%0aStings inflicted by the sea-dragon 19 or by the sea-scorpion, %0aare cured by an application 20 of the flesh of those animals to %0athe wound ; the bites, too, of spiders are healed by the same %0ameans. In fine, as an antidote to every kind of poison, whether %0ataken internally or acting through the agency of a sting or %0abite, there is considered to be nothing in existence more effec- %0atual than a decoction of the sea-dragon and sea-scorpion. %0a%0aThere are also certain remedies of this nature derived from %0apreserved fish. Persons, for instance, who have received in- %0ajuries from serpents, or have been bitten by other venomous %0aanimals, are recommended to eat salt fish, and to drink undi- %0aluted wine every now and then, so as, through its agency, to %0abring up the whole of the food again by vomit : this method %0abeing particularly good in cases where injuries have been %0areceived from the lizard called " chalcis," 21 the cerastes, 22 %0athe reptile known as the " seps," 23 the elops, 24 or the dipsas. 24 %0aFor the sting of the scorpion, salted fish should be taken in %0alarger quantities, but not brought up again, the patient sub- %0amitting to any amount of thirst it may create : salt fish, too, %0ashould be applied, by way of plaster, to the wound. For the %0abite of the crocodile there is no more efficient remedy known. %0aFor the sting of the serpent called " prester," the sarda 26 is %0aparticularly good. Salt fish is employed also as a topical appli- %0acation for the bite of the mad dog ; and even in cases where %0a%0a19 See Note 16 above. %0a%0a20 Rondelet asserts, B. vi. c. 19, that he himself had cured the sting of %0athe sea-dragon by an application of the liver of that fish. %0a%0a21 See B. xxix. c. 32. %0a%0a22 See B. viii. c. 35, B. xi. c. 43, and B, xvi. c. 80. %0a%0a23 See B. xxiii. c. 29. %0a%0a24 Nicander, in his Theriaca, classes the Elops among the innocuous %0aserpents.

For injuries, also, %0ainflicted by the sea-dragon, 27 an application is made of salt %0afish steeped in vinegar. Cybium, 28 too, is productive of similar %0aeffects. As a cure for the venomous sting inflicted with its %0astickle by the sea-dragon, the fish itself is applied topically %0ato the wound, or else its brain, extracted whole. %0a%0achap. 18. — the sea-frog: six bemedies. the river-frog : %0afifty-two eemedies. the bramble-frog : one remedy, %0athiety-two obseevations on these animals. %0a%0aThe broth prepared from sea-frogs, 29 boiled in wine and vine- %0agar, is taken internally as a neutralizer of poisons and of the %0avenom of the bramble-frog, 30 as also for injuries inflicted by %0athe salamander. 31 For the cure of injuries caused by the sea- %0ahare and the various serpents above mentioned, it is a good %0aplan to eat the flesh of river-frogs, or to drink the liquor in %0awhich they have been boiled : as a neutralizer, too, of the %0avenom of the scorpion, river-frogs are taken in wine. Demo- %0acritus assures us that if the tongue is extracted from a live %0afrog, with no other part of the body adhering to it, and is %0athen applied — the frog being first replaced in the water — to a %0awoman while asleep, just at the spot where the heart is felt to %0apalpitate, she will be sure to give a truthful answer to any %0aquestion that may be put to her. %0a%0aTo this the Magi 32 add some other particulars, which, if there %0ais any truth in them, would lead us to believe that frogs ought %0ato be considered much more useful to society than laws. 33 %0aThey say, for instance, that if a man takes a frog and trans- %0afixes it with a reed, entering the body at the sexual parts and %0acoming out at the mouth, and then dips the reed in the men- %0astrual discharge of his wife, she will be sure to conceive an %0aaversion for all paramours.

[Book XXXII. %0a%0a%0a%0ato the kype or hook, as the case may be, makes a most excel- %0alent bait, for purples more particularly, is a well-known fact. %0aFrogs, they say, have a double 34 liver ; and of tins liver, when %0aexposed to the attacks of ants, the part that is most eaten %0aaway is thought to be an effectual antidote to every kind of %0apoison. %0a%0aThere are some frogs, again, which live only among brakes %0aand thickets, for which reason they have received the name of %0a"rubetJE," 36 or "bramble-frogs," as already 36 stated. The %0aGreeks call them " phryni :" they are the largest in size of %0aall the frogs, have two protuberances 37 like horns, and are %0afull 38 of poison. Authors quite vie with one another in relat- %0aing marvellous stories about them ; such, for instance, as that %0aif they are brought into the midst of a concourse of people, %0asilence will instantly prevail ; as also that by throwing into boil- %0aing water a small bone that is found in their right side, the %0avessel will immediately cool, and the water refuse to boil again %0auntil it has been removed. This bone, they say, may be %0afound by exposing a dead bramble-frog to ants, and letting %0athem eat away the flesh : after which the bones must be put %0ainto the vessel, 39 one by one. %0a%0aOn the other hand, again, in the left side of this reptile %0athere is another bone, they say, which, thrown into water, has %0aall the appearance of making it boil, and the name given to %0awhich is " apocynon." 40 This bone, it is said, has the pro- %0aperty of assuaging the fury of dogs, and, if put into the drink, %0aof conciliating love and ending discord and strife. "Worn, %0atoo, as an amulet, it acts as an aphrodisiac, we are told.

Wine, %0atoo, should also be used in all such cases.

For all these purposes, however, sea-crabs, it should %0abe remembered, are not so useful. Thrasyllus informs us that %0athere is nothing so antagonistic to serpents as crabs; that %0aswine, when stung by a serpent, cure themselves by eatiDg %0athem ; and that, while the sun is in the sign of Cancer, 47 ser- %0apents suffer the greatest tortures. %0a%0aThe flesh, too, of river-snails, eaten either raw or boiled, is %0aan excellent antidote to the venom of the scorpion, some per- %0asons keeping them salted for the purpose. These snails are ap- %0aplied, also, topically to the wound. %0a%0aThe coracinus 48 is a fish peculiar to the river Nilus, it is %0atrue, but the particulars we are here relating are for the benefit %0aof all parts of the world : the flesh of it is most excellent as %0aan application for the cure of wounds inflicted by scorpions. %0aIn the number of the poisonous fishes we ought to reckon the %0asea-pig, 49 a fish which causes great suffering to those who have %0abeen pierced with the pointed fin upon its back : the proper %0aremedy in such case is the slime taken from the other parts %0aof the body of the fish. %0a%0aCHAP. 20. — THE SEA-CAIE : TEN EEMEDIES.

Oysters love fresh water and spots 56 where %0anumerous rivers discharge themselves into the sea ; hence it %0ais that the pelagia 67 are of such small size and so few in num- %0aber. Still, however, we do find them breeding among rocks %0aand in places far remote from the contact of fresh water, as in %0athe neighbourhood of Grynium 58 and of Myrina, 59 for example. %0aGenerally speaking, they increase in size with the increase of %0athe moon, as already stated by us when 60 treating of the aqua- %0atic animals : but it is at the beginning of summer, more par- %0a%0a51 There is considerable truth in this observation. %0a%0a52 The sea-horse, the Syngnathus hippocampus of Linnaeus.

But in every country, those oysters are the most %0ahighly esteemed that are compact without being slimy from %0atheir secretions, and are remarkable more for their thickness %0athan their breadth. They should never be taken in either %0amuddy or sandy spots, but from a firm, hard bottom ; the %0ameat 63 should be compressed, and not of a fleshy consistence; %0aand the oyster should be free from fringed edges, and lying %0awholly in the cavity of the shell. Persons of experience in %0athese matters add another characteristic ; a fine purple thread, %0athey say, should run round the margins of the beard, this being %0alooked upon as a sign of superior quality, and obtaining for %0athem their name of " calliblephara." 84 %0a%0aOysters are all the better for travelling and being removed %0ato new waters; thus, for example, the oysters of lirundisium, %0ait is thought, when fed in the waters of Avernus, both retain %0atheir own native juices and acquire the flavour of those of %0a%0a61 See B. ix. c. 74.

It must be short, and consequently plump and compara- %0atively destitute of beard, and it must not be fleshy, as that would imply a %0adegree of toughness not desirable in an oyster. The words "nec fibris %0alaciniata ac tota in alvo," only seem to be an amplification of the pre- %0aceding ones, " spondylo brevi et non carnoso." %0a%0af * Literally, " Having beautiful eyebrows." %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 21 ] THE YABIOUS OP OTSTEES. %0a%0a%0a%0a27 %0a%0a%0a%0aLake Lucrinus. 65 Thus much with reference to the meat of %0athe oyster ; we will now turn to the various countries which %0aproduce it, so that no coast may be deprived of the honours %0awhich properly belong to it. But in giving this description %0awe will speak in the language of another, using the words of %0aa writer who has evinced more careful discernment in treating %0aof this subject than any of the other authors of our day. %0aThese then are the words of Mucianus, in reference to the %0aoyster : — " The oysters of Cyzicus 66 are larger than those of %0aLake Lucrinus, 66 * fresher 67 than those of the British coasts, 6S %0asweeter 69 than those of Medulae, 70 more tasty 71 than those of %0aEphesus, more plump than those of Lucus, 12 less slimy than %0athose of Coryphas, 73 more delicate than those of Istria, 74 and %0awhiter than those of Circeii." 75 For all this, however, it is a %0afact well ascertained that there are no oysters fresher or more %0adelicate than those of Circeii, last mentioned. %0a%0aAccording to the historians of the expedition of Alexander, %0athere were oysters found in the Indian Sea a foot 76 in diameter : %0aamong ourselves, too, the nomenclature of some spendthrift %0aand gourmand has found for certain oysters the name of " tri- %0adacna," 77 wishing it to be understood thereby, that they are so %0alarge as to require three bites in eating them. "We will %0atake the present opportunity of stating all the medicinal pro- %0aperties that are attributed to oysters. They are singularly %0arefreshing 78 to the stomach, and tend to restore the appetite. %0aLuxury, too, has imparted to them an additional coolness %0aby burying them in snow, thus making a medley of the %0a%0a66 See B. ix. c. 79. 65 See B. v. c. 40. %0a%0a66 * See B. iii. c. 9. 67 u Dulciora." %0a%0a68 Those of Rutupae, the present Ricbborough in Kent, were highly %0aesteemed by the Romans.

They act detergently also upon %0aulcerations of the bladder. 79 Boiled in their shells, unopened %0ajust as they come to hand, oysters are marvellously efficacious %0afor rheumatic defluxions. Calcined oyster-shells, mixed with %0ahoney, allay affections of the uvula and of the tonsillary glands : %0athey are similarly used for imposthumes of the parotid glands, %0ainflamed tumours, and indurations of the mamillae. Applied %0awith water, these ashes are good for ulcerations of the head, %0aand impart a plumpness to the skin in females. They are %0asprinkled, too, upon burns, and are highly esteemed as a den- %0atifrice. Applied with vinegar, they are good for the removal %0aof prurigo and of pituitous eruptions. Beaten up in a raw %0astate, they are curative of scrofula and of chilblains upon the %0afeet. %0a%0aPurples, too, are useful 80 as a counterpoison. %0a%0aCHAP. 22. — SEA- WEED : TWO REMEDIES. %0a%0aAccording to Nicander, sea- weed is also a theriac. 81 There %0aare numerous varieties of it, as already 82 stated ; one, for in- %0astance, with an elongated leaf, another red, another again with a %0abroader leaf, and another crisped. The most esteemed kind of %0aall is that which grows off the shores of Crete, upon the rocks %0athere, close to the ground : it being used also for dyeing wool, %0aas it has the property 83 of so fixing the colours as never to %0aallow of their being washed out. Nicander recommends it to %0abe taken with wine. %0a%0a* 9 Ajasson remarks that calcined oyster-shells formed an ingredient in %0athe famous lithontriptic of Mrs. Stephens, a so-called remedy which ob- %0atained for her a considerable reward, voted by the English Parliament in %0athe middle of last century. %0a%0a80 A statement purely imaginary, Ajasson thinks ; the liquid of this %0aclass of shell-fish containing no element whatever to fit it for an antidote %0a%0asi Or antidote. 82 In B. xxvi. c. 66. %0a%0a83 Many varieties of sea-weed are now known, Ajasson says, to possess %0athis property, and are still used by savage nations for colouring the body. %0aIn Europe, the use of indigo, madder, and other tinctorial plants of a %0amore decided character, has caused them to be entirely neglected for dye- %0aing purposes. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 23.] REMEDIES FOE DISEASES OE THE ETES. %0a%0a%0a%0a29 %0a%0a%0a%0aCHAP. 23.

Others, again, %0arecommend one sextarius of leeches to be left to putrefy the %0a6ame number of days in a leaden vessel, with two sextarii of %0avinegar, the hair to be well rubbed with the mixture in the %0asun. According to Sornatius, this preparation is naturally %0aso penetrating, that if females, when they apply it, do not %0atake the precaution of keeping some oil in the mouth, the %0ateeth even will become blackened thereby. Ashes of burnt %0ashells of the murex or purple are used as a liniment, with honey, %0afor ulcerations of the head ; the shells, too, of other shell-fish, 89 %0apowdered merely, and not calcined, are very useful for the same %0apurpose, applied with water. For the cure of head-ache, %0acastoreum is employed, in combination with peucedanum 90 and %0aoil of roses. %0a%0aCHAP. 24. — REMEDIES FOR DISEASES OF THE ETES AND EYE- %0aLIDS.

The gall of the %0acallionymus 93 heals murks upon the eyes and cauterizes fleshy %0aexcrescences about those organs : indeed, there is no fish with %0aa larger quantity of gall than this, an opinion expressed too %0aby Menander in his Comedies. 91 This fish is known also as %0athe " uranoscopos," 95 from the eyes being situate in the upper %0apart of the head. 96 The gall, too, of the coracinus 91 has the %0aeffect of sharpening the eyesight. %0a%0aThe gall of the red sea-scorpion, 98 used with stale oil or Attic %0ahoney, disperses incipient cataract ; for which purpose, the %0aapplication should be made three times, on alternate days. A %0asimilar method is also employed for removing indurations 99 of %0athe membrane of the eyes. The surmullet, used as a diet, %0aweakens the eyesight, it is said. The sea-hare is poisonous %0aitself, but the ashes of it are useful as an application for pre- %0aventing superfluous hairs on the eyelids from growing again, %0awhen they have been once pulled out by the roots. For this %0apurpose, however, the smaller the fish is, the better. Small %0ascallops, too, are salted and beaten up with cedar resin for a %0asimilar purpose, or else the frogs known as " diopetes "* and %0a%0a91 This assertion reminds us of the healing effects of the fish with %0a•which Tobit cured his father's blindness.

When this remedy %0ais used, it is the practice to turn up the eyelids, and to leave %0athe medicament there a few moments only ; after which, the %0apart is anointed with oil of roses, and the inflammation mo- %0adified by the application of a bread-poultice. Powdered bone %0aof saepia is used also for the treatment of nyctalopy, being %0aapplied to the eyes with vinegar. Reduced to ashes, this %0asubstance removes scales upon the eyes : applied with honey, %0ait effaces marks upon those organs : and used with salt and %0acadmia, 3 one drachma of each, it disperses webs which im- %0apede the eyesight, as also albugo in the eyes of cattle. They %0asay, too, that if the eyelids are rubbed with the small bone 4 %0ataken from this fish, a perfect cure will be experienced. %0a%0aSea-urchins, applied with vinegar, cause epinyctis to dis- %0aappear. According to what the magicians say, they should be %0aburnt with vipers' skins and frogs, and the ashes sprinkled in %0athe drink ; a great improvement of the eyesight being gua- %0aranteed as the sure result. %0a%0a"Ichthyocolla" 6 is the name given to a fish with a glutinous %0aBkin ; the glue made from which is also known by the same %0aname, and is highly useful for the removal of epinyctis. %0aSome persons, however, assert that it is from the belly of the %0afish, and not the skin — as in the case of bull glue — that the %0aichthyocolla is prepared. That of Pontus 6 is highly esteemed : %0ait is white, free from veins or scales, and dissolves with the %0agreatest rapidity. The proper way of using it, is to cut it %0ainto small pieces, and then to leave it to soak in water or %0avinegar a night and a day, after which it should be pounded %0a%0a2 Cortex. 3 See B. xxxiv. cc. 22, 23. 4 " Ossiculo." %0a%0a5 Literally, " fish-glue."

Hardouin takes the fish here spoken of to be %0aidentical with that mentioned in B. ix. c. 17, as being caught in the %0aBorysthene, and destitute of bones. It is most probable, however, that %0athe "ichthyocolla" of the ancients, or "fish-glue," was the same as our %0aisinglass, and that it was prepared from the entrails of various fish, the %0a■tnrgeon more particularly, the Acipenser huso of Linnaeus. %0a%0a6 The best isinglass still comes from Russia. %0a%0a%0a%0a32 %0a%0a%0a%0aPLINY'S JfATUBAL 1IIST0BT. %0a%0a%0a%0a[Book XXXII. %0a%0a%0a%0awith sea-shore pebbles, to make it melt the more easily.

If the eyes, too, %0aof a frog are taken out at the time of the moon's conjunction, %0aand similarly worn by the patient, enclosed in an eggshell, %0athey will effectually remove indurations of the membrane of %0athe eyes. The rest of the flesh applied topically, removes %0aall marks resulting from blows. The eyes, too, of a crab, %0aworn attached to the neck, by way of amulet, are a cure for %0aophthalmia, it is said. There is a small frog 8 which lives in %0areed-beds and among grass more particularly, never croaks, %0abeing quite destitute of voice, is of a green colour, and is apt %0ato cause tympanitis in cattle, if they should happen to swallow %0ait. The slimy moisture on this reptile's body, scraped off with %0aa spatula and applied to the eyes, greatly improves the sight, %0athey say : the flesh, too, is employed as a topical application %0afor the removal of pains in the eyes. %0a%0aSome persons take fifteen frogs, and after spitting them %0aupon as many bulrushes, put them into a new earthen vessel : %0athey then mix the juices which flow from them, with gum of %0athe white vine, 9 and use it as an application for the eye-lids ; %0afirst pulling out such eye-lashes as are in the way, and then %0adropping the preparation with the point of a needle into the %0aplaces from which the hairs have been removed.

The gall, also, of the bacchus, 14 by some %0aknown as the " myxon," is equally good ; as also that of the %0acallionymus, 16 injected into the ears with oil of roses, or else %0aeastoreum, 16 used with poppy-juice. There are certain animals %0atoo, known as "sea-lice," 17 which are recommended as an %0ainjection for the ears, beaten up with vinegar. Wool, too, %0athat has been dyed with the juice of the murex, employed %0aby itself, is highly useful for this purpose ; some persons, %0ahowever moisten it with vinegar and nitre. 18 %0a%0aOthers, again, more particularly recommend for all affections %0aof the ears one cyathus of the best garum, 19 with one cyathus %0aand a half of honey, and one cyathus of vinegar, the whole %0agently boiled in a new pot over a slow fire, and skimmed with %0aa feather every now and then : when it has become wholly %0afree from scum, it is injected lukewarm into the ears. In %0acases where the ears are swollen, the same authorities recom- %0amend that the swellings should be first reduced with juice of %0acoriander. The fat of frogs, injected into the ears, instantly %0aremoves all pains in these organs. The juice of river-crabs, %0akneaded up with barley-meal, is a most effectual remedy for %0awounds in the ears.

REMEDIES FOR TOOTH-ACnE. THE DOG-FISH : FOUR %0a%0aREMEDIES. WHALE'S FLESH. %0a%0aTooth-ache is alleviated by scarifying the gums with bones %0aof the sea-dragon, or by rubbing the teeth once a year with %0athe brains of a dog-fish 21 boiled in oil, and kept for the purpose. %0aIt is a very good plan too, for the cure of tooth-ache, to lance %0athe gums with the sting of the pastinaca" in some cases. %0aThis sting, too, is pounded, and applied to the teeth with white %0ahellebore, having the effect of extracting them without the %0aslightest difficulty. Another of these remedies is, ashes of %0asalted fish calcined in an earthen vessel, mixed with powdered %0amarble. Stale cybium, 23 rinsed in a new earthen vessel, and %0athen pounded, is very useful for the cure of tooth-ache. %0aEqually good, it is said, are the back-bones of all kinds of salt %0afish, pounded and applied in a liniment. A decoction is made of %0aa single frog boiled in one hemina of vinegar, and the teeth %0aare rinsed with it, the decoction being retained in the mouth. %0aIn cases where a repugnance existed to making use of this %0aremedy, Sallustius Dionysius 24 used to suspend frogs over %0aboiling vinegar by the hind legs, so as to make them discharge %0atheir humours into the vinegar by the mouth, using consider- %0aable numbers of frogs for the purpose : to those, however, who %0ahad a stronger stomach, he prescribed the frogs themselves, %0aeaten with their broth. It is generally thought, too, that %0athis recipe applies more particularly to the double teeth, and %0athat the vinegar prepared as above-mentioned, is remarkably %0auseful for strengthening them when loose. %0a%0aFor this last purpose, some persons cut off the legs of two %0afrogs, and then macerate the bodies in two hemina) of wine, %0arecommending this preparation as a collutory for strengthening %0aloose teeth. Others attach the frogs, whole, to the exterior of %0athe jaws i 25 and with some it is the practice to boil ten frogs, %0a%0a20 See Note 89 to Chapter 23 of this Book. %0a%0a21 "Canicula."

By certain autho- %0arities, too, it has been recommended to boil the hearts of six- %0aand-thirty frogs beneath a copper vessel, in one sextarius of old %0aoil, and then to inject the decoction into the ear on the same %0aside of the jaw as the part affected : while others again have %0aused, as an application for the teeth, a frog's liver, boiled, and %0abeaten up with honey. All the preparations above described %0awill be found still more efficacious if made from the sea- %0afrog. 25 In cases where the teeth are carious and emit an %0aoffensive smell, it is recommended to dry some whale's 27 flesh %0ain an oven for a night, and then to add an equal quantity of %0asalt, and use the mixture as a dentifrice. " Enhydris" 28 is the %0aname given by the Greeks to a snake that lives in the water. %0aWith the four upper teeth of this reptile, it is the practice, for %0athe cure of aching in the upper teeth, to lance the upper gums, %0aand with the four lower teeth, for aching in the lower. Some %0apersons, however, content themselves with using an eyetooth %0aonly. Ashes, too, of burnt crabs are used for this purpose; %0aand the murex, reduced to ashes, makes an excellent den- %0atifrice. %0a%0aCHAP. 27. — REMEDIES FOE. LICHENS, AND FOE SPOTS UPON THE %0aFACE.

To the genus %0a" murex" belong the shell-fish known by the Greeks as " co- %0aluthia" or " coryphia," equally turbinated, but considerably %0asmaller : for all the above purposes they are still more effica- %0acious, and the use of them tends to preserve the sweetness of %0athe breath. Fish-glue 34 effaces wrinkles and plumps out the skin; %0abeing boiled for the purpose in water some four hours, and then %0apounded and kneaded up till it attains a thin consistency, like %0athat of honey. After being thus prepared, it is put by in a new %0avessel for keeping ; and, when wanted for use, is mixed, in %0athe proportion of four drachmae, with two drachma? of sulphur, %0atwo of alkanet, and eight of litharge ; the whole beiDg %0asprinkled with water and beaten up together. The prepara- %0ation is then applied to the face, and is washed off at the end %0aof four hours. For the cure of freckles and other affections %0aof the face, calcined bones of cuttle-fish are also used ; an %0aapplication which is equally good for the removal of fleshy %0aexcrescences and the dispersion of running sores. %0a%0a(8.) For the cure of itch-scab, a frog is boiled in five semisex- %0atarii of sea-water, the decoction being reduced to the consistency %0aof honey. There is a sea production called " halcyon eum," com- %0aposed, as some think, of the nests 35 of the birds known as the %0a"halcyon" 36 and "ceyx," or, according to others, of the con- %0acretion of sea-foam, or of some slime of the sea, or a certain %0alanuginous inflorescence thrown up by it. Of this halcyoneum %0athere are four different kinds ; the first, of an ashy colour, of a %0acompact substance, and possessed of a pungent odour ; the %0asecond, soft, of a milder nature, and with a smell almost iden- %0a%0a34 " Icthyocolla." See Chapter 24 of the present Book. %0a%0a33 Of course this assertion as to the nest of the kingfisher is altogether %0afahulous, and the sea-productions here described by Pliny were lon» con- %0asidered, though destitute of leaves, flowers, and fruit, to belong to the %0avegetable kingdom.

The best of all is %0athat which nearty borders upon a purple hue, and is known as %0athe " Milesian" kind : the whiter it is, the less highly it is %0aesteemed. %0a%0aThe properties of halcyoneum are ulcerative and detergent : %0awhen required for use, it is parched and applied without oil . %0aIt is quite marvellous how efficiently it removes leprous sores, %0alichens, and freckles, used in combination with lupines and %0atwo oboli of sulphur. It is employed, also, for the removal %0aof marks upon the eyes. 37 Andreas 38 has recommended for the %0acure of leprosy ashes of burnt crabs, with oil ; and Attalus, 39 %0afresh fat of tunny. %0a%0aCHAP. 28. — REMEDIES FOR SCROFULA, IMPOSTHTTMES OF THE PA- %0aROTID GLANDS, aUINSY, AND DISEASES OF THE FAUCES.

The same %0aproperty, too, belongs to the sting of the pastinaca, and to the %0asea-hare, applied topically to the sores : but in both cases due %0acare must be taken to remove them in an instant. Shells of %0asea-urchins are bruised, also, and applied with vinegar ; shells %0aalso of sea-scolopendrae, 42 applied with honey ; and river-crabs %0apounded or calcined, and applied with honey.

Nay, %0aeven more than this, fragments of earthen vessels in which %0asalt fish have been kept are pounded with stale axle-grease, %0aand applied to scrofulous sores and imposthumes of the parotid %0aglands ; as also calcined murex, incorporated with oil. Stiffness %0ain the neck is allayed by taking what are known as sea-lice, 43 ' %0ain doses of one drachma in drink, taking castoreum 44 mixed %0awith pepper in honied wine, or making a decoction of frogs in %0aoil and salt, and taking the liquor. %0a%0aOpisthotony, too, and tetanus are treated in a similar manner; %0aand spasms, with the addition of pepper. Ashes of burnt %0aheads of salted maenoe are applied externally, with honey, for the %0acure of quinsy ; as also a decoction of frogs, boiled in vinegar, %0aa preparation which is equally good for affections of the tonsil- %0alary glands.

The proper way of cooking them is with %0adill, parsley, coriander, and leeks, with the addition of oil and %0asalt. Stale cybium, 66 too, acts as a purgative, and is particularly %0auseful for carrying on 0 crudities, pituitous humours, and bile. %0a%0aThe myax 57 is of a purgative nature, a shell-fish of which %0awe shall take this opportunity of giving the natural his- %0atory at length. These fish collect together in masses, like the %0aiuurex, 58 and are found in spots covered with sea-weed. They %0aare the finest eating in autumn, and are found in the greatest %0aperfection in places where fresh-water streams discharge them- %0aselves into the sea ; for which reason it is that those of Egypt %0aare held in such high esteem. As the winter advances, they %0acontract a bitter flavour, and assume a reddish hue. The %0aliquor of these fish, it is said, acts as a purgative upon the %0abowels and bladder, has a detergent effect upon the intestines, %0aacts aperiently upon all the passages, purges the kidneys, and %0adiminishes the blood and adipose secretions. Hence it is that %0athese shell-fish are found of the greatest use for the treatment %0aof dropsy, for the regulation of the catamenia, and for the re- %0amoval of jaundice, all diseases of the joints, and flatulency. %0aThey are very good, also, for the reduction of obesity, for %0adiseases of the bile and of the pituitous secretions, for affec- %0ations of the lungs, liver, and spleen, and for rheumatic de- %0afluxions. The only inconvenience resulting from them is, that %0athey irritate the throat and impede the articulation. They %0ahave, also, a healing effect upon ulcers of a serpiginous nature, %0aor which stand in need of detergents, as also upon carcinoma- %0atous sores. Calcined, the same way as the murex, and em- %0aployed with honey, they are curative of bites inflicted either %0aby dogs or human beings, and of leprous spots or freckles. The %0aashes of them, rinsed, are good for the removal of films upon %0athe eyes, granulations of those organs and indurations of the %0amembrane, as also for diseases of the gums and teeth, and for %0apituitous eruptions. They serve, also, as an antidote to doryc- %0anium 59 and to opocarpathon. 60 %0a%0a56 Sliced tunny.

The %0aashes, also, of the mitulus, like those of the murex, are pos- %0asessed of certain caustic properties, and are very useful for the %0aremoval of leprous spots, freckles, and blemishes of the skin. %0aThey are rinsed, too, in the same manner as lead, 63 for the %0aremoval of swellings of the eyelids, of indurations of the %0amembranes, and of films upon the eyes, as also of sordid ulcers %0aupon other parts of the body, and of pustules upon the head. %0aThe meat of them, also, is employed as an application for bites %0ainflicted by dogs. %0a%0aAs to pelorides, 64 they act as a gentle laxative upon the %0abowels, an effect equally produced by castoreum, taken in doses %0aof two drachmae, in hydromel : where, however, a more drastic %0apurgative is recpiired, one drachma of dried garden-cucumber %0aroot is added, and two drachmae of aphronitrum. 69 The %0atethea 66 is good for griping pains in the bowels and for attacks %0aof flatulency : they are generally found adhering to the leaves %0aof marine plants, sucking their nutriment therefrom, and may %0abe rather looked upon as a sort of fungus than as a fish. They %0aare useful, also, for the removal of tenesmus and of diseases of %0athe kidneys. %0a%0aThere grows also in the sea a kind of absinthium, known by %0asome persons as " seriphum," 67 and found in the vicinity of %0aTaposiris, 68 in Egypt, more particularly. It is of a more %0aslender form than the land absinthium, acts as a purgative %0aupon the bowels, and effectually removes intestinal worms. %0aThe ssepia, too, is a laxative ; for which purpose these fish are %0a%0a61 Identical with our mussel, probably. %0a%0a62 Holland identifies this with the cockle, but it is probably a smaller %0akind of mussel. 63 See B. xxxiv. c. 50. %0a%0a61 We learn from Chapter 53 of this Book, that one class of the %0a"Cbamae," or gaping cockles, was known as "Pelorides."

The flesh, too, of %0athe sea-urchin, taken as food, is very useful as a remedy for %0athe same malady. %0a%0aScallops 87 also, taken as food, act detergently upon the blad- %0ader : the male fish is by some persons called " donax," and br- %0aothers " aulos," the female being known as " onyx." 88 The %0a%0a80 Rondelet, B. vi. c. 19, suggests " capite" — "in the head" — hut the %0apresent reading is supported by the text of Plinius Valerianus, B. ii. c. 39, %0aand of Marcus Empiricus, c. 28. %0a%0a81 As to the identity of the Enhydris, see Chapters 19 and 26 of the %0apresent Book : also B. xxx. c. 8. %0a%0a82 Probably the BXtvvbz of Oppian, B. i. c. 108.

On the other hand, %0athe fish mentioned by Oppian is thought by Littre to be the "gobius" %0aof the Latins, ("gobio" or "cobio," mentioned by Pliny in B. ix. c. 83, %0aand in c. 53 of the present Book), which is generally considered the same %0aas our gudgeon, and was a worthless fish, " vilis piscis," as Juvenal says. %0aOne of the Linnaean orders of fishes is called "Blennius," the blenny. %0a%0a%3c» See B. ix. c. 28. 84 See B. ix. c. 68. %0a%0a85 Or sea-lungs.

The sea-scorpion," %0atoo, is used for the same purpose, boiled in wine, and applied %0aas a fomentation to the part affected. Shells of sea-urchins, %0abruised and applied with water, act as a check upon incipient %0ainflammatory tumours. Ashes of the murex, or of the purple, %0aare employed in either case, whether it is wanted to disperse %0ainflammatory tumours in an incipient state, or to bring them %0ato a head and break them. Some authorities prescribe the fol- %0alowing preparation : of wax and frankincense twenty drachma?, %0aof litharge forty drachmae, of calcined murex ten drachmae, %0aand of old oil, one semisextarius. Salt fish, boiled and ap- %0aplied by itself, is highly useful for the above purposes. %0a%0aRiver crabs, bruised and applied, disperse pustules on the %0agenerative organs : the same, too, with calcined heads of %0amaenae, 1 or the flesh of that fish, boiled and applied. Heads %0aof salted perch, 2 reduced to ashes, and applied with honey, are %0aequally useful for the purpose ; or else calcined heads of pe- %0alamides, 3 or skin of the squatina reduced to ashes. 4 It is the %0askin of this fish that is used, as already 5 stated, for giving a %0apolish to wood ; for the sea even, we find, furnishes its aid to our %0aartificers. For a similar purpose the fishes called " smarides" 6 %0aare applied topically ; as also ashes of the shell of the murex %0aor of the purple, applied with honey ; which last are still more %0aefficacious when the flesh has been burnt with the shell. %0a%0aSalt fish, boiled with honey, is particularly good for the %0acure of carbuncles upon the generative organs.

Some persons, again, suffocate %0afrogs in oil, and, after attaching them to the patient without %0ahis knowing it, anoint him with the oil. The heart of a frog, %0aworn as an amulet, modifies the cold chills in fevers ; the %0asame, too, with oil in which the intestines of frogs have been %0aboiled. But the best remedy for quartan fevers, is to wear %0aattached to the body either frogs from which the claws have %0abeen 29 removed, or else the liver or heart of a bramble-frog, 30 %0aattached in a piece of russet-coloured cloth. %0a%0aRiver-crabs, 31 bruised in oil and water, are highly beneficial %0ain fevers, the patient being anointed with the preparation just %0abefore the paroxysms come on : some authorities recommend %0athe addition of pepper to the mixture. Others prescribe for %0aquartan fevers a decoction of river-crabs in wine, boiled down %0ato one fourth, the patient taking it at the moment of leaving %0athe bath : by some, too, it is recommended to swallow the left %0aeye of a river-crab. The magicians engage to cure a tertian %0afever, by attaching as an amulet to the patient, before sunrise, %0athe eyes of river-crabs, the crabs when thus blinded being set %0aat liberty in the water. They say, too, that these eyes, attached %0ato the body in a piece of deer's hide, with the flesh of a %0anightingale, 32 will dispel sleep and promote watchfulness. In %0acases where there are symptoms of lethargy, the rennet of the %0abalsena 33 or of the sea-calf 34 is given to the patient to smell ; %0asome persons, too, use the blood of tortoises as a liniment for %0alethargic patients. %0a%0aTertian fevers, it is said, may be cured by wearing one of %0athe vertebrae 35 of a perch attached to the body, and quartan %0afevers by using fresh river snails, as an aliment.

The polyp, 44 bruised and applied, arrests haemorrhage, %0ait is thought: in addition to which we find stated the follow- %0aing particulars respecting it — that of itself it emits a sort of %0abrine, in consequence of which, there is no necessity to use %0aany in cooking it — that it should always be sliced with a reed %0a— "and that it is spoilt by using an iron knife, becoming tainted %0athereby, owing to the antipathy 45 which naturally exists %0a[between it and iron]. For the purpose also of arresting %0aheemorrhage, ashes of burnt frogs are applied topically, or else %0athe dried blood of those animals. Some authorities recom- %0amend the frog to be used, that is known by the Greeks as %0a" calamites," 46 from the fact that it lives among reeds 47 and %0ashrubs ; it is the smallest and greenest of all the frogs, and %0aeither the blood or the ashes of it are recommended to be em- %0aployed.

Still, however, there is this inconvenience attend- %0aing them — when they have been once applied, they create a %0anecessity 60 for having recourse to the same treatment at about %0athe same period in every succeeding year. Many physicians %0ahave been of opinion also, that leeches may be successfully ap- %0aplied in cases of gout. When gorged, they fall off in conse- %0aquence of losing their hold through the weight of the blood, %0abut if not, they must be sprinkled with salt 81 for the purpose. %0a%0aLeeches are apt, however, to leave their heads buried in the %0aflesh ; the consequence of which is an incurable wound, which %0ahas caused death in many cases, that of Messalinus, 52 for ex- %0aample, a patrician of consular rank, after an application of %0aleeches to his knee. When this is the case, that which was %0aintended as a remedy is turned into an active poison ; 53 a result %0awhich is to be apprehended in using the red leeches more %0aparticularly. Hence it is that when these last are employed, %0ait is the practice to snip them with a pair of scissors while %0asucking ; the consequence of which is, that the blood oozes %0aforth, through a siphon, as it were, and the head, gradually %0acontracting as the animal dies, is not left behind in the wound. %0aThere is a natural antipathy 54 existing between leeches and %0abugs, and hence it is that the latter are killed by the aid %0aof a fumigation made with leeches. Ashes of beaver-skin %0aburnt with tar, kneaded up with leek-juice, arrest bleeding at %0athe nostrils. %0a%0aCHAP. 43. — METHODS OF EXTRACTING FOREIGN BODIES FROM %0aTHE FLESH. %0a%0aTo extract pointed weapons which have pierced the flesh, %0aashes of calcined shells of the ssepia are used, as also of the %0a%0a48 "Bloodsuckers." *» " Cucurbitae medicinales." %0a%0a511 This does not appear to he considered the case at the present day. %0aSl A method still employed. 52 See B.

Ashes of sea-crabs, cal- %0acined with lead, arrest the progress of carcinomatous sores ; a %0apurpose for which ashes of river-crabs, in combination with %0ahoney and fine lint, are equally useful : though there are some %0aauthorities which prefer mixing alum and barley with the %0aashes. Phagedenic ulcers are cured by an application of %0adried silurus pounded with sandarach ; 61 malignant cancers, %0acorrosive ulcers, and putrid 6ores, by the agency of stale %0acybium. 62 %0a%0aMaggots that breed in sores are removed by applying frogs' %0agall; and fistulas are opened and dried by introducing a tent %0amade of salt fish, with a dossil of lint. Salt fish, kneaded up %0aand applied in the form of a plaster, will remove all proud %0aflesh in the course of a day, and will arrest the further pro- %0agress of putrid and serpiginous ulcers.

River-crabs, 82 bruised in wine, and taken %0ainternally, arrest menstruation. The silurus, 83 that of Africa 81 %0amore particularly, used as a fumigation, facilitates parturition, %0ait is said. Crabs, taken in water, arrest menstruation ; but %0aused with hyssop, they act as an emmenagogue, we are told. %0aIn cases, too, where the infant is in danger of suffocation at %0athe moment of delivery, a similar drink, administered to the %0amother, is highly efficacious. Crabs, too, either fresh or dried, %0aare taken in drink, for the purpose of preventing abortion. %0aHippocrates 85 prescribes them as a promoter of menstruation, %0aand as an expellent of the dead foetus, beaten up with five 88 %0aroots of lapathum and rue and some soot, and administered %0ain honied wine.

If, however, a female in a state of pregnancy %0ashould happen to step over castoreum, or over the beaver itself, %0aabortion, it is said, will be the sure result : so, too, if casto- %0areum is only held over a pregnant woman's head, there will be %0agreat danger of miscarriage. %0a%0aThere is a very marvellous fact, too, that I find stated in %0areference to the torpedo : 90 if it is caught at the time that the %0amoon is in Libra, and kept in the open air for three days, it %0awill always facilitate parturition, as often as it is introduced %0ainto the apartment of a woman in labour. The sting, too, of %0athe pastinaca, 91 attached to the navel, is generally thought to %0ahave the property of facilitating delivery : it must be taken, %0ahowever, from the fish while alive ; which done, the fish must %0abe returned to the sea. I find it stated by some authorities that %0athere is a substance called " ostraceum," which is also spoken %0aof as " onyx " 92 by others ; that, used as a fumigation, it is %0awonderfully beneficial for suffocations of the uterus ; that in %0asmell it resembles castoreum, and is still more efficacious, if %0aburnt with this last substance ; and that in a calcined state it %0ahas the property of healing inveterate ulcers, and cancerous %0asores of a malignant nature. As to carbuncles and carcino- %0amatous sores upon the secret parts of females, there is nothing %0amore efficacious, it is said, than a female crab beaten up, just %0aafter full moon, with flower of salt 95 and applied with water. %0a%0aCHAP. 47. — METHODS OF REMOVING SUPERFLUOUS HAIR. %0a%0aDEPILATORIES. • %0a%0aDepilatories are prepared from the blood, gall, and liver of the %0atunny, either fresh or preserved ; as also from pounded liver of %0athe same fish, preserved with cedar resin 94 in a leaden box; a re- %0a%0a89 See B. xii. c. 57 . 90 See B. ix. cc. 24, 48, 74, 75. %0a%0a•J Or sting-ray.

THE %0aINK OF THE S^PIA.* %0a%0aAmong the aquatic productions ought also to be mentioned %0acalamochnos, in Latin known as " adarea," 19 a substance which %0acollects about small reeds, from a mixture of the foam of fresh %0aand of sea water. It possesses certain caustic properties, and %0ahence it is that it is so useful as an ingredient in " acopa" 20 %0aand as a remedy for cold shiverings ; it is used too, for remov- %0aing freckles upon the face of females. And now we are %0aspeaking of adarca, the reed ought equally to be mentioned. The %0aroot of that known as the " phragmites," 21 pounded fresh, is %0acurative of sprains, and, applied topically with vinegar, re- %0amoves pains in the spine. The calcined bark, too, of the %0aCyprian 22 reed, known as the " donax," is curative of alopecy %0aand inveterate ulcers ; and its leaves are good for the extrac- %0ation of foreign bodies adhering to the flesh, and for the cure %0aof erysipelas : should, however, the flower of the panicle happen %0ato enter the ears, deafness 23 is the consequence. %0a%0aThe ink of the ssepia 24 is possessed of such remarkable po- %0atency, that if it is put into a lamp, Anaxilaus tells us, the light %0awill become entirely changed, 25 and all present will look %0aas black as ^Ethiopians. The bramble-frog, boiled in water, %0aand given to swine with their drink, is curative of the maladies %0awith which they are affected ; an effect equally produced by %0athe ashes of any other kind of frog.

These animals, it is generally considered, %0aembrace one hundred and seventy-six different 28 species, and it %0awill be my object to set them forth, each by its distinct name, %0aa thing that caunot possibly be done in reference to the terres- %0atrial animals and the birds. %0a%0aFor, in fact, we are by no means acquainted with all the %0awild beasts or all the birds that are to be found in India, iEthi- %0aopia, Scythia, or the desert regions of the earth ; and even of %0aman himself there are numerous varieties, which as yet we %0ahave been unable 29 to make ourselves acquainted with. In ad- %0adition, too, to the various countries above mentioned, we have %0aTaprobane 30 and other isles of the Ocean, about which so many %0afabulous stories are related. Surely then, every one must allow %0athat it is quite impossible to comprise every species of animal in %0aone general view for the information of mankind. And yet, by %0aHercules ! in the sea and in the Ocean, vast as it is, there exists %0anothing that is unknown to us, 31 and, a truly marvellous fact, %0ait is with those things which Nature has concealed in the deep %0athat we are the best acquainted ! %0a%0aTo begin then with the monsters 32 that are found in this ele- %0a%0a27 This seems to be the meaning of "adeo ut baculura ita prfeluceat." %0a%0a28 Some MSS. have here " 164," the Bamberg MS. and others " 144." %0aOwing to the corrupt state of the text in many parts of this Chapter, it is %0aimpossible to say which reading is correct. %0a%0a29 " Invenire noa potuimus " seems a preferable reading to " invenire %0apotuimus." %0a%0a3° Modern Ceylon.

The helops, he %0asays, is unknown to our waters ; from which it would appear %0athat those are in error who look upon it as identical with our %0aacipenser. 26 Many persons have given the preference to the %0ahelops before all other. fish, in point of flavour. %0a%0aThere are several fishes also, which have been mentioned by %0ano author; such, for instance, as the one called "sudis" by %0athe Latins, and "sphyrene" by the Greeks, names which in- %0adicate the peculiar form of its muzzle. 27 It is one of the very %0alargest kinds, but rarely found, and by no means of inferior %0aflavour. " Perna," too, is the name given to a kind of shell- %0afish, found in vast numbers in the vicinity of the islands of the %0aEuxine. These fish are found firmly planted in the sand, re- %0asembling in appearance the long shank 28 of a hog. Opening %0awide their shells, where there is sufficient space, they lie in %0await for their prey ; this opening being not less than a foot in %0abreadth, and the edges of it garnished around with teeth %0aclosely set, much resembling the teeth of a comb in form. %0aWithin the shell, the meat consists of a vast lump of flesh. %0aI once saw, too, a fish called the " hyaena," 29 which had been %0acaught off the island of JEnaria. 30 %0a%0aIn addition to these animals, there are certain excretions %0athrown up by the sea, which do not merit any further notice, %0aand indeed ought to be reckoned among the sea-weeds, rather %0athan looked upon as animated beings. %0a%0aSummary. — Remedies, narratives, and observations, nine %0ahundred and ninety. %0a%0aRoman Authors quoted. — Licinius Macer, 31 Trebius Niger, 32 %0a%0a23 See B. ix. c. 25. 2 * See B. ix. c. 47 %0a%0a25 See B. ix. c. 42. %0a%0a56 See B. ix. c. 27.

(1.) — THE POWER OF NATURE AS MANIFESTED IN ANTI- %0a%3c PATHIES. THE ECHENE1S : TWO REMEDIES. %0a%3c %0a%3c Following the proper order of things, we have now arrived %0a%3c at the culminating point of the wonders manifested to us by %0a%3c the operations of Nature. And even at the very outset, we %0a%3c find spontaneously presented to us an incomparable illustration %0a%3c of her mysterious powers : so much so, in fact, that beyond it %0a%3c we feel ourselves bound to forbear extending our enquiries, %0a%3c there being nothing to be found either equal or analogous to an %0a%3c element in which Nature quite triumphs over herself, and that, %0a%3c too, in such numberless ways. For what is there more unruly %0a%3c than the sea, with its winds, its tornadoes, and its tempests ? %0a%3c And yet in what department of her works has Nature been %0a%3c more seconded by the ingenuity of man, than in this, by his %0a%3c inventions of sails and of oars ? In addition to this, we are %0a%3c struck with the ineffable might displayed by the Ocean's tides, %0a%3c %0a%3c 1 It is in the last six Books of Pliny, and those only, we regret to say, %0a%3c that we are enabled to avail ourselves of the new readings of the Bamberg %0a%3c MS., which has been so admirably collated by M. Ian. In a vast number %0a%3c of passages previously looked upon as hopelessly corrupt, or else not at all %0a%3c suspected of being in a mutilated state, this MS. supplies words and clauses, %0a%3c the existence of which in the original was hitherto unknown ; indeed by its %0a%3c aid the indefatigable Sillig has been enabled, if we may be allowed tbe %0a%3c term, almost to rewrite tbe last six Books of Pliny. From a perusal of %0a%3c these new readings, as Dr. Smith has justly remarked, we have reason to %0a%3c infer " that the text of the earlier Books is still in a very defective state, %0a%3c and that much of the obscurity of Pliny may be traced to this cause." %0a%3c %0a%3c VOL. "VI. B %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 2 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c flint's natural history. [Book XXXII. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c as they constantly ebb and flow, and so regulate the currents %0a%3c of the sea as though they were the waters of one vast river. %0a%3c %0a%3c And yet all these forces, though acting in unison, and impel- %0a%3c ling in the same direction, a single fish, and that of a very %0a%3c diminutive size — the fish known as the " echene'is" 2 — pos- %0a%3c sesses the power of counteracting. Winds may blow and %0a%3c storms may rage, and yet the echene'is controls their fury, %0a%3c restrains their mighty force, and bids ships stand still in their %0a%3c career ; a result which no cables, no anchors, from their pon- %0a%3c derousness quite incapable of being weighed, could ever have %0a%3c produced ! A fish bridles the impetuous violence of the deep, %0a%3c and subdues the frantic rage of the universe — and all this by %0a%3c no effort of its own, no act of resistance on its part, no act at %0a%3c all, in fact, but that of adhering to the bark ! Trifling as this %0a%3c object would appear, it suffices to counteract all these forces %0a%3c combined, and to forbid the ship to pass onward in its way ! %0a%3c Fleets, armed for war, pile up towers and bulwarks on their %0a%3c decks, in order that, upon the deep even, men may fight from %0a%3c behind ramparts as it were. But alas for human vanity ! — %0a%3c when their prows, beaked as they are with brass and with %0a%3c iron, 3 and armed for the onset, can thus be arrested and %0a%3c rivetted to the spot by a little fish, no more than some half %0a%3c foot in length ! %0a%3c %0a%3c At the battle of Actium, it is said, a fish of this kind stopped %0a%3c the praetorian ship 4 of Antonius in its course, at the moment that %0a%3c he was hastening from ship to ship to encourage and exhort his %0a%3c men, and so compelled him to leave it and go on board another. %0a%3c Hence it was, that the fleet of Caesar gained the advantage 5 in %0a%3c the onset, and charged with a redoubled impetuosity. In our %0a%3c own time, too, one of these fish arrested the ship of the Em- %0a%3c peror 6 Caius in its course, when he was returning from Astura %0a%3c to Antium : 7 and thus, as the result proved, did an insignificant %0a%3c fish give presage of great events ; for no sooner had the em- %0a%3c peror returned to Rome than he was pierced by the weapons of %0a%3c his own soldiers.

The moment this %0a%3c was discovered, some of the sailors plunged into the sea, and, %0a%3c on making search about the ship's sides, they found an %0a%3c echene'is adhering to the rudder. Upon its being shown to %0a%3c the emperor, he strongly expressed his indignation that such %0a%3c an obstacle as this should have impeded his progress, and have %0a%3c rendered powerless the hearty endeavours of some four hun- %0a%3c dred men. One thing, too, it is well known, more particularly %0a%3c surprised 3 him, how it was possible that the fish, while ad- %0a%3c hering to the ship, should arrest its progress, and yet should %0a%3c have no such power when brought on board. %0a%3c %0a%3c According to the persons who examined it on that occasion, %0a%3c and who have seen it since, the echene'is bears a strong resem- %0a%3c blance to a large slug. 9 The various opinions entertained %0a%3c respecting it we have already 10 noticed, when speaking of it %0a%3c in the Natural History of Fishes. There is no doubt, too, that %0a%3c all fish of this kind are possessed of a similar power ; witness, %0a%3c for example, the well-known instance of the shells 11 which %0a%3c are still preserved and consecrated in the Temple of Venus at %0a%3c Cnidos, and which, we are bound to believe, once gave such %0a%3c striking evidence of the possession of similar properties. %0a%3c Some of our own authors have given this fish the Latin name %0a%3c of " mora." 12 It is a singular thing, but among the Greeks %0a%3c we find writers who state that, worn as an amulet, the eche- %0a%3c ne'is has the property, 13 as already mentioned, of preventing mis- %0a%3c carriage, and of reducing procidence of the uterus, and so per- %0a%3c mitting the foetus to reach maturity : while others, again, %0a%3c assert that, if it is preserved in salt and worn as an amulet, it %0a%3c will facilitate parturition ; a fact to which it is indebted for %0a%3c %0a%3c 8 And well it might surprise him. If there was any foundation at all %0a%3c for the story, there can be little doubt that a trick was played for the pur- %0a%3c pose of imposing upon Caligula's superstitious credulity, and that the %0a%3c rowers as well as the diving sailors were privy to it. %0a%3c %0a%3c 9 " Liinax." A singular comparison, apparently. %0a%3c M In B. ix. c. 41. %0a%3c %0a%3c 11 See B. ix. c. 41, where he is speaking of a murex, a fish which bears %0a%3c no such affinity to the remora as to warrant our author's expression, %0a%3c " Idem valere omnia ea genera." %0a%3c %0a%3c 12 Properly meaning "delay." "Remora" is another reading, and %0a%3c perhaps a better one, as the word is found in Plautus. %0a%3c %0a%3c " In B. ix. c. 41. %0a%3c %0a%3c B 2 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 4 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c pliny's natural history. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XXXII. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c another name which it bears, " odinolytes." 14 Be all this as %0a%3c it may, considering this most remarkable fact of a ship being %0a%3c thus stopped in its course, who can entertain a doubt as to the %0a%3c possibility of any manifestation of her power by Nature, or %0a%3c as to the effectual operation of the remedies which she has %0a%3c centred in her spontaneous productions ? %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 2. THE TORPEDO : NI3S T E REMEDIES. %0a%3c %0a%3c And then, besides, even if we had not this illustration by %0a%3c the agency of the echeneis, would it not have been quite suf- %0a%3c ficient only to cite the instance of the torpedo, 15 another in- %0a%3c habitant also of the sea, as a manifestation of the mighty %0a%3c powers of Nature ? From a considerable distance even, and if %0a%3c only touched with the end of a spear or staff, this fish has the %0a%3c property of benumbing even the most vigorous arm, and of %0a%3c rivetting the feet of the runner, however swift he may be in %0a%3c the race. If, upon considering this fresh illustration, we find %0a%3c ourselves compelled to admit that there is in existence a certain %0a%3c power which, by the very exhalations 16 and, as it were, emana- %0a%3c tions therefrom, is enabled to affect the members of the hu- %0a%3c man body, 17 what are we not to hope for from the remedial %0a%3c influences which Nature has centred in all animated beings ? %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 3. THE SEA HAKE : FIVE REMEDIES. %0a%3c %0a%3c No less wonderful, too, are the particulars which we find %0a%3c stated relative to the sea-hare. 18 Taken with the food or %0a%3c drink, it is a poison to some persons ; while to others, again, %0a%3c the very sight of it is venomous. 19 Indeed, if a woman in a %0a%3c %0a%3c u From \t5fiv rag uidivae, "to release from the pains of childbirth." %0a%3c " See B. ix. c. 67. %0a%3c %0a%3c 16 Ajasson remarks that it was owing probably to this opinion that it %0a%3c was formerly the belief, that by holding the breath a person could render %0a%3c himself proof against the shock of the torpedo ; a precaution recommended %0a%3c by Kaempfer, in his " Amenitates Exotica?," p, 514. Ed. 1712. %0a%3c %0a%3c 17 " Quadam aura sui corporis adficiat membra" seems a preferable %0a%3c reading to " Quadam aura corporis sui adficiat membra," as given by the %0a%3c Bamberg MS., and adopted by Sillig. %0a%3c %0a%3c 18 See B. ix. c. 72, and the Note. %0a%3c %0a%3c '9 A fabulous story, Ajasson remarks, but one that was commonly be- %0a%3c lieved in the 16th and 17th centuries. Gessner, however, a conscientious %0a%3c enquirer into the mysteries of Nature, asserts (de Aquatilibus, p. 563) that, %0a%3c to his own knowledge, the sight of this fish was productive of the symp- %0a%3c toms here mentioned. Beckmann reckons the Aplysia depilana (with which %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 4.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c MAEVELS OF THE BED SEA. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 5 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c state of pregnancy so much as looks upon one of these fishes, %0a%3c she is immediately seized with nausea and vomiting — a proof %0a%3c that the injury has reached the stomach — and abortion is the %0a%3c ultimate result. The proper preservative against these bane- %0a%3c ful effects is the male fish, which is kept dried for the purpose %0a%3c in salt, and worn in a bracelet upon the arm. And yet this %0a%3c same fish, while in the sea, is not injurious, by its contact %0a%3c even. The only animal that eats it without fatal consequences, %0a%3c is the mullet the sole perceptible result being that its flesh %0a%3c is rendered more tender thereby, but deteriorated in flavour, %0a%3c and consequently not so highly esteemed. %0a%3c %0a%3c Persons when poisoned 21 by the sea-hare smell strongly of %0a%3c the fish — the first sign, indeed, by which the fact of their %0a%3c having been so poisoned is detected. Death also ensues at the %0a%3c end of as many days as the fish has lived : hence it is that, %0a%3c as Licinius Macer informs us, this is one of those poisons %0a%3c which have no definite time for their operation. In India, 22 we %0a%3c are assured, the sea-hare is never taken alive ; and, we are told %0a%3c that, in those parts of the world, man, in his turn, acts as a %0a%3c poison upon the fish, which dies instantly in the sea, if it is %0a%3c only touched with the human finger. There, like the rest %0a%3c of the animals, it attains a much larger size than it does %0a%3c with us. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 4. MAKVELS OF THE EED SEA. %0a%3c %0a%3c Juba, in those books descriptive of Arabia, which he has %0a%3c dedicated to Caius Caesar, the son of Augustus, informs us that %0a%3c there are mussels 23 on those coasts, the shells of which are %0a%3c capable of holding three semisextarii ; and that, on one occa- %0a%3c sion, a whale, 24 six hundred feet in length and three hundred %0a%3c and sixty feet broad, 26 made its way up a river of Arabia, %0a%3c %0a%3c the Sea-hare of the ancients is identified) in the numher of the animal %0a%3c poisons, and remarks that (as we find stated by Coelius Rhodiginus, B. %0a%3c xxvi. c. 30) the Emperor Titus was dispatched by the agencv of this %0a%3c poison, administered to him by the direction of his brother f)omitian. %0a%3c Hist.

(2.) — THE INSTINCTS OF FISHES. %0a%3c %0a%3c The statements which Ovid has made as to the instincts %0a%3c offish, in the work" of his known as the " Halieuticon," 28 %0a%3c appear to me truly marvellous. The scarus, 29 for instance, %0a%3c when enclosed in the wicker kype, makes no effort to escape %0a%3c with its head, nor does it attempt to thrust its muzzle between %0a%3c the oziers ; but turning its tail towards them, it enlarges the %0a%3c orifices with repeated blows therefrom, and so makes its escape %0a%3c backwards. Should, 30 too, another scarus, from without, chance %0a%3c to see it thus struggling within the kype, it will take the tail %0a%3c t of the other in its mouth, and so aid it in its efforts to escape. %0a%3c The lupus, 31 again, when surrounded with the net, furrows 32 %0a%3c the sand with its tail, and so conceals itself, until the net has %0a%3c passed over it. The muraena, 33 trusting in the slippery smooth- %0a%3c ness 34 of its rounded back, boldly faces the meshes of the net, %0a%3c and by repeatedly wriggling its body, makes its escape. The %0a%3c polyp 35 makes for the hooks, and, without swallowing the bait, %0a%3c clasps it with its feelers ; nor does it quit its hold until it has %0a%3c eaten off the bait, or perceives itself being drawn out of the %0a%3c water by the rod. %0a%3c %0a%3c The mullet, 36 too, is aware 37 that within the bait there is a %0a%3c hook concealed, and is on its guard against the ambush ; still %0a%3c however, so great is its voracity, that it beats the hook with %0a%3c its tail, and strikes away from it the bait. The lupus, 38 again, %0a%3c %0a%3c 2 6 See B. xi. c. 34. %0a%3c %0a%3c 27 Of this work, begun by Ovid during bis banishment in Pontus, and %0a%3c probably never completed, only a fragment of one hundred and thirty-two %0a%3c lines has come down to us.

The niu- %0a%3c raena 39 not only swallows the hook, but /catches at the line %0a%3c with its teeth, and so gnaws it asunder. The anthias, 40 Ovid %0a%3c says, the moment it finds itself caught by the hook, turns its %0a%3c body with its back downwards, upon which there is a sharp %0a%3c knife-like fin, and so cuts the line asunder. %0a%3c %0a%3c According to Licinius Macer, the mursena is of the female %0a%3c sex only, and is impregnated by serpents, as already 42 men- %0a%3c tioned ; and hence it is that the fishermen, to entice it from its %0a%3c retreat, and catch it, make a hissing noise in imitation of the %0a%3c hissing of a serpent. He states, also, that by frequently beat- %0a%3c ing the water it is made to grow fat, that a blow with a stout %0a%3c stick will not kill it, but that a touch with a stalk of fennel- %0a%3c giant 43 is instantly fatal. That in the case of this animal, the %0a%3c life is centred in the tail, there can be no doubt, as also that %0a%3c it dies immediately on that part of the body being struck ; %0a%3c while, on the other hand, there is considerable difficulty in %0a%3c killing it with a blow upon the head. Persons who have %0a%3c come in contact with the razor-fish 44 smell of iron, 45 The %0a%3c hardest of all fishes, beyond a doubt, is that known as the %0a%3c " orbis r" 46 it is spherical, destitute 46 * of scales, and all head. 47 %0a%3c %0a%3c 39 From the Halieuticon. 40 See B. ix. c. 85. %0a%3c %0a%3c 42 In B. ix. c. 39.

Pliny is the only ancient author that mentions %0a%3c this fish. There are numerous varieties of it, among which the hest known %0a%3c are the Coryphaena novacula of Linnaeus, the Bason of the Mediterranean, %0a%3c highly esteemed as an article of food, and the Coryphaena pentedactyle of %0a%3c Bloch, identical with the Hemipteronote a cinq taches, of Lacepede. %0a%3c %0a%3c 46 An absurdity, owing, no doubt, to its name. %0a%3c %0a%3c 46 Or "globe-fish."

At %0a%3c Hierapolis 56 in Syria, the fish in the Lake of Venus there obey %0a%3c the voice of the officers of the temple : bedecked with orna- %0a%3c ments of gold, they come at their call, fawn upon them while %0a%3c they are scratched, and open their mouths so wide as to admit %0a%3c of the insertion of the hands. %0a%3c %0a%3c Off the Rock of Hercules, in the territory of Stabiae 57 in %0a%3c Campania, the melanuri 58 seize with avidity bread that is thrown %0a%3c to them in the sea, but they will never approach any bait in %0a%3c which there is a hook concealed. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 9. — PLACES WHERE BITTER FISH ARE FOtTND, SALT, OR %0a%3c SWEET. %0a%3c %0a%3c Nor is it by any means the least surprising fact, that off the %0a%3c island of Pele, 59 the town of Clazomenae, 60 the rock 61 [of %0a%3c Scylla] in Sicily, and in the vicinity of Leptis in Africa, 62 %0a%3c Euboea, and Dyrrhachium, 63 the fish are bitter. In the neigh- %0a%3c bourhood of Cephallenia, Ampelos, Paros, and the rocks of %0a%3c Delos, the fish are so salt by nature that they might easily be %0a%3c taken to have been pickled in brine. In the harbour, again, %0a%3c of the last-mentioned island, the fish are sweet : differences, %0a%3c all of them, resulting, no doubt, from the diversity 64 of their %0a%3c food. %0a%3c %0a%3c Apion says that the largest among the fishes is the sea- %0a%3c pig, 65 known to the Lacedaemonians as the " orthagoriscos ;" %0a%3c %0a%3c 56 The seat of the worship of the half-fish goddess Addirga, Atergatis, %0a%3c Astarte, or Lerceto.

These %0a%3c accidental varieties in the natural flavour of fish — a thing that %0a%3c is still more surprising — may, in some cases, be owing to the %0a%3c nature of the locality; an apposite illustration of which is, the %0a%3c well-known fact that, at Beneventum 67 in Italy, salted provi- %0a%3c sions of all kinds require 68 to be salted over again. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 10. WHEN 8EA-FISH WERE FIRST EATEN BY THE PEOPLE OF %0a%3c %0a%3c ROME. THE ORBINANCE OF KING NUMA AS TO FISH. %0a%3c %0a%3c Cassius Hemina informs us that sea- fish have been in use %0a%3c at Rome from the time of its foundation. I will give his own %0a%3c words, however, upon the subject : — " Numa ordained that fish %0a%3c without 89 scales should not be served up at the Festivals of %0a%3c the Gods ; a piece of frugality, the intention of which was, %0a%3c that the banquets, both public and private, as well as the %0a%3c repasts laid before the couches™ of the gods, might be pro- %0a%3c vided at a smaller expense than formerly : it being also his %0a%3c wish to preclude the risk that the caterers for the sacred %0a%3c banquets would spare no expense in buying provisions, and so %0a%3c forestall the market." %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 11. — CORAL : FORTY- THREE REMEDIES AND OBSERVATIONS. %0a%3c %0a%3c In the same degree that people in our part of the world %0a%3c set a value upon the pearls of India — a subject on which we %0a%3c have already spoken 71 on the appropriate occasion at sufficient %0a%3c length — do the people of India prize coral : it being the %0a%3c prevailing taste in each nation respectively that constitutes %0a%3c the value of things. Coral is produced in the Red Sea also, %0a%3c %0a%3c 66 Ajasson thinks that this notion may possibly have been derived from %0a%3c the name, which not improbably was given to it from the spongy and %0a%3c oleaginous nature of the flesh. %0a%3c %0a%3c 67 See B. iii. c. 16. %0a%3c %0a%3c 68 Owing, perhaps, to the moisture of the atmosphere. %0a%3c %0a%3c 69 We learn from Festus, that he prohibited the use also of the scarus, %0a%3c a fish with scales. %0a%3c %0a%3c 70 " Ad pulvinaria." Literally, " At the cushions ;" in reference to %0a%3c the practice of placing the statues of the gods upon pillows at the Lectis- %0a%3c ternia, which were sacrifices in the nature of feasts, at which images of %0a%3c the gods were placed reclining on couches, with tables and food before %0a%3c them, as if they were really partaking of the things offered in sacrifice. %0a%3c Livy, B. v. c. 13. gives an account of a Lectisternium celebrated with great %0a%3c pomp, which he asserts to have been the first instance of the practice %0a%3c %0a%3c 71 In B. ix. c. 54. 1 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 11.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c COEAL. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 11 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c but of a more swarthy hue than ours. It is to be found also %0a%3c in the Persian Gulf, where it is known by the name of "iace." %0a%3c But the most highly-esteemed of all, is that produced in the %0a%3c vicinity of the islands called Stcechades, 72 in the Gallic Gulf, %0a%3c and near the JEolian Islands and the town of Drepana in the %0a%3c Sea of Sicily. Coral is to be found growing, too, at Graviscae, %0a%3c and off the coast of Neapolis in Campania : as also at Erythrae, %0a%3c where it is intensely red, but soft, and consequently little %0a%3c valued. %0a%3c %0a%3c Its form is that of a shrub, 73 and its colour green : its %0a%3c berries are white and soft while under water, but the moment %0a%3c they are removed from it, they become hard and red, resem- %0a%3c bling the berries of cultivated cornel in size and appearance. %0a%3c They say that, while alive, if it is only touched by a person, %0a%3c it will immediately become as hard as stone ; and hence it is %0a%3c that the greatest pains are taken to prevent this, by tearing it %0a%3c up from the bottom with nets, or else cutting it short with %0a%3c a sharp- edged instrument of iron : from which last circum- %0a%3c stance it is generally supposed to have received its name of %0a%3c " curalium." 74 The reddest coral and the most branchy is %0a%3c held in the highest esteem ; but, at the same time, it must %0a%3c not be rough or hard like stone ; nor yet, on the other hand, %0a%3c should it be full of holes or hollow. %0a%3c %0a%3c The berries of coral are no less esteemed by the men in India %0a%3c than are the pearls of that country by the females among us : %0a%3c their soothsayers, too, and diviners look upon coral as an amu- %0a%3c let endowed with sacred properties, 75 and a sure preservative %0a%3c against all dangers : hence it is that they equally value it as %0a%3c an ornament and as an object of devotion. Before it was %0a%3c known in what estimation coral was held by the people of %0a%3c India, the Gauls were in the habit of adorning their swords, %0a%3c %0a%3c 72 See B. iii. c. 11. %0a%3c %0a%3c 7S Theophrastus reckons coral among the precious stones, and the %0a%3c Pseudo-Orpheus among the minerals. Pliny would seem to be at a loss %0a%3c whether to consider it as an animal or a vegetable. In reality it is the %0a%3c production of marine organized bodies of an arborescent habit, known as %0a%3c Corallina, with jointed stems, supported on a kind of root divided into %0a%3c branches, which are likewise jointed. %0a%3c %0a%3c 14 Because Ktiptirai, it is " cut short" in the 6ea, a far-fetched deriva- %0a%3c tion, apparently. %0a%3c %0a%3c 75 Solinus informs us that Zoroaster attributed certain mysterious pro- %0a%3c perties to coral. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 12 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c pliny's natural history. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XXXII. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c shields, and helmets with it ; but at the present day, owing to %0a%3c the value set upon it as an article of exportation, it has become %0a%3c so extremely rare, that it is seldom to be seen even in the %0a%3c regions that produce it. Branches of coral, hung at the neck %0a%3c of infants, 76 are thought to act as a preservative against danger. %0a%3c Calcined, pulverized, and taken in water, coral gives relief to %0a%3c patients suffering from griping pains in the bowels, affections %0a%3c of the bladder, and urinary calculi. Similarly taken in %0a%3c wine, or, if there are symptoms of fever, in water, it acts as a %0a%3c soporific.

Powdered coral, too, is an excellent remedy for pa- %0a%3c tients who bring up or spit blood. Calcined coral is used as %0a%3c an ingredient in compositions for the eyes, being productive of %0a%3c certain astringent and cooling effects : it makes flesh, also, in %0a%3c the cavities left by ulcers, and effaces scars upon the skin. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 12. — THE ANTIPATHIES AND SYMPATHIES WHICH EXIST %0a%3c BETWEEN CERTAIN OBJECTS.

(3).— AMPHIBIOUS ANIMALS. CASTOBETJM SIXTY-SIX %0a%3c EEMEDIES AND OBSERVATIONS. %0a%3c %0a%3c The might of Nature, too, is equally conspicuous in the %0a%3c animals which live upon dry land as well ; 81 the beaver, for %0a%3c instance, more generally known as " castor," and the testes 82 of %0a%3c which are called in medicine " castorea." Sextius, a most %0a%3c careful enquirer into the nature and history of medicinal sub- %0a%3c stances, assures us that it is not the truth that this animal, %0a%3c when on the point of being taken, bites off its testes : he in- %0a%3c forms us, also, that these substances are small, tightly knit, %0a%3c and attached to the back-bone, and that it is impossible to %0a%3c remove them without taking the animal's life. We learn from %0a%3c him that there is a mode of adulterating them by substituting %0a%3c the kidneys of the beaver, which are of considerable size, %0a%3c whereas the genuine testes are found to be extremely diminu- %0a%3c tive : in addition to which, he says that they must not be taken %0a%3c to be bladders, as they are two in number, a provision not to be %0a%3c found in any animal. Within these pouches, 83 he says, there %0a%3c is a liquid found, which is preserved by being put in salt ; the %0a%3c genuine castoreum being easily known from the false, by the %0a%3c fact of its being contained in two pouches, attached by a single %0a%3c ligament. The genuine article, he says, is sometimes fraudu- %0a%3c lently sophisticated by the admixture of gum and blood, or %0a%3c else hammoniacum : 84 as the pouches, in fact, ought to be of %0a%3c %0a%3c 80 See B. xix. c. 15, and B. xxii. c. 49. %0a%3c %0a%3c 81 As water, and are consequently amphibious. %0a%3c %0a%3c 82 The Castoreum of the ancients, the " castor" of our Materia Medica, %0a%3c is not in reality produced from the testes of the beaver, as was supposed %0a%3c by the ancients, but from two oral pouches situate near the anus of the %0a%3c animal of either sex. There are four of these pouches in all, two con- %0a%3c taining a species of fat, and two larger ones including in their membranous %0a%3c cells a viscous fetid substance, which forms the castor of medicine. It is %0a%3c considered to be an antispasmodic. %0a%3c %0a%3c 8:5 " Folliculos."

Mixed with oil of %0a%3c roses and peucedanum, 85 and applied to the head, it is produc- %0a%3c tive of narcotic effects — a result which is equally produced by %0a%3c taking it in water ; for which reason it is employed in the %0a%3c treatment of phrenitis. Used as a fumigation, it acts as an %0a%3c excitant upon patients suffering from lethargy : and similarly %0a%3c employed, or used in the form of a suppository, it dispels hy- %0a%3c sterical* 6 suffocations. It acts also as an emmenagogue and as %0a%3c an expellent of the afterbirth, being taken by the patient, in %0a%3c doses of two drachmae, with pennyroyal, 87 in water. It is em- %0a%3c ployed also for the cure of vertigo, opisthotony, fits of trem- %0a%3c bling, spasms, affections of the sinews, sciatica, stomachic %0a%3c complaints, and paralysis, the patient either being rubbed with %0a%3c it all over, or else taking it as an electuary, bruised and incor- %0a%3c porated with seed of vitex, 88 vinegar, and oil of roses, to the %0a%3c consistency of honey. In the last form, too, it is taken for the %0a%3c cure of epilepsy, and in a potion, for the purpose of dispelling %0a%3c flatulency and gripings in the bowels, and for counteracting the %0a%3c effects of poison. %0a%3c %0a%3c When taken as a potion, the only difference is in the mode %0a%3c of mixing it, according to the poison that it is intended to %0a%3c neutralize ; thus, for example, when it is taken for the sting %0a%3c of the scorpion, wine is used as the medium ; and when for %0a%3c injuries inflicted by spiders or by the phalangium, 89 honied %0a%3c wine where it is intended to be brought up again, and rue %0a%3c where it is desirable that it should remain upon the stomach. %0a%3c For injuries inflicted by the chalcis, 90 it is taken with myrtle %0a%3c wine ; for the sting of the cerastes 91 or prester 92 with panax 93 or %0a%3c %0a%3c 83 See B. xxv. c. 70. %0a%3c %0a%3c 66 Castor is still given to females to inhale, when suffering from hysteria %0a%3c %0a%3c 87 See B. xx. c. 54. 8b s fce B. xxiv. c. 38. %0a%3c %0a%3c 89 See B. viii. c. 41, B. x. c. 95, and B. xi. cc 24 28 %0a%3c %0a%3c » See B. xxix. c 32 h See B. viii. c. 35,' and B. xvi, c. 80. %0a%3c %0a%3c I," f ee sx - c> L 1 ; B> XXU - C " 13 ; B - xxlii - c - 23 > & xxiv. c. 73. %0a%3c 93 See B. xii. c. 57. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 14.J %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c THE TORTOISE. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 15 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c rue in -wine ; and for those of other serpents, with wine only. %0a%3c In all these cases two drachmas of castoreum is the proper %0a%3c dose, to one of the other ingredients respectively.

The flesh of the land- tortoise is employed for %0a%3c fumigations more particularly, and we find it asserted that it %0a%3c is highly salutary for repelling the malpractices of magic, and for %0a%3c %0a%3c 91 Or Mistletoe ; see B. xvi. c. 92. %0a%3c %0a%3c 95 As to tbe identity of the "nitrum" of the ancients, see B. xxxi. %0a%3c c. 46 and the Notes. %0a%3c %0a%3c 96 See B. xx. c. 76. %0a%3c %0a%3c 97 Under the head of " testudines," he includes the tortoises, terra- %0a%3c penes, and turtles, which form an order of reptiles, known in Natural %0a%3c History as Chelonia, and characterised by the body being enclosed be- %0a%3c tween a double shield or shell, out of which protrude the head, tail, and %0a%3c four extremities. %0a%3c %0a%3c 98 See B. ix. cc. 11, 12. 99 Our tortoises so called. %0a%3c %0a%3c 1 Our Chelonides, or turtles. %0a%3c %0a%3c 2 The Emydes and Trionyches of Modern Natural History. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 16 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c flint's NATURAL HISTOEY.

These tortoises are found in the greatest %0a%3c numbers in Africa ; where the head and feet being first cut off, %0a%3c it is said, they are given to persons by way of antidote. %0a%3c Eaten, too, in a broth made from them, they are thought to %0a%3c disperse scrofula, diminish the volume of the spleen, and effect %0a%3c the cure of epilepsy. The blood of the land-tortoise improves %0a%3c the eyesight, and removes cataract : it is kept also, made up %0a%3c with meal into pills, which are given with wine when neces- %0a%3c sary, to neutralize the poison of all kinds of serpents, frogs, %0a%3c spiders, and similar venomous Animals. It is found a useful %0a%3c plan, too, in cases of glaucoma, to anoint the eyes with gall of %0a%3c tortoises, mixed with Attic honey, and, for the cure of injuries %0a%3c inflicted by scorpions, to drop the gall into the wound. %0a%3c %0a%3c Ashes of tortoiseshell, kneaded up with wine and oil, are %0a%3c used for the cure of chaps upon the feet, and of ulcerations. %0a%3c The shavings of the surface of the shell, administered in drink, %0a%3c act as an antaphrodisiac : a thing that is the more surprising, %0a%3c from the fact that a powder prepared from the whole of the shell %0a%3c has the reputation of being a strong aphrodisiac. As to the urine %0a%3c of the land-tortoise, I do not think that it can be obtained %0a%3c otherwise than by opening it and taking out the bladder ; this %0a%3c being one of those substances to which the adepts in magic %0a%3c attribute such marvellous properties. For the sting of the %0a%3c asp, they say, it is wonderfully effectual ; and even more 60, %0a%3c if bugs are mixed with it. The eggs of the tortoise, hardened %0a%3c by keeping, are applied to scrofulous sores and ulcers arising %0a%3c from burns or cold : they are taken also for pains in the %0a%3c stomach. %0a%3c %0a%3c The flesh of the sea-tortoise, 3 mixed with that of frogs, is %0a%3c an excellent remedy for injuries caused by the salamander; 4 %0a%3c indeed there is nothing that is a better neutralizer of the secre- %0a%3c tions of the salamander than the sea-tortoise. The blood of %0a%3c this animal reproduces the hair when lost through alopecy, %0a%3c and is curative of porrigo and all kinds of ulcerations of the %0a%3c head ; the proper method of using it being to let it dry, and %0a%3c then gently wash it off. For the cure of ear-ache, this blood %0a%3c is injected with woman's milk, and for epilepsy it is eaten %0a%3c with fine wheaten flour, three heminae of the blood being %0a%3c mixed with one hemina of vinegar. It is prescribed also for %0a%3c the cure of asthma ; but in this cas%3ce in combination with one %0a%3c 3 Or turtle. * See B. x. c. 86. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 14.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c THE TORTOISE. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 17 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c hemina of wine. Sometimes, too, it is taken by asthmatic %0a%3c patients, with barley-meal and vinegar, in pieces about the %0a%3c size of a bean ; one of these pieces being taken each morn- %0a%3c ing and evening at first, but after some days, two in the %0a%3c evening. In cases of epilepsy, the mouth of the patient %0a%3c is opened and this blood introduced. For spasmodic affections, %0a%3c when not of a violent nature, it is injected, in combination with %0a%3c castoreum, as a clyster. If a person rinses his teeth three %0a%3c times a year with blood of tortoises, he will be always ex- %0a%3c empt from tooth-ache. This blood is also a cure for asthmatic %0a%3c affections, and for the malady called " orthopnoea," being admi- %0a%3c nistered for these purposes in polenta. %0a%3c %0a%3c The gall of the tortoise improves the eye-sight, effaces scars, %0a%3c and cures affections of the tonsillary glands, quinsy, and all %0a%3c kinds of diseases of the mouth, cancers of that part more par- %0a%3c ticularly, as well as cancer of the testes. Applied to the nos- %0a%3c trils it dispels epilepsy, and sets the patient on his feet : %0a%3c incorporated in vinegar with the slough of a snake, it is a %0a%3c sovereign remedy for purulent discharges from the ears. Some %0a%3c persons add ox-gall and the broth of boiled tortoise-flesh, with %0a%3c an equal proportion of snake's slough ; but in such case, care %0a%3c must be taken to boil the tortoise in wine. Applied with %0a%3c honey, this gall is curative of all diseases of the eyes ; and %0a%3c for the cure of cataract, gall of the sea-tortoise is used, in %0a%3c combination with blood of the river- tortoise and milk. The %0a%3c hair, too, of females, is dyed 5 with this gall. For the cure of %0a%3c injuries inflicted by the salamander, it will be quite sufficient %0a%3c to drink the broth of boiled tortoise-flesh. %0a%3c %0a%3c There is, again, a third 6 kind of tortoise, which inhabits mud %0a%3c and swampy localities : the shell on its back is flat and broad, %0a%3c like that upon the breast, and the callipash is not arched and %0a%3c rounded, the creature being altogether of a repulsive appear- %0a%3c ance. However, there are some remedial medicaments to be %0a%3c derived even from this animal. Thus, for instance, three of %0a%3c them are thrown into a fire made with wood cuttings, and the %0a%3c moment their shells begin to separate they are taken off: the %0a%3c flesh is then removed, and boiled with a little salt, in one con- %0a%3c gius of water. When the water has boiled down to one third, %0a%3c %0a%3c 5 To make it of a vellow or golden colour, Dalechamps says. %0a%3c fi Identified by Ajasson with the Emys lutaria of Modern Natural %0a%3c History. %0a%3c %0a%3c VOL.

The gall, too, is found %0a%3c very useful for carrying off pituitous humours and corrupt %0a%3c blood : taken in cold water, it has an astringent effect upon %0a%3c the bowels. %0a%3c %0a%3c There is a fourth kind of tortoise, which frequents rivers. %0a%3c When used for its remedial properties, the shell of the animal %0a%3c is removed, and the fat separated from the flesh and beaten up %0a%3c with the plant aizoiim, 7 in combination with unguent and lily %0a%3c seed : a preparation highly effectual, it is said, for the cure of %0a%3c quartan fevers, the patient being rubbed with it all over, the %0a%3c head excepted, just before the paroxysms come on, and then %0a%3c well wrapped up and made to drink hot water. It is stated %0a%3c also, that to obtain as much fat as possible, the tortoise should %0a%3c be taken on the fifteenth day of the moon, the patient being %0a%3c anointed on the sixteenth. The blood of this tortoise, dropt, %0a%3c by way of embrocation, upon the region of the brain, allays %0a%3c head-ache ; it is curative also of scrofulous sores. Some per- %0a%3c sons recommend that the tortoise should be laid 8 upon its back %0a%3c and its head cut off with a copper knife, the blood being re- %0a%3c ceived in a new earthen vessel ; and they assure us that the %0a%3c blood of any kind of tortoise, when thus obtained, will be an %0a%3c excellent liniment for the cure of erysipelas, running ulcers %0a%3c upon the head, and warts. Upon the same authority, too, we %0a%3c are assured that the dung of any kind of tortoise is good for %0a%3c the removal of inflammatory tumours. Incredible also as %0a%3c the statement is, we find it asserted by some, that ships 9 make %0a%3c way more slowly when they have the right foot of a tortoise %0a%3c on board. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 15. — REMEDIES DERIVED FROM THE AQUATIC ANIMALS, %0a%3c CLASSIFIED ACCORDING TO THE RESPECTIVE DISEASES. %0a%3c %0a%3c We will now proceed to classify the various remedies de- %0a%3c rived from the aquatic animals, according to the several dis- %0a%3c eases ; not that we are by any means unaware that an expo- %0a%3c sition of all the properties of each animal at once, would be %0a%3c more to the reader's taste, and more likely to excite his admi- %0a%3c %0a%3c 7 Our Houseleek.

Honey, even in a pure state, is sometimes productive of %0a%3c surfeit, and of fits of indigestion, remarkable for their severity ; %0a%3c the best remedy in such case, according to Pelops, is to cut off %0a%3c the feet, head, and tail, of a tortoise, and boil and eat the %0a%3c body ; in place, however, of the tortoise, Apelles mentions %0a%3c the scincus, an animal which has been described elsewhere. 12 %0a%3c "We have already mentioned too, on several occasions, 13 how %0a%3c highly venomous is the menstruous fluid : the surmullet, as %0a%3c already 14 stated, entirely neutralizes its effects.

ELEVEN REMEDIES DERIVED FKOM CYBITJM. %0a%3c %0a%3c Stings inflicted by the sea-dragon 19 or by the sea-scorpion, %0a%3c are cured by an application 20 of the flesh of those animals to %0a%3c the wound ; the bites, too, of spiders are healed by the same %0a%3c means. In fine, as an antidote to every kind of poison, whether %0a%3c taken internally or acting through the agency of a sting or %0a%3c bite, there is considered to be nothing in existence more effec- %0a%3c tual than a decoction of the sea-dragon and sea-scorpion. %0a%3c %0a%3c There are also certain remedies of this nature derived from %0a%3c preserved fish. Persons, for instance, who have received in- %0a%3c juries from serpents, or have been bitten by other venomous %0a%3c animals, are recommended to eat salt fish, and to drink undi- %0a%3c luted wine every now and then, so as, through its agency, to %0a%3c bring up the whole of the food again by vomit : this method %0a%3c being particularly good in cases where injuries have been %0a%3c received from the lizard called " chalcis," 21 the cerastes, 22 %0a%3c the reptile known as the " seps," 23 the elops, 24 or the dipsas. 24 %0a%3c For the sting of the scorpion, salted fish should be taken in %0a%3c larger quantities, but not brought up again, the patient sub- %0a%3c mitting to any amount of thirst it may create : salt fish, too, %0a%3c should be applied, by way of plaster, to the wound. For the %0a%3c bite of the crocodile there is no more efficient remedy known. %0a%3c For the sting of the serpent called " prester," the sarda 26 is %0a%3c particularly good. Salt fish is employed also as a topical appli- %0a%3c cation for the bite of the mad dog ; and even in cases where %0a%3c %0a%3c 19 See Note 16 above. %0a%3c %0a%3c 20 Rondelet asserts, B. vi. c. 19, that he himself had cured the sting of %0a%3c the sea-dragon by an application of the liver of that fish. %0a%3c %0a%3c 21 See B. xxix. c. 32. %0a%3c %0a%3c 22 See B. viii. c. 35, B. xi. c. 43, and B, xvi. c. 80. %0a%3c %0a%3c 23 See B. xxiii. c. 29. %0a%3c %0a%3c 24 Nicander, in his Theriaca, classes the Elops among the innocuous %0a%3c serpents.

For injuries, also, %0a%3c inflicted by the sea-dragon, 27 an application is made of salt %0a%3c fish steeped in vinegar. Cybium, 28 too, is productive of similar %0a%3c effects. As a cure for the venomous sting inflicted with its %0a%3c stickle by the sea-dragon, the fish itself is applied topically %0a%3c to the wound, or else its brain, extracted whole. %0a%3c %0a%3c chap. 18. — the sea-frog: six bemedies. the river-frog : %0a%3c fifty-two eemedies. the bramble-frog : one remedy, %0a%3c thiety-two obseevations on these animals. %0a%3c %0a%3c The broth prepared from sea-frogs, 29 boiled in wine and vine- %0a%3c gar, is taken internally as a neutralizer of poisons and of the %0a%3c venom of the bramble-frog, 30 as also for injuries inflicted by %0a%3c the salamander. 31 For the cure of injuries caused by the sea- %0a%3c hare and the various serpents above mentioned, it is a good %0a%3c plan to eat the flesh of river-frogs, or to drink the liquor in %0a%3c which they have been boiled : as a neutralizer, too, of the %0a%3c venom of the scorpion, river-frogs are taken in wine.

The %0a%3c Greeks call them " phryni :" they are the largest in size of %0a%3c all the frogs, have two protuberances 37 like horns, and are %0a%3c full 38 of poison.

Wine, %0a%3c too, should also be used in all such cases. Iliver-crabs, beaten %0a%3c up with ocimum, 44 and applied to scorpions, are fatal to them. %0a%3c They are possessed of similar virtues, also, for the bites of all %0a%3c other kinds of venomous animals, the scytale 45 in particular, %0a%3c adders, the sea-hare, and the bramble-frog. The ashes of them, %0a%3c preserved, are good for persons who give symptoms of hydro- %0a%3c phobia after being bitten by a mad dog, some adding gentian %0a%3c as well, and administering the mixture in wine. In cases, %0a%3c too, where hydrophobia has already appeared, it is recom- %0a%3c mended that these ashes should be kneaded up into boluses with %0a%3c wine, and swallowed.

Thrasyllus informs us that %0a%3c there is nothing so antagonistic to serpents as crabs; that %0a%3c swine, when stung by a serpent, cure themselves by eatiDg %0a%3c them ; and that, while the sun is in the sign of Cancer, 47 ser- %0a%3c pents suffer the greatest tortures. %0a%3c %0a%3c The flesh, too, of river-snails, eaten either raw or boiled, is %0a%3c an excellent antidote to the venom of the scorpion, some per- %0a%3c sons keeping them salted for the purpose.

But in every country, those oysters are the most %0a%3c highly esteemed that are compact without being slimy from %0a%3c their secretions, and are remarkable more for their thickness %0a%3c than their breadth. They should never be taken in either %0a%3c muddy or sandy spots, but from a firm, hard bottom ; the %0a%3c meat 63 should be compressed, and not of a fleshy consistence; %0a%3c and the oyster should be free from fringed edges, and lying %0a%3c wholly in the cavity of the shell. Persons of experience in %0a%3c these matters add another characteristic ; a fine purple thread, %0a%3c they say, should run round the margins of the beard, this being %0a%3c looked upon as a sign of superior quality, and obtaining for %0a%3c them their name of " calliblephara." 84 %0a%3c %0a%3c Oysters are all the better for travelling and being removed %0a%3c to new waters; thus, for example, the oysters of lirundisium, %0a%3c it is thought, when fed in the waters of Avernus, both retain %0a%3c their own native juices and acquire the flavour of those of %0a%3c %0a%3c 61 See B. ix. c. 74. It is at the spawning season that this milky liquid %0a%3c is found in the oyster ; a period at which the meat of the fish is considered %0a%3c unwholesome as food. We have a saying that the oyster should never be %0a%3c eaten in the months without an r ; that the same, too, was the opinion in %0a%3c the middle ages is proved by the Leonine line : %0a%3c %0a%3c " Mensibus erratis vos ostrea manducatis." %0a%3c •'In the r'd months you may your oysters eat." %0a%3c %0a%3c 62 See B. iii. c. 9.

But in giving this description %0a%3c we will speak in the language of another, using the words of %0a%3c a writer who has evinced more careful discernment in treating %0a%3c of this subject than any of the other authors of our day. %0a%3c These then are the words of Mucianus, in reference to the %0a%3c oyster : — " The oysters of Cyzicus 66 are larger than those of %0a%3c Lake Lucrinus, 66 * fresher 67 than those of the British coasts, 6S %0a%3c sweeter 69 than those of Medulae, 70 more tasty 71 than those of %0a%3c Ephesus, more plump than those of Lucus, 12 less slimy than %0a%3c those of Coryphas, 73 more delicate than those of Istria, 74 and %0a%3c whiter than those of Circeii." 75 For all this, however, it is a %0a%3c fact well ascertained that there are no oysters fresher or more %0a%3c delicate than those of Circeii, last mentioned. %0a%3c %0a%3c According to the historians of the expedition of Alexander, %0a%3c there were oysters found in the Indian Sea a foot 76 in diameter : %0a%3c among ourselves, too, the nomenclature of some spendthrift %0a%3c and gourmand has found for certain oysters the name of " tri- %0a%3c dacna," 77 wishing it to be understood thereby, that they are so %0a%3c large as to require three bites in eating them. "We will %0a%3c take the present opportunity of stating all the medicinal pro- %0a%3c perties that are attributed to oysters. They are singularly %0a%3c refreshing 78 to the stomach, and tend to restore the appetite. %0a%3c Luxury, too, has imparted to them an additional coolness %0a%3c by burying them in snow, thus making a medley of the %0a%3c %0a%3c 66 See B. ix. c. 79. 65 See B. v. c. 40. %0a%3c %0a%3c 66 * See B. iii. c. 9. 67 u Dulciora." %0a%3c %0a%3c 68 Those of Rutupae, the present Ricbborough in Kent, were highly %0a%3c esteemed by the Romans.

Applied %0a%3c with water, these ashes are good for ulcerations of the head, %0a%3c and impart a plumpness to the skin in females. They are %0a%3c sprinkled, too, upon burns, and are highly esteemed as a den- %0a%3c tifrice. Applied with vinegar, they are good for the removal %0a%3c of prurigo and of pituitous eruptions.

The most esteemed kind of %0a%3c all is that which grows off the shores of Crete, upon the rocks %0a%3c there, close to the ground : it being used also for dyeing wool, %0a%3c as it has the property 83 of so fixing the colours as never to %0a%3c allow of their being washed out.

Powdered bone %0a%3c of saepia is used also for the treatment of nyctalopy, being %0a%3c applied to the eyes with vinegar. Reduced to ashes, this %0a%3c substance removes scales upon the eyes : applied with honey, %0a%3c it effaces marks upon those organs : and used with salt and %0a%3c cadmia, 3 one drachma of each, it disperses webs which im- %0a%3c pede the eyesight, as also albugo in the eyes of cattle.

That of Pontus 6 is highly esteemed : %0a%3c it is white, free from veins or scales, and dissolves with the %0a%3c greatest rapidity. The proper way of using it, is to cut it %0a%3c into small pieces, and then to leave it to soak in water or %0a%3c vinegar a night and a day, after which it should be pounded %0a%3c %0a%3c 2 Cortex. 3 See B. xxxiv. cc. 22, 23. 4 " Ossiculo." %0a%3c %0a%3c 5 Literally, " fish-glue."

It is most probable, however, that %0a%3c the "ichthyocolla" of the ancients, or "fish-glue," was the same as our %0a%3c isinglass, and that it was prepared from the entrails of various fish, the %0a%3c ■tnrgeon more particularly, the Acipenser huso of Linnaeus. %0a%3c %0a%3c 6 The best isinglass still comes from Russia. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 32 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c PLINY'S JfATUBAL 1IIST0BT. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XXXII. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c with sea-shore pebbles, to make it melt the more easily.

The slimy moisture on this reptile's body, scraped off with %0a%3c a spatula and applied to the eyes, greatly improves the sight, %0a%3c they say : the flesh, too, is employed as a topical application %0a%3c for the removal of pains in the eyes. %0a%3c %0a%3c Some persons take fifteen frogs, and after spitting them %0a%3c upon as many bulrushes, put them into a new earthen vessel : %0a%3c they then mix the juices which flow from them, with gum of %0a%3c the white vine, 9 and use it as an application for the eye-lids ; %0a%3c first pulling out such eye-lashes as are in the way, and then %0a%3c dropping the preparation with the point of a needle into the %0a%3c places from which the hairs have been removed.

REMEDIES FOR TOOTH-ACnE. THE DOG-FISH : FOUR %0a%3c %0a%3c REMEDIES. WHALE'S FLESH. %0a%3c %0a%3c Tooth-ache is alleviated by scarifying the gums with bones %0a%3c of the sea-dragon, or by rubbing the teeth once a year with %0a%3c the brains of a dog-fish 21 boiled in oil, and kept for the purpose. %0a%3c It is a very good plan too, for the cure of tooth-ache, to lance %0a%3c the gums with the sting of the pastinaca" in some cases. %0a%3c This sting, too, is pounded, and applied to the teeth with white %0a%3c hellebore, having the effect of extracting them without the %0a%3c slightest difficulty. Another of these remedies is, ashes of %0a%3c salted fish calcined in an earthen vessel, mixed with powdered %0a%3c marble. Stale cybium, 23 rinsed in a new earthen vessel, and %0a%3c then pounded, is very useful for the cure of tooth-ache. %0a%3c Equally good, it is said, are the back-bones of all kinds of salt %0a%3c fish, pounded and applied in a liniment. A decoction is made of %0a%3c a single frog boiled in one hemina of vinegar, and the teeth %0a%3c are rinsed with it, the decoction being retained in the mouth. %0a%3c In cases where a repugnance existed to making use of this %0a%3c remedy, Sallustius Dionysius 24 used to suspend frogs over %0a%3c boiling vinegar by the hind legs, so as to make them discharge %0a%3c their humours into the vinegar by the mouth, using consider- %0a%3c able numbers of frogs for the purpose : to those, however, who %0a%3c had a stronger stomach, he prescribed the frogs themselves, %0a%3c eaten with their broth. It is generally thought, too, that %0a%3c this recipe applies more particularly to the double teeth, and %0a%3c that the vinegar prepared as above-mentioned, is remarkably %0a%3c useful for strengthening them when loose. %0a%3c %0a%3c For this last purpose, some persons cut off the legs of two %0a%3c frogs, and then macerate the bodies in two hemina) of wine, %0a%3c recommending this preparation as a collutory for strengthening %0a%3c loose teeth. Others attach the frogs, whole, to the exterior of %0a%3c the jaws i 25 and with some it is the practice to boil ten frogs, %0a%3c %0a%3c 20 See Note 89 to Chapter 23 of this Book. %0a%3c %0a%3c 21 "Canicula."

By certain autho- %0a%3c rities, too, it has been recommended to boil the hearts of six- %0a%3c and-thirty frogs beneath a copper vessel, in one sextarius of old %0a%3c oil, and then to inject the decoction into the ear on the same %0a%3c side of the jaw as the part affected : while others again have %0a%3c used, as an application for the teeth, a frog's liver, boiled, and %0a%3c beaten up with honey. All the preparations above described %0a%3c will be found still more efficacious if made from the sea- %0a%3c frog. 25 In cases where the teeth are carious and emit an %0a%3c offensive smell, it is recommended to dry some whale's 27 flesh %0a%3c in an oven for a night, and then to add an equal quantity of %0a%3c salt, and use the mixture as a dentifrice. " Enhydris" 28 is the %0a%3c name given by the Greeks to a snake that lives in the water. %0a%3c With the four upper teeth of this reptile, it is the practice, for %0a%3c the cure of aching in the upper teeth, to lance the upper gums, %0a%3c and with the four lower teeth, for aching in the lower. Some %0a%3c persons, however, content themselves with using an eyetooth %0a%3c only. Ashes, too, of burnt crabs are used for this purpose; %0a%3c and the murex, reduced to ashes, makes an excellent den- %0a%3c tifrice. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 27. — REMEDIES FOE.

The proper way of cooking them is with %0a%3c dill, parsley, coriander, and leeks, with the addition of oil and %0a%3c salt. Stale cybium, 66 too, acts as a purgative, and is particularly %0a%3c useful for carrying on 0 crudities, pituitous humours, and bile. %0a%3c %0a%3c The myax 57 is of a purgative nature, a shell-fish of which %0a%3c we shall take this opportunity of giving the natural his- %0a%3c tory at length. These fish collect together in masses, like the %0a%3c iuurex, 58 and are found in spots covered with sea-weed. They %0a%3c are the finest eating in autumn, and are found in the greatest %0a%3c perfection in places where fresh-water streams discharge them- %0a%3c selves into the sea ; for which reason it is that those of Egypt %0a%3c are held in such high esteem. As the winter advances, they %0a%3c contract a bitter flavour, and assume a reddish hue. The %0a%3c liquor of these fish, it is said, acts as a purgative upon the %0a%3c bowels and bladder, has a detergent effect upon the intestines, %0a%3c acts aperiently upon all the passages, purges the kidneys, and %0a%3c diminishes the blood and adipose secretions. Hence it is that %0a%3c these shell-fish are found of the greatest use for the treatment %0a%3c of dropsy, for the regulation of the catamenia, and for the re- %0a%3c moval of jaundice, all diseases of the joints, and flatulency. %0a%3c They are very good, also, for the reduction of obesity, for %0a%3c diseases of the bile and of the pituitous secretions, for affec- %0a%3c tions of the lungs, liver, and spleen, and for rheumatic de- %0a%3c fluxions. The only inconvenience resulting from them is, that %0a%3c they irritate the throat and impede the articulation. They %0a%3c have, also, a healing effect upon ulcers of a serpiginous nature, %0a%3c or which stand in need of detergents, as also upon carcinoma- %0a%3c tous sores. Calcined, the same way as the murex, and em- %0a%3c ployed with honey, they are curative of bites inflicted either %0a%3c by dogs or human beings, and of leprous spots or freckles. The %0a%3c ashes of them, rinsed, are good for the removal of films upon %0a%3c the eyes, granulations of those organs and indurations of the %0a%3c membrane, as also for diseases of the gums and teeth, and for %0a%3c pituitous eruptions. They serve, also, as an antidote to doryc- %0a%3c nium 59 and to opocarpathon. 60 %0a%3c %0a%3c 56 Sliced tunny.

The %0a%3c ashes, also, of the mitulus, like those of the murex, are pos- %0a%3c sessed of certain caustic properties, and are very useful for the %0a%3c removal of leprous spots, freckles, and blemishes of the skin. %0a%3c They are rinsed, too, in the same manner as lead, 63 for the %0a%3c removal of swellings of the eyelids, of indurations of the %0a%3c membranes, and of films upon the eyes, as also of sordid ulcers %0a%3c upon other parts of the body, and of pustules upon the head. %0a%3c The meat of them, also, is employed as an application for bites %0a%3c inflicted by dogs. %0a%3c %0a%3c As to pelorides, 64 they act as a gentle laxative upon the %0a%3c bowels, an effect equally produced by castoreum, taken in doses %0a%3c of two drachmae, in hydromel : where, however, a more drastic %0a%3c purgative is recpiired, one drachma of dried garden-cucumber %0a%3c root is added, and two drachmae of aphronitrum. 69 The %0a%3c tethea 66 is good for griping pains in the bowels and for attacks %0a%3c of flatulency : they are generally found adhering to the leaves %0a%3c of marine plants, sucking their nutriment therefrom, and may %0a%3c be rather looked upon as a sort of fungus than as a fish. They %0a%3c are useful, also, for the removal of tenesmus and of diseases of %0a%3c the kidneys. %0a%3c %0a%3c There grows also in the sea a kind of absinthium, known by %0a%3c some persons as " seriphum," 67 and found in the vicinity of %0a%3c Taposiris, 68 in Egypt, more particularly. It is of a more %0a%3c slender form than the land absinthium, acts as a purgative %0a%3c upon the bowels, and effectually removes intestinal worms. %0a%3c The ssepia, too, is a laxative ; for which purpose these fish are %0a%3c %0a%3c 61 Identical with our mussel, probably. %0a%3c %0a%3c 62 Holland identifies this with the cockle, but it is probably a smaller %0a%3c kind of mussel. 63 See B. xxxiv. c. 50. %0a%3c %0a%3c 61 We learn from Chapter 53 of this Book, that one class of the %0a%3c "Cbamae," or gaping cockles, was known as "Pelorides."

The sea-scorpion," %0a%3c too, is used for the same purpose, boiled in wine, and applied %0a%3c as a fomentation to the part affected. Shells of sea-urchins, %0a%3c bruised and applied with water, act as a check upon incipient %0a%3c inflammatory tumours. Ashes of the murex, or of the purple, %0a%3c are employed in either case, whether it is wanted to disperse %0a%3c inflammatory tumours in an incipient state, or to bring them %0a%3c to a head and break them. Some authorities prescribe the fol- %0a%3c lowing preparation : of wax and frankincense twenty drachma?, %0a%3c of litharge forty drachmae, of calcined murex ten drachmae, %0a%3c and of old oil, one semisextarius. Salt fish, boiled and ap- %0a%3c plied by itself, is highly useful for the above purposes. %0a%3c %0a%3c River crabs, bruised and applied, disperse pustules on the %0a%3c generative organs : the same, too, with calcined heads of %0a%3c maenae, 1 or the flesh of that fish, boiled and applied.

For a similar purpose the fishes called " smarides" 6 %0a%3c are applied topically ; as also ashes of the shell of the murex %0a%3c or of the purple, applied with honey ; which last are still more %0a%3c efficacious when the flesh has been burnt with the shell. %0a%3c %0a%3c Salt fish, boiled with honey, is particularly good for the %0a%3c cure of carbuncles upon the generative organs.

For cachectic patients, where %0a%3c the body is wasting with consumption, tethese 37 are considered %0a%3c beneficial, mixed with rue and honey. For the cure of %0a%3c dropsy, dolphin's fat is melted and taken with wine, the re- %0a%3c pulsive taste of it being neutralized by first touching the %0a%3c nostrils with unguent or some other odoriferous substance, or %0a%3c else by plugging the nostrils in some way or other. The flesh %0a%3c of strombi, pounded and given in three heminse of honied %0a%3c wine and the same quantity of water, or, if there is fever, %0a%3c in hydromel, is very useful for dropsy: the same, too, with %0a%3c the juice of river-crabs, administered with honey.

THE POLYP : ONE REMEDY. %0a%3c %0a%3c Fish, used as. an aliment, it is generally thought, make %0a%3c blood. The polyp, 44 bruised and applied, arrests haemorrhage, %0a%3c it is thought: in addition to which we find stated the follow- %0a%3c ing particulars respecting it — that of itself it emits a sort of %0a%3c brine, in consequence of which, there is no necessity to use %0a%3c any in cooking it — that it should always be sliced with a reed %0a%3c — "and that it is spoilt by using an iron knife, becoming tainted %0a%3c thereby, owing to the antipathy 45 which naturally exists %0a%3c [between it and iron]. For the purpose also of arresting %0a%3c heemorrhage, ashes of burnt frogs are applied topically, or else %0a%3c the dried blood of those animals. Some authorities recom- %0a%3c mend the frog to be used, that is known by the Greeks as %0a%3c " calamites," 46 from the fact that it lives among reeds 47 and %0a%3c shrubs ; it is the smallest and greenest of all the frogs, and %0a%3c either the blood or the ashes of it are recommended to be em- %0a%3c ployed. Others, again, prescribe, in cases of bleeding at the %0a%3c nostrils, an injection of the ashes of young water-frogs, in the %0a%3c tadpole state, calcined in a new earthen vessel. %0a%3c %0a%3c io Or sting-ray.

Still, however, there is this inconvenience attend- %0a%3c ing them — when they have been once applied, they create a %0a%3c necessity 60 for having recourse to the same treatment at about %0a%3c the same period in every succeeding year. Many physicians %0a%3c have been of opinion also, that leeches may be successfully ap- %0a%3c plied in cases of gout. When gorged, they fall off in conse- %0a%3c quence of losing their hold through the weight of the blood, %0a%3c but if not, they must be sprinkled with salt 81 for the purpose. %0a%3c %0a%3c Leeches are apt, however, to leave their heads buried in the %0a%3c flesh ; the consequence of which is an incurable wound, which %0a%3c has caused death in many cases, that of Messalinus, 52 for ex- %0a%3c ample, a patrician of consular rank, after an application of %0a%3c leeches to his knee. When this is the case, that which was %0a%3c intended as a remedy is turned into an active poison ; 53 a result %0a%3c which is to be apprehended in using the red leeches more %0a%3c particularly. Hence it is that when these last are employed, %0a%3c it is the practice to snip them with a pair of scissors while %0a%3c sucking ; the consequence of which is, that the blood oozes %0a%3c forth, through a siphon, as it were, and the head, gradually %0a%3c contracting as the animal dies, is not left behind in the wound. %0a%3c There is a natural antipathy 54 existing between leeches and %0a%3c bugs, and hence it is that the latter are killed by the aid %0a%3c of a fumigation made with leeches. Ashes of beaver-skin %0a%3c burnt with tar, kneaded up with leek-juice, arrest bleeding at %0a%3c the nostrils. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 43. — METHODS OF EXTRACTING FOREIGN BODIES FROM %0a%3c THE FLESH. %0a%3c %0a%3c To extract pointed weapons which have pierced the flesh, %0a%3c ashes of calcined shells of the ssepia are used, as also of the %0a%3c %0a%3c 48 "Bloodsuckers." *» " Cucurbitae medicinales." %0a%3c %0a%3c 511 This does not appear to he considered the case at the present day. %0a%3c Sl A method still employed. 52 See B.

Ashes of sea-crabs, cal- %0a%3c cined with lead, arrest the progress of carcinomatous sores ; a %0a%3c purpose for which ashes of river-crabs, in combination with %0a%3c honey and fine lint, are equally useful : though there are some %0a%3c authorities which prefer mixing alum and barley with the %0a%3c ashes. Phagedenic ulcers are cured by an application of %0a%3c dried silurus pounded with sandarach ; 61 malignant cancers, %0a%3c corrosive ulcers, and putrid 6ores, by the agency of stale %0a%3c cybium. 62 %0a%3c %0a%3c Maggots that breed in sores are removed by applying frogs' %0a%3c gall; and fistulas are opened and dried by introducing a tent %0a%3c made of salt fish, with a dossil of lint.

Crabs, too, either fresh or dried, %0a%3c are taken in drink, for the purpose of preventing abortion. %0a%3c Hippocrates 85 prescribes them as a promoter of menstruation, %0a%3c and as an expellent of the dead foetus, beaten up with five 88 %0a%3c roots of lapathum and rue and some soot, and administered %0a%3c in honied wine.

If, however, a female in a state of pregnancy %0a%3c should happen to step over castoreum, or over the beaver itself, %0a%3c abortion, it is said, will be the sure result : so, too, if casto- %0a%3c reum is only held over a pregnant woman's head, there will be %0a%3c great danger of miscarriage. %0a%3c %0a%3c There is a very marvellous fact, too, that I find stated in %0a%3c reference to the torpedo : 90 if it is caught at the time that the %0a%3c moon is in Libra, and kept in the open air for three days, it %0a%3c will always facilitate parturition, as often as it is introduced %0a%3c into the apartment of a woman in labour. The sting, too, of %0a%3c the pastinaca, 91 attached to the navel, is generally thought to %0a%3c have the property of facilitating delivery : it must be taken, %0a%3c however, from the fish while alive ; which done, the fish must %0a%3c be returned to the sea. I find it stated by some authorities that %0a%3c there is a substance called " ostraceum," which is also spoken %0a%3c of as " onyx " 92 by others ; that, used as a fumigation, it is %0a%3c wonderfully beneficial for suffocations of the uterus ; that in %0a%3c smell it resembles castoreum, and is still more efficacious, if %0a%3c burnt with this last substance ; and that in a calcined state it %0a%3c has the property of healing inveterate ulcers, and cancerous %0a%3c sores of a malignant nature. As to carbuncles and carcino- %0a%3c matous sores upon the secret parts of females, there is nothing %0a%3c more efficacious, it is said, than a female crab beaten up, just %0a%3c after full moon, with flower of salt 95 and applied with water. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 47. — METHODS OF REMOVING SUPERFLUOUS HAIR. %0a%3c %0a%3c DEPILATORIES. • %0a%3c %0a%3c Depilatories are prepared from the blood, gall, and liver of the %0a%3c tunny, either fresh or preserved ; as also from pounded liver of %0a%3c the same fish, preserved with cedar resin 94 in a leaden box; a re- %0a%3c %0a%3c 89 See B. xii. c. 57 . 90 See B. ix. cc. 24, 48, 74, 75. %0a%3c %0a%3c •J Or sting-ray.

THE %0a%3c INK OF THE S^PIA.* %0a%3c %0a%3c Among the aquatic productions ought also to be mentioned %0a%3c calamochnos, in Latin known as " adarea," 19 a substance which %0a%3c collects about small reeds, from a mixture of the foam of fresh %0a%3c and of sea water. It possesses certain caustic properties, and %0a%3c hence it is that it is so useful as an ingredient in " acopa" 20 %0a%3c and as a remedy for cold shiverings ; it is used too, for remov- %0a%3c ing freckles upon the face of females. And now we are %0a%3c speaking of adarca, the reed ought equally to be mentioned. The %0a%3c root of that known as the " phragmites," 21 pounded fresh, is %0a%3c curative of sprains, and, applied topically with vinegar, re- %0a%3c moves pains in the spine. The calcined bark, too, of the %0a%3c Cyprian 22 reed, known as the " donax," is curative of alopecy %0a%3c and inveterate ulcers ; and its leaves are good for the extrac- %0a%3c tion of foreign bodies adhering to the flesh, and for the cure %0a%3c of erysipelas : should, however, the flower of the panicle happen %0a%3c to enter the ears, deafness 23 is the consequence. %0a%3c %0a%3c The ink of the ssepia 24 is possessed of such remarkable po- %0a%3c tency, that if it is put into a lamp, Anaxilaus tells us, the light %0a%3c will become entirely changed, 25 and all present will look %0a%3c as black as ^Ethiopians.

These animals, it is generally considered, %0a%3c embrace one hundred and seventy-six different 28 species, and it %0a%3c will be my object to set them forth, each by its distinct name, %0a%3c a thing that caunot possibly be done in reference to the terres- %0a%3c trial animals and the birds. %0a%3c %0a%3c For, in fact, we are by no means acquainted with all the %0a%3c wild beasts or all the birds that are to be found in India, iEthi- %0a%3c opia, Scythia, or the desert regions of the earth ; and even of %0a%3c man himself there are numerous varieties, which as yet we %0a%3c have been unable 29 to make ourselves acquainted with. In ad- %0a%3c dition, too, to the various countries above mentioned, we have %0a%3c Taprobane 30 and other isles of the Ocean, about which so many %0a%3c fabulous stories are related. Surely then, every one must allow %0a%3c that it is quite impossible to comprise every species of animal in %0a%3c one general view for the information of mankind. And yet, by %0a%3c Hercules ! in the sea and in the Ocean, vast as it is, there exists %0a%3c nothing that is unknown to us, 31 and, a truly marvellous fact, %0a%3c it is with those things which Nature has concealed in the deep %0a%3c that we are the best acquainted ! %0a%3c %0a%3c To begin then with the monsters 32 that are found in this ele- %0a%3c %0a%3c 27 This seems to be the meaning of "adeo ut baculura ita prfeluceat." %0a%3c %0a%3c 28 Some MSS. have here " 164," the Bamberg MS. and others " 144." %0a%3c Owing to the corrupt state of the text in many parts of this Chapter, it is %0a%3c impossible to say which reading is correct. %0a%3c %0a%3c 29 " Invenire noa potuimus " seems a preferable reading to " invenire %0a%3c potuimus." %0a%3c %0a%3c 3° Modern Ceylon.

The helops, he %0a%3c says, is unknown to our waters ; from which it would appear %0a%3c that those are in error who look upon it as identical with our %0a%3c acipenser. 26 Many persons have given the preference to the %0a%3c helops before all other. fish, in point of flavour. %0a%3c %0a%3c There are several fishes also, which have been mentioned by %0a%3c no author; such, for instance, as the one called "sudis" by %0a%3c the Latins, and "sphyrene" by the Greeks, names which in- %0a%3c dicate the peculiar form of its muzzle. 27 It is one of the very %0a%3c largest kinds, but rarely found, and by no means of inferior %0a%3c flavour. " Perna," too, is the name given to a kind of shell- %0a%3c fish, found in vast numbers in the vicinity of the islands of the %0a%3c Euxine. These fish are found firmly planted in the sand, re- %0a%3c sembling in appearance the long shank 28 of a hog. Opening %0a%3c wide their shells, where there is sufficient space, they lie in %0a%3c wait for their prey ; this opening being not less than a foot in %0a%3c breadth, and the edges of it garnished around with teeth %0a%3c closely set, much resembling the teeth of a comb in form. %0a%3c Within the shell, the meat consists of a vast lump of flesh. %0a%3c I once saw, too, a fish called the " hyaena," 29 which had been %0a%3c caught off the island of JEnaria. 30 %0a%3c %0a%3c In addition to these animals, there are certain excretions %0a%3c thrown up by the sea, which do not merit any further notice, %0a%3c and indeed ought to be reckoned among the sea-weeds, rather %0a%3c than looked upon as animated beings. %0a%3c %0a%3c Summary. — Remedies, narratives, and observations, nine %0a%3c hundred and ninety. %0a%3c %0a%3c Roman Authors quoted. — Licinius Macer, 31 Trebius Niger, 32 %0a%3c %0a%3c 23 See B. ix. c. 25. 2 * See B. ix. c. 47 %0a%3c %0a%3c 25 See B. ix. c. 42. %0a%3c %0a%3c 56 See B. ix. c. 27.
