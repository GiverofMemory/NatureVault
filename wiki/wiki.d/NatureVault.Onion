text=(:nogroupheader:)%0aThis is the #2 [[survival food]] to grow after [[lambs quarters]].  One aspect that is better than [[lambs quarters]] is; it is more easily storable during winter.  You could survive on cooked onions for a long time.  In a survival situation, like most of our survival crops, I suggest eating it as a [[soup]].  Onion is grown in 175 countries, which is more than any other crop in the world. [[https://www.kickassfacts.com/onion-facts/|#]] Arguably onion were also the first crop ever cultivated, both in ancient history 5500 BC and also in American history [[http://www.vegetablefacts.net/vegetable-history/history-of-onions/|#]].%0a%0aThey do contain a bit of protien; and a good source of carbs and sugars, no fat to speak of. They contain [[sulfur]] which I believe is an underappreciated nutrient and might help prevent muscle wasting on a low protien diet since most protiens like collagen and keratin contain sulfur [[https://supplementpolice.com/sulfur-supplements/|#]].  Sulfur is also necessary to produce insulin to maintain healthy blood sugar [[https://www.britannica.com/science/insulin|#]]. They also contain lots of fiber [[https://mobile.fatsecret.com/calories-nutrition/usda/onions|#]] which keeps the gut healthy, which is the most critical thing to survive. %0a%0a!!Cultivation%0aHere is info on cultivation [[https://agrifarmingtips.com/onion-farming/|#]]. Onion is also very resistant to pests and diseases and can grow in almost any soil type [[https://www.shtfblog.com/survival-food-onions/|#]].  The only downside is you only get about 5,000,000 calories per acre [[https://www.agrifarming.in/onion-cultivation-income-project-report-yield-profits|#]] which is about half of rice or 1/3 of [[corn]], but still enough to feed 5 people per acre of plant.[[https://www.thefarmersdaughterusa.com/average-calories-per-acre/|#]] Potatoes and corn are pretty on par with eachother [[https://www.mathscinotes.com/2017/01/calorie-per-acre-improvements-in-staple-crops-over-time/|#]].  One very important aspect of onion as a survival food is that it is easy to grow either from seed or from propogating the bulbs which is the best of both worlds. [[https://properlyrooted.com/onions-from-bulbs/|#]]%0a!!Varieties%0aYellow, red, and white onions are the most common types.  Yellow and red contain quercetin, red also contains anthocyanin.[[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229935504_The_Pigments_in_Three_Cultivars_of_the_Common_Onion_Allium_cepa|#]]%0a!!!Yellow onions[[#yellow]]%0aA good keeping and producing yellow onion is the southport yellow globe [[https://www.motherearthnews.com/organic-gardening/heirloom-onion-varieties-zewz1308zpit|#]] and can be purchased [[https://www.oscseeds.com/product/early-yellow-globe-onion-market-type-1820/|here]].%0a!!Medicine[[#med]]%0aOnions were used as a performance enhancing drug in the Olympic games in ancient Greece [[https://www.onions-usa.org/all-about-onions/history-of-onions/|#]].
