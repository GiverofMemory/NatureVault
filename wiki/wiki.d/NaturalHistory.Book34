THE OEES OF BRASS. 1 %0a%0aWe must, in the next place, give an account of the ores of %0abrass, 2 a metal which, in respect of utility, is next in value ; %0aindeed the Corinthian brass comes before silver, not to say %0aalmost before gold itself. It is also, as I have stated above, 3 %0athe standard of monetary value ; 4 hence the terms " sera mili- %0atum," " tribuni aerarii," " aerarium," " obaerati," and " aere %0adiruti." 5 I have already mentioned for what length of time %0athe Roman people employed no coin except brass ; 6 and there is %0a%0a1 The present Book is translated by the late Dr. Bostock, the translation %0abeing corrected by the readings of the Bamberg MS., which do not appear %0ato have come under his notice. Some Notes by Dr. Bostock will be also %0afound at the commencement of Books 33 and 35 ; they are distinguished %0aby the initial B. %0a%0a• " JSris Metalla." The word " iEs " does not entirely correspond to %0aour word " brass •," the brass of the moderns being a compound of copper %0aand zinc, while the "iEs" of the ancients was mostly composed of copper %0aand tin, and therefore, would be more correctly designated by the word %0a" bronze." But this last term is now so generally appropriated to works of %0aart, that it would seem preferable to employ in most cases the more general %0aterms " copper" or " brass." For an excellent account of the " iEs" of the %0aancients, see Smith's Diet. Antiq. "iEs."— B. Mr. "Westmacott, in the %0aabove-mentioned article, says that the ancient "iEs" has been found, %0aupon analysis, to contain no zinc, but in nearly every instance to be a mix- %0ature of copper and tin, like our bronze. Beckmann says, on the other %0ahand, that the mixture of zinc and copper now called "brass," first dis- %0acovered by ores, abundant in zinc, was certainly known to the ancients. %0a"In the course of time, an ore, which mast have been calamine, was added %0ato copper while melting, to give it a yellow colour." Hist. Inv. Vol. II. %0app. 32, 33. Bohn's Edition. There can be little doubt that the native %0aCadmia of Chapter 22 of this Book was our Calamine, hydrosilicate of %0azinc, or carbonate of zinc, or else copper ore impregnated with calamine. %0a%0a3 In B. xxxiii. c. 13. %0a%0a4 " Stipis auctoritas."

The metal is also %0aobtained from a coppery stone called "cadmia." 9 The most %0ahighly esteemed copper is procured from beyond seas : it was %0aformerly obtained in Campania also, and at present is found in %0athe country of the Bergomates, 10 at the extremity of Italy. %0aIt is said to have been lately discovered also in the province of %0aGermany. %0a%0a(2.) In Cyprus, where copper was first discovered, it is also pro- %0acured from another stone, which is called " chalcitis." 11 This, %0ahowever, was afterwards considered of little value, a better %0akind having been found in other regions, especially that called %0a"aurichalcum," 12 which was long in high request, onaccouutof %0a%0aI " Collegium." The colleges of the priests and of the augur3 being %0athe first two associated bodies. — E. %0a%0a8 In B. xxxiii. c. 31, where we have an account of the ores of silver. — B. %0a%0a9 Pliny again refers to this mineral in the 22d Chapter. We have no %0ameans of ascertaining, with certainty, what is the substance to which this %0aname was applied by the ancients. The ores of copper are very nume- %0arous, and of various chemical constitutions: the most abundant, and those %0amost commonly employed in the production of the pure metal, are the %0asulphurets. more especially what is termed copper pyrites, and the oxides. %0aIt has been supposed, by some commentators, that the Cadmia of the an- %0acients was Calamine, which is an ore of zinc ; but we may be confident %0athat the j£s of the ancients could not be produced from this substance, %0abecause, as has been stated above, the JEs contains no zinc. I must, how- %0aever, observe that the contrary opinion is maintained by M. Delafosse. — B. %0aSee Note 2 above. %0a%0a10 The inhabitants of Bergamum, the modern Bergamo.— B. See B. iii. %0ac. 21. %0a%0aII Aristotle gives the same account of the copper ore of Cyprus. Chal- %0acitis is also spoken of by Dioscorides, as an ore of copper. — B. See further %0aas to " Chalcitis," in Chapter 29 of this Book. %0a%0a12 There has been much discussion respecting the nature of this sub- %0astance, and the derivation of the word. Hardouin conceives it probable %0athat it was originally written " orichalcuni," i.e. "mountain brass" or %0a" copper."— B. Ajasson considers it to be native brass, a mixture of copper %0aand zinc. In the later writers it signifies artificial brass. The exact com- %0aposition of this metal is still unknown, but there is little doubt that Har- %0adouin is right in his supposition as to the origin of the name. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 3.] %0a%0a%0a%0aTHE CORINTHIAN BRASS. %0a%0a%0a%0a149 %0a%0a%0a%0aits excellent quality ; but none of it has been found for this %0along time, the earth having been quite exhausted. The kind %0awhich was next in value was the Sallustian, 13 procured from %0athe Alpine district of the Centrones ; u but this did not last %0along, and was succeeded by the Livian, in Gaul. They both %0atook their names from the owners of the mines ; the former a %0afriend of the Emperor Augustus, the latter that emperor's %0awife. 10 They soon failed, however, and in the Livian even %0athere is now found but a very small quantity of ore. That %0awhich is at present held in the highest estimation is the %0aMarian, likewise known as the Corduban : 16 next to the Livian, %0athis kind most readily absorbs cadmia, and becomes almost as %0aexcellent as aurichalcum 17 for making sesterces and double %0aasses, 18 the Cyprian copper being thought good enough for the %0aas. Thus much concerning the natural qualities of this metal. %0a%0aCHAP 3. THE CORINTHIAN BRASS. %0a%0aThe other kinds are made artificially, all of which will be %0adescribed in the appropriate places, the more celebrated kinds %0afirst coming under our notice. Formerly a mixture was made %0aof copper fused with gold and silver, and the workmanship in %0athis metal was considered even more valuable than the ma- %0aterial itself; but, at the present day, it is difficult to say %0awhether the workmanship in it, or the material, is the worst. %0aIndeed, it is wonderful, that while the value of these works' 9 %0a%0a13 Possibly so called from Sallustius Crispus, the historian, who was one %0aof the secretaries of Augustus. %0a%0au There is some doubt respecting the locality of these people ; they are %0aenumerated hy Pliny among the inhabitants of the mountainous districts of %0aSavoy, B. iii. c. 24, and are referred to by Ptolemy.— B. %0a%0a15 Livia. %0a%0a'-- It was named " Marian," after the celebrated Marius, and " Cordu- %0aban," from the place whence it was procured ; probably the mountains near %0aCoiduba, in Spain, well known as the birth-place of the two Senecas and %0aof Lucan. — B. See B. iii. c. 3, and B. xix. c. 43. %0a%0a17 No light is thrown upon the nature either of Cadmia or Aurichalcum %0abv this starument; we only learn from it that different compounds, or sub- %0astances possessing different physical properties, went under the common %0aappellation of JSa, and were, each of them, employed in the formation of %0acoins. — B. , , . . „ %0a%0a18 "Dupondiariis."

See B. xxxiii. c. 13, and the Introduction to Vol. III. %0a%0a» lie alludes to the ancient works of art in this compound metal. %0a%0a%0a%0a150 %0a%0a%0a%0aplint's NATURAL HISTORY. [Book XXXIV. %0a%0a%0a%0ahas so infinitely increased, the reputation of the art itself 20 is %0anearly extinct. But it would appear, that in this, as in every- %0athing else, what was formerly done for the sake of reputation, %0ais now undertaken for the mere purpose of gain. For %0awhereas this art was ascribed to the gods 21 themselves, and %0amen of rank in all countries endeavoured to acquire fame by %0athe practice of it, we have now so entirely lost the method of %0amaking this valuable compound by fusion, that, for this long %0atime past, not even chance itself has assumed, in this depart- %0ament, the privilege which formerly belonged to art. 22 %0a%0aXext after the above compound, so celebrated in antiquity, %0athe Corinthian metal has been the most highly esteemed. This %0awas a compound produced by accident, when Corinth was burnt %0aat the time of its capture. 23 There has been a wonderful mania %0awith many for gaining possession of this metal. It is even said, %0athat Yerres, whom M. Cicero caused to be condemned, was %0aproscribed by Antonius, along with Cicero, for no other reason %0athan his refusal to give up some specimens of Corinthian metal, %0awhich were in his possession. But most of these people seem %0ato me to make a pretence of their discernment in reference to %0athis metal, rather for the purpose of distinguishing themselves %0afrom the multitude, than from any real knowledge which they %0apossess ; and this I will briefly show. %0a%0aCorinth was captured in the third year of the 158th %0aOlympiad, being the j-ear of the City, 608, 24 some ages after the %0aperiod when those artists flourished, who produced all the %0aspecimens of what these persons now call Corinthian metal. %0aJt is in order, therefore, to refute this opinion, that I shall %0aBtate the age when these different artists lived ; for, if we %0areckon according to the above-mentioned era of the Olympiads, %0ait will be easy to compare their dates with the corresponding %0ayears of our City.

Although this ac- %0acount was generally received by the ancients, we may venture to assert, %0athat it cannot be correct; we cannot conceive the possibility of such a %0afusion taking place during the destruction of the city, or of the complete %0aunion of the components, in the mode in which they have been found to %0aexist— B, 3 » b.c. 146. — B. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 5.1 %0a%0a%0a%0aTHE JEGINETAN BRASS. %0a%0a%0a%0a151 %0a%0a%0a%0aare those -which these men of taste metamorphose, sometimes %0ainto dishes, sometimes into lamps, or even into washing- %0abasins, 25 without any regard to decency. They are of three %0akinds; the white variety, approaching very nearly to the %0asplendour of silver, and in which that metal forms a large %0aproportion of the compound; a second kind, in which the %0ayellow colour of gold predominates ; and a third, in which all %0athe metals are mixed in equal proportions. Besides these, %0athere is another mixture, the composition of which it is im- %0apossible to describe, for although it has been formed into %0aimages and statues by the hand of man, it is chance that rules %0ain the formation of the compound. This last is highly prized %0afor its colour, which approaches to that of liver, and it is %0aon this account that it is called " hepatizon :" 26 it is far in- %0aferior to the Corinthian metal, but much superior to the %0a^ginetan and Delian, which long held the first rank. %0a%0aCHAP 4. — THE BELIAN BRASS. %0a%0aThe Delian brass was the first 27 that became famous, all the %0aworld coming to Delos to purchase it; and hence the attention %0apaid to the manufacture of it. It was in this island that %0abrass first obtained celebrity for the manufacture of the feet %0aand supports of dining- couches. After some time it came %0ato be employed for the statues of the gods, and the effigies of %0amen and other animated beings. %0a%0aCHAP. 5. — THE JEGINETAN BRASS. %0a%0aThe next most esteemed brass was the JEginetan ; the %0aisland itself being rendered famous for its brass — not indeed %0athat the metal was produced there, but because the annealing %0aof the vEginetan manufactories was so excellent. A brazen %0aOx, which was taken from this island, now stands in the %0aForum JJcarinnr 8 at Eome. This is a specimen of the %0aJEginetan metal, as the Jupiter in the Temple of Jupiter %0a%0a25 "Trulleos." In an epigram of Martial, B. ix. Ep. 97, the word %0a" trulla" signifies a chamber-pot. 26 From the Greek i'/Trap, " the liver." %0a%0a21 The Lelian brass is mentioned by Cicero, in his oration " Pro Eoscio %0aAmerino," s. 46, and in his Fourth oration " In Verrem," s. 1. — B. Pau- %0asanias, in his "Eliaca," says that the Spanish copper, or copper of Tartes- %0asus, was the first known. %0a%0a2 » Or Cattle Market : in the Eighth Region of the City.

Myron 29 used the %0aformer metal and Polycletus 30 the latter; they were contem- %0aporaries and fellow-pupils, but there was great rivalry between %0athem as to their materials. %0a%0aCHAP. 6. (3.) — STANDS FOR LAMPS. %0a%0aiEgina was particularly famous for the manufacture of %0asockets only for lamp-stands, as Tarentum was for that of the %0abranches ; 31 the most complete articles were, therefore, pro- %0aduced by the union of the two. There are persons, too, who %0aare not ashamed to give for one a sum equal to the salary of %0aa military tribune, 3 - although, as its name indicates, its only %0ause is to hold a lighted candle. On the sale of one of these %0alamp-stands, Theon the public crier announced, that the pur- %0achaser must also take, as part of the lot, one Clesippus, a %0afuller, who was hump-backed, and in other respects, of a %0ahideous aspect. The purchase was made by a female named 33 %0aGegania, for fifty thousand sesterces. Upon her exhibiting %0athese purchases at an entertainment which she gave, the %0aslave, for the amusement of her guests, was brought in naked. %0aConceiving an infamous passion for him, she first admitted %0ahim to her bed, and finally left him all her estate. Having %0athus become excessively rich, he adored the lamp-stand as %0amuch as any divinity, and the story became a sort of pendant %0ato the celebrity of the Corinthian lamp-stands. Still, how- %0aever, good morals were vindicated in the end, for he erected a %0asplendid monument to her memory, and so kept alive the eternal %0aremembrance of the misconduct of Gegania. But although %0ait is well known that there are no lamp-stands in existence %0amade of the Corinthian metal, yet this name is very generally %0aattached to them, because, in consequence of the victory of %0a%0a29 A distinguished statuary and engraver on silver. He lived in Olym- %0apiad 87. Further mention is made of him by Cicero, Ovid, Strabo, and %0aPansanias. See also Chapter 19 of this Book. %0a%0a30 There were several artists of this name. The elder Polycletus, a %0anative either of Sicyon or of Argos, is probably the one here referred to. %0aFor further particulars of him, see Chapter 19. %0a%0a31 The words in the original are, respectively candelabra, superficies, %0aand scapi. — B. %0a%0a32 Probably a proverbial expression at Rome, as it is employed by Juve- %0anal, in an analogous manner, upon another occasion ; Sat. iii. 1. 132. B. %0a%0a33 Plutarch speaks of the Geganii as an ancient noble family at Koine.' %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 8.] %0a%0a%0a%0aCOUCHES OF HRASS. %0a%0a%0a%0a153 %0a%0a%0a%0aMummius, 34 Corinth was destroyed : at the same time, however, %0ait should be remembered that this victory dispersed a number %0aof bronzes which originally came from many other cities of %0aAchaia. %0a%0aCHAP 7. — ORNAMENTS OF THE TEMPLES MADE OF BRASS. %0a%0aThe ancients were in the habit of making the door-sills and %0aeven the doors of the temples of brass. I find it stated, also, %0athat Cneius Octavius, who obtained a naval triumph over King %0aPerseus, 35 erected the double portico to the Flaminian Circus, %0awhich was called the " Corinthian" from the brazen capitals of %0athe pillars. 36 It is stated also, that an ordinance was made that %0athe Temple of Vesta 37 should be covered with a coating of %0aSyracusan metal. The capitals, too, of the pillars, which were %0aplaced by M. Agrippa in the Pantheon, are made of similar %0ametal. Even the opulence, too, of private individuals has %0abeen wrested to similar purposes. Spurius Carvilius, the %0aquaestor, among the other charges which he brought against %0aCamillus, 38 accused him of having brazen doors in his house. %0a%0aCHAP. 8. COUCHES OF BRASS. %0a%0a"We learn fromL. Piso, 39 that Cneius Manlius was the first who %0aintroduced brazen banquetting-couches, buffets, and tables %0awith single feet, 40 when he entered the City in triumph, in the %0ayear of Home 567, after his conquests in Asia. We also %0alearn from Antias, 41 that the heirs of L. Crassus, the orator, %0asold a number of banquetting-couches adorned with brass. The %0a%0a34 See B. xxxiii. c. 53. » %0a%0a35 a.u.c. 585 ; we have an account of it in Livy, B. xiv. c. 42. — B. %0a%0a36 This building is referred to by Velleius Paterculus, in the beginning %0aof the Second Book of his History. — B. According to Aurelius Victor, %0ait was situated in the Ninth Region of the City. %0a%0a31 The Temple of Vesta is described by Ovid, Fasti, B. vi. 1. 265, %0aet seq. — B. %0a%0a38 C. Camillus probably, the Boman jurist and friend of Cicero. %0a%0a39 See end of B. ii. %0a%0a40 i%3c Triclinia," "abaci," and i( monopodia;" these appear to have been %0acouches for dining-tables, tables furnished with cupboards, and tables %0astanding on a single foot. Livy, B. xxxix. c. 6, informs us, that Cneius %0aManlius, in his triumphal procession, introduced into Rome various articles %0aof Asiatic luxury ; " Lectos aeratos, vestem stragulam preciosam, mono- %0apodia, et abacos." We are not to suppose that the whole of these articles %0awere made of brass, but that certain parts of them were formed of this %0ametal, or else were ornameuted with brass. — B. 11 See end of B. ii. %0a%0a%0a%0a154 %0a%0a%0a%0aplint's natural history. [Book XXXIV. %0a%0a%0a%0atripods, 42 which were called Delphian, because they were %0adevoted more particularly to receiving the offerings that were %0apresented to the Delphian Apollo, were usually made of brass : %0aalso the pendant lamps, 43 so much admired, which were placed %0ain the temples, or gave their light in the form of trees loaded %0aAvith fruit ; such as the one, for instance, in the Temple of the %0aPalatine Apollo, 44 which Alexander the Great, at the sacking %0aof Thebes, brought to Cyme, 45 and dedicated to that god. %0a%0aCHAP. 9. (4.) WHICH WAS THE FIRST STATUE OF A GOD MADE OF %0a%0aBRASS AT ROME. THE ORIGIN OF STATUES, AND THE RESPECT %0aPAID TO THEM. %0a%0aBut after some time the artists everywhere applied them- %0aselves to representations of the gods. I find that the first %0abrass image, which was made at Rome, was that of Ceres ; %0aand that the expenses were defrayed out of the property that %0abelonged to Spurius Cassius, who was put to death by his own %0afather, for aspiring to the regal office. 46 The practice, how- %0aever, soon passed from the gods to the statues and representa- %0ations of men, and this in various forms. The ancients stained %0atheir statues with bitumen, which makes it the more remark- %0aable that they were afterwards fond of covering them with %0agold. I do not know whether this was a Roman invention ; %0abut it certainly has the repute of being an ancient practice at %0aRome. %0a%0aIt was not the custom in former times to give the likeness %0aof individuals, except of such as deserved to be held in lasting %0aremembrance on account of some illustrious deed ; in the first %0ainstance, for a victory at the sacred games, and more particularly %0athe Olympic Games, where it was the usage for the victors %0aalways to have their statues consecrated. And if any one was %0aso fortunate as to obtain the prize there three times, his statue %0a%0a42 "Cortinas tripodum." These articles of furniture consisted of a %0atable or slab, supported by three feet, which was employed, like our side- %0aboards, tor the display of plate, at the Koman entertainments.— B. %0a%0ai3 " Lychnuchi peusiles ;" this term is applied by Suetonius, Julius, %0as. 37 ; we may conceive that they were similar to the modern chande- %0aliers. — B %0a%0a41 This temple was dedicated by Augustus a.u.c. 726. The lamps in it, %0aresembling trees laden with fruit, are mentioned by Victor in his descrip- %0ation of the Tenth Quarter of the City. — B. « See B. v. c. 32. %0a%0a46 "We have an account of this event in Livy, B. ii. c. 41, in Valerius %0aMaximus, and in Dionysius of Ilalicarnassus. — B. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 10.] THE DIFFERENT KINDS AND FOBilS OF STATUES. 155 %0a%0a%0a%0awas made with the exact resemblance of every individual %0alimb ; from which circumstance they were called " iconicae." 47 %0aI do not know whether the first public statues were not erected %0aby the Athenians, and in honour of Harmodius and Aris- %0atogiton, who slew the tyrant ; 48 an event which took place in %0athe same year in which the kings were expelled from Rome. %0aThis custom, from a most praiseworthy emulation, was after- %0awards adopted by all other nations ; so that statues were %0aerected as ornaments in the public places of municipal towns, %0aand the memory of individuals was thus preserved, their %0avarious honours being inscribed on the pedestals, to be read %0athere by posterity, and not on their tombs alone. After some %0atime, a kind of forum or public place came to be made in pri- %0avate houses and in our halls, the clients adopting this method %0aof doing honour to their patrons. %0a%0aCDAP. 10. (5.) THE DIFFERENT KINDS AND FORMS OF STATUES. %0a%0aSTATUES AT ROME WITH CUIRASSES. %0a%0aIn former times the statues that were thus dedicated were %0aclad in the toga. 49 Naked statues also, brandishing a spear, %0aafter the manner of the youths at their gymnastic exercises, %0aAvere much admired ; these were called " Achillean." The %0aGreek practice is, not to cover any part of the body ; while, %0aon the contrary, the Roman and the military statues have the %0aaddition of a cuirass. Caesar, the Dictator, permitted a statue %0awith a cuirass to be erected in honour of him in his Forum. 50 As %0ato the statues which are made in the garb of the Luperci,' 1 %0athey are of no older date than those which have been lately %0aerected, covered with a cloak. 52 Mancinus gave directions, %0athat he should be represented in the dress which he wore when %0ahe was surrendered to the enemy. 63 It has been remarked by %0a%0a47 "Iconicae," " portrait statues," from Ukwv, of the same meaning. %0aThis term is employed by Suetonius, in speaking of a statue of Caligula, %0ac. 22.— B. %0a%0a49 Pisistratus. These statues are mentioned in the 19th Chapter of this %0aBook, as being the workmanship of Praxiteles. — B. %0a%0a49 See B. vii. cc. 31, 34 : B. viii. c. 74 : and B. ix. c. 63. %0a%0aw Near the Temple of Janus, in the Eighth Region of the City. %0a%0a51 The Luperci were the priests of Pan, who, at the celebration of their %0agames, called Lupercalia, were in the habit of running about the streets of %0aRome, with no other covering than a goat's skin tied about the loins. — B. %0a%0aM M Psenula."

Attius," the poet, had a statue of him- %0aself erected in the Temple of the Muses, 45 which was extremely %0alarge, although he himself was very short- %0aEquestrian statues are also held in esteem in Rome ; but %0athe) r are of Greek origin, no doubt. Among the Greeks, those %0apersons only were honoured with equestrian statues who were %0avictors on horseback 66 in the sacred games ; though afterwards %0athe same distinction was bestowed on those who were success- %0aful in the races with chariots with two or four horses : hence %0athe use of chariots with us in the statues of those who have %0atriumphed. But this did not take place until a late period ; %0aand it was not until the time of the late Emperor Augustus, %0atli at we had chariots represented with six horses, 57 as also with %0aelephants. %0a%0aCHAP. 1 1 . IN HONOUR OF WHOM PUBLIC STATUES WERE FIRST %0a%0aEUECTED : IN HONOUR OF WHOM THEY WKKE FIRST PLACED ON %0aPILLARS : WHEN THE ROSTRA WERE FIKST ERECTED. %0a%0aThe custom of erecting chariots with two horses in honour %0aof those who had discharged the office of praetor, and had %0apassed round the Circus in a chariot, is not of ancient date. %0aThat of placing statues on pillars is older, as it was done in %0ahonour of C.

Minutius, the prsefect of the %0amarkets ; whose statue was erected without the Trigeminian %0aCiate, 61 by means of a tax of the twelfth of an as 63 per head : %0athe same thing, however, had been previously done by the %0asenate, and it would have been a more distinguished honour %0ahad it not had its origin on such frivolous occasions. The %0astatue of Attus Navius, 63 for example, was erected before the %0asenate-house, the pedestal of which was consumed when the %0asenate-house itself was burnt at the funeral of Publius Clo- %0adius. 6 * The statue of Hermodorus also, the Ephesian, 64 the %0ainterpreter of the laws which were transcribed by the Decem- %0avirs, was erected by the public in the Comitium. 66 %0a%0aIt was for a very different, and more important reason, that %0athe statue of Horatius Codes was erected, he having singly %0aprevented the enemy from passing the Sublician bridge ; 67 a %0astatue which remains to this day.

The equestrian statue of Marcius Tremulus, clad in the %0atoga, stood before the Temple of the Castors ; 69 him who twice %0asubdued the Samnitcs, and by the capture of Anagnia delivered %0athe people from their tribute. 10 Among the most ancient are %0athose of Tullus Cloelius, Lucius Poscius, Spurius Nautius, %0aand C. Fulcinus, near the liostra, all of whom were assas- %0asinated by the Fidenates, when on their mission as ambassa- %0adors. 71 It was the custom with the republic to confer this %0ahonour on those who had been unjustly put to death ; such as P. %0aJunius, also, and Titus Coruncanius, who were slain by Teuta, %0aqueen of the Illyrians. 72 It would be wrong not to mention %0awhat is stated in the Annals, that their statues, erected in %0athe Forum, were three feet in height ; whence it would appear %0athat such were the dimensions of these marks of honour in %0athose times. %0a%0aNor must I forget to mention Cneius Octavius, on account of %0athe language used by the senate. 73 When King Antiochus %0asaid, that he would give him an answer at another time, Oc- %0atavius drew a line round him with a stick, which he happened %0ato have in his hand, and compelled him to give an answer %0abefore he allowed him to step beyond the circle.

IN HONOUR OF WHAT FOREIGNERS PUBLIC STATUES %0a%0aWERE ERECTED AT ROME. %0a%0aI find also, that statues were erected in honour of Pytha- %0agoras and of Alcibiades, in the corners of the Comitium ; in obe- %0adience to the command of the Pythian Apollo, who, in the %0aSamnite War, 77 had directed that statues of the bravest and %0athe wisest of the Greeks should be erected in some conspicu- %0aous spot : and here they remained until Sylla, the Dictator, %0abuilt the senate-house on the site. It is wonderful that the %0asenate should then have preferred Pythagoras to Socrates, who, %0ain consequence of his wisdom, had been preferred to all other %0amen 78 by the god himself ; as, also, that they should have pre- %0aferred Alcibiades for valour to so many other heroes ; or, indeed, %0aany one to Themistocles, who so greatly excelled in both quali- %0aties. The reason of the statues being raised on columns, was, %0athat the persons represented might be elevated above other %0amortals ; the same thing being signified by the use of arches, %0aa new invention which had its origin among the Greeks. I %0aam of opinion that there is no one' to whom more statues were %0aerected than to Demetrius Phalereus 79 at Athens : for there %0awere three hundred and sixty erected in his honour, there %0abeing reckoned at that period no more days in the year : these, %0ahowever, were soon broken to pieces.

THE FIKST EQUESTRIAN STATUES PUBLICLY ERECTED %0a%0aAT ROME, AND IN HONOUR OF WHAT FEMALES STATUES WERE %0aPUBLICLY ERECTED THERE. %0a%0aPedestrian statues have been, undoubtedly, for a long time %0ain estimation at Rome : equestrian statues are, however, of %0aconsiderable antiquity, and females even have participated in %0atbis honour ; for the statue of Cluelia is equestrian, 81 as if it %0ahad not been thought sufficient to have her clad in the toga; %0aand this, although statues were not decreed to Lucretia, or to %0aBrutus, who had expelled the kings, and through both of whom %0adahlia had been given as a hostage. 82 I should have thought %0athat this statue, and that of Codes, were the first that were %0aerected at the public expense — for it is most likely that the %0astatues of Attus and the Sibyl were erected by Tarquinius, %0aand those of each of the other kings by themselves respectively %0a— had not Piso stated that the statue of Claelia was erected by %0athose who had been hostages with her, when they were given %0aup by Porsena, as a mark of honour. %0a%0aPut Annius Fetialis 83 states, on the other hand, that the %0aequestrian statue, which stood opposite the Temple of Jupiter %0aStator, in the vestibule of the house of Tarquinius Superbus, %0awas that of Valeria, 81 the daughter of the consul Publicola ; and %0athat she was the only person that escaped and swam across %0athe Tiber; the rest of the hostages that had been sent to %0aPorsena having been destroyed by a stratagem of Tarquinius. %0a%0aCHAP. 14. AT WHAT PERIOD ALL THE STATUES ERECTED BY %0a%0aPRIVATE INDIVIDUALS WERE REMOVED FROM THE PUBLIC %0aPLACES. %0a%0aWe are informed by L.

The statue also which Spurius %0aCassius, 86 who had aspired to the supreme authority, had %0aerected in honour of himself, before the Temple of Tellus, was %0amelted down by order of the censors ; for even in this respect, %0athe men of those days took precautions against ambition. %0a%0aThere are still extant some declamations by Cato, during %0ahis censorship, against the practice of erecting statues of %0awomen in the Iloman provinces. However, he could not %0aprevent these statues being erected at Rome even ; to Cornelia, %0afor instance, the mother of the Gracchi, and daughter of the %0aelder Scipio Africanus. She is represented in a sitting pos- %0ature, and the statue is remarkable for having no straps to the %0ashoes. This statue, which was formerly in the public Portico %0aof Metellus, is now in the Buildings of Octavia. 67 %0a%0aCHAP. 15. THE FIRST STATUES PUBLICLY ERECTED BY %0a%0aFOBEIGNEBS. %0a%0aThe first statue that was erected at Rome at the expense of %0aa foreigner was that of C. JElius, the tribune of the people, %0awho had introduced a law against Sthennius Statilius Lu- %0acanus, 88 for having twice attacked Thurii : on which account %0athe inhabitants of that place presented JElius with a statue %0aand a golden crown. At a later period, the same people %0aerected a statue to Fabricius, 89 who had delivered their city %0afrom a state of siege. From time to time various nations %0athus placed themselves under the protection of the Romans ; %0aand all distinctions were thereby so effectually removed, that %0astatues of Hannibal even are to be seen in three different %0aplaces in that city, within the walls of which, he alone of all %0aits enemies, had hurled his spear. 90 %0a%0a86 See Chapter 9. %0a%0a87 " In Octaviae operibus." These were certain public buildings, erected %0ain Rome by Augustus, and named by him after his sister Octavia ; they are %0amentioned by Suetonius. — B. %0a%0a88 Valerius Maximus refers to this event, but he names the individual %0aStatius Servilius, B. i. c. 8, § 6.— B. 69 See B. xxxiii. cc. 50, 54. %0a%0a90 \Ve have an account of the attack by Hannibal on Eome in the %0atwenty-sixth Book of Livy, but we have no mention of the particular cir- %0acumstance here referred to. — B. %0a%0a%0a%0aVOL.

(7.) — THAT TIT F.HE STATU A HIES IN ITALY ALSO %0a%0aAT AN EARLY PERIOD. %0a%0aVarious circumstances prove, that the art of making statues %0awas commonly practised in Italy at an early period. The %0astatue in the Cattle Market 91 is said to have heen consecrated %0ato Hercules by Evander ; it is called the triumphal Hercules, %0aand, on the occasion of triumphal processions, is arrayed in %0atriumphal vestments. And then besides, King Nuraa dedi- %0acated the statue of the two-faced Janus; 93 a deity who is %0aworshipped as presiding over both peace and war. The %0afingers, too, are so formed as to indicate three hundred and %0asixty-five days, 93 or in other words, the year ; thus denoting %0athat he is the god of time and duration. %0a%0aThere are also Etruscan statues dispersed in various parts %0aof the world, which beyond a doubt were originally made in %0aEtruria. I should have supposed that these had been the %0astatues only of divinities, had not Metrodorus 91 of Scepsis, who %0ahad his surname from his hatred to the Roman name, 94 re- %0aproached us with having pillaged the city of Volsinii for the %0asake of the two thousand statues which it contained. It %0aappears to me a singular fact, that although the origin of %0astatues was of such great antiquity in Italy, the images of the %0agods, which were consecrated to them in their temples, should %0ahave been formed either of wood or of earthenware, 98 until %0athe conquest of Asia, which introduced luxury among us. It %0awill be the best plan to enlarge upon the origin of the art of %0aexpressing likenesses, when we come to speak of what the %0a%0a91 " Forum Boari urn."

This last, however, has flourished to such an %0aextraordinary degree, that an account of it would fill many %0avolumes, if we were desirous of making an extensive acquaint- %0aance with the subject : but as to learning everything con- %0anected with it, who could do it ? %0a%0aCHAP. 17. THE IMMODERATE PRICES OF STATTES. %0a%0aIn the aedileship of M. Scaurus, there were three thousand %0astatues erected on the stage of what was a temporary theatre 97 %0aonly. Mummius, the conqueror of Achaia, filled the City %0awith statues ; he who at his death was destined not to leave a %0adowry to his daughter, 98 for why not mention this as an %0aapology for him ? The Luculli" also introduced many ar- %0aticles from abroad. Yet we learn from Mucianus, 1 who was %0athrice consul, that there are still three thousand statues in %0aRhodes, and it is supposed that there are no fewer in ex- %0aistence at Athens, at Olympia, and at Delphi. What living %0amortal could enumerate them all? or of what utility would %0abe such information ? Still, however, I may, perhaps, afford %0aamusement by giving some slight account of such of those works %0aof art as are in any way remarkable, and stating the names of %0athe more celebrated artists. Of each of these it would be %0aimpossible to enumerate all the productions, for Lysippus 2 %0aalone is said to have executed no less than fifteen hundred 2 * %0aworks of art, all of which were of such excellence that any %0aone of them might have immortalized him.

As a proof of successful, %0aness, I will adduce one example, and that of a figure which %0arepresented neither god nor man. We have seen in our own %0atime, in the Capitol, before it was last burnt by the party 4 of %0aVitellius, in the shrine of Juno there, a bronze figure of a dog %0alicking its wounds. Its miraculous excellence and its perfect %0atruthfulness were not only proved by the circumstance of its %0ahaving been consecrated there, but also by the novel kind of %0asecurity that was taken for its safety ; for, no sum appearing %0aequal to its value, it was publicly enacted that the keepers of %0ait should be answerable for its safety with their lives. %0a%0a%0a%0aCHAP. 18. — THE MOST CELEBRATED COLOSSAL STATUES IN THE %0aCITY. %0a%0aAs to boldness of design, the examples are innumerable; %0afor we see designed, statues of enormous bulk, known as %0acolossal statues and equal to towers in size. Such, for %0ainstance, is the Apollo in the Capitol, which was brought by %0aM. Lucullus from Apollonia, a city of Pontus, 5 thirty cubits %0ain height, and which cost five hundred talents : such, too, is %0athe statue of Jupiter, in the Campus Martius, dedicated by %0athe late Emperor Claudius, but which appears small in com- %0aparison from its vicinity to the Theatre of Pompeius : and such %0ais that at Tarentum, forty cubits in height, and the work of %0aLysippus. 6 It is a remarkable circumstance in this statue, %0athat though, as it is stated, it is so nicely balanced as to be %0amoveable by the hand, it has never been thrown down by a %0atempest. This indeed, the artist, it is said, has guarded %0aagainst, by a column erected at a short distance from it, %0aupon the side on which the violence of the wind required %0ato be broken. On account, therefore, of its magnitude, and %0athe great difficulty of moving it, Fabius Verrucosus 7 did not %0a%0a3 " Aureum."

This statue, fifty- six years after it was erected, was %0athrown down by an earthquake ; but even as it lies, it excites %0aour wonder and admiration.' Few men can clasp the thumb %0ain their arms, and its fingers are larger than most statues. %0aWhere the limbs are broken asunder, vast caverns are seen %0ayawning in the interior. Within it, too, are to be seen large %0amasses of rock, by the weight of which the artist steadied it %0awhile erecting it. It is said that it was twelve years before %0athis statue was completed, and that three hundred talents were %0aexpended upon it ; a sum raised from the engines of warfare %0awhich had been abandoned by King Demetrius, 10 when tired %0aof the long-protracted siege of Rhodes. In the same city %0athere are other colossal 6tatues, one hundred in number ; but %0athough smaller than the one already mentioned, wherever %0aerected, they would, any one of them, have ennobled the place. %0aIn addition to these, there are five colossal statues of the gods, %0awhich were made by Bryaxis. 11 %0a%0aColossal statues used also to be made in Italy. At all events, %0awe see the Tuscan Apollo, in the library of the Temple of %0aAugustus, 12 fifty feet in height from the toe ; and it is a question %0awhether it is more remarkable for the quality of the metal, or %0afor the beauty of the workmanship.

There are also, in the Capitol, two heads %0awhich are very much admired, and which were dedicated by %0athe Consul P.

He flourished in the eighty-third %0aOlympiad, about the year of our City, 300. To the same age %0abelong also his rivals Alcamenes, 30 Critias, 31 Nesiotes, 32 and %0aHegias. 33 Afterwards, in the eighty-seventh Olympiad, there %0awere Agelades, 34 Callon, 55 and Gorgias the Laconian. In the %0aninetieth Olympiad there were Polycletus, 36 Phradmon, 37 %0aMyron, 38 Pythagoras, 39 Scopas, 40 and Perellus. 41 Of these, %0aPolycletus had for pupils, Argius, 42 Asopodorus, Alexis, %0aAristides, 43 Phrynon, Dinon, Athenodorus, 44 and Demeas 45 the %0a%0a28 See B. vii. c. 39, B. xxxv. c. 34, and B. xxxvi. c. 4. %0a%0a29 "We have an account of this statue, and of the temple in which it was %0aplaced, hy Pausanias, B. v.

He was brother and in- %0astructor of the younger Polycletus, of Argos. He is mentioned also by Pau- %0asanias and Tatian. %0a%0a49 He is once mentioned by Pausanias, and there is still extant the basis %0aof one of his works, with his name inscribed. %0a%0a49 It is supposed that there were two artists of this name, both natives %0aof Sicyon, the one grandson of the other. They are lioth named by Pausanias. %0a%0a50 Probably a Sicyonian ; he is mentioned also by Pausanias. %0a%0aM As Pliny mentions two artists of this name, it is impossible to say to %0awhich of them Pausanias refers as being an Athenian, in B. vi. c. 4. %0a%0a5 - The elder artist of this name. He was an Athenian, and his sister %0awas the wife of Phocion. He is also mentioned by Plutarch and Pausanias. %0a%0a53 An Athenian ; he is mentioned also by Vitruvius, Pausanias, and %0aTatian. Winckelmann mentions an inscription relative to him, which, how- %0aever, appears to be spurious. %0a%0a54 He is mentioned also by Pausanias, and is supposed by Sillig to have %0abeen a Theban. %0a%0a55 Praxiteles held a high rank among the ancient sculptors, and may be %0aconsidered as second to Phidias alone ; he is frequently mentioned by Pausa- %0anias and various other classical writers. Pliny gives a further account of %0athe works of Praxiteles in the two following Books. — B. %0a%0a56 He was also an eminent painter, and is also mentioned by Quintilian, %0aDio Chrysostom, and Plutarch. %0a%0aM * Another reading is " Echion." 57 See B. xxxv. cc. 32, 36. %0a%0a5S This great artist, a native of Sicyon, has been already mentioned in %0aB. vii. c. 39, and in the two preceding Chapters of the present Book ; he is %0aagain mentioned in B. xxxv. c. 39. — B.

The same person is mentioned also by %0aStrabo, Lucian, and Suidas. %0a%0a62 An Athenian.

The %0amost celebrated of these artists, though born at different %0aepochs, have joined in a trial of skill in the Amazons which %0athey have respectively made. When these statues were dedi- %0acated in the Temple of Diana at Ephesus, it was agreed, in %0aorder to ascertain which was the best, that it should be left to %0athe judgment of the artists themselves who were then present : %0aupon which, it was evident that that was the best, which all %0athe artists agreed in considering as the next best to his own. %0aAccordingly, the first rank was assigned to Polycletus, the %0asecond to Phidias, the third to Cresilas, the fourth to Cydon, %0aand the fifth to Phradmon. 11 %0a%0a« See B. xxxv. c. 36. %0a%0a64 A Sicyonian, pupil of Lysippus.

The elder Cephisodotus has been already mentioned. See Note 52. %0a%0a68 Another son of Praxiteles. He is also alluded to by Pausanias, though %0anot by name. %0a%0a69 His country is uncertain, but he was preceptor of Mygdon of Soli. %0aSee B. xxxv. c. 40. %0a%0a70 Mentioned also by Tatian ; bis country is unknown. %0a%0a71 It is doubtful whether Pausanias alludes, in B. vi. c. 4, to this artist, %0aor to the one of the same name mentioned under Olymp. 102. See Note 51. %0a%0a72 Sillig suggests that this word is an adjective, denoting the country of %0aPolycles, in order to distinguish him from the elder Polycles. %0a%0a73 We learn from Pausanias that he worked in conjunction with Ti- %0amarchides. The other artists here mentioned are quite unknown. %0a%0a74 Sillig, in his " Dictionary of Ancient Artists," observes that " this %0apassage contains many foolish statements." Also that there is " an ob- %0avious intermix tore in it of truth and falsehood." %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 19.] %0a%0a%0a%0aCELEBRATED WORKS IN BRASS. %0a%0a%0a%0a171 %0a%0a%0a%0aPhidias, besides the Olympian Jupiter, which no one has %0aever equalled, also executed in ivory the erect statue of %0aMinerva, which is in the Parthenon at Athens. 75 He also %0amade in brass, beside the Amazon above mentioned, 76 a Minerva, %0aof such exquisite beauty, that it received its name from its fine %0aproportions."

It %0aappears that Cicero, Vitruvius, Strabo, Quintilian, Plutarch, and Lucian %0ahave also confounded these two artists ; but Pausanias, who is very correct %0ain the account which he gives us of all subjects connected with works of %0aart, was aware of the distinction ; and it is from his observations that we %0ahave been enabled to correct the error into which so many eminent writers %0ahad fallen. — B. %0a%0a83 Derived from the head-dress of the statue/which had the head orna- %0amented with a fillet " Lucian mentions it. %0a•* The " Spear-bearer." %0a%0a** " Canon."

As already mention- %0aed, 16 Lysippus was most prolific in his works, and made more %0astatues than any other artist. Among these, is the Man using the %0aBody-scraper, which Marcus Agrippa had erected in front of his %0aWarm Baths, 1 " and which wonderfully pleased the Emperor %0aTiberius. This prince, although in the beginning of his reign %0ahe imposed some restraint upon himself, could not resist the %0atemptation, and had this statue removed to his bed-chamber, %0ahaving substituted another for it at the baths : the people, %0ahowever, were so resolutely opposed to this, that at the theatre %0athey clamourously demanded the Apoxyomenos 19 to be replaced; %0aand the prince, notwithstanding his attachment to it, was %0aobliged to restore it. %0a%0aLysippus is also celebrated for his statue of the intoxicated %0aFemale Flute-player, his dogs and huntsmen, and, more parti- %0acularly, for his Chariot with the Sun, as represented by the %0aKhodians. 20 He also executed a numerous series of statues of %0aAlexander the Great, commencing from his childhood. 21 The %0aEmperor Nero was so delighted with his statue of the infant %0aAlexander, that he had it gilt : this addition, however, to its %0avalue, so detracted from its artistic beauty that the gold was %0aremoved, and in this state it was looked upon as still more %0aprecious, though disfigured by the scratches and seams which %0aremained upon it, and in which the gold was still to be seen." %0aHe also made the statue of Hephsestion, the friend of Alex %0aander the Great, which some persons attribute to Polycletus, %0awhereas that artist lived nearly a century before his time. 2 ' %0aAlso, the statue of Alexander at the chase, now consecrated at %0aDelphi, the figure of a Satyr, now at Athens, and the Squadron %0a%0a16 In Chapter 17 of this Book.— B. %0a%0a11 The same subject, which, as mentioned above, had been treated by %0aPolycletus.— B. 18 In the Eighth Region of the City. %0a%0a19 'AttoSvo/uvoj;, the Greek name of the statue, signifying one "scraping %0ahimself." 20 The head encircled with rays. %0a%0aM The lines of Horace are well known, in which he says, that Alex- %0aander would allow his portrait to be painted by no one except Apelles, nor %0ahis statue to be made by any one except Lysippus, Epist.

Lysippus also executed %0achariots of various kinds. He is considered to have contri- %0abuted very greatly to the art of statuary by expressing the %0adetails of the hair,- 6 and by making the head smaller than had %0abeen done by the ancients, and the body more graceful and less %0abulky, a method by which his statues were made to appear %0ataller. The Latin language has no appropriate name for that %0a" symmetry," 27 which he so attentively observed in his new and %0ahitherto untried method of modifying the squareness obser- %0avable in the ancient statues. Indeed, it was a common saying %0aof his, that other artists made men as they actually were, while %0ahe made them as they appeared to be. One peculiar character- %0aistic of his work, is the finish and minuteness which are ob- %0aserved in even the smallest details. Lysippus left three sons, %0awho were also his pupils, and became celebrated as artists, %0aLaippus, Bcedas, and, more particularly, Euthycrates; though %0athis last-named artist rivalled his father in precision rather %0athan in elegance, and preferred scrupulous correctness to grace- %0afulness. Nothing can be more expressive than his Hercules %0aat Delphi, his Alexander, his Hunter at Thespite, and his %0aEquestrian Combat. Equally good, too, are his statue of Tro- %0aphonius, erected in the oracular cave 28 of that divinity, his %0anumerous chariots, his Horse with the Panniers, 29 and his hounds. %0a%0aTisicrates, also a native of Sicyon, was a pupil of Euthy- %0acrates, but more nearly approaching the style of Lysippus ; so %0amuch so, that several of his statues can scarcely be distinguished %0afrom those of Lysippus ; his aged Theban, for example, his King %0aDemetrius, and his Peucestes, who saved the life of Alexander %0athe Great, and so rendered himself deserving of this honour. 30 %0a%0a24 A large group of equestrian statues, representing those of Alexan- %0ader's body-guard, who had fallen at the battle of the Granicus. %0a%0a25 a.u.c. 606. %0a%0a26 See the Greek Anthology, B. iv.

Strongylion 5 made a %0afigure of an Amazon, which, from the beauty of the legs, was %0aknown as the " Eucnemos," 6 and which Nero used to have carried %0aabout with him in his travels. Strongylion was the artist, %0a%0a98 A native of Argos, who flourished in the 95th Olympiad. He was the %0ason of Motho, and brother and instructor of the younger Polycletus of %0aArgos. Several of his statues are mentioned by Pausanias and Tatian. %0a%0a89 Ajasson thinks that three statues in the Royal Museum at Puns %0amay possibly be copies of this Discobolus of Naucydes. %0a%0a1 The Goddess of Health, and daughter of JSsculapius. Niceratus was %0aa native of Athens, and is also mentioned by Tatian. %0a%0a2 A " Female sacrificing." The reading is very doubtful. %0a%0a3 The "Man cooking entrails."

No one can commend Perillus ; 43 %0amore cruel even than the tyrant Phalaris 44 himself, he made %0afor him a brazen bull, asserting that when a man was enclosed %0ain it, and fire applied beneath, the cries of the man would %0aresemble the roaring of a bull : however, with a cruelty in %0athis instance marked by justice, the experiment of this torture %0awas first tried upon himself. To such a degree did this man %0adegrade the art of representing gods and men, an art more %0aadapted than any other to refine the feelings ! Surely so many %0apersons had not toiled to perfect it in order to make it an instru- %0ament of torture ! Hence it is that the works of Perillus are %0aonly preserved, in order that whoever sees them, may detest %0athe hands that made them. %0a%0aSthennis 45 made the statues of Ceres, Jupiter, and Minerva, %0awhich are now in the Temple of Concord ; also figures of ma- %0atrons weeping, adoring, and offering sacrifice ; Simon 46 exe- %0acuted figures of a dog and an archer.

Being always dissatisfied with him- %0aself, and continually correcting his works, he obtained the name %0aof " Catatexitechnos ;" 66 thus affording a memorable example %0aof the necessity of observing moderation even in carefulness. %0aHis Baconian Female Dancers, for instance, is a most correct %0aperformance, but one in which, by extreme correctness, he has %0aeffaced all gracefulness. It has been said, too, that Calli- %0amachus was a painter also.

PYBOPUS. CAMPANIAN COPPEB. %0a%0aWe will now return to the different kinds of copper, and its %0aseveral combinations. In Cyprian copper we have the kind %0aknown as " coronarium," 71 and that called "regulare," 71 * both %0aof them ductile. The former is made into thin leaves, and, %0aafter being coloured with ox-gall, 72 is used for what has all %0athe appearance of gilding on the coronets worn upon the stage. %0aThe same substance, if mixed with gold, in the proportion of %0asix scruples of gold to the ounce, and reduced into thin plates, %0aacquires a fiery red colour, and is termed " pyropus."™ In %0aother mines again, they prepare the kind known as "regulare," %0aas also that which is called " caldarium." 74 These differ from %0aeach other in this respect, that, in the latter, the metal is only %0afused, and breaks when struck with the hammer, whereas the %0a"regulare" is malleable, or ductile, 73 as some call it, a property %0awhich belongs naturally to all the copper of Cyprus. In the %0acase, however, of all the other mines, this difference between %0abar copper and cast brass is produced by artificial means.

" Cliaplet " copper. %0a71 * " Bar" copper, or "malleable." %0a%0a72 It is very improbable that this effect could be produced by the cause %0ahere assigned ; but without a more detailed account of the process em- %0aployed, we cannot explain the change of colour. — B. %0a%0a73 Tlvpotirie, " sparkling like fire."

JJohn's Edition. %0a%0a%0a%0a190 %0a%0a%0a%0aplixt's natural history. %0a%0a%0a%0a[Book XXXIV. %0a%0a%0a%0athe ores, in fact, will produce bar or malleable copper when %0asufficiently melted and purified by heat. Among the other %0akinds of copper, the palm of excellence is awarded to that of %0aCampania, 76 which is the most esteemed for vessels and utensils. %0aThis last is prepared several ways. At Capua it is melted %0aupon fires made with wood, and not coals, after which it %0ais sprinkled with cold water and cleansed through a 6ieve %0amade of oak. After being thus smelted a number of times, %0aSpanish silver-lead is added to it, in the proportion of ten %0apounds of lead to one hundred pounds of copper ; a method %0aby which it is rendered pliable, and made to assume that agree- %0aable colour which is imparted to other kinds of copper by the %0aapplication of oil and the action of the sun. Many parts, %0ahowever, of Italy, and the provinces, produce a similar kind %0aof metal ; but there they add only eight pounds of lead, and, %0ain consequence of the scarcity of wood, melt it several times %0aover upon coals. It is in Gaul more particularly, where the %0aore is melted between red-hot stones, that the difference is to %0abe seen that is produced by these variations in the method of %0asmelting. Indeed, this last method scorches the metal, and %0arenders it black and friable. Besides, they only melt it twice; %0awhereas, the oftener this operation is repeated, the better in %0aquality it becomes. %0a%0a(9.) It is also as well to remark that all copper fuses best %0awhen the weather is intensely cold. The proper combination %0afor making statues and tablets is as follows : the ore is first %0amelted ; after which there is added to the molten metal one %0athird part of second-hand 77 copper, or in other words, copper %0athat has been in use and bought up for the purpose. For it %0ais a peculiarity of this metal that when it has been some time %0ain use, and has been subject to long-continued friction, it be- %0acomes seasoned, and subdued, as it were, to a high polish. %0aTwelve pounds and a half of silver-lead are then added to %0aevery hundred pounds of the fused metal. There is also a %0acombination of copper, of a most delicate nature, " mould- %0acopper," 77 * as it is called ; there being added to the metal one %0a%0a76 In the former Editions the whole of the next ten lines, from this word %0adown to "sun" is omitted.

By the addition of lead to %0aCyprian copper, the purple tint is produced that we see upon %0athe drapery of statues. %0a%0aCHAP. 21. — THE METHOD OP PRESERVING COPPER. %0a%0aCopper becomes covered with verdigris more quickly when %0acleaned than when neglected, unless it is well rubbed with %0aoil. It is said that the best method of preserving it is %0awith a coating of tar. The custom of making use of copper %0afor monuments, which are intended to be perpetuated, is of %0avery ancient date : it is upon tablets of brass that our public %0aenactments are engraved. %0a%0aCHAP 22. (10.) — CADMIA. %0a%0aThe ores of copper furnish a number of resources 83 that are %0aemployed in medicine ; indeed, all kinds of ulcers are healed %0athereby with great rapidity. Of these, however, the most %0auseful is cadmia. 83 This substance is formed artificially, %0a%0a18 " Piumbi nigri" — " black lead," literally, but not what we mean by %0athat name. %0a%0a19 The " Grecian" colour. It does not appear to have been identified, %0anor does it appear what it has to do with moulds. %0a%0a80 " Pot" copper, or brass. %0a%0a81 Beckmann is of opinion that this " plumbum argentarium" was a %0amixture of equal parts of tin and lead. Hist. Inv. Vol. II. p. 220. Boku's %0aEdition. %0a%0a62 Most of these preparations are in reality highly dangerous. Oxides, %0ahowever, or salts of copper, have been employed internally with success, %0aacting by alvine evacuation and by vomiting. The Crocus Veneris of the %0aold chemists was an oxide of copper. It is still used by the peasants of %0aSilesia, Ajasson says. %0a%0a83 It is obvious that the "cadmia" here described must be an essen- %0atially different substance from the M cadmia " mentioned in the second %0aChapter of this Book, that being a natural production, possibly calamine %0aor hydrosilicate or carbonate of zinc ; while the "cadmia" of this Chapter %0ais a furnace-calamine, a product of the fusion of the ore of copper, or %0azinc. — B. It is evident, too, that copper ores, impregnated with zinc or ca- %0alamine, also passed under this name. See Beckmann, Hist. Inv. Vol. II. %0app. 33—35, Bonn's Edition, where this subject is discussed at considerable %0alength : also the treatise by Delafosse, in Lemaire's Edition of Pliny. %0a%0a%0a%0a192 %0a%0a%0a%0apliny's natural histoey. %0a%0a%0a%0a[Book XXXIV. %0a%0a%0a%0abeyond a doubt, in the furnaces, also, where they smelt silver, %0abut it is whiter and not so heavy, and by no means to be com- %0apared with that from copper. There are several kinds of it. For, %0aas the mineral itself, from which it is prepared artificially, so %0anecessary in fusing copper ore, and so useful in medicine, has %0athe name of u cadmia," 84 so also is it found in the smelting, %0afurnaces, where it receives other names, according to the way in %0awhich it is formed. By the action of the flame and the blast, %0athe more attenuated parts of the metal are separated, and %0abecome attached, in proportion to their lightness, to the %0aarched top and sides of the furnace. These flakes are the %0athinnest near the exterior opening of the furnace, where the %0aflame finds a vent, the substance being called " capnitis ;" M %0afrom its burnt appearance and its extreme lightness it re- %0asembles white ashes. The best is that which is found in the %0ainterior, hanging from the arches of the chimney, and from its %0aform and position named " botryitis." b6 It is heavier than the %0afirst- mentioned kind, but lighter than those which follow.

It is then pulverized in a mortar and macerated in %0arain water, the sediment being again pounded until it is %0areduced to the consistency of ceruse, and presents no gritti- %0aness to the teeth.

Copper too, itself, when calcined, is employed for %0aall these purposes ; in addition to which it is used for white %0aspots and cicatrizations upon the eyes. Mixed with milk, it %0ais curative also of ulcers upon the eyes ; for which purpose, %0athe people in Egypt make a kind of eye-salve by grinding it %0aupon whet stones. Taken with honey, it acts as an emetic. %0aFor these purposes, Cyprian copper is calcined in unbaked %0aearthen pots, with an equal quantity of sulphur ; the apertures %0aof the vessel being well luted, and it being left in the furnace %0auntil the vessel itself has become completely hardened. Some %0apersons add salt, and others substitute alum 93 for sulphur; %0aothers, again, add nothing, but merely sprinkle the copper with %0avinegar.

These scales are %0aalso separated, when the cakes of metal are plunged into %0awater: they become red, too, like the scales of copper known %0aas "lepis," 97 by means of which the genuine flower of copper %0ais adulterated, it being ako sold under that name. This last is %0amade by hammering nails that are forged from the cakes of %0ametal. All these processes are principally carried on in the %0afurnaces of Cyprus ; the great difference between these sub- %0astances being, that this lepis is detached from the cakes by %0ahammering, whereas the flower falls off spontaneously. %0a%0aCHAP. 25. — STOMOMA OF COPTER; FORTY-SEVEN REMEDIES. %0a%0aThere is another finer kind of scale which is detached from %0athe surface of the metal, like a very fine down, and known %0aas " stomoma." 98 But of all these substances, and even of %0atheir names, the physicians, if I may venture so to say, are %0aquite ignorant, as appears by the names they give them ; so %0a%0a95 See B. xxxiii. c. 37. %0a%0a96 " ^ris flos."

At the present day, whenever they %0ahappen to find a book of recipes, if they wish to make any %0acomposition from these substances, or, in other words, to make %0atrial of the prescription at the expense of their unhappy %0apatients, they trust entirely to the druggists, 1 who spoil %0aeverything by their fraudulent adulterations. For this long %0atime past, they have even purchased their plasters and eye- %0asalves ready made, and the consequence is, that the spoiled or %0aadulterated wares in the druggists' shops are thus got rid of. %0a%0aBoth lepis and flower of copper are calcined in shallow %0aearthen or brazen pans; after which they are washed, as %0adescribed above, 2 and employed for the same purposes ; in addi- %0ation to which, they are used for excrescences in the nostrils and %0ain the anus, as also for dullness of the hearing, being forcibly %0ablown into the ears through a tube. Incorporated with meal, %0athey are applied to swellings of the uvula, and, with honey, to %0aswellings of the tonsils. The scales prepared from white %0acopper are much less efficacious than those from Cyprian %0acopper.

Sometimes it is detached already formed, %0afrom the mineral from which copper is smelted : and some- %0atimes it is made by piercing holes in white copper, and sus- %0apending it over strong vinegar in casks, which are closed with %0acovers ; it being much superior if scales of copper are used for %0athe purpose. Some persons plunge vessels themselves, made %0aof white copper, into earthen pots filled with vinegar, and %0ascrape them at the end of ten days. Others, again, cover the %0avessels with husks of grapes, 4 and scrape them in the same %0away, at the end of ten days. Others sprinkle vinegar upon %0acopper filings, and stir them frequently with a spatula in the %0acourse of the day, until they are completely dissolved. Others %0aprefer triturating these filings with vinegar in a brazen %0amortar : but the most expeditious method of all is to add to %0athe vinegar shavings of coronet copper. 4 Rhodian verdigris, %0amore particularly, is adulterated with pounded marble ; some %0apersons use pumice-stone or gum. %0a%0aThe adulteration, however, which is the most difficult to %0adetect, is made with copperas; 0 the other sophistications %0abeing detected by the crackling of the substance when bitten %0awith the teeth. The best mode of testing it is by using an %0airon fire-shovel; for when thus subjected to the fire, if pure, %0athe verdigris retains its colour, but if mixed with copperas, it %0abecomes red. The fraud may also be detected by using a leaf %0aof papyrus, which has been steeped in an infusion of nut-galls; %0afor it becomes black immediately upon the genuine verdigris %0abeing applied. It may also be detected by the eye ; the green %0acolour being unpleasant to the sight. But whether it is pure %0aor adulterated, the best method is first to wash and dry it, and %0athen to burn it in a new earthen vessel, turning it over until %0ait is reduced to an ash ;' after which it is pounded and put by %0afor use. Some persons calcine it in raw earthen vessels, until %0athe earthenware becomes thoroughly baked : others again add %0ato it male frankincense. 8 Verdigris is washed, too, in the same %0amanner as cadmia. %0a%0a4 According to Brotcro, this is the process generally adopted in France, %0ain preference to the employment of vinegar in a pure state. — B. %0a%0a5 The form of copper which was termed "coronarium" has been already %0adescribed in Chapter 22. — B. %0a%0a6 " Atramento sutorio."

HIERACITJM. %0a%0a'•' Hieracium" 9 is the name given to an eye-salve, which is %0aessentially composed of the following ingredients ; four ounces %0aof sal ammoniac, two of Cyprian verdigris, the same quantity %0aof the kind of copperas which is called " chalcanthum," 10 one %0aounce of misy 11 and six of saffron; all these substances being %0apounded together with Thasian vinegar and made up into %0apills. It is an excellent remedy for incipient glaucoma and %0acataract, as also for films upon the eyes, eruptions, albugo, %0aand diseases of the eye-lids. Verdigris, in a crude state, is %0aalso used as an ingredient in plasters for wounds. In com- %0abination with oil, it is wonderfully efficacious for ulcerations %0aof the mouth and gums, and for sore lips. Used in the form %0aof a cerate, it acts detergently upon ulcers, and promotes their %0acicatrization. Verdigris also consumes the callosities of fis- %0atulas and excrescences about the anus, either used by itself, %0aapplied with sal ammoniac, or inserted in the fistula in the %0aform of a salve.

CHALCITIS: SEVEN REMEDIES. %0a%0aChalcitis 11 is the name of a mineral, from which, as well as %0acadmia, copper is extracted by heat. It differs from cadmia %0ain this respect, that this last is procured from beds below the %0asurface, while chalcitis is detached from rocks that are exposed %0ato the air. Chalcitis also becomes immediately friable, being %0anaturally so soft as to have the appearance of a compressed %0amass of down. There is also this other distinction between %0athem, that chalcitis is a composition of three other substances, %0acopper, misy, and sory, 15 of which last we shall speak in their %0aappropriate places. 18 The veins of copper which it contains are %0aoblong. The most approved kind is of the colour of honey ; %0ait is streaked with fine sinuous veins, and is friable and not %0astony. It is generally thought to be most valuable when fresh, %0aas, when old, it becomes converted into sory. It is highly %0auseful for removing fleshy excrescences in ulcers, for arresting %0ahaemorrhage, and, in the form of a powder, for acting as- %0a%0allour used in cookery."— Beckmann, Hist. Inv.

He informs us that he has re- %0aceived a specimen of a native sulphate of copper from Cuenca, in Spain, %0awhich possesses all the characteristics of " sory" as here described. He %0aconsiders it more difficult to ascertain the chemical composition of " misy," %0abut is disposed to consider it as a mixed sulphate of iron and copper. — B. %0a%0a16 In the next two Chapters.— B. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 31.] %0a%0a%0a%0aMISY. %0a%0a%0a%0a199 %0a%0a%0a%0atringently upon the gums, the uvula, and the tonsillary glands. 17 %0aIt is applied in wool, as a pessary, for affections of the uterus ; %0aand with leek juice it is formed into plasters for diseases of %0athe genitals. This substance is macerated for forty days in %0avinegar, in an earthen vessel luted with dung; after which it %0aacquires a saffron colour. When this composition is mixed with %0aan equal proportion of cadmia, it forms the medicament known %0aas " psoricon." 18 If two parts of chalcitis are combined with %0aone of cadmia, the medicament becomes more active ; and it is %0arendered still more powerful if vinegar is used instead of wine. %0aTor all these purposes, calcined chalcitis is the most efficacious. %0a%0achap. 30. — soey : th bee remedies. %0a%0aThe sory 19 of Egypt is the most esteemed, being considered %0amuch superior to that of Cyprus, Spain, and Africa ; although %0asome prefer the sory from Cyprus for affections of the eyes, %0aliut from whatever place it comes, the best is that which has %0athe strongest odour, and which, when triturated, becomes %0agreasy, black, and spongy. It is a substance so unpleasant to %0athe stomach, that some persons are made sick merely by its %0asmell. This is the case more particularly with the sory from %0aEgypt. That from other countries, by trituration, acquires %0athe lustre of misy, and is of a more gritty consistency.

For these maladies, sixteen drachmae %0ashould be mixed with one semisextarius of vinegar, and boiled %0awith the addition of some honey, until it becomes of a viscous %0aconsistency; in which state it is applicable to the different %0apurposes above mentioned. When its action is wanted to be %0amodified, a sprinkling of honey is added. A fomentation of %0amisy and vinegar removes the callosities of fistulous ulcers ; %0ait also enters into the composition of eye-salves. It arrests %0ahaemorrhage, prevents the spreading of serpiginous and putrid %0aulcers, and consumes fleshy excrescences.

Upon being removed, %0ait is dried for thirty days. It is of an azure colour, and of a %0abrilliant lustre, and is often taken for glass. When dissolved, %0ait forms the black dye that is used for colouring leather. %0a%0aChalcanthum is also prepared in various other ways : the %0aearth which contains it being sometimes excavated into %0atrenches, from the sides of which globules exude, which %0abecome concrete when exposed to the action of the winter %0afrosts. This kind is called " stalagmia," 28 and there is none %0amore pure. When its colour is nearly white, with a slight %0atinge of violet, it is called "lonchoton." 29 It is also prepared %0ain pans hollowed out in the rocks ; the rain water carrying tbe %0aslime into them, where it settles and becomes hardened. It is %0aalso formed in the same way in which we prepare salt ; 30 the %0aintense heat of the sun separating the fresh water from it. %0aHence it is that some distinguish two kinds of chalcanthum, %0athe fossil and the artificial ; the latter being paler than the %0aformer, and as much inferior to it in quality as it is in %0acolour. %0a%0aThe chalcitis which comes from Cyprus is the most highly, %0aesteemed for the purposes of medicine, being taken in doses of %0aone drachma with honey, as an expellent of intestinal worms. %0aDiluted and injected into the nostrils, it acts detergently %0aupon the brain, and, taken with honey or with hydromel, it %0aacts as a purgative upon the stomach. It removes granula- %0ations upon the eye-lids, and is good for pains and films upon %0athe eyes ; it is curative also of ulcerations of the mouth. It %0aarrests bleeding at the nostrils, and hfemorrhoidal discharges. %0aIn combination with seed of hyoscyamus, it brings away %0asplinters of broken bones. Applied to the forehead with a %0asponge, it acts as a check upon defluxions of the eyes.

(13.) — pompholyx. %0aThe substances called pompholyx 31 and spodos 32 are also %0afound in the furnaces of copper-smelting works ; the dilference %0abetween them being, that pompholyx is disengaged by wash- %0aing, while spodos is not washed. Some persons have called the %0apart which is white and very light " pompholyx," and say that %0ait is the ashes of copper and cadmia; whereas spodos is darker %0aund heavier, being a substance scraped from the walls of the %0afurnace, mixed with extinguished sparks from the metal, and %0asometimes with the residue of coals. When vinegar is combined %0awith it, pompholyx emits a coppery smell, and if it is touched %0awith the tongue, the taste is most abominable.

This substance, which i3 the lightest %0apart of the metal disengaged by fusion, escapes from the fur- %0anace, and adheres to the roof, beiDg distinguished from the %0asoot by the whiteness of its colour. Such parts of it as are %0aless white are indicative of incomplete combustion, and it is this %0awhich some persons call " pompholyx." Such portions of it as %0aare of a more reddish colour are possessed of a more energetic %0apower, and are found to be so corrosive, that if it touches %0athe eyes, while being washed, it will cause blindness. There %0ais also a spodos of a honey colour, an indication that it con- %0atains a large proportion of copper. All the different kinds, %0ahowever, are improved by washing ; it being first skimmed with %0aa feather, 34 aud afterwards submitted to a more substantial %0awashing, the harder grains being removed with the finger. That, %0atoo, which has been washed with wine is more modified in its %0aeffects ; there being also some difference according to the kind of %0awine that is used. When it has been washed with weak wine %0athe spodos is considered not so beneficial as an ingredient in %0amedicaments for the eyes ; but the same kind of preparation is %0amore efficacious for running sores, and for ulcers of the mouth %0aattended with a discharge of matter, as well as in all those %0aremedies which are used for gangrene. %0a%0aThere is also a kind of spodos, called " lauriotis," 35 which %0ais made in the furnaces where silver is smelted. The kind, %0ahowever, that is best for the eyes, it is said, is that produced in %0athe furnaces for smelting gold. Indeed there is no department %0aof art in which the ingenuity of man is more to be admired ; %0afor it has discovered among the very commonest objects, a %0asubstance that is in every way possessed of similar properties. %0a%0aCHAP. 35.

SMEGMA. %0a%0aIn the copper forges also smegma 41 is prepared. When the %0ametal is liquefied and thoroughly smelted, charcoal is added %0ato it and gradually kindled ; after which, upon it being sud- %0adenly acted upon by a powerful pair of bellows, a substance is %0adisengaged like a sort of copper chaff. The floor on which %0ait is received ought to be prepared with a stratum of coal-dust. %0a%0aCnAP. 37. DIPHBYX. %0a%0aThere is another product of these furnaces, which is easily %0adistinguished from smegma, and which the Greeks call " di- %0aphryx,''" from its being twice calcined. This substance is pre- %0apared from three different sources. It is prepared, they say, %0afrom a mineral pyrites, which is heated in the furnace until %0ait is converted by calcination into a red earth. It is also %0amade in Cyprus, from a slimy substance extracted from a cer- %0atain cavern there, which is first dried and then gradually heated, %0aby a fire made of twigs. A third way of making it, is from %0athe residue in the copper-furnaces that falls to the bottom. %0aThe difference between the component parts of the ore is this; %0athe copper itself runs into the receivers, the scoriae make their %0aescape from the furnace, the flower becomes sublimated, and %0athe diphryx remains behind. %0a%0aSome say that there are certain globules in the ore, while %0abeing smelted, which become soldered together; and that the %0arest of the metal is fused around it, the mass itself not becoming %0aliquefied, unless it is transferred to another furnace, and forming %0aa sort of knot, as it were, in the metal. That which remains %0aafter the fusion, they say, is called "diphryx.

PABTICULAKS RELATIVE XO THE SERVILIAN TKIEITS. %0a%0a"We must not neglect to mention one other very remarkable %0afact relative to copper. The Servilian family, so illustrious in %0aour annals, nourishes with gold and silver a copper triens, 44 %0awhich devours them both. The origin and nature of this coin is %0ato me incomprehensible ; ls but I will quote the very words of %0athe story, as given by old Messala 46 himself — " The family of %0athe Servilii is in possession of a sacred triens, to which they %0aoffer every year a sacrifice, with the greatest care and magnifi- %0acence ; the triens itself, they say, appears sometimes to increase %0ain size and sometimes to diminish ; changes which indicate the %0acoming advancement or decadence of the family." %0a%0aCHAP. 39 (14). — IKON ORES. %0a%0aNext to copper we must give an account of the metal known %0aas iron, at the same time the most useful and the most fatal %0ainstrument in the hand of mankind. For by the aid of iron %0awe lay open the ground, we plant trees, we prepare our vine- %0ayard-trees, 47 and we force our vines each year to resume their %0ayouthful state, by cutting away their decayed branches. It is %0aby the aid of iron that we construct houses, cleave rocks, and %0aperform so many other useful offices of life. But it is with %0airon also that wars, murders, and robberies are effected, and %0athis, not only hand to hand, but from a distance even, by the %0aaid of missiles and winged weapons, now launched from en- %0agines, now hurled by the human arm, and now furnished with %0afeathery wings. This last I regard as the most criminal %0aartifice that has been devised by the human mind; for, as %0aif to bring death upon man with still greater rapidity, we %0ahave given wings to iron and taught it to fly. 48 Let us there- %0a%0a14 A Roman coin, equal to the third part of the " as."— B. %0a%0a* s We roost fully coincide with Pliny in this sentiment, but we are %0aconstrained to differ from him in giving credit to the alleged fact, as he %0aappears to have done. — B. %0a%0a- 16 See the list of authors at the end of this Book. %0a%0a47 " Arbusta:" trees on which vines were trained.

STATUES OF IRON ; CHASED WORKS IN IEON. %0a%0aStill, however, human industry has not failed to employ iron %0afor perpetuating the honours of more civilized life. The %0aartist Aristonidas, wishing to express the fury of Athamas %0asubsiding into repentance, after he had thrown his son Learchus %0afrom the rock, 51 blended copper and iron, in order that the %0ablush of shame might be more exactly expressed, by the rust of %0athe iron making its appearance through the shining substance of %0athe copper ; a statue which still exists at Rhodes. There is also, %0ain the same city, a Hercules of iron, executed by Alcon, 52 the %0aendurance displayed in his labours by the god having suggested %0athe idea. We see too, at Rome, cups of iron consecrated in %0athe Temple of Mars the Avenger. 53 Nature, in conformity %0awith her usual benevolence, has limited the power of iron, by %0ainflicting upon it the punishment of rust ; and has thus dis- %0aplayed her usual foresight in rendering nothing in existence %0amore perishable, than the substance which brings the greatest %0adangers upon perishable mortality. %0a%0aCHAP. 41.— THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF IRON, AND THE MODE OF %0aTEMPERING IT. %0a%0aIron ores are to be found almost everywhere ; for they exist %0a%0a* The charge that death is always the work of Nature.

The method of -working %0athe ore is the 6ame as that employed in the case of copper. In %0aCappadocia, however, it is peculiarly questionable whether this %0ametal is a present due to the water or to the earth ; because, %0awhen the latter has been saturated with the water of a certain %0ariver, it yields, and then only, an iron that may be obtained %0aby smelting. %0a%0aThere are numerous varieties of iron ore ; the chief causes %0aof which arise from differences in the soil and in the climate. %0aSome earths produce a metal that is soft, and nearly akin to %0alead ; others an iron that is brittle and coppery, the use of which %0amust be particularly avoided in making wheels or nails, the %0aformer kind being better for these purposes. There is another %0akind, again, which is only esteemed when cut into short lengths, %0aand is used for making hobnails ; 65 and another which is %0amore particularly liable to rust. All these varieties are known %0aby the name of " strictura," 56 an appellation which is not used %0awith reference to the other metals, and is derived from the steel %0athat is used for giving an edge. 57 There is a great difference, %0a%0a54 The Isle of Elba, which has been celebrated for the extent and the %0arichness of its iron mines both by the ancients and the moderns. — B. %0aAjasson remarks that it appears to be a solid rock composed of peroxide %0aof iron. %0a%0a55 " Clavis caligariis." See B. viii. c. 44. B. ix. c. 33, and B. xxii. c. 46. %0a%0a56 There have been numerous opinions on the meaning of this word, %0aand its signification is very doubtful. Beckmann has the following re- %0amarks in reference to this passage : — " In my opinion, this was the name %0agiven to pieces of steel completely manufactured and brought to that state %0awhich rendered them fit for commerce. At present steel comes from %0aBiscay in cakes, from other places in bars, and both these were formerly %0acalled ' strictures,' because they were employed chiefly for giving sharpness %0ato instruments, or tools, that is, for steeling them. In speaking of other %0ametals, Pliny says that the finished productions at the works were not called %0a'strieturae' (the case, for example, with copper), though sharpness could %0ahe given to instruments with other metals also. The words of Pliny just %0aquoted are read different ways, and still remain obscure. I conjecture %0athat he meant to say, that some steel-works produced things which were %0aentirely of steel, and that others were employed only in steeling— 'ad %0adensandas incudes malleorumve rostra.' I shall here remark that these %0a'strieturae ferri' remind us of the ' striges auri,' (see B. xxxiii. c. 19), %0asuch being the name given to native pieces of gold, which, without being %0asmelted, were used in commerce." — Hist. Inv. Vol. II. p. 327. Bohn'a %0aEdition. %0a%0abl " A stringenda acie." The iron was probably formed into thin, %0a%0a%0a%0a203 %0a%0a%0a%0apliny's natural histort. %0a%0a%0a%0a[Book XXXIV. %0a%0a%0a%0atoo, in the smelting ; some kinds producing knurrs of metal, %0awhich are especially adapted for hardening into steel, or else, %0aprepared in another manner, for making thick anvils or heads %0aof hammers. But the main difference results from the quality of %0athe w ater into which the red-hot metal is plunged from time to %0atime. The water, which is in some places better for this pur- %0apose than in others, has quite ennobled some localities for the %0aexcellence of their iron, Bilbilis, 68 for example, and Turiasso 49 %0ain Spain, and Comum 60 in Italy; and this, although there are %0ano iron mines in these spots. %0a%0aBut of all the different kinds of iron, the palm of excellence %0ais awarded to that which is made by the Seres, 01 who send it to %0aus with their tissues and skins ; 62 next to which, in quality, is %0athe Parthian 63 iron. Indeed, none of the other kinds of iron are %0amade of the pure hard metal, a softer alloy being welded with %0athem all. In our part of the world, a vein of ore is occasionally %0afound to yield a metal of this high quality, as in Noricum 64 for %0ainstance ; but, in other cases, it derives its value from the %0amode of working it, as at Sulmo, 65 for example, a result owing %0ato the nature of its water, as already stated. It is to be ob- %0aserved also, that in giving an edge to iron, there is a great differ- %0aence between oil-whetstones and water- whetstones, 66 the use %0aof oil producing a much finer edge. It is a remarkable fact, %0athat when the ore is fused, the metal becomes liquefied like %0a%0along bars, in thickness resembling a steel used for sharpening. The %0aFrench word acier, meaning " steel," may possibly come from the Latin %0a" acies" — " edge," as Beckmann has suggested. %0a%0a58 Situate at the spot now known as " Bambola," near Calatayud.

THE METAL CALLED LIVE IKON. %0a%0aWe shall speak of the loadstone in its proper place, 67 and of %0athe sympathy which it has with iron. This is the only metal %0athat acquires the properties of that stone, retaining them for a %0alength of time, and attracting other iron, so that we may some- %0atimes see a whole chain formed of these rings. The lower %0aclasses, in their ignorance, call this " live iron," and the wound3 %0athat are made by it are much more severe. This mineral is %0aalso found in Cantabria, not in continuous strata, like the %0agenuine loadstone, but in scattered fragments, which they call %0a" bullationes." 68 I do not know whether this species of ore is %0aproper also for the fusion of glass, 69 as no one has hitherto tried %0ait ; but it certainly imparts the same property as the magnet %0ato iron. The architect Timochares 70 began to erect a vaulted roof %0aof loadstone, in the Temple of Arsinoe, 71 at Alexandria, in order %0athat the iron statue of that princess might have the appear- %0aance of hanging suspended in the air : 72 his death, however, %0aand that of King Ptolemseus, who had ordered this monument %0ato be erected in honour of his sister, prevented the completion %0aof the project. %0a%0aCHAT. 43.

There %0aare two kinds of it, the black and the white. 66 The white is %0athe most valuable : it was called by the Greeks " cassiteros," 87 %0aand there is a fabulous story told of their going in quest of %0ait to the islands of the Atlantic, and of its being brought in %0abarks made of osiers, covered with hides. 88 It is now known %0athat it is a production of Lusitania and Gallaecia. 89 It is a %0asand found on the surface of the earth, and of a black colour, %0aand is only to be detected by its weight. It is mingled with %0asmall pebbles, particularly in the dried beds of rivers. The %0aminers wash this sand, and calcine the deposit in the furnace. %0aIt is also found in the gold mines that are known as "alutiae," 69 * %0a%0a54 From the Greek vypov wXaarpov . — B. 65 See B. xxxv. c. 57. — B. %0a%0a86 It is most probable that the " black lead" of Pliny was our lead, and %0athe "white lead" our tin.

Small boats, corresponding to the %0adescription here given, were very lately still in use among the inhabitants %0aof some parts of the south-west coast of England [and on the Severn]. %0aPliny has already spoken of these boats in B. vii. c. 57. — B.

Hence it is that they remain with %0athe gold in the baskets in which it is collected ; and being %0aseparated in the furnace, are then melted, and become con- %0averted into white lead. 91 %0a%0aBlack lead is not procured in Gallaecia, although it is so %0agreatly abundant in the neighbouring province of Cantabria ; %0anor is silver procured from white lead, although it is from %0ablack. 92 Pieces of black lead cannot be soldered without the %0aintervention of white lead, nor can this be done without em- %0aploying oil ; 93 nor can white lead, on the other hand, be united %0awithout the aid of black lead. White lead was held in esti- %0amation in the days even of the Trojan War, a fact that is at- %0atested by Homer, who calls it " cassiteros." 91 There are two %0adifferent sources of black lead : it being procured either from %0aits own native ore, where it is produced without the intermix- %0ature of any other substance, or else from an ore which con- %0atains it in common with silver, the two metals being fused to- %0agether. The metal which first becomes liquid in the furnace, %0ais called " stannum ;" 95 the next that melts is silver; and the %0ametal that remains behind is galena, 95 * the third constituent %0apart of the mineral. On this last being again submitted to %0afusion black lead is produced, with a deduction of two-ninths. %0a%0a90 Tin ore is among the heaviest of minerals, though the specific gravity %0aof the metal is small.

As already mentioned, 91 the finest %0amirrors were formerly prepared from it at Brundisium, until %0aeverybody, our maid-servants even, began to use silver ones. %0aAt the present day a counterfeit stannum is made, by adding %0aone-third of white copper to two-thirds of white lead. 98 It %0ais also counterfeited in another way, by mixing together equal %0aparts of white lead and black lead ; this last being what is %0acalled " argentarium." 99 There is also a composition called %0a" tertiarium," a mixture of two parts of black lead and one of %0awhite : its price is twenty denarii per pound, and it is used %0afor soldering pipes. Persons still more dishonest mix together 1 %0aequal parts of tertiarium and white lead, and, calling the com- %0apound "argentarium," coat articles with it melted. This last %0asells at sixty denarii per ten pounds, the price of the pure un- %0amixed white lead being eighty denarii, and of the black seven. 2 %0a%0aWhite lead is naturally more dry ; while the black, on the %0acontrary, is always moist; consequently the white, without %0abeing mixed with another metal, is of no use* for anything. %0aSilver too, cannot be soldered with it, because the silver be- %0acomes fused before the white lead. It is confidently stated, %0aalso, that if too 6mall a proportion of black lead is mixed with %0a%0a98 A compound metal, probably, somewhat like pewter. See Note 95 %0aabove.

How then could the workmen merit the title of dishonest ? Beck- %0amann suggests that the tinning ought to have been done with pure tin, but %0athat unprincipled artists employed tin mixed with lead. It is most %0aprobable, however, that Pliny himself has made a mistake, and that we %0ashould read " equal parts of black lead" (our lead) ; in which case the %0amixture passed off as "argentarium," instead of containing equal parts of %0atin and lead, would contain five-sixths of lead.

It was in the %0aGallic provinces that the method was discovered of coaling %0aarticles of copper with while lead, so as to be scarcely distin- %0aguishable from silver : articles thus plated are known as %0a" incoctilia." 4 At a later period, the people of the town of %0aAlesia 5 began to use a similar process for plating articles with %0asilver, more particularly ornaments for horses, beasts of burden, %0aand yokes of oxen : the merit, however, of this invention %0abelongs to the Bituriges. 6 After this, they began to ornament %0atheir esseda, colisata, and petorita 7 in a similar manner ; aud %0aluxury has at last arrived at such a pitch, that not only are %0atheir decorations made of silver, but of gold even, and what %0awas formerly a marvel to behold on a cup, is now subjected to %0athe wear and tear of a carriage, and this in obedience to %0awhat they call fashion ! %0a%0aWhite lead is tested, by pouring it, melted, 8 upon paper, %0awhich ought to have the appearance of being torn rather by %0athe weight than by the heat of the metal. India has neither %0acopper nor lead, 9 but she procures them in exchange for her %0aprecious stones and pearls. %0a%0aCHAP. 49.

It is a marvellous fact, that these mines, and these only, %0awhen they have been abandoned for some time, become re- %0aplenished, and are more prolific than before. This would %0aappear to be effected by the air, infusing itself at liberty %0athrough the open orifices, just as some women become more %0aprolific after abortion. This was lately found to be the case %0awith the Santarensian mine in Baetica; 13 which, after being %0afarmed at an annual rental of two hundred thousand denarii, %0aand then abandoned, is now rented at two hundred and fifty- %0afive thousand per annum. In the same manner, the Antonian %0amine in the same province has had the rent raised to four %0ahundred thousand sesterces per annum. %0a%0aIt is a remarkable fact, that if we pour water into a vessel %0aof lead, it will not melt; but that if we throw into the water %0aa pebble or a copper quadrans, 14 the vessel will be penetrated %0aby the fire. %0a%0aCHAP. 50.

Indeed, the vapours from all %0ametals destroy flies and gnats ; and hence it is that in mines %0athere are none of those annoyances. 16 Some persons, during the %0aprocess, mix lead-filings with the sulphur, while others substi- %0atute ceruse for sulphur. By washing, a preparation is made %0afrom lead, that is much employed in medicine : for this pur- %0apose, a leaden mortar, containing rain water, is beaten with a %0apestle of lead, until the water has assumed a thick consistency ; %0awhich done, the water that floats on the surface is removed %0awith a sponge, and the thicker part of the sediment is left to %0adry, and is then divided into tablets. Some persons triturate %0alead-filings in this way, and some mix with it lead ore, or %0aelse vinegar, wine, grease, or rose-leaves. Others, again, %0aprefer triturating the lead in a stone mortar, one of Thebaic %0astone more particularly, with a pestle of lead; by which %0aprocess a whiter preparation is obtained. %0a%0aAs to calcined lead, it is washed, like stibi 17 and cadmia. %0aIts action is astringent and repressive, and it is promotive of %0acicatrization. The same substance is also employed in prepa- %0arations for the eyes, cases of procidence 18 of those organs more %0aparticularly ; also for filling up the cavities left by ulcers, and %0afor removing excrescences and fissures of the anus, as well as %0ahsemorrhoidal and condylomatous tumours. For all these pur- %0aposes the lotion of lead is particularly useful ; but for serpigi- %0anous or sordid ulcers it is the ashes of calcined lead that are %0aused, these producing the same advantageous effects as ashes of %0aburnt papyrus. 19 %0a%0aThe lead is calcined in thin plates, laid with sulphur in %0ashallow vessels, the mixture being stirred with iron rods or %0astalks of fennel-giant, until the melted metal becomes calcined ; %0awhen cold, it is pulverized. Some persons calcine lead- %0afilings in a vessel of raw earth, which they leave in the %0afurnace, until the earthenware is completely baked. Others, %0aagain, mix with it an equal quantity of ceruse or of barley, and %0atriturate it in the way mentioned for raw lead ; indeed, the %0a%0a16 Hardouin observes, that these insects are never met with in mines ; %0ahut probably this may depend more upon other causes, than upon the %0avapours which are supposed to proceed from the metals. — B. %0a%0a" See B. xxxiii. cc. 33, 34. 18 See B. xx. c. 81, and B. xxiv. c. 73. %0a%0a19 "Charta."

THE OEES OF BRASS. 1 %0a%3c %0a%3c We must, in the next place, give an account of the ores of %0a%3c brass, 2 a metal which, in respect of utility, is next in value ; %0a%3c indeed the Corinthian brass comes before silver, not to say %0a%3c almost before gold itself. It is also, as I have stated above, 3 %0a%3c the standard of monetary value ; 4 hence the terms " sera mili- %0a%3c tum," " tribuni aerarii," " aerarium," " obaerati," and " aere %0a%3c diruti." 5 I have already mentioned for what length of time %0a%3c the Roman people employed no coin except brass ; 6 and there is %0a%3c %0a%3c 1 The present Book is translated by the late Dr. Bostock, the translation %0a%3c being corrected by the readings of the Bamberg MS., which do not appear %0a%3c to have come under his notice. Some Notes by Dr. Bostock will be also %0a%3c found at the commencement of Books 33 and 35 ; they are distinguished %0a%3c by the initial B. %0a%3c %0a%3c • " JSris Metalla." The word " iEs " does not entirely correspond to %0a%3c our word " brass •," the brass of the moderns being a compound of copper %0a%3c and zinc, while the "iEs" of the ancients was mostly composed of copper %0a%3c and tin, and therefore, would be more correctly designated by the word %0a%3c " bronze." But this last term is now so generally appropriated to works of %0a%3c art, that it would seem preferable to employ in most cases the more general %0a%3c terms " copper" or " brass." For an excellent account of the " iEs" of the %0a%3c ancients, see Smith's Diet. Antiq. "iEs."— B. Mr. "Westmacott, in the %0a%3c above-mentioned article, says that the ancient "iEs" has been found, %0a%3c upon analysis, to contain no zinc, but in nearly every instance to be a mix- %0a%3c ture of copper and tin, like our bronze. Beckmann says, on the other %0a%3c hand, that the mixture of zinc and copper now called "brass," first dis- %0a%3c covered by ores, abundant in zinc, was certainly known to the ancients. %0a%3c "In the course of time, an ore, which mast have been calamine, was added %0a%3c to copper while melting, to give it a yellow colour." Hist. Inv. Vol. II. %0a%3c pp. 32, 33. Bohn's Edition. There can be little doubt that the native %0a%3c Cadmia of Chapter 22 of this Book was our Calamine, hydrosilicate of %0a%3c zinc, or carbonate of zinc, or else copper ore impregnated with calamine. %0a%3c %0a%3c 3 In B. xxxiii. c. 13. %0a%3c %0a%3c 4 " Stipis auctoritas."

The metal is also %0a%3c obtained from a coppery stone called "cadmia." 9 The most %0a%3c highly esteemed copper is procured from beyond seas : it was %0a%3c formerly obtained in Campania also, and at present is found in %0a%3c the country of the Bergomates, 10 at the extremity of Italy. %0a%3c It is said to have been lately discovered also in the province of %0a%3c Germany. %0a%3c %0a%3c (2.) In Cyprus, where copper was first discovered, it is also pro- %0a%3c cured from another stone, which is called " chalcitis." 11 This, %0a%3c however, was afterwards considered of little value, a better %0a%3c kind having been found in other regions, especially that called %0a%3c "aurichalcum," 12 which was long in high request, onaccouutof %0a%3c %0a%3c I " Collegium."

We have no %0a%3c means of ascertaining, with certainty, what is the substance to which this %0a%3c name was applied by the ancients. The ores of copper are very nume- %0a%3c rous, and of various chemical constitutions: the most abundant, and those %0a%3c most commonly employed in the production of the pure metal, are the %0a%3c sulphurets. more especially what is termed copper pyrites, and the oxides. %0a%3c It has been supposed, by some commentators, that the Cadmia of the an- %0a%3c cients was Calamine, which is an ore of zinc ; but we may be confident %0a%3c that the j£s of the ancients could not be produced from this substance, %0a%3c because, as has been stated above, the JEs contains no zinc. I must, how- %0a%3c ever, observe that the contrary opinion is maintained by M. Delafosse. — B. %0a%3c See Note 2 above. %0a%3c %0a%3c 10 The inhabitants of Bergamum, the modern Bergamo.— B.

See further %0a%3c as to " Chalcitis," in Chapter 29 of this Book. %0a%3c %0a%3c 12 There has been much discussion respecting the nature of this sub- %0a%3c stance, and the derivation of the word. Hardouin conceives it probable %0a%3c that it was originally written " orichalcuni," i.e. "mountain brass" or %0a%3c " copper."— B. Ajasson considers it to be native brass, a mixture of copper %0a%3c and zinc. In the later writers it signifies artificial brass. The exact com- %0a%3c position of this metal is still unknown, but there is little doubt that Har- %0a%3c douin is right in his supposition as to the origin of the name. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 3.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c THE CORINTHIAN BRASS. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 149 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c its excellent quality ; but none of it has been found for this %0a%3c long time, the earth having been quite exhausted. The kind %0a%3c which was next in value was the Sallustian, 13 procured from %0a%3c the Alpine district of the Centrones ; u but this did not last %0a%3c long, and was succeeded by the Livian, in Gaul. They both %0a%3c took their names from the owners of the mines ; the former a %0a%3c friend of the Emperor Augustus, the latter that emperor's %0a%3c wife. 10 They soon failed, however, and in the Livian even %0a%3c there is now found but a very small quantity of ore. That %0a%3c which is at present held in the highest estimation is the %0a%3c Marian, likewise known as the Corduban : 16 next to the Livian, %0a%3c this kind most readily absorbs cadmia, and becomes almost as %0a%3c excellent as aurichalcum 17 for making sesterces and double %0a%3c asses, 18 the Cyprian copper being thought good enough for the %0a%3c as.

THE CORINTHIAN BRASS. %0a%3c %0a%3c The other kinds are made artificially, all of which will be %0a%3c described in the appropriate places, the more celebrated kinds %0a%3c first coming under our notice. Formerly a mixture was made %0a%3c of copper fused with gold and silver, and the workmanship in %0a%3c this metal was considered even more valuable than the ma- %0a%3c terial itself; but, at the present day, it is difficult to say %0a%3c whether the workmanship in it, or the material, is the worst. %0a%3c Indeed, it is wonderful, that while the value of these works' 9 %0a%3c %0a%3c 13 Possibly so called from Sallustius Crispus, the historian, who was one %0a%3c of the secretaries of Augustus. %0a%3c %0a%3c u There is some doubt respecting the locality of these people ; they are %0a%3c enumerated hy Pliny among the inhabitants of the mountainous districts of %0a%3c Savoy, B. iii. c. 24, and are referred to by Ptolemy.— B. %0a%3c %0a%3c 15 Livia. %0a%3c %0a%3c '-- It was named " Marian," after the celebrated Marius, and " Cordu- %0a%3c ban," from the place whence it was procured ; probably the mountains near %0a%3c Coiduba, in Spain, well known as the birth-place of the two Senecas and %0a%3c of Lucan. — B.

[Book XXXIV. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c has so infinitely increased, the reputation of the art itself 20 is %0a%3c nearly extinct. But it would appear, that in this, as in every- %0a%3c thing else, what was formerly done for the sake of reputation, %0a%3c is now undertaken for the mere purpose of gain. For %0a%3c whereas this art was ascribed to the gods 21 themselves, and %0a%3c men of rank in all countries endeavoured to acquire fame by %0a%3c the practice of it, we have now so entirely lost the method of %0a%3c making this valuable compound by fusion, that, for this long %0a%3c time past, not even chance itself has assumed, in this depart- %0a%3c ment, the privilege which formerly belonged to art. 22 %0a%3c %0a%3c Xext after the above compound, so celebrated in antiquity, %0a%3c the Corinthian metal has been the most highly esteemed. This %0a%3c was a compound produced by accident, when Corinth was burnt %0a%3c at the time of its capture. 23 There has been a wonderful mania %0a%3c with many for gaining possession of this metal. It is even said, %0a%3c that Yerres, whom M. Cicero caused to be condemned, was %0a%3c proscribed by Antonius, along with Cicero, for no other reason %0a%3c than his refusal to give up some specimens of Corinthian metal, %0a%3c which were in his possession. But most of these people seem %0a%3c to me to make a pretence of their discernment in reference to %0a%3c this metal, rather for the purpose of distinguishing themselves %0a%3c from the multitude, than from any real knowledge which they %0a%3c possess ; and this I will briefly show. %0a%3c %0a%3c Corinth was captured in the third year of the 158th %0a%3c Olympiad, being the j-ear of the City, 608, 24 some ages after the %0a%3c period when those artists flourished, who produced all the %0a%3c specimens of what these persons now call Corinthian metal. %0a%3c Jt is in order, therefore, to refute this opinion, that I shall %0a%3c Btate the age when these different artists lived ; for, if we %0a%3c reckon according to the above-mentioned era of the Olympiads, %0a%3c it will be easy to compare their dates with the corresponding %0a%3c years of our City.

Although this ac- %0a%3c count was generally received by the ancients, we may venture to assert, %0a%3c that it cannot be correct; we cannot conceive the possibility of such a %0a%3c fusion taking place during the destruction of the city, or of the complete %0a%3c union of the components, in the mode in which they have been found to %0a%3c exist— B, 3 » b.c. 146. — B. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 5.1 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c THE JEGINETAN BRASS. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 151 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c are those -which these men of taste metamorphose, sometimes %0a%3c into dishes, sometimes into lamps, or even into washing- %0a%3c basins, 25 without any regard to decency. They are of three %0a%3c kinds; the white variety, approaching very nearly to the %0a%3c splendour of silver, and in which that metal forms a large %0a%3c proportion of the compound; a second kind, in which the %0a%3c yellow colour of gold predominates ; and a third, in which all %0a%3c the metals are mixed in equal proportions. Besides these, %0a%3c there is another mixture, the composition of which it is im- %0a%3c possible to describe, for although it has been formed into %0a%3c images and statues by the hand of man, it is chance that rules %0a%3c in the formation of the compound. This last is highly prized %0a%3c for its colour, which approaches to that of liver, and it is %0a%3c on this account that it is called " hepatizon :" 26 it is far in- %0a%3c ferior to the Corinthian metal, but much superior to the %0a%3c ^ginetan and Delian, which long held the first rank. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP 4. — THE BELIAN BRASS. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Delian brass was the first 27 that became famous, all the %0a%3c world coming to Delos to purchase it; and hence the attention %0a%3c paid to the manufacture of it. It was in this island that %0a%3c brass first obtained celebrity for the manufacture of the feet %0a%3c and supports of dining- couches. After some time it came %0a%3c to be employed for the statues of the gods, and the effigies of %0a%3c men and other animated beings. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 5. — THE JEGINETAN BRASS. %0a%3c %0a%3c The next most esteemed brass was the JEginetan ; the %0a%3c island itself being rendered famous for its brass — not indeed %0a%3c that the metal was produced there, but because the annealing %0a%3c of the vEginetan manufactories was so excellent. A brazen %0a%3c Ox, which was taken from this island, now stands in the %0a%3c Forum JJcarinnr 8 at Eome. This is a specimen of the %0a%3c JEginetan metal, as the Jupiter in the Temple of Jupiter %0a%3c %0a%3c 25 "Trulleos." In an epigram of Martial, B. ix.

(3.) — STANDS FOR LAMPS. %0a%3c %0a%3c iEgina was particularly famous for the manufacture of %0a%3c sockets only for lamp-stands, as Tarentum was for that of the %0a%3c branches ; 31 the most complete articles were, therefore, pro- %0a%3c duced by the union of the two. There are persons, too, who %0a%3c are not ashamed to give for one a sum equal to the salary of %0a%3c a military tribune, 3 - although, as its name indicates, its only %0a%3c use is to hold a lighted candle. On the sale of one of these %0a%3c lamp-stands, Theon the public crier announced, that the pur- %0a%3c chaser must also take, as part of the lot, one Clesippus, a %0a%3c fuller, who was hump-backed, and in other respects, of a %0a%3c hideous aspect. The purchase was made by a female named 33 %0a%3c Gegania, for fifty thousand sesterces. Upon her exhibiting %0a%3c these purchases at an entertainment which she gave, the %0a%3c slave, for the amusement of her guests, was brought in naked. %0a%3c Conceiving an infamous passion for him, she first admitted %0a%3c him to her bed, and finally left him all her estate. Having %0a%3c thus become excessively rich, he adored the lamp-stand as %0a%3c much as any divinity, and the story became a sort of pendant %0a%3c to the celebrity of the Corinthian lamp-stands. Still, how- %0a%3c ever, good morals were vindicated in the end, for he erected a %0a%3c splendid monument to her memory, and so kept alive the eternal %0a%3c remembrance of the misconduct of Gegania. But although %0a%3c it is well known that there are no lamp-stands in existence %0a%3c made of the Corinthian metal, yet this name is very generally %0a%3c attached to them, because, in consequence of the victory of %0a%3c %0a%3c 29 A distinguished statuary and engraver on silver.

THE ORIGIN OF STATUES, AND THE RESPECT %0a%3c PAID TO THEM. %0a%3c %0a%3c But after some time the artists everywhere applied them- %0a%3c selves to representations of the gods. I find that the first %0a%3c brass image, which was made at Rome, was that of Ceres ; %0a%3c and that the expenses were defrayed out of the property that %0a%3c belonged to Spurius Cassius, who was put to death by his own %0a%3c father, for aspiring to the regal office. 46 The practice, how- %0a%3c ever, soon passed from the gods to the statues and representa- %0a%3c tions of men, and this in various forms. The ancients stained %0a%3c their statues with bitumen, which makes it the more remark- %0a%3c able that they were afterwards fond of covering them with %0a%3c gold. I do not know whether this was a Roman invention ; %0a%3c but it certainly has the repute of being an ancient practice at %0a%3c Rome. %0a%3c %0a%3c It was not the custom in former times to give the likeness %0a%3c of individuals, except of such as deserved to be held in lasting %0a%3c remembrance on account of some illustrious deed ; in the first %0a%3c instance, for a victory at the sacred games, and more particularly %0a%3c the Olympic Games, where it was the usage for the victors %0a%3c always to have their statues consecrated.

After some %0a%3c time, a kind of forum or public place came to be made in pri- %0a%3c vate houses and in our halls, the clients adopting this method %0a%3c of doing honour to their patrons. %0a%3c %0a%3c CDAP. 10.

The %0a%3c Greek practice is, not to cover any part of the body ; while, %0a%3c on the contrary, the Roman and the military statues have the %0a%3c addition of a cuirass.

Fulcinus, near the liostra, all of whom were assas- %0a%3c sinated by the Fidenates, when on their mission as ambassa- %0a%3c dors. 71 It was the custom with the republic to confer this %0a%3c honour on those who had been unjustly put to death ; such as P. %0a%3c Junius, also, and Titus Coruncanius, who were slain by Teuta, %0a%3c queen of the Illyrians. 72 It would be wrong not to mention %0a%3c what is stated in the Annals, that their statues, erected in %0a%3c the Forum, were three feet in height ; whence it would appear %0a%3c that such were the dimensions of these marks of honour in %0a%3c those times. %0a%3c %0a%3c Nor must I forget to mention Cneius Octavius, on account of %0a%3c the language used by the senate. 73 When King Antiochus %0a%3c said, that he would give him an answer at another time, Oc- %0a%3c tavius drew a line round him with a stick, which he happened %0a%3c to have in his hand, and compelled him to give an answer %0a%3c before he allowed him to step beyond the circle.

IN HONOUR OF WHAT FOREIGNERS PUBLIC STATUES %0a%3c %0a%3c WERE ERECTED AT ROME. %0a%3c %0a%3c I find also, that statues were erected in honour of Pytha- %0a%3c goras and of Alcibiades, in the corners of the Comitium ; in obe- %0a%3c dience to the command of the Pythian Apollo, who, in the %0a%3c Samnite War, 77 had directed that statues of the bravest and %0a%3c the wisest of the Greeks should be erected in some conspicu- %0a%3c ous spot : and here they remained until Sylla, the Dictator, %0a%3c built the senate-house on the site. It is wonderful that the %0a%3c senate should then have preferred Pythagoras to Socrates, who, %0a%3c in consequence of his wisdom, had been preferred to all other %0a%3c men 78 by the god himself ; as, also, that they should have pre- %0a%3c ferred Alcibiades for valour to so many other heroes ; or, indeed, %0a%3c any one to Themistocles, who so greatly excelled in both quali- %0a%3c ties. The reason of the statues being raised on columns, was, %0a%3c that the persons represented might be elevated above other %0a%3c mortals ; the same thing being signified by the use of arches, %0a%3c a new invention which had its origin among the Greeks. I %0a%3c am of opinion that there is no one' to whom more statues were %0a%3c erected than to Demetrius Phalereus 79 at Athens : for there %0a%3c were three hundred and sixty erected in his honour, there %0a%3c being reckoned at that period no more days in the year : these, %0a%3c however, were soon broken to pieces.

JElius, the tribune of the people, %0a%3c who had introduced a law against Sthennius Statilius Lu- %0a%3c canus, 88 for having twice attacked Thurii : on which account %0a%3c the inhabitants of that place presented JElius with a statue %0a%3c and a golden crown. At a later period, the same people %0a%3c erected a statue to Fabricius, 89 who had delivered their city %0a%3c from a state of siege. From time to time various nations %0a%3c thus placed themselves under the protection of the Romans ; %0a%3c and all distinctions were thereby so effectually removed, that %0a%3c statues of Hannibal even are to be seen in three different %0a%3c places in that city, within the walls of which, he alone of all %0a%3c its enemies, had hurled his spear. 90 %0a%3c %0a%3c 86 See Chapter 9. %0a%3c %0a%3c 87 " In Octaviae operibus."

(7.) — THAT TIT F.HE STATU A HIES IN ITALY ALSO %0a%3c %0a%3c AT AN EARLY PERIOD. %0a%3c %0a%3c Various circumstances prove, that the art of making statues %0a%3c was commonly practised in Italy at an early period. The %0a%3c statue in the Cattle Market 91 is said to have heen consecrated %0a%3c to Hercules by Evander ; it is called the triumphal Hercules, %0a%3c and, on the occasion of triumphal processions, is arrayed in %0a%3c triumphal vestments. And then besides, King Nuraa dedi- %0a%3c cated the statue of the two-faced Janus; 93 a deity who is %0a%3c worshipped as presiding over both peace and war. The %0a%3c fingers, too, are so formed as to indicate three hundred and %0a%3c sixty-five days, 93 or in other words, the year ; thus denoting %0a%3c that he is the god of time and duration. %0a%3c %0a%3c There are also Etruscan statues dispersed in various parts %0a%3c of the world, which beyond a doubt were originally made in %0a%3c Etruria. I should have supposed that these had been the %0a%3c statues only of divinities, had not Metrodorus 91 of Scepsis, who %0a%3c had his surname from his hatred to the Roman name, 94 re- %0a%3c proached us with having pillaged the city of Volsinii for the %0a%3c sake of the two thousand statues which it contained. It %0a%3c appears to me a singular fact, that although the origin of %0a%3c statues was of such great antiquity in Italy, the images of the %0a%3c gods, which were consecrated to them in their temples, should %0a%3c have been formed either of wood or of earthenware, 98 until %0a%3c the conquest of Asia, which introduced luxury among us. It %0a%3c will be the best plan to enlarge upon the origin of the art of %0a%3c expressing likenesses, when we come to speak of what the %0a%3c %0a%3c 91 " Forum Boari urn."

"We are informed %0a%3c that some MSS. of Pliny give the number three hundred and fifty-five onlv, %0a%3c and there is reason to believe that, in the time of Numa, this was considered %0a%3c to be the actunl number of days in the year. Some of the commentators, %0a%3c however, are disposed to read three hundred and sixty-five ; and this opinion %0a%3c derives some support from Macrobius, who refers to this statue as indicating %0a%3c this latter number with its fingers. — B.

THE IMMODERATE PRICES OF STATTES. %0a%3c %0a%3c In the aedileship of M. Scaurus, there were three thousand %0a%3c statues erected on the stage of what was a temporary theatre 97 %0a%3c only. Mummius, the conqueror of Achaia, filled the City %0a%3c with statues ; he who at his death was destined not to leave a %0a%3c dowry to his daughter, 98 for why not mention this as an %0a%3c apology for him ? The Luculli" also introduced many ar- %0a%3c ticles from abroad. Yet we learn from Mucianus, 1 who was %0a%3c thrice consul, that there are still three thousand statues in %0a%3c Rhodes, and it is supposed that there are no fewer in ex- %0a%3c istence at Athens, at Olympia, and at Delphi. What living %0a%3c mortal could enumerate them all? or of what utility would %0a%3c be such information ? Still, however, I may, perhaps, afford %0a%3c amusement by giving some slight account of such of those works %0a%3c of art as are in any way remarkable, and stating the names of %0a%3c the more celebrated artists. Of each of these it would be %0a%3c impossible to enumerate all the productions, for Lysippus 2 %0a%3c alone is said to have executed no less than fifteen hundred 2 * %0a%3c works of art, all of which were of such excellence that any %0a%3c one of them might have immortalized him.

As a proof of successful, %0a%3c ness, I will adduce one example, and that of a figure which %0a%3c represented neither god nor man. We have seen in our own %0a%3c time, in the Capitol, before it was last burnt by the party 4 of %0a%3c Vitellius, in the shrine of Juno there, a bronze figure of a dog %0a%3c licking its wounds. Its miraculous excellence and its perfect %0a%3c truthfulness were not only proved by the circumstance of its %0a%3c having been consecrated there, but also by the novel kind of %0a%3c security that was taken for its safety ; for, no sum appearing %0a%3c equal to its value, it was publicly enacted that the keepers of %0a%3c it should be answerable for its safety with their lives. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 18. — THE MOST CELEBRATED COLOSSAL STATUES IN THE %0a%3c CITY. %0a%3c %0a%3c As to boldness of design, the examples are innumerable; %0a%3c for we see designed, statues of enormous bulk, known as %0a%3c colossal statues and equal to towers in size. Such, for %0a%3c instance, is the Apollo in the Capitol, which was brought by %0a%3c M. Lucullus from Apollonia, a city of Pontus, 5 thirty cubits %0a%3c in height, and which cost five hundred talents : such, too, is %0a%3c the statue of Jupiter, in the Campus Martius, dedicated by %0a%3c the late Emperor Claudius, but which appears small in com- %0a%3c parison from its vicinity to the Theatre of Pompeius : and such %0a%3c is that at Tarentum, forty cubits in height, and the work of %0a%3c Lysippus. 6 It is a remarkable circumstance in this statue, %0a%3c that though, as it is stated, it is so nicely balanced as to be %0a%3c moveable by the hand, it has never been thrown down by a %0a%3c tempest. This indeed, the artist, it is said, has guarded %0a%3c against, by a column erected at a short distance from it, %0a%3c upon the side on which the violence of the wind required %0a%3c to be broken. On account, therefore, of its magnitude, and %0a%3c the great difficulty of moving it, Fabius Verrucosus 7 did not %0a%3c %0a%3c 3 " Aureum."

This statue, fifty- six years after it was erected, was %0a%3c thrown down by an earthquake ; but even as it lies, it excites %0a%3c our wonder and admiration.' Few men can clasp the thumb %0a%3c in their arms, and its fingers are larger than most statues. %0a%3c Where the limbs are broken asunder, vast caverns are seen %0a%3c yawning in the interior. Within it, too, are to be seen large %0a%3c masses of rock, by the weight of which the artist steadied it %0a%3c while erecting it. It is said that it was twelve years before %0a%3c this statue was completed, and that three hundred talents were %0a%3c expended upon it ; a sum raised from the engines of warfare %0a%3c which had been abandoned by King Demetrius, 10 when tired %0a%3c of the long-protracted siege of Rhodes. In the same city %0a%3c there are other colossal 6tatues, one hundred in number ; but %0a%3c though smaller than the one already mentioned, wherever %0a%3c erected, they would, any one of them, have ennobled the place. %0a%3c In addition to these, there are five colossal statues of the gods, %0a%3c which were made by Bryaxis. 11 %0a%3c %0a%3c Colossal statues used also to be made in Italy. At all events, %0a%3c we see the Tuscan Apollo, in the library of the Temple of %0a%3c Augustus, 12 fifty feet in height from the toe ; and it is a question %0a%3c whether it is more remarkable for the quality of the metal, or %0a%3c for the beauty of the workmanship. Spurius Carvilius also %0a%3c erected the statue of Jupiter which is seen in the Capitol, after he %0a%3c %0a%3c 8 The Colossus of Rhodes was hegun hy Chares, but he committed %0a%3c suicide, in consequence of having made some mistake in the estimate ; the %0a%3c work was completed by Laches, also an inhabitant of Lindos. — B. %0a%3c %0a%3c 9 It remained on the spot where it was thrown down for nearly nine %0a%3c hundred years, until the year 653 a.d., when Moavia, khalif of the %0a%3c Saracens, after the capture of Rhodes, sold the materials ; it is said that %0a%3c it required nine hundred camels to remove the remains. — B. %0a%3c %0a%3c 10 Demetrius Poliorcetes.

There are also, in the Capitol, two heads %0a%3c which are very much admired, and which were dedicated by %0a%3c the Consul P. Lentulus, one of them executed by the above- %0a%3c mentioned Chares, 16 the other by Decius; 16 but this last is so %0a%3c greatly excelled by the former, as to have all the appearance of %0a%3c being the work of one of the poorest of artists. %0a%3c %0a%3c But all these gigantic statues of this kind have been sur- %0a%3c passed in our own age by that of Mercury, made by Zenodotus 16 * %0a%3c for the city of the Arverni in Gaul, 17 which was ten years in %0a%3c being completed, and the making of which cost four hun- %0a%3c dred thousand sesterces. Haviug given sufficient proof there %0a%3c of his artistic skill, he was sent for by Nero to Rome, where %0a%3c he made a colossal statue intended to represent that prince, %0a%3c one hundred and ten feet in height.

He flourished in the eighty-third %0a%3c Olympiad, about the year of our City, 300.

This last work of art, after his conquest of Mace- %0a%3c donia, 25 Metellus conveyed to Rome. Lysippus also executed %0a%3c chariots of various kinds. He is considered to have contri- %0a%3c buted very greatly to the art of statuary by expressing the %0a%3c details of the hair,- 6 and by making the head smaller than had %0a%3c been done by the ancients, and the body more graceful and less %0a%3c bulky, a method by which his statues were made to appear %0a%3c taller. The Latin language has no appropriate name for that %0a%3c " symmetry," 27 which he so attentively observed in his new and %0a%3c hitherto untried method of modifying the squareness obser- %0a%3c vable in the ancient statues. Indeed, it was a common saying %0a%3c of his, that other artists made men as they actually were, while %0a%3c he made them as they appeared to be. One peculiar character- %0a%3c istic of his work, is the finish and minuteness which are ob- %0a%3c served in even the smallest details. Lysippus left three sons, %0a%3c who were also his pupils, and became celebrated as artists, %0a%3c Laippus, Bcedas, and, more particularly, Euthycrates; though %0a%3c this last-named artist rivalled his father in precision rather %0a%3c than in elegance, and preferred scrupulous correctness to grace- %0a%3c fulness. Nothing can be more expressive than his Hercules %0a%3c at Delphi, his Alexander, his Hunter at Thespite, and his %0a%3c Equestrian Combat. Equally good, too, are his statue of Tro- %0a%3c phonius, erected in the oracular cave 28 of that divinity, his %0a%3c numerous chariots, his Horse with the Panniers, 29 and his hounds. %0a%3c %0a%3c Tisicrates, also a native of Sicyon, was a pupil of Euthy- %0a%3c crates, but more nearly approaching the style of Lysippus ; so %0a%3c much so, that several of his statues can scarcely be distinguished %0a%3c from those of Lysippus ; his aged Theban, for example, his King %0a%3c Demetrius, and his Peucestes, who saved the life of Alexander %0a%3c the Great, and so rendered himself deserving of this honour. 30 %0a%3c %0a%3c 24 A large group of equestrian statues, representing those of Alexan- %0a%3c der's body-guard, who had fallen at the battle of the Granicus. %0a%3c %0a%3c 25 a.u.c. 606. %0a%3c %0a%3c 26 See the Greek Anthology, B. iv.

They more particularly commend his Larissa, %0a%3c his Spintharus, the pentathlete, 31 and his Apollo. Others, %0a%3c however, assign another reason for his being so little known ; %0a%3c it being owing, they think, to his having devoted himself to %0a%3c the studios established by Kings Xerxes and Darius. %0a%3c %0a%3c Praxiteles, who excelled more particularly in marble, and %0a%3c thence acquired his chief celebrity, also executed some very %0a%3c beautiful works in brass, the Eape of Proserpine, the Catagusa, 32 %0a%3c a Father Liber, 33 a figure of Drunkenness, and the celebrated %0a%3c Satyr, 34 to the Greeks known as"Periboetos." 35 He also executed %0a%3c the statues, which were formerly before the Temple 36 of Good %0a%3c Fortune, and the Venus, which was destroyed by fire, with %0a%3c the Temple of that goddess, in the reign of Claudius, and was %0a%3c considered equal to his marble statue of Venus, 37 so celebrated %0a%3c throughout the world. He also executed a Stephanusa, 38 a Spi- %0a%3c lumene, 39 an GZnophorus, 40 and two figures of Harmodius and %0a%3c Aristogiton, who slew the tyrants; which last, having been taken %0a%3c away from Greece by Xerxes, were restored to the Athenians on %0a%3c %0a%3c as having occurred at the siege of the city of the Oxydracae; according to %0a%3c other historians, however, it is said to have taken place at a city of the %0a%3c Malli.— B. 31 See Note 1, above. %0a%3c %0a%3c 32 KaTttyovaa ; a figure of Ceres, probably, " leading back " Proserpine %0a%3c from the domains of Pluto.

This last-men- %0a%3c tioned artist has executed other chariots also, some with four %0a%3c horses, and some with two ; and in his horses he is always %0a%3c unrivalled.

Ep. 51, where he is pointing at the analogy between %0a%3c his poems and the works of the most eminent sculptors, probably refers to %0a%3c this statue : — %0a%3c %0a%3c "Nos facimus Bruti puerum, nos Lagona vivum." — B. %0a%3c The reading " Lagonem, " or "Langonem," certainly seems superior to %0a%3c that of the Bamberg MS. — "Mangonem," a "huckster." %0a%3c %0a%3c 96 For some further mention of him, see end of B. iv. %0a%3c %0a%3c 97 Delafosse has pointed out the resemblance between this 6tatue and one %0a%3c of the works of Michael Angelo, representing David kneeling on Goliath, %0a%3c and pressing back the giant's neck.— B. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 19.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c CELEBEATED WOEKS IN BEASS. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 183 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c vans has also written a treatise on his art. Naucydes 98 is %0a%3c admired for a Mercury, a Discobolus,' 9 and a Man sacrificing a %0a%3c Bam. Naucerus made a figure of a wrestler panting for %0a%3c breath ; Niceratus, an JEsculapius and Hygeia, 1 which are %0a%3c in the Temple of Concord at Home. Pyromachus represented %0a%3c Alcibiades, managing a chariot with four horses : Polycles %0a%3c made a splendid statue of Hermaphroditus ; Pyrrhus, statues of %0a%3c Hygeia and Minerva ; and Phanis, who was a pupil of Ly- %0a%3c sippus, an Epithyusa. 2 %0a%3c %0a%3c Stypax of Cyprus acquired his celebrity by a single work, %0a%3c the statue of the Splanchnoptes ; 3 which represents a slave of %0a%3c ttie Olympian Pericles, roasting entrails and kindling the fire %0a%3c with his breath. Silanion made a statue in metal of Apollo- %0a%3c dorus, who was himself a modeller, and not only the most %0a%3c diligent of all in the study of this art, but a most severe %0a%3c criticizer of his own works, frequently breaking his statues to %0a%3c pieces when he had finished them, and never able to s ttisfy %0a%3c his intense passion for the art — a circumstance which procured %0a%3c him the surname of "the Madman." Indeed, it is this ex- %0a%3c pression which he has given to his works, which represent in %0a%3c metal embodied anger rather than the lineaments of a human %0a%3c being. The Achilles, also, of Silanion is very excellent, and %0a%3c his Epistates 4 exercising the Athletes. Strongylion 5 made a %0a%3c figure of an Amazon, which, from the beauty of the legs, was %0a%3c known as the " Eucnemos," 6 and which Nero used to have carried %0a%3c about with him in his travels. Strongylion was the artist, %0a%3c %0a%3c 98 A native of Argos, who flourished in the 95th Olympiad. He was the %0a%3c son of Motho, and brother and instructor of the younger Polycletus of %0a%3c Argos. Several of his statues are mentioned by Pausanias and Tatian. %0a%3c %0a%3c 89 Ajasson thinks that three statues in the Royal Museum at Puns %0a%3c may possibly be copies of this Discobolus of Naucydes. %0a%3c %0a%3c 1 The Goddess of Health, and daughter of JSsculapius. Niceratus was %0a%3c a native of Athens, and is also mentioned by Tatian. %0a%3c %0a%3c 2 A " Female sacrificing." The reading is very doubtful. %0a%3c %0a%3c 3 The "Man cooking entrails." For some further account of this %0a%3c statue, see B. xxii. c. 20. This artist is unknown, but Thiersch suggests %0a%3c that he may have been the father of Cleomenes, whose name appears on %0a%3c the base of the Venus de Medicis. 4 The master of the Gymnasium. %0a%3c %0a%3c 5 He is twice mentioned by Pausanias : more particularly for the excel- %0a%3c lence of his horses and oxen.

Being always dissatisfied with him- %0a%3c self, and continually correcting his works, he obtained the name %0a%3c of " Catatexitechnos ;" 66 thus affording a memorable example %0a%3c of the necessity of observing moderation even in carefulness. %0a%3c His Baconian Female Dancers, for instance, is a most correct %0a%3c performance, but one in which, by extreme correctness, he has %0a%3c effaced all gracefulness. It has been said, too, that Calli- %0a%3c machus was a painter also. Cato, in his expedition against %0a%3c Cyprus, 67 sold all the statues that he found there, with the ex- %0a%3c ception of one of Zeno ; in which case he was influenced, neither %0a%3c by the value of the metal nor by its excellence as a work of %0a%3c art, but by the fact that it was the statue of a philosopher. I %0a%3c only mention this circumstance casually, that an example 69 %0a%3c so little followed, may be known. %0a%3c %0a%3c While speaking of statues, there is one other that should %0a%3c not be omitted, although its author is unknown, that of Her- %0a%3c %0a%3c " A native of Phocis, mentioned also by Vitnivius. %0a%3c %0a%3c 86 Also a Dithyrambic poet ; mentioned by Diodorus Siculus. %0a%3c %0a%3c 57 In B. xxxv. c. 36. %0a%3c %0a%3c 59 See B. xxxiii. c. 55. %0a%3c %0a%3c 60 Mentioned by Tatian as having made the statue of Eutychis.

PYBOPUS. CAMPANIAN COPPEB. %0a%3c %0a%3c We will now return to the different kinds of copper, and its %0a%3c several combinations. In Cyprian copper we have the kind %0a%3c known as " coronarium," 71 and that called "regulare," 71 * both %0a%3c of them ductile.

Among the other %0a%3c kinds of copper, the palm of excellence is awarded to that of %0a%3c Campania, 76 which is the most esteemed for vessels and utensils. %0a%3c This last is prepared several ways. At Capua it is melted %0a%3c upon fires made with wood, and not coals, after which it %0a%3c is sprinkled with cold water and cleansed through a 6ieve %0a%3c made of oak. After being thus smelted a number of times, %0a%3c Spanish silver-lead is added to it, in the proportion of ten %0a%3c pounds of lead to one hundred pounds of copper ; a method %0a%3c by which it is rendered pliable, and made to assume that agree- %0a%3c able colour which is imparted to other kinds of copper by the %0a%3c application of oil and the action of the sun. Many parts, %0a%3c however, of Italy, and the provinces, produce a similar kind %0a%3c of metal ; but there they add only eight pounds of lead, and, %0a%3c in consequence of the scarcity of wood, melt it several times %0a%3c over upon coals. It is in Gaul more particularly, where the %0a%3c ore is melted between red-hot stones, that the difference is to %0a%3c be seen that is produced by these variations in the method of %0a%3c smelting. Indeed, this last method scorches the metal, and %0a%3c renders it black and friable. Besides, they only melt it twice; %0a%3c whereas, the oftener this operation is repeated, the better in %0a%3c quality it becomes. %0a%3c %0a%3c (9.) It is also as well to remark that all copper fuses best %0a%3c when the weather is intensely cold. The proper combination %0a%3c for making statues and tablets is as follows : the ore is first %0a%3c melted ; after which there is added to the molten metal one %0a%3c third part of second-hand 77 copper, or in other words, copper %0a%3c that has been in use and bought up for the purpose. For it %0a%3c is a peculiarity of this metal that when it has been some time %0a%3c in use, and has been subject to long-continued friction, it be- %0a%3c comes seasoned, and subdued, as it were, to a high polish. %0a%3c Twelve pounds and a half of silver-lead are then added to %0a%3c every hundred pounds of the fused metal. There is also a %0a%3c combination of copper, of a most delicate nature, " mould- %0a%3c copper," 77 * as it is called ; there being added to the metal one %0a%3c %0a%3c 76 In the former Editions the whole of the next ten lines, from this word %0a%3c down to "sun" is omitted.

It is still used by the peasants of %0a%3c Silesia, Ajasson says. %0a%3c %0a%3c 83 It is obvious that the "cadmia" here described must be an essen- %0a%3c tially different substance from the M cadmia " mentioned in the second %0a%3c Chapter of this Book, that being a natural production, possibly calamine %0a%3c or hydrosilicate or carbonate of zinc ; while the "cadmia" of this Chapter %0a%3c is a furnace-calamine, a product of the fusion of the ore of copper, or %0a%3c zinc. — B. It is evident, too, that copper ores, impregnated with zinc or ca- %0a%3c lamine, also passed under this name. See Beckmann, Hist. Inv.

By the action of the flame and the blast, %0a%3c the more attenuated parts of the metal are separated, and %0a%3c become attached, in proportion to their lightness, to the %0a%3c arched top and sides of the furnace. These flakes are the %0a%3c thinnest near the exterior opening of the furnace, where the %0a%3c flame finds a vent, the substance being called " capnitis ;" M %0a%3c from its burnt appearance and its extreme lightness it re- %0a%3c sembles white ashes. The best is that which is found in the %0a%3c interior, hanging from the arches of the chimney, and from its %0a%3c form and position named " botryitis." b6 It is heavier than the %0a%3c first- mentioned kind, but lighter than those which follow. It %0a%3c is of two different colours : the least valuable is ash-coloured, %0a%3c the better kind being red, friable, and extremely useful as a %0a%3c remedy for affections of the eyes. %0a%3c %0a%3c A third kind of cadmia is that found on the sides of the %0a%3c furnace, and which, in consequence of its weight, could not %0a%3c reach the arched vaults of the chimney. This species is %0a%3c called " placitis," 67 in reference to its solid appearance, it pre- %0a%3c senting a plane surface more like a solid crust than pumice, %0a%3c and mottled -within. Its great use is, for the cure of itch- %0a%3c scab, and for making wounds cicatrize. Of this last there %0a%3c are two varieties, the "onychitis," which is almost en- %0a%3c tirely blue on the exterior, and spotted like an onyx within; %0a%3c and the " ostracitis," ss which is quite black and more dirty %0a%3c than the others, but particularly useful for healing wounds. %0a%3c All the species of cadmia are of the best quality from the %0a%3c furnaces of Cyprus.

Copper too, itself, when calcined, is employed for %0a%3c all these purposes ; in addition to which it is used for white %0a%3c spots and cicatrizations upon the eyes. Mixed with milk, it %0a%3c is curative also of ulcers upon the eyes ; for which purpose, %0a%3c the people in Egypt make a kind of eye-salve by grinding it %0a%3c upon whet stones.

These scales are %0a%3c also separated, when the cakes of metal are plunged into %0a%3c water: they become red, too, like the scales of copper known %0a%3c as "lepis," 97 by means of which the genuine flower of copper %0a%3c is adulterated, it being ako sold under that name. This last is %0a%3c made by hammering nails that are forged from the cakes of %0a%3c metal. All these processes are principally carried on in the %0a%3c furnaces of Cyprus ; the great difference between these sub- %0a%3c stances being, that this lepis is detached from the cakes by %0a%3c hammering, whereas the flower falls off spontaneously. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 25. — STOMOMA OF COPTER; FORTY-SEVEN REMEDIES. %0a%3c %0a%3c There is another finer kind of scale which is detached from %0a%3c the surface of the metal, like a very fine down, and known %0a%3c as " stomoma." 98 But of all these substances, and even of %0a%3c their names, the physicians, if I may venture so to say, are %0a%3c quite ignorant, as appears by the names they give them ; so %0a%3c %0a%3c 95 See B. xxxiii. c. 37. %0a%3c %0a%3c 96 " ^ris flos."

At the present day, whenever they %0a%3c happen to find a book of recipes, if they wish to make any %0a%3c composition from these substances, or, in other words, to make %0a%3c trial of the prescription at the expense of their unhappy %0a%3c patients, they trust entirely to the druggists, 1 who spoil %0a%3c everything by their fraudulent adulterations. For this long %0a%3c time past, they have even purchased their plasters and eye- %0a%3c salves ready made, and the consequence is, that the spoiled or %0a%3c adulterated wares in the druggists' shops are thus got rid of. %0a%3c %0a%3c Both lepis and flower of copper are calcined in shallow %0a%3c earthen or brazen pans; after which they are washed, as %0a%3c described above, 2 and employed for the same purposes ; in addi- %0a%3c tion to which, they are used for excrescences in the nostrils and %0a%3c in the anus, as also for dullness of the hearing, being forcibly %0a%3c blown into the ears through a tube. Incorporated with meal, %0a%3c they are applied to swellings of the uvula, and, with honey, to %0a%3c swellings of the tonsils. The scales prepared from white %0a%3c copper are much less efficacious than those from Cyprian %0a%3c copper. Sometimes they first macerate the nails and cakes of %0a%3c copper in a boy's urine ; and in some instances, they pound %0a%3c the scales, when detached, and wash them in rain water. %0a%3c They are then given to dropsical patients, in doses of two %0a%3c drachmae, with one semisextarius of honied wine : they are also %0a%3c made into a liniment with fine flour. %0a%3c %0a%3c chap. 26. — verdigris; eighteen remedies. %0a%3c %0a%3c Verdigris 3 is also applied to many purposes, and is prepared %0a%3c %0a%3c 99 Beckmann comments at some length, on this passage ; Vol. I. p. 328. %0a%3c Bohn's Edition. %0a%3c %0a%3c 1 " Seplasise."

Sometimes it is detached already formed, %0a%3c from the mineral from which copper is smelted : and some- %0a%3c times it is made by piercing holes in white copper, and sus- %0a%3c pending it over strong vinegar in casks, which are closed with %0a%3c covers ; it being much superior if scales of copper are used for %0a%3c the purpose. Some persons plunge vessels themselves, made %0a%3c of white copper, into earthen pots filled with vinegar, and %0a%3c scrape them at the end of ten days. Others, again, cover the %0a%3c vessels with husks of grapes, 4 and scrape them in the same %0a%3c way, at the end of ten days. Others sprinkle vinegar upon %0a%3c copper filings, and stir them frequently with a spatula in the %0a%3c course of the day, until they are completely dissolved. Others %0a%3c prefer triturating these filings with vinegar in a brazen %0a%3c mortar : but the most expeditious method of all is to add to %0a%3c the vinegar shavings of coronet copper. 4 Rhodian verdigris, %0a%3c more particularly, is adulterated with pounded marble ; some %0a%3c persons use pumice-stone or gum. %0a%3c %0a%3c The adulteration, however, which is the most difficult to %0a%3c detect, is made with copperas; 0 the other sophistications %0a%3c being detected by the crackling of the substance when bitten %0a%3c with the teeth. The best mode of testing it is by using an %0a%3c iron fire-shovel; for when thus subjected to the fire, if pure, %0a%3c the verdigris retains its colour, but if mixed with copperas, it %0a%3c becomes red. The fraud may also be detected by using a leaf %0a%3c of papyrus, which has been steeped in an infusion of nut-galls; %0a%3c for it becomes black immediately upon the genuine verdigris %0a%3c being applied. It may also be detected by the eye ; the green %0a%3c colour being unpleasant to the sight. But whether it is pure %0a%3c or adulterated, the best method is first to wash and dry it, and %0a%3c then to burn it in a new earthen vessel, turning it over until %0a%3c it is reduced to an ash ;' after which it is pounded and put by %0a%3c for use. Some persons calcine it in raw earthen vessels, until %0a%3c the earthenware becomes thoroughly baked : others again add %0a%3c to it male frankincense. 8 Verdigris is washed, too, in the same %0a%3c manner as cadmia. %0a%3c %0a%3c 4 According to Brotcro, this is the process generally adopted in France, %0a%3c in preference to the employment of vinegar in a pure state. — B. %0a%3c %0a%3c 5 The form of copper which was termed "coronarium" has been already %0a%3c described in Chapter 22. — B. %0a%3c %0a%3c 6 " Atramento sutorio."

CHALCITIS: SEVEN REMEDIES. %0a%3c %0a%3c Chalcitis 11 is the name of a mineral, from which, as well as %0a%3c cadmia, copper is extracted by heat. It differs from cadmia %0a%3c in this respect, that this last is procured from beds below the %0a%3c surface, while chalcitis is detached from rocks that are exposed %0a%3c to the air. Chalcitis also becomes immediately friable, being %0a%3c naturally so soft as to have the appearance of a compressed %0a%3c mass of down. There is also this other distinction between %0a%3c them, that chalcitis is a composition of three other substances, %0a%3c copper, misy, and sory, 15 of which last we shall speak in their %0a%3c appropriate places. 18 The veins of copper which it contains are %0a%3c oblong. The most approved kind is of the colour of honey ; %0a%3c it is streaked with fine sinuous veins, and is friable and not %0a%3c stony. It is generally thought to be most valuable when fresh, %0a%3c as, when old, it becomes converted into sory. It is highly %0a%3c useful for removing fleshy excrescences in ulcers, for arresting %0a%3c haemorrhage, and, in the form of a powder, for acting as- %0a%3c %0a%3c llour used in cookery."— Beckmann, Hist.

Misy %0a%3c is used in the process of refining gold. Mixed with oil of %0a%3c roses, it is used as an injection for suppurations of the ears, %0a%3c and, in combination with wool, it is applied to ulcers of the %0a%3c head.

It is prepared in Spain, %0a%3c from the water of wells or pits which contain it in dissolu- %0a%3c tion.

Upon being removed, %0a%3c it is dried for thirty days. It is of an azure colour, and of a %0a%3c brilliant lustre, and is often taken for glass. When dissolved, %0a%3c it forms the black dye that is used for colouring leather. %0a%3c %0a%3c Chalcanthum is also prepared in various other ways : the %0a%3c earth which contains it being sometimes excavated into %0a%3c trenches, from the sides of which globules exude, which %0a%3c become concrete when exposed to the action of the winter %0a%3c frosts. This kind is called " stalagmia," 28 and there is none %0a%3c more pure. When its colour is nearly white, with a slight %0a%3c tinge of violet, it is called "lonchoton." 29 It is also prepared %0a%3c in pans hollowed out in the rocks ; the rain water carrying tbe %0a%3c slime into them, where it settles and becomes hardened. It is %0a%3c also formed in the same way in which we prepare salt ; 30 the %0a%3c intense heat of the sun separating the fresh water from it. %0a%3c Hence it is that some distinguish two kinds of chalcanthum, %0a%3c the fossil and the artificial ; the latter being paler than the %0a%3c former, and as much inferior to it in quality as it is in %0a%3c colour. %0a%3c %0a%3c The chalcitis which comes from Cyprus is the most highly, %0a%3c esteemed for the purposes of medicine, being taken in doses of %0a%3c one drachma with honey, as an expellent of intestinal worms. %0a%3c Diluted and injected into the nostrils, it acts detergently %0a%3c upon the brain, and, taken with honey or with hydromel, it %0a%3c acts as a purgative upon the stomach. It removes granula- %0a%3c tions upon the eye-lids, and is good for pains and films upon %0a%3c the eyes ; it is curative also of ulcerations of the mouth. It %0a%3c arrests bleeding at the nostrils, and hfemorrhoidal discharges. %0a%3c In combination with seed of hyoscyamus, it brings away %0a%3c splinters of broken bones.

Some persons have called the %0a%3c part which is white and very light " pompholyx," and say that %0a%3c it is the ashes of copper and cadmia; whereas spodos is darker %0a%3c und heavier, being a substance scraped from the walls of the %0a%3c furnace, mixed with extinguished sparks from the metal, and %0a%3c sometimes with the residue of coals. When vinegar is combined %0a%3c with it, pompholyx emits a coppery smell, and if it is touched %0a%3c with the tongue, the taste is most abominable. It is useful as %0a%3c an ingredient in ophthalmic preparations for all diseases of the %0a%3c eyes, as also for all the purposes for which spodos is used; %0a%3c this last only differing from it in its action being less power- %0a%3c ful.

That, %0a%3c too, which has been washed with wine is more modified in its %0a%3c effects ; there being also some difference according to the kind of %0a%3c wine that is used. When it has been washed with weak wine %0a%3c the spodos is considered not so beneficial as an ingredient in %0a%3c medicaments for the eyes ; but the same kind of preparation is %0a%3c more efficacious for running sores, and for ulcers of the mouth %0a%3c attended with a discharge of matter, as well as in all those %0a%3c remedies which are used for gangrene. %0a%3c %0a%3c There is also a kind of spodos, called " lauriotis," 35 which %0a%3c is made in the furnaces where silver is smelted.

DIPHBYX. %0a%3c %0a%3c There is another product of these furnaces, which is easily %0a%3c distinguished from smegma, and which the Greeks call " di- %0a%3c phryx,''" from its being twice calcined. This substance is pre- %0a%3c pared from three different sources. It is prepared, they say, %0a%3c from a mineral pyrites, which is heated in the furnace until %0a%3c it is converted by calcination into a red earth. It is also %0a%3c made in Cyprus, from a slimy substance extracted from a cer- %0a%3c tain cavern there, which is first dried and then gradually heated, %0a%3c by a fire made of twigs. A third way of making it, is from %0a%3c the residue in the copper-furnaces that falls to the bottom. %0a%3c The difference between the component parts of the ore is this; %0a%3c the copper itself runs into the receivers, the scoriae make their %0a%3c escape from the furnace, the flower becomes sublimated, and %0a%3c the diphryx remains behind. %0a%3c %0a%3c Some say that there are certain globules in the ore, while %0a%3c being smelted, which become soldered together; and that the %0a%3c rest of the metal is fused around it, the mass itself not becoming %0a%3c liquefied, unless it is transferred to another furnace, and forming %0a%3c a sort of knot, as it were, in the metal. That which remains %0a%3c after the fusion, they say, is called "diphryx.

For by the aid of iron %0a%3c we lay open the ground, we plant trees, we prepare our vine- %0a%3c yard-trees, 47 and we force our vines each year to resume their %0a%3c youthful state, by cutting away their decayed branches. It is %0a%3c by the aid of iron that we construct houses, cleave rocks, and %0a%3c perform so many other useful offices of life. But it is with %0a%3c iron also that wars, murders, and robberies are effected, and %0a%3c this, not only hand to hand, but from a distance even, by the %0a%3c aid of missiles and winged weapons, now launched from en- %0a%3c gines, now hurled by the human arm, and now furnished with %0a%3c feathery wings. This last I regard as the most criminal %0a%3c artifice that has been devised by the human mind; for, as %0a%3c if to bring death upon man with still greater rapidity, we %0a%3c have given wings to iron and taught it to fly. 48 Let us there- %0a%3c %0a%3c 14 A Roman coin, equal to the third part of the " as."— B. %0a%3c %0a%3c * s We roost fully coincide with Pliny in this sentiment, but we are %0a%3c constrained to differ from him in giving credit to the alleged fact, as he %0a%3c appears to have done. — B. %0a%3c %0a%3c - 16 See the list of authors at the end of this Book. %0a%3c %0a%3c 47 " Arbusta:" trees on which vines were trained.

STATUES OF IRON ; CHASED WORKS IN IEON. %0a%3c %0a%3c Still, however, human industry has not failed to employ iron %0a%3c for perpetuating the honours of more civilized life. The %0a%3c artist Aristonidas, wishing to express the fury of Athamas %0a%3c subsiding into repentance, after he had thrown his son Learchus %0a%3c from the rock, 51 blended copper and iron, in order that the %0a%3c blush of shame might be more exactly expressed, by the rust of %0a%3c the iron making its appearance through the shining substance of %0a%3c the copper ; a statue which still exists at Rhodes. There is also, %0a%3c in the same city, a Hercules of iron, executed by Alcon, 52 the %0a%3c endurance displayed in his labours by the god having suggested %0a%3c the idea. We see too, at Rome, cups of iron consecrated in %0a%3c the Temple of Mars the Avenger. 53 Nature, in conformity %0a%3c with her usual benevolence, has limited the power of iron, by %0a%3c inflicting upon it the punishment of rust ; and has thus dis- %0a%3c played her usual foresight in rendering nothing in existence %0a%3c more perishable, than the substance which brings the greatest %0a%3c dangers upon perishable mortality. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 41.— THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF IRON, AND THE MODE OF %0a%3c TEMPERING IT. %0a%3c %0a%3c Iron ores are to be found almost everywhere ; for they exist %0a%3c %0a%3c * The charge that death is always the work of Nature.

The method of -working %0a%3c the ore is the 6ame as that employed in the case of copper. In %0a%3c Cappadocia, however, it is peculiarly questionable whether this %0a%3c metal is a present due to the water or to the earth ; because, %0a%3c when the latter has been saturated with the water of a certain %0a%3c river, it yields, and then only, an iron that may be obtained %0a%3c by smelting. %0a%3c %0a%3c There are numerous varieties of iron ore ; the chief causes %0a%3c of which arise from differences in the soil and in the climate. %0a%3c Some earths produce a metal that is soft, and nearly akin to %0a%3c lead ; others an iron that is brittle and coppery, the use of which %0a%3c must be particularly avoided in making wheels or nails, the %0a%3c former kind being better for these purposes. There is another %0a%3c kind, again, which is only esteemed when cut into short lengths, %0a%3c and is used for making hobnails ; 65 and another which is %0a%3c more particularly liable to rust. All these varieties are known %0a%3c by the name of " strictura," 56 an appellation which is not used %0a%3c with reference to the other metals, and is derived from the steel %0a%3c that is used for giving an edge. 57 There is a great difference, %0a%3c %0a%3c 54 The Isle of Elba, which has been celebrated for the extent and the %0a%3c richness of its iron mines both by the ancients and the moderns. — B. %0a%3c Ajasson remarks that it appears to be a solid rock composed of peroxide %0a%3c of iron. %0a%3c %0a%3c 55 " Clavis caligariis." See B. viii. c. 44. B. ix. c. 33, and B. xxii. c. 46. %0a%3c %0a%3c 56 There have been numerous opinions on the meaning of this word, %0a%3c and its signification is very doubtful. Beckmann has the following re- %0a%3c marks in reference to this passage : — " In my opinion, this was the name %0a%3c given to pieces of steel completely manufactured and brought to that state %0a%3c which rendered them fit for commerce. At present steel comes from %0a%3c Biscay in cakes, from other places in bars, and both these were formerly %0a%3c called ' strictures,' because they were employed chiefly for giving sharpness %0a%3c to instruments, or tools, that is, for steeling them. In speaking of other %0a%3c metals, Pliny says that the finished productions at the works were not called %0a%3c 'strieturae' (the case, for example, with copper), though sharpness could %0a%3c he given to instruments with other metals also. The words of Pliny just %0a%3c quoted are read different ways, and still remain obscure. I conjecture %0a%3c that he meant to say, that some steel-works produced things which were %0a%3c entirely of steel, and that others were employed only in steeling— 'ad %0a%3c densandas incudes malleorumve rostra.' I shall here remark that these %0a%3c 'strieturae ferri' remind us of the ' striges auri,' (see B. xxxiii. c. 19), %0a%3c such being the name given to native pieces of gold, which, without being %0a%3c smelted, were used in commerce." — Hist.

But the main difference results from the quality of %0a%3c the w ater into which the red-hot metal is plunged from time to %0a%3c time. The water, which is in some places better for this pur- %0a%3c pose than in others, has quite ennobled some localities for the %0a%3c excellence of their iron, Bilbilis, 68 for example, and Turiasso 49 %0a%3c in Spain, and Comum 60 in Italy; and this, although there are %0a%3c no iron mines in these spots. %0a%3c %0a%3c But of all the different kinds of iron, the palm of excellence %0a%3c is awarded to that which is made by the Seres, 01 who send it to %0a%3c us with their tissues and skins ; 62 next to which, in quality, is %0a%3c the Parthian 63 iron. Indeed, none of the other kinds of iron are %0a%3c made of the pure hard metal, a softer alloy being welded with %0a%3c them all. In our part of the world, a vein of ore is occasionally %0a%3c found to yield a metal of this high quality, as in Noricum 64 for %0a%3c instance ; but, in other cases, it derives its value from the %0a%3c mode of working it, as at Sulmo, 65 for example, a result owing %0a%3c to the nature of its water, as already stated. It is to be ob- %0a%3c served also, that in giving an edge to iron, there is a great differ- %0a%3c ence between oil-whetstones and water- whetstones, 66 the use %0a%3c of oil producing a much finer edge. It is a remarkable fact, %0a%3c that when the ore is fused, the metal becomes liquefied like %0a%3c %0a%3c long bars, in thickness resembling a steel used for sharpening.

THE METAL CALLED LIVE IKON. %0a%3c %0a%3c We shall speak of the loadstone in its proper place, 67 and of %0a%3c the sympathy which it has with iron. This is the only metal %0a%3c that acquires the properties of that stone, retaining them for a %0a%3c length of time, and attracting other iron, so that we may some- %0a%3c times see a whole chain formed of these rings. The lower %0a%3c classes, in their ignorance, call this " live iron," and the wound3 %0a%3c that are made by it are much more severe. This mineral is %0a%3c also found in Cantabria, not in continuous strata, like the %0a%3c genuine loadstone, but in scattered fragments, which they call %0a%3c " bullationes." 68 I do not know whether this species of ore is %0a%3c proper also for the fusion of glass, 69 as no one has hitherto tried %0a%3c it ; but it certainly imparts the same property as the magnet %0a%3c to iron. The architect Timochares 70 began to erect a vaulted roof %0a%3c of loadstone, in the Temple of Arsinoe, 71 at Alexandria, in order %0a%3c that the iron statue of that princess might have the appear- %0a%3c ance of hanging suspended in the air : 72 his death, however, %0a%3c and that of King Ptolemseus, who had ordered this monument %0a%3c to be erected in honour of his sister, prevented the completion %0a%3c of the project. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAT. 43.

Some affections are cured %0a%3c by cauterization with red-hot iron, the bite of the mad dog %0a%3c more particularly ; for even if the malady has been fully deve- %0a%3c loped, and h)'drophobia has made its appearance, the patient %0a%3c is instantly relieved on the wound being cauterized. 79 Water %0a%3c %0a%3c 74 See B. iv. o. 34. — B. %0a%3c %0a%3c ,5 Both the reading and the meaning of this passage are very doubtful. %0a%3c • 6 See B. v. c. 21.— B. %0a%3c %0a%3c 77 We may presume that Pliny supposed that the ancient links had %0a%3c been protected by some of the substances mentioned above, although this %0a%3c is not distinctly stated. — B.

FOURTEEN REMEDIES DERIVED FB.OM RUST. %0a%3c %0a%3c Rust itself, too, is classed among the remedial substances ; %0a%3c for it was by means of it that Achilles cured Telephus, it is %0a%3c naid, whether it was an iron weapon or a brazen one that he %0a%3c used for the purpose. So it is, however, that he is represented %0a%3c in paintings detaching the rust with his sword. 81 The rust of %0a%3c iron is usually obtained for these purposes by scraping old nails %0a%3c with a piece of moistened iron. It has the effect of uniting %0a%3c wounds, and is possessed of certain desiccative and astringent %0a%3c properties. Applied in the form of a liniment, it is curative of %0a%3c alopecy. Mixed with wax and myrtle-oil, it is applied to gra- %0a%3c nulations of the eyelids, and pustules in all parts of the body ■, %0a%3c with vinegar it is used for the cure of erysipelas ; and, applied %0a%3c with lint, it is curative of itch, whitlows on the fingers, and %0a%3c hang-nails. Used as a pessary with wool, it arrests female %0a%3c discharges. Diluted in wine, and kneaded with myrrh, it is %0a%3c applied to recent wounds, and, with vinegar, to condylomatous %0a%3c swellings. Employed in the form of a liniment, it alleviates %0a%3c gout. 82 %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP 46. SEVENTEEN REMEDIES DERIVED FROM THE SCALES %0a%3c %0a%3c OF IRON.

They arrest bleeding, also, more %0a%3c %0a%3c 80 I cannot agree with Delafosse in his remark that " this remedy also %0a%3c is much in use for coeliac and other affections at the present day." — B.

There %0a%3c are two kinds of it, the black and the white. 66 The white is %0a%3c the most valuable : it was called by the Greeks " cassiteros," 87 %0a%3c and there is a fabulous story told of their going in quest of %0a%3c it to the islands of the Atlantic, and of its being brought in %0a%3c barks made of osiers, covered with hides. 88 It is now known %0a%3c that it is a production of Lusitania and Gallaecia. 89 It is a %0a%3c sand found on the surface of the earth, and of a black colour, %0a%3c and is only to be detected by its weight. It is mingled with %0a%3c small pebbles, particularly in the dried beds of rivers. The %0a%3c miners wash this sand, and calcine the deposit in the furnace. %0a%3c It is also found in the gold mines that are known as "alutiae," 69 * %0a%3c %0a%3c 54 From the Greek vypov wXaarpov . — B. 65 See B. xxxv. c. 57. — B. %0a%3c %0a%3c 86 It is most probable that the " black lead" of Pliny was our lead, and %0a%3c the "white lead" our tin.

White lead was held in esti- %0a%3c mation in the days even of the Trojan War, a fact that is at- %0a%3c tested by Homer, who calls it " cassiteros." 91 There are two %0a%3c different sources of black lead : it being procured either from %0a%3c its own native ore, where it is produced without the intermix- %0a%3c ture of any other substance, or else from an ore which con- %0a%3c tains it in common with silver, the two metals being fused to- %0a%3c gether.

Indeed, the vapours from all %0a%3c metals destroy flies and gnats ; and hence it is that in mines %0a%3c there are none of those annoyances. 16 Some persons, during the %0a%3c process, mix lead-filings with the sulphur, while others substi- %0a%3c tute ceruse for sulphur. By washing, a preparation is made %0a%3c from lead, that is much employed in medicine : for this pur- %0a%3c pose, a leaden mortar, containing rain water, is beaten with a %0a%3c pestle of lead, until the water has assumed a thick consistency ; %0a%3c which done, the water that floats on the surface is removed %0a%3c with a sponge, and the thicker part of the sediment is left to %0a%3c dry, and is then divided into tablets. Some persons triturate %0a%3c lead-filings in this way, and some mix with it lead ore, or %0a%3c else vinegar, wine, grease, or rose-leaves. Others, again, %0a%3c prefer triturating the lead in a stone mortar, one of Thebaic %0a%3c stone more particularly, with a pestle of lead; by which %0a%3c process a whiter preparation is obtained. %0a%3c %0a%3c As to calcined lead, it is washed, like stibi 17 and cadmia. %0a%3c Its action is astringent and repressive, and it is promotive of %0a%3c cicatrization. The same substance is also employed in prepa- %0a%3c rations for the eyes, cases of procidence 18 of those organs more %0a%3c particularly ; also for filling up the cavities left by ulcers, and %0a%3c for removing excrescences and fissures of the anus, as well as %0a%3c hsemorrhoidal and condylomatous tumours.
