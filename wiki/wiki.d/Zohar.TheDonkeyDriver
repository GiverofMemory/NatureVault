text=The Donkey Driver %0a%0a%0a%0a74. Rabbi Elazar, the son of Rabbi Shimon, was on his way to visit his father- %0ain-law, Rabbi Yosi, the son of Lakunya, and Rabbi Aba accompanied him. A %0aman followed behind them, driving their donkeys. Rabbi Aba said, "Let us %0aopen the gates of the Torah, as it is time to correct our path." %0a%0aIn Aramaic, the language in which The Zohar was written, "driver" means %0a"one who pricks." This is because the donkey driver's function amounts to %0aforcing the donkeys to move by pricking them with the edge of his stick. %0a%0a75. Rabbi Elazar opened and said, "It is written: My Sabbaths you are to %0aobserve." Let us see: the Creator created the world in six days. And each day %0awould reveal His deeds, and gave strength to that day. When did He reveal %0aHis deeds and give them strength? On the fourth day of creation, for the first %0athree days were concealed completely, and would not be revealed. The fourth %0aday arrived, and He revealed the deeds and forces of all the days. %0a%0aThe phrase "He gave that day strength" means that He gave everything to %0athe day of Shabbat. For the six days are Sefirot HGT NHY that reveal on Shabbat %0a(Malchut) the work and the forces that were carried out during these days. %0a%0aYet, if the deeds of all the days are concealed, and only reveal at their end, %0aon Shabbat, then why is it written that they are revealed on the fourth day of %0acreation? The thing is that Malchut is called both the fourth and the seventh days: %0ashe is fourth with regard to the first three Sefirot HGT, called the "Patriarchs" %0a(Hesed is Avraham, Gevura is Yitzchak, and Tifferet is Yaakov), and seventh with %0aregard to the six Sefirot, after three additional Sefirot, called the "Sons": Netzah is %0aMoshe, Hod is Aaron, and Yesod is Yosef. %0a%0aMalchut herself is King David— the day of Sbabbat. Malchut grows and gradually %0aaccumulates her corrections in two principal stages, called Ibur (conception). %0aThe first three days correspond to Ibur Aleph (the first conception), and the %0a%0a223 %0a%0a%0a%0a224 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0asecond three days correspond to Ibur Bet (the second conception, Gadlut, the %0areception of Ohr Hochma). %0a%0aIn other words, Malchut is gradually created from Sefirot HGT of ZA in three %0adays, and forms on the fourth day as the Sefira Net^ah de ZA. Hence, at this stage in %0aher growth, Malchut is referred to as fourth from the Patriarchs. And then Shabbat %0acomes to our land (Malchut is called both land/ earth and Shabbat). The state that %0aMalchut achieves as a result of her growth from Sefirot NHY of ZA is called Shabbat %0aon earth. And this state she attains as the seventh Sefira from all the Sefirot of ZA. %0a%0aThe first three days are not revealed in Malchut, for as long as a Partzuf %0alacks Malchut, it is defined as concealed or secret. The weekdays are defined so. %0aAnd when Malchut completely attains the degree where she stands, she thereby %0aattains herself. This state is defined as Shabbat. %0a%0aHowever, if Malchut receives from the six Sefirot de ZA, shouldn't they (the six %0aweekdays) be more important than Malchut-Shabbat (inferior Sefira with regard %0ato those she receives from)? %0a%0aThe truth is that all the weekdays constitute individual degrees of correction %0a(weekdays' work) that are devoid of Malchut. Hence, they are called "weekdays," %0afor a Partzuf without Malchut is considered a closed degree, unable to receive %0aLight, and is therefore deprived of holiness. After all, in the absence of Malchut, %0athere is no GAR of the Light, Ohr Hochma. And only when Malchut is revealed %0ain the Partzuf (signifying the arrival of Shabbat) is the holiness of the ENTIRE %0adegree revealed; ENTIRE, because all six days receive what they have earned, %0aand the Light shines in all the weekdays thanks to them alone. %0a%0aWhen the first three days of creation HGT emerged before the emergence %0aof Malchut, these three Sefirot were devoid of Light, i.e., they were concealed. %0aAnd when Malchut appeared, the fourth day arrived, and the importance and %0aholiness of all four days manifested, for Malchut complements the entire degree, %0aand the perfection of creation becomes revealed thanks to her. In the language %0aof Kabbalah, this is described in the following way: all six days of creation are %0aOhr Hochma, and Shabbat is Ohr Hassadim. Ohr Hochma is present on weekdays, %0abut cannot shine for lack of Ohr Hassadim, and when Ohr Hassadim arrives on %0aShabbat, all the Ohr Hochma shines thanks to this Ohr Hassadim of Shabbat. %0a%0a76. There is fire, water and air— HQT — the three first days of creation. %0aAlthough they are the initial Supernal foundations of all that will follow, %0atheir actions are not revealed until the earth, meaning Malchut, reveals them. %0aOnly then does the work of each of the Supernal foundations reveal itself. %0aHence, the power of the first three days is revealed only on the fourth. %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Donkey Driver %0a%0a%0a%0a225 %0a%0a%0a%0a77. However, the third day may be better described as one that reveals the %0acreation of the first three days, as it is written: LET THE EARTH BRING %0aFORTH GRASS. That is to say, the revelation of the earth's (Malchut's) deeds %0aalready took place on the third day. Yet, although it was written on the third %0aday, Tifferet, it was actually the fourth day, Malchut. Malchut joined the %0athird day, for Tifferet and Malchut are inseparable. And then the fourth day %0arevealed its deeds— to elucidate the work of each and every one of HQT, for %0athe fourth day is the "fourth leg" of the Supernal Throne (the Sefira Bind), %0awhose four legs are HQTM (Hesed, Qevura, Tifferet, and Malchut). %0a%0aMalchut reveals the holiness and spiritual power of the three days. Therefore, %0aMalchut ascended and joined the third day, so as to reveal by the unity of these %0athree days (three lines) their exalted spiritual essence. %0a%0aIt is hence written that the deed is revealed on the fourth day, for Malchut %0aalone completes their revelation at the conclusion of the three days. And %0aafterwards, three more days emerge, which are NHY. After the revelation of %0athe holiness of the first three days, HGT, called the "Patriarchs," which are the %0afoundation of ZA, ZA enters them (his main part is manifested), and the time %0acomes for the Sons (NHY, the last three of the six days of creation) to be born. %0a%0aThis is why it is written that ZA is defined as the fourth leg of the throne %0aof Bina, and the throne remains imperfect and incomplete until its fourth leg %0a(foundation) manifests. Indeed, ZA is incomplete until Malchut manifests within %0ahim, i.e., until the fourth day arrives. And only after the emergence of Malchut %0acan ZA father the Sons— the three final days of creation. %0a%0a78. All of the actions of all the Sefirot, both on the first three days of creation, %0aHQT, and on the last three, NHY, are dependent on the day of Shabbat, %0aMalchut, QAR of the entire degree of ZA and its perfection. Hence, it is %0awritten, AND THE CREATOR RESTED ON THE SEVENTH DAY, %0aSHABBAT. This refers to the fourth leg of the throne, as the seventh and the %0afourth days are both Malchut. Only the fourth day is Malchut that includes %0athe Sefira Tifferet of ZA, from his chest upwards. Also, the seventh day is %0aMalchut of the entire ZA, and they merge together face to face in a Zivug. %0a%0aAlthough the first three days, HGT, end with the fourth day (the result of %0atheir actions), they nonetheless remain not entirely complete; their perfection %0amanifests only on Shabbat, together with the last three days, NHY. %0a%0aIt is therefore written that Sbabbat is the fourth leg of the throne, even %0athough it is the seventh day, for, although it emerges after the Sons, it also %0acompletes the deeds of the Patriarchs, as the first three days did not complete %0a%0a%0a%0a226 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0atheir corrections on the fourth day, and a seventh day, Shabbat, is needed to %0acomplete them. %0a%0aThe reason for this is that on the fourth day, Malchut is in the state of %0aKatnut, called the small phase of the Moon. As a result, the Moon (Malchut) %0areturns to the state called Shabbat, when all the Light of all the days of creation %0amanifest and shine within her. This is why the Light of the first three days of %0acreation becomes revealed only on Shabbat. %0a%0a79. Yet, if Shabbat is Malchut, then why does the Torah say, "My Sabbaths %0ayou are to observe," implying two? It is written of the two parts of Shabbat'. %0athe night (Malchut) and the day (ZA) that shines in Malchut. Thus, there %0ais no division between them, for they merge face to face in a Zivug, and are %0atherefore called two Sabbaths. %0a%0aHe asks: two Malchuyot (plural for Malchut) of the fourth and the seventh days %0aare completely separate, as is written, "You shall keep my Sabbaths," implying %0atwo? Yet, when we clarify that the fourth day manifests in perfection only on the %0aseventh day, it becomes clear that there is only one Shabbat. But what is meant %0ahere is ZA and Malchut that shine in the holiness of Shabbat, for this day is the %0amale, bestowing part (Zachar) that manifests in the female part (Malchut or Nukva). %0aHence, they are called Sabbaths (plural). However, by merging in perfection, they %0abecome a single whole. As a result, ZA also assumes the name of Shabbat. %0a%0a80. Following behind them with the donkeys, the donkey driver asked: "Why %0ais it said, 'You shall fear sanctity?'" They replied: "This refers to the sanctity of %0aShabbat." The donkey driver asked: "What is the sanctity of Shabbat?" They %0areplied: "It is the sanctity that descends from Above, from AVI." He said to %0athem, "If that is so, then Shabbatot (plural for Shabbat) are without sanctity, %0afor sanctity descends on it from Above, from AVI." Rabbi Aba answered him: %0a"It is indeed so." And it is said: "And call Shabbat a delight, a holy day dedicated %0ato the Creator." Shabbat and a holy day are mentioned separately. The donkey %0adriver asked: "If that is so, then what does a holy day mean to the Creator?" %0aHe replied: "That is when sanctity descends from Above, from ZA, and fills %0aShabbat, Malchut." The donkey driver objected, "But if sanctity descends %0afrom Above, then Shabbat itself is not a holy day. And yet, it is written, You %0ashall sanctify Shabbat,' meaning Shabbat itself." Rabbi Elazar said to Rabbi %0aAba, "Leave this man alone, for there is much wisdom in him, of which we do %0anot know." So he said to the donkey driver, "Speak, and we shall listen." %0a%0aThe donkey driver's question is this: if Shabbat is ZA, then why is it described %0aas holy? After all, sanctity is the property of AVI, and only AVI are called holy. %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Donkey Driver %0a%0a%0a%0a227 %0a%0a%0a%0aHence, he objected that Shabbat should be separated from sanctity. Shabbat (ZA) %0ais not holiness in itself, but because it receives holiness from Above, from AVI. %0aThat, which ZA receives from AVI is what is called the Creator's holiness. %0a%0a81. The donkey driver opened and said, "It is written: Shabbatot, i.e., there %0aare usually two. And this alludes to the border of Shabbat, which is 2,000 %0aAmaH (cubits) in each direction from the city. This is why the word Et was %0aadded before the word Shabbatot, which designates the plural form— both the %0aUpper Shabbat and the lower Shabbat joining into one." %0a%0aAlthough it is said: "Man shall not leave his place on the seventh day" %0a(Shemot, 16), i.e., the singular form is used, in many places in the Torah, the %0aword Et is used; for example, in the sentence: "Et 2,000 Amah in each direction %0afrom its place." The word Et, consisting of the first and the last letters of the %0aalphabet, Aleph and Tav, designates Malchut entering into union with ZA, %0awhich signifies the state of Shabbat; hence, the Light of AVI becomes revealed %0aand shines (as a supplementary luminescence) upon ZON. This is because AVI %0aare called "two thousand," and so the word Et is present here to designate a %0asupplement of Light to Shabbat. %0a%0aThere exist a Shabbat Above and a Shabbat below: the Upper Shabbat is Partzuf %0aTvuna, and the lower part of Partzuf Bina, whereas the lower Shabbat is Partzuf %0aMalchut, Nukva de ZA of the world of Atzilut. In the world of Atzilut, Partzuf Bina %0ais divided into two Partzuf im: the Upper Part of Bina is called Partzuf AVI and the %0alower part of Bina (the part where she receives the Light from the Upper Part %0aso as to pass it to ZA) is called Partzuf YESHSUT (Israel Saba ve Tvuna) or simply %0aTvuna. The relationship between Bina-AVI and Tvuna is similar to that of ZA %0aand Malchut. Bina is called the "Upper World" and Malchut is called the "lower %0aworld." On Shabbat, ZON ascend to Bina, ZA to AVI, and Malchut to Tvuna. %0a%0aOn Shabbat, Malchut merges with Tvuna. However, this does not mean that %0ano difference is left between them, for Malchut receives the Light from Tvuna %0aonly because she ascends to Tvuna 's level. Yet, at her place on the last, lowest %0adegree of the world of Atzilut, Malchut is unable to receive the Light from Tvuna. %0aAnd to the extent that Malchut cannot yet receive the Light from Tvuna in her %0aregular state, she is defined as "closed." %0a%0aAlso, Tvuna suffers from Malchut being closed because while in her place, %0aMalchut cannot receive the Light from Tvuna, for the revelation of Tvuna is %0apossible only through Malchut. On Shabbat, Tvuna and Ima join to form one %0aPartzuf, which is not closed. Yet, since its Light shines only when Malchut ascends %0ato it, Tvuna feels the closed state of Malchut, and suffers, too. %0a%0a%0a%0a228 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0a82. One Shabbat was left, unmentioned Above, and felt ashamed. She said to %0aHim, "The Creator of the universe, from the day I was created, I am called %0aShabbat, but there is no day without night." The Creator replied to her: "My %0adaughter, you are Shabbat, and I have given you this name. But now I am %0asurrounding and adorning you with the most exalted adornment." He then %0araised His voice and proclaimed, "Those who sanctify shall fear. And this is %0athe night of Shabbat that radiates fear." But who is she? It is the merging %0atogether of I (Malchut, the nights of Shabbat) with the Creator Himself (ZA) %0ainto a single whole. And I've heard from my father that the word Et refers %0ato the boundaries-borders of Shabbat. Shabbatot (two Sabbaths) denote a %0acircle and a square within, which total two. According to them, there are %0atwo sanctities we should mention during the Shabbat blessing: Vayechulu %0aconsists of thirty-five words, and Kiddush, too, consists of thirty-five words. %0aCollectively, they make up to the seventy names of ZA, with which ZA (the %0aCreator), and Malchut (the Assembly of Israel) adorn themselves. %0a%0a83. Since the circle and square are Shabbatot, they are both included in the %0ainstruction, "My Shabbatot you are to observe." However, the Upper Shabbat %0ais not included in the instruction "Observe," but rather in "Remember." For %0athe Supernal King, Bina is as perfect as memory. This is why Bina is called %0a"King," whose perfection lies in peace and in memory. Hence, there is no %0acontradiction Above. %0a%0aMalchut de Malchut is called the central point of creation, and receives no %0aLight even on Shabbat, as, being a Man'ula (lock), she is closed to the Light. %0aAnd the entire Light enters her only in the form of Miftacha (key), into Yesod de %0aMalchut, in Malchut that joins Bina with her properties, while Malchut herself is %0atherefore referred to as "locked." %0a%0aThis central point of creation is the only thing that the Creator created, and %0ais comprised of all the creatures, including human souls. And she argues with %0athe Creator that in the beginning of creation, in the world of AK, the entire %0aLight was revealed and shone upon the creatures thanks to her, for there was no %0aother Malchut in the world of AK, except for the central point. And only due to %0aTzimtzum Bet (second restriction), now in the world of Atzilut, was she restricted %0aand closed to the reception of Light. %0a%0aAnd this is a great and wonderful secret, for, as Malchut objects, even on %0athe first day, it is said: "And there shall be evening, and there shall be morning- %0aone day." (Beresheet, 1:6) In other words, unity is revealed in both night and %0aday together. Yet, why is the night of the first Shabbat not mentioned in the %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Donkey Driver %0a%0a%0a%0a229 %0a%0a%0a%0aTorah, and only the words "on the seventh day" are used? The Creator replied %0ato Malchut that a future Shabbat is implied— Shabbat of the seventh millennium, %0awhen the day of Shabbat will come and remain forever. %0a%0aMeanwhile, during the 6,000 years, the Creator elevates Malchut to Bina, and %0aas a result, she receives Supernal Adornments, greater than the ones she had had %0ain the world of AK. For there she acted as the end of all Sefirot, but now she has %0arisen to act in the place of GAR, in AVI, which are called "holy of holies." %0a%0aIf Malchut is in Yesod, the lack of Ohr Hochma is felt. But if Malchut ascends %0ato AVI (where Ohr Hassadim is present, and there is absolutely no need for Ohr %0aHochma), this state is defined as perfect. %0a%0aMalchut is called "fear," for she was restricted to refrain from receiving the %0aCreator's Light within her desire to receive pleasure. Therefore, she does not %0areceive the Light from Above within her desire to receive pleasure. Instead, %0ashe receives the Light only in Ohr Hozer (Returning Light), when she refuses %0ato use her egoism. %0a%0aThis occurs in the following way: first, Ohr Yashar (Direct Light) comes from %0athe Creator to Malchut and wishes to enter her (Malchut feels both the delight %0aand her own desire to receive and enjoy it). Secondly, by wishing to be like the %0aCreator, Malchut repels the Light (prohibits herself from receiving the delight). %0a%0aThis renunciation of egoistic pleasure is called Ohr Hozer (Returning Light), %0abecause Malchut repels the Light (pleasure) from her. Thirdly, after Malchut %0ahas created Ohr Hozer, she begins to receive Ohr Yashar in it (her new desire %0ato receive only because the Creator wants her to). This reception is possible %0abecause Malchut has an anti-egoistic force, will power, called a screen. %0a%0aThe spiritual world is a realm of sensations, desires, and forces, not vested %0ain shells-garments, like the corporeal bodies in our world. Similarly, all the %0acharacters depicted in Kabbalah do not designate any images; rather, they %0ademonstrate interactions of forces and properties. %0a%0aTherefore, a circle implies that the Light shines completely unrestrictedly in %0aevery place and to the same extent, so there can be no change in its radiance. %0aA square or a rectangle indicates restrictions, which create differences between %0athe sides: right and left, top and bottom. Hence, the head has a round shape %0awith regard to the rectangular shape of the body, for the Rosh (head) is free of %0arestrictions, but VAK (body) are not. %0a%0aShabbat is a spiritual state, when ZON ascend to AVI and clothe them. As %0aa result, the lower Shabbat (ZON) and the Upper Shabbat (AVI) merge into one. %0a%0a%0a%0a230 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Upper Shabbat (AVI) is designated by a circle, and the lower Shabbat (ZON) %0ais designated by a square. On Shabbat, ZON merge with AVI, depicted as the %0asquare's ascent and insertion into the circle. %0a%0aOhr Hochma is designated by the letter Ayin. Since Ohr Hochma is revealed %0aonly during the ascent of the lower Shabbat to the Upper, Ohr Hochma is %0adivided into two parts: one half for the Upper Shabbat, and one for the lower. %0aHence, the passage of Vayechulu (Beresheet, 2:1) consists of thirty-five words %0athat refer to half of the Light of the Upper Shabbat, whereas the blessing itself %0aconsists of thirty-five words that refer to half of the Light of the lower Shabbat. %0aAnd the common soul, called the "Assembly of Israel" or Malchut (Shabbat), is %0aadorned with this Light. %0a%0aSince the circle and the square merge and assume the name Shabbatot (two %0aShabbats), the Light of both the circle and the square is defined as protecting— %0aGUARD. And, although the word GUARD alludes to restrictions and borders %0athat one must observe and fear violating, whereas the Upper Shabbat (designated %0aby a circle) has no restrictions and borders, due to the joining of the two Shabbatot %0ainto one, there still appeared restrictions and borders. %0a%0aThe Upper Shabbat is called REMEMBER, and not OBSERVE, as it is %0acompletely free of restrictions. However, since it merged with the lower Shabbat, %0acalled OBSERVE, it, too, needs to GUARD, which normally relates to Malchut %0aalone. Only due to Malchut 's ascent to Bina did the need to guard, which is %0apresent in Malchut, arose in Bina. But Bina herself remains only in the property of %0aREMEMBER, for only egoistic desires to receive pleasure need GUARDING. %0a%0aThe Upper Shabbat (Bina) is designated by the letters MI = Mem-Yod. The %0alower Shabbat (Malchut) is designated by the letters MA = Mem-Hey, and has the %0aform of a square, which implies a presence of controversy between its properties— %0athe right and the left sides, which give it its square form. %0a%0a84. There are two types of peace below: one is Yaakov (Tifferet), and the other %0ais Yosef (Yesod). Therefore, PEACE is written twice in the greeting: "PEACE, %0aPEACE to the distant one and to the near one." "The distant one" refers to %0aYaakov, and "the near one" refers to Yosef. Or, as it is written, "From afar I %0asee the Creator," "Came to a stop far in the distance." %0a%0a"Below" signifies ZON, containing one of the properties, Yaakov or the Sefira %0aTifferet de ZA. ZON also contain the property called Yosef, or Yesod. Both these %0aSefirot indicate the place of a potential Zivug between ZA and Maichut, for Peace %0asignifies Zivug. The Upper Zivug (Yaakov) is intended for reception of Ohr Hochma %0afrom Above, and the lower Zivug (Yosef) fills Malchut only with Ohr Hassadim. %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Donkey Driver %0a%0a%0a%0a231 %0a%0a%0a%0aIt was already mentioned that it is impossible to receive Ohr Hochma without %0ait being clothed in Ohr Hassadim. Ohr Hochma or the Zivug that is made on it is %0atherefore defined as distant, for it must first be clothed in Ohr Hassadim before %0ait can receive Ohr Hochma. Hence, it is written, "From afar I saw the Creator." %0a%0aThe lower Zivug is called "the near one," because the Partzuf receives Ohr %0aHassadim without any preliminary actions. Furthermore, with the help of this %0aOhr Hassadim, the Partzuf subsequently receives Ohr Hochma. This is why the %0aword "peace" is used twice: "Peace, peace to the far and to the near"— a greeting %0ato Yaakov and Yosef, respectively, both of whom take part in the great Zivug (the %0areception of Ohr Hochma) in ZA. %0a%0aThese two greetings are defined in ZON as a square, as there is controversy %0abetween them, defined as the controversy between the right and the left sides, %0aand they end in the letter Hey—Nukva or Malchut, whereas the Upper Nukva %0a(Bina) ends with the letter Yod, which designates not the female part, but the %0amale. Hence, there is no controversy in her. %0a%0aEven the notions of "near" and "far" do not exist in Bina herself, for %0ashe refers to GAR, perfection, and GAR can receive Ohr Hochma nearby, %0ameaning they do not need to clothe in Ohr Hassadim beforehand, but can %0areceive Ohr Hochma without Ohr Hassadim. Hence, it is said that the Upper %0aMalchut is the King, who has peace. Thus, unlike ZON, two notions of peace %0aare absent in him. %0a%0a85. "From afar" is the Supernal Point, standing in His palace, of which it is said, %0a"You are to guard." "You shall fear My sanctity" refers to the point standing %0ain the center, which must be feared more than anything, for its punishment %0ais death, as it is written, "All who transgress in it shall perish." Who are these %0atransgressors? They are those who have entered the space of the circle and the %0asquare, and committed a sin. Hence, it is written, "You shall fear!" This point %0ais called "I," and there is a prohibition on its revelation, called HaVaYaH. "I" %0aand HaVaYaH are a single whole. Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Aba dismounted %0afrom their donkeys and kissed him. They said, "So great is your wisdom, and %0ayet you drive donkeys behind us! Who are you, then?" He replied to them: %0a"Do not ask me who I am, but let us go on and study the Torah. Each of us %0awill speak his wisdom so as to illuminate our path." %0a%0aThe distant point refers to the point that opens the way to the Partzuf for %0athirty-two streams of Ohr Hochma. And this is the letter Bet in the first word %0aof the Torah— Beresheet, called the "point in the hall," from which Ohr Hochma %0adescends to ZON, when ZON ascend to AVI. For then, the two Shabbatot (the %0a%0a%0a%0a232 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aUpper— AVI and the lower— ZON) merge. It is written about them: "I saw the %0aCreator from afar," for ZON cannot receive Ohr Hochma without being clothed %0ain Ohr Hassadim. %0a%0aHochma and Bina, called the "point in the hall," are referred to as "distant %0afrom ZON," for they need the garment of Ohr Hassadim from the lower world, %0aNulcva, called MA. Malchut of the world of AK is the central point, called the %0a"lock," whereas Malchut of the world of Atzilut (the point in the hall) is the %0a"key," as the Light from ZATde Bina (YESHSUT) can be received in it. %0a%0aThe circle is called AVI, the square— ZON. ZON ascend to AVI and thus %0athe square enters the circle. As a result, two properties appear in Malchut of %0aAVI: the "lock" (Malchut de Malchut, the central point or Malchut de AVI), and %0athe "key" (the point in the hall, Yesod de Malchut or Malchut de YESHSUT). %0aMalchut de AVI is called space, for she is unattainable, and he who wishes to %0afill her with Light is punished by death. It is written about it: "You shall fear %0aMy sanctity." %0a%0aThe point itself is called "I," and AVI is HaVaYaH that merges with it. And %0athey are defined as a single whole; hence, the point itself is referred to as AVI, %0ameaning that it is characterized as holy, as the property of AVI. %0a%0aAs was already mentioned before, The Zohar and the entire Torah speak %0aexclusively of spiritual degrees, the structure of spiritual worlds, and the %0arevelation of the Creator's governance to us. There is not a word in the Torah %0athat refers to our world. The whole Torah is, as it is said, "The Creator's sacred %0anames." And those who reduce it from its spiritual heights to the corporeal level %0atheir commentaries cast it down completely. %0a%0aRashi says that the Torah only speaks in human tongue, but it tells us of man's %0aspiritual paths toward his Creator. Therefore, when we read that one Rabbi went %0ato visit another, the real meaning is that one spiritual degree, called, for example, %0aRabbi Elazar, passes to another spiritual degree, called, for example, Rabbi Yosi. %0a%0aZA has his own AVI, who are called the Upper AVI. The wife of ZA (Nukva %0aor Malchut) contains AVI, too, called YESHSUT. First, ZA attains the AVI of his %0awife (YESHSUT or Ohr Hassadim). Then it rises to a Higher Degree and attains %0athe AVI themselves— Ohr Hochma (also called Ohr Haya). %0a%0aThe righteous who ascend the spiritual degrees are the constituents of %0aPartzuf ZA. Since the degree of Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Aba is Ohr Hassadim (the %0aLight of Neshama), this ascent means it went to (spiritually) see (in Ohr Hochma) %0aanother spiritual degree. %0a%0a%0a%0a%0aThe Donkey Driver %0a%0a%0a%0a233 %0a%0a%0a%0aIn the spiritual worlds, the donkey driver constitutes a special spiritual force %0athat helps the souls of the righteous move from one spiritual degree to another. %0aWithout this help sent by the Creator from Above, it is impossible to exit your %0adegree and ascend to the next. Hence, the Creator sends a Higher soul from %0aAbove to each of the righteous (those who wish to ascend). Each receives his %0aown, according to his degree, properties, and purpose. %0a%0aAnd so, at first the righteous fails to recognize this exalted soul; he %0aconsiders it low, that it leeched onto him on his spiritual path. Such state %0ais called Ibur— conception of the righteous' soul. Since the Higher soul has %0anot yet completed its assistance and purpose, it is not yet perceived by the %0arighteous for what it really is. %0a%0aHowever, after it completes its task in its entirety, and brings the righteous' %0asoul to the Upper Degree for which it is intended, the righteous then reveals %0athe exalted properties of the soul that helped him. This is referred to as the %0arevelation of the soul to the righteous. %0a%0aIn our case, the soul that was sent to help the souls of Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi %0aAba was the soul of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba— a very exalted and perfect soul, the %0aLight of Yechida. Yet, initially, it is revealed to the righteous in its smallest scope, %0acalled Ibur, conception (in sensations). Hence, they perceive it as the level of a %0aspiritual donkey driver— a simple soul. %0a%0aThe Hebrew word for donkey is Hamor, which also means matter, Homer] %0aThus, one who can control his donkey, his body, his desires, ascends above matter %0aas a spiritual being. And since he wishes to ascend above matter in his desires, he %0ais considered a righteous. However, here, The Zohar speaks of Higher Degrees. %0a%0aThe donkey driver's task is to take the riders, mounted atop of their donkeys, %0afrom place to place; yet, he walks in front of his donkeys, thereby leading them %0athrough spiritual degrees. Since every word in the Torah has several meanings, %0adue to the multiplicity of the Upper Roots (wherefrom word notions descend), %0athe notion of a "donkey driver" is more precisely referred to as a "donkey guide," %0aand implies properties that are coarse, sinful, and most base. %0a%0aTherefore, Rabbi Aba said: "Let us open the gates of the Torah, for the time %0ahas come for us to correct our path," that is, to open their souls with the help %0aof the secrets of the Torah, so their path would be correct and lead them to %0athe Creator. Rabbi Elazar then began to discuss a passage from the Torah that %0asays, "You shall observe my Shabbatot," as he stood at this degree (the Light of %0aYESHSUT) in his properties. He therefore concluded that Shabbat itself is the %0aproperty of ZON, which has not yet reached the property of sanctity, but only %0a%0a%0a%0a234 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0areceives the Light of YESHSUT on Shabbat. It is written about this Light, "You %0ashall fear my sanctity," for when Ohr Hochma passes from YESHSUT to ZA, it %0aevokes fear in them. %0a%0aAnd here they receive the donkey driver's help, who reveals to them the %0asecret of Ohr Haya. He explains that the phrase "You shall observe my Shabbatot" %0asignifies the Upper and the lower Shabbatot, which come together, due to the %0aascent of ZON to AVI. As a result, ZON themselves become holy (the square %0awithin the circle) and acquire the properties of Bina: mercy, altruism, Ohr %0aHassadim. Hence, it is written with regard to them: fear not and observe. For %0aOhr Haya repels foreign, impure forces and desires, and all restrictions are lifted %0aon Shabbat; hence, there is no fear. %0a%0aAnd, according to the donkey driver's explanation, the phrase "You shall %0afear My sanctity" refers only to the central point that is used in GAR de AVI, in %0aGAR of Ohr Haya, which is unattainable and where fear does exist. %0a%0aAt that, the soul of the donkey driver has fulfilled its role, for it brought %0athem to the attainment of Ohr Haya. Only then did they merit the attainment %0aof the height of the soul that had helped them, since they attained its revelation %0aand were thus able to appreciate it. %0a%0aThis is why Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Aba dismounted from their donkeys %0aand kissed him, for the attainment of the Upper One is defined as a "kiss." %0aHowever, this exalted soul has not yet finished aiding them: it must still help %0athem attain Ohr Yechida. Yet, since the attainment of Ohr Haya already provides %0aperfection, they've already attained thereby the degree of the son of Rabbi %0aHamnuna-Saba. %0a%0aThe level of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba himself is the degree of attainment %0aof Ohr Yechida. Therefore, by attaining only Ohr Haya, they mistakenly %0athought that the soul guiding them belongs to the son of Rabbi Hamnuna- %0aSaba. However, after the donkey driver had revealed to them the secret of the %0aattainment of Ohr Yechida, they realized that their companion is none other %0athan Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba himself. %0a%0aAnd the reason why they could not recognize him before is that the powers %0aof the helping soul cannot be seen until its role is fulfilled. Hence, they asked %0ahim to reveal his name, but he told them not to inquire about his name, for %0awithout having completed all the corrections, they do not merit the revelation %0aof the secrets of the Torah. And he must help them in their studies of the %0aTorah, for he still needs to illuminate their path, as they have not yet attained %0athe desired goal. %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Donkey Driver %0a%0a%0a%0a235 %0a%0a%0a%0a86. He said to him: "Who appointed you to walk here and be a donkey driver?" %0aHe replied: "The letter Yod waged war with two letters, Chaf and Samech, for %0ame to come and join. The letter Chaf did not want to leave its place because it %0ahas to support those who fall, for without a screen, they cannot survive." %0a%0a87. The letter Yod came to me alone, kissed me and wept with me. It said to %0ame, "My son, what can I do for you? I disappear from many good deeds and %0afrom secret, supernal, basic letters. But I shall return to you and will be of %0ahelp to you. And I shall give you two letters that are more exalted than those %0athat have disappeared— the letters Yod and Shin. They shall become for you a %0atreasury that is forever full. So, my son, go and drive the donkeys. And that is %0awhy I am here in this role." %0a%0aAs we already know, the donkey driver is an auxiliary force given to someone %0awho wishes to ascend to a higher spiritual degree on his path toward the Creator, %0ajust as donkeys carry people on their backs, thereby helping them travel from %0aone place to another. As this happens, the righteous one falls from his previous %0adegree and enters the embryonic state of the new degree, just as the soul that %0acame to help him. However, the property of Ibur-embryo (lbur is also derived %0afrom the word Haavarah, crossing) means that all the Light that it had in the %0aprevious degree disappears upon the conception (lbur) of a new, Higher Degree. %0a%0aAnd that is what they wanted to know of the donkey driver: "How did the %0aCreator bring you here in the state of lbur, in our state of lbur, as a result of which %0athe Light in us has disappeared? Who lowers you from the Higher Degrees?" %0aAnd that is why the donkey driver replied that the letter Yod waged war against %0athe letters Chaf and Samech, to join with them. The degree of Hassadim is called %0aSamech (Ohr Neshama). %0a%0a"When the time has come for you to attain Ohr Haya (Yod from HaVaYaH, %0athe degree from which I descended to help you to attain Ohr Haya), Hochma %0areally wanted to connect Ohr Neshama (that was previously in you) to me. And %0ahere Yod wages war against Chaf and Samech. Malchut of the Upper Partzuf %0aclothes in the lower Partzuf, designated by the letter Chaf. There used to be Ohr %0aNeshama, and now there is Ohr Haya, whereas Yod, which desires Ohr Neshama %0aas well, merges with it, and rejects the Chaf." %0a%0aThis is so because the connection between the degrees, from the Highest %0aDegree in the world of Atzilut to the end of the world of Assiya, is realized only %0aby Malchut of the Upper One descending to the lower one and clothing in it. %0aMalchut of the Upper One herself cannot descend from her degree of YESHSUT %0a%0a%0a%0a236 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0a(the degree of Neshama) even for a moment, as the chain connecting the degrees %0awould be instantly broken. %0a%0aThe property of Samech is the property of the Light itself, which the soul %0areceives from Sefirot HBD HGT of AVI (above the Cha^eh), and which AVI pass %0ato ZON when the letters are in Katnut, and support them (the Hebrew word for %0asupport is Somech, derived from the letter Samech) so that ZON will not fall from %0athe world of Atzilut. %0a%0aThe letter Chaf, Hassadim, is unwilling to leave its place and join Hochma, %0aas it needs to connect the Upper Partzuf to the lower one. Thus, it must always %0aremain in its place, for all the degrees are constant, and only the soul changes %0awhile moving from one degree to another within the worlds. This is why the %0asoul is called the "inner part" with regard to the world (the external part)— the %0asoul exists and moves about within the world by changing its properties. %0a%0aHence, the Light of the soul did not wish to join the letter Yod (degree of %0aHochma, the soul of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba) as it descended to help Rabbi Elazar %0aand Rabbi Aba. This is because they needed a new Light that would build a new %0adegree within them, the degree of Ohr Haya, whereas each new degree is built from %0ascratch, from the state of Ibur (conception). As that happens, the entire previous %0adegree with all of its Light disappears. Similarly, in their case, the new degree %0astarts with Ibur and reaches the level of Haya. This resembles a seed that must %0afirst abandon its present form and rot, in order to become a tree afterwards. %0a%0aIt is therefore written that it came to me without the Light of HBD HGT %0ade AVI, called Samech, the Light of Hassadim. Samech is the property of mercy, a %0aselfless desire to give, pure spiritual altruism. Hence, it is unwilling to join Yod, %0aOhr Hochma. Yet, Ohr Hochma cannot enter and fill the Partzuf without first %0abeing clothed in Ohr Hassadim, for this clothing of Ohr Hochma in Ohr Hassadim %0ameans that the Partzuf receives Ohr Hochma not for itself, but for the Creator's %0asake. But Ohr Hassadim, Samech, does not wish to receive anything within itself; %0ait wants nothing to do with Ohr Hochma] This is why the letter Yod wept, being %0aunable to fill the Partzuf with its Light, for Hassadim refused to accept Hochma. %0a%0aIt is written in this regard: Hence, I must now disappear, and you, the donkey %0adriver, go to the state of Ibur, to rebuild the degrees of gradual development of %0aa new Part?u/-state with you: Ibur (embryo), Leidah (birth), Yenika (nursing), and %0aMochin (maturity). %0a%0aAnd know that such is the order of creating (begetting) each new degree: %0aevery time one is to attain a new degree, he must undergo (in his properties) a %0acomplete disappearance of the previous degree (level of attainment, Light), and %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Donkey Driver %0a%0a%0a%0a237 %0a%0a%0a%0abegin anew. He must receive new attainments, from the lowest new degree, Ohr %0aNefesh (Ibur), to Ohr Ruach (Yenika), and so on, as though he had never attained %0aany spiritual level at all. %0a%0aIt is impossible to take with you anything from a previous degree. Hence, one %0amust start anew from the lowest level of Ibur, called THE DONKEY DRIVER. %0aOhr Haya de AVI is called YESH (Yod-Shin), where Yod is Hochma and Shin is Bina. %0aAnd, of course, they are more important than the Ohr Neshama that was in the %0aPartzuf before them. %0a%0a88. Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Aba rejoiced, wept, and said, "You sit on the %0adonkey, and we shall drive it." He replied to them, "Have I not told you that %0ait is the command of the King that I act as I do, until the other donkey driver %0aappears" (this hints at the Mashiach, who, as it is said, will appear poor and %0ariding a donkey). They said to him, "You have not even told us your name! %0aWhere do you dwell?" He told them, "My dwelling place is wonderful %0aand very precious to me. It is a tower that soars in the air, grand and unique. %0aOnly two live in this tower: the Creator and I. That is the place, in which %0aI dwell. And I am exiled from there in order to drive the donkeys." Rabbi %0aElazar and Rabbi Aba looked at him, and his words were unclear to them, for %0athey tasted sweeter than manna and honey. They said to him, "Perhaps you %0awill tell us the name of your father, so that we could kiss the earth at his feet?" %0aHe responded, "What for? It is not my habit to boast of the Torah." %0a%0aAfter they have attained the greatness of the donkey driver's degree, they %0acould no longer bear his small state of Ibur, which he inhabited for their sake. %0aHence, they told him that since they have already attained Ohr Hochma, he has %0adone enough and can leave the state of Ibur. And should a need arise to add %0aanything else to them, they would be able to enter Ibur on their own, and he %0adoes not need to suffer for their sake. %0a%0aHowever, the donkey driver warned them beforehand to not ask him his %0aname, for they still require revelations of secrets of the Torah. Once again, he %0ahinted that it is the degree of Ohr Yechida that they lack, which is implied here. %0aThis degree signifies the reception of the Light of the King Messiah's face, %0awhich he mentioned by hinting at the poor donkey driver, as described by a %0aprophet (Zachariah, 9:9). And he is commanded by the Creator to help them %0aattain Ohr Yechida. %0a%0aThis is why they asked him about the type of his soul: "For you did not wish %0ato reveal your name, as we have not yet received from you that which we must %0a%0a%0a%0a238 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aattain. But if so, at least tell us where you live, what is your degree? At least then %0awe will know what we lack, what else we must receive, attain from you." %0a%0aHe replied that his place is much higher than his present location, for now %0ahe himself cannot attain his own individual level. This is a result of the Upper %0aPartzuf descending to the place of the lower one and becoming completely %0aidentical to it, and while there (in that state), the Upper Partzuf can no longer %0aattain its own level. The tower that soars in the air is Bina, Hassadim. The %0aMashiach's tower (the great tower) designates the time (state) of ascent to GAR de %0aAA, when Ohr Hochma is available. %0a%0a89. But the place of my father's dwelling was in the Great Sea. And he was %0aa big fish that continually circled the Great Sea, from one end to the other. %0aAnd he was mighty and he grew old, until he swallowed up all the other fish %0ain that sea. And then he released them, and they were thriving and filled %0awith all of the very best of the world. And it was in his power to swim across %0athe entire sea in one instant. And He pulled him out and hauled him in %0awith an arrow, like a warrior, and brought him to the place that I told you %0aabout, to the tower that soars in the air, but he returned to his place and %0adisappeared in that sea. %0a%0aThe concealed Zivug is called Shaar HaNun (the 50 th gate). The Great Sea is %0aMalchut. All the Zivugim from Partzuf Atik de Atzilut and below do not include %0athe Great Sea in its entirety, all the Sefirot of Malchut, but only the first nine %0aSefirot of Malchut. Moreover, none of the Zivugim include Malchut de Malchut. %0a%0aThis Sefira, Malchut de Malchut, is the only creation, because all the other %0aSefirot constitute properties of spiritual forces and desires above Malchut, existing %0ain and referring to the Creator, the sole purpose of which is the correction of %0aMalchut de Malchut. The only Zivug on this Malchut exists in Atik, and it will be %0arevealed to all only at the end of correction. %0a%0aRav Hamnuna-Saba emerged from this concealed Zivug in Atik; hence, the %0adonkey driver calls him "my father." And he says that his father lived in the %0aGreat Sea, as this Zivug was on the entire Malchut, on Malchut de Malchut, called %0athe "Great Sea." %0a%0aYet, if one were to argue that all Partzufim make a Zivug on the Light with %0aa screen that stands before Malchut, then that Zivug was made on the 50 th gate, %0aon all the parts of the desire, on the full depth of the Great Sea (Malchut), down %0ato the very last of her desires and properties, from Keter de Malchut to Malchut %0ade Malchut, from end to end of the Great Sea. Nevertheless, this occurs only %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Donkey Driver %0a%0a%0a%0a239 %0a%0a%0a%0aIn Partzuf Atik de Atzilut, but not below it. And this is not the donkey driver %0ahimself, but his father. %0a%0aThis occurs because the great Zivug absorbs all the other particular Zivugim %0a("swallows all the other fish in the Great Sea") and all the souls in all the worlds, %0afor they are all much weaker than it. Hence, it is as though they do not exist in %0aits greatness and might. And since it includes absolutely everything, they are all %0acalled by the name Nunin, from the letter Nun (50). %0a%0aThis indicates that after all the major corrections that follow this great Zivug, %0aall those Lights and souls, absorbed during its Zivug, return and are born anew %0afor eternal life, for they are completely filled with Light as a result of the great %0aZivug, when the Light absorbed them completely. %0a%0aAll the Zivugim below Partzuf Atik stem from unifications of the Sefirot with %0aone another. These unifications are defined as interruptions in a Zivug, whereas %0athe Zivug in Atik is direct and without unification. Thus, it is defined as "instant," %0afor it goes on uninterrupted. It is therefore written that "he crosses the entire %0asea in an instant," without any garments-unifications. And it mounts an attack, %0afor there is great power of reception of Ohr Hochma in this Zivug; hence, he said: %0a"Begets, like an arrow in the hands of a warrior." %0a%0aIt is written of this Zivug in Partzuf Atik: "No one else but you saw the %0aCreator." However, no birth is possible without the forces of resistance, since, %0aas is written: "The seed that is not shot like an arrow does not beget." (Talmud, %0aHagigah, 16). Hence, after he had begotten me and hid me in the Great Tower, %0ahe returned to his concealed Zivug. %0a%0a90. Rabbi Elazar contemplated his words and replied: "You are the son of the %0aHoly Source, you are the son of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba, you are the son of the %0aSource of the Torah, and you drive donkeys behind us!" They wept and kissed %0ahim, and continued their journey. Then he said: "If it pleases our master, let %0ahim reveal his name to us." %0a%0aIt is written "looked," because sight signifies Hochma, and no other words, %0asuch as "said," "heard" (Bina) or "thought" could be used in its stead. Since they %0ahave not yet attained to the full extent of perfection what the donkey driver %0ahad told them, and their attainment reached only as high as Ohr Haya, they %0awere delighted with what was begotten by Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba, for Rabbi %0aHamnuna-Saba is Ohr Yechida. %0a%0aHe asked him to reveal his name, that is, to receive his degree, for the %0aattainment of a name denotes the attainment of the spiritual degree. Therefore, %0athe saying, "the entire Torah consists only of the Creator's names," means that the %0a%0a%0a%0a240 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aentire Torah constitutes the degrees that one must attain, up to the very highest, %0acalled "Love" ("Introduction to The Study of the Ten Sefirot," items 70-71). %0a%0aEach degree in the attainment of the Upper Worlds has its own name. All %0athe Creator's names: Moshe, Pharaoh, Avraham, the Temple, Sinai— every single %0aword in the Torah— are degrees of perception of the Creator, degrees of attaining %0aHim, for nothing exists besides man and his Creator. Everything else that exists %0ain the world, as it seems to us, are the various degrees of our perception of the %0aCreator Himself. He may appear to us as this world, and He may appear as the %0aworld of Assiya, as Yetzira, Beria, Atzilut, or He may be revealed completely, without %0apartial concealments of the spiritual world or total concealment of our world. %0aThus, the word Olam (world) is derived from the Haalamah (concealment). %0a%0a91. He opened and began. It is written, "Benayahu (Benaiah) Ben (the son %0aof) Yehoyada (Jehoiada)." This narrative is beautiful, but it serves to show %0aus the exalted secrets of the Torah. And the name Benayahu Ben-Yehoyada %0aindicates the secret of the Light of Wisdom, Ohr Hochma. Ben Ish Choi %0ais the righteous who revives the worlds. Rav Paalim means that He is the %0aMaster of all that transpires, and that all the forces and Supernal Troops %0astem from Him. He is called the Creator of Force, the Master of all, and He %0ais in everything. %0a%0aIt is written in Prophets: "Benayahu, the son of Yehoyada," (Shmuel II, %0a23:20). Here, The Zohar reveals to us the exalted secrets of the Torah, for the %0aholy name of Yehoyada consists of two: Yod-Hey-Vav, the first three letters of %0aHaVaYaH, and Yeda (knowledge). %0a%0aKeter of the world of Atzilut is called RADLA (unattainable head), whereas %0aAtik itself surrounds all the other Partzufim of the world of Atzilut— AA, AVI, and %0aZON. Atik is called Makif (surrounding), for the other, lower Partzufim cannot %0aattain it or its Zivug. Moreover, they cannot attain anything that comes from it. %0aIn other words, there is nothing descending from Atik to the lower Partzufim. %0aEven AA is concealed from them; hence, it is called the "concealed Hochma." %0aHowever, it is not defined as unattainable, like Atik, for it contains a Zivug on %0aOhr Hochma. Nevertheless, this Light does not descend to the lower ones, but %0aonly a small luminescence from it, called He'arat Hochma, reaches them. %0a%0aAnd all the Light that fills the worlds through the 6,000 years comes from %0aAVI and YESHSUT, who are called Hochma of the thirty-two paths or thirty-two %0aforces (Elokim) of creation, i.e., thirty-two types of He'arat Hochma. This Light of %0aHochma is the result of Bina's ascent to AA, where she receives Ohr Hochma and %0ashines downward. Therefore, all the Light of Hochma that is revealed through %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Donkey Driver %0a%0a%0a%0a241 %0a%0a%0a%0athe 6,000 years, before the end of correction, is no more than the Light of Bina, %0awhich received Ohr Hochma upon ascending to AA. %0a%0aAA is called Yeda (knowledge) because it gives Ohr Hochma to Bina, and %0aknows all the routes of Ohr Hochma into Bina and through her on to the lower %0aones. While making a Zivug, AA itself does not pass its Light downwards, but %0aas AVI ascend to AA, they receive Ohr Hochma, called "thirty-two streams" or %0a"paths of wisdom," which can be attained by the lower ones. %0a%0aEverything that is written in The Zohar refers to all the souls in general. %0aHowever, there are exceptions that are not normally studied. There exist special, %0aexalted souls that merit becoming a Kli, MAN for the great Zivug of RADLA %0aafter their exile, and to receive from this Zivug in the Upper World the degree %0aof Yechida. These are the souls of Benayahu Ben-Yehoyada, Rabbi Hamnuna- %0aSaba and a very few chosen others. These exalted souls reveal themselves to the %0arighteous in this world, and as a result, the righteous merit delighting in Ohr %0aYechida, which shines only in such exalted souls, while still being in this world. %0a%0aTherefore, the name of Benayahu Ben-Yehoyada indicates that it stems from %0athe inner wisdom, the unattainable Light of Hochma of Atik. This name also %0acauses the concealment of the Light of Hochma, for the name Yehoyada: Yod-Hey- %0aVav + Yeda means that only he who attains the first three letters Yod-Hey-Vav of %0athe Creator's name HaVaYaH shall attain Him, and no other shall. %0a%0aTherefore, this name remains concealed in its place. At first, the donkey %0adriver explains the quality of this Zivug in Atik— its height, the power of the Light %0athat emerges onto it in Rosh de Atik, which the name of this Zivug, "Ben hh Chai %0aRav Paalim ve Mekabtziel," indicates. And then he explains what is concealed and %0awhat descends to the souls. %0a%0aIt was already stated that this Zivug takes place at the end of the correction of %0athe entire Malchut. Hence, it includes all the individual Zivugim and the degrees %0athat emerge on them through the 6,000 years. All the Lights accumulate into %0aone. All the types of MAN combine into one and ascend to ask for this Zivug, %0awhich includes all the suffering and punishments gradually accumulated during %0athe 6,000 years. %0a%0aHence, the height and greatness of this Zivug and the degree of Light that %0aemerges from it are infinite, and it destroys all the impure forces once and for %0aall. Yesod de ZA, from which the Light of this Zivug (the combination of all the %0aLights over the full course of the 6,000 years) is emanated, is called "hh Chai Rav %0aPaalim"— a vivid man of many actions. However, Malchut, which contains within %0a%0a%0a%0a242 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aher all the MAN, suffering, and work performed during the 6,000 years, is called %0aMekabtziel (gathering one). %0a%0aThe Zohar also calls it Tzadik Chai Olamim— the righteous, who revives the %0aworlds, for it thereby points to the Sefira Yesod, which gives the Light to Malchut. %0aThe Sefira Yesod does not have a place to receive the Light for itself. Hence, it %0alives (Chai) only to pass the Light to Malchut. This is why it is called Tzadik (the %0arighteous one), who revives the worlds (Chai Olamim). %0a%0aIts other name, Rav Paalim (performing many actions) indicates that %0ait includes all the MAD of all the good deeds and all the degrees that were %0arevealed through the 6,000 years. This is because all these degrees are now being %0arevealed all at once in a cumulative, integrated Light, as they leave Yesod and %0aenter Malchut. And since Yesod now gathers all the Light that was emanated %0aduring the 6,000 years into one, and passes it to Malchut, this action determines %0aits name— Rav Paalim. %0a%0a92. Rav Paalim is also Mekabtziel— the Exalted Tree, gathering and %0aperforming many actions, Supreme Above all. Where did it come from? %0aFrom which degree did it originate? Once more, the source indicates— from %0aMekabtziel, for it is an exalted and concealed degree that none has seen. %0aIt includes everything, for it gathers all of the Upper Light within it, and %0aeverything originates from it. %0a%0aMalchut-Nukva is also named Mekabtziel, for she receives and gathers all the %0aLight from Yesod within herself. Hence, Yesod is called Rav Paalim. The degree %0athat emerges onto this Zivug is called the "Supreme and Exalted Tree" that %0aoriginated from Yesod and entered Malchut. The Zohar goes on to explain that to %0ashow us the quality and the origin of this exalted degree, the name Mekabtziel %0a(gathering) is used; Yesod accumulates the Upper Light and passes it to Nukva. %0aAnd both Yesod and Malchut are called Mekabtziel %0a%0aAnd the degree that emerges onto this Zivug of Yesod and Malchut is called %0a"None but you has seen the Creator." This degree emerges after the complete %0acorrection has been achieved, at the moment of attachment of the final correction %0athat completes them all. Therefore, this degree is defined as all-inclusive, for it %0acollects all the Light over the full course of 6,000 years, and thereby manifests at %0aonce in its true perfection. %0a%0a93. All of the degrees gather in this Supernal, Sacred, and Concealed Hall, %0awhere everything is concealed. All of the worlds are inside that hall. All the %0aholy forces are sustained and revived by it, and all are dependant on it. %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Donkey Driver %0a%0a%0a%0a243 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar speaks of Rosh de Atik, where all the degrees and all the Light %0aof all the worlds are concentrated and concealed. It further explains how this %0aZivug can occur up to the final correction, so it would combine all the degrees %0aemerging one after another during the 6,000 years. And it would emerge instantly %0aduring the 6,000 years of the world's existence, when the degrees are in a state of %0aconstant ascents and descents, for as soon as a new degree, a new attainment of %0athe Creator, of the Light, is revealed, the present degree disappears. This occurs %0adue to the sin of the lower ones, who cannot retain this degree permanently %0a(world— Olam, from the word Haalamah— concealment. The complete revelation %0aof the Creator to His Creatures will take place at the end of the 6,000 years; %0athus, the world-concealment will cease to exist). %0a%0aSo, whenever a degree disappears, it does so only from the sensation of one %0awho attains a new degree. In reality, this degree ascends to Rosh de Atik and hides %0athere, so as to, by joining other degrees, be manifested at the end of correction. %0a%0aIn the same way, Atik gathers all the degrees revealed in the world during %0athe 6,000 years, and conceals them within itself until the time of the end of %0acorrection comes; WHEN IT CORRECTS THE LAST PORTION OF WHAT %0aIT MUST CORRECT, AND THUS CANNOT NO LONGER SIN. AND IT %0aNO LONGER NEEDS TO SIN TO CORRECT THE NEXT PORTION OF %0aEGOISM; HENCE, THIS FINAL DEGREE REMAINS PERMANENTLY %0aAND DOES NOT DISAPPEAR. Then, Atik gathers all the degrees, and they all %0amanifest simultaneously. %0a%0aEveryone has his own Partzuf Atik. How can one accelerate his advancement %0along the degrees of correction in this world and in the spiritual worlds? It if %0aritten in the Talmud that an old man bends as he walks, as if he's looking %0ajmething that he had lost. %0a%0aAn old man symbolizes someone of wisdom, Hochma, for even without ha %0alost anything, he looks beforehand for things he can correct in himself, and %0afinds them. Hence, he does not require the previous degree of attainment to %0adisappear from him. And if one does not discover new egoistic properties in %0aneed of correction within him, his previous degree disappears and a new one %0abegins. However, this process is considerably slower than when one acts like %0aold man in search of shortcomings. %0a%0aThroughout the 6,000 years, Atik is defined as unattainable. Therefore, its %0ahead is called RADLA (an abbreviation for the Aramaic words, Reisha de Lo %0aEtiada, the "unattainable head"), whereas the name Atik is derived from the %0aword Ne'etak (isolated) from the lower ones, for it does not shine upon them. %0a%0a%0a%0a244 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aAnd, although it accumulates within all the Lights that emerge from it itself and %0abecome revealed in the lower worlds, the Light of the end of correction remains %0aconcealed nonetheless. It follows that after each degree disappears due to the %0asins of the lower ones, it ascends to Rosh de Atik and conceals itself there. %0a%0aHowever, Guf de Atik, from its Peh downward, is located inside all the other %0aPartzufim of the world of Atzilut, i.e., it is attainable by them. Thus, by clothing %0ain the Partzufim of the world of Atzilut, Atik shines through them and gives the %0aLight to them and to all the lower worlds of BYA. And any Light that shines on %0acreation during the 6,000 years comes only from Guf de Atik, and not from some %0aother spiritual object. %0a%0aWe usually say that whatever is present in the Rosh of a Partzuf manifests in %0aits Guf. This is also true with regard to all the Partzufim of the world of AK and %0aall the other Partzufim in all the worlds, except in Partzuf Atik! This is so because %0aAtik remains in Tzimtzum Aleph and descends down to our world. However, with %0aregard to other Partzufim below it, Atik acts as though it is in T^imt^um Bet, making %0aa special Zivug on itself and the Light from it descends to the lower worlds. %0a%0aThe Light that comes to revive the worlds is called "sustenance" or Ohr %0aHassadim, and the Light that comes to stimulate the growth of the Partzufim, %0ato turn a small Partzuf (Katnut) into a big one (Gadlut) is called Ohr Hochma. %0aBoth these Lights originate in Guf de Atik. Ohr Hochma, which makes a Partzuf %0abig, is called the Light that elevates the Partzuf, for the lying position is called %0aIbur (embryo), the sitting position is called Katnut (small), and the standing %0aposition— Gadlut (big). %0a%0a94. He slew two— Ariel and Moav (Moab). Two Holy Temples existed thanks %0ato Atik and received from it: the First Temple and the Second Temple. Since %0aAtik's disappearance, the process that stemmed from Above had ceased. It is %0aas though he struck and destroyed them. %0a%0aOnly Malchut de Malchut must be corrected, and nothing else. All the other %0aproperties do not require correction. This Malchut de Malchut is Malchut of Olam %0aEin Sof (the World of Infinity), Behina Dalet, Nukva de ZA or Partzuf BON— the %0aCreator's only creation, the will to receive (pleasure) for oneself. It is this desire %0athat caused the breaking of the Kelim (vessels)— the sin of Adam. %0a%0aAnd all the work of the righteous during the 6,000 years concerns the %0acorrection of Malchut, so she becomes precisely as she was prior to the breaking %0aof the Kelim and the sin of Adam. As a result, the great Zivug on T^imt^um Aleph %0ain Rosh de Atik will be revealed. The Light of this Zivug enables man to sort and %0aseparate his impure desires from the pure ones, and thus forever rid himself of %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Donkey Driver %0a%0a%0a%0a245 %0a%0a%0a%0athe impure egoistic forces. This is exactly what Prophet Yeshayahu writes about: %0a"He will eradicate death forever" (Yeshayahu, 25:8). %0a%0aSince Malchut, Partzuf BON of the world of Atzilut, is completely corrected %0aalready and does not require any further corrections, her Partzuf BON ascends %0ato the level of Partzuf SAG of the world of AK. Thus, Malchut completely attains %0athe properties of Bina. %0a%0aHowever, meanwhile, after the great Zivug in Atilc, but before the ascent of %0aPartzuf BON to SAG, the Light of Atilc stops shining. As a result, the two Temples %0awere destroyed. The two temples are the two Lights of Hochma: the Light of AVI, %0aOhr Hochma de Haya that shines in the First Temple, and the Light of YESHSUT, %0aOhr Neshama that shines in the Second Temple. And all the Light that Israel %0areceived from Atilc disappears. %0a%0aHowever, all these destructions and disappearances of Light are corrections %0aand milestones on the path to deliverance and complete correction. They signify %0anot devastation, but creation of perfection, as they are precisely those final %0acorrections that bring BON back to SAG. %0a%0aSince all the roots and sources of what transpires in this world exist in the %0aspiritual realm, and must all manifest once in our world, every spiritual ro %0amust "touch" its branch in our world, and it does not matter when this oo %0aIn the spiritual world, everything unfolds in accordance with a strict cause-an %0aeffect process, whereas in our world those same consequences can manifest at a %0acompletely different time. %0a%0aAn example of this is the destruction of the First and the Second Temples. %0aWhile this event has already transpired in our world, in the spiritual world it %0aoccurs only when the last stage of correction is attained. Due to the complexity %0aof time-transcending notions, we will examine this matter in another book. %0aHowever, one way or another, only our inner spiritual properties can become the %0aTemple in which we will feel the Creator and in which He will forever dwell! %0a%0aAt the end of correction, Ohr Haya and Ohr Neshama will be called the %0aFirst and the Second Temples, respectively. Also, until the end of correction, %0aOhr Haya, which is received on the Zivug of Malchut and included in Yesod, is %0aled Shahhat (Sabbath), while Ohr Neshama is called Hoi (weekdays). As wi %0aere is absolutely no connection between these Lights and the %0a%0a%0a%0aAfter the destruction of the spiritual Temples (the disappearance of Light), %0athey will be recreated from Above by the screen of Bina, called "Heaven." This is %0abecause the screen of Partzuf SAG is a property of absolute mercy and is completely %0a%0a%0a%0a246 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aunrestricted in its actions, desiring only to bestow and refrain from receiving Ohr %0aHochma. Thus, it is beyond the influence of any restrictions and limitations. %0a%0aAs a result of this Zivug, the two Temples will be restored forever, and "the %0aLight of the Moon (Malchut) shall be as the Light of the Sun (Bina)" (Yeshayahu, %0a30:26). The Light of Bina, which is now the Light of ZA (called "the sun"), %0awill be seven times more powerful, as ZAT de Atik. From there, this Light will %0adescend to AVI and create the first seven days of creation, for ZA (the sun) will %0abecome like AB and contain the Light of Guf de Atik. Malchut will become like %0aZA and receive his Light, the Light of the sun. %0a%0aAt the end of correction, a Zivug on Malchut herself (the primordial, but %0acorrected egoism) will transpire, and all the particular Zivugim that were made %0aon all the Lights through the 6,000 years (made not on Malchut, but on her %0ainclusion in Yesod) will thereby disappear. %0a%0aThe Temple will be restored from Heaven, for Bina herself does not wish to %0areceive Ohr Hochma. And it will not occur because she cannot, but because she %0adoes not want to. This degree is referred to as "in the hands of Heaven." For %0aexample, it is written in the blessing on the new moon: "Life, which contains %0athe fear of Heaven, and the fear of sinning." This life is above our reasoning and %0adesires, for it is said that faith must be "above reason"; otherwise, sins will ensue. %0a%0aThus, one desires nothing more than to go by faith above his reason and %0adesires, for he is afraid to sin. However, there exists an even Higher Degree: when %0ahe no longer fears sinning, as he now has a screen, but still prefers to proceed by %0afaith above reason and desires, for he yearns to be dissolved in the Upper One. %0a%0aThe reason for the Light's disappearance from Guf de Atik prior to these %0acorrections is that the two Malchu^ot (Bina and Malchut, called SAG and BON) %0ano longer exist. After the great Zivug of Atik, BON were annulled along with %0athe screen of SAG, as Guf de Atik contains the connection between Bina and %0aMalchut, designed for their interaction during the 6,000 years. %0a%0aAs a result of such interaction between Bina and Malchut, an opportunity %0aarises to partially, gradually correct Malchut. In this mutual Zivug with Malchut, %0awhich is merged with Bina (Bina's properties), Atik first creates AA and then all %0athe other Partzufim of the worlds of Atzilut and BYA. %0a%0aAnd since the screen of Malchut (Masach de BON) now disappears, the %0ascreen of Bina (Masach de SAG) disappears as well, as they are merged together. %0aIn the absence of Malchut and the screen, this Zivug stops, and all the Light of %0aGuf de Atik emanating from this Zivug on the mutual screen of Malchut and %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Donkey Driver %0a%0a%0a%0a247 %0a%0a%0a%0aBina disappears. Therefore, all the Light that descended from its Guf (called %0aTemples) disappeared. %0a%0aIn Rosh de Atik there is a Zivug on Malchut of Tzimtzum Aleph. Merged with %0aBina and existing for 6,000 years, the screen of Malchut disappears. As a result, %0athe Light disappears as well. Malchut has yet to ascend to SAG to receive her %0aperfection, as there is still no new Light. This complete absence of Light is called %0a"destruction." However, Malchut then receives the Light of AVI, and the worlds %0aof BYA merge with the world of Atzilut. %0a%0a95. And the Holy Throne (Malchut) is overthrown. Hence, the prophet %0aYechezkel (Ezekiel) wrote, "I am in exile," signifying that the degree called %0a"I," which is Malchut, is in exile. Why? "By the river Kevar." Kevar %0a(already) is the river that had already existed, but has now disappeared. As it %0ais written, "The river is destroyed and dried up." It was "destroyed" in the %0afirst Temple and "dried up" in the second. Hence, it is written: "He struck %0aand destroyed both, Ariel and Moav." Moav (or Mi Aw) means "from the %0aHeavenly Father." They were all destroyed for Him, and all the Light that %0ashone upon Israel disappeared. %0a%0aThe word Kursa, derived from the word Kisse (throne) or Kissuy (cover) %0asignifies the combination of the properties of Malchut and Bina, which leads %0ato the Light descending to BYA during the 6,000 years. The Holy Throne is %0aoverthrown, because the screen of Bina (Kisse) has been annulled, as it is said, "I %0aam in exile," where "I" designates Malchut. %0a%0aThe entire spiritual complex is structured like a ladder, where Malchut of %0athe Upper Partzuf becomes (descends to) the Keter of the lower one. This is also %0aindicated in the names: Malchut is called "I" (Ani = Aleph-Nun-Yod) and Keter is %0acalled "no" (Ein = Aleph-Yod-Nun), as it is completely unattainable. Only that %0awhich is perceived within Malchut can be attained; hence, it is called "I." %0a%0aOnly Malckut of the Upper Partzuf acts as a link between the Partzufim: the %0aUpper One makes a Zivug on its Malchut, creates Ohr Hozer, and receives (clothes) %0athe Upper Light within it, and then Malchut of the Upper One descends to the %0alower Partzuf in the form of Ohr Hozer. This state of the Upper One clothing in %0athe lower one is called the exile of the Upper One, for the Zivug with the Upper %0aLight disappears from it, and the Upper Light disappears from all the Partzufim. %0aAnd the river dries up— the corrected screen is called the "river," for it causes the %0aUpper Light's descent to the lower ones. %0a%0aHowever, now that the screen (river) disappears, the descent of the Upper %0aLight disappears as well. The destruction of the river in the First Temple causes %0a%0a%0a%0a248 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0athe disappearance of Ohr Haya; the river in the Second Temple dries up, and %0aOhr Neshama vanishes along with it. The river in the First Temple is destroyed %0abecause the Zivug in AVI is stopped; the Light in YESHSUT is exhausted, and %0athe river in the Second Temple dries up. %0a%0aThe source of Ohr Haya and Neshama is Aba, called the "Heavenly Father," for %0ahe shines in ZA, called "Heaven," with the Light that elevates ZON to YESHSUT %0a(the Second Temple) and to AVI (the First Temple). Because the Light stops %0ashining from Guf de Atik, all of the Light descending to Israel disappears. This %0arefers not only to the Light of the two Temples, but to all of the Light shining %0aupon Israel, including Ohr VAK and the Light in the worlds of BYA. %0a%0a96. Further, He descended and struck the lion. Initially, when this river %0arolled its waters down, Israel was in a state of perfection, for they offered %0aup gifts and sacrifices to atone for their sins and to save their souls. Then, the %0aimage of a lion would descend from Above, and they would see it on the %0aaltar as it trampled the bodies of the sacrifices, devouring them, and all the %0adogs (all those who slander Israel) would fall to silence. %0a%0aThe fire that consumes the sacrifices laid on the Temple altar resembled %0aa lion, and towered over the sacrifices, like a lion (Talmud, Yoma, 21:2), and %0athat fire burned the sacrifices laid down by the sons of Israel. However, this is a %0acorporeal image that a regular person perceives in our world. %0a%0aBut we shall follow our higher analysis and detach ourselves from this %0acorporeal image; we will explain the action in the spiritual world that this %0alanguage actually alludes to. All the languages in the Torah, including that which %0adescribes a rather corporeal image of sacrifice, speak only of spiritual actions. %0aThe most precise language for the description of these actions is the language of %0aKabbalah. However, this language is clear only to those who have ascended to %0athe spiritual worlds and see both the roots, i.e., the events that transpire in the %0aspiritual worlds, as well as their corporeal consequences. %0a%0aBefore the Light of Atik disappeared, when the Upper Light still shone upon %0aIsrael, like a river rolling its waters, Israel was in a state of perfection: by means %0aof sacrifice, it raised its MAN (request), thus evoking a Zivug on its screen, and %0aMAD (the Light, abundance) descends on it. As a result of these actions, it grew %0acloser to the Heavenly Father, and all the impure forces distanced from it, for it %0apurified its souls, and purification signifies distancing from the impure forces %0a(desires), the way a soiled garment is cleansed from dirt. %0a%0aHence, the Hebrew word for sacrifice is Korban, derived from the word %0aKarov (near). Thus, sacrifice signifies a person tearing away a part of his inner %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Donkey Driver %0a%0a%0a%0a249 %0a%0a%0a%0aanimal egoism for the sake of drawing closer to the Creator. This is what brings %0aIsrael closer to their Heavenly Father. %0a%0aAnd since Israel existed in perfection and raised MAN for the Creator's %0apleasure alone, its MAN would ascend to Bina. The Light of Bina is called Ohr %0aHassadim, and its form resembles the image of a lion, like the property of bestowal, %0aHesed. This means that the lion-Bina receives Israel's good desires and deeds. And %0ait was seen how Bina consumes Israel's MAN— Ohr Hassadim descends from Bina %0aonto this MAN, like a lion trampling his prey (MAN) and devouring it. %0a%0aA lion devouring its prey is the principal aspect of sacrifice, for it signifies %0araising MAN to strengthen a screen and create Ohr Hozer. And since the %0amagnitude of the received Ohr Yashar is determined by the magnitude (height) %0aof Ohr Hozer, which creates the screen, it follows that existence and growth of %0aOhr Yashar is dependent on the Ohr Hozer. The greater the Ohr Hozer, the greater %0athe descending Ohr Yashar becomes. %0a%0aIn other words, to the extent that every one of us desires to "bestow," he %0aevokes a corresponding response from Above, from the root of his soul. And just %0aas in our world a living being's life and strength depend on nutrition (it simply dies %0awithout it), the Upper Light depends on the Light reflected by the screen. When it %0astops, the Upper Light disappears from the Partzuf, i.e., man stops feeling it. %0a%0aThe Upper Light descends from Bina as Ohr Yashar (called a "lion"), i.e., in %0athe form of "bestowal," in accordance with Bina 's nature. And man sees (feels!) %0ahow Ohr Yashar clothes in Ohr Hozer, which ascends from its sacrifice (rejection %0aof egoism), the lion's nourishment. %0a%0aIt devours its prey and thereby grows: the extent of Israel's perfection and %0atheir ability to offer sacrifices, to "bestow," determines the magnitude of their %0aMAN and the force with which the Ohr Yashar strikes the screen, which reflects %0athe Direct Light (pleasure) from below upwards with all its might. Moreover, it %0adoes so in great fear: for what if it fails to reflect the Light and desires to enjoy %0athe Light of this commandment selfishly? %0a%0aThat is precisely where one's work lies. It is called "faith above reason," for %0ait must rise above one's reason (egoism) and intellect. Conversely, those who %0aceive inner confidence that it is enough to advance within one's nature ar %0acred still," a pure inanimate (non-developing) being, as such re %0a%0a%0a%0aTherefore, if the height of Ohr Hozer is great, it is defined as a lion that tears %0aand devours its prey, as a victor, for it grows and ascends to a higher spiritual %0alevel thanks to the efforts of the lower one (man). %0a%0a%0a%0a250 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aThe impure force, the selfish will to receive pleasure is called "a dog," as it %0ais written: "The leech has two daughters (who demand): Give-give." (Mishley, %0a30:15). They bark like a dog, and demand (to receive) both this world and the %0anext. And the Higher One ascends, the stronger this impure force, called Klipa, %0abecomes. And its strongest part corresponds to Ohr Yechida, opposite the lion %0adevouring its prey). %0a%0aThe lion represents mercy and bestowal, unwillingness to receive anything %0afor oneself. As it is written in The Ethics of the Fathers, 95: "A Chassid, the merciful %0arighteous one, says, 'What's yours is yours, and what's mine is yours,'" so is the %0aimpure force (dog) aimed wholly at reception, and has no aspiration to bestow. %0aAs it is said in the Talmud (Bava Batra, 10:2), "The righteous among the nations %0aof the world: all their mercy is for themselves alone;" hence, they are connected %0ato the impure force of a dog. (Under no circumstances should any of this be %0ainterpreted literally, for, as it was repeatedly explained, the whole of the Kabbalah %0aspeaks only of man's-prototype. Israel is one's inner aspiration to the Creator, %0aand Goy (a gentile) signifies egoism (regardless of and unrelated to one's origin). %0aRelate this to the above-mentioned corporeal and spiritual Temples, where there %0ais no connection between rocks and spiritual objects. It is also unclear to the %0auninitiated why altruism is the property of a lion, while a dog, a loyal animal, is %0athe root of egoism and impurity). %0a%0aIt is therefore said that when Israel was perfect, it acquired the property of a %0alion, and all the dogs left it be, for it gave Malchut the strength to raise Ohr Hozer %0ato great heights (devoured its prey, like a victor), and the impure force, like a %0adog, was afraid to come near it, and would hide in fear of the lion. %0a%0a97. Yet, when sins increased, he descended to the lower degrees and slew the %0alion. This was because the lion refused to give up its prey as before, and this %0ais as though he killed it. Therefore, he struck the lion and threw it into a pit, %0ato the Evil Side (according to his understanding). The Evil Side saw this and %0asent a dog to devour the sacrifices from the altar in the lion's stead. What is %0athe name of that lion? And what is the nickname of that dog? Baladan is its %0aname; Baladan is formed by the words Bal'Adam, where the letter Mem is %0areplaced by Nun, for he is not a human being at all, but a dog, and his face is %0alike a muzzle of a dog. %0a%0a("He" refers to Benayahu Ben Yehoyada Ben Ish Chai, Rav Paalim u Mekabtziel, %0ain whom the degree of Atik, all of the Light, shines all at once.) Due to the %0adisappearance of the screens of Malchut (BON) and Bina (SAG), Israel below could %0ano longer raise MAN (the will to "bestow," the screen, the lion's nourishment). %0aThe Zivug stopped, and the Upper Light (lion) disappeared in its Root Above. %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Donkey Driver %0a%0a%0a%0a251 %0a%0a%0a%0a"Threw it into a pit"— the root of the desire to receive for one's own sake %0ais in the eyes, as Rashi said: "The eye sees, and the heart burns with desire" %0a(The weekly portion Shlach). This will to receive for oneself is called an "empty, %0awaterless pit" (Beresheet, 37:24). The Upper Light does not fill it. Although it is %0aempty, it is unworthy of being a vessel for the Light, as it is written: "He and I %0acannot dwell in the same abode" (Talmud, Suta, 5). %0a%0aThus, the lion was thrown into a pit, for it was struck before the eyes of %0athe impure egoistic force, called an "empty, waterless pit." And these pits now %0aemerge from their hideouts and reveal their power, and in place of a lion appears %0aa barking dog. %0a%0aZA-MA = 45 is called Adam = Aleph + Dalet + Mem = 1 + 4 + 40 = 45, when %0ahe receives the Light from Bina. The property of Bina is bestowal. Hence, it is %0awritten: "Man is your name" (Talmud, Yevamot, 61), referring only to those who %0aattain the property of bestowal, but not to the others, of whom it is said: "Even %0atheir mercy is only for their profit" (Talmud, Bava Batra, 10:2), and who are %0atherefore called Baladan (Bal-Adan). %0a%0a98. On a day of snow, on the day misfortunes descend from the Supernal %0aCourt Above, it is written, "Her household shall not fear snow," that is, the %0aSupernal Court, called "snow." For her household is clothed twofold, and can %0athereby endure a strong fire. So the book says. %0a%0aStrictness, judgment (Din) or restriction imposed on the use of egoism in the %0amale part is called "snow" that stems from the Supernal Court. These restrictions %0aare very powerful, but are mitigated below the Chazeh, where Malchut receives %0athem. Nulcva describes these restrictions in the following way: "Surround me %0awith roses," (Shir HaShirim, 2) referring to two fires: the Upper— Bina, and the %0alower, her own— Malchut. %0a%0aAfter Malchut acquires these two fires, she weakens the strictness of the cold %0asnow with her fire. Hence, it is written in Shir HaShirim (Song of Songs) that %0aher household shall not fear snow (the Supernal Court), i.e., the restrictions %0aimposed on the male part, for her household is clothed twofold. In other words, %0aon the contrary, the snow helps her withstand the heat of her fire. And only %0anow that the screen and Zivug are gone, and the two fires are no more, the %0arestrictions of the snow return. %0a%0a99. What is written next? "And he struck an Egyptian." This refers to a secret: %0aevery time Israel sinned, the Creator would conceal Himself and restrict them %0afrom receiving all the goodness and all the Light that He shone upon them. %0a"He struck an Egyptian." "He" refers to Moshe, the Light that shines upon %0aIsrael. For in Egypt he was born, grew up, and attained the Supernal Light. %0a%0a%0a%0a252 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Torah speaks not of man, but of the Light that disappeared and %0aconcealed itself. Hence, it is defined as "slain." Gone is the great Light, with %0awhich Moshe shone upon Israel. And this Light is called the "Egyptian," for %0ain Egypt Moshe was born, grew up, and attained the great Supernal Light, the %0aLight that delivered Israel from Egypt. %0a%0a100. A man of mirror. It is written, mirror and man, as it is written, a Godly %0aman, the husband of that mirror, of the Creator's glory, Malchut. For with %0athis degree he merited ruling over the entire land in all of his desire— a feat %0aunmatched by any other. %0a%0aThe difference between Moshe and the other prophets is that Moshe is the %0afoundation of ZA, as he constructs and passes the Light from ZA to Malchut, %0awhereas the other prophets are the foundation of Malchut, and receive from %0aher. Hence, it is written of him: "Godly man," the husband of Malchut, called %0athe "Creator's greatness." And why is Moshe called the husband of Malchut 7 . %0aBecause he attained the level of ZA and gives the Light to Malchut. Therefore, it %0ais written that his attainments are beyond anyone else's, for the other prophets %0areceive from Malchut, and are therefore ruled by her. %0a%0aHe who attains Malchut receives from her. The degree called Moshe means %0athat he who attains it gives the Light to Malchut, instead of receiving from her. %0aYet, how can this be? How can one possibly rise above Malchut if all our souls %0aoriginate from her and exist in the worlds of BYA? This indicates the state of %0aascent above Malchut, which is how Moshe ascends to Bina. %0a%0a101. This is the Creator's staff that was delivered to him, as it is written, %0a"With the Creator's staff in my hand." This is the staff that was created on %0athe evening of the sixth day of the creation, before Shabbat. And His Holy %0aName is contained in it. And with this staff Moshe sinned by striking it %0atwice against the rock. The Creator said to him: "Moshe, it is not for this %0apurpose that I have not given you My staff; thus, it will no longer be in your %0apossession henceforth." %0a%0aThe words "evening" and "twilight" signify the state of mitigation of Malchut 's %0astrictness by the properties of Bina to an extent that it becomes impossible to %0adistinguish Malchut from Bina. This is because on Shahhat, Malchut ascends to %0aAVI and becomes Bina. However, on the twilight of Shabbat, Malchut is not %0ayet Bina, but is no longer Malchut (everything in the book speaks only of the %0aproperties of spiritual objects, for nothing but desires exists in the spiritual %0aworlds. Only in our world are desires clothed in physical bodies). %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Donkey Driver %0a%0a%0a%0a253 %0a%0a%0a%0aHence, it is said that ten things were created in the twilight, when there is no %0adistinction between the thing itself and its origin, Bina or Malchut, for Malchut %0aherself shows no distinction. And such is the property of the staff that was created %0ain the twilight, before the world's first Shabbat. Hence, it possesses the holy (special) %0aproperty of the Creator's name, an allusion to the properties of Bina, from which %0aholiness (altruism) descends. And Malchut is ready to receive this holiness. %0a%0aAnd these two properties of Bina and Malchut are contained in the Creator's %0astaff, utterly indistinguishable from one another, for they were created in the %0atwilight. Hence, with the help of this staff, i.e., by means of the property of %0auniting Malchut with Bina, all the fortunes and wonders, all of the Light can be %0abrought to Israel, for this is the purpose behind the Light's descent from Bina %0ato Malchut. With the help of this property (the staff), Moshe merited an ascent %0ato Bina, up to the degree of "Godly man." Therefore, the staff is called the %0aCreator's staff, according to the name of Bina. %0a%0aMalchut is called Tzur (rock), and upon ascending to Bina, she is called Sela %0a(another name for a rock). The inner Zivug between ZON (ZA and Malchut) in %0athe state of their ascent to AVI, when Nukva uses Ima's Kelim, is called "speech." %0aThe outer Zivug between ZON, when they are in their own place, is called "Zivug %0ade Hakaa" (a Zivug by Striking). %0a%0aIt is hence written to Moshe in the weekly Torah portion Bashalach: "You %0ashall strike the rock (Tzur), and it shall bring forth water" (Shemot, 17:6), for %0aa Zivug de Hakaa occurs within Malchut herself. However, it is written in the %0aweekly portion Chulcat: "Speak ye unto the rock before all eyes, that it give forth %0aits water" (Bamidbar, 20:8), for the "rock" is in Bina, and the Zivug within her is %0acalled "speech." %0a%0aAnd herein lies the sin of Moshe: he struck twice: in addition to first %0astriking the Tzur, he struck the Sela, which lacks the strike, and only has a %0aZivug in the form of speech. Since there is no distinction in the Creator's staff, %0aand it is unclear whether it refers to Malchut or to Bina, he also applied it to %0aSela-Bina. And the Creator told him that the staff was given to him to use with %0aTzur, but not with Sela. %0a%0a102. At once He descended to him in strictness and wrenched the staff from %0athe Egyptian's hand, for the moment the staff was taken from him, it was %0ataken for good. And he was killed by it: because of the sin of striking the rock %0awith the staff, he died and did not enter the Holy Land. And that Light was %0aconcealed from Israel. %0a%0a%0a%0a254 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aIt was already mentioned in item 94 that as a result of a great Zivug in %0aAtik, only BON were supposed to disappear, but not SAG, for BON could have %0aimmediately risen and forever become like SAG. However, as SAG and BON %0awere merged, SAG disappeared together with BON. %0a%0aThe Light of Moshe disappeared from Israel for the same reason— because %0ahe committed an even greater sin and harmed the union of BON and SAG by %0astriking the Sela. Hence, harsh judgment descended upon him, which refers to %0athe disappearance of the Light of SAG. Indeed, SAG is no longer connected to %0aBON in any way, and the annulment of BON has no influence on it. %0a%0aThis is the meaning of what is written in Psalms: "He resembled those who %0adraw axes at a copse of trees, but now all of his adornments are smashed by %0ahatchets and axes" (Tehilim, 74:5). Due to Malchut's ascent to Bina, and her %0acorrection there, Malchut is like a "copse of trees," for SAG, too, is annulled by %0athe merging with BON, Malchut's ascent, as if struck with "hatchets and axes." %0a%0aHence, it is written that the staff was taken from the Egyptian, and will %0anever return to him, for the staff refers to Malchut. So the Light disappears for %0agood, because BON renews itself afterwards and becomes SAG forever. Thus, it %0ais no longer necessary to use the staff for striking. %0a%0aIt is written in this regard that he was slain by the same staff, for had he %0abeen careful and used it only once— striking the Tzur, but not the Sela— SAG %0awould not have been annulled together with BON, and he would not have died. %0aInstead, he would have immediately risen to SAG. %0a%0aThis is why it is written that Moshe shall not enter the Holy Land, Israel, as %0aIsrael is BON in the state of ascent to SAG, and it is called the Holy Land, for %0athe Light of Bina (called the Holy Light) shines in it. However, until the end of %0acorrection arrives, there are still ascents and descents, which cause destructions %0a(disappearance of the Light) and revelations (shining of the Light). But at the %0aend of correction, BON will remain within SAG permanently as Eretz Israel, and %0athere shall be no more exiles from it. %0a%0a103. "The most respected of the thirty" refers to the Upper One that receives %0afrom Above and passes downward, one that receives and brings closer. %0aHowever, he does not go to the first three, but they come to him and give to %0ahim wholeheartedly, but he does not come to them. %0a%0aGAR (HBD) are called "thirty," as each of the three Sefirot HBD consists of %0aten, which amounts to thirty. And their Light shines in all of the 6,000 years. %0aThe soul of Benayahu appears out of the great Zivug of Atik, which accumulates %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Donkey Driver %0a%0a%0a%0a255 %0a%0a%0a%0aall the Zivugim during the 6,000 years. Hence, it is called Rav Paalim (performing %0amany actions) and Mekabtziel (gathering all into one degree-Part^u/, called %0aBenayahu Ben Yehoyada). %0a%0aTherefore, he receives the Light of all of the Supernal Thirty, which descends %0ato his soul. Indeed, he consists of particular Zivugim that have transpired through %0athe 6,000 years, which he gathers into one. And, although they give him the %0abest of their properties wholeheartedly, he still cannot draw closer to them and %0asubsequently receive from them. This is because the disappearance of the screen %0ain ZON made the screen in SAG disappear as well. Hence, he cannot come to %0athem, raise MAN, and receive from them further. %0a%0a104. Despite not being considered one of them, David heard the meaning %0athat is never detached from the heart, for they can never be separated. David %0apaid attention with all his heart, but he did not pay attention to David. For by %0athe praises, hymns, and mercy that the moon offers the sun, the moon draws %0athe sun closer so as to be with it. %0a%0aDavid is Malchut; Malchut comes from the word Melech (King). Therefore, %0aDavid is King, for his properties are the properties of Malchut (kingdom). %0aAnd this is the fourth leg (support) of GAR. Hence, it is written that although %0ahe cannot be together with the thirty (GAR), he nonetheless clings to these %0aproperties, and never detaches himself from them. %0a%0aThis is because Malchut's entire perfection is revealed in him, for it stems %0afrom the great Zivug of Atik, which destroys all the impure forces of BON, as it is %0asaid: "He destroys evil forever." %0a%0aTherefore, David resolved to never part with it again, for it is his perfection. %0aHowever, Benayahu Ben Yehoyada paid no attention to David, as David is the %0afourth support of GAR. Hence, it is as though he is unable to receive from GAR. %0aAnd since he cannot receive from David, he pays no attention to him. %0a%0aWith the help of the MAN of Malchut (called Se'ara— stormy wind), which %0ais raised to ZA (called "Heaven"), as a result of the hymns, praises, and mercy, %0aMalchut receives the Light of Benayahu Ben Yehoyada's soul, which is absolute %0aperfection, and merges with it for all eternity. %0a%0a105. Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Aba fell down on their faces before him and could %0anot see him anymore, then rose and went in every direction, but could not %0asee him. They sat and wept, and could not even speak to one another. Then, %0aRabbi Aba said, "It is true what we have learned, that the Torah accompanies %0athe righteous on all their paths. The righteous of the other world come to %0a%0a%0a%0a256 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0athem to reveal to them the secrets of the Torah. And this must have been %0aRabbi Hamnuna-Saba, who came to us from the other world to reveal these %0asecrets to us. But before we could recognize him, he vanished." They rose and %0awanted to lead their donkeys on, but could not. They repeatedly tried to goad %0athe donkeys, but still they could not move. They grew frightened and left their %0adonkeys behind. And to this day this place is called "the place of donkeys." %0a%0aBecause they could not bear such a powerful Light, which was revealed to %0athem upon the disclosure of those secrets, they fell (Katnut) and then rose (Gadlut), %0afor it was so unbearable. After they merited receiving from it such a great degree, %0athis Light disappeared at once and did not reappear, and they could not attain it %0aanymore. Hence, they wept (a kind of Katnut) out of great grief that they had lost %0asuch exalted attainment, and they could not speak (absence of Kelim). %0a%0aThe bitterness of their loss made them realize that it was the degree of %0aRabbi Hamnuna-Saba himself, and not lower, as they had mistakenly thought %0abefore. The forces that they received from the soul of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba are %0acalled "donkeys," with which they can raise MAN, the request to attain Higher %0aDegrees, Haya and Yechida. %0a%0aIn other words, the soul is a spiritual force of Light; like a pulling force of %0aa donkey that helps overcome egoistic desires and move from place to place in %0athe spiritual world, onto a Higher Degree. To raise MAN means to feel what is %0alacking and what needs to be attained— this is what man's work is all about. %0a%0aSuch is the work of a righteous soul— it helps man by lifting him up onto %0ahis donkey (egoism) and taking the lead (pulling) in order to illuminate (give %0astrength) for him the path of the righteous. And now, when its role has been %0acompleted, this soul disappears, although they would have very much liked to %0acontinue ascending and riding its donkeys, i.e., they wished to raise MAN anew %0ato return and attain once more. %0a%0aHowever, they could no longer receive the strength to raise MAN. Thus, %0athey were struck by fear and left their donkeys in that place, which is hence %0acalled "the place of donkeys," for they could not use them any longer. %0a%0a106. Rabbi Elazar opened and said: "Oh, how great is Your goodness, which %0aYou have hidden away for those who fear You! (Tehilim, 31:20). How infinite %0ais the goodness that the Creator shall bestow on humankind in the future, %0aon those sin-fearing, exalted righteous, who study the Torah as they arrive %0aat that Upper World." %0a%0aThe words "great goodness" refer to Gadlut, the attainment of the Light of %0aGAR. For the basis of a Partzuf is its VAK— the amount of Light necessary for its %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Donkey Driver %0a%0a%0a%0a257 %0a%0a%0a%0aexistence, received from the Zivug of AVI, who make this Zivug and emit Ohr %0aHassadim, necessary to sustain the worlds. And all the extra Light, necessary %0afor existence, is called GAR or Ohr Hochma— the additional, delectable and %0agreat Light. %0a%0aThis Ohr Hochma, the Light of GAR, stems from Bina, which is called "the %0aworld to come." It is clothed in Ohr Hassadim that emerges from a Zivug of the %0aSefira Yesod (Chai Olamim— life of the worlds), and from there descends to the %0arighteous who fear to sin. %0a%0aThe Zivug of AVI, when they are at the degree of Bina, gives Ohr Hassadim %0ato ZA for the sustenance of the worlds. However, when AVI ascend to AA and %0abeget new souls by their Zivug, their Zivug is inconstant, as it emits Ohr Hochma, %0acalled "new souls." %0a%0a107. The name "great goodness" can be further described as containing all %0athe secrets of the Supernal wisdom, which descend from ZA to Malchut. %0aThere is a great tree, called ZA or Rav (great, strong), and there is a small tree, %0aMalchut, which grows from it. And it is elevated to the Highest Firmament. %0a%0aIn addition to the attainment of the Light of GAR, there is also the inner %0apart of the Supernal wisdom with its secrets, which become revealed in the %0aZivug of Atik at the completion of the 6,000 years, the end of correction. MA %0adesignates the lower world, Malchut. The great and strong tree is ZA in the state %0aof ascent to Partzuf AB, as in this state he receives Ohr Hochma, and Hochma %0asignifies strength (not "reason— strength" but the strength of Ohr Hochma lies in %0athe fact that it allows one to go against reason, in defiance of common sense, in %0afaith above reason). %0a%0aHowever, when ZA is in his place, he is simply called "a tree," for he lacks %0aOhr Hochma and has only VAK, Ohr Hassadim. Malchut is also called a tree and %0agrows together with ZA; ZA ascends to Aba, to the utmost height, to the Supernal %0aFirmament— Atik. %0a%0a108. The "great goodness" is the Light that was created on the first day of %0acreation and concealed so as to be revealed in the future for the righteous %0ain the other world. Your Deeds are the Supernal Garden of Eden, which the %0aCreator has created by His act. %0a%0aThe Light that was created on the first day of creation is the Light in which %0aAdam saw from one end of the world to the other. Hence, the word "Light" is %0aused five times in the Torah's description of the first day of creation. This Light is %0aintended for the righteous in the world to come, for it is concealed in Yesod de Aha %0aand in Yesod de Ima, which are collectively called "righteousness and justice." %0a%0a%0a%0a258 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0a(In Hebrew, the words Tzedek— justice and Tzadik— righteous/just have the %0asame root. This name is given to one who attains the Creator's governance and %0asees that His governance is just; hence, he justifies all of the Creator's actions, %0aand is thus called righteous. The other meaning of the word 'righteous' refers to %0aman's belief that the Creator is righteous, because in spirituality, one assumes the %0aname of the degree one has attained. If he attains that the Creator is righteous %0aby receiving this knowledge from the degree onto which he ascends, then he is %0aalready called by the name of that degree.) %0a%0aOhr Hochma can be received only in "precious garments," called %0arighteousness and justice, that is, only with these intentions. The above excerpt %0aspeaks of an open action, implying unrestricted diffusion of Light, as it will %0abe after the end of all the corrections. In the Torah, such a state is called "the %0aSupernal Garden of Eden." %0a%0aIn the meantime, only the complete and perfect righteous ones, the souls %0aof Benayahu Ben Yehoyada and others that merited reception of Light from the %0agreat Zivug of Atik, gather all the Light of the 6,000 years. These souls' place of %0arest is referred to as the Garden of Eden. %0a%0aThere exists the lower Garden of Eden of earth, which is VAK, and the %0aSupernal one, GAR. All the souls dwell in the lower Garden of Eden, and only %0aon new moons and Sabbaths do they ascend to the Supernal Garden of Eden, %0aand then return to their place. However, there are individual, special persons %0a(souls), whose place is in the Supernal Garden of Eden. These are the souls of %0awhich Rabbi Shimon says: "I saw them ascending, but their numbers were few." %0a%0a109. All the righteous stand in the lower Garden of Eden, clothed in precious %0aadornments, similar in quality and form to those which they wore in this %0aworld, meaning in the same form as people in this world and according to %0aman's actions in this world. They stand there and fly away through the air, %0aascend to the Assembly in the Supernal Garden of Eden, fly there and bathe %0ain the dew of the pure river of Apharsemon (persimmon), then come down %0aand fly below in the lower Garden of Eden. %0a%0aThe main difference between GAR and ZAT with regard to both Partzufim %0aand souls is that GAR (KHB) do not need the garment of Hassadim. They can %0areceive Ohr Hochma as it is. However, Partzufim of VAK and the souls born %0afrom ZON, whose basis is VAK (Ohr Hochma clothed in Ohr Hassadim), can only %0areceive Ohr Hochma when it is clothes in Ohr Hassadim. %0a%0aThe Ruach de Tzadikim (spirit of the righteous) in the lower Garden of Eden %0ais clothed in Ohr Hassadim, just as human souls in this world. And with the help %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Donkey Driver %0a%0a%0a%0a259 %0a%0a%0a%0aof these precious garments, they can ascend to the Supernal Garden of Eden %0aand there receive Ohr Hochma. Afterwards, they return to their place in the %0alower Garden of Eden, for that is their permanent place. %0a%0aThey ascend by the power of Ohr Hassadim, called "air," and fly to the %0aSupernal Garden of Eden to receive Ohr Hochma, called the river of Apharsemon. %0aHowever, they cannot stay there, so they immediately descend from the Supernal %0aGarden of Eden to the lower. The Zohar compares them to human souls, for %0aboth the Upper and the lower human souls need to receive the garment of Ohr %0aHassadim in order to correct themselves and ascend. %0a%0a110. And sometimes these righteous appear as people in order to perform %0amiracles, like celestial angels, just as we have seen the luminescence of the %0aUpper Light, but did not merit to see and discover the wisdom's great secrets. %0a%0aDID NOT MERIT TO DISCOVER THE WISDOM'S GREAT SECRETS- %0afor the donkey driver had left them and disappeared. There are special souls %0athat abide in the Supernal Garden of Eden. They have risen so high that the %0asouls from the lower Garden of Eden ascend to them only on new moons %0aand Sabbaths, and, being unable to stay there, immediately descend to their %0apermanent place. However, they are nonetheless similar to human souls, which %0adescend from the Supernal Garden of Eden to this world and meet people, just %0alike the angels that seldom descend to this world. %0a%0aNow they have seen the Light of the Supernal Luminary, the Light of Rabbi %0aHamnuna-Saba that descended on them from the highest point, the Supernal %0aGarden of Eden, and was revealed before them in this world (while they are still %0aliving in this world). %0a%0aAS PEOPLE refers to the souls that abide in the lower Garden of Eden, %0awhich have the form of people, and the Light of the Supernal Garden of Eden %0ainfluences them. They can receive this Light during their ascent on new moons %0aand Sabbaths, whereupon they merit meeting the souls of the Supernal Garden %0aof Eden, and then descend to their permanent place. %0a%0aHowever, one may also say that the words AS PEOPLE refer to the people %0aof our corporeal world, while the souls from the Supernal Garden of Eden %0asometimes descend to this world and, like exalted angels, appear before the eyes %0aof the righteous. %0a%0a111. Rabbi Aba opened and said: "And he who is doomed said to his wife, %0a'We shall die, for I have seen the Creator.' Even though he was not aware of %0ahis actions, as it is written, 'He did not know that it was an angel'; however, %0a%0a%0a%0a260 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0asince it is written, 'Man shall not see Me and live,' we know that he has %0adied. And we have merited this great Light to accompany us, and the world %0aexists because the Creator Himself sent him to us, to reveal the secrets of His %0aSupernal wisdom to us. How joyous is our share!" %0a%0aWhen the angel saw him who was doomed, he did not yet have the proper %0alevel of attainment; thus, the angel was unwilling to reveal his name. Yet, %0aalthough he did not know and did not attain him, he still feared the words, %0a"Man shall not see Me and live" (Shemot, 33:20). %0a%0aBut we have merited complete attainment, for we came to know his name, %0aRabbi Hamnuna-Saba. And we live and exist in this world. It is therefore clear %0athat the degree of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba is called "Show me Your glory" (Shemot, %0a33:18), Moshe's request of the Creator. %0a%0aBut the Creator replied: "You cannot see My face, for man shall not see Me %0aand live." From this we see that they have attained more than Moshe. This state %0ais described by sages as, "There was no prophet more exalted than Moshe, but %0athere was a sage" (Yalkut Shimoni, the end). It is also written: "A sage is preferred %0ato a prophet" (Talmud, Bava Batra, 12:1). Thus, they have spiritually ascended to %0amerit the appearance of such an exalted soul, while still being in this world. %0a%0a112. They walked and came to a mountain. The sun had set. The branches %0aof the tree on that mountain started rattling and singing. As they were still %0awalking, they heard a resounding voice proclaim, "Sons of the Holy Creator, %0adispersed among the living in this world, illuminated by the sons of the %0aAssembly, gather in your places and rejoice with your Creator in the Torah." %0aThey grew frightened and stopped, then sat down. %0a%0a"They came to a mountain" refers to the words of King David, who said %0a(Tehilim, 24:3): "Who shall ascend the mountain of the Lord, and who shall %0astand in His holy place?" meaning who is worthy of it? After they climbed %0athe mountain, the sun had set (the Light left the Partzuf). But they heard %0asomething from the trees, as it is written: "Then shall all the trees of the wood %0asing for joy" (Tehilim, 96:12). %0a%0aThey heard a voice that told them to return to their place, rejoice in the %0aCreator and His Torah, and descend from the mountain. And it calls them by %0athe name of that High Degree, which they've achieved. But it hints that people %0aare not worthy of being at that degree and in this world simultaneously. Yet, %0aalthough they were frightened, they remained on the mountain, sat down, and %0adid not move. "Grew frightened," "stopped," and "sat down" are the spiritual %0astates of the Partzuf. %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Donkey Driver %0a%0a%0a%0a261 %0a%0a%0a%0aWe see how The Zohar explains the path of the righteous, those who cross %0athe Machsom (the barrier that separates our world from the spiritual) and start %0aascending the rungs of the spiritual ladder. This path is diverse, and each book %0aof the Torah describes it in its own way: the language of Kabbalah, legends, %0ajudicial laws, historical accounts of the Pentateuch, etc.. The Zohar draws a vivid %0apicture for us— like a guidebook for those who will find themselves in the place %0aof these exalted travelers in the spiritual world. Once there, you will see for %0ayourselves what is implied by such notions as "mountain," "tree," and "voice." %0aThen The Zohar will become your true guidebook! %0a%0aIt is impossible to provide a more detailed description of the Partzufim, i.e., %0aan inner perception of one who ascends spiritually. This is because the reader %0amust first have certain analogous sensations of his own. If one could see only %0aonce what the described content (or something similar) really means, one would %0abe able to clearly imagine what it speaks of. %0a%0aIt is the same in our world: even if we have never been to a certain country, %0awe can imagine what others describe to us by analogy with what we already %0aknow. But in this case, there is no analogy. One who sees the spiritual world %0afor the first time realizes how wrong all of his previous visualizations have been! %0aHence, we can say nothing about many of the states described in The Zohar. %0a%0a113. Meanwhile, a voice called out again, "O, mighty rocks, great hammers of %0athunder, Bina stands upon a pillar, so enter and assemble." At that moment, %0athey heard the mighty voice of thousands of trees, which was saying, "The %0aCreator's voice breaks the cedars." Both Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Aba fell %0adown on their faces. Great fear fell upon them. They rose hastily and left, not %0ahearing anything else, then came down the mountain and kept on walking. %0a%0aIt was previously said that they could not load their donkeys, meaning that %0athey were unable to raise MAN, because Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba had already %0acompleted his helping mission. This is why they lost the power of their donkeys, %0aand could not continue using them to raise MAN and merit Higher Degrees. %0a%0aTherefore, Rabbi Elazar said earlier that they did not merit seeing and %0aattaining the secrets of the Supernal wisdom. The fact is that after they attained %0athe level of Yechida, i.e., revealed the soul of Benayahu Ben Yehoyada with the %0ahelp of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba, the disappearance of the screen (Masach) of BON %0acaused the loss of Masach de SAG. Hence, they could no longer raise MAN. %0a%0aThe Light stopped descending to them from Guf de Atik specifically to %0agive them the opportunity, or rather the strength to recreate Masach de SAG. %0a%0a%0a%0a262 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aConsequently, BON will become like SAG, they will resume raising MAN, and %0awill once more be able to ascend from degree to degree. %0a%0aHence, as soon as both Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Aba left their donkeys, %0athey lost strength to raise MAN in order to bring BON back to the level of SAG. %0aHowever, the voice proclaimed that they are as strong as rock and thunder, for %0aso far they have endured all the trials. And they will gather strength to endure %0athe mighty rocks and to overcome all the obstacles as before, until they obliterate %0athese obstacles, like great hammers of thunder crashing down from Above. %0a%0aBina, though herself colorless, is called "the source of colors." This is because %0ashe is all mercy, whereas all the other properties originate specifically from her %0aby enduring all the trials, like rocks. From all this, Bina receives new forms, %0ahence she received the powers of a new screen onto which emerge all the new %0adegrees and Partzufim. %0a%0aTogether with the voice that informed them of Bina 's new powers, they %0aheard another voice, "The Creator's voice breaks the cedars" (Tehilim, 29:5), %0awhich let them know that all the cedars (obstacles) on their path to higher %0aattainments have been removed. This gave them strength to climb down the %0amountain and continue their path onto Higher Degrees. %0a%0a114. Upon reaching the house of Rabbi Yosi, the son of Rabbi Shimon %0aBen Yosi Ben Lakunya, they saw Rabbi Shimon BarYochai. They rejoiced. %0aRabbi Shimon rejoiced, too. He said to them, "You have traveled this path %0aof Heavenly signs and wonders correctly, for as I was sleeping, I saw you and %0aBenayahu Ben Yehoyada, who was sending you two crowns with an old man, %0aso as to adorn you. I am certain that the Creator was on this path too, because %0aI see how your faces have changed." Rabbi Yosi said, "Truly, it is said that a %0asage is preferred to a prophet." Rabbi Elazar came and put his head on the %0aknees of his father, Rabbi Shimon, and told him of what had happened. %0a%0aHere The Zohar gives an allegorical explanation of two states: first, they merited %0aattaining the Light of SAG (called Rabbi Yosi) once more, and secondly, now %0aSAG and AB join in a constant Zivug. We see this from their meeting with Rabbi %0aShimon, who signifies Ohr Hochma. In other words, they merited their BON %0areturning and becoming like SAG in its constant and eternal Zivug with AB. %0a%0aBenayahu Ben Yehoyada sent them two crowns through Rabbi Hamnuna- %0aSaba: Ohr Yechida, called Benayahu Ben Yehoyada himself, and a new Light AB- %0aSAG, which they have just attained. This Light also came to them by the powers %0aof Benayahu Ben Yehoyada as a reward for overcoming all the trials, thanks to %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Donkey Driver %0a%0a%0a%0a263 %0a%0a%0a%0awhich they, of all others, merited this degree, which is emanated from the great %0aLight of his soul. %0a%0aHence, it follows that he sent them two crowns. However, all these descents %0aon their spiritual path were not failures; rather, the Creator Himself was %0aleading them to that High Degree, which they have now attained. This is why %0ait is written: I AM CERTAIN THAT THE CREATOR WAS ON THIS PATH %0a(with you). However, HOW YOUR FACES HAVE CHANGED, for you have %0aattained something else, described by the phrase, A SAGE IS PREFERRED %0aTO A PROPHET. %0a%0a115. Rabbi Shimon was frightened and wept. He said, "I have heard the %0aCreator and I am awed." This verse was spoken by the prophet Havakuk %0a(Habakkuk), when he saw his death and his resurrection by Elisha. Why was %0ahe named Havakuk? Because it is written that at around this time there would %0abe a HOWEK-ET-a son will be embraced. For Havakuk was the son of the %0aShunamit. And there were two embraces: one from the mother and one from %0aElisha, as it is written, "He put his mouth to his." %0a%0aFirst, it is unclear how the prophet Elisha could pass a seed in his blessing %0ato the Shunamit, for this seed cannot exist (procreate). Indeed, Elisha was the %0agreatest prophet after Moshe and his soul came from the Supernal Garden of %0aEden. Hence, his BON (in Hebrew, the words Ben— son and BON are spelled the %0asame way: Bet-Nun) was already absolutely pure and perfect. %0a%0aTherefore, when he passed his son to her, he tied him to the male side, %0awhereas he tied Havakuk only to the female side. And since the female side, %0aNukva, is closer to the impure force, it clung itself to him, and he died. Thus, %0athe reason for his death lies in the exalted level of the prophet, for his BON is %0apure and free from the clinging of impure forces. %0a%0aHence, the prophet prayed: "The Creator has hidden it from me and had not %0atold me!" (Melachim II, 4:27). In other words, he had not the slightest clue that he %0acould die by being connected only to BON. That is why it was necessary to return, %0arevive, and attach him to the Upper World, to the resurrection of the dead. %0a%0aThe essence of the embryo is the white (Ohr Hochma) in it, as it is written %0a(Talmud, Nidah, 31:1) that Aha (father) is Hochma, for Hochma is called %0a"white," as it is said, "He made everything with Hochma (wisdom)" (Tehilim, %0a104). However, there is also a need for clothing in Ohr Hassadim, the intention %0a"for the Creator's sake," as it is impossible to receive Ohr Hochma, the Light %0aof Wisdom, attainment and delight, without the clothing of Ohr Hassadim, %0awithout an altruistic intention. %0a%0a%0a%0a264 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aSo the mother must provide the red, the screen, which provides Ohr %0aHassadim, required for the clothing of Ohr Hochma in it. As a result of the Ohr %0aHassadim embracing (clothing, enveloping) Ohr Hochma in itself, an embryo can %0aexist. And here the embryo's entire embrace came only from the mother, the %0aShunamit, i.e., only from the female side (BON). %0a%0aHence, when Elisha revived him, he gave him the white (Hochma) and the %0ared (Hassadim) once more. It follows that it was Elisha himself who embraced %0ahim the second time. It is hence said that there were two Havakuks (from the %0aword Hihuk— embrace): one from the mother and the other from Elisha. %0a%0a116. 1 have discovered in the book of King Solomon that the name Havakuk %0aconsists of seventy-two names. Elisha created it with words. Each word consists %0aof three letters, for the letters of the alphabet that the Father confirmed to him %0ainitially flew away when he died. But Elisha embraced him and confirmed in %0ahim all these letters in his seventy-two names. In all, there are 216 letters in his %0aseventy-two names, three letters in each. %0a%0aThe embryo is built of 216 = RYU (Reish = 200 + Yod =10 + Vav = 6) letters, %0adesignating Ohr Hochma, which descends to YESHSUT. This means that the %0aembryo has RYU letters, which amounts to the Gematria of RE'IYAH = Reish- %0aAleph-Yod'Hey, i.e., the Light of vision. Re'iyah means vision in Hebrew, and %0avision is possible only in Ohr Hochma, for "seeing" means "attaining," and the %0aLight of the eyes is the Light of Hochma. %0a%0aWhen a growing Partzuf attains Gadlut, receives the clothing of Ohr Hassadim %0aof the Upper World from AVI, and RYU clothe in Ohr Hassadim, this Partzuf is %0acalled AB (72) names, as each three letters join into one and RYU = 216 letters %0aturn into AB = seventy-two groups with three letters in each group, or AB = %0aseventy-two names. %0a%0aWhen Ohr Hassadim, the clothing of the Partzuf, comes only from the lower %0aworld, it is defined as RYU = 216 letters. And when it attains AB, Hassadim %0aof the Upper World, each three letters form a group, and this results in AB = %0aseventy-two names, as it is written, HE CONFIRMED IN HIM ALL THESE %0aLETTERS. When Elisha revived Havakuk, the son of the Shunamit, he created %0athe name Havakuk, AB = seventy-two letters from RYU = 216, for he gave him %0aOhr Hassadim of the Upper World from AB. %0a%0aBecause of it, all 216 letters made groups of three and formed three lines %0afrom Above downwards: right, left and middle. A cell made of three letters— the %0aright, left, and middle lines, situated horizontally (referring to the same screen %0aand type of Kli)— is regarded as one. Therefore, AB (seventy-two) letters is used %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Donkey Driver %0a%0a%0a%0a265 %0a%0a%0a%0ainstead of AB (seventy-two) names, because each letter is considered to include %0athree, merged into one. When Ohr Hochma enters these seventy-two cells, the %0aPartzuf is called AB and is said to have the complete Light of Hochma. %0a%0a%0a%0a%0aOne cell. In all, there are 72 %0asuch 3-letter cells (names) %0a%0a%0a%0aOhr Hassadim is the Light that brings peace in the state of the Partzuf at a %0agiven moment, for its property is not to wish anything for itself, but to bestow. %0aHowever, Ohr Hassadim received from the lower world is merely comfort "for %0awant of something better," whereas Ohr Hassadim received from the Upper World %0acreates such a powerful property of "bestowal" that the Partzuf receives Ohr Hochma, %0athereby showing that although it has Ohr Hochma, it still prefers Ohr Hassadim. %0a%0aThis is similar to a person in our world, who says that he needs nothing. Yet, %0athere is a distinction: does he say this in a state when he has nothing and can %0ahave everything he wants, but still wishes to restrict himself to bare essentials %0aand to give away the rest? %0a%0aTherefore, when the growing Partzuf (the son— BON) had only Ohr Hassadim %0afrom the lower world, it could not receive Ohr Hochma in it, and was thus called %0aRYU letters. But since the impure forces still cling to them and tempt the Partzuf %0ato receive Ohr Hochma for itself, Ohr Hochma cannot be clothed within them. %0a%0aThese RYU letters that Havakuk had since the day of his birth FLEW AWAY %0aWHEN HE DIED. Hence, it was essential to give him RYU letters and AB %0anames once more. And Elisha did just that by HIS SPIRIT, for he was obliged %0a%0a%0a%0a266 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0ato recreate in him RYU letters in order to combine them into AB cells with %0athe help of the Upper Hassadim (combine everything into three lines), when %0aeverything unites into AB names. %0a%0a117. Elisha confirmed all of these letters in the soul of Havakuk so as to revive %0ahim by the letters of the seventy-two names. And he called him Havakuk, for that %0ais his complete name, which describes all of his properties, as it alludes to two %0aHavakuks and to the 216 letters of the Holy Name, as the Qematria (numerical %0avalue) of the name Havakuk is 216, from which the seventy-two names were %0aformed. By AB names he revived him and brought his spirit back, and by RYU %0aletters he revived his body and let it live. This is why he is called Havakuk. %0a%0aHavakuk = Chet + Bet + Kuf + Vav + Kuf = 8 + 2 + 100 + 6 + 100 = 216. %0aThe word Havakuk indicates two embraces (Hibukim, plural for Hibuk). Like %0aall Hebrew names, it refers to the property of its bearer. For instance, Yaakov %0ais derived from "Akev" ("got around" Esav), and Avraham signifies Av —father, %0aAm— of the nation). %0a%0aThe first embrace came from Ima, but it did not yet allow Ohr Hochma into %0athe Partzuf, into RYU letters, for the impure force clings to the red in Ima. But %0athen Elisha embraced him with Hassadim of the Upper World that came from %0aAVI. This united the letters into groups (names), and Ohr Hochma entered and %0afilled these names permanently, since the impure force cannot cling to Hassadim %0aof the Upper World. %0a%0aAs in the above example, even if all the Ohr Hochma were to be offered, the %0aPartzuf, upon receiving protection in the form of a desire for Hassadim of the %0aUpper World, receives such great strength (desire) to bestow that it never wants %0aHochma. This is precisely why Hochma can fill it for all eternity. %0a%0aTherefore, the name Havakuk denotes two Chihukim (embraces): one from %0athe mother and one from Elisha, thereby imparting him with perfection from all %0asides: from both the Ohr Hochma and the Ohr Hassadim. "Embraces" signify Ohr %0aHassadim that stems from AVI, and Ohr Hochma received within Ohr Hassadim %0ais called "the secrets of RYU." %0a%0aIt is hence written that HE REVIVED HIS SPIRIT BY AB NAMES AND %0aHIS BODY BY RYU LETTERS. And he was revived by Elisha's embrace, for %0aRYU letters had formed names, that is, the three lines, in which Ohr Hochma %0acould be received, thanks to the reception of Ohr Hassadim from AVI (the %0aUpper World). %0a%0aThe impure forces (man's egoistic desires) cannot attack in this Light. %0aHence, death (the result of receiving Ohr Hochma for oneself) does not exist. %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Donkey Driver %0a%0a%0a%0a267 %0a%0a%0a%0aSubsequently, he receives Ohr Hochma, which yields the complete correction %0aof his Guf. %0a%0aHowever, the Partzuf '(son of the Shunamit) had RYU letters from the moment %0aof birth, and they left him when he died. Then why is he called Havakuk (two %0aembraces)? After all, the first embrace of Ima (mother) left him the moment %0aof his death, and Elisha revived him from death by embracing him only once. %0aThus, does he not contain only the embrace of Elisha? %0a%0aThe thing is that Elisha has given him nothing new at the time of resurrection, %0aexcept for the embrace, the Light from the Supernal Ima— SAG, whose Light %0aevokes the resurrection of the dead. And RYU letters were simply revived by his %0alower mother— BON. These are the same RYU of BON with which he was born. %0aOtherwise, it would have been an entirely new soul, of which one would not %0ahave been able to say that it was dead and then resurrected. %0a%0aTherefore, now he truly has two embraces, for the first one has now been %0arevived as well, when BON ascended to SAG. And since BON is in the place of %0aSAG, his Hassadim are regarded as those of the Supernal Mother. They completely %0aneutralize the impure forces and death, for their properties (desires) are only of %0abestowal, which the impure force cannot bear. Thus, they can no longer tempt %0aman. This is why he is called Havakuk, after the action of the two embraces. %0a%0a118. He said, "I have heard the Creator and I am awed by His Name." I %0ahave heard of what I had and have had a taste of the other world at the %0amoment of death, before Elisha resurrected him, and I am awed. He began %0aasking for mercy for his soul. He said, "O, Creator, the deeds that You %0ahave performed for me throughout the years were my life." And whoever %0aconnects to the past years (the name of the Sefirot of Atik), connects to life. %0aThroughout the years, bestow life upon the degree that has no life of its %0aown, upon Malchut de Malchut. %0a%0aHis fear comes from the past, previous states, for now he has become perfect %0aon all his sides, and therefore fear has no place. This fear remained from the past, %0awhen he left the world. This describes the state between death and resurrection. %0aHowever, he continues receiving fear from the past state, so it would help him %0acreate a screen for raising MAN. It is precisely this fear from past times (states) %0athat stimulates him to raise MAN (request for mercy). %0a%0aThis is the secret of the future screen, after BON becomes SAG. For then %0a"He will eradicate death forever" (Yeshayahu, 25:8), and there will be no force %0aevoking fear of death and suffering or able to cause harm to one's purity and %0aholiness. Hence, there will be no need to shun, no one to beware of or avoid. %0a%0a%0a%0a268 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aSo if one has attained such an exalted spiritual state, where could he possibly %0aacquire fear? After all, he will not be able to ascend without it! Only if he takes %0afear from his past states! For the Partzuf retains the memories, records, recollec- %0ations of past states, even after its ascent to SAG, when BON become like SAG. %0a%0aIf not for the recollections of fear from the past states, the Partzuf would %0anot have been able to create a screen in a state when it has nothing left to fear. %0aWhile explaining this, Rabbi Shimon told them of Havakuk, to teach them how %0ato acquire fear, just as Havakuk did by taking fear from the past. %0a%0aTHE DEEDS THAT YOU HAVE PERFORMED... THROUGHOUT %0aTHE YEARS... WERE MY LIFE-because he lived through two periods: the %0ayears preceding his death and the years following his resurrection. Between %0athese two periods, there was a state of exiting this world, death (during which %0ahe existed in the other world). That is to say, because I remember the time of %0amy death, I thereby connect to life of the Upper World, which Elisha bestowed %0aby resurrecting me. %0a%0aZATde Atik is called the "past (sometimes ancient) years," since they receive %0atheir Light from Malchut of the world of AK, Malchut of Tzimtzum Aleph. %0aHowever, ZAT de Atik do not shine upon the lower Partzufim and worlds with %0atheir Light of Tzimtzum Aleph. ZAT de Atik shine downward during the 6,000 %0ayears with diminished Light, restricting it according to the laws of Tzimtzum Bet. %0aOnly at the end of correction will they begin to pass down all of their Light. It is %0awritten in the Torah that the Light that Atik had passed during the 6,000 years %0ais designated with the small letter Hey in the word Avraham. %0a%0aHowever, because Havakuk's death has purified him completely, since at the %0aend of correction he merited merging with the "past years" of Atik, he received %0athe required strength in Elisha's embraces and resurrection. It is hence written %0athat after he has purified himself and felt fear at the moment of his death, the %0apower of this fear enabled him to establish contact with ZAT de Atik and receive %0athe Light called "eternal life." %0a%0aFor having purified himself through death, BON received complete %0acorrection, upon ascending and becoming SAG at the time of death. Subsequently, %0ait reaches the degree of Malchut de Malchut, a Zivug on which can only be made %0aat the end of correction, and attains this degree, the Light of his life. %0a%0a119. Rabbi Shimon wept and said: "And I have seen from the Creator what %0aI have heard." He raised his hands above his head, and said: "But you have %0amerited seeing Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba, the Light of the Torah, face to face, %0awhile I have not." He fell on his face and saw him who uproots mountains and %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Donkey Driver %0a%0a%0a%0a269 %0a%0a%0a%0alights candles in the Temple of the King (Mashiach). He said to him, "Rabbi, %0ain the other world we shall be neighbors with the heads of the assemblies %0abefore the Creator." From here on, he called his son Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi %0aAba by the name Pnei'el (the face of God), as it is written: "For I have seen %0athe Creator face to face." %0a%0aHe praised himself for using the same fear from the past, just like Proph- %0aet Havakuk. %0a%0aAll corrections are already ready and waiting in the hall of the King %0a(Mashiach), down to the very last detail. They must all be revealed at the end of %0aall corrections, with the appearance of the King. And the souls in that hall are %0athose who merited completion of their individual corrections, for there is an %0aindividual correction and a general one. %0a%0aMalchut de Malchut is the only creation, and it is divided into parts called %0asouls. These parts merge with people of our world, and each of them, while %0aexisting within man, must attain one's own correction, i.e., gradually replace %0aone's properties (desires) with those of the Creator. This is considered the soul's %0aindividual or personal correction. So then, the souls that have attained their %0aindividual correction reach and exist in the state called "abiding in the hall of %0athe King-Mashiach." %0a%0aThe Light in that hall (the Light of the Torah), also called Hamnuna-Saba, %0acompletely liberates man from the impure forces, i.e., purifies him from all his %0aprimordial egoistic desires and corrects Malchut de Malchut, which "appears to %0athe righteous as a high mountain" (Talmud, Sota, 52). This correction is made %0aby creating a new SAG-like screen with the purpose of raising MAN (the request %0afor final correction). MAN is called Me'orei Esh (sparkles of fire), as it is written: %0a"Man's soul is the Creator's candle" (Mishley, 20:27). %0a%0aThe light of the sun designates the Light's descent, MAD, just as sunlight %0adescends upon us from Above, whereas a fire's flame signifies Ohr Hozer %0athat rises from below upwards, like candlelight. The Zohar therefore says that %0athese two corrections, aimed at destroying the impure forces and ascending to %0alight the candles in the hall of the King-Mashiach, are in the hands of Rabbi %0aHamnuna-Saba. %0a%0aAnd the perfect righteous in need of these two final corrections merit %0areceiving them only through revealing the soul of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba. And %0ahe stated that they (the disciples of Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Aba) will merit the %0ahonor of serving in the hall of the King-Mashiach after their death, and will %0abecome his neighbors and the heads of the Creator's Assembly.

Rabbi Elazar, the son of Rabbi Shimon, was on his way to visit his father- %0a%3c in-law, Rabbi Yosi, the son of Lakunya, and Rabbi Aba accompanied him. A %0a%3c man followed behind them, driving their donkeys. Rabbi Aba said, "Let us %0a%3c open the gates of the Torah, as it is time to correct our path." %0a%3c %0a%3c In Aramaic, the language in which The Zohar was written, "driver" means %0a%3c "one who pricks." This is because the donkey driver's function amounts to %0a%3c forcing the donkeys to move by pricking them with the edge of his stick. %0a%3c %0a%3c 75. Rabbi Elazar opened and said, "It is written: My Sabbaths you are to %0a%3c observe." Let us see: the Creator created the world in six days. And each day %0a%3c would reveal His deeds, and gave strength to that day. When did He reveal %0a%3c His deeds and give them strength? On the fourth day of creation, for the first %0a%3c three days were concealed completely, and would not be revealed. The fourth %0a%3c day arrived, and He revealed the deeds and forces of all the days. %0a%3c %0a%3c The phrase "He gave that day strength" means that He gave everything to %0a%3c the day of Shabbat. For the six days are Sefirot HGT NHY that reveal on Shabbat %0a%3c (Malchut) the work and the forces that were carried out during these days. %0a%3c %0a%3c Yet, if the deeds of all the days are concealed, and only reveal at their end, %0a%3c on Shabbat, then why is it written that they are revealed on the fourth day of %0a%3c creation? The thing is that Malchut is called both the fourth and the seventh days: %0a%3c she is fourth with regard to the first three Sefirot HGT, called the "Patriarchs" %0a%3c (Hesed is Avraham, Gevura is Yitzchak, and Tifferet is Yaakov), and seventh with %0a%3c regard to the six Sefirot, after three additional Sefirot, called the "Sons": Netzah is %0a%3c Moshe, Hod is Aaron, and Yesod is Yosef. %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut herself is King David— the day of Sbabbat. Malchut grows and gradually %0a%3c accumulates her corrections in two principal stages, called Ibur (conception). %0a%3c The first three days correspond to Ibur Aleph (the first conception), and the %0a%3c %0a%3c 223 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 224 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c second three days correspond to Ibur Bet (the second conception, Gadlut, the %0a%3c reception of Ohr Hochma). %0a%3c %0a%3c In other words, Malchut is gradually created from Sefirot HGT of ZA in three %0a%3c days, and forms on the fourth day as the Sefira Net^ah de ZA. Hence, at this stage in %0a%3c her growth, Malchut is referred to as fourth from the Patriarchs. And then Shabbat %0a%3c comes to our land (Malchut is called both land/ earth and Shabbat). The state that %0a%3c Malchut achieves as a result of her growth from Sefirot NHY of ZA is called Shabbat %0a%3c on earth. And this state she attains as the seventh Sefira from all the Sefirot of ZA. %0a%3c %0a%3c The first three days are not revealed in Malchut, for as long as a Partzuf %0a%3c lacks Malchut, it is defined as concealed or secret. The weekdays are defined so. %0a%3c And when Malchut completely attains the degree where she stands, she thereby %0a%3c attains herself. This state is defined as Shabbat. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, if Malchut receives from the six Sefirot de ZA, shouldn't they (the six %0a%3c weekdays) be more important than Malchut-Shabbat (inferior Sefira with regard %0a%3c to those she receives from)? %0a%3c %0a%3c The truth is that all the weekdays constitute individual degrees of correction %0a%3c (weekdays' work) that are devoid of Malchut. Hence, they are called "weekdays," %0a%3c for a Partzuf without Malchut is considered a closed degree, unable to receive %0a%3c Light, and is therefore deprived of holiness. After all, in the absence of Malchut, %0a%3c there is no GAR of the Light, Ohr Hochma. And only when Malchut is revealed %0a%3c in the Partzuf (signifying the arrival of Shabbat) is the holiness of the ENTIRE %0a%3c degree revealed; ENTIRE, because all six days receive what they have earned, %0a%3c and the Light shines in all the weekdays thanks to them alone. %0a%3c %0a%3c When the first three days of creation HGT emerged before the emergence %0a%3c of Malchut, these three Sefirot were devoid of Light, i.e., they were concealed. %0a%3c And when Malchut appeared, the fourth day arrived, and the importance and %0a%3c holiness of all four days manifested, for Malchut complements the entire degree, %0a%3c and the perfection of creation becomes revealed thanks to her. In the language %0a%3c of Kabbalah, this is described in the following way: all six days of creation are %0a%3c Ohr Hochma, and Shabbat is Ohr Hassadim. Ohr Hochma is present on weekdays, %0a%3c but cannot shine for lack of Ohr Hassadim, and when Ohr Hassadim arrives on %0a%3c Shabbat, all the Ohr Hochma shines thanks to this Ohr Hassadim of Shabbat. %0a%3c %0a%3c 76. There is fire, water and air— HQT — the three first days of creation. %0a%3c Although they are the initial Supernal foundations of all that will follow, %0a%3c their actions are not revealed until the earth, meaning Malchut, reveals them. %0a%3c Only then does the work of each of the Supernal foundations reveal itself. %0a%3c Hence, the power of the first three days is revealed only on the fourth. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Donkey Driver %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 225 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 77. However, the third day may be better described as one that reveals the %0a%3c creation of the first three days, as it is written: LET THE EARTH BRING %0a%3c FORTH GRASS. That is to say, the revelation of the earth's (Malchut's) deeds %0a%3c already took place on the third day. Yet, although it was written on the third %0a%3c day, Tifferet, it was actually the fourth day, Malchut. Malchut joined the %0a%3c third day, for Tifferet and Malchut are inseparable. And then the fourth day %0a%3c revealed its deeds— to elucidate the work of each and every one of HQT, for %0a%3c the fourth day is the "fourth leg" of the Supernal Throne (the Sefira Bind), %0a%3c whose four legs are HQTM (Hesed, Qevura, Tifferet, and Malchut). %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut reveals the holiness and spiritual power of the three days. Therefore, %0a%3c Malchut ascended and joined the third day, so as to reveal by the unity of these %0a%3c three days (three lines) their exalted spiritual essence. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is hence written that the deed is revealed on the fourth day, for Malchut %0a%3c alone completes their revelation at the conclusion of the three days. And %0a%3c afterwards, three more days emerge, which are NHY. After the revelation of %0a%3c the holiness of the first three days, HGT, called the "Patriarchs," which are the %0a%3c foundation of ZA, ZA enters them (his main part is manifested), and the time %0a%3c comes for the Sons (NHY, the last three of the six days of creation) to be born. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is why it is written that ZA is defined as the fourth leg of the throne %0a%3c of Bina, and the throne remains imperfect and incomplete until its fourth leg %0a%3c (foundation) manifests. Indeed, ZA is incomplete until Malchut manifests within %0a%3c him, i.e., until the fourth day arrives. And only after the emergence of Malchut %0a%3c can ZA father the Sons— the three final days of creation. %0a%3c %0a%3c 78. All of the actions of all the Sefirot, both on the first three days of creation, %0a%3c HQT, and on the last three, NHY, are dependent on the day of Shabbat, %0a%3c Malchut, QAR of the entire degree of ZA and its perfection. Hence, it is %0a%3c written, AND THE CREATOR RESTED ON THE SEVENTH DAY, %0a%3c SHABBAT. This refers to the fourth leg of the throne, as the seventh and the %0a%3c fourth days are both Malchut. Only the fourth day is Malchut that includes %0a%3c the Sefira Tifferet of ZA, from his chest upwards. Also, the seventh day is %0a%3c Malchut of the entire ZA, and they merge together face to face in a Zivug. %0a%3c %0a%3c Although the first three days, HGT, end with the fourth day (the result of %0a%3c their actions), they nonetheless remain not entirely complete; their perfection %0a%3c manifests only on Shabbat, together with the last three days, NHY. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is therefore written that Sbabbat is the fourth leg of the throne, even %0a%3c though it is the seventh day, for, although it emerges after the Sons, it also %0a%3c completes the deeds of the Patriarchs, as the first three days did not complete %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 226 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c their corrections on the fourth day, and a seventh day, Shabbat, is needed to %0a%3c complete them. %0a%3c %0a%3c The reason for this is that on the fourth day, Malchut is in the state of %0a%3c Katnut, called the small phase of the Moon. As a result, the Moon (Malchut) %0a%3c returns to the state called Shabbat, when all the Light of all the days of creation %0a%3c manifest and shine within her. This is why the Light of the first three days of %0a%3c creation becomes revealed only on Shabbat. %0a%3c %0a%3c 79. Yet, if Shabbat is Malchut, then why does the Torah say, "My Sabbaths %0a%3c you are to observe," implying two? It is written of the two parts of Shabbat'. %0a%3c the night (Malchut) and the day (ZA) that shines in Malchut. Thus, there %0a%3c is no division between them, for they merge face to face in a Zivug, and are %0a%3c therefore called two Sabbaths. %0a%3c %0a%3c He asks: two Malchuyot (plural for Malchut) of the fourth and the seventh days %0a%3c are completely separate, as is written, "You shall keep my Sabbaths," implying %0a%3c two? Yet, when we clarify that the fourth day manifests in perfection only on the %0a%3c seventh day, it becomes clear that there is only one Shabbat. But what is meant %0a%3c here is ZA and Malchut that shine in the holiness of Shabbat, for this day is the %0a%3c male, bestowing part (Zachar) that manifests in the female part (Malchut or Nukva). %0a%3c Hence, they are called Sabbaths (plural). However, by merging in perfection, they %0a%3c become a single whole. As a result, ZA also assumes the name of Shabbat. %0a%3c %0a%3c 80. Following behind them with the donkeys, the donkey driver asked: "Why %0a%3c is it said, 'You shall fear sanctity?'" They replied: "This refers to the sanctity of %0a%3c Shabbat." The donkey driver asked: "What is the sanctity of Shabbat?" They %0a%3c replied: "It is the sanctity that descends from Above, from AVI." He said to %0a%3c them, "If that is so, then Shabbatot (plural for Shabbat) are without sanctity, %0a%3c for sanctity descends on it from Above, from AVI." Rabbi Aba answered him: %0a%3c "It is indeed so." And it is said: "And call Shabbat a delight, a holy day dedicated %0a%3c to the Creator." Shabbat and a holy day are mentioned separately. The donkey %0a%3c driver asked: "If that is so, then what does a holy day mean to the Creator?" %0a%3c He replied: "That is when sanctity descends from Above, from ZA, and fills %0a%3c Shabbat, Malchut." The donkey driver objected, "But if sanctity descends %0a%3c from Above, then Shabbat itself is not a holy day. And yet, it is written, You %0a%3c shall sanctify Shabbat,' meaning Shabbat itself." Rabbi Elazar said to Rabbi %0a%3c Aba, "Leave this man alone, for there is much wisdom in him, of which we do %0a%3c not know." So he said to the donkey driver, "Speak, and we shall listen." %0a%3c %0a%3c The donkey driver's question is this: if Shabbat is ZA, then why is it described %0a%3c as holy? After all, sanctity is the property of AVI, and only AVI are called holy. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Donkey Driver %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 227 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, he objected that Shabbat should be separated from sanctity. Shabbat (ZA) %0a%3c is not holiness in itself, but because it receives holiness from Above, from AVI. %0a%3c That, which ZA receives from AVI is what is called the Creator's holiness. %0a%3c %0a%3c 81. The donkey driver opened and said, "It is written: Shabbatot, i.e., there %0a%3c are usually two. And this alludes to the border of Shabbat, which is 2,000 %0a%3c AmaH (cubits) in each direction from the city. This is why the word Et was %0a%3c added before the word Shabbatot, which designates the plural form— both the %0a%3c Upper Shabbat and the lower Shabbat joining into one." %0a%3c %0a%3c Although it is said: "Man shall not leave his place on the seventh day" %0a%3c (Shemot, 16), i.e., the singular form is used, in many places in the Torah, the %0a%3c word Et is used; for example, in the sentence: "Et 2,000 Amah in each direction %0a%3c from its place." The word Et, consisting of the first and the last letters of the %0a%3c alphabet, Aleph and Tav, designates Malchut entering into union with ZA, %0a%3c which signifies the state of Shabbat; hence, the Light of AVI becomes revealed %0a%3c and shines (as a supplementary luminescence) upon ZON. This is because AVI %0a%3c are called "two thousand," and so the word Et is present here to designate a %0a%3c supplement of Light to Shabbat. %0a%3c %0a%3c There exist a Shabbat Above and a Shabbat below: the Upper Shabbat is Partzuf %0a%3c Tvuna, and the lower part of Partzuf Bina, whereas the lower Shabbat is Partzuf %0a%3c Malchut, Nukva de ZA of the world of Atzilut. In the world of Atzilut, Partzuf Bina %0a%3c is divided into two Partzuf im: the Upper Part of Bina is called Partzuf AVI and the %0a%3c lower part of Bina (the part where she receives the Light from the Upper Part %0a%3c so as to pass it to ZA) is called Partzuf YESHSUT (Israel Saba ve Tvuna) or simply %0a%3c Tvuna. The relationship between Bina-AVI and Tvuna is similar to that of ZA %0a%3c and Malchut. Bina is called the "Upper World" and Malchut is called the "lower %0a%3c world." On Shabbat, ZON ascend to Bina, ZA to AVI, and Malchut to Tvuna. %0a%3c %0a%3c On Shabbat, Malchut merges with Tvuna. However, this does not mean that %0a%3c no difference is left between them, for Malchut receives the Light from Tvuna %0a%3c only because she ascends to Tvuna 's level. Yet, at her place on the last, lowest %0a%3c degree of the world of Atzilut, Malchut is unable to receive the Light from Tvuna. %0a%3c And to the extent that Malchut cannot yet receive the Light from Tvuna in her %0a%3c regular state, she is defined as "closed." %0a%3c %0a%3c Also, Tvuna suffers from Malchut being closed because while in her place, %0a%3c Malchut cannot receive the Light from Tvuna, for the revelation of Tvuna is %0a%3c possible only through Malchut. On Shabbat, Tvuna and Ima join to form one %0a%3c Partzuf, which is not closed. Yet, since its Light shines only when Malchut ascends %0a%3c to it, Tvuna feels the closed state of Malchut, and suffers, too. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 228 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 82. One Shabbat was left, unmentioned Above, and felt ashamed. She said to %0a%3c Him, "The Creator of the universe, from the day I was created, I am called %0a%3c Shabbat, but there is no day without night." The Creator replied to her: "My %0a%3c daughter, you are Shabbat, and I have given you this name. But now I am %0a%3c surrounding and adorning you with the most exalted adornment." He then %0a%3c raised His voice and proclaimed, "Those who sanctify shall fear. And this is %0a%3c the night of Shabbat that radiates fear." But who is she? It is the merging %0a%3c together of I (Malchut, the nights of Shabbat) with the Creator Himself (ZA) %0a%3c into a single whole. And I've heard from my father that the word Et refers %0a%3c to the boundaries-borders of Shabbat. Shabbatot (two Sabbaths) denote a %0a%3c circle and a square within, which total two. According to them, there are %0a%3c two sanctities we should mention during the Shabbat blessing: Vayechulu %0a%3c consists of thirty-five words, and Kiddush, too, consists of thirty-five words. %0a%3c Collectively, they make up to the seventy names of ZA, with which ZA (the %0a%3c Creator), and Malchut (the Assembly of Israel) adorn themselves. %0a%3c %0a%3c 83. Since the circle and square are Shabbatot, they are both included in the %0a%3c instruction, "My Shabbatot you are to observe." However, the Upper Shabbat %0a%3c is not included in the instruction "Observe," but rather in "Remember." For %0a%3c the Supernal King, Bina is as perfect as memory. This is why Bina is called %0a%3c "King," whose perfection lies in peace and in memory. Hence, there is no %0a%3c contradiction Above. %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut de Malchut is called the central point of creation, and receives no %0a%3c Light even on Shabbat, as, being a Man'ula (lock), she is closed to the Light. %0a%3c And the entire Light enters her only in the form of Miftacha (key), into Yesod de %0a%3c Malchut, in Malchut that joins Bina with her properties, while Malchut herself is %0a%3c therefore referred to as "locked." %0a%3c %0a%3c This central point of creation is the only thing that the Creator created, and %0a%3c is comprised of all the creatures, including human souls. And she argues with %0a%3c the Creator that in the beginning of creation, in the world of AK, the entire %0a%3c Light was revealed and shone upon the creatures thanks to her, for there was no %0a%3c other Malchut in the world of AK, except for the central point. And only due to %0a%3c Tzimtzum Bet (second restriction), now in the world of Atzilut, was she restricted %0a%3c and closed to the reception of Light. %0a%3c %0a%3c And this is a great and wonderful secret, for, as Malchut objects, even on %0a%3c the first day, it is said: "And there shall be evening, and there shall be morning- %0a%3c one day." (Beresheet, 1:6) In other words, unity is revealed in both night and %0a%3c day together. Yet, why is the night of the first Shabbat not mentioned in the %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Donkey Driver %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 229 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Torah, and only the words "on the seventh day" are used? The Creator replied %0a%3c to Malchut that a future Shabbat is implied— Shabbat of the seventh millennium, %0a%3c when the day of Shabbat will come and remain forever. %0a%3c %0a%3c Meanwhile, during the 6,000 years, the Creator elevates Malchut to Bina, and %0a%3c as a result, she receives Supernal Adornments, greater than the ones she had had %0a%3c in the world of AK. For there she acted as the end of all Sefirot, but now she has %0a%3c risen to act in the place of GAR, in AVI, which are called "holy of holies." %0a%3c %0a%3c If Malchut is in Yesod, the lack of Ohr Hochma is felt. But if Malchut ascends %0a%3c to AVI (where Ohr Hassadim is present, and there is absolutely no need for Ohr %0a%3c Hochma), this state is defined as perfect. %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut is called "fear," for she was restricted to refrain from receiving the %0a%3c Creator's Light within her desire to receive pleasure. Therefore, she does not %0a%3c receive the Light from Above within her desire to receive pleasure. Instead, %0a%3c she receives the Light only in Ohr Hozer (Returning Light), when she refuses %0a%3c to use her egoism. %0a%3c %0a%3c This occurs in the following way: first, Ohr Yashar (Direct Light) comes from %0a%3c the Creator to Malchut and wishes to enter her (Malchut feels both the delight %0a%3c and her own desire to receive and enjoy it). Secondly, by wishing to be like the %0a%3c Creator, Malchut repels the Light (prohibits herself from receiving the delight). %0a%3c %0a%3c This renunciation of egoistic pleasure is called Ohr Hozer (Returning Light), %0a%3c because Malchut repels the Light (pleasure) from her. Thirdly, after Malchut %0a%3c has created Ohr Hozer, she begins to receive Ohr Yashar in it (her new desire %0a%3c to receive only because the Creator wants her to). This reception is possible %0a%3c because Malchut has an anti-egoistic force, will power, called a screen. %0a%3c %0a%3c The spiritual world is a realm of sensations, desires, and forces, not vested %0a%3c in shells-garments, like the corporeal bodies in our world. Similarly, all the %0a%3c characters depicted in Kabbalah do not designate any images; rather, they %0a%3c demonstrate interactions of forces and properties. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, a circle implies that the Light shines completely unrestrictedly in %0a%3c every place and to the same extent, so there can be no change in its radiance. %0a%3c A square or a rectangle indicates restrictions, which create differences between %0a%3c the sides: right and left, top and bottom. Hence, the head has a round shape %0a%3c with regard to the rectangular shape of the body, for the Rosh (head) is free of %0a%3c restrictions, but VAK (body) are not. %0a%3c %0a%3c Shabbat is a spiritual state, when ZON ascend to AVI and clothe them. As %0a%3c a result, the lower Shabbat (ZON) and the Upper Shabbat (AVI) merge into one. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 230 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Upper Shabbat (AVI) is designated by a circle, and the lower Shabbat (ZON) %0a%3c is designated by a square. On Shabbat, ZON merge with AVI, depicted as the %0a%3c square's ascent and insertion into the circle. %0a%3c %0a%3c Ohr Hochma is designated by the letter Ayin. Since Ohr Hochma is revealed %0a%3c only during the ascent of the lower Shabbat to the Upper, Ohr Hochma is %0a%3c divided into two parts: one half for the Upper Shabbat, and one for the lower. %0a%3c Hence, the passage of Vayechulu (Beresheet, 2:1) consists of thirty-five words %0a%3c that refer to half of the Light of the Upper Shabbat, whereas the blessing itself %0a%3c consists of thirty-five words that refer to half of the Light of the lower Shabbat. %0a%3c And the common soul, called the "Assembly of Israel" or Malchut (Shabbat), is %0a%3c adorned with this Light. %0a%3c %0a%3c Since the circle and the square merge and assume the name Shabbatot (two %0a%3c Shabbats), the Light of both the circle and the square is defined as protecting— %0a%3c GUARD. And, although the word GUARD alludes to restrictions and borders %0a%3c that one must observe and fear violating, whereas the Upper Shabbat (designated %0a%3c by a circle) has no restrictions and borders, due to the joining of the two Shabbatot %0a%3c into one, there still appeared restrictions and borders. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Upper Shabbat is called REMEMBER, and not OBSERVE, as it is %0a%3c completely free of restrictions. However, since it merged with the lower Shabbat, %0a%3c called OBSERVE, it, too, needs to GUARD, which normally relates to Malchut %0a%3c alone. Only due to Malchut 's ascent to Bina did the need to guard, which is %0a%3c present in Malchut, arose in Bina. But Bina herself remains only in the property of %0a%3c REMEMBER, for only egoistic desires to receive pleasure need GUARDING. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Upper Shabbat (Bina) is designated by the letters MI = Mem-Yod. The %0a%3c lower Shabbat (Malchut) is designated by the letters MA = Mem-Hey, and has the %0a%3c form of a square, which implies a presence of controversy between its properties— %0a%3c the right and the left sides, which give it its square form. %0a%3c %0a%3c 84. There are two types of peace below: one is Yaakov (Tifferet), and the other %0a%3c is Yosef (Yesod). Therefore, PEACE is written twice in the greeting: "PEACE, %0a%3c PEACE to the distant one and to the near one." "The distant one" refers to %0a%3c Yaakov, and "the near one" refers to Yosef. Or, as it is written, "From afar I %0a%3c see the Creator," "Came to a stop far in the distance." %0a%3c %0a%3c "Below" signifies ZON, containing one of the properties, Yaakov or the Sefira %0a%3c Tifferet de ZA. ZON also contain the property called Yosef, or Yesod. Both these %0a%3c Sefirot indicate the place of a potential Zivug between ZA and Maichut, for Peace %0a%3c signifies Zivug. The Upper Zivug (Yaakov) is intended for reception of Ohr Hochma %0a%3c from Above, and the lower Zivug (Yosef) fills Malchut only with Ohr Hassadim. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Donkey Driver %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 231 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c It was already mentioned that it is impossible to receive Ohr Hochma without %0a%3c it being clothed in Ohr Hassadim. Ohr Hochma or the Zivug that is made on it is %0a%3c therefore defined as distant, for it must first be clothed in Ohr Hassadim before %0a%3c it can receive Ohr Hochma. Hence, it is written, "From afar I saw the Creator." %0a%3c %0a%3c The lower Zivug is called "the near one," because the Partzuf receives Ohr %0a%3c Hassadim without any preliminary actions. Furthermore, with the help of this %0a%3c Ohr Hassadim, the Partzuf subsequently receives Ohr Hochma. This is why the %0a%3c word "peace" is used twice: "Peace, peace to the far and to the near"— a greeting %0a%3c to Yaakov and Yosef, respectively, both of whom take part in the great Zivug (the %0a%3c reception of Ohr Hochma) in ZA. %0a%3c %0a%3c These two greetings are defined in ZON as a square, as there is controversy %0a%3c between them, defined as the controversy between the right and the left sides, %0a%3c and they end in the letter Hey—Nukva or Malchut, whereas the Upper Nukva %0a%3c (Bina) ends with the letter Yod, which designates not the female part, but the %0a%3c male. Hence, there is no controversy in her. %0a%3c %0a%3c Even the notions of "near" and "far" do not exist in Bina herself, for %0a%3c she refers to GAR, perfection, and GAR can receive Ohr Hochma nearby, %0a%3c meaning they do not need to clothe in Ohr Hassadim beforehand, but can %0a%3c receive Ohr Hochma without Ohr Hassadim. Hence, it is said that the Upper %0a%3c Malchut is the King, who has peace. Thus, unlike ZON, two notions of peace %0a%3c are absent in him. %0a%3c %0a%3c 85. "From afar" is the Supernal Point, standing in His palace, of which it is said, %0a%3c "You are to guard." "You shall fear My sanctity" refers to the point standing %0a%3c in the center, which must be feared more than anything, for its punishment %0a%3c is death, as it is written, "All who transgress in it shall perish." Who are these %0a%3c transgressors? They are those who have entered the space of the circle and the %0a%3c square, and committed a sin. Hence, it is written, "You shall fear!" This point %0a%3c is called "I," and there is a prohibition on its revelation, called HaVaYaH. "I" %0a%3c and HaVaYaH are a single whole. Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Aba dismounted %0a%3c from their donkeys and kissed him. They said, "So great is your wisdom, and %0a%3c yet you drive donkeys behind us! Who are you, then?" He replied to them: %0a%3c "Do not ask me who I am, but let us go on and study the Torah. Each of us %0a%3c will speak his wisdom so as to illuminate our path." %0a%3c %0a%3c The distant point refers to the point that opens the way to the Partzuf for %0a%3c thirty-two streams of Ohr Hochma. And this is the letter Bet in the first word %0a%3c of the Torah— Beresheet, called the "point in the hall," from which Ohr Hochma %0a%3c descends to ZON, when ZON ascend to AVI. For then, the two Shabbatot (the %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 232 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Upper— AVI and the lower— ZON) merge. It is written about them: "I saw the %0a%3c Creator from afar," for ZON cannot receive Ohr Hochma without being clothed %0a%3c in Ohr Hassadim. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hochma and Bina, called the "point in the hall," are referred to as "distant %0a%3c from ZON," for they need the garment of Ohr Hassadim from the lower world, %0a%3c Nulcva, called MA. Malchut of the world of AK is the central point, called the %0a%3c "lock," whereas Malchut of the world of Atzilut (the point in the hall) is the %0a%3c "key," as the Light from ZATde Bina (YESHSUT) can be received in it. %0a%3c %0a%3c The circle is called AVI, the square— ZON. ZON ascend to AVI and thus %0a%3c the square enters the circle. As a result, two properties appear in Malchut of %0a%3c AVI: the "lock" (Malchut de Malchut, the central point or Malchut de AVI), and %0a%3c the "key" (the point in the hall, Yesod de Malchut or Malchut de YESHSUT). %0a%3c Malchut de AVI is called space, for she is unattainable, and he who wishes to %0a%3c fill her with Light is punished by death. It is written about it: "You shall fear %0a%3c My sanctity." %0a%3c %0a%3c The point itself is called "I," and AVI is HaVaYaH that merges with it. And %0a%3c they are defined as a single whole; hence, the point itself is referred to as AVI, %0a%3c meaning that it is characterized as holy, as the property of AVI. %0a%3c %0a%3c As was already mentioned before, The Zohar and the entire Torah speak %0a%3c exclusively of spiritual degrees, the structure of spiritual worlds, and the %0a%3c revelation of the Creator's governance to us. There is not a word in the Torah %0a%3c that refers to our world. The whole Torah is, as it is said, "The Creator's sacred %0a%3c names." And those who reduce it from its spiritual heights to the corporeal level %0a%3c their commentaries cast it down completely. %0a%3c %0a%3c Rashi says that the Torah only speaks in human tongue, but it tells us of man's %0a%3c spiritual paths toward his Creator. Therefore, when we read that one Rabbi went %0a%3c to visit another, the real meaning is that one spiritual degree, called, for example, %0a%3c Rabbi Elazar, passes to another spiritual degree, called, for example, Rabbi Yosi. %0a%3c %0a%3c ZA has his own AVI, who are called the Upper AVI. The wife of ZA (Nukva %0a%3c or Malchut) contains AVI, too, called YESHSUT. First, ZA attains the AVI of his %0a%3c wife (YESHSUT or Ohr Hassadim). Then it rises to a Higher Degree and attains %0a%3c the AVI themselves— Ohr Hochma (also called Ohr Haya). %0a%3c %0a%3c The righteous who ascend the spiritual degrees are the constituents of %0a%3c Partzuf ZA. Since the degree of Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Aba is Ohr Hassadim (the %0a%3c Light of Neshama), this ascent means it went to (spiritually) see (in Ohr Hochma) %0a%3c another spiritual degree. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Donkey Driver %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 233 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c In the spiritual worlds, the donkey driver constitutes a special spiritual force %0a%3c that helps the souls of the righteous move from one spiritual degree to another. %0a%3c Without this help sent by the Creator from Above, it is impossible to exit your %0a%3c degree and ascend to the next. Hence, the Creator sends a Higher soul from %0a%3c Above to each of the righteous (those who wish to ascend). Each receives his %0a%3c own, according to his degree, properties, and purpose. %0a%3c %0a%3c And so, at first the righteous fails to recognize this exalted soul; he %0a%3c considers it low, that it leeched onto him on his spiritual path. Such state %0a%3c is called Ibur— conception of the righteous' soul. Since the Higher soul has %0a%3c not yet completed its assistance and purpose, it is not yet perceived by the %0a%3c righteous for what it really is. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, after it completes its task in its entirety, and brings the righteous' %0a%3c soul to the Upper Degree for which it is intended, the righteous then reveals %0a%3c the exalted properties of the soul that helped him. This is referred to as the %0a%3c revelation of the soul to the righteous. %0a%3c %0a%3c In our case, the soul that was sent to help the souls of Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi %0a%3c Aba was the soul of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba— a very exalted and perfect soul, the %0a%3c Light of Yechida. Yet, initially, it is revealed to the righteous in its smallest scope, %0a%3c called Ibur, conception (in sensations). Hence, they perceive it as the level of a %0a%3c spiritual donkey driver— a simple soul. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Hebrew word for donkey is Hamor, which also means matter, Homer] %0a%3c Thus, one who can control his donkey, his body, his desires, ascends above matter %0a%3c as a spiritual being. And since he wishes to ascend above matter in his desires, he %0a%3c is considered a righteous. However, here, The Zohar speaks of Higher Degrees. %0a%3c %0a%3c The donkey driver's task is to take the riders, mounted atop of their donkeys, %0a%3c from place to place; yet, he walks in front of his donkeys, thereby leading them %0a%3c through spiritual degrees. Since every word in the Torah has several meanings, %0a%3c due to the multiplicity of the Upper Roots (wherefrom word notions descend), %0a%3c the notion of a "donkey driver" is more precisely referred to as a "donkey guide," %0a%3c and implies properties that are coarse, sinful, and most base. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, Rabbi Aba said: "Let us open the gates of the Torah, for the time %0a%3c has come for us to correct our path," that is, to open their souls with the help %0a%3c of the secrets of the Torah, so their path would be correct and lead them to %0a%3c the Creator. Rabbi Elazar then began to discuss a passage from the Torah that %0a%3c says, "You shall observe my Shabbatot," as he stood at this degree (the Light of %0a%3c YESHSUT) in his properties. He therefore concluded that Shabbat itself is the %0a%3c property of ZON, which has not yet reached the property of sanctity, but only %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 234 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c receives the Light of YESHSUT on Shabbat. It is written about this Light, "You %0a%3c shall fear my sanctity," for when Ohr Hochma passes from YESHSUT to ZA, it %0a%3c evokes fear in them. %0a%3c %0a%3c And here they receive the donkey driver's help, who reveals to them the %0a%3c secret of Ohr Haya. He explains that the phrase "You shall observe my Shabbatot" %0a%3c signifies the Upper and the lower Shabbatot, which come together, due to the %0a%3c ascent of ZON to AVI. As a result, ZON themselves become holy (the square %0a%3c within the circle) and acquire the properties of Bina: mercy, altruism, Ohr %0a%3c Hassadim. Hence, it is written with regard to them: fear not and observe. For %0a%3c Ohr Haya repels foreign, impure forces and desires, and all restrictions are lifted %0a%3c on Shabbat; hence, there is no fear. %0a%3c %0a%3c And, according to the donkey driver's explanation, the phrase "You shall %0a%3c fear My sanctity" refers only to the central point that is used in GAR de AVI, in %0a%3c GAR of Ohr Haya, which is unattainable and where fear does exist. %0a%3c %0a%3c At that, the soul of the donkey driver has fulfilled its role, for it brought %0a%3c them to the attainment of Ohr Haya. Only then did they merit the attainment %0a%3c of the height of the soul that had helped them, since they attained its revelation %0a%3c and were thus able to appreciate it. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is why Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Aba dismounted from their donkeys %0a%3c and kissed him, for the attainment of the Upper One is defined as a "kiss." %0a%3c However, this exalted soul has not yet finished aiding them: it must still help %0a%3c them attain Ohr Yechida. Yet, since the attainment of Ohr Haya already provides %0a%3c perfection, they've already attained thereby the degree of the son of Rabbi %0a%3c Hamnuna-Saba. %0a%3c %0a%3c The level of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba himself is the degree of attainment %0a%3c of Ohr Yechida. Therefore, by attaining only Ohr Haya, they mistakenly %0a%3c thought that the soul guiding them belongs to the son of Rabbi Hamnuna- %0a%3c Saba. However, after the donkey driver had revealed to them the secret of the %0a%3c attainment of Ohr Yechida, they realized that their companion is none other %0a%3c than Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba himself. %0a%3c %0a%3c And the reason why they could not recognize him before is that the powers %0a%3c of the helping soul cannot be seen until its role is fulfilled. Hence, they asked %0a%3c him to reveal his name, but he told them not to inquire about his name, for %0a%3c without having completed all the corrections, they do not merit the revelation %0a%3c of the secrets of the Torah. And he must help them in their studies of the %0a%3c Torah, for he still needs to illuminate their path, as they have not yet attained %0a%3c the desired goal. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Donkey Driver %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 235 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 86. He said to him: "Who appointed you to walk here and be a donkey driver?" %0a%3c He replied: "The letter Yod waged war with two letters, Chaf and Samech, for %0a%3c me to come and join. The letter Chaf did not want to leave its place because it %0a%3c has to support those who fall, for without a screen, they cannot survive." %0a%3c %0a%3c 87. The letter Yod came to me alone, kissed me and wept with me. It said to %0a%3c me, "My son, what can I do for you? I disappear from many good deeds and %0a%3c from secret, supernal, basic letters. But I shall return to you and will be of %0a%3c help to you. And I shall give you two letters that are more exalted than those %0a%3c that have disappeared— the letters Yod and Shin. They shall become for you a %0a%3c treasury that is forever full. So, my son, go and drive the donkeys. And that is %0a%3c why I am here in this role." %0a%3c %0a%3c As we already know, the donkey driver is an auxiliary force given to someone %0a%3c who wishes to ascend to a higher spiritual degree on his path toward the Creator, %0a%3c just as donkeys carry people on their backs, thereby helping them travel from %0a%3c one place to another. As this happens, the righteous one falls from his previous %0a%3c degree and enters the embryonic state of the new degree, just as the soul that %0a%3c came to help him. However, the property of Ibur-embryo (lbur is also derived %0a%3c from the word Haavarah, crossing) means that all the Light that it had in the %0a%3c previous degree disappears upon the conception (lbur) of a new, Higher Degree. %0a%3c %0a%3c And that is what they wanted to know of the donkey driver: "How did the %0a%3c Creator bring you here in the state of lbur, in our state of lbur, as a result of which %0a%3c the Light in us has disappeared? Who lowers you from the Higher Degrees?" %0a%3c And that is why the donkey driver replied that the letter Yod waged war against %0a%3c the letters Chaf and Samech, to join with them. The degree of Hassadim is called %0a%3c Samech (Ohr Neshama). %0a%3c %0a%3c "When the time has come for you to attain Ohr Haya (Yod from HaVaYaH, %0a%3c the degree from which I descended to help you to attain Ohr Haya), Hochma %0a%3c really wanted to connect Ohr Neshama (that was previously in you) to me. And %0a%3c here Yod wages war against Chaf and Samech. Malchut of the Upper Partzuf %0a%3c clothes in the lower Partzuf, designated by the letter Chaf. There used to be Ohr %0a%3c Neshama, and now there is Ohr Haya, whereas Yod, which desires Ohr Neshama %0a%3c as well, merges with it, and rejects the Chaf." %0a%3c %0a%3c This is so because the connection between the degrees, from the Highest %0a%3c Degree in the world of Atzilut to the end of the world of Assiya, is realized only %0a%3c by Malchut of the Upper One descending to the lower one and clothing in it. %0a%3c Malchut of the Upper One herself cannot descend from her degree of YESHSUT %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 236 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c (the degree of Neshama) even for a moment, as the chain connecting the degrees %0a%3c would be instantly broken. %0a%3c %0a%3c The property of Samech is the property of the Light itself, which the soul %0a%3c receives from Sefirot HBD HGT of AVI (above the Cha^eh), and which AVI pass %0a%3c to ZON when the letters are in Katnut, and support them (the Hebrew word for %0a%3c support is Somech, derived from the letter Samech) so that ZON will not fall from %0a%3c the world of Atzilut. %0a%3c %0a%3c The letter Chaf, Hassadim, is unwilling to leave its place and join Hochma, %0a%3c as it needs to connect the Upper Partzuf to the lower one. Thus, it must always %0a%3c remain in its place, for all the degrees are constant, and only the soul changes %0a%3c while moving from one degree to another within the worlds. This is why the %0a%3c soul is called the "inner part" with regard to the world (the external part)— the %0a%3c soul exists and moves about within the world by changing its properties. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, the Light of the soul did not wish to join the letter Yod (degree of %0a%3c Hochma, the soul of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba) as it descended to help Rabbi Elazar %0a%3c and Rabbi Aba. This is because they needed a new Light that would build a new %0a%3c degree within them, the degree of Ohr Haya, whereas each new degree is built from %0a%3c scratch, from the state of Ibur (conception). As that happens, the entire previous %0a%3c degree with all of its Light disappears. Similarly, in their case, the new degree %0a%3c starts with Ibur and reaches the level of Haya. This resembles a seed that must %0a%3c first abandon its present form and rot, in order to become a tree afterwards. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is therefore written that it came to me without the Light of HBD HGT %0a%3c de AVI, called Samech, the Light of Hassadim. Samech is the property of mercy, a %0a%3c selfless desire to give, pure spiritual altruism. Hence, it is unwilling to join Yod, %0a%3c Ohr Hochma. Yet, Ohr Hochma cannot enter and fill the Partzuf without first %0a%3c being clothed in Ohr Hassadim, for this clothing of Ohr Hochma in Ohr Hassadim %0a%3c means that the Partzuf receives Ohr Hochma not for itself, but for the Creator's %0a%3c sake. But Ohr Hassadim, Samech, does not wish to receive anything within itself; %0a%3c it wants nothing to do with Ohr Hochma] This is why the letter Yod wept, being %0a%3c unable to fill the Partzuf with its Light, for Hassadim refused to accept Hochma. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is written in this regard: Hence, I must now disappear, and you, the donkey %0a%3c driver, go to the state of Ibur, to rebuild the degrees of gradual development of %0a%3c a new Part?u/-state with you: Ibur (embryo), Leidah (birth), Yenika (nursing), and %0a%3c Mochin (maturity). %0a%3c %0a%3c And know that such is the order of creating (begetting) each new degree: %0a%3c every time one is to attain a new degree, he must undergo (in his properties) a %0a%3c complete disappearance of the previous degree (level of attainment, Light), and %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Donkey Driver %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 237 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c begin anew. He must receive new attainments, from the lowest new degree, Ohr %0a%3c Nefesh (Ibur), to Ohr Ruach (Yenika), and so on, as though he had never attained %0a%3c any spiritual level at all. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is impossible to take with you anything from a previous degree. Hence, one %0a%3c must start anew from the lowest level of Ibur, called THE DONKEY DRIVER. %0a%3c Ohr Haya de AVI is called YESH (Yod-Shin), where Yod is Hochma and Shin is Bina. %0a%3c And, of course, they are more important than the Ohr Neshama that was in the %0a%3c Partzuf before them. %0a%3c %0a%3c 88. Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Aba rejoiced, wept, and said, "You sit on the %0a%3c donkey, and we shall drive it." He replied to them, "Have I not told you that %0a%3c it is the command of the King that I act as I do, until the other donkey driver %0a%3c appears" (this hints at the Mashiach, who, as it is said, will appear poor and %0a%3c riding a donkey). They said to him, "You have not even told us your name! %0a%3c Where do you dwell?" He told them, "My dwelling place is wonderful %0a%3c and very precious to me. It is a tower that soars in the air, grand and unique. %0a%3c Only two live in this tower: the Creator and I. That is the place, in which %0a%3c I dwell. And I am exiled from there in order to drive the donkeys." Rabbi %0a%3c Elazar and Rabbi Aba looked at him, and his words were unclear to them, for %0a%3c they tasted sweeter than manna and honey. They said to him, "Perhaps you %0a%3c will tell us the name of your father, so that we could kiss the earth at his feet?" %0a%3c He responded, "What for? It is not my habit to boast of the Torah." %0a%3c %0a%3c After they have attained the greatness of the donkey driver's degree, they %0a%3c could no longer bear his small state of Ibur, which he inhabited for their sake. %0a%3c Hence, they told him that since they have already attained Ohr Hochma, he has %0a%3c done enough and can leave the state of Ibur. And should a need arise to add %0a%3c anything else to them, they would be able to enter Ibur on their own, and he %0a%3c does not need to suffer for their sake. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, the donkey driver warned them beforehand to not ask him his %0a%3c name, for they still require revelations of secrets of the Torah. Once again, he %0a%3c hinted that it is the degree of Ohr Yechida that they lack, which is implied here. %0a%3c This degree signifies the reception of the Light of the King Messiah's face, %0a%3c which he mentioned by hinting at the poor donkey driver, as described by a %0a%3c prophet (Zachariah, 9:9). And he is commanded by the Creator to help them %0a%3c attain Ohr Yechida. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is why they asked him about the type of his soul: "For you did not wish %0a%3c to reveal your name, as we have not yet received from you that which we must %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 238 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c attain. But if so, at least tell us where you live, what is your degree? At least then %0a%3c we will know what we lack, what else we must receive, attain from you." %0a%3c %0a%3c He replied that his place is much higher than his present location, for now %0a%3c he himself cannot attain his own individual level. This is a result of the Upper %0a%3c Partzuf descending to the place of the lower one and becoming completely %0a%3c identical to it, and while there (in that state), the Upper Partzuf can no longer %0a%3c attain its own level. The tower that soars in the air is Bina, Hassadim. The %0a%3c Mashiach's tower (the great tower) designates the time (state) of ascent to GAR de %0a%3c AA, when Ohr Hochma is available. %0a%3c %0a%3c 89. But the place of my father's dwelling was in the Great Sea. And he was %0a%3c a big fish that continually circled the Great Sea, from one end to the other. %0a%3c And he was mighty and he grew old, until he swallowed up all the other fish %0a%3c in that sea. And then he released them, and they were thriving and filled %0a%3c with all of the very best of the world. And it was in his power to swim across %0a%3c the entire sea in one instant. And He pulled him out and hauled him in %0a%3c with an arrow, like a warrior, and brought him to the place that I told you %0a%3c about, to the tower that soars in the air, but he returned to his place and %0a%3c disappeared in that sea. %0a%3c %0a%3c The concealed Zivug is called Shaar HaNun (the 50 th gate). The Great Sea is %0a%3c Malchut. All the Zivugim from Partzuf Atik de Atzilut and below do not include %0a%3c the Great Sea in its entirety, all the Sefirot of Malchut, but only the first nine %0a%3c Sefirot of Malchut. Moreover, none of the Zivugim include Malchut de Malchut. %0a%3c %0a%3c This Sefira, Malchut de Malchut, is the only creation, because all the other %0a%3c Sefirot constitute properties of spiritual forces and desires above Malchut, existing %0a%3c in and referring to the Creator, the sole purpose of which is the correction of %0a%3c Malchut de Malchut. The only Zivug on this Malchut exists in Atik, and it will be %0a%3c revealed to all only at the end of correction. %0a%3c %0a%3c Rav Hamnuna-Saba emerged from this concealed Zivug in Atik; hence, the %0a%3c donkey driver calls him "my father." And he says that his father lived in the %0a%3c Great Sea, as this Zivug was on the entire Malchut, on Malchut de Malchut, called %0a%3c the "Great Sea." %0a%3c %0a%3c Yet, if one were to argue that all Partzufim make a Zivug on the Light with %0a%3c a screen that stands before Malchut, then that Zivug was made on the 50 th gate, %0a%3c on all the parts of the desire, on the full depth of the Great Sea (Malchut), down %0a%3c to the very last of her desires and properties, from Keter de Malchut to Malchut %0a%3c de Malchut, from end to end of the Great Sea. Nevertheless, this occurs only %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Donkey Driver %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 239 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c In Partzuf Atik de Atzilut, but not below it. And this is not the donkey driver %0a%3c himself, but his father. %0a%3c %0a%3c This occurs because the great Zivug absorbs all the other particular Zivugim %0a%3c ("swallows all the other fish in the Great Sea") and all the souls in all the worlds, %0a%3c for they are all much weaker than it. Hence, it is as though they do not exist in %0a%3c its greatness and might. And since it includes absolutely everything, they are all %0a%3c called by the name Nunin, from the letter Nun (50). %0a%3c %0a%3c This indicates that after all the major corrections that follow this great Zivug, %0a%3c all those Lights and souls, absorbed during its Zivug, return and are born anew %0a%3c for eternal life, for they are completely filled with Light as a result of the great %0a%3c Zivug, when the Light absorbed them completely. %0a%3c %0a%3c All the Zivugim below Partzuf Atik stem from unifications of the Sefirot with %0a%3c one another. These unifications are defined as interruptions in a Zivug, whereas %0a%3c the Zivug in Atik is direct and without unification. Thus, it is defined as "instant," %0a%3c for it goes on uninterrupted. It is therefore written that "he crosses the entire %0a%3c sea in an instant," without any garments-unifications. And it mounts an attack, %0a%3c for there is great power of reception of Ohr Hochma in this Zivug; hence, he said: %0a%3c "Begets, like an arrow in the hands of a warrior." %0a%3c %0a%3c It is written of this Zivug in Partzuf Atik: "No one else but you saw the %0a%3c Creator." However, no birth is possible without the forces of resistance, since, %0a%3c as is written: "The seed that is not shot like an arrow does not beget." (Talmud, %0a%3c Hagigah, 16). Hence, after he had begotten me and hid me in the Great Tower, %0a%3c he returned to his concealed Zivug. %0a%3c %0a%3c 90. Rabbi Elazar contemplated his words and replied: "You are the son of the %0a%3c Holy Source, you are the son of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba, you are the son of the %0a%3c Source of the Torah, and you drive donkeys behind us!" They wept and kissed %0a%3c him, and continued their journey. Then he said: "If it pleases our master, let %0a%3c him reveal his name to us." %0a%3c %0a%3c It is written "looked," because sight signifies Hochma, and no other words, %0a%3c such as "said," "heard" (Bina) or "thought" could be used in its stead. Since they %0a%3c have not yet attained to the full extent of perfection what the donkey driver %0a%3c had told them, and their attainment reached only as high as Ohr Haya, they %0a%3c were delighted with what was begotten by Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba, for Rabbi %0a%3c Hamnuna-Saba is Ohr Yechida. %0a%3c %0a%3c He asked him to reveal his name, that is, to receive his degree, for the %0a%3c attainment of a name denotes the attainment of the spiritual degree. Therefore, %0a%3c the saying, "the entire Torah consists only of the Creator's names," means that the %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 240 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c entire Torah constitutes the degrees that one must attain, up to the very highest, %0a%3c called "Love" ("Introduction to The Study of the Ten Sefirot," items 70-71). %0a%3c %0a%3c Each degree in the attainment of the Upper Worlds has its own name. All %0a%3c the Creator's names: Moshe, Pharaoh, Avraham, the Temple, Sinai— every single %0a%3c word in the Torah— are degrees of perception of the Creator, degrees of attaining %0a%3c Him, for nothing exists besides man and his Creator. Everything else that exists %0a%3c in the world, as it seems to us, are the various degrees of our perception of the %0a%3c Creator Himself. He may appear to us as this world, and He may appear as the %0a%3c world of Assiya, as Yetzira, Beria, Atzilut, or He may be revealed completely, without %0a%3c partial concealments of the spiritual world or total concealment of our world. %0a%3c Thus, the word Olam (world) is derived from the Haalamah (concealment). %0a%3c %0a%3c 91. He opened and began. It is written, "Benayahu (Benaiah) Ben (the son %0a%3c of) Yehoyada (Jehoiada)." This narrative is beautiful, but it serves to show %0a%3c us the exalted secrets of the Torah. And the name Benayahu Ben-Yehoyada %0a%3c indicates the secret of the Light of Wisdom, Ohr Hochma. Ben Ish Choi %0a%3c is the righteous who revives the worlds. Rav Paalim means that He is the %0a%3c Master of all that transpires, and that all the forces and Supernal Troops %0a%3c stem from Him. He is called the Creator of Force, the Master of all, and He %0a%3c is in everything. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is written in Prophets: "Benayahu, the son of Yehoyada," (Shmuel II, %0a%3c 23:20). Here, The Zohar reveals to us the exalted secrets of the Torah, for the %0a%3c holy name of Yehoyada consists of two: Yod-Hey-Vav, the first three letters of %0a%3c HaVaYaH, and Yeda (knowledge). %0a%3c %0a%3c Keter of the world of Atzilut is called RADLA (unattainable head), whereas %0a%3c Atik itself surrounds all the other Partzufim of the world of Atzilut— AA, AVI, and %0a%3c ZON. Atik is called Makif (surrounding), for the other, lower Partzufim cannot %0a%3c attain it or its Zivug. Moreover, they cannot attain anything that comes from it. %0a%3c In other words, there is nothing descending from Atik to the lower Partzufim. %0a%3c Even AA is concealed from them; hence, it is called the "concealed Hochma." %0a%3c However, it is not defined as unattainable, like Atik, for it contains a Zivug on %0a%3c Ohr Hochma. Nevertheless, this Light does not descend to the lower ones, but %0a%3c only a small luminescence from it, called He'arat Hochma, reaches them. %0a%3c %0a%3c And all the Light that fills the worlds through the 6,000 years comes from %0a%3c AVI and YESHSUT, who are called Hochma of the thirty-two paths or thirty-two %0a%3c forces (Elokim) of creation, i.e., thirty-two types of He'arat Hochma. This Light of %0a%3c Hochma is the result of Bina's ascent to AA, where she receives Ohr Hochma and %0a%3c shines downward. Therefore, all the Light of Hochma that is revealed through %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Donkey Driver %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 241 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c the 6,000 years, before the end of correction, is no more than the Light of Bina, %0a%3c which received Ohr Hochma upon ascending to AA. %0a%3c %0a%3c AA is called Yeda (knowledge) because it gives Ohr Hochma to Bina, and %0a%3c knows all the routes of Ohr Hochma into Bina and through her on to the lower %0a%3c ones. While making a Zivug, AA itself does not pass its Light downwards, but %0a%3c as AVI ascend to AA, they receive Ohr Hochma, called "thirty-two streams" or %0a%3c "paths of wisdom," which can be attained by the lower ones. %0a%3c %0a%3c Everything that is written in The Zohar refers to all the souls in general. %0a%3c However, there are exceptions that are not normally studied. There exist special, %0a%3c exalted souls that merit becoming a Kli, MAN for the great Zivug of RADLA %0a%3c after their exile, and to receive from this Zivug in the Upper World the degree %0a%3c of Yechida. These are the souls of Benayahu Ben-Yehoyada, Rabbi Hamnuna- %0a%3c Saba and a very few chosen others. These exalted souls reveal themselves to the %0a%3c righteous in this world, and as a result, the righteous merit delighting in Ohr %0a%3c Yechida, which shines only in such exalted souls, while still being in this world. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, the name of Benayahu Ben-Yehoyada indicates that it stems from %0a%3c the inner wisdom, the unattainable Light of Hochma of Atik. This name also %0a%3c causes the concealment of the Light of Hochma, for the name Yehoyada: Yod-Hey- %0a%3c Vav + Yeda means that only he who attains the first three letters Yod-Hey-Vav of %0a%3c the Creator's name HaVaYaH shall attain Him, and no other shall. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, this name remains concealed in its place. At first, the donkey %0a%3c driver explains the quality of this Zivug in Atik— its height, the power of the Light %0a%3c that emerges onto it in Rosh de Atik, which the name of this Zivug, "Ben hh Chai %0a%3c Rav Paalim ve Mekabtziel," indicates. And then he explains what is concealed and %0a%3c what descends to the souls. %0a%3c %0a%3c It was already stated that this Zivug takes place at the end of the correction of %0a%3c the entire Malchut. Hence, it includes all the individual Zivugim and the degrees %0a%3c that emerge on them through the 6,000 years. All the Lights accumulate into %0a%3c one. All the types of MAN combine into one and ascend to ask for this Zivug, %0a%3c which includes all the suffering and punishments gradually accumulated during %0a%3c the 6,000 years. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, the height and greatness of this Zivug and the degree of Light that %0a%3c emerges from it are infinite, and it destroys all the impure forces once and for %0a%3c all. Yesod de ZA, from which the Light of this Zivug (the combination of all the %0a%3c Lights over the full course of the 6,000 years) is emanated, is called "hh Chai Rav %0a%3c Paalim"— a vivid man of many actions. However, Malchut, which contains within %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 242 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c her all the MAN, suffering, and work performed during the 6,000 years, is called %0a%3c Mekabtziel (gathering one). %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar also calls it Tzadik Chai Olamim— the righteous, who revives the %0a%3c worlds, for it thereby points to the Sefira Yesod, which gives the Light to Malchut. %0a%3c The Sefira Yesod does not have a place to receive the Light for itself. Hence, it %0a%3c lives (Chai) only to pass the Light to Malchut. This is why it is called Tzadik (the %0a%3c righteous one), who revives the worlds (Chai Olamim). %0a%3c %0a%3c Its other name, Rav Paalim (performing many actions) indicates that %0a%3c it includes all the MAD of all the good deeds and all the degrees that were %0a%3c revealed through the 6,000 years. This is because all these degrees are now being %0a%3c revealed all at once in a cumulative, integrated Light, as they leave Yesod and %0a%3c enter Malchut. And since Yesod now gathers all the Light that was emanated %0a%3c during the 6,000 years into one, and passes it to Malchut, this action determines %0a%3c its name— Rav Paalim. %0a%3c %0a%3c 92. Rav Paalim is also Mekabtziel— the Exalted Tree, gathering and %0a%3c performing many actions, Supreme Above all. Where did it come from? %0a%3c From which degree did it originate? Once more, the source indicates— from %0a%3c Mekabtziel, for it is an exalted and concealed degree that none has seen. %0a%3c It includes everything, for it gathers all of the Upper Light within it, and %0a%3c everything originates from it. %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut-Nukva is also named Mekabtziel, for she receives and gathers all the %0a%3c Light from Yesod within herself. Hence, Yesod is called Rav Paalim. The degree %0a%3c that emerges onto this Zivug is called the "Supreme and Exalted Tree" that %0a%3c originated from Yesod and entered Malchut. The Zohar goes on to explain that to %0a%3c show us the quality and the origin of this exalted degree, the name Mekabtziel %0a%3c (gathering) is used; Yesod accumulates the Upper Light and passes it to Nukva. %0a%3c And both Yesod and Malchut are called Mekabtziel %0a%3c %0a%3c And the degree that emerges onto this Zivug of Yesod and Malchut is called %0a%3c "None but you has seen the Creator." This degree emerges after the complete %0a%3c correction has been achieved, at the moment of attachment of the final correction %0a%3c that completes them all. Therefore, this degree is defined as all-inclusive, for it %0a%3c collects all the Light over the full course of 6,000 years, and thereby manifests at %0a%3c once in its true perfection. %0a%3c %0a%3c 93. All of the degrees gather in this Supernal, Sacred, and Concealed Hall, %0a%3c where everything is concealed. All of the worlds are inside that hall. All the %0a%3c holy forces are sustained and revived by it, and all are dependant on it. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Donkey Driver %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 243 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar speaks of Rosh de Atik, where all the degrees and all the Light %0a%3c of all the worlds are concentrated and concealed. It further explains how this %0a%3c Zivug can occur up to the final correction, so it would combine all the degrees %0a%3c emerging one after another during the 6,000 years. And it would emerge instantly %0a%3c during the 6,000 years of the world's existence, when the degrees are in a state of %0a%3c constant ascents and descents, for as soon as a new degree, a new attainment of %0a%3c the Creator, of the Light, is revealed, the present degree disappears. This occurs %0a%3c due to the sin of the lower ones, who cannot retain this degree permanently %0a%3c (world— Olam, from the word Haalamah— concealment. The complete revelation %0a%3c of the Creator to His Creatures will take place at the end of the 6,000 years; %0a%3c thus, the world-concealment will cease to exist). %0a%3c %0a%3c So, whenever a degree disappears, it does so only from the sensation of one %0a%3c who attains a new degree. In reality, this degree ascends to Rosh de Atik and hides %0a%3c there, so as to, by joining other degrees, be manifested at the end of correction. %0a%3c %0a%3c In the same way, Atik gathers all the degrees revealed in the world during %0a%3c the 6,000 years, and conceals them within itself until the time of the end of %0a%3c correction comes; WHEN IT CORRECTS THE LAST PORTION OF WHAT %0a%3c IT MUST CORRECT, AND THUS CANNOT NO LONGER SIN. AND IT %0a%3c NO LONGER NEEDS TO SIN TO CORRECT THE NEXT PORTION OF %0a%3c EGOISM; HENCE, THIS FINAL DEGREE REMAINS PERMANENTLY %0a%3c AND DOES NOT DISAPPEAR. Then, Atik gathers all the degrees, and they all %0a%3c manifest simultaneously. %0a%3c %0a%3c Everyone has his own Partzuf Atik. How can one accelerate his advancement %0a%3c long the degrees of correction in this world and in the spiritual worlds? It if %0a%3c ritten in the Talmud that an old man bends as he walks, as if he's looking %0a%3c jmething that he had lost. %0a%3c %0a%3c An old man symbolizes someone of wisdom, Hochma, for even without ha %0a%3c lost anything, he looks beforehand for things he can correct in himself, and %0a%3c finds them. Hence, he does not require the previous degree of attainment to %0a%3c disappear from him. And if one does not discover new egoistic properties in %0a%3c need of correction within him, his previous degree disappears and a new one %0a%3c begins. However, this process is considerably slower than when one acts like %0a%3c old man in search of shortcomings. %0a%3c %0a%3c Throughout the 6,000 years, Atik is defined as unattainable. Therefore, its %0a%3c head is called RADLA (an abbreviation for the Aramaic words, Reisha de Lo %0a%3c Etiada, the "unattainable head"), whereas the name Atik is derived from the %0a%3c word Ne'etak (isolated) from the lower ones, for it does not shine upon them. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 244 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c And, although it accumulates within all the Lights that emerge from it itself and %0a%3c become revealed in the lower worlds, the Light of the end of correction remains %0a%3c concealed nonetheless. It follows that after each degree disappears due to the %0a%3c sins of the lower ones, it ascends to Rosh de Atik and conceals itself there. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, Guf de Atik, from its Peh downward, is located inside all the other %0a%3c Partzufim of the world of Atzilut, i.e., it is attainable by them. Thus, by clothing %0a%3c in the Partzufim of the world of Atzilut, Atik shines through them and gives the %0a%3c Light to them and to all the lower worlds of BYA. And any Light that shines on %0a%3c creation during the 6,000 years comes only from Guf de Atik, and not from some %0a%3c other spiritual object. %0a%3c %0a%3c We usually say that whatever is present in the Rosh of a Partzuf manifests in %0a%3c its Guf. This is also true with regard to all the Partzufim of the world of AK and %0a%3c all the other Partzufim in all the worlds, except in Partzuf Atik! This is so because %0a%3c Atik remains in Tzimtzum Aleph and descends down to our world. However, with %0a%3c regard to other Partzufim below it, Atik acts as though it is in T^imt^um Bet, making %0a%3c a special Zivug on itself and the Light from it descends to the lower worlds. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Light that comes to revive the worlds is called "sustenance" or Ohr %0a%3c Hassadim, and the Light that comes to stimulate the growth of the Partzufim, %0a%3c to turn a small Partzuf (Katnut) into a big one (Gadlut) is called Ohr Hochma. %0a%3c Both these Lights originate in Guf de Atik. Ohr Hochma, which makes a Partzuf %0a%3c big, is called the Light that elevates the Partzuf, for the lying position is called %0a%3c Ibur (embryo), the sitting position is called Katnut (small), and the standing %0a%3c position— Gadlut (big). %0a%3c %0a%3c 94. He slew two— Ariel and Moav (Moab). Two Holy Temples existed thanks %0a%3c to Atik and received from it: the First Temple and the Second Temple. Since %0a%3c Atik's disappearance, the process that stemmed from Above had ceased. It is %0a%3c as though he struck and destroyed them. %0a%3c %0a%3c Only Malchut de Malchut must be corrected, and nothing else. All the other %0a%3c properties do not require correction. This Malchut de Malchut is Malchut of Olam %0a%3c Ein Sof (the World of Infinity), Behina Dalet, Nukva de ZA or Partzuf BON— the %0a%3c Creator's only creation, the will to receive (pleasure) for oneself. It is this desire %0a%3c that caused the breaking of the Kelim (vessels)— the sin of Adam. %0a%3c %0a%3c And all the work of the righteous during the 6,000 years concerns the %0a%3c correction of Malchut, so she becomes precisely as she was prior to the breaking %0a%3c of the Kelim and the sin of Adam. As a result, the great Zivug on T^imt^um Aleph %0a%3c in Rosh de Atik will be revealed. The Light of this Zivug enables man to sort and %0a%3c separate his impure desires from the pure ones, and thus forever rid himself of %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Donkey Driver %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 245 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c the impure egoistic forces. This is exactly what Prophet Yeshayahu writes about: %0a%3c "He will eradicate death forever" (Yeshayahu, 25:8). %0a%3c %0a%3c Since Malchut, Partzuf BON of the world of Atzilut, is completely corrected %0a%3c already and does not require any further corrections, her Partzuf BON ascends %0a%3c to the level of Partzuf SAG of the world of AK. Thus, Malchut completely attains %0a%3c the properties of Bina. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, meanwhile, after the great Zivug in Atilc, but before the ascent of %0a%3c Partzuf BON to SAG, the Light of Atilc stops shining. As a result, the two Temples %0a%3c were destroyed. The two temples are the two Lights of Hochma: the Light of AVI, %0a%3c Ohr Hochma de Haya that shines in the First Temple, and the Light of YESHSUT, %0a%3c Ohr Neshama that shines in the Second Temple. And all the Light that Israel %0a%3c received from Atilc disappears. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, all these destructions and disappearances of Light are corrections %0a%3c and milestones on the path to deliverance and complete correction. They signify %0a%3c not devastation, but creation of perfection, as they are precisely those final %0a%3c corrections that bring BON back to SAG. %0a%3c %0a%3c Since all the roots and sources of what transpires in this world exist in the %0a%3c spiritual realm, and must all manifest once in our world, every spiritual ro %0a%3c must "touch" its branch in our world, and it does not matter when this oo %0a%3c In the spiritual world, everything unfolds in accordance with a strict cause-an %0a%3c effect process, whereas in our world those same consequences can manifest at a %0a%3c completely different time. %0a%3c %0a%3c An example of this is the destruction of the First and the Second Temples. %0a%3c While this event has already transpired in our world, in the spiritual world it %0a%3c occurs only when the last stage of correction is attained. Due to the complexity %0a%3c of time-transcending notions, we will examine this matter in another book. %0a%3c However, one way or another, only our inner spiritual properties can become the %0a%3c Temple in which we will feel the Creator and in which He will forever dwell! %0a%3c %0a%3c At the end of correction, Ohr Haya and Ohr Neshama will be called the %0a%3c First and the Second Temples, respectively. Also, until the end of correction, %0a%3c Ohr Haya, which is received on the Zivug of Malchut and included in Yesod, is %0a%3c led Shahhat (Sabbath), while Ohr Neshama is called Hoi (weekdays). As wi %0a%3c ere is absolutely no connection between these Lights and the %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c After the destruction of the spiritual Temples (the disappearance of Light), %0a%3c they will be recreated from Above by the screen of Bina, called "Heaven." This is %0a%3c because the screen of Partzuf SAG is a property of absolute mercy and is completely %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 246 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c unrestricted in its actions, desiring only to bestow and refrain from receiving Ohr %0a%3c Hochma. Thus, it is beyond the influence of any restrictions and limitations. %0a%3c %0a%3c As a result of this Zivug, the two Temples will be restored forever, and "the %0a%3c Light of the Moon (Malchut) shall be as the Light of the Sun (Bina)" (Yeshayahu, %0a%3c 30:26). The Light of Bina, which is now the Light of ZA (called "the sun"), %0a%3c will be seven times more powerful, as ZAT de Atik. From there, this Light will %0a%3c descend to AVI and create the first seven days of creation, for ZA (the sun) will %0a%3c become like AB and contain the Light of Guf de Atik. Malchut will become like %0a%3c ZA and receive his Light, the Light of the sun. %0a%3c %0a%3c At the end of correction, a Zivug on Malchut herself (the primordial, but %0a%3c corrected egoism) will transpire, and all the particular Zivugim that were made %0a%3c on all the Lights through the 6,000 years (made not on Malchut, but on her %0a%3c inclusion in Yesod) will thereby disappear. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Temple will be restored from Heaven, for Bina herself does not wish to %0a%3c receive Ohr Hochma. And it will not occur because she cannot, but because she %0a%3c does not want to. This degree is referred to as "in the hands of Heaven." For %0a%3c example, it is written in the blessing on the new moon: "Life, which contains %0a%3c the fear of Heaven, and the fear of sinning." This life is above our reasoning and %0a%3c desires, for it is said that faith must be "above reason"; otherwise, sins will ensue. %0a%3c %0a%3c Thus, one desires nothing more than to go by faith above his reason and %0a%3c desires, for he is afraid to sin. However, there exists an even Higher Degree: when %0a%3c he no longer fears sinning, as he now has a screen, but still prefers to proceed by %0a%3c faith above reason and desires, for he yearns to be dissolved in the Upper One. %0a%3c %0a%3c The reason for the Light's disappearance from Guf de Atik prior to these %0a%3c corrections is that the two Malchu^ot (Bina and Malchut, called SAG and BON) %0a%3c no longer exist. After the great Zivug of Atik, BON were annulled along with %0a%3c the screen of SAG, as Guf de Atik contains the connection between Bina and %0a%3c Malchut, designed for their interaction during the 6,000 years. %0a%3c %0a%3c As a result of such interaction between Bina and Malchut, an opportunity %0a%3c arises to partially, gradually correct Malchut. In this mutual Zivug with Malchut, %0a%3c which is merged with Bina (Bina's properties), Atik first creates AA and then all %0a%3c the other Partzufim of the worlds of Atzilut and BYA. %0a%3c %0a%3c And since the screen of Malchut (Masach de BON) now disappears, the %0a%3c screen of Bina (Masach de SAG) disappears as well, as they are merged together. %0a%3c In the absence of Malchut and the screen, this Zivug stops, and all the Light of %0a%3c Guf de Atik emanating from this Zivug on the mutual screen of Malchut and %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Donkey Driver %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 247 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Bina disappears. Therefore, all the Light that descended from its Guf (called %0a%3c Temples) disappeared. %0a%3c %0a%3c In Rosh de Atik there is a Zivug on Malchut of Tzimtzum Aleph. Merged with %0a%3c Bina and existing for 6,000 years, the screen of Malchut disappears. As a result, %0a%3c the Light disappears as well. Malchut has yet to ascend to SAG to receive her %0a%3c perfection, as there is still no new Light. This complete absence of Light is called %0a%3c "destruction." However, Malchut then receives the Light of AVI, and the worlds %0a%3c of BYA merge with the world of Atzilut. %0a%3c %0a%3c 95. And the Holy Throne (Malchut) is overthrown. Hence, the prophet %0a%3c Yechezkel (Ezekiel) wrote, "I am in exile," signifying that the degree called %0a%3c "I," which is Malchut, is in exile. Why? "By the river Kevar." Kevar %0a%3c (already) is the river that had already existed, but has now disappeared. As it %0a%3c is written, "The river is destroyed and dried up." It was "destroyed" in the %0a%3c first Temple and "dried up" in the second. Hence, it is written: "He struck %0a%3c and destroyed both, Ariel and Moav." Moav (or Mi Aw) means "from the %0a%3c Heavenly Father." They were all destroyed for Him, and all the Light that %0a%3c shone upon Israel disappeared. %0a%3c %0a%3c The word Kursa, derived from the word Kisse (throne) or Kissuy (cover) %0a%3c signifies the combination of the properties of Malchut and Bina, which leads %0a%3c to the Light descending to BYA during the 6,000 years. The Holy Throne is %0a%3c overthrown, because the screen of Bina (Kisse) has been annulled, as it is said, "I %0a%3c am in exile," where "I" designates Malchut. %0a%3c %0a%3c The entire spiritual complex is structured like a ladder, where Malchut of %0a%3c the Upper Partzuf becomes (descends to) the Keter of the lower one. This is also %0a%3c indicated in the names: Malchut is called "I" (Ani = Aleph-Nun-Yod) and Keter is %0a%3c called "no" (Ein = Aleph-Yod-Nun), as it is completely unattainable. Only that %0a%3c which is perceived within Malchut can be attained; hence, it is called "I." %0a%3c %0a%3c Only Malckut of the Upper Partzuf acts as a link between the Partzufim: the %0a%3c Upper One makes a Zivug on its Malchut, creates Ohr Hozer, and receives (clothes) %0a%3c the Upper Light within it, and then Malchut of the Upper One descends to the %0a%3c lower Partzuf in the form of Ohr Hozer. This state of the Upper One clothing in %0a%3c the lower one is called the exile of the Upper One, for the Zivug with the Upper %0a%3c Light disappears from it, and the Upper Light disappears from all the Partzufim. %0a%3c And the river dries up— the corrected screen is called the "river," for it causes the %0a%3c Upper Light's descent to the lower ones. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, now that the screen (river) disappears, the descent of the Upper %0a%3c Light disappears as well. The destruction of the river in the First Temple causes %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 248 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c the disappearance of Ohr Haya; the river in the Second Temple dries up, and %0a%3c Ohr Neshama vanishes along with it. The river in the First Temple is destroyed %0a%3c because the Zivug in AVI is stopped; the Light in YESHSUT is exhausted, and %0a%3c the river in the Second Temple dries up. %0a%3c %0a%3c The source of Ohr Haya and Neshama is Aba, called the "Heavenly Father," for %0a%3c he shines in ZA, called "Heaven," with the Light that elevates ZON to YESHSUT %0a%3c (the Second Temple) and to AVI (the First Temple). Because the Light stops %0a%3c shining from Guf de Atik, all of the Light descending to Israel disappears. This %0a%3c refers not only to the Light of the two Temples, but to all of the Light shining %0a%3c upon Israel, including Ohr VAK and the Light in the worlds of BYA. %0a%3c %0a%3c 96. Further, He descended and struck the lion. Initially, when this river %0a%3c rolled its waters down, Israel was in a state of perfection, for they offered %0a%3c up gifts and sacrifices to atone for their sins and to save their souls. Then, the %0a%3c image of a lion would descend from Above, and they would see it on the %0a%3c altar as it trampled the bodies of the sacrifices, devouring them, and all the %0a%3c dogs (all those who slander Israel) would fall to silence. %0a%3c %0a%3c The fire that consumes the sacrifices laid on the Temple altar resembled %0a%3c a lion, and towered over the sacrifices, like a lion (Talmud, Yoma, 21:2), and %0a%3c that fire burned the sacrifices laid down by the sons of Israel. However, this is a %0a%3c corporeal image that a regular person perceives in our world. %0a%3c %0a%3c But we shall follow our higher analysis and detach ourselves from this %0a%3c corporeal image; we will explain the action in the spiritual world that this %0a%3c language actually alludes to. All the languages in the Torah, including that which %0a%3c describes a rather corporeal image of sacrifice, speak only of spiritual actions. %0a%3c The most precise language for the description of these actions is the language of %0a%3c Kabbalah. However, this language is clear only to those who have ascended to %0a%3c the spiritual worlds and see both the roots, i.e., the events that transpire in the %0a%3c spiritual worlds, as well as their corporeal consequences. %0a%3c %0a%3c Before the Light of Atik disappeared, when the Upper Light still shone upon %0a%3c Israel, like a river rolling its waters, Israel was in a state of perfection: by means %0a%3c of sacrifice, it raised its MAN (request), thus evoking a Zivug on its screen, and %0a%3c MAD (the Light, abundance) descends on it. As a result of these actions, it grew %0a%3c closer to the Heavenly Father, and all the impure forces distanced from it, for it %0a%3c purified its souls, and purification signifies distancing from the impure forces %0a%3c (desires), the way a soiled garment is cleansed from dirt. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, the Hebrew word for sacrifice is Korban, derived from the word %0a%3c Karov (near). Thus, sacrifice signifies a person tearing away a part of his inner %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Donkey Driver %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 249 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c animal egoism for the sake of drawing closer to the Creator. This is what brings %0a%3c Israel closer to their Heavenly Father. %0a%3c %0a%3c And since Israel existed in perfection and raised MAN for the Creator's %0a%3c pleasure alone, its MAN would ascend to Bina. The Light of Bina is called Ohr %0a%3c Hassadim, and its form resembles the image of a lion, like the property of bestowal, %0a%3c Hesed. This means that the lion-Bina receives Israel's good desires and deeds. And %0a%3c it was seen how Bina consumes Israel's MAN— Ohr Hassadim descends from Bina %0a%3c onto this MAN, like a lion trampling his prey (MAN) and devouring it. %0a%3c %0a%3c A lion devouring its prey is the principal aspect of sacrifice, for it signifies %0a%3c raising MAN to strengthen a screen and create Ohr Hozer. And since the %0a%3c magnitude of the received Ohr Yashar is determined by the magnitude (height) %0a%3c of Ohr Hozer, which creates the screen, it follows that existence and growth of %0a%3c Ohr Yashar is dependent on the Ohr Hozer. The greater the Ohr Hozer, the greater %0a%3c the descending Ohr Yashar becomes. %0a%3c %0a%3c In other words, to the extent that every one of us desires to "bestow," he %0a%3c evokes a corresponding response from Above, from the root of his soul. And just %0a%3c as in our world a living being's life and strength depend on nutrition (it simply dies %0a%3c without it), the Upper Light depends on the Light reflected by the screen. When it %0a%3c stops, the Upper Light disappears from the Partzuf, i.e., man stops feeling it. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Upper Light descends from Bina as Ohr Yashar (called a "lion"), i.e., in %0a%3c the form of "bestowal," in accordance with Bina 's nature. And man sees (feels!) %0a%3c how Ohr Yashar clothes in Ohr Hozer, which ascends from its sacrifice (rejection %0a%3c of egoism), the lion's nourishment. %0a%3c %0a%3c It devours its prey and thereby grows: the extent of Israel's perfection and %0a%3c their ability to offer sacrifices, to "bestow," determines the magnitude of their %0a%3c MAN and the force with which the Ohr Yashar strikes the screen, which reflects %0a%3c the Direct Light (pleasure) from below upwards with all its might. Moreover, it %0a%3c does so in great fear: for what if it fails to reflect the Light and desires to enjoy %0a%3c the Light of this commandment selfishly? %0a%3c %0a%3c That is precisely where one's work lies. It is called "faith above reason," for %0a%3c it must rise above one's reason (egoism) and intellect. Conversely, those who %0a%3c ceive inner confidence that it is enough to advance within one's nature ar %0a%3c cred still," a pure inanimate (non-developing) being, as such re %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, if the height of Ohr Hozer is great, it is defined as a lion that tears %0a%3c and devours its prey, as a victor, for it grows and ascends to a higher spiritual %0a%3c level thanks to the efforts of the lower one (man). %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 250 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The impure force, the selfish will to receive pleasure is called "a dog," as it %0a%3c is written: "The leech has two daughters (who demand): Give-give." (Mishley, %0a%3c 30:15). They bark like a dog, and demand (to receive) both this world and the %0a%3c next. And the Higher One ascends, the stronger this impure force, called Klipa, %0a%3c becomes. And its strongest part corresponds to Ohr Yechida, opposite the lion %0a%3c devouring its prey). %0a%3c %0a%3c The lion represents mercy and bestowal, unwillingness to receive anything %0a%3c for oneself. As it is written in The Ethics of the Fathers, 95: "A Chassid, the merciful %0a%3c righteous one, says, 'What's yours is yours, and what's mine is yours,'" so is the %0a%3c impure force (dog) aimed wholly at reception, and has no aspiration to bestow. %0a%3c As it is said in the Talmud (Bava Batra, 10:2), "The righteous among the nations %0a%3c of the world: all their mercy is for themselves alone;" hence, they are connected %0a%3c to the impure force of a dog. (Under no circumstances should any of this be %0a%3c interpreted literally, for, as it was repeatedly explained, the whole of the Kabbalah %0a%3c speaks only of man's-prototype. Israel is one's inner aspiration to the Creator, %0a%3c and Goy (a gentile) signifies egoism (regardless of and unrelated to one's origin). %0a%3c Relate this to the above-mentioned corporeal and spiritual Temples, where there %0a%3c is no connection between rocks and spiritual objects. It is also unclear to the %0a%3c uninitiated why altruism is the property of a lion, while a dog, a loyal animal, is %0a%3c the root of egoism and impurity). %0a%3c %0a%3c It is therefore said that when Israel was perfect, it acquired the property of a %0a%3c lion, and all the dogs left it be, for it gave Malchut the strength to raise Ohr Hozer %0a%3c to great heights (devoured its prey, like a victor), and the impure force, like a %0a%3c dog, was afraid to come near it, and would hide in fear of the lion. %0a%3c %0a%3c 97. Yet, when sins increased, he descended to the lower degrees and slew the %0a%3c lion. This was because the lion refused to give up its prey as before, and this %0a%3c is as though he killed it. Therefore, he struck the lion and threw it into a pit, %0a%3c to the Evil Side (according to his understanding). The Evil Side saw this and %0a%3c sent a dog to devour the sacrifices from the altar in the lion's stead. What is %0a%3c the name of that lion? And what is the nickname of that dog? Baladan is its %0a%3c name; Baladan is formed by the words Bal'Adam, where the letter Mem is %0a%3c replaced by Nun, for he is not a human being at all, but a dog, and his face is %0a%3c like a muzzle of a dog. %0a%3c %0a%3c ("He" refers to Benayahu Ben Yehoyada Ben Ish Chai, Rav Paalim u Mekabtziel, %0a%3c in whom the degree of Atik, all of the Light, shines all at once.) Due to the %0a%3c disappearance of the screens of Malchut (BON) and Bina (SAG), Israel below could %0a%3c no longer raise MAN (the will to "bestow," the screen, the lion's nourishment). %0a%3c The Zivug stopped, and the Upper Light (lion) disappeared in its Root Above. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Donkey Driver %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 251 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c "Threw it into a pit"— the root of the desire to receive for one's own sake %0a%3c is in the eyes, as Rashi said: "The eye sees, and the heart burns with desire" %0a%3c (The weekly portion Shlach). This will to receive for oneself is called an "empty, %0a%3c waterless pit" (Beresheet, 37:24). The Upper Light does not fill it. Although it is %0a%3c empty, it is unworthy of being a vessel for the Light, as it is written: "He and I %0a%3c cannot dwell in the same abode" (Talmud, Suta, 5). %0a%3c %0a%3c Thus, the lion was thrown into a pit, for it was struck before the eyes of %0a%3c the impure egoistic force, called an "empty, waterless pit." And these pits now %0a%3c emerge from their hideouts and reveal their power, and in place of a lion appears %0a%3c a barking dog. %0a%3c %0a%3c ZA-MA = 45 is called Adam = Aleph + Dalet + Mem = 1 + 4 + 40 = 45, when %0a%3c he receives the Light from Bina. The property of Bina is bestowal. Hence, it is %0a%3c written: "Man is your name" (Talmud, Yevamot, 61), referring only to those who %0a%3c attain the property of bestowal, but not to the others, of whom it is said: "Even %0a%3c their mercy is only for their profit" (Talmud, Bava Batra, 10:2), and who are %0a%3c therefore called Baladan (Bal-Adan). %0a%3c %0a%3c 98. On a day of snow, on the day misfortunes descend from the Supernal %0a%3c Court Above, it is written, "Her household shall not fear snow," that is, the %0a%3c Supernal Court, called "snow." For her household is clothed twofold, and can %0a%3c thereby endure a strong fire. So the book says. %0a%3c %0a%3c Strictness, judgment (Din) or restriction imposed on the use of egoism in the %0a%3c male part is called "snow" that stems from the Supernal Court. These restrictions %0a%3c are very powerful, but are mitigated below the Chazeh, where Malchut receives %0a%3c them. Nulcva describes these restrictions in the following way: "Surround me %0a%3c with roses," (Shir HaShirim, 2) referring to two fires: the Upper— Bina, and the %0a%3c lower, her own— Malchut. %0a%3c %0a%3c After Malchut acquires these two fires, she weakens the strictness of the cold %0a%3c snow with her fire. Hence, it is written in Shir HaShirim (Song of Songs) that %0a%3c her household shall not fear snow (the Supernal Court), i.e., the restrictions %0a%3c imposed on the male part, for her household is clothed twofold. In other words, %0a%3c on the contrary, the snow helps her withstand the heat of her fire. And only %0a%3c now that the screen and Zivug are gone, and the two fires are no more, the %0a%3c restrictions of the snow return. %0a%3c %0a%3c 99. What is written next? "And he struck an Egyptian." This refers to a secret: %0a%3c every time Israel sinned, the Creator would conceal Himself and restrict them %0a%3c from receiving all the goodness and all the Light that He shone upon them. %0a%3c "He struck an Egyptian." "He" refers to Moshe, the Light that shines upon %0a%3c Israel. For in Egypt he was born, grew up, and attained the Supernal Light. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 252 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Torah speaks not of man, but of the Light that disappeared and %0a%3c concealed itself. Hence, it is defined as "slain." Gone is the great Light, with %0a%3c which Moshe shone upon Israel. And this Light is called the "Egyptian," for %0a%3c in Egypt Moshe was born, grew up, and attained the great Supernal Light, the %0a%3c Light that delivered Israel from Egypt. %0a%3c %0a%3c 100. A man of mirror. It is written, mirror and man, as it is written, a Godly %0a%3c man, the husband of that mirror, of the Creator's glory, Malchut. For with %0a%3c this degree he merited ruling over the entire land in all of his desire— a feat %0a%3c unmatched by any other. %0a%3c %0a%3c The difference between Moshe and the other prophets is that Moshe is the %0a%3c foundation of ZA, as he constructs and passes the Light from ZA to Malchut, %0a%3c whereas the other prophets are the foundation of Malchut, and receive from %0a%3c her. Hence, it is written of him: "Godly man," the husband of Malchut, called %0a%3c the "Creator's greatness." And why is Moshe called the husband of Malchut 7 . %0a%3c Because he attained the level of ZA and gives the Light to Malchut. Therefore, it %0a%3c is written that his attainments are beyond anyone else's, for the other prophets %0a%3c receive from Malchut, and are therefore ruled by her. %0a%3c %0a%3c He who attains Malchut receives from her. The degree called Moshe means %0a%3c that he who attains it gives the Light to Malchut, instead of receiving from her. %0a%3c Yet, how can this be? How can one possibly rise above Malchut if all our souls %0a%3c originate from her and exist in the worlds of BYA? This indicates the state of %0a%3c ascent above Malchut, which is how Moshe ascends to Bina. %0a%3c %0a%3c 101. This is the Creator's staff that was delivered to him, as it is written, %0a%3c "With the Creator's staff in my hand." This is the staff that was created on %0a%3c the evening of the sixth day of the creation, before Shabbat. And His Holy %0a%3c Name is contained in it. And with this staff Moshe sinned by striking it %0a%3c twice against the rock. The Creator said to him: "Moshe, it is not for this %0a%3c purpose that I have not given you My staff; thus, it will no longer be in your %0a%3c possession henceforth." %0a%3c %0a%3c The words "evening" and "twilight" signify the state of mitigation of Malchut 's %0a%3c strictness by the properties of Bina to an extent that it becomes impossible to %0a%3c distinguish Malchut from Bina. This is because on Shahhat, Malchut ascends to %0a%3c AVI and becomes Bina. However, on the twilight of Shabbat, Malchut is not %0a%3c yet Bina, but is no longer Malchut (everything in the book speaks only of the %0a%3c properties of spiritual objects, for nothing but desires exists in the spiritual %0a%3c worlds. Only in our world are desires clothed in physical bodies). %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Donkey Driver %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 253 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, it is said that ten things were created in the twilight, when there is no %0a%3c distinction between the thing itself and its origin, Bina or Malchut, for Malchut %0a%3c herself shows no distinction. And such is the property of the staff that was created %0a%3c in the twilight, before the world's first Shabbat. Hence, it possesses the holy (special) %0a%3c property of the Creator's name, an allusion to the properties of Bina, from which %0a%3c holiness (altruism) descends. And Malchut is ready to receive this holiness. %0a%3c %0a%3c And these two properties of Bina and Malchut are contained in the Creator's %0a%3c staff, utterly indistinguishable from one another, for they were created in the %0a%3c twilight. Hence, with the help of this staff, i.e., by means of the property of %0a%3c uniting Malchut with Bina, all the fortunes and wonders, all of the Light can be %0a%3c brought to Israel, for this is the purpose behind the Light's descent from Bina %0a%3c to Malchut. With the help of this property (the staff), Moshe merited an ascent %0a%3c to Bina, up to the degree of "Godly man." Therefore, the staff is called the %0a%3c Creator's staff, according to the name of Bina. %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut is called Tzur (rock), and upon ascending to Bina, she is called Sela %0a%3c (another name for a rock). The inner Zivug between ZON (ZA and Malchut) in %0a%3c the state of their ascent to AVI, when Nukva uses Ima's Kelim, is called "speech." %0a%3c The outer Zivug between ZON, when they are in their own place, is called "Zivug %0a%3c de Hakaa" (a Zivug by Striking). %0a%3c %0a%3c It is hence written to Moshe in the weekly Torah portion Bashalach: "You %0a%3c shall strike the rock (Tzur), and it shall bring forth water" (Shemot, 17:6), for %0a%3c a Zivug de Hakaa occurs within Malchut herself. However, it is written in the %0a%3c weekly portion Chulcat: "Speak ye unto the rock before all eyes, that it give forth %0a%3c its water" (Bamidbar, 20:8), for the "rock" is in Bina, and the Zivug within her is %0a%3c called "speech." %0a%3c %0a%3c And herein lies the sin of Moshe: he struck twice: in addition to first %0a%3c striking the Tzur, he struck the Sela, which lacks the strike, and only has a %0a%3c Zivug in the form of speech. Since there is no distinction in the Creator's staff, %0a%3c and it is unclear whether it refers to Malchut or to Bina, he also applied it to %0a%3c Sela-Bina. And the Creator told him that the staff was given to him to use with %0a%3c Tzur, but not with Sela. %0a%3c %0a%3c 102. At once He descended to him in strictness and wrenched the staff from %0a%3c the Egyptian's hand, for the moment the staff was taken from him, it was %0a%3c taken for good. And he was killed by it: because of the sin of striking the rock %0a%3c with the staff, he died and did not enter the Holy Land. And that Light was %0a%3c concealed from Israel. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 254 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c It was already mentioned in item 94 that as a result of a great Zivug in %0a%3c Atik, only BON were supposed to disappear, but not SAG, for BON could have %0a%3c immediately risen and forever become like SAG. However, as SAG and BON %0a%3c were merged, SAG disappeared together with BON. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Light of Moshe disappeared from Israel for the same reason— because %0a%3c he committed an even greater sin and harmed the union of BON and SAG by %0a%3c striking the Sela. Hence, harsh judgment descended upon him, which refers to %0a%3c the disappearance of the Light of SAG. Indeed, SAG is no longer connected to %0a%3c BON in any way, and the annulment of BON has no influence on it. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is the meaning of what is written in Psalms: "He resembled those who %0a%3c draw axes at a copse of trees, but now all of his adornments are smashed by %0a%3c hatchets and axes" (Tehilim, 74:5). Due to Malchut's ascent to Bina, and her %0a%3c correction there, Malchut is like a "copse of trees," for SAG, too, is annulled by %0a%3c the merging with BON, Malchut's ascent, as if struck with "hatchets and axes." %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, it is written that the staff was taken from the Egyptian, and will %0a%3c never return to him, for the staff refers to Malchut. So the Light disappears for %0a%3c good, because BON renews itself afterwards and becomes SAG forever. Thus, it %0a%3c is no longer necessary to use the staff for striking. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is written in this regard that he was slain by the same staff, for had he %0a%3c been careful and used it only once— striking the Tzur, but not the Sela— SAG %0a%3c would not have been annulled together with BON, and he would not have died. %0a%3c Instead, he would have immediately risen to SAG. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is why it is written that Moshe shall not enter the Holy Land, Israel, as %0a%3c Israel is BON in the state of ascent to SAG, and it is called the Holy Land, for %0a%3c the Light of Bina (called the Holy Light) shines in it. However, until the end of %0a%3c correction arrives, there are still ascents and descents, which cause destructions %0a%3c (disappearance of the Light) and revelations (shining of the Light). But at the %0a%3c end of correction, BON will remain within SAG permanently as Eretz Israel, and %0a%3c there shall be no more exiles from it. %0a%3c %0a%3c 103. "The most respected of the thirty" refers to the Upper One that receives %0a%3c from Above and passes downward, one that receives and brings closer. %0a%3c However, he does not go to the first three, but they come to him and give to %0a%3c him wholeheartedly, but he does not come to them. %0a%3c %0a%3c GAR (HBD) are called "thirty," as each of the three Sefirot HBD consists of %0a%3c ten, which amounts to thirty. And their Light shines in all of the 6,000 years. %0a%3c The soul of Benayahu appears out of the great Zivug of Atik, which accumulates %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Donkey Driver %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 255 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c all the Zivugim during the 6,000 years. Hence, it is called Rav Paalim (performing %0a%3c many actions) and Mekabtziel (gathering all into one degree-Part^u/, called %0a%3c Benayahu Ben Yehoyada). %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, he receives the Light of all of the Supernal Thirty, which descends %0a%3c to his soul. Indeed, he consists of particular Zivugim that have transpired through %0a%3c the 6,000 years, which he gathers into one. And, although they give him the %0a%3c best of their properties wholeheartedly, he still cannot draw closer to them and %0a%3c subsequently receive from them. This is because the disappearance of the screen %0a%3c in ZON made the screen in SAG disappear as well. Hence, he cannot come to %0a%3c them, raise MAN, and receive from them further. %0a%3c %0a%3c 104. Despite not being considered one of them, David heard the meaning %0a%3c that is never detached from the heart, for they can never be separated. David %0a%3c paid attention with all his heart, but he did not pay attention to David. For by %0a%3c the praises, hymns, and mercy that the moon offers the sun, the moon draws %0a%3c the sun closer so as to be with it. %0a%3c %0a%3c David is Malchut; Malchut comes from the word Melech (King). Therefore, %0a%3c David is King, for his properties are the properties of Malchut (kingdom). %0a%3c And this is the fourth leg (support) of GAR. Hence, it is written that although %0a%3c he cannot be together with the thirty (GAR), he nonetheless clings to these %0a%3c properties, and never detaches himself from them. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is because Malchut's entire perfection is revealed in him, for it stems %0a%3c from the great Zivug of Atik, which destroys all the impure forces of BON, as it is %0a%3c said: "He destroys evil forever." %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, David resolved to never part with it again, for it is his perfection. %0a%3c However, Benayahu Ben Yehoyada paid no attention to David, as David is the %0a%3c fourth support of GAR. Hence, it is as though he is unable to receive from GAR. %0a%3c And since he cannot receive from David, he pays no attention to him. %0a%3c %0a%3c With the help of the MAN of Malchut (called Se'ara— stormy wind), which %0a%3c is raised to ZA (called "Heaven"), as a result of the hymns, praises, and mercy, %0a%3c Malchut receives the Light of Benayahu Ben Yehoyada's soul, which is absolute %0a%3c perfection, and merges with it for all eternity. %0a%3c %0a%3c 105. Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Aba fell down on their faces before him and could %0a%3c not see him anymore, then rose and went in every direction, but could not %0a%3c see him. They sat and wept, and could not even speak to one another. Then, %0a%3c Rabbi Aba said, "It is true what we have learned, that the Torah accompanies %0a%3c the righteous on all their paths. The righteous of the other world come to %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 256 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c them to reveal to them the secrets of the Torah. And this must have been %0a%3c Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba, who came to us from the other world to reveal these %0a%3c secrets to us. But before we could recognize him, he vanished." They rose and %0a%3c wanted to lead their donkeys on, but could not. They repeatedly tried to goad %0a%3c the donkeys, but still they could not move. They grew frightened and left their %0a%3c donkeys behind. And to this day this place is called "the place of donkeys." %0a%3c %0a%3c Because they could not bear such a powerful Light, which was revealed to %0a%3c them upon the disclosure of those secrets, they fell (Katnut) and then rose (Gadlut), %0a%3c for it was so unbearable. After they merited receiving from it such a great degree, %0a%3c this Light disappeared at once and did not reappear, and they could not attain it %0a%3c anymore. Hence, they wept (a kind of Katnut) out of great grief that they had lost %0a%3c such exalted attainment, and they could not speak (absence of Kelim). %0a%3c %0a%3c The bitterness of their loss made them realize that it was the degree of %0a%3c Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba himself, and not lower, as they had mistakenly thought %0a%3c before. The forces that they received from the soul of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba are %0a%3c called "donkeys," with which they can raise MAN, the request to attain Higher %0a%3c Degrees, Haya and Yechida. %0a%3c %0a%3c In other words, the soul is a spiritual force of Light; like a pulling force of %0a%3c a donkey that helps overcome egoistic desires and move from place to place in %0a%3c the spiritual world, onto a Higher Degree. To raise MAN means to feel what is %0a%3c lacking and what needs to be attained— this is what man's work is all about. %0a%3c %0a%3c Such is the work of a righteous soul— it helps man by lifting him up onto %0a%3c his donkey (egoism) and taking the lead (pulling) in order to illuminate (give %0a%3c strength) for him the path of the righteous. And now, when its role has been %0a%3c completed, this soul disappears, although they would have very much liked to %0a%3c continue ascending and riding its donkeys, i.e., they wished to raise MAN anew %0a%3c to return and attain once more. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, they could no longer receive the strength to raise MAN. Thus, %0a%3c they were struck by fear and left their donkeys in that place, which is hence %0a%3c called "the place of donkeys," for they could not use them any longer. %0a%3c %0a%3c 106. Rabbi Elazar opened and said: "Oh, how great is Your goodness, which %0a%3c You have hidden away for those who fear You! (Tehilim, 31:20). How infinite %0a%3c is the goodness that the Creator shall bestow on humankind in the future, %0a%3c on those sin-fearing, exalted righteous, who study the Torah as they arrive %0a%3c at that Upper World." %0a%3c %0a%3c The words "great goodness" refer to Gadlut, the attainment of the Light of %0a%3c GAR. For the basis of a Partzuf is its VAK— the amount of Light necessary for its %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Donkey Driver %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 257 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c existence, received from the Zivug of AVI, who make this Zivug and emit Ohr %0a%3c Hassadim, necessary to sustain the worlds. And all the extra Light, necessary %0a%3c for existence, is called GAR or Ohr Hochma— the additional, delectable and %0a%3c great Light. %0a%3c %0a%3c This Ohr Hochma, the Light of GAR, stems from Bina, which is called "the %0a%3c world to come." It is clothed in Ohr Hassadim that emerges from a Zivug of the %0a%3c Sefira Yesod (Chai Olamim— life of the worlds), and from there descends to the %0a%3c righteous who fear to sin. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zivug of AVI, when they are at the degree of Bina, gives Ohr Hassadim %0a%3c to ZA for the sustenance of the worlds. However, when AVI ascend to AA and %0a%3c beget new souls by their Zivug, their Zivug is inconstant, as it emits Ohr Hochma, %0a%3c called "new souls." %0a%3c %0a%3c 107. The name "great goodness" can be further described as containing all %0a%3c the secrets of the Supernal wisdom, which descend from ZA to Malchut. %0a%3c There is a great tree, called ZA or Rav (great, strong), and there is a small tree, %0a%3c Malchut, which grows from it. And it is elevated to the Highest Firmament. %0a%3c %0a%3c In addition to the attainment of the Light of GAR, there is also the inner %0a%3c part of the Supernal wisdom with its secrets, which become revealed in the %0a%3c Zivug of Atik at the completion of the 6,000 years, the end of correction. MA %0a%3c designates the lower world, Malchut. The great and strong tree is ZA in the state %0a%3c of ascent to Partzuf AB, as in this state he receives Ohr Hochma, and Hochma %0a%3c signifies strength (not "reason— strength" but the strength of Ohr Hochma lies in %0a%3c the fact that it allows one to go against reason, in defiance of common sense, in %0a%3c faith above reason). %0a%3c %0a%3c However, when ZA is in his place, he is simply called "a tree," for he lacks %0a%3c Ohr Hochma and has only VAK, Ohr Hassadim. Malchut is also called a tree and %0a%3c grows together with ZA; ZA ascends to Aba, to the utmost height, to the Supernal %0a%3c Firmament— Atik. %0a%3c %0a%3c 108. The "great goodness" is the Light that was created on the first day of %0a%3c creation and concealed so as to be revealed in the future for the righteous %0a%3c in the other world. Your Deeds are the Supernal Garden of Eden, which the %0a%3c Creator has created by His act. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Light that was created on the first day of creation is the Light in which %0a%3c Adam saw from one end of the world to the other. Hence, the word "Light" is %0a%3c used five times in the Torah's description of the first day of creation. This Light is %0a%3c intended for the righteous in the world to come, for it is concealed in Yesod de Aha %0a%3c and in Yesod de Ima, which are collectively called "righteousness and justice." %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 258 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c (In Hebrew, the words Tzedek— justice and Tzadik— righteous/just have the %0a%3c same root. This name is given to one who attains the Creator's governance and %0a%3c sees that His governance is just; hence, he justifies all of the Creator's actions, %0a%3c and is thus called righteous. The other meaning of the word 'righteous' refers to %0a%3c man's belief that the Creator is righteous, because in spirituality, one assumes the %0a%3c name of the degree one has attained. If he attains that the Creator is righteous %0a%3c by receiving this knowledge from the degree onto which he ascends, then he is %0a%3c already called by the name of that degree.) %0a%3c %0a%3c Ohr Hochma can be received only in "precious garments," called %0a%3c righteousness and justice, that is, only with these intentions. The above excerpt %0a%3c speaks of an open action, implying unrestricted diffusion of Light, as it will %0a%3c be after the end of all the corrections. In the Torah, such a state is called "the %0a%3c Supernal Garden of Eden." %0a%3c %0a%3c In the meantime, only the complete and perfect righteous ones, the souls %0a%3c of Benayahu Ben Yehoyada and others that merited reception of Light from the %0a%3c great Zivug of Atik, gather all the Light of the 6,000 years. These souls' place of %0a%3c rest is referred to as the Garden of Eden. %0a%3c %0a%3c There exists the lower Garden of Eden of earth, which is VAK, and the %0a%3c Supernal one, GAR. All the souls dwell in the lower Garden of Eden, and only %0a%3c on new moons and Sabbaths do they ascend to the Supernal Garden of Eden, %0a%3c and then return to their place. However, there are individual, special persons %0a%3c (souls), whose place is in the Supernal Garden of Eden. These are the souls of %0a%3c which Rabbi Shimon says: "I saw them ascending, but their numbers were few." %0a%3c %0a%3c 109. All the righteous stand in the lower Garden of Eden, clothed in precious %0a%3c adornments, similar in quality and form to those which they wore in this %0a%3c world, meaning in the same form as people in this world and according to %0a%3c man's actions in this world. They stand there and fly away through the air, %0a%3c ascend to the Assembly in the Supernal Garden of Eden, fly there and bathe %0a%3c in the dew of the pure river of Apharsemon (persimmon), then come down %0a%3c and fly below in the lower Garden of Eden. %0a%3c %0a%3c The main difference between GAR and ZAT with regard to both Partzufim %0a%3c and souls is that GAR (KHB) do not need the garment of Hassadim. They can %0a%3c receive Ohr Hochma as it is. However, Partzufim of VAK and the souls born %0a%3c from ZON, whose basis is VAK (Ohr Hochma clothed in Ohr Hassadim), can only %0a%3c receive Ohr Hochma when it is clothes in Ohr Hassadim. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Ruach de Tzadikim (spirit of the righteous) in the lower Garden of Eden %0a%3c is clothed in Ohr Hassadim, just as human souls in this world. And with the help %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Donkey Driver %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 259 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c of these precious garments, they can ascend to the Supernal Garden of Eden %0a%3c and there receive Ohr Hochma. Afterwards, they return to their place in the %0a%3c lower Garden of Eden, for that is their permanent place. %0a%3c %0a%3c They ascend by the power of Ohr Hassadim, called "air," and fly to the %0a%3c Supernal Garden of Eden to receive Ohr Hochma, called the river of Apharsemon. %0a%3c However, they cannot stay there, so they immediately descend from the Supernal %0a%3c Garden of Eden to the lower. The Zohar compares them to human souls, for %0a%3c both the Upper and the lower human souls need to receive the garment of Ohr %0a%3c Hassadim in order to correct themselves and ascend. %0a%3c %0a%3c 110. And sometimes these righteous appear as people in order to perform %0a%3c miracles, like celestial angels, just as we have seen the luminescence of the %0a%3c Upper Light, but did not merit to see and discover the wisdom's great secrets. %0a%3c %0a%3c DID NOT MERIT TO DISCOVER THE WISDOM'S GREAT SECRETS- %0a%3c for the donkey driver had left them and disappeared. There are special souls %0a%3c that abide in the Supernal Garden of Eden. They have risen so high that the %0a%3c souls from the lower Garden of Eden ascend to them only on new moons %0a%3c and Sabbaths, and, being unable to stay there, immediately descend to their %0a%3c permanent place. However, they are nonetheless similar to human souls, which %0a%3c descend from the Supernal Garden of Eden to this world and meet people, just %0a%3c like the angels that seldom descend to this world. %0a%3c %0a%3c Now they have seen the Light of the Supernal Luminary, the Light of Rabbi %0a%3c Hamnuna-Saba that descended on them from the highest point, the Supernal %0a%3c Garden of Eden, and was revealed before them in this world (while they are still %0a%3c living in this world). %0a%3c %0a%3c AS PEOPLE refers to the souls that abide in the lower Garden of Eden, %0a%3c which have the form of people, and the Light of the Supernal Garden of Eden %0a%3c influences them. They can receive this Light during their ascent on new moons %0a%3c and Sabbaths, whereupon they merit meeting the souls of the Supernal Garden %0a%3c of Eden, and then descend to their permanent place. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, one may also say that the words AS PEOPLE refer to the people %0a%3c of our corporeal world, while the souls from the Supernal Garden of Eden %0a%3c sometimes descend to this world and, like exalted angels, appear before the eyes %0a%3c of the righteous. %0a%3c %0a%3c 111. Rabbi Aba opened and said: "And he who is doomed said to his wife, %0a%3c 'We shall die, for I have seen the Creator.' Even though he was not aware of %0a%3c his actions, as it is written, 'He did not know that it was an angel'; however, %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 260 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c since it is written, 'Man shall not see Me and live,' we know that he has %0a%3c died. And we have merited this great Light to accompany us, and the world %0a%3c exists because the Creator Himself sent him to us, to reveal the secrets of His %0a%3c Supernal wisdom to us. How joyous is our share!" %0a%3c %0a%3c When the angel saw him who was doomed, he did not yet have the proper %0a%3c level of attainment; thus, the angel was unwilling to reveal his name. Yet, %0a%3c although he did not know and did not attain him, he still feared the words, %0a%3c "Man shall not see Me and live" (Shemot, 33:20). %0a%3c %0a%3c But we have merited complete attainment, for we came to know his name, %0a%3c Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba. And we live and exist in this world. It is therefore clear %0a%3c that the degree of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba is called "Show me Your glory" (Shemot, %0a%3c 33:18), Moshe's request of the Creator. %0a%3c %0a%3c But the Creator replied: "You cannot see My face, for man shall not see Me %0a%3c and live." From this we see that they have attained more than Moshe. This state %0a%3c is described by sages as, "There was no prophet more exalted than Moshe, but %0a%3c there was a sage" (Yalkut Shimoni, the end). It is also written: "A sage is preferred %0a%3c to a prophet" (Talmud, Bava Batra, 12:1). Thus, they have spiritually ascended to %0a%3c merit the appearance of such an exalted soul, while still being in this world. %0a%3c %0a%3c 112. They walked and came to a mountain. The sun had set. The branches %0a%3c of the tree on that mountain started rattling and singing. As they were still %0a%3c walking, they heard a resounding voice proclaim, "Sons of the Holy Creator, %0a%3c dispersed among the living in this world, illuminated by the sons of the %0a%3c Assembly, gather in your places and rejoice with your Creator in the Torah." %0a%3c They grew frightened and stopped, then sat down. %0a%3c %0a%3c "They came to a mountain" refers to the words of King David, who said %0a%3c (Tehilim, 24:3): "Who shall ascend the mountain of the Lord, and who shall %0a%3c stand in His holy place?" meaning who is worthy of it? After they climbed %0a%3c the mountain, the sun had set (the Light left the Partzuf). But they heard %0a%3c something from the trees, as it is written: "Then shall all the trees of the wood %0a%3c sing for joy" (Tehilim, 96:12). %0a%3c %0a%3c They heard a voice that told them to return to their place, rejoice in the %0a%3c Creator and His Torah, and descend from the mountain. And it calls them by %0a%3c the name of that High Degree, which they've achieved. But it hints that people %0a%3c are not worthy of being at that degree and in this world simultaneously. Yet, %0a%3c although they were frightened, they remained on the mountain, sat down, and %0a%3c did not move. "Grew frightened," "stopped," and "sat down" are the spiritual %0a%3c states of the Partzuf. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Donkey Driver %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 261 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c We see how The Zohar explains the path of the righteous, those who cross %0a%3c the Machsom (the barrier that separates our world from the spiritual) and start %0a%3c ascending the rungs of the spiritual ladder. This path is diverse, and each book %0a%3c of the Torah describes it in its own way: the language of Kabbalah, legends, %0a%3c judicial laws, historical accounts of the Pentateuch, etc.. The Zohar draws a vivid %0a%3c picture for us— like a guidebook for those who will find themselves in the place %0a%3c of these exalted travelers in the spiritual world. Once there, you will see for %0a%3c yourselves what is implied by such notions as "mountain," "tree," and "voice." %0a%3c Then The Zohar will become your true guidebook! %0a%3c %0a%3c It is impossible to provide a more detailed description of the Partzufim, i.e., %0a%3c an inner perception of one who ascends spiritually. This is because the reader %0a%3c must first have certain analogous sensations of his own. If one could see only %0a%3c once what the described content (or something similar) really means, one would %0a%3c be able to clearly imagine what it speaks of. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is the same in our world: even if we have never been to a certain country, %0a%3c we can imagine what others describe to us by analogy with what we already %0a%3c know. But in this case, there is no analogy. One who sees the spiritual world %0a%3c for the first time realizes how wrong all of his previous visualizations have been! %0a%3c Hence, we can say nothing about many of the states described in The Zohar. %0a%3c %0a%3c 113. Meanwhile, a voice called out again, "O, mighty rocks, great hammers of %0a%3c thunder, Bina stands upon a pillar, so enter and assemble." At that moment, %0a%3c they heard the mighty voice of thousands of trees, which was saying, "The %0a%3c Creator's voice breaks the cedars." Both Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Aba fell %0a%3c down on their faces. Great fear fell upon them. They rose hastily and left, not %0a%3c hearing anything else, then came down the mountain and kept on walking. %0a%3c %0a%3c It was previously said that they could not load their donkeys, meaning that %0a%3c they were unable to raise MAN, because Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba had already %0a%3c completed his helping mission. This is why they lost the power of their donkeys, %0a%3c and could not continue using them to raise MAN and merit Higher Degrees. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, Rabbi Elazar said earlier that they did not merit seeing and %0a%3c attaining the secrets of the Supernal wisdom. The fact is that after they attained %0a%3c the level of Yechida, i.e., revealed the soul of Benayahu Ben Yehoyada with the %0a%3c help of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba, the disappearance of the screen (Masach) of BON %0a%3c caused the loss of Masach de SAG. Hence, they could no longer raise MAN. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Light stopped descending to them from Guf de Atik specifically to %0a%3c give them the opportunity, or rather the strength to recreate Masach de SAG. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 262 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Consequently, BON will become like SAG, they will resume raising MAN, and %0a%3c will once more be able to ascend from degree to degree. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, as soon as both Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Aba left their donkeys, %0a%3c they lost strength to raise MAN in order to bring BON back to the level of SAG. %0a%3c However, the voice proclaimed that they are as strong as rock and thunder, for %0a%3c so far they have endured all the trials. And they will gather strength to endure %0a%3c the mighty rocks and to overcome all the obstacles as before, until they obliterate %0a%3c these obstacles, like great hammers of thunder crashing down from Above. %0a%3c %0a%3c Bina, though herself colorless, is called "the source of colors." This is because %0a%3c she is all mercy, whereas all the other properties originate specifically from her %0a%3c by enduring all the trials, like rocks. From all this, Bina receives new forms, %0a%3c hence she received the powers of a new screen onto which emerge all the new %0a%3c degrees and Partzufim. %0a%3c %0a%3c Together with the voice that informed them of Bina 's new powers, they %0a%3c heard another voice, "The Creator's voice breaks the cedars" (Tehilim, 29:5), %0a%3c which let them know that all the cedars (obstacles) on their path to higher %0a%3c attainments have been removed. This gave them strength to climb down the %0a%3c mountain and continue their path onto Higher Degrees. %0a%3c %0a%3c 114. Upon reaching the house of Rabbi Yosi, the son of Rabbi Shimon %0a%3c Ben Yosi Ben Lakunya, they saw Rabbi Shimon BarYochai. They rejoiced. %0a%3c Rabbi Shimon rejoiced, too. He said to them, "You have traveled this path %0a%3c of Heavenly signs and wonders correctly, for as I was sleeping, I saw you and %0a%3c Benayahu Ben Yehoyada, who was sending you two crowns with an old man, %0a%3c so as to adorn you. I am certain that the Creator was on this path too, because %0a%3c I see how your faces have changed." Rabbi Yosi said, "Truly, it is said that a %0a%3c sage is preferred to a prophet." Rabbi Elazar came and put his head on the %0a%3c knees of his father, Rabbi Shimon, and told him of what had happened. %0a%3c %0a%3c Here The Zohar gives an allegorical explanation of two states: first, they merited %0a%3c attaining the Light of SAG (called Rabbi Yosi) once more, and secondly, now %0a%3c SAG and AB join in a constant Zivug. We see this from their meeting with Rabbi %0a%3c Shimon, who signifies Ohr Hochma. In other words, they merited their BON %0a%3c returning and becoming like SAG in its constant and eternal Zivug with AB. %0a%3c %0a%3c Benayahu Ben Yehoyada sent them two crowns through Rabbi Hamnuna- %0a%3c Saba: Ohr Yechida, called Benayahu Ben Yehoyada himself, and a new Light AB- %0a%3c SAG, which they have just attained. This Light also came to them by the powers %0a%3c of Benayahu Ben Yehoyada as a reward for overcoming all the trials, thanks to %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Donkey Driver %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 263 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c which they, of all others, merited this degree, which is emanated from the great %0a%3c Light of his soul. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, it follows that he sent them two crowns. However, all these descents %0a%3c on their spiritual path were not failures; rather, the Creator Himself was %0a%3c leading them to that High Degree, which they have now attained. This is why %0a%3c it is written: I AM CERTAIN THAT THE CREATOR WAS ON THIS PATH %0a%3c (with you). However, HOW YOUR FACES HAVE CHANGED, for you have %0a%3c attained something else, described by the phrase, A SAGE IS PREFERRED %0a%3c TO A PROPHET. %0a%3c %0a%3c 115. Rabbi Shimon was frightened and wept. He said, "I have heard the %0a%3c Creator and I am awed." This verse was spoken by the prophet Havakuk %0a%3c (Habakkuk), when he saw his death and his resurrection by Elisha. Why was %0a%3c he named Havakuk? Because it is written that at around this time there would %0a%3c be a HOWEK-ET-a son will be embraced. For Havakuk was the son of the %0a%3c Shunamit. And there were two embraces: one from the mother and one from %0a%3c Elisha, as it is written, "He put his mouth to his." %0a%3c %0a%3c First, it is unclear how the prophet Elisha could pass a seed in his blessing %0a%3c to the Shunamit, for this seed cannot exist (procreate). Indeed, Elisha was the %0a%3c greatest prophet after Moshe and his soul came from the Supernal Garden of %0a%3c Eden. Hence, his BON (in Hebrew, the words Ben— son and BON are spelled the %0a%3c same way: Bet-Nun) was already absolutely pure and perfect. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, when he passed his son to her, he tied him to the male side, %0a%3c whereas he tied Havakuk only to the female side. And since the female side, %0a%3c Nukva, is closer to the impure force, it clung itself to him, and he died. Thus, %0a%3c the reason for his death lies in the exalted level of the prophet, for his BON is %0a%3c pure and free from the clinging of impure forces. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, the prophet prayed: "The Creator has hidden it from me and had not %0a%3c told me!" (Melachim II, 4:27). In other words, he had not the slightest clue that he %0a%3c could die by being connected only to BON. That is why it was necessary to return, %0a%3c revive, and attach him to the Upper World, to the resurrection of the dead. %0a%3c %0a%3c The essence of the embryo is the white (Ohr Hochma) in it, as it is written %0a%3c (Talmud, Nidah, 31:1) that Aha (father) is Hochma, for Hochma is called %0a%3c "white," as it is said, "He made everything with Hochma (wisdom)" (Tehilim, %0a%3c 104). However, there is also a need for clothing in Ohr Hassadim, the intention %0a%3c "for the Creator's sake," as it is impossible to receive Ohr Hochma, the Light %0a%3c of Wisdom, attainment and delight, without the clothing of Ohr Hassadim, %0a%3c without an altruistic intention. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 264 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c So the mother must provide the red, the screen, which provides Ohr %0a%3c Hassadim, required for the clothing of Ohr Hochma in it. As a result of the Ohr %0a%3c Hassadim embracing (clothing, enveloping) Ohr Hochma in itself, an embryo can %0a%3c exist. And here the embryo's entire embrace came only from the mother, the %0a%3c Shunamit, i.e., only from the female side (BON). %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, when Elisha revived him, he gave him the white (Hochma) and the %0a%3c red (Hassadim) once more. It follows that it was Elisha himself who embraced %0a%3c him the second time. It is hence said that there were two Havakuks (from the %0a%3c word Hihuk— embrace): one from the mother and the other from Elisha. %0a%3c %0a%3c 116. 1 have discovered in the book of King Solomon that the name Havakuk %0a%3c consists of seventy-two names. Elisha created it with words. Each word consists %0a%3c of three letters, for the letters of the alphabet that the Father confirmed to him %0a%3c initially flew away when he died. But Elisha embraced him and confirmed in %0a%3c him all these letters in his seventy-two names. In all, there are 216 letters in his %0a%3c seventy-two names, three letters in each. %0a%3c %0a%3c The embryo is built of 216 = RYU (Reish = 200 + Yod =10 + Vav = 6) letters, %0a%3c designating Ohr Hochma, which descends to YESHSUT. This means that the %0a%3c embryo has RYU letters, which amounts to the Gematria of RE'IYAH = Reish- %0a%3c Aleph-Yod'Hey, i.e., the Light of vision. Re'iyah means vision in Hebrew, and %0a%3c vision is possible only in Ohr Hochma, for "seeing" means "attaining," and the %0a%3c Light of the eyes is the Light of Hochma. %0a%3c %0a%3c When a growing Partzuf attains Gadlut, receives the clothing of Ohr Hassadim %0a%3c of the Upper World from AVI, and RYU clothe in Ohr Hassadim, this Partzuf is %0a%3c called AB (72) names, as each three letters join into one and RYU = 216 letters %0a%3c turn into AB = seventy-two groups with three letters in each group, or AB = %0a%3c seventy-two names. %0a%3c %0a%3c When Ohr Hassadim, the clothing of the Partzuf, comes only from the lower %0a%3c world, it is defined as RYU = 216 letters. And when it attains AB, Hassadim %0a%3c of the Upper World, each three letters form a group, and this results in AB = %0a%3c seventy-two names, as it is written, HE CONFIRMED IN HIM ALL THESE %0a%3c LETTERS. When Elisha revived Havakuk, the son of the Shunamit, he created %0a%3c the name Havakuk, AB = seventy-two letters from RYU = 216, for he gave him %0a%3c Ohr Hassadim of the Upper World from AB. %0a%3c %0a%3c Because of it, all 216 letters made groups of three and formed three lines %0a%3c from Above downwards: right, left and middle. A cell made of three letters— the %0a%3c right, left, and middle lines, situated horizontally (referring to the same screen %0a%3c and type of Kli)— is regarded as one. Therefore, AB (seventy-two) letters is used %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Donkey Driver %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 265 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c instead of AB (seventy-two) names, because each letter is considered to include %0a%3c three, merged into one. When Ohr Hochma enters these seventy-two cells, the %0a%3c Partzuf is called AB and is said to have the complete Light of Hochma. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c One cell. In all, there are 72 %0a%3c such 3-letter cells (names) %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Ohr Hassadim is the Light that brings peace in the state of the Partzuf at a %0a%3c given moment, for its property is not to wish anything for itself, but to bestow. %0a%3c However, Ohr Hassadim received from the lower world is merely comfort "for %0a%3c want of something better," whereas Ohr Hassadim received from the Upper World %0a%3c creates such a powerful property of "bestowal" that the Partzuf receives Ohr Hochma, %0a%3c thereby showing that although it has Ohr Hochma, it still prefers Ohr Hassadim. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is similar to a person in our world, who says that he needs nothing. Yet, %0a%3c there is a distinction: does he say this in a state when he has nothing and can %0a%3c have everything he wants, but still wishes to restrict himself to bare essentials %0a%3c and to give away the rest? %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, when the growing Partzuf (the son— BON) had only Ohr Hassadim %0a%3c from the lower world, it could not receive Ohr Hochma in it, and was thus called %0a%3c RYU letters. But since the impure forces still cling to them and tempt the Partzuf %0a%3c to receive Ohr Hochma for itself, Ohr Hochma cannot be clothed within them. %0a%3c %0a%3c These RYU letters that Havakuk had since the day of his birth FLEW AWAY %0a%3c WHEN HE DIED. Hence, it was essential to give him RYU letters and AB %0a%3c names once more. And Elisha did just that by HIS SPIRIT, for he was obliged %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 266 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c to recreate in him RYU letters in order to combine them into AB cells with %0a%3c the help of the Upper Hassadim (combine everything into three lines), when %0a%3c everything unites into AB names. %0a%3c %0a%3c 117. Elisha confirmed all of these letters in the soul of Havakuk so as to revive %0a%3c him by the letters of the seventy-two names. And he called him Havakuk, for that %0a%3c is his complete name, which describes all of his properties, as it alludes to two %0a%3c Havakuks and to the 216 letters of the Holy Name, as the Qematria (numerical %0a%3c value) of the name Havakuk is 216, from which the seventy-two names were %0a%3c formed. By AB names he revived him and brought his spirit back, and by RYU %0a%3c letters he revived his body and let it live. This is why he is called Havakuk. %0a%3c %0a%3c Havakuk = Chet + Bet + Kuf + Vav + Kuf = 8 + 2 + 100 + 6 + 100 = 216. %0a%3c The word Havakuk indicates two embraces (Hibukim, plural for Hibuk). Like %0a%3c all Hebrew names, it refers to the property of its bearer. For instance, Yaakov %0a%3c is derived from "Akev" ("got around" Esav), and Avraham signifies Av —father, %0a%3c Am— of the nation). %0a%3c %0a%3c The first embrace came from Ima, but it did not yet allow Ohr Hochma into %0a%3c the Partzuf, into RYU letters, for the impure force clings to the red in Ima. But %0a%3c then Elisha embraced him with Hassadim of the Upper World that came from %0a%3c AVI. This united the letters into groups (names), and Ohr Hochma entered and %0a%3c filled these names permanently, since the impure force cannot cling to Hassadim %0a%3c of the Upper World. %0a%3c %0a%3c As in the above example, even if all the Ohr Hochma were to be offered, the %0a%3c Partzuf, upon receiving protection in the form of a desire for Hassadim of the %0a%3c Upper World, receives such great strength (desire) to bestow that it never wants %0a%3c Hochma. This is precisely why Hochma can fill it for all eternity. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, the name Havakuk denotes two Chihukim (embraces): one from %0a%3c the mother and one from Elisha, thereby imparting him with perfection from all %0a%3c sides: from both the Ohr Hochma and the Ohr Hassadim. "Embraces" signify Ohr %0a%3c Hassadim that stems from AVI, and Ohr Hochma received within Ohr Hassadim %0a%3c is called "the secrets of RYU." %0a%3c %0a%3c It is hence written that HE REVIVED HIS SPIRIT BY AB NAMES AND %0a%3c HIS BODY BY RYU LETTERS. And he was revived by Elisha's embrace, for %0a%3c RYU letters had formed names, that is, the three lines, in which Ohr Hochma %0a%3c could be received, thanks to the reception of Ohr Hassadim from AVI (the %0a%3c Upper World). %0a%3c %0a%3c The impure forces (man's egoistic desires) cannot attack in this Light. %0a%3c Hence, death (the result of receiving Ohr Hochma for oneself) does not exist. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Donkey Driver %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 267 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Subsequently, he receives Ohr Hochma, which yields the complete correction %0a%3c of his Guf. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, the Partzuf '(son of the Shunamit) had RYU letters from the moment %0a%3c of birth, and they left him when he died. Then why is he called Havakuk (two %0a%3c embraces)? After all, the first embrace of Ima (mother) left him the moment %0a%3c of his death, and Elisha revived him from death by embracing him only once. %0a%3c Thus, does he not contain only the embrace of Elisha? %0a%3c %0a%3c The thing is that Elisha has given him nothing new at the time of resurrection, %0a%3c except for the embrace, the Light from the Supernal Ima— SAG, whose Light %0a%3c evokes the resurrection of the dead. And RYU letters were simply revived by his %0a%3c lower mother— BON. These are the same RYU of BON with which he was born. %0a%3c Otherwise, it would have been an entirely new soul, of which one would not %0a%3c have been able to say that it was dead and then resurrected. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, now he truly has two embraces, for the first one has now been %0a%3c revived as well, when BON ascended to SAG. And since BON is in the place of %0a%3c SAG, his Hassadim are regarded as those of the Supernal Mother. They completely %0a%3c neutralize the impure forces and death, for their properties (desires) are only of %0a%3c bestowal, which the impure force cannot bear. Thus, they can no longer tempt %0a%3c man. This is why he is called Havakuk, after the action of the two embraces. %0a%3c %0a%3c 118. He said, "I have heard the Creator and I am awed by His Name." I %0a%3c have heard of what I had and have had a taste of the other world at the %0a%3c moment of death, before Elisha resurrected him, and I am awed. He began %0a%3c asking for mercy for his soul. He said, "O, Creator, the deeds that You %0a%3c have performed for me throughout the years were my life." And whoever %0a%3c connects to the past years (the name of the Sefirot of Atik), connects to life. %0a%3c Throughout the years, bestow life upon the degree that has no life of its %0a%3c own, upon Malchut de Malchut. %0a%3c %0a%3c His fear comes from the past, previous states, for now he has become perfect %0a%3c on all his sides, and therefore fear has no place. This fear remained from the past, %0a%3c when he left the world. This describes the state between death and resurrection. %0a%3c However, he continues receiving fear from the past state, so it would help him %0a%3c create a screen for raising MAN. It is precisely this fear from past times (states) %0a%3c that stimulates him to raise MAN (request for mercy). %0a%3c %0a%3c This is the secret of the future screen, after BON becomes SAG. For then %0a%3c "He will eradicate death forever" (Yeshayahu, 25:8), and there will be no force %0a%3c evoking fear of death and suffering or able to cause harm to one's purity and %0a%3c holiness. Hence, there will be no need to shun, no one to beware of or avoid. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 268 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c So if one has attained such an exalted spiritual state, where could he possibly %0a%3c acquire fear? After all, he will not be able to ascend without it! Only if he takes %0a%3c fear from his past states! For the Partzuf retains the memories, records, recollec- %0a%3c tions of past states, even after its ascent to SAG, when BON become like SAG. %0a%3c %0a%3c If not for the recollections of fear from the past states, the Partzuf would %0a%3c not have been able to create a screen in a state when it has nothing left to fear. %0a%3c While explaining this, Rabbi Shimon told them of Havakuk, to teach them how %0a%3c to acquire fear, just as Havakuk did by taking fear from the past. %0a%3c %0a%3c THE DEEDS THAT YOU HAVE PERFORMED... THROUGHOUT %0a%3c THE YEARS... WERE MY LIFE-because he lived through two periods: the %0a%3c years preceding his death and the years following his resurrection. Between %0a%3c these two periods, there was a state of exiting this world, death (during which %0a%3c he existed in the other world). That is to say, because I remember the time of %0a%3c my death, I thereby connect to life of the Upper World, which Elisha bestowed %0a%3c by resurrecting me. %0a%3c %0a%3c ZATde Atik is called the "past (sometimes ancient) years," since they receive %0a%3c their Light from Malchut of the world of AK, Malchut of Tzimtzum Aleph. %0a%3c However, ZAT de Atik do not shine upon the lower Partzufim and worlds with %0a%3c their Light of Tzimtzum Aleph. ZAT de Atik shine downward during the 6,000 %0a%3c years with diminished Light, restricting it according to the laws of Tzimtzum Bet. %0a%3c Only at the end of correction will they begin to pass down all of their Light. It is %0a%3c written in the Torah that the Light that Atik had passed during the 6,000 years %0a%3c is designated with the small letter Hey in the word Avraham. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, because Havakuk's death has purified him completely, since at the %0a%3c end of correction he merited merging with the "past years" of Atik, he received %0a%3c the required strength in Elisha's embraces and resurrection. It is hence written %0a%3c that after he has purified himself and felt fear at the moment of his death, the %0a%3c power of this fear enabled him to establish contact with ZAT de Atik and receive %0a%3c the Light called "eternal life." %0a%3c %0a%3c For having purified himself through death, BON received complete %0a%3c correction, upon ascending and becoming SAG at the time of death. Subsequently, %0a%3c it reaches the degree of Malchut de Malchut, a Zivug on which can only be made %0a%3c at the end of correction, and attains this degree, the Light of his life. %0a%3c %0a%3c 119. Rabbi Shimon wept and said: "And I have seen from the Creator what %0a%3c I have heard." He raised his hands above his head, and said: "But you have %0a%3c merited seeing Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba, the Light of the Torah, face to face, %0a%3c while I have not." He fell on his face and saw him who uproots mountains and %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Donkey Driver %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 269 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c lights candles in the Temple of the King (Mashiach). He said to him, "Rabbi, %0a%3c in the other world we shall be neighbors with the heads of the assemblies %0a%3c before the Creator." From here on, he called his son Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi %0a%3c Aba by the name Pnei'el (the face of God), as it is written: "For I have seen %0a%3c the Creator face to face." %0a%3c %0a%3c He praised himself for using the same fear from the past, just like Proph- %0a%3c et Havakuk. %0a%3c %0a%3c All corrections are already ready and waiting in the hall of the King %0a%3c (Mashiach), down to the very last detail. They must all be revealed at the end of %0a%3c all corrections, with the appearance of the King. And the souls in that hall are %0a%3c those who merited completion of their individual corrections, for there is an %0a%3c individual correction and a general one. %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut de Malchut is the only creation, and it is divided into parts called %0a%3c souls. These parts merge with people of our world, and each of them, while %0a%3c existing within man, must attain one's own correction, i.e., gradually replace %0a%3c one's properties (desires) with those of the Creator. This is considered the soul's %0a%3c individual or personal correction. So then, the souls that have attained their %0a%3c individual correction reach and exist in the state called "abiding in the hall of %0a%3c the King-Mashiach." %0a%3c %0a%3c The Light in that hall (the Light of the Torah), also called Hamnuna-Saba, %0a%3c completely liberates man from the impure forces, i.e., purifies him from all his %0a%3c primordial egoistic desires and corrects Malchut de Malchut, which "appears to %0a%3c the righteous as a high mountain" (Talmud, Sota, 52). This correction is made %0a%3c by creating a new SAG-like screen with the purpose of raising MAN (the request %0a%3c for final correction). MAN is called Me'orei Esh (sparkles of fire), as it is written: %0a%3c "Man's soul is the Creator's candle" (Mishley, 20:27). %0a%3c %0a%3c The light of the sun designates the Light's descent, MAD, just as sunlight %0a%3c descends upon us from Above, whereas a fire's flame signifies Ohr Hozer %0a%3c that rises from below upwards, like candlelight. The Zohar therefore says that %0a%3c these two corrections, aimed at destroying the impure forces and ascending to %0a%3c light the candles in the hall of the King-Mashiach, are in the hands of Rabbi %0a%3c Hamnuna-Saba. %0a%3c %0a%3c And the perfect righteous in need of these two final corrections merit %0a%3c receiving them only through revealing the soul of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba. And %0a%3c he stated that they (the disciples of Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Aba) will merit the %0a%3c honor of serving in the hall of the King-Mashiach after their death, and will %0a%3c become his neighbors and the heads of the Creator's Assembly. %0a\ No newline at end of file%0a
