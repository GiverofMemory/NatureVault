Petko has made PmWiki into his own personal fork that serves himself not the community.%0a%0a#PmWiki software scrapes and records all editors browser fingerprint and IP addresses onto the webserver and makes it impossible to turn this tracking off without editing the source code (which I did).%0a%0a#Petko doesn't care about breaking cookbooks that he doesn't use (just to make inconsequential and unnecessary updates for features no one wants nor asked for), and seems to actually have disdain for Vector skin (wikipedia lookalike that I use).  His updates in recent years have totally broke the skin - from pmwiki's built in TOC not working, to titledictindex not displaying correctly, to sectionedit not working.%0a%0a#Things I do care about like fixing search, making certain single words always linked, or making external links into a references section at the bottom of pages, he doesn't care about.%0a%0a#Petko censors comments in pmwiki.org talk pages that cast a negative light on things.%0a%0a!!Fork ideas%0a%0aI have a vision of everyone hosting thier own personal Vault but thier site also has Vaults of 'everyone' (or everyone who they want) Vaults as well.  Sort of like how this site hosts it's own instance of NatureVault, Crypto Projects, and PmWiki.  Using Github to keep your instance updated with everyone elses Vault's may use github or something like that, or even a blockchain like [[Crypto Projects/Blockvault]].  Kind of like Ward Cunningham's "wiki federation" idea [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki#Alternative_definitions|#]]%0a%0aMypedia%0a%0aOurpedia%0a%0aOurnotes%0a%0aSharenotes%0a%0aSwapnotes%0a%0aPublicnotes%0a%0aMynotepad%0a%0aVmwiki (vault management wiki)%0a%0aPubnote%0a%0aVaults%0a%0aHiveMind%0a%0aThinkDifferent%0a%0aGroupThink%0a%0aThinkTank%0a%0aMentalMob%0a%0aMindUpload%0a%0aMyMind%0a%0a!!!Future of wiki%0a%0aNot sure if the 'wiki' name can/should stick.  Wikipedia gives a lot of (some positive some negative) connotation.%0a%0aCollaborative note taking, team collaboration, project management [[https://alternativeto.net/software/pmwiki/?feature=note-taking|#]]%0a%0aFor mainstream adoption must have wysiwyg, vector skin has some but probably not enough.%0a%0aNeed to lean in to a desired userbase while keeping all the flexibility (or most, whatever makes sense) of a full fledged wiki.  Could be personal/collaborative note taking, collaborative knowledge base, etc.  Drop the wiki term which is scary to people and focus on a market.%0a%0aPersonal knowledge base with option to upload to others, need common syntax [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4656298/which-wiki-text-syntax-or-markdown-to-use|#]]%0a%0aShould be interconnectable [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki#Editing|#]] which means common syntax.  Creole isn't bad, but I think some improvements need to be made.%0a%0aOne of the worst problems with pmwiki and languages in general is different characters mixed in the tags like [@[+ big +]@] not only does it take longer to write, but it's not memorable and the order of the two types of characters is reversed for the opening and the closing, so you can't just copy and paste the same thing for opening and closing tags.  Creole does fix this by making the vast majority just repeating the same characters for a certain function [[http://wikicreole.org/wiki/Creole1.0|#]] it does seem that "big" tags and similar aren't in creole though... Also it looks like any hope for creole 2.0 are dead, and the project seems dead and in "less than maintenance" mode.  Lots of good ideas there though.%0a%0a!!!The conundrum of PmWiki%0a%0asee my post on this at [[https://www.pmwiki.org/wiki/PmWiki/PmWikiPhilosophy-Talk|#]] on 10/27/2022.%0a%0a[[PmWiki/PmWiki]] seems to be founded on a faulty premise, that of making core as simple as possible and relying on cookbooks, especially user created and maintained cookbooks to provide additional functionality.  The fact is that as this mountain of user generated content has grown, they inevitably have not been kept up to date with core upgrades and have thus been broken along the way.  Petko has kept his pet cookbooks compatible with current PmWiki, but those he has not maintained have been broken by his core upgrades.  The way forward I feel is to never make breaking changes (that includes php updates or moving functions to different files) in a core version ie: 2.'''''2'''''.xxx.  This way we know for sure that a cookbook made for a certain version will reliably work with any revision in that version, and that if you want to use that cookbook you have to use a revision within that version. --[[~NatureHacker]] 2022 Oct27 20:52 UTC%0a%0a!!Updates%0a%0asee also [[code]]%0a%0aMake sure not to overwrite [[Site.PageListTemplates]] or [[Category.GroupFooter]] also be mindful to forward updates from Pmwiki.php that remove spyware.%0a%0aKeep offlineconfig.php up to date with config.php%0a%0aComparison of web development languages [[https://hackr.io/blog/top-php-alternatives|#]] considering broad applicability, [[python]] is probably best.%0a%0a!!![[PHP]]%0a%0aPHP will cause the collapse of the internet, bar none.  The development moves with reckless abandon leaving a wake of destroyed websites.  Nearly all websites (including PmWiki) run primarily on PHP.  Its almost as if they are trying to destroy the internet.  The internet is a bubble inflated with PHP hot air, sooner or later it will pop.%0a%0aUpgrading 7.4 to 8.0 [[https://www.php.net/manual/en/migration80.php|#]]%0a%0aEven between 8.0 to 8.1 there are lots of backwards incompatible changes [[https://www.php.net/manual/en/migration81.php|#]] and 5.4 to 5.6 [[https://support.rebel.com/hc/en-us/articles/360047782954-How-do-I-fix-a-WordPress-website-broken-by-a-PHP-upgrade-Classic-Hosting|#]]%0a%0aIt's hard to tell from this but //active// support ends only 1 year after //stable// release [[https://www.php.net/supported-versions.php|#]]%0a%0aAssisted code version upgrading by rector [[https://github.com/rectorphp/rector|#]]%0a%0a!!![[Python]]%0a%0aPython isn't used in pmwiki but it is used in other wiki alternatives%0a%0aPython backwards compatibility is better and never changes from a revision [[https://discuss.python.org/t/backward-compatibility-of-python-versions/14879/2|#]].  I consider it (majorversion.minorversion.revision) some call it (majorversion.minorversion.microversion) where micro/revision are only bug fixes never new syntax or deprications.%0a%0a!!![[Perl]]%0a%0aPerl has a strong commitment to backwards compatibility and has been on the same major version since 1994 [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1855493/what-are-some-specific-examples-of-backward-incompatibilities-in-perl-versions|#]].

diff:1666903972:1666897836:=81,84d80%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!The conundrum of PmWiki%0a%3c %0a%3c [[PmWiki/PmWiki]] seems to be founded on a faulty premise, that of making core as simple as possible and relying on cookbooks, especially user created and maintained cookbooks to provide additional functionality.  The fact is that as this mountain of user generated content has grown, they inevitably have not been kept up to date with core upgrades and have thus been broken along the way.  Petko has kept his pet cookbooks compatible with current PmWiki, but those he has not maintained have been broken by his core upgrades.  The way forward I feel si to never make breaking changes (that includes php updates or moving functions to different files) in a core version ie: 2.'''''2'''''.xxx.  This way we know for sure that a cookbook made for a certain version will reliably work with any revision in that version, and that if you want to use that cookbook you have to use a revision within that version. --[[~NatureHacker]] 2022 Oct27 20:52 UTC%0a
