Petko has made PmWiki into his own personal fork that serves himself not the community.%0a%0a#PmWiki software scrapes and records all editors browser fingerprint and IP addresses onto the webserver and makes it impossible to turn this tracking off without editing the source code (which I did).%0a%0a#Petko doesn't care about breaking cookbooks that he doesn't use (just to make inconsequential and unnecessary updates for features no one wants nor asked for), and seems to actually have disdain for Vector skin (wikipedia lookalike that I use).  His updates in recent years have totally broke the skin - from pmwiki's built in TOC not working, to titledictindex not displaying correctly, to sectionedit not working.%0a%0a#Things I do care about like fixing search, making certain single words always linked, or making external links into a references section at the bottom of pages, he doesn't care about.%0a%0a#Petko censors comments in pmwiki.org talk pages that cast a negative light on things.%0a%0a!!Fork ideas%0a%0aI have a vision of everyone hosting thier own personal Vault but thier site also has Vaults of 'everyone' (or everyone who they want) Vaults as well.  Sort of like how this site hosts it's own instance of NatureVault, Crypto Projects, and PmWiki.  Using Github to keep your instance updated with everyone elses Vault's may use github or something like that, or even a blockchain like [[Crypto Projects/Blockvault]].  Kind of like Ward Cunningham's "wiki federation" idea [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki#Alternative_definitions|#]]%0a%0aMypedia%0a%0aOurpedia%0a%0aOurnotes%0a%0aSharenotes%0a%0aSwapnotes%0a%0aPublicnotes%0a%0aMynotepad%0a%0aVmwiki (vault management wiki)%0a%0aPubnote%0a%0aVaults%0a%0aHiveMind%0a%0aThinkDifferent%0a%0aGroupThink%0a%0aThinkTank%0a%0aMentalMob%0a%0aMindUpload%0a%0aMyMind%0a%0a!!!Future of wiki%0a%0aNot sure if the 'wiki' name can/should stick.  Wikipedia gives a lot of (some positive some negative) connotation.%0a%0aCollaborative note taking, team collaboration, project management [[https://alternativeto.net/software/pmwiki/?feature=note-taking|#]]%0a%0aFor mainstream adoption must have wysiwyg, vector skin has some but probably not enough.%0a%0aNeed to lean in to a desired userbase while keeping all the flexibility (or most, whatever makes sense) of a full fledged wiki.  Could be personal/collaborative note taking, collaborative knowledge base, etc.  Drop the wiki term which is scary to people and focus on a market.%0a%0aPersonal knowledge base with option to upload to others, need common syntax [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4656298/which-wiki-text-syntax-or-markdown-to-use|#]]%0a%0aShould be interconnectable [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki#Editing|#]] which means common syntax.  Creole isn't bad, but I think some improvements need to be made.%0a%0aOne of the worst problems with pmwiki and languages in general is different characters mixed in the tags like @@[+ big +]@@ not only does it take longer to write, but it's not memorable and the order of the two types of characters is reversed for the opening and the closing, so you can't just copy and paste the same thing for opening and closing tags.  Creole does fix this by making the vast majority just repeating the same characters for a certain function [[http://wikicreole.org/wiki/Creole1.0|#]] it does seem that "big" tags and similar aren't in creole though... Also it looks like any hope for creole 2.0 are dead, and the project seems dead and in "less than maintenance" mode.  Lots of good ideas there though.%0a%0a!!Cookbooks%0a%0a!!!SectionEdit%0a%0a[[https://www.pmwiki.org/wiki/Cookbook/SectionEdit|#]]%0a%0a!!!!Troubleshooting%0a%0aWow it fixed itself after reverting to old version and also after making this page.  Wuen I made it, it strangely went to pmwiki/pmwiki so I made naturevault/pmwiki and as soon as I created that sectionedit worked again!  Must have reset something. Its possible I was just never logged in so didn't see it after reverting.%0a%0a!!!Dictindex%0a%0a!!!!Troubleshooting%0a%0aCurrently the anchor arrows on each letter are not showing up in vector skin (are other skins working?) may need to downgrade pmwiki installation to 2.102 I believe which might have been the last update for vector [[https://github.com/GiverofMemory/NatureVault/blob/9d287a7ec19789600074186cb56b03428d8870e7/wiki/pub/skins/vector/Place%2520contents%2520in%2520wiki.d/Category.Category#L1|#]].
