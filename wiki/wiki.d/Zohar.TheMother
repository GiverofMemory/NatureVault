text=The Mother Lends Her Clothes %0ato Her Daughter %0a%0a%0a%0a16. Heaven, Earth, and all that inhabit them were created by MA, which is %0aMalchut, as it is said: "When I behold your Heavens, the work of your hands" %0a(Tehilim, 8:4). And before this, it is said, "MA - WHAT (How) majestic Your %0aname is throughout the earth, which You established above the Heavens" %0a(Tehilim, 8:2). After all, the Heavens were created by the name (property) %0aMA (Malchut). It is written "in the Heavens," which refers to Bina, called %0aMI, the Heavens that are above ZA. The explanation for this lies in the name %0aElokim. MA (Malchut) ascends and enters with her properties into Bina, %0ai.e., connects into Bina, and receives her properties. Bina is called Elokim. %0aAfter He CREATED LIGHT FOR LIGHT, meaning Ohr (Light) Hassadim %0a(called "precious adornments or garments") so as to clothe Ohr Hochma, %0aOhr Hassadim clothes Ohr Hochma, which signifies the creation of Light for %0aLight; by the force of the Supernal Name Elokim (Bina), Malchut ascends, %0aand, upon joining Bina, receives all of her properties, and includes herself in %0aBina. Therefore, BERESHEET BARAH ELOKIM (In the beginning the %0aCreator created) refers to the Supernal Elokim, to Bina and not to Malchut. %0aFor MA (Malchut) is not created by the name MI ELEH. %0a%0aThe lower world (Malchut, MA) receives the Light (marked from Above %0aby the name Elokim) from Bina. This Light brings Malchut strength, and the %0aproperties suitable for the creation of Heaven, earth, and posterity manifest %0awithin her. After all, there cannot be any posterity or birth of new generations %0awithout the Light of Haya. %0a%0aAnd this is what The Zohar tells us: so does the lower world (Malchut, MA) %0aexist by the name Elokim, by the name from the Upper World, which is why %0a%0a101 %0a%0a%0a%0a102 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0athere's strength in Malchut (Ohr Hochma) to create generations. And if Malchut %0ahas Ohr Hochma, then the world can be created by her. %0a%0a(Haya is one type of Ohr Hochma. There is one Light that the Creator %0aemanates, or rather, the sensation of the Creator we refer to as Light. This %0asensation depends on the desires-Kelim in which we feel Him. And since there %0aare only two types of desires-Kelim, those of "bestowal" and those of "reception," %0athere exist only two types of Light, Hassadim and Hochma. However, each of %0athem includes several subtypes, and Ohr Haya constitutes a particular form of %0aOhr Hochma. This is because Hochma is the Light or pleasure that is felt by the %0awill "to receive," whereas Hassadim is the pleasure that is felt by the will "to %0abestow." If only the Kelim of bestowal (GE) are present in the Partzuf, it is filled %0awith Ohr Hassadim; and if it has the strength to receive for the Creator's sake, it %0ais filled with Ohr Hochma.) (Do not confuse this with MA, which is used here, %0awhere MA = Malchut with ZA = MA in Gematria). %0a%0aThe Zohar explains that the Light descends from the name Elokim thanks %0ato the merging of MI and ELEH. ZA is called "Heaven." YESHSUT is above %0aHeaven (ZA). There is no MI in Heaven (ZA), only MA. However, after Ohr %0aHassadim clothes Ohr Hochma (the Light ELEH = AHP clothes the Light of MA %0a= GE), all the letters combine and ascend by the name Elokim above Heaven = %0aZA = MA to YESHSUT = Bina = MI. %0a%0aMI (Bina) is above the second restriction, above its ban, as her properties %0aare higher, better than those to which the restriction extends: the property %0aof Bina is "not to receive anything," which is why the ban of the second %0arestriction— to not receive— simply does not apply to her, for in her essence, %0ashe has no desire to receive. %0a%0aThere remains only the ban of T^imt^um Alef>h, the restriction imposed on %0athe reception of Light in Malchut herself (Malchut de Malchut), the central point %0aof all creation, the only creating being. Malchut herself is egoistic, but if she has %0aa Masach and only receives the Light by means of a Zivug de Hakaa (resistance %0ato one's own desire, only for the Creator's sake) on the desires of bestowal, such %0areception does not occur in Malchut, but rather in the first nine Sefirot. Hence, %0aMalchut can receive the Light in her first nine Sefirot. %0a%0aIn other words, if Malchut has the will (strength) to receive (enjoy) the Light %0a(pleasure) not for herself, but only because the Creator so desires, then she %0areceives only this amount of Light (pleasure). In order to receive the Light under %0asuch a condition, Malchut (man's inclination to pleasure and enjoyment) must %0afirst reject all incoming pleasure, which Malchut perceives to be right there before %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Mother Lends Her Clothes to Her Daughter %0a%0a%0a%0a103 %0a%0a%0a%0aher. This is referred to as the Light's (the pleasure's) impact against the screen %0aand its reflection off the screen (the reflection of pleasure by force of will so as %0ato not receive, in spite of the natural, primordial desire to receive pleasure). %0a%0aThe reflected pleasure is called Ohr Hassadim. Essentially, this is not a Light, %0abut rather Malchut's intention to receive only for the Creator's sake. However, %0athis intention is that necessary and sufficient condition for the subsequent %0areception of Ohr Hochma from the Creator. For after Malchut repelled all the %0aLight (expressed her intention to not receive for her own sake), she thereby %0amet the condition of Tzimtzum Aleph (first restriction) to only receive the Light %0aof Hochma in the intention for the Creator's sake, which is called Ohr Hozer %0a(Returning Light) or Ohr Hassadim. And now she can receive Ohr Hochma, the %0apleasure that the Creator wants to bestow upon her. %0a%0aHowever, by receiving this Light, Malchut is no more a mere recipient- %0acreature. Now, like the Creator, she bestows pleasure upon Him! In this %0amanner, the creature attains the degree of the Creator, becomes equal to Him %0ain properties, for it wants to bestow everything. This is called "being filled with %0aOhr Hassadim." Moreover, Malchut receives and enjoys, for if she does not feel %0apleasure, she will not please the Creator. %0a%0aTherefore, Malchut receives, meaning she is filled with Ohr Hochma, full of %0awisdom and pleasure, from both bestowal and reception for the Creator's sake. %0aAnd herein lies the perfection of the Creator's Creation: she becomes perfect %0aand similar to the Creator. And this is the perfection of the Creator's works: His %0acreation can ascend to His level independently! %0a%0aOne can imagine one's path from the lows of our world up to the ultimate %0aspiritual peak— the Creator— as a passage through a suite of rooms. In all, %0abetween our state and the Creator there are 125 connected, walkthrough %0arooms. Each room has its own properties, and only those who possess the same %0aproperties can be there. If, regardless of reason, man changes his properties, %0ahe is automatically moved as though by an invisible current to a room that %0acorresponds to his new properties. %0a%0aThis is how one can move between these rooms: an infinitesimal inner %0achange of properties evokes influence of a spiritual force-field upon man, %0aimmediately moves to his new place of equilibrium, where his inne %0acompletely coincide with the external properties of the spiri %0ace, there are no guards at the rooms' entrances/ exits; as soon as %0aes himself so as to match the properties of the next, higher room, he is %0a%0a%0a%0a104 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0apleasure %0a%0a%0a%0a%0as the %0aLse %0a%0a%0a%0aWhat properties must one change in order to move from one rc %0aanother within this spiritual field? He only needs to alter the type of pie %0ato which he aspires. We cannot help receiving pleasure, for such is the entire %0amaterial of creation, it is all that was created. However, we can change the object %0aof our aspirations, what it is that we wish to enjoy: either coarse reception, %0areception of mere necessities, or the Creator being pleased with us that we %0abestow to Him, that we receive because such is His wish. %0a%0aOur "I," the entity that feels pleasure is present in all of our desires, which %0aange ceaselessly in terms of both magnitude and the desired object. %0avex disappears. The only thing of which one should rid himself is %0asensation that he does something to please this "I." One should aspire to sense %0athe desires of the Creator, how He is pleased with him (just as a mother %0apleased with her son's achievements). %0a%0aAfter Malchut decides to receive only for the Creator's sake, i.e., according %0ato the force of her Masach (the force of resistance to her egoistic will to receive %0apleasure), she receives Ohr Hochma only in accordance with the magnitude of %0athe Returning Light. Or, conversely, one may say that the magnitude of the %0aReturning Light determines man's willpower and his desire to act for the %0aCreator's sake. %0a%0aHowever, the first nine of Malchut's ten Sefirot are not egoistic, as they are %0athe Creator's properties with which He wishes to correct Malchut. Only the last %0aSefira of Malchut, Malchut herself, the single creation, called Malchut de Malchut, %0ais egoistic and remains under the ban of the first restriction: Ohr Hochma does %0anot enter where the will to receive pleasure is present. Therefore, the first nine %0aSefirot can receive the Light of Hochma. %0a%0aHowever, after the second restriction, in order to correct Malchut and impart %0athe properties of mercy (Hassadim) onto her so she would be able to desire to %0a"bestow," acquire the properties of Bina, and convert her initial, primordial %0aegoism into altruism, Malchut ascended to Partzuf Aha, became Malchut in %0aPartzuf Aha in Bina 's place, while Bina found herself below Malchut. Bina herself %0acan receive Ohr Hochma without any restrictions, even when below Malchut. %0aHowever, Bina adopted the limitations of Tzimtzum Bet for the sole purpose of %0acorrecting Malchut. %0a%0aTherefore, due to the MAN raised by the lower ones, by man's requests for %0aspiritual correction, the Light AB-SAG descends and lowers Malchut from the %0alevel of Bina back to her own place: Malchut descends from Bina, and the Light %0aof attainment and wisdom is revealed. %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Mother Lends Her Clothes to Her Daughter %0a%0a%0a%0a105 %0a%0a%0a%0aAs a result of Malchut's descent, Bina purifies herself from all restrictions and %0alimitations and returns to receiving Ohr Hochma. And after the Ohr Hassadim %0aclothes the Ohr Hochma, MI shines in ELEH and the name Elokim is revealed, %0ameaning that Ohr Hochma shines. %0a%0aThe structure of the name Elokim cannot be found in MA, for the lower %0aboundary of Heaven (Malchut herself) is limited by Tzimtzum Aleph— the ban %0aimposed on the reception of Ohr Hochma, and by Tzimtzum Bet's 6,000-year long %0aprohibition on the usage of the desires of reception. Hence, The Zohar tells us %0athat the name Elokim was created with MI, and not with MA, by the property %0areceived by Malchut upon her ascent to Bina. %0a%0a17. But as the letters ELEH descend from Above, from Bina down to Malchut, %0afor the mother temporarily lends her clothes to her daughter and adorns her %0awith her own adornments, the name Elokim descends from Bina (mother) %0ato Malchut (daughter). When does she adorn her with her own adornments? %0aWhen she sees the male essence before her. It is then written of her, "Three %0atimes in the year shall all your males appear before the Lord Creator" (Shemot, %0a34:23). For Malchut is then called by the male name "Master." As it is written: %0a"Behold the Ark of the Union, the Master of all the earth" (Yehoshua, 3:11). %0aThe Torah is the Union and the Ark is Malchut, called by the male name %0a"Master." For she received the Kelim (properties, desires) called "clothes," %0aand the Light called "adornments" from her mother, Bina. The letter Hey %0a(A from MA) then leaves MA (Mem + Hey) and the letter Yod (I) enters in %0aits stead, and just like Bina, Malchut assumes the name MI. And then she %0aadorns herself with male clothes, with the clothes of Bina, to accept all the %0ahusbands of Israel. %0a%0aAs it is written (item 13), Tzimtzum Bet is in force from the Rosh of AA %0adownwards, for Malchut of AA ascended to Bina and created all the lower %0aPartzufim of the world of Atzilut in the property of Tzimtzum Bet. Thus, each %0aPartzuf of AA, AVI and ZON has only two Sefirot K-H, and three Sefirot B-ZA-M %0aseparated themselves (their properties) from that degree, and moved to a lower %0aone (their properties became equal to it). This is how B-ZA-M (AHP of Partzuf %0aAA) fell to Sefirot K-H (GE) of Partzuf AVI, B-ZA-M (AHP of Partzuf AVI) fell to %0aSefirot K-H (GE) of Partzuf ZON, and B-ZA-M (AHP of Partzuf ZON) fell below %0aParsa to the worlds of BYA. %0a%0aSefirot K-H (GE) that remained in their degree in their Partzuf are called %0aMI, and Sefirot B-ZA-M that separated (in their properties) and descended (by %0aequivalence in properties) to a lower Partzuf are called ELEH. %0a%0a%0a%0a106 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aTHE CREATOR %0a%0aTHE WORLD OFATZILUT %0a%0a%0a%0aK %0aH %0a%0a%0aAA (the 1st Restriction is in force above AA) %0a%0a%0aD %0a%0aD %0a%0aZA %0aM %0a%0a%0aK %0aH %0a%0a%0aAHP of AA fell to GE of AVI %0a%0a%0a%0a%0aB %0a%0aZA %0aM %0a%0a%0aK %0aH %0a%0a%0aAHP of AVI fell toGEof ZON %0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0aB %0a%0aZA %0aM %0a%0a%0aK %0aH %0a%0a%0aAHP of ZON fell to GE of BYA %0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0aM %0a%0a%0aAHP of BYA fell to the point of our world - in the sensation %0aof a person who has attained the level of "our world" %0a%0a%0a%0aBUT AS THE LETTERS ELEH DESCEND FROM ABOVE-when Malchut %0ais expelled from Bina, the letters ELEH get detached from AVI and fall to ZON %0a(a lower degree), and clothe themselves in ZON: ELEH of Aba (YESHS - Israel %0aSaba) clothe ZA, and ELEH of Ima {Tvuna) clothe Malchut. Bina of the world of %0aAtzilut is a complex Partzuf: her GE constitute AVI (two Partzufim), and her AHP %0ahave the name of a separate Partzuf YESHS UT, for they fulfill separate functions %0awith regard to ZON: Bina-. GE = MI = GE of Aba + Ml = GE of Ima. ELEH = AHP %0aof Aba = YESHS (Israel Saba) + T (Tvuna) = ELEH = AHP of Ima. %0a%0aWhen Ohr Haya descends from Above (as a result of which Malchut descends %0afrom Bina's level back to her own place), three Sefirot B-ZA-M thereby return to %0atheir degree, and correspondingly, Sefirot KHB (called the "holy of holies") enter %0athe now complete Partzuf consisting of five Sefirot. (Here, the Light is called by %0athe name of the Sefirot it fills.) Previously, there was only Ohr Ruach-Ne/esh in %0aK-H, and now Ohr Neshama-Haya-Yechida was added to KHB, while Ruach-Nefesh %0adescended to ZA-M. %0a%0aHowever, when AHP of Rosh de AA (B-ZA-M of Rosh de AA) that fell to its %0aGuf ascend (return from Guf to Rosh de AA), the Kelim of GE de AVI ascend %0aalong with them to Rosh de AA. (These are the Kelim of GE de AVI that were %0aclothed in AHP de AA in their small state, when AHP de AA had fallen to GE %0ade AVI.) Once there, the Kelim of GE de AVI receive the Light called "holy of %0aholies" that shines in Rosh de AA. %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Mother Lends Her Clothes to Her Daughter %0a%0a%0a%0a107 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe reason for this is that when the Upper One descends to the lower one, %0ait becomes like the lower one. And when the lower one ascends to the Upper %0aOne it becomes like the Upper One. This is because no space or motion exist in %0athe spiritual, and only a change of properties instantly and automatically moves %0aa Partzuf or its part in spiritual space, closer (higher) to the Creator or farther %0aaway (lower) from Him. Therefore, spiritual ascent itself implies a change of %0aproperties of the lower one to those of the Upper One, and a descent of the %0aUpper One signifies that its properties became equal to the properties of the %0adegree to which it descended. %0a%0aHence, in Katnut, when Sefirot B-ZA-M = AHP de Rosh of Partzuf AA separate %0afrom its head and fall (move according to their now inferior properties) to its %0aGuf, from Peh to Chazeh, where Partzuf AVI clothes Partzuf AA, they (B-ZA-M = %0aZON = AHP de Rosh of AA) become like AVI in their properties, without Ohr %0aHochma, and only with the Light of Bina, Hassadim. %0a%0aThat is why, in Gadlut, when B-ZA-M = AHP de AA return to the Rosh (the %0adegree that is higher than Guf), they take with them GE of AVI, as they all became %0aone degree while in Katnut. Therefore, in Gadlut, GE of AVI ascend from AHP %0ade Rosh of AA to Rosh de AA and become equal to it (in their properties), where %0athey receive the Light called "holy of holies" that shines in Rosh de AA. %0a%0aZON ascend to AVI in the same way: after AVI receive the Light in Rosh %0ade AA, they acquire strength (screen), and lower Malchut from Bina back to %0aher place in Malchut, thereby enabling their Sefirot B-ZA-M = AHP to return to %0atheir degree, AVI, as in AA. However, when the Kelim-Sefirot B-ZA-M = AHP %0ade Bina that were inside K-H = GE de ZON ascend to AVI, they also take with %0athem Sefirot of ZON, which they've clothed-K-H = GE de ZON. Thus, K-H = %0aGE de ZON ascend to AVI and there receive the Light called "holy of holies," %0athe Light of Hay a. %0a%0aTherefore, it is written that Ima-MOTHER DESCENDS TO HER %0aDAUGHTER TO DRESS AND ADORN HER: the letters ELEH or Ima %0a(Bina) in her small state descend to Malchut. This means that THE MOTHER %0aDESCENDS TO HER DAUGHTER, for the three Sefirot of Ima assumed the %0aproperty of Malchut, thereby separating from Bina and becoming a part of %0aMalchut. This is akin to Bina giving part of her Kelim to Malchut. Yet, this gift is %0atemporary, as though Bina LENDS, GIVES (these Kelim) FOR TEMPORARY %0aUSE, and thus, Malchut uses them temporarily. %0a%0aAnd then, Ima-Bina (mother) ADORNS HER DAUGHTER WITH HER %0aADORNMENTS. This is so because in Gadlut, when the three Sefirot ELEH %0a%0a%0a%0a108 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0areturn to Bina, Malchut ascends to the degree of Bina together with them, %0aand there receives the Light of "holy of holies." And since an ascent to Bina %0aimplies becoming like Bina (in properties), she now has the right to receive the %0asame Light as Bina. %0a%0aIt turns out that, as a result of the mother lowering her Kelim (properties) %0aELEH to her daughter by intentionally assuming the properties (desires) of %0aMalchut instead of her own properties (desires), thereby entering the small state %0aand willingly diminishing herself, upon receiving the properties of Malchut %0ainstead of properties of Bina, mother Bina adorned her daughter Malchut with %0aher adornments, meaning the Light that subsequently comes in the state of %0aGadlut: the Light of Bina entered Malchut. This is described as "Malchut received %0aher adornments." %0a%0aThere are two kinds of adornments that the daughter Malchut receives %0afrom her mother Bina: the first is Ohr Hochma (Ohr Haya, the Light of GAR), %0athe Light of perfection, for it imparts the property of perfection to the Kli %0athat it is filling, the Light that Malchut receives from Ima (Supernal Mother), %0awho stands between Peh and Chazeh of Partzuf AA, above its Parsa. The second %0aadornment is Ohr Neshama, which still designates imperfection, as it is received %0afrom the lower mother, Partzuf of Tvuna that stands between Chazeh and Tabur %0ade AA, below its Parsa. %0a%0aNaturally, to receive either Light, Malchut must ascend to the corresponding %0adegree. In other words, she must change her properties so as to be able to receive, %0ato merit that Light. %0a%0aWhen Malchut ascends to Tvuna and receives her adornments from Tvuna, %0athese adornments are still imperfect, for Malchut remains with a "question" %0a(without the Light of Hochma), as Tvuna was before the raising of MAN. This %0ameans that to attain perfection, Malchut still needs to receive MAN from the %0alower ones, called the "husbands of Israel." In this state, the lower ones, called %0athe righteous or "the husbands of Israel," receive the Light from ZA, which %0aascended to YESHS = hrael-Saha. %0a%0aHowever, when Malchut ascends another degree, to the place of the Supernal %0aMother, Bina, above Chazeh de AA, and there receives her adornments from Ima %0aand not from Tvuna, then these adornments are perfect, for they contain Ohr %0aHaya; there is no more "question" in her, as she is considered a male, bestowing %0aKli, and the husbands of Israel receive from her. %0a%0aAnd all the husbands of Israel appear before her and receive the Light from %0aher. And Malchut is CALLED MASTER (Hebrew - Adon). The regular Malchut %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Mother Lends Her Clothes to Her Daughter %0a%0a%0a%0a109 %0a%0a%0a%0ais called by the Creator's female name Adonay (mistress) or ADM, whereas in %0athis state she is called by the male name Adon (master). %0a%0aAnd this is because Malchut no longer has a question, for MAN is no longer %0araised within her, as she has reached perfection (Light of Haya) and is therefore %0acalled "husband" or master (Adon). Hence, the prophet said: BEHOLD THE %0aARK OF THE COVENANT, THE MASTER (Adon) OF ALL THE EARTH %0a(Yehoshua, 3:11). Malchut is called the "Ark," for ZA, who bestows upon her, %0ais called the "Covenant." The Zohar calls Malchut the "Master of all the earth" %0aor "husband." %0a%0aAs a result of the letter Hey in the word MA (Mem-Hey), signifying the female %0aessence, leaving Malchut, for the letter Hey signifies the presence of a question in %0aMalchut, i.e., the absence of Ohr Hochma, whereas Ohr Hochma brings absolute %0aknowledge, all questions disappear, and with them the letter Hey. The letter Yod %0aascends to the place of Hey, and Malchut assumes the name MI as Ima, which %0asignifies Malchut's reception of the name Elokim, as the name Ima. %0a%0a18. Israel receives the last letters (ELEH) from Above, from Bina down to %0athat place, i.e., to Malchut, who is now called MI, just like the name Bina. I %0apronounce the letters ELEH and my whole soul weeps so as to receive these %0aletters ELEH from Bina into the house of Elokim, which is Malchut. So that %0aMalchut would be called Elokim, just as Bina is called Elokim. How can I %0areceive them? "With joyous songs of praise sung in the voice of the Torah, and %0afestive throngs" (Tehilim, 42:4). Rabbi Elazar said, "My silence has erected the %0aTemple Above, which is Bina, and the Temple below, which is Malchut. Of %0acourse, as people say, 'A word is worth a gold coin (Hebrew - Sela), but silence %0ais worth two.' So the words 'a word is worth a gold coin' mean that I spoke %0aand came to regret it. Silence, my silence, is worth twice as much, for the two %0aworlds, Bina and Malchut, were created by this silence. For had I not kept %0asilent (see item 11), I would not have attained the unity of both worlds." %0a%0aAfter Hey has left MA and Yod ascended in her place, thereby forming MI, %0aIsrael elevates the LAST LETTERS ELEH to Malchut by raising MAN. As we've %0aalready explained, in Katnut, ELEH of the Upper One fell to GE of the lower %0aone. Hence, they refer to the lower one in Gadlut as well. For when B-ZA-M = %0aELEH of the Upper One return to its Rosh, they thereby elevate GE of the lower %0aone, too. The lower one thus acquires the ELEH of the Upper One and the %0aLight with which they filled themselves in their present Gadlut. %0a%0aTo equalize with the lower one and enter the state of Katnut, the Upper %0aOne deliberately makes Tzimtzum Bet on its AHP. And upon connecting to the %0a%0a%0a%0a110 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0alower one, the Upper One returns to the state of Gadlut, and passes the Light to %0athat part of the lower one which they've both occupied in the state of Katnut. %0a%0aThis scenario is similar to one when a good, strong person joins a company %0aof wicked men, and connects with them by pretending to be like them. And %0awhen such contact is established between them, he begins to correct them, %0alittle by little, precisely through this connection that has formed between %0athem beforehand. %0a%0aEach Partzuf in the small state is divided into two parts: GE and AHP. %0aHowever, since there is a "column" of Partzufim between our world and the %0aCreator, there is a connection between them via the common parts of the upper %0aand the lower ones. Precisely because there is a part of an Upper One in each %0alower one, the lower one can receive strength from Above, through this common %0aproperty, and ascend independently up to the Creator Himself. %0a%0aEach Upper One that falls to the lower one completes its Kelim to ten Sefirot: %0aAHP fall to GE of the lower one, and together they make up ten Sefirot, since %0athey stand at the same level. In turn, AHP of the lower one falls into GE of the %0anext lower one, and so on. %0a%0aAfterwards, in Gadlut, when GE of the Upper One receive the strength to %0aattach their AHP to themselves and elevate them, GE of the lower one ascend %0atogether with AHP, as they were joined below. Therefore, upon ascending, GE of %0athe lower one continue to be joined with AHP of the Upper One, and together %0athey form a Partzuf of ten Sefirot. %0a%0aI PRONOUNCE THE LETTERS ELEH: Israel (one who wishes to receive %0athe properties of the Creator) raises MAN (prayer for it) to receive in Malchut %0athe Light of Gadlut (for self-correction) with the help of the letters ELEH, Ima- %0aBina. This is achieved by praying near the Gates of Tears, after which no one %0aever returns empty-handed, that is, after raising MAN, ELEH descend from AVI %0ato Malchut, the house of Elokim. This is because after receiving ELEH, Malchut %0aherself receives the name Elokim, just like Ima. %0a%0aA WORD IS WORTH A GOLD COIN, BUT SILENCE IS WORTH %0aTWO: the words (spiritual action) of Rabbi Elazar (the spiritual Partzuf of that %0aname) elevated Malchut to Tvuna, below Chazeh de AA, where there is still no %0aLight of Hochma, which designates the presence of a question in Malchut, a %0arequest for Ohr Hochma. And this is called "gold" (Hebrew - Sela, a gold coin), %0afor that is the name of Malchut. %0a%0aHowever, Rabbi Elazar's silence enabled Rabbi Shimon to reveal Ohr %0aHaya by raising Malchut to the Supernal Mother, whereupon both worlds were %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Mother Lends Her Clothes to Her Daughter %0a%0a%0a%0a111 %0a%0a%0a%0asimultaneously created, for the lower world, Malchut, was created together with %0athe Upper World, Bina, of which The Zohar speaks: SILENCE IS WORTH %0aTWICE (two worlds) AS MUCH. %0a%0a19. Rabbi Shimon said, "From here on the perfection of the written is said to %0abring forth their host by number." For these are two degrees, and each must %0abe recorded, that is, noted: one is called MA and the other MI. MI is the %0aUpper One, and MA is the lower one. The Upper Degree registers, speaks, %0aand brings forth their hosts by number, where the letter Hey alludes to the %0aone that is known and unequaled, namely MI. This is similar to the phrase, %0a"HaMotzi Lechem"— He who brings forth bread from the earth (an appeal to %0athe Creator), where the letter Hey refers to the knowledge of the known, lower %0adegree, namely MA. And together they are one degree, Malchut. However, the %0aUpper One is MI de Malchut and the lower one is MA de Malchut, the one %0athat brings forth their host by number, for the number 600,000 refers to the %0anumber of stars that stand together, and they bring forth innumerable hosts. %0a%0aThe Zohar alludes to the words of the prophet (Yeshayahu, 40:26): "Raise %0ayour eyes to the height of Heavens and see: WHO HAS CREATED THESE %0a(them) - MI BARAH ELEH? He that brings out their host by number, He calls %0athem all by name; no one shall be hidden from the greatness of His might and %0athe force of His power." %0a%0aThe word "recording" means "marked by the letter Hey," for two degrees %0amust be recorded in Malchut: MI and MA. With the help of the Light that is %0areceived at the time of ascent above Chazeh de AA to the Upper World, Malchut %0abecomes like the upper world and assumes the name MI, for the letter Hey exits %0aMA (Mem-Hey), and the letter Yod ascends to its place. Thus, Malchut is called %0aMI, like the Upper World, and is adorned with the male property. %0a%0aNevertheless, MA, the previous degree of Malchut, does not disappear. The %0areason for this is that the degree of MI is essential in order to pass the Light, the %0aperfection of the "holy of holies" to the generations, the posterity of Malchut, %0aNRN of the righteous, the lower ones. However, the birth and procreation of %0athese generations (sons) depend on the name MA. Hence, if either (MA or MI) %0ais missing in Malchut, she will not be able to beget future generations, to create %0anew souls (lower Partzufim filled with Light). %0a%0aTherefore, Malchut BRINGS OUT THEIR HOST BY NUMBER-this %0ais the degree of MI, which Malchut inherits from the Supernal Mother, for %0athe letter Hey before the words "brings out" (Motzi = HaMotzi) alludes to the %0afact that Malchut contains the perfect Light, called "adornments," which she %0a%0a%0a%0a112 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0areceives from AVI. This is the maximal Light that may fill Malchut during the %0a6,000 years. %0a%0aThe same letter, Hey, designates the presence of the Light of YESHSUT, the %0adegree of MA within Malchut. For this degree must also be recorded, be present %0ain Malchut. And these two degrees, MI and MA, are present in Malchut: Ml %0aabove and MA below. %0a%0aThe Zohar calls Malchut the "world being revealed." That is to say, whatever %0aMalchut reveals, the lower ones receive. Those individual attainments, individual %0asensations of the Light that descend from Malchut are what they call "their %0aworld." Similarly, whatever we feel in our sensory organs is what we call "our %0aworld." But this is nothing more than what we receive from Malchut of the %0alowest degree in the world of Assiya, Malchut of the previous degree. %0a%0aHowever, we should know that the actual notion of "our world" indicates %0athe true attainment of the degree called "our world," i.e., man's sensation of his %0aultimate disconnection from the Creator, total helplessness, and the realization %0aof his absolute egoism. One can attain this sensation only if the spiritual Light %0ashines on him from Above, in contrast to which he will see his true spiritual %0astate. However, in order to reach such a state, one must make great efforts in the %0astudy of Kabbalah so as to draw upon himself the influence of the Surrounding %0aLight ("Introduction to The Study of Ten Sefirot," item 155). %0a%0aHowever, when man attains this state, he immediately raises such a request %0ato the Creator that his MAN is not left unanswered, and he receives the strength %0ato transcend "our world" and ascend with his properties to a Higher Degree— %0aMalchut of the world of Assiya. And then it is she that becomes his world. %0a%0aHere we are speaking about very high degrees. The Malchut that is being %0arevealed is Malchut of the world of Atzilut, Nukva de ZA. And the fact that The %0aZohar calls her "Supernal" indicates the state of Malchut when she attains the %0adegree of MI during her ascent and clothing the Upper World, the Supernal %0aMother. Therefore, Malchut herself is then called "Supernal," and the degree of %0aMA is, accordingly, called "lower." %0a%0aKNOWS ALL THE HOSTS BY NUMBER: number designates perfection. %0aLight without a number indicates that the Light is imperfect, whereas the Light %0awith a number is perfect. The action of ZA with regard to passing the Light from %0aBina to Malchut is described in the phrase: THE HEAVENS TELL OF THE %0aCREATOR'S GREATNESS. THE HEAVENS (ZA) TELL (Hebrew-Mesaf>er, %0afrom the word Mispar— number, the Light's perfection). ZA passes this Light %0afrom AVI to Malchut, called THE CREATOR'S GREATNESS. %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Mother Lends Her Clothes to Her Daughter %0a%0a%0a%0a113 %0a%0a%0a%0aThis Light is called 600,000, for the degree of Malchut designates units, %0athe degree of ZA— tens, the degree of YESHSLT— hundreds, the degree of AVI— %0athousands, the degree of AA— tens of thousands. %0a%0aThere are two parts in AVI: their own part, where they are regarded as %0athousands, and the part from Ohr Hochma that is received from Rosh de AA, where %0athey are regarded as AA, that is, tens of thousands. However, they cannot be %0aconsidered a complete degree of AA, but only as its VAK, for they clothe AA from %0athe Peh down to the Chazeh. And since VAK = Vav Ketzavot = 6 Sefirot x 10 = 60, %0athe degree of VAK de AA equals 60 x 10,000 = 600,000. %0a%0aTherefore, when Malchut ascends to AVI, she receives a complete, perfect %0anumber— 600,000, where 60 signifies that it is merely VAK, for Malchut has %0anot yet reached Rosh de AA and that she still lacks this degree. And the degree %0aof 10,000 refers to AA, the part that clothes in AVI, for AVI are VAK de AA. %0aTherefore, Malchut contains the number 600,000. %0a%0aThus, two degrees are recorded in Malchut: %0a%0a- MI, the degree of AVI that clothes in Malchut, through which Malchut %0areceives the degree of the Upper World and is called accordingly, %0awhile the Light in it is called 600,000. %0a%0a- MA, the degree of YESHSL/T that clothes in Malchut, through which %0aMalchut has a question, the sensation of lack of Ohr Hochma, and the %0arequest for its reception. Malchut is therefore called the "lower world." %0a%0aThese two degrees create one Partzuf within Malchut: her part that is above %0athe Chazeh is clothed in AVI, and her part that is below the Chazeh is clothed in %0aYESHSL/T. Therefore, in the generations, in Malchut's descendants, each Partzuf %0aconsists of two parts (degrees): from the Upper Part (MI) there is a Light of %0a600,000, and from the lower part (lower world, MA), there is an absence of %0anumber (perfection) in each descendant. %0a%0aThe phrase, THEY BRING FORTH INNUMERABLE HOSTS is not %0ainterpreted as infinitely big. Rather, "Innumerable" indicates the imperfection %0aof the Light that is received in the lower part, as it comes from YESHSL/T, the %0adegree that is without a number. %0a%0aMalchut's descendants are therefore defined as imperfect, as these two %0adegrees exist in her as one, and are connected as one. Hence, there are two %0adegrees in Malchut's descendants: the Upper One— 600,000, and the lower %0aone— without a number. However, the lower one is defined as supplement to %0aperfection and is not considered a flaw. %0a%0a%0a%0a114 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aThe reason for this is that the blessing of the seed, propagation depends %0aonly on the lower world, MA, without a number, as it is said in the Torah that %0aAvraham complained that he is childless (Beresheet, 15:5), and the answer was: %0a"Look now toward Heaven, and count the stars. Will you be able to count them? %0aSo shall be your descendants." From this we see that the blessing of the seed %0acomes from the lack of a number, i.e., the name MA. %0a%0aHence, after all the perfection that Malchut attains from the Light of AVI %0a(Ml), Malchut has an additional blessing from MA, which is called the "lack of %0aa number," and both these degrees are included in her descendants— the souls %0aand generations. %0a%0a20. All of these 600,000 and all their innumerable hosts, He calls the names. %0aWhat does this mean: "calls the names?" If you say that He calls them by their %0anames, it is not so, for then it would have said, "calls by name." However, %0awhen this degree does not ascend in the name Elokim, but is called MI, %0ait does not beget and does not reveal those that are concealed within it. %0aAnd although they were all concealed within it, meaning that even though %0athe letters ELEH have already ascended, the "precious garment" of Ohr %0aHassadim is still concealed. And while it is concealed, it is not called by the %0aname Elokim. For He created the letters ELEH and they ascended in His %0aName— clothed themselves in "precious garments" of Ohr Hassadim, as a %0aresult of which ELEH combine with MI, and are called Elo'im. Then, by %0athe power of this name, He brought them forth in perfection, defined as %0aCALLS THEIR NAMES, which means that He called by name and brought %0aforth every type and species to exist in perfection. Hence, it is said: HE %0aBROUGHT FORTH THEIR HOST BY NUMBER— called them all by %0aname, that is, by the name Elokim. %0a%0aIt was already mentioned that the perfection of the Light, which is the %0aCreator's name Elo-im, descends to the souls, generations, descendants, two %0adegrees joined in one. This degree includes 600,000 from the Upper Degree, %0aand innumerable hosts from the lower, and the Creator's name descends on %0aboth of them. %0a%0aThe blessing of the seed depends entirely on MA, for it is determined by %0aOhr Hochma, as this Light designates perfection. Whereas the Light without %0aa number, Ohr Hassadim, comes precisely from the name MA. As is already %0aknown, Ohr Hochma is accepted only when clothed in Ohr Hassadim. Until such %0aclothing occurs, even though ELEH ascend to MI, the name Elokim (ELO-IM = %0aELEH + IM) does not act. %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Mother Lends Her Clothes to Her Daughter %0a%0a%0a%0a115 %0a%0a%0a%0aHence, it is written that MI DOES NOT BEGET (ANY OFFSPRING), %0aeven though the point of Malchut left the thought (Bina) and descended back %0ato her place, and all ten Sefirot and the Light returned to the Partzuf, THE %0aNAME ELEH IS still CONCEALED, for she still cannot receive Hochma in the %0aabsence of Hassadim. %0a%0aHowever, BECAUSE HE CREATED ELEH, meaning that after He added a %0aZivug to the screen of MA (lower world, Malchut), there appeared Ohr Hassadim, %0acalled WITHOUT A NUMBER. And ELEH were filled with Ohr Hassadim, %0awhich means BARAH = CREATED ELEH, as clothing in Ohr Hassadim is called %0aBARAH (creation). Only after this are they called ELOKIM, for only after the %0areception of Ohr Hassadim can they receive Ohr Hochma, called "the Light of a %0anumber," the Light of 600,000, as a result of which, the letters combine and %0aform the complete name Elokim. %0a%0aThe same perfection (clothing of Hochma in Hassadim) also extends to %0athe souls and descendants that emerge from the name Elokim. AND HE IS %0aCALLED BY THIS NAME: all that emerges is called by this name, with these %0aproperties He creates all descendants— Partzufim from His Zivug on Ohr Hochma. %0aTHE NAME 600,000 is Hochma, TOGETHER WITH HASSADIM, so that they %0awill have the perfection of the name, so that Light will clothe Light, as they are %0aclothed in the NAME. It is therefore written: SEE, I CALL THEM BY NAME, %0afor "to call" means to revive and bring to perfection. %0a%0a21. He asks, "What is the meaning of 'by the greatness of His might and %0awealth?'" This is the head of the degree, where all desires ascend and remain %0aconcealed. The strong one that ascended in the name Elokim, as it is said, %0a"This is the secret of the Upper World, called MI." No man is missing from %0athe 600,000 that He created by the power of this name. And because no one %0ais missing from these 600,000, it follows that wherever the sons of Israel %0aperished and were punished for their transgressions, we subsequently find %0athat not one from the 600,000 had disappeared, so that everything would %0aremain the same Above and below. And just as no one had disappeared from %0athe 600,000 Above, no one has disappeared from this number below. %0a%0aFROM THE GREATNESS OF HIS MIGHT AND WEALTH signifies %0aKeter de AVI, called the HEAD OF DEGREES. This is Bina of AA, which %0abecame Keter de Partzuf AVI, WHERE ALL DESIRES ASCEND (MAN of the %0alower ones), and receive all the degrees from there. This degree is filled with %0aOhr Hassadim, and exists in perfection even in the absence of Ohr Hochma, as its %0aLight of Hassadim comes from GAR de BINA of AA. In other words, it has such %0a%0a%0a%0a116 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aa powerful Light of Hassadim that although this degree emerged from Rosh de %0aAA, it is not regarded as having left it, for it feels no need for Ohr Hochma. This %0adegree, Keter of AVI, is the Rosh of all the degrees in the world of Atzilut, from %0awhere AVI, YESHSUT and ZON receive the Light. %0a%0aTHE STRONG ONE IS THE SECRET OF THE UPPER WORLD, the %0aproperty of MI that is present in Malchut, from where the number 600,000 %0adescends, for she clothes the Upper World, AVI. Therefore, it is written that %0aNO ONE DISAPPEARS FROM THOSE 600,000 because there Malchut %0areceives Ohr Hochma, called "600,000 " Hence, it is said that AS NO ONE %0aDISAPPEARED ABOVE, SO IT IS BELOW, for Malchut clothes AVI, described %0ain the phrase: THE MOTHER ADORNS HER DAUGHTER WITH HER %0aOWN ADORNMENTS, by which Malchut becomes completely similar to AVI. %0aAnd just as the Light of AVI is perfect (which is why it is called "600,000" and %0aNO ONE HAS DISAPPEARED, i.e., no lack of Ohr Hochma is felt), Malchut is %0aperfect in this number, which means NO ONE HAS DISAPPEARED below.

Heaven, Earth, and all that inhabit them were created by MA, which is %0a%3c Malchut, as it is said: "When I behold your Heavens, the work of your hands" %0a%3c (Tehilim, 8:4). And before this, it is said, "MA - WHAT (How) majestic Your %0a%3c name is throughout the earth, which You established above the Heavens" %0a%3c (Tehilim, 8:2). After all, the Heavens were created by the name (property) %0a%3c MA (Malchut). It is written "in the Heavens," which refers to Bina, called %0a%3c MI, the Heavens that are above ZA. The explanation for this lies in the name %0a%3c Elokim. MA (Malchut) ascends and enters with her properties into Bina, %0a%3c i.e., connects into Bina, and receives her properties. Bina is called Elokim. %0a%3c After He CREATED LIGHT FOR LIGHT, meaning Ohr (Light) Hassadim %0a%3c (called "precious adornments or garments") so as to clothe Ohr Hochma, %0a%3c Ohr Hassadim clothes Ohr Hochma, which signifies the creation of Light for %0a%3c Light; by the force of the Supernal Name Elokim (Bina), Malchut ascends, %0a%3c and, upon joining Bina, receives all of her properties, and includes herself in %0a%3c Bina. Therefore, BERESHEET BARAH ELOKIM (In the beginning the %0a%3c Creator created) refers to the Supernal Elokim, to Bina and not to Malchut. %0a%3c For MA (Malchut) is not created by the name MI ELEH. %0a%3c %0a%3c The lower world (Malchut, MA) receives the Light (marked from Above %0a%3c by the name Elokim) from Bina. This Light brings Malchut strength, and the %0a%3c properties suitable for the creation of Heaven, earth, and posterity manifest %0a%3c within her. After all, there cannot be any posterity or birth of new generations %0a%3c without the Light of Haya. %0a%3c %0a%3c And this is what The Zohar tells us: so does the lower world (Malchut, MA) %0a%3c exist by the name Elokim, by the name from the Upper World, which is why %0a%3c %0a%3c 101 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 102 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c there's strength in Malchut (Ohr Hochma) to create generations. And if Malchut %0a%3c has Ohr Hochma, then the world can be created by her. %0a%3c %0a%3c (Haya is one type of Ohr Hochma. There is one Light that the Creator %0a%3c emanates, or rather, the sensation of the Creator we refer to as Light. This %0a%3c sensation depends on the desires-Kelim in which we feel Him. And since there %0a%3c are only two types of desires-Kelim, those of "bestowal" and those of "reception," %0a%3c there exist only two types of Light, Hassadim and Hochma. However, each of %0a%3c them includes several subtypes, and Ohr Haya constitutes a particular form of %0a%3c Ohr Hochma. This is because Hochma is the Light or pleasure that is felt by the %0a%3c will "to receive," whereas Hassadim is the pleasure that is felt by the will "to %0a%3c bestow." If only the Kelim of bestowal (GE) are present in the Partzuf, it is filled %0a%3c with Ohr Hassadim; and if it has the strength to receive for the Creator's sake, it %0a%3c is filled with Ohr Hochma.) (Do not confuse this with MA, which is used here, %0a%3c where MA = Malchut with ZA = MA in Gematria). %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar explains that the Light descends from the name Elokim thanks %0a%3c to the merging of MI and ELEH. ZA is called "Heaven." YESHSUT is above %0a%3c Heaven (ZA). There is no MI in Heaven (ZA), only MA. However, after Ohr %0a%3c Hassadim clothes Ohr Hochma (the Light ELEH = AHP clothes the Light of MA %0a%3c = GE), all the letters combine and ascend by the name Elokim above Heaven = %0a%3c ZA = MA to YESHSUT = Bina = MI. %0a%3c %0a%3c MI (Bina) is above the second restriction, above its ban, as her properties %0a%3c are higher, better than those to which the restriction extends: the property %0a%3c of Bina is "not to receive anything," which is why the ban of the second %0a%3c restriction— to not receive— simply does not apply to her, for in her essence, %0a%3c she has no desire to receive. %0a%3c %0a%3c There remains only the ban of T^imt^um Alef>h, the restriction imposed on %0a%3c the reception of Light in Malchut herself (Malchut de Malchut), the central point %0a%3c of all creation, the only creating being. Malchut herself is egoistic, but if she has %0a%3c a Masach and only receives the Light by means of a Zivug de Hakaa (resistance %0a%3c to one's own desire, only for the Creator's sake) on the desires of bestowal, such %0a%3c reception does not occur in Malchut, but rather in the first nine Sefirot. Hence, %0a%3c Malchut can receive the Light in her first nine Sefirot. %0a%3c %0a%3c In other words, if Malchut has the will (strength) to receive (enjoy) the Light %0a%3c (pleasure) not for herself, but only because the Creator so desires, then she %0a%3c receives only this amount of Light (pleasure). In order to receive the Light under %0a%3c such a condition, Malchut (man's inclination to pleasure and enjoyment) must %0a%3c first reject all incoming pleasure, which Malchut perceives to be right there before %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Mother Lends Her Clothes to Her Daughter %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 103 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c her. This is referred to as the Light's (the pleasure's) impact against the screen %0a%3c and its reflection off the screen (the reflection of pleasure by force of will so as %0a%3c to not receive, in spite of the natural, primordial desire to receive pleasure). %0a%3c %0a%3c The reflected pleasure is called Ohr Hassadim. Essentially, this is not a Light, %0a%3c but rather Malchut's intention to receive only for the Creator's sake. However, %0a%3c this intention is that necessary and sufficient condition for the subsequent %0a%3c reception of Ohr Hochma from the Creator. For after Malchut repelled all the %0a%3c Light (expressed her intention to not receive for her own sake), she thereby %0a%3c met the condition of Tzimtzum Aleph (first restriction) to only receive the Light %0a%3c of Hochma in the intention for the Creator's sake, which is called Ohr Hozer %0a%3c (Returning Light) or Ohr Hassadim. And now she can receive Ohr Hochma, the %0a%3c pleasure that the Creator wants to bestow upon her. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, by receiving this Light, Malchut is no more a mere recipient- %0a%3c creature. Now, like the Creator, she bestows pleasure upon Him! In this %0a%3c manner, the creature attains the degree of the Creator, becomes equal to Him %0a%3c in properties, for it wants to bestow everything. This is called "being filled with %0a%3c Ohr Hassadim." Moreover, Malchut receives and enjoys, for if she does not feel %0a%3c pleasure, she will not please the Creator. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, Malchut receives, meaning she is filled with Ohr Hochma, full of %0a%3c wisdom and pleasure, from both bestowal and reception for the Creator's sake. %0a%3c And herein lies the perfection of the Creator's Creation: she becomes perfect %0a%3c and similar to the Creator. And this is the perfection of the Creator's works: His %0a%3c creation can ascend to His level independently! %0a%3c %0a%3c One can imagine one's path from the lows of our world up to the ultimate %0a%3c spiritual peak— the Creator— as a passage through a suite of rooms. In all, %0a%3c between our state and the Creator there are 125 connected, walkthrough %0a%3c rooms. Each room has its own properties, and only those who possess the same %0a%3c properties can be there. If, regardless of reason, man changes his properties, %0a%3c he is automatically moved as though by an invisible current to a room that %0a%3c corresponds to his new properties. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is how one can move between these rooms: an infinitesimal inner %0a%3c change of properties evokes influence of a spiritual force-field upon man, %0a%3c immediately moves to his new place of equilibrium, where his inne %0a%3c completely coincide with the external properties of the spiri %0a%3c ce, there are no guards at the rooms' entrances/ exits; as soon as %0a%3c es himself so as to match the properties of the next, higher room, he is %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 104 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c pleasure %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c s the %0a%3c Lse %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c What properties must one change in order to move from one rc %0a%3c another within this spiritual field? He only needs to alter the type of pie %0a%3c to which he aspires. We cannot help receiving pleasure, for such is the entire %0a%3c material of creation, it is all that was created. However, we can change the object %0a%3c of our aspirations, what it is that we wish to enjoy: either coarse reception, %0a%3c reception of mere necessities, or the Creator being pleased with us that we %0a%3c bestow to Him, that we receive because such is His wish. %0a%3c %0a%3c Our "I," the entity that feels pleasure is present in all of our desires, which %0a%3c ange ceaselessly in terms of both magnitude and the desired object. %0a%3c vex disappears. The only thing of which one should rid himself is %0a%3c sensation that he does something to please this "I." One should aspire to sense %0a%3c the desires of the Creator, how He is pleased with him (just as a mother %0a%3c pleased with her son's achievements). %0a%3c %0a%3c After Malchut decides to receive only for the Creator's sake, i.e., according %0a%3c to the force of her Masach (the force of resistance to her egoistic will to receive %0a%3c pleasure), she receives Ohr Hochma only in accordance with the magnitude of %0a%3c the Returning Light. Or, conversely, one may say that the magnitude of the %0a%3c Returning Light determines man's willpower and his desire to act for the %0a%3c Creator's sake. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, the first nine of Malchut's ten Sefirot are not egoistic, as they are %0a%3c the Creator's properties with which He wishes to correct Malchut. Only the last %0a%3c Sefira of Malchut, Malchut herself, the single creation, called Malchut de Malchut, %0a%3c is egoistic and remains under the ban of the first restriction: Ohr Hochma does %0a%3c not enter where the will to receive pleasure is present. Therefore, the first nine %0a%3c Sefirot can receive the Light of Hochma. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, after the second restriction, in order to correct Malchut and impart %0a%3c the properties of mercy (Hassadim) onto her so she would be able to desire to %0a%3c "bestow," acquire the properties of Bina, and convert her initial, primordial %0a%3c egoism into altruism, Malchut ascended to Partzuf Aha, became Malchut in %0a%3c Partzuf Aha in Bina 's place, while Bina found herself below Malchut. Bina herself %0a%3c can receive Ohr Hochma without any restrictions, even when below Malchut. %0a%3c However, Bina adopted the limitations of Tzimtzum Bet for the sole purpose of %0a%3c correcting Malchut. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, due to the MAN raised by the lower ones, by man's requests for %0a%3c spiritual correction, the Light AB-SAG descends and lowers Malchut from the %0a%3c level of Bina back to her own place: Malchut descends from Bina, and the Light %0a%3c of attainment and wisdom is revealed. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Mother Lends Her Clothes to Her Daughter %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 105 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c As a result of Malchut's descent, Bina purifies herself from all restrictions and %0a%3c limitations and returns to receiving Ohr Hochma. And after the Ohr Hassadim %0a%3c clothes the Ohr Hochma, MI shines in ELEH and the name Elokim is revealed, %0a%3c meaning that Ohr Hochma shines. %0a%3c %0a%3c The structure of the name Elokim cannot be found in MA, for the lower %0a%3c boundary of Heaven (Malchut herself) is limited by Tzimtzum Aleph— the ban %0a%3c imposed on the reception of Ohr Hochma, and by Tzimtzum Bet's 6,000-year long %0a%3c prohibition on the usage of the desires of reception. Hence, The Zohar tells us %0a%3c that the name Elokim was created with MI, and not with MA, by the property %0a%3c received by Malchut upon her ascent to Bina. %0a%3c %0a%3c 17. But as the letters ELEH descend from Above, from Bina down to Malchut, %0a%3c for the mother temporarily lends her clothes to her daughter and adorns her %0a%3c with her own adornments, the name Elokim descends from Bina (mother) %0a%3c to Malchut (daughter). When does she adorn her with her own adornments? %0a%3c When she sees the male essence before her. It is then written of her, "Three %0a%3c times in the year shall all your males appear before the Lord Creator" (Shemot, %0a%3c 34:23). For Malchut is then called by the male name "Master." As it is written: %0a%3c "Behold the Ark of the Union, the Master of all the earth" (Yehoshua, 3:11). %0a%3c The Torah is the Union and the Ark is Malchut, called by the male name %0a%3c "Master." For she received the Kelim (properties, desires) called "clothes," %0a%3c and the Light called "adornments" from her mother, Bina. The letter Hey %0a%3c (A from MA) then leaves MA (Mem + Hey) and the letter Yod (I) enters in %0a%3c its stead, and just like Bina, Malchut assumes the name MI. And then she %0a%3c adorns herself with male clothes, with the clothes of Bina, to accept all the %0a%3c husbands of Israel. %0a%3c %0a%3c As it is written (item 13), Tzimtzum Bet is in force from the Rosh of AA %0a%3c downwards, for Malchut of AA ascended to Bina and created all the lower %0a%3c Partzufim of the world of Atzilut in the property of Tzimtzum Bet. Thus, each %0a%3c Partzuf of AA, AVI and ZON has only two Sefirot K-H, and three Sefirot B-ZA-M %0a%3c separated themselves (their properties) from that degree, and moved to a lower %0a%3c one (their properties became equal to it). This is how B-ZA-M (AHP of Partzuf %0a%3c AA) fell to Sefirot K-H (GE) of Partzuf AVI, B-ZA-M (AHP of Partzuf AVI) fell to %0a%3c Sefirot K-H (GE) of Partzuf ZON, and B-ZA-M (AHP of Partzuf ZON) fell below %0a%3c Parsa to the worlds of BYA. %0a%3c %0a%3c Sefirot K-H (GE) that remained in their degree in their Partzuf are called %0a%3c MI, and Sefirot B-ZA-M that separated (in their properties) and descended (by %0a%3c equivalence in properties) to a lower Partzuf are called ELEH. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 106 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c THE CREATOR %0a%3c %0a%3c THE WORLD OFATZILUT %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c K %0a%3c H %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c AA (the 1st Restriction is in force above AA) %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c D %0a%3c %0a%3c D %0a%3c %0a%3c ZA %0a%3c M %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c K %0a%3c H %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c AHP of AA fell to GE of AVI %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c B %0a%3c %0a%3c ZA %0a%3c M %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c K %0a%3c H %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c AHP of AVI fell toGEof ZON %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c B %0a%3c %0a%3c ZA %0a%3c M %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c K %0a%3c H %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c AHP of ZON fell to GE of BYA %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c M %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c AHP of BYA fell to the point of our world - in the sensation %0a%3c of a person who has attained the level of "our world" %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BUT AS THE LETTERS ELEH DESCEND FROM ABOVE-when Malchut %0a%3c is expelled from Bina, the letters ELEH get detached from AVI and fall to ZON %0a%3c (a lower degree), and clothe themselves in ZON: ELEH of Aba (YESHS - Israel %0a%3c Saba) clothe ZA, and ELEH of Ima {Tvuna) clothe Malchut. Bina of the world of %0a%3c Atzilut is a complex Partzuf: her GE constitute AVI (two Partzufim), and her AHP %0a%3c have the name of a separate Partzuf YESHS UT, for they fulfill separate functions %0a%3c with regard to ZON: Bina-. GE = MI = GE of Aba + Ml = GE of Ima. ELEH = AHP %0a%3c of Aba = YESHS (Israel Saba) + T (Tvuna) = ELEH = AHP of Ima. %0a%3c %0a%3c When Ohr Haya descends from Above (as a result of which Malchut descends %0a%3c from Bina's level back to her own place), three Sefirot B-ZA-M thereby return to %0a%3c their degree, and correspondingly, Sefirot KHB (called the "holy of holies") enter %0a%3c the now complete Partzuf consisting of five Sefirot. (Here, the Light is called by %0a%3c the name of the Sefirot it fills.) Previously, there was only Ohr Ruach-Ne/esh in %0a%3c K-H, and now Ohr Neshama-Haya-Yechida was added to KHB, while Ruach-Nefesh %0a%3c descended to ZA-M. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, when AHP of Rosh de AA (B-ZA-M of Rosh de AA) that fell to its %0a%3c Guf ascend (return from Guf to Rosh de AA), the Kelim of GE de AVI ascend %0a%3c along with them to Rosh de AA. (These are the Kelim of GE de AVI that were %0a%3c clothed in AHP de AA in their small state, when AHP de AA had fallen to GE %0a%3c de AVI.) Once there, the Kelim of GE de AVI receive the Light called "holy of %0a%3c holies" that shines in Rosh de AA. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Mother Lends Her Clothes to Her Daughter %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 107 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The reason for this is that when the Upper One descends to the lower one, %0a%3c it becomes like the lower one. And when the lower one ascends to the Upper %0a%3c One it becomes like the Upper One. This is because no space or motion exist in %0a%3c the spiritual, and only a change of properties instantly and automatically moves %0a%3c a Partzuf or its part in spiritual space, closer (higher) to the Creator or farther %0a%3c away (lower) from Him. Therefore, spiritual ascent itself implies a change of %0a%3c properties of the lower one to those of the Upper One, and a descent of the %0a%3c Upper One signifies that its properties became equal to the properties of the %0a%3c degree to which it descended. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, in Katnut, when Sefirot B-ZA-M = AHP de Rosh of Partzuf AA separate %0a%3c from its head and fall (move according to their now inferior properties) to its %0a%3c Guf, from Peh to Chazeh, where Partzuf AVI clothes Partzuf AA, they (B-ZA-M = %0a%3c ZON = AHP de Rosh of AA) become like AVI in their properties, without Ohr %0a%3c Hochma, and only with the Light of Bina, Hassadim. %0a%3c %0a%3c That is why, in Gadlut, when B-ZA-M = AHP de AA return to the Rosh (the %0a%3c degree that is higher than Guf), they take with them GE of AVI, as they all became %0a%3c one degree while in Katnut. Therefore, in Gadlut, GE of AVI ascend from AHP %0a%3c de Rosh of AA to Rosh de AA and become equal to it (in their properties), where %0a%3c they receive the Light called "holy of holies" that shines in Rosh de AA. %0a%3c %0a%3c ZON ascend to AVI in the same way: after AVI receive the Light in Rosh %0a%3c de AA, they acquire strength (screen), and lower Malchut from Bina back to %0a%3c her place in Malchut, thereby enabling their Sefirot B-ZA-M = AHP to return to %0a%3c their degree, AVI, as in AA. However, when the Kelim-Sefirot B-ZA-M = AHP %0a%3c de Bina that were inside K-H = GE de ZON ascend to AVI, they also take with %0a%3c them Sefirot of ZON, which they've clothed-K-H = GE de ZON. Thus, K-H = %0a%3c GE de ZON ascend to AVI and there receive the Light called "holy of holies," %0a%3c the Light of Hay a. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, it is written that Ima-MOTHER DESCENDS TO HER %0a%3c DAUGHTER TO DRESS AND ADORN HER: the letters ELEH or Ima %0a%3c (Bina) in her small state descend to Malchut. This means that THE MOTHER %0a%3c DESCENDS TO HER DAUGHTER, for the three Sefirot of Ima assumed the %0a%3c property of Malchut, thereby separating from Bina and becoming a part of %0a%3c Malchut. This is akin to Bina giving part of her Kelim to Malchut. Yet, this gift is %0a%3c temporary, as though Bina LENDS, GIVES (these Kelim) FOR TEMPORARY %0a%3c USE, and thus, Malchut uses them temporarily. %0a%3c %0a%3c And then, Ima-Bina (mother) ADORNS HER DAUGHTER WITH HER %0a%3c ADORNMENTS. This is so because in Gadlut, when the three Sefirot ELEH %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 108 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c return to Bina, Malchut ascends to the degree of Bina together with them, %0a%3c and there receives the Light of "holy of holies." And since an ascent to Bina %0a%3c implies becoming like Bina (in properties), she now has the right to receive the %0a%3c same Light as Bina. %0a%3c %0a%3c It turns out that, as a result of the mother lowering her Kelim (properties) %0a%3c ELEH to her daughter by intentionally assuming the properties (desires) of %0a%3c Malchut instead of her own properties (desires), thereby entering the small state %0a%3c and willingly diminishing herself, upon receiving the properties of Malchut %0a%3c instead of properties of Bina, mother Bina adorned her daughter Malchut with %0a%3c her adornments, meaning the Light that subsequently comes in the state of %0a%3c Gadlut: the Light of Bina entered Malchut. This is described as "Malchut received %0a%3c her adornments." %0a%3c %0a%3c There are two kinds of adornments that the daughter Malchut receives %0a%3c from her mother Bina: the first is Ohr Hochma (Ohr Haya, the Light of GAR), %0a%3c the Light of perfection, for it imparts the property of perfection to the Kli %0a%3c that it is filling, the Light that Malchut receives from Ima (Supernal Mother), %0a%3c who stands between Peh and Chazeh of Partzuf AA, above its Parsa. The second %0a%3c adornment is Ohr Neshama, which still designates imperfection, as it is received %0a%3c from the lower mother, Partzuf of Tvuna that stands between Chazeh and Tabur %0a%3c de AA, below its Parsa. %0a%3c %0a%3c Naturally, to receive either Light, Malchut must ascend to the corresponding %0a%3c degree. In other words, she must change her properties so as to be able to receive, %0a%3c to merit that Light. %0a%3c %0a%3c When Malchut ascends to Tvuna and receives her adornments from Tvuna, %0a%3c these adornments are still imperfect, for Malchut remains with a "question" %0a%3c (without the Light of Hochma), as Tvuna was before the raising of MAN. This %0a%3c means that to attain perfection, Malchut still needs to receive MAN from the %0a%3c lower ones, called the "husbands of Israel." In this state, the lower ones, called %0a%3c the righteous or "the husbands of Israel," receive the Light from ZA, which %0a%3c ascended to YESHS = hrael-Saha. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, when Malchut ascends another degree, to the place of the Supernal %0a%3c Mother, Bina, above Chazeh de AA, and there receives her adornments from Ima %0a%3c and not from Tvuna, then these adornments are perfect, for they contain Ohr %0a%3c Haya; there is no more "question" in her, as she is considered a male, bestowing %0a%3c Kli, and the husbands of Israel receive from her. %0a%3c %0a%3c And all the husbands of Israel appear before her and receive the Light from %0a%3c her. And Malchut is CALLED MASTER (Hebrew - Adon). The regular Malchut %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Mother Lends Her Clothes to Her Daughter %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 109 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c is called by the Creator's female name Adonay (mistress) or ADM, whereas in %0a%3c this state she is called by the male name Adon (master). %0a%3c %0a%3c And this is because Malchut no longer has a question, for MAN is no longer %0a%3c raised within her, as she has reached perfection (Light of Haya) and is therefore %0a%3c called "husband" or master (Adon). Hence, the prophet said: BEHOLD THE %0a%3c ARK OF THE COVENANT, THE MASTER (Adon) OF ALL THE EARTH %0a%3c (Yehoshua, 3:11). Malchut is called the "Ark," for ZA, who bestows upon her, %0a%3c is called the "Covenant." The Zohar calls Malchut the "Master of all the earth" %0a%3c or "husband." %0a%3c %0a%3c As a result of the letter Hey in the word MA (Mem-Hey), signifying the female %0a%3c essence, leaving Malchut, for the letter Hey signifies the presence of a question in %0a%3c Malchut, i.e., the absence of Ohr Hochma, whereas Ohr Hochma brings absolute %0a%3c knowledge, all questions disappear, and with them the letter Hey. The letter Yod %0a%3c ascends to the place of Hey, and Malchut assumes the name MI as Ima, which %0a%3c signifies Malchut's reception of the name Elokim, as the name Ima. %0a%3c %0a%3c 18. Israel receives the last letters (ELEH) from Above, from Bina down to %0a%3c that place, i.e., to Malchut, who is now called MI, just like the name Bina. I %0a%3c pronounce the letters ELEH and my whole soul weeps so as to receive these %0a%3c letters ELEH from Bina into the house of Elokim, which is Malchut. So that %0a%3c Malchut would be called Elokim, just as Bina is called Elokim. How can I %0a%3c receive them? "With joyous songs of praise sung in the voice of the Torah, and %0a%3c festive throngs" (Tehilim, 42:4). Rabbi Elazar said, "My silence has erected the %0a%3c Temple Above, which is Bina, and the Temple below, which is Malchut. Of %0a%3c course, as people say, 'A word is worth a gold coin (Hebrew - Sela), but silence %0a%3c is worth two.' So the words 'a word is worth a gold coin' mean that I spoke %0a%3c and came to regret it. Silence, my silence, is worth twice as much, for the two %0a%3c worlds, Bina and Malchut, were created by this silence. For had I not kept %0a%3c silent (see item 11), I would not have attained the unity of both worlds." %0a%3c %0a%3c After Hey has left MA and Yod ascended in her place, thereby forming MI, %0a%3c Israel elevates the LAST LETTERS ELEH to Malchut by raising MAN. As we've %0a%3c already explained, in Katnut, ELEH of the Upper One fell to GE of the lower %0a%3c one. Hence, they refer to the lower one in Gadlut as well. For when B-ZA-M = %0a%3c ELEH of the Upper One return to its Rosh, they thereby elevate GE of the lower %0a%3c one, too. The lower one thus acquires the ELEH of the Upper One and the %0a%3c Light with which they filled themselves in their present Gadlut. %0a%3c %0a%3c To equalize with the lower one and enter the state of Katnut, the Upper %0a%3c One deliberately makes Tzimtzum Bet on its AHP. And upon connecting to the %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 110 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c lower one, the Upper One returns to the state of Gadlut, and passes the Light to %0a%3c that part of the lower one which they've both occupied in the state of Katnut. %0a%3c %0a%3c This scenario is similar to one when a good, strong person joins a company %0a%3c of wicked men, and connects with them by pretending to be like them. And %0a%3c when such contact is established between them, he begins to correct them, %0a%3c little by little, precisely through this connection that has formed between %0a%3c them beforehand. %0a%3c %0a%3c Each Partzuf in the small state is divided into two parts: GE and AHP. %0a%3c However, since there is a "column" of Partzufim between our world and the %0a%3c Creator, there is a connection between them via the common parts of the upper %0a%3c and the lower ones. Precisely because there is a part of an Upper One in each %0a%3c lower one, the lower one can receive strength from Above, through this common %0a%3c property, and ascend independently up to the Creator Himself. %0a%3c %0a%3c Each Upper One that falls to the lower one completes its Kelim to ten Sefirot: %0a%3c AHP fall to GE of the lower one, and together they make up ten Sefirot, since %0a%3c they stand at the same level. In turn, AHP of the lower one falls into GE of the %0a%3c next lower one, and so on. %0a%3c %0a%3c Afterwards, in Gadlut, when GE of the Upper One receive the strength to %0a%3c attach their AHP to themselves and elevate them, GE of the lower one ascend %0a%3c together with AHP, as they were joined below. Therefore, upon ascending, GE of %0a%3c the lower one continue to be joined with AHP of the Upper One, and together %0a%3c they form a Partzuf of ten Sefirot. %0a%3c %0a%3c I PRONOUNCE THE LETTERS ELEH: Israel (one who wishes to receive %0a%3c the properties of the Creator) raises MAN (prayer for it) to receive in Malchut %0a%3c the Light of Gadlut (for self-correction) with the help of the letters ELEH, Ima- %0a%3c Bina. This is achieved by praying near the Gates of Tears, after which no one %0a%3c ever returns empty-handed, that is, after raising MAN, ELEH descend from AVI %0a%3c to Malchut, the house of Elokim. This is because after receiving ELEH, Malchut %0a%3c herself receives the name Elokim, just like Ima. %0a%3c %0a%3c A WORD IS WORTH A GOLD COIN, BUT SILENCE IS WORTH %0a%3c TWO: the words (spiritual action) of Rabbi Elazar (the spiritual Partzuf of that %0a%3c name) elevated Malchut to Tvuna, below Chazeh de AA, where there is still no %0a%3c Light of Hochma, which designates the presence of a question in Malchut, a %0a%3c request for Ohr Hochma. And this is called "gold" (Hebrew - Sela, a gold coin), %0a%3c for that is the name of Malchut. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, Rabbi Elazar's silence enabled Rabbi Shimon to reveal Ohr %0a%3c Haya by raising Malchut to the Supernal Mother, whereupon both worlds were %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Mother Lends Her Clothes to Her Daughter %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 111 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c simultaneously created, for the lower world, Malchut, was created together with %0a%3c the Upper World, Bina, of which The Zohar speaks: SILENCE IS WORTH %0a%3c TWICE (two worlds) AS MUCH. %0a%3c %0a%3c 19. Rabbi Shimon said, "From here on the perfection of the written is said to %0a%3c bring forth their host by number." For these are two degrees, and each must %0a%3c be recorded, that is, noted: one is called MA and the other MI. MI is the %0a%3c Upper One, and MA is the lower one. The Upper Degree registers, speaks, %0a%3c and brings forth their hosts by number, where the letter Hey alludes to the %0a%3c one that is known and unequaled, namely MI. This is similar to the phrase, %0a%3c "HaMotzi Lechem"— He who brings forth bread from the earth (an appeal to %0a%3c the Creator), where the letter Hey refers to the knowledge of the known, lower %0a%3c degree, namely MA. And together they are one degree, Malchut. However, the %0a%3c Upper One is MI de Malchut and the lower one is MA de Malchut, the one %0a%3c that brings forth their host by number, for the number 600,000 refers to the %0a%3c number of stars that stand together, and they bring forth innumerable hosts. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar alludes to the words of the prophet (Yeshayahu, 40:26): "Raise %0a%3c your eyes to the height of Heavens and see: WHO HAS CREATED THESE %0a%3c (them) - MI BARAH ELEH? He that brings out their host by number, He calls %0a%3c them all by name; no one shall be hidden from the greatness of His might and %0a%3c the force of His power." %0a%3c %0a%3c The word "recording" means "marked by the letter Hey," for two degrees %0a%3c must be recorded in Malchut: MI and MA. With the help of the Light that is %0a%3c received at the time of ascent above Chazeh de AA to the Upper World, Malchut %0a%3c becomes like the upper world and assumes the name MI, for the letter Hey exits %0a%3c MA (Mem-Hey), and the letter Yod ascends to its place. Thus, Malchut is called %0a%3c MI, like the Upper World, and is adorned with the male property. %0a%3c %0a%3c Nevertheless, MA, the previous degree of Malchut, does not disappear. The %0a%3c reason for this is that the degree of MI is essential in order to pass the Light, the %0a%3c perfection of the "holy of holies" to the generations, the posterity of Malchut, %0a%3c NRN of the righteous, the lower ones. However, the birth and procreation of %0a%3c these generations (sons) depend on the name MA. Hence, if either (MA or MI) %0a%3c is missing in Malchut, she will not be able to beget future generations, to create %0a%3c new souls (lower Partzufim filled with Light). %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, Malchut BRINGS OUT THEIR HOST BY NUMBER-this %0a%3c is the degree of MI, which Malchut inherits from the Supernal Mother, for %0a%3c the letter Hey before the words "brings out" (Motzi = HaMotzi) alludes to the %0a%3c fact that Malchut contains the perfect Light, called "adornments," which she %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 112 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c receives from AVI. This is the maximal Light that may fill Malchut during the %0a%3c 6,000 years. %0a%3c %0a%3c The same letter, Hey, designates the presence of the Light of YESHSUT, the %0a%3c degree of MA within Malchut. For this degree must also be recorded, be present %0a%3c in Malchut. And these two degrees, MI and MA, are present in Malchut: Ml %0a%3c above and MA below. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar calls Malchut the "world being revealed." That is to say, whatever %0a%3c Malchut reveals, the lower ones receive. Those individual attainments, individual %0a%3c sensations of the Light that descend from Malchut are what they call "their %0a%3c world." Similarly, whatever we feel in our sensory organs is what we call "our %0a%3c world." But this is nothing more than what we receive from Malchut of the %0a%3c lowest degree in the world of Assiya, Malchut of the previous degree. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, we should know that the actual notion of "our world" indicates %0a%3c the true attainment of the degree called "our world," i.e., man's sensation of his %0a%3c ultimate disconnection from the Creator, total helplessness, and the realization %0a%3c of his absolute egoism. One can attain this sensation only if the spiritual Light %0a%3c shines on him from Above, in contrast to which he will see his true spiritual %0a%3c state. However, in order to reach such a state, one must make great efforts in the %0a%3c study of Kabbalah so as to draw upon himself the influence of the Surrounding %0a%3c Light ("Introduction to The Study of Ten Sefirot," item 155). %0a%3c %0a%3c However, when man attains this state, he immediately raises such a request %0a%3c to the Creator that his MAN is not left unanswered, and he receives the strength %0a%3c to transcend "our world" and ascend with his properties to a Higher Degree— %0a%3c Malchut of the world of Assiya. And then it is she that becomes his world. %0a%3c %0a%3c Here we are speaking about very high degrees. The Malchut that is being %0a%3c revealed is Malchut of the world of Atzilut, Nukva de ZA. And the fact that The %0a%3c Zohar calls her "Supernal" indicates the state of Malchut when she attains the %0a%3c degree of MI during her ascent and clothing the Upper World, the Supernal %0a%3c Mother. Therefore, Malchut herself is then called "Supernal," and the degree of %0a%3c MA is, accordingly, called "lower." %0a%3c %0a%3c KNOWS ALL THE HOSTS BY NUMBER: number designates perfection. %0a%3c Light without a number indicates that the Light is imperfect, whereas the Light %0a%3c with a number is perfect. The action of ZA with regard to passing the Light from %0a%3c Bina to Malchut is described in the phrase: THE HEAVENS TELL OF THE %0a%3c CREATOR'S GREATNESS. THE HEAVENS (ZA) TELL (Hebrew-Mesaf>er, %0a%3c from the word Mispar— number, the Light's perfection). ZA passes this Light %0a%3c from AVI to Malchut, called THE CREATOR'S GREATNESS. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Mother Lends Her Clothes to Her Daughter %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 113 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c This Light is called 600,000, for the degree of Malchut designates units, %0a%3c the degree of ZA— tens, the degree of YESHSLT— hundreds, the degree of AVI— %0a%3c thousands, the degree of AA— tens of thousands. %0a%3c %0a%3c There are two parts in AVI: their own part, where they are regarded as %0a%3c thousands, and the part from Ohr Hochma that is received from Rosh de AA, where %0a%3c they are regarded as AA, that is, tens of thousands. However, they cannot be %0a%3c considered a complete degree of AA, but only as its VAK, for they clothe AA from %0a%3c the Peh down to the Chazeh. And since VAK = Vav Ketzavot = 6 Sefirot x 10 = 60, %0a%3c the degree of VAK de AA equals 60 x 10,000 = 600,000. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, when Malchut ascends to AVI, she receives a complete, perfect %0a%3c number— 600,000, where 60 signifies that it is merely VAK, for Malchut has %0a%3c not yet reached Rosh de AA and that she still lacks this degree. And the degree %0a%3c of 10,000 refers to AA, the part that clothes in AVI, for AVI are VAK de AA. %0a%3c Therefore, Malchut contains the number 600,000. %0a%3c %0a%3c Thus, two degrees are recorded in Malchut: %0a%3c %0a%3c - MI, the degree of AVI that clothes in Malchut, through which Malchut %0a%3c receives the degree of the Upper World and is called accordingly, %0a%3c while the Light in it is called 600,000. %0a%3c %0a%3c - MA, the degree of YESHSL/T that clothes in Malchut, through which %0a%3c Malchut has a question, the sensation of lack of Ohr Hochma, and the %0a%3c request for its reception. Malchut is therefore called the "lower world." %0a%3c %0a%3c These two degrees create one Partzuf within Malchut: her part that is above %0a%3c the Chazeh is clothed in AVI, and her part that is below the Chazeh is clothed in %0a%3c YESHSL/T. Therefore, in the generations, in Malchut's descendants, each Partzuf %0a%3c consists of two parts (degrees): from the Upper Part (MI) there is a Light of %0a%3c 600,000, and from the lower part (lower world, MA), there is an absence of %0a%3c number (perfection) in each descendant. %0a%3c %0a%3c The phrase, THEY BRING FORTH INNUMERABLE HOSTS is not %0a%3c interpreted as infinitely big. Rather, "Innumerable" indicates the imperfection %0a%3c of the Light that is received in the lower part, as it comes from YESHSL/T, the %0a%3c degree that is without a number. %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut's descendants are therefore defined as imperfect, as these two %0a%3c degrees exist in her as one, and are connected as one. Hence, there are two %0a%3c degrees in Malchut's descendants: the Upper One— 600,000, and the lower %0a%3c one— without a number. However, the lower one is defined as supplement to %0a%3c perfection and is not considered a flaw. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 114 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The reason for this is that the blessing of the seed, propagation depends %0a%3c only on the lower world, MA, without a number, as it is said in the Torah that %0a%3c Avraham complained that he is childless (Beresheet, 15:5), and the answer was: %0a%3c "Look now toward Heaven, and count the stars. Will you be able to count them? %0a%3c So shall be your descendants." From this we see that the blessing of the seed %0a%3c comes from the lack of a number, i.e., the name MA. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, after all the perfection that Malchut attains from the Light of AVI %0a%3c (Ml), Malchut has an additional blessing from MA, which is called the "lack of %0a%3c a number," and both these degrees are included in her descendants— the souls %0a%3c and generations. %0a%3c %0a%3c 20. All of these 600,000 and all their innumerable hosts, He calls the names. %0a%3c What does this mean: "calls the names?" If you say that He calls them by their %0a%3c names, it is not so, for then it would have said, "calls by name." However, %0a%3c when this degree does not ascend in the name Elokim, but is called MI, %0a%3c it does not beget and does not reveal those that are concealed within it. %0a%3c And although they were all concealed within it, meaning that even though %0a%3c the letters ELEH have already ascended, the "precious garment" of Ohr %0a%3c Hassadim is still concealed. And while it is concealed, it is not called by the %0a%3c name Elokim. For He created the letters ELEH and they ascended in His %0a%3c Name— clothed themselves in "precious garments" of Ohr Hassadim, as a %0a%3c result of which ELEH combine with MI, and are called Elo'im. Then, by %0a%3c the power of this name, He brought them forth in perfection, defined as %0a%3c CALLS THEIR NAMES, which means that He called by name and brought %0a%3c forth every type and species to exist in perfection. Hence, it is said: HE %0a%3c BROUGHT FORTH THEIR HOST BY NUMBER— called them all by %0a%3c name, that is, by the name Elokim. %0a%3c %0a%3c It was already mentioned that the perfection of the Light, which is the %0a%3c Creator's name Elo-im, descends to the souls, generations, descendants, two %0a%3c degrees joined in one. This degree includes 600,000 from the Upper Degree, %0a%3c and innumerable hosts from the lower, and the Creator's name descends on %0a%3c both of them. %0a%3c %0a%3c The blessing of the seed depends entirely on MA, for it is determined by %0a%3c Ohr Hochma, as this Light designates perfection. Whereas the Light without %0a%3c a number, Ohr Hassadim, comes precisely from the name MA. As is already %0a%3c known, Ohr Hochma is accepted only when clothed in Ohr Hassadim. Until such %0a%3c clothing occurs, even though ELEH ascend to MI, the name Elokim (ELO-IM = %0a%3c ELEH + IM) does not act. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Mother Lends Her Clothes to Her Daughter %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 115 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, it is written that MI DOES NOT BEGET (ANY OFFSPRING), %0a%3c even though the point of Malchut left the thought (Bina) and descended back %0a%3c to her place, and all ten Sefirot and the Light returned to the Partzuf, THE %0a%3c NAME ELEH IS still CONCEALED, for she still cannot receive Hochma in the %0a%3c absence of Hassadim. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, BECAUSE HE CREATED ELEH, meaning that after He added a %0a%3c Zivug to the screen of MA (lower world, Malchut), there appeared Ohr Hassadim, %0a%3c called WITHOUT A NUMBER. And ELEH were filled with Ohr Hassadim, %0a%3c which means BARAH = CREATED ELEH, as clothing in Ohr Hassadim is called %0a%3c BARAH (creation). Only after this are they called ELOKIM, for only after the %0a%3c reception of Ohr Hassadim can they receive Ohr Hochma, called "the Light of a %0a%3c number," the Light of 600,000, as a result of which, the letters combine and %0a%3c form the complete name Elokim. %0a%3c %0a%3c The same perfection (clothing of Hochma in Hassadim) also extends to %0a%3c the souls and descendants that emerge from the name Elokim. AND HE IS %0a%3c CALLED BY THIS NAME: all that emerges is called by this name, with these %0a%3c properties He creates all descendants— Partzufim from His Zivug on Ohr Hochma. %0a%3c THE NAME 600,000 is Hochma, TOGETHER WITH HASSADIM, so that they %0a%3c will have the perfection of the name, so that Light will clothe Light, as they are %0a%3c clothed in the NAME. It is therefore written: SEE, I CALL THEM BY NAME, %0a%3c for "to call" means to revive and bring to perfection. %0a%3c %0a%3c 21. He asks, "What is the meaning of 'by the greatness of His might and %0a%3c wealth?'" This is the head of the degree, where all desires ascend and remain %0a%3c concealed. The strong one that ascended in the name Elokim, as it is said, %0a%3c "This is the secret of the Upper World, called MI." No man is missing from %0a%3c the 600,000 that He created by the power of this name. And because no one %0a%3c is missing from these 600,000, it follows that wherever the sons of Israel %0a%3c perished and were punished for their transgressions, we subsequently find %0a%3c that not one from the 600,000 had disappeared, so that everything would %0a%3c remain the same Above and below. And just as no one had disappeared from %0a%3c the 600,000 Above, no one has disappeared from this number below. %0a%3c %0a%3c FROM THE GREATNESS OF HIS MIGHT AND WEALTH signifies %0a%3c Keter de AVI, called the HEAD OF DEGREES. This is Bina of AA, which %0a%3c became Keter de Partzuf AVI, WHERE ALL DESIRES ASCEND (MAN of the %0a%3c lower ones), and receive all the degrees from there. This degree is filled with %0a%3c Ohr Hassadim, and exists in perfection even in the absence of Ohr Hochma, as its %0a%3c Light of Hassadim comes from GAR de BINA of AA. In other words, it has such %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 116 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c a powerful Light of Hassadim that although this degree emerged from Rosh de %0a%3c AA, it is not regarded as having left it, for it feels no need for Ohr Hochma. This %0a%3c degree, Keter of AVI, is the Rosh of all the degrees in the world of Atzilut, from %0a%3c where AVI, YESHSUT and ZON receive the Light. %0a%3c %0a%3c THE STRONG ONE IS THE SECRET OF THE UPPER WORLD, the %0a%3c property of MI that is present in Malchut, from where the number 600,000 %0a%3c descends, for she clothes the Upper World, AVI. Therefore, it is written that %0a%3c NO ONE DISAPPEARS FROM THOSE 600,000 because there Malchut %0a%3c receives Ohr Hochma, called "600,000 " Hence, it is said that AS NO ONE %0a%3c DISAPPEARED ABOVE, SO IT IS BELOW, for Malchut clothes AVI, described %0a%3c in the phrase: THE MOTHER ADORNS HER DAUGHTER WITH HER %0a%3c OWN ADORNMENTS, by which Malchut becomes completely similar to AVI. %0a%3c And just as the Light of AVI is perfect (which is why it is called "600,000" and %0a%3c NO ONE HAS DISAPPEARED, i.e., no lack of Ohr Hochma is felt), Malchut is %0a%3c perfect in this number, which means NO ONE HAS DISAPPEARED below. %0a\ No newline at end of file%0a
