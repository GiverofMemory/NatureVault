And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom and%0aRaamses.%0a%0a1:12 But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and%0agrew.%0a%0aAnd they were grieved because of the children of Israel.%0a%0a1:13 And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with%0arigour: 1:14 And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in%0amorter, and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all%0atheir service, wherein they made them serve, was with rigour.%0a%0a1:15 And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of which the%0aname of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah: 1:16 And%0ahe said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and%0asee them upon the stools; if it be a son, then ye shall kill him: but%0aif it be a daughter, then she shall live.%0a%0a1:17 But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt%0acommanded them, but saved the men children alive.%0a%0a1:18 And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto%0athem, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men children%0aalive?  1:19 And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew%0awomen are not as the Egyptian women; for they are lively, and are%0adelivered ere the midwives come in unto them.%0a%0a1:20 Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people%0amultiplied, and waxed very mighty.%0a%0a1:21 And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he%0amade them houses.%0a%0a1:22 And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is%0aborn ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save%0aalive.%0a%0a2:1 And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took to wife a%0adaughter of Levi.%0a%0a2:2 And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she saw him that%0ahe was a goodly child, she hid him three months.%0a%0a2:3 And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of%0abulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the child%0atherein; and she laid it in the flags by the river's brink.%0a%0a2:4 And his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to him.%0a%0a2:5 And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself at the%0ariver; and her maidens walked along by the river's side; and when she%0asaw the ark among the flags, she sent her maid to fetch it.%0a%0a2:6 And when she had opened it, she saw the child: and, behold, the%0ababe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of the%0aHebrews' children.%0a%0a2:7 Then said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and call to%0athee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for%0athee?  2:8 And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went%0aand called the child's mother.%0a%0a2:9 And Pharaoh's daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and%0anurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages. And the women took%0athe child, and nursed it.%0a%0a2:10 And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh's daughter,%0aand he became her son. And she called his name Moses: and she said,%0aBecause I drew him out of the water.%0a%0a2:11 And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he%0awent out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he spied%0aan Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his brethren.%0a%0a2:12 And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there%0awas no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.%0a%0a2:13 And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the%0aHebrews strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong,%0aWherefore smitest thou thy fellow?  2:14 And he said, Who made thee a%0aprince and a judge over us? intendest thou to kill me, as thou%0akilledst the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely this thing%0ais known.%0a%0a2:15 Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But%0aMoses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian:%0aand he sat down by a well.%0a%0a2:16 Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and%0adrew water, and filled the troughs to water their father's flock.%0a%0a2:17 And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood up%0aand helped them, and watered their flock.%0a%0a2:18 And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How is it that%0aye are come so soon to day?  2:19 And they said, An Egyptian delivered%0aus out of the hand of the shepherds, and also drew water enough for%0aus, and watered the flock.%0a%0a2:20 And he said unto his daughters, And where is he? why is it that%0aye have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread.%0a%0a2:21 And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses%0aZipporah his daughter.%0a%0a2:22 And she bare him a son, and he called his name Gershom: for he%0asaid, I have been a stranger in a strange land.%0a%0a2:23 And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egypt%0adied: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and%0athey cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage.%0a%0a2:24 And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant%0awith Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.%0a%0a2:25 And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God had respect%0aunto them.%0a%0a3:1 Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father in law, the priest%0aof Midian: and he led the flock to the backside of the desert, and%0acame to the mountain of God, even to Horeb.%0a%0a3:2 And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him in a flame of fire out%0aof the midst of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned%0awith fire, and the bush was not consumed.%0a%0a3:3 And Moses said, I will now turn aside, and see this great sight,%0awhy the bush is not burnt.%0a%0a3:4 And when the LORD saw that he turned aside to see, God called unto%0ahim out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And he said,%0aHere am I.%0a%0a3:5 And he said, Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off thy%0afeet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.%0a%0a3:6 Moreover he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham,%0athe God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for he%0awas afraid to look upon God.%0a%0a3:7 And the LORD said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people%0awhich are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their%0ataskmasters; for I know their sorrows; 3:8 And I am come down to%0adeliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up%0aout of that land unto a good land and a large, unto a land flowing%0awith milk and honey; unto the place of the Canaanites, and the%0aHittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and%0athe Jebusites.%0a%0a3:9 Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come%0aunto me: and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians%0aoppress them.%0a%0a3:10 Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou%0amayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt.%0a%0a3:11 And Moses said unto God, Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh,%0aand that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?%0a3:12 And he said, Certainly I will be with thee; and this shall be a%0atoken unto thee, that I have sent thee: When thou hast brought forth%0athe people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain.%0a%0a3:13 And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children of%0aIsrael, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me%0aunto you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? what shall I say%0aunto them?  3:14 And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said,%0aThus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me%0aunto you.%0a%0a3:15 And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the%0achildren of Israel, the LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham,%0athe God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you: this is%0amy name for ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations.%0a%0a3:16 Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto them,%0aThe LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of%0aJacob, appeared unto me, saying, I have surely visited you, and seen%0athat which is done to you in Egypt: 3:17 And I have said, I will bring%0ayou up out of the affliction of Egypt unto the land of the Canaanites,%0aand the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the%0aHivites, and the Jebusites, unto a land flowing with milk and honey.%0a%0a3:18 And they shall hearken to thy voice: and thou shalt come, thou%0aand the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt, and ye shall say%0aunto him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath met with us: and now let us%0ago, we beseech thee, three days' journey into the wilderness, that we%0amay sacrifice to the LORD our God.%0a%0a3:19 And I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go, no, not%0aby a mighty hand.%0a%0a3:20 And I will stretch out my hand, and smite Egypt with all my%0awonders which I will do in the midst thereof: and after that he will%0alet you go.%0a%0a3:21 And I will give this people favour in the sight of the Egyptians:%0aand it shall come to pass, that, when ye go, ye shall not go empty.%0a%0a3:22 But every woman shall borrow of her neighbour, and of her that%0asojourneth in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and%0araiment: and ye shall put them upon your sons, and upon your%0adaughters; and ye shall spoil the Egyptians.%0a%0a4:1 And Moses answered and said, But, behold, they will not believe%0ame, nor hearken unto my voice: for they will say, The LORD hath not%0aappeared unto thee.%0a%0a4:2 And the LORD said unto him, What is that in thine hand? And he%0asaid, A rod.%0a%0a4:3 And he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the ground,%0aand it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before it.%0a%0a4:4 And the LORD said unto Moses, Put forth thine hand, and take it by%0athe tail. And he put forth his hand, and caught it, and it became a%0arod in his hand: 4:5 That they may believe that the LORD God of their%0afathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob,%0ahath appeared unto thee.%0a%0a4:6 And the LORD said furthermore unto him, Put now thine hand into%0athy bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom: and when he took it%0aout, behold, his hand was leprous as snow.%0a%0a4:7 And he said, Put thine hand into thy bosom again. And he put his%0ahand into his bosom again; and plucked it out of his bosom, and,%0abehold, it was turned again as his other flesh.%0a%0a4:8 And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee, neither%0ahearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the%0avoice of the latter sign.%0a%0a4:9 And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe also these two%0asigns, neither hearken unto thy voice, that thou shalt take of the%0awater of the river, and pour it upon the dry land: and the water which%0athou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land.%0a%0a4:10 And Moses said unto the LORD, O my LORD, I am not eloquent,%0aneither heretofore, nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant: but I%0aam slow of speech, and of a slow tongue.%0a%0a4:11 And the LORD said unto him, Who hath made man's mouth? or who%0amaketh the dumb, or deaf, or the seeing, or the blind? have not I the%0aLORD?  4:12 Now therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach%0athee what thou shalt say.%0a%0a4:13 And he said, O my LORD, send, I pray thee, by the hand of him%0awhom thou wilt send.%0a%0a4:14 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Moses, and he said,%0aIs not Aaron the Levite thy brother?

ye shall not diminish ought thereof: for they be%0aidle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and sacrifice to our God.%0a%0a5:9 Let there more work be laid upon the men, that they may labour%0atherein; and let them not regard vain words.%0a%0a5:10 And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers,%0aand they spake to the people, saying, Thus saith Pharaoh, I will not%0agive you straw.%0a%0a5:11 Go ye, get you straw where ye can find it: yet not ought of your%0awork shall be diminished.%0a%0a5:12 So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of%0aEgypt to gather stubble instead of straw.%0a%0a5:13 And the taskmasters hasted them, saying, Fulfil your works, your%0adaily tasks, as when there was straw.%0a%0a5:14 And the officers of the children of Israel, which Pharaoh's%0ataskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and demanded, Wherefore%0ahave ye not fulfilled your task in making brick both yesterday and to%0aday, as heretofore?  5:15 Then the officers of the children of Israel%0acame and cried unto Pharaoh, saying, Wherefore dealest thou thus with%0athy servants?  5:16 There is no straw given unto thy servants, and%0athey say to us, Make brick: and, behold, thy servants are beaten;

neither hast thou delivered thy people at all.%0a%0a6:1 Then the LORD said unto Moses, Now shalt thou see what I will do%0ato Pharaoh: for with a strong hand shall he let them go, and with a%0astrong hand shall he drive them out of his land.%0a%0a6:2 And God spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I am the LORD: 6:3%0aAnd I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by the name%0aof God Almighty, but by my name JEHOVAH was I not known to them.%0a%0a6:4 And I have also established my covenant with them, to give them%0athe land of Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage, wherein they were%0astrangers.%0a%0a6:5 And I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom%0athe Egyptians keep in bondage;

and the%0afrogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt.%0a%0a8:7 And the magicians did so with their enchantments, and brought up%0afrogs upon the land of Egypt.%0a%0a8:8 Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, Intreat the%0aLORD, that he may take away the frogs from me, and from my people; and%0aI will let the people go, that they may do sacrifice unto the LORD.%0a%0a8:9 And Moses said unto Pharaoh, Glory over me: when shall I intreat%0afor thee, and for thy servants, and for thy people, to destroy the%0afrogs from thee and thy houses, that they may remain in the river%0aonly?  8:10 And he said, To morrow. And he said, Be it according to%0athy word: that thou mayest know that there is none like unto the LORD%0aour God.%0a%0a8:11 And the frogs shall depart from thee, and from thy houses, and%0afrom thy servants, and from thy people; they shall remain in the river%0aonly.%0a%0a8:12 And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh: and Moses cried unto%0athe LORD because of the frogs which he had brought against Pharaoh.%0a%0a8:13 And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and the frogs%0adied out of the houses, out of the villages, and out of the fields.%0a%0a8:14 And they gathered them together upon heaps: and the land stank.%0a%0a8:15 But when Pharaoh saw that there was respite, he hardened his%0aheart, and hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said.%0a%0a8:16 And the LORD said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch out thy%0arod, and smite the dust of the land, that it may become lice%0athroughout all the land of Egypt.%0a%0a8:17 And they did so; for Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod,%0aand smote the dust of the earth, and it became lice in man, and in%0abeast; all the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of%0aEgypt.%0a%0a8:18 And the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth%0alice, but they could not: so there were lice upon man, and upon beast.%0a%0a8:19 Then the magicians said unto Pharaoh, This is the finger of God:%0aand Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he hearkened not unto them; as%0athe LORD had said.%0a%0a8:20 And the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and%0astand before Pharaoh; lo, he cometh forth to the water; and say unto%0ahim, Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me.%0a%0a8:21 Else, if thou wilt not let my people go, behold, I will send%0aswarms of flies upon thee, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people,%0aand into thy houses: and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of%0aswarms of flies, and also the ground whereon they are.%0a%0a8:22 And I will sever in that day the land of Goshen, in which my%0apeople dwell, that no swarms of flies shall be there; to the end thou%0amayest know that I am the LORD in the midst of the earth.%0a%0a8:23 And I will put a division between my people and thy people: to%0amorrow shall this sign be.%0a%0a8:24 And the LORD did so; and there came a grievous swarm of flies%0ainto the house of Pharaoh, and into his servants' houses, and into all%0athe land of Egypt: the land was corrupted by reason of the swarm of%0aflies.%0a%0a8:25 And Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and said, Go ye,%0asacrifice to your God in the land.%0a%0a8:26 And Moses said, It is not meet so to do; for we shall sacrifice%0athe abomination of the Egyptians to the LORD our God: lo, shall we%0asacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, and will%0athey not stone us?  8:27 We will go three days' journey into the%0awilderness, and sacrifice to the LORD our God, as he shall command us.%0a%0a8:28 And Pharaoh said, I will let you go, that ye may sacrifice to the%0aLORD your God in the wilderness; only ye shall not go very far away:%0aintreat for me.%0a%0a8:29 And Moses said, Behold, I go out from thee, and I will intreat%0athe LORD that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh, from his%0aservants, and from his people, to morrow: but let not Pharaoh deal%0adeceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the%0aLORD.%0a%0a8:30 And Moses went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the LORD.%0a%0a8:31 And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and he removed%0athe swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his%0apeople; there remained not one.%0a%0a8:32 And Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also, neither would%0ahe let the people go.%0a%0a9:1 Then the LORD said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh, and tell him,%0aThus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they%0amay serve me.%0a%0a9:2 For if thou refuse to let them go, and wilt hold them still, 9:3%0aBehold, the hand of the LORD is upon thy cattle which is in the field,%0aupon the horses, upon the asses, upon the camels, upon the oxen, and%0aupon the sheep: there shall be a very grievous murrain.%0a%0a9:4 And the LORD shall sever between the cattle of Israel and the%0acattle of Egypt: and there shall nothing die of all that is the%0achildren's of Israel.%0a%0a9:5 And the LORD appointed a set time, saying, To morrow the LORD%0ashall do this thing in the land.%0a%0a9:6 And the LORD did that thing on the morrow, and all the cattle of%0aEgypt died: but of the cattle of the children of Israel died not one.%0a%0a9:7 And Pharaoh sent, and, behold, there was not one of the cattle of%0athe Israelites dead. And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did%0anot let the people go.%0a%0a9:8 And the LORD said unto Moses and unto Aaron, Take to you handfuls%0aof ashes of the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it toward the heaven%0ain the sight of Pharaoh.%0a%0a9:9 And it shall become small dust in all the land of Egypt, and shall%0abe a boil breaking forth with blains upon man, and upon beast,%0athroughout all the land of Egypt.%0a%0a9:10 And they took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh; and%0aMoses sprinkled it up toward heaven; and it became a boil breaking%0aforth with blains upon man, and upon beast.%0a%0a9:11 And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the%0aboils; for the boil was upon the magicians, and upon all the%0aEgyptians.%0a%0a9:12 And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he hearkened not%0aunto them; as the LORD had spoken unto Moses.%0a%0a9:13 And the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and%0astand before Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of the%0aHebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me.%0a%0a9:14 For I will at this time send all my plagues upon thine heart, and%0aupon thy servants, and upon thy people; that thou mayest know that%0athere is none like me in all the earth.%0a%0a9:15 For now I will stretch out my hand, that I may smite thee and thy%0apeople with pestilence; and thou shalt be cut off from the earth.%0a%0a9:16 And in very deed for this cause have I raised thee up, for to%0ashew in thee my power; and that my name may be declared throughout all%0athe earth.%0a%0a9:17 As yet exaltest thou thyself against my people, that thou wilt%0anot let them go?  9:18 Behold, to morrow about this time I will cause%0ait to rain a very grievous hail, such as hath not been in Egypt since%0athe foundation thereof even until now.%0a%0a9:19 Send therefore now, and gather thy cattle, and all that thou hast%0ain the field; for upon every man and beast which shall be found in the%0afield, and shall not be brought home, the hail shall come down upon%0athem, and they shall die.%0a%0a9:20 He that feared the word of the LORD among the servants of Pharaoh%0amade his servants and his cattle flee into the houses: 9:21 And he%0athat regarded not the word of the LORD left his servants and his%0acattle in the field.%0a%0a9:22 And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch forth thine hand toward%0aheaven, that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, upon man, and%0aupon beast, and upon every herb of the field, throughout the land of%0aEgypt.%0a%0a9:23 And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven: and the LORD%0asent thunder and hail, and the fire ran along upon the ground; and the%0aLORD rained hail upon the land of Egypt.%0a%0a9:24 So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous,%0asuch as there was none like it in all the land of Egypt since it%0abecame a nation.%0a%0a9:25 And the hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all that was%0ain the field, both man and beast; and the hail smote every herb of the%0afield, and brake every tree of the field.%0a%0a9:26 Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel were,%0awas there no hail.%0a%0a9:27 And Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said unto%0athem, I have sinned this time: the LORD is righteous, and I and my%0apeople are wicked.%0a%0a9:28 Intreat the LORD (for it is enough) that there be no more mighty%0athunderings and hail; and I will let you go, and ye shall stay no%0alonger.%0a%0a9:29 And Moses said unto him, As soon as I am gone out of the city, I%0awill spread abroad my hands unto the LORD; and the thunder shall%0acease, neither shall there be any more hail; that thou mayest know how%0athat the earth is the LORD's.%0a%0a9:30 But as for thee and thy servants, I know that ye will not yet%0afear the LORD God.%0a%0a9:31 And the flax and the barley was smitten: for the barley was in%0athe ear, and the flax was bolled.%0a%0a9:32 But the wheat and the rie were not smitten: for they were not%0agrown up.%0a%0a9:33 And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroad%0ahis hands unto the LORD: and the thunders and hail ceased, and the%0arain was not poured upon the earth.%0a%0a9:34 And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders%0awere ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and his%0aservants.%0a%0a9:35 And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, neither would he let the%0achildren of Israel go; as the LORD had spoken by Moses.%0a%0a10:1 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh: for I have%0ahardened his heart, and the heart of his servants, that I might shew%0athese my signs before him: 10:2 And that thou mayest tell in the ears%0aof thy son, and of thy son's son, what things I have wrought in Egypt,%0aand my signs which I have done among them; that ye may know how that I%0aam the LORD.%0a%0a10:3 And Moses and Aaron came in unto Pharaoh, and said unto him, Thus%0asaith the LORD God of the Hebrews, How long wilt thou refuse to humble%0athyself before me? let my people go, that they may serve me.%0a%0a10:4 Else, if thou refuse to let my people go, behold, to morrow will%0aI bring the locusts into thy coast: 10:5 And they shall cover the face%0aof the earth, that one cannot be able to see the earth: and they shall%0aeat the residue of that which is escaped, which remaineth unto you%0afrom the hail, and shall eat every tree which groweth for you out of%0athe field: 10:6 And they shall fill thy houses, and the houses of all%0athy servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians; which neither thy%0afathers, nor thy fathers' fathers have seen, since the day that they%0awere upon the earth unto this day. And he turned himself, and went out%0afrom Pharaoh.%0a%0a10:7 And Pharaoh's servants said unto him, How long shall this man be%0aa snare unto us? let the men go, that they may serve the LORD their%0aGod: knowest thou not yet that Egypt is destroyed?  10:8 And Moses and%0aAaron were brought again unto Pharaoh: and he said unto them, Go,%0aserve the LORD your God: but who are they that shall go?  10:9 And%0aMoses said, We will go with our young and with our old, with our sons%0aand with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds will we go;%0afor we must hold a feast unto the LORD.%0a%0a10:10 And he said unto them, Let the LORD be so with you, as I will%0alet you go, and your little ones: look to it; for evil is before you.%0a%0a10:11 Not so: go now ye that are men, and serve the LORD; for that ye%0adid desire. And they were driven out from Pharaoh's presence.%0a%0a10:12 And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the%0aland of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up upon the land of%0aEgypt, and eat every herb of the land, even all that the hail hath%0aleft.%0a%0a10:13 And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and%0athe LORD brought an east wind upon the land all that day, and all that%0anight; and when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts.%0a%0a10:14 And the locust went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in%0aall the coasts of Egypt: very grievous were they; before them there%0awere no such locusts as they, neither after them shall be such.%0a%0a10:15 For they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land%0awas darkened; and they did eat every herb of the land, and all the%0afruit of the trees which the hail had left: and there remained not any%0agreen thing in the trees, or in the herbs of the field, through all%0athe land of Egypt.%0a%0a10:16 Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste; and he said, I%0ahave sinned against the LORD your God, and against you.%0a%0a10:17 Now therefore forgive, I pray thee, my sin only this once, and%0aintreat the LORD your God, that he may take away from me this death%0aonly.%0a%0a10:18 And he went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the LORD.%0a%0a10:19 And the LORD turned a mighty strong west wind, which took away%0athe locusts, and cast them into the Red sea; there remained not one%0alocust in all the coasts of Egypt.%0a%0a10:20 But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not let%0athe children of Israel go.%0a%0a10:21 And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand toward%0aheaven, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even%0adarkness which may be felt.%0a%0a10:22 And Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven; and there was%0aa thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days: 10:23 They saw%0anot one another, neither rose any from his place for three days: but%0aall the children of Israel had light in their dwellings.%0a%0a10:24 And Pharaoh called unto Moses, and said, Go ye, serve the LORD;%0aonly let your flocks and your herds be stayed: let your little ones%0aalso go with you.%0a%0a10:25 And Moses said, Thou must give us also sacrifices and burnt%0aofferings, that we may sacrifice unto the LORD our God.%0a%0a10:26 Our cattle also shall go with us; there shall not an hoof be%0aleft behind; for thereof must we take to serve the LORD our God; and%0awe know not with what we must serve the LORD, until we come thither.%0a%0a10:27 But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he would not let them%0ago.%0a%0a10:28 And Pharaoh said unto him, Get thee from me, take heed to%0athyself, see my face no more; for in that day thou seest my face thou%0ashalt die.%0a%0a10:29 And Moses said, Thou hast spoken well, I will see thy face again%0ano more.%0a%0a11:1 And the LORD said unto Moses, Yet will I bring one plague more%0aupon Pharaoh, and upon Egypt; afterwards he will let you go hence:%0awhen he shall let you go, he shall surely thrust you out hence%0aaltogether.%0a%0a11:2 Speak now in the ears of the people, and let every man borrow of%0ahis neighbour, and every woman of her neighbour, jewels of silver and%0ajewels of gold.%0a%0a11:3 And the LORD gave the people favour in the sight of the%0aEgyptians.%0a%0aMoreover the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, in the%0asight of Pharaoh's servants, and in the sight of the people.%0a%0a11:4 And Moses said, Thus saith the LORD, About midnight will I go out%0ainto the midst of Egypt: 11:5 And all the firstborn in the land of%0aEgypt shall die, from the first born of Pharaoh that sitteth upon his%0athrone, even unto the firstborn of the maidservant that is behind the%0amill; and all the firstborn of beasts.%0a%0a11:6 And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt,%0asuch as there was none like it, nor shall be like it any more.%0a%0a11:7 But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move%0ahis tongue, against man or beast: that ye may know how that the LORD%0adoth put a difference between the Egyptians and Israel.%0a%0a11:8 And all these thy servants shall come down unto me, and bow down%0athemselves unto me, saying, Get thee out, and all the people that%0afollow thee: and after that I will go out. And he went out from%0aPharaoh in a great anger.%0a%0a11:9 And the LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you;%0athat my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt.%0a%0a11:10 And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh: and%0athe LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not let the%0achildren of Israel go out of his land.%0a%0a12:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt%0asaying, 12:2 This month shall be unto you the beginning of months: it%0ashall be the first month of the year to you.%0a%0a12:3 Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the%0atenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb,%0aaccording to the house of their fathers, a lamb for an house: 12:4 And%0aif the household be too little for the lamb, let him and his neighbour%0anext unto his house take it according to the number of the souls;%0aevery man according to his eating shall make your count for the lamb.%0a%0a12:5 Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year: ye%0ashall take it out from the sheep, or from the goats: 12:6 And ye shall%0akeep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month: and the whole%0aassembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening.%0a%0a12:7 And they shall take of the blood, and strike it on the two side%0aposts and on the upper door post of the houses, wherein they shall eat%0ait.%0a%0a12:8 And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire, and%0aunleavened bread; and with bitter herbs they shall eat it.%0a%0a12:9 Eat not of it raw, nor sodden at all with water, but roast with%0afire; his head with his legs, and with the purtenance thereof.%0a%0a12:10 And ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning; and%0athat which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire.%0a%0a12:11 And thus shall ye eat it; with your loins girded, your shoes on%0ayour feet, and your staff in your hand; and ye shall eat it in haste:%0ait is the LORD's passover.%0a%0a12:12 For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night, and will%0asmite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and%0aagainst all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment: I am the LORD.%0a%0a12:13 And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where%0aye are: and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and the plague%0ashall not be upon you to destroy you, when I smite the land of Egypt.%0a%0a12:14 And this day shall be unto you for a memorial; and ye shall keep%0ait a feast to the LORD throughout your generations; ye shall keep it a%0afeast by an ordinance for ever.%0a%0a12:15 Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread; even the first day ye%0ashall put away leaven out of your houses: for whosoever eateth%0aleavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that soul%0ashall be cut off from Israel.%0a%0a12:16 And in the first day there shall be an holy convocation, and in%0athe seventh day there shall be an holy convocation to you; no manner%0aof work shall be done in them, save that which every man must eat,%0athat only may be done of you.%0a%0a12:17 And ye shall observe the feast of unleavened bread; for in this%0aselfsame day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt:%0atherefore shall ye observe this day in your generations by an%0aordinance for ever.%0a%0a12:18 In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at even,%0aye shall eat unleavened bread, until the one and twentieth day of the%0amonth at even.%0a%0a12:19 Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses: for%0awhosoever eateth that which is leavened, even that soul shall be cut%0aoff from the congregation of Israel, whether he be a stranger, or born%0ain the land.%0a%0a12:20 Ye shall eat nothing leavened; in all your habitations shall ye%0aeat unleavened bread.%0a%0a12:21 Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said unto%0athem, Draw out and take you a lamb according to your families, and%0akill the passover.%0a%0a12:22 And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood%0athat is in the bason, and strike the lintel and the two side posts%0awith the blood that is in the bason; and none of you shall go out at%0athe door of his house until the morning.%0a%0a12:23 For the LORD will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when%0ahe seeth the blood upon the lintel, and on the two side posts, the%0aLORD will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to%0acome in unto your houses to smite you.%0a%0a12:24 And ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to%0athy sons for ever.%0a%0a12:25 And it shall come to pass, when ye be come to the land which the%0aLORD will give you, according as he hath promised, that ye shall keep%0athis service.%0a%0a12:26 And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say unto%0ayou, What mean ye by this service?  12:27 That ye shall say, It is the%0asacrifice of the LORD's passover, who passed over the houses of the%0achildren of Israel in Egypt, when he smote the Egyptians, and%0adelivered our houses. And the people bowed the head and worshipped.%0a%0a12:28 And the children of Israel went away, and did as the LORD had%0acommanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.%0a%0a12:29 And it came to pass, that at midnight the LORD smote all the%0afirstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sat%0aon his throne unto the firstborn of the captive that was in the%0adungeon; and all the firstborn of cattle.%0a%0a12:30 And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and%0aall the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt; for there was%0anot a house where there was not one dead.%0a%0a12:31 And he called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Rise up,%0aand get you forth from among my people, both ye and the children of%0aIsrael; and go, serve the LORD, as ye have said.%0a%0a12:32 Also take your flocks and your herds, as ye have said, and be%0agone; and bless me also.%0a%0a12:33 And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, that they might%0asend them out of the land in haste; for they said, We be all dead men.%0a%0a12:34 And the people took their dough before it was leavened, their%0akneadingtroughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders.%0a%0a12:35 And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses;%0aand they borrowed of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of%0agold, and raiment: 12:36 And the LORD gave the people favour in the%0asight of the Egyptians, so that they lent unto them such things as%0athey required. And they spoiled the Egyptians.%0a%0a12:37 And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth,%0aabout six hundred thousand on foot that were men, beside children.%0a%0a12:38 And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and%0aherds, even very much cattle.%0a%0a12:39 And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought%0aforth out of Egypt, for it was not leavened; because they were thrust%0aout of Egypt, and could not tarry, neither had they prepared for%0athemselves any victual.%0a%0a12:40 Now the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelt in%0aEgypt, was four hundred and thirty years.%0a%0a12:41 And it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty%0ayears, even the selfsame day it came to pass, that all the hosts of%0athe LORD went out from the land of Egypt.%0a%0a12:42 It is a night to be much observed unto the LORD for bringing%0athem out from the land of Egypt: this is that night of the LORD to be%0aobserved of all the children of Israel in their generations.%0a%0a12:43 And the LORD said unto Moses and Aaron, This is the ordinance of%0athe passover: There shall no stranger eat thereof: 12:44 But every%0aman's servant that is bought for money, when thou hast circumcised%0ahim, then shall he eat thereof.%0a%0a12:45 A foreigner and an hired servant shall not eat thereof.%0a%0a12:46 In one house shall it be eaten; thou shalt not carry forth ought%0aof the flesh abroad out of the house; neither shall ye break a bone%0athereof.%0a%0a12:47 All the congregation of Israel shall keep it.%0a%0a12:48 And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee, and will keep the%0apassover to the LORD, let all his males be circumcised, and then let%0ahim come near and keep it; and he shall be as one that is born in the%0aland: for no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof.%0a%0a12:49 One law shall be to him that is homeborn, and unto the stranger%0athat sojourneth among you.%0a%0a12:50 Thus did all the children of Israel; as the LORD commanded Moses%0aand Aaron, so did they.%0a%0a12:51 And it came to pass the selfsame day, that the LORD did bring%0athe children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies.%0a%0a13:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 13:2 Sanctify unto me all%0athe firstborn, whatsoever openeth the womb among the children of%0aIsrael, both of man and of beast: it is mine.%0a%0a13:3 And Moses said unto the people, Remember this day, in which ye%0acame out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by strength of%0ahand the LORD brought you out from this place: there shall no leavened%0abread be eaten.%0a%0a13:4 This day came ye out in the month Abib.%0a%0a13:5 And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land of%0athe Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Hivites,%0aand the Jebusites, which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee, a%0aland flowing with milk and honey, that thou shalt keep this service in%0athis month.%0a%0a13:6 Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, and in the seventh%0aday shall be a feast to the LORD.%0a%0a13:7 Unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days; and there shall no%0aleavened bread be seen with thee, neither shall there be leaven seen%0awith thee in all thy quarters.%0a%0a13:8 And thou shalt shew thy son in that day, saying, This is done%0abecause of that which the LORD did unto me when I came forth out of%0aEgypt.%0a%0a13:9 And it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thine hand, and for a%0amemorial between thine eyes, that the LORD's law may be in thy mouth:%0afor with a strong hand hath the LORD brought thee out of Egypt.%0a%0a13:10 Thou shalt therefore keep this ordinance in his season from year%0ato year.%0a%0a13:11 And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land of%0athe Canaanites, as he sware unto thee and to thy fathers, and shall%0agive it thee, 13:12 That thou shalt set apart unto the LORD all that%0aopeneth the matrix, and every firstling that cometh of a beast which%0athou hast; the males shall be the LORD's.%0a%0a13:13 And every firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb; and%0aif thou wilt not redeem it, then thou shalt break his neck: and all%0athe firstborn of man among thy children shalt thou redeem.%0a%0a13:14 And it shall be when thy son asketh thee in time to come,%0asaying, What is this? that thou shalt say unto him, By strength of%0ahand the LORD brought us out from Egypt, from the house of bondage:%0a13:15 And it came to pass, when Pharaoh would hardly let us go, that%0athe LORD slew all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the%0afirstborn of man, and the firstborn of beast: therefore I sacrifice to%0athe LORD all that openeth the matrix, being males; but all the%0afirstborn of my children I redeem.%0a%0a13:16 And it shall be for a token upon thine hand, and for frontlets%0abetween thine eyes: for by strength of hand the LORD brought us forth%0aout of Egypt.%0a%0a13:17 And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that%0aGod led them not through the way of the land of the Philistines,%0aalthough that was near; for God said, Lest peradventure the people%0arepent when they see war, and they return to Egypt: 13:18 But God led%0athe people about, through the way of the wilderness of the Red sea:%0aand the children of Israel went up harnessed out of the land of Egypt.%0a%0a13:19 And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him: for he had straitly%0asworn the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you; and%0aye shall carry up my bones away hence with you.%0a%0a13:20 And they took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in Etham,%0ain the edge of the wilderness.%0a%0a13:21 And the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, to%0alead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them%0alight; to go by day and night: 13:22 He took not away the pillar of%0athe cloud by day, nor the pillar of fire by night, from before the%0apeople.%0a%0a14:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 14:2 Speak unto the%0achildren of Israel, that they turn and encamp before Pihahiroth,%0abetween Migdol and the sea, over against Baalzephon: before it shall%0aye encamp by the sea.%0a%0a14:3 For Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, They are%0aentangled in the land, the wilderness hath shut them in.%0a%0a14:4 And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, that he shall follow after%0athem; and I will be honoured upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host; that%0athe Egyptians may know that I am the LORD. And they did so.%0a%0a14:5 And it was told the king of Egypt that the people fled: and the%0aheart of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people,%0aand they said, Why have we done this, that we have let Israel go from%0aserving us?  14:6 And he made ready his chariot, and took his people%0awith him: 14:7 And he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the%0achariots of Egypt, and captains over every one of them.%0a%0a14:8 And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he%0apursued after the children of Israel: and the children of Israel went%0aout with an high hand.%0a%0a14:9 But the Egyptians pursued after them, all the horses and chariots%0aof Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army, and overtook them%0aencamping by the sea, beside Pihahiroth, before Baalzephon.%0a%0a14:10 And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted up%0atheir eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians marched after them; and they%0awere sore afraid: and the children of Israel cried out unto the LORD.%0a%0a14:11 And they said unto Moses, Because there were no graves in Egypt,%0ahast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness? wherefore hast thou%0adealt thus with us, to carry us forth out of Egypt?  14:12 Is not this%0athe word that we did tell thee in Egypt, saying, Let us alone, that we%0amay serve the Egyptians? For it had been better for us to serve the%0aEgyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness.%0a%0a14:13 And Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not, stand still, and%0asee the salvation of the LORD, which he will shew to you to day: for%0athe Egyptians whom ye have seen to day, ye shall see them again no%0amore for ever.%0a%0a14:14 The LORD shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace.%0a%0a14:15 And the LORD said unto Moses, Wherefore criest thou unto me?%0aspeak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward: 14:16 But%0alift thou up thy rod, and stretch out thine hand over the sea, and%0adivide it: and the children of Israel shall go on dry ground through%0athe midst of the sea.%0a%0a14:17 And I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and%0athey shall follow them: and I will get me honour upon Pharaoh, and%0aupon all his host, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen.%0a%0a14:18 And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I have%0agotten me honour upon Pharaoh, upon his chariots, and upon his%0ahorsemen.%0a%0a14:19 And the angel of God, which went before the camp of Israel,%0aremoved and went behind them; and the pillar of the cloud went from%0abefore their face, and stood behind them: 14:20 And it came between%0athe camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel; and it was a cloud%0aand darkness to them, but it gave light by night to these: so that the%0aone came not near the other all the night.%0a%0a14:21 And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the LORD%0acaused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night, and%0amade the sea dry land, and the waters were divided.%0a%0a14:22 And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon%0athe dry ground: and the waters were a wall unto them on their right%0ahand, and on their left.%0a%0a14:23 And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them to the midst%0aof the sea, even all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen.%0a%0a14:24 And it came to pass, that in the morning watch the LORD looked%0aunto the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the%0acloud, and troubled the host of the Egyptians, 14:25 And took off%0atheir chariot wheels, that they drave them heavily: so that the%0aEgyptians said, Let us flee from the face of Israel; for the LORD%0afighteth for them against the Egyptians.%0a%0a14:26 And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the%0asea, that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians, upon their%0achariots, and upon their horsemen.%0a%0a14:27 And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea%0areturned to his strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians%0afled against it; and the LORD overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of%0athe sea.%0a%0a14:28 And the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the%0ahorsemen, and all the host of Pharaoh that came into the sea after%0athem; there remained not so much as one of them.%0a%0a14:29 But the children of Israel walked upon dry land in the midst of%0athe sea; and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and%0aon their left.%0a%0a14:30 Thus the LORD saved Israel that day out of the hand of the%0aEgyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea shore.%0a%0a14:31 And Israel saw that great work which the LORD did upon the%0aEgyptians: and the people feared the LORD, and believed the LORD, and%0ahis servant Moses.%0a%0a15:1 Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the%0aLORD, and spake, saying, I will sing unto the LORD, for he hath%0atriumphed gloriously: the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the%0asea.%0a%0a15:2 The LORD is my strength and song, and he is become my salvation:%0ahe is my God, and I will prepare him an habitation; my father's God,%0aand I will exalt him.%0a%0a15:3 The LORD is a man of war: the LORD is his name.%0a%0a15:4 Pharaoh's chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea: his%0achosen captains also are drowned in the Red sea.%0a%0a15:5 The depths have covered them: they sank into the bottom as a%0astone.%0a%0a15:6 Thy right hand, O LORD, is become glorious in power: thy right%0ahand, O LORD, hath dashed in pieces the enemy.%0a%0a15:7 And in the greatness of thine excellency thou hast overthrown%0athem that rose up against thee: thou sentest forth thy wrath, which%0aconsumed them as stubble.%0a%0a15:8 And with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were gathered%0atogether, the floods stood upright as an heap, and the depths were%0acongealed in the heart of the sea.%0a%0a15:9 The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the%0aspoil; my lust shall be satisfied upon them; I will draw my sword, my%0ahand shall destroy them.%0a%0a15:10 Thou didst blow with thy wind, the sea covered them: they sank%0aas lead in the mighty waters.%0a%0a15:11 Who is like unto thee, O LORD, among the gods? who is like thee,%0aglorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders?  15:12 Thou%0astretchedst out thy right hand, the earth swallowed them.%0a%0a15:13 Thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people which thou hast%0aredeemed: thou hast guided them in thy strength unto thy holy%0ahabitation.%0a%0a15:14 The people shall hear, and be afraid: sorrow shall take hold on%0athe inhabitants of Palestina.%0a%0a15:15 Then the dukes of Edom shall be amazed; the mighty men of Moab,%0atrembling shall take hold upon them; all the inhabitants of Canaan%0ashall melt away.%0a%0a15:16 Fear and dread shall fall upon them; by the greatness of thine%0aarm they shall be as still as a stone; till thy people pass over, O%0aLORD, till the people pass over, which thou hast purchased.%0a%0a15:17 Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of%0athine inheritance, in the place, O LORD, which thou hast made for thee%0ato dwell in, in the Sanctuary, O LORD, which thy hands have%0aestablished.%0a%0a15:18 The LORD shall reign for ever and ever.%0a%0a15:19 For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his%0ahorsemen into the sea, and the LORD brought again the waters of the%0asea upon them; but the children of Israel went on dry land in the%0amidst of the sea.%0a%0a15:20 And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel%0ain her hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and%0awith dances.%0a%0a15:21 And Miriam answered them, Sing ye to the LORD, for he hath%0atriumphed gloriously; the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the%0asea.%0a%0a15:22 So Moses brought Israel from the Red sea, and they went out into%0athe wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness,%0aand found no water.%0a%0a15:23 And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the waters%0aof Marah, for they were bitter: therefore the name of it was called%0aMarah.%0a%0a15:24 And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we%0adrink?  15:25 And he cried unto the LORD; and the LORD shewed him a%0atree, which when he had cast into the waters, the waters were made%0asweet: there he made for them a statute and an ordinance, and there he%0aproved them, 15:26 And said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to the%0avoice of the LORD thy God, and wilt do that which is right in his%0asight, and wilt give ear to his commandments, and keep all his%0astatutes, I will put none of these diseases upon thee, which I have%0abrought upon the Egyptians: for I am the LORD that healeth thee.%0a%0a15:27 And they came to Elim, where were twelve wells of water, and%0athreescore and ten palm trees: and they encamped there by the waters.%0a%0a16:1 And they took their journey from Elim, and all the congregation%0aof the children of Israel came unto the wilderness of Sin, which is%0abetween Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after%0atheir departing out of the land of Egypt.%0a%0a16:2 And the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured%0aagainst Moses and Aaron in the wilderness: 16:3 And the children of%0aIsrael said unto them, Would to God we had died by the hand of the%0aLORD in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the flesh pots, and when we%0adid eat bread to the full; for ye have brought us forth into this%0awilderness, to kill this whole assembly with hunger.%0a%0a16:4 Then said the LORD unto Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from%0aheaven for you; and the people shall go out and gather a certain rate%0aevery day, that I may prove them, whether they will walk in my law, or%0ano.%0a%0a16:5 And it shall come to pass, that on the sixth day they shall%0aprepare that which they bring in; and it shall be twice as much as%0athey gather daily.%0a%0a16:6 And Moses and Aaron said unto all the children of Israel, At%0aeven, then ye shall know that the LORD hath brought you out from the%0aland of Egypt: 16:7 And in the morning, then ye shall see the glory of%0athe LORD; for that he heareth your murmurings against the LORD: and%0awhat are we, that ye murmur against us?  16:8 And Moses said, This%0ashall be, when the LORD shall give you in the evening flesh to eat,%0aand in the morning bread to the full; for that the LORD heareth your%0amurmurings which ye murmur against him: and what are we? your%0amurmurings are not against us, but against the LORD.%0a%0a16:9 And Moses spake unto Aaron, Say unto all the congregation of the%0achildren of Israel, Come near before the LORD: for he hath heard your%0amurmurings.%0a%0a16:10 And it came to pass, as Aaron spake unto the whole congregation%0aof the children of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness,%0aand, behold, the glory of the LORD appeared in the cloud.%0a%0a16:11 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 16:12 I have heard the%0amurmurings of the children of Israel: speak unto them, saying, At even%0aye shall eat flesh, and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread;%0aand ye shall know that I am the LORD your God.%0a%0a16:13 And it came to pass, that at even the quails came up, and%0acovered the camp: and in the morning the dew lay round about the host.%0a%0a16:14 And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face of%0athe wilderness there lay a small round thing, as small as the hoar%0afrost on the ground.%0a%0a16:15 And when the children of Israel saw it, they said one to%0aanother, It is manna: for they wist not what it was. And Moses said%0aunto them, This is the bread which the LORD hath given you to eat.%0a%0a16:16 This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded, Gather of it%0aevery man according to his eating, an omer for every man, according to%0athe number of your persons; take ye every man for them which are in%0ahis tents.%0a%0a16:17 And the children of Israel did so, and gathered, some more, some%0aless.%0a%0a16:18 And when they did mete it with an omer, he that gathered much%0ahad nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack; they%0agathered every man according to his eating.%0a%0a16:19 And Moses said, Let no man leave of it till the morning.%0a%0a16:20 Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto Moses; but some of them%0aleft of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and stank: and Moses%0awas wroth with them.%0a%0a16:21 And they gathered it every morning, every man according to his%0aeating: and when the sun waxed hot, it melted.%0a%0a16:22 And it came to pass, that on the sixth day they gathered twice%0aas much bread, two omers for one man: and all the rulers of the%0acongregation came and told Moses.%0a%0a16:23 And he said unto them, This is that which the LORD hath said, To%0amorrow is the rest of the holy sabbath unto the LORD: bake that which%0aye will bake to day, and seethe that ye will seethe; and that which%0aremaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the morning.%0a%0a16:24 And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses bade: and it did%0anot stink, neither was there any worm therein.%0a%0a16:25 And Moses said, Eat that to day; for to day is a sabbath unto%0athe LORD: to day ye shall not find it in the field.%0a%0a16:26 Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day, which is%0athe sabbath, in it there shall be none.%0a%0a16:27 And it came to pass, that there went out some of the people on%0athe seventh day for to gather, and they found none.%0a%0a16:28 And the LORD said unto Moses, How long refuse ye to keep my%0acommandments and my laws?  16:29 See, for that the LORD hath given you%0athe sabbath, therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two%0adays; abide ye every man in his place, let no man go out of his place%0aon the seventh day.%0a%0a16:30 So the people rested on the seventh day.%0a%0a16:31 And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna: and it%0awas like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it was like wafers%0amade with honey.%0a%0a16:32 And Moses said, This is the thing which the LORD commandeth,%0aFill an omer of it to be kept for your generations; that they may see%0athe bread wherewith I have fed you in the wilderness, when I brought%0ayou forth from the land of Egypt.%0a%0a16:33 And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omer full of%0amanna therein, and lay it up before the LORD, to be kept for your%0agenerations.%0a%0a16:34 As the LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the%0aTestimony, to be kept.%0a%0a16:35 And the children of Israel did eat manna forty years, until they%0acame to a land inhabited; they did eat manna, until they came unto the%0aborders of the land of Canaan.%0a%0a16:36 Now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah.%0a%0a17:1 And all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from%0athe wilderness of Sin, after their journeys, according to the%0acommandment of the LORD, and pitched in Rephidim: and there was no%0awater for the people to drink.%0a%0a17:2 Wherefore the people did chide with Moses, and said, Give us%0awater that we may drink. And Moses said unto them, Why chide ye with%0ame? wherefore do ye tempt the LORD?  17:3 And the people thirsted%0athere for water; and the people murmured against Moses, and said,%0aWherefore is this that thou hast brought us up out of Egypt, to kill%0aus and our children and our cattle with thirst?  17:4 And Moses cried%0aunto the LORD, saying, What shall I do unto this people? they be%0aalmost ready to stone me.%0a%0a17:5 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go on before the people, and take%0awith thee of the elders of Israel; and thy rod, wherewith thou smotest%0athe river, take in thine hand, and go.%0a%0a17:6 Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb;%0aand thou shalt smite the rock, and there shall come water out of it,%0athat the people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the elders%0aof Israel.%0a%0a17:7 And he called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah, because%0aof the chiding of the children of Israel, and because they tempted the%0aLORD, saying, Is the LORD among us, or not?

why sittest%0athou thyself alone, and all the people stand by thee from morning unto%0aeven?  18:15 And Moses said unto his father in law, Because the people%0acome unto me to enquire of God: 18:16 When they have a matter, they%0acome unto me; and I judge between one and another, and I do make them%0aknow the statutes of God, and his laws.%0a%0a18:17 And Moses' father in law said unto him, The thing that thou%0adoest is not good.%0a%0a18:18 Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people that is%0awith thee: for this thing is too heavy for thee; thou art not able to%0aperform it thyself alone.%0a%0a18:19 Hearken now unto my voice, I will give thee counsel, and God%0ashall be with thee: Be thou for the people to God-ward, that thou%0amayest bring the causes unto God: 18:20 And thou shalt teach them%0aordinances and laws, and shalt shew them the way wherein they must%0awalk, and the work that they must do.%0a%0a18:21 Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men, such%0aas fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place such over%0athem, to be rulers of thousands, and rulers of hundreds, rulers of%0afifties, and rulers of tens: 18:22 And let them judge the people at%0aall seasons: and it shall be, that every great matter they shall bring%0aunto thee, but every small matter they shall judge: so shall it be%0aeasier for thyself, and they shall bear the burden with thee.%0a%0a18:23 If thou shalt do this thing, and God command thee so, then thou%0ashalt be able to endure, and all this people shall also go to their%0aplace in peace.%0a%0a18:24 So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father in law, and did%0aall that he had said.%0a%0a18:25 And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads%0aover the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of%0afifties, and rulers of tens.%0a%0a18:26 And they judged the people at all seasons: the hard causes they%0abrought unto Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves.%0a%0a18:27 And Moses let his father in law depart; and he went his way into%0ahis own land.%0a%0a19:1 In the third month, when the children of Israel were gone forth%0aout of the land of Egypt, the same day came they into the wilderness%0aof Sinai.%0a%0a19:2 For they were departed from Rephidim, and were come to the desert%0aof Sinai, and had pitched in the wilderness; and there Israel camped%0abefore the mount.%0a%0a19:3 And Moses went up unto God, and the LORD called unto him out of%0athe mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and%0atell the children of Israel; 19:4 Ye have seen what I did unto the%0aEgyptians, and how I bare you on eagles' wings, and brought you unto%0amyself.%0a%0a19:5 Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my%0acovenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all%0apeople: for all the earth is mine: 19:6 And ye shall be unto me a%0akingdom of priests, and an holy nation.%0a%0aThese are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of%0aIsrael.%0a%0a19:7 And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and laid%0abefore their faces all these words which the LORD commanded him.%0a%0a19:8 And all the people answered together, and said, All that the LORD%0ahath spoken we will do. And Moses returned the words of the people%0aunto the LORD.%0a%0a19:9 And the LORD said unto Moses, Lo, I come unto thee in a thick%0acloud, that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and believe%0athee for ever.%0a%0aAnd Moses told the words of the people unto the LORD.%0a%0a19:10 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go unto the people, and sanctify%0athem to day and to morrow, and let them wash their clothes, 19:11 And%0abe ready against the third day: for the third day the LORD will come%0adown in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai.%0a%0a19:12 And thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about, saying,%0aTake heed to yourselves, that ye go not up into the mount, or touch%0athe border of it: whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to%0adeath: 19:13 There shall not an hand touch it, but he shall surely be%0astoned, or shot through; whether it be beast or man, it shall not%0alive: when the trumpet soundeth long, they shall come up to the mount.%0a%0a19:14 And Moses went down from the mount unto the people, and%0asanctified the people; and they washed their clothes.%0a%0a19:15 And he said unto the people, Be ready against the third day:%0acome not at your wives.%0a%0a19:16 And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there%0awere thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and%0athe voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that%0awas in the camp trembled.%0a%0a19:17 And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with%0aGod; and they stood at the nether part of the mount.%0a%0a19:18 And mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the LORD%0adescended upon it in fire: and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke%0aof a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly.%0a%0a19:19 And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and waxed louder%0aand louder, Moses spake, and God answered him by a voice.%0a%0a19:20 And the LORD came down upon mount Sinai, on the top of the%0amount: and the LORD called Moses up to the top of the mount; and Moses%0awent up.%0a%0a19:21 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go down, charge the people, lest%0athey break through unto the LORD to gaze, and many of them perish.%0a%0a19:22 And let the priests also, which come near to the LORD, sanctify%0athemselves, lest the LORD break forth upon them.%0a%0a19:23 And Moses said unto the LORD, The people cannot come up to mount%0aSinai: for thou chargedst us, saying, Set bounds about the mount, and%0asanctify it.%0a%0a19:24 And the LORD said unto him, Away, get thee down, and thou shalt%0acome up, thou, and Aaron with thee: but let not the priests and the%0apeople break through to come up unto the LORD, lest he break forth%0aupon them.%0a%0a19:25 So Moses went down unto the people, and spake unto them.%0a%0a20:1 And God spake all these words, saying, 20:2 I am the LORD thy%0aGod, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the%0ahouse of bondage.%0a%0a20:3 Thou shalt have no other gods before me.%0a%0a20:4 Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness%0aof any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath,%0aor that is in the water under the earth.%0a%0a20:5 Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I%0athe LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the%0afathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them%0athat hate me; 20:6 And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love%0ame, and keep my commandments.%0a%0a20:7 Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain; for the%0aLORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.%0a%0a20:8 Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.%0a%0a20:9 Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work: 20:10 But the%0aseventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt not%0ado any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor%0athy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy%0agates: 20:11 For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea,%0aand all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the%0aLORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.%0a%0a20:12 Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon%0athe land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.%0a%0a20:13 Thou shalt not kill.%0a%0a20:14 Thou shalt not commit adultery.%0a%0a20:15 Thou shalt not steal.%0a%0a20:16 Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.%0a%0a20:17 Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house, thou shalt not covet%0athy neighbour's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his%0aox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbour's.%0a%0a20:18 And all the people saw the thunderings, and the lightnings, and%0athe noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and when the%0apeople saw it, they removed, and stood afar off.%0a%0a20:19 And they said unto Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will hear:%0abut let not God speak with us, lest we die.%0a%0a20:20 And Moses said unto the people, Fear not: for God is come to%0aprove you, and that his fear may be before your faces, that ye sin%0anot.%0a%0a20:21 And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near unto the%0athick darkness where God was.%0a%0a20:22 And the LORD said unto Moses, Thus thou shalt say unto the%0achildren of Israel, Ye have seen that I have talked with you from%0aheaven.%0a%0a20:23 Ye shall not make with me gods of silver, neither shall ye make%0aunto you gods of gold.%0a%0a20:24 An altar of earth thou shalt make unto me, and shalt sacrifice%0athereon thy burnt offerings, and thy peace offerings, thy sheep, and%0athine oxen: in all places where I record my name I will come unto%0athee, and I will bless thee.%0a%0a20:25 And if thou wilt make me an altar of stone, thou shalt not build%0ait of hewn stone: for if thou lift up thy tool upon it, thou hast%0apolluted it.%0a%0a20:26 Neither shalt thou go up by steps unto mine altar, that thy%0anakedness be not discovered thereon.%0a%0a21:1 Now these are the judgments which thou shalt set before them.%0a%0a21:2 If thou buy an Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve: and in%0athe seventh he shall go out free for nothing.%0a%0a21:3 If he came in by himself, he shall go out by himself: if he were%0amarried, then his wife shall go out with him.%0a%0a21:4 If his master have given him a wife, and she have born him sons%0aor daughters;

for thy people,%0awhich thou broughtest out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted%0athemselves: 32:8 They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I%0acommanded them: they have made them a molten calf, and have worshipped%0ait, and have sacrificed thereunto, and said, These be thy gods, O%0aIsrael, which have brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.%0a%0a32:9 And the LORD said unto Moses, I have seen this people, and,%0abehold, it is a stiffnecked people: 32:10 Now therefore let me alone,%0athat my wrath may wax hot against them, and that I may consume them:%0aand I will make of thee a great nation.%0a%0a32:11 And Moses besought the LORD his God, and said, LORD, why doth%0athy wrath wax hot against thy people, which thou hast brought forth%0aout of the land of Egypt with great power, and with a mighty hand?%0a32:12 Wherefore should the Egyptians speak, and say, For mischief did%0ahe bring them out, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them%0afrom the face of the earth? Turn from thy fierce wrath, and repent of%0athis evil against thy people.%0a%0a32:13 Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, to whom thou%0aswarest by thine own self, and saidst unto them, I will multiply your%0aseed as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken of%0awill I give unto your seed, and they shall inherit it for ever.%0a%0a32:14 And the LORD repented of the evil which he thought to do unto%0ahis people.%0a%0a32:15 And Moses turned, and went down from the mount, and the two%0atables of the testimony were in his hand: the tables were written on%0aboth their sides; on the one side and on the other were they written.%0a%0a32:16 And the tables were the work of God, and the writing was the%0awriting of God, graven upon the tables.%0a%0a32:17 And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted,%0ahe said unto Moses, There is a noise of war in the camp.%0a%0a32:18 And he said, It is not the voice of them that shout for mastery,%0aneither is it the voice of them that cry for being overcome: but the%0anoise of them that sing do I hear.%0a%0a32:19 And it came to pass, as soon as he came nigh unto the camp, that%0ahe saw the calf, and the dancing: and Moses' anger waxed hot, and he%0acast the tables out of his hands, and brake them beneath the mount.%0a%0a32:20 And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt it in the%0afire, and ground it to powder, and strawed it upon the water, and made%0athe children of Israel drink of it.%0a%0a32:21 And Moses said unto Aaron, What did this people unto thee, that%0athou hast brought so great a sin upon them?  32:22 And Aaron said, Let%0anot the anger of my lord wax hot: thou knowest the people, that they%0aare set on mischief.%0a%0a32:23 For they said unto me, Make us gods, which shall go before us:%0afor as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of%0aEgypt, we wot not what is become of him.%0a%0a32:24 And I said unto them, Whosoever hath any gold, let them break it%0aoff. So they gave it me: then I cast it into the fire, and there came%0aout this calf.%0a%0a32:25 And when Moses saw that the people were naked; (for Aaron had%0amade them naked unto their shame among their enemies:) 32:26 Then%0aMoses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Who is on the LORD's%0aside? let him come unto me. And all the sons of Levi gathered%0athemselves together unto him.%0a%0a32:27 And he said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Put%0aevery man his sword by his side, and go in and out from gate to gate%0athroughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his%0acompanion, and every man his neighbour.%0a%0a32:28 And the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses: and%0athere fell of the people that day about three thousand men.%0a%0a32:29 For Moses had said, Consecrate yourselves today to the LORD,%0aeven every man upon his son, and upon his brother; that he may bestow%0aupon you a blessing this day.%0a%0a32:30 And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses said unto the%0apeople, Ye have sinned a great sin: and now I will go up unto the%0aLORD; peradventure I shall make an atonement for your sin.%0a%0a32:31 And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, Oh, this people have%0asinned a great sin, and have made them gods of gold.%0a%0a32:32 Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin--; and if not, blot me,%0aI pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast written.%0a%0a32:33 And the LORD said unto Moses, Whosoever hath sinned against me,%0ahim will I blot out of my book.%0a%0a32:34 Therefore now go, lead the people unto the place of which I have%0aspoken unto thee: behold, mine Angel shall go before thee:%0anevertheless in the day when I visit I will visit their sin upon them.%0a%0a32:35 And the LORD plagued the people, because they made the calf,%0awhich Aaron made.%0a%0a33:1 And the LORD said unto Moses, Depart, and go up hence, thou and%0athe people which thou hast brought up out of the land of Egypt, unto%0athe land which I sware unto Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying,%0aUnto thy seed will I give it: 33:2 And I will send an angel before%0athee; and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the%0aHittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite: 33:3 Unto a%0aland flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go up in the midst of%0athee; for thou art a stiffnecked people: lest I consume thee in the%0away.%0a%0a33:4 And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned: and%0ano man did put on him his ornaments.%0a%0a33:5 For the LORD had said unto Moses, Say unto the children of%0aIsrael, Ye are a stiffnecked people: I will come up into the midst of%0athee in a moment, and consume thee: therefore now put off thy%0aornaments from thee, that I may know what to do unto thee.%0a%0a33:6 And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments%0aby the mount Horeb.%0a%0a33:7 And Moses took the tabernacle, and pitched it without the camp,%0aafar off from the camp, and called it the Tabernacle of the%0acongregation.

And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom and%0a%3c Raamses.%0a%3c %0a%3c 1:12 But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and%0a%3c grew.%0a%3c %0a%3c And they were grieved because of the children of Israel.%0a%3c %0a%3c 1:13 And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with%0a%3c rigour: 1:14 And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in%0a%3c morter, and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all%0a%3c their service, wherein they made them serve, was with rigour.%0a%3c %0a%3c 1:15 And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of which the%0a%3c name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah: 1:16 And%0a%3c he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and%0a%3c see them upon the stools; if it be a son, then ye shall kill him: but%0a%3c if it be a daughter, then she shall live.%0a%3c %0a%3c 1:17 But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt%0a%3c commanded them, but saved the men children alive.%0a%3c %0a%3c 1:18 And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto%0a%3c them, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men children%0a%3c alive?  1:19 And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew%0a%3c women are not as the Egyptian women; for they are lively, and are%0a%3c delivered ere the midwives come in unto them.%0a%3c %0a%3c 1:20 Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people%0a%3c multiplied, and waxed very mighty.%0a%3c %0a%3c 1:21 And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he%0a%3c made them houses.%0a%3c %0a%3c 1:22 And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is%0a%3c born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save%0a%3c alive.%0a%3c %0a%3c 2:1 And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took to wife a%0a%3c daughter of Levi.%0a%3c %0a%3c 2:2 And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she saw him that%0a%3c he was a goodly child, she hid him three months.%0a%3c %0a%3c 2:3 And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of%0a%3c bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the child%0a%3c therein; and she laid it in the flags by the river's brink.%0a%3c %0a%3c 2:4 And his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to him.%0a%3c %0a%3c 2:5 And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself at the%0a%3c river; and her maidens walked along by the river's side; and when she%0a%3c saw the ark among the flags, she sent her maid to fetch it.%0a%3c %0a%3c 2:6 And when she had opened it, she saw the child: and, behold, the%0a%3c babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of the%0a%3c Hebrews' children.%0a%3c %0a%3c 2:7 Then said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and call to%0a%3c thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for%0a%3c thee?  2:8 And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went%0a%3c and called the child's mother.%0a%3c %0a%3c 2:9 And Pharaoh's daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and%0a%3c nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages. And the women took%0a%3c the child, and nursed it.%0a%3c %0a%3c 2:10 And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh's daughter,%0a%3c and he became her son. And she called his name Moses: and she said,%0a%3c Because I drew him out of the water.%0a%3c %0a%3c 2:11 And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he%0a%3c went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he spied%0a%3c an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his brethren.%0a%3c %0a%3c 2:12 And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there%0a%3c was no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.%0a%3c %0a%3c 2:13 And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the%0a%3c Hebrews strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong,%0a%3c Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow?  2:14 And he said, Who made thee a%0a%3c prince and a judge over us? intendest thou to kill me, as thou%0a%3c killedst the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely this thing%0a%3c is known.%0a%3c %0a%3c 2:15 Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But%0a%3c Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian:%0a%3c and he sat down by a well.%0a%3c %0a%3c 2:16 Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and%0a%3c drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father's flock.%0a%3c %0a%3c 2:17 And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood up%0a%3c and helped them, and watered their flock.%0a%3c %0a%3c 2:18 And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How is it that%0a%3c ye are come so soon to day?  2:19 And they said, An Egyptian delivered%0a%3c us out of the hand of the shepherds, and also drew water enough for%0a%3c us, and watered the flock.%0a%3c %0a%3c 2:20 And he said unto his daughters, And where is he? why is it that%0a%3c ye have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread.%0a%3c %0a%3c 2:21 And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses%0a%3c Zipporah his daughter.%0a%3c %0a%3c 2:22 And she bare him a son, and he called his name Gershom: for he%0a%3c said, I have been a stranger in a strange land.%0a%3c %0a%3c 2:23 And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egypt%0a%3c died: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and%0a%3c they cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage.%0a%3c %0a%3c 2:24 And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant%0a%3c with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.%0a%3c %0a%3c 2:25 And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God had respect%0a%3c unto them.%0a%3c %0a%3c 3:1 Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father in law, the priest%0a%3c of Midian: and he led the flock to the backside of the desert, and%0a%3c came to the mountain of God, even to Horeb.%0a%3c %0a%3c 3:2 And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him in a flame of fire out%0a%3c of the midst of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned%0a%3c with fire, and the bush was not consumed.%0a%3c %0a%3c 3:3 And Moses said, I will now turn aside, and see this great sight,%0a%3c why the bush is not burnt.%0a%3c %0a%3c 3:4 And when the LORD saw that he turned aside to see, God called unto%0a%3c him out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And he said,%0a%3c Here am I.%0a%3c %0a%3c 3:5 And he said, Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off thy%0a%3c feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.%0a%3c %0a%3c 3:6 Moreover he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham,%0a%3c the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for he%0a%3c was afraid to look upon God.%0a%3c %0a%3c 3:7 And the LORD said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people%0a%3c which are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their%0a%3c taskmasters; for I know their sorrows; 3:8 And I am come down to%0a%3c deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up%0a%3c out of that land unto a good land and a large, unto a land flowing%0a%3c with milk and honey; unto the place of the Canaanites, and the%0a%3c Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and%0a%3c the Jebusites.%0a%3c %0a%3c 3:9 Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come%0a%3c unto me: and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians%0a%3c oppress them.%0a%3c %0a%3c 3:10 Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou%0a%3c mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt.%0a%3c %0a%3c 3:11 And Moses said unto God, Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh,%0a%3c and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?%0a%3c 3:12 And he said, Certainly I will be with thee; and this shall be a%0a%3c token unto thee, that I have sent thee: When thou hast brought forth%0a%3c the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain.%0a%3c %0a%3c 3:13 And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children of%0a%3c Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me%0a%3c unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? what shall I say%0a%3c unto them?  3:14 And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said,%0a%3c Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me%0a%3c unto you.%0a%3c %0a%3c 3:15 And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the%0a%3c children of Israel, the LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham,%0a%3c the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you: this is%0a%3c my name for ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations.%0a%3c %0a%3c 3:16 Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto them,%0a%3c The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of%0a%3c Jacob, appeared unto me, saying, I have surely visited you, and seen%0a%3c that which is done to you in Egypt: 3:17 And I have said, I will bring%0a%3c you up out of the affliction of Egypt unto the land of the Canaanites,%0a%3c and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the%0a%3c Hivites, and the Jebusites, unto a land flowing with milk and honey.%0a%3c %0a%3c 3:18 And they shall hearken to thy voice: and thou shalt come, thou%0a%3c and the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt, and ye shall say%0a%3c unto him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath met with us: and now let us%0a%3c go, we beseech thee, three days' journey into the wilderness, that we%0a%3c may sacrifice to the LORD our God.%0a%3c %0a%3c 3:19 And I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go, no, not%0a%3c by a mighty hand.%0a%3c %0a%3c 3:20 And I will stretch out my hand, and smite Egypt with all my%0a%3c wonders which I will do in the midst thereof: and after that he will%0a%3c let you go.%0a%3c %0a%3c 3:21 And I will give this people favour in the sight of the Egyptians:%0a%3c and it shall come to pass, that, when ye go, ye shall not go empty.%0a%3c %0a%3c 3:22 But every woman shall borrow of her neighbour, and of her that%0a%3c sojourneth in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and%0a%3c raiment: and ye shall put them upon your sons, and upon your%0a%3c daughters; and ye shall spoil the Egyptians.%0a%3c %0a%3c 4:1 And Moses answered and said, But, behold, they will not believe%0a%3c me, nor hearken unto my voice: for they will say, The LORD hath not%0a%3c appeared unto thee.%0a%3c %0a%3c 4:2 And the LORD said unto him, What is that in thine hand? And he%0a%3c said, A rod.%0a%3c %0a%3c 4:3 And he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the ground,%0a%3c and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before it.%0a%3c %0a%3c 4:4 And the LORD said unto Moses, Put forth thine hand, and take it by%0a%3c the tail. And he put forth his hand, and caught it, and it became a%0a%3c rod in his hand: 4:5 That they may believe that the LORD God of their%0a%3c fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob,%0a%3c hath appeared unto thee.%0a%3c %0a%3c 4:6 And the LORD said furthermore unto him, Put now thine hand into%0a%3c thy bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom: and when he took it%0a%3c out, behold, his hand was leprous as snow.%0a%3c %0a%3c 4:7 And he said, Put thine hand into thy bosom again. And he put his%0a%3c hand into his bosom again; and plucked it out of his bosom, and,%0a%3c behold, it was turned again as his other flesh.%0a%3c %0a%3c 4:8 And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee, neither%0a%3c hearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the%0a%3c voice of the latter sign.%0a%3c %0a%3c 4:9 And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe also these two%0a%3c signs, neither hearken unto thy voice, that thou shalt take of the%0a%3c water of the river, and pour it upon the dry land: and the water which%0a%3c thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land.%0a%3c %0a%3c 4:10 And Moses said unto the LORD, O my LORD, I am not eloquent,%0a%3c neither heretofore, nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant: but I%0a%3c am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue.%0a%3c %0a%3c 4:11 And the LORD said unto him, Who hath made man's mouth? or who%0a%3c maketh the dumb, or deaf, or the seeing, or the blind? have not I the%0a%3c LORD?  4:12 Now therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach%0a%3c thee what thou shalt say.%0a%3c %0a%3c 4:13 And he said, O my LORD, send, I pray thee, by the hand of him%0a%3c whom thou wilt send.%0a%3c %0a%3c 4:14 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Moses, and he said,%0a%3c Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother? I know that he can speak well.%0a%3c And also, behold, he cometh forth to meet thee: and when he seeth%0a%3c thee, he will be glad in his heart.%0a%3c %0a%3c 4:15 And thou shalt speak unto him, and put words in his mouth: and I%0a%3c will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what ye%0a%3c shall do.%0a%3c %0a%3c 4:16 And he shall be thy spokesman unto the people: and he shall be,%0a%3c even he shall be to thee instead of a mouth, and thou shalt be to him%0a%3c instead of God.%0a%3c %0a%3c 4:17 And thou shalt take this rod in thine hand, wherewith thou shalt%0a%3c do signs.%0a%3c %0a%3c 4:18 And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father in law, and said%0a%3c unto him, Let me go, I pray thee, and return unto my brethren which%0a%3c are in Egypt, and see whether they be yet alive. And Jethro said to%0a%3c Moses, Go in peace.%0a%3c %0a%3c 4:19 And the LORD said unto Moses in Midian, Go, return into Egypt:%0a%3c for all the men are dead which sought thy life.%0a%3c %0a%3c 4:20 And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them upon an ass,%0a%3c and he returned to the land of Egypt: and Moses took the rod of God in%0a%3c his hand.%0a%3c %0a%3c 4:21 And the LORD said unto Moses, When thou goest to return into%0a%3c Egypt, see that thou do all those wonders before Pharaoh, which I have%0a%3c put in thine hand: but I will harden his heart, that he shall not let%0a%3c the people go.%0a%3c %0a%3c 4:22 And thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, Thus saith the LORD, Israel is%0a%3c my son, even my firstborn: 4:23 And I say unto thee, Let my son go,%0a%3c that he may serve me: and if thou refuse to let him go, behold, I will%0a%3c slay thy son, even thy firstborn.%0a%3c %0a%3c 4:24 And it came to pass by the way in the inn, that the LORD met him,%0a%3c and sought to kill him.%0a%3c %0a%3c 4:25 Then Zipporah took a sharp stone, and cut off the foreskin of her%0a%3c son, and cast it at his feet, and said, Surely a bloody husband art%0a%3c thou to me.%0a%3c %0a%3c 4:26 So he let him go: then she said, A bloody husband thou art,%0a%3c because of the circumcision.%0a%3c %0a%3c 4:27 And the LORD said to Aaron, Go into the wilderness to meet Moses.%0a%3c And he went, and met him in the mount of God, and kissed him.%0a%3c %0a%3c 4:28 And Moses told Aaron all the words of the LORD who had sent him,%0a%3c and all the signs which he had commanded him.%0a%3c %0a%3c 4:29 And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of%0a%3c the children of Israel: 4:30 And Aaron spake all the words which the%0a%3c LORD had spoken unto Moses, and did the signs in the sight of the%0a%3c people.%0a%3c %0a%3c 4:31 And the people believed: and when they heard that the LORD had%0a%3c visited the children of Israel, and that he had looked upon their%0a%3c affliction, then they bowed their heads and worshipped.%0a%3c %0a%3c 5:1 And afterward Moses and Aaron went in, and told Pharaoh, Thus%0a%3c saith the LORD God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may hold a%0a%3c feast unto me in the wilderness.%0a%3c %0a%3c 5:2 And Pharaoh said, Who is the LORD, that I should obey his voice to%0a%3c let Israel go? I know not the LORD, neither will I let Israel go.%0a%3c %0a%3c 5:3 And they said, The God of the Hebrews hath met with us: let us go,%0a%3c we pray thee, three days' journey into the desert, and sacrifice unto%0a%3c the LORD our God; lest he fall upon us with pestilence, or with the%0a%3c sword.%0a%3c %0a%3c 5:4 And the king of Egypt said unto them, Wherefore do ye, Moses and%0a%3c Aaron, let the people from their works? get you unto your burdens.%0a%3c %0a%3c 5:5 And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land now are many, and%0a%3c ye make them rest from their burdens.%0a%3c %0a%3c 5:6 And Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people,%0a%3c and their officers, saying, 5:7 Ye shall no more give the people straw%0a%3c to make brick, as heretofore: let them go and gather straw for%0a%3c themselves.%0a%3c %0a%3c 5:8 And the tale of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, ye%0a%3c shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish ought thereof: for they be%0a%3c idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and sacrifice to our God.%0a%3c %0a%3c 5:9 Let there more work be laid upon the men, that they may labour%0a%3c therein; and let them not regard vain words.%0a%3c %0a%3c 5:10 And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers,%0a%3c and they spake to the people, saying, Thus saith Pharaoh, I will not%0a%3c give you straw.%0a%3c %0a%3c 5:11 Go ye, get you straw where ye can find it: yet not ought of your%0a%3c work shall be diminished.%0a%3c %0a%3c 5:12 So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of%0a%3c Egypt to gather stubble instead of straw.%0a%3c %0a%3c 5:13 And the taskmasters hasted them, saying, Fulfil your works, your%0a%3c daily tasks, as when there was straw.%0a%3c %0a%3c 5:14 And the officers of the children of Israel, which Pharaoh's%0a%3c taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and demanded, Wherefore%0a%3c have ye not fulfilled your task in making brick both yesterday and to%0a%3c day, as heretofore?  5:15 Then the officers of the children of Israel%0a%3c came and cried unto Pharaoh, saying, Wherefore dealest thou thus with%0a%3c thy servants?  5:16 There is no straw given unto thy servants, and%0a%3c they say to us, Make brick: and, behold, thy servants are beaten; but%0a%3c the fault is in thine own people.%0a%3c %0a%3c 5:17 But he said, Ye are idle, ye are idle: therefore ye say, Let us%0a%3c go and do sacrifice to the LORD.%0a%3c %0a%3c 5:18 Go therefore now, and work; for there shall no straw be given%0a%3c you, yet shall ye deliver the tale of bricks.%0a%3c %0a%3c 5:19 And the officers of the children of Israel did see that they were%0a%3c in evil case, after it was said, Ye shall not minish ought from your%0a%3c bricks of your daily task.%0a%3c %0a%3c 5:20 And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came%0a%3c forth from Pharaoh: 5:21 And they said unto them, The LORD look upon%0a%3c you, and judge; because ye have made our savour to be abhorred in the%0a%3c eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in%0a%3c their hand to slay us.%0a%3c %0a%3c 5:22 And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, LORD, wherefore hast%0a%3c thou so evil entreated this people? why is it that thou hast sent me?%0a%3c 5:23 For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath done%0a%3c evil to this people; neither hast thou delivered thy people at all.%0a%3c %0a%3c 6:1 Then the LORD said unto Moses, Now shalt thou see what I will do%0a%3c to Pharaoh: for with a strong hand shall he let them go, and with a%0a%3c strong hand shall he drive them out of his land.%0a%3c %0a%3c 6:2 And God spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I am the LORD: 6:3%0a%3c And I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by the name%0a%3c of God Almighty, but by my name JEHOVAH was I not known to them.%0a%3c %0a%3c 6:4 And I have also established my covenant with them, to give them%0a%3c the land of Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage, wherein they were%0a%3c strangers.%0a%3c %0a%3c 6:5 And I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom%0a%3c the Egyptians keep in bondage; and I have remembered my covenant.%0a%3c %0a%3c 6:6 Wherefore say unto the children of Israel, I am the LORD, and I%0a%3c will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will%0a%3c rid you out of their bondage, and I will redeem you with a stretched%0a%3c out arm, and with great judgments: 6:7 And I will take you to me for a%0a%3c people, and I will be to you a God: and ye shall know that I am the%0a%3c LORD your God, which bringeth you out from under the burdens of the%0a%3c Egyptians.%0a%3c %0a%3c 6:8 And I will bring you in unto the land, concerning the which I did%0a%3c swear to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give%0a%3c it you for an heritage: I am the LORD.%0a%3c %0a%3c 6:9 And Moses spake so unto the children of Israel: but they hearkened%0a%3c not unto Moses for anguish of spirit, and for cruel bondage.%0a%3c %0a%3c 6:10 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 6:11 Go in, speak unto%0a%3c Pharaoh king of Egypt, that he let the children of Israel go out of%0a%3c his land.%0a%3c %0a%3c 6:12 And Moses spake before the LORD, saying, Behold, the children of%0a%3c Israel have not hearkened unto me; how then shall Pharaoh hear me, who%0a%3c am of uncircumcised lips?  6:13 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto%0a%3c Aaron, and gave them a charge unto the children of Israel, and unto%0a%3c Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring the children of Israel out of the land%0a%3c of Egypt.%0a%3c %0a%3c 6:14 These be the heads of their fathers' houses: The sons of Reuben%0a%3c the firstborn of Israel; Hanoch, and Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi: these%0a%3c be the families of Reuben.%0a%3c %0a%3c 6:15 And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin,%0a%3c and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman: these are the%0a%3c families of Simeon.%0a%3c %0a%3c 6:16 And these are the names of the sons of Levi according to their%0a%3c generations; Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari: and the years of the%0a%3c life of Levi were an hundred thirty and seven years.%0a%3c %0a%3c 6:17 The sons of Gershon; Libni, and Shimi, according to their%0a%3c families.%0a%3c %0a%3c 6:18 And the sons of Kohath; Amram, and Izhar, and Hebron, and Uzziel:%0a%3c and the years of the life of Kohath were an hundred thirty and three%0a%3c years.%0a%3c %0a%3c 6:19 And the sons of Merari; Mahali and Mushi: these are the families%0a%3c of Levi according to their generations.%0a%3c %0a%3c 6:20 And Amram took him Jochebed his father's sister to wife; and she%0a%3c bare him Aaron and Moses: and the years of the life of Amram were an%0a%3c hundred and thirty and seven years.%0a%3c %0a%3c 6:21 And the sons of Izhar; Korah, and Nepheg, and Zichri.%0a%3c %0a%3c 6:22 And the sons of Uzziel; Mishael, and Elzaphan, and Zithri.%0a%3c %0a%3c 6:23 And Aaron took him Elisheba, daughter of Amminadab, sister of%0a%3c Naashon, to wife; and she bare him Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and%0a%3c Ithamar.%0a%3c %0a%3c 6:24 And the sons of Korah; Assir, and Elkanah, and Abiasaph: these%0a%3c are the families of the Korhites.%0a%3c %0a%3c 6:25 And Eleazar Aaron's son took him one of the daughters of Putiel%0a%3c to wife; and she bare him Phinehas: these are the heads of the fathers%0a%3c of the Levites according to their families.%0a%3c %0a%3c 6:26 These are that Aaron and Moses, to whom the LORD said, Bring out%0a%3c the children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their%0a%3c armies.%0a%3c %0a%3c 6:27 These are they which spake to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring out%0a%3c the children of Israel from Egypt: these are that Moses and Aaron.%0a%3c %0a%3c 6:28 And it came to pass on the day when the LORD spake unto Moses in%0a%3c the land of Egypt, 6:29 That the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, I am%0a%3c the LORD: speak thou unto Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I say unto%0a%3c thee.%0a%3c %0a%3c 6:30 And Moses said before the LORD, Behold, I am of uncircumcised%0a%3c lips, and how shall Pharaoh hearken unto me?  7:1 And the LORD said%0a%3c unto Moses, See, I have made thee a god to Pharaoh: and Aaron thy%0a%3c brother shall be thy prophet.%0a%3c %0a%3c 7:2 Thou shalt speak all that I command thee: and Aaron thy brother%0a%3c shall speak unto Pharaoh, that he send the children of Israel out of%0a%3c his land.%0a%3c %0a%3c 7:3 And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and multiply my signs and my%0a%3c wonders in the land of Egypt.%0a%3c %0a%3c 7:4 But Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you, that I may lay my hand%0a%3c upon Egypt, and bring forth mine armies, and my people the children of%0a%3c Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great judgments.%0a%3c %0a%3c 7:5 And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I stretch%0a%3c forth mine hand upon Egypt, and bring out the children of Israel from%0a%3c among them.%0a%3c %0a%3c 7:6 And Moses and Aaron did as the LORD commanded them, so did they.%0a%3c %0a%3c 7:7 And Moses was fourscore years old, and Aaron fourscore and three%0a%3c years old, when they spake unto Pharaoh.%0a%3c %0a%3c 7:8 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, 7:9 When%0a%3c Pharaoh shall speak unto you, saying, Shew a miracle for you: then%0a%3c thou shalt say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and cast it before Pharaoh,%0a%3c and it shall become a serpent.%0a%3c %0a%3c 7:10 And Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh, and they did so as the%0a%3c LORD had commanded: and Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh, and%0a%3c before his servants, and it became a serpent.%0a%3c %0a%3c 7:11 Then Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers: now the%0a%3c magicians of Egypt, they also did in like manner with their%0a%3c enchantments.%0a%3c %0a%3c 7:12 For they cast down every man his rod, and they became serpents:%0a%3c but Aaron's rod swallowed up their rods.%0a%3c %0a%3c 7:13 And he hardened Pharaoh's heart, that he hearkened not unto them;%0a%3c as the LORD had said.%0a%3c %0a%3c 7:14 And the LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh's heart is hardened, he%0a%3c refuseth to let the people go.%0a%3c %0a%3c 7:15 Get thee unto Pharaoh in the morning; lo, he goeth out unto the%0a%3c water; and thou shalt stand by the river's brink against he come; and%0a%3c the rod which was turned to a serpent shalt thou take in thine hand.%0a%3c %0a%3c 7:16 And thou shalt say unto him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath%0a%3c sent me unto thee, saying, Let my people go, that they may serve me in%0a%3c the wilderness: and, behold, hitherto thou wouldest not hear.%0a%3c %0a%3c 7:17 Thus saith the LORD, In this thou shalt know that I am the LORD:%0a%3c behold, I will smite with the rod that is in mine hand upon the waters%0a%3c which are in the river, and they shall be turned to blood.%0a%3c %0a%3c 7:18 And the fish that is in the river shall die, and the river shall%0a%3c stink; and the Egyptians shall lothe to drink of the water of the%0a%3c river.%0a%3c %0a%3c 7:19 And the LORD spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and%0a%3c stretch out thine hand upon the waters of Egypt, upon their streams,%0a%3c upon their rivers, and upon their ponds, and upon all their pools of%0a%3c water, that they may become blood; and that there may be blood%0a%3c throughout all the land of Egypt, both in vessels of wood, and in%0a%3c vessels of stone.%0a%3c %0a%3c 7:20 And Moses and Aaron did so, as the LORD commanded; and he lifted%0a%3c up the rod, and smote the waters that were in the river, in the sight%0a%3c of Pharaoh, and in the sight of his servants; and all the waters that%0a%3c were in the river were turned to blood.%0a%3c %0a%3c 7:21 And the fish that was in the river died; and the river stank, and%0a%3c the Egyptians could not drink of the water of the river; and there was%0a%3c blood throughout all the land of Egypt.%0a%3c %0a%3c 7:22 And the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments: and%0a%3c Pharaoh's heart was hardened, neither did he hearken unto them; as the%0a%3c LORD had said.%0a%3c %0a%3c 7:23 And Pharaoh turned and went into his house, neither did he set%0a%3c his heart to this also.%0a%3c %0a%3c 7:24 And all the Egyptians digged round about the river for water to%0a%3c drink; for they could not drink of the water of the river.%0a%3c %0a%3c 7:25 And seven days were fulfilled, after that the LORD had smitten%0a%3c the river.%0a%3c %0a%3c 8:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, Go unto Pharaoh, and say unto him,%0a%3c Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me.%0a%3c %0a%3c 8:2 And if thou refuse to let them go, behold, I will smite all thy%0a%3c borders with frogs: 8:3 And the river shall bring forth frogs%0a%3c abundantly, which shall go up and come into thine house, and into thy%0a%3c bedchamber, and upon thy bed, and into the house of thy servants, and%0a%3c upon thy people, and into thine ovens, and into thy kneadingtroughs:%0a%3c 8:4 And the frogs shall come up both on thee, and upon thy people, and%0a%3c upon all thy servants.%0a%3c %0a%3c 8:5 And the LORD spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch forth thine%0a%3c hand with thy rod over the streams, over the rivers, and over the%0a%3c ponds, and cause frogs to come up upon the land of Egypt.%0a%3c %0a%3c 8:6 And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the%0a%3c frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt.%0a%3c %0a%3c 8:7 And the magicians did so with their enchantments, and brought up%0a%3c frogs upon the land of Egypt.%0a%3c %0a%3c 8:8 Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, Intreat the%0a%3c LORD, that he may take away the frogs from me, and from my people; and%0a%3c I will let the people go, that they may do sacrifice unto the LORD.%0a%3c %0a%3c 8:9 And Moses said unto Pharaoh, Glory over me: when shall I intreat%0a%3c for thee, and for thy servants, and for thy people, to destroy the%0a%3c frogs from thee and thy houses, that they may remain in the river%0a%3c only?  8:10 And he said, To morrow. And he said, Be it according to%0a%3c thy word: that thou mayest know that there is none like unto the LORD%0a%3c our God.%0a%3c %0a%3c 8:11 And the frogs shall depart from thee, and from thy houses, and%0a%3c from thy servants, and from thy people; they shall remain in the river%0a%3c only.%0a%3c %0a%3c 8:12 And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh: and Moses cried unto%0a%3c the LORD because of the frogs which he had brought against Pharaoh.%0a%3c %0a%3c 8:13 And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and the frogs%0a%3c died out of the houses, out of the villages, and out of the fields.%0a%3c %0a%3c 8:14 And they gathered them together upon heaps: and the land stank.%0a%3c %0a%3c 8:15 But when Pharaoh saw that there was respite, he hardened his%0a%3c heart, and hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said.%0a%3c %0a%3c 8:16 And the LORD said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch out thy%0a%3c rod, and smite the dust of the land, that it may become lice%0a%3c throughout all the land of Egypt.%0a%3c %0a%3c 8:17 And they did so; for Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod,%0a%3c and smote the dust of the earth, and it became lice in man, and in%0a%3c beast; all the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of%0a%3c Egypt.%0a%3c %0a%3c 8:18 And the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth%0a%3c lice, but they could not: so there were lice upon man, and upon beast.%0a%3c %0a%3c 8:19 Then the magicians said unto Pharaoh, This is the finger of God:%0a%3c and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he hearkened not unto them; as%0a%3c the LORD had said.%0a%3c %0a%3c 8:20 And the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and%0a%3c stand before Pharaoh; lo, he cometh forth to the water; and say unto%0a%3c him, Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me.%0a%3c %0a%3c 8:21 Else, if thou wilt not let my people go, behold, I will send%0a%3c swarms of flies upon thee, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people,%0a%3c and into thy houses: and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of%0a%3c swarms of flies, and also the ground whereon they are.%0a%3c %0a%3c 8:22 And I will sever in that day the land of Goshen, in which my%0a%3c people dwell, that no swarms of flies shall be there; to the end thou%0a%3c mayest know that I am the LORD in the midst of the earth.%0a%3c %0a%3c 8:23 And I will put a division between my people and thy people: to%0a%3c morrow shall this sign be.%0a%3c %0a%3c 8:24 And the LORD did so; and there came a grievous swarm of flies%0a%3c into the house of Pharaoh, and into his servants' houses, and into all%0a%3c the land of Egypt: the land was corrupted by reason of the swarm of%0a%3c flies.%0a%3c %0a%3c 8:25 And Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and said, Go ye,%0a%3c sacrifice to your God in the land.%0a%3c %0a%3c 8:26 And Moses said, It is not meet so to do; for we shall sacrifice%0a%3c the abomination of the Egyptians to the LORD our God: lo, shall we%0a%3c sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, and will%0a%3c they not stone us?  8:27 We will go three days' journey into the%0a%3c wilderness, and sacrifice to the LORD our God, as he shall command us.%0a%3c %0a%3c 8:28 And Pharaoh said, I will let you go, that ye may sacrifice to the%0a%3c LORD your God in the wilderness; only ye shall not go very far away:%0a%3c intreat for me.%0a%3c %0a%3c 8:29 And Moses said, Behold, I go out from thee, and I will intreat%0a%3c the LORD that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh, from his%0a%3c servants, and from his people, to morrow: but let not Pharaoh deal%0a%3c deceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the%0a%3c LORD.%0a%3c %0a%3c 8:30 And Moses went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the LORD.%0a%3c %0a%3c 8:31 And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and he removed%0a%3c the swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his%0a%3c people; there remained not one.%0a%3c %0a%3c 8:32 And Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also, neither would%0a%3c he let the people go.%0a%3c %0a%3c 9:1 Then the LORD said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh, and tell him,%0a%3c Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they%0a%3c may serve me.%0a%3c %0a%3c 9:2 For if thou refuse to let them go, and wilt hold them still, 9:3%0a%3c Behold, the hand of the LORD is upon thy cattle which is in the field,%0a%3c upon the horses, upon the asses, upon the camels, upon the oxen, and%0a%3c upon the sheep: there shall be a very grievous murrain.%0a%3c %0a%3c 9:4 And the LORD shall sever between the cattle of Israel and the%0a%3c cattle of Egypt: and there shall nothing die of all that is the%0a%3c children's of Israel.%0a%3c %0a%3c 9:5 And the LORD appointed a set time, saying, To morrow the LORD%0a%3c shall do this thing in the land.%0a%3c %0a%3c 9:6 And the LORD did that thing on the morrow, and all the cattle of%0a%3c Egypt died: but of the cattle of the children of Israel died not one.%0a%3c %0a%3c 9:7 And Pharaoh sent, and, behold, there was not one of the cattle of%0a%3c the Israelites dead. And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did%0a%3c not let the people go.%0a%3c %0a%3c 9:8 And the LORD said unto Moses and unto Aaron, Take to you handfuls%0a%3c of ashes of the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it toward the heaven%0a%3c in the sight of Pharaoh.%0a%3c %0a%3c 9:9 And it shall become small dust in all the land of Egypt, and shall%0a%3c be a boil breaking forth with blains upon man, and upon beast,%0a%3c throughout all the land of Egypt.%0a%3c %0a%3c 9:10 And they took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh; and%0a%3c Moses sprinkled it up toward heaven; and it became a boil breaking%0a%3c forth with blains upon man, and upon beast.%0a%3c %0a%3c 9:11 And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the%0a%3c boils; for the boil was upon the magicians, and upon all the%0a%3c Egyptians.%0a%3c %0a%3c 9:12 And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he hearkened not%0a%3c unto them; as the LORD had spoken unto Moses.%0a%3c %0a%3c 9:13 And the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and%0a%3c stand before Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of the%0a%3c Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me.%0a%3c %0a%3c 9:14 For I will at this time send all my plagues upon thine heart, and%0a%3c upon thy servants, and upon thy people; that thou mayest know that%0a%3c there is none like me in all the earth.%0a%3c %0a%3c 9:15 For now I will stretch out my hand, that I may smite thee and thy%0a%3c people with pestilence; and thou shalt be cut off from the earth.%0a%3c %0a%3c 9:16 And in very deed for this cause have I raised thee up, for to%0a%3c shew in thee my power; and that my name may be declared throughout all%0a%3c the earth.%0a%3c %0a%3c 9:17 As yet exaltest thou thyself against my people, that thou wilt%0a%3c not let them go?  9:18 Behold, to morrow about this time I will cause%0a%3c it to rain a very grievous hail, such as hath not been in Egypt since%0a%3c the foundation thereof even until now.%0a%3c %0a%3c 9:19 Send therefore now, and gather thy cattle, and all that thou hast%0a%3c in the field; for upon every man and beast which shall be found in the%0a%3c field, and shall not be brought home, the hail shall come down upon%0a%3c them, and they shall die.%0a%3c %0a%3c 9:20 He that feared the word of the LORD among the servants of Pharaoh%0a%3c made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses: 9:21 And he%0a%3c that regarded not the word of the LORD left his servants and his%0a%3c cattle in the field.%0a%3c %0a%3c 9:22 And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch forth thine hand toward%0a%3c heaven, that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, upon man, and%0a%3c upon beast, and upon every herb of the field, throughout the land of%0a%3c Egypt.%0a%3c %0a%3c 9:23 And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven: and the LORD%0a%3c sent thunder and hail, and the fire ran along upon the ground; and the%0a%3c LORD rained hail upon the land of Egypt.%0a%3c %0a%3c 9:24 So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous,%0a%3c such as there was none like it in all the land of Egypt since it%0a%3c became a nation.%0a%3c %0a%3c 9:25 And the hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all that was%0a%3c in the field, both man and beast; and the hail smote every herb of the%0a%3c field, and brake every tree of the field.%0a%3c %0a%3c 9:26 Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel were,%0a%3c was there no hail.%0a%3c %0a%3c 9:27 And Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said unto%0a%3c them, I have sinned this time: the LORD is righteous, and I and my%0a%3c people are wicked.%0a%3c %0a%3c 9:28 Intreat the LORD (for it is enough) that there be no more mighty%0a%3c thunderings and hail; and I will let you go, and ye shall stay no%0a%3c longer.%0a%3c %0a%3c 9:29 And Moses said unto him, As soon as I am gone out of the city, I%0a%3c will spread abroad my hands unto the LORD; and the thunder shall%0a%3c cease, neither shall there be any more hail; that thou mayest know how%0a%3c that the earth is the LORD's.%0a%3c %0a%3c 9:30 But as for thee and thy servants, I know that ye will not yet%0a%3c fear the LORD God.%0a%3c %0a%3c 9:31 And the flax and the barley was smitten: for the barley was in%0a%3c the ear, and the flax was bolled.%0a%3c %0a%3c 9:32 But the wheat and the rie were not smitten: for they were not%0a%3c grown up.%0a%3c %0a%3c 9:33 And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroad%0a%3c his hands unto the LORD: and the thunders and hail ceased, and the%0a%3c rain was not poured upon the earth.%0a%3c %0a%3c 9:34 And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders%0a%3c were ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and his%0a%3c servants.%0a%3c %0a%3c 9:35 And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, neither would he let the%0a%3c children of Israel go; as the LORD had spoken by Moses.%0a%3c %0a%3c 10:1 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh: for I have%0a%3c hardened his heart, and the heart of his servants, that I might shew%0a%3c these my signs before him: 10:2 And that thou mayest tell in the ears%0a%3c of thy son, and of thy son's son, what things I have wrought in Egypt,%0a%3c and my signs which I have done among them; that ye may know how that I%0a%3c am the LORD.%0a%3c %0a%3c 10:3 And Moses and Aaron came in unto Pharaoh, and said unto him, Thus%0a%3c saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, How long wilt thou refuse to humble%0a%3c thyself before me? let my people go, that they may serve me.%0a%3c %0a%3c 10:4 Else, if thou refuse to let my people go, behold, to morrow will%0a%3c I bring the locusts into thy coast: 10:5 And they shall cover the face%0a%3c of the earth, that one cannot be able to see the earth: and they shall%0a%3c eat the residue of that which is escaped, which remaineth unto you%0a%3c from the hail, and shall eat every tree which groweth for you out of%0a%3c the field: 10:6 And they shall fill thy houses, and the houses of all%0a%3c thy servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians; which neither thy%0a%3c fathers, nor thy fathers' fathers have seen, since the day that they%0a%3c were upon the earth unto this day. And he turned himself, and went out%0a%3c from Pharaoh.%0a%3c %0a%3c 10:7 And Pharaoh's servants said unto him, How long shall this man be%0a%3c a snare unto us? let the men go, that they may serve the LORD their%0a%3c God: knowest thou not yet that Egypt is destroyed?  10:8 And Moses and%0a%3c Aaron were brought again unto Pharaoh: and he said unto them, Go,%0a%3c serve the LORD your God: but who are they that shall go?  10:9 And%0a%3c Moses said, We will go with our young and with our old, with our sons%0a%3c and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds will we go;%0a%3c for we must hold a feast unto the LORD.%0a%3c %0a%3c 10:10 And he said unto them, Let the LORD be so with you, as I will%0a%3c let you go, and your little ones: look to it; for evil is before you.%0a%3c %0a%3c 10:11 Not so: go now ye that are men, and serve the LORD; for that ye%0a%3c did desire. And they were driven out from Pharaoh's presence.%0a%3c %0a%3c 10:12 And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the%0a%3c land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up upon the land of%0a%3c Egypt, and eat every herb of the land, even all that the hail hath%0a%3c left.%0a%3c %0a%3c 10:13 And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and%0a%3c the LORD brought an east wind upon the land all that day, and all that%0a%3c night; and when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts.%0a%3c %0a%3c 10:14 And the locust went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in%0a%3c all the coasts of Egypt: very grievous were they; before them there%0a%3c were no such locusts as they, neither after them shall be such.%0a%3c %0a%3c 10:15 For they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land%0a%3c was darkened; and they did eat every herb of the land, and all the%0a%3c fruit of the trees which the hail had left: and there remained not any%0a%3c green thing in the trees, or in the herbs of the field, through all%0a%3c the land of Egypt.%0a%3c %0a%3c 10:16 Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste; and he said, I%0a%3c have sinned against the LORD your God, and against you.%0a%3c %0a%3c 10:17 Now therefore forgive, I pray thee, my sin only this once, and%0a%3c intreat the LORD your God, that he may take away from me this death%0a%3c only.%0a%3c %0a%3c 10:18 And he went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the LORD.%0a%3c %0a%3c 10:19 And the LORD turned a mighty strong west wind, which took away%0a%3c the locusts, and cast them into the Red sea; there remained not one%0a%3c locust in all the coasts of Egypt.%0a%3c %0a%3c 10:20 But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not let%0a%3c the children of Israel go.%0a%3c %0a%3c 10:21 And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand toward%0a%3c heaven, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even%0a%3c darkness which may be felt.%0a%3c %0a%3c 10:22 And Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven; and there was%0a%3c a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days: 10:23 They saw%0a%3c not one another, neither rose any from his place for three days: but%0a%3c all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings.%0a%3c %0a%3c 10:24 And Pharaoh called unto Moses, and said, Go ye, serve the LORD;%0a%3c only let your flocks and your herds be stayed: let your little ones%0a%3c also go with you.%0a%3c %0a%3c 10:25 And Moses said, Thou must give us also sacrifices and burnt%0a%3c offerings, that we may sacrifice unto the LORD our God.%0a%3c %0a%3c 10:26 Our cattle also shall go with us; there shall not an hoof be%0a%3c left behind; for thereof must we take to serve the LORD our God; and%0a%3c we know not with what we must serve the LORD, until we come thither.%0a%3c %0a%3c 10:27 But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he would not let them%0a%3c go.%0a%3c %0a%3c 10:28 And Pharaoh said unto him, Get thee from me, take heed to%0a%3c thyself, see my face no more; for in that day thou seest my face thou%0a%3c shalt die.%0a%3c %0a%3c 10:29 And Moses said, Thou hast spoken well, I will see thy face again%0a%3c no more.%0a%3c %0a%3c 11:1 And the LORD said unto Moses, Yet will I bring one plague more%0a%3c upon Pharaoh, and upon Egypt; afterwards he will let you go hence:%0a%3c when he shall let you go, he shall surely thrust you out hence%0a%3c altogether.%0a%3c %0a%3c 11:2 Speak now in the ears of the people, and let every man borrow of%0a%3c his neighbour, and every woman of her neighbour, jewels of silver and%0a%3c jewels of gold.%0a%3c %0a%3c 11:3 And the LORD gave the people favour in the sight of the%0a%3c Egyptians.%0a%3c %0a%3c Moreover the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, in the%0a%3c sight of Pharaoh's servants, and in the sight of the people.%0a%3c %0a%3c 11:4 And Moses said, Thus saith the LORD, About midnight will I go out%0a%3c into the midst of Egypt: 11:5 And all the firstborn in the land of%0a%3c Egypt shall die, from the first born of Pharaoh that sitteth upon his%0a%3c throne, even unto the firstborn of the maidservant that is behind the%0a%3c mill; and all the firstborn of beasts.%0a%3c %0a%3c 11:6 And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt,%0a%3c such as there was none like it, nor shall be like it any more.%0a%3c %0a%3c 11:7 But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move%0a%3c his tongue, against man or beast: that ye may know how that the LORD%0a%3c doth put a difference between the Egyptians and Israel.%0a%3c %0a%3c 11:8 And all these thy servants shall come down unto me, and bow down%0a%3c themselves unto me, saying, Get thee out, and all the people that%0a%3c follow thee: and after that I will go out. And he went out from%0a%3c Pharaoh in a great anger.%0a%3c %0a%3c 11:9 And the LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you;%0a%3c that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt.%0a%3c %0a%3c 11:10 And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh: and%0a%3c the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not let the%0a%3c children of Israel go out of his land.%0a%3c %0a%3c 12:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt%0a%3c saying, 12:2 This month shall be unto you the beginning of months: it%0a%3c shall be the first month of the year to you.%0a%3c %0a%3c 12:3 Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the%0a%3c tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb,%0a%3c according to the house of their fathers, a lamb for an house: 12:4 And%0a%3c if the household be too little for the lamb, let him and his neighbour%0a%3c next unto his house take it according to the number of the souls;%0a%3c every man according to his eating shall make your count for the lamb.%0a%3c %0a%3c 12:5 Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year: ye%0a%3c shall take it out from the sheep, or from the goats: 12:6 And ye shall%0a%3c keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month: and the whole%0a%3c assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening.%0a%3c %0a%3c 12:7 And they shall take of the blood, and strike it on the two side%0a%3c posts and on the upper door post of the houses, wherein they shall eat%0a%3c it.%0a%3c %0a%3c 12:8 And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire, and%0a%3c unleavened bread; and with bitter herbs they shall eat it.%0a%3c %0a%3c 12:9 Eat not of it raw, nor sodden at all with water, but roast with%0a%3c fire; his head with his legs, and with the purtenance thereof.%0a%3c %0a%3c 12:10 And ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning; and%0a%3c that which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire.%0a%3c %0a%3c 12:11 And thus shall ye eat it; with your loins girded, your shoes on%0a%3c your feet, and your staff in your hand; and ye shall eat it in haste:%0a%3c it is the LORD's passover.%0a%3c %0a%3c 12:12 For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night, and will%0a%3c smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and%0a%3c against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment: I am the LORD.%0a%3c %0a%3c 12:13 And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where%0a%3c ye are: and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and the plague%0a%3c shall not be upon you to destroy you, when I smite the land of Egypt.%0a%3c %0a%3c 12:14 And this day shall be unto you for a memorial; and ye shall keep%0a%3c it a feast to the LORD throughout your generations; ye shall keep it a%0a%3c feast by an ordinance for ever.%0a%3c %0a%3c 12:15 Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread; even the first day ye%0a%3c shall put away leaven out of your houses: for whosoever eateth%0a%3c leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that soul%0a%3c shall be cut off from Israel.%0a%3c %0a%3c 12:16 And in the first day there shall be an holy convocation, and in%0a%3c the seventh day there shall be an holy convocation to you; no manner%0a%3c of work shall be done in them, save that which every man must eat,%0a%3c that only may be done of you.%0a%3c %0a%3c 12:17 And ye shall observe the feast of unleavened bread; for in this%0a%3c selfsame day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt:%0a%3c therefore shall ye observe this day in your generations by an%0a%3c ordinance for ever.%0a%3c %0a%3c 12:18 In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at even,%0a%3c ye shall eat unleavened bread, until the one and twentieth day of the%0a%3c month at even.%0a%3c %0a%3c 12:19 Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses: for%0a%3c whosoever eateth that which is leavened, even that soul shall be cut%0a%3c off from the congregation of Israel, whether he be a stranger, or born%0a%3c in the land.%0a%3c %0a%3c 12:20 Ye shall eat nothing leavened; in all your habitations shall ye%0a%3c eat unleavened bread.%0a%3c %0a%3c 12:21 Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said unto%0a%3c them, Draw out and take you a lamb according to your families, and%0a%3c kill the passover.%0a%3c %0a%3c 12:22 And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood%0a%3c that is in the bason, and strike the lintel and the two side posts%0a%3c with the blood that is in the bason; and none of you shall go out at%0a%3c the door of his house until the morning.%0a%3c %0a%3c 12:23 For the LORD will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when%0a%3c he seeth the blood upon the lintel, and on the two side posts, the%0a%3c LORD will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to%0a%3c come in unto your houses to smite you.%0a%3c %0a%3c 12:24 And ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to%0a%3c thy sons for ever.%0a%3c %0a%3c 12:25 And it shall come to pass, when ye be come to the land which the%0a%3c LORD will give you, according as he hath promised, that ye shall keep%0a%3c this service.%0a%3c %0a%3c 12:26 And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say unto%0a%3c you, What mean ye by this service?  12:27 That ye shall say, It is the%0a%3c sacrifice of the LORD's passover, who passed over the houses of the%0a%3c children of Israel in Egypt, when he smote the Egyptians, and%0a%3c delivered our houses. And the people bowed the head and worshipped.%0a%3c %0a%3c 12:28 And the children of Israel went away, and did as the LORD had%0a%3c commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.%0a%3c %0a%3c 12:29 And it came to pass, that at midnight the LORD smote all the%0a%3c firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sat%0a%3c on his throne unto the firstborn of the captive that was in the%0a%3c dungeon; and all the firstborn of cattle.%0a%3c %0a%3c 12:30 And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and%0a%3c all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt; for there was%0a%3c not a house where there was not one dead.%0a%3c %0a%3c 12:31 And he called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Rise up,%0a%3c and get you forth from among my people, both ye and the children of%0a%3c Israel; and go, serve the LORD, as ye have said.%0a%3c %0a%3c 12:32 Also take your flocks and your herds, as ye have said, and be%0a%3c gone; and bless me also.%0a%3c %0a%3c 12:33 And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, that they might%0a%3c send them out of the land in haste; for they said, We be all dead men.%0a%3c %0a%3c 12:34 And the people took their dough before it was leavened, their%0a%3c kneadingtroughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders.%0a%3c %0a%3c 12:35 And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses;%0a%3c and they borrowed of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of%0a%3c gold, and raiment: 12:36 And the LORD gave the people favour in the%0a%3c sight of the Egyptians, so that they lent unto them such things as%0a%3c they required. And they spoiled the Egyptians.%0a%3c %0a%3c 12:37 And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth,%0a%3c about six hundred thousand on foot that were men, beside children.%0a%3c %0a%3c 12:38 And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and%0a%3c herds, even very much cattle.%0a%3c %0a%3c 12:39 And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought%0a%3c forth out of Egypt, for it was not leavened; because they were thrust%0a%3c out of Egypt, and could not tarry, neither had they prepared for%0a%3c themselves any victual.%0a%3c %0a%3c 12:40 Now the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelt in%0a%3c Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years.%0a%3c %0a%3c 12:41 And it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty%0a%3c years, even the selfsame day it came to pass, that all the hosts of%0a%3c the LORD went out from the land of Egypt.%0a%3c %0a%3c 12:42 It is a night to be much observed unto the LORD for bringing%0a%3c them out from the land of Egypt: this is that night of the LORD to be%0a%3c observed of all the children of Israel in their generations.%0a%3c %0a%3c 12:43 And the LORD said unto Moses and Aaron, This is the ordinance of%0a%3c the passover: There shall no stranger eat thereof: 12:44 But every%0a%3c man's servant that is bought for money, when thou hast circumcised%0a%3c him, then shall he eat thereof.%0a%3c %0a%3c 12:45 A foreigner and an hired servant shall not eat thereof.%0a%3c %0a%3c 12:46 In one house shall it be eaten; thou shalt not carry forth ought%0a%3c of the flesh abroad out of the house; neither shall ye break a bone%0a%3c thereof.%0a%3c %0a%3c 12:47 All the congregation of Israel shall keep it.%0a%3c %0a%3c 12:48 And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee, and will keep the%0a%3c passover to the LORD, let all his males be circumcised, and then let%0a%3c him come near and keep it; and he shall be as one that is born in the%0a%3c land: for no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof.%0a%3c %0a%3c 12:49 One law shall be to him that is homeborn, and unto the stranger%0a%3c that sojourneth among you.%0a%3c %0a%3c 12:50 Thus did all the children of Israel; as the LORD commanded Moses%0a%3c and Aaron, so did they.%0a%3c %0a%3c 12:51 And it came to pass the selfsame day, that the LORD did bring%0a%3c the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies.%0a%3c %0a%3c 13:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 13:2 Sanctify unto me all%0a%3c the firstborn, whatsoever openeth the womb among the children of%0a%3c Israel, both of man and of beast: it is mine.%0a%3c %0a%3c 13:3 And Moses said unto the people, Remember this day, in which ye%0a%3c came out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by strength of%0a%3c hand the LORD brought you out from this place: there shall no leavened%0a%3c bread be eaten.%0a%3c %0a%3c 13:4 This day came ye out in the month Abib.%0a%3c %0a%3c 13:5 And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land of%0a%3c the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Hivites,%0a%3c and the Jebusites, which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee, a%0a%3c land flowing with milk and honey, that thou shalt keep this service in%0a%3c this month.%0a%3c %0a%3c 13:6 Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, and in the seventh%0a%3c day shall be a feast to the LORD.%0a%3c %0a%3c 13:7 Unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days; and there shall no%0a%3c leavened bread be seen with thee, neither shall there be leaven seen%0a%3c with thee in all thy quarters.%0a%3c %0a%3c 13:8 And thou shalt shew thy son in that day, saying, This is done%0a%3c because of that which the LORD did unto me when I came forth out of%0a%3c Egypt.%0a%3c %0a%3c 13:9 And it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thine hand, and for a%0a%3c memorial between thine eyes, that the LORD's law may be in thy mouth:%0a%3c for with a strong hand hath the LORD brought thee out of Egypt.%0a%3c %0a%3c 13:10 Thou shalt therefore keep this ordinance in his season from year%0a%3c to year.%0a%3c %0a%3c 13:11 And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land of%0a%3c the Canaanites, as he sware unto thee and to thy fathers, and shall%0a%3c give it thee, 13:12 That thou shalt set apart unto the LORD all that%0a%3c openeth the matrix, and every firstling that cometh of a beast which%0a%3c thou hast; the males shall be the LORD's.%0a%3c %0a%3c 13:13 And every firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb; and%0a%3c if thou wilt not redeem it, then thou shalt break his neck: and all%0a%3c the firstborn of man among thy children shalt thou redeem.%0a%3c %0a%3c 13:14 And it shall be when thy son asketh thee in time to come,%0a%3c saying, What is this? that thou shalt say unto him, By strength of%0a%3c hand the LORD brought us out from Egypt, from the house of bondage:%0a%3c 13:15 And it came to pass, when Pharaoh would hardly let us go, that%0a%3c the LORD slew all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the%0a%3c firstborn of man, and the firstborn of beast: therefore I sacrifice to%0a%3c the LORD all that openeth the matrix, being males; but all the%0a%3c firstborn of my children I redeem.%0a%3c %0a%3c 13:16 And it shall be for a token upon thine hand, and for frontlets%0a%3c between thine eyes: for by strength of hand the LORD brought us forth%0a%3c out of Egypt.%0a%3c %0a%3c 13:17 And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that%0a%3c God led them not through the way of the land of the Philistines,%0a%3c although that was near; for God said, Lest peradventure the people%0a%3c repent when they see war, and they return to Egypt: 13:18 But God led%0a%3c the people about, through the way of the wilderness of the Red sea:%0a%3c and the children of Israel went up harnessed out of the land of Egypt.%0a%3c %0a%3c 13:19 And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him: for he had straitly%0a%3c sworn the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you; and%0a%3c ye shall carry up my bones away hence with you.%0a%3c %0a%3c 13:20 And they took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in Etham,%0a%3c in the edge of the wilderness.%0a%3c %0a%3c 13:21 And the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, to%0a%3c lead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them%0a%3c light; to go by day and night: 13:22 He took not away the pillar of%0a%3c the cloud by day, nor the pillar of fire by night, from before the%0a%3c people.%0a%3c %0a%3c 14:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 14:2 Speak unto the%0a%3c children of Israel, that they turn and encamp before Pihahiroth,%0a%3c between Migdol and the sea, over against Baalzephon: before it shall%0a%3c ye encamp by the sea.%0a%3c %0a%3c 14:3 For Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, They are%0a%3c entangled in the land, the wilderness hath shut them in.%0a%3c %0a%3c 14:4 And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, that he shall follow after%0a%3c them; and I will be honoured upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host; that%0a%3c the Egyptians may know that I am the LORD. And they did so.%0a%3c %0a%3c 14:5 And it was told the king of Egypt that the people fled: and the%0a%3c heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people,%0a%3c and they said, Why have we done this, that we have let Israel go from%0a%3c serving us?  14:6 And he made ready his chariot, and took his people%0a%3c with him: 14:7 And he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the%0a%3c chariots of Egypt, and captains over every one of them.%0a%3c %0a%3c 14:8 And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he%0a%3c pursued after the children of Israel: and the children of Israel went%0a%3c out with an high hand.%0a%3c %0a%3c 14:9 But the Egyptians pursued after them, all the horses and chariots%0a%3c of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army, and overtook them%0a%3c encamping by the sea, beside Pihahiroth, before Baalzephon.%0a%3c %0a%3c 14:10 And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted up%0a%3c their eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians marched after them; and they%0a%3c were sore afraid: and the children of Israel cried out unto the LORD.%0a%3c %0a%3c 14:11 And they said unto Moses, Because there were no graves in Egypt,%0a%3c hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness? wherefore hast thou%0a%3c dealt thus with us, to carry us forth out of Egypt?  14:12 Is not this%0a%3c the word that we did tell thee in Egypt, saying, Let us alone, that we%0a%3c may serve the Egyptians? For it had been better for us to serve the%0a%3c Egyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness.%0a%3c %0a%3c 14:13 And Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not, stand still, and%0a%3c see the salvation of the LORD, which he will shew to you to day: for%0a%3c the Egyptians whom ye have seen to day, ye shall see them again no%0a%3c more for ever.%0a%3c %0a%3c 14:14 The LORD shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace.%0a%3c %0a%3c 14:15 And the LORD said unto Moses, Wherefore criest thou unto me?%0a%3c speak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward: 14:16 But%0a%3c lift thou up thy rod, and stretch out thine hand over the sea, and%0a%3c divide it: and the children of Israel shall go on dry ground through%0a%3c the midst of the sea.%0a%3c %0a%3c 14:17 And I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and%0a%3c they shall follow them: and I will get me honour upon Pharaoh, and%0a%3c upon all his host, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen.%0a%3c %0a%3c 14:18 And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I have%0a%3c gotten me honour upon Pharaoh, upon his chariots, and upon his%0a%3c horsemen.%0a%3c %0a%3c 14:19 And the angel of God, which went before the camp of Israel,%0a%3c removed and went behind them; and the pillar of the cloud went from%0a%3c before their face, and stood behind them: 14:20 And it came between%0a%3c the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel; and it was a cloud%0a%3c and darkness to them, but it gave light by night to these: so that the%0a%3c one came not near the other all the night.%0a%3c %0a%3c 14:21 And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the LORD%0a%3c caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night, and%0a%3c made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided.%0a%3c %0a%3c 14:22 And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon%0a%3c the dry ground: and the waters were a wall unto them on their right%0a%3c hand, and on their left.%0a%3c %0a%3c 14:23 And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them to the midst%0a%3c of the sea, even all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen.%0a%3c %0a%3c 14:24 And it came to pass, that in the morning watch the LORD looked%0a%3c unto the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the%0a%3c cloud, and troubled the host of the Egyptians, 14:25 And took off%0a%3c their chariot wheels, that they drave them heavily: so that the%0a%3c Egyptians said, Let us flee from the face of Israel; for the LORD%0a%3c fighteth for them against the Egyptians.%0a%3c %0a%3c 14:26 And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the%0a%3c sea, that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians, upon their%0a%3c chariots, and upon their horsemen.%0a%3c %0a%3c 14:27 And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea%0a%3c returned to his strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians%0a%3c fled against it; and the LORD overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of%0a%3c the sea.%0a%3c %0a%3c 14:28 And the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the%0a%3c horsemen, and all the host of Pharaoh that came into the sea after%0a%3c them; there remained not so much as one of them.%0a%3c %0a%3c 14:29 But the children of Israel walked upon dry land in the midst of%0a%3c the sea; and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and%0a%3c on their left.%0a%3c %0a%3c 14:30 Thus the LORD saved Israel that day out of the hand of the%0a%3c Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea shore.%0a%3c %0a%3c 14:31 And Israel saw that great work which the LORD did upon the%0a%3c Egyptians: and the people feared the LORD, and believed the LORD, and%0a%3c his servant Moses.%0a%3c %0a%3c 15:1 Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the%0a%3c LORD, and spake, saying, I will sing unto the LORD, for he hath%0a%3c triumphed gloriously: the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the%0a%3c sea.%0a%3c %0a%3c 15:2 The LORD is my strength and song, and he is become my salvation:%0a%3c he is my God, and I will prepare him an habitation; my father's God,%0a%3c and I will exalt him.%0a%3c %0a%3c 15:3 The LORD is a man of war: the LORD is his name.%0a%3c %0a%3c 15:4 Pharaoh's chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea: his%0a%3c chosen captains also are drowned in the Red sea.%0a%3c %0a%3c 15:5 The depths have covered them: they sank into the bottom as a%0a%3c stone.%0a%3c %0a%3c 15:6 Thy right hand, O LORD, is become glorious in power: thy right%0a%3c hand, O LORD, hath dashed in pieces the enemy.%0a%3c %0a%3c 15:7 And in the greatness of thine excellency thou hast overthrown%0a%3c them that rose up against thee: thou sentest forth thy wrath, which%0a%3c consumed them as stubble.%0a%3c %0a%3c 15:8 And with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were gathered%0a%3c together, the floods stood upright as an heap, and the depths were%0a%3c congealed in the heart of the sea.%0a%3c %0a%3c 15:9 The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the%0a%3c spoil; my lust shall be satisfied upon them; I will draw my sword, my%0a%3c hand shall destroy them.%0a%3c %0a%3c 15:10 Thou didst blow with thy wind, the sea covered them: they sank%0a%3c as lead in the mighty waters.%0a%3c %0a%3c 15:11 Who is like unto thee, O LORD, among the gods? who is like thee,%0a%3c glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders?  15:12 Thou%0a%3c stretchedst out thy right hand, the earth swallowed them.%0a%3c %0a%3c 15:13 Thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people which thou hast%0a%3c redeemed: thou hast guided them in thy strength unto thy holy%0a%3c habitation.%0a%3c %0a%3c 15:14 The people shall hear, and be afraid: sorrow shall take hold on%0a%3c the inhabitants of Palestina.%0a%3c %0a%3c 15:15 Then the dukes of Edom shall be amazed; the mighty men of Moab,%0a%3c trembling shall take hold upon them; all the inhabitants of Canaan%0a%3c shall melt away.%0a%3c %0a%3c 15:16 Fear and dread shall fall upon them; by the greatness of thine%0a%3c arm they shall be as still as a stone; till thy people pass over, O%0a%3c LORD, till the people pass over, which thou hast purchased.%0a%3c %0a%3c 15:17 Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of%0a%3c thine inheritance, in the place, O LORD, which thou hast made for thee%0a%3c to dwell in, in the Sanctuary, O LORD, which thy hands have%0a%3c established.%0a%3c %0a%3c 15:18 The LORD shall reign for ever and ever.%0a%3c %0a%3c 15:19 For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his%0a%3c horsemen into the sea, and the LORD brought again the waters of the%0a%3c sea upon them; but the children of Israel went on dry land in the%0a%3c midst of the sea.%0a%3c %0a%3c 15:20 And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel%0a%3c in her hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and%0a%3c with dances.%0a%3c %0a%3c 15:21 And Miriam answered them, Sing ye to the LORD, for he hath%0a%3c triumphed gloriously; the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the%0a%3c sea.%0a%3c %0a%3c 15:22 So Moses brought Israel from the Red sea, and they went out into%0a%3c the wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness,%0a%3c and found no water.%0a%3c %0a%3c 15:23 And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the waters%0a%3c of Marah, for they were bitter: therefore the name of it was called%0a%3c Marah.%0a%3c %0a%3c 15:24 And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we%0a%3c drink?  15:25 And he cried unto the LORD; and the LORD shewed him a%0a%3c tree, which when he had cast into the waters, the waters were made%0a%3c sweet: there he made for them a statute and an ordinance, and there he%0a%3c proved them, 15:26 And said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to the%0a%3c voice of the LORD thy God, and wilt do that which is right in his%0a%3c sight, and wilt give ear to his commandments, and keep all his%0a%3c statutes, I will put none of these diseases upon thee, which I have%0a%3c brought upon the Egyptians: for I am the LORD that healeth thee.%0a%3c %0a%3c 15:27 And they came to Elim, where were twelve wells of water, and%0a%3c threescore and ten palm trees: and they encamped there by the waters.%0a%3c %0a%3c 16:1 And they took their journey from Elim, and all the congregation%0a%3c of the children of Israel came unto the wilderness of Sin, which is%0a%3c between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after%0a%3c their departing out of the land of Egypt.%0a%3c %0a%3c 16:2 And the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured%0a%3c against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness: 16:3 And the children of%0a%3c Israel said unto them, Would to God we had died by the hand of the%0a%3c LORD in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the flesh pots, and when we%0a%3c did eat bread to the full; for ye have brought us forth into this%0a%3c wilderness, to kill this whole assembly with hunger.%0a%3c %0a%3c 16:4 Then said the LORD unto Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from%0a%3c heaven for you; and the people shall go out and gather a certain rate%0a%3c every day, that I may prove them, whether they will walk in my law, or%0a%3c no.%0a%3c %0a%3c 16:5 And it shall come to pass, that on the sixth day they shall%0a%3c prepare that which they bring in; and it shall be twice as much as%0a%3c they gather daily.%0a%3c %0a%3c 16:6 And Moses and Aaron said unto all the children of Israel, At%0a%3c even, then ye shall know that the LORD hath brought you out from the%0a%3c land of Egypt: 16:7 And in the morning, then ye shall see the glory of%0a%3c the LORD; for that he heareth your murmurings against the LORD: and%0a%3c what are we, that ye murmur against us?  16:8 And Moses said, This%0a%3c shall be, when the LORD shall give you in the evening flesh to eat,%0a%3c and in the morning bread to the full; for that the LORD heareth your%0a%3c murmurings which ye murmur against him: and what are we? your%0a%3c murmurings are not against us, but against the LORD.%0a%3c %0a%3c 16:9 And Moses spake unto Aaron, Say unto all the congregation of the%0a%3c children of Israel, Come near before the LORD: for he hath heard your%0a%3c murmurings.%0a%3c %0a%3c 16:10 And it came to pass, as Aaron spake unto the whole congregation%0a%3c of the children of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness,%0a%3c and, behold, the glory of the LORD appeared in the cloud.%0a%3c %0a%3c 16:11 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 16:12 I have heard the%0a%3c murmurings of the children of Israel: speak unto them, saying, At even%0a%3c ye shall eat flesh, and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread;%0a%3c and ye shall know that I am the LORD your God.%0a%3c %0a%3c 16:13 And it came to pass, that at even the quails came up, and%0a%3c covered the camp: and in the morning the dew lay round about the host.%0a%3c %0a%3c 16:14 And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face of%0a%3c the wilderness there lay a small round thing, as small as the hoar%0a%3c frost on the ground.%0a%3c %0a%3c 16:15 And when the children of Israel saw it, they said one to%0a%3c another, It is manna: for they wist not what it was. And Moses said%0a%3c unto them, This is the bread which the LORD hath given you to eat.%0a%3c %0a%3c 16:16 This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded, Gather of it%0a%3c every man according to his eating, an omer for every man, according to%0a%3c the number of your persons; take ye every man for them which are in%0a%3c his tents.%0a%3c %0a%3c 16:17 And the children of Israel did so, and gathered, some more, some%0a%3c less.%0a%3c %0a%3c 16:18 And when they did mete it with an omer, he that gathered much%0a%3c had nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack; they%0a%3c gathered every man according to his eating.%0a%3c %0a%3c 16:19 And Moses said, Let no man leave of it till the morning.%0a%3c %0a%3c 16:20 Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto Moses; but some of them%0a%3c left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and stank: and Moses%0a%3c was wroth with them.%0a%3c %0a%3c 16:21 And they gathered it every morning, every man according to his%0a%3c eating: and when the sun waxed hot, it melted.%0a%3c %0a%3c 16:22 And it came to pass, that on the sixth day they gathered twice%0a%3c as much bread, two omers for one man: and all the rulers of the%0a%3c congregation came and told Moses.%0a%3c %0a%3c 16:23 And he said unto them, This is that which the LORD hath said, To%0a%3c morrow is the rest of the holy sabbath unto the LORD: bake that which%0a%3c ye will bake to day, and seethe that ye will seethe; and that which%0a%3c remaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the morning.%0a%3c %0a%3c 16:24 And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses bade: and it did%0a%3c not stink, neither was there any worm therein.%0a%3c %0a%3c 16:25 And Moses said, Eat that to day; for to day is a sabbath unto%0a%3c the LORD: to day ye shall not find it in the field.%0a%3c %0a%3c 16:26 Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day, which is%0a%3c the sabbath, in it there shall be none.%0a%3c %0a%3c 16:27 And it came to pass, that there went out some of the people on%0a%3c the seventh day for to gather, and they found none.%0a%3c %0a%3c 16:28 And the LORD said unto Moses, How long refuse ye to keep my%0a%3c commandments and my laws?  16:29 See, for that the LORD hath given you%0a%3c the sabbath, therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two%0a%3c days; abide ye every man in his place, let no man go out of his place%0a%3c on the seventh day.%0a%3c %0a%3c 16:30 So the people rested on the seventh day.%0a%3c %0a%3c 16:31 And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna: and it%0a%3c was like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it was like wafers%0a%3c made with honey.%0a%3c %0a%3c 16:32 And Moses said, This is the thing which the LORD commandeth,%0a%3c Fill an omer of it to be kept for your generations; that they may see%0a%3c the bread wherewith I have fed you in the wilderness, when I brought%0a%3c you forth from the land of Egypt.%0a%3c %0a%3c 16:33 And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omer full of%0a%3c manna therein, and lay it up before the LORD, to be kept for your%0a%3c generations.%0a%3c %0a%3c 16:34 As the LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the%0a%3c Testimony, to be kept.%0a%3c %0a%3c 16:35 And the children of Israel did eat manna forty years, until they%0a%3c came to a land inhabited; they did eat manna, until they came unto the%0a%3c borders of the land of Canaan.%0a%3c %0a%3c 16:36 Now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah.%0a%3c %0a%3c 17:1 And all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from%0a%3c the wilderness of Sin, after their journeys, according to the%0a%3c commandment of the LORD, and pitched in Rephidim: and there was no%0a%3c water for the people to drink.%0a%3c %0a%3c 17:2 Wherefore the people did chide with Moses, and said, Give us%0a%3c water that we may drink. And Moses said unto them, Why chide ye with%0a%3c me? wherefore do ye tempt the LORD?  17:3 And the people thirsted%0a%3c there for water; and the people murmured against Moses, and said,%0a%3c Wherefore is this that thou hast brought us up out of Egypt, to kill%0a%3c us and our children and our cattle with thirst?  17:4 And Moses cried%0a%3c unto the LORD, saying, What shall I do unto this people? they be%0a%3c almost ready to stone me.%0a%3c %0a%3c 17:5 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go on before the people, and take%0a%3c with thee of the elders of Israel; and thy rod, wherewith thou smotest%0a%3c the river, take in thine hand, and go.%0a%3c %0a%3c 17:6 Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb;%0a%3c and thou shalt smite the rock, and there shall come water out of it,%0a%3c that the people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the elders%0a%3c of Israel.%0a%3c %0a%3c 17:7 And he called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah, because%0a%3c of the chiding of the children of Israel, and because they tempted the%0a%3c LORD, saying, Is the LORD among us, or not?  17:8 Then came Amalek,%0a%3c and fought with Israel in Rephidim.%0a%3c %0a%3c 17:9 And Moses said unto Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out, fight%0a%3c with Amalek: to morrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the%0a%3c rod of God in mine hand.%0a%3c %0a%3c 17:10 So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek:%0a%3c and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill.%0a%3c %0a%3c 17:11 And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel%0a%3c prevailed: and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed.%0a%3c %0a%3c 17:12 But Moses hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it%0a%3c under him, and he sat thereon; and Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands,%0a%3c the one on the one side, and the other on the other side; and his%0a%3c hands were steady until the going down of the sun.%0a%3c %0a%3c 17:13 And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of%0a%3c the sword.%0a%3c %0a%3c 17:14 And the LORD said unto Moses, Write this for a memorial in a%0a%3c book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: for I will utterly put%0a%3c out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.%0a%3c %0a%3c 17:15 And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it%0a%3c Jehovahnissi: 17:16 For he said, Because the LORD hath sworn that the%0a%3c LORD will have war with Amalek from generation to generation.%0a%3c %0a%3c 18:1 When Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses' father in law, heard of%0a%3c all that God had done for Moses, and for Israel his people, and that%0a%3c the LORD had brought Israel out of Egypt; 18:2 Then Jethro, Moses'%0a%3c father in law, took Zipporah, Moses' wife, after he had sent her back,%0a%3c 18:3 And her two sons; of which the name of the one was Gershom; for%0a%3c he said, I have been an alien in a strange land: 18:4 And the name of%0a%3c the other was Eliezer; for the God of my father, said he, was mine%0a%3c help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh: 18:5 And Jethro,%0a%3c Moses' father in law, came with his sons and his wife unto Moses into%0a%3c the wilderness, where he encamped at the mount of God: 18:6 And he%0a%3c said unto Moses, I thy father in law Jethro am come unto thee, and thy%0a%3c wife, and her two sons with her.%0a%3c %0a%3c 18:7 And Moses went out to meet his father in law, and did obeisance,%0a%3c and kissed him; and they asked each other of their welfare; and they%0a%3c came into the tent.%0a%3c %0a%3c 18:8 And Moses told his father in law all that the LORD had done unto%0a%3c Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel's sake, and all the travail%0a%3c that had come upon them by the way, and how the LORD delivered them.%0a%3c %0a%3c 18:9 And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the LORD had done%0a%3c to Israel, whom he had delivered out of the hand of the Egyptians.%0a%3c %0a%3c 18:10 And Jethro said, Blessed be the LORD, who hath delivered you out%0a%3c of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh, who hath%0a%3c delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians.%0a%3c %0a%3c 18:11 Now I know that the LORD is greater than all gods: for in the%0a%3c thing wherein they dealt proudly he was above them.%0a%3c %0a%3c 18:12 And Jethro, Moses' father in law, took a burnt offering and%0a%3c sacrifices for God: and Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel, to%0a%3c eat bread with Moses' father in law before God.%0a%3c %0a%3c 18:13 And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge the%0a%3c people: and the people stood by Moses from the morning unto the%0a%3c evening.%0a%3c %0a%3c 18:14 And when Moses' father in law saw all that he did to the people,%0a%3c he said, What is this thing that thou doest to the people? why sittest%0a%3c thou thyself alone, and all the people stand by thee from morning unto%0a%3c even?  18:15 And Moses said unto his father in law, Because the people%0a%3c come unto me to enquire of God: 18:16 When they have a matter, they%0a%3c come unto me; and I judge between one and another, and I do make them%0a%3c know the statutes of God, and his laws.%0a%3c %0a%3c 18:17 And Moses' father in law said unto him, The thing that thou%0a%3c doest is not good.%0a%3c %0a%3c 18:18 Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people that is%0a%3c with thee: for this thing is too heavy for thee; thou art not able to%0a%3c perform it thyself alone.%0a%3c %0a%3c 18:19 Hearken now unto my voice, I will give thee counsel, and God%0a%3c shall be with thee: Be thou for the people to God-ward, that thou%0a%3c mayest bring the causes unto God: 18:20 And thou shalt teach them%0a%3c ordinances and laws, and shalt shew them the way wherein they must%0a%3c walk, and the work that they must do.%0a%3c %0a%3c 18:21 Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men, such%0a%3c as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place such over%0a%3c them, to be rulers of thousands, and rulers of hundreds, rulers of%0a%3c fifties, and rulers of tens: 18:22 And let them judge the people at%0a%3c all seasons: and it shall be, that every great matter they shall bring%0a%3c unto thee, but every small matter they shall judge: so shall it be%0a%3c easier for thyself, and they shall bear the burden with thee.%0a%3c %0a%3c 18:23 If thou shalt do this thing, and God command thee so, then thou%0a%3c shalt be able to endure, and all this people shall also go to their%0a%3c place in peace.%0a%3c %0a%3c 18:24 So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father in law, and did%0a%3c all that he had said.%0a%3c %0a%3c 18:25 And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads%0a%3c over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of%0a%3c fifties, and rulers of tens.%0a%3c %0a%3c 18:26 And they judged the people at all seasons: the hard causes they%0a%3c brought unto Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves.%0a%3c %0a%3c 18:27 And Moses let his father in law depart; and he went his way into%0a%3c his own land.%0a%3c %0a%3c 19:1 In the third month, when the children of Israel were gone forth%0a%3c out of the land of Egypt, the same day came they into the wilderness%0a%3c of Sinai.%0a%3c %0a%3c 19:2 For they were departed from Rephidim, and were come to the desert%0a%3c of Sinai, and had pitched in the wilderness; and there Israel camped%0a%3c before the mount.%0a%3c %0a%3c 19:3 And Moses went up unto God, and the LORD called unto him out of%0a%3c the mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and%0a%3c tell the children of Israel; 19:4 Ye have seen what I did unto the%0a%3c Egyptians, and how I bare you on eagles' wings, and brought you unto%0a%3c myself.%0a%3c %0a%3c 19:5 Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my%0a%3c covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all%0a%3c people: for all the earth is mine: 19:6 And ye shall be unto me a%0a%3c kingdom of priests, and an holy nation.%0a%3c %0a%3c These are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of%0a%3c Israel.%0a%3c %0a%3c 19:7 And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and laid%0a%3c before their faces all these words which the LORD commanded him.%0a%3c %0a%3c 19:8 And all the people answered together, and said, All that the LORD%0a%3c hath spoken we will do. And Moses returned the words of the people%0a%3c unto the LORD.%0a%3c %0a%3c 19:9 And the LORD said unto Moses, Lo, I come unto thee in a thick%0a%3c cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and believe%0a%3c thee for ever.%0a%3c %0a%3c And Moses told the words of the people unto the LORD.%0a%3c %0a%3c 19:10 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go unto the people, and sanctify%0a%3c them to day and to morrow, and let them wash their clothes, 19:11 And%0a%3c be ready against the third day: for the third day the LORD will come%0a%3c down in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai.%0a%3c %0a%3c 19:12 And thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about, saying,%0a%3c Take heed to yourselves, that ye go not up into the mount, or touch%0a%3c the border of it: whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to%0a%3c death: 19:13 There shall not an hand touch it, but he shall surely be%0a%3c stoned, or shot through; whether it be beast or man, it shall not%0a%3c live: when the trumpet soundeth long, they shall come up to the mount.%0a%3c %0a%3c 19:14 And Moses went down from the mount unto the people, and%0a%3c sanctified the people; and they washed their clothes.%0a%3c %0a%3c 19:15 And he said unto the people, Be ready against the third day:%0a%3c come not at your wives.%0a%3c %0a%3c 19:16 And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there%0a%3c were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and%0a%3c the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that%0a%3c was in the camp trembled.%0a%3c %0a%3c 19:17 And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with%0a%3c God; and they stood at the nether part of the mount.%0a%3c %0a%3c 19:18 And mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the LORD%0a%3c descended upon it in fire: and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke%0a%3c of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly.%0a%3c %0a%3c 19:19 And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and waxed louder%0a%3c and louder, Moses spake, and God answered him by a voice.%0a%3c %0a%3c 19:20 And the LORD came down upon mount Sinai, on the top of the%0a%3c mount: and the LORD called Moses up to the top of the mount; and Moses%0a%3c went up.%0a%3c %0a%3c 19:21 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go down, charge the people, lest%0a%3c they break through unto the LORD to gaze, and many of them perish.%0a%3c %0a%3c 19:22 And let the priests also, which come near to the LORD, sanctify%0a%3c themselves, lest the LORD break forth upon them.%0a%3c %0a%3c 19:23 And Moses said unto the LORD, The people cannot come up to mount%0a%3c Sinai: for thou chargedst us, saying, Set bounds about the mount, and%0a%3c sanctify it.%0a%3c %0a%3c 19:24 And the LORD said unto him, Away, get thee down, and thou shalt%0a%3c come up, thou, and Aaron with thee: but let not the priests and the%0a%3c people break through to come up unto the LORD, lest he break forth%0a%3c upon them.%0a%3c %0a%3c 19:25 So Moses went down unto the people, and spake unto them.%0a%3c %0a%3c 20:1 And God spake all these words, saying, 20:2 I am the LORD thy%0a%3c God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the%0a%3c house of bondage.%0a%3c %0a%3c 20:3 Thou shalt have no other gods before me.%0a%3c %0a%3c 20:4 Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness%0a%3c of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath,%0a%3c or that is in the water under the earth.%0a%3c %0a%3c 20:5 Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I%0a%3c the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the%0a%3c fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them%0a%3c that hate me; 20:6 And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love%0a%3c me, and keep my commandments.%0a%3c %0a%3c 20:7 Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain; for the%0a%3c LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.%0a%3c %0a%3c 20:8 Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.%0a%3c %0a%3c 20:9 Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work: 20:10 But the%0a%3c seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt not%0a%3c do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor%0a%3c thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy%0a%3c gates: 20:11 For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea,%0a%3c and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the%0a%3c LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.%0a%3c %0a%3c 20:12 Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon%0a%3c the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.%0a%3c %0a%3c 20:13 Thou shalt not kill.%0a%3c %0a%3c 20:14 Thou shalt not commit adultery.%0a%3c %0a%3c 20:15 Thou shalt not steal.%0a%3c %0a%3c 20:16 Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.%0a%3c %0a%3c 20:17 Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house, thou shalt not covet%0a%3c thy neighbour's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his%0a%3c ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbour's.%0a%3c %0a%3c 20:18 And all the people saw the thunderings, and the lightnings, and%0a%3c the noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and when the%0a%3c people saw it, they removed, and stood afar off.%0a%3c %0a%3c 20:19 And they said unto Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will hear:%0a%3c but let not God speak with us, lest we die.%0a%3c %0a%3c 20:20 And Moses said unto the people, Fear not: for God is come to%0a%3c prove you, and that his fear may be before your faces, that ye sin%0a%3c not.%0a%3c %0a%3c 20:21 And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near unto the%0a%3c thick darkness where God was.%0a%3c %0a%3c 20:22 And the LORD said unto Moses, Thus thou shalt say unto the%0a%3c children of Israel, Ye have seen that I have talked with you from%0a%3c heaven.%0a%3c %0a%3c 20:23 Ye shall not make with me gods of silver, neither shall ye make%0a%3c unto you gods of gold.%0a%3c %0a%3c 20:24 An altar of earth thou shalt make unto me, and shalt sacrifice%0a%3c thereon thy burnt offerings, and thy peace offerings, thy sheep, and%0a%3c thine oxen: in all places where I record my name I will come unto%0a%3c thee, and I will bless thee.%0a%3c %0a%3c 20:25 And if thou wilt make me an altar of stone, thou shalt not build%0a%3c it of hewn stone: for if thou lift up thy tool upon it, thou hast%0a%3c polluted it.%0a%3c %0a%3c 20:26 Neither shalt thou go up by steps unto mine altar, that thy%0a%3c nakedness be not discovered thereon.%0a%3c %0a%3c 21:1 Now these are the judgments which thou shalt set before them.%0a%3c %0a%3c 21:2 If thou buy an Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve: and in%0a%3c the seventh he shall go out free for nothing.%0a%3c %0a%3c 21:3 If he came in by himself, he shall go out by himself: if he were%0a%3c married, then his wife shall go out with him.%0a%3c %0a%3c 21:4 If his master have given him a wife, and she have born him sons%0a%3c or daughters; the wife and her children shall be her master's, and he%0a%3c shall go out by himself.%0a%3c %0a%3c 21:5 And if the servant shall plainly say, I love my master, my wife,%0a%3c and my children; I will not go out free: 21:6 Then his master shall%0a%3c bring him unto the judges; he shall also bring him to the door, or%0a%3c unto the door post; and his master shall bore his ear through with an%0a%3c aul; and he shall serve him for ever.%0a%3c %0a%3c 21:7 And if a man sell his daughter to be a maidservant, she shall not%0a%3c go out as the menservants do.%0a%3c %0a%3c 21:8 If she please not her master, who hath betrothed her to himself,%0a%3c then shall he let her be redeemed: to sell her unto a strange nation%0a%3c he shall have no power, seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her.%0a%3c %0a%3c 21:9 And if he have betrothed her unto his son, he shall deal with her%0a%3c after the manner of daughters.%0a%3c %0a%3c 21:10 If he take him another wife; her food, her raiment, and her duty%0a%3c of marriage, shall he not diminish.%0a%3c %0a%3c 21:11 And if he do not these three unto her, then shall she go out%0a%3c free without money.%0a%3c %0a%3c 21:12 He that smiteth a man, so that he die, shall be surely put to%0a%3c death.%0a%3c %0a%3c 21:13 And if a man lie not in wait, but God deliver him into his hand;%0a%3c then I will appoint thee a place whither he shall flee.%0a%3c %0a%3c 21:14 But if a man come presumptuously upon his neighbour, to slay him%0a%3c with guile; thou shalt take him from mine altar, that he may die.%0a%3c %0a%3c 21:15 And he that smiteth his father, or his mother, shall be surely%0a%3c put to death.%0a%3c %0a%3c 21:16 And he that stealeth a man, and selleth him, or if he be found%0a%3c in his hand, he shall surely be put to death.%0a%3c %0a%3c 21:17 And he that curseth his father, or his mother, shall surely be%0a%3c put to death.%0a%3c %0a%3c 21:18 And if men strive together, and one smite another with a stone,%0a%3c or with his fist, and he die not, but keepeth his bed: 21:19 If he%0a%3c rise again, and walk abroad upon his staff, then shall he that smote%0a%3c him be quit: only he shall pay for the loss of his time, and shall%0a%3c cause him to be thoroughly healed.%0a%3c %0a%3c 21:20 And if a man smite his servant, or his maid, with a rod, and he%0a%3c die under his hand; he shall be surely punished.%0a%3c %0a%3c 21:21 Notwithstanding, if he continue a day or two, he shall not be%0a%3c punished: for he is his money.%0a%3c %0a%3c 21:22 If men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit%0a%3c depart from her, and yet no mischief follow: he shall be surely%0a%3c punished, according as the woman's husband will lay upon him;

for he will%0a%3c not pardon your transgressions: for my name is in him.%0a%3c %0a%3c 23:22 But if thou shalt indeed obey his voice, and do all that I%0a%3c speak; then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies, and an adversary%0a%3c unto thine adversaries.%0a%3c %0a%3c 23:23 For mine Angel shall go before thee, and bring thee in unto the%0a%3c Amorites, and the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites,%0a%3c the Hivites, and the Jebusites: and I will cut them off.%0a%3c %0a%3c 23:24 Thou shalt not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do%0a%3c after their works: but thou shalt utterly overthrow them, and quite%0a%3c break down their images.%0a%3c %0a%3c 23:25 And ye shall serve the LORD your God, and he shall bless thy%0a%3c bread, and thy water; and I will take sickness away from the midst of%0a%3c thee.%0a%3c %0a%3c 23:26 There shall nothing cast their young, nor be barren, in thy%0a%3c land: the number of thy days I will fulfil.%0a%3c %0a%3c 23:27 I will send my fear before thee, and will destroy all the people%0a%3c to whom thou shalt come, and I will make all thine enemies turn their%0a%3c backs unto thee.%0a%3c %0a%3c 23:28 And I will send hornets before thee, which shall drive out the%0a%3c Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite, from before thee.%0a%3c %0a%3c 23:29 I will not drive them out from before thee in one year;

and shalt wave them for%0a%3c a wave offering before the LORD.%0a%3c %0a%3c 29:25 And thou shalt receive them of their hands, and burn them upon%0a%3c the altar for a burnt offering, for a sweet savour before the LORD: it%0a%3c is an offering made by fire unto the LORD.%0a%3c %0a%3c 29:26 And thou shalt take the breast of the ram of Aaron's%0a%3c consecration, and wave it for a wave offering before the LORD: and it%0a%3c shall be thy part.%0a%3c %0a%3c 29:27 And thou shalt sanctify the breast of the wave offering, and the%0a%3c shoulder of the heave offering, which is waved, and which is heaved%0a%3c up, of the ram of the consecration, even of that which is for Aaron,%0a%3c and of that which is for his sons: 29:28 And it shall be Aaron's and%0a%3c his sons' by a statute for ever from the children of Israel: for it is%0a%3c an heave offering: and it shall be an heave offering from the children%0a%3c of Israel of the sacrifice of their peace offerings, even their heave%0a%3c offering unto the LORD.%0a%3c %0a%3c 29:29 And the holy garments of Aaron shall be his sons' after him, to%0a%3c be anointed therein, and to be consecrated in them.%0a%3c %0a%3c 29:30 And that son that is priest in his stead shall put them on seven%0a%3c days, when he cometh into the tabernacle of the congregation to%0a%3c minister in the holy place.%0a%3c %0a%3c 29:31 And thou shalt take the ram of the consecration, and seethe his%0a%3c flesh in the holy place.%0a%3c %0a%3c 29:32 And Aaron and his sons shall eat the flesh of the ram, and the%0a%3c bread that is in the basket by the door of the tabernacle of the%0a%3c congregation.%0a%3c %0a%3c 29:33 And they shall eat those things wherewith the atonement was%0a%3c made, to consecrate and to sanctify them: but a stranger shall not eat%0a%3c thereof, because they are holy.%0a%3c %0a%3c 29:34 And if ought of the flesh of the consecrations, or of the bread,%0a%3c remain unto the morning, then thou shalt burn the remainder with fire:%0a%3c it shall not be eaten, because it is holy.%0a%3c %0a%3c 29:35 And thus shalt thou do unto Aaron, and to his sons, according to%0a%3c all things which I have commanded thee: seven days shalt thou%0a%3c consecrate them.%0a%3c %0a%3c 29:36 And thou shalt offer every day a bullock for a sin offering for%0a%3c atonement: and thou shalt cleanse the altar, when thou hast made an%0a%3c atonement for it, and thou shalt anoint it, to sanctify it.%0a%3c %0a%3c 29:37 Seven days thou shalt make an atonement for the altar, and%0a%3c sanctify it; and it shall be an altar most holy: whatsoever toucheth%0a%3c the altar shall be holy.%0a%3c %0a%3c 29:38 Now this is that which thou shalt offer upon the altar; two%0a%3c lambs of the first year day by day continually.%0a%3c %0a%3c 29:39 The one lamb thou shalt offer in the morning; and the other lamb%0a%3c thou shalt offer at even: 29:40 And with the one lamb a tenth deal of%0a%3c flour mingled with the fourth part of an hin of beaten oil; and the%0a%3c fourth part of an hin of wine for a drink offering.%0a%3c %0a%3c 29:41 And the other lamb thou shalt offer at even, and shalt do%0a%3c thereto according to the meat offering of the morning, and according%0a%3c to the drink offering thereof, for a sweet savour, an offering made by%0a%3c fire unto the LORD.%0a%3c %0a%3c 29:42 This shall be a continual burnt offering throughout your%0a%3c generations at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before%0a%3c the LORD: where I will meet you, to speak there unto thee.%0a%3c %0a%3c 29:43 And there I will meet with the children of Israel, and the%0a%3c tabernacle shall be sanctified by my glory.%0a%3c %0a%3c 29:44 And I will sanctify the tabernacle of the congregation, and the%0a%3c altar: I will sanctify also both Aaron and his sons, to minister to me%0a%3c in the priest's office.%0a%3c %0a%3c 29:45 And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will be their%0a%3c God.%0a%3c %0a%3c 29:46 And they shall know that I am the LORD their God, that brought%0a%3c them forth out of the land of Egypt, that I may dwell among them: I am%0a%3c the LORD their God.%0a%3c %0a%3c 30:1 And thou shalt make an altar to burn incense upon: of shittim%0a%3c wood shalt thou make it.%0a%3c %0a%3c 30:2 A cubit shall be the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth%0a%3c thereof; foursquare shall it be: and two cubits shall be the height%0a%3c thereof: the horns thereof shall be of the same.%0a%3c %0a%3c 30:3 And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, the top thereof, and%0a%3c the sides thereof round about, and the horns thereof; and thou shalt%0a%3c make unto it a crown of gold round about.%0a%3c %0a%3c 30:4 And two golden rings shalt thou make to it under the crown of it,%0a%3c by the two corners thereof, upon the two sides of it shalt thou make%0a%3c it; and they shall be for places for the staves to bear it withal.%0a%3c %0a%3c 30:5 And thou shalt make the staves of shittim wood, and overlay them%0a%3c with gold.%0a%3c %0a%3c 30:6 And thou shalt put it before the vail that is by the ark of the%0a%3c testimony, before the mercy seat that is over the testimony, where I%0a%3c will meet with thee.%0a%3c %0a%3c 30:7 And Aaron shall burn thereon sweet incense every morning: when he%0a%3c dresseth the lamps, he shall burn incense upon it.%0a%3c %0a%3c 30:8 And when Aaron lighteth the lamps at even, he shall burn incense%0a%3c upon it, a perpetual incense before the LORD throughout your%0a%3c generations.%0a%3c %0a%3c 30:9 Ye shall offer no strange incense thereon, nor burnt sacrifice,%0a%3c nor meat offering; neither shall ye pour drink offering thereon.%0a%3c %0a%3c 30:10 And Aaron shall make an atonement upon the horns of it once in a%0a%3c year with the blood of the sin offering of atonements: once in the%0a%3c year shall he make atonement upon it throughout your generations: it%0a%3c is most holy unto the LORD.%0a%3c %0a%3c 30:11 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 30:12 When thou takest%0a%3c the sum of the children of Israel after their number, then shall they%0a%3c give every man a ransom for his soul unto the LORD, when thou%0a%3c numberest them; that there be no plague among them, when thou%0a%3c numberest them.%0a%3c %0a%3c 30:13 This they shall give, every one that passeth among them that are%0a%3c numbered, half a shekel after the shekel of the sanctuary: (a shekel%0a%3c is twenty gerahs:) an half shekel shall be the offering of the LORD.%0a%3c %0a%3c 30:14 Every one that passeth among them that are numbered, from twenty%0a%3c years old and above, shall give an offering unto the LORD.%0a%3c %0a%3c 30:15 The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less%0a%3c than half a shekel, when they give an offering unto the LORD, to make%0a%3c an atonement for your souls.%0a%3c %0a%3c 30:16 And thou shalt take the atonement money of the children of%0a%3c Israel, and shalt appoint it for the service of the tabernacle of the%0a%3c congregation; that it may be a memorial unto the children of Israel%0a%3c before the LORD, to make an atonement for your souls.%0a%3c %0a%3c 30:17 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 30:18 Thou shalt also%0a%3c make a laver of brass, and his foot also of brass, to wash withal: and%0a%3c thou shalt put it between the tabernacle of the congregation and the%0a%3c altar, and thou shalt put water therein.%0a%3c %0a%3c 30:19 For Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet%0a%3c thereat: 30:20 When they go into the tabernacle of the congregation,%0a%3c they shall wash with water, that they die not; or when they come near%0a%3c to the altar to minister, to burn offering made by fire unto the LORD:%0a%3c 30:21 So they shall wash their hands and their feet, that they die%0a%3c not: and it shall be a statute for ever to them, even to him and to%0a%3c his seed throughout their generations.%0a%3c %0a%3c 30:22 Moreover the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 30:23 Take thou also%0a%3c unto thee principal spices, of pure myrrh five hundred shekels, and of%0a%3c sweet cinnamon half so much, even two hundred and fifty shekels, and%0a%3c of sweet calamus two hundred and fifty shekels, 30:24 And of cassia%0a%3c five hundred shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, and of oil%0a%3c olive an hin: 30:25 And thou shalt make it an oil of holy ointment, an%0a%3c ointment compound after the art of the apothecary: it shall be an holy%0a%3c anointing oil.%0a%3c %0a%3c 30:26 And thou shalt anoint the tabernacle of the congregation%0a%3c therewith, and the ark of the testimony, 30:27 And the table and all%0a%3c his vessels, and the candlestick and his vessels, and the altar of%0a%3c incense, 30:28 And the altar of burnt offering with all his vessels,%0a%3c and the laver and his foot.%0a%3c %0a%3c 30:29 And thou shalt sanctify them, that they may be most holy:%0a%3c whatsoever toucheth them shall be holy.%0a%3c %0a%3c 30:30 And thou shalt anoint Aaron and his sons, and consecrate them,%0a%3c that they may minister unto me in the priest's office.%0a%3c %0a%3c 30:31 And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, This%0a%3c shall be an holy anointing oil unto me throughout your generations.%0a%3c %0a%3c 30:32 Upon man's flesh shall it not be poured, neither shall ye make%0a%3c any other like it, after the composition of it: it is holy, and it%0a%3c shall be holy unto you.%0a%3c %0a%3c 30:33 Whosoever compoundeth any like it, or whosoever putteth any of%0a%3c it upon a stranger, shall even be cut off from his people.%0a%3c %0a%3c 30:34 And the LORD said unto Moses, Take unto thee sweet spices,%0a%3c stacte, and onycha, and galbanum; these sweet spices with pure%0a%3c frankincense: of each shall there be a like weight: 30:35 And thou%0a%3c shalt make it a perfume, a confection after the art of the apothecary,%0a%3c tempered together, pure and holy: 30:36 And thou shalt beat some of it%0a%3c very small, and put of it before the testimony in the tabernacle of%0a%3c the congregation, where I will meet with thee: it shall be unto you%0a%3c most holy.%0a%3c %0a%3c 30:37 And as for the perfume which thou shalt make, ye shall not make%0a%3c to yourselves according to the composition thereof: it shall be unto%0a%3c thee holy for the LORD.%0a%3c %0a%3c 30:38 Whosoever shall make like unto that, to smell thereto, shall%0a%3c even be cut off from his people.%0a%3c %0a%3c 31:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 31:2 See, I have called by%0a%3c name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah:%0a%3c 31:3 And I have filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, and in%0a%3c understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship,%0a%3c 31:4 To devise cunning works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in%0a%3c brass, 31:5 And in cutting of stones, to set them, and in carving of%0a%3c timber, to work in all manner of workmanship.%0a%3c %0a%3c 31:6 And I, behold, I have given with him Aholiab, the son of%0a%3c Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan: and in the hearts of all that are wise%0a%3c hearted I have put wisdom, that they may make all that I have%0a%3c commanded thee; 31:7 The tabernacle of the congregation, and the ark%0a%3c of the testimony, and the mercy seat that is thereupon, and all the%0a%3c furniture of the tabernacle, 31:8 And the table and his furniture, and%0a%3c the pure candlestick with all his furniture, and the altar of incense,%0a%3c 31:9 And the altar of burnt offering with all his furniture, and the%0a%3c laver and his foot, 31:10 And the cloths of service, and the holy%0a%3c garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to%0a%3c minister in the priest's office, 31:11 And the anointing oil, and%0a%3c sweet incense for the holy place: according to all that I have%0a%3c commanded thee shall they do.%0a%3c %0a%3c 31:12 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 31:13 Speak thou also%0a%3c unto the children of Israel, saying, Verily my sabbaths ye shall keep:%0a%3c for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that%0a%3c ye may know that I am the LORD that doth sanctify you.%0a%3c %0a%3c 31:14 Ye shall keep the sabbath therefore; for it is holy unto you:%0a%3c every one that defileth it shall surely be put to death: for whosoever%0a%3c doeth any work therein, that soul shall be cut off from among his%0a%3c people.%0a%3c %0a%3c 31:15 Six days may work be done; but in the seventh is the sabbath of%0a%3c rest, holy to the LORD: whosoever doeth any work in the sabbath day,%0a%3c he shall surely be put to death.%0a%3c %0a%3c 31:16 Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to%0a%3c observe the sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual%0a%3c covenant.%0a%3c %0a%3c 31:17 It is a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever: for%0a%3c in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he%0a%3c rested, and was refreshed.%0a%3c %0a%3c 31:18 And he gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communing%0a%3c with him upon mount Sinai, two tables of testimony, tables of stone,%0a%3c written with the finger of God.%0a%3c %0a%3c 32:1 And when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down out of%0a%3c the mount, the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron, and%0a%3c said unto him, Up, make us gods, which shall go before us; for as for%0a%3c this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we%0a%3c wot not what is become of him.%0a%3c %0a%3c 32:2 And Aaron said unto them, Break off the golden earrings, which%0a%3c are in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters,%0a%3c and bring them unto me.%0a%3c %0a%3c 32:3 And all the people brake off the golden earrings which were in%0a%3c their ears, and brought them unto Aaron.%0a%3c %0a%3c 32:4 And he received them at their hand, and fashioned it with a%0a%3c graving tool, after he had made it a molten calf: and they said, These%0a%3c be thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.%0a%3c %0a%3c 32:5 And when Aaron saw it, he built an altar before it; and Aaron%0a%3c made proclamation, and said, To morrow is a feast to the LORD.%0a%3c %0a%3c 32:6 And they rose up early on the morrow, and offered burnt%0a%3c offerings, and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat%0a%3c and to drink, and rose up to play.%0a%3c %0a%3c 32:7 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go, get thee down; for thy people,%0a%3c which thou broughtest out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted%0a%3c themselves: 32:8 They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I%0a%3c commanded them: they have made them a molten calf, and have worshipped%0a%3c it, and have sacrificed thereunto, and said, These be thy gods, O%0a%3c Israel, which have brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.%0a%3c %0a%3c 32:9 And the LORD said unto Moses, I have seen this people, and,%0a%3c behold, it is a stiffnecked people: 32:10 Now therefore let me alone,%0a%3c that my wrath may wax hot against them, and that I may consume them:%0a%3c and I will make of thee a great nation.%0a%3c %0a%3c 32:11 And Moses besought the LORD his God, and said, LORD, why doth%0a%3c thy wrath wax hot against thy people, which thou hast brought forth%0a%3c out of the land of Egypt with great power, and with a mighty hand?%0a%3c 32:12 Wherefore should the Egyptians speak, and say, For mischief did%0a%3c he bring them out, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them%0a%3c from the face of the earth? Turn from thy fierce wrath, and repent of%0a%3c this evil against thy people.%0a%3c %0a%3c 32:13 Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, to whom thou%0a%3c swarest by thine own self, and saidst unto them, I will multiply your%0a%3c seed as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken of%0a%3c will I give unto your seed, and they shall inherit it for ever.%0a%3c %0a%3c 32:14 And the LORD repented of the evil which he thought to do unto%0a%3c his people.%0a%3c %0a%3c 32:15 And Moses turned, and went down from the mount, and the two%0a%3c tables of the testimony were in his hand: the tables were written on%0a%3c both their sides; on the one side and on the other were they written.%0a%3c %0a%3c 32:16 And the tables were the work of God, and the writing was the%0a%3c writing of God, graven upon the tables.%0a%3c %0a%3c 32:17 And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted,%0a%3c he said unto Moses, There is a noise of war in the camp.%0a%3c %0a%3c 32:18 And he said, It is not the voice of them that shout for mastery,%0a%3c neither is it the voice of them that cry for being overcome: but the%0a%3c noise of them that sing do I hear.%0a%3c %0a%3c 32:19 And it came to pass, as soon as he came nigh unto the camp, that%0a%3c he saw the calf, and the dancing: and Moses' anger waxed hot, and he%0a%3c cast the tables out of his hands, and brake them beneath the mount.%0a%3c %0a%3c 32:20 And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt it in the%0a%3c fire, and ground it to powder, and strawed it upon the water, and made%0a%3c the children of Israel drink of it.%0a%3c %0a%3c 32:21 And Moses said unto Aaron, What did this people unto thee, that%0a%3c thou hast brought so great a sin upon them?  32:22 And Aaron said, Let%0a%3c not the anger of my lord wax hot: thou knowest the people, that they%0a%3c are set on mischief.%0a%3c %0a%3c 32:23 For they said unto me, Make us gods, which shall go before us:%0a%3c for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of%0a%3c Egypt, we wot not what is become of him.%0a%3c %0a%3c 32:24 And I said unto them, Whosoever hath any gold, let them break it%0a%3c off. So they gave it me: then I cast it into the fire, and there came%0a%3c out this calf.%0a%3c %0a%3c 32:25 And when Moses saw that the people were naked; (for Aaron had%0a%3c made them naked unto their shame among their enemies:) 32:26 Then%0a%3c Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Who is on the LORD's%0a%3c side? let him come unto me. And all the sons of Levi gathered%0a%3c themselves together unto him.%0a%3c %0a%3c 32:27 And he said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Put%0a%3c every man his sword by his side, and go in and out from gate to gate%0a%3c throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his%0a%3c companion, and every man his neighbour.%0a%3c %0a%3c 32:28 And the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses: and%0a%3c there fell of the people that day about three thousand men.%0a%3c %0a%3c 32:29 For Moses had said, Consecrate yourselves today to the LORD,%0a%3c even every man upon his son, and upon his brother; that he may bestow%0a%3c upon you a blessing this day.%0a%3c %0a%3c 32:30 And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses said unto the%0a%3c people, Ye have sinned a great sin: and now I will go up unto the%0a%3c LORD; peradventure I shall make an atonement for your sin.%0a%3c %0a%3c 32:31 And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, Oh, this people have%0a%3c sinned a great sin, and have made them gods of gold.%0a%3c %0a%3c 32:32 Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin--; and if not, blot me,%0a%3c I pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast written.%0a%3c %0a%3c 32:33 And the LORD said unto Moses, Whosoever hath sinned against me,%0a%3c him will I blot out of my book.%0a%3c %0a%3c 32:34 Therefore now go, lead the people unto the place of which I have%0a%3c spoken unto thee: behold, mine Angel shall go before thee:%0a%3c nevertheless in the day when I visit I will visit their sin upon them.%0a%3c %0a%3c 32:35 And the LORD plagued the people, because they made the calf,%0a%3c which Aaron made.%0a%3c %0a%3c 33:1 And the LORD said unto Moses, Depart, and go up hence, thou and%0a%3c the people which thou hast brought up out of the land of Egypt, unto%0a%3c the land which I sware unto Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying,%0a%3c Unto thy seed will I give it: 33:2 And I will send an angel before%0a%3c thee; and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the%0a%3c Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite: 33:3 Unto a%0a%3c land flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go up in the midst of%0a%3c thee; for thou art a stiffnecked people: lest I consume thee in the%0a%3c way.%0a%3c %0a%3c 33:4 And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned: and%0a%3c no man did put on him his ornaments.%0a%3c %0a%3c 33:5 For the LORD had said unto Moses, Say unto the children of%0a%3c Israel, Ye are a stiffnecked people: I will come up into the midst of%0a%3c thee in a moment, and consume thee: therefore now put off thy%0a%3c ornaments from thee, that I may know what to do unto thee.%0a%3c %0a%3c 33:6 And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments%0a%3c by the mount Horeb.%0a%3c %0a%3c 33:7 And Moses took the tabernacle, and pitched it without the camp,%0a%3c afar off from the camp, and called it the Tabernacle of the%0a%3c congregation. And it came to pass, that every one which sought the%0a%3c LORD went out unto the tabernacle of the congregation, which was%0a%3c without the camp.%0a%3c %0a%3c 33:8 And it came to pass, when Moses went out unto the tabernacle,%0a%3c that all the people rose up, and stood every man at his tent door, and%0a%3c looked after Moses, until he was gone into the tabernacle.%0a%3c %0a%3c 33:9 And it came to pass, as Moses entered into the tabernacle, the%0a%3c cloudy pillar descended, and stood at the door of the tabernacle, and%0a%3c the Lord talked with Moses.%0a%3c %0a%3c 33:10 And all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand at the tabernacle%0a%3c door: and all the people rose up and worshipped, every man in his tent%0a%3c door.%0a%3c %0a%3c 33:11 And the LORD spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh%0a%3c unto his friend. And he turned again into the camp: but his servant%0a%3c Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, departed not out of the%0a%3c tabernacle.%0a%3c %0a%3c 33:12 And Moses said unto the LORD, See, thou sayest unto me, Bring up%0a%3c this people: and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt send with%0a%3c me. Yet thou hast said, I know thee by name, and thou hast also found%0a%3c grace in my sight.%0a%3c %0a%3c 33:13 Now therefore, I pray thee, if I have found grace in thy sight,%0a%3c shew me now thy way, that I may know thee, that I may find grace in%0a%3c thy sight: and consider that this nation is thy people.%0a%3c %0a%3c 33:14 And he said, My presence shall go with thee, and I will give%0a%3c thee rest.%0a%3c %0a%3c 33:15 And he said unto him, If thy presence go not with me, carry us%0a%3c not up hence.%0a%3c %0a%3c 33:16 For wherein shall it be known here that I and thy people have%0a%3c found grace in thy sight? is it not in that thou goest with us? so%0a%3c shall we be separated, I and thy people, from all the people that are%0a%3c upon the face of the earth.%0a%3c %0a%3c 33:17 And the LORD said unto Moses, I will do this thing also that%0a%3c thou hast spoken: for thou hast found grace in my sight, and I know%0a%3c thee by name.%0a%3c %0a%3c 33:18 And he said, I beseech thee, shew me thy glory.%0a%3c %0a%3c 33:19 And he said, I will make all my goodness pass before thee, and I%0a%3c will proclaim the name of the LORD before thee; and will be gracious%0a%3c to whom I will be gracious, and will shew mercy on whom I will shew%0a%3c mercy.%0a%3c %0a%3c 33:20 And he said, Thou canst not see my face: for there shall no man%0a%3c see me, and live.%0a%3c %0a%3c 33:21 And the LORD said, Behold, there is a place by me, and thou%0a%3c shalt stand upon a rock: 33:22 And it shall come to pass, while my%0a%3c glory passeth by, that I will put thee in a clift of the rock, and%0a%3c will cover thee with my hand while I pass by: 33:23 And I will take%0a%3c away mine hand, and thou shalt see my back parts: but my face shall%0a%3c not be seen.%0a%3c %0a%3c 34:1 And the LORD said unto Moses, Hew thee two tables of stone like%0a%3c unto the first: and I will write upon these tables the words that were%0a%3c in the first tables, which thou brakest.%0a%3c %0a%3c 34:2 And be ready in the morning, and come up in the morning unto%0a%3c mount Sinai, and present thyself there to me in the top of the mount.%0a%3c %0a%3c 34:3 And no man shall come up with thee, neither let any man be seen%0a%3c throughout all the mount; neither let the flocks nor herds feed before%0a%3c that mount.%0a%3c %0a%3c 34:4 And he hewed two tables of stone like unto the first; and Moses%0a%3c rose up early in the morning, and went up unto mount Sinai, as the%0a%3c LORD had commanded him, and took in his hand the two tables of stone.%0a%3c %0a%3c 34:5 And the LORD descended in the cloud, and stood with him there,%0a%3c and proclaimed the name of the LORD.%0a%3c %0a%3c 34:6 And the LORD passed by before him, and proclaimed, The LORD, The%0a%3c LORD God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in%0a%3c goodness and truth, 34:7 Keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving%0a%3c iniquity and transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear%0a%3c the guilty; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children,%0a%3c and upon the children's children, unto the third and to the fourth%0a%3c generation.%0a%3c %0a%3c 34:8 And Moses made haste, and bowed his head toward the earth, and%0a%3c worshipped.%0a%3c %0a%3c 34:9 And he said, If now I have found grace in thy sight, O LORD, let%0a%3c my LORD, I pray thee, go among us; for it is a stiffnecked people; and%0a%3c pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for thine inheritance.%0a%3c %0a%3c 34:10 And he said, Behold, I make a covenant: before all thy people I%0a%3c will do marvels, such as have not been done in all the earth, nor in%0a%3c any nation: and all the people among which thou art shall see the work%0a%3c of the LORD: for it is a terrible thing that I will do with thee.%0a%3c %0a%3c 34:11 Observe thou that which I command thee this day: behold, I drive%0a%3c out before thee the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and%0a%3c the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite.%0a%3c %0a%3c 34:12 Take heed to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with the%0a%3c inhabitants of the land whither thou goest, lest it be for a snare in%0a%3c the midst of thee: 34:13 But ye shall destroy their altars, break%0a%3c their images, and cut down their groves: 34:14 For thou shalt worship%0a%3c no other god: for the LORD, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God:%0a%3c 34:15 Lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and%0a%3c they go a whoring after their gods, and do sacrifice unto their gods,%0a%3c and one call thee, and thou eat of his sacrifice; 34:16 And thou take%0a%3c of their daughters unto thy sons, and their daughters go a whoring%0a%3c after their gods, and make thy sons go a whoring after their gods.%0a%3c %0a%3c 34:17 Thou shalt make thee no molten gods.%0a%3c %0a%3c 34:18 The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep. Seven days thou%0a%3c shalt eat unleavened bread, as I commanded thee, in the time of the%0a%3c month Abib: for in the month Abib thou camest out from Egypt.%0a%3c %0a%3c 34:19 All that openeth the matrix is mine; and every firstling among%0a%3c thy cattle, whether ox or sheep, that is male.%0a%3c %0a%3c 34:20 But the firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb: and%0a%3c if thou redeem him not, then shalt thou break his neck. All the%0a%3c firstborn of thy sons thou shalt redeem. And none shall appear before%0a%3c me empty.%0a%3c %0a%3c 34:21 Six days thou shalt work, but on the seventh day thou shalt%0a%3c rest: in earing time and in harvest thou shalt rest.%0a%3c %0a%3c 34:22 And thou shalt observe the feast of weeks, of the firstfruits of%0a%3c wheat harvest, and the feast of ingathering at the year's end.%0a%3c %0a%3c 34:23 Thrice in the year shall all your menchildren appear before the%0a%3c LORD God, the God of Israel.%0a%3c %0a%3c 34:24 For I will cast out the nations before thee, and enlarge thy%0a%3c borders: neither shall any man desire thy land, when thou shalt go up%0a%3c to appear before the LORD thy God thrice in the year.%0a%3c %0a%3c 34:25 Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven;%0a%3c neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left unto%0a%3c the morning.%0a%3c %0a%3c 34:26 The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring unto%0a%3c the house of the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his%0a%3c mother's milk.%0a%3c %0a%3c 34:27 And the LORD said unto Moses, Write thou these words: for after%0a%3c the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with thee and with%0a%3c Israel.%0a%3c %0a%3c 34:28 And he was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights; he%0a%3c did neither eat bread, nor drink water. And he wrote upon the tables%0a%3c the words of the covenant, the ten commandments.%0a%3c %0a%3c 34:29 And it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai with%0a%3c the two tables of testimony in Moses' hand, when he came down from the%0a%3c mount, that Moses wist not that the skin of his face shone while he%0a%3c talked with him.%0a%3c %0a%3c 34:30 And when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold,%0a%3c the skin of his face shone; and they were afraid to come nigh him.%0a%3c %0a%3c 34:31 And Moses called unto them; and Aaron and all the rulers of the%0a%3c congregation returned unto him: and Moses talked with them.%0a%3c %0a%3c 34:32 And afterward all the children of Israel came nigh: and he gave%0a%3c them in commandment all that the LORD had spoken with him in mount%0a%3c Sinai.%0a%3c %0a%3c 34:33 And till Moses had done speaking with them, he put a vail on his%0a%3c face.%0a%3c %0a%3c 34:34 But when Moses went in before the LORD to speak with him, he%0a%3c took the vail off, until he came out. And he came out, and spake unto%0a%3c the children of Israel that which he was commanded.%0a%3c %0a%3c 34:35 And the children of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the skin%0a%3c of Moses' face shone: and Moses put the vail upon his face again,%0a%3c until he went in to speak with him.%0a%3c %0a%3c 35:1 And Moses gathered all the congregation of the children of Israel%0a%3c together, and said unto them, These are the words which the LORD hath%0a%3c commanded, that ye should do them.%0a%3c %0a%3c 35:2 Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day there shall%0a%3c be to you an holy day, a sabbath of rest to the LORD: whosoever doeth%0a%3c work therein shall be put to death.%0a%3c %0a%3c 35:3 Ye shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations upon the%0a%3c sabbath day.%0a%3c %0a%3c 35:4 And Moses spake unto all the congregation of the children of%0a%3c Israel, saying, This is the thing which the LORD commanded, saying,%0a%3c 35:5 Take ye from among you an offering unto the LORD: whosoever is of%0a%3c a willing heart, let him bring it, an offering of the LORD; gold, and%0a%3c silver, and brass, 35:6 And blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine%0a%3c linen, and goats' hair, 35:7 And rams' skins dyed red, and badgers'%0a%3c skins, and shittim wood, 35:8 And oil for the light, and spices for%0a%3c anointing oil, and for the sweet incense, 35:9 And onyx stones, and%0a%3c stones to be set for the ephod, and for the breastplate.%0a%3c %0a%3c 35:10 And every wise hearted among you shall come, and make all that%0a%3c the LORD hath commanded; 35:11 The tabernacle, his tent, and his%0a%3c covering, his taches, and his boards, his bars, his pillars, and his%0a%3c sockets, 35:12 The ark, and the staves thereof, with the mercy seat,%0a%3c and the vail of the covering, 35:13 The table, and his staves, and all%0a%3c his vessels, and the shewbread, 35:14 The candlestick also for the%0a%3c light, and his furniture, and his lamps, with the oil for the light,%0a%3c 35:15 And the incense altar, and his staves, and the anointing oil,%0a%3c and the sweet incense, and the hanging for the door at the entering in%0a%3c of the tabernacle, 35:16 The altar of burnt offering, with his brasen%0a%3c grate, his staves, and all his vessels, the laver and his foot, 35:17%0a%3c The hangings of the court, his pillars, and their sockets, and the%0a%3c hanging for the door of the court, 35:18 The pins of the tabernacle,%0a%3c and the pins of the court, and their cords, 35:19 The cloths of%0a%3c service, to do service in the holy place, the holy garments for Aaron%0a%3c the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest's%0a%3c office.%0a%3c %0a%3c 35:20 And all the congregation of the children of Israel departed from%0a%3c the presence of Moses.%0a%3c %0a%3c 35:21 And they came, every one whose heart stirred him up, and every%0a%3c one whom his spirit made willing, and they brought the LORD's offering%0a%3c to the work of the tabernacle of the congregation, and for all his%0a%3c service, and for the holy garments.%0a%3c %0a%3c 35:22 And they came, both men and women, as many as were willing%0a%3c hearted, and brought bracelets, and earrings, and rings, and tablets,%0a%3c all jewels of gold: and every man that offered offered an offering of%0a%3c gold unto the LORD.%0a%3c %0a%3c 35:23 And every man, with whom was found blue, and purple, and%0a%3c scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' hair, and red skins of rams, and%0a%3c badgers' skins, brought them.%0a%3c %0a%3c 35:24 Every one that did offer an offering of silver and brass brought%0a%3c the LORD's offering: and every man, with whom was found shittim wood%0a%3c for any work of the service, brought it.%0a%3c %0a%3c 35:25 And all the women that were wise hearted did spin with their%0a%3c hands, and brought that which they had spun, both of blue, and of%0a%3c purple, and of scarlet, and of fine linen.%0a%3c %0a%3c 35:26 And all the women whose heart stirred them up in wisdom spun%0a%3c goats' hair.%0a%3c %0a%3c 35:27 And the rulers brought onyx stones, and stones to be set, for%0a%3c the ephod, and for the breastplate; 35:28 And spice, and oil for the%0a%3c light, and for the anointing oil, and for the sweet incense.%0a%3c %0a%3c 35:29 The children of Israel brought a willing offering unto the LORD,%0a%3c every man and woman, whose heart made them willing to bring for all%0a%3c manner of work, which the LORD had commanded to be made by the hand of%0a%3c Moses.%0a%3c %0a%3c 35:30 And Moses said unto the children of Israel, See, the LORD hath%0a%3c called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe%0a%3c of Judah; 35:31 And he hath filled him with the spirit of God, in%0a%3c wisdom, in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of%0a%3c workmanship; 35:32 And to devise curious works, to work in gold, and%0a%3c in silver, and in brass, 35:33 And in the cutting of stones, to set%0a%3c them, and in carving of wood, to make any manner of cunning work.%0a%3c %0a%3c 35:34 And he hath put in his heart that he may teach, both he, and%0a%3c Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan.%0a%3c %0a%3c 35:35 Them hath he filled with wisdom of heart, to work all manner of%0a%3c work, of the engraver, and of the cunning workman, and of the%0a%3c embroiderer, in blue, and in purple, in scarlet, and in fine linen,%0a%3c and of the weaver, even of them that do any work, and of those that%0a%3c devise cunning work.%0a%3c %0a%3c 36:1 Then wrought Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted man, in%0a%3c whom the LORD put wisdom and understanding to know how to work all%0a%3c manner of work for the service of the sanctuary, according to all that%0a%3c the LORD had commanded.%0a%3c %0a%3c 36:2 And Moses called Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted%0a%3c man, in whose heart the LORD had put wisdom, even every one whose%0a%3c heart stirred him up to come unto the work to do it: 36:3 And they%0a%3c received of Moses all the offering, which the children of Israel had%0a%3c brought for the work of the service of the sanctuary, to make it%0a%3c withal. And they brought yet unto him free offerings every morning.%0a%3c %0a%3c 36:4 And all the wise men, that wrought all the work of the sanctuary,%0a%3c came every man from his work which they made; 36:5 And they spake unto%0a%3c Moses, saying, The people bring much more than enough for the service%0a%3c of the work, which the LORD commanded to make.%0a%3c %0a%3c 36:6 And Moses gave commandment, and they caused it to be proclaimed%0a%3c throughout the camp, saying, Let neither man nor woman make any more%0a%3c work for the offering of the sanctuary. So the people were restrained%0a%3c from bringing.%0a%3c %0a%3c 36:7 For the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to make%0a%3c it, and too much.%0a%3c %0a%3c 36:8 And every wise hearted man among them that wrought the work of%0a%3c the tabernacle made ten curtains of fine twined linen, and blue, and%0a%3c purple, and scarlet: with cherubims of cunning work made he them.%0a%3c %0a%3c 36:9 The length of one curtain was twenty and eight cubits, and the%0a%3c breadth of one curtain four cubits: the curtains were all of one size.%0a%3c %0a%3c 36:10 And he coupled the five curtains one unto another: and the other%0a%3c five curtains he coupled one unto another.%0a%3c %0a%3c 36:11 And he made loops of blue on the edge of one curtain from the%0a%3c selvedge in the coupling: likewise he made in the uttermost side of%0a%3c another curtain, in the coupling of the second.%0a%3c %0a%3c 36:12 Fifty loops made he in one curtain, and fifty loops made he in%0a%3c the edge of the curtain which was in the coupling of the second: the%0a%3c loops held one curtain to another.%0a%3c %0a%3c 36:13 And he made fifty taches of gold, and coupled the curtains one%0a%3c unto another with the taches: so it became one tabernacle.%0a%3c %0a%3c 36:14 And he made curtains of goats' hair for the tent over the%0a%3c tabernacle: eleven curtains he made them.%0a%3c %0a%3c 36:15 The length of one curtain was thirty cubits, and four cubits was%0a%3c the breadth of one curtain: the eleven curtains were of one size.%0a%3c %0a%3c 36:16 And he coupled five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by%0a%3c themselves.%0a%3c %0a%3c 36:17 And he made fifty loops upon the uttermost edge of the curtain%0a%3c in the coupling, and fifty loops made he upon the edge of the curtain%0a%3c which coupleth the second.%0a%3c %0a%3c 36:18 And he made fifty taches of brass to couple the tent together,%0a%3c that it might be one.%0a%3c %0a%3c 36:19 And he made a covering for the tent of rams' skins dyed red, and%0a%3c a covering of badgers' skins above that.%0a%3c %0a%3c 36:20 And he made boards for the tabernacle of shittim wood, standing%0a%3c up.%0a%3c %0a%3c 36:21 The length of a board was ten cubits, and the breadth of a board%0a%3c one cubit and a half.%0a%3c %0a%3c 36:22 One board had two tenons, equally distant one from another: thus%0a%3c did he make for all the boards of the tabernacle.%0a%3c %0a%3c 36:23 And he made boards for the tabernacle;

and thou shalt bring in the%0a%3c candlestick, and light the lamps thereof.%0a%3c %0a%3c 40:5 And thou shalt set the altar of gold for the incense before the%0a%3c ark of the testimony, and put the hanging of the door to the%0a%3c tabernacle.%0a%3c %0a%3c 40:6 And thou shalt set the altar of the burnt offering before the%0a%3c door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation.%0a%3c %0a%3c 40:7 And thou shalt set the laver between the tent of the congregation%0a%3c and the altar, and shalt put water therein.%0a%3c %0a%3c 40:8 And thou shalt set up the court round about, and hang up the%0a%3c hanging at the court gate.%0a%3c %0a%3c 40:9 And thou shalt take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle,%0a%3c and all that is therein, and shalt hallow it, and all the vessels%0a%3c thereof: and it shall be holy.%0a%3c %0a%3c 40:10 And thou shalt anoint the altar of the burnt offering, and all%0a%3c his vessels, and sanctify the altar: and it shall be an altar most%0a%3c holy.%0a%3c %0a%3c 40:11 And thou shalt anoint the laver and his foot, and sanctify it.%0a%3c %0a%3c 40:12 And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons unto the door of the%0a%3c tabernacle of the congregation, and wash them with water.%0a%3c %0a%3c 40:13 And thou shalt put upon Aaron the holy garments, and anoint him,%0a%3c and sanctify him;

as the LORD commanded Moses.%0a%3c %0a%3c 40:20 And he took and put the testimony into the ark, and set the%0a%3c staves on the ark, and put the mercy seat above upon the ark: 40:21%0a%3c And he brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the vail of the%0a%3c covering, and covered the ark of the testimony; as the LORD commanded%0a%3c Moses.%0a%3c %0a%3c 40:22 And he put the table in the tent of the congregation, upon the%0a%3c side of the tabernacle northward, without the vail.%0a%3c %0a%3c 40:23 And he set the bread in order upon it before the LORD; as the%0a%3c LORD had commanded Moses.%0a%3c %0a%3c 40:24 And he put the candlestick in the tent of the congregation, over%0a%3c against the table, on the side of the tabernacle southward.%0a%3c %0a%3c 40:25 And he lighted the lamps before the LORD;

as the LORD%0a%3c commanded Moses.%0a%3c %0a%3c 40:33 And he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the%0a%3c altar, and set up the hanging of the court gate. So Moses finished the%0a%3c work.%0a%3c %0a%3c 40:34 Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory%0a%3c of the LORD filled the tabernacle.%0a%3c %0a%3c 40:35 And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the%0a%3c congregation, because the cloud abode thereon, and the glory of the%0a%3c LORD filled the tabernacle.%0a%3c %0a%3c 40:36 And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the%0a%3c children of Israel went onward in all their journeys: 40:37 But if the%0a%3c cloud were not taken up, then they journeyed not till the day that it%0a%3c was taken up.%0a%3c %0a%3c 40:38 For the cloud of the LORD was upon the tabernacle by day, and%0a%3c fire was on it by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel,%0a%3c throughout all their journeys.%0a
