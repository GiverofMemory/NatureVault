It  was  the  more  valued %0aas  it  approached  the  colour  of  gold.  Theophrastus,  c.  89,  tells  us %0athat  ^'arsenicon"  and  "sandarache"  are  painters'  colours. %0a%0aThe  native  genuine  red  orpiment,  or  the  sandaracha,  was  the %0amost  esteemed,  the  Zarnich-Ahmer  of  the  Arabians,  the  paler %0akinds  being  often  impure  were  less  valued.

In  article  261,  tliis  author  tells  us  how  they %0aprepared  orpiment  for  painting :  "  Break  up  orpiment  in  a  skin, %0athen  grind  it  with  water  upon  a  marble,  adding  to  it  a  little  cal- %0acined bone,  and  again  allow  it  to  dry,  temper  it  afterwards  with  egg %0afor  laying  upon  wo|od,  or  on  a  wall.

I  am  in  possession  of  the  several  modes  prac- %0atised for  its  use,  at  a  later  day,  when  orpiment  was  in  constant %0ause  by  the  Italian  painters,  but  these  are  reserved  for  a  future %0aopportunity. %0a%0aWhen  the  yellow  sulphuret  of  arsenic  is  heated,  it  parts  with  a %0aportion  of  the  sulphur,  and  the  substance  becomes  converted  into %0ared  orpiment,  or  "  Realgar." %0a%0aCennino  mentions  the  two  colours ;  *'  Oropimento,"  the  yellow, %0aand  '*  Risigallo,"  the  red  sulphuret,  or  Realgar  ^ %0a%0aC£Ro$A,  c.  1.  The  fabrication  of  that  colour  which  the  Greeks %0acalled  ^I't/Avdi*»,  psimuthion,  and  the  Romans  Cerusa,  or  psimythin, %0ais  described  by  Theophrastus^  Dioscoride8'\  Vitruvius^  and  Pliny  ^ %0ain  nearly  the  same  terras,  and  they  speak  of  it  as  a  colour  com- %0amonly used  in  painting.  Theophrastus  thus  describes  the  process. %0a'*  To  make  which,  lead  is  placed  in  earthen  vessels  over  sharp %0avinegar,  and  after  it  has  acquired  some  thickness  of  a  kind  of  rust, %0awhich  it  commonly  does  in  about  ten  days,  they  open  the  vessels %0aand  scrape  it  off,  as  it  were,  in  a  kind  of  impurity ;  they  then  re- %0aplace (the  lead)  over  the  vinegar,  repeating  often  the  same  method %0aof  scraping,  till  it  is  wholly  dissolved,  they  then  beat  what  has %0abeen  scraped  off  into  powder,  and  boil  for  a  long  time,  and  what %0aat  last  subsides  to  the  bottom  of  the  vessel  is  the  psimuthion." %0a%0aPliny  describes  the  process  nearly  in  the  same  terms. %0a%0aDioscorides  adds  that  the  principal  manufactories  of  ceruse  were %0aat  Rhodes,  at  Corinth,  at  Lacedemon  and  Pozsuoli. %0a%0aVitruvius  informs  us  that  the  Rhodians  put  vine  twigs,  or  ten- %0adrils, in  barrels,  into  which  they  poured  vinegar,  over  this  were %0asuspended  sheets  of  lead  and  the  barrels  were  closed  up.  After %0aa  certain  time  the  lead  was  found  changed  into  ceruse,  and %0aPliny  states  that  the  Rhodian  ceruse  was  the  most  esteemed, — %0a"  Laudatissimum  in  Rhodo."

Marble  is  now  used %0afor  a  like  purpose  in  Holland.  ^ %0a%0aThe  Byzantine  MS.  published  by  MuratoriS  and  which  he %0arefers  to  the  eighth  century,  gives  the  same  receipt  for  making %0a**  white  lead,"  *'  De  composition  psimitthin." %0a%0aThus,  no  alteration  in  the  manufacture  of  white  lead  had  been %0aattempted  from  the  time  of  Aristotle  to  that  of  our  author.  L.  1. %0ac.  39.  In  the  MS.  British  Museum,  Sloane  1754,  ceruse  is  called %0a*%3c  Minium  Album."  This  MS.  is  of  the  early  half  of  the  four- %0ateenth century^. %0a%0aThe  use  of  ceruse  as  a  pigment  is  confined  by  Theophilus  to %0aplaster  work,  wood,  or  canvass.  Sir  H.  Davy  in  his  analysis  of  the %0acolours  of  the  ancients  ^  found  that  the  whites  he  examined  *'  were %0aall  fine  chalk,"  yer,  that  Davy  did  not  find  white  lead  used  upon  a %0amural  decoration  is  no  proof  that  it  did  not  enter  into  the  other %0adecorations,  or  pictures,  of  the  Romans,  used  in  encaustic,  or  with %0agums,  gluten,  or  oil  upon  plaster  work. %0a%0aThe  white  lead  of  the  present  period  is  a  combination  of  prot- %0aoxide of  lead  with  carbonic  acid,  and  is  a  sub-carbonate  of  lead. %0aIt  is  prepared,  at  Clichy,  by  forming  a  precipitate,  with  carbonic %0aacid  gas,  in  a  saturated  solution  of  prot-oxide  of  lead  in  distilled %0avinegar.  The  current  of  carbonic  acid  gas  is  passed  through  this %0asolution,  and  the  precipitate  is  washed  and  dried. %0a%0aA  patent  was  recently  taken  in  London  for  a  means  of  manu- %0afacturing white  lead  by  one  process  from  the  metal.  Very  small %0ashot  was  violently  agitated  in  water,  by  which  a  pulverulent %0ahydaated  oxide  was  produced.  This,  having  been  exposed  to  the %0aair,  became  converted  into  a  carbonate. %0a%0aHad  this  powder  been  exposed  to  the  action  o£  carbonic  acid  gas %0ain  a  close  chamber,  a  fine  carbonate  of  lead  would  have  been  pro- %0aduced fit  for  the  artist;  as  it  was^  the  patent  was  not  much  valued,  as %0atwo  processes  would  have  been  necessary  during  the  manufacture. %0a%0aCenobrium,  c.

Hill  in  his  notes  to  Theophrastus^  thinks %0athat  this  latter  substance  was  the  **  Sil  Atticum  "  of  the  Romans, %0ainjudiciously  confounded,  he  states,  by  Vitruvius  with  the  Ochra %0aAttica  of  the  ancients.  Hill,  however,  produces  no  reason  or %0asupport  for  this  assertion.  The  **  Sil  Atticum,"  was  of  a  golden %0acolour,  which  was  altered  in  its  hue  by  burning.  The  origin  of  the %0aterm  is  probably  a-iXat,  fulgor,  auro  similis. %0a%0aThere  were  the  **  Sil  Atticum,"  Marmorosum^  and  Pressum,  vel %0aSyricum. %0a%0aThe  factitious  cinnabar  was  more  likely  a  true  minium,  die  in- %0avention or  introduction  of  Callias  the  Athenian.     (See  Minium.) %0a%0aThe  **  Native  Cinnabar,"  however,  of  Theophrastus  was  identical %0awith  ours,  it  was  vermilion,  or  sulphuret  of  quicksilver,  and  that %0awriter  relates  the  process  of  extracting  the  metal  from  the  ore  by %0a*'  rubbing  it  with  vinegar  with  a  brass  pestle  in  a  brass  mortar."^ %0aDuring  this  process  the  brass  would  be  attacked  by  the  acid,  and, %0athrough  the  affinity  of  the  copper  for  the  sulphur,  the  cinnabar %0awould  be  reduced  to  the  metallic  state. %0a%0aDioscorides  tells  that  '*  a  cinnabar  is  worked  in  Spain  ^,  and  that %0aduring  the  operation  the  workmen  cover  the  face  with  a  skin %0abecause  of  the  (mercurial)  vapours  dangerous  to  inhale;"  he  like- %0awise describes  the  process  of  extracting  quicksilver  from  cinnabar. %0a%0aPliny,  likewise,  describes  a  **  Cinnabar  or  Minium  "  **  whose  pro- %0aduce we  have  called  quicksilver,"  "  cujus  vomicam  argentum  vivum %0aappellavimus."^ %0a%0aCinnabar  was  the  *%3c  Minium"  of  Vitruvius^  who  gives  a  process %0afor  using  it  in  staining  walls  of  a  red  colour'. %0a%0aCinnabar  has  been  confounded  with  the  "  Miltos"  of  Uie  Greeks, %0awhich  is  a  red  ochreous  earth  and  the  most  ancient  red  colour %0aknown.

Put  it  into  the  above  bottle, %0awhich  you  afterwards  place  on  four  stones,  and,  laying  a  very %0aslight  fire  of  coals  round  the  bottle,  cover  its  mouth  with  a  tile, %0aand  when  you  see  the  smoke  come  white  from  the  mouth  of  the %0abottle,  close  it,  but  when  a  smoke  as  red  as  the  vermilion  shall %0acome  out,  take  it  from  the  fire  and  you  will  have  the  best  ver- %0amilion."

The  ancient  lake  did  not  change  its  colour. %0aThe  ancient  lake  agreed  with  the  lake  of  co(;hineal  in  being  ren- %0adered of  a  deeper  hue  by  weak  alkalies,  and  of  a  brighter  hue  by %0aweak  acids,  but  it  differed  from  it  in  being  much  more  easily  de- %0astroyed by  strong  acids.  It  agreed  with  both  in  being  immediately %0adestroyed  by  a  solution  of  chlorine." %0a%0aWas  this  colour  *'orceine?"

With  this,  oil  of  linseed  or  hempseed, %0aor  walnuts  is  to  be  used,  two  parts  to  one  of  resin.  He  concludes, %0a**  Et  Tetendez  desus  la  peinture  a  vos  doigts^  car  si  vous  le  fassiez %0adu  pincel,  il  seroit  trop  epais  et  ne  pourroit  secher." %0a%0aHaving  established  that  the  vernix  is  sandarac,  the  '*  vernice %0aliquida"  of  Cennino,  and  of  the  early  Italians,  is  known  to  us. %0aMrs.  Merrifield  in  her  translation  of  this  author^  refers  in  a  note %0ato  this  face.  Cennino,  therefore,  gives  the  receipt  for  making  the %0a'*  vernice  liquida*'  in  the  151  cap.  He  singularly  also  shows  that %0athe  Italians  were  aware  of  the  action  of  metallic  oxides  as  driers. %0aThe  directions  are  for  making  a  mordant,  perfect  for  walls,  pictures, %0aupon  glass,  or  iron^  or  anywhere. %0a%0a"  Take  your  oil,  cooked  at  the  fir6,  or  in  the  sun,  by  the  mode %0awhich  I  have  before  shown  you.  ,  Grind  with  this  oil  a  little  white %0aand  verdigris;  and  when  you  have  ground  them  as  with  water,  put %0aa  little  vernice  into  it  and  allow  all  to  boil  together  a  little." %0a%0aIt  appears  to  me  that  this  passage  has  never  been  rightly  read, %0athe  word  "vernice,"  by  which  Cennino  intended  sandarac,  having %0abeen  accepted  as  %3c*  varnish"  or  the  "  vernice  liquida"  itself.

It  is  my  endeavour %0ahere  to  ascertain  and  expose  the  materials  universally  employed %0ain  the  studio  previously  to  the  time  of  Van  Eyck.  What  that %0apainter  probably  did  invent,  I  have  endeavoured  to  show  in  the %0aPreface  to  this  work. %0a%0aCennino  speaks  of  '*  vernice  liquida"  in  several  places,  yet  he %0agives  no  mode  of  making  it  unaccompanied  by  driers. %0a%0a'  Cennino  Cennini,  transUited  by  Mn.

By %0athe  first  process  the  resinous  portion  alone  of  this  gum  resin  would %0abe  dissolved,  unless  the  boiling  were  continued  for  a  very  long %0atime,  so  as  at  last  to  raise  the  heat  to  a  high  degree,  in  order  to %0akeep  the  oil  at  the  simmering  point,  which  becomes  higher  in  pro- %0aportion to  the  loss  of  the  more  volatile  portions  of  the  oil,  which %0ait  will  be  remembered  are  allowed  to  escape,  **  until  a  third  part %0ais  consumed.**  The  varnish,  however,  is  not  perfected  by  the  first %0aprocess,  and  is  of  a  very  dark  colour.  By  the  second  process  the %0awhole  of  the  resin  may  be  incorporated  with  the  oil  at  once  and  the %0along  boiling  is  not  required,  nor  does  Theophiius  prescribe  it. %0aThe  word  '*  bullire,"  is  used  by  our  author  in  opposition  to %0a"  coquere,"  the  latter  having  the  signification  of  %3c'  to  seeth," %0athe  former  "  to  boil  violently,"  as  "  cestuo  "  "  ferveo,"  against  the %0adanger  of  which  he  cautions  the  artist. %0a%0aThe  true  Arabian  sandarac  is  stated  by  Schousboe  S  a  Danish %0atraveller,  to  be  produced  by  the  thuia  articulata,  which  is  a  cy- %0apress.

Place  this  powder %0ain  a  pot,  with  a  little  naphtha,  and  a  little  peseri,  to  prevent  burn- %0aing or  blackening  in  the  melting.

The  use  of  ink  is  ancient ;  Moses  itientions  it %0ain  Numbers,  v.  2S,  also  Jeremiah,  xxxvi.  18 ;  the  principal  colour* %0aing  matter  was  smoke  black  combined  with  tannic  acid.  These %0ainks  approach  the  composition  of  the  Chinese  or  Indian  ink  a» %0amade  at  present;  the  Chinese  have  l^td  the  credit  of  the  invention %0aof  ink,  but  it  is  more  probably  of  Egyptian  origin. %0a%0aColoured  inks  were  used  by  the  Orientals ;  the  emperors  of  the  East %0ahad  their  **  sacrum  encaustum,"  which  was  made  with  purple^  and %0awhich  was  kept  in  vases  of  gold  enriched  with  gems,  the  guardian- %0aship of  which  was  entrusted  to  the  royal  officers  ^  and  the  use  of %0awhich  was  interdicted  as  a  capital  offence. %0a%0aThe  word  "  encaustum "  is  evidently  in  this  case  much  per- %0averted from  its  original  signification,  it  having  been  first  used  to %0adenote  the  process  of  the  ancient  Greek  painters,  who  applied  heat %0ato  their  colours,  which  were  laid  upon  an  absorbent  surface  with %0awax,  in  order  to  drive  them  into  the  grounds  upon  which  they %0a%0a*  The  ocque  is  a  weight  used  in  the  Levant,  equal  to  about  three  pounds  and  a %0ahalf,  English  weight. %0a%0a■  Nouveau  traits  de  Diplomatique,  T.  1,  p.  654.

Originally  representing  a  dark  colour  or %0afluid,  it  gradually  was  used  to  denote  diflerent  coloured  fluids  or %0a"  inks"  used  for  various  purposes'. %0a%0aThe  fabrication  of  ink  by  means  of  "  Roman  vitriol "  (sulphate %0aof  iron)  and  oak  bark,  (tannic  acid,)  is  of  more  recent  origin, %0aprobably  a  century  or  two  before  the  Christian  era. %0a%0aSir  H.

And  it  is  very  probable  that  the  adoption  of  this  ink  and %0athe  use  of  parchment  took  place  at  the  same  time ;  for  the  ink %0acomposed  of  charcoal  and  a  solution  of  glue  can  scarcely  be  made %0ato  adhere  to  the  skin,  whereas  the  free  acid  of  the  chemical  ink %0apartly  dissolves  the  gelatine  of  the  MS.,  and  the  whole  substance %0aadheres  as  a  mordant."  ^ %0a%0aThis  is  not  certain ;  Pliny  gives  a  mode  for  detecting  sulphate %0aof  iron  in  sulphate  of  copper  by  the  infusion  of  galls  upon  paper ; %0ahe  says  "  it  instantly  blackens."  * %0a%0aDavy  appears  to  have  overlooked  the  following  passage  in  Pliny, %0awhich  shows  that  acid  inks  were  known  before  his  time.

This  comparison.  Hill  remarks,  **is  a %0aconfirmation  that  the  sapphire  and  cyanus  are  not  the  same  stone, %0aas  they  arecompaied  together; "  it  may  be  added  that  it  identifies %0athe  sapphire  with  the  lapis  lazuli,  the  cyanus  being  of  two %0akinds,  divided  into  male  and  female,  the  male  being  of  a  deeper %0acolour^  Yet  Hill  here  unfortunately  falls  into  error,  as  he  re- %0amarks that  "  this  cyanus  is  a  gem,  and  is  the  lapis  lazuli  of %0awhich  ultramarine  is  made,"  whereas  that  colour  is  only  truly %0amade  from  the  sapphire  of  the  Greeks,  the  true  **  lapis  lazuli." %0aTheophrastus  does  not  speak  of  cyanus  **  as  a  gem "  at  all ; %0anoticing   that   in    the    **  carnelian  "  and  the   "  lapis   lyncurius" %0a%0a>  Theophr.  de  Lapidibus.

Leonardus,  &c.,  &c.,  &c. %0a%0aTheophrastus  tells  us  that  the  sapphire  was  spotted,  as  it  were, %0awith  gold,  **  xf *^^^^C^f •"  Hil^  denies  this  to  be  the  lapis  lazuli, %0afollowing  De  Boot,  who  writes,  ''  Quam  gemman  Plinius  sapphi- %0arum  vocat,  cyanus  est,  seu  lapis  lazuli,"  a  double  error,  divided %0abetween  both  the  critics. %0a%0aBut  Theophrastus  says  that^  "  The  native  cyanus,'*  (or  lapis %0aarmenus)  "  ictaw;  «uto^i/jjc"  has  in  it  "  chrysocoUa,"  "  ;^utf^xoXAa»," %0awhich,  with  the  ancients,  was  a  green  oxide  of  copper.  Hill  here %0aadmits  this  to  mean  the  lapis  armenus,  attempting  to  avoid  the %0adilemma  by  making  the  cyanus  before  mentioned  a  '*  gem,"  for- %0agetting that  there  were  more  than  one  kind  of  **  cyanus." %0a%0aIn  c.  90,  Theophrastus  places  nvatoi,  cyanus,  and  "  chryso- %0acoUa"  among  colours  used  by  painters. %0a%0aHill,  having  apparently  perplexed  himself,  accuses  Pliny  of  con- %0afusion ^  and,  having  embroiled  the  question,  asserts  that  Pliny  has %0amisunderstood  Theophrastus.  This  is  both  unlikely  and  erroneous. %0aPliny  "  De  Jaspidum  generibus"  1.  37.  c.  9,  describes  cyanus, %0aand  after  mentioning,  as  Theophrastus,  that  the  Egyptian  kind  was %0a''  tinctured,"  proceeds,  *' Dividitur  autem  et  hoc  in  mares  foemi- %0anasque.

'%3c  Ceruleae  et  sapphiri,  raroque  cum  purpura.

Any  colour,  however,  procured  from  silver,  on %0aaccount  of  its  liability  to  suffer  from  hydro-sulphurous  vapours, %0awould  be  very  little  permanent.

L.  3,  Theophilus  directs  that  the  names  of  the  Apostles %0abe  inscribed  on  the  limbos  or  borders  surmounting  the  figures %0a— "  Quorum  nomina  scribes  in  limbo."  The  Greek  artists  wrote %0athe  name  of  the  personage  represented  either  on  the  nimbus  or %0aglory,  or  on  the  limbus  surrounding  it,  as  the  Greeks  were  for- %0abidden to  reverence  unknown  images. %0a%0aManisc,  c.  14.  In  the  table  of  synonimes  ^^  Menesch,"  is  stated %0ato  be  a  red  colour  darker  than  minium  and  lighter  than  sinoper ; %0athe  hue  of  indigo  is  likewise  attributed  to  it.

That  a  violet  colour  would %0acoincide  with  the  directions  for  the  use  of  manisc  by  Theophilus %0ais  evident,  for  it  is  used  mixed  either  with  folium,  or  a  little  black %0aand  red,  as  a  ground  for  a  drapery,  manisc  and  lazur,  and,  lastly, %0apure  lazur  being  used  to  lighten  it.

It  is  remarkable  that  although  Theophrastus  has %0aaccurately  described  the  miltos  and  cinnabar  of  the  Greeks,  he %0ahas  made  no  mention  of  minium  or  the  "  red  oxide  of  lead." %0a%0aA  great  confusion  of  terms  has  unfortunately  occurred  amongst %0athe  ancient  writers  with  respect  to  minium,  and  numerous  errors %0ahave  arisen  from  the  reproduction  of  these  inaccuracies.  The %0aminium  of  the  Romans  was  sometimes  our  "  vermilion,"  or %0a*'  sulphuret  of  mercury,"  sometimes  our  **  minium,"  or  "  prot- %0aoxide of  lead,"  sometimes  the  "  red  ochres,"  as  the  "  minium %0asinopium"  of  Pliny. %0a%0aDioscorides '  signalises  this  error.  *%3c  Some  erroneously  believe %0athat  minium  is  identical  with  cinnabar,"  &c«  The  minium  of %0aDioscorides  was  produced  from  a  galena.  **  For  ^  minium  is  made %0afirom  an  argentiferous  stone  mixed  with  sand."  Was  this  the %0a"artificial  cinnabar"  of  Theophrastus  invented  by  Callias  the %0aAthenian  in  the  reign  of  Praxibulus,  only  ninety  years  before  his %0atime  "  ?     This  would  account  for  the  confusion  of  terms. %0a%0aThe  *^  minium  "  manufactured  from  cerussa  is  called  '%3c  sandyx  " %0aby  Dioscorides,  L.  5,  c.  57.  This  term  for  minium  was  adopted %0aafterwards  in  Italy,  as  Hieron.  Cardanus  says  that  minium  was %0aalso  called  "  sandyx,"  and  that  **  sandlx  "  was  a  term  also  applied  to %0aburnt  ochre  ;  and  in  the  much  quoted  line  of  Virgil, %0a%0a*'  Sponte  su&  sandyx  pascentes  vestiet  agnos," %0a%0aThis  latter    colour  would   seem   to    be   intended,  rather    than %0a%0a>  DioiGor.

An- %0athrax was  a  term  applied  by  the  Greeks  to  gems  or  rare  stones %0aof  a  red  colour;  Vitruvius  evidently  applies  it  to  the  native  cinna- %0abar, as  %3c*  it  yields  drops  of  quicksilver."  He  calls  the  minium  of %0athe  moderns,  or  red  prot-oxide  of  lead,  '*  sandaracha/'  ^  **  Cerussa %0avero  cum  in  fornace  coquitur,  mutato  colore  ad  ignis  incendium %0aefficitur  sandaracha." %0a%0aBut  Pliny,  better  informed  upon  these  points,  tells  us  that  a %0aminium  is  made  from  a  veined  stone^  from  which  also  silver  is %0aextracted,  not  from  that  whose  liquid  we  call  quicksilver;  "  galena %0ais  evidently  intended,  as  it  is  by  Dioscorides  '\  Yet  he  tells  us %0athat  minium  is  called  cinnabar  by  the  Greeks,  *'  and  that  a  minium %0acalled  also  cinnabaris  is  produced  in  the  mines  of  Spain,"  as  at %0athis  day. %0a%0aAn  inferior  minium,  the  ''  minium  secundarium  "  of  Pliny,  was %0amade  by  grinding  the  burnt  and  exhausted  lead  ore,  of  a  red %0acolour. %0a%0aIn  a  chamber  in  the  Baths  of  Titus  a  bright  red  was  found  in %0aan  earthen  vase.  This  was  analysed  by  Davy,  who  found  that  it %0afused  into  litharge,  consequently  that  it  was  the  true  "minium" %0aor  red  prot-oxide  of  lead  *. %0a%0aWhen  massicot  is  calcined  in  a  reverberatory  furnace,  it  gradually %0aassumes  a  dark  purple  colour ;  when  this  has  taken  place,  the %0adoors  should  be  closed,  allowing  the  air  to  enter  very  slowly.  The %0alonger  the  process  of  cooling  the  finer  is  the  minium,  and  the %0acolour  is  heightened  if  it  is  kept  constantly  stirred,  as  more  oxygen %0ais  imbibed.  The  quantity  of  oxygen  taken  up  by  the  lead  is  enor- %0amous. I  have  been  assured  by  a  practical  chemist,  that  twelve %0aparts  of  lead,  by  weight,  produce  thirteen  of  minium,  if  the  pro- %0acess has  been  properly  conducted. %0a%0aI  give  an  extract  verbatim  from  the  MSS.  of  Peter  of  St.  Aude- %0a%0a«  Vit.  ae  Aichit.

In  the  former  style  par- %0aticular colours  are  to  be  used,  mixed  with  lime  to  make  them %0abind,  "propter  firmitatem,"  chap.  16.  The  dry  wall,  "murus %0asiccus,"  is  saturated  with  water,  and  the  colours  applied  while  it %0ais  wet.  The  whole  dries  together,  c.  15.  This  was  the  Byzantine %0amode  of  painting  upon  walls>  "  in  humido,"  and  is  quite  a  dif- %0aferent process  from  that  known  by  the  name  of  **  fresco,"  which %0awas  of  Italian  invention.

Theophilus  speaks  of  lime^  only  in  connection  with %0amural  decoration. %0a%0aKequeno '  thought  with  reason  that  the  ancients  were  ignorant %0aof  the  style  of  *'buon  fresco/'  and  that  the  directions  of  Vitruvius' %0a"  De  tectoriis  operibus**  were  for  colouring  the  surface  of  the %0aplaster  before  it  hardened.  He  adds  that  Winkelmann  and  the %0aacademicians  observed  that  at  Herculaneum,  when  some  of  the %0apaintings  were  washed,  the  colours  of  the  figures,  &c.,  were  re- %0amoved and  the  even  smooth  coloured  ground  only  remained.  Other %0afigures  were  painted  with  "  Punic  wax  and  oil."  Vitruvius  cer- %0atainly nowhere  speaks  of  painting  upon  cement,  although  he  gives %0adirections  for  colouring  it. %0a%0aThe  passage  of  Pliny  ^  "  Ex  omnibus  coloribus  cretulam  amant %0audoque  illini  recusant,  purpurissimum,  Indicum,  caeruleum,  meli- %0anum,  auripigmentum,  appianum,  cerussa,"  applies  to  the  process %0adescribed  by  Vitruvius. %0a%0aThe  phrase,  however,  of  Theophilus  "  in  recenti  muro"  "  upon  a %0anew  wall**  cannot  be  overlooked.  It  is  not  the  '*  murus  siccus'*  of %0achap.  15,  but  it  appears  to  mean  that  *' fresco*'  was  intended %0aby  Theophilus.  How  then  to  coincide  the  neglect  of  our  author %0ain  this  instance  with  his  universal  care  in  description,  if  ''  fresco" %0awere  intended?  Theophilus,  who  promises  to  teach  us  all  the  Greeks %0aknew  in  the  art  of  painting,  would  not,  certainly,  have  neglected %0aso  important  a  branch.  The  Byzantine  MS.  published  by  Muratori %0ais  silent  upon  the  subject^  Eraclius  likewise,  as  also  the  writers %0acollected  by  Le  Begue ;  and  it  was  not  until  the  translation  of  the %0aByzantine  MS.  from  Mount  Athos^  published  by  Mons.

For  this,  you  begin  by  placing  a %0aladder.  Then  take  water  in  a  large  vase,  and  throw  some  with  a %0aspoon  against  the  wall  so  as  to  wet  it.  If  the  wall  is  built  of %0aearth,  scratch  the  earth  with  a  trowel  as  much  as  you  can,  because, %0aabove  all  at  the  vault,  the  lime  will  detach  itself  more  tardily. %0aWet  it  again  and  polish  the  surface.  If  the  wall  is  in  brick,  you %0awill  wet  it  five  or  six  times,  and  you  will  make  the  plaster  work  of %0alime,  of  the  thickness  of  two  fingers  and  more,  to  retain  humidity^ %0aand  to  allow  you  to  take  advantage  of  it.  If  the  wall  is  in  stone, %0awet  it  only  once  or  twice^  and  put  a  much  smaller  quantity  of %0aplaster,  for  stone  takes  humidity  easily  and  does  not  dry.  During %0awinter,  lay  one  coat  of  plaster  in  the  evening,  and  another,  more %0asuperficial,  the  next  morning.  In  the  fine  season,  do  what  is  the %0aroost  convenient,  and,  after  having  laid  on  the  last  couch  of  plaster, %0aequalize  it  well;  allow  it  to  take  consistence,  and  work." %0a%0a"  HOW   TO   DRAW    WHEN    FAINTING   UPON    WALLS. %0a%0a**  When  you  would  draw  upon  a  wall,  smooth  its  surface  well. %0aThen  take  a  compass,  and  attach  to  both  its  branches  pieces  of %0awood,  so  as  to  lengthen  it  as  much  as  you  wish.  Attach  a  small %0abrush  (pinceau)  to  the  extremity  of  one  of  these  sticks.  You %0awill  draw  out  the  nimbus  of  your  personages,  and  you  will  indicate %0aall  the  measures  which  are  necessary.  Then  make  a  very  slight %0asketch  with  ochre;  finish  your  outlines.  If  you  wish  to  correct %0a(effacer)  anything,  employ  oxy  (red  ochre  or  sinoper) .  Retouch %0athe  nimbus,  repolish  the  surface  well,  and  employ  black;  polish %0athe  drapery,  and  lay  on  the  proplasm.  Try  to  terminate  very %0aquickly  that  which  you  have  polished ;  for,  if  you  are  too  tardy, %0aa  brust  will  form  upon  the  surface  which  would  not  absorb  the %0acolour.  Work  the  face  in  the  same  manner ;  you  will  design  the %0aoutline  with  a  piece  of  bone  cut  to  a  point,  and  put  on  the  flesh %0acolour  as  promptly  as  possible,  before  the  formation  of  a  crust,  as %0awe  have  before  said." %0a%0a**  BOW    WHITE    IS   PREPARED   FOR   PAINTINO   ON   WALLS. %0a%0a"Take  very  old  lime  (chalk).

Grind  them  well,  and  sketch  the %0aeyes,  nose,  hands,  and  feet.  For  the  pupil  of  the  eyes,  very  fine %0ablack  must  be  employed,  like  that  which  is  collected  from  the %0asmoke  of  an  oily  wood,  for  if  you  employ  the  black  which  is  in  use %0afor  the  grounds  and  draperies,  it  will  soon  be  effaced." %0a%0a*'  HOW    TO   MAKE    FLESH    COLOUR   AND   OLYCASM    FOR   FAINTING   ON %0a%0aWALLS. %0a%0a"  Take  white  ....  dr*. ;  ochre  of  Thasos  ....  dra".  (a  yellow %0aochre);  bole  ....  dra".  (a  bright  red  earth,  the  true  Armenian  earth.) %0aGrind  them  with  care  upon  a  marble,  and  you  will  obtain  a  beauti- %0aful colour  for  flesh.  By  adding  proplasm  to  this  colour,  you  will %0aobtain  a  glycasm,  such  as  is  used  in  choice  pictures.  If  you  wish %0ato  paint  more  quickly,  you  commence  by  making  the  flesh  with %0athis  colour  (flesh  colour),  and  you  will  terminate  the  outlines  by %0amelting  them  with  glycasm." %0a%0a"  HOW    THE    REDS    ARE    EMPLOYED. %0a%0a"  Make  the  mouths  of  young  people  with  pure  bole.  You  mix %0athe  red  with  the  bole  and  the  flesh  colour  for  the  margin  of  the %0alips,  and  you  will  use  it  for  the  shadows  of  hands  or  other  mem- %0abers. In  the  shadows  of  aged  persons,  you  can  employ  very  fine %0abole;  as  for  hair  and  beards,  you  act  upon  a  wall  as  for  pictures." %0a%0a%0a{( %0a%0a%0aHOW    REFLECTIONS    ARE   GIVEN    UPON    A    WALL   WITH    AZURE. %0a%0a%0a'*  Add  indigo  upon  your  pallet  to  the  azure,  to  hinder  it  from %0aspoiling  upon  the  wall.

The  pro- %0acesses of  this  day  are  the  same,  nearly,  as  those  of  former  times. %0a%0a**  Here,  then,  is  the  manner  in  which  I  saw  a  fresco  painted  in  the %0aMonastery  of  Esphigmenou,  by  Father  Joasaph,  by  his  brother, %0aby  his  first  pupil,  who  was  a  'diacre'  and  the  future  heir  of  the %0astudio,  and  by  two  children  of  twelve  or  fifteen  years  of  age. %0a%0a*'  The  porch  of  the  church,  or  narthex,  which  they  were  painting %0a%0a%0a90  M0TE8   TO   BOOK   I. %0a%0aat  the  time  of  our  passage,  had  just  been  built;  it  was  scaffolded %0afor  receiving  the  fresco  paintings  at  the  upper  part  of  the  vault. %0aWorkmen,  under  the  direction  of  the  painters,  prepared  in  the %0acourt  the  mixed  lime  which  was  to  serve  as  the  plaster.  As  two %0aplasterings  are  made,  there  are  two  kinds  of  lime ;  the  firsts  a  kind %0aof  mortar  rather  fine,  is  mixed  with  straw  cut  small^  which  gives  it %0aa  yellow  colour ;  in  the  second^  which  is  of  a  finer  quality,  they %0amix  cotton  or  flax.  It  is  with  the  lime  of  a  yellow  colour  that %0athey  make  the  first  plastering ;  it  adheres  to  the  wall  better  than  the %0asecond.  The  second  is  white,  fine,  and  makes  a  rather  firm  paste, %0aby  means  of  the  cotton ;  it  is  this  which  receives  the  painting. %0a%0a**  The  workmen  then  bring  the  yellow  lime  and  apply  upon  the %0awall  a  layer  of  the  thickness  of  about  half  a  centimetre  \  Upon %0athis  layer,  some  hours  afterwards  they  spread  a  pellicle  of  the  fine %0aand  white  lime.  This  second  operation  demands  more  care  than %0athe  first,  and  I  have  seen  the  brother  of  the  painter  Joasaph,  a %0apainter  himself,  ^PP^y  t^i>  second  couch  of  lime.     Thby  wait %0a%0aTURBE  DAYS   FOR   THE   HUMIDITY   TO   EVAPORATE.      If  tfacy  painted %0a%0abefore  that  time,  the  lime  would  soil  the  colours ;  afterwards,  the %0apainting  would  not  be  solid,  and  would  not  enter  into  the  mortar, %0awhich  would  be  too  hard,  too  dry  to  absorb  the  colours.  It  need %0anot  be  said  that  the  thermometrical  state  of  the  atmosphere %0aabridges  or  lengthens  the  interval  which  must  be  allowed  to  leave %0athe  plaster  to  dry  suitably  before  painting. %0a%0a**  Before  drawing,  the  master  painter  smooths  the  lime  with  a %0aspatula ;  then,  by  means  of  a  string,  he  determines  the  size  which %0ahis  picture  should  have.  Within  this  picture,  on  the  ground  of  his %0afigures,  he  measures  with  a  compass  the  dimensions  which  the  dif- %0aferent objects,  which  he  wishes  to  represent,  will  have.  The  com- %0apass which  Father  Joasaph  used  was  simply  a  cane  bent  double, %0adivided  in  the  middle,  and  adjusted  by  a  piece  of  wood,  which %0aunited  the  two  branches  and  brought  them  together  or  parted  them %0aat  pleasure.  One  of  the  branches  was  sharpened  to  a  point,  the %0aother  was  furnished  with  a  small  brush,  (pinceau.)  A  compass  of %0aa  more  simple,  commodious,  or  economical  fashion  could  not  be %0amade. %0a%0a'*  The  brush,  which  garnishes  the  extremity  of  one  branch  of  the %0acompass,  is  dipped  into  red ;  it  is  with  this  colour  that  the  draw- %0a%0a*  A  centrimetic  ia,  in  ancient  meaf  uie,  4  lines  and  .4344^  or  about  half  an  Bnglith %0ainch. %0a%0a%0aNOTES   TO   BOOK    I.  91 %0a%0aing  is  slightly  traeed  and  the  picture  sketched.  The  compass %0aserves  principally  for  the  nimbus,  the  heads,  and  the  circular  parts ; %0athe  rest  is  traced  with  the  hand,  which  is  only  armed  with  a  small %0abrush  (pinceau.)  In  less  than  an  hour,  Father  Joasaph  had  traced %0abefore  us  an  entire  picture,  in  which  figured  Christ  and  his  Apos- %0atles, of  the  natural  size;  he  made  this  sketch  entirely  from  idea, %0awithout  any  hesitation,  carton  or  model,  and  without  even  looking %0aat  the  figures  already  painted  by  him  in  other  neighbouring  pic* %0atures.  I  did  not  see  him  efface  or  rectify  a  single  line,  so  sure  was %0ahe  of  his  hand.  He  commenced  by  sketching  the  principal  per- %0asonage, Christ,  who  was  in  the  midst  of  his  Apostles.  He  made %0afirst  the  head,  then  the  remainder  of  the  figure  in  descending. %0aThen  he  drew  the  first  Apostle  on  the  right,  then  the  first  on  the %0alefl,  then  the  second  on  the  right  and  led,  and  so  the  others,  sym- %0ametrically. The  painter  traced  his  sketches,  his  hand  raised  and %0awithout  using  a  rest;  this  instrument,  used  by  our  painters,  would %0aenter  the  still  humid  plaster.  However^  the  hand  is  rested  upon %0athe  wall  itself  when  it  trembles,  or  is  fatigued. %0a%0a'*  Inside  this  red  line,  which  defines  the  outline  of  the  figures,  an %0ainferior  painter  spread^  a  black  ground  S  which  he  relieves  with %0ablue,  but  in  a  tint  as  flat  as  the  black  ground  itself.  It  is  upon %0athis  field  that  this  painter,  a  «kind  of  practitioner,  designs  the %0adraperies  and  other  ornaments.  As  to  the  nude,  he  does  not %0atouch  it;  that  is  reserved  for  the  master.  All  the  draperies  are %0amade,  and  the  circular  line  of  the  nimbus  is  traced^  before  the %0ahead,  the  feet^  and  the  hands. %0a%0a"  The  master  then  takes  this  sketched  figure,  and  forms  the  head. %0aHe  spreads  at  two  different  times  a  couch  of  blackish  colour, %0a(noir&tre,)  over  all  the  face^  and  fixes  the  outline  of  the  face  with %0aa  colour  still  deeper.  He  paints  two  faces  at  once^  going  in- %0acessantly from  one  to  the  other,  to  exhaust  all  the  colour  con- %0atained in  the  pencil;  the  colour  of  one  head  must  likewise  have %0atime  to  be  imbibed  into  the  wall  while  the  second  is  preparing. %0aThen  with  a  yellow  colour  he  makes  the  forehead,  cheeks,  neck^ %0aand  the  flesh  parts.     A  first  couch  of  yellow  extinguishes  the %0a%0a1  This  "black  ground"  most  be  the  proplasm,  which,  while  wet,  would  appear %0aquite  black.  The  mixture  of  blue  would  prepare  for  the  half  tints,  as  in  this  pro- %0acess the  tights  are  graduated  into  the  shadows,  passing  over  the  prepared  half  tint %0aAn  improvement  upon  the  practice  of  Theophilus,  and  of  later  date. %0a%0a%0a92  NOTES   TO    BOOK    I. %0a%0ablack  colour;  a  second  lightens  the  face^  Here  the  tint  pre- %0adominates, and  the  tone  should  be  true.  The  painter  tries  the %0adegree  of  colour  upon  the  nimbus,  which  is  traced,  but  not  yet %0apainted,  and  which  serves  him  as  a  palette  under  these  circum- %0astances. %0a%0a"^  Afler  these  two  couches  of  yellow,  one  which  kills  the  black, %0athe  other  which  lightens  the  flesh,  you  perceive  the  flesh  appear. %0aA  third  couch  of  this  clear  yellow,  thicker  than  tlie  two  first,  gives %0athe  general  tone  of  the  carnations.  The  painter  has  not  made  the %0aface  "  bit  by  bit,*'  but  all  at  once ;  he  spreads  a  couch  over  all  the %0aface  before  passing  to  another  colour.  The  eyes  alone  are  ex- %0acepted ;  they  are  reserved  for  tlie  end.  Then^  with  a  pale  green, %0ahe  softens  the  black,  which  he  has  \eh  in  the  shaded  parts,  and %0awhich  he  had  already  enlivened  with  blue.  Then^  with  yellow^  he %0anarrows  the  trespassing  (empietements)  of  the  green. %0a%0a**  This  green,  which  tempers  the  black,  gives  the  shadows.  The %0aflesh  thus  apparent  is  made  to  live  :  he  passes  a  rose  colour  over %0athe  cheeks,  the  lips,  the  eyelids,  to  lighten  them  and  show  the  cir- %0aculation of  the  blood  there.  Then  the  eyebrows  appear  under  a %0adeep  brown,  also  the  hair  and  beard,  and  then  the  outline  of  the %0aface  is  determined. %0a%0a"  The  eyes  have  remained  black,  under  the  two  first  and  general %0alayers.  With  a  deeper  black  he  forms  the  pupil,  and  the  sclerotick %0awith  white;  then  a  pale  and  fine  rose  colour  gives  the  little  lumi- %0anous point  of  the  eye;  the  eye  is  lit,  and  the  figure  sees. %0a%0a'*  The  lips  were  only  indicated,  the  drawing  of  the  mouth  was  too %0ablack ;  the  painter  lightens  and  terminates  the  mouth  and  the  lips. %0a%0a"  He  then  surrounds  with  a  very  dark  line  the  entire  figure,  to %0amake  it  stand  out.  With  us,  also,  at  the  Romane  epoch,  a  deep  line %0awas  hollowed  out  round  a  sculptured  figure  to  give  it  relief. %0a%0a**  Then  a  few  strokes  of  the  pencil^  of  a  rosy  white,  are  given %0ahere  and  there,  to  subdue  the  vivacity  of  the  red  in  certain  parts %0aof  the  flesh ;  then  a  few  strokes  of  brown  for  the  wrinkles  of  the %0aaged;  and  at  last  a  few  strokes  of  different  colours,  to  give  the %0alast  touch  to  the  heads  and  to  finish  them. %0a%0a"  Two  heads  arc  painted  together,  as  I  saw  Father  Joasaph  prac- %0atise; he  was  scarcely ^n  hour  in  doing  both.    In  five  days  Joasaph %0a%0a'  The  glycasm,  under  the  circumstances,  would  appear  to  M.  Didron  a  "  blackish  " %0acolour,  and  the  flesh  tints,  different  degrees  of  "  yellow." %0a%0a%0aNOTR8   TO    BOOK    I.  93 %0a%0ahad  painted  a  Conversion  of  St.  Paul  in  fresco,  a  picture  of  three %0ametres  in  breadth  and  four  in  height.  Twelve  personages  and %0athree  large  horses  occupied  this  rather  extensive  field.  This %0apainting  was  certainly  not  a  masterpiece,  but  it  was  better  than %0athat  which  would  cost  one  of  our  painters,  of  the  second  order, %0afrom  six  to  eight  months.  I*  even  doubt  that  our  great  painters, %0acharged  with  a  religious  composition,  would  execute  it  more  uni- %0aformly well;  there  would  be  more  excellencies,  but  more  faults %0aalso  in  their  work  than  in  the  fresco  of  Mount  Athos. %0a%0a'^Wlien  the  picture  is  finished,  they  wait  until  the  lime  has %0aalmost  entirely  dried;  they  then  finish  the  figures.  They  attach %0agold  and  silver  to  the  nimbus  and  to  garments,  they  enrich  the %0apaintings  with  the  finest  colours,  particularly  Venetian  azure,  and %0athey  make  the  flowers  and  ornaments  which  decorate  the  interior %0aof  the  nimbus,  the  stuffs  of  habits,  the  ground  of  the  picture. %0aFor  this,  the  grosser  colours,  which  were  used  to  paint  the  figures, %0amust  be  very  dry,  so  that  they  may  neither  spoil  the  precious %0acolours,  nor  the  silver  or  gold.  The  figure  finished,  it  is  named. %0aA  special  artist,  a  writer,  inserts  the  name  of  the  personage  in  the %0afield  or  nimbus,  or  about  it :  he  traces  upon  the  cartel  which  the %0afigure  holds,  patriarch,  prophet,  judge,  king,  apostle,  or  saint, %0athe  consecrated  legend,  which  the  ^  *  guide  of  painting '  com- %0amands.

While  the  painter  was  at  work %0aI  interrogated  him,  and  wrote  upon  the  spot,  and  as  under  his %0adictation,  what  I  saw  and  heard.  They  scarcely  ever  paint  in  oil, %0abecause,  said  Father  Joasaph,  to  paint  in  oil  we  must  wait  until  the %0aplaster  has  become  dry,  and,  as  the  colour  would  not  penetrate %0ainto  the  lime,  it  would  be  less  solid." %0a%0a%0aFrom  these  extracts  it  will  be  seen  that  sand  or  silica  is  dis- %0apensed with  in  the  composition  of  the  stucco>  the  peculiar  action %0aof  which,  by  hastening  the  setting  of  tlie  plaster,  so  much  annoys %0athe  fresco  painter.  The  binding  of  the  lime  is  produced  by  me- %0achanical means,  instead  of  the  chemical  action  which  the  process %0aof  Vitruvius  and  the  later  Italians  undergoes;  this  would,  by  re- %0atarding the  setting  of  the  cement,  obviate  the  necessity  of  piece- %0ameal work,   which   is  not   spoken  of  in  the  Athos   MS.

The  black  pigments  used  by  the  ancients  were, %0aaccording  to  the  Greek  and  Roman  writers,  either  black  earths  or %0acarbonised  vegetable  substances,  as  in  the  present  day^. %0a%0aIn  the  *'  Tab.

He  adds,  '*  but  vine  twigs  become  of  a  blacker  co- %0alour if  steeped  in  the  best  wine  and  afterwards  burnt,  gluten  being %0aadded." %0a%0aIn  the  Sloane  MS.  1754,  of  the  fourteenth  century,  the  black %0adirected  to  be  used  is  vine  black,  ''  nigrum  optimum  ex  carboni- %0abus  vitis." %0a%0aCennino  Cennini  speaks  of  blacks  of  many  kinds.  '*  Negro,  egli %0a^  una  pietra  negra,  tenera,  e'l  colore  e  grasso."

Parophilus,  the  master  of  Apelles^  is  stated  to  have  in- %0atroduced many  novelties  into  the  art ;  he  is  asserted  by  Pliny  to %0ahave  painted  in  a  different  style  from  former  painters  and  to  have %0abeen  in  the  habit  of  painting  small  tablet  pictures  ^.  These  re- %0amarks, however  vague,  coupled  with  the  invention  of  the  *'  atra- %0amentum  **  of  his  pupil,  Apelles,  may  cause  us  to  enquire  whether %0a"  oil "  was  unknown  to  Pamphilus  ? %0a%0aThe  first  mention  I  can  find  of  the  use  of  oil  in  painting  is  by %0aVitruvius  ^  who  directs  that  Punic  wax  be  mixed  with  oil  in  the %0apreparation  of  walls  for  receiving  colours,  and  for  the  application %0aof  colours,  which  will  not  bear  lime,  in  coating  walls.  This  is  an %0aencaustic  process,  however. %0a%0aPliny  gives  the  same  directions  as  Vitruvius  ^  This  author %0alikewise  mentions  walnut  oil  by  the  Greek  term  **  Caryinum."' %0a%0aThe  Roman  writers  drew  their  knowledge  upon  these  subjects %0afrom  the  Greeks,  who  were  their  masters  in  all  the  arts  of  luxury %0aand  elegance ;  more  inventive  and  theoretical  than  the  Romans, %0athese  propagated  the  literature,  sciences  and  arts,  which  the  latter %0adid  but  practically  adopt.

These  chapters  have  all  the %0aproofs  of  authenticity,  and  are  the  source  from  which  many  of  the %0aearly  MS.  writers  have  drawn. %0a%0a"  De  oleo,  quomodo  aptatur  ad  distemperandum  colores."

After- %0awards strain  it  and  keep  it,  and  distemper  colours  with  it." %0a%0aThis  is  a  very  curious  as  well  as  valuable  passage.  It  is  not %0aonly  a  proof  of  the  attainment  of  a  great  perfection  in  the  art  of %0apainting  "  oil "  as  a  material  for  tempering  colours  in  painting,  but %0ait  is  almost  as  good  a  formula  for  the  preparation  of  a  drying  oil  as %0acould  at  this  day  be  given.  A  patent  has  lately  been  taken  out  for %0atreating  oil  with  fresh  slacked  lime  during  the  process  of  preparing %0aa  drying  oil  with  the  per-oxide  of  lead ;  we  here  find  the  same %0ameans  employed  during  the  ninth  or  tenth  century,  probably  long %0abefore  that  time,  for  it  was  impossible  that  the  Greeks  could  have %0aoverlooked  the  action  of  the  metallic  oxides  of  lead  or  zinc  upon %0aoil  of  linseed:  the  "  plumbum  combustum  et  oleum/'  '' massicot,  or %0aminium  and  oil,"  of  Cornelius  Oelsus  and  the  other  Roman %0awriters  on  medicine,  produced  effects  which  could  not  have  been %0aoverlooked.     Marcellus,  who  wrote  under  the  empire  of  Marcus %0a%0aH %0a%0a%0a98  NOTEB   TO    BOOK    I. %0a%0aAurelius^  has  given  a  singular  recipe  for  a  ''drying  oil"  for  the %0atime  in  which  he  wrote ;  although  not  intended  as  such :  ^ %0a%0a''  Oleum  vetus^  quantum  roittendum  fuerit  pro  modo  specierum %0asupra  scriptarum,  mittes  in  ollam  novam,  et  calefacies  leni  flamma %0avel  potius  igne,  tunc  mittes,  sed  paulatim  et  manu  inspergens, %0alythargyrum  bene  tritum,  et  assidue  spathomela  agitabis,  postea %0aaut  picem  brutiam  tritam  mittes/'^  &c. %0a%0aIn  describing  the  method  of  painting  on  wood  or  stone,  Eraclius %0adirects  that  the  wood  or  stone  be  well  dried  in  the  sun  or  at  the %0afire ;  after  this,  white  oil  colour  is  to  be  painted  over  it  two  or  three %0atimes  with  a  fiat  brush ;  afterwards  it  is  to  be  primed  with  the %0ahand  or  brush  with  a  thick  white  oil  paint ;  this,  when  half  dry,  is %0ato  be  smoothed  with  the  hand,  until  all  is  as  smooth  as  glass  :  he %0aadds^  «  you  can  then  paint  upon  it  with  all  colours  distempered  with %0aoil,'*  '*  tunc  vero  desuper  poteris  de  omnibus  coloribus  et  cum  oleo %0adistemperatis  pingere."  Nothing  can  be  clearer  than  this ;  and %0athat  pictorial  or  other  ornamental  work  is  intended,  is  evident,  for %0ahe  follows  with  a  direction  for  "  marbling,"  "  if  you  prefer  it ; "  the %0awhole  afterwards  to  be  varnished  in  the  sun. %0a%0aTheophiius,  however,  who  professes  to  teach  "  all  that  Greece %0aknew  in  the  art  of  painting,**  ends  all  doubt  upon  the  subject  of  the %0aemployment  of  "  oil  colours "  for  pictures  in  his  twenty-sixth %0achapter.  Upon  a  varnished  ground  of  tin  leaf  fixed  upon  wood  he %0adirects — "  Take  the  colours  which  you  wish  to  lay  on,  grinding %0athem  carefully  in  linseed  oil,  without  water,  and  make  the  tints  of %0acountenances  and  draperies,  as  you  have  done  above,  with  water; %0aand  you  will  vary  with  their  colours  beasts,  birds,  or  leaves,  as  it %0amay  please  you."  The  reluctance  to  part  with  a  long  received %0aimpression  must  therefore  be  set  aside :  and  it  must  be  allowed  that %0athe  Greeks  certainly,  most  probably  the  Egyptians,  knew  the  ad- %0avantage of  oil  as  a  vehicle  for  pigments. %0a%0aIn  the  MS.  from  Mount  Athos  a  recipe  for  preparing  a  drying %0aoil  is  given.  The  oil  intended  is  most  likely  linseed,  but  I  have %0anot  been  able  to  trace  the  origin  of  the  word  ni^p»,  Peseri'*. %0a"  How  to  prepare  peseri : " %0a%0a''  Take  peseri  and  put  it  into  a  large  metal  basin ;  expose  it  to %0aan  ardent  sun  forty  days.

You  will  therefore  be  careful  to  cover  it  every  even- %0aing, or  to  take  it  into  the  house,  for  the  dew  of  the  night  injures %0ait.

I  give  the  old  French %0areceipt:  **  Si  vous  voulez  appareiller  oile  pour  detremper  toutes %0amanieres  de  couleurs,  prenez  chaux  vive,  avec  autant  de  ceruse %0acomme  est  Voile.

The  instances  produced  by  Walpole, %0aPownall,  and  others,  likewise  place  beyond  a  doubt  the  fact  that %0apainting  in  oil  was  practised  in  pictorial  decoration  in  our  own %0acountry  before  the  thirteenth  century;  and  Muratori'"^  concludes %0athat  "  the  art  of  painting  was  never  wholly  lost  in  any  of  those %0acountries  which  had  once  been  provinces  of  the  Roman  empire." %0a%0aPallidus,  c.  1.

They %0aalso  cause  both  their  shields  and  saddles  to  be  painted  with  the %0arepresentations  of  battles  and  equestrian  combats,  that  they  may %0aplease  their  imaginations  with  the  contemplation  of  scenes  in %0awhich  they  do  not  choose  to  engage."  ^ %0a%0aSiKOPis,  c.  1 .  Theophrastus  tells  us  that  £»»on-ix{i'  or  Sinopic  earth %0awas  dug  in  Cappadocia,  but  carried  to  Sinope  for  sale ;  also,  "  that %0athere  were  three  kinds  of  the  Sinopic :  one  of  a  deep  red  colour ; %0aanother  pale ;  the  third  of  a  middle  colour  between  the  two^  which %0awas  called  the  pure  and  simple  kind,  because  it  was  used  without %0amixing,  whereas  they  mix  the  others."  ^  He  adds,  "  there  is  also %0aa  kind  of  sinoper  made  from  ochre,  by  burning,  the  invention  of %0aCidias,  who  observed  that  some  ochre,  in  a  house  on  fire,  when %0ahalf  burnt  assumed  a  red  colour."  ^  Sinopis  thus  became  a  gene- %0aral name  for  all  the  red  ochreous  earths  or  reddles,  the  *%3c  miltos  " %0aof  the  Greeks,  and  "rubrica'*  of  the  Romans. %0a%0aThe  MiXTOf  of  Theophrastus  is  certainly  no  other  than  the  red %0aochreous  earth  or  ore  which  owes  its  colour  to  iron.  He  gives %0athe  different  varieties  of  miltos,  and  tells  us  that  "  the  best  came %0afrom  Cea^,  particularly  that  which  was  taken  from  the  reddle  pits; %0a%0a*  Op.

There  are  also, %0abesides  these,  the  Lemnian  and  Sinopic  miltos;  there  are  par- %0aticular pits  in  Lemnos,  in  which  nothing  but  the  earth  is  dug."  ^ %0a%0aThe  Lemnian  miltos  must  not,  however,  be  confounded  with %0athe  "cr^^tityK,"  or  ''terra  sigillata."  The  sealed  earth,  used  in %0amedicine,  was  an  unctuous  clay,  of  a  pale  red  colour,  which  was %0amixed  by  the  priests  alone,  with  the  blood  of  goats  sacrificed, %0aand  then  sealed  by  them.  It  was  the  '*  Lemnian  reddle,"  not  the %0a"Lemnian  earth,"  which  was  used  by  painters  ^  Pliny  con- %0afounds the  two  substances'*. %0a%0aSalmasius  was  the  first  to  detect  an  important  error  in  the %0adifferent  editions  of  Pliny,  and  to  restore  a  passage,  according  to %0ahis  judgment,  to  the  original  intention  of  the  author  \ %0a%0aThe  passage ^  ''Milton  vocant  Graeci  minium^  quidam  cinna- %0abari^"  "  the  Greeks  call  minium  miltos,  some  cinnabar,"  has  been %0arestored  by  him  to  "(Rubicam)  milton  vocant  Grseci^  minium  que %0acinnabari ; "  a  statement  which  would  be  certainly  correct,  and %0atherefore  fairly  attributable  to  Pliny,  many  of  whose  ** errors*' %0ahave  been  more  the  mistakes  of  his  commentators  than  his  own. %0a%0aSalmasius  thus  restores  the  whole  passage :  "  Jam  enim  Tro- %0ajanis  temporibus  rubrica  in  honore  erat,  qui  naves  ea  commendat> %0aalias  circa  picturas,  pigmentaque  rarus,  milton  vocant  Graeci, %0aminiumque  cinnabari."  The  milton  certainly  relates  to  the  ru- %0abrica. Hill  remarks  \  that  "  Homer,  speaking  of  the  (|#«ciaii %0aships,  writes  'Nna;  ^iXTovft^^i/%3c,'  and  that  it  is  imprssiible  he %0ashould  mean  by  it  that  they  were  stained  with  minium  or  cin- %0anabar, which  was  not  known  till  after  his  time." %0a%0aThis  correction  of  an  error  which  has  so  long  existed,  and %0abeen  variously  propagated,  is  certainly  important.  Sinoper  or %0amiltos  has  been  used  as  a  colour  from  time  immemorial,  and  we %0ahave  proof  that  the  Egyptians  used  it :  the  Assyrians  likewise. %0aEzekiel,  c.  xxiii.,  v.  14,  speaks  of  *'men  portrayed  upon  the  wall, %0athe  likeness  of  the  Chaldeans  portrayed  with  sinoper."

The  trit-oxide,  or  purple  oxide,  is  the  highest  point  of %0aoxidation.  The  greater  proportion  of  clay  which  the  yellow  or %0ared  ochres  possess,  the  brighter  will  be  the  colour.

It  was  the  more  valued %0a%3c as  it  approached  the  colour  of  gold.

In  article  261,  tliis  author  tells  us  how  they %0a%3c prepared  orpiment  for  painting :  "  Break  up  orpiment  in  a  skin, %0a%3c then  grind  it  with  water  upon  a  marble,  adding  to  it  a  little  cal- %0a%3c cined bone,  and  again  allow  it  to  dry,  temper  it  afterwards  with  egg %0a%3c for  laying  upon  wo|od,  or  on  a  wall.

I  am  in  possession  of  the  several  modes  prac- %0a%3c tised for  its  use,  at  a  later  day,  when  orpiment  was  in  constant %0a%3c use  by  the  Italian  painters,  but  these  are  reserved  for  a  future %0a%3c opportunity. %0a%3c %0a%3c When  the  yellow  sulphuret  of  arsenic  is  heated,  it  parts  with  a %0a%3c portion  of  the  sulphur,  and  the  substance  becomes  converted  into %0a%3c red  orpiment,  or  "  Realgar." %0a%3c %0a%3c Cennino  mentions  the  two  colours ;  *'  Oropimento,"  the  yellow, %0a%3c and  '*  Risigallo,"  the  red  sulphuret,  or  Realgar  ^ %0a%3c %0a%3c C£Ro$A,  c.  1.  The  fabrication  of  that  colour  which  the  Greeks %0a%3c called  ^I't/Avdi*»,  psimuthion,  and  the  Romans  Cerusa,  or  psimythin, %0a%3c is  described  by  Theophrastus^  Dioscoride8'\  Vitruvius^  and  Pliny  ^ %0a%3c in  nearly  the  same  terras,  and  they  speak  of  it  as  a  colour  com- %0a%3c monly used  in  painting.  Theophrastus  thus  describes  the  process. %0a%3c '*  To  make  which,  lead  is  placed  in  earthen  vessels  over  sharp %0a%3c vinegar,  and  after  it  has  acquired  some  thickness  of  a  kind  of  rust, %0a%3c which  it  commonly  does  in  about  ten  days,  they  open  the  vessels %0a%3c and  scrape  it  off,  as  it  were,  in  a  kind  of  impurity ;  they  then  re- %0a%3c place (the  lead)  over  the  vinegar,  repeating  often  the  same  method %0a%3c of  scraping,  till  it  is  wholly  dissolved,  they  then  beat  what  has %0a%3c been  scraped  off  into  powder,  and  boil  for  a  long  time,  and  what %0a%3c at  last  subsides  to  the  bottom  of  the  vessel  is  the  psimuthion." %0a%3c %0a%3c Pliny  describes  the  process  nearly  in  the  same  terms. %0a%3c %0a%3c Dioscorides  adds  that  the  principal  manufactories  of  ceruse  were %0a%3c at  Rhodes,  at  Corinth,  at  Lacedemon  and  Pozsuoli. %0a%3c %0a%3c Vitruvius  informs  us  that  the  Rhodians  put  vine  twigs,  or  ten- %0a%3c drils, in  barrels,  into  which  they  poured  vinegar,  over  this  were %0a%3c suspended  sheets  of  lead  and  the  barrels  were  closed  up.  After %0a%3c a  certain  time  the  lead  was  found  changed  into  ceruse,  and %0a%3c Pliny  states  that  the  Rhodian  ceruse  was  the  most  esteemed, — %0a%3c "  Laudatissimum  in  Rhodo."

L.  1. %0a%3c c.  39.  In  the  MS.  British  Museum,  Sloane  1754,  ceruse  is  called %0a%3c *%3c  Minium  Album."  This  MS.  is  of  the  early  half  of  the  four- %0a%3c teenth century^. %0a%3c %0a%3c The  use  of  ceruse  as  a  pigment  is  confined  by  Theophilus  to %0a%3c plaster  work,  wood,  or  canvass.  Sir  H.  Davy  in  his  analysis  of  the %0a%3c colours  of  the  ancients  ^  found  that  the  whites  he  examined  *'  were %0a%3c all  fine  chalk,"  yer,  that  Davy  did  not  find  white  lead  used  upon  a %0a%3c mural  decoration  is  no  proof  that  it  did  not  enter  into  the  other %0a%3c decorations,  or  pictures,  of  the  Romans,  used  in  encaustic,  or  with %0a%3c gums,  gluten,  or  oil  upon  plaster  work. %0a%3c %0a%3c The  white  lead  of  the  present  period  is  a  combination  of  prot- %0a%3c oxide of  lead  with  carbonic  acid,  and  is  a  sub-carbonate  of  lead. %0a%3c It  is  prepared,  at  Clichy,  by  forming  a  precipitate,  with  carbonic %0a%3c acid  gas,  in  a  saturated  solution  of  prot-oxide  of  lead  in  distilled %0a%3c vinegar.  The  current  of  carbonic  acid  gas  is  passed  through  this %0a%3c solution,  and  the  precipitate  is  washed  and  dried. %0a%3c %0a%3c A  patent  was  recently  taken  in  London  for  a  means  of  manu- %0a%3c facturing white  lead  by  one  process  from  the  metal.  Very  small %0a%3c shot  was  violently  agitated  in  water,  by  which  a  pulverulent %0a%3c hydaated  oxide  was  produced.  This,  having  been  exposed  to  the %0a%3c air,  became  converted  into  a  carbonate. %0a%3c %0a%3c Had  this  powder  been  exposed  to  the  action  o£  carbonic  acid  gas %0a%3c in  a  close  chamber,  a  fine  carbonate  of  lead  would  have  been  pro- %0a%3c duced fit  for  the  artist;  as  it  was^  the  patent  was  not  much  valued,  as %0a%3c two  processes  would  have  been  necessary  during  the  manufacture. %0a%3c %0a%3c Cenobrium,  c.

Hill  in  his  notes  to  Theophrastus^  thinks %0a%3c that  this  latter  substance  was  the  **  Sil  Atticum  "  of  the  Romans, %0a%3c injudiciously  confounded,  he  states,  by  Vitruvius  with  the  Ochra %0a%3c Attica  of  the  ancients.  Hill,  however,  produces  no  reason  or %0a%3c support  for  this  assertion.  The  **  Sil  Atticum,"  was  of  a  golden %0a%3c colour,  which  was  altered  in  its  hue  by  burning.  The  origin  of  the %0a%3c term  is  probably  a-iXat,  fulgor,  auro  similis. %0a%3c %0a%3c There  were  the  **  Sil  Atticum,"  Marmorosum^  and  Pressum,  vel %0a%3c Syricum. %0a%3c %0a%3c The  factitious  cinnabar  was  more  likely  a  true  minium,  die  in- %0a%3c vention or  introduction  of  Callias  the  Athenian.     (See  Minium.) %0a%3c %0a%3c The  **  Native  Cinnabar,"  however,  of  Theophrastus  was  identical %0a%3c with  ours,  it  was  vermilion,  or  sulphuret  of  quicksilver,  and  that %0a%3c writer  relates  the  process  of  extracting  the  metal  from  the  ore  by %0a%3c *'  rubbing  it  with  vinegar  with  a  brass  pestle  in  a  brass  mortar."^ %0a%3c During  this  process  the  brass  would  be  attacked  by  the  acid,  and, %0a%3c through  the  affinity  of  the  copper  for  the  sulphur,  the  cinnabar %0a%3c would  be  reduced  to  the  metallic  state. %0a%3c %0a%3c Dioscorides  tells  that  '*  a  cinnabar  is  worked  in  Spain  ^,  and  that %0a%3c during  the  operation  the  workmen  cover  the  face  with  a  skin %0a%3c because  of  the  (mercurial)  vapours  dangerous  to  inhale;"  he  like- %0a%3c wise describes  the  process  of  extracting  quicksilver  from  cinnabar. %0a%3c %0a%3c Pliny,  likewise,  describes  a  **  Cinnabar  or  Minium  "  **  whose  pro- %0a%3c duce we  have  called  quicksilver,"  "  cujus  vomicam  argentum  vivum %0a%3c appellavimus."^ %0a%3c %0a%3c Cinnabar  was  the  *%3c  Minium"  of  Vitruvius^  who  gives  a  process %0a%3c for  using  it  in  staining  walls  of  a  red  colour'. %0a%3c %0a%3c Cinnabar  has  been  confounded  with  the  "  Miltos"  of  Uie  Greeks, %0a%3c which  is  a  red  ochreous  earth  and  the  most  ancient  red  colour %0a%3c known.

Put  it  into  the  above  bottle, %0a%3c which  you  afterwards  place  on  four  stones,  and,  laying  a  very %0a%3c slight  fire  of  coals  round  the  bottle,  cover  its  mouth  with  a  tile, %0a%3c and  when  you  see  the  smoke  come  white  from  the  mouth  of  the %0a%3c bottle,  close  it,  but  when  a  smoke  as  red  as  the  vermilion  shall %0a%3c come  out,  take  it  from  the  fire  and  you  will  have  the  best  ver- %0a%3c milion."

This %0a%3c allusion  to  our  country  at  so  early  a  period  is  not  a  little  curious %0a%3c in  the  history  of  the  arts.  The  action  of  the  acid  or  alkaline  sub- %0a%3c stances with  which  these  vegetable  purples  or  blues  were  mixed %0a%3c would  of  course  influence  their  colour. %0a%3c %0a%3c The  '*  morella,"  was  a  species  of  "  solanum"  bearing  a  dark %0a%3c berry  or  seed.  The  turnsol  was  used  for  making  a  violet  colour^ %0a%3c the  fruit  of  the  mulberry  tree,  the  elderberry,  the  petals  of  the %0a%3c violet  and  many  vegetable  colours  which  must  have  been  very  little %0a%3c permanent  even  in  illuminated  books. %0a%3c %0a%3c Varantia,  Warancia,  Warantz  or  Garance,  our  Madder,  was %0a%3c likewise  employed  by  the  ancients. %0a%3c %0a%3c Dioscorides  uses  the  same  term  for  madder  which  the  Oreeks %0a%3c of  the  present  day  employ,  ipi/0f^»»o».  The  "  rubia  tinctorum"  of %0a%3c the  Romans  and  the  rubia  major  of  the  mediaeval  chemists,  in %0a%3c order  to  distinguish  it  from  the  rubia  minor^  or  bugloss,  of  the %0a%3c alkanet,  or  anchusa  species. %0a%3c %0a%3c The  **  Hysginum"  of  Vitruvius>  which  has  been  confounded  by %0a%3c his  commentators^  with  vaccinium  (violet)  and  hyacinthum,  (dark %0a%3c purple,)  is  the  '*  alga  tinctoria'*  or  '*  lichen  rocella*'  of  the  modems, %0a%3c the^orseiile'  of  the  French."

Pliny  ^  tells  us  the  same  thing ;  the  same  author  iden- %0a%3c tifies the  purple  of  hysginum  with  that  of  Pozzuoli^.

Pliny  here  uses  sandyx,  for  burnt  ochre,  and %0a%3c minium  for  red  lead.  '*  If  they  wish  rather  to  make  a  purple  colour, %0a%3c they  underlay  blue,  then  they  overlay  the  purpurissimum  with  egg." %0a%3c %0a%3c Xenophon,  Cyr.  viii.  3.  7,  writes  ^(r/iraj3£^ic,  dyed  purple. %0a%3c %0a%3c Sir  H.  Davy  states^  that  a  pale  rose  colour  was  found  in  a  vase %0a%3c in  the  Baths  of  Titus,  that  the  colouring  matter  was  vegetable, %0a%3c and  that  it  was  mixed  with  a  considerable  quantity  of  carbonate  of %0a%3c lime,  .(chalk.)  He  proceeds,  **  It  differed  from  madder^  as  the %0a%3c madder  lake  gave  a  much  deeper  tint  to  muriatic  acid  and  pro- %0a%3c duced a  tawny  hue  when  its  weak  muriatic  solution  was  acted  on %0a%3c by  muriate  of  iron.  The  ancient  lake  did  not  change  its  colour. %0a%3c The  ancient  lake  agreed  with  the  lake  of  co(;hineal  in  being  ren- %0a%3c dered of  a  deeper  hue  by  weak  alkalies,  and  of  a  brighter  hue  by %0a%3c weak  acids,  but  it  differed  from  it  in  being  much  more  easily  de- %0a%3c stroyed by  strong  acids.  It  agreed  with  both  in  being  immediately %0a%3c destroyed  by  a  solution  of  chlorine." %0a%3c %0a%3c Was  this  colour  *'orceine?"  (the  colouring  matter  of  the %0a%3c "  lichen  roccella"  and  the  hysginum  of  the  ancients.)  If  so,  this %0a%3c valuable  colour  seen  by  Davy,  and  which  astonished  all  who  saw %0a%3c it,  should  not  be  neglected. %0a%3c %0a%3c In  the  Tab.  Voc.

A  purple  colour  is  also  made  from  the %0a%3c stone,  sil,  burnt,  and  extinguished  in  vinegar  while  it  is  glowing. %0a%3c Oster  is  a  fish,  of  the  sea  or  elsewhere,  from  which  a  purple  colour %0a%3c is  made,  or  from  its  blood ;  and  also  the  sea  conchse,  when  cut, %0a%3c make  a  purple  colour.

The  fine  specimens  of %0a%3c the  Arabit  sandarac,  which  exactly  resemble  the  choice  "  Thus,"  viz. %0a%3c the  T.  masculinum,  corticosum,  and  feminoeum  of  the  ancients, %0a%3c pointed  out  that  resin,  for  it  has  the  distinguishing  mark,  a  bright %0a%3c glassy  fracture,  which  the  Thus  has  not ;  or,  as  Theophilus  writes^ %0a%3c "  sed,  cum  frangitur,  fulgorem  clariorem  reddit" %0a%3c %0a%3c But  the  term  '*  fornis "  which  is  given  to  the  resin  will    still %0a%3c more  strongly  designate  Sandarach,  if  it  can  be  shown  that  this %0a%3c «ame  has  been  applied  to  that  gum  resin. %0a%3c %0a%3c In  the  second  process  given  by  Theophilus  for  making  the %0a%3c "  Gluten  Vernition,"  he  calls  the  same  gum  fornis  "  Glassa," %0a%3c **  supra  dictum  gummi  fornis,  quod  Romane  glassa  dicitur," %0a%3c (*'  aliter  Arabtcum,'*  an  interpolation  in  the  Cod.

Cennino,  therefore,  gives  the  receipt  for  making  the %0a%3c '*  vernice  liquida*'  in  the  151  cap.  He  singularly  also  shows  that %0a%3c the  Italians  were  aware  of  the  action  of  metallic  oxides  as  driers. %0a%3c The  directions  are  for  making  a  mordant,  perfect  for  walls,  pictures, %0a%3c upon  glass,  or  iron^  or  anywhere. %0a%3c %0a%3c "  Take  your  oil,  cooked  at  the  fir6,  or  in  the  sun,  by  the  mode %0a%3c which  I  have  before  shown  you.  ,  Grind  with  this  oil  a  little  white %0a%3c and  verdigris;  and  when  you  have  ground  them  as  with  water,  put %0a%3c a  little  vernice  into  it  and  allow  all  to  boil  together  a  little." %0a%3c %0a%3c It  appears  to  me  that  this  passage  has  never  been  rightly  read, %0a%3c the  word  "vernice,"  by  which  Cennino  intended  sandarac,  having %0a%3c been  accepted  as  %3c*  varnish"  or  the  "  vernice  liquida"  itself.

By %0a%3c the  first  process  the  resinous  portion  alone  of  this  gum  resin  would %0a%3c be  dissolved,  unless  the  boiling  were  continued  for  a  very  long %0a%3c time,  so  as  at  last  to  raise  the  heat  to  a  high  degree,  in  order  to %0a%3c keep  the  oil  at  the  simmering  point,  which  becomes  higher  in  pro- %0a%3c portion to  the  loss  of  the  more  volatile  portions  of  the  oil,  which %0a%3c it  will  be  remembered  are  allowed  to  escape,  **  until  a  third  part %0a%3c is  consumed.**  The  varnish,  however,  is  not  perfected  by  the  first %0a%3c process,  and  is  of  a  very  dark  colour.  By  the  second  process  the %0a%3c whole  of  the  resin  may  be  incorporated  with  the  oil  at  once  and  the %0a%3c long  boiling  is  not  required,  nor  does  Theophiius  prescribe  it. %0a%3c The  word  '*  bullire,"  is  used  by  our  author  in  opposition  to %0a%3c "  coquere,"  the  latter  having  the  signification  of  %3c'  to  seeth," %0a%3c the  former  "  to  boil  violently,"  as  "  cestuo  "  "  ferveo,"  against  the %0a%3c danger  of  which  he  cautions  the  artist. %0a%3c %0a%3c The  true  Arabian  sandarac  is  stated  by  Schousboe  S  a  Danish %0a%3c traveller,  to  be  produced  by  the  thuia  articulata,  which  is  a  cy- %0a%3c press.

The  use  of  ink  is  ancient ;  Moses  itientions  it %0a%3c in  Numbers,  v.  2S,  also  Jeremiah,  xxxvi.  18 ;  the  principal  colour* %0a%3c ing  matter  was  smoke  black  combined  with  tannic  acid.  These %0a%3c inks  approach  the  composition  of  the  Chinese  or  Indian  ink  a» %0a%3c made  at  present;  the  Chinese  have  l^td  the  credit  of  the  invention %0a%3c of  ink,  but  it  is  more  probably  of  Egyptian  origin. %0a%3c %0a%3c Coloured  inks  were  used  by  the  Orientals ;  the  emperors  of  the  East %0a%3c had  their  **  sacrum  encaustum,"  which  was  made  with  purple^  and %0a%3c which  was  kept  in  vases  of  gold  enriched  with  gems,  the  guardian- %0a%3c ship of  which  was  entrusted  to  the  royal  officers  ^  and  the  use  of %0a%3c which  was  interdicted  as  a  capital  offence. %0a%3c %0a%3c The  word  "  encaustum "  is  evidently  in  this  case  much  per- %0a%3c verted from  its  original  signification,  it  having  been  first  used  to %0a%3c denote  the  process  of  the  ancient  Greek  painters,  who  applied  heat %0a%3c to  their  colours,  which  were  laid  upon  an  absorbent  surface  with %0a%3c wax,  in  order  to  drive  them  into  the  grounds  upon  which  they %0a%3c %0a%3c *  The  ocque  is  a  weight  used  in  the  Levant,  equal  to  about  three  pounds  and  a %0a%3c half,  English  weight. %0a%3c %0a%3c ■  Nouveau  traits  de  Diplomatique,  T.  1,  p.  654.

Originally  representing  a  dark  colour  or %0a%3c fluid,  it  gradually  was  used  to  denote  diflerent  coloured  fluids  or %0a%3c "  inks"  used  for  various  purposes'. %0a%3c %0a%3c The  fabrication  of  ink  by  means  of  "  Roman  vitriol "  (sulphate %0a%3c of  iron)  and  oak  bark,  (tannic  acid,)  is  of  more  recent  origin, %0a%3c probably  a  century  or  two  before  the  Christian  era. %0a%3c %0a%3c Sir  H.  Davy,  "  on  the  Papyri  in  the  Museum  of  Naples," %0a%3c writes — "  I  looked  in  vain  amongst  the  MSS.  and  in  the  animal %0a%3c charcoal  surrounding  them  for  vestiges  of  letters  in  oxide  of  iron, %0a%3c and  it  would  seem  from  these  circumstances,  as  well  as  from  the %0a%3c omission  of  any  mention  of  such  a  substance  by  Pliny,  that  the %0a%3c Romans,  up  to  his  period,  never  used  the  ink  of  galls  and  iron  for %0a%3c writing.  And  it  is  very  probable  that  the  adoption  of  this  ink  and %0a%3c the  use  of  parchment  took  place  at  the  same  time ;  for  the  ink %0a%3c composed  of  charcoal  and  a  solution  of  glue  can  scarcely  be  made %0a%3c to  adhere  to  the  skin,  whereas  the  free  acid  of  the  chemical  ink %0a%3c partly  dissolves  the  gelatine  of  the  MS.,  and  the  whole  substance %0a%3c adheres  as  a  mordant."  ^ %0a%3c %0a%3c This  is  not  certain ;  Pliny  gives  a  mode  for  detecting  sulphate %0a%3c of  iron  in  sulphate  of  copper  by  the  infusion  of  galls  upon  paper ; %0a%3c he  says  "  it  instantly  blackens."  * %0a%3c %0a%3c Davy  appears  to  have  overlooked  the  following  passage  in  Pliny, %0a%3c which  shows  that  acid  inks  were  known  before  his  time.

Leonardus,  &c.,  &c.,  &c. %0a%3c %0a%3c Theophrastus  tells  us  that  the  sapphire  was  spotted,  as  it  were, %0a%3c with  gold,  **  xf *^^^^C^f •"  Hil^  denies  this  to  be  the  lapis  lazuli, %0a%3c following  De  Boot,  who  writes,  ''  Quam  gemman  Plinius  sapphi- %0a%3c rum  vocat,  cyanus  est,  seu  lapis  lazuli,"  a  double  error,  divided %0a%3c between  both  the  critics. %0a%3c %0a%3c But  Theophrastus  says  that^  "  The  native  cyanus,'*  (or  lapis %0a%3c armenus)  "  ictaw;  «uto^i/jjc"  has  in  it  "  chrysocoUa,"  "  ;^utf^xoXAa»," %0a%3c which,  with  the  ancients,  was  a  green  oxide  of  copper.  Hill  here %0a%3c admits  this  to  mean  the  lapis  armenus,  attempting  to  avoid  the %0a%3c dilemma  by  making  the  cyanus  before  mentioned  a  '*  gem,"  for- %0a%3c getting that  there  were  more  than  one  kind  of  **  cyanus." %0a%3c %0a%3c In  c.  90,  Theophrastus  places  nvatoi,  cyanus,  and  "  chryso- %0a%3c coUa"  among  colours  used  by  painters. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hill,  having  apparently  perplexed  himself,  accuses  Pliny  of  con- %0a%3c fusion ^  and,  having  embroiled  the  question,  asserts  that  Pliny  has %0a%3c misunderstood  Theophrastus.  This  is  both  unlikely  and  erroneous. %0a%3c Pliny  "  De  Jaspidum  generibus"  1.  37.  c.  9,  describes  cyanus, %0a%3c and  after  mentioning,  as  Theophrastus,  that  the  Egyptian  kind  was %0a%3c ''  tinctured,"  proceeds,  *' Dividitur  autem  et  hoc  in  mares  foemi- %0a%3c nasque.

'%3c  Ceruleae  et  sapphiri,  raroque  cum  purpura.

The  Greek  artists  wrote %0a%3c the  name  of  the  personage  represented  either  on  the  nimbus  or %0a%3c glory,  or  on  the  limbus  surrounding  it,  as  the  Greeks  were  for- %0a%3c bidden to  reverence  unknown  images. %0a%3c %0a%3c Manisc,  c.  14.

It  is  remarkable  that  although  Theophrastus  has %0a%3c accurately  described  the  miltos  and  cinnabar  of  the  Greeks,  he %0a%3c has  made  no  mention  of  minium  or  the  "  red  oxide  of  lead." %0a%3c %0a%3c A  great  confusion  of  terms  has  unfortunately  occurred  amongst %0a%3c the  ancient  writers  with  respect  to  minium,  and  numerous  errors %0a%3c have  arisen  from  the  reproduction  of  these  inaccuracies.  The %0a%3c minium  of  the  Romans  was  sometimes  our  "  vermilion,"  or %0a%3c *'  sulphuret  of  mercury,"  sometimes  our  **  minium,"  or  "  prot- %0a%3c oxide of  lead,"  sometimes  the  "  red  ochres,"  as  the  "  minium %0a%3c sinopium"  of  Pliny. %0a%3c %0a%3c Dioscorides '  signalises  this  error.  *%3c  Some  erroneously  believe %0a%3c that  minium  is  identical  with  cinnabar,"  &c«  The  minium  of %0a%3c Dioscorides  was  produced  from  a  galena.  **  For  ^  minium  is  made %0a%3c firom  an  argentiferous  stone  mixed  with  sand."  Was  this  the %0a%3c "artificial  cinnabar"  of  Theophrastus  invented  by  Callias  the %0a%3c Athenian  in  the  reign  of  Praxibulus,  only  ninety  years  before  his %0a%3c time  "  ?

For  in  his  chapter %0a%3c on  **  The  consideration  of  Minium/  ^  he  says«  ^*  Foditur  gleba, %0a%3c quae  anthrax  dicitur"  "  emittit  lachrymas  argenti  vivi."  An- %0a%3c thrax was  a  term  applied  by  the  Greeks  to  gems  or  rare  stones %0a%3c of  a  red  colour;  Vitruvius  evidently  applies  it  to  the  native  cinna- %0a%3c bar, as  %3c*  it  yields  drops  of  quicksilver."  He  calls  the  minium  of %0a%3c the  moderns,  or  red  prot-oxide  of  lead,  '*  sandaracha/'  ^  **  Cerussa %0a%3c vero  cum  in  fornace  coquitur,  mutato  colore  ad  ignis  incendium %0a%3c efficitur  sandaracha." %0a%3c %0a%3c But  Pliny,  better  informed  upon  these  points,  tells  us  that  a %0a%3c minium  is  made  from  a  veined  stone^  from  which  also  silver  is %0a%3c extracted,  not  from  that  whose  liquid  we  call  quicksilver;  "  galena %0a%3c is  evidently  intended,  as  it  is  by  Dioscorides  '\  Yet  he  tells  us %0a%3c that  minium  is  called  cinnabar  by  the  Greeks,  *'  and  that  a  minium %0a%3c called  also  cinnabaris  is  produced  in  the  mines  of  Spain,"  as  at %0a%3c this  day. %0a%3c %0a%3c An  inferior  minium,  the  ''  minium  secundarium  "  of  Pliny,  was %0a%3c made  by  grinding  the  burnt  and  exhausted  lead  ore,  of  a  red %0a%3c colour. %0a%3c %0a%3c In  a  chamber  in  the  Baths  of  Titus  a  bright  red  was  found  in %0a%3c an  earthen  vase.  This  was  analysed  by  Davy,  who  found  that  it %0a%3c fused  into  litharge,  consequently  that  it  was  the  true  "minium" %0a%3c or  red  prot-oxide  of  lead  *. %0a%3c %0a%3c When  massicot  is  calcined  in  a  reverberatory  furnace,  it  gradually %0a%3c assumes  a  dark  purple  colour ;  when  this  has  taken  place,  the %0a%3c doors  should  be  closed,  allowing  the  air  to  enter  very  slowly.  The %0a%3c longer  the  process  of  cooling  the  finer  is  the  minium,  and  the %0a%3c colour  is  heightened  if  it  is  kept  constantly  stirred,  as  more  oxygen %0a%3c is  imbibed.  The  quantity  of  oxygen  taken  up  by  the  lead  is  enor- %0a%3c mous. I  have  been  assured  by  a  practical  chemist,  that  twelve %0a%3c parts  of  lead,  by  weight,  produce  thirteen  of  minium,  if  the  pro- %0a%3c cess has  been  properly  conducted. %0a%3c %0a%3c I  give  an  extract  verbatim  from  the  MSS.  of  Peter  of  St.  Aude- %0a%3c %0a%3c «  Vit.  ae  Aichit.

In  the  former  style  par- %0a%3c ticular colours  are  to  be  used,  mixed  with  lime  to  make  them %0a%3c bind,  "propter  firmitatem,"  chap.  16.  The  dry  wall,  "murus %0a%3c siccus,"  is  saturated  with  water,  and  the  colours  applied  while  it %0a%3c is  wet.  The  whole  dries  together,  c.  15.  This  was  the  Byzantine %0a%3c mode  of  painting  upon  walls>  "  in  humido,"  and  is  quite  a  dif- %0a%3c ferent process  from  that  known  by  the  name  of  **  fresco,"  which %0a%3c was  of  Italian  invention.  When  dry  and  firm,  these  paintings  re- %0a%3c ceived glazings  of  the  rarer  colours  upon  them,  mixed  with  egg, %0a%3c or  other  glarea. %0a%3c %0a%3c Muro,  quomodo  pinoitur  in,  c.  15.  I  have  remarked  elsewhere %0a%3c that  Emeric  David  is  in  error  when  he  states  that  Theophilus  gives %0a%3c directions  for  painting  in  fresco.  Theophilus  nowhere  instructs %0a%3c us  in  the  art  of  fresco  painting,  properly  so  called  and  so  under- %0a%3c stood by  the  Italians  at  a  later  period,  and  by  us  as  '*  fresco %0a%3c buono,"  or  true  fresco.

Theophilus  speaks  of  lime^  only  in  connection  with %0a%3c mural  decoration. %0a%3c %0a%3c Kequeno '  thought  with  reason  that  the  ancients  were  ignorant %0a%3c of  the  style  of  *'buon  fresco/'  and  that  the  directions  of  Vitruvius' %0a%3c "  De  tectoriis  operibus**  were  for  colouring  the  surface  of  the %0a%3c plaster  before  it  hardened.  He  adds  that  Winkelmann  and  the %0a%3c academicians  observed  that  at  Herculaneum,  when  some  of  the %0a%3c paintings  were  washed,  the  colours  of  the  figures,  &c.,  were  re- %0a%3c moved and  the  even  smooth  coloured  ground  only  remained.  Other %0a%3c figures  were  painted  with  "  Punic  wax  and  oil."  Vitruvius  cer- %0a%3c tainly nowhere  speaks  of  painting  upon  cement,  although  he  gives %0a%3c directions  for  colouring  it. %0a%3c %0a%3c The  passage  of  Pliny  ^  "  Ex  omnibus  coloribus  cretulam  amant %0a%3c udoque  illini  recusant,  purpurissimum,  Indicum,  caeruleum,  meli- %0a%3c num,  auripigmentum,  appianum,  cerussa,"  applies  to  the  process %0a%3c described  by  Vitruvius. %0a%3c %0a%3c The  phrase,  however,  of  Theophilus  "  in  recenti  muro"  "  upon  a %0a%3c new  wall**  cannot  be  overlooked.  It  is  not  the  '*  murus  siccus'*  of %0a%3c chap.  15,  but  it  appears  to  mean  that  *' fresco*'  was  intended %0a%3c by  Theophilus.  How  then  to  coincide  the  neglect  of  our  author %0a%3c in  this  instance  with  his  universal  care  in  description,  if  ''  fresco" %0a%3c were  intended?  Theophilus,  who  promises  to  teach  us  all  the  Greeks %0a%3c knew  in  the  art  of  painting,  would  not,  certainly,  have  neglected %0a%3c so  important  a  branch.  The  Byzantine  MS.  published  by  Muratori %0a%3c is  silent  upon  the  subject^  Eraclius  likewise,  as  also  the  writers %0a%3c collected  by  Le  Begue ;  and  it  was  not  until  the  translation  of  the %0a%3c Byzantine  MS.  from  Mount  Athos^  published  by  Mons.  Didron^ %0a%3c appeared,  that  any  light  was  thrown  upon  it;  Theophilus,  although %0a%3c be  has  spoken  generally,  has  neglected  nothing. %0a%3c %0a%3c I  give  a  translation  of  the  chapters  relating  to  %3c'  painting  upon %0a%3c walls"  from  this  MS.,  as  well  as  an  interesting  note  by  M.

For  this,  you  begin  by  placing  a %0a%3c ladder.  Then  take  water  in  a  large  vase,  and  throw  some  with  a %0a%3c spoon  against  the  wall  so  as  to  wet  it.  If  the  wall  is  built  of %0a%3c earth,  scratch  the  earth  with  a  trowel  as  much  as  you  can,  because, %0a%3c above  all  at  the  vault,  the  lime  will  detach  itself  more  tardily. %0a%3c Wet  it  again  and  polish  the  surface.  If  the  wall  is  in  brick,  you %0a%3c will  wet  it  five  or  six  times,  and  you  will  make  the  plaster  work  of %0a%3c lime,  of  the  thickness  of  two  fingers  and  more,  to  retain  humidity^ %0a%3c and  to  allow  you  to  take  advantage  of  it.  If  the  wall  is  in  stone, %0a%3c wet  it  only  once  or  twice^  and  put  a  much  smaller  quantity  of %0a%3c plaster,  for  stone  takes  humidity  easily  and  does  not  dry.  During %0a%3c winter,  lay  one  coat  of  plaster  in  the  evening,  and  another,  more %0a%3c superficial,  the  next  morning.  In  the  fine  season,  do  what  is  the %0a%3c roost  convenient,  and,  after  having  laid  on  the  last  couch  of  plaster, %0a%3c equalize  it  well;  allow  it  to  take  consistence,  and  work." %0a%3c %0a%3c "  HOW   TO   DRAW    WHEN    FAINTING   UPON    WALLS. %0a%3c %0a%3c **  When  you  would  draw  upon  a  wall,  smooth  its  surface  well. %0a%3c Then  take  a  compass,  and  attach  to  both  its  branches  pieces  of %0a%3c wood,  so  as  to  lengthen  it  as  much  as  you  wish.  Attach  a  small %0a%3c brush  (pinceau)  to  the  extremity  of  one  of  these  sticks.  You %0a%3c will  draw  out  the  nimbus  of  your  personages,  and  you  will  indicate %0a%3c all  the  measures  which  are  necessary.  Then  make  a  very  slight %0a%3c sketch  with  ochre;  finish  your  outlines.  If  you  wish  to  correct %0a%3c (effacer)  anything,  employ  oxy  (red  ochre  or  sinoper) .

The  pro- %0a%3c cesses of  this  day  are  the  same,  nearly,  as  those  of  former  times. %0a%3c %0a%3c **  Here,  then,  is  the  manner  in  which  I  saw  a  fresco  painted  in  the %0a%3c Monastery  of  Esphigmenou,  by  Father  Joasaph,  by  his  brother, %0a%3c by  his  first  pupil,  who  was  a  'diacre'  and  the  future  heir  of  the %0a%3c studio,  and  by  two  children  of  twelve  or  fifteen  years  of  age. %0a%3c %0a%3c *'  The  porch  of  the  church,  or  narthex,  which  they  were  painting %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 90  M0TE8   TO   BOOK   I. %0a%3c %0a%3c at  the  time  of  our  passage,  had  just  been  built;  it  was  scaffolded %0a%3c for  receiving  the  fresco  paintings  at  the  upper  part  of  the  vault. %0a%3c Workmen,  under  the  direction  of  the  painters,  prepared  in  the %0a%3c court  the  mixed  lime  which  was  to  serve  as  the  plaster.  As  two %0a%3c plasterings  are  made,  there  are  two  kinds  of  lime ;  the  firsts  a  kind %0a%3c of  mortar  rather  fine,  is  mixed  with  straw  cut  small^  which  gives  it %0a%3c a  yellow  colour ;  in  the  second^  which  is  of  a  finer  quality,  they %0a%3c mix  cotton  or  flax.  It  is  with  the  lime  of  a  yellow  colour  that %0a%3c they  make  the  first  plastering ;  it  adheres  to  the  wall  better  than  the %0a%3c second.  The  second  is  white,  fine,  and  makes  a  rather  firm  paste, %0a%3c by  means  of  the  cotton ;  it  is  this  which  receives  the  painting. %0a%3c %0a%3c **  The  workmen  then  bring  the  yellow  lime  and  apply  upon  the %0a%3c wall  a  layer  of  the  thickness  of  about  half  a  centimetre  \  Upon %0a%3c this  layer,  some  hours  afterwards  they  spread  a  pellicle  of  the  fine %0a%3c and  white  lime.  This  second  operation  demands  more  care  than %0a%3c the  first,  and  I  have  seen  the  brother  of  the  painter  Joasaph,  a %0a%3c painter  himself,  ^PP^y  t^i>  second  couch  of  lime.     Thby  wait %0a%3c %0a%3c TURBE  DAYS   FOR   THE   HUMIDITY   TO   EVAPORATE.      If  tfacy  painted %0a%3c %0a%3c before  that  time,  the  lime  would  soil  the  colours ;  afterwards,  the %0a%3c painting  would  not  be  solid,  and  would  not  enter  into  the  mortar, %0a%3c which  would  be  too  hard,  too  dry  to  absorb  the  colours.  It  need %0a%3c not  be  said  that  the  thermometrical  state  of  the  atmosphere %0a%3c abridges  or  lengthens  the  interval  which  must  be  allowed  to  leave %0a%3c the  plaster  to  dry  suitably  before  painting. %0a%3c %0a%3c **  Before  drawing,  the  master  painter  smooths  the  lime  with  a %0a%3c spatula ;  then,  by  means  of  a  string,  he  determines  the  size  which %0a%3c his  picture  should  have.  Within  this  picture,  on  the  ground  of  his %0a%3c figures,  he  measures  with  a  compass  the  dimensions  which  the  dif- %0a%3c ferent objects,  which  he  wishes  to  represent,  will  have.  The  com- %0a%3c pass which  Father  Joasaph  used  was  simply  a  cane  bent  double, %0a%3c divided  in  the  middle,  and  adjusted  by  a  piece  of  wood,  which %0a%3c united  the  two  branches  and  brought  them  together  or  parted  them %0a%3c at  pleasure.  One  of  the  branches  was  sharpened  to  a  point,  the %0a%3c other  was  furnished  with  a  small  brush,  (pinceau.)  A  compass  of %0a%3c a  more  simple,  commodious,  or  economical  fashion  could  not  be %0a%3c made. %0a%3c %0a%3c '*  The  brush,  which  garnishes  the  extremity  of  one  branch  of  the %0a%3c compass,  is  dipped  into  red ;  it  is  with  this  colour  that  the  draw- %0a%3c %0a%3c *  A  centrimetic  ia,  in  ancient  meaf  uie,  4  lines  and  .4344^  or  about  half  an  Bnglith %0a%3c inch. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c NOTES   TO   BOOK    I.  91 %0a%3c %0a%3c ing  is  slightly  traeed  and  the  picture  sketched.  The  compass %0a%3c serves  principally  for  the  nimbus,  the  heads,  and  the  circular  parts ; %0a%3c the  rest  is  traced  with  the  hand,  which  is  only  armed  with  a  small %0a%3c brush  (pinceau.)  In  less  than  an  hour,  Father  Joasaph  had  traced %0a%3c before  us  an  entire  picture,  in  which  figured  Christ  and  his  Apos- %0a%3c tles, of  the  natural  size;  he  made  this  sketch  entirely  from  idea, %0a%3c without  any  hesitation,  carton  or  model,  and  without  even  looking %0a%3c at  the  figures  already  painted  by  him  in  other  neighbouring  pic* %0a%3c tures.  I  did  not  see  him  efface  or  rectify  a  single  line,  so  sure  was %0a%3c he  of  his  hand.  He  commenced  by  sketching  the  principal  per- %0a%3c sonage, Christ,  who  was  in  the  midst  of  his  Apostles.  He  made %0a%3c first  the  head,  then  the  remainder  of  the  figure  in  descending. %0a%3c Then  he  drew  the  first  Apostle  on  the  right,  then  the  first  on  the %0a%3c lefl,  then  the  second  on  the  right  and  led,  and  so  the  others,  sym- %0a%3c metrically. The  painter  traced  his  sketches,  his  hand  raised  and %0a%3c without  using  a  rest;  this  instrument,  used  by  our  painters,  would %0a%3c enter  the  still  humid  plaster.  However^  the  hand  is  rested  upon %0a%3c the  wall  itself  when  it  trembles,  or  is  fatigued. %0a%3c %0a%3c '*  Inside  this  red  line,  which  defines  the  outline  of  the  figures,  an %0a%3c inferior  painter  spread^  a  black  ground  S  which  he  relieves  with %0a%3c blue,  but  in  a  tint  as  flat  as  the  black  ground  itself.  It  is  upon %0a%3c this  field  that  this  painter,  a  «kind  of  practitioner,  designs  the %0a%3c draperies  and  other  ornaments.  As  to  the  nude,  he  does  not %0a%3c touch  it;  that  is  reserved  for  the  master.  All  the  draperies  are %0a%3c made,  and  the  circular  line  of  the  nimbus  is  traced^  before  the %0a%3c head,  the  feet^  and  the  hands. %0a%3c %0a%3c "  The  master  then  takes  this  sketched  figure,  and  forms  the  head. %0a%3c He  spreads  at  two  different  times  a  couch  of  blackish  colour, %0a%3c (noir&tre,)  over  all  the  face^  and  fixes  the  outline  of  the  face  with %0a%3c a  colour  still  deeper.  He  paints  two  faces  at  once^  going  in- %0a%3c cessantly from  one  to  the  other,  to  exhaust  all  the  colour  con- %0a%3c tained in  the  pencil;  the  colour  of  one  head  must  likewise  have %0a%3c time  to  be  imbibed  into  the  wall  while  the  second  is  preparing. %0a%3c Then  with  a  yellow  colour  he  makes  the  forehead,  cheeks,  neck^ %0a%3c and  the  flesh  parts.     A  first  couch  of  yellow  extinguishes  the %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  This  "black  ground"  most  be  the  proplasm,  which,  while  wet,  would  appear %0a%3c quite  black.  The  mixture  of  blue  would  prepare  for  the  half  tints,  as  in  this  pro- %0a%3c cess the  tights  are  graduated  into  the  shadows,  passing  over  the  prepared  half  tint %0a%3c An  improvement  upon  the  practice  of  Theophilus,  and  of  later  date. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 92  NOTES   TO    BOOK    I. %0a%3c %0a%3c black  colour;  a  second  lightens  the  face^  Here  the  tint  pre- %0a%3c dominates, and  the  tone  should  be  true.  The  painter  tries  the %0a%3c degree  of  colour  upon  the  nimbus,  which  is  traced,  but  not  yet %0a%3c painted,  and  which  serves  him  as  a  palette  under  these  circum- %0a%3c stances. %0a%3c %0a%3c "^  Afler  these  two  couches  of  yellow,  one  which  kills  the  black, %0a%3c the  other  which  lightens  the  flesh,  you  perceive  the  flesh  appear. %0a%3c A  third  couch  of  this  clear  yellow,  thicker  than  tlie  two  first,  gives %0a%3c the  general  tone  of  the  carnations.  The  painter  has  not  made  the %0a%3c face  "  bit  by  bit,*'  but  all  at  once ;  he  spreads  a  couch  over  all  the %0a%3c face  before  passing  to  another  colour.  The  eyes  alone  are  ex- %0a%3c cepted ;  they  are  reserved  for  tlie  end.  Then^  with  a  pale  green, %0a%3c he  softens  the  black,  which  he  has  \eh  in  the  shaded  parts,  and %0a%3c which  he  had  already  enlivened  with  blue.  Then^  with  yellow^  he %0a%3c narrows  the  trespassing  (empietements)  of  the  green. %0a%3c %0a%3c **  This  green,  which  tempers  the  black,  gives  the  shadows.  The %0a%3c flesh  thus  apparent  is  made  to  live  :  he  passes  a  rose  colour  over %0a%3c the  cheeks,  the  lips,  the  eyelids,  to  lighten  them  and  show  the  cir- %0a%3c culation of  the  blood  there.  Then  the  eyebrows  appear  under  a %0a%3c deep  brown,  also  the  hair  and  beard,  and  then  the  outline  of  the %0a%3c face  is  determined. %0a%3c %0a%3c "  The  eyes  have  remained  black,  under  the  two  first  and  general %0a%3c layers.  With  a  deeper  black  he  forms  the  pupil,  and  the  sclerotick %0a%3c with  white;  then  a  pale  and  fine  rose  colour  gives  the  little  lumi- %0a%3c nous point  of  the  eye;  the  eye  is  lit,  and  the  figure  sees. %0a%3c %0a%3c '*  The  lips  were  only  indicated,  the  drawing  of  the  mouth  was  too %0a%3c black ;  the  painter  lightens  and  terminates  the  mouth  and  the  lips. %0a%3c %0a%3c "  He  then  surrounds  with  a  very  dark  line  the  entire  figure,  to %0a%3c make  it  stand  out.  With  us,  also,  at  the  Romane  epoch,  a  deep  line %0a%3c was  hollowed  out  round  a  sculptured  figure  to  give  it  relief. %0a%3c %0a%3c **  Then  a  few  strokes  of  the  pencil^  of  a  rosy  white,  are  given %0a%3c here  and  there,  to  subdue  the  vivacity  of  the  red  in  certain  parts %0a%3c of  the  flesh ;  then  a  few  strokes  of  brown  for  the  wrinkles  of  the %0a%3c aged;  and  at  last  a  few  strokes  of  different  colours,  to  give  the %0a%3c last  touch  to  the  heads  and  to  finish  them. %0a%3c %0a%3c "  Two  heads  arc  painted  together,  as  I  saw  Father  Joasaph  prac- %0a%3c tise; he  was  scarcely ^n  hour  in  doing  both.

Twelve  personages  and %0a%3c three  large  horses  occupied  this  rather  extensive  field.  This %0a%3c painting  was  certainly  not  a  masterpiece,  but  it  was  better  than %0a%3c that  which  would  cost  one  of  our  painters,  of  the  second  order, %0a%3c from  six  to  eight  months.  I*  even  doubt  that  our  great  painters, %0a%3c charged  with  a  religious  composition,  would  execute  it  more  uni- %0a%3c formly well;  there  would  be  more  excellencies,  but  more  faults %0a%3c also  in  their  work  than  in  the  fresco  of  Mount  Athos. %0a%3c %0a%3c '^Wlien  the  picture  is  finished,  they  wait  until  the  lime  has %0a%3c almost  entirely  dried;  they  then  finish  the  figures.  They  attach %0a%3c gold  and  silver  to  the  nimbus  and  to  garments,  they  enrich  the %0a%3c paintings  with  the  finest  colours,  particularly  Venetian  azure,  and %0a%3c they  make  the  flowers  and  ornaments  which  decorate  the  interior %0a%3c of  the  nimbus,  the  stuffs  of  habits,  the  ground  of  the  picture. %0a%3c For  this,  the  grosser  colours,  which  were  used  to  paint  the  figures, %0a%3c must  be  very  dry,  so  that  they  may  neither  spoil  the  precious %0a%3c colours,  nor  the  silver  or  gold.  The  figure  finished,  it  is  named. %0a%3c A  special  artist,  a  writer,  inserts  the  name  of  the  personage  in  the %0a%3c field  or  nimbus,  or  about  it :  he  traces  upon  the  cartel  which  the %0a%3c figure  holds,  patriarch,  prophet,  judge,  king,  apostle,  or  saint, %0a%3c the  consecrated  legend,  which  the  ^  *  guide  of  painting '  com- %0a%3c mands.    Afler wards  it  is  not  touched,  all  is  finished. %0a%3c %0a%3c '*Tbis  is  what  I  observed  with  the  greatest  care  in  the  church  of %0a%3c Esphigmenou,  of  Mount  Athos.  While  the  painter  was  at  work %0a%3c I  interrogated  him,  and  wrote  upon  the  spot,  and  as  under  his %0a%3c dictation,  what  I  saw  and  heard.  They  scarcely  ever  paint  in  oil, %0a%3c because,  said  Father  Joasaph,  to  paint  in  oil  we  must  wait  until  the %0a%3c plaster  has  become  dry,  and,  as  the  colour  would  not  penetrate %0a%3c into  the  lime,  it  would  be  less  solid." %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c From  these  extracts  it  will  be  seen  that  sand  or  silica  is  dis- %0a%3c pensed with  in  the  composition  of  the  stucco>  the  peculiar  action %0a%3c of  which,  by  hastening  the  setting  of  tlie  plaster,  so  much  annoys %0a%3c the  fresco  painter.  The  binding  of  the  lime  is  produced  by  me- %0a%3c chanical means,  instead  of  the  chemical  action  which  the  process %0a%3c of  Vitruvius  and  the  later  Italians  undergoes;  this  would,  by  re- %0a%3c tarding the  setting  of  the  cement,  obviate  the  necessity  of  piece- %0a%3c meal work,   which   is  not   spoken  of  in  the  Athos   MS.

The  black  pigments  used  by  the  ancients  were, %0a%3c according  to  the  Greek  and  Roman  writers,  either  black  earths  or %0a%3c carbonised  vegetable  substances,  as  in  the  present  day^. %0a%3c %0a%3c In  the  *'  Tab.

He  adds,  '*  but  vine  twigs  become  of  a  blacker  co- %0a%3c lour if  steeped  in  the  best  wine  and  afterwards  burnt,  gluten  being %0a%3c added." %0a%3c %0a%3c In  the  Sloane  MS.  1754,  of  the  fourteenth  century,  the  black %0a%3c directed  to  be  used  is  vine  black,  ''  nigrum  optimum  ex  carboni- %0a%3c bus  vitis." %0a%3c %0a%3c Cennino  Cennini  speaks  of  blacks  of  many  kinds.  '*  Negro,  egli %0a%3c ^  una  pietra  negra,  tenera,  e'l  colore  e  grasso."  He  also  speaks  of %0a%3c vine  black  as  well  as  the  black  chalk,  and  of  peach^stone  black  and %0a%3c of  black  made  by  burning  linseed  oil  in  a  recipient. %0a%3c %0a%3c Sir  H.

Two  seated  figures  painted  in  different %0a%3c colours^  one  of  them  red,  particularly  show  this.  Compared  with %0a%3c the  paintings  on  a  fragment  of  wall  opposite  to  these  figures,  and %0a%3c which  are  also  Egyptian^  the  difference  of  the  vehicle  can,  even %0a%3c at  this  lapse  of  time>  be  plainly  observed. %0a%3c %0a%3c Dioacorides,  and  the  Arab  writers  on  medicine  who  follow  him, %0a%3c speak  of  linseed  oil. %0a%3c %0a%3c The  corruption  of  the  word  '*  encaustic'/  has  already  been  re- %0a%3c marked, "  see  Incaustum  ;  "  and  the  signature  **  IfUatv"  ^  or %0a%3c **  enecausen,"  of  the  Greek  artists,  might  well  lose  its  orignal  sig- %0a%3c nification in  painting  also ;  the  term  remaining  while  the  process %0a%3c changed.  Parophilus,  the  master  of  Apelles^  is  stated  to  have  in- %0a%3c troduced many  novelties  into  the  art ;  he  is  asserted  by  Pliny  to %0a%3c have  painted  in  a  different  style  from  former  painters  and  to  have %0a%3c been  in  the  habit  of  painting  small  tablet  pictures  ^.  These  re- %0a%3c marks, however  vague,  coupled  with  the  invention  of  the  *'  atra- %0a%3c mentum  **  of  his  pupil,  Apelles,  may  cause  us  to  enquire  whether %0a%3c "  oil "  was  unknown  to  Pamphilus  ? %0a%3c %0a%3c The  first  mention  I  can  find  of  the  use  of  oil  in  painting  is  by %0a%3c Vitruvius  ^  who  directs  that  Punic  wax  be  mixed  with  oil  in  the %0a%3c preparation  of  walls  for  receiving  colours,  and  for  the  application %0a%3c of  colours,  which  will  not  bear  lime,  in  coating  walls.  This  is  an %0a%3c encaustic  process,  however. %0a%3c %0a%3c Pliny  gives  the  same  directions  as  Vitruvius  ^  This  author %0a%3c likewise  mentions  walnut  oil  by  the  Greek  term  **  Caryinum."' %0a%3c %0a%3c The  Roman  writers  drew  their  knowledge  upon  these  subjects %0a%3c from  the  Greeks,  who  were  their  masters  in  all  the  arts  of  luxury %0a%3c and  elegance ;  more  inventive  and  theoretical  than  the  Romans, %0a%3c these  propagated  the  literature,  sciences  and  arts,  which  the  latter %0a%3c did  but  practically  adopt.

After- %0a%3c wards strain  it  and  keep  it,  and  distemper  colours  with  it." %0a%3c %0a%3c This  is  a  very  curious  as  well  as  valuable  passage.  It  is  not %0a%3c only  a  proof  of  the  attainment  of  a  great  perfection  in  the  art  of %0a%3c painting  "  oil "  as  a  material  for  tempering  colours  in  painting,  but %0a%3c it  is  almost  as  good  a  formula  for  the  preparation  of  a  drying  oil  as %0a%3c could  at  this  day  be  given.  A  patent  has  lately  been  taken  out  for %0a%3c treating  oil  with  fresh  slacked  lime  during  the  process  of  preparing %0a%3c a  drying  oil  with  the  per-oxide  of  lead ;  we  here  find  the  same %0a%3c means  employed  during  the  ninth  or  tenth  century,  probably  long %0a%3c before  that  time,  for  it  was  impossible  that  the  Greeks  could  have %0a%3c overlooked  the  action  of  the  metallic  oxides  of  lead  or  zinc  upon %0a%3c oil  of  linseed:  the  "  plumbum  combustum  et  oleum/'  '' massicot,  or %0a%3c minium  and  oil,"  of  Cornelius  Oelsus  and  the  other  Roman %0a%3c writers  on  medicine,  produced  effects  which  could  not  have  been %0a%3c overlooked.     Marcellus,  who  wrote  under  the  empire  of  Marcus %0a%3c %0a%3c H %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 98  NOTEB   TO    BOOK    I. %0a%3c %0a%3c Aurelius^  has  given  a  singular  recipe  for  a  ''drying  oil"  for  the %0a%3c time  in  which  he  wrote ;  although  not  intended  as  such :  ^ %0a%3c %0a%3c ''  Oleum  vetus^  quantum  roittendum  fuerit  pro  modo  specierum %0a%3c supra  scriptarum,  mittes  in  ollam  novam,  et  calefacies  leni  flamma %0a%3c vel  potius  igne,  tunc  mittes,  sed  paulatim  et  manu  inspergens, %0a%3c lythargyrum  bene  tritum,  et  assidue  spathomela  agitabis,  postea %0a%3c aut  picem  brutiam  tritam  mittes/'^  &c. %0a%3c %0a%3c In  describing  the  method  of  painting  on  wood  or  stone,  Eraclius %0a%3c directs  that  the  wood  or  stone  be  well  dried  in  the  sun  or  at  the %0a%3c fire ;  after  this,  white  oil  colour  is  to  be  painted  over  it  two  or  three %0a%3c times  with  a  fiat  brush ;  afterwards  it  is  to  be  primed  with  the %0a%3c hand  or  brush  with  a  thick  white  oil  paint ;  this,  when  half  dry,  is %0a%3c to  be  smoothed  with  the  hand,  until  all  is  as  smooth  as  glass  :  he %0a%3c adds^  «  you  can  then  paint  upon  it  with  all  colours  distempered  with %0a%3c oil,'*  '*  tunc  vero  desuper  poteris  de  omnibus  coloribus  et  cum  oleo %0a%3c distemperatis  pingere."  Nothing  can  be  clearer  than  this ;  and %0a%3c that  pictorial  or  other  ornamental  work  is  intended,  is  evident,  for %0a%3c he  follows  with  a  direction  for  "  marbling,"  "  if  you  prefer  it ; "  the %0a%3c whole  afterwards  to  be  varnished  in  the  sun. %0a%3c %0a%3c Theophiius,  however,  who  professes  to  teach  "  all  that  Greece %0a%3c knew  in  the  art  of  painting,**  ends  all  doubt  upon  the  subject  of  the %0a%3c employment  of  "  oil  colours "  for  pictures  in  his  twenty-sixth %0a%3c chapter.  Upon  a  varnished  ground  of  tin  leaf  fixed  upon  wood  he %0a%3c directs — "  Take  the  colours  which  you  wish  to  lay  on,  grinding %0a%3c them  carefully  in  linseed  oil,  without  water,  and  make  the  tints  of %0a%3c countenances  and  draperies,  as  you  have  done  above,  with  water; %0a%3c and  you  will  vary  with  their  colours  beasts,  birds,  or  leaves,  as  it %0a%3c may  please  you."  The  reluctance  to  part  with  a  long  received %0a%3c impression  must  therefore  be  set  aside :  and  it  must  be  allowed  that %0a%3c the  Greeks  certainly,  most  probably  the  Egyptians,  knew  the  ad- %0a%3c vantage of  oil  as  a  vehicle  for  pigments. %0a%3c %0a%3c In  the  MS.  from  Mount  Athos  a  recipe  for  preparing  a  drying %0a%3c oil  is  given.  The  oil  intended  is  most  likely  linseed,  but  I  have %0a%3c not  been  able  to  trace  the  origin  of  the  word  ni^p»,  Peseri'*. %0a%3c "  How  to  prepare  peseri : " %0a%3c %0a%3c ''  Take  peseri  and  put  it  into  a  large  metal  basin ;  expose  it  to %0a%3c an  ardent  sun  forty  days.

Theophrastus  tells  us  that  £»»on-ix{i'  or  Sinopic  earth %0a%3c was  dug  in  Cappadocia,  but  carried  to  Sinope  for  sale ;  also,  "  that %0a%3c there  were  three  kinds  of  the  Sinopic :  one  of  a  deep  red  colour ; %0a%3c another  pale ;  the  third  of  a  middle  colour  between  the  two^  which %0a%3c was  called  the  pure  and  simple  kind,  because  it  was  used  without %0a%3c mixing,  whereas  they  mix  the  others."  ^  He  adds,  "  there  is  also %0a%3c a  kind  of  sinoper  made  from  ochre,  by  burning,  the  invention  of %0a%3c Cidias,  who  observed  that  some  ochre,  in  a  house  on  fire,  when %0a%3c half  burnt  assumed  a  red  colour."  ^  Sinopis  thus  became  a  gene- %0a%3c ral name  for  all  the  red  ochreous  earths  or  reddles,  the  *%3c  miltos  " %0a%3c of  the  Greeks,  and  "rubrica'*  of  the  Romans. %0a%3c %0a%3c The  MiXTOf  of  Theophrastus  is  certainly  no  other  than  the  red %0a%3c ochreous  earth  or  ore  which  owes  its  colour  to  iron.  He  gives %0a%3c the  different  varieties  of  miltos,  and  tells  us  that  "  the  best  came %0a%3c from  Cea^,  particularly  that  which  was  taken  from  the  reddle  pits; %0a%3c %0a%3c *  Op.

The  milton  certainly  relates  to  the  ru- %0a%3c brica. Hill  remarks  \  that  "  Homer,  speaking  of  the  (|#«ciaii %0a%3c ships,  writes  'Nna;  ^iXTovft^^i/%3c,'  and  that  it  is  imprssiible  he %0a%3c should  mean  by  it  that  they  were  stained  with  minium  or  cin- %0a%3c nabar, which  was  not  known  till  after  his  time." %0a%3c %0a%3c This  correction  of  an  error  which  has  so  long  existed,  and %0a%3c been  variously  propagated,  is  certainly  important.  Sinoper  or %0a%3c miltos  has  been  used  as  a  colour  from  time  immemorial,  and  we %0a%3c have  proof  that  the  Egyptians  used  it :  the  Assyrians  likewise. %0a%3c Ezekiel,  c.  xxiii.,  v.  14,  speaks  of  *'men  portrayed  upon  the  wall, %0a%3c the  likeness  of  the  Chaldeans  portrayed  with  sinoper."

The %0a%3c nude  feet  of  the  Father  and  Son  are  placed  upon  a  circle  of  fire, %0a%3c winged  with  two  wings  of  flame  ;  it  is  thus  that  the  Greeks  figured %0a%3c the  chorus  of  angels,  to  which  they  gave  the  name  of  Thrones. %0a%3c This  winged  and  flaming  circle  is  as  the  throne  of  the  Divine  feet. %0a%3c Manuel  d'Iconographie  Ghretienne,  i^^  Partie. %0a%3c %0a%3c The  classification  of  angels  by  St.  Denys  I'Areopagite,  is  as %0a%3c follows : — %0a%3c %0a%3c '  Ezadias  de  Artibus  Romanorum.
