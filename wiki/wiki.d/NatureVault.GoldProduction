Then to charge the electrodes use a microwave transformer to produce low radio wave frequency.  This probably explains gold in quartz veins, hydrogen sulfide/telluride/selenide is the ionizable gas, the quartz is the dielectric, the connection with the deep crust/mantle is the wire inside the dielectric tube, and the ground outside the quartz vein is the grounding electrode, and the iron oxide (rust) on the quartz gets hit with the ion plasma.
