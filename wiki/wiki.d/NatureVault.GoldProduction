Iron3iodide is possible but harder to produce than iron2iodide so iodine should be used sparingly for now so it doesn't reduce our iron we are trying to keep +3 to dope for the +4 titanium. Dead sea salts do contain trace iodide but more bromide, and much more chloride. So since these halogens stabilize oxygen vacancies, and doping iron for titanium creates oxygen vacancies, we can mix iron3salicylate with dead sea salt, and then temper the calcium copper titanate with that mix, to create and stabilize oxygen vacancies. Then we can go in with hydrogen sulfide and telluride and a touch of phosphine to swap the halogens with chalcogens and cause the neutron creation and collapse.

Besides lead and mercury, bismuth is probably best followed by gold. Research neutron number [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_number|#]]. Selenium and iodine are also good as is lithium and barium. Iodine is probably a little too volatile and many others aren't volatile enough and will contaminate the product. Tellurium might be ideal since it will volatilize along with the sulfur, so just a little may be needed say 5%25 of the sulfur should be tellurium, selenium would function similarly to tellurium it just has fewer excess neutrons. Phosphorus, boron, tin, bromine also have slight neutron excess. Potassium iodide might be good because it is less volatile than iodine metal and once the iodine volatilizes it would provide hydroxyls for making oxygen vacancies. Actually odd neutron number is probably good [[ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_number|#]] so tellurium (7.9%25 odd) and selenium (7.6%25 odd) are some of the only ones besides berylium and tin. Platinum has highly abundant odd neutron isotope and has excess neutrons so would be a good neutron source. Barium is 17.8%25 odd neutrons and has excess so would also be great, probably as barium titanate which also has even higher piezoelectric coefficient than calcium copper titanate. Titanium has 12%25 odd and a few excess neutrons.%0a%0aWe need max? 3 neutrons for every sulfur atom that is used to make an atom of gold. Each tellurium provides 23 neutrons. This would mean we need 1 mol of tellurium for every 7.667 moles sulfur, however since only 8%25 are fissile perhaps instead of 13%25 moles, 38.2%25 moles te to s would be better. We should also have neutron moderator to create slow neutrons so they are easier for the iron to capture. Water, graphite, beryllium, and hydrocarbons (like [[bone oil]]) can work [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_moderator|#]]. Iron should probably be 1:1 mol:mol to titanium but should be 2x excess. Sulfur should be 1 mol for every 3 mol iron that dopes titanium (so sulfur should be 1:3 mol:mol with titanium - not the excess iron), but should be 3x excess since it will be a gas and a lot will get lost. Carbon (bone oil) should be 1:1? mol:mol with sulfur/te mix but should be 1.5x excess especially since it is a neutron moderator. Excess means should probably have double what is required unless otherwise stated. Boron is a neutron absorber so shouldn't be used, same with normal (light) water.%0a%0aWiki neutron source [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_source|#]]%0aInertial confinement is much more efficient and is from elevated pressure and temperature [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertial_confinement_fusion|#]] and a good vacuum is also needed [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertial_confinement_fusion#ICF_mechanism_of_action|#]] 10x compression leads to 10x reduction in confinement time required for the reaction. 10x compression causes 1000x increase in density.

This might happen naturally with bone oil hydrocarbon and titanate. Metal hydrides like titanium hydride might also beused to produce hydrogen sulfide from sulfur. Pyroelectric crystals (and probably piezoelectric and dielectric) can produce voltages high enough to create neutrons [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_generator#High_voltage_power_supplies|#]]. Pyroelectric fusion uses voltage from a crystal heating cycles to accelerate dueterium to a metal hydride target to produce fusion [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyroelectric_fusion|#]] -34c to 7c over a few mins is all thats needed to create hundreds of kilovolts.

[[https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/materials-science/oxygen-vacancy|#]]%0aPerhaps what the chelator does is make the iron3oxide dielectric constant lower than the dielectric nearby therefore causing oxygen vacancies to form? Or maybe it just makes the iron3oxide a better dielectric.%0a%0aWe know the electron donor is typically HS and acceptor is iron3oxide and the dielectric is the transferrer. The transferrer is like a yoyo electrons being pushed and pulled within the structure. I'm just trying to figure out what the chelator does to the iron oxide, originally I thought to help oxygen vacancies form. Yes if the irons are coordinated with chelators, the oxygens would be free to leave. Or what may be happening is the chelator helps the iron3+ to dope another dielectric-like material thus leading to inherent oxygen vacancies.%0a%0aHydroxyl groups (OH) introduce oxygen vacancies [[https://www.nature.com/articles/s42004-019-0112-9|#]] which means they either coordinate with the metal oxide allowing oxygen to leave or they bond directly to the oxygen pulling it out.%0a%0aOxygen vacancies in metal oxides review [[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/341542284_Oxygen_vacancies_in_metal_oxides_recent_progress_towards_advanced_catalyst_design|#]] ov's increase electrical conductivity. Formed by heat under vacuum, chemical reduction, ion doping (so perhaps chelating iron allows iron to dope out its own oxygens?), And interfacial engineering. Jahn-teller distortion (oxygens get closer) due to different metal replacing (doping) a metal site. This would probably cause the oxygens to combine to O2 and outgas easier? Oxygens can also be reduced with something gas forming like H2 to produce H2O with the oxygens or CO to form CO2 with the oxygens and outgas. Carbon monoxide reduction more thermodynamically favorable than H2 and it actually releases energy instead of costing energy. When the oxygens are removed the bond electrons go to the nearest metal atoms reducing them. Localized electrons will form at the ov's probably from the broken bonds and can this create muons?%0a\\STRATEGIES TO CREATE OVs%0a\\Numerous synthetic strategies have been developed to%0a\\create OVs in metal oxides, e.g., high-energy particle%0a\\bombardment, high-temperature calcination, chemical%0a\\reduction, ion doping, and tuning the heterostructure%0a\\interface, all of which facilitate the escape of O atoms%0a\\Oxygens bound to atoms with more positive charge 3+ for example, or larger ion radius, are more likely to leave. Plasma engraving induces ovs. Higher temperature and longer calcination time in oxygen deficient conditions increases oxygen vacancies as long as it is below pyrolysis temp, but even a couple hundred degrees under decomposition temp may be too high, as co3o4 reduced oxygen vacancies when heated to 700c when decomposition is 900c. Hematite decomposes at 1200-1390c [[https://chemiday.com/en/reaction/3-1-0-5401|#]]. So probably we could combine dielectric with chelated iron oxide and heat to 800c for several hours under vacuum or sealed chamber to create vacancies, carbon monoxide is wood gas. Interestingly doping Fe3+ into a position in a M4+ position can produce high oxygen vacancy iron3oxide. The role of the chelator may be to facilitate the doping of iron into another 4+ cation (M4+) position. Also Fe3+ could substitute in for another M3+ material if the M3+ ion is larger than Fe3+, like perhaps a molybdenum3oxide. The presence of 1 ov speeds up the second and so on. Doping helps achieve the first. Oxygen adjacent to the doped cation more likely to overflow (form O2 gas and leave). Anion doping with N,C,P,F,S in place of oxygen also can work.%0a\\Ov's found near grain boundaries [[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/341542284_Oxygen_vacancies_in_metal_oxides_recent_progress_towards_advanced_catalyst_design|#]] silver Ag promotes oxygen vacancies. Ovs are from breaking m-o bonds and chromium harder than iron which is harder than manganese which is harder than cobalt which is harder than nickel. Ev's related to formation enthalpies of the metal oxide, an indicator of m-o bond strength. Amorphous more prone to OV than crystalline. Strain both compressive and tensile can aid in ov formation, but compressive strain may increase Ev needed. However may make collapse more probable if oxygen vacancies do form. Also a high dielectric constant may aid in piezoelectric squeezing of the iron oxide when charged. Inducing oxygen vacancies takes around 0.2-2 eV. I am guessing to get collapse of the structure and fusion via muon oxygen vacancy intermediates is up to a couple hundred times higher(since a muon is 207x an electron [[https://www.energy.gov/science/doe-explainsmuons|#]] ) say 50-500 eV. when low valence ions like M3+or M2+exist in MO2, VOs are created to maintain the electrostatic balance, which means Fe3+ doping SiO2 would induce oxygen vacancies. More oxygen vacancies are generated at low temps like 300c. EPR measures unpaired electrons and electrons are trapped at oxygen vacancies. Au nanoparticles induced oxygen vacancies in TiO2, which could mean producing some gold causes a cascade to produce more. Cu doping of TiO2 caused near identical oxygen vacancy induction, like for 6%25 copper doped, there was 8%25 oxygen vacancies. Oxygen vacancies disappear when heated to 400k in oxygen. Carbon monoxide CO is very good at creating oxygen vacancies because it scrubs oxygen, which is created combusting hydrocarbons or charcoal in low oxygen environments. Oxygen vacancies can accept electrons from light irradiation from the valence band VB and bring them to the conduction band CB. Ov's promote charge transfer. OVs act as positive charge centers to attract electrons, perhaps if it gets 207 electrons then it becomes a muon and can catalyze a structural collapse into fusion. Page 2101 currently.%0aExcessive ov's may trap electrons and restrain electron mobility which is bad for solar cells but for fusion might be good. We need 3 irons and 2 oxygens and in tio4 iron doped it would be 1 iron for every 4 oxygens so we can afford to loose lots of oxygens to vacancies. Goodness, actually sulfur is 32 amu so that means it is possible that instead of oxygen it could be 3 irons and 1 sulfur. Oxygen vacancies cause defect assisted electron transport. Ovs increase affinity for ions and molecules. Ovs as electron capture sites can modify coordination structure and electronic states of adsorbed reactant, therefore activating them, which could mean conversion of H2S to HS radical. Yes it is shown ovs can convert adsorbed O2 to O2 radical by trapping and transporting plasmonic hot electrons. Oxygen vacancies create oxygen radicals more effectively than hydroxyls create radicals (but hydroxyls induce ovs so are probably good to have). Ovs activate reactants by weakening their bond or changing their bond angle. Picture on page 2103 figure 14e shows that with excess ovs some of the manganese atoms are squished tiny, which could be what we need to create fusion. Page 2104 shows that when a molecule like co2 goes to ov the electrons around the ov are injected into it creating CO radical. The same can happen with h2s to HS radical, which would then collapse with 3 iron 55's (from the tellurium neutrons) to produce gold. Hydrogen peroxide from oxygen reduction can also be facilitated by oxygen vacancies. Page 2108 anion and cation defects synergize to change the charge density and catalyze reactions better and even be better at energy storage perhaps [[capacitor]]. Excessive ov's trap electrons liberated from valence band and prevent them from entering the conduction band, this new band is called an impurity band. This decreases electronic conductivity (a good thing to cause structural collapse and fusion?). Surface ov help catalysis but bulk (deep in lattice) ov act as charge capture center and inhibit electron-hole separation (a good thing for fusion?). Synergy may exist between OVs and cation (like Fe) doping for catalysis. This ion doping can stabilize oxygen vacancies as well.%0a%0aQuartz has low dielectric constant and piezoelectric coefficient of 4.5 and 2 respectively [[https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/piezoelectric-voltage-coefficient|#]] whereas barium titanate has piezoelectric coefficient of 200 and calcium copper titanate of 150 [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_piezoelectric_materials|#]] which means these new dielectrics can crush the iron oxide lattice much better.

Arsenic rich pyrite contains gold [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlin–type_gold_deposit|#]] so perhaps the arsenic helps create sulfur vacancies like chloride creates oxygen vacancies. Likely yes, arsenic combines with sulfur to produce realgar which means the arsenic can bind the sulfur and pull it from the structure. However since sulfur is needed to make gold, there couldn't be large areas of gold produced since the vacancies would inhibit gold production from continuing since the missing sulfurs were actually needed to make gold. So the arsenic destabilizes the structure allowing fusion, but it also removes a necessary ingredient which prevents the reaction from continuing after the first collapse. This is why carlin type deposits produce microscopic gold%0a%0a!!!Halogens%0a%0aChloride helps induce hydroxyl radicals and thus oxygen vacancies, from the chloride from iron chloride or add dead sea salt since it has bromide too which helps.%0a!!!Chelated iron%0a%0asalicylic acid around $10-20 per lb [[https://www.ebay.com/itm/115024297221|#]] [[https://www.ebay.com/itm/321284297280|#]] [[https://www.ebay.com/itm/175377180725|#]] 55 lb for $361 [[https://www.ebay.com/itm/255565288043|#]]%0a%0a!!!Recipe attempt%0asee also [[GiveCoin#gold]] and [[#process| Gold production process]]%0a\\3Fe'_55_' + S'_16_' + 15e'^-^' => Au'_197_'%0a#Create Calcium Copper Titanate (CCT)%0a##4TiO2 + CaCO3 + 3CuO (yields CaCu3Ti4O12 {aka CaCuTi} + CO2 when fired) press to 20,000+ psi (heated and vacuum if possible) for 1 hour, remove and and sinter at 1000-1200c (probably 1050c)%0a#Create Iron(III)Salicylate (Fe3Sa)%0a##Mix 3 moles (61g) Salicylic acid (138.122 mw) with 1 mole (39g) Iron(III)Chloride (162.204 mw anhydrous), should be purple solution, heat to dry and grind into yellow powder.%0a#Mix 1 part Fe3Sa with 2 parts CCT (1/3 part dead sea salt optional, only use if you purified out the chloride from the Fe3Sa), moisten powder with a small amount of 20%25+ acetic acid, press to 20,000 psi heated to 200c under vacuum for 1 hour, then remove pellet from press and heat it to 1050c (burn in a fire) for 24 hours if possible.%0a#Grind Fe3Sa-CCT (FeCCT) ceramic into powder%0a#Mix 2 parts FeCCT with 2/3 part [[Bone oil]], and 1/3 part [[#phosphorus|ZDDP]], and 1 part Sulfur and 1/7 part Tellurium, press to 20,000 psi heated to *UP TO* (start lower to prevent explosion) 200c under vacuum (after the gas leaves the die it should bubble through sodium or potassium hydroxide solution to remove H'_2_'S before making it to the vacuum pump).

Then to charge the electrodes use a microwave transformer to produce low radio wave frequency.  This probably explains gold in quartz veins, hydrogen sulfide/telluride/selenide is the ionizable gas, the quartz is the dielectric, the connection with the deep crust/mantle is the wire inside the dielectric tube, and the ground outside the quartz vein is the grounding electrode, and the iron oxide (rust) on the quartz gets hit with the ion plasma.%0a%0aMy current theory of [[Lost Dutchman]] is he found a stash of [[jesuit]] gold [[https://youtu.be/RND-C83mliU|#]] and I think since the ore he was found with in a shoe box under his bed which matched no known earth ore when he died, the jesuits made the gold using perhaps a magnifying glass concentrating light to make gold from iron oxide and sand and sulfur.%0a%0a!!Naturehacker videos%0a%0aHow to make Gold with rust and crystals (Not a joke DANGER: RADIATION EMMITED)%0a%0ahttps://youtu.be/lDMX5-6HZ2A%0a%0aSmoking Gun for Gold creation?

and I have here with me an attacker who has made some really%0a0:14%0ainteresting claims about how to make gold from iron oxide since this kind of falls into my area of%0a0:20%0aexpertise I'm going to show him why it's wrong and without further ado hello%0a0:26%0anature hacker hello so um I think the best idea to do this is to give you some%0a0:33%0aminutes like 10 minutes or so to present your case is that Alright for you yeah sounds good okay%0a0:40%0aso then just begin tell me when you're finished all right so this all started%0a0:47%0aum maybe a month ago when I was watching something on TV about um them finding%0a0:53%0agold in sewage so I was thinking huh this is interesting you know I don't really%0a0:59%0athink that many people eat gold and you know plants aren't big gold%0a1:04%0aconcentrators necessary that we eat so saying well how does this happen and could it be possible that the gold is%0a1:11%0aactually produced you know in our bodies or into it or something like that and%0a1:18%0athen just got me thinking about maybe it's actually possible to make gold so I%0a1:23%0astarted doing a lot of research and so I kind of forgot about that you know per%0a1:28%0ase I just started doing research on how gold is found in the earth you know is gold made in the earth how is gold made%0a1:35%0ayou know what the current theories are and everything and so I kind of forgot about the gold and - interesting for the%0a1:40%0amoment and I started finding that gold is found in very specific conditions um%0a1:47%0ayou know it's basically always found with quartz it's basically always found%0a1:54%0awith iron um you know it's basically always found with either sulfur or%0a1:59%0atellurium or so selenium I believe those types of elements that they're all in%0a2:06%0athe same uh they're all in the same column of the periodic table um and you%0a2:12%0aknow it just got me thinking that one Wow this this is a very specific set of circumstances where gold%0a2:18%0ais found um maybe gold is actually made with some of%0a2:24%0athese as ingredients you know we've definitely heard of alchemy and things like that and that's typically thought%0a2:29%0ato be mercury because mercury is very close to gold on the periodic table so we're like okay well if we can remove a%0a2:35%0aproton I believe we can convert mercury in the gold so that's typically the top but um but you know I'm seeing these%0a2:43%0athese elements like quartz or you know compounds like cords or an iron and and%0a2:52%0ayou know sulfur and things like that found together with gold all the time something well maybe maybe these are the%0a2:59%0athings that gold could be made out of so um you know and looking at the theories you know a lot like the new theory is%0a3:06%0anow that gold can only be made when neutron stars which are very rare thing%0a3:11%0aneutron stars collide that's where all the gold comes from and that just seems very very unlikely to me that all the%0a3:18%0agold in the universe is from neutron stars colliding and you know obviously we have a lot of heavy elements so you%0a3:25%0aknow is neutron stars colliding the only way these heavy elements are created I don't think so so um you know doing all%0a3:34%0athat research and um and then finding it's been coming up with an idea of okay%0a3:39%0amaybe gold is created from I don't know how I came up with this idea but the%0a3:45%0aidea was that electricity could create it and that these very strong so hydro%0a3:52%0ah2s hydrogen sulfide and h2 te hydrogen%0a3:58%0aTelluride arm come up in earthquakes and we also know that gold is really found%0a4:04%0aaround earthquake zones you know like California has really rich gold positive if there's a lot of earthquakes there it's just a common%0a4:11%0afact that you know gold is found in earthquake areas so one other thing%0a4:16%0athat's found a lot in earth cake boy areas is hydrogen sulfide gas you know we sometimes even hydrogen telluride gas%0a4:22%0aum and that you know obviously these are the things that create sulphide minerals tell Euler%0a4:30%0atelluride minerals um so the thought is that okay let's say that there's some%0a4:36%0airon oxide trapped in quartz which is very common to happen um then this in an%0a4:43%0aearthquake hydrogen sulfide gas would rush by this gas is a strong reducing%0a4:48%0aagent which is like an electron donor and also especially when it reacts with%0a4:54%0asodium you know in the form of like sodium hydroxide or sodium oxide or%0a4:59%0asomething like that um it will create HS or SH which is a%0a5:05%0avery very strong reducing agent so I'm like well if we have a lot of this gas rushing by this quartz and the quartz%0a5:11%0acould have a lot of sodium in it especially in California the course has a lot of sodium in it we can create a%0a5:17%0avery strong electric charge in the quartz which would transfer to the%0a5:23%0ahematite the iron oxide inside the quartz and hopefully convert it into gold so that was the thought and then um%0a5:31%0aso the thought is basically that the self eyes or Telluride is acting as a reducing agent to convert iron into gold%0a5:40%0anow the question was well how exactly would that happen arm how exactly would%0a5:46%0athe gold you know turning into or to start the iron turn into gold and why would it have to be an oxide of iron%0a5:52%0abecause because we see a lot of a lot of gold miners will say the redder the better the redder the better which means%0a5:59%0athat the more hematite in the quartz the better you know the better it is as an%0a6:05%0aorder for gold so you know the thought would be that hematite is needed in order for this process to create gold%0a6:12%0aand so one of the mechanisms I came up with that could explain it would be oxygen vacancies in the iron oxide%0a6:19%0astructure so um when you have a strongly positive charge um you create austen%0a6:28%0avacancies and then these vacancies will migrate to a strong negative charge and%0a6:34%0athen when they're there I'm guessing that electrons can fill the vacancies%0a6:40%0aand I'm guessing that what this can do is create a collapse of the structure of iron oxide and it turns out I did the%0a6:48%0amath that iron 55 which is I guess you can say a rare isotope of iron but it's%0a6:55%0asomething that's created by the very common when very common isotopes of iron%0a7:01%0alike 54 and 56 are hit with neutron radiation they turn in 55 very strangely%0a7:07%0airon 56 go to 57 then decays the 55 iron%0a7:13%0a54 games to iron 55 so radiation which is also radiation is also found in%0a7:19%0aearthquakes a lot so radiation can cause iron to turn in iron 55 and if you take%0a7:25%0athree iron 55 which is the structure of iron oxide you know to a good degree the%0a7:31%0astructure of iron oxide you take three of those and two oxygens the theory is that that vacancy will cause an%0a7:39%0aimplosion and those three atoms will combine into gold and they add up to%0a7:45%0acreate the molecular weight of gold now once you know at some point I was I thought back to the original idea of the%0a7:52%0ayou know gold in sewage and I realized that there's a lot of hydrogen sulfide in sewage something maybe maybe the gold%0a8:00%0ais actually being made in sewage and it's from the hydrogen sulfide producing microbes that are actually doing so%0a8:08%0aanyway that that's pretty much my thought process on it so yeah okay so my%0a8:14%0asuggestion is Oh first of all I can get my echo can you maybe turn your speaker's little more silent yeah yeah%0a8:21%0aturn you down yeah all right so I could%0a8:28%0akill myself what's annoying okay hold on one second let me assure you as well%0a8:53%0ame there yeah yeah no better okay so my suggestion is that we go through the%0a9:01%0alist of the claims that you've made and discuss every single one of them if we mind the time for everyone everything so%0a9:09%0aand just started with the point that gold is found in sewage and therefore it should somehow be produced in sewage%0a9:16%0athat is a non sequitur just because the gold is there doesn't mean that is that it is produced where for example yeah%0a9:23%0agold goes for example could end up in switch for example with electronic trash%0a9:29%0abecause gold is widely used in electronic materials computers smartphones monitors your name at%0a9:35%0awhatever when they would be going for dumps not necessarily see with you%0a9:40%0ayou know dumpsters were like trying to garbage would be yeah mainly but first%0a9:46%0aof all I don't know the amount of gold that you're claiming is fallen sewage so if it's only trace material then well%0a9:52%0awhat they find is it's a low-level gold mine is what they call it like the amount of gold in sewages would be%0a9:58%0aconsidered a gold mine alleged doing all the concentrations approximately you can%0a10:05%0agoogle it just Google like gold and sewage there's been a lot of articles on stuff okay%0a10:11%0aso again I said I don't think that just%0a10:18%0abecause the gold is found in there that that doesn't mean that it's produced there so I mean you actually I Joe Lopez%0a10:24%0awas generally thinking all right so then then we just skip that or do you want to elaborate more on that point um yeah I%0a10:33%0amean that was basically just what got me thinking about it it didn't quite make sense to me that there would necessarily%0a10:39%0abe like old sewage that's why I thought that would that's one one dot you know%0a10:44%0ato connect I would think but not necessarily proof in and of itself obviously all right%0a10:49%0aand then so you saw your main claim is that there's a reaction that you can perform which involves%0a10:55%0athe hydrogen sulfide the quartz crystal plus the iron oxide and the main problem%0a11:02%0athat I have with it is that what this comes down to is that the chemical%0a11:09%0aenvironment of the iron atoms and the oxygen atoms somehow influences the%0a11:16%0areactions of the nuclei themselves and right but the problem is that if that%0a11:23%0awere the case if the chemical environment of substances would influence the reactions of the nuclei%0a11:31%0athen we would already be able to use this properties to get rid of a nuclear%0a11:39%0awaste for example God would be able to manipulate the nuclear base in a%0a11:44%0achemical way and increase or decrease the amount of radiation emitted by it%0a11:51%0aand that has never been observed so that's actually quite a bold claim to%0a11:56%0amake and which you actually have to really provide some hard evidence for and I don't see a yet well the mechanism%0a12:04%0aarm the summer established mechanism of%0a12:10%0akind of chemically induced nuclear reactions would be the creation of neutrons from protons and electrons yeah%0a12:18%0abut you can't do that chemically that's not a chemical reaction but chemists reduce that is only the electrons around%0a12:24%0athe nuclei and for for a chemist the nucleus itself is completely irrelevant it could be a single particle with a%0a12:30%0adefiant charge that's not that's not a chemical reaction that's nuclear physical reaction but that was just a%0a12:37%0aterminology thing whatever you would want to call it I mean you know India is that's that's not only me that's the%0a12:44%0ascientific consensus calling it so the edges are cut okay well there is you%0a12:51%0aknow field called nuclear chemistry yeah by Newton yeah nuclear chemistry deals with the chemistry of radioactive%0a12:57%0amaterials for example how to separate different fission reactions in reactors%0a13:03%0aor how to separate so the whole field of chemistry is just separation of%0a13:08%0amaterials no that's the difference brain nuclear chemistry tomato is react reactions%0a13:15%0acould involve an electron and a proton there'll be a reaction know what%0a13:21%0achemistry deals with is how the electrons behaves yeah how the electrons%0a13:28%0athemself pays when the nuclei of the of the atoms are completely relevant for chemistry whenever you have a direct%0a13:34%0areaction such as for example the problem you know the reaction to start medalist determines how many electrons you can%0a13:40%0ahave which is not sure but they don't they don't react directly everything%0a13:47%0athat happens there is a detraction electric electric macam electrostatic%0a13:53%0aattraction between the two particles but there's no direct reaction between the for example nuclear reactions other ones%0a14:01%0athat the nuclei react themselves the chemistry there are no nuclei that react the nuclei don't do anything there can%0a14:08%0abe seen a standard conventional chemistry sure but I mean if you want to define chemistry is that which with that%0a14:14%0awhich is not nucular than fine it's it's physics then but I mean yeah I don't really let that that's%0a14:21%0amy point because in India videos you're mixed up nuclear chemistry and nuclear reactions%0a14:27%0athat's a different thing well you know the thought is um cold%0a14:32%0afusion you know I don't necessarily want to open up a whole bag can of worms a cold fusion but cold fusion would be%0a14:38%0alike chemical nuclear reactions whereas hot fusion would be like ah you know%0a14:44%0aphysics high temperature physics but you know I I don't know if it how much it matters what the terminology we use but%0a14:50%0ait ends up as physics anyways um regarding cold fusion what basically%0a14:56%0ahappens is that at least that was a claim that the chemical environment of I think it was metal hydrides that would%0a15:02%0ainfluence how words would induce student reactions the point is that this%0a15:07%0ais show has been shown to be not working so well is that still under debate I%0a15:13%0amean there's definitely a lot of scientists there's been one whistleblower from MIT who said that their claim that they disproved it was%0a15:20%0aactually false that you know they actually did have some evidences supported that was covered up so there's%0a15:27%0aan ongoing discussion well there was a I think it all started in the ninth at%0a15:32%0aIndian late 80s and 90s when the last paper published claiming that cold%0a15:38%0afusion would work which was later shown by other work groups that's as original experiment wasn't%0a15:45%0arepeatable and the article was eventually retracted so that it's very weird agreement of getting it also%0a15:52%0ahappen there definitely have groups that have had a positive you know I have a%0a15:57%0apositive supporting evidence and you can look that up online there's there's been a 60 Minutes interview with people with%0a16:05%0alike real scientists who were shown the evidence of you know an Israeli company who's claiming difficult fusion and they%0a16:11%0aworried about it actually publish it there's no submitting that they can do interviews as long as they want when%0a16:17%0athey don't publish it and it's practically useless whatever they say it's useless unless it's published%0a16:23%0athere's a lot of published data of cold fusion on your show on Ixtapa it can%0a16:29%0aappear with scientific drama sure yeah I have examples I don't know if you how you want me to show here and we have the%0a16:37%0alink to the to the article um yeah I mean I could find something here let's%0a16:44%0asee I think the claim would be I by the%0a16:51%0awriter had put your claim conspiracies of the conspiracy going on to come up cold fusion%0a16:56%0abecause that's the impression I'm getting I could definitely see that could definitely be a possibility the%0a17:02%0areason the motive would be because the people performing hot fusion are getting%0a17:08%0abillions of dollars in funding from the government and if there's a cold easier%0a17:13%0away to do it then that revenue would be in jeopardy so I could definitely see that some institutions or professors%0a17:20%0awould want to stop research into cold fusion which they effectively did yeah but but the question is the funding%0a17:27%0adoesn't and to do it so the most part in the pockets of the scientists were%0a17:33%0acommitted ends in the equipment I I don't smell a Lurie is it yeah we%0a17:39%0ajoin another ant but the most part directly goes into the materials needed look Sonia reacted itself for example%0a17:47%0awhen when talking about the Austral the ITER in southern France that thing%0a17:55%0aliterally costs billions that the magnetic coils alone cost billions great%0a18:01%0aright those are the celery stem cells are rather small small part of the money that is needed right and you know I've%0a18:07%0aworked in science and a big part of getting grants and stuff is to to%0a18:13%0abasically you have to prove to the agency that this is the only way that you can do the research like I worked in%0a18:19%0aanimal research and we use rats and we had to prove that we couldn't do that%0a18:24%0aresearch in a lower organism so you know if cold fusion is a possibility of%0a18:30%0apotential potentiality then it would be much more difficult for them to justify the need for such expensive equipment%0a18:37%0awhen something cheaper and easier to be done so I could see how it could be a conspiracy to cover it up yeah yeah all%0a18:44%0aright I just wanted to have to clear it up first okay so could you please describe the%0a18:52%0aexperiment that you're planning to do on the mechanics what kind of reactor you're going to use what sort of it%0a19:01%0afirst of all how I go you're going to show that the results that maybe you%0a19:07%0athink you'll get gold as a result how do you prove it ma'am right what amount of%0a19:13%0astarting material to use etc well um ie%0a19:18%0ais what I would like to do is you know obviously have an experiment send a%0a19:25%0asample of pre experiment to get analyzed for gold send an experiment post you%0a19:30%0aknow a sample post experiment to get analyzed see if there's any extra gold in it um it just turns out difficult to%0a19:36%0ado that what I've been trying to do lately is actually extract the gold on my own but you know it's obviously%0a19:42%0apretty crude just do an acid extraction and a precipitation with smv or oxalic acid I haven't gotten any%0a19:49%0aold and I mean if there's very small mountains unlike that would get recover any yeah i think i think the best the%0a19:56%0abest way you can actually test for goal in this case even for small amounts to use a mass spectrometer right but that%0a20:02%0awill directly show you the goals even the different isotopes if you don't get it%0a20:08%0ayeah right so yeah right quite easy way to do it once I feel like I have an%0a20:14%0aexperiment as a lot of potential then I will definitely try to submit something%0a20:19%0afrom mass spectrometry but what I'm trying to do right now I got this little radiation detector it's gamma and%0a20:26%0aNeutron it's a radiation so I'm trying%0a20:33%0ato see if like any of my experiments I can get any noticeable radiation coming%0a20:38%0aoff of it if I notice a lot of radiation then that would be promising for me that maybe something's working and then I%0a20:45%0awould you know benefit from getting it analyzed so you know my present%0a20:51%0aexperiments have just been doing electrolysis kind of like the you know somewhat similar to the cold fusion%0a20:57%0amethod then what tessick electrolysis to do with the other experiment that they proposed what's the connection%0a21:04%0aum well okay yeah I should I explain the other experiment but the thought is that%0a21:09%0aelecti no electricity can create gold from iron oxide so if we take the two%0a21:16%0airon electrodes one it's a positive or it's got a lot of rust accumulating iron%0a21:21%0aoxide accumulating then switch to polarity and then get that electrode to%0a21:27%0abe negative where electrons are going to interact with that rust that maybe we could get some gold I thought I was%0a21:34%0agetting radiation coming off of it but with this meter I'm not getting in radiation so I don't think it's very promising experiment I mean what what%0a21:41%0ayou're proposing is practically an electrochemical cell so that when you%0a21:46%0ahave iron oxides electrode and you will apply a negative potential you would%0a21:53%0asimply end up with iron in the best case but this is a very own processing and%0a21:59%0aworking nonsense I think the eighteen hundreds with the first batteries made by Volta right so yeah yeah wanted%0a22:08%0adesperately he's doing this kind of stuff that has never been shown anything that would indicate that there would be%0a22:14%0agold forming because you can really look at the electrochemical potential of iron to oxide and iron three oxide right what%0a22:22%0athe standard hydrogen electrode and there's no mentioning of anything ever these are unknown processes and you%0a22:27%0aclaim that there's something wrong with them or there's something that no I mean I'll come back already how about them I'm not saying this would%0a22:34%0abe the major reaction I you know I know chemistry to definitely that would be the major reaction is just reduction of%0a22:41%0airon oxide but there are things called oxygen vacancies that can form in these structures so it is possible that we%0a22:48%0acould get oxygen vacancies and then fill that vacancy with an electron it would be very small part of the reaction are%0a22:55%0ayou claiming that you can incite the iron oxide crust you can fill vacancies were usually ions would be with%0a23:01%0aelectrons there's the possibility that do you have any evidence for that%0a23:07%0abecause as far as I'm at I'm aware that this has never been shown to be the case%0a23:13%0aexcept for metal maybe metal hydrides because they tend to be higher at the head a little bit Lee mm-hmm transition%0a23:21%0ametal hydrides 10 tend to do something similar okay you know I I can't think of%0a23:27%0aspecific but I mean you know this is all stuff that I researched finding support in the research so I believe that it is%0a23:32%0apossible for electrons to linky I think I read that somewhere but everywhere I don't know about so how much get if you%0a23:39%0atreated in many of published signs or maybe yeah yeah exactly I always I'm always reading in published%0a23:47%0ascience but yeah I might marry my up you know I'm trying to verifying I'm trying to verify my theory as I go so not a%0a23:52%0awriter act but yeah just out of curiosity have ready to let them learn%0a23:58%0achemistry what's wrong diversity from%0a24:03%0aUniversity all right so what kind of to the end reach where to go for biology or%0a24:09%0aor chemistry itself um well I don't really want to give specifics but you%0a24:14%0aknow I did take upto analytical chemistry so the only thing I didn't take I believe this%0a24:20%0aphysical gum okay so um let me go back%0a24:26%0ato my list of claims claims that you made Yeah right and you're claiming that%0a24:32%0athese reactions produce angles are happening practically right now are you%0a24:37%0aaren't you well that's the thought is it's not necessarily about me making%0a24:43%0agold as far as the claims and making claims of making is the Jeep theory I'm presenting a theory I know you're%0a24:50%0aprotecting a hypothesis no I'm not presenting hypothesis and the fastest%0a24:55%0athe experiment has not been done know about the theory is when if there is a%0a25:01%0athought construct that that explains the the difference relation that the science%0a25:08%0apractically but that has been already confirmed every claim that you've already made has has not that makes it a%0a25:14%0ahypothesis not a theory well that we've been talking about these things but in general what I'm presenting is that my%0a25:21%0atheory is that gold is made in this certain way okay and I can talk more%0a25:26%0aabout that the geology of it but in the African my question I mean when you say%0a25:31%0athat as you said that gold is deposited%0a25:37%0ain for example earthquake area does that aren't you claiming that this process of%0a25:43%0athe gold formation is happening right now well I has it happened some time ago and it has stopped for some reason I would%0a25:50%0athink that yes it is happening right now and all right you know this yeah%0a25:55%0abasically so yep Joe you're Frost well%0a26:01%0abasically what I would I feel like I'm trying to present at least in my first video and things is that I'm creating a%0a26:07%0atheory of how gold is made based on the geology so I feel like my theory explains the geology at least as good if%0a26:15%0anot better than the current theory of how gold is formed in the earth based on%0a26:22%0athe geology of how it's found so yeah it's based on the geology and then I'm trying to dig deeper and get to%0a26:29%0athe chemistry or physics at how it's actually happening alright so um you%0a26:34%0aclaimed that iron 55 would be needed for the reaction right right right if that%0a26:41%0awere the case wouldn't you then expect iron 55 to be at least in found traces%0a26:49%0aat relatively fresh coal deposits because iron 55 has a half-life of about%0a26:54%0atwo years that makes it really rare even%0a27:00%0aif there would be some sort of neutron radiation coming in which I don't think is the case there is you have to have%0a27:07%0aevidence of iron 55 occurring in nature in the in the proximity of coal deposits%0a27:12%0aI don't have any other direct evidence that I don't know whether or not I would%0a27:17%0apredict them maybe one evidence for example be the abundance of the decay%0a27:24%0aproduct of iron 55-foot which i think is manganese 55 inside iron crisper iron%0a27:32%0aoxide crystals that are found close to gold deposits sure yeah yeah this is the%0a27:41%0aproblem with manganese 55 is that it's the only stable isotope of manganese so whenever you have manganese you will%0a27:47%0ahave manganese 55 so you really can't do any isotopic analysis or not booking it%0a27:52%0amaybe if there's a relative extra abundance of 55 and relation the other%0a27:57%0aisotopes that could be annoying so too long hot all right the problem is trivia%0a28:03%0aum well I mean I've been able to make a bunch of predictions and verify them in%0a28:08%0athe science like for example if this is the case we would see a lot of mercury%0a28:13%0abeing created in the same process because if iron 56 I believe is used%0a28:20%0ainstead of 55 we would end up with mercury and it does turn out that mercury is one of the biggest%0a28:25%0acontaminants in gold and that you know yes that is not that is not surprising I%0a28:31%0amean first of all mercury in its elemental form is a liquid so other methods such as the precious metals gold%0a28:37%0airidium platinum so on and so forth what tends to solve in mercury and then as%0a28:42%0aactually vapor pressures even quite high at room temperature you would slowly get%0a28:48%0arid of the mercury so the position of that stuff is not unexpected at least in my opinion right right but just that%0a28:56%0aplus all these other factors it's it does seem hard to explain that that gold%0a29:02%0awould just be randomly found with quartz and iron and not really err I mean class%0a29:08%0ais nothing but silicon dioxide it's more or less the most abundant substance on the surface of the planet%0a29:15%0aokay well maybe your question oxygen is the most abundant element in the Earth's%0a29:22%0acrust and I think silicon is either the second or the third one so they're a so that the probability that even that you%0a29:30%0afind silicon dioxide also known as quartz in the proximity of co2 posit is high anyways and I don't see any any%0a29:36%0apoint how you can differentiate between a random occurrence and the two things%0a29:42%0abeing being connected well it is well-known though that like quartz%0a29:47%0adeposits are definitely places to look for gold especially in conjunction with iron I mean you know it's not you%0a29:55%0awouldn't look for uh you know manganese in those conditions necessarily but if%0a30:01%0athat is I mean it is well known and it's there's been a lot of theories as to why that is%0a30:06%0ayou know people saying that gold is found in the vapor phase of magma and that the grape of phase yeah I don't%0a30:15%0areally do mean I'm ripe efface I mean it's a liquid listen - vapor phase well%0a30:21%0ayeah I mean this is their theory this is the the mainstream theory of how gold is%0a30:26%0adeposited where it is you know I think you're mixing something up there because I've never actually had to turn vapor%0a30:32%0aphase in okay so um magma yeah well I mean just above the magma in the vapor I%0a30:39%0aguess but there's that how it gets up into the nooks and crannies of the crystals with the iron is the quartz and%0a30:46%0athe iron and things like that but all right so um an important question that I would%0a30:53%0areally like to have an answer for us where do you think the energy comes from because you know that iron has the most%0a30:59%0adata nucleus at all meaning that every nuclear reaction yielding atoms with%0a31:07%0ahigh atomic numbers than 26 which is iron actually are endothermic so in the%0a31:14%0areaction causing where the energy come from right well the energy would come from a%0a31:19%0ahigh voltage tracking the very high voltage they give you high voltage but in the original experiment that you%0a31:25%0aproposed everything you did was what chemical right right go do this car that%0a31:31%0aexperiment at all or do you have done quietly why I do at the energy must come%0a31:38%0afrom electricity because it is doing what you expected to yield gold you%0a31:43%0awould have to have the energy coming from a chemical process and remake the%0a31:49%0aprocess is simply too weak to do that well necessarily I mean PV electricity%0a31:56%0acan yield very high voltages and that's known to be in court so that you have%0a32:01%0agot is that all that you can energy are two different things voltage usually do you know how much do%0a32:08%0ayou know how much energy it approximately needs for a nuke in%0a32:14%0anuclear reaction of that type because you can simply look at that you can%0a32:19%0asimply look up the binding energies of different nuclei in the table but that%0a32:26%0ais widely known and that's good I will definitely provide of everything and you%0a32:32%0awill end up with a few mega electron volts maybe more per nuclei if a%0a32:39%0aparticle per Neutron or proton x-ray that's I think about ten or twenty%0a32:46%0athousand times more than it's needed for a chemical process right the chemical process simply can't do that well I mean%0a32:54%0adepends on how you define a chemical process I mean this is the this is my theory of how the the voltage gets%0a33:01%0acreated and st the rushing by of the hydrogen sulfide gas basically charging up a quartz%0a33:09%0acrystal yeah I understand your hypothesis but the problem is that the energy simply doesn't add up you can't%0a33:15%0ado it at all you could get next develop it as you%0a33:20%0aclaimed it to be sparking metalic stoichiometrically correct that would be%0a33:27%0aeven God well I mean a crystal can build up charge we know that is like in its PV%0a33:34%0aelectricity so if there's a large volume of reduced strong reducing agent like%0a33:39%0ahydrogen sulfide rushing by the crystal in theory it could charge crystal maybe to tens of%0a33:46%0athousands of volts I think is definitely conservative maybe a million I'm sure if are you sure that silicon%0a33:56%0adioxide crystals behave like kids or electrical components I'm not sure if%0a34:01%0athat's okay yeah well corollaries look it up yeah TV electricity that's a good way to look it%0a34:07%0aup and they yeah in PD electricity course crystals can generate very high voltages so it's I don't think it's%0a34:15%0abeyond the realm of possibility yeah I highly doubt the tech that's the case so%0a34:21%0aI'm basically in your reaction how you do you so what what you're doing is%0a34:28%0abasically but what I think what will happen in your reaction is basically a redox process you will oxidize the%0a34:34%0ahydrogen sulfide other HS minus ions 2h m dot H s 2 2 minus ions and you will%0a34:43%0areduce the iron 3 in your iron 3 oxide to iron 2 and therefore form FES 2 also%0a34:52%0aknown the spy-rays fourth cone and how would you stop that from happening%0a34:58%0awell I I don't well how does that work from happening would be to segregate it%0a35:03%0aso basically the quartz crystal is the iron oxide it inside the quartz crystal%0a35:09%0aso it's not able to get self you know sulfide it all right so you're going to%0a35:14%0aseparate the two processes locally now but by having great stop is%0a35:23%0ato compare that to a battery because what you do in a battery is you also have two different chemical processes%0a35:29%0athat are separated locally and the charges that happen in the reaction reduction part of the reaction are%0a35:37%0atransferred to the cable to the other to not not read on the side where the%0a35:45%0amaterial oxidized you get the electrons and they will be transmitted through a cable or a wire to the side where the%0a35:50%0aother material is reduced so the problem is batteries only work if you have a%0a35:58%0athing called an iron bridge right over well that yes all right then where is%0a36:05%0athe equivalent of the iron bridge in your experiment well what this would be%0a36:11%0ayou know it's not an it it's not exactly bare it'd be more like a capacitor I would think I know because what what%0a36:18%0ayou're claiming is that all the time negative charges will be transmitted from one side to another won't be a%0a36:25%0acapacitor if you if you claim that this this direction can be done all the time%0a36:32%0aso in a continuous process right well the way I see it is let's say we have%0a36:37%0atwo quartz crystals and some iron oxide between it and we're charging up one%0a36:43%0aside of the quartz crystal that that negative charge will create a positive%0a36:50%0acharge and the other side of quartz crystal which is attaching to the dielectric which is the iron oxide and%0a36:56%0athen the other side of the quartz crystal let's attach the other side of the iron oxide would develop a negative%0a37:02%0acharge so we kind of get something like that it's more of a capacitor I would%0a37:07%0athink in a battery I think you might be mixing up Crysta the polarization of crystals with a choke PS electricity%0a37:14%0adunno how a creates electricity is defined um but I don't know we mean by%0a37:20%0ahow it is defined yeah how it gets electricity defined when you are talking about voltage%0a37:25%0aacross C crystal not entirely that's one component missing%0a37:31%0awhat is that pressure well right for sure yeah yeah but do have any pressure%0a37:38%0aacting on your crystal you know experimental but don't do it it's not exactly a piezoelectric thing but what%0a37:45%0aI'm trying to say with the PD electric is that it is possible for a crystal to develop a charge differential from one%0a37:51%0aside to the other so that's what I'm going for with the PD electricity that course can operate in a way where%0a37:57%0adevelops a strong charge across the crystal yeah but you wouldn't you need a%0a38:03%0aconstant current through the crystal because once as you claim the electrons on the one side what react with the%0a38:10%0anuclei of the iron and the oxygen that means that you would have to refuel it in quote marks around the other side%0a38:19%0awith with the with hydrogen sulfide so it would need a large conductivity%0a38:26%0ainside the crystals which you won't have I actually had this argument better not another guy was acting that silicon%0a38:33%0adioxide would be conductive and I said no it's it isn't it's not going to array but that's the weird part about it is it%0a38:40%0ait can develop a charge across it so something's happening it's not a direct metallic type conductivity but there is%0a38:48%0aionic movement I think it's like and one's a logarithm the third eye on the%0a38:54%0aother than silicon dioxide because silicon dioxide is compared to other two%0a39:01%0aother kind of crystals it's the the bonds and inside the silicon dioxide I actual atomic bonds not not ionic forms%0a39:08%0aand that makes the part for any type of charge movement well I don't know%0a39:15%0aexactly but all I'm saying though is that PD the fact of PZ electricity in%0a39:20%0aquartz shows that somehow charge can there can be a differential in charge from one side across to the other I%0a39:27%0adon't know exactly chemically or physically how it happens but I know that you're a conductor for%0a39:33%0anon-contact is what right right okay can you explain it to me because I think you have made a misconception about it%0a39:40%0awell in a typical conductivity you have electrons that are loosely associated%0a39:46%0awith atoms a kind of you know can move back and forth yeah right do you know%0a39:52%0adriver little why they are able to move back and forth um I don't remember%0a39:59%0aexactly it's because in the the crystalline the metal there are different energy states in which the electrons can be and depending on%0a40:06%0awhether it's a conductor a nonconductor or semi conductor the energy difference between token so called valence band and%0a40:15%0athe conduction band is different in valence band then and products they actually overlapping are very close to%0a40:21%0aeach other and the more non conducting it gets the further apart they are and%0a40:26%0abasically the energy difference between those two is dependent on the chemical structure the structure of the different%0a40:32%0aatoms for example when you have graphene for example which has a connected sp2%0a40:39%0ahybridized system and you would have get you have will have the two energy levels quite close to each other and in things%0a40:48%0athey are there where there are no vacant orbitals for example s in silicon dioxide the band gap as it's called it's%0a40:55%0agoing to be very high so you won't have any conductivity and rate in silicon%0a41:01%0adioxide whatsoever well then explain to me how PV electricity happens Peter like%0a41:07%0aI mean I'm not saying you're wrong I'm just saying that that's not the complete picture of how charge can move that's one way%0a41:12%0aPPC electricity is when when you apply pressure to a crystal in a bright a%0a41:18%0aparticular crystal and then since that is the move closer to each other or%0a41:24%0afurther apart from each other the distance of the the distance of the%0a41:29%0aenergy levels is actually going to change and that yields the effect that%0a41:35%0aso first of all you need very specific crystals for that and the the pressure%0a41:45%0ayou will apply will do that right but it still shows that charge can move in a%0a41:52%0acrystal oh if they can develop a voltage which means a difference in the voltage%0a41:58%0awill be applied by head to head by pressing on it by applying pressure%0a42:03%0athat's actually the other way around so you don't you don't start with the electricity you start with the pressure%0a42:09%0athat is what you're advanced you can do both I mean just argue about PD%0a42:14%0aelectricity you can apply a voltage and it creates this strain in the material or you can create a strain in the%0a42:20%0amaterial and it creates a voltage you can go either way but to me that shows just that charge can move in a crystal%0a42:27%0aand you know silicon dioxide quartz crystal it can move it's not conduction%0a42:32%0aobviously but there is mechanisms for to move alright so um let me just quickly%0a42:40%0ago through my list yeah but what you%0a42:51%0asaid that it was that if the electrons could react with an iron nuclei you%0a42:56%0awould get some sort of implosion can you see explain that to me before%0a43:02%0aI'm having now I'm trying to first that the geology leads me to believe the gold%0a43:08%0ais created in a certain way maybe it actually is to use electricity with the earthquakes I don't know but I'm%0a43:14%0athinking it the hydrogen sulfide because it's always found ourselves like minerals but anyway so where are we%0a43:20%0agoing to talk about um implosion oh that's right so the thought is that%0a43:26%0awe're creating oxygen vacancies that this is the more chemical or physical%0a43:32%0aunderstanding of going deeper into the geology of how it's actually happening so I'm thinking maybe this is the case%0a43:38%0athis is not necessarily up yeah you're at this point kick in you're just left%0a43:43%0aright show me what elephant clothing you mean sure so basically the there's in%0a43:49%0athe structure there's you know two irons for every three oxygens so you have%0a43:54%0athese oxygen atoms and iron atoms in the structure of hematite or iron oxide so%0a43:59%0aan oxygen vacancy would be basically pulling out one of those oxygens from the structure so now it's like you%0a44:06%0ahave a building where a part of the building is pulled out so the in my mind%0a44:12%0athe potential is for an implosion in that part now however bad you're%0a44:18%0aactually think that removing an atom from a from a crystal would cost the other atoms to move closer to each other%0a44:23%0aand collide is that what you're saying possibly because there would be here's%0a44:30%0athe thing when you have oxygen in there that's basically a plus two charge I believe something like that so now it's%0a44:36%0aon this - - - - okay okay is like the vacancies plus - yeah so basically you%0a44:44%0ahave a minus charge that's being removed from the structure now the irons could%0a44:49%0awant to come together because there's that oxygen was basically repelling them%0a44:57%0aso that's my thought with it um you have a problem that I have with it is that%0a45:03%0ait's actually really hard to get atoms or to be more precise the nuclei close%0a45:10%0ato each other because of the Coulomb barrier that's why nuclear reactions only work in very extreme conditions%0a45:16%0abecause put simply the two positively charged nuclei rule will repel each%0a45:22%0aother the only effect that that costs them really to collide is the%0a45:28%0auncertainty principle the Heisenberg are you aware of that that probability%0a45:34%0arecognize it but I don't remember you don't remember it okay yet basic basically says that the hotter you get%0a45:40%0athe collision probability is going to be higher okay right and that is something%0a45:47%0areally wired by and cold fusion is really unlikely because the collision%0a45:52%0aprobability is more less infinitely small at room temperatures right but this is this could be a whole new%0a45:58%0amechanism and that that would be okay you have that vacancy do you have a mechanism for that can you propose one%0a46:05%0avacancy today though you don't know how to overcome the Coulomb barrier um that%0a46:14%0awould be with the Heisenberg effect yeah how do you do that low temperatures it would be a whole%0a46:20%0adifferent mechanism so you know I'm Megan regret because my question can you propose it the mechanism yes that's what%0a46:27%0aI'm saying is basically you create the oxygen vacancy somehow electrons fill%0a46:32%0athat vacancy and now you get those iron atoms collapsing in on each other you%0a46:38%0aget the negative charge from the electrode on the ions coming into that electron cloud but the collapsing iron%0a46:44%0airon sent them and sent us iron and iron nuclei would still have to overcome the%0a46:49%0aCoulomb barrier so that's not yeah I mean the columbaria is a physical thing%0a46:55%0ayou can measure it you can't you can't offer you anything he's ever given situation you have to overcome it by%0a47:02%0abasically yeah he's heating it up we're%0a47:08%0ahaving the in the nuclear and really the first of all very densely packed which%0a47:14%0ais by nuclear and nuclear reactions at least fusion reactions only happen and%0a47:19%0astarts because that's the on the point where the pressure the temperature high enough and as I said you also need high temperature because that's the only way%0a47:26%0athe the particles will be energy rich enough to overcome the Coulomb barrier%0a47:33%0aokay right but I mean it's it's a different mechanism like let me try to%0a47:38%0amake an example like right mechanism do you think that this reaction will be%0a47:46%0aindependent of the Coulomb barrier I have to look in the Coulomb barrier a%0a47:53%0alittle bit um but basically it's also called Coulomb wall maybe and you don't%0a47:59%0aknow it but ma'am okay yeah I definitely want to look into it more but what I'm%0a48:06%0asaying is that you don't necessarily need the high temperatures if you know if instead of relying on random%0a48:13%0ainteractions and molecules where you need the high temperature so that they will react with enough force or whatever%0a48:19%0aenergy you want to call it um instead of that situation we basically have a vise%0a48:24%0awhere we're cramming them together so it would be a different%0a48:29%0aparameters rather than heat needed like obviously the energy will still be needed but not necessarily in the form%0a48:36%0ayeah but that's that's more like modest my question how are you going to apply%0a48:42%0aenough energy for the two centers to fuse to one another well it would be in%0a48:47%0athe form of a very high voltage in the order of a million volt is where I'm going recently when you buy acceleration%0a48:53%0abecause of all voltages itself in that case more than acceleration not acceleration just as a potential let's%0a49:00%0asay you have an extremely high potential difference you have this extremely strong negative charge and those%0a49:05%0apositive iron ions are just going to want to collapse you know yeah others want to that means acceleration because%0a49:12%0athey at the end they will have to have modest the same location to react to one%0a49:18%0aanother right yes well you realize that%0a49:23%0athe acceleration far VD the energy of%0a49:28%0athe individual nuclei and the end you can convert that into the acceleration%0a49:34%0ainto the energy that I needed is not great and do you have any any mechanism%0a49:41%0ato show that that it's possible in such a system well I mean we can look at that%0a49:47%0aI don't remember what you called it something I wasn't aware of specifically and that is you know the bob thing with%0a49:54%0athe nuclei finding inter tunes and brightening area so that's something good to know maybe that can help us like%0a50:01%0asay okay we need three million volts for this to have the possibility of working yeah you're what three million volts you%0a50:08%0awould need so so much electron volts right okay almost our voltage in%0a50:13%0aelectron volts are a unit of energy okay okay we would have to do some conversion%0a50:20%0abut basically it would be in the form of a very high voltage so that would where%0a50:26%0athe energy would be where the energy comes from okay um yeah that's small as all the questions as I had for tonight%0a50:33%0ado you want to ask me anything or is that all right for you because we are%0a50:39%0aalmost at the one hour limit sounds about good all right then what I'm gonna do is first of all I think to%0a50:48%0ado maybe want to do this another time again when you have looked into binding energy and so forth sure we definitely%0a50:54%0ado that arm yeah I'm pretty busy lately but you know maybe I miss me as well as much yeah but%0a51:02%0anot like a plan so what I'm going to do now is I'll open the hangout for the other guys if they want to join I do you%0a51:09%0awant yeah or do you want to leave are probably going but alrighty so yeah%0a51:14%0athanks for coming on and see you then all right here take care all right so%0a51:27%0aI'm going to send you the link first of all some of my friends Mariah should%0a51:35%0aalready have it but whatever microblog health soil error and others it%0a51:58%0aOh microblog hello yeah%0a52:05%0ahow's my sound little just check on the stream and there's some sort of cracking%0a52:11%0anoise but I think it's alright yeah let me fix that okay%0a52:31%0ahow about now perfect good you%0a52:37%0ahello I'm Mariah so that was interesting um for someone who claims to have%0a52:45%0astudies chemistry he doesn't seem to actually understand it like I have a%0a52:51%0abetter grasp on it than he does I mean I mean he said that he would that he had a%0a52:57%0achemistry course in university but he said he would have studied it until like%0a53:05%0asemester two or something that would be my equivalent and everything you do is until then learn how at least in%0a53:13%0apractical chemistry like what like my my chemistry knowledge for the most part is%0a53:20%0abecause the chemistry I had in at university was basically like high level%0a53:28%0ahigh school with high school chemistry it was very helpful MSM or less not more%0a53:35%0athan high school and and I was able like I was able to tell W Singh was [ __ ]%0a53:41%0alike it doesn't say that much yeah what what I was really curious about is why%0a53:46%0ahe thought that nuclear reactions for context of chemistry that's literally%0a53:51%0anot how chemistry is defined but that's what I at least got from it and so that%0a53:57%0aI think a couple of others in indicate at least that that what he was talking about was cold fusion yeah it works%0a54:04%0aah he's talking about he's talking about starting like yeah combining elements%0a54:13%0athe nuclei have R elements to create heavy elements that from being cold fusion because it's not at high%0a54:18%0atemperatures yeah so like as far as I know like chemistry is not circular%0a54:25%0aphysics yeah chemistry basically deals with the electron shells around okay how they%0a54:32%0abehave you know I had and cells are totally irrelevant for chemistry not solely relevant just like no I mean I%0a54:39%0amean they're they have that we could theoretically describe them only by us being%0a54:44%0apoints with a certain medicine with a certain charge that's enough yeah then being composed of neutral and new%0a54:50%0atranspire yeah yeah yeah the structure doesn't matter but they're all completely irrelevant they do not matter%0a54:57%0ayeah some if it does I set that structures irrelevant yeah I think%0a55:04%0athat's what confused me because I actually managed to follow some of the conversation and I don't know [ __ ] all about chemistry so it had to be like%0a55:10%0aunrelated to chemistry as far as I know well it was a lot of it was like it was%0a55:16%0aon the border between physics and chemistry both physically I have in%0a55:21%0aterms of Yasim and sort of more well of the subject like let's let's grab me%0a55:28%0aright like I know [ __ ] all about chemistry nor physics north declare%0a55:34%0aphysics etc etc and even I even I got from it but it was like not chemistry%0a55:40%0abut rather something else so mm-hmm I think I think it's pretty sure like%0a55:46%0aone thing is bida telling must to water-ski in here when said after you%0a55:52%0asaid that you're dealing you're dealing with electron volts not volts he%0a55:59%0abasically said oh oh so we need a can we need some way to like converse some way to convert it yeah which is just like I%0a56:06%0adon't think she actually got understood what you actually said okay yeah though%0a56:13%0ato understand they don't understand electron volts basically a unit of energy here basically at the badly but%0a56:21%0ayeah it's it's indeed a bad name the name comes from em if you have an electron and you pass it through an%0a56:26%0aelectric field with a potential difference of one volt then the electron will have one electron volt of kinetic%0a56:32%0aenergy afterwards that's the definition of an electron volt yeah and the reason which is the reason that this is useful%0a56:39%0ais because when you're dealing with atomic atomic numbers I've been doing%0a56:44%0athis entire thing in joules would be really annoying because the numbers would be really small so an electron%0a56:52%0avolt is a rather good a good way to to calculate it%0a56:58%0ait just it's not the best name Union if it's a convenient unit that's the point yeah yeah but the main name is sort of%0a57:05%0astupid because it's kind of like it implies yeah exactly well that's not the problem yeah yeah%0a57:11%0alike mr. United for the children says isn't it more alchemy than chemistry or%0a57:18%0aphysics I see him toiling over a huge Black Cauldron dropping frog tails and eyes of Newt into it into the boiling%0a57:26%0asmoking concoction um is now a time to point out that I%0a57:31%0ahave nude and far tails I actually just code word for code words for plans%0a57:37%0awhat's okay when when all when all like like witches things talk talk about like%0a57:45%0athese gross things like I have new tales of frogs um they are actually using a%0a57:52%0a[ __ ] ID code but would or like old names for specific medical medical like%0a57:57%0amedical herbs and stuff like that still like I I pretty much see the same thing%0a58:05%0ain my mind every day like if I did that in boiling another%0a58:12%0apiss with which was one way someone thought he was gonna get go very thunder%0a58:18%0aabout yeah I found phosphorus Amber's yeah yeah he basically concentrated urine until%0a58:27%0ahey I don't know the exact process just sir and yeah I feel wondering how he%0a58:33%0agets because there's a lot of other stuff in your employ a lot of the real%0a58:38%0ait may be I don't know maybe and you boil it until justice as just solid left%0a58:45%0aand then then you burn that and try to if you heat up if you heat up career%0a58:52%0adoes it then he said then decompose into ammonia and see if you like it does when%0a59:00%0ayou split with an unsub yeah shut to area Oh what would that's what you get%0a59:10%0aout a thing is here to in a second they are%0a59:15%0atalking about badly chat oh so I could spell also you have missed%0a59:25%0asomething yesterday oh my god no no no I watched yeah you watched okay yeah yeah%0a59:35%0aI'm if you're a you raise brakes you race which is an enzyme breaks urea into%0a59:44%0abut it okay it's combined with the water that's why yeah they mean the organizations or the oxidation state of%0a59:51%0athe carbon atom is obviously +4 so that's why it makes sense that the%0a59:56%0aentrance of this year to obviously I mean come on who doesn't know this yeah%0a1:00:04%0aI mean everybody knows it was taken high school chemistry well I haven't taken high school chemistry because I'm a%0a1:00:10%0a[ __ ] idiot but I do know patiently videos well this%0a1:00:19%0athe revealing is for justice is for you race which is literally like an enzyme%0a1:00:25%0athat breaks down the main component of P it can literally cut your P in pieces%0a1:00:31%0aand yeah that no PP cutting to basically%0a1:00:37%0ain my chemical katana super leaf an%0a1:00:42%0aenzyme a lot of enzymes do that do that kind of [ __ ] that would be a simple but%0a1:00:50%0alike our little our little mesh or little tools and machinery and building%0a1:00:55%0ablocks yeah they're bad catalysts without them we wouldn't run and they%0a1:01:03%0athey roll way yeah they lower the activation energy of the different reactions in our body%0a1:01:09%0ayeah so very rare case but is that happening wouldn't happen at the temperature yet at the speed that they%0a1:01:15%0aare without them yeah if they didn't have if we didn't have to happen we would have to have like like so like%0a1:01:23%0ait's a lot of degrees high about the temperature I see function and then we would catch on fire yeah what what do you guys think%0a1:01:32%0aabout his claim that gold would be found as the gold that would be found in%0a1:01:37%0asewage would be an education of the processes right guys not you know it's%0a1:01:42%0anot it comes from because you like sewage also just doesn't just like you%0a1:01:47%0asaid like plants and an animal like they don't need jobs like a lot of sewage%0a1:01:53%0acomes from industry as well and yes I pointed out for example electronic waste what we want for well not even that like%0a1:02:00%0agold is used as a catalyst and some in some thing is the catalyst is used in%0a1:02:08%0asome care like production of some chemicals or other coding in some some%0a1:02:15%0aequipment but yeah the coding sure but I'm currently not aware of any%0a1:02:21%0alarge-scale industrial chemical process that uses directly goes with the catalyst core production I think the day%0a1:02:30%0ayou should platinum at least at least platinum platinum is widely used but%0a1:02:35%0agold as far as I'm aware I actually I figured out there are a lot of like yeah%0a1:02:41%0aindustrial things +44 stuff and that's how it ends up in the water biggest yeah%0a1:02:47%0abut or comes like the mauryans of the same sewage system as true and poopy%0a1:02:55%0ayeah and don't forget how many newlyweds dropped accidentally dropped their ring%0a1:03:01%0ainto the toilet onto a pile of [ __ ] and it gets flushed into the sewers I don't%0a1:03:08%0athink that's the catechol he was talking about goals because you could obviously see that that sort of course would be a%0a1:03:15%0ahuman waste and you guys may be the wrong word but race but also also he's%0a1:03:21%0awrong that we don't need gold you can there are you can get gold snaps yeah%0a1:03:27%0alook and you can get this weird gold plate thing is you know for the shakiness have you not almost so if he%0a1:03:34%0awants to see someone eat go you can go to BuzzFeed like they have these crazy like like a three-dollar thing versus a%0a1:03:41%0a$3,000 thing and most most of the things they eat that are crazy expensive are either coats in truffle or gold like the%0a1:03:49%0aactual like wait wait can you get truffles colder than gold yes you%0a1:03:55%0aprobably can yes no I have I've watched them eat it%0a1:04:00%0athere's there's even like I think it's the world's most expensive pizza whatever it is and it's talked with with%0a1:04:06%0awith truffles and gold Leafs I don't know you're [ __ ] dying with us know%0a1:04:12%0aas mr. unite for the cousin says Goldschlager yeah%0a1:04:17%0ais it I think it that's a drink right yes uh hearing nouns we also have a%0a1:04:23%0adrink which like this strong a strong ish likert-type deal with with golden%0a1:04:30%0ait's it's it we call a gold strike you think it's [ __ ] disgusting I didn't I didn't even know ago schlager%0a1:04:36%0ait's some sort of it sighs I guess like I said don't don't mess around old maps%0a1:04:44%0athere you go there's a BuzzFeed article about gold coated things you can buy and eat yeah%0a1:04:49%0awe have like a gold strike here in in the Netherlands which is just strong liquor type view which disgusting with a%0a1:04:56%0alittle bits of gold leaf in it so yeah I wonder how it goes if they probably%0a1:05:04%0ataste much it's prolly tasteless it's like pro like that against the edge of a%0a1:05:11%0acoin well what extra thing then Ben Tate there is that but there is also%0a1:05:17%0atemperature thing because get it we have a hold in the beginning of the day of%0a1:05:23%0abeautiful and and temperature effects a taste a lot hmm maybe tastes like it%0a1:05:29%0aprobably tastes like silver wait I might have a little silver coin over here give me a second%0a>>%3c%3c

Arsenic rich pyrite contains gold [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlin–type_gold_deposit|#]] so perhaps the arsenic helps create sulfur vacancies like chloride creates oxygen vacancies. Likely yes, arsenic combines with sulfur to produce realgar which means the arsenic can bind the sulfur and pull it from the structure. However since sulfur is needed to make gold, there couldn't be large areas of gold produced since the vacancies would inhibit gold production from continuing since the missing sulfurs were actually needed to make gold. So the arsenic destabilizes the structure allowing fusion, but it also removes a necessary ingredient which prevents the reaction from continuing after the first collapse. This is why carlin type deposits produce microscopic gold%0a

Iron3iodide is possible but harder to produce than iron2iodide so iodine should be used sparingly for now so it doesn't reduce our iron we are trying to keep +3 to dope for the +4 titanium. Dead sea salts do contain trace iodide but more bromide, and much more chloride. So since these halogens stabilize oxygen vacancies, and doping iron for titanium creates oxygen vacancies, we can mix iron3salicylate with dead sea salt, and then temper the calcium copper titanate with that mix, to create and stabilize oxygen vacancies. Then we can go in with hydrogen sulfide and telluride and a touch of phosphine to swap the halogens with chalcogens and cause the neutron creation and collapse.

We need 3 irons and 2 oxygens and in tio4 iron doped it would be 1 iron for every 4 oxygens so we can afford to loose lots of oxygens to vacancies. Goodness, actually sulfur is 32 amu so that means it is possible that instead of oxygen it could be 3 irons and 1 sulfur. Oxygen vacancies cause defect assisted electron transport. Ovs increase affinity for ions and molecules. Ovs as electron capture sites can modify coordination structure and electronic states of adsorbed reactant, therefore activating them, which could mean conversion of H2S to HS radical. Yes it is shown ovs can convert adsorbed O2 to O2 radical by trapping and transporting plasmonic hot electrons. Oxygen vacancies create oxygen radicals more effectively than hydroxyls create radicals (but hydroxyls induce ovs so are probably good to have). Ovs activate reactants by weakening their bond or changing their bond angle. Picture on page 2103 figure 14e shows that with excess ovs some of the manganese atoms are squished tiny, which could be what we need to create fusion. Page 2104 shows that when a molecule like co2 goes to ov the electrons around the ov are injected into it creating CO radical. The same can happen with h2s to HS radical, which would then collapse with 3 iron 55's (from the tellurium neutrons) to produce gold. Hydrogen peroxide from oxygen reduction can also be facilitated by oxygen vacancies. Page 2108 anion and cation defects synergize to change the charge density and catalyze reactions better and even be better at energy storage perhaps [[capacitor]]. Excessive ov's trap electrons liberated from valence band and prevent them from entering the conduction band, this new band is called an impurity band. This decreases electronic conductivity (a good thing to cause structural collapse and fusion?). Surface ov help catalysis but bulk (deep in lattice) ov act as charge capture center and inhibit electron-hole separation (a good thing for fusion?). Synergy may exist between OVs and cation (like Fe) doping for catalysis. This ion doping can stabilize oxygen vacancies as well.%0a---%0a> Excessive ov's may trap electrons and restrain electron mobility which is bad for solar cells but for fusion might be good.

Besides lead and mercury, bismuth is probably best followed by gold. Research neutron number [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_number|#]]. Selenium and iodine are also good as is lithium and barium. Iodine is probably a little too volatile and many others aren't volatile enough and will contaminate the product.

Phosphorus, boron, tin, bromine also have slight neutron excess. Potassium iodide might be good because it is less volatile than iodine metal and once the iodine volatilizes it would provide hydroxyls for making oxygen vacancies. Actually odd neutron number is probably good [[ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_number|#]] so tellurium (7.9%25 odd) and selenium (7.6%25 odd) are some of the only ones besides berylium and tin. Platinum has highly abundant odd neutron isotope and has excess neutrons so would be a good neutron source.

Titanium has 12%25 odd and a few excess neutrons.%0a%3c %0a%3c We need max? 3 neutrons for every sulfur atom that is used to make an atom of gold. Each tellurium provides 23 neutrons.

We should also have neutron moderator to create slow neutrons so they are easier for the iron to capture. Water, graphite, beryllium, and hydrocarbons (like [[bone oil]]) can work [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_moderator|#]]. Iron should probably be 1:1 mol:mol to titanium but should be 2x excess. Sulfur should be 1 mol for every 3 mol iron that dopes titanium (so sulfur should be 1:3 mol:mol with titanium - not the excess iron), but should be 3x excess since it will be a gas and a lot will get lost. Carbon (bone oil) should be 1:1? mol:mol with sulfur/te mix but should be 1.5x excess especially since it is a neutron moderator. Excess means should probably have double what is required unless otherwise stated. Boron is a neutron absorber so shouldn't be used, same with normal (light) water.%0a

diff:1673106981:1673072158:=193,197d192%0a%3c Excessive ov's may trap electrons and restrain electron mobility which is bad for solar cells but for fusion might be good. We need 3 irons and 2 oxygens and in tio4 iron doped it would be 1 iron for every 4 oxygens so we can afford to loose lots of oxygens to vacancies. Goodness, actually sulfur is 32 amu so that means it is possible that instead of oxygen it could be 3 irons and 1 sulfur. Oxygen vacancies cause defect assisted electron transport. Ovs increase affinity for ions and molecules. Ovs as electron capture sites can modify coordination structure and electronic states of adsorbed reactant, therefore activating them, which could mean conversion of H2S to HS radical. Yes it is shown ovs can convert adsorbed O2 to O2 radical by trapping and transporting plasmonic hot electrons. Oxygen vacancies create oxygen radicals more effectively than hydroxyls create radicals (but hydroxyls induce ovs so are probably good to have). Ovs activate reactants by weakening their bond or changing their bond angle. Picture on page 2103 figure 14e shows that with excess ovs some of the manganese atoms are squished tiny, which could be what we need to create fusion. Page 2104 shows that when a molecule like co2 goes to ov the electrons around the ov are injected into it creating CO radical. The same can happen with h2s to HS radical, which would then collapse with 3 iron 55's (from the tellurium neutrons) to produce gold. Hydrogen peroxide from oxygen reduction can also be facilitated by oxygen vacancies.%0a%3c %0a%3c Tellurium is very neutron rich so a little bit might enhance amounts of iron 55 and reduce mercury production. Besides lead and mercury, bismuth is probably best followed by gold. Research neutron number [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_number|#]]. Selenium and iodine are also good as is lithium and barium. Iodine is probably a little too volatile and many others aren't volatile enough and will contaminate the product. Tellurium might be ideal since it will volatilize along with the sulfur, so just a little may be needed say 5%25 of the sulfur should be tellurium, selenium would function similarly to tellurium it just has fewer excess neutrons. Phosphorus, boron, tin, bromine also have slight neutron excess. Potassium iodide might be good because it is less volatile than iodine metal and once the iodine volatilizes it would provide hydroxyls for making oxygen vacancies. Actually odd neutron number is probably good [[ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_number|#]] so tellurium (7.9%25 odd) and selenium (7.6%25 odd) are some of the only ones besides berylium and tin. Platinum has highly abundant odd neutron isotope and has excess neutrons so would be a good neutron source. Barium is 17.8%25 odd neutrons and has excess so would also be great, probably as barium titanate which also has even higher piezoelectric coefficient than calcium copper titanate. Titanium has 12%25 odd and a few excess neutrons.%0a%3c %0a%3c We need max? 3 neutrons for every sulfur atom that is used to make an atom of gold. Each tellurium provides 23 neutrons. This would mean we need 1 mol of tellurium for every 7.667 moles sulfur, however since only 8%25 are fissile perhaps instead of 13%25 moles, 38.2%25 moles te to s would be better. We should also have neutron moderator to create slow neutrons so they are easier for the iron to capture. Water, graphite, beryllium, and hydrocarbons (like [[bone oil]]) can work [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_moderator|#]]. Iron should probably be 1:1 mol:mol to titanium but should be 2x excess. Sulfur should be 1 mol for every 3 mol iron that dopes titanium (so sulfur should be 1:3 mol:mol with titanium - not the excess iron), but should be 3x excess since it will be a gas and a lot will get lost. Carbon (bone oil) should be 1:1? mol:mol with sulfur/te mix but should be 1.5x excess especially since it is a neutron moderator. Excess means should probably have double what is required unless otherwise stated. Boron is a neutron absorber so shouldn't be used, same with normal (light) water.%0a

Ovs are from breaking m-o bonds and chromium harder than iron which is harder than manganese which is harder than cobalt which is harder than nickel. Ev's related to formation enthalpies of the metal oxide, an indicator of m-o bond strength. Amorphous more prone to OV than crystalline. Strain both compressive and tensile can aid in ov formation, but compressive strain may increase Ev needed. However may make collapse more probable if oxygen vacancies do form. Also a high dielectric constant may aid in piezoelectric squeezing of the iron oxide when charged. Inducing oxygen vacancies takes around 0.2-2 eV. I am guessing to get collapse of the structure and fusion via muon oxygen vacancy intermediates is up to a couple hundred times higher(since a muon is 207x an electron [[https://www.energy.gov/science/doe-explainsmuons|#]] ) say 50-500 eV. when low valence ions like M3+or M2+exist in MO2, VOs are created to maintain the electrostatic balance, which means Fe3+ doping SiO2 would induce oxygen vacancies. More oxygen vacancies are generated at low temps like 300c. EPR measures unpaired electrons and electrons are trapped at oxygen vacancies. Au nanoparticles induced oxygen vacancies in TiO2, which could mean producing some gold causes a cascade to produce more. Cu doping of TiO2 caused near identical oxygen vacancy induction, like for 6%25 copper doped, there was 8%25 oxygen vacancies. Oxygen vacancies disappear when heated to 400k in oxygen. Carbon monoxide CO is very good at creating oxygen vacancies because it scrubs oxygen, which is created combusting hydrocarbons or charcoal in low oxygen environments. Oxygen vacancies can accept electrons from light irradiation from the valence band VB and bring them to the conduction band CB. Ov's promote charge transfer. OVs act as positive charge centers to attract electrons, perhaps if it gets 207 electrons then it becomes a muon and can catalyze a structural collapse into fusion.

Or maybe it just makes the iron3oxide a better dielectric.%0a%3c %0a%3c We know the electron donor is typically HS and acceptor is iron3oxide and the dielectric is the transferrer. The transferrer is like a yoyo electrons being pushed and pulled within the structure. I'm just trying to figure out what the chelator does to the iron oxide, originally I thought to help oxygen vacancies form. Yes if the irons are coordinated with chelators, the oxygens would be free to leave. Or what may be happening is the chelator helps the iron3+ to dope another dielectric-like material thus leading to inherent oxygen vacancies.%0a%3c %0a%3c Hydroxyl groups (OH) introduce oxygen vacancies [[https://www.nature.com/articles/s42004-019-0112-9|#]] which means they either coordinate with the metal oxide allowing oxygen to leave or they bond directly to the oxygen pulling it out.%0a%3c %0a%3c Oxygen vacancies in metal oxides review [[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/341542284_Oxygen_vacancies_in_metal_oxides_recent_progress_towards_advanced_catalyst_design|#]] ov's increase electrical conductivity. Formed by heat under vacuum, chemical reduction, ion doping (so perhaps chelating iron allows iron to dope out its own oxygens?), And interfacial engineering. Jahn-teller distortion (oxygens get closer) due to different metal replacing (doping) a metal site. This would probably cause the oxygens to combine to O2 and outgas easier? Oxygens can also be reduced with something gas forming like H2 to produce H2O with the oxygens or CO to form CO2 with the oxygens and outgas. Carbon monoxide reduction more thermodynamically favorable than H2 and it actually releases energy instead of costing energy. When the oxygens are removed the bond electrons go to the nearest metal atoms reducing them. Localized electrons will form at the ov's probably from the broken bonds and can this create muons?%0a%3c \\STRATEGIES TO CREATE OVs%0a%3c \\Numerous synthetic strategies have been developed to%0a%3c \\create OVs in metal oxides, e.g., high-energy particle%0a%3c \\bombardment, high-temperature calcination, chemical%0a%3c \\reduction, ion doping, and tuning the heterostructure%0a%3c \\interface, all of which facilitate the escape of O atoms%0a%3c \\Oxygens bound to atoms with more positive charge 3+ for example, or larger ion radius, are more likely to leave. Plasma engraving induces ovs. Higher temperature and longer calcination time in oxygen deficient conditions increases oxygen vacancies as long as it is below pyrolysis temp, but even a couple hundred degrees under decomposition temp may be too high, as co3o4 reduced oxygen vacancies when heated to 700c when decomposition is 900c. Hematite decomposes at 1200-1390c [[https://chemiday.com/en/reaction/3-1-0-5401|#]]. So probably we could combine dielectric with chelated iron oxide and heat to 800c for several hours under vacuum or sealed chamber to create vacancies, carbon monoxide is wood gas. Interestingly doping Fe3+ into a position in a M4+ position can produce high oxygen vacancy iron3oxide. The role of the chelator may be to facilitate the doping of iron into another 4+ cation (M4+) position. Also Fe3+ could substitute in for another M3+ material if the M3+ ion is larger than Fe3+, like perhaps a molybdenum3oxide. The presence of 1 ov speeds up the second and so on. Doping helps achieve the first. Oxygen adjacent to the doped cation more likely to overflow (form O2 gas and leave). Anion doping with N,C,P,F,S in place of oxygen also can work.%0a%3c %0a%3c Iron can dope for titanium in strontium titanate (and probably calcium copper titanate) [[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1567173917303073|#]]%0a%3c %0a%3c Strontium titanate high in oxygen vacancies [[https://www.science.gov/topicpages/d/doped+strontium+titanate.html|#]]%0a%3c %0a%3c Oxygen vacancies are friends [[https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5143309|#]]%0a

least I know where my%0a> 1:08:06%0a> he hooker she comes from what is that they say everything in moderation I say%0a> 1:08:13%0a> works for them like that Levin yeah because everything in moderation%0a> 1:08:18%0a> acceptance let uranium and Mercury and stuff like that there there are a lot of%0a> 1:08:24%0a> things that weather where there are notes like safe service they've level up I was going to ask what's the actual%0a> 1:08:30%0a> talk toxicity or like how much do you need to consume oh let's see whether%0a> 1:08:36%0a> LME's if because I mean you you consume some naturally anyway well it's done I%0a> 1:08:43%0a> would let it's gonna depend on if it's if it's found so anything like because%0a> 1:08:50%0a> there are it's David mercury if it's like pure mercury like the slowly level%0a> 1:08:55%0a> stuff myself is surprisingly not that toxic but once you start combining it%0a> 1:09:02%0a> with them with organic where Alex so you have you have a mercury bounce to some%0a> 1:09:08%0a> organic molecule that's when you start getting problems so IP finally in the new file look like Anna what's called%0a> 1:09:16%0a> aggregate or some or in it well well it basically needs something like because our your body deals for mechanic stuff%0a> 1:09:23%0a> so it kind of needs like oh okay yeah sorry like kind of like hijacks the%0a> 1:09:29%0a> organic material and gets consumed by the yeah we're not worried your body your body doesn't really like like sweet%0a> 1:09:35%0a> pure metals like pure all non ion metals a lot they it's not something your body%0a> 1:09:41%0a> really is really used to handling yeah I mean if the metals are reactive enough%0a> 1:09:49%0a> they will obviously react with the stomach acid but though yes microblog said that the metal itself is usually%0a> 1:09:55%0a> quite harmless it's the ions that relate the problem for example for example mercury when you drink pure mercury the%0a> 1:10:02%0a> toxicity is really not so much the problem because it goes one pain in one and and leaves on the other but yeah%0a> 1:10:09%0a> again a organic compounds with mercury%0a> 1:10:14%0a> are really [ __ ] toxic so so stupid stupid chemistry question if it related%0a> 1:10:20%0a> - the same the same reason why we have certain metals as additives / accelerant%0a> 1:10:28%0a> / aggravates or whatever they're called in in in shots like vaccines and [ __ ]%0a> 1:10:34%0a> because I know they come for male yeah your thing of aluminum yeah no the reason the reason there is%0a> 1:10:41%0a> aluminum in I has it has it has this good name please call an adjunctive the%0a> 1:10:50%0a> junkman @h event I'm not your husband answer but it's basically um um it's in%0a> 1:10:59%0a> there because it triggers an immune reaction which increases the amount of%0a> 1:11:05%0a> antibodies produced the basically makes the vaccine work work better yeah also it's the reason why you get%0a> 1:11:12%0a> why you get like get a brick can get there and so the answer actually you%0a> 1:11:18%0a> think is better that's do you mean the action - yeah so aluminium or aluminum yeah I was really%0a> 1:11:26%0a> like if that's the same kind of chemical reaction as if it's a heavy metal is hijacking some organic material or well%0a> 1:11:33%0a> that's absolutely different all aluminum is a heavy metal a single size 5 ml and I wouldn't be so sure about that because%0a> 1:11:40%0a> there it is has no no it has no official definition of what the heavy metal actually is that's true but it is it is%0a> 1:11:46%0a> aluminum is usually like in terms of like health and biology is usually%0a> 1:11:52%0a> touched by a heavy metal to give both you and it's toxic like mercury isn't%0a> 1:11:58%0a> like certain of aluminum or aluminium it's like it's not healthy for you%0a> 1:12:03%0a> well but it has a reservoir at a higher but you need to like you need to get a%0a> 1:12:11%0a> lot of it yeah well I mean you can seem pretty much all metals

paint chips as a kid but you're not%0a> 1:14:05%0a> alone you're not at the low end of the bell curve that's the point so there will always somebody who is more idiotic%0a> 1:14:12%0a> than you well table one should always strive to surround themselves with people that are smarter than you so do%0a> 1:14:18%0a> you have the ability to learn well that's the thing like I I used to be a very smart kid%0a> 1:14:24%0a> not anymore it made sure of that yeah that I was very more than some of%0a> 1:14:30%0a> these idiots which I'm really really%0a> 1:14:36%0a> looking forward to actually seeing nature trying to do this experiment%0a> 1:14:41%0a> you know actually did you know if he has uploaded any footage of the experiment because I think I think you probably%0a> 1:14:48%0a> really wouldn't a little bit okay yeah I mean I wrote that but I didn't find it%0a> 1:14:55%0a> anywhere I did that on his YouTube channel I mean he's running another website but I haven't taken a look at%0a> 1:15:00%0a> that one can you imagine if he accidentally just [ __ ] started collision that [ __ ] [ __ ] happens you%0a> 1:15:10%0a> know what I would do I would literally just destroy myself a [ __ ] roof if that is if that happens we have to steal%0a> 1:15:17%0a> the ideas I steal the glory from him the credit for ramen because he cannot be%0a> 1:15:23%0a> the one who gets the [ __ ] platforming Nobel Prize well as awesome [ __ ] I will be stealing it from all of you%0a> 1:15:28%0a> [ __ ] guys I will be the smart one he would probably be be it be some or do it%0a> 1:15:35%0a> somewhere somehow that I would like just accidentally do it and I have no [ __ ]%0a> 1:15:40%0a> idea how to repeat it but that's something I would do since it's well I%0a> 1:15:45%0a> mean we we don't have we don't have to we would have have the advantages that%0a> 1:15:50%0a> we would know and we will know the publicity is in peer-reviewed literature%0a> 1:15:56%0a> which is how you get a Nobel Prize yeah a bio loading into YouTube but youtube%0a> 1:16:02%0a> is peer reviewed right right right he's in the chat hello and what kind of%0a> 1:16:12%0a> radiation do they get emitted because might be possible that with platinum%0a> 1:16:18%0a> electrolysis you might get some x-ray radiation but yeah actually what's put%0a> 1:16:25%0a> to see the veritable energy in verses like like isn't isn't it like with a%0a> 1:16:30%0a> fusion and [ __ ] like isn't it like gamma radiation or something like that%0a> 1:16:38%0a> really well recognizing and so there are three main types of nuclear radiation%0a> 1:16:48%0a> alpha rays which are typically in the%0a> 1:16:54%0a> military today that is either electrons or positrons like gamma radiation which are high-energy photons which is%0a> 1:17:01%0a> ionizing great yeah yeah yeah so pretty much there are like lesson three may%0a> 1:17:07%0a> remain sighs we have like weird soft failures and murders yes there are%0a> 1:17:12%0a> electron texturing processes and even proton emissions and yeah but that's%0a> 1:17:18%0a> kind of well that's rather rant you only find it in really exotic isotopes for example um there are some isotopes with%0a> 1:17:25%0a> a really high a proton to Neutron Neutron ratio where you actually get proton emission yeah okay so he says%0a> 1:17:34%0a> yeah I think it was x-ray but still but that's what he says well guess what%0a> 1:17:40%0a> like in all yes they have an x-ray machine in there and there's no fusion%0a> 1:17:45%0a> reactor there yeah that small as my point in order to have evidence of%0a> 1:17:51%0a> nuclear reactions you actually need one of the three reaction one of the 3d edge%0a> 1:17:56%0a> radiation types that I was talking about can I swap the optin or I don't get a%0a> 1:18:04%0a> you you you don't only get x-rays from nuclear reactions what do you gamble is%0a> 1:18:10%0a> what when what one one an electrode put it leaves or whatever an electron no%0a> 1:18:18%0a> gamma is bases that you have an abundance of energy in in the nucleus%0a> 1:18:26%0a> it's not the electrons like that would be like a massive message like you have to like basic fall down and yes for%0a> 1:18:34%0a> example for example in when you're talking about x-rays what happens is%0a> 1:18:40%0a> that an electron will which is in the high energy state falls down into a lower initial state and the difference%0a> 1:18:45%0a> of energy is emitted eggs as a photon for example as an x-ray photon the same applies to%0a> 1:18:51%0a> um nuclei only that the energies are much higher therefore you get a higher energy of the photon and that's what a%0a> 1:18:57%0a> gamma-ray is well I I know what garish it's some serious death that's what it is%0a> 1:19:02%0a> yes well they're relatively speaking gammas are relatively harmless%0a> 1:19:07%0a> it's the alpha rays that kill ya if you get the emitter out of you%0a> 1:19:12%0a> yeah keyword being relatively speaking yeah it's both differences like Yemen like%0a> 1:19:19%0a> most of the gamma radiations just gonna pass right through you yeah it's it's%0a> 1:19:24%0a> the gamma radiation that is not passing through you that kills you yeah but yeah%0a> 1:19:30%0a> we gamma radiation that really reacts in your body is already and ionisers a%0a> 1:19:36%0a> molecule in your body it's relatively small yeah where is it where is yeah I'll read a little problem when you have%0a> 1:19:43%0a> it in the idea because you I don't know leak uranium or something that really%0a> 1:19:49%0a> gets you well I caused by for example alpha radiation cannot pass paper also it%0a> 1:19:55%0a> means that other emitted alpha particles will ionize that paper well is a%0a> 1:20:02%0a> wavelength issue or would know what it is it's a matter that ultimately%0a> 1:20:07%0a> extraction of her well where alpha particles cause young helium nuclei give%0a> 1:20:13%0a> the message something oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah well I think back to the%0a> 1:20:19%0a> elephant's foot in Chernobyl yesterday I look at that go on just Google what that%0a> 1:20:25%0a> chain is oh yeah I know I know what Yelp and for this yeah for those who don't%0a> 1:20:31%0a> know the elephant what is a piece of basically molten well it most multi-use%0a> 1:20:38%0a> I will after of the reactor it is not just real isn't it still technically the%0a> 1:20:45%0a> most radioactive place on the planet that's what the thing is radioactive is%0a> 1:20:50%0a> [ __ ] it's so radioactive that or like all the pages have been taken off and I%0a> 1:20:55%0a> like that you can see that the damage is to them and Wednesday when like like%0a> 1:21:02%0a> right up that you know what happens they they flew over the area like the fool%0a> 1:21:07%0a> over grx and took pictures and like the pictures were like fine when they took%0a> 1:21:12%0a> them but then like it didn't take it was like when they actually brought them back they were like they look like [ __ ]%0a> 1:21:19%0a> because the radiation had just [ __ ] up the film yes so it's not only photos you can also see that in videos of%0a> 1:21:25%0a> helicopter footage flying out of the reactor that is sparkling effects on the%0a> 1:21:31%0a> on the film and that is a direct cause of radiated irradiation hitting hitting%0a> 1:21:36%0a> the film yes that's the reason why when you know in a lot of us of that%0a> 1:21:42%0a> elephant's foot thing like nothing looks gnarly like if you see like the all the%0a> 1:21:48%0a> distortions on the picture like you don't want to get close to that [ __ ] thing at least three [ __ ] leaders so%0a> 1:21:54%0a> you want to get close to the thing at least three kilometres I don't believe it did yeah did you guys ever ever watch%0a> 1:22:04%0a> the hangout that Fiona Robertson had about it was one of like it was none%0a> 1:22:11%0a> meltdown or anything but it's one of the the worst the worst radiation related%0a> 1:22:17%0a> accidents that wasn't like a meltdown in I think it was Japan where two people%0a> 1:22:24%0a> actually died two people on their own saved the entire plant by and I'm afraid%0a> 1:22:32%0a> I forget exactly how it happened but it was something like they closed%0a> 1:22:37%0a> they closed something that was highly highly highly radioactive and it they essentially became two case studies on%0a> 1:22:44%0a> on extreme radiation as they died no I haven't had off that case to be honest%0a> 1:22:49%0a> wasn't interesting to him to at least read about it it's I think Fiona posted%0a> 1:22:55%0a> papers on it and [ __ ] and it was like he got [ __ ] nasty like what one other%0a> 1:23:01%0a> guy like did this the skin and flesh would actually let go of his bone structure ah I actually got a picture of%0a> 1:23:10%0a> the elephant's foot and it's it's it's an eerie [ __ ] picture yeah basically%0a> 1:23:16%0a> just them open clump of metal that's cool oh these pictures actually it's so distorted like%0a> 1:23:23%0a> there were people standing in front of it and it's so distort that they are like disappearing on the big syringe%0a> 1:23:28%0a> it's [ __ ] weird tonight yeah you guys know what the demon coils yes I know%0a> 1:23:35%0a> loudness that's so that even covers about a piece of truth Sonia my think that was used in the development of%0a> 1:23:42%0a> hydrogen bombs yeah and there were two individual accidents with that car over%0a> 1:23:48%0a> the club of plutonium but one's a bit like so somebody actually dropped to two%0a> 1:23:54%0a> parts of two-tone IAM together and the reaction was thought and then he kicked he kicked one of them away but a%0a> 1:24:00%0a> direction had always started so much that he would die later thirty-eight embroider and then after and then afterwards a%0a> 1:24:07%0a> group of scientists tried to recreate the accident and the entire thing happened again%0a> 1:24:12%0a> well it didn't that like was a good thing like very close to what's called%0a> 1:24:20%0a> critical mass yeah it was what's the point I did too are they did the drop down%0a> 1:24:26%0a> might be a neutron reflector made of tungsten that I dropped on it and then%0a> 1:24:33%0a> it would reach critical mass and start reacting the congress-led later used as a part of a hydrogen bomb in the bikini%0a> 1:24:40%0a> at all the stars are aware I'm actually sharing the picture of the elephant's food right now yeah it's eerie [ __ ]%0a> 1:24:46%0a> picture right how do I have in show you I don't want to get close to that [ __ ]%0a> 1:24:53%0a> thing well I think I just got ten thousand times the recommended amount of%0a> 1:25:00%0a> radiation how many bananas I have to go%0a> 1:25:06%0a> yes bananas is is a unit of radiation oh%0a> 1:25:12%0a> that's something I should have asked nature hacker because he claimed in a video that he would be able to heal%0a> 1:25:18%0a> radiation yeah which is which fruit%0a> 1:25:24%0a> unless feel the most radiation II if you want if Norman if you're standing on%0a> 1:25:31%0a> [ __ ] you prolly Slimer ginge die so I've heard you prolly to the radiation%0a> 1:25:37%0a> I've heard that if you're standing close to a highly radioactive source the air%0a> 1:25:42%0a> tastes metally yeah - look land well I've stood close to a bar of%0a> 1:25:48%0a> uranium-238 but I didn't feel anything yeah or it depends of what well well%0a> 1:25:54%0a> your areas where one of the professors of the University we're back he's doing a risk research in uranium%0a> 1:26:02%0a> complex chemistry and si as I saw so uranium he has simply a metal block of%0a> 1:26:09%0a> of uranium that he stores inside a let even isn't it like like you need to do a%0a> 1:26:17%0a> whole bunch of [ __ ] to make your radium actually dangerously radioactive uranium%0a> 1:26:25%0a> itself is not really so dangerous if you don't they ingested in some way well%0a> 1:26:32%0a> yeah well don't you have to like enriched or something like that to make it like some serious depth type of deal%0a> 1:26:39%0a> and no and when when you have pure uranium the 238 isotope will kill you if%0a> 1:26:46%0a> you ingest it well yeah it's not over sometimes you will at least get whether%0a> 1:26:51%0a> the cancer probability probability goes for the roof even in low concentrations and so forth well then again how the%0a> 1:27:01%0a> [ __ ] do I close this [ __ ] how the hell do i shut the sharing stuff I have to do%0a> 1:27:08%0a> yeah all right you have to stop sharing your screen that he was just you were just still%0a> 1:27:14%0a> being presented yeah I don't know how to do that [ __ ] yeah you know Jill consoles%0a> 1:27:19%0a> that ah but by the way jail is like just in case you haven't seen it I I linked%0a> 1:27:25%0a> the name tokheim Laura is what it's okay I'm over okay yeah that that thing%0a> 1:27:31%0a> because it I just I remember fear if you don't know how to hang a hang out about it two years ago I%0a> 1:27:37%0a> linked the the short video she made she also had a hangout lasted for like two or three hours%0a> 1:27:43%0a> uh and it did one of the reasons is Nasty's because it essentially by it%0a> 1:27:49%0a> like after the events had transpired they essentially violated everything you%0a> 1:27:55%0a> can even remotely consider to be it to be human rights and turned the guy into%0a> 1:28:01%0a> a living experiment oh yeah I see that that's I've seen that isolation shipment%0a> 1:28:06%0a> guy odd into it took 80 something day eighty seven days that meant like the%0a> 1:28:13%0a> the skin was falling off his bones it was that [ __ ] uh yeah like they couldn't get in graph statistic like it%0a> 1:28:22%0a> was just it was just falling off it I've seen that I have actually read that ship%0a> 1:28:29%0a> like radiation poisoning is one health drug that's some scary [ __ ] [ __ ] yeah%0a> 1:28:35%0a> in that case the most humane thing would probably to shoot this guy in the face yeah yeah like I don't remember the full%0a> 1:28:43%0a> story anymore but there were two people that was exposed to it and one of them died relatively quickly the other one%0a> 1:28:50%0a> unfortunately lived a long-ass time well he didn't live a long as time they%0a> 1:28:55%0a> kept him alive well yeah like that they did everything%0a> 1:29:01%0a> to keep that man alive just to see what the radiation would do to him yeah they were plugged in full of fluid to take%0a> 1:29:08%0a> him alive it's it's running too rickety diem one of the guys was exposed to%0a> 1:29:14%0a> seventeen seasons of radiation and the other one to ten usually those of eight%0a> 1:29:21%0a> fevers is um thought to be lethal yeah well I'm tensed practically a death%0a> 1:29:28%0a> sentence oh that man like I've seen pictures of it like he was lying on this [ __ ] rag type deal right and you just%0a> 1:29:38%0a> see a guy lying there without a [ __ ] skin it's pretty much that wha what what this old old guy Murad IV was like he%0a> 1:29:47%0a> was just a well a man skinned alive by radiation yes gnarly I've seen it all so%0a> 1:29:55%0a> uh this guy was called Masato Shinohara yeah well he's not Mossad to%0a> 1:30:02%0a> skin a life out huh no not anymore no he he now did well%0a> 1:30:09%0a> fortunately yeah like he should he should have just been killed yeah it's one of those cases where like%0a> 1:30:17%0a> um so a lot of medical knowledge has been gained through doing really [ __ ]%0a> 1:30:24%0a> nasty [ __ ] just like this well but it's still atrocious to treat someone like%0a> 1:30:29%0a> like oh yeah well what it mean it's an insight I don't think we've ever ever%0a> 1:30:34%0a> had that kind of insight before or since not that I justify him in any way well%0a> 1:30:39%0a> Joyce house yeah like let's do almost like like a world war ii like the what%0a> 1:30:50%0a> what Josef Mengele did like that [ __ ] [ __ ] was also [ __ ] the trolls but we did learn a lot about religion we didn't%0a> 1:30:58%0a> really learn a whole lot about from his from what he did um something that is%0a> 1:31:04%0a> she was she was yeah but for the most part he was working under basically like%0a> 1:31:09%0a> Nazi assumptions about how genetics and inheritance worked true true but the thing said that he did%0a> 1:31:17%0a> find he did record them and people were able to get that yeah maybe we didn't%0a> 1:31:24%0a> learn like we didn't blow it like follow burn piece ISM is a like a big what them%0a> 1:31:29%0a> like sort of it what's interesting in some ways yes my question is if is%0a> 1:31:36%0a> morally okay to tell you is yes no and yeah you're not in my opinion no no no%0a> 1:31:42%0a> no no sorry no it's one wrong to do it but it's not more wrong to use data against see a problem in like like you%0a> 1:31:50%0a> like the data is still dated the data still shows that it's shows there's no problem in using using it just because%0a> 1:31:56%0a> it came from them from something nasty but we wouldn't need to use this data%0a> 1:32:01%0a> today because we we have data on on those subjects%0a> 1:32:07%0a> have been acquired through ethical means Oh moral of the story though is it's%0a> 1:32:14%0a> that a lot of our medical knowledge come from very unethical ways of requiring%0a> 1:32:21%0a> those not that knowledge now most of our medical knowledge doesn't really come%0a> 1:32:28%0a> from that like UNITA comes from a an age where those things were seen as morally%0a> 1:32:36%0a> wrong or they come from a modern age where there is like there are faculty%0a> 1:32:42%0a> okay I'll tell ya housing you have been helping he one cycle the whole thing you%0a> 1:32:48%0a> see something there are like rules that protect protected during human trials I%0a> 1:32:54%0a> was told the Helsinki something and then some guy got ready it irradiated to a%0a> 1:33:02%0a> high hell and there he is lying on a [ __ ] bed stripped of all of his [ __ ] skin which is not nephew a%0a> 1:33:09%0a> duration of housing health and key right I I won't even be able to do something%0a> 1:33:18%0a> like that to someone something like that [ __ ] bad it's a but it is true that a%0a> 1:33:26%0a> lot of our medical knowledge has been learned through a lot a lot but there are we've learned a few things through%0a> 1:33:35%0a> through accidents it's so when when I talked about that I'm thinking like%0a> 1:33:41%0a> we're talking like really really really really basic stuff like gutting people to see how the organs were cutting%0a> 1:33:47%0a> people up alive to see like how does the heart beat how does in that kind of%0a> 1:33:52%0a> thing like back in back in the te Kiwi days of call it medical science in in%0a> 1:33:58%0a> quotation marks well we did that I've [ __ ] like clicking the what's it called%0a> 1:34:06%0a> our Cajun [ __ ] yeah well it from what I understand it%0a> 1:34:11%0a> also happened during some of the more modern Wars oh oh yeah the fact of like%0a> 1:34:17%0a> chemical weapons and so oh yeah yeah one one strain it once you're in a whoa whoa you suddenly are like I mean%0a> 1:34:24%0a> you already have planning to kill people so suddenly the moles become a bit more loose yeah think about like in World War%0a> 1:34:32%0a> two the the Japanese actually did [ __ ] like that and the Nazi also did [ __ ]%0a> 1:34:38%0a> like that but not with chemical weapons I've heard horror stories about some%0a> 1:34:45%0a> some of or what happened to certain peer wzm yelled a Japanese not fun monstrous%0a> 1:34:51%0a> with with the with some of those [ __ ] cancel - god damn like if you think%0a> 1:34:57%0a> about what those people did back in those times Jesus [ __ ] it's like so%0a> 1:35:04%0a> always always keep a gun on the inside of your of your jacket so you can shoot%0a> 1:35:09%0a> yourself if you get captured yeah it will so I find out capsule yeah I mean there's a reason what that is%0a> 1:35:17%0a> actually an option for people that go into like really dangerous areas well it%0a> 1:35:25%0a> won't be wrong like I rather get like a a cyanide capsule then being you for for%0a> 1:35:32%0a> human Charleston's yeah once per second I think I think actually I would much%0a> 1:35:38%0a> rather shoot myself than say a finite filthy a cyanide is not a fun waves died no I feel better than being like got it%0a> 1:35:45%0a> alive oh yeah not now resi all discussion which method of suicide is%0a> 1:35:51%0a> the best one but usually they make taken over those are some saying any love%0a> 1:35:57%0a> something you fall asleep yeah aperture rights or something is probably the best way micro sync if it's right or it's%0a> 1:36:03%0a> like Shia night or it's getting what's a%0a> 1:36:10%0a> [ __ ] eternal life I ranch well eating your life my rats wouldn't love this one%0a> 1:36:17%0a> yeah so I I would choose for the cyanide each along oh yeah no no I was comparing%0a> 1:36:22%0a> I was crying shooting myself on cyanide I've never cut for shoot myself okay yeah I played it up with honored to know%0a> 1:36:29%0a> that getting eaten alive by raft is not fun no but it's just [ __ ] people are awful%0a> 1:36:42%0a> doctor for what I think we have to tap a scientific study for this yeah good luck%0a> 1:36:48%0a> finding volunteers hit well no no good luck getting it past the ethics%0a> 1:36:54%0a> committee what is it alright right we don't listen sample size I don't like%0a> 1:37:01%0a> like I'm not against like human trials really if it's done to the right people%0a> 1:37:08%0a> like people who are condemned to death anyway like let's say let's say I laugh%0a> 1:37:17%0a> at all but hold on like they can choose like okay you can sell your body to%0a> 1:37:23%0a> let's say science a your family gets the money or you just go on on the [ __ ]%0a> 1:37:30%0a> chair you get roasting I'm alright I think you have a misconception event when you donate your body to an%0a> 1:37:36%0a> institution it's all it's after you there yes it's a few that is necessarily%0a> 1:37:42%0a> see at all here in Germany some institutions some hospital some universities actually take a fee another%0a> 1:37:49%0a> not gif yes no but not dual identity here like I deliver guys hold on shut up%0a> 1:37:56%0a> hold on like what I mean right is let's say you have you're condemned to death right and%0a> 1:38:03%0a> you can choose okay you're going to get on the chair roast it not no%0a> 1:38:11%0a> contribution to to your family no contribution to society whatsoever you get roasted dead into the ground or%0a> 1:38:19%0a> on a [ __ ] mass grave that's about it or you can choose okay Charles okay you%0a> 1:38:25%0a> will [ __ ] suffer like a [ __ ] your family will get money plus you're contributing to society and it is so%0a> 1:38:32%0a> vivid in still I'll ever call you you wouldn't you wouldn't like you give%0a> 1:38:37%0a> those people then the choice at least and then you know every time I it's so%0a> 1:38:43%0a> different no it's the it's still unethical you would never get this power passed an ethics committee no%0a> 1:38:51%0a> but also infamy LegalZoom like you would get a victim yeah I would see it has to%0a> 1:39:02%0a> be this is actually a real conversation that I had imagined for today and and%0a> 1:39:09%0a> remember I was talking to the crazy cousin of Charles Phillips no seriously%0a> 1:39:17%0a> like I I do not see a prong with that if people get to choice if they are condemned tell me you allowed to%0a> 1:39:22%0a> experiment on yourself there's no there's no there's no rules like you can%0a> 1:39:28%0a> do all the horrible [ __ ] to yourself like that is Emma's point what yep%0a> 1:39:36%0a> that's the thing like I personally think that people's when someone is condemned%0a> 1:39:41%0a> to death like that they can choose okay I can do human charge okay I live a%0a> 1:39:46%0a> little bit longer but I suffer like a [ __ ] when I family gets money and I might contribute to society yeah but but%0a> 1:39:53%0a> I rose and wouldn't it then make more sense to be executed by organ donation for example well that's that's an option%0a> 1:40:02%0a> like don't get me wrong like if they do like for controls like like you will get%0a> 1:40:07%0a> like [ __ ] an established that type of [ __ ] of course like you [ __ ] that [ __ ]%0a> 1:40:15%0a> know what I mean yeah but that's [ __ ] up anyway it is [ __ ] up but but I%0a> 1:40:23%0a> perspective that the problem is that if you're able to do the research more%0a> 1:40:28%0a> ethic in a more ethical way no one is ever gonna it's not ever gonna be%0a> 1:40:35%0a> approved like at nature I activate a good like makes one good point when you%0a> 1:40:40%0a> talk about the animal research like the reason you have to like he would he studies as he said you have to prove%0a> 1:40:47%0a> that you need to do it in rats and you can't do it in lower organisms because there are very very strict pools%0a> 1:40:54%0a> automatically and you try to use the type of animal that is the least sentient%0a> 1:41:00%0a> yeah but and the amp but still able to give you to the sort who needs and yeah%0a> 1:41:05%0a> I very valid intimated from my program I think it's only like it's only ten percent of like medical results that%0a> 1:41:13%0a> I've heard of that are found in bad that I am act like in lab rats but like that%0a> 1:41:25%0a> actually end up turning and becoming restored useful results in humans okay%0a> 1:41:31%0a> out of curiosity what would you use if I don't if you can't use the read a monkey%0a> 1:41:39%0a> will have you Marley monkey wouldn't they be a rhesus rhesus monkeys not yes%0a> 1:41:45%0a> well you know big ape so why not use like damned conflict just saying I I do%0a> 1:41:54%0a> not see the difference in a rhesus monkey or a [ __ ] because if a biggest%0a> 1:41:59%0a> a humans because the member of our own species because they are not not only that but but there's no time collect%0a> 1:42:06%0a> actually tell you that is sentient yeah it's the same ethical thing as in%0a> 1:42:12%0a> light value it's okay to eat other [ __ ] but not people because it's just a member or I do not see a problem in%0a> 1:42:21%0a> using a conflict who is going to get the%0a> 1:42:27%0a> chair anyway I do not see the problem in that but at least give them the choice and give their families a compensation%0a> 1:42:35%0a> well like the idea well that it doesn't it doesn't it almost doesn't matter what kind of crimes you've done you still%0a> 1:42:42%0a> keep your innate rights oh yeah like for the most part there's obviously exceptions%0a> 1:42:47%0a> well I mindful no yes I think there shouldn't be any exceptions you get to%0a> 1:42:53%0a> keep your human rights no matter what no I in in practice right so there's%0a> 1:42:59%0a> certain crimes for you in my opinion a powerful should not have any [ __ ] rotation all this will be used for that%0a> 1:43:06%0a> [ __ ] no what the [ __ ] those guys the problem with saying that is that you were the%0a> 1:43:11%0a> most obvious denying someone else's romantic there is a big problem in doing that because if you didn't violate his human%0a> 1:43:17%0a> rights and it turns out he was innocent yes you yeah you now have sent a%0a> 1:43:23%0a> narrative giant like you will now but the bad guy oh yeah yeah yeah Danny Lang's let me point as I am with%0a> 1:43:31%0a> to the side who loses his human rights and who isn't I mean that's a [ __ ] slippery slope right there yeah I know%0a> 1:43:37%0a> and this is actually this is one of the the the the arguments why like here nor%0a> 1:43:43%0a> will we don't actually have a life in prison or capital punishment that's because I guess the same away I think%0a> 1:43:49%0a> they lay beyond Europeans over here shop near me and we all are more Europeans%0a> 1:43:54%0a> and sorry but I do not agree with that type of [ __ ] like personally I think yes%0a> 1:43:59%0a> we should have a death penalty here and I believe it is not even a good%0a> 1:44:04%0a> punishment I give you one a punish someone spilling a life in prison is a far greater punishment then yeah having%0a> 1:44:12%0a> kill yeah I mean Michael deserves it and actually already made in my opinion but%0a> 1:44:18%0a> the point the main point is that why I am against the death penalty is we can't 100%25 make sure that somebody's really%0a> 1:44:25%0a> guilty and even though physically if you kill just just one single inmates who turns out to be innocent I said we%0a> 1:44:31%0a> can't the process yeah well it's a C so there's so there are certain cases like just just just%0a> 1:44:37%0a> just bring it up just because it's it's still kind of a relevant case it's remember the the mass shooting we had a%0a> 1:44:44%0a> Norway I think yeah yeah right yeah right doing dude like the yeah straight%0a> 1:44:49%0a> yeah so there's a lot of people that advocated the death sentence for him%0a> 1:44:55%0a> simply that like it's not a question who did it well it is that is that is%0a> 1:45:01%0a> [ __ ] us that is a closed case because like it was the only one on on the island with the kids right so it's like%0a> 1:45:07%0a> it is a closed case we know who it was and we know why did it and we know how he did it right so so it all just%0a> 1:45:14%0a> [ __ ] ass it's simple as that yeah so and then it becomes then becomes%0a> 1:45:19%0a> a different a different question right it's so one if is to remove him%0a> 1:45:27%0a> then you know kill him he's gone but he can then become a symbol for someone%0a> 1:45:33%0a> else if right so and and then the counter-argument is right now he's%0a> 1:45:40%0a> essentially continuing to be sort of like a assist to society right he's%0a> 1:45:48%0a> still hogging resources he's still being a nuisance to the society so there's the like right there you can see it from%0a> 1:45:55%0a> from both both sigh I know what you mean like yeah like they don't want him to%0a> 1:46:01%0a> become a [ __ ] martyr oh yeah of course I know that but I personally%0a> 1:46:06%0a> think pretty much this [ __ ] that guy Rose is [ __ ] it so he stops breathing%0a> 1:46:12%0a> my [ __ ] air that's [ __ ] lie like but that guy [ __ ] people like that yeah%0a> 1:46:17%0a> but it but then also again it becomes the question like if you love it for one person then then the then you have to%0a> 1:46:24%0a> stir the line somewhere like when do we allow it when do we disallow it and then%0a> 1:46:29%0a> just like Diaz said it becomes a question of okay well what if it's one%0a> 1:46:34%0a> innocent person it's just living it up with a lot of statistic in America I%0a> 1:46:40%0a> think two or three years ago that about four or five percent of everybody on death row was innocent yeah which is the%0a> 1:46:46%0a> [ __ ] disturbing which is especially like it took in the country like the states where they execute what it's like%0a> 1:46:52%0a> a couple of dozen people every every year 2030 us okay I am yeah right so the%0a> 1:46:59%0a> first like let's say 5%25 to take a relatively high number that's still we're talking a person or two a year%0a> 1:47:05%0a> right I know so it's but but still like%0a> 1:47:10%0a> I do not see a problem with using people who get the death penalty anyway to use%0a> 1:47:18%0a> the most lebreton agency so the problem becomes a slippery slope thing because%0a> 1:47:25%0a> if you if you start if you start killing people for say murder right okay well%0a> 1:47:33%0a> how do you then quantify murder in all cases because how can how can you prove%0a> 1:47:38%0a> in a case where it's uncertain if it was just killing or something that was actually%0a> 1:47:44%0a> intentional ie murder right because if it then it becomes a question of be%0a> 1:47:49%0a> honest catalyst of a doubt so it is always that slippery slope and all of a sudden if the slope is steep enough you%0a> 1:47:58%0a> can find yourself on the wrong end of it and now you don't want that enabled anymore%0a> 1:48:03%0a> great so it also there is there is a thing like a prison sentence is or like%0a> 1:48:10%0a> a fine both of those are reversible like you can get out of person again you can get the money from the fines%0a> 1:48:17%0a> back you can get your life back like doing a punishment that's in Reverse in Reverse it is a problem in itself%0a> 1:48:25%0a> oh no I I don't see a [ __ ] problem with that likelike that [ __ ] would who did that measuring in Sweden like he%0a> 1:48:32%0a> [ __ ] killed all I think it was Sweden all records [ __ ] oh yeah yeah like%0a> 1:48:37%0a> like that [ __ ] guy right he [ __ ] killed a bunch of [ __ ] kids like he%0a> 1:48:43%0a> killed a bunch of kids he took their life without their [ __ ] consent well%0a> 1:48:50%0a> that's also [ __ ] be reversible [ __ ] that guy seriously I do not see a%0a> 1:48:56%0a> problem we'll say shouldn't have look there are too many people and it is%0a> 1:49:02%0a> actually quite important important thing yeah that that we come them I hope I do%0a> 1:49:09%0a> not out to be not using it as a revenge I'd really prone with that because if we use his ass as like a human trial he%0a> 1:49:18%0a> killed a bunch of kids now he gets the consequence with it which is guess Roger now lab monkey enjoy your stay%0a> 1:49:26%0a> well it so so that was actually a point that was brought up during the trial%0a> 1:49:31%0a> like saying like you're not you're not the person that gets to decide for the%0a> 1:49:37%0a> society how we should he just he and I also want to really fight for those kids%0a> 1:49:42%0a> to die that's right also and I think that's the far greater punishment for him would have been to look inside the%0a> 1:49:48%0a> mental asylum yeah so I think I think he wanted to be seen as fully responsible%0a> 1:49:55%0a> for what he did and yeah there was an argument in the court whether we were he was mentally insane yeah if there's a%0a> 1:50:01%0a> better lesson that he wants aalam yeah he refused to accept any any accusations%0a> 1:50:07%0a> of him being mentally unstable he was mentally sane while the game himself%0a> 1:50:12%0a> said yeah but but her so he himself saying that he is mentally as stable%0a> 1:50:19%0a> doesn't really qualify as an argument yeah no no no I'm just like that my question that the problem with insane%0a> 1:50:25%0a> people they don't know that they're insane well the point the point being was he wouldn't accept that as a line of%0a> 1:50:30%0a> defense from his from his lawyer great so but alright but but but what what%0a> 1:50:36%0a> what I didn't get to finish was saying that you also got to view it from from%0a> 1:50:41%0a> like a third third-party perspective so what what honestly our worst punishment%0a> 1:50:48%0a> like let's say let's say you um you plan to do something and let's say you don't%0a> 1:50:54%0a> really care much about your life anyway right because a lot of these other people that that I do these kind of%0a> 1:51:01%0a> things don't value life in the same sense that most people do now what then%0a> 1:51:07%0a> is the greatest punishment that you robbed someone from all their freedom%0a> 1:51:12%0a> and essentially force them to live out their life or just end it and it's also%0a> 1:51:22%0a> the same for someone that's watching them what'swhat's honestly worse watching%0a> 1:51:28%0a> someone rot away or someone ceasing to exist and you can now use them as a symbol so it's like it's there's a lot%0a> 1:51:38%0a> of nuances to this well I I'm a simple person I personally think who a person%0a> 1:51:46%0a> who does that type of [ __ ] does not [ __ ] deserve to bleed my [ __ ] air my initial my initial reaction was yes%0a> 1:51:54%0a> just like why didn't they just [ __ ] shoot him on the island because that's%0a> 1:52:00%0a> the point well yeah I'm also doing it an immediate danger to the police officers anymore they can't they kind of also%0a> 1:52:07%0a> also why shooting him was mean like a good point they didn't know if he was%0a> 1:52:13%0a> acting alone or not yeah exactly my goodness you always know what's going%0a> 1:52:19%0a> on but it's so easy right to have the initial reaction of just just just kill%0a> 1:52:24%0a> the follows yeah but but yeah like as%0a> 1:52:29%0a> time is going gone on I'm now in the camp of just just just keep him just%0a> 1:52:36%0a> keep it keep him like an old rag let rot what is his present sentence exactly so I think that something is it said one%0a> 1:52:43%0a> day so in in origin' is called a footballing which essentially means that%0a> 1:52:49%0a> he has a sentence of 21 years and he has a minimum period of I believe it's 15%0a> 1:52:54%0a> years before is even eligible to talk about a reduced sentence we just wanna%0a> 1:53:01%0a> as the same system in Germany when yeah actually whether you have at least 15%0a> 1:53:07%0a> years and in especially hard cases at least 25 years listen to this [ __ ]%0a> 1:53:14%0a> [ __ ] that [ __ ] killed a bunch of photos my girl Maria Marie I'm not no no%0a> 1:53:20%0a> it doesn't get real at the point if I don't know I I didn't get to finish so the word for balling means that when%0a> 1:53:28%0a> like the minimum time is spent because a person here isn't a full calendar year right so when the minimum time is spent%0a> 1:53:36%0a> he now has to sit in front of essentially a new jury which is which%0a> 1:53:42%0a> consists of like prison personnel lawyers psychiatrists doctors and and so%0a> 1:53:52%0a> on and they need to evaluate the the quote-unquote candidate or inmate if he%0a> 1:53:58%0a> is eligible for release and if they deem not eligible he now has to serve a new%0a> 1:54:05%0a> sentence of five years and after five years this process repeats and it can repeat at invision yes so he can sit and%0a> 1:54:14%0a> most likely will sit for the revolts like he always join a chat he has of%0a> 1:54:19%0a> getting out if once he gets all and gets too sick to happy in the prison and even then he%0a> 1:54:27%0a> will probably be in some kind of special institution yes basically that after 25%0a> 1:54:35%0a> years as you've served you will get into another kind of prison which is not as strict as the other one and by the way%0a> 1:54:43%0a> the word for that is also quite close to the Norwegian word it's called survival if you probably same Danish for buying%0a> 1:54:50%0a> yeah it's probably the exact same word we have traumatic head coaches unite yes%0a> 1:54:57%0a> we call it a difference here in Allen's what we have to say well Dutch doesn't%0a> 1:55:03%0a> count because Dutch are weird do you back the Linguistics it was personally%0a> 1:55:10%0a> no [ __ ] did guide you just use a measure as a guinea pig [ __ ] talking no yeah%0a> 1:55:16%0a> right right after the case I would have agreed with you I no longer do no [ __ ] I%0a> 1:55:23%0a> do like it means that the death penalty in German is off the table because of the Constitution literally the first%0a> 1:55:30%0a> article in our Constitution says that human dignity cannot be taken away from somebody oh you know you know the first%0a> 1:55:38%0a> so I I have to lock this up again but I'm pretty sure I'm correct in saying yeah I'm looking off the range because%0a> 1:55:44%0a> seriously because it first it's I'm pretty sure the first the first point on%0a> 1:55:50%0a> ours is that the king is exempt from all other laws what uh what the [ __ ] well%0a> 1:55:57%0a> yeah so it is it is actually written in our laws and or Constitution that the%0a> 1:56:04%0a> king is exempted from all laws so essentially the king I mean obviously%0a> 1:56:09%0a> that would be overthrown if yeah if the King decided to go on like a murderous%0a> 1:56:15%0a> rampage in the capital that would obviously be changed but it would be%0a> 1:56:20%0a> changed after the fact here our King%0a> 1:56:26%0a> does not have that freedom look if he [ __ ] would do something like that%0a> 1:56:31%0a> he'll [ __ ] burn yes first german article as human%0a> 1:56:38%0a> dignity shall be inviolable to respect I'll copy the duty of all state authority the first one in ours is%0a> 1:56:45%0a> pretty simple if they do just oh this this constitution yeah it applies in the%0a> 1:56:51%0a> Kingdom of Denmark with a little sexual way to start out well here if he if he%0a> 1:56:57%0a> tries that [ __ ] it he's done for like he will be roasting well not roasting but%0a> 1:57:03%0a> chilling in prison for a long [ __ ] time yeah how high is the prison sentence in the Netherlands same exactly%0a> 1:57:12%0a> the same so at least about 20 years plus prolong well actually if you are%0a> 1:57:19%0a> convicted of murder there's a good chance you will be walking in 3 14 years%0a> 1:57:26%0a> yep see sighs where do I find these laws written in normal Norwegian holy [ __ ]%0a> 1:57:32%0a> this is written in the old girl ha ha ha ha you don't the troubles of having%0a> 1:57:39%0a> reformed your language so you know micro you might actually be able to read this%0a> 1:57:45%0a> better than I do because it's almost it's almost Danish yeah it's let's see%0a> 1:57:52%0a> oh I want to see this as well to see if I can translate it I'm not sure laughs%0a> 1:58:02%0a> arias follow follow follow follow us lots of [ __ ] for the full of stuff%0a> 1:58:08%0a> that it means to to to promise or to do as your word like you're not here%0a> 1:58:16%0a> because have a hell is a promise we'll%0a> 1:58:22%0a> have we call that Bluff here in the Netherlands all right I can't read%0a> 1:58:28%0a> anything of that I can I can sort of clean the the meaning out of it%0a> 1:58:35%0a> follow ever Hama Marcus Erica who would manage some wonderful overflow for Yeldon Nohant Ilhan and lovely%0a> 1:58:41%0a> oscilloscopes like ha ha ha Niki bacala Karakum like it's just ok the personal climate the%0a> 1:58:49%0a> the purse the personal make something like a promise has the power to I think%0a> 1:58:59%0a> it's the person that he has the power to decide when the promises to be repaid or%0a> 1:59:07%0a> without yeah yeah yeah it's where it's worded so [ __ ] we're doing fingers%0a> 1:59:14%0a> actually it's a like it's alone yeah the stepped it's that it's just like%0a> 1:59:23%0a> please I wanted in actual Norwegian it's the own fault for [ __ ] if a [ __ ]%0a> 1:59:30%0a> [ __ ] fall like reforming your language is also it's also like it%0a> 1:59:38%0a> contrary to so this is funny I brought this up before because you know how they%0a> 1:59:43%0a> say that yet the u.s. is a Christian country right which it were seriously its currently not Norway is by law so%0a> 1:59:51%0a> it's been like yeah I'm not sure about Germany right now because for some%0a> 1:59:56%0a> reason we still have like the Christian holidays are still national holidays%0a> 2:00:02%0a> yeah which I'm completely against no Germany is not it's not completely%0a> 2:00:07%0a> secular that's the problem for example it states that religious teaching in%0a> 2:00:13%0a> schools is by definition okay but the problem is so that in most times%0a> 2:00:21%0a> only Christian education is available yeah but I'm pretty sure the German%0a> 2:00:27%0a> constitution doesn't include the lines which isn't Evangelical Lutheran Church shall be the established Church of%0a> 2:00:32%0a> Denmark also should be supported by the state well it wouldn't have to line referring to Denmark obviously yeah but%0a> 2:00:40%0a> then no no I don't think there's something like that that states that the people so everyone it is a fun one the%0a> 2:00:47%0a> king or in this case the Queen's it really should say the monarch shall be%0a> 2:00:53%0a> she'll be a member of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in other words the%0a> 2:00:59%0a> is to have a specific religion yeah same here Qaeda which is kind of [ __ ] up%0a> 2:01:05%0a> yeah it's it's Lutheran here as well I think we get from Denmark we up yeah um%0a> 2:01:12%0a> it's just they they thought that Ben Martin like Denmark and Sweden have had%0a> 2:01:18%0a> a lot of war was and it's to mainly pin about the notary of all over yeah if who%0a> 2:01:25%0a> wrote lowly we we've all pretty much always been the bottom [ __ ] well that's%0a> 2:01:30%0a> pretty obvious why because until you basically unser you start oil you have been if you were a fairly poor country%0a> 2:01:37%0a> which yeah that's why so much of Norwegian where Christine is based on them like it's farmers food%0a> 2:01:44%0a> she is promised to keep it again cow essentially all of it and fish and fish%0a> 2:01:50%0a> oh yeah yeah oh so you were so lucky or didn't take the bet because I actually found that dish based on lying mixed%0a> 2:01:58%0a> with heart oh god you know change in%0a> 2:02:05%0a> terms of avaria name is always limited how about you [ __ ] people eat%0a> 2:02:10%0a> something normal like shallow cut something we saw out half of it I just%0a> 2:02:16%0a> this is pretty normal Oh which country was I think it was%0a> 2:02:22%0a> Denmark or Sweden or something with it a fermented herring [ __ ] brother LS that%0a> 2:02:28%0a> Sweden's I'm sorry so sorry yeah how about no like can you guys know%0a> 2:02:34%0a> that is suppose to like not taste that bad it's just as well as Oahu I just%0a> 2:02:40%0a> don't eat something that smells like and and also you need it like you need like you needed with raw onion like you read%0a> 2:02:47%0a> it with other things that will master taste and smell growing in the past%0a> 2:02:52%0a> hey I don't want to eat something just tastes like my mother's [ __ ] how do I know how I don't want to know but by the%0a> 2:03:01%0a> way I was wrong i found so 1814 is when norway as the country it is right now%0a> 2:03:06%0a> was fondling it's all over germany this the 17th of May%0a> 2:03:12%0a> is our national national day so it I was drawings at the first it's the fifth it%0a> 2:03:20%0a> says Congress personally Hagen Ikki lost his alarm clock s Antalya tempore legal hogs Ward which essentially means that%0a> 2:03:27%0a> you cannot touch the king as a person and all responsibility is by his own%0a> 2:03:32%0a> judgment um that's one of those things were like%0a> 2:03:37%0a> but yeah but it's like he went out and killed someone ya know he would get punished yeah he%0a> 2:03:44%0a> would get punished in that that law would be would be changed but if there a mechanism to punish him yes%0a> 2:03:51%0a> oh yeah thanks a lot you can also I think you can remove his royal guidance%0a> 2:03:58%0a> yeah but that's not another like [ __ ] bureaucracy hell I mean I mean%0a> 2:04:04%0a> technically you would always like ELISA in Denmark we could theoretically just like have a vote and change the%0a> 2:04:11%0a> constitution and like from one day like on a certain date life several like the%0a> 2:04:18%0a> Royals would stop the stopping roll and%0a> 2:04:24%0a> dude okay so out of the first ten laws as you say is the ten commandments right%0a> 2:04:30%0a> a law three four five six seven eight%0a> 2:04:39%0a> nine and ten including eleven twelve%0a> 2:04:45%0a> thirteen fourteen yeah okay so out of%0a> 2:04:50%0a> the first 15 law three to fourteen is%0a> 2:04:56%0a> all about the king yeah I'm just going to go ctrl F and%0a> 2:05:02%0a> just search King and see how many how many times are you like in almost every%0a> 2:05:07%0a> law yeah okay excluding the first one because that it says Kingdom but but so%0a> 2:05:14%0a> forty forty nine forty nine places in the same Constitution mentions King oh%0a> 2:05:21%0a> it's a hell of a lot more than that okay okay okay okay two of them also like to end up making%0a> 2:05:28%0a> but but many of them at least in the Norwegian one is it is essentially just like this does not apply for the king%0a> 2:05:37%0a> it's kind of weird that it's still Hector helling it's still like cleaning Li like I'm%0a> 2:05:44%0a> assuming by King here they mean monarch because otherwise all of these laws%0a> 2:05:49%0a> wouldn't apply because we don't have a king at the moment so our first law is%0a> 2:05:56%0a> actually Camilla Camilla got ripped asunder you diddly oh you having it again that's it feelings from an instant get all in%0a> 2:06:03%0a> Caracas which yeah means it's it's free independent unda visible and independent%0a> 2:06:10%0a> and the government will have a limited power and we'll have a monarchy that%0a> 2:06:17%0a> passes by blood essentially that's the first rule and then the second law is%0a> 2:06:23%0a> that that our expose our second so yes and this is the second is that our our%0a> 2:06:30%0a> foundation for values will be our Christian and humanitarian like Shaw%0a> 2:06:37%0a> pretty weird considering to do those two things are kind of actually exclusive if%0a> 2:06:43%0a> you go by guys without that guys I'm going to close the Hangout at least%0a> 2:06:49%0a> dreaming yeah we can discuss more if you want but there's no point in continuing%0a> 2:06:55%0a> doing alias and YouTube so for everybody who's still here thanks for watching see%0a> 2:07:00%0a> you soon hopefully or not it depends by%0a\ No newline at end of file%0a

Naturehacker writings [[https://www.naturehacker.org/search/label/Gold|#]].%0a> %0a294,2624c294%0a%3c My current theory of [[Lost Dutchman]] is he found a stash of [[jesuit]] gold [[https://youtu.be/RND-C83mliU|#]] and I think since the ore he was found with in a shoe box under his bed which matched no known earth ore when he died, the jesuits made the gold using perhaps a magnifying glass concentrating light to make gold from iron oxide and sand and sulfur.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!Naturehacker interview%0a%3c %0a%3c Naturehacker's other gold video's on youtube were deleted.%0a%3c %0a%3c https://youtu.be/VBNbxsbxsfg%0a%3c %0a%3c so it appears that we are online hello everybody and this would be a rather%0a%3c 0:08%0a%3c short hangout we agreed to do like 60 minutes or so and I have here with me an attacker who has made some really%0a%3c 0:14%0a%3c interesting claims about how to make gold from iron oxide since this kind of falls into my area of%0a%3c 0:20%0a%3c expertise I'm going to show him why it's wrong and without further ado hello%0a%3c 0:26%0a%3c nature hacker hello so um I think the best idea to do this is to give you some%0a%3c 0:33%0a%3c minutes like 10 minutes or so to present your case is that Alright for you yeah sounds good okay%0a%3c 0:40%0a%3c so then just begin tell me when you're finished all right so this all started%0a%3c 0:47%0a%3c um maybe a month ago when I was watching something on TV about um them finding%0a%3c 0:53%0a%3c gold in sewage so I was thinking huh this is interesting you know I don't really%0a%3c 0:59%0a%3c think that many people eat gold and you know plants aren't big gold%0a%3c 1:04%0a%3c concentrators necessary that we eat so saying well how does this happen and could it be possible that the gold is%0a%3c 1:11%0a%3c actually produced you know in our bodies or into it or something like that and%0a%3c 1:18%0a%3c then just got me thinking about maybe it's actually possible to make gold so I%0a%3c 1:23%0a%3c started doing a lot of research and so I kind of forgot about that you know per%0a%3c 1:28%0a%3c se I just started doing research on how gold is found in the earth you know is gold made in the earth how is gold made%0a%3c 1:35%0a%3c you know what the current theories are and everything and so I kind of forgot about the gold and - interesting for the%0a%3c 1:40%0a%3c moment and I started finding that gold is found in very specific conditions um%0a%3c 1:47%0a%3c you know it's basically always found with quartz it's basically always found%0a%3c 1:54%0a%3c with iron um you know it's basically always found with either sulfur or%0a%3c 1:59%0a%3c tellurium or so selenium I believe those types of elements that they're all in%0a%3c 2:06%0a%3c the same uh they're all in the same column of the periodic table um and you%0a%3c 2:12%0a%3c know it just got me thinking that one Wow this this is a very specific set of circumstances where gold%0a%3c 2:18%0a%3c is found um maybe gold is actually made with some of%0a%3c 2:24%0a%3c these as ingredients you know we've definitely heard of alchemy and things like that and that's typically thought%0a%3c 2:29%0a%3c to be mercury because mercury is very close to gold on the periodic table so we're like okay well if we can remove a%0a%3c 2:35%0a%3c proton I believe we can convert mercury in the gold so that's typically the top but um but you know I'm seeing these%0a%3c 2:43%0a%3c these elements like quartz or you know compounds like cords or an iron and and%0a%3c 2:52%0a%3c you know sulfur and things like that found together with gold all the time something well maybe maybe these are the%0a%3c 2:59%0a%3c things that gold could be made out of so um you know and looking at the theories you know a lot like the new theory is%0a%3c 3:06%0a%3c now that gold can only be made when neutron stars which are very rare thing%0a%3c 3:11%0a%3c neutron stars collide that's where all the gold comes from and that just seems very very unlikely to me that all the%0a%3c 3:18%0a%3c gold in the universe is from neutron stars colliding and you know obviously we have a lot of heavy elements so you%0a%3c 3:25%0a%3c know is neutron stars colliding the only way these heavy elements are created I don't think so so um you know doing all%0a%3c 3:34%0a%3c that research and um and then finding it's been coming up with an idea of okay%0a%3c 3:39%0a%3c maybe gold is created from I don't know how I came up with this idea but the%0a%3c 3:45%0a%3c idea was that electricity could create it and that these very strong so hydro%0a%3c 3:52%0a%3c h2s hydrogen sulfide and h2 te hydrogen%0a%3c 3:58%0a%3c Telluride arm come up in earthquakes and we also know that gold is really found%0a%3c 4:04%0a%3c around earthquake zones you know like California has really rich gold positive if there's a lot of earthquakes there it's just a common%0a%3c 4:11%0a%3c fact that you know gold is found in earthquake areas so one other thing%0a%3c 4:16%0a%3c that's found a lot in earth cake boy areas is hydrogen sulfide gas you know we sometimes even hydrogen telluride gas%0a%3c 4:22%0a%3c um and that you know obviously these are the things that create sulphide minerals tell Euler%0a%3c 4:30%0a%3c telluride minerals um so the thought is that okay let's say that there's some%0a%3c 4:36%0a%3c iron oxide trapped in quartz which is very common to happen um then this in an%0a%3c 4:43%0a%3c earthquake hydrogen sulfide gas would rush by this gas is a strong reducing%0a%3c 4:48%0a%3c agent which is like an electron donor and also especially when it reacts with%0a%3c 4:54%0a%3c sodium you know in the form of like sodium hydroxide or sodium oxide or%0a%3c 4:59%0a%3c something like that um it will create HS or SH which is a%0a%3c 5:05%0a%3c very very strong reducing agent so I'm like well if we have a lot of this gas rushing by this quartz and the quartz%0a%3c 5:11%0a%3c could have a lot of sodium in it especially in California the course has a lot of sodium in it we can create a%0a%3c 5:17%0a%3c very strong electric charge in the quartz which would transfer to the%0a%3c 5:23%0a%3c hematite the iron oxide inside the quartz and hopefully convert it into gold so that was the thought and then um%0a%3c 5:31%0a%3c so the thought is basically that the self eyes or Telluride is acting as a reducing agent to convert iron into gold%0a%3c 5:40%0a%3c now the question was well how exactly would that happen arm how exactly would%0a%3c 5:46%0a%3c the gold you know turning into or to start the iron turn into gold and why would it have to be an oxide of iron%0a%3c 5:52%0a%3c because because we see a lot of a lot of gold miners will say the redder the better the redder the better which means%0a%3c 5:59%0a%3c that the more hematite in the quartz the better you know the better it is as an%0a%3c 6:05%0a%3c order for gold so you know the thought would be that hematite is needed in order for this process to create gold%0a%3c 6:12%0a%3c and so one of the mechanisms I came up with that could explain it would be oxygen vacancies in the iron oxide%0a%3c 6:19%0a%3c structure so um when you have a strongly positive charge um you create austen%0a%3c 6:28%0a%3c vacancies and then these vacancies will migrate to a strong negative charge and%0a%3c 6:34%0a%3c then when they're there I'm guessing that electrons can fill the vacancies%0a%3c 6:40%0a%3c and I'm guessing that what this can do is create a collapse of the structure of iron oxide and it turns out I did the%0a%3c 6:48%0a%3c math that iron 55 which is I guess you can say a rare isotope of iron but it's%0a%3c 6:55%0a%3c something that's created by the very common when very common isotopes of iron%0a%3c 7:01%0a%3c like 54 and 56 are hit with neutron radiation they turn in 55 very strangely%0a%3c 7:07%0a%3c iron 56 go to 57 then decays the 55 iron%0a%3c 7:13%0a%3c 54 games to iron 55 so radiation which is also radiation is also found in%0a%3c 7:19%0a%3c earthquakes a lot so radiation can cause iron to turn in iron 55 and if you take%0a%3c 7:25%0a%3c three iron 55 which is the structure of iron oxide you know to a good degree the%0a%3c 7:31%0a%3c structure of iron oxide you take three of those and two oxygens the theory is that that vacancy will cause an%0a%3c 7:39%0a%3c implosion and those three atoms will combine into gold and they add up to%0a%3c 7:45%0a%3c create the molecular weight of gold now once you know at some point I was I thought back to the original idea of the%0a%3c 7:52%0a%3c you know gold in sewage and I realized that there's a lot of hydrogen sulfide in sewage something maybe maybe the gold%0a%3c 8:00%0a%3c is actually being made in sewage and it's from the hydrogen sulfide producing microbes that are actually doing so%0a%3c 8:08%0a%3c anyway that that's pretty much my thought process on it so yeah okay so my%0a%3c 8:14%0a%3c suggestion is Oh first of all I can get my echo can you maybe turn your speaker's little more silent yeah yeah%0a%3c 8:21%0a%3c turn you down yeah all right so I could%0a%3c 8:28%0a%3c kill myself what's annoying okay hold on one second let me assure you as well%0a%3c 8:53%0a%3c me there yeah yeah no better okay so my suggestion is that we go through the%0a%3c 9:01%0a%3c list of the claims that you've made and discuss every single one of them if we mind the time for everyone everything so%0a%3c 9:09%0a%3c and just started with the point that gold is found in sewage and therefore it should somehow be produced in sewage%0a%3c 9:16%0a%3c that is a non sequitur just because the gold is there doesn't mean that is that it is produced where for example yeah%0a%3c 9:23%0a%3c gold goes for example could end up in switch for example with electronic trash%0a%3c 9:29%0a%3c because gold is widely used in electronic materials computers smartphones monitors your name at%0a%3c 9:35%0a%3c whatever when they would be going for dumps not necessarily see with you%0a%3c 9:40%0a%3c you know dumpsters were like trying to garbage would be yeah mainly but first%0a%3c 9:46%0a%3c of all I don't know the amount of gold that you're claiming is fallen sewage so if it's only trace material then well%0a%3c 9:52%0a%3c what they find is it's a low-level gold mine is what they call it like the amount of gold in sewages would be%0a%3c 9:58%0a%3c considered a gold mine alleged doing all the concentrations approximately you can%0a%3c 10:05%0a%3c google it just Google like gold and sewage there's been a lot of articles on stuff okay%0a%3c 10:11%0a%3c so again I said I don't think that just%0a%3c 10:18%0a%3c because the gold is found in there that that doesn't mean that it's produced there so I mean you actually I Joe Lopez%0a%3c 10:24%0a%3c was generally thinking all right so then then we just skip that or do you want to elaborate more on that point um yeah I%0a%3c 10:33%0a%3c mean that was basically just what got me thinking about it it didn't quite make sense to me that there would necessarily%0a%3c 10:39%0a%3c be like old sewage that's why I thought that would that's one one dot you know%0a%3c 10:44%0a%3c to connect I would think but not necessarily proof in and of itself obviously all right%0a%3c 10:49%0a%3c and then so you saw your main claim is that there's a reaction that you can perform which involves%0a%3c 10:55%0a%3c the hydrogen sulfide the quartz crystal plus the iron oxide and the main problem%0a%3c 11:02%0a%3c that I have with it is that what this comes down to is that the chemical%0a%3c 11:09%0a%3c environment of the iron atoms and the oxygen atoms somehow influences the%0a%3c 11:16%0a%3c reactions of the nuclei themselves and right but the problem is that if that%0a%3c 11:23%0a%3c were the case if the chemical environment of substances would influence the reactions of the nuclei%0a%3c 11:31%0a%3c then we would already be able to use this properties to get rid of a nuclear%0a%3c 11:39%0a%3c waste for example God would be able to manipulate the nuclear base in a%0a%3c 11:44%0a%3c chemical way and increase or decrease the amount of radiation emitted by it%0a%3c 11:51%0a%3c and that has never been observed so that's actually quite a bold claim to%0a%3c 11:56%0a%3c make and which you actually have to really provide some hard evidence for and I don't see a yet well the mechanism%0a%3c 12:04%0a%3c arm the summer established mechanism of%0a%3c 12:10%0a%3c kind of chemically induced nuclear reactions would be the creation of neutrons from protons and electrons yeah%0a%3c 12:18%0a%3c but you can't do that chemically that's not a chemical reaction but chemists reduce that is only the electrons around%0a%3c 12:24%0a%3c the nuclei and for for a chemist the nucleus itself is completely irrelevant it could be a single particle with a%0a%3c 12:30%0a%3c defiant charge that's not that's not a chemical reaction that's nuclear physical reaction but that was just a%0a%3c 12:37%0a%3c terminology thing whatever you would want to call it I mean you know India is that's that's not only me that's the%0a%3c 12:44%0a%3c scientific consensus calling it so the edges are cut okay well there is you%0a%3c 12:51%0a%3c know field called nuclear chemistry yeah by Newton yeah nuclear chemistry deals with the chemistry of radioactive%0a%3c 12:57%0a%3c materials for example how to separate different fission reactions in reactors%0a%3c 13:03%0a%3c or how to separate so the whole field of chemistry is just separation of%0a%3c 13:08%0a%3c materials no that's the difference brain nuclear chemistry tomato is react reactions%0a%3c 13:15%0a%3c could involve an electron and a proton there'll be a reaction know what%0a%3c 13:21%0a%3c chemistry deals with is how the electrons behaves yeah how the electrons%0a%3c 13:28%0a%3c themself pays when the nuclei of the of the atoms are completely relevant for chemistry whenever you have a direct%0a%3c 13:34%0a%3c reaction such as for example the problem you know the reaction to start medalist determines how many electrons you can%0a%3c 13:40%0a%3c have which is not sure but they don't they don't react directly everything%0a%3c 13:47%0a%3c that happens there is a detraction electric electric macam electrostatic%0a%3c 13:53%0a%3c attraction between the two particles but there's no direct reaction between the for example nuclear reactions other ones%0a%3c 14:01%0a%3c that the nuclei react themselves the chemistry there are no nuclei that react the nuclei don't do anything there can%0a%3c 14:08%0a%3c be seen a standard conventional chemistry sure but I mean if you want to define chemistry is that which with that%0a%3c 14:14%0a%3c which is not nucular than fine it's it's physics then but I mean yeah I don't really let that that's%0a%3c 14:21%0a%3c my point because in India videos you're mixed up nuclear chemistry and nuclear reactions%0a%3c 14:27%0a%3c that's a different thing well you know the thought is um cold%0a%3c 14:32%0a%3c fusion you know I don't necessarily want to open up a whole bag can of worms a cold fusion but cold fusion would be%0a%3c 14:38%0a%3c like chemical nuclear reactions whereas hot fusion would be like ah you know%0a%3c 14:44%0a%3c physics high temperature physics but you know I I don't know if it how much it matters what the terminology we use but%0a%3c 14:50%0a%3c it ends up as physics anyways um regarding cold fusion what basically%0a%3c 14:56%0a%3c happens is that at least that was a claim that the chemical environment of I think it was metal hydrides that would%0a%3c 15:02%0a%3c influence how words would induce student reactions the point is that this%0a%3c 15:07%0a%3c is show has been shown to be not working so well is that still under debate I%0a%3c 15:13%0a%3c mean there's definitely a lot of scientists there's been one whistleblower from MIT who said that their claim that they disproved it was%0a%3c 15:20%0a%3c actually false that you know they actually did have some evidences supported that was covered up so there's%0a%3c 15:27%0a%3c an ongoing discussion well there was a I think it all started in the ninth at%0a%3c 15:32%0a%3c Indian late 80s and 90s when the last paper published claiming that cold%0a%3c 15:38%0a%3c fusion would work which was later shown by other work groups that's as original experiment wasn't%0a%3c 15:45%0a%3c repeatable and the article was eventually retracted so that it's very weird agreement of getting it also%0a%3c 15:52%0a%3c happen there definitely have groups that have had a positive you know I have a%0a%3c 15:57%0a%3c positive supporting evidence and you can look that up online there's there's been a 60 Minutes interview with people with%0a%3c 16:05%0a%3c like real scientists who were shown the evidence of you know an Israeli company who's claiming difficult fusion and they%0a%3c 16:11%0a%3c worried about it actually publish it there's no submitting that they can do interviews as long as they want when%0a%3c 16:17%0a%3c they don't publish it and it's practically useless whatever they say it's useless unless it's published%0a%3c 16:23%0a%3c there's a lot of published data of cold fusion on your show on Ixtapa it can%0a%3c 16:29%0a%3c appear with scientific drama sure yeah I have examples I don't know if you how you want me to show here and we have the%0a%3c 16:37%0a%3c link to the to the article um yeah I mean I could find something here let's%0a%3c 16:44%0a%3c see I think the claim would be I by the%0a%3c 16:51%0a%3c writer had put your claim conspiracies of the conspiracy going on to come up cold fusion%0a%3c 16:56%0a%3c because that's the impression I'm getting I could definitely see that could definitely be a possibility the%0a%3c 17:02%0a%3c reason the motive would be because the people performing hot fusion are getting%0a%3c 17:08%0a%3c billions of dollars in funding from the government and if there's a cold easier%0a%3c 17:13%0a%3c way to do it then that revenue would be in jeopardy so I could definitely see that some institutions or professors%0a%3c 17:20%0a%3c would want to stop research into cold fusion which they effectively did yeah but but the question is the funding%0a%3c 17:27%0a%3c doesn't and to do it so the most part in the pockets of the scientists were%0a%3c 17:33%0a%3c committed ends in the equipment I I don't smell a Lurie is it yeah we%0a%3c 17:39%0a%3c join another ant but the most part directly goes into the materials needed look Sonia reacted itself for example%0a%3c 17:47%0a%3c when when talking about the Austral the ITER in southern France that thing%0a%3c 17:55%0a%3c literally costs billions that the magnetic coils alone cost billions great%0a%3c 18:01%0a%3c right those are the celery stem cells are rather small small part of the money that is needed right and you know I've%0a%3c 18:07%0a%3c worked in science and a big part of getting grants and stuff is to to%0a%3c 18:13%0a%3c basically you have to prove to the agency that this is the only way that you can do the research like I worked in%0a%3c 18:19%0a%3c animal research and we use rats and we had to prove that we couldn't do that%0a%3c 18:24%0a%3c research in a lower organism so you know if cold fusion is a possibility of%0a%3c 18:30%0a%3c potential potentiality then it would be much more difficult for them to justify the need for such expensive equipment%0a%3c 18:37%0a%3c when something cheaper and easier to be done so I could see how it could be a conspiracy to cover it up yeah yeah all%0a%3c 18:44%0a%3c right I just wanted to have to clear it up first okay so could you please describe the%0a%3c 18:52%0a%3c experiment that you're planning to do on the mechanics what kind of reactor you're going to use what sort of it%0a%3c 19:01%0a%3c first of all how I go you're going to show that the results that maybe you%0a%3c 19:07%0a%3c think you'll get gold as a result how do you prove it ma'am right what amount of%0a%3c 19:13%0a%3c starting material to use etc well um ie%0a%3c 19:18%0a%3c is what I would like to do is you know obviously have an experiment send a%0a%3c 19:25%0a%3c sample of pre experiment to get analyzed for gold send an experiment post you%0a%3c 19:30%0a%3c know a sample post experiment to get analyzed see if there's any extra gold in it um it just turns out difficult to%0a%3c 19:36%0a%3c do that what I've been trying to do lately is actually extract the gold on my own but you know it's obviously%0a%3c 19:42%0a%3c pretty crude just do an acid extraction and a precipitation with smv or oxalic acid I haven't gotten any%0a%3c 19:49%0a%3c old and I mean if there's very small mountains unlike that would get recover any yeah i think i think the best the%0a%3c 19:56%0a%3c best way you can actually test for goal in this case even for small amounts to use a mass spectrometer right but that%0a%3c 20:02%0a%3c will directly show you the goals even the different isotopes if you don't get it%0a%3c 20:08%0a%3c yeah right so yeah right quite easy way to do it once I feel like I have an%0a%3c 20:14%0a%3c experiment as a lot of potential then I will definitely try to submit something%0a%3c 20:19%0a%3c from mass spectrometry but what I'm trying to do right now I got this little radiation detector it's gamma and%0a%3c 20:26%0a%3c Neutron it's a radiation so I'm trying%0a%3c 20:33%0a%3c to see if like any of my experiments I can get any noticeable radiation coming%0a%3c 20:38%0a%3c off of it if I notice a lot of radiation then that would be promising for me that maybe something's working and then I%0a%3c 20:45%0a%3c would you know benefit from getting it analyzed so you know my present%0a%3c 20:51%0a%3c experiments have just been doing electrolysis kind of like the you know somewhat similar to the cold fusion%0a%3c 20:57%0a%3c method then what tessick electrolysis to do with the other experiment that they proposed what's the connection%0a%3c 21:04%0a%3c um well okay yeah I should I explain the other experiment but the thought is that%0a%3c 21:09%0a%3c electi no electricity can create gold from iron oxide so if we take the two%0a%3c 21:16%0a%3c iron electrodes one it's a positive or it's got a lot of rust accumulating iron%0a%3c 21:21%0a%3c oxide accumulating then switch to polarity and then get that electrode to%0a%3c 21:27%0a%3c be negative where electrons are going to interact with that rust that maybe we could get some gold I thought I was%0a%3c 21:34%0a%3c getting radiation coming off of it but with this meter I'm not getting in radiation so I don't think it's very promising experiment I mean what what%0a%3c 21:41%0a%3c you're proposing is practically an electrochemical cell so that when you%0a%3c 21:46%0a%3c have iron oxides electrode and you will apply a negative potential you would%0a%3c 21:53%0a%3c simply end up with iron in the best case but this is a very own processing and%0a%3c 21:59%0a%3c working nonsense I think the eighteen hundreds with the first batteries made by Volta right so yeah yeah wanted%0a%3c 22:08%0a%3c desperately he's doing this kind of stuff that has never been shown anything that would indicate that there would be%0a%3c 22:14%0a%3c gold forming because you can really look at the electrochemical potential of iron to oxide and iron three oxide right what%0a%3c 22:22%0a%3c the standard hydrogen electrode and there's no mentioning of anything ever these are unknown processes and you%0a%3c 22:27%0a%3c claim that there's something wrong with them or there's something that no I mean I'll come back already how about them I'm not saying this would%0a%3c 22:34%0a%3c be the major reaction I you know I know chemistry to definitely that would be the major reaction is just reduction of%0a%3c 22:41%0a%3c iron oxide but there are things called oxygen vacancies that can form in these structures so it is possible that we%0a%3c 22:48%0a%3c could get oxygen vacancies and then fill that vacancy with an electron it would be very small part of the reaction are%0a%3c 22:55%0a%3c you claiming that you can incite the iron oxide crust you can fill vacancies were usually ions would be with%0a%3c 23:01%0a%3c electrons there's the possibility that do you have any evidence for that%0a%3c 23:07%0a%3c because as far as I'm at I'm aware that this has never been shown to be the case%0a%3c 23:13%0a%3c except for metal maybe metal hydrides because they tend to be higher at the head a little bit Lee mm-hmm transition%0a%3c 23:21%0a%3c metal hydrides 10 tend to do something similar okay you know I I can't think of%0a%3c 23:27%0a%3c specific but I mean you know this is all stuff that I researched finding support in the research so I believe that it is%0a%3c 23:32%0a%3c possible for electrons to linky I think I read that somewhere but everywhere I don't know about so how much get if you%0a%3c 23:39%0a%3c treated in many of published signs or maybe yeah yeah exactly I always I'm always reading in published%0a%3c 23:47%0a%3c science but yeah I might marry my up you know I'm trying to verifying I'm trying to verify my theory as I go so not a%0a%3c 23:52%0a%3c writer act but yeah just out of curiosity have ready to let them learn%0a%3c 23:58%0a%3c chemistry what's wrong diversity from%0a%3c 24:03%0a%3c University all right so what kind of to the end reach where to go for biology or%0a%3c 24:09%0a%3c or chemistry itself um well I don't really want to give specifics but you%0a%3c 24:14%0a%3c know I did take upto analytical chemistry so the only thing I didn't take I believe this%0a%3c 24:20%0a%3c physical gum okay so um let me go back%0a%3c 24:26%0a%3c to my list of claims claims that you made Yeah right and you're claiming that%0a%3c 24:32%0a%3c these reactions produce angles are happening practically right now are you%0a%3c 24:37%0a%3c aren't you well that's the thought is it's not necessarily about me making%0a%3c 24:43%0a%3c gold as far as the claims and making claims of making is the Jeep theory I'm presenting a theory I know you're%0a%3c 24:50%0a%3c protecting a hypothesis no I'm not presenting hypothesis and the fastest%0a%3c 24:55%0a%3c the experiment has not been done know about the theory is when if there is a%0a%3c 25:01%0a%3c thought construct that that explains the the difference relation that the science%0a%3c 25:08%0a%3c practically but that has been already confirmed every claim that you've already made has has not that makes it a%0a%3c 25:14%0a%3c hypothesis not a theory well that we've been talking about these things but in general what I'm presenting is that my%0a%3c 25:21%0a%3c theory is that gold is made in this certain way okay and I can talk more%0a%3c 25:26%0a%3c about that the geology of it but in the African my question I mean when you say%0a%3c 25:31%0a%3c that as you said that gold is deposited%0a%3c 25:37%0a%3c in for example earthquake area does that aren't you claiming that this process of%0a%3c 25:43%0a%3c the gold formation is happening right now well I has it happened some time ago and it has stopped for some reason I would%0a%3c 25:50%0a%3c think that yes it is happening right now and all right you know this yeah%0a%3c 25:55%0a%3c basically so yep Joe you're Frost well%0a%3c 26:01%0a%3c basically what I would I feel like I'm trying to present at least in my first video and things is that I'm creating a%0a%3c 26:07%0a%3c theory of how gold is made based on the geology so I feel like my theory explains the geology at least as good if%0a%3c 26:15%0a%3c not better than the current theory of how gold is formed in the earth based on%0a%3c 26:22%0a%3c the geology of how it's found so yeah it's based on the geology and then I'm trying to dig deeper and get to%0a%3c 26:29%0a%3c the chemistry or physics at how it's actually happening alright so um you%0a%3c 26:34%0a%3c claimed that iron 55 would be needed for the reaction right right right if that%0a%3c 26:41%0a%3c were the case wouldn't you then expect iron 55 to be at least in found traces%0a%3c 26:49%0a%3c at relatively fresh coal deposits because iron 55 has a half-life of about%0a%3c 26:54%0a%3c two years that makes it really rare even%0a%3c 27:00%0a%3c if there would be some sort of neutron radiation coming in which I don't think is the case there is you have to have%0a%3c 27:07%0a%3c evidence of iron 55 occurring in nature in the in the proximity of coal deposits%0a%3c 27:12%0a%3c I don't have any other direct evidence that I don't know whether or not I would%0a%3c 27:17%0a%3c predict them maybe one evidence for example be the abundance of the decay%0a%3c 27:24%0a%3c product of iron 55-foot which i think is manganese 55 inside iron crisper iron%0a%3c 27:32%0a%3c oxide crystals that are found close to gold deposits sure yeah yeah this is the%0a%3c 27:41%0a%3c problem with manganese 55 is that it's the only stable isotope of manganese so whenever you have manganese you will%0a%3c 27:47%0a%3c have manganese 55 so you really can't do any isotopic analysis or not booking it%0a%3c 27:52%0a%3c maybe if there's a relative extra abundance of 55 and relation the other%0a%3c 27:57%0a%3c isotopes that could be annoying so too long hot all right the problem is trivia%0a%3c 28:03%0a%3c um well I mean I've been able to make a bunch of predictions and verify them in%0a%3c 28:08%0a%3c the science like for example if this is the case we would see a lot of mercury%0a%3c 28:13%0a%3c being created in the same process because if iron 56 I believe is used%0a%3c 28:20%0a%3c instead of 55 we would end up with mercury and it does turn out that mercury is one of the biggest%0a%3c 28:25%0a%3c contaminants in gold and that you know yes that is not that is not surprising I%0a%3c 28:31%0a%3c mean first of all mercury in its elemental form is a liquid so other methods such as the precious metals gold%0a%3c 28:37%0a%3c iridium platinum so on and so forth what tends to solve in mercury and then as%0a%3c 28:42%0a%3c actually vapor pressures even quite high at room temperature you would slowly get%0a%3c 28:48%0a%3c rid of the mercury so the position of that stuff is not unexpected at least in my opinion right right but just that%0a%3c 28:56%0a%3c plus all these other factors it's it does seem hard to explain that that gold%0a%3c 29:02%0a%3c would just be randomly found with quartz and iron and not really err I mean class%0a%3c 29:08%0a%3c is nothing but silicon dioxide it's more or less the most abundant substance on the surface of the planet%0a%3c 29:15%0a%3c okay well maybe your question oxygen is the most abundant element in the Earth's%0a%3c 29:22%0a%3c crust and I think silicon is either the second or the third one so they're a so that the probability that even that you%0a%3c 29:30%0a%3c find silicon dioxide also known as quartz in the proximity of co2 posit is high anyways and I don't see any any%0a%3c 29:36%0a%3c point how you can differentiate between a random occurrence and the two things%0a%3c 29:42%0a%3c being being connected well it is well-known though that like quartz%0a%3c 29:47%0a%3c deposits are definitely places to look for gold especially in conjunction with iron I mean you know it's not you%0a%3c 29:55%0a%3c wouldn't look for uh you know manganese in those conditions necessarily but if%0a%3c 30:01%0a%3c that is I mean it is well known and it's there's been a lot of theories as to why that is%0a%3c 30:06%0a%3c you know people saying that gold is found in the vapor phase of magma and that the grape of phase yeah I don't%0a%3c 30:15%0a%3c really do mean I'm ripe efface I mean it's a liquid listen - vapor phase well%0a%3c 30:21%0a%3c yeah I mean this is their theory this is the the mainstream theory of how gold is%0a%3c 30:26%0a%3c deposited where it is you know I think you're mixing something up there because I've never actually had to turn vapor%0a%3c 30:32%0a%3c phase in okay so um magma yeah well I mean just above the magma in the vapor I%0a%3c 30:39%0a%3c guess but there's that how it gets up into the nooks and crannies of the crystals with the iron is the quartz and%0a%3c 30:46%0a%3c the iron and things like that but all right so um an important question that I would%0a%3c 30:53%0a%3c really like to have an answer for us where do you think the energy comes from because you know that iron has the most%0a%3c 30:59%0a%3c data nucleus at all meaning that every nuclear reaction yielding atoms with%0a%3c 31:07%0a%3c high atomic numbers than 26 which is iron actually are endothermic so in the%0a%3c 31:14%0a%3c reaction causing where the energy come from right well the energy would come from a%0a%3c 31:19%0a%3c high voltage tracking the very high voltage they give you high voltage but in the original experiment that you%0a%3c 31:25%0a%3c proposed everything you did was what chemical right right go do this car that%0a%3c 31:31%0a%3c experiment at all or do you have done quietly why I do at the energy must come%0a%3c 31:38%0a%3c from electricity because it is doing what you expected to yield gold you%0a%3c 31:43%0a%3c would have to have the energy coming from a chemical process and remake the%0a%3c 31:49%0a%3c process is simply too weak to do that well necessarily I mean PV electricity%0a%3c 31:56%0a%3c can yield very high voltages and that's known to be in court so that you have%0a%3c 32:01%0a%3c got is that all that you can energy are two different things voltage usually do you know how much do%0a%3c 32:08%0a%3c you know how much energy it approximately needs for a nuke in%0a%3c 32:14%0a%3c nuclear reaction of that type because you can simply look at that you can%0a%3c 32:19%0a%3c simply look up the binding energies of different nuclei in the table but that%0a%3c 32:26%0a%3c is widely known and that's good I will definitely provide of everything and you%0a%3c 32:32%0a%3c will end up with a few mega electron volts maybe more per nuclei if a%0a%3c 32:39%0a%3c particle per Neutron or proton x-ray that's I think about ten or twenty%0a%3c 32:46%0a%3c thousand times more than it's needed for a chemical process right the chemical process simply can't do that well I mean%0a%3c 32:54%0a%3c depends on how you define a chemical process I mean this is the this is my theory of how the the voltage gets%0a%3c 33:01%0a%3c created and st the rushing by of the hydrogen sulfide gas basically charging up a quartz%0a%3c 33:09%0a%3c crystal yeah I understand your hypothesis but the problem is that the energy simply doesn't add up you can't%0a%3c 33:15%0a%3c do it at all you could get next develop it as you%0a%3c 33:20%0a%3c claimed it to be sparking metalic stoichiometrically correct that would be%0a%3c 33:27%0a%3c even God well I mean a crystal can build up charge we know that is like in its PV%0a%3c 33:34%0a%3c electricity so if there's a large volume of reduced strong reducing agent like%0a%3c 33:39%0a%3c hydrogen sulfide rushing by the crystal in theory it could charge crystal maybe to tens of%0a%3c 33:46%0a%3c thousands of volts I think is definitely conservative maybe a million I'm sure if are you sure that silicon%0a%3c 33:56%0a%3c dioxide crystals behave like kids or electrical components I'm not sure if%0a%3c 34:01%0a%3c that's okay yeah well corollaries look it up yeah TV electricity that's a good way to look it%0a%3c 34:07%0a%3c up and they yeah in PD electricity course crystals can generate very high voltages so it's I don't think it's%0a%3c 34:15%0a%3c beyond the realm of possibility yeah I highly doubt the tech that's the case so%0a%3c 34:21%0a%3c I'm basically in your reaction how you do you so what what you're doing is%0a%3c 34:28%0a%3c basically but what I think what will happen in your reaction is basically a redox process you will oxidize the%0a%3c 34:34%0a%3c hydrogen sulfide other HS minus ions 2h m dot H s 2 2 minus ions and you will%0a%3c 34:43%0a%3c reduce the iron 3 in your iron 3 oxide to iron 2 and therefore form FES 2 also%0a%3c 34:52%0a%3c known the spy-rays fourth cone and how would you stop that from happening%0a%3c 34:58%0a%3c well I I don't well how does that work from happening would be to segregate it%0a%3c 35:03%0a%3c so basically the quartz crystal is the iron oxide it inside the quartz crystal%0a%3c 35:09%0a%3c so it's not able to get self you know sulfide it all right so you're going to%0a%3c 35:14%0a%3c separate the two processes locally now but by having great stop is%0a%3c 35:23%0a%3c to compare that to a battery because what you do in a battery is you also have two different chemical processes%0a%3c 35:29%0a%3c that are separated locally and the charges that happen in the reaction reduction part of the reaction are%0a%3c 35:37%0a%3c transferred to the cable to the other to not not read on the side where the%0a%3c 35:45%0a%3c material oxidized you get the electrons and they will be transmitted through a cable or a wire to the side where the%0a%3c 35:50%0a%3c other material is reduced so the problem is batteries only work if you have a%0a%3c 35:58%0a%3c thing called an iron bridge right over well that yes all right then where is%0a%3c 36:05%0a%3c the equivalent of the iron bridge in your experiment well what this would be%0a%3c 36:11%0a%3c you know it's not an it it's not exactly bare it'd be more like a capacitor I would think I know because what what%0a%3c 36:18%0a%3c you're claiming is that all the time negative charges will be transmitted from one side to another won't be a%0a%3c 36:25%0a%3c capacitor if you if you claim that this this direction can be done all the time%0a%3c 36:32%0a%3c so in a continuous process right well the way I see it is let's say we have%0a%3c 36:37%0a%3c two quartz crystals and some iron oxide between it and we're charging up one%0a%3c 36:43%0a%3c side of the quartz crystal that that negative charge will create a positive%0a%3c 36:50%0a%3c charge and the other side of quartz crystal which is attaching to the dielectric which is the iron oxide and%0a%3c 36:56%0a%3c then the other side of the quartz crystal let's attach the other side of the iron oxide would develop a negative%0a%3c 37:02%0a%3c charge so we kind of get something like that it's more of a capacitor I would%0a%3c 37:07%0a%3c think in a battery I think you might be mixing up Crysta the polarization of crystals with a choke PS electricity%0a%3c 37:14%0a%3c dunno how a creates electricity is defined um but I don't know we mean by%0a%3c 37:20%0a%3c how it is defined yeah how it gets electricity defined when you are talking about voltage%0a%3c 37:25%0a%3c across C crystal not entirely that's one component missing%0a%3c 37:31%0a%3c what is that pressure well right for sure yeah yeah but do have any pressure%0a%3c 37:38%0a%3c acting on your crystal you know experimental but don't do it it's not exactly a piezoelectric thing but what%0a%3c 37:45%0a%3c I'm trying to say with the PD electric is that it is possible for a crystal to develop a charge differential from one%0a%3c 37:51%0a%3c side to the other so that's what I'm going for with the PD electricity that course can operate in a way where%0a%3c 37:57%0a%3c develops a strong charge across the crystal yeah but you wouldn't you need a%0a%3c 38:03%0a%3c constant current through the crystal because once as you claim the electrons on the one side what react with the%0a%3c 38:10%0a%3c nuclei of the iron and the oxygen that means that you would have to refuel it in quote marks around the other side%0a%3c 38:19%0a%3c with with the with hydrogen sulfide so it would need a large conductivity%0a%3c 38:26%0a%3c inside the crystals which you won't have I actually had this argument better not another guy was acting that silicon%0a%3c 38:33%0a%3c dioxide would be conductive and I said no it's it isn't it's not going to array but that's the weird part about it is it%0a%3c 38:40%0a%3c it can develop a charge across it so something's happening it's not a direct metallic type conductivity but there is%0a%3c 38:48%0a%3c ionic movement I think it's like and one's a logarithm the third eye on the%0a%3c 38:54%0a%3c other than silicon dioxide because silicon dioxide is compared to other two%0a%3c 39:01%0a%3c other kind of crystals it's the the bonds and inside the silicon dioxide I actual atomic bonds not not ionic forms%0a%3c 39:08%0a%3c and that makes the part for any type of charge movement well I don't know%0a%3c 39:15%0a%3c exactly but all I'm saying though is that PD the fact of PZ electricity in%0a%3c 39:20%0a%3c quartz shows that somehow charge can there can be a differential in charge from one side across to the other I%0a%3c 39:27%0a%3c don't know exactly chemically or physically how it happens but I know that you're a conductor for%0a%3c 39:33%0a%3c non-contact is what right right okay can you explain it to me because I think you have made a misconception about it%0a%3c 39:40%0a%3c well in a typical conductivity you have electrons that are loosely associated%0a%3c 39:46%0a%3c with atoms a kind of you know can move back and forth yeah right do you know%0a%3c 39:52%0a%3c driver little why they are able to move back and forth um I don't remember%0a%3c 39:59%0a%3c exactly it's because in the the crystalline the metal there are different energy states in which the electrons can be and depending on%0a%3c 40:06%0a%3c whether it's a conductor a nonconductor or semi conductor the energy difference between token so called valence band and%0a%3c 40:15%0a%3c the conduction band is different in valence band then and products they actually overlapping are very close to%0a%3c 40:21%0a%3c each other and the more non conducting it gets the further apart they are and%0a%3c 40:26%0a%3c basically the energy difference between those two is dependent on the chemical structure the structure of the different%0a%3c 40:32%0a%3c atoms for example when you have graphene for example which has a connected sp2%0a%3c 40:39%0a%3c hybridized system and you would have get you have will have the two energy levels quite close to each other and in things%0a%3c 40:48%0a%3c they are there where there are no vacant orbitals for example s in silicon dioxide the band gap as it's called it's%0a%3c 40:55%0a%3c going to be very high so you won't have any conductivity and rate in silicon%0a%3c 41:01%0a%3c dioxide whatsoever well then explain to me how PV electricity happens Peter like%0a%3c 41:07%0a%3c I mean I'm not saying you're wrong I'm just saying that that's not the complete picture of how charge can move that's one way%0a%3c 41:12%0a%3c PPC electricity is when when you apply pressure to a crystal in a bright a%0a%3c 41:18%0a%3c particular crystal and then since that is the move closer to each other or%0a%3c 41:24%0a%3c further apart from each other the distance of the the distance of the%0a%3c 41:29%0a%3c energy levels is actually going to change and that yields the effect that%0a%3c 41:35%0a%3c so first of all you need very specific crystals for that and the the pressure%0a%3c 41:45%0a%3c you will apply will do that right but it still shows that charge can move in a%0a%3c 41:52%0a%3c crystal oh if they can develop a voltage which means a difference in the voltage%0a%3c 41:58%0a%3c will be applied by head to head by pressing on it by applying pressure%0a%3c 42:03%0a%3c that's actually the other way around so you don't you don't start with the electricity you start with the pressure%0a%3c 42:09%0a%3c that is what you're advanced you can do both I mean just argue about PD%0a%3c 42:14%0a%3c electricity you can apply a voltage and it creates this strain in the material or you can create a strain in the%0a%3c 42:20%0a%3c material and it creates a voltage you can go either way but to me that shows just that charge can move in a crystal%0a%3c 42:27%0a%3c and you know silicon dioxide quartz crystal it can move it's not conduction%0a%3c 42:32%0a%3c obviously but there is mechanisms for to move alright so um let me just quickly%0a%3c 42:40%0a%3c go through my list yeah but what you%0a%3c 42:51%0a%3c said that it was that if the electrons could react with an iron nuclei you%0a%3c 42:56%0a%3c would get some sort of implosion can you see explain that to me before%0a%3c 43:02%0a%3c I'm having now I'm trying to first that the geology leads me to believe the gold%0a%3c 43:08%0a%3c is created in a certain way maybe it actually is to use electricity with the earthquakes I don't know but I'm%0a%3c 43:14%0a%3c thinking it the hydrogen sulfide because it's always found ourselves like minerals but anyway so where are we%0a%3c 43:20%0a%3c going to talk about um implosion oh that's right so the thought is that%0a%3c 43:26%0a%3c we're creating oxygen vacancies that this is the more chemical or physical%0a%3c 43:32%0a%3c understanding of going deeper into the geology of how it's actually happening so I'm thinking maybe this is the case%0a%3c 43:38%0a%3c this is not necessarily up yeah you're at this point kick in you're just left%0a%3c 43:43%0a%3c right show me what elephant clothing you mean sure so basically the there's in%0a%3c 43:49%0a%3c the structure there's you know two irons for every three oxygens so you have%0a%3c 43:54%0a%3c these oxygen atoms and iron atoms in the structure of hematite or iron oxide so%0a%3c 43:59%0a%3c an oxygen vacancy would be basically pulling out one of those oxygens from the structure so now it's like you%0a%3c 44:06%0a%3c have a building where a part of the building is pulled out so the in my mind%0a%3c 44:12%0a%3c the potential is for an implosion in that part now however bad you're%0a%3c 44:18%0a%3c actually think that removing an atom from a from a crystal would cost the other atoms to move closer to each other%0a%3c 44:23%0a%3c and collide is that what you're saying possibly because there would be here's%0a%3c 44:30%0a%3c the thing when you have oxygen in there that's basically a plus two charge I believe something like that so now it's%0a%3c 44:36%0a%3c on this - - - - okay okay is like the vacancies plus - yeah so basically you%0a%3c 44:44%0a%3c have a minus charge that's being removed from the structure now the irons could%0a%3c 44:49%0a%3c want to come together because there's that oxygen was basically repelling them%0a%3c 44:57%0a%3c so that's my thought with it um you have a problem that I have with it is that%0a%3c 45:03%0a%3c it's actually really hard to get atoms or to be more precise the nuclei close%0a%3c 45:10%0a%3c to each other because of the Coulomb barrier that's why nuclear reactions only work in very extreme conditions%0a%3c 45:16%0a%3c because put simply the two positively charged nuclei rule will repel each%0a%3c 45:22%0a%3c other the only effect that that costs them really to collide is the%0a%3c 45:28%0a%3c uncertainty principle the Heisenberg are you aware of that that probability%0a%3c 45:34%0a%3c recognize it but I don't remember you don't remember it okay yet basic basically says that the hotter you get%0a%3c 45:40%0a%3c the collision probability is going to be higher okay right and that is something%0a%3c 45:47%0a%3c really wired by and cold fusion is really unlikely because the collision%0a%3c 45:52%0a%3c probability is more less infinitely small at room temperatures right but this is this could be a whole new%0a%3c 45:58%0a%3c mechanism and that that would be okay you have that vacancy do you have a mechanism for that can you propose one%0a%3c 46:05%0a%3c vacancy today though you don't know how to overcome the Coulomb barrier um that%0a%3c 46:14%0a%3c would be with the Heisenberg effect yeah how do you do that low temperatures it would be a whole%0a%3c 46:20%0a%3c different mechanism so you know I'm Megan regret because my question can you propose it the mechanism yes that's what%0a%3c 46:27%0a%3c I'm saying is basically you create the oxygen vacancy somehow electrons fill%0a%3c 46:32%0a%3c that vacancy and now you get those iron atoms collapsing in on each other you%0a%3c 46:38%0a%3c get the negative charge from the electrode on the ions coming into that electron cloud but the collapsing iron%0a%3c 46:44%0a%3c iron sent them and sent us iron and iron nuclei would still have to overcome the%0a%3c 46:49%0a%3c Coulomb barrier so that's not yeah I mean the columbaria is a physical thing%0a%3c 46:55%0a%3c you can measure it you can't you can't offer you anything he's ever given situation you have to overcome it by%0a%3c 47:02%0a%3c basically yeah he's heating it up we're%0a%3c 47:08%0a%3c having the in the nuclear and really the first of all very densely packed which%0a%3c 47:14%0a%3c is by nuclear and nuclear reactions at least fusion reactions only happen and%0a%3c 47:19%0a%3c starts because that's the on the point where the pressure the temperature high enough and as I said you also need high temperature because that's the only way%0a%3c 47:26%0a%3c the the particles will be energy rich enough to overcome the Coulomb barrier%0a%3c 47:33%0a%3c okay right but I mean it's it's a different mechanism like let me try to%0a%3c 47:38%0a%3c make an example like right mechanism do you think that this reaction will be%0a%3c 47:46%0a%3c independent of the Coulomb barrier I have to look in the Coulomb barrier a%0a%3c 47:53%0a%3c little bit um but basically it's also called Coulomb wall maybe and you don't%0a%3c 47:59%0a%3c know it but ma'am okay yeah I definitely want to look into it more but what I'm%0a%3c 48:06%0a%3c saying is that you don't necessarily need the high temperatures if you know if instead of relying on random%0a%3c 48:13%0a%3c interactions and molecules where you need the high temperature so that they will react with enough force or whatever%0a%3c 48:19%0a%3c energy you want to call it um instead of that situation we basically have a vise%0a%3c 48:24%0a%3c where we're cramming them together so it would be a different%0a%3c 48:29%0a%3c parameters rather than heat needed like obviously the energy will still be needed but not necessarily in the form%0a%3c 48:36%0a%3c yeah but that's that's more like modest my question how are you going to apply%0a%3c 48:42%0a%3c enough energy for the two centers to fuse to one another well it would be in%0a%3c 48:47%0a%3c the form of a very high voltage in the order of a million volt is where I'm going recently when you buy acceleration%0a%3c 48:53%0a%3c because of all voltages itself in that case more than acceleration not acceleration just as a potential let's%0a%3c 49:00%0a%3c say you have an extremely high potential difference you have this extremely strong negative charge and those%0a%3c 49:05%0a%3c positive iron ions are just going to want to collapse you know yeah others want to that means acceleration because%0a%3c 49:12%0a%3c they at the end they will have to have modest the same location to react to one%0a%3c 49:18%0a%3c another right yes well you realize that%0a%3c 49:23%0a%3c the acceleration far VD the energy of%0a%3c 49:28%0a%3c the individual nuclei and the end you can convert that into the acceleration%0a%3c 49:34%0a%3c into the energy that I needed is not great and do you have any any mechanism%0a%3c 49:41%0a%3c to show that that it's possible in such a system well I mean we can look at that%0a%3c 49:47%0a%3c I don't remember what you called it something I wasn't aware of specifically and that is you know the bob thing with%0a%3c 49:54%0a%3c the nuclei finding inter tunes and brightening area so that's something good to know maybe that can help us like%0a%3c 50:01%0a%3c say okay we need three million volts for this to have the possibility of working yeah you're what three million volts you%0a%3c 50:08%0a%3c would need so so much electron volts right okay almost our voltage in%0a%3c 50:13%0a%3c electron volts are a unit of energy okay okay we would have to do some conversion%0a%3c 50:20%0a%3c but basically it would be in the form of a very high voltage so that would where%0a%3c 50:26%0a%3c the energy would be where the energy comes from okay um yeah that's small as all the questions as I had for tonight%0a%3c 50:33%0a%3c do you want to ask me anything or is that all right for you because we are%0a%3c 50:39%0a%3c almost at the one hour limit sounds about good all right then what I'm gonna do is first of all I think to%0a%3c 50:48%0a%3c do maybe want to do this another time again when you have looked into binding energy and so forth sure we definitely%0a%3c 50:54%0a%3c do that arm yeah I'm pretty busy lately but you know maybe I miss me as well as much yeah but%0a%3c 51:02%0a%3c not like a plan so what I'm going to do now is I'll open the hangout for the other guys if they want to join I do you%0a%3c 51:09%0a%3c want yeah or do you want to leave are probably going but alrighty so yeah%0a%3c 51:14%0a%3c thanks for coming on and see you then all right here take care all right so%0a%3c 51:27%0a%3c I'm going to send you the link first of all some of my friends Mariah should%0a%3c 51:35%0a%3c already have it but whatever microblog health soil error and others it%0a%3c 51:58%0a%3c Oh microblog hello yeah%0a%3c 52:05%0a%3c how's my sound little just check on the stream and there's some sort of cracking%0a%3c 52:11%0a%3c noise but I think it's alright yeah let me fix that okay%0a%3c 52:31%0a%3c how about now perfect good you%0a%3c 52:37%0a%3c hello I'm Mariah so that was interesting um for someone who claims to have%0a%3c 52:45%0a%3c studies chemistry he doesn't seem to actually understand it like I have a%0a%3c 52:51%0a%3c better grasp on it than he does I mean I mean he said that he would that he had a%0a%3c 52:57%0a%3c chemistry course in university but he said he would have studied it until like%0a%3c 53:05%0a%3c semester two or something that would be my equivalent and everything you do is until then learn how at least in%0a%3c 53:13%0a%3c practical chemistry like what like my my chemistry knowledge for the most part is%0a%3c 53:20%0a%3c because the chemistry I had in at university was basically like high level%0a%3c 53:28%0a%3c high school with high school chemistry it was very helpful MSM or less not more%0a%3c 53:35%0a%3c than high school and and I was able like I was able to tell W Singh was [ __ ]%0a%3c 53:41%0a%3c like it doesn't say that much yeah what what I was really curious about is why%0a%3c 53:46%0a%3c he thought that nuclear reactions for context of chemistry that's literally%0a%3c 53:51%0a%3c not how chemistry is defined but that's what I at least got from it and so that%0a%3c 53:57%0a%3c I think a couple of others in indicate at least that that what he was talking about was cold fusion yeah it works%0a%3c 54:04%0a%3c ah he's talking about he's talking about starting like yeah combining elements%0a%3c 54:13%0a%3c the nuclei have R elements to create heavy elements that from being cold fusion because it's not at high%0a%3c 54:18%0a%3c temperatures yeah so like as far as I know like chemistry is not circular%0a%3c 54:25%0a%3c physics yeah chemistry basically deals with the electron shells around okay how they%0a%3c 54:32%0a%3c behave you know I had and cells are totally irrelevant for chemistry not solely relevant just like no I mean I%0a%3c 54:39%0a%3c mean they're they have that we could theoretically describe them only by us being%0a%3c 54:44%0a%3c points with a certain medicine with a certain charge that's enough yeah then being composed of neutral and new%0a%3c 54:50%0a%3c transpire yeah yeah yeah the structure doesn't matter but they're all completely irrelevant they do not matter%0a%3c 54:57%0a%3c yeah some if it does I set that structures irrelevant yeah I think%0a%3c 55:04%0a%3c that's what confused me because I actually managed to follow some of the conversation and I don't know [ __ ] all about chemistry so it had to be like%0a%3c 55:10%0a%3c unrelated to chemistry as far as I know well it was a lot of it was like it was%0a%3c 55:16%0a%3c on the border between physics and chemistry both physically I have in%0a%3c 55:21%0a%3c terms of Yasim and sort of more well of the subject like let's let's grab me%0a%3c 55:28%0a%3c right like I know [ __ ] all about chemistry nor physics north declare%0a%3c 55:34%0a%3c physics etc etc and even I even I got from it but it was like not chemistry%0a%3c 55:40%0a%3c but rather something else so mm-hmm I think I think it's pretty sure like%0a%3c 55:46%0a%3c one thing is bida telling must to water-ski in here when said after you%0a%3c 55:52%0a%3c said that you're dealing you're dealing with electron volts not volts he%0a%3c 55:59%0a%3c basically said oh oh so we need a can we need some way to like converse some way to convert it yeah which is just like I%0a%3c 56:06%0a%3c don't think she actually got understood what you actually said okay yeah though%0a%3c 56:13%0a%3c to understand they don't understand electron volts basically a unit of energy here basically at the badly but%0a%3c 56:21%0a%3c yeah it's it's indeed a bad name the name comes from em if you have an electron and you pass it through an%0a%3c 56:26%0a%3c electric field with a potential difference of one volt then the electron will have one electron volt of kinetic%0a%3c 56:32%0a%3c energy afterwards that's the definition of an electron volt yeah and the reason which is the reason that this is useful%0a%3c 56:39%0a%3c is because when you're dealing with atomic atomic numbers I've been doing%0a%3c 56:44%0a%3c this entire thing in joules would be really annoying because the numbers would be really small so an electron%0a%3c 56:52%0a%3c volt is a rather good a good way to to calculate it%0a%3c 56:58%0a%3c it just it's not the best name Union if it's a convenient unit that's the point yeah yeah but the main name is sort of%0a%3c 57:05%0a%3c stupid because it's kind of like it implies yeah exactly well that's not the problem yeah yeah%0a%3c 57:11%0a%3c like mr. United for the children says isn't it more alchemy than chemistry or%0a%3c 57:18%0a%3c physics I see him toiling over a huge Black Cauldron dropping frog tails and eyes of Newt into it into the boiling%0a%3c 57:26%0a%3c smoking concoction um is now a time to point out that I%0a%3c 57:31%0a%3c have nude and far tails I actually just code word for code words for plans%0a%3c 57:37%0a%3c what's okay when when all when all like like witches things talk talk about like%0a%3c 57:45%0a%3c these gross things like I have new tales of frogs um they are actually using a%0a%3c 57:52%0a%3c [ __ ] ID code but would or like old names for specific medical medical like%0a%3c 57:57%0a%3c medical herbs and stuff like that still like I I pretty much see the same thing%0a%3c 58:05%0a%3c in my mind every day like if I did that in boiling another%0a%3c 58:12%0a%3c piss with which was one way someone thought he was gonna get go very thunder%0a%3c 58:18%0a%3c about yeah I found phosphorus Amber's yeah yeah he basically concentrated urine until%0a%3c 58:27%0a%3c hey I don't know the exact process just sir and yeah I feel wondering how he%0a%3c 58:33%0a%3c gets because there's a lot of other stuff in your employ a lot of the real%0a%3c 58:38%0a%3c it may be I don't know maybe and you boil it until justice as just solid left%0a%3c 58:45%0a%3c and then then you burn that and try to if you heat up if you heat up career%0a%3c 58:52%0a%3c does it then he said then decompose into ammonia and see if you like it does when%0a%3c 59:00%0a%3c you split with an unsub yeah shut to area Oh what would that's what you get%0a%3c 59:10%0a%3c out a thing is here to in a second they are%0a%3c 59:15%0a%3c talking about badly chat oh so I could spell also you have missed%0a%3c 59:25%0a%3c something yesterday oh my god no no no I watched yeah you watched okay yeah yeah%0a%3c 59:35%0a%3c I'm if you're a you raise brakes you race which is an enzyme breaks urea into%0a%3c 59:44%0a%3c but it okay it's combined with the water that's why yeah they mean the organizations or the oxidation state of%0a%3c 59:51%0a%3c the carbon atom is obviously +4 so that's why it makes sense that the%0a%3c 59:56%0a%3c entrance of this year to obviously I mean come on who doesn't know this yeah%0a%3c 1:00:04%0a%3c I mean everybody knows it was taken high school chemistry well I haven't taken high school chemistry because I'm a%0a%3c 1:00:10%0a%3c [ __ ] idiot but I do know patiently videos well this%0a%3c 1:00:19%0a%3c the revealing is for justice is for you race which is literally like an enzyme%0a%3c 1:00:25%0a%3c that breaks down the main component of P it can literally cut your P in pieces%0a%3c 1:00:31%0a%3c and yeah that no PP cutting to basically%0a%3c 1:00:37%0a%3c in my chemical katana super leaf an%0a%3c 1:00:42%0a%3c enzyme a lot of enzymes do that do that kind of [ __ ] that would be a simple but%0a%3c 1:00:50%0a%3c like our little our little mesh or little tools and machinery and building%0a%3c 1:00:55%0a%3c blocks yeah they're bad catalysts without them we wouldn't run and they%0a%3c 1:01:03%0a%3c they roll way yeah they lower the activation energy of the different reactions in our body%0a%3c 1:01:09%0a%3c yeah so very rare case but is that happening wouldn't happen at the temperature yet at the speed that they%0a%3c 1:01:15%0a%3c are without them yeah if they didn't have if we didn't have to happen we would have to have like like so like%0a%3c 1:01:23%0a%3c it's a lot of degrees high about the temperature I see function and then we would catch on fire yeah what what do you guys think%0a%3c 1:01:32%0a%3c about his claim that gold would be found as the gold that would be found in%0a%3c 1:01:37%0a%3c sewage would be an education of the processes right guys not you know it's%0a%3c 1:01:42%0a%3c not it comes from because you like sewage also just doesn't just like you%0a%3c 1:01:47%0a%3c said like plants and an animal like they don't need jobs like a lot of sewage%0a%3c 1:01:53%0a%3c comes from industry as well and yes I pointed out for example electronic waste what we want for well not even that like%0a%3c 1:02:00%0a%3c gold is used as a catalyst and some in some thing is the catalyst is used in%0a%3c 1:02:08%0a%3c some care like production of some chemicals or other coding in some some%0a%3c 1:02:15%0a%3c equipment but yeah the coding sure but I'm currently not aware of any%0a%3c 1:02:21%0a%3c large-scale industrial chemical process that uses directly goes with the catalyst core production I think the day%0a%3c 1:02:30%0a%3c you should platinum at least at least platinum platinum is widely used but%0a%3c 1:02:35%0a%3c gold as far as I'm aware I actually I figured out there are a lot of like yeah%0a%3c 1:02:41%0a%3c industrial things +44 stuff and that's how it ends up in the water biggest yeah%0a%3c 1:02:47%0a%3c but or comes like the mauryans of the same sewage system as true and poopy%0a%3c 1:02:55%0a%3c yeah and don't forget how many newlyweds dropped accidentally dropped their ring%0a%3c 1:03:01%0a%3c into the toilet onto a pile of [ __ ] and it gets flushed into the sewers I don't%0a%3c 1:03:08%0a%3c think that's the catechol he was talking about goals because you could obviously see that that sort of course would be a%0a%3c 1:03:15%0a%3c human waste and you guys may be the wrong word but race but also also he's%0a%3c 1:03:21%0a%3c wrong that we don't need gold you can there are you can get gold snaps yeah%0a%3c 1:03:27%0a%3c look and you can get this weird gold plate thing is you know for the shakiness have you not almost so if he%0a%3c 1:03:34%0a%3c wants to see someone eat go you can go to BuzzFeed like they have these crazy like like a three-dollar thing versus a%0a%3c 1:03:41%0a%3c $3,000 thing and most most of the things they eat that are crazy expensive are either coats in truffle or gold like the%0a%3c 1:03:49%0a%3c actual like wait wait can you get truffles colder than gold yes you%0a%3c 1:03:55%0a%3c probably can yes no I have I've watched them eat it%0a%3c 1:04:00%0a%3c there's there's even like I think it's the world's most expensive pizza whatever it is and it's talked with with%0a%3c 1:04:06%0a%3c with truffles and gold Leafs I don't know you're [ __ ] dying with us know%0a%3c 1:04:12%0a%3c as mr. unite for the cousin says Goldschlager yeah%0a%3c 1:04:17%0a%3c is it I think it that's a drink right yes uh hearing nouns we also have a%0a%3c 1:04:23%0a%3c drink which like this strong a strong ish likert-type deal with with golden%0a%3c 1:04:30%0a%3c it's it's it we call a gold strike you think it's [ __ ] disgusting I didn't I didn't even know ago schlager%0a%3c 1:04:36%0a%3c it's some sort of it sighs I guess like I said don't don't mess around old maps%0a%3c 1:04:44%0a%3c there you go there's a BuzzFeed article about gold coated things you can buy and eat yeah%0a%3c 1:04:49%0a%3c we have like a gold strike here in in the Netherlands which is just strong liquor type view which disgusting with a%0a%3c 1:04:56%0a%3c little bits of gold leaf in it so yeah I wonder how it goes if they probably%0a%3c 1:05:04%0a%3c taste much it's prolly tasteless it's like pro like that against the edge of a%0a%3c 1:05:11%0a%3c coin well what extra thing then Ben Tate there is that but there is also%0a%3c 1:05:17%0a%3c temperature thing because get it we have a hold in the beginning of the day of%0a%3c 1:05:23%0a%3c beautiful and and temperature effects a taste a lot hmm maybe tastes like it%0a%3c 1:05:29%0a%3c probably tastes like silver wait I might have a little silver coin over here give me a second%0a%3c 1:05:34%0a%3c yeah I also have a super cronut so no I don't I don't think it's going to taste like so because so silver is a lot more%0a%3c 1:05:41%0a%3c reactive than yeah oh yeah sure sure it's more active but I doubt it's reactive enough to a silver directing%0a%3c 1:05:47%0a%3c group that doesn't silver oxidized on your tongue ish oh I thought probably one of us in the%0a%3c 1:05:56%0a%3c chat is married I'm not touch with them sure to those who are married here in%0a%3c 1:06:02%0a%3c the chat and in the Hangout start chewing on your wedding rings have fun%0a%3c 1:06:07%0a%3c and don't forget you hard enough that bends and breaks well you're actually%0a%3c 1:06:13%0a%3c like most wedding rings are made of pure gold because that would be some flyable so yeah I usually then they are mixed%0a%3c 1:06:21%0a%3c with either copper or silver mine my dad actually has a ring that is made out of%0a%3c 1:06:27%0a%3c so pure gold that he can't actually wear it anymore because it's like it formed%0a%3c 1:06:34%0a%3c right I want our actual extra gold surprisingly soft yeah you can you could%0a%3c 1:06:39%0a%3c take the ring and you can you can essentially squeeze it flat if you want a senior sis like around LED pretty much%0a%3c 1:06:49%0a%3c to shame like clean laughing ball I think lettuce as far as I'm aware even a%0a%3c 1:06:54%0a%3c little softer yeah yeah I think lettuce softer hmm but I won't recommend licking or biting%0a%3c 1:07:00%0a%3c in let yeah man that is outside the hole%0a%3c 1:07:05%0a%3c and microblog do you know the story with a let lace twine and friends yeah it%0a%3c 1:07:12%0a%3c makes it safe sweeter yeah it's a each time they're actually and entire%0a%3c 1:07:18%0a%3c landscapes of people dying because the wine was laced with lead lead was used%0a%3c 1:07:23%0a%3c before we we if people realize that you died from it or get seriously brain%0a%3c 1:07:29%0a%3c damage it is let's say sweet so when people use the better that's not that%0a%3c 1:07:35%0a%3c itself usually um well no not the Matt lets out the ions obviously yeah well%0a%3c 1:07:42%0a%3c usually I learn about lettuce at a tiff usually use the sweetener what about some heavy metal poisoning between%0a%3c 1:07:48%0a%3c friends though let's be honest yeah I I%0a%3c 1:07:53%0a%3c shoot omelet when I was a kid yeah that explains a lot yeah it actually does explain why I'm a%0a%3c 1:08:00%0a%3c [ __ ] [ __ ] at least I know where my%0a%3c 1:08:06%0a%3c he hooker she comes from what is that they say everything in moderation I say%0a%3c 1:08:13%0a%3c works for them like that Levin yeah because everything in moderation%0a%3c 1:08:18%0a%3c acceptance let uranium and Mercury and stuff like that there there are a lot of%0a%3c 1:08:24%0a%3c things that weather where there are notes like safe service they've level up I was going to ask what's the actual%0a%3c 1:08:30%0a%3c talk toxicity or like how much do you need to consume oh let's see whether%0a%3c 1:08:36%0a%3c LME's if because I mean you you consume some naturally anyway well it's done I%0a%3c 1:08:43%0a%3c would let it's gonna depend on if it's if it's found so anything like because%0a%3c 1:08:50%0a%3c there are it's David mercury if it's like pure mercury like the slowly level%0a%3c 1:08:55%0a%3c stuff myself is surprisingly not that toxic but once you start combining it%0a%3c 1:09:02%0a%3c with them with organic where Alex so you have you have a mercury bounce to some%0a%3c 1:09:08%0a%3c organic molecule that's when you start getting problems so IP finally in the new file look like Anna what's called%0a%3c 1:09:16%0a%3c aggregate or some or in it well well it basically needs something like because our your body deals for mechanic stuff%0a%3c 1:09:23%0a%3c so it kind of needs like oh okay yeah sorry like kind of like hijacks the%0a%3c 1:09:29%0a%3c organic material and gets consumed by the yeah we're not worried your body your body doesn't really like like sweet%0a%3c 1:09:35%0a%3c pure metals like pure all non ion metals a lot they it's not something your body%0a%3c 1:09:41%0a%3c really is really used to handling yeah I mean if the metals are reactive enough%0a%3c 1:09:49%0a%3c they will obviously react with the stomach acid but though yes microblog said that the metal itself is usually%0a%3c 1:09:55%0a%3c quite harmless it's the ions that relate the problem for example for example mercury when you drink pure mercury the%0a%3c 1:10:02%0a%3c toxicity is really not so much the problem because it goes one pain in one and and leaves on the other but yeah%0a%3c 1:10:09%0a%3c again a organic compounds with mercury%0a%3c 1:10:14%0a%3c are really [ __ ] toxic so so stupid stupid chemistry question if it related%0a%3c 1:10:20%0a%3c - the same the same reason why we have certain metals as additives / accelerant%0a%3c 1:10:28%0a%3c / aggravates or whatever they're called in in in shots like vaccines and [ __ ]%0a%3c 1:10:34%0a%3c because I know they come for male yeah your thing of aluminum yeah no the reason the reason there is%0a%3c 1:10:41%0a%3c aluminum in I has it has it has this good name please call an adjunctive the%0a%3c 1:10:50%0a%3c junkman @h event I'm not your husband answer but it's basically um um it's in%0a%3c 1:10:59%0a%3c there because it triggers an immune reaction which increases the amount of%0a%3c 1:11:05%0a%3c antibodies produced the basically makes the vaccine work work better yeah also it's the reason why you get%0a%3c 1:11:12%0a%3c why you get like get a brick can get there and so the answer actually you%0a%3c 1:11:18%0a%3c think is better that's do you mean the action - yeah so aluminium or aluminum yeah I was really%0a%3c 1:11:26%0a%3c like if that's the same kind of chemical reaction as if it's a heavy metal is hijacking some organic material or well%0a%3c 1:11:33%0a%3c that's absolutely different all aluminum is a heavy metal a single size 5 ml and I wouldn't be so sure about that because%0a%3c 1:11:40%0a%3c there it is has no no it has no official definition of what the heavy metal actually is that's true but it is it is%0a%3c 1:11:46%0a%3c aluminum is usually like in terms of like health and biology is usually%0a%3c 1:11:52%0a%3c touched by a heavy metal to give both you and it's toxic like mercury isn't%0a%3c 1:11:58%0a%3c like certain of aluminum or aluminium it's like it's not healthy for you%0a%3c 1:12:03%0a%3c well but it has a reservoir at a higher but you need to like you need to get a%0a%3c 1:12:11%0a%3c lot of it yeah well I mean you can seem pretty much all metals naturally through%0a%3c 1:12:17%0a%3c theories - all right everybody breakfast obviously yes yeah well I uh it this%0a%3c 1:12:23%0a%3c quantity like it like most thinking I say something know what no like outside%0a%3c 1:12:29%0a%3c I also the smartest kid back in the mercury let and paint chip so let's just%0a%3c 1:12:39%0a%3c get the Pathet I pray my nature I won't be getting old I did some really wrong%0a%3c 1:12:50%0a%3c [ __ ] back in the day well getting old it's overrated anyway like your joints give out your muscles%0a%3c 1:12:56%0a%3c fade your head touches water yeah [ __ ] there's like all your ball anymore I'd%0a%3c 1:13:06%0a%3c rather go in a blaze of glory anyway shadow hmm oh yeah oh look pain I%0a%3c 1:13:12%0a%3c just read in the chat that drive is running a hangout as well oh yeah oh god what what is he doing now%0a%3c 1:13:19%0a%3c no idea I just I just like it was posted a lot abilities okay%0a%3c 1:13:25%0a%3c he's probably disproving carrot sometime yeah that seems like it you know the%0a%3c 1:13:34%0a%3c doesn't it maybe he's trying but he actually isn't it oh yeah you know what%0a%3c 1:13:39%0a%3c we mean yes you know how is it possible that an idiot like me is surrounded by people%0a%3c 1:13:46%0a%3c who are good in in s-tronic you know because you know yeah and good with%0a%3c 1:13:52%0a%3c engineering biology chemistry etc etc and Here I am a person who was eating%0a%3c 1:14:00%0a%3c less paint chips as a kid but you're not%0a%3c 1:14:05%0a%3c alone you're not at the low end of the bell curve that's the point so there will always somebody who is more idiotic%0a%3c 1:14:12%0a%3c than you well table one should always strive to surround themselves with people that are smarter than you so do%0a%3c 1:14:18%0a%3c you have the ability to learn well that's the thing like I I used to be a very smart kid%0a%3c 1:14:24%0a%3c not anymore it made sure of that yeah that I was very more than some of%0a%3c 1:14:30%0a%3c these idiots which I'm really really%0a%3c 1:14:36%0a%3c looking forward to actually seeing nature trying to do this experiment%0a%3c 1:14:41%0a%3c you know actually did you know if he has uploaded any footage of the experiment because I think I think you probably%0a%3c 1:14:48%0a%3c really wouldn't a little bit okay yeah I mean I wrote that but I didn't find it%0a%3c 1:14:55%0a%3c anywhere I did that on his YouTube channel I mean he's running another website but I haven't taken a look at%0a%3c 1:15:00%0a%3c that one can you imagine if he accidentally just [ __ ] started collision that [ __ ] [ __ ] happens you%0a%3c 1:15:10%0a%3c know what I would do I would literally just destroy myself a [ __ ] roof if that is if that happens we have to steal%0a%3c 1:15:17%0a%3c the ideas I steal the glory from him the credit for ramen because he cannot be%0a%3c 1:15:23%0a%3c the one who gets the [ __ ] platforming Nobel Prize well as awesome [ __ ] I will be stealing it from all of you%0a%3c 1:15:28%0a%3c [ __ ] guys I will be the smart one he would probably be be it be some or do it%0a%3c 1:15:35%0a%3c somewhere somehow that I would like just accidentally do it and I have no [ __ ]%0a%3c 1:15:40%0a%3c idea how to repeat it but that's something I would do since it's well I%0a%3c 1:15:45%0a%3c mean we we don't have we don't have to we would have have the advantages that%0a%3c 1:15:50%0a%3c we would know and we will know the publicity is in peer-reviewed literature%0a%3c 1:15:56%0a%3c which is how you get a Nobel Prize yeah a bio loading into YouTube but youtube%0a%3c 1:16:02%0a%3c is peer reviewed right right right he's in the chat hello and what kind of%0a%3c 1:16:12%0a%3c radiation do they get emitted because might be possible that with platinum%0a%3c 1:16:18%0a%3c electrolysis you might get some x-ray radiation but yeah actually what's put%0a%3c 1:16:25%0a%3c to see the veritable energy in verses like like isn't isn't it like with a%0a%3c 1:16:30%0a%3c fusion and [ __ ] like isn't it like gamma radiation or something like that%0a%3c 1:16:38%0a%3c really well recognizing and so there are three main types of nuclear radiation%0a%3c 1:16:48%0a%3c alpha rays which are typically in the%0a%3c 1:16:54%0a%3c military today that is either electrons or positrons like gamma radiation which are high-energy photons which is%0a%3c 1:17:01%0a%3c ionizing great yeah yeah yeah so pretty much there are like lesson three may%0a%3c 1:17:07%0a%3c remain sighs we have like weird soft failures and murders yes there are%0a%3c 1:17:12%0a%3c electron texturing processes and even proton emissions and yeah but that's%0a%3c 1:17:18%0a%3c kind of well that's rather rant you only find it in really exotic isotopes for example um there are some isotopes with%0a%3c 1:17:25%0a%3c a really high a proton to Neutron Neutron ratio where you actually get proton emission yeah okay so he says%0a%3c 1:17:34%0a%3c yeah I think it was x-ray but still but that's what he says well guess what%0a%3c 1:17:40%0a%3c like in all yes they have an x-ray machine in there and there's no fusion%0a%3c 1:17:45%0a%3c reactor there yeah that small as my point in order to have evidence of%0a%3c 1:17:51%0a%3c nuclear reactions you actually need one of the three reaction one of the 3d edge%0a%3c 1:17:56%0a%3c radiation types that I was talking about can I swap the optin or I don't get a%0a%3c 1:18:04%0a%3c you you you don't only get x-rays from nuclear reactions what do you gamble is%0a%3c 1:18:10%0a%3c what when what one one an electrode put it leaves or whatever an electron no%0a%3c 1:18:18%0a%3c gamma is bases that you have an abundance of energy in in the nucleus%0a%3c 1:18:26%0a%3c it's not the electrons like that would be like a massive message like you have to like basic fall down and yes for%0a%3c 1:18:34%0a%3c example for example in when you're talking about x-rays what happens is%0a%3c 1:18:40%0a%3c that an electron will which is in the high energy state falls down into a lower initial state and the difference%0a%3c 1:18:45%0a%3c of energy is emitted eggs as a photon for example as an x-ray photon the same applies to%0a%3c 1:18:51%0a%3c um nuclei only that the energies are much higher therefore you get a higher energy of the photon and that's what a%0a%3c 1:18:57%0a%3c gamma-ray is well I I know what garish it's some serious death that's what it is%0a%3c 1:19:02%0a%3c yes well they're relatively speaking gammas are relatively harmless%0a%3c 1:19:07%0a%3c it's the alpha rays that kill ya if you get the emitter out of you%0a%3c 1:19:12%0a%3c yeah keyword being relatively speaking yeah it's both differences like Yemen like%0a%3c 1:19:19%0a%3c most of the gamma radiations just gonna pass right through you yeah it's it's%0a%3c 1:19:24%0a%3c the gamma radiation that is not passing through you that kills you yeah but yeah%0a%3c 1:19:30%0a%3c we gamma radiation that really reacts in your body is already and ionisers a%0a%3c 1:19:36%0a%3c molecule in your body it's relatively small yeah where is it where is yeah I'll read a little problem when you have%0a%3c 1:19:43%0a%3c it in the idea because you I don't know leak uranium or something that really%0a%3c 1:19:49%0a%3c gets you well I caused by for example alpha radiation cannot pass paper also it%0a%3c 1:19:55%0a%3c means that other emitted alpha particles will ionize that paper well is a%0a%3c 1:20:02%0a%3c wavelength issue or would know what it is it's a matter that ultimately%0a%3c 1:20:07%0a%3c extraction of her well where alpha particles cause young helium nuclei give%0a%3c 1:20:13%0a%3c the message something oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah well I think back to the%0a%3c 1:20:19%0a%3c elephant's foot in Chernobyl yesterday I look at that go on just Google what that%0a%3c 1:20:25%0a%3c chain is oh yeah I know I know what Yelp and for this yeah for those who don't%0a%3c 1:20:31%0a%3c know the elephant what is a piece of basically molten well it most multi-use%0a%3c 1:20:38%0a%3c I will after of the reactor it is not just real isn't it still technically the%0a%3c 1:20:45%0a%3c most radioactive place on the planet that's what the thing is radioactive is%0a%3c 1:20:50%0a%3c [ __ ] it's so radioactive that or like all the pages have been taken off and I%0a%3c 1:20:55%0a%3c like that you can see that the damage is to them and Wednesday when like like%0a%3c 1:21:02%0a%3c right up that you know what happens they they flew over the area like the fool%0a%3c 1:21:07%0a%3c over grx and took pictures and like the pictures were like fine when they took%0a%3c 1:21:12%0a%3c them but then like it didn't take it was like when they actually brought them back they were like they look like [ __ ]%0a%3c 1:21:19%0a%3c because the radiation had just [ __ ] up the film yes so it's not only photos you can also see that in videos of%0a%3c 1:21:25%0a%3c helicopter footage flying out of the reactor that is sparkling effects on the%0a%3c 1:21:31%0a%3c on the film and that is a direct cause of radiated irradiation hitting hitting%0a%3c 1:21:36%0a%3c the film yes that's the reason why when you know in a lot of us of that%0a%3c 1:21:42%0a%3c elephant's foot thing like nothing looks gnarly like if you see like the all the%0a%3c 1:21:48%0a%3c distortions on the picture like you don't want to get close to that [ __ ] thing at least three [ __ ] leaders so%0a%3c 1:21:54%0a%3c you want to get close to the thing at least three kilometres I don't believe it did yeah did you guys ever ever watch%0a%3c 1:22:04%0a%3c the hangout that Fiona Robertson had about it was one of like it was none%0a%3c 1:22:11%0a%3c meltdown or anything but it's one of the the worst the worst radiation related%0a%3c 1:22:17%0a%3c accidents that wasn't like a meltdown in I think it was Japan where two people%0a%3c 1:22:24%0a%3c actually died two people on their own saved the entire plant by and I'm afraid%0a%3c 1:22:32%0a%3c I forget exactly how it happened but it was something like they closed%0a%3c 1:22:37%0a%3c they closed something that was highly highly highly radioactive and it they essentially became two case studies on%0a%3c 1:22:44%0a%3c on extreme radiation as they died no I haven't had off that case to be honest%0a%3c 1:22:49%0a%3c wasn't interesting to him to at least read about it it's I think Fiona posted%0a%3c 1:22:55%0a%3c papers on it and [ __ ] and it was like he got [ __ ] nasty like what one other%0a%3c 1:23:01%0a%3c guy like did this the skin and flesh would actually let go of his bone structure ah I actually got a picture of%0a%3c 1:23:10%0a%3c the elephant's foot and it's it's it's an eerie [ __ ] picture yeah basically%0a%3c 1:23:16%0a%3c just them open clump of metal that's cool oh these pictures actually it's so distorted like%0a%3c 1:23:23%0a%3c there were people standing in front of it and it's so distort that they are like disappearing on the big syringe%0a%3c 1:23:28%0a%3c it's [ __ ] weird tonight yeah you guys know what the demon coils yes I know%0a%3c 1:23:35%0a%3c loudness that's so that even covers about a piece of truth Sonia my think that was used in the development of%0a%3c 1:23:42%0a%3c hydrogen bombs yeah and there were two individual accidents with that car over%0a%3c 1:23:48%0a%3c the club of plutonium but one's a bit like so somebody actually dropped to two%0a%3c 1:23:54%0a%3c parts of two-tone IAM together and the reaction was thought and then he kicked he kicked one of them away but a%0a%3c 1:24:00%0a%3c direction had always started so much that he would die later thirty-eight embroider and then after and then afterwards a%0a%3c 1:24:07%0a%3c group of scientists tried to recreate the accident and the entire thing happened again%0a%3c 1:24:12%0a%3c well it didn't that like was a good thing like very close to what's called%0a%3c 1:24:20%0a%3c critical mass yeah it was what's the point I did too are they did the drop down%0a%3c 1:24:26%0a%3c might be a neutron reflector made of tungsten that I dropped on it and then%0a%3c 1:24:33%0a%3c it would reach critical mass and start reacting the congress-led later used as a part of a hydrogen bomb in the bikini%0a%3c 1:24:40%0a%3c at all the stars are aware I'm actually sharing the picture of the elephant's food right now yeah it's eerie [ __ ]%0a%3c 1:24:46%0a%3c picture right how do I have in show you I don't want to get close to that [ __ ]%0a%3c 1:24:53%0a%3c thing well I think I just got ten thousand times the recommended amount of%0a%3c 1:25:00%0a%3c radiation how many bananas I have to go%0a%3c 1:25:06%0a%3c yes bananas is is a unit of radiation oh%0a%3c 1:25:12%0a%3c that's something I should have asked nature hacker because he claimed in a video that he would be able to heal%0a%3c 1:25:18%0a%3c radiation yeah which is which fruit%0a%3c 1:25:24%0a%3c unless feel the most radiation II if you want if Norman if you're standing on%0a%3c 1:25:31%0a%3c [ __ ] you prolly Slimer ginge die so I've heard you prolly to the radiation%0a%3c 1:25:37%0a%3c I've heard that if you're standing close to a highly radioactive source the air%0a%3c 1:25:42%0a%3c tastes metally yeah - look land well I've stood close to a bar of%0a%3c 1:25:48%0a%3c uranium-238 but I didn't feel anything yeah or it depends of what well well%0a%3c 1:25:54%0a%3c your areas where one of the professors of the University we're back he's doing a risk research in uranium%0a%3c 1:26:02%0a%3c complex chemistry and si as I saw so uranium he has simply a metal block of%0a%3c 1:26:09%0a%3c of uranium that he stores inside a let even isn't it like like you need to do a%0a%3c 1:26:17%0a%3c whole bunch of [ __ ] to make your radium actually dangerously radioactive uranium%0a%3c 1:26:25%0a%3c itself is not really so dangerous if you don't they ingested in some way well%0a%3c 1:26:32%0a%3c yeah well don't you have to like enriched or something like that to make it like some serious depth type of deal%0a%3c 1:26:39%0a%3c and no and when when you have pure uranium the 238 isotope will kill you if%0a%3c 1:26:46%0a%3c you ingest it well yeah it's not over sometimes you will at least get whether%0a%3c 1:26:51%0a%3c the cancer probability probability goes for the roof even in low concentrations and so forth well then again how the%0a%3c 1:27:01%0a%3c [ __ ] do I close this [ __ ] how the hell do i shut the sharing stuff I have to do%0a%3c 1:27:08%0a%3c yeah all right you have to stop sharing your screen that he was just you were just still%0a%3c 1:27:14%0a%3c being presented yeah I don't know how to do that [ __ ] yeah you know Jill consoles%0a%3c 1:27:19%0a%3c that ah but by the way jail is like just in case you haven't seen it I I linked%0a%3c 1:27:25%0a%3c the name tokheim Laura is what it's okay I'm over okay yeah that that thing%0a%3c 1:27:31%0a%3c because it I just I remember fear if you don't know how to hang a hang out about it two years ago I%0a%3c 1:27:37%0a%3c linked the the short video she made she also had a hangout lasted for like two or three hours%0a%3c 1:27:43%0a%3c uh and it did one of the reasons is Nasty's because it essentially by it%0a%3c 1:27:49%0a%3c like after the events had transpired they essentially violated everything you%0a%3c 1:27:55%0a%3c can even remotely consider to be it to be human rights and turned the guy into%0a%3c 1:28:01%0a%3c a living experiment oh yeah I see that that's I've seen that isolation shipment%0a%3c 1:28:06%0a%3c guy odd into it took 80 something day eighty seven days that meant like the%0a%3c 1:28:13%0a%3c the skin was falling off his bones it was that [ __ ] uh yeah like they couldn't get in graph statistic like it%0a%3c 1:28:22%0a%3c was just it was just falling off it I've seen that I have actually read that ship%0a%3c 1:28:29%0a%3c like radiation poisoning is one health drug that's some scary [ __ ] [ __ ] yeah%0a%3c 1:28:35%0a%3c in that case the most humane thing would probably to shoot this guy in the face yeah yeah like I don't remember the full%0a%3c 1:28:43%0a%3c story anymore but there were two people that was exposed to it and one of them died relatively quickly the other one%0a%3c 1:28:50%0a%3c unfortunately lived a long-ass time well he didn't live a long as time they%0a%3c 1:28:55%0a%3c kept him alive well yeah like that they did everything%0a%3c 1:29:01%0a%3c to keep that man alive just to see what the radiation would do to him yeah they were plugged in full of fluid to take%0a%3c 1:29:08%0a%3c him alive it's it's running too rickety diem one of the guys was exposed to%0a%3c 1:29:14%0a%3c seventeen seasons of radiation and the other one to ten usually those of eight%0a%3c 1:29:21%0a%3c fevers is um thought to be lethal yeah well I'm tensed practically a death%0a%3c 1:29:28%0a%3c sentence oh that man like I've seen pictures of it like he was lying on this [ __ ] rag type deal right and you just%0a%3c 1:29:38%0a%3c see a guy lying there without a [ __ ] skin it's pretty much that wha what what this old old guy Murad IV was like he%0a%3c 1:29:47%0a%3c was just a well a man skinned alive by radiation yes gnarly I've seen it all so%0a%3c 1:29:55%0a%3c uh this guy was called Masato Shinohara yeah well he's not Mossad to%0a%3c 1:30:02%0a%3c skin a life out huh no not anymore no he he now did well%0a%3c 1:30:09%0a%3c fortunately yeah like he should he should have just been killed yeah it's one of those cases where like%0a%3c 1:30:17%0a%3c um so a lot of medical knowledge has been gained through doing really [ __ ]%0a%3c 1:30:24%0a%3c nasty [ __ ] just like this well but it's still atrocious to treat someone like%0a%3c 1:30:29%0a%3c like oh yeah well what it mean it's an insight I don't think we've ever ever%0a%3c 1:30:34%0a%3c had that kind of insight before or since not that I justify him in any way well%0a%3c 1:30:39%0a%3c Joyce house yeah like let's do almost like like a world war ii like the what%0a%3c 1:30:50%0a%3c what Josef Mengele did like that [ __ ] [ __ ] was also [ __ ] the trolls but we did learn a lot about religion we didn't%0a%3c 1:30:58%0a%3c really learn a whole lot about from his from what he did um something that is%0a%3c 1:31:04%0a%3c she was she was yeah but for the most part he was working under basically like%0a%3c 1:31:09%0a%3c Nazi assumptions about how genetics and inheritance worked true true but the thing said that he did%0a%3c 1:31:17%0a%3c find he did record them and people were able to get that yeah maybe we didn't%0a%3c 1:31:24%0a%3c learn like we didn't blow it like follow burn piece ISM is a like a big what them%0a%3c 1:31:29%0a%3c like sort of it what's interesting in some ways yes my question is if is%0a%3c 1:31:36%0a%3c morally okay to tell you is yes no and yeah you're not in my opinion no no no%0a%3c 1:31:42%0a%3c no no sorry no it's one wrong to do it but it's not more wrong to use data against see a problem in like like you%0a%3c 1:31:50%0a%3c like the data is still dated the data still shows that it's shows there's no problem in using using it just because%0a%3c 1:31:56%0a%3c it came from them from something nasty but we wouldn't need to use this data%0a%3c 1:32:01%0a%3c today because we we have data on on those subjects%0a%3c 1:32:07%0a%3c have been acquired through ethical means Oh moral of the story though is it's%0a%3c 1:32:14%0a%3c that a lot of our medical knowledge come from very unethical ways of requiring%0a%3c 1:32:21%0a%3c those not that knowledge now most of our medical knowledge doesn't really come%0a%3c 1:32:28%0a%3c from that like UNITA comes from a an age where those things were seen as morally%0a%3c 1:32:36%0a%3c wrong or they come from a modern age where there is like there are faculty%0a%3c 1:32:42%0a%3c okay I'll tell ya housing you have been helping he one cycle the whole thing you%0a%3c 1:32:48%0a%3c see something there are like rules that protect protected during human trials I%0a%3c 1:32:54%0a%3c was told the Helsinki something and then some guy got ready it irradiated to a%0a%3c 1:33:02%0a%3c high hell and there he is lying on a [ __ ] bed stripped of all of his [ __ ] skin which is not nephew a%0a%3c 1:33:09%0a%3c duration of housing health and key right I I won't even be able to do something%0a%3c 1:33:18%0a%3c like that to someone something like that [ __ ] bad it's a but it is true that a%0a%3c 1:33:26%0a%3c lot of our medical knowledge has been learned through a lot a lot but there are we've learned a few things through%0a%3c 1:33:35%0a%3c through accidents it's so when when I talked about that I'm thinking like%0a%3c 1:33:41%0a%3c we're talking like really really really really basic stuff like gutting people to see how the organs were cutting%0a%3c 1:33:47%0a%3c people up alive to see like how does the heart beat how does in that kind of%0a%3c 1:33:52%0a%3c thing like back in back in the te Kiwi days of call it medical science in in%0a%3c 1:33:58%0a%3c quotation marks well we did that I've [ __ ] like clicking the what's it called%0a%3c 1:34:06%0a%3c our Cajun [ __ ] yeah well it from what I understand it%0a%3c 1:34:11%0a%3c also happened during some of the more modern Wars oh oh yeah the fact of like%0a%3c 1:34:17%0a%3c chemical weapons and so oh yeah yeah one one strain it once you're in a whoa whoa you suddenly are like I mean%0a%3c 1:34:24%0a%3c you already have planning to kill people so suddenly the moles become a bit more loose yeah think about like in World War%0a%3c 1:34:32%0a%3c two the the Japanese actually did [ __ ] like that and the Nazi also did [ __ ]%0a%3c 1:34:38%0a%3c like that but not with chemical weapons I've heard horror stories about some%0a%3c 1:34:45%0a%3c some of or what happened to certain peer wzm yelled a Japanese not fun monstrous%0a%3c 1:34:51%0a%3c with with the with some of those [ __ ] cancel - god damn like if you think%0a%3c 1:34:57%0a%3c about what those people did back in those times Jesus [ __ ] it's like so%0a%3c 1:35:04%0a%3c always always keep a gun on the inside of your of your jacket so you can shoot%0a%3c 1:35:09%0a%3c yourself if you get captured yeah it will so I find out capsule yeah I mean there's a reason what that is%0a%3c 1:35:17%0a%3c actually an option for people that go into like really dangerous areas well it%0a%3c 1:35:25%0a%3c won't be wrong like I rather get like a a cyanide capsule then being you for for%0a%3c 1:35:32%0a%3c human Charleston's yeah once per second I think I think actually I would much%0a%3c 1:35:38%0a%3c rather shoot myself than say a finite filthy a cyanide is not a fun waves died no I feel better than being like got it%0a%3c 1:35:45%0a%3c alive oh yeah not now resi all discussion which method of suicide is%0a%3c 1:35:51%0a%3c the best one but usually they make taken over those are some saying any love%0a%3c 1:35:57%0a%3c something you fall asleep yeah aperture rights or something is probably the best way micro sync if it's right or it's%0a%3c 1:36:03%0a%3c like Shia night or it's getting what's a%0a%3c 1:36:10%0a%3c [ __ ] eternal life I ranch well eating your life my rats wouldn't love this one%0a%3c 1:36:17%0a%3c yeah so I I would choose for the cyanide each along oh yeah no no I was comparing%0a%3c 1:36:22%0a%3c I was crying shooting myself on cyanide I've never cut for shoot myself okay yeah I played it up with honored to know%0a%3c 1:36:29%0a%3c that getting eaten alive by raft is not fun no but it's just [ __ ] people are awful%0a%3c 1:36:42%0a%3c doctor for what I think we have to tap a scientific study for this yeah good luck%0a%3c 1:36:48%0a%3c finding volunteers hit well no no good luck getting it past the ethics%0a%3c 1:36:54%0a%3c committee what is it alright right we don't listen sample size I don't like%0a%3c 1:37:01%0a%3c like I'm not against like human trials really if it's done to the right people%0a%3c 1:37:08%0a%3c like people who are condemned to death anyway like let's say let's say I laugh%0a%3c 1:37:17%0a%3c at all but hold on like they can choose like okay you can sell your body to%0a%3c 1:37:23%0a%3c let's say science a your family gets the money or you just go on on the [ __ ]%0a%3c 1:37:30%0a%3c chair you get roasting I'm alright I think you have a misconception event when you donate your body to an%0a%3c 1:37:36%0a%3c institution it's all it's after you there yes it's a few that is necessarily%0a%3c 1:37:42%0a%3c see at all here in Germany some institutions some hospital some universities actually take a fee another%0a%3c 1:37:49%0a%3c not gif yes no but not dual identity here like I deliver guys hold on shut up%0a%3c 1:37:56%0a%3c hold on like what I mean right is let's say you have you're condemned to death right and%0a%3c 1:38:03%0a%3c you can choose okay you're going to get on the chair roast it not no%0a%3c 1:38:11%0a%3c contribution to to your family no contribution to society whatsoever you get roasted dead into the ground or%0a%3c 1:38:19%0a%3c on a [ __ ] mass grave that's about it or you can choose okay Charles okay you%0a%3c 1:38:25%0a%3c will [ __ ] suffer like a [ __ ] your family will get money plus you're contributing to society and it is so%0a%3c 1:38:32%0a%3c vivid in still I'll ever call you you wouldn't you wouldn't like you give%0a%3c 1:38:37%0a%3c those people then the choice at least and then you know every time I it's so%0a%3c 1:38:43%0a%3c different no it's the it's still unethical you would never get this power passed an ethics committee no%0a%3c 1:38:51%0a%3c but also infamy LegalZoom like you would get a victim yeah I would see it has to%0a%3c 1:39:02%0a%3c be this is actually a real conversation that I had imagined for today and and%0a%3c 1:39:09%0a%3c remember I was talking to the crazy cousin of Charles Phillips no seriously%0a%3c 1:39:17%0a%3c like I I do not see a prong with that if people get to choice if they are condemned tell me you allowed to%0a%3c 1:39:22%0a%3c experiment on yourself there's no there's no there's no rules like you can%0a%3c 1:39:28%0a%3c do all the horrible [ __ ] to yourself like that is Emma's point what yep%0a%3c 1:39:36%0a%3c that's the thing like I personally think that people's when someone is condemned%0a%3c 1:39:41%0a%3c to death like that they can choose okay I can do human charge okay I live a%0a%3c 1:39:46%0a%3c little bit longer but I suffer like a [ __ ] when I family gets money and I might contribute to society yeah but but%0a%3c 1:39:53%0a%3c I rose and wouldn't it then make more sense to be executed by organ donation for example well that's that's an option%0a%3c 1:40:02%0a%3c like don't get me wrong like if they do like for controls like like you will get%0a%3c 1:40:07%0a%3c like [ __ ] an established that type of [ __ ] of course like you [ __ ] that [ __ ]%0a%3c 1:40:15%0a%3c know what I mean yeah but that's [ __ ] up anyway it is [ __ ] up but but I%0a%3c 1:40:23%0a%3c perspective that the problem is that if you're able to do the research more%0a%3c 1:40:28%0a%3c ethic in a more ethical way no one is ever gonna it's not ever gonna be%0a%3c 1:40:35%0a%3c approved like at nature I activate a good like makes one good point when you%0a%3c 1:40:40%0a%3c talk about the animal research like the reason you have to like he would he studies as he said you have to prove%0a%3c 1:40:47%0a%3c that you need to do it in rats and you can't do it in lower organisms because there are very very strict pools%0a%3c 1:40:54%0a%3c automatically and you try to use the type of animal that is the least sentient%0a%3c 1:41:00%0a%3c yeah but and the amp but still able to give you to the sort who needs and yeah%0a%3c 1:41:05%0a%3c I very valid intimated from my program I think it's only like it's only ten percent of like medical results that%0a%3c 1:41:13%0a%3c I've heard of that are found in bad that I am act like in lab rats but like that%0a%3c 1:41:25%0a%3c actually end up turning and becoming restored useful results in humans okay%0a%3c 1:41:31%0a%3c out of curiosity what would you use if I don't if you can't use the read a monkey%0a%3c 1:41:39%0a%3c will have you Marley monkey wouldn't they be a rhesus rhesus monkeys not yes%0a%3c 1:41:45%0a%3c well you know big ape so why not use like damned conflict just saying I I do%0a%3c 1:41:54%0a%3c not see the difference in a rhesus monkey or a [ __ ] because if a biggest%0a%3c 1:41:59%0a%3c a humans because the member of our own species because they are not not only that but but there's no time collect%0a%3c 1:42:06%0a%3c actually tell you that is sentient yeah it's the same ethical thing as in%0a%3c 1:42:12%0a%3c light value it's okay to eat other [ __ ] but not people because it's just a member or I do not see a problem in%0a%3c 1:42:21%0a%3c using a conflict who is going to get the%0a%3c 1:42:27%0a%3c chair anyway I do not see the problem in that but at least give them the choice and give their families a compensation%0a%3c 1:42:35%0a%3c well like the idea well that it doesn't it doesn't it almost doesn't matter what kind of crimes you've done you still%0a%3c 1:42:42%0a%3c keep your innate rights oh yeah like for the most part there's obviously exceptions%0a%3c 1:42:47%0a%3c well I mindful no yes I think there shouldn't be any exceptions you get to%0a%3c 1:42:53%0a%3c keep your human rights no matter what no I in in practice right so there's%0a%3c 1:42:59%0a%3c certain crimes for you in my opinion a powerful should not have any [ __ ] rotation all this will be used for that%0a%3c 1:43:06%0a%3c [ __ ] no what the [ __ ] those guys the problem with saying that is that you were the%0a%3c 1:43:11%0a%3c most obvious denying someone else's romantic there is a big problem in doing that because if you didn't violate his human%0a%3c 1:43:17%0a%3c rights and it turns out he was innocent yes you yeah you now have sent a%0a%3c 1:43:23%0a%3c narrative giant like you will now but the bad guy oh yeah yeah yeah Danny Lang's let me point as I am with%0a%3c 1:43:31%0a%3c to the side who loses his human rights and who isn't I mean that's a [ __ ] slippery slope right there yeah I know%0a%3c 1:43:37%0a%3c and this is actually this is one of the the the the arguments why like here nor%0a%3c 1:43:43%0a%3c will we don't actually have a life in prison or capital punishment that's because I guess the same away I think%0a%3c 1:43:49%0a%3c they lay beyond Europeans over here shop near me and we all are more Europeans%0a%3c 1:43:54%0a%3c and sorry but I do not agree with that type of [ __ ] like personally I think yes%0a%3c 1:43:59%0a%3c we should have a death penalty here and I believe it is not even a good%0a%3c 1:44:04%0a%3c punishment I give you one a punish someone spilling a life in prison is a far greater punishment then yeah having%0a%3c 1:44:12%0a%3c kill yeah I mean Michael deserves it and actually already made in my opinion but%0a%3c 1:44:18%0a%3c the point the main point is that why I am against the death penalty is we can't 100%25 make sure that somebody's really%0a%3c 1:44:25%0a%3c guilty and even though physically if you kill just just one single inmates who turns out to be innocent I said we%0a%3c 1:44:31%0a%3c can't the process yeah well it's a C so there's so there are certain cases like just just just%0a%3c 1:44:37%0a%3c just bring it up just because it's it's still kind of a relevant case it's remember the the mass shooting we had a%0a%3c 1:44:44%0a%3c Norway I think yeah yeah right yeah right doing dude like the yeah straight%0a%3c 1:44:49%0a%3c yeah so there's a lot of people that advocated the death sentence for him%0a%3c 1:44:55%0a%3c simply that like it's not a question who did it well it is that is that is%0a%3c 1:45:01%0a%3c [ __ ] us that is a closed case because like it was the only one on on the island with the kids right so it's like%0a%3c 1:45:07%0a%3c it is a closed case we know who it was and we know why did it and we know how he did it right so so it all just%0a%3c 1:45:14%0a%3c [ __ ] ass it's simple as that yeah so and then it becomes then becomes%0a%3c 1:45:19%0a%3c a different a different question right it's so one if is to remove him%0a%3c 1:45:27%0a%3c then you know kill him he's gone but he can then become a symbol for someone%0a%3c 1:45:33%0a%3c else if right so and and then the counter-argument is right now he's%0a%3c 1:45:40%0a%3c essentially continuing to be sort of like a assist to society right he's%0a%3c 1:45:48%0a%3c still hogging resources he's still being a nuisance to the society so there's the like right there you can see it from%0a%3c 1:45:55%0a%3c from both both sigh I know what you mean like yeah like they don't want him to%0a%3c 1:46:01%0a%3c become a [ __ ] martyr oh yeah of course I know that but I personally%0a%3c 1:46:06%0a%3c think pretty much this [ __ ] that guy Rose is [ __ ] it so he stops breathing%0a%3c 1:46:12%0a%3c my [ __ ] air that's [ __ ] lie like but that guy [ __ ] people like that yeah%0a%3c 1:46:17%0a%3c but it but then also again it becomes the question like if you love it for one person then then the then you have to%0a%3c 1:46:24%0a%3c stir the line somewhere like when do we allow it when do we disallow it and then%0a%3c 1:46:29%0a%3c just like Diaz said it becomes a question of okay well what if it's one%0a%3c 1:46:34%0a%3c innocent person it's just living it up with a lot of statistic in America I%0a%3c 1:46:40%0a%3c think two or three years ago that about four or five percent of everybody on death row was innocent yeah which is the%0a%3c 1:46:46%0a%3c [ __ ] disturbing which is especially like it took in the country like the states where they execute what it's like%0a%3c 1:46:52%0a%3c a couple of dozen people every every year 2030 us okay I am yeah right so the%0a%3c 1:46:59%0a%3c first like let's say 5%25 to take a relatively high number that's still we're talking a person or two a year%0a%3c 1:47:05%0a%3c right I know so it's but but still like%0a%3c 1:47:10%0a%3c I do not see a problem with using people who get the death penalty anyway to use%0a%3c 1:47:18%0a%3c the most lebreton agency so the problem becomes a slippery slope thing because%0a%3c 1:47:25%0a%3c if you if you start if you start killing people for say murder right okay well%0a%3c 1:47:33%0a%3c how do you then quantify murder in all cases because how can how can you prove%0a%3c 1:47:38%0a%3c in a case where it's uncertain if it was just killing or something that was actually%0a%3c 1:47:44%0a%3c intentional ie murder right because if it then it becomes a question of be%0a%3c 1:47:49%0a%3c honest catalyst of a doubt so it is always that slippery slope and all of a sudden if the slope is steep enough you%0a%3c 1:47:58%0a%3c can find yourself on the wrong end of it and now you don't want that enabled anymore%0a%3c 1:48:03%0a%3c great so it also there is there is a thing like a prison sentence is or like%0a%3c 1:48:10%0a%3c a fine both of those are reversible like you can get out of person again you can get the money from the fines%0a%3c 1:48:17%0a%3c back you can get your life back like doing a punishment that's in Reverse in Reverse it is a problem in itself%0a%3c 1:48:25%0a%3c oh no I I don't see a [ __ ] problem with that likelike that [ __ ] would who did that measuring in Sweden like he%0a%3c 1:48:32%0a%3c [ __ ] killed all I think it was Sweden all records [ __ ] oh yeah yeah like%0a%3c 1:48:37%0a%3c like that [ __ ] guy right he [ __ ] killed a bunch of [ __ ] kids like he%0a%3c 1:48:43%0a%3c killed a bunch of kids he took their life without their [ __ ] consent well%0a%3c 1:48:50%0a%3c that's also [ __ ] be reversible [ __ ] that guy seriously I do not see a%0a%3c 1:48:56%0a%3c problem we'll say shouldn't have look there are too many people and it is%0a%3c 1:49:02%0a%3c actually quite important important thing yeah that that we come them I hope I do%0a%3c 1:49:09%0a%3c not out to be not using it as a revenge I'd really prone with that because if we use his ass as like a human trial he%0a%3c 1:49:18%0a%3c killed a bunch of kids now he gets the consequence with it which is guess Roger now lab monkey enjoy your stay%0a%3c 1:49:26%0a%3c well it so so that was actually a point that was brought up during the trial%0a%3c 1:49:31%0a%3c like saying like you're not you're not the person that gets to decide for the%0a%3c 1:49:37%0a%3c society how we should he just he and I also want to really fight for those kids%0a%3c 1:49:42%0a%3c to die that's right also and I think that's the far greater punishment for him would have been to look inside the%0a%3c 1:49:48%0a%3c mental asylum yeah so I think I think he wanted to be seen as fully responsible%0a%3c 1:49:55%0a%3c for what he did and yeah there was an argument in the court whether we were he was mentally insane yeah if there's a%0a%3c 1:50:01%0a%3c better lesson that he wants aalam yeah he refused to accept any any accusations%0a%3c 1:50:07%0a%3c of him being mentally unstable he was mentally sane while the game himself%0a%3c 1:50:12%0a%3c said yeah but but her so he himself saying that he is mentally as stable%0a%3c 1:50:19%0a%3c doesn't really qualify as an argument yeah no no no I'm just like that my question that the problem with insane%0a%3c 1:50:25%0a%3c people they don't know that they're insane well the point the point being was he wouldn't accept that as a line of%0a%3c 1:50:30%0a%3c defense from his from his lawyer great so but alright but but but what what%0a%3c 1:50:36%0a%3c what I didn't get to finish was saying that you also got to view it from from%0a%3c 1:50:41%0a%3c like a third third-party perspective so what what honestly our worst punishment%0a%3c 1:50:48%0a%3c like let's say let's say you um you plan to do something and let's say you don't%0a%3c 1:50:54%0a%3c really care much about your life anyway right because a lot of these other people that that I do these kind of%0a%3c 1:51:01%0a%3c things don't value life in the same sense that most people do now what then%0a%3c 1:51:07%0a%3c is the greatest punishment that you robbed someone from all their freedom%0a%3c 1:51:12%0a%3c and essentially force them to live out their life or just end it and it's also%0a%3c 1:51:22%0a%3c the same for someone that's watching them what'swhat's honestly worse watching%0a%3c 1:51:28%0a%3c someone rot away or someone ceasing to exist and you can now use them as a symbol so it's like it's there's a lot%0a%3c 1:51:38%0a%3c of nuances to this well I I'm a simple person I personally think who a person%0a%3c 1:51:46%0a%3c who does that type of [ __ ] does not [ __ ] deserve to bleed my [ __ ] air my initial my initial reaction was yes%0a%3c 1:51:54%0a%3c just like why didn't they just [ __ ] shoot him on the island because that's%0a%3c 1:52:00%0a%3c the point well yeah I'm also doing it an immediate danger to the police officers anymore they can't they kind of also%0a%3c 1:52:07%0a%3c also why shooting him was mean like a good point they didn't know if he was%0a%3c 1:52:13%0a%3c acting alone or not yeah exactly my goodness you always know what's going%0a%3c 1:52:19%0a%3c on but it's so easy right to have the initial reaction of just just just kill%0a%3c 1:52:24%0a%3c the follows yeah but but yeah like as%0a%3c 1:52:29%0a%3c time is going gone on I'm now in the camp of just just just keep him just%0a%3c 1:52:36%0a%3c keep it keep him like an old rag let rot what is his present sentence exactly so I think that something is it said one%0a%3c 1:52:43%0a%3c day so in in origin' is called a footballing which essentially means that%0a%3c 1:52:49%0a%3c he has a sentence of 21 years and he has a minimum period of I believe it's 15%0a%3c 1:52:54%0a%3c years before is even eligible to talk about a reduced sentence we just wanna%0a%3c 1:53:01%0a%3c as the same system in Germany when yeah actually whether you have at least 15%0a%3c 1:53:07%0a%3c years and in especially hard cases at least 25 years listen to this [ __ ]%0a%3c 1:53:14%0a%3c [ __ ] that [ __ ] killed a bunch of photos my girl Maria Marie I'm not no no%0a%3c 1:53:20%0a%3c it doesn't get real at the point if I don't know I I didn't get to finish so the word for balling means that when%0a%3c 1:53:28%0a%3c like the minimum time is spent because a person here isn't a full calendar year right so when the minimum time is spent%0a%3c 1:53:36%0a%3c he now has to sit in front of essentially a new jury which is which%0a%3c 1:53:42%0a%3c consists of like prison personnel lawyers psychiatrists doctors and and so%0a%3c 1:53:52%0a%3c on and they need to evaluate the the quote-unquote candidate or inmate if he%0a%3c 1:53:58%0a%3c is eligible for release and if they deem not eligible he now has to serve a new%0a%3c 1:54:05%0a%3c sentence of five years and after five years this process repeats and it can repeat at invision yes so he can sit and%0a%3c 1:54:14%0a%3c most likely will sit for the revolts like he always join a chat he has of%0a%3c 1:54:19%0a%3c getting out if once he gets all and gets too sick to happy in the prison and even then he%0a%3c 1:54:27%0a%3c will probably be in some kind of special institution yes basically that after 25%0a%3c 1:54:35%0a%3c years as you've served you will get into another kind of prison which is not as strict as the other one and by the way%0a%3c 1:54:43%0a%3c the word for that is also quite close to the Norwegian word it's called survival if you probably same Danish for buying%0a%3c 1:54:50%0a%3c yeah it's probably the exact same word we have traumatic head coaches unite yes%0a%3c 1:54:57%0a%3c we call it a difference here in Allen's what we have to say well Dutch doesn't%0a%3c 1:55:03%0a%3c count because Dutch are weird do you back the Linguistics it was personally%0a%3c 1:55:10%0a%3c no [ __ ] did guide you just use a measure as a guinea pig [ __ ] talking no yeah%0a%3c 1:55:16%0a%3c right right after the case I would have agreed with you I no longer do no [ __ ] I%0a%3c 1:55:23%0a%3c do like it means that the death penalty in German is off the table because of the Constitution literally the first%0a%3c 1:55:30%0a%3c article in our Constitution says that human dignity cannot be taken away from somebody oh you know you know the first%0a%3c 1:55:38%0a%3c so I I have to lock this up again but I'm pretty sure I'm correct in saying yeah I'm looking off the range because%0a%3c 1:55:44%0a%3c seriously because it first it's I'm pretty sure the first the first point on%0a%3c 1:55:50%0a%3c ours is that the king is exempt from all other laws what uh what the [ __ ] well%0a%3c 1:55:57%0a%3c yeah so it is it is actually written in our laws and or Constitution that the%0a%3c 1:56:04%0a%3c king is exempted from all laws so essentially the king I mean obviously%0a%3c 1:56:09%0a%3c that would be overthrown if yeah if the King decided to go on like a murderous%0a%3c 1:56:15%0a%3c rampage in the capital that would obviously be changed but it would be%0a%3c 1:56:20%0a%3c changed after the fact here our King%0a%3c 1:56:26%0a%3c does not have that freedom look if he [ __ ] would do something like that%0a%3c 1:56:31%0a%3c he'll [ __ ] burn yes first german article as human%0a%3c 1:56:38%0a%3c dignity shall be inviolable to respect I'll copy the duty of all state authority the first one in ours is%0a%3c 1:56:45%0a%3c pretty simple if they do just oh this this constitution yeah it applies in the%0a%3c 1:56:51%0a%3c Kingdom of Denmark with a little sexual way to start out well here if he if he%0a%3c 1:56:57%0a%3c tries that [ __ ] it he's done for like he will be roasting well not roasting but%0a%3c 1:57:03%0a%3c chilling in prison for a long [ __ ] time yeah how high is the prison sentence in the Netherlands same exactly%0a%3c 1:57:12%0a%3c the same so at least about 20 years plus prolong well actually if you are%0a%3c 1:57:19%0a%3c convicted of murder there's a good chance you will be walking in 3 14 years%0a%3c 1:57:26%0a%3c yep see sighs where do I find these laws written in normal Norwegian holy [ __ ]%0a%3c 1:57:32%0a%3c this is written in the old girl ha ha ha ha you don't the troubles of having%0a%3c 1:57:39%0a%3c reformed your language so you know micro you might actually be able to read this%0a%3c 1:57:45%0a%3c better than I do because it's almost it's almost Danish yeah it's let's see%0a%3c 1:57:52%0a%3c oh I want to see this as well to see if I can translate it I'm not sure laughs%0a%3c 1:58:02%0a%3c arias follow follow follow follow us lots of [ __ ] for the full of stuff%0a%3c 1:58:08%0a%3c that it means to to to promise or to do as your word like you're not here%0a%3c 1:58:16%0a%3c because have a hell is a promise we'll%0a%3c 1:58:22%0a%3c have we call that Bluff here in the Netherlands all right I can't read%0a%3c 1:58:28%0a%3c anything of that I can I can sort of clean the the meaning out of it%0a%3c 1:58:35%0a%3c follow ever Hama Marcus Erica who would manage some wonderful overflow for Yeldon Nohant Ilhan and lovely%0a%3c 1:58:41%0a%3c oscilloscopes like ha ha ha Niki bacala Karakum like it's just ok the personal climate the%0a%3c 1:58:49%0a%3c the purse the personal make something like a promise has the power to I think%0a%3c 1:58:59%0a%3c it's the person that he has the power to decide when the promises to be repaid or%0a%3c 1:59:07%0a%3c without yeah yeah yeah it's where it's worded so [ __ ] we're doing fingers%0a%3c 1:59:14%0a%3c actually it's a like it's alone yeah the stepped it's that it's just like%0a%3c 1:59:23%0a%3c please I wanted in actual Norwegian it's the own fault for [ __ ] if a [ __ ]%0a%3c 1:59:30%0a%3c [ __ ] fall like reforming your language is also it's also like it%0a%3c 1:59:38%0a%3c contrary to so this is funny I brought this up before because you know how they%0a%3c 1:59:43%0a%3c say that yet the u.s. is a Christian country right which it were seriously its currently not Norway is by law so%0a%3c 1:59:51%0a%3c it's been like yeah I'm not sure about Germany right now because for some%0a%3c 1:59:56%0a%3c reason we still have like the Christian holidays are still national holidays%0a%3c 2:00:02%0a%3c yeah which I'm completely against no Germany is not it's not completely%0a%3c 2:00:07%0a%3c secular that's the problem for example it states that religious teaching in%0a%3c 2:00:13%0a%3c schools is by definition okay but the problem is so that in most times%0a%3c 2:00:21%0a%3c only Christian education is available yeah but I'm pretty sure the German%0a%3c 2:00:27%0a%3c constitution doesn't include the lines which isn't Evangelical Lutheran Church shall be the established Church of%0a%3c 2:00:32%0a%3c Denmark also should be supported by the state well it wouldn't have to line referring to Denmark obviously yeah but%0a%3c 2:00:40%0a%3c then no no I don't think there's something like that that states that the people so everyone it is a fun one the%0a%3c 2:00:47%0a%3c king or in this case the Queen's it really should say the monarch shall be%0a%3c 2:00:53%0a%3c she'll be a member of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in other words the%0a%3c 2:00:59%0a%3c is to have a specific religion yeah same here Qaeda which is kind of [ __ ] up%0a%3c 2:01:05%0a%3c yeah it's it's Lutheran here as well I think we get from Denmark we up yeah um%0a%3c 2:01:12%0a%3c it's just they they thought that Ben Martin like Denmark and Sweden have had%0a%3c 2:01:18%0a%3c a lot of war was and it's to mainly pin about the notary of all over yeah if who%0a%3c 2:01:25%0a%3c wrote lowly we we've all pretty much always been the bottom [ __ ] well that's%0a%3c 2:01:30%0a%3c pretty obvious why because until you basically unser you start oil you have been if you were a fairly poor country%0a%3c 2:01:37%0a%3c which yeah that's why so much of Norwegian where Christine is based on them like it's farmers food%0a%3c 2:01:44%0a%3c she is promised to keep it again cow essentially all of it and fish and fish%0a%3c 2:01:50%0a%3c oh yeah yeah oh so you were so lucky or didn't take the bet because I actually found that dish based on lying mixed%0a%3c 2:01:58%0a%3c with heart oh god you know change in%0a%3c 2:02:05%0a%3c terms of avaria name is always limited how about you [ __ ] people eat%0a%3c 2:02:10%0a%3c something normal like shallow cut something we saw out half of it I just%0a%3c 2:02:16%0a%3c this is pretty normal Oh which country was I think it was%0a%3c 2:02:22%0a%3c Denmark or Sweden or something with it a fermented herring [ __ ] brother LS that%0a%3c 2:02:28%0a%3c Sweden's I'm sorry so sorry yeah how about no like can you guys know%0a%3c 2:02:34%0a%3c that is suppose to like not taste that bad it's just as well as Oahu I just%0a%3c 2:02:40%0a%3c don't eat something that smells like and and also you need it like you need like you needed with raw onion like you read%0a%3c 2:02:47%0a%3c it with other things that will master taste and smell growing in the past%0a%3c 2:02:52%0a%3c hey I don't want to eat something just tastes like my mother's [ __ ] how do I know how I don't want to know but by the%0a%3c 2:03:01%0a%3c way I was wrong i found so 1814 is when norway as the country it is right now%0a%3c 2:03:06%0a%3c was fondling it's all over germany this the 17th of May%0a%3c 2:03:12%0a%3c is our national national day so it I was drawings at the first it's the fifth it%0a%3c 2:03:20%0a%3c says Congress personally Hagen Ikki lost his alarm clock s Antalya tempore legal hogs Ward which essentially means that%0a%3c 2:03:27%0a%3c you cannot touch the king as a person and all responsibility is by his own%0a%3c 2:03:32%0a%3c judgment um that's one of those things were like%0a%3c 2:03:37%0a%3c but yeah but it's like he went out and killed someone ya know he would get punished yeah he%0a%3c 2:03:44%0a%3c would get punished in that that law would be would be changed but if there a mechanism to punish him yes%0a%3c 2:03:51%0a%3c oh yeah thanks a lot you can also I think you can remove his royal guidance%0a%3c 2:03:58%0a%3c yeah but that's not another like [ __ ] bureaucracy hell I mean I mean%0a%3c 2:04:04%0a%3c technically you would always like ELISA in Denmark we could theoretically just like have a vote and change the%0a%3c 2:04:11%0a%3c constitution and like from one day like on a certain date life several like the%0a%3c 2:04:18%0a%3c Royals would stop the stopping roll and%0a%3c 2:04:24%0a%3c dude okay so out of the first ten laws as you say is the ten commandments right%0a%3c 2:04:30%0a%3c a law three four five six seven eight%0a%3c 2:04:39%0a%3c nine and ten including eleven twelve%0a%3c 2:04:45%0a%3c thirteen fourteen yeah okay so out of%0a%3c 2:04:50%0a%3c the first 15 law three to fourteen is%0a%3c 2:04:56%0a%3c all about the king yeah I'm just going to go ctrl F and%0a%3c 2:05:02%0a%3c just search King and see how many how many times are you like in almost every%0a%3c 2:05:07%0a%3c law yeah okay excluding the first one because that it says Kingdom but but so%0a%3c 2:05:14%0a%3c forty forty nine forty nine places in the same Constitution mentions King oh%0a%3c 2:05:21%0a%3c it's a hell of a lot more than that okay okay okay okay two of them also like to end up making%0a%3c 2:05:28%0a%3c but but many of them at least in the Norwegian one is it is essentially just like this does not apply for the king%0a%3c 2:05:37%0a%3c it's kind of weird that it's still Hector helling it's still like cleaning Li like I'm%0a%3c 2:05:44%0a%3c assuming by King here they mean monarch because otherwise all of these laws%0a%3c 2:05:49%0a%3c wouldn't apply because we don't have a king at the moment so our first law is%0a%3c 2:05:56%0a%3c actually Camilla Camilla got ripped asunder you diddly oh you having it again that's it feelings from an instant get all in%0a%3c 2:06:03%0a%3c Caracas which yeah means it's it's free independent unda visible and independent%0a%3c 2:06:10%0a%3c and the government will have a limited power and we'll have a monarchy that%0a%3c 2:06:17%0a%3c passes by blood essentially that's the first rule and then the second law is%0a%3c 2:06:23%0a%3c that that our expose our second so yes and this is the second is that our our%0a%3c 2:06:30%0a%3c foundation for values will be our Christian and humanitarian like Shaw%0a%3c 2:06:37%0a%3c pretty weird considering to do those two things are kind of actually exclusive if%0a%3c 2:06:43%0a%3c you go by guys without that guys I'm going to close the Hangout at least%0a%3c 2:06:49%0a%3c dreaming yeah we can discuss more if you want but there's no point in continuing%0a%3c 2:06:55%0a%3c doing alias and YouTube so for everybody who's still here thanks for watching see%0a%3c 2:07:00%0a%3c you soon hopefully or not it depends by%0a\ No newline at end of file%0a---%0a> My
