csum=[[essential oil]]s in [[lanolin]] seemed to have caused this in me along with eating lots of [[sulfur]] and having [[hydrogen sulfide]] producing bacteria in the gut from eating lots of [[garlic]] and [[onion]].  Hives are also linked to sulfur containing drugs [[ https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hives|#]] I know this diet caused a [[campylobacter]] overgrowth and when treating with [[ginger]] noticed strong [[neuropathy]] [[pins and needles]] feeling so campy might have been part of the culprit.  Strongyloides dieoff from the essential oil lanolin could also have contributed. Though the hives subsided over time this has left me suseptable to allergy to [[poison ivy]] which zi never was before, and probably other allergens.
