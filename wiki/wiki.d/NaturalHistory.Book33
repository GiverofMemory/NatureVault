(1.) — METALS. %0a%0a"We are now about to speak of metals, of actual wealth, 1 ' %0athe standard of comparative value, objects for which we dili- %0agently search, within the earth, in numerous ways. In one %0aplace, for instance, we undermine it for the purpose of obtaining %0ariches, to supply the exigencies of life, searching for either %0agold or silver, electrum 2 or copper. 3 In another place, to %0asatisfy the requirements of luxury, our researches extend to %0agems and pigments, with which to adorn our fingers 4 and the %0awalls of our houses : while in a third place, we gratify Our %0arash propensities by a search for iron, which, amid wars and %0acarnage, is deemed more acceptable even than gold. We trace %0aout all the veins of the earth, and yet, living upon it, under- %0amined as it is beneath our feet, are astonished that it should oc- %0acasionally cleave asunder or tremble : as though, forsooth, these %0a%0a1 We now enter upon the Sixth division of Pliny's work, containing an %0aaccount of mineral substances of all descriptions. — Dr. Bostock. %0a%0al * " Ipsae opes." The metals were looked upon by the ancients as the %0aonly true riches. It is in this sense that Ovid says, Metam. B. i. : " Effo- %0adiuntur opes, irritamenta malorum." Pliny applies the term " pretia re- %0arum" to metals, as forming the unit of value. %0a%0a2 Electrum is described in c. 23, as gold mixed with a certain quan- %0atity of silver. The word " electrum " is also used to signify amber, as in %0aB. iii. c. 30. — B. %0a%0a3 ".5Ss ;" by " aes" is here probably meant copper, as the author is speaking %0aof what is dug out of the earth ; it is more fully described in the first two %0aChapters of the next Book. According to the analysis of Klaproth, the %0ates of the ancients, when employed in works of art, cutting instruments, %0astatues, vases, &c, was the " bronze " of the moderns, a mixture of copper %0aand tin, in which the proportion of tin varied, from a little more than 2 %0ato 1.14 per cent, according as the object was to procure a flexible or a %0ahard substance. Agricola speaks of " aes" as synonymous with "cuprum," %0aand Pliny will be found several times in the present Book, speaking of %0a"aes Cyprium," meaning probably the finest kind of copper, and that with- %0aout alloy. — B. %0a%0a4 Pliny has already referred to this topic in B. ii. c. 63.— B. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 2.] %0a%0a%0a%0aGOLD. %0a%0a%0a%0a69 %0a%0a%0a%0asigns could be any other than expressions of the indignation %0afelt by our sacred parent ! We penetrate into her entrails, and %0aseek for treasures in the abodes even of the Manes, 4 * as though %0aeach spot we tread upon were not sufficiently bounteous and %0afertile for us ! %0a%0aAnd yet, amid all this, we are far from making remedies the %0aobject of our researches : and how few in thus delving into the %0aearth have in view the promotion of medicinal knowledge ! For %0ait is upon her surface, in fact, that she has presented us with %0athese substances, equally with the cereals, bounteous and ever %0aready, as she is, in supplying us with all things for our benefit ! %0aIt is what is concealed from our view, what is sunk far be- %0aneath her surface, objects, in fact, of no rapid formation, 6 that %0aurge us to our ruin, that send us to tbe very depths of hell. %0aAs the mind ranges in vague speculation, let us only consider, %0aproceeding through all ages, as these operations are, when will %0abe the end of thus exhausting the earth, and to what point %0awill avarice finally penetrate ! How innocent, how happy, how %0atruly delightful even would life be, if we were to desire no- %0athing but what is to be found upon the face of the earth ; in a %0aword, nothing but what is provided ready to our hands ! %0a%0aCHAT. 2. GOLD. %0a%0aGold is dug out of the earth, and, in close proximity to it, %0achrysocolla, 6 a substance which, that it may appear all the %0amore precious, still retains the name 7 which it has borrowed %0afrom gold. 8 It was not enough for us to have discovered one %0abane for the human race, but we must set a value too upon the %0avery humours of gold. 9 While avarice, too, was on the search %0a%0a*" Or shades below. 5 " Ilia quae non nascuntur repente." %0a%0as •' Chrysocolla" is fully described in Chapter 26 of this Book. — B. %0a" Meaning "gold glue," or "gold solder." %0a%0a8 There is considerable variation in the text of this passage, as found in %0athe different editions. In that of Dalechamps, the Variorum, and those of %0aDe Lae't and Sillig, the sentence concludes with the words " nomen ex auro %0acustodiens;" while in those of Valpy, Lemaire, Poinsinet, Ajasson, and %0aothers, we find substituted for them the words, "Non natura," " Nomen %0anatnra," " Nomine natura," or "Nomen naturam." — B. The first reading %0ais warranted by the Bamberg MS. %0a%0a» " Auri sanies." More properly speaking, " the corrupt matter dis- %0acharged by gold." See Chapter 26. %0a%0a%0a%0a70 %0a%0a%0a%0aplint's natural histoet. %0a%0a%0a%0a[Book XXXIII. %0a%0a%0a%0afor silver, it congratulated itself upon the discovery of miuiuni, lc %0aand devised a use to be made of this red earth. %0a%0aAlas for the prodigal inventions of man ! in how many %0aways have we augmented the value of things !" In addition %0ato the standard value of these metals, the art of painting lends %0aits aid, and we have rendered gold and silver still more costly %0aby the art of chasing them. Man has learned how to challenge %0aboth Nature and art to become the incitements to vice ! His %0avery cups he has delighted to engrave with libidinous subjects, %0aand" he takes pleasure in drinking from vessels of obscene form ! 1J %0aBut in lapse of time, the metals passed out of fashion, and %0amen began to make no account of them ; gold and silver, in %0afact, became too common. From this same earth we have ex- %0atracted vessels of murrhine 13 and vases of crystal, 13 * objects %0athe very fragility of which is considered to enhance their value. %0aIn fact, it has come to be looked upon as a proof of opulence, %0aand as quite the glory of luxury, to possess that which may be %0airremediably destroyed in an instant. Nor was even this %0aenough ; — we now drink from out of a mass of gems, 11 and we %0aset our goblets with smaragdi ; 15 we take delight in possessing %0athe wealth of India, as the promoter of intoxication, and gold %0ais now nothing more than a mere accessory. 16 %0a%0a10 " Minium " is treated of in Chapter 36 of this Book. — B. %0a%0a11 "Pretia rerum." The value of the raw material. %0a%0a12 Pliny here refers both to the art of producing figures in relief on drink- %0aing vessels made of the precious metals, and also of giving them particular %0aforms. A well-known line of Juvenal, Sat. ii. 1. 95, affords a striking %0aillustration of the depraved taste which existed in his time. — B. Lampri- %0adius also speaks of vessels of silver " denied with representations of a most %0alibidinous character ;" and Capitolinus speaks of " phallovitroboli," glass %0adrinking vessels shaped like a phallus. %0a%0an "Murrhina" or "myrrhina," are described in B. xxxvii. c. 8; they %0awere, perhaps, onyxes or opals, though possibly the term was not strictly %0aconfined to these substances, but signified any transparent minerals, that %0aexhibited a variety of colours. Salmasius, however, ridicules the idea of %0atheir being onyxes, and is of opinion that these vessels were made of porce- %0alain ; Exer. Plin..p. 144.— B. 13 « See B. xxxvii. c. 9. %0a%0au He alludes to the cups known as " chrysendeta," adorned with cir- %0aclets of gold, exquisite chasings, and groups of precious stones.

WHAT "WAS THR F1KST RECOMMENDATION OF GOLD. %0a%0a"Would that gold could have been banished for ever from %0athe earth, accursed by universal report, 17 as some of the most %0acelebrated writers have expressed themselves, reviled by the %0areproaches of the best of men, and looked upon as discovered %0aonly for the ruin of mankind. How much more happy the %0aage when things themselves were bartered for one another ; as %0awas the case in the times of the Trojan war, if we are to be- %0alieve what Homer says. For, in this way, in my opinion, was %0acommerce then carried on for the supply of the necessaries of %0alife. Some, he tells us, would make their purchases by bartering %0aox-hides, and others by bartering iron or the spoil which they %0ahad taken from the enemy : 18 and yet he himself, already an %0aadmirer of gold, was so far aware of the relative value of tilings, %0athat Glaucus, he informs us, exchanged his arms of gold, valued %0aat one hundred oxen, for those of Diomedes, which were worth %0abut nine. 19 Proceeding upon the same system of barter, many %0aof the fines imposed by ancient laws, at Rome even, were %0alevied in cattle, 20 [and not in money]. %0a%0aCHAP. 4. THE OBIGIN OF GOLD KINGS. %0a%0aThe worst crime against mankind was committed by him %0awho was the first to put a ring upon his fingers: and yet we %0aare not informed, by tradition, who it was that first did so. For %0aas to all the stories told about Prometheus, I look upon them as %0autterly fabulous, although I am aware that the ancients used %0ato represent him with a ring of iron : it was their intention, %0ahowever, to signify a chain thereby, and not an ornament. %0aAs to the ring of Midas, 21 which, upon the collet being turned %0a%0a17 " Sacrum famae." This is the reading given by the Bamberg MS. %0ain substitution for " aurum, sacra fames" and other readings of a similar %0anature, in which Pliny was thought by the commentators to allude to the %0afamous lines of Virgil — %0a%0a" Quid non mortalia pectora cogis, %0aAuri sacra fames !" %0aHad he alluded to the passage of Virgil, it is not probable that he would %0ahave used the expression in the plural, " celeberrinii auctores." %0a%0a18 II. B. vii. 11. 472-5. — B. 19 II. B. vi. 1. 236. %0a%0a20 We may infer that this was the reason why the figure of an ox or %0aother animal was impressed on the earliest Boman coins. — B. %0a%0a21 As Ilardouin remarks, ''This story is told by others, of Gyges, and %0anot of Midas." He refers to Cicero, De Off. B. iii. c. 9, in confirmation of %0ahis assertion. — B. Both Gygcs and Midas were noted for their wealth. %0a%0a%0a%0a72 %0a%0a%0a%0apliny's natural history. %0a%0a%0a%0a[Book XXXIII. %0a%0a%0a%0ainwards, conferred invisibility upon the wearer, who is there %0athat must, not admit, perforce, that this story is even still %0amore fabulous ? It was the hand, aud a sinister 22 hand, too, in %0aevery sense, that first brought gold into such high repute : not %0aa Roman hand, however, for upon that it was the practice to %0awear a ring of iron only, and solely as an indication of war- %0alike prowess. %0a%0aAs to the usage followed by the Koman kings, it is not easy %0ato pronounce an opinion : the statue of Romulus in the Capitol %0awears no ring, nor does any other statue — not that of L. Brutus %0aeven — with the sole exception of those of Nuina and Servius %0aTullius. I am surprised at this absence of the ring, in the %0acase of the Tarquinii more particularly, seeing that they were %0aoriginally from Greece, 22 * a country from which the use of %0agold rings was first introduced ; though even at the present %0aday the people of Lacedaemon are in the habit of wearing rings %0amade of iron. Tarquinius Priscus, however, it is well known, %0awas the first who presented his son with the golden bulla, 23 on %0athe occasion of his slaying an enemy before he had laid aside the %0apraetexta ; 24 from which period the custom of wearing the bulla %0ahas been continued, a distinction confined to the children of %0athose who have served in the cavalry, those of other persons %0asimply wearing a leather thong. 25 Such being the case, I am %0athe more surprised that the statue of this Tarquinius should %0abe without a ring. %0a%0aAnd yet, with reference to the very name of the ring, I find %0athat there has been considerable uncertainty. That given to %0a%0a22 " Sinistra." The play here upon the word "sinister" cannot he so %0awell transferred into the English language ; but it hears reference to the %0adouble meaning of the word, " on the left hand," and " unlucky," " i II— %0aomened," or, as we say " sinister." "We may remark, that rings were %0avery generally employed by the Romans, not merely as ornaments, but as %0aindications of office and rank. — B. %0a%0a22 * From Corinth, it was said : Damaratus of Corinth being the father of %0athe first Tarquin. See B. xxxv. c. 5. %0a%0a23 On the subject of " Bullae," golden balls, worn by the children of the %0anobles, see Dr. Smith's Diet. Antiq. p. 168. — B. %0a%0a24 As to the " Toga praetexta," see B. viii. c. 74. %0a%0a25 " Lorum." This word literally signifies a leather strap or thong, and %0aPliny is supposed by Hardouin to mean simply, that, in this latter case %0athe strap was worn without the bulla, which was in other cases attached to %0ait. Juvenal, Sat. v. 1. 164, speaks of the " lorum " of the children of the %0apoor. — B. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 4.1 %0a%0a%0a%0aTHE OEIGIN OF GOLD RINGS. %0a%0a%0a%0a73 %0a%0a%0a%0ait originally by the Greeks is derived from the finger ; 26 while %0aoar ancestors styled it " ungulus ;" 27 and in later times both %0aGreeks and Latins have given it the name of " symbolum." 28 %0aFor a great length of time, it is quite clear, not even the %0altoman senators wore rings of gold : for rings were given, and %0aat the public expense, to those only who were about to proceed %0aon an embassy to foreign nations, the reason being, I suppose, %0abecause men of highest rank among foreign nations were per- %0aceived to be thus distinguished. Nor was it the practice for %0aany person to wear these rings, except those who for this reason %0ahad received them at the public expense ; and in most in- %0astances, it was without this distinction that the Roman generals %0acelebrated their public triumphs. 29 For whereas an Etruscan %0acrown 30 of gold was supported from behind over the head of %0athe victor, he himself, equally with the slave probably, who %0awas so supporting the crown, had nothing but a ring of %0airon upon his finger. 31 It was in this manner that C. Marius %0acelebrated his triumph over Jugurtha ; and he never as- %0asumed 32 the golden ring, it is said, until the period of his %0athird consulship. 33 Those, too, who had received golden rings %0aon the occasion of an embassy, only wore them when in public, %0aresuming the ring of iron when in their houses. It is in pur- %0asuance of this custom that even at the present day, an iron %0aring 34 is sent by way of present to a woman when betrothed, %0aand that, too, without any stone in it. %0a%0aFor my own part, I do not find that any rings were used in %0athe days of the Trojan "War; at all events, Homer nowhere %0a%0a26 AaKTvXtov, from SuktvXoq, a "finger." %0a%0a27 Festus says that this was the Oscan name for a ring. It would %0aappear to be allied to the word " unguis," which means a nail of the %0afinger or toe, and would perhaps signify a " nail ornament." %0a%0a28 As meaning a seal or signet, lor which purpose, as we shall find ex* %0aplained in the sequel, the ring was used. %0a%0ai9 This seems to be the meaning of " Vulgoque sic triumph abant." %0a%0a30 As to these crowns, see 15. xxi. c. 4. %0a%0a31 As to some other particulars connected with this usage, see the end %0aof B. xxviii. c. 7. %0a%0a32 And yet, as Hardouin remarks, before his time, when Scipio was %0abesieging Carthage, the bodies of the Eoman tribunes, when selected for %0aburial by Ilasdrubal, were distinguished by their rings of gold. The %0aobject of Marius, no doubt, was to ingratiate himself with the upper classes. %0a%0a33 a.u.o. 651. %0a%0a3 * Known as the "anulus pronubus," or "engaged ring," according to %0aDalechamps, %0a%0a%0a%0a74 %0a%0a%0a%0apliny's natural iiistoky. [Book XXX III. %0a%0a%0a%0amakes mention of tliem ; for although he speaks of the practice %0aof sending tablets 35 by way of letter, 36 of clothes and gold and %0asilver plate being kept laid up in chests, 37 still he gives us to %0aunderstand that they were kept secure by the aid of a knot %0atied fast, and not under a seal impressed by a ring. He does %0anot inform us too, that when the chiefs drew lots to ascertain %0awhich one of them should reply to the challenge 38 of the %0aenemj'-, they made any use of rings 39 for the purpose ; and when %0ahe enumerates the articles that were manufactured at the %0aforge 40 of the gods, he speaks of this as being the origin 41 of %0afibulae 42 and other articles of female ornament, such as ear- %0arings for example, but does not make any mention of rings. %0a%0a43 Whoever it was that first introduced the use of rings, he %0adid so not without hesitation ; for he placed this ornament on %0athe left hand, the hand which is generally concealed, 44 whereas, %0aif he had been sure of its being an honourable distinction, it %0awould have been made more conspicuous upon the right. And if %0aany one should raise the objection that this would have acted %0aas an impediment to the right hand, I can only say that the %0ausage in more recent times fortifies my opinion, and that the %0ainconvenience of wearing rings on the left hand would have %0abeen still greater, seeing that it is with the left hand that the %0a%0a3i " Codicillos."

He alludes to the forge of Vulcan, described in %0athe Eighteenth Book of the Iliad, 1. 400, et seq. %0a%0a41 This seems to be the meaning of " In primordio factitassc." %0a%0a42 The " fibula?" were the brooches of the ancients, consisting of a pin, %0aand of a curved portion furnished with a hook. See Dr. Smith's I»ict. %0aAntiq. p. 417. %0a%0a43 As the meaning of this passage has been the subject of much discus- %0asion with commentators, we give it in full, as found in the Edition of %0aSillig. " Et quisquis primus instituit, cunctanter id fecit, hevis manibus %0alatentibusque induit, cum, si honos securus fuisset, dextra merit ostentan- %0adus. Quodsi impedimentum potuit in eo aliquod intelligi, etiam serior is %0ausus argumentum est, et majus in laeva fuisset, qua scutum capitur." %0aSillig is of opinion that Pliny is here alluding to the reason given by Ateius %0aCapito (quoted in Macrobius, Saturn. B. vii. c. 13), for wearing the ring %0aon the left hand. It was so worn, he says, from an apprehension that %0athe precious stone with which it was set, might receive injury from the %0acontinual use made of the right hand. %0a%0a44 Under the folds of the toga. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 5.] %0a%0a%0a%0aGOLD POSSESSED BY THE ANCIENTS. %0a%0a%0a%0a75 %0a%0a%0a%0ashield is held. "We find mention made too, in Homer, 45 of men %0awearing gold plaited with the hair ; and hence it is that I am %0aat a loss to say whether the practice first originated with %0afemales. %0a%0aCHAP. 5. THE QUANTITY OF GOLD POSSESSED BY THE ANCIENTS. %0a%0aAt Rome, for a long period of time, the quantity of gold %0awas but very small. At all events, after the capture of the %0aCity by the Gauls, when peace was about to be purchased, not %0amore than one thousand pounds' weight of gold could be col- %0alected. I am by no means unaware of the fact that in the %0athird 46 consulship of Pompeius there was lost from the throne %0aof Jupiter Capitolinus two thousand pounds' weight of gold, %0aoriginally placed there by Camillus ; a circumstance which has %0aled most persons to suppose, that two thousand pounds' weight %0awas the quantity then collected. But in reality, this excess %0aof one thousand pounds was contributed from the spoil taken %0afrom the Gauls, amplified as it was by the gold of which they %0ahad stripped the temples, in that part of the City which they %0ahad captured. %0a%0aThe story of Torquatus, 47 too, is a proof that the Gauls were %0ain the habit of wearing ornaments of gold when engaged in %0acombat ; 48 from which it would appear that the sum taken %0afrom the Gauls themselves, and the amount of which they had %0apillaged the temples, were only equal to the amount of gold %0acollected for the ransom, and no more ; and this is what was %0areally meant by the response given by the augurs, that Jupiter %0aCapitolinus had rendered again the ransom twofold. 49 As we %0a%0a45 II. B. xvii. 1. 52. %0a%0a46 The reading in most MSS. is the "fourth consulship." This, how- %0aever, is an error which has been rectified by the Bamberg and some other %0aMSS. Pompey was but thrice consul. M. Crassus was the person generally %0aaccused of the act of robbery here alluded to. %0a%0a41 Who took the golden tore (torques) from the Gaul whom he slew ; %0awhence his name. 48 " Cum auro pugnare solitos." %0a%0a49 " Quod equidem in augurio intellectum est, cum Capitolinus duplum %0areddidisset." The meaning of this passage is obscure, and cannot with %0acertainty be ascertained. Holland renders it, " To the light and know- %0aledge whereof we come by means of revelation from Augurie, which gave %0aus to understand, that Jupiter Capitolinus had rendered again the foresaid %0aBiimme in duple proportion." Littre gives a similar translation. Ajasson %0atranslates it, " This, at least, is what we may presume, from the fact of %0athere being discovered double the amount expected ;" following the ex- %0aplanation given by Hardouin. %0a%0a%0a%0a76 %0a%0a%0a%0aplint's natural history. %0a%0a%0a%0a[Book XXXIII. %0a%0a%0a%0awere just now speaking on the subject of rings, it may be as %0awell to add, by way of passing remark, that upon the officer w %0ain charge of the Temple of Jupiter Capitolinus being arrested, %0ahe broke the stone of his ring between his teeth, 81 and expired %0aupon the spot, thus putting an end to all possibility of dis- %0acovering the perpetrator of the theft. %0a%0aIt appears, therefore, that in the year of the City 364, when %0aRome was captured by the Gauls, there was but two thousand %0apounds' weight of gold, at the very most ; and this, too, at a %0aperiod when, according to the returns of the census, there were %0aalready one hundred and fifty-two thousand five hundred and %0aseventy-three free citizens in it. In this same city, too, three %0ahundred and seven years later, the gold which C. Marius the %0ayounger 53 conveyed to Praeneste from the Temple of the Capitol %0awhen in flames, and all the other shrines, amounted to thirteen %0athousand pounds' weight, such being the sum that figured in the %0ainscriptions at the triumph of Sylla ; on which occasion it was %0adisplayed in the procession, as well as six thousand pounds' %0aweight of silver. The same Sylla had, the day before, dis- %0aplayed in his triumph fifteen thousand pounds' weight of gold, %0aand one hundred and fifteen thousand pounds' weight of silver, %0athe fruit of all his other victories. %0a%0aCHAP. 6. THE BIGHT OF WEARING GOLD RINGS. %0a%0aIt does not appear that rings were in common use before the %0atime of Cneius Flavius, the son of Annius. This Flavius was %0athe first to publish a table 63 of the days for pleading, 64 which %0atill then the populace had to ascertain each day from a few %0a%0a50 The " aedituus," or " temple keeper." See B. xxxvi. 4. %0a%0a51 Beneath which there was poison concealed, Hardouin says. Han- %0anibal killed himself in a similar manner; also Demosthenes, as mentioned %0ain the next Chapter. %0a%0a82 The adopted son of the great Marius. This event happened in his %0aconsulship, b.c. 82. After his defeat by Sylla at Sacriportus, he re- %0atired into the fortified town of Praeneste, where he had deposited the %0atreasures of the Capitoline temple. The temple, after this conflagration, %0awas rebuilt by order of Sylla. %0a%0a83 Called the " Fasti ;" probably because this was the first word of the %0atitle. %0a%0a54 "Dies fasti." These were the days on which the courts sat, and the %0aPraetor, who was the chief judge, gave his decisions.

Pcetilius and %0aDomitius, whose fathers respectively were of consular rank. 60 %0aThe additional honour was also conferred on Flavius, of making %0ahim tribune of the people at the same time, a thing which oc- %0acasioned such a degree of indignation, that, as we find stated in %0athe more ancient Annals, " the rings 61 were laid aside !" %0a%0aMost persons, however, are mistaken in the supposition that %0aon this occasion the members of the equestrian order did the %0asame : for it is in consequence of these additional words, " the %0aphalerae, 62 too, were laid aside as well," that the name of the %0aequestrian order was added. These rings, too, as the Annuls %0atell us, were laid aside by the nobility, and not 63 by the whole %0abody of the senate. This event took place in the consulship %0aof P. Sempronius and P.

Not even in those days, however, %0adid all the senators possess gold rings, seeing that, in the %0amemory of our grandsires, many personages who had even %0afilled the praetorship, wore rings of iron to the end of their %0alives; Calpurnius, 72 for example, as Fenestella tells us, and %0aManilius, who had been legatus to Caius Marius in the Ju- %0agurthine War.

Neither in the countries of the East, 74 nor %0ain Egypt, is any use made of seals, the people heing content %0awith simple writing only. 75 %0a%0aIn this, as in every other case, luxury has introduced various %0afashions, either by adding to rings gems of exquisite brilliancy, %0aand so loading the fingers with whole revenues, as we shall %0ahave further occasion to mention in our Book on Gems ; 76 or %0aelse by engraving them with various devices : so that it is in %0aone instance the workmanship, in another the material, that %0aconstitutes the real value of the ring. Then again, in the %0acase of other gems, luxury has deemed it no less than sacrilege %0ato make a mark 77 even upon them, and has caused them to be set %0awhole, that no one may suppose that the ring was ever intended %0ato be employed as a signet. In other instances, luxury has %0awilled that certain stones, on the side even that is concealed by %0athe finger, should not 78 be closed in with gold, thus making %0agold of less account than thousands of tiny pebbles. On the %0aother hand again, many persons will admit of no gems being %0aset in their rings, but impress their seal with the gold 79 itself, %0aan invention which dates from the reign of Claudius Caesar. %0aAt the present day, too, the very slaves even, incase their iron %0arings with gold (while other articles belonging to them, they %0adecorate with pure gold), 80 a licence which first originated in %0athe Isle of Samothrace, 81 as the name given to the invention %0aclearly shows. %0a%0a74 This is an erroneous assertion, both as to the East, and as to Egypt. %0aSee instances to the contrary in Genesis, c. xli. v. 42 ; and in Esther, c. iii. %0averses 10, 12, and c. viii. verses 2, 8, 10. %0a%0a75 " Literis contenta solis." %0a%0a74 The Thirty-seventh Hook.

See B. xxxvii. c. 1. %0a%0a13 A fashion much followed at the present day. %0a%0a19 This also is a not uncommon fashion at the present day. %0a%0a80 From the "Trinummus" of Plautus, A. iv. s. 4, we learn that the ring %0aworn by slaves was called " condalium." From the " Truculentus" of Plau- %0atus we learn also that these rings were sometimes made of bronze. The %0a"jus nnuli," or right of wearing a gold ring, was never conceded to slaves. %0a%0a81 See B. iv. c. 23. In the Origines of Isidorus Hispalensis, B. xix. c. %0a32, we find mention made of " A Samothracian gold ring, with an iron %0abezil, so called from the place of its invention." Pliny has already made %0a%0a%0a%0aSO %0a%0a%0a%0aPLINY'S NAitTKAL HISTORY. [Boik XXXITT. %0a%0a%0a%0aIt was the custom at first to wear rings on a single finger'' 2 %0aonly, the one, namely, that is next to the little finger ; and this %0awe see the case in the statues of Jfuma and Servius Tullius %0aIn later times, it became the practice to put rings on the finger %0anext to the thumb, even in the case of the statues of the gods ; %0aand more recently, again, it has been the fashion to wear them %0aupon the little finger 83 as well. Among the peoples of Gallia %0aand Britannia, the middle finger, it is said, is used for this pur- %0apose. At the present day, however, among us, this is the only %0aringer that is excepted, all the others being loaded with rings, %0asmaller rings even being separately adapted for the smaller %0ajoints of the fingers. Some there are who heap several rings %0aupon the little finger alone ; while others, again, wear but one %0aring upon this finger, the ring that sets a seal upon the signet- %0aring itself, this last being kept carefully shut up as an object %0aof rarity, too precious to be worn in common use, and only to %0abe taken from the cabinet 31 as from a sanctuary. And thus is %0athe wearing of a single ring upon the little finger no more %0athan an ostentatious advertisement that the owner has property %0aof a more precious nature under seal at home ! %0a%0aSome, too, make a parade of the weight of their rings, while %0ato others it is quite a labour 84 to wear more than one at a time: %0asome, in their solicitude for the safety of their gems, make the %0ahoop of gold tinsel, and fill it with a lighter material than gold, %0athinking thereby to diminish the risks of a fall. 86 Others, again, %0afre in the habit of inclosing poisons beneath the stones of %0aheir rings, and so wear them as instruments of death ; De- %0amosthenes, for instance, that greatest of the orators of Greece. 87 %0aAnd then, besides, how many of the crimes that are stimulated %0aby cupidity, are committed through the instrumentality of %0aallusion to the luxurious habits of the slaves, in B. xiii. c. 4 ■ and B. %0axviii. c. 2 ; a subject upon which Juvenal enlarges in his Third Satire. %0a%0a82 The reasons are mentioned by Ateius Capito, as quoted by Macrobius, %0aSaturnal.

At the present day, on the %0acontrary, our very food even and our drink have to be preserved %0afrom theft 89 through the agency of the ring : a result owing to %0athose legions of slaves, those throngs of foreigners which are %0aintroduced into our houses, multitudes so numerous that we %0arequire the services of a nomenclator 90 even, to tell us the %0anames of our own servants. Very different was it in the times %0aof our forefathers, when each person possessed a single servant %0aonly, one of his master's own lineage, called Marcipor or %0aLucipor, 91 from his master's name, as the case might be, and %0ataking all his meals with him in common ; when, too, there %0awas no occasion for taking precautions at home by keeping a %0awatch upon the domestics. But at the present day, we not %0aonly procure dainties which are sure to be pilfered, but hands %0ato pilfer them as well ; and so far is it from being sufficient to %0ahave the very keys sealed, that the signet-ring is often taken %0afrom off the owner's finger while he is overpowered with sleep %0aor lying on his death-bed. 93 %0a%0aIndeed the most important transactions of life are now made %0ato depend upon this instrument, though at what period this first %0abegan to be the case, I am at a loss to say. It would appear, %0ahowever, so far as foreign nations are concerned, that we may %0aadmit the importance attached to it, from the days of Poly- %0acrates, 93 the tyrant of Samos, whose favourite ring, after being %0a%0a88 He alludes, probably, to forgeries perpetrated through the agency of %0afalse signets. %0a%0a*>'■> Hautus, Cicero, Horace, and Martial, each in his own age, bears %0atestimony to the truth of this statement. %0a%0a90 Or remembrancer ; a slave whose duty it was to remind his master of %0athe name of each member of his household ; see B. xxix. c. 8. Athenaeus, %0aB. vi., speaks of as many as twenty thousand slaves belonging to one %0ahousehold.

Macro, to avoid any unpleasant results in the way of punishment, %0acaused the emperor to be smothered with the pillows and bedclothes. %0a%0a93 This famous and somewhat improbable story of the ring of Polycrates %0ais told by Valerius Maximus, B. vi. c. 9 ; Herodotus, B. iii. ; and Cicero, %0aDe Finibus, B. iv.

The use of the ring must, of necessity, %0ahave become greatly extended with the increase of usury ; %0aone proof of which is, the usage still prevalent among the %0alower classes, of whipping off the ring 95 the moment a simple %0acontract is made ; a practice which takes its date, no doubt, %0afrom a period when there was no more expeditious method of %0agiving an earnest on closing a bargain. We may therefore %0avery safely conclude, that though money was first introduced %0aamong us, the use of rings was introduced very shortly after. %0aOf money, I shall shortly have occasion to speak further. 96 %0a%0aCHAP. 7. THE DECFJRIES OP THE JUDGES. %0a%0aRings, as soon as they began to be commonly worn, distin- %0aguished the second order from the plebeians, in the same %0amanner as the use of the tunic 97 distinguished the senate hem %0athose who only wore the ring. Still, however, this last dis- %0atinction was introduced at a later period only, and we find it %0astated by writers that the public heralds 98 even were formerly %0ain the habit of wearing the tunic with the purple laticlave ; %0athe father of Lucius JElius Stilo," for instance, from whom %0ahis son received the cognomen of " Prajconinus," in conse- %0aquence of his father's occupation as a herald. But the use of %0arings, no doubt, was the distinguishing mark of a third and %0aintermediate brder, between the plebeians and the senators ; %0aand the title of " eques," originally derived from the posses- %0asion of a war-horse, 1 is given at the present day as an indica- %0ation of a certain amount of income. This, however, is of %0acomparatively recent introduction; for when the late Emperor %0aAugustus made his regulations for the decuries, 2 the greater %0apart of the members thereof were persons who wore iron rings, %0aand these bore the name, not of "equites," but of "judices," %0a%0a94 He was crucified by Oroetes, the Persian satrap of Sardis. %0a%0a95 " Anulo exsiliente." so i n Chapter 13 of this Book. %0a97 The laticlave tunic.

These decuries, too, were themselves distinguished by %0aseveral denominations — " tribunes 5 of the treasury," "selecti," 6 %0aand "judices :" in addition to whom, there were the persons %0astyled the " nine hundred," 7 chosen from all the decuries for %0athe purpose of keeping the voting- boxes at the comitia. From %0athe ambitious adoption, however, of some one of these names, %0agreat divisions ensued in this order, one person styling himself %0aa member of the nine hundred, another one of the selecti, and %0aa third a tribune of the treasury. %0a%0aCUAP. 8. PARTICULARS CONNECTED WITH THE EQUESTRIAN ORDER. %0a%0aAt length, however, in the ninth 8 year of the reign of the %0aEmperor Tiberius, the equestrian order was united in a single %0abody ; and a decree was passed, establishing to whom belonged %0athe right of wearing the ring, in the consulship of C. Asinius %0aPollio andC. Antistius Vetus, the year from the foundation of the %0aCity, 775. It is a matter for surprise, how almost futile, Ave %0amay say, was the cause which led to this change. C. Sulpicius %0aGalba, 9 desirous in his youth to establish his credit with the %0aEmperor by hunting 10 out grounds for prosecuting 11 the keepers %0a%0as "Turmffl." Squadrons of thirty " equites" or horsemen; ten of %0awhich squadrons were attached to each legion. %0a%0a4 Before the time of Augustus, there were but three decuries. %0a%0a8 A law introduced by Aurelius Cotta, b.c. 70, enacted that the Ju- %0adicrs should be chosen from the three classes — of Senators, Equites, and %0aTribuni aerarii, or Tribunes of the treasury, these last being taken from %0athe body of the people, and being persons possessed of some property. %0a%0a6 Members selected by lot. 7 " Nongenti." %0a%0a8 Tacitus says that this took place the year before, iu the consulship of %0aC.

[Book XXXIII. %0a%0a%0a%0aof victualling-houses, made complaint in the senate that the %0aproprietors of those places were in the habit of protecting %0athemselves from the consequences of their guilt by their plea %0aof wearing the golden ring. 12 For this reason, an ordinance %0awas made that no person whatsoever should have this right of %0awearing the ring, unless, freeborn himself as regarded his %0afather and paternal grandfather, he should be assessed by the %0acensors at four hundred thousand sesterces, and entitled, under %0athe Julian Law, 13 to sit in the fourteen tiers of seats at the %0atheatre. In later times, however, people began to apply in %0awhole crowds for this mark of rank ; aud in consequence of %0athe diversities of opinion which were occasioned thereby, the %0aEmperor Caius 14 added a fifth decury to the number. Indeed %0ato such a pitch has conceit now arisen, that whereas, under the %0alate Emperor Augustus, the decuries could not be completed, %0aat the present day they will not suffice to receive all the mem- %0abers of the equestrian order, and we see in every quarter per- %0asons even who have been but just liberated from slavery, making %0aa leap all at once to the distinction of the golden ring : a thing %0athat never used to happen in former days, as it was by the %0aling of iron that the equites and the judices were then to be %0arecognized. %0a%0aIndeed, so promiscuously was this privilege at last conferred, %0athat Flavius Proculus, one of the equites, informed against %0afour hundred persons on this ground, before the Emperor Clau- %0adius, who was then censor : 15 and thus we see, an order, which %0awas established as a mark of distinction from other private in- %0adividuals of free birth, has been shared in common with slaves ! %0a%0aThe Gracchi were the first to attach to this order the separate %0aappellation of "judices," their object being at the same moment %0aa seditious popularity and the humiliation of the senate. After %0athe fall of these men, in consequence of the varying results of %0aseditious movements, the name and influence of the equestrian %0aorder were lost, and became merged in those of the publicani,i« %0a%0a12 Or, in other words, belonging to the equestrian order. The Roman %0aequites often followed the pursuits of bankers, and farmers of the public %0arevenues. %0a%0a13 A law passed in the time of Julius Caesar, b c. 69, which permitted %0aEoman equites, in case they or their parents had ever had a Census %0aequestris, to sit in the fourteen rows fixed by the Lex Roscia Theatralis. %0a%0a14 Caligula. 15 Conjointly with L.

At last, however, Marcus Cicero, during %0ahis consulship, and at the period of the Catilinarian troubles, %0are-established the equestrian name, it being his vaunt that he %0ahimself had sprung from that order, and he, by certain acts of %0apopularity peculiar to himself, having conciliated its support. %0aSince that period, it is very clear that the equites have formed %0athe third body in the state, and the name of the equestrian order %0ahas been added to the formula — "The Senate and People of %0aRome." Henqe 17 it is, too, that at the present day even, the %0aname of this order is written after that of the people, it being %0athe one that was the last instituted. %0a%0aCHAP. 9. — HOW OFTEN THE NAME OE THE EQTJESTEIAN OBDEE %0aHAS BEEN CHANGED. %0a%0aIndeed, the name itself of the equites even, has been fre- %0aquently changed, and that too, in the case of those who only %0aowed their name to the fact of their service on horseback. %0aUnder Romulus and the other kings, the equites were known %0aas " Celeres," 18 then again as " Flexuntes," 19 and after that %0aas " Trossuli," 20 from the fact of their having taken a certain %0atown of Etruria, situate nine miles on this side of Yolsinii, %0awithout any assistance from the infantry ; a name too which %0asurvived till after the death of C. Gracchus. %0a%0aIn reality, they were mostly members of the equestrian order, and the %0awords "equites" and " publicani" are often used as synonymous. %0a%0a17 " This passage seems to be the addition of some ignorant copyist. It %0ais indeed a remarkable fact, that we have no inscription in which we see %0athe Equites named after the people as well as the Senate." — Laboulaye, %0aEssai sur Us his Criminelles des Eomains ; Paris, 1845, p. 224. %0a%0a18 According to Livy, B. i. c. 15, the Celeres were three hundred Roman %0aknights whom Romulus established as a body-guard. Their name, pro- %0abably, was derived from the Greek KfA»jc, a "war-horse," or "charger," %0aand the body consisted, no doubt, of the patricians in general, or such of %0athem as could keep horses. Another origin assigned to the appellation is %0a11 Celer," the name of a chieftain, who was a favourite of Romulus. The %0aadjective "celer," ** swift," owes its origin, probably, to the title of these %0ahorsemen. %0a%0a19 A title derived, possibly, as Delafosse suggests, " a flectendis habenis," %0afrom " managing the reins." %0a%0a20 Called " Trossum " or " Trossulum," it is supposed. The remains %0aof a town are still to be seen at Trosso, two miles from Montefiascone in %0aTuscany.

Our ancestors, %0afor instance, presented tores 24 of gold to the auxiliaries and %0aforeign troops, while to Roman citizens they only granted %0asilver 25 ones : bracelets 26 too, were given by them to citizens, %0abut never to foreigners. %0a%0aCHAP. 11. — AT WHAT PERIOD THE FIRST CROWN OF GOLD WAS %0aPRESENTED. %0a%0aBut, a thing that is more surprising still, crowns 27 of gold %0awere given to the citizens as well. As to the person who was %0afirst presented with one, so far as I have enquired, I have not %0abeen able to ascertain his name : L. Piso says, however, that %0athe Dictator 28 A. Posthumius was the first who conferred one : %0aon taking the camp of the Latins at Lake Pegillus, 29 he gave %0aa crown of gold, made from the spoil, to the soldier whose %0avalour had mainly contributed to this success.

But in warfare, %0athis species of luxury made such rapid advances, that in the %0aEpistles of M. Brutus from the Plains of Philippi, we find ex- %0apressions of indignation at the fibulse 33 of gold that were worn %0aby the tribunes. Yes, so it is, by Hercules ! and yet you, the %0asame Brutus, have not said a word about women wearing gold %0aupon their feet ; while we, on the other hand, charge him with %0acriminality 34 who was the first to confer dignity upon gold by %0awearing the ring. Let men even, at the present day, wear gold %0aupon the arms in form of bracelets — known as " dardania," %0abecause the practice first originated in Dardania, and called %0a"viriolse" in the language of the Celts, " viria?" 33 in that of %0aCeltiberia, let women wear gold upon their arms 36 and %0aall their fingers, their necks, their ears, the tresses of their %0ahair ; let chains of gold run meandering along their sides ; %0aand in the still hours of the night let sachets filled with pearls %0ahang suspended from the necks of their mistresses, all bedizened %0awith gold, so that in their very sleep even they may still %0aretain the consciousness that they are the possessors of such %0a%0a30 a.u.c. 479, and b.c. 275.

The " as" of cop- %0aper weighed exactly one libra ; and hence it is that we still use %0athe terms "libella" 47 and " dupondius." 48 Hence it is, too, that %0afines and penalties are inflicted under the name of "ass grave," 49 %0aand that the words still used in keeping accounts are " ex- %0apensa," 50 " impendia," 51 and " dependere." 62 Hence, too, the %0aword " stipendium," meaning the pay of the soldiers, which is %0anothing more than " stipis pondera ;" 53 and from the same source %0athose other words, " dispensatores" 54 and " libripendes." 55 It is %0aalso from this circumstance that in sales of slaves, at the present %0aday even, the formality of using the balance is introduced. %0a%0aKing Servius was the first to make an impress upon copper. %0aBefore his time, according to Timseus, at Rome the raw metal %0aonly was used. The form of a sheep was the first figure im- %0apressed upon money, and to this fact it owes its name, %0a" pecunia." 66 The highest figure at which one man's property %0awas assessed in the reign of that king was one hundred and %0a%0a44 The first crime having been committed by him who introduced the %0ause of gold rings. See the beginning of c. 4 of this Book. %0a%0a45 The golden denarius was known also as the " aureus" or " gold %0acoin." It was worth 25 silver denarii. As to the modern value of the %0amoney used by the ancients, see the Introduction to Vol. III. The golden %0adenarius is mentioned also in B. xxxiv. c. 17, and in B. xxxvii. c. 3. %0a%0a46 a.u.c. 479. %0a%0a41 Meaning, literally, the "little pound," in reference to the diminished %0aweight of the " as." %0a%0a4B Meaning "two pounds," or in other words, "two asses."

[Book XXXIII. %0a%0a%0a%0atwenty thousand asses, and consequently that amount of pro- %0aperty was considered the standard of the first class. %0a%0aSilver was not impressed with a mark until the year of the %0aCity 485, the year of the consulship of Q,. Ogulnius and C. %0aFabius, five years before the First Punic "War ; at which time %0ait was ordained that the value of the denarius should be ten %0alibrae" of copper, that of the quinarius five librae, and that %0aof the sestertius two librae and a half. The weight, how- %0aever, of the libra of copper was diminished during the First %0aPunic War, the republic not having means to meet its ex- %0apenditure : in consequence of which, an ordinance was made %0athat the as should in future be struck of two ounces weight. %0aBy this contrivance a saving of five-sixths was effected, and %0athe public debt was liquidated. The impression upon these %0acopper coins was a two-faced Janus on one side, and the beak %0aof a ship of war on the other : the triens, 5S however, and the %0aquadrans, 59 bore the impression of a ship. The quadrans, too, %0ahad, previously to this, been called " teruncius," as being three %0aunciae 80 in weight. At a later period again, when Hannibal %0awas pressing hard upon Rome, in the dictatorship of Q. Fabius %0aMaximus, asses of one ounce weight were struck, and it was %0aordained that the value of the denarius should be sixteen asses, %0athat of the quinarius eight asses, and that of the sestertius %0afour asses ; by which last reduction of the weight of the as %0athe republic made a clear gain cf one half. Still, however, %0a60 far as the pay of the soldiers is concerned, one denarius has %0aalways been given for every ten asses. The impressions upon %0athe coins of silver were two-horse and four-horse chariots, %0aand hence it is that they received the names of " bigati " and %0a" quadrigati." %0a%0aShortly after, in accordance with the Law of Papirius, asses %0awere coined weighing half an ounce only. Livius Drusus, %0awhen 61 tribune of the people, alloyed the silver with one-eighth %0apart of copper. The coin that is known at the present day %0aas the "victoriatus," 62 was first struck in accordance with the %0a%0a67 " Pounds " or " asses." The third of an " as " %0a%0a59 The fourth of an " as." %0a%0a60 Or ounces ; being one-fourth of the " as," of one "libra" in weight. %0aSee Introduction to Vol. III. si x.v.c. 663. %0a%0a62 The same as the quinarius, one-half of the denarius.

The impression upon it is a figure of Victory, %0aand hence its name. %0a%0aThe first golden coin was struck sixty-two years after that %0aof silver, the scruple of gold being valued at twenty sesterces ; a %0acomputation which gave, according to the value of the sesterce %0athen in use, nine hundred sesterces to each libra of gold. 63 %0aIn later times, again, an ordinance was made, that denarii of %0agold should be struck, at the rate of forty denarii 64 to each %0alibra of gold ; after which period, the emperors gradually %0acurtailed the weight of the golden denarius, until at last, in %0athe reign of Nero, it was coined at the rate of forty-five to %0athe libra. %0a%0aCHAP. 14. CONSIDEKATIONS ON MAN'S CUPIDITY FOR GOLD. %0a%0aBut the invention of money opened a new field to human %0aavarice, by giving rise to usury and the practice of lending %0amoney at interest, while the owner passes a life of idleness : %0aand it was with no slow advances that, not mere avarice only, %0abut a perfect hunger 65 for gold became inflamed with a sort of %0arage for acquiring : to such a degree, in fact, that Septimuleius, %0athe familiar friend of Caius Gracchus, not only cut off his %0ahead, upon which a price had been set of its weight in gold, %0a%0a63 As, originally, there were 288 "scripula," or scruples, to the "libra" or %0apound, this would appear to give 5760 sestertii to the pound of gold, and %0anot 900 merely. Though this apparent discrepancy has generally puzzled %0athe commentators, the solution, as suggested by M. Parisot, in the Notes %0ato Ajasson's Translation, appears equally simple and satisfactory. He %0asuggests that in the "as," or "libra," of two ounces, there were 288 %0ascruples. Now, the scruple remaining the same, when the as or libra was %0areduced to one ounce, it would contain but 144 of these scruples. Then, %0aon milking the as the sixteenth part of a denarius instead of the tenth, it %0awould lose three-eighths of its value in scruples, or in other words, 54 %0ascruples, thus making it worth but 90 scruples. Then again, as above %0astated, by the Papirian Law, the weight or value of the libra or as was %0areduced one-half, making its value in scruples only 45 ; or, in other words, %0afive thirty-seconds of its original value, when worth two unciae or ounces. %0aThis number of scruples to the libra would give, at the rate of twenty %0a6esterces to the scruple of gold, exactly 900 sesterces to the libra of gold. %0a%0a64 Or "aurei." %0a%0a63 " Fames auri."

Nor %0awas it now any individual citizen, but the universal Roman %0aname, that had been rendered infamous by avarice, when King %0aMithridates caused molten gold to be poured into the mouth %0aof Aquilius 65 the Eoman general, whom he had taken prisoner : %0asuch were the results of cupidity. %0a%0aOne cannot but feel ashamed, on looking at those new-fangled %0anames which are invented every now and then, from the %0aGreek language, by which to designate vessels of silver Ala- %0agreed 69 or inlaid with gold, and the various other practices by %0awhich such articles of luxury, when only gilded/ 0 are made to %0asell at a higher price than they would have done if made of %0asolid gold : and this, too, when we know that Spartacus 11 forbade %0aany one of his followers to introduce either gold or silver into %0athe camp — so much more nobleness of mind was there in those %0adays, even in our runaway slaves. %0a%0aThe orator Messalahas informed us that Antonius the triumvir %0amade use of golden vessels when satisfying the most humiliat- %0aing wants of nature, a piece of criminality that would have %0areflected disgrace upon Cleopatra even ! Till then, the most %0aconsummate instances of a similar licentiousness had been found %0aamong strangers only — that of King Philip, namely, who was in %0athe habit of sleeping with a golden goblet placed beneath his pil- %0alows, and that of Hagnon of Teos, a commander under Alex- %0aander the Great, who used to fasten the soles of his sandals %0awith nails of gold. 72 It was reserved for Antonius to be the %0aonly one thus to impart a certain utility to gold, by putting an %0a%0a86 Another version of this story was, that he extracted the brain, and %0ainserted lead in its place. «' See B. xiv. c. 16. %0a%0a68 In B.C. 88, M.

TnE PEKSONS WHO HAVE POSSESSED THE GREATEST %0a%0aQUANTITY OF GOLD AND SILVER. %0a%0aFor my own part, I am much surprised that the Roman peo- %0aple has always imposed upon conquered nations a tribute in %0asilver, and not in gold ; Carthage, for instance, from which, %0aupon its conquest under Hannibal, a ransom was exacted in %0athe shape of a yearly 74 payment, for fifty years, of eight hun- %0adred thousand pounds' weight of silver, but no gold. And yet %0ait does not appear that this could have arisen from there being %0aso little gold then in use throughout the world. Midas and %0aCroesus, before this, had possessed gold to an endless amount : %0aCyrus, already, on his conquest of Asia, 75 had found a booty %0aconsisting of twenty-four thousand pounds' weight of gold, %0ain addition to vessels and other articles of wrought gold, as %0awell as leaves 76 of trees, a plane-tree, and a vine, all made of %0athat metal. %0a%0aIt was through this conquest too, that he carried off fire %0ahundred thousand 77 talents of silver, as well as the vase of %0aSemiramis, 78 the weight of which alone amounted to fifteen %0atalents, the Egyptian talent being equal, according to Varro, %0ato eighty of our pounds. Before this time too, Saulaces, the %0adescendant of iEetes, had reigned in Colchis, 79 who, on finding %0a%0a73 A slave only ; and not by any of his brother patricians. Antony was %0arendered infamous by his proscriptions. %0a%0a74 Appian and Livy mention the fine as consisting of ten thousand %0atalents in all, or in other words, eight hundred thousand pounds of silver %0a(at eighty pounds to the talent). Sillig is therefore of opinion that Pliny %0ais in error here in inserting the word " annua." The payment of the tea %0athousand talents, we learn from the same authorities, was spread over fifty %0ayears. 75 Asia Minor, %0a%0a76 "Folia."

[Book XX5II1 %0a%0a%0a%0aa tract of virgin earth, in the country of the Suani, 80 extracted %0afrom it a large amount of gold and silver, it is said, and whose %0akingdom besides, had been famed for the possession of the %0aGolden Fleece. The golden arches, too, of his palace, we find %0aspoken of, the silver supports and columns, and pilasters, all %0aof which he had come into possession of on the conquest of %0aSesostris, 81 king of Egypt ; a monarch so haughty, that every %0ayear, it is said, it was his practice to select one of his vassal %0akings by lot, and yoking him to his car, celebrate his triumph %0aafresh. %0a%0aCHAP. 16. AT WHAT PERIOD SILVER FIRST MADE ITS APPEAK- %0a%0aANCE UPON THE ARENA AND UPON THE STAGE. %0a%0a"We, too, have done things that posterity may probably look %0aupon as fabulous. Caesar, who was afterwards dictator, but %0aat that time aedile, was the first person, on the occasion of the %0afuneral games in honour of his father, to employ all the ap- %0aparatus of the arena 82 in silver ; and it was on the same occa- %0asion that for the first time criminals encountered wild beasts %0awith implements of silver, a practice imitated at the present %0aday in our municipal towns even. %0a%0aAt the games celebrated by C. Antonius the stage was made %0aof 83 silver; and the same was the case at those celebrated %0aby L. Huraena. The Emperor Caius had a scaffold 84 intro- %0aduced into the Circus, upon which there were one hundred and %0atwenty-four thousand pounds' weight of silver. His successor %0aClaudius, on the occasion of his triumph over Britain, an- %0anounced by the inscriptions that among the coronets of gold, %0athere was one weighing seven thousand 84 pounds' weight, contri- %0abuted by Nearer Spain, and another of nine thousand pounds, %0a%0a80 See B. vi. c. 4. %0a%0a31 This story of the defeat of the great Ramses-Sesostris hy a petty king %0aof Colchis, would almost appear apocryphal.

It is just possible, however, that %0athe latter may have been the united weights of all the coronets contributed %0aby Spain and Gaul respectively, the word " inter " being an interpolation. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 18.] AT WHAT PERIOD CEILINGS WEItE FLU8T GILDED. 95 %0a%0a%0a%0apresented by Gallia Comata. 86 Nero, who succeeded him, covered %0athe Theatre of Porapeius with gold for one day, 61 the occasion on %0awhich he displayed it to Tiridates, king of Armenia.

Nay, even more than this, the oftener gold is sub- %0ajected to the action of fire, the more refined in quality it be- %0acomes ; indeed, fire is one test of its goodness, as, when sub- %0a%0a93 a.u.c. 612. * See B. xix. c. 6. %0a%0a95 Chapter 57. 96 In fact, no colour at all. %0a%0a97 In this climate, the light of most of the stars has the complexion, not %0aof gold, but of silver. 9 s The topaz, for instance. %0a%0a99 For ductility and malleability, both which terms may perhaps be in- %0acluded in the "facilitas" of Pliny, gold is unrivalled among the metals, hi %0ato weight, it is heavier than lead, the specific gravity of gold being 19.258, %0aand that of lead 11 352. Pliny is therefore wrong in both of these assertions. %0a%0a1 He forgets asbestus here, a substance which he has mentioned in %0aB. xix. c. 4. %0a%0a2 Chlorine, however, and nitro-muriatic acid corrode and dissolve gold, %0aforming a chloride of gold, which is soluble in water. Ajasson remarks, %0athat gold becomes volatilized by the heat of a burning- glass of three or %0afour feet in diameter ; and that when it acts as the conductor of a strong %0acurrent of electricity, it becomes reduced to dust instantaneously, presenting %0aa bright greenish light, %0a%0a%0a%0aChap, in.] eeasoxs why gold is so highly valued. OJ" %0a%0a%0a%0amitted to intense heat, gold ought to assume a similar colour, %0aand turn red and igneous in appearance ; a mode of testing %0awhich is known as " obrussa." 3 %0a%0aThe first great proof, however, of the goodness of gold, is %0aits melting with the greatest difficulty : in addition to which, %0ait is a fact truly marvellous, that though proof against the most %0aintense fire, if made with wood charcoal, it will melt with the %0agreatest readiness upon a fire made with chaff ; 4 and that, for %0athe purpose of purifying it, it is fused with lead. 5 There is %0aanother reason too, which still more tends to enhance its value, %0athe fact that it wears the least of all metals by continual use : %0awhereas with silver, copper, and lead, lines may be traced, 6 and %0athe hands become soiled with the substance that comes from off %0athem. Nor is there any material more malleable than this, %0anone that admits of a more extended division, seeing that a %0asingle ounce of it admits of being beaten out into seven hun- %0adred and fifty 7 leaves, or more, four fingers in length by the %0asame in breadth. The thickest kind of gold-leaf is known as %0a"leaf of Praeneste," it still retaining that name from the %0aexcellence of the gilding upon the statue of Fortune 8 there. %0aThe next in thickness is known as the " quaestorian leaf." In %0aSpain, small pieces of gold are known by the name of " striges." 9 %0a%0aA thing that is not the case with any other metal, gold is %0afound pure in masses 10 or in the form of dust; 11 and whereas %0a%0a3 The gold thus tested was called " obrussum," " obryzum," or " obri- %0azum," from the Greek oj3pv£ov, meaning "pure gold." %0a%0a4 See B. xviii. c. 23, where he calls the chaff used for this purpose by the %0aname of " acus." %0a%0a8 The present mode of assaying the precious metals, is by fusing them %0aupon a cupel with lead. %0a%0a6 For which purpose, lead was used, no doubt, in drawing the lines in the %0aMSS. of the ancients. See Beckmann's Hist. Inv. Vol. II. p. 389. Bohn'sEd. %0a%0a7 This is far surpassed at the present day, its malleability being such, %0athat it may be beaten into leaves not more than one two hundred and %0aeighty thousandth of an inch in thickness, and its ductility admitting of %0aone grain being drawn out into five hundred feet of wire.

In addition to this, gold steadily resists %0athe corrosive action of salt and vinegar, 13 things which obtain %0athe mastery over all other substances : it admits, too, beyond %0aall other metals, of being spun out and woven 14 like wool. 15 Ver- %0arius tells us that Tarquinius Priscus celebrated a triumph, clad %0ain a tunic of gold ; and I myself have seen Agrippina, the wife %0aof the Emperor Claudius, on the occasion of a naval combat %0awhich he exhibited, seated by him, attired in a military scarf 10 %0amade entirely of woven gold without any other material.

To effect this %0amode of gilding, the copper is first well hammered, after which %0ait is subjected to the action of fire, and then cooled with a %0amixture of salt, vinegar, and alum. 22 It is then cleansed of all %0aextraneous substances, it being known by its brightness when %0ait has been sufficiently purified. This done, it is again %0aheated by fire, in order to enable it, when thus prepared, with %0athe aid of an amalgam of pumice, alum, and quicksilver, to %0areceive the gold leaf when applied. Alum has the same pro- %0aperty of purifying copper, that we have already 23 mentioned %0aas belonging to lead with reference to gold. %0a%0aCHAP. 21. (4.) — HOW GOID IS FOUND. %0a%0aGold is found in our own part of the world ; not to mention %0athe gold extracted from the earth in India by the ants, 24 and %0ain Scythia by the Griffins. 25 Among us it is procured in %0athree different ways ; the first of which is, in the shape of %0adust, found in running streams, the Tagus 26 in Spain, for instance, %0athe Padus in Italy, the Hebrus in Thracia, the Pactolus in %0aAsia, and the Ganges in India ; indeed, there is no gold found %0ain a more perfect state than this, thoroughly polished as it is %0aby the continual attrition of the current. %0a%0aA second mode of obtaining gold is by sinking shafts or seek- %0aing it among the debris of mountains ; both of which methods %0ait will be as well to describe. The persons in search of gold %0ain the first place remove the " segutilum," 27 such being the %0a%0aployed for this cement, called ' leucophoron,' one may readily conceive %0athat, it must have been a ferruginous ochre, or kind of bole, which is still %0aused as a ground.

This done, a bed is made, the sand of which is washed, %0aand, according to the residue found after washing, a conjecture %0ais formed as to the richness of the vein. Sometimes, indeed, %0agold is found at once in the surface earth, a success, however, %0ahut rarely experienced. .Recently, for instance, in the reign of %0aNero, a vein was discovered in Dalmatia, which yielded daily %0aas much as fifty pounds' weight of gold. The gold that is %0athus found in the surface crust is known as " talutium," 28 ^ %0acases where there is auriferous earth beneath. The mountains %0aof Spain, 29 in other respects arid and sterile, and productive of %0anothing whatever, are thus constrained by man to be fertile, %0ain supplying him with this precious commodity. %0a%0aThe gold that is extracted from shafts is known by some %0apersons as " canalicium," and by others as " canaliense ;" 30 it %0ais found adhering to the gritty crust of marble, 31 and, altogether %0adifferent from the form in which it sparkles in the sapphirus 32 %0aof the East, and in the stone of Thebais 33 and other gems, it %0ais seen interlaced with the molecules of the marble. The %0achannels of these veins are found running in various directions %0aalong the sides of the shafts, and hence the name of the gold %0athey yield — "canalicium." 34 In these shafts, too, the su- %0aperincumbent earth is kept from falling in by means of wooden %0apillars. The substance that is extracted is first broken up, %0aand then washed ; after which it is subjected to the action of %0afire, and ground to a fine powder. This powder is known as %0a" apitascudes," while the silver which becomes disengaged in %0athe 35 furnace has the name of " sudor" 36 given to it.

This ''sweat" or ''silver" would in reality be a %0ageneral name for all the minerals that were volatilized by the heat of the %0afurnace ; while under the name of "scoria" would be comprised pyrites, %0aquartz, petrosilex, and other similar substances. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 21.] %0a%0a%0a%0aHOW GOLD IS FOUND. %0a%0a%0a%0a101 %0a%0a%0a%0apurities that escape by the chimney, as in the case of all %0aother metals, are known by the name of " scoria." In the %0acase of gold, this scoria is broken up a second time, and melted %0aover again. The crucibles used for this purpose are made of %0a" tasconium," 37 a white earth similar to potter's clay in ap- %0apearance ; there being no other substance capable of with- %0astanding the strong current of air, the action of the fixe, and %0athe intense heat of the melted metal. %0a%0aThe third method of obtaining gold surpasses the labours %0aof the Giants 38 even : by the aid of galleries driven to a long %0adistance, mountains are excavated by the light of torches, the %0aduration of which forms the set times for work, the workmen %0anever seeing the light of day for many months together. %0aThese mines are known as " arrugiae ;" 89 and not unfrequently %0aclefts are formed on a sudden, the earth sinks in, and the work- %0amen are crushed beneath ; so that it would really appear less rash %0ato go in search of pearls and purples at the bottom of the sea, %0aso much more dangerous to ourselves have we made the earth %0athan the water ! Hence it is, that in this kind of mining, %0aarches are left at frequent intervals for the purpose of sup- %0aporting the weight of the mountain above. In mining either %0aby shaft or by gallery, barriers of silex are met with, which %0ahave to be driven asunder by the aid of fire and vinegar ; 40 or %0amore frequently, as this method fills the gallerieswith suffocating %0avapours and smoke, to be broken to pieces with bruising- %0amachines shod with pieces of iron weighing one hundred and %0afifty pounds : which done, the fragments are carried out on the %0aworkmen's shoulders, night and day, each man passing them %0aon to his neighbour in the dark, it being only those at the pit's %0amouth that ever see the light. In cases where the bed of silex %0aappears too thick to admit of being penetrated, the miner traces %0aalongthe sides of it, and so turns it. Andyet, after all, the labour %0aentailed by this silex is looked upon as comparatively easy, there %0abeing an earth — a kind of potter's clay mixed with gravel, %0a" gangadia" by name, which it is almost impossible to overcome. %0aThis earth has to be attacked with iron wedges and hammers %0a%0a87 The cupel or crucible is still known in Spain by the name of tasco. %0a%0a38 Who were said to have heaped one mountain on another in their war %0awith the gods. %0a%0a39 Deep mines in Spain are still called arrugia, a term also used to %0asignify gold beneath the surface.

[Book XXXIII. %0a%0a%0a%0alike those previously mentioned, 41 and it is generally considered %0athat there is nothing more stubborn in existence — except in- %0adeed the greed for gold, which is the most stubborn of all things?. %0a%0aWhen these operations are all completed, beginning at the %0alast, they cut away 42 the wooden pillars at the point where %0athey support the roof: the coming downfall gives warning, %0awhich is instantly perceived by the sentinel, and by him only, %0awho is set to watch upon a peak of the same mountain. By %0avoice as well as by signals, he orders the workmen to be im- %0amediately summoned from their labours, and at the same %0amoment takes to flight himself. The mountain, rent to pieces, %0ais cleft asunder, hurling its debris to a distance with a crash %0awhich it is impossible for the human imagination to conceive ; %0aand from the midst of a cloud of dust, of a density quite in- %0acredible, the victorious miners gaze upon this downfall of %0aNature. Nor yet even then are they sure of gold, nor indeed %0awere they by any means certain that there was any to he %0afound when they first began to excavate, it being quite suf- %0aficient, as an inducement to undergo such perils and to incur %0asuch vast expense, to entertain the hope that they shall obtain %0awhat they so eagerly desire. %0a%0aAnother labour, too, quite equal to this, and one which en- %0atails even greater expense, is that of bringing rivers 43 from %0athe more elevated mountain heights, a distance in many in- %0astances of one hundred miles perhaps, for the purpose of %0awashing these debris. The channels thus formed are called %0a"corrugi," from our word " corrivatio," 44 1 suppose ; and even %0awhen these are once made, they entail a thousand fresh labours. %0aThe fall, for instance, must be steep, that the water may he %0aprecipitated, so to say, rather than flow ; and it is in this %0amanner that it is brought from the most elevated points. %0aThen, too, vallies and crevasses have to be united by the aid of %0aaqueducts, and in another place impassable rocks have to be %0ahewn away, and forced to make room for hollowed troughs of %0awood ; the person hewing them hanging suspended all the %0atime with ropes, so that to a spectator who views the operations %0a%0a41 The breaking-machines, used for crushing the silex. %0a%0a42 " Csedunt" is certainly a preferable reading to " cadunt," though the %0alatter is given by the Bamberg MS. %0a%0a43 A similar method of washing auriferous earth or sand in the mines, %0ais still employed in some cases. %0a%0a44 "The bringing of water into one channel," %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 21.] %0a%0a%0a%0aHOW GOLD IS FOUNT). %0a%0a%0a%0a103 %0a%0a%0a%0afrom a distance, the workmen have all the appearance, not so %0amuch of wild beasts, as of birds upon the wing. 45 Hanging %0athus suspended in most instances, they take the levels, and %0atrace with lines the course the water is to take ; and thus, %0awhere there is no room even for man to plant a footstep, are %0arivers traced out by the hand of man. The water, too, is con- %0asidered in an unfit state for washing, if the current of the %0ariver carries any mud along with it. The kind of earth tbat %0ayields this mud is known as " urium;" 46 and hence it is that %0ain tracing out these channels, they carry the water over beds %0aof silex or pebbles, and carefully avoid this urium. When %0athey have reached the head of the fall, at the very brow of the %0amountain, reservoirs are hollowed out, a couple of hundred %0afeet in length and breadth, and some ten feet in depth. In %0athese reservoirs there are generally five sluices left, about %0athree feet square ; so that, the moment the reservoir is filled, the %0afloodgates are struck away, and the torrent bursts forth with %0asuch a degree of violence as to roll onwards any fragments of %0arock which may obstruct its passage. %0a%0a"When they have reached the level ground, too, there is %0astill another labour that awaits them. Trenches — known as %0a" agogae" 47 — have to be dug for the passage of the water; and %0athese, at regular intervals, have a layer of ulex placed at the %0abottom. This ulex 48 is a plant like rosemary in appearance, %0arough and prickly, and well-adapted for arresting any pieces %0aof gold that may be carried along. The sides, too, are closed %0ain with planks, and are supported by arches when carried over %0asteep and precipitous spots. The earth, carried onwards in %0athe stream, arrives at the sea at last, and thus is the shattered %0amountain washed away ; causes which have greatly tended to %0aextend the shores of Spain by these encroachments upon the %0adeep. It is also by the agency of canals of this description %0athat the material, excavated at the cost of such immense la- %0abour by the process previously described, 49 is washed and car- %0a%0a45 Or as Holland quaintly renders it, " Some flying spirit or winged %0adevill of the air." %0a44 Magnesian carbonate of lime, or dolomite, Ajasson thinks.- %0a47 From the Greek, aywy?}. %0a%0a49 It does not appear to have been identified ; and it can hardly be %0athe same as the Ulex Europseus of modern Natural History, our Furze %0acr Gorse. %0a%0a49 That of sinking shafts, described already in this Chapter. %0a%0a%0a%0a104 %0a%0a%0a%0aflint's natuuax uistobt. %0a%0a%0a%0a[Book XXXIII. %0a%0a%0a%0aricd away ; for otherwise the shafts would soon be choked up %0aby it. %0a%0aThe gold found by excavating with galleries does not require %0ato be melted, but is pure gold at once. In these excavations, %0atoo, it is found in lumps, as also in the shafts which are sunk, %0asometimes exceeding ten pounds even. The names given to %0athese lumps are " palagse," and " palacurnse," 60 while the gold %0afound in small grains is known as " baluce." The ulex that %0ais used for the above purpose is dried and burnt, after which %0athe ashes of it are washed upon a bed of grassy turf, in order %0athat the gold may be deposited thereupon. %0a%0aAsturia, Gallaocia, and Lusitania furnish in this manner, %0ayearly, according to some authorities, twenty thousand pounds' %0aweight of gold, the produce of Asturia forming the major part. %0aIndeed, there is no part of the world that for centuries has %0amaintained such a continuous fertility in gold. I have already' 1 %0amentioned that by an ancient decree of the senate, the soil of %0aItaly has been protected from these researches ; otherwise, %0athere would be no land more fertile in metals. There is ex- > %0atant also a censorial law relative to the gold mines of Victumulae, %0ain the territory of Vercellse, 52 by which the farmers of the %0arevenue were forbidden to employ more than five thousand %0amen at the works. %0a%0aCHAP. 22.

It is just the colour of %0agold, but brittle, like mirror-stone, 54 in fact. This substance %0agreatly excited the hopes of the Emperor Caius, 56 a prince who %0awas most greedy for gold. He accordingly had a large quantity %0aof it melted, and really did obtain some excellent gold ; i6 but %0athen the proportion was so extremely small, that he found him- %0aself a loser thereby.

In one %0amine, and that only, the one known as the mine of Albucrara, %0ain Gallaecia, 68 the proportion of silver is but one thirty-sixth : %0ahence it is that the ore of this mine is so much mere valuable %0athan that of others. Whenever the proportion of silver is one- %0afifth, the ore is known also by the name of " electrum;" 59 grains, %0atoo, of this metal are often found in the gold known as "canali- %0aense." 60 An artificial 61 electrum, too, is made, by mixing %0asilver with gold. If the proportion of silver exceeds one-fifth, %0athe metal offers no resistance on the anvil. %0a%0aElectrum, too, was highly esteemed in ancient times, as we %0alearn from the testimony of Homer, who represents 62 the palace %0aof Menelaiis as refulgent with gold and electrum, silver and %0aivory. At Lindos, in the island of Rhodes, there is a temple %0adedicated to Minerva, in which there is a goblet of electrum, %0aconsecrated by Helena : history states also that it was moulded %0aafter the proportions of her bosom. One peculiar advantage %0aof electrum is, its superior brilliancy to silver by lamp-light. %0aXative electrum has also the property of detecting poisons ; %0afor in such case, semicircles, resembling the rainbow in appear- %0aance, will form upon the surface of the goblet, and emit a %0acrackling noise, like that of flame, thus givng a twofold indica- %0ation of the presence of poison. 63 %0a%0aCHAP. 24.

To what par- %0aticular region this name belongs, we have already cs stated, it %0abeing that of a divinity 66 held in the highest veneration by %0athe nations in that part of the world. This statue was carried %0aoff during the wars of Antonius with the people of Parthia ; %0aand a witty saying is told, with reference to it, of one of the %0aveterans of the ltoman army, a native of Bononia. Enter- %0ataining on one occasion the late Emperor Augustus at dinner, %0ahe was asked by that prince whether he was aware that the %0aperson who was the first to commit this violence upon the %0astatue, had been struck with blindness and paralysis, and then %0aexpired. To this he made answer, that at that very moment %0aAugustus was making his dinner off of one of her legs, for that %0ahe himself was the very man, and to that bit of plunder he %0ahad been indebted for all his fortune. 67 %0a%0aAs regards statues of human beings, Gorgias of Leontini 68 %0awas the first to erect a solid statue of gold, in the Temple at %0aDelphi, in honour of himself, about the seventieth 69 Olympiad : %0aso great were the fortunes then made by teaching the art of %0aoratory ! %0a%0aCHAP. 25. EIGHT REMEDIES DEEIVED FROM GOLD. %0a%0aGold is efficacious as a remedy in many ways, being applied %0ato wounded persons and to infants, to render any malpractices %0aof sorcery comparatively innocuous that may be directed against %0athem. Gold, however, itself is mischievous in its effects if %0a%0a65 In B. v. c. 20, most probably.

The Greek writers sometimes identify this goddess with their %0aArtemis and their Aphrodite. %0a%0a67 Holland has strangely mistaken the meaning of the veteran's reply; %0a" Yea, sir, that it is ; and that methinks you should know best, for even %0anow a leg of his you have at supper, and all your wealth besides is come %0aunto you by that saccage." He then adds, by way of Note, " For Au- %0agustus Cassar defeited Antonie, and was mightily enriched by the spoile %0aof him." %0a%0a« 9 In Sicily. According to Valerius Maximus and other writers, a statue %0aof solid gold was erected by the whole of Greece, in the temple at Delphi, %0ain honour of Gorgias, who was distinguished for his eloquence and literary %0aattainments. The leading opinion of Gorgias was, that nothing had any %0areal existence. %0a%0a69 The ninetieth Olympiad, about the year 420 b.c, is much more pro- %0abably the correct reading ; as it was about the seventieth Olympiad, or some- %0awhat later, that Gorgias was born. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 26.] CEKTSOCOLLA. 107 %0a%0acarried over the head, in the case of chickens and lamhs more %0aparticularly. The proper remedy in such case is to wash the %0agold, and to sprinkle the water upon the objects which it is %0awished to preserve. Gold, too, is melted with twice its weight %0aof salt, and three times its weight of misy ; 70 after which it is %0aagain melted with two parts of salt and one of the stone called %0a" schistos." 71 Employed in this manner, it withdraws the %0anatural acridity from the substances torrefied with it in the %0acrucible, while at the same time it remains pure and incorrupt ; %0athe residue forming an ash which is preserved in an earthen %0avessel, and is applied with water for the cure of lichens on the %0aface : the best method of washing it off is with bean-meal. %0aThese ashes have the property also of curing fistulas and the %0adischarges known as "hsemorrhoides:" with the addition, too, ot %0apowdered pumice, they are a cure for putrid ulcers and sores %0awhich emit an offensive smell. %0a%0aGold, boiled in honey with melanthium 72 and applied as a %0aliniment to the navel, acts as a gentle purgative upon the %0abowels.

Native chrysocolla, known as "uva," differs from %0athe other in its hardness more particularly ; and yet, hard as %0ait is, it admits of being coloured with the plant known as %0a" lutum." 76 Like flax and wool, it is of a nature which imbibes %0aliquids. For the purpose of dyeing it, it is first bruised in a %0amortar, after which, it is passed through a fine sieve. This %0adone, it is ground, and then passed through a still finer sieve ; %0aall that refuses to pass being replaced in the mortar, and sub- %0ajected once more to the mill. The finest part of the powder is %0afrom time to time measured out into a crucible, where it is %0amacerated in vinegar, so that all the hard particles may be %0adissolved ; after which, it is pounded again, and then rinsed %0ain shell-shaped vessels, and left to dry. This done, the chry- %0asocolla is dyed by the agency of schist alum 77 and the plant %0aabove-mentioned ; and thus is it painted itself before it serves %0ato paint. It is of considerable importance, too, that it should %0abe absorbent and readily take the dye : indeed, if it does not %0aspeedily take the colour, scytanum and turbistum' 8 are added to %0athe dye ; such being the name of two drugs which compel it to %0aabsorb the colouring matter. %0a%0aCHAP. 27. THE USE MADE OF CHRYSOCOLLA IN PAINTING. %0a%0a_ When chrysocolla has been thus dyed, painters call it " oro- %0abitis," and distinguish two kinds of it, the cleansed 79 orobitis, 60 %0awhich is kept for making lomentum, 81 and the liquid, the balls %0a%0a76 The " Keseda luteola," Dyer's weed, or "Wild woad.

The great point of its ex- %0acellence consists in its producing exactly the tint of corn when %0ain a state of the freshest verdure. 84 Before now, we have seen, %0aat the spectacles exhibited by the Emperor Nero, the arena of %0athe Circus entirely sanded with chrysocolla, when the prince %0ahimself, clad in a dress of the same colour, was about to exhibit %0aas a charioteer. 85 %0a%0aThe unlearned multitude of artisans distinguish three %0akinds of chrysocolla ; the rough chrysocolla, which is valued %0aat seven denarii per pound ; the middling, worth five denarii ; %0aand the bruised, also known as the " herbaceous " chryso- %0acolla, worth three denarii per pound. Before laying on the %0asanded 88 chrysocolla, they underlay coats of atramentum 87 %0aand parsetonium, 88 substances which make it hold, and im- %0apart a softness to the colours. The parsetonium, as it is %0anaturally very unctuous, and, from its smoothness, extremely %0atenacious, is laid on first, and is then covered with a coat of %0aatramentum, lest the paraDtonium, from its extreme whiteness, %0ashould impart a paleness to the chrysocolla. The kind known %0aas "lutea," derives its name, it is thought, from the plant %0acalled " lutum ;" which itself is often pounded with cseru- %0aleum 89 instead of real chrysocolla, and used for painting, %0a%0apresent Chapter, and Chapter 57 of this Book.

In combina- %0ation with wax and oil, it is used as a detergent for wounds ; %0aand used by itself in the form of a powder, it acts as a desic- %0acative, and heals them. In cases, too, of quinsy and hardness %0aof breathing, chrysocolla is prescribed, in the form of an elec- %0atuary, with honey. It acts as an emetic also, and is used as an %0aingredient in eye-salves, for the purpose of effacing cicatriza- %0ations upon the eyes. In green plasters too, it is used, for %0asoothing pain and making scars disappear. This kind of %0achrysocolla 91 is known by medical men as "acesis," and is alto- %0agether different from orobitis. %0a%0aCHAP. 29. THE CHRTSOCOLLA OF THE GOLDSMITHS, KNOWN ALSO %0a%0aAS SANTERNA. %0a%0aThe goldsmiths also employ a chrysocolla 92 of their own, for %0athe purpose of soldering gold ; and it is from this chrysocolla, %0athey say, that all the other substances, which present a similar %0agreen, have received their name. This preparation is made %0afrom verdigris of Cyprian copper, the urine of a youth who %0ahas not arrived at puberty, and a portion of nitre. 93 It is then %0apounded with a pestle of Cyprian copper, in a copper mortar, %0aand the name given to the mixture is " santerna." It is in this %0away that the gold known as " silvery " 94 gold is soldered ; one %0asign of its being so alloyed being its additional brilliancy on %0athe application of santerna. If, on the other hand, the gold %0ais impregnated with copper, it will contract, on coming in %0acontact with the santerna, become dull, and only be soldered %0awith the greatest difficulty : indeed, for this last kind of gold, %0athere is a peculiar solder employed, made of gold and one- %0aseventh part of silver, in addition to the materials above-men- %0ationed, the whole beaten up together. %0a%0a90 As to durability, probablv. %0a%0a91 It was tbe mineral, probably, in an unprepared state. %0a%0a92 Gold-glue or gold- solder. %0a%0a9 3 See B. xxxi. c. 46, as to tbe " nitrum " of Pliny.

THE MARVELLOUS OPERATIONS OF NATURE IN SOLDERING %0a%0aMETALLIC SUBSTANCES, AND BRINGING THEM TO A STATE OP %0aPERFECTION. %0a%0aWhile speaking on this subject, it will be as well to annex %0athe remaining particulars, that our admiration may here be %0adrawn to all the marvels presented by Nature in connection %0atherewith. The proper solder for gold is that above described ; %0afor iron, potter's clay ; for copper, when in masses, cadmia, 9 * %0aand in sheets, alum ; for lead and marble, resin. Lead is also %0aunited by the aid of white lead ; K white lead with white lead, %0aby the agency of oil ; stannum, with copper file-dust ; and %0asilver, with stannum. 97 %0a%0aFor smelting copper and iron, pine-wood is the best, Egypt- %0aian papyrus being also very good for the purpose. Gold is %0amelted most easily with a fire made of chaff'. 98 Limestone %0aand Thracian stone" are ignited by the agency of water, this %0alast being extinguished by the application of oil. Fire, how- %0aever, is extinguished most readily by the application of vinegar, %0aviscus, 1 and unboiled eggs. Earth will under no circumstance %0aignite. When charcoal has been once quenched, and then again %0aignited, it gives out a greater heat than before. %0a%0aCHAP. 31. (6.)

Silver is never found but in %0ashafts sunk deep in the ground, there being no indications to %0araise hopes of its existence, no shining sparkles, as in the case %0aof gold.

When submitted, too, to the %0aaction of lire, part of the ore precipitates itself in the form of %0alead, 6 while the silver is left floating on the surface, 7 like oil %0aon water. %0a%0aSilver is found in nearly all our provinces, but the finest of %0aall is that of Spain ; where it is found, like gold, in unculti- %0avated soils, and in the mountains even. Wherever, too, one %0avein of silver has been met with, another is sure to be found %0anot far off : a thing that has been remarked, in fact, in the case %0aof nearly all the metals, which would appear from this cir- %0acumstance to have derived their Greek name of "metalla.'' 8 It %0ais a remarkable fact, that the shafts opened by Hannibal 9 in %0athe Spanish provinces are still worked, their names being de- %0arived from the persons who were the first to discover them. %0aOne of these mines, which at the present day is still called Bsebelo, %0afurnished Hannibal with three hundred pounds' weight of silver %0aper day. The mountain is already excavated for a distance of %0afifteen hundred 10 paces; and throughout the whole of this %0adistance there are water-bearers 11 standing night and day, %0abaling out the water in turns, regulated by the light of torches, %0aand so forming quite, a river. %0a%0aThe vein of silver that is found nearest the surface is known %0a%0a4 "Plumbum nigrum"— "Black lead," literally : so called by the ancients, %0ain contradistinction to "plumbum alburn," "white lead," our " tin," %0aprobably. %0a%0a5 Lead ore ; identified with " molybdaena " in B. xxxiv. c. 53. Native %0asulphurate of lead is now known as " galena." See Beckmann's Hist.

Of late, however, the discovery of %0aa vein of copper beneath alum, has withdrawn any such limits %0ato man's hopes. The exhalations from silver-mines are dan- %0agerous to all animals, but to dogs more particularly. The %0asofter they are, the more beautiful gold and silver are con- %0asidered. It is a matter of surprise with most persons, that lines %0atraced 15 with silver should be black. %0a%0aCHAP. 32. QUICKSILVER. %0a%0aThere is a mineral also found in these veins of silver, which %0ayields a humour that is always 16 liquid, and is known as %0a"quicksilver." 17 It acts as a poison 18 upon everything, and %0apierces vessels even, making its way through them by the %0aagency of its malignant properties. 19 AH substances float upon %0athe surface of quicksilver, with the exception of gold, 20 this %0abeing the only substance that it attracts to itself. 21 Hence %0ait is, that it is such an excellent refiner of gold ; for, on being %0abriskly shaken in an earthen vessel with gold, it rejects all %0athe impurities that are mixed with it. When once it has thus %0aexpelled these superfluities, there is nothing to do but to sepa- %0arate it from the gold ; to effect which, it is poured out upon %0askins that have been well tawed, and so, exuding through them %0alike a sort of perspiration, it leaves the gold in a state of %0apurity behind. 22 %0a%0a12 Meaning " raw" silver, apparently. %0a%0a13 " Alumen."

Beckmann has the following remarks on the present passage: %0a" That gold-leaf was affixed to metals by means of quicksilver, with the as- %0asistance of heat, in the time of Pliny, we are told by himself in more passages %0athan one. The metal to be gilded was prepared by salts of every kind, %0aand rubbed with pumice-stone in order to clean it thoroughly (see Chapter %0a20), and to render the surface a little rough. This process is similar to %0athat used at present for gilding with amalgam, by means of heat, especially %0aas amalgamation was known to the ancients. But, to speak the truth, %0aPliny says nothing of heating the metal after the gold is applied, or of %0aevaporating the quicksilver, but of drying the cleaned metal before the %0agold is laid on. Had he not mentioned quicksilver, his gilding might %0ahave been considered as that with gold leaf by means of heat, dorure en %0afeuille a feu, in which the gold is laid upon the metal after it has been %0acleaned and heated, and strongly rubbed with blood-stone, or polished steel. %0aFelibien (Principes de I' Architecture. Paris, 1676, p. 280) was undoubt- %0aedly right when he regretted that the process of the ancients, the excellence %0aof which is proved by remains of antiquity, has been lost." — Hist. Inv. %0aVol. II. pp. 294, 295. Bohn's Edition. %0a%0au Beckmann finds considerable difficulties in this description—" I ac- %0aknowledge that this passage I do not fully comprehend. It seems to say %0athat the quicksilver, when the gold was laid on too thin, appeared through %0ait, but that this might be prevented by mixing with the quicksilver the %0awhite of an egg. The quicksilver then remained under the gold: a thing %0awhich is impossible. When the smallest drop of quicksilver falls upon %0agilding, it corrodes the noble metal, and produces an empty spot. It is, %0atherefore, incomprehensible to me how this could be prevented by using %0athe white of an egg. Did Pliny himself completely understand gilding? %0aPerhaps he only meant to say that many artists gave out the cold-gildiug. %0awhere the gold-leaf was laid on with the white of an e^o- as oildino- bv %0ameans of heat."— Hist.

There are two kinds of it, %0athe male and the female. 23 The latter kind is the more ap- %0aproved of, the male 24 stimmi being more uneven, rougher to %0athe touch, less ponderous, not so radiant, and more gritty. %0aThe female kind, on the other hand, is bright and friable, and %0aseparates in laminae, and not in globules. 28 %0a%0aCHAP. 34.

He thinks it possible, also, that it may have %0aderived its Greek name " larbason," or " larbasis," from its brittleness. %0a%0a94 Ajasson thinks that under this name, crude antimony or sulphuret of %0aantimony may have been included ; as also sulphuret of lead, sulphuret of %0aantimony and copper, and sulphuret of antimony and silver ; the last ot %0awhich is often found covered with an opaque pellicle. %0a%0a25 " Globis."

The vessel into %0awhich the turbid part has been poured off, is then covered %0awith a linen cloth and left untouched for a night ; the portion %0athat lies upon the surface being poured off the following day, %0aor else removed with a sponge.

Others, again, bruise it %0ain water and then pass it through a triple strainer of linen %0acloth ; after which, they reject the lees, and pour off the %0aremainder of the liquid, collecting all that is deposited at the %0abottom, and using it as an ingredient in plasters and eye- salves. %0a%0aCHAP. 35. — THE SCORIA OF SILVEB.

It is employed also for the cure of %0atenesmus aDd dysentery, being injected in the form of a clyster %0awith myrtle-oil. It forms an ingredient, too, in the medica- %0aments known as " liparae," 36 for the removal of fleshy excres- %0acences in sores, ulcerations arising from chafing, or running %0aulcers on the head. %0a%0aThe same mines also furnish us with the preparation known %0aas " scum of silver." 37 There are three 38 varieties of it ; the %0abest, known as " chrysitis ;" the second best, the name of %0awhich is " argyritis ;" and a third kind, which is called %0a" molybditis." In most instances, too, all these tints are to %0abe found in the same cake. 39 %0a%0aThe most approved kind is that of Attica ; the next being %0athat which comes from Spain. Chrysitis is the produce of %0athe metallic vein, 40 argyritis is obtained from the silver itself, %0aand molybditis is the result of the smelting of lead, 41 a work %0athat is done at Puteoli ; to which last circumstance, in fact, mo- %0alybditis owes its name. 42 All' these substances are prepared in %0athe following manner : the metal is first melted, and then al- %0alowed to flow from a more elevated receiver into a lower. From %0athis last it is lifted by the aid of iron spits, and is then twirled %0around at the end of the spit in the midst of the flames, in %0aorder to make it all the lighter.

It differs %0afrom scoria in the same way that the scum of a liquid differs %0afrom the lees, the one 43 being an excretion thrown out by %0athe metal while purifying itself, the other* 4 an excretion of %0athe metal when purified. %0a%0aSome persons distinguish two kinds of scum of silver, and %0agive them the names of " scirerytis" and " peumene ;" 45 a third %0avariety being molybdaena, of which we shall have to make %0afurther mention when treating of lead. 46 To make this scum %0afit for use, the cakes are again broken into pieces the size %0aof a hazel-nut, and then melted, the fire being briskly blown %0awith the bellows. For the purpose of separating the charcoal %0aand ashes from it, it is then rinsed with vinegar or with wine, %0aand is so quenched. In the case of argyritis, it is recom- %0amended, in order to blanch it, to break it into pieces the size %0aof a bean, and then to boil it with water in an earthen vessel, %0afirst putting with it, wrapped in linen cloths, some new wheat %0aand barley, which are left there till they have lost the outer %0acoat. This done, they bruise the whole in mortars for six con- %0asecutive days, taking care to rinse the mixture in cold water %0athree times a day, and after that, in an infusion of hot %0awater and fossil salt, one obolus of the latter to every pound %0aof scum : at the end of the six days it is put away for keep- %0aing in a vessel of lead. %0a%0aSome persons boil it with white beans and a ptisan 47 of %0abarley, and then dry it in the sun ; others, again, with white %0awool and beans, till such time as it imparts no darkness to the %0awool ; after which, first adding fossil 48 salt, they change the %0awater from time to time, and then dry it during the forty hot- %0atest days of summer.

(7.) — MINIUM : FOR WHAT RELIGIOUS PURPOSES IT %0aWAS USED BY THE ANCIENTS. %0a%0aIt is also in silver-mines that minium 50 is found, a pigment %0aheld at the present day in very high estimation ; and by the %0aRomans in former times not only held in the highest estima- %0ation, but used for sacred purposes as well. Verrius enume- %0arates certain authors, upon whose testimony we find it satis- %0afactorily established that it was the custom upon festivals to %0acolour the face of the statue of Jupiter even with minium, as %0awell as the bodies 51 of triumphant generals ; and that it was %0ain this guise that Camillus celebrated his triumph. We find, %0atoo, that it is through the same religious motives that it is %0aemployed at the present day for colouring the unguents used %0aat triumphal banquets, and that it is the first duty of the %0acensors to make a contract for painting the statue of Jupiter" %0awith this colour. %0a%0aFor my own part, I am quite at a loss for the origin of this %0ausage ; but it is a well-known fact, that at the present day %0aeven, minium is in great esteem with the nations of ^Ethiopia, %0atheir nobles being in the habit of staining the body all over %0awith it, and this being the colour appropriated to the statues %0a%0a49 In this Chapter.

I shall therefore use all the more diligence in %0aenquiring into all the known facts respecting it. %0a%0aCHAP. 37. — THE DISCOVERT AND ORIGIN OF MINIUM. %0a%0aTheophrastus states that, ninety years before the magis- %0atracy of Praxibulus at Athens — a date which answers to the %0ayear of our City, 439 — minium was discovered by Callias the %0aAthenian, who was in hopes to extract gold, by submitting to %0athe action of fire the red sand that was found in the silver-mines. %0aThis, he says, was the first discovery of minium. He states, %0aalso, that in his own time, it was already found in Spain, but %0aof a harsh and sandy nature ; as also in Colchis, upon a cer- %0atain inaccessible rock there, from which it was brought down %0aby the agency of darts. This, however, he says, was only an %0aadulterated kind of minium, the best of all being that pro- %0acured in the Cilbian Plains, 53 above Ephesus, the sand of which %0ahas just the colour of the kermes berry. 54 This sand, he in- %0aforms us, is first ground to powder and then washed, the %0aportion that settles at the bottom being subjected to a second %0awashing. From this circumstance, he says, arises a difference %0ain the article ; some persons being in the habit of preparing %0atheir minium with a single washing, while with others it is %0amore diluted. The best kind, however, he says, is that which %0ahas undergone a second washing. %0a%0aCHAP. 38. CINNABARIS. %0a%0aI am not surprised that this colour should have been held %0ain such high esteem ; for already, in the days of the Trojan %0a"War, rubrica 55 was highly valued, as appears from the testi- %0amony of Homer, who particularly notices the ships that were %0acoloured with it, whereas, in reference to other colours and %0apaintings, he but rarely notices them. The Greeks call this %0ared earth "miltos," and give to minium the name of "cinna- %0abaris," and hence the error 56 caused by the two meanings of %0a%0as 3 See B. v. c. 31. 54 See B. xvi. c. 12, and B. xxiv. c. 4. %0a%0a55 The same as the miltos mentioned below, " miltos" being the word %0aused by Homer, II.

It %0ais our red ochre, peroxide of iron, mixed in a greater or less degree with %0aargillaceous earth. %0a%0as« See B. xxix. c. 8 ; where he speaks of the mistake made by the phy- %0asicians in giving mineral vermilion or minium to their patients instead of %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 40.] THE VARIOUS KINDS OF MINIUM. 121 %0a%0a%0a%0athe same word ; this being properly the name given to the %0athick matter which issues from the dragon when crushed be- %0aneath the weight of the dying elephant, mixed with the blood %0aof either animal, as already described." Indeed this last is the %0aonly colour that in painting gives a proper representation of %0ablood. This cinnabaris, too, is extremely useful as an ingre- %0adient in antidotes and various medicaments. But, by Her- %0acules ! our physicians, because minium also has the name of %0a" cinnabaris," use it as a substitute for the other, and so em- %0aploy a poison, as we shall shortly 58 show it to be. %0a%0aCnAP. 39. THE EMPLOYMENT OF CINNABARIS IN PAINTING. %0a%0aThe ancients used to paint with cinnabaris 59 those pictures %0aof one colour, which are still known among us as " monochro- %0amata." 60 They painted also with the minium of Ephesus : 61 %0abut the use of this last has been abandoned, from the vast %0atrouble which the proper keeping of the picture entailed. And %0athen besides, both these colours were thought to be too harsh ; %0athe consequence of which is, that painters have now adopted %0athe use of rubrica 62 and of sinopis, substances of which I shall %0amake further mention in the appropriate places. 63 %0a%0aCinnabaris 64 is adulterated by the agency of goats' blood, or %0aof bruised sorb-apples. The price of genuine cinnabaris is fifty %0asesterces per pound. %0a%0aCHAP. 40. THE VARIOUS KINDS OF MINIUM. THE USE MADE OF %0a%0aIT IN PAINTING. %0a%0aAccording to Juba minium is also a production of Carmania, 65 %0aand Timagenes says that it is found in ^Ethiopia. But from %0aneither of those regions is it imported to Borne, nor, indeed, %0a%0aIndian cinnabar. The latter substance is probably identical with that %0awhich is now used for varnishes, being imported from India, and still %0aknown as " dragons' blood," the resin of the Ptero-carpus draco, or Cala- %0amus palm. 57 In B. viii. c. 12. 68 In Chapter 41. %0a%0a59 The dragon's blood, mentioned in the preceding Chapter. %0a%0a60 " Single colour paintings."

Indeed there is nothing guarded with a more constant %0acircumspection ; for it is not allowable to reduce and refine %0athe ore upon the spot, it being brought to Rome in a crude %0astate and under seal, to the amount of about two thousand %0apounds per annum. At Eome, the process of washing is per- %0aformed, and, in the sale of it, the price is regulated by statute ; %0ait not being allowed to exceed 67 seventy sesterces per pound. %0aThere are numerous ways, however, of adulterating it, a source %0aof considerable plunder to the company. 68 %0a%0aFor there is, in fact, another kind 69 of minium, found in most %0asilver-mines as well as lead-mines, and prepared by the calcina- %0ation of certain stones that are found mixed with the metallic %0avein — not the minerals, however, to the fluid humours of %0awhich we have given 10 the name of quicksilver ; for if those are %0asubjected to the action of fire they will yield silver — but another %0akind of stone 7 ' that is found with them. These barren 72 stones, %0atoo, may be recognized by their uniform leaden colour, and it %0ais only when in the furnace that they turn red. After being %0aduly calcined they are pulverized, and thus form a minium of %0asecond-rate quality, known to but very few, and far inferior %0ato the produce of the native sand that we have mentioned." %0aIt is with this substance, then, as also with syricum, that %0athe genuine minium is adulterated in the manufactories of the %0acompany. How syricum is prepared we shall describe in the %0aappropriate place. 74 One motive, however, for giving an under- %0acoat of 6yricum to minium, is the evident saving of expense %0athat results therefrom.

In the mines of Sisapo, the veins are %0acomposed exclusively of the sandy particles of minium, with- %0aout the intermixture of any silver whatever ; the practice being %0ato melt it like gold. Minium is assayed by the agency of gold %0ain a state of incandescence : if it has been adulterated, it will %0aturn black, but if genuine, it retains its colour. I find it %0astated also that minium is adulterated with lime ; the proper %0amode of detecting which, is similarly to employ a sheet of red %0ahot iron, if there should happen to be no gold at hand. %0a%0aTo objects painted with minium the action of the sun and %0amoon is highly injurious. The proper method of avoiding %0athis inconvenience, is to dry the wall, and then to apply, with %0aa hair brush, hot Punic wax, melted with oil ; after which, %0athe varnish must be heated, with an application of gall-nuts, %0aburnt to a red heat, till it quite perspires. This done, it must %0abe smoothed down with rollers 77 made of wax, and then polish- %0aed with clean linen cloths, like marble, when made to shine. %0aPersons employed in the manufactories in preparing minium %0aprotect the face with masks of loose bladder-skin, in order to %0aavoid inhaling the dust, which is highly pernicious ; the cover- %0aing being at the same time sufficiently transparent to admit of %0abeing seen through. %0a%0aMinium is employed also for writing 78 in books ; and the %0aletters made with it being more distinct, even on gold or mar- %0able, it is used for the inscriptions upon tombs. %0a%0a75 When hired by the job for colouring walls or objects of art.

REMEDIES DERIVED FROM %0aMINIUM. %0a%0aHuman industry has also discovered a method of extracting %0ahydrargyros 79 from the inferior minium, a substitute for quick- %0asilver, the further mention of which was deferred, a few pages %0abefore, 80 to the present occasion. There are two methods of %0apreparing this substance ; either by pounding minium and %0avinegar with a brazen pestle and mortar, or else by putting %0aminium into flat earthen pans, covered with a lid, and then %0aenclosed in an iron seething-pot well luted with potter's clay. %0aA fire is then lighted under the pans, and the flame kept con- %0atinually burning by the aid of the bellows ; which done, the %0aSteam is carefully removed, that is found adhering to the lid, %0abeing like silver in colour, and similar to water in its fluidity. %0aThis liquid, too, is easily made to separate in globules, which, %0afrom their fluid nature, readily unite. 81 %0a%0aAs it is a fact generally admitted, that minium is a poison, 82 %0aI look upon all the recipes given as highly dangerous which %0arecommend its employment for medicinal purposes ; with the %0aexception, perhaps, of those cases in which it is applied to the %0ahead or abdomen, for the purpose of arresting haemorrhage, %0adue care being taken that it is not allowed to penetrate to the %0aviscera, or to touch any sore. Beyond such cases as these, for %0amy own part, I should never recommend it to be used in %0amedicine. %0a%0aCHAP. 42. THE METHOD OF GILDING SILVER. %0a%0aAt the present day silver is gilded almost exclusively by %0athe agency of hydrargyros j 83 and a similar method should %0aalways be employed in laying gold leaf upon copper. But %0athe same fraud which ever shows itself so extremely inge- %0anious in all departments of human industry, has devised a %0a%0a79 Or artificial quicksilver. In reality, hydrargyrus is prepared from the %0agenuine minium of Pliny, the cinnabar mentioned in Chapter 36 : it being %0aobtained by the sublimation of 6ulphuret of mercury %0a%0a80 In Chapters 20 and 32. %0a%0a81 This, probably, is the meaning of " lubrico humore comnluere " %0a83 See the end of Chapter 38. r %0a%0a83 Artificial quicksilver is still used for this purpose.

By some persons it is known as %0athe " Heraclian," and by others as the "Lydian" stone. It %0ais found in pieces of moderate size, and never exceeding four %0ainches in length by two in breadth. The side that has lain %0afacing the sun is superior 87 to that which has lain next to the %0aground. Persons of experience in these matters, when they %0ahave scraped a particle off the ore with this stone, as -with a %0afile, can tell in a moment the proportion of gold there is in it, %0ahow much silver, or how much copper ; and this to a scruple, %0atheir accuracy being so marvellous that they are never mis- %0ataken. %0a%0aCHAP. 44. THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF SILVER, AND THE MODES %0a%0aOP TESTING IT. %0a%0aThere are two kinds of silver. On placing a piece of it %0aupon an iron fire-shovel at a white heat, if the metal remains %0aperfectly white, it is of the best quality : if again it turns of a %0areddish colour, it is inferior ; but if it becomes black, it is %0aworthless. Fraud, however, has devised means of stultifying %0athis test even ; for by keeping the shovel immersed in men's %0aurine, the piece of silver absorbs it as it burns, and so displays %0aa fictitious whiteness. There is also a kind of test with %0areference to polished silver : when the human breath comes %0a%0a81 In Chapter 32. He alludes to the use of glair of eggs. %0a%0a85 Literally " whetstone." He is speaking of the stone known to us as %0aTouchstone, Lydian stone, or Basanite — "a velvet-black siliceous stone or %0aflinty jasper, used on account of its hardness and black colour for trying %0athe purity of the precious metals. The colour left on the stone after rub- %0abing the metal across it, indicates to the experienced eye the amount of %0athe alloy." — Dana, Syst. Mineral, p. 242. %0a%0a86 In Lydia. See B. v. cc. 30, 31. %0a%0a87 As a test. At the present day, concentrated nitric acid is dropped on %0athe mark left by the metal ; and the more readily the mark is effaced, the %0aless pure is the metal. %0a%0a%0a%0a126 %0a%0a%0a%0apunt's natural history. %0a%0a%0a%0a[Book XXXIII. %0a%0a%0a%0ain contact with it, it should immediately be covered with %0asteam, 98 the cloudiness disappearing at once. %0a%0achap. 45. (9.) — jinatoits. %0a%0aIt is generally supposed among us that it is only the very %0afinest silver that admits of being laminated, and so converted %0ainto mirrors. Pure silver was formerly used for the purpose, %0abut, at the present day, this too has been corrupted by the %0adevices of fraud. But, really, it is a very marvellous property %0athat this metal has, of reflecting objects ; a property which, it %0ais generally agreed, results from the repercussion of the air, 69 %0athrown back as it is from the metal upon the eyes. The %0asame too is the action that takes place when we use a mirror. %0aIf, again, a thick plate of this metal is highly polished, and is %0arendered slightly concave, 90 the image or object reflected is %0aenlarged to an immense extent ; so vast is the difference be- %0atween a surface receiving, 91 and throwing back the air. Even %0amore than this — drinking-cups are now made in such a %0amanner, as to be filled inside with numerous 92 concave facets, %0alike so many mirrors ; so that if but one person looks into the %0ainterior, he sees reflected a whole multitude of persons. %0a%0aMirrors, too, have been invented to reflect monstrous 93 %0aforms ; those, for instance, which have been consecrated in the %0aTemple at Smyrna. This, however, all results from the con- %0afiguration given to the metal ; and it makes all the difference %0awhether the surface has a concave form like the section of a %0adrinking cup, or whether it is [convex] like a Thracian 94 %0abuckler ; whether it is depressed in the middle or elevated ; %0awhether the surface has a direction 95 transversely or ob- %0aliquely ; or whether it runs horizontally or vertically ; the %0apeculiar configuration of the surface which receives the shadows, %0a%0a38 This seems to be the meaning of " si sudet pvotinus." %0a%0a89 A very far-fetched explanation, and very wide of the mark. %0a%0a90 « p au i um propulsa." %0a%0a91 Which he supposes a concave surface to do. %0a%0a92 This passage is noticed by Beckniana, in his account of Mirrors ; %0aVol. II. p. 58.

More recently, 2 a notion has arisen %0athat the object is reflected with greater distinctness, by the %0aapplication to the back of the mirror of a layer of gold. 3 %0a%0a98 A subject to which, he returns iu various parts of B. xxxvi. %0a%0a97 See B. xxxiv. c. 48. %0a%0a98 As to the identification of "stannum," on which there have been %0agreat differences of opinion, see B. xxxiv. cc. 47, 48, and the Notes. %0a%0a99 For some account of this artist, see Chapter 55 and the Notes at the %0aend of this Book. %0a%0a1 " Silver mirrors were known long before this period, as is proved by %0aa passage in the Mostellaria of Plautus, A. 1, S. 3, 1. 101, where they are %0adistinctly mentioned. To reconcile this contradiction, Meursius remarks %0athat Pliny speaks only of his countrymen, and not of the Greeks, who had %0asuch articles much earlier, though the scene in Plautus is at Athens." — %0aBeckmann, Hist. Inv. Vol. II. p. 62. Bohn's Edition. %0a%0a2 " Nuper credi coeptum certiorem imaginem reddi auro opposite %0aaversis." — " Of what Pliny says here I can give no explanation. Har- %0adouin (qy. if not Dalechamps ?) is of opinion that mirrors, according to the %0anewest invention, at that period were covered behind with a plate of gold, %0aas our mirrors are with an amalgam. But as the ancient plates of silver %0awere not transparent, how could the gold at the back of them produce any %0aeffect in regard to the image ? May not the meaning be that a thin plate %0aof gold was placed at some distance before the mirror, in order to throw %0amore light upon its surface ? "Whatever may have been the case, Pliny %0ahimselfcseems not to have had much confidence in the invention." — Beck- %0amann, Hist. Inv. Vol. II. p. 62. %0a%0a3 Dr. Watson (Chemical Essays, Vol. IV. p. 246) seems to think that %0aPliny is here speaking of glass mirrors : " If we admit that Pliny was %0aacquainted with glass mirrors, we may thus understand what he says %0arespecting an invention which was then new, of applying gold behind a %0amirror. Instead of an amalgam of tin, some one had proposed to cover %0athe back of the mirror with an amalgam of gold, with which the ancients %0awere certainly acquainted, and which they employed in gilding." See %0aChapter 20 of the present Hook. On the above passage by Dr. Watson, %0aUcckmann has the following remarks: " This conjecture appears, at any %0arate, to be ingenious ; but when I read the passage again, without pre- %0ajudice, I can hardly believe that Pliny alludes to a plate of glass in aplace %0awhere he speaks only of metallic mirrors; and the overlaying with amal- %0agam requires too much art to allow me to ascribe it to such a period with- %0a%0a%0a%0a128 %0a%0a%0a%0aplint's natural history. %0a%0a%0a%0a[Book XXXIII. %0a%0a%0a%0aCHAP 46. — EGYPTIAN SILVER. %0a%0aThe people of Egypt stain their silver vessels, that they %0amay see represented in them their god Anubis ; 4 and it is the %0acustom with them to paint, 6 and not to chase, their silver. %0aThis usage has now passed to our own triumphal statues even; %0aand, a truly marvellous fact, the value of silver has been %0aenhanced by deadening its brilliancy. 6 The following is the %0amethod adopted : with the silver are mixed two- thirds of the %0avery finest Cyprian copper, that known as " coronarium,'" %0aand* a proportion of live sulphur equal to that of the silver. %0aThe whole of these are then melted in an earthen vessel well %0aluted with potter's clay, the operation being completed when %0athe cover becomes detached from the vessel. Silver admits %0aalso of being blackened with the yolk of a hard-boiled egg ; a %0atint, however, which is removed by the application of vinegar %0aand chalk. %0a%0aThe Triumvir Antonius alloyed the silver denarius with %0airon : and in spurious coin there is an alloy of copper em- %0aployed. Some, again, curtail 8 the proper weight of our de- %0anarii, the legitimate proportion being eighty-four denarii to a %0apound of silver. It was in consequence of these frauds that a %0amethod was devised of assaying the denarius : the law ordain- %0aing which was so much to the taste of the plebeians, that in %0aevery quarter of the City there was a full - length statue %0aerected 9 in honour of Marius Gratidianus. It is truly mar- %0avellous, that in this art, and in this only, the various methods %0aof falsification should be made a study : 10 for the sample of %0a%0aout sufficient proof. I consider it more probable, tbat some person had %0atried, by means of a polished plate of gold, to collect the rays of light, and %0ato throw them either on the mirror qt the object, in order to render the %0aimage brighter." — Hist.

(10.) INSTANCES OF IMMENSE WEALTH. PERSONS %0a%0aWHO HAVE POSSESSED THE GREATEST SUMS OF MONEY. %0a%0aThe ancients had no number whereby to express a larger %0asum than one hundred thousand ; and hence it is that, at %0athe present day, we reckon by multiples of that number, as, %0afor instance, ten times one hundred thousand, and so on. 11 For %0athese multiplications we are indebted to usury and the use of %0acoined money ; and hence, too, the expression " ses alienum," %0aor " another man's money," which we still use. 12 In later %0atimes, again, the surname "Dives" 13 was given to some: only %0abe it known to all, that the man who first received this sur- %0aname became a bankrupt and so bubbled his creditors. 14 M. %0aCrassus, 15 a member of the same family, used to say that no %0aman was rich, who could not maintain a legion upon his yearly %0aincome. He possessed in land two hundred millions 16 of %0asesterces, being the richest Roman citizen next to Sylla. Nor %0awas even this enough for him, but he must want to possess all %0athe gold of the Parthians too !" And yet, although he was the %0afirst to become memorable for his opulence — so pleasant is the %0atask of stigmatizing this insatiate cupidity — we have known %0aof many manumitted slaves, since his time, much more %0awealthy than he ever was ; three for example, all at the same %0a%0asold for the purpose of showing the difference between it and the genuine %0acoin. %0a%0a11 Twenty times one hundred thousand, &c. %0a%0a11 As signifying a " debt owing to another." 13 "The Rich." %0a%0a14 This seems the best translation for " decoxisse creditoribus suis," %0awhich literally means that he "boiled " or " melted away" his fortune from %0ahis creditors. In this remark Pliny is more witty than usual. %0a%0a15 The Triumvir. The first person mentioned in Roman history as %0abaring the cognomen " Dives," is P. Licinius Crassus, the personage %0amentioned in B. xxi. c. 4. As he attained the highest honours of the %0astate, and died universally respected, he cannot be the person so oppro- %0abriously spoken of by Pliny. %0a%0a16 The meaning appears to be doubtful here, as it is not clear whether %0a" sesterces," or " sestertia," " thousands of sesterces," is meant. %0a%0a17 Who cut off his head after his death, and poured molten gold down %0ahis throat. %0a%0aVOL.

Upon %0athis, Xerxes had the youth put to death, and his body cut in two, the armv %0abeing ordered to march between the portions, which were placed on either %0aside of the road.

Such was the sum %0atotal of the silver possessed by the whole of the inhabitants of %0aCarthage, that rival of Rome for the empire of the world ! %0aHow many a Roman since then has surpassed her in his dis- %0aplay of plate for a single table ! After the destruction of %0aNumantia, the same Africanus gave to his soldiers, on the %0aday of his triumph, a largess of seven denarii each — and right %0aworthy were they of such a general, when satisfied with such %0aa sum ! His brother, Scipio Allobrogicus, 34 was the very %0afirst who possessed one thousand pounds' weight of silver, %0a%0a50 " Asperitatemque exciso circa liniarum picturas,"— a passage, the %0aobscurity of which, as Littre remarks, seems to set translation at defiance. %0a%0a31 He alludes, probably to tiers of shelves on the beaufets or sideboards %0a— " repositoria "—similar to those used for the display of plate in the %0amiddle ages. Petronius Arbiter speaks of a round " repositorium," %0awhich seems to have borne a considerable resemblance to our " dumb %0awaiters." The " repositoria " here alluded to by Pliny were probably %0amade of silver. »2 " Interradimus." %0a%0a33 "Carrucae."

As to the fact that an ancient warrior, 35 a man, %0atoo, who had enjoyed a triumph, should have incurred the notice %0aof the censor for being in possession of five pounds' weight of %0asilver, it is a thing that would appear quite fabulous at the %0apresent day. 36 The same, too, with the instance of Catus %0a-%3cElius, 37 who, when consul, after being found by the JEtolian %0aambassadors taking his morning meaP off of common earthen- %0aware, refused to receive the silver vessels which they sent him ; %0aand, indeed, was never in possession, to the last day of his %0alife, of any silver at all, with the exception of two drinking- %0acups, which had been presented to him as the reward of his %0avalour, by L. Paulus, 39 his father-in-law, on the conquest of %0aKing Perseus. %0a%0aWe read, too, that the Carthaginian ambassadors declared %0athat no people lived on more amicable terms among them- %0aselves than the Romans, for that wherever they had dined %0athey had always met with the same 40 silver plate.

[Book XXXIII. %0a%0a%0a%0aCHAP. 51. — AT WHAT PERIOD SILVER WAS FIRST USED A8 AN %0aOKNAMENT FOB COUCHES. %0a%0aFor this long time past, however, it has been the fashion to %0aplate the couches of our women, as well as some of our ban- %0aquetting-couches, 43 entirely with silver. Carvilius Pollio, 44 a %0aRoman of equestrian rank, was the first, it is said, to adorn %0athese last with silver ; not, I mean, to plate them all over, nor %0ayet to make them after the Delian pattern ; the Punic 45 fashion %0abeing the one he adopted. It was after this last pattern too, %0athat he had them ornamented with gold as well : and it was %0anot long after his time that silver couches came into fashion, %0ain imitation of the couches of Delos. All this extravagance, %0ahowever, was fully expiated by the civil wars of Sulla. %0a%0aCHAP. 52. AT WHAT PERIOD SILVER CHARGEES OF ENORMOUS %0a%0aSIZE WERE FIRST MADE. WHEN SILVER WAS FIRST USED AS %0aA MATERIAL FOR SIDEBOARDS. WHEN THE SIDEBOARDS CALLED %0aTYMPANA WERE FIRST INTRODUCED. %0a%0aIn fact, it was but very shortly before that period that these %0acouches were invented, as well as chargers 46 of silver, one %0ahundred pounds in weight : of which last, it is a well-known %0afact, that there were then upwards of one hundred and fifty in %0aRome, and that many persons were proscribed through the %0adevices of others who were desirous to gain possession thereof. %0aWell may our Annals be put to the blush for having to impute %0athose civil wars to the existence of such vices as these ! %0a%0aOur own age, however, has waxed even stronger in this %0arespect. In the reign of Claudius, his slave Drusillanus, %0asurnamed Rotundus, who acted as his steward 47 in Nearer %0aSpain, possessed a silver charger weighing five hundred %0apounds, for the manufacture of which a workshop had had to be %0aexpressly built. This charger was accompanied also by eight %0aother dishes, each two hundred and fifty pounds in weight. %0aHow many of his fellow-slaves, 48 pray, would it have taken to %0aintroduce these dishes, or who 49 were to be the guests served %0atherefrom ? %0a%0a« " Triclinia."

Fenestella, who died at the %0aend of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, informs us that at that %0aperiod sideboards, inlaid even with tortoiseshell, 50 * had come %0ainto fashion ; whereas, a little before his time, they had been %0amade of solid wood, of a round shape, and not much larger %0athan our tables. He says, however, that when he was quite %0aa boy, they had begun to make the sideboards square, and of %0adifferent 51 pieces of wood, or else veneered with maple or %0acitrus : 52 and that at a later period the fashion was introduced %0aof overlaying the corners and the seams at the joinings with %0asilver. The name given to them in his youth, he says, was %0a" tympana ;" 53 and it was at this period, too, that the chargers %0awhich had been known as " magides" by the ancients, first %0areceived the name of " lances," from their resemblance 54 to the %0ascales of a balance. %0a%0aCHAT. 53. — THE ENOEMOTJS TEICE OF SILVEE PLATE. %0a%0aIt is not, however, only for vast quantities of plate that there %0ais such a rage among mankind, but even more so, if possible, %0afor the plate of peculiar artists : and this too, to the exculpa- %0ation of our own age, has long been the case. C. Gracchus %0apossessed some silver dolphins, for which he paid five thou- %0asand sesterces per pound. Lucius Crassus, the orator, paid %0afor two goblets chased by the hand of the artist Mentor, 55 one %0ahundred thousand sesterces : but he confessed that for very %0ashame he never dared use them, as also that he had other %0aarticles of plate in his possession, for which he had paid at %0athe rate of six thousand sesterces per pound.

We learn, however, from Chapter %0a55 of this Book, that he flourished before the burning of the Temple of %0aDiana at Ephesus, b.c. 356. He is frequently mentioned in the classical %0awriters. See also B. vii. c. 39. %0a%0a56 He includes, probably, under this name both Asia Minor and Syria. %0aBee a similar passage in Livy, B. xxxix. %0a%0a%0a%0a136 %0a%0a%0a%0apliny's natural histoet. [Book XXXIII. %0a%0a%0a%0afind that Lucius Scipio, in his triumphal procession, exhibited %0aone thousand four hundred pounds' weight of chased silver, %0awith golden vessels, the weight of which amounted to one %0athousand five hundred pounds. This 57 took place in the year %0afrom the foundation of the City, 565. But that which in- %0aflicted a still more severe blow upon the Roman morals, was %0athe legacy of Asia, 58 which King Attalus 59 left to the state at %0ahis decease, a legacy which was even more disadvantageous %0athan the victory of Scipio, 60 in its results. For, upon this %0aoccasion, all scruple was entirely removed, by the eagerness %0awhich existed at Home, for making purchases at the auction %0aof the king's effects. This took place in the year of the City, %0a622, the people having learned, during the fifty-seven years %0athat had intervened, not only to admire, but to covet even, %0athe opulence of foreign nations. The tastes of the Roman %0apeople had received, too, an immense impulse from the con- %0aquest of Achaia, 61 which, during this interval, in the year of %0athe City, 608, that nothing might be wanting, had introduced %0aboth statues and pictures. The same epoch, too, that saw the %0abirth of luxury, witnessed the downfall of Carthage ; so that, %0aby a fatal coincidence, the lloman people, at the same mo- %0ament, both acquired a taste for vice and obtained a license %0afor gratifying it. %0a%0aSome, too, of the ancients sought to recommend themselves %0aby this love of excess ; for Caius Marius, after his victory over %0athe Cimbri, drank from a cantharus, 62 it is said, in imitation %0aof Father Liber f Marius, that ploughman 64 of Arpinum, a %0ageneral who had risen from the ranks ! 65 %0a%0aCHAP. 54.

But %0aof what use is it to collect all these instances, when our very %0asoldiers, holding ivory even in contempt, have the hilts of %0atheir swords made of chased silver ? when, too, their scabbards %0aare heard to jingle with their silver chains, and their belts %0awith the plates of silver with which they are inlaid ? %0a%0aAt the present day, too, the continence of our very pages is %0asecured by the aid of silver : 72 our women, when bathing, %0aquite despise any sitting-bath that is not made of silver : %0awhile for serving up food at table, as well as for the most %0aunseemly purposes, the same metal must be equally employed ! %0a"Would that Fabricius could behold these instances of lux- %0auriousness, the baths of our women — bathing as they do in %0a%0a66 Meaning the first king of that name.

Plutarch speaks %0aof another statue of the same king, exhibited by Lucullus, six feet in %0aheight. 68 " Compedes." See Chapter 12 of this Book. %0a%0a69 The translation of this passage is somewhat doubtful. We will, there- %0afore, subjoin that of Holland, who adopts the other version. " As we %0amay see by our proud and sumptuous dames, that are but commoners and %0aartizans' wives, who are forced to make themselves carquans and such or- %0anaments for their shoes, of silver, because the rigour of the statute pro- %0avided in that case will not permit them to weare the same of gold." %0a%0a70 A rhetorician who taught at Rome in the reign of Augustus.

The greatest %0arenown, however, has been acquired by Mentor, of whom %0amention has been made already. 74 Four pairs [of vases] were %0aall that were ever 75 made by him ; and at the present day, not %0aone of these, it is said, is any longer in existence, owing to %0athe conflagrations of the Temple of Diana at Ephesus and of %0athat in the Capitol. 76 Varro informs us in his writings that he %0aalso was in possession of a bronze statue, the work of this %0aartist. Next to Mentor, the most admired artists were Acra- %0a%0a73 " Videret hinc dona fortium fieri, aut in haec frangi." %0a%0a74 In B. vii. c. 39, and in Chapter 53 of this Book. %0a%0a75 " Quatuor paria ab eo omnino facta sunt." Sillig, in his Dictionary %0aof Ancient Artists, finds a difficulty in this passage. "The term 'om- %0anino ' seems to imply that the productions in question, all of which perished, %0awere the only works executed by this artist ; but we find several passages %0aof ancient writers, in which vases, &c. engraved by Mentor, are mentioned %0aas extant. Thus, then, we must conclude, either that the term ' omnino ' %0ashould be understood in the sense of ' chiefly,' ' pre-eminently/ or that the %0aindividuals claiming to possess works of Mentor, were themselves misin- %0aformed, or endeavoured to deceive others." If, however, we look at the %0aword "paria " in a strictly technical sense, the difficulty will probably he %0aremoved. Pliny's meaning seems to be that Mentor made four pairs and %0ano more, of some peculiar kind of vessel probably, and that all these %0apairs were now lost. He does not say that Mentor did not make other %0aworks of art, in single pieces. Thiersch, Act. Acad. Monac v p 128 ex %0apresses an opinion that the word "omnino" is a corruption and that in %0ait lies concealed the name of the kind of plate that is meant %0a%0a76 See B. vii. c. 39. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 55.] %0a%0a%0a%0aMOST FAMOUS ABTISTS IN" SILVER. %0a%0a%0a%0a139 %0a%0a%0a%0agas, 77 Boethus, 78 and Mys. 79 Works of all these artists are still %0aextant in the Isle of Rhodes ; of Bcethus, in the Temple of %0aMinerva, at Lindus; of Acragas, in the Temple of Father %0aLiber, at Rhodes, consisting of cups engraved with figures in %0arelief of Centaurs and Bacchantes ; and of Mys, in the same %0atemple, figures of Sileni and Cupids.

He is mentioned also by Propertius, Martial, and Statius. %0a%0a80 His birth-place is unknown, but he probably lived about the time of %0aPhidias, and we learn from Pausanias that he was living when the plague %0aceased at Athens, in B.C. 429.

Sil is, properly speak- %0aing, a sort of slime. 2 The best kind is that known as Attic %0asil ; the price of which is two denarii per pound. The next best %0akind is the marbled 3 sil, the price of which is half that of the %0aAttic kind. A third sort is the compressed sil, known to some %0apersons as Scyric sil, it coming from the Isle of Scyros. %0aThen, too, there is the sil of Achaia, which painters make use %0aof for shadow-painting, and the price of which is two sesterces %0aper pound.

This last kind, as well as %0athe Attic sil, is used for painting strong lights : but the mar- %0abled sil only is employed for colouring compartitions, 5 the %0amarble in it offering a resistance to the natural acridity of the %0alime. This last kind is extracted also from some mountains %0atwenty miles distant from the City. When thus extracted, %0ait is submitted to the action of fire ; in which form it is adul- %0aterated by some, and 6old for compressed sil. That it has been %0aburnt, however, and adulterated, may be very easily detected by %0aits acridity, and the fact that it very soon crumbles into dust. %0a%0aPolygnotus 6 and Micon 7 were the first to employ sil in %0apainting, but that of Attica solely. The succeeding age used %0athis last kind for strong lights only, and employed the Scyric %0aand Lydian kinds for shadow painting. The Lydian sil used %0ato be bought at Sardes ; but at the present day we hear %0anothing of it. %0a%0aCHAP. 57. (13.) — CiERTJLEUM. %0a%0aCseruleum 8 is a kind of sand.

" Pliny clearly adds to it an artificial colour, which in my %0aopinion was made in the same manner as our lake ; for he speaks of an %0aearth, which when boiled with plants, acquired their blue colour." — Hist. %0aInv., Vol. II. p. 4S0. %0a%0a11 Supposed by Hardouin to have been " glastum " or " woad," the Isatis %0atinctoria of Linnaeus, mentioned in B. xxii. c. 2. %0a%0a12 " In sua coquitur herba." %0a%0a13 A blue powder ; see Chapter 27 of this Book. Beckmann has the %0afollowing remarks on this and the preceding lines : " The well-known %0apassage of Pliny in which Lehmann thinks he can with certainty discover %0acobalt, is so singular a medley that nothing to be depended on can be %0agathered from it. The author, it is true, where he treats of mineral pig- %0aments, seems to speak of a blue sand which produced different shades of %0ablue paint, according as it was pounded coarser or finer. The palest powder %0awas called lomentum, and this Lehmann considers as our powder-blue. I %0aam, however, fully convinced that the cyanus of Theophrastus, the caruleum %0aof Pliny, and the chrysocolla (see Chapter 26), were the blue copper earth %0aalready mentioned, whicb may have been mixed and blended together.'' — %0aHist. Inv. Vol. I. pp. 480, 481. Bohn's Edition. %0a%0a14 According to Vitruvius, B. vii. c. 11, the manufactory of Vestorius %0awas at Puteoli, now Pozzuoli. This was probably the same C. Vestorius %0awho was also a money-lender and a friend of Atticus, and with whom %0aCicero had monetary transactions. He is mentioned as " Vestorium raeura," %0ain the Epistles of Cicero to Atticus. %0a%0a15 For colouring surfaces of clay or cretaceous earth. This kind was also %0amanufactured by Vesturius, most probably. %0a%0a15 " Idem et Puteolani usus, praeterque ad fenestras." " The expression %0ahere, usus ad fenestras, has been misapplied by Lehmann, as a strong proof %0aof his assertion; for he explained it as if Pliny had said that a blue pig- %0ament was used for painting window-frames ; but glass windows were at %0athat time unknown. I suspect that Pliny meant to say only that one %0akind of paint could not be employed near openings whicb afforded a %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 58.] %0a%0a%0a%0aREMEDIES DEBITED FEOM C-SRULETJM. %0a%0a%0a%0a113 %0a%0a%0a%0aIt is not so long since that indicum 17 was first imported to %0aRome, the price being seventeen 18 denarii per pound.

There is also a lomentum of very in- %0aferior quality, known to us as " ground" lomentum, and valued %0aat only five asses per pound. %0a%0aThe mode of testing the genuineness of caeruleum, is to see %0awhether it emits a flame, on being laid upon burning coals. %0aOne method of adulterating it is to boil dried violets in water, %0aand then to strain the liquor through linen into Eretrian 20 %0aclay. %0a%0aCHAP. 58. TWO REMEDIES DERIVED FROM OERTTLEUM. %0a%0aCaeruleum has the medicinal property of acting as a deter- %0agent upon ulcers. Hence it is, that it is used as an ingredient %0ain plasters, as also in cauteries. As to sil, it is pounded with %0athe greatest difficulty : viewed as a medicament, it is slightly %0amordent and astringent, and fills up the cavities left by ulcers. %0aTo make it the more serviceable, it is burnt in earthen %0avessels. %0a%0aThe prices of things, which I have in different places %0aannexed, vary, I am well aware, according to the locality, and %0aexperience a change almost every year: variations dependent %0aupon the opportunities afforded for navigation, and the terms %0aupon which the merchant may have purchased the article. It %0amay so happen, too, that some wealthy dealer has engrossed %0athe market, and so enhanced the price : for I am by no means %0aforgetful of the case of Demetrius, who in the reign of the %0aEmperor Nero was accused before the consuls by the whole %0acommunity of the Seplasia. 21 Still, however, I have thought %0a%0apassage to the light, as it soon decayed and lost its colour.

Sillig expresses an %0aopinion that Pliny may possibly have borrowed something from his works, %0aand inserted his name, with a view of pleasing the young prince and his %0afather, the Emperor Vespasian. %0a%0a23 He is quoted in Chapter 9 of this Book, where it appears that he took %0ahis cognomen on account of his friendship for C. Gracchus. He wrote a %0awork, " De Potestatibus," which gave an account of the Roman magistrates %0afrom the time of the kings.

His constitution, how- %0aever, was early exhausted, and he died in his 35th or 36th year, leaving %0abehind him twenty-one orations. We learn from Cicero and Quintilian %0athat his compositions were carefully moulded after the models of the Attic %0aschool, but were deficient in ease and freshness. As a poet he was the %0aauthor of many short pieces, equally remarkable for their looseness and %0aelegance.

(1.) — METALS. %0a%3c %0a%3c "We are now about to speak of metals, of actual wealth, 1 ' %0a%3c the standard of comparative value, objects for which we dili- %0a%3c gently search, within the earth, in numerous ways. In one %0a%3c place, for instance, we undermine it for the purpose of obtaining %0a%3c riches, to supply the exigencies of life, searching for either %0a%3c gold or silver, electrum 2 or copper. 3 In another place, to %0a%3c satisfy the requirements of luxury, our researches extend to %0a%3c gems and pigments, with which to adorn our fingers 4 and the %0a%3c walls of our houses : while in a third place, we gratify Our %0a%3c rash propensities by a search for iron, which, amid wars and %0a%3c carnage, is deemed more acceptable even than gold. We trace %0a%3c out all the veins of the earth, and yet, living upon it, under- %0a%3c mined as it is beneath our feet, are astonished that it should oc- %0a%3c casionally cleave asunder or tremble : as though, forsooth, these %0a%3c %0a%3c 1 We now enter upon the Sixth division of Pliny's work, containing an %0a%3c account of mineral substances of all descriptions. — Dr. Bostock. %0a%3c %0a%3c l * " Ipsae opes." The metals were looked upon by the ancients as the %0a%3c only true riches. It is in this sense that Ovid says, Metam. B. i. : " Effo- %0a%3c diuntur opes, irritamenta malorum." Pliny applies the term " pretia re- %0a%3c rum" to metals, as forming the unit of value. %0a%3c %0a%3c 2 Electrum is described in c. 23, as gold mixed with a certain quan- %0a%3c tity of silver. The word " electrum " is also used to signify amber, as in %0a%3c B. iii. c. 30. — B. %0a%3c %0a%3c 3 ".5Ss ;" by " aes" is here probably meant copper, as the author is speaking %0a%3c of what is dug out of the earth ; it is more fully described in the first two %0a%3c Chapters of the next Book. According to the analysis of Klaproth, the %0a%3c tes of the ancients, when employed in works of art, cutting instruments, %0a%3c statues, vases, &c, was the " bronze " of the moderns, a mixture of copper %0a%3c and tin, in which the proportion of tin varied, from a little more than 2 %0a%3c to 1.14 per cent, according as the object was to procure a flexible or a %0a%3c hard substance. Agricola speaks of " aes" as synonymous with "cuprum," %0a%3c and Pliny will be found several times in the present Book, speaking of %0a%3c "aes Cyprium," meaning probably the finest kind of copper, and that with- %0a%3c out alloy. — B. %0a%3c %0a%3c 4 Pliny has already referred to this topic in B. ii. c. 63.— B. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 2.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c GOLD. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 69 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c signs could be any other than expressions of the indignation %0a%3c felt by our sacred parent ! We penetrate into her entrails, and %0a%3c seek for treasures in the abodes even of the Manes, 4 * as though %0a%3c each spot we tread upon were not sufficiently bounteous and %0a%3c fertile for us ! %0a%3c %0a%3c And yet, amid all this, we are far from making remedies the %0a%3c object of our researches : and how few in thus delving into the %0a%3c earth have in view the promotion of medicinal knowledge ! For %0a%3c it is upon her surface, in fact, that she has presented us with %0a%3c these substances, equally with the cereals, bounteous and ever %0a%3c ready, as she is, in supplying us with all things for our benefit ! %0a%3c It is what is concealed from our view, what is sunk far be- %0a%3c neath her surface, objects, in fact, of no rapid formation, 6 that %0a%3c urge us to our ruin, that send us to tbe very depths of hell. %0a%3c As the mind ranges in vague speculation, let us only consider, %0a%3c proceeding through all ages, as these operations are, when will %0a%3c be the end of thus exhausting the earth, and to what point %0a%3c will avarice finally penetrate !

GOLD. %0a%3c %0a%3c Gold is dug out of the earth, and, in close proximity to it, %0a%3c chrysocolla, 6 a substance which, that it may appear all the %0a%3c more precious, still retains the name 7 which it has borrowed %0a%3c from gold. 8 It was not enough for us to have discovered one %0a%3c bane for the human race, but we must set a value too upon the %0a%3c very humours of gold. 9 While avarice, too, was on the search %0a%3c %0a%3c *" Or shades below. 5 " Ilia quae non nascuntur repente." %0a%3c %0a%3c s •' Chrysocolla" is fully described in Chapter 26 of this Book. — B. %0a%3c " Meaning "gold glue," or "gold solder." %0a%3c %0a%3c 8 There is considerable variation in the text of this passage, as found in %0a%3c the different editions. In that of Dalechamps, the Variorum, and those of %0a%3c De Lae't and Sillig, the sentence concludes with the words " nomen ex auro %0a%3c custodiens;" while in those of Valpy, Lemaire, Poinsinet, Ajasson, and %0a%3c others, we find substituted for them the words, "Non natura," " Nomen %0a%3c natnra," " Nomine natura," or "Nomen naturam." — B. The first reading %0a%3c is warranted by the Bamberg MS. %0a%3c %0a%3c » " Auri sanies." More properly speaking, " the corrupt matter dis- %0a%3c charged by gold."

In addition %0a%3c to the standard value of these metals, the art of painting lends %0a%3c its aid, and we have rendered gold and silver still more costly %0a%3c by the art of chasing them. Man has learned how to challenge %0a%3c both Nature and art to become the incitements to vice ! His %0a%3c very cups he has delighted to engrave with libidinous subjects, %0a%3c and" he takes pleasure in drinking from vessels of obscene form ! 1J %0a%3c But in lapse of time, the metals passed out of fashion, and %0a%3c men began to make no account of them ; gold and silver, in %0a%3c fact, became too common. From this same earth we have ex- %0a%3c tracted vessels of murrhine 13 and vases of crystal, 13 * objects %0a%3c the very fragility of which is considered to enhance their value. %0a%3c In fact, it has come to be looked upon as a proof of opulence, %0a%3c and as quite the glory of luxury, to possess that which may be %0a%3c irremediably destroyed in an instant.

WHAT "WAS THR F1KST RECOMMENDATION OF GOLD. %0a%3c %0a%3c "Would that gold could have been banished for ever from %0a%3c the earth, accursed by universal report, 17 as some of the most %0a%3c celebrated writers have expressed themselves, reviled by the %0a%3c reproaches of the best of men, and looked upon as discovered %0a%3c only for the ruin of mankind. How much more happy the %0a%3c age when things themselves were bartered for one another ; as %0a%3c was the case in the times of the Trojan war, if we are to be- %0a%3c lieve what Homer says. For, in this way, in my opinion, was %0a%3c commerce then carried on for the supply of the necessaries of %0a%3c life. Some, he tells us, would make their purchases by bartering %0a%3c ox-hides, and others by bartering iron or the spoil which they %0a%3c had taken from the enemy : 18 and yet he himself, already an %0a%3c admirer of gold, was so far aware of the relative value of tilings, %0a%3c that Glaucus, he informs us, exchanged his arms of gold, valued %0a%3c at one hundred oxen, for those of Diomedes, which were worth %0a%3c but nine. 19 Proceeding upon the same system of barter, many %0a%3c of the fines imposed by ancient laws, at Rome even, were %0a%3c levied in cattle, 20 [and not in money]. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 4. THE OBIGIN OF GOLD KINGS. %0a%3c %0a%3c The worst crime against mankind was committed by him %0a%3c who was the first to put a ring upon his fingers: and yet we %0a%3c are not informed, by tradition, who it was that first did so. For %0a%3c as to all the stories told about Prometheus, I look upon them as %0a%3c utterly fabulous, although I am aware that the ancients used %0a%3c to represent him with a ring of iron : it was their intention, %0a%3c however, to signify a chain thereby, and not an ornament. %0a%3c As to the ring of Midas, 21 which, upon the collet being turned %0a%3c %0a%3c 17 " Sacrum famae." This is the reading given by the Bamberg MS. %0a%3c in substitution for " aurum, sacra fames" and other readings of a similar %0a%3c nature, in which Pliny was thought by the commentators to allude to the %0a%3c famous lines of Virgil — %0a%3c %0a%3c " Quid non mortalia pectora cogis, %0a%3c Auri sacra fames !" %0a%3c Had he alluded to the passage of Virgil, it is not probable that he would %0a%3c have used the expression in the plural, " celeberrinii auctores." %0a%3c %0a%3c 18 II.

It was the hand, aud a sinister 22 hand, too, in %0a%3c every sense, that first brought gold into such high repute : not %0a%3c a Roman hand, however, for upon that it was the practice to %0a%3c wear a ring of iron only, and solely as an indication of war- %0a%3c like prowess. %0a%3c %0a%3c As to the usage followed by the Koman kings, it is not easy %0a%3c to pronounce an opinion : the statue of Romulus in the Capitol %0a%3c wears no ring, nor does any other statue — not that of L. Brutus %0a%3c even — with the sole exception of those of Nuina and Servius %0a%3c Tullius. I am surprised at this absence of the ring, in the %0a%3c case of the Tarquinii more particularly, seeing that they were %0a%3c originally from Greece, 22 * a country from which the use of %0a%3c gold rings was first introduced ; though even at the present %0a%3c day the people of Lacedaemon are in the habit of wearing rings %0a%3c made of iron. Tarquinius Priscus, however, it is well known, %0a%3c was the first who presented his son with the golden bulla, 23 on %0a%3c the occasion of his slaying an enemy before he had laid aside the %0a%3c praetexta ; 24 from which period the custom of wearing the bulla %0a%3c has been continued, a distinction confined to the children of %0a%3c those who have served in the cavalry, those of other persons %0a%3c simply wearing a leather thong. 25 Such being the case, I am %0a%3c the more surprised that the statue of this Tarquinius should %0a%3c be without a ring. %0a%3c %0a%3c And yet, with reference to the very name of the ring, I find %0a%3c that there has been considerable uncertainty. That given to %0a%3c %0a%3c 22 " Sinistra." The play here upon the word "sinister" cannot he so %0a%3c well transferred into the English language ; but it hears reference to the %0a%3c double meaning of the word, " on the left hand," and " unlucky," " i II— %0a%3c omened," or, as we say " sinister."

Nor was it the practice for %0a%3c any person to wear these rings, except those who for this reason %0a%3c had received them at the public expense ; and in most in- %0a%3c stances, it was without this distinction that the Roman generals %0a%3c celebrated their public triumphs. 29 For whereas an Etruscan %0a%3c crown 30 of gold was supported from behind over the head of %0a%3c the victor, he himself, equally with the slave probably, who %0a%3c was so supporting the crown, had nothing but a ring of %0a%3c iron upon his finger. 31 It was in this manner that C. Marius %0a%3c celebrated his triumph over Jugurtha ; and he never as- %0a%3c sumed 32 the golden ring, it is said, until the period of his %0a%3c third consulship. 33 Those, too, who had received golden rings %0a%3c on the occasion of an embassy, only wore them when in public, %0a%3c resuming the ring of iron when in their houses. It is in pur- %0a%3c suance of this custom that even at the present day, an iron %0a%3c ring 34 is sent by way of present to a woman when betrothed, %0a%3c and that, too, without any stone in it. %0a%3c %0a%3c For my own part, I do not find that any rings were used in %0a%3c the days of the Trojan "War; at all events, Homer nowhere %0a%3c %0a%3c 26 AaKTvXtov, from SuktvXoq, a "finger." %0a%3c %0a%3c 27 Festus says that this was the Oscan name for a ring. It would %0a%3c appear to be allied to the word " unguis," which means a nail of the %0a%3c finger or toe, and would perhaps signify a " nail ornament." %0a%3c %0a%3c 28 As meaning a seal or signet, lor which purpose, as we shall find ex* %0a%3c plained in the sequel, the ring was used. %0a%3c %0a%3c i9 This seems to be the meaning of " Vulgoque sic triumph abant." %0a%3c %0a%3c 30 As to these crowns, see 15. xxi. c. 4. %0a%3c %0a%3c 31 As to some other particulars connected with this usage, see the end %0a%3c of B. xxviii. c. 7. %0a%3c %0a%3c 32 And yet, as Hardouin remarks, before his time, when Scipio was %0a%3c besieging Carthage, the bodies of the Eoman tribunes, when selected for %0a%3c burial by Ilasdrubal, were distinguished by their rings of gold.

He does %0a%3c not inform us too, that when the chiefs drew lots to ascertain %0a%3c which one of them should reply to the challenge 38 of the %0a%3c enemj'-, they made any use of rings 39 for the purpose ; and when %0a%3c he enumerates the articles that were manufactured at the %0a%3c forge 40 of the gods, he speaks of this as being the origin 41 of %0a%3c fibulae 42 and other articles of female ornament, such as ear- %0a%3c rings for example, but does not make any mention of rings. %0a%3c %0a%3c 43 Whoever it was that first introduced the use of rings, he %0a%3c did so not without hesitation ; for he placed this ornament on %0a%3c the left hand, the hand which is generally concealed, 44 whereas, %0a%3c if he had been sure of its being an honourable distinction, it %0a%3c would have been made more conspicuous upon the right. And if %0a%3c any one should raise the objection that this would have acted %0a%3c as an impediment to the right hand, I can only say that the %0a%3c usage in more recent times fortifies my opinion, and that the %0a%3c inconvenience of wearing rings on the left hand would have %0a%3c been still greater, seeing that it is with the left hand that the %0a%3c %0a%3c 3i " Codicillos."

B. vii. c. 13), for wearing the ring %0a%3c on the left hand. It was so worn, he says, from an apprehension that %0a%3c the precious stone with which it was set, might receive injury from the %0a%3c continual use made of the right hand. %0a%3c %0a%3c 44 Under the folds of the toga. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 5.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c GOLD POSSESSED BY THE ANCIENTS. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 75 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c shield is held.

THE QUANTITY OF GOLD POSSESSED BY THE ANCIENTS. %0a%3c %0a%3c At Rome, for a long period of time, the quantity of gold %0a%3c was but very small. At all events, after the capture of the %0a%3c City by the Gauls, when peace was about to be purchased, not %0a%3c more than one thousand pounds' weight of gold could be col- %0a%3c lected. I am by no means unaware of the fact that in the %0a%3c third 46 consulship of Pompeius there was lost from the throne %0a%3c of Jupiter Capitolinus two thousand pounds' weight of gold, %0a%3c originally placed there by Camillus ; a circumstance which has %0a%3c led most persons to suppose, that two thousand pounds' weight %0a%3c was the quantity then collected. But in reality, this excess %0a%3c of one thousand pounds was contributed from the spoil taken %0a%3c from the Gauls, amplified as it was by the gold of which they %0a%3c had stripped the temples, in that part of the City which they %0a%3c had captured. %0a%3c %0a%3c The story of Torquatus, 47 too, is a proof that the Gauls were %0a%3c in the habit of wearing ornaments of gold when engaged in %0a%3c combat ; 48 from which it would appear that the sum taken %0a%3c from the Gauls themselves, and the amount of which they had %0a%3c pillaged the temples, were only equal to the amount of gold %0a%3c collected for the ransom, and no more ; and this is what was %0a%3c really meant by the response given by the augurs, that Jupiter %0a%3c Capitolinus had rendered again the ransom twofold. 49 As we %0a%3c %0a%3c 45 II. B. xvii. 1. 52. %0a%3c %0a%3c 46 The reading in most MSS. is the "fourth consulship." This, how- %0a%3c ever, is an error which has been rectified by the Bamberg and some other %0a%3c MSS.

The meaning of this passage is obscure, and cannot with %0a%3c certainty be ascertained. Holland renders it, " To the light and know- %0a%3c ledge whereof we come by means of revelation from Augurie, which gave %0a%3c us to understand, that Jupiter Capitolinus had rendered again the foresaid %0a%3c Biimme in duple proportion." Littre gives a similar translation. Ajasson %0a%3c translates it, " This, at least, is what we may presume, from the fact of %0a%3c there being discovered double the amount expected ;" following the ex- %0a%3c planation given by Hardouin. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 76 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c plint's natural history. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XXXIII. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c were just now speaking on the subject of rings, it may be as %0a%3c well to add, by way of passing remark, that upon the officer w %0a%3c in charge of the Temple of Jupiter Capitolinus being arrested, %0a%3c he broke the stone of his ring between his teeth, 81 and expired %0a%3c upon the spot, thus putting an end to all possibility of dis- %0a%3c covering the perpetrator of the theft. %0a%3c %0a%3c It appears, therefore, that in the year of the City 364, when %0a%3c Rome was captured by the Gauls, there was but two thousand %0a%3c pounds' weight of gold, at the very most ; and this, too, at a %0a%3c period when, according to the returns of the census, there were %0a%3c already one hundred and fifty-two thousand five hundred and %0a%3c seventy-three free citizens in it. In this same city, too, three %0a%3c hundred and seven years later, the gold which C. Marius the %0a%3c younger 53 conveyed to Praeneste from the Temple of the Capitol %0a%3c when in flames, and all the other shrines, amounted to thirteen %0a%3c thousand pounds' weight, such being the sum that figured in the %0a%3c inscriptions at the triumph of Sylla ; on which occasion it was %0a%3c displayed in the procession, as well as six thousand pounds' %0a%3c weight of silver. The same Sylla had, the day before, dis- %0a%3c played in his triumph fifteen thousand pounds' weight of gold, %0a%3c and one hundred and fifteen thousand pounds' weight of silver, %0a%3c the fruit of all his other victories. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 6. THE BIGHT OF WEARING GOLD RINGS. %0a%3c %0a%3c It does not appear that rings were in common use before the %0a%3c time of Cneius Flavius, the son of Annius. This Flavius was %0a%3c the first to publish a table 63 of the days for pleading, 64 which %0a%3c till then the populace had to ascertain each day from a few %0a%3c %0a%3c 50 The " aedituus," or " temple keeper."

After his defeat by Sylla at Sacriportus, he re- %0a%3c tired into the fortified town of Praeneste, where he had deposited the %0a%3c treasures of the Capitoline temple. The temple, after this conflagration, %0a%3c was rebuilt by order of Sylla. %0a%3c %0a%3c 83 Called the " Fasti ;" probably because this was the first word of the %0a%3c title. %0a%3c %0a%3c 54 "Dies fasti." These were the days on which the courts sat, and the %0a%3c Praetor, who was the chief judge, gave his decisions. The word " fasti" %0a%3c is derived from the ancient Latin " for," or from the old Greek word Adw, %0a%3c both signifying "to speak:" consequently the " dies fasti " were "the %0a%3c speaking days," and the " dies nefasti " the "non-speaking days " in %0a%3c allusion to the restrictions put upon the judgments of the Praetor ' %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 6.] TIIE HI GUT OF WEARING GOLD KINGS. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 77 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c great personages. 66 The son of a freedman only, and secretary %0a%3c to Appius Caecus, 67 (at whose request, by dint of natural shrewd- %0a%3c ness and continual observation, he had selected these days and %0a%3c made them public), 58 he obtained such high favour with the %0a%3c people, that he was created curule aedile; in conjunction with %0a%3c Quintus Anicius Praenestinus, who a few years before had been %0a%3c an enemy to Home, 69 and to the exclusion of C. Pcetilius and %0a%3c Domitius, whose fathers respectively were of consular rank. 60 %0a%3c The additional honour was also conferred on Flavius, of making %0a%3c him tribune of the people at the same time, a thing which oc- %0a%3c casioned such a degree of indignation, that, as we find stated in %0a%3c the more ancient Annals, " the rings 61 were laid aside !" %0a%3c %0a%3c Most persons, however, are mistaken in the supposition that %0a%3c on this occasion the members of the equestrian order did the %0a%3c same : for it is in consequence of these additional words, " the %0a%3c phalerae, 62 too, were laid aside as well," that the name of the %0a%3c equestrian order was added. These rings, too, as the Annuls %0a%3c tell us, were laid aside by the nobility, and not 63 by the whole %0a%3c body of the senate. This event took place in the consulship %0a%3c of P. Sempronius and P. Sulpicius. 64 Flavius made a vow %0a%3c that he would consecrate a temple to Concord, if he should %0a%3c succeed in reconciling the privileged orders with the plebeians : %0a%3c and as no part of the public funds could be voted for the pur- %0a%3c pose, he accordingly built a small shrine of brass 65 in the Grae- %0a%3c %0a%3c 68 This complex state of the Roman Calendar long remained one of the %0a%3c sources from which the priesthood and the patrician order derived their %0a%3c power and influence over the plebeians. Having no other method of as- %0a%3c certaining what days were "fasti," and what were " nefasti," the lower %0a%3c classes were obliged either to apply to the priests and nobles for inform- %0a%3c ation, or to await the proclamation by the priests of the various festivals %0a%3c about to take place. %0a%3c %0a%3c 67 Appius Claudius Caecus, the Censor and jurisconsult, who constructed %0a%3c the Appian Way. 58 a.u.c. 440, or B.C. 314. %0a%3c %0a%3c 49 In the war, probably, with the twelve nations of Etruria, who were %0a%3c conquered by the Consul Fabius a.u.c. 444.

Then again, in the %0a%3c case of other gems, luxury has deemed it no less than sacrilege %0a%3c to make a mark 77 even upon them, and has caused them to be set %0a%3c whole, that no one may suppose that the ring was ever intended %0a%3c to be employed as a signet. In other instances, luxury has %0a%3c willed that certain stones, on the side even that is concealed by %0a%3c the finger, should not 78 be closed in with gold, thus making %0a%3c gold of less account than thousands of tiny pebbles. On the %0a%3c other hand again, many persons will admit of no gems being %0a%3c set in their rings, but impress their seal with the gold 79 itself, %0a%3c an invention which dates from the reign of Claudius Caesar. %0a%3c At the present day, too, the very slaves even, incase their iron %0a%3c rings with gold (while other articles belonging to them, they %0a%3c decorate with pure gold), 80 a licence which first originated in %0a%3c the Isle of Samothrace, 81 as the name given to the invention %0a%3c clearly shows. %0a%3c %0a%3c 74 This is an erroneous assertion, both as to the East, and as to Egypt. %0a%3c See instances to the contrary in Genesis, c. xli. v. 42 ; and in Esther, c. iii. %0a%3c verses 10, 12, and c. viii. verses 2, 8, 10. %0a%3c %0a%3c 75 " Literis contenta solis." %0a%3c %0a%3c 74 The Thirty-seventh Hook.

How many hands are worn down that one little joint %0a%3c may be ornamented !" Martial, Epigr. B. v. Ep. 11, speaks of his friend %0a%3c Stella as wearing on the joint of one finger sardonyxes, emeralds, and %0a%3c jaspers. 77 " Violari." See B. xxxvii. c. 1. %0a%3c %0a%3c 13 A fashion much followed at the present day. %0a%3c %0a%3c 19 This also is a not uncommon fashion at the present day. %0a%3c %0a%3c 80 From the "Trinummus" of Plautus, A. iv. s. 4, we learn that the ring %0a%3c worn by slaves was called " condalium." From the " Truculentus" of Plau- %0a%3c tus we learn also that these rings were sometimes made of bronze. The %0a%3c "jus nnuli," or right of wearing a gold ring, was never conceded to slaves. %0a%3c %0a%3c 81 See B. iv. c. 23. In the Origines of Isidorus Hispalensis, B. xix. c. %0a%3c 32, we find mention made of " A Samothracian gold ring, with an iron %0a%3c bezil, so called from the place of its invention." Pliny has already made %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c SO %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c PLINY'S NAitTKAL HISTORY. [Boik XXXITT. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c It was the custom at first to wear rings on a single finger'' 2 %0a%3c only, the one, namely, that is next to the little finger ; and this %0a%3c we see the case in the statues of Jfuma and Servius Tullius %0a%3c In later times, it became the practice to put rings on the finger %0a%3c next to the thumb, even in the case of the statues of the gods ; %0a%3c and more recently, again, it has been the fashion to wear them %0a%3c upon the little finger 83 as well. Among the peoples of Gallia %0a%3c and Britannia, the middle finger, it is said, is used for this pur- %0a%3c pose. At the present day, however, among us, this is the only %0a%3c ringer that is excepted, all the others being loaded with rings, %0a%3c smaller rings even being separately adapted for the smaller %0a%3c joints of the fingers. Some there are who heap several rings %0a%3c upon the little finger alone ; while others, again, wear but one %0a%3c ring upon this finger, the ring that sets a seal upon the signet- %0a%3c ring itself, this last being kept carefully shut up as an object %0a%3c of rarity, too precious to be worn in common use, and only to %0a%3c be taken from the cabinet 31 as from a sanctuary. And thus is %0a%3c the wearing of a single ring upon the little finger no more %0a%3c than an ostentatious advertisement that the owner has property %0a%3c of a more precious nature under seal at home ! %0a%3c %0a%3c Some, too, make a parade of the weight of their rings, while %0a%3c to others it is quite a labour 84 to wear more than one at a time: %0a%3c some, in their solicitude for the safety of their gems, make the %0a%3c hoop of gold tinsel, and fill it with a lighter material than gold, %0a%3c thinking thereby to diminish the risks of a fall. 86 Others, again, %0a%3c fre in the habit of inclosing poisons beneath the stones of %0a%3c heir rings, and so wear them as instruments of death ; De- %0a%3c mosthenes, for instance, that greatest of the orators of Greece. 87 %0a%3c And then, besides, how many of the crimes that are stimulated %0a%3c by cupidity, are committed through the instrumentality of %0a%3c allusion to the luxurious habits of the slaves, in B. xiii. c. 4 ■ and B. %0a%3c xviii. c. 2 ; a subject upon which Juvenal enlarges in his Third Satire. %0a%3c %0a%3c 82 The reasons are mentioned by Ateius Capito, as quoted by Macrobius, %0a%3c Saturnal. B. vii. c. 13 : also by Apion the Grammarian, as quoted by %0a%3c Aulus Gellius, B. x. c. 10. %0a%3c %0a%3c K3 The ring of each finger had its own appropriate name. %0a%3c %0a%3c 84 The " dactyliotheca," or "ring-box." %0a%3c %0a%3c 85 Juvenal, Sat. i. 1. 26, et. seq., speaks of the summer rin°-s of the %0a%3c Roman fops, and their fingers sweating beneath the weight. ° %0a%3c %0a%3c 86 Martial, Epigr. B. xiv., speaks of the numerous accidents to which a %0a%3c weighty ring was liable. %0a%3c %0a%3c « Hannibal, too, for instance, as mentioned in Note 51 to the preceding %0a%3c %0a%3c UfiftptCTa %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 6.J %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c THE EIGHT OF WEARING GOLD RINGS. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 81 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c rings ! 88 How happy the times, how truly innocent, in which %0a%3c no seal was ever put to anything ! At the present day, on the %0a%3c contrary, our very food even and our drink have to be preserved %0a%3c from theft 89 through the agency of the ring : a result owing to %0a%3c those legions of slaves, those throngs of foreigners which are %0a%3c introduced into our houses, multitudes so numerous that we %0a%3c require the services of a nomenclator 90 even, to tell us the %0a%3c names of our own servants. Very different was it in the times %0a%3c of our forefathers, when each person possessed a single servant %0a%3c only, one of his master's own lineage, called Marcipor or %0a%3c Lucipor, 91 from his master's name, as the case might be, and %0a%3c taking all his meals with him in common ; when, too, there %0a%3c was no occasion for taking precautions at home by keeping a %0a%3c watch upon the domestics. But at the present day, we not %0a%3c only procure dainties which are sure to be pilfered, but hands %0a%3c to pilfer them as well ; and so far is it from being sufficient to %0a%3c have the very keys sealed, that the signet-ring is often taken %0a%3c from off the owner's finger while he is overpowered with sleep %0a%3c or lying on his death-bed. 93 %0a%3c %0a%3c Indeed the most important transactions of life are now made %0a%3c to depend upon this instrument, though at what period this first %0a%3c began to be the case, I am at a loss to say. It would appear, %0a%3c however, so far as foreign nations are concerned, that we may %0a%3c admit the importance attached to it, from the days of Poly- %0a%3c crates, 93 the tyrant of Samos, whose favourite ring, after being %0a%3c %0a%3c 88 He alludes, probably, to forgeries perpetrated through the agency of %0a%3c false signets. %0a%3c %0a%3c *>'■> Hautus, Cicero, Horace, and Martial, each in his own age, bears %0a%3c testimony to the truth of this statement. %0a%3c %0a%3c 90 Or remembrancer ; a slave whose duty it was to remind his master of %0a%3c the name of each member of his household ; see B. xxix. c. 8. Athenaeus, %0a%3c B. vi., speaks of as many as twenty thousand slaves belonging to one %0a%3c household. Demetrius, the freedman of Pompey, mentioned in B. xxxv. %0a%3c c. 58, had a retinue of slaves equal to an army in amount. %0a%3c %0a%3c 91 Meaning "Marci puer," or "Luci puer" — "Marcius' boy," or %0a%3c " Lucius' boy." %0a%3c %0a%3c 92 Suetonius says, c. 73, that Tiberius, in his last illness, awoke after a %0a%3c long lethargy, and demanded his signet-ring, which his son-in-law, Cali- %0a%3c gula, had removed from his finger, under the supposition that he was %0a%3c dead. Macro, to avoid any unpleasant results in the way of punishment, %0a%3c caused the emperor to be smothered with the pillows and bedclothes. %0a%3c %0a%3c 93 This famous and somewhat improbable story of the ring of Polycrates %0a%3c is told by Valerius Maximus, B. vi. c. 9 ; Herodotus, B. iii. ; and Cicero, %0a%3c De Finibus, B. iv. Pliny again mentions it in B. xxxvii. cc. 2, 4. %0a%3c %0a%3c VOL. VI. G %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 82 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c plint's NATURAL DISTORT.

The use of the ring must, of necessity, %0a%3c have become greatly extended with the increase of usury ; %0a%3c one proof of which is, the usage still prevalent among the %0a%3c lower classes, of whipping off the ring 95 the moment a simple %0a%3c contract is made ; a practice which takes its date, no doubt, %0a%3c from a period when there was no more expeditious method of %0a%3c giving an earnest on closing a bargain. We may therefore %0a%3c very safely conclude, that though money was first introduced %0a%3c among us, the use of rings was introduced very shortly after. %0a%3c Of money, I shall shortly have occasion to speak further. 96 %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 7. THE DECFJRIES OP THE JUDGES. %0a%3c %0a%3c Rings, as soon as they began to be commonly worn, distin- %0a%3c guished the second order from the plebeians, in the same %0a%3c manner as the use of the tunic 97 distinguished the senate hem %0a%3c those who only wore the ring. Still, however, this last dis- %0a%3c tinction was introduced at a later period only, and we find it %0a%3c stated by writers that the public heralds 98 even were formerly %0a%3c in the habit of wearing the tunic with the purple laticlave ; %0a%3c the father of Lucius JElius Stilo," for instance, from whom %0a%3c his son received the cognomen of " Prajconinus," in conse- %0a%3c quence of his father's occupation as a herald. But the use of %0a%3c rings, no doubt, was the distinguishing mark of a third and %0a%3c intermediate brder, between the plebeians and the senators ; %0a%3c and the title of " eques," originally derived from the posses- %0a%3c sion of a war-horse, 1 is given at the present day as an indica- %0a%3c tion of a certain amount of income. This, however, is of %0a%3c comparatively recent introduction; for when the late Emperor %0a%3c Augustus made his regulations for the decuries, 2 the greater %0a%3c part of the members thereof were persons who wore iron rings, %0a%3c and these bore the name, not of "equites," but of "judices," %0a%3c %0a%3c 94 He was crucified by Oroetes, the Persian satrap of Sardis. %0a%3c %0a%3c 95 " Anulo exsiliente." so i n Chapter 13 of this Book. %0a%3c 97 The laticlave tunic.

These decuries, too, were themselves distinguished by %0a%3c several denominations — " tribunes 5 of the treasury," "selecti," 6 %0a%3c and "judices :" in addition to whom, there were the persons %0a%3c styled the " nine hundred," 7 chosen from all the decuries for %0a%3c the purpose of keeping the voting- boxes at the comitia. From %0a%3c the ambitious adoption, however, of some one of these names, %0a%3c great divisions ensued in this order, one person styling himself %0a%3c a member of the nine hundred, another one of the selecti, and %0a%3c a third a tribune of the treasury. %0a%3c %0a%3c CUAP. 8. PARTICULARS CONNECTED WITH THE EQUESTRIAN ORDER. %0a%3c %0a%3c At length, however, in the ninth 8 year of the reign of the %0a%3c Emperor Tiberius, the equestrian order was united in a single %0a%3c body ; and a decree was passed, establishing to whom belonged %0a%3c the right of wearing the ring, in the consulship of C. Asinius %0a%3c Pollio andC. Antistius Vetus, the year from the foundation of the %0a%3c City, 775. It is a matter for surprise, how almost futile, Ave %0a%3c may say, was the cause which led to this change. C. Sulpicius %0a%3c Galba, 9 desirous in his youth to establish his credit with the %0a%3c Emperor by hunting 10 out grounds for prosecuting 11 the keepers %0a%3c %0a%3c s "Turmffl." Squadrons of thirty " equites" or horsemen; ten of %0a%3c which squadrons were attached to each legion. %0a%3c %0a%3c 4 Before the time of Augustus, there were but three decuries. %0a%3c %0a%3c 8 A law introduced by Aurelius Cotta, b.c. 70, enacted that the Ju- %0a%3c dicrs should be chosen from the three classes — of Senators, Equites, and %0a%3c Tribuni aerarii, or Tribunes of the treasury, these last being taken from %0a%3c the body of the people, and being persons possessed of some property. %0a%3c %0a%3c 6 Members selected by lot. 7 " Nongenti." %0a%3c %0a%3c 8 Tacitus says that this took place the year before, iu the consulship of %0a%3c C.

See the Annales, B. iii. c. 86. %0a%3c %0a%3c 9 Brother of the Emperor Galba. 10 "Aucupatus." %0a%3c %0a%3c 11 Suetonius says that Tiberius instructed the sediles to prohibit stews %0a%3c and eating-houses : from which we may conclude, Hardouin says, that C. %0a%3c Sulpicius Galba was an eedile. * %0a%3c %0a%3c G 2 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 84 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c pliny's natubal histobt. [Book XXXIII. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c of victualling-houses, made complaint in the senate that the %0a%3c proprietors of those places were in the habit of protecting %0a%3c themselves from the consequences of their guilt by their plea %0a%3c of wearing the golden ring. 12 For this reason, an ordinance %0a%3c was made that no person whatsoever should have this right of %0a%3c wearing the ring, unless, freeborn himself as regarded his %0a%3c father and paternal grandfather, he should be assessed by the %0a%3c censors at four hundred thousand sesterces, and entitled, under %0a%3c the Julian Law, 13 to sit in the fourteen tiers of seats at the %0a%3c theatre. In later times, however, people began to apply in %0a%3c whole crowds for this mark of rank ; aud in consequence of %0a%3c the diversities of opinion which were occasioned thereby, the %0a%3c Emperor Caius 14 added a fifth decury to the number. Indeed %0a%3c to such a pitch has conceit now arisen, that whereas, under the %0a%3c late Emperor Augustus, the decuries could not be completed, %0a%3c at the present day they will not suffice to receive all the mem- %0a%3c bers of the equestrian order, and we see in every quarter per- %0a%3c sons even who have been but just liberated from slavery, making %0a%3c a leap all at once to the distinction of the golden ring : a thing %0a%3c that never used to happen in former days, as it was by the %0a%3c ling of iron that the equites and the judices were then to be %0a%3c recognized. %0a%3c %0a%3c Indeed, so promiscuously was this privilege at last conferred, %0a%3c that Flavius Proculus, one of the equites, informed against %0a%3c four hundred persons on this ground, before the Emperor Clau- %0a%3c dius, who was then censor : 15 and thus we see, an order, which %0a%3c was established as a mark of distinction from other private in- %0a%3c dividuals of free birth, has been shared in common with slaves ! %0a%3c %0a%3c The Gracchi were the first to attach to this order the separate %0a%3c appellation of "judices," their object being at the same moment %0a%3c a seditious popularity and the humiliation of the senate. After %0a%3c the fall of these men, in consequence of the varying results of %0a%3c seditious movements, the name and influence of the equestrian %0a%3c order were lost, and became merged in those of the publicani,i« %0a%3c %0a%3c 12 Or, in other words, belonging to the equestrian order. The Roman %0a%3c equites often followed the pursuits of bankers, and farmers of the public %0a%3c revenues. %0a%3c %0a%3c 13 A law passed in the time of Julius Caesar, b c. 69, which permitted %0a%3c Eoman equites, in case they or their parents had ever had a Census %0a%3c equestris, to sit in the fourteen rows fixed by the Lex Roscia Theatralis. %0a%3c %0a%3c 14 Caligula. 15 Conjointly with L.

At last, however, Marcus Cicero, during %0a%3c his consulship, and at the period of the Catilinarian troubles, %0a%3c re-established the equestrian name, it being his vaunt that he %0a%3c himself had sprung from that order, and he, by certain acts of %0a%3c popularity peculiar to himself, having conciliated its support. %0a%3c Since that period, it is very clear that the equites have formed %0a%3c the third body in the state, and the name of the equestrian order %0a%3c has been added to the formula — "The Senate and People of %0a%3c Rome." Henqe 17 it is, too, that at the present day even, the %0a%3c name of this order is written after that of the people, it being %0a%3c the one that was the last instituted. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 9. — HOW OFTEN THE NAME OE THE EQTJESTEIAN OBDEE %0a%3c HAS BEEN CHANGED. %0a%3c %0a%3c Indeed, the name itself of the equites even, has been fre- %0a%3c quently changed, and that too, in the case of those who only %0a%3c owed their name to the fact of their service on horseback. %0a%3c Under Romulus and the other kings, the equites were known %0a%3c as " Celeres," 18 then again as " Flexuntes," 19 and after that %0a%3c as " Trossuli," 20 from the fact of their having taken a certain %0a%3c town of Etruria, situate nine miles on this side of Yolsinii, %0a%3c without any assistance from the infantry ; a name too which %0a%3c survived till after the death of C. Gracchus. %0a%3c %0a%3c In reality, they were mostly members of the equestrian order, and the %0a%3c words "equites" and " publicani" are often used as synonymous. %0a%3c %0a%3c 17 " This passage seems to be the addition of some ignorant copyist. It %0a%3c is indeed a remarkable fact, that we have no inscription in which we see %0a%3c the Equites named after the people as well as the Senate." — Laboulaye, %0a%3c Essai sur Us his Criminelles des Eomains ; Paris, 1845, p. 224. %0a%3c %0a%3c 18 According to Livy, B. i. c. 15, the Celeres were three hundred Roman %0a%3c knights whom Romulus established as a body-guard. Their name, pro- %0a%3c bably, was derived from the Greek KfA»jc, a "war-horse," or "charger," %0a%3c and the body consisted, no doubt, of the patricians in general, or such of %0a%3c them as could keep horses. Another origin assigned to the appellation is %0a%3c 11 Celer," the name of a chieftain, who was a favourite of Romulus. The %0a%3c adjective "celer," ** swift," owes its origin, probably, to the title of these %0a%3c horsemen. %0a%3c %0a%3c 19 A title derived, possibly, as Delafosse suggests, " a flectendis habenis," %0a%3c from " managing the reins." %0a%3c %0a%3c 20 Called " Trossum " or " Trossulum," it is supposed. The remains %0a%3c of a town are still to be seen at Trosso, two miles from Montefiascone in %0a%3c Tuscany. The Greek word rpwKaWlg, a " cricket," and the Latin " to- %0a%3c rosulus," " muscular," have been suggested as the origm of this name. %0a%3c Ajasson suggests the Latin verb " truso," to " push on," as its origin. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 86 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c pliny's NATURAL HISTORY.

Posthumius was the first who conferred one : %0a%3c on taking the camp of the Latins at Lake Pegillus, 29 he gave %0a%3c a crown of gold, made from the spoil, to the soldier whose %0a%3c valour had mainly contributed to this success.

Yes, so it is, by Hercules ! and yet you, the %0a%3c same Brutus, have not said a word about women wearing gold %0a%3c upon their feet ; while we, on the other hand, charge him with %0a%3c criminality 34 who was the first to confer dignity upon gold by %0a%3c wearing the ring. Let men even, at the present day, wear gold %0a%3c upon the arms in form of bracelets — known as " dardania," %0a%3c because the practice first originated in Dardania, and called %0a%3c "viriolse" in the language of the Celts, " viria?" 33 in that of %0a%3c Celtiberia, let women wear gold upon their arms 36 and %0a%3c all their fingers, their necks, their ears, the tresses of their %0a%3c hair ; let chains of gold run meandering along their sides ; %0a%3c and in the still hours of the night let sachets filled with pearls %0a%3c hang suspended from the necks of their mistresses, all bedizened %0a%3c with gold, so that in their very sleep even they may still %0a%3c retain the consciousness that they are the possessors of such %0a%3c %0a%3c 30 a.u.c. 479, and b.c. 275.

The " as" of cop- %0a%3c per weighed exactly one libra ; and hence it is that we still use %0a%3c the terms "libella" 47 and " dupondius." 48 Hence it is, too, that %0a%3c fines and penalties are inflicted under the name of "ass grave," 49 %0a%3c and that the words still used in keeping accounts are " ex- %0a%3c pensa," 50 " impendia," 51 and " dependere." 62 Hence, too, the %0a%3c word " stipendium," meaning the pay of the soldiers, which is %0a%3c nothing more than " stipis pondera ;" 53 and from the same source %0a%3c those other words, " dispensatores" 54 and " libripendes." 55 It is %0a%3c also from this circumstance that in sales of slaves, at the present %0a%3c day even, the formality of using the balance is introduced. %0a%3c %0a%3c King Servius was the first to make an impress upon copper. %0a%3c Before his time, according to Timseus, at Rome the raw metal %0a%3c only was used. The form of a sheep was the first figure im- %0a%3c pressed upon money, and to this fact it owes its name, %0a%3c " pecunia." 66 The highest figure at which one man's property %0a%3c was assessed in the reign of that king was one hundred and %0a%3c %0a%3c 44 The first crime having been committed by him who introduced the %0a%3c use of gold rings.

Ogulnius and C. %0a%3c Fabius, five years before the First Punic "War ; at which time %0a%3c it was ordained that the value of the denarius should be ten %0a%3c librae" of copper, that of the quinarius five librae, and that %0a%3c of the sestertius two librae and a half. The weight, how- %0a%3c ever, of the libra of copper was diminished during the First %0a%3c Punic War, the republic not having means to meet its ex- %0a%3c penditure : in consequence of which, an ordinance was made %0a%3c that the as should in future be struck of two ounces weight. %0a%3c By this contrivance a saving of five-sixths was effected, and %0a%3c the public debt was liquidated. The impression upon these %0a%3c copper coins was a two-faced Janus on one side, and the beak %0a%3c of a ship of war on the other : the triens, 5S however, and the %0a%3c quadrans, 59 bore the impression of a ship. The quadrans, too, %0a%3c had, previously to this, been called " teruncius," as being three %0a%3c unciae 80 in weight. At a later period again, when Hannibal %0a%3c was pressing hard upon Rome, in the dictatorship of Q. Fabius %0a%3c Maximus, asses of one ounce weight were struck, and it was %0a%3c ordained that the value of the denarius should be sixteen asses, %0a%3c that of the quinarius eight asses, and that of the sestertius %0a%3c four asses ; by which last reduction of the weight of the as %0a%3c the republic made a clear gain cf one half. Still, however, %0a%3c 60 far as the pay of the soldiers is concerned, one denarius has %0a%3c always been given for every ten asses. The impressions upon %0a%3c the coins of silver were two-horse and four-horse chariots, %0a%3c and hence it is that they received the names of " bigati " and %0a%3c " quadrigati." %0a%3c %0a%3c Shortly after, in accordance with the Law of Papirius, asses %0a%3c were coined weighing half an ounce only. Livius Drusus, %0a%3c when 61 tribune of the people, alloyed the silver with one-eighth %0a%3c part of copper. The coin that is known at the present day %0a%3c as the "victoriatus," 62 was first struck in accordance with the %0a%3c %0a%3c 67 " Pounds " or " asses."

The impression upon it is a figure of Victory, %0a%3c and hence its name. %0a%3c %0a%3c The first golden coin was struck sixty-two years after that %0a%3c of silver, the scruple of gold being valued at twenty sesterces ; a %0a%3c computation which gave, according to the value of the sesterce %0a%3c then in use, nine hundred sesterces to each libra of gold. 63 %0a%3c In later times, again, an ordinance was made, that denarii of %0a%3c gold should be struck, at the rate of forty denarii 64 to each %0a%3c libra of gold ; after which period, the emperors gradually %0a%3c curtailed the weight of the golden denarius, until at last, in %0a%3c the reign of Nero, it was coined at the rate of forty-five to %0a%3c the libra. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 14. CONSIDEKATIONS ON MAN'S CUPIDITY FOR GOLD. %0a%3c %0a%3c But the invention of money opened a new field to human %0a%3c avarice, by giving rise to usury and the practice of lending %0a%3c money at interest, while the owner passes a life of idleness : %0a%3c and it was with no slow advances that, not mere avarice only, %0a%3c but a perfect hunger 65 for gold became inflamed with a sort of %0a%3c rage for acquiring : to such a degree, in fact, that Septimuleius, %0a%3c the familiar friend of Caius Gracchus, not only cut off his %0a%3c head, upon which a price had been set of its weight in gold, %0a%3c %0a%3c 63 As, originally, there were 288 "scripula," or scruples, to the "libra" or %0a%3c pound, this would appear to give 5760 sestertii to the pound of gold, and %0a%3c not 900 merely. Though this apparent discrepancy has generally puzzled %0a%3c the commentators, the solution, as suggested by M. Parisot, in the Notes %0a%3c to Ajasson's Translation, appears equally simple and satisfactory. He %0a%3c suggests that in the "as," or "libra," of two ounces, there were 288 %0a%3c scruples. Now, the scruple remaining the same, when the as or libra was %0a%3c reduced to one ounce, it would contain but 144 of these scruples. Then, %0a%3c on milking the as the sixteenth part of a denarius instead of the tenth, it %0a%3c would lose three-eighths of its value in scruples, or in other words, 54 %0a%3c scruples, thus making it worth but 90 scruples. Then again, as above %0a%3c stated, by the Papirian Law, the weight or value of the libra or as was %0a%3c reduced one-half, making its value in scruples only 45 ; or, in other words, %0a%3c five thirty-seconds of its original value, when worth two unciae or ounces. %0a%3c This number of scruples to the libra would give, at the rate of twenty %0a%3c 6esterces to the scruple of gold, exactly 900 sesterces to the libra of gold. %0a%3c %0a%3c 64 Or "aurei." %0a%3c %0a%3c 63 " Fames auri."

Till then, the most %0a%3c consummate instances of a similar licentiousness had been found %0a%3c among strangers only — that of King Philip, namely, who was in %0a%3c the habit of sleeping with a golden goblet placed beneath his pil- %0a%3c lows, and that of Hagnon of Teos, a commander under Alex- %0a%3c ander the Great, who used to fasten the soles of his sandals %0a%3c with nails of gold. 72 It was reserved for Antonius to be the %0a%3c only one thus to impart a certain utility to gold, by putting an %0a%3c %0a%3c 86 Another version of this story was, that he extracted the brain, and %0a%3c inserted lead in its place. «' See B. xiv. c. 16. %0a%3c %0a%3c 68 In B.C. 88, M.

TnE PEKSONS WHO HAVE POSSESSED THE GREATEST %0a%3c %0a%3c QUANTITY OF GOLD AND SILVER. %0a%3c %0a%3c For my own part, I am much surprised that the Roman peo- %0a%3c ple has always imposed upon conquered nations a tribute in %0a%3c silver, and not in gold ; Carthage, for instance, from which, %0a%3c upon its conquest under Hannibal, a ransom was exacted in %0a%3c the shape of a yearly 74 payment, for fifty years, of eight hun- %0a%3c dred thousand pounds' weight of silver, but no gold. And yet %0a%3c it does not appear that this could have arisen from there being %0a%3c so little gold then in use throughout the world. Midas and %0a%3c Croesus, before this, had possessed gold to an endless amount : %0a%3c Cyrus, already, on his conquest of Asia, 75 had found a booty %0a%3c consisting of twenty-four thousand pounds' weight of gold, %0a%3c in addition to vessels and other articles of wrought gold, as %0a%3c well as leaves 76 of trees, a plane-tree, and a vine, all made of %0a%3c that metal. %0a%3c %0a%3c It was through this conquest too, that he carried off fire %0a%3c hundred thousand 77 talents of silver, as well as the vase of %0a%3c Semiramis, 78 the weight of which alone amounted to fifteen %0a%3c talents, the Egyptian talent being equal, according to Varro, %0a%3c to eighty of our pounds. Before this time too, Saulaces, the %0a%3c descendant of iEetes, had reigned in Colchis, 79 who, on finding %0a%3c %0a%3c 73 A slave only ; and not by any of his brother patricians. Antony was %0a%3c rendered infamous by his proscriptions. %0a%3c %0a%3c 74 Appian and Livy mention the fine as consisting of ten thousand %0a%3c talents in all, or in other words, eight hundred thousand pounds of silver %0a%3c (at eighty pounds to the talent). Sillig is therefore of opinion that Pliny %0a%3c is in error here in inserting the word " annua." The payment of the tea %0a%3c thousand talents, we learn from the same authorities, was spread over fifty %0a%3c years. 75 Asia Minor, %0a%3c %0a%3c 76 "Folia."

Nay, even more than this, the oftener gold is sub- %0a%3c jected to the action of fire, the more refined in quality it be- %0a%3c comes ; indeed, fire is one test of its goodness, as, when sub- %0a%3c %0a%3c 93 a.u.c. 612. * See B. xix. c. 6. %0a%3c %0a%3c 95 Chapter 57. 96 In fact, no colour at all. %0a%3c %0a%3c 97 In this climate, the light of most of the stars has the complexion, not %0a%3c of gold, but of silver. 9 s The topaz, for instance. %0a%3c %0a%3c 99 For ductility and malleability, both which terms may perhaps be in- %0a%3c cluded in the "facilitas" of Pliny, gold is unrivalled among the metals, hi %0a%3c to weight, it is heavier than lead, the specific gravity of gold being 19.258, %0a%3c and that of lead 11 352.

OJ" %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c mitted to intense heat, gold ought to assume a similar colour, %0a%3c and turn red and igneous in appearance ; a mode of testing %0a%3c which is known as " obrussa." 3 %0a%3c %0a%3c The first great proof, however, of the goodness of gold, is %0a%3c its melting with the greatest difficulty : in addition to which, %0a%3c it is a fact truly marvellous, that though proof against the most %0a%3c intense fire, if made with wood charcoal, it will melt with the %0a%3c greatest readiness upon a fire made with chaff ; 4 and that, for %0a%3c the purpose of purifying it, it is fused with lead. 5 There is %0a%3c another reason too, which still more tends to enhance its value, %0a%3c the fact that it wears the least of all metals by continual use : %0a%3c whereas with silver, copper, and lead, lines may be traced, 6 and %0a%3c the hands become soiled with the substance that comes from off %0a%3c them. Nor is there any material more malleable than this, %0a%3c none that admits of a more extended division, seeing that a %0a%3c single ounce of it admits of being beaten out into seven hun- %0a%3c dred and fifty 7 leaves, or more, four fingers in length by the %0a%3c same in breadth. The thickest kind of gold-leaf is known as %0a%3c "leaf of Praeneste," it still retaining that name from the %0a%3c excellence of the gilding upon the statue of Fortune 8 there. %0a%3c The next in thickness is known as the " quaestorian leaf." In %0a%3c Spain, small pieces of gold are known by the name of " striges." 9 %0a%3c %0a%3c A thing that is not the case with any other metal, gold is %0a%3c found pure in masses 10 or in the form of dust; 11 and whereas %0a%3c %0a%3c 3 The gold thus tested was called " obrussum," " obryzum," or " obri- %0a%3c zum," from the Greek oj3pv£ov, meaning "pure gold." %0a%3c %0a%3c 4 See B. xviii. c. 23, where he calls the chaff used for this purpose by the %0a%3c name of " acus." %0a%3c %0a%3c 8 The present mode of assaying the precious metals, is by fusing them %0a%3c upon a cupel with lead. %0a%3c %0a%3c 6 For which purpose, lead was used, no doubt, in drawing the lines in the %0a%3c MSS. of the ancients. See Beckmann's Hist. Inv. Vol. II. p. 389.

To effect this %0a%3c mode of gilding, the copper is first well hammered, after which %0a%3c it is subjected to the action of fire, and then cooled with a %0a%3c mixture of salt, vinegar, and alum. 22 It is then cleansed of all %0a%3c extraneous substances, it being known by its brightness when %0a%3c it has been sufficiently purified. This done, it is again %0a%3c heated by fire, in order to enable it, when thus prepared, with %0a%3c the aid of an amalgam of pumice, alum, and quicksilver, to %0a%3c receive the gold leaf when applied.

The persons in search of gold %0a%3c in the first place remove the " segutilum," 27 such being the %0a%3c %0a%3c ployed for this cement, called ' leucophoron,' one may readily conceive %0a%3c that, it must have been a ferruginous ochre, or kind of bole, which is still %0a%3c used as a ground.

This done, a bed is made, the sand of which is washed, %0a%3c and, according to the residue found after washing, a conjecture %0a%3c is formed as to the richness of the vein. Sometimes, indeed, %0a%3c gold is found at once in the surface earth, a success, however, %0a%3c hut rarely experienced. .Recently, for instance, in the reign of %0a%3c Nero, a vein was discovered in Dalmatia, which yielded daily %0a%3c as much as fifty pounds' weight of gold. The gold that is %0a%3c thus found in the surface crust is known as " talutium," 28 ^ %0a%3c cases where there is auriferous earth beneath. The mountains %0a%3c of Spain, 29 in other respects arid and sterile, and productive of %0a%3c nothing whatever, are thus constrained by man to be fertile, %0a%3c in supplying him with this precious commodity. %0a%3c %0a%3c The gold that is extracted from shafts is known by some %0a%3c persons as " canalicium," and by others as " canaliense ;" 30 it %0a%3c is found adhering to the gritty crust of marble, 31 and, altogether %0a%3c different from the form in which it sparkles in the sapphirus 32 %0a%3c of the East, and in the stone of Thebais 33 and other gems, it %0a%3c is seen interlaced with the molecules of the marble. The %0a%3c channels of these veins are found running in various directions %0a%3c along the sides of the shafts, and hence the name of the gold %0a%3c they yield — "canalicium." 34 In these shafts, too, the su- %0a%3c perincumbent earth is kept from falling in by means of wooden %0a%3c pillars. The substance that is extracted is first broken up, %0a%3c and then washed ; after which it is subjected to the action of %0a%3c fire, and ground to a fine powder. This powder is known as %0a%3c " apitascudes," while the silver which becomes disengaged in %0a%3c the 35 furnace has the name of " sudor" 36 given to it.

In the %0a%3c case of gold, this scoria is broken up a second time, and melted %0a%3c over again. The crucibles used for this purpose are made of %0a%3c " tasconium," 37 a white earth similar to potter's clay in ap- %0a%3c pearance ; there being no other substance capable of with- %0a%3c standing the strong current of air, the action of the fixe, and %0a%3c the intense heat of the melted metal. %0a%3c %0a%3c The third method of obtaining gold surpasses the labours %0a%3c of the Giants 38 even : by the aid of galleries driven to a long %0a%3c distance, mountains are excavated by the light of torches, the %0a%3c duration of which forms the set times for work, the workmen %0a%3c never seeing the light of day for many months together. %0a%3c These mines are known as " arrugiae ;" 89 and not unfrequently %0a%3c clefts are formed on a sudden, the earth sinks in, and the work- %0a%3c men are crushed beneath ; so that it would really appear less rash %0a%3c to go in search of pearls and purples at the bottom of the sea, %0a%3c so much more dangerous to ourselves have we made the earth %0a%3c than the water ! Hence it is, that in this kind of mining, %0a%3c arches are left at frequent intervals for the purpose of sup- %0a%3c porting the weight of the mountain above. In mining either %0a%3c by shaft or by gallery, barriers of silex are met with, which %0a%3c have to be driven asunder by the aid of fire and vinegar ; 40 or %0a%3c more frequently, as this method fills the gallerieswith suffocating %0a%3c vapours and smoke, to be broken to pieces with bruising- %0a%3c machines shod with pieces of iron weighing one hundred and %0a%3c fifty pounds : which done, the fragments are carried out on the %0a%3c workmen's shoulders, night and day, each man passing them %0a%3c on to his neighbour in the dark, it being only those at the pit's %0a%3c mouth that ever see the light. In cases where the bed of silex %0a%3c appears too thick to admit of being penetrated, the miner traces %0a%3c alongthe sides of it, and so turns it. Andyet, after all, the labour %0a%3c entailed by this silex is looked upon as comparatively easy, there %0a%3c being an earth — a kind of potter's clay mixed with gravel, %0a%3c " gangadia" by name, which it is almost impossible to overcome. %0a%3c This earth has to be attacked with iron wedges and hammers %0a%3c %0a%3c 87 The cupel or crucible is still known in Spain by the name of tasco. %0a%3c %0a%3c 38 Who were said to have heaped one mountain on another in their war %0a%3c with the gods. %0a%3c %0a%3c 39 Deep mines in Spain are still called arrugia, a term also used to %0a%3c signify gold beneath the surface. According to Grimm, arrnzi was the %0a%3c ancient High German name lor iron. 40 See E. xxiii. c. 27. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 102 pliny's natural histokt. [Book XXXIII. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c like those previously mentioned, 41 and it is generally considered %0a%3c that there is nothing more stubborn in existence — except in- %0a%3c deed the greed for gold, which is the most stubborn of all things?. %0a%3c %0a%3c When these operations are all completed, beginning at the %0a%3c last, they cut away 42 the wooden pillars at the point where %0a%3c they support the roof: the coming downfall gives warning, %0a%3c which is instantly perceived by the sentinel, and by him only, %0a%3c who is set to watch upon a peak of the same mountain. By %0a%3c voice as well as by signals, he orders the workmen to be im- %0a%3c mediately summoned from their labours, and at the same %0a%3c moment takes to flight himself. The mountain, rent to pieces, %0a%3c is cleft asunder, hurling its debris to a distance with a crash %0a%3c which it is impossible for the human imagination to conceive ; %0a%3c and from the midst of a cloud of dust, of a density quite in- %0a%3c credible, the victorious miners gaze upon this downfall of %0a%3c Nature. Nor yet even then are they sure of gold, nor indeed %0a%3c were they by any means certain that there was any to he %0a%3c found when they first began to excavate, it being quite suf- %0a%3c ficient, as an inducement to undergo such perils and to incur %0a%3c such vast expense, to entertain the hope that they shall obtain %0a%3c what they so eagerly desire. %0a%3c %0a%3c Another labour, too, quite equal to this, and one which en- %0a%3c tails even greater expense, is that of bringing rivers 43 from %0a%3c the more elevated mountain heights, a distance in many in- %0a%3c stances of one hundred miles perhaps, for the purpose of %0a%3c washing these debris. The channels thus formed are called %0a%3c "corrugi," from our word " corrivatio," 44 1 suppose ; and even %0a%3c when these are once made, they entail a thousand fresh labours. %0a%3c The fall, for instance, must be steep, that the water may he %0a%3c precipitated, so to say, rather than flow ; and it is in this %0a%3c manner that it is brought from the most elevated points. %0a%3c Then, too, vallies and crevasses have to be united by the aid of %0a%3c aqueducts, and in another place impassable rocks have to be %0a%3c hewn away, and forced to make room for hollowed troughs of %0a%3c wood ; the person hewing them hanging suspended all the %0a%3c time with ropes, so that to a spectator who views the operations %0a%3c %0a%3c 41 The breaking-machines, used for crushing the silex. %0a%3c %0a%3c 42 " Csedunt" is certainly a preferable reading to " cadunt," though the %0a%3c latter is given by the Bamberg MS. %0a%3c %0a%3c 43 A similar method of washing auriferous earth or sand in the mines, %0a%3c is still employed in some cases. %0a%3c %0a%3c 44 "The bringing of water into one channel," %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 21.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c HOW GOLD IS FOUNT). %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 103 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c from a distance, the workmen have all the appearance, not so %0a%3c much of wild beasts, as of birds upon the wing. 45 Hanging %0a%3c thus suspended in most instances, they take the levels, and %0a%3c trace with lines the course the water is to take ; and thus, %0a%3c where there is no room even for man to plant a footstep, are %0a%3c rivers traced out by the hand of man. The water, too, is con- %0a%3c sidered in an unfit state for washing, if the current of the %0a%3c river carries any mud along with it. The kind of earth tbat %0a%3c yields this mud is known as " urium;" 46 and hence it is that %0a%3c in tracing out these channels, they carry the water over beds %0a%3c of silex or pebbles, and carefully avoid this urium. When %0a%3c they have reached the head of the fall, at the very brow of the %0a%3c mountain, reservoirs are hollowed out, a couple of hundred %0a%3c feet in length and breadth, and some ten feet in depth. In %0a%3c these reservoirs there are generally five sluices left, about %0a%3c three feet square ; so that, the moment the reservoir is filled, the %0a%3c floodgates are struck away, and the torrent bursts forth with %0a%3c such a degree of violence as to roll onwards any fragments of %0a%3c rock which may obstruct its passage. %0a%3c %0a%3c "When they have reached the level ground, too, there is %0a%3c still another labour that awaits them. Trenches — known as %0a%3c " agogae" 47 — have to be dug for the passage of the water; and %0a%3c these, at regular intervals, have a layer of ulex placed at the %0a%3c bottom. This ulex 48 is a plant like rosemary in appearance, %0a%3c rough and prickly, and well-adapted for arresting any pieces %0a%3c of gold that may be carried along. The sides, too, are closed %0a%3c in with planks, and are supported by arches when carried over %0a%3c steep and precipitous spots. The earth, carried onwards in %0a%3c the stream, arrives at the sea at last, and thus is the shattered %0a%3c mountain washed away ; causes which have greatly tended to %0a%3c extend the shores of Spain by these encroachments upon the %0a%3c deep.

In these excavations, %0a%3c too, it is found in lumps, as also in the shafts which are sunk, %0a%3c sometimes exceeding ten pounds even. The names given to %0a%3c these lumps are " palagse," and " palacurnse," 60 while the gold %0a%3c found in small grains is known as " baluce." The ulex that %0a%3c is used for the above purpose is dried and burnt, after which %0a%3c the ashes of it are washed upon a bed of grassy turf, in order %0a%3c that the gold may be deposited thereupon. %0a%3c %0a%3c Asturia, Gallaocia, and Lusitania furnish in this manner, %0a%3c yearly, according to some authorities, twenty thousand pounds' %0a%3c weight of gold, the produce of Asturia forming the major part. %0a%3c Indeed, there is no part of the world that for centuries has %0a%3c maintained such a continuous fertility in gold. I have already' 1 %0a%3c mentioned that by an ancient decree of the senate, the soil of %0a%3c Italy has been protected from these researches ; otherwise, %0a%3c there would be no land more fertile in metals. There is ex- > %0a%3c tant also a censorial law relative to the gold mines of Victumulae, %0a%3c in the territory of Vercellse, 52 by which the farmers of the %0a%3c revenue were forbidden to employ more than five thousand %0a%3c men at the works. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 22. OEPIMENT. %0a%3c %0a%3c There is also one other method of procuring gold ; by making %0a%3c it from orpiment, 53 a mineral dug from the surface of the earth %0a%3c in Syria, and much used by painters. It is just the colour of %0a%3c gold, but brittle, like mirror-stone, 54 in fact. This substance %0a%3c greatly excited the hopes of the Emperor Caius, 56 a prince who %0a%3c was most greedy for gold. He accordingly had a large quantity %0a%3c of it melted, and really did obtain some excellent gold ; i6 but %0a%3c then the proportion was so extremely small, that he found him- %0a%3c self a loser thereby. Such was the result of an experiment %0a%3c prompted solely by avarice : and this too, although the price %0a%3c %0a%3c 50 All these names, no doubt, are of Spanish origin, although Salmasius %0a%3c would assign them a Greek one. %0a%3c %0a%3c 5!

In one %0a%3c mine, and that only, the one known as the mine of Albucrara, %0a%3c in Gallaecia, 68 the proportion of silver is but one thirty-sixth : %0a%3c hence it is that the ore of this mine is so much mere valuable %0a%3c than that of others. Whenever the proportion of silver is one- %0a%3c fifth, the ore is known also by the name of " electrum;" 59 grains, %0a%3c too, of this metal are often found in the gold known as "canali- %0a%3c ense." 60 An artificial 61 electrum, too, is made, by mixing %0a%3c silver with gold. If the proportion of silver exceeds one-fifth, %0a%3c the metal offers no resistance on the anvil. %0a%3c %0a%3c Electrum, too, was highly esteemed in ancient times, as we %0a%3c learn from the testimony of Homer, who represents 62 the palace %0a%3c of Menelaiis as refulgent with gold and electrum, silver and %0a%3c ivory. At Lindos, in the island of Rhodes, there is a temple %0a%3c dedicated to Minerva, in which there is a goblet of electrum, %0a%3c consecrated by Helena : history states also that it was moulded %0a%3c after the proportions of her bosom. One peculiar advantage %0a%3c of electrum is, its superior brilliancy to silver by lamp-light. %0a%3c Xative electrum has also the property of detecting poisons ; %0a%3c for in such case, semicircles, resembling the rainbow in appear- %0a%3c ance, will form upon the surface of the goblet, and emit a %0a%3c crackling noise, like that of flame, thus givng a twofold indica- %0a%3c tion of the presence of poison. 63 %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 24.

To what par- %0a%3c ticular region this name belongs, we have already cs stated, it %0a%3c being that of a divinity 66 held in the highest veneration by %0a%3c the nations in that part of the world. This statue was carried %0a%3c off during the wars of Antonius with the people of Parthia ; %0a%3c and a witty saying is told, with reference to it, of one of the %0a%3c veterans of the ltoman army, a native of Bononia. Enter- %0a%3c taining on one occasion the late Emperor Augustus at dinner, %0a%3c he was asked by that prince whether he was aware that the %0a%3c person who was the first to commit this violence upon the %0a%3c statue, had been struck with blindness and paralysis, and then %0a%3c expired. To this he made answer, that at that very moment %0a%3c Augustus was making his dinner off of one of her legs, for that %0a%3c he himself was the very man, and to that bit of plunder he %0a%3c had been indebted for all his fortune. 67 %0a%3c %0a%3c As regards statues of human beings, Gorgias of Leontini 68 %0a%3c was the first to erect a solid statue of gold, in the Temple at %0a%3c Delphi, in honour of himself, about the seventieth 69 Olympiad : %0a%3c so great were the fortunes then made by teaching the art of %0a%3c oratory ! %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 25. EIGHT REMEDIES DEEIVED FROM GOLD. %0a%3c %0a%3c Gold is efficacious as a remedy in many ways, being applied %0a%3c to wounded persons and to infants, to render any malpractices %0a%3c of sorcery comparatively innocuous that may be directed against %0a%3c them. Gold, however, itself is mischievous in its effects if %0a%3c %0a%3c 65 In B. v. c. 20, most probably. See also B. xvi. c. 64. %0a%3c %0a%3c 65 The worship of Anaitis was probably a branch of the Indian worship %0a%3c of Nature. The Greek writers sometimes identify this goddess with their %0a%3c Artemis and their Aphrodite. %0a%3c %0a%3c 67 Holland has strangely mistaken the meaning of the veteran's reply; %0a%3c " Yea, sir, that it is ; and that methinks you should know best, for even %0a%3c now a leg of his you have at supper, and all your wealth besides is come %0a%3c unto you by that saccage." He then adds, by way of Note, " For Au- %0a%3c gustus Cassar defeited Antonie, and was mightily enriched by the spoile %0a%3c of him." %0a%3c %0a%3c « 9 In Sicily. According to Valerius Maximus and other writers, a statue %0a%3c of solid gold was erected by the whole of Greece, in the temple at Delphi, %0a%3c in honour of Gorgias, who was distinguished for his eloquence and literary %0a%3c attainments. The leading opinion of Gorgias was, that nothing had any %0a%3c real existence. %0a%3c %0a%3c 69 The ninetieth Olympiad, about the year 420 b.c, is much more pro- %0a%3c bably the correct reading ; as it was about the seventieth Olympiad, or some- %0a%3c what later, that Gorgias was born. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 26.] CEKTSOCOLLA. 107 %0a%3c %0a%3c carried over the head, in the case of chickens and lamhs more %0a%3c particularly. The proper remedy in such case is to wash the %0a%3c gold, and to sprinkle the water upon the objects which it is %0a%3c wished to preserve. Gold, too, is melted with twice its weight %0a%3c of salt, and three times its weight of misy ; 70 after which it is %0a%3c again melted with two parts of salt and one of the stone called %0a%3c " schistos." 71 Employed in this manner, it withdraws the %0a%3c natural acridity from the substances torrefied with it in the %0a%3c crucible, while at the same time it remains pure and incorrupt ; %0a%3c the residue forming an ash which is preserved in an earthen %0a%3c vessel, and is applied with water for the cure of lichens on the %0a%3c face : the best method of washing it off is with bean-meal. %0a%3c These ashes have the property also of curing fistulas and the %0a%3c discharges known as "hsemorrhoides:" with the addition, too, ot %0a%3c powdered pumice, they are a cure for putrid ulcers and sores %0a%3c which emit an offensive smell. %0a%3c %0a%3c Gold, boiled in honey with melanthium 72 and applied as a %0a%3c liniment to the navel, acts as a gentle purgative upon the %0a%3c bowels.

[Book XXXIII. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c factured ; much inferior, however, to the native chrysocolla. %0a%3c The method of preparing it consists in introducing water %0a%3c gradually into a vein of metal, throughout the winter and until %0a%3c the month of June ; after which, it is left to dry up during %0a%3c the months of June and July : so that, in fact, it is quite evident %0a%3c that chrysocolla is nothing else but the putrefaction of a metal, %0a%3c lie vein. Native chrysocolla, known as "uva," differs from %0a%3c the other in its hardness more particularly ; and yet, hard as %0a%3c it is, it admits of being coloured with the plant known as %0a%3c " lutum." 76 Like flax and wool, it is of a nature which imbibes %0a%3c liquids. For the purpose of dyeing it, it is first bruised in a %0a%3c mortar, after which, it is passed through a fine sieve. This %0a%3c done, it is ground, and then passed through a still finer sieve ; %0a%3c all that refuses to pass being replaced in the mortar, and sub- %0a%3c jected once more to the mill. The finest part of the powder is %0a%3c from time to time measured out into a crucible, where it is %0a%3c macerated in vinegar, so that all the hard particles may be %0a%3c dissolved ; after which, it is pounded again, and then rinsed %0a%3c in shell-shaped vessels, and left to dry. This done, the chry- %0a%3c socolla is dyed by the agency of schist alum 77 and the plant %0a%3c above-mentioned ; and thus is it painted itself before it serves %0a%3c to paint. It is of considerable importance, too, that it should %0a%3c be absorbent and readily take the dye : indeed, if it does not %0a%3c speedily take the colour, scytanum and turbistum' 8 are added to %0a%3c the dye ; such being the name of two drugs which compel it to %0a%3c absorb the colouring matter. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 27. THE USE MADE OF CHRYSOCOLLA IN PAINTING. %0a%3c %0a%3c _ When chrysocolla has been thus dyed, painters call it " oro- %0a%3c bitis," and distinguish two kinds of it, the cleansed 79 orobitis, 60 %0a%3c which is kept for making lomentum, 81 and the liquid, the balls %0a%3c %0a%3c 76 The " Keseda luteola," Dyer's weed, or "Wild woad.

The great point of its ex- %0a%3c cellence consists in its producing exactly the tint of corn when %0a%3c in a state of the freshest verdure. 84 Before now, we have seen, %0a%3c at the spectacles exhibited by the Emperor Nero, the arena of %0a%3c the Circus entirely sanded with chrysocolla, when the prince %0a%3c himself, clad in a dress of the same colour, was about to exhibit %0a%3c as a charioteer. 85 %0a%3c %0a%3c The unlearned multitude of artisans distinguish three %0a%3c kinds of chrysocolla ; the rough chrysocolla, which is valued %0a%3c at seven denarii per pound ; the middling, worth five denarii ; %0a%3c and the bruised, also known as the " herbaceous " chryso- %0a%3c colla, worth three denarii per pound. Before laying on the %0a%3c sanded 88 chrysocolla, they underlay coats of atramentum 87 %0a%3c and parsetonium, 88 substances which make it hold, and im- %0a%3c part a softness to the colours. The parsetonium, as it is %0a%3c naturally very unctuous, and, from its smoothness, extremely %0a%3c tenacious, is laid on first, and is then covered with a coat of %0a%3c atramentum, lest the paraDtonium, from its extreme whiteness, %0a%3c should impart a paleness to the chrysocolla. The kind known %0a%3c as "lutea," derives its name, it is thought, from the plant %0a%3c called " lutum ;" which itself is often pounded with cseru- %0a%3c leum 89 instead of real chrysocolla, and used for painting, %0a%3c %0a%3c present Chapter, and Chapter 57 of this Book.

From %0a%3c Suetonius, c. 18, we learn that the Emperor Caligula, also, had the Circus %0a%3c sanded with minium and chrysocolla.

THE CHRTSOCOLLA OF THE GOLDSMITHS, KNOWN ALSO %0a%3c %0a%3c AS SANTERNA. %0a%3c %0a%3c The goldsmiths also employ a chrysocolla 92 of their own, for %0a%3c the purpose of soldering gold ; and it is from this chrysocolla, %0a%3c they say, that all the other substances, which present a similar %0a%3c green, have received their name. This preparation is made %0a%3c from verdigris of Cyprian copper, the urine of a youth who %0a%3c has not arrived at puberty, and a portion of nitre. 93 It is then %0a%3c pounded with a pestle of Cyprian copper, in a copper mortar, %0a%3c and the name given to the mixture is " santerna." It is in this %0a%3c way that the gold known as " silvery " 94 gold is soldered ; one %0a%3c sign of its being so alloyed being its additional brilliancy on %0a%3c the application of santerna. If, on the other hand, the gold %0a%3c is impregnated with copper, it will contract, on coming in %0a%3c contact with the santerna, become dull, and only be soldered %0a%3c with the greatest difficulty : indeed, for this last kind of gold, %0a%3c there is a peculiar solder employed, made of gold and one- %0a%3c seventh part of silver, in addition to the materials above-men- %0a%3c tioned, the whole beaten up together. %0a%3c %0a%3c 90 As to durability, probablv. %0a%3c %0a%3c 91 It was tbe mineral, probably, in an unprepared state. %0a%3c %0a%3c 92 Gold-glue or gold- solder. %0a%3c %0a%3c 9 3 See B. xxxi. c. 46, as to tbe " nitrum " of Pliny.

The proper solder for gold is that above described ; %0a%3c for iron, potter's clay ; for copper, when in masses, cadmia, 9 * %0a%3c and in sheets, alum ; for lead and marble, resin. Lead is also %0a%3c united by the aid of white lead ; K white lead with white lead, %0a%3c by the agency of oil ; stannum, with copper file-dust ; and %0a%3c silver, with stannum. 97 %0a%3c %0a%3c For smelting copper and iron, pine-wood is the best, Egypt- %0a%3c ian papyrus being also very good for the purpose. Gold is %0a%3c melted most easily with a fire made of chaff'. 98 Limestone %0a%3c and Thracian stone" are ignited by the agency of water, this %0a%3c last being extinguished by the application of oil. Fire, how- %0a%3c ever, is extinguished most readily by the application of vinegar, %0a%3c viscus, 1 and unboiled eggs. Earth will under no circumstance %0a%3c ignite. When charcoal has been once quenched, and then again %0a%3c ignited, it gives out a greater heat than before. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 31. (6.)

When submitted, too, to the %0a%3c action of lire, part of the ore precipitates itself in the form of %0a%3c lead, 6 while the silver is left floating on the surface, 7 like oil %0a%3c on water. %0a%3c %0a%3c Silver is found in nearly all our provinces, but the finest of %0a%3c all is that of Spain ; where it is found, like gold, in unculti- %0a%3c vated soils, and in the mountains even. Wherever, too, one %0a%3c vein of silver has been met with, another is sure to be found %0a%3c not far off : a thing that has been remarked, in fact, in the case %0a%3c of nearly all the metals, which would appear from this cir- %0a%3c cumstance to have derived their Greek name of "metalla.'' 8 It %0a%3c is a remarkable fact, that the shafts opened by Hannibal 9 in %0a%3c the Spanish provinces are still worked, their names being de- %0a%3c rived from the persons who were the first to discover them. %0a%3c One of these mines, which at the present day is still called Bsebelo, %0a%3c furnished Hannibal with three hundred pounds' weight of silver %0a%3c per day. The mountain is already excavated for a distance of %0a%3c fifteen hundred 10 paces; and throughout the whole of this %0a%3c distance there are water-bearers 11 standing night and day, %0a%3c baling out the water in turns, regulated by the light of torches, %0a%3c and so forming quite, a river. %0a%3c %0a%3c The vein of silver that is found nearest the surface is known %0a%3c %0a%3c 4 "Plumbum nigrum"— "Black lead," literally : so called by the ancients, %0a%3c in contradistinction to "plumbum alburn," "white lead," our " tin," %0a%3c probably. %0a%3c %0a%3c 5 Lead ore ; identified with " molybdaena " in B. xxxiv. c. 53.

The exhalations from silver-mines are dan- %0a%3c gerous to all animals, but to dogs more particularly. The %0a%3c softer they are, the more beautiful gold and silver are con- %0a%3c sidered.

QUICKSILVER. %0a%3c %0a%3c There is a mineral also found in these veins of silver, which %0a%3c yields a humour that is always 16 liquid, and is known as %0a%3c "quicksilver." 17 It acts as a poison 18 upon everything, and %0a%3c pierces vessels even, making its way through them by the %0a%3c agency of its malignant properties. 19 AH substances float upon %0a%3c the surface of quicksilver, with the exception of gold, 20 this %0a%3c being the only substance that it attracts to itself. 21 Hence %0a%3c it is, that it is such an excellent refiner of gold ; for, on being %0a%3c briskly shaken in an earthen vessel with gold, it rejects all %0a%3c the impurities that are mixed with it. When once it has thus %0a%3c expelled these superfluities, there is nothing to do but to sepa- %0a%3c rate it from the gold ; to effect which, it is poured out upon %0a%3c skins that have been well tawed, and so, exuding through them %0a%3c like a sort of perspiration, it leaves the gold in a state of %0a%3c purity behind. 22 %0a%3c %0a%3c 12 Meaning " raw" silver, apparently. %0a%3c %0a%3c 13 " Alumen."

[Book XXXIII. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence it is, too, that when copper has to be gilded, 25 a coat of %0a%3c quicksilver is laid beneath the gold leaf, which it retains in its %0a%3c place with the greatest tenacity : in cases, however, where the %0a%3c leaf is single, or very thin, the presence of the quicksilver is %0a%3c detected by the paleness of the colour. 24 For this reason, per- %0a%3c sons, when meditating a piece of fraud, have been in the habit %0a%3c of substituting glair of egg for quicksilver, and then laying %0a%3c upon it a coat of hydrargyros, a substance of which we shall %0a%3c make further mention in the appropriate place. 24 Generally- %0a%3c speaking, quicksilver has not been found in any large quantities. %0a%3c %0a%3c appears from Pliny, that the ancients were acquainted with amalgam and %0a%3c its use, not only for separating gold and silver from earthy particles, but %0a%3c also for gilding." — Beckmann, Hist. Inv., Vol. I. p. 15. Bohn's Edition. %0a%3c %0a%3c 23 See the description of the mode of gilding, given in Chapter 20 of %0a%3c this Book. Beckmann has the following remarks on the present passage: %0a%3c " That gold-leaf was affixed to metals by means of quicksilver, with the as- %0a%3c sistance of heat, in the time of Pliny, we are told by himself in more passages %0a%3c than one. The metal to be gilded was prepared by salts of every kind, %0a%3c and rubbed with pumice-stone in order to clean it thoroughly (see Chapter %0a%3c 20), and to render the surface a little rough. This process is similar to %0a%3c that used at present for gilding with amalgam, by means of heat, especially %0a%3c as amalgamation was known to the ancients. But, to speak the truth, %0a%3c Pliny says nothing of heating the metal after the gold is applied, or of %0a%3c evaporating the quicksilver, but of drying the cleaned metal before the %0a%3c gold is laid on. Had he not mentioned quicksilver, his gilding might %0a%3c have been considered as that with gold leaf by means of heat, dorure en %0a%3c feuille a feu, in which the gold is laid upon the metal after it has been %0a%3c cleaned and heated, and strongly rubbed with blood-stone, or polished steel. %0a%3c Felibien (Principes de I' Architecture. Paris, 1676, p. 280) was undoubt- %0a%3c edly right when he regretted that the process of the ancients, the excellence %0a%3c of which is proved by remains of antiquity, has been lost." — Hist. Inv. %0a%3c Vol. II. pp. 294, 295. Bohn's Edition. %0a%3c %0a%3c u Beckmann finds considerable difficulties in this description—" I ac- %0a%3c knowledge that this passage I do not fully comprehend. It seems to say %0a%3c that the quicksilver, when the gold was laid on too thin, appeared through %0a%3c it, but that this might be prevented by mixing with the quicksilver the %0a%3c white of an egg. The quicksilver then remained under the gold: a thing %0a%3c which is impossible. When the smallest drop of quicksilver falls upon %0a%3c gilding, it corrodes the noble metal, and produces an empty spot. It is, %0a%3c therefore, incomprehensible to me how this could be prevented by using %0a%3c the white of an egg. Did Pliny himself completely understand gilding? %0a%3c Perhaps he only meant to say that many artists gave out the cold-gildiug. %0a%3c where the gold-leaf was laid on with the white of an e^o- as oildino- bv %0a%3c means of heat."— Hist.

He thinks it possible, also, that it may have %0a%3c derived its Greek name " larbason," or " larbasis," from its brittleness. %0a%3c %0a%3c 94 Ajasson thinks that under this name, crude antimony or sulphuret of %0a%3c antimony may have been included ; as also sulphuret of lead, sulphuret of %0a%3c antimony and copper, and sulphuret of antimony and silver ; the last ot %0a%3c which is often found covered with an opaque pellicle. %0a%3c %0a%3c 25 " Globis."

The part that has fallen to %0a%3c the bottom of the vessel is regarded as the choicest 31 part, and %0a%3c is left, covered with a linen cloth, to dry in the sun, but not %0a%3c to become parched. This done, it is again pounded in a %0a%3c mortar, and then divided into tablets. But the main thing of %0a%3c all is, to observe such a degree of nicety in heating it, as not %0a%3c to let it become lead. 32 Some persons, when • preparing it on %0a%3c the fire, use grease 33 instead of dung. Others, again, bruise it %0a%3c in water and then pass it through a triple strainer of linen %0a%3c cloth ; after which, they reject the lees, and pour off the %0a%3c remainder of the liquid, collecting all that is deposited at the %0a%3c bottom, and using it as an ingredient in plasters and eye- salves. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 35. — THE SCORIA OF SILVEB.

It is employed also for the cure of %0a%3c tenesmus aDd dysentery, being injected in the form of a clyster %0a%3c with myrtle-oil. It forms an ingredient, too, in the medica- %0a%3c ments known as " liparae," 36 for the removal of fleshy excres- %0a%3c cences in sores, ulcerations arising from chafing, or running %0a%3c ulcers on the head. %0a%3c %0a%3c The same mines also furnish us with the preparation known %0a%3c as " scum of silver." 37 There are three 38 varieties of it ; the %0a%3c best, known as " chrysitis ;" the second best, the name of %0a%3c which is " argyritis ;" and a third kind, which is called %0a%3c " molybditis." In most instances, too, all these tints are to %0a%3c be found in the same cake. 39 %0a%3c %0a%3c The most approved kind is that of Attica ; the next being %0a%3c that which comes from Spain. Chrysitis is the produce of %0a%3c the metallic vein, 40 argyritis is obtained from the silver itself, %0a%3c and molybditis is the result of the smelting of lead, 41 a work %0a%3c that is done at Puteoli ; to which last circumstance, in fact, mo- %0a%3c lybditis owes its name. 42 All' these substances are prepared in %0a%3c the following manner : the metal is first melted, and then al- %0a%3c lowed to flow from a more elevated receiver into a lower. From %0a%3c this last it is lifted by the aid of iron spits, and is then twirled %0a%3c round at the end of the spit in the midst of the flames, in %0a%3c order to make it all the lighter.

Or perhaps, he thinks, they may have been the respec- %0a%3c tive names of yellow or golden litharge, white or silver litharge, and terne. %0a%3c With the latter opinion Delafosse seems to coincide. %0a%3c %0a%3c 39 " Tubulis."

For the purpose of separating the charcoal %0a%3c and ashes from it, it is then rinsed with vinegar or with wine, %0a%3c and is so quenched. In the case of argyritis, it is recom- %0a%3c mended, in order to blanch it, to break it into pieces the size %0a%3c of a bean, and then to boil it with water in an earthen vessel, %0a%3c first putting with it, wrapped in linen cloths, some new wheat %0a%3c and barley, which are left there till they have lost the outer %0a%3c coat. This done, they bruise the whole in mortars for six con- %0a%3c secutive days, taking care to rinse the mixture in cold water %0a%3c three times a day, and after that, in an infusion of hot %0a%3c water and fossil salt, one obolus of the latter to every pound %0a%3c of scum : at the end of the six days it is put away for keep- %0a%3c ing in a vessel of lead. %0a%3c %0a%3c Some persons boil it with white beans and a ptisan 47 of %0a%3c barley, and then dry it in the sun ; others, again, with white %0a%3c wool and beans, till such time as it imparts no darkness to the %0a%3c wool ; after which, first adding fossil 48 salt, they change the %0a%3c water from time to time, and then dry it during the forty hot- %0a%3c test days of summer. In some instances the practice is, to %0a%3c boil it in water in a swine's paunch, and then to take it out %0a%3c and rub it with nitre ; after which, following the preceding %0a%3c method, they pound it in a mortar with salt.

(7.) — MINIUM : FOR WHAT RELIGIOUS PURPOSES IT %0a%3c WAS USED BY THE ANCIENTS. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is also in silver-mines that minium 50 is found, a pigment %0a%3c held at the present day in very high estimation ; and by the %0a%3c Romans in former times not only held in the highest estima- %0a%3c tion, but used for sacred purposes as well. Verrius enume- %0a%3c rates certain authors, upon whose testimony we find it satis- %0a%3c factorily established that it was the custom upon festivals to %0a%3c colour the face of the statue of Jupiter even with minium, as %0a%3c well as the bodies 51 of triumphant generals ; and that it was %0a%3c in this guise that Camillus celebrated his triumph. We find, %0a%3c too, that it is through the same religious motives that it is %0a%3c employed at the present day for colouring the unguents used %0a%3c at triumphal banquets, and that it is the first duty of the %0a%3c censors to make a contract for painting the statue of Jupiter" %0a%3c with this colour. %0a%3c %0a%3c For my own part, I am quite at a loss for the origin of this %0a%3c usage ; but it is a well-known fact, that at the present day %0a%3c even, minium is in great esteem with the nations of ^Ethiopia, %0a%3c their nobles being in the habit of staining the body all over %0a%3c with it, and this being the colour appropriated to the statues %0a%3c %0a%3c 49 In this Chapter.

He states, %0a%3c also, that in his own time, it was already found in Spain, but %0a%3c of a harsh and sandy nature ; as also in Colchis, upon a cer- %0a%3c tain inaccessible rock there, from which it was brought down %0a%3c by the agency of darts. This, however, he says, was only an %0a%3c adulterated kind of minium, the best of all being that pro- %0a%3c cured in the Cilbian Plains, 53 above Ephesus, the sand of which %0a%3c has just the colour of the kermes berry. 54 This sand, he in- %0a%3c forms us, is first ground to powder and then washed, the %0a%3c portion that settles at the bottom being subjected to a second %0a%3c washing. From this circumstance, he says, arises a difference %0a%3c in the article ; some persons being in the habit of preparing %0a%3c their minium with a single washing, while with others it is %0a%3c more diluted. The best kind, however, he says, is that which %0a%3c has undergone a second washing. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 38. CINNABARIS. %0a%3c %0a%3c I am not surprised that this colour should have been held %0a%3c in such high esteem ; for already, in the days of the Trojan %0a%3c "War, rubrica 55 was highly valued, as appears from the testi- %0a%3c mony of Homer, who particularly notices the ships that were %0a%3c coloured with it, whereas, in reference to other colours and %0a%3c paintings, he but rarely notices them. The Greeks call this %0a%3c red earth "miltos," and give to minium the name of "cinna- %0a%3c baris," and hence the error 56 caused by the two meanings of %0a%3c %0a%3c s 3 See B. v. c. 31. 54 See B. xvi. c. 12, and B. xxiv. c. 4. %0a%3c %0a%3c 55 The same as the miltos mentioned below, " miltos" being the word %0a%3c used by Homer, II. II. 637. This substance is totally different from the %0a%3c minium of the preceding Chapters, and from that mentioned in c. 40. It %0a%3c is our red ochre, peroxide of iron, mixed in a greater or less degree with %0a%3c argillaceous earth. %0a%3c %0a%3c s« See B. xxix. c. 8 ; where he speaks of the mistake made by the phy- %0a%3c sicians in giving mineral vermilion or minium to their patients instead of %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 40.] THE VARIOUS KINDS OF MINIUM. 121 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c the same word ; this being properly the name given to the %0a%3c thick matter which issues from the dragon when crushed be- %0a%3c neath the weight of the dying elephant, mixed with the blood %0a%3c of either animal, as already described." Indeed this last is the %0a%3c only colour that in painting gives a proper representation of %0a%3c blood. This cinnabaris, too, is extremely useful as an ingre- %0a%3c dient in antidotes and various medicaments. But, by Her- %0a%3c cules ! our physicians, because minium also has the name of %0a%3c " cinnabaris," use it as a substitute for the other, and so em- %0a%3c ploy a poison, as we shall shortly 58 show it to be. %0a%3c %0a%3c CnAP. 39. THE EMPLOYMENT OF CINNABARIS IN PAINTING. %0a%3c %0a%3c The ancients used to paint with cinnabaris 59 those pictures %0a%3c of one colour, which are still known among us as " monochro- %0a%3c mata." 60 They painted also with the minium of Ephesus : 61 %0a%3c but the use of this last has been abandoned, from the vast %0a%3c trouble which the proper keeping of the picture entailed. And %0a%3c then besides, both these colours were thought to be too harsh ; %0a%3c the consequence of which is, that painters have now adopted %0a%3c the use of rubrica 62 and of sinopis, substances of which I shall %0a%3c make further mention in the appropriate places. 63 %0a%3c %0a%3c Cinnabaris 64 is adulterated by the agency of goats' blood, or %0a%3c of bruised sorb-apples. The price of genuine cinnabaris is fifty %0a%3c sesterces per pound. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 40. THE VARIOUS KINDS OF MINIUM. THE USE MADE OF %0a%3c %0a%3c IT IN PAINTING. %0a%3c %0a%3c According to Juba minium is also a production of Carmania, 65 %0a%3c and Timagenes says that it is found in ^Ethiopia. But from %0a%3c neither of those regions is it imported to Borne, nor, indeed, %0a%3c %0a%3c Indian cinnabar. The latter substance is probably identical with that %0a%3c which is now used for varnishes, being imported from India, and still %0a%3c known as " dragons' blood," the resin of the Ptero-carpus draco, or Cala- %0a%3c mus palm. 57 In B. viii. c. 12. 68 In Chapter 41. %0a%3c %0a%3c 59 The dragon's blood, mentioned in the preceding Chapter. %0a%3c %0a%3c 60 " Single colour paintings."

Indeed there is nothing guarded with a more constant %0a%3c circumspection ; for it is not allowable to reduce and refine %0a%3c the ore upon the spot, it being brought to Rome in a crude %0a%3c state and under seal, to the amount of about two thousand %0a%3c pounds per annum. At Eome, the process of washing is per- %0a%3c formed, and, in the sale of it, the price is regulated by statute ; %0a%3c it not being allowed to exceed 67 seventy sesterces per pound. %0a%3c There are numerous ways, however, of adulterating it, a source %0a%3c of considerable plunder to the company. 68 %0a%3c %0a%3c For there is, in fact, another kind 69 of minium, found in most %0a%3c silver-mines as well as lead-mines, and prepared by the calcina- %0a%3c tion of certain stones that are found mixed with the metallic %0a%3c vein — not the minerals, however, to the fluid humours of %0a%3c which we have given 10 the name of quicksilver ; for if those are %0a%3c subjected to the action of fire they will yield silver — but another %0a%3c kind of stone 7 ' that is found with them.

After being %0a%3c duly calcined they are pulverized, and thus form a minium of %0a%3c second-rate quality, known to but very few, and far inferior %0a%3c to the produce of the native sand that we have mentioned." %0a%3c It is with this substance, then, as also with syricum, that %0a%3c the genuine minium is adulterated in the manufactories of the %0a%3c company. How syricum is prepared we shall describe in the %0a%3c appropriate place. 74 One motive, however, for giving an under- %0a%3c coat of 6yricum to minium, is the evident saving of expense %0a%3c that results therefrom.

In the mines of Sisapo, the veins are %0a%3c composed exclusively of the sandy particles of minium, with- %0a%3c out the intermixture of any silver whatever ; the practice being %0a%3c to melt it like gold. Minium is assayed by the agency of gold %0a%3c in a state of incandescence : if it has been adulterated, it will %0a%3c turn black, but if genuine, it retains its colour. I find it %0a%3c stated also that minium is adulterated with lime ; the proper %0a%3c mode of detecting which, is similarly to employ a sheet of red %0a%3c hot iron, if there should happen to be no gold at hand. %0a%3c %0a%3c To objects painted with minium the action of the sun and %0a%3c moon is highly injurious. The proper method of avoiding %0a%3c this inconvenience, is to dry the wall, and then to apply, with %0a%3c a hair brush, hot Punic wax, melted with oil ; after which, %0a%3c the varnish must be heated, with an application of gall-nuts, %0a%3c burnt to a red heat, till it quite perspires.

REMEDIES DERIVED FROM %0a%3c MINIUM. %0a%3c %0a%3c Human industry has also discovered a method of extracting %0a%3c hydrargyros 79 from the inferior minium, a substitute for quick- %0a%3c silver, the further mention of which was deferred, a few pages %0a%3c before, 80 to the present occasion. There are two methods of %0a%3c preparing this substance ; either by pounding minium and %0a%3c vinegar with a brazen pestle and mortar, or else by putting %0a%3c minium into flat earthen pans, covered with a lid, and then %0a%3c enclosed in an iron seething-pot well luted with potter's clay. %0a%3c A fire is then lighted under the pans, and the flame kept con- %0a%3c tinually burning by the aid of the bellows ; which done, the %0a%3c Steam is carefully removed, that is found adhering to the lid, %0a%3c being like silver in colour, and similar to water in its fluidity. %0a%3c This liquid, too, is easily made to separate in globules, which, %0a%3c from their fluid nature, readily unite. 81 %0a%3c %0a%3c As it is a fact generally admitted, that minium is a poison, 82 %0a%3c I look upon all the recipes given as highly dangerous which %0a%3c recommend its employment for medicinal purposes ; with the %0a%3c exception, perhaps, of those cases in which it is applied to the %0a%3c head or abdomen, for the purpose of arresting haemorrhage, %0a%3c due care being taken that it is not allowed to penetrate to the %0a%3c viscera, or to touch any sore. Beyond such cases as these, for %0a%3c my own part, I should never recommend it to be used in %0a%3c medicine. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 42. THE METHOD OF GILDING SILVER. %0a%3c %0a%3c At the present day silver is gilded almost exclusively by %0a%3c the agency of hydrargyros j 83 and a similar method should %0a%3c always be employed in laying gold leaf upon copper. But %0a%3c the same fraud which ever shows itself so extremely inge- %0a%3c nious in all departments of human industry, has devised a %0a%3c %0a%3c 79 Or artificial quicksilver. In reality, hydrargyrus is prepared from the %0a%3c genuine minium of Pliny, the cinnabar mentioned in Chapter 36 : it being %0a%3c obtained by the sublimation of 6ulphuret of mercury %0a%3c %0a%3c 80 In Chapters 20 and 32. %0a%3c %0a%3c 81 This, probably, is the meaning of " lubrico humore comnluere " %0a%3c 83 See the end of Chapter 38. r %0a%3c %0a%3c 83 Artificial quicksilver is still used for this purpose.

By some persons it is known as %0a%3c the " Heraclian," and by others as the "Lydian" stone. It %0a%3c is found in pieces of moderate size, and never exceeding four %0a%3c inches in length by two in breadth. The side that has lain %0a%3c facing the sun is superior 87 to that which has lain next to the %0a%3c ground. Persons of experience in these matters, when they %0a%3c have scraped a particle off the ore with this stone, as -with a %0a%3c file, can tell in a moment the proportion of gold there is in it, %0a%3c how much silver, or how much copper ; and this to a scruple, %0a%3c their accuracy being so marvellous that they are never mis- %0a%3c taken. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 44. THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF SILVER, AND THE MODES %0a%3c %0a%3c OP TESTING IT. %0a%3c %0a%3c There are two kinds of silver. On placing a piece of it %0a%3c upon an iron fire-shovel at a white heat, if the metal remains %0a%3c perfectly white, it is of the best quality : if again it turns of a %0a%3c reddish colour, it is inferior ; but if it becomes black, it is %0a%3c worthless. Fraud, however, has devised means of stultifying %0a%3c this test even ; for by keeping the shovel immersed in men's %0a%3c urine, the piece of silver absorbs it as it burns, and so displays %0a%3c a fictitious whiteness. There is also a kind of test with %0a%3c reference to polished silver : when the human breath comes %0a%3c %0a%3c 81 In Chapter 32.

(9.) — jinatoits. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is generally supposed among us that it is only the very %0a%3c finest silver that admits of being laminated, and so converted %0a%3c into mirrors. Pure silver was formerly used for the purpose, %0a%3c but, at the present day, this too has been corrupted by the %0a%3c devices of fraud. But, really, it is a very marvellous property %0a%3c that this metal has, of reflecting objects ; a property which, it %0a%3c is generally agreed, results from the repercussion of the air, 69 %0a%3c thrown back as it is from the metal upon the eyes. The %0a%3c same too is the action that takes place when we use a mirror. %0a%3c If, again, a thick plate of this metal is highly polished, and is %0a%3c rendered slightly concave, 90 the image or object reflected is %0a%3c enlarged to an immense extent ; so vast is the difference be- %0a%3c tween a surface receiving, 91 and throwing back the air. Even %0a%3c more than this — drinking-cups are now made in such a %0a%3c manner, as to be filled inside with numerous 92 concave facets, %0a%3c like so many mirrors ; so that if but one person looks into the %0a%3c interior, he sees reflected a whole multitude of persons. %0a%3c %0a%3c Mirrors, too, have been invented to reflect monstrous 93 %0a%3c forms ; those, for instance, which have been consecrated in the %0a%3c Temple at Smyrna. This, however, all results from the con- %0a%3c figuration given to the metal ; and it makes all the difference %0a%3c whether the surface has a concave form like the section of a %0a%3c drinking cup, or whether it is [convex] like a Thracian 94 %0a%3c buckler ; whether it is depressed in the middle or elevated ; %0a%3c whether the surface has a direction 95 transversely or ob- %0a%3c liquely ; or whether it runs horizontally or vertically ; the %0a%3c peculiar configuration of the surface which receives the shadows, %0a%3c %0a%3c 38 This seems to be the meaning of " si sudet pvotinus." %0a%3c %0a%3c 89 A very far-fetched explanation, and very wide of the mark. %0a%3c %0a%3c 90 « p au i um propulsa." %0a%3c %0a%3c 91 Which he supposes a concave surface to do. %0a%3c %0a%3c 92 This passage is noticed by Beckniana, in his account of Mirrors ; %0a%3c Vol. II. p. 58.

But as the ancient plates of silver %0a%3c were not transparent, how could the gold at the back of them produce any %0a%3c effect in regard to the image ? May not the meaning be that a thin plate %0a%3c of gold was placed at some distance before the mirror, in order to throw %0a%3c more light upon its surface ? "Whatever may have been the case, Pliny %0a%3c himselfcseems not to have had much confidence in the invention." — Beck- %0a%3c mann, Hist. Inv. Vol. II. p. 62. %0a%3c %0a%3c 3 Dr. Watson (Chemical Essays, Vol. IV. p. 246) seems to think that %0a%3c Pliny is here speaking of glass mirrors : " If we admit that Pliny was %0a%3c acquainted with glass mirrors, we may thus understand what he says %0a%3c respecting an invention which was then new, of applying gold behind a %0a%3c mirror. Instead of an amalgam of tin, some one had proposed to cover %0a%3c the back of the mirror with an amalgam of gold, with which the ancients %0a%3c were certainly acquainted, and which they employed in gilding." See %0a%3c Chapter 20 of the present Hook. On the above passage by Dr. Watson, %0a%3c Ucckmann has the following remarks: " This conjecture appears, at any %0a%3c rate, to be ingenious ; but when I read the passage again, without pre- %0a%3c judice, I can hardly believe that Pliny alludes to a plate of glass in aplace %0a%3c where he speaks only of metallic mirrors; and the overlaying with amal- %0a%3c gam requires too much art to allow me to ascribe it to such a period with- %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 128 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c plint's natural history. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XXXIII. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP 46. — EGYPTIAN SILVER. %0a%3c %0a%3c The people of Egypt stain their silver vessels, that they %0a%3c may see represented in them their god Anubis ; 4 and it is the %0a%3c custom with them to paint, 6 and not to chase, their silver. %0a%3c This usage has now passed to our own triumphal statues even; %0a%3c and, a truly marvellous fact, the value of silver has been %0a%3c enhanced by deadening its brilliancy. 6 The following is the %0a%3c method adopted : with the silver are mixed two- thirds of the %0a%3c very finest Cyprian copper, that known as " coronarium,'" %0a%3c and* a proportion of live sulphur equal to that of the silver. %0a%3c The whole of these are then melted in an earthen vessel well %0a%3c luted with potter's clay, the operation being completed when %0a%3c the cover becomes detached from the vessel. Silver admits %0a%3c also of being blackened with the yolk of a hard-boiled egg ; a %0a%3c tint, however, which is removed by the application of vinegar %0a%3c and chalk. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Triumvir Antonius alloyed the silver denarius with %0a%3c iron : and in spurious coin there is an alloy of copper em- %0a%3c ployed. Some, again, curtail 8 the proper weight of our de- %0a%3c narii, the legitimate proportion being eighty-four denarii to a %0a%3c pound of silver. It was in consequence of these frauds that a %0a%3c method was devised of assaying the denarius : the law ordain- %0a%3c ing which was so much to the taste of the plebeians, that in %0a%3c every quarter of the City there was a full - length statue %0a%3c erected 9 in honour of Marius Gratidianus.

PERSONS %0a%3c %0a%3c WHO HAVE POSSESSED THE GREATEST SUMS OF MONEY. %0a%3c %0a%3c The ancients had no number whereby to express a larger %0a%3c sum than one hundred thousand ; and hence it is that, at %0a%3c the present day, we reckon by multiples of that number, as, %0a%3c for instance, ten times one hundred thousand, and so on. 11 For %0a%3c these multiplications we are indebted to usury and the use of %0a%3c coined money ; and hence, too, the expression " ses alienum," %0a%3c or " another man's money," which we still use. 12 In later %0a%3c times, again, the surname "Dives" 13 was given to some: only %0a%3c be it known to all, that the man who first received this sur- %0a%3c name became a bankrupt and so bubbled his creditors. 14 M. %0a%3c Crassus, 15 a member of the same family, used to say that no %0a%3c man was rich, who could not maintain a legion upon his yearly %0a%3c income. He possessed in land two hundred millions 16 of %0a%3c sesterces, being the richest Roman citizen next to Sylla. Nor %0a%3c was even this enough for him, but he must want to possess all %0a%3c the gold of the Parthians too !" And yet, although he was the %0a%3c first to become memorable for his opulence — so pleasant is the %0a%3c task of stigmatizing this insatiate cupidity — we have known %0a%3c of many manumitted slaves, since his time, much more %0a%3c wealthy than he ever was ; three for example, all at the same %0a%3c %0a%3c sold for the purpose of showing the difference between it and the genuine %0a%3c coin. %0a%3c %0a%3c 11 Twenty times one hundred thousand, &c. %0a%3c %0a%3c 11 As signifying a " debt owing to another." 13 "The Rich." %0a%3c %0a%3c 14 This seems the best translation for " decoxisse creditoribus suis," %0a%3c which literally means that he "boiled " or " melted away" his fortune from %0a%3c his creditors.

Carvilius Pollio, 44 a %0a%3c Roman of equestrian rank, was the first, it is said, to adorn %0a%3c these last with silver ; not, I mean, to plate them all over, nor %0a%3c yet to make them after the Delian pattern ; the Punic 45 fashion %0a%3c being the one he adopted. It was after this last pattern too, %0a%3c that he had them ornamented with gold as well : and it was %0a%3c not long after his time that silver couches came into fashion, %0a%3c in imitation of the couches of Delos.

In the reign of Claudius, his slave Drusillanus, %0a%3c surnamed Rotundus, who acted as his steward 47 in Nearer %0a%3c Spain, possessed a silver charger weighing five hundred %0a%3c pounds, for the manufacture of which a workshop had had to be %0a%3c expressly built.

Fenestella, who died at the %0a%3c end of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, informs us that at that %0a%3c period sideboards, inlaid even with tortoiseshell, 50 * had come %0a%3c into fashion ; whereas, a little before his time, they had been %0a%3c made of solid wood, of a round shape, and not much larger %0a%3c than our tables. He says, however, that when he was quite %0a%3c a boy, they had begun to make the sideboards square, and of %0a%3c different 51 pieces of wood, or else veneered with maple or %0a%3c citrus : 52 and that at a later period the fashion was introduced %0a%3c of overlaying the corners and the seams at the joinings with %0a%3c silver. The name given to them in his youth, he says, was %0a%3c " tympana ;" 53 and it was at this period, too, that the chargers %0a%3c which had been known as " magides" by the ancients, first %0a%3c received the name of " lances," from their resemblance 54 to the %0a%3c scales of a balance. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAT. 53. — THE ENOEMOTJS TEICE OF SILVEE PLATE. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is not, however, only for vast quantities of plate that there %0a%3c is such a rage among mankind, but even more so, if possible, %0a%3c for the plate of peculiar artists : and this too, to the exculpa- %0a%3c tion of our own age, has long been the case. C. Gracchus %0a%3c possessed some silver dolphins, for which he paid five thou- %0a%3c sand sesterces per pound. Lucius Crassus, the orator, paid %0a%3c for two goblets chased by the hand of the artist Mentor, 55 one %0a%3c hundred thousand sesterces : but he confessed that for very %0a%3c shame he never dared use them, as also that he had other %0a%3c articles of plate in his possession, for which he had paid at %0a%3c the rate of six thousand sesterces per pound.

We learn, however, from Chapter %0a%3c 55 of this Book, that he flourished before the burning of the Temple of %0a%3c Diana at Ephesus, b.c. 356. He is frequently mentioned in the classical %0a%3c writers. See also B. vii. c. 39. %0a%3c %0a%3c 56 He includes, probably, under this name both Asia Minor and Syria. %0a%3c Bee a similar passage in Livy, B. xxxix. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 136 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c pliny's natural histoet. [Book XXXIII. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c find that Lucius Scipio, in his triumphal procession, exhibited %0a%3c one thousand four hundred pounds' weight of chased silver, %0a%3c with golden vessels, the weight of which amounted to one %0a%3c thousand five hundred pounds. This 57 took place in the year %0a%3c from the foundation of the City, 565. But that which in- %0a%3c flicted a still more severe blow upon the Roman morals, was %0a%3c the legacy of Asia, 58 which King Attalus 59 left to the state at %0a%3c his decease, a legacy which was even more disadvantageous %0a%3c than the victory of Scipio, 60 in its results. For, upon this %0a%3c occasion, all scruple was entirely removed, by the eagerness %0a%3c which existed at Home, for making purchases at the auction %0a%3c of the king's effects. This took place in the year of the City, %0a%3c 622, the people having learned, during the fifty-seven years %0a%3c that had intervened, not only to admire, but to covet even, %0a%3c the opulence of foreign nations. The tastes of the Roman %0a%3c people had received, too, an immense impulse from the con- %0a%3c quest of Achaia, 61 which, during this interval, in the year of %0a%3c the City, 608, that nothing might be wanting, had introduced %0a%3c both statues and pictures. The same epoch, too, that saw the %0a%3c birth of luxury, witnessed the downfall of Carthage ; so that, %0a%3c by a fatal coincidence, the lloman people, at the same mo- %0a%3c ment, both acquired a taste for vice and obtained a license %0a%3c for gratifying it. %0a%3c %0a%3c Some, too, of the ancients sought to recommend themselves %0a%3c by this love of excess ; for Caius Marius, after his victory over %0a%3c the Cimbri, drank from a cantharus, 62 it is said, in imitation %0a%3c of Father Liber f Marius, that ploughman 64 of Arpinum, a %0a%3c general who had risen from the ranks ! 65 %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 54.

The greatest %0a%3c renown, however, has been acquired by Mentor, of whom %0a%3c mention has been made already. 74 Four pairs [of vases] were %0a%3c all that were ever 75 made by him ; and at the present day, not %0a%3c one of these, it is said, is any longer in existence, owing to %0a%3c the conflagrations of the Temple of Diana at Ephesus and of %0a%3c that in the Capitol. 76 Varro informs us in his writings that he %0a%3c also was in possession of a bronze statue, the work of this %0a%3c artist. Next to Mentor, the most admired artists were Acra- %0a%3c %0a%3c 73 " Videret hinc dona fortium fieri, aut in haec frangi." %0a%3c %0a%3c 74 In B. vii. c. 39, and in Chapter 53 of this Book. %0a%3c %0a%3c 75 " Quatuor paria ab eo omnino facta sunt." Sillig, in his Dictionary %0a%3c of Ancient Artists, finds a difficulty in this passage. "The term 'om- %0a%3c nino ' seems to imply that the productions in question, all of which perished, %0a%3c were the only works executed by this artist ; but we find several passages %0a%3c of ancient writers, in which vases, &c. engraved by Mentor, are mentioned %0a%3c as extant. Thus, then, we must conclude, either that the term ' omnino ' %0a%3c should be understood in the sense of ' chiefly,' ' pre-eminently/ or that the %0a%3c individuals claiming to possess works of Mentor, were themselves misin- %0a%3c formed, or endeavoured to deceive others." If, however, we look at the %0a%3c word "paria " in a strictly technical sense, the difficulty will probably he %0a%3c removed. Pliny's meaning seems to be that Mentor made four pairs and %0a%3c no more, of some peculiar kind of vessel probably, and that all these %0a%3c pairs were now lost.

Sil is, properly speak- %0a%3c ing, a sort of slime. 2 The best kind is that known as Attic %0a%3c sil ; the price of which is two denarii per pound. The next best %0a%3c kind is the marbled 3 sil, the price of which is half that of the %0a%3c Attic kind. A third sort is the compressed sil, known to some %0a%3c persons as Scyric sil, it coming from the Isle of Scyros. %0a%3c Then, too, there is the sil of Achaia, which painters make use %0a%3c of for shadow-painting, and the price of which is two sesterces %0a%3c per pound. At a price of two asses less per pound, is sold the %0a%3c %0a%3c 93 For the murder of his mother Clytsmnestra. %0a%3c %0a%3c 94 Nothing is known of this artist. 95 F r0 m Troy. %0a%3c %0a%3c 96 " Coquos," literally, "cooks." w « Cooks in miniature." %0a%3c %0a%3c 98 By the process of moulding, probably. %0a%3c %0a%3c 99 " Crustarius."

This last kind, as well as %0a%3c the Attic sil, is used for painting strong lights : but the mar- %0a%3c bled sil only is employed for colouring compartitions, 5 the %0a%3c marble in it offering a resistance to the natural acridity of the %0a%3c lime. This last kind is extracted also from some mountains %0a%3c twenty miles distant from the City. When thus extracted, %0a%3c it is submitted to the action of fire ; in which form it is adul- %0a%3c terated by some, and 6old for compressed sil. That it has been %0a%3c burnt, however, and adulterated, may be very easily detected by %0a%3c its acridity, and the fact that it very soon crumbles into dust. %0a%3c %0a%3c Polygnotus 6 and Micon 7 were the first to employ sil in %0a%3c painting, but that of Attica solely. The succeeding age used %0a%3c this last kind for strong lights only, and employed the Scyric %0a%3c and Lydian kinds for shadow painting. The Lydian sil used %0a%3c to be bought at Sardes ; but at the present day we hear %0a%3c nothing of it. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 57. (13.) — CiERTJLEUM. %0a%3c %0a%3c Cseruleum 8 is a kind of sand.

In other respects, the mode of preparing it is Bimilar %0a%3c to that of chrysocolla. From cseruleum, too, is prepared the %0a%3c substance known as " lomentum," 13 it being washed and %0a%3c ground for the purpose. Lomentum is of a paler tint than %0a%3c caoruleum ; the price of it is ten denarii per pound, and that %0a%3c of cseruleum but eight. Ca3ruleum is used upon a surface %0a%3c of clay, for upon lime it will not hold. A more recent %0a%3c invention is the Vestorian 11 cseruleum, so called from the %0a%3c person who first manufactured it : it is prepared from the finer %0a%3c parts of Egyptian cseruleum, and the price of it is eleven %0a%3c denarii per pound. That of Puteoli is used in a similar %0a%3c manner, 15 as also for windows : 16 it is known as " cylon." %0a%3c %0a%3c " cseruleum." " Pliny clearly adds to it an artificial colour, which in my %0a%3c opinion was made in the same manner as our lake ; for he speaks of an %0a%3c earth, which when boiled with plants, acquired their blue colour." — Hist. %0a%3c Inv., Vol. II. p. 4S0. %0a%3c %0a%3c 11 Supposed by Hardouin to have been " glastum " or " woad," the Isatis %0a%3c tinctoria of Linnaeus, mentioned in B. xxii. c. 2. %0a%3c %0a%3c 12 " In sua coquitur herba." %0a%3c %0a%3c 13 A blue powder ; see Chapter 27 of this Book.

The author, it is true, where he treats of mineral pig- %0a%3c ments, seems to speak of a blue sand which produced different shades of %0a%3c blue paint, according as it was pounded coarser or finer. The palest powder %0a%3c was called lomentum, and this Lehmann considers as our powder-blue. I %0a%3c am, however, fully convinced that the cyanus of Theophrastus, the caruleum %0a%3c of Pliny, and the chrysocolla (see Chapter 26), were the blue copper earth %0a%3c already mentioned, whicb may have been mixed and blended together.'' — %0a%3c Hist.

Vestorius %0a%3c who was also a money-lender and a friend of Atticus, and with whom %0a%3c Cicero had monetary transactions.

" The expression %0a%3c here, usus ad fenestras, has been misapplied by Lehmann, as a strong proof %0a%3c of his assertion; for he explained it as if Pliny had said that a blue pig- %0a%3c ment was used for painting window-frames ; but glass windows were at %0a%3c that time unknown.

Painters %0a%3c make use of it for incisures, or in other words, the division of %0a%3c shadows from light.

TWO REMEDIES DERIVED FROM OERTTLEUM. %0a%3c %0a%3c Caeruleum has the medicinal property of acting as a deter- %0a%3c gent upon ulcers. Hence it is, that it is used as an ingredient %0a%3c in plasters, as also in cauteries. As to sil, it is pounded with %0a%3c the greatest difficulty : viewed as a medicament, it is slightly %0a%3c mordent and astringent, and fills up the cavities left by ulcers. %0a%3c To make it the more serviceable, it is burnt in earthen %0a%3c vessels. %0a%3c %0a%3c The prices of things, which I have in different places %0a%3c annexed, vary, I am well aware, according to the locality, and %0a%3c experience a change almost every year: variations dependent %0a%3c upon the opportunities afforded for navigation, and the terms %0a%3c upon which the merchant may have purchased the article. It %0a%3c may so happen, too, that some wealthy dealer has engrossed %0a%3c the market, and so enhanced the price : for I am by no means %0a%3c forgetful of the case of Demetrius, who in the reign of the %0a%3c Emperor Nero was accused before the consuls by the whole %0a%3c community of the Seplasia. 21 Still, however, I have thought %0a%3c %0a%3c passage to the light, as it soon decayed and lost its colour.
