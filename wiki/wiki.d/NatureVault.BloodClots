I worked with making fibrin from fibrinogen and thrombin when I worked at an NIH lab under Fauci and I can verify that fibrin is a whitish to pinkish mass so it makes sense to me that it is that.  First It is likely from streptococcus aureus coagulase.  As soon as I learned it was fibrin I looked at bacteria that can cause fibrin to be made.  [[S aureus]] is well know to cause blood clots.  Next we need to know, why after covid or the vaccine?  Well firstly we know that s aureus is elevated by about 2x due to spike protein.  So that is some good circumstantial evidence. N-protein from covid-19 is homologous (the same) as s aureus coagulase.  This could mean that this is how covid enhances s aureus, or mimics it.  Spike protein can interact with PF4 platelet factor 4 causing clots. Also what supports this theory is these fibrin clots have been found rarely in the past, but they are always in the venous system not arteries, as per the documentary and used to be very rare, now almost everyone has them.  So something from the biology that syncs with this is that spike protein causes the bacteria to leave its biofilm.  So what this means is the bacteria can translocate, from the venous system into the arterial system.  This is why we are seeing this in the arteries now.  S aureus would reside in the fibrin clot itself if this theory is correct.  We also see that this fibrin clot causes normal blood clots to form on itself.  This is consistent with s aureus using the fibrin clot as a sort of home base and further clotting the blood from inside it's protective shelter by releasing coagulase.%0a%0aPredictions:%0a%0aIf this theory is true, I would expect that the fresh fibrin clots could be cultured in a tissue culture method on s aureus (coagulase +) plates and we should see s aureus grow on the plate.  Barring that, we should be able to section the fibrin clots and see evidence of s aureus bacteria via electron microscope.  If no evidence of bacteria is found, it could be from N-protein on covid-19 that mimics the action of s aureus.%0a%0aWhat we don't know:%0a%0aWe don't know if this is from natural covid-19 infection or the vaccine, but we can confidently say it could be caused by either or both.
