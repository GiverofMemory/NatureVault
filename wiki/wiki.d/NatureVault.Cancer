text=(:nogroupheader:)%0aCancer is a complex reaction of the body to an infection of a particular type of bacteria or complex of bacteria.  Fungus produces alfatoxin which is one of the most potent promotors of cancer known.  Also viruses are known to mutate DNA and cause certain types of cancer.  Knowing all this, I still believe that cancer boils down to a single base factor and proximal cause. Bacteria including [[Serratia]], [[Listeria]], or [[h pylori]].%0a%0aIn addition to cancer these principles laid out below can fight other inflammatory abcess like issues like swollen [[adenoids]] and also [[tooth root abscess]] among other problems.%0a%0a[[Parasite]] [[bacteria]] [[virus]] all can be responsible including [[strongyloides]] [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5233816/|#]]%0a%0a!!Serratia%0a%0aOne of the primary cancer causing bacteria is Serratia in most cases, especially in malignant cancers.  Other bacteria can also be involved.  Serratia produces DNAse which is very likely what causes mutations in DNA in the cancer area.  Serratia may or may not cause some pain and likely depends on other bacteria involved.  Pressing on the infected location if palpable will likely always cause some discomfort.  Serratia very often creates redness and probably can only be seen if the infection is on the skin but perhaps there could be lighting technology that can look for it elsewhere.%0a%0a[[https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/1097-0142(197001)25:1%3c199::AID-CNCR2820250128>3.0.CO;2-4 | Serratia linked to cancer in genitourinary tract]].  Thus lemongrass for these.%0a%0a[[https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/jmm/10.1099/00222615-13-2-333?crawler=true&mimetype=application/pdf | Urine of lymphoma and leukemia patients]]%0a%0a!!Listeria%0a[[Listeria]] is likely the most common root cause of cancer.%0a%0aCreates phospholipase c [[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2561039/|#]] which degrades lecithin and other choline containing molecules causing inflammation.%0a%0a!!H Pylori [[#hpylori]]%0a[[H pylori]] is a common cause of cancer both in the stomach and elsewhere.%0a%0a!!Treatments%0aEffective treatments for cancer include things that fight the bacterial cause directly or coinfection bacteria or lower [[blood sugar]] or improve blood [[clotting]] ability or improve [[prostaglandin]] balance.%0a%0a!!!Tubulin%0aAnti-tubulin drugs [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_and_development_of_tubulin_inhibitors|#]].%0a%0a[[Melatonin]] affects [[tubulin]] [[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780080264004500372|#]].%0a!!!Fighting Serratia%0aOne of the best ways to fight Serratia bacteria is with [[lemongrass]] or citrus [[essential oil]].  These oils are very effective at killing the bacteria.  Lemongrass especially can kill many other types of bacteria as well.  Serratia also seems to be fought with [[triterpenoid saponin]] as well.  These [[saponin]] are not very bioavailable but taking them with [[steroidal saponin]] makes them fully [[bioavailability | bioavailable]].%0a%0a!!!Fighting H pylori%0aSee [[H pylori]]%0a%0a!!!Fighting Listeria%0aSee [[Listeria]]%0a%0a!!!Lowering [[blood sugar]]%0aEven fighting Serratia directly, lowering blood sugar is an absolute must.  This is likely because Serratia is very dependent on sugar and also phospholipids.  Of course not eating foods with added sugar is very important.  Other things that lower blood sugar like [[Ellagic acid]] are invaluable.%0a%0a[[Retinoids]] like Retinol (animal form vitamin A) are essential for healthy blood sugar response and immune system boosting.  Around half of all people cannot convert beta-carotene into retinol efficiently.  Cod liver oil is a good source or retinol supplements.%0a%0a!!!Improving Blood [[Clotting]]%0aCancer seems totally dependent on inadequate blood clotting ability.  This could be from the serratia itself or a coinfection bacteria like streptococcus which is know to interfere with clotting.  Certain treatments like taking [[vitamin K]] (or eating lots of [[kale]]) and [[Ellagic acid]]%0aAre some of the most effective cancer fighters known.%0a%0a!!!Anti-inflammatories%0aAnti-inflammatory drugs known to treat cancer [[https://www.cancerhealth.com/article/antiinflammatory-drug-may-fight-cancer-heart-disease-1|#]].
