[[#chap1]]%0a%0aI have now given at considerable length an account of the %0anature of metals, which constitute our wealth, and of the %0asubstances that are derived from them ; so connecting my %0avarious subjects, as, at the same time, to describe an immense %0anumber of medicinal compositions which they furnish, the %0amysteries 1 thrown upon them by the druggists, and the tedious %0aminutiaj of the arts of chasing, 2 and statuary, 3 and of dyeing. 4 %0aIt remains for me to describe the various kinds of earths and %0astones ; a still more extensive series of subjects, each of which %0ahas been treated of, by the Greeks more particularly, in a great %0anumber of volumes. For my own part, I propose to employ a %0adue degree of brevity, at the same time omitting nothing that %0ais necessary or that is a product of Nature. %0a%0aI shall begin then with what still remains to be said with %0areference to painting, an art which was formerly illustrious, %0awhen it was held in esteem both by kings and peoples, and %0aennobling those whom it deigned to transmit to posterity. %0aBut at the present da) r , it is completely banished in favour %0aof marble, and even gold. For not only are whole walls now %0acovered with marble, but the marble itself is carved out or %0aelse marqueted so as to represent objects and animals of %0avarious kinds. No longer now are we satisfied with formal %0acompartitions of marble, or with slabs extended like so many %0amountains in our chambers, but we must begin to paint the %0avery stone itself! This art was invented in the reign of %0aClaudius, but it was in the time of Nero that we discovered the %0amethod of inserting in marble spots that do not belong to it, %0a%0a1 " Officinarum tenebrae ;" probably in reference to the ignorance dis- %0aplayed by the compounders of medicines, as pointed out in B. xxxiii. c. 38, %0aand in B. xxxiv. c. 25. — B. 9 See B. xxxiii. c. 55. %0a%0as See B. xxxiv. c. 9. 4 See B. xxxiii. c. 36. %0a%0a%0a%0a224 %0a%0a%0a%0apliht's NATURAL HISTOET. %0a%0a%0a%0a[Book XXXV. %0a%0a%0a%0aand so varying its uniformity ; and this, for the purpose of %0arepresenting the marble of Numidia 5 variegated with ovals, %0aand that of Synnada 6 veined with purple; just, in fact, as %0aluxury might have willed that Nature should produce them. %0aSuch are our resources when the quarries fail us, and luxury %0aceases not to busy itself, in order that as much as possible may %0abe lost whenever a conflagration happens. %0a%0a!!CHAP. 2. (2.) — THE HONOUR ATTACHED TO PORTRAIT8. [[#chap2]]%0a%0aCorrect portraits of individuals were formerly transmitted to %0afuture ages by painting ; but this has now completely fallen into %0adesuetude. Brazen shields are now set up, and silver faces, with %0aonly some obscure traces of the countenance : 7 the very heads, %0atoo, of statues are changed, 8 a thing that has given rise before %0anow to many a current sarcastic line ; so true it is that people %0aprefer showing off the valuable material, to having a faithful %0alikeness. And yet, at the same time, we tapestry the walls of %0aour galleries with old pictures, and we prize the portraits of %0astrangers; while as to those made in honour of ourselves, we %0aesteem them only for the value of the material, for some heir to %0abreak up and melt, and so forestall the noose and slip-knot of %0athe thief. 9 Thus it is that we possess the portraits of no %0aliving individuals, and leave behind us the pictures of our %0awealth, not of our persons. %0a%0aAnd yet the very same persons adorn the palaestra and the %0aanointing-room 10 with portraits of athletes, and both hang %0aup in their chamber and carry about them a likeness of %0aEpicurus. 11 On the twentieth day of each moon they cele- %0abrate his birthday 11 * by a sacrifice, and keep his festival, %0aknown as the "leas," 12 every month : and these too, people who %0a%0a5 See B. xxxvi. c. 8. 6 See B. v. c. 29. %0a%0a7 " Surdo figuravum discrimine." %0a%0a8 We are informed by Suetonius, that this practice existed in the time %0aof Tiberius.— B.

The pedi- %0agree, too, of the individual was traced in lines upon each of %0athese coloured portraits. Their muniment-rooms, 16 too, were %0afilled with archives and memoirs, stating what each had done %0awhen holding the magistracy. On the outside, again, of their %0ahouses, and around the thresholds of their doors, were placed %0aother statues of those mighty spirits, in the spoils of the enemy %0athere affixed, memorials which a purchaser even was not %0aallowed to displace ; 60 that the very house continued to %0atriumph even after it had changed its master. A powerful %0astimulus to emulation this, when the walls each day re- %0aproached an uiiwarlike owner for having thus intruded upon %0athe triumphs of another ! There is still extant an address by %0athe orator Messala, full of indignation, in which he forbids %0athat there should be inserted among the images of his family %0aany of those of the stranger race of the Lsevini. 17 It was the %0asame feeling, too, that extorted from old Messala those com- %0apilations of his "On the Families of Rome;" when, upon %0apassing through the hall of Scipio Pomponianus, 18 he observed %0athat, in consequence of a testamentary adoption, the Salvittos 19 %0a%0a13 In obedience to the maxim of Epicurus, Ad8t fiiwcas — " Live in ob- %0ascurity." 14 See B. xxi. c. 49, and Note 4, p. 346. %0a%0a15 This appears to have been the usual practice at the funerals of dis- %0atinguished personages among the Romans : it is referred to by Tacitus, %0aAnn.

But the Messalas must pardon me if I remark, %0athat to lay a claim, though an untruthful one, to the statues %0aof illustrious men, shows some love for their virtues, and is %0amuch more honourable than to have such a character as to %0amerit that no one should wish to claim them. %0a%0aThere is a new invention too, which we must not omit to %0anotice. Not only do we consecrate in our libraries, in gold %0aor silver, or at all events, in bronze, those whose immortal %0aspirits bold converse with us in those places, but we even go %0aso far as to reproduce the ideal of features, all remembrance of %0awhich has ceased to exist ; and our regrets give existence to %0alikenesses that have not been transmitted to us, as in the case %0aof Homer, for example. 20 And indeed, it is my opinion, that %0anothing can be a greater proof of having achieved success in %0alife, than a lasting desire on the part of one's fellow-men, to %0aknow what one's features were. This practice of grouping %0aportraits was first introduced at Rome by Asinius Pollio, %0awho was also the first to establish a public library, and so %0amake the works of genius the property of the public. %0a"Whether the kings of Alexandria and of Pergamus, who had %0aso energetically rivalled each other in forming libraries, had %0apreviously introduced this practice, I cannot so easily say. %0a%0aThat a strong passion for portraits formerly existed, is %0aattested both by Atticus, the friend of Cicero, who wrote a %0awork on this subject, 21 and by M. Varro, who conceived the %0avery liberal idea of inserting, by some means 23 or other, in his %0anumerous volumes, the portraits of seven hundred individuals ; %0aas he could not bear the idea that all traces of their features %0ashould be lost, or that the lapse of centuries should get the %0a%0aSuetonius speaks in very derogatory terms of a member of this family, who %0aaccompanied Julius Caesar in his Spanish campaign against the Pompeian %0a%0atLe binary portrait of %0a- 1 Hardoum supposes that this work was written by Cicero and that he %0anamed it after his friend Atticus; but, as Delafosse remark L it is c ear %0afrom the context that it was the work of Atticus — B ' 1 Ciear %0a%0a» M.

Thus was he the inventor of a benefit to %0ahis fellow-men, that might have been envied by the gods %0athemselves; for not only did he confer upon them immortality, %0abut he transmitted them, too, to all parts of the earth ; so that %0aeverywhere it might be possible for them to be present, and. %0afor each to occupy his niche. This service, too, Varro con- %0aferred upon persons who were no members of his own family. %0a%0a!!CHAP. 3. (3.) — WHEN SHIELDS WERE FIRST INVENTED WITH PORTRAITS UPON THEM ; AND WHEN THEY WERE FIRST ERECTED IN PUBLIC. [[#chap3]]%0a%0aSo far as I can learn, Appius Claudius, who was consul %0awith P. Servilius, in the year of the City, 259, was the first to %0adedicate shields 23 in honour of his own family in a sacred or %0apublic place. 24 For he placed representations of his ancestors %0ain the Temple of Bellona, and desired that they might be %0aerected in an elevated spot, so as to be seen, and the inscrip- %0ations reciting their honours read. A truly graceful device ; %0amore particularly when a multitude of children, represented %0aby so many tiny figures, displays those germs, as it were, %0awhich are destined to continue the line : shields such as these, %0ano one can look at without a feeling of pleasure and lively %0ainterest. %0a%0a!!CHAP. 4. — WHEN THESE SHIELDS WERE FIRST PLACED IN PRIVATE HOUSES. [[#chap4]]%0a%0aMore recently, M. iEmilius, who was consul 52 with Quintus %0aLutatius, not only erected these shields in the -3£milian %0aBasilica, 26 but in his own house as well ; in doing which %0ahe followed a truly warlike example. For, in fact, these %0aportraits were represented on bucklers, similar to those used %0ain the Trojan "War ; 27 and hence it is that these shields re- %0aceived their present name of " clypei," and not, as the perverse %0a%0a23 " Clypei." These were shields or escutcheons of metal, with the fea- %0atures of the deceased person represented either in painting or in relief. %0a%0a24 Hardouin informs us that there are some Greek inscriptions given by %0aGruter, p. 441, and p. 476, from which it appears that public festivals %0awere celebrated on occasions of this kind. — B. %0a%0a25 a.u.c. 671.— B.

The Carthaginians used to make both their bucklers and their %0aportraits of gold, and to carry them with them in the camp : at %0aall events, Marcius, the avenger of the Scipios 29 in Spain, found %0aone of this kind on capturing the camp of Hasdrubal, and it %0awas this same buckler that remained suspended over the gate of %0athe Capitoline Temple until the time when it was first burnt. 30 %0aIndeed, in the days of our ancestors, so assured was the safety %0aof these shields, that it has been a subject of remark, that in %0athe consulship of L. Manlius and Q. Fulvius, in the year of %0athe City, 575, M. Aufidius, who had given security for the %0asafety of the Capitol, informed the senate that the bucklers %0athere which for some lustra 31 had been assessed as copper, %0awere in reality made of silver. %0a%0a!!CHAP 5.

[[#chap5]]%0a%0a"We have no certain knowledge as to the commencement of %0athe art of painting, nor does this enquiry fall under our con- %0asideration. The Egyptians assert that it was invented among %0athemselves, six thousand years before it passed into Greece ; a %0avain boast, it is very evident. 32 As to the Greeks, some say %0athat it was invented at Sicyon, others at Corinth ; but they %0aall agree that it originated in tracing lines round the human %0ashadow. 33 The first stage of the art, they say, was this, the %0a%0a28 He implies that the word is derived from the Greek yXixptiv, " to %0acarve" or " emboss," and not from the old Latin " cluo," " to be famous." %0aAjasson suggests the Greek khXvtttu),' 1 to cover." %0a%0a29 Cneius and Publius Scipio, who had been slain by Hasdrubal.— B. %0aAs to L.

The first %0awho practised this line-drawing were Aridices, the Corinthian, %0aand Telephanes, the Sicyonian, artists who, without making %0ause of any colours, shaded the interior of the outline by %0adrawing lines ; 3G hence, it was the custom with them to add to %0athe picture the name of the person represented. Ecphantus, %0athe Corinthian, was the first to employ colours upon these %0apictures, made, it is said, of broken earthenware, reduced to %0apowder. "We shall show on a future 37 occasion, that it was a %0adifferent artist of the same name, who, according to Cornelius %0aNepos, came to Italy with Demaratus, the father of the Roman %0aking, Tarquinius Priscus, on his flight from Corinth to escape %0athe violence of the tyrant Cypselus. %0a%0a!!CHAP. 6. — THK ANTIQUITY OF PAINTING IN ITALY. [[#chap6]]%0a%0aBut already, in fact, had the art of painting been perfectly %0adeveloped in Italy. 38 At all events, there are extant in the %0atemples at Ardea, at this day, paintings of greater antiquity %0athan Rome itself ; in which, in my opinion, nothing is more %0amarvellous, than that they should have remained so long %0aunprotected by a roof, and yet preserving their freshness. 39 At %0aLanuvium, too, it is the same, where we see an Atalanta and a %0aHelena, without drapery, close together, and painted by the %0a%0ature, consisted in tracing the shadow of a human head or some other ob- %0aject on the wall, the interior being filled up with one uniform shade of %0acolour. — B. %0a%0a34 From the Greek novoxp&paTov, " single colouring."— B. %0a%0a35 He is mentioned also by Athenagoras, Strabo, and Athenasus. %0a%0a36 Called " graphis," by the Greeks, and somewhat similar, probably, to %0aour pen and ink drawings. %0a%0a37 In Chapter 43 of this Book.— B. %0a%0a38 Ajasson remarks, that a great number of paintings have been lately %0adiscovered in the Etruscan tombs, in a very perfect state, and probably of %0avery high antiquity. — B. %0a%0a39 There would appear to be still considerable uncertainty respecting %0athe nature of the materials employed by the ancients, and the manner of %0aapplying them, by which they produced these durable paintings ; a %0abranch of the art which has not been attained in equal perfection by the %0amodems. — B. %0a%0a%0a%0a230 %0a%0a%0a%0aplint's natural history. %0a%0a%0a%0a[Book XXXV. %0a%0a%0a%0asame artist. They are both of the greatest beauty, the former %0abeing evidently the figure of a virgin, and the)^ still remain %0auninjured, though the temple is in ruins.

Whoever carefully examines them, will be forced %0ato admit that no art has arrived more speedily at perfec- %0ation, seeing that it evidently was not in existence at the time %0aof the Trojan War. 43 %0a%0a!!CHAT. 7. (4.) — ROMAN PAINTERS. [[#chap7]]%0a%0aAmong the Romans, too, this art very soon rose into esteem, %0afor it was from it that the Fabii, a most illustrious family, de- %0arived their surname of " Pictor ;" indeed the first of the family %0awho bore it, himself painted the Temple of Salus, 43 in the year %0aof the City, 450 ; a work which lasted to our own times, but was %0adestroyed when the temple was burnt, in the reign of Claudius. %0aNext in celebrity were the paintings of the poet Pacuvius, in %0athe Temple of Hercules, situate in the Cattle Market : 44 he was %0aa son of the sister of Ennius, and the fame of the art was %0aenhanced at Rome by the success of the artist on the stage. %0aAfter this period, the art was no longer practised by men of %0arank ; unless, indeed, we would make reference to Turpilius, %0ain our own times, a native of Venetia, and of equestrian rank, %0aseveral of whose beautiful works are still in existence at %0aVerona. He painted, too, with his left hand, a thing never %0aknown to have been done by any one before. 44 * %0a%0aTitidius Labeo, a person of praetorian rank, who had been %0aformerly proconsul of the province of Gallia Narbonensis, and %0awho lately died at a very advanced age, used to pride himself %0aupon the little pictures which he executed, but it only caused %0ahim to be ridiculed and sneered at. I must not omit, too, to %0amention a celebrated consultation upon the subject of paint- %0aing, which was held by some persons of the highest rank. %0a%0a4° Caligula. 4i s ee c 8> %0a%0a43 We have already remarked that painting was practised very exten- %0asively by the Egyptians, probably long before the period of the Trojan %0awar. — B. %0a%0a43 Or " Health."

Pedius, 45 who had been honoured with the consulship and a %0atriumph, and who had been named by the Dictator Caesar as %0aco-heir with Augustus, had a grandson, who being dumb from %0ahis birth, the orator Messala, to whose family his grandmother %0abelonged, recommended that he should be brought up as a %0apainter, a proposal which was also approved of by the late %0aEmperor Augustus. He died, however, in his youth, after %0ahaving made great progress in the art. But the high estima- %0ation in which painting came to be held at Rome, was prin- %0acipally due, in my opinion, to M. Valerius Maximus Messala, %0awho, in the year of the City, 490, was the first to exhibit a %0apainting to the public ; a picture, namely, of the battle in %0awhich he had defeated the Carthaginians and Hiero in Sicily, %0aupon one side of the Curia Hostilia." 16 The same thing was done, %0atoo, by L. Scipio, 47 who placed in the Capitol a painting of the %0avictory which he had gained in Asia ; but his brother Africanus, %0ait is said, was offended at it, and not without reason, for his %0ason had been taken prisoner in the battle. 48 Lucius Hostilius %0aMancinus, 49 too, who had been the first to enter Carthage at the %0afinal attack, gave a very similar offence to iEmilianus, 49 * by %0aexposing in the Forum a painting of that city and the attack %0aupon it, he himself standing near the picture, and describing %0ato the spectators the various details of the siege ; a piece of %0acomplaisance which secured him the consulship at the ensuing %0aComitia. %0a%0aThe stage, too, which was erected for the games celebrated %0aby Claudius Pulcher, 80 brought the art of painting into great %0aadmiration, it being observed that the ravens were so de- %0aceived by the resemblance, as to light upon the decorations %0awhich were painted in imitation of tiles. %0a%0a45 Q.

[[#chap8]]%0a%0aThe high estimation in which the paintings of foreigners were %0aheld at Rome commenced with Lucius Mummius, who, from %0ahis victories, acquired the surname of " Achaicus." For upon %0athe sale of the spoil on that occasion, King Attalus having pur- %0achased, at the price of six thousand denarii, a painting of Fa- %0ather Liber by Aristides, 51 Mummius, feeling surprised at the %0aprice, and suspecting that there might be some merit in it of %0awhich he himself was unaware, 52 in spite of the complaints of %0aAttalus, broke off the bargain, and had the picture placed in %0athe Temple of Ceres ; 53 the first instance, I conceive, of a foreign %0apainting being publicly exhibited at Rome. %0a%0aAfter this, I find, it became a common practice to exhibit %0aforeign pictures in the Forum ; for it was to this circumstance %0athat we are indebted for a joke of the orator Crassus. While %0apleading below the Old Shops, 64 he was interrupted by a witness %0awho had been summoned, with the question, " Tell me then, %0aCrassus, what do you take me to be ?

The price of the best is twelve denarii per %0apound; it is used both for painting with the brush, and for %0acolouring wood. The kind which comes from Africa sells at %0aeight asses per pound ; the name given to it is " cicerculum." 18 %0aThat 17 which is of the deepest red is the most in use for %0acolouring compartitions. The sinopis known as the dull 18 %0akind, being of a very tawny complexion, sells also at the price %0aof eight asses per pound ; it is used principally for the lower 19 %0aparts of compartitions. %0a%0aUsed medicinally, sinopis is of a soothing nature, and is em- %0aployed as an ingredient in plasters and emollient poultices. %0aIt admits of being easily used, whether in the form of a dry %0aor of a liquid composition, for the cure of ulcers situate in the %0ahumid parts of the body, the mouth and the rectum, for in- %0astance. Used as an injection, it arrests looseness of the bowels, %0aand, taken in doses of one denarius, it acts as a check upon %0afemale discharges.

[[#chap22]]%0a%0aAccording to Juba, sandarach and ochra are both of them %0aproductions of the island of Topazus, 43 in the Red Sea ; but %0aneither of them are imported to us from that place. The %0a%0a35 Ceruse, white lead, or carbonate of lead, is prepared in much the same %0amanner at the present day. Ajasson is of opinion that the native pigment %0adiscovered on the lands of Theodotus, was native carbonate of lead, the %0acrystals of which are found accompanied by quartz. %0a%0a36 " Burnt" ceruse. This was, in fact, one of the varieties of " minium," %0ared oxide of lead, our red lead. Vitruvius and Dioscorides call it " san- %0adaraca," differing somewhat from that of Pliny. 37 In Chapter 10. %0a%0a39 See B. xxxiii. cc. 56, 57. %0a%0a39 It was possibly owing to this that the colour known as " umber" re- %0aceived its name, and not from Ombria, in Italy. Ajasson says that sha- %0adows cannot be successfully made without the use of transparent colours, %0aand that red and the several browns are remarkably transparent. %0a%0a40 See B. iv. c. 21. 41 As to both of these artists, see Chapter 36. %0a« To the chest. 43 See B. vi. c. 34, and B. xxxvii. c. 32. %0a%0a%0a%0a240 %0a%0a%0a%0aplint's NATURAL HISTOET.

The most esteemed black, 81 however, that is made %0ain this way, is prepared from the wood of the torch-pine. %0a%0aIt is adulterated by mixing it with the ordinary soot from %0afurnaces and baths, a substance which is also employed for the %0apurpose of writing. Others, again, calcine dried wine-lees, and %0aassure us that if the wine was originally of good quality from %0awhich the colour is made, it will bear comparison with that of %0aindicum. 32 Polygnotus and Micon, the most celebrated painters %0aof Athens, made their black from grape-husks, and called it %0a" tryginon.

It may possi- %0ably mean " charred bones tainted with dirt." This would make an in- %0aferior ivory -black. The earth before-mentioned is considered by Ajasson %0ato be a deuto-sulphate of copper, a solution of which, in gallic acid, is %0astill used for dyeing black.

[[#chap26]]%0a%0aAmong the remaining colours which, as already stated, 59 %0aowing to their dearness are furnished by the employer, pur- %0apurissum holds the highest rank. For the purpose of prepar- %0aing it, argcntaria or silver chalk 57 is dyed along with purple 58 %0acloth, it imbibing the colour more speedily than the wool. The %0abest of all is that which, being thrown the very first into the %0aboiling cauldron, becomes saturated with the dye in its primi- %0ative state. The next best in quality is that which has been %0aput into the same liquor, after the first has been removed. %0aEach time that this is done, the quality becomes proportionally %0adeteriorated, owing, of course, to the comparative thinness %0aof the liquid. The reason that the purpurissum of Puteoli %0ais more highly esteemed than that of Tyre, Gaetulia, or Laconia, %0aplaces which produce the most precious kinds of purple, is thu %0afact that it combines more readily with hysginum, 69 and that %0ait is made to absorb the colouring liquid of madder. The %0aworst purpurissum is that of Lanuvium. 60 %0a%0aThe price of purpurissum is from one to thirty denarii per %0apound. Persons who use it in painting, place a coat of sandyx %0abeneath ; a layer on which of purpurissum with glair of egg, %0aproduces all the brilliant tints of minium. If, on the other %0ahand, it is their object to make a purple, they lay a coat of %0acaeruleum 01 beneath, and purpurissum, with egg, 62 upon it. %0a%0a!!CHAP. 27. INDICXfM.

(7.) WHICn COLOURS DO NOT ADMIT OF BEING LAID ON A WET COATING. [[#chap31]]%0a%0aThose among the colours which require a dry, cretaceous, %0acoating, 74 and refuse to adhere to a wet surface, are purpurissum, %0aindicum, caeruleum, 75 melinum, orpiment, appianum, and %0aceruse. Wax, too, is stained with all these colouring substances %0afor encaustic painting ; 76 a process which does not admit of %0a%0a70 So called, probably, eitber from the place where it was made, or %0afrom the person who first discovered it. Some commentators have sug- %0agested that it should be " apian" green, meaning " parsley" colour. %0a%0a11 So called from "anulus," a "ring," as mentioned below. %0a%0a72 " Quo muliebres picturae illuminantur." The meaning of this pas- %0asage is obscure. It would seem almost to apply to paintings, but Beck- %0amann is of opinion that the meaning is, " This is the beautiful white with %0awhich the ladies paint or ornament themselves."— Hist. Inv. Vol. II. p. %0a261. Bohn's Edition. %0a%0a73 Beckmann suggests that it was so called from its being one of the %0asealing earths, " anulus" being the name of a signet ring.

" ' Cerce,' %0aor ' waxes,' was the ordinary term for painters' colours among the Bo- %0amans, but more especially encaustic colours, which were probably kept dry %0ain boxes, and the wet brush or pencil was rubbed upon them when colour %0awas required, or they were moistened by the artist previous to commencing %0awork. From the term ' eerie' it would appear that wax constituted the %0aprincipal ingredient in the colouring vehicle used ; but this does not ne- %0acessarily follow, and it is very improbable that it did ; there must have %0abeen a great portion of gum or resin in the colours, or they could not have %0ahardened. Wax was undoubtedly a most essential ingredient, since it %0aapparently prevents the colours from cracking. ' Cera therefore might %0aoriginally simply mean colours which contained wax, in contradistinction %0ato those which did not ; but was afterwards applied generally by the Ro- %0amans to the colours of painters." — Wornum, Smith's Diet.

As we go so far as to paint these vehicles of danger, no %0aone can be surprised if we paint our funeral piles as well, or %0ait' we have our gladiators conveyed in handsome carriages to %0athe scene of death, or, at all events, of carnage. When we %0aonly contemplate this extensive variety of colours, we cannot %0abut admire the ingenuity displayed by the men of former %0adays. %0a%0a!!CTIAP. 32. — WHAT COLOURS WERE USED BY THE ANCIENTS IN PAINTING. [[#chap32]]%0a%0aIt was with four colours only, 78 that Apelles, 79 Echion, %0aMelanthius, and Nicomachus, those most illustrous painters, %0aexecuted their immortal works ; melinum 80 for the white, Attic %0asil 81 for the yellow, Pontic sinopis for the red, and atramentum %0afor the black ; 82 and yet a single picture of theirs has sold before %0anow for the treasures of whole cities. But at the present da)-, %0awhen purple is employed for colouring walls even, and when %0aIndia sends to us the slime 83 of her rivers, and the corrupt blood %0aof her dragons 84 and her elephants, there is no such thing as a %0apicture of high quality produced. Everything, in fact, was su- %0aperior at a time when the resources of art were so much fewer %0athan they now are. Yes, so it is ; and the reason is, as we %0a%0a77 Called " Inceramenta navium," in Livy, B. xxviii. c. 45. See also %0aChapters 39 and 41 of this Book. %0a%0a78 Pliny here commits a mistake, which, may have arisen from an imper- %0afect recollection, as Sir. H. Davy has supposed, of a passage in Cicero %0a(Brutus, c. 18), which, however, quite contradicts the statement of Pliny. %0a" In painting, we admire in the works of Zeuxis, Polygnotus, Timanthes, %0aand those who \ised four colours only, the figure and the lineaments; but %0ain the works of Echion, Nicomachus, Protogenes, and Apelles, everything %0ais perfect." Indeed Pliny contradicts himself, for he speaks of two others %0acolours used by the earliest painters, the testa trita, or ground earthenware, %0ain Chapter 5 of this Book; and " cinnabaris," or vermilion, in B. xxxiii. %0ac. 36. Also, in Chapter 21 of this Book he speaks of Eretrian earth as %0ahaving been used by Nicomachus, and in Chapter 25 of ivory black as %0ahaving been invented by Apelles. %0a%0a79 These painters will all be noticed in Chapter 36. %0a%0aeo See Chapter 19 of this Book, 81 See B. xxxiii. c. 56. %0a%0a82 Blue is here excluded altogether, unless under the term " atramen- %0atum" we would include black and blue indicum, or in other words, Indian %0aink and indigo. 83 See Chapter 27 of this Book. %0a%0a81 In ailusion to Dragon's blood."

[[#chap33]]%0a%0aOne folly, too, of this age of ours, in reference to painting, I %0amust not omit. The Emperor Nero ordered a painting of him- %0aself to be executed upon canvass, of colossal proportions, one %0ahundred and twenty feet in height ; a thing till then un- %0aknown. 86 This picture was just completed when it was burnt %0aby lightning, with the greater part of the gardens of Haius, %0ain which it was exhibited. %0a%0aA freedman of the same prince, on the occasion of his ex- %0ahibiting a show of gladiators at Antium, had the public por- %0aticos hung, as everybody knows, with paintings, in which %0awere represented genuine portraits of the gladiators and all %0athe other assistants. Indeed, at this place, there has been a %0avery prevailing taste for paintings for many ages past. C. %0aTerentius Lucanus was the first who had combats of gladiators %0apainted for public exhibition : in honour of his grandfather, %0awho had adopted him, he provided thirty pairs of gladiators %0ain the Forum, for three consecutive days, and exhibited a %0apainting of their combats in the Grove of Diana. 87 %0a%0a!!CHAP. 34.

[[#chap34]]%0a%0aI shall now proceed to enumerate, as briefly as possible, the %0amore eminent among the painters ; it not being consistent with %0athe plan of this work to go into any great lengths of detail. %0aIt must suffice therefore, in some cases, to name the artist in a %0acursory manner only, and with reference to the account given of %0aothers ; with the exception, of course, of the more famous pro- %0a85 In Chapter 2 of this Book. %0a%0a66 From the construction of the passage, it is difficult to say whether he %0ameans to say that such colossal figures were till then unknown in paint- %0aing, or whether that the use of canvass in painting was till then unknown. %0aIf the latter is the meaning, it is not exactly correct, though it is probable %0athat the introduction of canvass for this purpose was comparatively late ; %0athere being no mention of its being employed by the Greek painters of the %0abest periods. %0a%0a„ 87 See B. iii. c.9, B. xiv. c. 3, and B. xvi. c. 91. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 34.] THE NAMES OF CELEBEATED PATNTEE9. 247 %0a%0a%0a%0aductions of the pictorial art, whether still in existence or %0anow lost, all of which it will be only right to take some notice %0aof. In this department, the ordinary exactness of the Greeks %0ahas been somewhat inconsistent, in placing the painters so %0amany Olympiads after the statuaries and toreutic 88 artists, and %0athe veiy first of them so late as the ninetieth Olympiad ; seeing %0athat Phidias himself is said to have been originally a painter, %0aand that there was a shield at Athens which had been painted %0aby him : in addition to which, it is universally agreed that in %0athe eighty-third Olympiad, his brother Pansenus 89 painted, at %0aElis, 90 the interior of the shield of Minerva, which had been %0aexecuted by Colotes, 91 a disciple of Phidias and his assistant %0ain the statue of the Olympian Jupiter. 92 And then besides, is it %0anot equally admitted that Candaules, the last Lydian king of the %0arace of the Heraclidae, very generally known also by the name %0aof Myrsilus, paid its weight in gold for a picture by the painter %0aBularchus, 93 which represented the battle fought by him with %0athe Magnetes ? so great was the estimation in which the art %0awas already held. This circumstance must of necessity have %0ahappened about the period of our Romulus ; for it was in the %0aeighteenth Olympiad that Candaules perished, or, as some %0awriters say, in the same year as the death of Romulus: a thing %0awhich clearly demonstrates that even at that early period the %0aart had already become famous, and had arrived at a state of %0agreat perfection. %0a%0aIf, then, we are bound to admit this conclusion, it must be %0aequally evident that the commencement of the art is of much %0aearlier date, and that those artists who painted in mono- %0achrome, 91 and whose dates have not been handed down to us, %0amust have flourished at even an anterior period ; Hygiaenon, %0anamely, Dinias, Charmadas, 95 Eumarus, of Athens, the first who %0a%0a68 " Toreutae."

On the first occasion, Panaenus him- %0aself entered the lists, at the Pythian Games, with Timagoras %0aof Chalcis, by whom he was defeated ; a circumstance which %0ais recorded in some ancient lines by Timagoras himself, and %0aan undoubted proof that the chroniclers are in error as to %0a%0a58 It is pretty clear, from vases of a very ancient date, that it is not tlie %0asexual distinction that is here alluded to. Eumarus, perhaps, may have been %0athe first to give to each sex its characteristic style of design, in the com- %0apositions, draperies, attitudes, and complexions of the respective sexes. %0aWornum thinks that, probably, Eumarus, and certainly, Cimon, belonged %0ato the class of ancient tetrachromists, or polychromists, painting in a va- %0ariety of colours, without a due, or at least a partial, observance of the %0alaws of light and shade.

After these, and yet %0abefore the ninetieth Olympiad, there were other celebrated %0apainters, Polygnotus of Thasos, 1 for instance, who was the %0afirst to paint females in transparent drapery, and to represent %0athe head covered with a parti-coloured head-dress. He, too, %0awas the first to contribute many other improvements to the %0aart of painting, opening the mouth, for example, showing the %0ateeth, and throwing expression into the countenance, in place %0aof the ancient rigidity of the features. %0a%0aThere is a picture by this artist in the Portico 2 of Pompeius, %0abefore the Curia that was built by him ; with reference to %0awhich, there is some doubt whether the man represented with %0aa shield is in the act of ascending or descending. He also %0aembellished the Temple 3 at Delphi, and at Athens the Portico %0aknown as the Pcecile ; 4 at which last he worked gratuitously, %0ain conjunction with Micon, 5 who received pay for his labours. %0aIndeed Polygnotus was held in the higher esteem of the two ; %0afor the Amphictyons, 6 who form the general Council of Greece, %0adecreed that he should have his lodging furnished him at the %0apublic expense. %0a%0aThere was also another Micon, distinguished from the first %0aMicon by the surname of "the younger," and whose daughter %0aTimarete 7 also practised the art of painting. %0a%0a!!CHAP. 36.

(Vol. II. p. 233), where he is mentioned as an Athe- %0anian. It is not improbable that he became a^citizen of Athens in the seventy- %0aninth Olympiad, b.c. 463, when Thasos was brought under the power of %0aAthens, and, as Sillig suggests, at the solicitation of Cimon, the son of %0aMiltiades.

Hence Sillig, with Bottiger, is inclined to %0athink that there were two artists of this name, one about the seventieth, %0aand the other about the ninetieth Olympiad, the former being the father %0aof Polygnotus. %0a%0a%0a%0a250 %0a%0a%0a%0aPLINY'S NATURAL HISTORY. %0a%0a%0a%0a[Book XXXV. %0a%0a%0a%0agreatest of painters, and of whom we shall have to speak %0awhen we come to the period at which he flourished. All %0athese were artists of note, but not sufficiently so to detain us %0aby any further details, in our haste to arrive at the luminaries %0aof the art ; first among whom shone Apollodorus of Athens, %0ain the ninety-third Olympiad. He was the first to paint %0aobjects as they really appeared ; the first too, we may justly %0asay, to confer glory 9 by the aid of the pencil. 10 Of this artist %0athere is a Priest in Adoration, and an Ajax struck by Light- %0aning, a work to be seen at Pergamus at the present day : %0abefore him, there is no painting of any artist now to be seen %0awhich has the power of rivetting the eye. %0a%0aThe gates of art being now thrown open by Apollodorus, %0aZeuxis of Heraclea 11 entered upon the scene, in the fourth year %0aof the ninety-fifth Olympiad, destined to lead the pencil — for %0ait is of the pencil that we are still speaking — a pencil for %0awhich there was nothing too arduous, to a very high pitch of %0aglory. By some writers he is erroneously placed in the %0aeighty-ninth Olympiad, a date that must of necessity be re- %0aserved for Demophilus of Himera and Neseus of Thasos, of %0aone of whom, it is uncertain which, Zeuxis was the pupil. %0aIt was in reference to him that Apollodorus, above-mentioned, %0awrote a verse to the effect, that Zeuxis had stolen the art %0afrom others and had taken it all to himself. 12 Zeuxis also %0aacquired such a vast amount of wealth, that, in a spirit of %0aostentation, he went so far as to parade himself at Olyrapia %0awith his name embroidered on the checked pattern of his %0agarments in letters of gold. At a later period, he came to the %0a%0a9 " Primusque gloriam penicillo jure contulit." Wornum considers %0athat " the ricli effect of the combination of light and shade with colour is %0aclearly expressed in these words." — Smith's Diet. Antiq. Art.

This was the hair-pencil or brush, which wasnsed by %0aone class of painters, in contradistinction to the stylus or cestrum used for %0aspreading the wax-colours.

Thus, for instance, %0ahe gave an Alcmena to the people of Agrigentum, and a Pan %0ato Archelaus. 13 He also painted a Penelope, in which the %0apeculiar character of that matron appears to be delineated to %0athe very life ; and a figure of an athlete, with which he was %0aso highly pleased, that he wrote beneath it the line which has %0asince become so famous, to the effect that it would be easier %0ato find fault with him than to imitate him. 14 His Jupiter %0aseated on the throne, with the other Deities standing around %0ahim, is a magnificent production : the same, too, with his %0aInfant Hercules strangling the Dragons, in presence of Am- %0aphitryon and his mother Alcmena, who is struck with horror. %0aStill, however, Zeuxis is generally censured for making the %0aheads and articulations of his figures out of proportion. And %0ayet, so scrupulously careful was he, that on one occasion, when %0ahe was about to execute a painting for the people of Agri- %0agentum, 15 to be consecrated in the Temple of the Lacinian %0aJuno there, he had the young maidens of the place stripped %0afor examination, and selected five of them, in order to adopt %0ain his picture the most commendable points in the form of %0aeach.

This last, it %0ais said, entered into a pictorial contest with Zeuxis, who %0arepresented some grapes, painted so naturally that the birds %0aflew towards the spot where the picture was exhibited. %0aParrhasius, on the other hand, exhibited a curtain, drawn with %0asuch singular truthfulness, that Zeuxis, elated with the %0ajudgment which had been passed upon his work by the birds, %0ahaughtily demanded that the curtain should be drawn aside to %0alet the picture be seen. Upon finding his mistake, with a great %0adegree of ingenuous candour he admitted that he had been %0asurpassed, for that whereas he himself had only deceived the %0abirds, Parrhasius had deceived him, an artist. %0a%0a13 King of Macedonia. %0a%0a14 MwfiT)%3cTfTai ne /taXXov ij fiifir}%3cnrai.

[Book XXXV. %0a%0a%0a%0aThere is a story, too, that at a later period, Zeuxis having %0apainted a child carrying grapes, the birds came to peck at them ; %0aupon which, with a similar degree of candour, he expressed %0ahimself vexed with his work, and exclaimed — " I have surely %0apainted the grapes better than the child, for if I had fully %0asucceeded in the last, the birds would have been in fear of %0ait." Zeuxis executed some figures also in clay, 17 the only %0aworks of art that were left behind at Ambracia, when Fulvius %0aNobilior 18 transported the Muses from that city to Home. There %0ais at Rome a Helena by Zeuxis, in the Porticos of Philippus, 19 %0aand a Marsyas Bound, in the Temple of Concord 20 there. %0a%0aParrhasius of Ephesus also contributed greatly to the pro- %0agress of painting, being the first to give symmetry to his %0afigures, the first to give play and expression to the features, %0aelegance to the hair, and gracefulness to the mouth : indeed, %0afor contour, it is universally admitted by artists that he bore %0aaway the palm. This, in painting, is the very highest point %0aof skill. To paint substantial bodies and the interior of %0aobjects is a great thing, no doubt, but at the same time it is a %0apoint in which many have excelled : but to make the extreme %0aoutline of the figure, to give the finishing touches to the %0apainting in rounding off the contour, this is a point of success %0ain the art which is but rarely attained. For the extreme %0aoutline, to be properly executed, requires to be nicely rounded, %0aand so to terminate as to prove the existence of something %0amore behind it, and thereby disclose that which it also serves %0ato hide. %0a%0aSuch is the merit conceded to Parrhasius by Antigonus 21 %0aand Xenocrates, 22 who have written on the art of painting; %0aand in this as well as in other points, not only do they admit %0ahis excellence, but enlarge upon it in terms of the highest %0acommendation. There are many pen sketches by him still in %0aexistence, both upon panel and on parchment, from the study %0aof which, even artists, it is said, may greatly profit. %0a%0aNotwithstanding these points of excellence, however, Parr- %0ahasius seems comparatively inferior to himself in giving the %0a%0a17 " Figlina opera." It is not improbable that this may allude to the %0apainting of fictile vases. %0a%0a18 a.u.c. 666.

In his alle- %0agorical picture of the People of Athens, he has displayed %0asingular ingenuity in the treatment of his subject ; for in %0arepresenting it, he had to depict it as at once fickle, choleric, %0aunjust, and versatile ; while, again, he hfed equally to show its %0aattributes of implacability 23 and clemency, compassionateness %0aand pride, loftiness and humility, fierceness and timidity — %0aand all these at once. He painted a Theseus also, which was %0aformerly in the Capitol at Rome, a Naval Commander 24 wear- %0aing a cuirass, and, in one picture, now at Ehodes, figures of %0aMeleager, Hercules, and Perseus. This last painting, though %0ait has been thrice struek by lightning, has escaped being %0aeffaced, a circumstance which tends to augment the admira- %0ation which it naturally excites. He painted an Archi- %0agallus 25 also, a picture which the Emperor Tiberius greatly %0aadmired. According to Deculo, 26 that prince had it shut up in %0ahis chamber, the price at which it was valued being six %0ahundred thousand sesterces. %0a%0aParrhasius also painted a Thracian Nurse, with an Infant %0ain her arms, a Philiscus, 27 a Father Liber 28 attended by Virtue, %0aTwo Children, in which Ave see pourtrayed the careless-sim- %0aplicity of childhood, and a Priest attended by a Boy, with a %0acenser and chaplet. There are also two most noble pictures %0aby him ; one of which represents a Runner 29 contending for the %0aprize, completely armed, so naturally depicted that he has all %0athe appearauce of sweating. In the other we see the Runner %0ataking off his armour, and can fancy that we hear him panting %0aaloud for breath. His iEneas, Castor, and Pollux, all represented %0ain the same picture, are highly praised ; his Telephus also, %0aand his Achilles, Agamemnou, and Ulysses. %0a%0aParrhasius was a most prolific artist, but at the same time %0athere was no one who enjoyed the glory conferred upon him by %0ahis talent with greater insolence and arrogance.

But above all %0athings, it was a boast? with him that he had sprung from the %0alineage of Apollo, and that he had painted his Hercules, a %0apicture now at Lindos, just as he had often seen him in his %0asleep. It was in this spirit, too, that upon being defeated by %0aTimanthes, at Samos, by a great majority of votes, the subject %0aof the picture being Ajax and the Award of the Arms, 31 he %0adeclared, in the name of his hero, that he felt himself quite %0adisgraced on thus seeing himself a second time defeated by an %0aunworthy opponent. He painted also some smaller pictures of %0aan immodest nature, indulging his leisure in such prurient %0afancies as these. 32 %0a%0aAs to Timanthes, 33 he was an artist highly gifted with %0agenius, and loud have some of the orators 34 been in their com- %0amendations of his Iphigenia, represented as she stands at the %0aaltar awaiting her doom. Upon the countenance of all pre- %0asent, that of her uncle 35 in particular, grief was depicted ; but %0ahaving already exhausted all the characteristic features of %0asorrow, the artist adopted the device of veiling the features %0aof the victim's father, 36 finding himself unable adequately to %0agive expression to his feelings. There are also some other %0aproofs of his genius, a Sleeping Cyclops, for instance, which he %0ahas painted upon a small panel ; but, being desirous to convey an %0aidea of his gigantic stature, he has painted some Satyrs near %0ahim measuring his thumb with a thyrsus. Indeed, Timanthes %0ais the only one among the artists in whose works there is %0aalways something more implied by the pencil than is expressed, %0aand whose execution, though of the very highest quality, is %0aalways surpassed by the inventiveness of his genius. He has %0aalso painted the figure of a Hero, a master-piece of skill, in %0awhich he has carried the art to the very highest pitch of per- %0a%0a30 The " Liver in luxury." Athenseus, B. xii., confirms this statement, %0aand gives some lines which Parrhasius wrote under certain of his works. %0a%0a31 Of Achilles, which were awarded to Ulysses in preference to Ajax. %0a%0a* We learn from Suetonius that Tiberius possessed a Meleager and %0aAtalanta by Parrhasius, of this nature. %0a%0a33 Said by Eustathius to have been a native of Sicyon, but by Quin- %0atilian, of Cythnos. 31 Cicero, for instance, De Oratore, c. 22, s. 74. %0a%0a35 Menelaiis. 35 Agamemnon. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 36.] AHTISTS WHO PAINTED WITH THE PENCIL. 255 %0a%0a%0a%0afection, in the delineation of the warrior : this last-mentioned %0awork is now at Rome, in the Temple of Peace. 37 %0a%0aIt was at this period, too, that Euxinidas had for his pupil %0aAristides, 38 who became a most illustrious artist; and that %0aEupompus instructed Pamphilus, who afterwards became the %0ainstructor of Apelles. There is by Eupompus, a Victor in a %0agymnastic contest, holding a palm. So high was the reputa- %0ation of this artist, that he established a school of painting, and %0aso divided the art into three styles; whereas till then there had %0abeen but two, known respectively as the Helladic 39 and the %0aAsiatic. In honour of him, a native of Sicyon by birth, the %0aHelladic school was divided into two, and from this period %0athere were three distinct styles recognized, the Ionic, the %0aSicyonian, and the Attic. %0a%0aWe have, by Pamphilus, 40 a picture representing the Alliance %0aand the Battle that was fought at Phlius ; 41 the Victory 42 also %0athat was gained by the Athenians, and a representation of %0aUlysses in his ship. He was a Macedonian by birth, but was %0athe first painter who was also skilled in all the other sciences, %0aarithmetic and geometry more particularly, without the aid of %0awhich he maintained that the pictorial art could not attain %0aperfection. He gave instruction to no one for a smaller sum %0athan one talent, at the rate of five hundred denarii per %0aannum, 43 and this fee both Apelles and Melanthius paid. It %0awas through his influence that, first at Sicyon, and then %0athroughout the whole of Greece, all children of free birth were %0ataught the graphic 44 art, or in other words, the art of depicting %0aupon boxwood, before all others ; in consequence of which this %0acame to be looked upon as the first step in the liberal arts.

[Book XXXV. %0a%0a%0a%0ais the fact, however, that this art has always been held in high %0aestimation, and cultivated by persons of free birth, and that, at a %0amore recent period, men of rank even began to pursue it ; it %0ahaving always been forbidden that slaves should receive in- %0astruction in it. Hence it is, that neither in painting nor in the %0atoreutic 45 art has there been any celebrated work executed by %0aa slave. %0a%0aIn the hundred and seventh Olympiad, flourished Aetion and %0aTherimachus. 46 By the former we have some fine pictures; a %0aFather Liber, 47 Tragedy and Comedy, Semiramis from the rank %0aof a slave elevated to the throne, an Old "Woman bearing %0atorches, and a New-made Bride, remarkable for the air of %0amodesty with which she is pourtrayed. %0a%0aBut it was Apelles 49 of Cos, in the hundred and twelfth %0aOlympiad, who surpassed all the other painters who either %0apreceded or succeeded him. Single-handed, he contributed %0amore to painting than all the others together, and even went %0aso far as to publish some treatises on the principles of the art. %0aThe great point of artistic merit with himwas his singular charm %0aof gracefulness, 50 and this too, though the greatest of painters %0awere his contemporaries. In admiring their works and be- %0astowing high eulogiums upon them, he used to say that there %0awas still wanting in them that ideal of beauty 51 so peculiar to %0ahimself, and known to the Greeks as " Charis ;" 52 others, he said, %0ahad acquired all the other requisites of perfection, but in this one %0apoint he himself had no equal. He also asserted his claim to %0aanother great point of merit : admiring a picture by Protogenes, %0awhich bore evident marks of unbounded laboriousness and the %0amost minute finish, he remarked that in every respect Proto- %0agenes was fully his equal, or perhaps his superior, except in %0athis, that he himself knew when to take his hand off a %0apicture— a memorable lesson, which teaches us that over- %0acarefulness may be productive of bad results.

The latter was living at Rhodes, %0awhen Apelles disembarked there, desirous of seeing the works %0aof a man whom he had hitherto only known by reputation. %0aAccordingly, he repaired at once to the studio ; Protogenes %0awas not at home, but there happened to be a large panel %0aupon the easel ready for painting, with an old woman who %0awas left in charge. To his enquiries she made answer, that %0aProtogenes was not at home, and then asked whom she %0ashould name as the visitor. ." Here he is," was the reply of %0aApelles, and seizing a brush, he traced with colour upon the %0apanel an outline of a singularly minute fineness. Upon his %0areturn, the old woman mentioned to Protogenes what had %0ahappened. The artist, it is said, upon remarking the delicacy %0aof the touch, instantly exclaimed that Apelles must have been %0athe visitor, for that no other person was capable of executing %0aanything so exquisitely perfect. So saying, he traced within %0athe same outline a still finer outline, but with another colour, %0aand then took his departure, with instructions to the woman %0ato show it to the stranger, if he returned, and to let him know %0athat this was the person whom he had come to see. It hap- %0apened as he anticipated ; Apelles returned, and vexed at find- %0aing himself thus surpassed, he took up another colour and split 53 %0aboth of the outlines, leaving no possibility of anything finer being %0aexecuted. Upon seeing this, Protogenes admitted that he was %0adefeated, and at once flew to the harbour to look for his guest. %0a%0aM " Secuit." Possibly meaning that he drew another outline in each %0aof these outlines. The meaning, however, is doubtful, and has occasioned %0amuch trouble to the commentators. Judging from the words used by %0aApelles and Protogenes, each in his message, it is not unlikely that the %0a" linea" or outline drawn by each was a profile of himself, and that the %0aprofile of Protogenes was drawn within that of Apelles ; who, on the %0asecond occasion, drew a third profile between the other two, but with a still %0afiner line than either of them. In Dr. Smith's Dictionary of Biography, %0aart Apelles, it is thus explained : « The most natural explanation of this %0adifficult passage seems to be, that down the middle of the first line i of %0aApelles Protogenes drew another, so as to divide it into two parallel %0ahalves, 'and that Apelles again divided the line of Protogenes in the same %0amanner." %0a%0aVOL.

I am told that it was %0aburnt in the first fire which took place at Caesar's palace on %0athe Palatine Hill ; but in former times I have often stopped %0ato admire it. Upon its vast surface it contained nothing %0awhatever except the three outlines, so remarkably fine as to %0aescape the sight : among the most elaborate works of numerous %0aother artists it had all the appearance of a blank space ; and %0ayet by that very fact it attracted the notice of every one, and %0awas held in higher estimation than any other painting there. %0a%0aIt was a custom with Apelles, to which he most tenaciously %0aadhered, never to let any day pass, however busy he might be, %0awithout exercising himself by tracing some outline or other ; a %0apractice which has now passed into a proverb. 51 It was also %0aa practice with him, when he had completed a work, to exhibit %0ait to the view of the passers-by in some exposed place ; 55 while %0ahe himself, concealed behind the picture, would listen to the %0acriticisms that were passed upon it ; it being his opinion that %0athe judgment of the public was preferable to his own, as being %0athe more discerning of the two. It was under ti#ese circum- %0astances, they say, that he was censured by a shoemaker for %0ahaving represented the shoes with one shoe-string too little. %0aThe next day, the shoemaker, quite proud at seeing tflfe former %0aerror corrected, thanks to his advice, began to criticize the %0aleg ; upon which Apelles, full of indignation, popped his head %0aout, and reminded him that a shoemaker should give no opinion %0abeyond the shoes, a piece of advice which has equally passed into %0aa proverbial saying. 56 In fact, Apelles was a person of great %0aamenity of manners, a circumstance which rendered him par- %0aticularly agreeable to Alexander the Great, who would often %0acome to his studio. He had forbidden himself, by public edict, %0aas already stated, 57 to be represented by any other artist. On %0aone occasion, however, when the prince was in his studio, %0atalking a great deal about painting without knowing anything %0aabout it, Apelles quietly begged that he would quit the sub- %0a%0a51 The Latin form of which, as given hy Erasmus, is " Nulla dies aheat, %0aquia linea ducta supersit."

And yet irascible as he was, %0aAlexander conferred upon him a very signal mark of the high %0aestimation in which he held him ; for having, in his admira- %0ation of her extraordinary beauty, engaged Apelles to paint %0aPancaste undraped, 58 the most beloved of all his concubines, %0athe artist while so engaged, fell in love with her ; upon which, %0aAlexander, perceiving this to be the case, made him a present %0aof her, thus showing himself, though a great king in courage, %0aa still greater one in self-command, this action redounding no %0ales3 to his honour than any of his victories. For in thus con- %0aquering himself, not only did he sacrifice his passions in %0afavour of the artist, but even his affections as well ; unin- %0afluenced, too, by the feelings which must have possessed his fa- %0avourite in thus passing at once from the arms of a monarch to %0athose of a painter. Some persons are of opinion that Pancaste %0awas the model of Apelles in his painting of Venus Anadyomene. 59 %0a%0aIt was Apelles too, who, courteous even to his rivals, first %0aestablished the reputation of Protogenes at Rhodes. Held as %0ahe was in little estimation by his own fellow-countrymen, %0aa thing that generally 60 is the case, Apelles enquired of him %0awhat price he set upon certain finished works of his, which %0ahe had on hand. TJpon Protogenes mentioning some very %0atrifling sum or other, Apelles made him an offer of fifty talents, %0aand then circulated a report that he was buying these works %0ain order to sell them as his own. By this contrivance, he %0aaroused the Ehodians to a better appreciation of the merits %0aof their artist, and only consented to leave the pictures with %0athem upon their offering a still larger price. %0a%0aHe painted portraits, too, so exactly to the life, that a fact %0awith which we are made acquainted by the writings of Apion %0athe grammarian seems altogether incredible.

Apelles %0ahad been on bad terms with Ptolemaeus in former times, when %0athey formed part of the suite of Alexander. After Ptokmaeus %0ahad become king of Egypt, it so happened that Apelles was %0adriven by the violence of a tempest to Alexandria. Upon this, %0asome of his rivals fraudulently suborned a jester, who was at- %0atached to the court, to carry him an invitation to dine with the %0aking. Accordingly, Apelles attended ; upon which Ptolemaeus %0awas highly indignant, and, summoning before him his stewards 6 * %0aof the household, requested that the artist would point out the %0aone that had given him the invitation. Thus challenged, %0aApelles seized a piece of quenched charcoal that lay in the %0afire-place, and traced a likeness upon the wall, with such ex- %0aactness, that the king, the moment he began it, recognized the %0afeatures as those of the jester. He also painted a portrait of %0aKing Antigonus ; 63 and as that monarch was blind of one eye, he %0ainvented a method of concealing the defect. "With this object, %0ahe painted him in profile, in order that what in reality was %0awanting to the person might have the semblance of being %0awanting to the picture rather, he making it his care to show %0athat side of the face only which he could show without any %0adefect. Among his works, too, there are some figures repre- %0asenting persons at the point of death ; but it is not easy to say %0awhich of his productions are of the highest order of excellence. %0a%0aHis Venus Rising from the Sea, known as the Venus Anady- %0aomene, 64 was consecrated by the late Emperor Augustus in the %0aTemple 65 of his father 66 Ceesar ; a work which has been cele- %0a%0a61 « Physiognomists." %0a%0a62 " Vocatores" — more literally, his " inviting officers." %0a%0a63 Strabo mentions a portrait of Antigonus in the possession of the %0ainhabitants of Cos. %0a%0a61 See Note 59 above.

How many times he painted Alexander and %0aPhilip, it would be quite superfluous to attempt to enumerate. %0aAt Samoa, there is a Habron 75 by him, that is greatly admired ; %0aat Khodes a Menander, 76 king of Caria, and an Ancaeus ; 77 at %0a%0a07 There are several Epigrams descriptive of it in the Greek Anthology. %0a%0aM This, probably, is the meaning of " Tali opere dum laudatur victo sed %0aillustrato," words which have given much trouble to the commentators. %0a%0a6tf Nothing further seems to be known of him. %0a%0a70 " Cois." The first one was also painted for the people of Cos, by %0awhom it was ultimately sold to Augustus. %0a%0a71 See Chapter 32 of this Book. That this is an erroneous assertion, %0ahas been shown in Note 78 above. %0a%0a72 Probably the weight of the panel, frame, and ornamental appendages. %0a%0a73 This word was probably a title, meaning " Keeper of the temple." %0aStrabo tells us that the "megabyzi," or as he calls thera, the " megalo- %0abyzi," were eunuch priests in the Temple of Artemis, or Diana, at Ephesus. %0a%0a74 The favourite of Alexander, by whom he was afterwards slain. %0a%0a75 Probably the name of a rich sensualist who lived at Argos. A son %0aof the Attic orator Lycurgus, one of the sophists, also bore this name. %0a%0a76 This name is supposed by Sillig to have been inserted erroneously, %0aeither by Pliny, or by his transcribers. %0a%0a71 Either the Argonaut of that name, who was killed by the Caledonian %0a%0a%0a%0a262 %0a%0a%0a%0aplint's natubal nisTonr. %0a%0a%0a%0a[Book XXXV. %0a%0a%0a%0aAlexandria, a Gorgosthenes,theTragedian; and at Rome, aCastor %0aand Pollux, with figures of Victory and Alexander the Great, %0aand an emblematical figure of War with her hands tied be- %0ahind her, and Alexander seated in a triumphal car ; both of %0awhich pictures the late Emperor Augustus, with a great degree %0aof moderation 78 and good taste, consecrated in the most fre- %0aquented parts of his Forum : the Emperor Claudius, however, %0athought it advisable to efface the head of Alexander in both %0apictures, and substitute likenesses of his predecessor Augustus. %0aIt is by his hand too, it is generally supposed, that the Her- %0acules, with the face averted, now in the Temple of Anna,™ was %0apainted ; a picture in which, one of the greatest difficulties in %0athe art, the face, though hidden, may be said to be seen rather %0athan left to the imagination. He also painted a figure of a %0anaked 80 Hero, 81 a picture in which he has challenged Nature %0aherself. %0a%0aThere exists too, or did exist, a Horse that was painted by %0ahim for a pictorial contest ; as to the merits of which, Apcllcs %0aappealed from the judgment of his fellow-men to that of the %0adumb quadrupeds. For, finding that by their intrigues his %0arivals were likely to get the better of him, he had some horses %0abrought, and the picture of each artist successively shown to %0athem. Accordingly, it was only at the sight of the horse %0apainted by Apelles that they began to neigh ; a thing that has %0aalways been the case since, whenever this test of his artistic %0askill has been employed. He also painted a Neoptolemus 82 on %0ahorse-back, fighting with the Persians ; an Archelaus, 63 with %0ahis Wife and Daughter ; and an Antigonus on foot, with a %0a%0aBoar, or else, which is the most prohahle, a King of the Lelegesin Samos, %0a■with whom, according to the Scholiast on Apollonius Rhodius, originated %0athe saying, " There is many a slip between the cup and the lip ;" in refer- %0aence to his death, by a wild boar, when he was about to put a cup of wine %0ato his mouth. %0a%0a18 Shown in his forbearing to appropriate them to his own use. %0a%0a" 9 Anna Perenna, probably, a Roman divinity of obscure origin, the %0alegends about whom are related in the Fasti of Ovid, B. iii. 1. 523. et seq. %0aSee also Macrobius, Sat.

Connoisseurs in the %0aart give the preference, before all other works of his, to his %0apaintings of King Archeliius on horseback, and of Diana %0ain the midst of a throng of Virgins performing a sacri- %0afice ; a work in which he would appear to have surpassed %0athe lines 84 of Homer descriptive of the same subject. He %0aalso portrayed some things, which in reality do not admit %0aof being portrayed — thunder, lightning, and thunderbolts, in %0apictures which are known by the respective names of Bronte, %0aAstrape, and Ceraunobolia. %0a%0aHis inventions, too, in the art of painting, have been highly %0aserviceable to others ; but one thing there was in which no one %0acould imitate him. When his works were finished, he used to %0acover them with a black varnish, of such remarkable thinness, %0athat while by the reflection it gave more vivacity to the colours, %0aand preserved them from the contact of dust and dirt, its %0aexistence could only be detected by a person when close enough %0ato touch it. 85 In addition to this, there was also this other %0agreat advantage attending it: the brightness of the colours %0awas softened thereby, and harmonized to the sight, looking as %0athough they had been viewed from a distance, and through a %0amedium of specular-stone j 86 the contrivance, by some indescri- %0abable means, giving a sombreness to colours which would other- %0awise have been too florid. > %0a%0aOne of the contemporaries of Apelles was Anstules ot %0aThebes ; the first of all the painters to give full expression to %0athe mind 68 and passions of man, known to the Greeks as %0aas well as to the mental perturbations which we experience : %0ahe was somewhat harsh, however, in his colours.

Aristides also painted a Battle with the Per- %0asians, a picture which contained one hundred figures, tor each %0aof which he was paid at the rate of ten minae by Mnason, the %0atyrant of Elatea." 9 He also painted Chariots with four horses %0ain full career ; a Suppliant, which almost speaks, Huntsmen %0awith game ; Leontion, the mistress of Epicurus ; the Anapau- %0aomene, 80 a damsel pining to death from love for her brother ; %0aa Father Liber 91 also, and an Artamene, two fine pictures now %0ato be seen in the Temple of Ceres 92 at Rome ; a Tragedian and %0aa Child, in the Temple of Apollo, 93 a picture which has lost its %0abeauty, owing to the unskilfulness of the painter to whom M. %0aJunius, the praetor, entrusted the cleaning of it, about the %0aperiod of the Apollinarian Games. 91 There Was also to be %0aseen, in the Temple of Faith, in the Capitol, a picture of his, %0arepresenting an Aged Man giving instructions to a Child on %0athe lyre. He executed also a painting of an Invalid, upon %0a■which endless encomiums have been lavished.

Great poverty in his early days, and extreme %0aapplication to his art, were the causes of his comparative un- %0aproductiveness.

Of all his compositions, however, the %0apalm has been awarded to his Ialysus, 1 now at Pome, con- %0asecrated in the Temple of Peace there. So long as he was at %0awork upon it, he lived, it is said, upon nothing but soaked %0alupines ; by which means he at once appeased both hunger and %0athirst, and avoided all risk of blunting his perception by too %0adelicate a diet. In order to protect this picture against the effects %0aof ill-usage and old agef he painted it over four times, 2 so that %0awhen an upper coat might fail, there would be an under one to %0asucceed it. There is in this picture the figure of a dog, %0awhich was completed in a very remarkable manner, inasmuch %0aas accident had an equal share with design in the execution of %0ait. The painter was of opinion that he had not given the %0aproper expression to the foam at the mouth of the animal, %0apanting for breath, as it was represented ; while, with all %0aother parts of the picture, a thing extremely difficult with him, %0ahe was perfectly satisfied. The thing that displeased him was, %0athe evident traces of art in the execution of it, touches which %0adid not admit of any diminution, and yet had all the appear- %0aance of being too laboured, the effect produced being far re- %0amoved from his conception of the reality : the foam, in fact, %0a%0a97 Or Vestibule. %0a%0a9S Supposed by Sillig to have been an allegorical painting representing %0atwo of the sacred ships of the Athenians ; but to have been mistaken in %0alater times for a picture of Ulysses and Nausicaa, a subject taken from %0athe Odyssey, B. vi. 1. 16, et seq.

Vexed and tormented %0aby this dilemma, it being his wish to depict truth itself, and %0anot something that only bore a semblance of truth, he effaced %0ait again and again, changed his pencil for another, and yet by %0ano possibility could satisfy himself. At last, quite out of tem- %0aper with an art, which, in spite of him, would still obtrude %0aitself, he dashed his sponge against the vexatious spot ; when %0abehold ! the sponge replaced the colours that it had just removed, %0aexactly in accordance with his utmost wishes, and thus did %0achance represent Nature in a painting. %0a%0aFollowing his example, Nealces, 3 it is said, succeeded in %0arepresenting the foam at a horse's mouth ; for on one occasion,, %0awhen engaged in painting a man holding in a pair of horses %0aand soothing them with his voice, 4 he also dashed his sponge %0aagainst the picture, with the view of producing a like effect. %0a%0aIt was on account of this Ialysus, which he was apprehen- %0asive of destroying, that King Demetrius 5 forbore to set fire to %0athe only side of the city of Khodes by which it was capable of %0abeing taken ; and thus, in his anxiety to spare a picture, did %0ahe lose his only opportunity of gaining a victory. The %0adwelling of Protogenes at this period was situate in a little %0agarden in the suburbs, or in other words, in the midst of the %0acamp of Demetrius. The combats that were taking place %0amade no difference whatever to the artist, and in no way in- %0aterrupted his proceeding with the works which he had com- %0amenced ; until at last he was summoned before the king, who %0aenquired howhe could have the assurance thus to remain without %0athe walls. "Because I know," was his answer, "that you %0aare waging war with the Rhodians, and not with the arts." %0aUpon this, the king, delighted at having the opportunity of %0aprotecting the hand which he had thus spared, ordered a %0aguard to be placed at his disposal for the especial purpose of %0ahis protection. In order, too, that he might not distract the %0aartist's attention by sending for him too often, he would often %0ago, an enemy albeit, to pay him a visit, and, abandoning his %0aaspirations for victory, in the midst of arms and the battering %0adown of walls, would attentively examine the compositions of the %0a%0a3 See Chapter 40 in this Book. %0a%0a4 " Poppyzonta."

Even to this day, the story is still attached to the %0apicture which lie was then engaged upon, to the effect, that %0aProtogenes painted it beneath the sword. It is his Satyr, %0aknown as the " Anapauomenos ;" 6 in whose hand, to mark the %0asense of security that he felt, the painter has placed a pair of %0apipes. %0a%0aProtogenes executed also, a Cydippe ; a Tlepolemus ; a %0aportrait of Philiscus, the tragic poet, in an attitude of medi- %0atation ; an Athlete ; a portrait of King Antigonus, and one of %0athe mother of Aristotle. 7 It was this philosopher too, who %0aadvised him to paint the exploits of Alexander the Great, as %0abeing certain to be held in everlasting remembrance. The %0aimpulse, however, of his natural disposition, combined with a %0acertain artistic caprice, led him in preference to adopt the %0avarious subjects which have just been mentioned. His last %0aworks were representations of Alexander and the god Pan. %0aHe also executed some figures in bronze, as already 8 stated. %0a%0aAt the same period also, lived Asclepiodorus, 9 who was %0agreatly admired by Apelles for his proportions. The tyrant %0aMnason 10 paid him, for his picture of the Twelve Gods, at the %0arate of thirty minae for each divinity. This same Mnason also %0apaid Theomnestus twenty minae for each of his Heroes. %0a%0aIn addition to these, it is only proper to mentionNicomachus, 11 %0athe son and disciple of Aristioeus. He painted a Rape of %0aProserpina, a picture that was formerly in the Temple of %0aMinerva in the Capitol, above the shrine of Juventas. 12 Another %0apicture of his was to be seen also in the Capitol, placed there by %0athe Poman general Plancus, 13 a Victory soaring aloft in a %0achariot: he was the first painter who represented Ulysses %0awearing the pileus. 14 He painted also an Apollo and Liana ; %0athe Mother 16 of the Gods seated on a Lion ; the fine picture %0aof the Bacchantes, witb Satyrs moving stealthily towards %0a%0a6 " In repose." %0a%0a7 Phaestis, or Phaestias by name. 8 In B. xxxiv. c. 19. %0a%0a9 A native of Athens, ranked by Plutarch with Euphranor and Nicias. %0a%0a10 Tyrant of Elatca, mentioned already in this Chapter.

Among his pupils, were his brother Anston, his %0ason Aristides, and Philoxenus of Eretria, who painted for %0aKing Cassander a picture representing one of the battles be- %0atween Alexander and Darius, a work which may bear com- %0aparison with any. He also painted a picture in grotesque, %0arepresenting Three Sileni at their revels. Imitating the %0acelerity of execution displayed by his master, he introduced a %0amore sketchy style of painting, executed in a comparatively %0aoff-hand manner. 18 %0a%0aTo these artists Nicophanes 19 has also been added, an ele- %0agant and finished painter, to whom for gracefulness few can %0abe compared, but for a severe and tragic style far inferior to %0aZeuxis or Apelles.

His subjects were barbers' shops, cob- %0ablers' stalls, jackasses, eatables, and the like, and to these he was %0aindebted for his epithet of " Bhyparographos." 22 His paintings, %0ahowever, are exquisitely pleasing, and have sold at higher %0aprices than the very largest works of many masters. %0a%0aOn the other hand again, as Yarro tells us, a single picture %0aby Serapio covered the whole space of the balustrades, 23 %0abeneath the Old Shops, 21 where it was exhibited. This artist %0awas very successful in painting stage-scenery, but was unable %0ato depict the human form. Dionysius, 25 on the contrary, %0apainted nothing but men, and hence it was that he had the %0asurname of " Anthropographos." 26 Callicles 27 also painted %0asome small pictures, and Calates executed some small works in %0athe comic style. Both of these styles were adopted by %0aAntiphilus ; 28 who painted a very fine Hesione, and a Philip %0aand Alexander with Minerva, now in the School of the %0aPorticos 29 of Octavia. In the Portico of Philippus, 30 also, %0athere is a Father Liber 31 by him ; an Alexander when a child ; %0aand an Hippolytus alarmed at the Bull, which is rushing %0aupon him : 32 and in the Portico of Pompeius 33 we have his %0aCadmus and Europa.

For with them, it was not the practice to %0adecorate the walls of houses, for the gratification of the %0aowners only ; nor did they lavish all their resources upon a %0adwelling which must of necessity always remain a fixture in %0aone spot, and admits of no removal in case of conflagration. %0aProtogenes was content with a cottage in his little garden ; %0aApelles had no paintings on the plaster of his walls ; it not %0abeing the fashion in their day to colour the party-walls of %0ahouses from top to bottom. With all those artists, art was %0aever watchful for the benefit of whole cities only, and in those %0atimes a painter was regarded as the common property of all. %0a%0aShortly before the time of the late Emperor Augustus, %0aArellius was in high esteem at Kome ; and with fair reason, %0ahad he not profaned the art by a disgraceful piece of profanity ; %0afor, being always in love with some woman or other, it was %0ahis practice, in painting goddesses, to give them the features of %0ahis mistresses ; hence it is, that there were always some figures %0aof prostitutes to be seen in his pictures. More recently, lived %0aAmulius, 41 a grave and serious personage, but a painter in %0athe florid style. By this artist there was a Minerva, which %0ahad the appearance of always looking at the spectators, from %0awhatever point it was viewed. He only painted a few hours %0aeach day, and then with the greatest gravity, for he always %0akept the toga on, even when in the midst of his implements. %0aThe Golden Palace 42 of .Nero was the prison-house of this %0aartist's productions, and hence it is that there are so few of %0athem to be be seen elsewhere. %0a%0aNext in repute to him were Cornelius Pinus and Attius %0aPriscus, who painted the Temple of Honour and that of %0aVirtue, 43 on their restoration by the Emperor Vespasianus %0aAugustus. Priscus approaches more closely to the ancient %0amasters. %0a%0a41 Most editions give " Famulus."

THE MARVELLOUS PRICE OF SOME PICTURES. %0a%0aIt is said, too, that Pamphilus, 49 the instructor of Apelles, not %0aonly painted in encaustic, but also instructed Pausias 50 of Sicyon %0ain the art, the first who rendered himself distinguished in this %0abranch. Pausias was the son of Bryetes, by whom he was %0aoriginally instructed in the art of painting. He retouched %0aalso with the pencil 51 some walls at Thespiae, then undergoing %0arepair, which had formerly been painted by Polygnotus. Upon %0ainstituting a comparison, however, it was considered that he %0awas greatly inferior, this kind of painting not being in his %0aline. It was he, too, who first thought of painting ceilings : %0anor had it been the practice before his day to use this kind of %0adecoration for arched roofs. He painted many small pictures %0aalso, miniatures of children more particularly ; a thing which, %0aaccording to the interpretation put upon it by his rivals, was %0aowing to the peculiarly 6low process of encaustic painting. %0aThe consequence was, that being determined to give a memo- %0arable proof of his celerity of execution, he completed a picture %0ain the space of a single day, which was thence called the %0a"Hemeresios," 52 representing the portrait of a child. %0a%0aIn his youth, he was enamoured of Glycera, 53 his fellow- %0atownswoman, the first inventor of chaplets ; and in his rivalry %0aof the skill shown by her, he achieved so much success in the %0aencaustic art, as to reproduce the almost numberless tints dis- %0aplayed by flowers. At a later period, he painted her, seated, %0awith a chaplet on, and thus produced one of the very finest %0aof his pictures ; known as the " Stephaneplocos" 04 by %0asome, and as the " Stephanopolis" 55 by others ; from the circum- %0astance that Glycera had supported herself in her poverty by %0aselling these chaplets. A copy of this picture, usually known %0aas an " apographon," 66 was purchased by L. Lucullus at Athens, %0aduring the festival of the Dionysia, at the price of two talents. %0a%0aPausias also painted some large pictures, a Sacrifice of Oxen, %0afor instance, which used to be seen in the Portico of Pom- %0a's See Chapter 36 of tins Book. %0a%0a80 Two paintings of Lis at Epidaurus are mentioned by Pausanias, B. ii. %0ac. 27. %0a%0a41 And not in encaustic ; though, as we shall see in Chapter 41, the brush %0awas sometimes used in this branch. 52 The " One day" picture. %0a%0aM See B. xxi. c. 3. « The " Chaplet- wearer."

In this painting he invented several improvements, %0awhich many artists have since imitated, but none with the %0asame success. Although in the picture it was particularly his %0adesire to give an impression of the length of the ox, he %0apainted it with a front view and not sideways, and still has %0acaused the large dimensions of the animal to be fully under- %0astood. And then too, whereas all other painters colour in %0awhite such parts as they wish to have the appearance of %0abeing prominent, and in black such portions as are intended %0ato remain in the back-ground, he has painted the whole of the %0aox of a black colour, and has shown the dimensions of .the %0abody which throws the shadow by the medium of the shadow %0aitself ; thus evincing a wonderful degree of skill in showing %0arelief upon a coat painted with a single colour, and conveying %0aan impression of uniform solidity upon a broken ground. 57 It %0awas at Sicyon also that Pausias passed his life, a city which %0afor a long time continued to be the native place of painting. %0aUltimately, all the paintings belonging to that place were sold %0aby public auction for the discharge of the debts owing by the %0acity, and were transferred to Rome in the sedileship of %0aScaurus. 68 %0a%0aNext to him, in the hundred and fourth Olympiad, Eu- %0aphranor, 69 the Isthmian, distinguished himself far beyond all %0aothers, an artist who has been already mentioned in our %0aaccount of the statuaries. He executed some colossal figures %0aalso, and some statues in marble, and he chased some drinking- %0avessels ; being studious and laborious in the highest degree, %0aexcellent in every branch, and at all times equal to himself. %0aThis artist seems to have been the first to represent heroes with %0abecoming dignity, and to have paid particular attention to sym- %0ametry. Still, however, in the generality of instances, he has %0amade the body slight in proportion to the head and limbs. He- %0acomposed some treatises also upon symmetry and colours. His %0aworks are, an Equestrian Combat ; 60 the Twelve Gods ; and a %0a%0a57 " In confracto." Meaning probably the group of the surrounding %0aspectators, on which the shadow of the animal's body was thrown.

His prin- %0acipal glory was his having been the instructor of Nicias 65 of %0aAthens ; who was a most careful painter of female portraits, %0aand a strict observer of light and shade, 65 making it his es- %0apecial care that the figures in his pictures should appear in %0athe boldest relief. His works are, a Nemea, which was %0abrought from Asia to Home by Silanus, and was placed in %0athe Curia, as already stated; 67 a Father Liber, 68 in the %0aTemple 69 of Concord ; a Hyacinthus, 70 which the Emperor %0aAugustus was so delighted with, that he took it away with %0ahim after the capture of Alexandria; for which reason also it %0awas consecrated in the Temple 71 of Augustus by the Emperor %0aTiberius ; and a Danae.

He also executed some large %0apictures, among which there are a Calypso, an Io, an An- %0adromeda, a very fine Alexander, in the Porticos' 4 of Pompeius, %0aand a Calypso, seated. To this painter also there are some %0apictures of cattle attributed, and in his dogs he has been re- %0amarkably successful. It was this Nicias, with reference to %0awhom, Praxiteles, when asked with which of all his works in %0amarble he was the best pleased, made answer, " Those to %0awhich Nicias has set his hand," so highly did he esteem the %0acolouring of that artist. It has not been satisfactorily ascer- %0atained whether it is this artist or another of the same name %0athat some writers have placed in the hundred and twelfth %0aOlympiad. %0a%0aWith Nicias has been compared, and indeed sometimes %0apreferred to him, Athenion of Maronea, 75 a pupil of Glaucion %0aof Corinth. In his colouring he is more sombre than Nicias, %0aand yet, with all his sombreness, more pleasing ; so much so %0aindeed, that in his paintings shines forth the extensive know- %0aledge which he possessed of the art. He painted, in the %0aTemple at Eleusis, a Phylarchus ; 76 and at Athens, a family %0agroup, which has been known as the " Syngenicon ;" 77 an %0aAchilles also, concealed in a female dress, and Ulysses de- %0atecting him; a group of six whole-length figures, in one %0apicture ; and, a work which has contributed to his fame more %0athan any other, a Groom leading a Horse. Indeed, if he had %0anot died young, there would have been no one comparable to %0aAthenion in painting. %0a%0aHeraclides, too, of Macedon, had some repute as an artist. %0aAt first he was a painter of ships, but afterwards, on the cap- %0ature of King Perseus, he removed to Athens ; where at the %0asame period was also Metrodorus, 78 who was both a painter %0aand a philosopher, and of considerable celebrity in both %0a_ 73 " Place of the prophecies of the dead ;" in reference to the descrip- %0ation of the Infernal Regions in the Fourth Book of the Odyssey. %0a%0a74 See Chapter 37 of this Book. « See B. iv. c. 18. %0a%0a76 Supposed hy Hardouin to he the writer mentioned at the' end of B. %0ayii. and B. x. : or perhaps, " a chief" of an Athenian tribe. %0a%0a77 A "group of kindred." is A disciple of Carneades.

Paulus iEmilius, after %0athe conquest of Perseus, 79 requested the Athenians to send %0ahim the most esteemed philosopher for the education of his %0achildren, and a painter to represent his triumph, they made %0achoice of Metrodorus, declaring that he was eminently suited %0afor either purpose ; a thing which Paulus admitted to he the %0acase. %0a%0aTimomachus of Byzantium, in the time of the Dictator Caesar, %0apainted an Ajax 80 and a Medea, which were placed by Caesar %0ain the Temple of Venus Genetrix, having been purchased at %0athe price of eighty talents ; the value of the Attic talent %0abeing, according to M. Varro, equivalent to six thousand %0adenarii. An Orestes, also by Timomachus, an Iphigenia in %0aTauris, and a Lecythion, a teacher of gymnastics, are equally %0apraised ; a Noble Family also ; and Two Men clothed in the %0apallium, 61 and about to enter into conversation, the one stand- %0aing, the other in a sitting posture.

[[#chap41]]%0a%0aIn ancient times there were but two methods of encaustic 36 %0apainting, in wax and on ivory, 36 with the cestrum or pointed %0agraver. When, however, this art came to be applied to the %0apainting of ships of war, a third method was adopted, that of %0amelting the wax colours and laying them on with a brush, %0awhile hot. 37 Painting of this nature, 38 applied to vessels, will %0anever spoil from the action of the sun, winds, or salt water. %0a%0a!!CHAP. 42. THE COLOURING OF TISSUES. [[#chap42]]%0a%0aIn Egypt, too, they employ a very remarkable process for the %0acolouring of tissues. After pressing the material, which is white %0aat first, they saturate it, not with colours, but with mordents %0athat are calculated to absorb colour. This done, the tissues, %0astill unchanged in appearance, are plunged into a cauldron of %0aboiling dye, and are removed the next moment fully coloured. %0aIt is a singular fact, too, that although the dye in the pan is of %0aone uniform colour, the material when taken out of it is of %0avarious colours, according to the nature of the mordents that %0ahave been respectively applied to it: these colours, too, will never %0awash out.

Wornum is of opinion that the definition at the %0abeginningof this Chapter, of two methods apparently, "mwax and on ivory," %0ais in reality an explanation of owe method only, and that the ancient modes %0aof painting in encaustic were not only three, but several. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 43 ] TIIE INVENTORS OF THE ART OF MODELLINO. 283 %0a%0a%0a%0astances, no doubt, would have made but one colour of several, %0aif coloured tissues had been put into it, is here made to yield %0aseveral colours from a single dye.

(12.") — THE INVENTORS OF THE ART OF MODELLING. [[#chap43]]%0a%0aOn painting we have now said enough, and more than enough ; %0abut it will be only proper to append some accounts of the %0aplastic art. Butades, a potter of Sicyon, was the first who in- %0avented, at Corinth, the art of modelling portraits in the earth %0awhich he used in his trade. It was through his daughter that %0ahe made the discovery; who, being deeply in love with a young- %0aman about to depart on a long journey, traced the profile of %0ahis face, as thrown upon the wall by the light of the lamp. Upon %0aseeing this, her father filled in the outline, by compressing clay %0aupon the surface, and so made a face in relief, which he then %0ahardened by fire along with other articles of pottery. This %0amodel, it is said, was preserved in the Nymphaeum 39 at Corinth, %0auntil the destruction of that city by Mummius. 40 Others, again, %0aassert that the first inventors of the plastic art were Ehcecus 41 %0aand Theodorus, 43 at Samos, a considerable period before the ex- %0apulsion of the Bacchiadae from Corinth : and that Damaratus, 43 %0aon taking to flight from that place and settling in Etruria, where %0ahe became father of Tarquinius, who was ultimately king of %0athe ltoman people, was accompanied thither by the modellers %0aEuchir, 44 Diopus, and Eugrammus, by whose agency the art %0awas first introduced into Italy. %0a%0a39 Or Temple of the Nymplis. The daughter of Butades is called " Core" %0aby Athenagoras. 40 See B. xxxiv. c. 3. %0a%0a41 Son of Philaeus. He is mentioned by Pausanias, B. viii. c. 14, and %0aby Herodotus, B. iii. c. 60, as the architect of a fine temple at Samos, %0aand, with Smilis and Theodorus, of the Labyrinth at Lemnos. %0a%0a43 Mentioned also in B. xxxiv. c. 19. Pliny is in error here in using the %0aword " plastice ;" for it was the art of casting brass, and not that of making %0aplaster casts, that these artists invented. %0a%0a13 See Chapter 5 of this Book. He is said by Dionysius of Halicar- %0anassus, B. iii., to have been a member of the family of the Bacchiadte. %0a%0ail A different person, probably, from theone of the same name mentioned %0ain B. vii. c. 56. %0a%0a%0a%0a234 %0a%0a%0a%0aflint's natural iiistohy. %0a%0a%0a%0a[Took XXXV. %0a%0a%0a%0aButades first invented the method of colouring plastic com- %0apositions, by adding red earth to the material, or else modelling %0athem in red chalk : he, too, was the first to make masks on the %0aouter edges of gutter-tiles upon the roofs of buildings ; in %0alow relief, and known as "prostypa" at first, but afterwards %0ain high relief, or " ectypa." It was in these designs, 46 too, that %0athe ornaments on the pediments of temples originated; %0aand from this invention modellers first had their name of %0au plastaj." %0a%0a!!CHAP. 44. — WHO WAS THE FIRST TO MOULD FIGURES IN IMITATION OF THE FEATCKKS OF LIVING PERSONS, OR OF STATCES. [[#chap44]]%0a%0aThe first person who expressed the human features by fitting %0aa mould of plaster upon the face, and then improving it by %0apouring melted wax into the cast, was Lysistratus 48 of Sicyou, %0abrother of Lysippus, already mentioned. It was he, in fact, %0awho first made it his 6tudy to give a faithful likeness; for %0abefore his time, artists only thought how to make their por- %0atraits as handsome as possible. The same artist, too, was the %0afirst who thought of making models for his statues ; a method %0awhich afterwards became so universally adopted, that there %0acould be neither figure nor statue made without its model in %0aclay. Hence it would appear, that the art of modelling in %0aclay is more ancient than that of moulding in bronze. 47 %0a%0a!!CHAP. 45. — THE MOST FAMOUS MODELLERS. [[#chap45]]%0a%0aThe most celebrated modellers were Damophilus and Gor- %0agasus, who were painters as well. These artists adorned with %0atheir works, in both kinds, the Temple of Ceres, 48 in the Circus %0aMaximus at Rome ; with an inscription in Greek, which %0astated that the decorations on the right-hand were the work- %0amanship of Damophilus, and those on the left, of Gorgasus. %0aVarro says that, before the construction of this temple, every, %0athing was Tuscan 49 in the temples; and that, when the temple %0awas afterwards repaired, the painted coatings of the walls were %0a%0a45 Terra cotta figures. %0a%0a« See B. xxxiv. c. 19.

Yarro states that he knew an artist at Rome, Possis by %0aname, who executed fruit, grapes, and fish, with such exact- %0aness, that it was quite impossible, by only looking at them, to %0adistinguish them from the reality. He speaks very highly %0aalso of Arcesilaiis, 53 who was on terms of intimacy with %0aLucius Lucullus, 54 and whose models in plaster used to sell at %0aa higher rate, among artists themselves, than the works of %0aothers. He informs us, also, that it was by this modeller that %0athe Venus Genetrix in the Porum of Caosar was executed, it %0ahaving been erected before completion, in the great haste that %0athere was to consecrate it; that the same artist had made an %0aagreement with Lucullus to execute a figure of Felicity, at the %0aprice of sixty thousand sesterces, the completion of which was %0aprevented by their death; and that Octavius, a Eoman of %0aequestrian rank, being desirous of a model for a mixing-bowl-, 65 %0aArcesilaiis made him one in plaster, at the price of one talent. %0a%0aVarro praises Pasiteles 66 also, who used to say, that the %0aplastic art was the mother of chasing, statuary, and sculpture, %0aand who, excellent as lie was in each of these branches, never %0aexecuted any work without first modelling it. In addition to %0athese particulars, he states that the art of modelling was %0aanciently cultivated in Italy, Etruria in particular ; and that %0aVolcanius was summoned from Veii, and entrusted by Tar- %0aquinius Priscus with making the figure of Jupiter, which he %0aintended to consecrate in the Capitol ; that this Jupiter was %0amade of clay, and that hence arose the custom of painting it %0awith minium ; 57 and that the four-horse chariot, so often 58 %0a%0asn Sillig (Diet. Anc.

[[#chap46]]%0a%0aStatues of this nature are still in existence at various %0aplaces. At Rome, in fact, and in our municipal towns, we %0astill see many such pediments of temples; wonderful too, for their %0aworkmanship, and, from their artistic merit and long duration, %0amore deserving of our respect than gold, and certainly far less %0abaneful. At the present day even, in the midst of such %0awealth as we possess, we make our first libation at the sacrifice, %0anot from murrhine 6 * vases or vessels of crystal, but from ladles" %0amade of earthenware. %0a%0aBounteous beyond expression is the earth, if we only consider %0ain detail her various gifts. To omit all mention of the cereals, %0awine, fruits, herbs, shrubs, medicaments, and metals, bounties %0awhich she has lavished upon us, and which have already passed %0aunder our notice, her productions in the shape of pottery %0aalone, would more than suffice, in their variety, to satisfy our %0adomestic wants; what with gutter- tiles of earthenware, vats for %0areceiving wine, pipes 62 for conveying water, conduits 53 for %0asupplying baths, baked tiles for roofs, bricks for foundations, %0athe productions, too, of the potter's wheel; results, all of %0athem, of an art, which induced King Numa to establish, as a %0aseventh company, 64 that of the makers of earthenware. %0a%0aEven more than this, many persons have chosen to be buried %0ain coffins 65 made of earthenware ; M.

For the %0aservice of the table, the Samian pottery is even yet held in high %0aesteem ; that, too, of Arretium in Italy, still maintains its high %0acharacter ; while for their cups, and for those only, the ma- %0anufactories of Surrentum, Asta, Pollentia, Saguntum in Spain, %0aand Pergamus in Asia, 66 are greatly esteemed. %0a%0aThe city of Tralles, too, in Asia, and that of Mutina in Italy, %0ahave their respective manufactures of earthenware, and even %0aby this branch of art are localities rendered famous ; their pro- %0aductions, by the aid of the potter's wheel, becoming known to %0aall countries, and conveyed by sea and by land to every %0aquarter of the earth. At Erythrae, there are still shown, in %0aa temple there, two amphorae, that were consecrated in con- %0asequence of the singular thinness of the material : they origin- %0aated in a contest between a master and his pupil, which of the %0atwo could make earthenware of the greatest thinness. The %0avessels of Cos are the most highly celebrated for their beauty, %0abut those of Adria 61 are considered the most substantial. %0a%0aIn relation to these productions of art, there are some in- %0astances of severity mentioned : Q. Coponius, we find, was %0acondemned for bribery, because he made present of an am- %0aphora of wine to a person who had the right of voting. To %0amake luxury, too, conduce in some degree to enhance our esti- %0amation of earthenware, " tripatinium,'' 68 as we learn from %0aFenestella, was the name given to the most exquisite course of %0adishes that was served up at the Horn an banquets. It con- %0asisted of one dish of mursense, 69 one of lupi, 70 and a third of a %0amixture of fish. It is clear that the public manners were %0athen already on the decline ; though we still have a right to %0ahold them preferable to those of the philosophers even of %0aGreece, seeing that the representatives .of Aristotle, it is said, %0asold, at the auction of his goods, as many as seventy dishes of %0aearthenware. It has been already 71 stated by us, when on the %0aBubject of birds, that a single dish cost the tragic actor iEsopus %0aone hundred thousand sesterces ; much to the reader's indigna- %0ation, no doubt; but, by Hercules!

It was in reference to %0athis circumstance, that Mucianus, in his second consulship, %0awhen pronouncing one of his perorations, reproached the %0amemory of Vitellius with his dishes as broad as the Pomp tine %0aMarsh ; not less deserving to be execrated than the poisoned %0adish of Asprenas, which, according to the accusation brought %0aagainst him by Cassius Severus, caused the death of one %0ahundred and thirty guests. 73 %0a%0aThese works of artistic merit have conferred celebrity on %0asome cities even, Rhegium for example, and Cumae. The %0apriests of the Mother of the gods, known as the Galli, deprive %0athemselves of their virility with a piece of Samian 74 pottery, %0athe only means, if we believe M. Caelius, 75 of avoiding dangerous %0aresults. He it was, too, who recommended, when inveighing %0aagainst certain abominable practices, that the person guilty of %0athem should have his tongue cut out, in a similar manner ; %0aa reproach which would appear to have been levelled by anti- %0acipation against this same Vitellius. %0a%0aWhat is there that human industry will not devise ?

At all events, %0ait was for this purpose that it used to be brought over for %0aPatrobius, 81 a freedman of the Emperor Nero. I find it stated %0aalso, that Craterus, Leonnatus, and Meleager, generals of Alex- %0aander the Great, had this sand transported along with their %0amunitions of war.

THE METHOD OF MAKING BRICKS. [[#chap49]]%0a%0aEarth for making bricks should never be extracted from a %0asandy or gravelly soil, and still less from one that is stony ; %0abut from a stratum that is white and cretaceous, or else im- %0apregnated with red earth. 81 If a sandy soil must be employed %0afor the purpose, it should at least be male 88 sand, and no other. %0aThe spring is the best season for making bricks, as at midsum- %0amer they are very apt to crack. For building, bricks two %0ayears old are the only ones that are approved of; and the %0awrought material of them should be well macerated before %0athey are made. %0a%0aThere are three different kinds of bricks ; the Lydian, which %0ais in use with us, a foot-and-a-half in length by a foot in %0abreadth ; the tetradoron ; and the pentadoron ; the word "doron" %0abeing used by the ancient Greeks to signify the palm 88 — hence, %0atoo, their word " doron" meaning a gift, because it is the %0ahand that gives. — These last two kinds, therefore, are named %0arespectively from their being four and five palms in length, %0athe breadth being the same. The smaller kind is used in %0aGreece for private buildings, the larger for the construction of %0apublic edifices. At Pitane, 87 in Asia, and in the cities of Max- %0ailua and Calentum in Farther Spain, there are bricks 88 made, %0awhich float in water, when dry ; the material being a sort of %0a%0a83 See B. ii. c. 73 . 84 "Rubrica." 85 g ee B> c 2 8. %0a%0a86 "Which was, as a measure, nearly three inches in breadth.

Delafosse thinks %0athat a place called " Cala," in the Sierra Morena, probably marks the site %0aof the cities above mentioned. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 50.] %0a%0a%0a%0aSULPHITE. %0a%0a%0a%0a291 %0a%0a%0a%0apumice-earth, extremely good for the purpose when it can be %0amade to unite. The Greeks have always preferred walls of %0abrick, except in those cases where they could find silicious %0astone for the purposes of building : for walls of this nature %0awill last for ever, if they are only built on the perpendicular. %0aHence it is, that the Greeks have built their public edifices and %0athe palaces of their kings of brick ; the wall at Athens, for %0aexample, which faces Mount Hymettus ; the Temples of %0aJupiter and Hercules at Patrae, 89 although the columns and %0aarchitraves in the interior are of stone ; the palace of King %0aAttalus atTralles; the palace of Croesus at Sardes, now con- %0averted into an asylum 90 for aged persons ; and that of King %0aMausolus at Halicarnassus ; edifices, all of them, still in ex- %0aistence. %0a%0aMuraenaand Varro, in their aedileship, had a fine fresco paint- %0aing, on the plaster of a wall at Lacedsemon, cut away from %0athe bricks, and transported in wooden frames to Rome, for the %0apurpose of adorning the Comitium. Admirable as the work %0awas of itself, it was still more admired after being thus trans- %0aferred. In Italy also there are walls of brick, at Arretiuni %0aand Mevania. 91 At Rome, there are no buildings of this de- %0ascription, because a wall only a foot-and-a-half in thickness %0awould not support more than a single story; and by public %0aordinance it has been enacted that no partition should exceed %0athat thickness ; nor, indeed, does the peculiar construction of %0aour party- walls admit of it. %0a%0a!!CHAP. 50.

[[#chap50]]%0a%0aLet thus much be deemed sufficient on the subject of bricks. %0aAmong the other kinds of earth, the one of the most singular %0anature, perhaps, is sulphur, an agent of great power upon other %0asubstances. Sulphur is found in the iEolian Islands, between %0aSicily and Italy, which are volcanic, as already 92 stated. But %0athe finest sulphur of all, is that which comes from the Isle of %0aMelos. It is obtained also in Italy, upon the range of hills in %0athe territories of Neapolis and Campania, known as the Leuco- %0agsei : 93 when extracted from the mines there, it is purified by %0athe agency of fire. %0a%0a89 See B. iv. c. 5, and B. xxxvi. c. 4. %0a%0a»" " Gerusia." 91 See li. iii. c. 19. 92 In B. iii. c. 6. %0a%0a93 See B. xviii. c. 29. %0a%0aU 2 %0a%0a%0a%0a2!) 2 pliny's natural history. [Book XXXV. %0a%0aThere are four kinds of sulphur ; the first of which is " live" %0asulphur, known as " apyron" 91 by the Greeks, and found in solid %0amasses, or in other words, in blocks. This, too, is the only sulphur %0athat is extracted in its native state, the others being found in a %0astate of liquescence, and requiring to be purified by being boiled %0ain oil. This kind is green and transparent, and is the only %0asulphur that is used for medicinal purposes. A second kind is %0aknown as the " glebaceous" 95 sulphur, and is solely employed in %0athe workshops of the fullers. The third kind, also, is only used %0afor a single purpose, that of fumigating wool, a process which %0acontributes very greatly to making the wool white and soft ; %0a" egula" 95 is the name given to it. The fourth kind is used %0ain the preparation of matches more particularly. %0a%0aIn addition to these several uses, sulphur is of such remark- %0aable virtue, that if it is thrown upon the fire it will at once %0adetect, by the smell, whether or not a person is subject to %0aepilepsy. Anaxilaiis used to employ this substance by way %0aof pastime : putting sulphur in a cup of wine, with some %0ahot coals beneath, he would hand it round to the guests, the %0alight given by it, while burning, throwing a ghastly paleness %0alike that of death upon the face of each. Its properties are ca- %0alorific and maturative, in addition to which, it disperses abscesses %0aon the body : hence it is that it is used as an ingredient in %0aplasters and emollient poultices. Applied to the loins and %0akidneys, with grease, when there are pains in those parts, it %0ais marvellously effectual as a remedy. In combination with %0aturpentine, it removes lichens on the face, and leprosy, 96 the %0apreparation being known as " harpax," 97 from the celerity %0awith which it acts upon the skin ; for which reason it ought to %0abe removed every now and then. Employed as an electuary, it is %0agood for asthma, purulent expectorations, and stings inflicted %0aby scorpions. Live sulphur, mixed with nitre, and then bruised %0awith vinegar and applied, causes morphew to disappear, and %0adestroys nits in the hair ; in combination, too, with sandarach %0aand vinegar, it is good for diseases of the eyelids. %0a%0aSulphur has its place among our religious ceremonies, being %0aused as a fumigation for purifying houses. 98 Its virtues are %0a%0a94 "Untouched by fire."

BITUMEN, AND THE SEVERAL VARIETIES OF IT; TWENTY-SEVEN REMEDIES. [[#chap51]]%0a%0aNearly approaching to the nature of sulphur is that of bitu- %0amen, 1 which in some places assumes the form of a slime, and %0ain others that of an earth ; a slime, thrown up, as already 2 %0astated, by a certain lake in Judaea, and an earth, found in the %0avicinity of Sidon, a maritime town of Syria. In both these %0astates, it admits of being thickened and condensed. There %0ais also a liquid 3 bitumen, that of Zacynthus, for example, and %0athe bitumen that is imported from Babylon ; which last kind %0ais also white : the bitumen, too, of Apollonia is liquid. All %0athese kinds, in Greek, have the one general name of "pissas- %0aphaltos," 4 from their strong resemblance to a compound of %0apitch and bitumen. There is also found an unctuous liquid %0abitumen, resembling oil, in a spring at Agrigentum, in Sicily, %0athe waters of which are tainted by it. The inhabitants of the %0aspot collect it on the panicles of reeds, to which it very readily %0aadheres, and make use of it for burning in lamps, as a sub- %0astitute for oil, as also for the cure of itch- scab in beasts of %0aburden. %0a%0aSome authorities include among the bitumens, naphtha, a sub- %0astance which we have already mentioned in the Second Book; 5 %0abut the burning properties which it possesses, and its sus- %0aceptibility of igniting, render it quite unfit for use. Bitumen, %0ato be of good quality, should be extremely brilliant, heavy, %0aand massive ; it should also be moderately smooth, it being %0avery much the practice to adulterate it with pitch.

Pissasphalt, of a medium consistency between the other sub- %0astances, of which it appears to be composed.

Babylonian bitumen ia %0avery efficacious, it is said, for the cure of cataract and albngo, %0aas also of leprosy, lichens, and pruriginous affections. Bitu- %0amen is employed, too, in the form of a liniment, for gout ; and %0aevery variety of it is useful for making bandolines for eye- %0alashes that are refractory and impede the sight. Applied topi- %0acally with nitre, 6 it is curative of tooth-ache, and, taken in- %0aternally, with wine, it alleviates chronic coughs and difficulty %0aof respiration. It is administered in a similar manner for %0adysentery, and is very good for arresting looseness of the %0abowels. Taken internally with vinegar, it dissolves and brings %0aaway coagulated blood. It modifies pains also in the loins %0aand joints, and, applied with barlej'-meal, it forms a peculiar %0akind of plaster, to which it has given its name. 7 It stanches %0ablood also, heals wounds, and unites the sinews when severed. %0aBitumen is administered for quartan fevers, in doses of one %0adrachma to an equal quantity of hedyosmos, 8 the whole kneaded %0aup with one obolus of myrrh. The smell of burnt bitu- %0amen detects a tendency to epilepsy, and, applied to the %0anostrils with wine and castoreum, 9 it dispels suffocations of %0athe uterus. Employed as a fumigation, it acts as a check upon %0aprocidence of the uterus, and, taken internally with wine, it %0ahas the effect of an emmenagogue. %0a%0aAnother use that is made of it, is for coating the inside %0aof copper vessels, it rendering them proof against the action %0aof fire. It has been already 10 stated that bitumen was formerly %0aemployed for staining copper and coating statues. It has been %0aused, too, as a substitute for lime ; the walls of Babylon, for %0ainstance, which are cemented with it. In the smithies they are %0ain the habit of varnishing iron and heads of nails with it, and %0aof using it for many other purposes as well. %0a%0a!!CHAP. 52.

Of this, too, %0athere are several kinds. In Cyprus there is a white alumen, %0aand another kind of a darker colour. The difference, however, %0ain their colour is but trifling in reality, though the uses made %0aof them are very dissimilar ; the white liquid alumen being %0aemployed for dyeing 13 wool of bright colours, and the black, %0aon the other hand, for giving wool a tawny or a sombre tint. %0aGold, too, is purified 11 by the agency of black alumen. Every %0akind of alumen is a compound of slime and water, or in other %0awords, is a liquid product exuding from the earth; the concre- %0ation of it commencing in winter, and being completed by the %0aaction of the summer sun. That portion of it which is the %0afirst matured, is the whitest in appearance. %0a%0aThe countries which produce this substance, are Spain, %0auiEgypt, Armenia, Macedonia, Pontus, Africa, 18 and the islands %0aof Sardinia, Melos, Lipara, and Strongyle : 16 the most es- %0ateemed, however, is that of Egypt, 17 the next best being the %0aproduce of Melos. Of this last kind there are also two %0avarieties, the liquid alumen, and the solid. Liquid alumen, %0ato be good, should be of a limpid, milky, appearance : when %0arubbed between the fingers it should be free from grit, and %0aproductive of a slight sensation of heat. The name given to it %0ais " phorimon." 18 The mode of detecting whether or not it has %0abeen adulterated, is by the application of pomegranate-juice ; %0afor if genuine, it will turn black on combining with the %0ajuice. The other, or solid alumen, is pale and rough in ap- %0a%0a11 Beckmann is of opinion that our alum was not known to the Greeks %0aor Romans, and that what the latter called " alumen" was green vitriol, %0aor sulphate of the protoxide of iron, in an impure state.

The remedy, %0awhen thus used, is employed in the bath, the proportions %0abeing two parts of honey to one of alumen. It has the effect, %0aalso, of checking and dispersing perspiration, and of neu- %0atralizing offensive odours of the arm-pits. It is taken too, in %0athe form of pills, for affections of the spleen, and for the pur- %0apose of carrying off blood by the urine : incorporated with nitre %0aand melanthium, 20 it is curative of itch-scab. %0a%0aThere is one kind of solid alumen, known to the Greeks as %0a" schiston," 21 which splits into filaments of a whitish colour; %0afor which reason some have preferred giving it the name of %0a" trichitis." 22 It is produced from the mineral ore known to %0aus as " chalcitis," 23 from which copper is also produced, it %0abeing a sort of exudation from that mineral, coagulated into %0athe form of scum. This kind of alumen is less desiccative %0athan the others, and is not so useful as a check upon bad %0ahumours of the body. Used, however, either in the form of a %0aliniment or of an injection, it is highly beneficial to the ears ; %0aas also for ulcerations of the mouth, and for tooth-ache, if %0aretained with the saliva in the mouth. It is employed also %0aas a serviceable ingredient in compositions for the eyes, and %0afor the generative organs in either sex. The mode of pre- %0aparing it is to roast it in crucibles, until it has quite lost its %0aliquid form. %0a%0aThere is another variety of alumen also, of a less active na- %0ature, and known as " strongyle ;" 2i which is again subdivided %0ainto two kinds ; the fungous, which easily dissolves in any %0aliquid, and is looked upon as altogether worthless ; and the %0aporous, which is full of small holes like a sponge, and in %0apieces of a globular form, more nearly approaching white %0aalumen in appearance.

Whether taken internally, or %0aemployed externally, it arrests discharges of blood ; and if it is %0aapplied with vinegar to a part from which the hair has been %0afirst removed, it will change into a soft down the hair which %0areplaces it. The leading property of every kind of alumen is %0aits remarkable astringency, to which, in fact, it is indebted for %0aits name 26 with the Greeks. It is for this property that the %0avarious kinds are, all of them, so remarkably good for the %0aeyes. In combination with grease, they arrest discharges of %0ablood ; and they are employed in a similar manner for check- %0aing the spread of putrid ulcers, and for removing sores upon %0athe bodies of infants. %0a%0aAlumen has a desiccative effect upon dropsical eruptions ; %0aand, in combination with pomegranate juice, it removes dis- %0aeases of the ears, malformed nails, indurations resulting from %0acicatrization, hangnails, and chilblains. Calcined, with vine- %0agar or nut-galls, in equal proportions, it is curative of phage- %0adaenic ulcers; and, in combination with extracted juice of %0acabbage, of leprosy. Used in the proportion of one part of %0aalumen to two of salt, it arrests the progress of serpiginous %0aeruptions ; and an infusion of it in water destroys lice and %0aother parasitical insects that infest the hair. Employed in a %0asimilar manner, it is good for burns ; and, in combination with %0athe serous 27 part of pitch, for furfuraceous eruptions on the %0abody. It is used also as an injection for dysentery, and, em- %0aployed in the form of a gargle, it braces the uvula and tonsil- %0alary glands.

It is used more particularly as a cosmetic for %0athe skin of females; the Selinusian 34 earth being also employed %0afor a similar purpose. This last is of a milk-white colour, %0aand melts very rapidly in water : dissolved in milk, it is em- %0aployed for whitening the plaster coats on walls. Pnigitis 35 is %0avery similar to Eretrian earth, only that it is found in larger %0amasses, and is of a glutinous consistency. Its effects are %0asimilar to those produced by Cimolian 36 earth, but are not so %0aenergetic. %0a%0aAinpelitis 37 is an earth which bears a strong resemblance to %0abitumen. The test of its goodness is its dissolving in oil, like %0awax, and preserving its black colour when submitted to the %0aaction of fire. Its properties are emollient and repercussive ; %0afor which reason, it is used in medicinal compositions, those %0aknown as " calliblephara," 38 more particularly, and in prepara- %0ations for dyeing the hair. %0a%0a!!CHAP. 57.

They are curative %0aalso of inflammatory swellings and imposthumes of the parotid %0aglands; and, applied topically, they are good for affections of %0athe spleen and pustules on the body. With the addition of %0aaphronitrum, 41 oil of cypros, 42 and vinegar, they reduce %0aswellings of the feet, care being taken to apply the lotion in %0athe sun, and at the end of six hours to wash it off with salt %0aand water. In combination with wax and oil of cypros, %0aCimolian earth is good for swellings of the testes. %0a%0aCretaceous earths, too, are of a cooling tendency, and, %0aapplied to the body in the form of a liniment, they act as a %0acheck upon excessive perspiration : taken with wine, in the %0abath, they remove pimples on the body. The most esteemed %0aof all these earths is that of Thessaly : it is found also in the %0avicinity of Bubon 43 in Lycia. %0a%0aCimolian earth is used also for another purpose, that of %0ascouring cloth. As to the kind which is brought from Sar- %0adinia, and is known as "sarda," it is used for white tissues %0aonly, and is never employed for coloured cloths. Indeed, this %0alast is held in the lowest estimation of all the Cimolian earths; %0awhereas, that of Umbria is more highly esteemed, as also the %0akind generally known as " saxum." 44 It is a property of %0athis last to increase in weight 45 by maceration, and it is by %0aweight that it is usually sold, Sardinian earth being sold by- %0ameasure. Umbrian earth is only used for giving lustre to %0acloths. %0a%0aIt will not be deemed out of place to give some further %0aaccount here of this process, there being still in existence the %0aMetilian Law, relative to fullers; an enactment which C. %0aFlaminius and L. JEmilius, in their censorship, 46 had passed by %0a%0acretaceous earth, but an aluminous silicate, still found in the island of %0aKimoli, or Argentiera, one of the Cyclades ; See B. iv. c. 23. Tourne- %0afort describes it as a white chalk, very heavy, tasteless, and dissolving in %0a■water. It is found also at Alexandrowsk in Russia. %0a%0a40 See Chapter 25 of this Book. a See B. xxxi. c. 46. %0a%0a42 See B. xii. c. 51. 43 gee B. v. c. 28! %0a%0a44 Beckmann thinks that this may have been our common chalk. %0aVol. II. p. 105. %0a%0a45 This seems to be the meaning of " crescit in macerando." %0a%0a46 a.u.c. 535, it is supposed. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 58.] %0a%0a%0a%0aAEGENTARIA. %0a%0a%0a%0a301 %0a%0a%0a%0athe people, 47 so attentive to everything were our ancestors. %0aThe following then is the method employed in preparing %0acloth : it is first washed in an infusion of Sardinian earth, and %0ais then exposed to a fumigation with sulphur. This done, it is %0ascoured 48 with Cimolian earth, when the cloth has been found %0ato be of a genuine colour ; it being very soon detected when it %0ahas been coloured with spurious materials, by its turning %0ablack and the colours becoming dispersed 50 by the action of the %0asulphur. "Where the colours are genuine and rich, they are %0a6oftened by the application of Cimolian earth ; which brightens %0aand freshens them also when they have been rendered sombre %0aby the action of the sulphur. Saxum is better for white tissues, %0aafter the application of sulphur, but to coloured cloths it is %0ahighly injurious. 51 In Greece they use Tymphaean 52 gypsum in %0aplace of Cimolian earth. %0a%0a!!CHAP. 58.

[[#chap58]]%0a%0aThere is another cretaceous earth, known as " argentaria," 53 %0afrom the brightness 54 which it imparts to silver. There is also %0athe most inferior kind of chalk ; which was used by the %0aancients for tracing the line of victory 55 in the Circus, and for %0amarking the feet of slaves on sale, that were brought from %0abeyond sea. Such, for instance, were Publilius 56 Lochius, the %0a%0a47 As a plebiscitum. %0a%0a18 " Desquamatur." This is most probably the meaning of the word, %0athough Beckmann observes " that it was undoubtedly a term of art, which %0acannot be further explained, because we are unacquainted with the opera- %0ation to which it alludes." — Vol II. p. 104. Bohn's Edition. %0a%0a60 " Funditur sulphure." The meaning of these words is very doubt- %0aful. Beckmann proposes to read " offenditur," but he is not supported %0aby any of the MSS. He has evidently mistaken the meaning of the %0awhole passage. %0a%0a51 Probably because it was too calcareous, Beckmann thinks. %0a%0a52 See B. iv. c. 3, and B. xxxvi. c. 59. %0a%0a53 Plate powder; from " argentum," "silver."

But why mention these names, recommended as they are %0aby the literary honours which they acquired ? Other instances %0atoo, Rome has beheld of persons rising to high positions from %0athe slave-market ; 69 Chrysogonus, for example, the freedman %0aof Sylla ; Amphion, the freedman of Q,. Catulus ; the man who %0awas the keeper 60 of Lucullus ; Demetrius, the freedman of Pom- %0apeius, and Auge, the freedwoman of Demetrius, 61 or else of %0aPompeius himself, as some have supposed ; Hipparchus, the %0afreedman of M. Antonius ; as also, Menas 62 and Menecrates, 63 %0afreedmen of Sextus Pompeius, and many others as well, whom %0ait would be superfluous to enumerate, and who have enriched %0athemselves at the cost of Boinan blood, and the licence that %0aresults from proscription. %0a%0aSuch is the mark that is set upon those droves of slaves %0awhich we see on sale, such the opprobrium thrown upon them %0aby a capricious fortune ! And yet, some of these very men have %0awe beheld in the enjoyment of such power and influence, that %0athe senate itself has decreed them — at the command of Agrip- %0apina, 64 wife of the Emperor Claudius — the decorations even of %0athe praetorship : all but honoured with the fasces and their %0alaurels, in fact, and sent back in state to the very place from %0awhich they originally came, with their feet whitened with the %0aslave- dealer's chalk ! %0a%0a67 Supposed by some to have been the Manilius who was author of the %0apoem called " Astronomica," still in existence. It is more probable, how- %0aever, that he was the father of the poet, or perhaps the grandfather ; as it %0ais clear from a passage in Suetonius, that Staberius Eros taught at Borne %0aduring the civil wars of Sylla, while the poem must have been written, in %0apart at least, after the death of Augustus. %0a%0a58 Being afterwards manumitted.

(1.) — THE HONOUR ATTACHED TO PAINTING. %0a%3c %0a%3c I have now given at considerable length an account of the %0a%3c nature of metals, which constitute our wealth, and of the %0a%3c substances that are derived from them ; so connecting my %0a%3c various subjects, as, at the same time, to describe an immense %0a%3c number of medicinal compositions which they furnish, the %0a%3c mysteries 1 thrown upon them by the druggists, and the tedious %0a%3c minutiaj of the arts of chasing, 2 and statuary, 3 and of dyeing. 4 %0a%3c It remains for me to describe the various kinds of earths and %0a%3c stones ; a still more extensive series of subjects, each of which %0a%3c has been treated of, by the Greeks more particularly, in a great %0a%3c number of volumes. For my own part, I propose to employ a %0a%3c due degree of brevity, at the same time omitting nothing that %0a%3c is necessary or that is a product of Nature. %0a%3c %0a%3c I shall begin then with what still remains to be said with %0a%3c reference to painting, an art which was formerly illustrious, %0a%3c when it was held in esteem both by kings and peoples, and %0a%3c ennobling those whom it deigned to transmit to posterity. %0a%3c But at the present da) r , it is completely banished in favour %0a%3c of marble, and even gold. For not only are whole walls now %0a%3c covered with marble, but the marble itself is carved out or %0a%3c else marqueted so as to represent objects and animals of %0a%3c various kinds. No longer now are we satisfied with formal %0a%3c compartitions of marble, or with slabs extended like so many %0a%3c mountains in our chambers, but we must begin to paint the %0a%3c very stone itself! This art was invented in the reign of %0a%3c Claudius, but it was in the time of Nero that we discovered the %0a%3c method of inserting in marble spots that do not belong to it, %0a%3c %0a%3c 1 " Officinarum tenebrae ;" probably in reference to the ignorance dis- %0a%3c played by the compounders of medicines, as pointed out in B. xxxiii. c. 38, %0a%3c and in B. xxxiv. c. 25. — B. 9 See B. xxxiii. c. 55. %0a%3c %0a%3c s See B. xxxiv. c. 9. 4 See B. xxxiii. c. 36. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 224 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c pliht's NATURAL HISTOET. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XXXV. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c and so varying its uniformity ; and this, for the purpose of %0a%3c representing the marble of Numidia 5 variegated with ovals, %0a%3c and that of Synnada 6 veined with purple; just, in fact, as %0a%3c luxury might have willed that Nature should produce them. %0a%3c Such are our resources when the quarries fail us, and luxury %0a%3c ceases not to busy itself, in order that as much as possible may %0a%3c be lost whenever a conflagration happens. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 2. (2.) — THE HONOUR ATTACHED TO PORTRAIT8. %0a%3c %0a%3c Correct portraits of individuals were formerly transmitted to %0a%3c future ages by painting ; but this has now completely fallen into %0a%3c desuetude. Brazen shields are now set up, and silver faces, with %0a%3c only some obscure traces of the countenance : 7 the very heads, %0a%3c too, of statues are changed, 8 a thing that has given rise before %0a%3c now to many a current sarcastic line ; so true it is that people %0a%3c prefer showing off the valuable material, to having a faithful %0a%3c likeness. And yet, at the same time, we tapestry the walls of %0a%3c our galleries with old pictures, and we prize the portraits of %0a%3c strangers; while as to those made in honour of ourselves, we %0a%3c esteem them only for the value of the material, for some heir to %0a%3c break up and melt, and so forestall the noose and slip-knot of %0a%3c the thief. 9 Thus it is that we possess the portraits of no %0a%3c living individuals, and leave behind us the pictures of our %0a%3c wealth, not of our persons. %0a%3c %0a%3c And yet the very same persons adorn the palaestra and the %0a%3c anointing-room 10 with portraits of athletes, and both hang %0a%3c up in their chamber and carry about them a likeness of %0a%3c Epicurus. 11 On the twentieth day of each moon they cele- %0a%3c brate his birthday 11 * by a sacrifice, and keep his festival, %0a%3c known as the "leas," 12 every month : and these too, people who %0a%3c %0a%3c 5 See B. xxxvi. c. 8. 6 See B. v. c. 29. %0a%3c %0a%3c 7 " Surdo figuravum discrimine." %0a%3c %0a%3c 8 We are informed by Suetonius, that this practice existed in the time %0a%3c of Tiberius.— B. See also Note 18, p. 196. %0a%3c %0a%3c 9 Which he is ready to employ in carrying away his plunder. %0a%3c %0a%3c 10 " Ceromata ;" this is properly a Greek term, signifying an ointment %0a%3c used by athletes, composed of oil and wax. — B. %0a%3c %0a%3c 11 This practice is referred to by Cicero, De Finib. B. v. — B. %0a%3c %0a%3c n * In reality, his birth-day was not on the twentieth day of any month ; %0a%3c but, for some reason which is not known, he fixed upon this day. — B. He %0a%3c was born on the seventh day of the month Gamelion. %0a%3c %0a%3c 12 From the Greek thed^, the "twentieth" day of the month. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 2.] THE HOXOUR ATTACHED TO PORTRAITS. 225 %0a%3c %0a%3c wish to live without being known ! 13 So it is, most assuredly, %0a%3c our indolence has lost sight of the arts, and since our minds %0a%3c are destitute of any characteristic features, those of our bodies %0a%3c are neglected also. %0a%3c %0a%3c But on the contrary, in the days of our ancestors, it was %0a%3c these that were to be seen in their halls, and not statues made %0a%3c by foreign artists, or works in bronze or marble : portraits %0a%3c modelled in wax 14 were arranged, each in its separate niche, %0a%3c to be always in readiness to accompany the funeral processions %0a%3c of the family ; 15 occasions on which every member of the %0a%3c family that had ever existed was always present. The pedi- %0a%3c gree, too, of the individual was traced in lines upon each of %0a%3c these coloured portraits. Their muniment-rooms, 16 too, were %0a%3c filled with archives and memoirs, stating what each had done %0a%3c when holding the magistracy.

Not only do we consecrate in our libraries, in gold %0a%3c or silver, or at all events, in bronze, those whose immortal %0a%3c spirits bold converse with us in those places, but we even go %0a%3c so far as to reproduce the ideal of features, all remembrance of %0a%3c which has ceased to exist ; and our regrets give existence to %0a%3c likenesses that have not been transmitted to us, as in the case %0a%3c of Homer, for example. 20 And indeed, it is my opinion, that %0a%3c nothing can be a greater proof of having achieved success in %0a%3c life, than a lasting desire on the part of one's fellow-men, to %0a%3c know what one's features were. This practice of grouping %0a%3c portraits was first introduced at Rome by Asinius Pollio, %0a%3c who was also the first to establish a public library, and so %0a%3c make the works of genius the property of the public. %0a%3c "Whether the kings of Alexandria and of Pergamus, who had %0a%3c so energetically rivalled each other in forming libraries, had %0a%3c previously introduced this practice, I cannot so easily say. %0a%3c %0a%3c That a strong passion for portraits formerly existed, is %0a%3c attested both by Atticus, the friend of Cicero, who wrote a %0a%3c work on this subject, 21 and by M.

The first %0a%3c who practised this line-drawing were Aridices, the Corinthian, %0a%3c and Telephanes, the Sicyonian, artists who, without making %0a%3c use of any colours, shaded the interior of the outline by %0a%3c drawing lines ; 3G hence, it was the custom with them to add to %0a%3c the picture the name of the person represented. Ecphantus, %0a%3c the Corinthian, was the first to employ colours upon these %0a%3c pictures, made, it is said, of broken earthenware, reduced to %0a%3c powder. "We shall show on a future 37 occasion, that it was a %0a%3c different artist of the same name, who, according to Cornelius %0a%3c Nepos, came to Italy with Demaratus, the father of the Roman %0a%3c king, Tarquinius Priscus, on his flight from Corinth to escape %0a%3c the violence of the tyrant Cypselus. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 6. — THK ANTIQUITY OF PAINTING IN ITALY. %0a%3c %0a%3c But already, in fact, had the art of painting been perfectly %0a%3c developed in Italy. 38 At all events, there are extant in the %0a%3c temples at Ardea, at this day, paintings of greater antiquity %0a%3c than Rome itself ; in which, in my opinion, nothing is more %0a%3c marvellous, than that they should have remained so long %0a%3c unprotected by a roof, and yet preserving their freshness. 39 At %0a%3c Lanuvium, too, it is the same, where we see an Atalanta and a %0a%3c Helena, without drapery, close together, and painted by the %0a%3c %0a%3c ture, consisted in tracing the shadow of a human head or some other ob- %0a%3c ject on the wall, the interior being filled up with one uniform shade of %0a%3c colour. — B. %0a%3c %0a%3c 34 From the Greek novoxp&paTov, " single colouring."— B. %0a%3c %0a%3c 35 He is mentioned also by Athenagoras, Strabo, and Athenasus. %0a%3c %0a%3c 36 Called " graphis," by the Greeks, and somewhat similar, probably, to %0a%3c our pen and ink drawings. %0a%3c %0a%3c 37 In Chapter 43 of this Book.— B. %0a%3c %0a%3c 38 Ajasson remarks, that a great number of paintings have been lately %0a%3c discovered in the Etruscan tombs, in a very perfect state, and probably of %0a%3c very high antiquity. — B. %0a%3c %0a%3c 39 There would appear to be still considerable uncertainty respecting %0a%3c the nature of the materials employed by the ancients, and the manner of %0a%3c applying them, by which they produced these durable paintings ; a %0a%3c branch of the art which has not been attained in equal perfection by the %0a%3c modems. — B. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 230 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c plint's natural history. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XXXV. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c same artist.

(4.) — ROMAN PAINTERS. %0a%3c %0a%3c Among the Romans, too, this art very soon rose into esteem, %0a%3c for it was from it that the Fabii, a most illustrious family, de- %0a%3c rived their surname of " Pictor ;" indeed the first of the family %0a%3c who bore it, himself painted the Temple of Salus, 43 in the year %0a%3c of the City, 450 ; a work which lasted to our own times, but was %0a%3c destroyed when the temple was burnt, in the reign of Claudius. %0a%3c Next in celebrity were the paintings of the poet Pacuvius, in %0a%3c the Temple of Hercules, situate in the Cattle Market : 44 he was %0a%3c a son of the sister of Ennius, and the fame of the art was %0a%3c enhanced at Rome by the success of the artist on the stage. %0a%3c After this period, the art was no longer practised by men of %0a%3c rank ; unless, indeed, we would make reference to Turpilius, %0a%3c in our own times, a native of Venetia, and of equestrian rank, %0a%3c several of whose beautiful works are still in existence at %0a%3c Verona.

Pedius, 45 who had been honoured with the consulship and a %0a%3c triumph, and who had been named by the Dictator Caesar as %0a%3c co-heir with Augustus, had a grandson, who being dumb from %0a%3c his birth, the orator Messala, to whose family his grandmother %0a%3c belonged, recommended that he should be brought up as a %0a%3c painter, a proposal which was also approved of by the late %0a%3c Emperor Augustus. He died, however, in his youth, after %0a%3c having made great progress in the art. But the high estima- %0a%3c tion in which painting came to be held at Rome, was prin- %0a%3c cipally due, in my opinion, to M. Valerius Maximus Messala, %0a%3c who, in the year of the City, 490, was the first to exhibit a %0a%3c painting to the public ; a picture, namely, of the battle in %0a%3c which he had defeated the Carthaginians and Hiero in Sicily, %0a%3c upon one side of the Curia Hostilia." 16 The same thing was done, %0a%3c too, by L. Scipio, 47 who placed in the Capitol a painting of the %0a%3c victory which he had gained in Asia ; but his brother Africanus, %0a%3c it is said, was offended at it, and not without reason, for his %0a%3c son had been taken prisoner in the battle. 48 Lucius Hostilius %0a%3c Mancinus, 49 too, who had been the first to enter Carthage at the %0a%3c final attack, gave a very similar offence to iEmilianus, 49 * by %0a%3c exposing in the Forum a painting of that city and the attack %0a%3c upon it, he himself standing near the picture, and describing %0a%3c to the spectators the various details of the siege ; a piece of %0a%3c complaisance which secured him the consulship at the ensuing %0a%3c Comitia. %0a%3c %0a%3c The stage, too, which was erected for the games celebrated %0a%3c by Claudius Pulcher, 80 brought the art of painting into great %0a%3c admiration, it being observed that the ravens were so de- %0a%3c ceived by the resemblance, as to light upon the decorations %0a%3c which were painted in imitation of tiles. %0a%3c %0a%3c 45 Q.

For upon %0a%3c the sale of the spoil on that occasion, King Attalus having pur- %0a%3c chased, at the price of six thousand denarii, a painting of Fa- %0a%3c ther Liber by Aristides, 51 Mummius, feeling surprised at the %0a%3c price, and suspecting that there might be some merit in it of %0a%3c which he himself was unaware, 52 in spite of the complaints of %0a%3c Attalus, broke off the bargain, and had the picture placed in %0a%3c the Temple of Ceres ; 53 the first instance, I conceive, of a foreign %0a%3c painting being publicly exhibited at Rome. %0a%3c %0a%3c After this, I find, it became a common practice to exhibit %0a%3c foreign pictures in the Forum ; for it was to this circumstance %0a%3c that we are indebted for a joke of the orator Crassus. While %0a%3c pleading below the Old Shops, 64 he was interrupted by a witness %0a%3c who had been summoned, with the question, " Tell me then, %0a%3c Crassus, what do you take me to be ? " " Very much like %0a%3c him," answered he, pointing to the figure of a Gaul in a pic- %0a%3c ture, thrusting out his tongue in a very unbecoming manner. 55 %0a%3c It was in the Forum, too, that was placed the picture of the %0a%3c Old Shepherd leaning on his staff ; respecting which, when the %0a%3c envoy of the Teutones was asked what he thought was the %0a%3c value of it, he made answer that he would rather not have %0a%3c the original even, at a gift. %0a%3c %0a%3c CUAP. 9. — AT WHAT PERIOD PAINTING WAS FIBST HELD IN HIGH %0a%3c ESTEEM AT ROME, AND FBOM WHAT CAUSES. %0a%3c %0a%3c But it was the Dictator Caesar that first brought the public %0a%3c %0a%3c 51 See Chapter 36 of this Book. %0a%3c %0a%3c 52 We have an amusing proof of this ignorance of Mummius given by %0a%3c Paterculus, B. i. c. 13, who says that when he had the choicest of the %0a%3c Corinthian statues and pictures sent to Italy, he gave notice to the con- %0a%3c tractors that if they lost any of them, they must be prepared to supply new %0a%3c ones.

In the native mass, it has its own proper colour %0a%3c within, but is spotted on the exterior; the ancients made uso %0a%3c of it for tone. 1 * , %0a%3c %0a%3c There are three kinds of sinopis, the red, the pale red, and %0a%3c the intermediate. The price of the best is twelve denarii per %0a%3c pound; it is used both for painting with the brush, and for %0a%3c colouring wood. The kind which comes from Africa sells at %0a%3c eight asses per pound ; the name given to it is " cicerculum." 18 %0a%3c That 17 which is of the deepest red is the most in use for %0a%3c colouring compartitions. The sinopis known as the dull 18 %0a%3c kind, being of a very tawny complexion, sells also at the price %0a%3c of eight asses per pound ; it is used principally for the lower 19 %0a%3c parts of compartitions. %0a%3c %0a%3c Used medicinally, sinopis is of a soothing nature, and is em- %0a%3c ployed as an ingredient in plasters and emollient poultices. %0a%3c It admits of being easily used, whether in the form of a dry %0a%3c or of a liquid composition, for the cure of ulcers situate in the %0a%3c humid parts of the body, the mouth and the rectum, for in- %0a%3c stance. Used as an injection, it arrests looseness of the bowels, %0a%3c and, taken in doses of one denarius, it acts as a check upon %0a%3c female discharges. Applied in a burnt state, with wine in %0a%3c particular, it has a desiccative effect upon granulations of the %0a%3c eyelids. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 14.

It is with this material that they give the under- %0a%3c coating to minium, in the adulteration t)f which it is also ex- %0a%3c tensively employed. %0a%3c %0a%3c In medicine it is very highly esteemed. Applied to the %0a%3c eyes in the form of a liniment, it allays defluxions and pains %0a%3c in those organs, and arrests the discharges from lachrymal %0a%3c fistulas. To persons vomiting blood, it is administered with %0a%3c vinegar to drink. It is taken also internally for affections of %0a%3c the spleen and kidneys ; and by females for the purpose of %0a%3c arresting flooding. It is employed too, to counteract the %0a%3c effects of poisons, and of stings inflicted by sea or land ser- %0a%3c pents ; hence it is that it is so commonly used as an ingredient %0a%3c in antidotes. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 15. — EGYPTIAN EABTH. %0a%3c %0a%3c Of the other kinds of rubrica, those of Egypt and Africa are %0a%3c of the greatest utility to workers in wood, from the fact of %0a%3c their being absorbed with the greatest rapidity.

This was, in fact, one of the varieties of " minium," %0a%3c red oxide of lead, our red lead.

For the purpose of prepar- %0a%3c ing it, argcntaria or silver chalk 57 is dyed along with purple 58 %0a%3c cloth, it imbibing the colour more speedily than the wool. The %0a%3c best of all is that which, being thrown the very first into the %0a%3c boiling cauldron, becomes saturated with the dye in its primi- %0a%3c tive state. The next best in quality is that which has been %0a%3c put into the same liquor, after the first has been removed. %0a%3c Each time that this is done, the quality becomes proportionally %0a%3c deteriorated, owing, of course, to the comparative thinness %0a%3c of the liquid. The reason that the purpurissum of Puteoli %0a%3c is more highly esteemed than that of Tyre, Gaetulia, or Laconia, %0a%3c places which produce the most precious kinds of purple, is thu %0a%3c fact that it combines more readily with hysginum, 69 and that %0a%3c it is made to absorb the colouring liquid of madder. The %0a%3c worst purpurissum is that of Lanuvium. 60 %0a%3c %0a%3c The price of purpurissum is from one to thirty denarii per %0a%3c pound.

Wax, too, is stained with all these colouring substances %0a%3c for encaustic painting ; 76 a process which does not admit of %0a%3c %0a%3c 70 So called, probably, eitber from the place where it was made, or %0a%3c from the person who first discovered it.

The meaning of this pas- %0a%3c sage is obscure.

" ' Cerce,' %0a%3c or ' waxes,' was the ordinary term for painters' colours among the Bo- %0a%3c mans, but more especially encaustic colours, which were probably kept dry %0a%3c in boxes, and the wet brush or pencil was rubbed upon them when colour %0a%3c was required, or they were moistened by the artist previous to commencing %0a%3c work. From the term ' eerie' it would appear that wax constituted the %0a%3c principal ingredient in the colouring vehicle used ; but this does not ne- %0a%3c cessarily follow, and it is very improbable that it did ; there must have %0a%3c been a great portion of gum or resin in the colours, or they could not have %0a%3c hardened. Wax was undoubtedly a most essential ingredient, since it %0a%3c apparently prevents the colours from cracking. ' Cera therefore might %0a%3c originally simply mean colours which contained wax, in contradistinction %0a%3c to those which did not ; but was afterwards applied generally by the Ro- %0a%3c mans to the colours of painters." — Wornum, Smith's Diet.

But at the present da)-, %0a%3c when purple is employed for colouring walls even, and when %0a%3c India sends to us the slime 83 of her rivers, and the corrupt blood %0a%3c of her dragons 84 and her elephants, there is no such thing as a %0a%3c picture of high quality produced. Everything, in fact, was su- %0a%3c perior at a time when the resources of art were so much fewer %0a%3c than they now are. Yes, so it is ; and the reason is, as we %0a%3c %0a%3c 77 Called " Inceramenta navium," in Livy, B. xxviii. c. 45. See also %0a%3c Chapters 39 and 41 of this Book. %0a%3c %0a%3c 78 Pliny here commits a mistake, which, may have arisen from an imper- %0a%3c fect recollection, as Sir. H. Davy has supposed, of a passage in Cicero %0a%3c (Brutus, c. 18), which, however, quite contradicts the statement of Pliny. %0a%3c " In painting, we admire in the works of Zeuxis, Polygnotus, Timanthes, %0a%3c and those who \ised four colours only, the figure and the lineaments; but %0a%3c in the works of Echion, Nicomachus, Protogenes, and Apelles, everything %0a%3c is perfect." Indeed Pliny contradicts himself, for he speaks of two others %0a%3c colours used by the earliest painters, the testa trita, or ground earthenware, %0a%3c in Chapter 5 of this Book; and " cinnabaris," or vermilion, in B. xxxiii. %0a%3c c. 36. Also, in Chapter 21 of this Book he speaks of Eretrian earth as %0a%3c having been used by Nicomachus, and in Chapter 25 of ivory black as %0a%3c having been invented by Apelles. %0a%3c %0a%3c 79 These painters will all be noticed in Chapter 36. %0a%3c %0a%3c eo See Chapter 19 of this Book, 81 See B. xxxiii. c. 56. %0a%3c %0a%3c 82 Blue is here excluded altogether, unless under the term " atramen- %0a%3c tum" we would include black and blue indicum, or in other words, Indian %0a%3c ink and indigo. 83 See Chapter 27 of this Book. %0a%3c %0a%3c 81 In ailusion to Dragon's blood."

The Emperor Nero ordered a painting of him- %0a%3c self to be executed upon canvass, of colossal proportions, one %0a%3c hundred and twenty feet in height ; a thing till then un- %0a%3c known. 86 This picture was just completed when it was burnt %0a%3c by lightning, with the greater part of the gardens of Haius, %0a%3c in which it was exhibited. %0a%3c %0a%3c A freedman of the same prince, on the occasion of his ex- %0a%3c hibiting a show of gladiators at Antium, had the public por- %0a%3c ticos hung, as everybody knows, with paintings, in which %0a%3c were represented genuine portraits of the gladiators and all %0a%3c the other assistants. Indeed, at this place, there has been a %0a%3c very prevailing taste for paintings for many ages past. C. %0a%3c Terentius Lucanus was the first who had combats of gladiators %0a%3c painted for public exhibition : in honour of his grandfather, %0a%3c who had adopted him, he provided thirty pairs of gladiators %0a%3c in the Forum, for three consecutive days, and exhibited a %0a%3c painting of their combats in the Grove of Diana. 87 %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 34. (8.) — THE AGE OF PAINTING ; WITH THE NAMES OF %0a%3c THE MORE CELEBRATED WORKS AND ARTISTS, FOUR HUNDRED %0a%3c AND FIVE IN NUMBER. %0a%3c %0a%3c I shall now proceed to enumerate, as briefly as possible, the %0a%3c more eminent among the painters ; it not being consistent with %0a%3c the plan of this work to go into any great lengths of detail. %0a%3c It must suffice therefore, in some cases, to name the artist in a %0a%3c cursory manner only, and with reference to the account given of %0a%3c others ; with the exception, of course, of the more famous pro- %0a%3c 85 In Chapter 2 of this Book. %0a%3c %0a%3c 66 From the construction of the passage, it is difficult to say whether he %0a%3c means to say that such colossal figures were till then unknown in paint- %0a%3c ing, or whether that the use of canvass in painting was till then unknown. %0a%3c If the latter is the meaning, it is not exactly correct, though it is probable %0a%3c that the introduction of canvass for this purpose was comparatively late ; %0a%3c there being no mention of its being employed by the Greek painters of the %0a%3c best periods. %0a%3c %0a%3c „ 87 See B. iii. c.9, B. xiv. c. 3, and B. xvi. c. 91. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 34.] THE NAMES OF CELEBEATED PATNTEE9. 247 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ductions of the pictorial art, whether still in existence or %0a%3c now lost, all of which it will be only right to take some notice %0a%3c of. In this department, the ordinary exactness of the Greeks %0a%3c has been somewhat inconsistent, in placing the painters so %0a%3c many Olympiads after the statuaries and toreutic 88 artists, and %0a%3c the veiy first of them so late as the ninetieth Olympiad ; seeing %0a%3c that Phidias himself is said to have been originally a painter, %0a%3c and that there was a shield at Athens which had been painted %0a%3c by him : in addition to which, it is universally agreed that in %0a%3c the eighty-third Olympiad, his brother Pansenus 89 painted, at %0a%3c Elis, 90 the interior of the shield of Minerva, which had been %0a%3c executed by Colotes, 91 a disciple of Phidias and his assistant %0a%3c in the statue of the Olympian Jupiter. 92 And then besides, is it %0a%3c not equally admitted that Candaules, the last Lydian king of the %0a%3c race of the Heraclidae, very generally known also by the name %0a%3c of Myrsilus, paid its weight in gold for a picture by the painter %0a%3c Bularchus, 93 which represented the battle fought by him with %0a%3c the Magnetes ? so great was the estimation in which the art %0a%3c was already held. This circumstance must of necessity have %0a%3c happened about the period of our Romulus ; for it was in the %0a%3c eighteenth Olympiad that Candaules perished, or, as some %0a%3c writers say, in the same year as the death of Romulus: a thing %0a%3c which clearly demonstrates that even at that early period the %0a%3c art had already become famous, and had arrived at a state of %0a%3c great perfection. %0a%3c %0a%3c If, then, we are bound to admit this conclusion, it must be %0a%3c equally evident that the commencement of the art is of much %0a%3c earlier date, and that those artists who painted in mono- %0a%3c chrome, 91 and whose dates have not been handed down to us, %0a%3c must have flourished at even an anterior period ; Hygiaenon, %0a%3c namely, Dinias, Charmadas, 95 Eumarus, of Athens, the first who %0a%3c %0a%3c 68 " Toreutae."

On the first occasion, Panaenus him- %0a%3c self entered the lists, at the Pythian Games, with Timagoras %0a%3c of Chalcis, by whom he was defeated ; a circumstance which %0a%3c is recorded in some ancient lines by Timagoras himself, and %0a%3c an undoubted proof that the chroniclers are in error as to %0a%3c %0a%3c 58 It is pretty clear, from vases of a very ancient date, that it is not tlie %0a%3c sexual distinction that is here alluded to. Eumarus, perhaps, may have been %0a%3c the first to give to each sex its characteristic style of design, in the com- %0a%3c positions, draperies, attitudes, and complexions of the respective sexes. %0a%3c Wornum thinks that, probably, Eumarus, and certainly, Cimon, belonged %0a%3c to the class of ancient tetrachromists, or polychromists, painting in a va- %0a%3c riety of colours, without a due, or at least a partial, observance of the %0a%3c laws of light and shade.

After these, and yet %0a%3c before the ninetieth Olympiad, there were other celebrated %0a%3c painters, Polygnotus of Thasos, 1 for instance, who was the %0a%3c first to paint females in transparent drapery, and to represent %0a%3c the head covered with a parti-coloured head-dress. He, too, %0a%3c was the first to contribute many other improvements to the %0a%3c art of painting, opening the mouth, for example, showing the %0a%3c teeth, and throwing expression into the countenance, in place %0a%3c of the ancient rigidity of the features. %0a%3c %0a%3c There is a picture by this artist in the Portico 2 of Pompeius, %0a%3c before the Curia that was built by him ; with reference to %0a%3c which, there is some doubt whether the man represented with %0a%3c a shield is in the act of ascending or descending. He also %0a%3c embellished the Temple 3 at Delphi, and at Athens the Portico %0a%3c known as the Pcecile ; 4 at which last he worked gratuitously, %0a%3c in conjunction with Micon, 5 who received pay for his labours. %0a%3c Indeed Polygnotus was held in the higher esteem of the two ; %0a%3c for the Amphictyons, 6 who form the general Council of Greece, %0a%3c decreed that he should have his lodging furnished him at the %0a%3c public expense. %0a%3c %0a%3c There was also another Micon, distinguished from the first %0a%3c Micon by the surname of "the younger," and whose daughter %0a%3c Timarete 7 also practised the art of painting. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 36. AETISTS WHO PAINTED WITH THE PENCIL. %0a%3c %0a%3c In the ninetieth Olympiad lived Aglaophon, 8 Cephisodorus, %0a%3c Erillus, and Evenor, the father of Parrhasius, one of the %0a%3c %0a%3c 1 See B. vii. c. 57. (Vol. II. p. 233), where he is mentioned as an Athe- %0a%3c nian. It is not improbable that he became a^citizen of Athens in the seventy- %0a%3c ninth Olympiad, b.c. 463, when Thasos was brought under the power of %0a%3c Athens, and, as Sillig suggests, at the solicitation of Cimon, the son of %0a%3c Miltiades. It is generally supposed that he flourished about the eightieth %0a%3c Olympiad. %0a%3c %0a%3c ' l Belonging to the Theatre of Pompey, in the Ninth Begion of the City. %0a%3c %0a%3c 3 "With scenes from the Trojan War, and the adventures of Ulysses. %0a%3c %0a%3c * Or " Variegated ;" from its various pictures. 5 See B. xxxiii. c. 56. %0a%3c %0a%3c 6 See B. vii. c. 37. 7 She is again mentioned in Chapter 40. %0a%3c %0a%3c 8 He was a native of Thasos, and father and instructor of Polygnotus. %0a%3c As Pliny has already stated that Polygnotus flourished before the ninetieth %0a%3c Olympiad, there is an inconsistency in his making mention of the son as %0a%3c flourishing before the father. Hence Sillig, with Bottiger, is inclined to %0a%3c think that there were two artists of this name, one about the seventieth, %0a%3c and the other about the ninetieth Olympiad, the former being the father %0a%3c of Polygnotus. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 250 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c PLINY'S NATURAL HISTORY. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XXXV. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c greatest of painters, and of whom we shall have to speak %0a%3c when we come to the period at which he flourished. All %0a%3c these were artists of note, but not sufficiently so to detain us %0a%3c by any further details, in our haste to arrive at the luminaries %0a%3c of the art ; first among whom shone Apollodorus of Athens, %0a%3c in the ninety-third Olympiad. He was the first to paint %0a%3c objects as they really appeared ; the first too, we may justly %0a%3c say, to confer glory 9 by the aid of the pencil. 10 Of this artist %0a%3c there is a Priest in Adoration, and an Ajax struck by Light- %0a%3c ning, a work to be seen at Pergamus at the present day : %0a%3c before him, there is no painting of any artist now to be seen %0a%3c which has the power of rivetting the eye. %0a%3c %0a%3c The gates of art being now thrown open by Apollodorus, %0a%3c Zeuxis of Heraclea 11 entered upon the scene, in the fourth year %0a%3c of the ninety-fifth Olympiad, destined to lead the pencil — for %0a%3c it is of the pencil that we are still speaking — a pencil for %0a%3c which there was nothing too arduous, to a very high pitch of %0a%3c glory. By some writers he is erroneously placed in the %0a%3c eighty-ninth Olympiad, a date that must of necessity be re- %0a%3c served for Demophilus of Himera and Neseus of Thasos, of %0a%3c one of whom, it is uncertain which, Zeuxis was the pupil. %0a%3c It was in reference to him that Apollodorus, above-mentioned, %0a%3c wrote a verse to the effect, that Zeuxis had stolen the art %0a%3c from others and had taken it all to himself. 12 Zeuxis also %0a%3c acquired such a vast amount of wealth, that, in a spirit of %0a%3c ostentation, he went so far as to parade himself at Olyrapia %0a%3c with his name embroidered on the checked pattern of his %0a%3c garments in letters of gold. At a later period, he came to the %0a%3c %0a%3c 9 " Primusque gloriam penicillo jure contulit." Wornum considers %0a%3c that " the ricli effect of the combination of light and shade with colour is %0a%3c clearly expressed in these words." — Smith's Diet. Antiq. Art.

Thus, for instance, %0a%3c he gave an Alcmena to the people of Agrigentum, and a Pan %0a%3c to Archelaus. 13 He also painted a Penelope, in which the %0a%3c peculiar character of that matron appears to be delineated to %0a%3c the very life ; and a figure of an athlete, with which he was %0a%3c so highly pleased, that he wrote beneath it the line which has %0a%3c since become so famous, to the effect that it would be easier %0a%3c to find fault with him than to imitate him. 14 His Jupiter %0a%3c seated on the throne, with the other Deities standing around %0a%3c him, is a magnificent production : the same, too, with his %0a%3c Infant Hercules strangling the Dragons, in presence of Am- %0a%3c phitryon and his mother Alcmena, who is struck with horror. %0a%3c Still, however, Zeuxis is generally censured for making the %0a%3c heads and articulations of his figures out of proportion. And %0a%3c yet, so scrupulously careful was he, that on one occasion, when %0a%3c he was about to execute a painting for the people of Agri- %0a%3c gentum, 15 to be consecrated in the Temple of the Lacinian %0a%3c Juno there, he had the young maidens of the place stripped %0a%3c for examination, and selected five of them, in order to adopt %0a%3c in his picture the most commendable points in the form of %0a%3c each. He also painted some monochromes in white. 16 %0a%3c %0a%3c The contemporaries and rivals of Zeuxis were Timanthes, %0a%3c Androcydes, Eupompus, and Parrhasius. (10.) This last, it %0a%3c is said, entered into a pictorial contest with Zeuxis, who %0a%3c represented some grapes, painted so naturally that the birds %0a%3c flew towards the spot where the picture was exhibited. %0a%3c Parrhasius, on the other hand, exhibited a curtain, drawn with %0a%3c such singular truthfulness, that Zeuxis, elated with the %0a%3c judgment which had been passed upon his work by the birds, %0a%3c haughtily demanded that the curtain should be drawn aside to %0a%3c let the picture be seen. Upon finding his mistake, with a great %0a%3c degree of ingenuous candour he admitted that he had been %0a%3c surpassed, for that whereas he himself had only deceived the %0a%3c birds, Parrhasius had deceived him, an artist. %0a%3c %0a%3c 13 King of Macedonia. %0a%3c %0a%3c 14 MwfiT)%3cTfTai ne /taXXov ij fiifir}%3cnrai.

[Book XXXV. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c There is a story, too, that at a later period, Zeuxis having %0a%3c painted a child carrying grapes, the birds came to peck at them ; %0a%3c upon which, with a similar degree of candour, he expressed %0a%3c himself vexed with his work, and exclaimed — " I have surely %0a%3c painted the grapes better than the child, for if I had fully %0a%3c succeeded in the last, the birds would have been in fear of %0a%3c it." Zeuxis executed some figures also in clay, 17 the only %0a%3c works of art that were left behind at Ambracia, when Fulvius %0a%3c Nobilior 18 transported the Muses from that city to Home. There %0a%3c is at Rome a Helena by Zeuxis, in the Porticos of Philippus, 19 %0a%3c and a Marsyas Bound, in the Temple of Concord 20 there. %0a%3c %0a%3c Parrhasius of Ephesus also contributed greatly to the pro- %0a%3c gress of painting, being the first to give symmetry to his %0a%3c figures, the first to give play and expression to the features, %0a%3c elegance to the hair, and gracefulness to the mouth : indeed, %0a%3c for contour, it is universally admitted by artists that he bore %0a%3c away the palm. This, in painting, is the very highest point %0a%3c of skill. To paint substantial bodies and the interior of %0a%3c objects is a great thing, no doubt, but at the same time it is a %0a%3c point in which many have excelled : but to make the extreme %0a%3c outline of the figure, to give the finishing touches to the %0a%3c painting in rounding off the contour, this is a point of success %0a%3c in the art which is but rarely attained. For the extreme %0a%3c outline, to be properly executed, requires to be nicely rounded, %0a%3c and so to terminate as to prove the existence of something %0a%3c more behind it, and thereby disclose that which it also serves %0a%3c to hide. %0a%3c %0a%3c Such is the merit conceded to Parrhasius by Antigonus 21 %0a%3c and Xenocrates, 22 who have written on the art of painting; %0a%3c and in this as well as in other points, not only do they admit %0a%3c his excellence, but enlarge upon it in terms of the highest %0a%3c commendation. There are many pen sketches by him still in %0a%3c existence, both upon panel and on parchment, from the study %0a%3c of which, even artists, it is said, may greatly profit. %0a%3c %0a%3c Notwithstanding these points of excellence, however, Parr- %0a%3c hasius seems comparatively inferior to himself in giving the %0a%3c %0a%3c 17 " Figlina opera."

In his alle- %0a%3c gorical picture of the People of Athens, he has displayed %0a%3c singular ingenuity in the treatment of his subject ; for in %0a%3c representing it, he had to depict it as at once fickle, choleric, %0a%3c unjust, and versatile ; while, again, he hfed equally to show its %0a%3c attributes of implacability 23 and clemency, compassionateness %0a%3c and pride, loftiness and humility, fierceness and timidity — %0a%3c and all these at once. He painted a Theseus also, which was %0a%3c formerly in the Capitol at Rome, a Naval Commander 24 wear- %0a%3c ing a cuirass, and, in one picture, now at Ehodes, figures of %0a%3c Meleager, Hercules, and Perseus. This last painting, though %0a%3c it has been thrice struek by lightning, has escaped being %0a%3c effaced, a circumstance which tends to augment the admira- %0a%3c tion which it naturally excites. He painted an Archi- %0a%3c gallus 25 also, a picture which the Emperor Tiberius greatly %0a%3c admired. According to Deculo, 26 that prince had it shut up in %0a%3c his chamber, the price at which it was valued being six %0a%3c hundred thousand sesterces. %0a%3c %0a%3c Parrhasius also painted a Thracian Nurse, with an Infant %0a%3c in her arms, a Philiscus, 27 a Father Liber 28 attended by Virtue, %0a%3c Two Children, in which Ave see pourtrayed the careless-sim- %0a%3c plicity of childhood, and a Priest attended by a Boy, with a %0a%3c censer and chaplet. There are also two most noble pictures %0a%3c by him ; one of which represents a Runner 29 contending for the %0a%3c prize, completely armed, so naturally depicted that he has all %0a%3c the appearauce of sweating. In the other we see the Runner %0a%3c taking off his armour, and can fancy that we hear him panting %0a%3c aloud for breath. His iEneas, Castor, and Pollux, all represented %0a%3c in the same picture, are highly praised ; his Telephus also, %0a%3c and his Achilles, Agamemnou, and Ulysses. %0a%3c %0a%3c Parrhasius was a most prolific artist, but at the same time %0a%3c there was no one who enjoyed the glory conferred upon him by %0a%3c his talent with greater insolence and arrogance.

But above all %0a%3c things, it was a boast? with him that he had sprung from the %0a%3c lineage of Apollo, and that he had painted his Hercules, a %0a%3c picture now at Lindos, just as he had often seen him in his %0a%3c sleep. It was in this spirit, too, that upon being defeated by %0a%3c Timanthes, at Samos, by a great majority of votes, the subject %0a%3c of the picture being Ajax and the Award of the Arms, 31 he %0a%3c declared, in the name of his hero, that he felt himself quite %0a%3c disgraced on thus seeing himself a second time defeated by an %0a%3c unworthy opponent. He painted also some smaller pictures of %0a%3c an immodest nature, indulging his leisure in such prurient %0a%3c fancies as these. 32 %0a%3c %0a%3c As to Timanthes, 33 he was an artist highly gifted with %0a%3c genius, and loud have some of the orators 34 been in their com- %0a%3c mendations of his Iphigenia, represented as she stands at the %0a%3c altar awaiting her doom. Upon the countenance of all pre- %0a%3c sent, that of her uncle 35 in particular, grief was depicted ; but %0a%3c having already exhausted all the characteristic features of %0a%3c sorrow, the artist adopted the device of veiling the features %0a%3c of the victim's father, 36 finding himself unable adequately to %0a%3c give expression to his feelings. There are also some other %0a%3c proofs of his genius, a Sleeping Cyclops, for instance, which he %0a%3c has painted upon a small panel ; but, being desirous to convey an %0a%3c idea of his gigantic stature, he has painted some Satyrs near %0a%3c him measuring his thumb with a thyrsus. Indeed, Timanthes %0a%3c is the only one among the artists in whose works there is %0a%3c always something more implied by the pencil than is expressed, %0a%3c and whose execution, though of the very highest quality, is %0a%3c always surpassed by the inventiveness of his genius.

There is by Eupompus, a Victor in a %0a%3c gymnastic contest, holding a palm. So high was the reputa- %0a%3c tion of this artist, that he established a school of painting, and %0a%3c so divided the art into three styles; whereas till then there had %0a%3c been but two, known respectively as the Helladic 39 and the %0a%3c Asiatic. In honour of him, a native of Sicyon by birth, the %0a%3c Helladic school was divided into two, and from this period %0a%3c there were three distinct styles recognized, the Ionic, the %0a%3c Sicyonian, and the Attic. %0a%3c %0a%3c We have, by Pamphilus, 40 a picture representing the Alliance %0a%3c and the Battle that was fought at Phlius ; 41 the Victory 42 also %0a%3c that was gained by the Athenians, and a representation of %0a%3c Ulysses in his ship. He was a Macedonian by birth, but was %0a%3c the first painter who was also skilled in all the other sciences, %0a%3c arithmetic and geometry more particularly, without the aid of %0a%3c which he maintained that the pictorial art could not attain %0a%3c perfection. He gave instruction to no one for a smaller sum %0a%3c than one talent, at the rate of five hundred denarii per %0a%3c annum, 43 and this fee both Apelles and Melanthius paid. It %0a%3c was through his influence that, first at Sicyon, and then %0a%3c throughout the whole of Greece, all children of free birth were %0a%3c taught the graphic 44 art, or in other words, the art of depicting %0a%3c upon boxwood, before all others ; in consequence of which this %0a%3c came to be looked upon as the first step in the liberal arts.

Hence it is, that neither in painting nor in the %0a%3c toreutic 45 art has there been any celebrated work executed by %0a%3c a slave. %0a%3c %0a%3c In the hundred and seventh Olympiad, flourished Aetion and %0a%3c Therimachus. 46 By the former we have some fine pictures; a %0a%3c Father Liber, 47 Tragedy and Comedy, Semiramis from the rank %0a%3c of a slave elevated to the throne, an Old "Woman bearing %0a%3c torches, and a New-made Bride, remarkable for the air of %0a%3c modesty with which she is pourtrayed. %0a%3c %0a%3c But it was Apelles 49 of Cos, in the hundred and twelfth %0a%3c Olympiad, who surpassed all the other painters who either %0a%3c preceded or succeeded him. Single-handed, he contributed %0a%3c more to painting than all the others together, and even went %0a%3c so far as to publish some treatises on the principles of the art. %0a%3c The great point of artistic merit with himwas his singular charm %0a%3c of gracefulness, 50 and this too, though the greatest of painters %0a%3c were his contemporaries. In admiring their works and be- %0a%3c stowing high eulogiums upon them, he used to say that there %0a%3c was still wanting in them that ideal of beauty 51 so peculiar to %0a%3c himself, and known to the Greeks as " Charis ;" 52 others, he said, %0a%3c had acquired all the other requisites of perfection, but in this one %0a%3c point he himself had no equal. He also asserted his claim to %0a%3c another great point of merit : admiring a picture by Protogenes, %0a%3c which bore evident marks of unbounded laboriousness and the %0a%3c most minute finish, he remarked that in every respect Proto- %0a%3c genes was fully his equal, or perhaps his superior, except in %0a%3c this, that he himself knew when to take his hand off a %0a%3c picture— a memorable lesson, which teaches us that over- %0a%3c carefulness may be productive of bad results.

The latter was living at Rhodes, %0a%3c when Apelles disembarked there, desirous of seeing the works %0a%3c of a man whom he had hitherto only known by reputation. %0a%3c Accordingly, he repaired at once to the studio ; Protogenes %0a%3c was not at home, but there happened to be a large panel %0a%3c upon the easel ready for painting, with an old woman who %0a%3c was left in charge. To his enquiries she made answer, that %0a%3c Protogenes was not at home, and then asked whom she %0a%3c should name as the visitor. ." Here he is," was the reply of %0a%3c Apelles, and seizing a brush, he traced with colour upon the %0a%3c panel an outline of a singularly minute fineness. Upon his %0a%3c return, the old woman mentioned to Protogenes what had %0a%3c happened. The artist, it is said, upon remarking the delicacy %0a%3c of the touch, instantly exclaimed that Apelles must have been %0a%3c the visitor, for that no other person was capable of executing %0a%3c anything so exquisitely perfect. So saying, he traced within %0a%3c the same outline a still finer outline, but with another colour, %0a%3c and then took his departure, with instructions to the woman %0a%3c to show it to the stranger, if he returned, and to let him know %0a%3c that this was the person whom he had come to see. It hap- %0a%3c pened as he anticipated ; Apelles returned, and vexed at find- %0a%3c ing himself thus surpassed, he took up another colour and split 53 %0a%3c both of the outlines, leaving no possibility of anything finer being %0a%3c executed. Upon seeing this, Protogenes admitted that he was %0a%3c defeated, and at once flew to the harbour to look for his guest. %0a%3c %0a%3c M " Secuit."

Judging from the words used by %0a%3c Apelles and Protogenes, each in his message, it is not unlikely that the %0a%3c " linea" or outline drawn by each was a profile of himself, and that the %0a%3c profile of Protogenes was drawn within that of Apelles ; who, on the %0a%3c second occasion, drew a third profile between the other two, but with a still %0a%3c finer line than either of them. In Dr. Smith's Dictionary of Biography, %0a%3c art Apelles, it is thus explained : « The most natural explanation of this %0a%3c difficult passage seems to be, that down the middle of the first line i of %0a%3c Apelles Protogenes drew another, so as to divide it into two parallel %0a%3c halves, 'and that Apelles again divided the line of Protogenes in the same %0a%3c manner." %0a%3c %0a%3c VOL.

I am told that it was %0a%3c burnt in the first fire which took place at Caesar's palace on %0a%3c the Palatine Hill ; but in former times I have often stopped %0a%3c to admire it. Upon its vast surface it contained nothing %0a%3c whatever except the three outlines, so remarkably fine as to %0a%3c escape the sight : among the most elaborate works of numerous %0a%3c other artists it had all the appearance of a blank space ; and %0a%3c yet by that very fact it attracted the notice of every one, and %0a%3c was held in higher estimation than any other painting there. %0a%3c %0a%3c It was a custom with Apelles, to which he most tenaciously %0a%3c adhered, never to let any day pass, however busy he might be, %0a%3c without exercising himself by tracing some outline or other ; a %0a%3c practice which has now passed into a proverb. 51 It was also %0a%3c a practice with him, when he had completed a work, to exhibit %0a%3c it to the view of the passers-by in some exposed place ; 55 while %0a%3c he himself, concealed behind the picture, would listen to the %0a%3c criticisms that were passed upon it ; it being his opinion that %0a%3c the judgment of the public was preferable to his own, as being %0a%3c the more discerning of the two. It was under ti#ese circum- %0a%3c stances, they say, that he was censured by a shoemaker for %0a%3c having represented the shoes with one shoe-string too little. %0a%3c The next day, the shoemaker, quite proud at seeing tflfe former %0a%3c error corrected, thanks to his advice, began to criticize the %0a%3c leg ; upon which Apelles, full of indignation, popped his head %0a%3c out, and reminded him that a shoemaker should give no opinion %0a%3c beyond the shoes, a piece of advice which has equally passed into %0a%3c a proverbial saying. 56 In fact, Apelles was a person of great %0a%3c amenity of manners, a circumstance which rendered him par- %0a%3c ticularly agreeable to Alexander the Great, who would often %0a%3c come to his studio. He had forbidden himself, by public edict, %0a%3c as already stated, 57 to be represented by any other artist. On %0a%3c one occasion, however, when the prince was in his studio, %0a%3c talking a great deal about painting without knowing anything %0a%3c about it, Apelles quietly begged that he would quit the sub- %0a%3c %0a%3c 51 The Latin form of which, as given hy Erasmus, is " Nulla dies aheat, %0a%3c quia linea ducta supersit."

And yet irascible as he was, %0a%3c Alexander conferred upon him a very signal mark of the high %0a%3c estimation in which he held him ; for having, in his admira- %0a%3c tion of her extraordinary beauty, engaged Apelles to paint %0a%3c Pancaste undraped, 58 the most beloved of all his concubines, %0a%3c the artist while so engaged, fell in love with her ; upon which, %0a%3c Alexander, perceiving this to be the case, made him a present %0a%3c of her, thus showing himself, though a great king in courage, %0a%3c a still greater one in self-command, this action redounding no %0a%3c les3 to his honour than any of his victories. For in thus con- %0a%3c quering himself, not only did he sacrifice his passions in %0a%3c favour of the artist, but even his affections as well ; unin- %0a%3c fluenced, too, by the feelings which must have possessed his fa- %0a%3c vourite in thus passing at once from the arms of a monarch to %0a%3c those of a painter. Some persons are of opinion that Pancaste %0a%3c was the model of Apelles in his painting of Venus Anadyomene. 59 %0a%3c %0a%3c It was Apelles too, who, courteous even to his rivals, first %0a%3c established the reputation of Protogenes at Rhodes. Held as %0a%3c he was in little estimation by his own fellow-countrymen, %0a%3c a thing that generally 60 is the case, Apelles enquired of him %0a%3c what price he set upon certain finished works of his, which %0a%3c he had on hand. TJpon Protogenes mentioning some very %0a%3c trifling sum or other, Apelles made him an offer of fifty talents, %0a%3c and then circulated a report that he was buying these works %0a%3c in order to sell them as his own. By this contrivance, he %0a%3c aroused the Ehodians to a better appreciation of the merits %0a%3c of their artist, and only consented to leave the pictures with %0a%3c them upon their offering a still larger price. %0a%3c %0a%3c He painted portraits, too, so exactly to the life, that a fact %0a%3c with which we are made acquainted by the writings of Apion %0a%3c the grammarian seems altogether incredible.

Apelles %0a%3c had been on bad terms with Ptolemaeus in former times, when %0a%3c they formed part of the suite of Alexander. After Ptokmaeus %0a%3c had become king of Egypt, it so happened that Apelles was %0a%3c driven by the violence of a tempest to Alexandria. Upon this, %0a%3c some of his rivals fraudulently suborned a jester, who was at- %0a%3c tached to the court, to carry him an invitation to dine with the %0a%3c king. Accordingly, Apelles attended ; upon which Ptolemaeus %0a%3c was highly indignant, and, summoning before him his stewards 6 * %0a%3c of the household, requested that the artist would point out the %0a%3c one that had given him the invitation. Thus challenged, %0a%3c Apelles seized a piece of quenched charcoal that lay in the %0a%3c fire-place, and traced a likeness upon the wall, with such ex- %0a%3c actness, that the king, the moment he began it, recognized the %0a%3c features as those of the jester. He also painted a portrait of %0a%3c King Antigonus ; 63 and as that monarch was blind of one eye, he %0a%3c invented a method of concealing the defect. "With this object, %0a%3c he painted him in profile, in order that what in reality was %0a%3c wanting to the person might have the semblance of being %0a%3c wanting to the picture rather, he making it his care to show %0a%3c that side of the face only which he could show without any %0a%3c defect. Among his works, too, there are some figures repre- %0a%3c senting persons at the point of death ; but it is not easy to say %0a%3c which of his productions are of the highest order of excellence. %0a%3c %0a%3c His Venus Rising from the Sea, known as the Venus Anady- %0a%3c omene, 64 was consecrated by the late Emperor Augustus in the %0a%3c Temple 65 of his father 66 Ceesar ; a work which has been cele- %0a%3c %0a%3c 61 « Physiognomists." %0a%3c %0a%3c 62 " Vocatores" — more literally, his " inviting officers." %0a%3c %0a%3c 63 Strabo mentions a portrait of Antigonus in the possession of the %0a%3c inhabitants of Cos. %0a%3c %0a%3c 61 See Note 59 above.

Time, however, %0a%3c and damp at last effaced the painting, and Nero, in his reign, %0a%3c had it replaced by a copy, painted by the hand of Dorotheus. 69 %0a%3c Apelles also commenced another Venus for the people of Cos, 70 %0a%3c which would have outshone even the former one ; but death %0a%3c invidiously prevented its completion, nor could any one be %0a%3c found to complete the work in conformity with the sketches of %0a%3c the outline. He painted also, in the Temple of Diana at %0a%3c Ephesus, Alexander the Great wielding the Thunderbolts, a %0a%3c picture for which he received twenty talents of gold.

The price %0a%3c paid in golden coin for this picture was ascertained by weight, 73 %0a%3c there being no specific sum agreed upon. %0a%3c %0a%3c He also painted a Procession of the Megabyzus, 73 the priest %0a%3c of Diana at Ephesus ; and a Clitus 74 on Horseback, hasten- %0a%3c ing to the combat, his Armour-bearer handing him his helmet %0a%3c at his command.

Aristides also painted a Battle with the Per- %0a%3c sians, a picture which contained one hundred figures, tor each %0a%3c of which he was paid at the rate of ten minae by Mnason, the %0a%3c tyrant of Elatea." 9 He also painted Chariots with four horses %0a%3c in full career ; a Suppliant, which almost speaks, Huntsmen %0a%3c with game ; Leontion, the mistress of Epicurus ; the Anapau- %0a%3c omene, 80 a damsel pining to death from love for her brother ; %0a%3c a Father Liber 91 also, and an Artamene, two fine pictures now %0a%3c to be seen in the Temple of Ceres 92 at Rome ; a Tragedian and %0a%3c a Child, in the Temple of Apollo, 93 a picture which has lost its %0a%3c beauty, owing to the unskilfulness of the painter to whom M. %0a%3c Junius, the praetor, entrusted the cleaning of it, about the %0a%3c period of the Apollinarian Games. 91 There Was also to be %0a%3c seen, in the Temple of Faith, in the Capitol, a picture of his, %0a%3c representing an Aged Man giving instructions to a Child on %0a%3c the lyre. He executed also a painting of an Invalid, upon %0a%3c ■which endless encomiums have been lavished.

Of all his compositions, however, the %0a%3c palm has been awarded to his Ialysus, 1 now at Pome, con- %0a%3c secrated in the Temple of Peace there. So long as he was at %0a%3c work upon it, he lived, it is said, upon nothing but soaked %0a%3c lupines ; by which means he at once appeased both hunger and %0a%3c thirst, and avoided all risk of blunting his perception by too %0a%3c delicate a diet. In order to protect this picture against the effects %0a%3c of ill-usage and old agef he painted it over four times, 2 so that %0a%3c when an upper coat might fail, there would be an under one to %0a%3c succeed it. There is in this picture the figure of a dog, %0a%3c which was completed in a very remarkable manner, inasmuch %0a%3c as accident had an equal share with design in the execution of %0a%3c it. The painter was of opinion that he had not given the %0a%3c proper expression to the foam at the mouth of the animal, %0a%3c panting for breath, as it was represented ; while, with all %0a%3c other parts of the picture, a thing extremely difficult with him, %0a%3c he was perfectly satisfied. The thing that displeased him was, %0a%3c the evident traces of art in the execution of it, touches which %0a%3c did not admit of any diminution, and yet had all the appear- %0a%3c ance of being too laboured, the effect produced being far re- %0a%3c moved from his conception of the reality : the foam, in fact, %0a%3c %0a%3c 97 Or Vestibule. %0a%3c %0a%3c 9S Supposed by Sillig to have been an allegorical painting representing %0a%3c two of the sacred ships of the Athenians ; but to have been mistaken in %0a%3c later times for a picture of Ulysses and Nausicaa, a subject taken from %0a%3c the Odyssey, B. vi. 1. 16, et seq.

Vexed and tormented %0a%3c by this dilemma, it being his wish to depict truth itself, and %0a%3c not something that only bore a semblance of truth, he effaced %0a%3c it again and again, changed his pencil for another, and yet by %0a%3c no possibility could satisfy himself. At last, quite out of tem- %0a%3c per with an art, which, in spite of him, would still obtrude %0a%3c itself, he dashed his sponge against the vexatious spot ; when %0a%3c behold ! the sponge replaced the colours that it had just removed, %0a%3c exactly in accordance with his utmost wishes, and thus did %0a%3c chance represent Nature in a painting. %0a%3c %0a%3c Following his example, Nealces, 3 it is said, succeeded in %0a%3c representing the foam at a horse's mouth ; for on one occasion,, %0a%3c when engaged in painting a man holding in a pair of horses %0a%3c and soothing them with his voice, 4 he also dashed his sponge %0a%3c against the picture, with the view of producing a like effect. %0a%3c %0a%3c It was on account of this Ialysus, which he was apprehen- %0a%3c sive of destroying, that King Demetrius 5 forbore to set fire to %0a%3c the only side of the city of Khodes by which it was capable of %0a%3c being taken ; and thus, in his anxiety to spare a picture, did %0a%3c he lose his only opportunity of gaining a victory. The %0a%3c dwelling of Protogenes at this period was situate in a little %0a%3c garden in the suburbs, or in other words, in the midst of the %0a%3c camp of Demetrius. The combats that were taking place %0a%3c made no difference whatever to the artist, and in no way in- %0a%3c terrupted his proceeding with the works which he had com- %0a%3c menced ; until at last he was summoned before the king, who %0a%3c enquired howhe could have the assurance thus to remain without %0a%3c the walls. "Because I know," was his answer, "that you %0a%3c are waging war with the Rhodians, and not with the arts." %0a%3c Upon this, the king, delighted at having the opportunity of %0a%3c protecting the hand which he had thus spared, ordered a %0a%3c guard to be placed at his disposal for the especial purpose of %0a%3c his protection. In order, too, that he might not distract the %0a%3c artist's attention by sending for him too often, he would often %0a%3c go, an enemy albeit, to pay him a visit, and, abandoning his %0a%3c aspirations for victory, in the midst of arms and the battering %0a%3c down of walls, would attentively examine the compositions of the %0a%3c %0a%3c 3 See Chapter 40 in this Book. %0a%3c %0a%3c 4 " Poppyzonta."

Even to this day, the story is still attached to the %0a%3c picture which lie was then engaged upon, to the effect, that %0a%3c Protogenes painted it beneath the sword. It is his Satyr, %0a%3c known as the " Anapauomenos ;" 6 in whose hand, to mark the %0a%3c sense of security that he felt, the painter has placed a pair of %0a%3c pipes. %0a%3c %0a%3c Protogenes executed also, a Cydippe ; a Tlepolemus ; a %0a%3c portrait of Philiscus, the tragic poet, in an attitude of medi- %0a%3c tation ; an Athlete ; a portrait of King Antigonus, and one of %0a%3c the mother of Aristotle. 7 It was this philosopher too, who %0a%3c advised him to paint the exploits of Alexander the Great, as %0a%3c being certain to be held in everlasting remembrance. The %0a%3c impulse, however, of his natural disposition, combined with a %0a%3c certain artistic caprice, led him in preference to adopt the %0a%3c various subjects which have just been mentioned. His last %0a%3c works were representations of Alexander and the god Pan. %0a%3c He also executed some figures in bronze, as already 8 stated. %0a%3c %0a%3c At the same period also, lived Asclepiodorus, 9 who was %0a%3c greatly admired by Apelles for his proportions. The tyrant %0a%3c Mnason 10 paid him, for his picture of the Twelve Gods, at the %0a%3c rate of thirty minae for each divinity. This same Mnason also %0a%3c paid Theomnestus twenty minae for each of his Heroes. %0a%3c %0a%3c In addition to these, it is only proper to mentionNicomachus, 11 %0a%3c the son and disciple of Aristioeus. He painted a Rape of %0a%3c Proserpina, a picture that was formerly in the Temple of %0a%3c Minerva in the Capitol, above the shrine of Juventas. 12 Another %0a%3c picture of his was to be seen also in the Capitol, placed there by %0a%3c the Poman general Plancus, 13 a Victory soaring aloft in a %0a%3c chariot: he was the first painter who represented Ulysses %0a%3c wearing the pileus. 14 He painted also an Apollo and Liana ; %0a%3c the Mother 16 of the Gods seated on a Lion ; the fine picture %0a%3c of the Bacchantes, witb Satyrs moving stealthily towards %0a%3c %0a%3c 6 " In repose." %0a%3c %0a%3c 7 Phaestis, or Phaestias by name. 8 In B. xxxiv. c. 19. %0a%3c %0a%3c 9 A native of Athens, ranked by Plutarch with Euphranor and Nicias. %0a%3c %0a%3c 10 Tyrant of Elatca, mentioned already in this Chapter.

Among his pupils, were his brother Anston, his %0a%3c son Aristides, and Philoxenus of Eretria, who painted for %0a%3c King Cassander a picture representing one of the battles be- %0a%3c tween Alexander and Darius, a work which may bear com- %0a%3c parison with any. He also painted a picture in grotesque, %0a%3c representing Three Sileni at their revels. Imitating the %0a%3c celerity of execution displayed by his master, he introduced a %0a%3c more sketchy style of painting, executed in a comparatively %0a%3c off-hand manner. 18 %0a%3c %0a%3c To these artists Nicophanes 19 has also been added, an ele- %0a%3c gant and finished painter, to whom for gracefulness few can %0a%3c be compared, but for a severe and tragic style far inferior to %0a%3c Zeuxis or Apelles. Perseus also belongs to this period, a pupil of %0a%3c Apelles, who dedicated to him his work on painting. Aristides %0a%3c of Thebes had for pupils his sons Niceros and Ariston.^ By %0a%3c the latter of these artists, there is a Satyr crowned with a %0a%3c chaplet and holding a goblet : two of his pupils were Anto- %0a%3c rides and Euphranor, of the latter of whom we shall have to %0a%3c make mention again. 20 %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 37. — VARIOUS OTHEB.

His subjects were barbers' shops, cob- %0a%3c blers' stalls, jackasses, eatables, and the like, and to these he was %0a%3c indebted for his epithet of " Bhyparographos." 22 His paintings, %0a%3c however, are exquisitely pleasing, and have sold at higher %0a%3c prices than the very largest works of many masters. %0a%3c %0a%3c On the other hand again, as Yarro tells us, a single picture %0a%3c by Serapio covered the whole space of the balustrades, 23 %0a%3c beneath the Old Shops, 21 where it was exhibited. This artist %0a%3c was very successful in painting stage-scenery, but was unable %0a%3c to depict the human form. Dionysius, 25 on the contrary, %0a%3c painted nothing but men, and hence it was that he had the %0a%3c surname of " Anthropographos." 26 Callicles 27 also painted %0a%3c some small pictures, and Calates executed some small works in %0a%3c the comic style. Both of these styles were adopted by %0a%3c Antiphilus ; 28 who painted a very fine Hesione, and a Philip %0a%3c and Alexander with Minerva, now in the School of the %0a%3c Porticos 29 of Octavia.

Then, %0a%3c too, there are others to be seen fishing, fowling, or gathering %0a%3c in the vintage. In some of his decorations there are fine %0a%3c villas to be seen, and roads to them across the marshes, with %0a%3c women making 39 bargains to be carried across on men's %0a%3c shoulders, who move along slipping at every step and tottering %0a%3c beneath their load ; with numberless other subjects of a %0a%3c similar nature, redolent of mirth and of the most amusing inge- %0a%3c nuity.

For with them, it was not the practice to %0a%3c decorate the walls of houses, for the gratification of the %0a%3c owners only ; nor did they lavish all their resources upon a %0a%3c dwelling which must of necessity always remain a fixture in %0a%3c one spot, and admits of no removal in case of conflagration. %0a%3c Protogenes was content with a cottage in his little garden ; %0a%3c Apelles had no paintings on the plaster of his walls ; it not %0a%3c being the fashion in their day to colour the party-walls of %0a%3c houses from top to bottom. With all those artists, art was %0a%3c ever watchful for the benefit of whole cities only, and in those %0a%3c times a painter was regarded as the common property of all. %0a%3c %0a%3c Shortly before the time of the late Emperor Augustus, %0a%3c Arellius was in high esteem at Kome ; and with fair reason, %0a%3c had he not profaned the art by a disgraceful piece of profanity ; %0a%3c for, being always in love with some woman or other, it was %0a%3c his practice, in painting goddesses, to give them the features of %0a%3c his mistresses ; hence it is, that there were always some figures %0a%3c of prostitutes to be seen in his pictures. More recently, lived %0a%3c Amulius, 41 a grave and serious personage, but a painter in %0a%3c the florid style. By this artist there was a Minerva, which %0a%3c had the appearance of always looking at the spectators, from %0a%3c whatever point it was viewed. He only painted a few hours %0a%3c each day, and then with the greatest gravity, for he always %0a%3c kept the toga on, even when in the midst of his implements. %0a%3c The Golden Palace 42 of .Nero was the prison-house of this %0a%3c artist's productions, and hence it is that there are so few of %0a%3c them to be be seen elsewhere. %0a%3c %0a%3c Next in repute to him were Cornelius Pinus and Attius %0a%3c Priscus, who painted the Temple of Honour and that of %0a%3c Virtue, 43 on their restoration by the Emperor Vespasianus %0a%3c Augustus.

During the Triumvirate, %0a%3c when he was entertained by the magistrates of a certain place, %0a%3c he had lodgings given him in a house that was wholly sur- %0a%3c rounded with trees. The next day, he complained to them in %0a%3c a threatening tone, that he had been unable to sleep for the %0a%3c singing of the birds there. Accordingly, they had a dragon %0a%3c painted, on pieces of parchment of the greatest length that %0a%3c could possibly be obtained, and surrounded the grove with it ; %0a%3c a thing that so terrified the birds, it is said, that they became %0a%3c silent at once ; and hence it was that it first became known %0a%3c how this object could be attained. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 39.

Elasippus too, has inscribed upon a picture of his %0a%3c at iEgina, the word Wi%25a.iv ; 48 a thing that he certainly could %0a%3c not have done, if the art of encaustic paintiDg had not been %0a%3c then invented. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 40.

THE MARVELLOUS PRICE OF SOME PICTURES. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is said, too, that Pamphilus, 49 the instructor of Apelles, not %0a%3c only painted in encaustic, but also instructed Pausias 50 of Sicyon %0a%3c in the art, the first who rendered himself distinguished in this %0a%3c branch. Pausias was the son of Bryetes, by whom he was %0a%3c originally instructed in the art of painting. He retouched %0a%3c also with the pencil 51 some walls at Thespiae, then undergoing %0a%3c repair, which had formerly been painted by Polygnotus. Upon %0a%3c instituting a comparison, however, it was considered that he %0a%3c was greatly inferior, this kind of painting not being in his %0a%3c line. It was he, too, who first thought of painting ceilings : %0a%3c nor had it been the practice before his day to use this kind of %0a%3c decoration for arched roofs. He painted many small pictures %0a%3c also, miniatures of children more particularly ; a thing which, %0a%3c according to the interpretation put upon it by his rivals, was %0a%3c owing to the peculiarly 6low process of encaustic painting. %0a%3c The consequence was, that being determined to give a memo- %0a%3c rable proof of his celerity of execution, he completed a picture %0a%3c in the space of a single day, which was thence called the %0a%3c "Hemeresios," 52 representing the portrait of a child. %0a%3c %0a%3c In his youth, he was enamoured of Glycera, 53 his fellow- %0a%3c townswoman, the first inventor of chaplets ; and in his rivalry %0a%3c of the skill shown by her, he achieved so much success in the %0a%3c encaustic art, as to reproduce the almost numberless tints dis- %0a%3c played by flowers. At a later period, he painted her, seated, %0a%3c with a chaplet on, and thus produced one of the very finest %0a%3c of his pictures ; known as the " Stephaneplocos" 04 by %0a%3c some, and as the " Stephanopolis" 55 by others ; from the circum- %0a%3c stance that Glycera had supported herself in her poverty by %0a%3c selling these chaplets. A copy of this picture, usually known %0a%3c as an " apographon," 66 was purchased by L. Lucullus at Athens, %0a%3c during the festival of the Dionysia, at the price of two talents. %0a%3c %0a%3c Pausias also painted some large pictures, a Sacrifice of Oxen, %0a%3c for instance, which used to be seen in the Portico of Pom- %0a%3c 's See Chapter 36 of tins Book. %0a%3c %0a%3c 80 Two paintings of Lis at Epidaurus are mentioned by Pausanias, B. ii. %0a%3c c. 27. %0a%3c %0a%3c 41 And not in encaustic ; though, as we shall see in Chapter 41, the brush %0a%3c was sometimes used in this branch. 52 The " One day" picture. %0a%3c %0a%3c M See B. xxi. c. 3. « The " Chaplet- wearer."

In this painting he invented several improvements, %0a%3c which many artists have since imitated, but none with the %0a%3c same success. Although in the picture it was particularly his %0a%3c desire to give an impression of the length of the ox, he %0a%3c painted it with a front view and not sideways, and still has %0a%3c caused the large dimensions of the animal to be fully under- %0a%3c stood. And then too, whereas all other painters colour in %0a%3c white such parts as they wish to have the appearance of %0a%3c being prominent, and in black such portions as are intended %0a%3c to remain in the back-ground, he has painted the whole of the %0a%3c ox of a black colour, and has shown the dimensions of .the %0a%3c body which throws the shadow by the medium of the shadow %0a%3c itself ; thus evincing a wonderful degree of skill in showing %0a%3c relief upon a coat painted with a single colour, and conveying %0a%3c an impression of uniform solidity upon a broken ground. 57 It %0a%3c was at Sicyon also that Pausias passed his life, a city which %0a%3c for a long time continued to be the native place of painting. %0a%3c Ultimately, all the paintings belonging to that place were sold %0a%3c by public auction for the discharge of the debts owing by the %0a%3c city, and were transferred to Rome in the sedileship of %0a%3c Scaurus. 68 %0a%3c %0a%3c Next to him, in the hundred and fourth Olympiad, Eu- %0a%3c phranor, 69 the Isthmian, distinguished himself far beyond all %0a%3c others, an artist who has been already mentioned in our %0a%3c account of the statuaries. He executed some colossal figures %0a%3c also, and some statues in marble, and he chased some drinking- %0a%3c vessels ; being studious and laborious in the highest degree, %0a%3c excellent in every branch, and at all times equal to himself. %0a%3c This artist seems to have been the first to represent heroes with %0a%3c becoming dignity, and to have paid particular attention to sym- %0a%3c metry. Still, however, in the generality of instances, he has %0a%3c made the body slight in proportion to the head and limbs. He- %0a%3c composed some treatises also upon symmetry and colours. His %0a%3c works are, an Equestrian Combat ; 60 the Twelve Gods ; and a %0a%3c %0a%3c 57 " In confracto." Meaning probably the group of the surrounding %0a%3c spectators, on which the shadow of the animal's body was thrown.

His prin- %0a%3c cipal glory was his having been the instructor of Nicias 65 of %0a%3c Athens ; who was a most careful painter of female portraits, %0a%3c and a strict observer of light and shade, 65 making it his es- %0a%3c pecial care that the figures in his pictures should appear in %0a%3c the boldest relief. His works are, a Nemea, which was %0a%3c brought from Asia to Home by Silanus, and was placed in %0a%3c the Curia, as already stated; 67 a Father Liber, 68 in the %0a%3c Temple 69 of Concord ; a Hyacinthus, 70 which the Emperor %0a%3c Augustus was so delighted with, that he took it away with %0a%3c him after the capture of Alexandria; for which reason also it %0a%3c was consecrated in the Temple 71 of Augustus by the Emperor %0a%3c Tiberius ; and a Danae. At Ephesus, there is a tomb by %0a%3c him of a megabyzus, 72 or priest of the Ephesian Diana ; and at %0a%3c %0a%3c 61 " Came."

He also executed some large %0a%3c pictures, among which there are a Calypso, an Io, an An- %0a%3c dromeda, a very fine Alexander, in the Porticos' 4 of Pompeius, %0a%3c and a Calypso, seated. To this painter also there are some %0a%3c pictures of cattle attributed, and in his dogs he has been re- %0a%3c markably successful. It was this Nicias, with reference to %0a%3c whom, Praxiteles, when asked with which of all his works in %0a%3c marble he was the best pleased, made answer, " Those to %0a%3c which Nicias has set his hand," so highly did he esteem the %0a%3c colouring of that artist. It has not been satisfactorily ascer- %0a%3c tained whether it is this artist or another of the same name %0a%3c that some writers have placed in the hundred and twelfth %0a%3c Olympiad. %0a%3c %0a%3c With Nicias has been compared, and indeed sometimes %0a%3c preferred to him, Athenion of Maronea, 75 a pupil of Glaucion %0a%3c of Corinth. In his colouring he is more sombre than Nicias, %0a%3c and yet, with all his sombreness, more pleasing ; so much so %0a%3c indeed, that in his paintings shines forth the extensive know- %0a%3c ledge which he possessed of the art. He painted, in the %0a%3c Temple at Eleusis, a Phylarchus ; 76 and at Athens, a family %0a%3c group, which has been known as the " Syngenicon ;" 77 an %0a%3c Achilles also, concealed in a female dress, and Ulysses de- %0a%3c tecting him; a group of six whole-length figures, in one %0a%3c picture ; and, a work which has contributed to his fame more %0a%3c than any other, a Groom leading a Horse. Indeed, if he had %0a%3c not died young, there would have been no one comparable to %0a%3c Athenion in painting. %0a%3c %0a%3c Heraclides, too, of Macedon, had some repute as an artist. %0a%3c At first he was a painter of ships, but afterwards, on the cap- %0a%3c ture of King Perseus, he removed to Athens ; where at the %0a%3c same period was also Metrodorus, 78 who was both a painter %0a%3c and a philosopher, and of considerable celebrity in both %0a%3c _ 73 " Place of the prophecies of the dead ;" in reference to the descrip- %0a%3c tion of the Infernal Regions in the Fourth Book of the Odyssey. %0a%3c %0a%3c 74 See Chapter 37 of this Book. « See B. iv. c. 18. %0a%3c %0a%3c 76 Supposed hy Hardouin to he the writer mentioned at the' end of B. %0a%3c yii. and B. x. : or perhaps, " a chief" of an Athenian tribe. %0a%3c %0a%3c 77 A "group of kindred." is A disciple of Carneades.

Hence it was, that when L. Paulus iEmilius, after %0a%3c the conquest of Perseus, 79 requested the Athenians to send %0a%3c him the most esteemed philosopher for the education of his %0a%3c children, and a painter to represent his triumph, they made %0a%3c choice of Metrodorus, declaring that he was eminently suited %0a%3c for either purpose ; a thing which Paulus admitted to he the %0a%3c case. %0a%3c %0a%3c Timomachus of Byzantium, in the time of the Dictator Caesar, %0a%3c painted an Ajax 80 and a Medea, which were placed by Caesar %0a%3c in the Temple of Venus Genetrix, having been purchased at %0a%3c the price of eighty talents ; the value of the Attic talent %0a%3c being, according to M. Varro, equivalent to six thousand %0a%3c denarii. An Orestes, also by Timomachus, an Iphigenia in %0a%3c Tauris, and a Lecythion, a teacher of gymnastics, are equally %0a%3c praised ; a Noble Family also ; and Two Men clothed in the %0a%3c pallium, 61 and about to enter into conversation, the one stand- %0a%3c ing, the other in a sitting posture. It is in his picture, how- %0a%3c ever of the Gorgon, 82 that the art appears to have favoured %0a%3c him most highly. %0a%3c %0a%3c Aristolaiis, the son and pupil of Pausias, was one of the %0a%3c painters in a more severe style : there are by him an Epami- %0a%3c nondas, a Pericles, a Medea, a Theseus, an emblematical %0a%3c picture of the Athenian People, and a Sacrifice of Oxen. %0a%3c Some persons, too, are pleased with the careful style of %0a%3c Nicophanes, 63 who was also a pupil of Pausias ; a carefulness, %0a%3c however, which only artists can appreciate, as in other %0a%3c respects he was harsh in his colours, and too lavish of sil ; 64 as %0a%3c in his picture, for example, of iEsculapius with his daughters, %0a%3c Hygia, 81 * iEgle, and Panacea, his Jason, and his Sluggard, %0a%3c known as the " Ocnos," 85 a man twisting a rope at one end %0a%3c as an ass gnaws it at the other.

But his most famous %0a%3c picture is his Satyr, clad in a panther's skin, and known as %0a%3c the " Aposcopeuon." 89 Aristophon 90 has painted an Ancams 91 %0a%3c wounded by the Boar, with Astypale, the sharer of his grief; %0a%3c and a picture with numerous figures, representing Priam, %0a%3c Helena, Credulity, Ulysses, Deiphobus, and Guile. 92 Andro- %0a%3c bius has painted a Scyllus 93 cutting away the anchors of the Per- %0a%3c sian fleet : and Artemon a Danae, with Bobbers in admiration ; %0a%3c a Queen Stratonice and a Hercules and Deianira.

ENCAUSTIC PAINTING. %0a%3c %0a%3c In ancient times there were but two methods of encaustic 36 %0a%3c painting, in wax and on ivory, 36 with the cestrum or pointed %0a%3c graver. When, however, this art came to be applied to the %0a%3c painting of ships of war, a third method was adopted, that of %0a%3c melting the wax colours and laying them on with a brush, %0a%3c while hot. 37 Painting of this nature, 38 applied to vessels, will %0a%3c never spoil from the action of the sun, winds, or salt water. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 42. THE COLOURING OF TISSUES. %0a%3c %0a%3c In Egypt, too, they employ a very remarkable process for the %0a%3c colouring of tissues. After pressing the material, which is white %0a%3c at first, they saturate it, not with colours, but with mordents %0a%3c that are calculated to absorb colour. This done, the tissues, %0a%3c still unchanged in appearance, are plunged into a cauldron of %0a%3c boiling dye, and are removed the next moment fully coloured. %0a%3c It is a singular fact, too, that although the dye in the pan is of %0a%3c one uniform colour, the material when taken out of it is of %0a%3c various colours, according to the nature of the mordents that %0a%3c have been respectively applied to it: these colours, too, will never %0a%3c wash out. Thus the dye-pan, which under ordinary circum- %0a%3c %0a%3c 34 Probably tbe same painter as the one mentioned in Chapter 37 of this %0a%3c Book. %0a%3c %0a%3c 35 See Chapter 39 of this Book.

Wornum is of opinion that the definition at the %0a%3c beginningof this Chapter, of two methods apparently, "mwax and on ivory," %0a%3c is in reality an explanation of owe method only, and that the ancient modes %0a%3c of painting in encaustic were not only three, but several. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 43 ] TIIE INVENTORS OF THE ART OF MODELLINO. 283 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c stances, no doubt, would have made but one colour of several, %0a%3c if coloured tissues had been put into it, is here made to yield %0a%3c several colours from a single dye.

(12.") — THE INVENTORS OF THE ART OF MODELLING. %0a%3c %0a%3c On painting we have now said enough, and more than enough ; %0a%3c but it will be only proper to append some accounts of the %0a%3c plastic art. Butades, a potter of Sicyon, was the first who in- %0a%3c vented, at Corinth, the art of modelling portraits in the earth %0a%3c which he used in his trade. It was through his daughter that %0a%3c he made the discovery; who, being deeply in love with a young- %0a%3c man about to depart on a long journey, traced the profile of %0a%3c his face, as thrown upon the wall by the light of the lamp. Upon %0a%3c seeing this, her father filled in the outline, by compressing clay %0a%3c upon the surface, and so made a face in relief, which he then %0a%3c hardened by fire along with other articles of pottery. This %0a%3c model, it is said, was preserved in the Nymphaeum 39 at Corinth, %0a%3c until the destruction of that city by Mummius. 40 Others, again, %0a%3c assert that the first inventors of the plastic art were Ehcecus 41 %0a%3c and Theodorus, 43 at Samos, a considerable period before the ex- %0a%3c pulsion of the Bacchiadae from Corinth : and that Damaratus, 43 %0a%3c on taking to flight from that place and settling in Etruria, where %0a%3c he became father of Tarquinius, who was ultimately king of %0a%3c the ltoman people, was accompanied thither by the modellers %0a%3c Euchir, 44 Diopus, and Eugrammus, by whose agency the art %0a%3c was first introduced into Italy. %0a%3c %0a%3c 39 Or Temple of the Nymplis. The daughter of Butades is called " Core" %0a%3c by Athenagoras. 40 See B. xxxiv. c. 3. %0a%3c %0a%3c 41 Son of Philaeus. He is mentioned by Pausanias, B. viii. c. 14, and %0a%3c by Herodotus, B. iii. c. 60, as the architect of a fine temple at Samos, %0a%3c and, with Smilis and Theodorus, of the Labyrinth at Lemnos. %0a%3c %0a%3c 43 Mentioned also in B. xxxiv. c. 19. Pliny is in error here in using the %0a%3c word " plastice ;" for it was the art of casting brass, and not that of making %0a%3c plaster casts, that these artists invented. %0a%3c %0a%3c 13 See Chapter 5 of this Book. He is said by Dionysius of Halicar- %0a%3c nassus, B. iii., to have been a member of the family of the Bacchiadte. %0a%3c %0a%3c il A different person, probably, from theone of the same name mentioned %0a%3c in B. vii. c. 56. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 234 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c flint's natural iiistohy. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Took XXXV. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Butades first invented the method of colouring plastic com- %0a%3c positions, by adding red earth to the material, or else modelling %0a%3c them in red chalk : he, too, was the first to make masks on the %0a%3c outer edges of gutter-tiles upon the roofs of buildings ; in %0a%3c low relief, and known as "prostypa" at first, but afterwards %0a%3c in high relief, or " ectypa." It was in these designs, 46 too, that %0a%3c the ornaments on the pediments of temples originated; %0a%3c and from this invention modellers first had their name of %0a%3c u plastaj." %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 44. — WHO WAS THE FIRST TO MOULD FIGURES IN IMITATION %0a%3c %0a%3c OF THE FEATCKKS OF LIVING PERSONS, OR OF STATCES. %0a%3c %0a%3c The first person who expressed the human features by fitting %0a%3c a mould of plaster upon the face, and then improving it by %0a%3c pouring melted wax into the cast, was Lysistratus 48 of Sicyou, %0a%3c brother of Lysippus, already mentioned. It was he, in fact, %0a%3c who first made it his 6tudy to give a faithful likeness; for %0a%3c before his time, artists only thought how to make their por- %0a%3c traits as handsome as possible. The same artist, too, was the %0a%3c first who thought of making models for his statues ; a method %0a%3c which afterwards became so universally adopted, that there %0a%3c could be neither figure nor statue made without its model in %0a%3c clay. Hence it would appear, that the art of modelling in %0a%3c clay is more ancient than that of moulding in bronze. 47 %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 45. — THE MOST FAMOUS MODELLERS. %0a%3c %0a%3c The most celebrated modellers were Damophilus and Gor- %0a%3c gasus, who were painters as well. These artists adorned with %0a%3c their works, in both kinds, the Temple of Ceres, 48 in the Circus %0a%3c Maximus at Rome ; with an inscription in Greek, which %0a%3c stated that the decorations on the right-hand were the work- %0a%3c manship of Damophilus, and those on the left, of Gorgasus. %0a%3c Varro says that, before the construction of this temple, every, %0a%3c thing was Tuscan 49 in the temples; and that, when the temple %0a%3c was afterwards repaired, the painted coatings of the walls were %0a%3c %0a%3c 45 Terra cotta figures. %0a%3c %0a%3c « See B. xxxiv. c. 19.

Chalcosthenes, 50 too, 51 ex- %0a%3c ecuted at Athens some works in unbaked earth, on the spot %0a%3c which, from his manufactory, has since obtained the name of %0a%3c " Ceramicus." 52 %0a%3c %0a%3c M. Yarro states that he knew an artist at Rome, Possis by %0a%3c name, who executed fruit, grapes, and fish, with such exact- %0a%3c ness, that it was quite impossible, by only looking at them, to %0a%3c distinguish them from the reality. He speaks very highly %0a%3c also of Arcesilaiis, 53 who was on terms of intimacy with %0a%3c Lucius Lucullus, 54 and whose models in plaster used to sell at %0a%3c a higher rate, among artists themselves, than the works of %0a%3c others. He informs us, also, that it was by this modeller that %0a%3c the Venus Genetrix in the Porum of Caosar was executed, it %0a%3c having been erected before completion, in the great haste that %0a%3c there was to consecrate it; that the same artist had made an %0a%3c agreement with Lucullus to execute a figure of Felicity, at the %0a%3c price of sixty thousand sesterces, the completion of which was %0a%3c prevented by their death; and that Octavius, a Eoman of %0a%3c equestrian rank, being desirous of a model for a mixing-bowl-, 65 %0a%3c Arcesilaiis made him one in plaster, at the price of one talent. %0a%3c %0a%3c Varro praises Pasiteles 66 also, who used to say, that the %0a%3c plastic art was the mother of chasing, statuary, and sculpture, %0a%3c and who, excellent as lie was in each of these branches, never %0a%3c executed any work without first modelling it. In addition to %0a%3c these particulars, he states that the art of modelling was %0a%3c anciently cultivated in Italy, Etruria in particular ; and that %0a%3c Volcanius was summoned from Veii, and entrusted by Tar- %0a%3c quinius Priscus with making the figure of Jupiter, which he %0a%3c intended to consecrate in the Capitol ; that this Jupiter was %0a%3c made of clay, and that hence arose the custom of painting it %0a%3c with minium ; 57 and that the four-horse chariot, so often 58 %0a%3c %0a%3c sn Sillig (Diet.

For the %0a%3c service of the table, the Samian pottery is even yet held in high %0a%3c esteem ; that, too, of Arretium in Italy, still maintains its high %0a%3c character ; while for their cups, and for those only, the ma- %0a%3c nufactories of Surrentum, Asta, Pollentia, Saguntum in Spain, %0a%3c and Pergamus in Asia, 66 are greatly esteemed. %0a%3c %0a%3c The city of Tralles, too, in Asia, and that of Mutina in Italy, %0a%3c have their respective manufactures of earthenware, and even %0a%3c by this branch of art are localities rendered famous ; their pro- %0a%3c ductions, by the aid of the potter's wheel, becoming known to %0a%3c all countries, and conveyed by sea and by land to every %0a%3c quarter of the earth. At Erythrae, there are still shown, in %0a%3c a temple there, two amphorae, that were consecrated in con- %0a%3c sequence of the singular thinness of the material : they origin- %0a%3c ated in a contest between a master and his pupil, which of the %0a%3c two could make earthenware of the greatest thinness. The %0a%3c vessels of Cos are the most highly celebrated for their beauty, %0a%3c but those of Adria 61 are considered the most substantial. %0a%3c %0a%3c In relation to these productions of art, there are some in- %0a%3c stances of severity mentioned : Q. Coponius, we find, was %0a%3c condemned for bribery, because he made present of an am- %0a%3c phora of wine to a person who had the right of voting. To %0a%3c make luxury, too, conduce in some degree to enhance our esti- %0a%3c mation of earthenware, " tripatinium,'' 68 as we learn from %0a%3c Fenestella, was the name given to the most exquisite course of %0a%3c dishes that was served up at the Horn an banquets. It con- %0a%3c sisted of one dish of mursense, 69 one of lupi, 70 and a third of a %0a%3c mixture of fish. It is clear that the public manners were %0a%3c then already on the decline ; though we still have a right to %0a%3c hold them preferable to those of the philosophers even of %0a%3c Greece, seeing that the representatives .of Aristotle, it is said, %0a%3c sold, at the auction of his goods, as many as seventy dishes of %0a%3c earthenware. It has been already 71 stated by us, when on the %0a%3c Bubject of birds, that a single dish cost the tragic actor iEsopus %0a%3c one hundred thousand sesterces ; much to the reader's indigna- %0a%3c tion, no doubt; but, by Hercules!

It was in reference to %0a%3c this circumstance, that Mucianus, in his second consulship, %0a%3c when pronouncing one of his perorations, reproached the %0a%3c memory of Vitellius with his dishes as broad as the Pomp tine %0a%3c Marsh ; not less deserving to be execrated than the poisoned %0a%3c dish of Asprenas, which, according to the accusation brought %0a%3c against him by Cassius Severus, caused the death of one %0a%3c hundred and thirty guests. 73 %0a%3c %0a%3c These works of artistic merit have conferred celebrity on %0a%3c some cities even, Rhegium for example, and Cumae. The %0a%3c priests of the Mother of the gods, known as the Galli, deprive %0a%3c themselves of their virility with a piece of Samian 74 pottery, %0a%3c the only means, if we believe M. Caelius, 75 of avoiding dangerous %0a%3c results. He it was, too, who recommended, when inveighing %0a%3c against certain abominable practices, that the person guilty of %0a%3c them should have his tongue cut out, in a similar manner ; %0a%3c a reproach which would appear to have been levelled by anti- %0a%3c cipation against this same Vitellius. %0a%3c %0a%3c What is there that human industry will not devise ? Even %0a%3c broken pottery has been utilized ; it being found that, beaten %0a%3c to powder, and tempered with lime, it becomes more solid and %0a%3c durable than other substances of a similar nature ; forming the %0a%3c cement known as the " Signine " 76 composition, so extensively %0a%3c employed for even making the pavements of houses. 77 %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAT. 47.

WALLS OF BRICK. THE METHOD OF MAKING BRICKS. %0a%3c %0a%3c Earth for making bricks should never be extracted from a %0a%3c sandy or gravelly soil, and still less from one that is stony ; %0a%3c but from a stratum that is white and cretaceous, or else im- %0a%3c pregnated with red earth. 81 If a sandy soil must be employed %0a%3c for the purpose, it should at least be male 88 sand, and no other. %0a%3c The spring is the best season for making bricks, as at midsum- %0a%3c mer they are very apt to crack. For building, bricks two %0a%3c years old are the only ones that are approved of; and the %0a%3c wrought material of them should be well macerated before %0a%3c they are made. %0a%3c %0a%3c There are three different kinds of bricks ; the Lydian, which %0a%3c is in use with us, a foot-and-a-half in length by a foot in %0a%3c breadth ; the tetradoron ; and the pentadoron ; the word "doron" %0a%3c being used by the ancient Greeks to signify the palm 88 — hence, %0a%3c too, their word " doron" meaning a gift, because it is the %0a%3c hand that gives. — These last two kinds, therefore, are named %0a%3c respectively from their being four and five palms in length, %0a%3c the breadth being the same. The smaller kind is used in %0a%3c Greece for private buildings, the larger for the construction of %0a%3c public edifices. At Pitane, 87 in Asia, and in the cities of Max- %0a%3c ilua and Calentum in Farther Spain, there are bricks 88 made, %0a%3c which float in water, when dry ; the material being a sort of %0a%3c %0a%3c 83 See B. ii. c. 73 . 84 "Rubrica." 85 g ee B> c 2 8. %0a%3c %0a%3c 86 "Which was, as a measure, nearly three inches in breadth.

The Greeks have always preferred walls of %0a%3c brick, except in those cases where they could find silicious %0a%3c stone for the purposes of building : for walls of this nature %0a%3c will last for ever, if they are only built on the perpendicular. %0a%3c Hence it is, that the Greeks have built their public edifices and %0a%3c the palaces of their kings of brick ; the wall at Athens, for %0a%3c example, which faces Mount Hymettus ; the Temples of %0a%3c Jupiter and Hercules at Patrae, 89 although the columns and %0a%3c architraves in the interior are of stone ; the palace of King %0a%3c Attalus atTralles; the palace of Croesus at Sardes, now con- %0a%3c verted into an asylum 90 for aged persons ; and that of King %0a%3c Mausolus at Halicarnassus ; edifices, all of them, still in ex- %0a%3c istence. %0a%3c %0a%3c Muraenaand Varro, in their aedileship, had a fine fresco paint- %0a%3c ing, on the plaster of a wall at Lacedsemon, cut away from %0a%3c the bricks, and transported in wooden frames to Rome, for the %0a%3c purpose of adorning the Comitium. Admirable as the work %0a%3c was of itself, it was still more admired after being thus trans- %0a%3c ferred. In Italy also there are walls of brick, at Arretiuni %0a%3c and Mevania. 91 At Rome, there are no buildings of this de- %0a%3c scription, because a wall only a foot-and-a-half in thickness %0a%3c would not support more than a single story; and by public %0a%3c ordinance it has been enacted that no partition should exceed %0a%3c that thickness ; nor, indeed, does the peculiar construction of %0a%3c our party- walls admit of it. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 50.

SULPHUR, AND THE SEVERAL VARIETIES OF IT : %0a%3c %0a%3c FOURTEEN REMEDIES. %0a%3c %0a%3c Let thus much be deemed sufficient on the subject of bricks. %0a%3c Among the other kinds of earth, the one of the most singular %0a%3c nature, perhaps, is sulphur, an agent of great power upon other %0a%3c substances. Sulphur is found in the iEolian Islands, between %0a%3c Sicily and Italy, which are volcanic, as already 92 stated. But %0a%3c the finest sulphur of all, is that which comes from the Isle of %0a%3c Melos. It is obtained also in Italy, upon the range of hills in %0a%3c the territories of Neapolis and Campania, known as the Leuco- %0a%3c gsei : 93 when extracted from the mines there, it is purified by %0a%3c the agency of fire. %0a%3c %0a%3c 89 See B. iv. c. 5, and B. xxxvi. c. 4. %0a%3c %0a%3c »" " Gerusia." 91 See li. iii. c. 19. 92 In B. iii. c. 6. %0a%3c %0a%3c 93 See B. xviii. c. 29. %0a%3c %0a%3c U 2 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 2!) 2 pliny's natural history. [Book XXXV. %0a%3c %0a%3c There are four kinds of sulphur ; the first of which is " live" %0a%3c sulphur, known as " apyron" 91 by the Greeks, and found in solid %0a%3c masses, or in other words, in blocks. This, too, is the only sulphur %0a%3c that is extracted in its native state, the others being found in a %0a%3c state of liquescence, and requiring to be purified by being boiled %0a%3c in oil. This kind is green and transparent, and is the only %0a%3c sulphur that is used for medicinal purposes. A second kind is %0a%3c known as the " glebaceous" 95 sulphur, and is solely employed in %0a%3c the workshops of the fullers. The third kind, also, is only used %0a%3c for a single purpose, that of fumigating wool, a process which %0a%3c contributes very greatly to making the wool white and soft ; %0a%3c " egula" 95 is the name given to it. The fourth kind is used %0a%3c in the preparation of matches more particularly. %0a%3c %0a%3c In addition to these several uses, sulphur is of such remark- %0a%3c able virtue, that if it is thrown upon the fire it will at once %0a%3c detect, by the smell, whether or not a person is subject to %0a%3c epilepsy. Anaxilaiis used to employ this substance by way %0a%3c of pastime : putting sulphur in a cup of wine, with some %0a%3c hot coals beneath, he would hand it round to the guests, the %0a%3c light given by it, while burning, throwing a ghastly paleness %0a%3c like that of death upon the face of each. Its properties are ca- %0a%3c lorific and maturative, in addition to which, it disperses abscesses %0a%3c on the body : hence it is that it is used as an ingredient in %0a%3c plasters and emollient poultices. Applied to the loins and %0a%3c kidneys, with grease, when there are pains in those parts, it %0a%3c is marvellously effectual as a remedy. In combination with %0a%3c turpentine, it removes lichens on the face, and leprosy, 96 the %0a%3c preparation being known as " harpax," 97 from the celerity %0a%3c with which it acts upon the skin ; for which reason it ought to %0a%3c be removed every now and then. Employed as an electuary, it is %0a%3c good for asthma, purulent expectorations, and stings inflicted %0a%3c by scorpions. Live sulphur, mixed with nitre, and then bruised %0a%3c with vinegar and applied, causes morphew to disappear, and %0a%3c destroys nits in the hair ; in combination, too, with sandarach %0a%3c and vinegar, it is good for diseases of the eyelids. %0a%3c %0a%3c Sulphur has its place among our religious ceremonies, being %0a%3c used as a fumigation for purifying houses. 98 Its virtues are %0a%3c %0a%3c 94 "Untouched by fire."

BITUMEN, AND THE SEVERAL VARIETIES OF IT; %0a%3c %0a%3c TWENTY-SEVEN REMEDIES. %0a%3c %0a%3c Nearly approaching to the nature of sulphur is that of bitu- %0a%3c men, 1 which in some places assumes the form of a slime, and %0a%3c in others that of an earth ; a slime, thrown up, as already 2 %0a%3c stated, by a certain lake in Judaea, and an earth, found in the %0a%3c vicinity of Sidon, a maritime town of Syria. In both these %0a%3c states, it admits of being thickened and condensed. There %0a%3c is also a liquid 3 bitumen, that of Zacynthus, for example, and %0a%3c the bitumen that is imported from Babylon ; which last kind %0a%3c is also white : the bitumen, too, of Apollonia is liquid. All %0a%3c these kinds, in Greek, have the one general name of "pissas- %0a%3c phaltos," 4 from their strong resemblance to a compound of %0a%3c pitch and bitumen. There is also found an unctuous liquid %0a%3c bitumen, resembling oil, in a spring at Agrigentum, in Sicily, %0a%3c the waters of which are tainted by it. The inhabitants of the %0a%3c spot collect it on the panicles of reeds, to which it very readily %0a%3c adheres, and make use of it for burning in lamps, as a sub- %0a%3c stitute for oil, as also for the cure of itch- scab in beasts of %0a%3c burden. %0a%3c %0a%3c Some authorities include among the bitumens, naphtha, a sub- %0a%3c stance which we have already mentioned in the Second Book; 5 %0a%3c but the burning properties which it possesses, and its sus- %0a%3c ceptibility of igniting, render it quite unfit for use. Bitumen, %0a%3c to be of good quality, should be extremely brilliant, heavy, %0a%3c and massive ; it should also be moderately smooth, it being %0a%3c very much the practice to adulterate it with pitch.

Asphalt, or bitumen of Judaea, solid, in- %0a%3c soluble in alcohol, and found in Lake Asphaltites in Syria, more particu- %0a%3c larly. 3.

It is administered in a similar manner for %0a%3c dysentery, and is very good for arresting looseness of the %0a%3c bowels. Taken internally with vinegar, it dissolves and brings %0a%3c away coagulated blood. It modifies pains also in the loins %0a%3c and joints, and, applied with barlej'-meal, it forms a peculiar %0a%3c kind of plaster, to which it has given its name. 7 It stanches %0a%3c blood also, heals wounds, and unites the sinews when severed. %0a%3c Bitumen is administered for quartan fevers, in doses of one %0a%3c drachma to an equal quantity of hedyosmos, 8 the whole kneaded %0a%3c up with one obolus of myrrh.

Employed as a fumigation, it acts as a check upon %0a%3c procidence of the uterus, and, taken internally with wine, it %0a%3c has the effect of an emmenagogue. %0a%3c %0a%3c Another use that is made of it, is for coating the inside %0a%3c of copper vessels, it rendering them proof against the action %0a%3c of fire. It has been already 10 stated that bitumen was formerly %0a%3c employed for staining copper and coating statues. It has been %0a%3c used, too, as a substitute for lime ; the walls of Babylon, for %0a%3c instance, which are cemented with it.

Of this, too, %0a%3c there are several kinds. In Cyprus there is a white alumen, %0a%3c and another kind of a darker colour. The difference, however, %0a%3c in their colour is but trifling in reality, though the uses made %0a%3c of them are very dissimilar ; the white liquid alumen being %0a%3c employed for dyeing 13 wool of bright colours, and the black, %0a%3c on the other hand, for giving wool a tawny or a sombre tint. %0a%3c Gold, too, is purified 11 by the agency of black alumen. Every %0a%3c kind of alumen is a compound of slime and water, or in other %0a%3c words, is a liquid product exuding from the earth; the concre- %0a%3c tion of it commencing in winter, and being completed by the %0a%3c action of the summer sun. That portion of it which is the %0a%3c first matured, is the whitest in appearance. %0a%3c %0a%3c The countries which produce this substance, are Spain, %0a%3c uiEgypt, Armenia, Macedonia, Pontus, Africa, 18 and the islands %0a%3c of Sardinia, Melos, Lipara, and Strongyle : 16 the most es- %0a%3c teemed, however, is that of Egypt, 17 the next best being the %0a%3c produce of Melos. Of this last kind there are also two %0a%3c varieties, the liquid alumen, and the solid. Liquid alumen, %0a%3c to be good, should be of a limpid, milky, appearance : when %0a%3c rubbed between the fingers it should be free from grit, and %0a%3c productive of a slight sensation of heat. The name given to it %0a%3c is " phorimon." 18 The mode of detecting whether or not it has %0a%3c been adulterated, is by the application of pomegranate-juice ; %0a%3c for if genuine, it will turn black on combining with the %0a%3c juice. The other, or solid alumen, is pale and rough in ap- %0a%3c %0a%3c 11 Beckmann is of opinion that our alum was not known to the Greeks %0a%3c or Romans, and that what the latter called " alumen" was green vitriol, %0a%3c or sulphate of the protoxide of iron, in an impure state. Hist. Inv. Vol. J. %0a%3c p. 180. Bohn's Edition. Dr. Pereira remarks, however, that "there %0a%3c can be little doubt that Pliny was acquainted with our alum, but did not %0a%3c distinguish it from sulphate of iron, for he informs us that one kind of %0a%3c alum was white, and was used for dyeing wool of bright colours."

The remedy, %0a%3c when thus used, is employed in the bath, the proportions %0a%3c being two parts of honey to one of alumen. It has the effect, %0a%3c also, of checking and dispersing perspiration, and of neu- %0a%3c tralizing offensive odours of the arm-pits. It is taken too, in %0a%3c the form of pills, for affections of the spleen, and for the pur- %0a%3c pose of carrying off blood by the urine : incorporated with nitre %0a%3c and melanthium, 20 it is curative of itch-scab. %0a%3c %0a%3c There is one kind of solid alumen, known to the Greeks as %0a%3c " schiston," 21 which splits into filaments of a whitish colour; %0a%3c for which reason some have preferred giving it the name of %0a%3c " trichitis." 22 It is produced from the mineral ore known to %0a%3c us as " chalcitis," 23 from which copper is also produced, it %0a%3c being a sort of exudation from that mineral, coagulated into %0a%3c the form of scum. This kind of alumen is less desiccative %0a%3c than the others, and is not so useful as a check upon bad %0a%3c humours of the body. Used, however, either in the form of a %0a%3c liniment or of an injection, it is highly beneficial to the ears ; %0a%3c as also for ulcerations of the mouth, and for tooth-ache, if %0a%3c retained with the saliva in the mouth. It is employed also %0a%3c as a serviceable ingredient in compositions for the eyes, and %0a%3c for the generative organs in either sex. The mode of pre- %0a%3c paring it is to roast it in crucibles, until it has quite lost its %0a%3c liquid form. %0a%3c %0a%3c There is another variety of alumen also, of a less active na- %0a%3c ture, and known as " strongyle ;" 2i which is again subdivided %0a%3c into two kinds ; the fungous, which easily dissolves in any %0a%3c liquid, and is looked upon as altogether worthless ; and the %0a%3c porous, which is full of small holes like a sponge, and in %0a%3c pieces of a globular form, more nearly approaching white %0a%3c alumen in appearance.

This last kind is calcined by itself upon hot coals, %0a%3c unmixed with any other substance, until it is entirely reduced %0a%3c to ashes. %0a%3c %0a%3c The best kind of all, however, is that called " melinum," 25 %0a%3c as coming from the Isle of Melos, as already mentioned ; none %0a%3c being more effectual for acting as an astringent, staining %0a%3c black, and indurating, and none assuming a closer consistency. %0a%3c It removes granulations of the eye-lids, and, in a calcined state, %0a%3c is still more efficacious for checking defluxions of the eyes : %0a%3c in this last form, too, it is employed for the cure of prurigi- %0a%3c nous eruptions on the body. Whether taken internally, or %0a%3c employed externally, it arrests discharges of blood ; and if it is %0a%3c applied with vinegar to a part from which the hair has been %0a%3c first removed, it will change into a soft down the hair which %0a%3c replaces it. The leading property of every kind of alumen is %0a%3c its remarkable astringency, to which, in fact, it is indebted for %0a%3c its name 26 with the Greeks. It is for this property that the %0a%3c various kinds are, all of them, so remarkably good for the %0a%3c eyes. In combination with grease, they arrest discharges of %0a%3c blood ; and they are employed in a similar manner for check- %0a%3c ing the spread of putrid ulcers, and for removing sores upon %0a%3c the bodies of infants. %0a%3c %0a%3c Alumen has a desiccative effect upon dropsical eruptions ; %0a%3c and, in combination with pomegranate juice, it removes dis- %0a%3c eases of the ears, malformed nails, indurations resulting from %0a%3c cicatrization, hangnails, and chilblains. Calcined, with vine- %0a%3c gar or nut-galls, in equal proportions, it is curative of phage- %0a%3c daenic ulcers; and, in combination with extracted juice of %0a%3c cabbage, of leprosy. Used in the proportion of one part of %0a%3c alumen to two of salt, it arrests the progress of serpiginous %0a%3c eruptions ; and an infusion of it in water destroys lice and %0a%3c other parasitical insects that infest the hair. Employed in a %0a%3c similar manner, it is good for burns ; and, in combination with %0a%3c the serous 27 part of pitch, for furfuraceous eruptions on the %0a%3c body. It is used also as an injection for dysentery, and, em- %0a%3c ployed in the form of a gargle, it braces the uvula and tonsil- %0a%3c lary glands.

They are both prepared for use %0a%3c by being calcined and then rinsed in water, some persons %0a%3c giving the preference to the first. They are both of them %0a%3c useful for discharges of blood from the mouth, and are em- %0a%3c ployed as an ingredient in plasters of a desiccative nature. %0a%3c They are used also in the preparation of ophthalmic compo- %0a%3c sitions. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 54. THE VARIOUS KINDS OF ERETRIA. %0a%3c %0a%3c Of eretria, or Eretrian 32 earth, there are also the same number %0a%3c of varieties ; one white, and the other of an ashy colour, this %0a%3c last being preferred in medicine. To be good, this earth %0a%3c should be of a soft consistency, and when rubbed upon copper %0a%3c it should leave a violet tint.

It is used more particularly as a cosmetic for %0a%3c the skin of females; the Selinusian 34 earth being also employed %0a%3c for a similar purpose. This last is of a milk-white colour, %0a%3c and melts very rapidly in water : dissolved in milk, it is em- %0a%3c ployed for whitening the plaster coats on walls. Pnigitis 35 is %0a%3c very similar to Eretrian earth, only that it is found in larger %0a%3c masses, and is of a glutinous consistency. Its effects are %0a%3c similar to those produced by Cimolian 36 earth, but are not so %0a%3c energetic. %0a%3c %0a%3c Ainpelitis 37 is an earth which bears a strong resemblance to %0a%3c bitumen. The test of its goodness is its dissolving in oil, like %0a%3c wax, and preserving its black colour when submitted to the %0a%3c action of fire. Its properties are emollient and repercussive ; %0a%3c for which reason, it is used in medicinal compositions, those %0a%3c known as " calliblephara," 38 more particularly, and in prepara- %0a%3c tions for dyeing the hair. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 57.

They are curative %0a%3c also of inflammatory swellings and imposthumes of the parotid %0a%3c glands; and, applied topically, they are good for affections of %0a%3c the spleen and pustules on the body. With the addition of %0a%3c aphronitrum, 41 oil of cypros, 42 and vinegar, they reduce %0a%3c swellings of the feet, care being taken to apply the lotion in %0a%3c the sun, and at the end of six hours to wash it off with salt %0a%3c and water. In combination with wax and oil of cypros, %0a%3c Cimolian earth is good for swellings of the testes. %0a%3c %0a%3c Cretaceous earths, too, are of a cooling tendency, and, %0a%3c applied to the body in the form of a liniment, they act as a %0a%3c check upon excessive perspiration : taken with wine, in the %0a%3c bath, they remove pimples on the body. The most esteemed %0a%3c of all these earths is that of Thessaly : it is found also in the %0a%3c vicinity of Bubon 43 in Lycia. %0a%3c %0a%3c Cimolian earth is used also for another purpose, that of %0a%3c scouring cloth. As to the kind which is brought from Sar- %0a%3c dinia, and is known as "sarda," it is used for white tissues %0a%3c only, and is never employed for coloured cloths. Indeed, this %0a%3c last is held in the lowest estimation of all the Cimolian earths; %0a%3c whereas, that of Umbria is more highly esteemed, as also the %0a%3c kind generally known as " saxum." 44 It is a property of %0a%3c this last to increase in weight 45 by maceration, and it is by %0a%3c weight that it is usually sold, Sardinian earth being sold by- %0a%3c measure.

Antonius ; as also, Menas 62 and Menecrates, 63 %0a%3c freedmen of Sextus Pompeius, and many others as well, whom %0a%3c it would be superfluous to enumerate, and who have enriched %0a%3c themselves at the cost of Boinan blood, and the licence that %0a%3c results from proscription. %0a%3c %0a%3c Such is the mark that is set upon those droves of slaves %0a%3c which we see on sale, such the opprobrium thrown upon them %0a%3c by a capricious fortune ! And yet, some of these very men have %0a%3c we beheld in the enjoyment of such power and influence, that %0a%3c the senate itself has decreed them — at the command of Agrip- %0a%3c pina, 64 wife of the Emperor Claudius — the decorations even of %0a%3c the praetorship : all but honoured with the fasces and their %0a%3c laurels, in fact, and sent back in state to the very place from %0a%3c which they originally came, with their feet whitened with the %0a%3c slave- dealer's chalk ! %0a%3c %0a%3c 67 Supposed by some to have been the Manilius who was author of the %0a%3c poem called " Astronomica," still in existence. It is more probable, how- %0a%3c ever, that he was the father of the poet, or perhaps the grandfather ; as it %0a%3c is clear from a passage in Suetonius, that Staberius Eros taught at Borne %0a%3c during the civil wars of Sylla, while the poem must have been written, in %0a%3c part at least, after the death of Augustus. %0a%3c %0a%3c 58 Being afterwards manumitted. Sillig thinks that they may have %0a%3c arrived in Borne about b.c. 90. %0a%3c %0a%3c 59 " Catasta." A raised platform of wood on which the slaves were %0a%3c exposed for sale. %0a%3c %0a%3c 60 " Bectorem." For an explanation of this allusion, see B. xxviii. c. 14. %0a%3c %0a%3c 61 A native of Gadara in Syria, according to Josephus. Seneca speaks of %0a%3c him as being more wealthy than his master. %0a%3c %0a%3c « Or Menodorus, who deserted Sextus Pompeius and went over to %0a%3c Octavianus. %0a%3c %0a%3c 63 Who remained faithful to Pompeius, and died in his cause %0a%3c «* He is probably speaking in reference to her paramour, the freedman %0a%3c Pallas, bee B. xxxm. c. 4/. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Cbap. 59.J %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 6UMMAET. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 303 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 59. (19.) THE EARTH OF GALATA; OF CLTPEA ; OF THE %0a%3c %0a%3c BALEARE8 ; AND OF EBUSUS. %0a%3c %0a%3c In addition to these, there are various other kinds of earth, %0a%3c endowed with peculiar properties of their own, and which have %0a%3c heen already mentioned on former occasions. 65 We may, %0a%3c however, take the present opportunity of again remarking the %0a%3c following properties. The earth of the island of Galata and of %0a%3c the vicinity of Clypea, in Africa, is fatal to scorpions; and that %0a%3c of the Balearic Islands and of Ebusus kills serpents. %0a%3c %0a%3c Summary. — Remedies, narratives, and observations, nine %0a%3c hundred and fifty-six. %0a%3c %0a%3c Roman Authors quoted. — Messala 1 the Orator, the Elder %0a%3c Messala, 2 Fenestella, 3 Atticus, 4 M.
