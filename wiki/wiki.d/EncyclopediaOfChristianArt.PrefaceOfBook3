For  he  had  read  in  Exodus  that  God %0ahad  given  a  command  to  Moses  for  the  construction  of %0athe  tabernacle,  and  had  selected  by  name  the  masters %0aof  the  works,  and  that  he  had  filled  them  with  the %0aspirit  of  wisdom  and  intelligence  and  science,  in  every %0aknowledge,  for  inventing  and  executing  work  in  gold %0aand  silver,  and  brass,  gems,  wood,  and  in  art  of  all %0akinds ;  and  he  had  discerned,  by  means  of  pious  reflec- %0ation, that  God  complacently  beheld  decoration  of  this %0akind,  which  He  was  appointing  to  be  constructed  under %0athe  teaching  and  authority  of  his  Holy  Spirit ;  and  he %0abelieved  that  without  His  inspiration  no  one  could %0amould  any  work  of  this  kind.  Therefore,  most  be- %0aloved son,  you  will  not  doubt,  but  believe  with  an %0aentire  faith,  that  the  Spirit  of  God  has  filled  your  heart %0awhen  you  have  adorned  his  temple  with  so  much  beauty, %0aand  with  such  variety  of  work  ;  and  that  you  may  not %0achance  to  fear,  I  can  prove,  with  clear  reasoning,  that %0awhatsoever  you  may  be  able  to  learn,  understand,  or %0ainvent  in  the  arts,  is  ministered  to  you  as  a  gift  of  the %0asevenfold  Spirit. %0a%0aThrough  the  spirit  of  wisdom  you  know  that  all %0acreated  things  proceed  from  God,  and  that  without  him %0anothing  exists.  Through  the  spirit  of  intelligence  you %0ahave  acquired  the  faculty  of  genius,  in  whatever  order, %0ain  what  variety,  in  what  proportion,  you  may  choose  to %0aapply  to  your  varied  work.  Through  the  spirit  of  counsel %0ayou  do  not  hide  the  talent  conceded  to  you  by  God,  but  by %0a%0a%0a204  PROLOGUS    IN    LIBRUM    TERTIUM. %0a%0aabficondis,  sed  cum  humilitate  palam  operando  et  do- %0acendo,  cognoscere  cupientibus  fideliter  ostendis;  per %0aspiritum  fortitudinis  omnem  segnitiei  torporem  excutis, %0aet  quicquid  non  lento  conamine  incipis,  plenis  viribus %0aad  efFectum  perducis ;  per  spiritum  scientiae  concessum, %0aex  abundanti  corde  dominaris  ingenio,  et  quo  perfect^ %0aabundas  plense  mentis  audacia  uteris  in  publico;  per %0aspiritum  pietatis,  quid,  cui,  quando,  quantum  vel  qua- %0aliter  opens,  et  ne  subrepat  avaritise  seu  cupiditatis  vi- %0atium,  mercedis  pretium  pia  consideratione  moderaris; %0aper  spiritum  timoris  Domini  te  nihil  ex  te  posse  con- %0asideras,  nihil  incoucessum  a  Deo  te  habere  seu  velle %0acogitas,  sed  credendo,  confitendo,  gratias  agendo,  quic- %0aquid nosti,  Tel  es,  aut  esse  potes,  divinse  misericordiae %0arcputas. %0a%0a%0aHis  virtutum  stipulationibus  animatus,  carissime %0aFili,  domum  Dei,  fiducialiter  aggressus,  tanto  lepore %0adecorasti,  et  laquearia  seu  parietes  diverse  opere, %0adiversisque  coloribus  distinguens  paradysi  Dei  speciem %0afloribus  Tariis  vemantem,  gramine  foliisque  virentem,  et %0asanctorum  animas  diversi  meriti  coronis  foventem,  quo- %0adammodo  aspicientibus  ostendisti,  quodque  creatorem %0aDeum  in  creatura  laudant,  et  mirabilem  in  suis  operi- %0a*v^bus  prsedicant,  efFecisti.

Through  the  spirit  of  the  fear  of %0aGod  you  meditate  that  you  can  do  nothing  from  your- %0aself, but  you  consider  that  you  possess,  or  will,  nothing %0aunconceded  by  God;  but  by  believing,  confiding  and %0agiving  thanks,  you  ascribe  to  divine  compassion  what- %0aever you  have  learned,  or  what  you  are,  or  what  you %0amay  be. %0a%0aAnimated,  dearest  son,  by  these  covenants  with  the %0avirtues,  thou  hast  confidently  approached  the  house  of %0aGod,  hast  decorated  with  the  utmost  beauty  ceilings  or %0awalls  with  various  work,  and,  showing  forth  with  differ- %0aent colours  a  likeness  of  the  paradise  of  God,  glowing %0awith  various  flowers,  and  verdant  with  herbs  and  leaves, %0aand  cherishing  the  lives  of  the  saints  with  crowns  of %0avarious  merit,  thou  hast,  after  a  fashion,  shown  to  be- %0aholders everything  in  creation  praising  God,  its  Creator, %0aand  hast  caused  them  to  proclaim  him  admirable  in  all %0ahis  works.

But  if  perchance  a %0afaithful  mind  should  behold  a  representation  of  our %0aLord's  passion  expressed  in  drawing,  it  is  penetrated %0awith  compunction ;  if  it  beholds  how  many  sufferings %0athe  saints  have  bodily  supported,  and  how  many  re- %0awards of  eternal  life  they  have  received,  it  quickly %0ainduces  the  observance  of  a  better  life ;  if  it  regards %0ahow  much  rejoicing  is  in  heaven,  and  how  much  suffer- %0aing in  the  flames  of  hell,  it  is  animated  by  hope  for  its %0agood  actions,  and  is  struck  with  fear  by  the  considera- %0ation of  its  sins. %0a%0aAct  therefore  now,  well-intentioned  man,  happy  be- %0afore God  and  men  in  this  life,  happier  in  a  future,  in %0awhose  labour  and  study  so  many  sacrifices  are  offered %0aup  to  God  ;  henceforth  warm  thyself  with  a  more  ample %0ainvention,  hasten  to  complete  with  all  the  study  of  thy %0amind  those  things  which  are  still  wanting  among  the %0autensils  of  the  house  of  the  Lord,  without  which  the %0adivine  mysteries  and  the  services  of  ceremonies  cannot %0acontinue.

Therefore,  most  be- %0a%3c loved son,  you  will  not  doubt,  but  believe  with  an %0a%3c entire  faith,  that  the  Spirit  of  God  has  filled  your  heart %0a%3c when  you  have  adorned  his  temple  with  so  much  beauty, %0a%3c and  with  such  variety  of  work  ;  and  that  you  may  not %0a%3c chance  to  fear,  I  can  prove,  with  clear  reasoning,  that %0a%3c whatsoever  you  may  be  able  to  learn,  understand,  or %0a%3c invent  in  the  arts,  is  ministered  to  you  as  a  gift  of  the %0a%3c sevenfold  Spirit. %0a%3c %0a%3c Through  the  spirit  of  wisdom  you  know  that  all %0a%3c created  things  proceed  from  God,  and  that  without  him %0a%3c nothing  exists.  Through  the  spirit  of  intelligence  you %0a%3c have  acquired  the  faculty  of  genius,  in  whatever  order, %0a%3c in  what  variety,  in  what  proportion,  you  may  choose  to %0a%3c apply  to  your  varied  work.  Through  the  spirit  of  counsel %0a%3c you  do  not  hide  the  talent  conceded  to  you  by  God,  but  by %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 204  PROLOGUS    IN    LIBRUM    TERTIUM. %0a%3c %0a%3c abficondis,  sed  cum  humilitate  palam  operando  et  do- %0a%3c cendo,  cognoscere  cupientibus  fideliter  ostendis;  per %0a%3c spiritum  fortitudinis  omnem  segnitiei  torporem  excutis, %0a%3c et  quicquid  non  lento  conamine  incipis,  plenis  viribus %0a%3c ad  efFectum  perducis ;  per  spiritum  scientiae  concessum, %0a%3c ex  abundanti  corde  dominaris  ingenio,  et  quo  perfect^ %0a%3c abundas  plense  mentis  audacia  uteris  in  publico;  per %0a%3c spiritum  pietatis,  quid,  cui,  quando,  quantum  vel  qua- %0a%3c liter  opens,  et  ne  subrepat  avaritise  seu  cupiditatis  vi- %0a%3c tium,  mercedis  pretium  pia  consideratione  moderaris; %0a%3c per  spiritum  timoris  Domini  te  nihil  ex  te  posse  con- %0a%3c sideras,  nihil  incoucessum  a  Deo  te  habere  seu  velle %0a%3c cogitas,  sed  credendo,  confitendo,  gratias  agendo,  quic- %0a%3c quid nosti,  Tel  es,  aut  esse  potes,  divinse  misericordiae %0a%3c rcputas. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c His  virtutum  stipulationibus  animatus,  carissime %0a%3c Fili,  domum  Dei,  fiducialiter  aggressus,  tanto  lepore %0a%3c decorasti,  et  laquearia  seu  parietes  diverse  opere, %0a%3c diversisque  coloribus  distinguens  paradysi  Dei  speciem %0a%3c floribus  Tariis  vemantem,  gramine  foliisque  virentem,  et %0a%3c sanctorum  animas  diversi  meriti  coronis  foventem,  quo- %0a%3c dammodo  aspicientibus  ostendisti,  quodque  creatorem %0a%3c Deum  in  creatura  laudant,  et  mirabilem  in  suis  operi- %0a%3c *v^bus  prsedicant,  efFecisti.

Through  the %0a%3c spirit  of  perseverance  you  shake  off  all  lethargy  of  sloth, %0a%3c and  whatever  with  quick  diligence  you  commence,  you %0a%3c carry  through  with  full  vigour  to  the  completion. %0a%3c Through  the  spirit  of  science  accorded  to  you,  you  rule %0a%3c with  genius  from  an  abounding  heart,  and  from  that %0a%3c with  which  you  entirely  overflow  you  bestow  with  the %0a%3c confidence  of  a  well-stored  mind  for  the  common  good. %0a%3c Through  the  spirit  of  piety  you  regulate  the  nature,  the %0a%3c destination,  the  time^  the  measure  and  the  means  of %0a%3c the  work;  and,  through  a  pious  consideration,  the  price %0a%3c of  the  fee,  that  the  vice  of  avarice  or  covetousness %0a%3c may  not  steal  in.  Through  the  spirit  of  the  fear  of %0a%3c God  you  meditate  that  you  can  do  nothing  from  your- %0a%3c self, but  you  consider  that  you  possess,  or  will,  nothing %0a%3c unconceded  by  God;  but  by  believing,  confiding  and %0a%3c giving  thanks,  you  ascribe  to  divine  compassion  what- %0a%3c ever you  have  learned,  or  what  you  are,  or  what  you %0a%3c may  be. %0a%3c %0a%3c Animated,  dearest  son,  by  these  covenants  with  the %0a%3c virtues,  thou  hast  confidently  approached  the  house  of %0a%3c God,  hast  decorated  with  the  utmost  beauty  ceilings  or %0a%3c walls  with  various  work,  and,  showing  forth  with  differ- %0a%3c ent colours  a  likeness  of  the  paradise  of  God,  glowing %0a%3c with  various  flowers,  and  verdant  with  herbs  and  leaves, %0a%3c and  cherishing  the  lives  of  the  saints  with  crowns  of %0a%3c various  merit,  thou  hast,  after  a  fashion,  shown  to  be- %0a%3c holders everything  in  creation  praising  God,  its  Creator, %0a%3c and  hast  caused  them  to  proclaim  him  admirable  in  all %0a%3c his  works.  Nor  is  the  eye  of  man  even  able  to  decide %0a%3c upon  which  work  it  may  first  fix  its  glance ;  if  it  be- %0a%3c holds the  ceilings,  they  glow  like  draperies ;  if  it  re- %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 206  PROLOGl'S    IN    LIBRUM    TKRTIUM. %0a%3c %0a%3c rietes,  est  paradysi  species ;  si  lumiDis  abundantiam  ex %0a%3c fenestris  intuetur,  inestimabilem  vitri  decorem  et  opens %0a%3c pretiosissimi  varietatem  miratur.

But  if  perchance  a %0a%3c faithful  mind  should  behold  a  representation  of  our %0a%3c Lord's  passion  expressed  in  drawing,  it  is  penetrated %0a%3c with  compunction ;  if  it  beholds  how  many  sufferings %0a%3c the  saints  have  bodily  supported,  and  how  many  re- %0a%3c wards of  eternal  life  they  have  received,  it  quickly %0a%3c induces  the  observance  of  a  better  life ;  if  it  regards %0a%3c how  much  rejoicing  is  in  heaven,  and  how  much  suffer- %0a%3c ing in  the  flames  of  hell,  it  is  animated  by  hope  for  its %0a%3c good  actions,  and  is  struck  with  fear  by  the  considera- %0a%3c tion of  its  sins. %0a%3c %0a%3c Act  therefore  now,  well-intentioned  man,  happy  be- %0a%3c fore God  and  men  in  this  life,  happier  in  a  future,  in %0a%3c whose  labour  and  study  so  many  sacrifices  are  offered %0a%3c up  to  God  ;  henceforth  warm  thyself  with  a  more  ample %0a%3c invention,  hasten  to  complete  with  all  the  study  of  thy %0a%3c mind  those  things  which  are  still  wanting  among  the %0a%3c utensils  of  the  house  of  the  Lord,  without  which  the %0a%3c divine  mysteries  and  the  services  of  ceremonies  cannot %0a%3c continue.  These  are  the  chalices,  candelabra,  incense %0a%3c burners,  vials,  pitchers,  caskets  of  sacred  relics,  crosses, %0a%3c missals  and  other  things  which  usefiil  necessity  requires %0a%3c for  the  use  of  the  ecclesiastical  order. %0a%3c %0a%3c If  you  wish  to  fabricate  these,  in  this  order  you %0a%3c commence. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c END    OF   THE    PREFACE. %0a\ No newline at end of file%0a
