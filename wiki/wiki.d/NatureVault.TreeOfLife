Formulated at 10%25 essential oils so it can be used in sensitive areas, it is designed as a "do everything and go anywhere" oil.  Use it for anything from massage; to improving itchiness, squirming sensations, or inflammation; odors, wounds, or injuries; improving the skin; improving health; anointing for spiritual reasons and helping with and preventing sickness; anointing the head for opening the third eye; etc.%0a%0aRelease oil was actually designed to mimic the anointing oil in the bible exodus 30:22 which in turn mimicked Egyptian spiritual oils.  In addition to using the same ingredients as the biblical anointing oil in roughly the same amounts, many other essential oils were added as well to serve even more uses.  Instead of just olive oil as a base, a blend of many useful oils are used to balance the fatty acids.  In the bible this recipe was used to anoint all over the head and body by the priests and an incense that may very well have contained psychoactive DMT (from acacia gum) was burned to receive inspiration.%0a
