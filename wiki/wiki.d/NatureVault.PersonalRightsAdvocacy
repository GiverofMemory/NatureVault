csum=Although the bible says that true religion is protecting orphans and widows, the extra rights of certain "protected groups" of people as declared by the government are abhorrent for me.  When I search for other groups and non profits that protect peoples rights, they are almost always only for certain classes like the elderly or disabled [[https://www.ldrfa.org/know-your-rights-become-your-own-self-advocate/|#]].  Of course I support these classes of people but for a group to turn someone away who needs help because they don't fit into a certain category of people is discrimination and is unconscionable and is the reason I feel the need to get involved.  These groups discriminate because US law discriminates and they know they can more easily win cases for disabled people.  Myself I am not compelled to win cases since I am not a legal representative, so I can fight for what I believe in, in protecting everyone's rights regardless of any factor or classification.  I am concerned about humans, period.

Instead of trying to create popular articles, PRA is focused on doing investigations to support people standing up for their own rights against governments or corporations or others who would try to restrict their rights.  Ideally the primary business model would be donations from those who want an investigation done and a report written about their rights being violated.  So ideally the business model would be pro bono for donation for the person(s) you are helping. For example if someone was evicted from their apartment for telling people how their landlord mistreated them.  PRA would do an investigation into the incident and find out what laws were violated by the landlord and write a report.  Other things that can be done is publish the story publicly by the organization itself and/or press release for news companies to pick up, and contact relevant authorities with the report like attorney generals.%0a%0aIt can be thought of like a "public investigator" as opposed to private.  PRA is all done in the open and not secretive to the person that hires them.  It should also be cheaper and less intensive than private investigation.  Also PRA doesn't try to focus on achieving a desired outcome for a client but rather that their rights are stood up for and protected in every way possible.  For example you could hire a private investigator to spy on an employee or friend or relative to dig up dirt on them to tarnish their reputation.  PRA would not do such a thing and only focuses on protecting individuals rights.%0a%0aThis is especially important in contracts that try to make people sign their rights away.  We consider the signing of your rights away as not a possible thing, we believe rights are inalienable which means inseparable from a person.%0a%0a!!Conspiracy against rights [[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/241|#]]%0a%0aWe are focused on "conspiracy against rights" and want to help correct any instance of a conspiracy to strip people of their God given and/or lawfully protected rights.%0a%0aThe statute says 2 or more persons conspiring, I believe a company with more than one employee that is trying to restrict rights would be considered "2 or more persons".%0a%0aWe are not so much focused on robberies or fights, more on deliberate calculated attempts to strip people of their rights, like leases, contracts, and other things.%0a%0a!!Next steps%0aAfter the report(s) and/or letter(s) have been written (and submitted if applicable), next steps can be these resources handed over to an attorney, private investigator, court, etc in order to assist in their investigations.%0a%0a!!Personal rights vs public rights%0a%0aWe focus on personal rights because we firmly believe that the only way to protect individual rights in this world is for the individuals themselves to stand up and demand it.  We are just here to support them in that endeavor so they can be an especially strong advocate for themselves.%0a%0a!!Protected groups%0a%0aAlthough the bible says that true religion is protecting orphans and widows, the extra rights of certain "protected groups" of people as declared by the government are abhorrent for me.

I am concerned about humans, period.%0a!!Relative vs absolute rights%0a%0aI don't believe rights are absolute but rather relative.  For example one person cannot kill another person, but that may change depending on what the other person has done. This means there may always be ambiguity to what rights a person has and that is open to moral and ethical conscience and decided by consensus of peers, like a jury.%0a%0a!!!Protests%0a%0aProtests may inadvertently limit the freedom of others as seen in the canadian trucker convoy and protest.  However context matters and the protest was in this example was against the "conspiracy against rights" of bodily autonomy committed by the canadian government against their people.  As long as the protesters aren't targeting others specifically with harassment, then it is justified in my opinion.  Freedom of speech includes honking a horn just like it includes raising of ones voice.  Total shutting down of the trucker convoy protest is also a violation and example of conspiracy against rights, in this case the right to protest and free speech.
