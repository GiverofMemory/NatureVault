csum=Tail emission is once a certain number of block reward halvings takes place, a fixed amount of coins will continue to be rewarded every block.  Common coins that do this are dogecoin and monero.  This will help prevent rapid deflation but is not enough to keep marketcap growing in the long run, in which the only viable solution that can last centuries and millenia are [[staticcoin]]s that increase the emission based on the number of people mining.
