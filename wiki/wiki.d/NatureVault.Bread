Great though for training [[lactobacillus]] to use amylase and create sourdough starter with [[l reuteri]] and [[s boulardii]].  Pregelatinized starches can be used up to about 10%25 in bread [[https://www.bakingbusiness.com/articles/34591-just-add-starch|#]]%0a%0aSince gelatinized starch doesn't seem to be able to sustain bubbles, it probably causes the air bubbles to collapse and form larger air pockets [[https://bakerpedia.com/processes/starch-gelatinization/|#]] which is desirable in artisan breads.

A $2.50 gallon of milk has 128g of protein, 2400 calories, which is 16 cups, so 4 cups is 32g which is added to the 226g in the flour when using grandma recipe which gives 258g protein. Since iron is added to flour I think 8 cups milk should be used per 5lb flour which gives 226+64= 290g of protein, 8250+1200= 9450 calories.%0a%0aCrystalization of yeast happens fastest at refrigerator temps as compared to room temp or freezer but can be reversed with heating [[https://www.seriouseats.com/does-refrigeration-really-ruin-bread|#]]%0a%0aSupermarket white bread recipe%0aIngredients you'll need: 3/4 cup (174g) water 1/2 cup (125g) whole milk 1 packet?

Amylase enzyme breaks down starch prevents crystalization, ascorbic acid strengthens dough gluten by oxidizing it and will help good rise, same with emulsifier - dough is all about expansion, steam makes a hard crust [[https://youtu.be/i3sP2jwG9jc|#]] also the lower the oxygen the more taste enhancing ethanol is produced, [[#note1]]that is why gina bread uses plastic to cover that touches the dough.
