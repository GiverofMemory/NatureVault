text=List of Abbreviations and Explanations %0a%0a%0a%0aAA— Arich Anpin— the Partzuf of Hochma, the central, initial Partzuf in the world %0aof Atzilut, from which all the other Partzuf im originate. %0a%0aAba— Father —the Partzuf of Hochma. %0a%0aIma— Mother— the Partzuf of Bina. %0a%0aZA—Zeir Anpin— Son (with regard to AVI). %0a%0aZON— ZA and ~Nukva— Malchut. %0a%0aNukva, Malchut— a Se/ira (singular for Sefirot) or Partzuf that receives from all %0athe preceding Partzufim (plural for Partzuf). Malchut of the world of Atzilut is the %0asum of all the creatures, all human souls. For this reason it is called Knesset Israel %0a(The Assembly of Israel). %0a%0aIsrael— the property of "bestowal," altruism. This is the property of the Creator, %0athe property of Bina. Israel derives from the Hebrew words Yashar— straight, and %0aEl— the Creator. Thus, Israel is the property of aspiring to attain equivalence of %0aform with the Creator. The "nations of the world" are the aspiration to selfish %0areception of pleasure. Naturally, these two properties are present in everyone, %0aand Kabbalah is the method for the development of the property of Israel within %0aman, with the purpose of attaining the Creator in this life. %0a%0aKli (vessel) egoistic desires and aspirations are not considered a Kli. A Kli is the %0acorrected desires, suitable for reception of Light. These are altruistic desires with %0aa screen that has transformed them from egoism into altruism. %0a%0aThe human heart that receives all sensations is called the Kli (vessel) of %0areception of sensations. The spiritual vessel, the only vessel that The Zohar speaks %0aof, is the desire to bestow upon the Creator: to hand over all of man's desires to %0athe Creator, as though saying that he agrees with all his heart to relinquish all of %0ahimself for His sake. Such a complete and true intention is called "Lishma" (for %0athe Creator's sake). %0a%0a21 %0a%0a%0a%0a22 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aSEFIROT %0a%0a%0aTHE CREATOR'S NAMES %0a%0a%0aKETER %0a%0a%0aEKYEhNAIeph-Hey-Yod-Hey %0a%0a%0aHOCHMA %0a%0a%0aYAhN Yod-Hey %0a%0a%0aBINA %0a%0a%0aHaVaYaH with Nikud Elokim %0a%0a%0aHESED %0a%0a%0aEL=Aleph-Lamed %0a%0a%0aGEVURA %0a%0a%0aELOKIM= Aleph-Lamed-Hey-Yod-Hey %0a%0a%0aTIFFERET %0a%0a%0aHaVaYaH with Nikud of Shvah-Holam-Kamatz %0a%0a%0aNETZAH and HOD %0a%0a%0aTZEVAOT %0a%0a%0aYESOD %0a%0a%0aSHADDAY=Shin-Dalet-Yod or EL=Aleph-Lamed CHAI=Chet-Yod %0a%0a%0aMALCHUT %0a%0a%0aADNNAIeph-Dalet-Nun-Yod %0a%0a%0a%0aMittuk (sweetening/mitigation) of a restriction law. Restriction is a ban for %0aMalchut to receive Light. This ban is lifted when Malchut is corrected by the %0aproperties of Bina. %0a%0aZivug— coupling— is translated as a sexual union between a man and a woman in %0athis world. Since spiritual actions are absolutely detached from the way we would %0anormally perceive them, I have chosen to use the Hebrew term Zivug, as it is more %0aabstractedly perceived by people with no knowledge of Hebrew. This will help %0aprevent confusions based on previously existing conceptions. The spiritual Zivug %0ais an aspiration of the Upper One (ZA— male part) to pass the Light (pleasure) %0ato the lower one (Malchut— female part). In doing so, both desires are completely %0aselfless, as in the example of the guest and the host. %0a%0aPBP— Panirn be Panirn (face to face). This state occurs when a Zachar (male Sefira), %0aor Aba (father), passes Ohr Hochma (Light of Wisdom) to the female Sefira, or %0aIma (mother), for the subsequent transfer to the children (ZON). The same %0arelationships of ABA (see below) and PBP also transpire between their children, %0aZON (ZA and Malchut). %0a%0aABA - Achor be Achor, back to back (pronounced Ach be Ach). If Partzuf Aba %0a(Hochma) has Ohr Hochma, but is unwilling to pass it on to Partzuf Ima (Bina), %0aand if Ima also does not want to receive it, such a relationship between them is %0acalled back to back. The same relationship can exist between ZA and Malchut. %0a%0aHesed— mercy, compassion, altruism, Ohr Hassadim (the Light of Mercy, %0acompassion, and altruism). It appears only within a Kli (desire) that wishes to %0a%0a%0a%0aList of Abbreviations and Explanations %0a%0a%0a%0a23 %0a%0a%0a%0agive selflessly and be similar to the Creator. This is the property of the Sefira or %0aPartzuf of Bina. Bina of the world of AK (Adam Kadmon) is called SAG. Bina of %0athe world of Atzilut is called Ima, the Supernal Mother, YESHSL/T, and AVI. %0aThe Light of Bina is the pleasure of being similar to the Creator's properties; %0ahence, this Light (sensation) is the most reliable protection from the impure %0aforces. And the Kli that possesses the properties of Bina is unable to transgress, %0aas its desire is solely to bestow. %0a%0aKHB— Keter-Hochma-Bina (pronounced Kahab). These are the first three Sefirot %0athat form the Rosh (head) of the Partzuf. The Rosh decides how much pleasure %0athe Partzuf can accept not for its own sake but for the sake of the Creator. This %0aLight descends from the Rosh to the Guf (body). %0a%0aHBD— Hochma-Bina-Daat (pronounced Habad). This is the same as Keter-Hochma- %0aBina (the Rosh of the Partzuf). Sefira Daat is not a Sefira, but the request (also %0aknown as MAN) of ZON (Zeir Anpin and Nukva). Daat is the appeal of ZON to %0aBina regarding their desire to receive Ohr Hochma from her. This prayer of ZON %0ais called MAN, for it ascends to Bina and evokes in Bina (Ima— their mother) the %0adesire to bestow upon her children— ZON. MAN in Bina is called Sefira Daat. %0aThis is not a Sefira like the other ten Sefirot; it is rather a request. However, to %0astress this state, we use the name HBD instead of KHB. %0a%0aHQT— Hesed-Gevura-Tifferet (pronounced Hagat). These are the Sefirot of the Guf %0a(body), similar to the Sefirot of the Rosh: Hesed is tantamount to Keter, Gevura is %0atantamount to Hochma, and Tifferet is tantamount to Bina. They are called GE %0a(see below) of the body. %0a%0aNHYM— Netzah-Hod-Yesod-Malchut (pronounced Nekim). These Sefirot receive %0afrom the Sefirot HGT (GE). Since they receive and have the will to receive, they %0aare called AHP of the body. %0a%0aQE— Galgalta-Eynaim (skull and eyes). Sefirot Keter-Hochma-and GAR of Bina. %0aThese Sefirot do not have the will to receive and wish only to bestow. Hence, %0athey cannot become egoistic. %0a%0aNRN— Nefesh-Ruach-Neshama (pronounced Naran). This is the Light that fills the %0asmall Partzuf. Katnut (small state) is when the Partzuf has the strength (a screen) %0aonly to bestow, but is unable to receive for the Creator's sake, despite its desire %0ato do so. In this case, the Partzuf has only Ohr Hassadim (Light of Mercy), but %0anot Ohr Hochma (Light of Wisdom). This is why it is considered a small Partzuf, %0awithout strength and reason, similar to a child in our world. %0a%0aAHP— Awzen-Hotem-Peh (ear-nose-mouth), pronounced Ahap. These are Sefirot %0aZAT of Bina-ZA-Malchut, which possess a will to receive. Therefore, in the %0a%0a%0a%0a24 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aabsence of a proper screen (resistance to that desire), they become egoistic. %0aA Partzuf without a screen on its AHP is called Katan (small) and its state is %0acalled Katnut (smallness, incompleteness). It is like a child in our world, as this %0aPartzuf, too, has no strength (screen), and can therefore have only Ohr Hassadim %0awithout Ohr Hochma). %0a%0aQadlut— big state. A Partzuf with a screen (strength to resist its egoistic nature) %0ato not only refrain from receiving for its own sake, but to receive not for its own %0asake (as in the example of the guest and the host. In this case, the Partzuf fills all %0aof its desires (all ten Sefirot) with the Lights of Hassadim and Hochma. %0a%0aFirst Big State— Gadlut Aleph, the attainment of the Light of Neshama. %0a%0aSecond Big State— Gadlut Bet, the attainment of the Light of Haya. %0a%0aOhr Hochma— Light of Wisdom. This Light fills the Kelim (vessels/ desires) of %0areception. It comes only if there is a screen on altruistic reception. %0a%0aAteret Yesod— literarily "foreskin," the place of union between Israel and the %0aCreator. After the second restriction, it is forbidden to make a Zivug (spiritual %0acoupling) on Malchut herself due to the absence of the screen. However, a %0aZivug can be made on the properties that Malchut received from ZA, called %0aAteret Yesod. Just as the desires of Malchut herself are cut off, the foreskin is %0acircumcised, and the desires that remain within her are those received from %0aZA, called Ateret Yesod. On these desires, Malchut can make a Zivug with ZA, %0aand receive the Light of Hochma. Naturally, this is not the same Light of %0aHochma that Malchut would receive if she were able to make a Zivug on her %0adesires, that is, on herself, on her own properties, called "the central point of %0acreation," the truly egoistic desires. Malchut will be able to do that only after %0a6,000 years, at the end of correction. But before that happens, these desires %0aare called the mark of union with the Creator, since a Zivug on Ateret Yesod %0abrings her closer to the Creator. %0a%0aAteret Yesod 1 is also Malchut de Malchut that remains after the circumcision, %0athe removal of the Orla (foreskin). This is the corrected part of Malchut, her %0aunification with Sefira Yesod, upon which a Zivug can be made while still during %0athe 6,000 years, thus bringing Malchut to the end of correction. %0a%0aNRNHY— Nefesh-Ruach-Neshama-Haya-Yechida (pronounced Naranhay). This %0aLight fills the big Partzuf, consisting of GE and AHP. %0a%0aOhr (Light)— pleasure, the sensation of the Creator. Ohr should always be inter- %0apreted as the same concept, for although the term is used in general, all of its %0asynonyms are implied! %0a%0a%0a%0aList of Abbreviations and Explanations %0a%0a%0a%0a25 %0a%0a%0a%0aKli (vessel)— desire, creature. Like Ohr, the word Kli is used in general, but all of %0aits synonyms are implied! %0a%0aQematria— numerical value of a letter, or a combination of letters and words. %0aThis is a special way of recording spiritual information. %0a%0aParsa— firmament, the division between the world of Atzilut and the worlds %0aBYA. The Parsa divides the ten Sefirot into two parts: the altruistic Kelim of %0abestowal (GAR, KHB, and GE) and the Kelim of reception (ZON or Bina-ZA- %0aMalchut), for Bina deliberately fell into ZA (AHP) with the purpose of correcting %0ahim. Malchut, which ascends above Bina and stands below Hochma, is called %0aParsa or "firmament," and separates GE from AHP. %0a%0aZAT, ZAK— the seven Sefirot Hesed, Gevura, Tifferet, Net^ah, Hod, Yesod, Malchut %0a(HGTNHYM). %0a%0aVAT, VAK— the six Sefirot Hesed, Gevura, Tifferet, Netzah, Hod, Yesod (HGT NHY, %0apronounced Hagat Nehy). %0a%0aDe - the preposition 'of in a possessive meaning. For example, Malchut de %0aAtzilut means Malchut of the world of Atzilut. %0a%0aEnglish translation— Whenever it says so in parenthesis, this refers to the %0abooks of the Torah (Pentateuch), Nevi'im (Prophets), and Ketuvim (Writings/ %0aHagiographa), published by Mosad HaRav Kook, in Hebrew with English %0atranslation. For example, (Yeshayahu, 11:9; English translation p. XXX, 9) means %0athat if you open page XXX in the book of Prophets, what you are looking for %0awill be in sentence number nine. When the original source is indicated, it is %0arecommended to refer to it there and then to read at least the passage that the %0aquoted saying is ascribed to. This will help you to see even more clearly that the %0aTorah, using an allegorical, figurative language, speaks only of the spiritual world %0aand man's ascension to it, and not at all about history or about our world. %0a%0aGarments— attributes, desires, Kelim. Generally, the garments in question are %0athose that Malchut receives from Bina. %0a%0aHuppah—a wedding baldachin, a canopy under which a marriage ceremony %0atakes place. %0a%0aNartik— the covering of ZA; same as the Huppah. %0a%0aAdornments— the Light of Hassadim, Light of Bina, which she passes into %0aMalchut. This corrects Malchut, and enables her to receive the Light of Hochma %0ain the Light of Hassadim. %0a%0aOrla— foreskin on the Sefira Yesod, the place of the Zivug between ZA and Malchut. %0aThe Orla must be removed, for during the 6,000 years, it is impossible to make %0a%0a%0a%0a26 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aa Zivug (intention) on Malchut herself and receive for the Creator's sake. Only a %0aZivug on the union of Malchut with ZA can be made. This is called Ateret Yesod, %0athe part of the Sefira Yesod that remains after the cutting off of the Orla. Orla is %0aalso Malchut de Malchut, or the impure forces. %0a%0aIma— Mother— Bina with regard to Malchut, who is the daughter. %0a%0aDaughter— Malchut with regard to Bina, mother. %0a%0aKodesh ha Kodas him— Holy of Holies— the Light of GAR— Neshama-Ha^a-Yechida. %0aQuestion— the sensation of lack of the Light of Hochma in Malchut. %0aSela— rock or truth. The name of Malchut. %0a%0aShechina— Divinity— the sensation (appearance, vision) of the Creator to those %0awho attain Him. Malchut in the state of reception of the Light (the Creator) is %0acalled Shechina. The sensation of the Creator, the place where one experiences %0athe Creator is called Shechina. %0a%0aTechum— zone— the distance beyond the bounds of which one is forbidden to %0ago on Shabbat (the Sabbath). Techum Shahhat constitutes the maximal distance %0awithin which one can move about during Sabbath. %0a%0aSigim— dross— impure desires that exist within pure desires. Man's work is to %0aseparate the two, and to gradually correct the Sigim. The term Sigim comes from %0aSAG, for they appeared as a result of the breaking of the Kelim of the world of %0aNelcudim, which refer to the system of the Partzufim of Partzuf SAG. The term %0aSigim found its way from Kabbalah into spoken Hebrew. %0a%0aSHACH-Shin-Cha/-300 + 20 = 320 fragments of the broken vessel. %0a%0aRAPACH-Reish-Peh-Chet-200 + 80 + 8 = 288 fragments of the broken vessel, %0awhich one can and must be corrected during the 6,000 years, by climbing the %0a6,000 steps of the spiritual ladder. %0a%0aLev ha Even— Stony Heart— Lev = Lamed-Bet = 30 + 2 = 32 fragments into which %0aMalchut had broken. These fragments of Malchut cannot be corrected and made %0aaltruistic; one can only refrain from using these desires. Lev ha Even is corrected %0aonly after the 6,000 years, that is, after the Creator Himself corrects the 288 %0afragments within man. It becomes completely altruistic and receives the name %0aLev Basar (heart of flesh). %0a%0aLo Lis hma— not for the sake of the Creator. Since nothing exists in creation but %0athe Creator and man, if something is not done "for the sake of the Creator," it is %0adone "for one's own sake." Thus, Lo Lishma denotes man's egoistic intention. %0a%0a%0a%0aList of Abbreviations and Explanations %0a%0a%0a%0a27 %0a%0a%0a%0aLishma— for the Creator's sake. Man's selfless intention to act only to please %0aand bring joy to the Creator. %0a%0aFour angels that participate in the creation of man— the four basic properties %0aof nature: mercy— Hesed, justice— Tzedek, truth— Emet, and peace— Shalom. %0a%0aEretz Israel— Land of Israel— Yetzira of this world. Yerushalaim (Jerusalem) is %0aAteret Yesod in Malchut. %0a%0a%0a%0aORIGINAL NAMES AND THEIR %0aEQUIVALENTS ACCEPTED IN THE %0aENGLISH TRANSLATION %0a%0a%0a%0aAaron - Aaron %0a%0a%0aLeah - Leah %0a%0a%0aAmon — Amnion %0a%0a%0aLilit - Lilith %0a%0a%0aAna'el — Anahel %0a%0a%0aiVfarharnfM — \4anniel %0a%0a%0aAnafiel — Anafiel %0a%0a%0aA/fatat — A/fptatrnn %0a%0a%0aAriel — Ariel %0a%0a%0aMicha - Micah %0a%0aA.T 11.V-1.1U 1*1 IV Lil L %0a%0a%0aAvraham — Abraham %0a%0a%0aMoav - Moab %0a%0a%0aRat Snpva — Ratnsnena %0a%0a%0aA.T IVlOllVv 1V1 V / JV/O %0a%0a%0aBenayahu - Benaiah %0a%0a%0aNachum - Nahum %0a%0a%0aBetzalel - Betzalel %0a%0a%0aNavuchadnetzar - Nebuchadnezzar %0a%0a%0aBil'am - Balaam %0a%0a%0aNechemia - Nehemiah %0a%0a%0aChagai - Haggai %0a%0a%0aNoach - Noah %0a%0a%0aChava - Eve %0a%0a%0aOvadia - Obadiah %0a%0a%0aEden - Eden %0a%0a%0aPetachia - Petahyah %0a%0a%0aEicha - Eichah %0a%0a%0aPinchas - Pinchas %0a%0a%0aElisha - Elisha %0a%0a%0aPisgania - Pesagniyah %0a%0a%0aEliyahu - Elijah %0a%0a%0aRahel - Rachel %0a%0a%0aEsav - Esau %0a%0a%0aRivka - Rebecca %0a%0a%0aEster - Esther %0a%0a%0aRut - Ruth %0a%0a%0aEzra - Ezra %0a%0a%0aSandalphon - Sandalphon %0a%0a%0aGavri'el - Gabriel %0a%0a%0aShet - Seth %0a%0a%0aGazaria - Gazardiel %0a%0a%0aShimon - Simeon %0a%0a%0aHanoch - Eunuch %0a%0a%0aShlomo - Solomon %0a%0a%0aHavakuk - Habakkuk %0a%0a%0aShmuel - Samuel %0a%0a%0alyov - Job %0a%0a%0aTamar - Tamar %0a%0a%0aKorach - Korach %0a%0a%0aTzefania - Zephaniah %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aTzur - Tyre %0aYaakov - Jacob %0aYehoyada - Jehoiada %0aYechezkel - Ezekiel %0aYehoshua - Joshua %0aYehudah - Judah %0aYerushalaim - Jerusalem %0a%0a%0a%0aYeshayahu - Isaiah %0aYirmiyahu - Jeremiah %0aYishmael - Ishmael %0aYitzchak - Isaac %0aYosef - Joseph %0aZachariah - Zechariah %0aZvuliel - Zebuliel %0a%0a%0a%0aORIGINAL TITLES AND THEIR %0aEQUIVALENTS ACCEPTED IN THE %0aENGLISH TRANSLATION %0a%0a%0a%0aBeresheet - Genesis %0a%0aShemot - Exodus %0a%0aVayikra - Leviticus %0a%0aBamidbar - Numbers %0a%0aDevarim - Deuteronomy %0a%0aKohelet - Ecclesiastes %0a%0aShmuel 1 and 2 - Samuel 1 and 2 %0a%0aMelachim 1 and 2 - Kings 1 and 2 %0a%0aDivrey HaYamim - Chronicles %0a%0aMishley - Proverbs %0a%0aTehilim - Psalms %0a%0aShir HaShirim - Song of Songs %0a%0aShoftim - Judges

The spiritual Zivug %0a%3c is an aspiration of the Upper One (ZA— male part) to pass the Light (pleasure) %0a%3c to the lower one (Malchut— female part).

This state occurs when a Zachar (male Sefira), %0a%3c or Aba (father), passes Ohr Hochma (Light of Wisdom) to the female Sefira, or %0a%3c Ima (mother), for the subsequent transfer to the children (ZON).

If Partzuf Aba %0a%3c (Hochma) has Ohr Hochma, but is unwilling to pass it on to Partzuf Ima (Bina), %0a%3c and if Ima also does not want to receive it, such a relationship between them is %0a%3c called back to back. The same relationship can exist between ZA and Malchut. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hesed— mercy, compassion, altruism, Ohr Hassadim (the Light of Mercy, %0a%3c compassion, and altruism). It appears only within a Kli (desire) that wishes to %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c List of Abbreviations and Explanations %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 23 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c give selflessly and be similar to the Creator. This is the property of the Sefira or %0a%3c Partzuf of Bina. Bina of the world of AK (Adam Kadmon) is called SAG. Bina of %0a%3c the world of Atzilut is called Ima, the Supernal Mother, YESHSL/T, and AVI. %0a%3c The Light of Bina is the pleasure of being similar to the Creator's properties; %0a%3c hence, this Light (sensation) is the most reliable protection from the impure %0a%3c forces. And the Kli that possesses the properties of Bina is unable to transgress, %0a%3c as its desire is solely to bestow. %0a%3c %0a%3c KHB— Keter-Hochma-Bina (pronounced Kahab). These are the first three Sefirot %0a%3c that form the Rosh (head) of the Partzuf. The Rosh decides how much pleasure %0a%3c the Partzuf can accept not for its own sake but for the sake of the Creator. This %0a%3c Light descends from the Rosh to the Guf (body). %0a%3c %0a%3c HBD— Hochma-Bina-Daat (pronounced Habad). This is the same as Keter-Hochma- %0a%3c Bina (the Rosh of the Partzuf). Sefira Daat is not a Sefira, but the request (also %0a%3c known as MAN) of ZON (Zeir Anpin and Nukva). Daat is the appeal of ZON to %0a%3c Bina regarding their desire to receive Ohr Hochma from her. This prayer of ZON %0a%3c is called MAN, for it ascends to Bina and evokes in Bina (Ima— their mother) the %0a%3c desire to bestow upon her children— ZON. MAN in Bina is called Sefira Daat. %0a%3c This is not a Sefira like the other ten Sefirot; it is rather a request. However, to %0a%3c stress this state, we use the name HBD instead of KHB. %0a%3c %0a%3c HQT— Hesed-Gevura-Tifferet (pronounced Hagat). These are the Sefirot of the Guf %0a%3c (body), similar to the Sefirot of the Rosh: Hesed is tantamount to Keter, Gevura is %0a%3c tantamount to Hochma, and Tifferet is tantamount to Bina. They are called GE %0a%3c (see below) of the body. %0a%3c %0a%3c NHYM— Netzah-Hod-Yesod-Malchut (pronounced Nekim). These Sefirot receive %0a%3c from the Sefirot HGT (GE). Since they receive and have the will to receive, they %0a%3c are called AHP of the body. %0a%3c %0a%3c QE— Galgalta-Eynaim (skull and eyes). Sefirot Keter-Hochma-and GAR of Bina. %0a%3c These Sefirot do not have the will to receive and wish only to bestow. Hence, %0a%3c they cannot become egoistic. %0a%3c %0a%3c NRN— Nefesh-Ruach-Neshama (pronounced Naran). This is the Light that fills the %0a%3c small Partzuf. Katnut (small state) is when the Partzuf has the strength (a screen) %0a%3c only to bestow, but is unable to receive for the Creator's sake, despite its desire %0a%3c to do so. In this case, the Partzuf has only Ohr Hassadim (Light of Mercy), but %0a%3c not Ohr Hochma (Light of Wisdom). This is why it is considered a small Partzuf, %0a%3c without strength and reason, similar to a child in our world. %0a%3c %0a%3c AHP— Awzen-Hotem-Peh (ear-nose-mouth), pronounced Ahap. These are Sefirot %0a%3c ZAT of Bina-ZA-Malchut, which possess a will to receive. Therefore, in the %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 24 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c absence of a proper screen (resistance to that desire), they become egoistic. %0a%3c A Partzuf without a screen on its AHP is called Katan (small) and its state is %0a%3c called Katnut (smallness, incompleteness). It is like a child in our world, as this %0a%3c Partzuf, too, has no strength (screen), and can therefore have only Ohr Hassadim %0a%3c without Ohr Hochma). %0a%3c %0a%3c Qadlut— big state. A Partzuf with a screen (strength to resist its egoistic nature) %0a%3c to not only refrain from receiving for its own sake, but to receive not for its own %0a%3c sake (as in the example of the guest and the host. In this case, the Partzuf fills all %0a%3c of its desires (all ten Sefirot) with the Lights of Hassadim and Hochma. %0a%3c %0a%3c First Big State— Gadlut Aleph, the attainment of the Light of Neshama. %0a%3c %0a%3c Second Big State— Gadlut Bet, the attainment of the Light of Haya. %0a%3c %0a%3c Ohr Hochma— Light of Wisdom. This Light fills the Kelim (vessels/ desires) of %0a%3c reception. It comes only if there is a screen on altruistic reception. %0a%3c %0a%3c Ateret Yesod— literarily "foreskin," the place of union between Israel and the %0a%3c Creator. After the second restriction, it is forbidden to make a Zivug (spiritual %0a%3c coupling) on Malchut herself due to the absence of the screen. However, a %0a%3c Zivug can be made on the properties that Malchut received from ZA, called %0a%3c Ateret Yesod. Just as the desires of Malchut herself are cut off, the foreskin is %0a%3c circumcised, and the desires that remain within her are those received from %0a%3c ZA, called Ateret Yesod. On these desires, Malchut can make a Zivug with ZA, %0a%3c and receive the Light of Hochma. Naturally, this is not the same Light of %0a%3c Hochma that Malchut would receive if she were able to make a Zivug on her %0a%3c desires, that is, on herself, on her own properties, called "the central point of %0a%3c creation," the truly egoistic desires. Malchut will be able to do that only after %0a%3c 6,000 years, at the end of correction. But before that happens, these desires %0a%3c are called the mark of union with the Creator, since a Zivug on Ateret Yesod %0a%3c brings her closer to the Creator. %0a%3c %0a%3c Ateret Yesod 1 is also Malchut de Malchut that remains after the circumcision, %0a%3c the removal of the Orla (foreskin). This is the corrected part of Malchut, her %0a%3c unification with Sefira Yesod, upon which a Zivug can be made while still during %0a%3c the 6,000 years, thus bringing Malchut to the end of correction. %0a%3c %0a%3c NRNHY— Nefesh-Ruach-Neshama-Haya-Yechida (pronounced Naranhay). This %0a%3c Light fills the big Partzuf, consisting of GE and AHP. %0a%3c %0a%3c Ohr (Light)— pleasure, the sensation of the Creator. Ohr should always be inter- %0a%3c preted as the same concept, for although the term is used in general, all of its %0a%3c synonyms are implied! %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c List of Abbreviations and Explanations %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 25 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Kli (vessel)— desire, creature. Like Ohr, the word Kli is used in general, but all of %0a%3c its synonyms are implied! %0a%3c %0a%3c Qematria— numerical value of a letter, or a combination of letters and words. %0a%3c This is a special way of recording spiritual information. %0a%3c %0a%3c Parsa— firmament, the division between the world of Atzilut and the worlds %0a%3c BYA. The Parsa divides the ten Sefirot into two parts: the altruistic Kelim of %0a%3c bestowal (GAR, KHB, and GE) and the Kelim of reception (ZON or Bina-ZA- %0a%3c Malchut), for Bina deliberately fell into ZA (AHP) with the purpose of correcting %0a%3c him. Malchut, which ascends above Bina and stands below Hochma, is called %0a%3c Parsa or "firmament," and separates GE from AHP. %0a%3c %0a%3c ZAT, ZAK— the seven Sefirot Hesed, Gevura, Tifferet, Net^ah, Hod, Yesod, Malchut %0a%3c (HGTNHYM). %0a%3c %0a%3c VAT, VAK— the six Sefirot Hesed, Gevura, Tifferet, Netzah, Hod, Yesod (HGT NHY, %0a%3c pronounced Hagat Nehy). %0a%3c %0a%3c De - the preposition 'of in a possessive meaning. For example, Malchut de %0a%3c Atzilut means Malchut of the world of Atzilut. %0a%3c %0a%3c English translation— Whenever it says so in parenthesis, this refers to the %0a%3c books of the Torah (Pentateuch), Nevi'im (Prophets), and Ketuvim (Writings/ %0a%3c Hagiographa), published by Mosad HaRav Kook, in Hebrew with English %0a%3c translation. For example, (Yeshayahu, 11:9; English translation p. XXX, 9) means %0a%3c that if you open page XXX in the book of Prophets, what you are looking for %0a%3c will be in sentence number nine. When the original source is indicated, it is %0a%3c recommended to refer to it there and then to read at least the passage that the %0a%3c quoted saying is ascribed to. This will help you to see even more clearly that the %0a%3c Torah, using an allegorical, figurative language, speaks only of the spiritual world %0a%3c and man's ascension to it, and not at all about history or about our world. %0a%3c %0a%3c Garments— attributes, desires, Kelim. Generally, the garments in question are %0a%3c those that Malchut receives from Bina. %0a%3c %0a%3c Huppah—a wedding baldachin, a canopy under which a marriage ceremony %0a%3c takes place. %0a%3c %0a%3c Nartik— the covering of ZA; same as the Huppah. %0a%3c %0a%3c Adornments— the Light of Hassadim, Light of Bina, which she passes into %0a%3c Malchut. This corrects Malchut, and enables her to receive the Light of Hochma %0a%3c in the Light of Hassadim. %0a%3c %0a%3c Orla— foreskin on the Sefira Yesod, the place of the Zivug between ZA and Malchut. %0a%3c The Orla must be removed, for during the 6,000 years, it is impossible to make %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 26 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c a Zivug (intention) on Malchut herself and receive for the Creator's sake. Only a %0a%3c Zivug on the union of Malchut with ZA can be made. This is called Ateret Yesod, %0a%3c the part of the Sefira Yesod that remains after the cutting off of the Orla. Orla is %0a%3c also Malchut de Malchut, or the impure forces. %0a%3c %0a%3c Ima— Mother— Bina with regard to Malchut, who is the daughter. %0a%3c %0a%3c Daughter— Malchut with regard to Bina, mother. %0a%3c %0a%3c Kodesh ha Kodas him— Holy of Holies— the Light of GAR— Neshama-Ha^a-Yechida. %0a%3c Question— the sensation of lack of the Light of Hochma in Malchut. %0a%3c Sela— rock or truth. The name of Malchut. %0a%3c %0a%3c Shechina— Divinity— the sensation (appearance, vision) of the Creator to those %0a%3c who attain Him. Malchut in the state of reception of the Light (the Creator) is %0a%3c called Shechina. The sensation of the Creator, the place where one experiences %0a%3c the Creator is called Shechina. %0a%3c %0a%3c Techum— zone— the distance beyond the bounds of which one is forbidden to %0a%3c go on Shabbat (the Sabbath). Techum Shahhat constitutes the maximal distance %0a%3c within which one can move about during Sabbath. %0a%3c %0a%3c Sigim— dross— impure desires that exist within pure desires. Man's work is to %0a%3c separate the two, and to gradually correct the Sigim. The term Sigim comes from %0a%3c SAG, for they appeared as a result of the breaking of the Kelim of the world of %0a%3c Nelcudim, which refer to the system of the Partzufim of Partzuf SAG. The term %0a%3c Sigim found its way from Kabbalah into spoken Hebrew. %0a%3c %0a%3c SHACH-Shin-Cha/-300 + 20 = 320 fragments of the broken vessel. %0a%3c %0a%3c RAPACH-Reish-Peh-Chet-200 + 80 + 8 = 288 fragments of the broken vessel, %0a%3c which one can and must be corrected during the 6,000 years, by climbing the %0a%3c 6,000 steps of the spiritual ladder. %0a%3c %0a%3c Lev ha Even— Stony Heart— Lev = Lamed-Bet = 30 + 2 = 32 fragments into which %0a%3c Malchut had broken. These fragments of Malchut cannot be corrected and made %0a%3c altruistic; one can only refrain from using these desires. Lev ha Even is corrected %0a%3c only after the 6,000 years, that is, after the Creator Himself corrects the 288 %0a%3c fragments within man. It becomes completely altruistic and receives the name %0a%3c Lev Basar (heart of flesh). %0a%3c %0a%3c Lo Lis hma— not for the sake of the Creator. Since nothing exists in creation but %0a%3c the Creator and man, if something is not done "for the sake of the Creator," it is %0a%3c done "for one's own sake." Thus, Lo Lishma denotes man's egoistic intention. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c List of Abbreviations and Explanations %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 27 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Lishma— for the Creator's sake. Man's selfless intention to act only to please %0a%3c and bring joy to the Creator. %0a%3c %0a%3c Four angels that participate in the creation of man— the four basic properties %0a%3c of nature: mercy— Hesed, justice— Tzedek, truth— Emet, and peace— Shalom. %0a%3c %0a%3c Eretz Israel— Land of Israel— Yetzira of this world. Yerushalaim (Jerusalem) is %0a%3c Ateret Yesod in Malchut. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ORIGINAL NAMES AND THEIR %0a%3c EQUIVALENTS ACCEPTED IN THE %0a%3c ENGLISH TRANSLATION %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Aaron - Aaron %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Leah - Leah %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Amon — Amnion %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Lilit - Lilith %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Ana'el — Anahel %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c iVfarharnfM — \4anniel %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Anafiel — Anafiel %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c A/fatat — A/fptatrnn %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Ariel — Ariel %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Micha - Micah %0a%3c %0a%3c A.T 11.V-1.1U 1*1 IV Lil L %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Avraham — Abraham %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Moav - Moab %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Rat Snpva — Ratnsnena %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c A.T IVlOllVv 1V1 V / JV/O %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Benayahu - Benaiah %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Nachum - Nahum %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Betzalel - Betzalel %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Navuchadnetzar - Nebuchadnezzar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Bil'am - Balaam %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Nechemia - Nehemiah %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chagai - Haggai %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Noach - Noah %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chava - Eve %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Ovadia - Obadiah %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Eden - Eden %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Petachia - Petahyah %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Eicha - Eichah %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Pinchas - Pinchas %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Elisha - Elisha %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Pisgania - Pesagniyah %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Eliyahu - Elijah %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Rahel - Rachel %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Esav - Esau %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Rivka - Rebecca %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Ester - Esther %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Rut - Ruth %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Ezra - Ezra %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Sandalphon - Sandalphon %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Gavri'el - Gabriel %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Shet - Seth %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Gazaria - Gazardiel %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Shimon - Simeon %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Hanoch - Eunuch %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Shlomo - Solomon %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Havakuk - Habakkuk %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Shmuel - Samuel %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c lyov - Job %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Tamar - Tamar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Korach - Korach %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Tzefania - Zephaniah %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Tzur - Tyre %0a%3c Yaakov - Jacob %0a%3c Yehoyada - Jehoiada %0a%3c Yechezkel - Ezekiel %0a%3c Yehoshua - Joshua %0a%3c Yehudah - Judah %0a%3c Yerushalaim - Jerusalem %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Yeshayahu - Isaiah %0a%3c Yirmiyahu - Jeremiah %0a%3c Yishmael - Ishmael %0a%3c Yitzchak - Isaac %0a%3c Yosef - Joseph %0a%3c Zachariah - Zechariah %0a%3c Zvuliel - Zebuliel %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ORIGINAL TITLES AND THEIR %0a%3c EQUIVALENTS ACCEPTED IN THE %0a%3c ENGLISH TRANSLATION %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Beresheet - Genesis %0a%3c %0a%3c Shemot - Exodus %0a%3c %0a%3c Vayikra - Leviticus %0a%3c %0a%3c Bamidbar - Numbers %0a%3c %0a%3c Devarim - Deuteronomy %0a%3c %0a%3c Kohelet - Ecclesiastes %0a%3c %0a%3c Shmuel 1 and 2 - Samuel 1 and 2 %0a%3c %0a%3c Melachim 1 and 2 - Kings 1 and 2 %0a%3c %0a%3c Divrey HaYamim - Chronicles %0a%3c %0a%3c Mishley - Proverbs %0a%3c %0a%3c Tehilim - Psalms %0a%3c %0a%3c Shir HaShirim - Song of Songs %0a%3c %0a%3c Shoftim - Judges %0a\ No newline at end of file%0a
