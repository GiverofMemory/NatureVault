How long the blocktime is has nothing to do with security, the only factor is total time since it was first included in a block.  Sadly now bitcoin is backlogged and often runs 12 hours before the first confirmation, so every other coin has a huge head start.  Secondly, you cannot compare security in hashrate or even power consumption across algorithms.  So while the security calculations you have for bitcoin cash are likely somewhat accurate (although it doesn't take into account the 10 block rolling checkpoints), they are not accurate at all for scrypt coins like litecoin/doge or CPU coins like monero.  1 TH of sha256 does not equal 1 TH of RandomX in terms of security.  All that matters is how difficult it would be to achieve 51%25 of the hashrate.  In fact, other algorithms are just as secure as bitcoin just as long as the coin you are considering is the largest currently using the algorithm, and another benefit to an inherently slower algo is that you get the same security as bitcoin (there simply isn't extra scrypt miners in the world that could be brought in or immediately made to attack the network) for a fraction of the energy cost.  In fact, due to the current profitability there are probably more sha256 miners sitting idle that could be used to attack the network than there are scrypt miners.
