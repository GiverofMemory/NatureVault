csum=A total lack of normal PrP is associated with mild difference from normal mice [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2634447/|#]].  They lack the ability to get infected with misfolded prions and thus resistant against Alzheimer's nd other prion diseases.  They have a bit more fragmented sleep but are resistant against circadian rhythm change.  They may have slightly less [[antioxidant]] power and would need to supplement antioxidants.  They have more active phagocytosis so this would be one reason they would resist prion diseases and also other bacterial infections and perhapse intracellular parasites like [[brucella]], perhaps [[toxoplasmosis]]? Knockouts are more susceptible to [[seizures]].  Certain types of [[memory]] might be negatively effected slightly.  Knockouts may have increased damage and reduced adaptation to [[stroke]].  Knockouts might be suseptible to [[myelin]] degeneration.  Knockout stem cells are bad at self renewal, they run out, but can be rescued by adding PrP.  PRP protein most similar to DPL, I wonder if there are any food or herbal sources of something similar that can rescue PrP knockouts?  Like something that could be in the [[tree of life]]?  Perhaps the choice was stay in wonderland where you need the tree of life but will never die due to prions, or choose the [[tree of knowledge]] and be able to survive in the wild but eventually succumb to prion misfolding and die.
