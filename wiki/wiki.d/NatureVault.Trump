This has never happened before in the entire 300 year history of America.  This begins the full split of american society where the government sets themselves in an untenable position fully in opposition to the american people.

The deep state GOP with mike pence as their poster child have almost invariably failed to win primaries against trump.  So the only question is does trump want to keep the republican name or change it up.
