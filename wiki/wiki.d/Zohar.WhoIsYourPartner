text=Who Is Your Partner? %0a%0a%0a%0a61. Beresheet: Rabbi Shimon opened: "Put my words in your mouth. How %0amuch effort should man exert in the Torah day and night, for the Creator is %0aattentive to those who study it. And with every word that man attains by his %0aefforts in the Torah, he builds a firmament." %0a%0aThe Creator gave the righteous the power of His speech. And just as the %0aCreator creates the creature by the power of His word, so the righteous create %0anew Heavens by its power. This is why Rabbi Shimon opened his speech by %0aexplaining the words, "In the beginning, the Creator created Heaven and %0aearth," as the word Barah (created) also means "closing" and "limiting." And %0awe must understand why the Creator had created it in such a closed form. %0aHe answers, "To put the correction of Heaven and earth in the words of %0athe righteous, to make them His partners— participants in the creation of %0aHeaven and earth." %0a%0aThere are two kinds of renewal of Heaven and earth that the Creator %0aenclosed in the mouths of the righteous: %0a%0a1. The correction of Adam's sin, the correction of the past. Even before %0athe creation of Adam, the Creator had made a secret correction of Heaven and %0aearth, as it is described in the beginning of the Torah, in the chapter Beresheet: %0aZON de Atzilut ascended to AVI and to AA, while Adam ascended to ZON %0aand YESHSUT. As a result, Adam received the Light of NRN de Atzilut, for he %0aclothed YESHSUT and ZON de Atzilut, i.e., ascended to their level. %0a%0aAdam is located within the worlds BYA and he ascends together with these %0aworlds. All the worlds can ascend above their permanent state or descend to %0atheir places with Adam inside of them. Adam's spiritual level and the Light that %0ahe receives are determined by his location (see page 212). %0a%0a209 %0a%0a%0a%0a210 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aDURING ASCENT %0a%0a%0a%0aPERMANENT STATE %0a%0a%0a%0aAtik %0a%0a%0a%0aAVI %0a%0a%0a%0aAA %0a%0a%0a%0aZON %0a%0a%0a%0aAVI %0a%0a%0a%0aAdam - Beria %0a%0a%0a%0aYESHSUT + ZON %0a%0a%0a%0aParsa of the world of Atzilut %0a%0a%0a%0aAdam - Yetzira %0a%0a%0a%0aBeria %0a%0a%0a%0aAdam - Assiya %0a%0a%0a%0aYetzira %0a%0a%0a%0aAssiya %0a%0a%0a%0aIn other sources, such as the Talmud {Bava Batra, 58:2), this is described %0aas Adam's ascent to the level of the sun (ZA de Atzilut). This Light is called %0a"Zihara Ilaa" (Zihara is the Aramaic word for Zohar in Hebrew or "radiant %0aLight" in English). %0a%0aAs a result of his sin, Adam fell spiritually to the level of our corporeal world %0a(Talmud, Hagigah, 12:1). And instead of NRN de Atzilut that he used to receive %0abefore his fall, he now receives the Light from the worlds BYA that are below %0aParsa. And as a result of Adam's sin, Heaven (ZA) and earth (Malchut) of the %0aworld of Atzilut descended to the level of VAK de ZA and the point of Malchut %0arespectively, as they descended below Tahur de Partzuf AA. %0a%0aAnd the righteous that live in this world, but already exist spiritually in %0athe spiritual worlds of BYA, are entrusted with the task of correcting all that %0atranspired through Adam's fault, and to return, to renew the Heavens and the %0aearth (ZON de Atzilut) and elevate them to AVI and AA— ZA to AA and Malchut %0ato AVI, as it was before the sin. And as a result of their work, the righteous will %0areceive the Light of the world of Atzilut that the corrected Adam is entitled to, %0afor they (their souls, spiritual Kelim or inner spiritual Partzuf) are his parts. %0a%0a2. However, even before the sin, Adam was not in the perfect state for which %0athe Creator had created him. Hence, after the righteous correct the consequences %0aof Adam's sin and attain NRN de Atzilut, which existed in Adam before the sin, %0anew work awaits them— to receive new Upper Light that has yet to descend. In %0aother words, if the first goal is to correct the sin, the second is to attain even %0amore. It is called to "create new Heaven and earth," new properties of ZON, in %0awhich new, Higher Light can be received. %0a%0aThis new level or degree that has never been present in any Kli is described %0aas "neither hath an eye seen the Creator beside thee," and the degrees which %0a%0a%0a%0aWho Is Your Partner? %0a%0a%0a%0a211 %0a%0a%0a%0athe righteous attach to the worlds are called "new Heaven" and "new earth," for %0athey are truly new and have never before existed in reality. %0a%0aAnd this Heaven and earth, which the righteous correct to the level that %0apreceded Adam's sin, during the creation (Beresheet), are not called new, as they've %0aalready existed and the Creator Himself corrected them even before Adam's sin. %0aHence, they are called renewed, and the righteous who correct them are not %0acalled the Creator's partners. %0a%0a"Encloses in their mouths" implies reception of such Upper Light that was %0aneither received by Adam nor emanated from the Creator. And now, by the %0aactions of the righteous, which are called partners, participants and co-creators, %0ait comes out and shines in creation. Thus we see that all the righteous are %0adivided into two groups: those who correct Adam's sin and those who create %0anew degrees of attainment. The latter are called the Creator's partners. %0a%0aZA is called voice and Malchut is called speech. When a righteous person %0astudies the Torah and thereby raises MAN (by the voice and speech of his To rah) %0afrom his soul to ZON, his voice ascends to ZA and his speech ascends to Malchut. %0aThe voice of the Torah that ascends with MAN to ZA is called the Creator %0a(Kadosh Baruch Hu). %0a%0aAlso, each renewed word in the Torah builds a new firmament. A word %0ameans speech, and any speech that renews the Torah by those who study it %0aascends in the form of MAN to Malchut, who is called "word and speech." This %0acreates a new firmament in the form of a screen, on which a Zivug between the %0aCreator and the Shechina is made. This is what the righteous, who study the %0aTorah, attain by raising MAN! %0a%0aHowever, renewal in the words of the Torah does not imply anything new %0ain the voice of the Torah. For Malchut has to recreate herself for each new Zivug, %0afor after each Zivug, Malchut returns to the state of virginity thanks to the MAN %0araised by the righteous, who constantly renew her properties, her Yesod— the %0aKli for the reception of Light from ZA. Hence, it is written that the Torah is %0arenewed by each word, for a word (Malchut) is renewed by the speech of the %0arighteous in the Torah, as, after each Zivug, the previous Kli disappears and a %0anew one appears. %0a%0a62. We have learned that just as the Torah is renewed by one's mouth, that %0arenewal ascends and appears before the Creator. And the Creator accepts this %0awisdom, kisses it, and adorns it with seventy adornments. And the renewed %0awisdom itself ascends and settles on the head of the righteous that revive the %0a%0a%0a%0a212 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aworlds, and then flies, soaring through 70,000 worlds, until it ascends to Atik, %0athe Sefira Keter. And all that exists in Atik is concealed, Supernal wisdom. %0a%0aWhen a person raises MAN from his Torah, this word, which is Nukva de %0aZA, ascends and connects to the Creator in a Zivug with Him. The Creator takes %0athis word, kisses, and adorns it, and these are the two types of Zivugim (plural %0afor Zivug) in ZON: %0a%0a1. Zivug de Neshikin (kisses); %0a%0a2. Zivug de Yesodot (bases/ foundations). %0a%0aEach Zivug consists of two Zivugim, for a Zivug on Ohr Hochma must clothe %0aitself into the Partzuf (garment) of Ohr Hassadim. Therefore, a preliminary Zivug %0amust be made on Ohr Hassadim, whose role is to become a garment for Ohr %0aHochma. This is why each Zivug consists of two Zivugim: %0a%0a1. Zivug on the degree of Hochma, called Zivug de Neshikin, because it %0astands at the Peh de Rosh of the Partzuf, at the level of Rosh and GAR. %0a%0a2. Zivug on the degree of Hassadim, called Zivug de Yesodot, because it %0atakes place at the level of the bodies of the Partzufim. %0a%0aTherefore, it is said that the Creator took Nukva in this word and kissed her, %0ai.e., made a Zivug de Neshikin at the level of GAR, and then adorned her, i.e., %0amade a Zivug de Yesodot at the level of Hassadim. As a result, Ohr Hochma clothed %0ain Ohr Hassadim, and Nukva received the complete Light. %0a%0aIN SEVENTY ADORNMENTS: the complete Light of Nuba is called %0a"seventy adornments," because Malchut is the seventh day, and when she receives %0afrom ZA, her Sefirot become tens, just as the Sefirot of ZA; this turns Malchut into %0a7 x 10 = 70. Mochin (wisdom), Ohr Hochma is called Atara (adornment or crown). %0aHence, what she receives is called "seventy adornments." After Malchut receives %0athe Light of Hassadim, with the help of the MAN of the righteous, she becomes %0afit to receive the Upper Light of Hochma, the seventy adornments. %0a%0aAs was said above, there are two kinds of renewal of Heaven and earth (ZON): %0a%0a1. When everything returns to the state preceding Adam's sin. In that %0ainstance, Malchut is called the "word of the Torah" ( VAK), where the %0aTorah is ZA. %0a%0a2. When Heaven and earth are created with a new Light, which even Adam %0adid not attain prior to his sin. And this attainable word is called GAR. %0a%0aIt is written (Talmud, Berachot, 7:1) that the righteous sit with adornments %0aon their heads, for Malchut ascended to adorn the head of the righteous (ZA) %0a%0a%0a%0aWho Is Your Partner? %0a%0a%0a%0a213 %0a%0a%0a%0ain his Yesod, called Chai Qlamim (reviver of worlds), or, rather, in his Ateret %0aYesod-the place of circumcision. And this transpires thanks to the MAN raised %0aby the righteous that have already attained the Upper Light of Adam's Zihara %0allaa, just as Rabbi Shimon and his friends have already attained it. %0a%0aOhr Hochma is called Ohr Haya. Since ZA desires only Hassadim, he can %0areceive Ohr Haya only with the help of his Nukva, Malchut. It turns out that %0aZA lives, i.e., receives Ohr Haya, only if he is in a Zivug with Nukva, called Olam %0a(world). That is how the name Chai Olamim (reviver of worlds) originated. %0a%0aAlso, Nukva, the adornment on his head, becomes important (Keter - crown) %0abecause ZA receives this Light only thanks to his Malchut. Although Malchut was %0aborn from ZA, since it is Malchut and no other that evokes, makes reception of %0athe Light of Life possible, ZA calls her his mother. Indeed, ZA receives Ohr Ha^a %0a(the Light of Life) from her. %0a%0aTherefore, it is written that Malchut flies and soars in 70,000 worlds, and %0aafter her Zivug with ZA on his Atara (adornment on his head), she ascends even %0ahigher, to AA, where the seven Sefirot of Malchut, called 70,000 worlds, become %0acorrected, as one Sefira of ZA equals 10,000. After that, Malchut ascends higher %0astill— to Atik. And all of these ascents of ZON to Atilc transpire thanks to the %0aefforts made by the righteous that raise MAN: a Zivug on Atara elevates ZON to %0aAVI, from which they ascend to AA (70,000 worlds), and from there to Atik, the %0ahighest possible point of ascent. %0a%0aIt is therefore written that all the words of Atik 's Supernal wisdom are locked, %0asince Malchut receives the Upper Light upon ascending to Atik, and each degree %0athat she receives from Atik is called "concealed," "Supernal wisdom," i.e., GAR %0ade Hochma. This is because words of wisdom signify the degree of Hochma, and %0athe words "concealed," "secret," and "Supernal" refer to GAR. Also, they are %0arevealed only to those who attain the level of Atik, but not below, as Tzimtzum %0aBet (the second restriction) already exists in AA. %0a%0a63. And when this hidden wisdom, which is renewed here in this world, %0aascends, she joins Atik, ascends and descends, enters 18 worlds, where no %0aeye has seen the Creator besides you. They emerge from there and appear %0abefore Atik, complete and perfect. Meanwhile, Atik tests her and finds her %0amost desirable above all else. He then takes her and adorns her with 370,000 %0aadornments. And she, the renewed Torah, ascends and descends, and is %0atransformed into a firmament. %0a%0aDuring the ascent of Malchut to Atik, she joins the Zivug that transpires %0athere, and creates Ohr Hoxer (Returning Light) by accepting Ohr Yashar (Direct %0a%0a%0a%0a214 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aLight) at the level of Atik's properties. The ascent of Malchut means that Malchut %0aelevates Ohr Hozer from herself upwards. Malchut's descent means that she sends %0aOhr Yashar from Above downwards. And then Malchut receives the hidden, %0asecret, and Supernal wisdom. The word "joins" signifies her contact with the %0aOhr Hozer and the Ohr Yashar within Atik itself. %0a%0aThis Zivug is made in Atik on its Yesod, but not on Malchut, since Malchut de %0aAtik is concealed until the end of correction. Like Yesod de ZA during its ascent %0ato AVI, this Yesod is called Chai Olamim. The difference between them is that %0aYesod de Atik is called "No one else but you can see the Creator," for a Zivug on %0aYesod elevates Ohr Hozer and clothes Ohr Yashar with it. This screen is defined %0ain AVI, below Atik, as wings that block the Upper Light. This shows that the %0ascreen possesses a force of restriction, law, judgment. This is why Ohr Hozer is %0aalso called "the Light of Restriction." Thus, Ohr Hozer exists in AVI. %0a%0aConversely, the screen in Yesod de Atik, of which it is said that there "the %0aCreator no longer hides from you" (Yeshayahu, 30:20), while it does raise Ohr %0aHozer, it does not conceal the Creator thereby, does not have the properties of %0awings. This is the reason why it is called Chai Olamim (reviver of worlds). %0a%0aNevertheless, it remains concealed until man attains that level himself, as is %0awritten: "Only your eyes shall see the Creator." There are no wings or anything %0aelse there that conceal Him from outsiders' eyes, for no restrictions are imposed %0aand everything is revealed. And neither are there any restrictions in Ohr Hozer, %0abut only mercy and benevolence, as in Ohr Yashar. %0a%0aThe name Chai Olamim implies that a Zivug is made not on ten Sefirot of %0aOhr Yashar from Above downwards and ten Sefirot of Ohr Hozer from below %0aupwards, and not on the whole of the twenty Sefirot, i.e., not on Malchut herself, %0abut on Yesod de Malchut. In this instance, there are nine Sefirot of Ohr Yashar %0aand nine Sefirot of Ohr Hozer, as Yesod is the ninth Sefira: 9 + 9= 18= 10 + 8 = %0aYod + Chet, which is pronounced in reverse order as Chet-Yod (Chai), for this is %0athe Returning Light. The word "life" (Chaim) is derived from the word "alive" %0a(Chai), for he who is able to make a Zivug on Yesod receives the Upper Light of %0alife, Ohr Hochma. %0a%0aTremendous Upper Light manifests in Atik as a result of this Zivug. This %0ais because all the worlds and all that inhabit them join Nukva, and together %0athey attain true perfection, the level for which they were initially conceived and %0acreated by the Creator. %0a%0aHence, it is said that word flies in the firmament, which signifies the creation %0aof Ohr Hozer from below upwards, which leads to Ohr Yashar descending from %0a%0a%0a%0aWho Is Your Partner? %0a%0a%0a%0a215 %0a%0a%0a%0athe Creator, from Above downwards. And the clothing of Ohr Hozer on Ohr %0aYashar creates a firmament, because the screen that appears in Malchut for the %0acreation of Ohr Hozer comes as a result of the good deeds of the righteous, their %0aMAN (requests for spiritual ascent) aimed at pleasing the Creator. So then, after %0athis screen makes a Zivug with the Upper Light, it becomes a firmament, with %0athe help of which, the righteous attain the full height of the degree on which %0athey have now made a Zivug. %0a%0aThis occurs because when this degree descends to the righteous through the %0afirmament, it clothes in Ohr Hozer (garment of this firmament), which, together %0awith the Ohr Yashar clothed within it, turn over and they descend below the %0ascreen (firmament) and thereby become attainable by the righteous. %0a%0aThose righteous that have achieved such perfection that they can raise %0aMAN to such exalted Zivug have already rid themselves of egoism completely %0aand have no desire to receive anything for themselves. Instead, they raise their %0aMAN (request) with the sole purpose of pleasing the Creator. Therefore, by %0atheir corrections (MAN), they correct the screen in Malchut, and, by creating %0aOhr Hozer in her, which ascends from the screen of Malchut upwards, make her %0acapable of a great Zivug. This is because all that ascends is altruism, bestowal, %0arepelling, and rejecting reception for oneself and egoistic pleasure. %0a%0aThen there is a Zivug with the Upper Light, and the Upper Light clothes %0ain the ascending Returning Light. This descending Upper Light clothes into %0athe Returning Light and enters into the righteous that have raised MAN. The %0aexpression "from below upwards" implies the repelling of Light by a person, and %0a"from Above downwards" designates a person's reception. %0a%0aAnd since the Upper Light comes to man through a firmament, it takes %0athe Light reflected from the firmament as its garment, and one receives the %0aUpper Light clothed in Returning Light. This means that, even after one already %0areceives the spiritual information of the entire degree, he delights in the Upper %0aLight that descends to him only to the extent in which he can please the Creator %0athereby, i.e., to the extent of his strength, the magnitude of his screen, and the %0aamount of Returning Light that clothes the Direct Upper Light. %0a%0aSuch reception of the Upper Light (only to the extent of the magnitude of %0aOhr Hozer created by man) is called the reception for the Creator's sake. And %0awherever one cannot find a way to bestow upon the Creator, he does not receive. %0aHence, his reception is clothed in bestowal: the Upper Direct Light is clothed in %0aReturning Light, meaning the lower one receives only the clothed Upper Light %0afrom the Upper One, i.e., only through the firmament. %0a%0a%0a%0a216 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0a64. And thus, every deed creates firmaments that appear before Atik, and he %0acalls them "new Heavens" or, rather, "renewed firmaments," concealed by %0aSupernal wisdom. And all the other parts of the Torah that are not renewed %0aby means of Supernal wisdom appear before the Creator, ascend and become %0a"the lands of life" (Artzot HaChaim). They then descend and adorn one land. %0aAnd it becomes renewed, and a new land comes into being from all that was %0arenewed in the Torah. %0a%0aThe righteous are constantly raising newer and newer MAN, and thus %0areceive newer and newer degrees of attainments from Atik, with the help of the %0afirmaments created by the Upper Zivug. From these firmaments emerge new %0aHeavens, which are renewed in the degrees of Atik. These exalted attainments %0aof the righteous are therefore called the hidden secrets of Supernal wisdom, for %0athey descend clothed in the garments received from the firmaments. %0a%0aMalchut is called "earth" and Bina is called "the lands of life" (Artzot %0aHaChaim). When Malchut attains all the degrees of Bina, she acquires the name %0a"the land of life." Malchut is also called the "new land," for she exchanges her %0aown properties for those of Bina. And everything that was previously Malchut %0anow becomes Bina. %0a%0aTherefore, it is written that in the future, BON will become SAG, and MA %0awill become AB, for Heaven is ZA that now ascended to the degree of Atik (AB %0aor Hochma). The earth, Nukva de ZA, Malchut, became SAG, Bina. Hence, the %0anew land and the new Heavens are Malchut and ZA that became SAG and AB, %0aAtik and AA. %0a%0a65. It is written, "When the new land and the new Heavens, which I make." %0aIt is not written, "I have made," in past tense, but rather "I make," in present %0atense, for they are constantly made from the renewal and secrets of the Torah. %0aAnd it is written of this: "And I shall place it in your mouth, and in the %0ashadow of your hands' garments, that I may take the Heavens, and lay the %0afoundations of the land" (Yeshayahu, 51:16). It is simply said "Heavens," for %0ait implies the Heavens renewed by the Torah. %0a%0aEverything that is described in the Torah is written in the present tense, %0aas there is no time in the spiritual; everything is written with regard to the one %0a/ho attains the Torah at that given moment. This is what The Zohar wants %0aess here: the matter concerns man's constant work on himself, on his %0a%0athe righteous that have already attained the Upper Light continue cr %0aver and newer Heavens and lands, as is written, "The righteous ascend frc %0a%0a%0a%0aWho Is Your Partner? %0a%0a%0a%0a217 %0a%0a%0a%0a66. Rabbi Elazar said, "What is the meaning of 'in the shadow of your hands' %0agarments?'". He answered, when the Torah was passed to Moshe, tens of %0athousands of Supernal angels appeared so as to raise him with the flames of %0atheir mouths, but the Creator protected him. So now, when the renewal in %0athe Torah ascends and appears before the Creator, He protects it and shelters %0athe one who performed it, so as to prevent the angels from finding out and %0aenvying him, until new Heaven and earth are made out of this renewal in %0athe Torah. Hence, it is said, "To take the Heavens and lay the foundations of %0athe land from the shadow of your hands' garments." It follows that all that is %0aconcealed from the eyes achieves a supernal result. This is why it is said, "In %0athe shadow of your hands' garments." Yet, why should it be concealed from %0athe eyes for the sake of a supernal result? Hence, it is immediately said, "So %0athat I may take the Heavens and lay the foundations of the land." As we have %0alearned— so that new Heavens and earth will appear out of this concealment. %0a%0aThe phrase "In the shadow of your hands' garments" alludes to Ohr Hozer, %0athe garment that stems from the firmament, clothing and covering of the Ohr %0aHochma. Like a shadow, this garment conceals Hochma from outsiders' eyes, so %0athey do not know what is inside. Why are High Degrees concealed from angels? %0aSo they would not envy man, for when the angels, which are made of a very light %0amaterial (without egoism), look at one who is righteous and see his negative %0aproperties, they envy him for the High Degree that he has achieved. They then %0abegin slandering that righteous, the properties that they discover in him. This %0abrings harm to the righteous. %0a%0aTherefore, when a degree clothes into the garment of a firmament (Ohr %0aHozer), this garment measures the degree itself, its magnitude, to prevent man %0afrom receiving more than his intention for the Creator's sake allows, i.e., only %0ato the extent of Ohr Hozer. Thus, he is protected from the angels' envy and from %0atheir ability to harm his spiritual condition, for he becomes equal to them in his %0aproperties: his Returning Light makes him equal. %0a%0aLike everything else that fills the worlds, Melachim (angels) are man's %0ainner properties and forces. In order to avoid harming himself by wishing to %0aattain Higher Degrees before he has acquired Ohr Hozer, these degrees must %0abe concealed. However, in addition to Ohr Hozer, one should exercise caution %0aagainst his desire. %0a%0aThis explains the rule: "The eye sees and the heart covets," and man would %0anot be able to protect his intention, to keep it for the Creator's sake alone, and %0awould desire to receive for himself. However, once clothed in the garment of %0a%0a%0a%0a218 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0athe firmament, he can be certain that he will not receive above his intention to %0areceive for the Creator's sake. %0a%0a%0a%0aexamine how a desire is conceived m man. %0asomething for the first time, not yet knowing what he is going to see. It is as %0aif an object accidentally falls into his field of vision. Naturally, no ban can be %0aimposed on it, as this occurrence is not dependent on man; thus, it is neither %0arewarded nor punished. %0a%0aHowever, when looking at it for the second time— here, man already has free- %0adom of choice. And if the second look is going to result in the desire to receive %0apleasure, it is forbidden. If man cannot restrain himself, and looks for the second %0atime, his eyes send a signal to his heart, and the heart begins to desire. Thus, man %0ahas the power to decide whether or not to allow the desire to be born within hi %0aThis is the meaning of the phrase: "The eye sees and the heart covets." %0a%0a67. He said to these gates and to the words that were set one upon the other in %0athe renewed Torah: "Who are you with? You are my partners. Just as I make %0athe Heavens and the earth with My words, as it is written, 'By the Creator's %0aword were the Heavens made,' so you create new Heavens and earth by your %0alabor in the Torah." %0a%0aThe properties of reception are called "gates," because, like open gates, they %0aare always ready to receive. "Words" are the properties of bestowal, of raising %0aMAN to the Creator. The phrase "Set one upon the other" signifies one clothing %0athe other, and so occurs reception for the sake of bestowal. %0a%0a68. However, if one were to claim that the renovation of the Torah by one %0awho does not even know what he is saying creates a firmament, then look %0aat one who is not familiar with the secrets of the Torah: since he renews the %0aTorah without having sufficient knowledge, all that he renews ascends, and %0athe reverse side of man (male part of the impure force), and the false tongue %0a(from Nukva of the impure force, called Tehom Raba— great abyss) comes %0atoward him. This reversed man skips 500 Parsaot (measures of distance) to %0areceive this renewal of the Torah, takes it and makes a false firmament out of %0ait, called Tohu (abyss). %0a%0aAs we already know, the righteous raise MAN to please the Creator. This %0ais called the "words of the Torah," for the words are renewed as a result of the %0aUpper Zivug, and ZON receive a new Light from this Zivug, to the extent that %0athey come to merit the renewal of Heaven and earth by their actions. They %0athereby become the Creator's partners— fellow workers, for, just like Him, they %0arenew Heaven and earth with their words. %0a%0a%0a%0aWho Is Your Partner? %0a%0a%0a%0a219 %0a%0a%0a%0aAlthough one who is not familiar with the secrets of the Torah (the ways of %0athe Creator) so as to know how to protect himself and to not harm the Higher %0aDegrees tells himself that his intention is for the exalted goal, he deludes himself, %0afor he does not know that which his soul surely knows— that his intentions are %0afor himself. Terrible punishment awaits him, for he allows the impure forces to %0adestroy those who labor in the Torah. The Zohar explains: if one does not know %0athe exact meanings of the words, i.e., if he raises MAN to the great Zivug without %0aa thorough understanding of all the intricate details of the act, the reverse man %0aand the false tongue capture his word. %0a%0aKlipot (one's impure forces) also consist of male and female parts. The male %0apart is called "fruitless return," and the female part is called "falsehood." The %0amale part of the Klipa is not as bad as the female part. And when it is by itself, %0ait does not prompt one to lie by the Creator's name; on the contrary, goodness %0astrikes his eye, yet the eye itself is evil. And he who falls into the hands of the male %0aimpure force uses the Creator's name in vain, for he detaches himself from the %0aCreator and receives no Light from Him, i.e., he utters words and seemingly acts, %0abut fruitlessly, for these actions are not the screen's interaction with the Light. %0a%0aHence, the sages said: "The Creator says of all who is proud: He and I cannot %0abe together" (Talmud, Suta, 5: 1), for his intentions are to receive everything for %0ahimself, for his own benefit, for his pride and vanity, as the sensation of one's %0a"I" is the greatest manifestation of pride. Hence, man falls under the power of %0athe evil eye. Consequently, the MAN that he raises receives no response from %0aAbove, and he utters the Creator's name in vain. Therefore, the male part of the %0aimpure force is called empty, fruitless, false, vain, unsuccessful, and futile, for %0athe Creator cannot unite with him due to the dissimilarity of their properties. %0a%0aIf, however, one feels not his similarity to the Creator, but rather his %0aoppositeness in properties from Him, and perceives himself as the most evil of %0aall, he can then lower himself before the Creator, suppress all of his properties %0aout of hatred for them, and the Creator Himself will perform the remaining part %0aof his correction. However, one who is proud not only fails to understand the %0aextent of his remoteness from the Creator, he actually believes that he is entitled %0ato receive more than others, and that the Creator owes him something. %0a%0aNukva de Klipa is called "falsehood." After one falls into the net of the male %0apart of the impure force, the latter makes a Zivug with its Nukva (impure, bitter, %0aand evil force), which, as a result of its connection to the male part, falsifies the %0aCreator's name, descends and instigates man, and then ascends, complaints %0a%0a%0a%0a220 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aagainst him, and takes his soul. However holy this soul was, Nukva de Klipa grabs %0aall of it for itself. %0a%0aNaturally, this refers to one who works on himself and advances spiritually, %0afor whom working for the Creator's sake is his life's calling. Yet, he may %0aoccasionally fail to observe precisely all the restrictions, and thus find himself %0ain such states. An ordinary person, however, who neither works on himself %0anor studies Kabbalah, is obviously entirely unrelated to either pure or impure %0aspiritual forces. %0a%0aFor example, the male impure force says that one must study the Torah, but %0athen steals the results of his work for itself. As a result, man loses interest in his %0astudies, and must once more consolidate himself in his efforts and advancement. %0aAnd although he attains the Creator and the revelation of Light to a certain %0adegree, it is nonetheless fruitless, for all of his attainments vanish from him, and %0ahe gains nothing from them. %0a%0aTherefore, the Torah refers to it as the "reverse man," for initially he ate %0aand drank and said "Go," i.e., raise MAN to the Creator and receive the Light %0afor the sake of the exalted goal, but not for yourself. Thus, it pretends that it %0ais not the impure force, but its opposite. However, due to its property called %0a"fruitless return," it then makes a Zivug with its Nukva (the great abyss), which %0asteals man's soul and destroys him with its falsehood, and man is left without %0aeven the slightest part of his soul that is holy and pure! %0a%0aHence, it is written that he skips through 500 Parsaot: initially, ZON of %0athe impure forces have only VAfC in ZA and a point in Malchut. Consequently, %0athey can only be equal to ZON de Atzilut in their Katnut (small state), when %0athey are also VAK and a point, and have neither the power nor the place to %0aconnect to Bina. %0a%0aNevertheless, thanks to the MAN raised by the lower ones, the male impure %0aforce is given the opportunity to skip through ZAT de Bina, which sustain the pure %0aand holy ZON. ZON contain Sefirot HGT NH (Netzah-Hod) = 5x 100 = 500, since %0aa Sefira in Bina equals 100. And this occurs thanks to the MAN raised by one who %0ais uncertain of his intentions (whether or not he acts for the Creator's sake). %0a%0aThe "reverse man" then makes a Zivug with his Nukva on this false MAN, %0aand receives the Upper Light for the construction of his Partzuf, much like the %0aspiritually pure Heavens that were created on the pure MAN. Also, the new %0aHeavens created on the impure MAN are called "reverse," "empty." And since the %0aimpure Malchut took part in this, these Heavens are called Tohu (abyss/ chaos). %0a%0a%0a%0aWho Is Your Partner? %0a%0a%0a%0a221 %0a%0a%0a%0a69. And this reverse man then flies across the empty firmament, traversing %0a6,000 Parsaot in one bound. And as soon as this empty firmament stops, %0aan impure woman emerges at once, seizes onto this empty firmament, and %0apartakes in it. She leaves it and slays hundreds of thousands, for as long as she %0aremains in this firmament, she has the authority and power to fly and traverse %0athe whole world in an instant. %0a%0aAll that stems from the empty firmament stems from the impure force, which %0ais correspondingly opposite the Supernal, holy wisdom of Ohr Hochma. The %0aSefira Hochma equals 1,000, and so it is written that it flies across the firmament %0ain 6,000 = six Sefirot HGT NHY of Partzuf Hochma, each of which equals 1,000. %0a%0aAfter the new heavens of the impure male part, called the "empty heavens," %0awere completed, the power of its female half, Nulcva ("the great abyss"), was %0arevealed. Her force attacked the firmament with falsehood by the Creator's %0aname; she soared through the sky, and the heavens were then called Tohu. %0a%0aSince Nukva of the impure forces partakes in this firmament, she becomes %0astronger and grows even more than the male level of the impure part. This is %0abecause the male impure part reaches up to VAK of Hochma, which equals 6,000 %0aParsaot, whereas Nukva grows to the full ten Sefirot, i.e., the entire world. %0a%0aTherefore, she is immensely powerful and can destroy many, for, as Rashi %0asays, "The Creator created one opposite the other." And just as new, Holy %0aHeavens and lands are created thanks to the MAN raised by the righteous, new, %0aimpure heavens and lands are created through the MAN raised by those who do %0anot know exactly how one should work for the Creator. %0a%0a70. It is written of it: "Do not facilitate fruitless transgression." Transgression %0ais related to the male part, and is as heavy as wagon shafts. What is this %0atransgression? It is the impure Nukva. With reins she draws the male impure %0apart to fruitlessness. And then, as a result, a transgression is committed, as %0athe male part draws itself towards this Nukva, who grows strong and flies off %0ato slay people. And many does she slay. And who is it that caused all this? It %0ais those that study the Torah, but do not attain Ohrah and Morah (Light and %0abestowal). May the Creator be merciful to them! %0a%0aAs was already mentioned above, the male impure part is not as evil as the %0afemale part. This is so because it makes itself similar to the holy part of the %0acreature; hence, it is called fruitless. However, due to this similarity, it has great %0apower to ensnare man, as, for example, just as the sages do, it encourages people %0ato study the Torah. Yet, its goals are different from that of the Creator; it wants %0ato receive wisdom (Hochma), and not to become altruistic. %0a%0a%0a%0a222 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aAnd after one is caught in its toils, the male impure force makes a Zivug %0awith its impure Nukva, and, like heavy wagon shafts, they pull man into an abyss %0aso great and dark that he doesn't even realize that he is in darkness. On the %0acontrary, he considers himself wise and righteous. The male part only catches %0aman, binds him, and then brings him to the impure Nukva and casts him at her %0afeet. Only then does he falter, falls into the great abyss and perishes. %0a%0a71. Rabbi Shimon said to his friends: "I beg of you not to utter any discernments %0afrom the Torah, no matter what you may hear from the Great Tree of Truth, %0aso that you would not assist the impure Nukva in slaying multitudes of people %0afor naught." They all opened and mouthed: "Save us, O Merciful One! Save %0aus, O Merciful One!" %0a%0aRabbi Shimon said that if you have attained the discernment yourselves, %0athen you are allowed, but if not, you must listen to the Great Tree (the great %0alearned sage, whose wisdom and purity can be trusted) to learn how to work %0afor the Creator. %0a%0a72. Come and see, the Creator created the world by the Torah. And He looked %0ainto the Torah not once, not twice, not thrice, and not four times. Only after %0athat did He create the world. This should show people how not to err. %0a%0a73. Opposite these four times, the Creator saw, counted, prepared, and %0ainvestigated what He had created. It is therefore written, "Beresheet (In %0athe beginning) Barah (created) Elokim (the Creator) Et (the)"— four words, %0acorresponding to the four above. And then, it is written: "Heaven"— opposite %0aall four words, for the Creator looked into the Torah before He began to %0amanifest His thought into reality. %0a%0aThe four words signify four time periods or four Sefirot H-B-ZA-M. "Saw" %0adesignates Hochma, "counted"— Bina, "prepared"— ZA, and "investigated"— %0aMalchut. After these four, the Creator created what He created. %0a%0aWe find the same in the Torah: Beresheet is Hochma, Barah is Bina, Elokim is %0aZA, and Et (the) is Malchut, which includes everything from Aleph to Tav— all the %0aletters and all the properties. Hence, she is designated in the Torah by the word %0aEt = Aleph-Tav (from the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet, Aleph, to the last, %0aTav). And after these four, He created the Heavens and the earth, i.e., revealed %0athe next, lower degree, below Malchut.

How %0a%3c much effort should man exert in the Torah day and night, for the Creator is %0a%3c attentive to those who study it. And with every word that man attains by his %0a%3c efforts in the Torah, he builds a firmament." %0a%3c %0a%3c The Creator gave the righteous the power of His speech. And just as the %0a%3c Creator creates the creature by the power of His word, so the righteous create %0a%3c new Heavens by its power. This is why Rabbi Shimon opened his speech by %0a%3c explaining the words, "In the beginning, the Creator created Heaven and %0a%3c earth," as the word Barah (created) also means "closing" and "limiting." And %0a%3c we must understand why the Creator had created it in such a closed form. %0a%3c He answers, "To put the correction of Heaven and earth in the words of %0a%3c the righteous, to make them His partners— participants in the creation of %0a%3c Heaven and earth." %0a%3c %0a%3c There are two kinds of renewal of Heaven and earth that the Creator %0a%3c enclosed in the mouths of the righteous: %0a%3c %0a%3c 1. The correction of Adam's sin, the correction of the past. Even before %0a%3c the creation of Adam, the Creator had made a secret correction of Heaven and %0a%3c earth, as it is described in the beginning of the Torah, in the chapter Beresheet: %0a%3c ZON de Atzilut ascended to AVI and to AA, while Adam ascended to ZON %0a%3c and YESHSUT. As a result, Adam received the Light of NRN de Atzilut, for he %0a%3c clothed YESHSUT and ZON de Atzilut, i.e., ascended to their level. %0a%3c %0a%3c Adam is located within the worlds BYA and he ascends together with these %0a%3c worlds. All the worlds can ascend above their permanent state or descend to %0a%3c their places with Adam inside of them. Adam's spiritual level and the Light that %0a%3c he receives are determined by his location (see page 212). %0a%3c %0a%3c 209 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 210 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c DURING ASCENT %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c PERMANENT STATE %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Atik %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c AVI %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c AA %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ZON %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c AVI %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Adam - Beria %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c YESHSUT + ZON %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Parsa of the world of Atzilut %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Adam - Yetzira %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Beria %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Adam - Assiya %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Yetzira %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Assiya %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c In other sources, such as the Talmud {Bava Batra, 58:2), this is described %0a%3c as Adam's ascent to the level of the sun (ZA de Atzilut). This Light is called %0a%3c "Zihara Ilaa" (Zihara is the Aramaic word for Zohar in Hebrew or "radiant %0a%3c Light" in English). %0a%3c %0a%3c As a result of his sin, Adam fell spiritually to the level of our corporeal world %0a%3c (Talmud, Hagigah, 12:1). And instead of NRN de Atzilut that he used to receive %0a%3c before his fall, he now receives the Light from the worlds BYA that are below %0a%3c Parsa. And as a result of Adam's sin, Heaven (ZA) and earth (Malchut) of the %0a%3c world of Atzilut descended to the level of VAK de ZA and the point of Malchut %0a%3c respectively, as they descended below Tahur de Partzuf AA. %0a%3c %0a%3c And the righteous that live in this world, but already exist spiritually in %0a%3c the spiritual worlds of BYA, are entrusted with the task of correcting all that %0a%3c transpired through Adam's fault, and to return, to renew the Heavens and the %0a%3c earth (ZON de Atzilut) and elevate them to AVI and AA— ZA to AA and Malchut %0a%3c to AVI, as it was before the sin. And as a result of their work, the righteous will %0a%3c receive the Light of the world of Atzilut that the corrected Adam is entitled to, %0a%3c for they (their souls, spiritual Kelim or inner spiritual Partzuf) are his parts. %0a%3c %0a%3c 2. However, even before the sin, Adam was not in the perfect state for which %0a%3c the Creator had created him. Hence, after the righteous correct the consequences %0a%3c of Adam's sin and attain NRN de Atzilut, which existed in Adam before the sin, %0a%3c new work awaits them— to receive new Upper Light that has yet to descend. In %0a%3c other words, if the first goal is to correct the sin, the second is to attain even %0a%3c more. It is called to "create new Heaven and earth," new properties of ZON, in %0a%3c which new, Higher Light can be received. %0a%3c %0a%3c This new level or degree that has never been present in any Kli is described %0a%3c as "neither hath an eye seen the Creator beside thee," and the degrees which %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Who Is Your Partner? %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 211 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c the righteous attach to the worlds are called "new Heaven" and "new earth," for %0a%3c they are truly new and have never before existed in reality. %0a%3c %0a%3c And this Heaven and earth, which the righteous correct to the level that %0a%3c preceded Adam's sin, during the creation (Beresheet), are not called new, as they've %0a%3c already existed and the Creator Himself corrected them even before Adam's sin. %0a%3c Hence, they are called renewed, and the righteous who correct them are not %0a%3c called the Creator's partners. %0a%3c %0a%3c "Encloses in their mouths" implies reception of such Upper Light that was %0a%3c neither received by Adam nor emanated from the Creator. And now, by the %0a%3c actions of the righteous, which are called partners, participants and co-creators, %0a%3c it comes out and shines in creation. Thus we see that all the righteous are %0a%3c divided into two groups: those who correct Adam's sin and those who create %0a%3c new degrees of attainment. The latter are called the Creator's partners. %0a%3c %0a%3c ZA is called voice and Malchut is called speech. When a righteous person %0a%3c studies the Torah and thereby raises MAN (by the voice and speech of his To rah) %0a%3c from his soul to ZON, his voice ascends to ZA and his speech ascends to Malchut. %0a%3c The voice of the Torah that ascends with MAN to ZA is called the Creator %0a%3c (Kadosh Baruch Hu). %0a%3c %0a%3c Also, each renewed word in the Torah builds a new firmament. A word %0a%3c means speech, and any speech that renews the Torah by those who study it %0a%3c ascends in the form of MAN to Malchut, who is called "word and speech." This %0a%3c creates a new firmament in the form of a screen, on which a Zivug between the %0a%3c Creator and the Shechina is made. This is what the righteous, who study the %0a%3c Torah, attain by raising MAN! %0a%3c %0a%3c However, renewal in the words of the Torah does not imply anything new %0a%3c in the voice of the Torah. For Malchut has to recreate herself for each new Zivug, %0a%3c for after each Zivug, Malchut returns to the state of virginity thanks to the MAN %0a%3c raised by the righteous, who constantly renew her properties, her Yesod— the %0a%3c Kli for the reception of Light from ZA. Hence, it is written that the Torah is %0a%3c renewed by each word, for a word (Malchut) is renewed by the speech of the %0a%3c righteous in the Torah, as, after each Zivug, the previous Kli disappears and a %0a%3c new one appears. %0a%3c %0a%3c 62. We have learned that just as the Torah is renewed by one's mouth, that %0a%3c renewal ascends and appears before the Creator. And the Creator accepts this %0a%3c wisdom, kisses it, and adorns it with seventy adornments. And the renewed %0a%3c wisdom itself ascends and settles on the head of the righteous that revive the %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 212 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c worlds, and then flies, soaring through 70,000 worlds, until it ascends to Atik, %0a%3c the Sefira Keter. And all that exists in Atik is concealed, Supernal wisdom. %0a%3c %0a%3c When a person raises MAN from his Torah, this word, which is Nukva de %0a%3c ZA, ascends and connects to the Creator in a Zivug with Him. The Creator takes %0a%3c this word, kisses, and adorns it, and these are the two types of Zivugim (plural %0a%3c for Zivug) in ZON: %0a%3c %0a%3c 1. Zivug de Neshikin (kisses); %0a%3c %0a%3c 2. Zivug de Yesodot (bases/ foundations). %0a%3c %0a%3c Each Zivug consists of two Zivugim, for a Zivug on Ohr Hochma must clothe %0a%3c itself into the Partzuf (garment) of Ohr Hassadim. Therefore, a preliminary Zivug %0a%3c must be made on Ohr Hassadim, whose role is to become a garment for Ohr %0a%3c Hochma. This is why each Zivug consists of two Zivugim: %0a%3c %0a%3c 1. Zivug on the degree of Hochma, called Zivug de Neshikin, because it %0a%3c stands at the Peh de Rosh of the Partzuf, at the level of Rosh and GAR. %0a%3c %0a%3c 2. Zivug on the degree of Hassadim, called Zivug de Yesodot, because it %0a%3c takes place at the level of the bodies of the Partzufim. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, it is said that the Creator took Nukva in this word and kissed her, %0a%3c i.e., made a Zivug de Neshikin at the level of GAR, and then adorned her, i.e., %0a%3c made a Zivug de Yesodot at the level of Hassadim. As a result, Ohr Hochma clothed %0a%3c in Ohr Hassadim, and Nukva received the complete Light. %0a%3c %0a%3c IN SEVENTY ADORNMENTS: the complete Light of Nuba is called %0a%3c "seventy adornments," because Malchut is the seventh day, and when she receives %0a%3c from ZA, her Sefirot become tens, just as the Sefirot of ZA; this turns Malchut into %0a%3c 7 x 10 = 70. Mochin (wisdom), Ohr Hochma is called Atara (adornment or crown). %0a%3c Hence, what she receives is called "seventy adornments." After Malchut receives %0a%3c the Light of Hassadim, with the help of the MAN of the righteous, she becomes %0a%3c fit to receive the Upper Light of Hochma, the seventy adornments. %0a%3c %0a%3c As was said above, there are two kinds of renewal of Heaven and earth (ZON): %0a%3c %0a%3c 1. When everything returns to the state preceding Adam's sin. In that %0a%3c instance, Malchut is called the "word of the Torah" ( VAK), where the %0a%3c Torah is ZA. %0a%3c %0a%3c 2. When Heaven and earth are created with a new Light, which even Adam %0a%3c did not attain prior to his sin. And this attainable word is called GAR. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is written (Talmud, Berachot, 7:1) that the righteous sit with adornments %0a%3c on their heads, for Malchut ascended to adorn the head of the righteous (ZA) %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Who Is Your Partner? %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 213 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c in his Yesod, called Chai Qlamim (reviver of worlds), or, rather, in his Ateret %0a%3c Yesod-the place of circumcision. And this transpires thanks to the MAN raised %0a%3c by the righteous that have already attained the Upper Light of Adam's Zihara %0a%3c llaa, just as Rabbi Shimon and his friends have already attained it. %0a%3c %0a%3c Ohr Hochma is called Ohr Haya. Since ZA desires only Hassadim, he can %0a%3c receive Ohr Haya only with the help of his Nukva, Malchut. It turns out that %0a%3c ZA lives, i.e., receives Ohr Haya, only if he is in a Zivug with Nukva, called Olam %0a%3c (world). That is how the name Chai Olamim (reviver of worlds) originated. %0a%3c %0a%3c Also, Nukva, the adornment on his head, becomes important (Keter - crown) %0a%3c because ZA receives this Light only thanks to his Malchut. Although Malchut was %0a%3c born from ZA, since it is Malchut and no other that evokes, makes reception of %0a%3c the Light of Life possible, ZA calls her his mother. Indeed, ZA receives Ohr Ha^a %0a%3c (the Light of Life) from her. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, it is written that Malchut flies and soars in 70,000 worlds, and %0a%3c after her Zivug with ZA on his Atara (adornment on his head), she ascends even %0a%3c higher, to AA, where the seven Sefirot of Malchut, called 70,000 worlds, become %0a%3c corrected, as one Sefira of ZA equals 10,000. After that, Malchut ascends higher %0a%3c still— to Atik. And all of these ascents of ZON to Atilc transpire thanks to the %0a%3c efforts made by the righteous that raise MAN: a Zivug on Atara elevates ZON to %0a%3c AVI, from which they ascend to AA (70,000 worlds), and from there to Atik, the %0a%3c highest possible point of ascent. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is therefore written that all the words of Atik 's Supernal wisdom are locked, %0a%3c since Malchut receives the Upper Light upon ascending to Atik, and each degree %0a%3c that she receives from Atik is called "concealed," "Supernal wisdom," i.e., GAR %0a%3c de Hochma. This is because words of wisdom signify the degree of Hochma, and %0a%3c the words "concealed," "secret," and "Supernal" refer to GAR. Also, they are %0a%3c revealed only to those who attain the level of Atik, but not below, as Tzimtzum %0a%3c Bet (the second restriction) already exists in AA. %0a%3c %0a%3c 63. And when this hidden wisdom, which is renewed here in this world, %0a%3c ascends, she joins Atik, ascends and descends, enters 18 worlds, where no %0a%3c eye has seen the Creator besides you. They emerge from there and appear %0a%3c before Atik, complete and perfect. Meanwhile, Atik tests her and finds her %0a%3c most desirable above all else. He then takes her and adorns her with 370,000 %0a%3c adornments. And she, the renewed Torah, ascends and descends, and is %0a%3c transformed into a firmament. %0a%3c %0a%3c During the ascent of Malchut to Atik, she joins the Zivug that transpires %0a%3c there, and creates Ohr Hoxer (Returning Light) by accepting Ohr Yashar (Direct %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 214 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Light) at the level of Atik's properties. The ascent of Malchut means that Malchut %0a%3c elevates Ohr Hozer from herself upwards. Malchut's descent means that she sends %0a%3c Ohr Yashar from Above downwards. And then Malchut receives the hidden, %0a%3c secret, and Supernal wisdom. The word "joins" signifies her contact with the %0a%3c Ohr Hozer and the Ohr Yashar within Atik itself. %0a%3c %0a%3c This Zivug is made in Atik on its Yesod, but not on Malchut, since Malchut de %0a%3c Atik is concealed until the end of correction. Like Yesod de ZA during its ascent %0a%3c to AVI, this Yesod is called Chai Olamim. The difference between them is that %0a%3c Yesod de Atik is called "No one else but you can see the Creator," for a Zivug on %0a%3c Yesod elevates Ohr Hozer and clothes Ohr Yashar with it. This screen is defined %0a%3c in AVI, below Atik, as wings that block the Upper Light. This shows that the %0a%3c screen possesses a force of restriction, law, judgment. This is why Ohr Hozer is %0a%3c also called "the Light of Restriction." Thus, Ohr Hozer exists in AVI. %0a%3c %0a%3c Conversely, the screen in Yesod de Atik, of which it is said that there "the %0a%3c Creator no longer hides from you" (Yeshayahu, 30:20), while it does raise Ohr %0a%3c Hozer, it does not conceal the Creator thereby, does not have the properties of %0a%3c wings. This is the reason why it is called Chai Olamim (reviver of worlds). %0a%3c %0a%3c Nevertheless, it remains concealed until man attains that level himself, as is %0a%3c written: "Only your eyes shall see the Creator." There are no wings or anything %0a%3c else there that conceal Him from outsiders' eyes, for no restrictions are imposed %0a%3c and everything is revealed. And neither are there any restrictions in Ohr Hozer, %0a%3c but only mercy and benevolence, as in Ohr Yashar. %0a%3c %0a%3c The name Chai Olamim implies that a Zivug is made not on ten Sefirot of %0a%3c Ohr Yashar from Above downwards and ten Sefirot of Ohr Hozer from below %0a%3c upwards, and not on the whole of the twenty Sefirot, i.e., not on Malchut herself, %0a%3c but on Yesod de Malchut. In this instance, there are nine Sefirot of Ohr Yashar %0a%3c and nine Sefirot of Ohr Hozer, as Yesod is the ninth Sefira: 9 + 9= 18= 10 + 8 = %0a%3c Yod + Chet, which is pronounced in reverse order as Chet-Yod (Chai), for this is %0a%3c the Returning Light. The word "life" (Chaim) is derived from the word "alive" %0a%3c (Chai), for he who is able to make a Zivug on Yesod receives the Upper Light of %0a%3c life, Ohr Hochma. %0a%3c %0a%3c Tremendous Upper Light manifests in Atik as a result of this Zivug. This %0a%3c is because all the worlds and all that inhabit them join Nukva, and together %0a%3c they attain true perfection, the level for which they were initially conceived and %0a%3c created by the Creator. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, it is said that word flies in the firmament, which signifies the creation %0a%3c of Ohr Hozer from below upwards, which leads to Ohr Yashar descending from %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Who Is Your Partner? %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 215 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c the Creator, from Above downwards. And the clothing of Ohr Hozer on Ohr %0a%3c Yashar creates a firmament, because the screen that appears in Malchut for the %0a%3c creation of Ohr Hozer comes as a result of the good deeds of the righteous, their %0a%3c MAN (requests for spiritual ascent) aimed at pleasing the Creator. So then, after %0a%3c this screen makes a Zivug with the Upper Light, it becomes a firmament, with %0a%3c the help of which, the righteous attain the full height of the degree on which %0a%3c they have now made a Zivug. %0a%3c %0a%3c This occurs because when this degree descends to the righteous through the %0a%3c firmament, it clothes in Ohr Hozer (garment of this firmament), which, together %0a%3c with the Ohr Yashar clothed within it, turn over and they descend below the %0a%3c screen (firmament) and thereby become attainable by the righteous. %0a%3c %0a%3c Those righteous that have achieved such perfection that they can raise %0a%3c MAN to such exalted Zivug have already rid themselves of egoism completely %0a%3c and have no desire to receive anything for themselves. Instead, they raise their %0a%3c MAN (request) with the sole purpose of pleasing the Creator. Therefore, by %0a%3c their corrections (MAN), they correct the screen in Malchut, and, by creating %0a%3c Ohr Hozer in her, which ascends from the screen of Malchut upwards, make her %0a%3c capable of a great Zivug. This is because all that ascends is altruism, bestowal, %0a%3c repelling, and rejecting reception for oneself and egoistic pleasure. %0a%3c %0a%3c Then there is a Zivug with the Upper Light, and the Upper Light clothes %0a%3c in the ascending Returning Light. This descending Upper Light clothes into %0a%3c the Returning Light and enters into the righteous that have raised MAN. The %0a%3c expression "from below upwards" implies the repelling of Light by a person, and %0a%3c "from Above downwards" designates a person's reception. %0a%3c %0a%3c And since the Upper Light comes to man through a firmament, it takes %0a%3c the Light reflected from the firmament as its garment, and one receives the %0a%3c Upper Light clothed in Returning Light. This means that, even after one already %0a%3c receives the spiritual information of the entire degree, he delights in the Upper %0a%3c Light that descends to him only to the extent in which he can please the Creator %0a%3c thereby, i.e., to the extent of his strength, the magnitude of his screen, and the %0a%3c amount of Returning Light that clothes the Direct Upper Light. %0a%3c %0a%3c Such reception of the Upper Light (only to the extent of the magnitude of %0a%3c Ohr Hozer created by man) is called the reception for the Creator's sake. And %0a%3c wherever one cannot find a way to bestow upon the Creator, he does not receive. %0a%3c Hence, his reception is clothed in bestowal: the Upper Direct Light is clothed in %0a%3c Returning Light, meaning the lower one receives only the clothed Upper Light %0a%3c from the Upper One, i.e., only through the firmament. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 216 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 64. And thus, every deed creates firmaments that appear before Atik, and he %0a%3c calls them "new Heavens" or, rather, "renewed firmaments," concealed by %0a%3c Supernal wisdom. And all the other parts of the Torah that are not renewed %0a%3c by means of Supernal wisdom appear before the Creator, ascend and become %0a%3c "the lands of life" (Artzot HaChaim). They then descend and adorn one land. %0a%3c And it becomes renewed, and a new land comes into being from all that was %0a%3c renewed in the Torah. %0a%3c %0a%3c The righteous are constantly raising newer and newer MAN, and thus %0a%3c receive newer and newer degrees of attainments from Atik, with the help of the %0a%3c firmaments created by the Upper Zivug. From these firmaments emerge new %0a%3c Heavens, which are renewed in the degrees of Atik. These exalted attainments %0a%3c of the righteous are therefore called the hidden secrets of Supernal wisdom, for %0a%3c they descend clothed in the garments received from the firmaments. %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut is called "earth" and Bina is called "the lands of life" (Artzot %0a%3c HaChaim). When Malchut attains all the degrees of Bina, she acquires the name %0a%3c "the land of life." Malchut is also called the "new land," for she exchanges her %0a%3c own properties for those of Bina. And everything that was previously Malchut %0a%3c now becomes Bina. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, it is written that in the future, BON will become SAG, and MA %0a%3c will become AB, for Heaven is ZA that now ascended to the degree of Atik (AB %0a%3c or Hochma). The earth, Nukva de ZA, Malchut, became SAG, Bina. Hence, the %0a%3c new land and the new Heavens are Malchut and ZA that became SAG and AB, %0a%3c Atik and AA. %0a%3c %0a%3c 65. It is written, "When the new land and the new Heavens, which I make." %0a%3c It is not written, "I have made," in past tense, but rather "I make," in present %0a%3c tense, for they are constantly made from the renewal and secrets of the Torah. %0a%3c And it is written of this: "And I shall place it in your mouth, and in the %0a%3c shadow of your hands' garments, that I may take the Heavens, and lay the %0a%3c foundations of the land" (Yeshayahu, 51:16). It is simply said "Heavens," for %0a%3c it implies the Heavens renewed by the Torah. %0a%3c %0a%3c Everything that is described in the Torah is written in the present tense, %0a%3c as there is no time in the spiritual; everything is written with regard to the one %0a%3c /ho attains the Torah at that given moment. This is what The Zohar wants %0a%3c ess here: the matter concerns man's constant work on himself, on his %0a%3c %0a%3c the righteous that have already attained the Upper Light continue cr %0a%3c ver and newer Heavens and lands, as is written, "The righteous ascend frc %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Who Is Your Partner? %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 217 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 66. Rabbi Elazar said, "What is the meaning of 'in the shadow of your hands' %0a%3c garments?'". He answered, when the Torah was passed to Moshe, tens of %0a%3c thousands of Supernal angels appeared so as to raise him with the flames of %0a%3c their mouths, but the Creator protected him. So now, when the renewal in %0a%3c the Torah ascends and appears before the Creator, He protects it and shelters %0a%3c the one who performed it, so as to prevent the angels from finding out and %0a%3c envying him, until new Heaven and earth are made out of this renewal in %0a%3c the Torah. Hence, it is said, "To take the Heavens and lay the foundations of %0a%3c the land from the shadow of your hands' garments." It follows that all that is %0a%3c concealed from the eyes achieves a supernal result. This is why it is said, "In %0a%3c the shadow of your hands' garments." Yet, why should it be concealed from %0a%3c the eyes for the sake of a supernal result? Hence, it is immediately said, "So %0a%3c that I may take the Heavens and lay the foundations of the land." As we have %0a%3c learned— so that new Heavens and earth will appear out of this concealment. %0a%3c %0a%3c The phrase "In the shadow of your hands' garments" alludes to Ohr Hozer, %0a%3c the garment that stems from the firmament, clothing and covering of the Ohr %0a%3c Hochma. Like a shadow, this garment conceals Hochma from outsiders' eyes, so %0a%3c they do not know what is inside. Why are High Degrees concealed from angels? %0a%3c So they would not envy man, for when the angels, which are made of a very light %0a%3c material (without egoism), look at one who is righteous and see his negative %0a%3c properties, they envy him for the High Degree that he has achieved. They then %0a%3c begin slandering that righteous, the properties that they discover in him. This %0a%3c brings harm to the righteous. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, when a degree clothes into the garment of a firmament (Ohr %0a%3c Hozer), this garment measures the degree itself, its magnitude, to prevent man %0a%3c from receiving more than his intention for the Creator's sake allows, i.e., only %0a%3c to the extent of Ohr Hozer. Thus, he is protected from the angels' envy and from %0a%3c their ability to harm his spiritual condition, for he becomes equal to them in his %0a%3c properties: his Returning Light makes him equal. %0a%3c %0a%3c Like everything else that fills the worlds, Melachim (angels) are man's %0a%3c inner properties and forces. In order to avoid harming himself by wishing to %0a%3c attain Higher Degrees before he has acquired Ohr Hozer, these degrees must %0a%3c be concealed. However, in addition to Ohr Hozer, one should exercise caution %0a%3c against his desire. %0a%3c %0a%3c This explains the rule: "The eye sees and the heart covets," and man would %0a%3c not be able to protect his intention, to keep it for the Creator's sake alone, and %0a%3c would desire to receive for himself. However, once clothed in the garment of %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 218 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c the firmament, he can be certain that he will not receive above his intention to %0a%3c receive for the Creator's sake. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c examine how a desire is conceived m man. %0a%3c something for the first time, not yet knowing what he is going to see. It is as %0a%3c if an object accidentally falls into his field of vision. Naturally, no ban can be %0a%3c imposed on it, as this occurrence is not dependent on man; thus, it is neither %0a%3c rewarded nor punished. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, when looking at it for the second time— here, man already has free- %0a%3c dom of choice. And if the second look is going to result in the desire to receive %0a%3c pleasure, it is forbidden. If man cannot restrain himself, and looks for the second %0a%3c time, his eyes send a signal to his heart, and the heart begins to desire. Thus, man %0a%3c has the power to decide whether or not to allow the desire to be born within hi %0a%3c This is the meaning of the phrase: "The eye sees and the heart covets." %0a%3c %0a%3c 67. He said to these gates and to the words that were set one upon the other in %0a%3c the renewed Torah: "Who are you with? You are my partners. Just as I make %0a%3c the Heavens and the earth with My words, as it is written, 'By the Creator's %0a%3c word were the Heavens made,' so you create new Heavens and earth by your %0a%3c labor in the Torah." %0a%3c %0a%3c The properties of reception are called "gates," because, like open gates, they %0a%3c are always ready to receive. "Words" are the properties of bestowal, of raising %0a%3c MAN to the Creator. The phrase "Set one upon the other" signifies one clothing %0a%3c the other, and so occurs reception for the sake of bestowal. %0a%3c %0a%3c 68. However, if one were to claim that the renovation of the Torah by one %0a%3c who does not even know what he is saying creates a firmament, then look %0a%3c at one who is not familiar with the secrets of the Torah: since he renews the %0a%3c Torah without having sufficient knowledge, all that he renews ascends, and %0a%3c the reverse side of man (male part of the impure force), and the false tongue %0a%3c (from Nukva of the impure force, called Tehom Raba— great abyss) comes %0a%3c toward him. This reversed man skips 500 Parsaot (measures of distance) to %0a%3c receive this renewal of the Torah, takes it and makes a false firmament out of %0a%3c it, called Tohu (abyss). %0a%3c %0a%3c As we already know, the righteous raise MAN to please the Creator. This %0a%3c is called the "words of the Torah," for the words are renewed as a result of the %0a%3c Upper Zivug, and ZON receive a new Light from this Zivug, to the extent that %0a%3c they come to merit the renewal of Heaven and earth by their actions. They %0a%3c thereby become the Creator's partners— fellow workers, for, just like Him, they %0a%3c renew Heaven and earth with their words. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Who Is Your Partner? %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 219 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Although one who is not familiar with the secrets of the Torah (the ways of %0a%3c the Creator) so as to know how to protect himself and to not harm the Higher %0a%3c Degrees tells himself that his intention is for the exalted goal, he deludes himself, %0a%3c for he does not know that which his soul surely knows— that his intentions are %0a%3c for himself. Terrible punishment awaits him, for he allows the impure forces to %0a%3c destroy those who labor in the Torah. The Zohar explains: if one does not know %0a%3c the exact meanings of the words, i.e., if he raises MAN to the great Zivug without %0a%3c a thorough understanding of all the intricate details of the act, the reverse man %0a%3c and the false tongue capture his word. %0a%3c %0a%3c Klipot (one's impure forces) also consist of male and female parts. The male %0a%3c part is called "fruitless return," and the female part is called "falsehood." The %0a%3c male part of the Klipa is not as bad as the female part. And when it is by itself, %0a%3c it does not prompt one to lie by the Creator's name; on the contrary, goodness %0a%3c strikes his eye, yet the eye itself is evil. And he who falls into the hands of the male %0a%3c impure force uses the Creator's name in vain, for he detaches himself from the %0a%3c Creator and receives no Light from Him, i.e., he utters words and seemingly acts, %0a%3c but fruitlessly, for these actions are not the screen's interaction with the Light. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, the sages said: "The Creator says of all who is proud: He and I cannot %0a%3c be together" (Talmud, Suta, 5: 1), for his intentions are to receive everything for %0a%3c himself, for his own benefit, for his pride and vanity, as the sensation of one's %0a%3c "I" is the greatest manifestation of pride. Hence, man falls under the power of %0a%3c the evil eye. Consequently, the MAN that he raises receives no response from %0a%3c Above, and he utters the Creator's name in vain. Therefore, the male part of the %0a%3c impure force is called empty, fruitless, false, vain, unsuccessful, and futile, for %0a%3c the Creator cannot unite with him due to the dissimilarity of their properties. %0a%3c %0a%3c If, however, one feels not his similarity to the Creator, but rather his %0a%3c oppositeness in properties from Him, and perceives himself as the most evil of %0a%3c all, he can then lower himself before the Creator, suppress all of his properties %0a%3c out of hatred for them, and the Creator Himself will perform the remaining part %0a%3c of his correction. However, one who is proud not only fails to understand the %0a%3c extent of his remoteness from the Creator, he actually believes that he is entitled %0a%3c to receive more than others, and that the Creator owes him something. %0a%3c %0a%3c Nukva de Klipa is called "falsehood." After one falls into the net of the male %0a%3c part of the impure force, the latter makes a Zivug with its Nukva (impure, bitter, %0a%3c and evil force), which, as a result of its connection to the male part, falsifies the %0a%3c Creator's name, descends and instigates man, and then ascends, complaints %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 220 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c against him, and takes his soul. However holy this soul was, Nukva de Klipa grabs %0a%3c all of it for itself. %0a%3c %0a%3c Naturally, this refers to one who works on himself and advances spiritually, %0a%3c for whom working for the Creator's sake is his life's calling. Yet, he may %0a%3c occasionally fail to observe precisely all the restrictions, and thus find himself %0a%3c in such states. An ordinary person, however, who neither works on himself %0a%3c nor studies Kabbalah, is obviously entirely unrelated to either pure or impure %0a%3c spiritual forces. %0a%3c %0a%3c For example, the male impure force says that one must study the Torah, but %0a%3c then steals the results of his work for itself. As a result, man loses interest in his %0a%3c studies, and must once more consolidate himself in his efforts and advancement. %0a%3c And although he attains the Creator and the revelation of Light to a certain %0a%3c degree, it is nonetheless fruitless, for all of his attainments vanish from him, and %0a%3c he gains nothing from them. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, the Torah refers to it as the "reverse man," for initially he ate %0a%3c and drank and said "Go," i.e., raise MAN to the Creator and receive the Light %0a%3c for the sake of the exalted goal, but not for yourself. Thus, it pretends that it %0a%3c is not the impure force, but its opposite. However, due to its property called %0a%3c "fruitless return," it then makes a Zivug with its Nukva (the great abyss), which %0a%3c steals man's soul and destroys him with its falsehood, and man is left without %0a%3c even the slightest part of his soul that is holy and pure! %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, it is written that he skips through 500 Parsaot: initially, ZON of %0a%3c the impure forces have only VAfC in ZA and a point in Malchut. Consequently, %0a%3c they can only be equal to ZON de Atzilut in their Katnut (small state), when %0a%3c they are also VAK and a point, and have neither the power nor the place to %0a%3c connect to Bina. %0a%3c %0a%3c Nevertheless, thanks to the MAN raised by the lower ones, the male impure %0a%3c force is given the opportunity to skip through ZAT de Bina, which sustain the pure %0a%3c and holy ZON. ZON contain Sefirot HGT NH (Netzah-Hod) = 5x 100 = 500, since %0a%3c a Sefira in Bina equals 100. And this occurs thanks to the MAN raised by one who %0a%3c is uncertain of his intentions (whether or not he acts for the Creator's sake). %0a%3c %0a%3c The "reverse man" then makes a Zivug with his Nukva on this false MAN, %0a%3c and receives the Upper Light for the construction of his Partzuf, much like the %0a%3c spiritually pure Heavens that were created on the pure MAN. Also, the new %0a%3c Heavens created on the impure MAN are called "reverse," "empty." And since the %0a%3c impure Malchut took part in this, these Heavens are called Tohu (abyss/ chaos). %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Who Is Your Partner? %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 221 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 69. And this reverse man then flies across the empty firmament, traversing %0a%3c 6,000 Parsaot in one bound. And as soon as this empty firmament stops, %0a%3c an impure woman emerges at once, seizes onto this empty firmament, and %0a%3c partakes in it. She leaves it and slays hundreds of thousands, for as long as she %0a%3c remains in this firmament, she has the authority and power to fly and traverse %0a%3c the whole world in an instant. %0a%3c %0a%3c All that stems from the empty firmament stems from the impure force, which %0a%3c is correspondingly opposite the Supernal, holy wisdom of Ohr Hochma. The %0a%3c Sefira Hochma equals 1,000, and so it is written that it flies across the firmament %0a%3c in 6,000 = six Sefirot HGT NHY of Partzuf Hochma, each of which equals 1,000. %0a%3c %0a%3c After the new heavens of the impure male part, called the "empty heavens," %0a%3c were completed, the power of its female half, Nulcva ("the great abyss"), was %0a%3c revealed. Her force attacked the firmament with falsehood by the Creator's %0a%3c name; she soared through the sky, and the heavens were then called Tohu. %0a%3c %0a%3c Since Nukva of the impure forces partakes in this firmament, she becomes %0a%3c stronger and grows even more than the male level of the impure part. This is %0a%3c because the male impure part reaches up to VAK of Hochma, which equals 6,000 %0a%3c Parsaot, whereas Nukva grows to the full ten Sefirot, i.e., the entire world. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, she is immensely powerful and can destroy many, for, as Rashi %0a%3c says, "The Creator created one opposite the other." And just as new, Holy %0a%3c Heavens and lands are created thanks to the MAN raised by the righteous, new, %0a%3c impure heavens and lands are created through the MAN raised by those who do %0a%3c not know exactly how one should work for the Creator. %0a%3c %0a%3c 70. It is written of it: "Do not facilitate fruitless transgression." Transgression %0a%3c is related to the male part, and is as heavy as wagon shafts. What is this %0a%3c transgression? It is the impure Nukva. With reins she draws the male impure %0a%3c part to fruitlessness. And then, as a result, a transgression is committed, as %0a%3c the male part draws itself towards this Nukva, who grows strong and flies off %0a%3c to slay people. And many does she slay. And who is it that caused all this? It %0a%3c is those that study the Torah, but do not attain Ohrah and Morah (Light and %0a%3c bestowal). May the Creator be merciful to them! %0a%3c %0a%3c As was already mentioned above, the male impure part is not as evil as the %0a%3c female part. This is so because it makes itself similar to the holy part of the %0a%3c creature; hence, it is called fruitless. However, due to this similarity, it has great %0a%3c power to ensnare man, as, for example, just as the sages do, it encourages people %0a%3c to study the Torah. Yet, its goals are different from that of the Creator; it wants %0a%3c to receive wisdom (Hochma), and not to become altruistic. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 222 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c And after one is caught in its toils, the male impure force makes a Zivug %0a%3c with its impure Nukva, and, like heavy wagon shafts, they pull man into an abyss %0a%3c so great and dark that he doesn't even realize that he is in darkness. On the %0a%3c contrary, he considers himself wise and righteous. The male part only catches %0a%3c man, binds him, and then brings him to the impure Nukva and casts him at her %0a%3c feet. Only then does he falter, falls into the great abyss and perishes. %0a%3c %0a%3c 71. Rabbi Shimon said to his friends: "I beg of you not to utter any discernments %0a%3c from the Torah, no matter what you may hear from the Great Tree of Truth, %0a%3c so that you would not assist the impure Nukva in slaying multitudes of people %0a%3c for naught." They all opened and mouthed: "Save us, O Merciful One! Save %0a%3c us, O Merciful One!" %0a%3c %0a%3c Rabbi Shimon said that if you have attained the discernment yourselves, %0a%3c then you are allowed, but if not, you must listen to the Great Tree (the great %0a%3c learned sage, whose wisdom and purity can be trusted) to learn how to work %0a%3c for the Creator. %0a%3c %0a%3c 72. Come and see, the Creator created the world by the Torah. And He looked %0a%3c into the Torah not once, not twice, not thrice, and not four times. Only after %0a%3c that did He create the world. This should show people how not to err. %0a%3c %0a%3c 73. Opposite these four times, the Creator saw, counted, prepared, and %0a%3c investigated what He had created. It is therefore written, "Beresheet (In %0a%3c the beginning) Barah (created) Elokim (the Creator) Et (the)"— four words, %0a%3c corresponding to the four above. And then, it is written: "Heaven"— opposite %0a%3c all four words, for the Creator looked into the Torah before He began to %0a%3c manifest His thought into reality. %0a%3c %0a%3c The four words signify four time periods or four Sefirot H-B-ZA-M. "Saw" %0a%3c designates Hochma, "counted"— Bina, "prepared"— ZA, and "investigated"— %0a%3c Malchut. After these four, the Creator created what He created. %0a%3c %0a%3c We find the same in the Torah: Beresheet is Hochma, Barah is Bina, Elokim is %0a%3c ZA, and Et (the) is Malchut, which includes everything from Aleph to Tav— all the %0a%3c letters and all the properties. Hence, she is designated in the Torah by the word %0a%3c Et = Aleph-Tav (from the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet, Aleph, to the last, %0a%3c Tav). And after these four, He created the Heavens and the earth, i.e., revealed %0a%3c the next, lower degree, below Malchut. %0a\ No newline at end of file%0a
