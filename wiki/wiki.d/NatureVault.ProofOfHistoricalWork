csum=One of PoW's most interesting functions is serving as a cryptographic decentralized clock. Referencing such clock times (blockhashes) in another cryptographic hash gives you proof that something was done no earlier than when that blockhash was created on the network.  In fact, our blockchainless [[Digital Collectible Network]] CollectBit uses a donor blockchain in order to keep time.  However about the fastest a PoW blockchain can provide timestamps currently is 15 seconds.  In the best case scenario this can never be much faster than 1.5 seconds (tick rate) since the speed of light is 0.15 seconds and a blockchain needs 10 times that relay time in order to work on a PoW solution to maintain under a roughly 10%25 orphan rate.  With PoHW, we broadcast all work done, as it is done, not just the solution to a block.  This allows for our minimum tick rate to be around the ping of the network itself, around 200ms currently.  So this increases the "tick rate" of our network by about 10-100x.
