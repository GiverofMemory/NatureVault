Many of these non-biblical  gospels apparently disappeared later, although it's possible that copies of  some of them still survive at unknown locations. Luckily, several that  appeared to be missing have been found again in modern times. But some  are still missing, and could be permanently lost.   Gospels that were left out of the Bible are called noncanonical gospels.  =]%0a
