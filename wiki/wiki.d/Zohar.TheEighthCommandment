text=The Eighth Commandment %0a%0a%0a%0a228. The eighth Mitzva is to love an outsider from another nation, who desires %0ato come under the wings of the Shechina, M.alchut, who takes under her %0awings those who separate themselves from the other, impure side, and draw %0anear her, as it is written: LET THE EARTH BRING FORTH A LIVING %0aSOUL AFTER ITS KIND. %0a%0aMalchut, Nukva de ZA, is called the Shechina, for she does not distance from %0aus even when our properties are distant from her, as it is said: WHEREVER %0aYOU ARE BANISHED, THE SHECHINA WILL BE WITH YOU, and %0aABIDES IN THEM, IN THEIR IMPURITY. ZA is called Shochen (dweller) and %0aNulcva is called Shechina. %0a%0aThe revelation of the Creator in Malchut, of the Shochen in the Shechina, of %0aZA in Malchut of the world of Atzilut is possible only by a face-to-face Zivug of %0aZON in Gadlut. This is because the Light of this Zivug is so great that it reveals %0aunity even in the most remote and concealed places, in the most opposite and %0auncorrected desires. %0a%0aHowever, the creation of Gadlut de ZON occurs gradually: first, a Partzuf %0aof ZON in Katnut is created with the Light of VAK, and only then does it %0agrow to reach Gadlut. Moreover, this process takes place in each state of ZON. %0aFurthermore, even as ZON in Gadlut make a Zivug and receive Ohr Hochma, the %0aLight from their previous state of Katnut does not disappear, but facilitates a %0aZivug in Gadlut. And this Light of Katnut is called the "Wings of Shechina." %0a%0aHence, it is written in the Torah: "And the cherubim shall spread out their %0awings on High, screening the ark-cover with their wings" (Shemot, 25:20). For the %0amain thing is to cover the Light of the great Zivug with their wings, so that even %0athe most distant ones would receive the Light, and, at the same time, keep it out %0aof the reach of the impure forces. %0a%0a421 %0a%0a%0a%0a422 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aThis is so because those who have yet to completely purify their egoistic %0adesires are rejected by the Light for fear that the Light may fall to the impure %0aforces. But now the wings guard the Light so vigilantly that even the closest ones %0awill not err and let the Light through to the impure forces. %0a%0aTherefore, an outsider is one who decides to join the people of Israel (to %0acorrect his egoistic desires and make them altruistic), and to be circumcised %0a(reject his egoistic desires), for his body (collection of desires) still retains the %0aproperties of the Orla, as his ancestors (previous spiritual states) did not stand %0aat the foot of Mount Sinai (did not receive the Light, called the Torah, and were %0anot corrected by it), i.e., have not yet rid themselves of the serpent's impurity %0a(have neither revealed all the impure egoistic desires within them nor recognized %0athem as evil). Nevertheless, other altruistic desires have the power to elevate him %0ato the level of Supernal purity. %0a%0aThis occurs through raising MAN, by evoking the great Zivug of ZON (where %0athe Wings of Shechina rule and cover the Light of this Zivug). We can also elevate %0athe outsider's soul (his yet uncorrected desires) to that level and sanctify it in the %0aLight of this Zivug. %0a%0aAnd although this soul is not yet completely pure, it can receive the Light %0afrom this Zivug, for the wings protect it and do not allow its Light through %0ato the impure forces (desires), even though they are very close to it. And it %0ais said, UNDER THE WINGS OF SHECHINA, for this soul can receive the %0aLight only from the wings of Malchut-Shechina, i.e., receive only the small, %0aouter Light of Malchut. This is not the Light in the body of Malchut (Shechina) %0aherself, let alone that of ZA (the Creator, Shochen). Rather, it is merely the %0aLight of the Wings of Shechina. %0a%0aThe outsider's soul (his egoistic desires) can be corrected (made altruistic) %0aonly during the great Zivug, for only then is the Light protected by the Wings %0aof Shechina. Hence, we (altruistic desires) must first raise MAN for the great %0aZivug, and receive its Light in our souls (desires corrected by the screen). Then, %0athe Shechina spreads her wings, protects this Zivug, and takes the outsider's soul %0aunder them. It follows that initially, we elevate the outsider's soul with the help %0aof our MAN, and then the Shechina takes it under her wings. %0a%0a229. One might say that the soul of Haya exists in Israel and is ready for %0aanything. He specified, "After its kind," which refers to both Israel and to an %0aoutsider. Like chambers and passages between them, the same exists in the %0aland called Haya, under the wings. %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Eighth Commandment %0a%0a%0a%0a423 %0a%0a%0a%0aHere The Zohar tells us that although the new soul (the corrected properties %0acalled the "outsider") receives the Light, just like the properties called "Israel," %0aIsrael receives from the inner Light, whereas the outsider receives from the %0aouter. It was already mentioned that wings designate the Light of VAK, received %0aduring the great Zivug, but from the previous state of Katnut, so as to cover the %0aLight of the great Zivug. %0a%0aThis VAK includes Sefirot HGT NHY, where HGT are called "chambers," in %0awhich one can abide and sit (sitting means Katnut as opposed to standing, which %0ais Gadlut). The Sefirot NHY are called "passages," entrances to the chambers, and %0ait is impossible to sit there; their only role is to allow access to the chambers. %0a%0aThe reason for this lies in the property of Tifferet, the main Sefira in HGT. %0aTifferet is their middle line, a complete Kli for the reception of Ohr Hassadim. %0aAnd the main Sefira in NHY is Yesod, which constitutes their middle line. It %0acontains no property of the receiving Kli, and is used only for passing the %0aLight onto Malchut, for the creation of the Returning Light. Hence, NHY are %0acalled "entrances." %0a%0aAs for the outsiders (to purify from egoistic desires) from the seventy nations %0aof the world (seventy egoistic properties), the chambers in HGT of the wings, %0aas well as the passages in NHY of the wings are prepared for them. They receive %0aOhr Ne/esh from the passages (NHY) and Ohr Ruach from the chambers (HGT). %0a%0a230. The right wing of Malchut has two passages, which are split from this %0awing in two so as to let in two nations that are close to Israel. And under the %0aleft wing there are two additional passages, called Amon and Moav. And they %0aare all called the souls of Haya. %0a%0aPreviously, The Zohar mentioned that there are many entrances-passages, %0ayet now it speaks of only two. This is because it speaks in general: there are two %0aentrances for the nations belonging to the right line, and two entrances for the %0anations belonging to the left line. There are also two nations in all of the right %0aline, which include all the nations of the right side, and there are two nations of %0athe left line, which include all the nations of the left side. %0a%0aThe nations of the right side refer to the two general passages in the right %0awing. And The Zohar does not reveal what these nations are. And as for the %0anations of the left side, generally called "Amon and Moav," there are two passages %0ain the left wing that are meant for them. %0a%0aAll the souls of the outsiders that come from all the nations are collectively %0acalled Ne/esh Ha^a, for they can receive only from the great Zivug of ZON when %0a%0a%0a%0a424 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aZON are inside AVI. Thus, Malchut is called Nefesh Haya, for she receives Ohr %0aHaya from AVI. And since the souls (Nefashot) of the outsiders receive from the %0awings of Nefesh Haya, they are named after the received Light. %0a%0a231. Each wing contains a multitude of closed chambers and halls. From %0athem, spirits emerge and are divided among all the outsiders, called Ne/esH %0aHaya, but each "after his kind." And they all come under the wings of the %0aShechina, but no further. %0a%0aEach wing includes VAK (HGT NHY), called "passages" and "chambers." %0aEach nation has its own chamber in HGT and its own passage in NHY. Each %0areceives Ne/esh in the passages and Ruach in the chambers. It is written that the %0achambers are closed, since HGT de VAK have only Ohr Hassadim without any %0aOhr Hochma; hence, they are called "closed." %0a%0a232. However, the soul of Israel stems from the body of that tree (ZA), and %0afrom there the souls fly off to this land (Malchut). Therefore, Israel is the %0adarling son of Malchut, and is sustained by her womb, and not by the wings %0athat are on the outside of the body. Moreover, the outsiders have no part in %0athe Holy Tree (ZA), especially not in its body. They refer only to the wings %0aof Malchut, and no further. The outsider's place is under the wings of the %0aShechina, and no further. The righteous among the outsiders also refer to %0athe outer side, and not to the inner. It is hence written: LET THE EARTH %0aBRING FORTH A LIVING SOUL (Ne/esH Haya) AFTER ITS KIND. All %0areceive Ne/esH from that Haya, but each according to its kind. %0a%0aZA is referred to as the "Tree of Life" and his Nulcva is called the "Land of %0aLife." For in the state of Gadlut, they both ascend and clothe AVI, who have Ohr %0aHaya (the Light of Life). Therefore, it is said that the soul of Israel stems from %0athe body of that tree, meaning from ZA himself. %0a%0aAnd the souls from that tree fly off to the Land of Life: as a result of a Zivug %0abetween the tree (ZA) and the land (Malchut), ZA gives the souls of Israel into %0aNukva, and Israel receives these souls from her, as opposed to the outsiders, who %0areceive their souls from the wings of Malchut, but not from Malchut herself, not %0afrom what ZA passed to Malchut. %0a%0aThe reason for this is that Nukva has three Partzufim, which clothe one %0aanother. They are called Ibur (embryo), Yenika (nursing), and Mochin (adulthood, %0aGadlut). The big (Mochin) Partzuf is the innermost of the three, and is clothed by %0aPartzuf Yenika, which is in turn clothed by Ibur. %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Eighth Commandment %0a%0a%0a%0a425 %0a%0a%0a%0aIsrael receives from the innermost Partzuf (Gadlut of Nukva); hence, it is %0acalled the "darling son," for it stems from the inner part of Malchut, and not %0afrom her outer part (wings). %0a%0aNHY de Malchut are called "womb," for it is the place where the souls of %0aIsrael are conceived and grown. However, this does not refer to the NHY of %0athe two outer Partzufim, called Vour and Yenika, as they are the wings of the %0aShechina-Malchut. Here The Zohar refers to the NHY of the Partzuf in Gadlut, the %0ainnermost Partzuf (the womb of Malchut). %0a%0aThis is what the words of the prophet refer to: "Is Ephraim a darling son %0aunto Me? Is he a child that is dandled? For as often as I speak of him, I do %0aearnestly remember him still; therefore, My heart yearns for him, I will surely %0ahave compassion upon him" (Yirmiyahu, 31:19). Because the souls of Israel stem %0afrom the inner part of Malchut, The Zohar says that they appeared from Malchut's %0awomb, from NHY of the Partzuf in Gadlut, and not from NHY of the two outer %0aPartzufim, called "wings." %0a%0aThe outsiders (desires for correction) have no part in the Supernal Tree, %0aespecially not in its body. Their place is under the wings of the Shechina, and no %0afurther. The outsiders that come (to correct themselves) are called righteous, for %0athe Shechina is also called the "righteous one." They come under her wings and %0aunite within her. Yet, they have no place above the Shechina, and receive from %0aNe/esh Haya, from a Zivug of Malchut with ZA in Gadlut. But they only receive the %0aportion of the Light called "wings"; hence, they are said to be under the wings %0aof the Shechina, where each receives according to his properties.

They receive %0a%3c Ohr Ne/esh from the passages (NHY) and Ohr Ruach from the chambers (HGT). %0a%3c %0a%3c 230. The right wing of Malchut has two passages, which are split from this %0a%3c wing in two so as to let in two nations that are close to Israel. And under the %0a%3c left wing there are two additional passages, called Amon and Moav.

Each %0a%3c receives Ne/esh in the passages and Ruach in the chambers. It is written that the %0a%3c chambers are closed, since HGT de VAK have only Ohr Hassadim without any %0a%3c Ohr Hochma; hence, they are called "closed." %0a%3c %0a%3c 232. However, the soul of Israel stems from the body of that tree (ZA), and %0a%3c from there the souls fly off to this land (Malchut). Therefore, Israel is the %0a%3c darling son of Malchut, and is sustained by her womb, and not by the wings %0a%3c that are on the outside of the body. Moreover, the outsiders have no part in %0a%3c the Holy Tree (ZA), especially not in its body. They refer only to the wings %0a%3c of Malchut, and no further. The outsider's place is under the wings of the %0a%3c Shechina, and no further. The righteous among the outsiders also refer to %0a%3c the outer side, and not to the inner. It is hence written: LET THE EARTH %0a%3c BRING FORTH A LIVING SOUL (Ne/esH Haya) AFTER ITS KIND. All %0a%3c receive Ne/esH from that Haya, but each according to its kind. %0a%3c %0a%3c ZA is referred to as the "Tree of Life" and his Nulcva is called the "Land of %0a%3c Life." For in the state of Gadlut, they both ascend and clothe AVI, who have Ohr %0a%3c Haya (the Light of Life). Therefore, it is said that the soul of Israel stems from %0a%3c the body of that tree, meaning from ZA himself. %0a%3c %0a%3c And the souls from that tree fly off to the Land of Life: as a result of a Zivug %0a%3c between the tree (ZA) and the land (Malchut), ZA gives the souls of Israel into %0a%3c Nukva, and Israel receives these souls from her, as opposed to the outsiders, who %0a%3c receive their souls from the wings of Malchut, but not from Malchut herself, not %0a%3c from what ZA passed to Malchut. %0a%3c %0a%3c The reason for this is that Nukva has three Partzufim, which clothe one %0a%3c another. They are called Ibur (embryo), Yenika (nursing), and Mochin (adulthood, %0a%3c Gadlut). The big (Mochin) Partzuf is the innermost of the three, and is clothed by %0a%3c Partzuf Yenika, which is in turn clothed by Ibur. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Eighth Commandment %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 425 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Israel receives from the innermost Partzuf (Gadlut of Nukva); hence, it is %0a%3c called the "darling son," for it stems from the inner part of Malchut, and not %0a%3c from her outer part (wings). %0a%3c %0a%3c NHY de Malchut are called "womb," for it is the place where the souls of %0a%3c Israel are conceived and grown. However, this does not refer to the NHY of %0a%3c the two outer Partzufim, called Vour and Yenika, as they are the wings of the %0a%3c Shechina-Malchut. Here The Zohar refers to the NHY of the Partzuf in Gadlut, the %0a%3c innermost Partzuf (the womb of Malchut). %0a%3c %0a%3c This is what the words of the prophet refer to: "Is Ephraim a darling son %0a%3c unto Me? Is he a child that is dandled? For as often as I speak of him, I do %0a%3c earnestly remember him still; therefore, My heart yearns for him, I will surely %0a%3c have compassion upon him" (Yirmiyahu, 31:19). Because the souls of Israel stem %0a%3c from the inner part of Malchut, The Zohar says that they appeared from Malchut's %0a%3c womb, from NHY of the Partzuf in Gadlut, and not from NHY of the two outer %0a%3c Partzufim, called "wings." %0a%3c %0a%3c The outsiders (desires for correction) have no part in the Supernal Tree, %0a%3c especially not in its body. Their place is under the wings of the Shechina, and no %0a%3c further. The outsiders that come (to correct themselves) are called righteous, for %0a%3c the Shechina is also called the "righteous one." They come under her wings and %0a%3c unite within her. Yet, they have no place above the Shechina, and receive from %0a%3c Ne/esh Haya, from a Zivug of Malchut with ZA in Gadlut. But they only receive the %0a%3c portion of the Light called "wings"; hence, they are said to be under the wings %0a%3c of the Shechina, where each receives according to his properties. %0a\ No newline at end of file%0a
