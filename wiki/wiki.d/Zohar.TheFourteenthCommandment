text=The Fourteenth Commandment %0a%0a%0a%0a247. The fourteenth Mitzva is to observe Shabbat, which is a day of rest from %0aall the actions of creation. There are two Mitzvot here: to observe the day of %0aShabbat and to adorn its holiness, namely to receive Ohr Hochma, called %0a"holiness;" and to observe Shabbat as a day of rest for all the worlds, in which %0aall actions are multiplied and realized even before this day is sanctified. %0a%0aShabbat is a state of the spiritual worlds where the Light descending from %0aAbove elevates ZA to AA, Nukva to AVI, the worlds of BYA to YESHSUT, and %0aZON of the world of Atzilut. As a result, man's NRN (whoever has it, whoever is %0aspiritually present in the worlds of BYA) also ascends to Atzilut with the worlds %0aof BYA, and there receives Ohr Haya. %0a%0a%0a%0aZA- %0a%0aM- %0a%0aBYA %0a%0a%0a%0aIt follows that there are two Mitzvot: to refrain from working and carrying %0athings from one household to another. This is so because when all the worlds %0aare completely freed from the impure forces, we must guard against the impure %0aforces, so they do not return and mingle with the holiness of Shabbat. And he %0awho works causes the impure forces to mingle with the pure ones. %0a%0aThe second Mitzva is to adorn the day of Shabbat: through the pleasures of %0aShabbat (the ascent of the worlds of ABYA), man receives (in his spiritual desires %0aexisting in the world of BYA) the Light of the world of Atzilut from Above. This %0aLight of Atzilut is called "holiness" (Hochma); hence, man becomes sanctified by it. %0a%0a453 %0a%0a%0a%0aAtik %0a%0aAA %0a%0aAVI %0a%0aYESHSUT + ZON %0a%0a%0a%0aParsaofthe World of Atzilut %0a%0a%0a%0a454 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aAll purifications and corrections take place only in our work and struggle %0awith the impure forces, preventing us from drawing nearer and merging with the %0aCreator in our properties. It is precisely in the wars with the impure forces that %0awe extract the sparks of the Light that they swallowed up, and each extraction of %0aa spark of the Light from the impure forces and its ascent to the world of Atzilut %0ais defined as independent, individual work. %0a%0aIn the beginning, these sparks were sorted and extracted from the impure %0aforces by the Creator Himself. This is described in His actions in the six days of %0acreation. And when all the extractions of the Light sparks ended, the work was %0aconsidered finished, and the corrected state, called Shabbat, arrives; and it is the %0aday of rest, for there is nothing else to correct. %0a%0aHence, Shabbat is the day (the state when the Light shines in the worlds) %0awhen all the correction work in all the worlds ceases. For every Sbabbat (the %0astate of ascent in the spiritual worlds to the level of correction of all the impure %0aforces), the same state of the perfection of creation's first Sbabbat returns and %0abrings rest to all the worlds of ABYA. All the impure forces become detached, %0aremote, and return to their place (Tebom Raba— great abyss), and all the worlds %0aascend to the world of Atzilut, defined as perfect unity. And we are destined %0ato receive this holiness, the Light of the world of Atzilut; it descends upon us %0athrough our observance of the two Mitzvot: REMEMBER AND GUARD THE %0aDAY OF SHABBAT. %0a%0a248. Because that day was sanctified, the creation of bodiless spirits was to be %0acompleted. Asks: "Was the Creator unable to delay the sanctification of that %0aday until the bodies for those spirits were created?" And answers: "The Tree %0aof Knowledge of Good and Evil contained an evil side that wanted to govern %0athe world. And many spirits separated and went forth, armed, to clothe in the %0abodies of this world." %0a%0aBecause that day was sanctified, the creation of bodies for the spirits was to %0abe completed. This means that the day had been sanctified before the Creator %0ahad time to create bodies for those spirits. It is written about this on the first %0aSbabbat of creation: "And on the seventh day the Creator finished His work, %0awhich He has made; and He rested on the seventh day from all His work, which %0aHe has made." %0a%0aThis passage from the Torah is unclear. For if the Creator completely %0afinished all His work by Himself, then He left nothing for us to do. After all, %0aHe finished everything Himself. However, the Creator sorted the Light sparks %0aand separated the pure forces from the impure ones precisely to enable us to do, %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Fourteenth Commandment %0a%0a%0a%0a455 %0a%0a%0a%0ai.e., to complete this work by making our own efforts in the observance of the %0aTo rah and Mitzvot. %0a%0aAnd the rest that is mentioned here refers only to what the Creator Himself %0ahad to do. Therefore, the Torah says that the Creator finished His work, for %0aHe has completed all the preparations for us, and nothing else is required of %0aHim, for the rest HE HAS MADE for us to do. This enables us to do and to %0acomplete creation. %0a%0aHence, it is written that the Creator did not have time to create bodies for %0athe spirits before the arrival of Shabbat. These bodiless spirits constitute all of %0aour impure and evil forces that drive man to transgressions. And the Creator %0aintentionally left them this way, for it is precisely because they are present within %0aus that we have freedom of will in our work with the Torah and Mitzvot. %0a%0aAs a result of Adam's sin in Malchut, called "The Tree of Knowledge of %0aGood and Evil," pure and impure forces were mixed. At that, the impure forces %0awished to rule over the forces of good in the world, so the forces of good would %0anever prevail over them. Thus, a number of armed spirits went forth, intending %0ato attack the bodies, capture them, and clothe in them. %0a%0aTwo points merged in Malchut: one was corrected by receiving the properties %0aof Bina, mercy, and the other is the strictness of judgment, the result of %0arestrictions within Malchut herself. When Malchut is united with the pure forces, %0aher property of restriction is concealed, and the point of mercy is revealed (item %0a123). Then man is said to merit only goodness. %0a%0aHowever, if man transgresses, he attacks the good point and thereby reveals %0athe point of restriction in Malchut. Thus, the forces that wish to harm and destroy %0athe corrected part and to rule over man become revealed, and this is evil. %0a%0aHowever, if he merits for the point of mercy to reveal itself and dominate, %0ahe can elevate Malchut to Bina, thereby causing Supernal mercy and Light to %0adescend. However, if he does not merit, and the point of restriction is revealed %0ain Malchut, not only does he thereby harm Malchut, but he also harms the point %0aof Bina that unites with Malchut. Thus, this point turns from good to evil, %0afrom mercy to judgment, as restriction is revealed in Malchut herself, and every %0arevealed property dominates. %0a%0aThis is why the point of judgment was revealed in Malchut after Adam's sin. %0aBy this, Adam damaged the point (property) of Bina that united with Malchut, %0atoo, turning it from mercy to strictness, judgment. Yet, the correction of Malchut %0ais possible only with the help of this point, for it is called "goodness." And when %0athis point of Bina is revealed within her, Malchut is called "goodness," too. %0a%0a%0a%0a456 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aBut now that the very point of Bina in Malchut was damaged and turned %0afrom good to evil, the impure force thought that the time has come for it to %0adominate the world and clothe human bodies, meaning Adam and his sons %0a(spiritual Partzufim). In other words, the body (desires) of the impure force %0ainherits the place of Adam's body. Thus, the correction of Malchut from the %0agood point becomes impossible, for no more goodness comes to Malchut from %0aBina, and this property has become evil, strictness, and judgment, due to the %0arestricted reception in Malchut. %0a%0aAnd many armed and destructive impure forces went forth to attack so %0aas to clothe human bodies (desires) in this world, and rule over them. For the %0aimpure force thought that nothing could protect and save the pure forces from %0ait because of the harm that Adam's sin brought to the system of governance and %0athe point of mercy in Malchut. %0a%0a249. However, as the Creator saw this, He roused the wind from within the %0aTree of Life, ZA, and struck the other Tree, Malchut. And the other, good %0aside was awakened, and the day was sanctified. For the creation of bodies and %0athe awakening of spirits on that night of Shabbat stem from the good side, %0aand not from the evil one. %0a%0aSince the Creator saw the strengthening of the power of judgment and %0athe impure forces, their ability to clothe the bodies in this world (completely %0aexcluding the possibility of correcting the world in the future), He roused the %0awind within the Tree of Life and struck the other Tree (made a Zivug with it), %0aMalchut. Due to this Zivug, the Tree of Life passed the spirit of life to the other %0aTree, Malchut, thus enabling Malchut to tear away from the impure forces. %0a%0aAs a result, the good side reappeared in Malchut, as it was prior to Adam's %0asin, and the sanctity of Shabbat descended to the world. That is, although the %0aimpure forces had the strength to clothe in bodies, and were more powerful %0athan the pure forces, and, according to the law, they were supposed to prevail, %0aat that moment the Creator intervened, disregarding the destruction caused %0aby Adam's sin. %0a%0aConsequently, ZON (the Tree of Life and the Tree of Knowledge of Good) %0aunited in a Zivug, as before Adam's sin, and the Light of sanctity of Shabbat %0adescended into the world. This action of the Creator caused Shabbat (the Light %0aof Shabbat) to descend into the world, and the impure forces lost the opportunity %0ato clothe in human bodies in this world. The impure force remained as a bodiless %0aspirit, which enables man to draw closer to the Creator (with his properties). %0aThis is referred to as his return (Teshuva). %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Fourteenth Commandment %0a%0a%0a%0a457 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe creation of bodies and the arousal of spirits on that night of Shabbat %0astems from the good side, and not from the side of the impure forces, for the %0aCreator's action remains in creation forever. Just as on the first Shabbat of %0acreation, the Creator completely disregarded the damage of Adam's sin, instead %0acompelling ZON to make a Zivug, and the day was sanctified as before the sin, %0afor He destroyed all the power of the impure forces, despite the fact that they %0ahad the strength to rule. %0a%0aThe same applies to all Sbabbatot (plural for Sbabbat)— the spiritual ascents %0afor those who exist in the worlds of BYA— during the 6,000 years. Although %0aman is still full of impurity, for he has yet to correct the sins of the Tree of %0aKnowledge, when he makes a Zivug (of the Light with a screen) on the night of %0aSbabbat (in a spiritual state of that name), the impure forces (of man) have no %0apower over him (his altruistic desires). In this Zivug, man assumes the body and %0aspirit of a newborn, as though he was unharmed by Adam's sin, as though he %0ahimself corrected the Tree of Knowledge. %0a%0aAnd despite the fact that man has yet to merit liberation from his egoism, %0athe impure forces have no power over him on that night. Thus, he can receive %0athe bodies and spirits in his Zivug on the side of the Tree of Good, but not from %0athe impure forces. %0a%0a250. And had he hastened on that night to put forward the other side, before %0athe good side came forward, he would not have been able to withstand it for %0aeven an instant. But the Creator provided the remedy in advance. And He %0asanctified the day beforehand. And He warned to appear before the other %0aside. And the world exists. And that the opposite side thought to rule in the %0aworld, i.e., in defiance of it, the good side was created and strengthened on %0athat night. And the good, holy bodies and spirits were created on that night %0afrom the good side. Therefore, the delight of sages who know this spans from %0aShabbat to Shabbat. %0a%0a251. However, when the other (impure) side saw that what it had planned %0ato do was already done by the holy side, it started to check its own forces %0aand properties, and saw all those who perform a Zivug naked and in the %0acandlelight. Therefore, all of the sons born from that Zivug are enslaved by %0athe spirit of the other side. And these naked spirits of the wicked are called %0a"harming," and they are ruled and killed by Lilit. %0a%0a252. And since the day was sanctified, and holiness rules in the world, the other %0aside diminishes itself and hides on each Shabbat day and on each Shabbat %0anight. With the exception of Asimon and his group, who walk secretly in the %0a%0a%0a%0a458 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aCandlelight, to observe the naked Zivug. And then they hide inside the cave, %0acalled Tehom Raba (the great abyss). And as soon as Shabbat ends, many %0ahosts fly and prowl in the world. As a result, everything is corrected by the %0asong of the sufferers, "He who dwells in concealment," to prevent impurity %0afrom governing holiness. %0a%0aAccording to the law, the impure force was supposed to rule in the world, for %0ait was stronger than the pure one, and it was to clothe in human bodies. But then, %0athe earth would have been given over to the wicked, and all the generations in the %0aworld originating from man would have stemmed from the side of the impure %0aforces. And there would have been no chance of correction, for impurity would %0ahave dominated over all the generations to such an extent that there would have %0abeen no opportunity to get hold of the good side even for a moment. %0a%0aHowever, the Creator provided a remedy, thereby forestalling the defect, for %0aHe elevated Shabbat and removed the impure forces, which caused the Light of %0apeace and rest to be revealed in all the worlds. And all the impure forces were %0athrown into Tehom Raba (the great abyss). Thus, the world was revived, as this %0aenabled the creation of bodies and spirits from the pure side in a Zivug of the %0aShabbat night, and the world advances toward the desired goal. %0a%0aSo what does it mean to forestall the defect via a remedy? The whole of %0acreation is based on a cause and effect sequence, and all that transpires not %0aaccording to the worlds' development is called "forestalling" (skipping several %0adegrees, bypassing some of the causes and effects in this chain). %0a%0aAnd since the sanctity of Shabbat came as an awakening from Above, from the %0aCreator's desire, without any desire or request from below, for Adam had yet to %0amake any corrections and draw closer to the Creator in order to merit Shabbat (when %0athe Creator Himself prevented the defect by providing a remedy for the correction %0aof the world), this action on the Creator's behalf is called "forestalling." %0a%0aJust as the impure force planned to assume power over the world, the good %0aside forestalled its actions on that night. For this night that followed the sin %0ain the Tree of Knowledge was given entirely to the impure forces. Hence, they %0athought that they would obviously rule over the world. However, the opposite %0ahad happened— sanctity took their place: pure bodies and spirits were created %0aon that night by the good side. This is because such a preparation took place %0athat all the Zivugim on that night created bodies and spirits from the good side, %0awithout any participation of the impure force. In other words, what transpired %0awas exactly the opposite of the impure force's expectations. %0a%0aTherefore, the time of sages who know this spans from Shabbat to Shabbat— %0afor at this time, bodies and spirits are created from the pure, good side. And %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Fourteenth Commandment %0a%0a%0a%0a459 %0a%0a%0a%0awhen the impure force sees that what it wanted to create was created by the %0aopposite side, it collects its evil powers and searches through the whole world, %0aand sees all those who make a Zivug in the candlelight, exposing their naked %0abodies. And ill sons are made from this Zivug. The impure side sends these %0asons its evil spirits of the wicked, called "wreckers." As a result, they are ruled %0aand killed by Lilit. Garments refer to Ohr Hassadim, the garments of Ima, the %0aintention "for the sake of the Creator." %0a%0aWhen the sanctity of Shabbat comes into the world, and Shabbat rules in the %0aworld, the power of the impure force dwindles and hides on the night and on %0athe day of Shabbat. Hence, this is the time of sages. %0a%0aAnd only the wreckers, called "Asimon and his group," walk secretly in the %0acandlelight, to observe those who expose their Zivug. Afterward, they hide in %0athe ~Nukva of Tehom Raba. Thus, although Asimon has the power to see the Zivug %0ain the candlelight and on Shabbat, he cannot do harm on Shabbat, but must %0aimmediately return to the Nukva of Tehom Raba. Only after Shabbat is over can %0ahe resume causing harm. %0a%0aRabbi Shimon felt the difficulty of explaining the words regarding Shabbat %0abeing the time of sages. For each day (not only on Shabbat night), starting at %0amidnight, the Creator walks around the Garden of Eden and makes Zivugim with %0athe sages. The Zohar asks the same question (Veyikahel, item 194), and answers %0athat there is a difference between a Zivug on a week night and one that is made %0ain the candlelight on Shabbat. On weekdays, the impure force has the power to %0ainflict maladies on the newborns, and Lilit has the power to kill them. %0a%0aHowever, on Shabbat nights, although the wrecker Asimon and his group are %0apresent, he has not the power to harm, but only after Shabbat is over. However, %0aopposite his opportunity to cause harm after Shabbat there exists a correction, %0acalled Havdalah, the separation of Shabbat from the weekdays through a blessing, %0aa prayer, and a cup of wine, which completely annul the power of this wrecker. %0aHence, there is a significant difference between a Zivug on a week night and a %0aZivug on the night of Shabbat. %0a%0aThe thing is that there is a source of Light, ZA, Supernal unity, and a source %0aof fire, Malchut, lower unity (item 209). Also, there are three details in the %0acandle flame (this refers to a spiritual candle, designated in corporeality by a %0awick floating in olive oil): %0a%0a- White Upper flame; %0a%0a- Lower flame; %0a%0a- The coarse part— wick and oil, supporting the lower flame. %0a%0a%0a%0a460 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aThis lower flame is called "devouring flame." It designates judgment, the %0apower of restriction in the candle. Thus, it devours everything below it, the wick %0aand the oil. And the Upper white flame signifies mercy contained in the candle, %0afor white means mercy. %0a%0aAnd he who makes a Zivug in the candlelight will see his children damaged, %0aand Lilit will be able to kill them, for the candle contains the strictness of %0ajudgment, and the impure forces can therefore cling to such a Zivug. Due to the %0astrictness of judgment, their bodies (the impurities contained in the bodies that %0aparticipate in a Zivug, each of which finds what suits them) become revealed. %0a%0aTherefore, a Zivug is permitted only at midnight, i.e., only in the darkness, %0awhen there is absolutely no Light, when Malchut is said to "awaken at night," and %0amercy is revealed. However, if there is some candlelight, it reveals the impurity %0ain the bodies, and the impure forces cling to them. %0a%0aIn the candlelight, the impure force sees impurity in the bodies of those %0amaking a Zivug, and it informs on them and clings to their bodies. However, all %0athe restrictions of strictness and judgment disappear on the night of Shabbat, %0aand the coarse lower flame becomes like the white Upper flame. This means %0athat even candlelight is permitted. Moreover, under the influence of the sanctity %0aof Shabbat, all the impurity disappears from man's body, hence there is no fear %0ato reveal the body in the candlelight. %0a%0aYet, even on Shabbat, when the coarse flame turns white and the judgment %0aof restrictions disappears, the white flame of the candle nonetheless requires %0athe light's coarse part, so it would act as foundation. And the coarse foundation %0adesignates an indispensable presence of judgment and restrictions, for coarseness %0aconstitutes restriction. %0a%0aNevertheless, these restrictions do not appear on Shabbat. This resembles %0aa coin without any image, so its denomination is unknown. Therefore, the %0awrecker, this coarse, detrimental part of the candle that supports the white %0aflame, is called Asimon (Hebrew, Token), signifying a coin without image. %0a%0aThe coarse part of the candle secretly ascends along with the white %0acandlelight, as the candle cannot burn without it. Hence, this coarse part sees %0athe exposed Zivug and can therefore do harm after the end of Shabbat. Although %0athe revelation (exposure) of bodies does no harm on the night of Shabbat (the %0aimpurity of the body remains concealed during Shabbat), as soon as Shabbat is %0aover, the impure force can reveal itself and harm. %0a%0aAnd since, after Shabbat, Asimon and his group return to their forms %0a(properties) and rise up from the Great Abyss (Tehom Raba) to the place of %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Fourteenth Commandment %0a%0a%0a%0a461 %0a%0a%0a%0asettlement, they soar above the world and can cause harm. There is a song: %0a"He who sits in the shadow of the Supernal One," for man saves himself from %0aharmful forces by praying and returning to the Creator: %0a%0a"He who sits in the shadow of the Supernal One (dwells under the shelter of %0athe Supernal One) dwells in the shadow of the Almighty. I will say to the Lord: %0a'my refuge and my fortress, my God, in whom I trust.' Surely he will save you %0afrom the fowler's snare and from the deadly pestilence. He will cover you with %0ahis feathers, and under his wings will you find refuge; his faithfulness will be %0ayour shield and rampart. You will not fear the terror of night, nor the arrow that %0aflies by day, nor the pestilence that stalks in the darkness, nor the plague that %0adestroys at midday. A thousand may fall at your side, ten thousand at your right %0ahand, but it will not come near you. You will only observe with your eyes and %0asee the punishment of the wicked..." (Tehilim, 91:1-8). %0a%0a253. What places do they visit on the night of the end of Shabbat 7 . When they %0acome out in haste and wish to govern the holy nation, they see it standing in %0aprayer and singing this song: "He who sits in the shadow (concealment) of the %0aSupernal One," first separating Shabbat from the weekdays in his prayer, and %0athen over a cup of wine, these forces flee thence and fly away to the desert. %0aMay the Merciful One save us from them and from the evil side. %0a%0aHere the question concerns only the night of the end of Shabbat, but not %0athe night of weekdays, as the night of the end of Shabbat still contains some %0aforce of the sanctity of Shabbat. Hence, although the impure forces rise from %0aTebom Raba and fly to conquer Israel, when they see Israel's actions in song of %0aprayer and in the blessing over a cup of wine, they fly away to the wasteland, an %0aunpopulated place. Thus, people escape their reach. %0a%0aIt follows that impure forces dwell in three places: %0a%0a- On Sbabbat, they dwell in Nukva of Tebom Raba and have no power to %0acause harm; %0a%0a- When Sbabbat is over, they are kept in the wasteland with the help %0aof prayer, Havdalah, separation of Sbabbat from weekdays, and the %0ablessing over a cup of wine. They have the power to cause harm, but %0acan't, as they are in an unpopulated place; %0a%0a- On other nights they are also present in populated places. %0a%0a254. The three that cause evil to themselves: a) he who curses himself; b) he %0awho throws away bread or bread crumbs bigger than an olive; c) he who lights %0athe candle at the end of Shabbat before Israel attains sanctity in the prayer, %0a"And You are holy." And the light from that candle ignites hellfire. %0a%0a%0a%0a462 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0a255. There is a place in hell for those who transgress Shabbat. And as they are %0apunished in hell, they curse him who lit the candle before its time, and they %0asay to him, "Behold: the Creator will thrust you about with a mighty throw, %0aand He will seize you firmly. He will violently roll and toss you like a ball into %0aa large land; there shall you die" (Yeshayahu, 22:17-18). %0a%0aOne wrecker is called the "evil eye." And he loves cursing, as it is said; %0a"Yea, he loved cursing, and it came unto him; and he delighted not in blessing, %0aand it is far from him" (Tehilim, 109:17). When man curses himself, he thereby %0aempowers the evil eye to love cursing, and it rules over him— thus, man brings %0aharm to himself. %0a%0aThere is nothing in this world that does not have an Upper Root Above. %0aEspecially bread, on which man's life depends, has its own special root Above. %0aTherefore, he who neglects his bread brings harm to the root of his life Above. %0aEveryone understands this, but only to the extent of the portion that satiates %0ahim, giving him life. %0a%0aHowever, if a piece of bread and crumbs are smaller than an olive, there %0aare those who neglect and throw them away, as such amount cannot satiate %0aman. Yet, the sages instructed us to bless as a meal even an olive-sized amount %0aof bread, obliging us to treat such portion as satiating, so we have no right to %0aneglect such an amount. And he who neglects it brings harms to himself. %0a%0aThe reason for this is explained in the Talmud: "They asked the Creator: %0aMaster of the world, it is said in your Torah that one should not turn his face %0aand accept bribes. Yet, You turn Your face to Israel..." The Creator replied: %0a"How can I help turning my face to Israel if they observe the law 'down to the %0asize of an olive...'" (Berachot, 20:2). In other words, by accepting an olive-sized %0abread crumb as a satiating meal, we merit revealing the Creator's face, even %0athough we are unworthy of it. Therefore, those who neglect the amount of bread %0athe size of an olive and do not consider it a satiating meal do not merit revealing %0athe Creator's face; hence, they bring harm to themselves. %0a%0aHe who lights the candle at the end of Shabbat before Israel has reached %0asanctity in the blessing, thereby ignites hellfire. This is because prior to that %0amoment, it was Shabbat; its sanctity prevailed, and hellfire has no power on %0aShabbat. Hence, he who transgresses Shabbat and lights the candle prematurely, %0aIgnites hellfire and brings harm to himself, for the transgression of Sbabbat is %0aregarded as the gravest transgression. Hence, there is a special place in hell for %0athose who transgress Sbabbat. And they who are punished in hell curse the %0asinner for igniting hellfire prematurely. %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Fourteenth Commandment %0a%0a%0a%0a463 %0a%0a%0a%0a256. For he should not light the candle at the end of Shabbat before Israel %0aseparates Shabbat from the weekdays in their prayer and over a cup of wine, %0aas until that time, it is still Shabbat, and the sanctity of Shabbat still rules %0aover us. And during the separation by means of blessing over a cup, all those %0ahosts and legions that the rulers appointed to govern the weekdays return %0aeach to their place to resume the work for which they are responsible. %0a%0aThe main prohibition remains in effect only until the blessing in the prayer. %0aNevertheless, one should beware of lighting a candle before the actual separation %0aof Shabbat from the weekdays in the blessings over a cup, as it is still Shabbat. %0aOf course, one can light a candle for the actual separation of Shabbat from the %0aweekdays, i.e., for the blessing over a lit candle. %0a%0a257. As soon as Shabbat starts and the day is sanctified, holiness awakens %0aand rules over the world; the power of weekdays disappears and returns only %0awhen Shabbat ends. However, although Shabbat is over, other forces do not %0aregain their power until Israel says the prayer, "He who separates holiness %0afrom the weekdays." Only then does holiness disappear, and the legions that %0agovern the weekdays awaken and return to their places, each to its above- %0aappointed post. %0a%0a258. Nevertheless, the impure forces do not assume control until the flame %0aof the candle is lit, for they all come from the root (element) of fire, from %0awhich everything originates, and they descend to rule over the lower world. %0aAll this happens if one lights the candle before Israel has finished the blessing %0ain the prayer. %0a%0aMalchut is called the "pillar of fire" (item 209), and the forces that exist in %0athe candlelight are the restrictions in Malchut. It is impossible to use these forces %0abefore the candle is lit. %0a%0a259. Yet, if he waits until they complete the blessing, the wicked in hell justify the %0aCreator's justice over them, and they bring upon him all the blessings, recited %0aby the congregation: "Therefore, the Creator gives you of the dew of Heaven," %0a"Blessed shall you be in your town," and "Blessed shall you be in the field." %0a%0aBy reciting the blessings, we evoke the descent of the great Light, and its %0apower saves us from hell. And since the wicked in hell see this, they regret %0acommitting their sins and justify the Creator's judgment brought upon them %0aby seeing their punishment. And since man evoked such justification of the %0aCreator's judgment, all the blessings, recited at the end of Shabbat by the %0acongregation become fulfilled in him. %0a%0a%0a%0a464 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0a260. "Blessed is he who considers the poor; the Creator will deliver him in the %0aday of disaster" (Tehilim, 41:2). What do the words "in the day of disaster" %0amean? This refers to the day when evil gains power and wants to take his soul %0aaway from him. The word "poor" alludes to someone very sick. "He who %0aconsiders" refers to one who realizes the need to be cured from transgressions %0abefore the Creator. Another explanation is that this is the Day of Judgment in %0athe world. "He who considers" signifies one who knows how to save himself %0afrom it, as it is written: "The Creator will deliver him in the day of disaster," %0ameaning that on the day when the judgment against man dominates the %0aworld, the Creator will deliver him. %0a%0a"The day of disaster" is a state when the impure forces, called "evil," govern %0aman and take his soul away. "He who considers the poor" is one who tells %0athe sick to return to the Creator to correct himself. It is him who the Creator %0adelivers from the rule of the impure forces. %0a%0aThe Zohar continues by saying that there are three sources of evil for the soul %0aof a man that attracts it onto himself. Hence, it advises one who considers and %0ais compassionate to the poor, to appeal to the sick man's heart (he who feels %0asick in his own evil, egoism) to return to the Creator. Then the Creator will cure %0ahim. And on this day of disaster, which man caused to his soul, the Creator will %0adeliver him through this reward. %0a%0aEven if judgment dominates the world, the Creator will deliver him, for %0ahe taught the sick to return to the Creator and explained to them the need for %0acorrection. And the difference in the explanations is that the first refers to an %0aindividual who discovers evil within himself, and the second refers to the evil %0aof the entire world. And here, the Creator, too, will deliver man as a reward for %0afulfilling this Mitzva.

diff:1688309774:1688309774:=1,634d0%0a%3c The Fourteenth Commandment %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 247. The fourteenth Mitzva is to observe Shabbat, which is a day of rest from %0a%3c all the actions of creation. There are two Mitzvot here: to observe the day of %0a%3c Shabbat and to adorn its holiness, namely to receive Ohr Hochma, called %0a%3c "holiness;" and to observe Shabbat as a day of rest for all the worlds, in which %0a%3c all actions are multiplied and realized even before this day is sanctified. %0a%3c %0a%3c Shabbat is a state of the spiritual worlds where the Light descending from %0a%3c Above elevates ZA to AA, Nukva to AVI, the worlds of BYA to YESHSUT, and %0a%3c ZON of the world of Atzilut. As a result, man's NRN (whoever has it, whoever is %0a%3c spiritually present in the worlds of BYA) also ascends to Atzilut with the worlds %0a%3c of BYA, and there receives Ohr Haya. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ZA- %0a%3c %0a%3c M- %0a%3c %0a%3c BYA %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c It follows that there are two Mitzvot: to refrain from working and carrying %0a%3c things from one household to another. This is so because when all the worlds %0a%3c are completely freed from the impure forces, we must guard against the impure %0a%3c forces, so they do not return and mingle with the holiness of Shabbat. And he %0a%3c who works causes the impure forces to mingle with the pure ones. %0a%3c %0a%3c The second Mitzva is to adorn the day of Shabbat: through the pleasures of %0a%3c Shabbat (the ascent of the worlds of ABYA), man receives (in his spiritual desires %0a%3c existing in the world of BYA) the Light of the world of Atzilut from Above. This %0a%3c Light of Atzilut is called "holiness" (Hochma); hence, man becomes sanctified by it. %0a%3c %0a%3c 453 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Atik %0a%3c %0a%3c AA %0a%3c %0a%3c AVI %0a%3c %0a%3c YESHSUT + ZON %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Parsaofthe World of Atzilut %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 454 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c All purifications and corrections take place only in our work and struggle %0a%3c with the impure forces, preventing us from drawing nearer and merging with the %0a%3c Creator in our properties. It is precisely in the wars with the impure forces that %0a%3c we extract the sparks of the Light that they swallowed up, and each extraction of %0a%3c a spark of the Light from the impure forces and its ascent to the world of Atzilut %0a%3c is defined as independent, individual work. %0a%3c %0a%3c In the beginning, these sparks were sorted and extracted from the impure %0a%3c forces by the Creator Himself. This is described in His actions in the six days of %0a%3c creation. And when all the extractions of the Light sparks ended, the work was %0a%3c considered finished, and the corrected state, called Shabbat, arrives; and it is the %0a%3c day of rest, for there is nothing else to correct. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, Shabbat is the day (the state when the Light shines in the worlds) %0a%3c when all the correction work in all the worlds ceases. For every Sbabbat (the %0a%3c state of ascent in the spiritual worlds to the level of correction of all the impure %0a%3c forces), the same state of the perfection of creation's first Sbabbat returns and %0a%3c brings rest to all the worlds of ABYA. All the impure forces become detached, %0a%3c remote, and return to their place (Tebom Raba— great abyss), and all the worlds %0a%3c ascend to the world of Atzilut, defined as perfect unity. And we are destined %0a%3c to receive this holiness, the Light of the world of Atzilut; it descends upon us %0a%3c through our observance of the two Mitzvot: REMEMBER AND GUARD THE %0a%3c DAY OF SHABBAT. %0a%3c %0a%3c 248. Because that day was sanctified, the creation of bodiless spirits was to be %0a%3c completed. Asks: "Was the Creator unable to delay the sanctification of that %0a%3c day until the bodies for those spirits were created?" And answers: "The Tree %0a%3c of Knowledge of Good and Evil contained an evil side that wanted to govern %0a%3c the world. And many spirits separated and went forth, armed, to clothe in the %0a%3c bodies of this world." %0a%3c %0a%3c Because that day was sanctified, the creation of bodies for the spirits was to %0a%3c be completed. This means that the day had been sanctified before the Creator %0a%3c had time to create bodies for those spirits. It is written about this on the first %0a%3c Sbabbat of creation: "And on the seventh day the Creator finished His work, %0a%3c which He has made; and He rested on the seventh day from all His work, which %0a%3c He has made." %0a%3c %0a%3c This passage from the Torah is unclear. For if the Creator completely %0a%3c finished all His work by Himself, then He left nothing for us to do. After all, %0a%3c He finished everything Himself. However, the Creator sorted the Light sparks %0a%3c and separated the pure forces from the impure ones precisely to enable us to do, %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Fourteenth Commandment %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 455 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c i.e., to complete this work by making our own efforts in the observance of the %0a%3c To rah and Mitzvot. %0a%3c %0a%3c And the rest that is mentioned here refers only to what the Creator Himself %0a%3c had to do. Therefore, the Torah says that the Creator finished His work, for %0a%3c He has completed all the preparations for us, and nothing else is required of %0a%3c Him, for the rest HE HAS MADE for us to do. This enables us to do and to %0a%3c complete creation. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, it is written that the Creator did not have time to create bodies for %0a%3c the spirits before the arrival of Shabbat. These bodiless spirits constitute all of %0a%3c our impure and evil forces that drive man to transgressions. And the Creator %0a%3c intentionally left them this way, for it is precisely because they are present within %0a%3c us that we have freedom of will in our work with the Torah and Mitzvot. %0a%3c %0a%3c As a result of Adam's sin in Malchut, called "The Tree of Knowledge of %0a%3c Good and Evil," pure and impure forces were mixed. At that, the impure forces %0a%3c wished to rule over the forces of good in the world, so the forces of good would %0a%3c never prevail over them. Thus, a number of armed spirits went forth, intending %0a%3c to attack the bodies, capture them, and clothe in them. %0a%3c %0a%3c Two points merged in Malchut: one was corrected by receiving the properties %0a%3c of Bina, mercy, and the other is the strictness of judgment, the result of %0a%3c restrictions within Malchut herself. When Malchut is united with the pure forces, %0a%3c her property of restriction is concealed, and the point of mercy is revealed (item %0a%3c 123). Then man is said to merit only goodness. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, if man transgresses, he attacks the good point and thereby reveals %0a%3c the point of restriction in Malchut. Thus, the forces that wish to harm and destroy %0a%3c the corrected part and to rule over man become revealed, and this is evil. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, if he merits for the point of mercy to reveal itself and dominate, %0a%3c he can elevate Malchut to Bina, thereby causing Supernal mercy and Light to %0a%3c descend. However, if he does not merit, and the point of restriction is revealed %0a%3c in Malchut, not only does he thereby harm Malchut, but he also harms the point %0a%3c of Bina that unites with Malchut. Thus, this point turns from good to evil, %0a%3c from mercy to judgment, as restriction is revealed in Malchut herself, and every %0a%3c revealed property dominates. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is why the point of judgment was revealed in Malchut after Adam's sin. %0a%3c By this, Adam damaged the point (property) of Bina that united with Malchut, %0a%3c too, turning it from mercy to strictness, judgment. Yet, the correction of Malchut %0a%3c is possible only with the help of this point, for it is called "goodness." And when %0a%3c this point of Bina is revealed within her, Malchut is called "goodness," too. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 456 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c But now that the very point of Bina in Malchut was damaged and turned %0a%3c from good to evil, the impure force thought that the time has come for it to %0a%3c dominate the world and clothe human bodies, meaning Adam and his sons %0a%3c (spiritual Partzufim). In other words, the body (desires) of the impure force %0a%3c inherits the place of Adam's body. Thus, the correction of Malchut from the %0a%3c good point becomes impossible, for no more goodness comes to Malchut from %0a%3c Bina, and this property has become evil, strictness, and judgment, due to the %0a%3c restricted reception in Malchut. %0a%3c %0a%3c And many armed and destructive impure forces went forth to attack so %0a%3c as to clothe human bodies (desires) in this world, and rule over them. For the %0a%3c impure force thought that nothing could protect and save the pure forces from %0a%3c it because of the harm that Adam's sin brought to the system of governance and %0a%3c the point of mercy in Malchut. %0a%3c %0a%3c 249. However, as the Creator saw this, He roused the wind from within the %0a%3c Tree of Life, ZA, and struck the other Tree, Malchut. And the other, good %0a%3c side was awakened, and the day was sanctified. For the creation of bodies and %0a%3c the awakening of spirits on that night of Shabbat stem from the good side, %0a%3c and not from the evil one. %0a%3c %0a%3c Since the Creator saw the strengthening of the power of judgment and %0a%3c the impure forces, their ability to clothe the bodies in this world (completely %0a%3c excluding the possibility of correcting the world in the future), He roused the %0a%3c wind within the Tree of Life and struck the other Tree (made a Zivug with it), %0a%3c Malchut. Due to this Zivug, the Tree of Life passed the spirit of life to the other %0a%3c Tree, Malchut, thus enabling Malchut to tear away from the impure forces. %0a%3c %0a%3c As a result, the good side reappeared in Malchut, as it was prior to Adam's %0a%3c sin, and the sanctity of Shabbat descended to the world. That is, although the %0a%3c impure forces had the strength to clothe in bodies, and were more powerful %0a%3c than the pure forces, and, according to the law, they were supposed to prevail, %0a%3c at that moment the Creator intervened, disregarding the destruction caused %0a%3c by Adam's sin. %0a%3c %0a%3c Consequently, ZON (the Tree of Life and the Tree of Knowledge of Good) %0a%3c united in a Zivug, as before Adam's sin, and the Light of sanctity of Shabbat %0a%3c descended into the world. This action of the Creator caused Shabbat (the Light %0a%3c of Shabbat) to descend into the world, and the impure forces lost the opportunity %0a%3c to clothe in human bodies in this world. The impure force remained as a bodiless %0a%3c spirit, which enables man to draw closer to the Creator (with his properties). %0a%3c This is referred to as his return (Teshuva). %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Fourteenth Commandment %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 457 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The creation of bodies and the arousal of spirits on that night of Shabbat %0a%3c stems from the good side, and not from the side of the impure forces, for the %0a%3c Creator's action remains in creation forever. Just as on the first Shabbat of %0a%3c creation, the Creator completely disregarded the damage of Adam's sin, instead %0a%3c compelling ZON to make a Zivug, and the day was sanctified as before the sin, %0a%3c for He destroyed all the power of the impure forces, despite the fact that they %0a%3c had the strength to rule. %0a%3c %0a%3c The same applies to all Sbabbatot (plural for Sbabbat)— the spiritual ascents %0a%3c for those who exist in the worlds of BYA— during the 6,000 years. Although %0a%3c man is still full of impurity, for he has yet to correct the sins of the Tree of %0a%3c Knowledge, when he makes a Zivug (of the Light with a screen) on the night of %0a%3c Sbabbat (in a spiritual state of that name), the impure forces (of man) have no %0a%3c power over him (his altruistic desires). In this Zivug, man assumes the body and %0a%3c spirit of a newborn, as though he was unharmed by Adam's sin, as though he %0a%3c himself corrected the Tree of Knowledge. %0a%3c %0a%3c And despite the fact that man has yet to merit liberation from his egoism, %0a%3c the impure forces have no power over him on that night. Thus, he can receive %0a%3c the bodies and spirits in his Zivug on the side of the Tree of Good, but not from %0a%3c the impure forces. %0a%3c %0a%3c 250. And had he hastened on that night to put forward the other side, before %0a%3c the good side came forward, he would not have been able to withstand it for %0a%3c even an instant. But the Creator provided the remedy in advance. And He %0a%3c sanctified the day beforehand. And He warned to appear before the other %0a%3c side. And the world exists. And that the opposite side thought to rule in the %0a%3c world, i.e., in defiance of it, the good side was created and strengthened on %0a%3c that night. And the good, holy bodies and spirits were created on that night %0a%3c from the good side. Therefore, the delight of sages who know this spans from %0a%3c Shabbat to Shabbat. %0a%3c %0a%3c 251. However, when the other (impure) side saw that what it had planned %0a%3c to do was already done by the holy side, it started to check its own forces %0a%3c and properties, and saw all those who perform a Zivug naked and in the %0a%3c candlelight. Therefore, all of the sons born from that Zivug are enslaved by %0a%3c the spirit of the other side. And these naked spirits of the wicked are called %0a%3c "harming," and they are ruled and killed by Lilit. %0a%3c %0a%3c 252. And since the day was sanctified, and holiness rules in the world, the other %0a%3c side diminishes itself and hides on each Shabbat day and on each Shabbat %0a%3c night. With the exception of Asimon and his group, who walk secretly in the %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 458 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Candlelight, to observe the naked Zivug. And then they hide inside the cave, %0a%3c called Tehom Raba (the great abyss). And as soon as Shabbat ends, many %0a%3c hosts fly and prowl in the world. As a result, everything is corrected by the %0a%3c song of the sufferers, "He who dwells in concealment," to prevent impurity %0a%3c from governing holiness. %0a%3c %0a%3c According to the law, the impure force was supposed to rule in the world, for %0a%3c it was stronger than the pure one, and it was to clothe in human bodies. But then, %0a%3c the earth would have been given over to the wicked, and all the generations in the %0a%3c world originating from man would have stemmed from the side of the impure %0a%3c forces. And there would have been no chance of correction, for impurity would %0a%3c have dominated over all the generations to such an extent that there would have %0a%3c been no opportunity to get hold of the good side even for a moment. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, the Creator provided a remedy, thereby forestalling the defect, for %0a%3c He elevated Shabbat and removed the impure forces, which caused the Light of %0a%3c peace and rest to be revealed in all the worlds. And all the impure forces were %0a%3c thrown into Tehom Raba (the great abyss). Thus, the world was revived, as this %0a%3c enabled the creation of bodies and spirits from the pure side in a Zivug of the %0a%3c Shabbat night, and the world advances toward the desired goal. %0a%3c %0a%3c So what does it mean to forestall the defect via a remedy? The whole of %0a%3c creation is based on a cause and effect sequence, and all that transpires not %0a%3c according to the worlds' development is called "forestalling" (skipping several %0a%3c degrees, bypassing some of the causes and effects in this chain). %0a%3c %0a%3c And since the sanctity of Shabbat came as an awakening from Above, from the %0a%3c Creator's desire, without any desire or request from below, for Adam had yet to %0a%3c make any corrections and draw closer to the Creator in order to merit Shabbat (when %0a%3c the Creator Himself prevented the defect by providing a remedy for the correction %0a%3c of the world), this action on the Creator's behalf is called "forestalling." %0a%3c %0a%3c Just as the impure force planned to assume power over the world, the good %0a%3c side forestalled its actions on that night. For this night that followed the sin %0a%3c in the Tree of Knowledge was given entirely to the impure forces. Hence, they %0a%3c thought that they would obviously rule over the world. However, the opposite %0a%3c had happened— sanctity took their place: pure bodies and spirits were created %0a%3c on that night by the good side. This is because such a preparation took place %0a%3c that all the Zivugim on that night created bodies and spirits from the good side, %0a%3c without any participation of the impure force. In other words, what transpired %0a%3c was exactly the opposite of the impure force's expectations. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, the time of sages who know this spans from Shabbat to Shabbat— %0a%3c for at this time, bodies and spirits are created from the pure, good side. And %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Fourteenth Commandment %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 459 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c when the impure force sees that what it wanted to create was created by the %0a%3c opposite side, it collects its evil powers and searches through the whole world, %0a%3c and sees all those who make a Zivug in the candlelight, exposing their naked %0a%3c bodies. And ill sons are made from this Zivug. The impure side sends these %0a%3c sons its evil spirits of the wicked, called "wreckers." As a result, they are ruled %0a%3c and killed by Lilit. Garments refer to Ohr Hassadim, the garments of Ima, the %0a%3c intention "for the sake of the Creator." %0a%3c %0a%3c When the sanctity of Shabbat comes into the world, and Shabbat rules in the %0a%3c world, the power of the impure force dwindles and hides on the night and on %0a%3c the day of Shabbat. Hence, this is the time of sages. %0a%3c %0a%3c And only the wreckers, called "Asimon and his group," walk secretly in the %0a%3c candlelight, to observe those who expose their Zivug. Afterward, they hide in %0a%3c the ~Nukva of Tehom Raba. Thus, although Asimon has the power to see the Zivug %0a%3c in the candlelight and on Shabbat, he cannot do harm on Shabbat, but must %0a%3c immediately return to the Nukva of Tehom Raba. Only after Shabbat is over can %0a%3c he resume causing harm. %0a%3c %0a%3c Rabbi Shimon felt the difficulty of explaining the words regarding Shabbat %0a%3c being the time of sages. For each day (not only on Shabbat night), starting at %0a%3c midnight, the Creator walks around the Garden of Eden and makes Zivugim with %0a%3c the sages. The Zohar asks the same question (Veyikahel, item 194), and answers %0a%3c that there is a difference between a Zivug on a week night and one that is made %0a%3c in the candlelight on Shabbat. On weekdays, the impure force has the power to %0a%3c inflict maladies on the newborns, and Lilit has the power to kill them. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, on Shabbat nights, although the wrecker Asimon and his group are %0a%3c present, he has not the power to harm, but only after Shabbat is over. However, %0a%3c opposite his opportunity to cause harm after Shabbat there exists a correction, %0a%3c called Havdalah, the separation of Shabbat from the weekdays through a blessing, %0a%3c a prayer, and a cup of wine, which completely annul the power of this wrecker. %0a%3c Hence, there is a significant difference between a Zivug on a week night and a %0a%3c Zivug on the night of Shabbat. %0a%3c %0a%3c The thing is that there is a source of Light, ZA, Supernal unity, and a source %0a%3c of fire, Malchut, lower unity (item 209). Also, there are three details in the %0a%3c candle flame (this refers to a spiritual candle, designated in corporeality by a %0a%3c wick floating in olive oil): %0a%3c %0a%3c - White Upper flame; %0a%3c %0a%3c - Lower flame; %0a%3c %0a%3c - The coarse part— wick and oil, supporting the lower flame. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 460 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c This lower flame is called "devouring flame." It designates judgment, the %0a%3c power of restriction in the candle. Thus, it devours everything below it, the wick %0a%3c and the oil. And the Upper white flame signifies mercy contained in the candle, %0a%3c for white means mercy. %0a%3c %0a%3c And he who makes a Zivug in the candlelight will see his children damaged, %0a%3c and Lilit will be able to kill them, for the candle contains the strictness of %0a%3c judgment, and the impure forces can therefore cling to such a Zivug. Due to the %0a%3c strictness of judgment, their bodies (the impurities contained in the bodies that %0a%3c participate in a Zivug, each of which finds what suits them) become revealed. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, a Zivug is permitted only at midnight, i.e., only in the darkness, %0a%3c when there is absolutely no Light, when Malchut is said to "awaken at night," and %0a%3c mercy is revealed. However, if there is some candlelight, it reveals the impurity %0a%3c in the bodies, and the impure forces cling to them. %0a%3c %0a%3c In the candlelight, the impure force sees impurity in the bodies of those %0a%3c making a Zivug, and it informs on them and clings to their bodies. However, all %0a%3c the restrictions of strictness and judgment disappear on the night of Shabbat, %0a%3c and the coarse lower flame becomes like the white Upper flame. This means %0a%3c that even candlelight is permitted. Moreover, under the influence of the sanctity %0a%3c of Shabbat, all the impurity disappears from man's body, hence there is no fear %0a%3c to reveal the body in the candlelight. %0a%3c %0a%3c Yet, even on Shabbat, when the coarse flame turns white and the judgment %0a%3c of restrictions disappears, the white flame of the candle nonetheless requires %0a%3c the light's coarse part, so it would act as foundation. And the coarse foundation %0a%3c designates an indispensable presence of judgment and restrictions, for coarseness %0a%3c constitutes restriction. %0a%3c %0a%3c Nevertheless, these restrictions do not appear on Shabbat. This resembles %0a%3c a coin without any image, so its denomination is unknown. Therefore, the %0a%3c wrecker, this coarse, detrimental part of the candle that supports the white %0a%3c flame, is called Asimon (Hebrew, Token), signifying a coin without image. %0a%3c %0a%3c The coarse part of the candle secretly ascends along with the white %0a%3c candlelight, as the candle cannot burn without it. Hence, this coarse part sees %0a%3c the exposed Zivug and can therefore do harm after the end of Shabbat. Although %0a%3c the revelation (exposure) of bodies does no harm on the night of Shabbat (the %0a%3c impurity of the body remains concealed during Shabbat), as soon as Shabbat is %0a%3c over, the impure force can reveal itself and harm. %0a%3c %0a%3c And since, after Shabbat, Asimon and his group return to their forms %0a%3c (properties) and rise up from the Great Abyss (Tehom Raba) to the place of %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Fourteenth Commandment %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 461 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c settlement, they soar above the world and can cause harm. There is a song: %0a%3c "He who sits in the shadow of the Supernal One," for man saves himself from %0a%3c harmful forces by praying and returning to the Creator: %0a%3c %0a%3c "He who sits in the shadow of the Supernal One (dwells under the shelter of %0a%3c the Supernal One) dwells in the shadow of the Almighty. I will say to the Lord: %0a%3c 'my refuge and my fortress, my God, in whom I trust.' Surely he will save you %0a%3c from the fowler's snare and from the deadly pestilence. He will cover you with %0a%3c his feathers, and under his wings will you find refuge; his faithfulness will be %0a%3c your shield and rampart. You will not fear the terror of night, nor the arrow that %0a%3c flies by day, nor the pestilence that stalks in the darkness, nor the plague that %0a%3c destroys at midday. A thousand may fall at your side, ten thousand at your right %0a%3c hand, but it will not come near you. You will only observe with your eyes and %0a%3c see the punishment of the wicked..." (Tehilim, 91:1-8). %0a%3c %0a%3c 253. What places do they visit on the night of the end of Shabbat 7 . When they %0a%3c come out in haste and wish to govern the holy nation, they see it standing in %0a%3c prayer and singing this song: "He who sits in the shadow (concealment) of the %0a%3c Supernal One," first separating Shabbat from the weekdays in his prayer, and %0a%3c then over a cup of wine, these forces flee thence and fly away to the desert. %0a%3c May the Merciful One save us from them and from the evil side. %0a%3c %0a%3c Here the question concerns only the night of the end of Shabbat, but not %0a%3c the night of weekdays, as the night of the end of Shabbat still contains some %0a%3c force of the sanctity of Shabbat. Hence, although the impure forces rise from %0a%3c Tebom Raba and fly to conquer Israel, when they see Israel's actions in song of %0a%3c prayer and in the blessing over a cup of wine, they fly away to the wasteland, an %0a%3c unpopulated place. Thus, people escape their reach. %0a%3c %0a%3c It follows that impure forces dwell in three places: %0a%3c %0a%3c - On Sbabbat, they dwell in Nukva of Tebom Raba and have no power to %0a%3c cause harm; %0a%3c %0a%3c - When Sbabbat is over, they are kept in the wasteland with the help %0a%3c of prayer, Havdalah, separation of Sbabbat from weekdays, and the %0a%3c blessing over a cup of wine. They have the power to cause harm, but %0a%3c can't, as they are in an unpopulated place; %0a%3c %0a%3c - On other nights they are also present in populated places. %0a%3c %0a%3c 254. The three that cause evil to themselves: a) he who curses himself; b) he %0a%3c who throws away bread or bread crumbs bigger than an olive; c) he who lights %0a%3c the candle at the end of Shabbat before Israel attains sanctity in the prayer, %0a%3c "And You are holy." And the light from that candle ignites hellfire. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 462 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 255. There is a place in hell for those who transgress Shabbat. And as they are %0a%3c punished in hell, they curse him who lit the candle before its time, and they %0a%3c say to him, "Behold: the Creator will thrust you about with a mighty throw, %0a%3c and He will seize you firmly. He will violently roll and toss you like a ball into %0a%3c a large land; there shall you die" (Yeshayahu, 22:17-18). %0a%3c %0a%3c One wrecker is called the "evil eye." And he loves cursing, as it is said; %0a%3c "Yea, he loved cursing, and it came unto him; and he delighted not in blessing, %0a%3c and it is far from him" (Tehilim, 109:17). When man curses himself, he thereby %0a%3c empowers the evil eye to love cursing, and it rules over him— thus, man brings %0a%3c harm to himself. %0a%3c %0a%3c There is nothing in this world that does not have an Upper Root Above. %0a%3c Especially bread, on which man's life depends, has its own special root Above. %0a%3c Therefore, he who neglects his bread brings harm to the root of his life Above. %0a%3c Everyone understands this, but only to the extent of the portion that satiates %0a%3c him, giving him life. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, if a piece of bread and crumbs are smaller than an olive, there %0a%3c are those who neglect and throw them away, as such amount cannot satiate %0a%3c man. Yet, the sages instructed us to bless as a meal even an olive-sized amount %0a%3c of bread, obliging us to treat such portion as satiating, so we have no right to %0a%3c neglect such an amount. And he who neglects it brings harms to himself. %0a%3c %0a%3c The reason for this is explained in the Talmud: "They asked the Creator: %0a%3c Master of the world, it is said in your Torah that one should not turn his face %0a%3c and accept bribes. Yet, You turn Your face to Israel..." The Creator replied: %0a%3c "How can I help turning my face to Israel if they observe the law 'down to the %0a%3c size of an olive...'" (Berachot, 20:2). In other words, by accepting an olive-sized %0a%3c bread crumb as a satiating meal, we merit revealing the Creator's face, even %0a%3c though we are unworthy of it. Therefore, those who neglect the amount of bread %0a%3c the size of an olive and do not consider it a satiating meal do not merit revealing %0a%3c the Creator's face; hence, they bring harm to themselves. %0a%3c %0a%3c He who lights the candle at the end of Shabbat before Israel has reached %0a%3c sanctity in the blessing, thereby ignites hellfire. This is because prior to that %0a%3c moment, it was Shabbat; its sanctity prevailed, and hellfire has no power on %0a%3c Shabbat. Hence, he who transgresses Shabbat and lights the candle prematurely, %0a%3c Ignites hellfire and brings harm to himself, for the transgression of Sbabbat is %0a%3c regarded as the gravest transgression. Hence, there is a special place in hell for %0a%3c those who transgress Sbabbat. And they who are punished in hell curse the %0a%3c sinner for igniting hellfire prematurely. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Fourteenth Commandment %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 463 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 256. For he should not light the candle at the end of Shabbat before Israel %0a%3c separates Shabbat from the weekdays in their prayer and over a cup of wine, %0a%3c as until that time, it is still Shabbat, and the sanctity of Shabbat still rules %0a%3c over us. And during the separation by means of blessing over a cup, all those %0a%3c hosts and legions that the rulers appointed to govern the weekdays return %0a%3c each to their place to resume the work for which they are responsible. %0a%3c %0a%3c The main prohibition remains in effect only until the blessing in the prayer. %0a%3c Nevertheless, one should beware of lighting a candle before the actual separation %0a%3c of Shabbat from the weekdays in the blessings over a cup, as it is still Shabbat. %0a%3c Of course, one can light a candle for the actual separation of Shabbat from the %0a%3c weekdays, i.e., for the blessing over a lit candle. %0a%3c %0a%3c 257. As soon as Shabbat starts and the day is sanctified, holiness awakens %0a%3c and rules over the world; the power of weekdays disappears and returns only %0a%3c when Shabbat ends. However, although Shabbat is over, other forces do not %0a%3c regain their power until Israel says the prayer, "He who separates holiness %0a%3c from the weekdays." Only then does holiness disappear, and the legions that %0a%3c govern the weekdays awaken and return to their places, each to its above- %0a%3c appointed post. %0a%3c %0a%3c 258. Nevertheless, the impure forces do not assume control until the flame %0a%3c of the candle is lit, for they all come from the root (element) of fire, from %0a%3c which everything originates, and they descend to rule over the lower world. %0a%3c All this happens if one lights the candle before Israel has finished the blessing %0a%3c in the prayer. %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut is called the "pillar of fire" (item 209), and the forces that exist in %0a%3c the candlelight are the restrictions in Malchut. It is impossible to use these forces %0a%3c before the candle is lit. %0a%3c %0a%3c 259. Yet, if he waits until they complete the blessing, the wicked in hell justify the %0a%3c Creator's justice over them, and they bring upon him all the blessings, recited %0a%3c by the congregation: "Therefore, the Creator gives you of the dew of Heaven," %0a%3c "Blessed shall you be in your town," and "Blessed shall you be in the field." %0a%3c %0a%3c By reciting the blessings, we evoke the descent of the great Light, and its %0a%3c power saves us from hell. And since the wicked in hell see this, they regret %0a%3c committing their sins and justify the Creator's judgment brought upon them %0a%3c by seeing their punishment. And since man evoked such justification of the %0a%3c Creator's judgment, all the blessings, recited at the end of Shabbat by the %0a%3c congregation become fulfilled in him. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 464 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 260. "Blessed is he who considers the poor; the Creator will deliver him in the %0a%3c day of disaster" (Tehilim, 41:2). What do the words "in the day of disaster" %0a%3c mean? This refers to the day when evil gains power and wants to take his soul %0a%3c away from him. The word "poor" alludes to someone very sick. "He who %0a%3c considers" refers to one who realizes the need to be cured from transgressions %0a%3c before the Creator. Another explanation is that this is the Day of Judgment in %0a%3c the world. "He who considers" signifies one who knows how to save himself %0a%3c from it, as it is written: "The Creator will deliver him in the day of disaster," %0a%3c meaning that on the day when the judgment against man dominates the %0a%3c world, the Creator will deliver him. %0a%3c %0a%3c "The day of disaster" is a state when the impure forces, called "evil," govern %0a%3c man and take his soul away. "He who considers the poor" is one who tells %0a%3c the sick to return to the Creator to correct himself. It is him who the Creator %0a%3c delivers from the rule of the impure forces. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar continues by saying that there are three sources of evil for the soul %0a%3c of a man that attracts it onto himself. Hence, it advises one who considers and %0a%3c is compassionate to the poor, to appeal to the sick man's heart (he who feels %0a%3c sick in his own evil, egoism) to return to the Creator. Then the Creator will cure %0a%3c him. And on this day of disaster, which man caused to his soul, the Creator will %0a%3c deliver him through this reward. %0a%3c %0a%3c Even if judgment dominates the world, the Creator will deliver him, for %0a%3c he taught the sick to return to the Creator and explained to them the need for %0a%3c correction. And the difference in the explanations is that the first refers to an %0a%3c individual who discovers evil within himself, and the second refers to the evil %0a%3c of the entire world. And here, the Creator, too, will deliver man as a reward for %0a%3c fulfilling this Mitzva. %0a\ No newline at end of file%0a
