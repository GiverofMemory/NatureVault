text=The Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aLITERAL TRANSLATION OF THE %0aAFORECITED TEXT FROM ARAMAIC %0aINTO ENGLISH 3 %0a%0a1. Rabbi Hizkiyah opened, "It is written, as a rose among thorns." That a rose is %0athe Assembly of Israel. Because there is a rose and there is a rose, just as a rose %0aamong thorns is tinged with red and white, the Assembly of Israel consists of %0ajudgment and mercy. Just as a rose has thirteen petals, the Assembly of Israel %0ais surrounded on all sides by the thirteen attributes of mercy. However, Elokim, %0athat is here, thought to bring out the thirteen words that surround the Assembly %0aof Israel and guard it. %0a%0a2. Afterwards, this is mentioned another time. The reason it is mentioned %0aanother time is to bring out the five rigid leaves that surround the rose. And %0athese five stand for salvation. These are also the five gates. %0a%0aIt is written of this secret, "I will raise the cup of salvation, it is the cup %0aof blessing." The cup of blessing must rest on five fingers, and no more, just %0aas a rose rests on five rigid leaves that correspond to the five fingers. And this %0arose is the cup of blessing. From the second to the third mention of the name %0aElokim, there are five words. From here on, the Light was created and concealed, %0aenclosed within that covenant, and entered the rose and fructified it. And this is %0areferred to as a fructiferous tree, wherein is the seed thereof. And this seed truly %0aexists in the letter of the covenant. %0a%0a3. And just as the form of the covenant is sown in forty-two conceptions from %0athat seed, so is the legislative, special name of creation sown. %0a%0a4. In the beginning, Rabbi Shimon opened, the flower buds appeared on the %0aearth. "The flower buds" refer to the act of creation. They appeared on the %0aearth when, on the third day, as it is said, "And the earth shall pullulate." %0aThat was when they appeared on the earth. The time of singing has come, and %0athis is the fourth day, when there was a reduction from the Light of Hassadim. %0aThe voice of the turtle dove refers to the fifth day, where it is written, "Let the %0awaters swarm," so as to produce offspring. "It is heard" refers to the sixth day, %0awhere it is written, "Let us stand and create man," and there it is said, "We %0awill do and we will hear." "In our land" refers to the day of Shabbat, which %0arepresents the Land of Life. %0a%0a5. Another meaning is that these flower buds are the Patriarchs who entered the %0athoughts of the future world, and there they are concealed. They emerged from %0a%0a%0a%0a3 The translation in the book is semantic and not literal %0a%0a%0a%0aAn Example of the Original Text of The Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0a37 %0a%0a%0a%0athere in concealment, and concealed themselves in the true prophets. Yosef was %0aborn and they concealed themselves in him. When Yosef entered the Holy Land %0aand founded them there, they appeared in the land (earth) and were revealed %0athere. When are they seen? When a rainbow is seen in the world. It is when the %0arainbow is seen that they are revealed. As the time of pruning has come. The %0atime has come to eradicate the wicked from the world. Why were the wicked %0asaved? Because the flower buds can be seen in the earth. And if they could not %0abe seen, they would not have remained in the world, and the world would not %0abe able to exist. %0a%0a6. Who animates the world and causes the Fathers to appear? It is the voice of %0athe children, who study the Torah, meaning that these children of the world %0asave the world. In deference to them, "We will make you pendants of gold." %0aThose are the children, children of the world, as is it said, "You shall make two %0aCherubs of gold." %0a%0a7. In the beginning, Rabbi Elazar opened, "Raise your eyes above and see who %0ahas created this." Raise your eyes. To what place? To the place where all eyes %0adepend on Him. And who is He? He is one who opens eyes. And you will know %0athis. It is the concealed Atik, wherein lies the question, who has created this. %0aAnd who is He? MI = who. He is called from the edge of Divine Heaven, where %0aeverything belongs to Him. As there is a question, He is along a concealed path, %0aand does not reveal Himself. He is called MI, as there is no question Above, this %0aedge of Heaven is called MI. %0a%0a8. And there is another below, called MA. What is between this and that? The %0afirst one, called MI, is concealed. There is a question in him, because man asks, %0asearches and looks, and beholds from degree to degree until the end of all the %0adegrees. And after he arrives there, he is asked: MA? (What?). What have you %0alearned? What have you seen? What have you investigated, since everything is %0astill concealed, just as it was before. %0a%0a9. It is written of this secret, "Who can I point out to you? Who can I compare %0ayou to?" After all, the Temple was destroyed, and a voice came forth and said, %0a"What can I point out to you, and what can I compare you to?" The word MA = %0awhat, testimony, each day and the day of testimony to you from the days of past, %0aas it is written: "I call to witness Heaven and earth," which is like unto you. %0a%0aAccording to the same type, "I adorned you with holy ornaments," made %0ayou ruler over the world, as it is written: "Is this the city that was called the %0aquintessence of beauty?" and so forth. I have called you, "Jerusalem, a city built %0aby me." "What could be compared to you?" Just as you sit, so he is like Above, %0a%0a%0a%0a38 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0ajust as now the holy nation does not enter into you to perform holy work, so %0aI swear to you that I will not enter Above until I dwell down below. This is %0ayour consolation, as this degree is equal to you in all things. And now that I %0aam here, "Your misery is great, like the sea." And if you claim that there is no %0aexistence or remedy for you, then MI (who) shall heal you? It shall be precisely %0athat concealed Supernal Degree, which animates all things; it shall heal you, %0aand exist within you. %0a%0a10. MI is the upper edge of Heaven, MA is the lower edge of Heaven. This was %0ainherited by Yaakov, that he shines from edge to edge, from the first edge, which %0ais MI, until the last edge, which is MA, for he stands in the middle. Therefore, %0awho has created this? %0a%0a11. Rabbi Shimon said: Elazar, my son, stop talking and reveal to us the supernal %0asecret, which the people of the world know nothing of. Rabbi Elazar was silent. %0aRabbi Shimon wept and said: One minute. Rabbi Shimon said: Elazar, what %0ais ELEH (these)? If you say the stars and the signs of the zodiac, have they not %0aalways been seen? However, MA (what) were created, as it is said, by the word of %0athe Creator were the Heavens made. If it is about concealed things, then it is not %0awritten ELEH, because they are revealed. %0a%0a12. But this secret was never revealed, until one day when I was at the seashore, %0aEliyahu came and told me: "Rabbi, do you know what this is, WHO HAS %0aCREATED THIS?" I told him: "These are the Heavens and their hosts, the %0aworks of the Creator, that man can look at them and bless them, as is written, %0a'When I behold Your Heavens, the work of Your hands, our Master, how glorious %0aYour name is throughout all the earth'!" %0a%0a13. He told me: "Rabbi, there was one thing concealed before the Creator, %0awhich He revealed to the Supernal Assembly, and it is this. When the concealed %0aof all the concealed desired to reveal Himself, He first made one single point, %0aand this point ascended and became a Thought. With it, He drew all the forms %0aand with it engraved all the images." %0a%0a14. He engraved inside a concealed, sacred candle an image of a concealed %0aimage of the holy of holies. A profound structure emerged from the depth of %0athat thought, and it is called MI - who, which is the inception of the structure %0aboth standing and not standing, which is hidden deep inside the name. It is not %0acalled, but only MI - who. He desired to reveal Himself and to be called this %0aname, so He clothed Himself in a precious, radiant garment and created ELEH, %0aand ELEH ascended in name. These letters combined with these, and the name %0aElokim was completed. And until He created ELEH - this, Elokim did not ascend %0a%0a%0a%0aAn Example of the Original Text of The Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0a39 %0a%0a%0a%0ato form the name Elokim. And these sinned in worshipping the golden calf. Of %0athis secret it is said, ELEH is your Lord, Israel. %0a%0a15. Just as the letters MI joined the letters ELEH, so does this name remain %0aforever united, and on this secret stands the world. Eliyahu then flew away, and %0aI could not see him. It is from him that I knew this, which stands on the secret, %0aand its explanation. Rabbi Elazar has come, and all the disciples, too, and they %0abowed down before him, wept and said, if we had (not) come into this world but %0aonly to hear this secret, it would have been enough. %0a%0a16. Rabbi Shimon said, "Onto these Heavens and their hosts were created in %0aMA, as it is said, 'When I behold the Heavens, the works of Your hands,' and it %0ais said, 'MA, how glorious Your name is throughout all the earth, which You set %0aAbove the Heavens, it ascends in name.' That is why it created Light for Light, %0aclothed this into this, and elevated in the Supernal Name, this the Creator %0acreated in the beginning. This is the Supernal Creator, for MA is not such and %0awas not created." %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Rose %0a%0a%0a%0a1. Rabbi Hizkiyah opened (began): "It is said, as a rose among thorns" (Shir %0aHaShirim, 2:2). He asks, "What does a rose represent?" He answers, "It is the %0aAssembly of Israel, meaning Malchut. For there is a rose, and there is a rose. %0aJust as a rose among thorns is tinged with red and white, so does the Assembly %0aof Israel (Malchut) consist of judgment and mercy. Just as a rose has thirteen %0apetals, so the Assembly of Israel consists of thirteen properties of mercy, %0asurrounding it on all sides. After all, Elokim (the name of the Creator that %0aalludes to His attitude towards the lower ones by the force of judgment), as %0ait is said, 'In the beginning, Elokim created' (the first sentence in the Torah), %0aIn the beginning (initially) when He thought it, He created thirteen words to %0asurround the Assembly of Israel and to protect it, and here they are: THE, %0aHEAVEN, ANDTHE, EARTH, ANDTHE EARTH, WAS, EMPTY, AND- %0aCHAOTIC, ANDTHE DARKNESS, OVER, THE FACE, OF THE ABYSS, %0aANDTHE SPIRIT, up to the word Elokim" (In Hebrew, "and" is written in %0aconjunction with the word following it. Hence, it is considered as one word). %0a%0a%0a%0aits object of study, Kabbalah takes the only creation, the only thing that %0a%0acreaks %0a%0a%0a%0aAs its %0a%0aexists besides the Creator— man's self, or "I," and researches it. This science br %0adown the self into parts, explains the structure and properties of each part, and %0athe purpose of its creation. Kabbalah explains how every part of man's self, called %0a"the soul," can be changed so that one would reach the goal of creation, the state %0adesired by both the Creator and man himself, provided he realizes it. %0a%0aThere is not a science in the world that can describe, either graphically or %0analytically, through use of formulas, our sensations and desires, and how diverse %0and multifaceted they are. That is how fickle, unpredictable, and absolutely %0alistinct they are in everyone. This is because our desires surface in our mind %0and sensations in a gradual order, in a certain sequence, so we may acknowledge %0a%0a%0a%0a41 %0a%0a%0a%0a42 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0ais our essence, the only thing that characterizes an indi\ %0aging, and what remains is merely an external, ar %0ahy it is said that every moment man is born anew. Yet, if thi; %0a)Uid we regard one another, and how should we perceive ourselves? How %0apossibly "stabilize" anything within and outside of us if we are constantly %0a>ing, and all that we perceive is a function of our inner state? %0a%0aThe Creator is the source of Light (pleasure). Those who draw near Him %0asense Him as such. Such people, who draw near the Creator and thereby sense %0aHim, are called Kabbalists (from the word Lekabel— to receive the Creator's %0aLight). One can draw near the Creator only through equivalence of desires. %0a;ator is incorporeal, and can only be sensed with our heart. Naturall 1 %0aleant by "heart" is not the pump that mobilizes blood through our vei %0ater of man's every sensation. %0a%0aHowever, one cannot sense the Creator with just his heart, but only with %0asmall point in it. And to feel this point, man must develop it himself. When %0aone develops and expands this point, the sensation of the Creator, His Light, %0acan enter it. %0a%0aOur heart is the sum of our egoistic desires, and the small point within it %0ais part of the spiritual, altruistic desire implanted from Above by the Creator %0aHimself. It is our task to nurture this embryo of a spiritual desire to such an %0a;nt that it (and not our egoistic nature) will determine all of our aspiratior %0are time, the egoistic desire of the heart will surrender, contract, ' %0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0alg born in our world, one is obliged to change his hear %0aegoistic to altruistic, while living in this world. This is the purpose of %0athe reason behind his appearance in this world, and it is the goal of all creation. %0aA complete replacement of egoistic desires with altruistic ones is called "the %0aEnd of Correction." Every individual and all of humanity must attain it in this %0aworld together. Until one achieves this, he will continue to be born into this %0arid. The Torah and all the prophets speak exclusively of this. The methoc %0ation is called "Kabbalah." %0a%0a>ne can change his desires only i %0asolute egoist; he can neither ac %0afrom the surrounding world— as his surroundings are just like him— nor does he %0ahave any link to the spiritual worlds, since such a link is possible only throu£ %0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0aThe Rose %0a%0a%0a%0a43 %0a%0a%0a%0a%0aence, an individual in our world has no chance of transcending %0aies of this world on his own. That is why we were given the To %0aost effective part, Kabbalah— to help man acquire the desires of %0aorlds. %0a%0aIn order to create man in remoteness to Himself, so that man would realize %0ahis insignificance and would come independently to the desire to ascend, the %0aCreator created all creation as degrees descending from Him. The Creator's %0aLight descended along these degrees, and at the lowest degree, created our world %0aand man in it. Having realized his insignificance and wishing to ascend to the %0areator, man (to the extent that he wishes to approach the Creator) ascends %0athe same degrees by which his initial descent took place. %0a%0aIn all, there are ten degrees, called "ten Sefirot": Keter, Hochma, Bina, Hesed, %0aGevura, Tifferet, Netzah, Hod, Yesod, and Malchut. Like ten screens or curtains, %0athese ten Sefirot conceal the Creator's Light from us or the Creator Himself %0a(which is the same thing). These ten screens constitute the ten degrees of our %0aremoteness from the Creator. %0a%0aTherefore, in order to draw near the Creator by one degree, the lowest %0aone above our own properties, we must acquire the properties of that (lowest) %0adegree. This means that our properties become similar to the properties of that %0adegree, rather than remaining inferior to it. To acquire similar properties means %0ato have the same desires. As soon as our desires coincide with the desires of %0athat degree, its concealment fades, and we seemingly exist on it, and only nine %0adegrees separate us from the Creator. %0a%0aHowever, the last, lowest degree differs from all the others: as soon as one %0aascends out of our world and onto the first degree, he already begins to see %0a(sense) the Creator. And all the subsequent degrees are degrees of drawing closer %0ato the Creator. Only the very last degree, at which we presently exist, conceals %0athe Creator completely, whereas all of the Higher Degrees only distance Him. %0a%0aAlthough we count ten degrees, there are in fact only five of them. This is %0abecause six degrees: Hesed, Gevura, Tifferet, Netzah, Hod, and Yesod combine into %0aone Sefira, called ZeirAnpin (ZA). ZA itself is sometimes referred to as Tifferet, for %0athis Sefira reflects the common attributes of all of its six Sefirot. %0a%0aSo, there are five degrees of concealment from the Creator down to our %0aworld: Keter, Hochma, Bina, ZA, and Malchut. Every degree is alternatively called %0aOlam (world), from the word Haalamah (concealment). Every degree has its sub- %0adegrees, called Partzufim (plural for Partzuf), and every sub-degree has its own %0a%0a%0a%0a44 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0asub-degrees, called Sefirot (plural for Sefira). Thus, in all, 5x5x5 = 125 degrees- %0aSefirot exist between us and the Creator. %0a%0aBelow is a table of the degrees from the Creator down to our world: %0a%0aThe Creator: an absolutely altruistic desire to create a soul (man) in order %0ato fill it with delight. %0a%0aThe world of Infinity: the existence of souls in the ultimate, perfect state. %0a%0a%0a%0aWORLDS %0a%0a%0aSEFIROT %0a%0a%0aPARTZUFIM %0a%0a%0a%0a%0aKeter %0a%0a%0aGalaalta %0a%0a%0a%0a%0a1 st World %0a%0a%0aHochma %0a%0a%0aAB %0a%0a%0a( * ) %0a%0a%0aAdam Kadmon %0a%0a%0aBina %0a%0a%0a%0a%0a( * ) %0a%0a%0a(AK) %0a%0a%0aZA %0a%0a%0aMA %0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0aMalchut %0a%0a%0aBON %0a%0a%0a( * ) %0a%0a%0a%0a%0aKeter %0a%0a%0aArirh Annin (AA\ %0a%0ar\\ iv/i i r\\ \vj\\ \ %0a%0a%0a%0a%0a?nd Wnrlrl %0a%0aL.

Because desire in the spiritual %0asignates action, desire itself acts, without a body. Therefore, when the desire %0acreate souls (the will to enjoy) appeared in the Creator, when He wished %0afill them with the most perfect delight— to sense Him and to delight in His %0aperfection— to make creatures just as He is, His desire was immediately realized. %0aThus appeared the World of Ein Sof, in which we already exist in our final state. %0a%0aHowever, we still need to attain this state in our sensations. This is %0areminiscent of a sleeping person: even though he is sleeping somewhere, he %0adoes not understand where he is until he wakes up. However, in order to achieve %0ais perfect state, we must go through a gradual process of transformation of our %0aner properties (desires), which corresponds to the spiritual ascension fror %0ar world through all the worlds, to the World of Ein Sof. %0a%0alead us to the final state, the Creator governs us from Above thrc %0aall the worlds. Thus, there is nothing in our world that does not originate in %0athe World of Ein Sof, where the final state of every soul determines the path %0athat it is destined to travel in general and the changes that it has to undergo %0ain particular at every moment (state) of its spiritual advancement towards the %0aWorld of Infinity. %0a%0aThere is no way back: everything that happens is dictated by the necessity to %0aing every soul to its final state. Only this goal determines the state of our worl %0aery second, what happens to it in general and to each of us in particular. ' %0acreated nothing for naught. Rather, everything serves His purpose. %0a%0aHowever, the will that stems from Above does not exclude our ac %0aarticipation in our own advancement. Instead of being slaves that move %0aunder the compulsion of a beating stick called suffering, we can turn our path %0aof suffering into the path of Torah— to actively and quickly travel this path %0afrom below upwards on our own by realizing that the Creator's purpose is %0aindeed desirable. %0a%0aThis is possible via a request for spiritual elevation— raising MAN, a prayer, %0aresponse, we will receive spiritual strength from Above that will help us %0aour qualities, i.e., to ascend. The entire Torah speaks only of this, and %0agoes further still and provides a detailed explanation of the path itself, %0aif on a map, it depicts what we go through and where (in what state and at %0a:h degree) we are now. %0a%0a%0a%0a46 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aKabbalah studies the structure of the spiritual worlds. The purpose of these %0aworlds is to weaken the Creator's signals (desires) so that we could understand %0athem with our egoism and realize them with our mind. In Hebrew, the word %0afor "world" is Olam (from the word Haalamah— meaning concealment), for %0athese worlds conceal and weaken the Creator's Light to such an extent that %0awe can feel it. %0a%0aDepending on everyone's spiritual qualities, on the degree of one's %0aattainment (complete egoism = our world, partial altruism = spiritual worlds), %0awe perceive the Creator or His Light differently at each of the 125 degrees. These %0a125 degrees amount to just ten, called "the ten Sefirot between the Creator and %0aus," where every lower Sefira transmits less of the Creator's Light, as perceived %0aby those at that degree. The lower the Sefira, the less of the Creator's Light it lets %0athrough to those that are below it. %0a%0aSEFIROT %0a%0aThese are the names of the Sefirot: Keter, Hochma, Bina, Hesed, Gevura, Tifferet, %0aNetzah, Hod, Yesod, and Makhut. However, six of them are combined into one %0aSefira, called Zeir Anpin, so in all there are five Sefirot: Keter, Hochma, Bina, %0aZA, and Malchut. Also, ZA himself (ZA is usually considered a male Sefira) is %0asometimes called Tifferet, since Tifferet is his main Sefira, absorbing within itself %0athe properties of all six Sefirot of ZA. Thus, the Creator created only five Sefirot: %0a%0aKeter— the Creator's desire to bestow delight upon us, Malchut; %0a%0aHochma— the pleasure itself, which the Creator wishes to bestow upon us; %0a%0aBina— passes the pleasure from Hochma to ZA; %0a%0aZA— accepts the pleasure from Bina and passes it to Malchut; %0a%0aMalchut— receives the pleasure. %0a%0aBina consists of two parts: her upper part, called GAR or AVI, is unwilling %0ato receive the Light from Hochma. However, since the Creator wishes to impart %0athis Light to the lower ones, the lower part of Bina, called ZAT or YESHSL7T, %0areceives the Light from Hochma and passes it to ZA. ZA does not want to receive %0athe Light, but Malchut (to the extent of her correction) evokes ZA to receive %0athe Light from Bina and pass it on to her. Hence, we sometimes speak of the %0ageneral reception of the Light by ZA and Malchut, which are together called %0aZON (ZA and Nukva). %0a%0aThe process is such that Malchut— to the extent that her desires are corrected %0afrom egoism to altruism— asks ZA to receive the Light "for the Creator's sake." %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Rose %0a%0a%0a%0a47 %0a%0a%0a%0aTo this extent, ZA requests the Light from Bina. Subsequently, Bina turns to %0aand receives the requested amount of Light from Hochma, then passes it to %0aZA. Malchut (to the extent of her corrected properties) merges with ZA via %0aequivalence of form (desires), and receives this Light. %0a%0aKeter, Hochma, and GAR of Bina do not want to receive the Light, but %0astarting with ZAT of Bina (YESHS L7T), the desire to receive the Light so as to %0apass it to the lower ones appears in the Sefirot. %0a%0a%0a%0aKeter %0a%0a%0aGalgalta or Metzah - forehead %0a%0a%0a"bestowal" %0aGE %0a%0a%0aHochma %0a%0a%0aEynaim - eyes %0a%0a%0a_.

This desire is to enjoy the Creator's Light or the Creator %0a(which is the same thing) is the essence of Malchut. We are parts of Malchut. %0aHowever, if we have only egoistic desires, we feel the Creator's Light as pleasures %0ain our world. This is a micro dose of His Light. By correcting our desires %0a(properties), we can ascend the spiritual degrees of the Upper Worlds, and there %0aexperience the Creator's true delight. %0a%0aAccording to the Thought of Creation, Malchut must receive the Light from %0athe four previous Sefirot, and delight in it. Hence, Malchut herself consists of five %0aparts: she receives the Light from the preceding Sefirot in four parts, and senses %0ait in the fifth. %0a%0aAll the Sefirot that precede Malchut (excluding Malchut) are similar to our %0asensory organs, and Malchut is like the heart that receives from all organs: brain, %0asight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch. The heart is Malchut, and the sensory %0aorgans are the first nine Sefirot that precede Malchut. All of these parts of Malchut %0aare egoistic— they wish to receive the Light (pleasure) so as to enjoy it. With such %0aproperties, Malchut cannot receive more than a micro dose of the Light of our %0aworld, sensing the Creator in a manner called "this world." %0a%0a%0a%0a48 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aHowever, if Malchut, i.e., every one of us, were to receive desires (aspirations) %0afrom Above to bestow delight upon the Creator to the same extent that we feel %0athe Creator bestowing upon us, with this property (desire), man would ascend %0aspiritually to a degree above our world. He would sense the Creator as spiritual %0aLight, altruistic pleasure and great knowledge, attainment of supernal thoughts %0aand the essence of existence. %0a%0aSCREEN %0a%0aMalchut (man) can receive the Light only in anti-egoistic desires. If such desires %0aappear in Malchut as a result of the realization that egoism is her enemy (with %0athe help of Kabbalah), to the extent of her hatred for it, Malchut can repel %0athe egoistic pleasures for the sake of spiritual perfection, i.e., similarity to the %0aCreator in her desire to please Him and act for His sake. %0a%0aThis ability to repel selfish reception of pleasure is called "a screen," and %0athe repelled pleasure is called "Returning Light," and the pleasure that comes to %0aMalchut is called "Direct Light." It is precisely in the repelled pleasure, meaning %0ain the desire to bestow whole-heartedly, selflessly, that man can sense the %0aCreator's Light and Supreme Knowledge. %0a%0aSince Malchut (man's egoism) has to repel pleasure from the five parts of her %0aegoism, the reflecting screen must also consist of five parts. Hence, it creates five %0aparts of the Returning Light. The five parts in Malchut are called by the names %0aof the Sefirot from which they receive. The five kinds of Direct Light are called %0aNRNHY: Nefesh, Ruach, Neshama, Haya and Yechida. The Light that emanates %0afrom the Creator descends in the following order: %0a%0aYechida %0a%0aHaya %0a%0aNeshama %0a%0aRuach %0a%0aNefesh %0a%0aPARTZUF %0a%0aAfter Malchut reflects the Light (pleasure), she decides to receive it in order to %0adelight the Creator, because He wants Malchut to receive pleasure and feel Him. %0aThe reflection of all the incoming pleasure is called Rosh (head). The partial %0areception of the Light to the extent of one's anti-egoistic powers is called Toch %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Rose %0a%0a%0a%0a49 %0a%0a%0a%0a(interior). The unfulfilled desires (due to the absence of a screen on them) are %0acalled So/ (end) (see below diagram). %0a%0aThis is the structure of the soul (KU, vessel, corrected altruistic desire, Partzuf %0aor spiritual body). We call the parts of the spiritual structure by the names of our %0aphysiological body: head, body, and limbs. There are five parts in the Rosh (head): %0askull— Galgalta, eyes— Eynairn, ears— Awznaim, nose— Hotem, and mouth— Peh. %0aThere are five parts in the Guf (body) from the mouth— Peh to the navel— Tabur. In %0athe limbs, there are five parts from the navel to the toes (see below diagram). %0a%0a%0a%0a/ %0a%0a%0a%0aOhrMakif %0a(Surrounding Light) %0a%0a%0a%0a\ %0a%0aOhrYashar * %0a%0a%0a%0a%0a50 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aTHE INVERSE PROPORTION BETWEEN THE VESSEL %0aAND THE LIGHT %0a%0aThe more strength Malchut has to oppose egoism, the greater the Light that %0aenters her. However, although one works on the correction of the vessel's coarser %0apart, he receives the Light from his efforts in his subtler desires. In other words, %0athere is an inverse proportion between the vessel and the Light: the coarser the %0adesire (Kli) that is corrected, the greater the Light that enters Malchut (vessel); %0ahowever, it enters her Upper Kli (desire). %0a%0aSince Malchut (i.e., all that exists apart from the Creator) is absolutely %0aegoistic, she can only be corrected by imparting onto herself the properties of %0aBina, the Creator— bestowal without reception. This is the property of absolute %0aaltruism, of selfless bestowal. To receive such a property (desire) is tantamount %0ato ascending from the level of Malchut to the level of Bina. %0a%0a%0a%0aSEFIRA %0a%0a%0a%0aLIGHT %0a%0a%0a%0a%0aKeter %0a%0a%0a%0a%0aHochma %0a%0a%0a%0a%0aBina %0a%0a%0a%0a%0aZA %0a%0a%0a%0a%0aMalchut %0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0aIf all parts of the Kli can %0areceive the Light, then %0aall the outside Light %0aenters the Sefirot: %0a%0a%0a%0aSEFIRA %0a%0a%0aLIGHT %0a%0a%0aKeter %0a%0a%0aYechida %0a%0a%0aHochma %0a%0a%0aHaya %0a%0a%0aBina %0a%0a%0aNeshama %0a%0a%0aZA %0a%0a%0aRuach %0a%0a%0aMalchut %0a%0a%0aNefesh %0a%0a%0a%0aMalchut herself is the will to receive pleasure. The ban imposed on the %0areception of pleasure for oneself is called the First Restriction (Tzimtzum Aleph). %0aRestriction is a ban on the reception of pleasure; however, if the receiver aspires %0ato please the Creator and not himself, he is allowed to receive the pleasure. %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Rose %0a%0a%0a%0a51 %0a%0a%0a%0aWhether Malchut wants it or not, if she (soul, man) has egoistic desires, the %0aLight will not enter her (be felt within her). Hence, we are utterly unable to feel %0athe spiritual (the Creator). %0a%0aTHE STATE OF KATNUT (SMALLNESS) %0a%0aYet, Malchut is not the only Sefira that cannot receive the Light: from the world %0aof Atzilut and below, Sefirot Bina and ZA cannot receive the Light either. This %0aban is called the Second Restriction (T?imt?um Bet). In this restriction, Malchut %0aseemingly ascends in her desires to Sefira Bina. Her desires of "reception" %0adominate three Sefirot: Bina, ZA, and Malchut, as Sefirot Bina and ZA also fall %0aunder the rule (desire) of the elevated Malchut. %0a%0aIf a Partzuf has no strength to oppose its egoistic desires of reception in %0aSefirot Bina, ZA and Malchut (AHP), its lower part is not entitled to receive the %0aCreator's Light, as it will receive it selfishly, thereby causing great harm to itself. %0aTo avoid this, the upper part of the Partzuf— Sefirot Keter and Hochma (GE)— %0aseparates from the lower part by Parsa (partition), through which the Light %0acannot pass downwards. Therefore, as a result of Malchut 's ascent to Bina, each %0adegree was divided into two parts: %0a%0a%0a%0aKeter -Galgalta %0a%0a%0a%0aHochma - Eynaim %0a%0a%0a%0aTogether called Galgalta %0aEynaim (GE) %0a%0aParsa = elevated Malchut — %0a%0a%0a%0aBina - Awzen %0a%0a%0a%0aZA-Hotem %0a%0a%0a%0aMalchut - Peh %0a%0a%0a%0aTogether called AHP %0a(Awzen, Hotem, and Peh) %0a%0a%0a%0aMalchut restricted the spreading of Light inside the Partzuf, and two parts %0awere formed in her: GE receives the Light, i.e., Sefirot Keter and Hochma receive %0athe Lights Ne/esh and Ruach, while the other part of the Partzuf (Sefirot Bina, %0aZA, and Malchut) is below the Parsa, and therefore does not receive the Light. %0aTheir corresponding Lights— Neshama, Ha^a and Yechida— also remain outside %0aof the Partzuf. %0a%0a%0a%0a52 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aLIGHT %0a%0a%0a%0aSEFIRA %0a%0a%0aYechida %0a%0a%0a%0a%0aHaya %0a%0a%0aNeshama %0a%0a%0aKeter %0a%0a%0aRuach %0a%0a%0a%0a%0aGE %0a%0a%0aHochma %0a%0a%0aNefesh %0a%0a%0a%0a%0aBina %0a%0a%0aAHP %0a%0a%0aZA %0a%0a%0aMalchut %0a%0a%0a%0aThis degree (Partzuf) is deprived of the Light Nesharna-Haya-Yechida and is left %0awith just the Light Nefesh-Ruach, called "air." This is designated by the entry of %0athe letter Yod into the word Light (Ohr = Aleph-Vav-Reish). Thus, the word Light %0a(Ohr) turns into air (Avir = Aleph-Vav-Yod-Reish). This state of the vessel is called %0aKatnut (small state). In other words, the ascent of Malchut to Bina is designated %0aby the entry of the letter Yod into the word Light (Ohr = Aleph-Vav-Reish +Yod = %0aAleph-Vav-Yod-Reish = Avir— air). This means that because of Malchut's ascent to %0aBina, the Partzuf lost its Light and was left with air. %0a%0aIn such a state, the degree or Partzuf is called Katnut (smallness), where %0aSefirot Keter and Hochma have only the Light Nefesh-Ruach, as Sefirot Bina, ZA and %0aMalchut are below the Parsa, and do not receive the Light. The Parsa prevents %0athe Light from spreading below it. Sefirot Keter-Hochma and Bina-ZA-Malchut are %0adesignated by the following letters: %0a%0a%0a%0aKeter %0a%0a%0a- Mem - %0a%0a%0aM %0a%0a%0aHochma %0a%0a%0a- Yod - %0a%0a%0a1 %0a%0a%0aBina %0a%0a%0a- Hey - %0a%0a%0aH %0a%0a%0aZA %0a%0a%0a- Lamed - %0a%0a%0aLO %0a%0a%0aMalchut %0a%0a%0a- Aleph - %0a%0a%0aE %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Rose %0a%0a%0a%0a53 %0a%0a%0a%0aIn the reverse order, these letters form the Creator's name Elokirn, where %0aGE = letters Mem + Yod = IM (pronounced as MI), and AHP = letters Aleph + %0aLamed + Hey = ELEH. Since man attains the Creator from below upwards, the %0aCreator's name ELOKIM is read from below upwards. %0a%0aAfter the birth of all the worlds and the descent of the entire Creation to %0aour world, all the Partzufim of the world of Atzilut and the worlds of BYA passed %0ainto the state of Katnut. Thus, the Light is present in GE, but absent in AHP. %0aAHP of the Upper Degree fell into GE of the lower degree, thus forming the %0aspiritual ladder between the Creator and man in our world, and the lowest part %0aof the last spiritual degree of the world of Assiya fell into a point in man's heart. %0aConsequently, all the intermediate degrees now exist one inside the other: AHP %0aof the Upper Degree is inside GE of the lower one: %0a%0a%0a%0aTHE CREATOR %0a%0a%0a%0aThe descent of the Light from the Creator down to man in our world %0a%0a%0a%0aTHE WORLD OF AK %0a, , The head of AA ("unattainable") is considered Infinity %0a%0a%0a%0aK %0a_H %0a%0aZA %0aM %0a%0a%0a%0aThe world of Atzilut = GE and AHP fell into the world of Beria %0a%0a%0a%0aK %0a_H %0a%0a~ B J %0a%0aZA %0a%0aM %0a%0a%0a%0aThe world of Beria = GE and AHP of the world of Atzilut %0a%0a%0a%0aK %0a_H %0a%0aZA %0aM %0a%0a%0a%0aThe world of Yetzira = GE and AHP of the world of Beria %0a%0a%0a%0aK %0a_H %0a%0aZA %0aM %0a%0a%0a%0aThe world of Assiya = GE and AHP of the world of Yetzira %0a%0a%0a%0aOur world = man's point in the heart, %0awhich contains AHP of the world of Assiya %0a%0a%0a%0aThe sum of man's desires is referred to as his heart. Since the nature with %0awhich we are born is absolute egoism, man does not feel the spiritual point %0ain his heart. However, at some point in one of his reincarnations, man begins %0ato gradually strive towards attainment of the causes of life, its evaluation; he %0a%0a%0a%0a54 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0ayearns to attain himself, his source, just as you do right now. Man's aspiration %0ato the Creator is precisely this aspiration to attain his origin. Man's discontent %0ain life often helps him in this search, when there's nothing that appeals to him %0ain his surroundings. Such circumstances are sent from Above in order for man %0ato start feeling an empty point in his heart, and to stimulate in him the desire %0ato fulfill it. %0a%0aThe Creator manifests as the altruistic property to bestow pleasure without %0aany benefit for Himself. From this, we can understand the property of Sefirot %0aKeter, Hochma, and Bina that share the Creator's property of bestowal. The only %0aCreation is Malchut, the will to receive the Light (pleasure). All of us and our %0aentire world are the lowest part of this egoistic Malchut. %0a%0aTHE STATE OF QADLUT (GREATNESS/ADULTHOOD) %0a%0aHowever, if one (Malchut) raises MAN, the request for his spiritual ascent, by %0amaking efforts to free himself from egoism and by praying to the Creator for %0ahelp, the Light AB-SAG descends from Above. It comes from the world of AK, %0abrings Malchut altruistic strength and enables her to return from Bina back to %0aher place. In other words, Malchut's ability to refrain from selfish reception of %0apleasure is complemented with the strength to receive pleasure for the Creator's %0asake, to receive the Light of Hochma within AHP, for His sake. %0a%0aSubsequently, AHP, or Sefirot Bina, ZA and Malchut, become reactivated, the %0aPartzuf regains all five Kelim (parts), the letter Yod disappears from the word Avir %0a(air), and it turns to being Ohr (Light). In that state, all five Lights NRNHY fill %0athe Partzuf, the letters MI join the letters ELEH, forming the Creator's name— %0aElokim. This state is called Gadlut (greatness/ adulthood). %0a%0aASCENT OF THE LOWER ONE TO THE UPPER ONE %0a%0aAs a result of Malchut's ascent to Bina, the Upper Partzuf establishes contact with %0athe lower one. As a result, the lower Partzuf can ascend to the level of the Upper %0aOne. This is the reason for the second restriction: to give the lower ones (man) %0athe opportunity to ascend to the World of Infinity, up to the Creator Himself. %0a%0aIn order to establish this contact, the Upper Partzuf deliberately diminishes %0aitself, descends to the level of the lower Partzuf, and becomes similar to the lower %0aone in its properties. AHP of the Upper Partzuf willingly falls into GE of the %0alower one, as though it has no strength to receive the Light, and they become %0aa single whole. This is similar to a scenario when a strong individual joins a %0asociety of criminals, imitating their behavior, so that after being admitted into %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Rose %0a%0a%0a%0a55 %0a%0a%0a%0atheir circle and establishing contact with them, he will gradually influence and %0acorrect them. %0a%0aHow? The Upper Light (the so-called Light of AB-SAG) comes and provides %0aAHP of the Upper Partzuf with the strength to ascend to their GE. And GE of the %0alower Partzuf ascend together with them: because they were a single whole and %0aequivalent in their properties below, they receive the same strength to ascend. %0a%0aUpon receiving the Light of AB-SAG, GE of the lower Partzuf become %0alike Upper One. Therefore, we should not regard the second restriction as %0anegative, but as help from the Upper Partzuf. It descends to the lower Partzuf by %0acorrupting its own properties in order to equalize itself with the lower one, so as %0ato subsequently ascend together with it to its previous level. This way, the lowest %0adegree can ascend not only to the next Higher One, but also to the Highest %0aDegree of the spiritual ladder. %0a%0aTHE LIGHT OF ZON IS THE LIGHT OF THE WORLDS BYA %0a%0aPartzuf YESHSUT is AHP of Partzuf Bina of the world of Atzilut, and all that it %0areceives and passes to ZON of the world of Atzilut subsequently descends to the %0aworlds of BYA and then to us. %0a%0aIn the small state (Katnut), AHP of YESHSUT falls into ZON. Then %0aYESHSUT receives strength, and by elevating its AHP, it elevates ZON, too. %0aBy ascending to YESHSUT, ZON become similar to it and receive the Light %0aat the level of YESHSUT. ZON can never receive the Light of Hochma in their %0aown level; they can only receive the Light of Hassadim, the Light essential to %0atheir existence. %0a%0aZON of the world of Atzilut are called Olam (world), just as our world is also %0acalled Olam, for all that ZON de Atzilut receive can be received by man in this %0aworld. And vice versa— all that ZON de Atzilut cannot receive is unattainable to %0aman, for we attain only up to the level of ZON, and not higher. %0a%0aAnd since ZON cannot receive the Light of Hochma in their place, the %0aCreator purposely initiated the second restriction, thereby lowering the Sefirot %0aof AHP of Partzuf YESHSUT down to ZON, so that ZON would be able to %0aascend to YESHSUT and higher, up to the Highest Degree. Hence, it is said %0ain the Torah (Beresheet BaraK): "In the beginning the Creator created all in %0ajudgment (restriction), but after seeing that the world (ZON) cannot exist %0a(receive all of the Light of Hochma prepared for it), added to judgment the %0aproperty of mercy." %0a%0a%0a%0a56 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aIn the beginning, He elevated Malchut (the restriction of YESHSUT, for %0aMalchut is restricted from receiving Light) to Bina (mercy of YESHSUT). As a %0aresult, AHP of YESHSUT fell into ZON and merged with them. However, the %0aworld (ZON) still cannot exist in this way. Hence, the Creator added mercy to %0ajudgment: He gave YESHSUT the strength to elevate its AHP together with ZON %0ato the degree of YESHSUT. There, ZON receive the Light of YESHSUT and pass %0ait down to all the worlds of BYA and to our world. %0a%0aCORRECTION IN THREE LINES %0a%0aEach of the ten Sefirot in turn consists of ten individual sub-Sefirot. Malchut %0aascends to Bina in each individual Sefira, i.e., to the full height of the ten %0aSefirot; in each particular Sefira, Malchut moves up from its place to the place %0aof Bina in that Sefira: %0a%0a(M-ZA-|B-H-K)-K %0a(M-ZA-|B-H-K)-H %0a(M-ZA-|B-H-K)-B %0a(M-ZA-|B-H-K)-ZA %0a(M-ZA-I B-H-K)-M %0a%0aThe sign | signifies a particular Parsa in a Sefira, the restriction imposed on %0athe spreading of Light. GE that remain in each Sefira above the Parsa are called %0athe "right line," for there is Light in them. Malchut that ascends to Bina in each %0aSefira creates the "left line" with her restriction on the reception of Light. A %0aZivug made on the elevated Malchut (only on the free, unrestricted Kelim KHB) %0aallows the Light of Hassadim to shine in GE, and this reception of the Light of %0aHassadim in GE is called the "middle line." %0a%0aNow let us clarify what is written in The Zohar: There are ten Sefirot: Keter %0a(K), Hochma (H), Bina (B), Hesed (H), Gevura (G), Tifferet (T), Netzah (N), Hod %0a(H), Yesod (Y), and Malchut (M). However, there are actually only five of them: %0aKeter (K), Hochma (H), Bina (B), Tifferet (T), and Malchut (M). This is because %0aTifferet (alternatively called Zeir An£>in— ZA) consists of six Sefirot, from Hesed to %0aYesod. Five Sefirot KHB-ZA-M created five Partzufim in each world. In the world %0aof Atzilut, these Partzufim are Arich Anpin (AA), Aba ve Ima (AVI), and Zeir An£>in %0aand Nukva (ZON). Keter is called AA; correspondingly, Hochma and Bina are %0acalled AVI; and ZA (Tifferet) and Malchut are called ZON. %0a%0aThe essence of the seven days of creation lies in Partzufim ZA and Nukva of %0athe world of Atzilut, which consist of seven Sefirot: HGT-NHYM. And from the %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Rose %0a%0a%0a%0a57 %0a%0a%0a%0adescription of creation it transpires how AVI (Hochma and Bina) beget ZON (all %0aof creation, including us) and elevate them to their final state during the 6,000 %0ayears. This is what The Book of Zohar tells us. %0a%0aRabbi Hizkiyah began his explanation of Nukva of the world of Atzilut %0aby clarifying the birth of ZON from Ima (Bina), called Elokim. That is why he %0abegan his explanation with a rose, Nukva of ZA. At the utmost completion of %0aits development, Nukva of ZA is called Knesset Israel, the Assembly of Israel. %0aFor Nukva consists of all the souls called Israel; hence, it is said that a rose is %0aKnesset Israel. %0a%0aThere are two states in a rose (Malchut). The lowest, initial, small state %0a(Katnut) is when Malchut consists only of Sefira Keter filled with the Light %0aNefesh, while her other nine Sefirot are those that fell from the world of Atzilut %0ato the world of Beria. The other state of Nukva is mature, big, complete %0a(Gadlut), when her nine Sefirot ascend from the world of Beria back to the %0aworld of Atzilut, and complete the full ten Sefirot of her Partzuf. Then, being %0aequal to her husband, Malchut ascends together with him to AVI and clothes %0athem, i.e., receives their Light. %0a%0aThe clothing of the lower, outer Partzuf onto the Upper, Inner One means %0athat the lower Partzuf attains a part of the Upper One, ascends to a Higher %0aspiritual level, and becomes in some way similar to the Upper Partzuf. %0a%0aIn that state, ZA is called Israel, from the letters LI (to me) and ROSH %0a(head), which signifies the state of Gadlut, while Nukva is called "the Assembly %0aof Israel," for she accumulates all of the Light of her husband, ZA, and passes it %0ato the lower ones— the souls in the worlds BYA. %0a%0aNukva 's state of Katnut is called "a rose among thorns," for nine of her lower %0aSefirot in the Katnut state fell under the Parsa of the world of Atzilut, thereby %0alosing the Light of the world of Atzilut, and becoming as dry as thorns. And in %0aher Gadlut state, Nukva is simply called "a rose" or "the Assembly of Israel." This %0ais why it is written, "there is a rose, and there is a rose." %0a%0aThe color red designates the rose's connection with the outer, impure forces, %0awhich, because of this connection, can suck the strength (Light) from it. This is %0abecause nine of her Sefirot are in exile below the world of Atzilut, in the world %0aof Beria, which may already contain impure forces. And the rose also has a color %0awhite in its Sefira Keter, for her Sefira Keter is in the world of Atzilut, above the %0aParsa, where there is no contact with the lower, impure forces. In other words, %0athere are two opposite states: perfection and its absence, Light and darkness. %0aThey are felt by him who merits it. %0a%0a%0a%0a58 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aIt is therefore written that just as a rose among thorns is tinged with red %0aand white, so does the Assembly of Israel consist of judgment and mercy. This %0ashows that in Gadlut, when Malchut is called Knesset Israel, even though she %0aascended to Bina and clothed her, she still retains the property of judgment, of %0arestriction— an attitude that's tough and just, rather than compassionate. This %0ais so because she needs a screen (a force of resistance to her egoistic desires), %0awhich, if available, enables Malchut to receive the Upper Light. %0a%0aThe law, judgment, or restriction does not allow for the reception of Light %0ain egoistic desires. The screen, the aspiration to oppose one's egoistic desires, %0arepels the Upper Light (pleasure) back to its source, the Creator. The Light that %0aman sends back is called "Returning Light" or the "Light of Judgment." To %0athe extent of the intensity of the reflective force (i.e., the force of resistance to %0aone's will to receive), man is allowed to receive the ten Sefirot of the Upper Light %0a(called the Direct Light or the Light of Mercy) for the Creator's sake, in precisely %0athese altruistic desires. And that is why, even in its complete state, the Assembly %0aof Israel consists of judgment and mercy, which corresponds to the red and %0awhite colors of a rose among thorns. %0a%0aAnd this is the pool made by King Shlomo (Solomon). It is built on twelve %0abulls, for the nine lower Sefirot of Malchut that fell to the world of Beria were %0acorrected there from twelve heads of bulls. One of their Sefirot, Keter, which %0aremained in the world of Atzilut, is called the "pool" that is built on these bulls. %0aTogether, they are called thirteen rose petals. (The reason why the ten Sefirot of %0aMalchut are divided by ten-Hassadim or thirteen-Hochma will be clarified later). %0a%0aThe Light of a complete Nukva is called Hochma, as it contains the Light of %0aWisdom, and originates from the thirteen names called "the thirteen attributes %0aof mercy." However, the main thing that Rabbi Hizkiyah wants to tell us is that %0aa rose among thorns is above the Assembly of Israel, because, as is well known, %0aall that is present in Nukva's complete state must exist in her small state as well, %0aalbeit in diminished similarity. %0a%0aTherefore, it is said that the properties of white and red in the small state %0acorrespond to the properties of mercy and judgment in the big state. And the %0athirteen petals of the small state, when corrected, create in Nukva the thirteen %0aattributes of mercy in her big state. Later on, we will see how these thirteen %0aattributes of Malchut of the world of Atzilut change her in both the small and %0abig states. %0a%0aIt is written that, in the process of creation, "in the beginning Elokim (Bina %0ade Atzilut) created" Nukva of ZA with thirteen words: ET, SHAMAJM, VE'ET, %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Rose %0a%0a%0a%0a59 %0a%0a%0a%0aARETZ, VEARETZ, HAITA, TOHL7, VABOHU, VECHOSHECH, AL, PNEI, %0aTEHOM, VERLACH (from the word Elokim to the word Elokim). And these %0athirteen words signify the thirteen petals of a rose among thorns (her small %0astate), like the pool built by the King Shlomo, which stands on thirteen (twelve) %0abulls (nine lower Sefirot of Malchut without Light, as they are in the world of %0aBeria, below the Parsa of the world of Atzilut). These words are the preparation %0afor the purification and correction of the Assembly of Israel in order to receive %0athe thirteen attributes of mercy. %0a%0aThese thirteen attributes of mercy (the Light of a complete Nukva) surround %0aher and shine upon her from all sides, and guard her from the touch of foreign %0a(egoistic) desires. After all, until she is filled with all the Light of Hochma in her %0acomplete, big state, there's a potential for foreign, egoistic desires to cling to and %0afeed off her. %0a%0a2. Afterwards, the name Elokim is mentioned once more, "Elokim soars." %0aWhy is it mentioned in this sense? So as to bring out the five rigid leaves that %0asurround the rose, which are called "salvation." And these are the five gates. %0aAnd it is said of this secret, I will raise the "cup of salvation" (Psalms, 116:13). %0aIt is the cup of blessing. The cup of blessing must rest on five fingers, just as a %0arose rests on five rigid leaves that correspond to the five fingers. And this rose is %0athe cup of blessing, from the second to the third mention of the name Elokim %0a(Beresheet, 1:2-3), there are five words: "soars," "over," "the surface," "of the %0awaters," "and said"— in all, five words parallel the five leaves. And further, %0a"The Creator said, 'Let there be Light'"— this Light was created. However, it %0awas concealed and enclosed within that covenant that entered the rose and %0afructified it. And it is referred to as "A fructiferous tree, wherein is the seed %0athereof" (Beresheet, 1:12). And this seed exists in the mark of the covenant. %0a%0aThe five leaves are the five Sefirot of the Light reflected from Malchut, which %0ashe raises from the Zivug de Hakaa. The direct incoming Light is called five %0aHassadim HGT-NH, and it clothes into five parts (types of restrictions) of the %0aReturning Light HGT-NH, called the five rigid leaves of a rose, which correspond %0ato the text from the second (the spirit of God soared over the waters) to the third %0a(and said) mention of the word Elokim in the Torah. %0a%0aThese words explain how the five rigid leaves (attributes) can be extracted %0afrom Malchut so that she will be fit for a Zivug and achieve the big state. And %0aduring the big state, when the five rigid leaves become five restrictions, they %0aare defined as the five gates of reception of the Light of Hassadim of the Direct %0aLight, and they are called salvation, and Malchut is called the cup of salvation or %0a%0a%0a%0a60 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0athe cup of blessing and good fortune, for, thanks to these leaves (restrictions), %0aMalchut can receive the Light of Hassadim— a blessing. %0a%0aThe cup of blessing must rest on five fingers, for Malchut can receive the Light %0aof Hochma only if she is clothed in the Light of Hassadim beforehand. Therefore, %0afirst she has to make a blessing, which means to receive the five parts (NRNHY) %0aof the Light of Hassadim with the help of five fingers (five restrictions), and only %0athen to receive in them (i.e., in the corrected intentions) the Light of Hochma. %0a%0aHence, a cup of wine must be raised with two hands, as five fingers of %0athe right hand symbolize mercy— Hassadim, and five fingers of the left hand %0asymbolize restrictions. However, having started the blessing, the cup must only %0abe held with the five fingers of the right hand (Hassadim, bestowing). Otherwise, %0athe impure forces that take from the left (receiving) side become active, as such %0aforces cling only to a place where there is reception of Light. %0a%0aWhat follows is the big state of Malchut, which corresponds to the words %0aof the To rah: "Let there be Light." These are the five lights, in which Adam %0asaw the world from end to end, as it is written in the Talmud (Hagigah, 12). %0aBut the Creator saw that there would be transgressions in the generations of %0athe Flood and the Tower of Babel, and concealed this Light. And the following %0agenerations will then need to attain it on their own. %0a%0aPreviously, these five Hassadim were in Yesod of ZA, and Malchut received %0afrom it, and not from Bina, called Elokim, as she does now. Yesod de ZA is %0acalled the mark of the covenant with the Creator (after the corrections, called %0acircumcision, are made), and five Hassadim received on the five restrictions are %0acalled "seed." The main force of restrictions and the impact forces of the screen, %0awith which it repels the Light, are in Ateret Yesod (the end of the Sefira Yesod). %0aThere occurs Zivug de Hakaa, from which Malchut receives the Light. Only at the %0aend of correction will this Zivug pass on to Malchut herself. %0a%0aTherefore, during the 6,000 years, the screen that is in Yesod, strikes at %0athe incoming Light (pleasure) with its five restrictions (the forces that oppose %0aegoistic reception of pleasure), thus creating five parts of the Returning Light, %0aand receiving in them the five parts of the Light of Hassadim. Subsequently, %0aZA passes these five Lights of Hassadim from his Yesod to Nukva. And these five %0aLights of Hassadim are called "seed." %0a%0a3. Just as the covenant is conceived from that seed in forty-two Zivugim, %0aso the secret name fills and inseminates all forty-two letters of the initial %0aact of creation. %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Rose %0a%0a%0a%0a61 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe name "forty-two" = MB = Mem + Bet = 40 + 2 is composed of HaVaYaH %0a(four letters), filled HaVaYaH (ten letters), and doubly filled HaVaYaH (twenty- %0aeight letters). In all, 4 + 10 + 28 = 42, signifying the seed that exists in the mark %0aof the covenant that is enclosed in five Hassadim and five Gevurot. %0a%0aThere are two aspects to Nukva: her body (Partzuf), which emerges from Bina, %0aand her Zivug, called the secret of unity with ZA. Nukva can be in two states: %0asmall or big (Katnut or Gadlut respectively). The small state is an incomplete, %0ainsufficient state of Malchut, but it is necessary as preparation for the big state, %0acalled the revelation of the secret, of the concealed. %0a%0aAnd since the big state reveals the small, and all that is concealed in the %0asmall state becomes clear in the big, he who is in a state of spiritual descent does %0anot see the reasons for his state, but it all becomes clear to him when he attains %0athe big state that follows. %0a%0aAs a result of the ascent of Malchut of AVI to their Bina, Partzuf of Bina (AVI) %0awas divided into two parts: the upper part, GE, acquired the name AVI, while %0athe lower part, AHP, became known as YESHSUT. AVI are filled with the Light %0aof Hassadim, since they wish for no other, and YESHSUT receives it from them, %0afor, although it desires the Light of Hochma, it cannot receive it in view of the %0afact that Malchut of AVI ascended above it. %0a%0aHowever, although there is no Light of Hochma in AVI, they do not suffer %0awithout it whatsoever, and therefore exist in perfection called GAR, even in the %0aabsence of the Light of Hochma. And even when one raises MAN requesting %0astrength (i.e., the Light of Hochma) so as to overcome his impure desires, AVI %0ado not receive the Light of Hochma. YESHSUT receives this Light and passes it %0ato ZA. Hence, although AVI are below the Rosh of AA, and there is no Light of %0aHochma in them, they do not suffer from it. %0a%0aHowever, YESHSUT suffers from the absence of the Light of Hochma, %0awishing to pass it to ZA, so it waits for MAN from ZA in order to ascend to AVI %0ain the form of Sefira Daat. For when the lower ones raise MAN, the whole of %0aBina ascends to the Rosh of AA; YESHSUT receives the Light of Hochma from %0aAA and passes it to ZON. This corresponds to the disappearance of the letter Yod %0afrom the word Avir (air), and Avir turns into Ohr— Light (Hochma) once more. %0a%0aHowever, for all that, even in the Rosh of AA, AVI remain only with the Light %0aof Hassadim (air). Hence, the heads of both AA and AVI are called "Supreme %0aWaters" or "Heaven." This is considering the fact that AVI can be beneath the %0aRosh of AA; however, since it does not affect their independence and perfection, %0ait is as if they are in the Rosh of AA. %0a%0a%0a%0a62 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aUnder AVI there is a firmament (Parsa) of the world of Atzilut, which %0aseparates the Kelim of bestowal from the Kelim of reception of the world of %0aAtzilut. YESHSUT and ZON (inferior waters) that need the Light of Hochma %0astand below the Parsa, which is in the chest of AA. It is therefore said that %0athe inferior waters weep (i.e., their state is small), for they feel the lack of Ohr %0aHochma and wish to ascend to the Rosh of AA. In no way should one confuse %0athe Parsa of the world of Atzilut (located within the world of Atzilut) that divides %0ait into GE and AHP with the Parsa below the world Atzilut that separates it from %0athe worlds of BYA. %0a%0aThe Light that is received above the Parsa of the world of Atzilut is called the %0aLight of Mem-Bet (MB). However, the seven Sefirot of ZON (six Sefirot of ZA and %0aone Sefira of Malchut) that designate the seven days of creation cannot receive %0athis Light of MB, as they are located below the Parsa and receive only the Light %0aof Hassadim (minimal sustenance) from YESHSUT. %0a%0aHowever, when the lower ones (man) raise MAN, and MAD descends from %0aAB-SAG (the Light that brings Bina back to the Rosh of AA), YESHSUT receives %0athe Light of Hochma and passes it to ZON, allowing ZON to ascend above the %0aParsa that stands in the Chazeh (chest) of AA, and receive the Light of MB. %0a%0aThat is why the Light of MB in ZON is manifested in thirty-two Elokim and %0aten sayings, where thirty-two Elokim represent YESHSUT in the state of ascent, %0awhen YESHSUT receives thirty-two streams of wisdom (Hochma) that create in %0ait the thirty-two names of Elokim, mentioned in the act of creation: "In the %0abeginning the Creator created," and so on. %0a%0aThe ten sayings are five Hassadim. After ZON have already received the %0aLight of Hochma from thirty-two Elokim, the five Lights of Hassadim that were %0areceived from AVI (signifying MB) are called "Supreme Waters." We see that the %0afive Hassadim in ZON do not turn into the name MB before they receive from %0athirty-two Elokim. It is therefore said that thirty-two Elokim and ten sayings form %0athe name MB, i.e., in the state of ascent. %0a%0aHence, Rabbi Hizkiyah said that the five Lights in the saying "Let there be %0aLight" (signifying the five Hassadim) are called "seed" (abundance), which Yesod %0aof ZA passes to Malchut. And it is called MB, although essentially it is merely %0afive Hassadim; however, since it has the Light of Hochma that was received from %0athirty-two Elokim of YESHSUT, it refers to MB.

diff:1688306592:1688306592:=1,1836d0%0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c LITERAL TRANSLATION OF THE %0a%3c AFORECITED TEXT FROM ARAMAIC %0a%3c INTO ENGLISH 3 %0a%3c %0a%3c 1. Rabbi Hizkiyah opened, "It is written, as a rose among thorns." That a rose is %0a%3c the Assembly of Israel. Because there is a rose and there is a rose, just as a rose %0a%3c among thorns is tinged with red and white, the Assembly of Israel consists of %0a%3c judgment and mercy. Just as a rose has thirteen petals, the Assembly of Israel %0a%3c is surrounded on all sides by the thirteen attributes of mercy. However, Elokim, %0a%3c that is here, thought to bring out the thirteen words that surround the Assembly %0a%3c of Israel and guard it. %0a%3c %0a%3c 2. Afterwards, this is mentioned another time. The reason it is mentioned %0a%3c another time is to bring out the five rigid leaves that surround the rose. And %0a%3c these five stand for salvation. These are also the five gates. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is written of this secret, "I will raise the cup of salvation, it is the cup %0a%3c of blessing." The cup of blessing must rest on five fingers, and no more, just %0a%3c as a rose rests on five rigid leaves that correspond to the five fingers. And this %0a%3c rose is the cup of blessing. From the second to the third mention of the name %0a%3c Elokim, there are five words. From here on, the Light was created and concealed, %0a%3c enclosed within that covenant, and entered the rose and fructified it. And this is %0a%3c referred to as a fructiferous tree, wherein is the seed thereof. And this seed truly %0a%3c exists in the letter of the covenant. %0a%3c %0a%3c 3. And just as the form of the covenant is sown in forty-two conceptions from %0a%3c that seed, so is the legislative, special name of creation sown. %0a%3c %0a%3c 4. In the beginning, Rabbi Shimon opened, the flower buds appeared on the %0a%3c earth. "The flower buds" refer to the act of creation. They appeared on the %0a%3c earth when, on the third day, as it is said, "And the earth shall pullulate." %0a%3c That was when they appeared on the earth. The time of singing has come, and %0a%3c this is the fourth day, when there was a reduction from the Light of Hassadim. %0a%3c The voice of the turtle dove refers to the fifth day, where it is written, "Let the %0a%3c waters swarm," so as to produce offspring. "It is heard" refers to the sixth day, %0a%3c where it is written, "Let us stand and create man," and there it is said, "We %0a%3c will do and we will hear." "In our land" refers to the day of Shabbat, which %0a%3c represents the Land of Life. %0a%3c %0a%3c 5. Another meaning is that these flower buds are the Patriarchs who entered the %0a%3c thoughts of the future world, and there they are concealed. They emerged from %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 3 The translation in the book is semantic and not literal %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c An Example of the Original Text of The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 37 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c there in concealment, and concealed themselves in the true prophets. Yosef was %0a%3c born and they concealed themselves in him. When Yosef entered the Holy Land %0a%3c and founded them there, they appeared in the land (earth) and were revealed %0a%3c there. When are they seen? When a rainbow is seen in the world. It is when the %0a%3c rainbow is seen that they are revealed. As the time of pruning has come. The %0a%3c time has come to eradicate the wicked from the world. Why were the wicked %0a%3c saved? Because the flower buds can be seen in the earth. And if they could not %0a%3c be seen, they would not have remained in the world, and the world would not %0a%3c be able to exist. %0a%3c %0a%3c 6. Who animates the world and causes the Fathers to appear? It is the voice of %0a%3c the children, who study the Torah, meaning that these children of the world %0a%3c save the world. In deference to them, "We will make you pendants of gold." %0a%3c Those are the children, children of the world, as is it said, "You shall make two %0a%3c Cherubs of gold." %0a%3c %0a%3c 7. In the beginning, Rabbi Elazar opened, "Raise your eyes above and see who %0a%3c has created this." Raise your eyes. To what place? To the place where all eyes %0a%3c depend on Him. And who is He? He is one who opens eyes. And you will know %0a%3c this. It is the concealed Atik, wherein lies the question, who has created this. %0a%3c And who is He? MI = who. He is called from the edge of Divine Heaven, where %0a%3c everything belongs to Him. As there is a question, He is along a concealed path, %0a%3c and does not reveal Himself. He is called MI, as there is no question Above, this %0a%3c edge of Heaven is called MI. %0a%3c %0a%3c 8. And there is another below, called MA. What is between this and that? The %0a%3c first one, called MI, is concealed. There is a question in him, because man asks, %0a%3c searches and looks, and beholds from degree to degree until the end of all the %0a%3c degrees. And after he arrives there, he is asked: MA? (What?). What have you %0a%3c learned? What have you seen? What have you investigated, since everything is %0a%3c still concealed, just as it was before. %0a%3c %0a%3c 9. It is written of this secret, "Who can I point out to you? Who can I compare %0a%3c you to?" After all, the Temple was destroyed, and a voice came forth and said, %0a%3c "What can I point out to you, and what can I compare you to?" The word MA = %0a%3c what, testimony, each day and the day of testimony to you from the days of past, %0a%3c as it is written: "I call to witness Heaven and earth," which is like unto you. %0a%3c %0a%3c According to the same type, "I adorned you with holy ornaments," made %0a%3c you ruler over the world, as it is written: "Is this the city that was called the %0a%3c quintessence of beauty?" and so forth. I have called you, "Jerusalem, a city built %0a%3c by me." "What could be compared to you?" Just as you sit, so he is like Above, %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 38 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c just as now the holy nation does not enter into you to perform holy work, so %0a%3c I swear to you that I will not enter Above until I dwell down below. This is %0a%3c your consolation, as this degree is equal to you in all things. And now that I %0a%3c am here, "Your misery is great, like the sea." And if you claim that there is no %0a%3c existence or remedy for you, then MI (who) shall heal you? It shall be precisely %0a%3c that concealed Supernal Degree, which animates all things; it shall heal you, %0a%3c and exist within you. %0a%3c %0a%3c 10. MI is the upper edge of Heaven, MA is the lower edge of Heaven. This was %0a%3c inherited by Yaakov, that he shines from edge to edge, from the first edge, which %0a%3c is MI, until the last edge, which is MA, for he stands in the middle. Therefore, %0a%3c who has created this? %0a%3c %0a%3c 11. Rabbi Shimon said: Elazar, my son, stop talking and reveal to us the supernal %0a%3c secret, which the people of the world know nothing of. Rabbi Elazar was silent. %0a%3c Rabbi Shimon wept and said: One minute. Rabbi Shimon said: Elazar, what %0a%3c is ELEH (these)? If you say the stars and the signs of the zodiac, have they not %0a%3c always been seen? However, MA (what) were created, as it is said, by the word of %0a%3c the Creator were the Heavens made. If it is about concealed things, then it is not %0a%3c written ELEH, because they are revealed. %0a%3c %0a%3c 12. But this secret was never revealed, until one day when I was at the seashore, %0a%3c Eliyahu came and told me: "Rabbi, do you know what this is, WHO HAS %0a%3c CREATED THIS?" I told him: "These are the Heavens and their hosts, the %0a%3c works of the Creator, that man can look at them and bless them, as is written, %0a%3c 'When I behold Your Heavens, the work of Your hands, our Master, how glorious %0a%3c Your name is throughout all the earth'!" %0a%3c %0a%3c 13. He told me: "Rabbi, there was one thing concealed before the Creator, %0a%3c which He revealed to the Supernal Assembly, and it is this. When the concealed %0a%3c of all the concealed desired to reveal Himself, He first made one single point, %0a%3c and this point ascended and became a Thought. With it, He drew all the forms %0a%3c and with it engraved all the images." %0a%3c %0a%3c 14. He engraved inside a concealed, sacred candle an image of a concealed %0a%3c image of the holy of holies. A profound structure emerged from the depth of %0a%3c that thought, and it is called MI - who, which is the inception of the structure %0a%3c both standing and not standing, which is hidden deep inside the name. It is not %0a%3c called, but only MI - who. He desired to reveal Himself and to be called this %0a%3c name, so He clothed Himself in a precious, radiant garment and created ELEH, %0a%3c and ELEH ascended in name. These letters combined with these, and the name %0a%3c Elokim was completed. And until He created ELEH - this, Elokim did not ascend %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c An Example of the Original Text of The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 39 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c to form the name Elokim. And these sinned in worshipping the golden calf. Of %0a%3c this secret it is said, ELEH is your Lord, Israel. %0a%3c %0a%3c 15. Just as the letters MI joined the letters ELEH, so does this name remain %0a%3c forever united, and on this secret stands the world. Eliyahu then flew away, and %0a%3c I could not see him. It is from him that I knew this, which stands on the secret, %0a%3c and its explanation. Rabbi Elazar has come, and all the disciples, too, and they %0a%3c bowed down before him, wept and said, if we had (not) come into this world but %0a%3c only to hear this secret, it would have been enough. %0a%3c %0a%3c 16. Rabbi Shimon said, "Onto these Heavens and their hosts were created in %0a%3c MA, as it is said, 'When I behold the Heavens, the works of Your hands,' and it %0a%3c is said, 'MA, how glorious Your name is throughout all the earth, which You set %0a%3c Above the Heavens, it ascends in name.' That is why it created Light for Light, %0a%3c clothed this into this, and elevated in the Supernal Name, this the Creator %0a%3c created in the beginning. This is the Supernal Creator, for MA is not such and %0a%3c was not created." %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Rose %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 1. Rabbi Hizkiyah opened (began): "It is said, as a rose among thorns" (Shir %0a%3c HaShirim, 2:2). He asks, "What does a rose represent?" He answers, "It is the %0a%3c Assembly of Israel, meaning Malchut. For there is a rose, and there is a rose. %0a%3c Just as a rose among thorns is tinged with red and white, so does the Assembly %0a%3c of Israel (Malchut) consist of judgment and mercy. Just as a rose has thirteen %0a%3c petals, so the Assembly of Israel consists of thirteen properties of mercy, %0a%3c surrounding it on all sides. After all, Elokim (the name of the Creator that %0a%3c alludes to His attitude towards the lower ones by the force of judgment), as %0a%3c it is said, 'In the beginning, Elokim created' (the first sentence in the Torah), %0a%3c In the beginning (initially) when He thought it, He created thirteen words to %0a%3c surround the Assembly of Israel and to protect it, and here they are: THE, %0a%3c HEAVEN, ANDTHE, EARTH, ANDTHE EARTH, WAS, EMPTY, AND- %0a%3c CHAOTIC, ANDTHE DARKNESS, OVER, THE FACE, OF THE ABYSS, %0a%3c ANDTHE SPIRIT, up to the word Elokim" (In Hebrew, "and" is written in %0a%3c conjunction with the word following it. Hence, it is considered as one word). %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c its object of study, Kabbalah takes the only creation, the only thing that %0a%3c %0a%3c creaks %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c As its %0a%3c %0a%3c exists besides the Creator— man's self, or "I," and researches it. This science br %0a%3c down the self into parts, explains the structure and properties of each part, and %0a%3c the purpose of its creation. Kabbalah explains how every part of man's self, called %0a%3c "the soul," can be changed so that one would reach the goal of creation, the state %0a%3c desired by both the Creator and man himself, provided he realizes it. %0a%3c %0a%3c There is not a science in the world that can describe, either graphically or %0a%3c nalytically, through use of formulas, our sensations and desires, and how diverse %0a%3c nd multifaceted they are. That is how fickle, unpredictable, and absolutely %0a%3c listinct they are in everyone. This is because our desires surface in our mind %0a%3c nd sensations in a gradual order, in a certain sequence, so we may acknowledge %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 41 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 42 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c is our essence, the only thing that characterizes an indi\ %0a%3c ging, and what remains is merely an external, ar %0a%3c hy it is said that every moment man is born anew. Yet, if thi; %0a%3c )Uid we regard one another, and how should we perceive ourselves? How %0a%3c possibly "stabilize" anything within and outside of us if we are constantly %0a%3c >ing, and all that we perceive is a function of our inner state? %0a%3c %0a%3c The Creator is the source of Light (pleasure). Those who draw near Him %0a%3c sense Him as such. Such people, who draw near the Creator and thereby sense %0a%3c Him, are called Kabbalists (from the word Lekabel— to receive the Creator's %0a%3c Light). One can draw near the Creator only through equivalence of desires. %0a%3c ;ator is incorporeal, and can only be sensed with our heart. Naturall 1 %0a%3c leant by "heart" is not the pump that mobilizes blood through our vei %0a%3c ter of man's every sensation. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, one cannot sense the Creator with just his heart, but only with %0a%3c small point in it. And to feel this point, man must develop it himself. When %0a%3c one develops and expands this point, the sensation of the Creator, His Light, %0a%3c can enter it. %0a%3c %0a%3c Our heart is the sum of our egoistic desires, and the small point within it %0a%3c is part of the spiritual, altruistic desire implanted from Above by the Creator %0a%3c Himself. It is our task to nurture this embryo of a spiritual desire to such an %0a%3c ;nt that it (and not our egoistic nature) will determine all of our aspiratior %0a%3c re time, the egoistic desire of the heart will surrender, contract, ' %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c lg born in our world, one is obliged to change his hear %0a%3c egoistic to altruistic, while living in this world. This is the purpose of %0a%3c the reason behind his appearance in this world, and it is the goal of all creation. %0a%3c A complete replacement of egoistic desires with altruistic ones is called "the %0a%3c End of Correction." Every individual and all of humanity must attain it in this %0a%3c world together. Until one achieves this, he will continue to be born into this %0a%3c rid. The Torah and all the prophets speak exclusively of this. The methoc %0a%3c tion is called "Kabbalah." %0a%3c %0a%3c >ne can change his desires only i %0a%3c solute egoist; he can neither ac %0a%3c from the surrounding world— as his surroundings are just like him— nor does he %0a%3c have any link to the spiritual worlds, since such a link is possible only throu£ %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Rose %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 43 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ence, an individual in our world has no chance of transcending %0a%3c ies of this world on his own. That is why we were given the To %0a%3c ost effective part, Kabbalah— to help man acquire the desires of %0a%3c orlds. %0a%3c %0a%3c In order to create man in remoteness to Himself, so that man would realize %0a%3c his insignificance and would come independently to the desire to ascend, the %0a%3c Creator created all creation as degrees descending from Him. The Creator's %0a%3c Light descended along these degrees, and at the lowest degree, created our world %0a%3c and man in it. Having realized his insignificance and wishing to ascend to the %0a%3c reator, man (to the extent that he wishes to approach the Creator) ascends %0a%3c the same degrees by which his initial descent took place. %0a%3c %0a%3c In all, there are ten degrees, called "ten Sefirot": Keter, Hochma, Bina, Hesed, %0a%3c Gevura, Tifferet, Netzah, Hod, Yesod, and Malchut. Like ten screens or curtains, %0a%3c these ten Sefirot conceal the Creator's Light from us or the Creator Himself %0a%3c (which is the same thing). These ten screens constitute the ten degrees of our %0a%3c remoteness from the Creator. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, in order to draw near the Creator by one degree, the lowest %0a%3c one above our own properties, we must acquire the properties of that (lowest) %0a%3c degree. This means that our properties become similar to the properties of that %0a%3c degree, rather than remaining inferior to it. To acquire similar properties means %0a%3c to have the same desires. As soon as our desires coincide with the desires of %0a%3c that degree, its concealment fades, and we seemingly exist on it, and only nine %0a%3c degrees separate us from the Creator. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, the last, lowest degree differs from all the others: as soon as one %0a%3c ascends out of our world and onto the first degree, he already begins to see %0a%3c (sense) the Creator. And all the subsequent degrees are degrees of drawing closer %0a%3c to the Creator. Only the very last degree, at which we presently exist, conceals %0a%3c the Creator completely, whereas all of the Higher Degrees only distance Him. %0a%3c %0a%3c Although we count ten degrees, there are in fact only five of them. This is %0a%3c because six degrees: Hesed, Gevura, Tifferet, Netzah, Hod, and Yesod combine into %0a%3c one Sefira, called ZeirAnpin (ZA). ZA itself is sometimes referred to as Tifferet, for %0a%3c this Sefira reflects the common attributes of all of its six Sefirot. %0a%3c %0a%3c So, there are five degrees of concealment from the Creator down to our %0a%3c world: Keter, Hochma, Bina, ZA, and Malchut. Every degree is alternatively called %0a%3c Olam (world), from the word Haalamah (concealment). Every degree has its sub- %0a%3c degrees, called Partzufim (plural for Partzuf), and every sub-degree has its own %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 44 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c sub-degrees, called Sefirot (plural for Sefira). Thus, in all, 5x5x5 = 125 degrees- %0a%3c Sefirot exist between us and the Creator. %0a%3c %0a%3c Below is a table of the degrees from the Creator down to our world: %0a%3c %0a%3c The Creator: an absolutely altruistic desire to create a soul (man) in order %0a%3c to fill it with delight. %0a%3c %0a%3c The world of Infinity: the existence of souls in the ultimate, perfect state. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c WORLDS %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c SEFIROT %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c PARTZUFIM %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Keter %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Galaalta %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 1 st World %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Hochma %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c AB %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ( * ) %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Adam Kadmon %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Bina %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ( * ) %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c (AK) %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ZA %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c MA %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BON %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ( * ) %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Keter %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Arirh Annin (AA\ %0a%3c %0a%3c r\\ iv/i i r\\ \vj\\ \ %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ?nd Wnrlrl %0a%3c %0a%3c L.

Because desire in the spiritual %0a%3c signates action, desire itself acts, without a body. Therefore, when the desire %0a%3c create souls (the will to enjoy) appeared in the Creator, when He wished %0a%3c fill them with the most perfect delight— to sense Him and to delight in His %0a%3c perfection— to make creatures just as He is, His desire was immediately realized. %0a%3c Thus appeared the World of Ein Sof, in which we already exist in our final state. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, we still need to attain this state in our sensations. This is %0a%3c reminiscent of a sleeping person: even though he is sleeping somewhere, he %0a%3c does not understand where he is until he wakes up. However, in order to achieve %0a%3c is perfect state, we must go through a gradual process of transformation of our %0a%3c ner properties (desires), which corresponds to the spiritual ascension fror %0a%3c r world through all the worlds, to the World of Ein Sof. %0a%3c %0a%3c lead us to the final state, the Creator governs us from Above thrc %0a%3c all the worlds. Thus, there is nothing in our world that does not originate in %0a%3c the World of Ein Sof, where the final state of every soul determines the path %0a%3c that it is destined to travel in general and the changes that it has to undergo %0a%3c in particular at every moment (state) of its spiritual advancement towards the %0a%3c World of Infinity. %0a%3c %0a%3c There is no way back: everything that happens is dictated by the necessity to %0a%3c ing every soul to its final state. Only this goal determines the state of our worl %0a%3c ery second, what happens to it in general and to each of us in particular. ' %0a%3c created nothing for naught. Rather, everything serves His purpose. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, the will that stems from Above does not exclude our ac %0a%3c articipation in our own advancement. Instead of being slaves that move %0a%3c under the compulsion of a beating stick called suffering, we can turn our path %0a%3c of suffering into the path of Torah— to actively and quickly travel this path %0a%3c from below upwards on our own by realizing that the Creator's purpose is %0a%3c indeed desirable. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is possible via a request for spiritual elevation— raising MAN, a prayer, %0a%3c response, we will receive spiritual strength from Above that will help us %0a%3c our qualities, i.e., to ascend. The entire Torah speaks only of this, and %0a%3c goes further still and provides a detailed explanation of the path itself, %0a%3c if on a map, it depicts what we go through and where (in what state and at %0a%3c :h degree) we are now. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 46 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Kabbalah studies the structure of the spiritual worlds. The purpose of these %0a%3c worlds is to weaken the Creator's signals (desires) so that we could understand %0a%3c them with our egoism and realize them with our mind. In Hebrew, the word %0a%3c for "world" is Olam (from the word Haalamah— meaning concealment), for %0a%3c these worlds conceal and weaken the Creator's Light to such an extent that %0a%3c we can feel it. %0a%3c %0a%3c Depending on everyone's spiritual qualities, on the degree of one's %0a%3c attainment (complete egoism = our world, partial altruism = spiritual worlds), %0a%3c we perceive the Creator or His Light differently at each of the 125 degrees. These %0a%3c 125 degrees amount to just ten, called "the ten Sefirot between the Creator and %0a%3c us," where every lower Sefira transmits less of the Creator's Light, as perceived %0a%3c by those at that degree. The lower the Sefira, the less of the Creator's Light it lets %0a%3c through to those that are below it. %0a%3c %0a%3c SEFIROT %0a%3c %0a%3c These are the names of the Sefirot: Keter, Hochma, Bina, Hesed, Gevura, Tifferet, %0a%3c Netzah, Hod, Yesod, and Makhut. However, six of them are combined into one %0a%3c Sefira, called Zeir Anpin, so in all there are five Sefirot: Keter, Hochma, Bina, %0a%3c ZA, and Malchut. Also, ZA himself (ZA is usually considered a male Sefira) is %0a%3c sometimes called Tifferet, since Tifferet is his main Sefira, absorbing within itself %0a%3c the properties of all six Sefirot of ZA. Thus, the Creator created only five Sefirot: %0a%3c %0a%3c Keter— the Creator's desire to bestow delight upon us, Malchut; %0a%3c %0a%3c Hochma— the pleasure itself, which the Creator wishes to bestow upon us; %0a%3c %0a%3c Bina— passes the pleasure from Hochma to ZA; %0a%3c %0a%3c ZA— accepts the pleasure from Bina and passes it to Malchut; %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut— receives the pleasure. %0a%3c %0a%3c Bina consists of two parts: her upper part, called GAR or AVI, is unwilling %0a%3c to receive the Light from Hochma. However, since the Creator wishes to impart %0a%3c this Light to the lower ones, the lower part of Bina, called ZAT or YESHSL7T, %0a%3c receives the Light from Hochma and passes it to ZA. ZA does not want to receive %0a%3c the Light, but Malchut (to the extent of her correction) evokes ZA to receive %0a%3c the Light from Bina and pass it on to her. Hence, we sometimes speak of the %0a%3c general reception of the Light by ZA and Malchut, which are together called %0a%3c ZON (ZA and Nukva). %0a%3c %0a%3c The process is such that Malchut— to the extent that her desires are corrected %0a%3c from egoism to altruism— asks ZA to receive the Light "for the Creator's sake." %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Rose %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 47 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c To this extent, ZA requests the Light from Bina. Subsequently, Bina turns to %0a%3c and receives the requested amount of Light from Hochma, then passes it to %0a%3c ZA. Malchut (to the extent of her corrected properties) merges with ZA via %0a%3c equivalence of form (desires), and receives this Light. %0a%3c %0a%3c Keter, Hochma, and GAR of Bina do not want to receive the Light, but %0a%3c starting with ZAT of Bina (YESHS L7T), the desire to receive the Light so as to %0a%3c pass it to the lower ones appears in the Sefirot. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Keter %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Galgalta or Metzah - forehead %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c "bestowal" %0a%3c GE %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Hochma %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Eynaim - eyes %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c _.

This desire is to enjoy the Creator's Light or the Creator %0a%3c (which is the same thing) is the essence of Malchut. We are parts of Malchut. %0a%3c However, if we have only egoistic desires, we feel the Creator's Light as pleasures %0a%3c in our world. This is a micro dose of His Light. By correcting our desires %0a%3c (properties), we can ascend the spiritual degrees of the Upper Worlds, and there %0a%3c experience the Creator's true delight. %0a%3c %0a%3c According to the Thought of Creation, Malchut must receive the Light from %0a%3c the four previous Sefirot, and delight in it. Hence, Malchut herself consists of five %0a%3c parts: she receives the Light from the preceding Sefirot in four parts, and senses %0a%3c it in the fifth. %0a%3c %0a%3c All the Sefirot that precede Malchut (excluding Malchut) are similar to our %0a%3c sensory organs, and Malchut is like the heart that receives from all organs: brain, %0a%3c sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch. The heart is Malchut, and the sensory %0a%3c organs are the first nine Sefirot that precede Malchut. All of these parts of Malchut %0a%3c are egoistic— they wish to receive the Light (pleasure) so as to enjoy it. With such %0a%3c properties, Malchut cannot receive more than a micro dose of the Light of our %0a%3c world, sensing the Creator in a manner called "this world." %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 48 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c However, if Malchut, i.e., every one of us, were to receive desires (aspirations) %0a%3c from Above to bestow delight upon the Creator to the same extent that we feel %0a%3c the Creator bestowing upon us, with this property (desire), man would ascend %0a%3c spiritually to a degree above our world. He would sense the Creator as spiritual %0a%3c Light, altruistic pleasure and great knowledge, attainment of supernal thoughts %0a%3c and the essence of existence. %0a%3c %0a%3c SCREEN %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut (man) can receive the Light only in anti-egoistic desires. If such desires %0a%3c appear in Malchut as a result of the realization that egoism is her enemy (with %0a%3c the help of Kabbalah), to the extent of her hatred for it, Malchut can repel %0a%3c the egoistic pleasures for the sake of spiritual perfection, i.e., similarity to the %0a%3c Creator in her desire to please Him and act for His sake. %0a%3c %0a%3c This ability to repel selfish reception of pleasure is called "a screen," and %0a%3c the repelled pleasure is called "Returning Light," and the pleasure that comes to %0a%3c Malchut is called "Direct Light." It is precisely in the repelled pleasure, meaning %0a%3c in the desire to bestow whole-heartedly, selflessly, that man can sense the %0a%3c Creator's Light and Supreme Knowledge. %0a%3c %0a%3c Since Malchut (man's egoism) has to repel pleasure from the five parts of her %0a%3c egoism, the reflecting screen must also consist of five parts. Hence, it creates five %0a%3c parts of the Returning Light. The five parts in Malchut are called by the names %0a%3c of the Sefirot from which they receive. The five kinds of Direct Light are called %0a%3c NRNHY: Nefesh, Ruach, Neshama, Haya and Yechida. The Light that emanates %0a%3c from the Creator descends in the following order: %0a%3c %0a%3c Yechida %0a%3c %0a%3c Haya %0a%3c %0a%3c Neshama %0a%3c %0a%3c Ruach %0a%3c %0a%3c Nefesh %0a%3c %0a%3c PARTZUF %0a%3c %0a%3c After Malchut reflects the Light (pleasure), she decides to receive it in order to %0a%3c delight the Creator, because He wants Malchut to receive pleasure and feel Him. %0a%3c The reflection of all the incoming pleasure is called Rosh (head). The partial %0a%3c reception of the Light to the extent of one's anti-egoistic powers is called Toch %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Rose %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 49 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c (interior). The unfulfilled desires (due to the absence of a screen on them) are %0a%3c called So/ (end) (see below diagram). %0a%3c %0a%3c This is the structure of the soul (KU, vessel, corrected altruistic desire, Partzuf %0a%3c or spiritual body). We call the parts of the spiritual structure by the names of our %0a%3c physiological body: head, body, and limbs. There are five parts in the Rosh (head): %0a%3c skull— Galgalta, eyes— Eynairn, ears— Awznaim, nose— Hotem, and mouth— Peh. %0a%3c There are five parts in the Guf (body) from the mouth— Peh to the navel— Tabur. In %0a%3c the limbs, there are five parts from the navel to the toes (see below diagram). %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c / %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c OhrMakif %0a%3c (Surrounding Light) %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c \ %0a%3c %0a%3c OhrYashar * %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 50 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c THE INVERSE PROPORTION BETWEEN THE VESSEL %0a%3c AND THE LIGHT %0a%3c %0a%3c The more strength Malchut has to oppose egoism, the greater the Light that %0a%3c enters her. However, although one works on the correction of the vessel's coarser %0a%3c part, he receives the Light from his efforts in his subtler desires. In other words, %0a%3c there is an inverse proportion between the vessel and the Light: the coarser the %0a%3c desire (Kli) that is corrected, the greater the Light that enters Malchut (vessel); %0a%3c however, it enters her Upper Kli (desire). %0a%3c %0a%3c Since Malchut (i.e., all that exists apart from the Creator) is absolutely %0a%3c egoistic, she can only be corrected by imparting onto herself the properties of %0a%3c Bina, the Creator— bestowal without reception. This is the property of absolute %0a%3c altruism, of selfless bestowal. To receive such a property (desire) is tantamount %0a%3c to ascending from the level of Malchut to the level of Bina. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c SEFIRA %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c LIGHT %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Keter %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Hochma %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Bina %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ZA %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c If all parts of the Kli can %0a%3c receive the Light, then %0a%3c all the outside Light %0a%3c enters the Sefirot: %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c SEFIRA %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c LIGHT %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Keter %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Yechida %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Hochma %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Haya %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Bina %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Neshama %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ZA %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Ruach %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Nefesh %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut herself is the will to receive pleasure. The ban imposed on the %0a%3c reception of pleasure for oneself is called the First Restriction (Tzimtzum Aleph). %0a%3c Restriction is a ban on the reception of pleasure; however, if the receiver aspires %0a%3c to please the Creator and not himself, he is allowed to receive the pleasure. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Rose %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 51 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Whether Malchut wants it or not, if she (soul, man) has egoistic desires, the %0a%3c Light will not enter her (be felt within her). Hence, we are utterly unable to feel %0a%3c the spiritual (the Creator). %0a%3c %0a%3c THE STATE OF KATNUT (SMALLNESS) %0a%3c %0a%3c Yet, Malchut is not the only Sefira that cannot receive the Light: from the world %0a%3c of Atzilut and below, Sefirot Bina and ZA cannot receive the Light either. This %0a%3c ban is called the Second Restriction (T?imt?um Bet). In this restriction, Malchut %0a%3c seemingly ascends in her desires to Sefira Bina. Her desires of "reception" %0a%3c dominate three Sefirot: Bina, ZA, and Malchut, as Sefirot Bina and ZA also fall %0a%3c under the rule (desire) of the elevated Malchut. %0a%3c %0a%3c If a Partzuf has no strength to oppose its egoistic desires of reception in %0a%3c Sefirot Bina, ZA and Malchut (AHP), its lower part is not entitled to receive the %0a%3c Creator's Light, as it will receive it selfishly, thereby causing great harm to itself. %0a%3c To avoid this, the upper part of the Partzuf— Sefirot Keter and Hochma (GE)— %0a%3c separates from the lower part by Parsa (partition), through which the Light %0a%3c cannot pass downwards. Therefore, as a result of Malchut 's ascent to Bina, each %0a%3c degree was divided into two parts: %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Keter -Galgalta %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Hochma - Eynaim %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Together called Galgalta %0a%3c Eynaim (GE) %0a%3c %0a%3c Parsa = elevated Malchut — %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Bina - Awzen %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ZA-Hotem %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut - Peh %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Together called AHP %0a%3c (Awzen, Hotem, and Peh) %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut restricted the spreading of Light inside the Partzuf, and two parts %0a%3c were formed in her: GE receives the Light, i.e., Sefirot Keter and Hochma receive %0a%3c the Lights Ne/esh and Ruach, while the other part of the Partzuf (Sefirot Bina, %0a%3c ZA, and Malchut) is below the Parsa, and therefore does not receive the Light. %0a%3c Their corresponding Lights— Neshama, Ha^a and Yechida— also remain outside %0a%3c of the Partzuf. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 52 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c LIGHT %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c SEFIRA %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Yechida %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Haya %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Neshama %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Keter %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Ruach %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c GE %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Hochma %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Nefesh %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Bina %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c AHP %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ZA %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c This degree (Partzuf) is deprived of the Light Nesharna-Haya-Yechida and is left %0a%3c with just the Light Nefesh-Ruach, called "air." This is designated by the entry of %0a%3c the letter Yod into the word Light (Ohr = Aleph-Vav-Reish). Thus, the word Light %0a%3c (Ohr) turns into air (Avir = Aleph-Vav-Yod-Reish). This state of the vessel is called %0a%3c Katnut (small state). In other words, the ascent of Malchut to Bina is designated %0a%3c by the entry of the letter Yod into the word Light (Ohr = Aleph-Vav-Reish +Yod = %0a%3c Aleph-Vav-Yod-Reish = Avir— air). This means that because of Malchut's ascent to %0a%3c Bina, the Partzuf lost its Light and was left with air. %0a%3c %0a%3c In such a state, the degree or Partzuf is called Katnut (smallness), where %0a%3c Sefirot Keter and Hochma have only the Light Nefesh-Ruach, as Sefirot Bina, ZA and %0a%3c Malchut are below the Parsa, and do not receive the Light. The Parsa prevents %0a%3c the Light from spreading below it. Sefirot Keter-Hochma and Bina-ZA-Malchut are %0a%3c designated by the following letters: %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Keter %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c - Mem - %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c M %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Hochma %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c - Yod - %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 1 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Bina %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c - Hey - %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c H %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ZA %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c - Lamed - %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c LO %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c - Aleph - %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c E %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Rose %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 53 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c In the reverse order, these letters form the Creator's name Elokirn, where %0a%3c GE = letters Mem + Yod = IM (pronounced as MI), and AHP = letters Aleph + %0a%3c Lamed + Hey = ELEH. Since man attains the Creator from below upwards, the %0a%3c Creator's name ELOKIM is read from below upwards. %0a%3c %0a%3c After the birth of all the worlds and the descent of the entire Creation to %0a%3c our world, all the Partzufim of the world of Atzilut and the worlds of BYA passed %0a%3c into the state of Katnut. Thus, the Light is present in GE, but absent in AHP. %0a%3c AHP of the Upper Degree fell into GE of the lower degree, thus forming the %0a%3c spiritual ladder between the Creator and man in our world, and the lowest part %0a%3c of the last spiritual degree of the world of Assiya fell into a point in man's heart. %0a%3c Consequently, all the intermediate degrees now exist one inside the other: AHP %0a%3c of the Upper Degree is inside GE of the lower one: %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c THE CREATOR %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The descent of the Light from the Creator down to man in our world %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c THE WORLD OF AK %0a%3c , , The head of AA ("unattainable") is considered Infinity %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c K %0a%3c _H %0a%3c %0a%3c ZA %0a%3c M %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The world of Atzilut = GE and AHP fell into the world of Beria %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c K %0a%3c _H %0a%3c %0a%3c ~ B J %0a%3c %0a%3c ZA %0a%3c %0a%3c M %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The world of Beria = GE and AHP of the world of Atzilut %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c K %0a%3c _H %0a%3c %0a%3c ZA %0a%3c M %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The world of Yetzira = GE and AHP of the world of Beria %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c K %0a%3c _H %0a%3c %0a%3c ZA %0a%3c M %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The world of Assiya = GE and AHP of the world of Yetzira %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Our world = man's point in the heart, %0a%3c which contains AHP of the world of Assiya %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The sum of man's desires is referred to as his heart. Since the nature with %0a%3c which we are born is absolute egoism, man does not feel the spiritual point %0a%3c in his heart. However, at some point in one of his reincarnations, man begins %0a%3c to gradually strive towards attainment of the causes of life, its evaluation; he %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 54 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c yearns to attain himself, his source, just as you do right now. Man's aspiration %0a%3c to the Creator is precisely this aspiration to attain his origin. Man's discontent %0a%3c in life often helps him in this search, when there's nothing that appeals to him %0a%3c in his surroundings. Such circumstances are sent from Above in order for man %0a%3c to start feeling an empty point in his heart, and to stimulate in him the desire %0a%3c to fulfill it. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Creator manifests as the altruistic property to bestow pleasure without %0a%3c any benefit for Himself. From this, we can understand the property of Sefirot %0a%3c Keter, Hochma, and Bina that share the Creator's property of bestowal. The only %0a%3c Creation is Malchut, the will to receive the Light (pleasure). All of us and our %0a%3c entire world are the lowest part of this egoistic Malchut. %0a%3c %0a%3c THE STATE OF QADLUT (GREATNESS/ADULTHOOD) %0a%3c %0a%3c However, if one (Malchut) raises MAN, the request for his spiritual ascent, by %0a%3c making efforts to free himself from egoism and by praying to the Creator for %0a%3c help, the Light AB-SAG descends from Above. It comes from the world of AK, %0a%3c brings Malchut altruistic strength and enables her to return from Bina back to %0a%3c her place. In other words, Malchut's ability to refrain from selfish reception of %0a%3c pleasure is complemented with the strength to receive pleasure for the Creator's %0a%3c sake, to receive the Light of Hochma within AHP, for His sake. %0a%3c %0a%3c Subsequently, AHP, or Sefirot Bina, ZA and Malchut, become reactivated, the %0a%3c Partzuf regains all five Kelim (parts), the letter Yod disappears from the word Avir %0a%3c (air), and it turns to being Ohr (Light). In that state, all five Lights NRNHY fill %0a%3c the Partzuf, the letters MI join the letters ELEH, forming the Creator's name— %0a%3c Elokim. This state is called Gadlut (greatness/ adulthood). %0a%3c %0a%3c ASCENT OF THE LOWER ONE TO THE UPPER ONE %0a%3c %0a%3c As a result of Malchut's ascent to Bina, the Upper Partzuf establishes contact with %0a%3c the lower one. As a result, the lower Partzuf can ascend to the level of the Upper %0a%3c One. This is the reason for the second restriction: to give the lower ones (man) %0a%3c the opportunity to ascend to the World of Infinity, up to the Creator Himself. %0a%3c %0a%3c In order to establish this contact, the Upper Partzuf deliberately diminishes %0a%3c itself, descends to the level of the lower Partzuf, and becomes similar to the lower %0a%3c one in its properties. AHP of the Upper Partzuf willingly falls into GE of the %0a%3c lower one, as though it has no strength to receive the Light, and they become %0a%3c a single whole. This is similar to a scenario when a strong individual joins a %0a%3c society of criminals, imitating their behavior, so that after being admitted into %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Rose %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 55 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c their circle and establishing contact with them, he will gradually influence and %0a%3c correct them. %0a%3c %0a%3c How? The Upper Light (the so-called Light of AB-SAG) comes and provides %0a%3c AHP of the Upper Partzuf with the strength to ascend to their GE. And GE of the %0a%3c lower Partzuf ascend together with them: because they were a single whole and %0a%3c equivalent in their properties below, they receive the same strength to ascend. %0a%3c %0a%3c Upon receiving the Light of AB-SAG, GE of the lower Partzuf become %0a%3c like Upper One. Therefore, we should not regard the second restriction as %0a%3c negative, but as help from the Upper Partzuf. It descends to the lower Partzuf by %0a%3c corrupting its own properties in order to equalize itself with the lower one, so as %0a%3c to subsequently ascend together with it to its previous level. This way, the lowest %0a%3c degree can ascend not only to the next Higher One, but also to the Highest %0a%3c Degree of the spiritual ladder. %0a%3c %0a%3c THE LIGHT OF ZON IS THE LIGHT OF THE WORLDS BYA %0a%3c %0a%3c Partzuf YESHSUT is AHP of Partzuf Bina of the world of Atzilut, and all that it %0a%3c receives and passes to ZON of the world of Atzilut subsequently descends to the %0a%3c worlds of BYA and then to us. %0a%3c %0a%3c In the small state (Katnut), AHP of YESHSUT falls into ZON. Then %0a%3c YESHSUT receives strength, and by elevating its AHP, it elevates ZON, too. %0a%3c By ascending to YESHSUT, ZON become similar to it and receive the Light %0a%3c at the level of YESHSUT. ZON can never receive the Light of Hochma in their %0a%3c own level; they can only receive the Light of Hassadim, the Light essential to %0a%3c their existence. %0a%3c %0a%3c ZON of the world of Atzilut are called Olam (world), just as our world is also %0a%3c called Olam, for all that ZON de Atzilut receive can be received by man in this %0a%3c world. And vice versa— all that ZON de Atzilut cannot receive is unattainable to %0a%3c man, for we attain only up to the level of ZON, and not higher. %0a%3c %0a%3c And since ZON cannot receive the Light of Hochma in their place, the %0a%3c Creator purposely initiated the second restriction, thereby lowering the Sefirot %0a%3c of AHP of Partzuf YESHSUT down to ZON, so that ZON would be able to %0a%3c ascend to YESHSUT and higher, up to the Highest Degree. Hence, it is said %0a%3c in the Torah (Beresheet BaraK): "In the beginning the Creator created all in %0a%3c judgment (restriction), but after seeing that the world (ZON) cannot exist %0a%3c (receive all of the Light of Hochma prepared for it), added to judgment the %0a%3c property of mercy." %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 56 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c In the beginning, He elevated Malchut (the restriction of YESHSUT, for %0a%3c Malchut is restricted from receiving Light) to Bina (mercy of YESHSUT). As a %0a%3c result, AHP of YESHSUT fell into ZON and merged with them. However, the %0a%3c world (ZON) still cannot exist in this way. Hence, the Creator added mercy to %0a%3c judgment: He gave YESHSUT the strength to elevate its AHP together with ZON %0a%3c to the degree of YESHSUT. There, ZON receive the Light of YESHSUT and pass %0a%3c it down to all the worlds of BYA and to our world. %0a%3c %0a%3c CORRECTION IN THREE LINES %0a%3c %0a%3c Each of the ten Sefirot in turn consists of ten individual sub-Sefirot. Malchut %0a%3c ascends to Bina in each individual Sefira, i.e., to the full height of the ten %0a%3c Sefirot; in each particular Sefira, Malchut moves up from its place to the place %0a%3c of Bina in that Sefira: %0a%3c %0a%3c (M-ZA-|B-H-K)-K %0a%3c (M-ZA-|B-H-K)-H %0a%3c (M-ZA-|B-H-K)-B %0a%3c (M-ZA-|B-H-K)-ZA %0a%3c (M-ZA-I B-H-K)-M %0a%3c %0a%3c The sign | signifies a particular Parsa in a Sefira, the restriction imposed on %0a%3c the spreading of Light. GE that remain in each Sefira above the Parsa are called %0a%3c the "right line," for there is Light in them. Malchut that ascends to Bina in each %0a%3c Sefira creates the "left line" with her restriction on the reception of Light. A %0a%3c Zivug made on the elevated Malchut (only on the free, unrestricted Kelim KHB) %0a%3c allows the Light of Hassadim to shine in GE, and this reception of the Light of %0a%3c Hassadim in GE is called the "middle line." %0a%3c %0a%3c Now let us clarify what is written in The Zohar: There are ten Sefirot: Keter %0a%3c (K), Hochma (H), Bina (B), Hesed (H), Gevura (G), Tifferet (T), Netzah (N), Hod %0a%3c (H), Yesod (Y), and Malchut (M). However, there are actually only five of them: %0a%3c Keter (K), Hochma (H), Bina (B), Tifferet (T), and Malchut (M). This is because %0a%3c Tifferet (alternatively called Zeir An£>in— ZA) consists of six Sefirot, from Hesed to %0a%3c Yesod. Five Sefirot KHB-ZA-M created five Partzufim in each world. In the world %0a%3c of Atzilut, these Partzufim are Arich Anpin (AA), Aba ve Ima (AVI), and Zeir An£>in %0a%3c and Nukva (ZON). Keter is called AA; correspondingly, Hochma and Bina are %0a%3c called AVI; and ZA (Tifferet) and Malchut are called ZON. %0a%3c %0a%3c The essence of the seven days of creation lies in Partzufim ZA and Nukva of %0a%3c the world of Atzilut, which consist of seven Sefirot: HGT-NHYM. And from the %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Rose %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 57 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c description of creation it transpires how AVI (Hochma and Bina) beget ZON (all %0a%3c of creation, including us) and elevate them to their final state during the 6,000 %0a%3c years. This is what The Book of Zohar tells us. %0a%3c %0a%3c Rabbi Hizkiyah began his explanation of Nukva of the world of Atzilut %0a%3c by clarifying the birth of ZON from Ima (Bina), called Elokim. That is why he %0a%3c began his explanation with a rose, Nukva of ZA. At the utmost completion of %0a%3c its development, Nukva of ZA is called Knesset Israel, the Assembly of Israel. %0a%3c For Nukva consists of all the souls called Israel; hence, it is said that a rose is %0a%3c Knesset Israel. %0a%3c %0a%3c There are two states in a rose (Malchut). The lowest, initial, small state %0a%3c (Katnut) is when Malchut consists only of Sefira Keter filled with the Light %0a%3c Nefesh, while her other nine Sefirot are those that fell from the world of Atzilut %0a%3c to the world of Beria. The other state of Nukva is mature, big, complete %0a%3c (Gadlut), when her nine Sefirot ascend from the world of Beria back to the %0a%3c world of Atzilut, and complete the full ten Sefirot of her Partzuf. Then, being %0a%3c equal to her husband, Malchut ascends together with him to AVI and clothes %0a%3c them, i.e., receives their Light. %0a%3c %0a%3c The clothing of the lower, outer Partzuf onto the Upper, Inner One means %0a%3c that the lower Partzuf attains a part of the Upper One, ascends to a Higher %0a%3c spiritual level, and becomes in some way similar to the Upper Partzuf. %0a%3c %0a%3c In that state, ZA is called Israel, from the letters LI (to me) and ROSH %0a%3c (head), which signifies the state of Gadlut, while Nukva is called "the Assembly %0a%3c of Israel," for she accumulates all of the Light of her husband, ZA, and passes it %0a%3c to the lower ones— the souls in the worlds BYA. %0a%3c %0a%3c Nukva 's state of Katnut is called "a rose among thorns," for nine of her lower %0a%3c Sefirot in the Katnut state fell under the Parsa of the world of Atzilut, thereby %0a%3c losing the Light of the world of Atzilut, and becoming as dry as thorns. And in %0a%3c her Gadlut state, Nukva is simply called "a rose" or "the Assembly of Israel." This %0a%3c is why it is written, "there is a rose, and there is a rose." %0a%3c %0a%3c The color red designates the rose's connection with the outer, impure forces, %0a%3c which, because of this connection, can suck the strength (Light) from it. This is %0a%3c because nine of her Sefirot are in exile below the world of Atzilut, in the world %0a%3c of Beria, which may already contain impure forces. And the rose also has a color %0a%3c white in its Sefira Keter, for her Sefira Keter is in the world of Atzilut, above the %0a%3c Parsa, where there is no contact with the lower, impure forces. In other words, %0a%3c there are two opposite states: perfection and its absence, Light and darkness. %0a%3c They are felt by him who merits it. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 58 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c It is therefore written that just as a rose among thorns is tinged with red %0a%3c and white, so does the Assembly of Israel consist of judgment and mercy. This %0a%3c shows that in Gadlut, when Malchut is called Knesset Israel, even though she %0a%3c ascended to Bina and clothed her, she still retains the property of judgment, of %0a%3c restriction— an attitude that's tough and just, rather than compassionate. This %0a%3c is so because she needs a screen (a force of resistance to her egoistic desires), %0a%3c which, if available, enables Malchut to receive the Upper Light. %0a%3c %0a%3c The law, judgment, or restriction does not allow for the reception of Light %0a%3c in egoistic desires. The screen, the aspiration to oppose one's egoistic desires, %0a%3c repels the Upper Light (pleasure) back to its source, the Creator. The Light that %0a%3c man sends back is called "Returning Light" or the "Light of Judgment." To %0a%3c the extent of the intensity of the reflective force (i.e., the force of resistance to %0a%3c one's will to receive), man is allowed to receive the ten Sefirot of the Upper Light %0a%3c (called the Direct Light or the Light of Mercy) for the Creator's sake, in precisely %0a%3c these altruistic desires. And that is why, even in its complete state, the Assembly %0a%3c of Israel consists of judgment and mercy, which corresponds to the red and %0a%3c white colors of a rose among thorns. %0a%3c %0a%3c And this is the pool made by King Shlomo (Solomon). It is built on twelve %0a%3c bulls, for the nine lower Sefirot of Malchut that fell to the world of Beria were %0a%3c corrected there from twelve heads of bulls. One of their Sefirot, Keter, which %0a%3c remained in the world of Atzilut, is called the "pool" that is built on these bulls. %0a%3c Together, they are called thirteen rose petals. (The reason why the ten Sefirot of %0a%3c Malchut are divided by ten-Hassadim or thirteen-Hochma will be clarified later). %0a%3c %0a%3c The Light of a complete Nukva is called Hochma, as it contains the Light of %0a%3c Wisdom, and originates from the thirteen names called "the thirteen attributes %0a%3c of mercy." However, the main thing that Rabbi Hizkiyah wants to tell us is that %0a%3c a rose among thorns is above the Assembly of Israel, because, as is well known, %0a%3c all that is present in Nukva's complete state must exist in her small state as well, %0a%3c albeit in diminished similarity. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, it is said that the properties of white and red in the small state %0a%3c correspond to the properties of mercy and judgment in the big state. And the %0a%3c thirteen petals of the small state, when corrected, create in Nukva the thirteen %0a%3c attributes of mercy in her big state. Later on, we will see how these thirteen %0a%3c attributes of Malchut of the world of Atzilut change her in both the small and %0a%3c big states. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is written that, in the process of creation, "in the beginning Elokim (Bina %0a%3c de Atzilut) created" Nukva of ZA with thirteen words: ET, SHAMAJM, VE'ET, %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Rose %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 59 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ARETZ, VEARETZ, HAITA, TOHL7, VABOHU, VECHOSHECH, AL, PNEI, %0a%3c TEHOM, VERLACH (from the word Elokim to the word Elokim). And these %0a%3c thirteen words signify the thirteen petals of a rose among thorns (her small %0a%3c state), like the pool built by the King Shlomo, which stands on thirteen (twelve) %0a%3c bulls (nine lower Sefirot of Malchut without Light, as they are in the world of %0a%3c Beria, below the Parsa of the world of Atzilut). These words are the preparation %0a%3c for the purification and correction of the Assembly of Israel in order to receive %0a%3c the thirteen attributes of mercy. %0a%3c %0a%3c These thirteen attributes of mercy (the Light of a complete Nukva) surround %0a%3c her and shine upon her from all sides, and guard her from the touch of foreign %0a%3c (egoistic) desires. After all, until she is filled with all the Light of Hochma in her %0a%3c complete, big state, there's a potential for foreign, egoistic desires to cling to and %0a%3c feed off her. %0a%3c %0a%3c 2. Afterwards, the name Elokim is mentioned once more, "Elokim soars." %0a%3c Why is it mentioned in this sense? So as to bring out the five rigid leaves that %0a%3c surround the rose, which are called "salvation." And these are the five gates. %0a%3c And it is said of this secret, I will raise the "cup of salvation" (Psalms, 116:13). %0a%3c It is the cup of blessing. The cup of blessing must rest on five fingers, just as a %0a%3c rose rests on five rigid leaves that correspond to the five fingers. And this rose is %0a%3c the cup of blessing, from the second to the third mention of the name Elokim %0a%3c (Beresheet, 1:2-3), there are five words: "soars," "over," "the surface," "of the %0a%3c waters," "and said"— in all, five words parallel the five leaves. And further, %0a%3c "The Creator said, 'Let there be Light'"— this Light was created. However, it %0a%3c was concealed and enclosed within that covenant that entered the rose and %0a%3c fructified it. And it is referred to as "A fructiferous tree, wherein is the seed %0a%3c thereof" (Beresheet, 1:12). And this seed exists in the mark of the covenant. %0a%3c %0a%3c The five leaves are the five Sefirot of the Light reflected from Malchut, which %0a%3c she raises from the Zivug de Hakaa. The direct incoming Light is called five %0a%3c Hassadim HGT-NH, and it clothes into five parts (types of restrictions) of the %0a%3c Returning Light HGT-NH, called the five rigid leaves of a rose, which correspond %0a%3c to the text from the second (the spirit of God soared over the waters) to the third %0a%3c (and said) mention of the word Elokim in the Torah. %0a%3c %0a%3c These words explain how the five rigid leaves (attributes) can be extracted %0a%3c from Malchut so that she will be fit for a Zivug and achieve the big state. And %0a%3c during the big state, when the five rigid leaves become five restrictions, they %0a%3c are defined as the five gates of reception of the Light of Hassadim of the Direct %0a%3c Light, and they are called salvation, and Malchut is called the cup of salvation or %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 60 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c the cup of blessing and good fortune, for, thanks to these leaves (restrictions), %0a%3c Malchut can receive the Light of Hassadim— a blessing. %0a%3c %0a%3c The cup of blessing must rest on five fingers, for Malchut can receive the Light %0a%3c of Hochma only if she is clothed in the Light of Hassadim beforehand. Therefore, %0a%3c first she has to make a blessing, which means to receive the five parts (NRNHY) %0a%3c of the Light of Hassadim with the help of five fingers (five restrictions), and only %0a%3c then to receive in them (i.e., in the corrected intentions) the Light of Hochma. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, a cup of wine must be raised with two hands, as five fingers of %0a%3c the right hand symbolize mercy— Hassadim, and five fingers of the left hand %0a%3c symbolize restrictions. However, having started the blessing, the cup must only %0a%3c be held with the five fingers of the right hand (Hassadim, bestowing). Otherwise, %0a%3c the impure forces that take from the left (receiving) side become active, as such %0a%3c forces cling only to a place where there is reception of Light. %0a%3c %0a%3c What follows is the big state of Malchut, which corresponds to the words %0a%3c of the To rah: "Let there be Light." These are the five lights, in which Adam %0a%3c saw the world from end to end, as it is written in the Talmud (Hagigah, 12). %0a%3c But the Creator saw that there would be transgressions in the generations of %0a%3c the Flood and the Tower of Babel, and concealed this Light. And the following %0a%3c generations will then need to attain it on their own. %0a%3c %0a%3c Previously, these five Hassadim were in Yesod of ZA, and Malchut received %0a%3c from it, and not from Bina, called Elokim, as she does now. Yesod de ZA is %0a%3c called the mark of the covenant with the Creator (after the corrections, called %0a%3c circumcision, are made), and five Hassadim received on the five restrictions are %0a%3c called "seed." The main force of restrictions and the impact forces of the screen, %0a%3c with which it repels the Light, are in Ateret Yesod (the end of the Sefira Yesod). %0a%3c There occurs Zivug de Hakaa, from which Malchut receives the Light. Only at the %0a%3c end of correction will this Zivug pass on to Malchut herself. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, during the 6,000 years, the screen that is in Yesod, strikes at %0a%3c the incoming Light (pleasure) with its five restrictions (the forces that oppose %0a%3c egoistic reception of pleasure), thus creating five parts of the Returning Light, %0a%3c and receiving in them the five parts of the Light of Hassadim. Subsequently, %0a%3c ZA passes these five Lights of Hassadim from his Yesod to Nukva. And these five %0a%3c Lights of Hassadim are called "seed." %0a%3c %0a%3c 3. Just as the covenant is conceived from that seed in forty-two Zivugim, %0a%3c so the secret name fills and inseminates all forty-two letters of the initial %0a%3c act of creation. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Rose %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 61 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The name "forty-two" = MB = Mem + Bet = 40 + 2 is composed of HaVaYaH %0a%3c (four letters), filled HaVaYaH (ten letters), and doubly filled HaVaYaH (twenty- %0a%3c eight letters). In all, 4 + 10 + 28 = 42, signifying the seed that exists in the mark %0a%3c of the covenant that is enclosed in five Hassadim and five Gevurot. %0a%3c %0a%3c There are two aspects to Nukva: her body (Partzuf), which emerges from Bina, %0a%3c and her Zivug, called the secret of unity with ZA. Nukva can be in two states: %0a%3c small or big (Katnut or Gadlut respectively). The small state is an incomplete, %0a%3c insufficient state of Malchut, but it is necessary as preparation for the big state, %0a%3c called the revelation of the secret, of the concealed. %0a%3c %0a%3c And since the big state reveals the small, and all that is concealed in the %0a%3c small state becomes clear in the big, he who is in a state of spiritual descent does %0a%3c not see the reasons for his state, but it all becomes clear to him when he attains %0a%3c the big state that follows. %0a%3c %0a%3c As a result of the ascent of Malchut of AVI to their Bina, Partzuf of Bina (AVI) %0a%3c was divided into two parts: the upper part, GE, acquired the name AVI, while %0a%3c the lower part, AHP, became known as YESHSUT. AVI are filled with the Light %0a%3c of Hassadim, since they wish for no other, and YESHSUT receives it from them, %0a%3c for, although it desires the Light of Hochma, it cannot receive it in view of the %0a%3c fact that Malchut of AVI ascended above it. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, although there is no Light of Hochma in AVI, they do not suffer %0a%3c without it whatsoever, and therefore exist in perfection called GAR, even in the %0a%3c absence of the Light of Hochma. And even when one raises MAN requesting %0a%3c strength (i.e., the Light of Hochma) so as to overcome his impure desires, AVI %0a%3c do not receive the Light of Hochma. YESHSUT receives this Light and passes it %0a%3c to ZA. Hence, although AVI are below the Rosh of AA, and there is no Light of %0a%3c Hochma in them, they do not suffer from it. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, YESHSUT suffers from the absence of the Light of Hochma, %0a%3c wishing to pass it to ZA, so it waits for MAN from ZA in order to ascend to AVI %0a%3c in the form of Sefira Daat. For when the lower ones raise MAN, the whole of %0a%3c Bina ascends to the Rosh of AA; YESHSUT receives the Light of Hochma from %0a%3c AA and passes it to ZON. This corresponds to the disappearance of the letter Yod %0a%3c from the word Avir (air), and Avir turns into Ohr— Light (Hochma) once more. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, for all that, even in the Rosh of AA, AVI remain only with the Light %0a%3c of Hassadim (air). Hence, the heads of both AA and AVI are called "Supreme %0a%3c Waters" or "Heaven." This is considering the fact that AVI can be beneath the %0a%3c Rosh of AA; however, since it does not affect their independence and perfection, %0a%3c it is as if they are in the Rosh of AA. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 62 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Under AVI there is a firmament (Parsa) of the world of Atzilut, which %0a%3c separates the Kelim of bestowal from the Kelim of reception of the world of %0a%3c Atzilut. YESHSUT and ZON (inferior waters) that need the Light of Hochma %0a%3c stand below the Parsa, which is in the chest of AA. It is therefore said that %0a%3c the inferior waters weep (i.e., their state is small), for they feel the lack of Ohr %0a%3c Hochma and wish to ascend to the Rosh of AA. In no way should one confuse %0a%3c the Parsa of the world of Atzilut (located within the world of Atzilut) that divides %0a%3c it into GE and AHP with the Parsa below the world Atzilut that separates it from %0a%3c the worlds of BYA. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Light that is received above the Parsa of the world of Atzilut is called the %0a%3c Light of Mem-Bet (MB). However, the seven Sefirot of ZON (six Sefirot of ZA and %0a%3c one Sefira of Malchut) that designate the seven days of creation cannot receive %0a%3c this Light of MB, as they are located below the Parsa and receive only the Light %0a%3c of Hassadim (minimal sustenance) from YESHSUT. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, when the lower ones (man) raise MAN, and MAD descends from %0a%3c AB-SAG (the Light that brings Bina back to the Rosh of AA), YESHSUT receives %0a%3c the Light of Hochma and passes it to ZON, allowing ZON to ascend above the %0a%3c Parsa that stands in the Chazeh (chest) of AA, and receive the Light of MB. %0a%3c %0a%3c That is why the Light of MB in ZON is manifested in thirty-two Elokim and %0a%3c ten sayings, where thirty-two Elokim represent YESHSUT in the state of ascent, %0a%3c when YESHSUT receives thirty-two streams of wisdom (Hochma) that create in %0a%3c it the thirty-two names of Elokim, mentioned in the act of creation: "In the %0a%3c beginning the Creator created," and so on. %0a%3c %0a%3c The ten sayings are five Hassadim. After ZON have already received the %0a%3c Light of Hochma from thirty-two Elokim, the five Lights of Hassadim that were %0a%3c received from AVI (signifying MB) are called "Supreme Waters." We see that the %0a%3c five Hassadim in ZON do not turn into the name MB before they receive from %0a%3c thirty-two Elokim. It is therefore said that thirty-two Elokim and ten sayings form %0a%3c the name MB, i.e., in the state of ascent. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, Rabbi Hizkiyah said that the five Lights in the saying "Let there be %0a%3c Light" (signifying the five Hassadim) are called "seed" (abundance), which Yesod %0a%3c of ZA passes to Malchut. And it is called MB, although essentially it is merely %0a%3c five Hassadim; however, since it has the Light of Hochma that was received from %0a%3c thirty-two Elokim of YESHSUT, it refers to MB. %0a\ No newline at end of file%0a
