text=The First Commandment %0a%0a%0a%0a189. BERESHEET BARAH ELOKIM (In the beginning the Creator created) %0ais the first Mitzva (commandment), the root and foundation of everything. %0aAnd it is called "fear of the Creator" or Resheet (beginning), as it is written: %0a"Fear of the Creator is the beginning of wisdom." Fear of the Creator is the %0abeginning of wisdom, for this fear is called "the beginning." And it is the gate %0athat leads to faith. And the whole world is based on this Mitzva. %0a%0aIt is difficult to understand why fear is called "the beginning," and why it %0aprecedes wisdom and faith. The Zohar answers: it is because fear is the beginning %0aof every Sefira, and it is impossible to attain any Sefira (property) without first %0aattaining the property of fear. Yet, this implies that fear is merely a means of %0aattaining other qualities or properties. But then, if it is only a means, then why %0ais it included in the list of Mitzvot (plural for Mitzva) as the first Mitzva 7 . Can it %0abe that fear is a kind of prerequisite? %0a%0aTherefore, The Zohar says that it is impossible to attain perfect, selfless faith %0ain any way other than through fear of the Creator. And the extent of fear will %0adetermine the extent of faith. Hence, the whole world is based on the Mitzva %0aof fear, for the whole world exists only thanks to the Torah and Mitzvot, as %0athe prophet said: "If not for My union with day and night, I would not have %0aappointed the ordinances of Heaven and earth" (Yirmiyahu, 33:25). %0a%0aAnd since fear is the beginning and the gate to the other Mitzvot (for fear %0ais also the gate to faith), the whole world is based on this property of fear. It %0ais hence written that the Mitzva of fear includes all of the other Mitzvot of the %0aTorah; and were it not for fear, the Creator would not have created anything. %0a%0a190. There are three types of fear, two of which have no real basis, but one %0adoes. If man fears that his children may die, or fears illness or bodily suffering, %0aor fears for his material well-being, this kind of fear (even if constant) is not %0athe basis or root, for only desirable consequences constitute the cause of fear. %0a%0a%0a%0a379 %0a%0a%0a%0a380 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aThis is called "the fear of punishment in this world." But there is also another %0atype of fear: the fear of punishment in the world to come, in hell. These %0atwo types of fear— the fear of punishment in this world and in the world to %0acome— do not constitute real basis and root. %0a%0a191. The real fear is the fear of the Creator, for He is great and almighty, for %0aHe is the Source of everything, and all else is nothing compared to Him. Man %0ashould concentrate all his attention on attaining this kind of fear. %0a%0aThere are three kinds of fear before the Creator, but only one of them is %0aconsidered true fear. If one is afraid of the Creator, and observes His Mitzvot so %0ahe and his children will be well and prosperous, this constitutes the first kind, %0athe fear of the various punishments in this world. If he observes the Create %0aMitzvot because he fears punishments in hell, this is the second kind of fea %0aZohar says that neither of these two kinds is true, for man observes the Mitz %0aonly out of fear of punishment, for the sake of his own benefit, and not beca %0athese are the Creator's Mitzvot. %0a%0aIn this case, his personal wellbeing is the cause of his observance, and his %0ar is merely a consequence of his will to receive pleasure. Rather, true fear %0at stem from the Creator's greatness and omnipotence, for He rules %0ae source of everything. All the worlds emerge from Him, and His %0atestify to His greatness. And all that He created is nothing compared tc %0afor it adds nothing to Him. %0a%0aThus, we can plainly see that there is no difference in action: one observes %0aout of the first or second kinds of fear, while the other observes out of the third %0akind. To an onlooker, they perform the same actions, the Creator's Mitzvot. %0athe enormous difference between them lies only in their intention, %0ay they observe the Creator's decree! %0a%0apossible to discern man's spiritual degree by his %0aitzvot, which is visible to all. Moreover, those who %0athem in order to receive an immediate reward from others usually do so with %0athe utmost outward zeal. But one whose intentions and thoughts are directed %0ainwardly, who seeks true observance, as a rule, does not stand out amidst the %0amasses in any way. %0a%0aOne must constantly seek to perfect and complement his intentions only %0aby observing the Mitzvot at an increasingly deeper level, while focusing on inner %0acontemplation and direction of his thoughts. In no way should he engage in %0aexcessive "mechanical observance," on which there is a clear prohibition: "Do %0anot exaggerate in the Mitzvot." %0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0aThe First Commandment %0a%0a%0a%0a381 %0a%0a%0a%0aOn the contrary, one must devote all his attention to the attainment of true %0afear, as the Creator's first Mitzva decrees. As Rabbi Baruch Ashlag said, "Fear %0aof the Creator is the constant, selfless desire that is expressed in the thought: %0a'Have I done everything I could for the Creator, or is there anything more that %0aI can do for Him?'" %0a%0a192. Rabbi Shimon started to weep, wailing, "Woe if 1 reveal and woe %0aif I do not reveal. If 1 say, the sinners will know how to work for the %0aCreator's sake, and if 1 do not say, it will not reach my friends." Wherever %0athere is true fear, opposite it and correspondingly below stands an evil fear, %0awhich strikes and prosecutes. It is the scourge that whips the sinners %0a(punishing them for their sins). This is why he is afraid to reveal it, for the %0asinners may learn how to avoid punishment, and punishment constitutes %0atheir correction! %0a%0aHere Rabbi Shimon warns that he cannot reveal everything in its entirety %0a(this refers to Avoda Lishma— work "for the Creator's sake"), for he fears it may %0aharm the sinners. Here he wishes to reveal how one can draw nearer and merge %0awith the Tree of Life, and therewith refrain from touching the Tree of Death. %0aHowever, this refers only to those who have already corrected themselves with %0aregard to the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. %0a%0aNevertheless, the sinners (those who have yet to correct their transgressions %0ain the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil) are not entitled to know this, for %0athey still need to toil in all the required tasks until they correct themselves in %0athe Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. Thus we see that the Torah defines a %0asinner as one who is yet to correct the Tree of Knowledge in his soul. %0a%0aThe prohibition on revealing the true essence of the work for the Creator's %0asake is based on the words of the Torah: "Behold, Adam has become as one of %0aus in knowledge of good and evil; and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take %0aalso of the Tree of Life, and eat, and live forever" {Be.re.she.et, 3:22). %0a%0aAfter Adam's sin in the Tree of Knowledge, the Creator banished him %0afrom the Garden of Eden to prevent Adam from connecting to the Tree of Life %0aand gaining eternal life. This is because then, what he corrupted in the Tree %0aof Knowledge would remain uncorrected. Therefore, to let only the righteous %0aknow this wisdom, Rabbi Shimon reveals it by way of allusion. %0a%0a193. But he who fears the punishment by whippings, the true fear of the %0aCreator cannot descend upon him. Instead, evil fear overtakes him in the %0aform of fearing punishment by whipping. %0a%0a%0a%0a382 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0a194. Therefore, the place that is named "fear of the Creator" is called the %0abeginning of knowledge. This is why this Mitzva is included here. And it is %0athe foundation and source of all the other Mitzvot of the Torah. And whoever %0aobserves the Mitzva of fear of the Creator, thereby observes all the others. But %0ahe who does not observe the Mitzva of fear of the Creator, does not observe %0athe other Mitzvot of the Torah, for this Mitzva constitutes the foundation for %0aall the others. %0a%0aHere The Zohar repeats that in one place it is written, "Fear of the Creator %0ais the beginning of wisdom," while in another it says, "Fear of the Creator is the %0abeginning of knowledge." And The Zohar explains that where the property of %0afear ends, another evil fear begins, one that slanders and whips. In this regard, %0ait is said in Kabbalah that the legs of a pure Partzuf Malchut descend to a place %0aof impure forces. %0a%0aHowever, he who observes the Mitzva of fear because the Creator is great %0aand almighty unites with Him (becomes equal to the Creator in his properties), %0aso as to not feel shame in receiving from Him. Besides this correction, no other %0awork exists for the creatures. %0a%0aThis is called "fear of the Creator for the sake of life," for as a result of %0amerging with the Creator, creatures are filled with life. Otherwise, they fall %0aunder the power of the restriction, as Tzimtzum Aleph (first restriction) restricted %0athe reception of Light in egoistic desires. Such a Kli (desire) becomes a cause %0aof death, for it is an empty place (devoid of Light). Hence, creatures must fear %0afailing to make the corrections that they were entrusted with. %0a%0aHowever, those who observe the Mitzvot out of fear, rather than out of %0arealization of the Creator's greatness and His decree, are ruled and whipped by %0athe fear of an empty Malchut. And since the end of fear lies in the evil scourge, %0atrue fear is called "The beginning of knowledge of the fear of the Creator," %0awhich indicates the necessity to aspire only to this kind of fear, and beware of %0athe evil kind. Because of this, Adam's sin is corrected. %0a%0a195. Therefore, it is written, IN THE BEGINNING (signifying fear) THE %0aCREATOR CREATED THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH. For whoever %0atransgresses here, transgresses all of the Torah Mitzvot. And his punishment %0ais the evil scourge, i.e., the evil fear that whips him. The words, AND THE %0aEARTH WAS UNFORMED AND CHAOTIC, AND DARKNESS WAS %0aUPON THE FACE OF THE DEEP, AND THE SPIRIT OF THE CREATOR %0arefer to the four punishments of the wicked. %0a%0a%0a%0aThe First Commandment %0a%0a%0a%0a383 %0a%0a%0a%0a196. WITHOUT FORM refers to strangulation. CHAOTIC refers to stoning, %0ai.e., the stones that fall into the great deep to punish the sinners. DARKNESS %0asignifies burning, the fire that falls upon the heads of the wicked to burn %0athem down. THE SPIRIT OF THE CREATOR refers to beheading. %0a%0aThose who observe the Mitzva of fear before the Creator not because such is %0aHis decree, but because they are afraid of punishment, fall into the impure force's %0atrap, called "without form." As a result, they are lost, having no understanding %0aof the Creator's thoughts and deeds. And this impure force is defined as a rope %0aon man's neck, blocking the inflow of pure (holy) air to his soul and preventing %0ahim from gaining life. And to the extent of man's ignorance, the impure force %0astrangulates him! %0a%0aAnd when he is caught in the impure force's noose, tightening around his %0aneck, it has the power to control man at its will: to stone, burn, or behead him. %0aStoning means that impure thoughts befall his head with desired pleasures, %0athus pulling him down into the deep. There they punish him with darkness %0a(burning), and the impure force turns him on fierce fire until it burns all the %0apure life-force out of him. %0a%0a197. The spirit of the Creator means beheading, for the scorching wind %0a(Ruach Se'ara) is a flaming sword— punishment for whoever does not observe %0athe Torah and Mitzvot that are mentioned after the Mitzva of fear, called %0a"foundation," as it includes all the Mitzvot. This is because after the word %0aBERESHEET (BEGINNING), which signifies fear, it is written WITHOUT %0aFORM, CHAOS, DARKNESS and SPIRIT-in all, the four penalties of death. %0aAnd then follow the rest of the Torah and Mitzvot. %0a%0aFollowing the first sentence of the Torah, the remaining part of the Torah %0arefers to the rest of the Mitzvot, which are particular with regard to the general %0aand all-inclusive Mitzva of fear.
