text=BOOK XXXI. %0a%0aREMEDIES DERIVED FROM THE AQUATIC PRODUCTIONS. %0a%0aCHAT. 1. (1.)—REMARKABLE FACTS CONNECTED WITH WATER. %0a%0aWe have now to speak of the benefits derived, in a medicinal %0apoint of view, from the aquatic productions ; for not here even %0ahas all-bounteous Nature reposed from her work. Amid waves %0aand billows, and tides of rivers for ever on the ebb and flow, %0ashe still unceasingly exerts her powers ; and nowhere, if we %0amust confess the truth, does she display herself in greater %0amight, for it is this among the elements that holds sway over %0aall the rest. It is -water that swallows up dry land, that %0aextinguishes flame, that ascends aloft, and challenges posses¬ %0asion of the very heavens : it is water that, spreading clouds as %0ait does, far and wide, intercepts the vital air we breathe; and, %0athrough their collision, gives rise to thunders and lightnings, 1 %0aas the elements of the universe meet in conflict. %0a%0aWhat can there be more marvellous than waters suspended %0aaloft in the heavens ? And yet, as though it were not enough to %0areach so high an elevation as this, they sweep along with them %0awhole shoals of fishes, and often stones as -well, thus lading %0athemselves with ponderous masses which belong to other %0aelements, and bearing them on high. Falling upon the earth, %0athese waters become the prime cause of all that is there pro¬ %0aduced ; a truly wondrous provision of Nature, if we only con¬ %0asider, that in order to give birth to grain and life to trees and %0ato shrubs, water must first leave the earth for the heavens, and %0athence bring down to vegetation the breath of life! The %0aadmission must be surely extorted from us, that for all our %0aresources the earth is indebted to the bounteousness of water. %0a%0a1 See B. ii. c. 43. Ajasson remarks, that the electric fluid, forming %0alightning, escapes from the clouds through causes totally independent of %0awater. Still, Pliny would appear to be right in one sense; for if there %0awere no water, there would be no clouds ; and without clouds the electric %0afluid would probably take some other form than that of lightning. %0a%0a%0a472 flint’s natural HISTORY. [Book XXXI. %0a%0aIt will be only proper, therefore, in the first place to set forth %0asome instances of the powerful properties displayed by this %0aelement; for as to the whole of them, what living mortal could %0adescribe them ? %0a%0aCHAP. 2. (2.)— THE DIFFERENT PROPERTIES OF WATERS. %0a%0aOn all sides, and in a thousand countries, there are waters %0abounteously springing forth from the earth, someot them cold, %0asome hot, and some possessed of these properties united : those %0ain the teri'itory of the Tarbelli, 2 for instance, a people of Atjui- %0atania, and those among the Pyrenoean 3 Mountains, where hot %0aand cold springs are separated by only the very smallest dis¬ %0atance. Then, again, there are others that are tepid only, or %0alukewarm, announcing thereby the resources they afford for %0athe treatment of diseases, and bursting forth, for the benefit of %0aman alone, out of so many animated beings. 4 5 %0a%0aUnder various names, too, they augment the number of the %0adivinities,® and give birth to cities ; Puteoli, 6 for example, in %0aCampania, Statyellse 7 in Liguria, and Sextise 8 in the province %0aof Gallia Narbonensis. But nowhere do they abound in greater %0anumber, or offer a greater variety of medicinal properties than %0ain the Gulf of Baim ; 9 some being impregnated with sulphur, %0asome with alum, some with salt, some with nitre, 10 and some %0awith bitumen, while others are of a mixed quality, partly acid %0aand partly salt. In other cases, again, it is by their vapours %0athat waters are so beneficial to man, being so intensely hot as %0ato heat our baths even, and to make cold water boil in our %0asitting-baths; such, for instance, as the springs at Baiae, now %0aknown as “ Posidian,” after the name of a freedman 11 of the %0aEmperor Claudius; waters which are so hot as to cook articles %0a%0a2 He alludes to the mineral waters of Acqs or Dax on the Adour, in the %0aFrench department of the Ariege. They are still highly esteemed. %0a%0a3 The principal of which are those of Aigues-Chaudes, Aigues-Bonnes, %0aBagneres-Adores, Cambo, Bagnbres, Bareges, Saint-Sauveur, and Cauteret. %0a%0a4 Ajasson remarks that animals in all cases refuse to drink mineral waters. %0a%0a5 He alludes to Neptune, Amphitrite, the Oceanides, Nereides, Tritons, %0aCrenides, Limnades, Potamides, and numerous other minor divinities. %0a%0a6 See B. iii. c. 9. 7 See B. iii. c. 7. 8 See B. iii. c. 5. %0a%0a9 The mineral waters of Bairn are still held in high esteem. %0a%0a1C As to the identity of the “ nitrum ” of Pliny, see c. 46 of this Book. %0a%0a11 Posides, a eunuch who belonged to the Emperor Claudius, according %0a%0ato Suetonius, c. 28. %0a%0a%0aChap. 3.] %0a%0a%0aREMEDIES DEBITED FROM WATER. %0a%0a%0a473 %0a%0a%0aof food even. There are others, too,—those, for example, %0aformerly the property of Licinius Crassus—which send forth %0atheir vapours in the sea 12 even, thus providing resources for the %0ahealth of man in the very midst of the waves ! %0a%0a%0aCHAP. 3.-REMEDIES DERIVED FROM WATER. %0a%0a%0aAccording to their respective kinds, these waters are bene¬ %0aficial for diseases of the sinews, feet, or hips, for spraiDS or for %0afractures; they act, also, as purgatives upon the bowels, heal %0awounds, 13 and are singularly useful for affections of the head %0aand ears : indeed, the waters of Cicero are good for the eyes. 14 %0aThe country-seat where these last are found is worthy of some %0afurther mention : travelling from Lake Avernus towards %0aPuteoli, it is to be seen on the sea-shore, renowned for its fine %0aportico and its grove. Cicero gave it the name of Academia, 15 %0aafter the place so called at Athens : it was here that he com¬ %0aposed those treatises 16 of his that were called after it; it was %0ahere, too, that he raised those monuments 17 to himself; as %0athough, indeed, he had not already done so throughout the %0alength and breadth of the known world. %0a%0aShortly after the death of Cicero, and when it had come %0ainto the possession of Antistius Vetus, 18 certain hot springs %0aburst forth at the very portals 19 of this house, which were %0afound to be remarkably beneficial for diseases of the eyes, and %0ahave been celebrated in verse by Laurca Tullius, 20 one of the %0afreedmen of Cicero ; a fact which proves to demonstration that %0ahis servants even had received inspiration from that majestic %0aand all-powerful genius of his. I will give the lines, as they %0adeserve to be read, not there only, but everywhere : %0a%0a%0a12 There are still submarine volcanoes in tbe vicinity of Sicily, but the %0aspot here referred to is now unknown. %0a%0a12 The Eaux Bonnes in the Basses Pyrenees are good for wounds. After %0athe battle of Pavia they received from the soldiers of Jean d’Albret, king %0aof Navarre, the name of Eaux d’arquebusade. _ . „ %0a%0a11 Only, Aiasson remarks, where the ophthalmia is caused by inflam¬ %0amation of the conjunctive. 15 He also called it his Puteolan villa. %0a%0a16 The “ Qumstiones Academic®.” %0a%0a17 “ Monumenta.” Ajasson queries what monuments they were, thus %0araised bv the “ parvenu of Arpinum.” He suggests that the erection may %0ahave been a chapel, temple-library, or possibly funeral monument. %0a%0a18 C Antistius Yetus probably, a supporter of Julius Caesar, Consul %0a%0aqnffpphic n c 30 19 “ l' 1 parte pnma. %0a%0a20 There are three Epigrams, probably by this author, in the Greek An¬ %0athology. %0a%0a%0a474 %0a%0a%0apliny’s natural history. %0a%0a%0a[Book XXXI. %0a%0a%0aGreat prince of Eoman eloquence, thy grove, %0a%0aWhere erst thou bad’st it rise, is verdant now : %0a%0aThy villa, from fair Academia 21 nam’d, %0a%0aFrom Yetus now its finish’d graces takes. %0a%0aHere, too, fair streams burst forth, unknown before, %0a%0aWhich with their spray the languid eyes relieve. %0a%0aThe land, I ween, these bounteous springs reveal’d, %0a%0aTo honour Cicero, its ancient lord. %0a%0aThroughout the world his works by eyes are scann’d; %0a%0aMay eyes unnumber’d by these streams be heal’d. %0a%0aCHAP. 4.—WATERS PRODUCTIVE OF FECUNDITY. WATERS CURATIVE %0aOF INSANITY. %0a%0aIn Campania, too, are the waters of Sinuessa, 22 remedial, it %0ais said, for sterility in females, and curative of insanity in men. %0a%0aCHAP. 5.-WATERS REMEDIAL FOR URINARY CALCULI. %0a%0aThe waters of the island of JEnaria are curative of urinary %0acalculi, 23 it is said; and the same is the case with the cold %0aspring of Acidula, 21 four miles distant from Teanum 25 Sidici- %0anum, the waters at Stabise, knowm as the Dimidiae, 28 and those %0ain the territory of Venafrum, 27 which take their rise in the %0aspring of Acidula. Patients suffering from these complaints %0amay be cured also by drinking the waters of Lake Velia j 28 the %0asame effects being produced by those of a spring in Syria, near %0aMount Taurus, M. Varro says, and by those of the river Callus %0ain Phrygia, as we learn from Callimachus. In taking the waters, %0ahowever, of this last, the greatest moderation is necessary, as %0athey are apt to cause delirium; an effect equally produced, %0aCtesias tells us, by the waters of the Red Fountain 22 in %0a^Ethiopia. %0a%0a21 We are sensible that, in thus shortening the penultimate, we shall %0aincur the censure of solecizing, which Hardouin has cast upon the poet %0aClaudian for doing the same. %0a%0a22 At the Torre de’ Bagni, Hardouin says, near the church of Santa %0aMaria a Caudara. %0a%0a23 Saline and gaseous waters are good for this purpose. See B. iii. c. 12. %0a%0a24 It has still the same reputation, Hardouin says, and is situate near %0a%0athe castle of Francolici. 25 See B. iii. c. 9. %0a%0a26 Or “ half-strength ” waters, apparently. See B. iii. c. 9. %0a%0a27 See B. iii. c. 9. %0a%0a28 See B. ii. cc. 62, 106, and B. iii. c. 17. %0a%0a29 Alluded to, probably, by Ovid, Met. xv. 319, et teq. %0a%0a%0aChap. 8.] %0a%0a%0aWATERS WHICH REMOVE MORPHEW. %0a%0a%0a4/5 %0a%0a%0aCHAP. 6.-WATERS CURATIVE OF WOUNDS. %0a%0aThe tepid waters of Albula, 30 near Rome, have a healing %0aeffect upon wounds. Those of Cutilia, 31 again, in the Sabine %0aterritory, are intensely cold, and by a kind of suction penetrate %0athe body to such a degree as to have the effect of a mordent %0aalmost. They are remarkably beneficial for affections of the %0astomach, sinews, and all parts of the body, in fact. %0a%0aCHAT. 7.-WATERS PREVENTIVE OF ABORTION. %0a%0aThe waters of Thespiae 3 ' 3 ensure conception to females ; the %0asame, too, with those of the river Elatus 33 in Arcadia. The %0aspring Linus, 34 also in Arcadia, acts as a preservative of the %0afmtus, and effectually prevents abortion. The waters of the %0ariver Aphrodisius, on the other hand, in the territory of %0aPyrrhsea, 36 arc productive of sterility. %0a%0aCHAr. 8.-WATERS WHICH REMOVE MORPHEW. %0a%0aThe waters of LakcAlphius remove white morphew, 36 Yarro %0atells us; who also mentions the fact that one Titius, 37 a person¬ %0aage who had held the prsetorship, had a face to all appearance %0alike that of a marble statue, in consequence of this disease. %0aThe waters of the river Cydnus, 38 in Cilicia, are curative of %0agout, as would appear from a letter addressed by Cassius 39 of %0aParma to Marcus Antonius. At Troezen, on the contrary, all %0athe inhabitants are subject to diseases of the feet, owing to the %0abad quality of the water there. The state of the Tungri, 40 in %0a%0a30 The present Bagni di Tivoli. They have other sanitary properties %0aas well, a fact known to Strabo. Martial and Vitruvius also mention them. %0a%0a31 See B. iii. c. 17. Called Cotiscoliae by Strabo. They were of a salt %0a%0aand aluminous nature. 3 - See B. iv. c. 2. %0a%0a33 l’ausanias calls it the “ Elaphus.” %0a%0a34 Isidores, in his “ Origines,” calls it the “ Lechnus.” %0a%0a35 In Thessaly, probably, according to Stepbanus Byzantinus. %0a%0a36 'A \%3ct> 0 £; from which the lake probably derived its name. It has %0abeen suggested that the source of the river Anigrus in Elis is meant. Its %0awaters had an offensive smell, and its fish were not eatable ; and near it %0awere caverns sacred to the Nymphs Anigrides, where persons with cutaneous %0adiseases were cured. The water of these caverns is impregnated with %0asulphur. %0a%0a37 Possibly the M. Titius who was proscribed by the Triumvirs, b.c. 43, %0a%0aand escaped to Sex. Pompeius in Sicily. 38 See B. v. c. 22. %0a%0a39 “ Cassius Parmensis.” See the end of this Book. %0a%0a48 According to some authorities, he alludes to the still famous water's of %0a%0a%0a476 %0a%0a%0aPLINY*® NATURAL HISTORY. %0a%0a%0a[Book XXXI. %0a%0a%0aGaul, has a spring of great renown, which sparkles as it %0abursts forth with bubbles innumerable, and has a certain %0aferruginous taste, only to be perceived after it has been %0adrunk. This water is strongly purgative, is curative of tertian %0afevers, and disperses urinary calculi: upon the application of %0afire it assumes a turbid appearance, and finally turns red. The %0asprings 41 of Lcucogsea, between Puteoli and Xeapolis, are %0acurative of eye diseases and of wounds. Cicero, in his work %0aentitled “ Admiranda,” 42 has remarked that it is only by the %0awaters of the marshes of Keate 43 that the hoofs of beasts of %0aburden are hardened. %0a%0aCHAP. 9.- WATERS WHICH COLOUR THE HAIR. %0a%0aEudicus informs us that in Hestiseotis 44 there are two %0asprings; one of which, Cerona, renders sheep black that drink %0aof it, ivhile the other, called Neleus, turns them white: if, %0aagain, a sheep should happen to drink their waters mixed, its %0afleece will be mottled. According to Theophrastus, the water %0aof the Crathis, 45 a river of Thurii, makes sheep and cattle %0awhite, while that of the river Sybaris turns them black. %0a%0aCHAP. 10.-WATERS WHICH COLOUR THE HUMAN BODY. %0a%0aAnd not only this, but human beings even, Theophrastus %0atells us, are sensible of this difference : for persons who drink %0athe water of the Sybaris, he says, become more swarthy and %0amore hardy, the hair inclining to curl: while those, again, %0aw r ho drink of the Crathis become fair and more soft-skinned, %0awith the hair growing straight and long. So, too, in Mace¬ %0adonia, persons who wish the produce to be white, drive their %0acattle to the river Haliacmon, while those who desire a black %0aor tawny colour, take them to. water at the Axius. Upon the %0a%0aSpa ; but it is more probable that he alludes to the spring still in existence %0aat the adjacent town of Tongres, which was evidently well known to the %0aRomans, and is still-called the “ Fountain of Pliny.” %0a%0a41 The springs on the present Monte Posilippo. %0a%0a42 This work is lost. Chiffiet suggests that “ Yarro ” should be read. %0aSee, however, B. vii. c. 2, B. xxix. c. 16 and c. 28 of this Book. It was %0aa common-place book, probably, of curious facts. %0a%0a43 See B. ii. c. 106, where a growing rock in the marsh of Reate is %0amentioned. %0a%0a44 In Thessaly. A mere fable, no doubt. %0a%0a45 Ovid, Met. xv. 315, et seq., tells very nearly the same fabulous story %0aabout the rivers Crathis and Sybaris. %0a%0a%0aChap. 13.] WATERS WHICH PRODUCE INEBRIETY. 477 %0a%0asame authority, too, we learn that in certain localities, as in %0athe country of the Messapii, for instance, all the productions, %0athe cereals even, grow of a tawny colour; and that at Lusi, 16 %0ain Arcadia, there is a certain fountain in which land-mice %0alive and dwell. The river Aleos, which passes through Ery- %0athrae, promotes the growth of hair upon the body. %0a%0aCHAP. 11.—WATERS WHICH AID THE MEMORY, OR ARE PRODUCTIVE %0aOF FORGETFULNESS. %0a%0aAt the Temple 47 of the god Trophonius, in Bceotia, near the %0ariver Hercynnus, there are two fountains, 49 one of which aids %0athe memory, while the other is productive of forgetfulness: %0ahence the names which they respectively bear. %0a%0aCHAP. 12.-WATERS WHICH SHARPEN OR DULL THE SENSES. %0a%0aWATERS WHICH IMPROVE THE VOICE. %0a%0aNear the town of Cescum, in Cilicia, runs the river Nus, 49 %0athe waters of which, according to Yarro, sharpen the intellect; %0awhile those of a certain spring in the island of Cea dull the %0asenses. At Zama, in Africa, there is a spring, the waters of %0awhich render the voice more musical. 60 %0a%0a%0aCHAP. 13.—WATERS WHICH CAUSE A DISTASTE FOR WINE. WATERS %0aWHICH PRODUCE INEBRIETY. %0a%0a%0aEudoxus says that persons who drink the water 51 of Lake %0aClitorius take a distaste for wine, and Theopompus asserts that %0athe waters of the springs already 6 * named are productive of %0ainebriety. According to Mucianus, 53 there is a fountain at %0a%0a%0a46 This marvellous story appears to have been derived from the works of %0aAristotle. %0a%0a47 Near the town of Lebadea, now Livadhia. %0a%0a46 One called “Mnemosyne,” or Memory, and the other “Lethe,’ or %0a%0a49 From the Greek vovg } “spirit,” “mind, or intelligence. Ajaa- %0ason thinks it possible that its water may have assuaged vertigo, or ac¬ %0acelerated the circulation of the blood, and that thence its reputation. %0a%0a50 A fable invented by the priests, Ajasson thinks, %0a%0a51 See Ovid, Met. xv. 322. It sems to be uncertain whether it was at %0athis lake or ’the adjoining spring of Lnsi above-mentioned, that the %0adaughters of Prcetus were purified by Melampus. See the Lliaca ot %0a%0aPausanias. 62 In B - “• c - ] 06 - %0a%0a53 See B. ii- c. 106. As Ajasson remarks, Muciauus should have had %0athe sense to see that it was only a juggle of the priests ot Bacchus. lie %0a%0a%0a478 %0a%0a%0aprint’s natural histort. %0a%0a%0a[Book xxxr. %0a%0a%0aAndros, consecrated to Father Liber, from which wine flows %0aduring the seven days appointed for the yearly festival of that %0agod, the taste of which becomes like that of water the mo¬ %0ament it is taken out of sight of the temple. %0a%0aCHAP. 14.-WATERS WHICH SERVE AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR OIL. %0a%0aPolyclitus says, that the water 51 of the river Liparis,near %0aSoli, in Cilicia, is used as a substitute for oil, and Theophrastus %0amentions a spring of that name in ./Ethiopia, which is possessed %0aof similar properties. Lycus says, that at Tasitia 66 there is a %0afountain of it, the water of which emits light: the same is %0aasserted, too, of a spring at Ecbatana. According to Theo- %0apompus, there is a lake at Scotussa, 57 the waters of which %0aheal wounds. %0a%0aCHAP. 15.-SALT AND BITTER WATERS. %0a%0aJuba says, that in the country of the Troglodytae there is a %0alake, called the “ Lake of Insanity,” 88 from its highly noxious %0aproperties : thrice a day it becomes salt and bitter, and then %0aagain fresh, the same taking place as many times during the %0anight. It is full, he says, of white serpents, twenty cubits %0along. 59 He mentions, also, a certain spring in Arabia, which %0arises from the ground with such remarkable force, as to throw %0aback any object pressed down upon it, however weighty. %0a%0aCUAP. 16. — WATERS WHICH THROW UP STONES. WATERS WHICH %0a%0aCAUSE LAUGHTER AND WEEPING. WATERS WHICH ARE SAID %0a%0aTO BE CURATIVE OF LOVE. %0a%0aTheophrastus makes mention of the fountain of Marsyas, %0a%0acompares it to the miracle of the blood of St. Januarius at Naples. The %0acontrivance of the priests of Bel was not very dissimilar; but in their %0acase, they themselves were the real recipients of what the god was supposed %0ato devour. %0a%0aA He no doubt alludes to “petroleum,” rock-oil, or Barbadoes tar. %0a%0a55 So called from the Greek \inupbg, “ unctuous.” %0a%0a58 A new reading given by Sillig in place of “India,” the former one. %0aTasitia is the name of a district mentioned by Ptolemy, iv. 7, 15, as being %0ain --Ethiopia. He alludes to a burning spring, probably, of naphtha or of %0apetroleum. The burning springs of Bakou in the East are well known. %0aGenoa is lighted with naphtha from the village of Amiano, in Parma. %0a%0aIn Macedonia. 58 “ Lacum insanura.” %0a%0a39 Juba has been deceived, Ajasson remarks, by the tales of travellers, %0athere being no serpents of this length in Africa, except boas. He thinks %0athat large congers, and other similar fishes, may be the animals really %0aalluded to. %0a%0a%0aChap. 18.] FACTS CONNECTED WITH WATER. 479 %0a%0anear the city of Celaenoe, in Phrygia, which throws up masses %0aof stone. Not far from it are two other springs, called Clseon 60 %0aand Gelon by the Greeks, from the effects which they re¬ %0aspectively produce. At Cyzicus is a fountain known as that %0aof Cupido, the waters of which, Mucianus believes, 61 cure those %0awho drink thereof of love. %0a%0aCHAP. 17.—WATERS WHICH PRESERVE THEIR WARMTH FOR THREE %0aDATS. %0a%0aAt Crannon 6 - there are certain hot springs, though not at %0aboiling heat, the water of which, mixed with wine, preserves %0ait warm in the vessels for a period of three days. The same is %0athe case, too, with the springs of Mattiacum 63 in Germany, %0abeyond the river Rhenus, the water of which retains its boil¬ %0aing heat three days. The margin of these springs is covered %0awith pumice, formed by the action of the water. %0a%0aCHAP. 18. -OTHER MARVELLOUS FACTS CONNECTED WITH WATER. %0a%0aWATERS IN WHICH EVERYTHING WILL SINK. WATERS IN WHICH %0a%0aNOTHING WILL SINK. %0a%0aIf any of the above-mentioned facts have the appearance %0aof being incredible to a person, I would have him know that %0athere is no department of Nature which presents greater mar¬ %0avels than this, independently of the numerous peculiarities %0awhich have befen already mentioned 64 in an earlier part of this %0awork. Ctesias informs us that, in India, there is a lake of %0astanding water, upon which nothing 65 will float, every object %0ainstantly sinking to the bottom. Cselius says that in the %0a■waters of Lake Avernus, 66 in our own part of the world, the' %0avery leaves of the trees even will sink; and, according to %0aVarro, these waters are fatal to such birds as fly towards them. %0a%0aOn the other hand, again, in the waters of Lake Apuscida- %0amus, 67 in Africa, nothing will sink ; the same, too, Apion tells %0a%0a60 From eXatuv, “to weep,” and ytXpV, “to laugh.” %0a%0a61 His credulity, we have seen already, was pretty extensive. %0a%0a62 In Thessaly. %0a%0a63 At the town called “ Aquae Mattiacrc,” the modern Wiesbaden. %0a%0a64 In B. ii. c. 100. %0a%0a63 Sotion, professing to quote from Ctesias, says that it rejected everything %0aplaced on its waters, and hurled it back upon dry land. %0a%0a66 Whence, as it was said, its name, uo^voq, “ Without birds.” Strabo %0aridicules this story. _ . . %0a%0a« M. Douvillc says that in the interior of Africa there is a lake called %0a%0a%0a480 %0a%0a%0apliny’s natural history. %0a%0a%0a[Book xxxr. %0a%0a%0aus, with the fountain of Plinthia in Sicily, as also a certain %0alake in Media, and the well of Saturn. The spring ot Li- %0amyra 68 not unfrequently makes its way through the neigh¬ %0abouring localities, and when it does so, is always portentous of %0asome coming event. It is a singular thing too, that the fish %0aalways accompany its waters on these occasions; the inha¬ %0abitants of the adjoining districts being in the habit of consult¬ %0aing them by offering them food. When the fishes seize it witli %0aavidity, the answer is supposed to be favourable ; but if, on the %0aother hand, they reject the food, by flapping it with their tails, %0athe response is considered to be unfavourable. The river %0aHolcas, in Bithynia, runs close to Bryazus, 69 the name of a %0atemple and of a divinity there worshipped ; persons guilty of %0aperjury, it is said, cannot endure contact with its waters, %0awhich burn like flame. 10 %0a%0aThe sources, too, of the Tamaricus, 71 a river of Cantabria, %0aare considered to possess certain powers of presaging future %0aevents : they are three in number, and, separated solely by an %0ainterval of eight feet, unite in one channel, and so form a mighty %0astream. These springs are often dry a dozen times in the day, %0asometimes as many as twenty, without there being the slight¬ %0aest trace of water there: while, on the other hand, a spring %0aclose at hand is flowing abundantly and without intermission. %0aIt is considered an evil presage when persons who wish to see %0athese springs find them dry : a circumstance which happened %0avery recently, for example, to Lartius Licinius, 12 who held the %0aoffice of legatus after his praetorship ; for at the end of seven %0adays after his visit he died. %0a%0aIn Judaea there is a river 73 that is dry every Sabbath day. %0a%0aCHAP. 19.- DEADLY WATERS.

Ctesias states in his writings, that there %0ais a spring in Armenia, the fishes in which are black, 74 and, if %0aused as food, productive of instantaneous death. I have heard %0athe same, too, with reference to the waters near the sources %0aof the river Danuvius, 75 until a spring is reached which is %0anear its main channel, and beyond which this poisonous kind %0aof fish is not to be found. Hence it is that this spot is gene¬ %0arally looked upon as the source of the river. The same, too, is %0areported of the Lake of the Nymphs, in Lydia. Near the river %0aPheneus, in Achaia, there flows from the rocks a spring known %0aas the Styx, the waters of which, as already 76 stated, are in¬ %0astantly fatal. And not only this, but there are also small fish %0ain it, Theophrastus says, which are as deadly as the water, %0aa thing that is not the case with the fish of any other poison¬ %0aous springs. Theopompus says, that at the town of Cychri, %0ain Thrace, the waters are deadly; and Lycus states, that at %0aLeontium 77 there is a spring, the waters of which are fatal at %0athe end of a couple of days to those who drink thereof. Yarro %0aspeaks also of a spring upon Mount Soracte, some four feet in %0abreadth, the waters of which bubble forth at sunrise, as though %0athey were boiling; birds, he says, which only taste thereof, %0afall dead close by. %0a%0aAnd then, besides, we meet with this insidious circumstance, %0athat in some cases, waters of this nature are inviting even in %0atheir appearance ; those at Nonacris, in Arcadia, for example, %0athe water of which fountain possesses no apparent quality to %0aexcite mistrust, though, owing to its intense coldness, it is %0agenerally looked upon as highly injurious, seeing that it petri¬ %0afies as it flows. It is otherwise with the waters of Tempe, %0ain Thessaly, their baneful properties inspiring universal terror, %0aand possessing the property of corroding copper even and %0airon, it is said. This stream runs a short distance only, as %0aalready stated ; 78 and it is truly marvellous that, according %0ato general report, the banks of its source 79 are surrounded with %0athe roots of a wild carob, 80 always covered with purple flowers, %0a%0a74 Ajasson thinks that he means, grey. He remarks also, that it is a %0amatter of doubt whether there are any fishes that are poisonous. %0a%0a75 The Danube. • 76 In B. ii. c. 106, see also B. xxx. c. 53. %0a%0a' 71 Sec B. iii. c. 14, and B. xviii. c. 21. %0a%0a78 In B. iv. c. 15. %0a%0a79 He alludes, according to Dalechamps, to the Eurotas, a tributary, and %0a%0anot the source, of the Peneus.

At Eury- %0amenae, 83 chaplets, when thrown into the waters of a certain foun¬ %0atain there, are turned to stone. At Colossae there is a river, into %0athe water of which if bricks 84 are thrown, when taken out they %0aare found changed into stone. In the mines of Scyros, the trees %0apetrify that are watered by the river, branches and all. In %0athe caverns of Mount Corycus, the drops of water that trickle %0adown the rocks become hard in the form of a stone. 85 At %0aMieza, too, in Macedonia, the water petrifies as it hangs from %0athe vaulted roofs of the rocks; but at Corycus it is only when %0ait has fallen that it becomes hard. %0a%0aIn other caverns, again, the water petrifies both ways, 86 and %0aso forms columns; as we find the case in a vast grotto at Phau- %0asia, a town of the Chersonesus 87 of the Rhodians, the columns %0aof which are tinted with various colours. These instances will %0asuffice for the present. %0a%0aCHAP. 21. (3.)-THE WHOLESOMENESS OF WATERS. %0a%0aIt is a subject of enquiry among medical men, which kind %0aof tvater is the most beneficial. They condemn, and with I %0ajustice, all stagnant, sluggish, waters, and are of opinion that* %0arunning water is the best, being rendered lighter and more %0a%0a81 A town of Mysia, south of Adramyttium. %0a%0a82 As Ajasson remarks, numerous instances are known of this at the %0apresent day. Pliny, however, does not distinguish the intrusting springs %0afrom the petrifying springs. %0a%0a63 In Thessaly, according to Hecatseus. %0a%0a81 “ LatereS-.P He means unburnt bricks, probably. %0a%0a85 He alludes to stalactites and stalagmites. %0a%0a85 Both on the roof and on the floor. %0a%0a*' In Caria, opposite Rhodes. %0a%0a%0aWH0LES0MEITE8S OF WATEHS. %0a%0a%0a483 %0a%0a%0aChap. 21.] %0a%0asalubrious by its current and its continuous agitation. Hence it %0ais that I am much surprised that persons should be found to %0aset so high a value as they do, upon cistern water. These lasW %0agive as their reason, however, that rain-water must be the %0alightest water of all, seeing that it has been able to rise 8S aloft ^ %0aand remain suspended in the air. Hence it is, too, that they %0aprefer snow-water to rain-water, and ice, again, to snow, as * %0abeing water subtilized to the highest possible degree ; on the %0aground that snow-water and ice-water must be lighter than %0aordinary water, and ice, of necessity, considerably lighter. It %0ais for the general interest, however, of mankind, that these %0anotions should be refuted. Tor, in the first place, this com¬ %0aparative lightness which they speak of, could hardly be ascer¬ %0atained in any other way than by the sensation, there being %0apretty nearly no difference at all in weight between the kinds of %0awater. Hor yet, in the case of rain-water, is it any proof of %0aits lightness that it has made its way upwards into the air, %0aseeing that stones," it is quite evident, do the same : and then, %0abesides, this water, while falling, must of necessity become %0atainted with the vapours which rise from the earth ; a circum¬ %0astance owing to which it is, that such numerous impurities 90 %0aare to be detected in rain-water, and that it ferments 91 with %0asuch extreme rapidity. %0a%0aI am, surprised, too, that snow 92 and ice should be regarded %0aas the most subtilized states of this element, in juxtaposition %0awith the proofs supplied us by hail, the water of which, it is %0agenerally agreed, is the most pernicious of all to drink. And %0athen, besides, there are not a few among the medical men %0athemselves, who assert that the use of ice-water and snow¬ %0awater is highly injurious, from the circumstance that all the %0amore refined parts thereof have been expelled by congelation. %0a%0aAt all events, it is a well-ascertained fact that the volume of %0aevery liquid is diminished by congelation; as also that exces- %0a%0aRain-water really is the lightest, but the reason here given is frivolous, %0afor it does not ascend as water, but as vapour. %0a%0a89 See B. ii. c. 38. Before venturing on this argument, he should have %0abeen certain as to the circumstances under which aerolites are generated, a %0aquestion which still remains hidden in mystery. _ %0a%0aw Ajasson remarks that this is only the case in the water of heavy falls %0aof rain after long drought. 91 “Calefiat.” %0a%0a92 Snow-water is pernicious in a very high degree, being the fruitful %0asource of goitre and cretinism. %0a%0aI I 2 %0a%0a%0a484 %0a%0a%0aprint's natural itistory. %0a%0a%0a[Book XXXI. %0a%0a%0asive dews 93 * a reproductive of blight in com, and that hoar¬ %0afrosts result in blast; of a kindred nature, both of them to %0asnow. It is generally agreed, too, that rain-water putrefies %0awith the greatest rapidity, and that it keeps but very badly on %0aa voyage. Epigenes, however, assures us that water which %0ahas putrefied seven times and as often purified 93 itself, will no %0alonger be liable to putrefaction. As to cistern-water, medical %0amen assure us that, owing to its harshness, it is bad for the %0abowels and throat ; w and it is generally admitted by them that %0athere is no kind of water that contains more slime or more %0anumerous insects of a disgusting nature. Hut it does not, %0atherefore, follow that river water is the best of all, or that, in %0afact, of any running stream, the water of many lakes being %0afound to be wholesome in the very highest degree. %0a%0aWhat water, then, out of all these various kinds, are we to %0alook upon as best adapted for the human constitution ? Dif¬ %0aferent kinds in different localities, is my answer^/The kings %0aof Parthia drink no water but that of the Choaspes 95 or of the %0aEulseus, and, however long their joumies, they always have %0athis water carried in their suite. And yet it is very evident , %0athat it is not merely because this water is river-water that it* %0ais thus pleasing to them, seeing that they decline to drink the %0awater of the Tigris, Euphrates, and so many other streams. %0a%0aCHAP. 22.-THE IMPURITIES OF WATER. %0a%0aSlime 96 is one great impurity of water: still, however, if a %0ariver of this description is full of eels, it is generally looked %0aupon as a proof 97 of the salubrity of its water; just as it is %0aregarded as a sign of its freshness when long worms 98 breed in %0athe water of a spring. But it is bitter water, more particu¬ %0alarly, that is held in disesteem, as also the water which swells %0athe stomach the moment it is drunk, a property which belongs %0a%0a9s* See B. xvii. c. 44, and B. xviii. c. 68. %0a%0a93 This is somewhat similar to what is said of the putrefaction and %0apurification of Thames water, on a voyage. %0a%0a94 “ Inutilis alvo duritia faucibusque.” The passage is probably corrupt. %0a%0a95 See B. vi. c. 27. %0a%0a96 Or “ mud ”—“ limus.” All rivers of necessity have it, in a greater or %0aless degree. %0a%0a97 On the contrary, the more the mud and slime, the more numerous the %0a%0aeels, 99 “lamias.” %0a%0a%0aChap. 23.] %0a%0a%0aMODES OP TESTING WATEB. %0a%0a%0a485 %0a%0a%0ato the water at Troezen. As to the nitrous 99 and salso-acid 1 %0a•waters which are found in the deserts, persons travelling across %0atowards the Red Sea render them potable in a couple of hours %0aby the addition of polenta, which they use also as food. %0aThose springs are more particularly condemned which secrete %0amud, 2 or which give a bad complexion to persons who drink %0athereof. It is a good plan, too, to observe if water leaves %0astains upon copper vessels; if leguminous vegetables boil with %0adifficulty in it; if, when gently decanted, it leaves an earthy %0adeposit; or if, when boiled, it covers the vessel with a thick %0acrust. 3 %0a%0aIt is a fault also in water, 3 * not only to have a bad smell, 4 %0abut to have any flavour 5 at all, even though it be. a flavour %0apleasant and agreeable in itself, or closely approaching, as we %0aoften find the case, the taste of milk. Water, to be truly %0awholesome, ought to resemble air G as much as possible. . There %0ais only one 7 spring of water in the whole universe, it is said, %0athat has an agreeable smell, that ot Chabura, namely, in Me¬ %0asopotamia : the people give a fabulous reason tor it, and say %0athat it is because Juno 8 bathed there.

There is, however, a more certain mode %0aof ascertaining the difference in quality, that water being the %0abetter of the two which becomes hot and cold with the greatest %0arapidity : in addition to which, not to keep poising a balance , 10 %0aafter w r ater has been drawn up in vessels, if it is good, it should %0agradually become warmer, they say, when placed upon the %0aground. Which xvater, then, of the several kinds will be %0amost likely to be good and wholesome ? Well-water, no doubt/ %0aif we are to judge from the general use made of it in cities: %0abut only in the case of wells in which it is kept in continual %0aagitation by repeated drawing, and is refined by the earth acting^ %0aas a filter. These conditions are sufficient to ensure salubrity %0ain water : in regard to coolness, the well must be in a shaded* %0aspot, and the water kept exposed to the air. There is, however, %0aone thing above all to be observed, a point, too, of considerable %0aimportance with reference to the continuance of the flow—the %0aspring must issue from the bed of the well, and not from the * %0asides. To make water cold to the touch may be effected arti¬ %0aficially even, either by forcing it to rise aloft or by making it %0afall from a height, and so come in collision with the air, and be¬ %0acome incorporated * 1 therewith: for in swimming , 12 we find, %0awhen we hold our breath, the water is felt to be all the colder. %0a%0aIt was the Emperor Nero’s invention 13 to boil water, and*' %0a%0aVxhen enclose it in glass vessels and cool it in snow ; a method %0awhich ensures all the enjoyment of a cold beverage, without any %0aof the inconveniences resulting from the use of snow. Indeed, it %0ais generally admitted that all water is more 14 wholesome when %0a%0avery impure water. Synesius, Ep. xv., gives an account of the “ hydros- %0acopium ” used by the ancients for ascertaining the weight of water. Beck¬ %0amann enters into a lengthy examination of it, as also an enquiry into the %0aquestion whether the ancients, and among them Pliny, were acquainted %0awith the hydrometer. See his Hist. Inv. Yol. II. pp. 163—169. Bohn's Ed. %0a%0aly “ Ne manus pendeaijt.” These words, which Hardouin pronounces %0ato be full of obscurity, have caused considerable discussion. The passage %0aappears to be imperfect, but it is not improbable that he alludes to the use %0aot the balance or scales for ascertaining the comparative wholesomeness of %0awater. . _ 11 “ Corripiat.” %0a%0aThe thread of his reasoning is not very perceptible; but he seems to %0amean that the more air there is in a body the colder it is. If the air is %0ainhaled by a person when eating peppermint, he will be sensible of a cold %0afeeling in the mouth. %0a%0a* 13 Galen believes this method to have been known to Hippocrates, and %0a%0aAristotle was undoubtedly acquainted with it. See Beckmann’s Hist. Inv. %0aVol. II. pp. 143-4. Bohn's Ed. %0a%0a14 This is not at all the opinion at the present day. %0a%0a%0aChap. 24.] %0a%0a%0aTILE MABCIAH WATERS. %0a%0a%0a487 %0a%0a%0ait has been boiled ; as also, that water when it has once been %0aheated, will become more intensely 15 cold than before—a most %0aingenious discovery . 16 The best corrective of unwholesome %0awater is to boil it down to one half. Cold water, taken inter¬ %0anally, arrests haemorrhage.By keeping cold water in his %0amouth, a person may render himself proof against the intense %0aheat of the bath. Many a person knows by his own every-day %0aexperience, that water which is the coldest to drink is not of %0anecessity the coldest to the touch, this delightful property being %0asubject to considerable fluctuations . 17 %0a%0aCHAP. 24 .- THE MAECIAN WATEES. %0a%0aThe most celebrated water throughout the whole world, and %0athe one to which our city gives the palm for coolness and salu¬ %0abrity, is that of the Marcian 18 Spring, accorded to Home among %0athe other bounties of the gods : the name formerly given to %0athe stream was the “ Aufeian,” the spring itself being known %0aas “ Pitonia.” It rises ’ 9 at the extremity of the mountains of %0athe Peligni, passes through the territory of the Marsi and through %0aLake Fucinus, and then, without deviating, makes directly for %0aRome : shortly after this, it loses itself iu certain caverns, and %0aonly reappears in the territory of Tibur, from which it is %0abrought to the City by an arched aqueduct nine miles in %0alength. Ancus Marcius, one of the Roman kings, was the %0afirst 20 who thought cf introducing this water into the City. %0aAt a later period, the vorks were repaired by Quintus Mar¬ %0acius Rex: and, more recently, in his praetorship, by M. %0aAgrippa . 21 %0a%0a15 “ Magis refrigerari.” The experiments made by Mariotte, Perrault, %0athe Academy del Cimento, Mariana,and others, showed no perceptible differ¬ %0aence in the time of freezing, betweei boiled and unboiled water; but the %0aformer produced ice harder and clearer, the latter ice more full of blisters. %0aIn later times, Dr. Black, of Edinburgh has from his experiments asserted %0athe contrary. “ Boiled water,” he says, “ becomes ice sooner than unboiled, %0aif the latter be left at perfect rest.” Becknann’s Hist.

Near these %0awaters is the stream of Hercules, which the former shun, to %0aall appearance, and have thence obtained 23 the name of “Virgin %0aWaters.” On instituting a comparison between the waters of %0athese streams, the difference above-mentioned 24 may be imme¬ %0adiately detected, the Virgin water being as much cooler to %0athe touch, as the Marcian water is in taste. And yet, for this %0along time past, the pleasure of drinking these waters has been %0alost to the City, owing to the ambition and avarice of certain %0apersons who have turned 25 them out of their course for the %0asupply of their country-seats and of various places in the suburbs, %0ato the great detriment of the public health. %0a%0a%0aCHAP. 26 . -THE METHOD OF SEARCHING FOR WATER. %0a%0a%0aIt will not be out of place to append here an account of the %0amethod employed in searching for water. Water is mostly to %0aN be found in valleys, whether formed by the intersection of de¬ %0aclivities or lying at the lower part of mountaias. Many per¬ %0asons have been of opinion that all places with a northern 36 %0aaspect are naturally provided with water: a point upon which %0ait will not be amiss to explain the diversities presented to us %0aby Nature. On the south side of the mountains of Ilyrcania %0ait never rains; and hence it is that it is only on the north¬ %0aeast side that they are wooded. As for Olympus, Ossa, Par¬ %0anassus, the Apennines, and the Alps, they are covered with %0awood on every side, and abundantly watered with streams. %0aSome mountains, again, are wooded on the south side, the %0aWhite 27 Mountains in Crete, /or example. On this point, %0atherefore, we may come to th* conclusion that there is no rule %0awhich in all cases holds good %0a%0a%0a23 ‘‘Aqua Virgo.” This aqivduct, erected a.u.c. 735, stiU exists, and %0abears the name of “ Aqua Verpne. ’ %0a%0a23 Another story was, that i had this name from the circumstance that %0athe spring was first pointed oitby a girl to some soldiers in search of water. %0a** In c. 23 of this Book. %0a%0a25 This was only temporsrily, in all probability %0a%0a“ I here ) , S !, CI ? 8 ' a8he sa/S bel0 I’ . t0 be D0 general rule as to this point. %0a** bo called from the srow on their summit. ^ %0a%0a%0aChap. 28.] %0a%0a%0aDIFFERENCES Ilf WATEE8. %0a%0a%0a489 %0a%0a%0aCHAP. 27 . -SIGNS INDICATIVE OF THE PRESENCE OF WATER. %0a%0aThe following are indications of the presence of water :—■ %0arushes, reeds, the plant mentioned with reference to this point %0aalready , 28 or frogs sitting squatted on a spot for a long time %0atogether. As to the wild 29 willow, alder, vitex, reed, and ivy, %0aall of which grow spontaneously on low grounds in which %0athere is a settling of rain water from higher localities, con¬ %0asidered as indications of the presence of water, they are all 30 of %0athem of a deceptive nature. A sign much more to be depended %0aupon, is a certain misty exhalation, visible from a distance %0abefore sunrise. The better to observe this, some persons ascend %0aan eminence, and lie flat at full length upon the ground, with %0athe chin touching the earth. There is also another peculiar %0amethod of judging upon this point, known only to men of %0aexperience in these matters : in the very middle of the heats %0aof summer they select the hottest hours of the day, and observe %0ahow the sun’s rays are reflected in each spot; and if, notwith¬ %0astanding the general dryness of the earth, a locality is observed %0ato present a moist appearance, they make no doubt of finding %0awater there. %0a%0aBut so intense is the stress upon the eyes in doing this, that %0ait is very apt to make them ache; to avoid which inconveni¬ %0aence, they have recourse to other modes of testing. They dig %0aa hole, for instance, some five feet in depth, and cover it with %0avessels of unbaked pottery, or with a copper basin well-oiled ; %0athey then place a burning lamp on the spot, with an arch-work %0aover it of leaves, and covered with earth on the top. If, after a %0atime, they find the pots wet or broken, the copper covered with %0amoisture, or the lamp extinguished, but not from want of oil, or %0aif a lock of wool that has been left there is found to be moist, %0ait is a sign of the presence of water, beyond all doubt. With %0asome persons it is the practice to light a fire on the spot before %0athey dig the hole, a method which renders the experiment with %0athe vessels still more conclusive. %0a%0aCHAP. 28.— DIFFERENCES IN WATERS, ACCORDING TO THE NATURE %0aOF THE SOIL. %0a%0aThe soil itself, too, gives indications of the presence of %0a%0a28 In B. xxvi. c. 16. 29 “ Salix erratica.” %0a%0a30 Surely not the reed, as he has mentioned it above as one of the in¬ %0adications to be depended upon.

The water is always fresh that is found %0ain argillaceous soils, but in a stratum of tufa it is colder than %0aelsewhere; this, indeed, being a soil which is highly approved %0aof, as having a tendency to make the water pure and extremely %0alight to the stomach, and, by its action as a filter, to Avithhold %0aall impurities. The presence of sand 33 gives indications of %0asprings of but limited extent, and of Avater impregnated with %0aslime; Avhile that of gravel announces the presence of water of %0aexcellent flavour, but not to be depended upon for permanence. %0aMale 33 sand, fine sea 3 ' 1 -sand, and charcoal 35 earth, yield a con¬ %0astant supply of water of a highly wholesome quality; but it %0ais the presence of red stones that is the most to be depended %0aupon, and the water found there is of the very finest quality. %0aCraggy localities at the foot of mountains, and silicious soils, %0aare equally good; in addition to which, the water found there %0ais cooler than elsewhere. %0a%0aIn boring for water, the soil should always become more %0aand more humid, and, the deeper the descent, with the greater %0afacility the implements should penetrate. In deep-sunk wells, %0athe presence of sulphureous 36 or aluminous substances is fatal %0ato the sinkers; a danger that may be guarded against by letting %0adown a lighted lamp, and ascertaining whether the flame is %0aextinguished. When such is found to be the case, it is the %0apractice to sink vent-holes on each side of the well, both right %0aand left, in order to receive and carry off the noxious exhala¬ %0ations. Independently of these evils, the air becomes heavier, %0afrom the great depth merely of the excavation, an inconvenience %0awhich is remedied by keeping up a continual circulation with %0aventilators of linen cloth. As soon as water is reached, walls %0a%0a31 “ Cork.” 3i u Sabulum.’-’ %0a%0a33 “ Sabulum masculum.” Coarse, reddish sand, Dalechamps says. %0a%0a34 “Arena.” 35 See B. xvii. c. 3. %0a%0a36 An inconvenience neutralized in a considerable degree by Davy’s in¬ %0avention of the safety-lamp. %0a%0a%0aChap. 29.] QUALITIES OF WATEB. 491 %0a%0aare constructed at the bottom, but without cement,* 7 in order %0athat the springs may not be intercepted. %0a%0aSome -waters, the sources of which do not lie on elevated %0aground, are coldest at the beginning of spring, being main¬ %0atained by the winter rains in fact. Others, again, are coldest at %0athe rising of the Dog-star—peculiarities, both of them, to be %0awitnessed at Pella in Macedonia ; for in front of that city there %0ais a marsh-spring, which at the beginning of summer is cold, %0awhile in the more elevated parts of the city the water is ice- %0acold 38 in the hottest days of summer. The same is the case, %0atoo, at Chios, the water-supply of the harbour and of the %0acity occupying the same relative positions. At Athens, the %0awater of the Fountain Enneacrunos 39 is colder in a cloudy %0asummer than the well there in the garden of Jupiter; while %0aon the other hand, this last is ice-cold during the drought of a %0ahot summer. For the most part, however, wells are coldest %0aabout the rising of Arcturus. 10 %0a%0a(4.) The water-supply of wells never fails in summer, but %0ain all cases it falls low during four days at the rising of the %0aconstellation above-mentioned. Throughout the whole winter, %0aon the other hand, many wells entirely fail; as in the neigh¬ %0abourhood of Olynthus, for example, where the water returns %0ain the early days of spring. In Sicily too, in the vicinity of %0aMessana and Mylae, the springs are entirely dry throughout %0athe winter, while in summer they overflow and form quite a %0ariver. At Apollonia in Pontus there is to be seen, near the %0asea-shore, a fountain which overflows in summer only, and %0amostly about the rising of the Dog-star; should the summer, %0ahowever, not be so hot as usual, its water is less abundant. %0aCertain soils become drier in consequence of rain, that in the %0aterritory of Narnia for example : a fact which M. Cicero has %0amentioned in his “ Admiranda,” with a statement that drought %0ais there productive of mud, and rain of dust. 41 %0a%0aCHAP. 29. -THE QUALITIES OF WATEB AT THE DIFFERENT SEASONS %0a%0aOF THE TEAR. %0a%0aEvery kind of water is freshest in winter, not so fresh in %0a37 “ Arenatum.” Properly a mortar, which consisted of one part lime %0aand two parts sand. 38 “ Riget.” %0a%0a39 See B. iv. c. 11.

For the quality of water, in fact, depends upon the %0anature of the soil through which it flows, and the juices 12 of %0athe vegetation watered by it; hence it is that the water of the %0asame river is found in some spots to be comparatively un¬ %0awholesome. The confluents, too, of rivers, are apt to change the %0aflavour of the water, impregnating the stream in which they %0aare lost and absorbed; as in the case of the Borysthenes, for %0aexample. In some instances, again, the taste of river-water is %0achanged by the fall of heavy rains. It has happened three %0atimes in the Bosporus that there has been a fall of salt rain, a %0aphaenomenon which proved fatal to the crops. On three occa¬ %0asions, also, the rains have imparted a bitterness to the over¬ %0aflowing streams of the Nilus, which was productive of great %0apestilence throughout Egypt. %0a%0aCHAP. 30. -HISTORICAL observations upon waters which have %0a%0aSUBBENLY MABE THEIR APPEARANCE OR SUBBENLY CEA8EB. %0a%0aIt frequently happens that in spots where forests have been %0afelled, springs of water make 13 their appearance, the supply of %0awhich was previously expended in the nutriment of the trees. %0aThis was the case upon Mount Heemus for example, when, %0aduring the siege by Cassander, 11 the Gauls cut down a forest %0afor the purpose of making a rampart. Very often too, after %0aremoving the wood which has covered an elevated spot and %0aso served to attract and consume the rains, devastating torrents %0aare formed by the concentration of the waters. It is very im¬ %0aportant also, for the maintenance of a constant supply of %0awater, to till the ground and keep it constantly in motion, %0ataking care to break and loosen the callosities of the surface %0acrust: at all events, we find it stated, that upon a city of %0aCrete, Arcadia by name, being razed to the ground, the springs %0aand water-courses, which before were very numerous in that %0alocality, all at once dried up ; but that, six years after, when %0a%0a43 See B. ii. c. 106. %0a%0a43 Ajasson remarks, that just the converse of this has been proved by %0amodern experience to be the case. %0a%0a44 The son of Antipater, then acting for Alexander during his absence %0ain the East. %0a%0a%0aChap. 30.] WATERS WHICH HAVE SUDDENLY APPEARED. 493 %0a%0athe city was rebuilt, the water again made its appearance, just %0aas each spot was again brought into cultivation. %0a%0a(5.) Earthquakes also are apt to discover or swallow 45 up %0asprings of water; a thiDg that has happened, it is well known, %0aon five different occasions in the vicinity of Pheneus, a town of %0aArcadia. So too, upon Mount Corycus, 46 a river burst forth ; %0aafter which, the soil was subjected to cultivation. These %0achanges are very surprising where there is no apparent cause %0afor them; such as the occurrence at Magnesia, 47 for instance, %0awhere the warm waters became cold, but without losing their %0abrackish flavour; and at the Temple 4 * of Neptune in Cana, %0awhere the water of the river, from being fresh, became salt. %0aHere, too, is another fact, replete with the marvellous—the %0afountain of Arethusa at Syracuse has a smell of dung, they say, %0aduring the celebration of the games at Olympia, 49 a thing that %0ais rendered not improbable by the circumstance, 50 that the river %0aAlpheus makes its way to that island beneath the bed of the %0asea. There is a spring in the Chersonesus of the lthodians 50 * %0awhich discharges its accumulated impurities every nine years. %0a%0aWaters, too, sometimes change their colour; as at Babylon, %0afor example, where the water of a certain lake for eleven days %0ain summer is red. In the summer season, too, the current of %0athe Borysthenes 51 is blue, it is said, and this, although its %0awaters are the most rarefied in existence, and hence float upon %0athe surface of those of the Hypanis ; 52 —though at the same time %0athere is this marvellous fact, that when south winds prevail, the %0awaters of the Hypanis assume the upper place. Another proof, %0atoo, of the surpassing lightness of the water of the Borysthenes, %0ais the fact that it emits no exhalations, nor indeed, the slightest %0avapour even. Authors that would have the credit of diligent %0aresearch in these enquiries, assure us that water becomes %0aheavier after the winter-solstice. %0a%0a« q R ii p 84 46 In Cilicia. %0a%0a47 Whether he means the district of Thessaly so called, or one of the %0atwo Pities of that uame in Lydia, does not appear to be known %0a18 Its locality is unknown, but it was probably near the sea-shore. %0a%0aZ Kis^Xlhy ' JSi by the popular story that the river Alpheus %0ain Peloponnesus, ^n its love for the Fountain W Are husa,penerated %0abeneath the bed of the sea, and reappeared in Sicily.

(6.) - THE METHOD OF CONVEYING WATER. %0a%0aThe most convenient method of making a watercourse from %0athe spring is by employing earthen pipes, two fingers in thick¬ %0aness, inserted in one another at the points of junction—the one %0athat has the higher inclination fitting into the lower one—and %0acoated with quick-lime macerated in oil. The inclination, to %0aensure the free flow of the water, ought to be at least one-fourth %0aof an inch to every hundred feet; and if the water is conveyed %0athrough a subterraneous passage, there should be air-holes let in %0aat intervals of every two 53 actus. Where the water is wanted %0ato ascend 34 aloft, it should be conveyed in pipes of lead: %0awater, it should be remembered, always rises to the level of its %0asource. If, again, it is conveyed from a considerable distance, %0ait should be made to rise and fall every now and then, so as %0anot to lose its motive pow r er. The proper length for each %0aleaden pipe is ten feet; and if 65 the pipe is five fingers in cir¬ %0acumference its weight should be sixty pounds; if eight feet, %0aone hundred ; if ten, one hundred and twenty ; and so on in the %0asame proportion. %0a%0aA pipe is called “a ten-finger” 56 pipe when the sheet of %0ametal is ten fingers in breadth before it is rolled up ; a sheet %0aone half that breadth giving a pipe “ of five fingers.” 5 ' In all %0asudden changes of inclination in elevated localities, pipes of %0afive fingers should be employed, in order to break the impetu¬ %0aosity of the fall: reservoirs, 68 too, for branches should be made %0aas circumstances may demand. %0a%0aCHAP. 32 —HOW MINEKAL WATERS SHOULD BE USED. %0a%0aI am surprised that Homer has made no 59 mention of hot %0asprings, when, on the other hand, he has so frequently intro¬ %0aduced the mention of warm baths: a circumstance from which %0awe may safely conclude that recourse was not had in his time %0ato mineral waters for their medicinal properties, a thing so %0auniversally the case at the present day. Waters impregnated %0a%0a53 See B. xviii. c. 3, and the Introduction to Yol.

This last operation, however, is com¬ %0amonly regarded as altogether foreign to the use of mineral baths; %0aand hence it is, that there is no situation in which men’s %0abodies are more exposed to the chances of disease, the head %0abecoming saturated with the intensity of the odours exhaled, %0aand Left exposed, perspiring as it is, to the coldness of the %0aatmosphere, while all the rest of the body is immersed in the %0a%0awater. 64 ... %0a%0aThere is another mistake, also, of a similar description, made %0aby those who pride themselves upon drinking enormous %0aquantities of these waters ; 65 and I myself have seen persons, %0abefore now, so swollen with drinking it that the very rings on %0atheir fingers were entirely concealed by the skin, owing to %0atheir inability to discharge the vast quantities of water which %0athey had swallowed. It is for this reason, too, that these %0awaters should never be drunk without taking a taste of salt %0aevery now and then. The very mud, n> too, ot mineral spiings %0amay be employed to good purpose; but, to be effectual, after %0abeing applied to the body, it must be left to dry in the sun. %0a%0aIt must not be supposed, however, that all hot waters are %0a%0a%0a60 Or rather, as Ajasson says, for cutaneous diseases. %0a%0a61 See B. iii. c. 17. . %0a%0a62 In conformity with Sillig’s suggestion, we reject “ atque as an in- %0a%0aJ 63 Mulcenv %0a%0ate Ji i n spite of what Pliny says, in some cases the use of a mineral bath %0ais recommended for a long period of time together.

THE ADVANTAGES OP %0a%0aA SEA-VOYAGE. %0a%0aSea-water also is employed in a similar manner for the cure %0aof diseases. It is used, made hot, for the cure of pains in the %0asinews, for reuniting fractured bones, and for its desiccative %0aaction upon the body: for which last purpose, it is also used %0acold. There are numerous other medicinal resources derived %0afrom the sea ; the benefit of a sea-voyage, more particularly, %0ain cases of phthisis, as already 68 mentioned, and where patients %0aare suffering from hsemoptosis, as lately experienced, in our %0aown memory, by Annaeus Gallio, 69 at the close of his consul¬ %0aship : 70 for it is not for the purpose of visiting the country, that %0apeople so often travel to Egypt, but in order to secure the %0abeneficial results arising from a long sea-voyage. Indeed, the %0avery sea-sickness that is caused by the rocking of the vessel %0ato and fro, is good for many affections of the head, eyes, and %0achest, all those cases, in fact, in which the patient is recom¬ %0amended to drink an infusion of hellebore. Medical men con¬ %0asider sea-water, employed by itself, highly efficacious for the %0adispersion of tumours, and, boiled with barley-meal, for the %0asuccessful treatment of imposthumes of the parotid glands : it %0ais used also as an ingredient in plasters, white plasters more %0aparticularly, and for emollient 71 poultices. Sea-water is very %0agood, too, employed as a shower-bath; and it is taken inter¬ %0anally, though not without 72 injury to the stomach, both as a %0a%0a67 See B. ii c. 106. %0a%0a68 In B. xxiv. c. 19, and B. xxviii. c. 14. %0a%0a63 An elder brother of the philosopher Seneca. • His original name was %0aM.

Some, again, are for %0aboiling it, but in all cases it is recommended to be taken from %0aout at sea, and untainted with the mixture of fresh water, an %0aemetic also being taken before using it. When used in this %0amanner, vinegar or wine is generally mixed with the water. %0aThose who give it unmixed, recommend radishes with oxymel %0ato be eaten upon it, in order to provoke vomiting. Sea-water, %0amade hot, is used also as an injection; and there is nothing in %0aexistence preferred to it as a fomentation for swellings of the %0atestes, or for chilblains before they ulcerate. It is similarly %0aemployed, also, for the cure of prurigo, itch-scab, and lichens. %0aLice and other foul vermin of the head, are removed by the %0aapplication of sea-water, and lividities of the skin are restored %0ato their natural colour; it being a remarkably good plan, in %0asuch cases, after applying the sea-water, to foment the parts %0awith hot vinegar. %0a%0aIt is generally considered, too, that sea-water is highly %0aefficacious for the stings of venomous insects, those of the pha- %0alangium and scorpion, for example, and as an antidote to the %0apoisonous secretions of the asp, known as the “ ptyas ;”' 5 in all %0awhich cases it is employed hot. Fumigations are also made of %0ait, with vinegar, for the cure of head-ache; and, used warm as %0aan injection, it allays griping pains in the bowels and cholera. %0aThings that have been heated in sea-water are longer than %0aordinary in cooling. A sea-water bath is an excellent cor¬ %0arective for swelling 76 of the bosoms in females, afiections of %0athe thoracic organs, and emaciation of the body. The steam %0aalso of sea-water boiled with vinegar, is used for the removal %0aof hardness of hearing and head-ache. An application of %0asea-water very expeditiously removes rust upon iron; it is %0a%0a%0a73 It is still considered useful, Ajasson says, for the treatment of lym¬ %0aphatic diseases. %0a%0a74 “Virus.” 75 Or “spitter.” See B. xxvni. c. 18. %0a%0a76 “ Mammas sororiautes.” A malady, according to Dalechamps, in %0awhich the mamillm are so distended with milk that they kiss, like sisteis %0a—“ sororcs.” %0a%0aVOL.

It is a singular fact in con¬ %0anexion with this discovery, that if more than one sextarius of %0asalt is put into four sextarii of water, the liquefying proper¬ %0aties of the water will be overpowered, and the salt will no %0alonger melt. On the other hand, again, a mixture of one sex¬ %0atarius of salt with four sextarii of water, acts as a good substi¬ %0atute for the efficacy and properties of the very saltest sea-water. %0aThe most reasonable proportion, however, is generally thought %0ato he eight cyathi of salt, diluted in the quantity of water %0aabove mentioned; a preparation which has been found to %0ahave a warming effect upon the sinews, without in any degree %0achafing the body. %0a%0aCHAP. 35.- HOW THALASSOMELI IS MADE. %0a%0aThere is also a composition made to ripen for use, known as %0a“ thalassomeli,” 78 and prepared with equal parts of sea-water, %0ahoney, and rain-water. For this purpose, also, the water is %0abrought from out at sea, and the preparation is kept in an %0aearthen vessel well pitched. It acts most efficiently as a pur¬ %0agative, and without in the least fatiguing the stomach; the %0ataste, too, and smell of it, are very agreeable. %0a%0aCHAP. 36.- HOW HYDROMELI IS MADE. %0a%0aHydromeli, 79 also, was a mixture formerly made with pure %0arain-water and honey, and was prescribed for patients who %0awere anxious for wine, as being a more harmless drink. For %0athese many years past, however, it has been condemned, as %0ahaving in reality all the inconveniences of wine, without thw %0aadvantages. %0a%0a77 The ancients being unable to analyze sea-water, could only imitate it %0avery clumsily. 79 “ Sea-water honey.” %0a%0a,9 See B. xiv. c. 20, and B. xxii. c. 51.

Fleeces are spread round the ship, and on %0abecoming moistened with the exhalations arising from the sea, %0athe water is wrung from them, and found to be quite fresh. %0aHollow balls of wax, also, or empty vessels sealed at the mouth, %0aupon being let down into the sea in a net, become filled with %0awater that is fresh and potable. On shore, too, sea-water may %0abe made fresh, by filtering it through argillaceous earth. %0a%0aBy swimming in water of any kind, sprains of the limbs in %0aman or beast are reduced 80 with the greatest facility. Persons %0awhen travelling, are sometimes apprehensive that the use of %0awater, the quality of which is unknown to them, may prove %0ainjurious to their health : as a precaution against this, they %0ashould drink the suspected water cold, immediately after leaving %0athe bath. %0a%0aCHAT. 38.- SIX REMEDIES DERIVED FRO^I MOSS. REMEDIES %0a%0aDERIVED FROM SAND. %0a%0aMoss which has grown in water 81 is excellent as a topical %0aapplication for gout; and, in combination with oil, it is good %0afor pains and swellings in the ankles. The foam that floats w %0aupon the surface of the water, used as a friction, causes warts %0ato disappear. The sand , 83 too, of the sea-shore, that more %0aparticularly which is very fine and burnt white by the heat of %0athe sun, is used remedially for its desiccative properties, the %0abodies of dropsical or rheumatic patients being entirely covered %0awith it. %0a%0aThus much with reference to water itself; we will now %0aturn to the aquatic productions, beginning, as in all other %0ainstances, with the principal of them, namely, salt and sponge. %0a%0a80 The joints being rendered more supple thereby. %0a%0a81 He probably means sed-water, alluding to certain kinds of sea-weed. %0aDioscorides speaks of it, in B. iv. c. 99, as being good for gout.

(7.)— the various kinds of salt; the methods op %0a%0aPREPARING IT, AND THE REMEDIES DERIVED FROM IT. TWO %0a%0aHUNDRED AND FOUR OBSERVATIONS THEREUPON. %0a%0aAll salt is either native or artificial ; 81 both kinds being %0aformed in various ways, but produced from one of these two %0acauses, the condensation or the desiccation, of a liquid . 84 The %0aLake of Tarentum is dried up by the heat of the summer sun, %0aand the whole of its waters, which are at no time very deep, %0anot higher than the knee in fact, are changed into one muss %0aof salt. The same, too, with a lake in Sicily, Cocanicus by %0aname, and another in the vicinity of Gela. But in the case of %0athese two last, it is only the sides 86 that are thus dried up ; %0awhereas in Phrygia, in Cappadocia, and at Aspendus, where %0athe same phaenomena are observable, the water is dried up to %0aa much larger extent, to the very middle of the lake, in fact. %0aThere is also another marvellous 87 circumstance connected with %0athis last—however much salt is taken out of it in the day, its %0aplace is supplied again during the night. Every kind of lake- %0asalt is found in grains, and not in the form of blocks . 88 %0a%0aSea-water, again, spontaneously produces another kind of %0asalt, from the foam which it leaves on shore at high-water %0amark, or adhering to rocks; this being, in all cases, condensed %0aby the action of the sun, and that 89 salt being the most pun¬ %0agent of the two which is found upon the rocks. %0a%0aThere are also three different kinds of native salt. In Bac- %0atriana there are two vast lakes ; 90 one of them situate on the side %0a%0a84 “ Sal fit.” This expression is not correct, there.being no such thing %0aas made salt. It is only collected from a state df suspension or dissolution. %0aPliny, however, includes under the name “sal” many substances, which %0ain reality are not salt. Ilis “ hainmoniacum,” for instance, if identical %0awith bydrochlorate of ammonia, can with justice be said to be made, being %0aformed artificially from other substances. %0a%0a85 “ Coacto humore vel siccato.” These two terms in reality imply the %0asame process, by the medium of evaporation ; the former perfect, the latter %0aimperfect. %0a%0a86 The evaporation not being sufficiently strong to dry up the deeper parts. %0a%0a87 There is in reality nothing wonderful in this, considering that most %0alakes are constantly fed with the streams of rivers, which carry mineral salts %0aalong with them, and that the work of evaporation is always going on. %0a%0a88 “ Glaebas.” %0a%0a89 Because it is necessarily purer than that found upon the sand. %0a%0a90 The description is not sufficiently clear to enable us to identify these %0alakes with certainty. Ajasson thinks that one of them may be the Lake %0a%0a%0aChap. 39.] %0a%0a%0aTHE VAItlOUS KINDS OE SALT. %0a%0a%0a501 %0a%0a%0aof Scythia, the other on that of Ariana, both of which throw %0aup vast quantities of salt. 91 So, too, at Citium, in Cyprus ; and, %0ain the vicinity of Memphis, they extract salt from the lake %0aand dry it in the sun. The surface-waters of some rivers, also, %0acondense 92 in the form of salt, the rest of the stream flowing %0abeneath, as though under a crust of ice ; such a3 the running %0awaters near the Caspian Gates 93 for instance, which are known %0aas the “Itivers of Salt.’’ The same is the case, too, in the vici¬ %0anity of the Mardi and of the people of Armenia. In Bactriana, %0aalso, the rivers Oehus 91 and Oxus carry down from the moun¬ %0atains on their banks, fragments of salt. There are also in %0aAfrica some lakes, the waters of which are turbid, that are %0aproductive of salt. Some hot springs, too, produce salt—those %0aat Pagasoe for example. Such, then, are the various kinds of %0asalt produced spontaneously by water. %0a%0aThere are certain mountains, also, formed of native salt; that %0aof Oromenus, in India, for example, where it is cut out like %0ablocks from a quarry, and is continually reproduced, bringing %0ain a larger revenue to the sovereigns of those countries than %0athat arising from their gold and pearls. In some instances %0ait is dug out of the earth, being formed there, evidently, by %0athe condensation of the moisture, as in Cappadocia for example, %0awhere it is cut in sheets, like those of mirror-stone. 95 The %0ablocks of it are very heavy, the name commonly given to them %0abeing “ mica.” 95 At Gerrhse, 97 a city of Arabia, the ramparts %0aand houses are constructed of blocks of salt, which are sol¬ %0adered together by being moistened with water. King Ptole- %0amaeus discovered salt also in the vicinity of Pelusium, when %0ahe encamped there ; a circumstance which induced other per¬ %0asons to seek and discover it in the scorched tracts that lie %0abetween Kgypt and Arabia, beneath the sand. In the same %0a%0aof Badakandir in the Khan at of Bokhara ; and the other the lake that lies %0abetween Ankhio and Akeba, in the west of the tenitoiy of Balkh, and near %0athe Usbek Tartars. 91 “ S;de exmstuant.” %0a%0a92 In consequence of the intense heat. . %0a%0a93 All these regions, Ajasson remarks, are covered with salt. An im¬ %0amense desert of s°alt extends to the north-east of Irak-Adjemi, and to the %0anorth of Kerman, between Tabaristan, western Khoracan, and Kholiistan. %0a%0an Identified by Ajasson with the Herat and the Djihoun. He thinks %0athat it is of some of the small affluents of this last that Pliny speaks. %0a%0a94 “ Lapis specularis.” %0a%0a96 \ “ crumb ” properly, in the Latin language, %0a%0a91 See B. vi. c. 32. %0a%0a%0a50: %0a%0a%0apliny’s natubal histoby. %0a%0a%0a[Book XXXI. %0a%0a%0amanner, too, it has been found in the thirsting deserts of %0aAfrica, as far as the oracle of Hamrnon, 98 a locality in which %0athe salt increases at night with the increase of the moon. %0a%0aThe districts of Cyrenaica are ennobled, too, by the production %0aof hammoniacum," a salt so called from the fact of its being %0afound beneath the sands 1 there. It is similar in colour to the %0aalum known as “ schiston,” 2 and consists of long pieces, by no %0ameans transparent, and of an unpleasant flavour, but highly %0auseful in medicine; that being held in the highest esteem, %0awhich is the clearest and divides into straight 3 flakes. There %0ais one remarkable fact mentioned in connexion with it: so long %0aas it lies underground in its bed 4 it is extremely light, but the %0amoment it is exposed to the light, it is hardly credible to what %0aan extent its weight is increased. The reason for this is evi¬ %0adent : 5 the humid vapours of the excavations bear the masses %0aupwards, as water does, and so aid the workmen. It is adulte¬ %0arated with the Sicilian salt which we have mentioned as being %0afound in Lake Cocanicus, as also with that of Cyprus, which %0ais marvellously like it. At Egelasta, 6 in Nearer Spain, there %0ais a salt, hewn from the bed in almost transparent blocks, and %0ato which for this long time past most medical men, it is said, %0ahave given the preference over all other salt. Every spot in %0a%0a38 More commonly known as Jupiter Hamrnon. %0a%0a99 See B. xii. c. 49, and B. xxiv. c. 28, for an account of gum resin am¬ %0amoniac, a produce of the same locality. The substance here spoken of is %0aconsidered by Beckmann to be nothing but common salt in an impure state. %0aSee his Hist. Inv. Yol. II. pp. 398-9, where this passage is discussed at %0aconsiderable length. Ajasson, on the other hand, considers it to be Hydro¬ %0achlorate of ammonia, the Sal ammoniac of commerce. According to some %0aaccounts, it was originally made in the vicinity of the Temple of Jupiter %0aHamrnon, by burning camels’ dung. %0a%0a1 Called afifioQ, in Greek. 2 See B. xxxv. c. 52. %0a%0a3 Sal ammoniac crystallizes in octahedrons. %0a%0a4 “ Intra specus suos.” On this passage, Beckmann says, “ From what %0ais said by Pliny it may with certainty be concluded that this salt was dug %0a%0aup from pits or mines in Africa.-Many kinds of rock-salt, taken from %0a%0athe mines of Wieliczka, experience the same change in the air ; so that %0ablocks which a labourer can easily carry in the mine, can scarcely be lifted %0aby him after being for some time exposed to the air. The cause here is %0aundoubtedly the same as that which makes many kinds of artificial salt to %0abecome moist and to acquire more weight.”—Yol. II. p. 399, Bohn’s Ed. %0a%0a5 According to modern notions, his reason is anything but evident. %0a%0a6 In Celtiberia. He alludes to the mountain of salt at Cardona, near %0aMontserrat in Catalonia. %0a%0a%0aChap. 40.] %0a%0a%0aMUIIIA. %0a%0a%0a503 %0a%0a%0awhich salt 7 is found is naturally barren, and produces nothing. %0aSuch are the particulars, in general, which have been ascer¬ %0atained with reference to native salt. %0a%0aOf artificial salt there are several kinds; the common salt, %0aand the most abundant, being made from sea-water drained %0ainto salt-pans, and accompanied Avith streams of fresh water; %0abut it is rain more particularly, and, above all things, the sun, %0athat aids in its formation ; indeed without this last it would %0anever dry. In the neighbourhood of Utica, in Africa, they build %0aup masses of salt, like hills in appearance; and when these have %0abeen hardened by the action of the sun and moon, no moisture %0awill ever melt them, and iron can hardly divide them. In %0aCrete, however, salt is made without the aid of fresh water, %0aand merely by introducing sea-water into the salt-pans. On %0athe shores of Egypt, salt is formed by the overflow of the sea %0aupon the land, already prepared for its reception, in my opinion, %0aby the emanations of the river Nilus. It is made here, also, %0afrom the water 8 of certain wells, discharged into salt-pans. At %0aBabylon, the result of the first condensation is a bituminous 9 %0aliquid, like oil, which is used for burning in lamps ; when this %0ais skimmed off, the salt is found beneath. In Cappadocia, %0aalso, both well and spring-water are introduced into the salt¬ %0apans. In Chaonia there is a spring, from the water of which, %0awhen boiled 10 and left to cool, there is an inert salt obtained, %0anot so white as ordinary salt. In the Gallic provinces and %0ain Germany, it is the practice to pour salt-water upon burning %0awood. 11 %0a%0aCHAP. 40.-MTTKIA. %0a%0aIn one part of Spain, they draw a brine for this purpose %0afrom deep-sunk pits, to which they give the name of “muria;” %0abeing of opinion, also, that it makes a considerable difference %0aupon what kind of wood it is poured. That of the quercus %0athey look upon as the best, as the ashes of it, unmixed, have %0a%0a7 Speaking generally, this is true; but soils which contain it in small %0aquantities are fruitful. %0a%0a8 A similar method is still employed, Ajasson says, at the salt-mines near %0a%0aInnspruck in the Tyrol. . ... %0a%0a9 Native bitumen ; always to be found in greater or less quantities, in %0asaliferous earths. %0a%0a10 The process of artificial evaporation. %0a%0a11 This would produce an impure alkaline salt.

All salt %0athat is thus prepared with burning wood is black. I find it %0astated by Theophrastus, that the Umbri 13 are in the habit of %0aboiling ashes of reeds and bulrushes in water, till there remains %0abut little moisture unconsumed. The brine, too, of salted %0aprovisions is sometimes boiled over again, and, as soon as all %0athe moisture has evaporated, the salt resumes its original form. %0aThat prepared from the pickle of the msena 14 has the finest %0aflavour. %0a%0aCHAF. 41. -THE VARIOUS PROPERTIES OP SALT: ONE HUNDRED %0a%0aAND TWENTY HISTORICAL REMARKS RELATIVE THERETO. %0a%0aOf the various kinds of sea-salt, the most esteemed is that of %0aSalamis, in Cyprus; and of the lake-salts, that of Tarentum, %0aand the salt known as Tattsean salt, which comes from Phrygia: %0athese last two are also good for the eyes. That of Cappadocia, %0awhich is imported in small cubes, 15 imparts a fine colour, it is %0asaid, to the skin; but, for effacing wrinkles, that which we %0ahave 16 already spoken of as the salt of Citium is the best: %0ahence it is that, in combination with gith, 17 it is used by fe¬ %0amales as a liniment for the abdomen after childbirth. The %0adrier the salt, the stronger it is in taste; but the most agree¬ %0aable of all, and the whitest known, is that of Tarentum. In %0aaddition to these particulars, we would remark also, that the %0awhiter salt is, the more friable it is. Rain-water deadens %0aevery kind of salt, but dew-water makes it more delicate in %0aflavour. North-easterly winds render the formation of salt %0amore abundant, but, while south winds prevail, it never in¬ %0acreases. It is only while north-easterly winds prevail, that %0aflower of salt 15 is formed. Neither the salt of Tragasa, nor %0a%0a12 “ The water, evaporating, would leave the salt behind, but mixed with %0acharcoal, ashes, earth, and alkaline salts; consequently it must have been %0amoist, or at any rate nauseous, if not refined by a new solution.”—Beck¬ %0amann’s Hist.

In Cappa¬ %0adocia there is a saffron-coloured fossil salt, transparent and %0aremarkably odoriferous. For medicinal purposes, the ancients %0aesteemed the salt of Tarentum in particular, and next to that %0aall the marine salts, those collected from sea-foam more espe¬ %0acially. For maladies of the eyes in cattle and beasts of burden, %0athe salt of Tragasa and that of Baetica are employed. For %0amade dishes 22 and ordinary food, the more easily a salt liquefies %0aand the moister it is, the more highly it is esteemed; there %0abeing less bitterness in salt of this description, that of Attica %0aand of Euboea, for example. For keeping meat, a pungent, %0adry, salt, like that of Megara, is best. A conserve of salt is also %0amade, with the addition of various odoriferous substances, %0awhich answers all the purpose of a choice sauce, 23 sharpening %0athe appetite, and imparting a relish to all kinds of food : in¬ %0adeed, among the innumerable condiments which we use, the %0aflavour of salt is always distinctly perceptible; and when %0awe take garum 21 with our food, it is its salt flavour that is %0aconsidered so exquisite. And not only this, but sheep even, %0acattle, and beasts of burden, are induced to graze all the bet¬ %0ater 25 by giving them salt; it having the effect, also, of con¬ %0asiderably augmenting the milk, and imparting a superior flavour %0ato the cheese. %0a%0aWe may conclude, then, by Hercules ! that the higher en¬ %0ajoyments of life could not exist without the use of salt: indeed, %0aso highly necessary is this substance to mankind, that the %0apleasures of the mind, even, can be expressed by no better %0aterm than the word “ salt,” 26 such being the name given to %0a%0a19 See B. iv. c. 17. %0a%0a20 St. Augustin mentions this marvellous kind of salt.

Even in the %0avery honours, too, that are bestoAved upon successful warfare, %0asalt plays its part, and from it, our Avord “ salarium” 27 is derived. %0aThat salt was held in high esteem by the ancients, is e\ r ident %0afrom the Salarian 28 Way, so named from the fact that, by %0aagreement, the Sab-ini carried all their salt by that road. King %0aAncus Martius gave six hundred modii of salt as a largess 29 %0ato the people, and Avas the first to establish salt-works. Yarro %0aalso informs us, that the ancients used salt by way of a relish¬ %0aing sauce; and we know, from an old proverb, 30 that it was %0athe practice with them to eat salt with their bread. But it is %0ain our sacred rites more particularly, that its high importance %0ais to be recognized, no offering ever being made unaccompanied %0aby the salted cake. 31 %0a%0aCHAP. 42.—FLOWER OF SALT : TAVENTY REMEDIES. SALSUGO : %0a%0aTAVO REMEDIES. %0a%0aThat which mainly distinguishes the produce of salt-works, %0ain respect of its purity, is a sort of efflorescence, 32 which forms %0athe lightest and whitest part of salt. The name “flower of %0asalt ” 33 is given, also, to a substance of an entirely different %0acharacter, more humid by nature, and of a red or saffron co¬ %0alour ; a kind of “rust of salt,” as it were, with an unpleasant %0asmell like that of garum, and differing therein not only from %0afroth of salt, 31 but from salt itself. This substance is found %0a%0a27 Literally, “ salt money”—“ argentum ” being understood. The term %0awas originally applied to the pay of the generals and military tribunes. %0aHence our word “ salary.” %0a%0a28 Beginning at the Colline Gate. 29 “ In congiario.” %0a%0a30 Most probably “ He cannot earn salt to his bread,” or something %0asimilar, like our saying, “ He cannot earn salt to his porridge.” The two %0aGreek proverbs given by Dalechamps do not appear to the purpose. %0a%0a31 “ Mola salsa.” 32 “Favillam.” %0a%0a33 “ Schroder thinks that in what Pliny says of Flos Salis, he can find %0athe martial sal ammoniac flowers of our chemists, [the double chloride of %0aammonium and iron], or the so-called flares sales ammoniaci martiales — %0aIt is certain that what Dioscorides and Pliny call flos salis, has never yet %0abeen defined. The most ingenious conjecture was that of Cordus, who %0athought that it might be Sperma ceti; but though I should prefer this %0aopinion to that of Schroder, I must confess that, on the grounds adduced %0aby Matthioli and Conrad Gesner, it has too much against it to be admitted %0aas truth.”—Beckmann, Hist.

The best kind is that %0awhich yields a certain fatty 35 substance, like oil—for salt even, %0aa thing that is quite marvellous to think of, is not without a %0adegree of unctuousness. %0a%0aThis substance is sophisticated, and coloured with red earth, %0aor, in most instances, with powdered potsherds; an adultera¬ %0ation to be detected by the agency of water, which washes off %0athe fictitious colour, the natural colour being only removeable %0aby the agency of oil. Indeed, it is for its colour that per¬ %0afumers more particularly make such extensive use of this drug. %0a"When seen in the vessels, the surface of it is white, but that %0awhich lies in the middle is moister, as already stated. It is %0aof an acrid nature, calorific, and bad for the stomach. It acts %0aalso as a sudorific, and, taken with wine and water, has a pur¬ %0agative effect upon the bowels. It is very useful, also, as an %0aingredient in acopa 36 and in detersive 37 compositions, aud is re¬ %0amarkably efficacious for the removal of hairs from the eye-lids. %0aIt is the practice to shake up the sediment, in order to re¬ %0anovate the saffron colour of the drug. %0a%0aIn addition to these substances, there is another, known in %0athe salt-works by the name of “salsugo,” or “salsilago it is %0aquite liquid, salter in taste than sea-water, but inferior to it in %0aits properties. %0a%0aCHAP. 43.- GARTTM : FIFTEEN REMEDIES. %0a%0aAnother liquid, too, of a very exquisite nature, is that %0aknown as “ gururn :” 38 it is prepared from the intestines of fish %0aand various parts which would otherwise be thrown away, %0amacerated in salt; so that it is, in fact, the result of their pu¬ %0atrefaction. Garum was formerly prepared from a fish, called %0a“garos” 39 by the Greeks ; who assert, also, that a fumigation %0amade with its head has the effect of bringing away the after¬ %0abirth. %0a%0a(8.)

Indeed, there is no liquid hardly, %0awith the exception of the unguents, that has sold at higher %0aprices of late; so much so, that the nations which produce it %0ahave become quite ennobled thereby. There are fisheries, %0atoo, of the scomber on the coasts of Mauretania, and at Carteia %0ain Baetica, near the Straits 43 which lie at the entrance to the %0aOcean ; this being the only use that is made of the fish. For %0athe production of garum, Clazomense is also famed, Pompeii, %0atoo, and Leptis ; while for their muria, Antipolis, 41 Thurii, and %0aof late, Dalmatia, 45 enjoy a high reputation. %0a%0aCHAP. 44.- ALEX : EIGHT REMEDIES. %0a%0aAlex, which is the refuse of garum, properly consists of the %0adregs of it, when imperfectly strained : but of late they have %0abegun to prepare it separately, from a small fish that is other¬ %0awise good for nothing, the apua 46 of the Latins, or aphua of %0athe Greeks, so called from the fact of its being engendered %0afrom rain. 47 The people of Forum Julii 48 make their garum %0afrom a fish to which they give the name of “lupus.” 49 In %0aprocess of time, alex has become quite an object of luxury, and %0athe various kinds that are now made are infinite in number. %0aThe same, too, -with garum, which is now prepared in imitation %0aof the colour of old honied wine, and so pleasantly flavoured %0aas to admit of being taken as a drink.

In the same -way, too, alex has %0acome to be manufactured from oysters, sea-urchins, sea-nettles, %0acammari, 52 and the liver of the surmullet; and a thousand %0adifferent methods have been devised of late for ensuring the %0aputrefaction of salt in such a way as to secure the flavours %0amost relished by the palate. %0a%0aThus much, by the way, with reference to the tastes of the %0apresent day; though at the same time, it must be remembered, %0athese substances are by no means without their uses in medi¬ %0acine. Alex, for instance, is curative of scab in sheep, incisions %0abeing made in the skin, and the liquor poured therein. It is %0auseful, also, for the cure of wounds inflicted by dogs or by %0athe sea-dragon, the application being made with lint. Recent %0aburns, too, are healed by the agency of garum, due care being %0ataken to apply it without mentioning it by name. It is useful, %0atoo, for bites inflicted by dogs, and for that of the crocodile in %0aparticular ; as also for the treatment of serpiginous or sordid %0aulcers. For ulcerations, and painful affections of the mouth %0aand ears, it is a marvellously useful remedy. %0a%0aMuria, also, as well as the salsugo which we have mentioned, 53 %0ahas certain astringent, mordent, and discussive properties, and is %0ahighly useful for the cure of dysentery, even when ulceration %0ahas attacked the intestines. Injections are also made of it %0afor sciatica, and for coeliac fluxes of an inveterate nature. In %0aspots which lie at a distance in the interior, it is used as a fo¬ %0amentation, by way of substitute for sea-water. %0a%0aCHAP. 45. (9.)— -THE NATURE OF SALT. %0a%0aSalt, regarded by itself, is naturally igneous, and yet it %0amanifests an antipathy to fire, and flies 51 from it. It consumes %0aeverything, and yet upon living bodies it has an astringent, %0adesiccative, and binding effect, while the dead it preserves %0afrom putrefaction, 55 and makes them last for ages even. In %0arespect, however, of its medicinal properties, it is of a mordent, %0aburning, detergent, attenuating, and resolvent nature; it is, how¬ %0aever, injurious to the stomach, except that it acts as a stimulant %0awithout scales being forbidden to the Jews by the Levitical Law. See Lev. %0ac. xi. ver. 10. It is, most probably, Pliny’s own mistake. %0a%0a53 See B. xxvii. c. 2.

It is used also among the remedies for the eyes, %0aand for the removal of fleshy excrescences upon those organs, %0aas also of hangnails 6 * upon the fingers or toes. For webs that %0aform upon the eyes it is peculiarly useful, and hence it is that %0ait is so commonly employed as an ingredient in eye-salves, as %0awell as plasters. For all these last-mentioned purposes, the %0asalt of Tatta or of Caunus is more particularly in request. %0a%0aIn cases where there is ecchymosis of the eyes, or a bruise %0afrom the effects of a blow, salt is applied, with an equal quan¬ %0atity of myrrh and honey, or with hyssop in warm water, the %0aeyes being also fomented with salsugo. For this last-mentioned %0apurpose, the Spanish salt is preferred; and when wanted for %0athe treatment of cataract, it is ground upon small whet¬ %0astones, with milk. For bruises it is particularly useful, %0awrapped in a linen pledget and renewed from time to time, %0abeing first dipped in boiling water. For the cure of running %0aulcers of the mouth, it is applied with lint; gum-boils are also %0arubbed with it; and, broken to pieces and powdered fine, it %0aremoves granulations on the tongue. The teeth, it is said, %0awill never become carious or corroded, if a person every morn¬ %0aing puts some salt beneath his tongue, fasting, and leaves it %0athere till it has melted. Salt effects the cure also of leprosy, %0aboils, lichens, and itch-scabs; for all which purposes it is ap¬ %0aplied with raisins—the stones being first removed—beef-suet, %0aoriganum, and leaven, or else bread. In such cases it is the %0asalt from Theba'is that is mostly used; the same salt being %0aconsidered preferable for the treatment of prurigo, and being %0ahighly esteemed for affections of the uvula and tonsillary glands, %0ain combination with honey. %0a%0a65 He uses the word “ pterygia ” here, as applied to the whole of the %0abody—“ totius corporis ”—in its two distinct senses, a hangnail or ex¬ %0acrescence on the fingers, and a web or film on the eyes. %0a%0a%0aChap. 45.] %0a%0a%0aTHE NATURE OF SALT. %0a%0a%0a511 %0a%0a%0aEvery kind of salt is useful for the cure of quiuzy ; but, in %0aaddition to this, it is necessary to make external applications %0asimultaneously with oil, vinegar, and tar. Mixed with %0awine, it is a gentle aperient to the bowels, and, taken in a %0asimilar manner, it acts as an expellent of all kinds of intestinal %0aworms. Placed beneath the tongue, it enables convalescents %0ato support the heat 67 of the bath. Burnt more than once upon %0aa plate at a white heat, and then enclosed in a bag, it alleviates %0apains in the sinews, about the shoulders and kidneys more %0aparticularly. Taken internally, and similarly burnt at a white %0aheat and applied in bags, it is curative of colic, griping pains %0ain the bowels, and sciatica. Beaten up in wine and honey, %0awith meal, it is a remedy for gout; a malady for the especial %0abehoof of which the observation should be borne in mind, %0athat there is nothing better for all parts of the body than sun %0aand salt : 58 hence 59 it is that we see the bodies of fishermen as %0ahard as horn—gout, however, is the principal disease for the %0abenefit of which this maxim should be remembered. %0a%0aSalt is useful for the removal of corns upon the feet, and of %0achilblains : for the cure of burns also, it is applied with oil, or %0aelse chewed. It acts as a check also upon blisters, and, in cases %0aof erysipelas and serpiginous ulcers, it is applied topically with %0avinegar or with hyssop. Por the cure of carcinoma it is %0aemployed in combination with Taminian 60 grapes; and for %0aphagedaenic ulcers it is used parched with barley-meal, a %0alinen pledget steeped in wine being laid upon it. In cases of %0ajaundice, it is employed as a friction before the fire, with oil %0aaud vinegar, till the patient is made to perspire, for the purpose %0aof preventing the itching sensations attendant upon that dis¬ %0aease. When persons are exhausted with fatigue, it is usual to %0arub them with salt and oil. Many have treated dropsy with %0asalt, have used external applications of salt and oil for the %0aburning heats of fever, and have cured chronic coughs by laying %0asalt upon the patient’s tongue. Salt has been used, also, as %0aan injection for sciatica, and has been applied to ulcers of a %0afungous or putrid nature. %0a%0aTo bites inflicted by the crocodile, salt is applied, the sores %0a%0a67 In c. 23, he has said much the same of cold water. %0a%0a58 “ Sale et sole.” %0a%0a59 This passage would come more naturally after the succeeding one. %0a%0a60 See fi. xxiii. c. 13. %0a%0a%0a512 %0a%0a%0apliny’s natural history. %0a%0a%0a[Hook XXXI. %0a%0a%0aLeing tightly bandaged with linen cloths, first dipped 61 in %0avinegar. It is taken internally, with hydromel, to neutralize %0athe effects of opium, and is applied topically, with meal and %0ahoney, to sprains and fleshy excrescences. In cases of tooth¬ %0aache, it is used as a collutory with vinegar, and is very useful, %0aapplied externally, with resin. For all these purposes, however, %0afroth of salt 62 is found to be more agreeable and still more %0aefficacious. Still, however, every kind of salt is good as an %0aingredient in acopa, 63 when warming properties are required: %0athe same, too, in the case of detersive applications, when re¬ %0aquired for plumping out and giving a smooth surface to the %0askin. Employed topically, salt is curative of itch-scab in sheep %0aand cattle, for which disease it is given them to lick. It is %0ainjected, also, with the spittle, into the eyes of beasts of burden. %0aThus much with reference to salt. %0a%0aCHAP. 46. (10.)- THE VARIOUS KINDS OF NITRUM, THE METHODS %0a%0aOF PREPARING IT, AND THE REMEDIES DERIVED FROM IT; TWO %0a%0aHUNDRED AND TWENTY-ONE OBSERVATIONS THEREON. %0a%0aAnd here we must no longer defer giving an account of %0anitrum ; 64 which in its properties does not greatly differ from %0asalt, and deserves all the more to be attentively considered, %0afrom the evident fact that the medical men who have written %0aupon it were ignorant of its nature; of all which authors %0aTheophrastus is the one that has given the greatest attention to %0athe point. It is found in small quantities in Media, in certain %0avalleys there that are white with heat and Thought; the name %0agiven to it being “ halmyrax.” 65 In Thracia, too, near Philippi, %0a%0a61 “ Ita ut batuerent.ur ante.” From the corresponding passage in %0aDioscorides, where the expression Bmrr6fi.rvoi tu; 6 £og is used, it would %0aappear that the proper word here is “ baptizarenturor possibly, a lost %0aGraeco-Latin word, “ bapterentur.” Littrd suggests “ hebetarentur,” “the %0apart being first numbed ” by the aid of a bandage. %0a%0a63 “ Spuma salis.” Collected from the foam on the sea-shore. %0a%0a63 See Note 36, above, p. 507. . %0a%0a64 Beckmann, who devotes several pages to a consideration of the “ ni- %0a%0atiuxm ” of the ancients, considers it not to be our “ nitre.” or “ saltpetre,” %0abut a general name for impure alkaline salts. See his Hist. Inv. Vol. II. %0app. 490—503, Bohn's Ed. Ajasson, without hesitation, pronounces it to %0abe nitrate of potash, neither more or less than our saltpetre, and quotes a %0astatement from Andreossy, that it is still to be found in great quantities %0aat Mount Ptou-Ampihosem, near the city of Pihosem, called Nitria by %0aSt. Jerome. * “Salt bursting from the earth.” %0a%0a%0aChap. 46.] %0a%0a%0aVARIOUS KINDS OF NITRUM. %0a%0a%0a513 %0a%0a%0ait is found, but in smaller quantities, and deteriorated with %0aearthy substances, being known there as “ agrion.” 66 As to %0athat prepared from the burnt wood of the quercus, 67 it never %0awas made to any very great extent, and the manufacture of it %0ahas been long since totally abandoned. Nitrous 68 waters are also %0afound in numerous places, but not sufficiently impregnated to %0aadmit of condensation. 69 %0a%0aThe best and most abundant supply is found at Litae, in %0aMacedonia, where it is known as “ Chalastricum :” 70 it is white %0aand pure, and closely resembles salt. In the middle of a cer¬ %0atain nitrous lake there, a spring of fresh water issues forth. In %0athis lake the nitrum 71 forms for nine days, about the rising of %0athe Dog-star, and then ceases for the same period, after which %0ait again floats upon the surface, and then again ceases: facts %0awhich abundantly prove that it is the peculiar nature of the soil %0awhich generates the nitrum, it being very evident that, when %0athe formation is there interrupted, neither the heat of the sun %0anor the fall of rain is productive of the slightest effect. It %0ais also a truly marvellous fact, that though the spring of fresh %0awater is always uninterruptedly flowing, the waters of the lake %0anever increase or overflow. If it happens to rain on the days %0aduring which the nitrum is forming, the result is, that it is %0arendered additionally salt thereby: the prevalence of north¬ %0aeast winds, too, still more deteriorates its quality, as they have %0aa tendency to stir up the mud at the bottom. Such is the %0aformation of native nitrum. %0a%0aIn Egypt, again, it is made artificially, and in much greater %0aabundance, but of inferior quality, being tawny and full of %0a%0a« “ Wild.” . , %0a%0a67 See c. 40 of this Book. He is evidently speaking of a vegetable al¬ %0akali here. See Beckmann, Vol. II. pp. 492-3, Bohn’s Ed. %0a%0a«s Beckmann thinks that these kinds of water were in reality only im¬ %0apure and not potable, from their nauseous taste, and that hence they were %0aconsidered as nitrous.

V. %0a%0a%0aL L ' %0a%0a%0a514 flint’s NATURAL HISTORY. [Book XXXI. %0a%0astones. It is prepared in pretty nearly the same manner 73 as %0asalt, except that in the salt-pans it is sea-water that is intro¬ %0aduced, whereas in the nitre-beds it is the water of the river %0aHilus; a water which, upon the subsidence of the river, is %0aimpregnated with nitrum for forty days together, and not, as in %0aMacedonia, at intermittent periods only. On occasions when %0athere has been a fall of rain, a smaller proportion of river- %0awater is employed. As soon, too, as any quantity of nitrum %0ahas formed, it is immediately removed, in order that it may not %0amelt in the beds. This substance, also, contains a certain %0aproportion of oil, 73 which is very useful for the cure of scab in %0aanimals. Piled up in large heaps, it keeps for a very con¬ %0asiderable time. It is a marvellous fact, that, in Lake Ascanius 74 %0aand in certain springs in the vicinity of Chalcis, the water is %0afresh and potable on the surface, and nitrous below. The %0alightest part of nitrum is always considered the best, and hence %0ait is that the froth of it is so much preferred. Still, however, %0awhen in an impure state, it is very useful for some purposes, %0acolouring purple 75 cloth, for instance, and, indeed, all kinds of %0adyeing. It is employed, also, very extensively in the manu¬ %0afacture of glass, as we shall more fully mention on the appro¬ %0apriate occasion. 76 %0a%0aThe only nitre-works in Egypt were formerly those in the %0avicinity of Haucratis and Memphis; those near Memphis being %0ainferior to the others, the piles of nitrum there prepared %0abeing as hard as stone, and many of the heaps having %0abecome changed into rocks. When in this state, vessels are %0amade of it, and very frequently they melt it with sulphur 77 on %0a%0a72 Ajasson remarks, that from this we may conclude that the fabrication %0aof nitrate of potash, or saltpetre, was in its infancy. It is by no means %0aimprobable that the artificial nitrum, here mentioned by Pliny, really was %0aartificial saltpetre, more or less impure ; the native nitrum, on the other %0ahand, being, as Beckmann suggests, a general term for impure alkaline %0amineral salts, in common with native saltpetre. Pliny’s account, however, %0ais confused in the highest degree, and in some passages far from intel¬ %0aligible. %0a%0a73 Of a bituminous nature, probably. See c. 42 of this Book. %0a%0a74 See B. v. c. 40. An alkaline water, Beckmann thinks. See Yol. II. %0app. 96-7. Bohn’s Ed. %0a%0a73 He may possibly mean bleaching the material before dyeing. %0a%0a76 See B. xxxvi. c. 65. This certainly goes far towards proving that %0aunder the name “ nitrum,” alkaline salts were included. %0a%0a77 “ Faciunt ex his vasa, necnon frequenter liquatum cum sulphure, co- %0a%0a%0aChap. 46.] %0a%0a%0aVARIOUS KINDS OR NITBTJM. %0a%0a%0a515 %0a%0a%0aa charcoal fire.’ 8 When substances 79 are wanted to keep, they %0aemploy this last kind of nitrum. In Egypt there are also nitre- %0abeds, the produce of which is red, owing to the colour of the %0aearth in the same locality. Froth of nitrum, 80 a substance %0aheld in very high esteem, could only be made, according to the %0aancients, when dews had fallen ; the pits being at the moment %0asaturated with nitrum, but not having arrived at the point of %0ayielding it. On the other hand, again, when the pits were in %0afull activity, no froth would form, it was said, even though %0adews should fall. Others, again, have attributed the formation %0aof this last substance to the fermentation of the heaps of %0anitrum. In a succeeding age, the medical men, speaking of it %0aunder the name of “ aphronitrum,” 81 have stated that it was %0acollected in Asia, where it was to be found oozing from the %0asoft sides of certain mines—the name given to which was %0a“ colyces” 82 —and that it was then dried in the sun. The very %0abest is thought to be that which comes from Lydia; the test of %0aits genuineness being its extreme lightness, its friability, and %0aits colour, which should be almost a full purple. This last is %0aimported in tablets, while that of Egypt comes enclosed in %0a%0aquentes in carbonibus.” This passage Beckmann pronounces to be one of %0athe darkest parts in the history of nitrum. See Vol. II. p. 502. He is of %0aopinion that not improbably the result here obtained would be, liver of %0asulphur, which when it cools is hard, but soon becomes moist when ex¬ %0aposed to the air. Dalechamps, it would appear, explains the whole of this %0apassage as applicable to glazing; but in such case, as Beckmann observes, %0athe nitrum could serve only as a flux. Michaelis suggests that the vessels %0ahere mentioned, were cut, not for real use, but merely for ornament, in the %0asame manner as they are still made, occasionally, from rock-salt. %0a%0a18 The mention of nitrum, sulphur, and charcoal, probably the three %0aingredients of gunpowder, in such close proximity, is somewhat curious. %0a%0a79 “ Quae ” seems a preferable reading to “ quos.” %0a%0a80 “ Spuma nitri.” An accidental property, Beckmann says, of the %0asame salt that has been previously called “ Chalastrieum,” “ Ilalmyrax,” %0a“Aphronitrum,” and “ Agrion.” In his opinion, “ the ancients were ac¬ %0aquainted with no other than native nitrum, which they called artificial , %0aonly when it required a little more trouble and art to obtain it.”— Hist. %0aInv. Vol. II. p. 502. Bohn's Ed. %0a%0a81 “ Froth of nitre.” Ajasson identifies this with hydro-carbonate of %0asoda. %0a%0a82 Supposed by Hardouin to be derived from the Greek koXlkciq , “round %0acakes;” owing to the peculiar form of the pieces of rock by which the %0aaphronitrum was produced. The reading, however, is very doubtful. %0aSillig, from Photius, suggests that it should be “ scolecas.” %0a%0a%0a516 %0a%0a%0apunt’s natural histort. %0a%0a%0a[Book XXXI. %0a%0a%0avessels pitched within, to prevent its melting, 83 the vessels %0abeing previously prepared by being thoroughly dried in the %0asun. 84 %0a%0aTo be good, nitrum should be very fine, and extremely %0aspongy and porous. In Egypt, it is sophisticated with lime, %0aan adulteration easily detected 85 by tasting it; for when pure, %0ait liquefies immediately, while that which has been adulte¬ %0arated, remains undissolved sufficiently long to leave a pungent %0ataste 86 in the mouth. It is burnt in a close earthen vessel, as %0aotherwise it would decrepitate : 87 except in this last case, how¬ %0aever, the action of fire does not cause it to decrepitate. This %0asubstance neither produces-nor nourishes anything; while, in %0athe salt-pans, on the other hand, we see plants growing, and %0athe sea, we know, produces immense numbers of animated %0abeings, though, as to plants, sea-weed only. It is evident, too, %0athat the acridity 88 of nitrum must be much greater than that %0aof salt, not only from the fact last mentioned, but from the %0acircumstance also, that at the nitre-beds the shoes wear out %0awith the greatest rapidity; localities which are otherwise very %0ahealthy, and remarkably beneficial for the eye-sight. At the %0anitre-works ophthalmia is a thing unknown : persons, too, %0athat come there with ulcers upon them experience a rapid %0acure; though ulcerations formed upon the spot are but slow %0ain healing. Used as a friction with oil, nitrum is a sudorific, %0aand acts emolliently upon the body. That of Chalastra is %0aused as a substitute for salt, in making bread, 89 and the Egyp- %0a%0a83 One proof, Beckmann thinks, that Soda is meant. See Yol. II. p. %0a%0a491. e %0a%0a84 “ Whether Pliny means that the vessels were not burnt, but only %0abaked in the sun, or that before they were filled, they were completely %0adried in the sun, has been determined by no commentator. To me the %0alatter is probable.”—Beckmann, Hist. Inv. Vol. II. p. 491. %0a%0a85 Beckmann thinks that this mode of adulteration, with lime, is an %0a%0aadditional proof that the “ nitrum ” of our author was only soda. See %0aYol. II. p. 492. J %0a%0a86 That, namely, of the lime. Quick-lime, certainly, would have a pun¬ %0agent taste, in comparison with that of soda, but not in comparison with %0athat of saltpetre. %0a%0a87 Another proof, Beckmann thinks, that it was native soda, impregnated %0awith common salt. Vol. II. p. 492. %0a%0a88 This would hardly apply to soda. %0a%0a89 Probably to promote its rising, as Beckmann observes, Vol. II. p. %0a496; a circumstance which goes a great way towards proving that “ Soda” %0a%0a%0aChap. 4G.] %0a%0a%0aVAEIOTTS KINDS OF NITEUil. %0a%0a%0a517 %0a%0a%0atian nitrum is eaten 90 with radishes, 91 it having the effect of %0amaking them more tender; though as to other edibles it turns %0athem white and spoils them. To vegetables it imparts an ad¬ %0aditional greenness. 92 %0a%0aViewed medicinally, nitrum is calorific, attenuant, mordent, %0aastringent, desiccative, and ulcerating: it is good, too, in all %0acases where certain humours require to be drawn out or dis¬ %0apersed, or where gentle mordents or attenuants are required, %0aas in the case of pustules and pimples, for example. Some %0apersons ignite it for this purpose, and, after quenching it in %0aastringent wine, bruise and use it, without oil, at the bath. %0aApplied with dried iris powdered, and green olive oil, it checks %0aimmoderate perspiration. Applied topically with a fig, or boiled %0adown to one half in raisin wine, it removes marks upon the %0aeyes and granulations of the eyelids. It is used, also, for the %0aremoval of argema, boiled in a pomegranate rind with raisin %0awine. Used as an ointment, in combination with honey, it %0aimproves the eye-sight. It is very useful, also, for tooth-ache, %0ataken as a collutory with wine and pepper, or boiled with a %0aleek. Burnt, and employed as a dentifrice, it restores teeth 93 %0ato their original colour that have turned black ; and an appli¬ %0acation of it, with Samian earth and oil, kills nits and other %0avermin of the head. Dissolved in wine, it is used as an in¬ %0ajection for suppurations of the ears, and, applied with vinegar, %0ait consumes filth that has accumulated there. Introduced %0adry into the ears, it disperses singings and tinglings in those %0aorgans. %0a%0aApplied topically, in the sun, with an equal quantity of %0aCimolian 94 chalk dissolved in vinegar, it removes white mor- %0aphew ; and a mixture of it with resin, or with white raisins— %0athe stones being beaten up as well—is an excellent cure for %0a%0awas included, at least, under the name of “ nitrum.’’ Carbonate of soda is %0aextensively used for this purpose at the present day. %0a%0a90 And to correct the acridity of the radishes, possibly. A somewhat %0aanalogous fact is mentioned by Drury, in his “Journal in Madagascar.’’ %0aHe says that the sourest tamarinds, “ mixed with wood ashes, become %0asweet and eatable.” See p. 316.—"We are not unaware that many look %0aupon this work and its statements as a work of fiction. %0a%0a91 See B. xix. c. 26. %0a%0a92 Carbonate of soda is added to pickles and boiling vegetables for this %0apurpose. %0a%0a93 Vegetable ashes, and tobacco ashes in particular, have the same effect. %0a%0a91 See B. xxxv. c. 57. %0a%0aL L 3 %0a%0a%0a518 %0a%0a%0aflint’s NATUBAL HISTOEY. %0a%0a%0a[Book XXXI. %0a%0a%0aboils. It is useful, also, for inflammations of the testes ; and, %0ain combination with axle-grease, for pituitous eruptions on all %0aparts of the body. For the cure of bites inflicted by dogs, it %0ais used with resin, the application being made at first with vine¬ %0agar. With lime and vinegar, it is used as a liniment for stings %0ainflicted by serpents, as, also, for ulcerations, whether phage- %0adaenic, putrid, or serpiginous; in cases, too, of dropsy, it is %0aemployed both internally and externally, beaten up with figs. %0aTaken internally as a decoction, in doses of one drachma, with %0arue, dill, or cummin, it effectually removes griping pains in %0athe bowels. An external application of it, with oil and vine¬ %0agar, is highly refreshing to persons exhausted with fatigue; %0aand it is equally beneficial for shudderings and cold shiverings, %0athe feet and hands of the patient being well rubbed with it, %0amixed with oil. It allays the itching sensations attendant %0aupon jaundice, more particularly when it is administered to %0athe patient while perspiring, with vinegar. Taken internally %0ain oxycrate, it is an antidote to the poison of fungi; and, taken %0awith water, it acts beneficially, as an emetic, in cases where the %0abuprestis has been swallowed. %0a%0aTo persons who have taken bull’s blood, 95 nitrum is admi¬ %0anistered, in combination with laser. 96 Mixed with honey and %0acow’s milk, it is curative of ulcers upon the face. For the cure %0aof burns, it is applied pounded, being first parched till it turns %0ablack. For pains in the bowels and kidneys, and for rigidities %0aof the limbs and pains in the sinews, it is used in the form of %0aan injection. For the cure of paralysis of the tongue, it is %0aapplied to that organ with bread, and to asthmatic patients it is %0aadministered in a ptisan. Flower of nitrum, used in combi¬ %0anation with equal proportions of galbanum and turpentine %0arespectively, is curative of chronic coughs ; the mixture being %0ataken in pieces the size of a bean.

(11.) -SPONGES, AND THE REMEDIES DERIVED FROM %0a%0aTHEM : NINETY-TWO OBSERVATIONS THEREON. %0a%0a%0aWe have already, 1 when speaking of the marine productions, %0adescribed the various kinds of sponge. Some authorities make %0athe following distinctions : they regard as males 2 those sponges %0awhich are pierced with more diminutive holes, are more com¬ %0apact in form and more ready to imbibe, and are stained, to %0asatisfy luxurious tastes, in various colours, sometimes purple %0aeven : those, on the other hand, which have holes, larger and %0arunning into one another, they consider to be females. Among %0athe male sponges, too, there is one kind, harder than the others, %0athe name given to which is “tragi,” 3 and the holes of which %0aare extremely small and numerous. Sponges are made white %0aartificially; the softest being chosen for the purpose, and after %0athey have been steeped the whole summer through with the %0afoam of the sea. They are then exposed to the action of the %0amoon and hoar-frosts, being turned upside down, or, in other %0awords, with that part upwards by which they formerly ad¬ %0ahered to the rocks, the object being that they may become %0a%0awhite throughout. , , , , %0a%0aThat sponges are animated beings, we have already stated; %0a%0a%0a99 Beckmann considers that this statement throws some light on the %0aobscure passage, commented on in Note 77, p. 514 See Hist Inv. ^ ol. %0aII. p. 503. Bohn’s Ed. In B. is. c. 69. %0a%0a2 No such distinction, of course, really exists; sponge being in reality %0aa fibrous tissue formed by minute animals. %0a%0aJ “ Goats,” literally. %0a%0a%0a520 %0a%0a%0apliny’s natural history. %0a%0a%0a[Book XXXI. %0a%0a%0aand not only this, but they have a coat of blood 1 even, adhering %0ato them. Some say that they regulate their movements by %0athe sense of hearing, and that at the slightest noise they con¬ %0atract themselves, and emit an abundant moisture : when such %0ais the case, it is said, it is impossible to tear them away from %0athe rocks, and consequently they must be cut, an operation %0aduring which they emit a sanious secretion. Those sponges, %0atoo, are preferred to all others, which are grown on spots with %0aa north-east aspect, the physicians assuring us that these re¬ %0atain the breath of life the longest of all; a circumstance which %0arenders them additionally useful to the human body, from the %0aunion which is thereby effected of their vital principle with %0aour own. 5 It is for this reason, too, that they are preferred as %0afresh as possible, and in a moist state rather than dry. They %0aare not so useful, however, if applied with hot water, 8 and %0astill less so if they are oiled, or applied to the body when just %0aanointed. The compact sponges, it is thought, have less adhe¬ %0asive power than the others. %0a%0aThe softest kind of sponge are those employed for tents. 7 %0aApplied with honied wine, sponges reduce swellings of the eyes, %0aand are extremely useful for the removal of rheum from those %0aorgans, the very finest and softest being of necessity selected %0afor the purpose. Sponges are applied, also, with oxycrate, to %0adefluxions of the eyes, and, with warm vinegar, for head-ache. %0aIn addition to these properties, fresh sponges are resolvent, %0aemollient, and soothing; but when old, they lose their %0ahealing properties for wounds. They are employed, also, in %0amedicine,for cleansing sores, and for either fomenting or cover¬ %0aing the parts fomented, till some other application is made. %0aApplied topically, they have a healing effect upon running %0aulcers, and upon sores on the bodies of aged persons. Fractures, %0atoo, and wounds are most effectually fomented with sponge; %0aand when surgical operations are performed, it instantly ab¬ %0asorbs the blood, so as to allow the incision to be seen. Sponges %0aare applied, also, as a bandage, to inflamed wounds, sometimes %0a%0a4 See B. ix. c. 69. He probably alludes to the semifluid thin coat of %0aanimal jelly which covers the sponge in its recent state, and is susceptible %0aof a slight contraction on being touched. %0a%0a5 A fanciful notion, certainly. %0a%0a6 Hot water renders them greasy, so to say; an inconvenience which %0amay be remedied by steeping them in an alkaline solution,^ or in urine. %0a%0a7 “ Penicilli.” %0a%0a%0aChap. 47.] %0a%0a%0a8P0NGES. %0a%0a%0a521 %0a%0a%0adry, and, in some cases, moistened with vinegar, wine, or cold %0awater. Soaked in rain-water, and applied to the incision, %0athey prevent cuts recently inflicted from swelling. They are %0aused as an application for such parts of the body, though appa¬ %0arently uninjured, as are threatened with occult humours which %0arequire to be dispersed; as also for reducing the tumours %0aknown to us as “apostemes,” the parts being first fomented with %0aa decoction of honey. Sponges are employed, also, for affections %0aof the joints, steeped in vinegar and salt, or in oxycrate : in %0acases, however, where the attack is attended with fever, water %0aalone is used with the sponge. Soaked in salt and water, %0asponges are applied to callosities; and, with vinegar, they are %0aused for stings inflicted by scorpions. %0a%0aIn the treatment of wounds, sponges are sometimes used as %0aa substitute for greasy wool, either with wine and oil, or with %0asalt and water; the only difference being, that wool acts emol- %0aliently upon sores, whereas sponge has an astringent action, %0aand absorbs the vitiated humours. To dropsical patients, ban¬ %0adages of sponge are applied, either dry or steeped in warm %0awater or oxycrate, according as there is a necessity for soothing %0athe skin, or for covering it up and drying it. Sponges are %0aapplied, also, in all those diseases where warmth is required, %0abeing first soaked in boiling water and then squeezed out %0abetween a couple of hoards. Employed in this manner, too, they %0aare very useful for affections of the stomach and for the excessive %0aheats attendant upon fever. Steeped in oxycrate, they are %0agood for diseases of the spleen, and in vinegar for erysipelas ; %0anothing, in fact, being equally efficacious. Sponge, when thus %0aused, should always be so applied as amply to cover the adja¬ %0acent parts that are not affected. %0a%0aEmployed with vinegar or cold water, sponge arrests haemor¬ %0arhage ; soaked in warm salt and water, and frequently renewed, %0ait removes the lividity which results from a recent blow. %0aUsed with oxycrate, it disperses pains and swellings in the %0atestes. To bites inflicted by dogs, it is a good plan to apply %0asponge, from time to time, cut fine, and moistened with %0avinegar, cold water, or honey. Ashes of African 8 sponge, %0awith juice of cut-leek and a mixture of salt and cold water, %0aare good, taken internally, for patients suffering from dis¬ %0acharges of blood: applied topically to the forehead, with oil or %0a» See B. ix. c. 69. %0a%0a%0a522 %0a%0a%0aplint’s natural history. %0a%0a%0a[Book XXXI. %0a%0a%0avinegar, they are curative of tertian fevers. The sponge of %0aAfrica, more particularly, soaked in oxycrate, disperses tu¬ %0amours. Ashes of any kind of sponge burnt with pitch, arrest %0athe discharge of blood from wounds ; though some recommend, %0afor this purpose, the sponge with large pores only, burnt with %0apitch. For affections of the eyes, sponge is burnt in vessels of %0aunbaked earthenware ; the ashes being found highly efficacious %0afor granulations of the eyelids, fleshy excrescences, and all %0adiseases of those parts which require detergents, astringents, %0aor expletives. For all these purposes, however, it is the best %0aplan first to rinse the ashes. "When the body is in a diseased %0astate, sponge acts as a substitute for body-scrapers and linen %0atowels, and it protects the head most efficiently against the %0aaction of the sun. %0a%0aMedical men, in their ignorance, comprehend all sponges %0aunder two names; African sponge, the substance of which is %0atougher and firmer ; and Rhodian sponge, which is softer and %0abetter adapted for fomentations. At the present day, however, %0athe softest sponges of all are those found about the walls of the %0acity of Antiphellos. 9 Trogus informs us that the softest tent %0asponges are found out at sea, off the coast of Lycia, upon spots %0afrom which the sponge has been previously removed: we %0alearn, too, from Polybius, that these fine sponges, suspended %0aover a patient’s bed, will ensure him additional repose at %0anight. 10 %0a%0aWe will now turn to the remedies derived from the marine %0aand aquatic animals. %0a%0aSummary. — Remedies, narratives, and observations, nine %0ahundred and twenty-four. %0a%0aRoman authors quoted. —M.

(1.)—REMARKABLE FACTS CONNECTED WITH WATER. %0a%3c %0a%3c We have now to speak of the benefits derived, in a medicinal %0a%3c point of view, from the aquatic productions ; for not here even %0a%3c has all-bounteous Nature reposed from her work. Amid waves %0a%3c and billows, and tides of rivers for ever on the ebb and flow, %0a%3c she still unceasingly exerts her powers ; and nowhere, if we %0a%3c must confess the truth, does she display herself in greater %0a%3c might, for it is this among the elements that holds sway over %0a%3c all the rest. It is -water that swallows up dry land, that %0a%3c extinguishes flame, that ascends aloft, and challenges posses¬ %0a%3c sion of the very heavens : it is water that, spreading clouds as %0a%3c it does, far and wide, intercepts the vital air we breathe; and, %0a%3c through their collision, gives rise to thunders and lightnings, 1 %0a%3c as the elements of the universe meet in conflict. %0a%3c %0a%3c What can there be more marvellous than waters suspended %0a%3c aloft in the heavens ? And yet, as though it were not enough to %0a%3c reach so high an elevation as this, they sweep along with them %0a%3c whole shoals of fishes, and often stones as -well, thus lading %0a%3c themselves with ponderous masses which belong to other %0a%3c elements, and bearing them on high. Falling upon the earth, %0a%3c these waters become the prime cause of all that is there pro¬ %0a%3c duced ; a truly wondrous provision of Nature, if we only con¬ %0a%3c sider, that in order to give birth to grain and life to trees and %0a%3c to shrubs, water must first leave the earth for the heavens, and %0a%3c thence bring down to vegetation the breath of life! The %0a%3c admission must be surely extorted from us, that for all our %0a%3c resources the earth is indebted to the bounteousness of water. %0a%3c %0a%3c 1 See B. ii. c. 43. Ajasson remarks, that the electric fluid, forming %0a%3c lightning, escapes from the clouds through causes totally independent of %0a%3c water. Still, Pliny would appear to be right in one sense; for if there %0a%3c were no water, there would be no clouds ; and without clouds the electric %0a%3c fluid would probably take some other form than that of lightning. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 472 flint’s natural HISTORY. [Book XXXI. %0a%3c %0a%3c It will be only proper, therefore, in the first place to set forth %0a%3c some instances of the powerful properties displayed by this %0a%3c element; for as to the whole of them, what living mortal could %0a%3c describe them ? %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 2. (2.)— THE DIFFERENT PROPERTIES OF WATERS. %0a%3c %0a%3c On all sides, and in a thousand countries, there are waters %0a%3c bounteously springing forth from the earth, someot them cold, %0a%3c some hot, and some possessed of these properties united : those %0a%3c in the teri'itory of the Tarbelli, 2 for instance, a people of Atjui- %0a%3c tania, and those among the Pyrenoean 3 Mountains, where hot %0a%3c and cold springs are separated by only the very smallest dis¬ %0a%3c tance. Then, again, there are others that are tepid only, or %0a%3c lukewarm, announcing thereby the resources they afford for %0a%3c the treatment of diseases, and bursting forth, for the benefit of %0a%3c man alone, out of so many animated beings. 4 5 %0a%3c %0a%3c Under various names, too, they augment the number of the %0a%3c divinities,® and give birth to cities ; Puteoli, 6 for example, in %0a%3c Campania, Statyellse 7 in Liguria, and Sextise 8 in the province %0a%3c of Gallia Narbonensis. But nowhere do they abound in greater %0a%3c number, or offer a greater variety of medicinal properties than %0a%3c in the Gulf of Baim ; 9 some being impregnated with sulphur, %0a%3c some with alum, some with salt, some with nitre, 10 and some %0a%3c with bitumen, while others are of a mixed quality, partly acid %0a%3c and partly salt. In other cases, again, it is by their vapours %0a%3c that waters are so beneficial to man, being so intensely hot as %0a%3c to heat our baths even, and to make cold water boil in our %0a%3c sitting-baths; such, for instance, as the springs at Baiae, now %0a%3c known as “ Posidian,” after the name of a freedman 11 of the %0a%3c Emperor Claudius; waters which are so hot as to cook articles %0a%3c %0a%3c 2 He alludes to the mineral waters of Acqs or Dax on the Adour, in the %0a%3c French department of the Ariege. They are still highly esteemed. %0a%3c %0a%3c 3 The principal of which are those of Aigues-Chaudes, Aigues-Bonnes, %0a%3c Bagneres-Adores, Cambo, Bagnbres, Bareges, Saint-Sauveur, and Cauteret. %0a%3c %0a%3c 4 Ajasson remarks that animals in all cases refuse to drink mineral waters. %0a%3c %0a%3c 5 He alludes to Neptune, Amphitrite, the Oceanides, Nereides, Tritons, %0a%3c Crenides, Limnades, Potamides, and numerous other minor divinities. %0a%3c %0a%3c 6 See B. iii. c. 9. 7 See B. iii. c. 7. 8 See B. iii. c. 5. %0a%3c %0a%3c 9 The mineral waters of Bairn are still held in high esteem. %0a%3c %0a%3c 1C As to the identity of the “ nitrum ” of Pliny, see c. 46 of this Book. %0a%3c %0a%3c 11 Posides, a eunuch who belonged to the Emperor Claudius, according %0a%3c %0a%3c to Suetonius, c. 28. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 3.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c REMEDIES DEBITED FROM WATER. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 473 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c of food even. There are others, too,—those, for example, %0a%3c formerly the property of Licinius Crassus—which send forth %0a%3c their vapours in the sea 12 even, thus providing resources for the %0a%3c health of man in the very midst of the waves ! %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 3.-REMEDIES DERIVED FROM WATER. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c According to their respective kinds, these waters are bene¬ %0a%3c ficial for diseases of the sinews, feet, or hips, for spraiDS or for %0a%3c fractures; they act, also, as purgatives upon the bowels, heal %0a%3c wounds, 13 and are singularly useful for affections of the head %0a%3c and ears : indeed, the waters of Cicero are good for the eyes. 14 %0a%3c The country-seat where these last are found is worthy of some %0a%3c further mention : travelling from Lake Avernus towards %0a%3c Puteoli, it is to be seen on the sea-shore, renowned for its fine %0a%3c portico and its grove. Cicero gave it the name of Academia, 15 %0a%3c after the place so called at Athens : it was here that he com¬ %0a%3c posed those treatises 16 of his that were called after it; it was %0a%3c here, too, that he raised those monuments 17 to himself; as %0a%3c though, indeed, he had not already done so throughout the %0a%3c length and breadth of the known world. %0a%3c %0a%3c Shortly after the death of Cicero, and when it had come %0a%3c into the possession of Antistius Vetus, 18 certain hot springs %0a%3c burst forth at the very portals 19 of this house, which were %0a%3c found to be remarkably beneficial for diseases of the eyes, and %0a%3c have been celebrated in verse by Laurca Tullius, 20 one of the %0a%3c freedmen of Cicero ; a fact which proves to demonstration that %0a%3c his servants even had received inspiration from that majestic %0a%3c and all-powerful genius of his. I will give the lines, as they %0a%3c deserve to be read, not there only, but everywhere : %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 12 There are still submarine volcanoes in tbe vicinity of Sicily, but the %0a%3c spot here referred to is now unknown. %0a%3c %0a%3c 12 The Eaux Bonnes in the Basses Pyrenees are good for wounds.

Patients suffering from these complaints %0a%3c may be cured also by drinking the waters of Lake Velia j 28 the %0a%3c same effects being produced by those of a spring in Syria, near %0a%3c Mount Taurus, M. Varro says, and by those of the river Callus %0a%3c in Phrygia, as we learn from Callimachus. In taking the waters, %0a%3c however, of this last, the greatest moderation is necessary, as %0a%3c they are apt to cause delirium; an effect equally produced, %0a%3c Ctesias tells us, by the waters of the Red Fountain 22 in %0a%3c ^Ethiopia. %0a%3c %0a%3c 21 We are sensible that, in thus shortening the penultimate, we shall %0a%3c incur the censure of solecizing, which Hardouin has cast upon the poet %0a%3c Claudian for doing the same. %0a%3c %0a%3c 22 At the Torre de’ Bagni, Hardouin says, near the church of Santa %0a%3c Maria a Caudara. %0a%3c %0a%3c 23 Saline and gaseous waters are good for this purpose.

Those of Cutilia, 31 again, in the Sabine %0a%3c territory, are intensely cold, and by a kind of suction penetrate %0a%3c the body to such a degree as to have the effect of a mordent %0a%3c almost. They are remarkably beneficial for affections of the %0a%3c stomach, sinews, and all parts of the body, in fact. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAT. 7.-WATERS PREVENTIVE OF ABORTION. %0a%3c %0a%3c The waters of Thespiae 3 ' 3 ensure conception to females ; the %0a%3c same, too, with those of the river Elatus 33 in Arcadia. The %0a%3c spring Linus, 34 also in Arcadia, acts as a preservative of the %0a%3c fmtus, and effectually prevents abortion.

This water is strongly purgative, is curative of tertian %0a%3c fevers, and disperses urinary calculi: upon the application of %0a%3c fire it assumes a turbid appearance, and finally turns red. The %0a%3c springs 41 of Lcucogsea, between Puteoli and Xeapolis, are %0a%3c curative of eye diseases and of wounds. Cicero, in his work %0a%3c entitled “ Admiranda,” 42 has remarked that it is only by the %0a%3c waters of the marshes of Keate 43 that the hoofs of beasts of %0a%3c burden are hardened. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 9.- WATERS WHICH COLOUR THE HAIR. %0a%3c %0a%3c Eudicus informs us that in Hestiseotis 44 there are two %0a%3c springs; one of which, Cerona, renders sheep black that drink %0a%3c of it, ivhile the other, called Neleus, turns them white: if, %0a%3c again, a sheep should happen to drink their waters mixed, its %0a%3c fleece will be mottled. According to Theophrastus, the water %0a%3c of the Crathis, 45 a river of Thurii, makes sheep and cattle %0a%3c white, while that of the river Sybaris turns them black. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 10.-WATERS WHICH COLOUR THE HUMAN BODY. %0a%3c %0a%3c And not only this, but human beings even, Theophrastus %0a%3c tells us, are sensible of this difference : for persons who drink %0a%3c the water of the Sybaris, he says, become more swarthy and %0a%3c more hardy, the hair inclining to curl: while those, again, %0a%3c w r ho drink of the Crathis become fair and more soft-skinned, %0a%3c with the hair growing straight and long. So, too, in Mace¬ %0a%3c donia, persons who wish the produce to be white, drive their %0a%3c cattle to the river Haliacmon, while those who desire a black %0a%3c or tawny colour, take them to. water at the Axius.

WATERS IN WHICH %0a%3c %0a%3c NOTHING WILL SINK. %0a%3c %0a%3c If any of the above-mentioned facts have the appearance %0a%3c of being incredible to a person, I would have him know that %0a%3c there is no department of Nature which presents greater mar¬ %0a%3c vels than this, independently of the numerous peculiarities %0a%3c which have befen already mentioned 64 in an earlier part of this %0a%3c work. Ctesias informs us that, in India, there is a lake of %0a%3c standing water, upon which nothing 65 will float, every object %0a%3c instantly sinking to the bottom. Cselius says that in the %0a%3c ■waters of Lake Avernus, 66 in our own part of the world, the' %0a%3c very leaves of the trees even will sink; and, according to %0a%3c Varro, these waters are fatal to such birds as fly towards them. %0a%3c %0a%3c On the other hand, again, in the waters of Lake Apuscida- %0a%3c mus, 67 in Africa, nothing will sink ; the same, too, Apion tells %0a%3c %0a%3c 60 From eXatuv, “to weep,” and ytXpV, “to laugh.” %0a%3c %0a%3c 61 His credulity, we have seen already, was pretty extensive. %0a%3c %0a%3c 62 In Thessaly. %0a%3c %0a%3c 63 At the town called “ Aquae Mattiacrc,” the modern Wiesbaden. %0a%3c %0a%3c 64 In B. ii. c. 100. %0a%3c %0a%3c 63 Sotion, professing to quote from Ctesias, says that it rejected everything %0a%3c placed on its waters, and hurled it back upon dry land. %0a%3c %0a%3c 66 Whence, as it was said, its name, uo^voq, “ Without birds.” Strabo %0a%3c ridicules this story. _ . . %0a%3c %0a%3c « M.

The spring ot Li- %0a%3c myra 68 not unfrequently makes its way through the neigh¬ %0a%3c bouring localities, and when it does so, is always portentous of %0a%3c some coming event. It is a singular thing too, that the fish %0a%3c always accompany its waters on these occasions; the inha¬ %0a%3c bitants of the adjoining districts being in the habit of consult¬ %0a%3c ing them by offering them food. When the fishes seize it witli %0a%3c avidity, the answer is supposed to be favourable ; but if, on the %0a%3c other hand, they reject the food, by flapping it with their tails, %0a%3c the response is considered to be unfavourable. The river %0a%3c Holcas, in Bithynia, runs close to Bryazus, 69 the name of a %0a%3c temple and of a divinity there worshipped ; persons guilty of %0a%3c perjury, it is said, cannot endure contact with its waters, %0a%3c which burn like flame. 10 %0a%3c %0a%3c The sources, too, of the Tamaricus, 71 a river of Cantabria, %0a%3c are considered to possess certain powers of presaging future %0a%3c events : they are three in number, and, separated solely by an %0a%3c interval of eight feet, unite in one channel, and so form a mighty %0a%3c stream. These springs are often dry a dozen times in the day, %0a%3c sometimes as many as twenty, without there being the slight¬ %0a%3c est trace of water there: while, on the other hand, a spring %0a%3c close at hand is flowing abundantly and without intermission. %0a%3c It is considered an evil presage when persons who wish to see %0a%3c these springs find them dry : a circumstance which happened %0a%3c very recently, for example, to Lartius Licinius, 12 who held the %0a%3c office of legatus after his praetorship ; for at the end of seven %0a%3c days after his visit he died. %0a%3c %0a%3c In Judaea there is a river 73 that is dry every Sabbath day. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 19.- DEADLY WATERS.

Ctesias states in his writings, that there %0a%3c is a spring in Armenia, the fishes in which are black, 74 and, if %0a%3c used as food, productive of instantaneous death. I have heard %0a%3c the same, too, with reference to the waters near the sources %0a%3c of the river Danuvius, 75 until a spring is reached which is %0a%3c near its main channel, and beyond which this poisonous kind %0a%3c of fish is not to be found. Hence it is that this spot is gene¬ %0a%3c rally looked upon as the source of the river. The same, too, is %0a%3c reported of the Lake of the Nymphs, in Lydia. Near the river %0a%3c Pheneus, in Achaia, there flows from the rocks a spring known %0a%3c as the Styx, the waters of which, as already 76 stated, are in¬ %0a%3c stantly fatal. And not only this, but there are also small fish %0a%3c in it, Theophrastus says, which are as deadly as the water, %0a%3c a thing that is not the case with the fish of any other poison¬ %0a%3c ous springs. Theopompus says, that at the town of Cychri, %0a%3c in Thrace, the waters are deadly; and Lycus states, that at %0a%3c Leontium 77 there is a spring, the waters of which are fatal at %0a%3c the end of a couple of days to those who drink thereof. Yarro %0a%3c speaks also of a spring upon Mount Soracte, some four feet in %0a%3c breadth, the waters of which bubble forth at sunrise, as though %0a%3c they were boiling; birds, he says, which only taste thereof, %0a%3c fall dead close by. %0a%3c %0a%3c And then, besides, we meet with this insidious circumstance, %0a%3c that in some cases, waters of this nature are inviting even in %0a%3c their appearance ; those at Nonacris, in Arcadia, for example, %0a%3c the water of which fountain possesses no apparent quality to %0a%3c excite mistrust, though, owing to its intense coldness, it is %0a%3c generally looked upon as highly injurious, seeing that it petri¬ %0a%3c fies as it flows. It is otherwise with the waters of Tempe, %0a%3c in Thessaly, their baneful properties inspiring universal terror, %0a%3c and possessing the property of corroding copper even and %0a%3c iron, it is said. This stream runs a short distance only, as %0a%3c already stated ; 78 and it is truly marvellous that, according %0a%3c to general report, the banks of its source 79 are surrounded with %0a%3c the roots of a wild carob, 80 always covered with purple flowers, %0a%3c %0a%3c 74 Ajasson thinks that he means, grey.

At Eury- %0a%3c menae, 83 chaplets, when thrown into the waters of a certain foun¬ %0a%3c tain there, are turned to stone. At Colossae there is a river, into %0a%3c the water of which if bricks 84 are thrown, when taken out they %0a%3c are found changed into stone. In the mines of Scyros, the trees %0a%3c petrify that are watered by the river, branches and all. In %0a%3c the caverns of Mount Corycus, the drops of water that trickle %0a%3c down the rocks become hard in the form of a stone. 85 At %0a%3c Mieza, too, in Macedonia, the water petrifies as it hangs from %0a%3c the vaulted roofs of the rocks; but at Corycus it is only when %0a%3c it has fallen that it becomes hard. %0a%3c %0a%3c In other caverns, again, the water petrifies both ways, 86 and %0a%3c so forms columns; as we find the case in a vast grotto at Phau- %0a%3c sia, a town of the Chersonesus 87 of the Rhodians, the columns %0a%3c of which are tinted with various colours. These instances will %0a%3c suffice for the present. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 21. (3.)-THE WHOLESOMENESS OF WATERS. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is a subject of enquiry among medical men, which kind %0a%3c of tvater is the most beneficial.

Hence it %0a%3c is that I am much surprised that persons should be found to %0a%3c set so high a value as they do, upon cistern water. These lasW %0a%3c give as their reason, however, that rain-water must be the %0a%3c lightest water of all, seeing that it has been able to rise 8S aloft ^ %0a%3c and remain suspended in the air. Hence it is, too, that they %0a%3c prefer snow-water to rain-water, and ice, again, to snow, as * %0a%3c being water subtilized to the highest possible degree ; on the %0a%3c ground that snow-water and ice-water must be lighter than %0a%3c ordinary water, and ice, of necessity, considerably lighter. It %0a%3c is for the general interest, however, of mankind, that these %0a%3c notions should be refuted. Tor, in the first place, this com¬ %0a%3c parative lightness which they speak of, could hardly be ascer¬ %0a%3c tained in any other way than by the sensation, there being %0a%3c pretty nearly no difference at all in weight between the kinds of %0a%3c water. Hor yet, in the case of rain-water, is it any proof of %0a%3c its lightness that it has made its way upwards into the air, %0a%3c seeing that stones," it is quite evident, do the same : and then, %0a%3c besides, this water, while falling, must of necessity become %0a%3c tainted with the vapours which rise from the earth ; a circum¬ %0a%3c stance owing to which it is, that such numerous impurities 90 %0a%3c are to be detected in rain-water, and that it ferments 91 with %0a%3c such extreme rapidity. %0a%3c %0a%3c I am, surprised, too, that snow 92 and ice should be regarded %0a%3c as the most subtilized states of this element, in juxtaposition %0a%3c with the proofs supplied us by hail, the water of which, it is %0a%3c generally agreed, is the most pernicious of all to drink. And %0a%3c then, besides, there are not a few among the medical men %0a%3c themselves, who assert that the use of ice-water and snow¬ %0a%3c water is highly injurious, from the circumstance that all the %0a%3c more refined parts thereof have been expelled by congelation. %0a%3c %0a%3c At all events, it is a well-ascertained fact that the volume of %0a%3c every liquid is diminished by congelation; as also that exces- %0a%3c %0a%3c Rain-water really is the lightest, but the reason here given is frivolous, %0a%3c for it does not ascend as water, but as vapour. %0a%3c %0a%3c 89 See B. ii. c. 38. Before venturing on this argument, he should have %0a%3c been certain as to the circumstances under which aerolites are generated, a %0a%3c question which still remains hidden in mystery. _ %0a%3c %0a%3c w Ajasson remarks that this is only the case in the water of heavy falls %0a%3c of rain after long drought. 91 “Calefiat.” %0a%3c %0a%3c 92 Snow-water is pernicious in a very high degree, being the fruitful %0a%3c source of goitre and cretinism. %0a%3c %0a%3c I I 2 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 484 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c print's natural itistory. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XXXI. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c sive dews 93 * a reproductive of blight in com, and that hoar¬ %0a%3c frosts result in blast; of a kindred nature, both of them to %0a%3c snow. It is generally agreed, too, that rain-water putrefies %0a%3c with the greatest rapidity, and that it keeps but very badly on %0a%3c a voyage. Epigenes, however, assures us that water which %0a%3c has putrefied seven times and as often purified 93 itself, will no %0a%3c longer be liable to putrefaction. As to cistern-water, medical %0a%3c men assure us that, owing to its harshness, it is bad for the %0a%3c bowels and throat ; w and it is generally admitted by them that %0a%3c there is no kind of water that contains more slime or more %0a%3c numerous insects of a disgusting nature. Hut it does not, %0a%3c therefore, follow that river water is the best of all, or that, in %0a%3c fact, of any running stream, the water of many lakes being %0a%3c found to be wholesome in the very highest degree. %0a%3c %0a%3c What water, then, out of all these various kinds, are we to %0a%3c look upon as best adapted for the human constitution ? Dif¬ %0a%3c ferent kinds in different localities, is my answer^/The kings %0a%3c of Parthia drink no water but that of the Choaspes 95 or of the %0a%3c Eulseus, and, however long their joumies, they always have %0a%3c this water carried in their suite. And yet it is very evident , %0a%3c that it is not merely because this water is river-water that it* %0a%3c is thus pleasing to them, seeing that they decline to drink the %0a%3c water of the Tigris, Euphrates, and so many other streams. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 22.-THE IMPURITIES OF WATER. %0a%3c %0a%3c Slime 96 is one great impurity of water: still, however, if a %0a%3c river of this description is full of eels, it is generally looked %0a%3c upon as a proof 97 of the salubrity of its water; just as it is %0a%3c regarded as a sign of its freshness when long worms 98 breed in %0a%3c the water of a spring. But it is bitter water, more particu¬ %0a%3c larly, that is held in disesteem, as also the water which swells %0a%3c the stomach the moment it is drunk, a property which belongs %0a%3c %0a%3c 9s* See B. xvii. c. 44, and B. xviii. c. 68. %0a%3c %0a%3c 93 This is somewhat similar to what is said of the putrefaction and %0a%3c purification of Thames water, on a voyage. %0a%3c %0a%3c 94 “ Inutilis alvo duritia faucibusque.” The passage is probably corrupt. %0a%3c %0a%3c 95 See B. vi. c. 27. %0a%3c %0a%3c 96 Or “ mud ”—“ limus.” All rivers of necessity have it, in a greater or %0a%3c less degree. %0a%3c %0a%3c 97 On the contrary, the more the mud and slime, the more numerous the %0a%3c %0a%3c eels, 99 “lamias.” %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 23.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c MODES OP TESTING WATEB. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 485 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c to the water at Troezen.

It is a good plan, too, to observe if water leaves %0a%3c stains upon copper vessels; if leguminous vegetables boil with %0a%3c difficulty in it; if, when gently decanted, it leaves an earthy %0a%3c deposit; or if, when boiled, it covers the vessel with a thick %0a%3c crust. 3 %0a%3c %0a%3c It is a fault also in water, 3 * not only to have a bad smell, 4 %0a%3c but to have any flavour 5 at all, even though it be. a flavour %0a%3c pleasant and agreeable in itself, or closely approaching, as we %0a%3c often find the case, the taste of milk. Water, to be truly %0a%3c wholesome, ought to resemble air G as much as possible. . There %0a%3c is only one 7 spring of water in the whole universe, it is said, %0a%3c that has an agreeable smell, that ot Chabura, namely, in Me¬ %0a%3c sopotamia : the people give a fabulous reason tor it, and say %0a%3c that it is because Juno 8 bathed there. Speaking in general %0a%3c terms, water, to be wholesome, should have neither taste nor %0a%3c smell. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 23.-THE MODES OF TESTING WATEK. %0a%3c %0a%3c Some persons judge of the wholesomeness of water through %0a%3c the agency of a balance : 9 their pains, however, are expended %0a%3c to little purpose, it being but very rarely that one water is %0a%3c %0a%3c 99 'Waters, probably, impregnated with mineral alkali.

There is, however, a more certain mode %0a%3c of ascertaining the difference in quality, that water being the %0a%3c better of the two which becomes hot and cold with the greatest %0a%3c rapidity : in addition to which, not to keep poising a balance , 10 %0a%3c after w r ater has been drawn up in vessels, if it is good, it should %0a%3c gradually become warmer, they say, when placed upon the %0a%3c ground. Which xvater, then, of the several kinds will be %0a%3c most likely to be good and wholesome ? Well-water, no doubt/ %0a%3c if we are to judge from the general use made of it in cities: %0a%3c but only in the case of wells in which it is kept in continual %0a%3c agitation by repeated drawing, and is refined by the earth acting^ %0a%3c as a filter. These conditions are sufficient to ensure salubrity %0a%3c in water : in regard to coolness, the well must be in a shaded* %0a%3c spot, and the water kept exposed to the air. There is, however, %0a%3c one thing above all to be observed, a point, too, of considerable %0a%3c importance with reference to the continuance of the flow—the %0a%3c spring must issue from the bed of the well, and not from the * %0a%3c sides. To make water cold to the touch may be effected arti¬ %0a%3c ficially even, either by forcing it to rise aloft or by making it %0a%3c fall from a height, and so come in collision with the air, and be¬ %0a%3c come incorporated * 1 therewith: for in swimming , 12 we find, %0a%3c when we hold our breath, the water is felt to be all the colder. %0a%3c %0a%3c It was the Emperor Nero’s invention 13 to boil water, and*' %0a%3c %0a%3c Vxhen enclose it in glass vessels and cool it in snow ; a method %0a%3c which ensures all the enjoyment of a cold beverage, without any %0a%3c of the inconveniences resulting from the use of snow. Indeed, it %0a%3c is generally admitted that all water is more 14 wholesome when %0a%3c %0a%3c very impure water. Synesius, Ep. xv., gives an account of the “ hydros- %0a%3c copium ” used by the ancients for ascertaining the weight of water. Beck¬ %0a%3c mann enters into a lengthy examination of it, as also an enquiry into the %0a%3c question whether the ancients, and among them Pliny, were acquainted %0a%3c with the hydrometer. See his Hist. Inv. Yol. II. pp. 163—169. Bohn's Ed. %0a%3c %0a%3c ly “ Ne manus pendeaijt.” These words, which Hardouin pronounces %0a%3c to be full of obscurity, have caused considerable discussion. The passage %0a%3c appears to be imperfect, but it is not improbable that he alludes to the use %0a%3c ot the balance or scales for ascertaining the comparative wholesomeness of %0a%3c water. . _ 11 “ Corripiat.” %0a%3c %0a%3c The thread of his reasoning is not very perceptible; but he seems to %0a%3c mean that the more air there is in a body the colder it is. If the air is %0a%3c inhaled by a person when eating peppermint, he will be sensible of a cold %0a%3c feeling in the mouth. %0a%3c %0a%3c * 13 Galen believes this method to have been known to Hippocrates, and %0a%3c %0a%3c Aristotle was undoubtedly acquainted with it.

Cold water, taken inter¬ %0a%3c nally, arrests haemorrhage.By keeping cold water in his %0a%3c mouth, a person may render himself proof against the intense %0a%3c heat of the bath. Many a person knows by his own every-day %0a%3c experience, that water which is the coldest to drink is not of %0a%3c necessity the coldest to the touch, this delightful property being %0a%3c subject to considerable fluctuations . 17 %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 24 .- THE MAECIAN WATEES. %0a%3c %0a%3c The most celebrated water throughout the whole world, and %0a%3c the one to which our city gives the palm for coolness and salu¬ %0a%3c brity, is that of the Marcian 18 Spring, accorded to Home among %0a%3c the other bounties of the gods : the name formerly given to %0a%3c the stream was the “ Aufeian,” the spring itself being known %0a%3c as “ Pitonia.” It rises ’ 9 at the extremity of the mountains of %0a%3c the Peligni, passes through the territory of the Marsi and through %0a%3c Lake Fucinus, and then, without deviating, makes directly for %0a%3c Rome : shortly after this, it loses itself iu certain caverns, and %0a%3c only reappears in the territory of Tibur, from which it is %0a%3c brought to the City by an arched aqueduct nine miles in %0a%3c length. Ancus Marcius, one of the Roman kings, was the %0a%3c first 20 who thought cf introducing this water into the City. %0a%3c At a later period, the vorks were repaired by Quintus Mar¬ %0a%3c cius Rex: and, more recently, in his praetorship, by M. %0a%3c Agrippa . 21 %0a%3c %0a%3c 15 “ Magis refrigerari.” The experiments made by Mariotte, Perrault, %0a%3c the Academy del Cimento, Mariana,and others, showed no perceptible differ¬ %0a%3c ence in the time of freezing, betweei boiled and unboiled water; but the %0a%3c former produced ice harder and clearer, the latter ice more full of blisters. %0a%3c In later times, Dr. Black, of Edinburgh has from his experiments asserted %0a%3c the contrary. “ Boiled water,” he says, “ becomes ice sooner than unboiled, %0a%3c if the latter be left at perfect rest.” Becknann’s Hist.

Near these %0a%3c waters is the stream of Hercules, which the former shun, to %0a%3c all appearance, and have thence obtained 23 the name of “Virgin %0a%3c Waters.” On instituting a comparison between the waters of %0a%3c these streams, the difference above-mentioned 24 may be imme¬ %0a%3c diately detected, the Virgin water being as much cooler to %0a%3c the touch, as the Marcian water is in taste. And yet, for this %0a%3c long time past, the pleasure of drinking these waters has been %0a%3c lost to the City, owing to the ambition and avarice of certain %0a%3c persons who have turned 25 them out of their course for the %0a%3c supply of their country-seats and of various places in the suburbs, %0a%3c to the great detriment of the public health. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 26 . -THE METHOD OF SEARCHING FOR WATER. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c It will not be out of place to append here an account of the %0a%3c method employed in searching for water. Water is mostly to %0a%3c N be found in valleys, whether formed by the intersection of de¬ %0a%3c clivities or lying at the lower part of mountaias. Many per¬ %0a%3c sons have been of opinion that all places with a northern 36 %0a%3c aspect are naturally provided with water: a point upon which %0a%3c it will not be amiss to explain the diversities presented to us %0a%3c by Nature. On the south side of the mountains of Ilyrcania %0a%3c it never rains; and hence it is that it is only on the north¬ %0a%3c east side that they are wooded. As for Olympus, Ossa, Par¬ %0a%3c nassus, the Apennines, and the Alps, they are covered with %0a%3c wood on every side, and abundantly watered with streams. %0a%3c Some mountains, again, are wooded on the south side, the %0a%3c White 27 Mountains in Crete, /or example. On this point, %0a%3c therefore, we may come to th* conclusion that there is no rule %0a%3c which in all cases holds good %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 23 ‘‘Aqua Virgo.” This aqivduct, erected a.u.c. 735, stiU exists, and %0a%3c bears the name of “ Aqua Verpne. ’ %0a%3c %0a%3c 23 Another story was, that i had this name from the circumstance that %0a%3c the spring was first pointed oitby a girl to some soldiers in search of water. %0a%3c ** In c. 23 of this Book. %0a%3c %0a%3c 25 This was only temporsrily, in all probability %0a%3c %0a%3c “ I here ) , S !, CI ? 8 ' a8he sa/S bel0 I’ . t0 be D0 general rule as to this point. %0a%3c ** bo called from the srow on their summit. ^ %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 28.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c DIFFERENCES Ilf WATEE8. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 489 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 27 . -SIGNS INDICATIVE OF THE PRESENCE OF WATER. %0a%3c %0a%3c The following are indications of the presence of water :—■ %0a%3c rushes, reeds, the plant mentioned with reference to this point %0a%3c already , 28 or frogs sitting squatted on a spot for a long time %0a%3c together. As to the wild 29 willow, alder, vitex, reed, and ivy, %0a%3c all of which grow spontaneously on low grounds in which %0a%3c there is a settling of rain water from higher localities, con¬ %0a%3c sidered as indications of the presence of water, they are all 30 of %0a%3c them of a deceptive nature. A sign much more to be depended %0a%3c upon, is a certain misty exhalation, visible from a distance %0a%3c before sunrise. The better to observe this, some persons ascend %0a%3c an eminence, and lie flat at full length upon the ground, with %0a%3c the chin touching the earth. There is also another peculiar %0a%3c method of judging upon this point, known only to men of %0a%3c experience in these matters : in the very middle of the heats %0a%3c of summer they select the hottest hours of the day, and observe %0a%3c how the sun’s rays are reflected in each spot; and if, notwith¬ %0a%3c standing the general dryness of the earth, a locality is observed %0a%3c to present a moist appearance, they make no doubt of finding %0a%3c water there. %0a%3c %0a%3c But so intense is the stress upon the eyes in doing this, that %0a%3c it is very apt to make them ache; to avoid which inconveni¬ %0a%3c ence, they have recourse to other modes of testing. They dig %0a%3c a hole, for instance, some five feet in depth, and cover it with %0a%3c vessels of unbaked pottery, or with a copper basin well-oiled ; %0a%3c they then place a burning lamp on the spot, with an arch-work %0a%3c over it of leaves, and covered with earth on the top. If, after a %0a%3c time, they find the pots wet or broken, the copper covered with %0a%3c moisture, or the lamp extinguished, but not from want of oil, or %0a%3c if a lock of wool that has been left there is found to be moist, %0a%3c it is a sign of the presence of water, beyond all doubt. With %0a%3c some persons it is the practice to light a fire on the spot before %0a%3c they dig the hole, a method which renders the experiment with %0a%3c the vessels still more conclusive. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 28.— DIFFERENCES IN WATERS, ACCORDING TO THE NATURE %0a%3c OF THE SOIL. %0a%3c %0a%3c The soil itself, too, gives indications of the presence of %0a%3c %0a%3c 28 In B. xxvi. c. 16. 29 “ Salix erratica.” %0a%3c %0a%3c 30 Surely not the reed, as he has mentioned it above as one of the in¬ %0a%3c dications to be depended upon.

The presence of potter’s clay %0a%3c always puts an end to all hopes of finding water, and the ex¬ %0a%3c cavation is immediately abandoned; an eye being carefully %0a%3c kept to the strata 31 of the earth, to see whether, beginning %0a%3c Avith black mould, it successively presents the appearances %0a%3c above-mentioned. The water is always fresh that is found %0a%3c in argillaceous soils, but in a stratum of tufa it is colder than %0a%3c elsewhere; this, indeed, being a soil which is highly approved %0a%3c of, as having a tendency to make the water pure and extremely %0a%3c light to the stomach, and, by its action as a filter, to Avithhold %0a%3c all impurities. The presence of sand 33 gives indications of %0a%3c springs of but limited extent, and of Avater impregnated with %0a%3c slime; Avhile that of gravel announces the presence of water of %0a%3c excellent flavour, but not to be depended upon for permanence. %0a%3c Male 33 sand, fine sea 3 ' 1 -sand, and charcoal 35 earth, yield a con¬ %0a%3c stant supply of water of a highly wholesome quality; but it %0a%3c is the presence of red stones that is the most to be depended %0a%3c upon, and the water found there is of the very finest quality. %0a%3c Craggy localities at the foot of mountains, and silicious soils, %0a%3c are equally good; in addition to which, the water found there %0a%3c is cooler than elsewhere. %0a%3c %0a%3c In boring for water, the soil should always become more %0a%3c and more humid, and, the deeper the descent, with the greater %0a%3c facility the implements should penetrate. In deep-sunk wells, %0a%3c the presence of sulphureous 36 or aluminous substances is fatal %0a%3c to the sinkers; a danger that may be guarded against by letting %0a%3c down a lighted lamp, and ascertaining whether the flame is %0a%3c extinguished. When such is found to be the case, it is the %0a%3c practice to sink vent-holes on each side of the well, both right %0a%3c and left, in order to receive and carry off the noxious exhala¬ %0a%3c tions. Independently of these evils, the air becomes heavier, %0a%3c from the great depth merely of the excavation, an inconvenience %0a%3c which is remedied by keeping up a continual circulation with %0a%3c ventilators of linen cloth.

Others, again, are coldest at %0a%3c the rising of the Dog-star—peculiarities, both of them, to be %0a%3c witnessed at Pella in Macedonia ; for in front of that city there %0a%3c is a marsh-spring, which at the beginning of summer is cold, %0a%3c while in the more elevated parts of the city the water is ice- %0a%3c cold 38 in the hottest days of summer. The same is the case, %0a%3c too, at Chios, the water-supply of the harbour and of the %0a%3c city occupying the same relative positions. At Athens, the %0a%3c water of the Fountain Enneacrunos 39 is colder in a cloudy %0a%3c summer than the well there in the garden of Jupiter; while %0a%3c on the other hand, this last is ice-cold during the drought of a %0a%3c hot summer. For the most part, however, wells are coldest %0a%3c about the rising of Arcturus. 10 %0a%3c %0a%3c (4.) The water-supply of wells never fails in summer, but %0a%3c in all cases it falls low during four days at the rising of the %0a%3c constellation above-mentioned. Throughout the whole winter, %0a%3c on the other hand, many wells entirely fail; as in the neigh¬ %0a%3c bourhood of Olynthus, for example, where the water returns %0a%3c in the early days of spring. In Sicily too, in the vicinity of %0a%3c Messana and Mylae, the springs are entirely dry throughout %0a%3c the winter, while in summer they overflow and form quite a %0a%3c river. At Apollonia in Pontus there is to be seen, near the %0a%3c sea-shore, a fountain which overflows in summer only, and %0a%3c mostly about the rising of the Dog-star; should the summer, %0a%3c however, not be so hot as usual, its water is less abundant. %0a%3c Certain soils become drier in consequence of rain, that in the %0a%3c territory of Narnia for example : a fact which M. Cicero has %0a%3c mentioned in his “ Admiranda,” with a statement that drought %0a%3c is there productive of mud, and rain of dust. 41 %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 29. -THE QUALITIES OF WATEB AT THE DIFFERENT SEASONS %0a%3c %0a%3c OF THE TEAR. %0a%3c %0a%3c Every kind of water is freshest in winter, not so fresh in %0a%3c 37 “ Arenatum.” Properly a mortar, which consisted of one part lime %0a%3c and two parts sand. 38 “ Riget.” %0a%3c %0a%3c 39 See B. iv. c. 11.

For the quality of water, in fact, depends upon the %0a%3c nature of the soil through which it flows, and the juices 12 of %0a%3c the vegetation watered by it; hence it is that the water of the %0a%3c same river is found in some spots to be comparatively un¬ %0a%3c wholesome. The confluents, too, of rivers, are apt to change the %0a%3c flavour of the water, impregnating the stream in which they %0a%3c are lost and absorbed; as in the case of the Borysthenes, for %0a%3c example. In some instances, again, the taste of river-water is %0a%3c changed by the fall of heavy rains. It has happened three %0a%3c times in the Bosporus that there has been a fall of salt rain, a %0a%3c phaenomenon which proved fatal to the crops. On three occa¬ %0a%3c sions, also, the rains have imparted a bitterness to the over¬ %0a%3c flowing streams of the Nilus, which was productive of great %0a%3c pestilence throughout Egypt. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 30. -HISTORICAL observations upon waters which have %0a%3c %0a%3c SUBBENLY MABE THEIR APPEARANCE OR SUBBENLY CEA8EB. %0a%3c %0a%3c It frequently happens that in spots where forests have been %0a%3c felled, springs of water make 13 their appearance, the supply of %0a%3c which was previously expended in the nutriment of the trees. %0a%3c This was the case upon Mount Heemus for example, when, %0a%3c during the siege by Cassander, 11 the Gauls cut down a forest %0a%3c for the purpose of making a rampart. Very often too, after %0a%3c removing the wood which has covered an elevated spot and %0a%3c so served to attract and consume the rains, devastating torrents %0a%3c are formed by the concentration of the waters. It is very im¬ %0a%3c portant also, for the maintenance of a constant supply of %0a%3c water, to till the ground and keep it constantly in motion, %0a%3c taking care to break and loosen the callosities of the surface %0a%3c crust: at all events, we find it stated, that upon a city of %0a%3c Crete, Arcadia by name, being razed to the ground, the springs %0a%3c and water-courses, which before were very numerous in that %0a%3c locality, all at once dried up ; but that, six years after, when %0a%3c %0a%3c 43 See B. ii. c. 106. %0a%3c %0a%3c 43 Ajasson remarks, that just the converse of this has been proved by %0a%3c modern experience to be the case. %0a%3c %0a%3c 44 The son of Antipater, then acting for Alexander during his absence %0a%3c in the East. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 30.] WATERS WHICH HAVE SUDDENLY APPEARED. 493 %0a%3c %0a%3c the city was rebuilt, the water again made its appearance, just %0a%3c as each spot was again brought into cultivation. %0a%3c %0a%3c (5.) Earthquakes also are apt to discover or swallow 45 up %0a%3c springs of water; a thiDg that has happened, it is well known, %0a%3c on five different occasions in the vicinity of Pheneus, a town of %0a%3c Arcadia. So too, upon Mount Corycus, 46 a river burst forth ; %0a%3c after which, the soil was subjected to cultivation. These %0a%3c changes are very surprising where there is no apparent cause %0a%3c for them; such as the occurrence at Magnesia, 47 for instance, %0a%3c where the warm waters became cold, but without losing their %0a%3c brackish flavour; and at the Temple 4 * of Neptune in Cana, %0a%3c where the water of the river, from being fresh, became salt. %0a%3c Here, too, is another fact, replete with the marvellous—the %0a%3c fountain of Arethusa at Syracuse has a smell of dung, they say, %0a%3c during the celebration of the games at Olympia, 49 a thing that %0a%3c is rendered not improbable by the circumstance, 50 that the river %0a%3c Alpheus makes its way to that island beneath the bed of the %0a%3c sea. There is a spring in the Chersonesus of the lthodians 50 * %0a%3c which discharges its accumulated impurities every nine years. %0a%3c %0a%3c Waters, too, sometimes change their colour; as at Babylon, %0a%3c for example, where the water of a certain lake for eleven days %0a%3c in summer is red. In the summer season, too, the current of %0a%3c the Borysthenes 51 is blue, it is said, and this, although its %0a%3c waters are the most rarefied in existence, and hence float upon %0a%3c the surface of those of the Hypanis ; 52 —though at the same time %0a%3c there is this marvellous fact, that when south winds prevail, the %0a%3c waters of the Hypanis assume the upper place. Another proof, %0a%3c too, of the surpassing lightness of the water of the Borysthenes, %0a%3c is the fact that it emits no exhalations, nor indeed, the slightest %0a%3c vapour even. Authors that would have the credit of diligent %0a%3c research in these enquiries, assure us that water becomes %0a%3c heavier after the winter-solstice. %0a%3c %0a%3c « q R ii p 84 46 In Cilicia. %0a%3c %0a%3c 47 Whether he means the district of Thessaly so called, or one of the %0a%3c two Pities of that uame in Lydia, does not appear to be known %0a%3c 18 Its locality is unknown, but it was probably near the sea-shore. %0a%3c %0a%3c Z Kis^Xlhy ' JSi by the popular story that the river Alpheus %0a%3c in Peloponnesus, ^n its love for the Fountain W Are husa,penerated %0a%3c beneath the bed of the sea, and reappeared in Sicily.

(6.) - THE METHOD OF CONVEYING WATER. %0a%3c %0a%3c The most convenient method of making a watercourse from %0a%3c the spring is by employing earthen pipes, two fingers in thick¬ %0a%3c ness, inserted in one another at the points of junction—the one %0a%3c that has the higher inclination fitting into the lower one—and %0a%3c coated with quick-lime macerated in oil. The inclination, to %0a%3c ensure the free flow of the water, ought to be at least one-fourth %0a%3c of an inch to every hundred feet; and if the water is conveyed %0a%3c through a subterraneous passage, there should be air-holes let in %0a%3c at intervals of every two 53 actus. Where the water is wanted %0a%3c to ascend 34 aloft, it should be conveyed in pipes of lead: %0a%3c water, it should be remembered, always rises to the level of its %0a%3c source. If, again, it is conveyed from a considerable distance, %0a%3c it should be made to rise and fall every now and then, so as %0a%3c not to lose its motive pow r er. The proper length for each %0a%3c leaden pipe is ten feet; and if 65 the pipe is five fingers in cir¬ %0a%3c cumference its weight should be sixty pounds; if eight feet, %0a%3c one hundred ; if ten, one hundred and twenty ; and so on in the %0a%3c same proportion. %0a%3c %0a%3c A pipe is called “a ten-finger” 56 pipe when the sheet of %0a%3c metal is ten fingers in breadth before it is rolled up ; a sheet %0a%3c one half that breadth giving a pipe “ of five fingers.” 5 ' In all %0a%3c sudden changes of inclination in elevated localities, pipes of %0a%3c five fingers should be employed, in order to break the impetu¬ %0a%3c osity of the fall: reservoirs, 68 too, for branches should be made %0a%3c as circumstances may demand. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 32 —HOW MINEKAL WATERS SHOULD BE USED. %0a%3c %0a%3c I am surprised that Homer has made no 59 mention of hot %0a%3c springs, when, on the other hand, he has so frequently intro¬ %0a%3c duced the mention of warm baths: a circumstance from which %0a%3c we may safely conclude that recourse was not had in his time %0a%3c to mineral waters for their medicinal properties, a thing so %0a%3c universally the case at the present day.

This last operation, however, is com¬ %0a%3c monly regarded as altogether foreign to the use of mineral baths; %0a%3c and hence it is, that there is no situation in which men’s %0a%3c bodies are more exposed to the chances of disease, the head %0a%3c becoming saturated with the intensity of the odours exhaled, %0a%3c and Left exposed, perspiring as it is, to the coldness of the %0a%3c atmosphere, while all the rest of the body is immersed in the %0a%3c %0a%3c water. 64 ... %0a%3c %0a%3c There is another mistake, also, of a similar description, made %0a%3c by those who pride themselves upon drinking enormous %0a%3c quantities of these waters ; 65 and I myself have seen persons, %0a%3c before now, so swollen with drinking it that the very rings on %0a%3c their fingers were entirely concealed by the skin, owing to %0a%3c their inability to discharge the vast quantities of water which %0a%3c they had swallowed. It is for this reason, too, that these %0a%3c waters should never be drunk without taking a taste of salt %0a%3c every now and then. The very mud, n> too, ot mineral spiings %0a%3c may be employed to good purpose; but, to be effectual, after %0a%3c being applied to the body, it must be left to dry in the sun. %0a%3c %0a%3c It must not be supposed, however, that all hot waters are %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 60 Or rather, as Ajasson says, for cutaneous diseases. %0a%3c %0a%3c 61 See B. iii. c. 17. . %0a%3c %0a%3c 62 In conformity with Sillig’s suggestion, we reject “ atque as an in- %0a%3c %0a%3c J 63 Mulcenv %0a%3c %0a%3c te Ji i n spite of what Pliny says, in some cases the use of a mineral bath %0a%3c is recommended for a long period of time together.

THE ADVANTAGES OP %0a%3c %0a%3c A SEA-VOYAGE. %0a%3c %0a%3c Sea-water also is employed in a similar manner for the cure %0a%3c of diseases. It is used, made hot, for the cure of pains in the %0a%3c sinews, for reuniting fractured bones, and for its desiccative %0a%3c action upon the body: for which last purpose, it is also used %0a%3c cold. There are numerous other medicinal resources derived %0a%3c from the sea ; the benefit of a sea-voyage, more particularly, %0a%3c in cases of phthisis, as already 68 mentioned, and where patients %0a%3c are suffering from hsemoptosis, as lately experienced, in our %0a%3c own memory, by Annaeus Gallio, 69 at the close of his consul¬ %0a%3c ship : 70 for it is not for the purpose of visiting the country, that %0a%3c people so often travel to Egypt, but in order to secure the %0a%3c beneficial results arising from a long sea-voyage. Indeed, the %0a%3c very sea-sickness that is caused by the rocking of the vessel %0a%3c to and fro, is good for many affections of the head, eyes, and %0a%3c chest, all those cases, in fact, in which the patient is recom¬ %0a%3c mended to drink an infusion of hellebore. Medical men con¬ %0a%3c sider sea-water, employed by itself, highly efficacious for the %0a%3c dispersion of tumours, and, boiled with barley-meal, for the %0a%3c successful treatment of imposthumes of the parotid glands : it %0a%3c is used also as an ingredient in plasters, white plasters more %0a%3c particularly, and for emollient 71 poultices. Sea-water is very %0a%3c good, too, employed as a shower-bath; and it is taken inter¬ %0a%3c nally, though not without 72 injury to the stomach, both as a %0a%3c %0a%3c 67 See B. ii c. 106. %0a%3c %0a%3c 68 In B. xxiv. c. 19, and B. xxviii. c. 14. %0a%3c %0a%3c 63 An elder brother of the philosopher Seneca. • His original name was %0a%3c M.

Some, again, are for %0a%3c boiling it, but in all cases it is recommended to be taken from %0a%3c out at sea, and untainted with the mixture of fresh water, an %0a%3c emetic also being taken before using it. When used in this %0a%3c manner, vinegar or wine is generally mixed with the water. %0a%3c Those who give it unmixed, recommend radishes with oxymel %0a%3c to be eaten upon it, in order to provoke vomiting. Sea-water, %0a%3c made hot, is used also as an injection; and there is nothing in %0a%3c existence preferred to it as a fomentation for swellings of the %0a%3c testes, or for chilblains before they ulcerate. It is similarly %0a%3c employed, also, for the cure of prurigo, itch-scab, and lichens. %0a%3c Lice and other foul vermin of the head, are removed by the %0a%3c application of sea-water, and lividities of the skin are restored %0a%3c to their natural colour; it being a remarkably good plan, in %0a%3c such cases, after applying the sea-water, to foment the parts %0a%3c with hot vinegar. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is generally considered, too, that sea-water is highly %0a%3c efficacious for the stings of venomous insects, those of the pha- %0a%3c langium and scorpion, for example, and as an antidote to the %0a%3c poisonous secretions of the asp, known as the “ ptyas ;”' 5 in all %0a%3c which cases it is employed hot. Fumigations are also made of %0a%3c it, with vinegar, for the cure of head-ache; and, used warm as %0a%3c an injection, it allays griping pains in the bowels and cholera. %0a%3c Things that have been heated in sea-water are longer than %0a%3c ordinary in cooling. A sea-water bath is an excellent cor¬ %0a%3c rective for swelling 76 of the bosoms in females, afiections of %0a%3c the thoracic organs, and emaciation of the body. The steam %0a%3c also of sea-water boiled with vinegar, is used for the removal %0a%3c of hardness of hearing and head-ache.

It is a singular fact in con¬ %0a%3c nexion with this discovery, that if more than one sextarius of %0a%3c salt is put into four sextarii of water, the liquefying proper¬ %0a%3c ties of the water will be overpowered, and the salt will no %0a%3c longer melt. On the other hand, again, a mixture of one sex¬ %0a%3c tarius of salt with four sextarii of water, acts as a good substi¬ %0a%3c tute for the efficacy and properties of the very saltest sea-water. %0a%3c The most reasonable proportion, however, is generally thought %0a%3c to he eight cyathi of salt, diluted in the quantity of water %0a%3c above mentioned; a preparation which has been found to %0a%3c have a warming effect upon the sinews, without in any degree %0a%3c chafing the body. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 35.- HOW THALASSOMELI IS MADE. %0a%3c %0a%3c There is also a composition made to ripen for use, known as %0a%3c “ thalassomeli,” 78 and prepared with equal parts of sea-water, %0a%3c honey, and rain-water.

Fleeces are spread round the ship, and on %0a%3c becoming moistened with the exhalations arising from the sea, %0a%3c the water is wrung from them, and found to be quite fresh. %0a%3c Hollow balls of wax, also, or empty vessels sealed at the mouth, %0a%3c upon being let down into the sea in a net, become filled with %0a%3c water that is fresh and potable. On shore, too, sea-water may %0a%3c be made fresh, by filtering it through argillaceous earth. %0a%3c %0a%3c By swimming in water of any kind, sprains of the limbs in %0a%3c man or beast are reduced 80 with the greatest facility. Persons %0a%3c when travelling, are sometimes apprehensive that the use of %0a%3c water, the quality of which is unknown to them, may prove %0a%3c injurious to their health : as a precaution against this, they %0a%3c should drink the suspected water cold, immediately after leaving %0a%3c the bath. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAT. 38.- SIX REMEDIES DERIVED FRO^I MOSS.

(7.)— the various kinds of salt; the methods op %0a%3c %0a%3c PREPARING IT, AND THE REMEDIES DERIVED FROM IT. TWO %0a%3c %0a%3c HUNDRED AND FOUR OBSERVATIONS THEREUPON. %0a%3c %0a%3c All salt is either native or artificial ; 81 both kinds being %0a%3c formed in various ways, but produced from one of these two %0a%3c causes, the condensation or the desiccation, of a liquid . 84 The %0a%3c Lake of Tarentum is dried up by the heat of the summer sun, %0a%3c and the whole of its waters, which are at no time very deep, %0a%3c not higher than the knee in fact, are changed into one muss %0a%3c of salt. The same, too, with a lake in Sicily, Cocanicus by %0a%3c name, and another in the vicinity of Gela. But in the case of %0a%3c these two last, it is only the sides 86 that are thus dried up ; %0a%3c whereas in Phrygia, in Cappadocia, and at Aspendus, where %0a%3c the same phaenomena are observable, the water is dried up to %0a%3c a much larger extent, to the very middle of the lake, in fact. %0a%3c There is also another marvellous 87 circumstance connected with %0a%3c this last—however much salt is taken out of it in the day, its %0a%3c place is supplied again during the night. Every kind of lake- %0a%3c salt is found in grains, and not in the form of blocks . 88 %0a%3c %0a%3c Sea-water, again, spontaneously produces another kind of %0a%3c salt, from the foam which it leaves on shore at high-water %0a%3c mark, or adhering to rocks; this being, in all cases, condensed %0a%3c by the action of the sun, and that 89 salt being the most pun¬ %0a%3c gent of the two which is found upon the rocks. %0a%3c %0a%3c There are also three different kinds of native salt. In Bac- %0a%3c triana there are two vast lakes ; 90 one of them situate on the side %0a%3c %0a%3c 84 “ Sal fit.” This expression is not correct, there.being no such thing %0a%3c as made salt. It is only collected from a state df suspension or dissolution. %0a%3c Pliny, however, includes under the name “sal” many substances, which %0a%3c in reality are not salt. Ilis “ hainmoniacum,” for instance, if identical %0a%3c with bydrochlorate of ammonia, can with justice be said to be made, being %0a%3c formed artificially from other substances. %0a%3c %0a%3c 85 “ Coacto humore vel siccato.” These two terms in reality imply the %0a%3c same process, by the medium of evaporation ; the former perfect, the latter %0a%3c imperfect. %0a%3c %0a%3c 86 The evaporation not being sufficiently strong to dry up the deeper parts. %0a%3c %0a%3c 87 There is in reality nothing wonderful in this, considering that most %0a%3c lakes are constantly fed with the streams of rivers, which carry mineral salts %0a%3c along with them, and that the work of evaporation is always going on. %0a%3c %0a%3c 88 “ Glaebas.” %0a%3c %0a%3c 89 Because it is necessarily purer than that found upon the sand. %0a%3c %0a%3c 90 The description is not sufficiently clear to enable us to identify these %0a%3c lakes with certainty. Ajasson thinks that one of them may be the Lake %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 39.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c THE VAItlOUS KINDS OE SALT. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 501 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c of Scythia, the other on that of Ariana, both of which throw %0a%3c up vast quantities of salt. 91 So, too, at Citium, in Cyprus ; and, %0a%3c in the vicinity of Memphis, they extract salt from the lake %0a%3c and dry it in the sun. The surface-waters of some rivers, also, %0a%3c condense 92 in the form of salt, the rest of the stream flowing %0a%3c beneath, as though under a crust of ice ; such a3 the running %0a%3c waters near the Caspian Gates 93 for instance, which are known %0a%3c as the “Itivers of Salt.’’ The same is the case, too, in the vici¬ %0a%3c nity of the Mardi and of the people of Armenia. In Bactriana, %0a%3c also, the rivers Oehus 91 and Oxus carry down from the moun¬ %0a%3c tains on their banks, fragments of salt. There are also in %0a%3c Africa some lakes, the waters of which are turbid, that are %0a%3c productive of salt. Some hot springs, too, produce salt—those %0a%3c at Pagasoe for example. Such, then, are the various kinds of %0a%3c salt produced spontaneously by water. %0a%3c %0a%3c There are certain mountains, also, formed of native salt; that %0a%3c of Oromenus, in India, for example, where it is cut out like %0a%3c blocks from a quarry, and is continually reproduced, bringing %0a%3c in a larger revenue to the sovereigns of those countries than %0a%3c that arising from their gold and pearls. In some instances %0a%3c it is dug out of the earth, being formed there, evidently, by %0a%3c the condensation of the moisture, as in Cappadocia for example, %0a%3c where it is cut in sheets, like those of mirror-stone. 95 The %0a%3c blocks of it are very heavy, the name commonly given to them %0a%3c being “ mica.” 95 At Gerrhse, 97 a city of Arabia, the ramparts %0a%3c and houses are constructed of blocks of salt, which are sol¬ %0a%3c dered together by being moistened with water. King Ptole- %0a%3c maeus discovered salt also in the vicinity of Pelusium, when %0a%3c he encamped there ; a circumstance which induced other per¬ %0a%3c sons to seek and discover it in the scorched tracts that lie %0a%3c between Kgypt and Arabia, beneath the sand. In the same %0a%3c %0a%3c of Badakandir in the Khan at of Bokhara ; and the other the lake that lies %0a%3c between Ankhio and Akeba, in the west of the tenitoiy of Balkh, and near %0a%3c the Usbek Tartars. 91 “ S;de exmstuant.” %0a%3c %0a%3c 92 In consequence of the intense heat. . %0a%3c %0a%3c 93 All these regions, Ajasson remarks, are covered with salt. An im¬ %0a%3c mense desert of s°alt extends to the north-east of Irak-Adjemi, and to the %0a%3c north of Kerman, between Tabaristan, western Khoracan, and Kholiistan. %0a%3c %0a%3c n Identified by Ajasson with the Herat and the Djihoun. He thinks %0a%3c that it is of some of the small affluents of this last that Pliny speaks. %0a%3c %0a%3c 94 “ Lapis specularis.” %0a%3c %0a%3c 96 \ “ crumb ” properly, in the Latin language, %0a%3c %0a%3c 91 See B. vi. c. 32. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 50: %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c pliny’s natubal histoby. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XXXI. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c manner, too, it has been found in the thirsting deserts of %0a%3c Africa, as far as the oracle of Hamrnon, 98 a locality in which %0a%3c the salt increases at night with the increase of the moon. %0a%3c %0a%3c The districts of Cyrenaica are ennobled, too, by the production %0a%3c of hammoniacum," a salt so called from the fact of its being %0a%3c found beneath the sands 1 there. It is similar in colour to the %0a%3c alum known as “ schiston,” 2 and consists of long pieces, by no %0a%3c means transparent, and of an unpleasant flavour, but highly %0a%3c useful in medicine; that being held in the highest esteem, %0a%3c which is the clearest and divides into straight 3 flakes. There %0a%3c is one remarkable fact mentioned in connexion with it: so long %0a%3c as it lies underground in its bed 4 it is extremely light, but the %0a%3c moment it is exposed to the light, it is hardly credible to what %0a%3c an extent its weight is increased. The reason for this is evi¬ %0a%3c dent : 5 the humid vapours of the excavations bear the masses %0a%3c upwards, as water does, and so aid the workmen. It is adulte¬ %0a%3c rated with the Sicilian salt which we have mentioned as being %0a%3c found in Lake Cocanicus, as also with that of Cyprus, which %0a%3c is marvellously like it. At Egelasta, 6 in Nearer Spain, there %0a%3c is a salt, hewn from the bed in almost transparent blocks, and %0a%3c to which for this long time past most medical men, it is said, %0a%3c have given the preference over all other salt. Every spot in %0a%3c %0a%3c 38 More commonly known as Jupiter Hamrnon. %0a%3c %0a%3c 99 See B. xii. c. 49, and B. xxiv. c. 28, for an account of gum resin am¬ %0a%3c moniac, a produce of the same locality. The substance here spoken of is %0a%3c considered by Beckmann to be nothing but common salt in an impure state. %0a%3c See his Hist. Inv. Yol. II. pp. 398-9, where this passage is discussed at %0a%3c considerable length. Ajasson, on the other hand, considers it to be Hydro¬ %0a%3c chlorate of ammonia, the Sal ammoniac of commerce. According to some %0a%3c accounts, it was originally made in the vicinity of the Temple of Jupiter %0a%3c Hamrnon, by burning camels’ dung. %0a%3c %0a%3c 1 Called afifioQ, in Greek. 2 See B. xxxv. c. 52. %0a%3c %0a%3c 3 Sal ammoniac crystallizes in octahedrons. %0a%3c %0a%3c 4 “ Intra specus suos.” On this passage, Beckmann says, “ From what %0a%3c is said by Pliny it may with certainty be concluded that this salt was dug %0a%3c %0a%3c up from pits or mines in Africa.-Many kinds of rock-salt, taken from %0a%3c %0a%3c the mines of Wieliczka, experience the same change in the air ; so that %0a%3c blocks which a labourer can easily carry in the mine, can scarcely be lifted %0a%3c by him after being for some time exposed to the air. The cause here is %0a%3c undoubtedly the same as that which makes many kinds of artificial salt to %0a%3c become moist and to acquire more weight.”—Yol.

In the neighbourhood of Utica, in Africa, they build %0a%3c up masses of salt, like hills in appearance; and when these have %0a%3c been hardened by the action of the sun and moon, no moisture %0a%3c will ever melt them, and iron can hardly divide them. In %0a%3c Crete, however, salt is made without the aid of fresh water, %0a%3c and merely by introducing sea-water into the salt-pans. On %0a%3c the shores of Egypt, salt is formed by the overflow of the sea %0a%3c upon the land, already prepared for its reception, in my opinion, %0a%3c by the emanations of the river Nilus. It is made here, also, %0a%3c from the water 8 of certain wells, discharged into salt-pans. At %0a%3c Babylon, the result of the first condensation is a bituminous 9 %0a%3c liquid, like oil, which is used for burning in lamps ; when this %0a%3c is skimmed off, the salt is found beneath. In Cappadocia, %0a%3c also, both well and spring-water are introduced into the salt¬ %0a%3c pans. In Chaonia there is a spring, from the water of which, %0a%3c when boiled 10 and left to cool, there is an inert salt obtained, %0a%3c not so white as ordinary salt. In the Gallic provinces and %0a%3c in Germany, it is the practice to pour salt-water upon burning %0a%3c wood. 11 %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 40.-MTTKIA. %0a%3c %0a%3c In one part of Spain, they draw a brine for this purpose %0a%3c from deep-sunk pits, to which they give the name of “muria;” %0a%3c being of opinion, also, that it makes a considerable difference %0a%3c upon what kind of wood it is poured. That of the quercus %0a%3c they look upon as the best, as the ashes of it, unmixed, have %0a%3c %0a%3c 7 Speaking generally, this is true; but soils which contain it in small %0a%3c quantities are fruitful. %0a%3c %0a%3c 8 A similar method is still employed, Ajasson says, at the salt-mines near %0a%3c %0a%3c Innspruck in the Tyrol. . ... %0a%3c %0a%3c 9 Native bitumen ; always to be found in greater or less quantities, in %0a%3c saliferous earths. %0a%3c %0a%3c 10 The process of artificial evaporation. %0a%3c %0a%3c 11 This would produce an impure alkaline salt.

All salt %0a%3c that is thus prepared with burning wood is black. I find it %0a%3c stated by Theophrastus, that the Umbri 13 are in the habit of %0a%3c boiling ashes of reeds and bulrushes in water, till there remains %0a%3c but little moisture unconsumed. The brine, too, of salted %0a%3c provisions is sometimes boiled over again, and, as soon as all %0a%3c the moisture has evaporated, the salt resumes its original form. %0a%3c That prepared from the pickle of the msena 14 has the finest %0a%3c flavour. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAF. 41. -THE VARIOUS PROPERTIES OP SALT: ONE HUNDRED %0a%3c %0a%3c AND TWENTY HISTORICAL REMARKS RELATIVE THERETO. %0a%3c %0a%3c Of the various kinds of sea-salt, the most esteemed is that of %0a%3c Salamis, in Cyprus; and of the lake-salts, that of Tarentum, %0a%3c and the salt known as Tattsean salt, which comes from Phrygia: %0a%3c these last two are also good for the eyes. That of Cappadocia, %0a%3c which is imported in small cubes, 15 imparts a fine colour, it is %0a%3c said, to the skin; but, for effacing wrinkles, that which we %0a%3c have 16 already spoken of as the salt of Citium is the best: %0a%3c hence it is that, in combination with gith, 17 it is used by fe¬ %0a%3c males as a liniment for the abdomen after childbirth. The %0a%3c drier the salt, the stronger it is in taste; but the most agree¬ %0a%3c able of all, and the whitest known, is that of Tarentum. In %0a%3c addition to these particulars, we would remark also, that the %0a%3c whiter salt is, the more friable it is. Rain-water deadens %0a%3c every kind of salt, but dew-water makes it more delicate in %0a%3c flavour. North-easterly winds render the formation of salt %0a%3c more abundant, but, while south winds prevail, it never in¬ %0a%3c creases. It is only while north-easterly winds prevail, that %0a%3c flower of salt 15 is formed. Neither the salt of Tragasa, nor %0a%3c %0a%3c 12 “ The water, evaporating, would leave the salt behind, but mixed with %0a%3c charcoal, ashes, earth, and alkaline salts; consequently it must have been %0a%3c moist, or at any rate nauseous, if not refined by a new solution.”—Beck¬ %0a%3c mann’s Hist.

In Cappa¬ %0a%3c docia there is a saffron-coloured fossil salt, transparent and %0a%3c remarkably odoriferous. For medicinal purposes, the ancients %0a%3c esteemed the salt of Tarentum in particular, and next to that %0a%3c all the marine salts, those collected from sea-foam more espe¬ %0a%3c cially. For maladies of the eyes in cattle and beasts of burden, %0a%3c the salt of Tragasa and that of Baetica are employed. For %0a%3c made dishes 22 and ordinary food, the more easily a salt liquefies %0a%3c and the moister it is, the more highly it is esteemed; there %0a%3c being less bitterness in salt of this description, that of Attica %0a%3c and of Euboea, for example. For keeping meat, a pungent, %0a%3c dry, salt, like that of Megara, is best. A conserve of salt is also %0a%3c made, with the addition of various odoriferous substances, %0a%3c which answers all the purpose of a choice sauce, 23 sharpening %0a%3c the appetite, and imparting a relish to all kinds of food : in¬ %0a%3c deed, among the innumerable condiments which we use, the %0a%3c flavour of salt is always distinctly perceptible; and when %0a%3c we take garum 21 with our food, it is its salt flavour that is %0a%3c considered so exquisite. And not only this, but sheep even, %0a%3c cattle, and beasts of burden, are induced to graze all the bet¬ %0a%3c ter 25 by giving them salt; it having the effect, also, of con¬ %0a%3c siderably augmenting the milk, and imparting a superior flavour %0a%3c to the cheese. %0a%3c %0a%3c We may conclude, then, by Hercules ! that the higher en¬ %0a%3c joyments of life could not exist without the use of salt: indeed, %0a%3c so highly necessary is this substance to mankind, that the %0a%3c pleasures of the mind, even, can be expressed by no better %0a%3c term than the word “ salt,” 26 such being the name given to %0a%3c %0a%3c 19 See B. iv. c. 17. %0a%3c %0a%3c 20 St. Augustin mentions this marvellous kind of salt.

SALSUGO : %0a%3c %0a%3c TAVO REMEDIES. %0a%3c %0a%3c That which mainly distinguishes the produce of salt-works, %0a%3c in respect of its purity, is a sort of efflorescence, 32 which forms %0a%3c the lightest and whitest part of salt. The name “flower of %0a%3c salt ” 33 is given, also, to a substance of an entirely different %0a%3c character, more humid by nature, and of a red or saffron co¬ %0a%3c lour ; a kind of “rust of salt,” as it were, with an unpleasant %0a%3c smell like that of garum, and differing therein not only from %0a%3c froth of salt, 31 but from salt itself. This substance is found %0a%3c %0a%3c 27 Literally, “ salt money”—“ argentum ” being understood. The term %0a%3c was originally applied to the pay of the generals and military tribunes. %0a%3c Hence our word “ salary.” %0a%3c %0a%3c 28 Beginning at the Colline Gate. 29 “ In congiario.” %0a%3c %0a%3c 30 Most probably “ He cannot earn salt to his bread,” or something %0a%3c similar, like our saying, “ He cannot earn salt to his porridge.” The two %0a%3c Greek proverbs given by Dalechamps do not appear to the purpose. %0a%3c %0a%3c 31 “ Mola salsa.” 32 “Favillam.” %0a%3c %0a%3c 33 “ Schroder thinks that in what Pliny says of Flos Salis, he can find %0a%3c the martial sal ammoniac flowers of our chemists, [the double chloride of %0a%3c ammonium and iron], or the so-called flares sales ammoniaci martiales — %0a%3c It is certain that what Dioscorides and Pliny call flos salis, has never yet %0a%3c been defined.

Indeed, there is no liquid hardly, %0a%3c with the exception of the unguents, that has sold at higher %0a%3c prices of late; so much so, that the nations which produce it %0a%3c have become quite ennobled thereby. There are fisheries, %0a%3c too, of the scomber on the coasts of Mauretania, and at Carteia %0a%3c in Baetica, near the Straits 43 which lie at the entrance to the %0a%3c Ocean ; this being the only use that is made of the fish. For %0a%3c the production of garum, Clazomense is also famed, Pompeii, %0a%3c too, and Leptis ; while for their muria, Antipolis, 41 Thurii, and %0a%3c of late, Dalmatia, 45 enjoy a high reputation. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 44.- ALEX : EIGHT REMEDIES. %0a%3c %0a%3c Alex, which is the refuse of garum, properly consists of the %0a%3c dregs of it, when imperfectly strained : but of late they have %0a%3c begun to prepare it separately, from a small fish that is other¬ %0a%3c wise good for nothing, the apua 46 of the Latins, or aphua of %0a%3c the Greeks, so called from the fact of its being engendered %0a%3c from rain. 47 The people of Forum Julii 48 make their garum %0a%3c from a fish to which they give the name of “lupus.” 49 In %0a%3c process of time, alex has become quite an object of luxury, and %0a%3c the various kinds that are now made are infinite in number. %0a%3c The same, too, -with garum, which is now prepared in imitation %0a%3c of the colour of old honied wine, and so pleasantly flavoured %0a%3c as to admit of being taken as a drink.

In the same -way, too, alex has %0a%3c come to be manufactured from oysters, sea-urchins, sea-nettles, %0a%3c cammari, 52 and the liver of the surmullet; and a thousand %0a%3c different methods have been devised of late for ensuring the %0a%3c putrefaction of salt in such a way as to secure the flavours %0a%3c most relished by the palate. %0a%3c %0a%3c Thus much, by the way, with reference to the tastes of the %0a%3c present day; though at the same time, it must be remembered, %0a%3c these substances are by no means without their uses in medi¬ %0a%3c cine. Alex, for instance, is curative of scab in sheep, incisions %0a%3c being made in the skin, and the liquor poured therein. It is %0a%3c useful, also, for the cure of wounds inflicted by dogs or by %0a%3c the sea-dragon, the application being made with lint. Recent %0a%3c burns, too, are healed by the agency of garum, due care being %0a%3c taken to apply it without mentioning it by name. It is useful, %0a%3c too, for bites inflicted by dogs, and for that of the crocodile in %0a%3c particular ; as also for the treatment of serpiginous or sordid %0a%3c ulcers. For ulcerations, and painful affections of the mouth %0a%3c and ears, it is a marvellously useful remedy. %0a%3c %0a%3c Muria, also, as well as the salsugo which we have mentioned, 53 %0a%3c has certain astringent, mordent, and discussive properties, and is %0a%3c highly useful for the cure of dysentery, even when ulceration %0a%3c has attacked the intestines. Injections are also made of it %0a%3c for sciatica, and for coeliac fluxes of an inveterate nature. In %0a%3c spots which lie at a distance in the interior, it is used as a fo¬ %0a%3c mentation, by way of substitute for sea-water. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 45. (9.)— -THE NATURE OF SALT. %0a%3c %0a%3c Salt, regarded by itself, is naturally igneous, and yet it %0a%3c manifests an antipathy to fire, and flies 51 from it. It consumes %0a%3c everything, and yet upon living bodies it has an astringent, %0a%3c desiccative, and binding effect, while the dead it preserves %0a%3c from putrefaction, 55 and makes them last for ages even. In %0a%3c respect, however, of its medicinal properties, it is of a mordent, %0a%3c burning, detergent, attenuating, and resolvent nature; it is, how¬ %0a%3c ever, injurious to the stomach, except that it acts as a stimulant %0a%3c without scales being forbidden to the Jews by the Levitical Law. See Lev. %0a%3c c. xi. ver. 10. It is, most probably, Pliny’s own mistake. %0a%3c %0a%3c 53 See B. xxvii. c. 2.

Taken %0a%3c internally with vinegar, it is good for injuries caused by the %0a%3c scolopendra; and, applied topically, with an equal proportion %0a%3c of linseed, in oil or vinegar, for stings inflicted by scorpions. For %0a%3c stings of hornets, wasps, and insects of a similar description, %0a%3c it is applied with vinegar; and, for the cure of hemicrania, %0a%3c ulcers on the head, blisters, pimples, and incipient warts, with %0a%3c veal-suet. It is used also among the remedies for the eyes, %0a%3c and for the removal of fleshy excrescences upon those organs, %0a%3c as also of hangnails 6 * upon the fingers or toes. For webs that %0a%3c form upon the eyes it is peculiarly useful, and hence it is that %0a%3c it is so commonly employed as an ingredient in eye-salves, as %0a%3c well as plasters. For all these last-mentioned purposes, the %0a%3c salt of Tatta or of Caunus is more particularly in request. %0a%3c %0a%3c In cases where there is ecchymosis of the eyes, or a bruise %0a%3c from the effects of a blow, salt is applied, with an equal quan¬ %0a%3c tity of myrrh and honey, or with hyssop in warm water, the %0a%3c eyes being also fomented with salsugo. For this last-mentioned %0a%3c purpose, the Spanish salt is preferred; and when wanted for %0a%3c the treatment of cataract, it is ground upon small whet¬ %0a%3c stones, with milk. For bruises it is particularly useful, %0a%3c wrapped in a linen pledget and renewed from time to time, %0a%3c being first dipped in boiling water. For the cure of running %0a%3c ulcers of the mouth, it is applied with lint; gum-boils are also %0a%3c rubbed with it; and, broken to pieces and powdered fine, it %0a%3c removes granulations on the tongue. The teeth, it is said, %0a%3c will never become carious or corroded, if a person every morn¬ %0a%3c ing puts some salt beneath his tongue, fasting, and leaves it %0a%3c there till it has melted. Salt effects the cure also of leprosy, %0a%3c boils, lichens, and itch-scabs; for all which purposes it is ap¬ %0a%3c plied with raisins—the stones being first removed—beef-suet, %0a%3c origanum, and leaven, or else bread. In such cases it is the %0a%3c salt from Theba'is that is mostly used; the same salt being %0a%3c considered preferable for the treatment of prurigo, and being %0a%3c highly esteemed for affections of the uvula and tonsillary glands, %0a%3c in combination with honey. %0a%3c %0a%3c 65 He uses the word “ pterygia ” here, as applied to the whole of the %0a%3c body—“ totius corporis ”—in its two distinct senses, a hangnail or ex¬ %0a%3c crescence on the fingers, and a web or film on the eyes. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 45.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c THE NATURE OF SALT. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 511 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Every kind of salt is useful for the cure of quiuzy ; but, in %0a%3c addition to this, it is necessary to make external applications %0a%3c simultaneously with oil, vinegar, and tar. Mixed with %0a%3c wine, it is a gentle aperient to the bowels, and, taken in a %0a%3c similar manner, it acts as an expellent of all kinds of intestinal %0a%3c worms. Placed beneath the tongue, it enables convalescents %0a%3c to support the heat 67 of the bath. Burnt more than once upon %0a%3c a plate at a white heat, and then enclosed in a bag, it alleviates %0a%3c pains in the sinews, about the shoulders and kidneys more %0a%3c particularly. Taken internally, and similarly burnt at a white %0a%3c heat and applied in bags, it is curative of colic, griping pains %0a%3c in the bowels, and sciatica. Beaten up in wine and honey, %0a%3c with meal, it is a remedy for gout; a malady for the especial %0a%3c behoof of which the observation should be borne in mind, %0a%3c that there is nothing better for all parts of the body than sun %0a%3c and salt : 58 hence 59 it is that we see the bodies of fishermen as %0a%3c hard as horn—gout, however, is the principal disease for the %0a%3c benefit of which this maxim should be remembered. %0a%3c %0a%3c Salt is useful for the removal of corns upon the feet, and of %0a%3c chilblains : for the cure of burns also, it is applied with oil, or %0a%3c else chewed. It acts as a check also upon blisters, and, in cases %0a%3c of erysipelas and serpiginous ulcers, it is applied topically with %0a%3c vinegar or with hyssop. Por the cure of carcinoma it is %0a%3c employed in combination with Taminian 60 grapes; and for %0a%3c phagedaenic ulcers it is used parched with barley-meal, a %0a%3c linen pledget steeped in wine being laid upon it. In cases of %0a%3c jaundice, it is employed as a friction before the fire, with oil %0a%3c aud vinegar, till the patient is made to perspire, for the purpose %0a%3c of preventing the itching sensations attendant upon that dis¬ %0a%3c ease. When persons are exhausted with fatigue, it is usual to %0a%3c rub them with salt and oil. Many have treated dropsy with %0a%3c salt, have used external applications of salt and oil for the %0a%3c burning heats of fever, and have cured chronic coughs by laying %0a%3c salt upon the patient’s tongue. Salt has been used, also, as %0a%3c an injection for sciatica, and has been applied to ulcers of a %0a%3c fungous or putrid nature. %0a%3c %0a%3c To bites inflicted by the crocodile, salt is applied, the sores %0a%3c %0a%3c 67 In c. 23, he has said much the same of cold water. %0a%3c %0a%3c 58 “ Sale et sole.” %0a%3c %0a%3c 59 This passage would come more naturally after the succeeding one. %0a%3c %0a%3c 60 See fi. xxiii. c. 13. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 512 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c pliny’s natural history. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Hook XXXI. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Leing tightly bandaged with linen cloths, first dipped 61 in %0a%3c vinegar.

In cases of tooth¬ %0a%3c ache, it is used as a collutory with vinegar, and is very useful, %0a%3c applied externally, with resin. For all these purposes, however, %0a%3c froth of salt 62 is found to be more agreeable and still more %0a%3c efficacious. Still, however, every kind of salt is good as an %0a%3c ingredient in acopa, 63 when warming properties are required: %0a%3c the same, too, in the case of detersive applications, when re¬ %0a%3c quired for plumping out and giving a smooth surface to the %0a%3c skin. Employed topically, salt is curative of itch-scab in sheep %0a%3c and cattle, for which disease it is given them to lick.

(10.)- THE VARIOUS KINDS OF NITRUM, THE METHODS %0a%3c %0a%3c OF PREPARING IT, AND THE REMEDIES DERIVED FROM IT; TWO %0a%3c %0a%3c HUNDRED AND TWENTY-ONE OBSERVATIONS THEREON. %0a%3c %0a%3c And here we must no longer defer giving an account of %0a%3c nitrum ; 64 which in its properties does not greatly differ from %0a%3c salt, and deserves all the more to be attentively considered, %0a%3c from the evident fact that the medical men who have written %0a%3c upon it were ignorant of its nature; of all which authors %0a%3c Theophrastus is the one that has given the greatest attention to %0a%3c the point. It is found in small quantities in Media, in certain %0a%3c valleys there that are white with heat and Thought; the name %0a%3c given to it being “ halmyrax.” 65 In Thracia, too, near Philippi, %0a%3c %0a%3c 61 “ Ita ut batuerent.ur ante.” From the corresponding passage in %0a%3c Dioscorides, where the expression Bmrr6fi.rvoi tu; 6 £og is used, it would %0a%3c appear that the proper word here is “ baptizarenturor possibly, a lost %0a%3c Graeco-Latin word, “ bapterentur.” Littrd suggests “ hebetarentur,” “the %0a%3c part being first numbed ” by the aid of a bandage. %0a%3c %0a%3c 63 “ Spuma salis.” Collected from the foam on the sea-shore. %0a%3c %0a%3c 63 See Note 36, above, p. 507. . %0a%3c %0a%3c 64 Beckmann, who devotes several pages to a consideration of the “ ni- %0a%3c %0a%3c tiuxm ” of the ancients, considers it not to be our “ nitre.” or “ saltpetre,” %0a%3c but a general name for impure alkaline salts. See his Hist. Inv. Vol. II. %0a%3c pp. 490—503, Bohn's Ed. Ajasson, without hesitation, pronounces it to %0a%3c be nitrate of potash, neither more or less than our saltpetre, and quotes a %0a%3c statement from Andreossy, that it is still to be found in great quantities %0a%3c at Mount Ptou-Ampihosem, near the city of Pihosem, called Nitria by %0a%3c St. Jerome. * “Salt bursting from the earth.” %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 46.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c VARIOUS KINDS OF NITRUM. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 513 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c it is found, but in smaller quantities, and deteriorated with %0a%3c earthy substances, being known there as “ agrion.” 66 As to %0a%3c that prepared from the burnt wood of the quercus, 67 it never %0a%3c was made to any very great extent, and the manufacture of it %0a%3c has been long since totally abandoned. Nitrous 68 waters are also %0a%3c found in numerous places, but not sufficiently impregnated to %0a%3c admit of condensation. 69 %0a%3c %0a%3c The best and most abundant supply is found at Litae, in %0a%3c Macedonia, where it is known as “ Chalastricum :” 70 it is white %0a%3c and pure, and closely resembles salt. In the middle of a cer¬ %0a%3c tain nitrous lake there, a spring of fresh water issues forth. In %0a%3c this lake the nitrum 71 forms for nine days, about the rising of %0a%3c the Dog-star, and then ceases for the same period, after which %0a%3c it again floats upon the surface, and then again ceases: facts %0a%3c which abundantly prove that it is the peculiar nature of the soil %0a%3c which generates the nitrum, it being very evident that, when %0a%3c the formation is there interrupted, neither the heat of the sun %0a%3c nor the fall of rain is productive of the slightest effect. It %0a%3c is also a truly marvellous fact, that though the spring of fresh %0a%3c water is always uninterruptedly flowing, the waters of the lake %0a%3c never increase or overflow. If it happens to rain on the days %0a%3c during which the nitrum is forming, the result is, that it is %0a%3c rendered additionally salt thereby: the prevalence of north¬ %0a%3c east winds, too, still more deteriorates its quality, as they have %0a%3c a tendency to stir up the mud at the bottom. Such is the %0a%3c formation of native nitrum. %0a%3c %0a%3c In Egypt, again, it is made artificially, and in much greater %0a%3c abundance, but of inferior quality, being tawny and full of %0a%3c %0a%3c « “ Wild.” . , %0a%3c %0a%3c 67 See c. 40 of this Book.

It is prepared in pretty nearly the same manner 73 as %0a%3c salt, except that in the salt-pans it is sea-water that is intro¬ %0a%3c duced, whereas in the nitre-beds it is the water of the river %0a%3c Hilus; a water which, upon the subsidence of the river, is %0a%3c impregnated with nitrum for forty days together, and not, as in %0a%3c Macedonia, at intermittent periods only. On occasions when %0a%3c there has been a fall of rain, a smaller proportion of river- %0a%3c water is employed. As soon, too, as any quantity of nitrum %0a%3c has formed, it is immediately removed, in order that it may not %0a%3c melt in the beds. This substance, also, contains a certain %0a%3c proportion of oil, 73 which is very useful for the cure of scab in %0a%3c animals. Piled up in large heaps, it keeps for a very con¬ %0a%3c siderable time. It is a marvellous fact, that, in Lake Ascanius 74 %0a%3c and in certain springs in the vicinity of Chalcis, the water is %0a%3c fresh and potable on the surface, and nitrous below. The %0a%3c lightest part of nitrum is always considered the best, and hence %0a%3c it is that the froth of it is so much preferred. Still, however, %0a%3c when in an impure state, it is very useful for some purposes, %0a%3c colouring purple 75 cloth, for instance, and, indeed, all kinds of %0a%3c dyeing. It is employed, also, very extensively in the manu¬ %0a%3c facture of glass, as we shall more fully mention on the appro¬ %0a%3c priate occasion. 76 %0a%3c %0a%3c The only nitre-works in Egypt were formerly those in the %0a%3c vicinity of Haucratis and Memphis; those near Memphis being %0a%3c inferior to the others, the piles of nitrum there prepared %0a%3c being as hard as stone, and many of the heaps having %0a%3c become changed into rocks. When in this state, vessels are %0a%3c made of it, and very frequently they melt it with sulphur 77 on %0a%3c %0a%3c 72 Ajasson remarks, that from this we may conclude that the fabrication %0a%3c of nitrate of potash, or saltpetre, was in its infancy. It is by no means %0a%3c improbable that the artificial nitrum, here mentioned by Pliny, really was %0a%3c artificial saltpetre, more or less impure ; the native nitrum, on the other %0a%3c hand, being, as Beckmann suggests, a general term for impure alkaline %0a%3c mineral salts, in common with native saltpetre. Pliny’s account, however, %0a%3c is confused in the highest degree, and in some passages far from intel¬ %0a%3c ligible. %0a%3c %0a%3c 73 Of a bituminous nature, probably. See c. 42 of this Book. %0a%3c %0a%3c 74 See B. v. c. 40. An alkaline water, Beckmann thinks. See Yol. II. %0a%3c pp. 96-7.

This certainly goes far towards proving that %0a%3c under the name “ nitrum,” alkaline salts were included. %0a%3c %0a%3c 77 “ Faciunt ex his vasa, necnon frequenter liquatum cum sulphure, co- %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 46.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c VARIOUS KINDS OR NITBTJM. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 515 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c a charcoal fire.’ 8 When substances 79 are wanted to keep, they %0a%3c employ this last kind of nitrum. In Egypt there are also nitre- %0a%3c beds, the produce of which is red, owing to the colour of the %0a%3c earth in the same locality. Froth of nitrum, 80 a substance %0a%3c held in very high esteem, could only be made, according to the %0a%3c ancients, when dews had fallen ; the pits being at the moment %0a%3c saturated with nitrum, but not having arrived at the point of %0a%3c yielding it. On the other hand, again, when the pits were in %0a%3c full activity, no froth would form, it was said, even though %0a%3c dews should fall. Others, again, have attributed the formation %0a%3c of this last substance to the fermentation of the heaps of %0a%3c nitrum. In a succeeding age, the medical men, speaking of it %0a%3c under the name of “ aphronitrum,” 81 have stated that it was %0a%3c collected in Asia, where it was to be found oozing from the %0a%3c soft sides of certain mines—the name given to which was %0a%3c “ colyces” 82 —and that it was then dried in the sun. The very %0a%3c best is thought to be that which comes from Lydia; the test of %0a%3c its genuineness being its extreme lightness, its friability, and %0a%3c its colour, which should be almost a full purple. This last is %0a%3c imported in tablets, while that of Egypt comes enclosed in %0a%3c %0a%3c quentes in carbonibus.” This passage Beckmann pronounces to be one of %0a%3c the darkest parts in the history of nitrum. See Vol. II. p. 502. He is of %0a%3c opinion that not improbably the result here obtained would be, liver of %0a%3c sulphur, which when it cools is hard, but soon becomes moist when ex¬ %0a%3c posed to the air. Dalechamps, it would appear, explains the whole of this %0a%3c passage as applicable to glazing; but in such case, as Beckmann observes, %0a%3c the nitrum could serve only as a flux. Michaelis suggests that the vessels %0a%3c here mentioned, were cut, not for real use, but merely for ornament, in the %0a%3c same manner as they are still made, occasionally, from rock-salt. %0a%3c %0a%3c 18 The mention of nitrum, sulphur, and charcoal, probably the three %0a%3c ingredients of gunpowder, in such close proximity, is somewhat curious. %0a%3c %0a%3c 79 “ Quae ” seems a preferable reading to “ quos.” %0a%3c %0a%3c 80 “ Spuma nitri.” An accidental property, Beckmann says, of the %0a%3c same salt that has been previously called “ Chalastrieum,” “ Ilalmyrax,” %0a%3c “Aphronitrum,” and “ Agrion.” In his opinion, “ the ancients were ac¬ %0a%3c quainted with no other than native nitrum, which they called artificial , %0a%3c only when it required a little more trouble and art to obtain it.”— Hist. %0a%3c Inv. Vol. II. p. 502.

The reading, however, is very doubtful. %0a%3c Sillig, from Photius, suggests that it should be “ scolecas.” %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 516 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c punt’s natural histort. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XXXI. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c vessels pitched within, to prevent its melting, 83 the vessels %0a%3c being previously prepared by being thoroughly dried in the %0a%3c sun. 84 %0a%3c %0a%3c To be good, nitrum should be very fine, and extremely %0a%3c spongy and porous. In Egypt, it is sophisticated with lime, %0a%3c an adulteration easily detected 85 by tasting it; for when pure, %0a%3c it liquefies immediately, while that which has been adulte¬ %0a%3c rated, remains undissolved sufficiently long to leave a pungent %0a%3c taste 86 in the mouth. It is burnt in a close earthen vessel, as %0a%3c otherwise it would decrepitate : 87 except in this last case, how¬ %0a%3c ever, the action of fire does not cause it to decrepitate. This %0a%3c substance neither produces-nor nourishes anything; while, in %0a%3c the salt-pans, on the other hand, we see plants growing, and %0a%3c the sea, we know, produces immense numbers of animated %0a%3c beings, though, as to plants, sea-weed only. It is evident, too, %0a%3c that the acridity 88 of nitrum must be much greater than that %0a%3c of salt, not only from the fact last mentioned, but from the %0a%3c circumstance also, that at the nitre-beds the shoes wear out %0a%3c with the greatest rapidity; localities which are otherwise very %0a%3c healthy, and remarkably beneficial for the eye-sight. At the %0a%3c nitre-works ophthalmia is a thing unknown : persons, too, %0a%3c that come there with ulcers upon them experience a rapid %0a%3c cure; though ulcerations formed upon the spot are but slow %0a%3c in healing. Used as a friction with oil, nitrum is a sudorific, %0a%3c and acts emolliently upon the body. That of Chalastra is %0a%3c used as a substitute for salt, in making bread, 89 and the Egyp- %0a%3c %0a%3c 83 One proof, Beckmann thinks, that Soda is meant. See Yol.

Vol. II. p. 491. %0a%3c %0a%3c 85 Beckmann thinks that this mode of adulteration, with lime, is an %0a%3c %0a%3c additional proof that the “ nitrum ” of our author was only soda. See %0a%3c Yol.

Vol. II. p. 492. %0a%3c %0a%3c 88 This would hardly apply to soda. %0a%3c %0a%3c 89 Probably to promote its rising, as Beckmann observes, Vol. II. p. %0a%3c 496; a circumstance which goes a great way towards proving that “ Soda” %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 4G.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c VAEIOTTS KINDS OF NITEUil. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 517 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c tian nitrum is eaten 90 with radishes, 91 it having the effect of %0a%3c making them more tender; though as to other edibles it turns %0a%3c them white and spoils them. To vegetables it imparts an ad¬ %0a%3c ditional greenness. 92 %0a%3c %0a%3c Viewed medicinally, nitrum is calorific, attenuant, mordent, %0a%3c astringent, desiccative, and ulcerating: it is good, too, in all %0a%3c cases where certain humours require to be drawn out or dis¬ %0a%3c persed, or where gentle mordents or attenuants are required, %0a%3c as in the case of pustules and pimples, for example. Some %0a%3c persons ignite it for this purpose, and, after quenching it in %0a%3c astringent wine, bruise and use it, without oil, at the bath. %0a%3c Applied with dried iris powdered, and green olive oil, it checks %0a%3c immoderate perspiration. Applied topically with a fig, or boiled %0a%3c down to one half in raisin wine, it removes marks upon the %0a%3c eyes and granulations of the eyelids. It is used, also, for the %0a%3c removal of argema, boiled in a pomegranate rind with raisin %0a%3c wine. Used as an ointment, in combination with honey, it %0a%3c improves the eye-sight. It is very useful, also, for tooth-ache, %0a%3c taken as a collutory with wine and pepper, or boiled with a %0a%3c leek. Burnt, and employed as a dentifrice, it restores teeth 93 %0a%3c to their original colour that have turned black ; and an appli¬ %0a%3c cation of it, with Samian earth and oil, kills nits and other %0a%3c vermin of the head. Dissolved in wine, it is used as an in¬ %0a%3c jection for suppurations of the ears, and, applied with vinegar, %0a%3c it consumes filth that has accumulated there. Introduced %0a%3c dry into the ears, it disperses singings and tinglings in those %0a%3c organs. %0a%3c %0a%3c Applied topically, in the sun, with an equal quantity of %0a%3c Cimolian 94 chalk dissolved in vinegar, it removes white mor- %0a%3c phew ; and a mixture of it with resin, or with white raisins— %0a%3c the stones being beaten up as well—is an excellent cure for %0a%3c %0a%3c was included, at least, under the name of “ nitrum.’’ Carbonate of soda is %0a%3c extensively used for this purpose at the present day. %0a%3c %0a%3c 90 And to correct the acridity of the radishes, possibly.

For the cure of bites inflicted by dogs, it %0a%3c is used with resin, the application being made at first with vine¬ %0a%3c gar. With lime and vinegar, it is used as a liniment for stings %0a%3c inflicted by serpents, as, also, for ulcerations, whether phage- %0a%3c daenic, putrid, or serpiginous; in cases, too, of dropsy, it is %0a%3c employed both internally and externally, beaten up with figs. %0a%3c Taken internally as a decoction, in doses of one drachma, with %0a%3c rue, dill, or cummin, it effectually removes griping pains in %0a%3c the bowels. An external application of it, with oil and vine¬ %0a%3c gar, is highly refreshing to persons exhausted with fatigue; %0a%3c and it is equally beneficial for shudderings and cold shiverings, %0a%3c the feet and hands of the patient being well rubbed with it, %0a%3c mixed with oil. It allays the itching sensations attendant %0a%3c upon jaundice, more particularly when it is administered to %0a%3c the patient while perspiring, with vinegar. Taken internally %0a%3c in oxycrate, it is an antidote to the poison of fungi; and, taken %0a%3c with water, it acts beneficially, as an emetic, in cases where the %0a%3c buprestis has been swallowed. %0a%3c %0a%3c To persons who have taken bull’s blood, 95 nitrum is admi¬ %0a%3c nistered, in combination with laser. 96 Mixed with honey and %0a%3c cow’s milk, it is curative of ulcers upon the face. For the cure %0a%3c of burns, it is applied pounded, being first parched till it turns %0a%3c black. For pains in the bowels and kidneys, and for rigidities %0a%3c of the limbs and pains in the sinews, it is used in the form of %0a%3c an injection. For the cure of paralysis of the tongue, it is %0a%3c applied to that organ with bread, and to asthmatic patients it is %0a%3c administered in a ptisan.

(11.) -SPONGES, AND THE REMEDIES DERIVED FROM %0a%3c %0a%3c THEM : NINETY-TWO OBSERVATIONS THEREON. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c We have already, 1 when speaking of the marine productions, %0a%3c described the various kinds of sponge. Some authorities make %0a%3c the following distinctions : they regard as males 2 those sponges %0a%3c which are pierced with more diminutive holes, are more com¬ %0a%3c pact in form and more ready to imbibe, and are stained, to %0a%3c satisfy luxurious tastes, in various colours, sometimes purple %0a%3c even : those, on the other hand, which have holes, larger and %0a%3c running into one another, they consider to be females. Among %0a%3c the male sponges, too, there is one kind, harder than the others, %0a%3c the name given to which is “tragi,” 3 and the holes of which %0a%3c are extremely small and numerous. Sponges are made white %0a%3c artificially; the softest being chosen for the purpose, and after %0a%3c they have been steeped the whole summer through with the %0a%3c foam of the sea. They are then exposed to the action of the %0a%3c moon and hoar-frosts, being turned upside down, or, in other %0a%3c words, with that part upwards by which they formerly ad¬ %0a%3c hered to the rocks, the object being that they may become %0a%3c %0a%3c white throughout. , , , , %0a%3c %0a%3c That sponges are animated beings, we have already stated; %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 99 Beckmann considers that this statement throws some light on the %0a%3c obscure passage, commented on in Note 77, p. 514 See Hist Inv. ^ ol. %0a%3c II. p. 503. Bohn’s Ed. In B. is. c. 69. %0a%3c %0a%3c 2 No such distinction, of course, really exists; sponge being in reality %0a%3c a fibrous tissue formed by minute animals. %0a%3c %0a%3c J “ Goats,” literally. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 520 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c pliny’s natural history. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XXXI. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c and not only this, but they have a coat of blood 1 even, adhering %0a%3c to them. Some say that they regulate their movements by %0a%3c the sense of hearing, and that at the slightest noise they con¬ %0a%3c tract themselves, and emit an abundant moisture : when such %0a%3c is the case, it is said, it is impossible to tear them away from %0a%3c the rocks, and consequently they must be cut, an operation %0a%3c during which they emit a sanious secretion. Those sponges, %0a%3c too, are preferred to all others, which are grown on spots with %0a%3c a north-east aspect, the physicians assuring us that these re¬ %0a%3c tain the breath of life the longest of all; a circumstance which %0a%3c renders them additionally useful to the human body, from the %0a%3c union which is thereby effected of their vital principle with %0a%3c our own. 5 It is for this reason, too, that they are preferred as %0a%3c fresh as possible, and in a moist state rather than dry. They %0a%3c are not so useful, however, if applied with hot water, 8 and %0a%3c still less so if they are oiled, or applied to the body when just %0a%3c anointed. The compact sponges, it is thought, have less adhe¬ %0a%3c sive power than the others. %0a%3c %0a%3c The softest kind of sponge are those employed for tents. 7 %0a%3c Applied with honied wine, sponges reduce swellings of the eyes, %0a%3c and are extremely useful for the removal of rheum from those %0a%3c organs, the very finest and softest being of necessity selected %0a%3c for the purpose. Sponges are applied, also, with oxycrate, to %0a%3c defluxions of the eyes, and, with warm vinegar, for head-ache. %0a%3c In addition to these properties, fresh sponges are resolvent, %0a%3c emollient, and soothing; but when old, they lose their %0a%3c healing properties for wounds. They are employed, also, in %0a%3c medicine,for cleansing sores, and for either fomenting or cover¬ %0a%3c ing the parts fomented, till some other application is made. %0a%3c Applied topically, they have a healing effect upon running %0a%3c ulcers, and upon sores on the bodies of aged persons. Fractures, %0a%3c too, and wounds are most effectually fomented with sponge; %0a%3c and when surgical operations are performed, it instantly ab¬ %0a%3c sorbs the blood, so as to allow the incision to be seen. Sponges %0a%3c are applied, also, as a bandage, to inflamed wounds, sometimes %0a%3c %0a%3c 4 See B. ix. c. 69. He probably alludes to the semifluid thin coat of %0a%3c animal jelly which covers the sponge in its recent state, and is susceptible %0a%3c of a slight contraction on being touched. %0a%3c %0a%3c 5 A fanciful notion, certainly. %0a%3c %0a%3c 6 Hot water renders them greasy, so to say; an inconvenience which %0a%3c may be remedied by steeping them in an alkaline solution,^ or in urine. %0a%3c %0a%3c 7 “ Penicilli.” %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 47.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 8P0NGES. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 521 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c dry, and, in some cases, moistened with vinegar, wine, or cold %0a%3c water. Soaked in rain-water, and applied to the incision, %0a%3c they prevent cuts recently inflicted from swelling. They are %0a%3c used as an application for such parts of the body, though appa¬ %0a%3c rently uninjured, as are threatened with occult humours which %0a%3c require to be dispersed; as also for reducing the tumours %0a%3c known to us as “apostemes,” the parts being first fomented with %0a%3c a decoction of honey. Sponges are employed, also, for affections %0a%3c of the joints, steeped in vinegar and salt, or in oxycrate : in %0a%3c cases, however, where the attack is attended with fever, water %0a%3c alone is used with the sponge. Soaked in salt and water, %0a%3c sponges are applied to callosities; and, with vinegar, they are %0a%3c used for stings inflicted by scorpions. %0a%3c %0a%3c In the treatment of wounds, sponges are sometimes used as %0a%3c a substitute for greasy wool, either with wine and oil, or with %0a%3c salt and water; the only difference being, that wool acts emol- %0a%3c liently upon sores, whereas sponge has an astringent action, %0a%3c and absorbs the vitiated humours. To dropsical patients, ban¬ %0a%3c dages of sponge are applied, either dry or steeped in warm %0a%3c water or oxycrate, according as there is a necessity for soothing %0a%3c the skin, or for covering it up and drying it. Sponges are %0a%3c applied, also, in all those diseases where warmth is required, %0a%3c being first soaked in boiling water and then squeezed out %0a%3c between a couple of hoards. Employed in this manner, too, they %0a%3c are very useful for affections of the stomach and for the excessive %0a%3c heats attendant upon fever. Steeped in oxycrate, they are %0a%3c good for diseases of the spleen, and in vinegar for erysipelas ; %0a%3c nothing, in fact, being equally efficacious. Sponge, when thus %0a%3c used, should always be so applied as amply to cover the adja¬ %0a%3c cent parts that are not affected. %0a%3c %0a%3c Employed with vinegar or cold water, sponge arrests haemor¬ %0a%3c rhage ; soaked in warm salt and water, and frequently renewed, %0a%3c it removes the lividity which results from a recent blow. %0a%3c Used with oxycrate, it disperses pains and swellings in the %0a%3c testes. To bites inflicted by dogs, it is a good plan to apply %0a%3c sponge, from time to time, cut fine, and moistened with %0a%3c vinegar, cold water, or honey. Ashes of African 8 sponge, %0a%3c with juice of cut-leek and a mixture of salt and cold water, %0a%3c are good, taken internally, for patients suffering from dis¬ %0a%3c charges of blood: applied topically to the forehead, with oil or %0a%3c » See B. ix. c. 69. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 522 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c plint’s natural history. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XXXI. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c vinegar, they are curative of tertian fevers. The sponge of %0a%3c Africa, more particularly, soaked in oxycrate, disperses tu¬ %0a%3c mours. Ashes of any kind of sponge burnt with pitch, arrest %0a%3c the discharge of blood from wounds ; though some recommend, %0a%3c for this purpose, the sponge with large pores only, burnt with %0a%3c pitch. For affections of the eyes, sponge is burnt in vessels of %0a%3c unbaked earthenware ; the ashes being found highly efficacious %0a%3c for granulations of the eyelids, fleshy excrescences, and all %0a%3c diseases of those parts which require detergents, astringents, %0a%3c or expletives. For all these purposes, however, it is the best %0a%3c plan first to rinse the ashes. "When the body is in a diseased %0a%3c state, sponge acts as a substitute for body-scrapers and linen %0a%3c towels, and it protects the head most efficiently against the %0a%3c action of the sun. %0a%3c %0a%3c Medical men, in their ignorance, comprehend all sponges %0a%3c under two names; African sponge, the substance of which is %0a%3c tougher and firmer ; and Rhodian sponge, which is softer and %0a%3c better adapted for fomentations. At the present day, however, %0a%3c the softest sponges of all are those found about the walls of the %0a%3c city of Antiphellos. 9 Trogus informs us that the softest tent %0a%3c sponges are found out at sea, off the coast of Lycia, upon spots %0a%3c from which the sponge has been previously removed: we %0a%3c learn, too, from Polybius, that these fine sponges, suspended %0a%3c over a patient’s bed, will ensure him additional repose at %0a%3c night. 10 %0a%3c %0a%3c We will now turn to the remedies derived from the marine %0a%3c and aquatic animals. %0a%3c %0a%3c Summary. — Remedies, narratives, and observations, nine %0a%3c hundred and twenty-four. %0a%3c %0a%3c Roman authors quoted. —M.
