csum=Petrified wood paper [[https://www.swst.org/meetings/AM10/pdfs/WS-59%2520Peng%2520Yucheng%2520Paper.pdf|#]] basically 25%25 sodium silicate solution best, wood soaked well then slowly dried without washing.  My version would be a wet paste of (equal weights to begin) wood ash, salt, and purified clay powder would be mixed with some water to form a paste, and pasted on the wood surfaces to fossilize, then putting it in plastic to prevent drying.  Let sit in this state for a week (or more?) then remove plastic and allow to slowly dry.  When fully dry remove the dirt and you should be left with surface fossilized wood.
