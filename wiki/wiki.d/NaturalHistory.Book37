[[#chap1]]%0a%0aThat nothing may be wanting to the work which I have %0aundertaken, it still remains for me to speak of precious stones : %0aa subject in which the majestic might of Nature presents itself %0ato us, contracted within a very limited space, though, in the %0aopinion of many, nowhere displayed in a more admirable form. %0aSo great is the value that men attach to the multiplied varieties %0aof these gems, their numerous colours, their constituent parts, %0aand their singular beauty, that, in the case of some of them, it %0ais looked upon as no less than sacrilege to engrave them, for %0asignets even, the very purpose for which, in reality, they were %0amade. Others, again, are regarded as beyond all price, and could %0anot be valued, at any known amount of human wealth ; so much %0aso that, in the case of many, it is quite sufficient to have some %0asingle gem or other before the eyes, there to behold the supreme %0aand absolute perfection of Nature's work. %0a%0a"We have already 4 stated, to some extent, when speaking on %0athe subject of gold and rings, how the use of precious stones %0afirst originated, and from what beginnings this admiration of %0athem has now increased to such an universal passion. Ac- %0acording to fabulous lore, the first use of them was suggested %0aby the rocks of Caucasus, in consequence of an unhappy inter- %0apretation which was given to the story of the chains of Pro- %0ametheus : for we are told by tradition, that he enclosed a frag- %0ament of this etone in iron, and wore it upon his finger ; 2 such %0abeing the first ring and the first jewel known. %0a%0a!!CHAP. 2.

It so happened, however, that a fish of re- %0amarkable size, one destined for the table of a king, swallowed %0athe jewel, as it would have done a bait ; and then, to com- %0aplete the portentous omen, restored it again to the owner in the %0aroyal kitchen, by the ruling hand of a treacherous 4 fortune. %0a%0aThe stone in this ring, it is generally agreed, was a sardonyx, 5 %0aand they still show one at Home, which, if we believe the %0astory, was this identical stone. It is enclosed in a horn of gold, %0aand was deposited, by the Emperor Augustus, in the Temple %0aof Concord, where it holds pretty nearly the lowest rank among %0aa multitude of other jewels that are preferable to it. %0a%0a!!CHAP. 3. — THE JEWEL OF PYBKHUS. [[#chap3]]%0a%0aNext in note after this ring, is the jewel that belonged to %0as See B. xxxiii. c. 6. %0a%0a* For ultimately, Oroetes, the satrap of Sardes, contrived to allure him %0ainto his power, and had him crucified, B.C. 622. Fuller, in his Worthies, %0ap. 370, tells a very similar story of the loss and recovery of his ring by %0aone Anderson, a merchant of Newcastle-on-Tyne ; and Zuinglius gives a %0asimilar statement with reference to Arnulph, duke of Lorraine, who dropped %0ahis ring into the Moselle, and recovered it from the belly of a fish. %0a%0a6 See Chapter 23. According to Herodotus, Pausanias, Dionysius of %0aHalicarnassus, and Suidas, the stone was an emerald ; and Lessing thinks %0athat there was no figure engraved on it. See Chapter 4 of this Book. %0aWithout vouching for the truth of it, we give the following extract from %0athe London Journal, Vol. xxiii. No. 592. " A vine-dresser of Albano, %0anear Home, is said to have found in a vineyard, the celebrated ring of %0a%0aPolycrates. The stone is of considerable size, and oblong in form. The %0a%0aengraving on it, by Theodore of Samos, the son of Talikles, is of extra- %0aordinary fineness and beauty. It represents a lyre, with three bees flying %0aabout; below, on the right, a dolphin; on the left, the head of a bull. %0aThe name of the engraver is inscribed in Greek characters. The upper %0asurface of the stone is slightly concave, not highly polished, and one %0acorner broken. It is asserted that tbe possessor has been offered 50,000 %0adollars for it." %0a%0aB B 2 %0a%0a%0a%0a383 %0a%0a%0a%0apliny's natural history.

We %0aonly find it recorded by them, that Ismenias the flute-player 8 %0awas in the habit of displaying great numbers of glittering %0astones, a piece of vanity, on his part, which gave occasion to %0athe following story. An emerald, 9 upon which was engraved %0aa figure of Amymone, 10 being offered for sale in the Isle of %0aCyprus at the price of six golden denarii, he gave orders to %0apurchase it. The dealer however, reduced the price, and %0areturned two denarii; upon which, Ismenias remarked — "By %0aHercules ! he has done me but a bad turn in this, for the merit %0aof the stone has been greatly impaired by this reduction in %0aprice." %0a%0aIt seems to have been this Ismenias who introduced the %0auniversal practice among musicians of proclaiming their artis- %0atic merit by this kind of ostentation. Thus Dionysodorus, for %0ainstance, his contemporary and rival, imitated his example, %0ain order that he might not appear to be his inferior in skill ; %0awhereas, in reality, he only held the third rank among the %0amusicians of that day. Nicomachus, too, it is said, was the %0apossessor of great numbers of precious stones, though selected %0awith but little taste. In mentioning these illustrations, by way %0aof prelude to this Book, it is by no means improbable that they %0amay have the appearance of being addressed to those, who, %0apiquing themselves upon a similar display, become puffed up %0awith a vanity which is evidently much more appropriate to a %0aperformer on the flute. %0a%0a6 "Achates."

WHO WERE THE MOST SKILFUL LAPIDARIES. THE FINEST SPECIMENS OF ENGRAVING ON PRECIOUS STONES. [[#chap4]]%0a%0aThe stone of the ring 11 which is now shown as that of Poly- %0acrates, is untouched and without engraving. In the time of %0alsmenias, long 12 after his day, it would appear to have become %0athe practice to engrave smaragdi even ; a fact which is estab- %0alished by an edict of Alexander the Great, forbidding his por- %0atrait to be cut upon this stone by any other engraver than %0aPyrgoteles, 13 who, no doubt, was the most famous adept in this %0aart. Since his time, Apollonides and Cronius have excelled in %0ait ; as also Dioscurides, 14 who engraved a very excellent likeness %0aof the late Emperor Augustus upon a signet, which, ever since, %0athe Roman emperors have used. The Dictator Sylla, it is %0asaid, always made use of a seal 15 which represented the sur- %0arender of Jugurtha. Authors inform us also, that the native %0aof Intercatia, 16 whose father challenged Scipio iEmilianus, 17 %0aand was slain by him, was in the habit of using a signet %0awith a representation of this conjbat engraved upon it ; a cir- %0acumstance which gave rise to the well-known joke of Stilo %0aProeconinus, 18 who naively enquired, what he would have done %0aif Scipio had been the person slain ? %0a%0aThe late Emperor Augustus was in the habit, at first, of %0ausing the figure of a Sphinx 19 for his signet ; having found %0atwo of them, among the jewels of his mother, that were per- %0afectly alike. During the Civil Wars, his friends used to employ %0aone of these signets, in his absence, for sealing such letters %0aand edicts as the circumstances of the times required to be %0aissued in his name; it being far from an unmeaning pleasantry %0a%0a11 This is said with reference to the one in the Temple of Concord, %0amentioned in Chapter 2. %0a%0a12 But see Exodus xxvii. 9, et. seq, where it is shown that the prac- %0atice existed many hundreds of years before. %0a%0a13 See B. vii. c. 38 ; where marble is the substance named. There are %0astill two gems in existence said to have been engraved by this artist; but %0aby some they are thought to be spurious. %0a%0a14 There are many precious stones with his name, still extant : but only %0asix appear to have been really engraved by him. %0a%0a15 This signet is mentioned also by Plutarch and Valerius Maxiraus. %0a%0a16 See B. iii. c. 4. %0a%0a17 The younger Africanus. This circumstance is mentioned in the %0aEpitome of Livy, B. xlviii. 18 See B. xxxiii. c. 5, and end of Book ix. %0a%0a" In reference to the ambiguous part which he acted, Ajaseou thinks, %0ain the early part of his career. %0a%0a%0a%0a390 %0a%0a%0a%0apliny's NATURAL 'HISTORY.

The frog, too, %0aon the seal of Maecenas, was held in great terror, by reason of %0athe monetary imposts which it announced. At a later period, %0awith the view of avoiding the sarcasms relative to the Sphinx, %0aAugustus made use of a signet with a figure upon it of Alex- %0aander the Great. %0a%0a!!CHAP. 5. — THE FIE8T DACTYLlOTHECiE AT BOME.

Varro and other authors of that period assure us, was %0agreatly superior to that of Scaurus. Following his example, %0athe Dictator Caesar consecrated six daetyliothecae in the Temple %0aof Venus Genetrix ; and Marcellus, the son of Octavia, 23 pre- %0asented one to the Temple of the Palatine Apollo. %0a%0a!!CHAP. 6. — JEWELS DISPLAYED AT BOME IN THE TBIUMPH OP POMPEIUS MAGNUS. [[#chap6]]%0a%0aBut it was this conquest by Pompeius Magnus that first %0aintroduced so general a taste for pearls and precious stones ; %0ajust as the victories, gained by L. Scipio 24 and Cneius Man- %0alius, 25 had first turned the public attention to chased silver, %0aAttalic tissues, and banquetting-couches decorated with bronze; %0aand the conquests of L. Muramius had brought Corinthian %0abronzes and pictures into notice. %0a%0a(2.) To prove more fully that this was the case, I will here %0agive the very words of the public Registers 36 with reference %0ato the triumphs of Pompeius Magnus. On the occasion of his %0athird triumph, over the Pirates and over the Kings and nations %0aof Asia and Pontus that have been already enumerated in the %0aSeventh Book 27 of this work, M. Piso and M.

Yes, I say, those frank features, so %0avenerated throughout all nations, were here displayed in pearls! %0athe severity of our ancient manners being thus subdued, and %0athe display being more the triumph of luxury than the triumph %0aof conquest. Never, most assuredly, would Pompeius have so %0along maintained his surname of "Magnus" among the men of %0athat day, if on the occasion of his first 33 conquest his triumph %0ahad been such as this. Thy portrait in pearls, 0 Magnus ! those %0aresources of prodigality, that have been discovered for the %0asake of females only ! Thy portrait in pearls, refinements in %0aluxury, which the Roman laws would not have allowed thee to %0awear even ! And was it in this way that thy value must be appre- %0aciated ? Would not that trophy have given a more truthful like- %0aness of thee which thouhadst erst erected upon the Pyrenaean 3 ' %0amountain heights ? Assuredly such a portrait as this had been %0ano less than a downright ignominy and disgrace, were we not %0abound to behold in it a menacing presage of the anger of the %0agods, and to see foreshadowed thereby the time when that head, %0anow laden with the wealth of the East, was to be displayed, %0asevered from the body. %0a%0a26 A%3cu-C . 693. 29 30th of September 30 " Alveum lusorium." %0a%0a31 Probably menning a shrine dedicated to the Muses. %0a%0a« See B. ii. c. 78, and B. vii. c. 60. 33 That of Africa. %0a%0a'* See B. vii. c. 27. %0a%0aM As was the case, after the murder of Pompey in Egypt. %0a%0a%0a%0a392 %0a%0a%0a%0aPLINY'S NATURAL HISTORY. [Book XXXVII. %0a%0a%0a%0aBut in other respects, how truly befitting the hero was this %0atriumph ! To the state, he presented two thousand millions of %0asesterces ; to the legati and quaestors who had exerted them- %0aselves in defence of the sea coast, he gave one thousand millions %0aof sesterces ; and to each individual soldier, six thousand ses- %0aterces. He has rendered, however, comparatively excusable %0athe Emperor Caius, S6 who, in addition to other feminine lux- %0auries, used to wear shoes adorned with pearls ; as also the %0aEmperor Nero, who used to adorn his sceptres with masks %0aworked in pearls, and had the couches, destined for his pleasures, %0amade of the same costly materials. Nay, we have no longer any %0aright, it would seem, to censure the employment of drinking- %0acups adorned with precious stones, of various other articles in %0adaily use that are similarly enriched, and of rings that 6parkle %0awith gems : for what species of luxury can there be thought of, %0athat was not more innocent in its results than this on the part of %0aPompeius ? %0a%0a!!CHAP. 7. AT WHAT PERIOD MURRHINE VESSELS WERE FIEST IN-TRODUCED AT ROME. INSTANCES OF LUXURY IN REFERENCE TO THEM. [[#chap7]]%0a%0aIt was the same conquest, too, that first introduced murrhine" %0avessels at Home ; Pompeius being the first to dedicate, at %0athe conclusion of this triumph, vases and cups, made of this %0amaterial, in the Temple of Jupiter Capitolinus : a circumstance %0awhich soon brought them into private use, waiters, even, and %0aeating-utensils made of murrhine being in great request. %0aThis species of luxury, too, is daily on the increase, a single %0acup, which would hold no more than three sextarii, having %0abeen purchased at the price of seventy thousand sesterces. A %0aperson of consular rank, who some years 38 ago used to drink %0aout of this cup, grew so passionately fond of it, as to gnaw its %0a%0a36 Caligula. %0a%0a37 Modern writers differ as to the material of which these vessels were %0acomposed. Some think that they were of variegated glass, and others of %0aonyx ; but the more general opiuion is, that they were Chinese porcelain, %0aand we have the line in Propertius, B. iv. El. 5, 1. 26. "And murrhine %0avessels baked on Parthian hearths." Ajasson is of opinion, from the de- %0ascription given by Pliny, that these vessels were made of Fluor spar, or %0afiliate of lime. " Myrrhine " is another reading of the word. %0a%0a38 "Ante hos annos." Sillig is of opinion that the reading here should %0abe " L. Annius," and that L. Annius Bassus, who was Consul suffectus in %0athe year 70 a.d., is the person referred to ; or possibly, T. Arrius Antoninus, %0a■who was Consul suffectus, a.d. 69. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 8.] %0a%0a%0a%0aTIIE NATTJBE OF MUBRTIINE VE8SELS. %0a%0a%0a%0a393 %0a%0a%0a%0aedges even, an injury, however, which has only tended to en- %0ahance its value : indeed there is now no vessel in murrhine that %0ahas ever been estimated at a higher figure than this. "We %0amay form some opinion how much money this same personage %0aswallowed up in articles of this description, from the fact that %0athe number of them was so great, that, when the Emperor %0aNero deprived his children of them, and they were exposed to %0apublic view, they occupied a whole theatre to themselves, in %0athe gardens beyond the Tiber ; a theatre which was found %0asufficiently large even, for the audience that attended on the %0aoccasion when Nero 39 rehearsed his musical performances before %0ahis appearance in the Theatre of Pompeius. It was at this %0aexhibition, too, that I saw counted the broken fragments of a %0asingle cup, which it was thought proper to preserve in an urn %0aand display, I suppose, with the view of exciting the sorrows %0aof the world, and of exposing the cruelty of fortune ; just as %0athough it had been no less than the body of Alexander the %0aGreat himself ! %0a%0aT. Petronius, 41 a personage of consular rank, intending, from %0ahis hatred of Nero, to disinherit the table of that prince, broke %0aa murrhine basin, which had cost him no less than three %0ahundred thousand sesterces. But Nero himself, as it was only %0aproper for a prince to do, surpassed them all, by paying one %0amillion of sesterces for a single cup : a fact well worthy of %0aremembrance, that an emperor, the father of his country, %0ashould have drunk from a vessel of such costly price ! %0a%0a!!CHAP. 8. THE NATURE OF MUBKHINE VESSELS. [[#chap8]]%0a%0aMurrhine vessels come from the East, in numerous localities %0aof which, remarkable for nothing else, they are to be found. %0aIt is in the empire of the Parthians, more particularly, that %0athey are met with, though those of the very finest quality %0acome to us from Carmania. 41 It is generally thought that %0athese vessels are formed of a moist substance, which under %0aground becomes solidified by heat. 42 In size they never ex- %0a%0a39 The Gardens of Nero, in the Fourteenth Eegion of the City. %0a%0a40 lie had been formerly a sharer in the debaucheries of Nero. Tacitus %0acalled him " Caius." 41 See B. vi. cc. 27, 28, 32. %0a%0a« Ajasson is of opinion that this passage bears reference to crystaUiza- %0a* tion. Both he and Desfontaines see in the present Chapter a very exact %0adescription of Fluor spar ; and there is certainly great difficulty in recog- %0a%0a%0a%0a394 %0a%0a%0a%0apliny's natural history. %0a%0a%0a%0a[Book XXXVII. %0a%0a%0a%0aceed a small waiter, 43 and, as to thickness, they rarely admit of %0aheing used as drinking-cups, so large as those already 41 men- %0ationed. The brightness of them is destitute of strength, and %0ait may be said that they are rather shining than brilliant. 45 %0aBut the chief merit of them is the great variety of their %0acolours, and the wreathed veins, which, every here and there, %0apresent shades of purple and white, with a mixture of the two ; %0athe purple gradually changing, as it were, to a fiery red, and %0athe milk-white assuming a ruddy hue. Some persons praise %0athe edges of these vessels more particularly, with a kind of %0areflection in the colours, like those beheld in the rain-bow. %0aOthers, again, are more pleased with them when quite opaque, %0ait being considered a demerit when they are at all transparent, %0aor of a pallid hue. The appearance, too, of crystals 46 in them %0ais highly prized, and of spots that look like warts ; not pro- %0aminent, but depressed, as we mostly see upon the human body. %0aThe perfume, 47 too, of which they smell, is looked upon as an %0aadditional recommendation. %0a%0a!!CHAP. 9 THE NATURE OF CRYSTAL. [[#chap9]]%0a%0aIt is a diametrically opposite cause to this that produces %0acrystal, 48 a substance which assumes a concrete form from ex- %0acessive congelation, 49 At all events, crystal is only to be found %0ain places where the winter snow freezes with the greatest in- %0atensity ; and it is from the certainty that it is a kind of ice, %0athat it has received the name 50 which it bears in Greek. The %0aEast, too, sends us crystal, there being none preferred to the pro- %0aduce of India. It is to be found, also, in Asia, that of the vicinity %0aof Alabanda, 61 Orthosia, 52 and the neighbouring mountains, %0abeing held in a very low degree of esteem.

According to %0aJuba, there is crystal in a certain island of the Red Sea, oppo- %0asite the coast of Arabia, called "Necron ;" 53 as, also, in ano- %0ather neighbouring island 51 which produces the precious stone %0aknown as the " topazus ;" where a block of crystal was ex- %0atracted, he says, by Pythagoras, the praefect of King Ptole- %0amaeus, no less than a cubit in length. %0a%0aCornelius Bocchus informs us that in Lusitania, there have %0abeen blocks of crystal found, of extraordinary weight, in sinking %0ashafts in the Ammiensian 55 mountains there, to a water-level %0afor the supply of wells. It is a marvellous fact, stated by Xeno- %0acrates of Ephesus, that in Asia and in the Isle of Cyprus, %0acrystal is turned up by the plough ; it having been the general %0abelief that it is never to be found in terreous soils, and only %0ain rocky localities. That is much more probable which the %0asame Xenocrates tells us, when he says that the mountain %0astreams often bring down with them fragments of crystal. %0aSudines says, that crystal is only to be found in localities that %0aface the south, a thing that is known to be really the fact : %0aindeed, it is never found in humid spots, however cold the %0aclimate may be, even though the rivers there freeze to the very %0abottom, llain- water and pure snow are absolutely necessary %0afor its formation, 56 and hence it is, that it is unable to endure %0aheat, being solely employed for holding liquids that are taken %0acold. From the circumstance of its being hexagonal 07 and %0ahexahedral, it is not easy to penetrate this substance ; and the %0amore so, as the pyramidal terminations do not always have %0athe same appearance. The polish on its faces is so exquisite, %0athat no art can possibly equal it. %0a%0a!!CHAP. 10. — LUXURY DISPLAYED IN THE USE OF CRYSTAL. REME-DIES DERIVED FROM CRYSTAL.

For my own part, I can %0apositively say, that there is crystal amid the crags of the Alps, %0aso difficult of access, that it is usually found necessary to be %0asuspended by ropes in order to extract it. Persons who are %0aexperienced in the matter detect its presence by certain signs %0aand indications. f %0a%0aCrystal is subject to numerous defects, sometimes present- %0aing a rough, solder-like, substance, or else clouded by spots %0aupon it; while occasionally it contains some hidden hu- %0amour 60 within, or is traversed by hard and brittle knurrs, 61 %0awhich are known as " salt grains." 62 Some crystal, too, has a %0ared rust upon it, while, in other instances, it contains fila- %0aments that look like flaws, a defect which artists conceal by %0aengraving it. But where crystals are entirely free from de- %0afect, they are preferred uncut ; in which case, they are known %0aas " acenteta," 63 and have the colour, not of foam, but of %0alimpid water. In the last place, the weight of crystals is a %0apoint which is taken into consideration. %0a%0aI find it stated by medical men that the very best cautery %0afor the human body is a ball of crystal acted upon by the rays %0aof the sun." This substance, too, has been made the object of %0aa mania ; for, not many years ago, a mistress of a family, %0awho was by no means very rich, gave one hundred and fifty %0athousand sesterces for a single basin made of crystal. Nero, %0aon receiving tidings that all was lost, in the excess of his %0afury, dashed two cups of crystal to pieces ; this being his last %0aact of vengeance upon his fellow-creatures, preventing any %0aone from ever drinking again from these vessels. Crystal, %0awhen broken, cannot by any possibility be mended.

A MI! Ell : THE MANY FALSEHOODS THAT HAVE BEEN TOLD ABOUT IT. [[#chap11]]%0a%0aNext in rank among the objects of luxury, we have amber; 65 %0aan article which, for the present, however, is in request among %0awomen 66 only. All these three last-mentioned substances hold %0athe same rank, no doubt, as precious stones ; the two former %0afor certain fair reasons ; crystal, because it is adapted for %0ataking cool drinks, and murrhine vessels, for taking drinks that %0aare either hot or cold. But as for amber, luxury has not been %0aable, as yet, to devise any justification for the use of it. This %0ais a subject which affords us an excellent opportunity of ex- %0aposing some of the frivolities and falsehoods of the Greeks ; %0aand I beg that my readers will only have patience with me %0awhile I do so, it being really worth while, for our own practi- %0acal improvement, to become acquainted with the marvellous %0astories which they have promulgated respecting amber. %0a%0aAfter Phaethon had been struck by lightning, his sisters, they %0atell us, became changed into poplars, 67 which every year shed %0atheir tears upon the banks of the Eridanus, a river known to %0aus as the "PaduB." To these tearswas given thename of "elec- %0atium," 68 from the circumstance that the Sun was usually called %0a" elector." Such is the story, at all events, that is told by %0amany of the poets, the first of whom were, in my opinion, %0a^Eschylus, Philoxenus, Euripides, Satyrus, andNicander; and %0athe falsity of which is abundantly proved upon the testi- %0amony of Italy itself. 69 Those among the Greeks who have %0adevoted more attention to the subject, have spoken of certain %0aislands in the Adriatic Sea, known as the " Electrides," and %0a%0a65 " Succinum " It is of vegetable origin, and, according to Goppert, %0awas originally the viscous resin of a tree named by him Finite* succinifer %0a« It is used by men, more particularly, at the present day, as a moutu- %0a%0aP ' e «" e As S the vegetable origin of amber, there is no doubt that the ancients %0a%0a"™ Uost probably from flAioff, the "sun."

It is the %0afact, however, that there never were any islands there so called, %0anor, indeed, any islands so situate as to allow of the Padua %0acarrying down anything in its course to their shores. As to %0a^Eschylus placing the Eridanus in Iberia, or, in other words, %0ain Spain, and giving it the name of Khodanus ; and as to %0aEuripides and Apollonius representing the llhodanus and the %0aPadus as discharging themselves by one common mouth on %0athe shores of the Adriatic ; we can forgive them all the more %0areadily for knowing nothing about amber when they betray %0asuch monstrous ignorance of geography. %0a%0aOther writers, again, who are more guarded in their assertions, %0ahave told us, though with an equal degree of untruthfulness, %0athat, at the extremity of the Adriatic Gulf, upon certain inac- %0acessible rocks there, there are certain trees 11 which shed their %0agum at the rising of the Dog-Star. Theophrastus 12 has stated %0athat amber is extracted from the earth in Liguria ; 13 Chares, %0athat Phaethon died in the territory of Hammon, in ^Ethiopia, %0awhere there is a temple of his and an oracle, and where amber %0ais produced; Philemon, that it is a fossil substance, and that %0ait is found in two different localities in Scythia, in one of %0awhich it is of a white and waxen colour, and is known as %0a" electrum ;" while in the other it is red, and is called " sua- %0aliternicum." Demostratus calls amber " lyncurion,"' 4 and he %0asays that it originates in the urine of the wild beast known as %0athe " lynx;" that voided by the male producing a red and fiery %0asubstance, and that by the female an amber of a white and %0aless pronounced colour : he also informs us that by some per- %0asons it is called " langurium," and that in Italy, there are %0acertain wild beasts known as " languri."

Sudines says, that it is a %0atree in reality, that produces amber, and that, in Etruria, this %0atree is known by the name of " lynx ;" an opinion which is %0aalso adopted by Metrodorus. Sotacus expresses a belief that %0aamber exudes from certain stones in Britannia, to which he %0agives the name of " electrides." Pytheas says that the %0aGutones, 75 a people of Germany, inhabit the shores of an %0asestuary of the Ocean called Mentonomon, their territory ex- %0atending a distance of six thousand stadia; that, at one day's %0asail from this territory, is the Isle of Abalus, upon the shores %0aof which, amber is thrown up by the waves in spring, it being %0aan excretion of the sea in a concrete form ; as, also, that the %0ainhabitants use this amber by way of fuel, and sell it to their %0aneighbours, the Teutones. Timaeus, too, is of the same be- %0alief, but he has given to the island the name of Basilia. 76 %0a%0aPhilemon says that electrum does not yield a flame. 77 Nicias, %0aagain, will have it, that it is a liquid produced by the rays of %0athe sun ; and that these rays, at the moment of the sun's %0asetting, striking with the greatest force upon the surface of %0athe soil, leave upon it an unctuous sweat, which is carried off %0aby the tides of the Ocean, and thrown up upon the shores of %0aGermany. He states, also, that in Egypt it is similarly pro- %0aduced, and is there called " sacal ;" 78 that it is found in India, %0atoo, where it is held as a preferable substitute for frankin- %0acense ; and that in Syria the women make the whirls of their %0aspindles of this substance, and give it the name of " harpax,"' 9 %0afrom the circumstance that it attracts leaves towards it, chaff, %0aand the light fringe of tissues. According to Theochrestus^ %0aamber is thrown up by the tides of the Ocean, at the foot of %0athe Pyrencean range ; an opinion adopted also by Xenocrates. %0aAsarubas, who has written the most recently upon these sub- %0ajects, and is still living, informs us, that near the shores of the %0aAtlantic is Lake Cephisis, known to the Mauri by the name %0aof " Electrum ;" and that when this lake is dried up by the %0asun, the slime of it produces amber, which floats upon %0athe surface.

Theomenes says that near the Greater %0aSyrtis are the Gardens of the Hesperides, and Lake Electrum : %0aon the banks, he says, are poplars, from the summits of which %0aamber falls into the water below, where it is gathered by the %0amaidens of the Hesperides. %0a%0aCtesias asserts that there is in India 81 a river called Hypo- %0abarus, a word which signifies " bearer of all good things ;" %0athat this river flows from the north into the Eastern Ocean, %0awhere it discharges itself near a mountain covered with trees %0awhich produce electrum ; and that these trees are called %0a" siptachorse," the meaning of which is " intense sweetness." %0aMithridates says, that off the shores of Germany there is an %0aisland called " Serita," 82 covered with a kind of cedar, from %0awhich amber falls upon the rocks. According to Xenocrates, %0athis substance is called, in Italy, not only " succinum," but %0a" thieum " as well, the Scythian name of it, for there also it %0ais to be found, being " sacrium :" others, he says, are of opi- %0anion that it is a product of Numidia. But the one that has %0asurpassed them all is Sophocles, the tragic poet ; a thing that %0aindeed surprises me, when I only consider the surpassing %0agravity of his lofty style, the high repute that he enjoyed in %0alife, his elevated position by birth at Athens, his various ex- %0aploits, and his high military command. According to him, %0aamber is produced in the countries beyond India, from the tears %0athat are shed for Meleager, by the birds called " meleagrides !" 83 %0a"Who can be otherwise than surprised that he should have be- %0alieved such a thing as this, or have hoped to persuade others %0ato believe it ? What child, too, could possibly be found in such %0aa state of ignorance as to believe that birds weep once a year, %0athat their tears are so prolific as this, or that they go all the %0away from Greece, where Meleager died, to India to weep ? %0a" But then," it will be said, " do not the poets tell many other %0astories that are quite as fabulous ?" Such is the fact, no doubt, %0a%0aso See B. x. c. 38. %0a%0a81 All this is based, Ajasson thinks, upon the stoiies of Hindoo mythology. %0a81 The old reading is " Osericta :" Ajasson identifies it with the island %0aof Oe'sel in the Baltic. 93 See B. x. c. 38. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 11.] %0a%0a%0a%0aAMBER. %0a%0a%0a%0a401 %0a%0a%0a%0abut for a person seriously to advance such an absurdity with %0areference to a thing so common as amber, which is imported %0aevery day and so easily proves the mendacity of this assertion, %0ais neither more nor less than to evince a supreme contempt %0afor the opinions of mankind, and to assert with impunity an %0aintolerable falsehood. %0a%0a(3.) There can be no doubt that amber is a product of the %0aislands of the Northern Ocean, and that it is the substance by %0athe Germans called " gla3sum ;" 84 for which reason the Eomans, %0awhen Germanicus Caesar commanded the fleet in those parts, %0agave to one of these islands the name of Glaesaria, 85 which by the %0abarbarians was known as Austeravia. Amber is produced from %0aa marrow discharged by trees belonging to the pine 86 genus, like- %0agum from the cherry, and resin from the ordinary pine. It is %0aa liquid at first, which issues forth in considerable quantities, %0aand is gradually hardened by heat or cold, or else by the action %0aof the sea, when the rise of the tide carries off the fragments %0afrom the shores of these islands. At all events, it is thrown %0aup upon the coasts, in so light and voluble a form that in the %0ashallows it has all the appearance of hanging suspended in the %0awater. Our forefathers, too, were of opinion that it is the juice %0aof a tree, and for this reason gave it the name of " succinum :" 87 %0aand one great proof that it is the produce of a tree of the pine %0agenus, is the fact that it emits a pine-like smell when rubbed, %0aand that it burns, when ignited, with the odour and appearance %0aof torch-pine wood. %0a%0aAmber is imported by the Germans into Pannonia, more %0aparticularly ; from whence the Veneti, by the Greeks called %0aEneti, first brought it into general notice, a people in the %0avicinity of Pannonia, and dwelling on the shores of the %0aAdriatic Sea. Prom this it is evident how the story which %0aconnects it with the Padus first originated ; and at the present %0aday we see the female peasantry in the countries that lie %0abeyond that river wearing necklaces of amber, principally %0aas an ornament, no doubt, but on account of its remedial virtues %0aas well ; for amber, it is generally believed, is good for affec- %0a%0a81 See B. iv. c.c. 27, 30, and the Notes. 85 See B. iv. c. 30. %0a%0a86 It is just possible that the Pinites succinifer may have still existed, %0ato some extent, eighteen hundred years ago.

Traversing the coasts of that country %0aand visiting the various markets there, he brought back amber, %0ain such vast quantities, as to admit of the nets, which are used %0afor protecting the podium 89 against the wild beasts, being %0astudded 90 with amber. %0a%0aThe arms too, the litters, 91 and all the other apparatus, were, %0aon one day, decorated with nothing but amber, a different kind %0aof display being made each day that these spectacles were exhi- %0abited. The largest piece of amber that this personage brought %0ato Home was thirteen pounds in weight. %0a%0aThat amber is found in India too, is a fact well ascertained. %0aArchelaiis, who reigned over Cappadocia, says that it is brought %0afrom that country in the rough state, and with the fine bark %0astill adhering to it, it being the custom there to polish it by %0aboilirjg it in the grease of a sucking-pig. One great proof that %0aamber must have been originally in a liquid state, is the fact %0athat, owing to its transparency, certain objects are to be seen %0awithin, ants for example, gnats, and lizards. These, no doubt, %0amust have first adhered to it while liquid, and then, upon its %0ahardening, have remained enclosed within. 92 %0a%0aCHAP. 12.

Ep. 15. %0a%0a93 These so-called kinds or varieties are mostly accidental variation* %0aonly in appearance. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 12.] %0a%0a%0a%0aAMBEB. %0a%0a%0a%0a403 %0a%0a%0a%0athat has the finest odour; 94 but neither this nor the wax-coloured %0aamber is held in very high esteem. The red amber is more %0ahighly valued ; and still more so, -when it is transparent, with- %0aout presenting too brilliant and igneous an appearance. For %0aamber, to be of high quality, should present a brightness like %0athat of fire, but not flakes resembling those of flame. The %0amost highly esteemed amber is that known as the " Falernian," %0afrom its resemblance to the colour of Falernian wine ; it is %0aperfectly transparent, and has a softened, transparent, brightness. %0aOther kinds, again, are valued for their mellowed tints, like the %0acolour of boiled honey in appearance. It ought to be known, %0ahowever, that any colour can be imparted to amber that may %0abe desired, it being sometimes stained with kid-suet and root %0aof alkanet ; indeed, at the present day, amber is dyed purple %0aeven. "When a vivifying heat has been imparted to it by %0arubbing it between the fingers, amber will attract chaff, dried %0aleaves, and thin bark, just in the same way that the magnet %0aatt racts iron. Pieces of amber, steeped in oil, burn with a more %0abrilliant and more lasting flame than pith of flax. 95 %0a%0aSo highly valued is this as an object of luxury, that a very %0adiminutive human effigy, made of amber, has been known to sell %0aat a higher price than living men even, in stout and vigorous %0ahealth. This single ground for censure, however, is far from %0abeing sufficient ; in Corinthian objects of vertu, it is the copper %0athat recommends them, combined with silver and gold ; and in %0aembossed works it is the skill and genius of the artist that %0ais so highly esteemed. We have already said what it is that %0arecommends vessels of murrhine and of crystal ; pearls, too, are %0aof use for wearing upon the head, and gems upon the fingers. %0aIn the case of all other luxuries, in fact, it is either a spirit of %0aostentation or some utility that has been discovered in them %0athat pleads so strongly in their behalf; but in that of amber %0awe have solely the consciousness that we are enjoying a luxury, %0aand nothing more.

As fine names, %0atoo, are never wanting for bodily defects, a third tint has been %0aintroduced of late for hair among our ladies, under the name of %0a" amber-colour." %0a%0aAmber, however, is not without its utility in a medicinal %0apoint of view ; though it is not for this reason that the women %0aare so pleased with it. It is beneficial for infants also, attached %0ato the body in the form of an amulet ; and, according to Callis- %0atratus, it is good for any age, as a preventive of delirium and as %0aa cure for strangury, either taken in drink or attached as an %0aamulet to the body. This last author, too, has invented a new %0avariety of amber ; giving the name of " chryselectrum" 96 to an %0aamber of a golden colour, and which presents the most beauti- %0aful tints in the morning. This last kind attracts flame, too, %0awith the greatest rapidity, and, the moment it approaches the %0afire, it ignites. Worn upon the neck, he says, it is a euro %0afor fevers and other diseases, and, triturated with honey and %0aoil of roses, it is good for maladies of the ears. Beaten up %0awith Attic honey, it is good for dimness of sight ; and the %0apowder of it, either taken by itself or with gum mastich in %0awater, is remedial for diseases of the stomach.

They assert, too, that it is a product of %0athe urine of the lynx and of a kind of earth, the animal %0acovering up the urine the moment it has voided it, from a %0ajealousy that man should gain possession of it ; a combination %0awhich hardens into stone.

Such was the name given to %0aa nodosity of gold, 2 sometimes, though but rarely, found in the %0amines, in close proximity with gold, and only there to be %0afound, it was thought. The ancients supposed that adamas %0awas only to be discovered in the mines of ^Ethiopia, 3 between %0athe Temple of Mercury and the island of Meroe ; and they %0ahave informed us that it was never larger than a cucumber- %0aseed, or differing at all from it in colour. %0a%0aAt the present day, for the first time, there are no less than %0asix different varieties of it recognized. The Indian adamas is %0afound, not in a stratum of gold, but in a substance of a %0akindred nature to crystal ; which it closely resembles in its %0atransparency and its highly polished hexangular and hexahe- %0adral 4 form. In shape it is turbinated, running to a point at %0aeither extremity, and closely resembling, marvellous to think %0aof, two cones united at the base. In size, too, it is as large %0aeven as a hazel-nut. Resembling that of India, is the adamas 4 %0aof Arabia, which is found in a similar bed, but not so large in %0asize. Other varieties have a pallid hue like that of silver, %0aand are only to be found in the midst of gold of the very %0afinest quality. These stones are tested upon the anvil, and %0awill resist the blow to such an extent, as to make the iron re- %0abound and the very anvil split asunder. 6 Indeed its hardness %0ais beyond all expression, while at the same time it quite sets %0afire at defiance 7 and is incapable of being heated ; owing to %0a%0aspecular iron ore, emery, and other substances of rather high degrees of %0ahardness, which cannot now be identified. It is doubtful whether Pliny %0ahad any acquaintance with the real diamond." — System of Mineralogy, Art. %0aDiamond. We may also add, from the same authority, that the method of %0apolishing diamonds was first discovered in 1456, by Louis Berquen, a citizen %0aof Bruges, previous to which time the diamond was only known in iu %0anative uncut state. %0a%0a2 This statement cannot apply to the "diamond" as known to us, %0athough occasionally grains of gold have been found in the vicinity of the %0adiamond. %0a%0a3 Ajasson is of opinion that the Ethiopia here mentioned is in reality %0aIndia, and that the "Temple of Mercury" means the Brahmaloka, or Tem- %0aple of Brahma. %0a%0a* The diamond, as known to us, is octahedral. %0a%0a5 Though found in comparative abundance in India, the diamond is not %0afound in Arabia. %0a%0a6 This is not the case with the diamond ; for on being struck under such %0acircumstances, it will break. %0a%0a1 In reality, the diamond will burn, and, at a temperature of 14° Wedge- %0awood, is wholly consumed, producing carbonic acid gas. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 15.

We next %0acome to the Cyprian 11 adamas, so called from its being found %0ain the Isle of Cyprus : it is of a colour somewhat inclining to %0athat of copper, but, in reference to its medicinal virtues, of %0awhich we shall have to make further mention, it is the most %0aefficacious of them all. Next in succession to this we have %0a6iderite8, 12 a stone which shines like iron, and is more ponderous %0athan any of the others, but differs in its properties from them %0aall. For it breaks when struck by the hammer, and admits of %0abeing perforated by other kinds of adamas ; a thing which is %0athe case, also, with that of Cyprus : in short, these two are %0adegenerate stones, and only bear the name of "adamas" for %0athe purpose of enhancing their value. %0a%0aNow with reference to those affinities and repugnances which %0aexist between certain objects, known to the Greeks as sym- %0apathia" and " antipathia," phenomena to which we have en- %0adeavoured 13 to draw attention thoughout these books, they no- %0awhere manifest themselves with greater distinctness than here. %0aThis indomitable power, in fact, which sets at nought the %0atwo most violent agents in Nature, fire, namely, and iron, is %0amade to yield before the blood of a he-goat. u The blood, %0ahowever must be no otherwise than fresh and warm ; the stone, %0atoo, must be well steeped in it, and then subjected to repeated %0ablows : and even then, it is apt to break both anvils and ham- %0amers of iron, if they are not of the very finest temper. To %0awhat spirit of research, or to what accident, are we indebted for %0athis discovery ? or what conjecture can it have been, that first %0a%0a8 See Note 1, above. 9 "Millet-seed." %0a%0a10 Ajasson 6ays, that no doubt this adamas was Adamantine, or limpid %0aCorundum. %0a%0a11 Ajasson suggests that this may have been Dichroite, or Cordierite, %0aknown also as Iolite, or Water sapphire. %0a%0a12 Possibly the Siderite, sparry iron, or spathic iron of modern Min- %0aeralogy. Ajasson is inclined to think that it is Corundum, of a dark hue. %0a%0a13 See B. xx. c. 1, B. xxviii. cc. 23, 41, and B. xxxii. c. 12 %0a%0a14 Brotero thinks that this was a story invented by the dealers, with a %0aview of concealing the real method of breaking the stone. %0a%0a%0a%0a408 %0a%0a%0a%0apliny's natural itistokt. %0a%0a%0a%0a[Book XXXVII. %0a%0a%0a%0aled man to experiment upon a thing of such extraordinary %0avalue as this, and that, too, with the most unclean 14 of all %0aanimals ? Surely a discovery, such as this, must have been due %0asolely to the munificence of the gods, and we must look for %0athe reason of it in none of the elementary operations of %0aNature, but wholly in her will. %0a%0aWhen, by good fortune, this stone does happen to be broken, %0ait divides into fragments so minute as to be almost impercep- %0atible. These particles are held in great request by engravers, %0awho enclose them in iron, and are enabled thereby, with the %0agreatest facility, to cut 16 the very hardest substances known. %0aSo great is the antipathy borne by this stone to the magnet, %0athat when placed near, it will not allow of its attracting %0airon; or if the magnet has already attracted the iron, it will %0aseize the metal and drag it away from the other. 17 Adamas, %0atoo, overcomes and neutralizes poisons, dispels delirium, and %0abanishes groundless perturbations of the mind ; hence it is %0athat some have given it the name of " ananchites." 18 Mctro- %0adorus of Scepsis is the only author, that I know of, who says %0athat this stone is found also in Germany, and in the island of %0aBasilia, 19 where amber is found. He says, too. that this is pre- %0aferable to the stone of Arabia ; but can there be any doubt %0athat his statement is incorrect ? %0a%0aCHAP. 16. — SMARAGDTJS. %0a%0aNext 20 in esteem with us are the pearls of India and Arabia, %0aof which we have already spoken in the Ninth Book, 21 when %0atreating of the marine productions. %0a%0a(5.)

This word, as it is here given, %0awould appear to be derived from the Greek d privative, and dy^o/tai, %0a" to strangle oneself," and to mean, "preventive of suicide." %0a%0a19 See B. iv. c. 27, and Chapter 11 of this Book. %0a%0a20 At the present day the ruby is next in esteem to the diamond. %0a%0a21 Chapter 54, et teq. %0a%0a%0a%0aCbap. 16.] %0a%0a%0a%0aSHAKAGDUS. %0a%0a%0a%0a409 %0a%0a%0a%0athe smaragdus. 22 Indeed there is no stone, the colour of which %0ais more delightful to the eye ; for whereas the sight fixes itself %0awith avidity upon the green 23 grass and the foliage of the trees, %0awe have all the more pleasure in looking upon the smaragdus, %0athere being no green in existence of a more intense colour 21 %0athan this. And then, besides, of all the precious stones, this is %0athe only one that feeds the sight without satiating it. Even %0awhen the vision has been fatigued with intently viewing other %0aobjects, it is refreshed by being turned upon this stone ; and %0alapidaries know of nothing that is more gratefully soothing to %0athe eyes, its soft green tints being wonderfully adapted for %0aassuaging lassitude, when felt in those organs. %0a%0aAnd then, besides, when viewed from a distance, these stones %0aappear all the larger to the sight, reflecting as they do, their %0agreen hues upon the circumambient air. Neither sunshine, %0ashade, nor artificial light effects any change in their appearance ; %0athey have always a softened and graduated brilliancy ; and %0atransmitting the light with facility, they allow the vision to %0apenetrate their interior ; a property which is so pleasing, also, %0awith reference to water. In form they are mostly concave, so %0aas to re-unite the rays of light and the powers of vision : %0aand hence it is, that it is so universally agreed upon among %0amankind to respect these stones, and to forbid their surface 25 %0ato be engraved. In the case, however, of the stones of Scythia %0aand Egypt, their hardness is such, that it would be quite im- %0apossible to penetrate them. When the surface of the smaragdus %0ais flat, it reflects the image of objects in the same manner as %0aa mirror. The Emperor Nero used to view 26 the combats of %0athe gladiators upon a smaragdus. %0a%0a22 The Emerald, and various other green precious stones, were included %0aunder this name. %0a%0a23 " Virentes" seems a very preferable reading to "silentes," as given %0aby the Bamberg MS. %0a%0a24 The emerald is supposed to derive this colour from a minute portion %0aof oxide of chrome. %0a%0aM Engraved emeralds are but seldom found among collections of ancient %0agems. In 1593, there was one found in tbe tomb of Maria, daughter of %0aStilicho, in the Vatican, with the head of llonorius, her husband, engraved %0aupon it. . %0a%0a56 " It may here be objected that real emeralds are too small to admit %0aof being used as mirrors ; but the ancients speak of some sufficiently large %0afor that purpose, and also of artificial ones; so that we may with certainty %0aconclude, that they classed among the emeralds fluor spar, green vitrified %0a%0a%0a%0a410 %0a%0a%0a%0aflint's natubal histoet. %0a%0a%0a%0a[Rook XXXVII. %0a%0a%0a%0aCHAP. 17. — TWELVE VARIETIES OF THE SMABAGDUS. %0a%0aOf this stone there are no less than twelve different kinds; %0aof which the finest is the Scythian 28 sraaragdus, so called from %0athe country where it is found. None of them has a deeper %0acolour than this, or is more free from defects : indeed, in the %0asame degree that the smaragdus is superior to other precious %0astones, the Scythian smaragdus is superior to the other varie- %0aties. Next in esteem to this, as also in locality, is the smarag- %0adus of Bactriana. 29 These stones are collected, it is said, in the %0afissures of rocks, when the Etesian 30 winds prevail ; a period %0aat which the earth that covers them is removed, and the stones %0aare detected by their brightness, the sands being greatly agi- %0atated by the action of the winds. These last, however, are %0amuch inferior, they say, to those of Scythia in size. The third %0arank is held by the stones of Egypt, 31 which are extracted from %0athe hills in the vicinity of Coptos, a city of Thebais. %0a%0aAll the other kinds are found in copper-mines, and hence it %0ais that, of these varieties, the smaragdus of Cyprus holds the %0ahighest rank. The merit of them consists in their clear colour, %0awhich has nothing thin or diluted in it, but presents a rich %0aand humid transparency, closely resembling the tints of the %0asea, in fact. Hence it is that these stones are at once diapha- %0anous and shining, or, in other words, reflect their colours and %0aallow the vision to penetrate within. They say that in this %0aisland, upon the tomb of a petty king named Hermias, near %0athe fisheries 32 there, there was formerly a lion in marble, with %0aeyes made of smaragdi; the brilliancy of which penetrated %0a%0alava, or the green Icelandic agate, as it is called, green jasper, and also green %0aglass." — Beckmann, Hist. Inv. Vol. II. p. 67. Bohn's Edition. It has %0aalso been suggested, with reference to this passage, that Nero was short- %0asighted, and that this emerald was formed like a concave lens. The passage, %0ahowever, will hardly support such a construction. Ajasson thinks that it %0amust have been a Dioptase or Siberian emerald ; or else a green Corundum. %0a%0a28 Ajasson is of opinion that the Dioptase, Siberian emerald, or Mala- %0achite emerald is meant. %0a%0a" Ajasson thinks that this may be the Dioptase or Achirite of Chinese %0aBucharia; and that the merchant Achir Mahmed, from whom it takes its %0aname, was by no means the first to4ntroduce it, or to circulate his wonder- %0aful stories as to its formation. %0a%0a30 See B. ii. cc. 47, 48, and B. xviii. c. 74. %0a%0a31 Mount Zalora. in Upper Egypt, still produces emeralds, and was pro- %0abably the only locality of the genuine stone that was known to the ancients. %0a%0a32 "Cetarias." %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 18.] %0a%0a%0a%0aDEFECTS IK THE SMABAGDUS. %0a%0a%0a%0a411 %0a%0a%0a%0athe sea to such a degree, as to alarm the tunnies and put them %0ato flight : a novel circumstance, which for a long time excited %0awonder in the fishermen, till at last the stones in the statue %0awere changed for others. %0a%0aCHAP. 18. — DEFECTS IN THE SMA.RAGDTJ8. %0a%0aIt will he only proper, too, seeing that the prices of these %0astones are so exorbitant, to point out their defects, gome %0adefects, no doubt, are common to all of them, while others, %0aagain, like those found in the human race, are peculiar only %0ato those of a certain country. Thus, for example, the stones %0aof Cyprus are not all green alike, and in the same smaragdus %0asome parts are more or less so than others, the stone not always %0apreserving that uniform deep tint which characterizes the sma- %0aragdus of Scythia. In other instances, a shadow runs through %0athe stone, aqd the colour becomes dulled thereby ; the conse- %0aquence of which is, that its value is depreciated ; and even %0amore so, when the colour is thin and diluted. %0a%0aIn consequence of the defects 33 in these stones, they have %0abeen divided into several classes. Some of them are obscure, %0aand are then known as " blind" stones; some have a certain %0adensity, which impairs their transparency ; others, again, are %0amottled, and others covered with a cloud. This cloud, how- %0aever, is altogether different from the shadow above mentioned ; %0afor it is a defect which renders the stone of a whitish hue, and %0anot of a transparent green throughout ; presenting, as it does, in %0athe interior or upon the surface, a certain degree of whiteness %0awhich arrests the vision. Other defects, again, in these stones, %0aare filaments, salt-like 31 grains, or traces of lead ore, faults %0awhich are mostly common to them all. %0a%0aNext after the kinds above described, the smaragdus of %0a^Ethiopia is held in high esteem ; being found, as Juba tells %0aus, at a distance of twenty-five days' journey from Coptos. %0aThese are of a bright green, but are seldom to be met with per- %0afectly clear or of an uniform colour. Democritus includes in %0athis class the stones that are known as " herminei," and as %0a" Persian" stones ; the former of which are of a convex, %0a%0a33 Ajasson remarks that the greater part of the defects here described %0abelong in reality to the Dioptase. %0a31 " Sal."

In the sun, he says, they lose their %0abrilliancy, but they are radiant in the shade, the brightness of %0athem being seen at a greater distance than in the case of other %0astones. One other fault, too, in all these stones is, that they %0aoften have a colour like that of honey or rancid oil, or else %0aare clear and transparent, but not green. %0a%0aThese defects exist in the smaragdi of Attica, 35 more par- %0aticularly, which are found in the silver-mines there, at a place %0aknown by the name of Thoricos. 36 These last are never so %0amassive as the others, and are always more pleasing to the %0asight when viewed from a distance : lead ore, too, is often to %0abe detected in them, or, in other words, they have a leaden %0aappearance when looked at in the sun. 37 One peculiarity in %0athem is, that some of them become impaired by age, gradually %0alose their green colour, and are even deteriorated by expo- %0asure to the sun. Next to the stones of Attica come those of %0aMedia, a variety which presents the most numerous tints of all, %0aand sometimes approaches sapphiros 38 in colour. These stones %0aare wavy, 39 and represent various natural objects, such as %0apoppy-heads, for example, birds, the young of animals, and %0afeathers : all of them appear naturally of a green colour, but %0abecome improved by the application of oil. No stones of this %0aspecies are of a larger size than these. %0a%0aI am not aware that any of these stones 40 are still in exist- %0aence at Chalcedon, the copper mines of that locality being now %0aexhausted : but be this as it may, they were always the smallest %0ain size and the most inferior in value. Brittle, and of a colour %0a%0a55 Ajasson is of opinion that Diallage is here meant, known also hy the %0anames of Bronzite, schillerspath, schillerstein, and omphasite. %0a%0a36 See B. iv. c. 11. %0a%0a37 " In sole" seems a preferable reading to " in solo," " on the ground," %0aas given by the Bamberg MS. %0a%0a38 See Chapter 39 of this Book ; where it will be shown that this pro- %0abably is not the modern Sapphire. %0a%0a38 Ajasson suggests that these may have been Quartz agates of the %0adendritic or arborized kind. %0a%0a40 He probably alludes here to some variety of the Chalcedony or Opal %0aquartz. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 19.] TANOS. 413 %0a%0afar from distinctly pronounced, the)- resembled in their tints %0athe feathers that are seen in the tail of the peacock or on the %0anecks of pigeons.' 10 * More or less brilliant, too, according to the %0aangle at which they were viewed, they presented an appearance %0alike that of veins and scales. There was another defect, also, %0apeculiar to these stones, known as " sarcion," from the circum- %0astance that a kind of flesh 41 appeared to attach itself to the %0astone. The mountain near Chalcedon, where these stones were %0agathered, is still known by the name of " Smaragdites." Juba %0ainforms us that a kind of smaragdus, known as " cloras," 42 is %0aused in Arabia as an ornament for buildings, as also the stone %0awhich by the people of Egypt is called " alabastrites." On the %0asame authority, too, we learn that there are several varieties %0aof the smaragdus in the neighbouring mountains, and that %0astones like those of Media are found in Mount Taygetus, 43 as %0aalso in Sicily. %0a%0aCHAP. 19. THE PRECIOUS STONE CALLED TANOS.

BERYLS : EIGHT VARIETIES OF THEM. DEFECTS IN %0a%0aBERYLS. %0a%0aBeryls, it is thought, are of the same 50 nature as the smarag- %0adus, or at least closely analogous. India 61 produces them, and %0athey are rarely to be found elsewhere. The lapidaries cut all %0aberyls of an hexagonal 53 form ; because the colour, which is %0adeadened by a dull uniformity of surface, is heightened by the %0areflection resulting from the angles. If they are cut in any %0aother way, these stones have no brilliancy whatever. The most %0aesteemed beryls are those which in colour resemble the pure %0agreen of the sea ; 53 the chrysoberyP 1 being next in value, a stone %0aof a somewhat paler colour, but approaching a golden tint. %0aClosely allied to this last in its brilliancy, but of a more pallid %0a%0a47 Herodotus mentions tbis smaragdus and the temple, B. ii. c. 44, as %0ahaving been seen by himself. %0a%0a48 " Iaspis." See Chapter 37 of this Book. %0a%0a49 Meaning " the conqueror of many," probably ; in reference to his %0acontentious disposition. See end of B. xxx. %0a%0a60 The Beryl and the Emerald are only varieties of the same species, the %0alatter owing its colour to oxide of chrome, the former to oxide of iron. %0a%0a51 The best Beryls are found in Siberia, Hindostan, Brazil, and the %0aUnited States. %0a%0a6 - The crystals are naturally hexagonal. %0a%0a53 Hence the name of the sky-blue, or mountain-green beryl, aqua- %0amarine. %0a%0a54 Or " golden beryl." The modern Chrysoberyl is altogether a differ- %0aent stone from the one here described, which probably is identical with %0aChrysoprase or leek-green Chalcedony, the stone next mentioned. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 21.] %0a%0a%0a%0a0PAL8. %0a%0a%0a%0a415 %0a%0a%0a%0acolour, and thought by some to constitute a separate genus, is %0achrysoprasus. 55 In the fourth rank are reckoned the hyacin- %0athine beryls ; and in the fifth, those known as " aeroides." 50 %0aNext, we have the wax-coloured beryls, and, after them, the %0aoleaginous beryls, so called from the resemblance of their colour %0ato that of oil. Last of all, there are the stones which closely %0aresemble crystal in appearance ; mostly disfigured by spots and %0afilaments, and of a poor, faint, colour as well ; all of them so %0amany imperfections in the stone. %0a%0aThe people of India are marvellously fond of beryls of an %0aelongated 67 form, and say that these are the only precious stones %0athey prefer wearing without the addition of gold : hence it is %0athat, after piercing them, they string them upon the bristles of %0athe elephant. It is generally agreed, however, that those %0astones should not be perforated which are of the finest quality; %0aand in this case they only enclose the extremities of them in %0astuds of gold. They prefer, too, cutting the beryls in a cylin- %0adrical form, instead of setting them as precious stones ; an elon- %0agated shape being the one that is most highly esteemed. Some %0aare of opinion that beryls are naturally angular, 58 and that %0awhen pierced they become improved in colour ; the white sub- %0astance being thus removed that lies within, and their brilliancy %0aheightened by the reflection of the gold in which they are set ; %0aor, at all events, their transparency being increased by this %0adiminution in their thickness. In addition to the defects %0aalready 69 mentioned, and which are pretty nearly the same as %0athose to which the smaragdus is subject, beryls are affected with %0acloudy spots, 60 like those on the finger-nails in appearance. In %0aour own part of the world, it is thought that they are sometimes %0afbund in the countries that lie in the vicinity of Pontus. 61 The %0apeople of India, by colouring crystal, have found a method of %0aimitating various precious stones, beryls in particular. %0a%0achap. 21.

India, too, %0ais the sole 63 parent of these precious stones, thus completing %0aher glory as being the great producer of the most costly gems. %0aOf all precious stones, it is opal that presents the greatest dif- %0aficulties of description, it displaying at once the piercing fire %0aof carbunculus, 64 the purple brilliancy of amethystos, and the %0asea-green of smaragdus, the whole blended together and reful- %0agent with a brightness that is quite incredible. Some authors %0ahave compared the effect of its refulgence to that of the colour %0aknown as Armenian 86 pigment, while others speak of it as re- %0asembling the flame of burning sulphur, or of flame fed with %0aoil. In size, the opal is about as large as a hazel-nut, 00 and, %0awith reference to it, there is a remarkable historical anecdote %0arelated. For there is still in existence a stone of this class, on %0aaccount of which Antonius proscribed the senator Nonius, son %0aof the Nonius Struma, whom the poet Catullus 67 was so dis- %0apleased at seeing in the curule chair, and grandfather of the %0aServilius Nonianus, who in our own times was consul. 68 On %0abeing thus proscribed, Nonius took to flight, carrying with %0ahim, out of all his wealth, nothing but this ring, the value of %0awhich, it is well known, was estimated at two millions of ses- %0aterces. How marvellous must have been the cruelty, how mar- %0avellous the luxurious passion of Antonius, thus to proscribe a %0aman for the possession of a jewel ! and no less marvellous must %0ahave been the obstinacy of Nonius, who could thus dote upon %0awhat had been the cause of his proscription ; for we see the %0avery brutes even tear off the portion of their body for the sake %0aof which they know their existence to be imperilled, 69 and so %0aredeem themselves by parting with it. %0a%0aCHAP. 22.

There is no stone %0athat is imitated by fraudulent dealers with more exactness than %0athis, in glass, the only mode of detecting the imposition being %0aby the light of the sun. For when a false 71 opal is held between %0athe finger and thumb, and exposed to the rays of that luminary, %0ait presents but one and the same transparent colour throughout, %0alimited to the body of the stone : whereas the genuine opal %0aoffers various refulgent tints in succession, and reflects now %0aone hue and now another, as it sheds its luminous brilliancy %0aupon the fingers. %0a%0aThis stone, in consequence of its extraordinary beauty, has %0abeen called " paederos" 72 by many authors ; and some who make %0aa distinct species of it, say that it is the same as the stone that in %0aIndia is called " sangenon." These last-mentioned stones, it %0ais said, are found in Egypt also, Arabia, and, of very inferior %0aquality, in Pontus. Galatia, too, is said to produce them, as %0aalso Tbasos and Cyprus. The finest in quality of them have %0aall the beauty of opal, but they are of a softer brilliancy, and %0aare mostly rough on the surface. Their colour is a mixture of %0asky-blue and purple, and the green hues of the smaragdus are %0awanting : those, too, are preferred, which have their brilliancy %0adeepened by a vinous hue, rather than those which have their %0acolours diluted, as it were, with water. %0a%0aCHAP. 23. — SARDONYX ; THE SEVERAL VARIETIES OF IT.

There is less certainty with respect to %0athose upon which the men as well have been left to form a %0ajudgment; seeing that the value of each stone depends more %0aparticularly upon the caprice of the individual and the rivalry %0athat exists in reference thereto ; as, for example, when Claudius %0aCaesar was so much in the habit of wearing the smaragdus and %0athe sardonyx. 74 The first Roman who wore a sardonyx, ac- %0acording to Demostratus, was the elder Africanus, since whose %0a%0a71 This is the case with common opal, as distinguished from precious opal. %0a" " Lovely youth." , . _ %0a%0a73 Said ironically.

Such, according to Ismenias, Deraostratus, %0aZenothemis, and Sotacus, is the sardonyx of India ; the last %0atwo giving the name of " blind" sardonyx to all the other %0astones of this class which are not transparent, and which have %0anow entirely appropriated the name to themselves. For, at %0athe present day, the Arabian sardonyx presents no traces what- %0aever of the Indian sarda, 76 it being a stone that has been found %0ato be characterized by several different colours of late ; black %0aor azure for the base, and vermilion, surrounded with a line of %0arich white, for the upper part, not without a certain glimpse 71 %0aof purple as the white passes into the red. 78 %0a%0aWe learn from Zenothemis that in his time these stones %0awere not held by the people of India in any high esteem, al- %0athough they are found there of so large a size as to admit of %0athe hilts of swords being made of them. It is well known, too, %0athat in that country they are exposed to view by the mountain- %0astreams, and that in our part of the world they were formerly %0avalued from the fact that they are nearly the only ones 79 among %0athe engraved precious stones that do not bring away the wax %0awhen an impression is made. The consequence is, that our %0aexample has at last taught the people of India to set a value %0aupon them, and the lower classes there now pierce them even, %0ato wear them as ornaments for the neck ; the great proof, in %0afact, at the present day, of a sardonyx being of Indian origin. %0aThose of Arabia are remarkable for their marginal line of %0abrilliant white, of considerable breadth, and not glistening in %0ahollow fissures in the stone or upon the sides, but shining upon %0athe very surface, at the margin, and supported by a ground %0aintensely black beneath.

In some of these stones, too, there is a play %0aof colours like those of the rainbow, while the surface is redder %0aeven than the shell of the sea-locust. 81 %0a%0aThose stones which are like honey in appearance, or of a %0afaeculent 82 colour — such being the name given to one defect in %0athem — are generally disapproved of. They are rejected also %0awhen the white zone blends itself with the other colours, and %0aits limits are not definitely marked ; or if, in like manner, it is %0airregularly intersected by any other colour ; it being looked %0aupon as an imperfection if the regularity of any one of the %0acolours is interrupted by the interposition of another. The %0asardonyx of Armenia is held in some esteem, but the zone %0around it is of a pallid hue. %0a%0aCHAP. 24. ONYX : THE SEVERAL VARIETIES OF IT. %0a%0aWe must give some account also of onyx, 83 because of %0athe name which it partly shares in common with sardonyx. %0aThis name, though in some places 84 given to a marble, is %0ahere used to signify a precious stone. Sudines says, that in this %0astone there is a white portion which resembles the white of %0athe human-fingernail, in addition to the colours of chrysolithos, %0asarda, and iaspis. According to Zenothemis, there are numerous %0avarieties of the Indian onyx, the fiery- coloured, the black, and %0athe cornel, with white veins encircling them, like an eye as it %0awere, and in some cases running across them obliquely. 85 %0aSotacus mentions an Arabian onyx, which differs from the rest. ; %0athat of India, according to him, presenting small flames, 86 each %0asurrounded by one or more white zones ; in a manner altogether %0adifferent from the Indian sardonyx, which presents a series of %0awhite specks, while in this case it is one continuous circle. %0aThe Arabian onyx, on the other hand, is black, he says, with a %0awhite zone encircling it. %0a%0aSatyrus says, that there is an onyx in India of a flesh %0a%0a80 A variety, probably, of common Chalcedony. %0a« See B. ix. cc. 74, 88, and B. xxxii. c. 53. %0a82 « Ffficulenta;," of the colour of wine-lees. %0a%0am So called from vwK, a "finger-nail."

The real onyx, according to him, has numerous %0aveins of variegated colours, interspersed with others of a milk- %0awhite hue ; the shades of which, as they pass into one another, %0aproduce a tint which surpasses all description, and blends itself %0ainto one harmonious whole, of a most beautiful appearance. %0a%0aNot unlike sardonyx, too, is sarda, 88 a stone which also has, %0ain part, a kindred name with it ; but before passing on to it, %0awe must first take some notice of all those precious stones which %0ahave a brilliancy like that of flame. %0a%0aCHAP. 25. (7.) — CARBUNCULUS : TWELVE VARIETIE8 OF IT. %0a%0aIn the first rank among these is carbunculus, 89 so called from %0aits resemblance to fire ; though in reality it is proof against the %0aaction of that element : 90 hence it is that some persons call %0athese stones "acaustoi." 91 There are various kinds of carbun- %0aculus, the Indian and the Garam antic, for example, which last %0ahas been also called the Carchedonian, 92 in compliment to the %0aformer opulence of Great Carthage. 93 To these are added the %0a^Ethiopian and the Alabandic stones, the latter of which are %0afound at Orthosia 94 in Caria, but are cut and polished at Ala- %0abanda. 93 In addition to this, each kind is subdivided into the %0amale carbunculus and the female, the former of which is of a %0a%0a87 " Carnosas." It is somewhat doubtful whether our Carnelian, or %0aCornelian, take its name from this word, or from "cornus," a cornel-berry. %0a%0a83 See Chapter 31. %0a%0a89 Literally meaning a " red-hot coal." The carbunculus of Pliny is %0asupposed to include not only the red, or Iron and Iron-lime garnet, but %0athe Spinelle ruby also, or Oriental ruby. %0a%0a90 There is some truth in this, as some few kinds both of the Garnet and %0aRuby are infusible. Of the ruby, the red varieties change to brown, black, %0aand opaque even, as the temperature increases, and on cooling become first %0agreen, and then nearly colourless, but at last resume their red colour. %0a%0a91 From the Greek; meaning " incombustible." %0a%0a92 From Kapx^w , the Greek name for Carthage. %0a%0a93 Carthago Magna, so called in contradistinction to Carthage Nova, or %0aNew Carthage, in Spain. 9 * See B. v. c. 29. %0a%0a95 In the vicinity of Orthosia. It is from this place that one kind of %0agarnet is now called " Almandine." There is also the Almandiue, or %0aviolet-coloured ruby. See Beckmann, Hist. Inv. Vol. II. p. 238. Bohris %0aEdition. It is probable that Carthage was the great entrepot for the car- %0abunculi of the Garamantes and JStbiopia, where Red sapphire, Red corun- %0adum, or Oriental ruby, was probably found. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 25.] %0a%0a%0a%0aCABBUNCULUS. %0a%0a%0a%0a421 %0a%0a%0a%0amore striking brilliancy, the brightness of the latter being not %0aso strong. In the male varieties too, we see some in which %0athe fire is clearer than in others ; while some, again, are of a %0adarker 96 hue, or else have their brilliancy more deeply seated, %0aand shine with a more powerful lustre than others when viewed %0ain the sun. %0a%0aThe most highly esteemed, however, is the amethyst- %0acoloured 97 stone, the fire at the extremity of which closely %0aapproaches the violet tint of amethystos : next in value to %0awhich, are the stones known as " syrtites," radiant with a %0awavy, feathery, 98 refulgenee. They are found more particu- %0alarly, it is said, where the reflection is most powerful of the %0arays of the sun. Satyrus says that the carbunculus 98 * of India %0ahas no lustre, that it is mostly soiled, and that in all cases its %0abrilliancy is of a tawny complexion. The ^Ethiopian stones, %0ahe says, are dense, emit no lustre, and burn with a concentrated %0aflame. According to Callistratus, the refulgence of this stone %0ashould be of a whitish hue, and, when placed upon a table, it %0ashould heighten by its lustre other stones placed near it that %0aare clouded at the edge. Hence it is, that many writers speak %0aof this stone as the white carbunculus, while the Indian stone, %0awith its comparatively feeble lustre, is known by the name of %0a" lignyzon." 99 The Carchedonian stones, they say, are of much %0asmaller size than the others ; but those of India admit of being %0ahollowed out, and making vessels that will hold as much as %0aone sextarius 1 even. %0a%0aAccording to Archelaus, the Carchedonian carbunculus is of %0aa more swarthy appearance than the others, but, when exposed %0ato the light of the fire or sun, and viewed obliquely, the bril- %0aliancy of it is much more intense than that of the rest. He says, %0atoo, that this stone, when overshadowed by a roof, has a purple %0atint ; that when viewed in the open air, it is of a flame colour ; %0a%0a94 A variety, perhaps, of Iron garnet, or Iron-lime garnet. %0a%0a97 Desfontaines suggests that this may have been the Balas ruby, or %0apossibly the Syrian Garnet, of a violet purple colour. Not improbably it %0ais the Almandine ruby. %0a%0a98 " Pinnato fulgore." This mottled appearance is to be seen in the %0ainterior of some red garnets. 9b * Common garnets, probably. %0a%0a99 Sillig suggests that this may be from Xtyvig, " soot." The reading, %0ahowever, is extremely doubtful. %0a%0a1 See Introduction to Vol. III. If this is the truth, they were made of %0asome of the crystals of the garnet, probably. %0a%0a%0a%0a422 %0a%0a%0a%0aplint's natural history.

Many authors have asserted that the %0aIndian stones are paler than the Carchedonian, and that, quite %0athe converse of these last, they are all the less brilliant when %0aviewed obliquely; as also, that in the male Carchedonian stone %0athere are luminous points like stars within, while, in the case %0aof the female stone, the whole of its refulgence is thrown be- %0ayond it. The stones of Alabanda too, it is said, are darker than %0athe other kinds, and rough on the surface. In the vicinity %0aalso of Miletus, there are stones of this description found in the %0aearth, resembling those of Alabanda in colour, and proof against %0athe action of fire. %0a%0aAccording to Theophrastus, 2 these stones are to be found also %0aat Orchomenus in Arcadia and in the Isle of Chios ; 3 the former 4 %0aof which are of a darker hue, and are used for making mirrors. %0aHe says too, that at Trcezen they are found of various colours %0aand mottled with white spots, those found at Corinth being %0aof a more pallid, whitish, hue. He states also, that they are %0asometimes imported from Massilia. Bocchus informs us in his %0awritings, that these stones are extracted from the ground at %0aOlisipo ; 5 at the cost of great labour, however, in consequence %0aof the parched, argillaceous, nature of the soil. %0a%0aCHAP. 26. DEFECTS IN CARBUNCUXUS, AND THE MODE OF %0a%0aTESTING IT. %0a%0aNothing is more difficult than to distinguish the several %0avarieties of this stone, so great an opportunity do they afford %0ato artistic skill of compelling them to reflect the colours of %0asubstances placed beneath. It is possible, they say, to heighten %0athe brilliancy of dull stones, by steeping them for fourteen %0adays in vinegar, this adventitious lustre being retained by them %0a%0a2 De Lapid. sec 61. %0a%0a3 " Pliny has here committed a gross mistake, which has not been ob- %0aserved by Hardouin. Theophrastus, in the passage alluded to, does not %0aspeak of a ruby, but the well-known black marble of Chio ; though he %0acalls both carbunculus, a name given to the ruby, on account of its likeness %0ato a burning coal, and to the black marble on account of its resemblance %0ato a quenched coal or cinder; and the latter, as well as the Obsidian stone, %0awas sometimes used for mirrors." — Beckmann, Hist.

They are counterfeited, too, with great exact- %0aness in glass ; but the difference may be detected with the %0atouchstone ; the same being the case also with other artificial %0astones, as the material is always of a softer nature and com- %0aparatively brittle. When thus tested by the stone, hard knots, %0atoo, are detected in them ; and the weight of the glass counter- %0afeit is always less. In some cases, too, they present small blisters %0awithin, which shine like silver. %0a%0aCHAP. 27. ANTHEACIT1S. %0a%0aThere is also a fossil stone found in Thesprotia, known as %0a" anthracitis," 7 and resembling a burning coaP in appearance. %0aThose who have stated that it is a native also of Liguria, are %0amistaken, in my opinion, unless perhaps it was to be found %0athere in their time. Some of these stones, they say, are sur- %0arounded with a vein of white. Like those which we have %0amentioned above, they have a fiery colour, but there is this %0apeculiarity in them, that when thrown into the fire they have all %0athe appearance of becoming quenched and deadened ; while, on %0athe other hand, if they are drenched with water, they become %0adoubly glowing. 9 %0a%0aCHAP. 28. SANDASTEOS. SANDABESOS. %0a%0aOf a kindred nature, too, is sandastros, 10 known as "gar- %0aamantites" by some : it is found in India, at a place of that %0aname, and is a product also of the southern parts of Arabia. %0aThe great recommendation of it is, that it has all the appearance %0aof fire placed behind a transparent substance, it burning with %0astar-like scintillations within, that resemble drops of gold, and %0a%0a6 Dalechamps thinks that this is the same as the " anthracites " men- %0ationed in B. xxxvi. c. 38, and identifies it either with our Anthracite, or %0aelse with pit-coal or bituminous coal. It is much more likely, however, %0athat a precious stone is meant; and, in conformity with this opinion, Brotero %0aand Ajasson have identified it with the Spinelle or scarlet Ruby, and the %0aBalas or rose-red ruby, magnesiates of alumina. 7 See B. iv. c. 1. %0a%0a* "Carbo." This word may mean either a "burning coal" or "char- %0acoal," hence the confusion that has arisen in identifying the mineral %0asubstance that is meant. 8 See Note 90, to Chapter 25. %0a%0aio »' Sandaresus " and "Sandasiros" are other readings. This stone %0ahas not been identified, but Ajasson is inclined to think that it may have %0abeen Aventurine quartz, and is the more inclined to this opinion, as that %0amineral is found in Persia, and sandastra or tchandastra is purely a San- %0ascrit word. The description, however, would hardly seem to apply to %0aAventurine. %0a%0a%0a%0a424 %0a%0a%0a%0aPLINY'S NATURAL HI8T0RT. %0a%0a%0a%0a[Hook xxxvii. %0a%0a%0a%0aare always to be seen in the body of the stone, and never upon %0athe surface. There are certain religious associations, too, con- %0anected with this stone, in consequence of the affinity which it %0ais supposed to bear with the stars ; these scintillations being %0amostly, In number and arrangement, like the constellations of %0athe Pleiades and Hyades ; a circumstance which had led to the %0ause of it by the Chaldaei in the ceremonials which they practise. %0a%0aHere, too, the male stones are distinguished from the female, %0aby their comparative depth of colour and the vigorousness of %0athe tints which they impart to objects near them : indeed the %0astones of -India, it is said, quite dim the sight by their brilliancy. %0aThe flame of the female sandastros is of a more softened nature, %0aand maybe pronounced to be lustrous rather than brilliant. %0aSome prefer the stone of Arabia to that of India, and say that %0athis last bears a considerable resemblance to a smoke-coloured %0achrysolithos. Ismenias asserts that sandastros, in consequence %0aof its extreme softness, will not admit of being polished, a %0acircumstance which makes it sell all 11 the dearer : other writers, %0aagain, call these stones " sandrisitse." One point upon which %0aall the authorities are agreed is, that the greater the number %0aof stars upon the stone, the more costly it is in price. %0a%0aThe similarity of the name has sometimes caused this stone to be %0aconfounded with that known as "sandaresos," and which Nican- %0ader calls "sandaserion," and others "sandaseron." Some, again, %0acall this last-mentioned stone " sandastros," and the former one %0a" sandaresos." The stone 12 that is thus mentioned by Nicander, %0ais a native of India as well as the other, and likewise takes %0aits name from the locality where it is found. The colour of %0ait is that of an apple, or of green oil, and no one sets any %0avalue on it. %0a%0aCHAP. 29.

Brotero is of opinion %0athat this is the Cherry-coloured ruby, that the Ionian stone is the Purple %0aruby, and that the kermes-berry coloured stone is the Scarlet or Spinelle %0aruby. From the distinct reference made to its electric nature, Ajasson %0aidentifies it with Tourmaline, a Silicate of alumina. Beckmann is of the %0asame opinion ; Hist. Inv. Vol. I. p. 88.

It is found in the vicinity of %0aOrthosia, throughout the whole of Caria, and in the neighbour- %0aing localities ; but the most approved stones are those that %0acome from India. Some writers have given the name of " dead- %0aened" 14 carbunculus to a lychnis of second-rate quality, and %0asimilar in colour to the flower known as the " flower of Jove." ,s %0aI find other varieties also mentioned, one with a purple radiance, %0aand another of a scarlet 1 " tint.

When %0acertain quarries are being worked, these stones are found, %0aadhering, like a kind of heart, to the interior of the rock. This %0amineral, however, is said to be now extinct in Persia ; though %0ait is to be found in numerous other localities, Paros and Assos, %0afor example. %0a%0aIn India 22 there are three varieties of this stone ; the red %0asarda, the one known as "pionia," from its thickness, and a third %0akind, beneath which they place a ground of silver tinsel. The %0aIndian stones are transparent, those of Arabia being more %0aopaque. There are some found also in the vicinity of Leucas %0ain Epirus, and in Egypt, which have a ground placed beneath %0athem of leaf gold. In the case of this stone, too, the male %0astone shines with a more attractive brilliancy than the female, %0awhich is of a thicker substance, and more opaque. Among the %0aancients there was no precious stone in more common use than %0athis ; at all events, it is this stone that is made so much parade %0aof in the comedies of Menander and Philemon. No one, too, %0aamong the transparent stones is tarnished more speedily by ex- %0aposure to moisture than this ; though of all liquids, it is oil %0athat acts the most readily upon it.

(8.) — topazos: TWO varieties of it. %0a%0aTopazos 24 is a stone that is still held in very high estimation %0afor its green tints : indeed, when it was first discovered, it was %0apreferred to every other kind of precious stone. It so happened %0athat some Troglodytic pirates, suffering from tempest and %0ahunger, having landed upon an island off the coast of Arabia %0aknown as Cytis, 25 when digging there for roots and grasn, %0adiscovered this precious stone : such, at least, is the opinion %0a%0ared, which afterwards turns to a rich, deep, red, on exposure to the sun's %0arays, and subsequently to artificial heat. %0a%0a22 Which supplies the best carnelians at the present day. %0a%0a23 From their mixture, Ajasson says, with argillaceous earth. %0a%0a24 Under this name Pliny evidently speaks of the stone known to us as %0aChrysolite, and possibly of green agate as well.

Juba says that there is an island in the %0aRed Sea called " Topazos," 26 at a distance of three hundred %0astadia from the main laud ; that it is surrounded by fogs, and %0ais often sought by navigators in consequence ; and that, owing %0ato this, it received its present name, 27 the word "topazin" %0ameaning " to seek," in the language of the Troglodytae. He %0astates also, that Philon, the king's praefect, was the first to bring %0athese stones from this island ; that, on his presenting them to %0aQueen Berenice, the mother of the second Ptolemaeus, she was %0awonderfully pleased with them ; and that, at a later period, a %0astatue, four cubits in height, was made of this stone,- 8 iu honour %0aof Arsinoe, the wife of Ptolemaeus Philadelphus, it being con- %0asecrated in the temple known as the " Golden Temple." %0a%0aThe most recent writers say that this stone is found also in %0athe vicinity of Alabastrum, a city of Thebais, and they dis- %0atinguish two varieties of it, the prasoides 29 and the chrysop- %0ateron ; 30 which last is similar to chrysoprasu8, 3, all the shades of it %0atending, more or less, to resemble the colouring principle of %0athe leek. Topazos is the largest of all the precious stones, %0aand is the only one among those of high value that yields to %0athe action of the file, the rest being polished by the aid of %0astone of Naxos. 32 It admits, too, of being worn by use. %0a%0aCHAP. 33.

In both %0acases, however, it is only amid frozen and inaccessible rocks that %0ait is found, protruding from the surface, like an eye in appear- %0aance, and slightly adhering to the rock ; not as though it formed %0aan integral part of it, but with all the appearance of having %0abeen attached to it. People so habituated as they are to riding %0aon horseback, cannot find the energy and dexterity requisite %0afor climbing the rocks to obtain the stones, while, at the same %0atime, they are quite terrified at the danger of doing so. Hence %0ait is, that they attack the stones with slings from a distance, %0aand so bring them down, moss and all. It is with this stone %0athat the people pay their tribute, and this the rich look upon %0aas their most graceful ornament for the neck. 35 This constitutes %0athe whole of their wealth, with some, and it is their chief %0aglory to recount how many of these stones they have brought %0adown from the mountain heights since the days of their child- %0ahood. Their success, however, is extremely variable; 36 for while %0asome, at the very first throw, have brought down remarkably %0afine specimens, many have arrived at old age without obtaining %0aany. %0a%0aSuch is the method of procuring these stones ; their form %0abeing given them by cutting, a thing that is easily effected. %0aThe best of them have just the colour of smaragdus, a thing %0athat proves that the most pleasing property in them is one that %0abelongs of right to another stone.

In appearance it resembles a smoke-coloured topazos, or, %0ain some cases, a topazos with a tint like honey.

DEFECTS FOUND %0aIN IASPIS. %0a%0aIaspis, 48 too, is green, and often transparent ; a stone which, if %0asurpassed hy many others, still retains the renown which it %0aacquired in former times. Many countries produce this stone : %0athat of India is like smaragdus in colour ; that of Cyprus 13 %0ahard, and of a full sea-green ; and that of Persia is sky-blue, %0awhence its name, " aerizusa." 47 Similar to this last is the %0aCaspian iaspis. On the banks of the river Thermodon the %0aiaspis is of an azure colour ; in Phrygia, it is purple ; and m %0aCappadocia of an azure purple, sombre, and not refulgent. %0aAmisos 48 sends us an iaspis like that of India in colour, and %0aChalcedon, 49 a stone of a turbid hue. %0a%0aBut it is of less consequence to distinguish the several loca- %0alities that furnish it, than it is to remark upon the degrees of %0aexcellence which they present. The best kind is that which %0ahas a shade of purple, the next best being the rose-coloured, %0aand the next the stone with the green colour of the smaragdus ; %0ato each of which the Greeks have given names 50 according to %0atheir respective tints. A fourth kind, which is called by them %0a" boria," 51 resembles in colour the sky of a morning in autumn ; %0athis, too, will be the same that is known as " aerizusa."" There %0ais an iaspis also which resembles sarda 53 in appearance, and %0aanother with a violet tint. Not less numerous, too, are the %0aother kinds that are left undescribed ; but they are all blue to %0aa fault, 54 or else resemble crystal in appearance, or the tints of %0athe myxa 55 plum. There is the terebenthine^-coloured iaspis %0aalso ; improperly so called, in my opinion, as it has all the ap- %0apearance of being a composition of numerous gems of this de- %0ascription. %0a%0aThe best of these stones are set in an open bezel, the gold of %0a%0a46 Meadow-green jasper %0a%0a47 Salmasius erroneously takes this to be the Turquoise.

One great defect in %0athem is a subdued lustre, and a want of refulgence when %0aviewed from a distance. Grains also like salt appear within the %0astone, and all the other defects which are common 67 to precious %0astones in general. Sometimes they are imitated in glass ; a fraud, %0ahowever, which may be easily detected, from the material %0athrowing out its refulgence, instead of concentrating it within %0aitself. To this class also belongs the stone called " Bphragis," 48 %0awhich is only reckoned as belonging to the domain of precious %0astones, from the circumstance that it is the best of all for %0amaking signets. 69 %0a%0a(9.) Throughout all the East, it is the custom, it is said, to %0awear iaspis by way of amulet. The variety of this stone %0awhich resembles smaragdus in colour is often found with a %0awhite line running transversely through the middle ; in which %0acase it is known as " monogrammos i" 60 when it is streaked %0awith several lines, it is called " polygrammos." 61 Here, too, I %0amay take the opportunity of exposing the falsehoods 62 of the %0amagicians, who pretend that this stone is beneficial for persons %0awhen speaking in public. There is a stone also that is formed of %0aiaspis and onyx combined, and is known as " iasponyx." 63 Some- %0atimes this stone has a clouded appearance ; sometimes it has %0aspots upon the surface like snow ; 64 and sometimes it is stel- %0alated with red spots. 68 One kind resembles salt of Megara 66 in %0aappearance, and another is known as capnias, 67 and looks as if %0ait had been smoked.

The best kind is that of %0aScythia, 70 the next best being the produce of Cyprus, and, last %0aof all, that of Egypt. An artificial 11 kind is much in use, %0athat is prepared by dyeing other substances ; and this inven- %0ation is looked upon as one of the great glories of the kings %0aof Egypt, the name of the king who first discovered it being %0astill preserved in their annals.

In no %0acase, however, is this stone diaphanous; in addition to which, %0ait is not suited for engraving when intersected with hard par- %0aticles of a crystalline 74 nature.

Beckmann is of opinion that it was a mineral or moun- %0atain blue, tinged with copper. %0a%0a,0 It is found in China, Persia, Siberia, and Bucharia. %0a%0a71 Ultramarine is prepared from Lapis lazuli, and an artificial kind is %0aextensively in use, which equals the native in permanency and brilliancy %0aof colour, and is very extensively employed in the arts. Theophrastus, %0aDe Lapid. sec. 55, speaks of this artificial ultramarine. %0a%0a7,2 This must not be taken for the Sapphire of the present day, but was %0amost probably Lapis lazuli, and identical, perhaps, with Cyanos.

The name which these stones bear, %0aoriginates, it is said, in the peculiar tint of their brilliancy' %0awhich, after closely approaching the colour of wine, passes off %0ainto a violet without being fully pronounced : or else, accord- %0aing to some authorities, in the fact that in their purple there %0ais something that falls short of a fiery colour, the tints fading %0aofi° and inclining to the colour of wine. %0a%0aAll these stones are transparent and of an agreeable violet %0acolour, and are easy 79 to engrave. Those of India have in %0aperfection the very richest shades of purple, and it is to attain %0athis colour that the dyers 77 in purple direct all their endeavours ; %0ait presenting a fine mellowed appearance to the eye, and not %0adazzling the sight, as in the case with the colours of the carbun- %0acultis. Another variety approaches more nearly the hyacinth %0ain colour : the people of India call this tint "socon," and the %0astone itself " socondion." A third stone of this class is of a %0amore diluted colour, and is known as " sapenos," being iden- %0atical with "pharanitis," so called from a country 7 * on the %0afrontiers of Arabia that produces it. Of a fourth kind, the %0acolour is like that of wine ; and in a fifth it borders very closely %0aupon that of crystal, the purple gradually passing off into %0awhite. This last kind is but little valued ; for a fine amethyst %0ashould always have, when viewed sideways 79 and held up to the %0alight, a certain purple refulgence, like that of carbunculus, %0aslightly inclining to a tint of rose. %0a%0aSome prefer giving these stones the name of "psederos" 80 or %0a%0a75 So called, according to some authorities, from r%3c, "not," yuQvu, "to %0aintoxicate," on account of its being a supposed preservative against inebriety. %0a-Ajasson is of opinion that l'liny does not here speaks of the Quartz Ame- %0athyst of modern mineralogy, but only the Oriental Amethyst, violet Sap- %0aphire, or violet Corundum. It is not improbable, however, that he includes %0athem all, as well as violet Fluor spar, and some other purple stones; inclusive, %0apossibly, of the Garnet. %0a%0a76 He is probably speaking here of violet Fluor spar; Oriental amethyst, %0aor violet sapphire, it is next to impossible to engrave. 77 SeeB. ix. c. 62. %0a%0aThe city of Pharan, mentioned by St. Jerome and Eusebius. %0a79 " In suspectu."

We have already seen, in Chapter 32, that the "To- %0apazos" of the ancients was in all probability the modern Chrysolite. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 44 ] %0a%0a%0a%0aLEUC0CHETS03. %0a%0a%0a%0a435 %0a%0a%0a%0aalso, a transparent stone with a 'refulgence like that of gold. %0aThe stones of India are the most highly esteemed, as also those %0afound among the Tibareni, 88 provided these last are not of a %0amottled hue. The worst in quality are those of Arabia, the %0acolour of them being turbid and mottled, and their brilliancy %0ainterrupted by cloudy spots : even too, when they happen to %0abe limpid, they have all the appearance of being full, as it %0awere, of a peculiar dust. The best stones are those which, %0awhen placed by the side of gold, impart to it a sort of whitish %0ahue, and so give it the appearance of silver. When this is the %0acase, they are set in a bezel that is open on either side ; but %0awhen the stone is of inferior quality, a ground of aurichalcum 89 %0ais placed beneath. %0a%0aCHAP. 43. — CHRYSELECTRUM. %0a%0aThough it has now altogether gone out of use for jewellery, %0athere is a precious stone known as "chryselectrum," 90 the colour %0aof which inclines to that of amber; 91 but only when viewed by %0aa morning 92 light. The stones of Pontus are known by their %0alightness. Some of them are hard and reddish, while others, %0aagain, are soft and of a soiled appearance. According to Bocohus, %0athese stones are found in Spain as well; in a spot where, %0aaccording to him, fossil crystal has been discovered, in sinking %0ato the water-level for wells. 93 He tells us also that he once %0asaw a chrysolithos twelve 94 pounds in weight. %0a%0aCHAP. 44. LETJCOCHRYSOS : FOUR VARIETIES OF IT. %0a%0aThere is also a stone known as " leucochrysos," 95 with a %0awhite vein running across it. To this class, too, belongs cap- %0anias ; M a stone also which resembles glass in appearance ; and %0aanother which reflects a tint like that of saffron. These stones %0aare imitated in glass, to such a degree of perfection, that it is %0aimpossible to distinguish them by the eye. The touch, how- %0aeve , detects the difference, the imitation being not so cold as %0atbe real stone. %0a%0af * In Pontus : see B. vi. c. 4. 89 See B. xxxiv. c. 2. %0a%0a90 Supposed to be yellow- white Hyacinth.

MKLICUKYSOS. XUTHON. %0a%0aTo this class also belongs melichrysos, 91 a stone which has %0aall the appearance of pure honey, seen through transparent %0agold. India produces these stones, and, although hard, they %0aare very brittle, but not unpleasing to the sight. The same %0acountry, too, produces xuthon, 98 a stone much used by the lower %0aclasses there. %0a%0aCHAP. 46. TiEDEROS, SANGKNON, OR TENITES. %0a%0aAt the very head of the white stones is psederos though %0ait may still be questionable to which of the colours it in %0areality belongs. As to the name, it has been so much bandied %0aabout among other precious stones of conspicuous beauty, that %0ait has quite assumed the privilege of being a synonymous %0aterm 1 for all that is charming to the eye. Still, however, there %0ais one 2 stone in particular which fully merits all the commenda- %0ation that might be expected for a stone with so prepossessing %0aa name : for in itself it reunites the transparency of crystal, %0athe peculiar green of the sky, the deep tints of purple, %0aand a sort of bright reflex, like that of a golden-coloured %0awine ; a reflex, indeed, that is always the last to meet %0athe eye, but is always crowned with the lustrous hues of %0apurple. The stone, in fact, has all the appearance of having %0abeen bathed in each of these tints, individually, and yet in the %0awhole of them at once. There is no precious stone either that %0ahas a clearer water than this, or that presents a more pleasing %0asweetness to the eye. %0a%0aPsederos of the finest quality comes from India, where it is %0aknown as " sangeuon ;" the next best being that of Egypt, %0acalled " tenites." That of third-rate quality is found in Arabia, %0abut it is rough upon the surface. Next, we have the stone of %0aPontus, the radiance of which is softer than in that of Thasos, %0awhich, in its turn, is of a more mellowed colour than the %0astones of Galatia, Thrace, and Cyprus. The defects com- %0a%0a97 " Honey gold stone." Some are of opinion that this was the Honey- %0acoloured Hyacinth. Others, again, identify it with the yellow, honey- %0acoloured Topaz ; an opinion with which Ajasson coincides. %0a%0a98 " Xanthon " is another reading. See Chapter 60 of this Book. %0a%0a99 " Lovely youth." See Chapter 22, where it has been already men- %0ationed. He here reverts to the Opals. %0a%0a1 See Chapter 40, for example, where it is given to a variety of the %0aAmethyst. 2 The Opal, which he is about to describe. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 49.] %0a%0a%0a%0aASTUIOTES. %0a%0a%0a%0a437 %0a%0a%0a%0amonly found in these stones are, a want of brilliancy, a confusion %0awith colours which do not properly belong to them, and the %0aother imperfections which are found in stones in general. 3 %0a%0aCHAP. 47. ASTEEIA. %0a%0aNext among the white stones is " asteria," 1 a gem which %0aholds its high rank on account of a certain peculiarity in its %0anature, it having a light enclosed within, in the pupil of an %0aeye as it were. This light, which has all the appearance of %0amoving within the stone, it transmits according to the angle of %0ainclination at which it is held ; now in one direction, and %0anow in another. "When held facing the sun, it emits white %0arays like those of a star, and to this, in fact, it owes its name. 6 %0aThe stones of India are very difficult to engrave, those of Car- %0amania being preferred. %0a%0aCHAP. 48. ASTRION. %0a%0aOf a similar white radiance is the stone that is known as %0a"astrion," 6 closely resembling crystal in its nature, and found %0ain India and upon the coasts of Pallene. 7 In the centre of it %0athere shines internally a brilliant star, with a refulgence like %0athat of the moon when full. Some will have it that this stone %0areceives its name from the fact that, when held opposite to the %0astars, it absorbs the light they emit and then returns it. The %0afinest stones, they say, are those of Carmania, there being %0anone more entirely free from all defects. They add, also, that %0aa stone of inferior quality is known as " ceraunia,'' 8 and that, %0ain the worst of all, the light is very similar to that given by a %0alamp. %0a%0aCHAP. 49. ASTUIOTES. %0a%0aAstriotes, 9 too, is a stone that is highly esteemed, and Zoro- %0aaster, they say, has sung its wondrous praises as an adjunct of %0athe magic art. %0a%0a3 See Chapter 18 of this Book. %0a%0a4 The vitreous Asteriated crystals of Sapphire are still called by this %0aname. Ajasson, however, and Desfontaines, identify this gem with Gir- %0aasol opal or fire opal. See Note 60. 5 From danp, a star. %0a%0a8 «« Star-stone." Ajasson identifies this stone with the Asteriated Sap- %0aphire or Corundum, mentioned in Note 4 above. %0a%0a7 See B. iv. cc. 10, 17. 8 " Lightning darting." %0a%0a9 " Star-like." Ajasson thinks, that it is identical with the stone next %0amentioned. %0a%0a%0a%0a438 %0a%0a%0a%0aPLINY'S NATURAL HISTORY. [Book XXXVII. %0a%0a%0a%0aCHAP. 50. ASTR0B0L0S. %0a%0aSudines says, that astrobolos 10 resembles the eye of a fish in %0aappearance, and that it has a radiant white refulgence when %0aviewed in the sun. %0a%0aCHAP. 51. CERAUNIA ; FOUR "VARIETIES OF IT. %0a%0aAmong the white stones also, there is one known as %0a" ceraunia," 11 which absorbs the brilliancy of the stars. It is %0aof a crystalline formation, of a lustrous azure colour, and is a %0anative of Carmania. Zenothemis admits that it is white, but %0aasserts that it has the figure of a blazing star within. Some of %0athem, he says, are dull, in which case it is the custom to steep %0athem for some days in a mixture of nitre and vinegar ; at the %0aend of which period the star makes its appearance, but gradu- %0aally dies away by the end of as many months. %0a%0aSotacus mentions also two other varieties of ceraunia, one %0ablack and the other red ; and he says that they resemble axes %0ain shape. Those which are black and round, 12 he says, are %0alooked upon as sacred, and by their assistance cities and fleets %0aare attacked and taken : the name given to them is " bsetyli," %0athose of an elongated form being known as " ceraunise." 13 They %0amake out also that there is another kind, rarely to be met with, %0aand much in request for the practices of magic, it never being %0afound in any place but one that has been struck by lightning. 11 %0a%0aCHAP. 52. — IRIS ; TWO VARIETIES OF IT. %0a%0aThe next name mentioned by these authors is that of the %0astone called " iris;" 15 which is found, in a fossil state, in a %0acertain island of the Eed Sea, forty miles distant from the city %0a%0a10 " Planet-stricken." It is not improbable tbat tbis was Cafs-eye, a %0atranslucent Chalcedony, presenting a peculiar opalescence, or internal re- %0aflections, when cut en cabochon. The colour is either bright-greenish grey, %0aor else yellow, red, or brownish. %0a%0a11 See Note 8 above. Parisot thinks that these must have been %0aAerolites or Meteorites. %0a%0a12 Brotero thinks that these were petrified shells, to which the magicians %0aimputed marvellous properties. %0a%0a13 Brotero is of opinion that those were Belemnites, more commonly %0aknown as "thunderstones." The reading "baetyli " is doubtful ; but Par- %0aisot says, on what authority does not appear, that " Betylus " meant " Great %0afather," and that this name, as well as " Abaddir " of similar significa- %0ation, was given by magicians to aerolites or meteorites used in their en- %0ashantments. 14 A meteoric stone or aerolite, evidently. %0a%0a15 " Rainbow."

It is partly composed of crystal, and hence it is %0athat some have called it " root of crystal/' It takes its name %0a"iris" from the properties which it possesses; for, when %0astruck by the rays of the sun in a covered spot, it projects upon %0athe nearest walls the form and diversified colours of the rain- %0abow ; continually changing its tints, and exciting admiration %0aby the great variety of colours which it presents. That it is %0ahexahedral in form, like crystal, is generally agreed; but some %0asay that it is rough on the sides and of unequal angles ; %0aand that, when exposed to a full sun, it disperses the rays %0athat are thrown upon it, while at the same time, by throw- %0aing out a certain brightness 16 before it, it illumines all ob- %0ajects that may happen to be adjacent. The stone, however, %0aas already stated, only presents these colours when under %0acover ; not as though they were in the body of the stone %0aitself, but, to all appearance, as if they were the result of the %0areflected light upon the surface of the wall. The best kind is %0athe one that produces the largest arcs, with the closest resem- %0ablance to the rainbow. %0a%0a" Iritis " is the name of another stone, similar to the last in %0aall other respects, but remarkable for its extreme hardness. %0aHorus says, in his writings, that this stone, calcined and tritu- %0arated, is a remedy for the bite of the ichneumon, and that it is %0aa native of Persia. %0a%0achap. 53. — LEROS. %0aThe stone called "leros" 17 is similar in appearance, but does %0anot produce the same effects.

[Book XXXVII. %0a%0a%0a%0aaccording to their respective colours, I shall proceed to mention %0athe rest of them in their alphabetical order. %0a%0a(10.) Achates 18 was a stone formerly in high esteem, but %0anow held in none. It was first found in Sicily, near a river %0aof that name ; but has since been discovered in numerous other %0alocalities. In size it exceeds any other stones of this class, %0aand the varieties of it are numerous, the name varying accord- %0aingly. Thus, for example, we have iaspachates, 1 ' cerachates, 20 %0asmaragdachates, 21 haemachates, 22 leucaehates, 23 dendrachates, 21 %0amarked with small shrubs, as it were ; autachates, 25 which when %0aburnt has a smell like that of myrrh ; and coralloachates,* %0aspotted all over, like sapphiros, with drops of gold, and com- %0amonly found in Crete, where it is also known as " sacred" %0aachates. This last, it is thought, is good for wounds inflicted %0aby spiders and scorpions ; a property which I could really %0abelieve to belong to the stones of Sicily, for, the moment they %0abreathe the air of that province, scorpions lose their venom. %0a%0aThe stones, too, that are found in India are possessed of %0asimilar properties, and of other great and marvellous properties %0aas well ; for they present the appearance in them of rivers, 27 %0awoods, 28 beasts of burden, and forms even, like ivy 29 and the %0atrappings of horses. Medical men, too, make grinding-hones 30 %0aof these stones, and indeed the very sight of them is beneficial %0afor the eyes : held in the mouth, they allay thirst. Those %0afound in Phrygia have no green in them, and those of Thebes %0ain Egypt are destitute of red and white veins. These last are %0agood as a counterpoison to the venom of the scorpion, and the %0astones of Cyprus are held in similar repute. Some persons set %0athe highest value upon those stones which present a trans- %0aparency like that of glass. They are found also in Trachiuia, %0a%0a18 A general name for Agate, and possibly some other stones not now %0aincluded under the name. 19 "Jasper agate." %0a%0a20 "Wax agate."

To be duly efficacious, they must be attached to the %0abody with hairs from a lion's mane. The hair, however, of %0athe hyaena is held in abomination for this purpose, as being a %0apromoter of discord in families. The stone that is of an uni- %0aform colour renders athletes invincible, they say : the way of %0atesting it is to throw it, along with colouring matter, into a %0apot full of oil ; after being kept for a couple of hours gently on %0athe boil, if genuine, it will impart an uniform colour of vermilion %0ato the mixture. %0a%0aAcopos 31 is a stone like nitre 33 in appearance, porous, and %0astarred with drops of gold : gently boiled with oil and applied %0aas an unguent, it relieves lassitude, if we choose to believe it. %0aAlabastritis 33 is a stone which comes from Alabastron m %0aEgypt and Damascus in Syria : it is of a white colour, spotted %0awith various other tints. Calcined with fossil salt and pulver- %0aized, it is a cure for affections of the mouth and teeth, it is %0asuid Alectoria 34 is the name given to a stone that is found in %0athe 'crop of poultry, like crystal in appearance, and about as %0alarge as a bean in size : Milo 35 of Crotona, some will have it, %0awas thought to be in the habit of carrying this stone about %0ahim a thing that rendered him invincible in his athletic con- %0atests. Androdamas 36 has the shining colour of silver like %0aadamas f it is always quadrangular, like small cubes in shape. %0aThe magicians are of opinion that it was thus named from the %0afact that it subdues anger and violence in man. Whether %0aargyrodamas 38 is the same stone or not, authors do not inform %0a%0aai « Refreshing" stone.

Antipathes 39 is a black stone, and not transparent : the mode %0aof testing it, is by boiling it in milk, to which, if genuine, it %0aimparts a colour like that of myrrh. A person might probably %0aexpect to find some extraordinary virtues in this stone, seeing %0athat, among so many other substances possessed of antipathetic %0aproperties, it is the only one that bears this name. The ma- %0agicians will have it that it possesses the power of counter- %0aacting fascinations. %0a%0aArabica 40 is a stone which closely resembles ivory in ap- %0apearance, and, indeed, might easily be taken for it, were it not %0afor its superior hardness : persons who have this stone about %0athem, it is thought, will experience a cure of diseases of the %0asinews. Aromatitis, 41 too, is a stone that is found in Arabia, as %0aalso in the vicinity of Phirae in Egypt : it is always full of %0asmall stones, and like myrrh in colour and smell, a thing that %0amakes it much in request with ladies of rank. 42 Asbestos 43 %0ais found in the mountains of Arcadia, and is of an iron %0acolour. Democritus informs us that aspisatis 44 is a native %0aof Arabia, that it is of a fiery colour, and that patients %0ashould wear it attached to the body with camels' dung; he %0asays, too, that it is found in the nests of certain birds 45 in %0aArabia. The same writer also mentions another stone of this %0aname, that is found at Leucopetra in the same country, of a %0asilver colour, radiant, and an excellent preservative against %0adelirium. In India, he says, and on Mount Acidane in %0aPersia, there is a stone found that is known as " atizoe," 46 of a %0asilver lustre, three fingers in length, like a lentil in shape, %0apossessed of a pleasant smell, and considered necessary by the %0aMagi at the consecration of a king. Augetis 47 is thought by %0amany to be identical with callaina. 48 Amphidanes, 49 which is %0aalso known as " chrysocolla," 50 is a stone found in that part of %0aIndia where the ants 61 throw up gold, and in it there are certain %0a%0a39 " Counteracting-stone." %0a%0a40 Probably the stone mentioned in B. xxxvi. c. 41. %0a%0a41 *' Aromatic stone."

Cappadocia 71 is a native of %0aPhrygia, and resembles ivory in appearance. Callaica 75 is %0athe name given to a stone like a clouded callaina ; 7C a number %0aof them are always found united, it is said. Catochitis 77 is a %0astone found in Corsica, of larger size than the other precious %0aBtones ; and of a more wonderful nature, if the story is true, %0athat it retains the hand like gum, when placed upon it. Catop- %0atritis 78 is found in Cappadocia, and, from its whiteness, reflects %0afigures like a mirror. Cepitis 79 or cepolatitis is a white stone, %0awith veins upon it uniting together. Ceramitis 80 has a colour %0alike that of earthenware. %0a%0aCinsedia 81 is a stone found in the brain of a fish 82 of a corre- %0asponding name.

Chalco- %0aphonos 93 is a black stone, but when struck it clinks like brass : %0atragic actors are recommended to carry it about them. Of %0achelidonia 94 there are two varieties, both resembling the swal- %0alow in colour : one of them is purple on one side, and the %0aother is purple besprinkled with black spots. Chelonia 94 is the %0aeye of the Indian tortoise, and is the most marvellous of all the %0astones, if we believe the lying stories told by the magicians. %0aFor, according to them, this stone, placed upon the tongue after %0arinsing the mouth with honey, will ensure power of divina- %0ation, if this is done at full moon or new moon, for one whole %0aday. If, however, this plan is adopted while the moon is on %0athe increase, the power of divination will be acquired before %0asun-rise only, and if upon other days, from the first 96 hour to %0athe sixth. %0a%0aChelonitis, 97 too, is a stone that resembles the tortoise'* in %0aappearance, and the many virtues of which are talked of for %0acalming storms and tempests. As to the one that has all the %0aappearance of being sprinkled with spots of gold, if thrown %0awith a scarabaeus into boiling water, it will raise a tempest, %0athey say.

DIONYSIAS. %0a%0aDKACONITIS. %0a%0aDaphnea 7 is mentioned by Zoroaster as curative of epilepsy. %0aDiadochos 8 is a stone that resembles the beryl. Of diphyes 9 %0athere are two kinds, the white and the black, male and female, %0awith a line dividing the characteristics of either sex. Dionysias 10 %0ais hard and black, and covered with red spots. Triturated in %0awater, this stone imparts to it the flavour of wine, and it is %0agenerally thought to be a preservative against intoxication. %0aDraconitis 11 or dracontia is a stone produced from the brain of %0athe dragon ; n but unless the head of the animal is cut off %0awhile it is alive, the stone will not assume the form of a gem, %0athrough spite on the part of the serpent, when finding itself at %0athe point of death : hence it is that, for this purpose, the head %0ais cut off when it is asleep. 13 %0a%0aSotacus, who tells us that he once saw a stone of this kind in %0athe possession of a king, says that persons go in search of it in %0aa chariot drawn by two horses ; and that, the moment they see %0athe serpent, they strew narcotic drugs in its way, and then cut %0aoff its head when asleep.

Enorchis 16 is a white stone, the frag- %0aments of which, when it is split asunder, resemble the testes %0ain shape. Exebenus, Zoroaster tells us, is a white, handsome %0astone, employed by goldsmiths for polishing gold. Erythallis, 11 %0athough a white stone, assumes a red hue when viewed at an %0ainclined angle. Erotylos, 18 also known as " amphicomos"" %0aand " hieromnemon," 20 is highly praised byDemocritus for its %0ause in the art of divination. %0a%0aEumeces 21 is a stone of Bactriana, like silex in appearance ; %0aplaced beneath the head, it produces visions in the night of an %0aoracular description. Eumithres 22 is called by the Assyrians %0a"gem of Belus," 23 the most sacred of all their gods; it is of a %0aleek-green colour, and greatly in request for superstitious pur- %0aposes. Eupetalos 24 is a stone that has four different tints, %0aazure, fiery, vermilion, and apple-colour. Eureos 25 is similar %0ato an olive-stone in form, streaked like a shell, and moderately %0awhite.

It perhaps took its %0aname from Mithres, the god of the Sun among the Persians, and meant %0a" blessing of Mithres."

Galactitis 31 is of the uniform %0acolour of milk ; other names given to it are, leucogaia, 32 leu- %0acographitis, 33 and synnephitis, 31 and, when pounded in water, %0aboth in taste and colour it marvellously resembles milk. This %0asi one promotes the secretion of the milk in nursing women, it %0ais said ; in addition to which, attached to the neck of infants, it %0aproduces saliva, and it dissolves when put into the mouth. %0aThey say, too, that it deprives persons of their memory : it is %0ain the rivers Nilus and Acheloiis that it is produced. Some %0apersons give the name of " galactitis" to a smaragdus surrounded %0awith veins of white. Gallaica is a stone like argyrodamas, 36 %0abut of a somewhat more soiled appearance ; these stones are %0afound in twos and threes clustered together. The people of %0aMedia send us gassinade, 36 a stone like orobus in colour, and %0asprinkled with flowers, as it were : it is found at Arbela. %0aThis stone, too, conceives, 37 it is said ; a fact which it admits %0awhen shaken; the conception lasting for a period of three %0amonths.

It %0ahas been thus named, 44 from the circumstance that, if placed %0ain a vessel of water and exposed to the full light of the sun, %0ait changes to a reflected colour like that of blood; this being %0athe case with the stone of ^Ethiopia more particularly. Out %0aof the water, too, it reflects the figure of the sun like a mirror, %0aand it discovers eclipses of that luminary by showing the %0amoon passing over its disk. In the use of this stone, also, we %0ahave a most glaring illustration of the impudent effrontery %0aof the adepts in magic, for they say that, if it is combined with %0athe plant 45 heliotropium, and certain incantations are then re- %0apeated over it, it will render the person invisible who carries %0ait about him. %0a%0aHephaestitis 46 also, though a radiant stone, partakes of the %0aproperties of a mirror in reflecting objects. The mode of %0atesting it is to put it into boiling water, which should imme- %0adiately become cold.

Ham- %0amonis cornu 56 is reckoned among the most sacred gems of %0a^Ethiopia ; it is of a golden colour, like a ram's horn in shape, %0aand ensures prophetic dreams, it is said. %0a%0aHormiscion 56 is one of the most pleasing stones to the sight; %0ait is of a fiery colour, and emits rays like gold, tipped at the %0aextremity with a whitish light. Hysenia 67 is derived from the %0aeyes of the hyaena, it is said, the animal being hunted to ob- %0atain it ; placed beneath the tongue, if we believe the story, %0ait will enable a person to prophesy the future. Haematitis, 58 %0aof the very finest quality, comes from ^Ethiopia, but it is found %0ain Arabia and Africa as well. It is a stone of a blood-red %0acolour, and we must not omit to mention the assurance given %0a[by the magicians], that the possession of it reveals treacherous %0adesigns on the part of the barbarians. Zachalias of Babylon, %0ain the books which he dedicated to King Mithridates, attri- %0abuting the destinies of man to certain properties innate in %0aprecious stones, is not content with vaunting the merits of this %0astone as curative of diseases of the eyes and liver, but recom- %0amends it also as ensuring success to petitions addressed to %0akings.

Lysimachos resembles Rhodian %0amarble, with veins of gold : in polishing it, it is reduced very %0aconsiderably in size, in order to remove all defects.

Medea 75 is a black stone, said to have been discovered %0aby the Medea 76 of fable : it has veins of a golden lustre, and %0ayields a liquid like saffron in colour and with a vinous flavour. %0aMeconitis 77 strongly resembles poppies. Mithrax 78 comes from %0aPersia and the mountains of the lied Sea : it is of numerous %0acolours, and reflects various tints when exposed to the sun. 79 %0aMorochthos s0 is a stone of a leek-green colour, from which a milk %0aexudes. Mormorion 81 is a transparent stone from India, of a %0adeep black colour, and known also as "promnion." When it %0ahas a mixture of the colour 82 of carbunculus, it is from Alex- %0aandria ; and when it shares that of sarda, 83 it is a native of %0aCyprus. It is found also at Tyrus and in Galatia ; and, ac- %0acording to Xenocrates, it has been discovered at the foot of the %0a%0a69 " Variegated with white." 70 " Yellow incense." %0a%0a11 "Meadow-green stone." 72 " Fat stone." %0a%0a» " White gold."

There is a %0astatement also, that if this stone is placed upon altars it will %0aprevent the offerings from being consumed. Onocardia 96 * is %0alike kermesberry in appearance, but nothing further is said %0aabout it. Oritis, 97 by some called " sideritis," 88 is a stone of %0a%0a84 "Ectypae sculpturae."

Ostritis 3 receives its name from its resemblance to %0aan oyster-shell. Ophicardelon is the barbarian name for a %0a6tone of a black colour, terminated by a white line on either %0aside. Of Obsian 4 stone we have already spoken in the pre- %0aceding Book.

What kind of stone paneros 7 is, Metrodorus docs %0anot inform us ; but he gives some lines, by no means without %0aelegance, that were written upon this stone by Queen Timaris, %0aand dedicated to Venus ; from which we have reason to con- %0aclude that certain fecundating virtues were attributed to it. By %0asome writers it is called panerastos. 8 Of the stone called %0a" pontica" 9 there are numerous varieties : one is stellated, and %0apresents either blood-red spots, or drops like gold, being reck- %0aoned in the number of the sacred stones. Another, in place of %0astars, has streaks of the same colour, and a fourth presents all %0athe appearance of mountains and valleys. %0a%0a99 " Shell-stone." Not the same, probably, as the Cadmitis or Ostracitis %0amentioned in Chapter 56 of this Book. See B. xxxvi. c. 31, where a stone %0aof this name is also mentioned.

Thus, for example, there was a stone formerly dis- %0acovered in the gold-mines of Lampsacus, which, on account of %0aits extraordinary beauty, was sent to King Alexander, as we %0alearn from Theophrastus. 76 Cochlides, 77 too, which are now so %0acommon, are rather artificial productions than natural, and in %0aArabia there have been found vast masses of them ; which are %0aboiled, it is said, in honey, for seven days and nights without %0aintermission. By doing this, all earthy and faulty particles %0aare removed ; after which, the mass, thus cleansed and purified, %0ais adorned by the ingenuity of artists with variegated veins and %0aspots, and cut into such shapes as may be most to the taste of %0apurchasers.

As %0ato the stones which are variegated, and to which new colours %0aare imparted by the inventive ingenuity of man, as they have %0ano name in common use, they are usually known by that of %0a" physis;" 19 a name which claims for them, as it were, that ad- %0amiration which we are more ready to bestow upon the works %0aof Nature. But really, these artificial stones have names %0awithout end, and I could never think of recounting the infinite %0aseries of them, coined as they have been by the frivolous ten- %0adencies of the Greeks. %0a%0aHaving already described the more noble gems, and indeed %0athose of inferior qualit) r which are found among the stones that %0aare held in high esteem, I must content myself with knowing %0athat I have pointed out those kinds which are the most deserv- %0aing of mention. It will be as well, however, for the reader to %0abear in mind, that, according to the varying number of the %0aspots and inequalities on their surface, according to the nume- %0arous intersections of lines and their multiplied tints and shades, %0athe names of precious stones are subject to repeated changes ; %0athe material itself, for the most part, remaining just the same. %0a%0aCHAP. 75. THE VARIOUS FORMS OF PRECIOUS STONES. %0a%0aWe will now make some observations in reference to pre- %0acious stones in general, following therein the opinions that %0ahave been expressed by various authors. Stones with a level %0asurface are preferred to those which are concave or protuberant %0aon the face. An oblong shape is the one that is most approved %0aof, and, next to that, the lenticular 80 form, as it is called. After %0athis, the stone with a plane surface and circular is admired, %0athose which are angular being held in the least esteem. There %0ais considerable difficulty in distinguishing genuine stones from %0afalse ; the more so, as there has been discovered a method of %0atransforming genuine stones of one kind into false stones of %0a%0a%3c 8 ' " Phalerae."

Nay, even %0amore than this, there are books in existence, the authors of %0awhich I forbear to name, 83 which give instructions how to stain %0acrystal in such a way as to imitate smaragdus and other trans- %0aparent stones, how to make sardonyx of sarda, and other %0agems in a similar manner. Indeed, there is no kiud of fraud %0apractised, by which larger profits are made. %0a%0aCHAP. 76. (13.) THE METHODS OF TESTING PRECIOUS STONES. %0a%0aOn the contrary, we will make it our business to point out %0athe methods of detecting these false stones, seeing that it is %0aonly proper to put luxury even on its guard against, fraud. %0aIn addition to the particulars which we have already given, %0awhen treating of each individual kind of precious stone, it is %0agenerally agreed that transparent stones should be tested by %0aa morning light, or even, if necessary, so late as the fourth" 4 %0ahour, but never after that hour. The modes of testing 85 stones %0aare numerous : first, by their weight, the genuine stone being %0athe heavier of the two ; next, by their comparative coolness, %0athe genuine stone being cooler than the other to the mouth ; %0aand, next to that, by their substance ; there being blisters per- %0aceptible in the body of the fictitious stone, as well as a certain %0aroughness on the surface ; filaments, too, an unequal brilliancy, %0aand a brightness that falls short before it reaches the eye. %0aThe best 86 mode of testing is to strike off a fragment with %0aan iron saw ; but this is a thing not allowed by the %0adealers, who equally refuse to let their gems be tested by the %0atile. Dust of Obsian 87 stone will not leave a mark upon the %0asurface of a genuine stone : but where the gem is artificial, %0a%0a91 Substituting garnets for rubies, as an illustration. %0a%0an "Minium."

In all cases, however, precious stones %0amay be cut and polished by the aid of adamas ; M an operation %0awhich may be considerably expedited by heating the graver. %0aThe rivers which produce precious stones, are the Ace8inufa M %0aand the Ganges ; and, of all countries, India is the most pro- %0alific of them. %0a%0aCHAP. 77. A COMPARATIVE VIEW OF NATURE AS SHE APPEARS IN %0a%0aDIFFERENT COUNTRIES. THE COMPARATIVE VALUES OF THINGS. %0a%0aHaving now treated of all the works of Nature, it will be %0aas well to take a sort of comparative view of her several pro- %0aductions, as well as the countries which supply them. Through- %0aout the whole earth, then, and wherever the vault of heavi n %0aextends, there is no country so beautiful, or which, for the pro- %0aductions of Nature, merits so high a rank as Italy, that ruler %0aand second parent of the world ; recommended as she is by %0aher men, her women, her generals, her soldiers, her slaves, %0aher superiority in the arts, and the illustrious examples of %0agenius which she has produced. Her situation, too, is equally %0ain her favour ; the salubrity and mildness of her climate ; the %0aeasy access which she offers to all nations ; her coasts indented %0awith so many harbours; the propitious breezes, too, that always %0aprevail on her shores ; advantages, all of them, due to her situa- %0ation, lying, as she does, midway between the East and the West, %0aand extended in the most favourable of all positions. Add to %0athis, the abundant supply of her waters, the salubrity of her %0agroves, the repeated intersections of her mountain ranges, the %0acomparative innocuousness of her wild animals, the fertility of %0aher soil, and the singular richness of her pastures. %0a%0aWhatever there is that the life of man ought not to feel in %0awant of, is nowhere to be found in greater perfection than %0ahere ; the cereals, for example, wine, oil, wool, flax, tissue?, %0aand oxen. As to horses, there are none, I find, preferred to %0athose of Italy for the course j 90 while, for mines of gold, silver, %0a%0aB8 See Chapter 15 of this Book.

At %0athe present day, teeming as she is with these treasures, she %0acontents herself with lavishing upon us, as the whole of her %0abounties, her various liquids, and the numerous flavours yielded %0aby her cereals and her fruits. Next to Italy, if we except the %0afabulous regions of India, I would rank Spain, for my own %0apart, those districts, at least, that lie in the vicinity of the 6ea. 9! %0aShe is parched and sterile in one part, it is true ; but where %0ashe is at all productive, she yields the cereals in abundance, %0aoil, wine, horses, and metals of every kind. In all these re- %0aspects, Gaul is her equal, no doubt; but Spain, on the other %0ahand, outdoes the Gallic provinces in her spartum 93 and her %0a6pecular stone, 91 the products of her desert tracts, in her pig- %0aments that minister to our luxuries, in the ardour displayed by %0aher people in laborious employments, in the perfect training %0aof her slaves, in the robustness of body of her men, and in %0atheir general resoluteness of character. %0a%0aAs to the productions themselves, the greatest value of %0aall, among the products of the sea, is attached to pearls : %0aof objects that lie upon the surface of the earth, it is crystals %0athat are most highly esteemed : and of those derived from %0athe interior, adamas, 95 smaragdus, 96 precious stones, and murr- %0ahine, 97 are the things upon which the highest value is placed. %0aThe most costly things that are matured by the earth, are %0athe kermes-berry 98 and laser that are gathered from trees, %0anard 1 and Seric tissues ; 2 that are derived from the trunks of %0atrees, logs of citrus 3 -wood ; that are produced by shrubs, cin- %0a%0a91 It having heen in recent times declared unlawful to work them, as %0ahe has already informed us. %0a%0a92 "Quacunqne ambitur mari."

THE FIRST USE OF PRECIOUS STONES. %0a%3c %0a%3c That nothing may be wanting to the work which I have %0a%3c undertaken, it still remains for me to speak of precious stones : %0a%3c a subject in which the majestic might of Nature presents itself %0a%3c to us, contracted within a very limited space, though, in the %0a%3c opinion of many, nowhere displayed in a more admirable form. %0a%3c So great is the value that men attach to the multiplied varieties %0a%3c of these gems, their numerous colours, their constituent parts, %0a%3c and their singular beauty, that, in the case of some of them, it %0a%3c is looked upon as no less than sacrilege to engrave them, for %0a%3c signets even, the very purpose for which, in reality, they were %0a%3c made. Others, again, are regarded as beyond all price, and could %0a%3c not be valued, at any known amount of human wealth ; so much %0a%3c so that, in the case of many, it is quite sufficient to have some %0a%3c single gem or other before the eyes, there to behold the supreme %0a%3c and absolute perfection of Nature's work. %0a%3c %0a%3c "We have already 4 stated, to some extent, when speaking on %0a%3c the subject of gold and rings, how the use of precious stones %0a%3c first originated, and from what beginnings this admiration of %0a%3c them has now increased to such an universal passion. Ac- %0a%3c cording to fabulous lore, the first use of them was suggested %0a%3c by the rocks of Caucasus, in consequence of an unhappy inter- %0a%3c pretation which was given to the story of the chains of Pro- %0a%3c metheus : for we are told by tradition, that he enclosed a frag- %0a%3c ment of this etone in iron, and wore it upon his finger ; 2 such %0a%3c being the first ring and the first jewel known. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 2.

It so happened, however, that a fish of re- %0a%3c markable size, one destined for the table of a king, swallowed %0a%3c the jewel, as it would have done a bait ; and then, to com- %0a%3c plete the portentous omen, restored it again to the owner in the %0a%3c royal kitchen, by the ruling hand of a treacherous 4 fortune. %0a%3c %0a%3c The stone in this ring, it is generally agreed, was a sardonyx, 5 %0a%3c and they still show one at Home, which, if we believe the %0a%3c story, was this identical stone. It is enclosed in a horn of gold, %0a%3c and was deposited, by the Emperor Augustus, in the Temple %0a%3c of Concord, where it holds pretty nearly the lowest rank among %0a%3c a multitude of other jewels that are preferable to it. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 3. — THE JEWEL OF PYBKHUS. %0a%3c %0a%3c Next in note after this ring, is the jewel that belonged to %0a%3c s See B. xxxiii. c. 6. %0a%3c %0a%3c * For ultimately, Oroetes, the satrap of Sardes, contrived to allure him %0a%3c into his power, and had him crucified, B.C. 622. Fuller, in his Worthies, %0a%3c p. 370, tells a very similar story of the loss and recovery of his ring by %0a%3c one Anderson, a merchant of Newcastle-on-Tyne ; and Zuinglius gives a %0a%3c similar statement with reference to Arnulph, duke of Lorraine, who dropped %0a%3c his ring into the Moselle, and recovered it from the belly of a fish. %0a%3c %0a%3c 6 See Chapter 23. According to Herodotus, Pausanias, Dionysius of %0a%3c Halicarnassus, and Suidas, the stone was an emerald ; and Lessing thinks %0a%3c that there was no figure engraved on it. See Chapter 4 of this Book. %0a%3c Without vouching for the truth of it, we give the following extract from %0a%3c the London Journal, Vol. xxiii. No. 592. " A vine-dresser of Albano, %0a%3c near Home, is said to have found in a vineyard, the celebrated ring of %0a%3c %0a%3c Polycrates. The stone is of considerable size, and oblong in form. The %0a%3c %0a%3c engraving on it, by Theodore of Samos, the son of Talikles, is of extra- %0a%3c ordinary fineness and beauty. It represents a lyre, with three bees flying %0a%3c about; below, on the right, a dolphin; on the left, the head of a bull. %0a%3c The name of the engraver is inscribed in Greek characters. The upper %0a%3c surface of the stone is slightly concave, not highly polished, and one %0a%3c corner broken. It is asserted that tbe possessor has been offered 50,000 %0a%3c dollars for it." %0a%3c %0a%3c B B 2 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 383 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c pliny's natural history.

We %0a%3c only find it recorded by them, that Ismenias the flute-player 8 %0a%3c was in the habit of displaying great numbers of glittering %0a%3c stones, a piece of vanity, on his part, which gave occasion to %0a%3c the following story. An emerald, 9 upon which was engraved %0a%3c a figure of Amymone, 10 being offered for sale in the Isle of %0a%3c Cyprus at the price of six golden denarii, he gave orders to %0a%3c purchase it. The dealer however, reduced the price, and %0a%3c returned two denarii; upon which, Ismenias remarked — "By %0a%3c Hercules ! he has done me but a bad turn in this, for the merit %0a%3c of the stone has been greatly impaired by this reduction in %0a%3c price." %0a%3c %0a%3c It seems to have been this Ismenias who introduced the %0a%3c universal practice among musicians of proclaiming their artis- %0a%3c tic merit by this kind of ostentation. Thus Dionysodorus, for %0a%3c instance, his contemporary and rival, imitated his example, %0a%3c in order that he might not appear to be his inferior in skill ; %0a%3c whereas, in reality, he only held the third rank among the %0a%3c musicians of that day. Nicomachus, too, it is said, was the %0a%3c possessor of great numbers of precious stones, though selected %0a%3c with but little taste. In mentioning these illustrations, by way %0a%3c of prelude to this Book, it is by no means improbable that they %0a%3c may have the appearance of being addressed to those, who, %0a%3c piquing themselves upon a similar display, become puffed up %0a%3c with a vanity which is evidently much more appropriate to a %0a%3c performer on the flute. %0a%3c %0a%3c 6 "Achates."

WHO WERE THE MOST SKILFUL LAPIDARIES. THE %0a%3c %0a%3c FINEST SPECIMENS OF ENGRAVING ON PRECIOUS STONES. %0a%3c %0a%3c The stone of the ring 11 which is now shown as that of Poly- %0a%3c crates, is untouched and without engraving. In the time of %0a%3c lsmenias, long 12 after his day, it would appear to have become %0a%3c the practice to engrave smaragdi even ; a fact which is estab- %0a%3c lished by an edict of Alexander the Great, forbidding his por- %0a%3c trait to be cut upon this stone by any other engraver than %0a%3c Pyrgoteles, 13 who, no doubt, was the most famous adept in this %0a%3c art. Since his time, Apollonides and Cronius have excelled in %0a%3c it ; as also Dioscurides, 14 who engraved a very excellent likeness %0a%3c of the late Emperor Augustus upon a signet, which, ever since, %0a%3c the Roman emperors have used. The Dictator Sylla, it is %0a%3c said, always made use of a seal 15 which represented the sur- %0a%3c render of Jugurtha. Authors inform us also, that the native %0a%3c of Intercatia, 16 whose father challenged Scipio iEmilianus, 17 %0a%3c and was slain by him, was in the habit of using a signet %0a%3c with a representation of this conjbat engraved upon it ; a cir- %0a%3c cumstance which gave rise to the well-known joke of Stilo %0a%3c Proeconinus, 18 who naively enquired, what he would have done %0a%3c if Scipio had been the person slain ? %0a%3c %0a%3c The late Emperor Augustus was in the habit, at first, of %0a%3c using the figure of a Sphinx 19 for his signet ; having found %0a%3c two of them, among the jewels of his mother, that were per- %0a%3c fectly alike. During the Civil Wars, his friends used to employ %0a%3c one of these signets, in his absence, for sealing such letters %0a%3c and edicts as the circumstances of the times required to be %0a%3c issued in his name; it being far from an unmeaning pleasantry %0a%3c %0a%3c 11 This is said with reference to the one in the Temple of Concord, %0a%3c mentioned in Chapter 2. %0a%3c %0a%3c 12 But see Exodus xxvii. 9, et. seq, where it is shown that the prac- %0a%3c tice existed many hundreds of years before. %0a%3c %0a%3c 13 See B. vii. c. 38 ; where marble is the substance named. There are %0a%3c still two gems in existence said to have been engraved by this artist; but %0a%3c by some they are thought to be spurious. %0a%3c %0a%3c 14 There are many precious stones with his name, still extant : but only %0a%3c six appear to have been really engraved by him. %0a%3c %0a%3c 15 This signet is mentioned also by Plutarch and Valerius Maxiraus. %0a%3c %0a%3c 16 See B. iii. c. 4. %0a%3c %0a%3c 17 The younger Africanus. This circumstance is mentioned in the %0a%3c Epitome of Livy, B. xlviii. 18 See B. xxxiii. c. 5, and end of Book ix. %0a%3c %0a%3c " In reference to the ambiguous part which he acted, Ajaseou thinks, %0a%3c in the early part of his career. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 390 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c pliny's NATURAL 'HISTORY.

Varro and other authors of that period assure us, was %0a%3c greatly superior to that of Scaurus. Following his example, %0a%3c the Dictator Caesar consecrated six daetyliothecae in the Temple %0a%3c of Venus Genetrix ; and Marcellus, the son of Octavia, 23 pre- %0a%3c sented one to the Temple of the Palatine Apollo. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 6. — JEWELS DISPLAYED AT BOME IN THE TBIUMPH OP %0a%3c POMPEIUS MAGNUS. %0a%3c %0a%3c But it was this conquest by Pompeius Magnus that first %0a%3c introduced so general a taste for pearls and precious stones ; %0a%3c just as the victories, gained by L. Scipio 24 and Cneius Man- %0a%3c lius, 25 had first turned the public attention to chased silver, %0a%3c Attalic tissues, and banquetting-couches decorated with bronze; %0a%3c and the conquests of L. Muramius had brought Corinthian %0a%3c bronzes and pictures into notice. %0a%3c %0a%3c (2.) To prove more fully that this was the case, I will here %0a%3c give the very words of the public Registers 36 with reference %0a%3c to the triumphs of Pompeius Magnus.

Yes, I say, those frank features, so %0a%3c venerated throughout all nations, were here displayed in pearls! %0a%3c the severity of our ancient manners being thus subdued, and %0a%3c the display being more the triumph of luxury than the triumph %0a%3c of conquest. Never, most assuredly, would Pompeius have so %0a%3c long maintained his surname of "Magnus" among the men of %0a%3c that day, if on the occasion of his first 33 conquest his triumph %0a%3c had been such as this. Thy portrait in pearls, 0 Magnus ! those %0a%3c resources of prodigality, that have been discovered for the %0a%3c sake of females only ! Thy portrait in pearls, refinements in %0a%3c luxury, which the Roman laws would not have allowed thee to %0a%3c wear even ! And was it in this way that thy value must be appre- %0a%3c ciated ? Would not that trophy have given a more truthful like- %0a%3c ness of thee which thouhadst erst erected upon the Pyrenaean 3 ' %0a%3c mountain heights ? Assuredly such a portrait as this had been %0a%3c no less than a downright ignominy and disgrace, were we not %0a%3c bound to behold in it a menacing presage of the anger of the %0a%3c gods, and to see foreshadowed thereby the time when that head, %0a%3c now laden with the wealth of the East, was to be displayed, %0a%3c severed from the body. %0a%3c %0a%3c 26 A%3cu-C . 693. 29 30th of September 30 " Alveum lusorium." %0a%3c %0a%3c 31 Probably menning a shrine dedicated to the Muses. %0a%3c %0a%3c « See B. ii. c. 78, and B. vii. c. 60. 33 That of Africa. %0a%3c %0a%3c '* See B. vii. c. 27. %0a%3c %0a%3c M As was the case, after the murder of Pompey in Egypt. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 392 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c PLINY'S NATURAL HISTORY.

To the state, he presented two thousand millions of %0a%3c sesterces ; to the legati and quaestors who had exerted them- %0a%3c selves in defence of the sea coast, he gave one thousand millions %0a%3c of sesterces ; and to each individual soldier, six thousand ses- %0a%3c terces. He has rendered, however, comparatively excusable %0a%3c the Emperor Caius, S6 who, in addition to other feminine lux- %0a%3c uries, used to wear shoes adorned with pearls ; as also the %0a%3c Emperor Nero, who used to adorn his sceptres with masks %0a%3c worked in pearls, and had the couches, destined for his pleasures, %0a%3c made of the same costly materials. Nay, we have no longer any %0a%3c right, it would seem, to censure the employment of drinking- %0a%3c cups adorned with precious stones, of various other articles in %0a%3c daily use that are similarly enriched, and of rings that 6parkle %0a%3c with gems : for what species of luxury can there be thought of, %0a%3c that was not more innocent in its results than this on the part of %0a%3c Pompeius ? %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 7.

INSTANCES OF LUXURY IN REFERENCE TO %0a%3c THEM. %0a%3c %0a%3c It was the same conquest, too, that first introduced murrhine" %0a%3c vessels at Home ; Pompeius being the first to dedicate, at %0a%3c the conclusion of this triumph, vases and cups, made of this %0a%3c material, in the Temple of Jupiter Capitolinus : a circumstance %0a%3c which soon brought them into private use, waiters, even, and %0a%3c eating-utensils made of murrhine being in great request. %0a%3c This species of luxury, too, is daily on the increase, a single %0a%3c cup, which would hold no more than three sextarii, having %0a%3c been purchased at the price of seventy thousand sesterces. A %0a%3c person of consular rank, who some years 38 ago used to drink %0a%3c out of this cup, grew so passionately fond of it, as to gnaw its %0a%3c %0a%3c 36 Caligula. %0a%3c %0a%3c 37 Modern writers differ as to the material of which these vessels were %0a%3c composed. Some think that they were of variegated glass, and others of %0a%3c onyx ; but the more general opiuion is, that they were Chinese porcelain, %0a%3c and we have the line in Propertius, B. iv. El. 5, 1. 26. "And murrhine %0a%3c vessels baked on Parthian hearths." Ajasson is of opinion, from the de- %0a%3c scription given by Pliny, that these vessels were made of Fluor spar, or %0a%3c filiate of lime. " Myrrhine " is another reading of the word. %0a%3c %0a%3c 38 "Ante hos annos." Sillig is of opinion that the reading here should %0a%3c be " L. Annius," and that L. Annius Bassus, who was Consul suffectus in %0a%3c the year 70 a.d., is the person referred to ; or possibly, T. Arrius Antoninus, %0a%3c ■who was Consul suffectus, a.d. 69. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 8.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c TIIE NATTJBE OF MUBRTIINE VE8SELS. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 393 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c edges even, an injury, however, which has only tended to en- %0a%3c hance its value : indeed there is now no vessel in murrhine that %0a%3c has ever been estimated at a higher figure than this. "We %0a%3c may form some opinion how much money this same personage %0a%3c swallowed up in articles of this description, from the fact that %0a%3c the number of them was so great, that, when the Emperor %0a%3c Nero deprived his children of them, and they were exposed to %0a%3c public view, they occupied a whole theatre to themselves, in %0a%3c the gardens beyond the Tiber ; a theatre which was found %0a%3c sufficiently large even, for the audience that attended on the %0a%3c occasion when Nero 39 rehearsed his musical performances before %0a%3c his appearance in the Theatre of Pompeius. It was at this %0a%3c exhibition, too, that I saw counted the broken fragments of a %0a%3c single cup, which it was thought proper to preserve in an urn %0a%3c and display, I suppose, with the view of exciting the sorrows %0a%3c of the world, and of exposing the cruelty of fortune ; just as %0a%3c though it had been no less than the body of Alexander the %0a%3c Great himself ! %0a%3c %0a%3c T. Petronius, 41 a personage of consular rank, intending, from %0a%3c his hatred of Nero, to disinherit the table of that prince, broke %0a%3c a murrhine basin, which had cost him no less than three %0a%3c hundred thousand sesterces. But Nero himself, as it was only %0a%3c proper for a prince to do, surpassed them all, by paying one %0a%3c million of sesterces for a single cup : a fact well worthy of %0a%3c remembrance, that an emperor, the father of his country, %0a%3c should have drunk from a vessel of such costly price ! %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 8. THE NATURE OF MUBKHINE VESSELS. %0a%3c %0a%3c Murrhine vessels come from the East, in numerous localities %0a%3c of which, remarkable for nothing else, they are to be found. %0a%3c It is in the empire of the Parthians, more particularly, that %0a%3c they are met with, though those of the very finest quality %0a%3c come to us from Carmania. 41 It is generally thought that %0a%3c these vessels are formed of a moist substance, which under %0a%3c ground becomes solidified by heat. 42 In size they never ex- %0a%3c %0a%3c 39 The Gardens of Nero, in the Fourteenth Eegion of the City. %0a%3c %0a%3c 40 lie had been formerly a sharer in the debaucheries of Nero.

Some persons praise %0a%3c the edges of these vessels more particularly, with a kind of %0a%3c reflection in the colours, like those beheld in the rain-bow. %0a%3c Others, again, are more pleased with them when quite opaque, %0a%3c it being considered a demerit when they are at all transparent, %0a%3c or of a pallid hue. The appearance, too, of crystals 46 in them %0a%3c is highly prized, and of spots that look like warts ; not pro- %0a%3c minent, but depressed, as we mostly see upon the human body. %0a%3c The perfume, 47 too, of which they smell, is looked upon as an %0a%3c additional recommendation. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 9 THE NATURE OF CRYSTAL. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is a diametrically opposite cause to this that produces %0a%3c crystal, 48 a substance which assumes a concrete form from ex- %0a%3c cessive congelation, 49 At all events, crystal is only to be found %0a%3c in places where the winter snow freezes with the greatest in- %0a%3c tensity ; and it is from the certainty that it is a kind of ice, %0a%3c that it has received the name 50 which it bears in Greek. The %0a%3c East, too, sends us crystal, there being none preferred to the pro- %0a%3c duce of India. It is to be found, also, in Asia, that of the vicinity %0a%3c of Alabanda, 61 Orthosia, 52 and the neighbouring mountains, %0a%3c being held in a very low degree of esteem.

According to %0a%3c Juba, there is crystal in a certain island of the Red Sea, oppo- %0a%3c site the coast of Arabia, called "Necron ;" 53 as, also, in ano- %0a%3c ther neighbouring island 51 which produces the precious stone %0a%3c known as the " topazus ;" where a block of crystal was ex- %0a%3c tracted, he says, by Pythagoras, the praefect of King Ptole- %0a%3c maeus, no less than a cubit in length. %0a%3c %0a%3c Cornelius Bocchus informs us that in Lusitania, there have %0a%3c been blocks of crystal found, of extraordinary weight, in sinking %0a%3c shafts in the Ammiensian 55 mountains there, to a water-level %0a%3c for the supply of wells. It is a marvellous fact, stated by Xeno- %0a%3c crates of Ephesus, that in Asia and in the Isle of Cyprus, %0a%3c crystal is turned up by the plough ; it having been the general %0a%3c belief that it is never to be found in terreous soils, and only %0a%3c in rocky localities. That is much more probable which the %0a%3c same Xenocrates tells us, when he says that the mountain %0a%3c streams often bring down with them fragments of crystal. %0a%3c Sudines says, that crystal is only to be found in localities that %0a%3c face the south, a thing that is known to be really the fact : %0a%3c indeed, it is never found in humid spots, however cold the %0a%3c climate may be, even though the rivers there freeze to the very %0a%3c bottom, llain- water and pure snow are absolutely necessary %0a%3c for its formation, 56 and hence it is, that it is unable to endure %0a%3c heat, being solely employed for holding liquids that are taken %0a%3c cold. From the circumstance of its being hexagonal 07 and %0a%3c hexahedral, it is not easy to penetrate this substance ; and the %0a%3c more so, as the pyramidal terminations do not always have %0a%3c the same appearance. The polish on its faces is so exquisite, %0a%3c that no art can possibly equal it. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 10. — LUXURY DISPLAYED IN THE USE OF CRYSTAL.

[Book XXXVII. %0a%3c %0a%3c us, is the one that was consecrated by Julia Augusta in the Ca- %0a%3c pitol, and which weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds." %0a%3c Xenocrates speaks of having seen a vase of crystal, which held %0a%3c one amphora," and we find other writers mentioning a vessel %0a%3c from India which held four sextarii. For my own part, I can %0a%3c positively say, that there is crystal amid the crags of the Alps, %0a%3c so difficult of access, that it is usually found necessary to be %0a%3c suspended by ropes in order to extract it. Persons who are %0a%3c experienced in the matter detect its presence by certain signs %0a%3c and indications. f %0a%3c %0a%3c Crystal is subject to numerous defects, sometimes present- %0a%3c ing a rough, solder-like, substance, or else clouded by spots %0a%3c upon it; while occasionally it contains some hidden hu- %0a%3c mour 60 within, or is traversed by hard and brittle knurrs, 61 %0a%3c which are known as " salt grains." 62 Some crystal, too, has a %0a%3c red rust upon it, while, in other instances, it contains fila- %0a%3c ments that look like flaws, a defect which artists conceal by %0a%3c engraving it. But where crystals are entirely free from de- %0a%3c fect, they are preferred uncut ; in which case, they are known %0a%3c as " acenteta," 63 and have the colour, not of foam, but of %0a%3c limpid water. In the last place, the weight of crystals is a %0a%3c point which is taken into consideration. %0a%3c %0a%3c I find it stated by medical men that the very best cautery %0a%3c for the human body is a ball of crystal acted upon by the rays %0a%3c of the sun." This substance, too, has been made the object of %0a%3c a mania ; for, not many years ago, a mistress of a family, %0a%3c who was by no means very rich, gave one hundred and fifty %0a%3c thousand sesterces for a single basin made of crystal. Nero, %0a%3c on receiving tidings that all was lost, in the excess of his %0a%3c fury, dashed two cups of crystal to pieces ; this being his last %0a%3c act of vengeance upon his fellow-creatures, preventing any %0a%3c one from ever drinking again from these vessels. Crystal, %0a%3c when broken, cannot by any possibility be mended.

A MI! Ell : THE MANY FALSEHOODS THAT HAVE BEEN %0a%3c %0a%3c TOLD ABOUT IT. %0a%3c %0a%3c Next in rank among the objects of luxury, we have amber; 65 %0a%3c an article which, for the present, however, is in request among %0a%3c women 66 only. All these three last-mentioned substances hold %0a%3c the same rank, no doubt, as precious stones ; the two former %0a%3c for certain fair reasons ; crystal, because it is adapted for %0a%3c taking cool drinks, and murrhine vessels, for taking drinks that %0a%3c are either hot or cold. But as for amber, luxury has not been %0a%3c able, as yet, to devise any justification for the use of it. This %0a%3c is a subject which affords us an excellent opportunity of ex- %0a%3c posing some of the frivolities and falsehoods of the Greeks ; %0a%3c and I beg that my readers will only have patience with me %0a%3c while I do so, it being really worth while, for our own practi- %0a%3c cal improvement, to become acquainted with the marvellous %0a%3c stories which they have promulgated respecting amber. %0a%3c %0a%3c After Phaethon had been struck by lightning, his sisters, they %0a%3c tell us, became changed into poplars, 67 which every year shed %0a%3c their tears upon the banks of the Eridanus, a river known to %0a%3c us as the "PaduB." To these tearswas given thename of "elec- %0a%3c tium," 68 from the circumstance that the Sun was usually called %0a%3c " elector." Such is the story, at all events, that is told by %0a%3c many of the poets, the first of whom were, in my opinion, %0a%3c ^Eschylus, Philoxenus, Euripides, Satyrus, andNicander; and %0a%3c the falsity of which is abundantly proved upon the testi- %0a%3c mony of Italy itself. 69 Those among the Greeks who have %0a%3c devoted more attention to the subject, have spoken of certain %0a%3c islands in the Adriatic Sea, known as the " Electrides," and %0a%3c %0a%3c 65 " Succinum " It is of vegetable origin, and, according to Goppert, %0a%3c was originally the viscous resin of a tree named by him Finite* succinifer %0a%3c « It is used by men, more particularly, at the present day, as a moutu- %0a%3c %0a%3c P ' e «" e As S the vegetable origin of amber, there is no doubt that the ancients %0a%3c %0a%3c "™ Uost probably from flAioff, the "sun."

It is the %0a%3c fact, however, that there never were any islands there so called, %0a%3c nor, indeed, any islands so situate as to allow of the Padua %0a%3c carrying down anything in its course to their shores. As to %0a%3c ^Eschylus placing the Eridanus in Iberia, or, in other words, %0a%3c in Spain, and giving it the name of Khodanus ; and as to %0a%3c Euripides and Apollonius representing the llhodanus and the %0a%3c Padus as discharging themselves by one common mouth on %0a%3c the shores of the Adriatic ; we can forgive them all the more %0a%3c readily for knowing nothing about amber when they betray %0a%3c such monstrous ignorance of geography. %0a%3c %0a%3c Other writers, again, who are more guarded in their assertions, %0a%3c have told us, though with an equal degree of untruthfulness, %0a%3c that, at the extremity of the Adriatic Gulf, upon certain inac- %0a%3c cessible rocks there, there are certain trees 11 which shed their %0a%3c gum at the rising of the Dog-Star. Theophrastus 12 has stated %0a%3c that amber is extracted from the earth in Liguria ; 13 Chares, %0a%3c that Phaethon died in the territory of Hammon, in ^Ethiopia, %0a%3c where there is a temple of his and an oracle, and where amber %0a%3c is produced; Philemon, that it is a fossil substance, and that %0a%3c it is found in two different localities in Scythia, in one of %0a%3c which it is of a white and waxen colour, and is known as %0a%3c " electrum ;" while in the other it is red, and is called " sua- %0a%3c liternicum." Demostratus calls amber " lyncurion,"' 4 and he %0a%3c says that it originates in the urine of the wild beast known as %0a%3c the " lynx;" that voided by the male producing a red and fiery %0a%3c substance, and that by the female an amber of a white and %0a%3c less pronounced colour : he also informs us that by some per- %0a%3c sons it is called " langurium," and that in Italy, there are %0a%3c certain wild beasts known as " languri." Zenothemis, how- %0a%3c %0a%3c 70 In reality, these " Amber Islands" were situate at the mouth of the %0a%3c Vistula, into which the Radanus discharged itself; a river whose name was %0a%3c afterwards confounded with "Eridanus," the ancient name of the Padus, %0a%3c or Po.

Sudines says, that it is a %0a%3c tree in reality, that produces amber, and that, in Etruria, this %0a%3c tree is known by the name of " lynx ;" an opinion which is %0a%3c also adopted by Metrodorus. Sotacus expresses a belief that %0a%3c amber exudes from certain stones in Britannia, to which he %0a%3c gives the name of " electrides." Pytheas says that the %0a%3c Gutones, 75 a people of Germany, inhabit the shores of an %0a%3c sestuary of the Ocean called Mentonomon, their territory ex- %0a%3c tending a distance of six thousand stadia; that, at one day's %0a%3c sail from this territory, is the Isle of Abalus, upon the shores %0a%3c of which, amber is thrown up by the waves in spring, it being %0a%3c an excretion of the sea in a concrete form ; as, also, that the %0a%3c inhabitants use this amber by way of fuel, and sell it to their %0a%3c neighbours, the Teutones. Timaeus, too, is of the same be- %0a%3c lief, but he has given to the island the name of Basilia. 76 %0a%3c %0a%3c Philemon says that electrum does not yield a flame. 77 Nicias, %0a%3c again, will have it, that it is a liquid produced by the rays of %0a%3c the sun ; and that these rays, at the moment of the sun's %0a%3c setting, striking with the greatest force upon the surface of %0a%3c the soil, leave upon it an unctuous sweat, which is carried off %0a%3c by the tides of the Ocean, and thrown up upon the shores of %0a%3c Germany. He states, also, that in Egypt it is similarly pro- %0a%3c duced, and is there called " sacal ;" 78 that it is found in India, %0a%3c too, where it is held as a preferable substitute for frankin- %0a%3c cense ; and that in Syria the women make the whirls of their %0a%3c spindles of this substance, and give it the name of " harpax,"' 9 %0a%3c from the circumstance that it attracts leaves towards it, chaff, %0a%3c and the light fringe of tissues. According to Theochrestus^ %0a%3c amber is thrown up by the tides of the Ocean, at the foot of %0a%3c the Pyrencean range ; an opinion adopted also by Xenocrates. %0a%3c Asarubas, who has written the most recently upon these sub- %0a%3c jects, and is still living, informs us, that near the shores of the %0a%3c Atlantic is Lake Cephisis, known to the Mauri by the name %0a%3c of " Electrum ;" and that when this lake is dried up by the %0a%3c sun, the slime of it produces amber, which floats upon %0a%3c the surface.

Theomenes says that near the Greater %0a%3c Syrtis are the Gardens of the Hesperides, and Lake Electrum : %0a%3c on the banks, he says, are poplars, from the summits of which %0a%3c amber falls into the water below, where it is gathered by the %0a%3c maidens of the Hesperides. %0a%3c %0a%3c Ctesias asserts that there is in India 81 a river called Hypo- %0a%3c barus, a word which signifies " bearer of all good things ;" %0a%3c that this river flows from the north into the Eastern Ocean, %0a%3c where it discharges itself near a mountain covered with trees %0a%3c which produce electrum ; and that these trees are called %0a%3c " siptachorse," the meaning of which is " intense sweetness." %0a%3c Mithridates says, that off the shores of Germany there is an %0a%3c island called " Serita," 82 covered with a kind of cedar, from %0a%3c which amber falls upon the rocks. According to Xenocrates, %0a%3c this substance is called, in Italy, not only " succinum," but %0a%3c " thieum " as well, the Scythian name of it, for there also it %0a%3c is to be found, being " sacrium :" others, he says, are of opi- %0a%3c nion that it is a product of Numidia. But the one that has %0a%3c surpassed them all is Sophocles, the tragic poet ; a thing that %0a%3c indeed surprises me, when I only consider the surpassing %0a%3c gravity of his lofty style, the high repute that he enjoyed in %0a%3c life, his elevated position by birth at Athens, his various ex- %0a%3c ploits, and his high military command. According to him, %0a%3c amber is produced in the countries beyond India, from the tears %0a%3c that are shed for Meleager, by the birds called " meleagrides !" 83 %0a%3c "Who can be otherwise than surprised that he should have be- %0a%3c lieved such a thing as this, or have hoped to persuade others %0a%3c to believe it ? What child, too, could possibly be found in such %0a%3c a state of ignorance as to believe that birds weep once a year, %0a%3c that their tears are so prolific as this, or that they go all the %0a%3c way from Greece, where Meleager died, to India to weep ? %0a%3c " But then," it will be said, " do not the poets tell many other %0a%3c stories that are quite as fabulous ?" Such is the fact, no doubt, %0a%3c %0a%3c so See B. x. c. 38. %0a%3c %0a%3c 81 All this is based, Ajasson thinks, upon the stoiies of Hindoo mythology. %0a%3c 81 The old reading is " Osericta :" Ajasson identifies it with the island %0a%3c of Oe'sel in the Baltic. 93 See B. x. c. 38. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 11.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c AMBER. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 401 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c but for a person seriously to advance such an absurdity with %0a%3c reference to a thing so common as amber, which is imported %0a%3c every day and so easily proves the mendacity of this assertion, %0a%3c is neither more nor less than to evince a supreme contempt %0a%3c for the opinions of mankind, and to assert with impunity an %0a%3c intolerable falsehood. %0a%3c %0a%3c (3.) There can be no doubt that amber is a product of the %0a%3c islands of the Northern Ocean, and that it is the substance by %0a%3c the Germans called " gla3sum ;" 84 for which reason the Eomans, %0a%3c when Germanicus Caesar commanded the fleet in those parts, %0a%3c gave to one of these islands the name of Glaesaria, 85 which by the %0a%3c barbarians was known as Austeravia. Amber is produced from %0a%3c a marrow discharged by trees belonging to the pine 86 genus, like- %0a%3c gum from the cherry, and resin from the ordinary pine. It is %0a%3c a liquid at first, which issues forth in considerable quantities, %0a%3c and is gradually hardened by heat or cold, or else by the action %0a%3c of the sea, when the rise of the tide carries off the fragments %0a%3c from the shores of these islands. At all events, it is thrown %0a%3c up upon the coasts, in so light and voluble a form that in the %0a%3c shallows it has all the appearance of hanging suspended in the %0a%3c water. Our forefathers, too, were of opinion that it is the juice %0a%3c of a tree, and for this reason gave it the name of " succinum :" 87 %0a%3c and one great proof that it is the produce of a tree of the pine %0a%3c genus, is the fact that it emits a pine-like smell when rubbed, %0a%3c and that it burns, when ignited, with the odour and appearance %0a%3c of torch-pine wood. %0a%3c %0a%3c Amber is imported by the Germans into Pannonia, more %0a%3c particularly ; from whence the Veneti, by the Greeks called %0a%3c Eneti, first brought it into general notice, a people in the %0a%3c vicinity of Pannonia, and dwelling on the shores of the %0a%3c Adriatic Sea.

Traversing the coasts of that country %0a%3c and visiting the various markets there, he brought back amber, %0a%3c in such vast quantities, as to admit of the nets, which are used %0a%3c for protecting the podium 89 against the wild beasts, being %0a%3c studded 90 with amber. %0a%3c %0a%3c The arms too, the litters, 91 and all the other apparatus, were, %0a%3c on one day, decorated with nothing but amber, a different kind %0a%3c of display being made each day that these spectacles were exhi- %0a%3c bited. The largest piece of amber that this personage brought %0a%3c to Home was thirteen pounds in weight. %0a%3c %0a%3c That amber is found in India too, is a fact well ascertained. %0a%3c Archelaiis, who reigned over Cappadocia, says that it is brought %0a%3c from that country in the rough state, and with the fine bark %0a%3c still adhering to it, it being the custom there to polish it by %0a%3c boilirjg it in the grease of a sucking-pig. One great proof that %0a%3c amber must have been originally in a liquid state, is the fact %0a%3c that, owing to its transparency, certain objects are to be seen %0a%3c within, ants for example, gnats, and lizards. These, no doubt, %0a%3c must have first adhered to it while liquid, and then, upon its %0a%3c hardening, have remained enclosed within. 92 %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 12. THE SEVERAL KINDS OF AMBER: THE REMEDIES %0a%3c %0a%3c DERIVED FROM IT. %0a%3c %0a%3c There are several kinds 93 of amber.

The red amber is more %0a%3c highly valued ; and still more so, -when it is transparent, with- %0a%3c out presenting too brilliant and igneous an appearance. For %0a%3c amber, to be of high quality, should present a brightness like %0a%3c that of fire, but not flakes resembling those of flame. The %0a%3c most highly esteemed amber is that known as the " Falernian," %0a%3c from its resemblance to the colour of Falernian wine ; it is %0a%3c perfectly transparent, and has a softened, transparent, brightness. %0a%3c Other kinds, again, are valued for their mellowed tints, like the %0a%3c colour of boiled honey in appearance. It ought to be known, %0a%3c however, that any colour can be imparted to amber that may %0a%3c be desired, it being sometimes stained with kid-suet and root %0a%3c of alkanet ; indeed, at the present day, amber is dyed purple %0a%3c even. "When a vivifying heat has been imparted to it by %0a%3c rubbing it between the fingers, amber will attract chaff, dried %0a%3c leaves, and thin bark, just in the same way that the magnet %0a%3c att racts iron. Pieces of amber, steeped in oil, burn with a more %0a%3c brilliant and more lasting flame than pith of flax. 95 %0a%3c %0a%3c So highly valued is this as an object of luxury, that a very %0a%3c diminutive human effigy, made of amber, has been known to sell %0a%3c at a higher price than living men even, in stout and vigorous %0a%3c health. This single ground for censure, however, is far from %0a%3c being sufficient ; in Corinthian objects of vertu, it is the copper %0a%3c that recommends them, combined with silver and gold ; and in %0a%3c embossed works it is the skill and genius of the artist that %0a%3c is so highly esteemed. We have already said what it is that %0a%3c recommends vessels of murrhine and of crystal ; pearls, too, are %0a%3c of use for wearing upon the head, and gems upon the fingers. %0a%3c In the case of all other luxuries, in fact, it is either a spirit of %0a%3c ostentation or some utility that has been discovered in them %0a%3c that pleads so strongly in their behalf; but in that of amber %0a%3c we have solely the consciousness that we are enjoying a luxury, %0a%3c and nothing more. Domitius Nero, among the other porten- %0a%3c tous extravagances of his life, bestowed this name upon the %0a%3c ringlets of his wife Poppaea, and, in certain verses of his, he has %0a%3c %0a%3c » Which is perceptible on its bsing rubbed : in some cases the odour of %0a%3c amber is very fine, in others it is perfectly fetid; though in the la ter %0a%3c case, as Ajasson remarks, it is doubtful whether it may be considered to %0a%3c be pen uine amber. ,, %0a%3c %0a%3c » " Lini."

As fine names, %0a%3c too, are never wanting for bodily defects, a third tint has been %0a%3c introduced of late for hair among our ladies, under the name of %0a%3c " amber-colour." %0a%3c %0a%3c Amber, however, is not without its utility in a medicinal %0a%3c point of view ; though it is not for this reason that the women %0a%3c are so pleased with it. It is beneficial for infants also, attached %0a%3c to the body in the form of an amulet ; and, according to Callis- %0a%3c tratus, it is good for any age, as a preventive of delirium and as %0a%3c a cure for strangury, either taken in drink or attached as an %0a%3c amulet to the body. This last author, too, has invented a new %0a%3c variety of amber ; giving the name of " chryselectrum" 96 to an %0a%3c amber of a golden colour, and which presents the most beauti- %0a%3c ful tints in the morning. This last kind attracts flame, too, %0a%3c with the greatest rapidity, and, the moment it approaches the %0a%3c fire, it ignites. Worn upon the neck, he says, it is a euro %0a%3c for fevers and other diseases, and, triturated with honey and %0a%3c oil of roses, it is good for maladies of the ears. Beaten up %0a%3c with Attic honey, it is good for dimness of sight ; and the %0a%3c powder of it, either taken by itself or with gum mastich in %0a%3c water, is remedial for diseases of the stomach. Amber, too, is %0a%3c greatly in request for the imitation of the transparent precious %0a%3c stones, amethystos in particular : for, as already stated, it %0a%3c admits of being dyed of every colour. %0a%3c %0a%3c chap. 13. — lynctjrium: two asserted remedies. %0a%3c %0a%3c The pertinacity that has been displayed by certain authors %0a%3c compels me to speak of lyncurium 97 next; for even those who %0a%3c maintain that it is not a variety of amber, still assure us that %0a%3c it is a precious stone. They assert, too, that it is a product of %0a%3c the urine of the lynx and of a kind of earth, the animal %0a%3c covering up the urine the moment it has voided it, from a %0a%3c jealousy that man should gain possession of it ; a combination %0a%3c which hardens into stone. The colour of it, they inform us, %0a%3c %0a%3c « " Golden amber." Brotero thinks that this must have been Hyacinth %0a%3c or Zirconite of a yellowish white colour.

TWO REMEDIES. %0a%3c %0a%3c The substance that possesses the greatest value, not only %0a%3c among the precious stones, but of all human possessions, is %0a%3c adamas ; l a mineral which, for a long time, was known to kings %0a%3c %0a%3c 99 Ajasson thinks that Rubellite or Red Tourmaline is here alluded to. %0a%3c %0a%3c 99 This is the case with tourmaline when subjected to heat. %0a%3c %0a%3c 1 We may here remark, that throughout this Book, in all cases where %0a%3c there is any doubt as to the identification of the substance, the ancient %0a%3c name is retained. Hence our words " adamant " and " diamond." If Pliny %0a%3c means the latter, which is doubtful, it still maintains the rank hero assigned %0a%3c to it. The word "adamas" is supposed to be derived from the Greek a, %0a%3c privative, and Sa/iuw, " to subdue," it being supposed to be invincible by %0a%3c fire. The diamond is pure carbon crystallized, and is thought to have been %0a%3c of vegetable origin. Dana has the following remarks upon the word %0a%3c " adamas." — " This name was applied by the ancients to several minerals %0a%3c differing much iu their physical properties. A few of these are quartz, %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 406 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c PLINY' 8 NATURAL HISTORY. [Book XXXVII. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c only, and to very few of them. Such was the name given to %0a%3c a nodosity of gold, 2 sometimes, though but rarely, found in the %0a%3c mines, in close proximity with gold, and only there to be %0a%3c found, it was thought. The ancients supposed that adamas %0a%3c was only to be discovered in the mines of ^Ethiopia, 3 between %0a%3c the Temple of Mercury and the island of Meroe ; and they %0a%3c have informed us that it was never larger than a cucumber- %0a%3c seed, or differing at all from it in colour. %0a%3c %0a%3c At the present day, for the first time, there are no less than %0a%3c six different varieties of it recognized. The Indian adamas is %0a%3c found, not in a stratum of gold, but in a substance of a %0a%3c kindred nature to crystal ; which it closely resembles in its %0a%3c transparency and its highly polished hexangular and hexahe- %0a%3c dral 4 form. In shape it is turbinated, running to a point at %0a%3c either extremity, and closely resembling, marvellous to think %0a%3c of, two cones united at the base. In size, too, it is as large %0a%3c even as a hazel-nut. Resembling that of India, is the adamas 4 %0a%3c of Arabia, which is found in a similar bed, but not so large in %0a%3c size. Other varieties have a pallid hue like that of silver, %0a%3c and are only to be found in the midst of gold of the very %0a%3c finest quality. These stones are tested upon the anvil, and %0a%3c will resist the blow to such an extent, as to make the iron re- %0a%3c bound and the very anvil split asunder. 6 Indeed its hardness %0a%3c is beyond all expression, while at the same time it quite sets %0a%3c fire at defiance 7 and is incapable of being heated ; owing to %0a%3c %0a%3c specular iron ore, emery, and other substances of rather high degrees of %0a%3c hardness, which cannot now be identified. It is doubtful whether Pliny %0a%3c had any acquaintance with the real diamond." — System of Mineralogy, Art. %0a%3c Diamond. We may also add, from the same authority, that the method of %0a%3c polishing diamonds was first discovered in 1456, by Louis Berquen, a citizen %0a%3c of Bruges, previous to which time the diamond was only known in iu %0a%3c native uncut state. %0a%3c %0a%3c 2 This statement cannot apply to the "diamond" as known to us, %0a%3c though occasionally grains of gold have been found in the vicinity of the %0a%3c diamond. %0a%3c %0a%3c 3 Ajasson is of opinion that the Ethiopia here mentioned is in reality %0a%3c India, and that the "Temple of Mercury" means the Brahmaloka, or Tem- %0a%3c ple of Brahma. %0a%3c %0a%3c * The diamond, as known to us, is octahedral. %0a%3c %0a%3c 5 Though found in comparative abundance in India, the diamond is not %0a%3c found in Arabia. %0a%3c %0a%3c 6 This is not the case with the diamond ; for on being struck under such %0a%3c circumstances, it will break. %0a%3c %0a%3c 1 In reality, the diamond will burn, and, at a temperature of 14° Wedge- %0a%3c wood, is wholly consumed, producing carbonic acid gas. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 15.

We next %0a%3c come to the Cyprian 11 adamas, so called from its being found %0a%3c in the Isle of Cyprus : it is of a colour somewhat inclining to %0a%3c that of copper, but, in reference to its medicinal virtues, of %0a%3c which we shall have to make further mention, it is the most %0a%3c efficacious of them all. Next in succession to this we have %0a%3c 6iderite8, 12 a stone which shines like iron, and is more ponderous %0a%3c than any of the others, but differs in its properties from them %0a%3c all. For it breaks when struck by the hammer, and admits of %0a%3c being perforated by other kinds of adamas ; a thing which is %0a%3c the case, also, with that of Cyprus : in short, these two are %0a%3c degenerate stones, and only bear the name of "adamas" for %0a%3c the purpose of enhancing their value. %0a%3c %0a%3c Now with reference to those affinities and repugnances which %0a%3c exist between certain objects, known to the Greeks as sym- %0a%3c pathia" and " antipathia," phenomena to which we have en- %0a%3c deavoured 13 to draw attention thoughout these books, they no- %0a%3c where manifest themselves with greater distinctness than here. %0a%3c This indomitable power, in fact, which sets at nought the %0a%3c two most violent agents in Nature, fire, namely, and iron, is %0a%3c made to yield before the blood of a he-goat. u The blood, %0a%3c however must be no otherwise than fresh and warm ; the stone, %0a%3c too, must be well steeped in it, and then subjected to repeated %0a%3c blows : and even then, it is apt to break both anvils and ham- %0a%3c mers of iron, if they are not of the very finest temper. To %0a%3c what spirit of research, or to what accident, are we indebted for %0a%3c this discovery ? or what conjecture can it have been, that first %0a%3c %0a%3c 8 See Note 1, above. 9 "Millet-seed." %0a%3c %0a%3c 10 Ajasson 6ays, that no doubt this adamas was Adamantine, or limpid %0a%3c Corundum. %0a%3c %0a%3c 11 Ajasson suggests that this may have been Dichroite, or Cordierite, %0a%3c known also as Iolite, or Water sapphire. %0a%3c %0a%3c 12 Possibly the Siderite, sparry iron, or spathic iron of modern Min- %0a%3c eralogy. Ajasson is inclined to think that it is Corundum, of a dark hue. %0a%3c %0a%3c 13 See B. xx. c. 1, B. xxviii. cc. 23, 41, and B. xxxii. c. 12 %0a%3c %0a%3c 14 Brotero thinks that this was a story invented by the dealers, with a %0a%3c view of concealing the real method of breaking the stone. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 408 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c pliny's natural itistokt. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XXXVII. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c led man to experiment upon a thing of such extraordinary %0a%3c value as this, and that, too, with the most unclean 14 of all %0a%3c animals ? Surely a discovery, such as this, must have been due %0a%3c solely to the munificence of the gods, and we must look for %0a%3c the reason of it in none of the elementary operations of %0a%3c Nature, but wholly in her will. %0a%3c %0a%3c When, by good fortune, this stone does happen to be broken, %0a%3c it divides into fragments so minute as to be almost impercep- %0a%3c tible. These particles are held in great request by engravers, %0a%3c who enclose them in iron, and are enabled thereby, with the %0a%3c greatest facility, to cut 16 the very hardest substances known. %0a%3c So great is the antipathy borne by this stone to the magnet, %0a%3c that when placed near, it will not allow of its attracting %0a%3c iron; or if the magnet has already attracted the iron, it will %0a%3c seize the metal and drag it away from the other. 17 Adamas, %0a%3c too, overcomes and neutralizes poisons, dispels delirium, and %0a%3c banishes groundless perturbations of the mind ; hence it is %0a%3c that some have given it the name of " ananchites." 18 Mctro- %0a%3c dorus of Scepsis is the only author, that I know of, who says %0a%3c that this stone is found also in Germany, and in the island of %0a%3c Basilia, 19 where amber is found. He says, too. that this is pre- %0a%3c ferable to the stone of Arabia ; but can there be any doubt %0a%3c that his statement is incorrect ? %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 16. — SMARAGDTJS. %0a%3c %0a%3c Next 20 in esteem with us are the pearls of India and Arabia, %0a%3c of which we have already spoken in the Ninth Book, 21 when %0a%3c treating of the marine productions. %0a%3c %0a%3c (5.) The third rank, for many reasons, has been given to %0a%3c %0a%3c 15 Said, probably, witb reference to the rank, nauseous smell of the he- %0a%3c goat. %0a%3c %0a%3c 16 This is true with reference to the diamond, and, in a less degree, %0a%3c several other crystalline substances, emery and quartz, for example. %0a%3c %0a%3c 11 Ajasson remarks, that if the diamond is placed in the magnetic line %0a%3c or current of the loadstone, it attracts iron equally with the loadstone, %0a%3c and consequently neutralizes the attractive power of the loadstone in a %0a%3c considerable degree. %0a%3c %0a%3c 18 The reading is very doubtful here. This word, as it is here given, %0a%3c would appear to be derived from the Greek d privative, and dy^o/tai, %0a%3c " to strangle oneself," and to mean, "preventive of suicide." %0a%3c %0a%3c 19 See B. iv. c. 27, and Chapter 11 of this Book. %0a%3c %0a%3c 20 At the present day the ruby is next in esteem to the diamond. %0a%3c %0a%3c 21 Chapter 54, et teq. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Cbap. 16.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c SHAKAGDUS. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 409 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c the smaragdus. 22 Indeed there is no stone, the colour of which %0a%3c is more delightful to the eye ; for whereas the sight fixes itself %0a%3c with avidity upon the green 23 grass and the foliage of the trees, %0a%3c we have all the more pleasure in looking upon the smaragdus, %0a%3c there being no green in existence of a more intense colour 21 %0a%3c than this. And then, besides, of all the precious stones, this is %0a%3c the only one that feeds the sight without satiating it. Even %0a%3c when the vision has been fatigued with intently viewing other %0a%3c objects, it is refreshed by being turned upon this stone ; and %0a%3c lapidaries know of nothing that is more gratefully soothing to %0a%3c the eyes, its soft green tints being wonderfully adapted for %0a%3c assuaging lassitude, when felt in those organs. %0a%3c %0a%3c And then, besides, when viewed from a distance, these stones %0a%3c appear all the larger to the sight, reflecting as they do, their %0a%3c green hues upon the circumambient air. Neither sunshine, %0a%3c shade, nor artificial light effects any change in their appearance ; %0a%3c they have always a softened and graduated brilliancy ; and %0a%3c transmitting the light with facility, they allow the vision to %0a%3c penetrate their interior ; a property which is so pleasing, also, %0a%3c with reference to water. In form they are mostly concave, so %0a%3c as to re-unite the rays of light and the powers of vision : %0a%3c and hence it is, that it is so universally agreed upon among %0a%3c mankind to respect these stones, and to forbid their surface 25 %0a%3c to be engraved. In the case, however, of the stones of Scythia %0a%3c and Egypt, their hardness is such, that it would be quite im- %0a%3c possible to penetrate them. When the surface of the smaragdus %0a%3c is flat, it reflects the image of objects in the same manner as %0a%3c a mirror. The Emperor Nero used to view 26 the combats of %0a%3c the gladiators upon a smaragdus. %0a%3c %0a%3c 22 The Emerald, and various other green precious stones, were included %0a%3c under this name. %0a%3c %0a%3c 23 " Virentes" seems a very preferable reading to "silentes," as given %0a%3c by the Bamberg MS. %0a%3c %0a%3c 24 The emerald is supposed to derive this colour from a minute portion %0a%3c of oxide of chrome. %0a%3c %0a%3c M Engraved emeralds are but seldom found among collections of ancient %0a%3c gems.

None of them has a deeper %0a%3c colour than this, or is more free from defects : indeed, in the %0a%3c same degree that the smaragdus is superior to other precious %0a%3c stones, the Scythian smaragdus is superior to the other varie- %0a%3c ties. Next in esteem to this, as also in locality, is the smarag- %0a%3c dus of Bactriana. 29 These stones are collected, it is said, in the %0a%3c fissures of rocks, when the Etesian 30 winds prevail ; a period %0a%3c at which the earth that covers them is removed, and the stones %0a%3c are detected by their brightness, the sands being greatly agi- %0a%3c tated by the action of the winds. These last, however, are %0a%3c much inferior, they say, to those of Scythia in size. The third %0a%3c rank is held by the stones of Egypt, 31 which are extracted from %0a%3c the hills in the vicinity of Coptos, a city of Thebais. %0a%3c %0a%3c All the other kinds are found in copper-mines, and hence it %0a%3c is that, of these varieties, the smaragdus of Cyprus holds the %0a%3c highest rank. The merit of them consists in their clear colour, %0a%3c which has nothing thin or diluted in it, but presents a rich %0a%3c and humid transparency, closely resembling the tints of the %0a%3c sea, in fact. Hence it is that these stones are at once diapha- %0a%3c nous and shining, or, in other words, reflect their colours and %0a%3c allow the vision to penetrate within. They say that in this %0a%3c island, upon the tomb of a petty king named Hermias, near %0a%3c the fisheries 32 there, there was formerly a lion in marble, with %0a%3c eyes made of smaragdi; the brilliancy of which penetrated %0a%3c %0a%3c lava, or the green Icelandic agate, as it is called, green jasper, and also green %0a%3c glass." — Beckmann, Hist. Inv. Vol. II. p. 67. Bohn's Edition. It has %0a%3c also been suggested, with reference to this passage, that Nero was short- %0a%3c sighted, and that this emerald was formed like a concave lens. The passage, %0a%3c however, will hardly support such a construction. Ajasson thinks that it %0a%3c must have been a Dioptase or Siberian emerald ; or else a green Corundum. %0a%3c %0a%3c 28 Ajasson is of opinion that the Dioptase, Siberian emerald, or Mala- %0a%3c chite emerald is meant. %0a%3c %0a%3c " Ajasson thinks that this may be the Dioptase or Achirite of Chinese %0a%3c Bucharia; and that the merchant Achir Mahmed, from whom it takes its %0a%3c name, was by no means the first to4ntroduce it, or to circulate his wonder- %0a%3c ful stories as to its formation. %0a%3c %0a%3c 30 See B. ii. cc. 47, 48, and B. xviii. c. 74. %0a%3c %0a%3c 31 Mount Zalora. in Upper Egypt, still produces emeralds, and was pro- %0a%3c bably the only locality of the genuine stone that was known to the ancients. %0a%3c %0a%3c 32 "Cetarias." %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 18.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c DEFECTS IK THE SMABAGDUS. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 411 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c the sea to such a degree, as to alarm the tunnies and put them %0a%3c to flight : a novel circumstance, which for a long time excited %0a%3c wonder in the fishermen, till at last the stones in the statue %0a%3c were changed for others. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 18. — DEFECTS IN THE SMA.RAGDTJ8. %0a%3c %0a%3c It will he only proper, too, seeing that the prices of these %0a%3c stones are so exorbitant, to point out their defects, gome %0a%3c defects, no doubt, are common to all of them, while others, %0a%3c again, like those found in the human race, are peculiar only %0a%3c to those of a certain country. Thus, for example, the stones %0a%3c of Cyprus are not all green alike, and in the same smaragdus %0a%3c some parts are more or less so than others, the stone not always %0a%3c preserving that uniform deep tint which characterizes the sma- %0a%3c ragdus of Scythia. In other instances, a shadow runs through %0a%3c the stone, aqd the colour becomes dulled thereby ; the conse- %0a%3c quence of which is, that its value is depreciated ; and even %0a%3c more so, when the colour is thin and diluted. %0a%3c %0a%3c In consequence of the defects 33 in these stones, they have %0a%3c been divided into several classes. Some of them are obscure, %0a%3c and are then known as " blind" stones; some have a certain %0a%3c density, which impairs their transparency ; others, again, are %0a%3c mottled, and others covered with a cloud. This cloud, how- %0a%3c ever, is altogether different from the shadow above mentioned ; %0a%3c for it is a defect which renders the stone of a whitish hue, and %0a%3c not of a transparent green throughout ; presenting, as it does, in %0a%3c the interior or upon the surface, a certain degree of whiteness %0a%3c which arrests the vision. Other defects, again, in these stones, %0a%3c are filaments, salt-like 31 grains, or traces of lead ore, faults %0a%3c which are mostly common to them all. %0a%3c %0a%3c Next after the kinds above described, the smaragdus of %0a%3c ^Ethiopia is held in high esteem ; being found, as Juba tells %0a%3c us, at a distance of twenty-five days' journey from Coptos. %0a%3c These are of a bright green, but are seldom to be met with per- %0a%3c fectly clear or of an uniform colour. Democritus includes in %0a%3c this class the stones that are known as " herminei," and as %0a%3c " Persian" stones ; the former of which are of a convex, %0a%3c %0a%3c 33 Ajasson remarks that the greater part of the defects here described %0a%3c belong in reality to the Dioptase. %0a%3c 31 " Sal."

In the sun, he says, they lose their %0a%3c brilliancy, but they are radiant in the shade, the brightness of %0a%3c them being seen at a greater distance than in the case of other %0a%3c stones. One other fault, too, in all these stones is, that they %0a%3c often have a colour like that of honey or rancid oil, or else %0a%3c are clear and transparent, but not green. %0a%3c %0a%3c These defects exist in the smaragdi of Attica, 35 more par- %0a%3c ticularly, which are found in the silver-mines there, at a place %0a%3c known by the name of Thoricos. 36 These last are never so %0a%3c massive as the others, and are always more pleasing to the %0a%3c sight when viewed from a distance : lead ore, too, is often to %0a%3c be detected in them, or, in other words, they have a leaden %0a%3c appearance when looked at in the sun. 37 One peculiarity in %0a%3c them is, that some of them become impaired by age, gradually %0a%3c lose their green colour, and are even deteriorated by expo- %0a%3c sure to the sun. Next to the stones of Attica come those of %0a%3c Media, a variety which presents the most numerous tints of all, %0a%3c and sometimes approaches sapphiros 38 in colour. These stones %0a%3c are wavy, 39 and represent various natural objects, such as %0a%3c poppy-heads, for example, birds, the young of animals, and %0a%3c feathers : all of them appear naturally of a green colour, but %0a%3c become improved by the application of oil. No stones of this %0a%3c species are of a larger size than these. %0a%3c %0a%3c I am not aware that any of these stones 40 are still in exist- %0a%3c ence at Chalcedon, the copper mines of that locality being now %0a%3c exhausted : but be this as it may, they were always the smallest %0a%3c in size and the most inferior in value.

There was another defect, also, %0a%3c peculiar to these stones, known as " sarcion," from the circum- %0a%3c stance that a kind of flesh 41 appeared to attach itself to the %0a%3c stone. The mountain near Chalcedon, where these stones were %0a%3c gathered, is still known by the name of " Smaragdites."

On the %0a%3c same authority, too, we learn that there are several varieties %0a%3c of the smaragdus in the neighbouring mountains, and that %0a%3c stones like those of Media are found in Mount Taygetus, 43 as %0a%3c also in Sicily. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 19.

BERYLS : EIGHT VARIETIES OF THEM. DEFECTS IN %0a%3c %0a%3c BERYLS. %0a%3c %0a%3c Beryls, it is thought, are of the same 50 nature as the smarag- %0a%3c dus, or at least closely analogous. India 61 produces them, and %0a%3c they are rarely to be found elsewhere. The lapidaries cut all %0a%3c beryls of an hexagonal 53 form ; because the colour, which is %0a%3c deadened by a dull uniformity of surface, is heightened by the %0a%3c reflection resulting from the angles. If they are cut in any %0a%3c other way, these stones have no brilliancy whatever. The most %0a%3c esteemed beryls are those which in colour resemble the pure %0a%3c green of the sea ; 53 the chrysoberyP 1 being next in value, a stone %0a%3c of a somewhat paler colour, but approaching a golden tint. %0a%3c Closely allied to this last in its brilliancy, but of a more pallid %0a%3c %0a%3c 47 Herodotus mentions tbis smaragdus and the temple, B. ii. c. 44, as %0a%3c having been seen by himself. %0a%3c %0a%3c 48 " Iaspis."

See end of B. xxx. %0a%3c %0a%3c 60 The Beryl and the Emerald are only varieties of the same species, the %0a%3c latter owing its colour to oxide of chrome, the former to oxide of iron. %0a%3c %0a%3c 51 The best Beryls are found in Siberia, Hindostan, Brazil, and the %0a%3c United States. %0a%3c %0a%3c 6 - The crystals are naturally hexagonal. %0a%3c %0a%3c 53 Hence the name of the sky-blue, or mountain-green beryl, aqua- %0a%3c marine. %0a%3c %0a%3c 54 Or " golden beryl." The modern Chrysoberyl is altogether a differ- %0a%3c ent stone from the one here described, which probably is identical with %0a%3c Chrysoprase or leek-green Chalcedony, the stone next mentioned. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 21.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 0PAL8. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 415 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c colour, and thought by some to constitute a separate genus, is %0a%3c chrysoprasus. 55 In the fourth rank are reckoned the hyacin- %0a%3c thine beryls ; and in the fifth, those known as " aeroides." 50 %0a%3c Next, we have the wax-coloured beryls, and, after them, the %0a%3c oleaginous beryls, so called from the resemblance of their colour %0a%3c to that of oil. Last of all, there are the stones which closely %0a%3c resemble crystal in appearance ; mostly disfigured by spots and %0a%3c filaments, and of a poor, faint, colour as well ; all of them so %0a%3c many imperfections in the stone. %0a%3c %0a%3c The people of India are marvellously fond of beryls of an %0a%3c elongated 67 form, and say that these are the only precious stones %0a%3c they prefer wearing without the addition of gold : hence it is %0a%3c that, after piercing them, they string them upon the bristles of %0a%3c the elephant. It is generally agreed, however, that those %0a%3c stones should not be perforated which are of the finest quality; %0a%3c and in this case they only enclose the extremities of them in %0a%3c studs of gold. They prefer, too, cutting the beryls in a cylin- %0a%3c drical form, instead of setting them as precious stones ; an elon- %0a%3c gated shape being the one that is most highly esteemed. Some %0a%3c are of opinion that beryls are naturally angular, 58 and that %0a%3c when pierced they become improved in colour ; the white sub- %0a%3c stance being thus removed that lies within, and their brilliancy %0a%3c heightened by the reflection of the gold in which they are set ; %0a%3c or, at all events, their transparency being increased by this %0a%3c diminution in their thickness. In addition to the defects %0a%3c already 69 mentioned, and which are pretty nearly the same as %0a%3c those to which the smaragdus is subject, beryls are affected with %0a%3c cloudy spots, 60 like those on the finger-nails in appearance. In %0a%3c our own part of the world, it is thought that they are sometimes %0a%3c fbund in the countries that lie in the vicinity of Pontus. 61 The %0a%3c people of India, by colouring crystal, have found a method of %0a%3c imitating various precious stones, beryls in particular. %0a%3c %0a%3c chap. 21.

In size, the opal is about as large as a hazel-nut, 00 and, %0a%3c with reference to it, there is a remarkable historical anecdote %0a%3c related. For there is still in existence a stone of this class, on %0a%3c account of which Antonius proscribed the senator Nonius, son %0a%3c of the Nonius Struma, whom the poet Catullus 67 was so dis- %0a%3c pleased at seeing in the curule chair, and grandfather of the %0a%3c Servilius Nonianus, who in our own times was consul. 68 On %0a%3c being thus proscribed, Nonius took to flight, carrying with %0a%3c him, out of all his wealth, nothing but this ring, the value of %0a%3c which, it is well known, was estimated at two millions of ses- %0a%3c terces. How marvellous must have been the cruelty, how mar- %0a%3c vellous the luxurious passion of Antonius, thus to proscribe a %0a%3c man for the possession of a jewel ! and no less marvellous must %0a%3c have been the obstinacy of Nonius, who could thus dote upon %0a%3c what had been the cause of his proscription ; for we see the %0a%3c very brutes even tear off the portion of their body for the sake %0a%3c of which they know their existence to be imperilled, 69 and so %0a%3c redeem themselves by parting with it. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 22.

There is less certainty with respect to %0a%3c those upon which the men as well have been left to form a %0a%3c judgment; seeing that the value of each stone depends more %0a%3c particularly upon the caprice of the individual and the rivalry %0a%3c that exists in reference thereto ; as, for example, when Claudius %0a%3c Caesar was so much in the habit of wearing the smaragdus and %0a%3c the sardonyx. 74 The first Roman who wore a sardonyx, ac- %0a%3c cording to Demostratus, was the elder Africanus, since whose %0a%3c %0a%3c 71 This is the case with common opal, as distinguished from precious opal. %0a%3c " " Lovely youth." , . _ %0a%3c %0a%3c 73 Said ironically.

Such, according to Ismenias, Deraostratus, %0a%3c Zenothemis, and Sotacus, is the sardonyx of India ; the last %0a%3c two giving the name of " blind" sardonyx to all the other %0a%3c stones of this class which are not transparent, and which have %0a%3c now entirely appropriated the name to themselves. For, at %0a%3c the present day, the Arabian sardonyx presents no traces what- %0a%3c ever of the Indian sarda, 76 it being a stone that has been found %0a%3c to be characterized by several different colours of late ; black %0a%3c or azure for the base, and vermilion, surrounded with a line of %0a%3c rich white, for the upper part, not without a certain glimpse 71 %0a%3c of purple as the white passes into the red. 78 %0a%3c %0a%3c We learn from Zenothemis that in his time these stones %0a%3c were not held by the people of India in any high esteem, al- %0a%3c though they are found there of so large a size as to admit of %0a%3c the hilts of swords being made of them. It is well known, too, %0a%3c that in that country they are exposed to view by the mountain- %0a%3c streams, and that in our part of the world they were formerly %0a%3c valued from the fact that they are nearly the only ones 79 among %0a%3c the engraved precious stones that do not bring away the wax %0a%3c when an impression is made. The consequence is, that our %0a%3c example has at last taught the people of India to set a value %0a%3c upon them, and the lower classes there now pierce them even, %0a%3c to wear them as ornaments for the neck ; the great proof, in %0a%3c fact, at the present day, of a sardonyx being of Indian origin. %0a%3c Those of Arabia are remarkable for their marginal line of %0a%3c brilliant white, of considerable breadth, and not glistening in %0a%3c hollow fissures in the stone or upon the sides, but shining upon %0a%3c the very surface, at the margin, and supported by a ground %0a%3c intensely black beneath.

ONYX : THE SEVERAL VARIETIES OF IT. %0a%3c %0a%3c We must give some account also of onyx, 83 because of %0a%3c the name which it partly shares in common with sardonyx. %0a%3c This name, though in some places 84 given to a marble, is %0a%3c here used to signify a precious stone. Sudines says, that in this %0a%3c stone there is a white portion which resembles the white of %0a%3c the human-fingernail, in addition to the colours of chrysolithos, %0a%3c sarda, and iaspis. According to Zenothemis, there are numerous %0a%3c varieties of the Indian onyx, the fiery- coloured, the black, and %0a%3c the cornel, with white veins encircling them, like an eye as it %0a%3c were, and in some cases running across them obliquely. 85 %0a%3c Sotacus mentions an Arabian onyx, which differs from the rest. ; %0a%3c that of India, according to him, presenting small flames, 86 each %0a%3c surrounded by one or more white zones ; in a manner altogether %0a%3c different from the Indian sardonyx, which presents a series of %0a%3c white specks, while in this case it is one continuous circle. %0a%3c The Arabian onyx, on the other hand, is black, he says, with a %0a%3c white zone encircling it. %0a%3c %0a%3c Satyrus says, that there is an onyx in India of a flesh %0a%3c %0a%3c 80 A variety, probably, of common Chalcedony. %0a%3c « See B. ix. cc. 74, 88, and B. xxxii. c. 53. %0a%3c 82 « Ffficulenta;," of the colour of wine-lees. %0a%3c %0a%3c m So called from vwK, a "finger-nail."

The real onyx, according to him, has numerous %0a%3c veins of variegated colours, interspersed with others of a milk- %0a%3c white hue ; the shades of which, as they pass into one another, %0a%3c produce a tint which surpasses all description, and blends itself %0a%3c into one harmonious whole, of a most beautiful appearance. %0a%3c %0a%3c Not unlike sardonyx, too, is sarda, 88 a stone which also has, %0a%3c in part, a kindred name with it ; but before passing on to it, %0a%3c we must first take some notice of all those precious stones which %0a%3c have a brilliancy like that of flame. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 25. (7.) — CARBUNCULUS : TWELVE VARIETIE8 OF IT. %0a%3c %0a%3c In the first rank among these is carbunculus, 89 so called from %0a%3c its resemblance to fire ; though in reality it is proof against the %0a%3c action of that element : 90 hence it is that some persons call %0a%3c these stones "acaustoi." 91 There are various kinds of carbun- %0a%3c culus, the Indian and the Garam antic, for example, which last %0a%3c has been also called the Carchedonian, 92 in compliment to the %0a%3c former opulence of Great Carthage. 93 To these are added the %0a%3c ^Ethiopian and the Alabandic stones, the latter of which are %0a%3c found at Orthosia 94 in Caria, but are cut and polished at Ala- %0a%3c banda. 93 In addition to this, each kind is subdivided into the %0a%3c male carbunculus and the female, the former of which is of a %0a%3c %0a%3c 87 " Carnosas." It is somewhat doubtful whether our Carnelian, or %0a%3c Cornelian, take its name from this word, or from "cornus," a cornel-berry. %0a%3c %0a%3c 83 See Chapter 31. %0a%3c %0a%3c 89 Literally meaning a " red-hot coal." The carbunculus of Pliny is %0a%3c supposed to include not only the red, or Iron and Iron-lime garnet, but %0a%3c the Spinelle ruby also, or Oriental ruby. %0a%3c %0a%3c 90 There is some truth in this, as some few kinds both of the Garnet and %0a%3c Ruby are infusible. Of the ruby, the red varieties change to brown, black, %0a%3c and opaque even, as the temperature increases, and on cooling become first %0a%3c green, and then nearly colourless, but at last resume their red colour. %0a%3c %0a%3c 91 From the Greek; meaning " incombustible." %0a%3c %0a%3c 92 From Kapx^w , the Greek name for Carthage. %0a%3c %0a%3c 93 Carthago Magna, so called in contradistinction to Carthage Nova, or %0a%3c New Carthage, in Spain. 9 * See B. v. c. 29. %0a%3c %0a%3c 95 In the vicinity of Orthosia. It is from this place that one kind of %0a%3c garnet is now called " Almandine." There is also the Almandiue, or %0a%3c violet-coloured ruby. See Beckmann, Hist. Inv. Vol. II. p. 238. Bohris %0a%3c Edition. It is probable that Carthage was the great entrepot for the car- %0a%3c bunculi of the Garamantes and JStbiopia, where Red sapphire, Red corun- %0a%3c dum, or Oriental ruby, was probably found. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 25.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c CABBUNCULUS. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 421 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c more striking brilliancy, the brightness of the latter being not %0a%3c so strong. In the male varieties too, we see some in which %0a%3c the fire is clearer than in others ; while some, again, are of a %0a%3c darker 96 hue, or else have their brilliancy more deeply seated, %0a%3c and shine with a more powerful lustre than others when viewed %0a%3c in the sun. %0a%3c %0a%3c The most highly esteemed, however, is the amethyst- %0a%3c coloured 97 stone, the fire at the extremity of which closely %0a%3c approaches the violet tint of amethystos : next in value to %0a%3c which, are the stones known as " syrtites," radiant with a %0a%3c wavy, feathery, 98 refulgenee. They are found more particu- %0a%3c larly, it is said, where the reflection is most powerful of the %0a%3c rays of the sun. Satyrus says that the carbunculus 98 * of India %0a%3c has no lustre, that it is mostly soiled, and that in all cases its %0a%3c brilliancy is of a tawny complexion. The ^Ethiopian stones, %0a%3c he says, are dense, emit no lustre, and burn with a concentrated %0a%3c flame. According to Callistratus, the refulgence of this stone %0a%3c should be of a whitish hue, and, when placed upon a table, it %0a%3c should heighten by its lustre other stones placed near it that %0a%3c are clouded at the edge. Hence it is, that many writers speak %0a%3c of this stone as the white carbunculus, while the Indian stone, %0a%3c with its comparatively feeble lustre, is known by the name of %0a%3c " lignyzon." 99 The Carchedonian stones, they say, are of much %0a%3c smaller size than the others ; but those of India admit of being %0a%3c hollowed out, and making vessels that will hold as much as %0a%3c one sextarius 1 even. %0a%3c %0a%3c According to Archelaus, the Carchedonian carbunculus is of %0a%3c a more swarthy appearance than the others, but, when exposed %0a%3c to the light of the fire or sun, and viewed obliquely, the bril- %0a%3c liancy of it is much more intense than that of the rest. He says, %0a%3c too, that this stone, when overshadowed by a roof, has a purple %0a%3c tint ; that when viewed in the open air, it is of a flame colour ; %0a%3c %0a%3c 94 A variety, perhaps, of Iron garnet, or Iron-lime garnet. %0a%3c %0a%3c 97 Desfontaines suggests that this may have been the Balas ruby, or %0a%3c possibly the Syrian Garnet, of a violet purple colour. Not improbably it %0a%3c is the Almandine ruby. %0a%3c %0a%3c 98 " Pinnato fulgore." This mottled appearance is to be seen in the %0a%3c interior of some red garnets. 9b * Common garnets, probably. %0a%3c %0a%3c 99 Sillig suggests that this may be from Xtyvig, " soot." The reading, %0a%3c however, is extremely doubtful. %0a%3c %0a%3c 1 See Introduction to Vol. III.

Many authors have asserted that the %0a%3c Indian stones are paler than the Carchedonian, and that, quite %0a%3c the converse of these last, they are all the less brilliant when %0a%3c viewed obliquely; as also, that in the male Carchedonian stone %0a%3c there are luminous points like stars within, while, in the case %0a%3c of the female stone, the whole of its refulgence is thrown be- %0a%3c yond it. The stones of Alabanda too, it is said, are darker than %0a%3c the other kinds, and rough on the surface. In the vicinity %0a%3c also of Miletus, there are stones of this description found in the %0a%3c earth, resembling those of Alabanda in colour, and proof against %0a%3c the action of fire. %0a%3c %0a%3c According to Theophrastus, 2 these stones are to be found also %0a%3c at Orchomenus in Arcadia and in the Isle of Chios ; 3 the former 4 %0a%3c of which are of a darker hue, and are used for making mirrors. %0a%3c He says too, that at Trcezen they are found of various colours %0a%3c and mottled with white spots, those found at Corinth being %0a%3c of a more pallid, whitish, hue. He states also, that they are %0a%3c sometimes imported from Massilia. Bocchus informs us in his %0a%3c writings, that these stones are extracted from the ground at %0a%3c Olisipo ; 5 at the cost of great labour, however, in consequence %0a%3c of the parched, argillaceous, nature of the soil. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 26. DEFECTS IN CARBUNCUXUS, AND THE MODE OF %0a%3c %0a%3c TESTING IT. %0a%3c %0a%3c Nothing is more difficult than to distinguish the several %0a%3c varieties of this stone, so great an opportunity do they afford %0a%3c to artistic skill of compelling them to reflect the colours of %0a%3c substances placed beneath. It is possible, they say, to heighten %0a%3c the brilliancy of dull stones, by steeping them for fourteen %0a%3c days in vinegar, this adventitious lustre being retained by them %0a%3c %0a%3c 2 De Lapid. sec 61. %0a%3c %0a%3c 3 " Pliny has here committed a gross mistake, which has not been ob- %0a%3c served by Hardouin. Theophrastus, in the passage alluded to, does not %0a%3c speak of a ruby, but the well-known black marble of Chio ; though he %0a%3c calls both carbunculus, a name given to the ruby, on account of its likeness %0a%3c to a burning coal, and to the black marble on account of its resemblance %0a%3c to a quenched coal or cinder; and the latter, as well as the Obsidian stone, %0a%3c was sometimes used for mirrors." — Beckmann, Hist.

They are counterfeited, too, with great exact- %0a%3c ness in glass ; but the difference may be detected with the %0a%3c touchstone ; the same being the case also with other artificial %0a%3c stones, as the material is always of a softer nature and com- %0a%3c paratively brittle. When thus tested by the stone, hard knots, %0a%3c too, are detected in them ; and the weight of the glass counter- %0a%3c feit is always less. In some cases, too, they present small blisters %0a%3c within, which shine like silver. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 27. ANTHEACIT1S. %0a%3c %0a%3c There is also a fossil stone found in Thesprotia, known as %0a%3c " anthracitis," 7 and resembling a burning coaP in appearance. %0a%3c Those who have stated that it is a native also of Liguria, are %0a%3c mistaken, in my opinion, unless perhaps it was to be found %0a%3c there in their time. Some of these stones, they say, are sur- %0a%3c rounded with a vein of white. Like those which we have %0a%3c mentioned above, they have a fiery colour, but there is this %0a%3c peculiarity in them, that when thrown into the fire they have all %0a%3c the appearance of becoming quenched and deadened ; while, on %0a%3c the other hand, if they are drenched with water, they become %0a%3c doubly glowing. 9 %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 28. SANDASTEOS. SANDABESOS. %0a%3c %0a%3c Of a kindred nature, too, is sandastros, 10 known as "gar- %0a%3c amantites" by some : it is found in India, at a place of that %0a%3c name, and is a product also of the southern parts of Arabia. %0a%3c The great recommendation of it is, that it has all the appearance %0a%3c of fire placed behind a transparent substance, it burning with %0a%3c star-like scintillations within, that resemble drops of gold, and %0a%3c %0a%3c 6 Dalechamps thinks that this is the same as the " anthracites " men- %0a%3c tioned in B. xxxvi. c. 38, and identifies it either with our Anthracite, or %0a%3c else with pit-coal or bituminous coal. It is much more likely, however, %0a%3c that a precious stone is meant; and, in conformity with this opinion, Brotero %0a%3c and Ajasson have identified it with the Spinelle or scarlet Ruby, and the %0a%3c Balas or rose-red ruby, magnesiates of alumina. 7 See B. iv. c. 1. %0a%3c %0a%3c * "Carbo." This word may mean either a "burning coal" or "char- %0a%3c coal," hence the confusion that has arisen in identifying the mineral %0a%3c substance that is meant. 8 See Note 90, to Chapter 25. %0a%3c %0a%3c io »' Sandaresus " and "Sandasiros" are other readings. This stone %0a%3c has not been identified, but Ajasson is inclined to think that it may have %0a%3c been Aventurine quartz, and is the more inclined to this opinion, as that %0a%3c mineral is found in Persia, and sandastra or tchandastra is purely a San- %0a%3c scrit word. The description, however, would hardly seem to apply to %0a%3c Aventurine. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 424 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c PLINY'S NATURAL HI8T0RT. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Hook xxxvii. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c are always to be seen in the body of the stone, and never upon %0a%3c the surface. There are certain religious associations, too, con- %0a%3c nected with this stone, in consequence of the affinity which it %0a%3c is supposed to bear with the stars ; these scintillations being %0a%3c mostly, In number and arrangement, like the constellations of %0a%3c the Pleiades and Hyades ; a circumstance which had led to the %0a%3c use of it by the Chaldaei in the ceremonials which they practise. %0a%3c %0a%3c Here, too, the male stones are distinguished from the female, %0a%3c by their comparative depth of colour and the vigorousness of %0a%3c the tints which they impart to objects near them : indeed the %0a%3c stones of -India, it is said, quite dim the sight by their brilliancy. %0a%3c The flame of the female sandastros is of a more softened nature, %0a%3c and maybe pronounced to be lustrous rather than brilliant. %0a%3c Some prefer the stone of Arabia to that of India, and say that %0a%3c this last bears a considerable resemblance to a smoke-coloured %0a%3c chrysolithos. Ismenias asserts that sandastros, in consequence %0a%3c of its extreme softness, will not admit of being polished, a %0a%3c circumstance which makes it sell all 11 the dearer : other writers, %0a%3c again, call these stones " sandrisitse." One point upon which %0a%3c all the authorities are agreed is, that the greater the number %0a%3c of stars upon the stone, the more costly it is in price. %0a%3c %0a%3c The similarity of the name has sometimes caused this stone to be %0a%3c confounded with that known as "sandaresos," and which Nican- %0a%3c der calls "sandaserion," and others "sandaseron." Some, again, %0a%3c call this last-mentioned stone " sandastros," and the former one %0a%3c " sandaresos." The stone 12 that is thus mentioned by Nicander, %0a%3c is a native of India as well as the other, and likewise takes %0a%3c its name from the locality where it is found. The colour of %0a%3c it is that of an apple, or of green oil, and no one sets any %0a%3c value on it. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 29.

Brotero is of opinion %0a%3c that this is the Cherry-coloured ruby, that the Ionian stone is the Purple %0a%3c ruby, and that the kermes-berry coloured stone is the Scarlet or Spinelle %0a%3c ruby. From the distinct reference made to its electric nature, Ajasson %0a%3c identifies it with Tourmaline, a Silicate of alumina. Beckmann is of the %0a%3c same opinion ; Hist. Inv. Vol. I. p. 88.

It is found in the vicinity of %0a%3c Orthosia, throughout the whole of Caria, and in the neighbour- %0a%3c ing localities ; but the most approved stones are those that %0a%3c come from India. Some writers have given the name of " dead- %0a%3c ened" 14 carbunculus to a lychnis of second-rate quality, and %0a%3c similar in colour to the flower known as the " flower of Jove." ,s %0a%3c I find other varieties also mentioned, one with a purple radiance, %0a%3c and another of a scarlet 1 " tint.

When %0a%3c certain quarries are being worked, these stones are found, %0a%3c adhering, like a kind of heart, to the interior of the rock. This %0a%3c mineral, however, is said to be now extinct in Persia ; though %0a%3c it is to be found in numerous other localities, Paros and Assos, %0a%3c for example. %0a%3c %0a%3c In India 22 there are three varieties of this stone ; the red %0a%3c sarda, the one known as "pionia," from its thickness, and a third %0a%3c kind, beneath which they place a ground of silver tinsel. The %0a%3c Indian stones are transparent, those of Arabia being more %0a%3c opaque. There are some found also in the vicinity of Leucas %0a%3c in Epirus, and in Egypt, which have a ground placed beneath %0a%3c them of leaf gold. In the case of this stone, too, the male %0a%3c stone shines with a more attractive brilliancy than the female, %0a%3c which is of a thicker substance, and more opaque. Among the %0a%3c ancients there was no precious stone in more common use than %0a%3c this ; at all events, it is this stone that is made so much parade %0a%3c of in the comedies of Menander and Philemon. No one, too, %0a%3c among the transparent stones is tarnished more speedily by ex- %0a%3c posure to moisture than this ; though of all liquids, it is oil %0a%3c that acts the most readily upon it. Those stones which are %0a%3c like honey in colour, are generally disapproved of, and still %0a%3c more so, when they have the complexion of earthenware. 23 %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 32. (8.) — topazos: TWO varieties of it. %0a%3c %0a%3c Topazos 24 is a stone that is still held in very high estimation %0a%3c for its green tints : indeed, when it was first discovered, it was %0a%3c preferred to every other kind of precious stone. It so happened %0a%3c that some Troglodytic pirates, suffering from tempest and %0a%3c hunger, having landed upon an island off the coast of Arabia %0a%3c known as Cytis, 25 when digging there for roots and grasn, %0a%3c discovered this precious stone : such, at least, is the opinion %0a%3c %0a%3c red, which afterwards turns to a rich, deep, red, on exposure to the sun's %0a%3c rays, and subsequently to artificial heat. %0a%3c %0a%3c 22 Which supplies the best carnelians at the present day. %0a%3c %0a%3c 23 From their mixture, Ajasson says, with argillaceous earth. %0a%3c %0a%3c 24 Under this name Pliny evidently speaks of the stone known to us as %0a%3c Chrysolite, and possibly of green agate as well. Our Topaz cannot be %0a%3c easily recognized in this Chapter, at all events. %0a%3c %0a%3c " See B. vi. c. 34. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 33.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c CALLAIKA. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 427 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c expressed by Archelaiis.

He %0a%3c states also, that Philon, the king's praefect, was the first to bring %0a%3c these stones from this island ; that, on his presenting them to %0a%3c Queen Berenice, the mother of the second Ptolemaeus, she was %0a%3c wonderfully pleased with them ; and that, at a later period, a %0a%3c statue, four cubits in height, was made of this stone,- 8 iu honour %0a%3c of Arsinoe, the wife of Ptolemaeus Philadelphus, it being con- %0a%3c secrated in the temple known as the " Golden Temple." %0a%3c %0a%3c The most recent writers say that this stone is found also in %0a%3c the vicinity of Alabastrum, a city of Thebais, and they dis- %0a%3c tinguish two varieties of it, the prasoides 29 and the chrysop- %0a%3c teron ; 30 which last is similar to chrysoprasu8, 3, all the shades of it %0a%3c tending, more or less, to resemble the colouring principle of %0a%3c the leek. Topazos is the largest of all the precious stones, %0a%3c and is the only one among those of high value that yields to %0a%3c the action of the file, the rest being polished by the aid of %0a%3c stone of Naxos. 32 It admits, too, of being worn by use. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 33.

People so habituated as they are to riding %0a%3c on horseback, cannot find the energy and dexterity requisite %0a%3c for climbing the rocks to obtain the stones, while, at the same %0a%3c time, they are quite terrified at the danger of doing so. Hence %0a%3c it is, that they attack the stones with slings from a distance, %0a%3c and so bring them down, moss and all. It is with this stone %0a%3c that the people pay their tribute, and this the rich look upon %0a%3c as their most graceful ornament for the neck. 35 This constitutes %0a%3c the whole of their wealth, with some, and it is their chief %0a%3c glory to recount how many of these stones they have brought %0a%3c down from the mountain heights since the days of their child- %0a%3c hood. Their success, however, is extremely variable; 36 for while %0a%3c some, at the very first throw, have brought down remarkably %0a%3c fine specimens, many have arrived at old age without obtaining %0a%3c any. %0a%3c %0a%3c Such is the method of procuring these stones ; their form %0a%3c being given them by cutting, a thing that is easily effected. %0a%3c The best of them have just the colour of smaragdus, a thing %0a%3c that proves that the most pleasing property in them is one that %0a%3c belongs of right to another stone. Their beauty is heightened %0a%3c by setting them in gold, and there is no stone to which the %0a%3c contrast of the gold is more becoming. The finest of them lose %0a%3c their colour by coming in contact with oil, unguents, or undi- %0a%3c luted wine even ; whereas those of a poorer quality preserve %0a%3c their colour better.

To all these stones %0a%3c chrysoprasus 40 is preferred, which is also similar to the colouring %0a%3c matter of the leek, but varies in tint between topazos and gold. %0a%3c This stone is found of so large a size as to admit of drinking- %0a%3c boats 41 even being made of it, and is cut into cylinders very %0a%3c frequently. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 35. — NILION. %0a%3c %0a%3c India, which produces these stones, produces nilion 42 also, a %0a%3c stone that differs from the last in its dull, diminished lustre, %0a%3c which, when steadily looked upon, soon fades from the sight. %0a%3c Sudines says that it is to be found also in the Siberus, a river of %0a%3c Attica. In appearance it resembles a smoke-coloured topazos, or, %0a%3c in some cases, a topazos with a tint like honey. According to %0a%3c Juba, Ethiopia produces it, upon the shores of the river known %0a%3c to us as the Nilus ; to which circumstance, he says, it owes its %0a%3c name. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 36. MOLOCHITIS. %0a%3c %0a%3c Molochitis 43 is not transparent, being of a deeper green, and %0a%3c more opaque than smaragdus ; its name is derived from the %0a%3c mallow, 44 which it resembles in colour. It is highly esteemed %0a%3c for making seals, and it is endowed by Nature with medicinal %0a%3c properties which render it a preservative for infants against %0a%3c certain dangers which menace them.

DEFECTS FOUND %0a%3c IN IASPIS. %0a%3c %0a%3c Iaspis, 48 too, is green, and often transparent ; a stone which, if %0a%3c surpassed hy many others, still retains the renown which it %0a%3c acquired in former times. Many countries produce this stone : %0a%3c that of India is like smaragdus in colour ; that of Cyprus 13 %0a%3c hard, and of a full sea-green ; and that of Persia is sky-blue, %0a%3c whence its name, " aerizusa." 47 Similar to this last is the %0a%3c Caspian iaspis. On the banks of the river Thermodon the %0a%3c iaspis is of an azure colour ; in Phrygia, it is purple ; and m %0a%3c Cappadocia of an azure purple, sombre, and not refulgent. %0a%3c Amisos 48 sends us an iaspis like that of India in colour, and %0a%3c Chalcedon, 49 a stone of a turbid hue. %0a%3c %0a%3c But it is of less consequence to distinguish the several loca- %0a%3c lities that furnish it, than it is to remark upon the degrees of %0a%3c excellence which they present. The best kind is that which %0a%3c has a shade of purple, the next best being the rose-coloured, %0a%3c and the next the stone with the green colour of the smaragdus ; %0a%3c to each of which the Greeks have given names 50 according to %0a%3c their respective tints. A fourth kind, which is called by them %0a%3c " boria," 51 resembles in colour the sky of a morning in autumn ; %0a%3c this, too, will be the same that is known as " aerizusa."" There %0a%3c is an iaspis also which resembles sarda 53 in appearance, and %0a%3c another with a violet tint. Not less numerous, too, are the %0a%3c other kinds that are left undescribed ; but they are all blue to %0a%3c a fault, 54 or else resemble crystal in appearance, or the tints of %0a%3c the myxa 55 plum. There is the terebenthine^-coloured iaspis %0a%3c also ; improperly so called, in my opinion, as it has all the ap- %0a%3c pearance of being a composition of numerous gems of this de- %0a%3c scription. %0a%3c %0a%3c The best of these stones are set in an open bezel, the gold of %0a%3c %0a%3c 46 Meadow-green jasper %0a%3c %0a%3c 47 Salmasius erroneously takes this to be the Turquoise.

Grains also like salt appear within the %0a%3c stone, and all the other defects which are common 67 to precious %0a%3c stones in general. Sometimes they are imitated in glass ; a fraud, %0a%3c however, which may be easily detected, from the material %0a%3c throwing out its refulgence, instead of concentrating it within %0a%3c itself. To this class also belongs the stone called " Bphragis," 48 %0a%3c which is only reckoned as belonging to the domain of precious %0a%3c stones, from the circumstance that it is the best of all for %0a%3c making signets. 69 %0a%3c %0a%3c (9.) Throughout all the East, it is the custom, it is said, to %0a%3c wear iaspis by way of amulet. The variety of this stone %0a%3c which resembles smaragdus in colour is often found with a %0a%3c white line running transversely through the middle ; in which %0a%3c case it is known as " monogrammos i" 60 when it is streaked %0a%3c with several lines, it is called " polygrammos." 61 Here, too, I %0a%3c may take the opportunity of exposing the falsehoods 62 of the %0a%3c magicians, who pretend that this stone is beneficial for persons %0a%3c when speaking in public. There is a stone also that is formed of %0a%3c iaspis and onyx combined, and is known as " iasponyx." 63 Some- %0a%3c times this stone has a clouded appearance ; sometimes it has %0a%3c spots upon the surface like snow ; 64 and sometimes it is stel- %0a%3c lated with red spots. 68 One kind resembles salt of Megara 66 in %0a%3c appearance, and another is known as capnias, 67 and looks as if %0a%3c it had been smoked.

The best kind is that of %0a%3c Scythia, 70 the next best being the produce of Cyprus, and, last %0a%3c of all, that of Egypt. An artificial 11 kind is much in use, %0a%3c that is prepared by dyeing other substances ; and this inven- %0a%3c tion is looked upon as one of the great glories of the kings %0a%3c of Egypt, the name of the king who first discovered it being %0a%3c still preserved in their annals.

The name which these stones bear, %0a%3c originates, it is said, in the peculiar tint of their brilliancy' %0a%3c which, after closely approaching the colour of wine, passes off %0a%3c into a violet without being fully pronounced : or else, accord- %0a%3c ing to some authorities, in the fact that in their purple there %0a%3c is something that falls short of a fiery colour, the tints fading %0a%3c ofi° and inclining to the colour of wine. %0a%3c %0a%3c All these stones are transparent and of an agreeable violet %0a%3c colour, and are easy 79 to engrave. Those of India have in %0a%3c perfection the very richest shades of purple, and it is to attain %0a%3c this colour that the dyers 77 in purple direct all their endeavours ; %0a%3c it presenting a fine mellowed appearance to the eye, and not %0a%3c dazzling the sight, as in the case with the colours of the carbun- %0a%3c cultis. Another variety approaches more nearly the hyacinth %0a%3c in colour : the people of India call this tint "socon," and the %0a%3c stone itself " socondion." A third stone of this class is of a %0a%3c more diluted colour, and is known as " sapenos," being iden- %0a%3c tical with "pharanitis," so called from a country 7 * on the %0a%3c frontiers of Arabia that produces it. Of a fourth kind, the %0a%3c colour is like that of wine ; and in a fifth it borders very closely %0a%3c upon that of crystal, the purple gradually passing off into %0a%3c white. This last kind is but little valued ; for a fine amethyst %0a%3c should always have, when viewed sideways 79 and held up to the %0a%3c light, a certain purple refulgence, like that of carbunculus, %0a%3c slightly inclining to a tint of rose. %0a%3c %0a%3c Some prefer giving these stones the name of "psederos" 80 or %0a%3c %0a%3c 75 So called, according to some authorities, from r%3c, "not," yuQvu, "to %0a%3c intoxicate," on account of its being a supposed preservative against inebriety. %0a%3c -Ajasson is of opinion that l'liny does not here speaks of the Quartz Ame- %0a%3c thyst of modern mineralogy, but only the Oriental Amethyst, violet Sap- %0a%3c phire, or violet Corundum. It is not improbable, however, that he includes %0a%3c them all, as well as violet Fluor spar, and some other purple stones; inclusive, %0a%3c possibly, of the Garnet. %0a%3c %0a%3c 76 He is probably speaking here of violet Fluor spar; Oriental amethyst, %0a%3c or violet sapphire, it is next to impossible to engrave. 77 SeeB. ix. c. 62. %0a%3c %0a%3c The city of Pharan, mentioned by St. Jerome and Eusebius. %0a%3c 79 " In suspectu."

It is said too, that worn in any %0a%3c manner, this stone will ensure access to the presence of kings ; %0a%3c and that it will avert hail and the attacks of locusts, if a certain %0a%3c prayer is also repeated which they mention. They make similar %0a%3c promises, too, in reference to the smaragdus, if graven with the %0a%3c figure of an eagle or of a scarabseus : statements which, in my %0a%3c opinion, they cannot have committed to writing without a feel- %0a%3c ing of contempt and derision for the rest of mankind. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 41. HYACINTHOS. %0a%3c %0a%3c Very different from this stone is hyacinthos, 85 though par- %0a%3c taking" of a colour that closely borders upon it. The great %0a%3c difference between them is, that the brilliant violet which is %0a%3c so refulgent in the amethystos, is diluted in the other stone. %0a%3c Though pleasing at first sight, its beauty fades before the eye %0a%3c is satiated ; indeed, so far is it from satisfying the sight, that %0a%3c it almost wholly fails to attract the eye, its lustre disappearing %0a%3c more rapidly than the tints of the flower 86 known by the same %0a%3c name. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 42.

The worst in quality are those of Arabia, the %0a%3c colour of them being turbid and mottled, and their brilliancy %0a%3c interrupted by cloudy spots : even too, when they happen to %0a%3c be limpid, they have all the appearance of being full, as it %0a%3c were, of a peculiar dust. The best stones are those which, %0a%3c when placed by the side of gold, impart to it a sort of whitish %0a%3c hue, and so give it the appearance of silver. When this is the %0a%3c case, they are set in a bezel that is open on either side ; but %0a%3c when the stone is of inferior quality, a ground of aurichalcum 89 %0a%3c is placed beneath. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 43. — CHRYSELECTRUM. %0a%3c %0a%3c Though it has now altogether gone out of use for jewellery, %0a%3c there is a precious stone known as "chryselectrum," 90 the colour %0a%3c of which inclines to that of amber; 91 but only when viewed by %0a%3c a morning 92 light. The stones of Pontus are known by their %0a%3c lightness. Some of them are hard and reddish, while others, %0a%3c again, are soft and of a soiled appearance. According to Bocohus, %0a%3c these stones are found in Spain as well; in a spot where, %0a%3c according to him, fossil crystal has been discovered, in sinking %0a%3c to the water-level for wells. 93 He tells us also that he once %0a%3c saw a chrysolithos twelve 94 pounds in weight. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 44.

India produces these stones, and, although hard, they %0a%3c are very brittle, but not unpleasing to the sight. The same %0a%3c country, too, produces xuthon, 98 a stone much used by the lower %0a%3c classes there. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 46. TiEDEROS, SANGKNON, OR TENITES. %0a%3c %0a%3c At the very head of the white stones is psederos though %0a%3c it may still be questionable to which of the colours it in %0a%3c reality belongs. As to the name, it has been so much bandied %0a%3c about among other precious stones of conspicuous beauty, that %0a%3c it has quite assumed the privilege of being a synonymous %0a%3c term 1 for all that is charming to the eye. Still, however, there %0a%3c is one 2 stone in particular which fully merits all the commenda- %0a%3c tion that might be expected for a stone with so prepossessing %0a%3c a name : for in itself it reunites the transparency of crystal, %0a%3c the peculiar green of the sky, the deep tints of purple, %0a%3c and a sort of bright reflex, like that of a golden-coloured %0a%3c wine ; a reflex, indeed, that is always the last to meet %0a%3c the eye, but is always crowned with the lustrous hues of %0a%3c purple. The stone, in fact, has all the appearance of having %0a%3c been bathed in each of these tints, individually, and yet in the %0a%3c whole of them at once. There is no precious stone either that %0a%3c has a clearer water than this, or that presents a more pleasing %0a%3c sweetness to the eye. %0a%3c %0a%3c Psederos of the finest quality comes from India, where it is %0a%3c known as " sangeuon ;" the next best being that of Egypt, %0a%3c called " tenites." That of third-rate quality is found in Arabia, %0a%3c but it is rough upon the surface. Next, we have the stone of %0a%3c Pontus, the radiance of which is softer than in that of Thasos, %0a%3c which, in its turn, is of a more mellowed colour than the %0a%3c stones of Galatia, Thrace, and Cyprus. The defects com- %0a%3c %0a%3c 97 " Honey gold stone." Some are of opinion that this was the Honey- %0a%3c coloured Hyacinth. Others, again, identify it with the yellow, honey- %0a%3c coloured Topaz ; an opinion with which Ajasson coincides. %0a%3c %0a%3c 98 " Xanthon " is another reading.

ASTEEIA. %0a%3c %0a%3c Next among the white stones is " asteria," 1 a gem which %0a%3c holds its high rank on account of a certain peculiarity in its %0a%3c nature, it having a light enclosed within, in the pupil of an %0a%3c eye as it were. This light, which has all the appearance of %0a%3c moving within the stone, it transmits according to the angle of %0a%3c inclination at which it is held ; now in one direction, and %0a%3c now in another. "When held facing the sun, it emits white %0a%3c rays like those of a star, and to this, in fact, it owes its name. 6 %0a%3c The stones of India are very difficult to engrave, those of Car- %0a%3c mania being preferred. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 48. ASTRION. %0a%3c %0a%3c Of a similar white radiance is the stone that is known as %0a%3c "astrion," 6 closely resembling crystal in its nature, and found %0a%3c in India and upon the coasts of Pallene. 7 In the centre of it %0a%3c there shines internally a brilliant star, with a refulgence like %0a%3c that of the moon when full. Some will have it that this stone %0a%3c receives its name from the fact that, when held opposite to the %0a%3c stars, it absorbs the light they emit and then returns it. The %0a%3c finest stones, they say, are those of Carmania, there being %0a%3c none more entirely free from all defects. They add, also, that %0a%3c a stone of inferior quality is known as " ceraunia,'' 8 and that, %0a%3c in the worst of all, the light is very similar to that given by a %0a%3c lamp. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 49. ASTUIOTES. %0a%3c %0a%3c Astriotes, 9 too, is a stone that is highly esteemed, and Zoro- %0a%3c aster, they say, has sung its wondrous praises as an adjunct of %0a%3c the magic art. %0a%3c %0a%3c 3 See Chapter 18 of this Book. %0a%3c %0a%3c 4 The vitreous Asteriated crystals of Sapphire are still called by this %0a%3c name. Ajasson, however, and Desfontaines, identify this gem with Gir- %0a%3c asol opal or fire opal. See Note 60. 5 From danp, a star. %0a%3c %0a%3c 8 «« Star-stone."

CERAUNIA ; FOUR "VARIETIES OF IT. %0a%3c %0a%3c Among the white stones also, there is one known as %0a%3c " ceraunia," 11 which absorbs the brilliancy of the stars. It is %0a%3c of a crystalline formation, of a lustrous azure colour, and is a %0a%3c native of Carmania. Zenothemis admits that it is white, but %0a%3c asserts that it has the figure of a blazing star within. Some of %0a%3c them, he says, are dull, in which case it is the custom to steep %0a%3c them for some days in a mixture of nitre and vinegar ; at the %0a%3c end of which period the star makes its appearance, but gradu- %0a%3c ally dies away by the end of as many months. %0a%3c %0a%3c Sotacus mentions also two other varieties of ceraunia, one %0a%3c black and the other red ; and he says that they resemble axes %0a%3c in shape. Those which are black and round, 12 he says, are %0a%3c looked upon as sacred, and by their assistance cities and fleets %0a%3c are attacked and taken : the name given to them is " bsetyli," %0a%3c those of an elongated form being known as " ceraunise." 13 They %0a%3c make out also that there is another kind, rarely to be met with, %0a%3c and much in request for the practices of magic, it never being %0a%3c found in any place but one that has been struck by lightning. 11 %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 52. — IRIS ; TWO VARIETIES OF IT. %0a%3c %0a%3c The next name mentioned by these authors is that of the %0a%3c stone called " iris;" 15 which is found, in a fossil state, in a %0a%3c certain island of the Eed Sea, forty miles distant from the city %0a%3c %0a%3c 10 " Planet-stricken." It is not improbable tbat tbis was Cafs-eye, a %0a%3c translucent Chalcedony, presenting a peculiar opalescence, or internal re- %0a%3c flections, when cut en cabochon. The colour is either bright-greenish grey, %0a%3c or else yellow, red, or brownish. %0a%3c %0a%3c 11 See Note 8 above. Parisot thinks that these must have been %0a%3c Aerolites or Meteorites. %0a%3c %0a%3c 12 Brotero thinks that these were petrified shells, to which the magicians %0a%3c imputed marvellous properties. %0a%3c %0a%3c 13 Brotero is of opinion that those were Belemnites, more commonly %0a%3c known as "thunderstones." The reading "baetyli " is doubtful ; but Par- %0a%3c isot says, on what authority does not appear, that " Betylus " meant " Great %0a%3c father," and that this name, as well as " Abaddir " of similar significa- %0a%3c tion, was given by magicians to aerolites or meteorites used in their en- %0a%3c shantments. 14 A meteoric stone or aerolite, evidently. %0a%3c %0a%3c 15 " Rainbow."

It is partly composed of crystal, and hence it is %0a%3c that some have called it " root of crystal/' It takes its name %0a%3c "iris" from the properties which it possesses; for, when %0a%3c struck by the rays of the sun in a covered spot, it projects upon %0a%3c the nearest walls the form and diversified colours of the rain- %0a%3c bow ; continually changing its tints, and exciting admiration %0a%3c by the great variety of colours which it presents. That it is %0a%3c hexahedral in form, like crystal, is generally agreed; but some %0a%3c say that it is rough on the sides and of unequal angles ; %0a%3c and that, when exposed to a full sun, it disperses the rays %0a%3c that are thrown upon it, while at the same time, by throw- %0a%3c ing out a certain brightness 16 before it, it illumines all ob- %0a%3c jects that may happen to be adjacent. The stone, however, %0a%3c as already stated, only presents these colours when under %0a%3c cover ; not as though they were in the body of the stone %0a%3c itself, but, to all appearance, as if they were the result of the %0a%3c reflected light upon the surface of the wall. The best kind is %0a%3c the one that produces the largest arcs, with the closest resem- %0a%3c blance to the rainbow. %0a%3c %0a%3c " Iritis " is the name of another stone, similar to the last in %0a%3c all other respects, but remarkable for its extreme hardness. %0a%3c Horus says, in his writings, that this stone, calcined and tritu- %0a%3c rated, is a remedy for the bite of the ichneumon, and that it is %0a%3c a native of Persia. %0a%3c %0a%3c chap. 53. — LEROS. %0a%3c The stone called "leros" 17 is similar in appearance, but does %0a%3c not produce the same effects.

[Book XXXVII. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c according to their respective colours, I shall proceed to mention %0a%3c the rest of them in their alphabetical order. %0a%3c %0a%3c (10.) Achates 18 was a stone formerly in high esteem, but %0a%3c now held in none. It was first found in Sicily, near a river %0a%3c of that name ; but has since been discovered in numerous other %0a%3c localities. In size it exceeds any other stones of this class, %0a%3c and the varieties of it are numerous, the name varying accord- %0a%3c ingly. Thus, for example, we have iaspachates, 1 ' cerachates, 20 %0a%3c smaragdachates, 21 haemachates, 22 leucaehates, 23 dendrachates, 21 %0a%3c marked with small shrubs, as it were ; autachates, 25 which when %0a%3c burnt has a smell like that of myrrh ; and coralloachates,* %0a%3c spotted all over, like sapphiros, with drops of gold, and com- %0a%3c monly found in Crete, where it is also known as " sacred" %0a%3c achates. This last, it is thought, is good for wounds inflicted %0a%3c by spiders and scorpions ; a property which I could really %0a%3c believe to belong to the stones of Sicily, for, the moment they %0a%3c breathe the air of that province, scorpions lose their venom. %0a%3c %0a%3c The stones, too, that are found in India are possessed of %0a%3c similar properties, and of other great and marvellous properties %0a%3c as well ; for they present the appearance in them of rivers, 27 %0a%3c woods, 28 beasts of burden, and forms even, like ivy 29 and the %0a%3c trappings of horses. Medical men, too, make grinding-hones 30 %0a%3c of these stones, and indeed the very sight of them is beneficial %0a%3c for the eyes : held in the mouth, they allay thirst. Those %0a%3c found in Phrygia have no green in them, and those of Thebes %0a%3c in Egypt are destitute of red and white veins. These last are %0a%3c good as a counterpoison to the venom of the scorpion, and the %0a%3c stones of Cyprus are held in similar repute. Some persons set %0a%3c the highest value upon those stones which present a trans- %0a%3c parency like that of glass.

To be duly efficacious, they must be attached to the %0a%3c body with hairs from a lion's mane. The hair, however, of %0a%3c the hyaena is held in abomination for this purpose, as being a %0a%3c promoter of discord in families. The stone that is of an uni- %0a%3c form colour renders athletes invincible, they say : the way of %0a%3c testing it is to throw it, along with colouring matter, into a %0a%3c pot full of oil ; after being kept for a couple of hours gently on %0a%3c the boil, if genuine, it will impart an uniform colour of vermilion %0a%3c to the mixture. %0a%3c %0a%3c Acopos 31 is a stone like nitre 33 in appearance, porous, and %0a%3c starred with drops of gold : gently boiled with oil and applied %0a%3c as an unguent, it relieves lassitude, if we choose to believe it. %0a%3c Alabastritis 33 is a stone which comes from Alabastron m %0a%3c Egypt and Damascus in Syria : it is of a white colour, spotted %0a%3c with various other tints.

Androdamas 36 has the shining colour of silver like %0a%3c adamas f it is always quadrangular, like small cubes in shape. %0a%3c The magicians are of opinion that it was thus named from the %0a%3c fact that it subdues anger and violence in man.

Antipathes 39 is a black stone, and not transparent : the mode %0a%3c of testing it, is by boiling it in milk, to which, if genuine, it %0a%3c imparts a colour like that of myrrh. A person might probably %0a%3c expect to find some extraordinary virtues in this stone, seeing %0a%3c that, among so many other substances possessed of antipathetic %0a%3c properties, it is the only one that bears this name. The ma- %0a%3c gicians will have it that it possesses the power of counter- %0a%3c acting fascinations. %0a%3c %0a%3c Arabica 40 is a stone which closely resembles ivory in ap- %0a%3c pearance, and, indeed, might easily be taken for it, were it not %0a%3c for its superior hardness : persons who have this stone about %0a%3c them, it is thought, will experience a cure of diseases of the %0a%3c sinews. Aromatitis, 41 too, is a stone that is found in Arabia, as %0a%3c also in the vicinity of Phirae in Egypt : it is always full of %0a%3c small stones, and like myrrh in colour and smell, a thing that %0a%3c makes it much in request with ladies of rank. 42 Asbestos 43 %0a%3c is found in the mountains of Arcadia, and is of an iron %0a%3c colour. Democritus informs us that aspisatis 44 is a native %0a%3c of Arabia, that it is of a fiery colour, and that patients %0a%3c should wear it attached to the body with camels' dung; he %0a%3c says, too, that it is found in the nests of certain birds 45 in %0a%3c Arabia. The same writer also mentions another stone of this %0a%3c name, that is found at Leucopetra in the same country, of a %0a%3c silver colour, radiant, and an excellent preservative against %0a%3c delirium. In India, he says, and on Mount Acidane in %0a%3c Persia, there is a stone found that is known as " atizoe," 46 of a %0a%3c silver lustre, three fingers in length, like a lentil in shape, %0a%3c possessed of a pleasant smell, and considered necessary by the %0a%3c Magi at the consecration of a king. Augetis 47 is thought by %0a%3c many to be identical with callaina. 48 Amphidanes, 49 which is %0a%3c also known as " chrysocolla," 50 is a stone found in that part of %0a%3c India where the ants 61 throw up gold, and in it there are certain %0a%3c %0a%3c 39 " Counteracting-stone." %0a%3c %0a%3c 40 Probably the stone mentioned in B. xxxvi. c. 41. %0a%3c %0a%3c 41 *' Aromatic stone."

Enorchis 16 is a white stone, the frag- %0a%3c ments of which, when it is split asunder, resemble the testes %0a%3c in shape.

Eumithres 22 is called by the Assyrians %0a%3c "gem of Belus," 23 the most sacred of all their gods; it is of a %0a%3c leek-green colour, and greatly in request for superstitious pur- %0a%3c poses.

This %0a%3c si one promotes the secretion of the milk in nursing women, it %0a%3c is said ; in addition to which, attached to the neck of infants, it %0a%3c produces saliva, and it dissolves when put into the mouth. %0a%3c They say, too, that it deprives persons of their memory : it is %0a%3c in the rivers Nilus and Acheloiis that it is produced. Some %0a%3c persons give the name of " galactitis" to a smaragdus surrounded %0a%3c with veins of white. Gallaica is a stone like argyrodamas, 36 %0a%3c but of a somewhat more soiled appearance ; these stones are %0a%3c found in twos and threes clustered together. The people of %0a%3c Media send us gassinade, 36 a stone like orobus in colour, and %0a%3c sprinkled with flowers, as it were : it is found at Arbela. %0a%3c This stone, too, conceives, 37 it is said ; a fact which it admits %0a%3c when shaken; the conception lasting for a period of three %0a%3c months. Glossopetra, 33 which resembles the human tongue, is %0a%3c not engendered, it is said, in the earth, but falls from the %0a%3c heavens during the moon's eclipse; it is considered highly ne- %0a%3c cessary for the purposes of eelenomancy. 39 To render all this %0a%3c %0a%3c ;i " Stone of the religious." . %0a%3c %0a%3c 29 " Black on the surface."

It %0a%3c has been thus named, 44 from the circumstance that, if placed %0a%3c in a vessel of water and exposed to the full light of the sun, %0a%3c it changes to a reflected colour like that of blood; this being %0a%3c the case with the stone of ^Ethiopia more particularly. Out %0a%3c of the water, too, it reflects the figure of the sun like a mirror, %0a%3c and it discovers eclipses of that luminary by showing the %0a%3c moon passing over its disk. In the use of this stone, also, we %0a%3c have a most glaring illustration of the impudent effrontery %0a%3c of the adepts in magic, for they say that, if it is combined with %0a%3c the plant 45 heliotropium, and certain incantations are then re- %0a%3c peated over it, it will render the person invisible who carries %0a%3c it about him. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hephaestitis 46 also, though a radiant stone, partakes of the %0a%3c properties of a mirror in reflecting objects. The mode of %0a%3c testing it is to put it into boiling water, which should imme- %0a%3c diately become cold. If exposed to the rays of the sun, it %0a%3c should instantly cause dry fuel to ignite : 47 Corycus 48 is the %0a%3c place where it is found.

Ham- %0a%3c monis cornu 56 is reckoned among the most sacred gems of %0a%3c ^Ethiopia ; it is of a golden colour, like a ram's horn in shape, %0a%3c and ensures prophetic dreams, it is said. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hormiscion 56 is one of the most pleasing stones to the sight; %0a%3c it is of a fiery colour, and emits rays like gold, tipped at the %0a%3c extremity with a whitish light.

Haematitis, 58 %0a%3c of the very finest quality, comes from ^Ethiopia, but it is found %0a%3c in Arabia and Africa as well. It is a stone of a blood-red %0a%3c colour, and we must not omit to mention the assurance given %0a%3c [by the magicians], that the possession of it reveals treacherous %0a%3c designs on the part of the barbarians. Zachalias of Babylon, %0a%3c in the books which he dedicated to King Mithridates, attri- %0a%3c buting the destinies of man to certain properties innate in %0a%3c precious stones, is not content with vaunting the merits of this %0a%3c stone as curative of diseases of the eyes and liver, but recom- %0a%3c mends it also as ensuring success to petitions addressed to %0a%3c kings.

Ostracias, 99 %0a%3c or ostracitis, is a testaceous stone, harder than ceramitis, 1 and %0a%3c similar in all respects to achates, 2 except that the latter has %0a%3c an unctuous appearance when polished : indeed, so remark- %0a%3c ably hard is ostracitis, that with fragments of it other gems are %0a%3c engraved. Ostritis 3 receives its name from its resemblance to %0a%3c an oyster-shell. Ophicardelon is the barbarian name for a %0a%3c 6tone of a black colour, terminated by a white line on either %0a%3c side. Of Obsian 4 stone we have already spoken in the pre- %0a%3c ceding Book.

What kind of stone paneros 7 is, Metrodorus docs %0a%3c not inform us ; but he gives some lines, by no means without %0a%3c elegance, that were written upon this stone by Queen Timaris, %0a%3c and dedicated to Venus ; from which we have reason to con- %0a%3c clude that certain fecundating virtues were attributed to it. By %0a%3c some writers it is called panerastos. 8 Of the stone called %0a%3c " pontica" 9 there are numerous varieties : one is stellated, and %0a%3c presents either blood-red spots, or drops like gold, being reck- %0a%3c oned in the number of the sacred stones. Another, in place of %0a%3c stars, has streaks of the same colour, and a fourth presents all %0a%3c the appearance of mountains and valleys. %0a%3c %0a%3c 99 " Shell-stone."

Adadunephros, adaduophthalmos, and adadudactylos, %0a%3c mean "kidney of Adad," "eye of Adad," and "finger of %0a%3c Adad," a god 38 of the Syrians so called.

COCHLIDES. %0a%3c %0a%3c New species of precious stones are repeatedly brought into %0a%3c existence, and fresh ones are found all at once, destitute of %0a%3c names. Thus, for example, there was a stone formerly dis- %0a%3c covered in the gold-mines of Lampsacus, which, on account of %0a%3c its extraordinary beauty, was sent to King Alexander, as we %0a%3c learn from Theophrastus. 76 Cochlides, 77 too, which are now so %0a%3c common, are rather artificial productions than natural, and in %0a%3c Arabia there have been found vast masses of them ; which are %0a%3c boiled, it is said, in honey, for seven days and nights without %0a%3c intermission. By doing this, all earthy and faulty particles %0a%3c are removed ; after which, the mass, thus cleansed and purified, %0a%3c is adorned by the ingenuity of artists with variegated veins and %0a%3c spots, and cut into such shapes as may be most to the taste of %0a%3c purchasers. Indeed, these articles, in former times, were made %0a%3c %0a%3c « " Honey-coloured and yellow." 69 " Saffron stone.*' %0a%3c %0a%3c 70 All three beino- derived from the corresponding name in Greek. %0a%3c %0a%3c » See Chapter 55 of this Book. 72 " Hand stone." %0a%3c %0a%3c w «« Stone of necessity." 11 * Retaining stone." » Tree stone. %0a%3c %0a%3c ™ De Lapidibus. 77 He alludes to petrified shells, most probably. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 462 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c pliny's NATURAL HISTORY.

As %0a%3c to the stones which are variegated, and to which new colours %0a%3c are imparted by the inventive ingenuity of man, as they have %0a%3c no name in common use, they are usually known by that of %0a%3c " physis;" 19 a name which claims for them, as it were, that ad- %0a%3c miration which we are more ready to bestow upon the works %0a%3c of Nature. But really, these artificial stones have names %0a%3c without end, and I could never think of recounting the infinite %0a%3c series of them, coined as they have been by the frivolous ten- %0a%3c dencies of the Greeks. %0a%3c %0a%3c Having already described the more noble gems, and indeed %0a%3c those of inferior qualit) r which are found among the stones that %0a%3c are held in high esteem, I must content myself with knowing %0a%3c that I have pointed out those kinds which are the most deserv- %0a%3c ing of mention. It will be as well, however, for the reader to %0a%3c bear in mind, that, according to the varying number of the %0a%3c spots and inequalities on their surface, according to the nume- %0a%3c rous intersections of lines and their multiplied tints and shades, %0a%3c the names of precious stones are subject to repeated changes ; %0a%3c the material itself, for the most part, remaining just the same. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 75. THE VARIOUS FORMS OF PRECIOUS STONES. %0a%3c %0a%3c We will now make some observations in reference to pre- %0a%3c cious stones in general, following therein the opinions that %0a%3c have been expressed by various authors. Stones with a level %0a%3c surface are preferred to those which are concave or protuberant %0a%3c on the face. An oblong shape is the one that is most approved %0a%3c of, and, next to that, the lenticular 80 form, as it is called. After %0a%3c this, the stone with a plane surface and circular is admired, %0a%3c those which are angular being held in the least esteem. There %0a%3c is considerable difficulty in distinguishing genuine stones from %0a%3c false ; the more so, as there has been discovered a method of %0a%3c transforming genuine stones of one kind into false stones of %0a%3c %0a%3c %3c 8 ' " Phalerae."

Nay, even %0a%3c more than this, there are books in existence, the authors of %0a%3c which I forbear to name, 83 which give instructions how to stain %0a%3c crystal in such a way as to imitate smaragdus and other trans- %0a%3c parent stones, how to make sardonyx of sarda, and other %0a%3c gems in a similar manner. Indeed, there is no kiud of fraud %0a%3c practised, by which larger profits are made. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 76. (13.) THE METHODS OF TESTING PRECIOUS STONES. %0a%3c %0a%3c On the contrary, we will make it our business to point out %0a%3c the methods of detecting these false stones, seeing that it is %0a%3c only proper to put luxury even on its guard against, fraud. %0a%3c In addition to the particulars which we have already given, %0a%3c when treating of each individual kind of precious stone, it is %0a%3c generally agreed that transparent stones should be tested by %0a%3c a morning light, or even, if necessary, so late as the fourth" 4 %0a%3c hour, but never after that hour. The modes of testing 85 stones %0a%3c are numerous : first, by their weight, the genuine stone being %0a%3c the heavier of the two ; next, by their comparative coolness, %0a%3c the genuine stone being cooler than the other to the mouth ; %0a%3c and, next to that, by their substance ; there being blisters per- %0a%3c ceptible in the body of the fictitious stone, as well as a certain %0a%3c roughness on the surface ; filaments, too, an unequal brilliancy, %0a%3c and a brightness that falls short before it reaches the eye. %0a%3c The best 86 mode of testing is to strike off a fragment with %0a%3c an iron saw ; but this is a thing not allowed by the %0a%3c dealers, who equally refuse to let their gems be tested by the %0a%3c tile. Dust of Obsian 87 stone will not leave a mark upon the %0a%3c surface of a genuine stone : but where the gem is artificial, %0a%3c %0a%3c 91 Substituting garnets for rubies, as an illustration. %0a%3c %0a%3c n "Minium."

A COMPARATIVE VIEW OF NATURE AS SHE APPEARS IN %0a%3c %0a%3c DIFFERENT COUNTRIES. THE COMPARATIVE VALUES OF THINGS. %0a%3c %0a%3c Having now treated of all the works of Nature, it will be %0a%3c as well to take a sort of comparative view of her several pro- %0a%3c ductions, as well as the countries which supply them. Through- %0a%3c out the whole earth, then, and wherever the vault of heavi n %0a%3c extends, there is no country so beautiful, or which, for the pro- %0a%3c ductions of Nature, merits so high a rank as Italy, that ruler %0a%3c and second parent of the world ; recommended as she is by %0a%3c her men, her women, her generals, her soldiers, her slaves, %0a%3c her superiority in the arts, and the illustrious examples of %0a%3c genius which she has produced. Her situation, too, is equally %0a%3c in her favour ; the salubrity and mildness of her climate ; the %0a%3c easy access which she offers to all nations ; her coasts indented %0a%3c with so many harbours; the propitious breezes, too, that always %0a%3c prevail on her shores ; advantages, all of them, due to her situa- %0a%3c tion, lying, as she does, midway between the East and the West, %0a%3c and extended in the most favourable of all positions. Add to %0a%3c this, the abundant supply of her waters, the salubrity of her %0a%3c groves, the repeated intersections of her mountain ranges, the %0a%3c comparative innocuousness of her wild animals, the fertility of %0a%3c her soil, and the singular richness of her pastures. %0a%3c %0a%3c Whatever there is that the life of man ought not to feel in %0a%3c want of, is nowhere to be found in greater perfection than %0a%3c here ; the cereals, for example, wine, oil, wool, flax, tissue?, %0a%3c and oxen.

At %0a%3c the present day, teeming as she is with these treasures, she %0a%3c contents herself with lavishing upon us, as the whole of her %0a%3c bounties, her various liquids, and the numerous flavours yielded %0a%3c by her cereals and her fruits. Next to Italy, if we except the %0a%3c fabulous regions of India, I would rank Spain, for my own %0a%3c part, those districts, at least, that lie in the vicinity of the 6ea. 9! %0a%3c She is parched and sterile in one part, it is true ; but where %0a%3c she is at all productive, she yields the cereals in abundance, %0a%3c oil, wine, horses, and metals of every kind. In all these re- %0a%3c spects, Gaul is her equal, no doubt; but Spain, on the other %0a%3c hand, outdoes the Gallic provinces in her spartum 93 and her %0a%3c 6pecular stone, 91 the products of her desert tracts, in her pig- %0a%3c ments that minister to our luxuries, in the ardour displayed by %0a%3c her people in laborious employments, in the perfect training %0a%3c of her slaves, in the robustness of body of her men, and in %0a%3c their general resoluteness of character. %0a%3c %0a%3c As to the productions themselves, the greatest value of %0a%3c all, among the products of the sea, is attached to pearls : %0a%3c of objects that lie upon the surface of the earth, it is crystals %0a%3c that are most highly esteemed : and of those derived from %0a%3c the interior, adamas, 95 smaragdus, 96 precious stones, and murr- %0a%3c hine, 97 are the things upon which the highest value is placed. %0a%3c The most costly things that are matured by the earth, are %0a%3c the kermes-berry 98 and laser that are gathered from trees, %0a%3c nard 1 and Seric tissues ; 2 that are derived from the trunks of %0a%3c trees, logs of citrus 3 -wood ; that are produced by shrubs, cin- %0a%3c %0a%3c 91 It having heen in recent times declared unlawful to work them, as %0a%3c he has already informed us. %0a%3c %0a%3c 92 "Quacunqne ambitur mari."
