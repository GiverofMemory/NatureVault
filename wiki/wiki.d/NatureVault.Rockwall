Huge human like bones and large urns and an axe with a 15 ft. long handle were discovered in a cave. These items were believed to be located outside of the wall. This suggests that the wall may have been built to keep out the giants and dangerous dinosaurs. It has been estimated that the wall is rectangular or square with 20 mi. sides. Geologists have estimated that the base of the wall would place the geological period for the construction of the wall at about 240 million years ago, assuming that the wall was built at ground level at the time.
