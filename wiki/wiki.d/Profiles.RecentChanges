At that time it was worthless so I didn't think of mining it, as it was basically a lottery if you would ever win a block.  I started getting serious about it in may 2013 but felt I was too late to buy bitcoin as it was already at $110 after a pump and heading down, I thought it was a pump and dump.  Even litecoin seemed expensive and bulky at $3 each.  I wanted to buy feathercoin since it was under a dollar, but never did.  If I did, then I would be down money even if I held this whole time!  This goes to show that you will only make money in crypto if you follow the big money players and what coins they invest in.  I started writing about bitcoin on my blog on 10-27-2017 about how bitcoin would die from the pump and dump [[https://www.naturehacker.org/2017/10/how-bitcoin-will-die-icarus.html|#]] (as you can tell I was really bothered by the unstable price).  Even before that I had been working on my own designs for a bitcoin replacement and started publishing things on my blog on 8-27-2017 [[https://www.naturehacker.org/2017/08/method-for-solving-travelling-salesman.html|#]] and 10-7-2017 I had my first design that was a true alternative to bitcoin [[https://www.naturehacker.org/2017/10/the-only-100-fully-decentralized-peer.html|#]].    Those same designs from 2017 have been contributing to my current designs in 2022 with the most recent culmination in [[CryptoProjects/Actionlattice]] which is the next generation of cryptoassets, and will obsolete blockchain. =]%0a* [[Profiles/Naturevault]]  . . .  7 Nov 2022 14:18 UTC by [[~Naturevault]]: [=Placeholder =]%0a* [[Profiles/Profiles]]  . . . 2022 Oct28 11:33 UTC by ?: [=Placeholder, all profiles that have ever edited the site should be listed here.
