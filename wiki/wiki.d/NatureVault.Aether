csum=Light can be structured via interactions and will actually travel slower in free space as well, so it actually can be slowed down permanently [[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/01/150123144158.htm|#]].  Add these up over infinite time and distance, and you have dark light which is a structured sea of dark photons.
