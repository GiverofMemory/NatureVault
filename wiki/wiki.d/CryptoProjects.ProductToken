csum=*For every $10 product you buy with fiat or tezos you get 1 product token that is redeemable for a free product.  Sort of like a buy-one-get-one.  This token is minted fresh every time you fulfill an order and if the customer provides you with a deposit address, you send them the token.  If they do not give you an address you add it as liquidity (with an equal value of tezos) at a DEX and get an LP token.  *When a customer redeems the token to you to get a free product, you give them a product.  You also mint another token but this time do not give it to the customer but rather add it directly to liquidity along with an equal value of tezos to the DEX.  You never sell your token, but rather add it back to liquidity with an equal value of tezos to farm LP tokens at the DEX.

You also state that any redeemed product tokens will never be sold or lent or used as collateral, they will be used for one of 4 purposes: add liquidity to the tezos/producttoken trading pair at a DEX, fund faucets, fund grants to other tezos/producttoken liquidity providers, or held with the intention to do one of the 3 previous purposes in the future.%0a%0a* If the token is valued less than the product on the open market you still give a full free product to the customer in exchange for the undervalued token.

By never selling, lending, or collateralizing your token you avoid making the price of your token ever go down.  You are basically acting as a token burner in terms of your effect on the price.  However you are not burning tokens but rather using them to stabilize the price on an exchange.%0a%0aIn order for the customer to arbitrage the price if your token is worth more than your product, is buy your product for $10, get a free token worth $20, sell it for $20 worth of tezos, and buy 2 more products and get 2 more tokens.  This act of arbitrage will bring the price down per token to the price of the product (but not lower because then the arbitrage won't work) but in so doing the customer is creating lots of demand for the product.
