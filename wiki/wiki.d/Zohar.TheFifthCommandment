text=The Fifth Commandment %0a%0a%0a%0a215. The fifth Mitzva. It is written: LET THE WATERS SWARM WITH %0aSWARMS OF LIVING CREATURES (Beresheet, 1:20). This verse contains %0athree Mitzvot. The first is to study the Torah, the second is to procreate and %0amultiply, and the third is to remove the foreskin on the eighth day. And it is %0anecessary to study the Torah on all the days, at all times, in order to correct %0aone's soul and spirit. %0a%0aThe four previous Mitzvot originate in the first four days of creation, and are %0aintended for the correction of the degrees H-B-ZA-M of the world of Atzilut. %0a%0aThe First Mitzva originates from the word BERESHEET (Bina, fear of the %0aGreat and Mighty Creator, who rules over all), referring only to GAR de Bina %0athat is located in AVI. The position of AVI is from Peh to Chazeh de AA, Yod of %0athe name HaVaYaH. %0a%0aThe Second Mitzva originates from the words LET THERE BE LIGHT, %0aand is meant for the correction of ZAT de Bina (called YESHSLT), located from %0aChazeh to Tahur de AA, i.e., below its Parsa. However, when it is said, LET THERE %0aBE LIGHT, this means that YESHSLT ascended and united with AVI, forming %0aone Partzuf above Chazeh de AA. And from there they ascended to Rosh de AA. %0a%0aSuch a state (degree) is called "Great love," designated by the first letter %0a(Hey) of the name HaVaYaH: Yod-Hey-Vav-Hey, and the Light passes from it to %0aZON. However, ZON cannot receive Ohr Hochma from AVI, for they are GAR de %0aBina and will always remain only with Ohr Hassadim, unwilling to receive, hence %0atheir name, "fear." %0a%0aZON, however, receive Ohr Hochma from ZAT de Bina (YESHSLT), which %0aascended above Parsa de AA, called "Great love." However, YESHSLT, which %0astand below Parsa de AA, cannot pass Ohr Hochma to ZA, for Ohr Hochma is %0aconcealed within them. Also, their Tvuna is called DRY LAND. %0a%0a405 %0a%0a%0a%0a406 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Third Mitzva originates from the two stars that were created on the %0athird day of creation, of which it is written: LET THE WATERS UNDER THE %0aHEAVENS BE GATHERED TOGETHER ONTO ONE PLACE, AND LET %0aTHE DRY LAND APPEAR... and LET THE EARTH BRING FORTH GRASS. %0aThis Mitzva is intended for the correction of VAK de ZON, whose union Above %0astems from the verse, LET THE WATERS, referring to ZA, whereas the union %0abelow stems from the verse, LET THE EARTH PUT FORTH GRASS, and %0arefers to VAK de Nukva. %0a%0aThe Fourth Mitzva originates from the verse, LET THE STARS, and is %0ameant for the correction of GAR in ZA and Malchut. Thus, all the corrections %0anecessary for AVI, YESHSUT and ZON de Atzilut have already taken place in the %0afirst four days of creation. ZON received GAR (Ohr Hochma), and, being of equal %0aheight, can now make a Zivug face to face. Therefore, the rest of the Mitzvot are %0aintended for this Zivug of ZON. %0a%0aThe Fifth Mitzva is LET THE WATERS SWARM WITH SWARMS OF %0aLIVING CREATURES. Now there is a need to bring ZON to a perfect face-to- %0aface Zivug, i.e., (i) to receive Ohr Neshama onto this Zivug, so that Adam, too, %0awill receive this Light and make a holy and pure Zivug, which is attained by %0aman's efforts in the study of the Torah; (ii) to give birth to holy souls; and (iii) %0ato correct the holy covenant by circumcision and rejection. %0a%0aMan's efforts lie in that he studies the Torah, although he realizes that he %0adoes not attain it (receives nothing in his corrected desires, called Guf, body). He %0amerely utters its words with his "mouth" (not yet able to receive the Light (Torah) %0ain his body for the Creator's sake), but as a result, he attains Ohr Nefesh. %0a%0aMan's efforts should correspond to his readiness to do everything in his %0apower to attain and understand the Torah, which causes him to attain Ohr %0aRuach. However, he must not limit himself to such attainments, but rather %0amultiply his efforts so as to attain Ohr Neshama. Thus, every day he must aspire %0ato correct his Nefesh and Ruach, and by increasing them, attain Neshama. %0a%0a216. Because man labors in the study of the Torah, he corrects the other holy %0asoul, as it is written, SWARMS OF LIVING CREATURES, referring to the %0alife-giving holy soul, Malchut. For when man does not study the Torah, he %0alacks the holy soul and the holiness that descends from Above. Yet, when he %0adoes study the Torah, he merits its Light, just like holy angels. %0a%0aNukva de ZA that makes a face-to-face Zivug with ZA in the state of Gadlut is %0acalled "living," for ZA is then called the "Tree of Life." Consequently, Nukva is %0acalled "Life." By raising MAN during the study of Torah for the Creator's sake, %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Fifth Commandment %0a%0a%0a%0a407 %0a%0a%0a%0aman causes ZON to make a Zivug and receives Ohr Ne/esh from it. And if he does %0anot study the Torah for the Creator's sake, he cannot even attain Ohr Ne/esh, for %0ahe fails to bring about the Creator's Zivug with the Shechina. And a Zivug can be %0aattained only by raising MAN. %0a%0aIt is therefore written: LET THE WATERS SWARM WITH SWARMS OF %0aLIVING CREATURES, for the Torah is called "water." If man raises MAN with %0athe help of the Torah, he merits Ohr Ne/esh (holy spirit) from Ohr Haya (Life). %0aMoreover, he merges with the Creator only after he attains Ne/esh, Ruach, and %0aNeshama from HAYA (Supernal holy life). He unites Ohr Ne/esh with Ohr Ruach, %0aOhr Ruach with Ohr Neshama, and Ohr Neshama with the Creator. %0a%0a217. It is written, "Angels of the Creator shall bless Him." This refers to those %0awho study the Torah, as they are called His angels on earth. It is also written, %0aBIRDS SOARING OVER THE EARTH. This refers to this world. However, %0ain the world to come, as it is said, the Creator will make them wings like those %0aof an eagle so they may soar in the whole world. %0a%0aWhy does The Zohar mention angels? Because angels are spiritual forces- %0amechanical enactors of the Creator's will. They were repeatedly compared to %0aanimals in our world (e.g., a horse) that fulfill man's will. Angels are spiritual %0aforces without freedom or egoism; hence, they never sin and have no need for %0athe Torah, which is why they are spiritually inanimate, motionless— they do not %0agrow spiritually. %0a%0aMan is created in such a way that before he carries out any task, he needs to %0arealize what he is supposed to do. But angels carry out their assignments even %0abefore they hear and understand what the Creator wants from them, for His %0adesire rules over them. Hence, nothing prevents them from instant fulfillment %0aof His will. They always follow the Creator, just like man's shadow follows him. %0aThis is why they are believed to act before they even hear. %0a%0aMan can therefore act like an angel (even though his desires are of egoistic %0anature) if his desires become like those of angels, whose actions precede their %0aunderstanding (hearing). Just like an angel, such a person fulfills all the Creator's %0adesires before he realizes, hears and understands them, for he follows the Creator %0aas a shadow follows man. %0a%0aThis can be illustrated by the following example: when a strong wind throws %0adust in one's eyes, he quickly shuts them, even before his brain and thoughts %0afeel and realize the need to do so: the action (shutting the eyes) precedes the %0aactual realization of the thought of dust. %0a%0a%0a%0a408 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aAlthough the physical body of such a person exists together with us in this %0aworld, his spiritual body (desires) becomes angel-like, and his actions precede %0ahis hearing. He does not need to hear in order to fulfill the Creator's will, but %0aobserves any Mitzva even before his brain realizes what he is doing. Therefore, %0ahe is regarded as an angel. %0a%0aHence, The Zohar says that in the future the Creator will provide him with %0awings to enable him to soar over the whole world. For until man attains the holy %0asoul (Ohr Ne/esh— the smallest spiritual Light), the impure force rules over him, %0aas the prophet said: "The souls of your enemies, them shall he sling out, as from %0athe hollow of a sling" (Shmuel I, 25:29). %0a%0aHence, one cannot merge with the Creator and observe His desires (Mitzvot) %0auntil he has acquired faith in the Creator's names and knows that He is absolutely %0agood to all and bestows only goodness. And if one has not yet attained the holy %0asoul, and the impure force still rules over him, when his thoughts soar above %0athe world, it seems to him as though the Creator's rule is not quite as good as it %0ashould be according to His names. This feeling of his brings corruption to the %0aCreator's holy names, and he cannot find a quiet place for himself, cannot have %0afaith in His names and draw closer to Him. %0a%0aTherefore, he stains himself with such impurity that it leads him toward %0alack of faith in the Creator and in His names. However, nothing of this affects %0athe spiritual; it occurs simply because man has not yet attained the spiritual %0arealm, and is making no effort to do so. %0a%0aBut as soon as he receives the holy soul (Ohr Ne/esh), his body (desires and %0athoughts) instantly becomes angel-like: his actions precede realization. It is written %0aabout such a person: "And the birds shall soar above the earth," for in the future, %0athe Creator will give him wings, and he will soar above the whole world. %0a%0aFor he soars mentally above the whole world and sees how the Creator %0agoverns all. Yet, not only does he not err when seeing the manifestation of this %0agovernance, he receives the strength to raise MAN to increase his spiritual anti- %0aegoistic powers. By looking upon all the forms of the Creator's rule over this %0aworld and, seeing the harshness of the external manifestations of this rule, such %0aa person is given an opportunity to ask for the strengthening of his faith. And %0aowing to his faith in the Creator's unity and absolute kindness of His rule, he %0araises MAN and receives increasingly greater Light for the Creator's sake. %0a%0a218. It is written in this regard: LET BIRDS SOAR OVER THE EARTH, %0afor the Torah, called THE WATERS, will SWARM WITH SWARMS OF %0aLIVING CREATURES from its place of life, Malchut, and all will descend %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Fifth Commandment %0a%0a%0a%0a409 %0a%0a%0a%0adown below. This is what King David referred to, when he said, THE %0aCREATOR CREATED IN ME A PURE HEART to study The Torah, and %0aA HOLY SPIRIT WAS RENEWED WITHIN ME. %0a%0aSo as to continue to explain the aforementioned text, The Zohar compares %0athe Torah to water— just as living creatures emerged from water, in the same %0away the Light of life descends from Malchut (called "life") upon the entire %0aworld. This is the Light for which King David asked the Creator. He begged %0afor a pure heart in order to study the Torah and raise MAN, for this would %0alead him to the reception of the holy spirit of renewal— the strength to merge %0awith the Creator even more. .

The sixth Mitzva is to procreate and multiply, for he who does so turns %0a> the stream, called Yesod de ZA, into an inexhaustible fountain. And the sea, %0a> Malchut, shall be filled from all directions, and new souls shall come forth %0a> from that tree, and a multitude of forces shall appear together with those %0a> souls, to guard them. Hence, it is written: LET THE WATERS SWARM %0a> WITH SWARMS OF LIVING CREATURES. This is the mark of the holy %0a> Covenant. The stream grows stronger, turns into a river, and thus brings more %0a> and more new souls to life. %0a> %0a> An awakening from below causes an awakening from Above: raising MAN, %0a> the prayers and requests of the lower ones to receive strength so they can perform %0a> spiritual, altruistic actions, stimulate a Zivug Above between the Creator and the %0a> Shechina. As a result, the stream, Yesod de ZA, fills with water and descends to %0a> Nukva de ZA, filling her on all sides, wishing to both revive all the worlds (to %0a> bestow Ohr Hassadim) and bear new souls (pass Ohr Hochma downward, for birth %0a> is possible only in Ohr Hochma). %0a> %0a> There are two kinds of Zivugim de ZON: (i) a "Zivug of existence" on Ohr %0a> Hassadim, from which Ohr Hassadim descends to provide the lower souls with %0a> what they need for their existence. This Zivug on Ohr Hassadim also gives birth %0a> to angels, (ii) A "Zivug of birth" on Ohr Hochma, which leads to the creation of %0a> new Partzufim, new human souls. %0a> %0a> These new souls emerge from the Tree (ZA). However, although they are %0a> called new, the genuinely new souls originate in the world of Ein Sof (Infinity), %0a> whereas these souls were already within Adam, and fell into the impure forces %0a> as a result of his sin. Now they are revived with the help of the Tree of Life (ZA); %0a> hence, they are called "new souls." A multitude of other forces, called Heavenly %0a> %0a> 411 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 412 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> hosts or armies, descends along with them. But completely new souls descend to %0a> the world only after the correction of Adam's sin has been completed. %0a> %0a> Yesod de ZA is called a "covenant," because we (Malchut, souls) feel and %0a> receive from it all the Light of our life. It constitutes the source of our life, %0a> descending to us from the Tree of Life (ZA). ZA ascends to AVI (called "garden") %0a> in order to take the waters from them and fill Malchut, his Nukva. A Zivug on %0a> VAK {Hassadim) is called WATERS SWARM, and a Zivug on GAR {Hochma) is %0a> called LIVING CREATURES. %0a> %0a> 220. A number of birds (angels) that soar above the whole world enter %0a> Malchut along with those souls. When a soul comes into this world, the bird %0a> that came from that tree along with that soul accompanies it. How many %0a> angels leave with each soul? Two: one on the right, and one on the left. If %0a> one so merits, they guard him, as it is written: FOR HE WILL GIVE HIS %0a> ANGELS CHARGE OVER YOU. Yet, if he does not merit, they report and %0a> accuse him. Rabbi Pinchas said: "There are three angels that guard man, %0a> if he so merits, as it is written, IF THERE BE AN ANGEL OVER HIM, %0a> A DEFENDER, ONE AMONG A THOUSAND THAT WARNS MAN. If %0a> there be an ANGEL— is the first; A DEFENDER— is the second; one among a %0a> thousand THAT WARNS man-is the third." %0a> %0a> 221. Rabbi Shimon said: "In all, there are five angels, for the verse continues: %0a> 'there is one after the giver and two more, so in all there are five.'" He replied: %0a> "This is not so. 'The giver' refers solely to the Creator Himself, and not to an %0a> angel, for only the Creator is permitted to give, but no one else." %0a> %0a> A number of angels come forth together with the begotten souls. These %0a> angels are called "soaring" or "flying." They help the souls to sentence to the %0a> scale of merit, or, conversely, complain to the Creator about these souls, and %0a> push them toward the scale of sin, which entails punishments. These angels soar %0a> above the world, see how the Creator rules over all, and report all this to the %0a> soul. If the soul so merits, it sentences itself and the entire world to the scale of %0a> merit; if not, it sentences itself and the entire world to the scale of sin. %0a> %0a> Therefore, Rabbi Pinchas does not dispute Rabbi Shimon when he says %0a> that only two angels are born with a soul. Rather, he says that as long as there %0a> are only two angels in man, he cannot sentence to the scale of merit completely, %0a> and keeps moving between the scales of sin (punishment) and merit (reward). %0a> However, through one's good deeds, the third angel is born within him, which %0a> enables man to sentence everything to the scale of merit. Hence, only with the %0a> help of the three angels can he achieve his correction.%0a\ No newline at end of file%0a

It is written: LET THE WATERS SWARM WITH %0a%3c SWARMS OF LIVING CREATURES (Beresheet, 1:20). This verse contains %0a%3c three Mitzvot. The first is to study the Torah, the second is to procreate and %0a%3c multiply, and the third is to remove the foreskin on the eighth day. And it is %0a%3c necessary to study the Torah on all the days, at all times, in order to correct %0a%3c one's soul and spirit. %0a%3c %0a%3c The four previous Mitzvot originate in the first four days of creation, and are %0a%3c intended for the correction of the degrees H-B-ZA-M of the world of Atzilut. %0a%3c %0a%3c The First Mitzva originates from the word BERESHEET (Bina, fear of the %0a%3c Great and Mighty Creator, who rules over all), referring only to GAR de Bina %0a%3c that is located in AVI. The position of AVI is from Peh to Chazeh de AA, Yod of %0a%3c the name HaVaYaH. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Second Mitzva originates from the words LET THERE BE LIGHT, %0a%3c and is meant for the correction of ZAT de Bina (called YESHSLT), located from %0a%3c Chazeh to Tahur de AA, i.e., below its Parsa. However, when it is said, LET THERE %0a%3c BE LIGHT, this means that YESHSLT ascended and united with AVI, forming %0a%3c one Partzuf above Chazeh de AA. And from there they ascended to Rosh de AA. %0a%3c %0a%3c Such a state (degree) is called "Great love," designated by the first letter %0a%3c (Hey) of the name HaVaYaH: Yod-Hey-Vav-Hey, and the Light passes from it to %0a%3c ZON. However, ZON cannot receive Ohr Hochma from AVI, for they are GAR de %0a%3c Bina and will always remain only with Ohr Hassadim, unwilling to receive, hence %0a%3c their name, "fear." %0a%3c %0a%3c ZON, however, receive Ohr Hochma from ZAT de Bina (YESHSLT), which %0a%3c ascended above Parsa de AA, called "Great love." However, YESHSLT, which %0a%3c stand below Parsa de AA, cannot pass Ohr Hochma to ZA, for Ohr Hochma is %0a%3c concealed within them. Also, their Tvuna is called DRY LAND. %0a%3c %0a%3c 405 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 406 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Third Mitzva originates from the two stars that were created on the %0a%3c third day of creation, of which it is written: LET THE WATERS UNDER THE %0a%3c HEAVENS BE GATHERED TOGETHER ONTO ONE PLACE, AND LET %0a%3c THE DRY LAND APPEAR... and LET THE EARTH BRING FORTH GRASS. %0a%3c This Mitzva is intended for the correction of VAK de ZON, whose union Above %0a%3c stems from the verse, LET THE WATERS, referring to ZA, whereas the union %0a%3c below stems from the verse, LET THE EARTH PUT FORTH GRASS, and %0a%3c refers to VAK de Nukva. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Fourth Mitzva originates from the verse, LET THE STARS, and is %0a%3c meant for the correction of GAR in ZA and Malchut. Thus, all the corrections %0a%3c necessary for AVI, YESHSUT and ZON de Atzilut have already taken place in the %0a%3c first four days of creation. ZON received GAR (Ohr Hochma), and, being of equal %0a%3c height, can now make a Zivug face to face. Therefore, the rest of the Mitzvot are %0a%3c intended for this Zivug of ZON. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Fifth Mitzva is LET THE WATERS SWARM WITH SWARMS OF %0a%3c LIVING CREATURES. Now there is a need to bring ZON to a perfect face-to- %0a%3c face Zivug, i.e., (i) to receive Ohr Neshama onto this Zivug, so that Adam, too, %0a%3c will receive this Light and make a holy and pure Zivug, which is attained by %0a%3c man's efforts in the study of the Torah; (ii) to give birth to holy souls; and (iii) %0a%3c to correct the holy covenant by circumcision and rejection. %0a%3c %0a%3c Man's efforts lie in that he studies the Torah, although he realizes that he %0a%3c does not attain it (receives nothing in his corrected desires, called Guf, body). He %0a%3c merely utters its words with his "mouth" (not yet able to receive the Light (Torah) %0a%3c in his body for the Creator's sake), but as a result, he attains Ohr Nefesh. %0a%3c %0a%3c Man's efforts should correspond to his readiness to do everything in his %0a%3c power to attain and understand the Torah, which causes him to attain Ohr %0a%3c Ruach. However, he must not limit himself to such attainments, but rather %0a%3c multiply his efforts so as to attain Ohr Neshama. Thus, every day he must aspire %0a%3c to correct his Nefesh and Ruach, and by increasing them, attain Neshama. %0a%3c %0a%3c 216. Because man labors in the study of the Torah, he corrects the other holy %0a%3c soul, as it is written, SWARMS OF LIVING CREATURES, referring to the %0a%3c life-giving holy soul, Malchut. For when man does not study the Torah, he %0a%3c lacks the holy soul and the holiness that descends from Above. Yet, when he %0a%3c does study the Torah, he merits its Light, just like holy angels. %0a%3c %0a%3c Nukva de ZA that makes a face-to-face Zivug with ZA in the state of Gadlut is %0a%3c called "living," for ZA is then called the "Tree of Life." Consequently, Nukva is %0a%3c called "Life." By raising MAN during the study of Torah for the Creator's sake, %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Fifth Commandment %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 407 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c man causes ZON to make a Zivug and receives Ohr Ne/esh from it. And if he does %0a%3c not study the Torah for the Creator's sake, he cannot even attain Ohr Ne/esh, for %0a%3c he fails to bring about the Creator's Zivug with the Shechina. And a Zivug can be %0a%3c attained only by raising MAN. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is therefore written: LET THE WATERS SWARM WITH SWARMS OF %0a%3c LIVING CREATURES, for the Torah is called "water." If man raises MAN with %0a%3c the help of the Torah, he merits Ohr Ne/esh (holy spirit) from Ohr Haya (Life). %0a%3c Moreover, he merges with the Creator only after he attains Ne/esh, Ruach, and %0a%3c Neshama from HAYA (Supernal holy life). He unites Ohr Ne/esh with Ohr Ruach, %0a%3c Ohr Ruach with Ohr Neshama, and Ohr Neshama with the Creator. %0a%3c %0a%3c 217. It is written, "Angels of the Creator shall bless Him." This refers to those %0a%3c who study the Torah, as they are called His angels on earth. It is also written, %0a%3c BIRDS SOARING OVER THE EARTH. This refers to this world. However, %0a%3c in the world to come, as it is said, the Creator will make them wings like those %0a%3c of an eagle so they may soar in the whole world. %0a%3c %0a%3c Why does The Zohar mention angels? Because angels are spiritual forces- %0a%3c mechanical enactors of the Creator's will. They were repeatedly compared to %0a%3c animals in our world (e.g., a horse) that fulfill man's will. Angels are spiritual %0a%3c forces without freedom or egoism; hence, they never sin and have no need for %0a%3c the Torah, which is why they are spiritually inanimate, motionless— they do not %0a%3c grow spiritually. %0a%3c %0a%3c Man is created in such a way that before he carries out any task, he needs to %0a%3c realize what he is supposed to do.

Hence, nothing prevents them from instant fulfillment %0a%3c of His will. They always follow the Creator, just like man's shadow follows him. %0a%3c This is why they are believed to act before they even hear. %0a%3c %0a%3c Man can therefore act like an angel (even though his desires are of egoistic %0a%3c nature) if his desires become like those of angels, whose actions precede their %0a%3c understanding (hearing). Just like an angel, such a person fulfills all the Creator's %0a%3c desires before he realizes, hears and understands them, for he follows the Creator %0a%3c as a shadow follows man. %0a%3c %0a%3c This can be illustrated by the following example: when a strong wind throws %0a%3c dust in one's eyes, he quickly shuts them, even before his brain and thoughts %0a%3c feel and realize the need to do so: the action (shutting the eyes) precedes the %0a%3c actual realization of the thought of dust. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 408 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Although the physical body of such a person exists together with us in this %0a%3c world, his spiritual body (desires) becomes angel-like, and his actions precede %0a%3c his hearing.

For until man attains the holy %0a%3c soul (Ohr Ne/esh— the smallest spiritual Light), the impure force rules over him, %0a%3c as the prophet said: "The souls of your enemies, them shall he sling out, as from %0a%3c the hollow of a sling" (Shmuel I, 25:29). %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, one cannot merge with the Creator and observe His desires (Mitzvot) %0a%3c until he has acquired faith in the Creator's names and knows that He is absolutely %0a%3c good to all and bestows only goodness. And if one has not yet attained the holy %0a%3c soul, and the impure force still rules over him, when his thoughts soar above %0a%3c the world, it seems to him as though the Creator's rule is not quite as good as it %0a%3c should be according to His names. This feeling of his brings corruption to the %0a%3c Creator's holy names, and he cannot find a quiet place for himself, cannot have %0a%3c faith in His names and draw closer to Him. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, he stains himself with such impurity that it leads him toward %0a%3c lack of faith in the Creator and in His names. However, nothing of this affects %0a%3c the spiritual; it occurs simply because man has not yet attained the spiritual %0a%3c realm, and is making no effort to do so. %0a%3c %0a%3c But as soon as he receives the holy soul (Ohr Ne/esh), his body (desires and %0a%3c thoughts) instantly becomes angel-like: his actions precede realization. It is written %0a%3c about such a person: "And the birds shall soar above the earth," for in the future, %0a%3c the Creator will give him wings, and he will soar above the whole world. %0a%3c %0a%3c For he soars mentally above the whole world and sees how the Creator %0a%3c governs all. Yet, not only does he not err when seeing the manifestation of this %0a%3c governance, he receives the strength to raise MAN to increase his spiritual anti- %0a%3c egoistic powers. By looking upon all the forms of the Creator's rule over this %0a%3c world and, seeing the harshness of the external manifestations of this rule, such %0a%3c a person is given an opportunity to ask for the strengthening of his faith. And %0a%3c owing to his faith in the Creator's unity and absolute kindness of His rule, he %0a%3c raises MAN and receives increasingly greater Light for the Creator's sake. %0a%3c %0a%3c 218. It is written in this regard: LET BIRDS SOAR OVER THE EARTH, %0a%3c for the Torah, called THE WATERS, will SWARM WITH SWARMS OF %0a%3c LIVING CREATURES from its place of life, Malchut, and all will descend %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Fifth Commandment %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 409 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c down below. This is what King David referred to, when he said, THE %0a%3c CREATOR CREATED IN ME A PURE HEART to study The Torah, and %0a%3c A HOLY SPIRIT WAS RENEWED WITHIN ME. %0a%3c %0a%3c So as to continue to explain the aforementioned text, The Zohar compares %0a%3c the Torah to water— just as living creatures emerged from water, in the same %0a%3c way the Light of life descends from Malchut (called "life") upon the entire %0a%3c world. This is the Light for which King David asked the Creator. He begged %0a%3c for a pure heart in order to study the Torah and raise MAN, for this would %0a%3c lead him to the reception of the holy spirit of renewal— the strength to merge %0a%3c with the Creator even more. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Sixth Commandment %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 219. The sixth Mitzva is to procreate and multiply, for he who does so turns %0a%3c the stream, called Yesod de ZA, into an inexhaustible fountain. And the sea, %0a%3c Malchut, shall be filled from all directions, and new souls shall come forth %0a%3c from that tree, and a multitude of forces shall appear together with those %0a%3c souls, to guard them. Hence, it is written: LET THE WATERS SWARM %0a%3c WITH SWARMS OF LIVING CREATURES. This is the mark of the holy %0a%3c Covenant. The stream grows stronger, turns into a river, and thus brings more %0a%3c and more new souls to life. %0a%3c %0a%3c An awakening from below causes an awakening from Above: raising MAN, %0a%3c the prayers and requests of the lower ones to receive strength so they can perform %0a%3c spiritual, altruistic actions, stimulate a Zivug Above between the Creator and the %0a%3c Shechina. As a result, the stream, Yesod de ZA, fills with water and descends to %0a%3c Nukva de ZA, filling her on all sides, wishing to both revive all the worlds (to %0a%3c bestow Ohr Hassadim) and bear new souls (pass Ohr Hochma downward, for birth %0a%3c is possible only in Ohr Hochma). %0a%3c %0a%3c There are two kinds of Zivugim de ZON: (i) a "Zivug of existence" on Ohr %0a%3c Hassadim, from which Ohr Hassadim descends to provide the lower souls with %0a%3c what they need for their existence. This Zivug on Ohr Hassadim also gives birth %0a%3c to angels, (ii) A "Zivug of birth" on Ohr Hochma, which leads to the creation of %0a%3c new Partzufim, new human souls. %0a%3c %0a%3c These new souls emerge from the Tree (ZA). However, although they are %0a%3c called new, the genuinely new souls originate in the world of Ein Sof (Infinity), %0a%3c whereas these souls were already within Adam, and fell into the impure forces %0a%3c as a result of his sin. Now they are revived with the help of the Tree of Life (ZA); %0a%3c hence, they are called "new souls." A multitude of other forces, called Heavenly %0a%3c %0a%3c 411 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 412 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c hosts or armies, descends along with them. But completely new souls descend to %0a%3c the world only after the correction of Adam's sin has been completed. %0a%3c %0a%3c Yesod de ZA is called a "covenant," because we (Malchut, souls) feel and %0a%3c receive from it all the Light of our life. It constitutes the source of our life, %0a%3c descending to us from the Tree of Life (ZA). ZA ascends to AVI (called "garden") %0a%3c in order to take the waters from them and fill Malchut, his Nukva. A Zivug on %0a%3c VAK {Hassadim) is called WATERS SWARM, and a Zivug on GAR {Hochma) is %0a%3c called LIVING CREATURES. %0a%3c %0a%3c 220. A number of birds (angels) that soar above the whole world enter %0a%3c Malchut along with those souls. When a soul comes into this world, the bird %0a%3c that came from that tree along with that soul accompanies it. How many %0a%3c angels leave with each soul? Two: one on the right, and one on the left. If %0a%3c one so merits, they guard him, as it is written: FOR HE WILL GIVE HIS %0a%3c ANGELS CHARGE OVER YOU. Yet, if he does not merit, they report and %0a%3c accuse him. Rabbi Pinchas said: "There are three angels that guard man, %0a%3c if he so merits, as it is written, IF THERE BE AN ANGEL OVER HIM, %0a%3c A DEFENDER, ONE AMONG A THOUSAND THAT WARNS MAN. If %0a%3c there be an ANGEL— is the first; A DEFENDER— is the second; one among a %0a%3c thousand THAT WARNS man-is the third." %0a%3c %0a%3c 221. Rabbi Shimon said: "In all, there are five angels, for the verse continues: %0a%3c 'there is one after the giver and two more, so in all there are five.'" He replied: %0a%3c "This is not so. 'The giver' refers solely to the Creator Himself, and not to an %0a%3c angel, for only the Creator is permitted to give, but no one else." %0a%3c %0a%3c A number of angels come forth together with the begotten souls. These %0a%3c angels are called "soaring" or "flying." They help the souls to sentence to the %0a%3c scale of merit, or, conversely, complain to the Creator about these souls, and %0a%3c push them toward the scale of sin, which entails punishments. These angels soar %0a%3c above the world, see how the Creator rules over all, and report all this to the %0a%3c soul. If the soul so merits, it sentences itself and the entire world to the scale of %0a%3c merit; if not, it sentences itself and the entire world to the scale of sin. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, Rabbi Pinchas does not dispute Rabbi Shimon when he says %0a%3c that only two angels are born with a soul. Rather, he says that as long as there %0a%3c are only two angels in man, he cannot sentence to the scale of merit completely, %0a%3c and keeps moving between the scales of sin (punishment) and merit (reward). %0a%3c However, through one's good deeds, the third angel is born within him, which %0a%3c enables man to sentence everything to the scale of merit. Hence, only with the %0a%3c help of the three angels can he achieve his correction. %0a\ No newline at end of file%0a
