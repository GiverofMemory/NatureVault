(1.)-WHEN THE WILD PLANTS WERE FIRST BROUGHT %0a%0aINTO USE. %0a%0aThe more highly esteemed plants of which I am now about %0ato speak, and which are produced by the earth for medicinal %0apurposes solely, inspire me with admiration of the industry %0aand laborious research displayed by the ancients. Indeed there %0ais nothing that they have not tested by experiment or left %0auntried; no discovery of theirs which they have not disclosed, %0aor which they have not been desirous to leave for the benefit %0aof posterity. We, on the contrary, at the present day, make %0ait our object to conceal and suppress the results of our labours, %0aand to defraud our fellow-men of blessings even which have %0abeen purchased by others. For true it is, beyond all doubt, %0athat those who have gained any trifling accession of knowledge, %0akeep it to themselves, and envy the enjoyment of it by others; to %0aleave mankind uninstructed being looked upon as the high prero¬ %0agative of learning. So far is it from being the habit with them %0ato enter upon new fields of discovery, with the view of bene- %0afitting mankind at large, that for this long time past it has been %0athe greatest effort of the ingenuity of each, to keep to himself %0athe successful results of the experience of former ages, and so %0abury them for ever! %0a%0aAnd yet, by Hercules! a single invention before now has %0aelevated men to the rank of gods; and how many an individual %0ahas had his name immortalized in being bestowed upon some %0aplant which he was the first to discover, thanks to the %0agratitude which prompted a succeeding age to make some %0aadequate return! If it had been expended solely upon the %0aplants which are grown to please the eye, or which invite %0aus by their nutrimental properties, this laborious research on %0athe part of the ancients would not have been so surprising; %0ahut in addition to this, we find them climbing by devious %0atracts to the very summit of mountains, penetrating to the very %0a%0a%0a78 %0a%0a%0apliny’s natural history. %0a%0a%0a[Book XXY. %0a%0a%0aheart of wilds and deserts, and searching into every vein and %0afibre of the earth—and all this, to discover the hidden virtues %0aof every root, the properties of the leaf ot every plant, and the %0avarious purposes to which they might be applied; converting %0athereby those vegetable productions, which the very beasts of %0athe field refuse to touch, into so many instruments for our %0awelfare. %0a%0aCHAP. 2. (2.) -THE LATIN AUTHORS WHO HAVE WRITTEN UPON %0a%0aTHESE PLANTS. %0a%0aThis subject has not been treated of by the writers in our %0aown language so extensively as it deserves, eager as they have %0aproved themselves to make enquiry into everything that is %0aeither meritorious or profitable. M. Cato, that great master %0ain all useful knowledge, was the first, and, for a long time, the %0aonly author who treated of this branch 1 of learning; and %0abriefly as he has touched upon it, he has not omitted to make %0asome mention of the remedial treatment of cattle. After him, %0aanother illustrious personage, C. Valgius, 2 a man distinguished %0afor his erudition, commenced a treatise upon the same subject, %0awhich he dedicated to the late Emperor Augustus, but left %0aunfinished. At the beginning of his preface, replete as it is %0awith a spirit of piety, 3 he expresses a hope that the majestic %0asway of that prince may ever prove a most efficient remedy %0afor all the evils to which mankind are exposed. %0a%0aCHAP. 3.-AT WHAT PERIOD THE ROMANS ACQUIRED SOME KNOW¬ %0a%0aLEDGE OF THIS SUBJECT. %0a%0aThe only 4 person among us, at least so far as I have been able %0ato ascertain, who had treated of this subject before the time of %0aValgius, was Pompeius Lenseus, 5 the freedman of Fompeius %0aMagnus; and it was in his day, I find, that this branch of %0aknowledge first began to be cultivated among us. Mithridates, %0athe most powerful monarch of that period, and who was finally %0aconquered by Pompeius, is generally thought to have been a %0a%0a1 As Fee remarks, it is more as a writer upon Agriculture than upon %0aMateria Mcdica, that Cato is entitled to the thanks of posterity. %0a%0a2 See end of B. xx. - %0a%0a3 His piety, apparently, was tainted with adulation. %0a%0a4 With the exception of Cato, of course. %0a%0a5 See end of B. xiv. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 3.] the Homans’ fihst knowledge of wild plants. 79 %0a%0amore zealous promoter of discoveries for the benefit of mankind, %0athan any of his predecessors—a fact evinced not only by many %0apositive proofs, but by universal report as well. It was be %0awho first thought, the proper precautions being duly taken, of %0adrinking poison every day ; it being his object, by becoming / %0ahabituated to it, to neutralize its dangerous effects. This * %0aprince was the first discoverer too of the various kinds of anti¬ %0adotes, one® of which, indeed, still retains his name; and it is %0agenerally supposed that he was the first to employ the blood %0aof the ducks of Pontus as an ingredient in antidotes, from the %0acircumstance that they derive their nutriment from poisons. 6 7 %0a%0aIt was to Mithridates that Asclepiades, 8 that celebrated %0aphysician, dedicated his works, still extant, and sent them, as a %0asubstitute for his own personal attendance, when requested by %0athat monarch to leave Itome and reside at his court. It is a %0awell-known fact, that this prince was the only person that was %0aever able to converse in so many as two-and-twenty languages, %0aand that, during the whole fifty-six years of his reign, he never %0arequired the services of an interpreter when conversing with %0aany individuals of the numerous nations that were subject to %0ahis sway. %0a%0aAmong the other gifts of extraordinary genius with which %0ahe was endowed, Mithridates displayed a peculiar fondness for %0aenquiries into the medical art; and gathering items of informa¬ %0ation from all his subjects, extended, as they were, over a large %0aproportion of the world, it was his habit to make copies %0aof their communications, and to take notes of the results which %0aupon experiment had been produced. These memoranda, which %0ahe kept in his private cabinet, 9 fell into the hands of Pompeius, %0awhen he took possession of the royal treasures; who at once %0acommissioned his freedman, Lenteus the grammarian, to trans¬ %0alate them into the Latin language : the result of which was, %0athat his victory was equally conducive to the benefit of the %0arepublic and of mankind at large. %0a%0a6 See c. 79 of this Book: also B. xxiii. c. 77, and B. xxix. c. 8. %0a%0a7 A mere prejudice, arising from the fact that numerous poisonous plants %0agrew in the countries on the shores of the Euxine.

Among them, Crateuas, %0aDionysius, and Metrodorus, adopted a very attractive method %0aof description, though one which has done little more than %0aprove the remarkable difficulties which attended it. It was %0atheir plan to delineate the various plants in colours, and then %0ato add in writing a description of the properties which they %0apossessed. Pictures, however, are very apt to mislead, and %0amore particularly where such a number of tints is required, %0afor the imitation of nature with any success; in addition to %0awhich, the diversity of copyists from the original paintings, %0aand their comparative degrees of skill, add very considerably %0ato the chances of losing the necessary degree of resemblance %0ato the originals. And then, besides, it is not sufficient to de- %0alineate a plant as it appears at one period only, as it presents %0aa different appearance at each of the four seasons of the year. 11 ’ %0a%0aCHAP. 5.—THE FIRST GREEK AUTHORS WHO WROTE UPON PLANTS. %0a%0aHence it is that other writers have confined themselves to %0aa verbal description of the plants; indeed some of them have %0anot so much as described them even, but have contented them¬ %0aselves for the most part with a bare recital of their names, %0aconsidering it sufficient if they pointed out their virtues and %0aproperties to such as might feel inclined to make further en¬ %0aquiries into the subject. Nor is this a kind of knowledge %0aby any means difficult to obtain; at all events, so far as re¬ %0agards myself, with the exception of a very few, it has been %0amy good fortune to examine them all, aided by the scientific %0aresearches of Antonius Castor, 11 who in our time enjoyed the %0ahighest reputation for an intimate acquaintance with this %0abranch of knowledge. I had the opportunity of visiting his %0agarden, in which, though he had passed his hundredth year, he %0acultivated vast numbers of plants with the greatest care. %0aThough he had reached this great age, he had never experienced %0a%0a10 The four great changes in plants, though not always at the four %0aseasons of the year, are the budding and foliation, the blossoming, the %0afructification, and the fall of the leaf. u See end of B. xx. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 5.] GREEK AUTHORS WHO HAVE WRITTEN ON PLANTS. 81 %0a%0aany bodily ailment, and neither his memory nor his natural %0avigour had been the least impaired by the lapse of time. %0a%0aThere was nothing more highly admired than an intimate %0aknowledge of plants, in ancient times. It is long since the %0ameans were discovered of calculating before-hand, not only %0athe day or the night, but the very hour even at which an %0aeclipse of the sun or moon is to take place ; and yet the greater %0apart of the lower classes still remain firmly persuaded that %0athese phenomena are brought about by compulsion, through the %0aagency of herbs and enchantments, and that the knowledge of %0athis art is confined almost exclusively to females. What %0acountry, in fact, is not filled with the fabulous stories about %0aMedea of Colchis and other sorceresses, the Italian Circe in %0aparticular, who has been elevated to the rank of a divinity %0aeven ? It is with reference to her, I am of opinion, that %0aJEschylus, 12 one of the most ancient of the poets, asserts that %0aItaly is covered with plants endowed with potent effects, and %0athat many writers say the same of Circeii, 13 the place of her %0aabode. Another great proof too that such is the case, is the %0afact, that the nation of the Marsi, 14 descendants of a son of %0aCirce, are well known still to possess the art of taming ser¬ %0apents. %0a%0aHomer, that great parent of the learning and traditions of %0aantiquit}’, while extolling the fame of Circe in many other %0arespects, assigns to Egypt the glory of having first discovered %0athe properties of plants, and that too at a time when the %0aportion of that country which is now watered by the river %0alulus was not in existence, having been formed at a more recent %0aperiod by the alluvion 15 of that river. At all events, he states 18 %0athat numerous Egyptian plants were sent to the Helena of his %0astory, by the wife of the king of that country, together with %0athe celebrated nepenthes, 17 which ensured oblivion of all %0asorrows and forgetfulness of the past, a potion which Helena %0awas to administer to all mortals. The first person, however, %0aof whom the remembrance has come down to us, as having %0a%0a12 There is little doubt that he alludes to the passage of JEschylus, %0aquoted by Theophrastus, Hist.

Homer also speaks of several other plants by name, of %0awhich we shall have occasion to make further mention in their %0aappropriate places. %0a%0aIn later times again, Pythagoras, that celebrated philosopher, %0awas the first to write a treatise on the properties of plants, a %0awork in which he attributes the origin and discovery of them %0ato Apollo, iEsculapius, and the immortal gods in general. %0aDemocritus too, composed a similar work. Both of these philo¬ %0asophers had visited the magicians of Persia, Arabia, ^Ethiopia, %0aand Egypt, and so astounded were the ancients at their recitals, %0aas to learn to make assertions which transcend all belief. %0aXanthus, the author of some historical works, tells us, in the %0afirst of them, that a young dragon 19 was restored to life by its %0aparent through the agency of a plant to which he gives the %0aname of “ ballis,” and that one Tylon, who had been killed by %0aa dragon, was restored to life and health by similar means. %0aJuba too assures us that in Arabia a man was resuscitated by %0athe agency of a certain plant. Democritus has asserted—and %0aTheophrastus believes it—that there is a certain herb in %0aexistence, which, upon being carried thither by a bird, the name %0aof which we have already 20 given, has the effect, by the contact %0asolely, of instantaneously drawing a wedge from a tree, when %0adriven home by the shepherds into the wood. %0a%0aThese marvels, incredible as they are, excite our admiration %0anevertheless, and extort from us the admission that, making %0aall due allowance, there is much in them that is based on %0atruth. Hence it is too that I find it the opinion of most %0awriters, that there is nothing which cannot be effected by the %0aagency of plants, but that the properties of by far the greater %0apart of them remain as yet unknown. In the number of %0athese was Herophilus, a celebrated physician, a saying of whose %0ais reported, to the effect that some plants may possibly exercise %0aa beneficial influence, if only trodden under foot. Be this as %0ait may, it has been remarked more than once, that wounds and %0a%0a18 See B. xxi. cc. 21, 84. 19 Or serpent. %0a%0a20 In B. x. c. 20. %0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 6.] %0a%0a%0aMEDICINAL PLANTS. %0a%0a%0a83 %0a%0a%0amaladies are sometimes inflamed 51 upon the sudden approach of %0apersons who have been journeying on foot. %0a%0aCHAP. 6.-WHY A FEW OF THE PLANTS ONLY HAVE BEEN USED %0a%0aMEDICINALLY. PLANTS, THE MEDICINAL PKOPEBTIES OF WHICH %0a%0aHAVE BEEN MIBACULOUSLY DISCOVERED. THE CYNORRHODOS : %0a%0aTWO REMEDIES. THE PLANT CALLED DRACUNCULUS : ONE %0a%0aREMEDY. THE BRITANNICA I FIVE REMEDIES. %0a%0aSuch was the state of medical knowledge in ancient times, %0awholly concealed as it was in the language of the Greeks. But %0athe main reason why the medicinal properties of most plants %0aremain still unknown, is the fact that they have been tested %0a6olely by rustics and illiterate people, such being the only class %0aof persons that live in the midst of them: in addition to %0awhich, so vast is the multitude of medical men always at hand, %0athat the public are careless of making any enquiries about %0athem. Indeed, many of those plants, the medicinal properties %0aof which have been discovered, are still destitute of names— %0a6uch, for instance, as the one which we mentioned 22 when speak¬ %0aing of the cultivation of grain, and which we know for certain %0awill have the effect of keeping birds away from the crops, if %0aburied at the four corners of the field. %0a%0aBut the most disgraceful cause of all, why so few simples %0aare known, is the fact that those even who are acquainted %0awith them are unwilling to impart their knowledge ; as though, %0aforsooth, they should lose for ever anything that they might %0athink fit to communicate to others ! Added to all this, there is %0ano well-ascertained method to guide us to the acquisition of this %0akind of knowledge; for, as to the discoveries that have been %0amade already, they have been due, some of them, to mere %0aaccident, and others again, to say the truth, to the interposition %0aof the Deity. %0a%0aDown to our own times, the bite of the mad dog, the symp¬ %0atoms of which are a dread of water and an aversion to every %0akiud of beverage, was incurable ;- 3 and it was only recently that %0a%0a21 Most probably by the agency of “ feverish expectation ” on the %0apart of the patient. 22 In B. xviii. c. 45. %0a%0a23 As Fee remarks, this dreadful malady is still incurable, notwithstand¬ %0aing the eulogiums which have been lavished upon the virtues of the Scu¬ %0atellaria laterifolia of Linnaeus, the Alisma plantago, Genista tinctoria, and %0aother plants, as specifics for its cure. %0a%0aa 2 %0a%0a%0a84 %0a%0a%0apliny’s natural history. %0a%0a%0a[Book XXV, %0a%0a%0athe mother of a soldier who was serving in the pnetorian guard, %0aTeceived a warning in a dream, to send her son the root of %0athe wild rose, known as the cynorrhodos, 24 a plant the beauty %0aof which had attracted her attention in a shrubbery the %0aday before, and to request him to drink the extract of it. The %0aarmy was then serving in Lacetania, the part of Spain which %0alies nearest to Italy; and it so happened that the soldier, %0ahaving been bitten by a dog, was just beginning to manifest a %0ahorror of water when his mother’s letter reached him, in %0awhich she entreated him to obey the words of this divine %0awarning. He accordingly complied with her request, and, %0aagainst all hope or expectation, his life was saved; a result 13 %0awhich has been experienced by all who have since availed them¬ %0aselves of the same resource. Before this, the cynorrhodos had %0abeen only recommended by writers for one medicinal purpose; %0athe spongy excrescences, they say, which grow 26 in the midst of %0aits thorns, reduced to ashes and mixed with honey, will make the %0ahair grow again when it has been lost by alopecy. I know too, %0afor a fact, that in the same province there was lately discovered %0ain the land belonging to a person with whom I was staying, a %0astalked plant, the name given to which was dracunculus. 27 This %0aplant, about an inch in thickness, and spotted with various %0acolours, like a viper’s skin, was generally reported to be an %0aeffectual preservative against the sting of all kinds of serpents. %0aI should remark, however, that it is a different plant from the %0aone of the same name of which mention has been made in the %0apreceding Book, 26 having altogether another shape and appear¬ %0aance. There is also another marvellous property belonging to %0ait: in spring, when the serpents begin to cast their slough, it %0ashoots up from the ground to the height of about a couple of %0afeet, and again, when they retire for the winter it conceals %0aitself within the earth, nor is there a serpent to be seen so long %0aas it remains out of sight. Even if this plant did nothing %0aelse but warn us of impending danger, and tell us when to %0abe on our guard, it could not be looked upon otherwise than %0aas a beneficent provision made by Nature in our behalves. %0a%0a21 Dog-rose, or eglantine. See B. via. c. 63. %0a%0a13 An unwarranted assertion, no doubt. %0a%0a26 He alludes to a substance known to us as “ bede%3cmar ” a kind of %0agall-nut, produced by the insect called Cynips rosse. ° %0a%0a27 Or “ little dragon.” The Arum dracunculus of Linuseus.

It is not, however, the animals only that are endowed %0awith certain baneful and noxious properties, but, sometimes, %0awaters 29 even, and localities as well. Upon one occasion, in his %0aGerman campaign, Germanicus Caesar had pitched his camp %0abeyond the river Ithenus; the only fresh water to be obtained %0abeing that of a single spring in the vicinity of the sea-shore. %0aIt was found, however, that within two years the habitual use %0aof this water was productive of loss of the teeth and a total %0arelaxation of the joints of the knees: the names given to %0athese maladies, by medical men, were “ stomacace” 30 and %0a“ sceloturbe.” A remedy for them was discovered, however, %0ain the plant known as the “ britannica,” 31 which is good, not %0aonly for diseases of the sinews and mouth, but for quinzy 32 also, %0aand injuries inflicted by serpents. This plant has dark oblong %0aleaves and a swarthy root: the name given to the flower of it %0ais “ vibones,” 33 and if it is gathered and eaten before thunder %0ahas been heard, it will ensure safety in every respect. The %0aIrish, a nation then on terms of friendship with us, and within %0awhose territories the Homan army was encamped, pointed out %0athis plant to our soldiers: the name 31 given to it, however, %0a%0a29 As P’ee remarks, the influence of water impregnated with selenite %0aupon*the health is well known. %0a%0a30 Fee says that this disease was an “ intense gastritis, productive of a %0afetid breath.” It would seem, however, to be neither more nor less than %0athe malady now known as “ scurvy of the gums.” Galen describes the %0a“sceloturbe,” as a kind of paralysis. “Stomacace” means “ disease of %0athe mouth ;” “ sceloturbe ” “ disease of the legs.” %0a%0a31 Sprengel and Desfontaines identify it with the Itumex aquaticus, but %0aFee considers it to be the Inula Britannica of Linnmus. The Statice %0aarmeria, Statice plantaginea, and Polygonum persicaria have also been %0asuggested. %0a%0a32 The pseudo-Apuleius, in B. xxix. t. 7, says, that if gathered before %0athunder has been heard, it will be a preservative against quinzy for a whole %0ayear. %0a%0a33 The flower of the Inula Britannica, Fee says, is much more likely, %0afrom its peculiarities, to have merited a peculiar name, than that of the %0aliuraex. %0a%0a34 Lipsius, in his Commentaries upon Tacitus, Ann. i. 63, has very %0asatisfactorily shown that it did not derive its name from the islands of %0aBritain, but from a local appellation, the name given by the natives to the %0amarshy tracts upon the banks of the Ems, between Lingen and Covoerden, %0awhich are still known as the “ Bretaasche Heyde.” Hunting and Poin- %0a6 inet de Sivry suggest that it may have received its name from being used %0aas a strengthener of the teeth in their sockets, being compounded of the %0awords tann, “ tooth,” and brita, “ to break.” %0a%0a%0a86 %0a%0a%0aflint’s natural history. %0a%0a%0a[Book XIV. %0a%0a%0arather surprises me, though possibly it may have been so %0acalled because the shores of Britannia are in the vicinity, und %0aonly separated by the ocean. At all events, it was not called %0aby this name from the fact of its growing there in any great %0aabundance, that is quite certain, for at the time I am speaking %0aof, Britannia was still independent . 35 %0a%0aCHAP. 7 .- WHAT DISEASES ARE ATTENDED WITH TnE GREATEST PAIN, %0a%0aNAMES OF PERSONS WHO HAVE DISCOVERED FAMOUS PLANTS. %0a%0aIn former times there was a sort of ambition, as it were, of %0aadopting plants, by bestowing upon them one’s name, a thing %0athat has been done before now by kings even, as we shall have %0aoccasion to show : 36 so desirable a thing did it appear to have %0amade the discovery of some plant, and thus far to have contri¬ %0abuted to the benefit of mankind. At the present day, however, %0ait is far from impossible that there may be some who will %0alook upon these researches of ours as frivolous even, so distaste¬ %0aful to a life of ease and luxury are the very things which bo %0agreatly conduce to our welfare. %0a%0aStill, however, it will be only right to mention in the first %0aplace those plants the discoverers of which are known, their %0avarious properties being classified 37 according to the several %0amaladies for the treatment of which they are respectively em¬ %0aployed : in taking a review of which one cannot do otherwise %0athan bewail the unhappy lot of mankind, subject as it is, in %0aaddition to chances and changes, and those new afflictions which %0aevery hour is bringing with it, to thousands of diseases which %0amenace the existence of each mortal being. It would seem %0aalmost an act of folly to attempt to determine which of these %0adiseases is attended with the most excruciating pain, seeing %0athat every one is of opinion that the malady with which for %0athe moment he himself is afflicted, is the most excruciating %0aand insupportable. The general experience, however, of the %0apresent age has come to the conclusion, that the most agonizing %0atorments are those attendant upon strangury, resulting from %0acalculi in the bladder ; next to them, those arising from ma¬ %0aladies of the stomach ; and in the third place, those caused by %0apains and affections of the head; for it is more generally in %0a%0a35 And therefore comparatively unknown. %0a%0a36 In c. 33, et seq., of this Book. %0a%0a%0a37 In the next Book. %0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 8.] %0a%0a%0aMOLY. %0a%0a%0a87 %0a%0a%0athese cases, we find, and not in others, that patients are %0atempted to commit suicide. %0a%0aFor my own part, I am surprised that the Greek authors %0ahave gone so far as to give a description of noxious plants %0aeven; in using which term, I wish it to be understood that %0aI do not mean the poisonous plants merely; for such is our %0atenure of life that death is often a port of refuge to even the %0abest of men. We meet too, with one case of a somewhat %0asimilar nature, where M. Vurro speaks of Servius Clodius , 38 a %0amember of the Equestrian order, being so dreadfully tormented %0awith gout, that he had his legs rubbed all over with poisons, %0athe result of which was, that from that time forward all sensa¬ %0ation, equally with all pain, was deadened in those parts of his %0abody. Hut what excuse, I say, can there be for making the %0aworld acquainted with plants, the only result of the use of %0awhich is to derange the intellect, to produce abortion, and to %0acause numerous other effects equally pernicious ? So far as I am %0aconcerned, I shall describe neither abortives nor philtres, %0abearing in mind, as I do, that Lucullus, that most celebrated %0ageneral, died of the effects of a philtre . 39 Nor shall I speak %0aof other ill-omened devices of magic, unless it be to give %0awarning against them, or to expose them, for I most emphati¬ %0acally condemn all faith and belief in them.

The discovery of it ho attributes to Mercury, who was %0aalso the first to point out* its uses as neutralizing the most %0apotent spells of sorcery. At the present day, it is said, it %0agrows in the vicinity of Lake Pheneus, and in Cyllene, a dis¬ %0atrict of Arcadia. It answers the description given of it by %0aHomer, having a round black root, about as large as an onion, %0aand a leaf like that of the squill: there is no 4 * difficulty ex- %0aperienced in taking it up. The Greek writers have deline¬ %0aated 43 it as having a yellow flower, while Homer , 41 on the %0aother hand, has spoken of it as white. I once met with a %0aphysician, a person extremely well acquainted with plants, %0awho assured me that it is found growing in Italy as well, and %0athat he would send me in a few days a specimen which had %0abeen dug up in Campania, with the greatest difficulty, from a %0arocky soil. The root of it was thirty 45 feet in length, and even %0athen it was not entire, having been broken in the getting up. %0a%0aCHAP. 9. —THE DODECATHEOS : ONE REMEDY. %0a%0aThe plant next in esteem to moly, is that called dodeca- %0atheos , 46 it being looked upon as under the especial tute¬ %0alage of all the superior gods . 41 . Taken in water, it is a cure, %0athey say, for maladies of every kind. The leaves of it, seven %0ain number, and very similar to those of the lettuce, spring %0afrom a yellow root. %0a%0aCHAP. 10 . -THE PA20NIA, PENTORORHS, OR GLTCY8IDK : ONE %0a%0aREMEDY. %0a%0aThe plant known as “paeonia ” 48 is the most ancient of them %0aall. It still retains the name 49 of him who was the first to %0a%0aderives the name “ Moly ” from the Arabic, and identities it with the %0aAllium nigrum of Linnaeus. %0a%0a42 Homer says that there is difficulty to men, but not to the gods. %0a%0a43 In their pictures, mentioned in c. 4. %0a%0a44 Ovid, Galen, and Theophrastus, say the same. %0a%0a45 There must either he some error in the reading here, or the physician %0amust have attempted to impose upon our author’s credulity. %0a%0a46 Or “ the twelve gods.” %0a%0a47 Generally identified with the Primula vulgaris or officinalis of Lin¬ %0anaeus. Its leaves, however, are of varying number, and not like those of %0athe lettuce.

It grows in umbrageous mountain localities, and puts %0aforth a stem amid the leaves, some four fingers in height, at the %0asummit of which are four or five heads resembling Greek %0anuts 5 - in appearance ; enclosed in which, there is a considerable %0aquantity of seed of a red or black colour. This plant is a %0apreservative against the illusions 53 practised by the Fauni in %0asleep. It is generally recommended to take it up at night; %0afor if the wood-pecker 61 of Mars should perceive a person doing %0aso, it will immediately attack his eyes in defence of the plant. %0a%0aCHAP. 11 . -THE PANACES ASCLEIUON : TWO KEMEDIES. %0a%0aThe panaces, by its very name , 55 gives assurance of a remedy for %0aall diseases: there are numerous kinds of it, and the discovery %0aof its properties has been attributed to the gods. One of these %0akinds is known by the additional name of “ asclepion ,” 56 in %0acommemoration of the circumstance that JEsculapius gave the %0aname of Panacia 57 to his daughter. The juice of it, as we have %0ahad occasion to remark already , 53 coagulates like that of %0afennel-giaut; the root is covered with a thick rind of a salt %0aflavour. %0a%0aAfter this plant has been taken up, it is a point religiously %0aobserved to fill the hole with various kinds of grain, a sort of %0aexpiation, as it were, to the earth. We have already 59 stated, %0awhen speaking of the exotic productions, where and in what %0amanner this juice is prepared, and what kind is the most %0aesteemed. That which is imported from Macedonia is known %0aas “ bucolicon,” from the fact that the neatherds there are %0ain the habit of collecting it as it spontaneously exudes: it %0aevaporates, however, -with the greatest rapidity.

The leaf is similar to that of %0alapathum, except that it is larger and more hairy ; the flower %0ais of a golden colour, and the root diminutive. It grows in rich, %0aunctuous soils. The flower of this plant is extremely effi¬ %0acacious ; hence it is that it is more generally used than the %0akinds previously mentioned. %0a%0aCHAP. 14 . -THE PANACES CENTAURION OR PHARNACI0N : %0a%0aTHREE REMEDIES. %0a%0aA fourth kind of panaces, discovered also by Chiron, is %0aknown by the additional name of “ centaurion :” 63 it is also %0acalled “ pharnacion,” from King Pharnaces, it being a matter %0ain dispute whether it Avas really discovered by Chiron or by %0athat prince. It is grown from seed , 04 and the leaves of it are %0alonger than those of the other kinds, and serrated at the edge. %0aThe root, which is odoriferous, is dried in the shade, and is %0aused for imparting an aroma to Avine. Some writers distin- %0a%0a60 Identified with the Laserpitium Chironiam of Linnaeus, otherwise %0acalled Pastinaca opopanax. Fee observes, that when the word ‘ Panaces’ %0ais used alone, this plant is always the one meant. %0a%0a61 In B. xx. cc. 62, 69. %0a%0a03 The Centaur Chiron; see B. vii. c. 57. Sprengel identifies this plant %0awith the Hypericum origanifolium of Willdenow, but Fee is inclined to %0athink that its synonym is still unknown. M.

The stem is thin, about four fingers in length, the %0aflower red, and the leaves like those of coriander. It is found %0agrowing in the vicinity of lakes and rivers, and is extremely %0aefficacious for the cure of all wounds made by iron. 66 %0a%0aCHAP. 16 . -THE AMrELOS CHIRONIA : ONE REMEDY. %0a%0aThe ainpelos Chironia 67 also, which we have already 68 men¬ %0ationed when speaking of the vines, is a discovery due to %0aChiron. We have spoken too, on a previous occasion, 69 of a %0aplant, the discovery of which is attributed to Minerva. %0a%0aCHAP. 17.-HYOSCYAMOS, KNOWN ALSO AS TnE APOLLINARIS OR %0a%0aALTEBCCM ; FIVE VARIETIES OF IT : THREE REMEDIES. %0a%0aTo Hercules also is attributed the discovery of the plant %0aknown as the “ apollinaris,” and, among the Arabians, as the %0a“altercum” or “ altercangenum by the Greeks it is called %0a“ hyoscyamos.” 70 There are several varieties of it; one of %0athem, 71 with a black seed, flowers bordering on purple, and a %0aprickly stem, growing in Galatia. The common kind 72 again, %0ais whiter, more shrublike, and taller than the poppy. The %0a6eed of a third variety is similar to that of irio 73 in appearance; %0abut they have, all of them, the effect of producing vertigo and %0ainsanity. A fourth 74 kind again is soft, lanuginous, and more %0aunctuous than the others ; the seed of it is white, and it grows %0ain maritime localities. It is this kind that medical men %0a%0a65 Hardouin identifies it with the Geranium Robertianum of Linnaeus; %0aSprengel and Desfontaines with the Phellandrium mutellina of Linnaeus; %0aColumna with the Sanicula; Sibthorpe with the Scrofularia lucida; and %0aM. Fraiis with the Scrofula chrysanthemifolia of Linnaeus. Fee expresses %0ahimself unable to speak with any certainty on the subject. %0a%0a66 Whence its name “ sidereon.” 67 Or “ Chironian vine.” %0a%0a68 In B. xxiii. c. 17. 69 In B. xxii. c. 20. %0a%0a70 “ Swine’s bean ”—our henbane. %0a%0a71 The Hyoscyamus reticulatus of Linnaeus, reticulated henbane. %0a%0a72 The Hyoscyamus niger of Linnaeus, black henbane. %0a%0a73 See B. xviii. c. 22, and B. xxii. c. 75.

Hyoscyamos, like wine, has the property of %0aflying to the head, and consequently of acting injuriously upon %0athe mental faculties. %0a%0aThe seed is either used in its natural state, or else the juice %0aof it is extracted: the juice also of the stem and leaves is %0asometimes extracted, separately from the seed. The root is %0asometimes made use of; but the employment of this plant in %0aany way for medical purposes is, in my opinion, highly dan- %0agerous. For it is a fact well ascertained, that the leaves even %0awill exercise a deleterious effect upon the mind, if more than %0afour are taken at a time; though the ancients were of opinion %0athat the leaves act as a febrifuge, taken in wine. From the %0aseed, as already 76 stated, an oil is extracted, which, injected %0ainto the ears, deranges the intellect. It is a singular thing, %0abut we find remedies mentioned for those who have taken %0athis juice, as though for a poison, while at the same time we %0afind it prescribed as a potion among the various remedies. %0aIn this way it is that experiments are multiplied without end, %0aeven to forcing the very poisons themselves to act as an¬ %0atidotes. %0a%0aCnAP. 18. (5.)-LINOZOSTIS, PARTHENION, HERMUPOA, OB 1IIK- %0a%0actjrialis ; two varieties of it : twenty-two remedies. %0a%0aLinozostis 77 or parthenion is a discovery attributed to Mer¬ %0acury : hence it is that among the Greeks it is known as %0a“hermupoa” 78 by many, while among us it is universally %0aknown as “ mercurialis.” There are two varieties of this %0aplant, the male and the female, the last possessing more %0adecided properties than the other, and having a stem a cubit in %0aheight, and sometimes branchy at the summit, with leaves %0asomewhat narrower than those of ocimum. The joints of the %0astem lie close together, and the axils are numerous: the seed %0ahangs downwards, having the joints for its basis.

In %0athe female plant the seed hangs more loosely, and is of a white %0acolour. The leaves of the male plant are swarthy, while %0athose of the female are whiter: the root, which is made no %0ause of, is very diminutive. %0a%0aBoth of these plants grow in cultivated champaign local¬ %0aities. A marvellous property is mentioned as belonging to %0athem: the male plant, they say, 80 ensures the conception of %0amale children, the female plant of females; a result which is %0aensured by drinking the juice in raisin wine, the moment after %0aconception, or by eating the leaves, boiled with oil and salt, %0aor raw with vinegar. Some persons, again, boil the plant %0ain a new earthen vessel with heliotropium and two or three %0aears of corn, till it is thoroughly done; and say that the decoc¬ %0ation should be taken in drink by the female, and the plant %0aeaten for three days successively, the regimen being com¬ %0amenced the second day of menstruation. This done, on the %0afourth day she must take a bath, immediately after which the %0asexual congress must take place. %0a%0aHippocrates 81 has lavished marvellous encomiums upon these %0aplants for the maladies of females, while at the present day %0ano physician recognizes their utility for such purpose. It was %0ahis practice to employ them for affections of the uterus, in the %0aform of a pessary, in combination with honey, rose-oil, oil of %0airis, or oil of lilies. He employed them also as an emmena- %0agogue, and for the purpose of bringing away the after-birth; %0aeffects which are equally produced, according to him, by taking %0athem in drink, or using them in the form of a fomentation. It %0awas his practice also, to inject the juice ot these plants in cases %0aof fetid odours of the ears, and then to wash the ear with old %0awine. The leaves also were used by him as a cataplasm for %0athe abdomen, defluxions of the eyes, strangury, and affections %0aof the bladder; a decoction too, of the plants is prescribed by %0ahim, with frankincense and myrrh. %0a%0aFor the purpose of relaxing 83 the bowels, or in cases of fever, %0a%0aw The male, as Fee suggests, bears no seed at all. %0a%0a811 A mere absurdity, of course. %0a%0a81 De Nat. Mul. and De Morb. Mul. B. i. and B. ii. %0a%0a8S The medicinal properties of the Mercurialis are not by any means %0aenergetic, but it is still used, Fee says, as a gentle aperient. %0a%0a%0a94 %0a%0a%0aprint's natural history. %0a%0a%0a[Cook XXV. %0a%0a%0aa handful of this plant is boiled down to one half, in two %0asextarii of water, the decoction being taken with salt and %0ahoney : if a pig’s foot or a cock is boiled with it, it will be all %0athe more beneficial. Some persons have been of opinion, that %0aas a purgative the two kinds of mercurialis ought to be used %0atogether, or else that a decoction should be made of the plant %0ain combination with mallows. These plants act as a detergent %0aupon the chest, and carry off the bilious secretions, but they are %0aapt to be injurious to the stomach. We shall have to speak %0afurther of their properties on the appropriate occasions. 83 %0a%0aCHAP. 19.- THE ACHILLEOS, SIBEKITIS, PANACES HEIIACLEON, %0a%0aMILLEFOLIUM, OR SCOPiE REGIiE ; SIX VARIETIES OF II: %0a%0aTHREE REMEDIES. %0a%0aAchilles too, the pupil of Chiron, discovered a plant which %0aheals wounds, and which, as being his discovery, is known as %0athe “ achilleos.” It was by the aid of this plant, they say. %0athat he cured Telephus. Other authorities, however, assert that %0ahe was the first 84 to discover that verdigris 85 is an extremely %0auseful ingredient in plasters ; and hence it is that he is some¬ %0atimes represented in pictures as scraping with his sword the %0arust from off a spear 86 into the wound of Telephus. Some again, %0aare of opinion that he made use of both remedies. %0a%0aBy some persons this plant is called “ panaces heracleon,” %0aby others, “ sideritis,” 87 and by the people of our country, %0a“ millefolium : ’ ,88 the stalk of it, they say, is a cubit in length, %0abranchy, and covered from the bottom with leaves somewhat %0asmaller than those of fennel. Other authorities, however, %0awhile admitting that this last plant is good for wounds, affirm %0athat the genuine achilleos has a bluish stem a foot in length, %0a%0a83 B. xxvi. ec, 74, 76, 89. %0a%0a84 Both stories are equally improbable. %0a%0a85 See B. xxxiv. c. 45. %0a%0a86 The weapons in early time, it must be remembered, were made of %0acopper or bronze. %0a%0a81 The third Sideritis of Dioscorides is thought to be the same with the %0aHeracleon siderion of c. 15 of this Book. Pliny evidently confounds the %0aAchillea and the Sideritis, totally different plants. The Achillea is identified %0aby Fee with the Achillea tomentosa or abrotonifolia of Linnaeus. As to %0athe Sideritis, see B. xxvi. c. 12. The real Panaces heracleon has been %0amentioned,in c. 12 of this Book. %0a%0a88 On -“.Thousand leaves,” probably identical with the Achillea mille¬ %0afolium of Linnaeus, milfoil or yarrow.

Others again, maintain that %0ait has a squared stem, that the heads of it are small and like %0athose of horehound, 89 and that the leaves are similar to those %0aof the quercus—they say too, that this last has the property of %0auniting the sinews when cut asunder. Another statement is, %0athat the sideritis 90 is a plant that grows on garden walls, and %0athat it emits, when bruised, a fetid smell; that there is also %0aanother plant, very similar to it, but with a whiter and more %0aunctuous leaf, a more delicate stem, and mostly found growing %0aiq vineyards. %0a%0aThey speak also of another 91 sideritis, with a stem two %0acubits in length, and diminutive branches of a triangular %0ashape: the leaf, they say, resembles that of fern, and has a %0along footstalk, the seed being similar to that of beet. All %0athese plants, it is said, are remarkably good for the treatment %0aof wounds. The one with the largest leaf is known among %0aus by the name of “scopoe regiae,” 93 and is used for the cure %0aof quinzy in swine. %0a%0aCHAP. 20. —THE. TETTCRIOTf, HEMIONTOjST, OR SPLENION : TWO %0aREMEDIES. %0a%0aAt the same period also, Teucer discovered the teucrion, a %0aplant known to some as the “ hemionion.” 93 It throws out %0athin rush-like stems, with diminutive leaves, and grows in %0arugged, uncultivated spots: the taste of it is rough, and it %0anever blossoms or produces seed. It is used for the cure of %0aaffections of the spleen, 91 and it is generally understood that %0aits properties were discovered in the following manner :—The %0aentrails cft‘ a victim having been placed upon this plant, it %0aattached itself to the milt, and entirely consumed it; 95 a %0a%0a89 “ Marrubii.” %0a%0a90 “ Ironwort.” The third Sideritis of Dioscorides, above mentioned. %0aSee c. 15 of this Book.

THE WAY IN W'UICH IT IS GATHERED, AND %0a%0aHOW THE QUALITY OF IT IS TESTED. %0a%0aThe repute of Melampus, as being highly skilled in the arts of %0adivination, is universally known. This personage has given a %0aname to one species of hellebore, known as the “ melampodion.” %0aSome persons, however, attribute the discovery of this plant %0ato a shepherd of that name, who remarked that his she-goats %0awere violently purged after browsing upon it, and afterwards %0acured the daughters of Proetus of madness, by giving them %0athe milk of these goats. It will be the best plan, therefore, to %0atake this opportunity of treating of the several varieties of %0ahellebore. The two principal kinds are the white 91 and the %0ablack; 98 though, according to most authorities, this difference %0aexists in the root only. There are some authors, however, %0awho assure us that the leaves of the black hellebore are similar %0ato those of the plane-tree, only darker, more diminutive, and %0amore jagged at the edges : and who say, that the white hel¬ %0alebore has leaves like those of beet when first shooting, %0athough at the same time of a more swarthy 7 colour, with reddish %0aveins on the under side. The stem, in both kinds, is feru- %0alaceous, a palm 99 in height, and covered with coats like those %0aof the bulbs, the root, too, being fibrous like that of the onion. 1 %0a%0a96 The Teucrium lucidum of Linnaeus: though, as Fee says, there is %0alittle similarity between it and hyssop, or between its leaves and those of %0athe bean. See B. xxiv. c. 80. %0a%0a97 Identified by Fde with the Yeratrum album and Veratrum nigrum of %0aLinnaeus, species between which there is little difference. %0a%0a98 Identified by Tournefort with the Helleborus niger of Lamarck. %0aLittre mentions the Helleborus orientalis of Linnmus. %0a%0a99 The stem of white hellebore is much longer than this. %0a%0a1 This comparison with the onion, Fee says, is altogether inexact. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 21.] %0a%0a%0aHELLEBORE. %0a%0a%0a97 %0a%0a%0aThe black hellebore kills horses, oxen, and swine ; hence it %0ais that those animals avoid it, while they eat the white 3 kind. %0aThe proper time, thay say, for gathering this last, is harvest. %0aIt grows upon Mount (Eta in great abundance; and the best %0aof all is that found upon one spot on that mountain, in the %0avicinity of Pyra. The black hellebore is found growing every¬ %0awhere, but the best is that of Mount Helicon; which is also %0aequally celebrated for the qualities of its other plants. The %0awhite hellebore of Mount (Eta is the most highly esteemed, %0athat of Pontus occupying the second place, and the produce of %0aElea the third; which last, it is generally said, grows in the %0avineyards there. The fourth rank is held by the white %0ahellebore of Mount Parnassus, though it is often adulterated %0awith that of the neighbouring districts of iEtolia. %0a%0aOf these kinds it i6 the black hellebore that is known as the %0a%0amelampodium it is used in fumigations, and for the purpose %0aof purifying houses; cattle, too, are sprinkled with it, a certain %0aform of prayer being repeated. This last plant, too, is gathered %0awith more numerous ceremonies than the other: a circle is %0afirst traced around it with a sword, after which, the person %0aabout to cut it turns towards the East, and offers up a prayer, %0aentreating permission of the gods to do so. At the same time %0ahe observes whether an eagle is in sight—for mostly while the %0aplant is being gathered that bird is near at hand—and if one %0ashould chance to fly close at hand, it is looked upon as a presage %0athat he will die within the year. The white hellebore, too, is %0agathered not without difficulty, as it is very oppressive to the %0ahead; more particularly if the precaution has not been used %0aof eating garlic first, and of drinking wine every now and %0athen, care being taken to dig up the plant as speedily as possible. %0a%0aSome persons call the black hellebore “ectomon,” 3 and %0aothers “ polyrrhizonit purges 4 by stool, while the white %0ahellebore acts as an emetic, and so carries off what might other¬ %0awise have given rise to disease.

In Italy the name given to it is “ veratrum." %0a%0aThese kinds of hellebore, reduced to powder and taken alone, %0aor else in combination with radicula, a plant used, as already %0amentioned, 8 for washing wool, act as a sternutatory, andar %0aboth of them productive of narcotic effects. The thinnest and %0ashortest roots are selected, and among them the lower parts %0ain particular, which have all the appearance of having been %0acut short ; 9 for, as to the upper part, which is the thickest, and %0abears a resemblance to an onion, it is given to dogs only, as a %0apurgative. The ancients used to select those roots the rind of %0awhich was the most fleshy, from an idea that the pith extracted %0atherefrom was of a more refined 10 nature. This substance they %0acovered with wet sponges, and, when it began to swell, used %0a10 split it longitudinally with a needle; which done, the fila¬ %0aments were dried in the shade, for future use. At the presect %0aday, however, the fibres 11 of the root with the thickest rind %0aare selected, and given to the patient just as they are. The %0abest hellebore is that which has an acrid, burning taste, and %0awhen broken, emits a sort of dust. It retains its efficacy, they %0asay, so long as thirty years. %0a%0aCHAP. 22.- TWENTY-FOUR REMEDIES DERIVED FROM BLACK HELIX- %0a%0aBORE.

Some authorities have recomended mixing scammony %0awith it, but salt is looked upon as more safe. If given in any %0aconsiderable quantity in combination with a sweet substance, %0ait is highly dangerous : used in the form of a fomentation, it %0adisperses films upon the eyes ; and hence it is that some medical %0amen have pounded it and used it for an eye-salve. It ripens %0aand acts detergently upon scrofulous sores, suppurations, and %0aindurated tumours, as also upon fistulas, but in this latter case %0ait must be removed at the end of a couple of days. In com¬ %0abination with copper filings 13 and sandarach, it removes warts; %0aand it is applied to the abdominal regions, with barley-meal %0aand wine, in cases of dropsy. %0a%0aThis plant is employed for the cure of pituitous defluxions %0ain cattle and beasts of burden, a slip of it being passed 13 %0athrough the ear, and removed at the same hour on the fol¬ %0alowing day.

Indeed, it was generally the practice to %0a•administer other substances to promote vomiting, and to carry %0aaff the hellebore by the aid of purgatives or clysters, while %0ableeding even was frequently had recourse to. In addition to %0aall this, however successful the results may prove, the symptoms %0aby which it is attended are really most alarming, by reason of %0a%0a12 “ Squama seris.” %0a%0a13 See a similar statement as to Consiligo, in B. xxvi. c. 21. %0a%0a11 See B. xv. c. 7, and B. xxiv. c. 11. %0a%0a15 Its properties, Fee says, are not more active than those of black helle¬ %0abore. %0a%0aH 2 %0a%0a%0a%0a100 %0a%0a%0aFLINT*8 NATURAL HISTORY. %0a%0a%0a[Boole XXV. %0a%0a%0athe various colours which the matter vomited presents: besides %0awhich, after the vomiting has subsided, the physician has to %0apay the greatest attention to the nature of the alvine evacu- %0aations, the due and proper use of the bath, and the general %0aregimen adopted by the patient; all of them inconveniences %0ain themselves, and preceded by the terrors naturally inspired %0aby the character of the drug ; for one story is, that it has the %0aproperty of consuming flesh, if boiled with it. %0a%0aThe great error, 16 however, on the part of the ancients wa«, %0athat in consequence of these fears, they used to give it too %0asparingly, the fact being, that the larger the dose, the more %0aspeedily it passes through the body. Themison used to give %0ano more than two drachmae, but at a later period as much as %0afour drachmae was administered ; in conformity with the cele¬ %0abrated eulogium passed upon it by Herophilus, 17 who was in %0athe habit of comparing hellebore to a valiant general, and %0asaying, that after it has set in motion all within, it is the %0afirst to sally forth and show the way. In addition to these %0aparticulars, there has been a singular discovery made: the %0ahellebore which, as we have already stated, has been cut with %0aa small pair of scissors, 18 is passed through a sieve, upon which %0athe pith makes its way through, while the outer coat remains %0abehind. The latter acts as a purgative, while the former is %0aused for the purpose of arresting vomiting when that evacuation %0ais in excess. %0a%0aCHAP. 24.- EIGHTY-EIGHT OBSERVATIONS UPON THE TWO KIMS %0a%0aOF HELLEBORE. %0a%0aIn order to secure a beneficial result, due precautions must %0abe taken not to administer hellebore in cloudy weather; for if %0agiven at such a time, it is sure to be productive of excruciating %0aagonies. Indeed there is no doubt that summer is a better %0atime for giving it than winter: the body too, by an abstinence %0afrom wine, must be prepared for it seven days previously, %0aemetics being taken on the fourth and third days before, anil %0a%0a16 Fee remarks, that they showed their wisdom in this. %0a%0a17 Herophilus, it must be remembered, lived a considerable time be:"f' %0aThemison. %0a%0ais “ Forficulis.” He probably refers to c. 21, where, however, he la %0amentioned only a needle —“ acus.” It is possibly a lapsus memories %0ahis part. %0a%0a%0a%0a3hap. 25.] %0a%0a%0aHELLEBORE. %0a%0a%0a101 %0a%0a%0a;he patient going without his evening meal the previous day. %0aWhite hellebore, too, is administered in a sweet 19 medium, %0athough lentils or pottage are found to be the best for the pur¬ %0apose. There has been a plan also, lately discovered, of splitting %0ai radish, and inserting the hellebore in it, after which the %0asections arc pressed together; the object being that the strength %0a)f the hellebore may be incorporated with the radish, and mo- %0aiified thereby. %0a%0aAt the end of about four hours it generally begins to be %0anought up again ; and within seven it has operated to the full %0a;xtent. Administered in this manner, it is good for epilepsy, %0ais already 20 stated, vertigo, melancholy, insanity, delirium, %0aivhite elephantiasis, leprosy, tetanus, palsy, gout, dropsy, in- %0alipient tympanitis, stomachic affections, cynic spasms, 21 sciatica, %0ajuartan fevers which defy all other treatment, chronic coughs, %0aiatulency, and recurrent gripings in the bowels. %0a%0aCHAP. 25.-TO WHAT PERSONS HELLEBORE SHOULD NEVER BE %0a%0aADMINISTERED. %0a%0aIt is universally recommended not to give hellebore to aged %0apeople or children, to persons of a soft and effeminate habit of %0aiody or mind, or of a delicate or tender constitution. It is given %0a.ess frequently too to females than to males; and persons of a %0admorous disposition are recommended not to take it: the same %0adso, in cases where the viscera are ulcerated or tumefied, and %0anore particularly when the patient is afflicted with spitting of %0a)lood, or with maladies of the side or fauces. Hellebore is ap- %0a)lied, too, externally, with salted axle-grease, to morbid eruptions %0a)f the body and suppurations of long standing: mixed with %0aipolenta, it destroys rats and mice. The people of Gaul, when %0aHinting, tip their arrow’s with hellebore, taking care to cut %0alway the parts about the wound in the animal so slain: the %0aHesh, they say, is all the more tender for it. Flies are destroyed %0awith white hellebore, bruised and sprinkled about a place with %0amilk : phthiriasis is also cured by the use of this mixture. %0a%0a19 This he has stated to be attended with danger, in the case of black %0alellebore, should the dose be too strong. %0a%0a20 In c. 21 of this Book. %0a%0a51 Twitcliings of the mouth, which cause the patient to show his teeth, %0aike a dog. %0a%0a%0a102 %0a%0a%0apliny's natural history. %0a%0a%0a[Book XXV. %0a%0a%0aCHAP. 26.

This plant, he says, %0ais a cubit in height, and has a square stem, branchy, covered %0awith downy leaves, and resembling the quercus 24 in appearance: %0ait is found growing in Pontus, in rich, humid soils, and has a %0abitter taste. %0a%0aThere is another 25 variety also of this plant, with a larger %0aleaf, and resembling wild mint in appearance. They are both %0aof them used for numerous purposes, both individually and in %0acombination with other ingredients, as antidotes. %0a%0aCHAP. 28. -THE POLEMONIA, PHILETiERIA, OK CHILI0DYNA5ICS: %0a%0aSIX REMEDIES. %0a%0aThe polemonia 26 is known as the “ philetseria” by some, in %0aconsequence of the contest which has arisen between certain %0akings for the honour of its discovery. The people of Cappa¬ %0adocia also give it the name of “ chiliodynamus.” 21 The root of %0ait is substantial, and it has slender branches, with umbels %0a%0a22 Caesalpinus identifies it with the Erythronium dens canis of Linnaeus, %0aand Commerson and Sehreiber with the Dorstenia tambourissaof Sonnerat. %0aFee is probably right in considering its synonym as still unknown. %0a%0a23 Hardouin identifies it with the Stachys Germanica, Linnaeus and %0aSprengel with the Nepeta scordotis of Linnaeus, and Fee with the Stachys %0aPaloestina. %0a%0a24 Fee remarks, that none of the plants mentioned in the last Note bear %0aany resemblance to the “ quercus,” or oak. %0a%0a25 Probably tue Teucrium scorodor.ia of Linnaeus, Fee says; though,as %0ahe remarks, the description might apply to many of the Labiate. %0a%0a26 Its names were derived from Polemon, a king of Pontus, and Phile- %0ataerus, a king of Cappadocia. It is generally identified with the Pole %0amonium caeruleum or Linnaeus, Greek valerian, or Jacob’s ladder. M %0aFmas suggests that it may be the Hypericum Olympicum of Linnaeus, %0awith which he also identifies the Panaces chironion. %0a%0aa “ With a thousand virtues.” %0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 30.] %0a%0a%0aCENTAUBION. %0a%0a%0a103 %0a%0a%0ahanging from the extremities, and a black seed.

The leaves, arranged at regular intervals, resemble %0athose of cinquefoil or hemp; they have five indentations at the %0aedge, and are swarthy like the stem, and downy. The root is %0anever used. The seed, taken in wine, is a sovereign remedy %0afor dysentery. %0a%0aCHAP. 30. -CENTAUKION OR CHIRONION : TWENTY REMEDIES. %0a%0aCentaury, 29 it is said, effected a cure for Chiron, on the %0aoccasion when, while handling the arms of Hercules, his %0aguest, he let one of the arrows fall upon his foot: hence it is %0athat by some it is called “ chironion.” The leaves of it are %0alarge and oblong, serrated at the edge, and growing in %0athick tufts from the root upwards. The stems, some three %0acubits in height and jointed, bear heads resembling those of %0athe poppy. The root is large and spreading, of a reddish %0acolour, tender and brittle, a couple of cubits in length, and full %0aof a bitter juice, somewhat inclining to sweet. %0a%0aThis plant grows in rich soils upon declivities; the best in %0aquality being that of Arcadia, Elis, Messenia, Mount Pholoe, and %0aMount Lycmus: it grows also upon the Alps, and in numerous %0aother localities, and in Lycia they prepare a lycium 30 from it. %0a8o remarkable are its properties for closing wounds, that %0apieces of meat even, it is said, are soldered together, when boiled %0awith it. The root is the only part in use, being administered %0ain doses of two drachmae in the several cases hereafter 31 men- %0a%0a28 So called probably from a king Eupator.

It is similar to origanum %0ain appearance, except that the leaves are narrower and longer. %0aThe stem is angular, branchy, and a palm in height; the flower %0ais like that of the lychnis, 31 and the root is thin, and never %0aused. It is in the juice that its medicinal properties are %0acentred: it being gathered in the autumn, and the juice extracted %0afrom the leaves. Some persons cut up the stalks, and steep %0athem for some eighteen days in water, and then extract the %0ajuice. %0a%0aIn Italy this kind of centaury is known as “gall 34 of the %0aearth,” from its extreme bitterness. The Gauls give it the %0aname of “ exacum ;” 36 from the circumstance that, taken in %0adrink, it purges off all noxious substances by alvine evacuation. %0a%0aCHAP. 32.-THE CENTAURIS TRIORCHIS : TWO REMEDIES. %0a%0aThere is a third kind of centaury also, known as the %0a“ centauris triorchis.” 37 It is but rarely that a person cuts it %0awithout wounding himself.

Fee is probably %0aright in his conjecture that the Centaurea centaureum is meant; though %0aBrotier and Desfontaines look upon this as being a distinct plant, and %0aidentify it with the Rumex sanguineus of Linnmus. %0a%0a38 The root of the greater centaury, Fee remarks, is of a deep red within. %0a%0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 34.] %0a%0a%0aGENTIAN. %0a%0a%0a105 %0a%0a%0athe protection of the triorchis, a kind of hawk, which attacks %0athose who gather it; a circumstance to which it owes its %0aname.

This %0aplant has green leaves resembling those of the willow, and a %0apurple 47 blossom: it has all the appearance of a shrub, the %0abranches are erect, and it has a pungent smell. It is found %0agrowing in watery soils.

It is a %0aplant with numerous branches, like those of wormwood, but %0athe leaves of it are larger and substantial. %0a%0aThere are two varieties of it; one has broader 50 leaves than %0athe other, 51 which last is of a slender form, with a more diminu¬ %0ative leaf, and grows nowhere but in maritime districts. %0a%0a46 A king of Thrace, contemporary with Alexander the Great.

In addi¬ %0ation to this name, this last plant is known as “botrys ” to some %0apersons, and “ ambrosia” to others : 63 it grows in Cappadocia. %0a%0aCUAP. 37. -NYMPHAJA, HERACLEON, RHOPALON, OR MADON ; TWO %0a%0aVARIETIES OF IT : FOUR REMEDIES. %0a%0aThe plant called “nymphaea,” owes its name, they say, to a %0aNymph who died of jealousy conceived on account of Hercules, %0afor which reason it is also known as “ heracleon” by some. By %0aother persons, again, it is called “ rhopalon,” from the resem¬ %0ablance of its root to a club. 84 * * * * and hence it is that %0athose who take it in drink become impotent for some twelve %0adays, and incapacitated for procreation. That of the first %0aquality is found in Orchomenia and at Marathon : the people of %0aBoeotia call it “ madon, ” and use the seed for food. It grows %0ain spots covered with water; the leaves 65 of it are large, and %0afloat upon the surface, while others are to be seen springing %0afrom the roots below. The flower is very similar to a lily %0ain appearance, and after the plant has shed its blossom, the %0aplace of the flower is occupied by a head like that of the %0apoppy.

With reference to euphorbia, 61 there %0ais a treatise still in existence, written upon it by Xing Juba, %0ain which he highly extols its merits : he discovered it growing %0aupon Mount Atlas, and describes it as resembling a thyrsus in %0aappearance, and bearing leaves like those of the acanthus.® %0a%0aThe properties of this plant are so remarkably powerful, 0 %0athat the persons engaged in collecting the juices of it are %0aobliged to stand at a considerable distance. The incisions are %0amade with a long pole shod with iron, the juice flowing into %0areceivers of kid-leather placed beneath. The juice has all the %0aappearance of milk, as it exudes, but when it has coagulated %0aand dried, it assumes the form and consistency of frankincense. %0aThe persons engaged in collecting it, find their sight improved 61 %0athereby. This juice is an excellent remedy for the stings of %0aserpents : in whatever part of the body the wound may have %0abeen inflicted, the practice is to make an incision in the crown %0aof the head, and there introduce the medicament.

There are two varieties ; one, more diminu¬ %0ative 69 than the other, has a narrower and more swarthy leaf, %0astrongly resembling a sheep’s tongue in appearance : the stem %0aof it is angular and bends downwards, and it is generally found %0agrowing in meadow lands. The larger 70 kind has leaves %0aenclosed with ribs at the sides, to all appearance, from the %0afact of which being seven 71 in number, the plant has been %0acalled “ heptapleuron” 72 by some. The stem of it is a cubit in %0aheight, aud strongly resembles that of the turnip. That %0awhich is grown in a moist soil is considered much the most %0aefficacious : it is possessed of marvellous virtues as a desiccative %0aand as an astringent, and has all the effect of a cautery.

It is very likely, however, that it %0awould tend, like any other cheese, to appease hunger, though, probably, %0anot thirst. %0a%0a86 He has probably invented this reason himself, as it is hardly probable %0athat the Scythians would feed their horses with cheese, even though made %0afrom mare’s milk. %0a%0a87 Sprengel identifies it with the Andropogon ischanuon of Linnaeus, the %0aWoolly andropogon.

This plant is found mostly %0agrowing in the vicinity of ancient monuments, old walls, and %0aovergrown footpaths: it is an evergreen, and its leaves are %0alike those of nasturtium, with a stem a cubit in height, and a %0aseed so diminutive as to be hardly perceptible ; the root, too, %0ahas just the smell of nasturtium. Its properties are more %0astrongly developed in summer, and it is only used fresh- %0agathered : there is considerable difficulty in pounding it. %0a%0aMixed with a small proportion of axle-grease, it is extremely %0auseful for sciatica and all diseases of the joints ; the application %0abeing kept on some four hours at the utmost, when used by %0athe male sex, and about half that time in the case of females. %0aImmediately after its removal, the patient must take a warm %0abath, and then anoint the body all over with oil and wine— %0athe same operation being repeated every twenty days, so long %0aas there are any symptoms of pain remaining. A similar %0amethod is adopted for the cure of all internal defluxions; it %0a%0a94 Sprengel and other commentators identify it with the Pulmonaria %0aofficinalis of Linnaeus, Lungwort or Pulmonary. Others, again, consider it %0ato be the Veratrum album of Linnaeus, or White hellebore. Fee considers %0athat its synonym has not hitherto been discovered. Holland calls it Bear- %0afoot. 96 B. xxvi. c. 21. %0a%0a97 Fee identifies it with the Lepidium graminifolium of Linnaeus, Grass¬ %0aleaved pepperwort; Desfontaines with the L.

Littre gives as its synonym the Iberis amara of Linnaeus, %0athe White candy-tuft. %0a%0a98 “ Fictum nomen.” Salmasius thinks that by these words, Pliny %0ameans that Democrates invented the name of a friend of his as being the %0adiscoverer of this plant, which in reality was discovered by himself. It %0awould seem to mean, however, that the name “ iberis ” was only a fanciful %0atitle, derived from the country where it was found, and given to it for want %0aof acquaintance with its real name. %0a%0a99 Still preserved in Galen, B. x. c. 2. %0a%0aVOL.

There are two %0avarieties of this plant; the larger 1 kind has a branchy stem, and %0aa leaf somewhat similar to that of the wild parsnip , 2 * but %0alarger. The plant itself is some two cubits in height, and of %0aa whitish colour, that of the flower being yellow. The smaller* %0akind has leaves like those of ivy, only rounder and not so %0awhite.

This plant grows nowhere 11 but in Crete. The %0abranches of it are remarkably thin; it resembles pennyroyal %0ain appearance, and is hot and acrid to the taste.

Indeed, the Arcadians, they say, are %0ain the habit of using, not the simples themselves, but milk, %0ain the spring season more particularly ; a period at which the %0afield plants are swollen with juice, and the milk is medicated %0aby their agency. It is cows’ milk in especial that they use %0afor this purpose, those animals being in the habit of feeding %0aupon nearly every kind of plant.

A third 21 variety is extremely thin and long, similar to %0aa young vine in appearance : it has the most strongly-marked %0aproperties of them all, and is known by the additional names %0aof “ clematitis,” and “cretica.” All these plants are the %0acolour of boxwood, have a slender stem, and bear a purple flower %0aand small berries like those of the caper : the root is the only %0apart that is possessed of any virtues. %0a%0aThere is also a fourth 22 kind, the name given to which is %0a“ plistolochiait is more slender than the one last mentioned, %0ahas a root thickly covered with filaments, and is about as thick %0aas a good-sized bulrush : another name given to it is “polyr- %0arhizos.” The smell of all these plants is medicinal, but that of %0athe one with an oblong root and a very slender stem, is the most %0aagreeable : this last, in fact, which has a fleshy outer coat, is %0awell adapted as an ingredient for nardine unguents even. They %0agrow in rich champaign soils, and the best time for gathering %0athem is harvest; after the earth is scraped from off them, they %0aare put by for keeping. %0a%0aThe aristolochia that is the most esteemed, however, is that %0a%0a17 “Most excellent for pregnancy.” 18 See B. xxvi. c. 56. %0a%0a19 Identified by Fee with the Aristolochia rotunda of Linnaeus, Bounded %0abirthwort, a native of the south of France and the southern parts of %0aEurope. Littre gives the Aristolochia pallida of Willdenow. %0a%0a20 Most probably the Aristolochia longa of Linnaeus, found in France, %0aSpain, Portugal, and Italy. Littre gives as its synonym the Aristolochia %0aparvifolia of Sibthorp. %0a%0a21 The Aristolochia clematis of Linnaeus, almost identical with the %0aAristolochia Cretica and Baetica. %0a%0a22 The Aristolochia plistolochia of Linnaeus, the Spanish branching %0astemmed birthwort. Fee thinks that these identifications, though probable %0aenough, are not altogether satisfactory, and that the Greeks may have made %0athese distinctions between varieties of the plant comparatively unknown to %0athe rest of Europe.

For a %0asimilar purpose also, the root of the greater centaury is taken, %0ain doses of one drachma to three cyathi of white wine. Gentian, %0atoo, is particularly good for the stings of snakes, taken either %0afresh or dried, in doses of two drachmae, mixed with rue and %0apepper in six cyathi of wine. The odour, too, of lysima- %0achia 55 puts serpents to flight. %0a%0aChelidonia 84 is also given in wine to persons who have been %0astung; and betony in particular is used as an external appli¬ %0acation to the wound, a plant the virtues of which are so ex¬ %0atraordinary, it is said, that if a circle of it is traced around a %0aserpent, it will lash itself to death 35 with its tail. The seed %0aof this plant is also administered in such cases, in doses of one %0adenarius to three cyathi of wine ; or else it is dried and pow¬ %0adered, and applied to the wound, in the proportion of three %0adenarii of powder to one sextarius of water. %0a%0aCantabrica, dittany, and aristolochia, are also similarly used, %0aone drachma of the root of this last plant being taken every %0anow and then in a semisextarius of wine.

The male 43 agaric is firmer than %0athe other, and more bitter; it is productive too of head-ache. %0aThe female plant is of a looser texture ; it has a sweet taste at %0afirst, which speedily changes into a bitter flavour. %0a%0aCHAP. 58. -THE ECHIOS ; THREE VARIETIES OF IT : TWO REMEDIES. %0a%0aOf the echios there are two kinds; one 44 of which resembles %0apennyroyal in appearance, and has a concave leaf. It is ad¬ %0aministered, in doses of two drachmae, in four cyathi of wine. %0aThe other 45 kind is distinguished by a prickly down, and bears %0asmall heads resembling those of vipers : it is usually taken in %0awine and vinegar. Some persons give the name of “ echios %0apersonata” 46 to a kind of echios with larger leaves than the %0aothers, and burrs of considerable size, resembling that of the %0alappa. 47 The root of this plant is boiled and administered in %0avinegar. %0a%0a’ !9 It is supposed by commentators that he is in error here, and that this %0adescription applies to the Lappa canaria, mentioned in B. xxiv. c. 116. %0a%0a40 The root of the Papaver argemone has no such smell. %0a%0a41 See B. xxi. c. 94, B. xxiv. c. 116, and B. xxvi. c. 59. %0a%0a42 The Boletus agaricum of Aiton, or White agaric.

There %0aare two varieties of it: the one that is thickly covered with %0aleaves 53 is thought to be the female plant; that with fewer %0aleaves, 54 the male. Both kinds have numerous thin branches, %0aa cubit in length, and of an angular form. The leaves are %0asmaller than those of the quercus, and narrower, with larger %0aindentations. The flower is of a grey colour, and the root %0ais long and thin. This plant is to be found growing every¬ %0awhere, in level humid localities. Some persons make no %0adistinction between these two varieties, and look upon them as %0aidentical, from the circumstance of their being productive of %0aprecisely similar effects. %0a%0aThe people in the Gallic provinces make use of them both for %0asoothsaying purposes, and for the prediction of future events ; %0abut it is the magicians more particularly that give utterance to %0asuch ridiculous follies in reference to this plant. Persons, they %0atell us, if they rub themselves with it will be sure to gain the %0aobject of their desires ; and they assure us that it keeps away %0afevers, conciliates friendship, and is a cure for every possible %0adisease; they say, too, that it must be gathered about tbe %0arising of the Dog-star—but so as not to be shone upon by sun %0aor moon—and that honey-combs and honey must be first pre¬ %0asented to the earth by way of expiation.

The most esteemed kind is that %0aof Crete, 65 the next best being the produce of Achaia, and of %0aall dry localities. It resembles fennel in appearance, only %0athat its leaves are whiter, more diminutive, and hairy on the %0asurface. The stem is upright, and a foot in length, and the root %0ahas a remarkably pleasant taste and smell. This kind grows %0ain stony localities with a southern aspect. %0a%0aThe inferior sorts are found growing everywhere, upon de¬ %0aclivities for instance, and in the hedges of fields, but always in %0aa rich soil. The leaves are like those of coriander, 68 the stem %0abeing a cubit in length, the heads round, often three or more in %0anumber, and the root ligneous, and good for nothing when %0adry. The seed of this kind is like that of cummin, while that %0aof the first kind bears a resemblance to millet; in all cases %0ait is white, acrid, hot, and odoriferous. The seed of the %0asecond kind has more active properties than that of the first; %0afor which reason it should be used more sparingly. %0a%0aIf it is considered really desirable to recognize a third %0a%0a•a Identified by Fee with the Sparganium ramosum of Linnaeus, or %0aBranchy burr-reed. Littre gives the Butonus umbellatus of Linnaeus, the %0aFlowering rush, or Water gladiole. %0a%0a61 Fee remarks, that the account given by Pliny has not the same pre¬ %0acision as that of Dioscorides, who describes three varieties of the Daucus. %0a%0a64 F%3c$e is inclined to identify the Daucus of Crete and Achaia with the %0aDaucus Creticus of Fuchsius, the Athamanta annua of Linnaeus. Des- %0afontaines identifies it with the Athamanta Cretensis of Linnaeus. %0a%0a66 This kind is identified by Fee with the Seseli ammoides of Linnaeus, %0aand hy Littre with the Ammi majus of Linnaeus, the Common or Greater %0abishop's weed. %0a%0a%0a124 %0a%0a%0aflint’s natural history. %0a%0a%0a[ B*ok XXV. %0a%0a%0avariety of the daucus, there is a plant 07 of this nature very %0asimilar to the staphylinos, known as the “ pastinaca 6 * erratica,” %0awith an oblong seed and a sw r eet root. Quadrupeds will touch %0anone of these plants, either in winter or in summer, except %0aindeed, after abortion. 69 The seed of the various kinds is used, %0awith the exception of that of Crete, in which case it is the %0aroot that is employed ; this root being particularly useful for the %0astings of serpents. The proper dose is one drachma, taken in %0awine. It is administered also to cattle when stung by those %0areptiles. %0a%0a%0aCHAP. 65. -THE THERIONARCA t TWO REMEDIES. %0a%0aThe therionarca, altogether a different plant from that of %0athe Magi, 70 grows in our own climates, and is a branchy plant, %0awith greenish leaves, and a rose-coloured flower. It has a %0adeadly effect upon serpents, and the very contact of it is suf¬ %0aficient to benumb 71 a wild beast, of whatever kind it be. %0a%0aCHAP. 66.-THE PERSOLATA OR ARCION ; EIGHT REMEDIES. %0a%0aThe persolata, 72 a plant known to every one, and called %0a“ arcion” by the Greeks, has a leaf, larger, thicker, more %0aswarthy, and more hairy than that of the gourd even, with a %0alarge white root. This plant also is taken, in doses of two %0adenarii, in wine. %0a%0a67 Identified by Sprengel with the Daucus Mauritanicus, and hy Brotero %0aand Desfontaines with the Daucus carota, var. a, our Common carrot. Fee %0aseems inclined to identify it with the Athamanta cervaria of Linnaeus, %0aMountain carrot, or Broad-leaved spignel. The account given by Pliny %0ais, however, a mass of confusion. %0a%0a68 Or “ wild parsnip.” See B. xix. c. 27. %0a%0a69 For the purpose of expelling the dead foetus, according to Dioscorides, %0aB. iii. c. 83. %0a%0a10 See B. xxiv. c. 102.

They are destitute, however, of %0aall poisonous qualities. %0a%0a71 Hence its name—“ Benumbing wild beasts.” %0a%0a72 Fee thinks that there is an error in the name, and that it is the “per- %0asonata” that is here spoken of, the plant already mentioned in c. 58 of %0athis Book. Hardouin identifies it with the Tussilago petasites—the Butter- %0aburr, according to Nemnich—but apparently without anv sufficient au¬ %0athority. %0a%0a%0aChap. 68.] %0a%0a%0aTHE CYCLAMINOS CISSANTHEMOS. %0a%0a%0a125 %0a%0a%0aCHAP. 67. —CYCLAMINOS OR TUBER TERRJE : TWELVE REMEDIES. %0a%0aSo too, the root of cyclaminos 73 is good for injuries inflicted %0aby serpents of all kinds. It has leaves smaller than those of %0aivy, thinner, more swarthy, destitute of angles, and covered %0awith whitish spots. The stem is thin and hollow, the flowers %0aof a purple colour, and the root large and covered with a %0ablack rind; so much so, in fact, that it might almost be taken %0afor the root of rape. This plant grows in umbrageous local¬ %0aities, and by the people of our country is known as the ‘Huber %0aterrae.” 74 It ought to be grown in every house, if there is any %0atruth in the assertion that wherever it grows, noxious spells %0acan have no effect. This plant is also what is called an %0a“ amuletand taken in wine, they say, it produces, all the %0asymptoms and appearances of intoxication. The root is dried, %0acut in pieces, like the squill, and put away for keeping. When %0awanted, a decoction is made of it, of the consistency of honey. %0aStill, however, it has some deleterious 75 properties; and. a %0apregnant woman, it is said, if she passes over the root of it, %0awill be sure to miscarry. %0a%0aCHAr. 68.-THE CYCLAMINOS CISSANTHEMOS : FOUR REMEDIES. %0a%0aThere is also another kind of cyclaminos, known by the ad¬ %0aditional name of “ cissanthemos ;”‘ 6 the stems of it, which are %0ajointed, are good for nothing.

The stem resembles that of %0afennel, is thin and long, covered with leaves close to the ground, %0aand terminating in athick black juicy root, with apowerful smell. %0aIt grows on umbrageous mountains, and is taken up at the end %0aof autumn. The largest and tenderest roots are the most es¬ %0ateemed ; they are cut with bone-knives into slips four fingers %0ain length, and left to shed their juice 79 in the shade ; the persons %0aemployed taking the precaution of rubbing the head and nos¬ %0atrils with rose-oil, as a preservative against vertigo. %0a%0aThere is also another kind of juice, which adheres to the %0astems, and exudes from incisions made therein. It is con¬ %0asidered best when it has arrived at the consistency of honey: %0athe colour of it is red, and it has a strong but agreeable smell, %0aand a hot, acrid taste. This juice, as well as the root and a %0adecoction of it, enters into the composition of numerous medica¬ %0aments, but the juice has the most powerful properties of %0athe two. Diluted with bitter almonds or rue, it is taken in %0adrink as a remedy for injuries inflicted by serpents. Rubbed %0aupon the body with oil, it is a preservative against the attacks %0aof those reptiles. %0a%0a17 According to Brotero, it is the Parnassia palustris of Toumefort, an %0aopinion with which Fee is inclined to agree. Sprengel considers it to be %0athe same as the Convallaria bifolia of Linnaeus, our Small lily of the valley, %0aand identifies it with the one-leafed Ceratia of B. xxvi. c. 34.

For %0athe bite of the phalangium, vervain is employed, in combina¬ %0ation with wine or oxycrate: cinquefoil, too, and daucus, are %0aused for a similar purpose. %0a%0aCHAP. 73. —PHEOMOS OR VERBASCUM : FIFTEEN REMEDIES. %0a%0aVerbascum has the name of “ phlomos” with the Greeks. %0aOf this plant there are two principal kinds; the white, 83 which %0ais considered to be the male, and the black, 84 thought to be the %0afemale. There is a third 85 kind, also, which is only found in %0athe woods. The leaves of these plants are larger than those of %0athe cabbage, and have a hairy surface: the stem is upright, and %0amore than a cubit in height, and the seed black, and never %0aused. The root is single, and about the thickness of the finger. %0aThe two principal kinds are found growing in champaign locali¬ %0aties. The wild verbascum has leaves like those of elelisphacus, 86 %0abut of an elongated form; the branches are ligneous. %0a%0aCnAP. 74.- THE PHLOMIS : ONE REMEDY. THE LYCHNITIS OR %0a%0aTHRYALLIS. %0a%0aThere are also two 87 varieties of the phlomis, hairy plants, %0a%0a80 Or Wall-wort. See B. xxiv. c. 35. and B. xxvi. c. 49. %0a%0a81 See c. 28 of this Book. 82 See c. 54 of this Book. %0a%0a83 Identified by Fee with the Verbascum thapsus of Linnaeus, Great %0amullein, High-taper, or Cow’s lung-wort. %0a%0a81 Identified by Fee with the Verbascum sinuatum of Linnaeus. Des- %0afontaines considers this to be the male plant of Pliny, and the V. thapsus %0ato be the female. %0a%0a85 Fee considers this to be the same as the Blattaria mentioned in c. 60, %0aand identifies it with the Verbascum phlomo'ides of Linnaeus. Sprengel %0aand Desfontaines consider it to be the Phlomis lychnitis of Linnaeus. Littre %0agives the Phlomis fruticosa of Linnaeus, the Jerusalem sage, or Tree sage. %0a%0a86 See B. xxii. c 71. %0a%0a81 Fee identifies these two kinds with the Phlomis fruticosa of Linnaeus ; %0a%0a%0a128 %0a%0a%0aplint’s natural history. %0a%0a%0a[Dook Xiv. %0a%0a%0awith rounded leaves, and but little elevated above the surface %0aof the earth. A third kind, again, is known as the “ lychnitis”* %0aby some persons, and as the “ tliryallis” by others : it has three %0aleaves only, or four at the very utmost, thick and unctuous, %0aand well adapted for making wicks for lamps. The leaves of %0athe phlomos which we have mentioned as the female plant, if %0awrapped about figs, will preserve them most efficiently from %0adecay, it is said. It seems little better than a loss of time to %0agive the distinguishing characteristics of these three" kinds, %0athe effects of them all being precisely the same. %0a%0aFor injuries inflicted by scorpions, an infusion of the root %0ais taken, with rue, in water. Its bitterness is intense, but it %0ais quite as efficacious as the plants already mentioned. %0a%0aCHAP. 75. -THE THliLYPHONON OR SCORPIO : ONE REMEDY. %0a%0aThe thelyphonon 90 is a plant known as the “scorpio” to some, %0afrom the peculiar form of its roots, the very touch of which %0akills 91 the scorpion: hence it is that it is taken in drink for stings %0ainflicted by those reptiles. If a dead scorpion is rubbed with %0awhite hellebore, it will come to life, they say. The thelypho¬ %0anon is fatal to all quadrupeds, on the application of the root to %0athe genitals. The leaf too, which bears a resemblance to that %0aof cyclaminos, is productive of a similar effect, in the course of %0athe same day. It is a jointed plant, and is found growing in %0aunbrageous localities. Juice of betony or of plantago is a %0apreservative against the venom of the scorpion. %0a%0aCHAP. 76. -THE PHRYNION, NEURAS, OR POTERION ; ONE %0a%0aREMEDY. %0a%0aFrogs, too, have their venom, the bramble-frog 92 in particular, %0a%0aSprengel and Desfontaines consider the second kind to be the Phlomis %0aItalica of Smith; on insufficient grounds, Fee thinks. Littre mentions %0athe Sideritis Itomana and S. elegans of Linnaeus. %0a%0a88 The “ Lamp plant.” It is mostly identified with the Verbascum %0alychnitis of Linnaeus, the White mullein. Fee is somewhat doubtful on %0athe point. It is doubtful whether it is not the same as the Thryallis, men¬ %0ationed in B. xxi. c. 61. Littre identifies it with the Phlomis lychnitis. %0a%0a89 In the last paragraph he is speaking of the Phlomos, here he evidently %0areverts to the Phlomis. %0a%0a8° Or “ Female killer.” See B. xxvii. c. 2. %0a%0a91 Dioscorides states, somewhat more rationally, that this plant strikes %0athe scorpion with torpor, and that the contact of hellebore revives it. %0a%0a92 “ Iiubetis.” A kind of toad, probably. See B. viii. c. 48, B. xi c. %0a16, and B. xxxii. c. 18. %0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 77.] %0a%0a%0aTHE ALISHA. %0a%0a%0a129 %0a%0a%0aand I myself have seen the Psylli, in their exhibitions, %0airritate them by placing them upon flat vessels made red hot, 53 %0atheir bite being fatal more instantaneously than the sting even %0aof the asp. One remedy for their poison is the phrynion, 94 %0ataken in wine, which has also the additional names of “neuras” 95 %0aand “ poterion it bears a small flower, and has numerous %0afibrous roots, with an agreeable smell. %0a%0aCHAP. 77. — THE ALISMA, DAMASONION, OR LYRON : SEVENTEEN %0aREMEDIES. %0a%0aSimilar, too, are the properties of the alisma, 96 known to some %0apersons as the “ damasonion,” and as the “ lyron ” to others. %0aThe leaves of it would be exactly those of the plantago, were it %0anot that they are narrower, more jagged at the edges, and %0abent downwards in a greater degree. In other respects, they %0apresent the same veined appearance as those of the plantago. %0aThis plant has a single stem, slender, a cubit in height, and %0aterminated by a spreading head. 97 The roots of it are nume¬ %0arous, thin like those of black hellebore, acrid, unctuous, and %0aodoriferous: it is found growing in watery localities. %0a%0aThere is another kind also, which grows in the woods, of a %0amore swarthy colour, and with larger leaves. The root of %0athem both is used for injuries inflicted by frogs and by the %0asea-hare, 98 in doses of one drachma taken in wine. Cycla- %0aminos, too, is an antidote for injuries inflicted by the sea-hare. %0a%0aThe bite of the mad dog has certain venomous properties, %0aas an antidote to which we have the cynorrhodos, of which %0a%0a93 Schneider, on Nicander’s Alexiph. p. 277, says that he cannot under¬ %0astand this passage. There is little doubt that Sillig is right in his con¬ %0ajecture that it is imperfect, for the pith of the narrative, whatever it may %0ahave been, is evidently wanting. The Psylli^were said to be proof against %0aall kinds of poisons. See B. viii. c. 38, and B. xi. c. 30; also Lucan’s %0aPharsalia, B. ix. 1. 192, et seq. %0a%0a94 See also B. xxvii. c. 97.

It has no medicinal properties, %0athough it was esteemed till very recent times as curative of hydrophobia. %0a%0a97 “Capite thyrsi.” %0a%0a98 See B. ix. c. 72, and B. xxxii. c. 3. %0a%0aTOL.

The plantago is useful %0afor the bites of all kinds of animals, either taken in drink or %0aapplied topically to the part affected. Betony is taken on %0asimilar occasions, in old wine, unmixed. %0a%0aCHAP. 78. -PER1STEREOS : SIX REMEDIES. %0a%0aThe name of peristereos 1 is given to a plant with a tall stem, %0acovered with leaves, and throwing out other stems from the top. %0aIt is much sought by pigeons, to which circumstance it %0aowes its name. Dogs will never bark, they say, at persons %0awho have this plant about them. %0a%0aCHAP. 79. -REMEDIES AGAINST CERTAIN POISONS. %0a%0aClosely approaching in their nature to these various kinds of %0apoisons, are those which have been devised by man for his own %0adestruction. In the number of antidotes to all these artificial %0apoisons as well as to the spells of sorcery, the very first place %0amust be accorded to the moly 3 of Homer; next to which come %0athe mithridatia, 3 scordotis, 4 and centaury. The seed of betony %0acarries off all kinds of noxious substances by stool; being taken %0afor the purpose in honied wine or raisin wine, or else pulverized, %0aand taken, in doses of one drachma, in four cyathi of old wine : %0ain this last case, however, the patient must bring it off the %0astomach by vomit and then repeat the dose. Persons who %0aaccustom themselves to take this plant daily, will never ex¬ %0aperience any injury, they say, from substances of a poisonous %0anature. %0a%0aWhen a person has taken poison, one most powerful remedy %0ais aristolochia, 5 taken in the same proportions as those used for %0ainjuries inflicted by serpents. 6 The juice, too, of cinquefoil is %0agiven for a similar purpose ; and in both cases, after the patient %0ahas vomited, agaric is acftninistered, in doses of one denarius, in %0athree cyathi of hydromel. %0a%0a99 In c. 6 of this Book. %0a%0a1 “Pigeon-plant.” The same as Vervain, already described in c. 59of %0athis Book. ' 2 See c. 8 of this Book. %0a%0a3 By “ Mithridatia ” he probably means the antidotes attributed to %0aMithridates in c. 3 of this Book, and in B. xxix. c. 8, and not the plant %0apreviously mentioned in c. 26. %0a%0a4 See c.. 27 of this Book. %0a%0a6 See c. 55. %0a%0a%0a5 See c. 54 of this Book. %0a%0a%0aChap. 82.] THE PERICARPUM. 131 %0a%0aCHAP. 80. —THE ANTIRRHINUM, ANARBHINON, OB LYCHNIS AGRIA : %0a%0aTHREE REMEDIES. %0a%0aThe name of antirrhinum 7 or anarrhinon is given to the %0alychnis agria, 8 a plant which resembles flax in appearance, is %0adestitute of root, has a flower like that of the hyacinth, and %0aa seed similar in form to the muzzle of a calf. According to %0awhat the magicians say, persons who rub themselves with this %0aplant improve their personal appearance thereby; and they %0amay ensure themselves against all noxious substances and %0apoisons, by wearing it as a bracelet. %0a%0aCHAP. 81. —EUCLEA : ONE REMEDY. %0a%0aThe same is the case, too, with the plant to which they give %0athe name of “euclea,” 9 and which, they tell us, rubbed upon %0athe person, will ensure a more extended consideration. They %0asay, too, that if a person carries artemisia 10 about him, he will %0abe ensured against all noxious drugs, the attacks of wild beasts %0aof every kind, and sunstroke even. This last plant is taken %0aalso in wine, in cases of poisoning by opium. Used as an %0aamulet, or taken in drink, it is said to be particularly effica¬ %0acious for injuries inflicted by frogs. %0a%0aCHAP. 82. -THE PERICARPUM ; TWO VARIETIES OF IT : TWO %0a%0aREMEDIES. %0a%0aThe pericarpum is a kind of bulbous plant. There are two %0avarieties of it; one with a red I 11 outer coat, and the other, 13 %0a%0aI Generally identified with the Antirrhinum Orontium of Linnaeus, %0aSmall toad-flax, Calf’s snout, or Lesser wild snapdragon. Desfontaines %0amentions the Antirrhinum purpureum, and Littre the A. majus of Lin¬ %0anaeus, the Common snapdragon, or Greater calf’s snout. %0a%0a8 “Wild lychnis.” %0a%0a9 Theophrastus says, B. ix. c. 21, speaking of the last-mentioned plant, %0a“ The same too, with reference to glory and consideration.” Pliny, %0asingularly enough, has mistaken the Greek word “eucleia” (glory) for %0athe name of a plant, and has fabricated one accordingly: a similar blunder %0ato that made by him with reference to “ hippace,” in c. 44 of this Book. %0a%0a10 See c. 36 of this Book. %0a%0aII Fee is inclined to identify it with the Bulbine of B. xx. c. 41, pro¬ %0abably the Hyacinthus botryoi'des of Linnaeus, the Blue grape hyacinth. %0aBrotero and Desfontaines name the Hyacinthus comosus, the Purple grape %0ahyacinth. Littre mentions the Ornithogalum nutans of Linnaeus, the May %0astar of Bethlehem. %0a%0a12 Identified by Fee with the Bulbus vomitorius or Bulb emetic of B. xx. %0a%0a%0a132 %0a%0a%0apliny’s natural history. %0a%0a%0a[Book XXV. %0a%0a%0asimilar in appearance to the black poppy, and possessed of %0agreater virtues than the first. They are both, however, of a %0awarming nature, for which reason they are administered to %0apersons who have taken hemlock, a poison for which frankin¬ %0acense and panaces are used, chironion 15 in particular. This %0alast, too, is given in cases of poisoning by fungi. %0a%0aCHAP. 83. (11.)- REMEDIES FOR DISEASES OF THE HEAD. %0a%0aNTMPHiEA HERACLIA : TWO REMEDIES. %0a%0aBut we shall now proceed to point out the various classes %0aof remedies for the several parts of the body, and the maladies %0ato which those parts are subject, beginning in the first place %0awith the head. %0a%0aThe root of nymphsea heraclia 14 effects the cure of alopecy, %0aif they are beaten up together, 15 and applied. The polythrix 4 %0adiffers from the callitrichos 17 in having white, rushlike suckers, %0alarger leaves, and more numerous; the main stem, 18 too, is %0alarger. This plant strengthens the hair, prevents it from %0afalling off, and makes it grow more thickly. %0a%0aCHAP. 84. -THE LINGULACA : ONE REMEDY. %0a%0aThe same is the case too with the lingulaca, 19 a plant that %0agrows in the vicinity of springs, and the root of which is %0areduced to ashes, and beaten up with hog’s lard. Due care %0amust be taken, however, that it is the lard of a female, of a %0ablack colour, and one that has never farrowed. The application %0ais rendered additionally efficacious, if the ointment is applied in %0athe sun. Boot, too, of cyclaminos is employed in the same %0a%0ac. 41, the same, in his opinion, with the Narcissus jonquilla, the Emetic jon¬ %0aquil. Sprengel, however, would identify the Bulbus vomitorius with either %0athe Narcissus orientalis or the Pancratium Illyricum; and Sibthorp con¬ %0asiders its synonym to be the Ornithogalum stachyoides of Aiton. Littre %0agives the Muscari comosum. %0a%0a13 See c. 13 of this Book. %0a%0a14 See c. 37 of this Book, and B. xxvi. c. 28. %0a%0a15 There seems to be an hiatus here. From the words of Dioscorides, %0aB. iii. c. 138, it would appear that pitch was the other ingredient, to be %0abeaten up with the plant. %0a%0a16 The same as the Polytrichos of B. xxii. c. 30. %0a%0a17 In B. xxii. c. 30, he makes them to be the same plant, and it is moft %0a%0aprobable that they may be both referred to the Asplenium trichomanes of %0aLinnaeus. 18 “ Frutice.” %0a%0a■ 19 See B. xxiv. c. 108. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 87.] %0a%0a%0aHYSSOP. %0a%0a%0a133 %0a%0a%0amanner for a similar purpose. A decoction of root of helle¬ %0abore in oil or in water is used for the removal of porrigo. For %0athe cure of head-ache, root of all kinds of panaces 20 is used, %0abeaten up in oil; as also aristolochia 21 and iberis, 22 this last being %0aapplied to the head for an hour or more, if the patient can %0abear it bo long, care being taken to bathe in the meanwhile. %0aThe daucus, too, is curative of head-ache. Cyclaminos, 23 intro¬ %0aduced into the nostrils with honey, clears the head; used in %0athe form of a liniment, it heals ulcers of the head. Periste- %0areos, 21 also, is curative of diseases of the head. %0a%0aCHAP. 85. -THE CACALIA OR LEONTICK : THREE REMEDIES. %0a%0aThe name of “ cacalia” 25 or “ leontice” is given to a plant %0awith seed resembling small pearls in appearance, and hang¬ %0aing down between large leaves: it is mostly found upon %0amountains. Fifteen grains of this seed are macerated in oil, %0aand the head is rubbed with the mixture, the contrary way to %0athe hair. %0a%0a%0aCHAP. 86.-THE CALL1TRICH0S '. ONE REMEDY. %0a%0aA sternutatory, too, is prepared from the callitrichos. 25 The %0aleaves of this plant are similar to those of the lentil, and the %0astems resemble fine rushes ; the root is very diminutive. It %0agrows in 6hady, moist localities, and has a burning taste in the %0amouth. %0a%0aCHAP. 87. -HYSSOP : TEN REMEDIES. %0a%0aHyssop, 27 beaten up in oil, is curative of phthiriasis and %0a%0a*° See c. II of this Book. %0a%0a21 See c. 54 of this Book. 22 See c. 49 of this Book. %0a%0a23 See e. 67 of this Book. 21 Or Vervain. %0a%0a25 Sprengel identified this plant at first with the Buplevrum longifolium %0aof Linnaeus, the Long-leaved hare’s ear, but at a later period with the %0aMercurialis tomentosa, the Woolly mercury. Fee .suggests the Cacalia %0apetasites or albifrons, though with diffidence. Littre gives the Cacalia ver- %0aDascifolia of Sibthorp. %0a%0a26 See c. 83 of this Book ; also B. xxii. c. 30, and B. xxvii. c. 111. %0a%0a27 There has been much discussion on the identification of the Hyssopum %0aof the ancients, their descriptions varying very considerably. It has been %0asuggested that that of the Egyptians was the Origanum JBgyptianum; that %0aof the Hebrews, the Origanum Syriacum ; that of Dioscorides, the Origa¬ %0anum Smyrnamm; and that of the other Greek writers, the Teucrium pseudo- %0ahyssopus, or else the Thymbra verticillata and spicata. Fee is inclined to %0aidentify that here mentioned by Pliny with the Thymbra spicata of Lin¬ %0anaeus, and the Garden hyssop of Dioscorides, with the Hyssopus officinalis %0a%0a%0a134 %0a%0a%0aflint’s natubal, histoby. %0a%0a%0a[Book XXV. %0a%0a%0aprurigo of the head. The be3t hyssop is that of Mount %0aTaurus in Cilicia, next to which in quality is the produce of %0aPamphylia and Smyrna. This plant is injurious to the %0astomach: taken with figs, it produces alvine evacuations, and %0aused in combination with honey, it acts as an emetic. It is %0agenerally thought that, beaten up with honey, salt, and cum¬ %0amin, it is curative of the stings of serpents. %0a%0aCHAP. 88.-THE LONCHITIS : FOUK REMEDIES. %0a%0aThe lonchitis 29 is not, as most writers have imagined, the %0asame plant as the xiphion 30 or phasganion, although the seed %0aof it does bear a resemblance to the point of a spear. The %0alonchitis, in fact, has leaves like those of the leek, of a red¬ %0adish colour near the root, and more numerous there than on the %0aupper part of the stem. It bears diminutive heads, which are %0avery similar to our masks of comedy, and from which a small %0atongue protrudes : 31 the roots of it are remarkably long. It %0agrows in thirsty, arid soils. %0a%0aCHAP. 89. -THE XIPHION OB PHASGANION: FOUR BEMEDIES. %0a%0aThe xiphion 32 or phasganion, on the other hand, is found %0agrowing in humid localities. On first leaving the ground it %0ahas the appearance of a sword ; the stem of it is two cubits in %0alength, and the root is fringed like a hazel nut. 33 %0a%0aThis root should always be taken up before harvest, and %0adried in the shade. The upper part of it, pounded with %0afrankincense, and mixed with an equal quantity of wine, ex¬ %0atracts fractured bones of the cranium, purulent matter in all %0aparts of the body, and bones of serpents, 34 when accidentally %0a%0aof Linnaeus. Littre states, however, that this last is a stranger to Greece, %0aand that M. Fraas ( Synopsis , p. 182) identifies the hyssop of Dioscorides %0awith the Origanum Smyrnaeum or Syriaeum. %0a%0a29 Generally identified with the Serapias lingua of Linnaeus. %0a%0a30 The same, most probably, as the Gladiolus of B. xxi. c. 67. See also %0athe next Chapter in this Book. %0a%0a31 This was a characteristic feature of the masks used in the Roman %0aComedy. %0a%0a32 See Note 30 above. The medicinal properties here attributed to the %0aXiphion, or Gladiolus communis, our common Red corn-flag, are very doubt¬ %0aful, as Fee remarks. %0a%0a33 With the outer coat on, of course. %0a%0a31 Dalechamps is probably right in preferring the reading “carpentis” %0ato “ serpentis,” in which case the meaning would be, “ or bones when %0aaccidentally crushed by the wheels of vehicles.” %0a%0a%0aChap. 90.] %0a%0a%0aPSYLLIOX. %0a%0a%0a135 %0a%0a%0atrodden upon ; it is very efficacious, too, for poisons. In cases %0aof head-ache, the head should be rubbed with hellebore, boiled %0aand beaten up in olive oil, or oil of roses, or else with peuce- %0adanum steeped in olive oil or rose oil, and vinegar. This last %0aplant, made lukewarm, is very good also for hemicrania 35 and %0avertigo. It being of a heating nature, the body is rubbed with %0athe root as a sudorific. %0a%0aCHAP. 90. —P8YLLION, CYNOIDES, CBYSTALLION, SICELICON, OR %0a%0acynomyia; sixteen remedies, thryselinttm : one remedy. %0a%0aPsyllion, 36 cynoides, crvstallion, sicelicon, or cynomyia, has %0aa slender root, of which no use is made, and numerous thin %0abranches, with seeds resembling those of the bean, at the ex¬ %0atremities. 37 The leaves of it are not unlike a dog’s head in' %0ashape ; 38 and the seed, which is enclosed in berries, bears a %0aresemblance to a flea—whence its name “ psyllion.” This plant %0ais generally found growing in vineyards, is of a cooling nature, %0aand is extremely efficacious as a dispellent. The seed of it is %0athe part made use of; for head-ache, it is applied to the fore¬ %0ahead and temples with rose oil and vinegar, or else with %0aoxycrate; it is used as a liniment for other purposes also. %0aMixed in the proportion of one acetabulum to one sextarius of %0awater, it is left to coagulate and thicken; after which it is %0abeaten up, and the thick solution is used as a liniment for all %0akinds of pains, abscesses, and inflammations. %0a%0aAristolochia is used as a remedy for wounds in the head; it %0ahas the property, too, of extracting fractured bones, not only %0afrom other parts of the body, but the cranium in particular-. %0aThe same, too, with plistolochia. %0a%0aThryselinum 39 is a plant not unlike parsley; the root of it, %0aeaten, carries off pituitous humours from the head. %0a%0a34 Or “ meagrim.” %0a%0a36 Identified with the Plantago Psyllium of Linnaeus, our Fleawort, %0aFleaseed, or Fleabane. %0a%0a37 Nothing, Fee says, can be more absurd than this description of the %0a%0aplant. , %0a%0a38 Whence its name “ cynoides ” and “ cynomyia.” %0a%0a59 This plant has not been identified; Wild’ water-parsley, perhaps a kind %0aof Sium, has been suggested. %0a%0a%0a136 %0a%0a%0apliny’s natural history. %0a%0a%0a[Book XXV. %0a%0a%0aCHAP. 91 . ( 12 .) -REMEDIES FOR DISEASES OF THE ETES. %0a%0aIt is generally thought that the greater centaury 40 strengthens %0athe sight, if the eyes are fomented with it steeped in water; %0aand that by employing the juice of the smaller kind, in com. %0abination with honey, films and cloudiness may he dispersed, %0amarks obliterated, and small flies removed which have got %0ainto the eye. It is thought also that sideritis is curative of %0aalbugo in beasts of burden. As to chelidonia , 41 it is marvel¬ %0alously good for all the affections above mentioned. Root of %0apanaces 42 is applied, with polenta , 43 to defluxions of the eyes; %0aand for the purpose of keeping them down, henbane-seed is %0ataken, in doses of one obolus, with an equal proportion of %0aopium, in wine. Juice, too, of gentian is used as a lini¬ %0ament, and it sometimes forms an ingredient in the more ac¬ %0ative eyesalves , 44 as a substitute for meconium.

These plants do not exceed a %0apalm in height, and have a tender stem, with diminutive %0aleaves of a rounded form, drooping upon the ground. They %0agrow in gardens and in spots covered with water, the blue %0aanagallis being the first to blossom. The juice 54 of either %0aplant, applied with honey, disperses films upon the eyes, %0asuffusions of blood 55 in those organs resulting from blows, and %0aargema 56 with a red tinge: if used in combination with Attic %0ahoney, they are still more efficacious. The anagallis has the %0aeffect also of dilating 57 the pupil; hence the eye is anointed %0awith it before the operation of couching 58 for cataract. These %0aplants are employed also for diseases of the eyes in beasts of %0aburden. %0a%0aThe juice, injected into the nostrils, which are then rinsed %0awith wine, acts as a detergent upon the head : it is taken also, %0ain doses of one drachma, in wine, for wounds inflicted by ser¬ %0apents. It is a remarkable fact, that cattle will refuse to touch %0athe female plant; but if it should so happen that, deceived by %0athe resemblance—the flower being the only distinguishing %0amark—they have accidentally tasted it, they immediately have %0arecourse, as a remedy, to the plant called “ asyla,” 59 but more %0agenerally known among us as “ ferus oculus .” 60 Some persons %0arecommend those who gather it, to prelude by saluting it %0abefore sunrise, and then, before uttering another word, to take %0acare and extract the juice immediately; if this is done, they %0asay, it will be doubly efficacious. %0a%0aAs to the juice of euphorbia, we have spoken 61 of its pro¬ %0aperties at sufficient length already.

The seed is %0apounded for the purpose, and applied with meal; or else the %0ajuice is extracted from the stem and more pulpy leaves, the %0aears being first removed. This juice is incorporated with meal %0aof three-month wheat, and divided into lozenges. %0a%0aCHAP. 94 . —MANDRAGORA, CIRC.EON, MORION, OR HIPPOPHLOMOSJ %0aTWO VARIETIES OF IT : TWENTY-FOUR REMEDIES. %0a%0aSome persons, too, were in the habit of employing mandra- %0agora for diseases of the eyes; but more recently, the use of it %0afor such a purpose has been abandoned. It is a well-ascertained %0afact, however, that the root, beaten up with rose oil and %0awine, is curative of defluxions of the eyes and pains in those %0aorgans; and, indeed, the juice of this plant still forms an in¬ %0agredient in many medicaments for the eyes. Some persons %0agive it the name of “ circaeon .” 63 There are two varieties, %0athe white 64 mandragora, which is generally thought to be the %0amale plant, and the black , 65 which is considered to be the %0afemale. It has a leaf narrower than that of the lettuce, a %0ahairy stem, and a double or triple root, black without and %0awhite within, soft and fleshy, and nearly a cubit in length. %0a%0aBoth kinds bear a fruit about the size of a hazel-nut, %0aenclosing a seed resembling the pips of a pear in appearance. %0aThe name given to the white plant by some persons is %0a“arsen ,” 66 by others “morion ,” 67 and by others again, “hippo- %0aphlomos.” The leaves of it are white, while those of the other %0a%0a62 See B. xviii. c. 44, and B. xxi. c. 63. %0a%0a63 Or “ Plant of Circe.” %0a%0a64 Identified by Fee with the Atropa mandragora vemalis of Bertolini, %0athe Spring mandrake. %0a%0a65 The Atropa mandragora autumnalis of Bertolini, the Autumnal man¬ %0adrake. 66 The Greek for “ male.” %0a%0a67 “Dementing.” Fee remarks that the “Morion” in reality is a %0adifferent plant, and queries whether it may not be the Atropa bella¬ %0adonna of Linnaeus, the Belladonna, or Deadly nightshade, mentioned above %0ain Note 57. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 04.] %0a%0a%0aMAXDBAGOItA. %0a%0a%0a139 %0a%0a%0aone 68 are broader, and similar to those of garden lapathum 69 in %0aAppearance. Persons, when about to gather this plant, take %0afevery precaution not to have the wind blowing in their face ; %0aand, after tracing three circles round it with a sword, turn %0atowards the west and dig it up . 10 The juice is extracted both %0afrom the fruit and from the stalk, the top being first removed; %0aalso from the root, which is punctured for the purpose, or else %0aa decoction is made of it. The filaments, too, of the root are %0amade use of, and it is sometimes cut up into segments and %0akept in wine. • %0a%0aIt is not the mandragora of every country that will yield a %0ajuice, but where it does, it is about vintage time that it is %0acollected : it has in all cases a powerful odour, that of the %0aroot and fruit the most so. The fruit is gathered when ripe, %0aand dried in the shade; and the juice, when extracted, is left %0ato thicken in the sun. The same is the case, too, with the %0ajuice of the root, which is extracted either by pounding it or %0aby boiling it down to one third in red wine. The leaves %0aare best, kept in brine ; indeed, when fresh, the juice of them %0ais a baneful poison ,' 1 and these noxious properties are far from %0abeing entirely removed, even when they are preserved in %0abrine. The very odour of them is highly oppressive to the %0ahead, although there are countries in which the fruit is eaten. %0aPersons ignorant of its properties are apt to be struck dumb %0aby the odour of this plant when in excess, and too strong a %0adose of the juice is productive of fatal effects. %0a%0aAdministered in doses proportioned to the strength of the %0apatient, this juice has a narcotic effect; a middling dose being %0aone cyathus. It is given, too, for injuries inflicted by serpents, %0aand before incisions or punctures are made in the body, in %0a%0a68 The female, or black, mandrake. %0a%0a69 See B. xx. c. 85. . %0a%0a70 The superstitions with reference to the Mandrake extended from the %0aearliest times till a very recent period. It was used in philtres, and was %0asupposed to utter piercing cries when taken up ; Josephus counsels those %0awhose business it is to do so, to employ a dog for the purpose, if they would %0aavoid dreadful misfortunes. All these notions probably arose from the re¬ %0asemblance which the root bears to the legs and lower part of the human %0abody. See B. xxii. c. 9, where we have queried in a Note whether the %0aEryngium may not have been the “ mandrake,” the possession of which %0awas so much coveted by the wives of Jacob. %0a%0a71 “ Pestis est.” %0a%0a%0a140 %0a%0a%0aplikt’s natural history. %0a%0a%0a[BooUXY. %0a%0a%0aorder to ensure insensibility to the pain .' 2 Indeed, for this last %0apurpose, with some persons, the odour of it is quite sufficient %0ato induce sleep. The juice is taken also as a substitute for %0ahellebore, in doses of two obeli, in honied wine: hellebore, %0ahowever, is more efficacious as an emetic, and as an evacuant %0aof black bile. %0a%0aCHAP. 95.- HEMLOCK 1 THIRTEEN REMEDIES. %0a%0aHemlock , 73 too, is a poisonous plant, rendered odious by the %0ause made of it by the Athenian people, as an instrument of %0acapital punishment: still , 71 however, as it is employed for %0amany useful purposes, it must not be omitted. It is the seed %0athat is noxious, the stalk being eaten by many people, either %0agreen, or cooked 75 in the saucepan. This stem is smooth, %0ajointed like a reed, of a swarthy hue, often as much as two %0acubits in height, and branchy at the top. The leaves are like %0athose of coriander, only softer, and possessed of a powerful %0aodour. The seed is more substantial than that of anise, and %0athe root is hollow and never used. The seed and leaves are %0apossessed of refrigerating properties; indeed, it is owing to %0athese properties that it is so fatal, the cold chills with which it %0ais attended commencing at the extremities. The great remedy 1 %0afor it, provided it has not reached the vitals, is wine, which is %0anaturally of a warming tendency ; but if it is taken in wine, %0ait is irremediably fatal. %0a%0aA juice is extracted from the leaves and flowers; for it is %0aat the time of its blossoming that it is in its full vigour. The %0aseed is crushed, and the juice extracted from it is left to %0athicken in the sun, and then divided into lozenges. This %0a%0a72 In the same way that chloroform is now administered. %0a%0a73 “ Cicuta.” Identified with the Conium maculatum of Linnaeus, %0aCommon hemlock or Keghs. It grows in the vicinity of Athens, and pro¬ %0abably formed the basis of the poisons with which that volatile people “re¬ %0acompensed,” as Fee remarks, the virtues and exploits of their philosophers %0aand generals. Socrates, Phocion, and Philopoemen, are said to have been %0apoisoned with hemlock ; but in the case of Socrates, it was probably com¬ %0abined with opium and other narcotics. See B. xiv. cc. 7, 28, and B. xxiii. %0ac. 23. %0a%0a71 He has more than once stated, that it is not his object to enter into %0aa description of poisons. %0a%0a74 Fee doubts if it is possible to eat it, boiled even, with impunity. %0a%0a76 See B. xiv. cc. 7, 28, and B. xxiii. c. 23. %0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 97 ] %0a%0a%0aMOLYBDiENA. %0a%0a%0a141 %0a%0a%0apreparation proves fatal by coagulating the blood—another %0adeadly property which belongs to it; and hence it is that the %0abodies of those who have been poisoned by it are covered with %0a8pots. It is sometimes used in combination with water as a me¬ %0adium for diluting certain medicaments. An emollient poultice %0ais also prepared from this juice, for the purpose of cooling the %0astomach ; but the principal use made of it is as a topical ap¬ %0aplication, to check defluxions of the eyes in summer, and to %0aallay pains in those organs. It is employed also as an ingre¬ %0adient in eyesalves, and is used for arresting fluxes in other parts %0aof the body: the leaves, too, have a soothing effect upon all %0akinds of pains and tumours, and upon defluxions of the eyes. %0a%0aAnaxilaiis makes a statement to the effect, that if the %0amamillae 77 are rubbed with hemlock during virginity, they will %0aalways be hard and firm : but a better-ascertained fact is, that %0aapplied 78 to the mamillae, it dries up the milk in women re¬ %0acently delivered; as also that, applied to the testes at the age %0aof puberty, it acts most effectually as an antaphrodisiac. 79 As %0ato those cases in which it is recommended to take it internally %0aas a remedy, I shall, for my own part, decline to mention them. %0aThe most powerful hemlock is that grown at Susa, in Parthia, %0athe next best being the produce of Laconia, Crete, and Asia. 80 %0aIn Greece, the hemlock of the finest quality is that of Megara, %0aand next to it, that of Attica. %0a%0aCHAP. 96 . -CRETHMOS AGRIOS : ONE REMEDY. %0a%0aCrethmos agrios, 81 applied to the eyes, removes rheum; and, %0awith the addition of polenta, it causes tumours to disappear. %0a%0achap. 97 . —molybd^ena: one remedy. %0a%0aMolybdoena 82 also grows everywhere in the fields, a plant %0acommonly known as “ plumbago.” 82 It has leaves like those of %0alapathum, 83 and a thick, hairy root.

It is used in a %0agreen state, and the juice of it disperses films upon the eyes; %0ahence it is that it is employed as an ingredient in medicinal %0acompositions for the eyes. %0a%0aCHAP. 99 .- THE ARBORESCENT CAPNOS: THREE REMEDIE8. %0a%0aThere is another kind 87 of capnos also, similar both in name %0aand properties, but different in appearance. It is a branchy %0aplant, is extremely delicate, has leaves like those of coriander, %0ais of an ashy colour, and bears a purple flower: it grows in %0agardens, and amid crops of barley. Employed in the form of %0aan ointment for the eyes, it improves the sight, producing %0atears in the same way that smoke does, to which, in fact, it %0aowes its name. It has the effect also of preventing the eye¬ %0alashes, when pulled out, from growing again. %0a%0aCHAP. 100. -THE ACORON OR AGRION : FOURTEEN REMEDIES. %0a%0aThe acoron 88 has leaves similar to those of the iris, 69 only %0anarrower, and with a longer stalk; the roots of it are black, %0aand not so veined, but in other respects are similar to those of %0athe iris, have an acrid taste and a not unpleasant smell, and %0aact as a carminative.

They are cut %0ainto pieces about a finger in length, and dried in leather bags" %0ain the shade. %0a%0aThere are some authors who give the name of “ acoron” to %0athe root of the oxymyrsine ; 91 for which reason also some prefer %0agiving that plant the name of “ acorion.” It has powerful pro¬ %0aperties as a calorific and resolvent, and is taken in drink for %0acataract and films upon the eyes; the juice also is extracted, %0aand taken for injuries inflicted by serpents. %0a%0aCHAP. 101 . -THE COTYLEDON : TWO VABIETIES OF IT : SIXTY-ONE %0a%0aEEMEDIES. %0a%0aThe cotyledon 92 is a small herbaceous plant, with a diminu¬ %0ative, tender stem, and an unctuous leaf, with a concave surface %0alike that of the cotyloid cavity of the thigh. It grows in %0amaritime and rocky localities, is of a green colour, and has a %0arounded root like an olive: the juice of it is remedial for %0adiseases of the eyes. %0a%0aThere is another 93 kind also of the same plant, the leaves of %0awhich are of a dirty green 91 colour, larger than those of the %0aother, and growing in greater numbers about the root, which %0ais surrounded with them just as the eye is with the socket. %0aThese leaves have a remarkably astringent taste, and the stem %0ais of considerable length, but extremely slender.

Other names given to it are “ chryso- %0athales” 99 and “ isoetes i” 1 but aizoiim is the common appellation %0aof them both, from their being always green. %0a%0aThe larger kind exceeds a cubit in height, and is somewhat %0athicker than the thumb : at the extremity, the leaves are simi¬ %0alar to a tongue in shape, and are fleshy, unctuous, full of juice, %0aand about as broad as a person’s thumb.

All these %0aplants have the same properties, being cooling and astringent. %0aThe leaves, applied topically, or the juice, in form of a lini¬ %0ament, are curative of defluxions of the eyes: this juice too %0aacts as a detergent upon ulcers of the eyes, makes new flesh, %0aand causes them to cicatrize; it 3 cleanses the eyelids also of %0aviscous matter. Applied to the temples, both the leaves %0aand the juice of these plants are remedial for head-ache ; they %0aneutralize the venom also of the phalangium ; and the greater %0aaizoiim, in particular, is an antidote to aconite. It is asserted, %0atoo, that those who carry this last plant about them will never %0abe stung by the scorpion. %0a%0aThese plants are curative of pains in the ears; which %0ais the case also with juice of henbane, applied in moderate %0aquantities, of achillea, 4 of the smaller centaury and plantago, %0aofpeucedanum in combination with rose-oil and opium, and of %0aacoron 6 mixed, with rose-leaves.

The %0asame is the case, also, with root of cinquefoil, boiled down to %0aone third, iu wiue or vinegar; before it is boiled, however, the %0aroot should be washed in sea or salt water : the decoction, too, %0amust be kept a considerable time in the mouth. Some persons %0aprefer cleaning the teeth with ashes of cinquefoil. %0a%0aRoot of verbascum 13 is also boiled in wine, and the decoction %0aused for rinsing the teeth. The same is done too with hyssop %0aand juice of peucedanum, mixed with opium ; or else the juice %0aof the root of anagallis, 14 the female plant in particular, is %0ainjected into the nostril on the opposite side to that in which %0athe pain is felt. %0a%0aCHAP. 106 .- ER1GERON, PAPPUS, ACANTHIS, OR SENECIO : EIGHT %0a%0aREMEDIES. %0a%0aErigeron 15 is called by our people “ senecio.” It is said %0athat if a person, after tracing around this plant with an imple¬ %0ament of iron, takes it up and touches the tooth affected with it %0athree times, taking care to spit each time on the ground, and %0athen replaces it in the same spot, so as to take root again, %0ahe will never experience any further pain in that tooth. This %0aplant has just the appearance and softness of trixago, 16 with a %0anumber of small reddish-coloured stems: it is found growing %0aupon walls, and the tiled roofs of houses. The Greeks have %0a%0a11 See c. 11 of this Book. >2 See c. 28 of this Book. %0a%0a13 See c. 73 of this Book. 14 See c. 92 of this Book. %0a%0a15 Identified by Desfontaines with the Senecio Jacobsen of Linnsns, %0aCommon ragwort. Fee identifies it with the Senecio vulgaris of Linmeui, %0aour Groundsel. They are both destitute of medicinal properties. %0a%0a16 See B. xxiv. c. 80. %0a%0a%0aChap. 107.] %0a%0a%0aTHE El'HEMEEOK. %0a%0a%0aHz- %0a%0a%0agiven it the name of “ erigeron,” 17 because it is white in %0aspring. The head is divided into numerous downy filaments, %0awhich resemble those of the thorn, 18 protruding from between %0athe divisions of the head: hence it is that Callimachus has %0agiven it the name of “ acanthis,” 19 while others, again, call it %0a“ pappus. 20 ” %0a%0aAfter all, however, the Greek writers are by no means agreed %0aas to this plant; some say, for instance, that it has leaves %0alike those of rocket, while others maintain that they resemble %0athose of the robur, only that they are considerably smaller. %0aSome, again, assert that the root is useless, while others aver %0athat it is beneficial for the sinews, and others that it produces %0asuffocation, if taken in drink. On the other hand, some have %0aprescribed it in wine, for jaundice and all affections of the %0abladder, heart, and liver, and give it as their opinion that it %0acarries off gravel from the kidneys. It has been prescribed, %0aalso, by them for sciatica, the patient taking one drachma %0ain oxymel, after a walk; and has been recommended as ex¬ %0atremely useful for griping pains in the bowels, taken in raisin %0awine. They assert, also, that used as an aliment with vinegar, %0ait is wholesome for the thoracic organs, and recommend it to %0abe grown in the garden for these several purposes. %0a%0aIn addition to this, there are some authorities to be found, %0awhich distinguish another variety of this plant, but without %0amentioning its peculiar characteristics. This last they recom¬ %0amend to be taken in water, to neutralize the venom of serpents, %0aand prescribe it to be eaten for the cure of epilepsy. For my %0aown part, however, I shall only speak of it in accordance with %0athe uses made of it among us Romans, uses based upon the %0aresults of actual experience. The down of this plant, beaten %0aup with saffron and a little cold water, is applied to defluxions %0aof the eyes; parched with a little salt, it is employed for the %0acure of scrofulous sores. %0a%0aCHAP. 107 . —THE EPHEMERON : TWO REMEDIES. %0a%0aThe ephemeron 21 has leaves like those of the lily, but smaller; %0a%0a11 “Eapi yipiov, “aged,” or “hoary in spring.” „ %0a%0a19 “ Spinae.” He probably uses a wrong term, and means “ thistle.” %0a%0a19 It may possibly have been so called from the Acanthis, or goldfinch, %0athat bird being fond of groundsel. %0a%0a20 “Thistle-down.” If Pliny is speaking of groundsel, he is wrong in %0ahis assertion that it turns white, or in other words, goes to seed, in spring. %0a%0a21 Sprengel identifies it with the Ornithogalum stachyoides; but that %0a%0a%0a148 %0a%0a%0apliny’s natural history. %0a%0a%0a[Book XXY. %0a%0a%0aa stem of the same height, a blue flower, and a seed of which %0ano use is made. The root is single, about the thickness of %0aone’s finger, and an excellent remedy for diseases of the teeth; %0afor which purpose it is cut up in pieces, and boiled iu vinegar, %0athe decoction being used warm as a collutory. The root, too, %0ais employed by itself to strengthen the teeth, being inserted for %0athe purpose in those that are hollow or carious. %0a%0aRoot of chelidonia 22 is also beaten up with vinegar, and kept in %0athe mouth. Black hellebore is sometimes inserted in carious %0ateeth ; and a decoction of either of these last-mentioned plants, %0ain vinegar, has the effect of strengthening loose teeth. %0a%0aCHAP. 108 . -THE LABRUM VENEREUM : ONE REMEDY. %0a%0aLabrum Venereum 23 is the name given to a plant that grows %0ain running streams. 24 It produces a small worm, 25 which is %0acrushed by being rubbed upon the teeth, or else enclosed in %0awax and inserted in the hollow of the tooth. Care must be %0ataken, however, that the plant, when pulled up, does not touch %0athe ground. %0a%0aCHAP. 109 . -THE BATRACHION, RANUNCULUS, OR STllUfiUS J FOUR %0a%0aVARIETIES OF IT : FOURTEEN REMEDIES. %0a%0aThe plant known to the Greeks as “ batrachion,” 26 we call %0aranunculus. 27 There are four varieties of it, 28 one of which %0a%0ahas no blue flower, and the same is the case with many other plants that %0ahave been suggested as its synonym. Fee suggests the Convallaria verti- %0acillata of Linnaeus, the whorl-leaved Solomon’s seal; as to which, however, %0athere is the same difficulty in reference to the flower. Holland calls it the %0a“May lily,” otherwise the Lily of the valley, the Convallaria Maialis; %0aand this is the synonym suggested by Fuchsius. Littre gives the Conval¬ %0alaria multiflora of Linnaeus. 22 See c. 50 of this Book. %0a%0a23 Or “Venus’ bath.” Identified by Littre with the Dipsacus silvestris %0aof Linnaeus, and by Fee with the Dipsacus fullonum of Linnaeus, the %0aTeazel, or Fuller’s thistle. It received its Roman name from the form of %0athe leaves, which are channelled, and curved at the edo-es. %0a%0a24 This is entirely erroneous ; he may possibly have°mistranslated some %0aauthor, who has stated that the rain-water settles in reservoirs formed by %0athe leaves. %0a%0a25 He alludes to the larvae of the Curculio or weevil, which are found %0a%0ain the head of the Dipsacus, and many other plants. See B. xxvii. c. 62, %0aand B. xxx. c. 8. 26 “ Frog-plant.” %0a%0a27 “ Little frog.” Called “Crow r -foot” by us. %0a%0a23 Sprengel identifies it with the Ranunculus Seguicri, Fee with the R. %0aAsiaticus, also a native of Greece. %0a%0a%0aChap. 109.] %0a%0a%0aTHE EATKACHION. %0a%0a%0a149 %0a%0a%0alias leaves somewhat thicker than those of coriander, nearly the %0asize of those of the mallow, and of a livid hue: the stem of %0athe plant is long and slender, and the root white ; it grows on %0amoist and well-shaded embankments. The second 29 kind is %0amore foliated than the preceding one, the leaves have more %0anumerous incisions, and the stems of the plant are long. The %0athird 30 variety is smaller than the others, has a powerful smell, %0aand a flower of a golden colour. The fourth 31 kind is very like %0athe one last mentioned, but the flower is milk-white. %0a%0aAll these plants have caustic properties: if the leaves are %0aapplied unboiled, they raise blisters like those caused by the %0aaction of fire ; hence it is that they are used for the removal of %0aleprous spots, itch-scabs, and brand marks upon the skin. %0aThey form an ingredient also in all caustic preparations, and %0aare applied for the cure of alopccy, care being taken to remove %0athem very speedily. The root, if chewed for some time, in %0acases of tooth-ache, will cause 33 the teeth to break; dried and %0apulverized, it acts as a sternutatory. %0a%0aOur herbalists give this plant the name of “ strumus,” from %0athe circumstance of its being curative of strumous 33 sores and %0ainflamed tumours, for which purpose a portion of it is hung %0aup in the smoke. It is a general belief, too, with them, that if %0ait is replanted, the malady so cured will reappear 34 —a criminal %0apractice, for which the plantago is also employed. The juice %0aof this last-mentioned plant is curative of internal ulcerations %0aof the mouth; and the leaves and root are chewed for a similar %0a%0a25 Identified by Dcsfontaines with the Ranunculus hirsutus, or philonotis. %0aFile, with Hardouin, considers it to be the same as the Apiastrum of B. %0axx. c. 45, and identifies it with the Ranunculus Sardoiis of Crantz, the %0aplant probably which produces a contraction of the mouth, rendered famous %0aas the “ Sardonic grin,” and more commonly known as the Ranunculus %0asceleratus, Apiuui risus, or Apium Sardoiim, “Laughing parsley,’ or %0a“Sardinian parsley.' %0a%0a30 Identified by Sprengel and Dcsfontaines with the Ranunculus repens, %0aor Creeping crow-foot; but by Fee, with the Ranunculus muricatus of %0aLinnaeus. %0a%0a31 Identified by Desfontaines with the Ranunculus aconitifolius; by Fee %0awith the Ranunculus aquatilis of Linnaeus, the Water crowfoot. I he %0aRanunculi are all active poisons. %0a%0a32 A fabulous assertion, probably, and it is very doubtful if any one ever %0amade the trial of its efficacy. %0a%0a33 Or scrofula. 31 S.:e B. xxi c. 83, and B. xxvi. c. 5. %0a%0a%0a150 %0a%0a%0apliny’s natural history. %0a%0a%0a1 %0a%0a%0a[Book XXV. %0a%0a%0apurpose, even when the mouth is suffering from defluxious. %0aCinquefoil effects the cure of ulcerations and offensive breath; %0apsyllium 35 is used also for ulcers of tlie mouth. %0a%0aCHAP. 110 . —REMEDIAL PREPARATIONS FOR OFFENSIVE DUEAIU : %0a%0aTWO KINDS OF THEM. %0a%0aWe shall also here make mention of certain preparations for %0athe cure of offensive breath—a most noisome inconvenience. %0aFor this purpose, leaves of myrtle and lentisk are taken in equal %0aproportions, with one half the quantity of Syrian nut-galls; %0athey are then pounded together and sprinkled with old wine, %0aand the composition is chewed in the morning. In similar %0acases, also, ivy berries are used, in combination with cassia and %0amyrrh; these ingredients being mixed, in equal proportions, %0awith wine. %0a%0aFor offensive odours of the nostrils, even though attended %0awith carcinoma, the most effectual remedy is seed of dra- %0acontium 38 beaten up with honey.

(1.)-WHEN THE WILD PLANTS WERE FIRST BROUGHT %0a%3c %0a%3c INTO USE. %0a%3c %0a%3c The more highly esteemed plants of which I am now about %0a%3c to speak, and which are produced by the earth for medicinal %0a%3c purposes solely, inspire me with admiration of the industry %0a%3c and laborious research displayed by the ancients. Indeed there %0a%3c is nothing that they have not tested by experiment or left %0a%3c untried; no discovery of theirs which they have not disclosed, %0a%3c or which they have not been desirous to leave for the benefit %0a%3c of posterity. We, on the contrary, at the present day, make %0a%3c it our object to conceal and suppress the results of our labours, %0a%3c and to defraud our fellow-men of blessings even which have %0a%3c been purchased by others. For true it is, beyond all doubt, %0a%3c that those who have gained any trifling accession of knowledge, %0a%3c keep it to themselves, and envy the enjoyment of it by others; to %0a%3c leave mankind uninstructed being looked upon as the high prero¬ %0a%3c gative of learning. So far is it from being the habit with them %0a%3c to enter upon new fields of discovery, with the view of bene- %0a%3c fitting mankind at large, that for this long time past it has been %0a%3c the greatest effort of the ingenuity of each, to keep to himself %0a%3c the successful results of the experience of former ages, and so %0a%3c bury them for ever! %0a%3c %0a%3c And yet, by Hercules! a single invention before now has %0a%3c elevated men to the rank of gods; and how many an individual %0a%3c has had his name immortalized in being bestowed upon some %0a%3c plant which he was the first to discover, thanks to the %0a%3c gratitude which prompted a succeeding age to make some %0a%3c adequate return! If it had been expended solely upon the %0a%3c plants which are grown to please the eye, or which invite %0a%3c us by their nutrimental properties, this laborious research on %0a%3c the part of the ancients would not have been so surprising; %0a%3c hut in addition to this, we find them climbing by devious %0a%3c tracts to the very summit of mountains, penetrating to the very %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 78 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c pliny’s natural history. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XXY. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c heart of wilds and deserts, and searching into every vein and %0a%3c fibre of the earth—and all this, to discover the hidden virtues %0a%3c of every root, the properties of the leaf ot every plant, and the %0a%3c various purposes to which they might be applied; converting %0a%3c thereby those vegetable productions, which the very beasts of %0a%3c the field refuse to touch, into so many instruments for our %0a%3c welfare. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 2. (2.) -THE LATIN AUTHORS WHO HAVE WRITTEN UPON %0a%3c %0a%3c THESE PLANTS. %0a%3c %0a%3c This subject has not been treated of by the writers in our %0a%3c own language so extensively as it deserves, eager as they have %0a%3c proved themselves to make enquiry into everything that is %0a%3c either meritorious or profitable. M. Cato, that great master %0a%3c in all useful knowledge, was the first, and, for a long time, the %0a%3c only author who treated of this branch 1 of learning; and %0a%3c briefly as he has touched upon it, he has not omitted to make %0a%3c some mention of the remedial treatment of cattle. After him, %0a%3c another illustrious personage, C. Valgius, 2 a man distinguished %0a%3c for his erudition, commenced a treatise upon the same subject, %0a%3c which he dedicated to the late Emperor Augustus, but left %0a%3c unfinished. At the beginning of his preface, replete as it is %0a%3c with a spirit of piety, 3 he expresses a hope that the majestic %0a%3c sway of that prince may ever prove a most efficient remedy %0a%3c for all the evils to which mankind are exposed. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 3.-AT WHAT PERIOD THE ROMANS ACQUIRED SOME KNOW¬ %0a%3c %0a%3c LEDGE OF THIS SUBJECT. %0a%3c %0a%3c The only 4 person among us, at least so far as I have been able %0a%3c to ascertain, who had treated of this subject before the time of %0a%3c Valgius, was Pompeius Lenseus, 5 the freedman of Fompeius %0a%3c Magnus; and it was in his day, I find, that this branch of %0a%3c knowledge first began to be cultivated among us. Mithridates, %0a%3c the most powerful monarch of that period, and who was finally %0a%3c conquered by Pompeius, is generally thought to have been a %0a%3c %0a%3c 1 As Fee remarks, it is more as a writer upon Agriculture than upon %0a%3c Materia Mcdica, that Cato is entitled to the thanks of posterity. %0a%3c %0a%3c 2 See end of B. xx. - %0a%3c %0a%3c 3 His piety, apparently, was tainted with adulation. %0a%3c %0a%3c 4 With the exception of Cato, of course. %0a%3c %0a%3c 5 See end of B. xiv. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 3.] the Homans’ fihst knowledge of wild plants. 79 %0a%3c %0a%3c more zealous promoter of discoveries for the benefit of mankind, %0a%3c than any of his predecessors—a fact evinced not only by many %0a%3c positive proofs, but by universal report as well. It was be %0a%3c who first thought, the proper precautions being duly taken, of %0a%3c drinking poison every day ; it being his object, by becoming / %0a%3c habituated to it, to neutralize its dangerous effects. This * %0a%3c prince was the first discoverer too of the various kinds of anti¬ %0a%3c dotes, one® of which, indeed, still retains his name; and it is %0a%3c generally supposed that he was the first to employ the blood %0a%3c of the ducks of Pontus as an ingredient in antidotes, from the %0a%3c circumstance that they derive their nutriment from poisons. 6 7 %0a%3c %0a%3c It was to Mithridates that Asclepiades, 8 that celebrated %0a%3c physician, dedicated his works, still extant, and sent them, as a %0a%3c substitute for his own personal attendance, when requested by %0a%3c that monarch to leave Itome and reside at his court. It is a %0a%3c well-known fact, that this prince was the only person that was %0a%3c ever able to converse in so many as two-and-twenty languages, %0a%3c and that, during the whole fifty-six years of his reign, he never %0a%3c required the services of an interpreter when conversing with %0a%3c any individuals of the numerous nations that were subject to %0a%3c his sway. %0a%3c %0a%3c Among the other gifts of extraordinary genius with which %0a%3c he was endowed, Mithridates displayed a peculiar fondness for %0a%3c enquiries into the medical art; and gathering items of informa¬ %0a%3c tion from all his subjects, extended, as they were, over a large %0a%3c proportion of the world, it was his habit to make copies %0a%3c of their communications, and to take notes of the results which %0a%3c upon experiment had been produced. These memoranda, which %0a%3c he kept in his private cabinet, 9 fell into the hands of Pompeius, %0a%3c when he took possession of the royal treasures; who at once %0a%3c commissioned his freedman, Lenteus the grammarian, to trans¬ %0a%3c late them into the Latin language : the result of which was, %0a%3c that his victory was equally conducive to the benefit of the %0a%3c republic and of mankind at large. %0a%3c %0a%3c 6 See c. 79 of this Book: also B. xxiii. c. 77, and B. xxix. c. 8. %0a%3c %0a%3c 7 A mere prejudice, arising from the fact that numerous poisonous plants %0a%3c grew in the countries on the shores of the Euxine.

Among them, Crateuas, %0a%3c Dionysius, and Metrodorus, adopted a very attractive method %0a%3c of description, though one which has done little more than %0a%3c prove the remarkable difficulties which attended it. It was %0a%3c their plan to delineate the various plants in colours, and then %0a%3c to add in writing a description of the properties which they %0a%3c possessed. Pictures, however, are very apt to mislead, and %0a%3c more particularly where such a number of tints is required, %0a%3c for the imitation of nature with any success; in addition to %0a%3c which, the diversity of copyists from the original paintings, %0a%3c and their comparative degrees of skill, add very considerably %0a%3c to the chances of losing the necessary degree of resemblance %0a%3c to the originals. And then, besides, it is not sufficient to de- %0a%3c lineate a plant as it appears at one period only, as it presents %0a%3c a different appearance at each of the four seasons of the year. 11 ’ %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 5.—THE FIRST GREEK AUTHORS WHO WROTE UPON PLANTS. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence it is that other writers have confined themselves to %0a%3c a verbal description of the plants; indeed some of them have %0a%3c not so much as described them even, but have contented them¬ %0a%3c selves for the most part with a bare recital of their names, %0a%3c considering it sufficient if they pointed out their virtues and %0a%3c properties to such as might feel inclined to make further en¬ %0a%3c quiries into the subject. Nor is this a kind of knowledge %0a%3c by any means difficult to obtain; at all events, so far as re¬ %0a%3c gards myself, with the exception of a very few, it has been %0a%3c my good fortune to examine them all, aided by the scientific %0a%3c researches of Antonius Castor, 11 who in our time enjoyed the %0a%3c highest reputation for an intimate acquaintance with this %0a%3c branch of knowledge. I had the opportunity of visiting his %0a%3c garden, in which, though he had passed his hundredth year, he %0a%3c cultivated vast numbers of plants with the greatest care. %0a%3c Though he had reached this great age, he had never experienced %0a%3c %0a%3c 10 The four great changes in plants, though not always at the four %0a%3c seasons of the year, are the budding and foliation, the blossoming, the %0a%3c fructification, and the fall of the leaf. u See end of B. xx. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 5.] GREEK AUTHORS WHO HAVE WRITTEN ON PLANTS. 81 %0a%3c %0a%3c any bodily ailment, and neither his memory nor his natural %0a%3c vigour had been the least impaired by the lapse of time. %0a%3c %0a%3c There was nothing more highly admired than an intimate %0a%3c knowledge of plants, in ancient times. It is long since the %0a%3c means were discovered of calculating before-hand, not only %0a%3c the day or the night, but the very hour even at which an %0a%3c eclipse of the sun or moon is to take place ; and yet the greater %0a%3c part of the lower classes still remain firmly persuaded that %0a%3c these phenomena are brought about by compulsion, through the %0a%3c agency of herbs and enchantments, and that the knowledge of %0a%3c this art is confined almost exclusively to females. What %0a%3c country, in fact, is not filled with the fabulous stories about %0a%3c Medea of Colchis and other sorceresses, the Italian Circe in %0a%3c particular, who has been elevated to the rank of a divinity %0a%3c even ? It is with reference to her, I am of opinion, that %0a%3c JEschylus, 12 one of the most ancient of the poets, asserts that %0a%3c Italy is covered with plants endowed with potent effects, and %0a%3c that many writers say the same of Circeii, 13 the place of her %0a%3c abode. Another great proof too that such is the case, is the %0a%3c fact, that the nation of the Marsi, 14 descendants of a son of %0a%3c Circe, are well known still to possess the art of taming ser¬ %0a%3c pents. %0a%3c %0a%3c Homer, that great parent of the learning and traditions of %0a%3c antiquit}’, while extolling the fame of Circe in many other %0a%3c respects, assigns to Egypt the glory of having first discovered %0a%3c the properties of plants, and that too at a time when the %0a%3c portion of that country which is now watered by the river %0a%3c lulus was not in existence, having been formed at a more recent %0a%3c period by the alluvion 15 of that river. At all events, he states 18 %0a%3c that numerous Egyptian plants were sent to the Helena of his %0a%3c story, by the wife of the king of that country, together with %0a%3c the celebrated nepenthes, 17 which ensured oblivion of all %0a%3c sorrows and forgetfulness of the past, a potion which Helena %0a%3c was to administer to all mortals. The first person, however, %0a%3c of whom the remembrance has come down to us, as having %0a%3c %0a%3c 12 There is little doubt that he alludes to the passage of JEschylus, %0a%3c quoted by Theophrastus, Hist.

Homer also speaks of several other plants by name, of %0a%3c which we shall have occasion to make further mention in their %0a%3c appropriate places. %0a%3c %0a%3c In later times again, Pythagoras, that celebrated philosopher, %0a%3c was the first to write a treatise on the properties of plants, a %0a%3c work in which he attributes the origin and discovery of them %0a%3c to Apollo, iEsculapius, and the immortal gods in general. %0a%3c Democritus too, composed a similar work. Both of these philo¬ %0a%3c sophers had visited the magicians of Persia, Arabia, ^Ethiopia, %0a%3c and Egypt, and so astounded were the ancients at their recitals, %0a%3c as to learn to make assertions which transcend all belief. %0a%3c Xanthus, the author of some historical works, tells us, in the %0a%3c first of them, that a young dragon 19 was restored to life by its %0a%3c parent through the agency of a plant to which he gives the %0a%3c name of “ ballis,” and that one Tylon, who had been killed by %0a%3c a dragon, was restored to life and health by similar means. %0a%3c Juba too assures us that in Arabia a man was resuscitated by %0a%3c the agency of a certain plant. Democritus has asserted—and %0a%3c Theophrastus believes it—that there is a certain herb in %0a%3c existence, which, upon being carried thither by a bird, the name %0a%3c of which we have already 20 given, has the effect, by the contact %0a%3c solely, of instantaneously drawing a wedge from a tree, when %0a%3c driven home by the shepherds into the wood. %0a%3c %0a%3c These marvels, incredible as they are, excite our admiration %0a%3c nevertheless, and extort from us the admission that, making %0a%3c all due allowance, there is much in them that is based on %0a%3c truth. Hence it is too that I find it the opinion of most %0a%3c writers, that there is nothing which cannot be effected by the %0a%3c agency of plants, but that the properties of by far the greater %0a%3c part of them remain as yet unknown. In the number of %0a%3c these was Herophilus, a celebrated physician, a saying of whose %0a%3c is reported, to the effect that some plants may possibly exercise %0a%3c a beneficial influence, if only trodden under foot. Be this as %0a%3c it may, it has been remarked more than once, that wounds and %0a%3c %0a%3c 18 See B. xxi. cc. 21, 84. 19 Or serpent. %0a%3c %0a%3c 20 In B. x. c. 20. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 6.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c MEDICINAL PLANTS. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 83 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c maladies are sometimes inflamed 51 upon the sudden approach of %0a%3c persons who have been journeying on foot. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 6.-WHY A FEW OF THE PLANTS ONLY HAVE BEEN USED %0a%3c %0a%3c MEDICINALLY.

THE BRITANNICA I FIVE REMEDIES. %0a%3c %0a%3c Such was the state of medical knowledge in ancient times, %0a%3c wholly concealed as it was in the language of the Greeks. But %0a%3c the main reason why the medicinal properties of most plants %0a%3c remain still unknown, is the fact that they have been tested %0a%3c 6olely by rustics and illiterate people, such being the only class %0a%3c of persons that live in the midst of them: in addition to %0a%3c which, so vast is the multitude of medical men always at hand, %0a%3c that the public are careless of making any enquiries about %0a%3c them. Indeed, many of those plants, the medicinal properties %0a%3c of which have been discovered, are still destitute of names— %0a%3c 6uch, for instance, as the one which we mentioned 22 when speak¬ %0a%3c ing of the cultivation of grain, and which we know for certain %0a%3c will have the effect of keeping birds away from the crops, if %0a%3c buried at the four corners of the field. %0a%3c %0a%3c But the most disgraceful cause of all, why so few simples %0a%3c are known, is the fact that those even who are acquainted %0a%3c with them are unwilling to impart their knowledge ; as though, %0a%3c forsooth, they should lose for ever anything that they might %0a%3c think fit to communicate to others ! Added to all this, there is %0a%3c no well-ascertained method to guide us to the acquisition of this %0a%3c kind of knowledge; for, as to the discoveries that have been %0a%3c made already, they have been due, some of them, to mere %0a%3c accident, and others again, to say the truth, to the interposition %0a%3c of the Deity. %0a%3c %0a%3c Down to our own times, the bite of the mad dog, the symp¬ %0a%3c toms of which are a dread of water and an aversion to every %0a%3c kiud of beverage, was incurable ;- 3 and it was only recently that %0a%3c %0a%3c 21 Most probably by the agency of “ feverish expectation ” on the %0a%3c part of the patient. 22 In B. xviii. c. 45. %0a%3c %0a%3c 23 As Fee remarks, this dreadful malady is still incurable, notwithstand¬ %0a%3c ing the eulogiums which have been lavished upon the virtues of the Scu¬ %0a%3c tellaria laterifolia of Linnaeus, the Alisma plantago, Genista tinctoria, and %0a%3c other plants, as specifics for its cure. %0a%3c %0a%3c a 2 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 84 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c pliny’s natural history. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XXV, %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c the mother of a soldier who was serving in the pnetorian guard, %0a%3c Teceived a warning in a dream, to send her son the root of %0a%3c the wild rose, known as the cynorrhodos, 24 a plant the beauty %0a%3c of which had attracted her attention in a shrubbery the %0a%3c day before, and to request him to drink the extract of it. The %0a%3c army was then serving in Lacetania, the part of Spain which %0a%3c lies nearest to Italy; and it so happened that the soldier, %0a%3c having been bitten by a dog, was just beginning to manifest a %0a%3c horror of water when his mother’s letter reached him, in %0a%3c which she entreated him to obey the words of this divine %0a%3c warning. He accordingly complied with her request, and, %0a%3c against all hope or expectation, his life was saved; a result 13 %0a%3c which has been experienced by all who have since availed them¬ %0a%3c selves of the same resource. Before this, the cynorrhodos had %0a%3c been only recommended by writers for one medicinal purpose; %0a%3c the spongy excrescences, they say, which grow 26 in the midst of %0a%3c its thorns, reduced to ashes and mixed with honey, will make the %0a%3c hair grow again when it has been lost by alopecy. I know too, %0a%3c for a fact, that in the same province there was lately discovered %0a%3c in the land belonging to a person with whom I was staying, a %0a%3c stalked plant, the name given to which was dracunculus. 27 This %0a%3c plant, about an inch in thickness, and spotted with various %0a%3c colours, like a viper’s skin, was generally reported to be an %0a%3c effectual preservative against the sting of all kinds of serpents. %0a%3c I should remark, however, that it is a different plant from the %0a%3c one of the same name of which mention has been made in the %0a%3c preceding Book, 26 having altogether another shape and appear¬ %0a%3c ance. There is also another marvellous property belonging to %0a%3c it: in spring, when the serpents begin to cast their slough, it %0a%3c shoots up from the ground to the height of about a couple of %0a%3c feet, and again, when they retire for the winter it conceals %0a%3c itself within the earth, nor is there a serpent to be seen so long %0a%3c as it remains out of sight. Even if this plant did nothing %0a%3c else but warn us of impending danger, and tell us when to %0a%3c be on our guard, it could not be looked upon otherwise than %0a%3c as a beneficent provision made by Nature in our behalves. %0a%3c %0a%3c 21 Dog-rose, or eglantine.

It is not, however, the animals only that are endowed %0a%3c with certain baneful and noxious properties, but, sometimes, %0a%3c waters 29 even, and localities as well. Upon one occasion, in his %0a%3c German campaign, Germanicus Caesar had pitched his camp %0a%3c beyond the river Ithenus; the only fresh water to be obtained %0a%3c being that of a single spring in the vicinity of the sea-shore. %0a%3c It was found, however, that within two years the habitual use %0a%3c of this water was productive of loss of the teeth and a total %0a%3c relaxation of the joints of the knees: the names given to %0a%3c these maladies, by medical men, were “ stomacace” 30 and %0a%3c “ sceloturbe.” A remedy for them was discovered, however, %0a%3c in the plant known as the “ britannica,” 31 which is good, not %0a%3c only for diseases of the sinews and mouth, but for quinzy 32 also, %0a%3c and injuries inflicted by serpents. This plant has dark oblong %0a%3c leaves and a swarthy root: the name given to the flower of it %0a%3c is “ vibones,” 33 and if it is gathered and eaten before thunder %0a%3c has been heard, it will ensure safety in every respect. The %0a%3c Irish, a nation then on terms of friendship with us, and within %0a%3c whose territories the Homan army was encamped, pointed out %0a%3c this plant to our soldiers: the name 31 given to it, however, %0a%3c %0a%3c 29 As P’ee remarks, the influence of water impregnated with selenite %0a%3c upon*the health is well known. %0a%3c %0a%3c 30 Fee says that this disease was an “ intense gastritis, productive of a %0a%3c fetid breath.” It would seem, however, to be neither more nor less than %0a%3c the malady now known as “ scurvy of the gums.” Galen describes the %0a%3c “sceloturbe,” as a kind of paralysis. “Stomacace” means “ disease of %0a%3c the mouth ;” “ sceloturbe ” “ disease of the legs.” %0a%3c %0a%3c 31 Sprengel and Desfontaines identify it with the Itumex aquaticus, but %0a%3c Fee considers it to be the Inula Britannica of Linnmus. The Statice %0a%3c armeria, Statice plantaginea, and Polygonum persicaria have also been %0a%3c suggested. %0a%3c %0a%3c 32 The pseudo-Apuleius, in B. xxix. t. 7, says, that if gathered before %0a%3c thunder has been heard, it will be a preservative against quinzy for a whole %0a%3c year. %0a%3c %0a%3c 33 The flower of the Inula Britannica, Fee says, is much more likely, %0a%3c from its peculiarities, to have merited a peculiar name, than that of the %0a%3c liuraex. %0a%3c %0a%3c 34 Lipsius, in his Commentaries upon Tacitus, Ann. i. 63, has very %0a%3c satisfactorily shown that it did not derive its name from the islands of %0a%3c Britain, but from a local appellation, the name given by the natives to the %0a%3c marshy tracts upon the banks of the Ems, between Lingen and Covoerden, %0a%3c which are still known as the “ Bretaasche Heyde.” Hunting and Poin- %0a%3c 6 inet de Sivry suggest that it may have received its name from being used %0a%3c as a strengthener of the teeth in their sockets, being compounded of the %0a%3c words tann, “ tooth,” and brita, “ to break.” %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 86 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c flint’s natural history. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XIV. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c rather surprises me, though possibly it may have been so %0a%3c called because the shores of Britannia are in the vicinity, und %0a%3c only separated by the ocean. At all events, it was not called %0a%3c by this name from the fact of its growing there in any great %0a%3c abundance, that is quite certain, for at the time I am speaking %0a%3c of, Britannia was still independent . 35 %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 7 .- WHAT DISEASES ARE ATTENDED WITH TnE GREATEST PAIN, %0a%3c %0a%3c NAMES OF PERSONS WHO HAVE DISCOVERED FAMOUS PLANTS. %0a%3c %0a%3c In former times there was a sort of ambition, as it were, of %0a%3c adopting plants, by bestowing upon them one’s name, a thing %0a%3c that has been done before now by kings even, as we shall have %0a%3c occasion to show : 36 so desirable a thing did it appear to have %0a%3c made the discovery of some plant, and thus far to have contri¬ %0a%3c buted to the benefit of mankind. At the present day, however, %0a%3c it is far from impossible that there may be some who will %0a%3c look upon these researches of ours as frivolous even, so distaste¬ %0a%3c ful to a life of ease and luxury are the very things which bo %0a%3c greatly conduce to our welfare. %0a%3c %0a%3c Still, however, it will be only right to mention in the first %0a%3c place those plants the discoverers of which are known, their %0a%3c various properties being classified 37 according to the several %0a%3c maladies for the treatment of which they are respectively em¬ %0a%3c ployed : in taking a review of which one cannot do otherwise %0a%3c than bewail the unhappy lot of mankind, subject as it is, in %0a%3c addition to chances and changes, and those new afflictions which %0a%3c every hour is bringing with it, to thousands of diseases which %0a%3c menace the existence of each mortal being. It would seem %0a%3c almost an act of folly to attempt to determine which of these %0a%3c diseases is attended with the most excruciating pain, seeing %0a%3c that every one is of opinion that the malady with which for %0a%3c the moment he himself is afflicted, is the most excruciating %0a%3c and insupportable. The general experience, however, of the %0a%3c present age has come to the conclusion, that the most agonizing %0a%3c torments are those attendant upon strangury, resulting from %0a%3c calculi in the bladder ; next to them, those arising from ma¬ %0a%3c ladies of the stomach ; and in the third place, those caused by %0a%3c pains and affections of the head; for it is more generally in %0a%3c %0a%3c 35 And therefore comparatively unknown. %0a%3c %0a%3c 36 In c. 33, et seq., of this Book. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 37 In the next Book. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 8.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c MOLY. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 87 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c these cases, we find, and not in others, that patients are %0a%3c tempted to commit suicide. %0a%3c %0a%3c For my own part, I am surprised that the Greek authors %0a%3c have gone so far as to give a description of noxious plants %0a%3c even; in using which term, I wish it to be understood that %0a%3c I do not mean the poisonous plants merely; for such is our %0a%3c tenure of life that death is often a port of refuge to even the %0a%3c best of men. We meet too, with one case of a somewhat %0a%3c similar nature, where M. Vurro speaks of Servius Clodius , 38 a %0a%3c member of the Equestrian order, being so dreadfully tormented %0a%3c with gout, that he had his legs rubbed all over with poisons, %0a%3c the result of which was, that from that time forward all sensa¬ %0a%3c tion, equally with all pain, was deadened in those parts of his %0a%3c body. Hut what excuse, I say, can there be for making the %0a%3c world acquainted with plants, the only result of the use of %0a%3c which is to derange the intellect, to produce abortion, and to %0a%3c cause numerous other effects equally pernicious ? So far as I am %0a%3c concerned, I shall describe neither abortives nor philtres, %0a%3c bearing in mind, as I do, that Lucullus, that most celebrated %0a%3c general, died of the effects of a philtre . 39 Nor shall I speak %0a%3c of other ill-omened devices of magic, unless it be to give %0a%3c warning against them, or to expose them, for I most emphati¬ %0a%3c cally condemn all faith and belief in them. It will suffice for %0a%3c me, and I shall have abundantly done my duty, if I point out %0a%3c those plants which were made for the benefit of mankind, and %0a%3c the properties of which have been discovered in the lapse of %0a%3c time. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c chap. 8.

It grows in umbrageous mountain localities, and puts %0a%3c forth a stem amid the leaves, some four fingers in height, at the %0a%3c summit of which are four or five heads resembling Greek %0a%3c nuts 5 - in appearance ; enclosed in which, there is a considerable %0a%3c quantity of seed of a red or black colour. This plant is a %0a%3c preservative against the illusions 53 practised by the Fauni in %0a%3c sleep. It is generally recommended to take it up at night; %0a%3c for if the wood-pecker 61 of Mars should perceive a person doing %0a%3c so, it will immediately attack his eyes in defence of the plant. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 11 . -THE PANACES ASCLEIUON : TWO KEMEDIES. %0a%3c %0a%3c The panaces, by its very name , 55 gives assurance of a remedy for %0a%3c all diseases: there are numerous kinds of it, and the discovery %0a%3c of its properties has been attributed to the gods. One of these %0a%3c kinds is known by the additional name of “ asclepion ,” 56 in %0a%3c commemoration of the circumstance that JEsculapius gave the %0a%3c name of Panacia 57 to his daughter. The juice of it, as we have %0a%3c had occasion to remark already , 53 coagulates like that of %0a%3c fennel-giaut; the root is covered with a thick rind of a salt %0a%3c flavour. %0a%3c %0a%3c After this plant has been taken up, it is a point religiously %0a%3c observed to fill the hole with various kinds of grain, a sort of %0a%3c expiation, as it were, to the earth. We have already 59 stated, %0a%3c when speaking of the exotic productions, where and in what %0a%3c manner this juice is prepared, and what kind is the most %0a%3c esteemed. That which is imported from Macedonia is known %0a%3c as “ bucolicon,” from the fact that the neatherds there are %0a%3c in the habit of collecting it as it spontaneously exudes: it %0a%3c evaporates, however, -with the greatest rapidity.

The leaf is similar to that of %0a%3c lapathum, except that it is larger and more hairy ; the flower %0a%3c is of a golden colour, and the root diminutive. It grows in rich, %0a%3c unctuous soils. The flower of this plant is extremely effi¬ %0a%3c cacious ; hence it is that it is more generally used than the %0a%3c kinds previously mentioned. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 14 . -THE PANACES CENTAURION OR PHARNACI0N : %0a%3c %0a%3c THREE REMEDIES. %0a%3c %0a%3c A fourth kind of panaces, discovered also by Chiron, is %0a%3c known by the additional name of “ centaurion :” 63 it is also %0a%3c called “ pharnacion,” from King Pharnaces, it being a matter %0a%3c in dispute whether it Avas really discovered by Chiron or by %0a%3c that prince. It is grown from seed , 04 and the leaves of it are %0a%3c longer than those of the other kinds, and serrated at the edge. %0a%3c The root, which is odoriferous, is dried in the shade, and is %0a%3c used for imparting an aroma to Avine. Some writers distin- %0a%3c %0a%3c 60 Identified with the Laserpitium Chironiam of Linnaeus, otherwise %0a%3c called Pastinaca opopanax.

The stem is thin, about four fingers in length, the %0a%3c flower red, and the leaves like those of coriander. It is found %0a%3c growing in the vicinity of lakes and rivers, and is extremely %0a%3c efficacious for the cure of all wounds made by iron. 66 %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 16 . -THE AMrELOS CHIRONIA : ONE REMEDY. %0a%3c %0a%3c The ainpelos Chironia 67 also, which we have already 68 men¬ %0a%3c tioned when speaking of the vines, is a discovery due to %0a%3c Chiron. We have spoken too, on a previous occasion, 69 of a %0a%3c plant, the discovery of which is attributed to Minerva. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 17.-HYOSCYAMOS, KNOWN ALSO AS TnE APOLLINARIS OR %0a%3c %0a%3c ALTEBCCM ; FIVE VARIETIES OF IT : THREE REMEDIES. %0a%3c %0a%3c To Hercules also is attributed the discovery of the plant %0a%3c known as the “ apollinaris,” and, among the Arabians, as the %0a%3c “altercum” or “ altercangenum by the Greeks it is called %0a%3c “ hyoscyamos.” 70 There are several varieties of it; one of %0a%3c them, 71 with a black seed, flowers bordering on purple, and a %0a%3c prickly stem, growing in Galatia. The common kind 72 again, %0a%3c is whiter, more shrublike, and taller than the poppy. The %0a%3c 6eed of a third variety is similar to that of irio 73 in appearance; %0a%3c but they have, all of them, the effect of producing vertigo and %0a%3c insanity. A fourth 74 kind again is soft, lanuginous, and more %0a%3c unctuous than the others ; the seed of it is white, and it grows %0a%3c in maritime localities. It is this kind that medical men %0a%3c %0a%3c 65 Hardouin identifies it with the Geranium Robertianum of Linnaeus; %0a%3c Sprengel and Desfontaines with the Phellandrium mutellina of Linnaeus; %0a%3c Columna with the Sanicula; Sibthorpe with the Scrofularia lucida; and %0a%3c M. Fraiis with the Scrofula chrysanthemifolia of Linnaeus. Fee expresses %0a%3c himself unable to speak with any certainty on the subject. %0a%3c %0a%3c 66 Whence its name “ sidereon.” 67 Or “ Chironian vine.” %0a%3c %0a%3c 68 In B. xxiii. c. 17. 69 In B. xxii. c. 20. %0a%3c %0a%3c 70 “ Swine’s bean ”—our henbane. %0a%3c %0a%3c 71 The Hyoscyamus reticulatus of Linnaeus, reticulated henbane. %0a%3c %0a%3c 72 The Hyoscyamus niger of Linnaeus, black henbane. %0a%3c %0a%3c 73 See B. xviii. c. 22, and B. xxii. c. 75.

Hyoscyamos, like wine, has the property of %0a%3c flying to the head, and consequently of acting injuriously upon %0a%3c the mental faculties. %0a%3c %0a%3c The seed is either used in its natural state, or else the juice %0a%3c of it is extracted: the juice also of the stem and leaves is %0a%3c sometimes extracted, separately from the seed. The root is %0a%3c sometimes made use of; but the employment of this plant in %0a%3c any way for medical purposes is, in my opinion, highly dan- %0a%3c gerous. For it is a fact well ascertained, that the leaves even %0a%3c will exercise a deleterious effect upon the mind, if more than %0a%3c four are taken at a time; though the ancients were of opinion %0a%3c that the leaves act as a febrifuge, taken in wine. From the %0a%3c seed, as already 76 stated, an oil is extracted, which, injected %0a%3c into the ears, deranges the intellect. It is a singular thing, %0a%3c but we find remedies mentioned for those who have taken %0a%3c this juice, as though for a poison, while at the same time we %0a%3c find it prescribed as a potion among the various remedies. %0a%3c In this way it is that experiments are multiplied without end, %0a%3c even to forcing the very poisons themselves to act as an¬ %0a%3c tidotes. %0a%3c %0a%3c CnAP. 18.

In %0a%3c the female plant the seed hangs more loosely, and is of a white %0a%3c colour. The leaves of the male plant are swarthy, while %0a%3c those of the female are whiter: the root, which is made no %0a%3c use of, is very diminutive. %0a%3c %0a%3c Both of these plants grow in cultivated champaign local¬ %0a%3c ities. A marvellous property is mentioned as belonging to %0a%3c them: the male plant, they say, 80 ensures the conception of %0a%3c male children, the female plant of females; a result which is %0a%3c ensured by drinking the juice in raisin wine, the moment after %0a%3c conception, or by eating the leaves, boiled with oil and salt, %0a%3c or raw with vinegar. Some persons, again, boil the plant %0a%3c in a new earthen vessel with heliotropium and two or three %0a%3c ears of corn, till it is thoroughly done; and say that the decoc¬ %0a%3c tion should be taken in drink by the female, and the plant %0a%3c eaten for three days successively, the regimen being com¬ %0a%3c menced the second day of menstruation. This done, on the %0a%3c fourth day she must take a bath, immediately after which the %0a%3c sexual congress must take place. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hippocrates 81 has lavished marvellous encomiums upon these %0a%3c plants for the maladies of females, while at the present day %0a%3c no physician recognizes their utility for such purpose. It was %0a%3c his practice to employ them for affections of the uterus, in the %0a%3c form of a pessary, in combination with honey, rose-oil, oil of %0a%3c iris, or oil of lilies. He employed them also as an emmena- %0a%3c gogue, and for the purpose of bringing away the after-birth; %0a%3c effects which are equally produced, according to him, by taking %0a%3c them in drink, or using them in the form of a fomentation. It %0a%3c was his practice also, to inject the juice ot these plants in cases %0a%3c of fetid odours of the ears, and then to wash the ear with old %0a%3c wine. The leaves also were used by him as a cataplasm for %0a%3c the abdomen, defluxions of the eyes, strangury, and affections %0a%3c of the bladder; a decoction too, of the plants is prescribed by %0a%3c him, with frankincense and myrrh. %0a%3c %0a%3c For the purpose of relaxing 83 the bowels, or in cases of fever, %0a%3c %0a%3c w The male, as Fee suggests, bears no seed at all. %0a%3c %0a%3c 811 A mere absurdity, of course. %0a%3c %0a%3c 81 De Nat.

Some persons have been of opinion, that %0a%3c as a purgative the two kinds of mercurialis ought to be used %0a%3c together, or else that a decoction should be made of the plant %0a%3c in combination with mallows. These plants act as a detergent %0a%3c upon the chest, and carry off the bilious secretions, but they are %0a%3c apt to be injurious to the stomach. We shall have to speak %0a%3c further of their properties on the appropriate occasions. 83 %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 19.- THE ACHILLEOS, SIBEKITIS, PANACES HEIIACLEON, %0a%3c %0a%3c MILLEFOLIUM, OR SCOPiE REGIiE ; SIX VARIETIES OF II: %0a%3c %0a%3c THREE REMEDIES. %0a%3c %0a%3c Achilles too, the pupil of Chiron, discovered a plant which %0a%3c heals wounds, and which, as being his discovery, is known as %0a%3c the “ achilleos.” It was by the aid of this plant, they say. %0a%3c that he cured Telephus. Other authorities, however, assert that %0a%3c he was the first 84 to discover that verdigris 85 is an extremely %0a%3c useful ingredient in plasters ; and hence it is that he is some¬ %0a%3c times represented in pictures as scraping with his sword the %0a%3c rust from off a spear 86 into the wound of Telephus. Some again, %0a%3c are of opinion that he made use of both remedies. %0a%3c %0a%3c By some persons this plant is called “ panaces heracleon,” %0a%3c by others, “ sideritis,” 87 and by the people of our country, %0a%3c “ millefolium : ’ ,88 the stalk of it, they say, is a cubit in length, %0a%3c branchy, and covered from the bottom with leaves somewhat %0a%3c smaller than those of fennel. Other authorities, however, %0a%3c while admitting that this last plant is good for wounds, affirm %0a%3c that the genuine achilleos has a bluish stem a foot in length, %0a%3c %0a%3c 83 B. xxvi. ec, 74, 76, 89. %0a%3c %0a%3c 84 Both stories are equally improbable. %0a%3c %0a%3c 85 See B. xxxiv. c. 45. %0a%3c %0a%3c 86 The weapons in early time, it must be remembered, were made of %0a%3c copper or bronze. %0a%3c %0a%3c 81 The third Sideritis of Dioscorides is thought to be the same with the %0a%3c Heracleon siderion of c. 15 of this Book. Pliny evidently confounds the %0a%3c Achillea and the Sideritis, totally different plants. The Achillea is identified %0a%3c by Fee with the Achillea tomentosa or abrotonifolia of Linnaeus. As to %0a%3c the Sideritis, see B. xxvi. c. 12.

Others again, maintain that %0a%3c it has a squared stem, that the heads of it are small and like %0a%3c those of horehound, 89 and that the leaves are similar to those %0a%3c of the quercus—they say too, that this last has the property of %0a%3c uniting the sinews when cut asunder. Another statement is, %0a%3c that the sideritis 90 is a plant that grows on garden walls, and %0a%3c that it emits, when bruised, a fetid smell; that there is also %0a%3c another plant, very similar to it, but with a whiter and more %0a%3c unctuous leaf, a more delicate stem, and mostly found growing %0a%3c iq vineyards. %0a%3c %0a%3c They speak also of another 91 sideritis, with a stem two %0a%3c cubits in length, and diminutive branches of a triangular %0a%3c shape: the leaf, they say, resembles that of fern, and has a %0a%3c long footstalk, the seed being similar to that of beet. All %0a%3c these plants, it is said, are remarkably good for the treatment %0a%3c of wounds. The one with the largest leaf is known among %0a%3c us by the name of “scopoe regiae,” 93 and is used for the cure %0a%3c of quinzy in swine. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 20. —THE.

It will be the best plan, therefore, to %0a%3c take this opportunity of treating of the several varieties of %0a%3c hellebore. The two principal kinds are the white 91 and the %0a%3c black; 98 though, according to most authorities, this difference %0a%3c exists in the root only. There are some authors, however, %0a%3c who assure us that the leaves of the black hellebore are similar %0a%3c to those of the plane-tree, only darker, more diminutive, and %0a%3c more jagged at the edges : and who say, that the white hel¬ %0a%3c lebore has leaves like those of beet when first shooting, %0a%3c though at the same time of a more swarthy 7 colour, with reddish %0a%3c veins on the under side. The stem, in both kinds, is feru- %0a%3c laceous, a palm 99 in height, and covered with coats like those %0a%3c of the bulbs, the root, too, being fibrous like that of the onion. 1 %0a%3c %0a%3c 96 The Teucrium lucidum of Linnaeus: though, as Fee says, there is %0a%3c little similarity between it and hyssop, or between its leaves and those of %0a%3c the bean. See B. xxiv. c. 80. %0a%3c %0a%3c 97 Identified by Fde with the Yeratrum album and Veratrum nigrum of %0a%3c Linnaeus, species between which there is little difference. %0a%3c %0a%3c 98 Identified by Tournefort with the Helleborus niger of Lamarck. %0a%3c Littre mentions the Helleborus orientalis of Linnmus. %0a%3c %0a%3c 99 The stem of white hellebore is much longer than this. %0a%3c %0a%3c 1 This comparison with the onion, Fee says, is altogether inexact. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 21.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c HELLEBORE. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 97 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The black hellebore kills horses, oxen, and swine ; hence it %0a%3c is that those animals avoid it, while they eat the white 3 kind. %0a%3c The proper time, thay say, for gathering this last, is harvest. %0a%3c It grows upon Mount (Eta in great abundance; and the best %0a%3c of all is that found upon one spot on that mountain, in the %0a%3c vicinity of Pyra. The black hellebore is found growing every¬ %0a%3c where, but the best is that of Mount Helicon; which is also %0a%3c equally celebrated for the qualities of its other plants. The %0a%3c white hellebore of Mount (Eta is the most highly esteemed, %0a%3c that of Pontus occupying the second place, and the produce of %0a%3c Elea the third; which last, it is generally said, grows in the %0a%3c vineyards there. The fourth rank is held by the white %0a%3c hellebore of Mount Parnassus, though it is often adulterated %0a%3c with that of the neighbouring districts of iEtolia. %0a%3c %0a%3c Of these kinds it i6 the black hellebore that is known as the %0a%3c %0a%3c melampodium it is used in fumigations, and for the purpose %0a%3c of purifying houses; cattle, too, are sprinkled with it, a certain %0a%3c form of prayer being repeated. This last plant, too, is gathered %0a%3c with more numerous ceremonies than the other: a circle is %0a%3c first traced around it with a sword, after which, the person %0a%3c about to cut it turns towards the East, and offers up a prayer, %0a%3c entreating permission of the gods to do so. At the same time %0a%3c he observes whether an eagle is in sight—for mostly while the %0a%3c plant is being gathered that bird is near at hand—and if one %0a%3c should chance to fly close at hand, it is looked upon as a presage %0a%3c that he will die within the year. The white hellebore, too, is %0a%3c gathered not without difficulty, as it is very oppressive to the %0a%3c head; more particularly if the precaution has not been used %0a%3c of eating garlic first, and of drinking wine every now and %0a%3c then, care being taken to dig up the plant as speedily as possible. %0a%3c %0a%3c Some persons call the black hellebore “ectomon,” 3 and %0a%3c others “ polyrrhizonit purges 4 by stool, while the white %0a%3c hellebore acts as an emetic, and so carries off what might other¬ %0a%3c wise have given rise to disease. In former days hellebore was %0a%3c regarded with horror, but more recently the use 5 of it has be- %0a%3c come.so familiar, that numbers of studious men are in the %0a%3c %0a%3c 5 If he would imply that they do this without inconvenience, the state¬ %0a%3c ment, Fee says, is incorrect. %0a%3c %0a%3c 3 “ Cut off,” and “ With many roots.” %0a%3c %0a%3c 1 Hellebore is no longer used, except in veterinary medicine. %0a%3c %0a%3c 5 Petronius Arbiter says that the'philosopher Cbrysippus used it. %0a%3c %0a%3c VOL.

The thinnest and %0a%3c shortest roots are selected, and among them the lower parts %0a%3c in particular, which have all the appearance of having been %0a%3c cut short ; 9 for, as to the upper part, which is the thickest, and %0a%3c bears a resemblance to an onion, it is given to dogs only, as a %0a%3c purgative. The ancients used to select those roots the rind of %0a%3c which was the most fleshy, from an idea that the pith extracted %0a%3c therefrom was of a more refined 10 nature. This substance they %0a%3c covered with wet sponges, and, when it began to swell, used %0a%3c 10 split it longitudinally with a needle; which done, the fila¬ %0a%3c ments were dried in the shade, for future use. At the presect %0a%3c day, however, the fibres 11 of the root with the thickest rind %0a%3c are selected, and given to the patient just as they are.

Some authorities have recomended mixing scammony %0a%3c with it, but salt is looked upon as more safe. If given in any %0a%3c considerable quantity in combination with a sweet substance, %0a%3c it is highly dangerous : used in the form of a fomentation, it %0a%3c disperses films upon the eyes ; and hence it is that some medical %0a%3c men have pounded it and used it for an eye-salve. It ripens %0a%3c and acts detergently upon scrofulous sores, suppurations, and %0a%3c indurated tumours, as also upon fistulas, but in this latter case %0a%3c it must be removed at the end of a couple of days.

Indeed, it was generally the practice to %0a%3c •administer other substances to promote vomiting, and to carry %0a%3c aff the hellebore by the aid of purgatives or clysters, while %0a%3c bleeding even was frequently had recourse to. In addition to %0a%3c all this, however successful the results may prove, the symptoms %0a%3c by which it is attended are really most alarming, by reason of %0a%3c %0a%3c 12 “ Squama seris.” %0a%3c %0a%3c 13 See a similar statement as to Consiligo, in B. xxvi. c. 21. %0a%3c %0a%3c 11 See B. xv. c. 7, and B. xxiv. c. 11. %0a%3c %0a%3c 15 Its properties, Fee says, are not more active than those of black helle¬ %0a%3c bore. %0a%3c %0a%3c H 2 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 100 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c FLINT*8 NATURAL HISTORY. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Boole XXV. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c the various colours which the matter vomited presents: besides %0a%3c which, after the vomiting has subsided, the physician has to %0a%3c pay the greatest attention to the nature of the alvine evacu- %0a%3c ations, the due and proper use of the bath, and the general %0a%3c regimen adopted by the patient; all of them inconveniences %0a%3c in themselves, and preceded by the terrors naturally inspired %0a%3c by the character of the drug ; for one story is, that it has the %0a%3c property of consuming flesh, if boiled with it. %0a%3c %0a%3c The great error, 16 however, on the part of the ancients wa«, %0a%3c that in consequence of these fears, they used to give it too %0a%3c sparingly, the fact being, that the larger the dose, the more %0a%3c speedily it passes through the body. Themison used to give %0a%3c no more than two drachmae, but at a later period as much as %0a%3c four drachmae was administered ; in conformity with the cele¬ %0a%3c brated eulogium passed upon it by Herophilus, 17 who was in %0a%3c the habit of comparing hellebore to a valiant general, and %0a%3c saying, that after it has set in motion all within, it is the %0a%3c first to sally forth and show the way. In addition to these %0a%3c particulars, there has been a singular discovery made: the %0a%3c hellebore which, as we have already stated, has been cut with %0a%3c a small pair of scissors, 18 is passed through a sieve, upon which %0a%3c the pith makes its way through, while the outer coat remains %0a%3c behind. The latter acts as a purgative, while the former is %0a%3c used for the purpose of arresting vomiting when that evacuation %0a%3c is in excess. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 24.- EIGHTY-EIGHT OBSERVATIONS UPON THE TWO KIMS %0a%3c %0a%3c OF HELLEBORE. %0a%3c %0a%3c In order to secure a beneficial result, due precautions must %0a%3c be taken not to administer hellebore in cloudy weather; for if %0a%3c given at such a time, it is sure to be productive of excruciating %0a%3c agonies. Indeed there is no doubt that summer is a better %0a%3c time for giving it than winter: the body too, by an abstinence %0a%3c from wine, must be prepared for it seven days previously, %0a%3c emetics being taken on the fourth and third days before, anil %0a%3c %0a%3c 16 Fee remarks, that they showed their wisdom in this. %0a%3c %0a%3c 17 Herophilus, it must be remembered, lived a considerable time be:"f' %0a%3c Themison. %0a%3c %0a%3c is “ Forficulis.” He probably refers to c. 21, where, however, he la %0a%3c mentioned only a needle —“ acus.” It is possibly a lapsus memories %0a%3c his part. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 3hap. 25.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c HELLEBORE. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 101 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ;he patient going without his evening meal the previous day. %0a%3c White hellebore, too, is administered in a sweet 19 medium, %0a%3c though lentils or pottage are found to be the best for the pur¬ %0a%3c pose. There has been a plan also, lately discovered, of splitting %0a%3c i radish, and inserting the hellebore in it, after which the %0a%3c sections arc pressed together; the object being that the strength %0a%3c )f the hellebore may be incorporated with the radish, and mo- %0a%3c iified thereby. %0a%3c %0a%3c At the end of about four hours it generally begins to be %0a%3c nought up again ; and within seven it has operated to the full %0a%3c ;xtent.

It is given %0a%3c .ess frequently too to females than to males; and persons of a %0a%3c dmorous disposition are recommended not to take it: the same %0a%3c dso, in cases where the viscera are ulcerated or tumefied, and %0a%3c nore particularly when the patient is afflicted with spitting of %0a%3c )lood, or with maladies of the side or fauces. Hellebore is ap- %0a%3c )lied, too, externally, with salted axle-grease, to morbid eruptions %0a%3c )f the body and suppurations of long standing: mixed with %0a%3c ipolenta, it destroys rats and mice. The people of Gaul, when %0a%3c Hinting, tip their arrow’s with hellebore, taking care to cut %0a%3c lway the parts about the wound in the animal so slain: the %0a%3c Hesh, they say, is all the more tender for it. Flies are destroyed %0a%3c with white hellebore, bruised and sprinkled about a place with %0a%3c milk : phthiriasis is also cured by the use of this mixture. %0a%3c %0a%3c 19 This he has stated to be attended with danger, in the case of black %0a%3c lellebore, should the dose be too strong. %0a%3c %0a%3c 20 In c. 21 of this Book. %0a%3c %0a%3c 51 Twitcliings of the mouth, which cause the patient to show his teeth, %0a%3c ike a dog. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 102 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c pliny's natural history. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XXV. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 26.

This plant, he says, %0a%3c is a cubit in height, and has a square stem, branchy, covered %0a%3c with downy leaves, and resembling the quercus 24 in appearance: %0a%3c it is found growing in Pontus, in rich, humid soils, and has a %0a%3c bitter taste. %0a%3c %0a%3c There is another 25 variety also of this plant, with a larger %0a%3c leaf, and resembling wild mint in appearance.

The stems, some three %0a%3c cubits in height and jointed, bear heads resembling those of %0a%3c the poppy. The root is large and spreading, of a reddish %0a%3c colour, tender and brittle, a couple of cubits in length, and full %0a%3c of a bitter juice, somewhat inclining to sweet. %0a%3c %0a%3c This plant grows in rich soils upon declivities; the best in %0a%3c quality being that of Arcadia, Elis, Messenia, Mount Pholoe, and %0a%3c Mount Lycmus: it grows also upon the Alps, and in numerous %0a%3c other localities, and in Lycia they prepare a lycium 30 from it. %0a%3c 8o remarkable are its properties for closing wounds, that %0a%3c pieces of meat even, it is said, are soldered together, when boiled %0a%3c with it.

It is similar to origanum %0a%3c in appearance, except that the leaves are narrower and longer. %0a%3c The stem is angular, branchy, and a palm in height; the flower %0a%3c is like that of the lychnis, 31 and the root is thin, and never %0a%3c used. It is in the juice that its medicinal properties are %0a%3c centred: it being gathered in the autumn, and the juice extracted %0a%3c from the leaves. Some persons cut up the stalks, and steep %0a%3c them for some eighteen days in water, and then extract the %0a%3c juice. %0a%3c %0a%3c In Italy this kind of centaury is known as “gall 34 of the %0a%3c earth,” from its extreme bitterness. The Gauls give it the %0a%3c name of “ exacum ;” 36 from the circumstance that, taken in %0a%3c drink, it purges off all noxious substances by alvine evacuation. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 32.-THE CENTAURIS TRIORCHIS : TWO REMEDIES. %0a%3c %0a%3c There is a third kind of centaury also, known as the %0a%3c “ centauris triorchis.” 37 It is but rarely that a person cuts it %0a%3c without wounding himself.

Fee is probably %0a%3c right in his conjecture that the Centaurea centaureum is meant; though %0a%3c Brotier and Desfontaines look upon this as being a distinct plant, and %0a%3c identify it with the Rumex sanguineus of Linnmus. %0a%3c %0a%3c 38 The root of the greater centaury, Fee remarks, is of a deep red within. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 34.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c GENTIAN. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 105 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c the protection of the triorchis, a kind of hawk, which attacks %0a%3c those who gather it; a circumstance to which it owes its %0a%3c name.

The smell of it is powerful, and the seed like %0a%3c that of ivy: it grows in wild and mountainous localities. %0a%3c We shall have to state hereafter, of what maladies it is curative, %0a%3c taken in drink, but it is as well to take the present opportunity %0a%3c of remarking that, while effecting a cure, in the male sex it %0a%3c neutralizes the generative powers. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Greeks speak 41 of this plant as being similar to the %0a%3c plantago in appearance, with a square stem, and a seed in %0a%3c capsules, interlaced like the arms of the polypus.

This %0a%3c plant has green leaves resembling those of the willow, and a %0a%3c purple 47 blossom: it has all the appearance of a shrub, the %0a%3c branches are erect, and it has a pungent smell. It is found %0a%3c growing in watery soils. The properties of it are so extremely %0a%3c powerful, that if placed upon the yoke when beasts of burden %0a%3c are restive, it will be sure to overcome all stubbornness on their %0a%3c part. 48 %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 36. -ARTEMISIA, PABTHEN1S, BOTEYS, OB AMBKOSIA: %0a%3c %0a%3c FIVE KEMEDIES. %0a%3c %0a%3c Women too have even affected an ambition to give their %0a%3c name to plants: thus, for instance, Artemisia, the wife of %0a%3c King Mausolus, adopted the plant, which before was known %0a%3c by the name of “ parthenis.” There are some persons, how- %0a%3c ever, who are of opinion that it received this surname from the %0a%3c goddess Artemis Ilithyia, 49 from the fact of its being used for %0a%3c the cure of female complaints more particularly. It is a %0a%3c plant with numerous branches, like those of wormwood, but %0a%3c the leaves of it are larger and substantial. %0a%3c %0a%3c There are two varieties of it; one has broader 50 leaves than %0a%3c the other, 51 which last is of a slender form, with a more diminu¬ %0a%3c tive leaf, and grows nowhere but in maritime districts. %0a%3c %0a%3c 46 A king of Thrace, contemporary with Alexander the Great.

By %0a%3c other persons, again, it is called “ rhopalon,” from the resem¬ %0a%3c blance of its root to a club. 84 * * * * and hence it is that %0a%3c those who take it in drink become impotent for some twelve %0a%3c days, and incapacitated for procreation. That of the first %0a%3c quality is found in Orchomenia and at Marathon : the people of %0a%3c Boeotia call it “ madon, ” and use the seed for food. It grows %0a%3c in spots covered with water; the leaves 65 of it are large, and %0a%3c float upon the surface, while others are to be seen springing %0a%3c from the roots below. The flower is very similar to a lily %0a%3c in appearance, and after the plant has shed its blossom, the %0a%3c place of the flower is occupied by a head like that of the %0a%3c poppy. The stem is slender, and the plant is usually cut in %0a%3c autumn. The root, of a swarthy hue, is dried in the sun; %0a%3c garlic 66 manifests a peculiar antipathy to it. %0a%3c %0a%3c There is another 67 nymphaea also, which grows in the river %0a%3c Peneus, in Thessaly: the root of it is white, and the head %0a%3c yellow, about the size of a rose. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 38. -TWO VARIETIES OF EUPHORBIA : FOUR REMEDIES. %0a%3c %0a%3c THE CHAMELA3A. %0a%3c %0a%3c In the time, too, of our fathers, King Juba discovered 68 a %0a%3c %0a%3c 5 - Identified with the Artemisia camphorata of Linnaeus, Camphorated %0a%3c muff wort. 63 Quite a different plant.

It was these brothers who introduced the %0a%3c practice of douchiilg the body with large quantities of cold %0a%3c water, immediately after the bath, for the purpose of bracing %0a%3c the system : whereas in former times, as we find stated in the %0a%3c works of Homer 60 even, it was the practice to wash the body %0a%3c with warm water only. With reference to euphorbia, 61 there %0a%3c is a treatise still in existence, written upon it by Xing Juba, %0a%3c in which he highly extols its merits : he discovered it growing %0a%3c upon Mount Atlas, and describes it as resembling a thyrsus in %0a%3c appearance, and bearing leaves like those of the acanthus.® %0a%3c %0a%3c The properties of this plant are so remarkably powerful, 0 %0a%3c that the persons engaged in collecting the juices of it are %0a%3c obliged to stand at a considerable distance.

The juice has all the %0a%3c appearance of milk, as it exudes, but when it has coagulated %0a%3c and dried, it assumes the form and consistency of frankincense. %0a%3c The persons engaged in collecting it, find their sight improved 61 %0a%3c thereby. This juice is an excellent remedy for the stings of %0a%3c serpents : in whatever part of the body the wound may have %0a%3c been inflicted, the practice is to make an incision in the crown %0a%3c of the head, and there introduce the medicament.

This plant is found mostly %0a%3c growing in the vicinity of ancient monuments, old walls, and %0a%3c overgrown footpaths: it is an evergreen, and its leaves are %0a%3c like those of nasturtium, with a stem a cubit in height, and a %0a%3c seed so diminutive as to be hardly perceptible ; the root, too, %0a%3c has just the smell of nasturtium. Its properties are more %0a%3c strongly developed in summer, and it is only used fresh- %0a%3c gathered : there is considerable difficulty in pounding it. %0a%3c %0a%3c Mixed with a small proportion of axle-grease, it is extremely %0a%3c useful for sciatica and all diseases of the joints ; the application %0a%3c being kept on some four hours at the utmost, when used by %0a%3c the male sex, and about half that time in the case of females. %0a%3c Immediately after its removal, the patient must take a warm %0a%3c bath, and then anoint the body all over with oil and wine— %0a%3c the same operation being repeated every twenty days, so long %0a%3c as there are any symptoms of pain remaining. A similar %0a%3c method is adopted for the cure of all internal defluxions; it %0a%3c %0a%3c 94 Sprengel and other commentators identify it with the Pulmonaria %0a%3c officinalis of Linnaeus, Lungwort or Pulmonary.

Littre gives as its synonym the Iberis amara of Linnaeus, %0a%3c the White candy-tuft. %0a%3c %0a%3c 98 “ Fictum nomen.” Salmasius thinks that by these words, Pliny %0a%3c means that Democrates invented the name of a friend of his as being the %0a%3c discoverer of this plant, which in reality was discovered by himself. It %0a%3c would seem to mean, however, that the name “ iberis ” was only a fanciful %0a%3c title, derived from the country where it was found, and given to it for want %0a%3c of acquaintance with its real name. %0a%3c %0a%3c 99 Still preserved in Galen, B. x. c. 2. %0a%3c %0a%3c VOL.

It %0a%3c is by the aid of this plant that the swallow restores the sight %0a%3c of the young birds in the nest, and even, as some persons will %0a%3c have it, when the eyes have been plucked out. There are two %0a%3c varieties of this plant; the larger 1 kind has a branchy stem, and %0a%3c a leaf somewhat similar to that of the wild parsnip , 2 * but %0a%3c larger. The plant itself is some two cubits in height, and of %0a%3c a whitish colour, that of the flower being yellow. The smaller* %0a%3c kind has leaves like those of ivy, only rounder and not so %0a%3c white. The juice of it is pungent, and resembles saffron in %0a%3c colour, and the seed is similar to that of the poppy. %0a%3c %0a%3c These plants blossom , 4 both of them, at the arrival of the %0a%3c swallow, and wither at the time of its departure. The juice %0a%3c is extracted while they are in flower, and is boiled gently in a %0a%3c copper vessel on hot ashes, with Attic honey, being esteemed %0a%3c a sovereign remedy for films upon the eyes. This juice is %0a%3c employed also, unmixed with any other substance, for the %0a%3c eyesalves , 5 6 which from it take their name of “ chelidonia.” %0a%3c %0a%3c chap. 51. —the dog-plant: one remedy. %0a%3c %0a%3c Dogs, too, are in the habit of seeking a certain plant , 4 as a %0a%3c stimulant to the appetite; but although they eat it in our %0a%3c presence, it has never yet been discovered what it is, it being %0a%3c quite impossible to recognize it when seen half-chewed. %0a%3c There has also been ■ remarked another bit of spitefulness in %0a%3c this animal, though in a much greater degree, in reference to %0a%3c %0a%3c 1 The Chelidonium majus of Linnaeus, the Greater celandine or swallow- %0a%3c %0a%3c wort. 2 “ Pastinaca erratica.” See c. 64 of this Book. %0a%3c %0a%3c 2 Identified with the Ranunculus ficaria of Linnaeus, the Pilewort, or %0a%3c %0a%3c Lesser celandine. %0a%3c %0a%3c 4 The same is the case, Fee remarks, with numbers of other planta. %0a%3c %0a%3c 6 “Collyriis.” %0a%3c %0a%3c 6 The Dactylos of B. xxiv. c. 119, is supposed to be the plant alluded to. %0a%3c The word “canariam” is found here in former editions, but Sillig omit* %0a%3c it.

This plant grows nowhere 11 but in Crete. The %0a%3c branches of it are remarkably thin; it resembles pennyroyal %0a%3c in appearance, and is hot and acrid to the taste. The leaves %0a%3c are the only part employed, it being destitute of 13 blossom, %0a%3c seed, and stem : the root is thin, and never used. In Crete %0a%3c even, it is found growing only in a very limited locality, and %0a%3c is sought by goats with singular avidity. %0a%3c %0a%3c In place of it, the pseudodictamnum 13 is employed, a plant %0a%3c that is found growing in many countries. In leaf it is similar %0a%3c to the other, but the branches are more diminutive : by some %0a%3c persons it is known as “ chondris.” Its properties not being %0a%3c so strongly developed, the difference is immediately recognized : %0a%3c for an infusion of the very smallest piece of the real dittany, %0a%3c %0a%3c 7 In B. xxii. c. 37. %0a%3c %0a%3c 6 From the Greek iKkoj, “ to draw.” %0a%3c %0a%3c 9 In B. viii. c. 41. %0a%3c %0a%3c 10 The Origanum dictamnus of Linnaeus, Dittany of Candia. %0a%3c %0a%3c 11 This is an error: it grows, and doubtless did in Pliny's time, in %0a%3c numerous other places; but that of Mount Ida in Crete was held in the %0a%3c highest esteem. %0a%3c %0a%3c ! 12 It has all three, in fact; as Fee says, it is evident that Pliny never %0a%3c ;aw it.

Some persons say, that both plants grow indis¬ %0a%3c criminately in numerous localities, the inferior sort being the %0a%3c produce of rich soils, and the genuine dittany being found %0a%3c nowhere but in rugged, uncultivated spots. %0a%3c %0a%3c There is, again, a third 14 plant called “ dictamnum,” which, %0a%3c however, has neither the appearance nor the properties of the %0a%3c other plant so called ; the leaves of it are like those of sisym¬ %0a%3c brium , 15 but the branches are larger. %0a%3c %0a%3c There has long been this impression with reference to Crete, %0a%3c that whatever plant grows there is infinitely superior in its %0a%3c properties to a similar plant the produce of any other country; %0a%3c the second rank being given to the produce of Mount Parnassus, %0a%3c In addition to this, it is generally asserted that simples of ex¬ %0a%3c cellent quality are found upon Mount Pelion in Thessaly, %0a%3c Mount Teleuthrius in Euboea, and throughout the whole of %0a%3c Arcadia and Laconia.

One of these has a root covered with tubercles of %0a%3c a rounded 19 shape, and leaves of a mixed appearance, between %0a%3c those of the mallow and the ivy, only softer and more swarthy. %0a%3c The second 20 kind is the male plant, with an elongated root %0a%3c some four fingers in length, and the thickness of a walking- %0a%3c stick. A third 21 variety is extremely thin and long, similar to %0a%3c a young vine in appearance : it has the most strongly-marked %0a%3c properties of them all, and is known by the additional names %0a%3c of “ clematitis,” and “cretica.” All these plants are the %0a%3c colour of boxwood, have a slender stem, and bear a purple flower %0a%3c and small berries like those of the caper : the root is the only %0a%3c part that is possessed of any virtues. %0a%3c %0a%3c There is also a fourth 22 kind, the name given to which is %0a%3c “ plistolochiait is more slender than the one last mentioned, %0a%3c has a root thickly covered with filaments, and is about as thick %0a%3c as a good-sized bulrush : another name given to it is “polyr- %0a%3c rhizos.” The smell of all these plants is medicinal, but that of %0a%3c the one with an oblong root and a very slender stem, is the most %0a%3c agreeable : this last, in fact, which has a fleshy outer coat, is %0a%3c well adapted as an ingredient for nardine unguents even.

Littre gives the Aristolochia pallida of Willdenow. %0a%3c %0a%3c 20 Most probably the Aristolochia longa of Linnaeus, found in France, %0a%3c Spain, Portugal, and Italy.

The male 43 agaric is firmer than %0a%3c the other, and more bitter; it is productive too of head-ache. %0a%3c The female plant is of a looser texture ; it has a sweet taste at %0a%3c first, which speedily changes into a bitter flavour. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 58. -THE ECHIOS ; THREE VARIETIES OF IT : TWO REMEDIES. %0a%3c %0a%3c Of the echios there are two kinds; one 44 of which resembles %0a%3c pennyroyal in appearance, and has a concave leaf. It is ad¬ %0a%3c ministered, in doses of two drachmae, in four cyathi of wine. %0a%3c The other 45 kind is distinguished by a prickly down, and bears %0a%3c small heads resembling those of vipers : it is usually taken in %0a%3c wine and vinegar. Some persons give the name of “ echios %0a%3c personata” 46 to a kind of echios with larger leaves than the %0a%3c others, and burrs of considerable size, resembling that of the %0a%3c lappa. 47 The root of this plant is boiled and administered in %0a%3c vinegar. %0a%3c %0a%3c ’ !9 It is supposed by commentators that he is in error here, and that this %0a%3c description applies to the Lappa canaria, mentioned in B. xxiv. c. 116. %0a%3c %0a%3c 40 The root of the Papaver argemone has no such smell. %0a%3c %0a%3c 41 See B. xxi. c. 94, B. xxiv. c. 116, and B. xxvi. c. 59. %0a%3c %0a%3c 42 The Boletus agaricum of Aiton, or White agaric.

There %0a%3c are two varieties of it: the one that is thickly covered with %0a%3c leaves 53 is thought to be the female plant; that with fewer %0a%3c leaves, 54 the male. Both kinds have numerous thin branches, %0a%3c a cubit in length, and of an angular form. The leaves are %0a%3c smaller than those of the quercus, and narrower, with larger %0a%3c indentations. The flower is of a grey colour, and the root %0a%3c is long and thin. This plant is to be found growing every¬ %0a%3c where, in level humid localities. Some persons make no %0a%3c distinction between these two varieties, and look upon them as %0a%3c identical, from the circumstance of their being productive of %0a%3c precisely similar effects. %0a%3c %0a%3c The people in the Gallic provinces make use of them both for %0a%3c soothsaying purposes, and for the prediction of future events ; %0a%3c but it is the magicians more particularly that give utterance to %0a%3c such ridiculous follies in reference to this plant. Persons, they %0a%3c tell us, if they rub themselves with it will be sure to gain the %0a%3c object of their desires ; and they assure us that it keeps away %0a%3c fevers, conciliates friendship, and is a cure for every possible %0a%3c disease; they say, too, that it must be gathered about tbe %0a%3c rising of the Dog-star—but so as not to be shone upon by sun %0a%3c or moon—and that honey-combs and honey must be first pre¬ %0a%3c sented to the earth by way of expiation.

The most esteemed kind is that %0a%3c of Crete, 65 the next best being the produce of Achaia, and of %0a%3c all dry localities. It resembles fennel in appearance, only %0a%3c that its leaves are whiter, more diminutive, and hairy on the %0a%3c surface. The stem is upright, and a foot in length, and the root %0a%3c has a remarkably pleasant taste and smell. This kind grows %0a%3c in stony localities with a southern aspect. %0a%3c %0a%3c The inferior sorts are found growing everywhere, upon de¬ %0a%3c clivities for instance, and in the hedges of fields, but always in %0a%3c a rich soil. The leaves are like those of coriander, 68 the stem %0a%3c being a cubit in length, the heads round, often three or more in %0a%3c number, and the root ligneous, and good for nothing when %0a%3c dry. The seed of this kind is like that of cummin, while that %0a%3c of the first kind bears a resemblance to millet; in all cases %0a%3c it is white, acrid, hot, and odoriferous. The seed of the %0a%3c second kind has more active properties than that of the first; %0a%3c for which reason it should be used more sparingly. %0a%3c %0a%3c If it is considered really desirable to recognize a third %0a%3c %0a%3c •a Identified by Fee with the Sparganium ramosum of Linnaeus, or %0a%3c Branchy burr-reed. Littre gives the Butonus umbellatus of Linnaeus, the %0a%3c Flowering rush, or Water gladiole. %0a%3c %0a%3c 61 Fee remarks, that the account given by Pliny has not the same pre¬ %0a%3c cision as that of Dioscorides, who describes three varieties of the Daucus. %0a%3c %0a%3c 64 F%3c$e is inclined to identify the Daucus of Crete and Achaia with the %0a%3c Daucus Creticus of Fuchsius, the Athamanta annua of Linnaeus. Des- %0a%3c fontaines identifies it with the Athamanta Cretensis of Linnaeus. %0a%3c %0a%3c 66 This kind is identified by Fee with the Seseli ammoides of Linnaeus, %0a%3c and hy Littre with the Ammi majus of Linnaeus, the Common or Greater %0a%3c bishop's weed. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 124 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c flint’s natural history. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [ B*ok XXV. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c variety of the daucus, there is a plant 07 of this nature very %0a%3c similar to the staphylinos, known as the “ pastinaca 6 * erratica,” %0a%3c with an oblong seed and a sw r eet root. Quadrupeds will touch %0a%3c none of these plants, either in winter or in summer, except %0a%3c indeed, after abortion. 69 The seed of the various kinds is used, %0a%3c with the exception of that of Crete, in which case it is the %0a%3c root that is employed ; this root being particularly useful for the %0a%3c stings of serpents. The proper dose is one drachma, taken in %0a%3c wine. It is administered also to cattle when stung by those %0a%3c reptiles. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 65. -THE THERIONARCA t TWO REMEDIES. %0a%3c %0a%3c The therionarca, altogether a different plant from that of %0a%3c the Magi, 70 grows in our own climates, and is a branchy plant, %0a%3c with greenish leaves, and a rose-coloured flower.

This plant also is taken, in doses of two %0a%3c denarii, in wine. %0a%3c %0a%3c 67 Identified by Sprengel with the Daucus Mauritanicus, and hy Brotero %0a%3c and Desfontaines with the Daucus carota, var. a, our Common carrot. Fee %0a%3c seems inclined to identify it with the Athamanta cervaria of Linnaeus, %0a%3c Mountain carrot, or Broad-leaved spignel. The account given by Pliny %0a%3c is, however, a mass of confusion. %0a%3c %0a%3c 68 Or “ wild parsnip.” See B. xix. c. 27. %0a%3c %0a%3c 69 For the purpose of expelling the dead foetus, according to Dioscorides, %0a%3c B. iii. c. 83. %0a%3c %0a%3c 10 See B. xxiv. c. 102.

The stem is thin and hollow, the flowers %0a%3c of a purple colour, and the root large and covered with a %0a%3c black rind; so much so, in fact, that it might almost be taken %0a%3c for the root of rape. This plant grows in umbrageous local¬ %0a%3c ities, and by the people of our country is known as the ‘Huber %0a%3c terrae.” 74 It ought to be grown in every house, if there is any %0a%3c truth in the assertion that wherever it grows, noxious spells %0a%3c can have no effect.

The berries are the only part of it in use, being of an %0a%3c %0a%3c n Fee identifies it with the Cvclamen hederasfolium of Aiton, the Ivy- %0a%3c leaved sow-bread ; Littre with the Cyclamen Graecum of Lamarck. %0a%3c %0a%3c ,4 “ Tuberosity of the earth.” . . %0a%3c %0a%3c 15 “ Suum venenum ei est.” Gerard seems to have had a worse opinion %0a%3c of it than our author; for he states in his Herbal, p. 845, that he had ex¬ %0a%3c perienced great misfortunes owing to his imprudence in having cultivated %0a%3c Cyclamen in his garden. %0a%3c %0a%3c 16 «Ivy-flowered.” It resembles the other plant in nothing but the %0a%3c name.

The stem resembles that of %0a%3c fennel, is thin and long, covered with leaves close to the ground, %0a%3c and terminating in athick black juicy root, with apowerful smell. %0a%3c It grows on umbrageous mountains, and is taken up at the end %0a%3c of autumn. The largest and tenderest roots are the most es¬ %0a%3c teemed ; they are cut with bone-knives into slips four fingers %0a%3c in length, and left to shed their juice 79 in the shade ; the persons %0a%3c employed taking the precaution of rubbing the head and nos¬ %0a%3c trils with rose-oil, as a preservative against vertigo. %0a%3c %0a%3c There is also another kind of juice, which adheres to the %0a%3c stems, and exudes from incisions made therein. It is con¬ %0a%3c sidered best when it has arrived at the consistency of honey: %0a%3c the colour of it is red, and it has a strong but agreeable smell, %0a%3c and a hot, acrid taste. This juice, as well as the root and a %0a%3c decoction of it, enters into the composition of numerous medica¬ %0a%3c ments, but the juice has the most powerful properties of %0a%3c the two. Diluted with bitter almonds or rue, it is taken in %0a%3c drink as a remedy for injuries inflicted by serpents.

A third kind, again, is known as the “ lychnitis”* %0a%3c by some persons, and as the “ tliryallis” by others : it has three %0a%3c leaves only, or four at the very utmost, thick and unctuous, %0a%3c and well adapted for making wicks for lamps. The leaves of %0a%3c the phlomos which we have mentioned as the female plant, if %0a%3c wrapped about figs, will preserve them most efficiently from %0a%3c decay, it is said. It seems little better than a loss of time to %0a%3c give the distinguishing characteristics of these three" kinds, %0a%3c the effects of them all being precisely the same. %0a%3c %0a%3c For injuries inflicted by scorpions, an infusion of the root %0a%3c is taken, with rue, in water. Its bitterness is intense, but it %0a%3c is quite as efficacious as the plants already mentioned. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 75. -THE THliLYPHONON OR SCORPIO : ONE REMEDY. %0a%3c %0a%3c The thelyphonon 90 is a plant known as the “scorpio” to some, %0a%3c from the peculiar form of its roots, the very touch of which %0a%3c kills 91 the scorpion: hence it is that it is taken in drink for stings %0a%3c inflicted by those reptiles. If a dead scorpion is rubbed with %0a%3c white hellebore, it will come to life, they say. The thelypho¬ %0a%3c non is fatal to all quadrupeds, on the application of the root to %0a%3c the genitals. The leaf too, which bears a resemblance to that %0a%3c of cyclaminos, is productive of a similar effect, in the course of %0a%3c the same day. It is a jointed plant, and is found growing in %0a%3c unbrageous localities. Juice of betony or of plantago is a %0a%3c preservative against the venom of the scorpion. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 76. -THE PHRYNION, NEURAS, OR POTERION ; ONE %0a%3c %0a%3c REMEDY. %0a%3c %0a%3c Frogs, too, have their venom, the bramble-frog 92 in particular, %0a%3c %0a%3c Sprengel and Desfontaines consider the second kind to be the Phlomis %0a%3c Italica of Smith; on insufficient grounds, Fee thinks.

In other respects, they %0a%3c present the same veined appearance as those of the plantago. %0a%3c This plant has a single stem, slender, a cubit in height, and %0a%3c terminated by a spreading head. 97 The roots of it are nume¬ %0a%3c rous, thin like those of black hellebore, acrid, unctuous, and %0a%3c odoriferous: it is found growing in watery localities. %0a%3c %0a%3c There is another kind also, which grows in the woods, of a %0a%3c more swarthy colour, and with larger leaves. The root of %0a%3c them both is used for injuries inflicted by frogs and by the %0a%3c sea-hare, 98 in doses of one drachma taken in wine. Cycla- %0a%3c minos, too, is an antidote for injuries inflicted by the sea-hare. %0a%3c %0a%3c The bite of the mad dog has certain venomous properties, %0a%3c as an antidote to which we have the cynorrhodos, of which %0a%3c %0a%3c 93 Schneider, on Nicander’s Alexiph. p. 277, says that he cannot under¬ %0a%3c stand this passage. There is little doubt that Sillig is right in his con¬ %0a%3c jecture that it is imperfect, for the pith of the narrative, whatever it may %0a%3c have been, is evidently wanting.

In the number of antidotes to all these artificial %0a%3c poisons as well as to the spells of sorcery, the very first place %0a%3c must be accorded to the moly 3 of Homer; next to which come %0a%3c the mithridatia, 3 scordotis, 4 and centaury. The seed of betony %0a%3c carries off all kinds of noxious substances by stool; being taken %0a%3c for the purpose in honied wine or raisin wine, or else pulverized, %0a%3c and taken, in doses of one drachma, in four cyathi of old wine : %0a%3c in this last case, however, the patient must bring it off the %0a%3c stomach by vomit and then repeat the dose. Persons who %0a%3c accustom themselves to take this plant daily, will never ex¬ %0a%3c perience any injury, they say, from substances of a poisonous %0a%3c nature. %0a%3c %0a%3c When a person has taken poison, one most powerful remedy %0a%3c is aristolochia, 5 taken in the same proportions as those used for %0a%3c injuries inflicted by serpents. 6 The juice, too, of cinquefoil is %0a%3c given for a similar purpose ; and in both cases, after the patient %0a%3c has vomited, agaric is acftninistered, in doses of one denarius, in %0a%3c three cyathi of hydromel. %0a%3c %0a%3c 99 In c. 6 of this Book. %0a%3c %0a%3c 1 “Pigeon-plant.” The same as Vervain, already described in c. 59of %0a%3c this Book.

According to %0a%3c what the magicians say, persons who rub themselves with this %0a%3c plant improve their personal appearance thereby; and they %0a%3c may ensure themselves against all noxious substances and %0a%3c poisons, by wearing it as a bracelet. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 81. —EUCLEA : ONE REMEDY. %0a%3c %0a%3c The same is the case, too, with the plant to which they give %0a%3c the name of “euclea,” 9 and which, they tell us, rubbed upon %0a%3c the person, will ensure a more extended consideration. They %0a%3c say, too, that if a person carries artemisia 10 about him, he will %0a%3c be ensured against all noxious drugs, the attacks of wild beasts %0a%3c of every kind, and sunstroke even.

There are two %0a%3c varieties of it; one with a red I 11 outer coat, and the other, 13 %0a%3c %0a%3c I Generally identified with the Antirrhinum Orontium of Linnaeus, %0a%3c Small toad-flax, Calf’s snout, or Lesser wild snapdragon. Desfontaines %0a%3c mentions the Antirrhinum purpureum, and Littre the A. majus of Lin¬ %0a%3c naeus, the Common snapdragon, or Greater calf’s snout. %0a%3c %0a%3c 8 “Wild lychnis.” %0a%3c %0a%3c 9 Theophrastus says, B. ix. c. 21, speaking of the last-mentioned plant, %0a%3c “ The same too, with reference to glory and consideration.” Pliny, %0a%3c singularly enough, has mistaken the Greek word “eucleia” (glory) for %0a%3c the name of a plant, and has fabricated one accordingly: a similar blunder %0a%3c to that made by him with reference to “ hippace,” in c. 44 of this Book. %0a%3c %0a%3c 10 See c. 36 of this Book. %0a%3c %0a%3c II Fee is inclined to identify it with the Bulbine of B. xx. c. 41, pro¬ %0a%3c bably the Hyacinthus botryoi'des of Linnaeus, the Blue grape hyacinth. %0a%3c Brotero and Desfontaines name the Hyacinthus comosus, the Purple grape %0a%3c hyacinth. Littre mentions the Ornithogalum nutans of Linnaeus, the May %0a%3c star of Bethlehem. %0a%3c %0a%3c 12 Identified by Fee with the Bulbus vomitorius or Bulb emetic of B. xx. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 132 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c pliny’s natural history. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XXV. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c similar in appearance to the black poppy, and possessed of %0a%3c greater virtues than the first.

This %0a%3c last, too, is given in cases of poisoning by fungi. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 83. (11.)- REMEDIES FOR DISEASES OF THE HEAD. %0a%3c %0a%3c NTMPHiEA HERACLIA : TWO REMEDIES. %0a%3c %0a%3c But we shall now proceed to point out the various classes %0a%3c of remedies for the several parts of the body, and the maladies %0a%3c to which those parts are subject, beginning in the first place %0a%3c with the head. %0a%3c %0a%3c The root of nymphsea heraclia 14 effects the cure of alopecy, %0a%3c if they are beaten up together, 15 and applied. The polythrix 4 %0a%3c differs from the callitrichos 17 in having white, rushlike suckers, %0a%3c larger leaves, and more numerous; the main stem, 18 too, is %0a%3c larger. This plant strengthens the hair, prevents it from %0a%3c falling off, and makes it grow more thickly. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 84. -THE LINGULACA : ONE REMEDY. %0a%3c %0a%3c The same is the case too with the lingulaca, 19 a plant that %0a%3c grows in the vicinity of springs, and the root of which is %0a%3c reduced to ashes, and beaten up with hog’s lard. Due care %0a%3c must be taken, however, that it is the lard of a female, of a %0a%3c black colour, and one that has never farrowed. The application %0a%3c is rendered additionally efficacious, if the ointment is applied in %0a%3c the sun. Boot, too, of cyclaminos is employed in the same %0a%3c %0a%3c c. 41, the same, in his opinion, with the Narcissus jonquilla, the Emetic jon¬ %0a%3c quil. Sprengel, however, would identify the Bulbus vomitorius with either %0a%3c the Narcissus orientalis or the Pancratium Illyricum; and Sibthorp con¬ %0a%3c siders its synonym to be the Ornithogalum stachyoides of Aiton. Littre %0a%3c gives the Muscari comosum. %0a%3c %0a%3c 13 See c. 13 of this Book. %0a%3c %0a%3c 14 See c. 37 of this Book, and B. xxvi. c. 28. %0a%3c %0a%3c 15 There seems to be an hiatus here. From the words of Dioscorides, %0a%3c B. iii. c. 138, it would appear that pitch was the other ingredient, to be %0a%3c beaten up with the plant. %0a%3c %0a%3c 16 The same as the Polytrichos of B. xxii. c. 30. %0a%3c %0a%3c 17 In B. xxii. c. 30, he makes them to be the same plant, and it is moft %0a%3c %0a%3c probable that they may be both referred to the Asplenium trichomanes of %0a%3c Linnaeus. 18 “ Frutice.” %0a%3c %0a%3c ■ 19 See B. xxiv. c. 108. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 87.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c HYSSOP. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 133 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c manner for a similar purpose. A decoction of root of helle¬ %0a%3c bore in oil or in water is used for the removal of porrigo. For %0a%3c the cure of head-ache, root of all kinds of panaces 20 is used, %0a%3c beaten up in oil; as also aristolochia 21 and iberis, 22 this last being %0a%3c applied to the head for an hour or more, if the patient can %0a%3c bear it bo long, care being taken to bathe in the meanwhile. %0a%3c The daucus, too, is curative of head-ache. Cyclaminos, 23 intro¬ %0a%3c duced into the nostrils with honey, clears the head; used in %0a%3c the form of a liniment, it heals ulcers of the head. Periste- %0a%3c reos, 21 also, is curative of diseases of the head. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 85. -THE CACALIA OR LEONTICK : THREE REMEDIES. %0a%3c %0a%3c The name of “ cacalia” 25 or “ leontice” is given to a plant %0a%3c with seed resembling small pearls in appearance, and hang¬ %0a%3c ing down between large leaves: it is mostly found upon %0a%3c mountains. Fifteen grains of this seed are macerated in oil, %0a%3c and the head is rubbed with the mixture, the contrary way to %0a%3c the hair. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 86.-THE CALL1TRICH0S '. ONE REMEDY. %0a%3c %0a%3c A sternutatory, too, is prepared from the callitrichos. 25 The %0a%3c leaves of this plant are similar to those of the lentil, and the %0a%3c stems resemble fine rushes ; the root is very diminutive. It %0a%3c grows in 6hady, moist localities, and has a burning taste in the %0a%3c mouth. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 87. -HYSSOP : TEN REMEDIES. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hyssop, 27 beaten up in oil, is curative of phthiriasis and %0a%3c %0a%3c *° See c. II of this Book. %0a%3c %0a%3c 21 See c. 54 of this Book. 22 See c. 49 of this Book. %0a%3c %0a%3c 23 See e. 67 of this Book. 21 Or Vervain. %0a%3c %0a%3c 25 Sprengel identified this plant at first with the Buplevrum longifolium %0a%3c of Linnaeus, the Long-leaved hare’s ear, but at a later period with the %0a%3c Mercurialis tomentosa, the Woolly mercury. Fee .suggests the Cacalia %0a%3c petasites or albifrons, though with diffidence. Littre gives the Cacalia ver- %0a%3c Dascifolia of Sibthorp. %0a%3c %0a%3c 26 See c. 83 of this Book ; also B. xxii. c. 30, and B. xxvii. c. 111. %0a%3c %0a%3c 27 There has been much discussion on the identification of the Hyssopum %0a%3c of the ancients, their descriptions varying very considerably. It has been %0a%3c suggested that that of the Egyptians was the Origanum JBgyptianum; that %0a%3c of the Hebrews, the Origanum Syriacum ; that of Dioscorides, the Origa¬ %0a%3c num Smyrnamm; and that of the other Greek writers, the Teucrium pseudo- %0a%3c hyssopus, or else the Thymbra verticillata and spicata. Fee is inclined to %0a%3c identify that here mentioned by Pliny with the Thymbra spicata of Lin¬ %0a%3c naeus, and the Garden hyssop of Dioscorides, with the Hyssopus officinalis %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 134 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c flint’s natubal, histoby. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XXV. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c prurigo of the head. The be3t hyssop is that of Mount %0a%3c Taurus in Cilicia, next to which in quality is the produce of %0a%3c Pamphylia and Smyrna. This plant is injurious to the %0a%3c stomach: taken with figs, it produces alvine evacuations, and %0a%3c used in combination with honey, it acts as an emetic. It is %0a%3c generally thought that, beaten up with honey, salt, and cum¬ %0a%3c min, it is curative of the stings of serpents. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 88.-THE LONCHITIS : FOUK REMEDIES. %0a%3c %0a%3c The lonchitis 29 is not, as most writers have imagined, the %0a%3c same plant as the xiphion 30 or phasganion, although the seed %0a%3c of it does bear a resemblance to the point of a spear. The %0a%3c lonchitis, in fact, has leaves like those of the leek, of a red¬ %0a%3c dish colour near the root, and more numerous there than on the %0a%3c upper part of the stem. It bears diminutive heads, which are %0a%3c very similar to our masks of comedy, and from which a small %0a%3c tongue protrudes : 31 the roots of it are remarkably long. It %0a%3c grows in thirsty, arid soils. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 89. -THE XIPHION OB PHASGANION: FOUR BEMEDIES. %0a%3c %0a%3c The xiphion 32 or phasganion, on the other hand, is found %0a%3c growing in humid localities. On first leaving the ground it %0a%3c has the appearance of a sword ; the stem of it is two cubits in %0a%3c length, and the root is fringed like a hazel nut. 33 %0a%3c %0a%3c This root should always be taken up before harvest, and %0a%3c dried in the shade. The upper part of it, pounded with %0a%3c frankincense, and mixed with an equal quantity of wine, ex¬ %0a%3c tracts fractured bones of the cranium, purulent matter in all %0a%3c parts of the body, and bones of serpents, 34 when accidentally %0a%3c %0a%3c of Linnaeus. Littre states, however, that this last is a stranger to Greece, %0a%3c and that M. Fraas ( Synopsis , p. 182) identifies the hyssop of Dioscorides %0a%3c with the Origanum Smyrnaeum or Syriaeum. %0a%3c %0a%3c 29 Generally identified with the Serapias lingua of Linnaeus. %0a%3c %0a%3c 30 The same, most probably, as the Gladiolus of B. xxi. c. 67. See also %0a%3c the next Chapter in this Book. %0a%3c %0a%3c 31 This was a characteristic feature of the masks used in the Roman %0a%3c Comedy. %0a%3c %0a%3c 32 See Note 30 above. The medicinal properties here attributed to the %0a%3c Xiphion, or Gladiolus communis, our common Red corn-flag, are very doubt¬ %0a%3c ful, as Fee remarks. %0a%3c %0a%3c 33 With the outer coat on, of course. %0a%3c %0a%3c 31 Dalechamps is probably right in preferring the reading “carpentis” %0a%3c to “ serpentis,” in which case the meaning would be, “ or bones when %0a%3c accidentally crushed by the wheels of vehicles.” %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 90.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c PSYLLIOX. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 135 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c trodden upon ; it is very efficacious, too, for poisons.

The seed of it is %0a%3c the part made use of; for head-ache, it is applied to the fore¬ %0a%3c head and temples with rose oil and vinegar, or else with %0a%3c oxycrate; it is used as a liniment for other purposes also. %0a%3c Mixed in the proportion of one acetabulum to one sextarius of %0a%3c water, it is left to coagulate and thicken; after which it is %0a%3c beaten up, and the thick solution is used as a liniment for all %0a%3c kinds of pains, abscesses, and inflammations. %0a%3c %0a%3c Aristolochia is used as a remedy for wounds in the head; it %0a%3c has the property, too, of extracting fractured bones, not only %0a%3c from other parts of the body, but the cranium in particular-. %0a%3c The same, too, with plistolochia. %0a%3c %0a%3c Thryselinum 39 is a plant not unlike parsley; the root of it, %0a%3c eaten, carries off pituitous humours from the head. %0a%3c %0a%3c 34 Or “ meagrim.” %0a%3c %0a%3c 36 Identified with the Plantago Psyllium of Linnaeus, our Fleawort, %0a%3c Fleaseed, or Fleabane. %0a%3c %0a%3c 37 Nothing, Fee says, can be more absurd than this description of the %0a%3c %0a%3c plant. , %0a%3c %0a%3c 38 Whence its name “ cynoides ” and “ cynomyia.” %0a%3c %0a%3c 59 This plant has not been identified; Wild’ water-parsley, perhaps a kind %0a%3c of Sium, has been suggested. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 136 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c pliny’s natural history. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XXV. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 91 .

It is thought also that sideritis is curative of %0a%3c albugo in beasts of burden. As to chelidonia , 41 it is marvel¬ %0a%3c lously good for all the affections above mentioned. Root of %0a%3c panaces 42 is applied, with polenta , 43 to defluxions of the eyes; %0a%3c and for the purpose of keeping them down, henbane-seed is %0a%3c taken, in doses of one obolus, with an equal proportion of %0a%3c opium, in wine. Juice, too, of gentian is used as a lini¬ %0a%3c ment, and it sometimes forms an ingredient in the more ac¬ %0a%3c tive eyesalves , 44 as a substitute for meconium. Euphorbia, w %0a%3c applied in the form of a liniment, improves the eyesight, %0a%3c and for ophthalmia juice of plantago 46 is injected into the %0a%3c eyes. %0a%3c %0a%3c Aristolochia disperses films upon the eyes; and iberis , 47 %0a%3c attached to the head with cinquefoil, is curative of defluxions %0a%3c and other diseases of the eyes. Yerbascum 48 is applied topi¬ %0a%3c cally to defluxions of the eyes, and vervain is used for a %0a%3c similar purpose, with rose oil and vinegar. For the treat¬ %0a%3c ment of cataract and dimness of sight, cyclaminos is reduced %0a%3c to a pulp and divided into lozenges. Juice, too, of peu- %0a%3c cedanum, as already mentioned , 49 mixed with meconium and oil %0a%3c of roses, is good for the sight, and disperses films upon the %0a%3c eyes. Psyllion , 60 applied to the forehead, arrests defluxions of %0a%3c the eyes. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 92 .

There are %0a%3c %0a%3c 40 All the plants here mentioned are of a more or less irritating nature, %0a%3c and would greatly imperil the sight. %0a%3c %0a%3c 41 See c. 50 of this Book. 42 See c. 11 of this Book. %0a%3c %0a%3c 45 See B. xviii. c. 14, and B. xxii. c. 59. 44 “Collyriis.” %0a%3c %0a%3c 45 A most dangerous application, in reality. %0a%3c %0a%3c 4S A comparatively harmless, though useless application. %0a%3c %0a%3c 47 See c. 49 of this Book. 48 See c. 73 of this Book. %0a%3c %0a%3c 49 In c. 70 of this Book. 30 See c. 90 of this Book. %0a%3c %0a%3c 51 The Corchorus of B. xxi. c. 106, is most probably altogether a differ¬ %0a%3c ent plant. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Cbap. 92.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c THE AXAGALLTS. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 137 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c two kinds of it, the male 52 plant, with a red blossom, and the %0a%3c female , 63 with a blue flower. These plants do not exceed a %0a%3c palm in height, and have a tender stem, with diminutive %0a%3c leaves of a rounded form, drooping upon the ground. They %0a%3c grow in gardens and in spots covered with water, the blue %0a%3c anagallis being the first to blossom. The juice 54 of either %0a%3c plant, applied with honey, disperses films upon the eyes, %0a%3c suffusions of blood 55 in those organs resulting from blows, and %0a%3c argema 56 with a red tinge: if used in combination with Attic %0a%3c honey, they are still more efficacious. The anagallis has the %0a%3c effect also of dilating 57 the pupil; hence the eye is anointed %0a%3c with it before the operation of couching 58 for cataract. These %0a%3c plants are employed also for diseases of the eyes in beasts of %0a%3c burden. %0a%3c %0a%3c The juice, injected into the nostrils, which are then rinsed %0a%3c with wine, acts as a detergent upon the head : it is taken also, %0a%3c in doses of one drachma, in wine, for wounds inflicted by ser¬ %0a%3c pents. It is a remarkable fact, that cattle will refuse to touch %0a%3c the female plant; but if it should so happen that, deceived by %0a%3c the resemblance—the flower being the only distinguishing %0a%3c mark—they have accidentally tasted it, they immediately have %0a%3c recourse, as a remedy, to the plant called “ asyla,” 59 but more %0a%3c generally known among us as “ ferus oculus .” 60 Some persons %0a%3c recommend those who gather it, to prelude by saluting it %0a%3c before sunrise, and then, before uttering another word, to take %0a%3c care and extract the juice immediately; if this is done, they %0a%3c say, it will be doubly efficacious. %0a%3c %0a%3c As to the juice of euphorbia, we have spoken 61 of its pro¬ %0a%3c perties at sufficient length already. In cases of ophthalmia, %0a%3c %0a%3c 83 Identified with the Anagallis arvensis of Linnaeus, with a red flower, %0a%3c the Red pimpernel, Corn pimpernel, or Shepherd’s weather-glass. %0a%3c %0a%3c 68 The Anagallis caeruleo flore of Tournefort, the Blue pimpernel. %0a%3c %0a%3c 51 In reality they are destitute of medicinal properties.

The seed is %0a%3c pounded for the purpose, and applied with meal; or else the %0a%3c juice is extracted from the stem and more pulpy leaves, the %0a%3c ears being first removed. This juice is incorporated with meal %0a%3c of three-month wheat, and divided into lozenges. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 94 . —MANDRAGORA, CIRC.EON, MORION, OR HIPPOPHLOMOSJ %0a%3c TWO VARIETIES OF IT : TWENTY-FOUR REMEDIES. %0a%3c %0a%3c Some persons, too, were in the habit of employing mandra- %0a%3c gora for diseases of the eyes; but more recently, the use of it %0a%3c for such a purpose has been abandoned. It is a well-ascertained %0a%3c fact, however, that the root, beaten up with rose oil and %0a%3c wine, is curative of defluxions of the eyes and pains in those %0a%3c organs; and, indeed, the juice of this plant still forms an in¬ %0a%3c gredient in many medicaments for the eyes. Some persons %0a%3c give it the name of “ circaeon .” 63 There are two varieties, %0a%3c the white 64 mandragora, which is generally thought to be the %0a%3c male plant, and the black , 65 which is considered to be the %0a%3c female. It has a leaf narrower than that of the lettuce, a %0a%3c hairy stem, and a double or triple root, black without and %0a%3c white within, soft and fleshy, and nearly a cubit in length. %0a%3c %0a%3c Both kinds bear a fruit about the size of a hazel-nut, %0a%3c enclosing a seed resembling the pips of a pear in appearance. %0a%3c The name given to the white plant by some persons is %0a%3c “arsen ,” 66 by others “morion ,” 67 and by others again, “hippo- %0a%3c phlomos.” The leaves of it are white, while those of the other %0a%3c %0a%3c 62 See B. xviii. c. 44, and B. xxi. c. 63. %0a%3c %0a%3c 63 Or “ Plant of Circe.” %0a%3c %0a%3c 64 Identified by Fee with the Atropa mandragora vemalis of Bertolini, %0a%3c the Spring mandrake. %0a%3c %0a%3c 65 The Atropa mandragora autumnalis of Bertolini, the Autumnal man¬ %0a%3c drake. 66 The Greek for “ male.” %0a%3c %0a%3c 67 “Dementing.” Fee remarks that the “Morion” in reality is a %0a%3c different plant, and queries whether it may not be the Atropa bella¬ %0a%3c donna of Linnaeus, the Belladonna, or Deadly nightshade, mentioned above %0a%3c in Note 57. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 04.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c MAXDBAGOItA. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 139 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c one 68 are broader, and similar to those of garden lapathum 69 in %0a%3c Appearance. Persons, when about to gather this plant, take %0a%3c fevery precaution not to have the wind blowing in their face ; %0a%3c and, after tracing three circles round it with a sword, turn %0a%3c towards the west and dig it up . 10 The juice is extracted both %0a%3c from the fruit and from the stalk, the top being first removed; %0a%3c also from the root, which is punctured for the purpose, or else %0a%3c a decoction is made of it. The filaments, too, of the root are %0a%3c made use of, and it is sometimes cut up into segments and %0a%3c kept in wine. • %0a%3c %0a%3c It is not the mandragora of every country that will yield a %0a%3c juice, but where it does, it is about vintage time that it is %0a%3c collected : it has in all cases a powerful odour, that of the %0a%3c root and fruit the most so. The fruit is gathered when ripe, %0a%3c and dried in the shade; and the juice, when extracted, is left %0a%3c to thicken in the sun. The same is the case, too, with the %0a%3c juice of the root, which is extracted either by pounding it or %0a%3c by boiling it down to one third in red wine. The leaves %0a%3c are best, kept in brine ; indeed, when fresh, the juice of them %0a%3c is a baneful poison ,' 1 and these noxious properties are far from %0a%3c being entirely removed, even when they are preserved in %0a%3c brine. The very odour of them is highly oppressive to the %0a%3c head, although there are countries in which the fruit is eaten. %0a%3c Persons ignorant of its properties are apt to be struck dumb %0a%3c by the odour of this plant when in excess, and too strong a %0a%3c dose of the juice is productive of fatal effects. %0a%3c %0a%3c Administered in doses proportioned to the strength of the %0a%3c patient, this juice has a narcotic effect; a middling dose being %0a%3c one cyathus. It is given, too, for injuries inflicted by serpents, %0a%3c and before incisions or punctures are made in the body, in %0a%3c %0a%3c 68 The female, or black, mandrake. %0a%3c %0a%3c 69 See B. xx. c. 85. . %0a%3c %0a%3c 70 The superstitions with reference to the Mandrake extended from the %0a%3c earliest times till a very recent period. It was used in philtres, and was %0a%3c supposed to utter piercing cries when taken up ; Josephus counsels those %0a%3c whose business it is to do so, to employ a dog for the purpose, if they would %0a%3c avoid dreadful misfortunes. All these notions probably arose from the re¬ %0a%3c semblance which the root bears to the legs and lower part of the human %0a%3c body. See B. xxii. c. 9, where we have queried in a Note whether the %0a%3c Eryngium may not have been the “ mandrake,” the possession of which %0a%3c was so much coveted by the wives of Jacob. %0a%3c %0a%3c 71 “ Pestis est.” %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 140 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c plikt’s natural history. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [BooUXY. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c order to ensure insensibility to the pain .' 2 Indeed, for this last %0a%3c purpose, with some persons, the odour of it is quite sufficient %0a%3c to induce sleep. The juice is taken also as a substitute for %0a%3c hellebore, in doses of two obeli, in honied wine: hellebore, %0a%3c however, is more efficacious as an emetic, and as an evacuant %0a%3c of black bile. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 95.- HEMLOCK 1 THIRTEEN REMEDIES. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hemlock , 73 too, is a poisonous plant, rendered odious by the %0a%3c use made of it by the Athenian people, as an instrument of %0a%3c capital punishment: still , 71 however, as it is employed for %0a%3c many useful purposes, it must not be omitted. It is the seed %0a%3c that is noxious, the stalk being eaten by many people, either %0a%3c green, or cooked 75 in the saucepan. This stem is smooth, %0a%3c jointed like a reed, of a swarthy hue, often as much as two %0a%3c cubits in height, and branchy at the top. The leaves are like %0a%3c those of coriander, only softer, and possessed of a powerful %0a%3c odour. The seed is more substantial than that of anise, and %0a%3c the root is hollow and never used. The seed and leaves are %0a%3c possessed of refrigerating properties; indeed, it is owing to %0a%3c these properties that it is so fatal, the cold chills with which it %0a%3c is attended commencing at the extremities. The great remedy 1 %0a%3c for it, provided it has not reached the vitals, is wine, which is %0a%3c naturally of a warming tendency ; but if it is taken in wine, %0a%3c it is irremediably fatal. %0a%3c %0a%3c A juice is extracted from the leaves and flowers; for it is %0a%3c at the time of its blossoming that it is in its full vigour. The %0a%3c seed is crushed, and the juice extracted from it is left to %0a%3c thicken in the sun, and then divided into lozenges.

Socrates, Phocion, and Philopoemen, are said to have been %0a%3c poisoned with hemlock ; but in the case of Socrates, it was probably com¬ %0a%3c bined with opium and other narcotics.

It is sometimes used in combination with water as a me¬ %0a%3c dium for diluting certain medicaments. An emollient poultice %0a%3c is also prepared from this juice, for the purpose of cooling the %0a%3c stomach ; but the principal use made of it is as a topical ap¬ %0a%3c plication, to check defluxions of the eyes in summer, and to %0a%3c allay pains in those organs. It is employed also as an ingre¬ %0a%3c dient in eyesalves, and is used for arresting fluxes in other parts %0a%3c of the body: the leaves, too, have a soothing effect upon all %0a%3c kinds of pains and tumours, and upon defluxions of the eyes. %0a%3c %0a%3c Anaxilaiis makes a statement to the effect, that if the %0a%3c mamillae 77 are rubbed with hemlock during virginity, they will %0a%3c always be hard and firm : but a better-ascertained fact is, that %0a%3c applied 78 to the mamillae, it dries up the milk in women re¬ %0a%3c cently delivered; as also that, applied to the testes at the age %0a%3c of puberty, it acts most effectually as an antaphrodisiac. 79 As %0a%3c to those cases in which it is recommended to take it internally %0a%3c as a remedy, I shall, for my own part, decline to mention them. %0a%3c The most powerful hemlock is that grown at Susa, in Parthia, %0a%3c the next best being the produce of Laconia, Crete, and Asia. 80 %0a%3c In Greece, the hemlock of the finest quality is that of Megara, %0a%3c and next to it, that of Attica. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 96 . -CRETHMOS AGRIOS : ONE REMEDY. %0a%3c %0a%3c Crethmos agrios, 81 applied to the eyes, removes rheum; and, %0a%3c with the addition of polenta, it causes tumours to disappear. %0a%3c %0a%3c chap. 97 . —molybd^ena: one remedy. %0a%3c %0a%3c Molybdoena 82 also grows everywhere in the fields, a plant %0a%3c commonly known as “ plumbago.” 82 It has leaves like those of %0a%3c lapathum, 83 and a thick, hairy root.

It is used in a %0a%3c green state, and the juice of it disperses films upon the eyes; %0a%3c hence it is that it is employed as an ingredient in medicinal %0a%3c compositions for the eyes. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 99 .- THE ARBORESCENT CAPNOS: THREE REMEDIE8. %0a%3c %0a%3c There is another kind 87 of capnos also, similar both in name %0a%3c and properties, but different in appearance. It is a branchy %0a%3c plant, is extremely delicate, has leaves like those of coriander, %0a%3c is of an ashy colour, and bears a purple flower: it grows in %0a%3c gardens, and amid crops of barley. Employed in the form of %0a%3c an ointment for the eyes, it improves the sight, producing %0a%3c tears in the same way that smoke does, to which, in fact, it %0a%3c owes its name.

All these %0a%3c plants have the same properties, being cooling and astringent. %0a%3c The leaves, applied topically, or the juice, in form of a lini¬ %0a%3c ment, are curative of defluxions of the eyes: this juice too %0a%3c acts as a detergent upon ulcers of the eyes, makes new flesh, %0a%3c and causes them to cicatrize; it 3 cleanses the eyelids also of %0a%3c viscous matter. Applied to the temples, both the leaves %0a%3c and the juice of these plants are remedial for head-ache ; they %0a%3c neutralize the venom also of the phalangium ; and the greater %0a%3c aizoiim, in particular, is an antidote to aconite. It is asserted, %0a%3c too, that those who carry this last plant about them will never %0a%3c be stung by the scorpion. %0a%3c %0a%3c These plants are curative of pains in the ears; which %0a%3c is the case also with juice of henbane, applied in moderate %0a%3c quantities, of achillea, 4 of the smaller centaury and plantago, %0a%3c ofpeucedanum in combination with rose-oil and opium, and of %0a%3c acoron 6 mixed, with rose-leaves.

The %0a%3c leaves, too, are said to be useful for the gums, when swollen %0a%3c with sanious blood, or if there are discharges of blood there¬ %0a%3c from. The seed, too, of plantago is a cure for abscesses in the %0a%3c gums, and for gum-boils. Aristolochia has a strengthening %0a%3c effect upon the gums and teeth ; and the same with vervain, %0a%3c either chewed with the root of that plant, or boiled in wine %0a%3c and vinegar, the decoction being employed as a gargle.

This %0a%3c plant has just the appearance and softness of trixago, 16 with a %0a%3c number of small reddish-coloured stems: it is found growing %0a%3c upon walls, and the tiled roofs of houses.

The head is divided into numerous downy filaments, %0a%3c which resemble those of the thorn, 18 protruding from between %0a%3c the divisions of the head: hence it is that Callimachus has %0a%3c given it the name of “ acanthis,” 19 while others, again, call it %0a%3c “ pappus. 20 ” %0a%3c %0a%3c After all, however, the Greek writers are by no means agreed %0a%3c as to this plant; some say, for instance, that it has leaves %0a%3c like those of rocket, while others maintain that they resemble %0a%3c those of the robur, only that they are considerably smaller. %0a%3c Some, again, assert that the root is useless, while others aver %0a%3c that it is beneficial for the sinews, and others that it produces %0a%3c suffocation, if taken in drink. On the other hand, some have %0a%3c prescribed it in wine, for jaundice and all affections of the %0a%3c bladder, heart, and liver, and give it as their opinion that it %0a%3c carries off gravel from the kidneys. It has been prescribed, %0a%3c also, by them for sciatica, the patient taking one drachma %0a%3c in oxymel, after a walk; and has been recommended as ex¬ %0a%3c tremely useful for griping pains in the bowels, taken in raisin %0a%3c wine. They assert, also, that used as an aliment with vinegar, %0a%3c it is wholesome for the thoracic organs, and recommend it to %0a%3c be grown in the garden for these several purposes. %0a%3c %0a%3c In addition to this, there are some authorities to be found, %0a%3c which distinguish another variety of this plant, but without %0a%3c mentioning its peculiar characteristics. This last they recom¬ %0a%3c mend to be taken in water, to neutralize the venom of serpents, %0a%3c and prescribe it to be eaten for the cure of epilepsy. For my %0a%3c own part, however, I shall only speak of it in accordance with %0a%3c the uses made of it among us Romans, uses based upon the %0a%3c results of actual experience. The down of this plant, beaten %0a%3c up with saffron and a little cold water, is applied to defluxions %0a%3c of the eyes; parched with a little salt, it is employed for the %0a%3c cure of scrofulous sores. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 107 . —THE EPHEMERON : TWO REMEDIES. %0a%3c %0a%3c The ephemeron 21 has leaves like those of the lily, but smaller; %0a%3c %0a%3c 11 “Eapi yipiov, “aged,” or “hoary in spring.” „ %0a%3c %0a%3c 19 “ Spinae.” He probably uses a wrong term, and means “ thistle.” %0a%3c %0a%3c 19 It may possibly have been so called from the Acanthis, or goldfinch, %0a%3c that bird being fond of groundsel. %0a%3c %0a%3c 20 “Thistle-down.” If Pliny is speaking of groundsel, he is wrong in %0a%3c his assertion that it turns white, or in other words, goes to seed, in spring. %0a%3c %0a%3c 21 Sprengel identifies it with the Ornithogalum stachyoides; but that %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 148 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c pliny’s natural history. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XXY. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c a stem of the same height, a blue flower, and a seed of which %0a%3c no use is made.

Fee suggests the Convallaria verti- %0a%3c cillata of Linnaeus, the whorl-leaved Solomon’s seal; as to which, however, %0a%3c there is the same difficulty in reference to the flower. Holland calls it the %0a%3c “May lily,” otherwise the Lily of the valley, the Convallaria Maialis; %0a%3c and this is the synonym suggested by Fuchsius. Littre gives the Conval¬ %0a%3c laria multiflora of Linnaeus. 22 See c. 50 of this Book. %0a%3c %0a%3c 23 Or “Venus’ bath.” Identified by Littre with the Dipsacus silvestris %0a%3c of Linnaeus, and by Fee with the Dipsacus fullonum of Linnaeus, the %0a%3c Teazel, or Fuller’s thistle. It received its Roman name from the form of %0a%3c the leaves, which are channelled, and curved at the edo-es. %0a%3c %0a%3c 24 This is entirely erroneous ; he may possibly have°mistranslated some %0a%3c author, who has stated that the rain-water settles in reservoirs formed by %0a%3c the leaves. %0a%3c %0a%3c 25 He alludes to the larvae of the Curculio or weevil, which are found %0a%3c %0a%3c in the head of the Dipsacus, and many other plants.

The second 29 kind is %0a%3c more foliated than the preceding one, the leaves have more %0a%3c numerous incisions, and the stems of the plant are long. The %0a%3c third 30 variety is smaller than the others, has a powerful smell, %0a%3c and a flower of a golden colour. The fourth 31 kind is very like %0a%3c the one last mentioned, but the flower is milk-white. %0a%3c %0a%3c All these plants have caustic properties: if the leaves are %0a%3c applied unboiled, they raise blisters like those caused by the %0a%3c action of fire ; hence it is that they are used for the removal of %0a%3c leprous spots, itch-scabs, and brand marks upon the skin. %0a%3c They form an ingredient also in all caustic preparations, and %0a%3c are applied for the cure of alopccy, care being taken to remove %0a%3c them very speedily. The root, if chewed for some time, in %0a%3c cases of tooth-ache, will cause 33 the teeth to break; dried and %0a%3c pulverized, it acts as a sternutatory. %0a%3c %0a%3c Our herbalists give this plant the name of “ strumus,” from %0a%3c the circumstance of its being curative of strumous 33 sores and %0a%3c inflamed tumours, for which purpose a portion of it is hung %0a%3c up in the smoke. It is a general belief, too, with them, that if %0a%3c it is replanted, the malady so cured will reappear 34 —a criminal %0a%3c practice, for which the plantago is also employed. The juice %0a%3c of this last-mentioned plant is curative of internal ulcerations %0a%3c of the mouth; and the leaves and root are chewed for a similar %0a%3c %0a%3c 25 Identified by Dcsfontaines with the Ranunculus hirsutus, or philonotis. %0a%3c File, with Hardouin, considers it to be the same as the Apiastrum of B. %0a%3c xx. c. 45, and identifies it with the Ranunculus Sardoiis of Crantz, the %0a%3c plant probably which produces a contraction of the mouth, rendered famous %0a%3c as the “ Sardonic grin,” and more commonly known as the Ranunculus %0a%3c sceleratus, Apiuui risus, or Apium Sardoiim, “Laughing parsley,’ or %0a%3c “Sardinian parsley.' %0a%3c %0a%3c 30 Identified by Sprengel and Dcsfontaines with the Ranunculus repens, %0a%3c or Creeping crow-foot; but by Fee, with the Ranunculus muricatus of %0a%3c Linnaeus. %0a%3c %0a%3c 31 Identified by Desfontaines with the Ranunculus aconitifolius; by Fee %0a%3c with the Ranunculus aquatilis of Linnaeus, the Water crowfoot.
