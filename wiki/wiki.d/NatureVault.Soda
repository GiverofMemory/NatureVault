csum= !!!!Squozen update  I got a lot of feedback online about that recipe and most of it was from people that didn't quite understand what was going on. A lot of people sort of expect that the cocaine that's in coca-cola or was in coca-cola at that time was put in by some guy, you know pour in a bag of white powdery purified cocaine. Which wasn't the case they were using an extract of the coca leaf. But it wasn't pure cocaine it was sort of a mix between the botanical bittering compounds and the alkaloids but not pure cocaine.  So thank you everybody for pointing out that I didn't use cocaine I didn't use cocaine because it's not in the recipe.   The second group of people were all about the Kola nut, and by that point in the recipe Kola nut wasn't used in coca-cola he just wanted straight caffeine didn't want the flavour, he only wanted to hit the caffeine so he was using citrate of caffeine which is pure caffeine.  So now I've got that out of the way we're gonna move on and we're gonna start playing with some of the things that we've found out when we made that recipe and we're going to start honing it in and we're going to turn it into Squozen Cola

In the end, even with compromises, the flavour profile of the Coke recipes is so complex that minor variations are hard to detect.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Merchandise 7x Flavour [Use 2 oz flavour (below) to 5 gals syrup (I used 15mL per 19L, or 1.3mL / 1L)]%0a%3c #236 mL (8 oz) high proof food grade alcohol %0a%3c #20 drops (0.5g / 1 mL) Orange Oil %0a%3c #30 drops (0.75g / 1.5 mL) Lemon Oil %0a%3c #10 drops (0.25g / .5 mL) Nutmeg Oil %0a%3c #5 drops (0.125g / .25 mL) Coriander Oil %0a%3c #10 drops (0.25g / .5 mL) Neroli Oil (You can sub Bitter Orange Oil)%0a%3c #10 drops (0.25g / .5 mL) Cinnamon (Cassia Or True Cinnamon) Oil %0a%3c %0a%3c Original Sugar Syrup Recipe:%0a%3c #FE Coca (Fluid Extract of Coca) 3 drams USP (10.5 mL) %0a%3c #Citric Acid 3 oz (85g)%0a%3c #Caffeine 1 oz (30 mL) %0a%3c #Sugar 30 #%0a%3c #Water 2.5 gal%0a%3c #Lime Juice 2 pints (473 mL) %0a%3c #Vanilla 1 oz (30 mL) %0a%3c #Caramel 1.5 oz or more to colour%0a%3c %0a%3c I made 1/8 Original and re-ordered the ingredients to order of use:%0a%3c #Water 1.18L%0a%3c #Sugar 1.7 Kg%0a%3c #Caramel 5.5 mL%0a%3c #FE Coca 1.3 mL (not used)%0a%3c #Vanilla 3.75 mL%0a%3c #Caffeine 3.75 mL%0a%3c #Lime Juice 59.12 mL %0a%3c #Citric Acid 10.6g%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Method:%0a%3c #Mix together all of the ingredients of the 7X Flavour.%0a%3c #Set this aside in a sealed bottle.%0a%3c #Heat the water sugar and caramel in a large pot.%0a%3c #Stirring continuously, just until sugar is dissolved.%0a%3c #Take off the heat and mix in vanilla, caffeine, lime juice and citric acid.%0a%3c #Stir to fully combine.%0a%3c #Add a measured amount of 7X flavouring to the sugar syrup.%0a%3c %0a%3c Mix with carbonated water at a ratio of one part syrup and 5 parts water.%0a%3c %0a%3c Here are the links to the original This American Life story:%0a%3c https://www.thisamericanlife.org/427/...%0a%3c https://www.thisamericanlife.org/extr...%0a%3c https://www.thisamericanlife.org/extr...%0a%3c https://www.thisamericanlife.org/427/...%0a%3c https://www.thisamericanlife.org/extr...%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Whole Cola Playlist:\\%0a%3c 1) We Made 1886 Coca Cola Recipe: https://youtu.be/IWYuPE8rkeE\\%0a%3c 2) Making Squozen Cola Recipe: https://youtu.be/utvx01Z6JzY\\%0a%3c 3) How We Carbonate Our Soda Water: https://youtu.be/9vRaJY3d47o\\%0a%3c 4) DIY 'Coke' Cola Recipe Nailed It! : DIY 'Coke' Cola Recipe Nailed It!\\%0a%3c 5) DIY Squozen Cola Vs. 10 Store Bought Cola's Ultimate Taste Off!: https://youtu.be/tTZOVAmvVoo\\%0a%3c 6) Rye & Squozen Cola Ice cream: https://youtu.be/a8fGozHUC7Y%0a---%0a> 1886 coke recipe [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWYuPE8rkeE|#]]%0a\ No newline at end of file%0a
