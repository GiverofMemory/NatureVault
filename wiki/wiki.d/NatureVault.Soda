Very few people know the 'real' secret recipe... but there are versions out there hand written by the inventor of Coke - John Pemberton. (Watch Part 2: https://youtu.be/utvx01Z6JzY)%0aOur diy Coca Cola recipe follows his 1886 version. Glen got the idea to do this back in 2011 from an NPR radio show called 'This American Life', but getting the ingredients for Coca Cola wasn't easy... and still isn't. %0a%0aObviously Coca loaf extract is the biggie in the room - but even Neroli Oil Extract is hard to get; in that it’s so expensive!%0aSo if you are going to set out and make Coca Cola at home, or any Cola recipe at home; there will be some comprises.

DIY Squozen Cola Recipe%0a%0abased partially on cube cola [[https://cube-cola.org/index.php?route=information/information&information_id=10|#]] while consulting other open source colas as well [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_cola|#]]%0a%0aWe've been working hard to refine our squozen cola recipe - a riff on a coca cola recipe from 1886. After trying a bunch of different recipes and variations we stumbled on the open cola recipe, and the cube cola recipe - both of which are close to the Pemberton 1886 coca cola formula in flavour. %0a%0aWe've used the basic method, and tweaked the ingredients.%0a%0aFlavour emulsion:%0a#7.50 mL orange oil %0a#7.00 mL lime oil %0a#2.00 mL lemon oil %0a#0.80 mL cassia oil %0a#1.50 mL nutmeg oil %0a#0.50 mL coriander oil  %0a#0.50 mL lavender oil %0a#0.50 mL neroli oil%0a#20g gum arabic%0a#40 mL water%0a%0aMethod:%0a#Measure out the oils into a small glass container.%0a#In a high sides glass mixing jug, whisk together the gum arabic and the water.%0a#While whisking the gum mixture at high speed, slowly dribble in the oils mixture. %0a#Whisk at high speed for 15-20 minutes, or until oils and water emulsify. %0a#No oils should be visible on the surface. %0a%0aCola Concentrate:%0a#200 mL double strength caramel colouring%0a#65 mL citric acid%0a#100 mL water%0a#22 mL vanilla extract%0a#2 - 5 mL Kola extract depending on your caffeine tolerance%0a#Flavour emulsion from above%0a%0aMethod:%0a#Add the caramel colouring to a medium glass flask.%0a#In another glass container stir the citric acid into the water and mix until clear.%0a#Add the citric acid water to the caramel. %0a#Mix in the Vanilla and the Kola extract.%0a#Whisk in the flavour emulsion.%0a#This is the cola concentrate, which will make 90L of cola.%0a%0aThe Cola Syrup:%0a#800 mL water%0a#1.4 kG sugar%0a#27 - 32 mL cola concentrate depending on your taste%0a%0aMethod:%0a#Dissolve the sugar in the water over low heat. %0a#This will take a while, stir and be patient. %0a#Continue stirring until the syrup is clear, remove from the heat and allow to cool to room temp.%0a#Stir in the cola concentrate. %0a#This cola syrup will make 14L of cola. %0a%0a%0aMixing the cola%0a#The cola is a 7:1 mix.%0a#1 part cola syrup to 7 parts carbonated water. %0a#You can mix by the glass, or in a corny keg.%0a%0aComments%0a#Glen, this series on colas has been fascinating to watch.   Here's another wrinkle to nailing-THAT-cola-flavour that I think is often overlooked:  flavour maturation.   About 25 years ago some friends and I analyzed Coke (early/mid 1990s) with gas chromatography and found a number of compounds not covered by the raw ingredients and in quantities far greater than the essential oils could make up.   Chief among them was isoamyl butyrate which led us to believe the syrup undergoes at least one (if not several) steps of fermentation.   It would be interesting to test the pH and specific gravity of the syrup because I'm betting the conditions are perfect for a lactobacillus fermentation (and the bacteria may naturally occur in some of the ingredients, so possibly no need to introduce a culture).   Many of the early soft drinks like root beer were yeast fermented (for both carbonation and flavour) so I don't think this process would be out of the question for Coca-Cola in it's early medicinal and soft drink forms.   It would be interesting to compare a freshly mixed batch of the syrup to some that had been standing at room temperature for a few weeks (or even a few months) to see if auto-fermentation takes place.   Keep up the great work!%0a#This recipe is great. I tried it and I love it. Better than the original. I think it tastes like a mix of mezzo mix and coke with more depth in flavor. However I had to improvise as I didn't have all the ingriedients. I don't know the exact translation of double strengh caramel colouring so I used the in europe widely available E150c. My cola appears to be a bit darker than the cola in the end of the video. The second mod is 105 ml of guarana kola tea instead of kola extract and water in step2. I used 15g of ground guarana and 10g of ground kola nut. I infused it with 100ml  hot (but not boiling) water and let it sit while mixing the emulsion. Filtered it with a coffee filter and funnel after I completed the emulsion and flushed the filter with the missing amount of water in order to get to 105ml. A bit more work than in the recipe but worked for me. I did some math and recalculated the sirup recipe to fit in a 1l bottle. The sugar sirup has a concentration of 64%25 by wheight. According to some online chart a 64%25 sugar sirup has a density of 1.3103g/l. I just used 817g of sugar, 467ml water and 20ml of the flavoring concentrate. Fits perfectly in a 1l coke bottle. I was able to mix it directly in the bottle. First add all the water and approx. half of the sugar. Shake until the sugar is dissolved then add the rest of the sugar and continue shaking. Don't forget to use gloves as the water needs to be  quite hot for this to work%0a#FYI; the mentioned concentrate which seems to be nearly identical to the one made here is available for purchas at cube-cola.%0a#Did you consider maybe adding salt? The contrast between sugar and salt may do the trick for the bite that the current recipe has...%0a#btw, coke has a licorice-ish component. not sure if it's anise or just what.%0a#Hey, have you tried adding essential oil of Star Enise into the Coke recipe? Try eating a small piece, and you will know what I mean%0a##As a keen taster, I think you're right. I think modern Coke uses it, and Dr Pepper uses it with a bit of Cherry.%0a#Could you also possibly make the caramel? Technically, caramel is sugar and water, for a dark caramel sauce it also cream, and the sugar and water is heated to around 350 - 360.%0a#You can do emulsions in a Vitamix...I would suppose a Blendtec would be able to do the same. Would be safer too :O)%0a#Recommend to start with Angostura Bitter then add some caramel , plus sugar syrup  vanilla and else  to your taste... Less dangerous lower at budget but more expandable.%0a#That surprised me! Coke always tasted like ginger to me but there was no ginger%0a#Try Moist Dark Cane Sugar (coca cola Mexican standard) ;-) next time with 100%25 distilled water it makes a big difference (coca cola standard practice)%0a#Glen & Friends Cooking - Glen, for many years, I had the notion; that " the bite", You've described in Coke; is Ginger.  A few years ago, I was dating a Young Woman, who was working as a Server in a restaurant.  One evening, We were going to Dine there. But, my stomach was upset. I asked for a Ginger Ale. That's when my date told me it was common practice NOT to stock Ginger Ale. Instead, a Bartender would pour Coca- Cola over "7-U" ! %0a#Perhaps, amongst Your Subscribers, someone with Bartending experience, can verify, that method of "making" Ginger Ale ?  If so, I believe It adds credence to my instinct that Ginger is part of the Coke Formula.  Any thoughts, Glen ?%0a#Add a tiny, scarcely detectable, amount of ginger.  It will bring everything together and add a bit of a bite.  Cheers!%0a#Try a little clove oil for a coke like flavor %0a#Have you tried it with rhubarb oil?%0a#Also, just to mention my interest here, I made a tea blend a few years back with the natural forms of all these ingredients — coca leaf, kola nut, citrus peels, vanilla beans, neroli buds, cinnamon bark, lavender flowers, and nutmeg. I didn’t add coriander seed, but might try adding some in the future.The tea blend is amazing. You’ll really want to try it out.%0a#Might be a good idea to find some crazy individual with personal gas chromatograph - you might find that secret and be surprised, how simple is. But would you be able to show that recipe on Youtube, without being punished heavily?%0a#Try adding cinnamon i can taste it in cola%0a#normally when i see people making a cola they use juice of lemon lime and orange. but you use the skin oil extract and none of the juice flavours%0a#phosphoric acid There is now - originally no. It’s harder to get small amounts for home use at this point. But I have some now and it’s amazing.%0a#Did you use honey, lime, and cilantro? Did you join the faction of a man with spikey hair that turns green at the ends%0a#And it does have sodium in it 45 mg per 12 fluid ounces%0a#I used to work in soft drink manufacturing, not for coke but we did own brand versions of things. The recipe isnt so secret, its more the flavourings are trademarked and you are only allowed to make something that tastes sort of like it. Thats why when someone tried to sell pepsi recipe to coke they sent them on their way.Coke, and other soft drinks, aim for 10 brix. In the UK we'd use glucose syrup as the base, US likely hugh fructose corn syrup, you balance with acidity, a combo of citric and malic acid (coke may not defo use the same ones). As an acidity reglator trisodium citrate is added. Colouring would mostly be malt extract, but super concentrated so you only use a little. But again cola might use this burnt caramel, own brands tend to avoid artificial flavours and big brands dont care.Flavours are 'coke' and 'coke nut extract', the latter being white and opaque. Then ofc preservatives - usually potassium sorbate as its heat stable and flavourless. Coke will add caffeine but generally own brands dont.Great video though! In industry sometimes we'd do something like this, or if its a more lucrative contract, whap it through a mass spectrometer.  this comment is wrong in that food flavor cannot be trademarked [[https://www.forbes.com/sites/ericgoldman/2014/10/22/food-flavor-cant-be-trademarked-even-if-the-baked-ziti-is-delicious/|#]] the recipe could be patented but since it is a trade secret, it can be reverse engineered.%0a#This is very cool. I am part of the Open Soda group. We spent many many years trying to create a great tasting cola as well as many other flavors. Our group is an off shoot of the original Open Cola recipe but we reformulated it a lot and improved method(thanks to the defunct Cube Cola in UK). Our flavor is some where between Coke and an American brand called RC. I have several notes on your attempt if you are interested. The acid is VERY important to your flavor. For the right flavor you need Phosphoric acid, which is hard to get and hard to get in small quantities. I know you said you were waiting on an order. Maybe you are going to get some. But you defiantly need some kind of acid. Next big one is, flavor oils don't like to mix with water. Maybe you did something to get them to mix that wasn't filmed or that I missed, cause i didn't see your oils separating and you didn't comment about them being on the top. We use gum Arabic, hopefully you know about blooming it, other wise defiantly look into that. We managed to get out hands on the professional pre bloomed stuff by just asking for a sample(which lasts us for years). Then you have to get the flavor oils to break down into very tiny particles. We use a whisk on a drill! Also oil is alcohol soluble, so just a TINY amount of vodka helps too. I caught that you put salt in, which is not a bad plan. The sodium listed in the ingredients comes from Sodium Citrate and Sodium Benzoate. The 1st boosts the flavor a bit and the second is just a preservative. So salt is a good at home replacement. Lastly, you didn't carbonate any of them(that you talked about, but I did see bubbles in the glasses so maybe you used soda water? ) so hopefully your flavor testing was against flat coke. What we have found is the major flavors of soda are - Lemon, Lime, Orange, Grapefruit, and cinnamon(technically what we get in the states is cassia). I know that sounds really citrusy, but when you blend them together well, it makes a very good cola. We have also found if you put angostura bitters in coke, it tastes just like pepsi(but bitter) so what ever pepsi's secret ingredients, is also in angostura's secret recipe. If any one wants more info on our work, I would normally point you to our website(opensoda.org) but hackers have taken it down and I haven't put it back up some where safe yet. So for now here is the recipe and instructions for our cola. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1md7XCTLOTi4CiKyBvcxnf8EGzLEvyskwwTAKnxdiRbU/edit Here's the youtube video of me making it(part 1 cause this was posted back in the 10 minute limit days)...https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqFII4xJlVwAnd here's our facebook group...https://www.facebook.com/groups/371921081422/%0a#I always thought it was obvious to everyone that coke has a lot of cinnamon flavour in it! It overpowers the citrus and caramel especially when the coke’s gone flat — it plain tastes like sugary water with cinnamon in it 😭I think the key herb in Angostura is gentian. I wish coke had a more herbal taste, the sugar was appealing when I was a kid but now I’d much prefer just a bit more complexity.%0a%0a!!!!!My notes%0a%0aFerment sugar/caramel with [[l reuteri]] and [[b infantis]]%0a%0areplace coca leaf with local antiparasitic and anti [[pasteurella]] [[parasite]] [[wuchereria]] [[vermouth]] herb or herbs like [[yarrow]] [[dandelion]] [[ground ivy]] [[nettle]].  1 gram dried herb per ml finished extract.%0a%0afigure out how to do kola nut extract, assuming same 1 gram dried to 1mL finished extract.%0a%0akeep alcohol below 0.5%25 final vol [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-alcohol_beer|#]]%0a%0adecocanized tea [[https://teaforlifeusa.com/|#]] even non decocanized passes field drug tests [[https://cocateausa.com/|#]]%0a%0amagnesium and potassium maybe a touch of sodium might be good%0a%0amight include some [[acacia]] root bark extract in gum arabic along with [[syrian rue]]...%0a%0aconsider ginger, clove%0a%0ainclude some phosphoric acid%0a%0aconsider [[cacao]]%0a%0a!!!!Open soda (from comments above)%0a%0alatest [[https://web.archive.org/web/20190915052655/http://www.opensoda.org/?p=130|#]] old version [[https://web.archive.org/web/20200809172100/http://www.opensoda.org/?p=62|#]]%0a%0aVideo's part 1 [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqFII4xJlVw|#]] part 2 [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE3WXYOFmaU|#]] part 3 [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOirRNsuLZI|#]] part 4 [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPBqMvTM6Wk|#]] part 5 carbonation [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPBpf6w_cyM|#]]%0a%0a5gal keg batch%0a#1mL vodka%0a#1mL lemon oil%0a#1mL orange oil%0a#1mL grapefruit oil%0a#1mL lime oil%0a#0.2mL cinnamon oil%0a%0a#1tsp gum arabic%0a#5g sodium citrate%0a#5g sodium benzoate%0a#1.5 tsp caramel color%0a#1.5g [[caffeine]]%0a#7.5mL [[phosphoric acid]]%0a#1.3g [[citric acid]]%0a#2240g [[sugar]]%0a%0aHardware%0a%0apipette%0a%0aglass containers%0a%0acooking pots%0a%0ascale(.1g accuracy is best)%0a%0adrill with whisk attached%0a%0aDirections%0a%0aTo start, boil water(1 cup for 2l, 10 cups for 5gal). Once the water is boiling, add in sugar and stir to dissolve. Decrease heat to medium so that solution is barley at a boil. Add both acids to the solution. Allow to cook for 30 minutes or until it reaches a light amber color.%0a%0aWhile sugar is cooking, mix vodka and flavor oils in small glass container with pipette. Next, dissolve the gum arabic in a very small amount of water in a medium sized glass container. Your container should just barely be the size to allow your whisk attached to your drill to fit in. Contact with the sides is necessary. Pour your flavor oils into the water and gum arabic mixture and pour some back and forth to get every drop of oil. Mix the solution as high as you can for several minutes with the drill/whisk assembly. Then add the sodium citrate, sodium benzoate, and caffeine(optional) to the mixture and mix until fully dissolved.%0a%0aWhen the sugar is done cooking, pour mixture in. Pour a bit of water into the mixing vessel to get any remaining mix out and pour into sugar. This concentrate is very potent and every last bit counts. Finally, add coloring to the resulting syrup and mix. Now just pour into final container(2l bottle or 5gal keg), fill up with water(don’t forget to pour water into the pot the syrup was in to get every last drop of syrup out), and carbonate using one of the carbonation methods.%0a%0aVariants on other side%0a%0aVariants%0a%0aVariant 1 – Precise acid measurement vs acid mix%0a%0aIf you don’t have a scale precise enough to measure down to .1g, you can mix an acid mix 1st. In 2l bottle of water, add%0a%0a100 g Sodium Citrate\\%0a100 g Sodium Benzoate\\%0a26 g Citric Acid\\%0aThen for a 5 gal keg, use 100ml of the mix. Each 100ml will contain 5g Sodium Citrate, 5g Sodium Citrate, and 1.3g Citric Acid. For 2l size, use 10ml of the mix. Warning, this mix crystallizes fast. This is why we don’t recommend this method. If you store this mix for any amount of time,  you will have to heat up the water(with out losing any of it else you throw off your ratio) and shake VIGOROUSLY to get back into solution.%0a%0aVariant 2 – Diet or regular%0a%0aIf you want to create diet version of any recipe, replace the sugar with Splenda. 275g for 5gal(one large bag) or 27.5g for a 2l.%0a%0aVariant 3 – blender vs vodka%0a%0aThe vodka is used because oil is alcohol soluble and this vastly helps smooth out the flavor notes. If for some reason you do not wish to use the alcohol, you need to mix for a much longer time. If you don’t have a proper drill/whisk assembly, you can us a blender, but you need to add enough water to come up over the blades. Also, do not use plastic blender, the gum aribic will stick to it very badly. Use a glass blender and mix for several minutes.%0a%0aJune 27th 2009%0a%0a----%0a%0aSecret of Pepsi one step closer and caffine warning%0aWhile at a friend’s birthday party, some one got some Angostura bitters, which was used as a flavor additive for whiskey. He was having people give it a sniff. I being a super taster, I immediately recognized the smell as the same ingredient in Pepsi that I’ve been trying to find! After me telling the rest of the party this, they agreed. We put some in glasses of coke, and PRESTO! Pepsi! But with a very bitter after taste. Now Angostura bitters is them self made from a secret recipe. But it’s a place to start.%0a%0aAlso I was sent a link on the dangers of Caffeine.

Try a dev batch(no oils) for comparison with batch 1. Also will try the 1/8 tsp meringue powder.%0a%0aResults: made up a batch of dev as well as batch of just acid mix and just phosphoric acid. Taste does not seem to be in those. Could it be just sugar? Made up a batch of just sugar, taste seems to be in the just sugar mixture. Need a bit%0aless meringue powder. Perhaps 1/16th tsp.%0a%0aAlso, lemon and lime flavors seemed to strong. Made a batch of just .5ml less of lemon lime. Much better taste.%0a%0aResearched simple syrups more. Turns out, just adding heat will not break down the sucrose into fructose and glucose. You need to add an acid. Following online instructions, made a batch of a 1:1 simple syrup with a tsp of cream of tarter. Put on low boil for 25 minutes. Mixed with 2 liters of water and it tasted much better then our old method.

Once the water is boiling, add in sugar and stir to dissolve. Decrease heat to medium so that solution is barley at a boil. Add both acids to the solution. Allow to cook for 30 minutes or until it reaches a light amber color.%0a%3c %0a%3c While sugar is cooking, mix vodka and flavor oils in small glass container with pipette. Next, dissolve the gum arabic in a very small amount of water in a medium sized glass container. Your container should just barely be the size to allow your whisk attached to your drill to fit in. Contact with the sides is necessary. Pour your flavor oils into the water and gum arabic mixture and pour some back and forth to get every drop of oil. Mix the solution as high as you can for several minutes with the drill/whisk assembly. Then add the sodium citrate, sodium benzoate, and caffeine(optional) to the mixture and mix until fully dissolved.%0a%3c %0a%3c When the sugar is done cooking, pour mixture in. Pour a bit of water into the mixing vessel to get any remaining mix out and pour into sugar. This concentrate is very potent and every last bit counts. Finally, add coloring to the resulting syrup and mix. Now just pour into final container(2l bottle or 5gal keg), fill up with water(don’t forget to pour water into the pot the syrup was in to get every last drop of syrup out), and carbonate using one of the carbonation methods.%0a%3c %0a%3c Variants on other side%0a%3c %0a%3c Variants%0a%3c %0a%3c Variant 1 – Precise acid measurement vs acid mix%0a%3c %0a%3c If you don’t have a scale precise enough to measure down to .1g, you can mix an acid mix 1st. In 2l bottle of water, add%0a%3c %0a%3c 100 g Sodium Citrate\\%0a%3c 100 g Sodium Benzoate\\%0a%3c 26 g Citric Acid\\%0a%3c Then for a 5 gal keg, use 100ml of the mix. Each 100ml will contain 5g Sodium Citrate, 5g Sodium Citrate, and 1.3g Citric Acid. For 2l size, use 10ml of the mix. Warning, this mix crystallizes fast. This is why we don’t recommend this method. If you store this mix for any amount of time,  you will have to heat up the water(with out losing any of it else you throw off your ratio) and shake VIGOROUSLY to get back into solution.%0a%3c %0a%3c Variant 2 – Diet or regular%0a%3c %0a%3c If you want to create diet version of any recipe, replace the sugar with Splenda. 275g for 5gal(one large bag) or 27.5g for a 2l.%0a%3c %0a%3c Variant 3 – blender vs vodka%0a%3c %0a%3c The vodka is used because oil is alcohol soluble and this vastly helps smooth out the flavor notes. If for some reason you do not wish to use the alcohol, you need to mix for a much longer time. If you don’t have a proper drill/whisk assembly, you can us a blender, but you need to add enough water to come up over the blades. Also, do not use plastic blender, the gum aribic will stick to it very badly. Use a glass blender and mix for several minutes.%0a%3c %0a%3c June 27th 2009%0a%3c %0a---%0a> #0.1mL lemon oil%0a> #0.1mL orange oil%0a> #0.1mL grapefruit oil%0a> #0.1mL lime oil%0a> #1 drop cinnamon oil%0a

diff:1674199866:1674199723:=238c238%0a%3c #This is very cool. I am part of the Open Soda group. We spent many many years trying to create a great tasting cola as well as many other flavors. Our group is an off shoot of the original Open Cola recipe but we reformulated it a lot and improved method(thanks to the defunct Cube Cola in UK). Our flavor is some where between Coke and an American brand called RC. I have several notes on your attempt if you are interested. The acid is VERY important to your flavor. For the right flavor you need Phosphoric acid, which is hard to get and hard to get in small quantities. I know you said you were waiting on an order. Maybe you are going to get some. But you defiantly need some kind of acid. Next big one is, flavor oils don't like to mix with water. Maybe you did something to get them to mix that wasn't filmed or that I missed, cause i didn't see your oils separating and you didn't comment about them being on the top. We use gum Arabic, hopefully you know about blooming it, other wise defiantly look into that. We managed to get out hands on the professional pre bloomed stuff by just asking for a sample(which lasts us for years). Then you have to get the flavor oils to break down into very tiny particles. We use a whisk on a drill! Also oil is alcohol soluble, so just a TINY amount of vodka helps too. I caught that you put salt in, which is not a bad plan. The sodium listed in the ingredients comes from Sodium Citrate and Sodium Benzoate. The 1st boosts the flavor a bit and the second is just a preservative. So salt is a good at home replacement. Lastly, you didn't carbonate any of them(that you talked about, but I did see bubbles in the glasses so maybe you used soda water? ) so hopefully your flavor testing was against flat coke. What we have found is the major flavors of soda are - Lemon, Lime, Orange, Grapefruit, and cinnamon(technically what we get in the states is cassia). I know that sounds really citrusy, but when you blend them together well, it makes a very good cola. We have also found if you put angostura bitters in coke, it tastes just like pepsi(but bitter) so what ever pepsi's secret ingredients, is also in angostura's secret recipe. If any one wants more info on our work, I would normally point you to our website(opensoda.org) but hackers have taken it down and I haven't put it back up some where safe yet. So for now here is the recipe and instructions for our cola. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1md7XCTLOTi4CiKyBvcxnf8EGzLEvyskwwTAKnxdiRbU/edit Here's the youtube video of me making it(part 1 cause this was posted back in the 10 minute limit days)...https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqFII4xJlVwAnd here's our facebook group...https://www.facebook.com/groups/371921081422/%0a---%0a> %0a

The recipe isnt so secret, its more the flavourings are trademarked and you are only allowed to make something that tastes sort of like it.

But again cola might use this burnt caramel, own brands tend to avoid artificial flavours and big brands dont care.Flavours are 'coke' and 'coke nut extract', the latter being white and opaque.

Instead, a Bartender would pour Coca- Cola over "7-U" ! %0a%3c Perhaps, amongst Your Subscribers, someone with Bartending experience, can verify, that method of "making" Ginger Ale ?

Here's another wrinkle to nailing-THAT-cola-flavour that I think is often overlooked:  flavour maturation.   About 25 years ago some friends and I analyzed Coke (early/mid 1990s) with gas chromatography and found a number of compounds not covered by the raw ingredients and in quantities far greater than the essential oils could make up.   Chief among them was isoamyl butyrate which led us to believe the syrup undergoes at least one (if not several) steps of fermentation.   It would be interesting to test the pH and specific gravity of the syrup because I'm betting the conditions are perfect for a lactobacillus fermentation (and the bacteria may naturally occur in some of the ingredients, so possibly no need to introduce a culture).   Many of the early soft drinks like root beer were yeast fermented (for both carbonation and flavour) so I don't think this process would be out of the question for Coca-Cola in it's early medicinal and soft drink forms.   It would be interesting to compare a freshly mixed batch of the syrup to some that had been standing at room temperature for a few weeks (or even a few months) to see if auto-fermentation takes place.   Keep up the great work!%0a

A lot of people sort of expect that the cocaine that's in coca-cola or was in coca-cola at that time was put in by some guy, you know pour in a bag of white powdery purified cocaine. Which wasn't the case they were using an extract of the coca leaf. But it wasn't pure cocaine it was sort of a mix between the botanical bittering compounds and the alkaloids but not pure cocaine. %0a%3c So thank you everybody for pointing out that I didn't use cocaine I didn't use cocaine because it's not in the recipe. %0a%3c %0a%3c The second group of people were all about the Kola nut, and by that point in the recipe Kola nut wasn't used in%0a%3c coca-cola he just wanted straight caffeine didn't want the flavour, he only wanted to hit the caffeine so he was using citrate of caffeine which is pure caffeine.%0a%3c %0a%3c So now I've got that out of the way we're gonna move on and we're gonna start playing with some of the things that we've found out when we made that recipe and we're going to start honing it in and we're going to turn it into Squozen Cola %0a%3c %0a%3c The Whole Cola Playlist:\\%0a%3c 1) We Made 1886 Coca Cola Recipe: https://youtu.be/IWYuPE8rkeE\\%0a%3c 2) Making Squozen Cola Recipe: https://youtu.be/utvx01Z6JzY\\%0a%3c 3) How We Carbonate Our Soda Water: https://youtu.be/9vRaJY3d47o\\%0a%3c 4) DIY 'Coke' Cola Recipe Nailed It! : DIY 'Coke' Cola Recipe Nailed It! \\%0a%3c 5) DIY Squozen Cola Vs. 10 Store Bought Cola's Ultimate Taste Off!: https://youtu.be/tTZOVAmvVoo\\%0a%3c 6) Rye & Squozen Cola Ice cream: https://youtu.be/a8fGozHUC7Y\\%0a%3c %0a%3c Syrup Base:%0a%3c #Water 1.18L%0a%3c #Sugar 1 Kg%0a%3c #Caramel 15 mL%0a%3c #FE Coca 1.3 mL %0a%3c #Vanilla 5 mL%0a%3c #Caffeine .75 mL%0a%3c #Lime Juice 75 mL %0a%3c #Citric Acid 15g%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 7X Flavor (use 15mL per 19L) 3.5 mL / 1L%0a%3c  %0a%3c 236 mL (8 oz) Alcohol %0a%3c #20 drops (0.5g / 1 mL) Orange Oil %0a%3c #30 drops (0.75g / 1.5 mL) Lemon Oil %0a%3c #10 drops (0.25g / .5 mL) Nutmeg Oil %0a%3c #5 drops (0.125g / .25 mL) Corriander Oil %0a%3c #10 drops (0.25g / .5 mL) Neroli Oil %0a%3c #10 drops (0.25g / .5 mL) Cinnamon Oil %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Method:%0a%3c #Mix together all of the ingredients of the 7X Flavour.%0a%3c #Set this aside in a sealed bottle.%0a%3c #Heat the water sugar and caramel in a large pot.%0a%3c #Stirring continuously, just until sugar is dissolved.%0a%3c #Take off the heat and mix in vanilla, caffeine, lime juice and citric acid.%0a%3c #Stir to fully combine.%0a%3c #Add a measured amount of 7X flavouring to the sugar syrup.%0a%3c %0a%3c Mix with carbonated water at a ratio of one part syrup and 5 parts water.%0a%3c %0a
