csum=They did cut sugar [[high fructose corn syrup]] by 8%25 in canada and reduced can size from 355ml (12 oz) to 310 mL in 2015 [[https://web.archive.org/web/20201223150053/https://www.theloop.ca/coke-just-changed-its-recipe-and-itll-never-taste-the-same-again/|#]].  My guess is at the same time in the US they lowered sugar by an amount not required to be disclosed by law, perhaps 4%25 (a rounding error) and also reduced [[phosphoric acid]] and [[caramel color]] and even [[carbonic acid]] to save money.  Since I have had "good" coke in the recent past in 2022, I figure only some plants are implementing the changes so they can jusge consumer discontent during the eventual nationwide rollout.
