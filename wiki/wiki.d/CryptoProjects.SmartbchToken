We will also do a grant program with some donations and the RULE community can vote (by donating RULE, and also by a weight of how much RULE LP you hold) on which proposals we fund.  Each proposal will be matched with another, and 2 donation addresses will be provided.  If more donations come into address A than address B, then proposal A gets funded.  However the donations that come in will not be used to fund that proposal, just for tallying votes.  The donations received will be added to the pool for future proposals.  If you loose, no problem, you can edit your proposal and resubmit.  We will match proposals with similar amounts asked for with each other, also we will prioritize voting on proposals that ask for minimal RULE over proposals that ask for a lot. In terms of figuring out which proposals make it to the the final vote-by-sending-RULE, your stake of RULE LP (how much RULE you added to liquidity) will be used to vote.%0a%0a#Animate Logo/token%0a%0a#Create nice website%0a%0a#Apply for listings on metamask, coingecko, smartscan.cash etc.%0a%0a!!!FAQ%0a%0a!!!!Why only 1 token?%0a%0aIt sounded like a fun idea.  I remember hearing someone online say that if bitcoin only had 1 coin that it would make no difference.  A couple years later and having fun on SmartBCH I thought that it would be a fun experiment, I wondered what would happen.  So I did it.  I was worried no one would buy it.  The entire 1 coin liquidity was paired with $1 of BCH and no one bought it for several hours.  I thought to myself if it doesn't take off then the experiment showed that this just wasn't something people wanted.  The experiment would be over.  But then the buys started coming in... and we have 750x'd in just a few days.%0a%0a!!!!What makes you think this will succeed?%0a%0aNothing really.  Just hope I guess.  Everytime I nervously check [[https://www.smartscan.cash/address/0xeafaa9dfebf22faa88fd634701a249b23359094e |our liquidity]] it helps calm me that I do have people fighting side by side with me to see this succeed.  And that is a really good feeling.  In fact the first thing I did after writing this was checking the liquidity!  So I am still not sure, but I am hopefull.%0a%0a!!!!What is the point?%0a%0aWell it is a fixed supply asset, much the same as many out there.  However I am a big proponent of slightly inflationary coins like Dogecoin.  I created a slightly inflationary coin on SmartBCH called TEEF where the coin supply increases with every product I produce.  I also have other inflationary coin designs I am working on.  And I figured why not have a deflationary one.  The reason why I am pro-inflation is that I strongly believe that money should be frictionless and light.  When you use an appreciating asset for money people would rather hold on to it than use it for its actual purpose: to facilitate transfer of goods.  However in thinking about and designing RULE I came to a realization.  Inflationary design prevents "economic rents" on the token, which means it prevents people from squatting on the token and making it expensive for newcomers to get some.  This squatting isn't ideal.  But what if with RULE instead of forced redistribution caused by inflation, what if we could create a culture of voluntary redistribution?  Yes your share of the pie will never go down on you against your will, but can we make it fair for new RULERS to join the fold?  I think we can, and my vision is that we encourage holders to add 10%25 of their RULE to liquidity.  This will play a huge part of this goal, and it will make sure that holders always have BCH on hand as well and that their BCH will likely keep growing because of their liquidity returns.  This decentralized liquidity is absolutely essential for the coin to grow.  The more robust the liquidity, the faster we can grow. Also I encourage no holder to amass more than roughly 20%25 of the max supply, so 0.2 RULE.  If you want to keep buying to support the price that is great!  But do consider giving the extra to friends or donating a bit to our faucet so those less fortunate can become RULERS too!%0a%0a!!!!If you want to be cash, why not just use wBCH?  Why another token?%0a%0aWell that is a good point and takes some study to come up with an answer.  The main thing is it has a totally different distribution model than BCH.  BCH is mined, and you can mine it or buy it from a centralized exchange.  With RULE I started it with 1 RULE and 0.0025 ($1) of BCH in liquidity.  I didn't do this because I am poor.  I did it because I didn't want whales to take advantage of the community.  The biggest holders of RULE are the ones who believe in it the most, people who understood the concept intuitively immediately.  They took a risk on a no-name coin with exactly 0 hype and they deserve the spot they have.  I think they will tend the community and help it grow.  In fact I am counting on it.  Aside from the very different distribution model also the values and culture of our coin I hope are a bit different than any other out there.  The combination of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntaryism|voluntaryism]] and generosity I think will be unmatched and will cause us to soar to the stratosphere.%0a%0a!!!!Why not create a bunch of supply?%0a%0aI tend to fall into the camp of "create a bunch of coins and have no decimals" or "create one coin and have all decimals".  As you can see with bitcoin now there is a dillema, do we count in fractions of bitcoins or in satoshi's?  It is actually a slight conflict in the community about when is the right time to shift to satoshi's.  I think bitcoin should have set the max supply as 1 coin, because then from the beginning and forever it would be measured in satoshi's.  There is no conflict and strangeness this way.  With 18 decimals with RULE, even though there is only 1 token, there are 1 quintillion units, even more than bitcoin has satoshi's.  I think you will come to think of RULE as your most valuable asset.  And if you can be generous with your most precious possession, then you have become someone great indeed.%0a%0a!!!!You gonna rug-pull us?%0a%0aI can't rug-pull you.  I renounced ownership of the contract [[https://www.smartscan.cash/transaction/0xeffe557fd343434e10e34b5588ea1a83cceced144d3691ac5465d5765dd730ff|#]] which means I cannot mint any more tokens, can't burn tokens, etc.  Secondly I burned all the LP tokens [[https://www.smartscan.cash/transaction/0x055b2833fec4e9b4cc58769f565942346d08bd0694480865a18a670a1e53920e|#]].  This means that I cannot ever remove liquidity.  This is better than a liquidity lock, because this is permanent.  No wondering what I will do after the lock expires.  The community is fully in control, and now the liquidity provided initially is only a 25%25 share and decreasing, so it is your fellow RULER peers that are running the coin now!  %0a%0aIf tropical ever goes offline the original liquidity will be lost but the rest of the community will be able to move their liquidity to another swap and no harm will come to RULE.  It is designed to last for hundreds of years or more, as long as Bitcoin Cash is around, and I am sure BCH will be around long after BTC looses steam.%0a%0a!!!!What inspired the name?%0a%0aI am a big fan of the Matrix and Lord of the Rings so those should be obvious inspirations.  Of course "the one" refers to their only being 1 coin.  And RULE was inspired by the One Ring in LotR.  The name "One Token" was already taken and I figured "The One" was cool because it wasn't a blatant rip-off of LotR and also [[ https://matrix.fandom.com/wiki/The_One| hearkened to the Matrix]]. I think our community will be able to bend the apparent rules of monetary reality.%0a%0aThe logo is built on the golden ratio of the circle areas, and this golden ratio is related to buying up a coin on a swap.  The first buy of RULE was 13%25 of the supply.  Then the next buy was 13%25 of the remaining and so on.  So the 1 entire token will never be able to be fully bought, just like the circles keep getting smaller but never end. And it goes from darkness into light.%0a%0a!!!!What should we know about you?%0a%0aWell first and foremost I am a designer and not really a coder although I try to dabble in it.  Because of that I am eternally grateful for the open source software movement, because it gives people like me the ability to turn dreams into reality without having a big team. My biggest strengths are working with ideas, coming up with how to make ideas possible and how these possibilities fit in with the meta landscape.  I often think about what does humanity need and work on solutions to provide that in the best way possible.  I am also a somewhat strong leader online, much more outgoing online than in person.  I am an INTP but more of an ENTP when online.  I have lead clans in MMORPG's and typically am one of the biggest influences and voices on a server.  I guess my biggest ideals are Liberty and [[ https://www.naturehacker.org/2019/03/givism-because-capitalism-and-socialism.html| Givism]].  I am also a health nut because I have to work hard to stay healthy.  I was not dealt the best hand when it comes to health but I make due and try to help others with what I learn.%0a%0a!!!!Wen Moon?%0a%0aIf everyone does their part and adds 10%25 of their holdings (or more if you are willing) to liquidity and give say 1%25 to the faucet or your friends (which will increase our holders and increase adoption and word of mouth) then we enter hyperspace, I'm sure!%0a%0a!!!!So what's "the one rule?"%0a%0aBe excellent to each other, and party on dudes!%0a!!TEEF Token: TEEF 0xe691221eD15BA1E2491B552db955191789d9a8d9%0aSee [[https://www.teefpowder.com|TEEF

diff:1641788018:1641787937:=73c73%0a%3c Well it is a fixed supply asset, much the same as many out there.  However I am a big proponent of slightly inflationary coins like Dogecoin.  I created a slightly inflationary coin on SmartBCH called TEEF where the coin supply increases with every product I produce.  I also have other inflationary coin designs I am working on.  And I figured why not have a deflationary one.  The reason why I am pro-inflation is that I strongly believe that money should be frictionless and light.  When you use an appreciating asset for money people would rather hold on to it than use it for its actual purpose: to facilitate transfer of goods.  However in thinking about and designing RULE I came to a realization.  Inflationary design prevents "economic rents" on the token, which means it prevents people from squatting on the token and making it expensive for newcomers to get some.  This squatting isn't ideal.  But what if with RULE instead of forced redistribution caused by inflation, what if we could create a culture of voluntary redistribution?  Yes your share of the pie will never go down on you against your will, but can we make it fair for new RULERS to join the fold?  I think we can, and my vision is that we encourage holders to add 10%25 of their RULE to liquidity.  This will play a huge part of this goal, and it will make sure that holders always have BCH on hand as well and that their BCH will likely keep growing because of their liquidity returns.  This decentralized liquidity is absolutely essential for the coin to grow.  The more robust the liquidity, the faster we can grow. Also I encourage no holder to amass more than roughly 20%25 of the max supply, so 0.2 RULE.  If you want to keep buying to support the price that is great!  But do consider giving the extra to friends or donating a bit to our faucet so those less fortunate can become RULERS too!%0a---%0a> Well it is a fixed supply asset, much the same as many out there.

I think bitcoin should have had the max supply as 1 coin, because then from the beginning and forever it would be measured in satoshi's.  There is no conflict and strangeness this way.  With 18 decimals with RULE, even though there is only 1 token, there are 1 quintillion units, even more than bitcoin has satoshi's.  I think you will come to think of RULE as your most valuable asset.%0a---%0a> I tend to fall into the camp of "create a bunch of coins and have no decimals" or "create one coin and have all decimals".

BCH is mined, and you can mine it or buy it from a centralized exchange.  With RULE I started it with 1 RULE and 0.0025 ($1) of BCH in liquidity.  I didn't do this because I am poor.  I did it because I didn't want whales to take advantage of the community.  The biggest holders of RULE are the ones who believe in it the most, people who understood the concept intuitively immediately.  They took a risk on a no-name coin with exactly 0 hype and they deserve the spot they have.  I think they will tend the community and help it grow.  In fact I am counting on it.

I created a slightly inflationary coin on SmartBCH called TEEF where the coin supply increases with every product I produce.  I also have other inflationary coin designs I am working on.  And I figured why not have a deflationary one.  The reason why I am pro-inflation is that I strongly believe that money should be frictionless and light.  When you use an appreciating asset for money people would rather hold on to it than use it for its actual purpose: to facilitate transfer of goods.  However in thinking about and designing RULE I came to a realization.  Inflationary design prevents "economic rents" on the token, which means it prevents people from squatting on the token and making it expensive for newcomers to get some.  This squatting isn't ideal.  But what if with RULE instead of forced redistribution caused by inflation, what if we could create a culture of voluntary redistribution?  Yes your share of the pie will never go down on you against your will, but can we make it fair for new RULERS to join the fold?  I think we can, and my vision is that we encourage holders to add 10%25 of their RULE to liquidity.  This will play a huge part of this goal, and it will make sure that holders always have BCH on hand as well and that their BCH will likely keep growing because of their liquidity returns.  This decentralized liquidity is absolutely essential for the coin to grow.  The more robust the liquidity, the faster we can grow. Also I encourage no holder to amass more than roughly 20%25 of the max supply, so 0.2 RULE.  If you want to keep buying to support the price that is great!

A couple years later and having fun on SmartBCH I thought that it would be a fun experiment, I wondered what would happen.  So I did it.  I was worried no one would buy it.  The entire 1 coin liquidity was paired with $1 of BCH and no one bought it for several hours.  I thought to myself if it doesn't take off then the experiment showed that this just wasn't something people wanted.  The experiment would be complete.

Yes your share of the pie will never go down on you against your will, but can we make it fair for new RULERS to join the fold?  I think we can, and my vision is that we encourage holders to add 10%25 of their holdings to liquidity.  This will play a huge part of this goal, and it will make sure that holders always have BCH on hand as well and that BCH will likely keep growing because of their liquidity returns.  Also I encourage no holder to amass more than roughly 20%25 of the max supply.  If you want to keep buying to support the price that is great!  But do consider donating a bit to our faucet so those less fortunate can become RULERS too!%0a

diff:1641780311:1641779774:=75,81d74%0a%3c !!!!Why not create a bunch of tokens?%0a%3c %0a%3c I tend to fall into the camp of "create a bunch of coins and have no decimals" or "create one coin and have all decimals".  As you can see with bitcoin now there is a dillema, do we count in fractions of bitcoins or in satoshi's?  It is actually a slight conflict in the community about when is the right time to shift to satoshi's.  I think bitcoin should have had the max supply as 1 coin, because then from the beginning and forever it would be measured in satoshi's.  There is no conflict and strangeness this way.  With 18 decimals with RULE, even though there is only 1 token, there are 1 quintillion units, even more than bitcoin has satoshi's.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Wen Moon?%0a%3c %0a%3c If everyone does their part and adds 10%25 of their holdings (or more if you are willing) to liquidity and give say 1%25 to the faucet (which will increase our holders and increase adoption and word of mouth) then we enter hyperspace, I'm sure!%0a

Why another token?%0a%3c %0a%3c Well that is a good point and takes some study to come up with an answer.  The main thing is it has a totally different distribution model than BCH.  BCH is mined, and you can mine it or buy it from a centralized exchange.  With RULE I started it with 1 coin and $1 of BCH in liquidity.  I didn't do this because I am poor.  I did it because I didn't want whales to take advantage of the community.  The biggest holders of RULE are the ones who believe in it the most, people who understood the concept intuitively immediately.  They took a risk on a no-name coin with exactly 0 hype and they deserve the spot they have.  I think they will tend the community and help it grow.  In fact I am counting on it.  Aside from the very different distribution model also the values and culture of our coin I hope are a bit different than any other out there.  The combination of voluntaryism and generosity I think will be unmatched and will cause us to soar to the stratosphere.%0a%3c %0a
