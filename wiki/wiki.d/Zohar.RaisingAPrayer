text=Raising a Prayer %0a%0a%0a%0aHere The Zohar speaks about the prayer, which every man offers his Creator %0a(Veyikahel, pp. 32-52). This inner action of man constitutes his greatest and most %0avaluable work in his efforts for the Creator's sake. %0a%0aThe Creator made man at the farthest, completely opposite spiritual le %0aHis: with only the egoistic will to enjoy. And since man has no other properti %0adesires but the egoistic will to receive pleasure, not only is he unable to chang- %0ahimself, he cannot even wish for the desire to change. %0a%0aWe can change only under the influence of the Creator's Light, by receivin %0aHis properties from Him. Hence our only task is to cultivate a desire to change. %0aAs soon as this true desire appears within man, the Creator will immediately %0ajive him the strength needed for its realization. So the problem is not how %0a%0a)rayer; it is, rather, how to attain it, how to formulate one's reque %0ale strength to become like the Creator! %0a%0aA prayer is a sensation, a desire in one's heart. Man does not re; %0acompletely and cannot describe it, for the sensation in one's heart is %0anot subject to any control and conscious correction— it cannot be "created" by %0aone's own will. The sensations in one's heart constitute the consequence of %0aman's mental and spiritual condition, the result of the current degree of his %0aspiritual development. %0a%0aThus, the desire to change is also in the Creator's hands. However, He %0aus the opportunity to stimulate this process and to determine our own %0alal advancement: %0a%0a)balists to write books, and when we read them %0a%0a%0a%0alows %0a%0a%0a%0adevelop the desire to draw closer to Him; %0a- He allows some of the true Kabbalists to be revealed to a wide circle %0a%0a%0a%0a473 %0a%0a%0a%0a474 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0aIndiscernibly, He transforms our desires (modifies our souls) so %0ally take an interest in spirituality; %0a%0ale changes our desires with regard to this world, helping us realize %0ainsignificance and transience through sensations of disappoint %0amd suffering. %0a%0a3y creating man a worthless egoist, i.e., by making a worthless creation that %0ais seemingly so unbefitting Him, the Creator allowed man to create himself and %0aelevate himself to an equal degree to that of the Creator Himself— to attain His %0asvel of perfection. Thus, the Creator reveals the perfection of His creatior %0ay\i He created man a worthless creature, He thereby enables him to ma %0aCreator" of himself (in his properties). %0a%0ainnot claim that although he is created with only one desire %0aunable to induce the reception of an altruistic desire instead of his natura %0aegoistic one. The Torah, Kabbalah, teachers, and suffering are all prepared to %0aaccelerate his advancement toward the goal of creation by the path of the Torah, %0aor otherwise, the path of suffering. %0a%0aHowever, the path of suffering is not only undesirable for man, whose life %0aon earth makes him feel as though he is caught between the millstones %0atirelessly revolving mill. Ruthlessly and methodically, it pulverizes hir %0amentally and physically, to the very last day of his life. But this painful path is %0aequally undesirable in the eyes of the Creator. After all, His goal is to delight %0aman, which is in accord with the path of the Torah— a quick and painless way to %0atransform our desires from egoistic into altruistic. %0a%0aSince only the Creator can accomplish this (and He will, either painfully %0aor painlessly, in accord with our conscious request), the development of sue! %0arequest toward Him is all that man must do in his life. It is hence written: "I %0ahim pray all day long!" Yet, we now understand that this phrase does not spe %0aof sitting over a prayer-book, but refers to man's inner work on himself. %0a%0aThere are various forms of work that man must do in action, with his body, %0aas in the case of physically observing the Mitzvot. And then there is man's inner, %0amost important work, when observance of the Mitzvot depends on the words %0aand desires of the heart. %0a%0aNever does Kabbalah allude to or even mention our physical body, for it %0ais no different from the body of an animal— it is born, functions, and dies as %0aan animal. And all the various forms of work that the body performs are mere %0amechanical actions utterly unconnected to man's inner intention, and can even %0a%0a%0a%0anose me %0anes of a %0a%0a%0a%0aRaising a Prayer %0a%0a%0a%0a475 %0a%0a%0a%0a%0afore, the body's actions are completely disregarded in Kabba %0a's desire is taken into account and is regarded as an action. In itself %0ad off the physical body (in which it presently exists), it constitutes %0airitual action. %0a%0alal world is a world of incorporeal desires that have no voh %0asize, movement, or time. Just as in our imagination, where our desires are %0afulfilled instantly by the power of thought, everything in the spiritual world is %0adetermined only by our desires-thoughts, and not by physical actions. %0a%0aNevertheless, since in this world we temporarily exist in a physiological body, %0aour task is to observe the Creator's Mitzvot both physically (with our body) and %0aspiritually. Physically, we can observe them, as a person usually does— because %0aof his upbringing or for a reward in this world (money, health, luck, peace, and %0aso forth) or in the world to come (the best that he can imagine). Alternatively, %0ahe performs these actions because he was taught from childhood to do so %0amechanically, so he cannot avoid doing them in view of the acquired desire %0a(instinct)— if he does not do them, he suffers. %0a%0aThis feeling of suffering is exactly what compels him to carry out the %0amechanical actions of the Mitzvot. It is not even the desire to receive a reward %0ain this world or in the world to come: in this case, the reward is instantaneous- %0aman feels no discomfort, since he does what he is accustomed to do. %0a%0aHence, it seems to such a man, who observes the Mitzvot because of the %0aacquired nature (habit), that he demands no reward for his actions either in %0athis world or in the world to come. After all, he truly does not think about any %0areward, as his habit, which became his second nature, compels him to perform %0athese actions. If he feels this way, he is absolutely positive that he acts "for the %0aCreator's sake." The fact that his habit, his second nature, compels him to %0aperform the Mitzvot mechanically, escapes his awareness. %0a%0aHowever, since our body is no more than an animal, the mechanical %0afulfillment of the Mitzvot by force of habit or for a reward is quite sufficient for %0ahim. There is a difference between those who observe because of upbringing or %0ahabit, and those who do it for a reward: the former do not even care whether %0aor not the Creator actually exists; they perform purely mechanical actions that %0athey cannot help performing, for they immediately begin to suffer for lack of %0ahabitual actions. %0a%0aYet, one who observes the Mitzvot because he has faith in reward and %0apunishment believes in the Creator, His Torah, and His governance, but simply %0a%0a%0a%0a476 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0a%0auses it for his own benefit. By observing the Mitzvot with such an intention %0aand remaining in it all of his life, he, naturally, does not grow spiritually. And %0ahe who does not grow in our world is called "still" (inanimate), as we divide all %0anature into the following levels: still, vegetative, animate, and speaking (human). %0aTherefore, such people are regarded as spiritually still (Domem de Kedusha), but %0athey are already "spiritually" still, as opposed to those who observe mechanically, %0aby force of habit. %0a%0aIn Kabbalah, the word "body" implies desire. A desire or a body can be %0agoistic or spiritual (altruistic). The gradual passing of the egoistic body and its %0a%0a%0a%0a: with the altruistic one is called man's "spiritual birth." %0a%0aMan's spiritual growth is designated by an increasingly growing intention %0ato observe the Mitzvot only because such is the Creator's desire. Man observes %0ait only for His sake, completely selflessly, as if no reward of any kind will ever %0abe given to him in return, not even in the form of his own self-content. It is %0aas though the Creator does not know who fulfills His desire, as though man %0ahimself is uncertain of whether or not he observes the Mitzvot. Yet, he does it %0aanyway, for such is the Creator's will. %0a%0aSo then, the notion of "body" in Kabbalah alludes to man's corrected %0a;sires, whereas uncorrected desires, without a screen, cannot be used, %0aigh they are not considered body parts, existing beyond the body, %0aconsidered foreign forces or desires— Klipot (shells). %0a%0aonly existing creation besides the Creator is the egoistic will tc %0alim that was created by Him. This desire can be either egoistic (corrupted) or %0aaltruistic (corrected), spiritually pure or impure. All the spiritual forces: angels, %0aKlipot, etc., constitute our uncorrected or corrected desires (the will to bestow %0adelight upon the Creator). Nothing else exists in the universe! %0a%0aThere are twelve parts in the spiritual body that perform spiritual actions: %0atwo arms and two legs, each consisting of three parts, in all 4 x 3 = 12. These %0aparts of our spiritual body (our desires that were corrected by the screen) observe %0athe positive Mitzvot. %0a%0aJust like the body of a spiritual object (Partzuf), man's body is his altruistic %0adesires, in which he can receive the Creator's Light according to his intentions %0a(screen). Man's desires are determined by his intentions. %0a%0aAll the work with the intention "for the Creator's sake" is performed by %0athe external body parts: the twelve parts of arms and legs, and by the twelve %0ainternal body parts: brain, heart, liver, mouth, tongue, five parts of the lungs, %0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0aRaising a Prayer %0a%0a%0a%0a477 %0a%0a%0a%0aand two kidneys. These inner corrections of the body are meant for reception of %0athe Supernal spirit, Light, inside the body, and represent man's most important %0awork with regard to the Creator. %0a%0aThese inner actions are called Mitzvot. They depend on speech, such as a %0aprayer— supplications, blessings, and praises. And he who comes to know this %0awork is happy in all things. Man does not realize that his prayer permeates all %0athe Heavens, rising up to the very pinnacle of the universe and reaching the %0aCreator Himself. %0a%0aAs was repeatedly mentioned, not a single word in the Torah speaks of our %0aworld, especially not of our body. All the words in the Torah are the Creator's %0asacred names— the various sensations of the Creator felt by those who attain %0aHim. As we have explained, the attainment and sensation of the Creator is %0aimpossible without a screen, an altruistic intention, meaning that all that man %0adesires is to please his Creator. Only the sensations in the heart (the essence of %0aman) can perform this work, and never the physiological organs of our animate %0abody, which is no different from that of an animal. %0a%0aWhen the morning Light begins to shine, separating Light from darkness, %0aa call pierces through all the Heavens: prepare for the opening of entrances and %0achambers, and each go to your position. For the ones that serve at night are not the %0aones that serve in the daytime. And when the night comes, the daytime servants %0aare once more replaced by the nighttime ones. %0a%0aWhen the morning Light begins to shine— when man begins to realize that %0ahis egoistic desires are death and darkness, whereas altruism and spirituality are %0alife and Light, the Light within man thereby separates from darkness, and he %0abegins to analyze and realize his states, to feel spiritual ascents and descents— he %0afeels his proximity to the Creator as Light, while remoteness from Him and %0adescents into his egoistic desires feel like darkness. %0a%0aHowever, one can feel it only if he feels the Creator (even if only a little, %0aeven if indistinctly). To start feeling the shame of receiving from the Creator and %0ae insignificance of one's nature (the sensation of darkness), one must first feel %0ae Creator. Only His Light contains all that man needs: strength for correction, %0a■.sires, life. Hence, the main thing to which man must aspire is the sensation of %0a%0a%0a%0aThe forces that serve in the daytime are called the "rulers, the government of %0athe day," and the forces that serve at night are called the "rulers, the government %0aof the night." As soon as the morning call is heard, they all take their positions, %0a%0a%0a%0a478 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aMalchut and Israel descend and enter the Beit-Knesset (the House of Assembly— %0aa place, where all of man's wishes are collected; hence, it is called the house of %0aprayer) to exalt the Creator and begin their singing and blessings. %0a%0aIt is written: "We shall praise Your mercy in the morning and Your faith at %0anight." Feeling the Creator's Light descending upon him, man perceives it as %0amorning that comes after the darkness, and upon feeling such a state, he praises %0athe Creator in his heart. All alien thoughts retreat before the influence of the %0aCreator's Light, and all impure desires become restrained. %0a%0aAfter man has corrected himself in the positive Mitzvot (in the first part, %0ain the corrections of Tzitzit and Tefillin), he must unite all of his heart's desires %0ain inner work (in the second part), and wholeheartedly dedicate himself to the %0awork of praises, since speech rises upwards. %0a%0aIt is impossible to offer a brief explanation of the Mitzvot of Tefillin and %0aTzitzit, observed only by those who spiritually attained the level of Partzuf ZA. %0a%0aThese servants, who stood in their places in the air, are appointed to rule %0aover the four sides of the world. Gazaria soars in the air to govern the East, and %0aall the others that are appointed are together with him, and await the words of %0athe prayer that rises on that side from below. And this ruler takes the prayer. %0a%0aIf the words of a prayer are proper, then all these rulers absorb them and %0arise with them to the firmament, where the other rulers stand. Upon absorbing %0athese words, they proclaim, "Blessed be Israel. Blessed be the lips that utter %0athese words!" %0a%0aThe letters that were hanging in the air then fly up and form the holy %0aname that rules in the air and consists of twelve letters. This is the name by %0awhich Eliyahu flew before rising up to the sky. The letters fly up in the air, %0aand the ruler, who holds the keys to the air in his hand, rises to Heaven along %0awith all the other rulers, and pass the letters into the hands of another ruler %0afor further ascent. %0a%0aAfter Malchut had been separated from ZA, ZA filled himself with only Ohr %0aHassadim and became the right line, whereas Malchut formed the left line. These %0atwo lines are in conflict with one another, just as the right and the left lines of %0aBina oppose one another. This continues until ZA ascends to Bina as the middle %0aline, balances the right and the left lines, and makes peace between them by %0auniting them in a single, middle line. %0a%0aSimilarly, ZA and Malchut, the two opposite lines, need a middle line to %0abalance them, to bring them balance and peace, and to unite them. This occurs %0a%0a%0a%0aRaising a Prayer %0a%0a%0a%0a479 %0a%0a%0a%0awith the help of MAN (Mei Nukvin), the prayers of the righteous, for they offer %0aup the desires from this world. Also, the screen that they raise is called the %0aMasach (screen) de (of) Hirik— the middle line— causing the left and the right lines %0ato unite, and Malchut to unite with ZA. %0a%0aThus, a prayer becomes a request, MAN, and the middle line that leads to %0apeace and unity between ZA and Malchut. Just like Yesod Above (the middle line) %0aunites the Creator with the Shechina-Malchut by gathering all the created souls, %0aman's prayer creates the middle line and unites all by its ascent— bringing peace %0aand unity between the Creator and the Shechina (His creatures), the unity of %0asouls with their Creator. %0a%0aHence, just like the Sefira Yesod Above, man, too, is called Shalom (peace). %0aMoreover, the world below precedes and determines the world Above, for the %0aawakening from below (requests of the lower ones) precedes and evokes the %0aawakening from Above. %0a%0a%0a%0a- except 1 %0a%0aimagine derives only from these two spiritual forces. Man's desire is called a %0a"prayer," for intentionally or unintentionally, this desire appeals to the One %0awho created man, to the Creator. Spiritually, man develops in accordance %0a%0a%0a%0aw %0a%0a%0a%0aithh %0a%0a%0a%0ais prayer. %0a%0a%0a%0aHowever, one's true prayer is his request for spiritual correction and elevation. %0aSuch a prayer, a desire in the heart, can be achieved only by consistent study %0aof Kabbalistic sources, which affect man's egoistic desire with their concealed %0ainner Light, and evoke him to ascend spiritually ("Introduction to The Study of %0aTen Sefirot," item 155). %0a%0aA soul is none other than man's corrected, altruistic desire, his spiritual %0aPartzuf, his desire to receive the Creator's Light with the screen (intention) "for %0a%0a%0a%0aMan's speech in a prayer is none other than parts of his soul (the soul itself) %0aclothed in a body. A prayer is man's soul in this world, VAK de Nefesh of Malchut %0ade Malchut within Malchut de Assiya. %0a%0a%0a%0a480 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aWorld of AK %0aWorld of Atzilut %0aWorld of Beria %0aWorld ofYetzira %0aWorld of Assiya: Keter %0a%0a%0a%0aHochma %0a%0aBina %0a%0aZA %0a%0aMalchut=K + H + B + ZA+M %0a%0aK+H+B+ZA+M %0a%0aGAR + VAK = Soul of Man %0a%0a%0a%0aYet, how can one's prayer, his desire, rise through all the degrees of all %0athe worlds of BYA and reach Malchut de Atzilut so as to become MAN and the %0amiddle line, uniting Malchut with ZA? After all, it is well known that no degree %0acan rise above itself, let alone make such an incredible leap from the lowest %0adegree of the spiritual ladder (our world) to the world of Atzilut. %0a%0aTo understand that, we must first thoroughly understand the meaning of %0aMalchut's ascent to Bina. As a result of this ascent, each degree splits into two %0aparts: Keter and Hochma of each degree remain within it, while Bina, ZA, and %0aMalchut fall to a lower degree. This occurs because Malchut ascended to Bina and %0athereby created in Bina a new Sof (end) of the degree. This is because Malchut %0aexists under the prohibition of the first restriction, and hence cannot receive the %0aLight. Due to the second restriction, Bina, ZA, and Malchut are located below %0athe new Sof of the degree. Thus, being below Malchut that ascended to Bina, they %0aare defined as a lower degree. %0a%0a%0a%0aBina =Awzen %0a%0a%0a%0aZA = Hotem ) Together they are called AHP (Awzen-Hotem-Peh) %0a%0a%0a%0aMalchut = Peh %0a%0a%0a%0a%0aTogether they are called GE (Galgalta-Eynaim) %0a%0a%0a%0aParsa = Ascended Malchut %0a%0a%0a%0aRaising a Prayer %0a%0a%0a%0a481 %0a%0a%0a%0aAfterward, through the MAN raised by the lower ones, the Light AB-SAG %0adescends and gives strength to Malchut, which stands in Bina, to descend to her %0aown place: Malchut descends from Bina to her own place, thereby returning all %0athe Sefirot to their places and uniting them all into one degree, consisting of %0aten whole Sefirot. Consequently, Bina and ZON, which were below each degree, %0areturn to their degree, to their previous level. Thus, each degree restores itself %0aback to ten Sefirot. %0a%0aHowever, although Malchut, who stood in Bina as the new Sof (end) of the %0adegree, returns from Bina to her own place at the end of every ten Sefirot, this %0anew Sof that she created in Bina does not entirely vanish from Bina. As a result, %0aBina and ZON do not descend to their place. Instead, they must rise above the %0anew Sof and there create the left line with regard to Keter and Hochma, which %0anever fell from their degree and constitute the right line. %0a%0aThis is why the new Sof remains in its place in all the degrees even after %0aMalchut 's descent from Bina. And this Sof is called the "firmament," while Bina %0aand ZON, which fell from their degree, but now have returned to it, are called %0a"air." For each lower degree is defined as VAK (called Avir— air) with regard to %0athe Upper One. %0a%0a%0a%0aSince Bina and ZON fell from their degree, they became as VAK (air) with %0aregard to it, as the entire lower degree with regard to the Upper. And after %0athe descent of Malchut from Bina, the air (Bina and ZON) that was under the %0afirmament rises above it and becomes the left line. %0a%0aWhen Bina and ZON ascend above the firmament, they take with them %0athe lower degree, where they existed when they were below, and elevate it along %0awith them above the firmament. It is so because unlike our world, there are no %0aascents and descents in the spiritual; a descent constitutes the deterioration of %0aone's properties from one spiritual level to a lower one. %0a%0a%0a%0a%0aParsa (Firmament) - %0a%0a%0a%0a%0aBina %0a%0a%0a%0a= Awzen %0a%0a%0a%0aAHP (Air) %0a%0a%0a%0a482 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aHence, being equivalent in properties with the lower degree, when Bina and %0aZON ascend together, they take the entire lower degree along with them. For %0aafter being together once, and having become similar, they receive help, ascend, %0aand never part again. %0a%0aUltimately, Malchut's ascent to Bina forms an entrance, an opening, a gate %0afor the lower degree, through which it can ascend to the Upper One. Hence, %0awhen Malchut descends from Bina, thus allowing the lower part, AHP de Bina, to %0aascend, the lower degree can rise along with the ascending AHP de Bina. %0a%0a%0a%0aK %0a%0a%0a%0aGEof the Upper One %0a%0aFirmament %0a%0a%0a%0aB %0a%0aThe entire %0alevel ZA %0a%0aascends %0a%0aM %0a%0a%0a%0aK %0a%0a%0a%0aAHP of the Upper One (Air) %0a& GE of the Lower One %0a%0aLand or Earth of the Upper One %0a%0a%0a%0aZA / AHP of the Lower One %0a%0a%0a%0aM %0a%0a%0a%0aThus, as a result of Malchut's ascent to Bina and her subsequent descent due %0ato the influence of Ohr AB-SAG, three parts were formed in each degree: %0a%0a- Air, Bina and ZON that fell down; %0a%0a- The firmaments, the new ends of degrees that appeared through %0aMalchut's ascent to Bina. These never disappear, even if Malchut %0areturns to her place; %0a%0a- The entrances for the lower degrees that were formed through %0aMalchut's ascent to Bina, when the lower degree ascends along with %0aher. Without it, the lower degree can never reach the Upper One, for %0ano degree can ascend above itself. %0a%0aThis process is described in the Chassidic tales as the mission of a righteous %0aone (the Upper Degree) in our world: to descend to the most vile and corrupt %0apeople (the lower degree). In other words, while essentially remaining itself, %0athe Upper Degree should corrupt its properties so as to equalize with the lower %0a%0a%0a%0aRaising a Prayer %0a%0a%0a%0a483 %0a%0a%0a%0a:gree. Thus, it shows to the lower ones that in its desires, thoughts, and actions, %0ais the same as them. %0a%0aThen, when he completely unites with them, and they fully trust him, %0ae becomes "one of them" (designating the union of AHP of the Upper %0aith GE of the lower one), he gradually, inconspicuously or openly, begins to %0acorrect them— by his own example, he propagates his thoughts to them. These %0athoughts cannot be perceived from an outsider, but only from "one of their %0ahat is, the Upper One receives additional Light (strength) in its GE %0ale to raise its own AHP, correct its desires of reception, start wo %0a%0a%0a%0aAnd since there is no distinction between the desires of AHP of the Upper %0aOne and GE of the lower one, into which AHP of the Upper One fell, they both %0arise together. This way, the Upper One elevates, i.e., improves, corrects a certain %0apart of the lower one's properties (GE), and elevates them to its true level. %0a%0aTherefore, the most important thing in our state is to come to feel AHP of %0athe Upper Degree, located at the very center of our heart, and to become equal %0awith it in our properties so as to afterwards rise together with it. %0a%0aThis process is described in the book Attaining the Worlds Beyond, which %0aprovides a more personal perspective of this spiritual process: %0a%0aInside the internal sensations of the Kabbalist exists a part of the Higher %0aevel, of the future state (AHP). One who perceives a Higher Spiritual Level ; %0a1 unattractive vacuum, rather than a state full of Light, does not receive %0aler level. %0a%0aen though the Higher Level is full of Light, the lower level perceives %0a;r only to the degree that the lower qualities permit one to do so. Since the %0apresent qualities are not sufficient to receive the Higher Light, the individual %0adoes not perceive it. %0a%0aWe can perceive the Upper Level because all the spiritual steps are arranged %0asequentially from lowest to highest. Moreover, the subsequent states overlap %0ath one another; the lower half of the Higher state is situated within the Upper %0aer state (AHP of Upper falls into GE of lower). %0a%0a, the lowest part of our Upper State is always present within us, %0ausually not felt by us. The Upper State above us is referred to as "the Creator" %0afunctions as the Creator for us. %0a%0a%0a%0a%0aIt gives birth to us and it gives us life and guidance. Since we do not ha %0a%0a%0a%0a484 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0aiin over al %0afreely. %0a%0acan see only One Truth, %0arates in everything and in everyone. %0a%0aSince the Will of the Creator is to grant each human being a free will, then %0athe concealment of the Creator from His creations is necessary. Only if He is %0ahidden can we argue that we can aspire of our free will to attach ourselves to the %0aCreator— to act for His sake, without any trace of self-interest. %0a%0ale entire process of self-correction is possible only when the Crea %0alied from us. As soon as He reveals Himself to us we immediately 1 %0aservants and fall into the control of His thought, grandeur and pc %0a%0athat point, it is impossible to determine what our true thoi %0arder to allow us to act freely, the Creator has to conceal Hir %0a%0aOn the other hand, to give us a chance to break free from the blind slave %0aof egoism, the Creator must reveal Himself. This is so because a human being %0aobeys only two forces in this world: the force of egoism— the body— and the force %0aof the Creator— altruism. %0a%0aIt follows, then, that alternating the two states is necessary. These states are %0athe concealment of the Creator from us when we perceive only ourselves and %0athe egoistic forces governing us, and the revelation of the Creator when %0apower of the spiritual forces. %0a%0al order for one who is still under the influence of egoism to percei %0aUpper Object (the Creator), the Creator must equalize some of His %0aqualities with those of the lower being— the person seeking a connection with %0athe Creator. %0a%0aHe will endow some of His altruistic qualities with egoistic attributes, and %0acan then come into balance with the person seeking connection with Him. %0a%0aThe Upper Part elevates the Malchut-Midat HaDin to the level of His Galgalta %0ave Eynaim. As a result, His AHP acquires egoistic qualities. In this manner, His %0aAHP "descends" to the lower part (the spiritual level of the seeker) and comes %0ainto a state of equivalence with the qualities of the lower part. %0a%0aInitially the lower part was not able to perceive the Upper Spiritual State. %0aHowever, because the Creator hid His highest altruistic qualities behind egoistic %0aones, He was able to descend to the level of the person so that the person was %0a%0a%0a%0athe ego: %0athe pow %0a%0aIn ( %0a%0aclosest %0a%0a%0a%0aves and %0awe feel %0a%0a%0a%0aRaising a Prayer %0a%0a%0a%0a485 %0a%0a%0a%0athat %0aa the %0a%0a%0a%0a%0are or %0a%0a%0a%0ase we perceive higher qualities as being egoistic, we are unable to truly %0aessence. It appears that there is nothing positive in the spiritual tha %0aasure, inspiration, confidence, or tranquility. %0a%0aprecisely at this point that we have an opportunity to exercise %0allpower. We may, instead, declare that the absence of pleasure and taste in %0aspiritual and in Kabbalah is because of the Creator's deliberate concealment for %0aour own sake. Because we do not yet possess the necessary spiritual qualities, it %0ais therefore impossible for us to perceive the Upper spiritual pleasures; rather, %0aour earthly desires are governed by egoism. %0a%0atied for beginners to understand that they are given depression %0a%0am. %0a%0arelief to the Creator, they may study, or %0at such people do not experience pleasure %0aaspirations is directed from Above. %0a%0aThis gives them the free will to conclude that their lack of pleasure comes %0afrom a lack of appropriate altruistic qualities in themselves. Hence, the Upper %0aOne must hide His true qualities from them. %0a%0aTherefore, we must remember that the first stage of perceiving the spiritual %0ais the feeling of spiritual deprivation. If the lower part is capable of realizing that %0athe Upper One is concealing Himself because of their incongruity of qualities, %0aand if that lower part asks for help to correct its own egoism by raising a p %0a(MAN), then the Upper Part partially reveals Himself (lifts His AHP) and display: %0aHis true qualities, which prior to this moment, were disguised beneath egi %0a%0aAs a result, spiritual pleasure also becomes apparent. Thus, the lower part %0abegins to experience the grandeur and the spiritual pleasure felt by the Higher %0aBeing, Who possesses spiritual altruistic qualities. %0a%0aBecause the Upper Part elevated His altruistic qualities in the eyes of the %0aindividual, He thus elevated the individual to the middle of His State (He lifted %0aGE of the lower together with His own AHP). %0a%0aThis spiritual state is known as a person's "lesser spiritual level" (Katnut). %0ae Upper Part, in a way, elevates the lower part to His own spiritual level by %0aing both His grandeur and the grandeur of altruistic qualities. By seeing %0amagnificence of the spiritual and comparing it to the material, we may %0aally rise above our world. %0a%0aen we perceive the spiritual, regardless of our will, our egoistic qualities %0aged into altruistic ones, that is, into the qualities of the Creator. In %0a%0a%0a%0a486 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0a%0aow the lower part to take complete possession of the Higher %0apper Part wholly reveals Himself and all His qualities to that lc %0ag He reveals his Grandeur, makes Gadlut. %0a%0apoint, the person perceives the Upper Part as the One anc %0aovereign of everything in the universe. At the same time, the %0apart grasps the highest knowledge of the purpose of creation and %0aUpper's dominion. %0a%0aIt becomes clear to the lower part that there is no other way to conduct %0aoneself than in the way prescribed by Kabbalah. Thus, the lower part's reason %0anow requires proper action. As a result of this clear awareness of the Creator, %0aone must deal with the contradiction between faith and knowledge, between %0aright and the left lines. %0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0aNow, having acquired altruistic qualities (Katnut), the lower part prefers to %0a)roceed only by means of faith in the strength of the Creator. This serves as %0aication of the seeker's sincere desire to come closer to the Cres %0a%0a;r, the Creator's revelation of His grandeur (Gadlut) nov %0aadvancing by faith. Consequently, the individual must willing %0ase with the acquired knowledge. %0a%0alen one pleads to proceed blindly, relying only on one's faith %0amagnificence of the Creator, rather than by realizing His power and grandeur, %0aand only by using reason in proportion to one's faith, the Creator is compelled %0ato limit His disclosure. When such an action compels the Creator to diminish %0aHis disclosure of His general dominion, His omnipotence, and His Light (Ohr %0aHochma), this is called "the screen of Hirik." %0a%0aThrough this screen, we are able to diminish the revelation of the Upper %0areason (the left line) to the point at which this revelation can be balanced with %0athe right line. The correct correlation between faith and knowledge %0a"spiritual balance," %0a%0aidividuals, determir %0alith and knowledg %0athe middle line." %0a%0aaled knowledge (the left line) that ' %0aour faith (the right line), by proceeding by faith above reason (the middle line) %0aadded onto those spiritual qualities that we possessed before, in the state of Katn %0aThe newlv acquired spiritual level is known as Gadlut, %0a%0a%0a%0a%0aig big ; %0a%0a%0a%0aV? %0a%0a%0a%0aRaising a Prayer %0a%0a%0a%0a487 %0a%0a%0a%0aAfter the first complete spiritual level has been attained, we will bee %0aequal in qualities to the very first (the lowest) state of the spiritual ladder, %0amentioned earlier, all the states, or steps of the ladder, overlap with each ot %0a%0aHaving reached the first level, we may discover the presence of a hi %0alevel within us. Using the same principle as when advancing to the first level, we %0acan proceed step by step to the goal of creation— complete unification with the %0aCreator on the Highest level. %0a%0aAn essential part of our spiritual ascent is a special process that requires %0athat, on discovering a greater evil within us, we ask the Creator to grant us the %0atrength to overcome that evil. We then receive strength in the form of a greate %0airitual Light. %0a%0aThis continues until we actually reach the original level and size o %0auls: at that point, our egoism is completely corrected and filled with Light. %0a%0aen we are distracted by outside thoughts, we feel that thoughts obs %0am ascertaining the spiritual, because our strength and minds are wasted on %0aextraneous concerns, while our hearts become filled with petty desires. At times %0alike this, we lose faith in the fact that only the Kabbalah contains the true life. %0a%0aOnce we overcome this condition, we come out of our state and move into %0athe Light, receiving a Higher Light that helps us ascend further. In this manner, %0aour extraneous thoughts work to help us in our spiritual advancement. %0a%0aWe can overcome obstacles only with the help of the Creator. We can only %0aork on something if we perceive some personal benefit in the task. However, %0aodies, hearts and intellects do not understand what benefits can result %0aism. %0a%0aTherefore, as soon as we try to make even the slightest altruistic move, we lose %0aall strength of the mind, heart and body. We are left with nothing else but to turn %0ato the Creator and ask Him for help. In this way, unwillingly and without any free %0achoice, we advance toward the Creator until we merge with Him completely. %0a%0aThe lower half of the Higher spiritual object is found within the Upper half %0aof the lower spiritual object. In the lower object, the screen (Masach) is found in %0ae eye area. This is known as "spiritual blindness," because in such a state only %0a; lower half of the Higher object is visible to us, since the screen of the lower %0airitual object conceals part of the Higher spiritual object. %0a%0aigher spiritual object drops its screen to the lower one, then reveals itself %0ato the lower object, which in turn begins to view the Higher object as the Higher %0aOne views itself. As a result, the lower object receives the state of fullness (Gadlut). %0a%0a%0a%0a%0a488 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aer object, then, sees that the Higher One is in a "great" state, and %0aigher object's prior concealment and apparent manifestation as %0alall" state (Katnut), was done exclusively for the benefit of the lower one. In i %0athe lower object could become aware of the importance of the Higher 1 %0a%0aA person in the right line (Kav Yamin) is happy with his lot (Chafetz Hesed). %0aThis is called a "small spiritual state" (Katnut), because a person feels no need %0afor the Torah. He does not feel evil, egoism within himself, and without the %0aneed for self-correction, he needs no Torah. %0a%0aHence, he needs the left line {Kav Smol). He has to critically appraise his stat %0a(Heshbon Nefesh), decide what he wants from the Creator and from himself, ar %0a;r he understands the Torah and advances toward the goal of creatic %0ale sees his genuine state and is obliged to integrate it in the right line, %0aother words, he has to be content with what he has and be pleased with his sta %0aas if he has everything that he wishes. %0a%0aIn the left line, which brings about suffering as a result of the absence of %0athe desired, a need is awakened for the help of the Creator, which comes in the %0aform of Light of the soul. %0a%0aIn the right line, in a state when a person desires nothing for the self, there %0aexists only the Light of Mercy (Ohr Hassadim), the joy from the similarity in %0aspiritual qualities. But this state is not perfect, because it lacks knowledge and %0athe understanding of the inner meaning. In the left line there is no perfect %0abecause the Light of Wisdom can illuminate only if there is con %0aqualities between the Light received and the recipient of the Light. %0a%0aThe congruence results in Ohr Hassadim, which is found in the right li %0aSpiritual gains can be made only by having a desire. But the right line has no %0adesire for anything. All the desires are concentrated in the left line.

How can this Upper Partzuf descend to %0a%0a%0a%0aRaising a Prayer %0a%0a%0a%0a489 %0a%0a%0a%0ahim? Only by equalizing one's desires (properties) with it. All of man's thoughts %0aand desires (or lack thereof), with regard to the spiritual, constitute his contact %0awith the Upper One. When man feels a lack of desire for spirituality, it means %0athat the Upper Partzuf descended and entered him, equalized itself with him; %0ahence, man feels spiritual emptiness. %0a%0aIt is precisely in this state of not being drawn to the spiritual that man %0ashould tell himself that it only seems to him this way, whereas in truth, by faith %0aabove reason, he desires and acts for the sake of nearing the spiritual. In other %0awords, if, in the state when the Upper One "falls" (spiritual values lose their %0asignificance) in his eyes, one can nonetheless aspire to spirituality, he thereby %0abinds, connects himself to AHP of the Upper One. This is because AHP of the %0aUpper One deliberately degraded its properties and assumed an outward form %0asimilar to the properties (desires) of man. %0a%0aTherefore, as soon as one can establish contact with AHP of the Upper One %0a(even if it appears to him absolutely unattractive, precisely because it lowers its %0aproperties to man's level), this AHP of the Upper One immediately elevates %0aman to its GE. Thus, man ascends to a Higher Degree. %0a%0a"Piercing through the air" means that the air boundary, consisting of Bina %0aand ZON of the Upper Degree, created as a result of Malchut's ascent to Bina, is %0apierced by Malchut's descent from Bina to her place, for then the air rises above %0athe firmament and reaches GAR (GE) of the degree. %0a%0aThus occurs the piercing of the firmaments. For the firmaments constitute %0athe borders of new ends, which appeared because the air (Bina and ZON) was %0apushed off from its own degree to a lower one, and was not allowed to return %0ato its degree. Hence, the firmament is pierced from Malchut's descent, and no %0alonger prevents Bina and ZON from ascending and joining that degree. %0a%0a%0a%0aK %0a%0a%0a%0aGE of the Upper one %0a%0a%0a%0aH %0a%0a%0a%0aFirmament %0a%0a%0a%0aB %0a%0a%0a%0aZA %0a%0a%0a%0aK %0a%0a%0a%0aAHP of Upper one (Air) + GE of Lower one %0a%0a%0a%0aM %0a%0a%0a%0aH %0a%0a%0a%0aB %0a%0a%0a%0aZA %0a%0a%0a%0aAHP of of the Lower one %0a%0a%0a%0aM %0a%0a%0a%0a490 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0a1. Malchut ascended to Bina = firmament. %0a%0a2. Malchut descends back. This creates a passage for AHP to its GE. Thus, %0athe entrances for the lower degree are opened: due to Malchut's descent to her %0aplace and the piercing through the firmaments, Bina and ZON ascend to a %0aHigher Degree above the firmament together with the lower degree that they %0awere with during their descent. %0a%0aIn other words, the Upper One deliberately opened up the entrances to %0aenable the lower degree to ascend to a Higher Degree, and not for Bina and %0aZON (AHP of the Upper One), who simply return to their place. %0a%0aThe Light that lowers Malchut from Bina to her own place at the end of the %0aten Sefirot stems from Partzufim AB-SAG. These are the Partzufim Hochma and %0aBina of the world of AK. Although the second restriction— Malchut's ascent to %0aBina— occurred in Partzuf Bina of the world of AK, the Partzufim Bina (SAG) and %0aHochma (AB) of the world of AK were unaffected by it, and Malchut remains in %0aher place at the end of the ten Sefirot. %0a%0aOnly the Creator Himself, meaning the properties of the Light, can correct %0aand transform man's egoistic properties to altruistic. Indeed, man is simply %0aunable to pull himself out of his current state "by his own hair," as from birth %0ahe has absolutely no spiritual strength (desires). Hence, only the Upper Light %0acorrect him. And it can only be Ohr Hochma, for this is the Light tl %0aitor emanates. Ohr Hochma, unrestricted by Tzimtzum Bet, is locatec %0a%0aTherefore, when one raises his MAN (prayer), it reaches the Highest %0aPartzufim of the world of Atzilut, which turn to SAG-Bina-Ima (mother), who %0ain turn appeals to AB-Hochma-Aba (father), receives Ohr Hochma from him and %0apasses it to her children— the souls of the righteous, those who wish to become %0arighteous and to ascend spiritually. %0a%0aHence, when HochmaAB unites with Bina-SAG in the world of AK, this %0aLight (Ohr AB-SAG) descends from Partzuf Bina de AK to Partzuf Bina de Atzilut, %0acalled EKYEH = Ale£>h-He;y-Yo%3ciHe;y. Partzuf Bina de Atzilut sends the Light to all %0athe degrees of the worlds of BYA. Upon attaining a particular Partzuf, this Light %0alowers the Malchut of each degree (that ascended to Bina) from the degree of %0aBina to her previous place. %0a%0aStarting with AVI, all the Partzufim are in the state of Katnut: AHP of the %0aUpper Partzuf is inside GE of the lower one. The received Ohr Hochma descends %0ato him who raised MAN, thus evoking Gadlut in all the Partzufim, through which %0a%0a%0a%0aRaising a Prayer %0a%0a%0a%0a491 %0a%0a%0a%0athe Light descends to him. The Light descends to each Partzuf along his personal %0apath, which is precisely what connects everyone, each soul, to the Creator. %0a%0aWorld of AK %0a%0aKeter - Galgalta %0aHochma-AB %0aBina - SAG %0a%0aZA-MAEIyon %0a%0aMalchut - BON Elyon %0a%0aWorld of Atzilut %0a%0aKeter -Atik %0a%0aHochma-AA %0a%0aBina- AVI = EKYEH %0aZA %0a%0aMalchut %0a%0aWorld of Beria %0aWorld of Yetzira %0aWorld of Assiya %0aOur World %0a%0aThis is why the name EKYEH is referred to as the ruler of air that moves the %0aboundary of air because of Malchut 's descent from Bina to her previous place. %0aEach degree and each world consists of four Sefirot H-B-ZA-M, each of which %0aConsists of its own individual ten Sefirot, where, as a result of Malchut's ascent to %0aBina in each degree, Bina-ZA-Malchut of each degree fell to a lower degree. %0a%0aThus, there are four kinds of airspace in each world that are governed by %0athe three names of EKYEH: EKYEH in the air of Hesed, EKYEH in the air of %0aGevura, and EKYEH in the air of Tifferet. Malchut receives from them, and all %0athree names govern in her air together. %0a%0aThe triple name, EKYEH, comprises twelve letters. This twelve-letter name %0arules in the air by lowering Malchut from Bina to her previous place, returning %0aBina and ZON (called "air"), who fell to a lower degree, back to the degree above %0athe firmament. For Malchut's ascent to Bina created an entrance, to enable the %0a%0a%0a%0aThese Partzufim %0achannel the Light of %0aAB-SAG from %0aSAG of AK %0a%0adown to AVI de Atzilut %0a%0a%0a%0a492 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0alower one rise to the Upper Degree as soon as it opens, i.e., during Malchut's %0areturn to her place. %0a%0aHence, when the prophet Eliyahu (a particular spiritual degree) wished to %0asoar to the sky, Malchut of each degree ascended to Bina of the corresponding %0adegree, while Bina and ZON of this degree fell to the lower degree, and a %0afirmament was formed between them. It turned out that each degree doubled: %0anow it contained its own degree, as well as Bina and ZON of the Upper Degree, %0awho fell and clothed the lower degree. %0a%0aThis occurred at each degree of the worlds of ABYA, down to the lowest %0aone: Bina and ZON of the Sefira Malchut of the world of Assiya fell and emerged %0ain our world below Malchut. Malchut de Assiya ends at its firmament, which is a %0anew end, in Bina. Also, this degree doubled, as Bina and ZON of the Sefira Yesod %0aof the world of Assiya fell and clothed in its degree. %0a%0a%0a%0aGEde Bina %0aof the World of Atzilut %0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0aAHP de Bina %0a%0a%0aGEdeZA %0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0aAHPdeZA %0a%0a%0aGE de Malchut %0a%0a%0a%0a%0aParsa %0a%0a%0aParsa %0a%0a%0a%0a%0aAHP de Malchut %0a%0a%0aGE de Keter of the World of Beria %0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0aAHP de Keter %0a%0a%0aGE de Hochma %0a%0a%0a%0aetc. %0a%0a%0a%0aGE de Bina %0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0aof the World of Assiya %0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0aMachsom %0a%0a%0aAHP de Bina %0a%0a%0aGEdeZA %0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0aAHPdeZA %0a%0a%0aGE de Malchut of the World of Assiya %0a%0a%0a/ %0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0aAHPde Malchut %0a%0a%0a(GE) of the Human Soul %0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0ain our World %0a%0a%0a%0aIn the diagram, GE of man in our world are put in brackets, for he who %0aexists (spiritually, not with his body) at the degree of our world has no desires of %0abestowal. Hence, it is said that he who exists with his properties in this world, %0ain egoism, has only a point in his heart, from which he can start his spiritual %0adevelopment. %0a%0aSimilarly, the Sefira Yesod of the world of Assiya also ends with its firmament %0aand contains Bina and ZON of the Sefira Hod de Assiya. The Sefira Netzah de %0aAssiya also doubled, and so on up to Bina de Atzilut. This is why the prophet %0aEliyahu rose up and united with Bina and ZON, who fell from Malchut de Assiya %0a%0a%0a%0aRaising a Prayer %0a%0a%0a%0a493 %0a%0a%0a%0ato this world. He equalized with them and clothed in them, whereupon they %0abecame like him— reached his degree. %0a%0aNot all ten Sefirot of the world of Assiya are shown in the above diagram, %0abut as it was previously mentioned, each degree is divided into its own GE and %0aAHP. Man's task is to find AHP of the Upper One within him, and connect to %0ait, merge with it in all of his sensations and desires. %0a%0aSubsequently, the twelve-letter name exerted its influence (thanks to the %0aLight AB-SAG), causing Malchut de Assiya to descend from Bina of Malchut de %0aAssiya to its place, Malchut de Malchut, the end of the ten Sefirot. And as before, %0aBina and ZON ascended to their degree above the firmament of Malchut. And %0asince Eliyahu's properties were already merged with this air (with the ascending %0aBina and ZON), he rose together with them above the firmament of Malchut, as %0ahe was similar to them. %0a%0a%0a%0aetc. %0a%0a%0a%0aGE de Hochma %0aof the World of Assiya %0a%0a"ahp" %0a%0a%0a%0aGE de Bina %0aAHP de Bina %0a%0a%0a%0aSefira Yesod %0a%0aof the World of Assiya %0a%0a%0a%0aGEdeZA %0aAHPdeZA %0a%0a%0a%0aSefira Malchut %0aof the World of Assiya %0a%0a%0a%0aGE de Malchut %0aAHP "de Malc"hut|(GE) of the Human Soul in our World %0a%0a%0a%0aAnd since he rose above the firmament of Malchut de Assiya, he entered the %0aair (AHP) of Yesod de Assiya, i.e., Bina and ZON of Yesod that fell down there. %0aThen he merged in his desires with this air and is considered to have clothed in %0ait, for they were previously at the same degree. Then the influence of the twelve- %0aletter name lowered Malchut from Bina of Yesod de Assiya to her place at the end %0aof the ten individual Sefirot of Yesod de Assiya. %0a%0aAfter that, Bina and ZON (the air of Yesod) ascended above the firmament %0aof Yesod. And since Eliyahu had already merged with this air, he (man's soul, his %0adesire) too ascended above the firmament of Yesod de Assiya, due to his concord %0awith them. %0a%0aAnd because he rose above the firmament of Yesod de Assiya, he met with %0athe air (AHP) of Hod de Assiya, i.e., Bina and ZON of Hod de Assiya that fell down %0athere. Subsequently, he merged in his desires with this air and clothed it, for %0athey were previously at the same place (spiritually similar to one another). %0a%0a%0a%0a494 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aAs soon as man merges in his properties with AHP of the Upper One, the %0ainfluence of the twelve-letter name (the descent of the Light of AB-SAG from %0aAbove) brings Malchut back (gives strength to the screen) to the end of the ten %0aindividual Sefirot of Hod de Assiya. And the air, its Bina and ZON, returned to %0atheir place above the firmament of Hod de Assiya. They took Eliyahu (man's soul, %0ahis desires) with them, for he had merged with them, and they elevated him to %0athe firmament of Hod de Assiya in view of his similarity with them. %0a%0aAnd when he was already in the firmament of Hod de Assiya, he met with %0athe air (AHP) of Netzah de Assiya and merged with it in his properties. When the %0ainfluence of the twelve-letter name (the Light of correction, AB-SAG, that was sent %0aby the Creator) brought Malchut back to her place (Malchut descended from Bina %0ato Malchut of this Sefira, because she received strength from the Light to resist %0athe egoistic desires of AHP and make them altruistic), the air of Netzah ascended %0aabove the firmament, and being merged with Eliyahu (man's soul), took him with %0ait. Being already in the firmament of Net^ah, he met with the air of Tifferet and so %0aon, until he ascended with this air above the firmament of Tifferet de Assiya. %0a%0aIn the same way, the air (AHP) of each degree rose higher, up to the Highest %0aDegree of the world of Assiya. From there, it rose to Malchut de Yetzira, and from %0athere— one step at a time— along all the degrees of the world of Yet^zra and the %0aworld of Beria, up to the Heavens (ZA) of the world of Atzilut. %0a%0aIt is therefore said about the prophet Eliyahu that the Creator's spirit %0a(the Light AB-SAG) elevated him (merged with AHP of the Upper One) to the %0aHeavens: spirit means Ruach, Sefirot Bina and ZON of the Upper Degree, called %0a"air," that fell down to the lower degree. And this air (spirit) elevates one from %0aa lower degree to a Higher One through all the individual degrees, from the %0alowest degree (So/ de Assiya) up to the world of Atzilut. %0a%0aAn Upper Degree is regarded as the Creator of the lower degree: it creates %0ait, vitalizes it with Light, and governs it. At each degree, man considers the next %0aHighest spiritual degree with regard to him as the Creator. As Rabbi Zushe said: %0a"Every day I have a new Creator." In other words, as man ascends to a Higher %0aDegree (which he calls "day" or "Light"), he thereby reveals a new property of %0athe Creator in this Higher Degree. %0a%0aThe air of each of the four sides of the world (in Sefirot Hesed-Gevura-Tifferet- %0aMalchui) has its own rulers, who hold the keys to the activation of the twelve- %0aletter name so as to lower Malchut from Bina to her own place. The ascending %0aorder of these four kinds of air is as follows: West-Malchut, East-Ti//eret (including %0aNHY), North-Gei/ura, and South-Hesed. %0a%0a%0a%0aRaising a Prayer %0a%0a%0a%0a495 %0a%0a%0a%0aHesed %0a%0a%0a%0a- SOUTH %0a%0a%0a%0aGevura %0a%0a%0a%0aNORTH %0a%0a%0a%0aZA %0a%0a%0a%0a- EAST %0a%0a%0a%0aMalchut - WEST %0a%0a%0a%0aIt is not the rulers that raise a prayer (the desire that man feels in the very %0adepths of his heart) from air to air, and then from firmament to firmament. %0aThe air raises a prayer from the firmament, each air to its firmament: first, the %0aprayer ascends to the air of the Sefira Malchut de Assiya, i.e., to Bina and ZON %0a(AHP) that fell from Malchut de Assiya down to our world. They resemble the %0aprayer itself, for this air (AHP) is similar to a prayer (the Upper One lowered %0aitself deliberately to equalize its properties with the lower one); hence, they %0amerge as one degree. %0a%0aThen the one that rules there, Zvuliel (Zebuliel), activates the twelve-letter %0aname, which lowers Malchut from Bina de Assiya to her place. This causes the %0aair to return to its degree and rise above the firmament of the world of Assiya. %0aAnd since the air became similar to the degree of the actual prayer, it also takes %0athe prayer along with it, raising it above the firmament of the Sefira Malchut de %0aAssiya. This is similar to the ascent of Prophet Eliyahu. %0a%0aAnd since the prayer ascended to the firmament of the world of Assiya, it %0ameets the air of Yesod de Assiya that fell there, as in the case of Eliyahu. It also %0aencounters the ruler of the air of the East, Gazaria (Gazardiel), because East %0adesignates the Sefira Tifferet (ZA is often called Tifferet, as the properties of this %0aSefira dominate and determine all the properties of ZA), which includes the %0aSefira Yesod, for Tifferet includes Sefirot NHY. %0a%0aThis ruler activates the twelve-letter name and lowers Malchut from Bina %0ade Yesod to her place, which causes the air of Yesod to ascend to its degree, %0athe firmament of Yesod. By merging with the prayer into one degree via %0aequivalence of form, he takes it with him and raises it above the firmament %0aof Yesod. Then, a similar action occurs in the air and firmament of Sefirot %0aNetzah, Hod, and Tifferet. %0a%0aSince the prayer ascended to the firmament of Tifferet, it encounters the %0aNorthern air, i.e., Bina and ZON of Gevura de Assiya that fell there. There it %0aunites with this air into one degree. Then the ruler of the North, Petachia %0a(Petahyah), activates the twelve-letter name and lowers Malchut from Bina to her %0aplace. Consequently, the air returns, ascends to the firmament of Gevura and %0atakes with it the prayer, which merged with it into one degree during its fall. %0a%0a%0a%0a496 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aSince the prayer has already reached the firmament of Gevura, it meets with %0athe Southern air, Bina and ZON of Hesed de Assiya that fell there, and merges %0awith this air. Then the ruler of the Southern air, named Pisgania (Pesagniyah), %0aHesed de Assiya, activates the twelve-letter name and lowers Malchut from Bina of %0aHesed de Assiya to her place. The Southern air returns and ascends to its degree %0ain the sixth firmament, Hesed de Assiya, called "south." %0a%0aSince the prayer has reached the sixth firmament, it encounters the air that %0afell from the seventh firmament, which is Bina that includes GAR, and the prayer %0amerges with this air into one degree. When the twelve-letter name lowers Malchut %0afrom Bina (the seventh firmament) to her place, the air returns to its degree (the %0aseventh firmament) and takes the prayer with it, as they merge during its fall. %0a%0aSince the prayer has reached the seventh firmament, it encounters the air %0athat fell from Malchut de Yetzira, and merges with it. Next, the general ruler, %0aSandalphon, who governs the entire world of Assiya, takes it and activates the %0atwelve-letter name, which lowers Malchut from Malchut de Yetzira to her place. %0aAnd the air ascends and returns to its degree, the firmament of Malchut de Yetzira, %0atakes the prayer with it, and elevates it to the firmament of Malchut de Yetzira. %0a%0aIn exactly the same way, the prayer ascends through all seven Heichalot %0a(halls) of the worlds Yetzira and Beria up to the world of Atzilut. This clarifies %0athe question posed in the beginning: how can a prayer ascend from the very %0alowest degree of the world of Assiya to the world of Atzilut, for no degree can %0aascend above itself? From the aforesaid, it follows that since the prayer merges %0awith the first air that fell from Malchut de Assiya to our world, it is exactly this %0aair that elevated them to the firmament of Malchut, whereas the air of Yesod %0ade Assiya was elevated to the firmament of Yesod, and so forth. In other words, %0athe air with which the prayer merges and ascends elevates it to Malchut of the %0aworld of Atzilut. %0a%0aHe who falls from Malchut de Assiya to our world descends from the spiritual %0adegree called Malchut de Assiya to the spiritual degree called our world. Of course, %0athis in no way refers to the physical existence in our world. AHP of the Upper %0aDegree are considered fallen when one feels in his heart (in the center of all of %0ahis desires) the desire to attain the spiritual, merge with it, and annul his egoistic %0aproperties because they harm and impede his advancement. %0a%0aOne should not think that the fall of Bina and ZON to our world from the %0aworld of Assiya can be experienced by anyone. And only he who felt this way %0aand was then able to make a sufficient amount of quantitative and qualitative %0aefforts, merits being elevated above our world by AHP of the Upper One. %0a%0a%0a%0aRaising a Prayer %0a%0a%0a%0a497 %0a%0a%0a%0aOn the Southern side (Hesed), there is he who governs the air of that side, %0aand his assistants. His name is Pisgania, and he holds the keys to the air of %0athis side. All those who suffer pray to their Creator from the depths of their %0abroken hearts (the very sensation of suffering constitutes a prayer, and requires %0ano words). If their speech (desires) is worthy, it ascends to the air of this side, %0aand the ruler accepts and kisses it ("embrace," "kiss," and Zivug are forms of %0aspiritual union of Partzufim), and then declares: "The Creator will be merciful %0aand will spare you in His mercy." %0a%0aAll of the holy rulers (Ohr Hochma is called holy) and their assistants of that %0aside rise together with him. The letters of the Creator's holy name, of the twelve- %0aletter name EKYEH soar: four letters Aleph-Hey-Yod-Hey on each side, which %0arule the corresponding sides of air. They ascend on this side of the air to the %0aSouthern firmament, Hesed (the sixth firmament), to the ruler of the firmament %0aof the Southern side, named Anafiel. %0a%0aOn the Northern side (Gevura) there is Petachia, who governs the air with %0ahis assistants. If he who prays for his enemies and haters, i.e., for those who %0amake him suffer is righteous, then as the speech of his prayer rises to the air %0aof that side, the ruler accepts his heart's speech and kisses it (unites it with his %0aproperties so as to raise it higher). %0a%0aThe air that comes from the North stirs and calls upon all the firmaments, %0aand they all take this speech, raise it to the Northern, fifth firmament, kiss %0ait and say: "The Lord will cast your enemies down and take them away from %0ayour face." This occurs in the following order: after the governor of the air had %0aaccepted the prayer and kissed it, which means that it merged with the degree %0aof the air and the ruler, the air stirs on the Northern side (the new end that %0aMalchut made as she ascended to Bina, called Techum— space, from the word %0aTohu— chaos), and the twelve-letter name lowers Malchut from Bina of Gevura de %0aAssiya back to her place. %0a%0aThe air that fell into the restrictions (Dinim) of this space is aroused by %0athe desire to rise to the firmament of Gevura. Also, all the degrees that merged %0awith it during its fall rise along with it to the firmament of Gevura due to their %0asimilarity to it. Similarly, the prayer that was merged with it during its fall ascends %0aalong with it to the fifth firmament. %0a%0aThe order of the ascent (offering up of a prayer) starts from here: it ascends %0aand pierces through the air (AHP), which fell from Malchut de Assiya to our %0aworld, and ascends with it to the first firmament, the firmament of Malchut de %0aAssiya. The prayer ascends and approaches the ruler (in its properties), who was %0a%0a%0a%0a498 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aappointed to control the Western side, Malchut. There are nine entrances where %0athe assistants to the ruler, Zvuliel stand. %0a%0aThe ten Sefirot of Malchut herself have nine (not ten) entrances, for a %0arestriction to receive the Light is imposed on Malchut of the Sefira Malchut, and %0ait is connected to Yesod de Malchut. Hence, Yesod and Malchut of Malchut share %0athe same entrance. %0a%0aHowever, a question arises: "Why do all the parts of the air have one ruler for %0athe air and a separate ruler for the firmament? For example, on the Eastern side %0aGazaria controls the Eastern air and Shimshiel controls the Eastern firmament %0a(Tifferet, the fourth firmament). Similarly, Pisgania controls the Southern air on %0athe Southern side, and Anafiel controls the Southern firmament. And on the %0aNorthern side, the ruler Petachia governs the Northern air, and Gadriel is in %0acharge of the Northern firmament. So why does only Malchut have one general %0aruler, called Zvuliel, who governs both the air and the firmament?" %0a%0aThe reason is that due to Malchut's ascent to Bina, Bina and ZON of each %0adegree fall to a lower degree, the degree of air. However, only the lower part of %0aBina (ZAT or VAK de Bina) falls, whereas Keter, Hochma, and the Upper half of %0aBina (GAR de Bina) remain at the same degree. Only the lower half of Bina, ZAT %0ade Bina (ZA and Malchut) fell from this degree and became air. %0a%0a%0a%0aKeter %0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0aGE %0a%0a%0aHochma %0a%0a%0aq- GAR of Bina %0aBina ZATofB~ina %0a%0a%0a— Parsa = Malchut — %0a%0a%0aZA %0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0aAHP %0a%0a%0aMalchut %0a%0a%0a%0aTherefore, two separate rulers were needed: one for the Upper Degree %0aremaining above the firmament, and the other— for the lower half of the degree %0athat fell and turned into air. The degree (ten Sefirot) of Malchut, from whom %0aall nine lower Sefirot fell to the lower degree during Malchut's ascent to Bina, %0aretained only one Sefira Keter de Malchut, which remained as a point below %0aYesod de ZA. %0a%0aNevertheless, even this point refers more to the Sefira Yesod, which is superior %0ato Malchut, because its properties are more similar to Yesod. And since all of %0a%0a%0a%0aRaising a Prayer %0a%0a%0a%0a499 %0a%0a%0a%0aMalchut refers to the properties of air (except for her individual Keter), she has %0aonly one ruler. %0a%0aThe ruler wishes to act in the firmament in the daylight, but does not %0areceive permission until the moon rises, i.e., until nightfall, when all the rulers %0aand forces emerge. And when the day breaks (the Upper Light starts shining), %0athey all ascend (the spiritual properties become corrected and improve under %0athe Light's influence) to the Highest of the nine entrances, the point of Keter de %0aMalchut, which remained at its degree above the firmament (Parsa). %0a%0aAnd when the prayer ascends, it enters through this Upper entrance, and all %0athe rulers with their assistants emerge from it, led by their Supreme ruler, Zvuliel, %0athe only ruler of the air of this Upper entrance, who is above the firmament of %0aMalchut de Assiya. They all emerge, kiss the prayer, and accompany it up the %0asecond firmament of Yesod de Assiya. %0a%0aMalchut constitutes the left line— Hochma without Hassadim. Therefore, when %0ashe dominates, the Light does not shine and darkness prevails. Hochma cannot %0ashine without Hassadim, which means that when Malchut rules, it is nighttime %0a(not daylight). Indeed, all nine of her lower Sefirot, from which all the rulers (of %0aman) and forces (man's desires) of the left side originate, rule at night. %0a%0aThis is why it is said that Malchut descends from Bina to her place, although %0aher nine lower Sefirot remained untouched by the impure force, for Malchut %0adescended from the firmament, which transformed her into air. Even so, they %0a(nine Sefirot) have no power in her place, and must rise above the firmament to the %0aUpper entrance, Keter de Malchut. There they enter the right side (Hassadim), and %0athe prayer ascends with them because of their similarity (in desires, properties), %0aachieved while they were below the firmament (in the state called "our world"). %0a%0aAnd since the prayer (MAN) rose above the firmament of Malchut (to GE %0aof the Upper One), it encounters the air (AHP of the still Higher One) that fell %0athere from the second firmament. After the descent of Malchut from Bina of %0aYesod de Assiya to her place, this air ascends to the firmament of Yesod, and takes %0awith it all the rulers, their assistants, and the prayer, which were merged with it %0aduring its fall, and elevates all of them to the firmament of Yesod de Assiya. %0a%0aAnd when the prayer ascends to this firmament (Yesod), the twelve gates %0aof this firmament open up. A special ruler, Ana'el (Anahel), who is in charge %0aof many forces, stands at the twelfth entrance, and when the prayer ascends, %0aproclaims to all the entrances: "Open the gates." And all the entrances open up, %0aand the prayer enters through them. %0a%0a%0a%0a500 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aThis happens because Tifferet has twelve borders of the diagonal, defined %0aby the Sefirot H-G-T-M, each of which contains three lines of HGT, twelve in %0aall. And all that exists in Tifferet is also present in Yesod, but there these twelve %0aborders are called "twelve gates," through which the prayer enters. %0a%0aAnd then awakens a very old ruler, who stands at the Southern side. His %0aname is Azriel-Saba, sometimes referred to as Machaniel, for he is responsible %0afor 600,000 groups (camps— Machanot). All the groups have wings and eyes; they %0astand and listen to all those who are quietly praying, to the prayers that come %0afrom the depths of the heart and are directed only to the Creator. Only such %0aprayers are heard by those who have ears. %0a%0aThere is a special opening in the Sefira Yesod de Hesed (Supernal mercy) that %0adescends from the right line of Bina. Hence, the ruler of this mercy is called %0aAzriel-Saba. He is called Saba (grandfather), because Hochma and Bina are called %0a"old men." And he is appointed to rule over 600,000 groups (camps), because %0a600 = 6 x 100, where 6 = HGT NHY Sefirot in Bina. And since each Sefira in Bina %0ais designated by 100, 6 x 100 = 600. And the thousands stem from Ohr Hochma, %0awhich shines in each of these Sefirot. Hence, 600 x 1,000 = 600,000 groups. %0a%0aGAR de Tvuna, the lower part (ZAT) of Bina, are called "ears." Only Ohr %0aHassadim shines in them, without Hochma. VAK de Tvuna are called "eyes," and %0aOhr Hochma shines in them. %0a%0aMalchut and Bina constitute two kinds of air, West and North, which unite %0aand intermix, and form a diagonal, a combination of judgment and mercy that %0amitigates strictness and judgment. Hence, they hear good words from one who %0amerits it, i.e., they accept one's prayer to the extent of the mercy in the diagonal. %0aAlternatively, they hear bad things about one who does not merit, accepting %0aone's prayer to the extent of the judgment in the diagonal. %0a%0aIf man's ears hear the prayer (which means that he speaks not from the %0adepths of his heart, but with his mouth, so outwardly that his ears hear it, but %0anot his heart), no one will accept it Above. Therefore, man must be watchful: %0ano one should hear his prayer, for the speech of the prayer unites in the Upper %0aWorld, in ZA, and the speech of the Upper World must not be heard. %0a%0aConsider how the Torah is read: one reads and the others keep silent. %0aHowever, if they all read it out loud, they lessen the faith Above, for the voice and %0aspeech of one mingle with the voice and speech of the others, and undermine %0afaith, i.e., Malchut. The voice and speech (ZA is called "voice" and Malchut is %0acalled "speech") of one must be similar to the voice and speech of the other. %0a%0a%0a%0aRaising a Prayer %0a%0a%0a%0a501 %0a%0a%0a%0aTwo reasons are mentioned above as to why a prayer must be speech without %0avoice, unheard by man's ear. The first is that Malchut, who begets people, consists %0aof two points: the Light cannot be received from Malchut with a measure of %0ajudgment, whereas the Light can be received from Malchut that is corrected in %0aBina with a measure of mercy. %0a%0aSimilarly, man consists of a combination of these two points. If he merits, %0athe measure of judgment becomes concealed, the measure of mercy is revealed, %0aand he merits receiving the Upper Light. However, if he does not merit, the %0ameasure of judgment becomes revealed and the Light disappears from him. %0a%0aTherefore, the Upper ear has an inclined form so as to be able to receive the %0aprayer of man-righteous one, him who merits the concealment of the measure %0aof judgment, so that the listening ear would not arouse judgment, concealed %0ain the speech of the prayer. Hence, if an outsider hears the prayer before it %0aascends, he evokes the judgment concealed in the speech of the prayer, and it %0acannot be heard Above. %0a%0aThere is another reason for this: the speech of the prayer constitutes parts %0aof Malchut. And he who prays must be a part of Malchut. Hence, the prayer %0amust ascend and be included in the Supernal Malchut, called "speech." Then %0aMalchut unites with ZA (voice) and the prayer is accepted, i.e., the Light is %0aaccepted from ZA. %0a%0aTherefore, one must not raise his voice during prayer so as to allow the %0aSupernal voice, the Light of ZA, to descend to the praying person. The speech %0aascends to Malchut, merges with ZA with the help of Malchut, and receives a %0acompletely corrected voice from ZA. As a result, the prayer can receive the Light. %0aIt is therefore said that the words of a prayer pronounced by man's voice must %0anot be heard. %0a%0aHe who reads the Torah must also be a part of ZA, called "Torah." And the %0avoice of one who reads Torah must be instead of the voice of ZA. Hence, it is %0aforbidden to hear someone else's voice, for it will be the voice of one who exists %0aunder judgment, and not under mercy. %0a%0aThus, the voice of an outsider harms the voice of one who reads the Torah, %0aand Malchut is unable to receive the Light from ZA. Yet, if this is the voice and %0aspeech of one man, then the voice, called ZA, and speech, called Malchut, merge %0ainto one combination. But if voice and speech of an outsider join the reader's, %0ait will harm him. %0a%0aWith regard to everything mentioned above, one can say that only he %0awho approaches the described state can understand what The Zohar narrates. %0a%0a%0a%0a502 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aSpiritual actions are understood in one's heart, his desires, his properties. If %0athey do not correspond to those that are described above, no explanation of any %0akind will help. An "outsider" designates man's "foreign" (distant from spiritual %0aaspirations) thoughts and desires. %0a%0aWhen a quiet, concealed, and secret prayer ascends, the governor Azriel- %0aSaba himself and all of his assistants, who are in charge of the 600,000 groups %0a(camps), and all those who have eyes and ears emerge and kiss the ascending %0aword of the prayer. %0a%0aThis is said in the verse: "The Creator's eyes and ears are upon them." %0aThe Creator's eyes rest upon the righteous. The Creator's eyes refer to those %0abelow who have eyes, meaning the angels that exist in the firmament of Yesod de %0aAssiya. They exist Above, at the degree of GAR, for eyes signify the property of %0aHochma. However, these eyes are the eyes of the Sefira Yesod, as it is written: "The %0aCreator's eyes rest upon the righteous," as Yesod is called the "righteous one." %0a%0aThe third firmament is the Sefirot Net^ah and Hod de Assiya. The prayer %0aascends to this firmament. The ruler Gadria, who controls this firmament with %0ahis assistants, acts three times a day during the ascent of the three lines to the %0aworld of Atzilut, when the luminous scepter of Light ascends and descends, but %0adoes not stay in one place, for Ohr Hochma of the left line (called the "scepter of %0aLight") wants to shine. %0a%0aThe word "scepter" (Hebrew, Sharvit) signifies eyesight, and Ohr Hochma is %0acalled the Light of eyesight. The scepter moves three times and conceals itself, %0abecause Hochma reveals itself only when the three lines move in the three points: %0aHolam (the dot above the letters), Shuruk (the dot inside the letters), and Hirik %0a(the dot below the letters). %0a%0aWhen the prayer, which is the middle line, ascends and carries the screen of %0aHirik, the scepter (the Light of the left line) descends and bows its head before %0athe prayer, designating the concealment of GAR, called "head." This is because %0athe middle line reduces the left line with the help of the screen of Hirik. This %0athird firmament of Sefirot Netzah and Hod de Assiya is called the "firmament of %0athe scepter," for the scepter of Light acts within it. %0a%0aWhen the prayer ascends, the ruler bows his head before it (diminishes his %0alevel) and then strikes the iridescent rock with his scepter. The rock stands at the %0acenter (the middle line) of the firmament, and 365 hosts emerge from the rock, %0awhich were concealed within it since the Torah descended to the earth. Because %0athey objected to this descent, the Creator reproached them, and they concealed %0athemselves in the rock. %0a%0a%0a%0aRaising a Prayer %0a%0a%0a%0a503 %0a%0a%0a%0aHere, by analogy with the aforesaid and in accordance with the definitions %0aof such notions as a scepter, a rock, hosts, Light, concealment, to %0abow," the reader is offered an opportunity to translate from the language of %0alegends into the language of spiritual actions. And when the reader attains what %0ais written, he will feel it within him! %0a%0aAnd they do not emerge from there, except for when the prayer ascends. %0aThen they praise the Creator, saying: "Our Creator, how great is Your name %0aupon the earth!" This prayer is called "Great," because it ascends to all these %0afirmaments, and they bow before it. %0a%0aThis occurs because the angels that opposed the descent of the Torah (see %0athe article "Heaven and Earth"), i.e., the middle line, to the earth (Malchut and %0athe worlds of BYA), emerge from the left line. And they wanted the left line to %0adominate in Malchut and in the worlds of BYA, but not the middle one, called %0athe "Torah," which reduces the GAR of the Light of the left line. %0a%0aMalchut, called "earth," includes all the worlds of BYA. However, the Creator %0a(middle line) reproached and compelled her to receive the Light of the middle %0aline and conceal herself in the rock, in the forces of judgment, which exist in the %0amiddle line that stands at the center of the firmament. %0a%0aHowever, the prayer can ascend only by activating the left line, namely Bina %0aand ZON that fell to the lower degree, then ascended once more above the %0afirmament, and became the left line. They take the prayer that existed with %0athem during their descent to the lower degree. %0a%0aThis is why the ruler receives the scepter, the Light of the left line, for %0aduring the ascent of the prayer, the left line shines in his domain. The 365 hosts %0athen awaken and receive the Light of the left line from the scepter. Hence, they %0aexclaim: "The Creator, Our Lord, how great is Your name upon the earth!" for %0athe prayer ascends to this firmament, called "Great," and includes the screen of %0aHirik of the left line, from the GAR. Thus, they bow their heads, i.e., do not use %0athe GAR of Ohr Hochma, but only VAK. %0a%0aAfterward, the prayer clothes in the Supernal adornments and rises to the %0afourth firmament, Tifferet. Then the sun (Tifferet) emerges at its level, the Supreme %0aruler Shimshiel, and the 365 hosts ascend to this firmament along with him. %0aThey are called "the days of the sun," for these levels stem from the sun, Tifferet. %0aAnd they all clothe and adorn Malchut in the Heavens of the Garden of Eden. %0a%0aThe prayer pauses there to merge with the air of Gevura of those degrees, %0abecause it was not supposed to pause at the previous firmament, NHY, as they %0aare included in Tifferet. And the prayer remains there until all the hosts have %0a%0a%0a%0a504 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0arisen with it to the fifth firmament (Gevura), where Gadriel rules; he is in charge %0aof all the hosts of the other nations, for Gevura constitutes the left line, which %0athe other nations hold on to. %0a%0aAnd when the prayer ascends, carrying within the screen of the middle %0aline (which reduces the left line from GAR to VAK), it shakes him and all of his %0ahosts, and they lose all their strength, emerge and bow their heads, i.e., GAR, %0aand adorn this prayer. %0a%0aThey ascend with it to the sixth firmament, Hesed, and the legions and hosts %0acome forth and accept the prayer until they reach the seventy gates, HGT NHYM, %0aeach of which consists of ten, as Hesed includes all seven lower Sefirot. The Supreme %0aruler, Anafiel, stands there and adorns the prayer with seventy adornments. %0a%0aAnd since the prayer was adorned, all the legions and hosts of all the %0afirmaments that accompanied the prayer from firmament to firmament unite %0aand raise the prayer to the seventh firmament, Bina, which includes GAR. %0a%0aThe prayer enters the seventh firmament, and the Supreme ruler Sandalphon, %0awho is in charge of all the guards at the entrances, ushers the prayer into the %0aseven halls of the world of Yetzira. These are the seven halls of the King, the %0aseven halls of Malchut de Atzilut, where ZA rules. %0a%0aWhen the prayer, adorned with all of these adornments, ascends there, it %0aunites ZA with Malchut, for everything grows with similarity to everything else. %0aAnd the Creator's name, i.e., Malchut is adorned from Above and from below, %0aand on all sides, as Malchut merges with ZA into one. And then Yesod (the %0arighteous one) fills Malchut with its blessings. %0a%0aHappy is the lot of him who can put his prayer in proper order, so the %0aCreator will clothe in this prayer. He waits until all the prayers of Israel finish %0aascending and unite into a complete and perfect prayer, whereupon everything %0awill become perfect both Above and below. %0a%0aBesides the prayer, there are the Mitzvot of the Torah that depend on speech %0aand action. There are six Mitzvot that depend on speech: %0a%0a1. To fear the Great and Mighty Creator; %0a%0a2. To love the Creator; %0a%0a3. To bless the Creator; %0a%0a4. To proclaim the Creator's unity; %0a%0a5. To bless the nation, which is incumbent on Cohanim (priests); %0a%0a6. To entrust one's soul with the Creator. %0a%0a%0a%0aRaising a Prayer %0a%0a%0a%0a505 %0a%0a%0a%0aOut of the six above-mentioned Mitzvot, the first finds its place in the %0ablessings that King David sang during his offerings in the Torah, where man %0amust fear his Master, for these songs stand in a place called "fear" or Malchut. %0aAnd all of these written blessings constitute the essence of fear of the Creator, %0aMalchut. And man must sing these songs with his desires in fear. %0a%0aMan must achieve a level of spiritual development where his desires will %0acoincide with what is said in the texts of these blessings. It is impossible to force %0asomeone to wish something; all our feelings are the product, the result of our %0aspiritual level. The Light of that degree influences one's egoism and corrects it %0awith the power of that degree. Therefore, man can only ask for correction, but %0a%0aHere we have a list of degrees that man must gradually go through in his %0acorrection. These degrees are usually called Mitzvot, and in all there are 620 of %0athem between us and the Creator: 613 Mitzvot of the Torah for Israel (altruism) %0aand seven Mit^ot of the Torah for all the nations (egoism). Here they are %0aexpounded in a different way: since the most important is to ask for correction %0a(and if the request is genuine, the answer in the form of Light immediately %0adescends to it), all of man's work on himself, all of his efforts in the study, work %0aand actions are aimed only at the creation of a true request, MAN. Hence, the %0astages of man's spiritual development are described as his path in prayer; as if %0ahe stands and prays, although this process continues within him throughout his %0alife on earth. %0a%0aThe second Mitzva: to love the Creator (as it was repeatedly stated, this %0afeeling is the result of correction; see "Introduction to the Study of Ten Sefirot," %0aitem 45— the four degrees of sensation of governance, from darkness to love), %0awhen in his prayer one reaches Ahavat Olam (great love) and Le El (for the %0aCreator). These two blessings precede the appeal, Shema Israel (Hear, O Israel) %0aand Ve Ahavta Et (and love the Creator), the blessing of the Creator for one's %0alove for Him that follows the appeal Shema Israel. And this is the secret of love %0afor the Creator. %0a%0aThe third Mit^i/a: since man reaches a place in the prayer that is called %0aLehishtabe'ach (blessed is the Creator), he must attain praises and blessings of the %0aCreator in his desire, as in parts of the prayer Yotzer Ohr (He who creates Light) %0aand Yotzer HaMeohrot (maker of the stars). %0a%0aThe fourth Mitzva is to proclaim the Creator's unity, i.e., Shema Israel (Hear, %0aO Israel, our Creator is one!). From this point (degree) on, one must express %0athe secret of the Creator's unity (in all His manifestations to man) in his heart's %0a%0a%0a%0a506 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0adesire (one's heart must be filled only with the sensation of the One, Upper %0aForce). Afterward, the Mitzva to remember and remind others of the exodus %0afrom Egypt (egoism) is observed, as it is written: "Remember how you were a %0aslave in Egypt." %0a%0aThe fifth Mitzva is for a Cohen to bless the people (the Light's descent to the %0aPartzuf), so that Israel will be included when the prayer (the Cohanim's blessing) %0aascends, for at this time (state), Knesset Israel (all those who correct themselves by %0aaspiring to the Creator and constitute a part of Malchut de Atzilut), i.e., Malchut, %0areceives a blessing (Light). %0a%0aThe sixth Mitzva and the desired time (state, spiritual level when man wishes %0aonly to give all of his desires, i.e., his soul, to the Creator, meaning that he can %0aact for the Creator's sake in all of his desires) is to entrust one's soul with the %0aCreator with complete desire in one's heart. When one falls (willingly accepts %0athe small state) on his face (Hochma) and proclaims (raises MAN): "I entrust my %0asoul with You, O Creator." The intentions and desires of his heart are to give his %0asoul completely to the Creator (this desire is the consequence of this spiritual %0adegree and comes naturally to those who attain it). %0a%0aThese six Mitzvot of the prayer correspond to the 600 Mitzvot of the Torah. %0aAnd the remaining thirteen Mitzvot are required in order to attract the thirteen %0aproperties of mercy (thirteen Midot HaRachamim), which include all the rest. %0aThe prayer is adorned with 600 Mitzvot, which corresponds to HGT NHY, to %0awhat the prayer, Malchut, receives from ZA. %0a%0aHappy is he who heeded and focused his desire on this (who was able to %0araise a proper request for his correction), who completed all that was required %0aeach day (in the Creator's daylight), and directed his heart's intentions and %0adesires to fulfill this Mitzva, which depends on the word. %0a%0a%0a%0aThe End

This inner action of man constitutes his greatest and most %0a%3c valuable work in his efforts for the Creator's sake. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Creator made man at the farthest, completely opposite spiritual le %0a%3c His: with only the egoistic will to enjoy. And since man has no other properti %0a%3c desires but the egoistic will to receive pleasure, not only is he unable to chang- %0a%3c himself, he cannot even wish for the desire to change. %0a%3c %0a%3c We can change only under the influence of the Creator's Light, by receivin %0a%3c His properties from Him. Hence our only task is to cultivate a desire to change. %0a%3c As soon as this true desire appears within man, the Creator will immediately %0a%3c jive him the strength needed for its realization. So the problem is not how %0a%3c %0a%3c )rayer; it is, rather, how to attain it, how to formulate one's reque %0a%3c le strength to become like the Creator! %0a%3c %0a%3c A prayer is a sensation, a desire in one's heart. Man does not re; %0a%3c completely and cannot describe it, for the sensation in one's heart is %0a%3c not subject to any control and conscious correction— it cannot be "created" by %0a%3c one's own will. The sensations in one's heart constitute the consequence of %0a%3c man's mental and spiritual condition, the result of the current degree of his %0a%3c spiritual development. %0a%3c %0a%3c Thus, the desire to change is also in the Creator's hands. However, He %0a%3c us the opportunity to stimulate this process and to determine our own %0a%3c lal advancement: %0a%3c %0a%3c )balists to write books, and when we read them %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c lows %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c develop the desire to draw closer to Him; %0a%3c - He allows some of the true Kabbalists to be revealed to a wide circle %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 473 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 474 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Indiscernibly, He transforms our desires (modifies our souls) so %0a%3c lly take an interest in spirituality; %0a%3c %0a%3c le changes our desires with regard to this world, helping us realize %0a%3c insignificance and transience through sensations of disappoint %0a%3c md suffering. %0a%3c %0a%3c 3y creating man a worthless egoist, i.e., by making a worthless creation that %0a%3c is seemingly so unbefitting Him, the Creator allowed man to create himself and %0a%3c elevate himself to an equal degree to that of the Creator Himself— to attain His %0a%3c svel of perfection. Thus, the Creator reveals the perfection of His creatior %0a%3c y\i He created man a worthless creature, He thereby enables him to ma %0a%3c Creator" of himself (in his properties). %0a%3c %0a%3c innot claim that although he is created with only one desire %0a%3c unable to induce the reception of an altruistic desire instead of his natura %0a%3c egoistic one. The Torah, Kabbalah, teachers, and suffering are all prepared to %0a%3c accelerate his advancement toward the goal of creation by the path of the Torah, %0a%3c or otherwise, the path of suffering. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, the path of suffering is not only undesirable for man, whose life %0a%3c on earth makes him feel as though he is caught between the millstones %0a%3c tirelessly revolving mill. Ruthlessly and methodically, it pulverizes hir %0a%3c mentally and physically, to the very last day of his life. But this painful path is %0a%3c equally undesirable in the eyes of the Creator. After all, His goal is to delight %0a%3c man, which is in accord with the path of the Torah— a quick and painless way to %0a%3c transform our desires from egoistic into altruistic. %0a%3c %0a%3c Since only the Creator can accomplish this (and He will, either painfully %0a%3c or painlessly, in accord with our conscious request), the development of sue! %0a%3c request toward Him is all that man must do in his life. It is hence written: "I %0a%3c him pray all day long!" Yet, we now understand that this phrase does not spe %0a%3c of sitting over a prayer-book, but refers to man's inner work on himself. %0a%3c %0a%3c There are various forms of work that man must do in action, with his body, %0a%3c as in the case of physically observing the Mitzvot. And then there is man's inner, %0a%3c most important work, when observance of the Mitzvot depends on the words %0a%3c and desires of the heart. %0a%3c %0a%3c Never does Kabbalah allude to or even mention our physical body, for it %0a%3c is no different from the body of an animal— it is born, functions, and dies as %0a%3c an animal. And all the various forms of work that the body performs are mere %0a%3c mechanical actions utterly unconnected to man's inner intention, and can even %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c nose me %0a%3c nes of a %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Raising a Prayer %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 475 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c fore, the body's actions are completely disregarded in Kabba %0a%3c 's desire is taken into account and is regarded as an action. In itself %0a%3c d off the physical body (in which it presently exists), it constitutes %0a%3c iritual action. %0a%3c %0a%3c lal world is a world of incorporeal desires that have no voh %0a%3c size, movement, or time. Just as in our imagination, where our desires are %0a%3c fulfilled instantly by the power of thought, everything in the spiritual world is %0a%3c determined only by our desires-thoughts, and not by physical actions. %0a%3c %0a%3c Nevertheless, since in this world we temporarily exist in a physiological body, %0a%3c our task is to observe the Creator's Mitzvot both physically (with our body) and %0a%3c spiritually. Physically, we can observe them, as a person usually does— because %0a%3c of his upbringing or for a reward in this world (money, health, luck, peace, and %0a%3c so forth) or in the world to come (the best that he can imagine). Alternatively, %0a%3c he performs these actions because he was taught from childhood to do so %0a%3c mechanically, so he cannot avoid doing them in view of the acquired desire %0a%3c (instinct)— if he does not do them, he suffers. %0a%3c %0a%3c This feeling of suffering is exactly what compels him to carry out the %0a%3c mechanical actions of the Mitzvot. It is not even the desire to receive a reward %0a%3c in this world or in the world to come: in this case, the reward is instantaneous- %0a%3c man feels no discomfort, since he does what he is accustomed to do. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, it seems to such a man, who observes the Mitzvot because of the %0a%3c acquired nature (habit), that he demands no reward for his actions either in %0a%3c this world or in the world to come. After all, he truly does not think about any %0a%3c reward, as his habit, which became his second nature, compels him to perform %0a%3c these actions. If he feels this way, he is absolutely positive that he acts "for the %0a%3c Creator's sake." The fact that his habit, his second nature, compels him to %0a%3c perform the Mitzvot mechanically, escapes his awareness. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, since our body is no more than an animal, the mechanical %0a%3c fulfillment of the Mitzvot by force of habit or for a reward is quite sufficient for %0a%3c him. There is a difference between those who observe because of upbringing or %0a%3c habit, and those who do it for a reward: the former do not even care whether %0a%3c or not the Creator actually exists; they perform purely mechanical actions that %0a%3c they cannot help performing, for they immediately begin to suffer for lack of %0a%3c habitual actions. %0a%3c %0a%3c Yet, one who observes the Mitzvot because he has faith in reward and %0a%3c punishment believes in the Creator, His Torah, and His governance, but simply %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 476 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c uses it for his own benefit. By observing the Mitzvot with such an intention %0a%3c and remaining in it all of his life, he, naturally, does not grow spiritually. And %0a%3c he who does not grow in our world is called "still" (inanimate), as we divide all %0a%3c nature into the following levels: still, vegetative, animate, and speaking (human). %0a%3c Therefore, such people are regarded as spiritually still (Domem de Kedusha), but %0a%3c they are already "spiritually" still, as opposed to those who observe mechanically, %0a%3c by force of habit. %0a%3c %0a%3c In Kabbalah, the word "body" implies desire. A desire or a body can be %0a%3c goistic or spiritual (altruistic). The gradual passing of the egoistic body and its %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c : with the altruistic one is called man's "spiritual birth." %0a%3c %0a%3c Man's spiritual growth is designated by an increasingly growing intention %0a%3c to observe the Mitzvot only because such is the Creator's desire. Man observes %0a%3c it only for His sake, completely selflessly, as if no reward of any kind will ever %0a%3c be given to him in return, not even in the form of his own self-content. It is %0a%3c as though the Creator does not know who fulfills His desire, as though man %0a%3c himself is uncertain of whether or not he observes the Mitzvot. Yet, he does it %0a%3c anyway, for such is the Creator's will. %0a%3c %0a%3c So then, the notion of "body" in Kabbalah alludes to man's corrected %0a%3c ;sires, whereas uncorrected desires, without a screen, cannot be used, %0a%3c igh they are not considered body parts, existing beyond the body, %0a%3c considered foreign forces or desires— Klipot (shells). %0a%3c %0a%3c only existing creation besides the Creator is the egoistic will tc %0a%3c lim that was created by Him. This desire can be either egoistic (corrupted) or %0a%3c altruistic (corrected), spiritually pure or impure. All the spiritual forces: angels, %0a%3c Klipot, etc., constitute our uncorrected or corrected desires (the will to bestow %0a%3c delight upon the Creator). Nothing else exists in the universe! %0a%3c %0a%3c There are twelve parts in the spiritual body that perform spiritual actions: %0a%3c two arms and two legs, each consisting of three parts, in all 4 x 3 = 12. These %0a%3c parts of our spiritual body (our desires that were corrected by the screen) observe %0a%3c the positive Mitzvot. %0a%3c %0a%3c Just like the body of a spiritual object (Partzuf), man's body is his altruistic %0a%3c desires, in which he can receive the Creator's Light according to his intentions %0a%3c (screen). Man's desires are determined by his intentions. %0a%3c %0a%3c All the work with the intention "for the Creator's sake" is performed by %0a%3c the external body parts: the twelve parts of arms and legs, and by the twelve %0a%3c internal body parts: brain, heart, liver, mouth, tongue, five parts of the lungs, %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Raising a Prayer %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 477 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c and two kidneys. These inner corrections of the body are meant for reception of %0a%3c the Supernal spirit, Light, inside the body, and represent man's most important %0a%3c work with regard to the Creator. %0a%3c %0a%3c These inner actions are called Mitzvot. They depend on speech, such as a %0a%3c prayer— supplications, blessings, and praises. And he who comes to know this %0a%3c work is happy in all things. Man does not realize that his prayer permeates all %0a%3c the Heavens, rising up to the very pinnacle of the universe and reaching the %0a%3c Creator Himself. %0a%3c %0a%3c As was repeatedly mentioned, not a single word in the Torah speaks of our %0a%3c world, especially not of our body. All the words in the Torah are the Creator's %0a%3c sacred names— the various sensations of the Creator felt by those who attain %0a%3c Him. As we have explained, the attainment and sensation of the Creator is %0a%3c impossible without a screen, an altruistic intention, meaning that all that man %0a%3c desires is to please his Creator. Only the sensations in the heart (the essence of %0a%3c man) can perform this work, and never the physiological organs of our animate %0a%3c body, which is no different from that of an animal. %0a%3c %0a%3c When the morning Light begins to shine, separating Light from darkness, %0a%3c a call pierces through all the Heavens: prepare for the opening of entrances and %0a%3c chambers, and each go to your position. For the ones that serve at night are not the %0a%3c ones that serve in the daytime. And when the night comes, the daytime servants %0a%3c are once more replaced by the nighttime ones. %0a%3c %0a%3c When the morning Light begins to shine— when man begins to realize that %0a%3c his egoistic desires are death and darkness, whereas altruism and spirituality are %0a%3c life and Light, the Light within man thereby separates from darkness, and he %0a%3c begins to analyze and realize his states, to feel spiritual ascents and descents— he %0a%3c feels his proximity to the Creator as Light, while remoteness from Him and %0a%3c descents into his egoistic desires feel like darkness. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, one can feel it only if he feels the Creator (even if only a little, %0a%3c even if indistinctly). To start feeling the shame of receiving from the Creator and %0a%3c e insignificance of one's nature (the sensation of darkness), one must first feel %0a%3c e Creator. Only His Light contains all that man needs: strength for correction, %0a%3c ■.sires, life. Hence, the main thing to which man must aspire is the sensation of %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The forces that serve in the daytime are called the "rulers, the government of %0a%3c the day," and the forces that serve at night are called the "rulers, the government %0a%3c of the night." As soon as the morning call is heard, they all take their positions, %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 478 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut and Israel descend and enter the Beit-Knesset (the House of Assembly— %0a%3c a place, where all of man's wishes are collected; hence, it is called the house of %0a%3c prayer) to exalt the Creator and begin their singing and blessings. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is written: "We shall praise Your mercy in the morning and Your faith at %0a%3c night." Feeling the Creator's Light descending upon him, man perceives it as %0a%3c morning that comes after the darkness, and upon feeling such a state, he praises %0a%3c the Creator in his heart. All alien thoughts retreat before the influence of the %0a%3c Creator's Light, and all impure desires become restrained. %0a%3c %0a%3c After man has corrected himself in the positive Mitzvot (in the first part, %0a%3c in the corrections of Tzitzit and Tefillin), he must unite all of his heart's desires %0a%3c in inner work (in the second part), and wholeheartedly dedicate himself to the %0a%3c work of praises, since speech rises upwards. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is impossible to offer a brief explanation of the Mitzvot of Tefillin and %0a%3c Tzitzit, observed only by those who spiritually attained the level of Partzuf ZA. %0a%3c %0a%3c These servants, who stood in their places in the air, are appointed to rule %0a%3c over the four sides of the world. Gazaria soars in the air to govern the East, and %0a%3c all the others that are appointed are together with him, and await the words of %0a%3c the prayer that rises on that side from below. And this ruler takes the prayer. %0a%3c %0a%3c If the words of a prayer are proper, then all these rulers absorb them and %0a%3c rise with them to the firmament, where the other rulers stand. Upon absorbing %0a%3c these words, they proclaim, "Blessed be Israel. Blessed be the lips that utter %0a%3c these words!" %0a%3c %0a%3c The letters that were hanging in the air then fly up and form the holy %0a%3c name that rules in the air and consists of twelve letters. This is the name by %0a%3c which Eliyahu flew before rising up to the sky. The letters fly up in the air, %0a%3c and the ruler, who holds the keys to the air in his hand, rises to Heaven along %0a%3c with all the other rulers, and pass the letters into the hands of another ruler %0a%3c for further ascent. %0a%3c %0a%3c After Malchut had been separated from ZA, ZA filled himself with only Ohr %0a%3c Hassadim and became the right line, whereas Malchut formed the left line. These %0a%3c two lines are in conflict with one another, just as the right and the left lines of %0a%3c Bina oppose one another. This continues until ZA ascends to Bina as the middle %0a%3c line, balances the right and the left lines, and makes peace between them by %0a%3c uniting them in a single, middle line. %0a%3c %0a%3c Similarly, ZA and Malchut, the two opposite lines, need a middle line to %0a%3c balance them, to bring them balance and peace, and to unite them. This occurs %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Raising a Prayer %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 479 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c with the help of MAN (Mei Nukvin), the prayers of the righteous, for they offer %0a%3c up the desires from this world. Also, the screen that they raise is called the %0a%3c Masach (screen) de (of) Hirik— the middle line— causing the left and the right lines %0a%3c to unite, and Malchut to unite with ZA. %0a%3c %0a%3c Thus, a prayer becomes a request, MAN, and the middle line that leads to %0a%3c peace and unity between ZA and Malchut. Just like Yesod Above (the middle line) %0a%3c unites the Creator with the Shechina-Malchut by gathering all the created souls, %0a%3c man's prayer creates the middle line and unites all by its ascent— bringing peace %0a%3c and unity between the Creator and the Shechina (His creatures), the unity of %0a%3c souls with their Creator. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, just like the Sefira Yesod Above, man, too, is called Shalom (peace). %0a%3c Moreover, the world below precedes and determines the world Above, for the %0a%3c awakening from below (requests of the lower ones) precedes and evokes the %0a%3c awakening from Above. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c - except 1 %0a%3c %0a%3c imagine derives only from these two spiritual forces. Man's desire is called a %0a%3c "prayer," for intentionally or unintentionally, this desire appeals to the One %0a%3c who created man, to the Creator. Spiritually, man develops in accordance %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c w %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ithh %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c is prayer. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c However, one's true prayer is his request for spiritual correction and elevation. %0a%3c Such a prayer, a desire in the heart, can be achieved only by consistent study %0a%3c of Kabbalistic sources, which affect man's egoistic desire with their concealed %0a%3c inner Light, and evoke him to ascend spiritually ("Introduction to The Study of %0a%3c Ten Sefirot," item 155). %0a%3c %0a%3c A soul is none other than man's corrected, altruistic desire, his spiritual %0a%3c Partzuf, his desire to receive the Creator's Light with the screen (intention) "for %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Man's speech in a prayer is none other than parts of his soul (the soul itself) %0a%3c clothed in a body. A prayer is man's soul in this world, VAK de Nefesh of Malchut %0a%3c de Malchut within Malchut de Assiya. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 480 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c World of AK %0a%3c World of Atzilut %0a%3c World of Beria %0a%3c World ofYetzira %0a%3c World of Assiya: Keter %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Hochma %0a%3c %0a%3c Bina %0a%3c %0a%3c ZA %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut=K + H + B + ZA+M %0a%3c %0a%3c K+H+B+ZA+M %0a%3c %0a%3c GAR + VAK = Soul of Man %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Yet, how can one's prayer, his desire, rise through all the degrees of all %0a%3c the worlds of BYA and reach Malchut de Atzilut so as to become MAN and the %0a%3c middle line, uniting Malchut with ZA? After all, it is well known that no degree %0a%3c can rise above itself, let alone make such an incredible leap from the lowest %0a%3c degree of the spiritual ladder (our world) to the world of Atzilut. %0a%3c %0a%3c To understand that, we must first thoroughly understand the meaning of %0a%3c Malchut's ascent to Bina. As a result of this ascent, each degree splits into two %0a%3c parts: Keter and Hochma of each degree remain within it, while Bina, ZA, and %0a%3c Malchut fall to a lower degree. This occurs because Malchut ascended to Bina and %0a%3c thereby created in Bina a new Sof (end) of the degree. This is because Malchut %0a%3c exists under the prohibition of the first restriction, and hence cannot receive the %0a%3c Light. Due to the second restriction, Bina, ZA, and Malchut are located below %0a%3c the new Sof of the degree. Thus, being below Malchut that ascended to Bina, they %0a%3c are defined as a lower degree. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Bina =Awzen %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ZA = Hotem ) Together they are called AHP (Awzen-Hotem-Peh) %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut = Peh %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Together they are called GE (Galgalta-Eynaim) %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Parsa = Ascended Malchut %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Raising a Prayer %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 481 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Afterward, through the MAN raised by the lower ones, the Light AB-SAG %0a%3c descends and gives strength to Malchut, which stands in Bina, to descend to her %0a%3c own place: Malchut descends from Bina to her own place, thereby returning all %0a%3c the Sefirot to their places and uniting them all into one degree, consisting of %0a%3c ten whole Sefirot. Consequently, Bina and ZON, which were below each degree, %0a%3c return to their degree, to their previous level. Thus, each degree restores itself %0a%3c back to ten Sefirot. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, although Malchut, who stood in Bina as the new Sof (end) of the %0a%3c degree, returns from Bina to her own place at the end of every ten Sefirot, this %0a%3c new Sof that she created in Bina does not entirely vanish from Bina. As a result, %0a%3c Bina and ZON do not descend to their place. Instead, they must rise above the %0a%3c new Sof and there create the left line with regard to Keter and Hochma, which %0a%3c never fell from their degree and constitute the right line. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is why the new Sof remains in its place in all the degrees even after %0a%3c Malchut 's descent from Bina. And this Sof is called the "firmament," while Bina %0a%3c and ZON, which fell from their degree, but now have returned to it, are called %0a%3c "air." For each lower degree is defined as VAK (called Avir— air) with regard to %0a%3c the Upper One. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Since Bina and ZON fell from their degree, they became as VAK (air) with %0a%3c regard to it, as the entire lower degree with regard to the Upper. And after %0a%3c the descent of Malchut from Bina, the air (Bina and ZON) that was under the %0a%3c firmament rises above it and becomes the left line. %0a%3c %0a%3c When Bina and ZON ascend above the firmament, they take with them %0a%3c the lower degree, where they existed when they were below, and elevate it along %0a%3c with them above the firmament. It is so because unlike our world, there are no %0a%3c ascents and descents in the spiritual; a descent constitutes the deterioration of %0a%3c one's properties from one spiritual level to a lower one. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Parsa (Firmament) - %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Bina %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c = Awzen %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c AHP (Air) %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 482 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, being equivalent in properties with the lower degree, when Bina and %0a%3c ZON ascend together, they take the entire lower degree along with them. For %0a%3c after being together once, and having become similar, they receive help, ascend, %0a%3c and never part again. %0a%3c %0a%3c Ultimately, Malchut's ascent to Bina forms an entrance, an opening, a gate %0a%3c for the lower degree, through which it can ascend to the Upper One. Hence, %0a%3c when Malchut descends from Bina, thus allowing the lower part, AHP de Bina, to %0a%3c ascend, the lower degree can rise along with the ascending AHP de Bina. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c K %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c GEof the Upper One %0a%3c %0a%3c Firmament %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c B %0a%3c %0a%3c The entire %0a%3c level ZA %0a%3c %0a%3c ascends %0a%3c %0a%3c M %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c K %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c AHP of the Upper One (Air) %0a%3c & GE of the Lower One %0a%3c %0a%3c Land or Earth of the Upper One %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ZA / AHP of the Lower One %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c M %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Thus, as a result of Malchut's ascent to Bina and her subsequent descent due %0a%3c to the influence of Ohr AB-SAG, three parts were formed in each degree: %0a%3c %0a%3c - Air, Bina and ZON that fell down; %0a%3c %0a%3c - The firmaments, the new ends of degrees that appeared through %0a%3c Malchut's ascent to Bina. These never disappear, even if Malchut %0a%3c returns to her place; %0a%3c %0a%3c - The entrances for the lower degrees that were formed through %0a%3c Malchut's ascent to Bina, when the lower degree ascends along with %0a%3c her. Without it, the lower degree can never reach the Upper One, for %0a%3c no degree can ascend above itself. %0a%3c %0a%3c This process is described in the Chassidic tales as the mission of a righteous %0a%3c one (the Upper Degree) in our world: to descend to the most vile and corrupt %0a%3c people (the lower degree). In other words, while essentially remaining itself, %0a%3c the Upper Degree should corrupt its properties so as to equalize with the lower %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Raising a Prayer %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 483 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c :gree. Thus, it shows to the lower ones that in its desires, thoughts, and actions, %0a%3c is the same as them. %0a%3c %0a%3c Then, when he completely unites with them, and they fully trust him, %0a%3c e becomes "one of them" (designating the union of AHP of the Upper %0a%3c ith GE of the lower one), he gradually, inconspicuously or openly, begins to %0a%3c correct them— by his own example, he propagates his thoughts to them. These %0a%3c thoughts cannot be perceived from an outsider, but only from "one of their %0a%3c hat is, the Upper One receives additional Light (strength) in its GE %0a%3c le to raise its own AHP, correct its desires of reception, start wo %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c And since there is no distinction between the desires of AHP of the Upper %0a%3c One and GE of the lower one, into which AHP of the Upper One fell, they both %0a%3c rise together. This way, the Upper One elevates, i.e., improves, corrects a certain %0a%3c part of the lower one's properties (GE), and elevates them to its true level. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, the most important thing in our state is to come to feel AHP of %0a%3c the Upper Degree, located at the very center of our heart, and to become equal %0a%3c with it in our properties so as to afterwards rise together with it. %0a%3c %0a%3c This process is described in the book Attaining the Worlds Beyond, which %0a%3c provides a more personal perspective of this spiritual process: %0a%3c %0a%3c Inside the internal sensations of the Kabbalist exists a part of the Higher %0a%3c evel, of the future state (AHP). One who perceives a Higher Spiritual Level ; %0a%3c 1 unattractive vacuum, rather than a state full of Light, does not receive %0a%3c ler level. %0a%3c %0a%3c en though the Higher Level is full of Light, the lower level perceives %0a%3c ;r only to the degree that the lower qualities permit one to do so. Since the %0a%3c present qualities are not sufficient to receive the Higher Light, the individual %0a%3c does not perceive it. %0a%3c %0a%3c We can perceive the Upper Level because all the spiritual steps are arranged %0a%3c sequentially from lowest to highest. Moreover, the subsequent states overlap %0a%3c th one another; the lower half of the Higher state is situated within the Upper %0a%3c er state (AHP of Upper falls into GE of lower). %0a%3c %0a%3c , the lowest part of our Upper State is always present within us, %0a%3c usually not felt by us. The Upper State above us is referred to as "the Creator" %0a%3c functions as the Creator for us. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c It gives birth to us and it gives us life and guidance. Since we do not ha %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 484 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c iin over al %0a%3c freely. %0a%3c %0a%3c can see only One Truth, %0a%3c rates in everything and in everyone. %0a%3c %0a%3c Since the Will of the Creator is to grant each human being a free will, then %0a%3c the concealment of the Creator from His creations is necessary. Only if He is %0a%3c hidden can we argue that we can aspire of our free will to attach ourselves to the %0a%3c Creator— to act for His sake, without any trace of self-interest. %0a%3c %0a%3c le entire process of self-correction is possible only when the Crea %0a%3c lied from us. As soon as He reveals Himself to us we immediately 1 %0a%3c servants and fall into the control of His thought, grandeur and pc %0a%3c %0a%3c that point, it is impossible to determine what our true thoi %0a%3c rder to allow us to act freely, the Creator has to conceal Hir %0a%3c %0a%3c On the other hand, to give us a chance to break free from the blind slave %0a%3c of egoism, the Creator must reveal Himself. This is so because a human being %0a%3c obeys only two forces in this world: the force of egoism— the body— and the force %0a%3c of the Creator— altruism. %0a%3c %0a%3c It follows, then, that alternating the two states is necessary. These states are %0a%3c the concealment of the Creator from us when we perceive only ourselves and %0a%3c the egoistic forces governing us, and the revelation of the Creator when %0a%3c power of the spiritual forces. %0a%3c %0a%3c l order for one who is still under the influence of egoism to percei %0a%3c Upper Object (the Creator), the Creator must equalize some of His %0a%3c qualities with those of the lower being— the person seeking a connection with %0a%3c the Creator. %0a%3c %0a%3c He will endow some of His altruistic qualities with egoistic attributes, and %0a%3c can then come into balance with the person seeking connection with Him. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Upper Part elevates the Malchut-Midat HaDin to the level of His Galgalta %0a%3c ve Eynaim. As a result, His AHP acquires egoistic qualities. In this manner, His %0a%3c AHP "descends" to the lower part (the spiritual level of the seeker) and comes %0a%3c into a state of equivalence with the qualities of the lower part. %0a%3c %0a%3c Initially the lower part was not able to perceive the Upper Spiritual State. %0a%3c However, because the Creator hid His highest altruistic qualities behind egoistic %0a%3c ones, He was able to descend to the level of the person so that the person was %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c the ego: %0a%3c the pow %0a%3c %0a%3c In ( %0a%3c %0a%3c closest %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ves and %0a%3c we feel %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Raising a Prayer %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 485 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c that %0a%3c a the %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c re or %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c se we perceive higher qualities as being egoistic, we are unable to truly %0a%3c essence. It appears that there is nothing positive in the spiritual tha %0a%3c asure, inspiration, confidence, or tranquility. %0a%3c %0a%3c precisely at this point that we have an opportunity to exercise %0a%3c llpower. We may, instead, declare that the absence of pleasure and taste in %0a%3c spiritual and in Kabbalah is because of the Creator's deliberate concealment for %0a%3c our own sake. Because we do not yet possess the necessary spiritual qualities, it %0a%3c is therefore impossible for us to perceive the Upper spiritual pleasures; rather, %0a%3c our earthly desires are governed by egoism. %0a%3c %0a%3c tied for beginners to understand that they are given depression %0a%3c %0a%3c m. %0a%3c %0a%3c relief to the Creator, they may study, or %0a%3c t such people do not experience pleasure %0a%3c aspirations is directed from Above. %0a%3c %0a%3c This gives them the free will to conclude that their lack of pleasure comes %0a%3c from a lack of appropriate altruistic qualities in themselves. Hence, the Upper %0a%3c One must hide His true qualities from them. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, we must remember that the first stage of perceiving the spiritual %0a%3c is the feeling of spiritual deprivation. If the lower part is capable of realizing that %0a%3c the Upper One is concealing Himself because of their incongruity of qualities, %0a%3c and if that lower part asks for help to correct its own egoism by raising a p %0a%3c (MAN), then the Upper Part partially reveals Himself (lifts His AHP) and display: %0a%3c His true qualities, which prior to this moment, were disguised beneath egi %0a%3c %0a%3c As a result, spiritual pleasure also becomes apparent. Thus, the lower part %0a%3c begins to experience the grandeur and the spiritual pleasure felt by the Higher %0a%3c Being, Who possesses spiritual altruistic qualities. %0a%3c %0a%3c Because the Upper Part elevated His altruistic qualities in the eyes of the %0a%3c individual, He thus elevated the individual to the middle of His State (He lifted %0a%3c GE of the lower together with His own AHP). %0a%3c %0a%3c This spiritual state is known as a person's "lesser spiritual level" (Katnut). %0a%3c e Upper Part, in a way, elevates the lower part to His own spiritual level by %0a%3c ing both His grandeur and the grandeur of altruistic qualities. By seeing %0a%3c magnificence of the spiritual and comparing it to the material, we may %0a%3c ally rise above our world. %0a%3c %0a%3c en we perceive the spiritual, regardless of our will, our egoistic qualities %0a%3c ged into altruistic ones, that is, into the qualities of the Creator. In %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 486 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ow the lower part to take complete possession of the Higher %0a%3c pper Part wholly reveals Himself and all His qualities to that lc %0a%3c g He reveals his Grandeur, makes Gadlut. %0a%3c %0a%3c point, the person perceives the Upper Part as the One anc %0a%3c overeign of everything in the universe. At the same time, the %0a%3c part grasps the highest knowledge of the purpose of creation and %0a%3c Upper's dominion. %0a%3c %0a%3c It becomes clear to the lower part that there is no other way to conduct %0a%3c oneself than in the way prescribed by Kabbalah. Thus, the lower part's reason %0a%3c now requires proper action. As a result of this clear awareness of the Creator, %0a%3c one must deal with the contradiction between faith and knowledge, between %0a%3c right and the left lines. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Now, having acquired altruistic qualities (Katnut), the lower part prefers to %0a%3c )roceed only by means of faith in the strength of the Creator. This serves as %0a%3c ication of the seeker's sincere desire to come closer to the Cres %0a%3c %0a%3c ;r, the Creator's revelation of His grandeur (Gadlut) nov %0a%3c advancing by faith. Consequently, the individual must willing %0a%3c se with the acquired knowledge. %0a%3c %0a%3c len one pleads to proceed blindly, relying only on one's faith %0a%3c magnificence of the Creator, rather than by realizing His power and grandeur, %0a%3c and only by using reason in proportion to one's faith, the Creator is compelled %0a%3c to limit His disclosure. When such an action compels the Creator to diminish %0a%3c His disclosure of His general dominion, His omnipotence, and His Light (Ohr %0a%3c Hochma), this is called "the screen of Hirik." %0a%3c %0a%3c Through this screen, we are able to diminish the revelation of the Upper %0a%3c reason (the left line) to the point at which this revelation can be balanced with %0a%3c the right line. The correct correlation between faith and knowledge %0a%3c "spiritual balance," %0a%3c %0a%3c idividuals, determir %0a%3c lith and knowledg %0a%3c the middle line." %0a%3c %0a%3c aled knowledge (the left line) that ' %0a%3c our faith (the right line), by proceeding by faith above reason (the middle line) %0a%3c added onto those spiritual qualities that we possessed before, in the state of Katn %0a%3c The newlv acquired spiritual level is known as Gadlut, %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ig big ; %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c V? %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Raising a Prayer %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 487 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c After the first complete spiritual level has been attained, we will bee %0a%3c equal in qualities to the very first (the lowest) state of the spiritual ladder, %0a%3c mentioned earlier, all the states, or steps of the ladder, overlap with each ot %0a%3c %0a%3c Having reached the first level, we may discover the presence of a hi %0a%3c level within us. Using the same principle as when advancing to the first level, we %0a%3c can proceed step by step to the goal of creation— complete unification with the %0a%3c Creator on the Highest level. %0a%3c %0a%3c An essential part of our spiritual ascent is a special process that requires %0a%3c that, on discovering a greater evil within us, we ask the Creator to grant us the %0a%3c trength to overcome that evil. We then receive strength in the form of a greate %0a%3c iritual Light. %0a%3c %0a%3c This continues until we actually reach the original level and size o %0a%3c uls: at that point, our egoism is completely corrected and filled with Light. %0a%3c %0a%3c en we are distracted by outside thoughts, we feel that thoughts obs %0a%3c m ascertaining the spiritual, because our strength and minds are wasted on %0a%3c extraneous concerns, while our hearts become filled with petty desires. At times %0a%3c like this, we lose faith in the fact that only the Kabbalah contains the true life. %0a%3c %0a%3c Once we overcome this condition, we come out of our state and move into %0a%3c the Light, receiving a Higher Light that helps us ascend further. In this manner, %0a%3c our extraneous thoughts work to help us in our spiritual advancement. %0a%3c %0a%3c We can overcome obstacles only with the help of the Creator. We can only %0a%3c ork on something if we perceive some personal benefit in the task. However, %0a%3c odies, hearts and intellects do not understand what benefits can result %0a%3c ism. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, as soon as we try to make even the slightest altruistic move, we lose %0a%3c all strength of the mind, heart and body. We are left with nothing else but to turn %0a%3c to the Creator and ask Him for help. In this way, unwillingly and without any free %0a%3c choice, we advance toward the Creator until we merge with Him completely. %0a%3c %0a%3c The lower half of the Higher spiritual object is found within the Upper half %0a%3c of the lower spiritual object. In the lower object, the screen (Masach) is found in %0a%3c e eye area. This is known as "spiritual blindness," because in such a state only %0a%3c ; lower half of the Higher object is visible to us, since the screen of the lower %0a%3c iritual object conceals part of the Higher spiritual object. %0a%3c %0a%3c igher spiritual object drops its screen to the lower one, then reveals itself %0a%3c to the lower object, which in turn begins to view the Higher object as the Higher %0a%3c One views itself. As a result, the lower object receives the state of fullness (Gadlut). %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 488 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c er object, then, sees that the Higher One is in a "great" state, and %0a%3c igher object's prior concealment and apparent manifestation as %0a%3c lall" state (Katnut), was done exclusively for the benefit of the lower one. In i %0a%3c the lower object could become aware of the importance of the Higher 1 %0a%3c %0a%3c A person in the right line (Kav Yamin) is happy with his lot (Chafetz Hesed). %0a%3c This is called a "small spiritual state" (Katnut), because a person feels no need %0a%3c for the Torah. He does not feel evil, egoism within himself, and without the %0a%3c need for self-correction, he needs no Torah. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, he needs the left line {Kav Smol). He has to critically appraise his stat %0a%3c (Heshbon Nefesh), decide what he wants from the Creator and from himself, ar %0a%3c ;r he understands the Torah and advances toward the goal of creatic %0a%3c le sees his genuine state and is obliged to integrate it in the right line, %0a%3c other words, he has to be content with what he has and be pleased with his sta %0a%3c as if he has everything that he wishes. %0a%3c %0a%3c In the left line, which brings about suffering as a result of the absence of %0a%3c the desired, a need is awakened for the help of the Creator, which comes in the %0a%3c form of Light of the soul. %0a%3c %0a%3c In the right line, in a state when a person desires nothing for the self, there %0a%3c exists only the Light of Mercy (Ohr Hassadim), the joy from the similarity in %0a%3c spiritual qualities. But this state is not perfect, because it lacks knowledge and %0a%3c the understanding of the inner meaning. In the left line there is no perfect %0a%3c because the Light of Wisdom can illuminate only if there is con %0a%3c qualities between the Light received and the recipient of the Light. %0a%3c %0a%3c The congruence results in Ohr Hassadim, which is found in the right li %0a%3c Spiritual gains can be made only by having a desire. But the right line has no %0a%3c desire for anything. All the desires are concentrated in the left line. Howeve %0a%3c the desired cannot be received into the egoistic desires. %0a%3c %0a%3c Thus, it is necessary to unite these two qualities so that the Light of %0a%3c leasure of the left line can enter the Light of altruistic %0a%3c f the middle line will illuminate thi %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c igr %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c e, and tne Lignt ot %0a%3c thout the Light of the right line, the Light of the left is %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The ascent from our world, in which we do not consciously perceive AHP %0a%3c of the Upper One, occurs in the following way: %0a%3c %0a%3c All of one's thoughts about the Creator and spirituality constitute his %0a%3c contact with AHP of the Upper One. How can this Upper Partzuf descend to %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Raising a Prayer %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 489 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c him? Only by equalizing one's desires (properties) with it. All of man's thoughts %0a%3c and desires (or lack thereof), with regard to the spiritual, constitute his contact %0a%3c with the Upper One. When man feels a lack of desire for spirituality, it means %0a%3c that the Upper Partzuf descended and entered him, equalized itself with him; %0a%3c hence, man feels spiritual emptiness. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is precisely in this state of not being drawn to the spiritual that man %0a%3c should tell himself that it only seems to him this way, whereas in truth, by faith %0a%3c above reason, he desires and acts for the sake of nearing the spiritual. In other %0a%3c words, if, in the state when the Upper One "falls" (spiritual values lose their %0a%3c significance) in his eyes, one can nonetheless aspire to spirituality, he thereby %0a%3c binds, connects himself to AHP of the Upper One. This is because AHP of the %0a%3c Upper One deliberately degraded its properties and assumed an outward form %0a%3c similar to the properties (desires) of man. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, as soon as one can establish contact with AHP of the Upper One %0a%3c (even if it appears to him absolutely unattractive, precisely because it lowers its %0a%3c properties to man's level), this AHP of the Upper One immediately elevates %0a%3c man to its GE. Thus, man ascends to a Higher Degree. %0a%3c %0a%3c "Piercing through the air" means that the air boundary, consisting of Bina %0a%3c and ZON of the Upper Degree, created as a result of Malchut's ascent to Bina, is %0a%3c pierced by Malchut's descent from Bina to her place, for then the air rises above %0a%3c the firmament and reaches GAR (GE) of the degree. %0a%3c %0a%3c Thus occurs the piercing of the firmaments. For the firmaments constitute %0a%3c the borders of new ends, which appeared because the air (Bina and ZON) was %0a%3c pushed off from its own degree to a lower one, and was not allowed to return %0a%3c to its degree. Hence, the firmament is pierced from Malchut's descent, and no %0a%3c longer prevents Bina and ZON from ascending and joining that degree. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c K %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c GE of the Upper one %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c H %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Firmament %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c B %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ZA %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c K %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c AHP of Upper one (Air) + GE of Lower one %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c M %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c H %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c B %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ZA %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c AHP of of the Lower one %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c M %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 490 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 1. Malchut ascended to Bina = firmament. %0a%3c %0a%3c 2. Malchut descends back. This creates a passage for AHP to its GE. Thus, %0a%3c the entrances for the lower degree are opened: due to Malchut's descent to her %0a%3c place and the piercing through the firmaments, Bina and ZON ascend to a %0a%3c Higher Degree above the firmament together with the lower degree that they %0a%3c were with during their descent. %0a%3c %0a%3c In other words, the Upper One deliberately opened up the entrances to %0a%3c enable the lower degree to ascend to a Higher Degree, and not for Bina and %0a%3c ZON (AHP of the Upper One), who simply return to their place. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Light that lowers Malchut from Bina to her own place at the end of the %0a%3c ten Sefirot stems from Partzufim AB-SAG. These are the Partzufim Hochma and %0a%3c Bina of the world of AK. Although the second restriction— Malchut's ascent to %0a%3c Bina— occurred in Partzuf Bina of the world of AK, the Partzufim Bina (SAG) and %0a%3c Hochma (AB) of the world of AK were unaffected by it, and Malchut remains in %0a%3c her place at the end of the ten Sefirot. %0a%3c %0a%3c Only the Creator Himself, meaning the properties of the Light, can correct %0a%3c and transform man's egoistic properties to altruistic. Indeed, man is simply %0a%3c unable to pull himself out of his current state "by his own hair," as from birth %0a%3c he has absolutely no spiritual strength (desires). Hence, only the Upper Light %0a%3c correct him. And it can only be Ohr Hochma, for this is the Light tl %0a%3c itor emanates. Ohr Hochma, unrestricted by Tzimtzum Bet, is locatec %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, when one raises his MAN (prayer), it reaches the Highest %0a%3c Partzufim of the world of Atzilut, which turn to SAG-Bina-Ima (mother), who %0a%3c in turn appeals to AB-Hochma-Aba (father), receives Ohr Hochma from him and %0a%3c passes it to her children— the souls of the righteous, those who wish to become %0a%3c righteous and to ascend spiritually. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, when HochmaAB unites with Bina-SAG in the world of AK, this %0a%3c Light (Ohr AB-SAG) descends from Partzuf Bina de AK to Partzuf Bina de Atzilut, %0a%3c called EKYEH = Ale£>h-He;y-Yo%3ciHe;y. Partzuf Bina de Atzilut sends the Light to all %0a%3c the degrees of the worlds of BYA. Upon attaining a particular Partzuf, this Light %0a%3c lowers the Malchut of each degree (that ascended to Bina) from the degree of %0a%3c Bina to her previous place. %0a%3c %0a%3c Starting with AVI, all the Partzufim are in the state of Katnut: AHP of the %0a%3c Upper Partzuf is inside GE of the lower one. The received Ohr Hochma descends %0a%3c to him who raised MAN, thus evoking Gadlut in all the Partzufim, through which %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Raising a Prayer %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 491 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c the Light descends to him. The Light descends to each Partzuf along his personal %0a%3c path, which is precisely what connects everyone, each soul, to the Creator. %0a%3c %0a%3c World of AK %0a%3c %0a%3c Keter - Galgalta %0a%3c Hochma-AB %0a%3c Bina - SAG %0a%3c %0a%3c ZA-MAEIyon %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut - BON Elyon %0a%3c %0a%3c World of Atzilut %0a%3c %0a%3c Keter -Atik %0a%3c %0a%3c Hochma-AA %0a%3c %0a%3c Bina- AVI = EKYEH %0a%3c ZA %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut %0a%3c %0a%3c World of Beria %0a%3c World of Yetzira %0a%3c World of Assiya %0a%3c Our World %0a%3c %0a%3c This is why the name EKYEH is referred to as the ruler of air that moves the %0a%3c boundary of air because of Malchut 's descent from Bina to her previous place. %0a%3c Each degree and each world consists of four Sefirot H-B-ZA-M, each of which %0a%3c Consists of its own individual ten Sefirot, where, as a result of Malchut's ascent to %0a%3c Bina in each degree, Bina-ZA-Malchut of each degree fell to a lower degree. %0a%3c %0a%3c Thus, there are four kinds of airspace in each world that are governed by %0a%3c the three names of EKYEH: EKYEH in the air of Hesed, EKYEH in the air of %0a%3c Gevura, and EKYEH in the air of Tifferet. Malchut receives from them, and all %0a%3c three names govern in her air together. %0a%3c %0a%3c The triple name, EKYEH, comprises twelve letters. This twelve-letter name %0a%3c rules in the air by lowering Malchut from Bina to her previous place, returning %0a%3c Bina and ZON (called "air"), who fell to a lower degree, back to the degree above %0a%3c the firmament. For Malchut's ascent to Bina created an entrance, to enable the %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c These Partzufim %0a%3c channel the Light of %0a%3c AB-SAG from %0a%3c SAG of AK %0a%3c %0a%3c down to AVI de Atzilut %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 492 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c lower one rise to the Upper Degree as soon as it opens, i.e., during Malchut's %0a%3c return to her place. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, when the prophet Eliyahu (a particular spiritual degree) wished to %0a%3c soar to the sky, Malchut of each degree ascended to Bina of the corresponding %0a%3c degree, while Bina and ZON of this degree fell to the lower degree, and a %0a%3c firmament was formed between them. It turned out that each degree doubled: %0a%3c now it contained its own degree, as well as Bina and ZON of the Upper Degree, %0a%3c who fell and clothed the lower degree. %0a%3c %0a%3c This occurred at each degree of the worlds of ABYA, down to the lowest %0a%3c one: Bina and ZON of the Sefira Malchut of the world of Assiya fell and emerged %0a%3c in our world below Malchut. Malchut de Assiya ends at its firmament, which is a %0a%3c new end, in Bina. Also, this degree doubled, as Bina and ZON of the Sefira Yesod %0a%3c of the world of Assiya fell and clothed in its degree. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c GEde Bina %0a%3c of the World of Atzilut %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c AHP de Bina %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c GEdeZA %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c AHPdeZA %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c GE de Malchut %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Parsa %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Parsa %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c AHP de Malchut %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c GE de Keter of the World of Beria %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c AHP de Keter %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c GE de Hochma %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c etc. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c GE de Bina %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c of the World of Assiya %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Machsom %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c AHP de Bina %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c GEdeZA %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c AHPdeZA %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c GE de Malchut of the World of Assiya %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c / %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c AHPde Malchut %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c (GE) of the Human Soul %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c in our World %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c In the diagram, GE of man in our world are put in brackets, for he who %0a%3c exists (spiritually, not with his body) at the degree of our world has no desires of %0a%3c bestowal. Hence, it is said that he who exists with his properties in this world, %0a%3c in egoism, has only a point in his heart, from which he can start his spiritual %0a%3c development. %0a%3c %0a%3c Similarly, the Sefira Yesod of the world of Assiya also ends with its firmament %0a%3c and contains Bina and ZON of the Sefira Hod de Assiya. The Sefira Netzah de %0a%3c Assiya also doubled, and so on up to Bina de Atzilut. This is why the prophet %0a%3c Eliyahu rose up and united with Bina and ZON, who fell from Malchut de Assiya %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Raising a Prayer %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 493 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c to this world. He equalized with them and clothed in them, whereupon they %0a%3c became like him— reached his degree. %0a%3c %0a%3c Not all ten Sefirot of the world of Assiya are shown in the above diagram, %0a%3c but as it was previously mentioned, each degree is divided into its own GE and %0a%3c AHP. Man's task is to find AHP of the Upper One within him, and connect to %0a%3c it, merge with it in all of his sensations and desires. %0a%3c %0a%3c Subsequently, the twelve-letter name exerted its influence (thanks to the %0a%3c Light AB-SAG), causing Malchut de Assiya to descend from Bina of Malchut de %0a%3c Assiya to its place, Malchut de Malchut, the end of the ten Sefirot. And as before, %0a%3c Bina and ZON ascended to their degree above the firmament of Malchut. And %0a%3c since Eliyahu's properties were already merged with this air (with the ascending %0a%3c Bina and ZON), he rose together with them above the firmament of Malchut, as %0a%3c he was similar to them. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c etc. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c GE de Hochma %0a%3c of the World of Assiya %0a%3c %0a%3c "ahp" %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c GE de Bina %0a%3c AHP de Bina %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Sefira Yesod %0a%3c %0a%3c of the World of Assiya %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c GEdeZA %0a%3c AHPdeZA %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Sefira Malchut %0a%3c of the World of Assiya %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c GE de Malchut %0a%3c AHP "de Malc"hut|(GE) of the Human Soul in our World %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c And since he rose above the firmament of Malchut de Assiya, he entered the %0a%3c air (AHP) of Yesod de Assiya, i.e., Bina and ZON of Yesod that fell down there. %0a%3c Then he merged in his desires with this air and is considered to have clothed in %0a%3c it, for they were previously at the same degree. Then the influence of the twelve- %0a%3c letter name lowered Malchut from Bina of Yesod de Assiya to her place at the end %0a%3c of the ten individual Sefirot of Yesod de Assiya. %0a%3c %0a%3c After that, Bina and ZON (the air of Yesod) ascended above the firmament %0a%3c of Yesod. And since Eliyahu had already merged with this air, he (man's soul, his %0a%3c desire) too ascended above the firmament of Yesod de Assiya, due to his concord %0a%3c with them. %0a%3c %0a%3c And because he rose above the firmament of Yesod de Assiya, he met with %0a%3c the air (AHP) of Hod de Assiya, i.e., Bina and ZON of Hod de Assiya that fell down %0a%3c there. Subsequently, he merged in his desires with this air and clothed it, for %0a%3c they were previously at the same place (spiritually similar to one another). %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 494 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c As soon as man merges in his properties with AHP of the Upper One, the %0a%3c influence of the twelve-letter name (the descent of the Light of AB-SAG from %0a%3c Above) brings Malchut back (gives strength to the screen) to the end of the ten %0a%3c individual Sefirot of Hod de Assiya. And the air, its Bina and ZON, returned to %0a%3c their place above the firmament of Hod de Assiya. They took Eliyahu (man's soul, %0a%3c his desires) with them, for he had merged with them, and they elevated him to %0a%3c the firmament of Hod de Assiya in view of his similarity with them. %0a%3c %0a%3c And when he was already in the firmament of Hod de Assiya, he met with %0a%3c the air (AHP) of Netzah de Assiya and merged with it in his properties. When the %0a%3c influence of the twelve-letter name (the Light of correction, AB-SAG, that was sent %0a%3c by the Creator) brought Malchut back to her place (Malchut descended from Bina %0a%3c to Malchut of this Sefira, because she received strength from the Light to resist %0a%3c the egoistic desires of AHP and make them altruistic), the air of Netzah ascended %0a%3c above the firmament, and being merged with Eliyahu (man's soul), took him with %0a%3c it. Being already in the firmament of Net^ah, he met with the air of Tifferet and so %0a%3c on, until he ascended with this air above the firmament of Tifferet de Assiya. %0a%3c %0a%3c In the same way, the air (AHP) of each degree rose higher, up to the Highest %0a%3c Degree of the world of Assiya. From there, it rose to Malchut de Yetzira, and from %0a%3c there— one step at a time— along all the degrees of the world of Yet^zra and the %0a%3c world of Beria, up to the Heavens (ZA) of the world of Atzilut. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is therefore said about the prophet Eliyahu that the Creator's spirit %0a%3c (the Light AB-SAG) elevated him (merged with AHP of the Upper One) to the %0a%3c Heavens: spirit means Ruach, Sefirot Bina and ZON of the Upper Degree, called %0a%3c "air," that fell down to the lower degree. And this air (spirit) elevates one from %0a%3c a lower degree to a Higher One through all the individual degrees, from the %0a%3c lowest degree (So/ de Assiya) up to the world of Atzilut. %0a%3c %0a%3c An Upper Degree is regarded as the Creator of the lower degree: it creates %0a%3c it, vitalizes it with Light, and governs it. At each degree, man considers the next %0a%3c Highest spiritual degree with regard to him as the Creator. As Rabbi Zushe said: %0a%3c "Every day I have a new Creator." In other words, as man ascends to a Higher %0a%3c Degree (which he calls "day" or "Light"), he thereby reveals a new property of %0a%3c the Creator in this Higher Degree. %0a%3c %0a%3c The air of each of the four sides of the world (in Sefirot Hesed-Gevura-Tifferet- %0a%3c Malchui) has its own rulers, who hold the keys to the activation of the twelve- %0a%3c letter name so as to lower Malchut from Bina to her own place. The ascending %0a%3c order of these four kinds of air is as follows: West-Malchut, East-Ti//eret (including %0a%3c NHY), North-Gei/ura, and South-Hesed. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Raising a Prayer %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 495 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Hesed %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c - SOUTH %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Gevura %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c NORTH %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ZA %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c - EAST %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut - WEST %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c It is not the rulers that raise a prayer (the desire that man feels in the very %0a%3c depths of his heart) from air to air, and then from firmament to firmament. %0a%3c The air raises a prayer from the firmament, each air to its firmament: first, the %0a%3c prayer ascends to the air of the Sefira Malchut de Assiya, i.e., to Bina and ZON %0a%3c (AHP) that fell from Malchut de Assiya down to our world. They resemble the %0a%3c prayer itself, for this air (AHP) is similar to a prayer (the Upper One lowered %0a%3c itself deliberately to equalize its properties with the lower one); hence, they %0a%3c merge as one degree. %0a%3c %0a%3c Then the one that rules there, Zvuliel (Zebuliel), activates the twelve-letter %0a%3c name, which lowers Malchut from Bina de Assiya to her place. This causes the %0a%3c air to return to its degree and rise above the firmament of the world of Assiya. %0a%3c And since the air became similar to the degree of the actual prayer, it also takes %0a%3c the prayer along with it, raising it above the firmament of the Sefira Malchut de %0a%3c Assiya. This is similar to the ascent of Prophet Eliyahu. %0a%3c %0a%3c And since the prayer ascended to the firmament of the world of Assiya, it %0a%3c meets the air of Yesod de Assiya that fell there, as in the case of Eliyahu. It also %0a%3c encounters the ruler of the air of the East, Gazaria (Gazardiel), because East %0a%3c designates the Sefira Tifferet (ZA is often called Tifferet, as the properties of this %0a%3c Sefira dominate and determine all the properties of ZA), which includes the %0a%3c Sefira Yesod, for Tifferet includes Sefirot NHY. %0a%3c %0a%3c This ruler activates the twelve-letter name and lowers Malchut from Bina %0a%3c de Yesod to her place, which causes the air of Yesod to ascend to its degree, %0a%3c the firmament of Yesod. By merging with the prayer into one degree via %0a%3c equivalence of form, he takes it with him and raises it above the firmament %0a%3c of Yesod. Then, a similar action occurs in the air and firmament of Sefirot %0a%3c Netzah, Hod, and Tifferet. %0a%3c %0a%3c Since the prayer ascended to the firmament of Tifferet, it encounters the %0a%3c Northern air, i.e., Bina and ZON of Gevura de Assiya that fell there. There it %0a%3c unites with this air into one degree. Then the ruler of the North, Petachia %0a%3c (Petahyah), activates the twelve-letter name and lowers Malchut from Bina to her %0a%3c place. Consequently, the air returns, ascends to the firmament of Gevura and %0a%3c takes with it the prayer, which merged with it into one degree during its fall. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 496 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Since the prayer has already reached the firmament of Gevura, it meets with %0a%3c the Southern air, Bina and ZON of Hesed de Assiya that fell there, and merges %0a%3c with this air. Then the ruler of the Southern air, named Pisgania (Pesagniyah), %0a%3c Hesed de Assiya, activates the twelve-letter name and lowers Malchut from Bina of %0a%3c Hesed de Assiya to her place. The Southern air returns and ascends to its degree %0a%3c in the sixth firmament, Hesed de Assiya, called "south." %0a%3c %0a%3c Since the prayer has reached the sixth firmament, it encounters the air that %0a%3c fell from the seventh firmament, which is Bina that includes GAR, and the prayer %0a%3c merges with this air into one degree. When the twelve-letter name lowers Malchut %0a%3c from Bina (the seventh firmament) to her place, the air returns to its degree (the %0a%3c seventh firmament) and takes the prayer with it, as they merge during its fall. %0a%3c %0a%3c Since the prayer has reached the seventh firmament, it encounters the air %0a%3c that fell from Malchut de Yetzira, and merges with it. Next, the general ruler, %0a%3c Sandalphon, who governs the entire world of Assiya, takes it and activates the %0a%3c twelve-letter name, which lowers Malchut from Malchut de Yetzira to her place. %0a%3c And the air ascends and returns to its degree, the firmament of Malchut de Yetzira, %0a%3c takes the prayer with it, and elevates it to the firmament of Malchut de Yetzira. %0a%3c %0a%3c In exactly the same way, the prayer ascends through all seven Heichalot %0a%3c (halls) of the worlds Yetzira and Beria up to the world of Atzilut. This clarifies %0a%3c the question posed in the beginning: how can a prayer ascend from the very %0a%3c lowest degree of the world of Assiya to the world of Atzilut, for no degree can %0a%3c ascend above itself? From the aforesaid, it follows that since the prayer merges %0a%3c with the first air that fell from Malchut de Assiya to our world, it is exactly this %0a%3c air that elevated them to the firmament of Malchut, whereas the air of Yesod %0a%3c de Assiya was elevated to the firmament of Yesod, and so forth. In other words, %0a%3c the air with which the prayer merges and ascends elevates it to Malchut of the %0a%3c world of Atzilut. %0a%3c %0a%3c He who falls from Malchut de Assiya to our world descends from the spiritual %0a%3c degree called Malchut de Assiya to the spiritual degree called our world. Of course, %0a%3c this in no way refers to the physical existence in our world. AHP of the Upper %0a%3c Degree are considered fallen when one feels in his heart (in the center of all of %0a%3c his desires) the desire to attain the spiritual, merge with it, and annul his egoistic %0a%3c properties because they harm and impede his advancement. %0a%3c %0a%3c One should not think that the fall of Bina and ZON to our world from the %0a%3c world of Assiya can be experienced by anyone. And only he who felt this way %0a%3c and was then able to make a sufficient amount of quantitative and qualitative %0a%3c efforts, merits being elevated above our world by AHP of the Upper One. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Raising a Prayer %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 497 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c On the Southern side (Hesed), there is he who governs the air of that side, %0a%3c and his assistants. His name is Pisgania, and he holds the keys to the air of %0a%3c this side. All those who suffer pray to their Creator from the depths of their %0a%3c broken hearts (the very sensation of suffering constitutes a prayer, and requires %0a%3c no words). If their speech (desires) is worthy, it ascends to the air of this side, %0a%3c and the ruler accepts and kisses it ("embrace," "kiss," and Zivug are forms of %0a%3c spiritual union of Partzufim), and then declares: "The Creator will be merciful %0a%3c and will spare you in His mercy." %0a%3c %0a%3c All of the holy rulers (Ohr Hochma is called holy) and their assistants of that %0a%3c side rise together with him. The letters of the Creator's holy name, of the twelve- %0a%3c letter name EKYEH soar: four letters Aleph-Hey-Yod-Hey on each side, which %0a%3c rule the corresponding sides of air. They ascend on this side of the air to the %0a%3c Southern firmament, Hesed (the sixth firmament), to the ruler of the firmament %0a%3c of the Southern side, named Anafiel. %0a%3c %0a%3c On the Northern side (Gevura) there is Petachia, who governs the air with %0a%3c his assistants. If he who prays for his enemies and haters, i.e., for those who %0a%3c make him suffer is righteous, then as the speech of his prayer rises to the air %0a%3c of that side, the ruler accepts his heart's speech and kisses it (unites it with his %0a%3c properties so as to raise it higher). %0a%3c %0a%3c The air that comes from the North stirs and calls upon all the firmaments, %0a%3c and they all take this speech, raise it to the Northern, fifth firmament, kiss %0a%3c it and say: "The Lord will cast your enemies down and take them away from %0a%3c your face." This occurs in the following order: after the governor of the air had %0a%3c accepted the prayer and kissed it, which means that it merged with the degree %0a%3c of the air and the ruler, the air stirs on the Northern side (the new end that %0a%3c Malchut made as she ascended to Bina, called Techum— space, from the word %0a%3c Tohu— chaos), and the twelve-letter name lowers Malchut from Bina of Gevura de %0a%3c Assiya back to her place. %0a%3c %0a%3c The air that fell into the restrictions (Dinim) of this space is aroused by %0a%3c the desire to rise to the firmament of Gevura. Also, all the degrees that merged %0a%3c with it during its fall rise along with it to the firmament of Gevura due to their %0a%3c similarity to it. Similarly, the prayer that was merged with it during its fall ascends %0a%3c along with it to the fifth firmament. %0a%3c %0a%3c The order of the ascent (offering up of a prayer) starts from here: it ascends %0a%3c and pierces through the air (AHP), which fell from Malchut de Assiya to our %0a%3c world, and ascends with it to the first firmament, the firmament of Malchut de %0a%3c Assiya. The prayer ascends and approaches the ruler (in its properties), who was %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 498 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c appointed to control the Western side, Malchut. There are nine entrances where %0a%3c the assistants to the ruler, Zvuliel stand. %0a%3c %0a%3c The ten Sefirot of Malchut herself have nine (not ten) entrances, for a %0a%3c restriction to receive the Light is imposed on Malchut of the Sefira Malchut, and %0a%3c it is connected to Yesod de Malchut. Hence, Yesod and Malchut of Malchut share %0a%3c the same entrance. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, a question arises: "Why do all the parts of the air have one ruler for %0a%3c the air and a separate ruler for the firmament? For example, on the Eastern side %0a%3c Gazaria controls the Eastern air and Shimshiel controls the Eastern firmament %0a%3c (Tifferet, the fourth firmament). Similarly, Pisgania controls the Southern air on %0a%3c the Southern side, and Anafiel controls the Southern firmament. And on the %0a%3c Northern side, the ruler Petachia governs the Northern air, and Gadriel is in %0a%3c charge of the Northern firmament. So why does only Malchut have one general %0a%3c ruler, called Zvuliel, who governs both the air and the firmament?" %0a%3c %0a%3c The reason is that due to Malchut's ascent to Bina, Bina and ZON of each %0a%3c degree fall to a lower degree, the degree of air. However, only the lower part of %0a%3c Bina (ZAT or VAK de Bina) falls, whereas Keter, Hochma, and the Upper half of %0a%3c Bina (GAR de Bina) remain at the same degree. Only the lower half of Bina, ZAT %0a%3c de Bina (ZA and Malchut) fell from this degree and became air. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Keter %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c GE %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Hochma %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c q- GAR of Bina %0a%3c Bina ZATofB~ina %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c — Parsa = Malchut — %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ZA %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c AHP %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, two separate rulers were needed: one for the Upper Degree %0a%3c remaining above the firmament, and the other— for the lower half of the degree %0a%3c that fell and turned into air. The degree (ten Sefirot) of Malchut, from whom %0a%3c all nine lower Sefirot fell to the lower degree during Malchut's ascent to Bina, %0a%3c retained only one Sefira Keter de Malchut, which remained as a point below %0a%3c Yesod de ZA. %0a%3c %0a%3c Nevertheless, even this point refers more to the Sefira Yesod, which is superior %0a%3c to Malchut, because its properties are more similar to Yesod. And since all of %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Raising a Prayer %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 499 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut refers to the properties of air (except for her individual Keter), she has %0a%3c only one ruler. %0a%3c %0a%3c The ruler wishes to act in the firmament in the daylight, but does not %0a%3c receive permission until the moon rises, i.e., until nightfall, when all the rulers %0a%3c and forces emerge. And when the day breaks (the Upper Light starts shining), %0a%3c they all ascend (the spiritual properties become corrected and improve under %0a%3c the Light's influence) to the Highest of the nine entrances, the point of Keter de %0a%3c Malchut, which remained at its degree above the firmament (Parsa). %0a%3c %0a%3c And when the prayer ascends, it enters through this Upper entrance, and all %0a%3c the rulers with their assistants emerge from it, led by their Supreme ruler, Zvuliel, %0a%3c the only ruler of the air of this Upper entrance, who is above the firmament of %0a%3c Malchut de Assiya. They all emerge, kiss the prayer, and accompany it up the %0a%3c second firmament of Yesod de Assiya. %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut constitutes the left line— Hochma without Hassadim. Therefore, when %0a%3c she dominates, the Light does not shine and darkness prevails. Hochma cannot %0a%3c shine without Hassadim, which means that when Malchut rules, it is nighttime %0a%3c (not daylight). Indeed, all nine of her lower Sefirot, from which all the rulers (of %0a%3c man) and forces (man's desires) of the left side originate, rule at night. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is why it is said that Malchut descends from Bina to her place, although %0a%3c her nine lower Sefirot remained untouched by the impure force, for Malchut %0a%3c descended from the firmament, which transformed her into air. Even so, they %0a%3c (nine Sefirot) have no power in her place, and must rise above the firmament to the %0a%3c Upper entrance, Keter de Malchut. There they enter the right side (Hassadim), and %0a%3c the prayer ascends with them because of their similarity (in desires, properties), %0a%3c achieved while they were below the firmament (in the state called "our world"). %0a%3c %0a%3c And since the prayer (MAN) rose above the firmament of Malchut (to GE %0a%3c of the Upper One), it encounters the air (AHP of the still Higher One) that fell %0a%3c there from the second firmament. After the descent of Malchut from Bina of %0a%3c Yesod de Assiya to her place, this air ascends to the firmament of Yesod, and takes %0a%3c with it all the rulers, their assistants, and the prayer, which were merged with it %0a%3c during its fall, and elevates all of them to the firmament of Yesod de Assiya. %0a%3c %0a%3c And when the prayer ascends to this firmament (Yesod), the twelve gates %0a%3c of this firmament open up. A special ruler, Ana'el (Anahel), who is in charge %0a%3c of many forces, stands at the twelfth entrance, and when the prayer ascends, %0a%3c proclaims to all the entrances: "Open the gates." And all the entrances open up, %0a%3c and the prayer enters through them. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 500 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c This happens because Tifferet has twelve borders of the diagonal, defined %0a%3c by the Sefirot H-G-T-M, each of which contains three lines of HGT, twelve in %0a%3c all. And all that exists in Tifferet is also present in Yesod, but there these twelve %0a%3c borders are called "twelve gates," through which the prayer enters. %0a%3c %0a%3c And then awakens a very old ruler, who stands at the Southern side. His %0a%3c name is Azriel-Saba, sometimes referred to as Machaniel, for he is responsible %0a%3c for 600,000 groups (camps— Machanot). All the groups have wings and eyes; they %0a%3c stand and listen to all those who are quietly praying, to the prayers that come %0a%3c from the depths of the heart and are directed only to the Creator. Only such %0a%3c prayers are heard by those who have ears. %0a%3c %0a%3c There is a special opening in the Sefira Yesod de Hesed (Supernal mercy) that %0a%3c descends from the right line of Bina. Hence, the ruler of this mercy is called %0a%3c Azriel-Saba. He is called Saba (grandfather), because Hochma and Bina are called %0a%3c "old men." And he is appointed to rule over 600,000 groups (camps), because %0a%3c 600 = 6 x 100, where 6 = HGT NHY Sefirot in Bina. And since each Sefira in Bina %0a%3c is designated by 100, 6 x 100 = 600. And the thousands stem from Ohr Hochma, %0a%3c which shines in each of these Sefirot. Hence, 600 x 1,000 = 600,000 groups. %0a%3c %0a%3c GAR de Tvuna, the lower part (ZAT) of Bina, are called "ears." Only Ohr %0a%3c Hassadim shines in them, without Hochma. VAK de Tvuna are called "eyes," and %0a%3c Ohr Hochma shines in them. %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut and Bina constitute two kinds of air, West and North, which unite %0a%3c and intermix, and form a diagonal, a combination of judgment and mercy that %0a%3c mitigates strictness and judgment. Hence, they hear good words from one who %0a%3c merits it, i.e., they accept one's prayer to the extent of the mercy in the diagonal. %0a%3c Alternatively, they hear bad things about one who does not merit, accepting %0a%3c one's prayer to the extent of the judgment in the diagonal. %0a%3c %0a%3c If man's ears hear the prayer (which means that he speaks not from the %0a%3c depths of his heart, but with his mouth, so outwardly that his ears hear it, but %0a%3c not his heart), no one will accept it Above. Therefore, man must be watchful: %0a%3c no one should hear his prayer, for the speech of the prayer unites in the Upper %0a%3c World, in ZA, and the speech of the Upper World must not be heard. %0a%3c %0a%3c Consider how the Torah is read: one reads and the others keep silent. %0a%3c However, if they all read it out loud, they lessen the faith Above, for the voice and %0a%3c speech of one mingle with the voice and speech of the others, and undermine %0a%3c faith, i.e., Malchut. The voice and speech (ZA is called "voice" and Malchut is %0a%3c called "speech") of one must be similar to the voice and speech of the other. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Raising a Prayer %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 501 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Two reasons are mentioned above as to why a prayer must be speech without %0a%3c voice, unheard by man's ear. The first is that Malchut, who begets people, consists %0a%3c of two points: the Light cannot be received from Malchut with a measure of %0a%3c judgment, whereas the Light can be received from Malchut that is corrected in %0a%3c Bina with a measure of mercy. %0a%3c %0a%3c Similarly, man consists of a combination of these two points. If he merits, %0a%3c the measure of judgment becomes concealed, the measure of mercy is revealed, %0a%3c and he merits receiving the Upper Light. However, if he does not merit, the %0a%3c measure of judgment becomes revealed and the Light disappears from him. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, the Upper ear has an inclined form so as to be able to receive the %0a%3c prayer of man-righteous one, him who merits the concealment of the measure %0a%3c of judgment, so that the listening ear would not arouse judgment, concealed %0a%3c in the speech of the prayer. Hence, if an outsider hears the prayer before it %0a%3c ascends, he evokes the judgment concealed in the speech of the prayer, and it %0a%3c cannot be heard Above. %0a%3c %0a%3c There is another reason for this: the speech of the prayer constitutes parts %0a%3c of Malchut. And he who prays must be a part of Malchut. Hence, the prayer %0a%3c must ascend and be included in the Supernal Malchut, called "speech." Then %0a%3c Malchut unites with ZA (voice) and the prayer is accepted, i.e., the Light is %0a%3c accepted from ZA. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, one must not raise his voice during prayer so as to allow the %0a%3c Supernal voice, the Light of ZA, to descend to the praying person. The speech %0a%3c ascends to Malchut, merges with ZA with the help of Malchut, and receives a %0a%3c completely corrected voice from ZA. As a result, the prayer can receive the Light. %0a%3c It is therefore said that the words of a prayer pronounced by man's voice must %0a%3c not be heard. %0a%3c %0a%3c He who reads the Torah must also be a part of ZA, called "Torah." And the %0a%3c voice of one who reads Torah must be instead of the voice of ZA. Hence, it is %0a%3c forbidden to hear someone else's voice, for it will be the voice of one who exists %0a%3c under judgment, and not under mercy. %0a%3c %0a%3c Thus, the voice of an outsider harms the voice of one who reads the Torah, %0a%3c and Malchut is unable to receive the Light from ZA. Yet, if this is the voice and %0a%3c speech of one man, then the voice, called ZA, and speech, called Malchut, merge %0a%3c into one combination. But if voice and speech of an outsider join the reader's, %0a%3c it will harm him. %0a%3c %0a%3c With regard to everything mentioned above, one can say that only he %0a%3c who approaches the described state can understand what The Zohar narrates. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 502 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Spiritual actions are understood in one's heart, his desires, his properties. If %0a%3c they do not correspond to those that are described above, no explanation of any %0a%3c kind will help. An "outsider" designates man's "foreign" (distant from spiritual %0a%3c aspirations) thoughts and desires. %0a%3c %0a%3c When a quiet, concealed, and secret prayer ascends, the governor Azriel- %0a%3c Saba himself and all of his assistants, who are in charge of the 600,000 groups %0a%3c (camps), and all those who have eyes and ears emerge and kiss the ascending %0a%3c word of the prayer. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is said in the verse: "The Creator's eyes and ears are upon them." %0a%3c The Creator's eyes rest upon the righteous. The Creator's eyes refer to those %0a%3c below who have eyes, meaning the angels that exist in the firmament of Yesod de %0a%3c Assiya. They exist Above, at the degree of GAR, for eyes signify the property of %0a%3c Hochma. However, these eyes are the eyes of the Sefira Yesod, as it is written: "The %0a%3c Creator's eyes rest upon the righteous," as Yesod is called the "righteous one." %0a%3c %0a%3c The third firmament is the Sefirot Net^ah and Hod de Assiya. The prayer %0a%3c ascends to this firmament. The ruler Gadria, who controls this firmament with %0a%3c his assistants, acts three times a day during the ascent of the three lines to the %0a%3c world of Atzilut, when the luminous scepter of Light ascends and descends, but %0a%3c does not stay in one place, for Ohr Hochma of the left line (called the "scepter of %0a%3c Light") wants to shine. %0a%3c %0a%3c The word "scepter" (Hebrew, Sharvit) signifies eyesight, and Ohr Hochma is %0a%3c called the Light of eyesight. The scepter moves three times and conceals itself, %0a%3c because Hochma reveals itself only when the three lines move in the three points: %0a%3c Holam (the dot above the letters), Shuruk (the dot inside the letters), and Hirik %0a%3c (the dot below the letters). %0a%3c %0a%3c When the prayer, which is the middle line, ascends and carries the screen of %0a%3c Hirik, the scepter (the Light of the left line) descends and bows its head before %0a%3c the prayer, designating the concealment of GAR, called "head." This is because %0a%3c the middle line reduces the left line with the help of the screen of Hirik. This %0a%3c third firmament of Sefirot Netzah and Hod de Assiya is called the "firmament of %0a%3c the scepter," for the scepter of Light acts within it. %0a%3c %0a%3c When the prayer ascends, the ruler bows his head before it (diminishes his %0a%3c level) and then strikes the iridescent rock with his scepter. The rock stands at the %0a%3c center (the middle line) of the firmament, and 365 hosts emerge from the rock, %0a%3c which were concealed within it since the Torah descended to the earth. Because %0a%3c they objected to this descent, the Creator reproached them, and they concealed %0a%3c themselves in the rock. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Raising a Prayer %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 503 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Here, by analogy with the aforesaid and in accordance with the definitions %0a%3c of such notions as a scepter, a rock, hosts, Light, concealment, to %0a%3c bow," the reader is offered an opportunity to translate from the language of %0a%3c legends into the language of spiritual actions. And when the reader attains what %0a%3c is written, he will feel it within him! %0a%3c %0a%3c And they do not emerge from there, except for when the prayer ascends. %0a%3c Then they praise the Creator, saying: "Our Creator, how great is Your name %0a%3c upon the earth!" This prayer is called "Great," because it ascends to all these %0a%3c firmaments, and they bow before it. %0a%3c %0a%3c This occurs because the angels that opposed the descent of the Torah (see %0a%3c the article "Heaven and Earth"), i.e., the middle line, to the earth (Malchut and %0a%3c the worlds of BYA), emerge from the left line. And they wanted the left line to %0a%3c dominate in Malchut and in the worlds of BYA, but not the middle one, called %0a%3c the "Torah," which reduces the GAR of the Light of the left line. %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut, called "earth," includes all the worlds of BYA. However, the Creator %0a%3c (middle line) reproached and compelled her to receive the Light of the middle %0a%3c line and conceal herself in the rock, in the forces of judgment, which exist in the %0a%3c middle line that stands at the center of the firmament. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, the prayer can ascend only by activating the left line, namely Bina %0a%3c and ZON that fell to the lower degree, then ascended once more above the %0a%3c firmament, and became the left line. They take the prayer that existed with %0a%3c them during their descent to the lower degree. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is why the ruler receives the scepter, the Light of the left line, for %0a%3c during the ascent of the prayer, the left line shines in his domain. The 365 hosts %0a%3c then awaken and receive the Light of the left line from the scepter. Hence, they %0a%3c exclaim: "The Creator, Our Lord, how great is Your name upon the earth!" for %0a%3c the prayer ascends to this firmament, called "Great," and includes the screen of %0a%3c Hirik of the left line, from the GAR. Thus, they bow their heads, i.e., do not use %0a%3c the GAR of Ohr Hochma, but only VAK. %0a%3c %0a%3c Afterward, the prayer clothes in the Supernal adornments and rises to the %0a%3c fourth firmament, Tifferet. Then the sun (Tifferet) emerges at its level, the Supreme %0a%3c ruler Shimshiel, and the 365 hosts ascend to this firmament along with him. %0a%3c They are called "the days of the sun," for these levels stem from the sun, Tifferet. %0a%3c And they all clothe and adorn Malchut in the Heavens of the Garden of Eden. %0a%3c %0a%3c The prayer pauses there to merge with the air of Gevura of those degrees, %0a%3c because it was not supposed to pause at the previous firmament, NHY, as they %0a%3c are included in Tifferet. And the prayer remains there until all the hosts have %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 504 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c risen with it to the fifth firmament (Gevura), where Gadriel rules; he is in charge %0a%3c of all the hosts of the other nations, for Gevura constitutes the left line, which %0a%3c the other nations hold on to. %0a%3c %0a%3c And when the prayer ascends, carrying within the screen of the middle %0a%3c line (which reduces the left line from GAR to VAK), it shakes him and all of his %0a%3c hosts, and they lose all their strength, emerge and bow their heads, i.e., GAR, %0a%3c and adorn this prayer. %0a%3c %0a%3c They ascend with it to the sixth firmament, Hesed, and the legions and hosts %0a%3c come forth and accept the prayer until they reach the seventy gates, HGT NHYM, %0a%3c each of which consists of ten, as Hesed includes all seven lower Sefirot. The Supreme %0a%3c ruler, Anafiel, stands there and adorns the prayer with seventy adornments. %0a%3c %0a%3c And since the prayer was adorned, all the legions and hosts of all the %0a%3c firmaments that accompanied the prayer from firmament to firmament unite %0a%3c and raise the prayer to the seventh firmament, Bina, which includes GAR. %0a%3c %0a%3c The prayer enters the seventh firmament, and the Supreme ruler Sandalphon, %0a%3c who is in charge of all the guards at the entrances, ushers the prayer into the %0a%3c seven halls of the world of Yetzira. These are the seven halls of the King, the %0a%3c seven halls of Malchut de Atzilut, where ZA rules. %0a%3c %0a%3c When the prayer, adorned with all of these adornments, ascends there, it %0a%3c unites ZA with Malchut, for everything grows with similarity to everything else. %0a%3c And the Creator's name, i.e., Malchut is adorned from Above and from below, %0a%3c and on all sides, as Malchut merges with ZA into one. And then Yesod (the %0a%3c righteous one) fills Malchut with its blessings. %0a%3c %0a%3c Happy is the lot of him who can put his prayer in proper order, so the %0a%3c Creator will clothe in this prayer. He waits until all the prayers of Israel finish %0a%3c ascending and unite into a complete and perfect prayer, whereupon everything %0a%3c will become perfect both Above and below. %0a%3c %0a%3c Besides the prayer, there are the Mitzvot of the Torah that depend on speech %0a%3c and action. There are six Mitzvot that depend on speech: %0a%3c %0a%3c 1. To fear the Great and Mighty Creator; %0a%3c %0a%3c 2. To love the Creator; %0a%3c %0a%3c 3. To bless the Creator; %0a%3c %0a%3c 4. To proclaim the Creator's unity; %0a%3c %0a%3c 5. To bless the nation, which is incumbent on Cohanim (priests); %0a%3c %0a%3c 6. To entrust one's soul with the Creator. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Raising a Prayer %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 505 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Out of the six above-mentioned Mitzvot, the first finds its place in the %0a%3c blessings that King David sang during his offerings in the Torah, where man %0a%3c must fear his Master, for these songs stand in a place called "fear" or Malchut. %0a%3c And all of these written blessings constitute the essence of fear of the Creator, %0a%3c Malchut. And man must sing these songs with his desires in fear. %0a%3c %0a%3c Man must achieve a level of spiritual development where his desires will %0a%3c coincide with what is said in the texts of these blessings. It is impossible to force %0a%3c someone to wish something; all our feelings are the product, the result of our %0a%3c spiritual level. The Light of that degree influences one's egoism and corrects it %0a%3c with the power of that degree. Therefore, man can only ask for correction, but %0a%3c %0a%3c Here we have a list of degrees that man must gradually go through in his %0a%3c correction. These degrees are usually called Mitzvot, and in all there are 620 of %0a%3c them between us and the Creator: 613 Mitzvot of the Torah for Israel (altruism) %0a%3c and seven Mit^ot of the Torah for all the nations (egoism). Here they are %0a%3c expounded in a different way: since the most important is to ask for correction %0a%3c (and if the request is genuine, the answer in the form of Light immediately %0a%3c descends to it), all of man's work on himself, all of his efforts in the study, work %0a%3c and actions are aimed only at the creation of a true request, MAN. Hence, the %0a%3c stages of man's spiritual development are described as his path in prayer; as if %0a%3c he stands and prays, although this process continues within him throughout his %0a%3c life on earth. %0a%3c %0a%3c The second Mitzva: to love the Creator (as it was repeatedly stated, this %0a%3c feeling is the result of correction; see "Introduction to the Study of Ten Sefirot," %0a%3c item 45— the four degrees of sensation of governance, from darkness to love), %0a%3c when in his prayer one reaches Ahavat Olam (great love) and Le El (for the %0a%3c Creator). These two blessings precede the appeal, Shema Israel (Hear, O Israel) %0a%3c and Ve Ahavta Et (and love the Creator), the blessing of the Creator for one's %0a%3c love for Him that follows the appeal Shema Israel. And this is the secret of love %0a%3c for the Creator. %0a%3c %0a%3c The third Mit^i/a: since man reaches a place in the prayer that is called %0a%3c Lehishtabe'ach (blessed is the Creator), he must attain praises and blessings of the %0a%3c Creator in his desire, as in parts of the prayer Yotzer Ohr (He who creates Light) %0a%3c and Yotzer HaMeohrot (maker of the stars). %0a%3c %0a%3c The fourth Mitzva is to proclaim the Creator's unity, i.e., Shema Israel (Hear, %0a%3c O Israel, our Creator is one!). From this point (degree) on, one must express %0a%3c the secret of the Creator's unity (in all His manifestations to man) in his heart's %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 506 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c desire (one's heart must be filled only with the sensation of the One, Upper %0a%3c Force). Afterward, the Mitzva to remember and remind others of the exodus %0a%3c from Egypt (egoism) is observed, as it is written: "Remember how you were a %0a%3c slave in Egypt." %0a%3c %0a%3c The fifth Mitzva is for a Cohen to bless the people (the Light's descent to the %0a%3c Partzuf), so that Israel will be included when the prayer (the Cohanim's blessing) %0a%3c ascends, for at this time (state), Knesset Israel (all those who correct themselves by %0a%3c aspiring to the Creator and constitute a part of Malchut de Atzilut), i.e., Malchut, %0a%3c receives a blessing (Light). %0a%3c %0a%3c The sixth Mitzva and the desired time (state, spiritual level when man wishes %0a%3c only to give all of his desires, i.e., his soul, to the Creator, meaning that he can %0a%3c act for the Creator's sake in all of his desires) is to entrust one's soul with the %0a%3c Creator with complete desire in one's heart. When one falls (willingly accepts %0a%3c the small state) on his face (Hochma) and proclaims (raises MAN): "I entrust my %0a%3c soul with You, O Creator." The intentions and desires of his heart are to give his %0a%3c soul completely to the Creator (this desire is the consequence of this spiritual %0a%3c degree and comes naturally to those who attain it). %0a%3c %0a%3c These six Mitzvot of the prayer correspond to the 600 Mitzvot of the Torah. %0a%3c And the remaining thirteen Mitzvot are required in order to attract the thirteen %0a%3c properties of mercy (thirteen Midot HaRachamim), which include all the rest. %0a%3c The prayer is adorned with 600 Mitzvot, which corresponds to HGT NHY, to %0a%3c what the prayer, Malchut, receives from ZA. %0a%3c %0a%3c Happy is he who heeded and focused his desire on this (who was able to %0a%3c raise a proper request for his correction), who completed all that was required %0a%3c each day (in the Creator's daylight), and directed his heart's intentions and %0a%3c desires to fulfill this Mitzva, which depends on the word. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The End %0a\ No newline at end of file%0a
