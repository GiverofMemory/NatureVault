In England the Imperial gallon of 277.274 cubic inches = 70,000 grains = 10 lb. av. is used. The minim of the former = 0.95 gr., of the latter= 0.91 gr. The former contains 16 fluidounces to the pint (O.), the latter 20. The following tables give the value of each in grains of pure water, at 60°.%0aFluid measures%0aTHE DECIMAL SYSTEM,%0a%0aAdopted in France and on the Continent, is used in this country in scientific research. The standard of length is the metre (1/10,000,000 of a quadrant of the earth's meridian), which is equal (as corrected by Prof. Bache) to 39.36850535 inches, or, roughly, about 3 1/4 feet. This, as well as the measures of capacity and weight, is increased or divided decimally. The prefixes are deca (10 times), hecto (100 times), kilo ( 1000 times), and myria (10,000 times); deci (1/10), centi (1/100), milli (1/1000). The kilometre is equal to about two-thirds of a mile.%0aThe cubic decimetre is the unit of capacity, and is called a litre, and is equal to 1.765 imperial pints, or 2.1135 wine pints (the latter are used in the United States). The weight of 1 litre of water at 39.10°, is called a kilogramme, and that of a millilitre of water a gramme = 15.434 grains. The kilogramme is rather less than 2 1/4 lbs. avoirdupois. The metrical pound of France is half a kilogramme. One fluidounce equals in capacity 29.53 cubic centimetres.%0a%0aComparative Table of Decimal with Avoirdupois and Apothecaries' (U. S.)

In order to compare these conveniently, pure water at 60° is taken as the standard. A cubic foot of water weighs 100 oz., hence to determine the weight of a given bulk of any body the specific gravity of which is known, multiply the cubic content in feet by 1000, and this by the s. g., and the product will be the weight in ounces avoirdupois. Thus, the s. g. of cast-iron is 7.207, that is, it is 7.207 times heavier than an equal bulk of water. A cylinder of cast-iron 1 foot in diameter and 10 feet high, would contain 10 cubic feet, 10 X 1000 X 7.207 = 72.070 oz. = 4500 lbs.%0aSpecific Gravity of Solids.%0a%0a1. By the Pitcher. - Fill a pitcher, or similar vessel, brim full; put in the body; it will displace its own bulk of water; catch this water as it overflows and weigh it. Divide the weight of the body by that of the water displaced, the quotient will be its specific gravity. A very neat instrument for performing this process accurately has been contrived by Messrs. Eckfeldt and Dubois, of the United States Mint.%0a2. By the Hydrostatic Balance. - Weigh the body, fasten it, preferably by a horse-hair, immerse it in water, and note the loss of weight. The weight in air divided by the loss of weight in water = the s. g.%0a%0a3. When the Body is Lighter than Water. - Attach to it some heavy body of known weight in air and water. Weigh the two together, first in air and then in water, note the loss. The loss of weight of the heavy body in water being known the difference between these losses divided into the weight of the light body in air, will give the specific gravity. Thus, a bit of wood weighed in air 200 grains, attached to a piece of copper the two weighed in air 2247 grains, and in water 1620 grains suffering a loss of 627 grains, the copper alone loses in water 230 grains, 627 - 230 = 397, the loss of the wood; 200/397 = 0.504, s. g. of the wood.%0a%0aWhen the Solid is Soluble in Water.%0a%0aTake its s. g. in regard to some liquid which does not dissolve it, multiply this by the s. g. of the liquid.%0aThus, a piece of sugar weighed in air 400 grs. it lost in oil of turpentine 217.5. 400/217.5 = 1.84. The s. g. of turpentine is .87; 1.84 X .87 = 1.6., s. g. of the sugar.%0a%0aWhen the Body is in Powder.%0a%0aIntroduce it into a counterpoise bottle, of which the capacity is known. Fill the bottle with pure water at 60°. It will hold as much less as is equal to the bulk of the powder, and the weight of the powder in air divided by this difference will give the s. g.%0aThus, the bottle holds 1000 grs. of water, 100 grs. of emery are introduced, and the bottle filled up with water. If no water were displaced the two should weigh 1100 grs., they really weigh 1070; the difference, 30 grs. = the weight of water displaced; 100/30 = 3.333, s. g of the emery.%0a%0aWhen the Solid is Compound.%0a%0aAs a nugget of gold and quartz. Take the s. g. of the nugget, that of gold and quartz being known, then apply the following formulae:%0aX weight of nugget%0as. g. nugget - s. g. quartz%0as. g. gold -s. g. quartz	X	s. g. gold%0as. g. nugget	%0a= weight of gold in nugget.%0aX weight of nugget%0as. g. gold - s. g. nugget%0as. g. gold -s. g. quartz	X	s. g. quartz%0as. g. nugget	%0a= weight of quartz in do.%0a%0aThis method will do approximately, but not accurately for alloys of metals generally.%0a%0aSPECIFIC GRAVITY OF LIQUIDS.%0a%0aBy the Balance.%0a%0aTake a bit of glass rod, note its loss when weighed in water and in the liquid under trial. Divide the latter by the former, the quotient will be the s. g. of the liquid. Thus a glass rod loses in water 171 grs., in alcohol, 143 grs. 143/171 = .836. s. g. of the alcohol.%0aSpecific Gravity bottles.%0a%0aThese are made to hold 100 or 1000 grs. of pure water at 60°, and are accompanied by a counterpoise. It is only necessary to fill the bottle with the liquid to be tested. Counterpoise and weigh; the weight in grains will be the s. g. Oily and viscous matter should never be introduced into the s. g. bottle. In case the s. g. bottle is not at hand any light flask will do. Make a file mark on the neck, counterpoise it, fill to the mark with pure water at 60, note the weight of the water. Empty, dry thoroughly and fill with the liquid to be tested; the weight of this divided by that of the water = s. g.%0aHydrometers%0a%0aAre instruments for determining the specific gravity of liquids by noting the depth to which a stem sinks. They consist of a cylinder with a weight beneath it to make it float upright, and a graduated stem. When intended for liquids lighter than water, the 0 or point at which they float in pure water at 60° is at the lower point of the stem, and as the liquid is lighter they sink more deeply; for liquids heavier than water the 0 is at the top of the scale. Many are graduated according to their proposed use, as alcoholometers, lactometers, sacharometers. (see DISTILLATION). The graduation most employed is that of Beaume. Excellent hydrometers with the degrees and the true s. g. on the same stem are made by Dr. W. H. Pile of Philadelphia.%0aTo Convert Degrees Beaume into Specific Gravity.%0a%0a1. For liquids heavier than water - Subtract the degree B. from 145, and divide into 145, the quotient is the s. g.%0a2. For liquids lighter than water - Add the degree B. to 130, and divide it into 140. The quotient is the s. g.%0a%0aTo Convert Specific Gravity into Degrees Beaume.%0a%0a1. For liquids heavier than water. - Divide the s. g. into 145, and subtract from 145. The remainder is the degree B.%0a2. For liquids lighter than water. - Divide the s. g. into 140 and subtract 130 from the quotient. The remainder will be the degree B.%0a%0aTable of Specific Gravity.%0a%0aMercury	13,600%0aLead	11,325%0aCopper	9,000%0aCast Brass	8,000%0aSteel	7,850%0aWrought Iron	7,780%0aCast Iron	7,207%0aTin	7,300%0aMarble	2,690%0aCommon Stone	2,520%0aBrick	2,000%0aSoil	1,974%0aCoal, anthracite	1,640%0aCoal, bituminous	1,270%0aSand	1,620%0aSea-water	1,030%0aCOMMON WATER	1,000%0aOak, (dry)	925%0aAsh	800%0aMaple	755%0aElm	600%0aYellow Pine	660%0aWhite Pine	554%0aCork	249%0aCarb.

It is very steady, does not change its form under any pressure. It is, therefore, used in street lamps. It is not, however, economical.%0a%0aFish-tail. - This form is generally used in houses; it has two openings in the top, from which the jets of gas issue and form a flat flame, the plane of which is at right angles to that of the openings. When the pressure is too great the flame elongates and sings, thus calling attention to the waste. It is an economical burner, but flickers. This unsteadiness is trying to the eyes, and the fish-tail should never be used to read or write by.%0a%0aArgand. - These are the steadiest and most economical burners, but require a chimney. The gas is allowed to escape by a ring of holes, and the air is admitted both inside and outside of this ring. In the patent Argand the outer ring of air passes through a series of small openings, and the inner ring is deflected into the flame by a button; It requires a swelled chimney. By cutting off the button a steadier light is obtained, and the economy is nearly the same; straight chimneys are more easily obtained than the others. The best flint-glass chimneys are in the end the cheapest; great loss of light ensues if they are not kept clean. But putting a chimney into hydrant-water, and gradually heating it, it may be cleaned safely; paper gives the best finish. The larger the burner the greater the relative economy.%0a%0aRelative Light for Unit of Gas.%0a%0aBatswing	consuming 5 feet,	1.000%0aLarge patent Argand burner	consuming 6 feet,	2.880%0aCommon Argand	consuming 5.4 feet,	2.132%0aSingle jet	consuming 2.2 feet,	1.191%0aFish-tail (Union jet)	consuming 4.5 feet,	1.513%0aLarge Batswing	consuming 11.3 feet,	2.03%0aWax candle, 4 to lb.		0.143%0aSperm candle, 6 to lb.		0.111%0aTallow candle, 5 to lb.		0.1%0a%0aPhotometry.%0a%0a1 wax candle,	4 to a lb.	burns 13 hours.%0a1 spermaceti candle,	6 to a lb.	burns 8 hours.%0a1 Tallow candle,	6 to a lb.	burns 6 hours.%0a%0aA STATEMENT OF FOREIGN GOLD AND SILVER COINS, FROM THE ANNUAL REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR OF THE MINT.%0aExplanatory Remarks.%0a%0a%0aThe first column embraces the names of the countries where the coins are issued, the second contains the names of the coin, only the principal denominations being given.

It is the official standard of the U. S. Pharmacopoeia. The British Pharmacopoeia uses the avoirdupois pound and ounce; hence the two agree only in the grain measure. The denominations of apothecaries' weight are the pound, lb, = 12 ounces = 5,760 grains; the ounce, oj, = 8 drachms = 480 grains; the drachm, dj, = 3 scruples = 60 grains; the scruple, sj, = 20 grains; and the grain, gr.%0a%3c %0a%3c Avoirdupois Weight is the commercial weight, and is generally employed in the receipts in this volume. Its pound, lb., = 16 ounces, oz., = 7,000 grains. The ounce contains 437.5 grains. The apothecaries' or troy ounce contains 42 1/2 grains more than the avoirdupois ounce, and the apothecaries or troy pound contains 1.240 grains less than the commercial or avoirdupois pound.

In England the Imperial gallon of 277.274 cubic inches = 70,000 grains = 10 lb. av. is used. The minim of the former = 0.95 gr., of the latter= 0.91 gr. The former contains 16 fluidounces to the pint (O.), the latter 20. The following tables give the value of each in grains of pure water, at 60°.%0a%3c Fluid measures%0a%3c THE DECIMAL SYSTEM,%0a%3c %0a%3c Adopted in France and on the Continent, is used in this country in scientific research. The standard of length is the metre (1/10,000,000 of a quadrant of the earth's meridian), which is equal (as corrected by Prof. Bache) to 39.36850535 inches, or, roughly, about 3 1/4 feet. This, as well as the measures of capacity and weight, is increased or divided decimally. The prefixes are deca (10 times), hecto (100 times), kilo ( 1000 times), and myria (10,000 times); deci (1/10), centi (1/100), milli (1/1000). The kilometre is equal to about two-thirds of a mile.%0a%3c The cubic decimetre is the unit of capacity, and is called a litre, and is equal to 1.765 imperial pints, or 2.1135 wine pints (the latter are used in the United States). The weight of 1 litre of water at 39.10°, is called a kilogramme, and that of a millilitre of water a gramme = 15.434 grains. The kilogramme is rather less than 2 1/4 lbs. avoirdupois. The metrical pound of France is half a kilogramme. One fluidounce equals in capacity 29.53 cubic centimetres.%0a%3c %0a%3c Comparative Table of Decimal with Avoirdupois and Apothecaries' (U. S.)

In order to compare these conveniently, pure water at 60° is taken as the standard. A cubic foot of water weighs 100 oz., hence to determine the weight of a given bulk of any body the specific gravity of which is known, multiply the cubic content in feet by 1000, and this by the s. g., and the product will be the weight in ounces avoirdupois. Thus, the s. g. of cast-iron is 7.207, that is, it is 7.207 times heavier than an equal bulk of water. A cylinder of cast-iron 1 foot in diameter and 10 feet high, would contain 10 cubic feet, 10 X 1000 X 7.207 = 72.070 oz. = 4500 lbs.%0a%3c Specific Gravity of Solids.%0a%3c %0a%3c 1. By the Pitcher. - Fill a pitcher, or similar vessel, brim full; put in the body; it will displace its own bulk of water; catch this water as it overflows and weigh it. Divide the weight of the body by that of the water displaced, the quotient will be its specific gravity. A very neat instrument for performing this process accurately has been contrived by Messrs. Eckfeldt and Dubois, of the United States Mint.%0a%3c 2. By the Hydrostatic Balance. - Weigh the body, fasten it, preferably by a horse-hair, immerse it in water, and note the loss of weight. The weight in air divided by the loss of weight in water = the s. g.%0a%3c %0a%3c 3. When the Body is Lighter than Water. - Attach to it some heavy body of known weight in air and water. Weigh the two together, first in air and then in water, note the loss. The loss of weight of the heavy body in water being known the difference between these losses divided into the weight of the light body in air, will give the specific gravity. Thus, a bit of wood weighed in air 200 grains, attached to a piece of copper the two weighed in air 2247 grains, and in water 1620 grains suffering a loss of 627 grains, the copper alone loses in water 230 grains, 627 - 230 = 397, the loss of the wood; 200/397 = 0.504, s. g. of the wood.%0a%3c %0a%3c When the Solid is Soluble in Water.%0a%3c %0a%3c Take its s. g. in regard to some liquid which does not dissolve it, multiply this by the s. g. of the liquid.%0a%3c Thus, a piece of sugar weighed in air 400 grs. it lost in oil of turpentine 217.5. 400/217.5 = 1.84. The s. g. of turpentine is .87; 1.84 X .87 = 1.6., s. g. of the sugar.%0a%3c %0a%3c When the Body is in Powder.%0a%3c %0a%3c Introduce it into a counterpoise bottle, of which the capacity is known. Fill the bottle with pure water at 60°. It will hold as much less as is equal to the bulk of the powder, and the weight of the powder in air divided by this difference will give the s. g.%0a%3c Thus, the bottle holds 1000 grs. of water, 100 grs. of emery are introduced, and the bottle filled up with water. If no water were displaced the two should weigh 1100 grs., they really weigh 1070; the difference, 30 grs. = the weight of water displaced; 100/30 = 3.333, s. g of the emery.%0a%3c %0a%3c When the Solid is Compound.%0a%3c %0a%3c As a nugget of gold and quartz. Take the s. g. of the nugget, that of gold and quartz being known, then apply the following formulae:%0a%3c X weight of nugget%0a%3c s. g. nugget - s. g. quartz%0a%3c s. g. gold -s. g. quartz	X	s. g. gold%0a%3c s. g. nugget	%0a%3c = weight of gold in nugget.%0a%3c X weight of nugget%0a%3c s. g. gold - s. g. nugget%0a%3c s. g. gold -s. g. quartz	X	s. g. quartz%0a%3c s. g. nugget	%0a%3c = weight of quartz in do.%0a%3c %0a%3c This method will do approximately, but not accurately for alloys of metals generally.%0a%3c %0a%3c SPECIFIC GRAVITY OF LIQUIDS.%0a%3c %0a%3c By the Balance.%0a%3c %0a%3c Take a bit of glass rod, note its loss when weighed in water and in the liquid under trial. Divide the latter by the former, the quotient will be the s. g. of the liquid. Thus a glass rod loses in water 171 grs., in alcohol, 143 grs. 143/171 = .836. s. g. of the alcohol.%0a%3c Specific Gravity bottles.%0a%3c %0a%3c These are made to hold 100 or 1000 grs. of pure water at 60°, and are accompanied by a counterpoise. It is only necessary to fill the bottle with the liquid to be tested. Counterpoise and weigh; the weight in grains will be the s. g. Oily and viscous matter should never be introduced into the s. g. bottle. In case the s. g. bottle is not at hand any light flask will do. Make a file mark on the neck, counterpoise it, fill to the mark with pure water at 60, note the weight of the water. Empty, dry thoroughly and fill with the liquid to be tested; the weight of this divided by that of the water = s. g.%0a%3c Hydrometers%0a%3c %0a%3c Are instruments for determining the specific gravity of liquids by noting the depth to which a stem sinks. They consist of a cylinder with a weight beneath it to make it float upright, and a graduated stem. When intended for liquids lighter than water, the 0 or point at which they float in pure water at 60° is at the lower point of the stem, and as the liquid is lighter they sink more deeply; for liquids heavier than water the 0 is at the top of the scale. Many are graduated according to their proposed use, as alcoholometers, lactometers, sacharometers. (see DISTILLATION). The graduation most employed is that of Beaume. Excellent hydrometers with the degrees and the true s. g. on the same stem are made by Dr. W. H. Pile of Philadelphia.%0a%3c To Convert Degrees Beaume into Specific Gravity.%0a%3c %0a%3c 1. For liquids heavier than water - Subtract the degree B. from 145, and divide into 145, the quotient is the s. g.%0a%3c 2.

It is very steady, does not change its form under any pressure. It is, therefore, used in street lamps. It is not, however, economical.%0a%3c %0a%3c Fish-tail. - This form is generally used in houses; it has two openings in the top, from which the jets of gas issue and form a flat flame, the plane of which is at right angles to that of the openings. When the pressure is too great the flame elongates and sings, thus calling attention to the waste. It is an economical burner, but flickers. This unsteadiness is trying to the eyes, and the fish-tail should never be used to read or write by.%0a%3c %0a%3c Argand. - These are the steadiest and most economical burners, but require a chimney. The gas is allowed to escape by a ring of holes, and the air is admitted both inside and outside of this ring. In the patent Argand the outer ring of air passes through a series of small openings, and the inner ring is deflected into the flame by a button; It requires a swelled chimney. By cutting off the button a steadier light is obtained, and the economy is nearly the same; straight chimneys are more easily obtained than the others. The best flint-glass chimneys are in the end the cheapest; great loss of light ensues if they are not kept clean. But putting a chimney into hydrant-water, and gradually heating it, it may be cleaned safely; paper gives the best finish.
