csum=You will be naked (including no skillbook) until you loot your corpse, but you may ask others to use skills for you like summon temporary items for you or give you food or drink.  Good samaritan players may hang out at bind points helping those that wake up dead. Perhaps a high level Water skill (that has ~20 required of each of the 4 relevant stats) can be "heavenly garb" which clones your original gear temporarily from your corpse.  A high level Air spell of the same caliber can be "angelic wings" which allows a recently dead character to float above the aggro zone of every monster for a limited time.  A high level Earth spell of the same caliber could be "total recall" where a recently dead group member player is instantly transported to the caster via gravity tunnel that opens in the earth, or total recall can instead be you gain a temporary clone of your skillbook for use on your journey.  A high level Fire spell of the same caliber could be "fumes of Ichor" where monsters cannot see you for a limited time unless you are standing right on top of them (but you have to be naked), and if they do swing at you they are more likely to miss.

Also less design inspiration and more specifics inspiration from MTG, Diablo 2, Might and Magic 6, Lord of the Rings, Chronicles of Narnia, Dune, fifth element, and Minecraft (things like spells, items, locations, characters, etc).  New World and WoW dragonflight were also probably inspirations of the starting voyage.%0a%0a!!Marketing%0a%0aPlay a game that requires a group of synergistic classes to succeed against a world in turmoil.

Of course bieng more powerful will help the group as well, but a tiny bit less directly.%0a%0a#Charmed monsters can be directed (moved) by the user (or others by Ni skill) but formulated monsters cannot be moved by their creator since they lack Ni.  Charmed monsters must be charmed in battle and only last as long as that battle (at most).  Formulated (summoned or constructed) monsters act of their own accord but can be inspired by the creator or others (using Ne skills) of what they should be doing. Formulated creatures can be directed (moved) by Ni users, but the formulator doesn't have Ni themself. Formulated monsters last for an extended period.  Ne skills can inspire summoned or charmed monsters to do things like defend, attack, guard, follow, and so on.%0a%0a%0a!!!!Notes%0a%0aGlamour causes illusions [[https://occult-world.com/glamour/|#]]%0a%0a!!Character creation%0a%0aSelect specie and class%0a%0aRoll 3d6 7 times and choose the top 4 3d6 rolls and assign to the 4 personality traits of your class however you decide.  Discard lowest 3 of the 3d6 rolls.  This is done so that someone buying multiple NFT's to reroll won't have a significant advantage as someone who only has one NFT.  Also this method allows you to pick your class which old school D&D pretty much didn't let you do.%0a%0aYou will gain 1 stat (personality) point per level.  So if you had all perfect character creation rolls, you would have max stats at level 8.  There are 20 levels (actually 25 but each one after 20 is exponentially harder to hit, so no one will ever have totally maxed stats).  Level 8 dueling will be a thing!%0a%0aIf you rolled all average character creation rolls (10's) then you would be able to max 2 traits by level 20.%0a%0aIf you want to reroll, you need a new NFT.  Only one character per NFT, this is so you have to stick with your rolls, you can't just keep rolling until you get perfect rolls.  Since everything is built from the NFT, when you trade the NFT you trade your character.  Different versions (block explorer gui's) may allow or not allow trading of the NFTs (characters).%0a%0aNFT required to make 1 character will take a decent desktop 1 month to complete%0a%0aFinal group skills, 20, 20, 20, 20%0aFinal personal skills 22, 22, 18, 18%0a%0aLevel 19 will give 2 personals and 1 group (choose 2)%0aLevel 20 will give 2 groups and 1 personal (choose 2)%0a%0a!!!Specie%0a%0aSpecie choice determines special abilities and might synergize with certain classes.

Good raids would be fighting psyonics and evil would be fighting creatures.%0a%0aAnd of course there will be raids and events where good and evil can attend and contest content.%0a%0aThis is done so that players with an evil bent and players with a good bent won't be contesting the same content to keep disputes to a minimum.%0a%0aThere will be some open alignment raids as well, but not all would be.  Having closed alignment content is a good alternative to instancing and will have improved results because it is basically instancing based on personality traits.%0a!!!Tutorial%0a%0aThe tutorial is the boat ride to the new continent.  The shipmaster requires that for the dangerous journey you must have 8-12 players, and all 8 different classes, and everyone at least level 2, in order to board the ship.  In this ride, group play will happen perhaps with fighting ghosts or pirates or sea monsters.  It will be an informal tutorial with the shipmaster explaining things and having you do things, this will include adding eachother to your friends list.%0a%0aTutorial tasks will begin with a task for each class based on their dominant function.  After that there will be a task for each class based on their secondary function.  Then a battle that will use skills from dominant and secondary functions, and then throw in a surprise that disturbs the order on the ship and requires each player to use their tertiary function briefly.%0a%0aNi: go up to the birds nest above the fog and call out directions to the captain.%0a%0aSi:%0a%0aNe:%0a%0aSe:%0a%0aTi:%0a%0aTe:%0a%0aFi:%0a%0aFe:%0a%0aAs an mmo lover who has started alone, I am not going to allow that feeling of desolation happen (however places of solitude is nice).  The best way to improve retention in a hard game is giving players an inspiring goal, and getting players in a community.%0a%0a4 starting areas, one for each guild. You can travel between these freely on a rowboat if you need to group up with friends to begin journey to the new land. Rowboats require 2-4 players in order to make the journey to another guild and along the voyage you will face random encounters. The dockmaster won't let you go alone in his row boat because he knows you will get stranded.%0a%0aEarth guild: Parie (grean meadows like shire with sheep with underground cities)%0a%0aFire guild: Savage lands (volcanic isles like mordor or lavastorm or estate of unrest or dagnors cauldron)%0a%0aAir guild: Cape York (redwood tree city and amber waves of grain and purple mountains)%0a%0aWater guild: Rio del Marr (sandy duney oasis with ancient ruins and underwater cities like atlantis)%0a!!!Notes%0a%0aThis is designed so that players of basically any level can play together, max level players aren't radically stronger than level 1.  Leveling up should be more about perfecting your character and gaining new abilities instead of becoming exponentially stronger.  As an mmo player who couldn't play with his friend because his parents let him play a couple months before mine allowed me to, I will not let that ever be a problem again.  The power of 1999 everquest was I did make new friends, but it was close to me giving up when we realized we could never play together.%0a%0aMonsters will be designed to be relatively equal to a players strength at a given level similar to everquest.  So you may be able to solo in a dungeon of your same level, if you are lucky... but you will likely need a group to do anything harder or to be safe from dying.%0a%0aLevel 20 is a softcap (no monsters or dungeons higher than lvl 20) and a hardcap at 25.%0a%0aWhen you get all your stats to 18, then the stat cap becomes 25.  No skills will require more than 22 in 2 different stats and a lvl 20 character or lvl 20 in all 4 stats and a lvl 20 character.  So at endgame everyone will have an opportunity to be pro, regardless of character creation rolls (barring extremly uncommon bad rolls).  Remember that you don't necessarily want to have just enough stats to use the most skills, but also skill power is based on stats so going all the way to the cap for certain stats may make sense for you.%0a%0aThe reason I combined introvert and extravert in the same class is mainly because they have all the same cognitive functions in relatively similar order.  So you can easily choose your stat rolls at creation and allocations throughthe levels to make either type in the same class.  Also some people tend to be more introverted in real life and extraverted online or vice versa.  I think the reason for this is that games are inherently an escape, so you tend to rather use your secondary function in games as a form of release from real life where you always lead with your primary.  Since a game doesn't really matter in real life, you tend to fall back on your secondary and more relaxing and impulsive function because stress doesn't force you into your primary.  This is mainly for casuals.  Once you become a hardcore gamer, you tend to use your real life personality because the stakes are higher and you feel like you must take the game seriously.  The classes in this game work perfectly for both casuals and hardcore players, and can adapt over time via your point allocation as you level.  Both hardcore and casual players of the same personality type are the same class, but will allocate stat points likely differently.%0a%0aThe reason the Guilds are chosen as they are is because the two classes in each have the same cognitive functions, just in different order so the skills are the same.  So in the earth guild for example each personality type (Druid and Shaman) will probably have an opportunity to learn any of the skills in that guild at some point if they want.%0a%0aThere are no (significant or planned) expansions, no level increases, no new zones (unless it is basically required for the story, and very few if any ever).  I'm not holding back anything from launch!  All the best ideas will be there at launch and won't change.  There will be monthly? GM events however which will keep things fresh and exciting.  Think of them like gamercon's.%0a%0aBoromir was either an estj or entj both have introverted feeling as their inferior [[ https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/characters/stats/LOTR/3/|#]], which is why he thought he should keep it but was wrong.%0a%0aMusical and songwriting abilities of the personalities [[https://www.personalityhacker.com/8-insights-from-profiling-hundreds-of-musicians/|#]]%0a%0aThere is going to be a backstory for each class, for you and how you are approaching the collapse and your vision or plan and where you fit in.  The narrator explaining the backstory will also reference each class and how they can work together.%0a%0a!!Guild and Skills%0a%0aEvery important action you take in-game will be using a skill.  There is no auto-attack.  This is done so that balancing the classes is possible and also the gameplay feel is relatively consistent between different classes.  However different classes will have vastly different roles both in and out of combat.%0a%0aYour guild cannot be chosen but is specific to your class type.  Although you can visit other guilds and may be able to use some of their skills.%0a%0aEach guild has two focuses, for example in the Earth guild there is the Metaphysics focus (Shaman's primary and Druids secondary) and the Creation focus (Druid's primary and Shaman's secondary)%0a%0aSome skills have a requisite number of points in only one stat in order to use it, some have requisite stat level in both relevant stats.  Some endgame skills will even require requisite stat levels of all 4 stats. Skills also have a level requirement, so that people with perfect rolls don't get endgame skills as a level 9.%0a%0aFor example the powerful Creation skills will require high Favor and Talent.  Lower level skills might just require Favor, or instead perhaps Talent.  Extraverted (group oriented) skills will require more Favor (Fe) than Talent (Si).  And for introverted (individual oriented) skills, the opposite.%0a%0aYou are given 2 skills when you start the game (after visiting your guild).  You can then only scribe 2 skills in your skill book per level (out of 3 choices per level in each guild focus), and they are permanent so be wise with your choices. If you make a mistake you will need to burn your skill book and formulate or buy a new empty skill book.  You will then need to somehow re-aquire all the skills you want.  At level 20 you can have up to 40 skills, and at level 25 (hard cap) -> 50 skills. You can scribe skills that you cannot yet use as long as you meet the level requirement, but to memorize (be able to use) it you will need the requisite stat points.%0a%0aYour skill book will only have one skill per page, so you will need to craft/buy/earn/summon enough pages for your book for all your skills.  Each page will give a full and illustrated description of the skill after it is scribed.  You will be able to be given a basic description of the skill (perhaps a demonstration by the guild master) before buying it. Your skill book will have an index for you to easily jump to a skill you want to learn more about or memorize.  Your skill book must be open to the correct page to memorize it, and it will take several seconds to a minute to memorize.%0a%0aSkill power scales with the relevant statistic(s) so each skill will be relatively unique, they aren't just upgraded versions of previous skills. 480 unique skills will be in the game, wow!  %0a%0aYou can only memorize (use in the same battle) a total of 1 skill per level until level 10.  So at level 1 you can memorize 2 skills, at level 2 you can memorize 2 skills, level 3 3 skills, level 4 you can memorize 4 skills, and so on up to 10.  Then at lvl 15 you can memorize 12 skills, lvl 20 -> 14 skills, and lvl 25 -> 15 skills.%0a%0a!!!!Guild notes%0a%0aEach guild has two classes that are mirror images of eachother [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9QG4-cpbUk|#]].  They have all the same cognitive functions but in opposite spots.  So my belief is that the two classes can learn from eachother on how to grow in use of thier inferior functions responsibly.%0a%0a!!!Earth%0a%0a!!!!Creation - Building the Cosmos%0a%0a*Favor%0a%0a*Talent%0a%0a!!!!Metaphysics - Designing Nature%0a%0a*Perception%0a%0a*Logic%0a%0a!!!Water%0a%0a!!!!Spirit - Directing the Heavens%0a%0a*Favor%0a%0a*Tactics%0a%0a!!!!Alchemy - Captivating the Imagination%0a%0a*Glamour%0a%0a*Logic%0a%0a!!!Air%0a%0a!!!!Light - Preserving the Possibile%0a%0a*Perception%0a%0a*Devotion%0a%0a!!!!Aether - Forming the Void%0a%0a!!!!!Talent%0a%0a!!!!!Cognizance%0a%0a*Flights of mind - allows you to rise up vertically from your body and gain a higher vantage point, but with inverted colors, so you can help your group navigate.%0a%0a!!!Fire%0a%0a!!!!Dark - Keepers of the Precious%0a%0a*Glamour%0a%0a*Devotion%0a%0a!!!!Prescience - Fulfilling the Prophecy%0a%0a!!!!!Tactics%0a%0a!!!!!Cognizance%0a%0a*Seer stones - allows an "eye of sauron" like effect where you can gain different perspectives on the zone in a sepia like tone to help you navigate.

And then divide that by the monster level.  %0a%0aThis is then divided by the number of players in the group.  If the number of players in the group is greater than 1, the number of players in the group can be multiplied by a number between 0 and 1 (perhaps 0.7) to make it so grouping is incentivized and not punished.  Perhaps this modifier can be improved (made smaller) the more members in the group that there are to incentivize large groups. This multiplicative factor is the group xp modifier (gxpm).  For 0.7 gxpm that would figure into a 30%25 group xp bonus.%0a%0a[@ xpm = ((Monster level - |Your level - monster level|) / monster level) / # players in group @]%0a%0aOr%0a%0a[@ xpm = ((Monster level - |Your level - monster level|) / monster level) / (# players in group * gxpm) @]%0a%0aYou then take this multipler (xpm) and multiply it by the xp of the monster (which is rolled by the blockhash of the killing blow to the monster).  The lowest xp modifier from everyone in the group is what each player in the group has to use to calculate their xp.  Each player will get slightly different xp because their xp roll will be the blockhash concatenated with their NFT to calculate their exact xp gain from the monster. %0a%0aThe reason we use the lowest xpm in the group for everyone is to prevent power leveling where a level 5 groups with a level 10 to kill level 5 monsters, making what the level 5 player learned from the fight trivial.  What this also accomplishes is that everyone in the group will level at roughly the same speed together, regardless of what their levels are.  So yes level 1 can play with their level 10 friend and they can both benefit.  They would optimize their xp by fighting monsters halfway between their respective levels, erring to the side of a little higher than halfway.  If anyone in the group is double the monster level or more, no one in the group gets any xp based on the equation. If the xpm comes out negative, then they get zero xp for the encounter.%0a%0aMonsters of the same difficulty class (regardless of level) award the same amount of xp points.  The amount of xp you need to level up is the same for every level until 20.  After 20, each level takes 10%25 more xp to level up than the previous level.  Also there are no monsters beyond level 20 (except possibly bosses) so at level 25 fighting level 20 monsters you will be gaining (20-5)/20 = 75%25 of the xp dropped by the monster and level will take you 100%25*1.1*1.1*1.1*1.1*1.1 = 161%25 of the standard level worth of xp. 161%25 / 0.75 = 214.7%25 which means that gaining level 25 would take over twice the time as gaining level 20.%0a%0aYou will get the most experience for fighting monsters of your own level but you still can play with others above or below you in level, just a bit less optimally.  This makes sense that from a monster lower level than you, you would learn less than when you were their same level.  But it also can make sense that fighting a monster higher level than you (remember that an average monster of your same level will be as strong as you are), you probably only won because either you got lucky, you were carried by your group, or you were twinked - in which case it makes sense you would learn less.  This is different than any current game I know of and is done to help prevent twinking and power leveling.%0a%0a!!!Amount of xp per monster%0a%0aTypically each round (where every player and every monster gets to act once) will last about 6 seconds for an average fight.  Each encounter should last about 10 rounds or about 1 minute for an average monster.  So we can assume each player will get 1 monster worth of xp every minute of non stop play.%0a%0aWe want the player to level in an average play session (which is how D&D was designed roughly) of 3 hours.  This means that it will take about 60 * 3 = 180 monsters.  So each (average monster class) monster will give 1/180th of a level.  Of course you won't be killing monsters constantly, and the more people you are playing with typically the less efficient you will be since there will be discussions, but with a group xp modifier this can help out and shorten the time a large group can level up.%0a%0a!!!Leveling%0a%0aOnce you reach required xp, you must journey back to your guild to level up via the guild master, and to acquire new skills to scribe and memorize.%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a!!Death penalty%0a%0aThere can be bind skills and bind locations so you have to travel back to your corpse.%0a%0aYou will be naked (including no skillbook) until you loot your corpse, but you may ask others to use skills for you like summon temporary items for you or give you food or drink.  Good samaritan players may hang out at bind points helping those that wake up dead. Perhaps a high level Water skill (that has ~20 required of each of the 4 relevant stats) can be "heavenly garb" which clones your original gear temporarily from your corpse.  A high level Air spell of the same caliber can be "angelic wings" which allows a recently dead character to float above the aggro zone of every monster for a limited time.  A high level Earth spell of the same caliber could be "total recall" where a recently dead group member player is instantly transported to the caster via gravity tunnel that opens in the earth, or total recall can instead be you gain a temporary clone of your skillbook for use on your journey.  A high level Fire spell of the same caliber could be "fumes of Ichor" where monsters cannot see you for a limited time unless you are standing right on top of them (but you have to be naked), and if they do swing at you they are more likely to miss.%0a%0aThere may be slight experience loss (like amnesia), say ~3 monsters of your level.  This experience loss can be reversed partially by certain spells (up to 75%25) like everquest {I've regained my memory!} or by retrieving your corpse (50%25) {ah yes I am remembering now}.%0a%0aWhen you get knocked out by a monster you loose all aggro and an average monster will not typically finish you off unless you had a DoT on you or a monster was in the middle of casting a nuke when you got knocked down or you get hit with an AoE directed at another player. In the knocked out state you can be healed by certain spells, so that when you can get back up you can have full health.  Any tiny hit you recieve with knockdown effect on (lasts 10 minutes) will kill you.  Wait till the fight is over to get up.  In the knocked out state you can choose to bleed out and die so you can go back to your bind point and run back to loot your corpse and keep playing without downtime.  The 10 min knockdown effect begins immediately when you are knocked down, so you have to just lie there on the ground until it is over then get up at your own leisure (or just bleed out if you don't want to wait).  This is the perfect time for a snack/bathroom break. If you are knocked down (and don't choose to bleed out, or are not killed) you loose only ~1 monster of xp from short term memory loss.%0a%0a!!Perspective%0a%0a1st person perspective.  There would be ways to see your character in other views but not any that are more viable playing than first person.  These other views should be at an awkward angle like looking back at your character from directly in front where the character blocks your view, or looking straight down on them from about 10 feet up (no 100 ft birds eye view), or from right behind the character but the character blocks your view.  Also these should auto-revert back to first person after about 10 seconds, or it requires you to hold a button that is important to use for other things.  Also I like how opening up the inventory window shows you your character in real time, as you put on and remove equipment, like you are looking in a mirror. %0a%0aThis way everyone is playing the game in first person, but you can take a look at your character often if you want.  There will be no "over the shoulder" or isometric 3rd person or birds eye view that would distract from the immersion of **bieng** your character.  Also I want monsters to be able to sneak up on the character and surprise them if they aren't constantly looking around.  And looking around doesn't mean "go into 100ft birds eye view to make sure there is nothing around you" it would mean actually turning around and looking around you.%0a%0a"First person only" would also translate well into VR.%0a%0a%0a!!World%0a%0aI want to use an open world design primarily.  I want the feeling I got in everquest which was high level mobs wrecking noobs and then the noobs get to see high level players coming in and saving them and taking the mob.  I also got this feeling in Celtic Heroes.%0a%0aBut also I love the "maps" feature from path of exile where for a cost to the player you can open up temporary portals to new but short, preferably shared, experiences.  This can be great for a scheduled play time with friends that you know you won't have to be wasting all your time camping a randomly spawning moband then have to contest it against rivals.  While that experience I just described can be supremely rewarding, itisn't practical for many players.  Having both of these while forcing the player to spend most of their time in the open world, I think is best.%0a%0aThe benefit here between this dichotomy is that low and high players will most of the time be in the same areas.  But high players can spend some time away doing exclusive things, but they can't stay there forever.%0a%0aAnother benefit is that we can keep the open world content static.  There isnothing worse than taking a break from a game and returning and all the iconicand nostalgic places are now empty, or even worse, significantly different.  With the portal function (instances) we can make those portals different and constantly changing to keep things fresh and exciting, while never loosing the open world nostalgia and consistancy.%0a%0a!!Travel%0a%0aThere is nothing like the new player experience in Everquest where your buddy who was a human warriorplaying in Freeport tells youto make a cleric which starts halfway across the world in Qeynos and tells you to come to him.  He tells you to gaina  few levels in the starter zone, get some food and drink, buy a lantern, and follow the trails to get to him.  Or going to Unrest throuh perilous terrain and waiting for boats with others at the docks.  I remember as a 13 year old playing everquest with only 3 hour play windows after homework, that sometimes I would be content ifI was just able to travel to a target destination in those 3 hours and it was fun and adventurous and I met new people and experienced difficulties.  One time at the end of my 3 hours I fell off the boat at a zone line and drowned.  The whole next day of school was filled with anxiety as to whether I would ever be able to get my corpse back.  Or another time when I died with a group of people and had to log off, and nowthe wholenext day was anxiety that they were all able to help eachother recover their corpses but now I willbe on my own to get mine.  Also there was this fear that if you took too long to recover your corpse that it would be lost forever and despawn. I want to discover what it was about travel in everquest that made it so compelling.%0a%0a%0a!!Enemies%0a%0a!!!Drops%0a%0aEvery drop will be useful for formulation or synthesis, there is no "vendor trash".%0a%0a!!!Locations%0a%0aThe highest level monsters (above 20) will be found in noob zones giving new players a sense of danger and adventure.%0a%0a!!Time%0a%0aTick = 6 seconds.  A batch of player and monster actions can happen every tick, or one action by one character every tick.%0a%0aTurn = In the case that one action by one character happens every 6 seconds, a full one turn from every player and non player character should last about a minute.  Otherwise a turn can just be 6 seconds for fast paced play.  In this fast paced case, players can queue up actions before the next tick.%0a%0a!!Botting prevention%0a%0aLike has been partially discussed in [[NatureVault.ProofOfPlay]], your character is tied to an NFT so you can't just make infinite characters without cost.  The NFT's are like keys to the game so they should cost a lot in either money or effort or time or work to aquire and the NFT creator is responsible to make their best effort to only give one per person or just be consistent with whatever amount per person they allow. Pseudonym pairs either online [[https://www.docdroid.net/file/download/3OkttUN/online-pseudonym-parties-a-foundation-for-proof-of-personhood-in-the-web-30-jurisdiction-pdf.pdf|#]] or offline is the most responsible way to do this, or something like proof of work [[CollectBit]] [[mineable nft]] would work but something like "Governmental Identity Verification" or "KYC" should never be used as it breaks the whole point of decentralized blockchain.%0a%0aIn terms of can someone then bot that character while they are sleeping for example, it would be possible.  One way to counter this would be AI bot recognition blockchain analysis software.  It isn't that these NFT's would be banned if discovered as a bot, you can't remove something valid on the blockchain. But they could be labeled as potential automated accounts (or this account has been traded X# of times) in competing block explorer gui's (a lot like competing browsers, some browsers mark "potentially harmful websites") and items gained by these accounts could also be labeled in gui's, so those who want to play on legit gui's could avoid them.  Also you would be able to see statistics using block explorer GUI for accounts play time and time of day and average play time per day etc to see if they trust this account.%0a%0aThis does seem a lot like "social credit score" and it would be if this were tied to someones real life identity.  NFT's in the case of [[NatureVault.ProofOfPlay]] are pseudononymous uncensorable crypto like bitcoin and thus are the responsible way to use this technology as opposed to web3 which seeks to tie your real government identity to the web.  Identities are disposable on true blockchain as you can always stop using one NFT and get another to use.  If the NFT creator won't issue you another one (they should if using some type of pseudononymous pair as new identities can be gained ever certain amount of days) you can find another NFT creator's game and use that.  This blockchain will support nearly infinite cross-compatible games running simultaneously.  Anyone can create a set of NFT's to distribute for their own flavor or mod of the game.%0a%0aNot making items add exponential levels of power to your players will also help improve this problem, making there be less RMT pressure to keep up or "git gud".  This will lead to fewer bots thinking it is worth their time.  Also not making the game last forever and higher levels providing diminishing returns instead of exponential returns in player power, will help tremendously.%0a%0a!!!Cross-compatibility%0a%0aThe best way to do cross compatibility is a one time fork of the character, and after that items gained in each fork cannot be moved over to another fork.  The portal would be a good visual cue of this.%0a%0a!!Endgame%0a%0a//"The journey **is** the destination"//%0a%0aThere will be level 20 raids and perhaps something higher than that.  There will also be (hopefully) monthly GM events to participate or even help out in.%0a%0aBesides that, what you do when you feel your character is completed is up to you.  Duel. Wow some noobs.  Help people. Make a new character.  Help out with or participate in GM events.  The options are endless.%0a%0aAlso there will probably be cross-compatible games with a higher level cap that you can go through a portal to and fork your character, to continue your journey there.%0a%0a!!Music%0a%0aMusic is critical.  Should be a soundtrack of open source music likely trance,synthwave,Alt rock/post-hardcore/punk%0a%0a!!Backstory%0a%0aNarrated by someone you don't know the fate of; before the collapse happens and how he envisions the future needs to rebuild and reunite. Like the Giver of memory from "the giver". To you it becomes the prophecy that you and your group are trying to fulfill.%0a%0aThe collapse just happened and the survivors remember everythign about society but are powerless to just rebuild it.  The fall has been too great.%0a%0apossible: pole shift has melted and opened up Antarctica as the new frontier.  It used to be at the south pole now it is in the atlantic (hearkening to atlantis).  You and your group now have to journey to this new land picking up any stragglers who are alone and including them on your voyage (hearkening to "over the mountain" in the boy and his dog, or the reservation in brave new world).%0a%0ashould be reminiscent and relatable to modern times but their technology is different than our modern world.  The player realizes perhaps it is not exactly our time.  %0a%0aIt is set thousands of years in the future but they have no knowledge of our timing system, only a vague sense of important events in history.  Artifacts that we would recognize are very rare and are from "the time before time".  They are in year ~1400 or according to their own timing scale since "the year of the Great comet and the meteor that crossed the moon".  Power was given over a fourth of the earth to kill by sword, famine and plague, and by the wild beasts of the earth.  After that time 1000 years were peaceful and there was advanced and open technology and everyone worked together, but then things became dark and selfish.  400  years of oppressions had lead to and culminated in the collapse of the lives we loved.  Now we have to hearken back to the old times and remember how to work together and bring prosperity to all once again.%0a%0aIn the collapse we just experienced paraphrase: There was a great earthquake. The sun turned black like sackcloth made of goat hair, the whole moon turned blood red, and the stars in the sky fell to earth, as figs drop from a fig tree when shaken by a strong wind. The heavens receded like a scroll being rolled up, and every mountain and island was removed from its place. Then the kings of the earth, the princes, the generals, the rich, the mighty, and everyone else, both slave and free, hid in caves and among the rocks of the mountains. They called to the mountains and the rocks, “Fall on us and hide us".  Then we survivors were left alone.  No government, no friends and family, we had to find eachother and start something new.  We have to use our skills and abilities to work together to create something new and great.%0a%0a!!Design notes%0a%0aAD&D first edition was hardcore [[https://www.polygon.com/2014/7/14/5898063/the-dice-can-kill-you-why-first-edition-ad-d-is-king|#]] but it makes sense for a tabletop game that should be over in a few hours.%0a%0aHistory of AD&D [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VI2ONHJ7GE&list=TLPQMTMwNzIwMjIcLEwLs-CmxQ&index=2|#]] including OSRIC and this [[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=nvU2P4q4_v4|#]] long history [[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=y6ssk9xf_7U|#]] forgotten realms [[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=pPF1pqpCfUY|#]] planescape [[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=N_toHmhhjK0|#]] borderlands [[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6DSDzgMeec|#]] saving throws [[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=vufj0-1AGFU|#]]%0a%0aDifferences between types of dnd.

And looking around doesn't mean "go into 100ft birds eye view to make sure there is nothing around you" it would mean actually turning around and looking around you.%0a%3c %0a

He tells you to gaina  few levels in the starter zone, get some food and drink, buy a lantern, and follow the trails to get to him.  Or going to Unrest throuh perilous terrain and waiting for boats with others at the docks.  I remember as a 13 year old playing everquest with only 3 hour play windows after homework, that sometimes I would be content ifI was just able to travel to a target destination in those 3 hours and it was fun and adventurous and I met new people and experienced difficulties.  One time at the end of my 3 hours I fell off the boat at a zone line and drowned.  The whole next day of school was filled with anxiety as to whether I would ever be able to get my corpse back.  Or another time when I died with a group of people and had to log off, and nowthe wholenext day was anxiety that they were all able to help eachother recover their corpses but now I willbe on my own to get mine.  Also there was this fear that if you took too long to recover your corpse that it would be lost forever and despawn. I want to discover what it was about travel in everquest that made it so compelling.%0a

This can be great for a scheduled play time with friends that you know you won't have to be wasting all your time camping a randomly spawning moband then have to contest it against rivals.  While that experience I just described can be supremely rewarding, itisn't practical for many players.

So you can easily choose your stat rolls at creation and allocations throughthe levels to make either type in the same class.  Also some people tend to be more introverted in real life and extraverted online or vice versa.  I think the reason for this is that games are inherently an escape, so you tend to rather use your secondary function in games as a form of release from real life where you always lead with your primary.  Since a game doesn't really matter in real life, you tend to fall back on your secondary and more relaxing and impulsive function because stress doesn't force you into your primary.  This is mainly for casuals.  Once you become a hardcore gamer, you tend to use your real life personality because the stakes are higher and you feel like you must take the game seriously.  The classes in this game work perfectly for both casuals and hardcore players, and can adapt over time via your point allocation as you level.  Both hardcore and casual players of the same personality type are the same class, but will allocate stat points likely differently.%0a---%0a> When you get all your stats to 18, then the stat cap becomes 25.

Artifacts that we would recognize are very rare and are from "the time before time".  They are in year ~1400 or according to their own timing scale since "the year of the Great comet and the meteor that crossed the moon".  They were given power over a fourth of the earth to kill by sword, famine and plague, and by the wild beasts of the earth.

Now we have to hearken back to the old times and remember how to work together and bring prosperity to all once again.%0a---%0a> should be reminiscent and relatable to modern times but their technology is different than our modern world.
