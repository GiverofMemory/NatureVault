This is helped by getting enough sleep, but often this condition is coupled with [[insomnia]].  Rest often helps this type of person, and sleep deprivation makes the insomnia worse not better because the [[Listeria]] overgrows in sleep deprivation.  The cause of this is because [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granulocyte|granulocytes]] get affected in sleep deprivation[[https://www.sleepfoundation.org/articles/sleep-deprivation-effect-immune-system-mirrors-physical-stress|#]] and these cells are invaded by listeria.[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listeria_monocytogenes#Pathogenesis|#]]  . %0aExcercise can also make it worse by reducing cellular immunity which is countered with [[beta glucan]].  [[https://journals.lww.com/acsm-msse/Fulltext/2004/08000/Effects_of_Oat___Glucan_on_Innate_Immunity_and.9.aspx|#]] [[Listeria]] is fought with [[Ellagic Acid]].%0a%0aThe body shuts down/mutates certain genes like listr2 and others during chronic and multigenerational listeria infection.  Doing this limits the severity of Listeria infection, but at the same time causes diabetes.  Some of these genes actually reduce diabetes when mutated so that is why often times this form of diabetes never progresses past prediabetes and is thus not clinically defined.  Having type zero can enhance the other 3 types [[citation needed]].%0a%0aDiabetes enhances resistance to listeria, and this is likely due to fact that they were already infected which caused the diabetes.[[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6798248/ | #]]%0a%0aB6 mice are a mouse model for type 0 and are likely chronically and heritably infected with listeria and develop genetic changes that both make them more resistant to Listeria and at the same time more diabetic.[[https://minerva-access.unimelb.edu.au/bitstream/handle/11343/219305/Congenic%2520mice%2520reveal%2520genetic%2520epistasis%2520and%2520overlapping%2520disease%2520loci%2520for%2520autoimmune%2520diabetes%2520and%2520listeriosis.pdf?sequence=1 | #]]%0a%0aEnhanced resistance to listeria gained with CD18 knockout and enhanced suseptibility to streptococcus at the same time[[https://iai.asm.org/content/71/10/5986 | #]]%0a%0aPossible [[magnesium]] deficiency [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnesium_deficiency|#]]%0a%0a!![[#T1]] Type 1%0aType one diabetes is caused by [[Mycobacterium]] autoimmunity on pancreatic cells that produce insulin.  This causes a lack of insulin produced and can happen at any age.  The patient produces antibodies to certain mycobacterium protiens; which antibodies attack zinc transporters in the pancreatic b cells.  Mycobacterium is fought with [[garlic]].%0a%0aIn addition to [[mycobacterium]], [[toxoplasmosis]] can also cause destruction of pancreatic beta cells causing type 1 diabetes.%0a%0aNOD mice are likely type 1 diabetic from generational mycobacterium infection.%0a%0aType 1 related to TB infection [[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ben_Marais/publication/233656425_High_prevalence_of_Mycobacterium_tuberculosis_infection_and_disease_in_children_and_adolescents_with_type_1_diabetes_mellitus/links/55c95e0308aebc967df9182a.pdf | #]]%0a%0aMycobacterium likely trigger autoimmunity causing type 1 diabetes [[https://academic.oup.com/cid/article-pdf/46/1/148/964978/46-1-148.pdf | #]]%0a%0aMycobacterium associated with type 1 but not type 2 so is very likely the cause of the disease and not a result of high blood sugar.

Treating the patient with nicotinamide (flush free niacin) will help [[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30115969/ |#]] although it will likely cause overgrowth of the bacteria since it is a precursor to nicotinamide riboside.
