Kaempherol is like apigenin but has the mid hydroxy group like quercetin [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaempferol|#]].

[[Antioxidant]] effect aslo possible from rutin, luteolin, and chicoric acid.  Sonchus reduces [[oxidative stress]].  Apigenin also reduces [[LDL]] [[cholesterol]] [[ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6472148/|#]] which is a known cause of pwlpitations.  Also inhibits [[platelet]] aggregation thus reduces [[blood clots]] which is another cause of palpitations.  Apigenin in sowthistle also modulates glutamergic [[NMDA]] by [[opioid]] receptors [[https://www.redalyc.org/pdf/4960/Resumenes/Abstract_496053944003_2.pdf|#]] and thus also might be a good thing to take with [[salvia]] [[salvia divinorum]]. Compounds in sonchus [[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20428066/|#]]. Apigenin in [[yarrow]], [[mugwort]], [[wormwood]], [[chamomile]], [[tansy]], [[parsley]] [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6472148/|#]] reduces [[COX2]], strongly lowers [[IL6]] by interfering from action of [[IFNy]].  Lowers [[IL1]]b and [[TNFa]].  Lowers [[blood sugar]] lowers alpha glucosidase and increases [[insulin]].Increase the activity of cellular antioxidants like catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), Glutathione (GSH). Lowers [[High blood pressure]] and [[cholesterol]], what doesn't it do? Interacts with [[GABA]]a receptor and is an [[MAOI]]. Apigenin regulates cardiac gene expression [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10188251/|#]].  [[Parsley]] possibly the best source of apigenin [[https://web.archive.org/web/20220525174533/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6817918/|#]] but I think [[sowthistle]] has more.  Apigenin not particularly antimicrobial but might help with [[h pylori]] and [[streptpcoccus]] [[https://web.archive.org/web/20220525174533/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6817918/|#]]  which cause [[carditis]].  Does reduce hemolysin in [[staphylococcus]].  Apigenin boosts dopamine probably more specifically norepinephrine and reduces serotonin [[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/328234247_Phytochemical_investigation_of_Sonchus_oleraceus_FamilyAsteraceae_cultivated_in_Iraq_isolation_and_identification_of_quercetin_and_apigenin|#]].  Basil seems to do the opposite and boost serotonin.  Parsley very high in apigenin.  Apigenin 7 glucoside probably most abundant form in sonchus (sowthistle) prickly [[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317181649_Effects_of_Sonchus_asper_and_apigenin-7-glucoside_on_nociceptive_behaviors_in_mice|#]] perrenial [[https://www.mdpi.com/2297-8739/8/2/12|#]] in parsley it is apigenin 7 apioside [[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16407641/|#]] [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apiin|#]]. Also important in sowthistle is [[rutin]] [[beta sitosterol]] and [[luteolin]] [[https://web.archive.org/web/20230831110849/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5832116/|#]].  All the glycosides in sonchus [[https://web.archive.org/web/20230831110724/https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0031942283830313|#]] coumarins scopoletin and aesculetin were found as major constituents of Embergeria, Babcockia and Taeckholmia ,  lesser amount in some Sonchus species. flavone glycosides were: apigenin 7-glucuronide, apigenin 7-rutinoside, luteolin 7-glucoside, luteolin 7-glucuronide, luteolin 7-rutinoside and luteolin 7-glucosylglucuronide.  permeation order of the flavonoids is genistein > isoliquiritigenin > apigenin > puercetin > kaempferol > hesperidin > rutin > quercetin, where genistein is characterized by the highest permeation [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6472148/#|#]]. It also has better organ distribution than luteolin [[https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphar.2021.681477/full|#]]. Some differences between apigenin and other flavones [[https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphar.2021.681477/full|#]], apigenin docks on iron3 binding site in transferrin. Apigenin basically the best because genistein is too estrogenic [[https://www.academia.edu/download/44939666/Stimulatory_effect_of_genistein_and_apig20160420-16334-1nno0g.pdf|#]].  Beta glycosides most bioavailable forms [[https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2019/7010467/|#]]%0a%0aApigenin is a yellow crystal.%0a%0aOne user on amazon noticed [[migraine]] after 1 week taking apigenin.  Perhaps it was from depleting glucuronic acid, so sowthistle isthe best source for apigenin since it is pre conjugated with glucuronic acid.  Personally I noticed slight migraine a day or two taking prickly sowthistle that then went away as the days passed.  Perhaps curing my recurring migraine I have had presumably from [[strongyloides]] and [[h pylori]].%0a%0aApigenin can givebad dreams, very vivid and perhaps inception like.  Possibly from interaction with [[iron overload]] and/or [[homocysteine]].  [[Melatonin]] used to give me nightmares, bloody ones, I think that was from high homocysteine.  However these symptoms mean you probably need apigenin, or are missing a cofactor vitamin.%0a%0aApigenin: [[endocarditis]] [[IBD]] [[migraine]] [[lung]] [[inflammation]] [[sepsis]] [[cancer]] [[incontinence]] [[anxiety]] [[depression]] [[cholesterol]] [[high cholesterol]] [[high blood pressure]] [[blood sugar]] [[obesity]] [[weight loss]] [[bone]] [[https://supplements.selfdecode.com/blog/apigenin-top-11-science-based-health-benefits-apigenin/|#]].

Apigenin also reduces [[LDL]] [[cholesterol]] [[ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6472148/|#]] which is a known cause of pwlpitations.  Also inhibits [[platelet]] aggregation thus reduces [[blood clots]] which is another cause of palpitations.  Apigenin in sowthistle also modulates glutamergic [[NMDA]] by [[opioid]] receptors [[https://www.redalyc.org/pdf/4960/Resumenes/Abstract_496053944003_2.pdf|#]] and thus also might be a good thing to take with [[salvia]] [[salvia divinorum]]. Compounds in sonchus [[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20428066/|#]]. Apigenin in [[yarrow]], [[mugwort]], [[wormwood]], [[chamomile]], [[tansy]], [[parsley]] [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6472148/|#]] reduces [[COX2]], strongly lowers [[IL6]] by interfering from action of [[IFNy]].  Lowers [[IL1]]b and [[TNFa]].  Lowers [[blood sugar]] lowers alpha glucosidase and increases [[insulin]].Increase the activity of cellular antioxidants like catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), Glutathione (GSH). Lowers [[High blood pressure]] and [[cholesterol]], what doesn't it do? Interacts with [[GABA]]a receptor and is an [[MAOI]]. Apigenin regulates cardiac gene expression [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10188251/|#]].  [[Parsley]] possibly the best source of apigenin [[https://web.archive.org/web/20220525174533/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6817918/|#]] but I think [[sowthistle]] has more.  Apigenin not particularly antimicrobial but might help with [[h pylori]] and [[streptpcoccus]] [[https://web.archive.org/web/20220525174533/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6817918/|#]]  which cause [[carditis]].  Does reduce hemolysin in [[staphylococcus]].  Apigenin boosts dopamine probably more specifically norepinephrine and reduces serotonin [[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/328234247_Phytochemical_investigation_of_Sonchus_oleraceus_FamilyAsteraceae_cultivated_in_Iraq_isolation_and_identification_of_quercetin_and_apigenin|#]].  Basil seems to do the opposite and boost serotonin.  Parsley very high in apigenin.  Apigenin 7 glucoside probably most abundant form in sonchus (sowthistle) prickly [[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317181649_Effects_of_Sonchus_asper_and_apigenin-7-glucoside_on_nociceptive_behaviors_in_mice|#]] perrenial [[https://www.mdpi.com/2297-8739/8/2/12|#]] in parsley it is apigenin 7 apioside [[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16407641/|#]] [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apiin|#]]. Also important in sowthistle is [[rutin]] [[beta sitosterol]] and [[luteolin]] [[https://web.archive.org/web/20230831110849/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5832116/|#]].  All the glycosides in sonchus [[https://web.archive.org/web/20230831110724/https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0031942283830313|#]] coumarins scopoletin and aesculetin were found as major constituents of Embergeria, Babcockia and Taeckholmia ,  lesser amount in some Sonchus species. flavone glycosides were: apigenin 7-glucuronide, apigenin 7-rutinoside, luteolin 7-glucoside, luteolin 7-glucuronide, luteolin 7-rutinoside and luteolin 7-glucosylglucuronide.  permeation order of the flavonoids is genistein > isoliquiritigenin > apigenin > puercetin > kaempferol > hesperidin > rutin > quercetin, where genistein is characterized by the highest permeation [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6472148/#|#]]. It also has better organ distribution than luteolin [[https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphar.2021.681477/full|#]]. Some differences between apigenin and other flavones [[https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphar.2021.681477/full|#]], apigenin docks on iron3 binding site in transferrin. Apigenin basically the best because genistein is too estrogenic [[https://www.academia.edu/download/44939666/Stimulatory_effect_of_genistein_and_apig20160420-16334-1nno0g.pdf|#]].  Beta glycosides most bioavailable forms [[https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2019/7010467/|#]]%0a%3c %0a%3c Apigenin is a yellow crystal.%0a%3c %0a%3c One user on amazon noticed [[migraine]] after 1 week taking apigenin.  Perhaps it was from depleting glucuronic acid, so sowthistle isthe best source for apigenin since it is pre conjugated with glucuronic acid.  Personally I noticed slight migraine a day or two taking prickly sowthistle that then went away as the days passed.  Perhaps curing my recurring migraine I have had presumably from [[strongyloides]] and [[h pylori]].%0a%3c %0a%3c Apigenin can givebad dreams, very vivid and perhaps inception like.  Possibly from interaction with [[iron overload]] and/or [[homocysteine]].  [[Melatonin]] used to give me nightmares, bloody ones, I think that was from high homocysteine.  However these symptoms mean you probably need apigenin, or are missing a cofactor vitamin.%0a%3c %0a%3c Apigenin: [[endocarditis]] [[IBD]] [[migraine]] [[lung]] [[inflammation]] [[sepsis]] [[cancer]] [[incontinence]] [[anxiety]] [[depression]] [[cholesterol]] [[high cholesterol]] [[high blood pressure]] [[blood sugar]] [[obesity]] [[weight loss]] [[bone]] [[https://supplements.selfdecode.com/blog/apigenin-top-11-science-based-health-benefits-apigenin/|#]].

[[Naringenin]] along with apigenin promote sleep best of polyphenols.  Naringenin is identical to apigenin but is missing a double bond and is thus less antiinflammatory and more antibacterial it seems.%0a%3c %0a%3c [[Vitamin P]]: vitamin c requires apigenin (or something similar) to cure [[scurvy]] [[https://www.nature.com/articles/138027a0?error=cookies_not_supported&code=2d052529-65dc-49d2-8504-c236208f9f02|#]] thus [[nettle]] and [[sowthistle]] must be taken together.%0a%3c %0a%3c [[Salicylate]] may be essential like [[salicin]] however if you are low on [[flavanoid]] like [[apigenin]] then they may be too oxidative.%0a%3c %0a%3c Decent apigenin explainer [[https://wildfreeorganic.com/wellness/health-benefits-of-apigenin|#]]%0a%3c %0a%3c Linus pauling overview flavonoids [[https://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/dietary-factors/phytochemicals/flavonoids|#]]%0a%3c %0a%3c Phytoestrogens in cancer [[https://www.bcpp.org/resource/phytoestrogens/|#]]%0a%3c %0a%3c Info about traditional uses of prickly sowthistle [[https://www.healthbenefitstimes.com/prickly-sow-thistle/|#]] biological control is ecoterrorism.%0a%3c %0a%3c Plantnet project [[https://uses.plantnet-project.org/en/Sonchus_asper_%2528PROTA%2529|#]]%0a%3c %0a%3c Pliny and disocorides wrote about it and it was known that ithas similar properties to dandelion and succory [[https://botanical.com/botanical/mgmh/s/sowthi71.html|#]].
