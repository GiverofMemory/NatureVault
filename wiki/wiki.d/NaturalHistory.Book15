HOW LONG IT EXISTED ONLY IN GREKX'K. %0a%0aAT WHAT PERIOD IT WAS EIKST INTfiODUCED INTO ITALY, SPAIN, %0aAND AFRICA. %0a%0aTheophrastcs,^ one of the most famous among the Gret-k %0awriters, who flourished about the year 440 of the City oi %0aRome, has asserted that the olive'* does not grow at a distance %0aof more than forty ^ miles from the sea. Fenestclla tells us %0athat in the year of Rome 173, being the reign of Tarquinius %0aPriscus, it did not exist in Italy, Spain, or Africa;^ whereas %0aat the present day it has crossed the Alps even, and has been %0aintroduced into the two provinces of Gaul and the middle of %0aSpain. In the year of Rome 505, Appius Claudius, grandson %0aof Appius Claudius Caecus, and L. Junius being consuls, twelve %0apounds of oil sold for an as ; and at a later period, in the year %0aG80, M. Seius, son of Lucius, the curule cedile, regulated the %0aprice of olive oil at Rome, at the rate of ten pounds for the as, %0afor the whole year. A person will be the less surprised at %0athis, when he learns that twenty-two years after, in the third %0aconsulship of Cn. Pompcius, Italy was able to export olive oil %0ato the provinces. , , %0a%0aHesiod,^ who looked upon an acquaintance with agriculture %0a%0a1 Hist.

THE NATURE OF THE OLIVE, AND OF NEW OLIVE OIL. %0a%0aFabianus maintains that the olive will grow' neither in %0avery cold climates, nor yet in very hot ones. VirgiP has %0amentioned three varieties of the olive, the orchites,' the %0aradius,^ and the posia;' and says that they require no rakiug %0aor pinning, nor, in fact, any attention whatever. There is no %0adoubt that in the case of these plants, soil and climate are the %0athings of primary importance ; but still, it is usual to prune %0athem at the same time as the vine, and they are improved by %0alopping between them every here and there. The gathering of %0athe olive follows that of the grape, and there is even a greater %0adegree of skill required in preparing'" oil than in making %0aAvine ; for the very same olives will frequently give quite %0adifferent results. The first oil of all, produced from the raw " %0aolive before it has begun to ripen, is considered preferable %0ato all the others in flavour ; in this kind, too, the first drop- %0apings of the press are the most esteemed, diminishing gradually %0ain goodness and value ; and this, whether the wicker-work %0abasket is used in making it, or whether, following the more %0a%0a•'' This is the case. We may remark that the tree will grow in this %0acountry, but the fruit never comes to maturity. %0a%0a« Georg. ii. 85, also ii. 420. %0aProbably the Olea maximo fnictu of Toumefort.

It is %0aslightly bitter. %0a%0a'f' This is so much the case, that though the olives of Spain and Por- %0atugal are among the finest, their oils are of the very worst quality. %0a%0aIt does not appear that the method of preparing oil by the use of %0aboiling water was known to the ancients. Unripe olives produce an ex- %0acellent oil, but in very small quantities. Hence they are rarely used for %0athe purpose. %0a%0a12 Called "virgin," or "native" oil in France, and very highly esteemed. %0aSporta. %0a%0a%0a%0aC1..I,. 3.] %0a%0a%0a%0aOLIVK OIL. %0a%0a%0a%0arecent plan, the pulp is put in a stick strainer, with narro-.v %0aspikes and interstices.'* The riper the berry, the more unctu- %0aous the juice, and the less agreeable the taste.'' To obtain a %0aresult botli abundant and of excellent flavour, the best time to %0agather it is when the berrj' is just on the point of turning %0ablack. In this state it is called " druppa" by us, by the %0aGreeks, " drypetis." %0a%0aIn addition to these distinctions, it is of importance to %0aobserve whether the berry ripens in the press or while on fhe %0abranch ; whether the tree has been watered, or whether the %0afruit has been nurtured solely by its own juices, and has %0aimbibed nothing else but the dews of heaven. %0a%0aCHAP. 3. (2.) OLIVE OIL : THE COUNTBIES IN WHICH IT IS %0a%0a• PKODTTCED, AND ITS VAKIOUS ftTTALITIES. %0a%0aIt is not with olive oil as it is with wine, for by age it ac- %0aquires a bad flavour,'" and at the end of a year it is already %0aold. This, if rightly understood, is a wise provision on the %0apart of Nature: wine, which is only produced for the drunkard, %0ashe has seen no necessity for us to use when new ; indeed, %0aby the fine flavour which it acquires with age, she rather %0ain\dte3 us to keep it ; but, on the other hand, she has not wil.'ed %0athat we should be thus sparing of oil, and so has reudered its %0ause common and universal by the very necessity there is of using %0ait while fresh. %0a%0aIn the production of this blessing as Avell," Italy holds the %0ahighest rank among all countries,'® and more pailicuhu'ly the %0aterritory of Venafrum," that part of it in especial which %0aproduces the Licinian oil ; the qualities of which have confe rred %0aupon the Licinian olive tho very highest renowu.

The oil of Aix is particularly esteeni.d. %0a%0a>9 In Campania. See B. xvii. c. 3. Horace and Martial speak in %0apraise of the Venafran olive, llardouin suggests that Lieinius Cruasiw %0amay have introduced the Licinian olive. %0a%0a%0a%0a280 %0a%0a%0a%0aplihy's natural history. %0a%0a%0a%0a[Book XV. %0a%0a%0a%0aunguents which have brought this oil into such great esteem, %0athe peculiar odour of it adapting itself so well to the full %0adevelopement of their qualities; at the same time its delicate Hu- %0avour equally enlists the palate in its beiialf. In addition to %0athis, birds will never touch the berry of tlie Licinian olive. %0a%0aJText to Italy, the contest is maintained, and on very equal %0aterms, between the territories of Istria and of Boetica. The %0anext rank for excellence is claimed by the other provinces of %0aour Empire, with the exception of Africa,-" the soil of which %0ais better adapted for grain. That country Nature has given %0aexclusively to the cereals ; of oil and wine she has all but %0adeprived it, securing it a sufficient share of renown by its %0aabundant harvests. As to the remaining particulars connected %0awith the olive, they are replete with erroneous notions, and I %0ashall have occasion to show that there is no part of our agri- %0acultural economy upon which people have been more gene- %0arally mistaken. %0a%0a(3.) The olive is composed of a stone, oil, flesh, and %0aamurca the last being a bitter liquid, principally composed %0aof water ; hence it is that in seasons of drought it is less plen- %0atiful, and more abundant when rains have prevailed. The %0aoil is a juice peculiar to the olive, a fact more particularly %0astated in reference to its unripe state, as we have already %0amentioned when speaking of omphacium.^^ This oil continues %0aon the increase up to the rising of Arcturus," or in other %0awords, the sixteenth day before the calends of October ; " after %0awhich the increase is in the stone and the flesh. When drought %0ahas been followed by abundant rains, the oil is spoilt, and %0aturns to amurca. It is the colour of this amurca that makes %0athe olive turn black; hence, when the berry is just beginning %0ato turn that colour, there is but little amurca in it, and before %0athat period none at all. It is an error then, on the part of %0apersons, to suppose that that is the commencement of maturity, %0a%0a=0 The heat of Africa is unfavourable to the olive. %0a%0a'^^ The faeces, marc, or lees. This is a crude juice contained in the %0acellular tissue of the fruit, known as viridine or cJilorophylk. %0a%0aThis is owing, P'ee says, to a sort of fermentation, which alters the %0atissue of the cells containing the oil, displaces the constituent elements, %0aand forms others, such as mucus, sugar, acetic acid, ammoniac, &c. "When %0aripe, the olive contains four oils ; that of the skin, the flesh, the stone, %0aand the kernel. %0a%0aIn B. xii, c. 60. 2^ See B. xviii. c. 74. %0a%0a^ 16th of September. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 4.] %0a%0a%0a%0aFIFTEEN VAUIETIES OF OLTTEa. %0a%0a%0a%0a281 %0a%0a%0a%0awhich IS in reality only the near approach of corruption. A %0asecond error, too, is the supposition lliat the oil increases pro- %0aportionably to the flesh of the berry, it being the fact that the %0aoil IS all the time undergoing a change into flesh, and the stono %0aIS growing larger and larger within. It is for this reason %0amore particularly, that care is taken to water the tree at this %0aperiod ; the real result of all this care and attention, as well as %0aof the fall of copious rains, being, that the oil in reality is %0aabsorbed as the berry increases in size, unless fine dry weather %0ashould happen to set in, which naturally tends to contract the %0avolume of the fruit. According to Theophrastus.^" heat is the %0asole primary cause of the oleaginous principle ; for which reason %0ait is, that in the presses,'^' and in the cellars even, great fii'es %0aare lighted to improve the quality of the oil. %0a%0aA third error arises from misplaced economy : to spare the %0aexpense of gathering, people are in the habit of waiting till the %0aberry falls from tlie tree. Others, again, who wish to follow a %0amiddle course in this respect, beat the fruit off with poles, and %0aso inflict injury on the tree and ensure loss in the succeeding %0ayear ; indeed, there was a very ancient regulation in existence %0arelative to the gathering of the olive — "Neither pull nor %0abeat the olive-tree.-^" Those who would observe a still greater %0adegree of precaution, strike the branches lightly with a reed on %0aone side of thera ; but even then the tree is reduced to bearing %0afruit but once in two years,-' in consequence of the injury done %0ato the buds. Not less injurious, however, are the results of %0awaiting till the berries fall from the tree ; for, by remaining on %0ait beyond the proper time, they deprive the crop that is coming %0aon of its due share of nutriment, by occupying its place : a %0aclear proof of which is, that if they are not gathered before the %0awest winds prevail, they are found to have acquired renewed %0astrength, and are all the later before they fall. %0a%0aCHAP. 4. FIFTEEN VARIETIES OF OLIVES. %0a%0aThe first olive that is gathered after the autumn is that %0a»« De Causis, B. i. c. 23. %0a%0a-" This cannot possibly increase the oil, but it would render it more %0afluid, and thereby facilitate its escape from the cells of the berry. %0a%0a28 But Cato, Re Rust. c. 144, adds the very significant words, " injussu %0adomini aut custodis." " Without the leave of the owner or the keeper." %0a%0a29 It is found that the olive, after an abundant season, will not bear in %0athe following year ; probably the result of exhaustion. %0a%0a%0a%0a282 %0a%0a%0a%0apliny's nattjual niftTonY. %0a%0a%0a%0a[Dook XV. %0a%0a%0a%0akno^n as the " posia,"^" the berry of which, owing to a vicious %0amethod of cultivation, and not any fault on tlio part of Na- %0ature, has the most flesh upon it. Next to this is the orchites, %0awhich contains the greatest quantity of oil, and then, after %0athat, the radius. As these are of a peculiarly delicate nature, %0athe heat very rapidly takes effect upon them, and the amurca %0athey contain causes them to fall. On the other hand, the %0agathering of the tough, hard-skinned olive is put off so late as %0athe month of March, it being well able to resist the effects of %0amoisture, and, consequently, very small. Those varieties known %0aas the Licinian, the Cominian, the Contian, and the Sergian, %0aby the Sabines called the "royal"'' olive, do not turn black %0abefore the west winds prevail, or, in other words, before the %0asixth day before'^ the ides of February. At this period it is %0agenerally thought that they begin to ripen, and as a most ex- %0acellent oil is extracted from them, experience would seem to %0agive its support to a theory which, in reality, is altogether %0awrong. The growers say that in the same degree that cold %0adiminishes the oil, the ripeness of the berry augments it; %0awhereas, in reality, the goodness of the oil is owing, not to %0athe period at which the olives are gathered, but to the natural %0aproperties of this peculiarvariety, in which the oil is remark- %0aably slow in turning to amurca. %0a%0aA similar error, too, is committed by those who keep the %0aolives, when gathered, upon a layer of boards, and do not %0apress the fruit till it has thrown out a sweat; it being the %0afact that every hour lost tends to diminish the oil and increase %0athe amurca : the consequence is, that, according to the ordi- %0anary computation, a modius of olives yields no more than six %0apounds of oil. No one, however, ever takes account of the %0aquantity of amurca to ascertain, in reference to the same %0akind of berry, to Avhat extent it increases daily in amount. %0aThen, again, it is a very general error'^ among practical per- %0asons to suppose that the oil increases proportion ably to the %0aincreased size of the berry ; and more particularly so when it %0ais so clearly proved that such is not the case, with reference to %0a%0a^ More commonly spelt " pausia." %0a%0a"Regia." It is impossible to identify these varieties. %0a*2 8th of February. %0a%0a'3 This assertion of Pliny is not generally true. The large olives of %0aSpain yield oil very plentifully. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 4.] %0a%0a%0a%0aFIFTEEIT VAIIIETIES OF 0LITE3. %0a%0a%0a%0a283 %0a%0a%0a%0athe variety known as the royal olive, by some called majorina %0aand by others phaulia this berry being of the very largest %0aBize, and yet yielding a minimum of juice. In Egypt,-'* too, %0athe berries, whicli are remarkably meaty, are found to produce %0abut very little oil; while tliose of Decapolis, in Syria, are so %0aextremely small, that tliey are no bigger tllan a caper ; and %0ayet they are highly esteemed for their tiesh.-'« It is for this %0areason that the olives from tlie parts beyond sea are preferred %0afor table to those of Italy, though, at the same time, they are %0avery inferior to them for making oil. %0a%0aIn Italy, those of Picenum and of Sidicina^^ are considered %0athe best for table. These are kept apart from the others and %0asteeped in salt, after which, like other olives, they are put in %0aamurca, or else boiled wine; indeed, some of them are left to %0afloat solely in their own oil,^^ without any adventitious mode %0aof preparation, and are then known as colymbades : sometimes %0athe berry is crushed, and then seasoned with green herbs to %0allavour it. Even in an unripe state the olive is rendered fit %0afor eating by being sprinkled with boiling water ; it is quito %0asurprising, too, how readily it will imbibe sweet juices, and %0aretain an adventitious Havour from foreign substances. With %0athis fruit, as with the grape, there are purple^" varieties, and %0athe posia is of a complexion approaching to black. Besides %0athose already mentioned, there are thesuperba^" and a remark- %0aably luscious kind, which dries of itself, and is even sweeter %0athan the raisin : this last variety is extremelj- rare, and is to %0a%0aProbably a member of the variety known to naturalists as the Oka %0afructu majon, came crassa, of Tournefort. the royal olive or " triparde " of %0atlie French.

(4.) — THE NATUEE OF OLIVE OIL. %0a%0aIt is one of the properties of oil to impart warmth to the %0abody, and to protect it against the action of cold ; while at %0athe same time it promotes coolness in the head when heated. %0aThe Greeks, those parents of all vices, have abused it by mak- %0aing it minister to luxury, and employing it commonly in the %0agymnasium : indeed, it is a well-known fact that the gover- %0anors of those establishments have sold the scrapings" of the %0aoil used there for a sum of eighty thousand sesterces.

(5.) — THE CTTLTrTRE OP THE OLIVE: ITS MODE OF PKE- %0aSEttVATlOX. THE METHOD OF MAKING OLIVE OIL. %0a%0aWe will now proceed to mention the precepts given by Cato^* %0ain relation to this subject. Upon a warm, rich"*' soil, he %0arecommends us to sow the greater radius, the Salentina, the %0aorchitcs, the posia, the Sergian, the Cominian, and the albi- %0acera;*" but with a remarkable degree of prudence he adds, %0athat those varieties ought to be planted in preference which %0aare considered to thrive best in the neighbouring localities. In %0aa cold*' and meagre soil he says that the Licinian olive should %0abe planted ; and he informs us tliat a rich or hot soil has the %0aeffect, in this last varietj-, of spoiling the oil, while the tree %0abecomes exhausted by its own fertility, and is liable to be %0aattacked by a sort of red moss.** He states it as his opinion %0athat the olive grounds oiight to have a western aspect, and, %0aindeed, he approves of no other. %0a%0a(6.) According to him, the best method of preserving olives %0ais to put the orchitcs and the posia, while green, in a strong %0abrine, or else to bruise them first, and preserve them in niastich %0aoil."^ The more bitter the olive, he says, the better the oil ; %0abut they should be gathered from the ground the verj- moment %0athey fall, and washed if they are dirty. He says that three %0adays will be quite sufficient for drying them, and that if it %0ais frosty weather, they should be pressed on the fourth, care %0abeing taken to sprinkle them with salt. Olives, he informs %0airs,*' lose oil by being kept in a boarded store-room, and dete- %0ariorate in quality ; the same being the case, too, if the oil is %0a%0aOr " oleaster."

A third pil is that %0amade of the fruit of the cicus,"' a tree which grows in Egypt %0ain great abundance ; by some it is known as croton, by others %0aas sili, and by others, again, as wild sesamuin : it is not so very %0along since this tree was first introduced here. In Spain, too, %0ait shoots up with great rapidity to the size of the olive-tree, %0ahaving a stem like that of the ferula, the leaf of the \ine, %0aand a seed that bears a resemblance to a small ])ale grape. %0aOur people are in the habit of calling it " riciniis,"" from the %0arcsembbiuce of the seed to that insect. It is boiled in water," %0aand the oil that swims on the surface is then skimmed off : %0abut in Egypt, where it grows in a greater abundance, the oil is %0aextracted without employing either fire or water for the ])ur- %0a])0se, the seed being first sprinkled with salt, and then sub- %0ajected to pressure : eaten with food this oil is repulsive, but it %0ais very useful for burning in lamps. %0a%0aAmygdalinum, by some persons known as " metopium,"^ %0a%0a8' It may be remarked, that in this Chapter Pliny totally confounds %0afixed oils, Volatile oils, and medicinal oils.

An %0aoil is extracted from the laurel also, with the aid of olive oil. %0aSome persons use the berries only for this purpose, while %0aothers, again, employ the leaves* and the outer skin of the %0aberries : some add storax also, and other odoriferous sub- %0astances. The best kind for this purpose is the broad-leaved or %0awild laurel,^* with a black berry. The oil, too, of the black %0amyrtle is of a similar nature ; that with the broad leaf'" is %0areckoned also the best. The berries are first sprinkled with %0awarm water, and then beaten, after Avhich they are boiled : %0asome persons take the more tender leaves, and boil tliem in %0aolive oil, and then subject them to pressure, while others, again, %0asteep them in oil, and leave the mixture to ripen in the sun. %0aThe same method is also adopted with the cultivated myrtle, %0abut the wild variety with small berries is generally preferred ; %0aby some it is known as the oxymyrsine, by others as the cha- %0amaemyrsine, and by others, again, as the acoron," from its %0astrong resemblance to that plant, it being sliort and branching. %0a%0aAn oil is made, too, from the citrus," and from the cypress ; %0aalso, from the walnut," and known by the name of " carj'i- %0anon,"'* and from the fruit of the cedar, being generally %0aknown as " pisselaeon.""

THE PEACH. %0a%0aThe name of " Persica," or " Persian apple," given to this %0afruit, fully proves that it is an exotic in both Greece as well %0aas Asia,*^ and that it was first introduced from Persis. As to %0athe wild plum, it is a well-known fact that it will grow any- %0awhere ; and I am, therefore, the more surprised that no men- %0ation has been made of it by Cato, more particularly as he has %0apointed out the method of preserving several of the wild %0afruits as well. As to the peach-tree, it has been only intro- %0aduced of late ygars, and with considerable difficulty ; so much %0aso, that it is perfectly barren in the Isle of llhodes, the first %0aresting-place^ that it found after leaving Egypt. %0a%0aIt is quite untrue that the peach which grows in Persia is %0apoisonous, and produces dreadful tortures, or that the kings %0aof that countr)^, from motives of revenge, had it transplanted %0ain Egypt, where, through the nature of the soil, it lost all its %0aevil properties — for we find that it is of the " persea"^^ that %0athe more careful writers have stated all this,*'' a totally different %0atree, the fruit of which resembles the red myxa, and, indeed, %0acannot be successfully cultivated anywhere but in the East. %0aThe learned have also maintained that it was not introduced %0afrom Persis into Egypt with the view of inflicting punishment, %0abut say that it was planted at Memphis by Perseus ; for %0awhich reason it was that Alexander gave orders that the vic- %0ators should be crowned with it in the games which he insti- %0atuted there in honour of his'* ancestor : indeed, this tree has %0aalways leaves and fruit upon it, growing immediately upon the %0aothers.

Hence it is that we %0ahave fruits which derive their names from Matius,*^ Cestius, %0aMallius, and Scandius. Appius, too, a member of the %0aClaudian family, grafted the quince on the Scandian fruit, in %0aconsequence of which the produce is known as the Appian. %0aThis fruit has the smell of the quince, and is of the same size %0aas the Scandian apple, and of a ruddy colour. Let no one, %0ahowever, imagine that this name was merely given in a spirit %0aof flattery to an illustrious family, for there is an apple known %0aas the Sceptian,™ which owes its name to the son of a freed- %0aman, who was the first to introduce it : it is remarkable for %0athe roundness of its shape. To those already mentioned, %0aCato''^ adds the Quirinian and the Scantian varieties, which %0alast, he says, keep remarkably well in large vessels."^ The %0alatest kind of all, however, that has been introduced is the %0asmall apple known as the Petisian,''^ remarkable for its delight- %0aful flavour : the Amerinian''* apple, too, and the little Greek'* %0ahave conferred renown on their respective countries. %0a%0aThe remaining varieties have received their name from %0avarious circumstances — the apples known as the "gemella"^* %0aare always found hanging in pairs upon one stalk, like twins, %0a%0aSee B. xii. c. 6.

EXPIATIONS %0aFOR LIGHTKING. %0a%0aThis br^ch of civilized life has long since been brought to %0athe very highest pitch of perfection, for man has left nothing %0auntried here. Hence it is that we find Virgil speaking of %0agrafting the nut-tree on the arbutus, the apple on the plane, %0aand the cheiTy on the elm. Indeed, there is nothing further %0aill this department that can possibly be devised, and it is a %0along time since any new variety of fruit has been discovered, %0alieligious scruples, too, wiU not allow of indiscriminate graft- %0aing ; thus, for instance, it is not permitted to graft upon the %0athorn, for it is not easy, by any mode of expiation, to avoid %0athe disastrous effects of lightning; and we are told*' that as %0amany as are the kinds of trees that have been engrafted on the %0athorn, so many are the thunderbolts that will be hurled against %0athat spot in a single flash. %0a%0aThe form of the pear is turbinated ; the later kinds remain %0aon the parent tree till winter, when they ripen with the frost ; %0asuch, for instance, as the Greek variety, the ampullaceum, and %0athe laureum ; the same, too, with apples of the Amerinian %0aand the Scandian kinds.

(16.) — XHE MODE OF KEEPING VAEIOTJS FKUlTS AND %0aGKAPES. %0a%0aFor the better preserving of fruits it is universally recom- %0amended that the storeroom should be situate in a cool, dry %0aspot, with a well-boarded floor, and windows looking towards %0athe north ; which in fine weather ought to be kept open. Care %0ashould also be taken to keep out the south wind by window %0apanes,-* while at the same time it should be borne in mind that %0aa north-east wind will shrivel fruit and make it unsightly. Ap- %0aples are gathered alter the autumnal equinox ; but the gather- %0aiug should never begin before the sixteenth day of the moon, %0aor before the first hour of the day. Windfalls should always %0abe kept separate, and there ought to be a layer of straw, or %0aelse mats or chaff, placed beneath. They should, also, be %0aplaced apart from each other, in rows, so that the air may cir- %0aculate freely between them, and they may equally gain the %0abenefit of it. The Amerinian apple is the best keeper, the %0amelimelum the very worst of all. %0a%0a(17.) Quinces ought to be stored in a place kept perfectly %0aclosed, so as to exclude all draughts ; or else they should be %0aboiled in honey or soaked in it.

M. Varro -® recommends that they should be kept in %0alarge vessels filled with sand : if they are not ripe, he says %0athat they should be put in pots with the bottom broken out, %0aand then buried^^ in the earth, all access to the air being care- %0afully shut, and care being first taken to cover the stalk with %0apitch. By this mode of treatment, he assures us, they will %0aattain a larger size than they would if left to ripen on the tree. %0aAs for the other kinds of pomes, he says that they should be %0awrapped up separately in fig-leaves, the windfalls being care- %0afully excluded, and then stored in baskets of osier, or else %0acovered over with potters' earth. %0a%0aPears are kept in earthen vessels pitched inside ; when %0afilled, the vessels are reversed and then buried in pits. The %0aTarentine pear, Varro says, is gathered very late, while the %0aAnician keeps very well in raisin wine. Sorb apples, too, are %0asimilarly kept in holes in the ground, the vessel being turned %0aupside down, and a layer of plaster placed on the lid: it should be %0aburied two feet deep, in a sunny spot; sorbs^°are also hung, like, %0agrapes, in the inside of large vessels, together with the branches. %0a%0aSome of the more recent authors are found to pay a more %0ascrupulous degree of attention to these various particulars, and %0arecommend that the gathering of grapes or pomes, which are %0aintended for keeping, should take place while the moon is on %0athe wane,^' after the third hour of the day, and while the %0aweather is clear, or dry winds prevail. In a similar manner, %0athe selection, they say, ought to be made from a dry spot, and %0athe fruit should be plucked before it is fully ripe, a moment %0abeing chosen while the moon is below the horizon. Grapes, %0athey say, should be selected that have a strong, hard mallet- %0astalk, and after the decayed berries have been carefully re- %0amoved with a pair of scissors, they should be hung up inside of %0a%0a" As Fee remarks, the fruit, if treated thus, would soon lose all the %0aproperties for which it is valued. %0a2s De Re Rust.

The same method, they say, should be adopted %0afor keeping sorb apples and pears, the stalks being carefully %0acovered with pitch ; care should be taken, too, that the ves- %0asels are kept at a distance from water. %0a%0aThere are some persons who adopt the following method for %0apreserving grapes. They take them off together with the %0abranch, and place them, while still upon it, in a layer of %0aplaster,^- taking care to fasten either end of the branch in a %0abulb of squill.^^ Others, again, go so far as to place them %0awithin vessels containing wine, taking care, however, that the %0agrapes, as they hang, do not touch it. Some persons put %0aapples in plates of earth, and then leave them to float in wine, %0aa method by which it is thought that a vinous flavour is im- %0aparted to them : while some think it a better plan to preserve all %0athese kinds of fruit in millet. Most people, however, content %0athemselves with first digging a hole in the ground, a couple of %0afeet in depth ; a layer of sand is then placed at the bottom, %0aand the fruit is arranged upon it, and covered with an earthen %0alid, over which the earth is thrown. Some persons again even %0ago so far as to give their grapes a coating of potters' chalk, and %0athen hang them up when dried in the sun ; when required for %0ause, the chalk is removed with water.^* Apples are also pre- %0aserved in a similar manner ; but with them wine is employed %0afor getting off the chalk. Indeed, wc find a very similar plan %0apursued with apples of the finest quality ; they have a coating %0alaid upon them of either plaster or wax ; but they are apt, if %0anot quite ripe when this was done, by the increase in their %0asize to break their casing."** When apples are thus prepared, %0athey are always laid with the stalk downwards.^^ Some %0apersons pluck the apple together with the branch, the ends of %0awhich they thrust into the pith of elder, and then bury it in %0a%0a32 A method not milikcly to spoil the grape, from the difficulty of re- %0amoving the coat thus given to it. %0a%0a3» A verj' absurd notion, as Fee observes.

III. ^ %0a%0a%0a%0a306 PLINt's NATUEA-L niSTOEX. [Book XV. %0a%0a%0a%0athe way already pointed out.^" There are some who assign to %0aeach apple or pear its separate vessel of clay, and after care- %0afully pitching the cover, enclose it again in a larger vessel : %0aoccasionally, too, the fruit is placed on a layer of flocks of %0awool, or else in baskets,^'' with a lining of chaff and clay. %0aOther persons follow a similar plan, but use earthen plates for %0athe purpose ; while others, again, employ the same method, %0abut dig a hole in the earth, and after placing a layer of sand, %0alay the fruit on top of it, and then cover the whole with dry %0aearth. Persons, too, are sometimes known to give quinces a %0acoating of Pontic^* wax, and then plunge them in honey. %0a%0aColumella^* informs us, that fruit is kept by being carefully %0aput in earthen vessels, which then receive a coating of pitch, and %0aare placed in wells or cisterns to sink to the bottom. The people %0aof maritime Liguria, in the vicinity of the Alps, first dry their %0agrapes in the sun,"*" and wrap them up in bundles of rushes, %0awhich are then covered with plaster. The Greeks follow a %0asimilar plan, but substitute for rushes the leaves of the plane- %0atree, or of the vine itself, or else of the fig, which they dry %0afor a single day in the shade, and then place in a cask in %0aalternate layers with husks" of grapes. It is by this method %0athat they preserve the grapes of Cos and Berytus, which are %0ainferior to none in sweetness. Some persons, when thus pre- %0aparing them, plunge the grapes into He-ashes the moment they %0atake them from the vine, and then dry them in the sun ; they %0athen steep them in warm water, after which they put them to %0adry again in the sun : and last of all, as already mentioned, %0awrap them up in bundles formed of layers of leaves and grape %0ahusks. There are some who prefer keeping their grapes in %0asawdust,''^ or else in shavings of the fir-tree, poplar, and ash : %0awhile others think it the best plan to hang them up in the %0agranary, at a careful distance from the apples, directly after the %0agathering, being under the impression that the very best cover- %0aing for them as they hang is the dust" that naturally arises %0a%0a2^ In a pit two feet deep, &c.

TWENTY-NINE VAEIETIES OF THE FIG. %0a%0aOf all the remaining fruits that are included under the %0aname of " pomes," the fig^* is the largest : some, indeed, equal %0athe pear, even, in size. "We have already mentioned, while %0atreating of the exotic fruits, the miraculous productions of %0aEgypt and Cyprus*® in the way of figs. The fig of Mount %0aIda" is red, and the size of an olive, rounder however, and %0alike a medlar in flavour; they give it the name of Alex- %0aandrian in those parts. The stem is a cubit in thickness ; it is %0abranchy, has a tough, pliant wood, is entirely destitute of all %0amilky juice,''® and has a green bark, and leaves like those of the %0alinden tree, but soft to the touch. Onesicritus states that in %0aHyrcauia the figs are much sweeter than with us, and that the %0atrees are more prolific, seeing that a single tree will bear as %0amuch as two hundred and seventy modii"*^ of fruit. The fig %0ahas been introduced into Italy from other countries, Chalcis %0aand Chios, for instance, the varieties being very numerous : %0athere are those from Lydia also, Avhich are of a purple colour, %0aand the kind known as the " mamillana,"^ which is very %0asimilar to the Lydian. The callistruthiae are very little supe- %0arior to the last in flavour ; they are the coldest by nature of %0aall the figs. As to the African fig, by many people preferred %0ato any other, it has been made the subject of very consider- %0aable discussion, as it is a kind that has been introduced very %0arecently into Africa, though it bears the name of that country. %0a%0awith which it adheres. In all these methods, little attention would seem %0ato be paid to the retention of the flavour of the fruits. %0a%0aA detestable practice, Fee says, as the oil makes an indelible mark %0aon the grape, and gives it an abominable flavour. It is the best method %0ato put the fruit in bags of paper or hair. %0a" See B. xiii. c. 19. %0a%0a*^ There are about forty varieties now known. %0a%0a*" B. xiii. c. 14, 15. These are the Ficus sycoraorus of Linnaeus. %0aIn Troas ; called the Alexandrian fig, from the city of Alexandria %0athere. Fee doubts if' this was really a fig, and suggests that it might be %0athe fruit of a variety of Diospyros. %0a%0a*8 No fig-tree now known is destitute of this. %0a%0a*8 Fee treats this as an exaggeration. %0a%0a40 From " mamilla," a teat. %0a%0aX 2 %0a%0a%0a%0a308 %0a%0a%0a%0aPLINX'S NATUEAL HISTOET. %0a%0a%0a%0a[Book XV. %0a%0a%0a%0aAs to the fig of Alexandria," it is a black variety, with the %0acleft inclining to white ; it has had the name given to it of %0athe " delicate"^- fig : the Ehodiau fig, too, and the Tiburtine," %0aone of the early kinds, are black. Some of them, again, bear %0athe name of the persons who were the first to introduce them, %0asuch, for instance, as the Livian^* and the Pompcian^^ figs : this %0alast variety is the best for drying in the sun and keeping for %0ause, from year to year ; the same is the case, too, with the %0amarisca,^ and the kind which has a leaf spotted all over like %0athe reed." There is also the Herculanean fig, the albicerata,** %0aand the white aratia, a very large variety, with an extremely %0adiminutive stalk. %0a%0aThe earliest of them all is the porphyritis,^^ which has a %0astalk of remarkable length : it is closely followed by the popu- %0alaris,*° one of the very smallest of the figs, and so called from %0athe low esteem in which it is held : on the other hand, the %0achelidonia" is a kind that ripens the last of all, and to- %0awards the beginning of winter. In addition to these, there are %0afigs that are at the same time both late and early, as they bear %0atwo crops in the year, one white and the other black,^^ ripen- %0aing at harvest-time and vintage respectively. There is another %0alate fig also, that has received its name from the singular %0ahardness of its skin ; one of the Chalcidian varieties bears as %0amany as three times in the year. It is at Tarentum only that %0athe remarkably sweet fig is grown which is known by the %0aname of " ona." %0a%0aSpeaking of figs, Cato has the following remarks : " Plant %0athe fig caUed the ' marisca' on a chalky or open site, but for %0athe African variety, the Herculanean, the Saguntine,^ the %0a%0aIn Egypt.

Being a small %0avariety of the fig-tree, they cover it up with manure at the end %0aof autumn, by which means the fruit on it is overtaken by %0awinter while still in a green state : then when the weather %0abecomes milder the fruit is uncovered along with the tree, and %0aso restored to light. Just as though it had come into birth %0aafresh, the fruit imbibes the heat of the new sun with the %0agreatest avidity — a difierent sun, in fact, to that which ori- %0aginally gave it life — and so ripens along with the blossom of %0athe coming crop ; thus attaining maturity in a year not its %0aown, and this in a country,'''' too, where the greatest cold %0aprevails. %0a%0aCUAP. 20. IIISTOltlCAL ANECDOTES CONNECTED WITH THE FIG. %0a%0a"The mention by Cato of the variety which bears the name %0aof the African fig, strongly recalls to my mind a remarkable %0afact connected with it and the countrj^ from which it takes %0aits name. %0a%0aBurning with a mortal hatred to Carthage, anxious, too, for the %0asafety of his posterity, and exclaiming at every sitting of the %0asenate that Carthage must be destroyed, Cato one day brought %0awith him into the Senate-house a ripe fig, the produce of that %0acountry . Exhibiting it to the assembled senators, " I ask you," %0asaid he, " when, do you suppose, this fruit was plucked from the %0atree ?" AU being of opinion that it had been but lately gathered, %0a— Know then," was his reply, "that this fig was plucked at %0aCarthage but the day before yesterday'^^-^so near is the enemy %0a%0aThe modern " black" tig. %0a"5 The sun of the former year. %0a%0aIn Moesia — the present Servia and Bulgaria. %0a" Another war is said to have originated in this fruit. Xerxes was %0atempted by the fine figs of Athens to undertake the invasion of Greece. %0a%0a"Tertium ante diem." In dating from an event, the Eomans in- %0a%0a%0a%0a310 %0a%0a%0a%0aPLIirr'S NATUEAL HISTOBT. %0a%0a%0a%0a[Book XV. %0a%0a%0a%0ato our walls." It was immediately after this occurrence that %0athe third Punic war commenced, in which Carthage was %0adestroyed, though Cato had breathed his last, the year after this %0aevent. In this trait which are we the most to admire ? was it %0aingenuity'^' and foresight on his part, or was it an accident that %0awas thus aptly turned to advantage ? which, too, ia the most %0asurprising, the extraordinary quickness of the passage which %0amust have been made, or the bold daring of the man ? The %0athing, however, that is the most astonishing of all — indeed, I %0acan conceive nothing more truly marvellous — is the fact that a %0acity thus mighty, the rival of ilome for the sovereignty of the %0aworld during a period of one hundred and twenty years, owed %0aits fall at last to an illustration drawn from a single fig ! %0a%0aThus did this fig effect that which neither Trebia nor Thrasi- %0amenus, not Cannaj itself, graced with the entombment of the %0aRoman renown, not the Punic camp entrenched within three %0amiles of the city, not even the disgrace of seeing Hannibal %0ariding up to the Colline Gate, could suggest the means of %0aaccomplishing. It was left for a fig, in the hand of Cato, to %0ashow how near was Carthage to the gates of Rome ! %0a%0aIn the Porum even, and in the very midst of the Comitium™ %0aof Rome, a fig-tree is carefully cultivated, in memory of the %0aconsecration which took place on the occasion of a thunder- %0abolt' which once fell on that spot ; and still more, as a me- %0amorial of the fig-tree which in former days overshadowed %0aRomulus and Remus, the founders of our empire, in the Lu- %0apercal Cave. This tree received the name of "ruminalis," %0afrom the circumstance that under it the wolf was found giving %0athe breast — rumis it was called in those days — to the two %0ainfants. A group in bronze was afterwards erected to con- %0asecrate the remembrance of this miraculous event, as, through %0athe agency of Attus Navius the augur, the tree itself had %0a%0aeluded both days in the computation ; the one they dated /rom, and the %0aday of, the event. %0a%0aIn sending for the fig, and thinking of this method of speaking to %0athe feelings of his fellow-countrymen. %0a%0aA place in the Forum, where pahlic meetings were held, and certain %0aoffences tried. %0a%0a" He alludes to the Puteal, or enclosed space in the Forum, consecrated %0aby Scribonius Libo, in consequence of the spot havin"' been struck by %0alightning. ° %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 21.] %0a%0a%0a%0aCAPEIFICATION. %0a%0a%0a%0a311 %0a%0a%0a%0apassed spontaneously from its original locality" to the Comi- %0atium m the Forum.

Another %0aone, accidentaUy planted there, flourished in the middle of the %0aForum,'" upon the very spot, too, in Avhich, when from a dire- %0aful presage it had been foreboded that the growing empire %0awas about to sink to its very foundations, Curtius, at the price %0aof an inestimable treasure— in other words, by the sacrifice of %0asuch unbounded virtue and piety— redeemed his country by a %0aglorious death. By a like accident, too, a vine and an olive- %0atree have sprung up in the same spot,'« which have ever since %0abeen carefully tended by the populace for the agreeable shade %0awhich they afford. The altar that once stood there was after- %0awards removed by order of the deified Julius Csesar, upon the %0aoccasion of the last spectacle of gladiatorial combats" which %0ahe gave in the Forum. %0a%0aCHAP. 21. — CAPEIFICATION. %0a%0aThe fig, the only one among all the pomes, hastens to maturity %0aby the aid of a remarkable provision of Nature. (19.) The %0awild-fig, known by the name of " caprificus," never ripens %0aitself, though it is able to impart to the others the principle %0aof which it is thus destitute ; for we occasionally find Nature %0amaking a transfer of what are primary causes, and being gene- %0arated from decay. To effect this purpose the wild fig-tree %0a%0a" On the banks of the Tiber, below the Palatine Mount. The whole %0aof this passage is in a most corrupt siate, and it is difficult to extract a %0amoaning from it. %0a%0a'3 By slips from the old tree, as Tacitus seems to say — " in novos foetus %0arevivisceret." %0a%0aAt the foot of the Qapitoline Hill. %0a%0aProbably near where the Curtius Lacus had stood in the early days of %0aEorae. The story of Metius Curtius, who leaped into the yawning gulph %0ain the Forum, in order to save his country, is known to every classical %0areader. %0a%0a"« The Forum.

It does bear fruit, though small, and %0adisagreeable to the taste. %0a%0a%0a%0a3)2 %0a%0a%0a%0aPLINT'S NATUEAL niSTORT. %0a%0a%0a%0a[Book XV. %0a%0a%0a%0aproduces a kind of gnat." These insects, deprived of all sus- %0atenance from their parent tree, at the moment that it is has- %0atening to rottenness and decay, wing their flight to others of %0akindred though cultivated kind. There feeding with avidity %0aupon the fig, they penetrate it in numerous places, and by %0athus making their way to the inside, open the pores of the %0afruit. The moment they effect their entrance, the heat of %0athe sun finds admission too, and through the inlets thus made %0athe fecundating air is introduced. These insects speedily %0aconsume the milky juice that constitutes the chief support %0aof the fruit in its infant®' state, a result which would other- %0awise be spontaneously effected by absorption : and hence it is %0athat in the plantations of figs a wild fig is usually allowed to %0agrow, being placed to the windward of the other trees in %0aorder that the breezes may bear from it upon them. Improving %0aupon this discovery, branches of the wild fig are sometimes %0abrought from a distance, and bundles tied together are placed %0aupon the cultivated tree. This method, however, is not neces- %0asary when the trees are growing on a thin soil, or on a site %0aexposed to the north-east wind ; for in these cases the figs will %0adry spontaneously, and the clefts which are made in the fruit %0aeffect the same ripening process which in other instances is %0abrought about by the agency of these insects. Nor is it requisite %0ato adopt this plan on spots which are liable to dust, such, for %0ainstance, as is generally the case with fig-trees planted by the %0aside of much-frequented roads : the dust having the property %0aof drying up®^ the juices of the fig, and so absorbing the %0amilky humours. There is this superiority, however, in an ad- %0avantageous site over the methods of ripening by the agency of %0adust or by caprification, that the fruit is not so apt to fall ; for %0athe secretion of the juices being thus prevented, the fig is not %0aso heavy as it would otherwise be, and the branches are less %0abrittle. %0a%0aAll figs are soft to the touch, and when ripe contain grains*' %0a%0a" This insect is one of the Hymenoptera ; the Cynips Psenes of Linnisus %0aand Fabricius. There is another insect of the same genus, but not so %0awell known. %0a%0aF6e observes that the caprification accelerates the ripeness of the %0afruit, but at the expense of the flavour. For the same purpose the upper %0apart of the fig is often pricked with a pointed quill. %0a%0a"1 " Infantiam pomi " — literally, " the infancy of the fruit." %0a%0a^- Fee denies the truth of this assertion. ss Frumenta. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 21.] %0a%0a%0a%0acaphification. %0a%0a%0a%0a313 %0a%0a%0a%0ain the interior. The juice, when the fruit is ripening, has the %0ataste of milk, and when dead ripe, that of honey. If left on %0athe tree they will gi-ow old ; and when in that state, they %0adistil a liquid that flows in tears ^ like gum. Those that are %0amore highly esteemed are kept for drying, and the most ap- %0aproved kinds are put away for keeping in baskets.^^ The figs %0aof the island of Ebusus ^ arc the best as well as the largest, %0aand next to them are those of Marrucinum.^^ Where figs are %0ain great abundance, as in Asia, for instance, huge jars«^ %0aarc tilled with them, and at Kuspina, a city of Africa, we find %0acasks used for a similar purpose : here, in a dry state, they %0aare extensively used instead of bread,'^ and indeed as a general %0aarticle of pro^dsion.^i Cato,^^ ^j^^^j-^ laying down certain defi- %0anite regulations for the support of labourers employed in agri- %0aculture, recommends that their supply of food should be %0alessened just at the time when the fig is ripening : it has %0abeen a plan adopted in more recent times, to find a substitute %0afor salt with cheese, by eating fresh figs. To this class of %0afruit belong, as we have already mentioned,^* the cottana and %0athe carica, together with the cavnea,^^ which was productive of %0aso bad an omen to M.

This nut, taken as a whole, is very considerably %0asmaller than the pine nut, but the kernel is larger in propor- %0ation. Nature, too, has conferred upon it a peculiar honour, in %0aprotecting it with a two-fold covering, the first of which forms %0aa hollowed cushion for it to rest upon, and the second is a %0awoody shell. It is for this reason that this fruit has been %0alooked upon as a symbol consecrated to marriage,'* its off- %0aspring being thus protected in such manifold ways : an expla- %0anation which bears a much greater air of probability than that %0awhich would derive it from the rattling which it makes when %0ait bounds from the floor. The Greek names that have been %0agiven to this fruit fully prove that it, like many others, has %0abeen originally introduced from Persis ; the best kinds being %0aknown in that language by the names of " Persicum,'"'' and %0a" basilicon these, in fact, being the names by which they %0a%0aSprengel to be identical -with the Crataegus azarolus of Linnaeus.

When old, %0athe nut becomes more oleaginous. The only difference in the %0aseveral varieties consists in the relative hardness or brittleness %0aof the shell, it being thin or thick, full of compartments or %0asmooth and uniform. This is the only fruit that Nature has %0aenclosed in a covering formed of pieces soldered together ; the %0ashell, in fact, forming a couple of boats, while the kernel is %0adivided into four separate compartments-^ by the intervention %0aof a ligneous membrane. %0a%0aIn all the other kinds, the fruit and the shell respectively %0aare of one solid piece, as we find the case with the hazel-nut,^ %0aand another variety of the nut formerly known as " Abcl- %0alina," from the name*" of the district in which it was first %0aproduced : it was first introduced into Asia and Greece from %0aPontus, whence the name that is sometimes given to it — the %0a"Pontic nut."

It is a %0amatter of doubt whether this tree was in existence in Italy in %0athe time of Cato ; we fiind him speaking of Greek nuts,^" but %0athere are some persons who think that these belong to the %0awalnut class.

There is the almond known as %0athe " moUusca," also, which breaks the shell of itself.

The %0achesnut has its armour of defence in a shell bristling with %0aprickles like the hedge-hog, an envelope which in the acorn %0ais only partially developed. It is really surprising, however, %0athat Nature should have taken such pains thus to conceal an %0aobject of so little value. "We sometimes find as many as %0athree nuts beneath a single outer shell. The skin^^ of the nut %0ais limp and flexible : there is a membrane, too, which lies %0anext to the body of the fruit, and which, both in this and in %0athe walnut, spoils the flavour if not taken off. Chesnuts are %0athe most pleasant eating when roasted they are sometimes %0aground also, and are eaten by women when fasting for reli- %0agious scruples,''^ as bearing some resemblance to bread. It is %0afrom Sardes" that the chesnut was first introduced, and hence %0ait is that the Greeks have given it the name of the " Sardian %0aacorn;" for the name "Dies balanon" was given at a later %0aperiod, after it had been considerably improved by cultivation. %0a%0aAt the present day there are numerous varieties of the %0achesnut. Those of Tarentum are a light food, and by no %0ameans difficult of digestion ; they are of a flat shape. There %0ais a rounder variety, known as the "balanitis;"*^ it is very %0aeasily peeled, and springs clean out of the shell, so to say, of %0a%0a3" In c. xxi. of this Book. %0a%0aThe tree is the Fagus castanea of Linnaeds. *i Cortex. %0a%0aThe common mode of eating it at the present day.

Tarentum and Neapolis in Cam- %0apania are the most esteemed localities for the chesnut : other %0akinds, again, are grown to feed pigs upon,^^ the skin of which %0ais rough and folded inwards, so as to penetrate to the heart of %0athe kernel. %0a%0aCHAP. 26.

THE FETJIT OF THE AKBTTTTJS. %0a%0aThe flesh of the ground-strawberry"* is very different to %0athat of the arbute-tree,^ which is of a kindred kind : indeed, %0athis is the only instance in which we find a similar fruit grow- %0aing upon a tree and on the ground. The tree is tufted and %0abushy ; the fruit takes a year to ripen, the blossoms of the %0ayoung fruit flowering whUe that of the preceding year is %0aarriving at maturity. Whether it is the male tree or the %0afemale that is unproductive, authors are not generally agreed. %0a%0aThis is a fruit held in no esteem, in proof of which it has %0a%0awords to denote the difference between " acinus" and " bacca." Tbe lat- %0ater is properly the " berry ;" the grape being the type of the " acinus." %0a%0a59 See B. xvi. c. 41. The mulberry is the Morus nigra of modern %0anaturalists. It is generally thought that this was the only variety known %0ato the ancients ; but Fee queries, from the story of Pyramus and Thisbc, %0awhich represents the mulberry as changing from white to blood colour, %0athat the white mulberry was not unknown to them ; but through some %0acause, now unknown, was gradually lost sight of. %0a%0afi" This is still the case with the mulberry. %0a%0a61 See B. xvi. c. 71, andB. xxiv. c. 73.

It has also %0awith us another name besides that of "unedo," being known %0aalso as the " arbutus." Juba states that in Arabia this tree %0aattains the height of fifty cubits. %0a%0aCnAP. 29. THE RELATIVE NATTJIiES OF BEKKY FRUITS. %0a%0aThere is a great difference also among the various acinus %0afruits. First of all, among the grapes, we find considerable %0adifference in respect to their firmness, the thinness or thick- %0aness of the skin, and the stone inside the fruit, which in some %0avarieties is remarkably small, and in others even double in %0anumber : these last producing but very little juice. Very dif- %0aferent, again, are the berries of the ivy"' and the elder as %0aalso those in the pomegranate,*^ these being the only ones that %0aare of an angular shape. These last, also, have not a mem- %0abrane for each individual grain, but one to cover them all iu %0acommon, and of a pale colour. All these fruits consist, too, %0aof juice and flesh, and those more particularly which have but %0asmall seeds inside. %0a%0aThere are great varieties, too, among the berry™ fruits; %0athe berry of the olive being quite different from that of the %0alaurel, the berry of the lotus'' from that of the cornel, and %0athat of the mj'rtle from the berry of the lentisk. Tlie berry, %0ahowever, of the aquifolium"- and the thoru'^ is quite destitute %0aof juice. %0a%0aThe cherry occupies a middle place between the berry and %0athe acinus fruit : it is white at first, wliicli is the case also %0a%0aHe siij^gcsts that it is so called from " uimm edo," " I eat but one ;" %0aa rather fanciful etymology, it would seem. %0a%0aThis supposition is uot warranted, from merely the fact of there being %0atwo names.

From white, some of the berries %0apass to green, the olive and the laurel, for instance ; while iii %0athe mulberry, the cherry, and the cornel, the change is to red ; %0aand tlien in some to black, as with the mulberry, the cherry, %0aand the olive, for instance. %0a%0aCHAP. 30. (25.) — NINE VAKIETIES OF THE CHERRY. %0a%0aThe cherry did not exist in Italy before the period of the %0avictory gained over Mithridates by L. Lucullus, in the year %0aof the City 680. He was the first to introduce this tree from %0aPontus, and now, in the course of one hundred and twenty %0ayears, it has travelled beyond the Ocean, and arrived in Bri- %0atannia even. The cherry, as we have already stated," in spite %0aof every care, it has been found impossible to rear in Egypt. %0aOf this fruit, that known as the " Apronian" is the reddest %0avarietj', the Lutatian'' being the blackest, and the Ca;ciliau'" %0aperfectly round. The Junian" cherry has an agreeable flavour, %0abut onh*, so to saj^, when eaten beneath the tree, as they are %0aso remarkably delicate that they will not bear carrying. The %0ahigliest rank, however, has been awarded to the duracinus*" %0avariety, known in Campania as the " Plinian''®' cherry, and in %0alielgica to the Lusitanian"^- cherry, as also to one that grows %0aon the banks of the llhenus. This last kind has a third %0acolour, being a mixture*'* of black, red, and green, and has %0aalways the appearance of being just on the turn to ripening. %0aIt is less than five years since the kind known as the " laurel- %0acherry" was introduced, of a bitter but not unpleasant flavour, %0a%0a■'5 He must alhidc to what lie has stated in B. xii. c. 3, for he has no- %0awhere said that the cherry will not grow in Jtgypt.

Linnaeus %0aenumerates eleven principal flavours in the vegetable kingdora--dry or %0ainsipid, aqueous, viscous, salt, acrid, styptic, sweet, fat, bitter, acid, and %0anauseous ; these terms, however seem, some of them, to be very indefinite. %0a%0aT 2 %0a%0a%0a%0a324 %0a%0a%0a%0aPLIKY'S natural UISTOllT. %0a%0a%0a%0a[Book XV. %0a%0a%0a%0ain common to the fruits and the various juices : the sweet, the %0aluscious, the unctuous, the bitter, the rough, tlie acrid,*'* the %0apungent, the sharp, the sour, and the salt ; in addition to %0awhich, there are three otlier kinds of flavours of a nature that is %0atruly singular. The first of these last kiuds is tliat flavour in %0awhich several other flavours are united, as in wine, for in- %0astance ; for in it we are sensible of the rough, the pungent," %0aand the luscious, all at the same moment, and all of them %0aflavours that belong to other substances. The second of these %0aflavours is that in wliich we are sensible at the same instant %0aof a flavour that belongs to another substance, and yet of one %0athat is peculiar to the individual object of which we are tast- %0aing, such as that of milk, for instance : indeed, in milk we %0acannot correctly say that there is any pronounced flavour that %0ais either sweet, or unctuous, or luscious, a sort of smooth taste'^ %0ain the mouth being predominant, which holds the place of a %0amore decided flavour. The third instance is that of water, %0awhich has no flavour whatever, nor, indeed, any flavouring %0aprinciple but still, this very absence of flavour is considered %0aas constituting one of them, and forming a peculiar class'" of %0aitself ; so much so, indeed, that if in water any taste or flavour- %0aing principle is detected, it is looked upon as impure. %0a%0aIn the perception of all these various flavours the smell %0aplays a very considerable'''' part, there being a very great %0aaffinity between them. Water, however, is properly quite in- %0aodorous : and if the least smell' is to be perceived, it is not %0apure water. It is a singular thing that three of the principal %0aelements of Nature — water, air, and fire— should have neither %0ataste nor smell, nor, indeed, any flavouring principle whatever. %0a%0aIt requires considerable discernment to appropriate nicely its £no-lish %0asynonym to these four varieties of tastes, " acer, acutus, acerbus^and %0aacidus," more especially when we find that the "bitter" and the "rouo-L" %0aare occupied already by the " amarus " and the " austerus." ° %0aIn allusion, probably, to the pungency of the aroma or bouquet. %0a^* Lenitate. %0a%0aThis seems to be the meaning of " succus." %0a^ The " insipid." %0a%0a^' This is so much the case, that the most nauseous medicine mav he %0ataken almost with impunity— so far as taste is concerned — by tightly press- %0aing the nostrils while taking it. %0a%0a^5 Fee remarks that this is true of fire, and of distilled or perfectly pure %0awater ; but that physiologists are universally agreed that the air has iU %0aown peculiar smell. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 33 ] %0a%0a%0a%0aCOLOUll AND SM1;LI; OF JUICES. %0a%0a%0a%0a325 %0a%0a%0a%0aCHAP. 33. (28.) — THE colour and smrll of juices. %0a%0aAmong the juices, those of a vinous** flavour belong to the %0apeur, the mulberry, and the myrtle, and not to the grape, a %0avery singular fact. An unctuous taste is detected in the olive/ %0athe laurel, the walnut, and the almond ; sweetness exists in %0athe grape, the fig, and the date ; while in the plum class Ave %0afind a watery- juice. There is a considerable difference, too, %0ain the colours assumed by the various juices. That of the %0amulberry, the cherry, the cornel, and the black grape resem- %0ables the colour of blood, while in the white grape the juice is %0awhite. The humour found in the summit of the fig^ is of a %0amilky nature, but not so with the juice found in the body of %0athe fruit.

Some fruits grow in a pod which is %0asweet itself, and contains a bitter seed : whereas in most kinds %0aof fruit the seed is agreeable to the palate, those which grow %0ain a pod are condemned. Other fruits are berries, with the %0astone within and the flesh without, as in the olive and the %0acherry : others, again, have the berry within and the stone %0awithout, the case, as we have ab'eady stated, with the berries %0athat grow in Egypt. %0a%0aThose fruits, known as " pomes," have the same character- %0aistics as the berry fruits ; in some of them we find the body of %0athe fruit within and the shell without, as in the nut, for ex- %0aample ; others, again, have the meat of the fruit without and %0athe shell within, the peach and the plum, for instance : the %0arefuse part being thus surrounded with the flesh, while in %0aother fruits the flesh is surrounded by the refuse part." %0anuts are enclosed in a shell, chesnuts in a skin ; in chesnuts %0athe skin is taken off", but in medlars it is eaten with the rest. %0aAcorns are covered with a crust, grapes with a husk, and %0apomegranates with a skin and an inner membrane. The mul- %0aberry is composed of flesh and juice, while the cherry consists %0aof juice and skin. In some fruits the flesh separates easily %0afrom the woody part, the walnut and the date, for instance ; %0ain others it adheres, as in the case of the olive and the laurel %0aberry: some kinds, again, partake of both natures, the peach, %0afor example ; for in the duracinus''' kind the flesh adheres to %0athe stone, and cannot be torn away from it, while in the other %0a%0aThe reading here should he " acutissimus," prohahly, instead of %0a" acerrimus."

In some fruits there is no %0astone or shell'* either within or without, one variety of tlio %0adate,'* for instance. In some kinds, again, the shell is eaten, %0ajust the same as the fruit ; this we have already mentioned as %0abeing the case with a variety of the almond found in Egypt.''' %0aSome fruits have on the outside a twofold refuse covering, the %0achcsnut, the almond, and the walnut, for example. ISome, %0aagain, are composed of three separate parts — the body of the %0afruit, then a woody shell, and inside of that a kernel, as in the %0apeach. %0a%0aSome fruits grow closely packed together, such as grapes %0aand sorbs : these last, just like so many grapes in a cluster, %0acling round the branch and bend it downwards with their %0aweight. On the other hand, some fruits grow separately, at a %0adistance from one another; this is the case with the peacli. %0aSome fruits are enclosed in a sort of matrix, as with the grains %0aof the pomegranate : some hang down from a stalk, such as %0athe pear, for instance: others hang in clusters, grapes and %0adates, for example. Others, again, grow upon stalks and %0abunches united : this we find the case with the berries of the %0aivy and the elder. Some adhere close to the branches, like %0athe laurel berry, while other varieties lie close to the branch %0aor hang from it, as the case may be : thus we find in the olive %0asome fruit with short stalks, and others with long. Some fruits %0agrow with a little calyx at the top, the pomegranate, for ex- %0aample, the medlar, and the lotus"^ of Egypt and the Euphrates. %0a%0aThen, too, as to the various parts of fruit, they are held in %0adifferent degrees of esteem according to their respective re- %0acommendations. In the date it is the flesh that is usually %0aliked, in those of Thebais it is the crust;'" the grape and the %0acaryota date are esteemed for their juice, the pear and tl;e %0aapple for their firmness, the melimelum-'^ for its soft meat, %0a%0a" Lignum : literally, " wood."

The kind known as %0a" oxymyrsine,"" belongs only to the wild variety : ornamental %0agardeners classify several varieties of the cultivated kind ; the %0a" Tarentine,"^^ they speak of as a myrtle with a small leaf, %0athe myrtle of this country as having a broad leaf, and the %0ahexasticha*' as being very thickly covered with leaves, growing %0ain rows of six : it is not, however, made any use of. There %0aare two other kinds, that are branchy and well covered. In %0amy opinion, the conjugula is the same that is now called the %0aRoman myrtle. It is in Egypt that the myrtle is most %0aodoriferous. %0a%0aCato^® has taught us how to make a wine from the black %0amyrtle, by drying it thoroughly in the shade, and then putting %0ait in must : he says, also, that if the berries are not quite dry, %0ait will produce an oil. Since his time a method has been dis- %0acovered of making a pale wine from the white variety ; two %0asextarii of pounded myrtle are steeped in three semi-sextarii of %0awine, and the mixture is then subjected to pressure. %0a%0aThe leaves*^ also are dried by themselves till they are capa- %0able of being reduced to a powder, which is used for the treat- %0ament of sores on the human body : this powder is of a slightly %0acorrosive nature, and is employed also for the purpose of %0achecking the perspiration.

THE MYRTLE USED AT ROME IN OVATIONS. %0a%0aThe myrtle has played " its part, also, in the successes of %0awar. Posthumius Tubertus, who gained a victory over the %0aSabincs in his consulship,*^ was the first person who entered %0atlie City enjoying the honour of an ovation,^* for having %0aachieved this success with ease and without bloodshed : upon %0awhich occasion he made his entry crowned with the mjTtle of %0aVenus Victrix, and thereby rendered her tree an object of %0aregard" to our enemies -even. Ever since this occasion, the %0awreath of those who have enjoyed an ovation has been made %0aof myrtle, with the exception of M. Crassus,*** who, on his vic- %0atory over the fugitive slaves and Spartacus, made his entry %0acrowned with laurels. Massurius informs us, also, that some %0agenerals, on the occasion of a triumph even, have worn a %0awreath of myrtle in the triumphal car. Piso states that %0a%0aA new proof, as Fee remarks, that the ancients had peculiar notions %0aof their own, as to the flavour of wine ; myrtle berries, he says, would %0aimpart to wine a detestable aromatic flavour. %0a^' " Saccis :" the strainer being made of cloth.

Cato^^ speaks of two %0avarieties of this tree, the Delphic and the Cyprian. Pompeius %0aLenifius has added another, to which he has given the name of %0a" mustax," from the circumstance of its being used for putting %0aunder the cake known by the name of " mustaceum."" He %0asays that this variety has a very large leaf, flaccid, and of a %0awhitish hue ; that the Delphic laurel is of one uniform colour, %0agreener than the other, with berries of very large size, and of %0aa red tint approaching to green. He says, too, that it is with %0athis laurel that the victors at Delphi*'^ are crowned, and warriors %0awho enjoy the honours of a triumph at Eome. The Cyprian %0alaurel, he says, has a short leaf, is of a blackish colour, with %0aan imbricated^'' edge, and crisped. %0a%0a59 The Senate refused him a triumph ; and he accordingly celebrated %0aone on the Alban Mount, j^.c. 231.

There is the tinus^' for instance, by some con- %0asidered as a species of wild laurel, while others, again, regard %0ait as a tree of a separate class ; indeed, it does differ from tho %0alaurel as to the colour, the berry being of an azure blue. The %0aroyal'** laurel, too, has since been added, which has of latj %0al)egun to be known as the " Augustan : " both the tree, as %0aAvell as the leaf, are of remarkable size, and the berries have %0anot the usual rough taste. Some say, however, that the royal %0alaurel and the Augustan are not the same tree, and make out %0athe former to be a peculiar kind, with a leaf both longer and %0abroader than that of the Augustan. The same authors, also, %0amake a peculiar species of the bacalia the commonest laurel %0aof all, and the one that bears the greatest number of berries. %0a"With them, too, the barren laurcP^ is the laurel of the tri- %0aumphs, and they say that this is the one that is used by war- %0ariors when enjoying a triumph — a thing that surprises me %0avery much ; unless, indeed, the use of it was first introduced %0aby the late Emperor Augustus, and it is to be considered as %0athe progeny of that laurel, which, as we shall just now have %0aoccasion to mention, was sent to him from heaven ; it being the %0asmallest of them all, with a crisped ™ short leaf, and very rarely %0ato be met with. %0a%0aIn ornamental gardening we also find the taxa"' employed, %0awith a small leaf sprouting from the middle of the leaf, and %0aforming a fringe, as it were, hanging from it ; the spadonia,'- %0atoo, without this fringe, a tree that thrives remarkably well %0ain the shade : indeed, however dense the shade may be, it will %0asoon cover the spot with its shoots. There is the chama)- %0adaphne," also, a shrub that grows wild ; the Alexandrian'^ %0a%0aOr tine tree, the Viburnum tinus of Linnaeus, one of the caprifolia. %0aIt is not reckoned as one of the laurels, though it has many of the same %0a%0aC'llUTtlC tens tics I'^G^H. %0a%0a63 The biirren laurel of the triumphs was the Laurus nohilis of Linnaeus, %0awhich has oiilv male flowers. . . %0a%0aThe Laurus vul%3ci-aris folio undulato of the Parisian Eorttts, J?ee says. %0aNot a laurel, no'^- yet a dicotyledon, Fee says, but one of the Aspa- %0aragca, probably the Ruscus hypoglossum of Linnaeus, sometimes known, %0ahowever, as tlie Ali'xandrian laurel. „ , , i^-i- %0a%0a« Or " eunuch" laurel ; a variety, probably, of the Laurus nobilis. %0a73 The " ground laurel :" according to Sprengel, tins is the Kuscusrace- %0aniosus of Linnaeus.

From the root it throws out %0abranches threB quarters of a foot in length ; it is much used %0ain ornamental gardening, and for making wreaths, and it has %0aa more pointed leaf than that of the myrtle, and superior to it %0ain softness, whiteness, and size : the seed, which lies between %0athe leaves, is red. This last kind grows in great abundance %0aon Mount Ida and in the vicinity of Heraclea in Pontus : it is %0aonly found, however, in mountainous districts. %0a%0aThe laurel, too, known as the daphnoides,'^ is a variety that %0ahas received many different names : by some it is called tlie %0aPelasgian laurel, by others the euthalon, and by others the %0astephanon Alexandri.'' This is also a branchy shrub, with a %0athicker and softer leaf than that of the ordinary laurel: if %0atasted, it leaves a burning sensation in the mouth and throat : %0athe hemes are red, inclining to black. The ancient writers %0ahave remarked, that in their time there was no species of %0alaurel in the island of Corsica.

Another reason, too, may be the fact, that of all %0athe shrubs that are planted and received in our houses, this is %0athe only one that is never struck by lightning.^ It is for %0athese reasons, in my opinion, that the post of honour lias been %0aawarded to the laurel more particularly in triumphs, and not, %0aas Massurius says, because it was used for the purposes of %0afumigation and purification from the blood of the enemy. %0a%0aIn addition to the above particulars, it is not permitted to %0adefile the laurel and the olive by applying them to profane %0auses; so much so, indeed, that, not even for the propitiation of %0athe divinities, should a fire be lighted with them at either %0aaltar or shrine.^ Indeed, it is very evident that the laurel pro- %0atests against such usage by crackling*' as it does in the fire, %0athus, in a manner, giving expresssion to its abhorrence of such %0atreatment. The wood of this tree when eaten is good as a %0aspecific for internal maladies and affections of the sinews.** %0a%0aIt is said that when it thundered, the Emperor Tiberius was %0a%0a*■* L.

The aruspices gave orders that %0athe hen and her progeny should be carefully preserved, and %0athe branch planted and tended with religious care. This was %0aaccordingly done at the country-house belonging to the Cajsars, %0aon the Flaminian Way, near the banks of the Tiber, eight %0amiles from the City ; from which circumstance that road has %0asince received the title "Ad gallinas." From the branch %0athere has now arisen, wondrous to relate, quite a grove : and %0aAugustus Caisar afterwards, when celebrating a triumph, held %0aa branch of it in his hand and wore a wreath of this laurel on %0ahis head ; since which time all the succeeding emperors have %0afollowed his example. Hence, too, has originated the custom of %0aplanting the branches which they have held on these occasions, %0aand we thus see groves of laurel still existing which owe their %0arespective names to this circumstance. It was on the above %0aoccasion, too, that not improbably a change was effected in %0athe usual laurel of the triumph."^ The laurel is the only one %0aamong the trees that in the Latin language has given an %0aappellation to a man,^^ and it is the only one the leaf of which %0ahas a distinct name of its own, — it being known by the name %0aof " laurea."

HOW LONG IT EXISTED ONLY IN GREKX'K. %0a%3c %0a%3c AT WHAT PERIOD IT WAS EIKST INTfiODUCED INTO ITALY, SPAIN, %0a%3c AND AFRICA. %0a%3c %0a%3c Theophrastcs,^ one of the most famous among the Gret-k %0a%3c writers, who flourished about the year 440 of the City oi %0a%3c Rome, has asserted that the olive'* does not grow at a distance %0a%3c of more than forty ^ miles from the sea. Fenestclla tells us %0a%3c that in the year of Rome 173, being the reign of Tarquinius %0a%3c Priscus, it did not exist in Italy, Spain, or Africa;^ whereas %0a%3c at the present day it has crossed the Alps even, and has been %0a%3c introduced into the two provinces of Gaul and the middle of %0a%3c Spain. In the year of Rome 505, Appius Claudius, grandson %0a%3c of Appius Claudius Caecus, and L. Junius being consuls, twelve %0a%3c pounds of oil sold for an as ; and at a later period, in the year %0a%3c G80, M. Seius, son of Lucius, the curule cedile, regulated the %0a%3c price of olive oil at Rome, at the rate of ten pounds for the as, %0a%3c for the whole year. A person will be the less surprised at %0a%3c this, when he learns that twenty-two years after, in the third %0a%3c consulship of Cn. Pompcius, Italy was able to export olive oil %0a%3c to the provinces. , , %0a%3c %0a%3c Hesiod,^ who looked upon an acquaintance with agriculture %0a%3c %0a%3c 1 Hist.

THE NATURE OF THE OLIVE, AND OF NEW OLIVE OIL. %0a%3c %0a%3c Fabianus maintains that the olive will grow' neither in %0a%3c very cold climates, nor yet in very hot ones. VirgiP has %0a%3c mentioned three varieties of the olive, the orchites,' the %0a%3c radius,^ and the posia;' and says that they require no rakiug %0a%3c or pinning, nor, in fact, any attention whatever. There is no %0a%3c doubt that in the case of these plants, soil and climate are the %0a%3c things of primary importance ; but still, it is usual to prune %0a%3c them at the same time as the vine, and they are improved by %0a%3c lopping between them every here and there. The gathering of %0a%3c the olive follows that of the grape, and there is even a greater %0a%3c degree of skill required in preparing'" oil than in making %0a%3c Avine ; for the very same olives will frequently give quite %0a%3c different results. The first oil of all, produced from the raw " %0a%3c olive before it has begun to ripen, is considered preferable %0a%3c to all the others in flavour ; in this kind, too, the first drop- %0a%3c pings of the press are the most esteemed, diminishing gradually %0a%3c in goodness and value ; and this, whether the wicker-work %0a%3c basket is used in making it, or whether, following the more %0a%3c %0a%3c •'' This is the case. We may remark that the tree will grow in this %0a%3c country, but the fruit never comes to maturity. %0a%3c %0a%3c « Georg. ii. 85, also ii. 420. %0a%3c Probably the Olea maximo fnictu of Toumefort. It has its name %0a%3c from the Greek opx'C, the " testis," a name by which it is still known in %0a%3c some parts of Provence. %0a%3c %0a%3c * Or "shuttle" olive. Probably the modern pickoline, or long olive. %0a%3c %0a%3c 9 Probably the Olea media rotunda praecox of Toumefort. It is %0a%3c slightly bitter. %0a%3c %0a%3c 'f' This is so much the case, that though the olives of Spain and Por- %0a%3c tugal are among the finest, their oils are of the very worst quality. %0a%3c %0a%3c It does not appear that the method of preparing oil by the use of %0a%3c boiling water was known to the ancients. Unripe olives produce an ex- %0a%3c cellent oil, but in very small quantities. Hence they are rarely used for %0a%3c the purpose. %0a%3c %0a%3c 12 Called "virgin," or "native" oil in France, and very highly esteemed. %0a%3c Sporta. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c C1..I,. 3.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c OLIVK OIL. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c recent plan, the pulp is put in a stick strainer, with narro-.v %0a%3c spikes and interstices.'* The riper the berry, the more unctu- %0a%3c ous the juice, and the less agreeable the taste.''

In this state it is called " druppa" by us, by the %0a%3c Greeks, " drypetis." %0a%3c %0a%3c In addition to these distinctions, it is of importance to %0a%3c observe whether the berry ripens in the press or while on fhe %0a%3c branch ; whether the tree has been watered, or whether the %0a%3c fruit has been nurtured solely by its own juices, and has %0a%3c imbibed nothing else but the dews of heaven. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 3. (2.) OLIVE OIL : THE COUNTBIES IN WHICH IT IS %0a%3c %0a%3c • PKODTTCED, AND ITS VAKIOUS ftTTALITIES. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is not with olive oil as it is with wine, for by age it ac- %0a%3c quires a bad flavour,'" and at the end of a year it is already %0a%3c old. This, if rightly understood, is a wise provision on the %0a%3c part of Nature: wine, which is only produced for the drunkard, %0a%3c she has seen no necessity for us to use when new ; indeed, %0a%3c by the fine flavour which it acquires with age, she rather %0a%3c in\dte3 us to keep it ; but, on the other hand, she has not wil.'ed %0a%3c that we should be thus sparing of oil, and so has reudered its %0a%3c use common and universal by the very necessity there is of using %0a%3c it while fresh. %0a%3c %0a%3c In the production of this blessing as Avell," Italy holds the %0a%3c highest rank among all countries,'® and more pailicuhu'ly the %0a%3c territory of Venafrum," that part of it in especial which %0a%3c produces the Licinian oil ; the qualities of which have confe rred %0a%3c upon the Licinian olive tho very highest renowu.

In addition to %0a%3c this, birds will never touch the berry of tlie Licinian olive. %0a%3c %0a%3c JText to Italy, the contest is maintained, and on very equal %0a%3c terms, between the territories of Istria and of Boetica. The %0a%3c next rank for excellence is claimed by the other provinces of %0a%3c our Empire, with the exception of Africa,-" the soil of which %0a%3c is better adapted for grain. That country Nature has given %0a%3c exclusively to the cereals ; of oil and wine she has all but %0a%3c deprived it, securing it a sufficient share of renown by its %0a%3c abundant harvests. As to the remaining particulars connected %0a%3c with the olive, they are replete with erroneous notions, and I %0a%3c shall have occasion to show that there is no part of our agri- %0a%3c cultural economy upon which people have been more gene- %0a%3c rally mistaken. %0a%3c %0a%3c (3.) The olive is composed of a stone, oil, flesh, and %0a%3c amurca the last being a bitter liquid, principally composed %0a%3c of water ; hence it is that in seasons of drought it is less plen- %0a%3c tiful, and more abundant when rains have prevailed. The %0a%3c oil is a juice peculiar to the olive, a fact more particularly %0a%3c stated in reference to its unripe state, as we have already %0a%3c mentioned when speaking of omphacium.^^ This oil continues %0a%3c on the increase up to the rising of Arcturus," or in other %0a%3c words, the sixteenth day before the calends of October ; " after %0a%3c which the increase is in the stone and the flesh. When drought %0a%3c has been followed by abundant rains, the oil is spoilt, and %0a%3c turns to amurca. It is the colour of this amurca that makes %0a%3c the olive turn black; hence, when the berry is just beginning %0a%3c to turn that colour, there is but little amurca in it, and before %0a%3c that period none at all. It is an error then, on the part of %0a%3c persons, to suppose that that is the commencement of maturity, %0a%3c %0a%3c =0 The heat of Africa is unfavourable to the olive. %0a%3c %0a%3c '^^ The faeces, marc, or lees. This is a crude juice contained in the %0a%3c cellular tissue of the fruit, known as viridine or cJilorophylk. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is owing, P'ee says, to a sort of fermentation, which alters the %0a%3c tissue of the cells containing the oil, displaces the constituent elements, %0a%3c and forms others, such as mucus, sugar, acetic acid, ammoniac, &c. "When %0a%3c ripe, the olive contains four oils ; that of the skin, the flesh, the stone, %0a%3c and the kernel. %0a%3c %0a%3c In B. xii, c. 60. 2^ See B. xviii. c. 74. %0a%3c %0a%3c ^ 16th of September. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 4.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c FIFTEEN VAUIETIES OF OLTTEa. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 281 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c which IS in reality only the near approach of corruption. A %0a%3c second error, too, is the supposition lliat the oil increases pro- %0a%3c portionably to the flesh of the berry, it being the fact that the %0a%3c oil IS all the time undergoing a change into flesh, and the stono %0a%3c IS growing larger and larger within. It is for this reason %0a%3c more particularly, that care is taken to water the tree at this %0a%3c period ; the real result of all this care and attention, as well as %0a%3c of the fall of copious rains, being, that the oil in reality is %0a%3c absorbed as the berry increases in size, unless fine dry weather %0a%3c should happen to set in, which naturally tends to contract the %0a%3c volume of the fruit. According to Theophrastus.^" heat is the %0a%3c sole primary cause of the oleaginous principle ; for which reason %0a%3c it is, that in the presses,'^' and in the cellars even, great fii'es %0a%3c are lighted to improve the quality of the oil. %0a%3c %0a%3c A third error arises from misplaced economy : to spare the %0a%3c expense of gathering, people are in the habit of waiting till the %0a%3c berry falls from tlie tree. Others, again, who wish to follow a %0a%3c middle course in this respect, beat the fruit off with poles, and %0a%3c so inflict injury on the tree and ensure loss in the succeeding %0a%3c year ; indeed, there was a very ancient regulation in existence %0a%3c relative to the gathering of the olive — "Neither pull nor %0a%3c beat the olive-tree.-^" Those who would observe a still greater %0a%3c degree of precaution, strike the branches lightly with a reed on %0a%3c one side of thera ; but even then the tree is reduced to bearing %0a%3c fruit but once in two years,-' in consequence of the injury done %0a%3c to the buds. Not less injurious, however, are the results of %0a%3c waiting till the berries fall from the tree ; for, by remaining on %0a%3c it beyond the proper time, they deprive the crop that is coming %0a%3c on of its due share of nutriment, by occupying its place : a %0a%3c clear proof of which is, that if they are not gathered before the %0a%3c west winds prevail, they are found to have acquired renewed %0a%3c strength, and are all the later before they fall. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 4.

" Without the leave of the owner or the keeper." %0a%3c %0a%3c 29 It is found that the olive, after an abundant season, will not bear in %0a%3c the following year ; probably the result of exhaustion. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 282 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c pliny's nattjual niftTonY. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Dook XV. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c kno^n as the " posia,"^" the berry of which, owing to a vicious %0a%3c method of cultivation, and not any fault on tlio part of Na- %0a%3c ture, has the most flesh upon it. Next to this is the orchites, %0a%3c which contains the greatest quantity of oil, and then, after %0a%3c that, the radius. As these are of a peculiarly delicate nature, %0a%3c the heat very rapidly takes effect upon them, and the amurca %0a%3c they contain causes them to fall. On the other hand, the %0a%3c gathering of the tough, hard-skinned olive is put off so late as %0a%3c the month of March, it being well able to resist the effects of %0a%3c moisture, and, consequently, very small. Those varieties known %0a%3c as the Licinian, the Cominian, the Contian, and the Sergian, %0a%3c by the Sabines called the "royal"'' olive, do not turn black %0a%3c before the west winds prevail, or, in other words, before the %0a%3c sixth day before'^ the ides of February. At this period it is %0a%3c generally thought that they begin to ripen, and as a most ex- %0a%3c cellent oil is extracted from them, experience would seem to %0a%3c give its support to a theory which, in reality, is altogether %0a%3c wrong. The growers say that in the same degree that cold %0a%3c diminishes the oil, the ripeness of the berry augments it; %0a%3c whereas, in reality, the goodness of the oil is owing, not to %0a%3c the period at which the olives are gathered, but to the natural %0a%3c properties of this peculiarvariety, in which the oil is remark- %0a%3c ably slow in turning to amurca. %0a%3c %0a%3c A similar error, too, is committed by those who keep the %0a%3c olives, when gathered, upon a layer of boards, and do not %0a%3c press the fruit till it has thrown out a sweat; it being the %0a%3c fact that every hour lost tends to diminish the oil and increase %0a%3c the amurca : the consequence is, that, according to the ordi- %0a%3c nary computation, a modius of olives yields no more than six %0a%3c pounds of oil. No one, however, ever takes account of the %0a%3c quantity of amurca to ascertain, in reference to the same %0a%3c kind of berry, to Avhat extent it increases daily in amount. %0a%3c Then, again, it is a very general error'^ among practical per- %0a%3c sons to suppose that the oil increases proportion ably to the %0a%3c increased size of the berry ; and more particularly so when it %0a%3c is so clearly proved that such is not the case, with reference to %0a%3c %0a%3c ^ More commonly spelt " pausia." %0a%3c %0a%3c "Regia."

THE METHOD OF MAKING OLIVE OIL. %0a%3c %0a%3c We will now proceed to mention the precepts given by Cato^* %0a%3c in relation to this subject. Upon a warm, rich"*' soil, he %0a%3c recommends us to sow the greater radius, the Salentina, the %0a%3c orchitcs, the posia, the Sergian, the Cominian, and the albi- %0a%3c cera;*" but with a remarkable degree of prudence he adds, %0a%3c that those varieties ought to be planted in preference which %0a%3c are considered to thrive best in the neighbouring localities. In %0a%3c a cold*' and meagre soil he says that the Licinian olive should %0a%3c be planted ; and he informs us tliat a rich or hot soil has the %0a%3c effect, in this last varietj-, of spoiling the oil, while the tree %0a%3c becomes exhausted by its own fertility, and is liable to be %0a%3c attacked by a sort of red moss.** He states it as his opinion %0a%3c that the olive grounds oiight to have a western aspect, and, %0a%3c indeed, he approves of no other. %0a%3c %0a%3c (6.) According to him, the best method of preserving olives %0a%3c is to put the orchitcs and the posia, while green, in a strong %0a%3c brine, or else to bruise them first, and preserve them in niastich %0a%3c oil."^ The more bitter the olive, he says, the better the oil ; %0a%3c but they should be gathered from the ground the verj- moment %0a%3c they fall, and washed if they are dirty. He says that three %0a%3c days will be quite sufficient for drying them, and that if it %0a%3c is frosty weather, they should be pressed on the fourth, care %0a%3c being taken to sprinkle them with salt. Olives, he informs %0a%3c irs,*' lose oil by being kept in a boarded store-room, and dete- %0a%3c riorate in quality ; the same being the case, too, if the oil is %0a%3c %0a%3c Or " oleaster."

All %0a%3c these operations, however, should be carried on with presses %0a%3c heated and tightly closed," and exposed to the air as little as %0a%3c possible — for which reason he recommends that wood sliould %0a%3c never be cut there, the most convenient fuel for the hres being %0a%3c the stones of the berries.

A third pil is that %0a%3c made of the fruit of the cicus,"' a tree which grows in Egypt %0a%3c in great abundance ; by some it is known as croton, by others %0a%3c as sili, and by others, again, as wild sesamuin : it is not so very %0a%3c long since this tree was first introduced here. In Spain, too, %0a%3c it shoots up with great rapidity to the size of the olive-tree, %0a%3c having a stem like that of the ferula, the leaf of the \ine, %0a%3c and a seed that bears a resemblance to a small ])ale grape. %0a%3c Our people are in the habit of calling it " riciniis,"" from the %0a%3c rcsembbiuce of the seed to that insect. It is boiled in water," %0a%3c and the oil that swims on the surface is then skimmed off : %0a%3c but in Egypt, where it grows in a greater abundance, the oil is %0a%3c extracted without employing either fire or water for the ])ur- %0a%3c ])0se, the seed being first sprinkled with salt, and then sub- %0a%3c jected to pressure : eaten with food this oil is repulsive, but it %0a%3c is very useful for burning in lamps. %0a%3c %0a%3c Amygdalinum, by some persons known as " metopium,"^ %0a%3c %0a%3c 8' It may be remarked, that in this Chapter Pliny totally confounds %0a%3c fixed oils, Volatile oils, and medicinal oils.

In making gleu- %0a%3c cinum,*^ must is boiled with olive-oil at a slow heat ; some %0a%3c persons, however, do not employ fire in making it, but leave a %0a%3c vessel, filled with oil and must, surrounded with grape husks, %0a%3c for two and twenty days, taking care to stir it twice a day : %0a%3c by the end of that period the whole of the must is imbibed %0a%3c by the oil. Some persons mix with this not only sampsu- %0a%3c chum, but perfumes of still greater price : that, too, which is %0a%3c used in the gjTnnasia is scented with perfumes as well, but %0a%3c those of the very lowest quality.

The largest fruit, and, indeed, the one that hangs at %0a%3c the greatest height, is the pine-nut. It contains within a %0a%3c number of small kernels, enclosed in arched beds, and covered %0a%3c with a coat of their own of rusty iron-colour ; Nature thus mani- %0a%3c festing a marvellous degree of care in providing its seeds with %0a%3c a soft receptacle. Another variety of this nut is the teren- %0a%3c tina,'* the shell of which may be broken with the fingers ; and %0a%3c hence it becomes a prey to the birds while still on the tree. A %0a%3c third, again, is known as the " sappinia,''-'" being the produce %0a%3c of the cultivated pitch-tree : the kernels are enclosed in a %0a%3c skin more than a shell, which is so remarkably soft that it is %0a%3c eatien together with the fruit. A fourth variety is that known %0a%3c as the " pityis ; " it is the produce of the pinaster,^" and is %0a%3c remarkable as a good specific for coughs. The kernels are %0a%3c sometimes boiled in honey among the Taurini, who then call %0a%3c them " aquiceli."

The chrysomelum ^* is %0a%3c marked with indentations down it, and has a colour inclining %0a%3c to gold ; the one that is known as the " Italian" quince, is of a %0a%3c paler complexion, and has a most exquisite smell : the quinces %0a%3c of Neapolis, too, are held in high esteem. The smaller varie- %0a%3c ties of the quince which are known as the " struthea,"^^ have %0a%3c a more pungent smell, but ripen later than the others ; that %0a%3c called the " musteum,"'-^ ripens the soonest of all. The coto- %0a%3c neum engrafted" on the strutheum, has produced a peculiar %0a%3c variety, known as the " Mulvianum," the only one of them %0a%3c all that is eaten raw.-^ At the j^resent day all these varieties %0a%3c are kept shut up in the antechambers of great men,^* where they %0a%3c receive the visits of their courtiers ; they are hung, too, upon %0a%3c the statues that pass the night Avith us in our chambers. %0a%3c %0a%3c There is a small wild^' quince also, the smell of which, next %0a%3c to that of the strutheum, is the most powerful ; it grows in %0a%3c the hedges. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 11. — SIX VARIETIES OF THE PEACH. %0a%3c %0a%3c Under the head of apples,^- we include a variety of fruits, %0a%3c although of an entirely different nature, such as the Persian %0a%3c apple, for instance, and the pomegranate, of which, when %0a%3c speaking of the tree, we have already enumerated^* nine va- %0a%3c rieties.

It is only within the last thirty %0a%3c years that these last have been introduced; originally they %0a%3c were sold at the price of a denarius a piece. Those known as %0a%3c the " supernatia"^* come from the country of the Sabines, but %0a%3c the "popularia" grow everywhere. This is a very harmless %0a%3c fruit, and a particular favourite with invalids : some, in fact, %0a%3c have sold before this as high as thirty sesterces apiece, a price %0a%3c that has never been exceeded by any other fruit. This, too, is %0a%3c the more to be wondered at, as there is none that is a worse %0a%3c keeper : for, when it is once plucked, the longest time that it %0a%3c will keep is a couple of days ; and so sold it must be, fetch %0a%3c what it may. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 12.

The plum-tree %0a%3c grafted on the nut exhibits what we may caU a piece of impu- %0a%3c dence quite its own, for it produces a fruit that has all the ap- %0a%3c pearance of the parent stock, together with the juice of the %0a%3c adopted fruit : in consequence of its being thus compounded of %0a%3c both, it is known by the name of " nuci-pruna." Nut-prunes, %0a%3c as well as the peach, the wild plum,*' and the cerina, are often %0a%3c put in casks, and so kept tiU the crop comes of the following %0a%3c year. All the other varieties ripen with the greatest rapidity, %0a%3c and pass off just as quickly. Move recently, in lia^tica, they have %0a%3c begun to introduce what they call "malina," or the fruit of %0a%3c the plum engrafted on the apple-tree,*^ and " amygdalina," the %0a%3c fruit of the plum engrafted on the almond-trge,*^ the kernel %0a%3c found in the stone of these last being that of the almond f° in- %0a%3c deed, there is no specimen in which two fruits have been more %0a%3c ingeniously combined in one. %0a%3c %0a%3c Among the foreign trees we have already spoken^' of the %0a%3c Damascene" plum, so called from Damascus, in Syria, but %0a%3c introduced long since into Italy ; though the stone of this plum %0a%3c is larger than usual, and the flesh smaller in quantity.

THE PEACH. %0a%3c %0a%3c The name of " Persica," or " Persian apple," given to this %0a%3c fruit, fully proves that it is an exotic in both Greece as well %0a%3c as Asia,*^ and that it was first introduced from Persis. As to %0a%3c the wild plum, it is a well-known fact that it will grow any- %0a%3c where ; and I am, therefore, the more surprised that no men- %0a%3c tion has been made of it by Cato, more particularly as he has %0a%3c pointed out the method of preserving several of the wild %0a%3c fruits as well. As to the peach-tree, it has been only intro- %0a%3c duced of late ygars, and with considerable difficulty ; so much %0a%3c so, that it is perfectly barren in the Isle of llhodes, the first %0a%3c resting-place^ that it found after leaving Egypt. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is quite untrue that the peach which grows in Persia is %0a%3c poisonous, and produces dreadful tortures, or that the kings %0a%3c of that countr)^, from motives of revenge, had it transplanted %0a%3c in Egypt, where, through the nature of the soil, it lost all its %0a%3c evil properties — for we find that it is of the " persea"^^ that %0a%3c the more careful writers have stated all this,*'' a totally different %0a%3c tree, the fruit of which resembles the red myxa, and, indeed, %0a%3c cannot be successfully cultivated anywhere but in the East. %0a%3c The learned have also maintained that it was not introduced %0a%3c from Persis into Egypt with the view of inflicting punishment, %0a%3c but say that it was planted at Memphis by Perseus ; for %0a%3c which reason it was that Alexander gave orders that the vic- %0a%3c tors should be crowned with it in the games which he insti- %0a%3c tuted there in honour of his'* ancestor : indeed, this tree has %0a%3c always leaves and fruit upon it, growing immediately upon the %0a%3c others.

Let no one, %0a%3c however, imagine that this name was merely given in a spirit %0a%3c of flattery to an illustrious family, for there is an apple known %0a%3c as the Sceptian,™ which owes its name to the son of a freed- %0a%3c man, who was the first to introduce it : it is remarkable for %0a%3c the roundness of its shape.

The %0a%3c "orbiculatum,"8» again, is so called from its shape, which is %0a%3c exactly spherical — the circumstance of the Greeks having called %0a%3c it the "epiroticum" proves that it came originally from %0a%3c Epirus.

By this mode of treatment, he assures us, they will %0a%3c attain a larger size than they would if left to ripen on the tree. %0a%3c As for the other kinds of pomes, he says that they should be %0a%3c wrapped up separately in fig-leaves, the windfalls being care- %0a%3c fully excluded, and then stored in baskets of osier, or else %0a%3c covered over with potters' earth. %0a%3c %0a%3c Pears are kept in earthen vessels pitched inside ; when %0a%3c filled, the vessels are reversed and then buried in pits. The %0a%3c Tarentine pear, Varro says, is gathered very late, while the %0a%3c Anician keeps very well in raisin wine. Sorb apples, too, are %0a%3c similarly kept in holes in the ground, the vessel being turned %0a%3c upside down, and a layer of plaster placed on the lid: it should be %0a%3c buried two feet deep, in a sunny spot; sorbs^°are also hung, like, %0a%3c grapes, in the inside of large vessels, together with the branches. %0a%3c %0a%3c Some of the more recent authors are found to pay a more %0a%3c scrupulous degree of attention to these various particulars, and %0a%3c recommend that the gathering of grapes or pomes, which are %0a%3c intended for keeping, should take place while the moon is on %0a%3c the wane,^' after the third hour of the day, and while the %0a%3c weather is clear, or dry winds prevail. In a similar manner, %0a%3c the selection, they say, ought to be made from a dry spot, and %0a%3c the fruit should be plucked before it is fully ripe, a moment %0a%3c being chosen while the moon is below the horizon. Grapes, %0a%3c they say, should be selected that have a strong, hard mallet- %0a%3c stalk, and after the decayed berries have been carefully re- %0a%3c moved with a pair of scissors, they should be hung up inside of %0a%3c %0a%3c " As Fee remarks, the fruit, if treated thus, would soon lose all the %0a%3c properties for which it is valued. %0a%3c 2s De Re Rust.

The same method, they say, should be adopted %0a%3c for keeping sorb apples and pears, the stalks being carefully %0a%3c covered with pitch ; care should be taken, too, that the ves- %0a%3c sels are kept at a distance from water. %0a%3c %0a%3c There are some persons who adopt the following method for %0a%3c preserving grapes. They take them off together with the %0a%3c branch, and place them, while still upon it, in a layer of %0a%3c plaster,^- taking care to fasten either end of the branch in a %0a%3c bulb of squill.^^ Others, again, go so far as to place them %0a%3c within vessels containing wine, taking care, however, that the %0a%3c grapes, as they hang, do not touch it. Some persons put %0a%3c apples in plates of earth, and then leave them to float in wine, %0a%3c a method by which it is thought that a vinous flavour is im- %0a%3c parted to them : while some think it a better plan to preserve all %0a%3c these kinds of fruit in millet. Most people, however, content %0a%3c themselves with first digging a hole in the ground, a couple of %0a%3c feet in depth ; a layer of sand is then placed at the bottom, %0a%3c and the fruit is arranged upon it, and covered with an earthen %0a%3c lid, over which the earth is thrown. Some persons again even %0a%3c go so far as to give their grapes a coating of potters' chalk, and %0a%3c then hang them up when dried in the sun ; when required for %0a%3c use, the chalk is removed with water.^* Apples are also pre- %0a%3c served in a similar manner ; but with them wine is employed %0a%3c for getting off the chalk. Indeed, wc find a very similar plan %0a%3c pursued with apples of the finest quality ; they have a coating %0a%3c laid upon them of either plaster or wax ; but they are apt, if %0a%3c not quite ripe when this was done, by the increase in their %0a%3c size to break their casing."** When apples are thus prepared, %0a%3c they are always laid with the stalk downwards.^^ Some %0a%3c persons pluck the apple together with the branch, the ends of %0a%3c which they thrust into the pith of elder, and then bury it in %0a%3c %0a%3c 32 A method not milikcly to spoil the grape, from the difficulty of re- %0a%3c moving the coat thus given to it. %0a%3c %0a%3c 3» A verj' absurd notion, as Fee observes. To keep fruit in millet is %0a%3c also condemned. %0a%3c %0a%3c 3* Which, of course, must deteriorate the flavour of the grape. %0a%3c %0a%3c 31* It is doubtful if they will increase in size, -when once plucked. %0a%3c %0a%3c 3* The modern authorities recommend the precisely opposite plan. %0a%3c %0a%3c 35* As absurd as the use of the bulb of squill. %0a%3c %0a%3c TOL.

[Book XV. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c the way already pointed out.^" There are some who assign to %0a%3c each apple or pear its separate vessel of clay, and after care- %0a%3c fully pitching the cover, enclose it again in a larger vessel : %0a%3c occasionally, too, the fruit is placed on a layer of flocks of %0a%3c wool, or else in baskets,^'' with a lining of chaff and clay. %0a%3c Other persons follow a similar plan, but use earthen plates for %0a%3c the purpose ; while others, again, employ the same method, %0a%3c but dig a hole in the earth, and after placing a layer of sand, %0a%3c lay the fruit on top of it, and then cover the whole with dry %0a%3c earth. Persons, too, are sometimes known to give quinces a %0a%3c coating of Pontic^* wax, and then plunge them in honey. %0a%3c %0a%3c Columella^* informs us, that fruit is kept by being carefully %0a%3c put in earthen vessels, which then receive a coating of pitch, and %0a%3c are placed in wells or cisterns to sink to the bottom. The people %0a%3c of maritime Liguria, in the vicinity of the Alps, first dry their %0a%3c grapes in the sun,"*" and wrap them up in bundles of rushes, %0a%3c which are then covered with plaster. The Greeks follow a %0a%3c similar plan, but substitute for rushes the leaves of the plane- %0a%3c tree, or of the vine itself, or else of the fig, which they dry %0a%3c for a single day in the shade, and then place in a cask in %0a%3c alternate layers with husks" of grapes. It is by this method %0a%3c that they preserve the grapes of Cos and Berytus, which are %0a%3c inferior to none in sweetness. Some persons, when thus pre- %0a%3c paring them, plunge the grapes into He-ashes the moment they %0a%3c take them from the vine, and then dry them in the sun ; they %0a%3c then steep them in warm water, after which they put them to %0a%3c dry again in the sun : and last of all, as already mentioned, %0a%3c wrap them up in bundles formed of layers of leaves and grape %0a%3c husks. There are some who prefer keeping their grapes in %0a%3c sawdust,''^ or else in shavings of the fir-tree, poplar, and ash : %0a%3c while others think it the best plan to hang them up in the %0a%3c granary, at a careful distance from the apples, directly after the %0a%3c gathering, being under the impression that the very best cover- %0a%3c ing for them as they hang is the dust" that naturally arises %0a%3c %0a%3c 2^ In a pit two feet deep, &c.

TWENTY-NINE VAEIETIES OF THE FIG. %0a%3c %0a%3c Of all the remaining fruits that are included under the %0a%3c name of " pomes," the fig^* is the largest : some, indeed, equal %0a%3c the pear, even, in size. "We have already mentioned, while %0a%3c treating of the exotic fruits, the miraculous productions of %0a%3c Egypt and Cyprus*® in the way of figs. The fig of Mount %0a%3c Ida" is red, and the size of an olive, rounder however, and %0a%3c like a medlar in flavour; they give it the name of Alex- %0a%3c andrian in those parts. The stem is a cubit in thickness ; it is %0a%3c branchy, has a tough, pliant wood, is entirely destitute of all %0a%3c milky juice,''® and has a green bark, and leaves like those of the %0a%3c linden tree, but soft to the touch. Onesicritus states that in %0a%3c Hyrcauia the figs are much sweeter than with us, and that the %0a%3c trees are more prolific, seeing that a single tree will bear as %0a%3c much as two hundred and seventy modii"*^ of fruit. The fig %0a%3c has been introduced into Italy from other countries, Chalcis %0a%3c and Chios, for instance, the varieties being very numerous : %0a%3c there are those from Lydia also, Avhich are of a purple colour, %0a%3c and the kind known as the " mamillana,"^ which is very %0a%3c similar to the Lydian. The callistruthiae are very little supe- %0a%3c rior to the last in flavour ; they are the coldest by nature of %0a%3c all the figs. As to the African fig, by many people preferred %0a%3c to any other, it has been made the subject of very consider- %0a%3c able discussion, as it is a kind that has been introduced very %0a%3c recently into Africa, though it bears the name of that country. %0a%3c %0a%3c with which it adheres. In all these methods, little attention would seem %0a%3c to be paid to the retention of the flavour of the fruits. %0a%3c %0a%3c A detestable practice, Fee says, as the oil makes an indelible mark %0a%3c on the grape, and gives it an abominable flavour. It is the best method %0a%3c to put the fruit in bags of paper or hair. %0a%3c " See B. xiii. c. 19. %0a%3c %0a%3c *^ There are about forty varieties now known. %0a%3c %0a%3c *" B. xiii. c. 14, 15.

Some of them, again, bear %0a%3c the name of the persons who were the first to introduce them, %0a%3c such, for instance, as the Livian^* and the Pompcian^^ figs : this %0a%3c last variety is the best for drying in the sun and keeping for %0a%3c use, from year to year ; the same is the case, too, with the %0a%3c marisca,^ and the kind which has a leaf spotted all over like %0a%3c the reed." There is also the Herculanean fig, the albicerata,** %0a%3c and the white aratia, a very large variety, with an extremely %0a%3c diminutive stalk. %0a%3c %0a%3c The earliest of them all is the porphyritis,^^ which has a %0a%3c stalk of remarkable length : it is closely followed by the popu- %0a%3c laris,*° one of the very smallest of the figs, and so called from %0a%3c the low esteem in which it is held : on the other hand, the %0a%3c chelidonia" is a kind that ripens the last of all, and to- %0a%3c wards the beginning of winter. In addition to these, there are %0a%3c figs that are at the same time both late and early, as they bear %0a%3c two crops in the year, one white and the other black,^^ ripen- %0a%3c ing at harvest-time and vintage respectively. There is another %0a%3c late fig also, that has received its name from the singular %0a%3c hardness of its skin ; one of the Chalcidian varieties bears as %0a%3c many as three times in the year. It is at Tarentum only that %0a%3c the remarkably sweet fig is grown which is known by the %0a%3c name of " ona." %0a%3c %0a%3c Speaking of figs, Cato has the following remarks : " Plant %0a%3c the fig caUed the ' marisca' on a chalky or open site, but for %0a%3c the African variety, the Herculanean, the Saguntine,^ the %0a%3c %0a%3c In Egypt.

Being a small %0a%3c variety of the fig-tree, they cover it up with manure at the end %0a%3c of autumn, by which means the fruit on it is overtaken by %0a%3c winter while still in a green state : then when the weather %0a%3c becomes milder the fruit is uncovered along with the tree, and %0a%3c so restored to light. Just as though it had come into birth %0a%3c afresh, the fruit imbibes the heat of the new sun with the %0a%3c greatest avidity — a difierent sun, in fact, to that which ori- %0a%3c ginally gave it life — and so ripens along with the blossom of %0a%3c the coming crop ; thus attaining maturity in a year not its %0a%3c own, and this in a country,'''' too, where the greatest cold %0a%3c prevails. %0a%3c %0a%3c CUAP. 20. IIISTOltlCAL ANECDOTES CONNECTED WITH THE FIG. %0a%3c %0a%3c "The mention by Cato of the variety which bears the name %0a%3c of the African fig, strongly recalls to my mind a remarkable %0a%3c fact connected with it and the countrj^ from which it takes %0a%3c its name. %0a%3c %0a%3c Burning with a mortal hatred to Carthage, anxious, too, for the %0a%3c safety of his posterity, and exclaiming at every sitting of the %0a%3c senate that Carthage must be destroyed, Cato one day brought %0a%3c with him into the Senate-house a ripe fig, the produce of that %0a%3c country . Exhibiting it to the assembled senators, " I ask you," %0a%3c said he, " when, do you suppose, this fruit was plucked from the %0a%3c tree ?" AU being of opinion that it had been but lately gathered, %0a%3c — Know then," was his reply, "that this fig was plucked at %0a%3c Carthage but the day before yesterday'^^-^so near is the enemy %0a%3c %0a%3c The modern " black" tig. %0a%3c "5 The sun of the former year. %0a%3c %0a%3c In Moesia — the present Servia and Bulgaria. %0a%3c " Another war is said to have originated in this fruit.

It was immediately after this occurrence that %0a%3c the third Punic war commenced, in which Carthage was %0a%3c destroyed, though Cato had breathed his last, the year after this %0a%3c event. In this trait which are we the most to admire ? was it %0a%3c ingenuity'^' and foresight on his part, or was it an accident that %0a%3c was thus aptly turned to advantage ? which, too, ia the most %0a%3c surprising, the extraordinary quickness of the passage which %0a%3c must have been made, or the bold daring of the man ? The %0a%3c thing, however, that is the most astonishing of all — indeed, I %0a%3c can conceive nothing more truly marvellous — is the fact that a %0a%3c city thus mighty, the rival of ilome for the sovereignty of the %0a%3c world during a period of one hundred and twenty years, owed %0a%3c its fall at last to an illustration drawn from a single fig ! %0a%3c %0a%3c Thus did this fig effect that which neither Trebia nor Thrasi- %0a%3c menus, not Cannaj itself, graced with the entombment of the %0a%3c Roman renown, not the Punic camp entrenched within three %0a%3c miles of the city, not even the disgrace of seeing Hannibal %0a%3c riding up to the Colline Gate, could suggest the means of %0a%3c accomplishing. It was left for a fig, in the hand of Cato, to %0a%3c show how near was Carthage to the gates of Rome ! %0a%3c %0a%3c In the Porum even, and in the very midst of the Comitium™ %0a%3c of Rome, a fig-tree is carefully cultivated, in memory of the %0a%3c consecration which took place on the occasion of a thunder- %0a%3c bolt' which once fell on that spot ; and still more, as a me- %0a%3c morial of the fig-tree which in former days overshadowed %0a%3c Romulus and Remus, the founders of our empire, in the Lu- %0a%3c percal Cave. This tree received the name of "ruminalis," %0a%3c from the circumstance that under it the wolf was found giving %0a%3c the breast — rumis it was called in those days — to the two %0a%3c infants.

These insects, deprived of all sus- %0a%3c tenance from their parent tree, at the moment that it is has- %0a%3c tening to rottenness and decay, wing their flight to others of %0a%3c kindred though cultivated kind. There feeding with avidity %0a%3c upon the fig, they penetrate it in numerous places, and by %0a%3c thus making their way to the inside, open the pores of the %0a%3c fruit. The moment they effect their entrance, the heat of %0a%3c the sun finds admission too, and through the inlets thus made %0a%3c the fecundating air is introduced. These insects speedily %0a%3c consume the milky juice that constitutes the chief support %0a%3c of the fruit in its infant®' state, a result which would other- %0a%3c wise be spontaneously effected by absorption : and hence it is %0a%3c that in the plantations of figs a wild fig is usually allowed to %0a%3c grow, being placed to the windward of the other trees in %0a%3c order that the breezes may bear from it upon them. Improving %0a%3c upon this discovery, branches of the wild fig are sometimes %0a%3c brought from a distance, and bundles tied together are placed %0a%3c upon the cultivated tree. This method, however, is not neces- %0a%3c sary when the trees are growing on a thin soil, or on a site %0a%3c exposed to the north-east wind ; for in these cases the figs will %0a%3c dry spontaneously, and the clefts which are made in the fruit %0a%3c effect the same ripening process which in other instances is %0a%3c brought about by the agency of these insects. Nor is it requisite %0a%3c to adopt this plan on spots which are liable to dust, such, for %0a%3c instance, as is generally the case with fig-trees planted by the %0a%3c side of much-frequented roads : the dust having the property %0a%3c of drying up®^ the juices of the fig, and so absorbing the %0a%3c milky humours. There is this superiority, however, in an ad- %0a%3c vantageous site over the methods of ripening by the agency of %0a%3c dust or by caprification, that the fruit is not so apt to fall ; for %0a%3c the secretion of the juices being thus prevented, the fig is not %0a%3c so heavy as it would otherwise be, and the branches are less %0a%3c brittle. %0a%3c %0a%3c All figs are soft to the touch, and when ripe contain grains*' %0a%3c %0a%3c " This insect is one of the Hymenoptera ; the Cynips Psenes of Linnisus %0a%3c and Fabricius. There is another insect of the same genus, but not so %0a%3c well known. %0a%3c %0a%3c F6e observes that the caprification accelerates the ripeness of the %0a%3c fruit, but at the expense of the flavour. For the same purpose the upper %0a%3c part of the fig is often pricked with a pointed quill. %0a%3c %0a%3c "1 " Infantiam pomi " — literally, " the infancy of the fruit." %0a%3c %0a%3c ^- Fee denies the truth of this assertion. ss Frumenta. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 21.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c caphification. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 313 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c in the interior.

NINE VAEIETIES OF THE KUT. %0a%3c %0a%3c The walnut, " which would almost claim precedence of the %0a%3c sorb in size, yields the palm to it in reference to the esteem %0a%3c in which they are respectively held ; and this, although it is %0a%3c 60 favourite an accompaniment of the Fescennine songs at %0a%3c nuptials. This nut, taken as a whole, is very considerably %0a%3c smaller than the pine nut, but the kernel is larger in propor- %0a%3c tion. Nature, too, has conferred upon it a peculiar honour, in %0a%3c protecting it with a two-fold covering, the first of which forms %0a%3c a hollowed cushion for it to rest upon, and the second is a %0a%3c woody shell. It is for this reason that this fruit has been %0a%3c looked upon as a symbol consecrated to marriage,'* its off- %0a%3c spring being thus protected in such manifold ways : an expla- %0a%3c nation which bears a much greater air of probability than that %0a%3c which would derive it from the rattling which it makes when %0a%3c it bounds from the floor. The Greek names that have been %0a%3c given to this fruit fully prove that it, like many others, has %0a%3c been originally introduced from Persis ; the best kinds being %0a%3c known in that language by the names of " Persicum,'"'' and %0a%3c " basilicon these, in fact, being the names by which they %0a%3c %0a%3c Sprengel to be identical -with the Crataegus azarolus of Linnaeus.

The only difference in the %0a%3c several varieties consists in the relative hardness or brittleness %0a%3c of the shell, it being thin or thick, full of compartments or %0a%3c smooth and uniform. This is the only fruit that Nature has %0a%3c enclosed in a covering formed of pieces soldered together ; the %0a%3c shell, in fact, forming a couple of boats, while the kernel is %0a%3c divided into four separate compartments-^ by the intervention %0a%3c of a ligneous membrane. %0a%3c %0a%3c In all the other kinds, the fruit and the shell respectively %0a%3c are of one solid piece, as we find the case with the hazel-nut,^ %0a%3c and another variety of the nut formerly known as " Abcl- %0a%3c lina," from the name*" of the district in which it was first %0a%3c produced : it was first introduced into Asia and Greece from %0a%3c Pontus, whence the name that is sometimes given to it — the %0a%3c "Pontic nut."

The %0a%3c chesnut has its armour of defence in a shell bristling with %0a%3c prickles like the hedge-hog, an envelope which in the acorn %0a%3c is only partially developed. It is really surprising, however, %0a%3c that Nature should have taken such pains thus to conceal an %0a%3c object of so little value. "We sometimes find as many as %0a%3c three nuts beneath a single outer shell. The skin^^ of the nut %0a%3c is limp and flexible : there is a membrane, too, which lies %0a%3c next to the body of the fruit, and which, both in this and in %0a%3c the walnut, spoils the flavour if not taken off. Chesnuts are %0a%3c the most pleasant eating when roasted they are sometimes %0a%3c ground also, and are eaten by women when fasting for reli- %0a%3c gious scruples,''^ as bearing some resemblance to bread. It is %0a%3c from Sardes" that the chesnut was first introduced, and hence %0a%3c it is that the Greeks have given it the name of the " Sardian %0a%3c acorn;" for the name "Dies balanon" was given at a later %0a%3c period, after it had been considerably improved by cultivation. %0a%3c %0a%3c At the present day there are numerous varieties of the %0a%3c chesnut.

THE FETJIT OF THE AKBTTTTJS. %0a%3c %0a%3c The flesh of the ground-strawberry"* is very different to %0a%3c that of the arbute-tree,^ which is of a kindred kind : indeed, %0a%3c this is the only instance in which we find a similar fruit grow- %0a%3c ing upon a tree and on the ground. The tree is tufted and %0a%3c bushy ; the fruit takes a year to ripen, the blossoms of the %0a%3c young fruit flowering whUe that of the preceding year is %0a%3c arriving at maturity. Whether it is the male tree or the %0a%3c female that is unproductive, authors are not generally agreed. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is a fruit held in no esteem, in proof of which it has %0a%3c %0a%3c words to denote the difference between " acinus" and " bacca." Tbe lat- %0a%3c ter is properly the " berry ;" the grape being the type of the " acinus." %0a%3c %0a%3c 59 See B. xvi. c. 41. The mulberry is the Morus nigra of modern %0a%3c naturalists. It is generally thought that this was the only variety known %0a%3c to the ancients ; but Fee queries, from the story of Pyramus and Thisbc, %0a%3c which represents the mulberry as changing from white to blood colour, %0a%3c that the white mulberry was not unknown to them ; but through some %0a%3c cause, now unknown, was gradually lost sight of. %0a%3c %0a%3c fi" This is still the case with the mulberry. %0a%3c %0a%3c 61 See B. xvi. c. 71, andB. xxiv. c. 73.

THE RELATIVE NATTJIiES OF BEKKY FRUITS. %0a%3c %0a%3c There is a great difference also among the various acinus %0a%3c fruits. First of all, among the grapes, we find considerable %0a%3c difference in respect to their firmness, the thinness or thick- %0a%3c ness of the skin, and the stone inside the fruit, which in some %0a%3c varieties is remarkably small, and in others even double in %0a%3c number : these last producing but very little juice. Very dif- %0a%3c ferent, again, are the berries of the ivy"' and the elder as %0a%3c also those in the pomegranate,*^ these being the only ones that %0a%3c are of an angular shape. These last, also, have not a mem- %0a%3c brane for each individual grain, but one to cover them all iu %0a%3c common, and of a pale colour. All these fruits consist, too, %0a%3c of juice and flesh, and those more particularly which have but %0a%3c small seeds inside. %0a%3c %0a%3c There are great varieties, too, among the berry™ fruits; %0a%3c the berry of the olive being quite different from that of the %0a%3c laurel, the berry of the lotus'' from that of the cornel, and %0a%3c that of the mj'rtle from the berry of the lentisk. Tlie berry, %0a%3c however, of the aquifolium"- and the thoru'^ is quite destitute %0a%3c of juice. %0a%3c %0a%3c The cherry occupies a middle place between the berry and %0a%3c the acinus fruit : it is white at first, wliicli is the case also %0a%3c %0a%3c He siij^gcsts that it is so called from " uimm edo," " I eat but one ;" %0a%3c a rather fanciful etymology, it would seem. %0a%3c %0a%3c This supposition is uot warranted, from merely the fact of there being %0a%3c two names.

(25.) — NINE VAKIETIES OF THE CHERRY. %0a%3c %0a%3c The cherry did not exist in Italy before the period of the %0a%3c victory gained over Mithridates by L. Lucullus, in the year %0a%3c of the City 680. He was the first to introduce this tree from %0a%3c Pontus, and now, in the course of one hundred and twenty %0a%3c years, it has travelled beyond the Ocean, and arrived in Bri- %0a%3c tannia even. The cherry, as we have already stated," in spite %0a%3c of every care, it has been found impossible to rear in Egypt. %0a%3c Of this fruit, that known as the " Apronian" is the reddest %0a%3c varietj', the Lutatian'' being the blackest, and the Ca;ciliau'" %0a%3c perfectly round. The Junian" cherry has an agreeable flavour, %0a%3c but onh*, so to saj^, when eaten beneath the tree, as they are %0a%3c so remarkably delicate that they will not bear carrying. The %0a%3c higliest rank, however, has been awarded to the duracinus*" %0a%3c variety, known in Campania as the " Plinian''®' cherry, and in %0a%3c lielgica to the Lusitanian"^- cherry, as also to one that grows %0a%3c on the banks of the llhenus. This last kind has a third %0a%3c colour, being a mixture*'* of black, red, and green, and has %0a%3c always the appearance of being just on the turn to ripening. %0a%3c It is less than five years since the kind known as the " laurel- %0a%3c cherry" was introduced, of a bitter but not unpleasant flavour, %0a%3c %0a%3c ■'5 He must alhidc to what lie has stated in B. xii. c. 3, for he has no- %0a%3c where said that the cherry will not grow in Jtgypt.

THIRTEEN DIFFERENT FLAVOURS OF JUICES. %0a%3c %0a%3c While upon this subject, it may be as well to state that %0a%3c there are no less than thirteen different flavours^' belonging %0a%3c %0a%3c Such a graft is impossible ; the laurel-cheiry must have had some %0a%3c other origin. %0a%3c %0a%3c Fee'suggests that this maybe the early dwarf cherry. %0a%3c 86 Or " ground-cherry ;" a dwarf variety, if, indeed, it was a cherry-tree %0a%3c at all, of which Fee expresses some doubt. %0a%3c %0a%3c This explains, Feu says, why it will not ^row in Egypt. %0a%3c The Corims mas of Linnreus. The fruit of the cornel has a tart %0a%3c flavour, but is not eaten in modern Europe, except by school-boys. %0a%3c S5 That produces mastich. See B. xii. c. 36. %0a%3c %0a%3c ^ lie alludes more especially, perliaps, to the use of cicuta or hemlock %0a%3c by drunkards, who looked upon it as an antidote to the effects of wine. %0a%3c Sec B. xiv. c. 7. %0a%3c %0a%3c Fee remarks, that in this enumeration there is no method. Linnaeus %0a%3c enumerates eleven principal flavours in the vegetable kingdora--dry or %0a%3c insipid, aqueous, viscous, salt, acrid, styptic, sweet, fat, bitter, acid, and %0a%3c nauseous ; these terms, however seem, some of them, to be very indefinite. %0a%3c %0a%3c T 2 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 324 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c PLIKY'S natural UISTOllT. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XV. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c in common to the fruits and the various juices : the sweet, the %0a%3c luscious, the unctuous, the bitter, the rough, tlie acrid,*'* the %0a%3c pungent, the sharp, the sour, and the salt ; in addition to %0a%3c which, there are three otlier kinds of flavours of a nature that is %0a%3c truly singular. The first of these last kiuds is tliat flavour in %0a%3c which several other flavours are united, as in wine, for in- %0a%3c stance ; for in it we are sensible of the rough, the pungent," %0a%3c and the luscious, all at the same moment, and all of them %0a%3c flavours that belong to other substances. The second of these %0a%3c flavours is that in wliich we are sensible at the same instant %0a%3c of a flavour that belongs to another substance, and yet of one %0a%3c that is peculiar to the individual object of which we are tast- %0a%3c ing, such as that of milk, for instance : indeed, in milk we %0a%3c cannot correctly say that there is any pronounced flavour that %0a%3c is either sweet, or unctuous, or luscious, a sort of smooth taste'^ %0a%3c in the mouth being predominant, which holds the place of a %0a%3c more decided flavour. The third instance is that of water, %0a%3c which has no flavour whatever, nor, indeed, any flavouring %0a%3c principle but still, this very absence of flavour is considered %0a%3c as constituting one of them, and forming a peculiar class'" of %0a%3c itself ; so much so, indeed, that if in water any taste or flavour- %0a%3c ing principle is detected, it is looked upon as impure. %0a%3c %0a%3c In the perception of all these various flavours the smell %0a%3c plays a very considerable'''' part, there being a very great %0a%3c affinity between them. Water, however, is properly quite in- %0a%3c odorous : and if the least smell' is to be perceived, it is not %0a%3c pure water. It is a singular thing that three of the principal %0a%3c elements of Nature — water, air, and fire— should have neither %0a%3c taste nor smell, nor, indeed, any flavouring principle whatever. %0a%3c %0a%3c It requires considerable discernment to appropriate nicely its £no-lish %0a%3c synonym to these four varieties of tastes, " acer, acutus, acerbus^and %0a%3c acidus," more especially when we find that the "bitter" and the "rouo-L" %0a%3c are occupied already by the " amarus " and the " austerus." ° %0a%3c In allusion, probably, to the pungency of the aroma or bouquet. %0a%3c ^* Lenitate. %0a%3c %0a%3c This seems to be the meaning of " succus." %0a%3c ^ The " insipid." %0a%3c %0a%3c ^' This is so much the case, that the most nauseous medicine mav he %0a%3c taken almost with impunity— so far as taste is concerned — by tightly press- %0a%3c ing the nostrils while taking it. %0a%3c %0a%3c ^5 Fee remarks that this is true of fire, and of distilled or perfectly pure %0a%3c water ; but that physiologists are universally agreed that the air has iU %0a%3c own peculiar smell. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 33 ] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c COLOUll AND SM1;LI; OF JUICES. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 325 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 33. (28.) — THE colour and smrll of juices. %0a%3c %0a%3c Among the juices, those of a vinous** flavour belong to the %0a%3c peur, the mulberry, and the myrtle, and not to the grape, a %0a%3c very singular fact. An unctuous taste is detected in the olive/ %0a%3c the laurel, the walnut, and the almond ; sweetness exists in %0a%3c the grape, the fig, and the date ; while in the plum class Ave %0a%3c find a watery- juice. There is a considerable difference, too, %0a%3c in the colours assumed by the various juices. That of the %0a%3c mulberry, the cherry, the cornel, and the black grape resem- %0a%3c bles the colour of blood, while in the white grape the juice is %0a%3c white. The humour found in the summit of the fig^ is of a %0a%3c milky nature, but not so with the juice found in the body of %0a%3c the fruit. In the apple it is the colour of foam,* while in the %0a%3c peach it is perfectly colourless, and this is the case, too, witli %0a%3c tlie duracinus,* which abounds in juice ; for who can say that %0a%3c he has ever detected any colour in it r %0a%3c %0a%3c Smell, too, presents its own peculiar marvels ; in the apple %0a%3c it is pungent,® and it is weak in the peach, Avhile in the sweet' %0a%3c fruits we perceive none at all : so, too, the sweet wines are %0a%3c inodorous, while the thinner ones have more aroma, and are %0a%3c much sooner fit for use than those of a thicker nature." The %0a%3c odoriferous fruits are not pleasing to the palate in the same %0a%3c degree, seeing that the flavour* of them does not come up to %0a%3c their smell : hence it is that in the citron Ave find the smell %0a%3c fruits that are rich in sugar and amidine, Fee says, either have, %0a%3c or acquire in time, a vinous flavour, by the development of a certain quan- %0a%3c tity of alcohol. %0a%3c %0a%3c In the fruit with a fixed oil, this principle succeeds, when tliey are %0a%3c ripe, to the mucilaginous. %0a%3c %0a%3c 2 He must mean a thinner juice, though still sweet. %0a%3c %0a%3c 3 About the peduncle or stallc of the tig. The juice here Fee says, is a %0a%3c real suo-ar, of tiie same nature as that which circulates throughout the %0a%3c whole fruit : the juice in the interior of which is produced by another order %0a%3c ot' Vessels %0a%3c %0a%3c * The iuicc is only foatny when the vinous fermentation is established. %0a%3c It has that appearance, however, when the fruit is bitten with the teeth. %0a%3c ^ The " iiard-berry," or nectarine. %0a%3c 6 In the sense of aromatic, or penetrating. %0a%3c %0a%3c ' He probably means those of a luscious or sinipy nature, without any %0a%3c %0a%3c acidity whatever. . . . , , %0a%3c %0a%3c H lie seems to mean that the thick, luscious wines require longer keep- %0a%3c ing, before they will gain any aroma at all.

Some fruits grow in a pod which is %0a%3c sweet itself, and contains a bitter seed : whereas in most kinds %0a%3c of fruit the seed is agreeable to the palate, those which grow %0a%3c in a pod are condemned. Other fruits are berries, with the %0a%3c stone within and the flesh without, as in the olive and the %0a%3c cherry : others, again, have the berry within and the stone %0a%3c without, the case, as we have ab'eady stated, with the berries %0a%3c that grow in Egypt. %0a%3c %0a%3c Those fruits, known as " pomes," have the same character- %0a%3c istics as the berry fruits ; in some of them we find the body of %0a%3c the fruit within and the shell without, as in the nut, for ex- %0a%3c ample ; others, again, have the meat of the fruit without and %0a%3c the shell within, the peach and the plum, for instance : the %0a%3c refuse part being thus surrounded with the flesh, while in %0a%3c other fruits the flesh is surrounded by the refuse part." %0a%3c nuts are enclosed in a shell, chesnuts in a skin ; in chesnuts %0a%3c the skin is taken off", but in medlars it is eaten with the rest. %0a%3c Acorns are covered with a crust, grapes with a husk, and %0a%3c pomegranates with a skin and an inner membrane. The mul- %0a%3c berry is composed of flesh and juice, while the cherry consists %0a%3c of juice and skin. In some fruits the flesh separates easily %0a%3c from the woody part, the walnut and the date, for instance ; %0a%3c in others it adheres, as in the case of the olive and the laurel %0a%3c berry: some kinds, again, partake of both natures, the peach, %0a%3c for example ; for in the duracinus''' kind the flesh adheres to %0a%3c the stone, and cannot be torn away from it, while in the other %0a%3c %0a%3c The reading here should he " acutissimus," prohahly, instead of %0a%3c " acerrimus." The odour exists in the rind of the citron and in the outer %0a%3c coat of the quince ; if these are removed, the fruit hecomes inodorous. %0a%3c " "Tenuis." He may possibly mean " faint." %0a%3c %0a%3c 12 The fruit of the ben, or myrobalanus, the Balanites ^gyptiaca. See %0a%3c B. xiii. cc. 17 and 19. %0a%3c %0a%3c '3 Vitium. " Ilard-herry or nectarine.

In some fruits there is no %0a%3c stone or shell'* either within or without, one variety of tlio %0a%3c date,'* for instance. In some kinds, again, the shell is eaten, %0a%3c just the same as the fruit ; this we have already mentioned as %0a%3c being the case with a variety of the almond found in Egypt.''' %0a%3c Some fruits have on the outside a twofold refuse covering, the %0a%3c chcsnut, the almond, and the walnut, for example. ISome, %0a%3c again, are composed of three separate parts — the body of the %0a%3c fruit, then a woody shell, and inside of that a kernel, as in the %0a%3c peach. %0a%3c %0a%3c Some fruits grow closely packed together, such as grapes %0a%3c and sorbs : these last, just like so many grapes in a cluster, %0a%3c cling round the branch and bend it downwards with their %0a%3c weight. On the other hand, some fruits grow separately, at a %0a%3c distance from one another; this is the case with the peacli. %0a%3c Some fruits are enclosed in a sort of matrix, as with the grains %0a%3c of the pomegranate : some hang down from a stalk, such as %0a%3c the pear, for instance: others hang in clusters, grapes and %0a%3c dates, for example. Others, again, grow upon stalks and %0a%3c bunches united : this we find the case with the berries of the %0a%3c ivy and the elder. Some adhere close to the branches, like %0a%3c the laurel berry, while other varieties lie close to the branch %0a%3c or hang from it, as the case may be : thus we find in the olive %0a%3c some fruit with short stalks, and others with long. Some fruits %0a%3c grow with a little calyx at the top, the pomegranate, for ex- %0a%3c ample, the medlar, and the lotus"^ of Egypt and the Euphrates. %0a%3c %0a%3c Then, too, as to the various parts of fruit, they are held in %0a%3c different degrees of esteem according to their respective re- %0a%3c commendations. In the date it is the flesh that is usually %0a%3c liked, in those of Thebais it is the crust;'" the grape and the %0a%3c caryota date are esteemed for their juice, the pear and tl;e %0a%3c apple for their firmness, the melimelum-'^ for its soft meat, %0a%3c %0a%3c " Lignum : literally, " wood."

I am not quite %0a%3c sure, too, whether this tree was not the very first that was %0a%3c planted in the public places of Kome, the result of some omi- %0a%3c nous presage by the augurs of wondrous import. For at the %0a%3c Temple of Quirinus, or, in other words, of Eomulus himself, %0a%3c one of the most ancient in Home, there were formerly two %0a%3c myrtle- trees, which grew for a long period just in front of %0a%3c tlie temple ; one of these was called the Patrician tree, the %0a%3c other the Plebeian.

The kind known as %0a%3c " oxymyrsine,"" belongs only to the wild variety : ornamental %0a%3c gardeners classify several varieties of the cultivated kind ; the %0a%3c " Tarentine,"^^ they speak of as a myrtle with a small leaf, %0a%3c the myrtle of this country as having a broad leaf, and the %0a%3c hexasticha*' as being very thickly covered with leaves, growing %0a%3c in rows of six : it is not, however, made any use of. There %0a%3c are two other kinds, that are branchy and well covered. In %0a%3c my opinion, the conjugula is the same that is now called the %0a%3c Roman myrtle. It is in Egypt that the myrtle is most %0a%3c odoriferous. %0a%3c %0a%3c Cato^® has taught us how to make a wine from the black %0a%3c myrtle, by drying it thoroughly in the shade, and then putting %0a%3c it in must : he says, also, that if the berries are not quite dry, %0a%3c it will produce an oil. Since his time a method has been dis- %0a%3c covered of making a pale wine from the white variety ; two %0a%3c sextarii of pounded myrtle are steeped in three semi-sextarii of %0a%3c wine, and the mixture is then subjected to pressure. %0a%3c %0a%3c The leaves*^ also are dried by themselves till they are capa- %0a%3c ble of being reduced to a powder, which is used for the treat- %0a%3c ment of sores on the human body : this powder is of a slightly %0a%3c corrosive nature, and is employed also for the purpose of %0a%3c checking the perspiration.

THE MYRTLE USED AT ROME IN OVATIONS. %0a%3c %0a%3c The myrtle has played " its part, also, in the successes of %0a%3c war.

Cato^^ speaks of two %0a%3c varieties of this tree, the Delphic and the Cyprian. Pompeius %0a%3c Lenifius has added another, to which he has given the name of %0a%3c " mustax," from the circumstance of its being used for putting %0a%3c under the cake known by the name of " mustaceum."" He %0a%3c says that this variety has a very large leaf, flaccid, and of a %0a%3c whitish hue ; that the Delphic laurel is of one uniform colour, %0a%3c greener than the other, with berries of very large size, and of %0a%3c a red tint approaching to green. He says, too, that it is with %0a%3c this laurel that the victors at Delphi*'^ are crowned, and warriors %0a%3c who enjoy the honours of a triumph at Eome.

There is the tinus^' for instance, by some con- %0a%3c sidered as a species of wild laurel, while others, again, regard %0a%3c it as a tree of a separate class ; indeed, it does differ from tho %0a%3c laurel as to the colour, the berry being of an azure blue. The %0a%3c royal'** laurel, too, has since been added, which has of latj %0a%3c l)egun to be known as the " Augustan : " both the tree, as %0a%3c Avell as the leaf, are of remarkable size, and the berries have %0a%3c not the usual rough taste. Some say, however, that the royal %0a%3c laurel and the Augustan are not the same tree, and make out %0a%3c the former to be a peculiar kind, with a leaf both longer and %0a%3c broader than that of the Augustan. The same authors, also, %0a%3c make a peculiar species of the bacalia the commonest laurel %0a%3c of all, and the one that bears the greatest number of berries. %0a%3c "With them, too, the barren laurcP^ is the laurel of the tri- %0a%3c umphs, and they say that this is the one that is used by war- %0a%3c riors when enjoying a triumph — a thing that surprises me %0a%3c very much ; unless, indeed, the use of it was first introduced %0a%3c by the late Emperor Augustus, and it is to be considered as %0a%3c the progeny of that laurel, which, as we shall just now have %0a%3c occasion to mention, was sent to him from heaven ; it being the %0a%3c smallest of them all, with a crisped ™ short leaf, and very rarely %0a%3c to be met with. %0a%3c %0a%3c In ornamental gardening we also find the taxa"' employed, %0a%3c with a small leaf sprouting from the middle of the leaf, and %0a%3c forming a fringe, as it were, hanging from it ; the spadonia,'- %0a%3c too, without this fringe, a tree that thrives remarkably well %0a%3c in the shade : indeed, however dense the shade may be, it will %0a%3c soon cover the spot with its shoots.

From the root it throws out %0a%3c branches threB quarters of a foot in length ; it is much used %0a%3c in ornamental gardening, and for making wreaths, and it has %0a%3c a more pointed leaf than that of the myrtle, and superior to it %0a%3c in softness, whiteness, and size : the seed, which lies between %0a%3c the leaves, is red. This last kind grows in great abundance %0a%3c on Mount Ida and in the vicinity of Heraclea in Pontus : it is %0a%3c only found, however, in mountainous districts. %0a%3c %0a%3c The laurel, too, known as the daphnoides,'^ is a variety that %0a%3c has received many different names : by some it is called tlie %0a%3c Pelasgian laurel, by others the euthalon, and by others the %0a%3c stephanon Alexandri.''

Another reason, too, may be the fact, that of all %0a%3c the shrubs that are planted and received in our houses, this is %0a%3c the only one that is never struck by lightning.^ It is for %0a%3c these reasons, in my opinion, that the post of honour lias been %0a%3c awarded to the laurel more particularly in triumphs, and not, %0a%3c as Massurius says, because it was used for the purposes of %0a%3c fumigation and purification from the blood of the enemy. %0a%3c %0a%3c In addition to the above particulars, it is not permitted to %0a%3c defile the laurel and the olive by applying them to profane %0a%3c uses; so much so, indeed, that, not even for the propitiation of %0a%3c the divinities, should a fire be lighted with them at either %0a%3c altar or shrine.^ Indeed, it is very evident that the laurel pro- %0a%3c tests against such usage by crackling*' as it does in the fire, %0a%3c thus, in a manner, giving expresssion to its abhorrence of such %0a%3c treatment.

See B. ixiii. c. 80. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 336 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c PLINY's NATTTRAi HISTOET. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XV. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c in the habit of putting on a wreath of laurel to allay his ap- %0a%3c prehensions of disastrous eiFects from the lightning. ihere %0a%3c are also some remarkable facts connected with the laurel in %0a%3c the history of the late Emperor Augustus : once while Li via %0a%3c Drusilla, who afterwards on her marriage with tlie Emperor %0a%3c assumed the name of Augusta, at the time that she was %0a%3c affianced to him, was seated, there fell into her lap a hen of %0a%3c remarkable whiteness, which an eagle let fall from aloft with- %0a%3c out its receiving the slightest injuiy : on Livia viewing it %0a%3c without any symptoms of alarm, it was discovered that miracle %0a%3c was added to miracle, and that it held in its beak a branch of %0a%3c laurel covered Avith berries. The aruspices gave orders that %0a%3c the hen and her progeny should be carefully preserved, and %0a%3c the branch planted and tended with religious care. This was %0a%3c accordingly done at the country-house belonging to the Cajsars, %0a%3c on the Flaminian Way, near the banks of the Tiber, eight %0a%3c miles from the City ; from which circumstance that road has %0a%3c since received the title "Ad gallinas." From the branch %0a%3c there has now arisen, wondrous to relate, quite a grove : and %0a%3c Augustus Caisar afterwards, when celebrating a triumph, held %0a%3c a branch of it in his hand and wore a wreath of this laurel on %0a%3c his head ; since which time all the succeeding emperors have %0a%3c followed his example. Hence, too, has originated the custom of %0a%3c planting the branches which they have held on these occasions, %0a%3c and we thus see groves of laurel still existing which owe their %0a%3c respective names to this circumstance. It was on the above %0a%3c occasion, too, that not improbably a change was effected in %0a%3c the usual laurel of the triumph."^ The laurel is the only one %0a%3c among the trees that in the Latin language has given an %0a%3c appellation to a man,^^ and it is the only one the leaf of which %0a%3c has a distinct name of its own, — it being known by the name %0a%3c of " laurea." The name of this tree is still retained by one %0a%3c place in the city of Eome, for we find a spot on the Aventine %0a%3c %0a%3c * Suetonius, c. 66, confirms tbis. Fee says that the same superstition %0a%3c still exists in some parts of France, See B. ii. c. 56. %0a%3c %0a%3c 90 " The Poultry." See c. 39 of this Book. %0a%3c %0a%3c See B. xxxi. c. 3. As Poinsinet remarks, this is not strictly true; %0a%3c the name " Vinucius " most probably came from " vinea," a vineyard. %0a%3c Numerous names were derived also from seeds and vegetables ; Piso, %0a%3c Cicero, and Lactuca, for instance, among a host of others. " Scipio," too, %0a%3c means a " walking-stick." %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 337 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Mount still known by the name of " Loretum,"^^ where for- %0a%3c merly a laurel-grove existed. The laurel is employed in %0a%3c purifications, and we may here mention, incidentally, that it %0a%3c will grow from slips"— though Democritus and Theophrastus %0a%3c have expressed their doubts as to that fact. %0a%3c %0a%3c We shall now proceed to speak of the forest trees. %0a%3c %0a%3c SuMirARY. — Remarkable facts, narratives, and observations, %0a%3c one hundred and twenty. %0a%3c %0a%3c Roman attthoks qttoted. — Fenestella,"' Fabianus,^^ Virgil," %0a%3c Corn.
