text=THE  THIRD   BOOK %0a%0a%0aHISTORY    OF    NATURE %0a%0a%0aWRITTEN    BY %0a%0a%0aC.   PLINIUS  SECUNDUS. %0a%0a%0aTHE   PREFACE. %0a%0a%0awe  have  written  of  the  Position  and %0aWonders  of  the  Earth,  Waters,  and  Stars  :  also %0aof  the  Proportion  and  Measure  of  the  whole %0aWorld.  Now  we  proceed  to  the  Parts  thereof; %0aalthough  this  also  be  judged  an  infinite  Piece %0aof  Work,  and  not  lightly  to  be  handled  without %0asome  Reprehension  :  and  yet  in  no  kind  of  Enterprise  is %0aPardon  more  due  ;  since  it  is  little  Wonder,  if  he  who  is  born %0aa  Man  knoweth  not  all  Things  belonging  to  Man.  And %0atherefore,  I  will  not  follow  one  Author  particularly,  but %0aevery  one  as  I  shall  think  him  most  true  in  each  Part.  Be- %0acause it  hath  been  common,  in  a  Manner,  to  them  all,  to  de- %0ascribe the  Situations  of  those  Places  most  exactly,  from %0awhence  themselves  proceeded  :  and,  therefore,  neither  will  I %0ablame  nor  reprove  any  Man.  The  bare  Names  of  Places %0ashall  be  simply  set  down  ;  and  that  with  as  much  Brevity  as %0aI  can  :  the  Excellency,  as  well  as  the  Causes,  being  deferred %0ato  their  several  Treatises  :  for  now  the  Question  is  touching %0athe  Earth  in  general.  And,  therefore,  I  would  have  Things %0ato  be  taken  as  if  the  Names  of  Countries  were  put  down  void %0aof  Renown,  and  such  only  as  they  were  in  the  Beginning, %0a%0a%0aBOOK  III.]  History  of  Nature.  151 %0a%0abefore  any  Acts  were  done ;  and  as  if  they  had  indeed  an %0aEnduement  of  Names,  but  respective  only  to  the  World  and %0aNature  of  Things. %0a%0aThe  whole  Globe  of  the  Earth  is  divided  into  three  Parts, %0aEurope,  Asia,  and  Africa.  The  Beginning  we  take  from  the %0aWest  and  the  Straits  of  Gades,  where  the  Atlantic  Ocean %0abreaking  in,  is  spread  into  the  inland  Seas.  Entering  there, %0aAfrica  is  on  the  right  Hand,  Europe  on  the  left,  and  Asia %0abetween  them.  The  Bounds  confining  these  are  the  Rivers %0aTanais  and  Nil  us.  The  Mouth  of  the  Ocean  of  which  I  spoke %0alyeth  out  in  Length  fifteen  Miles,  and  in  Breadth  five,  from %0aa  Village  in  Spain  called  Mellaria  to  the  Promontory  of %0aAfrica  called  the  White,  as  Turannius  Graccula,  who  was %0aborn  there,  writeth.  T.  Livius  and  Nepos  Cornelius  have %0areported,  that  the  Breadth,  where  it  is  narrowest,  is  seven %0aMiles,  and  ten  Miles  where  it  is  broadest.  From  so  small  a %0aMouth  spreadeth  so  vast  an  Expanse  of  Waters ;  nor  doth %0asuch  exceeding  Depth  lessen  the  Wonder.  In  the  very %0aMouth  of  it  are  many  Shelves  of  white  Sands,  to  the  great %0aTerror  of  Ships  passing  that  Way.  And  therefore,  many %0ahave  called  those  Straits  the  Entry  of  the  Mediterranean  Sea. %0aNear  to  the  Sides  of  this  Gullet,  are  set  two  Mountains,  one %0aon  each  Side,  as  Barriers  to  shut  all  in :  which  are,  Abila  for %0aAfrica,  and  Calpe  for  Europe,  the  Limits  of  the  Labours  of %0aHercules.  For  which  Cause,  the  Inhabitants  of  those  Parts %0acall  them  the  Pillars  of  that  God  ;  and  they  believe,  that %0aby  Ditches  digged  within  the  Continent,  the  Ocean,  before %0aexcluded,  was  let  in  ;  and  so  the  Face  of  the  Earth  was %0achanged. %0a%0a%0aCHAPTER  I. %0a%0aOf  Europe 1 . %0a%0aAND  first,  of  Europe,  the  Nurse  of  that  People  which  is %0athe  Conqueror  of  all  Nations  ;  and  of  all  Lands  by  many %0a%0a1  This  claim  of  superiority  is  advanced  by  the  Roman,  in  the  con- %0asciousness of  his  country's  power  and  greatness;  and  although  1800  years %0a%0a%0a1 52  History  of  Na  ture.

The  Ocean,  then,  at  this  Space %0aabovesaid  entereth  into  the  Atlantic  Sea,  and  with  a  greedy %0aCurrent  drowneth  those  Lands  which  dread  his  coming ; %0abut  those  Shores  that  resist,  with  its  windings  it  eateth  and %0ahollo weth  continually,  excavating  many  Creeks  in  Europe, %0awherein  four  remarkable  Gulfs  are  to  be  seen. %0a%0aOf  these  the  first,  from  Calpe,  the  remotest  Promontory %0a(as  is  abovesaid)  of  Spain,  is  bent  with  an  exceeding  great %0aCompass,  to  Locri ;  and  as  far  as  the  Promontory  Brutium. %0aWithin  it  lieth  Spain,  the  first  of  Lands  ;  that  Part,  I  mean, %0awhich,  in  regard  of  Rome,  is  the  further  off,  and  is  named %0aalso  Boetica.  And  presently  from  the  End  of  Virgitanus, %0athe  hither  Part,  otherwise  called  Tarraconensis,  as  far  as  the %0aPyrenean  Mountains.  That  further  Part  is  divided  into  two %0aProvinces  through  the  Length  :  for  on  the  North  Side  of %0aBoetica  lieth  Lusitania,  divided  from  it  by  the  River  Ana. %0a%0aThis  River  beginneth  in  the  Territory  Larninitanus  of  the %0anearer  Spain,  one  while  spreading  out  itself  into  Pools,  then %0aagain  gathering  into  narrow  Brooks  :  or  altogether  hidden %0aunder  Ground,  and  taking  Pleasure  to  rise  up  oftentimes, %0afalleth  into  the  Atlantic  Ocean.  But  the  Part  named  Tarra- %0aconensis, lying  close  to  the  Pyrenean  Mountain  and  running %0aalong  all  the  Side  thereof,  and,  at  the  same  Time,  stretching %0aout  itself  across  from  the  Iberian  Sea  to  the  Gallic  Ocean, %0ais  separated  from  Boetica  and  Lusitania  by  the  Mountain %0a%0ahave  passed,  and  that  greatness  has  departed  like  a  dream,  European %0asuperiority  still  exists.  A  prophecy  from  the  remotest  ages  (Gen.  ix.  27) %0a—  delivered  under  circumstances  in  which  its  fulfilment  was  exceedingly %0aunlikely  —  has  proclaimed,  that  the  God  whom  Pliny  did  not  know  shall %0aenlarge  Japhet,  the  father  of  European  nations  ;  —  that  he  shall  dwell  in %0athe  tents  of  Shem,  and  Canaan  shall  be  his  servant.  And,  accordingly, %0awe  see  the  inhabitants  of  Europe  spreading  out,  and  exerting  a  mastery, %0ain  the  most  distant  climes ;  in  the  strength  of  their  superiority  in  the  arts %0aof  life,  in  science,  the  freedom  of  their  political  institutions,  and,  above  all, %0ain  religion.  The  superiority  must  continue  so  long  as  this  foundation  of %0ait  shall  exist.  Esto  perpetua. —  Wern.

Therein  are  held %0afour  judicial  Assemblies;  the  Gaditan,  Cordubian,  Astigitan, %0aand  Hispalensian.  All  the  Towns  in  it  are  in  (Oppida)  Num- %0aber 175;  whereof  eight  are  Colonies;  free  Boroughs  (Muni- %0acipia),  eight ;  Towns  endued  with  the  ancient  Franchises  of %0aLatiuni,  twenty-nine  :  with  Freedom,  six;  Confederate,  four; %0aTributary,  120.  Of  which  those  that  be  worth  the  naming, %0aor  are  more  current  in  the  Latin  Tongue,  be  these  under- %0awritten :  from  the  River  Ana  the  Coast  of  the  Ocean,  the %0aTown  (Oppidum)  Ossonoba,  surnamed  also  Lusturia.  Two %0aRivers,  Luxia  and  Urium1,  run  between  the  Mountains  Ariani : %0athe  River  Bretis:  the  Shore  Corense :  with  a  winding  Creek. %0aOver  against  which  lieth  Gades,  to  be  spoken  of  among  the %0aIslands.  The  Promontory  of  Juno :  the  Haven  Besippo. %0aThe  Towns  Belon  and  Mellaria.  The  Straits  out  of  the %0aAtlantic  Sea.  Carteia,  called  Tertessos  by  the  Greeks  ;  and %0athe  Mountain  Calpe.  Then,  within  the  Shore,  the  Town %0aBarbesula,  with  the  River.  Also,  the  Town  Salbula ;  Suel- %0aMalacha,  with  the  River  of  the  Confederates.  Next  to  these, %0aMenoba,  with  a  River:  Sexi-firmum,  surnamed  Jiilium  : %0aSelaubina,  Abdera,  and  Murgis,  the  Frontier  of  Boetica.  All %0athat  Coast  M.  Agrippa  thought  to  have  had  their  Beginning %0afrom  the  Carthaginians  (Poeni).  From  Ana  there  lieth %0aagainst  the  Atlantic  Ocean,  the  Region  of  the  Bastuli  and %0athe  Turduli. %0a%0aM.  Varro  saith,  that  there  entered  into  all  Parts  of  Spain, %0athe  Iberians,  Persians,  Phoenicians,  Celts,  and  Carthaginians %0a(Posni)  :  for  Lusus,  the  Companion  of  Father  Liber,  or %0aLyssa,  (which  signifieth  the  frantic  Fury  of  those  that  raged %0awith  him),  gave  the  Name  to  Lusitania;  and  Pan  was  the %0aGovernor  of  it  all.  But  those  Things  which  are  reported  of %0aHercules  and  Perene,  or  of  Saturn,  I  think  to  be  fabulous %0a%0a1  These  rivers  are  now  called  Oilier  and  Tin  to. %0a%0a%0a154  History  of  Nature.

But  within  the  Jurisdiction  of %0aCorduba,  about  the  very  River  standeth  the  Town  Ossigi, %0awhich  is  surnamed  Laconicum  :  llliturgi,  called  also  Forum %0aJulium:  Ipasturgi,  the  same  as  Triumphal^  ;  Sitia  :  and  four- %0ateen Miles  within  the  Country,  Obulco,  which  is  named %0aPontificense\  And  presently  Ripepora.  a  Town  of  the  Con- %0afederates, Sacili,  Martialum,  Onoba.

Livy  tells  us  (lib.  xxv.  36),  that  "  Cneius %0aScipio,  according  to  some  accounts,  was  killed  on  the  hill,  in  the  first  as- %0asault :  according  to  others,  he  fled  into  a  castle  standing  near  the  camp  : %0athis  was  surrounded  with  fire,  and  the  doors,  which  were  too  strong  to  be %0aforced,  being  then  burned,  they  were  taken ;  and  all  within,  together  with %0athe  general  himself,  were  put  to  death."

The %0aTowns  of  the  Jurisdiction  Hispalensis  are  these  :  Celtica  Axa- %0atiara,  Arruci,  Menoba,  Ilipa,  surnamed  Italica.    And  on  the %0aleft  Hand,  Hispalis,  a  Colony,  surnamed  likewise  Romulensis. %0aOpposite  to  it,  the  Town  Osset,  which  is  also  called  Julia  Con- %0astantia:  Vergenturn,  which  also  is  JuliiGenitor;  Hippo  Caura- %0asiarum,  the  River  Menoba,  which  also  entereth  into  Bcetis  on %0athe  right  Side.     But  within  the  Estuaries  of  the  Boetis  there %0ais  the  Town  Nebrissa,  surnamed  Veneria  and  Colobona :  also %0aColonies,  as  Asta,  which  is  called  Regia.    And  in  the  midland %0aPart  Asido,  which  is  also  Caesariana.     The  River  Singulis %0abreaking  into  the  Boatis  in  the  order  I  have  said,  runneth %0aby  the  Colony  Astigitania,  surnamed  also  Augusta  Firma,  and %0aso  forward  it  is  navigable.  The  Rest  of  the  Colonies  belonging %0ato  this  Jurisdiction  are  free :  namely,  Tucci,  which  is  surnamed %0aAugusta  Gemella :    Itucci,  called  also  Virtus  Julia:  Attubi, %0acalled  Claritas  Julia  :  Urso,  which  is  Genua  Urbanorum  :  and %0aamong  these  was  Munda,  taken  together  with  Pompeys  Son. %0aFree  Towns,  Astigi  the  Old,  Ostippo.

Coming  from  the  Coast,  near  the  River %0aMenoba,  itself  navigable,  there  dwell  not  far  off  the  Alonti- %0agicili,  and  Alostigi.     But  this  Region,  which,  without  the %0aforenamed,  reacheth  from  the  Boetis  to  the  River  Ana,  is %0acalled  Beturia :  divided  into  two  Parts,  and  as  many  Sorts  of %0aPeople  :  the  Celtici,  who  border  on  Lusitania,  and  are  within %0athe  Jurisdiction  Hispalensis:  and  the  Turduli,  who  inhabit %0aclose  upon  Lusitania  and  Tarraconensis  :  and  they  resort  to %0aCorduba.     It  is  clear  that  the  Celtici  came  from  the  Celtibe- %0arians,  out   of  Lusitania,    as   appeareth   by   their   Religion, %0aTongue,  and  Names  of  Towns,  which  in  Bcetica  are  distin- %0aguished by  their  Surnames  ;  as  Seria,  which  is  called  Fama %0aJulia:  Ucultuniacum,  which  now  is  Curiga  :   Laconimurgi,. %0aConstantia  Julia ;  Terresibus  is  now  Fortunales  ;  and  Callen- %0asibus,  Emanici.

[BooK  III. %0a%0acount,  Arsa,  Mellaria,  and  Mirobrica:  and  the  Regions Osrutigi %0aand  Sisapone.  Within  the  Jurisdiction  of  Gades,  there  is  a %0aTown  of  Roman  Citizens  called  Regina :  of  Latins,  there  are %0aLaepia,  Ulia,  Carisa,  surnamed  Aurelia,  Urgia,  which  is  like- %0awise named  Castrurn  Julium :  also,  Csesaris  Salutariensis. %0aStipendiaries  there  be,  Besaro,  Belippo,  Berbesula,  Lacippo, %0aBesippo,  Callet,  Cappagum,  Oleastro,  Itucci,  Brana,  Lacibi, %0aSaguntia,  Andorisippo.  The  whole  Length  of  it  M .  Agrippa %0ahath  set  down  463  Miles,  and  the  Breadth  257.  But  because %0athe  Bounds  reached  to  Carthage,  which  Cause  occasioneth %0aoftentimes  Errors  in  computing  the  Measure  ;  at  one  Place %0ain  the  Limits  of  the  Provinces,  and  in  another  the  Paces  in %0ajourneying  being  either  more  or  less  ;  also,  considering  that %0athe  Seas  in  so  long  a  Time  have  encroached  here  upon  the %0aLand,  and  the  Banks  again  gotten  there  of  the  Sea  ;  or  that %0athe  Rivers  have  either  turned  crooked  or  gone  straight :  be- %0asides, that  some  have  begun  to  take  their  Measure  from  this %0aPlace,  others  from  that,  and  gone  divers  Ways  :  it  is  by  these %0aMeans  come  to  pass,  that  no  two  agree  together. %0a%0aCHAPTER  II. %0aThe  Length  and  Breadth  of  Bcetica. %0a%0aTHE  Length  of  Bcetica  at  this  day,  from  the  Bound  of  the %0aTown  Castulo  to  Gades,  is  475  Miles :  and  from  Murgi  on %0athe  Sea-coast,  more  by  twenty-two  Miles.  The  Breadth %0afrom  the  Border  of  Carteia  is  224  Miles.  And  who  would %0abelieve  that  Agrippa  (a  Man  so  diligent,  and  in  this  Work %0aprincipally  so  careful)  did  err,  when  he  purposed  to  set  out  a %0aView  of  the  whole  World  for  the  City,  and  Divus  Augustus %0awith  him  ?  For  he  finished  the  Portico  begun  according  to %0athe  Designation  and  Memorials  appointed  by  the  Sister  of %0aM.  Agrippa. %0a%0aCHAPTER   III. %0aThe  nearer  Spain. %0a%0aTHE  old  Form  of  the  nearer  Spain  is  somewhat  changed, %0aas  also  of  many  other  Provinces,  as  Pompey  the  Great  in  the %0a%0a%0aBOOK  III.]  History  of  Nature.  157 %0a%0aTrophies  which  he  erected  in  Pyrenaeus,  testifieth,  that %0a846  Towns  between  the  Alps  and  the  Borders  of  the  further %0aSpain,  were  by  him  brought  to  Obedience.  Now  the %0awhole  Province  is  divided  into  seven  Jurisdictions  :  the  Car- %0athaginian, the  Tarraconensian,  Caesar  Augustanian,  Cluni- %0aensian,  Asturian,  Lucensician,  and  of  Bracarum.  There  are %0abesides  Islands,  which  we  set  aside  without  naming  them, %0aand  excepting  the  Cities  that  are  annexed  to  others,  the %0aProvince  itself  containeth  294  Towns.  In  which  Colonies %0athere  be  twelve  Towns,  of  Roman  Citizens  thirteen,  of  old %0aLatins  seventeen,  of  Allies  one,  stipendiary  136.  The  first %0ain  the  Frontiers  be  the  Bastulians :  behind  them,  in  such %0aOrder  as  shall  be  said,  those  receding  Interiorly,  the  Men- %0atesani,  Oretani,  and  the  Carpetani,  upon  the  River  Tagus. %0aNear  to  them,  the  Vaccaei,  Vectones,  Celtiberi,  and  Arrebaci. %0aThe  Towns  next  to  the  Borders,  Urci  and  Barea,  assigned  to %0aBcetica  :  the  Country  of  Mauritania,  then  Deitania :  after %0athat,  Contestania,  and  New  Carthage,  a  Colony.  From  the %0aPromontory  of  which,  called  Saturn  s  Cape,  the  Passage %0aover  the  Sea  to  Caesaries,  a  City  in  Mauritania,  is  187  Miles. %0aIn  the  residue  of  that  Coast  is  the  River  Tader  :  the  Free %0aColony  Illici,  of  which  the  Bay  took  the  name  Illicitanus. %0aTo  it  are  annexed  the  Icositani :  soon  after,  Lucentum,  a %0aTown  of  the  Latins.  Dranium,  a  Stipendiary  ;  the  River %0aSucro,  and  what  was  sometime  the  Frontier  Town  of  Con- %0atestania. The  Region  Edetania,  which  retireth  to  the  Cel- %0atiberians,  having  a  pleasant  Pool  bordering  along  the  Front %0aof  it.

But  in %0athe    Borders,    the    Colony    Barcino,    surnamed    Faventia : %0aTowns  of  Roman  Citizens, — Baetulo,  Illuro,  the  River  Lar- %0anum,  Blandee :  the  River  Alba,  Emporiae:  two  there  be  of %0athese,    of  the  old   Inhabitants,  and   of  Greeks,  who  were %0adescended  from  the  Phocaeans.      The  River   Tichis;    from %0awhence  to  Pyrenaea  Venus  on  the  other  side  of  the  Pro- %0amontory, are  forty  Miles.      Now,   besides   the  forenamed, %0ashall  be  related  the  principal  places  as  they  lie  in  every %0aJurisdiction.     At  Tarracon  there  plead  in  Court  four  and %0aforty  States.     The  most  famous  among  them  are,  of  Roman %0aCitizens,  the  Dertusani   and  Bisgargitani  :    of  Latins,  the %0aAusetani  and  Cerretani,  surnamed  Juliani :  they  also  who %0aare  named    Augustani,    the   Sedetani,    Gerundenses,    Ges- %0asorienses,  Teari,  the  same  with  Julienses.     Of  Stipendiarii, %0athe  Aquicaldenses,  Onenses,  and  Baetulonenses.     Caesar  Au- %0agusta, a  free  Colony,  upon  which  the  River  Iberus  floweth, %0awhere  the  Town  before  was  called  Salduba :    these  are  of %0athe  Region  Sedetania,  and  receiveth  152  States,  and  among %0athese,  of  Roman  Citizens,  the  Bellitani  and  Celsenses  ;  and %0aout  of  the  Colony,  the  Calaguritani,  surnamed  also  Nascici. %0aThe   Ilerdenses   of  the   Surdaon's    Nation,   near   to   whom %0arunneth  the  River  Sicoris  :  the  Oscences,  of  the  Region  Ves- %0acetania,  and  the  Turiasonenses.

The  Setabitani,  who  are  also  Au- %0agustani,  and  the  Valerrienses.  But  of  the  Stipendiarii,  of %0agreatest  name  be  the  Babanenses,  the  Bastiani,  the  Con- %0asaburenses,  Dianenses,  Egelestani,  Ilorcitani,  Laminitani, %0aMentesani,  the  same  as  Oritani ;  arid  Mentesani,  who  other- %0awise are  Bastuli ;  Oretani,  who  also  are  called  Germani ; %0athe  Chief  of  the  Celtiberians,  the  Segobrigenses,  and  the %0aToletani  of  Carpetania,  dwelling  upon  the  River  Tagus  : %0anext  to  them,  the  Viacienses  and  Virgilienses.  To  the  Juris- %0adiction of  Cluniensis  the  Varduli  bring  fourteen  Nations,  of %0awhich  it  is  necessary  to  name  none  but  the  Albanenses ; %0athe  Turmodigi  four,  among  whom  are  the  Segisamonenses, %0aSagisainejulienses.  To  the  same  Jurisdiction  the  Carietes %0aand  the  Vennenses  go  out  of  five  Cities,  of  which  the  Ve- %0alienses  are.  Thither  repair  the  Pelendones,  with  four  States %0aof  the  Celtiberians,  of  whom  the  Numantini  were  famous ; %0aas  in  the  eighteen  Cities  of  the  Vaccsei.  the  Intercatienses, %0aPallantini,  Lacobricenses,  and  Caucenses:  for  in  the  four %0aStates  of  the  Cantabrici  only  Juliobrica  is  named.  In  the %0aten  Cities  of  the  Autrigoni,  Tritium  and  Vironesca.  To %0athe  Arevaci  the  River  Areva  gave  name.  Of  them  there  be %0aseven  Towns  :  Saguntia  and  Uxama,  which  Names  are  often %0aused  in  other  Places  ;  besides  Segovia  and  Nova  Augusta, %0aTermes,  and  Clunia  itself,  the  very  utmost  bound  of  Cel- %0atiberia.  All  the  rest  lie  toward  the  Ocean ;  and  of  the %0aabove-named,  the  Verduli,  together  with  the  Cantabri.  To %0athese  there  are  joined  twelve  Nations  of  the  Astures,  divided %0ainto  the  Augustanes  and  Transmontani,  having  a  stately %0aCity,  Asturica.  Among  these  are  Giguri,  Pesici,  Lancienses, %0aand  Zoclae.  The  number  of  the  whole  Multitude  ariseth  to %0a240,000  Polls  of  free  Men.  The  Jurisdiction  Lucensis  com- %0apriseth  sixteen  Nations  (besides  the  Celtici  and  Lebuni)  of %0abase  Condition,  and  having  barbarous  Names  ;  but  of  Free- %0amen, almost  166,000.  In  like  manner,  twenty-four  Cities, %0ahaving  275,000  Polls  of  Bracari;  of  whom,  besides  the %0aBracari  themselves,  the  Vibali,  Celerini,  Galleeci,  ^Equesilici, %0a%0a%0a1 60  History  of  Nature.

The %0alength  of  the  hither  Spain,  from  Pyrenaeus  to  the  Bound  of %0aCastulo,  is  607  Miles,  and  the  Coast  thereof  somewhat  more. %0aThe  Breadth  from  Tarracon  to  the  Shore  of  Alarson,  307 %0aMiles ;  and  from  the  Foot  of  Pyrenseus  where,  between  two %0aSeas,  it  is  Pointed  with  the  Straits,  and  so  opening  itself %0aby  little  and  little  until  it  come  to  touch  the  farther  Spain, %0ait  is  as  much,  and  addeth  somewhat  more  to  the  Breadth. %0aAll  Spain  is  full  of  Metal,  as  Lead,  Iron,  Copper,  Silver, %0aand  Gold  :  the  hither  part  thereof  aboundeth  with  Specular %0aStone,1  and  Bostica,  particularly,  with  Vermillion.  There %0aare  also  Quarries  of  Marble.  Unto  all  Spain,  Vespasianus %0aAugustus,  the  Emperor,  tossed  with  the  Tempests  of  the %0aCommonwealth,  granted  the  Franchises  of  Latium.  The %0aMountains  Pyreuaei  define  the  Boundaries  of  Spain  and  Gaul, %0atheir  Promontories  projecting  into  two  opposite  Seas. %0a%0aCHAPTER  IV. %0aThe  Province  Narbonensis. %0a%0aTHAT  Part  of  Gallia  which  is  washed  by  the  Mediter- %0aranean Sea  is  called  the  Province  Narbonensis,  named  for- %0amerly Braccata  ;  divided  from  Italy  by  the  River  Varus  and %0athe  Alps,  most  Friendly  Mountains  to  the  Roman  Empire ; %0aand  from  the  other  Parts  of  Gaul,  on  the  North  side,  by  the %0aMountains  Gehenna  and  Jura.

The  Rivers  be %0aTecurn  and  Vernodubrum  ;  the  Towns,  llliberis  (a  poor %0arelic  of  a  City  that  was  once  Great),  and  Ruscio,  inhabited %0aby  the  Latins.

Also,  where  Rhoda %0aof  the  Rhodians  was,  whereof  Rhodanus  took  its  name,  the %0amost  fruitful  River  of  all  Gallia,  running  swiftly  out  of  the %0aAlps  through  the  Lake  Lemanus,  and  carrying  with  it %0athe  slow  Araris  ;  and  Isara  running  as  fast  as  itself, %0atogether  with  Druentia  ;  of  which  the  two  small  Mouths  are %0acalled  Lybica;  of  which  the  one  is  Hispaniensum,  the  other %0aMetapinum  :  there  is  a  third,  which  is  the  most  Wide %0aand  Large,  named  Massalioticum.  Some  write  that  the %0aTown  Heraclea  likewise  stood  at  the  Mouth  of  Rhodanus. %0aBeyond  the  Ditch,  out  of  Rhodanus,  which  was  the  Work %0aof  C.  Marius  and  beareth  his  Name,  there  was  remarkable %0aPool ;  moreover,  the  Town  Astromela,  and  the  maritime %0aTract  of  the  Avsetici ;  and  above,  the  stony  Plains,  the  Me- %0amorial of  the  Battles  of  Hercules.

After  it  is  the  maritime  Country %0aof  the  Volscians,  and  Campania  :  then  Picentium,  Lu- %0acanum,  and  Brutium,  the  furthest  Point  in  the  South,  to %0awhich,  from  the  moonshaped  Mountains  of  the  Alps,  Italy %0ashooteth  out  to  the  Seas.  From  it  is  the  Sea-coast  of %0aGraecia,  and  soon  after,  the  Salentini,  Pediculi,  Apuli, %0aPeligni,  Ferentani,  Marrucini,  Vestini,  Sabini,  Picentes, %0aGalli,  Urnbri,  Tusci,  Veneti,  Carni,  lapides,  Istri,  and %0aLiburni. %0a%0aNeither  am  I  ignorant  that  it  might  be  thought  justly  a %0apoint  of  an  unthankful  and  stupid  Mind,  if  briefly  in  this %0asort,  and  cursorily,  that  Land  should  be  spoken  of  which  is %0athe  Nurse  of  all  Lands.  She  also  is  the  Mother,  chosen  by %0athe  Power  of  the  Gods,  to  make  even  Heaven  itself  more %0aGlorious  ;  to  gather  into  One  the  scattered  Empires,  to %0asoften  the  Fashions  of  other  Countries ;  and  whereas  the %0a%0a%0aBOOK  III.]  History  of  Nature.  163 %0a%0aLanguages  of  so  many  Nations  were  repugnant  and  savage, %0ato  draw  them  together  by  commerce  of  Speech,  to  a  Con- %0aference;  to  endue  Man  with  Humanity;  and  briefly,  that  of %0aall  Nations  in  the  World  there  should  be  one  only  Country. %0aBut  so  noble  are  all  the  Places  that  a  Man  shall  come  to, %0aso  excellent  is  every  thing,  and  each  State  so  famous,  that  I %0aam  at  a  loss  what  to  say.  The  City  of  Rome,  the  only  fair %0aFace  therein  worthy  to  stand  upon  so  stately  a  Neck,  what %0aWork  would  it  ask  to  be  described  as  it  ought l  ?  The  very %0aTract  of  Campania  by  itself,  so  pleasant  and  happy,  how %0ashould  it  be  described?  So  that  it  is  evident  in  this  one %0aPlace  there  is  the  Work  of  rejoicing  Nature.  Besides  this, %0athe  whole  Temperature  of  the  Air  is  evermore  so  vital,  the %0aFields  so  fertile,  the  Hills  so  open  to  the  Sun,  the  Forests %0aso  harmless,  the  Groves  so  shady,  the  kinds  of  Wood  so %0abounteous,  the  Mountains  so  breezy ;  the  Corn,  the  Vines, %0athe  Olives  so  fertile  ;  the  Sheep  so  enriched  with  such  noble %0aFleeces.;  such  Necks  to  the  Oxen ;  so  many  Lakes,  such %0aabundance  of  Rivers  and  Springs  watering  it  throughout ;  so %0amany  Seas  and  Havens,  that  it  is  the  very  Bosom  lying  open %0ato  receive  the  Commerce  of  all  Lands ;  and  as  of  itself %0aearnestly  desiring  to  lie  far  into  the  Sea  to  help  all  Mankind. %0aNeither  do  I  speak  now  of  the  Natures  and  Manners  of  the %0aMen ;  nor  of  the  Nations  subdued  by  their  Tongue  and %0aHand.  Even  the  Greeks  (a  Nation  of  all  other  most  given %0ato  praise  themselves)  have  given  their  judgment  of  her,  in %0athat  they  called  a  certain  Part  thereof  Great  Greece.

[BooK  III. %0a%0awe  do  in  this  Part :  only  I  pray  the  Readers  to  remember %0athat  I  hasten  to  rehearse  every  particular  Thing  through %0athe  whole  Globe. %0a%0aItaly  is  fashioned  like  to  an  Oak  leaf,  being  much  larger %0ain  Length  than  in  Breadth:  to  the  left  Side  bending  with %0athe  Top,  and  ending  in  the  Figure  of  an  Amazonian  Shield  : %0aand  where,  from  the  middle  Extension,  it  is  called  Cocin- %0athos,  it  putteth  forth  through  two  moonshaped  Promontories %0atwo  Horns :  the  one,  Leucopetra,  on  the  right  Hand ;  the  other, %0aLacinium,  on  the  left.  In  Length  it  reacheth  from  the  Foot %0aof  the  Alps  to  Prsetoria  Augusta,  through  the  City  of  Rome, %0aand  so  to  Capua,  with  a  course  leading  to  Rhegium,  a  Town %0asituated  upon  the  Shoulder  thereof:  from  which  beginneth %0athe  bending,  as  it  were,  of  the  Neck,  and  beareth  1020 %0aMiles.  And  this  Measure  would  be  much  more  if  it  went %0aas  far  as  Lacinium  ;  but  such  an  Obliquity  might  seem  to %0adecline  out  too  much  to  one  Side.  Its  Breadth  is  various  ; %0abeing  410  Miles  between  the  two  Seas,  the  Higher  and %0athe  Lower,  and  the  Rivers  Varus  and  Arsia.  The  middle %0aportions  of  this  Breadth,  which  is  much  about  the  City  of %0aRome,  from  the  Mouth  of  the  River  Aternus  running  into %0athe  Adriatic  Sea,  unto  the  Mouths  of  Tiber,  136  Miles;  and %0asomewhat  less  from  Novum  Castrum  by  the  Adriatic  Sea,  to %0aAlsium,  and  so  to  the  Tuscan  Sea :  and  in  no  Place  ex- %0aceedeth  it  in  Breadth  300  Miles.  But  the  full  Compass  of %0athe  whole,  from  Varus  to  Arsia,  is  20,049  Miles.  It  is %0adistant  by  Sea  from  the  Lands  round  about,  that  is,  from %0aIstria  and  Liburnia,  in  some  Places  100  Miles;  from  Epirus %0aand  Illyricuni,  50  Miles  ;  from  Africa,  less  than  200,  as  Varro %0aaffirmeth  ;  from  Sardinia,  120  Miles  ;  from  Sicily,  a  Mile  and %0aa  half ;  from  Corey ra,  less  than  70  ;  from  tssa,  50.  It  goeth %0aalong  the  Seas  even  to  the  Meridional  Line  of  the  Heaven ; %0abut  if  a  Man  examine  it  very  exactly,  it  lieth  between  the %0aSun-rising  in  Mid-winter,  and  the  Point  of  the  Meridian. %0a%0aNow  we  will  describe  the  Circuit  of  this  Country,  and %0areckon  the  Cities :  wherein  it  is  necessary  to  be  premised, %0athat  we  shall  follow  our  Author  Divus  Augustus,  and  the %0aDescription  by  him  made  of  all  Italy  ;  arranged  into  eleven %0a%0a%0aBOOK  III.]  History  of  Nature.  1 65 %0a%0aRegions.  The  Maritime  Towns  I  will  set  down  in  the  order %0aas  they  stand,  according  to  their  vicinity  one  to  another. %0aBut  as  in  so  running  a  Speech,  the  rest  cannot  be  so %0aorderly  described,  therefore  in  the  Inland  part  thereof  I %0awill  follow  him  as  he  hath  digested  them  in  Letters,  but %0amentioning  the  Colonies  by  Name  which  he  hath  delivered %0ain  that  number.  Neither  is  it  easy  to  follow  thoroughly %0atheir  Positions  and  Origins,  considering  the  Ingaun  Li- %0agurians  (to  say  nothing  of  all  the  rest)  were  endowed  with %0aLands  thirty  times.  To  begin  with  the  River  Varus,  there- %0afore, there  is  the  Town  Nicsea,  built  by  the  Massilians ;  the %0aRiver  Po ;  the  Alps  ;  the  People  within  the  Alps,  of  many %0aNames,  but  chiefly  the  Capillati :  the  Town  Vediantiorum, %0athe  City  Cemelion  (or  a  Town  belonging  to  the  State  of  the %0aVedianti,  called  Cemelion) ;  the  Port  of  Hercules  Monoscus  ; %0athe  Ligustian  Coast.  Of  the  Liguri,  the  most  renowned %0abeyond  the  Alps  are  the  Sally i,  Deceates,  and  Oxubii :  on %0athis  Side,  the  Veneni,  and,  descended  from  the  Caturiges, %0athe  Vagienni,  Statilli,  Vibelli,  Magelli,  Euburiates,  Cas- %0amonates,  Veliates,  and  those  whose  Towns  we  will  declare %0ain  the  next  Coast.  The  River  Rutuba,  the  Town  Albium, %0aIntemelium,  the  River  Merula,  the  Town  Albium  Ingaunum, %0athe  Port  Vadum  Sabatium,  the  River  Porcifera,  the  Town %0aGenua,  the  River  Feritor ;  the  Port  Delphini,  Tigulia : %0awithin,  Segesta  Tiguliorum  :  the  River  Macra,  which  limiteth %0aLiguria.

What- %0aever Land,  therefore,  above  ten  Miles'  compass,  lieth  near %0aabout  it,  hath  been  annexed  to  the  Island.  A  year  after %0athat  another  wonderful  Thing  fell  out  in  It%3csly  :  for  not  far %0afrom  Circeii  there  is  a  Pond  called  Pomptina,  which  Mu- %0atianusy  a  Man  who  had  been  thrice  Consul,  reporteth  to  have %0abeen  a  Place  wherein  stood  twenty-three  Cities.  Then  there %0ais  the  River  Ufens,  upon  which  is  the  Town  Terracina, %0acalled  in  the  Volscian  tongue  Anxur,  and  where  was  the  City %0aAioycle,  destroyed  by  Serpents.  After  it  is  the  Place  of  a %0a%0a1  Cerceia  was  a  town  of  the  Volsci,  on  whose  ruins  is  now  built  the %0alittle  village  Santa  Felicita.  Homer  ("  Odyssey,"  K.  194)  represents  it %0aas  the  abode  of  Circe,  and  says  it  was  an  island — %0a%0a"  An  isle  encircled  with  the  boundless  flood." %0a%0aBut  the  country  all  around  is  now  one  vast  plain,  and  constitutes  the  well- %0aknown  Pontine  Marshes,  which  being  raised  but  little  above  the  level  of %0athe  sea,  may  not  improbably  have  been  once  covered  by  its  waves.

The  furthest  Town  in  the  adjoins  of  Latium %0ais  Sinuessa,  which,  as  some  have  said,  was  commonly  called %0aSinope.

From  hence  the  Setine  and  Ce- %0acubine  Countries  spread  forth  :  and  to  them  join  the  Falern %0aand  Calene.  Then  arise  the  Mountains  Massici,  Gaurani, %0aand  Surrentim.

And  that  the  enemies  of  Rome  might  not  have  recourse  to  the %0asame  expedient,  it  was  kept ; a  strict  secret  under  the  protection  of  what %0aparticular  deity  their  own  city  was  placed.  Valentia  appears  to  have  been %0athe  secret  name,  and  it  was  never  divulged  till  Valerius  Soranus  rashly %0auttered  it,  and,  as  we  learn  from  Plutarch  (in  "  Quaest.  Rom."  p.  278), %0auffered  the  punishment  of  his  impiety.  St.  Paul  found  at  Athens  an %0a%0a%0aBOOK  III.]  History  of  Nature.  171 %0a%0acounted  in  the  Mysteries  of  the  Ceremonies  an  impious  and %0aunlawful  Thing  :  which,  after  it  was  abolished,  for  the  faithful %0aSafety  thereof,  Valerius  Soranus  pronounced,  and  soon  after %0asuffered  the  Penalty.  I  think  it  not  amiss  to  insert  in  this %0aPlace  an  Example  of  the  ancient  Religion,  instituted  espe- %0acially for  this  Silence:  for  the  Goddess  Angerona,  to  whom %0ais  sacrificed  on  the  twelfth  Day  before  the  Kalends  of  January, %0ais  represented  by  an  Image  having  her  Mouth  bound  and %0asealed  up.  The  City  had  three  Gates  when  Romulus  left  it ; %0aor  rather  four  (if  we  believe  most  Men  that  write  thereof), %0aits  Walls,  when  the  two  Vespasians,  Emperors  and  Censors, %0atook  the  Measure,  in  the  Year  after  the  Foundation  of  it, %0a828,  were  in  circuit  thirteen1  Miles  and  almost  a  quarter. %0aIt  containeth  within  it  seven  Mountains,  and  is  divided  into %0afourteen  Regions  and  265  cross  Streets,  called  Compita %0aLarium.  The  Measure  of  the  same  space  of  Ground,  running %0afrom  the  Milliarium,  erected  at  the  Head  of  the  Roman %0aForum,  to  every  Gate,  which  are  at  this  Day  thirty-seven  in %0anumber  (so  ye  reckon  once  the  twelve  Gates  always  open, %0aand  overpass  seven  of  the  old,  which  no  longer  exist2),  maketh %0athirty  Miles,  three-quarters,  and  a  little  more,  in  a  straight %0aLine :  but  from  the  same  Milliarium  3,  to  the  utmost  ends  of %0athe  Houses,  with  the  Praetorian  Camps,  and  the  clumps %0a(vicos)  of  all  the  Streets,  it  cometh  to  somewhat  above %0aseventy  Miles  :  to  which  if  a  Man  put  the  Height  of  the %0aHouses,  he  may  truly  conceive  by  it  a  worthy  Estimate  of  it, %0aand  confess  that  the  Magnitude  of  no  City  in  the  World %0a%0aaltar  dedicated  to  the  Unknown  God;  this  had,  probably,  been  erected %0awith  a  reference  to  the  custom  above-mentioned,  as  there  is  no  reason  for %0asupposing  it  confined  to  the  Romans. —  Wern.

The  Promontory  Palinurum, %0aCreek  receding,  from  which  there  is  a  Passage  to  the  Column %0aRhegia,  100  Miles  over.  Next  to  this,  the  River  Melphes  : %0athe  Town  Buxentum,  in  Greek  Pyxus;  the  River  Laiis  ; %0aand  a  Town  there  was  likewise  of  the  same  Name.  From %0athence  the  Sea-coast  of  Brutium,  the  Town  Blanda,  the %0aRiver  Batnm,  the  Haven  Parthenius  belonging  to  the %0aPhocaeans  :  the  Bay  Vibonensis ;  the  Grove  Clampetia,  the %0aTown  Ternsa,  called  by  the  Greeks  Temese :  and  Terina  of %0athe  Crotonians,  and  the  very  large  Bay  Terinseus  :  the  Town %0aConsentia.  Within,  in  a  Peninsula,  the  River  Acheron, %0afrom  which  the  Townsmen  are  called  Acherontini.  Hippo, %0awhich  now  we  call  Vibovalentia  ;  the  Port  of  Hercules,  the %0aRiver  Metaurus,  the  Town  Tauroentum,  the  Port  of  Orestes, %0aand  Medua  :  the  Town  Scylleum,  the  River  Cratais,  Mother %0a(as  they  say)  to  Scylla.  Then  the  Column  Rhegia :  the %0aSicilian  Straits,  and  two  Capes,  one  over  against  the  other ; %0anamely,  Caenis  from  Italy,  and  Pelorum  from  Sicily,  a  Mile %0aand  half  asunder  :  from  whence  to  Rhegium  is  twelve  Miles %0aand  a  half:  and  so  forward  to  a  Wood  in  the  Apennine %0acalled  Sila  ;  and  the  Promontory  called  Leucopetra,  twelve %0aMiles.  Beyond  which,  Locri  (carrying  the  Name  also  of  the %0aPromontory  Zephyrium)  is  from  Silarus  distant  303  Miles. %0aHere  is  included  the  first  Gulf  of  Europe,  wherein  are  named %0athese  Seas :  first,  Atlanticum  (from  which  the  Ocean  breaketh %0ain),  called  of  some  Magnum  :  the  Passage  through  which  it %0aentereth  is  by  the  Greeks  called  Porthmos;  by  us  FretumGadi- %0atanum ;  when  it  hath  entered  the  Spanish  Sea,  so  far  it  washeth %0athe  Coasts  of  Spain,  Freturn  Hispanum  :  of  others,  Ibericum, %0aor  Balearicum :  and  presently  it  taketh  the  Name  of  Gallicum, %0abefore  the  Province  Narbonensis  :  and  after  that,  Ligusticum : %0afrom  whence,  to  the  Island  Sicily,  it  is  called  Tuscum  ;  which %0asome  of  the  Grecians  term  Notium,  others  Tyrrhenum,  but %0amost  of  our  Countrymen  Inferum.

[BooK  III. %0a%0aSalentini,  Polybius  calleth  it  Ausonium  :  but  Eratosthenes %0anaraeth  all  the  Sea  Sardonuin,  that  is,  between  the  Mouth  of %0athe  Ocean  and  Sardinia  :  and  from  thence  to  Sicily,  Tyr- %0arhenum  :  and  from  it  to  Greta,  Siculum  :  beyond  which  it  is %0acalled  Creticum.  The  Islands  along  these  Seas  are  these  : %0athe  first  of  all,  those  by  the  Greeks  named  Pityusae,  of  the %0aPine  plant ;  but  now,  Ebusus :  they  are  both  a  City  con- %0afederate, and  a  narrow  Arm  of  the  Sea  runneth  between %0athem  :  they  are  forty-two  Miles  apart.  From  Dianeum  they %0aare  distant  seventy  Stadia :  and  so  many  are  there  between %0aDianeum  and  New  Carthage,  by  the  main  Land  :  and  as  far %0afrom  Pityusse  into  the  main  Ocean,  lie  the  two  Baleares ; %0aand  toward  Sucro,  Colubraria.  These  Baleares,  in  War, %0ause  much  the  Sling  ;  and  the  Greeks  name  them  Gymnesiae. %0aThe  greater  of  them  is  100  Miles  in  Length,  and  in  Circuit %0a380.  It  hath  Towns  of  Roman  Citizens,  Palma  and  Pol- %0alentia :  of  Latins,  Cinium  and  Cunici :  and  Bochri  was  a %0aTown  confederate.  From  it  the  lesser  is  30  Miles  off, %0abeing  in  Length  60  Miles,  and  in  Compass  150.  Cities %0ain  it  are  Jamno,  Sanisera,  and  Mago.  From  the  greater, %0a12  Miles  in  the  Sea,  lieth  the  Isle  Capraria,  dangerous  for %0aShipwrecks :  and  opposite  the  City  Palma,  Menariae,  and %0aTiquadra,  and  little  Annibalis.  The  Soil  of  Ebusus  chaseth %0aSerpents  away,  but  that  of  Colubraria  breedeth  them ;  and %0atherefore  it  is  Dangerous  for  all  that  come  into  it,  unless  they %0abring  with  them  some  of  the  Ebusian  earth.  The  Greeks %0acall  this  Island,  Ophiusa.  Neither  doth  Ebusus  produce %0aany  Rabbits ;  which  are  so  common  in  the  Baleares,  that %0athey  eat  up  the  Corn.  There  be  about  twenty  more  little %0aones  in  the  shallow  Part  of  the  Sea.  But  in  the  Coast  of %0aGallia,  in  the  Mouth  of  Rhodanus,  there  is  Metina  ;  and %0asoon  after,  that  which  is  called  Blascon  ;  and  the.  three %0aStoechades,  called  so  by  their  Neighbours  the  Massilians,  for %0atheir  Order ;  and  they  give  each  one  a  several  Name,  as %0aProte,  Mes£  (which  also  is  called  Pornponiana),  and  the %0athird,  Hypea.  After  them,  are  Sturium,  Phrenice,  Phila, %0aLero,  and  Lerina,  over  against  Antipolis;  wherein  is  a %0aMemorial  of  the  Town  Vergaonum. %0a%0a%0aBOOK  III.]  History  of  Nature.  1 75 %0a%0aCHAPTER  VI. %0a%0ai %0aOf  Corsica. %0a%0aIN  the  Ligurian  Sea  is  Corsica,  which  the  Greeks  called %0aCyrnos,  but  it  is  nearer  to  the  Tuscan  Sea,  stretching  out %0afrom  the  North  into  the  South,  and  in  Length  is  150  Miles : %0ain  Breadth,  for  the  more  Part,  50:  in  Circuit,  322:  it  is %0adistant  from  the  Shallows  of  Volaterrae  62  Miles.  It  hath %0a35  Cities  :  and  the  Colonies,  Mariana,  planted  by  C.  Marius; %0aAleria,  by  the  Dictator  Sylla.  On  this  Side  of  it  is  Oglasa ; %0abut  within  60  Miles  of  Corsica  is  Planaria ;  so  called  of  its %0aForm,  which  is  level  with  the  Sea;  and,  therefore,  deceiveth %0aShips.  Bigger  than  it  are  Urgo  and  Capraria,  which  the %0aGreeks  called  .ZEgilos.  Also,  ^Egilium  and  Danium,  the %0asame  as  Artemisia ;  both  lying  over  against  the  Coast  of %0aCosanum.  Other  small  ones,  also,  as  Maenaria,  Columbraria, %0aVenaria,  Ilua,  with  the  Iron  Mines,  in  Circuit  100  Miles, %0a10  Miles  from  Populonia,  called  by  the  Greeks,  .ZEthalia : %0afrom  it  is  Planasia,  39  Miles  off.  After  them,  beyond  the %0aMouths  of  Tiber  in  the  Antian  (Creek),  is  Astura;  and  close %0aby  Palmaria,  Sinonia  ;  and  just  against,  Formias,  Pontiae. %0aBut  in  the  Bay  of  Puteolanum,  Pantadaria  and  Prochyta,  so %0acalled,  not  of  jEneass  Nurse,  but  because  of  the  gushing  of %0athe  Sea  from  JEnaria.  ^Enaria  itself  took  its  Name  from  the %0aStation  of  the  Ships  of  uEneas  ;  called  by  Homer  Inarime,  by %0athe  Greeks,  Pithecusa;  not  for  the  Number  of  Apes  there,  as %0asome  have  thought,  but  of  the  Work-houses  of  those  that %0amade  earthen  Vessels.  Between  Pausilipus  and  Naples,  Me- %0agaris ;  and  soon  after,  eight  Miles  from  Surrentum,  Capreae, %0arenowned  for  the  Castle  of  the  Prince  Tiberius  ;  in  Circum- %0aference 400  Miles.  Next,  Leucothea;  and  out  of  Sight  Jieth %0aSardinia,  close  upon  the  African  Sea,  but  less  than  nine  Miles %0afrom  the  Coast  of  Corsica :  and  still  those  Straits  are  made %0amore  narrow  by  reason  of  the  small  Islands  named  Cunicu- %0alarise.  Likewise  Phintonis  and  Fossae,  whereof  the  very %0aStrait  itself  is  named  Taphros. %0a%0a%0a1 76  History  of  Nature.  [ BOOK  III. %0a%0aCHAPTER  VII. %0aOf  Sardinia. %0a%0aSARDINIA,  on  the  East  Side,  is  in  Extent  188  Miles;  on %0athe  West,  170  ;  Southward,  74;  and  Northward,  122  :  so  that, %0ain  all,  it  taketh  up  the  Compass  of  560  Miles.  It  is  from  the %0aCape  of  Caralitanus  to  Africa  200  Miles :  from  Gades,  1400 %0aMiles.  It  hath  two  Islands  on  that  Side  where  the  Promon- %0atory Gorditanum  standeth  ;  which  be  called  Hercules'  Is- %0alands :  on  the  Side  of  Sulsensis,  Enosis  ;  of  Caralitanum, %0aFicaria.  Some  Place  not  far  from  it  the  Islands  Belerides %0aand  Col  1  odes :  and  another  which  they  call  Heras  Lutra,  or %0aHieraca.  The  most  celebrated  People  therein  are  the  Ilienses, %0aBalari,  and  Corsi :  and  of  the  fourteen  Towns,  the  Sul- %0acitana,  Valentin),  Neapolitan!,  Bosenses,  and  Caralitani,  who %0aare  Roman  Citizens  ;  arid  Norenses.  There  is  one  Colony %0awhich  is  called  Ad  Turrim  Libysonis.  This  Island  Sardinia %0aTimceus  called  (from  the  Shape  of  a  Shoe)  Sandaliotis :  but %0aMyrsylus  (from  its  Resemblance  to  a  Footstep),  Ichnusa. %0aOver  against  the  Bay  Psestanum  is  Leucasia,  so  called  from %0aa  Siren  there  buried.  Opposite  Vestia,  lie  Pontia  and  Issia  ; %0aboth  jointly  called  by  one  Name,  (Enotides  ;  an  Argument %0athat  Italy  was  possessed  by  the  CEnotrians.  And  opposite %0aVibo  other  little  ones,  called  Ithacesise,  the  Watch-places  of %0aUlysses. %0a%0aCHAPTER  VIII. %0aOf  Sicily. %0a%0aBUT  Sicily  excelleth  all  other  of  these  Islands.  It  is %0anamed  by  Thucydides,  Sicania ;  by  many,  Trinacria,  or  Tri- %0aquetra,  from  its  triangular  Form.  It  is  in  Circuit  (as  Agrippa %0asaith)  198  Miles.  In  Times  past  it  was  joined  to  the  Bru- %0atians'  Country ;  but  soon  after,  by  the  Rush  of  the  Sea,  it %0awas  torn  from  it,  and  a  Strait  was  left  of  12  Miles  in %0aLength,  and  one  and  a  half  in  Breadth,  near  the  Column %0aRhegium.  Upon  this  Occasion  of  opening,  the  Greeks  gave %0aa  Name  to  the  Town  Rhegiurn,  situated  on  the  Edge  sf  Italy. %0a%0a%0aBOOK  III.]  History  of  Nature.  177 %0a%0aIn  this  Strait  is  the  Rock  called  Scylla,  and  likewise  another %0anamed  Charybdis :  the  Sea  is  full  of  Whirlpools,  and  both %0athose  Rocks  are  notorious  for  their  Rage.     The  utmost  Cape %0aof  this  Island  Triquetra  (as  we  have  said)  is  called  Pelorus, %0aprojecting  against  Scylla  toward  Italy.     Pachynum  lieth  to- %0award Graecia,  and  from  it  Peloponnesus  is  distant  144  Miles. %0aLilybaeum  lieth  toward  Africa,  and  between  it  and  the  Cape %0aof  Mercury  there  are  180  Miles  :  and  from  the  said  Lilybaeum %0ato  the  Cape  of  Caraleis  in  Sardinia,  120.     Now  these  Pro- %0amontories and  Sides  lie  one  from  the  other  at  this  Distance : %0aby  Land,  from  Pelorus  to  Pachynum,  166  Miles  :  from  thence %0ato  Lilybaeum,  200  Miles :  so  forward  to  Pelorus,  170.     In  it, %0aof  Colonies,  Towns,    and    Cities,    there   are   72.      Beyond %0aPelorus,  which  looketh  toward  the  Ionian  Sea,  is  the  Town %0aMessana,  inhabited  by  Roman  Citizens,  which  are  called %0aMamertini.      Also  the  Cape  Drepanum  ;  the  Colony  Tau- %0arominium,  formerly   called  Naxos;  the   River  Asines;   the %0aMountain  ^Etna,  wonderful  for  its  Fires  in  the  Night ;  the %0aCavity  (Crater)  of  it  is  in  Compass  two  Miles  and  a  half; %0athe  burning  Ashes  thereof  fly  as  far  as  to  Taurominium  and %0aCatana :  but  its  crashing  Noise  may  be  heard  as  far  as  to %0aMaron,  and  the  Hills  Gemellis.     There  are  also,  the  three %0aRocks   of  the  Cyclops ;    the    Port  of  Ulysses,  the   Colony %0aCatana ;  the  Rivers  Symethum  and  Terias :  within  the  Isle %0athe  Fields  Laestrigonii.     The  Towns  Leontini  and  Megaris  : %0athe  River  Pantagies  :  the  Colony  Syracusae,  with  the  Foun- %0atain Arethusa.   Also,  there  are  other  Springs  in  the  Territory %0aof  Syracusa  that  yield  Water  for  drink,  as  Temenitis,  Archi- %0ademia,    Magaea,    Cyan£,   and   Milichie.

But  on  this  Side  Sicily,  opposite  the %0aRiver  Metaurus,  about  12  Miles  from  Italy,  seven  others %0acalled  JEoliae.  The  same  Islands  belonged  to  the  Liparaei, %0aand  by  the  Greeks  were  called  Hephaestiades,  and  by  our %0aPeople,  Vulcaniae ;  ^oliae,  also,  because  ^Eohts  reigned  there %0ain  the  Time  that  Ilium  flourished. %0a%0a%0aCHAPTER  IX. %0aOf  Lipara. %0a%0aLIPARA,  with  a  Town  of  Roman  Citizens,  so  called  from %0aKing  Liparus,  who  succeeded  ^Eolus,  but  before  that  named %0aMelogonis,  or  Meligunis,  is  twelve  Miles  from  Italy ;  and  is %0aitself  somewhat  less  in  Circuit.  Between  it  and  Sicily  there %0ais  another,  formerly  named  Therasia,  now  Hiera,  because  it %0ais  sacred  to  Vulcan,  wherein  there  is  a  Hill  that  casteth  up %0aFlames  in  the  Night.  A  third  is  named  Strongyl£,  a  Mile %0afrom  Lipara,  lying  toward  the  Sun-rising,  wherein  JEolus %0areigned  ;  and  it  differeth  from  Lipara  only  in  that  it  sendeth %0aforth  more  lively  Flames  :  by  the  Smoke  thereof  the  People %0a%0a%0aBOOK  III.]  History  of  Nature.  179 %0a%0aof  that  Country  are  said  to  tell,  three  Days  before-hand1, %0awhat  Winds  will  blow  :  from  whence  it  is  commonly  thought, %0athat  the  Winds  were  obedient  to  JEolus.  A  fourth  is  named %0aDidym&,  less  than  Lipara  :  and  a  fifth,  Ericusa  :  a  sixth, %0aPhoenicusa,  left  to  feed  the  Rest  that  are  next  to  it :  the  last %0aand  least  is  Euonymus.  And  thus  much  concerning  the  first %0aGulf  that  divideth  Europe. %0a%0aCHAPTER  X. %0aOf  Locri,  the  Front  of  Italy. %0a%0aAT  Locri  beginneth  the  Front  of  Italy,  called  Magna %0aGraecia,  retiring  itself  into  three  Bays  of  the  Ausonian  Sea ; %0abecause  the  Ausones  first  occupied  it.  It  extendeth  eighty- %0atwo  Miles,  as  Varro  testifieth ;  but  the  greater  Number  of %0aWriters  have  made  it  but  seventy-two.  In  that  Coast  are %0aRivers  without  Number;  but  the  Things  which  are  worth %0athe  writing  of  near  Locri,  are  these  :  Sagra,  and  the  Vestiges %0aof  the  Town  Caulon  :  Mystia,  the  Camp  Consilinum,  Cerin- %0athus,  which  some  think  to  be  the  longest  Promontory  of %0aItaly.  Then  the  Bay  of  Scylaceum,  which  was  called  by  the %0aAthenians,  when  they  built  it,  Scylletium.  Which  Place  the %0aBay  Terinaeus  meeting  with,  maketh  a  Peninsula :  in  which %0athere  is  a  Port  called  Castra  Annibilis :  and  in  no  Place  is %0aItaly  narrower,  being  but  twenty  Miles  broad.  And,  therefore, %0aDionysius  the  Elder  wished  to  have  there  cut  it  off,  and %0aadded  it  to  Sicily.  Rivers  navigable  there :  Caecinos,  Cro- %0atalus,  Semirus,  Arocha,  Targines.  Within  is  the  Town  Pe- %0atilia,  the  Mountain  Alibanus,  and  the  Promontory  Lacinium  : %0abefore  the  Coast  of  which  is  an  Island  ten  Miles  from  the %0aLand,  called  Dioscoron ;  and  another  Calypsus,  which  Homer %0a%0a1  Wheelwright,  in  his  translation  of  Pindar,  thinks  the  following  lines %0afrom  the  seventh  Nemean  Ode  refer  to  the  circumstance  mentioned  by %0aPliny  :— %0a%0a"  Three  days  ere  yet  the  tempest  rise, %0aThe  skilful  mariner  descries,"  &c. %0a%0aWern.

In  it  is  the  Town  Croto,  and  the %0aRiver  Naeathus.  The  Town  Thurium,  between  the  two %0aRivers,  Arathis  and  Sybaris ;  where  there  was  a  Town  of  the %0asame  Name.  Likewise,  between  Siris  and  Aciris  there %0astandeth  Heraclea,  once  called  Siris.  Rivers,  Acalandrum, %0aMasuentum  ;  the  Town  Metapontum,  in  which  the  third %0aRegion  of  Italy  endeth.  The  inland  Inhabitants,  the  Aprus- %0atani  only,  are  of  the  Brutians  :  but  of  the  Lucani,  Thoati- %0anates,  Bantini,  Eburini,  Grumentini,  Potentini,  Sontini, %0aSirini,  Tergilani,  Ursentini,  Volcentani,  to  whom  the  Nu- %0amestrani  are  joined.  Besides  these,  Cato  writeth,  that  Thebes %0aof  the  Lucani  hath  perished.  And  Theopompus  saith,  that %0aPandosia  was  a  City  of  the  Lucani,  wherein  Alexander  the %0aEpirote  was  slain.  Attached  to  it  is  the  second  Region, %0acontaining  within  it  the  Hirpini,  Calabria,  Apulia,  and  the %0aSalentini,  within  a  Bay,  in  Compass  250  Miles ;  which  is %0acalled  Tarentinus,  from  a  Town  of  the  Laconi,  situated  in %0athe  Recess :  and  to  it  was  annexed  the  maritime  Colony %0awhich  was  there  :  it  is  distant  from  the  Promontory  Laci- %0anium 136  Miles  ;  putting  forth  Calabria  into  a  Peninsula %0aagainst  it.  The  Greeks  called  it  Messapia,  from  the  Name %0aof  a  Leader,  and  before  this,  Peucetia,  of  Peucetius,  the  bro- %0ather of  CEnotrus.  In  the  Salentine  Country,  between  the %0aPromontories,  there  is  the  Distance  of  100  Miles.  The %0aBreadth  of  this  Peninsula,  from  Tarentum  to  Brundisium,  by %0aLand,  is  two-and-thirty  Miles  ;  but  far  shorter  from  the  Port %0aSasina.  The  Towns  in  the  Continent  from  Tarentum,  are %0aVaria,  surnamed  Apula,  Cessapia  and  Aletium.

Two-and-thirty  Miles  off  is  the  Promontory %0awhich  they  call  Acra  Japygia,  from  which  Italy  runneth %0afurthest  into  the  Sea.  Beyond  it  is  the  Town  of  Basta,  and %0aHydruntum,  the  Space  of  nineteen  Miles,  to  make  a  Par- %0atition between  the  Ionian  and  the  Adriatic  Sea ;  through %0awhich  is  the  shortest  Passage  into  Greece,  over  against  the %0aTown  of  Apollonia  ;  where  the  Strait  running  between  is  not %0aabove  fifty  Miles  over.  This  Space  between,  Pyrrhus  King %0aof  Epirus,  intending  to  have  a  Passage  over  on  Foot,  first %0athought  to  make  Bridges  across  :  after  him,  M.  Varro,  at  the %0aTime  when  in  the  Pirates'  War,  he  was  Admiral  of  Pompeys %0aFleet.  But  both  of  them  were  stopped  by  other  Cares.

By  the %0aGreeks  it  was  called  Eridanus,  and  well  known  for  the %0aPunishment  of  Phaeton.  It  increaseth  about  the  Rising  of %0athe  Dog-star,  by  Reason  of  the  melting  Snow :  more  violent %0ato  the  Fields  thereby,  than  to  the  Vessels  :  nevertheless, %0anothing  is  stolen  away  to  itself;  but  when  it  hath  left  the %0aFields,  its  Bounty  is  more  abundant  by  their  Fruitfulness : %0afrom  its  Head  it  holdeth  on  its  Course  300  Miles,  adding,  for %0aits  meandering,  88  Miles.  It  receiveth  not  only  the  navi- %0agable Rivers  of  the  Apennines  and  the  Alps,  but  large  Lakes %0aalso  that  discharge  themselves  into  it :  so  that  in  all  it  car- %0arieth  into  the  Adriatic  Sea,  30  Rivers.  The  most  celebrated %0aof  them  are  these,  sent  out  of  the  Side  of  Apennine  :  Tanarus, %0aTrebia,  Placentinus,  Tarus,  Nicia,  Gabellus,  Scultenna,  Rhe- %0anus.

It  is  drawn  to  Ravenna  by  a  narrow  Channel,  where %0ait  is  called  Padusa,  and  in  Times  past,  Messanicus.  The %0anext  Mouth  that  he  maketh  from  thence,  carrieth  the  Big- %0aness of  a  Harbour,  which  is  named  Vatreni :  at  which  Clau- %0adius Ctesar,  as  he  came  triumphant  from  Britain,  entered %0ainto  Adria,  with  that  Vessel,  more  like  a  huge  House  than  a %0aShip.  This  Mouth  of  it  was  formerly  called  Eridanum :  by %0aothers,  Spineticum,  from  the  neighbouring  City  Spinae,  built %0aby  Diomedes  (as  some  think),  with  the  Treasures  of  Delphi. %0aThere  the  River  Vatrenus,  from  out  of  the  Territory  of %0aForum  Cornelii,  increaseth  Padus.  The  next  Mouth  is %0aCaprasise,  then  Sagis,  then  Volane,  which  before  was  named %0aOlane.  All  those  Rivers  and  Trenches,  the  Thusci  were  the %0afirst  to  make  out  of  Sagis,  carrying  the  forcible  Stream  of  the %0aRiver  across  into  the  Atrian  Ponds,  which  are  called  the  seven %0aSeas ;  and  they  made  the  famous  Harbour  of  Atria,  a  Town %0aof  the  Thusci ;  of  which  the  Atriatic  Sea  took  the  Name %0aaforetime  ;  which  now  is  called  Adriaticum.  From  thence %0aare  the  full  Mouths  of  Carbonaria,  and  the  Fosses  Phylis- %0atinse,  which  others  call  Tartarus  ;  but  all  spring  out  of  the %0aoverflowing  of  the  Foss  Phylistina,  with  Athesis  coming  out  of %0athe  Tridentine  Alps,  and  Togisonus  out  of  the  Territory  of  the %0aPatavini.  Part  of  them  made  also  the  next  Port  Brundulum  : %0alike  as  the  two  Medoaci  and  the  Foss  Clodia,  make  Edron. %0aWith  these  Padus  mingleth  itself,  and  by  these  it  runneth %0aover ;  and,  as  it  is  said  by  most  Writers,  like  as  in  Egypt %0aNilus  maketh  that  which  they  call  Delta,  so  it  shapeth  a %0atriangular  Figure  between  the  Alps  and  the  Sea-coast,  two %0aMiles  in  Compass.  It  is  a  Shame  to  borrow  from  the  Greeks %0athe  Explanation  of  Things  in  Italy  :  but  Metrodorus  Scepsius %0asaith,  that  because  about  the  Head  of  this  River  there  grow %0amany  Pitch  Trees,  called  in  the  Gallic  Language,  Pades, %0atherefore  it  took  the  Name  of  Padus.  Also,  that  in  the %0aLigurian  Language,  the  River  itself  is  called  Bodincus, %0awhich  means  bottomless.  And  to  approve  this  Argument, %0athere  is  a  neighbouring  Town  called  Industria,  but  by  an  old %0aName,  Bodincomagum ;  where  beginneth  its  greatest  Depth. %0a%0a%0a188  History  of  Nature.

That  Comus  and  Bergomus, %0aand  Licini- Forum,  with  other  People  thereabout,  were  of  the %0aOrobian  Race,  Cato  hath  reported  :  but  the  Original  of  that %0aNation,  he  confesseth  that  he  knoweth  not.

Rivers %0aand  Havens :  Romatinum,  Tilaventum,  the  greater  and  the %0aless  :  Anassum,  by  which  Varranus  runneth  down  :  Alsa, %0aNatiso,  with  Turrus,  running  by  Aquileia,  a  Colony  situated %0a12  Miles  from  the  Sea.  This  is  the  Region  of  the  Carni, %0ajoining  that  of  Japides :  the  River  Timavus,  and  the  Castle %0aPucinum,  famous  for  good  Wine.  The  Bay  Tergestinus,  the %0aColony  Tergeste,  23  Miles  from  Aquileia  :  beyond  which  six %0aMiles,  is  the  River  Formio,  189  Miles  from  Ravenna:  the %0aancient  Limit  of  Italy  enlarged,  but  at  this  Day  of  Istria, %0awhich  they  report,  was  so  named  of  the  River  Ister,  flowing %0aout  of  the  River  Danubius  into  Adria  :  and  over  against  the %0asame  Ister,  the  Mouth  of  Padus :  by  the  contrary  rushing %0aStreams  of  which  two  Rivers,  the  Sea  between  beginneth  to %0abe  more  mild ;  as  many  Authors  have  reported,  but  untruly  ; %0aand  Cornelius  Nepos,  also,  although  he  dwelt  just  by  Padus  : %0afor  there  is  no  River  that  runneth  out  of  Danubius  into  the %0aAdriatic  Sea.  They  were  deceived  (1  suppose),  because  the %0aShip  Argos1  went  down  a  River  into  the  Adriatic  Sea,  not  far %0a%0a1  The  Argonauts  embarked  at  Jolcos,  in  Thessaly,  and  steered  first  to %0aLemnos :  from  whence,  after  many  adventures,  they  reached  the  Phasis, %0awhich  flows  through  Colchis  into  the  Black  Sea.    It  would  be  no  easy %0atask  to  point  out  the  course  they  took  on  their  return.    Pindar,  in  the %0aFourth  Pythian  Ode,  makes  them  pass  the  Erythraean  Sea— %0a"  Then  mingling  in  the  ocean  deep, %0aThe  Erythraean  Sea  they  sweep." %0aBy  the  Erythraean  Sea  the  Indian  Ocean  is  to  be  understood,  through %0a%0a%0a190  History  of  Nature.

The %0amore  diligent  Enquirers  say,  that  it  was  carried  upon  Men's %0aShoulders  over  the  Alps  :  and  that  it  was  embarked  into %0aIster,  and  so  into  Saus,  and  then  Nauportus,  which  upon %0athat  occasion  took  his  Name,  which  riseth  between  ^Emona %0aand  the  Alps. %0a%0aCHAPTER   XIX. %0aIstria. %0a%0aISTRIA  runneth  out  like  a  Peninsula.  Some  have  deli- %0avered, that  it  is  40  Miles  broad,  and  122  Miles  in  Circuit. %0aThe  like  they  say  of  Liburnia  adjoining  to  it,  and  of  the  Bay %0aFlanaticus.  But  others  say,  that  the  Circuit  of  Liburnia  is %0a180  Miles.  Some  have  set  out  Japidia  to  the  Bay  Flanaticus, %0abehind  Istria,  130  Miles  :  and  so  have  made  Liburnia  in  Cir- %0acuit 150  Miles.  TuditanuSj  who  subdued  the  Istri,  upon  his %0aown  Statue  there  set  this  Inscription  :  from  Aquileia  to %0athe  River  Titius,  are  200  Stadia.  The  Towns  in  Istria,  of %0aRoman  Citizens,  are  ^Egida  and  Parentium.  A  Colony  there %0ais,  Pola,  now  called  Pietas  Julia ;  built  in  old  Time  by  the %0aColchii.  It  is  from  Tergeste,  100  Miles.  Soon  after,  the %0aTown  Nesactium,  and  the  River  Arsia,  now  the  Bound  of %0aItaly.  From  Ancona  to  Pola,  there  is  a  Passage  over  the %0aSea  of  120  Miles.  In  the  Midland  Part  of  this  tenth  Region %0aare  the  Colonies,  Cremona  and  Brixia,  in  the  Country  of %0athe  Cenomanni :  but  in  the  Country  of  the  Veneti,  Ateste. %0aAlso  the  Towns  Acelum,  Patavium,  Opitergium,  Belunum, %0aVicetia :  Mantua  of  the  Tusci,  the  only  Place  left  beyond %0athe  Padus.  That  the  Veneti  were  the  Offspring  of  the  Tro- %0a%0awhich  it  seems  they  came  into  Africa,  and  when  arrived  on  land,  carrying %0athe  ship  on  their  shoulders  until  they  came  to  the  Tritoniari  Lake,  they %0asailed  into  the  Mediterranean,  and  touched  at  Thera;  thence  through %0athe  Ocean  they  came  to  the  island  of  Lemnos.  —  (See  Wheelwright's %0a"  Pindar.")  But  a  more  probable  course  would  be  one  approaching  that %0agiven  by  Pliny  in  the  text.  The  whole  story  of  the  Argonauts,  how- %0aever, having,  in  the  lapse  of  time,  become  a  mere  fable,  it  is  not  worth  the %0aattempt  to  illustrate  it. —  Wern.

Fertini,  Tridentini,  and %0aBernenses,  are  Towns  of  Rhetia.  Verona  is  of  the  Rheti  and %0aEuganei;  Julienses  of  the  Garni.  Then  follow  these,  whom %0awe  need  to  use  no  Strictness  in  naming ;  Alutruenses,  Asse- %0ariates,  Flamonienses,  Vannienses,  and  others  surnamed %0aGulici :  Foro  Julienses,  surnamed  Transpadani :  Foretani, %0aVenidates,  Querqueni,  Taurisani,  Togienses,  Varvani.  In %0athis  Tract  there  have  perished  in  the  Borders,  Itamine,  Pel- %0alaon,  Palsicium.  Of  the  Veneti,  Atina  and  Caelina :  of  the %0aGarni,  Segeste  and  Ocra :  and  of  the  Taurissi,  Noreia.  Also %0afrom  Aquileia  twelve  Miles,  there  was  a  Town  destroyed  by %0aM.  Claudius  Marcellus,  in  spite  of  the  Senate,  as  L.  Piso %0ahath  recorded.  In  this  Region  there  are  also  ten  remarkable %0aLakes  and  Rivers,  either  issuing  forth  of  them  as  their  Off- %0aspring, or  else  maintained  by  them,  if  they  send  them  out %0aagain,  when  they  have  received  them :  as  Larius  doth  Addua, %0aVerbanus  Ticinus,  Benacus  Mincius,  Sebinus  Ossius,  Eupi- %0alius  Lamber,  all  seated  in  the  Padus.  The  Alps  reach  in %0aLength  ten  Miles  from  the  upper  Sea  to  the  lower,  as  Ccdius %0asaith :  Timogenes,  two-and-twenty :  but  Cornelius  Nepos,  in %0aBreadth  100  Miles  :  T.  Livius  saith,  3000  Stadia.  But  both %0aof  them  take  Measure  in  different  Places ;  for  sometimes  they %0aexceed  100  Miles,  where  they  separate  Germany  from  Italy : %0aand  in  other  Parts  they  are  so  narrow,  that  they  make  not %0afull  out  three  score  and  ten  Miles  ;  as  if  by  the  Provi- %0adence of  Nature.

[Boox  III. %0a%0anow  Norici.  To  these  are  Neighbours  the  Rheti  and  Vin- %0adelici,  all  divided  into  many  Cities.  The  Rheti  are  judged %0ato  be  descended  from  the  Thusci,  driven  out  by  the  Galli, %0awith  their  Leader  Rhcetus1.  But  turning  our  Breast  to  Italy, %0awe  meet  with  the  Euganean  Nations  of  the  Alps,  who  en- %0ajoyed the  Right  of  the  Latins,  and  whose  Towns  Cato  reck- %0aoneth  to  the  number  of  four  and  thirty.  Of  them,  the %0aTriumpilini,  both  People  and  Lands,  were  sold.  After  them %0athe  Camuni,  and  many  such,  were  annexed  to  the  next  Muni- %0acipii.  The  Lepontii  and  the  Salassi,  Cato  thinketh  to  be  of %0athe  Tauric  Nation.  But  almost  all  others  suppose  that  the %0aLepontici  were  a  Residue  left  behind  of  the  Companions  of %0aHercules ,  through  the  interpretation  of  the  Greek  Name,  as %0ahaving  their  Members  burned  with  the  Alpine  snows  as  they %0apassed  through  :  that  the  Graii  likewise  were  of  the  same %0aCompany,  planted  in  the  Passage,  and  inhabiting  the  Alps %0aGraiae :  also  that  the  Euganei  were  noblest  in  Birth,  from %0awhich  they  took  their  Name.  The  Head  of  them  is  Stonos. %0aOf  those  Rhoeti  the  Vennonetes  and  Sarunetes  inhabit  the %0aHeads  of  the  River  Rhenus  :  and  of  the  Leponti,  those  who %0aare  called  Viberi  dwell  by  the  Fountain  of  Rhodanus,  in %0athe  same  quarter  of  the  Alps.  There  be  also  Inhabitants %0awithin  the  Alps  endowed  with  the  Liberty  of  Latium :  as %0athe  Octodurenses,  and  their  Borderers  the  Centrones,  the %0aCottian  Cities.  The  Caturiges,  and  the  Vagienni,  from %0athem  descended  ;  Ligures,  and  such  as  are  called  the  Moun- %0ataineers :  and  many  kinds  of  the  Capillati,  on  the  Borders %0aof  the  Ligusticus  Sea.  In  seemeth  not  amiss  in  this  Place %0ato  set  down  an  Inscription  out  of  a  Trophy  erected  in %0athe  Alps,  which  runneth  in  this  Form  :  To  the  Emperor %0aCaesar,  Son  o/Divus  Augustus,  Pontifex  Maximus,  Imperator %0afourteen  Times,  and  invested  with  the  Authority  of  the %0aTribune  seventeen  Times  :  the  Senate  and  People  of  Rome  : %0aFor  that  under  his  Conduct  and  Auspices,  all  the  Alpine %0a%0a1  Justin,  xx.  5,  p.  181,  says,  "  The  Tusci,  with  their  leader  Koetus, %0ahaving  lost  their  ancient  territorial  possessions,  took  possession  of  the %0aAlps,  and  laid  the  foundation  of  the  nation  of  the  Roeti,  so  called  after  the %0aname  of  their  leader." —  Wern.

It  beginneth %0afrom  the  confluent  above  named.  In  it  are  the  Dardani, %0aCelegeri,  Triballi,  Trimachi,  Mcesi,  Thraces,  and  the  Scy- %0athae,  bordering  upon  Pontus.

From  Drinium  to  the  Promontory  Acroce- %0araunium,  182  Miles.  M.  Agrippa  hath  set  down  this  whole %0aGulf,  comprehending  Italy  and  Illyricum,  in  the  compass  of %0a1300  Miles.  In  it  are  two  Seas,  bounded  as  I  have  said: %0athat  is,  the  Lower,  otherwise  called  the  Ionian,  in  the  first %0aPart :  the  Inner,  called  Adriaticum,  which  also  they  name %0athe  Upper.  In  the  Ausonian  Sea  there  are  no  Islands  worth %0athe  naming,  but  those  above  specified.  In  the  Ionian  Sea %0athere  are  but  few :  upon  the  Calabrian  Coast,  before  Brun- %0adusium,  by  the  interposition  of  which  the  Harbour  is  made : %0aand  against  the  Apulian  Coast,  Diomedea,  famous  for  the %0aTomb  of  Diomedes.  Another  of  the  same  Name,  called  by %0asome  Teutria.  The  Coast  of  Illyricum  is  heaped  with  more %0athan  1000  ;  such  is  the  nature  of  the  Sea,  full  of  Shallows, %0awith  narrow  Channels  running^ between.  But  before  the %0aMouth  of  Timavus,  there  are  Islands  famous  for  hot  Waters, %0awhich  flow  with  the  Sea.  And  near  the  Territory  of  the %0aIstri,  Cissa,  Pullariaj,  and  those  which  the'Greeks  name  Ab- %0asyrtides,  from  Absyrtis,  Brother  of  Medea,  there  slain.

In  the  Ionian  Sea,  from %0aOricum  1000  Miles,  is  Sasonis,  well  known  for  the  Station  of %0aPirates. %0a%0a1  There  were  two  islands  called  Melita :  one  of  them  between  Sicily %0aand  Africa,  famous  for  the  shipwreck  of  St.  Paul ;  and  from  which,  Strabo %0asays,  the  Melitean  or  Maltese  dogs  took  their  name.  The  other  Melita %0awas  on  the  coast  of  Illyria ;  and  from  this,  other  authors  besides  Pliny %0asuppose  these  favourite  animals  to  have  been  derived.—  Wern.  Club. %0a%0a%0aNote. — The  reader  will  have  observed  in  the  preceding  chapters  a %0astrange  diversity  of  opinion  in  the  mind  of  the  author :  for  whilst  he %0aascribes  every  ominous  appearance  to  the  deities  presiding  over  the  affairs %0aof  men,  yet,  in  other  passages,  he  expresses  his  doubts  as  to  their  ex- %0aistence, or  would  limit  to  the  earth  itself  the  controlling  power ;  in  other %0awords,  he  believed  the  earth  to  be  a  deity.  From  these  incongruities  we %0acan  derive  but  one  opinion,  namely,  that,  heathen  as  he  was,  Pliny  never- %0atheless doubted  the  truth  of  that  which  his  countrymen  and  other  heathen %0anations  believed,  whilst  he  fell  short  of  that  true  knowledge  which,  in %0aand  before  his  day,  had  been  vouchsafed  to  many  like  himself,  who  from %0aheathenism  were  converted  to  Christianity,  either  through  the  evidence %0aof  miracles,  by  which  its  truth  was  supported,  or  through  the  opening  of %0athe  eyes  of  the  understanding,  by  which  means  they  acknowledged  that %0awhich  seemed  a  mystery  before.  Considering  these  chapters  in  this  light, %0amuch  interest  is  added  to  the  style  and  spirit  in  which  our  author  wrote. %0a— Wern.

PLINIUS  SECUNDUS. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c THE   PREFACE. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c we  have  written  of  the  Position  and %0a%3c Wonders  of  the  Earth,  Waters,  and  Stars  :  also %0a%3c of  the  Proportion  and  Measure  of  the  whole %0a%3c World.  Now  we  proceed  to  the  Parts  thereof; %0a%3c although  this  also  be  judged  an  infinite  Piece %0a%3c of  Work,  and  not  lightly  to  be  handled  without %0a%3c some  Reprehension  :  and  yet  in  no  kind  of  Enterprise  is %0a%3c Pardon  more  due  ;  since  it  is  little  Wonder,  if  he  who  is  born %0a%3c a  Man  knoweth  not  all  Things  belonging  to  Man.  And %0a%3c therefore,  I  will  not  follow  one  Author  particularly,  but %0a%3c every  one  as  I  shall  think  him  most  true  in  each  Part.  Be- %0a%3c cause it  hath  been  common,  in  a  Manner,  to  them  all,  to  de- %0a%3c scribe the  Situations  of  those  Places  most  exactly,  from %0a%3c whence  themselves  proceeded  :  and,  therefore,  neither  will  I %0a%3c blame  nor  reprove  any  Man.  The  bare  Names  of  Places %0a%3c shall  be  simply  set  down  ;  and  that  with  as  much  Brevity  as %0a%3c I  can  :  the  Excellency,  as  well  as  the  Causes,  being  deferred %0a%3c to  their  several  Treatises  :  for  now  the  Question  is  touching %0a%3c the  Earth  in  general.  And,  therefore,  I  would  have  Things %0a%3c to  be  taken  as  if  the  Names  of  Countries  were  put  down  void %0a%3c of  Renown,  and  such  only  as  they  were  in  the  Beginning, %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BOOK  III.]  History  of  Nature.  151 %0a%3c %0a%3c before  any  Acts  were  done ;  and  as  if  they  had  indeed  an %0a%3c Enduement  of  Names,  but  respective  only  to  the  World  and %0a%3c Nature  of  Things. %0a%3c %0a%3c The  whole  Globe  of  the  Earth  is  divided  into  three  Parts, %0a%3c Europe,  Asia,  and  Africa.  The  Beginning  we  take  from  the %0a%3c West  and  the  Straits  of  Gades,  where  the  Atlantic  Ocean %0a%3c breaking  in,  is  spread  into  the  inland  Seas.  Entering  there, %0a%3c Africa  is  on  the  right  Hand,  Europe  on  the  left,  and  Asia %0a%3c between  them.  The  Bounds  confining  these  are  the  Rivers %0a%3c Tanais  and  Nil  us.  The  Mouth  of  the  Ocean  of  which  I  spoke %0a%3c lyeth  out  in  Length  fifteen  Miles,  and  in  Breadth  five,  from %0a%3c a  Village  in  Spain  called  Mellaria  to  the  Promontory  of %0a%3c Africa  called  the  White,  as  Turannius  Graccula,  who  was %0a%3c born  there,  writeth.  T.  Livius  and  Nepos  Cornelius  have %0a%3c reported,  that  the  Breadth,  where  it  is  narrowest,  is  seven %0a%3c Miles,  and  ten  Miles  where  it  is  broadest.  From  so  small  a %0a%3c Mouth  spreadeth  so  vast  an  Expanse  of  Waters ;  nor  doth %0a%3c such  exceeding  Depth  lessen  the  Wonder.  In  the  very %0a%3c Mouth  of  it  are  many  Shelves  of  white  Sands,  to  the  great %0a%3c Terror  of  Ships  passing  that  Way.  And  therefore,  many %0a%3c have  called  those  Straits  the  Entry  of  the  Mediterranean  Sea. %0a%3c Near  to  the  Sides  of  this  Gullet,  are  set  two  Mountains,  one %0a%3c on  each  Side,  as  Barriers  to  shut  all  in :  which  are,  Abila  for %0a%3c Africa,  and  Calpe  for  Europe,  the  Limits  of  the  Labours  of %0a%3c Hercules.  For  which  Cause,  the  Inhabitants  of  those  Parts %0a%3c call  them  the  Pillars  of  that  God  ;  and  they  believe,  that %0a%3c by  Ditches  digged  within  the  Continent,  the  Ocean,  before %0a%3c excluded,  was  let  in  ;  and  so  the  Face  of  the  Earth  was %0a%3c changed. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  I. %0a%3c %0a%3c Of  Europe 1 . %0a%3c %0a%3c AND  first,  of  Europe,  the  Nurse  of  that  People  which  is %0a%3c the  Conqueror  of  all  Nations  ;  and  of  all  Lands  by  many %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  This  claim  of  superiority  is  advanced  by  the  Roman,  in  the  con- %0a%3c sciousness of  his  country's  power  and  greatness;  and  although  1800  years %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 1 52  History  of  Na  ture.

The  Ocean,  then,  at  this  Space %0a%3c abovesaid  entereth  into  the  Atlantic  Sea,  and  with  a  greedy %0a%3c Current  drowneth  those  Lands  which  dread  his  coming ; %0a%3c but  those  Shores  that  resist,  with  its  windings  it  eateth  and %0a%3c hollo weth  continually,  excavating  many  Creeks  in  Europe, %0a%3c wherein  four  remarkable  Gulfs  are  to  be  seen. %0a%3c %0a%3c Of  these  the  first,  from  Calpe,  the  remotest  Promontory %0a%3c (as  is  abovesaid)  of  Spain,  is  bent  with  an  exceeding  great %0a%3c Compass,  to  Locri ;  and  as  far  as  the  Promontory  Brutium. %0a%3c Within  it  lieth  Spain,  the  first  of  Lands  ;  that  Part,  I  mean, %0a%3c which,  in  regard  of  Rome,  is  the  further  off,  and  is  named %0a%3c also  Boetica.  And  presently  from  the  End  of  Virgitanus, %0a%3c the  hither  Part,  otherwise  called  Tarraconensis,  as  far  as  the %0a%3c Pyrenean  Mountains.  That  further  Part  is  divided  into  two %0a%3c Provinces  through  the  Length  :  for  on  the  North  Side  of %0a%3c Boetica  lieth  Lusitania,  divided  from  it  by  the  River  Ana. %0a%3c %0a%3c This  River  beginneth  in  the  Territory  Larninitanus  of  the %0a%3c nearer  Spain,  one  while  spreading  out  itself  into  Pools,  then %0a%3c again  gathering  into  narrow  Brooks  :  or  altogether  hidden %0a%3c under  Ground,  and  taking  Pleasure  to  rise  up  oftentimes, %0a%3c falleth  into  the  Atlantic  Ocean.  But  the  Part  named  Tarra- %0a%3c conensis, lying  close  to  the  Pyrenean  Mountain  and  running %0a%3c along  all  the  Side  thereof,  and,  at  the  same  Time,  stretching %0a%3c out  itself  across  from  the  Iberian  Sea  to  the  Gallic  Ocean, %0a%3c is  separated  from  Boetica  and  Lusitania  by  the  Mountain %0a%3c %0a%3c have  passed,  and  that  greatness  has  departed  like  a  dream,  European %0a%3c superiority  still  exists.  A  prophecy  from  the  remotest  ages  (Gen.  ix.  27) %0a%3c —  delivered  under  circumstances  in  which  its  fulfilment  was  exceedingly %0a%3c unlikely  —  has  proclaimed,  that  the  God  whom  Pliny  did  not  know  shall %0a%3c enlarge  Japhet,  the  father  of  European  nations  ;  —  that  he  shall  dwell  in %0a%3c the  tents  of  Shem,  and  Canaan  shall  be  his  servant.  And,  accordingly, %0a%3c we  see  the  inhabitants  of  Europe  spreading  out,  and  exerting  a  mastery, %0a%3c in  the  most  distant  climes ;  in  the  strength  of  their  superiority  in  the  arts %0a%3c of  life,  in  science,  the  freedom  of  their  political  institutions,  and,  above  all, %0a%3c in  religion.  The  superiority  must  continue  so  long  as  this  foundation  of %0a%3c it  shall  exist.  Esto  perpetua. —  Wern.

It  is  clear  that  the  Celtici  came  from  the  Celtibe- %0a%3c rians,  out   of  Lusitania,    as   appeareth   by   their   Religion, %0a%3c Tongue,  and  Names  of  Towns,  which  in  Bcetica  are  distin- %0a%3c guished by  their  Surnames  ;  as  Seria,  which  is  called  Fama %0a%3c Julia:  Ucultuniacum,  which  now  is  Curiga  :   Laconimurgi,. %0a%3c Constantia  Julia ;  Terresibus  is  now  Fortunales  ;  and  Callen- %0a%3c sibus,  Emanici.

Now  the %0a%3c whole  Province  is  divided  into  seven  Jurisdictions  :  the  Car- %0a%3c thaginian, the  Tarraconensian,  Caesar  Augustanian,  Cluni- %0a%3c ensian,  Asturian,  Lucensician,  and  of  Bracarum.  There  are %0a%3c besides  Islands,  which  we  set  aside  without  naming  them, %0a%3c and  excepting  the  Cities  that  are  annexed  to  others,  the %0a%3c Province  itself  containeth  294  Towns.  In  which  Colonies %0a%3c there  be  twelve  Towns,  of  Roman  Citizens  thirteen,  of  old %0a%3c Latins  seventeen,  of  Allies  one,  stipendiary  136.

After  it  is  the  maritime  Country %0a%3c of  the  Volscians,  and  Campania  :  then  Picentium,  Lu- %0a%3c canum,  and  Brutium,  the  furthest  Point  in  the  South,  to %0a%3c which,  from  the  moonshaped  Mountains  of  the  Alps,  Italy %0a%3c shooteth  out  to  the  Seas.

She  also  is  the  Mother,  chosen  by %0a%3c the  Power  of  the  Gods,  to  make  even  Heaven  itself  more %0a%3c Glorious  ;  to  gather  into  One  the  scattered  Empires,  to %0a%3c soften  the  Fashions  of  other  Countries ;  and  whereas  the %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BOOK  III.]  History  of  Nature.  163 %0a%3c %0a%3c Languages  of  so  many  Nations  were  repugnant  and  savage, %0a%3c to  draw  them  together  by  commerce  of  Speech,  to  a  Con- %0a%3c ference;  to  endue  Man  with  Humanity;  and  briefly,  that  of %0a%3c all  Nations  in  the  World  there  should  be  one  only  Country. %0a%3c But  so  noble  are  all  the  Places  that  a  Man  shall  come  to, %0a%3c so  excellent  is  every  thing,  and  each  State  so  famous,  that  I %0a%3c am  at  a  loss  what  to  say.  The  City  of  Rome,  the  only  fair %0a%3c Face  therein  worthy  to  stand  upon  so  stately  a  Neck,  what %0a%3c Work  would  it  ask  to  be  described  as  it  ought l  ?  The  very %0a%3c Tract  of  Campania  by  itself,  so  pleasant  and  happy,  how %0a%3c should  it  be  described?  So  that  it  is  evident  in  this  one %0a%3c Place  there  is  the  Work  of  rejoicing  Nature.  Besides  this, %0a%3c the  whole  Temperature  of  the  Air  is  evermore  so  vital,  the %0a%3c Fields  so  fertile,  the  Hills  so  open  to  the  Sun,  the  Forests %0a%3c so  harmless,  the  Groves  so  shady,  the  kinds  of  Wood  so %0a%3c bounteous,  the  Mountains  so  breezy ;  the  Corn,  the  Vines, %0a%3c the  Olives  so  fertile  ;  the  Sheep  so  enriched  with  such  noble %0a%3c Fleeces.;  such  Necks  to  the  Oxen ;  so  many  Lakes,  such %0a%3c abundance  of  Rivers  and  Springs  watering  it  throughout ;  so %0a%3c many  Seas  and  Havens,  that  it  is  the  very  Bosom  lying  open %0a%3c to  receive  the  Commerce  of  all  Lands ;  and  as  of  itself %0a%3c earnestly  desiring  to  lie  far  into  the  Sea  to  help  all  Mankind. %0a%3c Neither  do  I  speak  now  of  the  Natures  and  Manners  of  the %0a%3c Men ;  nor  of  the  Nations  subdued  by  their  Tongue  and %0a%3c Hand.  Even  the  Greeks  (a  Nation  of  all  other  most  given %0a%3c to  praise  themselves)  have  given  their  judgment  of  her,  in %0a%3c that  they  called  a  certain  Part  thereof  Great  Greece.

[BooK  III. %0a%3c %0a%3c we  do  in  this  Part :  only  I  pray  the  Readers  to  remember %0a%3c that  I  hasten  to  rehearse  every  particular  Thing  through %0a%3c the  whole  Globe. %0a%3c %0a%3c Italy  is  fashioned  like  to  an  Oak  leaf,  being  much  larger %0a%3c in  Length  than  in  Breadth:  to  the  left  Side  bending  with %0a%3c the  Top,  and  ending  in  the  Figure  of  an  Amazonian  Shield  : %0a%3c and  where,  from  the  middle  Extension,  it  is  called  Cocin- %0a%3c thos,  it  putteth  forth  through  two  moonshaped  Promontories %0a%3c two  Horns :  the  one,  Leucopetra,  on  the  right  Hand ;  the  other, %0a%3c Lacinium,  on  the  left.  In  Length  it  reacheth  from  the  Foot %0a%3c of  the  Alps  to  Prsetoria  Augusta,  through  the  City  of  Rome, %0a%3c and  so  to  Capua,  with  a  course  leading  to  Rhegium,  a  Town %0a%3c situated  upon  the  Shoulder  thereof:  from  which  beginneth %0a%3c the  bending,  as  it  were,  of  the  Neck,  and  beareth  1020 %0a%3c Miles.  And  this  Measure  would  be  much  more  if  it  went %0a%3c as  far  as  Lacinium  ;  but  such  an  Obliquity  might  seem  to %0a%3c decline  out  too  much  to  one  Side.  Its  Breadth  is  various  ; %0a%3c being  410  Miles  between  the  two  Seas,  the  Higher  and %0a%3c the  Lower,  and  the  Rivers  Varus  and  Arsia.  The  middle %0a%3c portions  of  this  Breadth,  which  is  much  about  the  City  of %0a%3c Rome,  from  the  Mouth  of  the  River  Aternus  running  into %0a%3c the  Adriatic  Sea,  unto  the  Mouths  of  Tiber,  136  Miles;  and %0a%3c somewhat  less  from  Novum  Castrum  by  the  Adriatic  Sea,  to %0a%3c Alsium,  and  so  to  the  Tuscan  Sea :  and  in  no  Place  ex- %0a%3c ceedeth  it  in  Breadth  300  Miles.  But  the  full  Compass  of %0a%3c the  whole,  from  Varus  to  Arsia,  is  20,049  Miles.  It  is %0a%3c distant  by  Sea  from  the  Lands  round  about,  that  is,  from %0a%3c Istria  and  Liburnia,  in  some  Places  100  Miles;  from  Epirus %0a%3c and  Illyricuni,  50  Miles  ;  from  Africa,  less  than  200,  as  Varro %0a%3c affirmeth  ;  from  Sardinia,  120  Miles  ;  from  Sicily,  a  Mile  and %0a%3c a  half ;  from  Corey ra,  less  than  70  ;  from  tssa,  50.  It  goeth %0a%3c along  the  Seas  even  to  the  Meridional  Line  of  the  Heaven ; %0a%3c but  if  a  Man  examine  it  very  exactly,  it  lieth  between  the %0a%3c Sun-rising  in  Mid-winter,  and  the  Point  of  the  Meridian. %0a%3c %0a%3c Now  we  will  describe  the  Circuit  of  this  Country,  and %0a%3c reckon  the  Cities :  wherein  it  is  necessary  to  be  premised, %0a%3c that  we  shall  follow  our  Author  Divus  Augustus,  and  the %0a%3c Description  by  him  made  of  all  Italy  ;  arranged  into  eleven %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BOOK  III.]  History  of  Nature.  1 65 %0a%3c %0a%3c Regions.  The  Maritime  Towns  I  will  set  down  in  the  order %0a%3c as  they  stand,  according  to  their  vicinity  one  to  another. %0a%3c But  as  in  so  running  a  Speech,  the  rest  cannot  be  so %0a%3c orderly  described,  therefore  in  the  Inland  part  thereof  I %0a%3c will  follow  him  as  he  hath  digested  them  in  Letters,  but %0a%3c mentioning  the  Colonies  by  Name  which  he  hath  delivered %0a%3c in  that  number.  Neither  is  it  easy  to  follow  thoroughly %0a%3c their  Positions  and  Origins,  considering  the  Ingaun  Li- %0a%3c gurians  (to  say  nothing  of  all  the  rest)  were  endowed  with %0a%3c Lands  thirty  times.  To  begin  with  the  River  Varus,  there- %0a%3c fore, there  is  the  Town  Nicsea,  built  by  the  Massilians ;  the %0a%3c River  Po ;  the  Alps  ;  the  People  within  the  Alps,  of  many %0a%3c Names,  but  chiefly  the  Capillati :  the  Town  Vediantiorum, %0a%3c the  City  Cemelion  (or  a  Town  belonging  to  the  State  of  the %0a%3c Vedianti,  called  Cemelion) ;  the  Port  of  Hercules  Monoscus  ; %0a%3c the  Ligustian  Coast.  Of  the  Liguri,  the  most  renowned %0a%3c beyond  the  Alps  are  the  Sally i,  Deceates,  and  Oxubii :  on %0a%3c this  Side,  the  Veneni,  and,  descended  from  the  Caturiges, %0a%3c the  Vagienni,  Statilli,  Vibelli,  Magelli,  Euburiates,  Cas- %0a%3c monates,  Veliates,  and  those  whose  Towns  we  will  declare %0a%3c in  the  next  Coast.  The  River  Rutuba,  the  Town  Albium, %0a%3c Intemelium,  the  River  Merula,  the  Town  Albium  Ingaunum, %0a%3c the  Port  Vadum  Sabatium,  the  River  Porcifera,  the  Town %0a%3c Genua,  the  River  Feritor ;  the  Port  Delphini,  Tigulia : %0a%3c within,  Segesta  Tiguliorum  :  the  River  Macra,  which  limiteth %0a%3c Liguria.  But  on  the  back  of  all  these  Towns  above-named %0a%3c is  Apenninus,  the  highest  Mountain  of  all  Italy,  reaching %0a%3c from  the  Alps,  with  a  continual  ridge  of  Hills,  to  the %0a%3c Straits  of  Sicily.  From  the  other  Side  of  this  to  Pad  us, %0a%3c the  richest  River  of  Italy,  all  the  Country  shineth  with  noble %0a%3c Towns :  Liberna,  Dertona  a  Colony,  Iria,  Barderates,  In- %0a%3c dustria,  Pollentia,  Cartea,  which  also  is  named  Polentia; %0a%3c Foro  Fulvii  the  same  as  Valentinum  ;  Augusta  of  the  Va- %0a%3c gienni :  Alba  Pompeia,  Asta,  and  Aquae  Statiellorum.  This %0a%3c is  the  ninth  Region,  according  to  the  Arrangement  of  Au- %0a%3c gustus. The  Coast  of  Liguria  lieth  between  the  Rivers  Varus %0a%3c and  Macra,  211  Miles.  To  it  is  adjoined  the  seventh, %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 166  History  of  Nature.  [BooK  III. %0a%3c %0a%3c wherein  is  Hetruria,  from  the  River  Macra  :  and  itself, %0a%3c with  the  Names  often  changed.  In  old  Time  the  Pelasgi %0a%3c drove  the  Umbri  from  thence  :  and  by  them  the  Lydi  did %0a%3c the  like,  of  whose  King  they  were  named  Tyrrheni:  but %0a%3c soon  after,  of  their  Ceremonies  in  Sacrificing,  in  the  Greek %0a%3c Language  Thusci.  The  first  Town  of  Hetruria  is  Luna,  with %0a%3c a  famous  Harbour ;  then  the  Colony  Luca,  lying  from  the %0a%3c Sea :  and  nearer  to  it  is  Pisae,  between  the  River  Auser %0a%3c and  Arnus,  which  took  the  Beginning  from  Pelops  and  the %0a%3c Pisi,  or  Atintani,  a  Greek  Nation.  Vada  Vollaterranea,  the %0a%3c River  Cecinna.  Populonium  of  the  Hetrusci,  in  Times  past %0a%3c situate  only  upon  this  Coast.  After  these,  the  Rivers  Prille, %0a%3c and,  soon  after,  Umbro,  navigable :  so  forward  the  Tract  of %0a%3c Umbria,  and  the  PortTelamon  :  Cossa  Volscientium,  planted %0a%3c by  the  People  of  Rome ;  Graviscae,  Castrum  Novum,  Pyrgi, %0a%3c the  River  Cseretanus,  and  Caere  itself,  standing  four  Miles %0a%3c within ;  Agylla,  named  by  the  Pelasgians,  who  built  it ; %0a%3c Alsium  and  Frugenae.  The  River  Tiber,  distant  from %0a%3c Macra  284  Miles.  Within  are  these  Colonies :  Falisca, %0a%3c descended  from  Argi  (as  Cato  saith),  and  called  Hetrus- %0a%3c corum :  Lucus  Feronise,  Russellana,  Senensis,  and  Sutriva. %0a%3c For  the  rest  :  Aretini  the  Old,  Aretini  Fidentes,  Aretini %0a%3c Julienses,  Amitinenses,  Aquenses,  surnamed  Taurini :  Blerani, %0a%3c Cortonenses,  Capenates,  Clusini  the  Old,  Clusini  the  New, %0a%3c Fluentini,  fast  upon  the  River  Arnus  that  runneth  before %0a%3c them,  Fesulse,  Ferentinum,  Fescennia,  Hortanum,  Herbanum, %0a%3c Nepet,  Novempagi,  Prefectura  Claudia,  Foro  Clodii :  Pis- %0a%3c torium,  Perusia,  Suanenses,  Saturnini,  who  beforetime  were %0a%3c called  Aurinini,  Sudertani,  Statones,  Tarquinienses,  Tus- %0a%3c canienses,  Vetulonienses,  Veientani,  Vesentini,  Volaterrani, %0a%3c surnamed  Hetrusci,  and  Volsinienses.  In  the  same  Part  lie %0a%3c the  Territories  Crustuminus  and  Cseletranus,  bearing  the %0a%3c Names  of  the  old  Towns.  Tiber,  before  named  Tybris, %0a%3c and,  before  that,  Albula,  from  almost  the  middle  of  the %0a%3c Length  of  the  Apennine  runneth  along  the  Borders  of  the %0a%3c Aretini :  small  at  the  first,  and  not  Navigable  without  being %0a%3c gathered  together  by  Fishponds  into  an  Head,  and  so  let %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BOOK  III.]  History  of  Nature.  167 %0a%3c %0a%3c go  :  as  Tinia  and  Glanis,  which  run  into  him ;  and  which %0a%3c require  nine  Days  for  the  collection  of  Waters,  and  so  are  kept %0a%3c in  for  running  if  they  have  no  Help  from  Rain.  But  Tiber, %0a%3c hy  reason  of  the  rough  and  rugged  Channel,  notwithstanding %0a%3c that  Device,  holdeth  on  no  long  Course  together,  but  only %0a%3c for  Troughs,  more  truly  than  Boats ;  and  thus  it  doth  for %0a%3c 150  Miles,  to  not  far  from  Tifernum,  Perusia,  and  Otriculum : %0a%3c dividing  as  it  passeth  Hetruria  from  the  Umbri  and  Sa- %0a%3c bini :  and  presently,  within  thirteen  Miles  of  the  City %0a%3c (Rome),  it  parteth  the  Veientian  country  from  the  Crustu- %0a%3c mine:  and  soon  after,  the  Fidenate  and  Latin  Territories  from %0a%3c the  Labican.  But,  besides  Tinia  and  Glanis,  it  is  augmented %0a%3c with  forty-two  Rivers  ;  and  especially  with  Nar  and  Anio : %0a%3c which  River  being  also  itself  Navigable,  encloseth  Latium %0a%3c from  behind,  and  that  notwithstanding  so  many  Waters %0a%3c and  Fountains  are  brought  thereby  into  the  City  ;  whereby %0a%3c it  is  able  to  receive  large  Ships  from  the  Italian  Sea,  being %0a%3c the  kindest  Merchant  of  Things  growing  in  the  whole  World  : %0a%3c it  is  the  only  River  of  all  others  to  speak  of,  and  more  Vil- %0a%3c lages stand  upon  it  and  see  it,  than  all  other  Rivers  in  any %0a%3c lands  soever.  No  River  hath  less  Liberty  than  it,  as  having %0a%3c the  Sides  thereof  enclosed  on  both  Hands ;  and  yet  he  doth %0a%3c not  resist,  although  he  hath  many  and  sudden  Swellings, %0a%3c and  in  no  Place  more  than  in  the  City  itself  do  his  Waters %0a%3c overflow :  yet  is  he  taken  to  be  a  Prophet  rather,  and  a %0a%3c Counsellor,  and  in  Swelling  more  truly  Religious  than  Cruel. %0a%3c Old  Latium,  from  Tiber  to  Circeios,  was  observed  to  be  in %0a%3c Length  fifty  Miles;  so  slender  were  at  first  the  Roots  of %0a%3c this  Empire.  The  Inhabitants  thereof  changed  often,  and %0a%3c held  it,  some  one  time,  some  another;  that  is,  the  Abo- %0a%3c rigines, Pelasgi,  Arcades,  Siculi,  Aurunci,  and  Rutili.  And %0a%3c beyond  Circeios,  the  Volsci,  Osci,  Ausones,  from  whence  the %0a%3c Name  of  Latium  reached  soon  after,  as  far  as  to  the  River %0a%3c Liris.  In  the  beginning  of  it  standeth  Ostia,  a  Colony, %0a%3c brought  thither  by  a  Roman  King  :  the  Town  Laurentum, %0a%3c the  Grove  of  Jupiter  Indiges,  the  River  Numicius,  and  Ardea, %0a%3c built  by  Dande,  the  Mother  of  Perseus.

The  River  NymphaBUS,  Clostra  Romana,  Circeii1, %0a%3c in  Times  past  an  Island,  environed  with  a  mighty  Sea  (if  we %0a%3c believe  Homer\  but  now  with  a  Plain.  A  Wonder  it  is  what %0a%3c we  are  able  to  deliver  concerning  this  thing,  to  the  know- %0a%3c ledge of  Men.  Theophrastus,  who  of  Foreigners  was  the  first %0a%3c that  wrote  any  Thing  diligently  concerning  the  Romans  (for %0a%3c Theopompus,  before  whom  no  Man  made  any  mention,  said %0a%3c only,  That  the  City  was  taken  by  the  Gauls :  and  Clitarchus %0a%3c next  after  him,  spake  of  nothing  but  an  Embassage  sent %0a%3c to  Alexander} ;  this  Theophraslus^  with  more  certainty  than %0a%3c bare  hearsay,  hath  set  down  the  Measure  of  the  Island %0a%3c Circeii  to  be  eighty  Stadia  ;  in  that  Book  which  he  wrote  to %0a%3c IVicodorus,  the  chief  Magistrate  of  the  Athenians,  who  lived %0a%3c in  the  460th  year  after  the  Foundation  of  our  City.  What- %0a%3c ever Land,  therefore,  above  ten  Miles'  compass,  lieth  near %0a%3c about  it,  hath  been  annexed  to  the  Island.  A  year  after %0a%3c that  another  wonderful  Thing  fell  out  in  It%3csly  :  for  not  far %0a%3c from  Circeii  there  is  a  Pond  called  Pomptina,  which  Mu- %0a%3c tianusy  a  Man  who  had  been  thrice  Consul,  reporteth  to  have %0a%3c been  a  Place  wherein  stood  twenty-three  Cities.  Then  there %0a%3c is  the  River  Ufens,  upon  which  is  the  Town  Terracina, %0a%3c called  in  the  Volscian  tongue  Anxur,  and  where  was  the  City %0a%3c Aioycle,  destroyed  by  Serpents.  After  it  is  the  Place  of  a %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  Cerceia  was  a  town  of  the  Volsci,  on  whose  ruins  is  now  built  the %0a%3c little  village  Santa  Felicita.  Homer  ("  Odyssey,"  K.  194)  represents  it %0a%3c as  the  abode  of  Circe,  and  says  it  was  an  island — %0a%3c %0a%3c "  An  isle  encircled  with  the  boundless  flood." %0a%3c %0a%3c But  the  country  all  around  is  now  one  vast  plain,  and  constitutes  the  well- %0a%3c known  Pontine  Marshes,  which  being  raised  but  little  above  the  level  of %0a%3c the  sea,  may  not  improbably  have  been  once  covered  by  its  waves.  "  If %0a%3c the  traveller  can  spare  a  day,"  says  Eustace  in  his  "  Classical  Tour,"  "  he %0a%3c may  hire  a  boat,  and  sail  along  the  coast  to  the  promontory  of  Circe, %0a%3c which  forms  so  conspicuous  a  figure  in  his  prospect,  and  appears  from %0a%3c Terracina,  as  Homer  and  Virgil  poetically  describe  it,  a  real  island.  As %0a%3c he  ranges  over  its  lofty  cliffs,  he  will  recollect  the  splendid  fictions  of  the %0a%3c one  and  the  harmonious  lines  of  the  other.  He  may  traverse  the  un- %0a%3c frequented groves  ;  but  instead  of  the  palace  of  Circe  he  will  discover  the %0a%3c lonely  village  of  Santa  Felicita,  a  few  solitary  towers  hanging  over  the %0a%3c sea,  and  perhaps  some  faint  traces  of  the  ancient  Cerceia,  covered  with %0a%3c bushes  and  overgrown  with  shrubs." —  Wern.

The  Town %0a%3c Formiae,  named  also  Hormiae,  the  ancient  Seat  (as  Men %0a%3c thought)  of  the  Laestrigones.  Beyond  it  was  the  Town %0a%3c Pyrae,  the  Colony  Minturnae,  divided  by  the  River  Liris, %0a%3c called  Clauius.  The  furthest  Town  in  the  adjoins  of  Latium %0a%3c is  Sinuessa,  which,  as  some  have  said,  was  commonly  called %0a%3c Sinope.  Thence  cometh  the  pleasant  Country  Campania. %0a%3c From  this  Vale  begin  the  Hills  which  are  full  of  Vineyards, %0a%3c and  famous  for  Drunkenness,  proceeding  of  the  Liquor  so %0a%3c celebrated,  commended  in  all  Countries  :  and  (as  they  were %0a%3c wont  to  say  in  old  Time)  there  was  the  chief  Strife  between %0a%3c Father  Liber  and  Ceres.  From  hence  the  Setine  and  Ce- %0a%3c cubine  Countries  spread  forth  :  and  to  them  join  the  Falern %0a%3c and  Calene.  Then  arise  the  Mountains  Massici,  Gaurani, %0a%3c and  Surrentim.  There  the  Laborini  Fields  are  spread  about, %0a%3c and  the  good  Wheat  harvest  to  make  Dainties  at  the  table. %0a%3c The  Sea-coasts  here  are  watered  with  hot  Fountains  ;  and %0a%3c beside. other  Things  through  all  the  Sea,  they  are  famous %0a%3c for  the  rich  purple  Shell-fish1  and  other  excellent  Fishes2. %0a%3c In  no  Place  is  there  better  Oil  from  the  Olive ;  and  this %0a%3c contest  of  Human  pleasure,  the  Osci,  Grecians,  Umbri, %0a%3c Tusci,  and  Campi,  have  held.

And  that  the  enemies  of  Rome  might  not  have  recourse  to  the %0a%3c same  expedient,  it  was  kept ; a  strict  secret  under  the  protection  of  what %0a%3c particular  deity  their  own  city  was  placed.  Valentia  appears  to  have  been %0a%3c the  secret  name,  and  it  was  never  divulged  till  Valerius  Soranus  rashly %0a%3c uttered  it,  and,  as  we  learn  from  Plutarch  (in  "  Quaest.  Rom."  p.  278), %0a%3c uffered  the  punishment  of  his  impiety.

I  think  it  not  amiss  to  insert  in  this %0a%3c Place  an  Example  of  the  ancient  Religion,  instituted  espe- %0a%3c cially for  this  Silence:  for  the  Goddess  Angerona,  to  whom %0a%3c is  sacrificed  on  the  twelfth  Day  before  the  Kalends  of  January, %0a%3c is  represented  by  an  Image  having  her  Mouth  bound  and %0a%3c sealed  up.  The  City  had  three  Gates  when  Romulus  left  it ; %0a%3c or  rather  four  (if  we  believe  most  Men  that  write  thereof), %0a%3c its  Walls,  when  the  two  Vespasians,  Emperors  and  Censors, %0a%3c took  the  Measure,  in  the  Year  after  the  Foundation  of  it, %0a%3c 828,  were  in  circuit  thirteen1  Miles  and  almost  a  quarter. %0a%3c It  containeth  within  it  seven  Mountains,  and  is  divided  into %0a%3c fourteen  Regions  and  265  cross  Streets,  called  Compita %0a%3c Larium.  The  Measure  of  the  same  space  of  Ground,  running %0a%3c from  the  Milliarium,  erected  at  the  Head  of  the  Roman %0a%3c Forum,  to  every  Gate,  which  are  at  this  Day  thirty-seven  in %0a%3c number  (so  ye  reckon  once  the  twelve  Gates  always  open, %0a%3c and  overpass  seven  of  the  old,  which  no  longer  exist2),  maketh %0a%3c thirty  Miles,  three-quarters,  and  a  little  more,  in  a  straight %0a%3c Line :  but  from  the  same  Milliarium  3,  to  the  utmost  ends  of %0a%3c the  Houses,  with  the  Praetorian  Camps,  and  the  clumps %0a%3c (vicos)  of  all  the  Streets,  it  cometh  to  somewhat  above %0a%3c seventy  Miles  :  to  which  if  a  Man  put  the  Height  of  the %0a%3c Houses,  he  may  truly  conceive  by  it  a  worthy  Estimate  of  it, %0a%3c and  confess  that  the  Magnitude  of  no  City  in  the  World %0a%3c %0a%3c altar  dedicated  to  the  Unknown  God;  this  had,  probably,  been  erected %0a%3c with  a  reference  to  the  custom  above-mentioned,  as  there  is  no  reason  for %0a%3c supposing  it  confined  to  the  Romans. —  Wern.

The  Soil  of  Ebusus  chaseth %0a%3c Serpents  away,  but  that  of  Colubraria  breedeth  them ;  and %0a%3c therefore  it  is  Dangerous  for  all  that  come  into  it,  unless  they %0a%3c bring  with  them  some  of  the  Ebusian  earth.  The  Greeks %0a%3c call  this  Island,  Ophiusa.  Neither  doth  Ebusus  produce %0a%3c any  Rabbits ;  which  are  so  common  in  the  Baleares,  that %0a%3c they  eat  up  the  Corn.  There  be  about  twenty  more  little %0a%3c ones  in  the  shallow  Part  of  the  Sea.  But  in  the  Coast  of %0a%3c Gallia,  in  the  Mouth  of  Rhodanus,  there  is  Metina  ;  and %0a%3c soon  after,  that  which  is  called  Blascon  ;  and  the.  three %0a%3c Stoechades,  called  so  by  their  Neighbours  the  Massilians,  for %0a%3c their  Order ;  and  they  give  each  one  a  several  Name,  as %0a%3c Prote,  Mes£  (which  also  is  called  Pornponiana),  and  the %0a%3c third,  Hypea.  After  them,  are  Sturium,  Phrenice,  Phila, %0a%3c Lero,  and  Lerina,  over  against  Antipolis;  wherein  is  a %0a%3c Memorial  of  the  Town  Vergaonum. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BOOK  III.]  History  of  Nature.  1 75 %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  VI. %0a%3c %0a%3c i %0a%3c Of  Corsica. %0a%3c %0a%3c IN  the  Ligurian  Sea  is  Corsica,  which  the  Greeks  called %0a%3c Cyrnos,  but  it  is  nearer  to  the  Tuscan  Sea,  stretching  out %0a%3c from  the  North  into  the  South,  and  in  Length  is  150  Miles : %0a%3c in  Breadth,  for  the  more  Part,  50:  in  Circuit,  322:  it  is %0a%3c distant  from  the  Shallows  of  Volaterrae  62  Miles.  It  hath %0a%3c 35  Cities  :  and  the  Colonies,  Mariana,  planted  by  C.  Marius; %0a%3c Aleria,  by  the  Dictator  Sylla.  On  this  Side  of  it  is  Oglasa ; %0a%3c but  within  60  Miles  of  Corsica  is  Planaria ;  so  called  of  its %0a%3c Form,  which  is  level  with  the  Sea;  and,  therefore,  deceiveth %0a%3c Ships.  Bigger  than  it  are  Urgo  and  Capraria,  which  the %0a%3c Greeks  called  .ZEgilos.  Also,  ^Egilium  and  Danium,  the %0a%3c same  as  Artemisia ;  both  lying  over  against  the  Coast  of %0a%3c Cosanum.  Other  small  ones,  also,  as  Maenaria,  Columbraria, %0a%3c Venaria,  Ilua,  with  the  Iron  Mines,  in  Circuit  100  Miles, %0a%3c 10  Miles  from  Populonia,  called  by  the  Greeks,  .ZEthalia : %0a%3c from  it  is  Planasia,  39  Miles  off.  After  them,  beyond  the %0a%3c Mouths  of  Tiber  in  the  Antian  (Creek),  is  Astura;  and  close %0a%3c by  Palmaria,  Sinonia  ;  and  just  against,  Formias,  Pontiae. %0a%3c But  in  the  Bay  of  Puteolanum,  Pantadaria  and  Prochyta,  so %0a%3c called,  not  of  jEneass  Nurse,  but  because  of  the  gushing  of %0a%3c the  Sea  from  JEnaria.  ^Enaria  itself  took  its  Name  from  the %0a%3c Station  of  the  Ships  of  uEneas  ;  called  by  Homer  Inarime,  by %0a%3c the  Greeks,  Pithecusa;  not  for  the  Number  of  Apes  there,  as %0a%3c some  have  thought,  but  of  the  Work-houses  of  those  that %0a%3c made  earthen  Vessels.  Between  Pausilipus  and  Naples,  Me- %0a%3c garis ;  and  soon  after,  eight  Miles  from  Surrentum,  Capreae, %0a%3c renowned  for  the  Castle  of  the  Prince  Tiberius  ;  in  Circum- %0a%3c ference 400  Miles.  Next,  Leucothea;  and  out  of  Sight  Jieth %0a%3c Sardinia,  close  upon  the  African  Sea,  but  less  than  nine  Miles %0a%3c from  the  Coast  of  Corsica :  and  still  those  Straits  are  made %0a%3c more  narrow  by  reason  of  the  small  Islands  named  Cunicu- %0a%3c larise.  Likewise  Phintonis  and  Fossae,  whereof  the  very %0a%3c Strait  itself  is  named  Taphros. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 1 76  History  of  Nature.

It  is  from  the %0a%3c Cape  of  Caralitanus  to  Africa  200  Miles :  from  Gades,  1400 %0a%3c Miles.  It  hath  two  Islands  on  that  Side  where  the  Promon- %0a%3c tory Gorditanum  standeth  ;  which  be  called  Hercules'  Is- %0a%3c lands :  on  the  Side  of  Sulsensis,  Enosis  ;  of  Caralitanum, %0a%3c Ficaria.  Some  Place  not  far  from  it  the  Islands  Belerides %0a%3c and  Col  1  odes :  and  another  which  they  call  Heras  Lutra,  or %0a%3c Hieraca.  The  most  celebrated  People  therein  are  the  Ilienses, %0a%3c Balari,  and  Corsi :  and  of  the  fourteen  Towns,  the  Sul- %0a%3c citana,  Valentin),  Neapolitan!,  Bosenses,  and  Caralitani,  who %0a%3c are  Roman  Citizens  ;  arid  Norenses.  There  is  one  Colony %0a%3c which  is  called  Ad  Turrim  Libysonis.  This  Island  Sardinia %0a%3c Timceus  called  (from  the  Shape  of  a  Shoe)  Sandaliotis :  but %0a%3c Myrsylus  (from  its  Resemblance  to  a  Footstep),  Ichnusa. %0a%3c Over  against  the  Bay  Psestanum  is  Leucasia,  so  called  from %0a%3c a  Siren  there  buried.  Opposite  Vestia,  lie  Pontia  and  Issia  ; %0a%3c both  jointly  called  by  one  Name,  (Enotides  ;  an  Argument %0a%3c that  Italy  was  possessed  by  the  CEnotrians.  And  opposite %0a%3c Vibo  other  little  ones,  called  Ithacesise,  the  Watch-places  of %0a%3c Ulysses. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  VIII. %0a%3c Of  Sicily. %0a%3c %0a%3c BUT  Sicily  excelleth  all  other  of  these  Islands.  It  is %0a%3c named  by  Thucydides,  Sicania ;  by  many,  Trinacria,  or  Tri- %0a%3c quetra,  from  its  triangular  Form.  It  is  in  Circuit  (as  Agrippa %0a%3c saith)  198  Miles.  In  Times  past  it  was  joined  to  the  Bru- %0a%3c tians'  Country ;  but  soon  after,  by  the  Rush  of  the  Sea,  it %0a%3c was  torn  from  it,  and  a  Strait  was  left  of  12  Miles  in %0a%3c Length,  and  one  and  a  half  in  Breadth,  near  the  Column %0a%3c Rhegium.  Upon  this  Occasion  of  opening,  the  Greeks  gave %0a%3c a  Name  to  the  Town  Rhegiurn,  situated  on  the  Edge  sf  Italy. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BOOK  III.]  History  of  Nature.  177 %0a%3c %0a%3c In  this  Strait  is  the  Rock  called  Scylla,  and  likewise  another %0a%3c named  Charybdis :  the  Sea  is  full  of  Whirlpools,  and  both %0a%3c those  Rocks  are  notorious  for  their  Rage.     The  utmost  Cape %0a%3c of  this  Island  Triquetra  (as  we  have  said)  is  called  Pelorus, %0a%3c projecting  against  Scylla  toward  Italy.     Pachynum  lieth  to- %0a%3c ward Graecia,  and  from  it  Peloponnesus  is  distant  144  Miles. %0a%3c Lilybaeum  lieth  toward  Africa,  and  between  it  and  the  Cape %0a%3c of  Mercury  there  are  180  Miles  :  and  from  the  said  Lilybaeum %0a%3c to  the  Cape  of  Caraleis  in  Sardinia,  120.     Now  these  Pro- %0a%3c montories and  Sides  lie  one  from  the  other  at  this  Distance : %0a%3c by  Land,  from  Pelorus  to  Pachynum,  166  Miles  :  from  thence %0a%3c to  Lilybaeum,  200  Miles :  so  forward  to  Pelorus,  170.     In  it, %0a%3c of  Colonies,  Towns,    and    Cities,    there   are   72.      Beyond %0a%3c Pelorus,  which  looketh  toward  the  Ionian  Sea,  is  the  Town %0a%3c Messana,  inhabited  by  Roman  Citizens,  which  are  called %0a%3c Mamertini.      Also  the  Cape  Drepanum  ;  the  Colony  Tau- %0a%3c rominium,  formerly   called  Naxos;  the   River  Asines;   the %0a%3c Mountain  ^Etna,  wonderful  for  its  Fires  in  the  Night ;  the %0a%3c Cavity  (Crater)  of  it  is  in  Compass  two  Miles  and  a  half; %0a%3c the  burning  Ashes  thereof  fly  as  far  as  to  Taurominium  and %0a%3c Catana :  but  its  crashing  Noise  may  be  heard  as  far  as  to %0a%3c Maron,  and  the  Hills  Gemellis.     There  are  also,  the  three %0a%3c Rocks   of  the  Cyclops ;    the    Port  of  Ulysses,  the   Colony %0a%3c Catana ;  the  Rivers  Symethum  and  Terias :  within  the  Isle %0a%3c the  Fields  Laestrigonii.

But  on  this  Side  Sicily,  opposite  the %0a%3c River  Metaurus,  about  12  Miles  from  Italy,  seven  others %0a%3c called  JEoliae.  The  same  Islands  belonged  to  the  Liparaei, %0a%3c and  by  the  Greeks  were  called  Hephaestiades,  and  by  our %0a%3c People,  Vulcaniae ;  ^oliae,  also,  because  ^Eohts  reigned  there %0a%3c in  the  Time  that  Ilium  flourished. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  IX. %0a%3c Of  Lipara. %0a%3c %0a%3c LIPARA,  with  a  Town  of  Roman  Citizens,  so  called  from %0a%3c King  Liparus,  who  succeeded  ^Eolus,  but  before  that  named %0a%3c Melogonis,  or  Meligunis,  is  twelve  Miles  from  Italy ;  and  is %0a%3c itself  somewhat  less  in  Circuit.  Between  it  and  Sicily  there %0a%3c is  another,  formerly  named  Therasia,  now  Hiera,  because  it %0a%3c is  sacred  to  Vulcan,  wherein  there  is  a  Hill  that  casteth  up %0a%3c Flames  in  the  Night.  A  third  is  named  Strongyl£,  a  Mile %0a%3c from  Lipara,  lying  toward  the  Sun-rising,  wherein  JEolus %0a%3c reigned  ;  and  it  differeth  from  Lipara  only  in  that  it  sendeth %0a%3c forth  more  lively  Flames  :  by  the  Smoke  thereof  the  People %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BOOK  III.]  History  of  Nature.  179 %0a%3c %0a%3c of  that  Country  are  said  to  tell,  three  Days  before-hand1, %0a%3c what  Winds  will  blow  :  from  whence  it  is  commonly  thought, %0a%3c that  the  Winds  were  obedient  to  JEolus.  A  fourth  is  named %0a%3c Didym&,  less  than  Lipara  :  and  a  fifth,  Ericusa  :  a  sixth, %0a%3c Phoenicusa,  left  to  feed  the  Rest  that  are  next  to  it :  the  last %0a%3c and  least  is  Euonymus.  And  thus  much  concerning  the  first %0a%3c Gulf  that  divideth  Europe. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  X. %0a%3c Of  Locri,  the  Front  of  Italy. %0a%3c %0a%3c AT  Locri  beginneth  the  Front  of  Italy,  called  Magna %0a%3c Graecia,  retiring  itself  into  three  Bays  of  the  Ausonian  Sea ; %0a%3c because  the  Ausones  first  occupied  it.  It  extendeth  eighty- %0a%3c two  Miles,  as  Varro  testifieth ;  but  the  greater  Number  of %0a%3c Writers  have  made  it  but  seventy-two.  In  that  Coast  are %0a%3c Rivers  without  Number;  but  the  Things  which  are  worth %0a%3c the  writing  of  near  Locri,  are  these  :  Sagra,  and  the  Vestiges %0a%3c of  the  Town  Caulon  :  Mystia,  the  Camp  Consilinum,  Cerin- %0a%3c thus,  which  some  think  to  be  the  longest  Promontory  of %0a%3c Italy.  Then  the  Bay  of  Scylaceum,  which  was  called  by  the %0a%3c Athenians,  when  they  built  it,  Scylletium.  Which  Place  the %0a%3c Bay  Terinaeus  meeting  with,  maketh  a  Peninsula :  in  which %0a%3c there  is  a  Port  called  Castra  Annibilis :  and  in  no  Place  is %0a%3c Italy  narrower,  being  but  twenty  Miles  broad.  And,  therefore, %0a%3c Dionysius  the  Elder  wished  to  have  there  cut  it  off,  and %0a%3c added  it  to  Sicily.  Rivers  navigable  there :  Caecinos,  Cro- %0a%3c talus,  Semirus,  Arocha,  Targines.  Within  is  the  Town  Pe- %0a%3c tilia,  the  Mountain  Alibanus,  and  the  Promontory  Lacinium  : %0a%3c before  the  Coast  of  which  is  an  Island  ten  Miles  from  the %0a%3c Land,  called  Dioscoron ;  and  another  Calypsus,  which  Homer %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  Wheelwright,  in  his  translation  of  Pindar,  thinks  the  following  lines %0a%3c from  the  seventh  Nemean  Ode  refer  to  the  circumstance  mentioned  by %0a%3c Pliny  :— %0a%3c %0a%3c "  Three  days  ere  yet  the  tempest  rise, %0a%3c The  skilful  mariner  descries,"  &c. %0a%3c %0a%3c Wern.

In  it  is  the  Town  Croto,  and  the %0a%3c River  Naeathus.  The  Town  Thurium,  between  the  two %0a%3c Rivers,  Arathis  and  Sybaris ;  where  there  was  a  Town  of  the %0a%3c same  Name.  Likewise,  between  Siris  and  Aciris  there %0a%3c standeth  Heraclea,  once  called  Siris.  Rivers,  Acalandrum, %0a%3c Masuentum  ;  the  Town  Metapontum,  in  which  the  third %0a%3c Region  of  Italy  endeth.  The  inland  Inhabitants,  the  Aprus- %0a%3c tani  only,  are  of  the  Brutians  :  but  of  the  Lucani,  Thoati- %0a%3c nates,  Bantini,  Eburini,  Grumentini,  Potentini,  Sontini, %0a%3c Sirini,  Tergilani,  Ursentini,  Volcentani,  to  whom  the  Nu- %0a%3c mestrani  are  joined.  Besides  these,  Cato  writeth,  that  Thebes %0a%3c of  the  Lucani  hath  perished.  And  Theopompus  saith,  that %0a%3c Pandosia  was  a  City  of  the  Lucani,  wherein  Alexander  the %0a%3c Epirote  was  slain.  Attached  to  it  is  the  second  Region, %0a%3c containing  within  it  the  Hirpini,  Calabria,  Apulia,  and  the %0a%3c Salentini,  within  a  Bay,  in  Compass  250  Miles ;  which  is %0a%3c called  Tarentinus,  from  a  Town  of  the  Laconi,  situated  in %0a%3c the  Recess :  and  to  it  was  annexed  the  maritime  Colony %0a%3c which  was  there  :  it  is  distant  from  the  Promontory  Laci- %0a%3c nium 136  Miles  ;  putting  forth  Calabria  into  a  Peninsula %0a%3c against  it.  The  Greeks  called  it  Messapia,  from  the  Name %0a%3c of  a  Leader,  and  before  this,  Peucetia,  of  Peucetius,  the  bro- %0a%3c ther of  CEnotrus.  In  the  Salentine  Country,  between  the %0a%3c Promontories,  there  is  the  Distance  of  100  Miles.  The %0a%3c Breadth  of  this  Peninsula,  from  Tarentum  to  Brundisium,  by %0a%3c Land,  is  two-and-thirty  Miles  ;  but  far  shorter  from  the  Port %0a%3c Sasina.  The  Towns  in  the  Continent  from  Tarentum,  are %0a%3c Varia,  surnamed  Apula,  Cessapia  and  Aletium.

Two-and-thirty  Miles  off  is  the  Promontory %0a%3c which  they  call  Acra  Japygia,  from  which  Italy  runneth %0a%3c furthest  into  the  Sea.  Beyond  it  is  the  Town  of  Basta,  and %0a%3c Hydruntum,  the  Space  of  nineteen  Miles,  to  make  a  Par- %0a%3c tition between  the  Ionian  and  the  Adriatic  Sea ;  through %0a%3c which  is  the  shortest  Passage  into  Greece,  over  against  the %0a%3c Town  of  Apollonia  ;  where  the  Strait  running  between  is  not %0a%3c above  fifty  Miles  over.  This  Space  between,  Pyrrhus  King %0a%3c of  Epirus,  intending  to  have  a  Passage  over  on  Foot,  first %0a%3c thought  to  make  Bridges  across  :  after  him,  M.  Varro,  at  the %0a%3c Time  when  in  the  Pirates'  War,  he  was  Admiral  of  Pompeys %0a%3c Fleet.  But  both  of  them  were  stopped  by  other  Cares.  Next  to %0a%3c Hydrus,  is  Soletum,  a  City  not  inhabited  :  then,  Fratuertium  : %0a%3c the  Port  Tarentinus,  the  Garrison  Town  Lupia,  Balesium, %0a%3c Caelium,  Brundusium,  fifteen  Miles  from  Hydrus,  much  re- %0a%3c nowned among  the  chief  Towns  of  Italy  for  the  Harbour, %0a%3c especially  for  the  surer  sailing,  although  it  be  the  longer ; %0a%3c and  the  City  of  lllyricum  Dyrrhagium  is  ready  to  receive  the %0a%3c Ships  :  the  Passage  over  is  220  Miles.  Upon  Brundusium %0a%3c bordereth  the  Territory  of  the  Psediculi.  Nine  young  Men %0a%3c there  were  of  them,  and  as  many  Maids,  descended  from  the %0a%3c Illyrians,  who  begat  thirteen  Nations.

Also  Valerianus  reporteth,  that  a %0a%3c Town  of  the  Vidicini  in  Picenum  was  utterly  destroyed  by %0a%3c the  Romans.  The  Sabini,  as  some  have  thought,  were,  for %0a%3c their  Religion  and  worship  of  the  Gods,  called  Seveni :  they %0a%3c dwell  close  by  the  Veline  Lakes,  upon  the  dewy  Hills.

The %0a%3c Siculi  and  Liburni  possessed  most  Parts  of  that  Tract,  and %0a%3c principally  the  Territories  Palmensis,  Prsetutianus,  and %0a%3c Adrianus.  Them  the  Umbrii  expelled  :  these  Etruria,  and %0a%3c these  again  the  Galli.  The  People  of  Umbria  are  supposed, %0a%3c of  all  Italy,  to  be  of  greatest  Antiquity ;  as  being  they  whom %0a%3c Men  think  to  have  been  by  the  Greeks  named  Ombri,  be- %0a%3c cause in  the  Deluge  of  the  Country  by  Rain,  they  only  re- %0a%3c mained alive.

By  the %0a%3c Greeks  it  was  called  Eridanus,  and  well  known  for  the %0a%3c Punishment  of  Phaeton.  It  increaseth  about  the  Rising  of %0a%3c the  Dog-star,  by  Reason  of  the  melting  Snow :  more  violent %0a%3c to  the  Fields  thereby,  than  to  the  Vessels  :  nevertheless, %0a%3c nothing  is  stolen  away  to  itself;  but  when  it  hath  left  the %0a%3c Fields,  its  Bounty  is  more  abundant  by  their  Fruitfulness : %0a%3c from  its  Head  it  holdeth  on  its  Course  300  Miles,  adding,  for %0a%3c its  meandering,  88  Miles.  It  receiveth  not  only  the  navi- %0a%3c gable Rivers  of  the  Apennines  and  the  Alps,  but  large  Lakes %0a%3c also  that  discharge  themselves  into  it :  so  that  in  all  it  car- %0a%3c rieth  into  the  Adriatic  Sea,  30  Rivers.  The  most  celebrated %0a%3c of  them  are  these,  sent  out  of  the  Side  of  Apennine  :  Tanarus, %0a%3c Trebia,  Placentinus,  Tarus,  Nicia,  Gabellus,  Scultenna,  Rhe- %0a%3c nus.  But  running  out  of  the  Alps,  Stura,  Morgns,  two %0a%3c Duriae,  Sessites,  Ticinus,  Lambrus,  Addua,  Olius,  and  Min- %0a%3c cius.  And  there  is  no  River  that  in  so  little  Way  groweth  to %0a%3c a  greater  Stream  ;  because  it  is  driven  on  with  the  Mass  of %0a%3c Water,  and  stirred  to  the  Bottom,  heavy  to  the  Earth,  al- %0a%3c though it  be  drawn  into  Rivers  and  Trenches  between  Ra- %0a%3c venna and  Ativum,  for  120  Miles  :  yet  because  it  casteth %0a%3c them  out  in  great  Abundance,  it  is  said  to  make  seven %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  Pliny  tells  us  (lib.  ii.  106)  that  this  wonderful  spring  ceased  to  flow %0a%3c at  mid-day  in  the  summer  season.  Under  the  modern  name  of  Po,  this %0a%3c river  is  not  less  celebrated  than  in  ancient  times. —  Wern.

It  is  drawn  to  Ravenna  by  a  narrow  Channel,  where %0a%3c it  is  called  Padusa,  and  in  Times  past,  Messanicus.  The %0a%3c next  Mouth  that  he  maketh  from  thence,  carrieth  the  Big- %0a%3c ness of  a  Harbour,  which  is  named  Vatreni :  at  which  Clau- %0a%3c dius Ctesar,  as  he  came  triumphant  from  Britain,  entered %0a%3c into  Adria,  with  that  Vessel,  more  like  a  huge  House  than  a %0a%3c Ship.  This  Mouth  of  it  was  formerly  called  Eridanum :  by %0a%3c others,  Spineticum,  from  the  neighbouring  City  Spinae,  built %0a%3c by  Diomedes  (as  some  think),  with  the  Treasures  of  Delphi. %0a%3c There  the  River  Vatrenus,  from  out  of  the  Territory  of %0a%3c Forum  Cornelii,  increaseth  Padus.  The  next  Mouth  is %0a%3c Caprasise,  then  Sagis,  then  Volane,  which  before  was  named %0a%3c Olane.  All  those  Rivers  and  Trenches,  the  Thusci  were  the %0a%3c first  to  make  out  of  Sagis,  carrying  the  forcible  Stream  of  the %0a%3c River  across  into  the  Atrian  Ponds,  which  are  called  the  seven %0a%3c Seas ;  and  they  made  the  famous  Harbour  of  Atria,  a  Town %0a%3c of  the  Thusci ;  of  which  the  Atriatic  Sea  took  the  Name %0a%3c aforetime  ;  which  now  is  called  Adriaticum.  From  thence %0a%3c are  the  full  Mouths  of  Carbonaria,  and  the  Fosses  Phylis- %0a%3c tinse,  which  others  call  Tartarus  ;  but  all  spring  out  of  the %0a%3c overflowing  of  the  Foss  Phylistina,  with  Athesis  coming  out  of %0a%3c the  Tridentine  Alps,  and  Togisonus  out  of  the  Territory  of  the %0a%3c Patavini.  Part  of  them  made  also  the  next  Port  Brundulum  : %0a%3c like  as  the  two  Medoaci  and  the  Foss  Clodia,  make  Edron. %0a%3c With  these  Padus  mingleth  itself,  and  by  these  it  runneth %0a%3c over ;  and,  as  it  is  said  by  most  Writers,  like  as  in  Egypt %0a%3c Nilus  maketh  that  which  they  call  Delta,  so  it  shapeth  a %0a%3c triangular  Figure  between  the  Alps  and  the  Sea-coast,  two %0a%3c Miles  in  Compass.  It  is  a  Shame  to  borrow  from  the  Greeks %0a%3c the  Explanation  of  Things  in  Italy  :  but  Metrodorus  Scepsius %0a%3c saith,  that  because  about  the  Head  of  this  River  there  grow %0a%3c many  Pitch  Trees,  called  in  the  Gallic  Language,  Pades, %0a%3c therefore  it  took  the  Name  of  Padus.  Also,  that  in  the %0a%3c Ligurian  Language,  the  River  itself  is  called  Bodincus, %0a%3c which  means  bottomless.  And  to  approve  this  Argument, %0a%3c there  is  a  neighbouring  Town  called  Industria,  but  by  an  old %0a%3c Name,  Bodincomagum ;  where  beginneth  its  greatest  Depth. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 188  History  of  Nature.

Which  Corne- %0a%3c lius Alexander  sheweth  to  have  descended  from  the  Greeks; %0a%3c and  this  by  the  Interpretation  of  their  Name,  which  signi- %0a%3c fieth,  Men  living  in  Mountains.  In  this  Tract,  Barra,  a %0a%3c Town  of  the  Orobians,  is  perished  ;  from  whence,  Cato  saith, %0a%3c the  Bergomates  took  their  Beginning  ;  discovering  by  their %0a%3c Name,  that  they  were  seated  more  highly  than  happily. %0a%3c There  are  perished  also  the  Caturiges,  banished  Persons  of %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  Pliny  says,  the  eleventh  region;  and  he  may  be  accurate  according %0a%3c to  his  original  authority:  which  was  a  survey  ordered  by  Augustus %0a%3c Caesar,  and  in  some  measure  equivalent  to  the  English  Domesday  survey. %0a%3c This  measure  of  the  emperor  may  be,  perhaps,  the  same  that  is  referred %0a%3c to  by  St.  Luke,  ii.  1.  But  in  Pliny's  order  of  reckoning  it  is  only  the %0a%3c ninth  region. — Wern.

Also,  Melpum, %0a%3c a  Town  remarkable  for  Wealth ;  which,  as  Nepos  Cornelius %0a%3c hath  written,  was  by  the  tnsubres,  Boii,  and  Senones,  razed %0a%3c on  that  very  Day  on  which  Camillus  took  Veii. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  XVIII. %0a%3c Venetia,  the  tenth  Region. %0a%3c %0a%3c Now  followeth  the  tenth  Region  of  Italy,  Venetia,  lying %0a%3c upon  the  Adriatic  Sea  :  the  River  whereof,  Silis,  cometh  from %0a%3c the  Mountains  Taurisani :  also  the  Town  Altinum,  the  River %0a%3c Liquentia,  issuing  from  the  Mountains  Opitergeni ;  and  a %0a%3c Harbour  of  the  same  Name;  the  Colony  Concordia.  Rivers %0a%3c and  Havens :  Romatinum,  Tilaventum,  the  greater  and  the %0a%3c less  :  Anassum,  by  which  Varranus  runneth  down  :  Alsa, %0a%3c Natiso,  with  Turrus,  running  by  Aquileia,  a  Colony  situated %0a%3c 12  Miles  from  the  Sea.  This  is  the  Region  of  the  Carni, %0a%3c joining  that  of  Japides :  the  River  Timavus,  and  the  Castle %0a%3c Pucinum,  famous  for  good  Wine.  The  Bay  Tergestinus,  the %0a%3c Colony  Tergeste,  23  Miles  from  Aquileia  :  beyond  which  six %0a%3c Miles,  is  the  River  Formio,  189  Miles  from  Ravenna:  the %0a%3c ancient  Limit  of  Italy  enlarged,  but  at  this  Day  of  Istria, %0a%3c which  they  report,  was  so  named  of  the  River  Ister,  flowing %0a%3c out  of  the  River  Danubius  into  Adria  :  and  over  against  the %0a%3c same  Ister,  the  Mouth  of  Padus :  by  the  contrary  rushing %0a%3c Streams  of  which  two  Rivers,  the  Sea  between  beginneth  to %0a%3c be  more  mild ;  as  many  Authors  have  reported,  but  untruly  ; %0a%3c and  Cornelius  Nepos,  also,  although  he  dwelt  just  by  Padus  : %0a%3c for  there  is  no  River  that  runneth  out  of  Danubius  into  the %0a%3c Adriatic  Sea.  They  were  deceived  (1  suppose),  because  the %0a%3c Ship  Argos1  went  down  a  River  into  the  Adriatic  Sea,  not  far %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  The  Argonauts  embarked  at  Jolcos,  in  Thessaly,  and  steered  first  to %0a%3c Lemnos :  from  whence,  after  many  adventures,  they  reached  the  Phasis, %0a%3c which  flows  through  Colchis  into  the  Black  Sea.    It  would  be  no  easy %0a%3c task  to  point  out  the  course  they  took  on  their  return.    Pindar,  in  the %0a%3c Fourth  Pythian  Ode,  makes  them  pass  the  Erythraean  Sea— %0a%3c "  Then  mingling  in  the  ocean  deep, %0a%3c The  Erythraean  Sea  they  sweep." %0a%3c By  the  Erythraean  Sea  the  Indian  Ocean  is  to  be  understood,  through %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 190  History  of  Nature.  [BOOK  III. %0a%3c %0a%3c from  Tergeste;  but  what  River  it  was,  is  unknown.  The %0a%3c more  diligent  Enquirers  say,  that  it  was  carried  upon  Men's %0a%3c Shoulders  over  the  Alps  :  and  that  it  was  embarked  into %0a%3c Ister,  and  so  into  Saus,  and  then  Nauportus,  which  upon %0a%3c that  occasion  took  his  Name,  which  riseth  between  ^Emona %0a%3c and  the  Alps. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER   XIX. %0a%3c Istria. %0a%3c %0a%3c ISTRIA  runneth  out  like  a  Peninsula.  Some  have  deli- %0a%3c vered, that  it  is  40  Miles  broad,  and  122  Miles  in  Circuit. %0a%3c The  like  they  say  of  Liburnia  adjoining  to  it,  and  of  the  Bay %0a%3c Flanaticus.  But  others  say,  that  the  Circuit  of  Liburnia  is %0a%3c 180  Miles.  Some  have  set  out  Japidia  to  the  Bay  Flanaticus, %0a%3c behind  Istria,  130  Miles  :  and  so  have  made  Liburnia  in  Cir- %0a%3c cuit 150  Miles.  TuditanuSj  who  subdued  the  Istri,  upon  his %0a%3c own  Statue  there  set  this  Inscription  :  from  Aquileia  to %0a%3c the  River  Titius,  are  200  Stadia.  The  Towns  in  Istria,  of %0a%3c Roman  Citizens,  are  ^Egida  and  Parentium.  A  Colony  there %0a%3c is,  Pola,  now  called  Pietas  Julia ;  built  in  old  Time  by  the %0a%3c Colchii.  It  is  from  Tergeste,  100  Miles.  Soon  after,  the %0a%3c Town  Nesactium,  and  the  River  Arsia,  now  the  Bound  of %0a%3c Italy.  From  Ancona  to  Pola,  there  is  a  Passage  over  the %0a%3c Sea  of  120  Miles.  In  the  Midland  Part  of  this  tenth  Region %0a%3c are  the  Colonies,  Cremona  and  Brixia,  in  the  Country  of %0a%3c the  Cenomanni :  but  in  the  Country  of  the  Veneti,  Ateste. %0a%3c Also  the  Towns  Acelum,  Patavium,  Opitergium,  Belunum, %0a%3c Vicetia :  Mantua  of  the  Tusci,  the  only  Place  left  beyond %0a%3c the  Padus.  That  the  Veneti  were  the  Offspring  of  the  Tro- %0a%3c %0a%3c which  it  seems  they  came  into  Africa,  and  when  arrived  on  land,  carrying %0a%3c the  ship  on  their  shoulders  until  they  came  to  the  Tritoniari  Lake,  they %0a%3c sailed  into  the  Mediterranean,  and  touched  at  Thera;  thence  through %0a%3c the  Ocean  they  came  to  the  island  of  Lemnos.  —  (See  Wheelwright's %0a%3c "  Pindar.")  But  a  more  probable  course  would  be  one  approaching  that %0a%3c given  by  Pliny  in  the  text.  The  whole  story  of  the  Argonauts,  how- %0a%3c ever, having,  in  the  lapse  of  time,  become  a  mere  fable,  it  is  not  worth  the %0a%3c attempt  to  illustrate  it. —  Wern.

Fertini,  Tridentini,  and %0a%3c Bernenses,  are  Towns  of  Rhetia.  Verona  is  of  the  Rheti  and %0a%3c Euganei;  Julienses  of  the  Garni.  Then  follow  these,  whom %0a%3c we  need  to  use  no  Strictness  in  naming ;  Alutruenses,  Asse- %0a%3c riates,  Flamonienses,  Vannienses,  and  others  surnamed %0a%3c Gulici :  Foro  Julienses,  surnamed  Transpadani :  Foretani, %0a%3c Venidates,  Querqueni,  Taurisani,  Togienses,  Varvani.  In %0a%3c this  Tract  there  have  perished  in  the  Borders,  Itamine,  Pel- %0a%3c laon,  Palsicium.  Of  the  Veneti,  Atina  and  Caelina :  of  the %0a%3c Garni,  Segeste  and  Ocra :  and  of  the  Taurissi,  Noreia.  Also %0a%3c from  Aquileia  twelve  Miles,  there  was  a  Town  destroyed  by %0a%3c M.  Claudius  Marcellus,  in  spite  of  the  Senate,  as  L.  Piso %0a%3c hath  recorded.  In  this  Region  there  are  also  ten  remarkable %0a%3c Lakes  and  Rivers,  either  issuing  forth  of  them  as  their  Off- %0a%3c spring, or  else  maintained  by  them,  if  they  send  them  out %0a%3c again,  when  they  have  received  them :  as  Larius  doth  Addua, %0a%3c Verbanus  Ticinus,  Benacus  Mincius,  Sebinus  Ossius,  Eupi- %0a%3c lius  Lamber,  all  seated  in  the  Padus.  The  Alps  reach  in %0a%3c Length  ten  Miles  from  the  upper  Sea  to  the  lower,  as  Ccdius %0a%3c saith :  Timogenes,  two-and-twenty :  but  Cornelius  Nepos,  in %0a%3c Breadth  100  Miles  :  T.  Livius  saith,  3000  Stadia.  But  both %0a%3c of  them  take  Measure  in  different  Places ;  for  sometimes  they %0a%3c exceed  100  Miles,  where  they  separate  Germany  from  Italy : %0a%3c and  in  other  Parts  they  are  so  narrow,  that  they  make  not %0a%3c full  out  three  score  and  ten  Miles  ;  as  if  by  the  Provi- %0a%3c dence of  Nature.  The  Breadth  of  Italy,  from  Varus  under %0a%3c the  Foot  of  them  through  the  Shallows  of  Sabatia,  the  Tau- %0a%3c rini,  Comus,  Brixia,  Verona,  Vicetia,  Opitergium,  Aquileia, %0a%3c Tergeste",  Pola,  and  Aristia,  maketh  702  Miles. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  XX. %0a%3c Of  the  Alps  and  Alpine  Nations. %0a%3c %0a%3c MANY  Nations  inhabit  the  Alps,  but  those  of  special %0a%3c Name,  from  Pola  to  the  Tract  of  Tergestis,  are  these  :  the %0a%3c Secusses,  Subocrini,  Catili,  Menocaleni :  and  near  to  the %0a%3c Garni,  those  who  in  Times  past  were  called  Taurisci,  but %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 192  History  of  Nature.  [Boox  III. %0a%3c %0a%3c now  Norici.  To  these  are  Neighbours  the  Rheti  and  Vin- %0a%3c delici,  all  divided  into  many  Cities.  The  Rheti  are  judged %0a%3c to  be  descended  from  the  Thusci,  driven  out  by  the  Galli, %0a%3c with  their  Leader  Rhcetus1.  But  turning  our  Breast  to  Italy, %0a%3c we  meet  with  the  Euganean  Nations  of  the  Alps,  who  en- %0a%3c joyed the  Right  of  the  Latins,  and  whose  Towns  Cato  reck- %0a%3c oneth  to  the  number  of  four  and  thirty.  Of  them,  the %0a%3c Triumpilini,  both  People  and  Lands,  were  sold.  After  them %0a%3c the  Camuni,  and  many  such,  were  annexed  to  the  next  Muni- %0a%3c cipii.  The  Lepontii  and  the  Salassi,  Cato  thinketh  to  be  of %0a%3c the  Tauric  Nation.  But  almost  all  others  suppose  that  the %0a%3c Lepontici  were  a  Residue  left  behind  of  the  Companions  of %0a%3c Hercules ,  through  the  interpretation  of  the  Greek  Name,  as %0a%3c having  their  Members  burned  with  the  Alpine  snows  as  they %0a%3c passed  through  :  that  the  Graii  likewise  were  of  the  same %0a%3c Company,  planted  in  the  Passage,  and  inhabiting  the  Alps %0a%3c Graiae :  also  that  the  Euganei  were  noblest  in  Birth,  from %0a%3c which  they  took  their  Name.  The  Head  of  them  is  Stonos. %0a%3c Of  those  Rhoeti  the  Vennonetes  and  Sarunetes  inhabit  the %0a%3c Heads  of  the  River  Rhenus  :  and  of  the  Leponti,  those  who %0a%3c are  called  Viberi  dwell  by  the  Fountain  of  Rhodanus,  in %0a%3c the  same  quarter  of  the  Alps.  There  be  also  Inhabitants %0a%3c within  the  Alps  endowed  with  the  Liberty  of  Latium :  as %0a%3c the  Octodurenses,  and  their  Borderers  the  Centrones,  the %0a%3c Cottian  Cities.  The  Caturiges,  and  the  Vagienni,  from %0a%3c them  descended  ;  Ligures,  and  such  as  are  called  the  Moun- %0a%3c taineers :  and  many  kinds  of  the  Capillati,  on  the  Borders %0a%3c of  the  Ligusticus  Sea.  In  seemeth  not  amiss  in  this  Place %0a%3c to  set  down  an  Inscription  out  of  a  Trophy  erected  in %0a%3c the  Alps,  which  runneth  in  this  Form  :  To  the  Emperor %0a%3c Caesar,  Son  o/Divus  Augustus,  Pontifex  Maximus,  Imperator %0a%3c fourteen  Times,  and  invested  with  the  Authority  of  the %0a%3c Tribune  seventeen  Times  :  the  Senate  and  People  of  Rome  : %0a%3c For  that  under  his  Conduct  and  Auspices,  all  the  Alpine %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  Justin,  xx.  5,  p.  181,  says,  "  The  Tusci,  with  their  leader  Koetus, %0a%3c having  lost  their  ancient  territorial  possessions,  took  possession  of  the %0a%3c Alps,  and  laid  the  foundation  of  the  nation  of  the  Roeti,  so  called  after  the %0a%3c name  of  their  leader." —  Wern.

The %0a%3c Alpine  Nations  subdued:  Triumpilini,  Camuni,  Vennonetes, %0a%3c Isarci,  Breuni,  Naunes,  and  Focunates.

The  Promontory %0a%3c Nymphgeum,  in  the  Coast,  keepeth  the  name  :  also  Lissum, %0a%3c a  Town  of  Roman  Citizens,  100  Miles  from  Epidaurum. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  XXIII. %0a%3c Macedonia. %0a%3c %0a%3c FROM  Lissum  is  the  Province  of  Macedonia  :  the  Nations %0a%3c there  are  the  Partheni,  and  on  their  Back,  the  Dassaretes. %0a%3c The  Mountains  of  Candavia  seventy-nine  Miles  from  Dyr- %0a%3c rhachium.  But  in  the  Borders,  Denda,  a  Town  of  Roman %0a%3c Citizens;  also  the  Colony  Epidamnum2,  which,  for  that %0a%3c inauspicious  Name,  was  by  the  Romans  called  Dyrrhachium. %0a%3c The  River  Aous,  named  of  some  ^Eas ;  Apollonia,  once  a %0a%3c Colony  of  the  Corinthians,  seven  Miles  from  the  Sea ; %0a%3c in  the  Recesses  of  which  is  the  famous  Nymphaeum3.  The %0a%3c Foreigners  inhabiting  about  it  are  the  Amantes  and  Bu- %0a%3c liones;  but  in  the  Borders,  the  Town  Oricum,  built  by  the %0a%3c Colchi.

Their %0a%3c Towns  are  Virunum,  Celeia,  Teurnia,  Aguntum,  Viana, %0a%3c ^Emona,  Claudia,  Flavium,  Tolvense.  Near  the  Norici  are %0a%3c the  Lake  Peiso,  the  Deserts  of  the  Boii.  Nevertheless  now, %0a%3c by  the  Colony  of  Divus  Claudius,  Salaria,  and  by  the  Town %0a%3c Scarabantia  Julia,  they  are  inhabited. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  XXV. %0a%3c Pannonia. %0a%3c %0a%3c THENCE  beginneth  Mast-bearing  Pannonia:  from  which %0a%3c the  Crags  of  the  Alps,  becoming  more  Smooth,  turn  through %0a%3c the  midst  of  Illyricum  from  the  North  to  the  South,  and %0a%3c settle  lower  by  an  easy  Descent,  both  on  the  right  Hand  and %0a%3c the  left.  That  Part  which  looks  toward  the  Adriatic  Sea  is %0a%3c called  Dalmatia,  and  Illyricum,  above-named.  Pannonia %0a%3c bendeth  toward  the  North,  and  is  bounded  with  the  River %0a%3c Danubius.  In  it  are  these  Colonies  :  ^Emonia,  Siscia.  And %0a%3c these  remarkable  and  navigable  Rivers  run  into  Danubius  : %0a%3c Draus,  with  more  Violence,  out  of  the  Noric  Alps ;  and %0a%3c Saus  out  of  the  Carnic  Alps  more  gently,  115  Miles  between. %0a%3c Draus  passeth  through  the  Serretes,  Serrapilli,  Jasi,  and %0a%3c Sandrozetes:  Saus  through  the  Colapiani  and  Breuci.  And %0a%3c these  be  the  chief  of  the  People.  Moreover,  the  Arivates, %0a%3c Azali,  Amantes,  Belgites,  Catari,  Corneates,  Aravisci,  Her- %0a%3c cuniates,  Latovici,  Oseriates,  and  Varciani.

The  Island  in  Saus,  Metubarris, %0a%3c the  biggest  of  all  the  River  Islands.  Besides,  remarkable %0a%3c Rivers  :  Calapis,  running  into  Saus,  near  Siscia  ;  where, %0a%3c with  a  double  Channel,  it  maketh  the  Island  called  Segestica. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BOOK  III.]  History  of  Nature.  197 %0a%3c %0a%3c Another  River,  Bacuntius,  running  likewise  into  Saus  at %0a%3c the  Town  Sirmium :  where  is  the  City  of  the  Sirmians  and %0a%3c Amantines.  Forty-five  Miles  from  thence,  Taurunum,  where %0a%3c Saus  is  intermingled  with  Danubius.  Higher  above  there  run %0a%3c into  it  Valdanus  and  Urpanus,  which  are  no  obscure  Rivers. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  XXVI. %0a%3c Mcesia. %0a%3c %0a%3c To  Pannonia  is  joined  the  Province  called  Mcesia,  which %0a%3c extendeth^'along  Danubiusl  unto  Pontus.  It  beginneth %0a%3c from  the  confluent  above  named.  In  it  are  the  Dardani, %0a%3c Celegeri,  Triballi,  Trimachi,  Mcesi,  Thraces,  and  the  Scy- %0a%3c thae,  bordering  upon  Pontus.  Fair  Rivers,  out  of  the %0a%3c Dardanian  Borders :  Margis,  Pingus,  and  Timachis.  Out %0a%3c of  Rhodop£,  Oessus :  out  of  Haemus,  Utus,  Essamus,  and %0a%3c Jeterus.  Illyricum,  where  it  is  broadest,  taketh  up  325 %0a%3c Miles  :  in  Length  from  the  River  Arsia  to  the  River  Drinius, %0a%3c 800  Miles.  From  Drinium  to  the  Promontory  Acroce- %0a%3c raunium,  182  Miles.  M.  Agrippa  hath  set  down  this  whole %0a%3c Gulf,  comprehending  Italy  and  Illyricum,  in  the  compass  of %0a%3c 1300  Miles.  In  it  are  two  Seas,  bounded  as  I  have  said: %0a%3c that  is,  the  Lower,  otherwise  called  the  Ionian,  in  the  first %0a%3c Part :  the  Inner,  called  Adriaticum,  which  also  they  name %0a%3c the  Upper.  In  the  Ausonian  Sea  there  are  no  Islands  worth %0a%3c the  naming,  but  those  above  specified.  In  the  Ionian  Sea %0a%3c there  are  but  few :  upon  the  Calabrian  Coast,  before  Brun- %0a%3c dusium,  by  the  interposition  of  which  the  Harbour  is  made : %0a%3c and  against  the  Apulian  Coast,  Diomedea,  famous  for  the %0a%3c Tomb  of  Diomedes.  Another  of  the  same  Name,  called  by %0a%3c some  Teutria.  The  Coast  of  Illyricum  is  heaped  with  more %0a%3c than  1000  ;  such  is  the  nature  of  the  Sea,  full  of  Shallows, %0a%3c with  narrow  Channels  running^ between.  But  before  the %0a%3c Mouth  of  Timavus,  there  are  Islands  famous  for  hot  Waters, %0a%3c which  flow  with  the  Sea.  And  near  the  Territory  of  the %0a%3c Istri,  Cissa,  Pullariaj,  and  those  which  the'Greeks  name  Ab- %0a%3c syrtides,  from  Absyrtis,  Brother  of  Medea,  there  slain.

[BooK  III. %0a%3c %0a%3c them  they  called  the  Islands  Electridse,  wherein  is  produced %0a%3c Amber,  which  they  call  Electrum  :  a  very  certain  Argument %0a%3c to  prove  the  Vanity  of  the  Greeks ;  inasmuch  as  the  matters %0a%3c they  assigned  to  him  were  never  known.  Opposite  lader  is %0a%3c Lissa ;  and  certain  others  over  against  the  Liburni,  called %0a%3c Creteae  :  and  as  many  of  the  Liburni,  Celadusse.  Opposite %0a%3c Surium  is  Brattia,  commended  for  Oxen  and  Goats.  Issa, %0a%3c inhabited  by  Roman  Citizens,  and  Pharia  with  the  Town. %0a%3c Next  to  these,  Corcyra,  surnamed  Melsena ;  with  the  Town %0a%3c of  the  Guidii,  distant  22  Miles  :  between  which  and  Illy- %0a%3c ricum  is  Melita  ;  from  whence  (as  Callimachus)  testifieth) %0a%3c the  little  Dogs  Melitaei  took  their  Name1 ;  and  twelve  Miles %0a%3c from  thence,  the  three  Elaphites.  In  the  Ionian  Sea,  from %0a%3c Oricum  1000  Miles,  is  Sasonis,  well  known  for  the  Station  of %0a%3c Pirates. %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  There  were  two  islands  called  Melita :  one  of  them  between  Sicily %0a%3c and  Africa,  famous  for  the  shipwreck  of  St.  Paul ;  and  from  which,  Strabo %0a%3c says,  the  Melitean  or  Maltese  dogs  took  their  name.  The  other  Melita %0a%3c was  on  the  coast  of  Illyria ;  and  from  this,  other  authors  besides  Pliny %0a%3c suppose  these  favourite  animals  to  have  been  derived.—  Wern.  Club. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Note. — The  reader  will  have  observed  in  the  preceding  chapters  a %0a%3c strange  diversity  of  opinion  in  the  mind  of  the  author :  for  whilst  he %0a%3c ascribes  every  ominous  appearance  to  the  deities  presiding  over  the  affairs %0a%3c of  men,  yet,  in  other  passages,  he  expresses  his  doubts  as  to  their  ex- %0a%3c istence, or  would  limit  to  the  earth  itself  the  controlling  power ;  in  other %0a%3c words,  he  believed  the  earth  to  be  a  deity.  From  these  incongruities  we %0a%3c can  derive  but  one  opinion,  namely,  that,  heathen  as  he  was,  Pliny  never- %0a%3c theless doubted  the  truth  of  that  which  his  countrymen  and  other  heathen %0a%3c nations  believed,  whilst  he  fell  short  of  that  true  knowledge  which,  in %0a%3c and  before  his  day,  had  been  vouchsafed  to  many  like  himself,  who  from %0a%3c heathenism  were  converted  to  Christianity,  either  through  the  evidence %0a%3c of  miracles,  by  which  its  truth  was  supported,  or  through  the  opening  of %0a%3c the  eyes  of  the  understanding,  by  which  means  they  acknowledged  that %0a%3c which  seemed  a  mystery  before.  Considering  these  chapters  in  this  light, %0a%3c much  interest  is  added  to  the  style  and  spirit  in  which  our  author  wrote. %0a%3c — Wern.
