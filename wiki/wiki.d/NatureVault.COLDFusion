Mayer%0a%0aI have two words that I think will rock your world:%0aOxygen Vacancy%0a%0aI don't really want to get into my theory of Ceramic Oxide Lattice Defect (COLD) fusion right now but I will talk about how Tresino's have rocked my world and given a mechanism to what I am seeing in the geology of noble metal formation in the earth.%0a%0aYou may not be very familiar with oxygen vacancies as a physicist, but basically any metal or metalloid lattice compound (usually with oxygen - but also hydrides, chlorides, etc) can have defects like oxygen vacancies. These defects give the material strange properties. Oxygen vacancies have a +2 charge since it has a lack of a -2 oxidation state oxygen. A strange property of these oxygen vacancies is they are relatively easy to neutralize them with a relatively small voltage, on the order of tens or hundreds of volts. This produces what is called a "neutral oxygen vacancy" and it just so happens to have 2 electrons filling the vacancy. Before stumbling on your work, I didn't think 2 electrons was enough to do anything, and figured I would have to produce a muon to fill an OV in order to create fusion. But seeing that a tresino just requires two spin coupled electrons, I think we have that in neutral oxygen vacancies. This can also explain the LENR experiments because they are using hydrides, and using voltages and conditions that could both produce and neutralize hydrogen vacancies in the palladium hydride lattice.%0a%0aHere is the big kicker. It can also explain how there is excess heat in the earth. Much of the mantle is in the form of 'silicate perovskite'. this lattice structure is very prone to oxygen vacancies and is the form of super capacitor materials like Barium Titanate and other titanates. At the elevated temperatures and pressures oxygen vacancies would be created and likely neutralized. Water would be split and hydrogens would be able to occupy the vacancies and fuse according to your tresino theory.%0a%0aHopefully that helps bring theoretical closure to your theory of excess heat in the earth. I just have one question for my own theory of noble metal creation, do you think tresinos may help heavier elements such as iron's fuse as well? I appreciate any response.%0a%0aThank you for your work on Tresino's, it has really helped in bringing me closer to theoretical closure for my theory of noble metal creation as well.%0a%0aRingwoodite in the mantle contains water https://www.bnl.gov/newsroom/news.php?a=111648%0a%0aSilicate perovskite is decomposition of ringwoodite https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicate_perovskite#Stability_range
