text=The Second Commandment %0a%0a%0a%0a198. The second Mit^va (commandment) is inseparably connected with the %0aTAitzva of fear, and it is the M.itzva of love— for man to love his Creator with %0aperfect love. What is perfect love? It is a great love, as it is written, "He walks %0abefore the Creator in complete sincerity and perfection" (Beresheet, 17:1), %0awhich signifies perfection in love. Thus, it is written, "And the Creator said, %0a'Let there be Light'" (Beresheet, 1:3)— this is perfect love, called "great love." %0aThis is precisely how man should love his Creator. %0a%0aThere exists conditional love, which appears as a result of all the goodness %0areceived from the Creator ("Introduction to The Study of Ten Sefirot," items %0a66-74), as a result of which man merges with the Creator with all his heart and %0asoul. Yet, although he merges with the Creator in complete perfection, this %0alove is considered imperfect. It is similar to Noah's love (Beresheet Raba, 30), %0awho constantly needed to reinforce his feeling— to see that the Creator sends %0ahim only goodness. %0a%0aAvraham, however, needed nothing to reinforce his love for the Creator, %0aas it is written: "He walks before the Creator in complete perfection." For the %0awords "walks before" mean that he needs nothing to reinforce his feeling of love %0afor the Creator. And even if he does not receive anything from Him, his love %0aremains constant and perfect, and he wishes to merge with the Creator with his %0aheart and soul. %0a%0a199. Rabbi Elazar said, "I have heard what perfect love means." He was told, %0a"Tell this to Rabbi Pinchas, as he truly exists on that degree." Rabbi Elazar %0asaid, "Perfect love means that it is perfect on both sides; if it does not include %0aboth sides, such a love is imperfect." %0a%0aHe was told to turn to Rabbi Pinchas, for Rabbi Pinchas had already %0aattained the degree of perfect love and will be able understand him correctly. %0a%0a385 %0a%0a%0a%0a386 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aThe words "on both sides" refer to both the good side and the evil side. In other %0awords, if the Creator gives him not only goodness, but restrictions, too (which %0ahe perceives as unpleasant), and even if He takes his soul away, still man's love %0afor the Creator remains perfect, as though he receives from Him nothing but %0athe very best in the world. %0a%0a200. Therefore, there is he who loves the Creator in order to gain riches, %0alive a long life, have many healthy children, and rule over his enemies— he %0areceives everything he wants, and this is why he loves the Creator. However, %0ashould he receive the opposite, should the Creator lead him through a wheel %0aof suffering, he will come to hate the Creator, and will feel no love toward %0aHim whatsoever. Therefore, such a love is baseless. %0a%0aSince his love depends on what he receives from the Creator, when %0areception stops, so does his love. Clearly, man can love only one or the other— %0ahimself or the Creator! %0a%0a201. Love is considered perfect if it exists on both sides— on the side of judgment %0aand the side of mercy (success in life). As we already mentioned, when one %0aloves the Creator, even if He were to take away his soul, this love would remain %0aperfect on both sides: mercy and judgment. Therefore, the Light of the %0aFirst Act of Creation was revealed and then concealed. And because of this %0aconcealment, strict judgment appeared in the world, and both sides, mercy %0aand judgment, united to form perfection. And this is the desired love. %0a%0aThe Light that was created on the first day of creation (in the verse "Let there %0abe Light") was later concealed, as it is written, for the righteous in the world to %0acome. It was concealed so as to let strict judgment appear in this world. %0a%0aThis leads to the unification of the two sides (mercy and judgment) into one, %0afor man receives an opportunity to reveal the perfection of love even when the %0aCreator takes his soul away, and he is given an opportunity to supplement and %0aperfect his love. And had the Light not been concealed, strict judgment would %0anot have been revealed, and the GREAT LOVE would have been concealed %0afrom the righteous, and there would be no way of revealing it. %0a%0a202. Rabbi Shimon kissed him. Rabbi Pinchas approached, kissed and blessed %0ahim. He said, "It is clear that the Creator has sent me here. This is the tiny %0aray of Light that was said to be shining in my house, and would later light up %0athe whole world" (item 186). Rabbi Elazar said that fear must certainly not be %0aforgotten from all the Mitzvot; especially in this Mitzva, the Mitzva of love, %0afear must be attached to this Mitzva at all times. How is it attached? Love is %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Second Commandment %0a%0a%0a%0a387 %0a%0a%0a%0agood when it brings goodness, health, sustenance, and life from the Beloved %0aOne. And it is here that fear of sinning must be revived, so that the wheel does %0anot turn against him, as it is written, "Happy is the man who always fears," %0afor his fear is contained in his love. %0a%0a203. This is how fear should be evoked from the perspective of strict judgment, %0afor once man realizes that strict judgment hovers over him, he must evoke %0awithin him fear of his Master. Thus, his heart will not be hardened, of which %0ait is written, "He that hardens his heart shall fall into evil," into the other %0aside. This is called evil. Therefore, fear unites with both sides— with goodness %0aand love, as well as with strict judgment, and consists of both. And if fear is %0aunited with the good side and love, as well as with the strictness of judgment, %0asuch a love is perfect. %0a%0aThe Mitzva of fear includes all the Mitzvot of the Torah; it is the gateway to %0afaith in the Creator— to the extent of his fear, man acquires faith in the Creator's %0agovernance. Hence, he must not forget fear in observing every Mitzva, especially %0athe Mitzva of love, at which time fear needs to be roused even more, for fear %0amust constantly be present in the Mitzva of love. Therefore, man must evoke %0afear within him in the two states of love: in love from the good side, when he %0areceives good sensations from the Creator, and in love from the evil side, when %0athe Creator sends him harsh restrictions, according to judgment. %0a%0aHowever, it would be incorrect to think that perfect love means a state %0awhere one receives bad feelings from the Creator, to the extent of feeling one's %0asoul being taken away. It is incorrect to think that one should not fear the %0aCreator's judgment and strictness, and, despite his feelings to cling unto Him %0awith love, fearlessly and wholeheartedly. %0a%0aFirst, one must rouse fear within him lest his love for the Creator will %0aweaken. Thus, he combines love and fear. Second, from the other side of love, %0afrom the side of feeling the strictness, he must rouse within him fear before %0athe Creator, and not let his heart harden, so it would not stop heeding the %0aunpleasant sensations of punishment. Thus, here, too, he includes fear and %0alove, and if he acts so in both sides of love, his love remains forever connected %0ato fear, thus becoming perfect. %0a%0aIt is written about the good side's inclusion of fear into love: "Happy is %0athe man who always fears." The word "always" indicates that although man %0aalways receives only goodness from the Creator, he fears Him nonetheless, for %0ahe fears that he may sin. %0a%0a%0a%0a388 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aAnd it is written about the evil side's inclusion of fear into love, when man %0afeels punishments and strictness of judgment: "He who lets his heart be hardened %0ashall fall into awe." This means that one should in no way and under no circum- %0astances let his heart be hardened under the judgment's influence. Otherwise, he %0awill fall into the impure forces, called "evil." In such a case, he must rouse within %0ahim even more fear of the Creator, and mingle his fear into the love. %0a%0aHowever, neither kind is fear for oneself, for one's own well-being. Rather, %0athey both refer to man's fear of diminishing his intentions and actions for the %0aCreator's sake, and his attempts to direct them all towards pleasing Him. %0a%0aThus, we have clarified the first two Mitzvot of the Torah— the Mitzvot of fear %0aand love. The Mitzva of fear is the basis for all the other Mitzvot and of the entire %0aTorah. It is contained in the first word of the Torah, BERESHEET (IN THE %0aBEGINNING), and in its first sentence, IN THE BEGINNING THE CREATOR %0aCREATED THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH. Fear is called BEGINNING, %0afrom which THE HEAVENS and THE EARTH are born, meaning ZON and %0atheir descendants, the worlds of BYA. And the second sentence in the Torah %0arefers to punishment in the form of four kinds of spiritual death: WITHOUT %0aFORM means strangulation, CHAOTIC means stoning, DARKNESS means %0aburning, and SPIRIT means beheading. The Mitzva of love is described in the %0aTorah in the verse: AND THE CREATOR SAID, 'LET THERE BE LIGHT' %0a%0aThere are two sides to this Mitzva, which are called "kindness and longevity" %0aand "with all one's soul." This implies that man should feel love even under the %0aworst kinds of circumstances, i.e., when the Creator takes his soul away, just as %0ahe feels it when everything is well. %0a%0aJust to reveal this perfect love, the Light of creation was concealed. Fear must %0aalso be included in both sides of love: in the part where man must fear to commit %0aa sin, thereby reducing his love for the Creator, and in the part where he must fear %0abecause of the concealment and the Creator's judgment. Yet, to understand these %0aspiritual categories, we must clarify them in a slightly different manner. %0a%0aCalls for love are used repeatedly in the Torah: "Love thy neighbor...," "Do %0anot do what you hate to another," and so on. But the basis of all this is love %0abetween man and the Creator; this is where our requests are directed: "Draw us %0anearer with love...," "He who chooses Israel with love..." %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Second Commandment %0a%0a%0a%0a389 %0a%0a%0a%0aWe can take as an example the natural love between father and son. Parents %0anaturally love their only son more than anything in the world. Accordingly, the %0ason should hold the same kind of love for his parents. Yet, we see that this is not %0aso: if the son feels unconditional love from his parents, then, in accordance with %0anature's law and regardless of himself, his love for them will decrease. %0a%0aThis is so because the father's love for his son is natural; and just as the %0afather wants his son to love him, his son wants to be loved by his father. This %0areciprocal desire gives rise to fear in both their hearts: the father is afraid that %0athe son may hate him (even a little), and the son fears the same. %0a%0aThis constant fear begets good deeds between them: each of them aspires %0ato show his love to the other, so as to promote reciprocity. Yet, when their love %0areaches peaks, and there is nothing else that can be added to it, the beloved son %0adiscovers absolute and unconditional love in the heart of his loving father. %0a%0aThe loved one immediately stops fearing that he will be loved less; neither %0acan he hope that the love for him will grow. And this leads to a situation where %0athe son grows lazy and stops expressing his love with good deeds. And as they %0alessen, his love lessens, too, until it is reversed into its opposite— hatred, for he %0adeems everything his father does as worthless and insufficient in comparison %0awith what the father's actions out of "absolute" love should be. Therefore, the %0aunion of love and fear within man brings him to the state of perfection. %0a%0aThe four letters HaVaYaH (Yod + Hey + Vav + Hey) correspond to Sefirot %0aH-B-ZA-M. The Zohar calls them, FEAR, LOVE, TORAH, COMMAND- %0aMENT, respectively. %0a%0a%0a%0aYOD - %0a%0a%0a- HOCHMA - %0a%0a%0aFEAR %0a%0a%0aHEY - %0a%0a%0a- BINA %0a%0a%0aLOVE %0a%0a%0aVAV - %0a%0a%0a- ZA %0a%0a%0aTORAH %0a%0a%0aHEY - %0a%0a%0a- MALCHUT - %0a%0a%0aCOMMANDMENT %0a%0a%0a%0aPartzuf AA is the main Partzuf, and includes the entire world of Atzilut It %0ashines upon all the other worlds through its garments, called AVI, YESHSL7T and %0aZON, where AVI and YESHSUT clothe AA from its Peh to Tabur, while ZON %0aclothe AA from Tabur down to its Slum Raglairn (end of legs) that stand on Parsa. %0a%0aAA is called "the concealed Hochma," as its Ohr Hochma is concealed in %0aits Rosh and does not shine upon the other Partzufim and worlds, and only its %0aBina shines below. Thus, it is Bina (and not AA) that is called BERESHEET— %0aBEGINNING, for she is the foundation and the source of all the worlds. %0a%0a%0a%0a390 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aAnd she is also called FEAR OF THE CREATOR, i.e., fear of His greatness, %0a"for He is the only Master and the root of all, and all that exists is as nothing %0acompared to Him." And ZON (called HEAVEN AND EARTH) emerge from %0aBina. It is therefore written in the Torah, IN THE BEGINNING (with fear) AVI, %0aTHE CREATOR CREATED HEAVEN (ZA) AND EARTH (Malchut). %0a%0aHence, it is said: "Fear of the Creator is the beginning of wisdom (Hochma)" %0aand "Fear of the Creator is the beginning of knowledge (Daat)." Ohr Hochma %0astems not from the Sefira Hochma de AA, but from Bina de AA alone. For when %0aBina de AA ascends to Rosh de AA, it turns to the Sefira Hochma and then passes the %0aLight downward. It follows that the Sefira Bina, fear of the Creator, is the source of %0aOhr Hochma; hence, it is said, "Fear of the Creator is the beginning of Hochma." %0a%0aAlso, fear is the beginning of knowledge, for the Sefira Daat is the beginning %0aof ZON: ZON raise their request to Rosh de AA in order to receive Hochma. %0aAnd this request of ZON regarding reception of Ohr Hochma, which is received %0aand felt by AA, is called Daat, knowledge. This is why it is written: "Fear of the %0aCreator is the beginning of knowledge (Daat)." %0a%0aThe Zohar also tells us that afterwards fear and love unite so as never to part %0aagain, for Hochma is called "love." Indeed, the letter Yod of the name HaVaYaH %0ais Bina, i.e., GAR de Bina (AVI) that wants only Ohr Hassadim, whereas Ohr %0aHochma is concealed within it. %0a%0aAnd the place of revelation of Ohr Hochma is ZAT de Bina, called YESHSL7T, %0athe first letter Hey of the name HaVaYaH. Therefore, this place is called love, %0aand it is the second Mitzva that follows the first Mitzva of fear, which shines in %0aZON, for this Ohr Hochma does not stem from Hochma de AVI, but from Bina, %0aand Bina is known as fear. %0a%0aAnd The Zohar says that fear unites with love so as to never let it go. This %0ameans that Bina forever unites with Hochma and does not part with it. And %0awherever there is Bina, Hochma is there alongside her. And although it seems to %0awrite that one Mitzva is fear and another is love (that these are separate Mitzvot), %0athey are nonetheless always together and are never apart: just as the first Mitzva %0aincludes the first, so the first includes the second. %0a%0aThe reason they have separate names is that we distinguish them by their %0adominance: in the first Mitzva, it is AVI, GAR de Bina, Bina herself along with her %0aproperty. Hence, it is called "fear." However, in the second Mitzva it is Hochma %0athat is dominant; hence, it is called "love." %0a%0aTherefore, the words of the Torah, IN THE BEGINNING THE CREATOR %0aCREATED constitute concealment, and the revelation of these words begins %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Second Commandment %0a%0a%0a%0a391 %0a%0a%0a%0awith the words LET THERE BE LIGHT, designating the ascent of Bina %0a(BEGINNING) to Rosh de AA, where Bina becomes like Hochma. %0a%0aThe combination of Hochma and Bina is then called GREAT LOVE. This %0ais the meaning of the words, LET THERE BE LIGHT, for Bina ascends to AA %0aand passes the Light to all the lower worlds with GREAT LOVE, i.e., by means %0aof two Lights: Hassadim and Hochma. %0a%0aThis is why it is said that the CREATOR'S LOVE IS CLARIFIED FROM %0aTWO SIDES, as it is written: LET THERE BE LIGHT IN THIS WORLD AND %0aIN THE WORLD TO COME. Because the Creator saw that this world cannot %0areceive the Light, He concealed His Light and raised it above Parsa de AA, called %0a(according to its corrected properties) "the world to come," above Chazeh de AA, %0awhere AVI or GAR de Bina reside. %0a%0aParsa is located below Chazeh de AA, and it separates the Supernal Waters %0a(AVI) from the lower waters (YESHSL7T + ZON). Since Ohr Hochma does not %0ashine below Chazeh de AA, it is said that the Light is concealed from Partzufim %0aYESHSUTand ZON. %0a%0aThus, we see that Bina is divided into two parts: GAR de Bina (AVI), located %0aabove the Chazeh (Parsa de AA or the Supernal Waters), upon whom the Upper %0aLight shines, meaning that secrets are revealed within them. He who ascends to %0athis degree receives its Light, thereby meriting "wealth (Hochma) and longevity %0a(Hassadim). His sons (his future corrections) are like olive sprouts (olive oil %0asymbolizes Hochma), they gather round his table (Hassadim), and he rules over %0ahis enemies (impure forces), and whatever his wish may be, he succeeds in it %0a(for Ohr Hochma is clothed in Ohr Hassadim)." ZAT de Bina are the lower waters, %0alocated below Chazeh de AA. The Light is concealed from them, and those who %0areceive from them must love the Creator with the kind of love called "even if He %0atakes away his soul." %0a%0aThese are the two degrees of love for the Creator. That is to say, love for %0athe Creator is not the desire and decision of man alone. Rather, like any of our %0aother desires, it appears only by attaining a particular degree: if one attains the %0adegree of YESHSUT, it allows him to love the Creator "even if He takes away %0ahis soul." However, an even more perfect love emerges within him who reaches %0athe degree of AVI: he receives such Light from it that his love for the Creator %0abecomes perfect on both sides. %0a%0aYet, fear must be included in both kinds of love. For at the degree of AVI, %0aone needs fear so as to not sin while in a state of spiritual ascent in AVI. And %0awhile at the degree of YESHSUT, one must fear lest his heart be hardened, %0a%0a%0a%0a392 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0afor Hochma and Bina correspond to love and fear in a state of eternal unity. %0aTherefore, one must include the properties of Bina (fear) into GAR de Bina %0a(AVI), as well as into ZAT de Bina (YESHSUT). %0a%0aOnly then will love be perfect on both sides, in both forms: GAR and ZAT %0ade Bina. Love cannot possibly be perfect only on one side, but only if fear exists %0aon both sides, for Hochma (love) cannot exist without Bina (fear). %0a%0aIt follows that conditional love is the degree of AVI, whereas unconditional %0a(perfect) love is the degree of YESHSLT. Yet, YESHSLT is below AVI. The thing %0ais that man first receives Higher Sefirot of his emerging Partzuf, in the order %0aKHB-ZA-M, but the Light enters them in the reverse order of NRNHY: first, he %0areceives the Sefira Keter with the Light of Ne/esh, and in the end he receives the %0aSefira Malchut, though the Light of Yechida enters Keter. Therefore, if we measure %0aaccording to the Sefirot (Kelim), the degree of AVI = GE = K-H (conditional love) %0ais smaller than the degree of YESHSLT = AHP = B-ZA-M (unconditional love).

The second Mit^va (commandment) is inseparably connected with the %0a%3c TAitzva of fear, and it is the M.itzva of love— for man to love his Creator with %0a%3c perfect love. What is perfect love? It is a great love, as it is written, "He walks %0a%3c before the Creator in complete sincerity and perfection" (Beresheet, 17:1), %0a%3c which signifies perfection in love. Thus, it is written, "And the Creator said, %0a%3c 'Let there be Light'" (Beresheet, 1:3)— this is perfect love, called "great love." %0a%3c This is precisely how man should love his Creator. %0a%3c %0a%3c There exists conditional love, which appears as a result of all the goodness %0a%3c received from the Creator ("Introduction to The Study of Ten Sefirot," items %0a%3c 66-74), as a result of which man merges with the Creator with all his heart and %0a%3c soul.

Therefore, man must evoke %0a%3c fear within him in the two states of love: in love from the good side, when he %0a%3c receives good sensations from the Creator, and in love from the evil side, when %0a%3c the Creator sends him harsh restrictions, according to judgment. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, it would be incorrect to think that perfect love means a state %0a%3c where one receives bad feelings from the Creator, to the extent of feeling one's %0a%3c soul being taken away. It is incorrect to think that one should not fear the %0a%3c Creator's judgment and strictness, and, despite his feelings to cling unto Him %0a%3c with love, fearlessly and wholeheartedly. %0a%3c %0a%3c First, one must rouse fear within him lest his love for the Creator will %0a%3c weaken. Thus, he combines love and fear. Second, from the other side of love, %0a%3c from the side of feeling the strictness, he must rouse within him fear before %0a%3c the Creator, and not let his heart harden, so it would not stop heeding the %0a%3c unpleasant sensations of punishment. Thus, here, too, he includes fear and %0a%3c love, and if he acts so in both sides of love, his love remains forever connected %0a%3c to fear, thus becoming perfect. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is written about the good side's inclusion of fear into love: "Happy is %0a%3c the man who always fears." The word "always" indicates that although man %0a%3c always receives only goodness from the Creator, he fears Him nonetheless, for %0a%3c he fears that he may sin. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 388 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c And it is written about the evil side's inclusion of fear into love, when man %0a%3c feels punishments and strictness of judgment: "He who lets his heart be hardened %0a%3c shall fall into awe." This means that one should in no way and under no circum- %0a%3c stances let his heart be hardened under the judgment's influence. Otherwise, he %0a%3c will fall into the impure forces, called "evil." In such a case, he must rouse within %0a%3c him even more fear of the Creator, and mingle his fear into the love. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, neither kind is fear for oneself, for one's own well-being. Rather, %0a%3c they both refer to man's fear of diminishing his intentions and actions for the %0a%3c Creator's sake, and his attempts to direct them all towards pleasing Him. %0a%3c %0a%3c Thus, we have clarified the first two Mitzvot of the Torah— the Mitzvot of fear %0a%3c and love. The Mitzva of fear is the basis for all the other Mitzvot and of the entire %0a%3c Torah. It is contained in the first word of the Torah, BERESHEET (IN THE %0a%3c BEGINNING), and in its first sentence, IN THE BEGINNING THE CREATOR %0a%3c CREATED THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH. Fear is called BEGINNING, %0a%3c from which THE HEAVENS and THE EARTH are born, meaning ZON and %0a%3c their descendants, the worlds of BYA. And the second sentence in the Torah %0a%3c refers to punishment in the form of four kinds of spiritual death: WITHOUT %0a%3c FORM means strangulation, CHAOTIC means stoning, DARKNESS means %0a%3c burning, and SPIRIT means beheading. The Mitzva of love is described in the %0a%3c Torah in the verse: AND THE CREATOR SAID, 'LET THERE BE LIGHT' %0a%3c %0a%3c There are two sides to this Mitzva, which are called "kindness and longevity" %0a%3c and "with all one's soul." This implies that man should feel love even under the %0a%3c worst kinds of circumstances, i.e., when the Creator takes his soul away, just as %0a%3c he feels it when everything is well. %0a%3c %0a%3c Just to reveal this perfect love, the Light of creation was concealed. Fear must %0a%3c also be included in both sides of love: in the part where man must fear to commit %0a%3c a sin, thereby reducing his love for the Creator, and in the part where he must fear %0a%3c because of the concealment and the Creator's judgment. Yet, to understand these %0a%3c spiritual categories, we must clarify them in a slightly different manner. %0a%3c %0a%3c Calls for love are used repeatedly in the Torah: "Love thy neighbor...," "Do %0a%3c not do what you hate to another," and so on. But the basis of all this is love %0a%3c between man and the Creator; this is where our requests are directed: "Draw us %0a%3c nearer with love...," "He who chooses Israel with love..." %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Second Commandment %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 389 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c We can take as an example the natural love between father and son. Parents %0a%3c naturally love their only son more than anything in the world. Accordingly, the %0a%3c son should hold the same kind of love for his parents. Yet, we see that this is not %0a%3c so: if the son feels unconditional love from his parents, then, in accordance with %0a%3c nature's law and regardless of himself, his love for them will decrease. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is so because the father's love for his son is natural; and just as the %0a%3c father wants his son to love him, his son wants to be loved by his father. This %0a%3c reciprocal desire gives rise to fear in both their hearts: the father is afraid that %0a%3c the son may hate him (even a little), and the son fears the same. %0a%3c %0a%3c This constant fear begets good deeds between them: each of them aspires %0a%3c to show his love to the other, so as to promote reciprocity. Yet, when their love %0a%3c reaches peaks, and there is nothing else that can be added to it, the beloved son %0a%3c discovers absolute and unconditional love in the heart of his loving father. %0a%3c %0a%3c The loved one immediately stops fearing that he will be loved less; neither %0a%3c can he hope that the love for him will grow. And this leads to a situation where %0a%3c the son grows lazy and stops expressing his love with good deeds. And as they %0a%3c lessen, his love lessens, too, until it is reversed into its opposite— hatred, for he %0a%3c deems everything his father does as worthless and insufficient in comparison %0a%3c with what the father's actions out of "absolute" love should be. Therefore, the %0a%3c union of love and fear within man brings him to the state of perfection. %0a%3c %0a%3c The four letters HaVaYaH (Yod + Hey + Vav + Hey) correspond to Sefirot %0a%3c H-B-ZA-M. The Zohar calls them, FEAR, LOVE, TORAH, COMMAND- %0a%3c MENT, respectively. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c YOD - %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c - HOCHMA - %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c FEAR %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c HEY - %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c - BINA %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c LOVE %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c VAV - %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c - ZA %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c TORAH %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c HEY - %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c - MALCHUT - %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c COMMANDMENT %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Partzuf AA is the main Partzuf, and includes the entire world of Atzilut It %0a%3c shines upon all the other worlds through its garments, called AVI, YESHSL7T and %0a%3c ZON, where AVI and YESHSUT clothe AA from its Peh to Tabur, while ZON %0a%3c clothe AA from Tabur down to its Slum Raglairn (end of legs) that stand on Parsa. %0a%3c %0a%3c AA is called "the concealed Hochma," as its Ohr Hochma is concealed in %0a%3c its Rosh and does not shine upon the other Partzufim and worlds, and only its %0a%3c Bina shines below. Thus, it is Bina (and not AA) that is called BERESHEET— %0a%3c BEGINNING, for she is the foundation and the source of all the worlds. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 390 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c And she is also called FEAR OF THE CREATOR, i.e., fear of His greatness, %0a%3c "for He is the only Master and the root of all, and all that exists is as nothing %0a%3c compared to Him." And ZON (called HEAVEN AND EARTH) emerge from %0a%3c Bina. It is therefore written in the Torah, IN THE BEGINNING (with fear) AVI, %0a%3c THE CREATOR CREATED HEAVEN (ZA) AND EARTH (Malchut). %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, it is said: "Fear of the Creator is the beginning of wisdom (Hochma)" %0a%3c and "Fear of the Creator is the beginning of knowledge (Daat)." Ohr Hochma %0a%3c stems not from the Sefira Hochma de AA, but from Bina de AA alone. For when %0a%3c Bina de AA ascends to Rosh de AA, it turns to the Sefira Hochma and then passes the %0a%3c Light downward. It follows that the Sefira Bina, fear of the Creator, is the source of %0a%3c Ohr Hochma; hence, it is said, "Fear of the Creator is the beginning of Hochma." %0a%3c %0a%3c Also, fear is the beginning of knowledge, for the Sefira Daat is the beginning %0a%3c of ZON: ZON raise their request to Rosh de AA in order to receive Hochma. %0a%3c And this request of ZON regarding reception of Ohr Hochma, which is received %0a%3c and felt by AA, is called Daat, knowledge. This is why it is written: "Fear of the %0a%3c Creator is the beginning of knowledge (Daat)." %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar also tells us that afterwards fear and love unite so as never to part %0a%3c again, for Hochma is called "love." Indeed, the letter Yod of the name HaVaYaH %0a%3c is Bina, i.e., GAR de Bina (AVI) that wants only Ohr Hassadim, whereas Ohr %0a%3c Hochma is concealed within it. %0a%3c %0a%3c And the place of revelation of Ohr Hochma is ZAT de Bina, called YESHSL7T, %0a%3c the first letter Hey of the name HaVaYaH. Therefore, this place is called love, %0a%3c and it is the second Mitzva that follows the first Mitzva of fear, which shines in %0a%3c ZON, for this Ohr Hochma does not stem from Hochma de AVI, but from Bina, %0a%3c and Bina is known as fear. %0a%3c %0a%3c And The Zohar says that fear unites with love so as to never let it go. This %0a%3c means that Bina forever unites with Hochma and does not part with it. And %0a%3c wherever there is Bina, Hochma is there alongside her. And although it seems to %0a%3c write that one Mitzva is fear and another is love (that these are separate Mitzvot), %0a%3c they are nonetheless always together and are never apart: just as the first Mitzva %0a%3c includes the first, so the first includes the second. %0a%3c %0a%3c The reason they have separate names is that we distinguish them by their %0a%3c dominance: in the first Mitzva, it is AVI, GAR de Bina, Bina herself along with her %0a%3c property. Hence, it is called "fear." However, in the second Mitzva it is Hochma %0a%3c that is dominant; hence, it is called "love." %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, the words of the Torah, IN THE BEGINNING THE CREATOR %0a%3c CREATED constitute concealment, and the revelation of these words begins %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Second Commandment %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 391 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c with the words LET THERE BE LIGHT, designating the ascent of Bina %0a%3c (BEGINNING) to Rosh de AA, where Bina becomes like Hochma. %0a%3c %0a%3c The combination of Hochma and Bina is then called GREAT LOVE. This %0a%3c is the meaning of the words, LET THERE BE LIGHT, for Bina ascends to AA %0a%3c and passes the Light to all the lower worlds with GREAT LOVE, i.e., by means %0a%3c of two Lights: Hassadim and Hochma. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is why it is said that the CREATOR'S LOVE IS CLARIFIED FROM %0a%3c TWO SIDES, as it is written: LET THERE BE LIGHT IN THIS WORLD AND %0a%3c IN THE WORLD TO COME. Because the Creator saw that this world cannot %0a%3c receive the Light, He concealed His Light and raised it above Parsa de AA, called %0a%3c (according to its corrected properties) "the world to come," above Chazeh de AA, %0a%3c where AVI or GAR de Bina reside. %0a%3c %0a%3c Parsa is located below Chazeh de AA, and it separates the Supernal Waters %0a%3c (AVI) from the lower waters (YESHSL7T + ZON). Since Ohr Hochma does not %0a%3c shine below Chazeh de AA, it is said that the Light is concealed from Partzufim %0a%3c YESHSUTand ZON. %0a%3c %0a%3c Thus, we see that Bina is divided into two parts: GAR de Bina (AVI), located %0a%3c above the Chazeh (Parsa de AA or the Supernal Waters), upon whom the Upper %0a%3c Light shines, meaning that secrets are revealed within them. He who ascends to %0a%3c this degree receives its Light, thereby meriting "wealth (Hochma) and longevity %0a%3c (Hassadim). His sons (his future corrections) are like olive sprouts (olive oil %0a%3c symbolizes Hochma), they gather round his table (Hassadim), and he rules over %0a%3c his enemies (impure forces), and whatever his wish may be, he succeeds in it %0a%3c (for Ohr Hochma is clothed in Ohr Hassadim)." ZAT de Bina are the lower waters, %0a%3c located below Chazeh de AA. The Light is concealed from them, and those who %0a%3c receive from them must love the Creator with the kind of love called "even if He %0a%3c takes away his soul." %0a%3c %0a%3c These are the two degrees of love for the Creator. That is to say, love for %0a%3c the Creator is not the desire and decision of man alone. Rather, like any of our %0a%3c other desires, it appears only by attaining a particular degree: if one attains the %0a%3c degree of YESHSUT, it allows him to love the Creator "even if He takes away %0a%3c his soul." However, an even more perfect love emerges within him who reaches %0a%3c the degree of AVI: he receives such Light from it that his love for the Creator %0a%3c becomes perfect on both sides. %0a%3c %0a%3c Yet, fear must be included in both kinds of love. For at the degree of AVI, %0a%3c one needs fear so as to not sin while in a state of spiritual ascent in AVI. And %0a%3c while at the degree of YESHSUT, one must fear lest his heart be hardened, %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 392 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c for Hochma and Bina correspond to love and fear in a state of eternal unity. %0a%3c Therefore, one must include the properties of Bina (fear) into GAR de Bina %0a%3c (AVI), as well as into ZAT de Bina (YESHSUT). %0a%3c %0a%3c Only then will love be perfect on both sides, in both forms: GAR and ZAT %0a%3c de Bina. Love cannot possibly be perfect only on one side, but only if fear exists %0a%3c on both sides, for Hochma (love) cannot exist without Bina (fear). %0a%3c %0a%3c It follows that conditional love is the degree of AVI, whereas unconditional %0a%3c (perfect) love is the degree of YESHSLT. Yet, YESHSLT is below AVI. The thing %0a%3c is that man first receives Higher Sefirot of his emerging Partzuf, in the order %0a%3c KHB-ZA-M, but the Light enters them in the reverse order of NRNHY: first, he %0a%3c receives the Sefira Keter with the Light of Ne/esh, and in the end he receives the %0a%3c Sefira Malchut, though the Light of Yechida enters Keter. Therefore, if we measure %0a%3c according to the Sefirot (Kelim), the degree of AVI = GE = K-H (conditional love) %0a%3c is smaller than the degree of YESHSLT = AHP = B-ZA-M (unconditional love). %0a\ No newline at end of file%0a
