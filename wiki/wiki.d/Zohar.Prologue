text=Prologue %0a%0a%0a%0aABOUT RABBI SHIMON BAR-YOCHAI 1 %0a%0aIn the second century CE, a single man %0awas granted the spiritual knowledge that %0aKabbalists had accumulated for 3,000 %0ayears before his time. Rabbi Shimon %0aBar-Yochai (Rashbi) put it all on paper %0aand then hid it, as humanity was not %0aready for it. Today, we are ready for the %0arevelation of The Book of Zohar. %0a%0aRabbi Shimon Bar-Yochai (Rashbi), %0aauthor of The Book of Zohar (The Book of %0aRadiance) was a Tana— a great sage in the early Common Era centuries. Rashbi's %0aname is tied to numerous legends, and he is mentioned constantly in the Talmud %0aand in the Midrash, the sacred Hebrew texts of his time. He lived in Sidon and %0ain Meron, and established a seminary in the Western Galilee. %0a%0aRashbi was born and raised in the Galilee (a mountainous region in %0atoday's Northern Israel). Even as a child, he was not like other children his age. %0aQuestions such as, "What is the purpose of my life?" "Who am I?" and "How is %0athe world built?" plagued him and demanded answers. %0a%0aIn those days, life in Galilee was very harsh: the Romans persecuted Jews %0aand continually invented new laws to make their lives more difficult. Among %0athese laws was a decree that prohibited Jews from studying the Torah (then %0asynonymous with Kabbalah). %0a%0a1 The articles, "About Rabbi Shimon Bar-^lbchai" and "About The Book of Zohar" are presented %0ahere courtesy of the paper Kabbalah Today. %0a%0a7 %0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0aA77A.1 %0a%0a%0a%0a711' 7^ |) W '21 • %0a%0a%0a%0a%0a( I %0a%0a%0a%0a%0a8 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aHowever, despite the Romans' prohibition, Rashbi immersed himself in the %0aKabbalah and tried to understand its subtle teachings. He felt that beneath the %0aBiblical stories was a profound and hidden truth, which held the answers to his %0apersistent questions. %0a%0aGradually, Rabbi Shimon came to realize that he had to find a teacher %0awho had already been through the spiritual path, gained experience, and could %0aguide others up the spiritual ladder. He decided to join the group of the greatest %0aKabbalist of the time— Rabbi Akiva— a decision that turned out to be the turning %0apoint in Rashbi's life. %0a%0aSTUDYING WITH RABBI AKIVA %0a%0aRabbi Shimon was an avid, devoted student, burning with desire to discover %0athe Higher realms of reality. Before long, he was one of Rabbi Akiva's prime %0astudents. He studied with Rabbi Akiva for thirteen years, and achieved the %0ahighest levels on the spiritual ladder. %0a%0aThe Bar-Kokheva revolt abruptly ended the great days of Rabbi Akiva's %0aseminary. Almost all of his 24,000 students died in plagues, and in fierce battles %0aagainst the Romans. Of the 24,000 students, only five survived, and Rashbi was %0aamong them. %0a%0aRashbi was among the leaders of the Bar-Kokheva revolt against the Roman %0arule in the land of Israel. His resistance became even more fierce and unyielding %0awhen he'd learned how his teacher, Rabbi Akiva, had been ruthlessly executed. %0a%0aThe Talmud writes that once, when Rashbi spoke against the Roman rule, %0aa fellow Jew heard him and alerted the Roman authorities. In consequence, %0aRashbi was tried in absentia and was sentenced to death. The Roman emperor %0asent men in search of him, but to their disappointment, Rashbi seemed to have %0avanished into thin air. %0a%0aTHE CAVE AT PECTIN %0a%0aLegends have it that Rashbi and his son fled to the Galilee, hid in a cave at %0aPeqi'in, a village in the north of Israel, and remained there for thirteen years. %0aDuring that time, they delved in the secrets of the wisdom of the hidden. Their %0aefforts succeeded, and they discovered the entire system of creation. %0a%0aAfter thirteen years in a cave, Rashbi heard that the Roman emperor had %0adied. He could finally heave a sigh of relief. After leaving the cave, Rashbi %0agathered nine students and went with them to a small cave in Meron, known as %0a%0a%0a%0aPrologue %0a%0a%0a%0a9 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Idra Raba (Great Assembly). With their help, he wrote The Book of Zohar, %0athe most important book of Kabbalah. %0a%0aBaal HaSulam described Rashbi and his students as the only beings who %0aachieved perfection, the 125 spiritual degrees that complete the correction %0aof one's soul. When he finished his commentary on The Book of Zohar, Baal %0aHaSulam held a festive meal to celebrate its completion. At that celebration, he %0astated that "...prior to the days of the Messiah, it is impossible to be awarded all %0a125 degrees... except the Rashbi and his contemporaries, meaning the authors %0aof The Book of Zohar. They were awarded all 125 degrees in completeness, even %0athough they lived prior to the days of the Messiah. Hence, we often find in %0aThe Zohar that there will not be a generation such as the Rashbi's until the %0ageneration of the Messiah King. This is why his composition made such a strong %0aimpression in the world, since the secrets of the Torah in it occupy the level of %0aall 125 degrees. This is also why it is said in The Zohar that The Book of Zohar will %0anot be revealed except at the end of days, meaning in the days of the Messiah." %0a%0aTHE IDRA RABA (GREAT ASSEMBLY) AND THE BOOK OF ZOHAR %0a%0aIdra Raba is a cave located in the north of Israel, between Meron and Zephath. %0aRashbi took his students to this cave, and there he wrote The Book of Zohar. It is %0aalmost impossible to understand how great Rabbi Shimon Bar-Yochai really was. %0aHe belongs, as Baal HaSulam puts it, to the highest Inner Light. This is why he %0ahad to use Rabbi Abba to put his words into writing. In The Book of Zohar, the %0aRashbi tells his students: "I am arranging you as follows: Rabbi Abba will write, %0aRabbi Elazar, my son, will study orally, and the rest of the friends will converse %0ain their hearts" (Zohar, Haazinu). %0a%0aThe Book of Zohar was written in the second century CE, not long after the %0aruin of the Second Temple and the beginning of the last exile of the people %0aof Israel from its land. But even prior to the exile, Rashbi predicted that The %0aBook of Zohar would only be revealed at the end of the exile. He stated that its %0aappearance to the masses would symbolize the end of the spiritual exile: "...in it, %0athey will come out of the exile with mercy" (Zohar, Naso). %0a%0aIt is also written in The Book of Zohar that its wisdom would be revealed %0ato all toward the end of the six thousand years, the period allotted to the %0acorrection of humanity: "And when it is near the days of the Messiah, even %0ainfants in the world are destined to find the secrets of the wisdom, and know %0ain them the ends and the calculations of redemption, and at that time it will %0abe revealed to all" (Zohar, VaYera). %0a%0a%0a%0a10 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aTHE REINCARNATION OF A UNIQUE SOUL %0a%0aRashbi is an incarnation of a unique soul, which coordinates and connects %0athe Upper Force to every creation. This soul comes down into our world and %0aincarnates in the patriarchs of Kabbalah. This is the order of its appearance: %0aAbraham, Moses, Rabbi Shimon Bar-Yochai, the ARI (Rabbi Isaac Luria), and %0aRabbi Yehuda Ashlag (Baal HaSulam). Each incarnation of this soul promotes %0ahumanity to a new spiritual degree and leaves its mark in Kabbalah books, which %0aserve the generations that follow. %0a%0aAn example of this process can be found in special sections of The Zohar %0acalled Raia Meheimna (The Loyal Shepherd). In these parts, Rashbi speaks from %0aa state of clothing in Moses' soul. Another example of this is the book, Shaar %0aHaGilgulim (Gate of Reincarnations), where Rashbi speaks from a state of clothing %0ain the soul of the ARI. %0a%0aThe Book of Zohar is undoubtedly unique and one of the world's most %0arenowned compositions. Since its writing, thousands of stories have been %0alinked to The Zohar, and the book is still shrouded in mystery today. The %0afascination around it is so great that even though the book is completely %0aincomprehensible to our generation without proper interpretation, millions %0aof people diligently read it. %0a%0aRASHBI'S DEPARTURE %0a%0aAccording to tradition, Rabbi Shimon Bar-Yochai passed away in the presence %0aof his friends on Lag BaOmer (the 33 rd day of the Omer count, which starts on %0athe first day of Passover) of the year 160 CE, and was buried in Meron. With his %0adeath, the soul of a giant Kabbalist completed its task in our world. %0a%0aRashbi fulfilled his destination. Hundreds of thousands visit his gravesite %0ayearly, trying to sense some of the Light that he had brought to the world. The %0agreatest Kabbalists praise his composition and repeatedly claim that The Book of %0aZohar is destined to bring redemption to the world. %0a%0aRav Kook, the first Chief Rabbi of Israel, writes about the Zohar (Ohr %0aYakar): "This composition, called The Book of Zohar, is like Noah's Ark, where %0athere were many kinds, but those kinds and families could not exist unless %0aby entering the ark. ...Thus the righteous will enter the secret of the Light %0aof this composition to persist, and thus is the virtue of the composition, %0athat immediately when engaging, with his desire for the love of God, it %0awill draw him as a magnet draws the iron. And he will enter it to save his %0a%0a%0a%0aPrologue %0a%0a%0a%0a11 %0a%0a%0a%0asoul and spirit and his correction. And even if he is wicked, there is no fear %0ashould he enter." %0a%0aWe are living in a historic time. The soul of Rashbi is completing its mission %0ain our generation, and thanks to this spiritual giant, who lived nearly 2,000 %0ayears ago, the wisdom of Kabbalah is emerging so we may all ascend to a life of %0aeternity and wholeness. %0a%0aABOUT THE BOOK OF ZOHAR %0a%0aThe Book of Zohar is the most mysterious, and at the same time the most %0asignificant book of Kabbalah. In recent years, it has become increasingly clear %0athat although The Book of Zohar was written eighteen centuries ago, it was %0aactually written for our time. Rabbi Yehuda Ashlag (Baal HaSulam) opened it %0ato us and rekindled what has long been forgotten from our hearts. %0a%0aThe depth of the wisdom in The Book of Zohar is locked behind a thousand doors. %0a%0a-Rabbi Yehuda Ashlag (Baal HaSulam), "Preface to the Book of Zohar" %0a%0aSince the dawn of humanity, unique individuals climbed the spiritual ladder %0aand achieved the highest level of bonding with the Upper Force, the Creator. %0aWe call those people "Kabbalists." %0a%0aThrough this bonding, they came to understand that the whole of reality, %0afrom the highest spiritual worlds down to our world, is founded on love and %0abestowal. They realized that there is nothing in the world except for this Force, %0aand that everything that happens in reality was made only to bring humanity to %0apermanent existence with this sensation. %0a%0aKabbalists have searched and found the answers to every question they %0aasked— the purpose of our lives, the structure of the world, and how we can %0adetermine our destiny. They wrote about what they discovered in books such as %0aRaziel Hamalaach (The Angel Raziel), Sefer Yetzira (The Book of Creation), Etz Chaim %0a(The Tree of Life), and others. %0a%0aOf all the books, the most seminal, mysterious, and profound is The Book %0aof Zohar (The Book of Radiance). The Book of Zohar describes the hidden system %0aof the Upper Guidance. It depicts the worlds, the great powers that govern %0athem, and how one who chooses to study Kabbalah affects his or her own fate %0aand that of humanity. %0a%0a%0a%0a12 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar also explains how every event cascades from the Upper World to %0aours, and the dressings it acquires here. But what makes The Zohar unique is the %0afact that it was not written for its contemporaries; it was rather intended for a %0ageneration that would live two millennia later— our generation. %0a%0aREMOVING THE COVERS %0a%0aOur generation stands at the very threshold of redemption, if we only know how to spread %0athe wisdom of the hidden in the masses. %0a%0a-Baal HaSulam, "Messiah's Horn" %0a%0aThe twentieth century has brought unprecedented changes. These opened the %0adoor to a whole new phase, which the greatest Kabbalists have been describing %0afor centuries in their writings. The greatest change of all is that in this century, %0aKabbalists state that studying Kabbalah is not only permitted, it is a must! %0a%0aIt is written in The Book of Zohar itself that the wisdom of Kabbalah would %0abegin its spreading from the year 1840. The great 18 th century Kabbalist, The %0aVilna Gaon (GRA), wrote in his book Kol HaTor (Voice of the Turtledove) that the %0aprocess of the revelation of the Kabbalah would begin in 1990. In his book, Even %0aShlemah (A Perfect and Just Weight), Chapter 11, he even stated that redemption %0adepends primarily on the study of Kabbalah. %0a%0aRav Kook explained that "the great spiritual questions that were once %0aresolved only for the great and the excellent, must now be resolved to various %0adegrees within the entire nation" (Eder HaYaker ve Ikvey HaTzon, p. 144). %0a%0aBut it was Baal HaSulam who turned the words of the Kabbalists from %0aa vision to a tangible reality. He clearly saw that the time had come to allow %0aeveryone to study The Book of Zohar. He claimed that by studying The Zohar, the %0awhole of humanity would rise and attain the spiritual world. %0a%0aWith this vision in mind, Baal HaSulam devoted himself to composing a %0acomprehensive, accurate, and systematic interpretation of The Book of Zohar. %0aHis goal was to unveil the book to the public and make it suitable for the souls %0aof our generation. %0a%0aIn the introduction to his commentary on The Zohar, he explained why he %0awrote it: "I have named the commentary HaSulam (The Ladder) to indicate that %0athe function of my commentary is as the function of any ladder. If you have %0aan attic filled with abundance, you need only a ladder to climb it, and all the %0abounty in the world will be in your hands." %0a%0a%0a%0aPrologue %0a%0a%0a%0a13 %0a%0a%0a%0aACCELERATING THE SPREAD OF THE WISDOM %0a%0aAll the Kabbalists dreamed of our generation, when the whole of humanity %0acould discover the wondrous things they already had. They prayed that through %0areading the authentic sources they had left for us, we, too, would achieve %0abonding with the Upper Force, as did they. In his commentary on The Book of %0aZohar, Baal HaSulam threw us a rope, "a life buoy." In doing so, he paved our %0away to a future of abundance and prosperity. %0a%0aBaal HaSulam called upon us to give greater weight to engagement in the %0awisdom of Kabbalah, and accelerate the spreading of the wisdom. He knew %0athat only the wisdom of Kabbalah could elevate the world to the spiritual %0arealm and into the eternity that Kabbalists had been experiencing throughout %0athe generations. %0a%0aWebster's Dictionary defines a generation as "a group of individuals born %0aand living contemporaneously (at the same time)." In Kabbalah, however, a %0ageneration is a spiritual phase. According to great Kabbalists such as the Holy %0aARI, our generation— our spiritual phase— began in the sixteenth century. %0a%0aThe longer we wait with the spiritual ascension our generation is meant to %0aachieve, the greater will be our discomfort. The spiritual realm, which determines %0awhat happens in our world, will increase its pressure on us until we decide to %0aachieve this realm for ourselves. %0a%0aIn the words of the great Kabbalist Rabbi Avraham Azulai (in his %0aintroduction to the book, Ohr ha Chama (Light of the Sun)), "I have found it %0awritten that the above decree to not openly engage in the wisdom of truth was %0aonly for a time— until the end of the 1490. From then on ... the sentence has %0abeen lifted, and permission was given to engage in The Book of Zohar. And from %0athe year 1540 it has become praiseworthy to engage in great numbers since it %0ais by virtue of this the Messiah King will come, and not by another virtue. It is %0ainappropriate to be negligent." %0a%0a"But the wise shall understand that their elevation comes from the Creator, %0athe Tree of Life. And they who are righteous shall shine like the brightness of %0athe firmament" (Daniel, 12:3). 2 %0a%0a"By virtue of Rabbi Shimon's composition, The Book of Zohar, from the %0aSupernal Force that brings all things back to the Creator, at the end of days, the %0achildren of Israel will taste from the Tree of Life, which is The Book of Zohar; and %0athey will be redeemed from exile by the Creator's mercy" (Naso, 90). %0a%0a2 To facilitate comprehension of the spiritual meaning of ancient Hebrew sources, quotes are not %0adirect translations, but rather reflect the Kabbalistic meaning of the texts.

Rabbi Shimon %0a%3c Bar-Yochai (Rashbi) put it all on paper %0a%3c and then hid it, as humanity was not %0a%3c ready for it. Today, we are ready for the %0a%3c revelation of The Book of Zohar. %0a%3c %0a%3c Rabbi Shimon Bar-Yochai (Rashbi), %0a%3c author of The Book of Zohar (The Book of %0a%3c Radiance) was a Tana— a great sage in the early Common Era centuries.

"Who am I?" and "How is %0a%3c the world built?" plagued him and demanded answers. %0a%3c %0a%3c In those days, life in Galilee was very harsh: the Romans persecuted Jews %0a%3c and continually invented new laws to make their lives more difficult. Among %0a%3c these laws was a decree that prohibited Jews from studying the Torah (then %0a%3c synonymous with Kabbalah). %0a%3c %0a%3c 1 The articles, "About Rabbi Shimon Bar-^lbchai" and "About The Book of Zohar" are presented %0a%3c here courtesy of the paper Kabbalah Today. %0a%3c %0a%3c 7 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c A77A.1 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 711' 7^ |) W '21 • %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ( I %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 8 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c However, despite the Romans' prohibition, Rashbi immersed himself in the %0a%3c Kabbalah and tried to understand its subtle teachings.

Almost all of his 24,000 students died in plagues, and in fierce battles %0a%3c against the Romans. Of the 24,000 students, only five survived, and Rashbi was %0a%3c among them. %0a%3c %0a%3c Rashbi was among the leaders of the Bar-Kokheva revolt against the Roman %0a%3c rule in the land of Israel.

The %0a%3c greatest Kabbalists praise his composition and repeatedly claim that The Book of %0a%3c Zohar is destined to bring redemption to the world. %0a%3c %0a%3c Rav Kook, the first Chief Rabbi of Israel, writes about the Zohar (Ohr %0a%3c Yakar): "This composition, called The Book of Zohar, is like Noah's Ark, where %0a%3c there were many kinds, but those kinds and families could not exist unless %0a%3c by entering the ark. ...Thus the righteous will enter the secret of the Light %0a%3c of this composition to persist, and thus is the virtue of the composition, %0a%3c that immediately when engaging, with his desire for the love of God, it %0a%3c will draw him as a magnet draws the iron. And he will enter it to save his %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Prologue %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 11 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c soul and spirit and his correction. And even if he is wicked, there is no fear %0a%3c should he enter." %0a%3c %0a%3c We are living in a historic time. The soul of Rashbi is completing its mission %0a%3c in our generation, and thanks to this spiritual giant, who lived nearly 2,000 %0a%3c years ago, the wisdom of Kabbalah is emerging so we may all ascend to a life of %0a%3c eternity and wholeness. %0a%3c %0a%3c ABOUT THE BOOK OF ZOHAR %0a%3c %0a%3c The Book of Zohar is the most mysterious, and at the same time the most %0a%3c significant book of Kabbalah. In recent years, it has become increasingly clear %0a%3c that although The Book of Zohar was written eighteen centuries ago, it was %0a%3c actually written for our time. Rabbi Yehuda Ashlag (Baal HaSulam) opened it %0a%3c to us and rekindled what has long been forgotten from our hearts. %0a%3c %0a%3c The depth of the wisdom in The Book of Zohar is locked behind a thousand doors. %0a%3c %0a%3c -Rabbi Yehuda Ashlag (Baal HaSulam), "Preface to the Book of Zohar" %0a%3c %0a%3c Since the dawn of humanity, unique individuals climbed the spiritual ladder %0a%3c and achieved the highest level of bonding with the Upper Force, the Creator. %0a%3c We call those people "Kabbalists." %0a%3c %0a%3c Through this bonding, they came to understand that the whole of reality, %0a%3c from the highest spiritual worlds down to our world, is founded on love and %0a%3c bestowal. They realized that there is nothing in the world except for this Force, %0a%3c and that everything that happens in reality was made only to bring humanity to %0a%3c permanent existence with this sensation. %0a%3c %0a%3c Kabbalists have searched and found the answers to every question they %0a%3c asked— the purpose of our lives, the structure of the world, and how we can %0a%3c determine our destiny. They wrote about what they discovered in books such as %0a%3c Raziel Hamalaach (The Angel Raziel), Sefer Yetzira (The Book of Creation), Etz Chaim %0a%3c (The Tree of Life), and others. %0a%3c %0a%3c Of all the books, the most seminal, mysterious, and profound is The Book %0a%3c of Zohar (The Book of Radiance). The Book of Zohar describes the hidden system %0a%3c of the Upper Guidance. It depicts the worlds, the great powers that govern %0a%3c them, and how one who chooses to study Kabbalah affects his or her own fate %0a%3c and that of humanity. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 12 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar also explains how every event cascades from the Upper World to %0a%3c ours, and the dressings it acquires here. But what makes The Zohar unique is the %0a%3c fact that it was not written for its contemporaries; it was rather intended for a %0a%3c generation that would live two millennia later— our generation. %0a%3c %0a%3c REMOVING THE COVERS %0a%3c %0a%3c Our generation stands at the very threshold of redemption, if we only know how to spread %0a%3c the wisdom of the hidden in the masses. %0a%3c %0a%3c -Baal HaSulam, "Messiah's Horn" %0a%3c %0a%3c The twentieth century has brought unprecedented changes. These opened the %0a%3c door to a whole new phase, which the greatest Kabbalists have been describing %0a%3c for centuries in their writings. The greatest change of all is that in this century, %0a%3c Kabbalists state that studying Kabbalah is not only permitted, it is a must! %0a%3c %0a%3c It is written in The Book of Zohar itself that the wisdom of Kabbalah would %0a%3c begin its spreading from the year 1840. The great 18 th century Kabbalist, The %0a%3c Vilna Gaon (GRA), wrote in his book Kol HaTor (Voice of the Turtledove) that the %0a%3c process of the revelation of the Kabbalah would begin in 1990. In his book, Even %0a%3c Shlemah (A Perfect and Just Weight), Chapter 11, he even stated that redemption %0a%3c depends primarily on the study of Kabbalah. %0a%3c %0a%3c Rav Kook explained that "the great spiritual questions that were once %0a%3c resolved only for the great and the excellent, must now be resolved to various %0a%3c degrees within the entire nation" (Eder HaYaker ve Ikvey HaTzon, p. 144). %0a%3c %0a%3c But it was Baal HaSulam who turned the words of the Kabbalists from %0a%3c a vision to a tangible reality. He clearly saw that the time had come to allow %0a%3c everyone to study The Book of Zohar. He claimed that by studying The Zohar, the %0a%3c whole of humanity would rise and attain the spiritual world. %0a%3c %0a%3c With this vision in mind, Baal HaSulam devoted himself to composing a %0a%3c comprehensive, accurate, and systematic interpretation of The Book of Zohar. %0a%3c His goal was to unveil the book to the public and make it suitable for the souls %0a%3c of our generation. %0a%3c %0a%3c In the introduction to his commentary on The Zohar, he explained why he %0a%3c wrote it: "I have named the commentary HaSulam (The Ladder) to indicate that %0a%3c the function of my commentary is as the function of any ladder. If you have %0a%3c an attic filled with abundance, you need only a ladder to climb it, and all the %0a%3c bounty in the world will be in your hands." %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Prologue %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 13 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ACCELERATING THE SPREAD OF THE WISDOM %0a%3c %0a%3c All the Kabbalists dreamed of our generation, when the whole of humanity %0a%3c could discover the wondrous things they already had. They prayed that through %0a%3c reading the authentic sources they had left for us, we, too, would achieve %0a%3c bonding with the Upper Force, as did they. In his commentary on The Book of %0a%3c Zohar, Baal HaSulam threw us a rope, "a life buoy." In doing so, he paved our %0a%3c way to a future of abundance and prosperity. %0a%3c %0a%3c Baal HaSulam called upon us to give greater weight to engagement in the %0a%3c wisdom of Kabbalah, and accelerate the spreading of the wisdom. He knew %0a%3c that only the wisdom of Kabbalah could elevate the world to the spiritual %0a%3c realm and into the eternity that Kabbalists had been experiencing throughout %0a%3c the generations. %0a%3c %0a%3c Webster's Dictionary defines a generation as "a group of individuals born %0a%3c and living contemporaneously (at the same time)." In Kabbalah, however, a %0a%3c generation is a spiritual phase. According to great Kabbalists such as the Holy %0a%3c ARI, our generation— our spiritual phase— began in the sixteenth century. %0a%3c %0a%3c The longer we wait with the spiritual ascension our generation is meant to %0a%3c achieve, the greater will be our discomfort. The spiritual realm, which determines %0a%3c what happens in our world, will increase its pressure on us until we decide to %0a%3c achieve this realm for ourselves. %0a%3c %0a%3c In the words of the great Kabbalist Rabbi Avraham Azulai (in his %0a%3c introduction to the book, Ohr ha Chama (Light of the Sun)), "I have found it %0a%3c written that the above decree to not openly engage in the wisdom of truth was %0a%3c only for a time— until the end of the 1490. From then on ... the sentence has %0a%3c been lifted, and permission was given to engage in The Book of Zohar. And from %0a%3c the year 1540 it has become praiseworthy to engage in great numbers since it %0a%3c is by virtue of this the Messiah King will come, and not by another virtue. It is %0a%3c inappropriate to be negligent." %0a%3c %0a%3c "But the wise shall understand that their elevation comes from the Creator, %0a%3c the Tree of Life. And they who are righteous shall shine like the brightness of %0a%3c the firmament" (Daniel, 12:3). 2 %0a%3c %0a%3c "By virtue of Rabbi Shimon's composition, The Book of Zohar, from the %0a%3c Supernal Force that brings all things back to the Creator, at the end of days, the %0a%3c children of Israel will taste from the Tree of Life, which is The Book of Zohar; and %0a%3c they will be redeemed from exile by the Creator's mercy" (Naso, 90). %0a%3c %0a%3c 2 To facilitate comprehension of the spiritual meaning of ancient Hebrew sources, quotes are not %0a%3c direct translations, but rather reflect the Kabbalistic meaning of the texts. %0a\ No newline at end of file%0a
