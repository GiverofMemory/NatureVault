text=The Intention in the Prayer %0a%0a%0a%0aIt is written in The Zohar (Veyikahel, pp. 32-52): "Each day a voice calls upon %0aall people in the world, 'This depends on you. Separate a part of yourself and %0adevote it to the Creator.'" At some point in life, thoughts and desires to draw %0acloser to the spiritual come to every person, and it depends on us whether or %0anot we heed that inner call. The voice reassures man that by casting aside his %0aneedless, transient, and earthly desires, by ceasing his endless chase for their %0aappeasement, he will attain true and eternal happiness. %0a%0aFrom this we can understand the secret meaning of prayer: he who fears %0athe Creator and directs his heart and desires in his prayer, carries out great %0aand exalted corrections. If one wishes to enter the spiritual realm and feel the %0aeator, the only thing he must do is pray, i.e., ask the Creator to correct %0a, to transform it from the nature of our world (egoistic) into the n %0airitual realm (altruistic). He will then enter eternity and trans %0ae boundaries of our world. Being completely enslaved by his egoism, man %0anable to change himself on his own. %0a%0aTo correct himself, man needs to receive the strength that exists outside of %0ahim, beyond the bounds of his egoism. He must ask to receive this strength %0ahence, the only thing man must do is pray. %0a%0aHowever, prayer is not uttered by one's mouth. Rather, it is the desire in our %0aheart, for the Creator reads the desires in our hearts. Therefore, man's only task %0ato transform his heart's desires— for his heart to wish to change its own desires %0a%0ait by himself; he must ask the Creator for it. %0a%0ato exalting the Creator's rule, faith in Hi %0agularity, His power, His ability and desire to help. All of man's effor %0acreate the only true desire within him— to feel the Creator! Here, The Zohar. %0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a465 %0a%0a%0a%0a466 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0aready attained the spiritual worlds with their desires and properties, and, %0a;ing in our world, perceive and exist in the two worlds simultaneously. %0aThe prayer the book refers to here constitutes the spiritual actions of one who %0ahas already acquired spiritual instruments, and can utilize them in exactly the %0asame way we use our hands and auxiliary means in our world. %0a%0aFirst, in the songs and hymns of the Supernal angels, and according to the %0aorder of chants sung by the sons of Israel below, Malchut adorns and corrects %0aherself as a wife who adorns herself for her husband. The sons of Israel are those %0awho wish to become Yashar (straight) and El (Creator), i.e., to draw closer to, %0aor go straight to the Creator. Such people, who exist in the Upper Worlds with %0atheir spiritual (altruistic) instruments (desires), can change the states of Higher %0aSefirot and worlds by their spiritual actions. %0a%0aOur prayer-book was compiled by the sages of the Great Assembly twenty %0acenturies ago. Before that, everyone addressed the Creator in accordance with %0awhat he or she felt. About twenty centuries ago, coarser souls began descendin %0a)ur world, which needed orderly prayers. Hence, the members of the ( %0a)ly (great Kabbalists) created the prayer book that we still use today. %0a%0arderly fashion, the prayer book expounds all the consecutive %0alan's correction. Behind the words of the prayer book, one who understands %0asees the spiritual actions that he needs to perform. This information is conveyed %0ain letters, in their forms and combinations, as well as in the sequence of senteno %0aand parts of the whole prayer. %0a%0aAccording to the order of the prayer, correction of the worlds comes first %0aby the morning blessings (See Tefilat Kol Peh) up to the prayer of Shmone Esreh, %0acorrection in a sitting position. Then, when they reach the words Emet ve Yatziv %0athat conclude Kriyat Shema, all the worlds achieve correction. And as they reach %0athe words Gaal Israel, all the corrections are to take their places; hence, they %0acontinue reciting the Shmone Esreh prayer while standing. %0a%0aIn spirituality (and, consequently, in corporeality) a person can be in one %0aof three states: lying, sitting, or standing. A newborn infant in our world and %0aa spiritually newborn person develop in the same order. Lying means that the %0aposition of the head, the legs, and the body are at the same level. In the spiritual, %0athis corresponds to the embryonic state, when all that exists in the ten Sefirot is %0athe same. This is the lowest spiritual state. %0a%0aSitting means that the head is above the body, and the body is above the %0alegs, but one cannot use his legs. Such a state is called Katnut (smallness) or VAK. %0aStanding implies absolute distinction between the levels of the head, body, and %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Intention in the Prayer %0a%0a%0a%0a467 %0a%0a%0a%0alegs. It is called Gadlut (big state) or GAR. Thus, according to one's ability to ask %0afor correction, he gradually receives strength from the Creator and grows. %0a%0aTherefore, when he reaches the words Emet ve Yatziv, everything has already %0abeen corrected: all of the worlds bear Malchut in them, while Malchut herself %0abears the Supernal King. When man reaches the words, Gaal Israel, the Supernal %0aKing advances along the degrees, along the three lines, and comes forward to %0areceive Malchut. %0a%0aThe Supernal King (the Creator), with regard to all created beings, constitutes %0aZA of the world of Atzilut, for Malchut de Atzilut is the sum of all creations. %0aEverything that was ever created, including us and all the worlds with all that %0ainhabit them, is a part of Malchut. %0a%0aIn our initial state, we are the parts of Malchut that receive the smallest %0aportion of the Creator's Light, Ner Dalcilc (tiny candle). As we draw closer to the %0aCreator in our properties (making them similar to His), we receive increasingly %0agreater Light, in proportion to our advancement, which we feel as infinite bliss, %0apeace, delight, eternity, and as a life-force. %0a%0aThe degrees of our closeness to the Creator (our "I" and Him, Malchut %0aand ZA) are described in Kabbalah using a special language: the nearing of %0aproperties is considered a transition from the state of "back to back" between ZA %0aand Malchut to the state of "face to face." The souls' union with the Creator is %0adescribed as a Zivug— sexual act between ZA and Malchut, whereupon ZA passes %0athe Light to Malchut, and each soul, in proportion to its correction, can thereby %0areceive this Light. %0a%0aNaturally, the Creator remains in a state of absolute rest, and all His alleged %0amovements are felt with regard to Malchut, depending on the changes in her %0aproperties. At times she feels Him more and at times less, and she perceives this %0aas His movement toward her. %0a%0aWe must stand in humility and awe before the Supernal King, each in his %0aplace, for He extends His right hand to Malchut in Magen Abraham, the first %0ablessing in the Shmone Esreh prayer, designating the right line. Then He puts His %0aleft hand under the head of Malchut, as it is written: "Let his left hand be under %0amy head, and his right hand embrace me" (Shir HaShirim, 2:6) in the blessing Ata %0aGibor, the second blessing in the Shmone Esreh prayer, designating the left line. %0a%0aThe entire magnificent Shir HaShirim (Song of Songs) speaks of the Supernal %0amerging of all the creatures with the Creator. Since our world is created as a %0areflection of the spiritual world, spiritual merging can only be described with the %0acorresponding words of our world. Because our world is egoistic, the spiritual, %0a%0a%0a%0a468 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aaltruistic actions, directed toward the merging of properties and desires, are %0adescribed in the words of our world as Malchut (man's soul) drawing closer to the %0aCreator in her properties, followed by their gradual unification. First, it manifests %0ain the form of an embrace, followed by a kiss, then a coition, when the soul is %0asufficiently corrected to receive the Light (Ohr Hochma) from the Creator. %0a%0aAfterward, ZA and Malchut embrace and unite in a kiss of the blessing %0aHaEl HaKadosh, designating the middle line. From this state and higher on, %0aeverything transpires in the state of a kiss, up to the last three blessings in the %0aShmone Esreh prayer. This is the spiritual, true meaning of the first three blessings %0aof the Shmone Esreh prayer. %0a%0aIn other words, if one is able to make a spiritual action that corresponds to %0athe conditions described in these blessings, he attains unity with the Creator %0athat it is called "embrace" and "kiss." The detailed explanation of the spiritual %0aactions is given in The Study of the Ten Sefirot by Rabbi Ashlag. The language of %0aThe Zohar and the Torah describes these actions with words of our world. %0a%0aThe language of Kabbalah describes them by using the names of Sefirot, %0aPartzufim, and Lights. The most complete and precise language for the description %0aof spiritual actions is the language of Sefirot. Therefore, this was the language %0achosen by Kabbalists for their inner work and for explaining to us the practice %0aand method of spiritual ascent. %0a%0aMan must aspire to the Creator in his heart and desires in order to acquire %0athe intentions that bring him to correction in all the spiritual states described in %0athis prayer— for his mouth and his heart (desires) to become a single whole, so his %0alips will not speak against the wishes of his heart. The Creator awaits only the %0asincerity of our desires so as to fulfill them at once and bring us closer to Him: %0a%0aBeloved of the soul, Compassionate Father! %0aDraw Your servant to Your will. %0a%0aYour servant will hurry like a hart, will how before Your majesty. %0a%0aTo him Your friendship will he sweeter %0a%0aThan the dripping of the honeycomb and any taste. %0a%0aMajestic, Beautiful Radiance of the universe! %0aMy soul pines for Your love. %0a%0aPlease O God, heal her now showing her the pleasantness of Your radiance. %0aThen she will be strengthened and healed %0aAnd eternal gladness will be hers. %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Intention in the Prayer %0a%0a%0a%0a469 %0a%0a%0a%0aAll-worthy One, may Your mercy be aroused %0aAnd please take pity on the son of Your beloved. %0a%0aBecause it is so very long that I have yearned intensely to see the splendor of strength. %0aThese my heart desires, and please take pity and do not conceal Yourself. %0a%0aPlease be revealed and spread upon me, my Beloved, the shelter of Your peace. %0aIlluminate the land with Your glory, we shall rejoice and be glad in You. %0aMake haste, do love, for the time has come, and pardon us as in days of old. %0a%0a(Song Yedid Nefesh) %0a%0aWhen the Creator and Malchut merge in a kiss, he who needs advice and %0aassistance can ask for it, for this state is called the "time of desire." And since %0aman appealed before the King and Queen in the twelve intermediate blessings %0aof the Shmone Esreh prayer, he thereby corrected and prepared his heart's desires %0afor the last three blessings. He aroused the Creator's desire for him, for thanks %0ato these last three blessings, he merges with the Creator in Supernal Unity. %0a%0aThe "time of desire" is an appropriate state for making requests and receiving %0athe answer— the strength for self-correction. The King and Queen are ZA and %0aMalchut. Each blessing constitutes a sequence of individual corrections of man's %0asoul. Consequently, man ascends to a Higher spiritual level. Thus, he gradually %0aattains Supernal Unity with the Creator. %0a%0aThen, he must fall on his face, and when Malchut holds the souls within %0aher, submit his soul to the Creator's absolute power, as this is the appropriate %0atime (state) to entrust one's soul amongst all the other souls, for Malchut is the %0asource of life. %0a%0aTo fall on one's face and entrust one's soul means that man has but a %0asingle desire— to completely rid himself of his egoistic desires, and receive the %0aCreator's altruistic desires in their stead. Upon receiving the Creator's desires, %0aman becomes similar to Him, and to the extent of his similarity, he merges with %0athe Creator. By merging with the Creator, man acquires all that the Creator has: %0aimmortality, complete knowledge of all creation, might, and perfection. %0a%0aThe secret of the Light is available only to the chosen ones: when Malchut %0aholds human souls by her single desire to merge with the Creator (because the %0asame desire fills man's heart), he submits himself entirely to the aspiration for %0athis merging, so as to include his soul in the collective merging between Malchut %0aand the Creator. And if his soul is received by the Creator, man instantly merges %0awith Him and enters the source of life (Tzror HaChaim), both in this world and %0ain the world to come. %0a%0a%0a%0a470 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0a%0apiritual %0a%0a%0a%0aough Kabbalah is considered a secret teaching, it holds no seer %0aas secret only by those who are yet unable to create the spirit %0aorgans within themselves with which to perceive their surroundings. We are %0athe only ones who conceal our surroundings from ourselves in default c %0acorresponding sensory organs. %0a%0aThe King (Creator, ZA) and Queen (Malchut) must be connected to the souls %0aon all sides, Above and below, and be adorned with the souls of the righteous %0a(those who wish to merge with the Creator, entrust their souls to Him). And if %0aman directs all the intentions of his heart (desires) to this goal and completely %0asubmits his soul to the Creator's will, the Creator makes peace and a covenant %0awith him (both in the Upper Covenant, called Yesod, and in the lower covenant). %0aHe blesses Malchut by this peace and covenant, and surrounds her on all sides. %0a%0aUnity on all sides means that the souls attain similarity with the Creator %0ain all their properties. The righteous are those who want to merge with the %0aCreator, attain the entire creation, and as a result, discover the righteousness of %0aCreator, who created and thus governs them. Those who wish to justify %0a%0a"righteous." %0a%0agh they have not yet reached this state and are only er %0aif only at the very beginning of their path, and they are yet to corre %0aeven a single desire and only feel the smallest aspiration to draw closer %0athe Creator, they are already called "righteous," after this desire. The Creator %0asurrounds Malchut on all sides, and Malchut feels Him with all of her corrected %0aproperties, sensations. %0a%0aThus, man also receives the name Shalom (peace), for he has made a covenant %0awith Malchut below, similar to the covenant of the Sefira Yesod Above. And when %0asuch a man leaves our world, his soul rises through all the Heavens and none %0astand in its way, and the Creator calls for it and says: "Let Peace come." The soul %0areveals the thirteen elevations of the holy peach and no one stands in its way. %0aHence, happy is he who makes an offering to the Creator. %0a%0aAs soon as the soul tears itself from egoism altogether, it completely merges %0awith the Creator and is no longer obliged to descend into this world, clothe in a %0aphysical body, and receive an additional portion of egoistic desires. An offering %0ato the Creator signifies rejection of the body's egoistic desires; it is called a %0a"sacrifice," for our body is no different from that of an animal. %0a%0aTherefore, the aspiration to rid oneself of the animate body and its desires %0ais called an "offering." Depending on the kind of desires man is already able %0ato wish to rid himself of, his offering takes the form of a bird (one part of his %0a%0a%0a%0a%0aThe Intention in the Prayer %0a%0a%0a%0a471 %0a%0a%0a%0adesires) or cattle (another part). Certain parts of The Zohar and some of the %0aARI's compositions discuss this matter in great detail. %0a%0aRabbi Chiya raised his voice: "Oh, Rabbi Shimon, you are alive, and I was %0aalready mourning over you! Yet, it is not you that I mourn for, but for all my %0afriends and for the whole world that will remain orphans after you." Rabbi %0aShimon is like a torchlight, shining both Above and below. With this Light %0abelow, he illuminates the whole world. Woe unto this world when this Light will %0aleave it and rise up Above. Who will shine in this world with the Light of the %0aTorah? Rabbi Aba rose, kissed Rabbi Chiya, and said, "If such words are within %0ayou, I thank the Creator for sending me to you, so that I could be closer to you. %0aHow happy I am with my lot!" %0a%0aAll of the characters described in The Zohar are spiritual objects, Partzufim. As %0adoes the whole Torah, The Zohar speaks only of things that exist in the spiritual %0aworlds, rather than in our world. Therefore, all of the objects, animals, plants, %0aand people described in The Book of Zohar constitute spiritual degrees, desires, %0aand Partzufim. %0a%0aCreator deliberately sends into our world special souls that are close to %0aelp all the others to attain the spiritual in this lifetime, while they are %0ain this world. These great Kabbalists serve as guides for those who have realiz %0a%0aRabbi Yehudah said after him: When the Creator told Moshe to choose %0aamong the people those who are wise and understanding, Moshe looked at the %0apeople and could not find any. Then he was instructed to pick the heads of the %0atribes who were known for their wisdom. The word "understanding" is not used %0ahere, for the degree of the understanding is higher than that of the wise. What is %0athe difference between one who is wise and one who understands? Wise is one %0awho learns from a Rav (Teacher) and wants to attain wisdom. Wise is one who %0aknows all that he has to know. %0a%0aHe who understands consists of several levels-degrees, for he sees into every %0athing and knows for himself and for others. The mark of him who understands %0ais formulated in the phrase: "The righteous one knows his animal soul." The %0arighteous one signifies Yesod that passes the Light to Malchut (animal), for the %0aGematria of HaVaYaH of Malchut is fifty-two = BON = BeHeMaH (beast) = Bet- %0aHeyMem-Hey = 2 + 5 + 40 + 5 = 52. %0a%0aMalchut constitutes the level called "wise at heart," as wisdom is found %0awithin the heart. But he who understands, sees Above and below, for himself %0aand for others. He who is wise designates Malchut, for it is Malchut that reveals %0a%0a%0a%0a472 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0awisdom. He who understands is Yesod that stands above Malchut. Ohr Hochma %0ain Malchut shines only from below upwards. It is impossible to receive the Light %0afrom Above downwards, as it would surely enter egoistic desires. Therefore, it %0ais said that the wise (Hacham) sees only for himself, from himself upwards, and %0acannot pass the Light to others below. %0a%0aIt is hence said that wisdom is found within the heart, as the heart receives %0afrom below upwards; whereas he who understands (the Sefira Yesod, Tzadik, %0athe righteous one) shines with the Light of Mercy, Ohr Hassadim, from Above %0adownwards. He sees that he receives for himself, and shines upon the others, i.e., %0ashines upon Malchut, as it is written: "The righteous knows his animal soul." %0a

Separate a part of yourself and %0a%3c devote it to the Creator.'" At some point in life, thoughts and desires to draw %0a%3c closer to the spiritual come to every person, and it depends on us whether or %0a%3c not we heed that inner call. The voice reassures man that by casting aside his %0a%3c needless, transient, and earthly desires, by ceasing his endless chase for their %0a%3c appeasement, he will attain true and eternal happiness. %0a%3c %0a%3c From this we can understand the secret meaning of prayer: he who fears %0a%3c the Creator and directs his heart and desires in his prayer, carries out great %0a%3c and exalted corrections. If one wishes to enter the spiritual realm and feel the %0a%3c eator, the only thing he must do is pray, i.e., ask the Creator to correct %0a%3c , to transform it from the nature of our world (egoistic) into the n %0a%3c iritual realm (altruistic).

Since our world is created as a %0a%3c reflection of the spiritual world, spiritual merging can only be described with the %0a%3c corresponding words of our world. Because our world is egoistic, the spiritual, %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 468 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c altruistic actions, directed toward the merging of properties and desires, are %0a%3c described in the words of our world as Malchut (man's soul) drawing closer to the %0a%3c Creator in her properties, followed by their gradual unification. First, it manifests %0a%3c in the form of an embrace, followed by a kiss, then a coition, when the soul is %0a%3c sufficiently corrected to receive the Light (Ohr Hochma) from the Creator. %0a%3c %0a%3c Afterward, ZA and Malchut embrace and unite in a kiss of the blessing %0a%3c HaEl HaKadosh, designating the middle line. From this state and higher on, %0a%3c everything transpires in the state of a kiss, up to the last three blessings in the %0a%3c Shmone Esreh prayer. This is the spiritual, true meaning of the first three blessings %0a%3c of the Shmone Esreh prayer. %0a%3c %0a%3c In other words, if one is able to make a spiritual action that corresponds to %0a%3c the conditions described in these blessings, he attains unity with the Creator %0a%3c that it is called "embrace" and "kiss." The detailed explanation of the spiritual %0a%3c actions is given in The Study of the Ten Sefirot by Rabbi Ashlag. The language of %0a%3c The Zohar and the Torah describes these actions with words of our world. %0a%3c %0a%3c The language of Kabbalah describes them by using the names of Sefirot, %0a%3c Partzufim, and Lights. The most complete and precise language for the description %0a%3c of spiritual actions is the language of Sefirot. Therefore, this was the language %0a%3c chosen by Kabbalists for their inner work and for explaining to us the practice %0a%3c and method of spiritual ascent. %0a%3c %0a%3c Man must aspire to the Creator in his heart and desires in order to acquire %0a%3c the intentions that bring him to correction in all the spiritual states described in %0a%3c this prayer— for his mouth and his heart (desires) to become a single whole, so his %0a%3c lips will not speak against the wishes of his heart. The Creator awaits only the %0a%3c sincerity of our desires so as to fulfill them at once and bring us closer to Him: %0a%3c %0a%3c Beloved of the soul, Compassionate Father! %0a%3c Draw Your servant to Your will. %0a%3c %0a%3c Your servant will hurry like a hart, will how before Your majesty. %0a%3c %0a%3c To him Your friendship will he sweeter %0a%3c %0a%3c Than the dripping of the honeycomb and any taste. %0a%3c %0a%3c Majestic, Beautiful Radiance of the universe! %0a%3c My soul pines for Your love. %0a%3c %0a%3c Please O God, heal her now showing her the pleasantness of Your radiance. %0a%3c Then she will be strengthened and healed %0a%3c And eternal gladness will be hers. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Intention in the Prayer %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 469 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c All-worthy One, may Your mercy be aroused %0a%3c And please take pity on the son of Your beloved. %0a%3c %0a%3c Because it is so very long that I have yearned intensely to see the splendor of strength. %0a%3c These my heart desires, and please take pity and do not conceal Yourself. %0a%3c %0a%3c Please be revealed and spread upon me, my Beloved, the shelter of Your peace. %0a%3c Illuminate the land with Your glory, we shall rejoice and be glad in You. %0a%3c Make haste, do love, for the time has come, and pardon us as in days of old. %0a%3c %0a%3c (Song Yedid Nefesh) %0a%3c %0a%3c When the Creator and Malchut merge in a kiss, he who needs advice and %0a%3c assistance can ask for it, for this state is called the "time of desire." And since %0a%3c man appealed before the King and Queen in the twelve intermediate blessings %0a%3c of the Shmone Esreh prayer, he thereby corrected and prepared his heart's desires %0a%3c for the last three blessings. He aroused the Creator's desire for him, for thanks %0a%3c to these last three blessings, he merges with the Creator in Supernal Unity. %0a%3c %0a%3c The "time of desire" is an appropriate state for making requests and receiving %0a%3c the answer— the strength for self-correction. The King and Queen are ZA and %0a%3c Malchut. Each blessing constitutes a sequence of individual corrections of man's %0a%3c soul. Consequently, man ascends to a Higher spiritual level. Thus, he gradually %0a%3c attains Supernal Unity with the Creator. %0a%3c %0a%3c Then, he must fall on his face, and when Malchut holds the souls within %0a%3c her, submit his soul to the Creator's absolute power, as this is the appropriate %0a%3c time (state) to entrust one's soul amongst all the other souls, for Malchut is the %0a%3c source of life. %0a%3c %0a%3c To fall on one's face and entrust one's soul means that man has but a %0a%3c single desire— to completely rid himself of his egoistic desires, and receive the %0a%3c Creator's altruistic desires in their stead. Upon receiving the Creator's desires, %0a%3c man becomes similar to Him, and to the extent of his similarity, he merges with %0a%3c the Creator. By merging with the Creator, man acquires all that the Creator has: %0a%3c immortality, complete knowledge of all creation, might, and perfection. %0a%3c %0a%3c The secret of the Light is available only to the chosen ones: when Malchut %0a%3c holds human souls by her single desire to merge with the Creator (because the %0a%3c same desire fills man's heart), he submits himself entirely to the aspiration for %0a%3c this merging, so as to include his soul in the collective merging between Malchut %0a%3c and the Creator. And if his soul is received by the Creator, man instantly merges %0a%3c with Him and enters the source of life (Tzror HaChaim), both in this world and %0a%3c in the world to come. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 470 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c piritual %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ough Kabbalah is considered a secret teaching, it holds no seer %0a%3c as secret only by those who are yet unable to create the spirit %0a%3c organs within themselves with which to perceive their surroundings. We are %0a%3c the only ones who conceal our surroundings from ourselves in default c %0a%3c corresponding sensory organs. %0a%3c %0a%3c The King (Creator, ZA) and Queen (Malchut) must be connected to the souls %0a%3c on all sides, Above and below, and be adorned with the souls of the righteous %0a%3c (those who wish to merge with the Creator, entrust their souls to Him). And if %0a%3c man directs all the intentions of his heart (desires) to this goal and completely %0a%3c submits his soul to the Creator's will, the Creator makes peace and a covenant %0a%3c with him (both in the Upper Covenant, called Yesod, and in the lower covenant). %0a%3c He blesses Malchut by this peace and covenant, and surrounds her on all sides. %0a%3c %0a%3c Unity on all sides means that the souls attain similarity with the Creator %0a%3c in all their properties. The righteous are those who want to merge with the %0a%3c Creator, attain the entire creation, and as a result, discover the righteousness of %0a%3c Creator, who created and thus governs them. Those who wish to justify %0a%3c %0a%3c "righteous." %0a%3c %0a%3c gh they have not yet reached this state and are only er %0a%3c if only at the very beginning of their path, and they are yet to corre %0a%3c even a single desire and only feel the smallest aspiration to draw closer %0a%3c the Creator, they are already called "righteous," after this desire. The Creator %0a%3c surrounds Malchut on all sides, and Malchut feels Him with all of her corrected %0a%3c properties, sensations. %0a%3c %0a%3c Thus, man also receives the name Shalom (peace), for he has made a covenant %0a%3c with Malchut below, similar to the covenant of the Sefira Yesod Above. And when %0a%3c such a man leaves our world, his soul rises through all the Heavens and none %0a%3c stand in its way, and the Creator calls for it and says: "Let Peace come." The soul %0a%3c reveals the thirteen elevations of the holy peach and no one stands in its way. %0a%3c Hence, happy is he who makes an offering to the Creator. %0a%3c %0a%3c As soon as the soul tears itself from egoism altogether, it completely merges %0a%3c with the Creator and is no longer obliged to descend into this world, clothe in a %0a%3c physical body, and receive an additional portion of egoistic desires. An offering %0a%3c to the Creator signifies rejection of the body's egoistic desires; it is called a %0a%3c "sacrifice," for our body is no different from that of an animal. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, the aspiration to rid oneself of the animate body and its desires %0a%3c is called an "offering." Depending on the kind of desires man is already able %0a%3c to wish to rid himself of, his offering takes the form of a bird (one part of his %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Intention in the Prayer %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 471 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c desires) or cattle (another part). Certain parts of The Zohar and some of the %0a%3c ARI's compositions discuss this matter in great detail. %0a%3c %0a%3c Rabbi Chiya raised his voice: "Oh, Rabbi Shimon, you are alive, and I was %0a%3c already mourning over you! Yet, it is not you that I mourn for, but for all my %0a%3c friends and for the whole world that will remain orphans after you." Rabbi %0a%3c Shimon is like a torchlight, shining both Above and below. With this Light %0a%3c below, he illuminates the whole world. Woe unto this world when this Light will %0a%3c leave it and rise up Above. Who will shine in this world with the Light of the %0a%3c Torah? Rabbi Aba rose, kissed Rabbi Chiya, and said, "If such words are within %0a%3c you, I thank the Creator for sending me to you, so that I could be closer to you. %0a%3c How happy I am with my lot!" %0a%3c %0a%3c All of the characters described in The Zohar are spiritual objects, Partzufim. As %0a%3c does the whole Torah, The Zohar speaks only of things that exist in the spiritual %0a%3c worlds, rather than in our world. Therefore, all of the objects, animals, plants, %0a%3c and people described in The Book of Zohar constitute spiritual degrees, desires, %0a%3c and Partzufim. %0a%3c %0a%3c Creator deliberately sends into our world special souls that are close to %0a%3c elp all the others to attain the spiritual in this lifetime, while they are %0a%3c in this world. These great Kabbalists serve as guides for those who have realiz %0a%3c %0a%3c Rabbi Yehudah said after him: When the Creator told Moshe to choose %0a%3c among the people those who are wise and understanding, Moshe looked at the %0a%3c people and could not find any. Then he was instructed to pick the heads of the %0a%3c tribes who were known for their wisdom. The word "understanding" is not used %0a%3c here, for the degree of the understanding is higher than that of the wise. What is %0a%3c the difference between one who is wise and one who understands? Wise is one %0a%3c who learns from a Rav (Teacher) and wants to attain wisdom. Wise is one who %0a%3c knows all that he has to know. %0a%3c %0a%3c He who understands consists of several levels-degrees, for he sees into every %0a%3c thing and knows for himself and for others. The mark of him who understands %0a%3c is formulated in the phrase: "The righteous one knows his animal soul." The %0a%3c righteous one signifies Yesod that passes the Light to Malchut (animal), for the %0a%3c Gematria of HaVaYaH of Malchut is fifty-two = BON = BeHeMaH (beast) = Bet- %0a%3c HeyMem-Hey = 2 + 5 + 40 + 5 = 52. %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut constitutes the level called "wise at heart," as wisdom is found %0a%3c within the heart. But he who understands, sees Above and below, for himself %0a%3c and for others. He who is wise designates Malchut, for it is Malchut that reveals %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 472 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c wisdom. He who understands is Yesod that stands above Malchut. Ohr Hochma %0a%3c in Malchut shines only from below upwards. It is impossible to receive the Light %0a%3c from Above downwards, as it would surely enter egoistic desires. Therefore, it %0a%3c is said that the wise (Hacham) sees only for himself, from himself upwards, and %0a%3c cannot pass the Light to others below. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is hence said that wisdom is found within the heart, as the heart receives %0a%3c from below upwards; whereas he who understands (the Sefira Yesod, Tzadik, %0a%3c the righteous one) shines with the Light of Mercy, Ohr Hassadim, from Above %0a%3c downwards. He sees that he receives for himself, and shines upon the others, i.e., %0a%3c shines upon Malchut, as it is written: "The righteous knows his animal soul." %0a
