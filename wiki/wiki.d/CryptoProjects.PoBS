What sets it apart from proof of space or proof of storage based protocols which use either empty storage space as proof, or storage space partially occupied with minimally replicated data as proof and/or the time that the space is occupied [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_space|#]], is that PoBS utilizes memory hard mechanism(s) to cryptographically prove that you are storing the entire blockchain at all times while mining.  Usually hard drive space in a proof of storage mechanism is "wasted" by mining, but proof of BS puts the space to good use storing the blockchain, which can then be used to run a full node and support the network or solo mine or even run your own mining pool.  It is also much more cryptographically secure in proving you are holding all data required than typical proof of storage methods which just make "random" calls to the memory to check you have it instead of hashing the stored data. %0a%0aThe PoBS mechanism will be defined as either signing [[https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5378714.msg58828092|#]] or hashing the entire or partial blockchain (or DAG or other digital ledger or database) in order to look for a nonce. Also it would preferably use a non-parallelizable hashing algorithm such as Blake2b for example (preferably with the rounds reduced to 2-3 {argon2 also does this [[https://github.com/P-H-C/phc-winner-argon2/blob/master/argon2-specs.pdf|p.15]]} instead of 12 since we aren't too concerned about security.  Lets call it Blake2BS or blamka [[https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/53260/argon2-with-sha-256-instead-of-blake2|#]]).  The less parallelizable the algorithm, the more energy efficient mining will be. Also the blockchain can be compressed in any way desired before hashing, as long as the compression mechanism/algorithm is fully reversible, for example it leads to no data loss.  One option for compression is just hashing the entire utxo instead of blockchain.  Another less ideal option for high speed blockchains is hash the last N blocks which will also rise in size resisting asics as long as block size is not limited.%0a%0aThe difference between PoW and PoBS is not only the fact that PoBS is proving the blockchain is stored, but also the massive energy efficiency gain of PoBS over Proof of Work.  Due to the incredible memory hardness not only will this mechanism prevent power hungry ASICs forever, but also even graphics cards.  The only devices that will be able to keep up with the growing blockchain will be Servers. These servers typically only have 1 chip consuming power instead of hundreds in the case of asics.  They also will only be able to run 1 core at a time to mine.  GPU's use lots of power because they have thousands of cores all running together.  So PoBS very effectively limits the power consumption of a blockchain to be on par with Proof of Stake. That while having every advantage of Proof of Work and more in terms of decentralization and no-kyc, and none of the [[PoS|disadvantages of Proof of Stake]].%0a%0aAnother benefit is that the blockchain is stored continuously on every mining device in the world.  This fact makes you think of "what is worth storing forever"?  This is why [[Blockvault]] was created, basically the blockchain becomes a permanently stored internet that websites can curate data from.  Think of a PoBS blockchain as the one decentralized web host holding all of the worlds knowledge.%0a%0aA variant of this can be called PoCS, or proof of cryptographic storage.  It is just like PoBS except instead of storing the blockchain, you are storing another piece of data.  It differs from standard proof of storage by being memory hard and much more secure in knowing the person really is storing all the data required.%0a%0a!!Notes%0a%0a*Timing attacks [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timing_attack|#]] are not a problem for Blamka [[https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/53260/argon2-with-sha-256-instead-of-blake2|#]] [[ https://www.sjoerdlangkemper.nl/2017/12/20/blamka-hash/|#]] in this use case since we don't care to prevent people from knowing what was hashed in order to get an output.%0a%0a*May have to use blake2bp [[ https://www.blake2.net/blake2.pdf|#]] for 4 core parallelization in addition to blamka (2 rounds instead of 12) to be able to have a fast blocktime otherwise ddos attacks of invalid blocks might be tried.%0a%0a*Preimage attacks [[ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preimage_attack|#]] may be possible on blake with 2 rounds [[ https://www.blake2.net/blake2.pdf|#]] however the requirement to hash the entire blockchain negates this effect since preimage requires you to modify the message completely in every way to find a wanted hash value.  Also the time required would be much longer than the age of the universe.
