Then  burn  them  together  in %0aa  clean  spot,  and,  carefully  collecting  the  ashes,  take  care %0athat  you  mix  no  earth  with  them.  Afterwards  build  a  furnace %0aof  stones  and  clay,  in  length  fifteen  feet  and  breadth  ten,  in %0athis  manner. %0a%0aFirst  lay  the  foundation  on  both  sides,  a  foot  in  thickness, %0amaking  a  hearth  in  the  midst,  firm  and  even,  of  stone  and %0aclay,  dividing  it  into  three  equal  parts,  so  that  two  parts  may %0abe  together,  and  the  third  divided  by  itself,  by  a  wall  placed %0aacross.  Then  make  an  opening  in  each  end  of  the  breadth, %0athrough  which  wood  and  fire  may  be  introduced,  and  build- %0aing up  a  wall  around  at  the  distance  of  four  feet,  make  again %0aa  firm  and  smooth  hearth  throughout,  and  allow  the  wall  of %0aseparation  to  surmount  a  little.  After  which  make,  in  the %0alarger  space,  four  openings  on  one  side,  lengthwise,  and  four %0aon  the  other,  through  the  midst  of  the  hearth,  in  which  the %0awork  vessels  are  placed ;  also  two  openings  in  the  middle, %0athrough  which  the  flames  may  rise ;  and  building  a  wall  round %0aabout,  make  two  windows,  four  palms  in  length  and  one  in %0abreadth,  one  on  each  side,  opposite  the  openings,  through %0awhich  the  yases,  with  those  things  put  into  them,  are  intro- %0aduced and  taken  out.  Make  also  an  opening  in  the  smaller %0aspace  through  the  middle  of  the  hearth  near  the  centre  wall %0aof  separation,  and  a  window  of  the  measure  of  a  palm  near %0athe  exterior  wall  of  the  front,  through  which  whatever  is  ne- %0acessary for  the  work  can  be  placed  and  withdrawn.

Then  taking  two  parts  of  the  ashes,  of  which %0awe  have  before  spoken,  and  a  third  part  of  sand,  carefully %0apurged  of  earth  and  from  the  stones  which  you  may  have %0abrought  from  the  water,  mix  them  in  a  clean  place.  When %0athey  have  been  long  and  well  mixed  together,  taking  them %0aup  with  the  iron  trowel,  place  them  in  the  smaller  part  of  the %0afurnace  upon  the  upper  hearth,  so  that  they  may  be  heated, %0aand  when  they  have  begun  to  grow  hot  immediately  stir  them %0awith  the  same  trowel  that  they  may  not  liquefy  and  be  formed %0ainto  a  mass  by  the  heat  of  the  fire ;  and  do  this  for  the  space %0aof  one  night  and  day. %0a%0a%0aCHAPTER  V. %0a%0aOP  the  work  vases  and  of  heating  white  glass. %0a%0aDuring  which  time  take  white  clay,  of  which  jars  are  made, %0aaiid,  drying  it,  grind  it  carefully,  and,  pouring  water  upon  it, %0abeat  it  strongly  with  a  piece  of  wood,  and  make  your  vases, %0awhich  must  be  large  at  the  top  but  small  below,  having  a %0asmall  lip  round  the  mouth,  curved  inwardly.  When  they  are %0adry  take  them  with  the  pincers,  placing  them  in  the  opening %0aof  the  glowing  furnace  adapted  for  this,  and  with  the  trowel %0ataking  up  the  heated  ashes  mixed  with  sand,  fill  all  the  vases %0ain  the  evening,  and  supply  dry  wood  during  the  whole  night, %0athat  the  glass  from  the  ashes  and  sand,  being  fully  liquefied, %0amay  be  cooked. %0a%0a%0a124  THEOPUILI    LIBER   II. %0a%0a%0aCAPUT  VI. %0a%0aQUOMODO   OPERENTUR   VITREiE   TABULJE. %0a%0aMANE  autem  hora  prima  accipe  fistulam  ferreara,  et  si %0atabulas  facere  volueris  vitreas,  pone  summitatem  ejus %0ain  vas  unum,  vitro  plenum ;  cui  cum  adhaeserity  volve  ipsam %0afistulam  in  manu  tua  donee  conglomeretur  circa  eam,  quan- %0atum volueris ;  moxque  ejiciens  appone  ori  tuo  et  suffla  modi- %0acum, statimque  removens  ab  ore  tene  juxta  maxillam,  ne  forte, %0asi  retraxeris  anhelitum,  trahas  ilammam  in  os  tuum.

Have %0aalso  a  flat  stone  before  the  window  upon  which  you  beat  this %0aglowing  glass  a  little,  that  it  may  hang  equally  on  every  side, %0aimmediately  and  with  quickness,  repeatedly  blowing,  so  often %0ayou  remove  it  from  the  mouth.  When  you  see  it  look  like  a %0along  bladder,  bring  the  end  of  it  towards  the  flame,  and, %0abeing  instantly  melted,  an  opening  will  appear,  and,  the  piece %0aof  wood  fitted  for  this  work  being  taken,  make  the  opening %0aas  wide  as  is  the  glass  in  the  middle.  Then  join  its  mouth %0atogether,  namely,  the  upper  to  the  lower  part,  so  that  on  both %0asides  of  the  junction  an  opening  may  appear.  Instantly %0atouch  this  glass  near  the  tube  with  a  moist  piece  of  wood, %0ashake  it  a  little,  and  it  will  be  separated.  Presently  also  heat %0athe  tube  in  the  flame  of  the  furnace,  until  the  glass  attached  to %0ait  liquefy,  and,  with  rapidity,  place  it  upon  the  two  conjoined %0aborders  of  glass,  and  it  will  adhere ;  directly  taking  this  up, %0aput  it  into  the  flame  of  the  fiirnace  until  the  opening,  whence %0ayou  formerly  separated  the  tube,  is  liquefied,  and  the  round %0apiece  of  wood  being  taken,  dilate  it  as  the  other,  and  folding %0atogether  its  mouth  in  the  middle  and  separating  it  from  the %0apipe  with  the  moist  wood,  give  it  to  the  boy,  who,  introducing %0aa  piece  of  wood  through  the  opening,  will  cairy  it  to  the %0acooling  oven,  which  is  made  moderately  warm.  This  kind  of %0aglass  is  pure  and  white.  In  tlie  same  manner,  and  at  the %0asame  time,  make  similar  pieces  of  glass  until  you  exhaust  the %0avases. %0a%0a%0a126  THBOPHILI    LIBBR    II. %0a%0a%0aCAPUT   VII. %0a%0a%0aDE   CROCBO    VITRO. %0a%0a%0aQUOD  si  yideris  vas  aliquod  in  croceum  colorem  mutari, %0asine  illud  coqui  usque  horam  tertiaro,  et  habebis  croceum %0aleve,  et  operare  inde  quantum  volueris  online  quo  supra.

Raising  the  vase, %0awarm  it  in  the  flame,  and  you  will  dilate  that  opening, %0awhence  you  separated  the  tube,  with  the  round  piece  of %0awood,  according  to  your  desire;  you  will  also  enlarge  the %0abottom  around  the  tube  so  that  the  lower  part  may  be  hollow. %0aBut  if  you  wish  to  make  handles  to  it,  by  which  it  may  hang, %0atake  a  thin  piece  of  iron,  and,  immersing  it  in  the  pot  of  glass, %0awhen  a  little  has  stuck  to  it,  raising  it,  place  it  upon  the  vase, %0ain  whatever  place  it  may  please  you ;  and  when  it  has  adhered, %0aheat  it,  so  that  it  may  fasten  firmly.

Then  they  take  a  very  clear  glass,  like %0acrystal,  which  they  themselves  compose,  which  as  soon  as %0ait  feels  the  heat  of  the  fire  dissolves,  and  grind  it  carefully %0aupon  a  porphyry  stone  with  water,  laying  it  very  thinly  with %0aa  pencil  over  aU  the  leaf,  and,  when  it  is  dry,  they  place  it  in %0athe  fiimace  in  which  the  painted  glass  of  windows  is  heated, %0aof  which  we  shall  speak  afterwards,  supplying  fire  from %0abeechwood,  perfectly  dried  in  the  smoke.  And  when  they %0asee  the  fiame  penetrate  the  cup,  until  at  length  it  shows  a %0aslight  red  colour,  instantly  withdrawing  the  wood,  they  close %0athe  furnace,  until  it  cool  by  itself,  and  the  gold  will  never %0abe  detached. %0a%0a%0aCHAPTER  XIV. %0a%0aTHE  SAME  AS   THE   PRECEDING. %0a%0aThey  do  it  also  in  another  manner ;  taking  gold  ground  in  a %0amill,  which  is  used  in  books,  they  temper  it  with  water,  (and %0asUver  likewise,)  painting  small  circles  with  it,  and  in  them %0afigures,  or  animals,  or  birds,  in  varied  work,  and  they  cover %0athese  with  the  very  clear  glass  of  which  we  have  previously %0aspoken.

Then  arrang- %0aing the  different  tints  of  draperies,  note  down  the  colour  of %0aeach  one  in  its  place ;  and  of  any  other  thing  which  you  may %0awish  to  paint  you  will  mark  the  colour  with  a  letter.

Then  burn  them  together  in %0a%3c a  clean  spot,  and,  carefully  collecting  the  ashes,  take  care %0a%3c that  you  mix  no  earth  with  them.  Afterwards  build  a  furnace %0a%3c of  stones  and  clay,  in  length  fifteen  feet  and  breadth  ten,  in %0a%3c this  manner. %0a%3c %0a%3c First  lay  the  foundation  on  both  sides,  a  foot  in  thickness, %0a%3c making  a  hearth  in  the  midst,  firm  and  even,  of  stone  and %0a%3c clay,  dividing  it  into  three  equal  parts,  so  that  two  parts  may %0a%3c be  together,  and  the  third  divided  by  itself,  by  a  wall  placed %0a%3c across.  Then  make  an  opening  in  each  end  of  the  breadth, %0a%3c through  which  wood  and  fire  may  be  introduced,  and  build- %0a%3c ing up  a  wall  around  at  the  distance  of  four  feet,  make  again %0a%3c a  firm  and  smooth  hearth  throughout,  and  allow  the  wall  of %0a%3c separation  to  surmount  a  little.  After  which  make,  in  the %0a%3c larger  space,  four  openings  on  one  side,  lengthwise,  and  four %0a%3c on  the  other,  through  the  midst  of  the  hearth,  in  which  the %0a%3c work  vessels  are  placed ;  also  two  openings  in  the  middle, %0a%3c through  which  the  flames  may  rise ;  and  building  a  wall  round %0a%3c about,  make  two  windows,  four  palms  in  length  and  one  in %0a%3c breadth,  one  on  each  side,  opposite  the  openings,  through %0a%3c which  the  yases,  with  those  things  put  into  them,  are  intro- %0a%3c duced and  taken  out.  Make  also  an  opening  in  the  smaller %0a%3c space  through  the  middle  of  the  hearth  near  the  centre  wall %0a%3c of  separation,  and  a  window  of  the  measure  of  a  palm  near %0a%3c the  exterior  wall  of  the  front,  through  which  whatever  is  ne- %0a%3c cessary for  the  work  can  be  placed  and  withdrawn.

Have %0a%3c also  a  flat  stone  before  the  window  upon  which  you  beat  this %0a%3c glowing  glass  a  little,  that  it  may  hang  equally  on  every  side, %0a%3c immediately  and  with  quickness,  repeatedly  blowing,  so  often %0a%3c you  remove  it  from  the  mouth.  When  you  see  it  look  like  a %0a%3c long  bladder,  bring  the  end  of  it  towards  the  flame,  and, %0a%3c being  instantly  melted,  an  opening  will  appear,  and,  the  piece %0a%3c of  wood  fitted  for  this  work  being  taken,  make  the  opening %0a%3c as  wide  as  is  the  glass  in  the  middle.  Then  join  its  mouth %0a%3c together,  namely,  the  upper  to  the  lower  part,  so  that  on  both %0a%3c sides  of  the  junction  an  opening  may  appear.  Instantly %0a%3c touch  this  glass  near  the  tube  with  a  moist  piece  of  wood, %0a%3c shake  it  a  little,  and  it  will  be  separated.  Presently  also  heat %0a%3c the  tube  in  the  flame  of  the  furnace,  until  the  glass  attached  to %0a%3c it  liquefy,  and,  with  rapidity,  place  it  upon  the  two  conjoined %0a%3c borders  of  glass,  and  it  will  adhere ;  directly  taking  this  up, %0a%3c put  it  into  the  flame  of  the  fiirnace  until  the  opening,  whence %0a%3c you  formerly  separated  the  tube,  is  liquefied,  and  the  round %0a%3c piece  of  wood  being  taken,  dilate  it  as  the  other,  and  folding %0a%3c together  its  mouth  in  the  middle  and  separating  it  from  the %0a%3c pipe  with  the  moist  wood,  give  it  to  the  boy,  who,  introducing %0a%3c a  piece  of  wood  through  the  opening,  will  cairy  it  to  the %0a%3c cooling  oven,  which  is  made  moderately  warm.  This  kind  of %0a%3c glass  is  pure  and  white.  In  tlie  same  manner,  and  at  the %0a%3c same  time,  make  similar  pieces  of  glass  until  you  exhaust  the %0a%3c vases. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 126  THBOPHILI    LIBBR    II. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c CAPUT   VII. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c DE   CROCBO    VITRO. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c QUOD  si  yideris  vas  aliquod  in  croceum  colorem  mutari, %0a%3c sine  illud  coqui  usque  horam  tertiaro,  et  habebis  croceum %0a%3c leve,  et  operare  inde  quantum  volueris  online  quo  supra.

Raising  the  vase, %0a%3c warm  it  in  the  flame,  and  you  will  dilate  that  opening, %0a%3c whence  you  separated  the  tube,  with  the  round  piece  of %0a%3c wood,  according  to  your  desire;  you  will  also  enlarge  the %0a%3c bottom  around  the  tube  so  that  the  lower  part  may  be  hollow. %0a%3c But  if  you  wish  to  make  handles  to  it,  by  which  it  may  hang, %0a%3c take  a  thin  piece  of  iron,  and,  immersing  it  in  the  pot  of  glass, %0a%3c when  a  little  has  stuck  to  it,  raising  it,  place  it  upon  the  vase, %0a%3c in  whatever  place  it  may  please  you ;  and  when  it  has  adhered, %0a%3c heat  it,  so  that  it  may  fasten  firmly.  Make  of  these  handles %0a%3c what  you  please,  in  the  mean  time  keeping  the  vase  near  the %0a%3c flame,  |p  that  it  may  be  hot,  yet  not  liquefy.  Take  also  a %0a%3c little  glass  from  the  furnace,  so  that  it  may  draw  a  thread %0a%3c after  it,  and  placing  it  upon  the  vase  in  what  place  you  wish, %0a%3c revolve  it  near  the  flame,  that  it  may  adhere.

Divers  small %0a%3c vases  ai^e  also  found,  of  the  same  colours,  which  the  French, %0a%3c most  intelligent  in  this  work,  collect,  and  some  melt  the %0a%3c sapphire  in  their  furnaces,  adding  to  it  a  little  clear  and  white %0a%3c glass,  and  make  costly  plates  of  sapphire,  and  very  useful  in %0a%3c windows.

Taking  gold  leaf,  of  which  we  have  before  spoken, %0a%3c they  form  from  it  the  likeness  of  men,  or  birds,  or  beasts,  or %0a%3c leaves,  and  place  them,  with  water,  upon  the  cup  in  whatever %0a%3c place  they  wish,  and  this  leaf  should  be  somewhat  thicker %0a%3c (than  usual).  Then  they  take  a  very  clear  glass,  like %0a%3c crystal,  which  they  themselves  compose,  which  as  soon  as %0a%3c it  feels  the  heat  of  the  fire  dissolves,  and  grind  it  carefully %0a%3c upon  a  porphyry  stone  with  water,  laying  it  very  thinly  with %0a%3c a  pencil  over  aU  the  leaf,  and,  when  it  is  dry,  they  place  it  in %0a%3c the  fiimace  in  which  the  painted  glass  of  windows  is  heated, %0a%3c of  which  we  shall  speak  afterwards,  supplying  fire  from %0a%3c beechwood,  perfectly  dried  in  the  smoke.  And  when  they %0a%3c see  the  fiame  penetrate  the  cup,  until  at  length  it  shows  a %0a%3c slight  red  colour,  instantly  withdrawing  the  wood,  they  close %0a%3c the  furnace,  until  it  cool  by  itself,  and  the  gold  will  never %0a%3c be  detached. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  XIV. %0a%3c %0a%3c THE  SAME  AS   THE   PRECEDING. %0a%3c %0a%3c They  do  it  also  in  another  manner ;  taking  gold  ground  in  a %0a%3c mill,  which  is  used  in  books,  they  temper  it  with  water,  (and %0a%3c sUver  likewise,)  painting  small  circles  with  it,  and  in  them %0a%3c figures,  or  animals,  or  birds,  in  varied  work,  and  they  cover %0a%3c these  with  the  very  clear  glass  of  which  we  have  previously %0a%3c spoken.

And  when  it  is  dry,  take  the  dimensions  of  one  por- %0a%3c tion of  the  window  in  length  and  breadth,  marking  it  upon %0a%3c the  table  with  rule  and  compass  with  the  lead  or  tin ;  and  if %0a%3c you  wish  to  have  a  border  in  it,  portray  it  with  the  breadth %0a%3c which  may  please  you,  and  in  the  pattern  you  may  wish. %0a%3c Which  done,  draw  out  whatever  figures  you  will,  first  with %0a%3c the  lead  or  tin,  then  with  a  red  or  black  colour,  making  all %0a%3c outlines  with  study,  because  it  will  be  necessary,  when  you %0a%3c have  painted  the  glass,  that  you  join  together  the  shadows  and %0a%3c lights  according  to  the  (drawing  on  the)  table.    Then  arrang- %0a%3c ing the  different  tints  of  draperies,  note  down  the  colour  of %0a%3c each  one  in  its  place ;  and  of  any  other  thing  which  you  may %0a%3c wish  to  paint  you  will  mark  the  colour  with  a  letter.     After %0a%3c this  take  a  leaden  cup,  and  put  chalk,  ground  with  water, %0a%3c into  it:  make  two  or  three  pencils  for  yourself  from  hair, %0a%3c either  from  the  tail  of  the  marten,  or  badger,  or  squirrel,  or %0a%3c cat,  or  the  mane  of  the  ass,  and  take  a  piece  of  glass  of  what- %0a%3c ever kind  you  like,  which  is  in  every  way  larger  than  the %0a%3c place  upon  which  it  is  superposed,  and  fixing  it  in  the  ground %0a%3c of  this  place,  so  that  you  can  perceive  the  drawing  upon  the %0a%3c table  through  the  glass,  so  portray  with  the  chalk  the  outlines %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 138  THEOPHILI   LIBBR  II. %0a%3c %0a%3c creta  super  vitrum  exteriores  tractus  tantum.

Which  being %0a%3c dry,  with  the  reverse  of  the  pencil  make,  next  the  first %0a%3c shadows  which  you  made,  fine  lines  on  each  side,  so  that, %0a%3c between  these  tints,  and  the  '  shadows,  fine  lines  of  that  light %0a%3c colour  may  exist.

When  the  colour  shall  have  ap« %0a%3c peared  upon  both  sides,  cut  the  groove  with  a  knife  as  wide %0a%3c and  deep  as  you  wish,  so,  however,  that  the  incision  may  not %0a%3c pass  through  the  lower  end,  but  at  the  top,  where  you  pour %0a%3c in,  it  may  have  an  opening.
