November 19, 2021, at 08:07 PM by ?: [= !!Triple blockchain  Triple blockchain solves most of the remaining problems with blockchain.  The block transaction is finalized only after 2 separate blockchains confirm the transaction once.  So say there is a progpow blockchain, a randomx blockchain, and a yespower blockchain.  One can be the master and is required for instance progpow, and if it confirms the transaction by including it in a block and one or both of the others do, it is considered finalized and will be included as a checkpoint in the blockchains. Or preferably there would be no master that way if any one network is ddosed then the other two can confirm the transaction. So if you send the transaction on all 3 that would increase the average speed of finalization.  This helps solve the problem of a ddos as well as 51%25 attacks.  Lets say you send the transaction to all three networks (paying  =]%0a* [[CryptoProjects/AntminerSetup]]  . . .

The receiver does need to make sure the new key they associate with the collectible is correct though; but that is on the receiver, not the giver.  Another option to trading tokens is for the receiver to generate a new private-public key pair.  They then send the public key to the person who currently owns the token.  The current owner then sends a transaction message to the network using their current private key to sign for a transfer of ownership to the new public key.  This way a private key never needs to be shared, so it can be done on un-encrypted communication channels.  The downside to this method is that this transfer cannot be done offline, unlike the first method. =]%0a* [[CryptoProjects/Home]]  . . .
