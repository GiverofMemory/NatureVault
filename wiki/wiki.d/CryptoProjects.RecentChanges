This act of arbitrage will bring the price down per token to the price of the product (but not lower because then the arbitrage won't work) but in so doing the customer is creating lots of demand for the product.

The block transaction is finalized only after 2 separate blockchains confirm the transaction once.  So say there is a progpow blockchain, a randomx blockchain, and a yespower blockchain.  One can be the master and is required for instance progpow, and if it confirms the transaction by including it in a block and one or both of the others do, it is considered finalized and will be included as a checkpoint in the blockchains. Or preferably there would be no master that way if any one network is ddosed then the other two can confirm the transaction. So if you send the transaction on all 3 that would increase the average speed of finalization.  This helps solve the problem of a ddos as well as 51%25 attacks.
