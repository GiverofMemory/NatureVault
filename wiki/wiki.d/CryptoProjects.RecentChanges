June 16, 2021, at 05:58 PM by ?: [=You cannot send the collectible to the wrong address, so the giver never has to worry about loosing the funds.  The receiver does need to make sure the new key they associate with the collectible is correct though; but that is on the receiver, not the giver.  Another option to trading tokens is for the receiver to generate a new private-public key pair.  They then send the public key to the person who currently owns the token.  The current owner then sends a transaction message to the network using their current private key to sign for a transfer of ownership to the new public key.  This way a private key never needs to be shared, so it can be done on un-encrypted communication channels.  The downside to this method is that this transfer cannot be done offline, unlike the first method. =]%0a* [[CryptoProjects/Home]]  . . .
