These salts dissolve as the bricks get wet and then crystalize when dry.  Also freeze/thaw cycles make this worse [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8526661/|#]].  Using [[activated clay]] or probably even just acid washing the clay by treating the slip with vinegar and washing thoroughly should mitigate this weathering effect.  Another option or additionally you can acid soak the bricks after firing.  Acid should not effect the silica that gives the bricks strength since silica is insoluble in acids besides [[hydrofluoric acid]].

Also it would make sense if there are less oxygens (so less red) needed to make sulver than gold so these blocks could probably make silver easier when fired.  Bluish grey best clay for gold [[https://www.detectorprospector.com/forums/topic/14553-blue-clay-what-is-it-does-it-contain-gold/?do=findComment&comment=147177|#]] I'm wondering if the grey means high iron...%0a%0aYes blue clay high in reduced iron and aluminum [[https://beta.nsf.gov/news/scientists-discover-how-blue-green-clays-kill|#]] probably reduced by sulfur?  Yes they are found in volcanic ash layers so they were subject to sulfur in the volcanism.%0a%0aClay is silica and should fuse into perhaps [[quartz]] when fired with the potassium from the ashes.%0a%0aThe final ingredient should be tellurium powder in order to create the megavolt charge on the quartz when heated that would cause movi fusion in the red iron oxide.  Other factors needed is neutron production, neutron moderation (from the carbon), oxygen vacancy production.  However since the firing with carbon would reduce the oxidized iron, little rust/sand/tellurium balls might be needed to be dispersed throughout the block.%0a%0aPerhaps "Painting" the blocks with a gold or other precious metal producing fusion mixture when firing them like binchotan could be the best method.  For [[gold production]] for example that might be red iron oxide, volcanic or fly ash [[https://mitrask.com/determination-of-reactive-silica-in-fly-ash-gravimetrically/|#]], tellurium or sulfur powder, perhaps lithium as an electron donor when heated, perhaps biliverdin as a chelator (found in colored egg shells) or vinegar (used to turn iron into rust), etc.%0a%0aYes basically use the [[spanish gold]] recipe [[https://www.naturehacker.org/2019/11/basilisk-was-real-creature-plasma-lizard.html|#]] from [[https://archive.org/details/scheduladiversar00theo|Schedula diversarum artium]] p 221 [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basilisk#Accounts|#]].

"No prob, %0aadd 30 - 40 %25 of fired clay to normal clay and then 30%25 of charcoal or straw to the overall mix of the clay. if you get cracks when it dries you need more fired clay.

To that add 38.2%25 of that mix, of acid washed charcoal.%0a%0aFirstly acid washing removes excess salts that will cause weathering and also expansion (that leads to cracks).  Secondly the charcoal evaporates during firing causing spaces for the clay to expand into during firing which also prevents cracks.%0a%0aWhy not use sand and lime like most refractory does?  Firstly the sand doesn't bond to the clay (without lime present) so it will make the bricks have good compressive strength but be brittle.  Secondly lime reacts with carbon dioxide to produce calcium carbonate and reacts with the silica to produce calcium silicate - both of these are acid soluble so would weather if used outdoors.%0a%0ashrinkage and mechanical properties for time and temperature, up to 1100c [[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267807532_Firing_temperature_and_firing_time_influence_on_mechanical_and_physical_properties_of_clay_bricks|#]], and strength could go higheer at higher temp, it was exponential strength growth even at 1100c.%0a%0astandard bricks fired up to 1316c [[https://www.gobrick.com/docs/default-source/read-research-documents/technicalnotes/9-manufacturing-of-brick.pdf?sfvrsn=0|#]] for 10-40 hours%0a%0a1170 stoneware, 1200 porcelain and ash glaze [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ash_glaze|#]]%0a%0a!!!!Grog%0a%0aUsually the smaller the particles the better for strength [[https://www.theceramicshop.com/store/category/7/6/Grogs/|#]]%0a%0amoist mix not wet might negate the need for particles coarser than 200 mesh%0a%0aif coarser grog is needed [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grog_%2528clay%2529#CITEREFLiddell1922}https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grog_%2528clay%2529#CITEREFLiddell1922|#]] then:%0a%0a100 mesh (150 micron) sieve [[https://www.ebay.com/itm/303951058134|#]] [[https://www.ebay.com/itm/272400051375|#]] [[https://www.ebay.com/itm/322727691587|#]]%0a%0a200 mesh (75 micron) sieve [[https://www.ebay.com/itm/303696622508|#]] [[https://www.ebay.com/itm/282107223744|#]] [[https://www.ebay.com/itm/322727691587|#]]%0a%0a!!!!Carbon%0a%0aAll carbon increases expansion and can cause crumbliness if too high and firing temp not sufficient.%0a%0aoil is a good source%0a%0a!!!!Purification of slip%0a%0aneed a drill mixer, but perhaps wait until the oily clay pieces fall to the bottom, and remove them?

So exposing the part to fast moving air stream at 230c for example would be a good idea.  I would say water, but it is very hard to get water to 220c.  Oil might be a possibility.%0a%0asilicate compounds video [[https://youtu.be/QKNLYS-vEsw|#]]%0a%0a!!!!!Tempering%0a%0aCristobalite around 220c so perhaps how fast it moves through that range on cooling effects molecular structure [[https://www.thesprucecrafts.com/how-temperature-changes-clay-2746240|#]].  Perhaps once it crosses under cristobalite, reducing temp to liquid nitrogen temps might improve strength like it does in metals.%0a%0aactually it is possible to prevent cristobalite from converting from beta to alpha during cooling through 250/220c, possibly by fast cooling preventing the reorganization [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cristobalite#Structures|#]] and also perhaps with high grog amounts like the 62%25 we are trying.  Cristobalite shrinks 3-4%25 during cooling through 220 or 250c.%0a%0aAlso probably the longer you leave to vitrify at high temps, the more likely you can skip the transition to alpha cristobalite.%0a%0a!!!!!Chemical treatments%0a%0aPossible improvements from nitriding, borating, perhaps even calcifying.  I know that carbonizing (turns the clay black) reduces strength from experience.  Calcium turns the clay grey (from firing covered in ash) and seems to either improve strength or happen at vitrification temps that already improve strength of the piece, and does not seem to negatively impact the strength of the piece significantly or at all.%0a%0aFiring with ammonia containing material or borax might be worth exploring.%0a%0a!!!!!Temperature targets%0a%0a[[https://www.thesprucecrafts.com/how-temperature-changes-clay-2746240|#]]%0a%0a100c is dry shrinkage.%0a%0a120c is oil begins to burn off and smoke smells like soap.%0a%0a%25red%25220-250c%25%25 during cooling is cristobalite transition from beta (high temp) to alpha.  3-4%25 shrinkage during cooling through this transition.%0a%0a300c is carbon and sulfur burn off.  piece will look dark brown typically from reduced iron.%0a%0a350c is chemical water leaving 14%25%0a%0a%25red%25573c%25%25 is quartz inversion, 2%25 expansion through transition.%0a%0a900c is sintering, ceramic formed. still porous allows glazes to stick.%0a%0a1000c+ is maturation and vitrification, longer the more aluminum silicate needle produced and less porous the body.%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a!!!!Observations%0a%0aI notice when washing the slip at the bottom there are seemingly oily pieces of clay that resist breaking up.  More fall out of solution when acid (vinegar) is added.  Could these have natural oils in them?  If so, is acid activation really just removing the oils from the clay?  This would make sense because [[activated clay]] is good at removing contaminants from oil.  If so, then it means treating the clay with a solvent like limonene or even perhaps turpentine or pine essential oil could be used to help improve the clay.  In fact, pine oil was used in froth flotation of mineral ores, providing credence to the theory! [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pine_oil|#]]%0a%0aFireclay (kaolin) can be made from at least Montmorillonite and probably other clays by treating slip with acid and letting settle.  The kaolin is hydrophobic and will flocculate and make greasing feeling clay pieces at the bottom.  These can be scooped out or strained out and the slip can keep bineg treated with acid to cause more floc.  Other potential ways to get this to happen is treating with a hydrocarbon like fuel oil 1 (kerosene) (good), fuel oil 2 (gas oil) (better), mineral oil (best?), WD40, or biocompatible things like turpentine, pine oil, perhaps [[lanolin]] and [[beeswax]] dissolved into [[turpentine]] (the heavier the oil the better), [[essential oil]]s like possibly [[eucalyptus]], [[birch]], [[limonene]], citrus oils, [[biodiesel]], etc.%0a%0aFireclay with minimal temper can be fired to red brick (looks red when cooled) stage but not refractory (yellowish grey) without cracking.

The cao will bond withthe silica creating calcium silicate like portland. Problem is this makes the brick suseptible to dissolving in acid, and rain contains some carbonic acid.

Illite-smectite in northeastern us%0a%0a"Back in India, my ceramist parents used fine Ganges clay for their terracotta studio pieces. It was very malleable, very fine, low firing clay.  We used to dry the wet clay on plaster bats before kneading by hand and throwing on the wheel. One thing about clay, is if you let it sit wet in a bucket, some fermentation process happens slowly and it becomes more and more workable/ flexible.  Nature takes its course.  You might just want to soak it in buckets for a few months ahead of time and have a rotating cycle of Tub Soak, Plaster Bat dry, Knead, Use.  Adding a bacteria called 'bacillus subtilus' ferments the clay and makes it more plastic with a stronger bond and smoother to knead.  This is probably why clay along pond edges is so soft and slimy. Nicely broken down by the bacteria."%0a%0aPerhaps [[L reuteri]] and [[b infantis]] can help ferment the clay making it more plastic.  But acid washing with vinegar probably the same.  Plus you would want to wash the acids dissolved minerals out of the bricks either at the slip stage or after firing.  But that is a good idea to use bacterial fermentation instead of having to make vinegar separately.  It is problematic though because then you will have to maintain the clay fermentation at a specified temperature.%0a%0amaking plaster bat [[https://digitalfire.com/glossary/plaster+bat|#]]%0a%0a!!!to go through%0a%0aMontmorlinite identification by atterberg limits - tells how to ion exchange acid radicle that sodium is sokuble and calcium insoluble, sodium carbonate best same with potassium carbonate too. 4-5%25 sodium carbonate satisfied cation exchange. 4%25 is optimum to get plasticity without unnecessary swelling in a calcium clay.

Other potential ways to get this to happen is treating with a hydrocarbon like fuel oil 1 (kerosene) (good), fuel oil 2 (gas oil) (better), mineral oil (best?), WD40, or biocompatible things like turpentine, pine oil, perhaps [[lanolin]] and [[beeswax]] dissolved into [[turpentine]] (the heavier the oil the better), [[essential oil]]s like possibly [[eucalyptus]], [[birch]], [[limonene]], citrus oils, [[biodiesel]], etc.%0a%3c %0a%3c Fireclay with minimal temper can be fired to red brick (looks red when cooled) stage but not refractory (yellowish grey) without cracking.

More fall out of solution when acid (vinegar) is added.  Could these have natural oils in them?  If so, is acid activation really just removing the oils from the clay?  This would make sense because [[activated clay]] is good at removing contaminants from oil.  If so, then it means treating the clay with a solvent like limonene or even perhaps turpentine or pine essential oil could be used to help improve the clay.  In fact, pine oil was used in froth flotation of mineral ores, providing credence to the theory! [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pine_oil|#]]%0a

We used to dry the wet clay on plaster bats before kneading by hand and throwing on the wheel. One thing about clay, is if you let it sit wet in a bucket, some fermentation process happens slowly and it becomes more and more workable/ flexible.  Nature takes its course.  You might just want to soak it in buckets for a few months ahead of time and have a rotating cycle of Tub Soak, Plaster Bat dry, Knead, Use.  Adding a bacteria called 'bacillus subtilus' ferments the clay and makes it more plastic with a stronger bond and smoother to knead.  This is probably why clay along pond edges is so soft and slimy.
