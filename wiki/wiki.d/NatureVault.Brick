Yes they are found in volcanic ash layers so they were subject to sulfur in the volcanism.%0a%0aClay is silica and should fuse into perhaps [[quartz]] when fired with the potassium from the ashes.%0a%0aThe final ingredient should be tellurium powder in order to create the megavolt charge on the quartz when heated that would cause movi fusion in the red iron oxide.  Other factors needed is neutron production, neutron moderation (from the carbon), oxygen vacancy production.  However since the firing with carbon would reduce the oxidized iron, little rust/sand/tellurium balls might be needed to be dispersed throughout the block.%0a%0aPerhaps "Painting" the blocks with a gold or other precious metal producing fusion mixture when firing them like binchotan could be the best method.  For [[gold production]] for example that might be red iron oxide, volcanic or fly ash [[https://mitrask.com/determination-of-reactive-silica-in-fly-ash-gravimetrically/|#]], tellurium or sulfur powder, perhaps lithium as an electron donor when heated, perhaps biliverdin as a chelator (found in colored egg shells) or vinegar (used to turn iron into rust), etc.%0a%0aYes basically use the [[spanish gold]] recipe [[https://www.naturehacker.org/2019/11/basilisk-was-real-creature-plasma-lizard.html|#]] from [[https://archive.org/details/scheduladiversar00theo|Schedula diversarum artium]] p 221 [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basilisk#Accounts|#]].

Wood typically doesn't pyrolyse until 250c [[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13399-021-01300-8|#]] so anything below 240 might be hard to pyrolyse.  Even if it doesn't at least the process reacts lots of co2 with oxides producing carbonates that are cement.  I propose a temp of 225 C for 2 weeks or 10 days if using sulfur or 240c for 5 days (similar to binchotan if using tellurium [[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00710-014-0334-6|#]].%0a%0alaser ceramic compacts sinter at 200-300c below he melting point of the ingredients [[https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/sintering-temperature|#]]%0a%0aquartz can be made via hydrothermal synthesis [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartz#Synthetic_and_artificial_treatments|#]]%0a%0aCalcium Nitrate and nitrite used as concrete accelerators [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cement_accelerator|#]] and good neutron moderators [[https://atomicinsights.com/will-heavy-nitrogen-become-a-widely-used-fission-reactor-coolant/|#]] and is dimagnetic [[https://psiberg.com/paramagnetic-vs-diamagnetic/|#]] [[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0040402008005814|#]] [[ https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229290320_Manifestation_of_diamagnetic_chemical_shifts_of_proton_NMR_signals_by_an_anisotropic_shielding_effect_of_nitrate_anions|#]] perhaps mixing ash with urea or ammonia can achieve it.
