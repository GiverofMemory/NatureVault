csum=Small dog breeds live longer because they age slower [[ https://www.hepper.com/why-do-cats-live-longer-than-dogs/|#]] [[https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/articles/why-do-small-dogs-live-longer-than-big-dogs|#]] but the real reason why is their intestines are smaller therefore less bacterial load.  The same reason why women live longer than men, smaller gut.  In germ free animals however males live longer than females and probably (not seen the data) all breeds live the same length when germ free animals.
