PLINIUS  SECUNDUS. %0a%0a%0aTHE  PREFACE. %0a%0aBW-5SES8HUS  we  have  in  the  former  Books  treated  of %0athe  World,  and  of  the  Lands,  Nations,  Seas, %0aIslands,  and  remarkable  Cities  therein  con- %0atained. It  remainetli  now  to  discourse  of  the %0aNature  of  the  Living  Creatures  comprised  within %0athe  same :  a  point  which  would  require  as  deep %0aa  Contemplation  as  any  other  Part  whatsoever,  if  the  Mind %0aof  Man  were  able  to  comprehend  all  the  Things.  By  right %0athe  chief  place  is  assigned  to  Man,  for  whose  sake  it  appears %0athat  Nature  produced  all  other  Creatures ;  though  this  great %0afavour  of  hers  is  severe  as  set  against  all  her  other  Gifts :  so %0athat  it  is  hard  to  judge  whether  she  is  a  kinder  Parent  to %0aMan,  or  a  cruel  Step-mother.  For,  in  preference  to  all  other %0aLiving  Creatures,  the  one  she  hath  clothed  with  the  Riches  of %0aothers :  to  the  rest  she  hath  assigned  a  variety  of  Coverings : %0aas  Shells,  Barks,  Hard  Hides,  Spines,  Shag,  Bristles,  Hair, %0aFeathers,  Quills,  Scales,  and  Fleeces.

[BOOK  VII. %0a%0aStems  of  Trees  she  hath  defended  with  Bark,  which  is  some- %0atimes double,  against  the  injuries  both  of  Heat  and  Cold ! %0aMan  alone  she  hath  cast  all  Naked  upon  the  bare  Earth, %0aeven  on'  his  Birth-day,  immediately  to  cry  and  lament :  so %0athat  among  so  many  Living  Creatures  there  is  none  subject %0ato  shed  Tears  and  Weep  like  him  from  the  very  onset  of  his %0aExistence.  And  verily,  however  forward  and  active  we  may %0abe,  to  no  one  is  it  given  to  laugh  before  he  is  Forty  Days  old. %0aFrom  this  glimmering  of  Light  he  is  bound  fast,  and  hath %0ano  Member  at  liberty ;  a  thing  which  is  not  practised  upon %0athe  Young  of  any  Wild  Beast  among  us.  The  Child  thus %0aunhappily  born,  and  who  is  to  rule  all  other,  lieth  bound1 %0aHand  and  Foot,  weeping  and  crying ;  and  .receiveth  the %0aauspices  of  Life  with  Punishments,  to  make  satisfaction. for %0athis  only  Fault,  that  he  is  born  Alive.  What  madness  in %0asuch  as  think  this  the  proper  Beginning  of  those  who  are %0aborn  to  be  proud  !  The  first  Hope  of  our  Strength,  the  first %0agift  that  Time  affordeth  us,  maketh  us  no  better  than  four- %0afooted  Beasts.  How  long  ere  we  can  go  alone  !  How  long- %0abefore  we  can  speak,  feed  ourselves  !  How  long  continueth %0athe  Crown  of  our  Heads  to  palpitate, — the  mark  of  our  ex- %0aceeding great  weakness  above  all  other  Creatures !  Then %0athe  Sicknesses,  and  so  many  Medicines  devised  against  these %0aMaladies :  besides  the  new  Diseases  that  spring  up  to %0aovercome  us.  Other  Living  Creatures  understand  their %0aown  Nature ;  some  assume  the  use  of  their  swift  Feet, %0aothers  of  their  Wings ;  some  are  Strong ;  others  able  to %0aSwim ;  but  Man  knoweth  nothing  unless  he  be  taught : %0anot  even  to  speak,  or  go,  or  eat :  arid,  in  short,  -he  is %0anaturally  good  at  nothing  but  to  weep.  And  hence  some %0ahave  insisted  on  it,  that  it  is  best  for  a  man  never  to  have %0abeen  born,  or  else  speedily  to  die.  To  one  only,  of  living %0a%0a1  The  artificial  bandages  inflicted  on  new-born  children  are  the  swad- %0adling-clothes referred  to  in  St.  Luke's  Gospel,  c.  ii.  v.  7 ;  but  they  can %0ascarcely  be  numbered  among  the  necessary  evils  of  humanity,  for  they %0ahave  long  since  been  abolished  in  England.  In  the  seventh  chapter  of %0athis  Book  the  Author  dwells  again  on  the  littleness  and  misery  of  the %0ahuman  race. — Wern.  Club. %0a%0a%0aBOOK  VII.]  History  of  Nature.  175 %0a%0aCreatures  is  it  given  to  mourn,  one  only  is  guilty  of  excess, %0aand  that  in  a  vast  variety  of  ways,  and  through  every  Mem- %0aber that  he  has.  Who  but  we  are  ambitious  ?  Who  but %0awe  are  avaricious  ?  None  but  we  possess  the  extravagant %0adesire  of  living,  are  superstitious,  anxious  for  our  burial, %0aand  what  shall  be  our  fate  when  we  are  gone.  To  none  is %0aLife  more  frail ;  yet  to  no  Creature  is  there  a  greater  craving %0aafter  every  thing ;  none  suffereth  under  a  more  terrifying %0aFear ;  and  none  more  furious  in  his  Rage.  To  conclude,  other %0aAnimals  live  orderly  according  to  their  kind :  we  see  them %0aflock  together,  and  stand  against  others  of  a  contrary  kind; %0athe  Lions,  though  savage,  fight  not  one  with  another ; %0aSerpents  sting  not  Serpents :  and  even  the  very  Beasts  and %0aFishes  of  the  Sea  war  not  upon  their  own  kind :  but,  by  Her- %0acules !  the  greatest  part  of  the  evils  that  happen  to  Men  are %0afrom  the  hand  of  Man  himself. %0a%0aCHAPTER  I. %0aThe  wonderful  Forms  of  Nations. %0a%0aIN  our  reports  of  Nations  we  have  spoken  in  general  of %0athe  Human  Race  spread  over  the  Face  of  the  Earth.  Neither %0ais  it  our  purpose  at  present  to  describe  particularly  all  their %0anumberless  Customs  and  Manners  of  Life,  which  are  as %0amany  as  there  are  Assemblies  of  Men.  However,  I  think  it %0agood  not  to  omit  all,  but  to  make  relation  of  some  things %0aconcerning  those  People  especially  who  live  furthest  from %0athe  Sea;  among  whom,  I  doubt  not  but  I  shall  find  such %0amatter  as  to  most  Men  will  seem  both  prodigious  and %0aincredible.  For  whoever  believed  that  there  were  Ethio- %0apians before  he  saw  them?  what  is  it  that  seemeth  not  a %0aWonder  at  the  First  Sight?  how  many  things  are  judged %0aimpossible  before  they  are  done?  arid  the  Power  and  Ma- %0ajesty of  Nature  in  every  particular  action  seemeth  incre- %0adible, if  we  consider  the  same  severally,  and  do  not  em- %0abrace the  whole  at  once  in  the  Mind.  For,  to  say  nothing %0aof  the  Peacocks'  Feathers,  of  the  Spots  of  Tigers  and  Pan- %0athers, of  the  Colours  that  ornament  so  many  Creatures %0a%0a%0a176  History  of  Nature.  [BooK  VII. %0a%0abesides :  let  us  come  to  one  only  point,  which  to  speak  of %0aseemeth  small,  but  being  deeply  weighed,  is  a  matter  of %0aexceeding  great  regard ;  and  that  is,  the  Speech  of  so %0amany  Nations ;  so  many  Tongues ;  so  much  Variety  of %0aUtterance,  that  a  Foreigner  seems  to  be  something  different %0afrom  a  Man.  Then  to  view  the  variety  that  appeareth  in %0aour  Face  and  Countenance ;  although  there  be  not  more %0athan  Ten  Members  or  a  few  more,  among  so  many  thousand %0aof  these,  not  Two  Persons  are  to  be  found  who  are  not %0adistinct  in  Likeness :  a  thing  which  no  Art  can  perform,  in %0aa  small  number  out  of  so  many.  And  yet  thus  much  must %0aI  advertise  my  Readers,  that  I  will  not  pawn  my  credit %0afor  many  things  that  I  shall  deliver;  but  I  will  rather %0adirect  them  to  the  Authors,  who  will  answer  them  in %0aall  doubtful  points :  only  let  them  not  think  much  to  follow %0athe  Greeks,  whose  Diligence  hath  been  greater,  and  their %0aAttention  of  longer  standing. %0a%0aCHAPTER  II. %0aOf  the  Scythians,  and  the  Diversity  of  other  Nations.1 %0a%0aTHAT  there  are  Scythians,  and  even  many  kinds  of %0athem,  who  feed  ordinarily  on  Man's  Flesh,  we  have  shewn %0a%0a1  The  belief  of  the  ancients  in  the  existence  of  many  anomalous  races %0aof  mankind,  was  a  portion  of  the  science  of  the  age ;  and  not  to  have %0agiven  it  credit,  and  a  place  in  his  work,  would  have  subjected  the  author %0ato  as  much  reproach  for  scepticism,  as  the  notice  he  has  taken  of  them %0ahas  done  for  his  alledged  credulity.  And  so  far  as  Greek  authority  ex- %0atended, the  degree  of  credit  which  Pliny  assigned  to  these  strange  races, %0aappears  to  have  heen  well  founded ;  for  except  in  one  or  two  instances, %0athe  errors  appear  to  have  sprung  from  misinterpretation,  rather  than %0afrom  a  positive  departure  from  truth.  Aristotle  is  sufficient  authority %0afor  the  existence  of  a  race  of  pigmies,  who  are  also  mentioned  by  Hero- %0adotus ;  and  in  more  modern  times  that  excellent  naturalist  Belon  is  satis- %0afied concerning  them.  Nor  can  we,  even  now,  refuse  to  admit  the  possi- %0ability of  finding  their  representatives  in  the  Bushmen  still  existing  in %0aSouthern  Africa.  On  the  other  hand,  the  existence  of  men  of  enormous %0astature,  of  which  some  stupendous  instances  are  given  by  Pliny  (b.  vii. %0ac.  xvi.),  is  attested  by  profane  as  well  as  by  sacred  history.  Thus  Pau- %0a%0a%0aBOOK  VII.]  History  of  Nature.  177 %0a%0aalready,  (Book  iv.  1 2 ;  vi.  1 .)  The  thing  itself  would  be  thought %0aincredible,  if  we  did  not  consider  that  in  the  very  Middle  of %0athe  World,  even  in  Sicily  and  Italy,  there  have  been  Nations  of %0asuch  Monsters,  as  the  Cyclopae  and  Lystrigonae :  and  also  very %0a%0asanias  (in  his  "  Atticks,"  quoted  by  Bishop  Cumberland  in  his  translation %0aof  Sanchoniatho)  says,  that  he  saw  in  the  Upper  Lydia  bones  whose %0afigure  would  satisfy  any  man  that  they  were  men's  bones,  but  their  big- %0aness was  above  the  now  known  size  of  men.  He  also  mentions  the  bones %0aof  Asterius,  in  the  neighbouring  country  of  the  Milesians ;  giving  the %0adimensions  of  his  body  to  be  no  less  than  ten  cubits  long,  and  that  he %0awas  the  son  of  Anax ;  a  name  singularly  corresponding  with  a  race  men- %0ationed by  Moses,  and  the  sight  of  whom  terrified  and  humbled  the  Is- %0araelitish  spies.  It  is  not  a  little  strange,  as  Bishop  Cumberland  remarks, %0aquoting  from  Cicero  "  de  Natura  Deorum,"  that  there  is  reason  to  believe, %0aone  of  the  very  ancient  and  gigantic  persons  known  under  the  name  of %0aHercules  had  six  fingers  on  each  hand,  as  is  also  noticed  of  the  last  de- %0ascendants of  this  mighty  race,  in  the  second  book  of  Samuel,  c.  xxi.  The %0atradition  that  such  enormous  people  existed  in  the  early  ages  of  the %0aworld  is  often  referred  to  by  Homer,  and  other  ancient  writers,  who %0adrew  from  thence  the  erroneous  conclusion,  that  the  whole  human  race %0ahad,  since  their  day,  become  gradually  weaker  and  more  diminutive ; %0awhereas,  in  the  only  authentic  history  of  these  remote  ages  it  is  clearly %0aintimated,  that  this  vast  stature  was  limited  to  particular  families  or %0anations,  who  even  at  that  time  were  thought  remarkable  by  all  besides ; %0aand  who  were  finally  exterminated  by  their  neighbours,  perhaps  as  the %0aonly  resource  against  their  violence.  The  Macrocephali,  or  long  heads, %0a(mentioned  b.  vi.  c.  4)  may  be  supposed  to  have  owed  their  peculiarity  to %0athe  habit  of  employing  pressure  to  mould  their  heads  in  early  infancy %0ainto  the  compressed  and  elevated  form,  as  is  now  practised  by  some  tribes %0aon  the  continent  of  America ;  and  such  as  are  mentioned  with  exceedingly %0ashort  necks  may,  perhaps,  have  been  marked  only  with  a  personal  de- %0aformity ;  but  the  people  with  intensely  black  skin,  to  all  of  whom,  how- %0aever otherwise  different,  the  ancients  seem  to  have  assigned  indiscrimi- %0anately the  name  of  Ethiopians,  are  judged  by  Pliny  to  display  a  more %0aremarkable  phenomenon  than  all  the  strange  forms  he  has  occasion  to %0anotice ;  as  we  also  should  probably  do,  if  living  instances  had  not  ren- %0adered it  common.  We  may  include  in  another  section  those  singular %0aexamples  of  the  human  race,  which  the  author  supposes  to  be  comprised %0ain  nations,  but  which  are  more  probably  reported  as  of  rare  or  casual %0aoccurrence,  or  perhaps  nothing  beyond  an  accidental  monstrosity.  Such %0awe  know  to  be  the  case  with  the  Albinoes,  with  white  hair  and  tender %0aeyes  ;  and  perhaps  also  the  monoculous  king,  and  the  Arimaspians,  who %0aare  mentioned  also  by  Herodotus,  together  with  the  other  Cyclopaean %0aVOL.  n.  N %0a%0a%0a178  History  of  Nature.  [BOOK  VII. %0a%0alately,  on  the  other  side  of  the  Alps,1  there  are  those  that %0akill  Men  for  Sacrifice,  after  the  manner  of  those  (Scythian) %0apeople,  which  differs  but  little  from  eating  their  Flesh. %0aMoreover,  near  to  those  Scythians  that  inhabit  Northward, %0anot  far  from  the  very  rising  of  the  North-east  Wind,  and %0a%0apeople,  whose  singularities  may  have  referred  to  some  manner  in  the %0ahabitual  use  of  the  organ,  rather  than  to  an  actual  deformity.  A  third %0asection  of  these  supposed  anomalous  people  may  obviously  be  referred  to %0athe  quadrumanous  tribes :  a  class  of  creatures  so  nearly  approaching  to %0athe  external  form  of  humanity,  that  we  cannot  feel  surprised  if  ignorant %0atravellers,  who  viewed  only  at  a  distance,  and  with  minds  prepared  to %0awelcome  every  wonder  —  the  oran  outang  and  pongo  —  were  not  able  to %0adiscern  a  generic  difference  between  them  and  the  truly  human  race. %0aSuch  were  the  hairy  men  and  women  mentioned  in  the  31st  chapter  of %0athis  book,  the  satyrs,  Choromandse,  and  people  with  no  noses,  or  having %0atails,  a  figure  of  the  latter  being  found  on  an  alraxis,  or  amulet,  engraved %0aby  Montfau9on ;  but  through  the  whole  of  his  narrative  we  observe  that %0athe  author  is  careful  to  give  his  authorities,  as  being  aware  that  what %0aappeared  so  strange  must  be  made  to  rest  upon  the  credit  of  those  who %0ahad  originally  reported  it.  Some  of  these  instances,  indeed,  admit  of  no %0ainterpretation  that  we  are  able  to  afford  them ;  but  in  regard  to  one  of %0athe  strangest  of  them,  Purchas  gives  the  authority  of  Fitch,  an  English- %0aman :  "  I  went  from  Bengala  into  the  country  of  Couche,  not  far  from %0aCauchin  China.  The  people  have  ears  which  be  marvellous  great,  of  a %0aspan  long,  which  they  draw  out  in  length  by  devices  when  they  be %0ayoung."  In  addition  to  the  strange  forms  of  men  mentioned  by  Pliny, %0aDiodorus  Siculus  mentions  some  in  an  island  discovered  by  Jambulus, %0awhose  bones  were  as  flexible  as  nerves  (tendons)  :  the  holes  of  their  ears %0afar  wider  than  ours ;  and  with  tongues  deeply  cloven,  so  that  they  imi- %0atate the  song  of  birds,  and  can  ordinarily  speak  to  two  men  at  once. — %0aWern.  Club. %0a%0a1  The  people  here  referred  to  are  the  Gauls.  Caesar  (de  Bell.  Gall, %0alib.  vi.)  says,  "  The  whole  nation  of  the  Gauls  is  much  addicted  to  reli- %0agious observances,  and  on  that  account,  those  who  are  attacked  by  any  of %0athe  more  serious  diseases,  and  those  who  are  involved  in  the  danger  of %0awarfare,  either  offer  human  sacrifices  or  make  a  vow  that  they  will  offer %0athem,  and  they  employ  the  Druids  to  officiate  at  their  sacrifices ;  for  they %0aconsider  that  the  favour  of  the  immortal  gods  cannot  be  conciliated, %0aunless  the  life  of  one  man  be  offered  up  for  that  of  another :  they  have  also %0asacrifices  of  the  same  kind  appointed  on  behalf  of  the  state.  Some  have %0aimages  of  enormous  size,  the  limbs  of  which  they  make  of  wicker-work, %0aand  fill  with  living  men,  and  setting  them  on  fire,  the  men  are  destroyed %0aby  the  flames." — Wern.

Above  those  other  Scythians  called  Anthropophagi, %0athere  is  a  Country  named  Abarimon,  within  a  certain %0aextensive  Valley  of  the  Mountain  Imaus,  in  which  are %0aWild  Men,  wandering  about  among  brute  Beasts,  and %0ahaving  their  Feet  directed  backward  behind  the  Calves %0aof  their  Legs,  but  able  to  run  very  swiftly.  This  kind %0aof  Men  cannot  live  in  any  other  Climate  than  their  own, %0awhich  is  the  reason  that  they  cannot  be  conveyed  to  the %0aKings  that  border  upon  them ;  nor  could  they  be  brought %0ato  Alexander  the  Great,  as  Beton  hath  reported,  who  was %0athe  Surveyor  of  the  Journeys  of  that  Prince.  The  former %0aAnthropophagi  whom  we  have  placed  in  the  North,  Ten %0aDays'  Journey  above  the  River  Borysthenes,  are  accustomed %0ato  drink  out  of  the  Skulls  of  Men,  and  to  wear  the  Skins %0awith  the  Hair  for  Mantles  before  their  Breasts,  according %0ato  Isigonus  the  Nicean.  The  same  Writer  affirmeth,  that %0ain  Albania  there  are  produced  certain  Individuals  who  have %0athe  Sight  of  their  Eyes  of  a  bluish-grey  Colour,  who  from %0atheir  Childhood  are  grey-headed,  and  can  see  better  by %0aNight  than  by  Day.  He  reporteth  also  that  Ten  Days' %0aJourney  above  the  Borysthenes,  there  are  the  Sauromatae, %0awho  never  eat  but  once  in  Three  Days.  Crates  of  Per- %0agamus  saith,  that  in  Hellespont  about  Pariuni  there  was %0aa  kind  of  Men,  whom  he  nameth  Ophiogenes,  who,  if  one %0awere  stung  by  a  Serpent,  with  touching  only  will  ease  it; %0aand  if  they  lay  their  Hand  upon  the  Wound,  are  able  to %0a%0a1  Lib.  iv.  12,  and  lib.  vi.  17. %0a%0a2  The  griffins  are  again  mentioned,  book  x.  chap.  49. —  Wern.

These  men  were,  and  still  are,  distinct  tribes  in %0atheir  several  countries,  professing  the  power  they  claim  to  be  an  inherent %0aand  natural  function.  Lucan,  in  the  5th  book  of  his  "Pharsalia,"  gives  a %0acomplete  exposition  of  the  ancient  belief  concerning  the  charming  of  ser- %0apents. He  chiefly  describes  the  measures  which  were  taken  to  protect %0athe  Roman  camp.  When  the  encampment  was  marked  out,  the  serpent- %0acharmers  marched  around  it  chanting  their  charms,  the  mystic  sounds  of %0awhich  chased  the  serpents  far  away.  But  not  trusting  entirely  to  this, %0afires  of  different  kinds  of  wood  were  kept  up  beyond  the  furthest  tents, %0athe  smell  of  which  prevented  the  serpents  from  approaching.  Thus  the %0acamp  was  protected  during  the  night.  But  if  any  soldier  when  abroad  in %0athe  day  time  happened  to  be  bitten,  the  Psylli  exerted  their  power  to %0aeffect  a  cure.  First  they  rubbed  the  wounded  part  around  with  saliva, %0ato  prevent,  as  they  said,  the  poison  from  spreading  while  they  assayed %0atheir  arts  to  extract  it :  — %0a%0a"  Then  sudden  he  begins  the  magic  song, %0a%0aAnd  rolls  the  numbers  hasty  o'er  his  tongue ; %0a%0aSwift  he  runs  on,  nor  pauses  once  for  breath, %0a%0aTo  stop  the  progress  of  approaching  death ; %0a%0aHe  fears  the  cure  might  suffer  by  delay, %0a%0aAnd  life  be  lost  but  for  a  moment's  stay. %0a%0aThus  oft,  though  deep  within  the  veins  it  lies, %0a%0aBy  magic  numbers  chased,  the  mischief  flies : %0a%0aBut  if  it  hear  too  slow,  if  still  it  stay, %0a%0aAnd  scorn  the  potent  charmer  to  obey ; %0a%0aWith  forceful  lips  he  fastens  on  the  wound, %0a%0aDrains  out  and  spits  the  venom  to  the  ground." — ROWE. %0aLane  ("Modern  Egyptian")  gives  a  particular  account  of  the  different %0amethods  made  use  of  by  the  Psylli  of  the  present  day  when  exhibiting %0atheir  supposed  powers.  As  to  the  pretensions  of  ancient  as  well  as  mo- %0adern serpent-charmers,  of  being  in  their  own  persons  insensible  to  the %0apoison  of  the  reptiles,  there  is  no  satisfactory  proof  of  it :  indeed  numerous %0ainstances  to  the  contrary  have  occurred ;  and  where  they  escape  unharmed, %0ait  is  to  be  attributed  to  the  poison  fangs  having  been  previously  extracted, %0aor  to  their  fearless  handling  of  the  deadly  creatures. — See  the  note  on %0aPs.

These  Men  had  naturally  in %0atheir  Bodies  a  Poison  fatal  to  Serpents,  so  that  by  the %0aSmell  of  it  they  were  able  to  stupify  them.  And  by %0athis  means  they  used  to  try  the  Chastity  of  their  Wives. %0aFor  as  soon  as  their  Children  were  born,  they  exposed %0athem  to  the  most  furious  Serpents ;  for  these  would  not  fly %0afrom  them  if  they  were  begotten  in  Adultery.  This  Nation, %0ain  general,  hath  been  almost  entirely  extirpated  by  the %0aNasamones,  who  now  inhabit  those  parts ;  but  a  kind  of %0athese  Men  remaineth  still,  descended  from  those  who  fled, %0aor  else  who  were  not  present  when  the  Battle  was  fought;  but %0athey  exist  in  small  Companies.  In  like  manner,  the  Nation %0aof  the  Marsi  continue  in  Italy,  who  preserve  the  Reputa- %0ation of  being  descended  from  a  Son  of  Circe,  and  therefore %0apossess  the  same  natural  faculty.  Yet  so  it  is  that  all  Men %0apossess  within  them  that  which  is  Poison  to  Serpents:  for %0ait  is  reported  they  flee  from  Man's  Spittle,  as  they  do  from %0athe  touch  of  Scalding  Water;  but  if  it  penetrate  into  their %0aMouth,  especially  if  it  come  from  a  Man  that  is  fasting,  it  is %0apresent  Death.  Beyond  the  Nasamonse,  and  their  Neigh- %0abours the  Machlyae,  there  are  Androgyni,  of  a  double  Nature, %0ainter  se  vicibus  coeuntes,  as  Calliphanes  reporteth.  Aristotle %0aadds,  that  their  Right  Breast  is  like  that  of  a  Man,  and  the %0aLeft  that  of  a  Woman.  In  the  same  Africa  Isigonus  and  Nym- %0aphodorus  avouch  that  there  are  certain  Families  of  Charmers: %0awho,  if  they  praise,  destroy  the  Sheep,  cause  .the  Trees  to %0awither,  and  Infants  to  pine  away  to  death.  Isigonus  addeth %0afurther,  that  there  are  People  of  the  same  kind  among  the  Tri- %0aballi  and  Illyrii,  who  charrn  with  their  Eyesight,  and  kill  those %0awhom  they  look  upon  for  a  long  time,  especially  if  their  Eyes %0alook  angry  :  which  Evil  of  theirs  is  more  quickly  felt  by  those %0awho  are  above  the  age  of  Puberty.

Not  far  from  the  City %0aof  Rome,  within  the  Territory  of  the  Falisci,  there  are  a  few %0aFamilies  called  Hirpise,  which  at  their  Yearly  Sacrifice  cele- %0abrated to  Apollo  upon  the  Mount  Soracte,  walk  upon  the %0apile  of  Wood  as  it  is  on  Fire  without  being  burnt.2  On %0awhich  account,  by  a  perpetual  Act  of  the  Senate,  they  possess %0aan  Immunity  from  War  and  all  other  Public  Services. %0aSome  men  have  certain  Parts  of  their  Bodies  naturally %0aworking  surprising  Effects.

And  there  are %0aTrees  growing  in  that  Country  to  such  a  Height,  that  a %0aMan  cannot  shoot  an  Arrow  over  them.  The  reason  of  this %0ais  the  Goodness  of  the  Soil,  the  Temperature  of  the  Air,  and %0athe  Abundance  of  Water :  which  is  the  cause  also  that  under %0aa  single  Fig-tree,2  if  it  can  be  believed,  Squadrons  of  Horse- %0amen may  stand.  There  are  Reeds  also  of  such  Length3  that %0abetween  every  Joint  they  will  yield  sufficient  to  make  Boats %0aable  to  receive  three  Men.  There  are  many  Men  there  who %0aare  above  five  Cubits  in  Height :  never  do  they  Spit :  they %0aare  not  troubled  with  Pain  in  the  Head,  Toothache,  or  any %0aDisease  of  the  Eyes,  and  seldom  of  any  other  Parts  of  the %0aBody;  so  hardy  are  they  through  the  Moderate  Heat  of  the %0aSun.  There  are  certain  Philosophers,  whom  they  call  Gym- %0anosophistae,4  who  from  Sunrising  to  its  setting  persevere  in %0astanding  and  looking  full  against  the  Sun  without  once %0a%0aof  teeth.  It  was  believed  that  he  cured  the  swelling  of  the  spleen,  by %0asacrificing  a  white  cock,  and  with  his  right  foot  gently  pressing  the  part %0aaffected,  the  patients  lying  on  their  backs  for  that  purpose.  There  was %0ano  person,  however  poor  or  mean,  to  whom  he  refused  this  relief,  if %0arequested.  He  received  no  reward,  except  the  cock  for  sacrifice ;  and  this %0apresent  was  very  agreeable  to  him.  It  is  also  said  that  the  great  toe  of %0athat  foot  had  a  divine  virtue  in  it ;  for,  after  his  death,  when  the  rest  of %0ahis  body  was  consumed,  that  toe  was  found  entire  and  untouched  by  the %0aflames." — LANGHORNE.

AlcippZ  was  delivered  of  an  Elephant,  and  that %0acertainly  was  a  monstrous  Token.  Also  in  the  beginning  of %0athe  Marsian  War  a  Bondwoman  brought  forth  a  Serpent.1 %0a%0a1  We  know  how  prone  vulgar  ignorance  or  superstition  is  to  compare %0aan  ordinary  monstrous  birth  to  some  fancied  animal.  Such  is  within  the %0aknowledge  of  living  observers.  But  what  shall  we  say  to  the  following  ? %0a"  Lemnius  tells  us  of  a  monster,  that  a  certain  woman  was  delivered  of, %0aand  to  whom  he  himself  was  physician  and  present  at  the  sight,  which  at %0athe  appearing  of  the  day  filled  all  the  chamber  with  roaring  and  crying, %0arunning  all  about  to  find  some  hole  to  creep  into-;  but  the  women  at  the %0alength  stifled  and  smothered  it  with  pillows." —  Wanleys  Wonders  of  the %0aLittle  World.  And  from  the  same  authority : — "  Johannes  Naborowsky, %0aa  noble  Polonian,  and  my  great  friend,  (says  Bartholini,  "Hist.  Anat.") %0atold  me  at  Basil,  that  he  had  seen  in  his  country  two  little  fishes  without %0ascales,  which  were  brought  forth  by  a  woman,  and  as  soon  as  they  came %0aout  of  her  womb  did  swim  in  the  water  as  other  fish."  The  story  given %0aby  Wormius,  concerning  the  birth  of  an  egg  from  a  woman  (and  of  which %0ahe  gives  a  figure  in  his  "  Museum  Wormianum,")  is  illustrated,  and  per- %0ahaps explained,  as  may  all  the  others  on  the  same  principle,  by  another %0agiven  in  Wanley's  book,  of  a  woman  "  of  good  quality,  who  had  made %0agreat  preparations  for  her  lying-in,  but  in  the  last  month  her  distension %0asubsided,  and  it  is  confessed  that  she  plumped  herself  up  with  a  stuffing  of %0agarments.  However,  the  time  must  come  at  last,  and  she  was  delivered %0aof  a  creature,  very  like  unto  a  dormouse  of  the  greater  size,  which  to  the %0aamazement  of  the  women  who  were  present,  with  marvellous  celerity %0asought  out  and  found  a  hole  in  the  chamber,  into  which  it  crept  and  was %0anever  seen  after."  Instances  somewhat  similar  have  occurred  in  very %0a%0a%0aBOOK  VII.]  History  of  Nature.  189 %0a%0aMany  misshapen  Creatures  of  various  kinds  are  produced  as %0aMonsters  in  the  World.

Among %0athe  Instances  there  is  one  of  a  Child  in  Saguntum,  in  the  Year %0ain  which  that  Town  was  destroyed  by  Annibal,  which,  as  soon %0aas  it  was  born,  presently  returned  again  into  the  Womb. %0a%0aCHAPTER  IV. %0aOf  the  Change  of  the  Sex  ;l  and  of  Double  Births. %0a%0aIT  is  no  fable,  that  Females  may  be  turned  to  Males ; %0afor  we  have  found  it  recorded  in  the  Annals,  that  in  the  Year %0awhen  Pub.  Licinius  Crassus  and  C.  Cassius  Longinus  were %0aConsuls,  there  was  at  Cassinum  a  Maid  who,  under  her %0aParents,  became  a  Boy :  and  by  the  order  of  the  Aruspices %0ahe  was  conveyed  to  a  Desert  Island.  Lucinius  Mutianus  re- %0aporteth,  that  himself  saw  at  Argos  a  Person  named  Arescon, %0awho  had  borne  the  Name  of  Arescusa,  and  even  had  been %0aMarried  :  but  afterwards  came  to  have  a  Beard,  and  the %0ageneral  Properties  of  a  Man,  and  thereupon  married  a  Wife. %0aAfter  the  same  sort  he  saw  at  Smyrna  a  Boy  changed.  I %0amyself  was  an  Eye-witness,  that  in  Africa  L.  Cossicius,  a %0a%0arecent  times,  to  the  great  disappointment  of  expecting  friends  :  and  the %0alaugh  could  only  have  been  rendered  the  louder  if,  instead  of  a  simple  dis- %0aappointment, an  egg  or  dormouse,  an  elephant  or  serpent  had  been  the %0aresult.  By  law,  "  Ut  monstrosos  partus  necare  parentibus  liceret," —  that %0a"  it  should  be  lawful  to  parents  to  put  to  death  children  that  were  born %0amonstrous;"  but  Dionysius  Halicarnasseus  adds,  that  it  was  necessary %0athey  should  call  witnesses  to  prove  that  they  were  monstrous :  although %0athe  latter  stipulation  can  scarcely  be  reconciled  with  another  law,  which %0agave  to  parents  the  right  of  life  and  death  over  their  children.  Accord- %0aing to  the  law  of  Tullus  Hostilius,  third  king  of  Rome,  when  three  chil- %0adren were  born  at  one  birth,  they  were  to  be  brought  up  to  the  age  of %0amaturity  at  the  public  charge. —  Wern.

Some  Women  bring  all  their %0aChildren  like  themselves ;  others  again  resembling  their %0aHusbands,  and  some  like  neither  the  one  nor  the  other. %0aSome  Women  bring  all  their  Daughters  like  their  Fathers, %0aand  their  Sons  like  the  Mothers.  The  Example  is  undoubted, %0aof  NiccBus^  a  famous  Painter  of  Byzantium,  who  having  to %0ahis  Mother  a  Woman  begotten  in  Adultery  by  an  Ethiopian, %0aand  nothing  different  in  Colour  from  other  Women,  was %0ahimself  begotten  an  Ethiopian.  Indeed,  the  Consideration %0aof  the  Likenesses  is  in  the  Mind ;  in  which  likewise  many %0aother  Accidents  are  thought  to  be  very  strong,  whether  they %0acome  by  Sight,  Hearing,  and  Memory,  or  Imaginations %0adrunk  in  in  the  very  instant  of  Conception.1  The  thought  of %0aeither  Father  or  Mother  flying  to  and  fro  transporting  the %0aSoul  in  a  moment,  is  supposed  to  stamp  this  Likeness,  or  to %0amix  it.  On  this  account  it  is  that  Men  are  more  unlike  one %0aanother  than  other  Creatures:  for  the  Quickness  of  the %0aThoughts,  the  Agility  of  the  Mind,  the  very  great  variety %0aof  our  Dispositions,  imprint  the  great  Multiplicity  of  Marks  ; %0awhereas  the  Minds  of  other  Creatures  is  immovable,  being %0aalike  in  all,  and  in  every  one  according  to  its  own  Kind. %0aArtenon,  a  Man  of  the  common  Rank,  was  so  like  in  all %0apoints  to  Antiochus  King  of  Syria,  that  Laodicl  the  Queen, %0aafter  Antiochus  was  killed,  effected  the  Succession  of  the %0aKingdom  through  his  acting  the  part  of  Recommendation. %0aVibius,  a  certain  Commoner  of  Rome,  and  Publicius,  one %0afrom  a  Bondslave  made  a  Freeman,  were  both  of  them  so %0alike  Pompey  the  Great,  that  the  one  could  scarcely  be %0adiscerned  from  the  other :  so  closely  did  they  represent  that %0aopen  Countenance,  and  the  singular  Majesty  which  appeared %0ain  his  Forehead.

So  was  one %0aof  the  Scipios  surnamed  Serapio  upon  such  an  occasion, %0aafter  the  name  of  one  Serapio,  who  was  a  base  Slave  of  his, %0aand  the  dealer  in  buying  and  selling  his  Swine.  Another %0aScipio  after  him,  of  the  same  House,  was  surnamed  Salutio, %0abecause  of  a  certain  Jester  of  that  Name.  After  the  same %0amanner  one  Spinter,  a  Player  of  the  second  Place,1  arid %0aPamphilus,  a  Player  of  the  third  Part,  resembled  Lentulus %0aand  Metellus,  who  were  Consuls  together.  And  this  fell %0aout  very  untowardly,  that  such  resemblances  of  the  two %0aConsuls  should  be  seen  together  on  the  Stage.  On  the  other %0ahand,  Rubrius  the  Player  was  surnamed  Plancus,  because %0ahe  was  so  like  Plancus  the  Orator.  Again,  Burbuleius  and %0aMenogenes,  both  Players,  gave  name,  the  one  to  Curio  the %0aFather,  as  did  the  other  to  Messala  Censorius.

Cassius  Severus,  the  famous  Orator,  was %0areproached  for  being  like  Mirmillo,  a  Keeper  of  Cattle. %0aToranius  sold  to  Marcus  Antonius,  at  that  time  Triumvir, %0atwo  very  beautiful  Boys  as  Twins,  so  like  they  were  one  to %0athe  other :  although  one  was  born  in  Asia,  and  the  other %0abeyond  the  Alps.  But  when  Antony  afterwards  came  to %0athe  knowledge  of  the  fraud,  which  was  detected  by  the  Lan- %0aguage of  the  Boys,  he  threatened  him  in  great  Anger : %0aAmong  other  things  complaining  of  the  high  Price  that  he %0ahad  made  him  pay,  for  they  cost  him  two  hundred  Sesterces. %0aBut  the  cunning  Merchant  answered,  That  this  was  the  very %0acause  why  he  bad  sold  them  at  so  great  a  rate  :  for  it  would %0anot  have  been  so  wonderful  if  two  Brothers  of  the  same %0aMother  had  resembled  one  another ;  but  that  there  should %0abe  any  found,  who  were  born  in  different  Countries,  so  like %0ain  all  respects,  was  above  every  thing  deserving  of  a  high %0aPrice.

Cornelia,  the  Mother  of  the  Grac- %0achi, is  sufficient  proof  that  it  is  an  adverse  omen,  when %0aWomen  are  born  with  the  Genital  Parts  grown  together. %0aSome  Children  are  born  with  a  continued  edge  of  Bone %0ainstead  of  a  row  of  distinct  Teeth  j1  as  a  Son  of  Prusius  King %0aof  the  Bythinians,  who  had  such  a  Bone  in  his  Upper  Jaw. %0aBut  Teeth  are  the  only  parts  that  are  not  subdued  by  the %0aFires ;  so  that  they  are  not  consumed  with  the  rest  of  the %0aBody;  but  the  same  parts  that  are  not  conquered  by  the %0aFlames  are  hollowed  out  and  wasted  by  a  Waterish  Rheum. %0aThey  may  be  made  White  by  some  Medicines.  They  are %0aworn  away  by  use  ;  and  sometimes  they  fall  first  out  of  the %0aHead  ;  they  serve  not  only  to  grind  our  Meat  for  our  Nourish- %0ament, but  they  are  necessary  for  the  framing  of  our  Speech. %0aThe  Fore-teeth  hold  the  Government  over  our  Voice  and %0aWords  by  a  peculiar  accord,  answering  to  the  Stroke  of  the %0aTongue,  and  the  series  of  their  Formation,  with  their  Size, %0acatting  up,  softening,  or  restraining  the  Words ;  but  when %0athey  are  fallen  out  all  explanation  of  Words  is  lost. %0aMoreover,  it  may  be  believed,  that  some  Augury  can  be %0agathered  from  the  Teeth.  Men  are  in  possession  of  two-and- %0athirty  in  all,  except  the  Nation  of  the  Turduli ;  and  those %0awho  have  above  this  Number  suppose  that  they  may  calcu- %0alate on  longer  Life.  Women  have  not  so  many :  they  that %0ahave  on  the  right  Side  in  the  upper  Jaw  two  Eye-teeth, %0anamed  Canine,  may  promise  themselves  the  Favours  of  For- %0atune ;  as  was  the  case  in  Agrippina,  the  Mother  of  Domitius %0aNero :  but  it  is  the  contrary  in  the  Left  Side.  It  is  not  the  Cus- %0atom in  any  Country  to  burn  in  a  Funeral  Fire  the  dead  Body %0aof  an  Infant  before  the  Teeth  are  come  up :  but  of  this  we  will %0awrite  more,  when  our  History  will  take  in  the  individual %0aMembers.

This  also  is  observed  for  a  Truth,  that %0agenerally  all  Men  fall  short  of  the  full  Stature  in  Times  past ; %0aand  seldom  are  they  taller  than  their  Fathers :  the  Exube- %0arance of  the  Seeds  being  consumed  by  the  burning,  in  the %0aChanges  of  which  the  World  now  vergeth  toward  the  latter %0aEnd.     In  Crete,  a  Mountain  being  cloven  asunder  by  an %0aEarthquake,  a  Body  was  found  standing,  forty-six  Cubits %0ahigh ;   which  some  judged  to  be  the  Body  of  Orion,  and %0aothers,  of  Otus.     It  is  believed  from  Records  that  the  Body %0aof  Orestes,  when  taken  up  by  direction  of  the  Oracle,  was %0aseven  Cubits  long.1     And  that  great  Poet,  Homer,  who  lived %0aalmost  a  thousand  Years  ago,  did  not  cease  to  complain  that %0aMen's  Bodies  were  less  of  Stature  even  then,  than  in  old %0aTime.     The  Annals  do  not  deliver  down  the  Bulk  of  Navius %0aPollio;  but  that  he  was  of  great  size  appeareth  by  this,  that %0ait  was  taken  for  a  Wonder,  that  in  a  great  Crowd  of  People %0arunning  together  he  was  almost  killed.     The  tallest  Man %0athat  hath  been  seen  in  our  Age  was  one  named  Gabbara, %0awho  in  the  Days  of  Prince  Claudius  was  brought  out  of %0aArabia;  he  was  nine  Feet  high,  and  as  many  Inches.    There %0awere  in  the  Time  of  Divus  Augustus  two   others,  named %0aPusio  and  Secundilla,  higher  than  Gabbara  by  half  a  Foot, %0awhose  Bodies  were  preserved  for  a  Wonder  in  a  Vault  in  the %0aGardens  of  the  Salustiani.     While  the  same  (Augustus)  was %0aPresident,  his  Niece  Julia  had  a  very  little  Man,  two  Feet %0aand  a  Hand- breadth  high,  called  Canopas,  whom  she  made %0amuch  of;  and  also  a  Woman  named  Andromeda,*  the  Freed %0aWoman  of  Julia  Augusta.

He  maketh  mention %0aalso  of  a  Son  of  his,  a  Soldier  under  Pompey  the  Great ;  and %0athat  he  had  all  over  his  Body,  as  well  as  through  his  Arms %0aand  Hands,  Sinews  running  straight  and  across  like  Net- %0awork :  and  when  an  Enemy  challenged  him  to  a  Combat, %0ahe  overcame  him  with  his  right  Hand  unarmed,  and  in  the %0aEnd  caught  hold  of  him,  and  brought  him  into  the  Camp %0awith  one  Finger.  Junius  Valens,  a  Centurion  in  the  Praeto- %0arium  of  Divus  Augustus,  was  accustomed  to  bear  up  Waggons %0aladen  with  Sacks,  until  they  were  discharged :  with  one  Hand %0ahe  would  hold  back  a  Chariot,  standing  firm  against  all  the %0aForce  of  the  Horses.

When  Milo,  the  great %0aWrestler  of  Croton£,  stood  firm  upon  his  Feet,  no  Man  was %0aable  to  make  him  stir  in  the  least  Degree :  if  he  held  an %0aApple,  no  Man  was  able  to  stretch  out  his  Finger.1  It  was  a %0agreat  matter,  that  Philippides  ran  1140  Stadia,  from  Athens %0ato  Lacedsemon,  in  two  Days  ;  until  Anistis,  a  Runner  of %0aLacedsemon,  and  Philonides,  belonging  to  Alexander  the %0aGreat,  ran  from  Sicyone  to  Elis  in  one  Day,  1200  Stadia. %0aBut  now,  indeed,  we  know  some  in  the  Circus  able  to  endure %0athe  running  of  160  Miles.

And  a  Man  may %0awonder  the  more  at  this  Matter,  if  he  consider,  that  it  was %0acounted  an  exceeding  great  Journey  that  Tiberius  Nero  made %0ain  three  Chariots  in  a  Day  and  a  Night,  when  he  hasted  to %0ahis  Brother  Drusus,  then  lying  sick  in  Germany,  which  was %0abut  200  Miles.2 %0a%0a1  Two  persons,  successively  porters  to  Kings  James  I.  and  Charles, %0ahis  son,  were  of  great  size  and  strength.    The  first,  particularly,  was  able %0ato  take  two  of  the  tallest  yeomen  of  the  guard,  one  under  each  arm,  and %0ahe  ordered  them  as  he  pleased.

Cicero  hath  recorded,  that  the  Poem %0aof  Homer  called  the  Iliad,  written  on  Parchment,  was  en- %0aclosed within  a  Nutshell.  The  same  Writer  maketh  mention %0aof  one  who  could  see  to  the  Distance  of  135  Miles.  And %0aM.Varro  nameth  the  Man,  saying  that  he  was  called  Strabo; %0aand  that  during  the  Carthaginian  War  he  was  accustomed  to %0astand  upon  Lilybseum,  a  Promontory  of  Sicily,  and  discover %0athe  Fleet  coming  out  of  the  Harbour  of  Carthage ;  he  was %0aalso  able  to  tell  even  the  Number  of  the  Ships.  Collier ates %0amade  Emmets,  and  other  equally  small  Creatures,  out  of %0aIvory,  so  that  other  Men  could  not  discern  the  Parts  of  their %0aBodies.  A  certain  Myrmecides  was  excellent  in  that  kind  of %0aWorkmanship ;  who  of  the  same  Material  carved  a  Chariot %0awith  four  Wheels,  which  a  Fly  might  cover  with  her  Wings. %0aAlso  he  made  a  Ship  that  a  little  Bee  might  hide  with  her %0aWings.1 %0a%0aCHAPTER  XXII. %0aOf  Hearing. %0a%0aOF  Hearing  there  is  one  Example  which  is  wonderful : %0athat  the  Battle  in  which  Sybaris  was  destroyed  was  heard  at %0aOlympia  on  the  very  same  Day  it  was  fought.  For  the  Cim- %0a%0a1  Peculiarities  of  eyesight  are  also  recorded  in  ancient  authors.  The %0aEmperor  Tiberius  was  able  to  see  better  than  other  men  by  night ;  and %0acontrary  to  the  usual  habit,  best  when  he  first  opened  his  eyes  from  sleep. %0aSuch  was  also  the  case  with  the  philosopher  Cardan.  Fabricius  ab  Aqua- %0apendente  knew  a  man  who  could  see  well  by  night,  but  not  by  day ;  and %0athe  Editor  was  acquainted  with  two  brothers,  whose  vision  was  of  this %0akind ;  and  it  may  be  accounted  for  by  the  fact,  that  they  were  destitute  of %0aeyebrows,  and  had  very  little  eyelashes. —  Wern.

The  most  illustrious  among  Women  is %0athe  Example  of  Leana  the  Courtesan,  who,  when  she  was %0atortured,  did  not  betray  Harmodius  and  Aristogiton,  who %0aslew  the  Tyrant.  Among  Men  is  the  Example  of  Anaxar- %0achus,  who,  being  tortured  for  a  like  Cause,  bit  off  his  Tongue %0awith  his  Teeth,  and  spat  his  only  Hope  of  Discovery  into  the %0aFace  of  the  Tyrant. %0a%0aCHAPTER  XXIV. %0aExamples  of  Memory.1 %0a%0aMEMORY  is  the  greatest  Gift  of  Nature,  and  most  neces- %0asary of  all  others  for  Life  ;  it  is  hard  to  say  who  deserved  the %0a%0a1  The  orator  Hortensius  was  famous  for  an  extensive  and  accurate %0amemory ;  which  Cicero  speaks  of  with  admiration.  It  is  said  of  him, %0athat  once  sitting  at  a  place  where  things  were  exposed  to  public  sale  for  a %0awhole  day,  he  recited  in  order  all  the  things  that  had  been  sold,  their %0aprice,  and  the  names  of  the  buyers ;  and  it  was  afterwards  found  that  he %0awas  minutely  correct.  Cicero,  comparing  him  with  Lucullus,  says,  that %0aHortensius's  memory  was  greater  for  words,  and  that  of  Lucullus  for %0athings, — an  important  distinction,  for  it  is  commonly  found  that  those  who %0abest  remember  the  one,  are  deficient  in  the  other.  Seneca  had  a  remark- %0aable memory  for  words ;  so  that  he  was  able  to  repeat  two  thousand  names %0ain  the  order  they  were  pronounced.  The  art  of  memory,  to  which  some %0amoderns  have  made  great  pretensions,  is  very  ancient ;  and  it  was  much %0ain  use  in  the  middle  ages.  But  it  applies  to  words  rather  than  things  ; %0aand  it  requires  to  be  studied  as  an  individual  object,  and  not  as  means  to %0aan  end.— Wern.

Cineas,  Ambassador  of  King  Pyrrhus, %0athe  next  Day  after  he  came  to  Rome,  saluted  by  Name  the %0aSenate  and  Equestrian  Order.  Mithridates,  the  King  of  two- %0aand-twenty  Nations  of  different  Languages,  ministered  Justice %0ato  them  in  that  Number  of  Tongues :  and  when  he  made  a %0aSpeech  in  the  public  Assembly  respectively  to  every  Nation,  he %0aperformed  it  without  an  Interpreter.  A  certain  Charmidas^ %0aa  Grecian,  rehearsed  as  if  he  was  reading  whatever  any  Man %0awould  call  for  out  of  any  of  the  Volumes  in  the  Libraries. %0aAt  length  the  Practice  of  this  was  reduced  into  an  Art  of %0aMemory,  which  was  invented  by  Simonides  Melicus,  and %0aafterwards  brought  to  Perfection  by  Metrodorus  Scepsius;  by %0awhich  a  Man  might  learn  to  rehearse  the  same  Words  of  any %0aDiscourse  after  once  hearing.  And  yet  there  is  nothing  in %0aMan  so  frail ;  for  it  is  injured  by  Diseases,  Accidents,  and  by %0aFear,  sometimes  in  part,  and  at  other  Times  entirely.

We  are  told  that  Curio,  the  orator,  was  much  given  to %0athis ;  so  that,  offering  to  divide  a  subject  into  three  heads,  he  would  forget %0aone  of  them,  or  perhaps  make  four.   He  was  to  plead  on  behalf  of  Sextus %0aNaevius,  opposed  to  Cicero,  who  was  on  the  side  of  Titania  Corta ;  when %0ahe  suddenly  forgot  the  whole  cause,  and  ascribed  the  fact  to  the  witchcraft %0aof  Titania.  —  Wern.

I  speak  not  now  of  his  Courage %0aand  Constancy,  nor  of  his  lofty  Understanding  of  all  Things %0aunder  the  Expanse  of  Heaven  ;  but  of  that  proper  Strength %0aand  Quickness  of  his,  as  active  as  the  very  Fire.  We  have %0aheard  it  reported  of  him,  that  he  was  accustomed  to  write %0aand  read  at  one  Time,  to  dictate  and  hear.  He  would  dic- %0atate Letters  of  the  utmost  Importance  to  four  Secretaries  at %0aonce :  and  when  he  was  free  from  other  Business,  he  would %0adictate  seven  Letters  at  one  Time.  The  same  Man  fought %0afifty  Battles  with  Banners  displayed :  in  which  Point  he %0aalone  exceeded  M.  Marcellus,  who  fought  thirty-nine  Battles. %0aFor,  besides  his  Victories  in  the  Civil  Wars,  he  slew  in  Battle %0a1,192,000  of  his  Enemies  ;  but  this,  for  my  own  Part,  I  hold %0ano  special  Glory  of  his,  considering  the  great  Injury  so  in- %0aflicted on  Mankind  :  and  this,  indeed,  he  hath  himself  con- %0afessed, by  avoiding  to  set  down  the  Slaughter  that  occurred %0aduring  the  Civil  Wars.

But  herein %0aappeared  the  true  and  incomparable  Loftiness  of  his  un- %0aconquered  Mind,  that  when  at  the  Battle  of  Pharsalia,  the %0aWriting-case  containing  the  Letters  of  Pompey  was  taken, %0aas  also  those  of  Scipio  at  Thapsus,  he  burnt  them  all  with %0athe  utmost  Fidelity,  without  having  read  them. %0a%0a%0aPompey. %0a%0aCHAPTER  XXVI. %0aThe  Praise  of  Pompey  the  Great. %0a%0aTo  relate  all  the  Titles,  Victories,  and  Triumphs  of  Pompey %0athe  Great,  wherein  he  was  equal  in  the  splendour  of  his %0aExploits  not  only  to  Alexander  the  Great,1  but  even  almost %0ato  Hercules  and  Liber  Pater,  would  redound,  not  to  the %0aHonour  only  of  that  one  Man,  but  also  to  the  Grandeur  of %0athe  Roman  Empire.

It  was  per- %0ahaps to  humour  this  foible,  and  through  it  to  secure  him  the  more  effec- %0atually  to  his  party,  that  Sylla  was  accustomed  to  pay  him  extraordinary %0apersonal  honours :  returning  his  salutation  of  Imperator  with  the  same %0atitle,  rising  from  his  seat  to  salute  him  when  Pompey  dismounted  from %0ahis  horse,  and  uncovering  his  head  at  the  same  time. — Daleschampiiis. %0aIn  honour  of  Pompey 's  having  restored  the  sovereignty  of  the  sea,  the %0areverse  of  a  Roman  denarius  bears  the  figure  of  a  Dolphin  and  Eagle, %0aseparated  by  a  Sceptre,  with  the  inscription,  Magn.

Immediately  passing  into  the %0aWest,  and  having  brought  under  obedience  876  Towns, %0abetween  the  Alps  and  the  borders  of  Spain,  he  erected %0aTrophies  on  the  Pyrenees,  with  the  inscription  of  his  Victory  ; %0aand  with  more  nobleness  of  Mind,  said  nothing  concerning %0aSertorius.  And  after  the  Civil  War  was  put  an  end  to %0a(which  drew  after  it  all  Foreign  matters),  this  Roman  Knight %0atriumphed  the  second  time :  being  so  many  times  a  General %0a(Imperator),  before  he  was  a  Soldier  (Miles).

But  Cato,1  the  First  of  the  Porcian  House, %0awas  thought  to  have  been  the  most  excellent  in  three %0athings  which  are  in  the  highest  degree  commendable  in %0aMan.  He  was  the  best  Orator;  the  best  General ;  and  the %0abest  Senator.  And  yet,  in  my  opinion,  all  these  excellencies %0ashone  out  more  brightly,  although  he  was  not  first,  in  Scipio %0aJEmilianus :  To  say  nothing  besides  of  the  absence  of  the %0aHatred  of  so  many  Men,  which  Cato  laboured  under.  But %0aif  you  seek  for  one  especial  thing  in  Cato,  this  is,  that  he %0awas  judicially  called  to  his  answer  Forty-four  times,  and %0anever  was  there  a  Man  accused  oftener  than  he ;  yet  he  was %0aalways  acquitted. %0a%0aCHAPTER  XXVIII. %0a%0aOf  Valour. %0aIT  is  a  very  extensive  inquiry,  to  discover  in  whom  the %0a%0a1  This  Cato  appears  to  have  been  more  successful  in  obtaining  the %0aesteem  than  the  love  of  the  people ;  and,  indeed,  from  the  evidence  of  his %0a"Treatise  on  Agriculture,"  he  appears  to  have  been  a  niggardly  and %0ashrewd  master,  whom  no  one  could  defraud,  and  who  was  ready  to %0asecure  every  advantage  in  a  bargain.  He  recommends,  with  the  same %0aindifference,  the  sale  of  an  ox  that  was  past  labour,  his  rusty  iron,  and %0asickly  or  worn-out  slave. %0a%0aNarratur  et  prisci  Catonis, %0a%0aSaepe  mero  caluisse  Virtus. — Wern.

Becoming  afterwards  a  warm  supporter  of  the  popular %0aparty  against  the  patrician  order,  he  was  accused  of  aiming  at  the  kingly %0apower,  and  condemned  to  death.  According  to  Livy  (lib.  vi.)  "the %0atribunes  cast  him  down  from  the  Tarpeian  rock ;  thus  the  same  spot,  in %0athe  case  of  one  man,  became  a  monument  of  distinguished  glory  and  of %0athe  cruellest  punishment." —  Wern.

Above  all  other  actions,  he  alone  saved  the %0aCapitol,  and  thereby  the  whole  State,  from  the  Gauls:  if  he %0ahad  not  saved  it  for  his  own  Kingdom  !  In  these  examples %0athere  is  indeed  much  of  courage,  but  yet  Fortune  hath  had  the %0agreater  share ;  and  in  my  judgment  no  one  may  justly  prefer %0aany  Man  before  M.

In  the  second  Year  of  his  Service %0ahe  lost  his  Right  Hand  ;  and  in  two  Services  he  was  wounded %0athree  and  twenty  times :  by  which  means  he  had  little  use %0aof  either  his  Hands  or  Feet.  But  although  thus  disabled %0aas  a  Soldier,  he  went  many  a  Time  after  to  the  Wars, %0aattended  only  by  one  Slave.  Twice  he  was  taken  Prisoner %0aby  Hannibal  (for  he  did  not  serve  against  ordinary  Enemies), %0aand  twice  he  escaped  from  his  bonds,  although  for  twenty %0aMonths  he  was  every  Day  kept  Bound  with  Chains  or %0aShackles.  Four  times  he  fought  with  his  Left  Hand  only, %0auntil  two  Horses  were  killed  under  him.  He  made  himself %0aa  Right  Hand  of  Iron,  and  he  fought  with  it  fastened  to  his %0aArm.  He  delivered  Cremona  from  Siege,  and  saved  Pla- %0acentia.  In  Gallia,  he  took  twelve  Camps  of  the  Enemies: %0aAll  which  Exploits  appear  from  that  Oration  of  his  which  he %0amade  in  his  Praetorship,  when  his  Colleagues  repelled  him %0afrom  the  solemn  Sacrifices  because  he  was  maimed.1  What %0aheaps  of  Crowns  would  he  have  built  up  if  he  had  been %0amatched  with  any  other  Enemy  !

For  what  Civic  Crowns  yielded  either  Trebia %0aand  Ticinus,  or  Thrasymenus?  what  Crown  could  have  been %0agained  at  Cannae,  where  the  best  service  of  Courage  was  to %0ahave  made  an  escape  ?  Others,  truly,  have  vanquished  Men  ; %0abut  Sergius  conquered  Fortune  herself. %0a%0a1  The  ancients  were  cautious  not  to  admit  a  mutilated  person  to  the %0acelebration  of  sacred  rites,  observing  that  such  a  defect  was  to  be  regarded %0aas  a  thing  of  ill-omen  ;  and  that,  if  the  victim  must  be  perfect,  how  much %0amore  does  it  become  the  priest  to  be  so !

Unless  perhaps %0awe  agree  that  Homer,  the  Greek  Prophet,  excelled  all  others, %0aconsidering  either  the  subject  matter  or  the  happy  fortune %0aof  his  Work.  And  therefore  Alexander  the  Great  (for  in  so %0aproud  a  decision  I  shall  cite  the  Judgment  of  the  highest, %0aand  of  those  that  are  beyond  Envy),  having  found  among %0athe  Spoils  of  Darius,  king  of  the  Persians,  his  Casket  of %0asweet  Ointments,  which  was  richly  embellished  with  Gold, %0aPearls,  and  precious  Stones  ;  when  his  friends  shewed  him %0amany  uses  to  which  the  Cabinet  might  be  put,  considering %0athat  Alexander,  as  a  Soldier  engaged  in  War,  and  soiled  with %0aits  service,  was  disgusted  with  those  Unguents  :  By  Hercules, %0ahe  said,  let  it  be  devoted  to  the  care  of  Homer's  Books,  that %0athe  most  precious  Work  of  the  Human  Mind  should  be  pre- %0aserved in  the  richest  of  all  Caskets.  The  same  Prince,  when %0ahe  took  Thebes,  commanded  that  the  Dwelling-house  and %0aFamily  of  the  Poet  Pindar*  should  be  spared.  He  refounded %0athe  native  place  (Patria)  of  Aristotle  the  Philosopher;  and %0aso  mingled  a  kind  Testimony  for  one  who  threw  light  on %0aall  things  in  the  World.

Isocrates  sold  one  Oration  for  twenty  talents  of  Gold. %0aJEschines,  the  famous  Orator  of  Athens,  having  at  Rhodes %0arehearsed  that  accusation  which  he  had  made  against %0aDemosthenes,  read  also  his  adversary's  defence,  by  occasion %0aof  which  he  had  been  driven  into  Banishment  at  Rhodes ; %0aand  when  the  Rhodians  wondered  at  it  he  said,  How  much %0amore  would  you  have  wondered,  if  you  had  heard  him  de- %0alivering it  himself!  Yielding  thus  in  his  Calamity  a  noble %0aTestimony  to  his  Adversary.  The  Athenians  exiled  Thucy- %0adides  their  General :  but  after  he  had  written  his  Chronicle %0athey  called  him  home  again,  wondering  at  the  Eloquence  of %0athe  Man  whose  Courage  they  had  condemned.  The  Kings %0aof  Egypt  and  Macedonia  gave  a  strong  Testimony  how  much %0athey  honoured  Mcenander  the  Comic  Poet,  in  that  they %0asent  Ambassadors  for  him  with  a  Fleet ;  but  he  won  himself %0agreater  fame  by  esteeming  more  his  Studies,  than  the  Favours %0aof  Princes.  Also  the  Roman  Nobles  have  afforded  Testi- %0amonies even  to  Foreigners.  Hence  Cn.  Pompey,  when  he  had %0aended  the  War  against  Mithridates,  being  about  to  enter  the %0aHouse  of  Posidonius,  the  celebrated  Professor  of  Wisdom, %0aforbad  the  Lictor  to  knock  at  the  Door  according  to  custom  : %0aand  he  to  whom  both  the  East  and  the  West  parts  of  the %0aWorld  had  submitted,  laid  down  the  lictorial  Fasces  at  the %0aGate.

It %0awas  not,  therefore,  the  fear  that  eloquence  would  render  the  Romans %0aeffeminate ;  but  because  the  peculiar  eloquence  of  these  men,  with  per- %0ahaps the  general  tendency  of  Greek  studies,  was  calculated  to  foster %0ahabits  of  sophistry,  and  so  confound  the  distinction  between  truth  and %0afalsehood.—  Wern.

"  It  was  well  known  from  a  passage %0ain  Cicero,  and  another  in  Livy,  that  the  sepulchre  of  the  Scipios  stood %0abeyond  the  Porta  Capena  of  Rome  ;  and  Livy  describes  it  as  being  in  his %0atime  surmounted  by  three  statues :  two  of  them  of  the  Scipios,  and  the %0athird,  as  was  believed,  of  the  poet  Ennius.     But  it  was  not  until  the  year %0aA.D.  1780,  that  some  labourers  at  work  in  a  vineyard  discovered  a  clue %0awhich  led  to  further  excavations;  and  thus  the  tombs,  after  having  lain %0aundisturbed  for  upwards  of  2000  years,  were  most  unexpectedly  brought %0ato  light.

Varro,  even  while  he  lived :  a  thing  of  as %0agreat  honour,  in  my  opinion  (considering  that  among  the %0amultitude  of  learned  Men  he  only  received  this  Crown  from  a %0aCitizen  and  an  excellent  Orator),  as  that  other  Naval  Crown %0agained  him,  which  Pompey  the  Great  bestowed  upon  him %0a%0aThus  interpreted : — %0a%0aHunc  umirn  plurimi  consentiunt  Romae, %0a%0aBonorum  optimum  fuisse  virum, %0a%0aLucium  Scipionem,  films  Barbati, %0a%0aConsol,  Censor,  .^Edilis,  Hie  fuit ;  atque  (or,  apud  vos, %0a%0aor  ad  eos). %0a%0aHie  cepit  Corsicam,  Aleriamque  urbem %0aDedit  Tempestatibus  sedem  merito. %0a%0a"  The  Roman  people  agree  in  thinking  this  man,  Lucius  Scipio,  the %0abest  of  all  good  citizens.

In  Grammar,  Apollodorus  was  distin- %0aguished; and  therefore  he  was  highly  honoured  by  the  Am- %0aphitryons  of  Greece.  In  Medicine,  Hippocrates1  excelled  ; %0aand  having  foretold  a  Pestilence  that  was  approaching  from %0aIllyria,  to  cure  it  he  sent  his  Disciples  to  the  surrounding %0aCities.

But  of  what  is  properly %0adenominated  science  they  knew  little ;  and  the  Chevalier  Bunsen  re- %0amarks, that  they  did  not  reverence  or  recognise  human  rights  in  any %0anation  beside  their  own.  The  love  of  knowledge  and  truth  for  their  own %0asakes  was  altogether  unknown  among  them,  and  they  never  conferred %0abenefit  except  for  their  own  advantage.  Their  calculating  self-love  made %0athem,  essentially,  beneficial  rulers ;  but  they  manifested  no  esteem  for  their %0asubjects ;  and  we  may  add,  that  the  most  probable  motive  which  actuated %0aPlutarch  in  writing  his  "  Lives,"  and  especially  for  arranging  them  in %0aparallels,  was  to  shew  covertly  that  men,  as  great  in  all  respects  as  any %0aRomans,  had  lived  in  Greece.  Germanicus  is  judged  to  have  been  an %0aexception  to  this  Roman  constitution  of  mind ;  and  probably  there  were %0aothers  of  lower  rank ;  but  they  are  to  be  regarded  as  simply  the  exceptions %0a%0a%0aBOOK  VII.]  History  of  Nature.  225 %0a%0atheir  highest  Advantage  in  one  Thing,  others  in  another;1 %0aand  every  one  rneasureth  it  according  to  his  several  Dispo- %0asition :  but  if  we  wish  to  form  a  correct  Judgment,  throwing %0aaside  all  the  Ambition  of  Fortune,  it  may  be  concluded,  that %0athere  is  not  a  Man  in  the  World  to  be  accounted  happy.  Arid, %0atherefore,  Fortune  dealeth  liberally  and  indulgently  with  any %0aone,  if  he  may  justly  be  called  not  unhappy  ;  because  if  there %0abe  no  other  Things,  yet  surely  a  Man  may  be  ever  in  Fear %0alest  Fortune  should  grow  tired  of  him  :  but  let  him  admit %0athis  Fear,  and  there  can  be  no  solid  Happiness.  What %0ashould  I  say,  moreover,  to  this  ?  —  that  no  Man  is  at  all  Times %0awise?  I  wish  that  this  were  false,  and  not,  in  the  Judgment %0aof  most  Men,  a  Poet's  Word  only.  But  such  is  the  Folly  of %0amortal  Men,  that  they  are  very  ingenious  in  deceiving  them- %0aselves :  so  that  they  reckon  after  the  Custom  of  the  Thra- %0acians,  who,  by  Stones  marked  with  different  Colours,  which %0athey  cast  into  an  Urn,  institute  the  Trial  of  every  Day  ;  and %0aat  their  last  Day  they  separate  these  Stones  one  from  an- %0aother and  count  them  :  and  thus  give  Judgment  concerning %0a%0ato  the  general  rule.     It  is  in  the  spirit  of  Pliny's  remark  that  Martial %0abegins  his  Epigram  to  Trajan,  lib.  xii.  ep.  8  :  — %0a%0a"  Terrarum  Dea,  gentiumque  Roma, %0aCui  par  est  nihil,  et  nihil  secundum." %0a%0aGoddess  of  lands  and  nations,  Rome, %0a%0aNothing  to  which  can  equal  come, %0a%0aAnd  nothing  second.

The  result  was  the  same  as  is  expressed %0aby  Pliny,  but  with  the  advantage  on  the  side  of  the  Hebrew  sage,  that %0ahe  was  able  to  find  in  his  more  elevated  principles  a  security  of  which %0aPliny  was  altogether  ignorant.  The  value  of  the  Life  and  Immortality %0awhich  have  been  brought  to  light  by  the  Gospel,  can  best  be  estimated %0awhen  we  see  the  gloom  which  occupied  the  mind  of  even  such  a  man  as %0aPliny  without  it.

FIDUSTIUS,  a  Senator,  having  been  Proscribed  by %0aSylla,  was  preserved  for  six-and-thirty  Years;  but  he  was %0aafterwards  Proscribed  the  second  time :  for  he  outlived  Sylla %0aand  continued  to  the  time  of  Antony ;  and  it  so  happened %0athat  by  him  he  was  Proscribed  again,  for  no  other  reason %0abut  because  he  had  been  so  before.  Fortune  was  pleased %0athat  P.  Ventidius  alone  should  triumph  over  the  Parthians  : %0abut  she  had  led  him,  while  a  Boy,  in  the  Asculan  triumph  of %0aCn.  Pompeius  Strabo  ;  although  Massurius  testifieth,  that  he %0awas  so  led  in  triumph  twice.  Cicero  saith,1  that  he  was  at %0afirst  but  a  Muleteer  to  serve  the  Camp  with  Meal.  Many %0aothers  affirm  that  in  his  Youth  he  was  a  poor  Soldier,  and %0aserved  as  a  Footman  in  his  Caliga  (or  Military  Foot  Clothing). %0aBalbus  Cornelius  was  also  the  Senior  Consul  :  but  he  had %0abeen  judicially  accused,  delivered  over  to  the  Counsel  of  the %0aJudges,  so  that  the  right  of  the  Rods2  was  on  him.  But  this %0aMan  was  the  first  Roman  Consul  of  Foreigners,  arid  even  of %0athose  born  within  the  Ocean ;  having  attained  to  that  Dig- %0anity, which  our  Forefathers  denied  to  Latium.  Among  the  dis- %0atinguished is  L.  Fulvius,  who  was  Consul  of  the  rebellious  Tus- %0aculans  ;  but  when  he  had  passed  over  to  the  Romans,  he  was %0apresently  by  the  whole  People  advanced  to  the  same  Honour %0aamong  them :  and  he  was  the  only  Man  who  triumphed  at %0a%0a1  Epist.  x.  18. %0a%0a2  This  "right"  was  according  to  a  law  whose  origin  is  disputed;  but %0ait  seems  to  have  been  ancient.    According  to  Dalechampius'  note  on  the %0apassage,  no  Roman  citizen  could  be  sentenced  by  the  magistrate  to  the %0arods,  or  be  put  to  death,  for  any  other  crime  than  murder;  and  of %0athe  latter  it  was  necessary  that  he  should  be  regularly  convicted.     But  it %0awould  appear  that  he  might  be  condemned  to  exile  with  little  ceremony. %0aBefore  the  passing  of  this  law,  a  Roman  citizen,  as  well  as  a  foreigner,  if %0asentenced  to  death,  was  scourged  as  a  matter  of  course  previous  to  the %0aexecution  of  the  higher  sentence.     The  tendency  of  this  law  to  confer %0aprotection  is  seen  in  the  instance  of  St.  Paul,  Acts  of  the  Apostles,  xvi.  37, %0aand  xxii.  25.— Wern,  Club. %0a%0a%0a228  History  of  Nature.

And  although %0awe  may  believe  that  he  dissembled  all  this  by  his  last  Dream,3 %0awherein  he  lay  as  if  he  were  dead,  upon  which  he  gave  out %0athis  Speech,  that  himself  alone  had  overcome  Envy  by  Glory  ; %0ayet  in  this  one  thing  he  confessed,  that  his  Felicity  was %0adefective,  inasmuch  as  he  had  not  Consecrated  the  Capitol. %0aQ.

And  yet  in  the %0avery  flower  of  these  Honours,  as  he  was  returning  from  the %0aField,  about  Noon-day,  he  was  seized  by  Catinius  Labeo, %0asurnamed  Macerio,  a  Tribune  of  the  Commons,  whom  he  by %0avirtue  of  his  Censorship  had  expelled  out  of  the  Senate  ;  and %0athe  Forum  of  the  Capitol  being  empty,  he  took  him  away  by %0aforce  to  the  Tarpeian  Rock,  with  an  intention  to  cast  him %0adown  headlong.  A  number  came  running  about  him  of  that %0acompany  which  called  him  Father;  but,  as  was  unavoidable %0ain  so  sudden  a  case,  slowly,  and  as  if  attending  a  Funeral ; %0awith  the  absence  also  of  a  right  to  make  Resistance,  and %0arepel  the  inviolable  Authority  :  so  that  he  was  likely  to  have %0aPerished  even  for  his  Virtue  and  faithful  Execution  of  his %0aCensorship,  if  there  had  not  been  one  Tribune  found,  with %0amuch  difficulty,  to  step  between  and  oppose  himself;  by %0awhich  means  he  was  rescued,  even  from  the  utmost  point  of %0aDeath.  He  lived  afterwards  by  the  liberality  of  other %0aMen  :  for  all  his  Goods  from  that  day  forward  were  devoted, %0afrom  his  Condemnation  :  as  if  he  had  not  suffered  Punish- %0ament enough  to  have  his  Neck  so  writhed,  as  that  the  Blood %0awas  squeezed  out  at  his  Ears.  And  truly  I  would  reckon  it %0aamong  his  Calamities,  that  he  was  an  Enemy  to  the  later %0aAfricanus,  even  by  the  Testimony  of  Macedonians  himself. %0aThese  were  his  words  to  his  Children :  Go,  my  Sons,  and %0ado  honour  to  his  Obsequies ;  for  the  Funeral  of  a  greater %0aCitizen  ye  will  never  see.  And  this  he  said  to  them,  when %0athey  had  conquered  Crete  and  the  Balearic  Islands,  and  had %0aworn  the  Diadem  in  triumph  :  being  himself  already  entitled %0aMacedonians.  But  if  we  consider  that  only  injury  offered  to %0ahim,  who  can  justly  deem  him  happy,  being  exposed  to  the %0apleasure  of  his  Enemy,  far  inferior  to  Africanus,  and  so  to %0acome  to  confusion  ?

This  Aglaus  was  a  Man  somewhat  advanced %0ain  Years,  dwelling  in  a  very  narrow  corner  of  Arcadia, %0awhere  he  had  a  little  Estate,  which  himself  cultivated  ;  and %0ait  was  sufficient  with  its  yearly  Produce  to  Support  him %0aplentifully  ;  out  of  it  he  never  went :  so  that  (as  appeared  by %0ahis  course  of  Life,)  as  he  coveted  very  little,  so  he  expe- %0arienced as  little  Trouble  while  he  Lived. %0a%0a%0aCHAPTER  XLV1I. %0a%0aWhom,  while  Living,  they  ordered  to  be  Worshipped %0aas  a  God.1 %0a%0aBY  the  appointment  of  the  same  Oracle,  arid  by  the %0aapprobation  of  Jupiter ,  the  Sovereign  of  the  Gods,  Euthymus %0athe  Wrestler,  who  always  was  Conqueror  at  Olympia,  except %0aonce,  was  Consecrated  a  God  while  he  lived,  and  knew  of  it ; %0ahe  was  born  at  Locri,  in  Italy,  where  one  Statue  of  his,  as %0aalso  another  at  Olympia,  were  both  on  one  Day  struck  with %0aLightning :  which  I  see  CaUimachus  wondered  at,  as  if %0anothing  else  were  worthy  of  Admiration ;  and  gave  order %0athat  he  should  be  Sacrificed  to,  as  to  a  God  :  which  was  per- %0aformed accordingly,  both  while  he  Lived  and  after  he  was %0aDead.  A  thing  that  I  wonder  at  more  than  at  any  thing %0aelse :  that  the  Gods  should  have  been  pleased  with  such %0aa  thing. %0a%0a1  It  was  scarcely  more  reasonable  to  worship  a  man  after  he  was  dead %0athan  during  his  life ;  and  yet  Pliny  must  have  joined  in  the  worship  of %0aAugustus  and  Julius  Caesar,  and  have  been  conscious,  as  appears  from %0aseveral  places  of  his  writings,  that  the  greatest  gods  of  his  country  had %0aformerly  been  living  men.  The  egregious  vanity  of  desiring  to  be  sup- %0aposed a  god  was  felt  by  Alexander  the  Great,  to  whose  application  for %0arecognition  in  this  character  the  Lacedaemonians  replied  by  an  edict,  that %0a"  If  Alexander  wished  to  be  a  god,  he  might  be  a  god."

Ephorus  saith,  that %0athe  Kings  of  Arcadia  usually  lived  to  300  Years.  Alexander %0aCornelius  writeth  of  one  Dando  in  Illyrica,  who  lived  500 %0aYears.  Xenophon  in  his  "  Periplus,"  maketh  mention  of  a %0aKing  of  a  People  upon  the  Sea-coasts,  who  lived  600  Years : %0aand  as  if  he  had  not  lied  enough  already,  he  saith,  that  his %0aSon  came  to  800.  All  these  strange  reports  proceed  from %0aignorance  of  the  times  past,  for  some  reckoned  the  Summer %0afor  one  Year,  and  the  Winter  for  another.  Others  reckoned %0aevery  Quarter  for  a  Year,  as  the  Arcadians,  whose  Year  was %0abut  three  Months.

It  thus  became  necessary, %0athat  he  who  was  a  physician  in  the  modern  meaning  of  the  word  should %0aalso  be  able  to  interpret  the  stars,  and  to  apply  mathematical  reasoning %0ato   the  laws   of  health  and  disease.     The   calculation  of  climacterical %0ayears,  and  the  ultimate  duration  of  human  life,  were  thus  decided  by  a %0acombination  of  intricate  mathematical  probabilities.     These  climacteric %0ayears  were  formed  on  the  multiplication  of  the  number  seven  by  the %0aunit  numbers,  and  at  them  the  most  important  of  the  periodic  changes %0aof  the  body  were  accomplished.     The  highest  number  thus  multiplied %0aformed  the  grand  climacteric,  after  which  the  changes  produced  a  retro- %0agression towards  feebleness  and  decay ;  the  danger  of  which  was  ever %0agreatest  at  the  climacterics.

This  gift  of  Nature,  truly,  what- %0aever is  bestowed  on  us,  is  frail  and  uncertain  :  and  in  those %0ain  whom  it  exists  in  the  largest  Measure,  it  is  but  short  and %0aevil  if  we  consider  the  whole  Course  of  it  from  Beginning  to %0aEnd.  Because  if  we  count  our  repose  by  Night,  a  Man %0amay  be  truly  said  to  live  but  one  half  of  his  Life ;  for  that %0aHalf  of  it  which  is  spent  in  Sleep  may  be  compared  to  Death  ; %0aand  if  he  cannot  Sleep,  it  is  a  Punishment.  Nor  are  the %0aYears  of  our  Infancy  to  be  reckoned,  for  this  Age  is  void  of %0aSense;  nor  those  of  old  Age,  which  is  the  punishment  of  a %0adisposition  to  live.  What  shall  I  speak  of  so  many  kinds  of %0aDangers,  so  many  Diseases,  so  many  Fears,  so  many  Cares, %0aso  many  Prayers  for  Death,  that  we  Pray  for  nothing  more %0afrequently  ?  and  therefore  Nature  knoweth  not  what  better %0athing  to  give  a  Man,  than  short  Life.

And  it  is %0asome  sort  of  Disease  to  die  through  wisdom,  for  Nature %0ahath  set  down  certain  Laws,  even  to  Diseases ;  as  that  the %0acircle  of  a  Quartan  Fever  never  beginneth  in  the  shortest %0aDays  of  the  Year,  neither  in  the  Months  of  Winter ;  that %0asome  Diseases  are  not  incident  to  those  that  are  above  Sixty %0aYears  of  Age  ;  that  others  again  pass  away  when  young %0aPeople  come  to  the  Age  of  Puberty  ;  and  especially  this  is %0aobserved  in  young  Women.  Old  People  are  the  least  liable %0ato  take  the  Plague.  Also  there  are  Sicknesses  that  follow %0aparticular  Regions,  affecting  the  Inhabitants  generally %0atherein.  There  are  some  again  that  take  hold  of  Servants %0aonly  ;  others  touch  the  highest  Persons  alone  :  and  so  from %0adegree  to  degree.  But  in  this  Place  it  is  to  be  observed,  that %0aa  Pestilence  beginneth  in  the  South  parts,  and  always  goeth %0atoward  the  West;  and  it  scarcely  ever  doeth  otherwise, %0aexcept  in  Winter,  and  then  it  doth  not  exceed  three %0aMonths.1 %0a%0aCHAPTEU  LI. %0a%0aOf  the  Signs  of  Death.12 %0a%0aNow  let  us  take  a  View  of  the  fatal  Signs  in  Sickness. %0aIn  the  Disease  of  Fury  (Madness),  to  Laugh  is  such  a  Sign  : %0aIn  the  Sickness  of  Wisdom  (Frenzy),  to  have  a  care  of %0athe  Fringes  of  their  Garments  and  Bedclothes,  to  smoothe %0athem  down  ;  the  neglect  of  such  things  as  would  prevent %0atheir  Sleep;  the  apologising  letting  go  of  their  Water.

And  whilst  there  are %0ainnumerable  Signs  that  presage  Death,  there  is  not  one  that %0acan  assure  a  Man  certainly  of  Life  and  Health.  For  Cato1 %0athe  Censor,  writing  to  his  Son  concerning  robust  Health, %0ahath  delivered  from  some  Oracle,  that  Youth  resembling %0aAge  is  a  Sign  of  untimely  Death.  Diseases  are  so  innu- %0amerable, that  Pherecydes,  of  the  Island  of  Syros,  died  of  a %0agreat  quantity  of  Creepers2  bursting  out  of  his  Body.  Some %0aare  never  free  of  a  Fever,  as  C.  Meccenas.  The  same  Man, %0afor  three  whole  Years  before  he  died,  never  was  asleep  for %0aa  single  Minute.  Antipater  Sidonius  the  Poet,  once  a  year %0aduring  his  Life  was  seized  with  an  Ague-fit  upon  his  Birth- %0aday only,  and  at  last  he  died  in  such  a  Fit  in  a  good %0aold  Age. %0a%0aCHAPTER  LII. %0a%0aOf  such  as  were  carried  forth  to  their  Funeral  and  revived %0a%0aagain. %0a%0aA.  VIOLA,  who  had  been  Consul,  came  to  himself  when %0ahe  was  on  the  Funeral  Pile ;  but  because  the  Flame  was  so %0aStrong  that  he  could  not  be  got  away,  he  was  burnt  alive. %0a%0a1  Cato's  knowledge  of  medical  subjects  may  be  judged  of  from  the %0aspecimens  of  miserable  quackery  contained  in  his  "  Treatise  on  Agricul- %0ature."     Much  of  it  consisted  of  charms,  in  unintelligible  jargon. — %0aWern.

For  the  same  reason  another %0aauthor  speaks  of  the  same  creatures  under  the  name  of  animalia  tetra,  or %0afoul  creatures.     It  was  the  disease  which  afflicted  Herod,  Acts  of  the %0aApostles,  xii.  23 ;    and  in  modern  times  Dr.  Heberden  records  a  case, %0a"  Commentaries,"  c.

Such  is  the  condi- %0ation of  Mortal  Men  ;  and  to  this  kind  of  Fortune,  and  such %0aas  this,  are  we  born  :  so  that  in  the  case  of  Man  there  is %0ano  assurance,  no,  not  even  in  his  Death.  We  read  in %0aChronicles,  that  the  Soul  of  Hermotimus  Clazomenius  was %0aaccustomed  to  leave  his  Body,  and  wandering  to  a  great %0adistance,  brought  him  backs  News  of  such  things  as  could %0anot  possibly  have  been  known  unless  it  had  been  present %0athere  ;  and  all  the  while  his  Body  lay  half  Dead.  This %0amanner  he  continued,  until  the  Cantharidae,  who  were  his %0aEnemies,  took  his  Body  and  burnt  it  to  Ashes ;  and  by  that %0ameans  disappointed  his  Soul  when  it  came  back  again  to %0aits  Sheath.  Also  it  is  said,  that  the  Spirit  of  Aristceas  in %0aProconnesus  was  seen  to  fly  out  of  his  Mouth  in  the  form %0aof  a  Raven ;  and  many  an  empty  Tale  folio  we  th  thereon  : %0afor  surely  I  take  it  to  be  no  better  than  a  Fable,  which  is  in %0alike  manner  reported  of  Epimenides  the  Gnossian,  that  when %0ahe  was  a  Boy,  and  wearied  with  Heat  and  Travel,  he  laid %0ahimself  down  in  a  Cave,  and  there  slept  for  57  Years.1  At %0alength  he  awoke,  as  if  on  the  very  next  Morning,  and  won- %0adered at  the  changed  face  of  every  thing  he  saw.  Hence  in  an %0aequal  number  of  Days  after,  he  grew  Old,  that  at  last  he  lived %0ato  the  Age  of  175  Years.

Also,  that  the  like  happened  at %0aAquinum.  Likewise,  that  in  Rome  one  Corfidius,  who  had %0amarried  his  own  Aunt  by  the  Mother's  side,  after  his %0aFuneral  had  been  set  in  order,  revived  again ;  and  the %0aOrderer  of  his  Funeral  was  by  him  carried  out  to  the %0asame.  Varro  also  addeth  some  surprising  things,  which %0aare  worth  the  rehearsal  at  large.  There  were  two  Brethren %0aof  the  Equestrian  order,  of  whom  the  elder,  named  Corfidius, %0ahappened  in  all  appearance  to  die;  and  when  his  last  Will %0awas  opened,  the  younger  Brother,  who  was  appointed  his %0aHeir,  gave  orders  for  his  Funeral.  In  the  meanwhile  the %0aMan  that  seemed  Dead,  by  clapping  one  Hand  against  the %0aother,1  raised  the  Servants  in  the  House ;  and  he  recounted %0ato  them  that  he  was  come  from  his  younger  Brother,  who %0ahad  recommended  his  Daughter  to  him  ;  and,  moreover,  that %0ahe  had  shewed  to  him  in  what  place  he  had  buried  his %0aGold,  without  the  knowledge  of  any  Man  :  requesting  him %0aalso  to  employ  that  Provision  which  he  had  prepared  for %0ahim  about  his  own  Funeral.  As  he  was  relating  this  matter, %0ahis  Brother's  domestic  Servants  came  in  great  haste  to  the %0aHouse,  and  brought  word  that  their  Master  was  dead ;  and %0athe  Gold  was  found  in  the  place  he  had  pointed  out.  And %0atruly  life  is  full  of  these  Divinations ;  but  they  are  not  to  be %0acompared  with  these,  as  for  the  most  part  they  are  mere %0alies,  as  we  will  prove  by  one  notable  example :  in  the %0aSicilian  War,  Gabienus,  one  of  the  bravest  Officers  of %0aCcBsars  Fleet,  was  taken  prisoner  by  Sex.  Pompey,  and  by %0acommandment  from  him  his  Head  was  almost  stricken  off, %0aso  that  it  scarcely  hung  to  the  Neck  by  the  Skin,  and  in  this %0acondition  he  lay  all  day  on  the  Shore.  When  it  grew %0atoward  the  Evening,  and  a  Company  were  flocked  about %0ahim,  with  a  groan  and  prayers  he  requested  that  Pompey %0awould  come  to  him,  or  at  least  send  some  one  of  those  who %0a%0a%0a1  Clapping  the  hands  together  appears  to  have  been  an  ordinary %0amethod  of  summoning  the  attendants  before  bells  came  into  use  for  that %0apurpose. —  Wern.

These  are  examples  of  happy  Deaths.  But, %0aon  the  other  hand,  there  is  a  very  great  number  of  those  that %0aare  miserable.  L.  Domitius,  descended  from  a  noble  Family, %0abeing  vanquished  by  Ccesar  near  Massilia,  and  taken  pri- %0asoner at  Corsinium  by  the  same  Ccesar,  for  very  irksomeness %0aof  Life  poisoned  himself;  but  after  he  had  drunk  the %0aPoison  he  did  all  he  could  to  save  his  life.  We  find  in  the %0aPublic  Acts,  that  when  Felix,  one  of  the  Red-coloured %0aChariot- drivers,  was  carried  out  to  be  burnt,  one  of  those %0awho  favoured  him  threw  himself  into  his  Funeral  Fire.  A %0afrivolous  matter  it  is  to  speak  of;  but  they  of  the  other  side, %0athat  this  act  should  not  be  ascribed  to  the  honour  of  the %0aArtist  abovenamed,  gave  it  out,  that  this  Friend  of  his  did  it %0aonly  because  his  Head  was  intoxicated  with  the  strong  smell %0aof  the  Odours.  Not  long  before  this  M.  Lepidus,1  descended %0afrom  a  most  noble  Family,  who  (as  is  above  said)  died %0athrough  Grief,  was  by  the  violence  of  the  Flame  cast  off  from %0athe  Funeral  Pile ;  and  as,  because  of  the  extreme  Heat,  no %0aone  could  come  near  to  lay  him  again  on  the  place,  he  was %0aburnt  naked  on  a  pile  of  dry  Vine  Cuttings,  near  the  former. %0a%0aCHAPTER  LIV.         t .,_ %0aOf  Burial. %0a%0aTo  burn  the  Bodies2  of  the  Dead  was  not  an  ancient %0aCustom  among  the  Romans  ;  but  they  Buried  them  in  the %0a%0a1  The  cause  of  his  death  is  mentioned  in  the  36th  chapter  of  this %0abook.—  Wern.

But  after  they  understood  that  the  Bodies  of  the %0aMen  slain  in  the  distant  Wars  were  taken  up  out  of  the  Earth %0aagain,  it  was  appointed  to  Burn  them.  And  yet  many  Fami- %0alies kept  still  to  the  old  Customs:  as  in  the  House  of  the %0aCornelii  no  one  is  reported  to  have  been  burnt  before  L. %0aSylla,  the  Dictator.  And  he  willed  it  through  dread  that  he %0ashould  be  so  served  as  he  had  done  by  C.  Marius,  whose %0aCorpse  he  had  caused  to  be  digged  up.  (In  Latin)  he  is  said %0ato  be  Sepultus,  who  is  bestowed  in  any  way ;  but  Humatus %0asigriifieth  that  he  is  covered  with  the  Earth. %0a%0aCHAPTER  LV. %0aOf  the  Soul,  or  the  Manes.1 %0a%0aAFTER  Sepulture  there  is  very  great  Obscurity  regarding %0athe  Manes  ;  but  this  is  generally  held,  that  in  whatever  Con- %0afamiliarly  spoken  of  by  Homer.  That  it  was  more  ancient  among  the %0aRomans  than  is  represented  by  Pliny  appears  from  Ovid  ;  who  ("  Fasti," %0ac.  4)  speaks  of  its  having  been  practised  on  the  body  of  Remus,  the  bro- %0ather of  Romulus.  The  same  is  also  negatively  proved  by  Numa,  who %0aordered  that  his  body  should  not  be  burned ;  and  by  the  laws  of  the %0aTwelve  Tables,  regulations  were  instituted  concerning  it :  chiefly  to  pre- %0avent extravagant  expense  in  the  ceremony.  The  general  fashion  of %0aburning,  in  preference  to  interment,  succeeded  to  the  example  set  by %0aSylla ;  after  whose  day  it  was  practised  even  by  people  of  inferior  orders  : %0abut  neither  burning  nor  burial  were  allowed  by  law  within  the  bounds %0aof  the  city.  An  ordinance  of  Numa  forbade  that  a  woman  who  died  in %0achildbirth  should  be  buried,  until  the  child  was  taken  from  her  ;  and  the %0ausual  ceremonies  were  to  be  omitted  when  the  person  had  been  killed  by %0alightning. — Wern.  Club. %0a%0a1  "  Manes  "  was  a  general  term  expressive  of  the  souls  of  men  after %0athey  were  separated  from  the  body.  They  were  supposed  to  be  arranged %0ain  classes,  according  to  their  moral  condition  :  for  which  see  a  note, %0avol.  i.  p.  24.  But  however  situated,  a  kind  of  deityship  was  supposed  to %0aattach  itself  to  them :  and  hence  they  were  addressed  as  Dii  Manes. %0aSuch  was  the  popular  opinion,  as  referred  to  by  Virgil,  Ovid,  and  other %0awriters  who  reflected  the  public  mind ;  but  it  was  scarcely  an  article  of %0afaith  among  philosophers  and  the  higher  classes,  whose  opinions  fluctuated %0aaccording  to  circumstances.  As  a  motive  to  moral  obligation  and  respon- %0asibility it  was  exceedingly  feeble. %0a%0aPliny's  observation,  "  that  in  whatever  condition  they  were  before %0a%0a%0a248  History  of  Nature.

For  neither  Body  nor  Soul %0ahath  any  more  Sense  after  Death  than  they  had  before  the %0aDay  of  Birth.  But  the  Vanity  of  Men  extendeth  itself  even %0ainto  the  future,  and  in  the  very  Time  of  Death  fiattereth %0aitself  with  a  Life  after  this.  For  some  attribute  Immortality %0ato  the  Soul ;  others  devise  a  Transfiguration  ;  some  again %0a%0athey  were  born,  in  the  same  they  remain  after  they  are  dead,"  may  be %0aunderstood  as  referring  to  the  Pythagorean  doctrine  of  Transmigration  ; %0awhich  was  the  most  plausible  account  .of  the  disposition  of  the  intelligent %0aprinciple  that  the  Heathens  could  reach  to,  before  Light  and  Immor- %0atality were  revealed  in  the  Gospel;  but  by  the  almost  contemptuous %0asilence  with  which  he  passes  it  over  in  his  argument,  it  appears  that  he %0adid  not  feel  disposed  to  credit  it.  With  regard  to  the  station  of  the %0amanes,  Plato  supposes  that  impure  spirits  wander  about  among  sepulchres %0aand  monuments.  Homer  represents  Elpenor  as  prevented  from  rest %0auntil  the  funeral  rites  were  paid ;  and  a  commonly  received  doctrine  was, %0athat  there  were  days  sacred  to  Dis  and  Proserpine,  on  which  the  whole  of %0athe  secret  and  deep  places  of  the  world  were  thrown  open,  and  the  disem- %0abodied spirits  were  permitted  to  revisit  the  light.  Varro  supposes  that %0athis  occurs  three  times  in  the  year :  on  the  feast  of  Vulcanalia,  tenth  of %0athe  Calends  of  September,  or  23d  of  August ;  on  the  3d  of  the  Nones  of %0aOctober,  the  Fontinalia,  October  13 ;  and  the  6th  of  the  Ides  of  November, %0aor  8th  of  that  month. %0a%0aAccording  to  the  doctrine  of  the  Jewish  Rabbis,  derived,  no  doubt, %0afrom  ancient  Oriental  sources,  "  during  the  first  twelve  months  after %0adeath  the  souls  of  righteous  men  descend  and  ascend  again  "  (Talmud,  tr. %0aSabbath) :  which  Rabbi  Joseph  Albo,  in  the  "  Book  of  Principles,"  c.  xxxi., %0aexplains  by  saying,  that  the  soul  does  not  directly  and  at  once  become %0adivested  of  those  corporeal  attachments  to  which  it  is  accustomed,  but %0alingers  about  them  until  by  habit  it  becomes  weaned  from  them,  and %0aassimilated  to  the  new  condition  on  which  it  has  entered. %0a%0aThe  gloomy  views  which  even  the  more  virtuous  of  the  ancient  Hea- %0athens took  of  an  invisible  world  is  shewn  by  Homer's  representations  in %0athe  "  Odyssey,"  b.  xi. ;  and  by  so  much  of  Etrurian  learning  as,  from %0atheir  paintings  and  other  representations,  have  descended  to  us.  With  so %0amuch  distaste  of  a  wearisome  life  on  the  one  hand  (in  which  even  Homer %0ajoins,  b.  xvii.),  and  on  the  other  the  dim  prospect  of  the  dreary  regions %0abelow,  we  can  scarcely  wonder  if  even  the  virtuous  Pliny  should  choose %0arather  to  lie  down  in  ashes  without  the  prospect  of  living  again.  The %0agreater  portion  of  his  argument,  however,  is  founded  on  his  ignorance : %0ahis  questions,  then  so  doubtful,  are  such  as  now  even  a  child  may  answer. %0a—  Wern.

What %0aRepose  should  ever  Men  have  that  are  born,  if  the  Sense  of %0atheir  Souls  should  remain  on  high,  while  their  Shadows  are %0aamong  those  below  ?

For  if  it  be  sweet  to  live,  what  Plea- %0asure can  one  have,  that  hath  already  lived  ?

She  it  was  that  began  to  make %0aLaws ;  but  others  have  thought  that  Rhadamanthns  was  the %0afirst  Lawgiver.     I  am  of  opinion,  that  Letters  ever  were  in %0aAssyria ;  but  some  think,  as  particularly  Gellius,  that  they %0awere  invented  by  Mercury  in  Egypt,  and  others  will  have  it %0athat  they  came  first  from  Syria.     True  it  is,  that  Cadmus %0abrought  into  Greece  from  Phcenice  to  the  Number  of  sixteen; %0ato  which  Palamedes,  in  the  Time  of  the  Trojan  War,  added %0afour,  in  these  characters,  0,  3,  %3c£,  X.    And  after  him  Simon- %0aides  Melicus1  produced  the  same  Numbers,  z,  H,  T,  a :  the %0aForce  of  all  which  Letters  we  acknowledge  among  ourselves. %0aAristotle  is  rather  of  opinion,  that  there  were  eighteen  an- %0acient Letters :  A,  B,  r,  A,  E,  z,  i,  K,  A,  M,  N,  o,  n,  p,  2,  T,  r,  $, %0aand  that  the  other  two,  0  and  X,  were  added  by  Epicharmus, %0aand  not  by  Palamedes.    Anticlides  writeth,  that  one  in  Egypt %0anamed  Menon  was  the  Inventor  of  Letters,  fifteen  Years  be- %0afore the  Time  of  Phoroneus,  the  most  ancient  King  of  Greece : %0aand  he  endeavoureth  to  prove  the  same  by  Monuments.    On %0athe  other  Hand,  Epigenes,  an  Author  as  renowned  as  any, %0asheweth,   that   among   the    Babylonians   there   were   found %0aObservations  of  the  Stars  for  7*20  Years,  written  on  Bricks  ; %0aand  they  who  speak  of  the  least,  as  Berosus  and  Critodemus, %0areport  the  like  for  480  Years.     Whereby  it  appeareth  that %0athe  use  of  Letters  was  eternal.     The  Pelasgi  brought  their %0ause  into  Latium.     Euryalus  and  Hyperbius,  two  Brothers  at %0aAthens,  invented  the  first  Manufacture  of  Bricks  and  the %0aFormation  of  Houses  ;  for  before  their  Time  Caves  were  used %0afor  Houses.

The  Egyptians  affirm,  that %0along  before  that,  their  City  Diospolis  was  founded.

Staphylus,  the  Son  of  Silenus, %0ataught  how  to  mix  Wine  with  Water.  Aristceus  the  Athenian %0ainvented  the  making  of  Oil,  and  also  the  Press  belonging  to %0ait.  The  same  Man  taught  to  draw  Honey  from  the  Combs. %0aBuzyges  the  Athenian,  or  as  others  have  it,  Triptolemus, %0aemployed  Oxen  for  the  Plough.  The  Egyptians  were  the %0afirst  that  had  a  royal  City,  and  the  Athenians  a  popular %0aCity.  After  Theseus,  the  first  Tyrant  was  Phalaris  of  Agri- %0agentum.  The  Lacedaemonians  first  invented  the  Condition %0aof  Slavery.  The  first  Judgment  for  Death  WHS  in  the  Court %0aof  Areopagus.  The  first  Battle  was  fought  between  the  Afri- %0acans and  Egyptians ;  and  the  same  was  done  with  Clubs, %0awhich  they  call  Phalangae.  Shields  were  contrived  by %0aPrcetus  and  Acrisius,  when  they  warred  against  each  other ; %0aor  by  Calchus,  the  Son  of  Athamas.  Midias  of  Messene  in- %0avented the  Cuirass,  and  the  Lacedaemonians  the  Helmet, %0aSword,  and  Spear.  The  Carians  contrived  Greaves,  and %0aCrests  (upon  Helmets):  Scythes,  the  Son  of  Jupiter,  the  Bow %0aand  Arrows;  although  some  say  that  Perses,  the  Son  of %0aPerseus,  invented  Arrows.  The  ^Etolians  invented  the %0aLance ;  the  Dart  with  a  Loop  was  by  JEtolus,  the  Son  of %0aMars :  the  light  Javelins  and  the  Pilum  by  Tyrrhenus ;  and %0aPenthesilea  the  Amazon,  the  Battle-axe.  Piseus  found  out %0athe  Boar-spear  and  Chasing-staff.

Piseus %0athe  Tyrrhenian  first  used  the  hrazen  Trumpet;  and  Arthemon %0athe  Clazomenian,  Tortoises.  The  Engine  to  batter  Walls %0a(called  sometimes  the  Horse,  and  now  the  Ram)  was  the %0aDevice  of  Epeus  at  Troy.  Bellerophon  shewed  first  how  to %0aride  on  Horseback :  Pelethronius  invented  the  Saddle  and %0aBridle  for  the  Horse.  The  Thessalians,  called  Centaurs, %0ainhabiting  near  the  Mountain  Pelius,  were  the  first  that %0afought  on  Horseback.  The  Nation  of  the  Phrygians  first %0ajoined  two  Horses  to  a  Chariot ;  and  Erichthonius  four. %0aPalamedes,  during  the  Trojan  War,  invented  the  manner %0aof  setting  an  Army  in  array:  also  the  giving  of  a  Signal, %0athe  Watch-word,  and  the  Outposts  (VigiliaB).  In  the  same %0aWar,  Sinon  devised  Watch-towers.  Lycanor  was  the  first %0aMaker  of  a  Truce  :  Theseus,  of  Alliances  :  Car,  from  whom %0aCaria  took  its  Name,  observed  first  the  Flight  of  Birds %0a(Augury) ;  to  which  Orpheus  added  the  Signs  from  other %0aAnimals.  Delphus  invented  Divination  from  the  Entrails %0a(Aruspices) :  Amphiaraus,  that  of  the  Inspection  of  Fire %0a(Ignispex)  :  Tyresias,  the  Theban,  that  of  the  Auspices  of %0aBirds.  Amphictyon  gave  the  Interpretation  of  portentous %0aSights,  and  of  Dreams.  Atlas,  the  Son  of  Libya  (or, %0aas  some  say,  the  Egyptians,  and  as  others  the  Assyrians), %0ainvented  Astrology  ;  and  in  that  Science,  Anaximander  the %0aMilesian  devised  the  Sphere.  The  Explanation  of  the %0aWinds  was  given  by  JEolus,  the  Son  of  Helen.  Amphion %0ainvented  Music.  The  Flute  and  the  single  Pipe1  were %0athe  Invention  of  Pan,  the  Son  of  Mercury.  The  oblique %0aCornet  was  by  Midas  in  Phrygia  ;  and  in  the  same  Country %0aMarsyas  invented  the  Double  Flute ;  Amphion  taught  the %0aLydian  Measures;  Thamyras  the  Thracian,  the  Dorian;  and %0aMarsyas  of  Phrygia,  the  Phrygian.  Amphion,  likewise  (or, %0aas  some  say,  Orpheus,  and  according  to  others,  Linus},  played %0afirst  on  the  Lute.2  Ter pander  added  seven  Strings  to  it; %0aSimonides  added  the  eighth ;  and  Timotheus  the  ninth.  Tha- %0amyras was  the  first  that  played  on  the  Lute  without  Song, %0a%0a1  Fistula  and  Monaiilus.  —  Wern.  Club.  a  Cithara.  —  Wern.  Club. %0a%0a%0a254  History  of  Nature.  [  BOOK  VII. %0a%0aand  Amphion  sung  with  it,  or,  according  to  some,  Linus. %0aTerpander  adapted  Songs  to  the  Lute.  Dardanus,  the  Tro3- %0azenian,  began  first  vocal  Music  to  the  Flute.1  The  Curetes %0ataught  to  dance  in  Armour ;  and  Pyrrhus  the  Pyrrhic  Dance  ; %0aand  both  these  were  first  practised  in  Crete.  The  Heroic %0aVerse  we  owe  to  the  Oracle  of  Pythius  (Apollo}.  About  the %0aOriginal  of  Poems  there  is  a  great  Question.  They  are %0aproved  to  have  existed  before  the  Trojan  War.  Pherecydes %0aof  Syros,  in  the  Days  of  King  Cyrus,  invented  the  Writing %0ain  Prose.  Cadmus  the  Milesian  founded  History.  Lycaon %0aappointed  the  first  public  Games  of  Strength  in  Arcadia ; %0aAcastus  in  lolcum,  the  first  solemn  Games  at  Funerals ;  and %0aafter  him  Theseus,  in  the  Isthmus.  Hercules  instituted  the %0aAthletic  Exercises  at  Olympia  :  and  Pythus  those  of  Play  at %0aBall.  Gyges  the  Lydian  first  practised  Painting  in  Egypt; %0abut  in  Greece,  Euchir,  a  Relative  of  Dcedalus,  as  Aristotle %0asupposeth  ;  and  according  to  Theophrastus,  it  was  Polygnotus %0athe  Athenian.  Danaus  was  the  first  that  sailed  with  a  Ship, %0aand  so  he  passed  the  Sea  from  Egypt  to  Greece ;  for  before %0athat  time  they  used  Rafts,  which  were  invented  by  King %0aErythra,  to  cross  from  one  Island  to  another  in  the  Red  Sea. %0aBut  we  meet  with  some  Writers  who  suppose  that  the  Tro- %0ajans and  Mysians  were  the  first  that  devised  Navigation  be- %0afore them  in  the  Hellespont,  when  they  passed  over-against %0athe  Thracians.

Zenagoras  of  Syracusa  brought %0aup  those  of  six  Rows  ;  and  from  it  to  those  of  ten,  Mnesigeton %0awas  the  Inventor.  It  is  said  that  Alexander  the  Great  built %0aGalleys  with  twelve  Banks  ;  and  Philostephanus  reporteth, %0athat  Ptolemy  Soter  rose  to  fifteen :  Demetrius,  the  Son  of %0aAntiaonus,  to  thirty  :  Ptolemy  Philadelphus,  to  forty ;  and %0aPtolemy  Philopater,  surnamed  Tryphon,  to  fifty.  Hippus %0athe  Tyrian  invented  Ships  of  Burden.1  The  Cyrenians  first %0abuilt  the  Pinnace ;  the  Phoenicians,  the  Ferry-boat ;  the %0aRhodians,  the  Wherry ;  and  last,  the  Cyprians,  the  Hulk. %0aThe  Phoenicians  were  the  first  that  in  sailing  observed  the %0aCourse  of  the  Stars.  The  Copeans  devised  the  Oar,  and  the %0aPlateans  its  broad  End  :  Icarus,  the  Sails  :  Dcedalus,  the %0aMast  and  the  Yard.  Vessels  for  transporting  Horses  were %0athe  Invention  of  the  Samians,  or  else  of  Pericles  the  Athe- %0anian. The  Thasii  formed  the  long-covered  Ships :  for  before %0atheir  Time  they  fought  only  from  the  Stern  and  the  Bow. %0aPiseus  added  the  Rostra ;  the  Tyrrhenians,  the  Anchor ;  to %0awhich  Eupalamus  added  the  two  Claws,  and  Anac/tarsis  the %0aGrappling-hooks.  The  Stock  was  by  Pericles  the  Athenian ; %0aand  finally,  the  Steering-tackle  by  Typhis.  The  Chief  that %0afirst  fought  in  a  Fleet  was  Minos.  The  first  that  killed  a %0aBeast  was  HyperHus,  the  Son  of  Mars;  and  Prometheus  first %0akilled  an  Ox.2 %0a%0a1  The  names  of  these  ships  in  the  original  are,  Oneraria,  Cymba, %0aCelox,  Cercuros. —  Wern.

The  Protogonus  and  (Eon  here  spoken  of,  being  the %0afirst  generation  of  mortals,  were  the  discoverers  of  the  way  of  taking %0afood  from  trees;  and  their  children,  Genus  and  Genea,  in  a  time  of %0ascarcity  in  Phanicia,  first  worshipped  the  sun,  as  Beelsamin,  or  only %0aLord  of  Heaven. %0a%0a"  Hypsuranius,  a  Tyrian,  first  made  huts  of  reeds  and  rushes,  and  the %0apaper-reeds.  His  brother  Usoiis  first  invented  covering  for  his  body,  out %0aof  the  skins  of  wild  beasts  which  he  could  catch ;  which  may  be  reconciled %0awith  the  narrative  in  Genesis,  iii.  21.  He  consecrated  two  rude  stone %0apillars  to  the  fire  and  wind,  and  worshipped  them  with  the  sprinkling  of %0athe  blood  of  wild  beasts  taken  in  hunting.  He  first  ventured  on  the  sea %0ain  a  kind  of  raft ;  and  on  his  death  were  first  instituted  anniversary  feasts. %0aMany  years  after  him,  Agreus  and  Halieus  were  the  inventors  of  the  arts, %0aand  it  would  appear,  the  fathers  of  tribes  who  pursued  hunting  and  fish- %0aing. The  two  brothers  who  invented  the  working  of  iron  were  their %0asons.  One  of  these,  named  Chrysor,  the  same  as  Vulcan,  employed %0acharms  and  divinations ;  he  invented  the  hook,  bait,  and  fishing-line,  and %0aboats  slightly  made :  perhaps  those  covered  with  leather,  mentioned  by %0aPliny  as  used  in  his  day  in  Britain,  and  originally  derived  from  this %0aEastern  source.  This  Coracle,  employed  so  late  as  the  fourth  or  fifth  cen- %0atury of  Christianity  in  crossing  the  British  Channel,  is  still  used  in  Welsh %0arivers,  and  is  figured,  in  its  modern  structure,  by  Mr.  Yarrell  ("  History %0aof  British  Fishes,"  vol.  ii.  p.  62,  2d  edit.)  :  a  copy  from  an  ancient  relievo %0ain  Montfaucon  is  at  the  end  of  this  volume.  It  was  a  subsequent  race, %0athe  Cabiri,  that  formed  the  first  complete  ship.  From  the  last  generation, %0aor  Chrysor  and  his  brother,  sprang  two  brothers :  one  called  Technites,  or %0athe  artist,  and  the  other,  Ge'inus  Autochthon,  the  home-born  man  of  the %0aearth.  These  first  mingled  stubble  with  the  brick  earth,  and  dried  the %0atiling  in  the  sun.  This  accommodation  was  further  improved  by  the  for- %0amation of  courts,  fences,  and  cellars  about  houses.  They  were  husband- %0amen, and  worshipped  a  statue  carried  about  in  a  movable  temple,  drawn %0aby  oxen.  This  practice  is  alluded  to  by  the  prophet  Amos,  v.  26,  and %0aperhaps  2  Samuel,  vi.  3  and  7.  These  were  the  first  that  employed  dogs %0ain  the  hunting  of  wild  animals.

Inachus,  whom  Archbishop  Usher  makes  contem- %0aporary with  the  Scriptural  Nahor,  was  the  inventor  of  honorary  gold  and %0asilver  chains.  The  purple  dye  from  shell-fish  was  discovered  by  the  Phre- %0anician  Hercules,  the  great  navigator  Melcartus,  who  first  passed  through %0athe  Straits  of  Gibraltar,  and  visited  Cornwall.  It  is  true,  there  seems  some %0adoubt  whether  there  be  not  two  individuals  referred  to  under  this  name, %0aone  of  whom  lived  in  the  days  of  Canaan ;  but  if  so,  at  least  they  were %0anatives  of  the  same  country,  and  were  both  honoured  by  their  country- %0amen as  inventors  of  the  arts  by  which  the  nation  acquired  riches  and %0aeminency.  Cronus  first  taught  the  use  of  the  bow  as  a  weapon;  which %0atook  place  in  Crete,  an  island  afterwards  famous  for  this  kind  of  skill. %0a4  Eupolemus  says  of  Enoch,  that  he  was  the  true  Atlas,  the  inventor  of %0aastronomy.'  Finally,  the  infamy  of  having  first  practised  persecution  for %0areligion  is  ascribed  to  Cronus,  who  is  supposed  to  be  Ham,  the  son  of %0aNoah,  with  the  concurrence  of  the  Egyptian  Thoth ;  but  the  Jews  are %0ainclined  to  derive  its  origin  from  the  city  of  Ur,  in  Chaldaea,  where  Terah %0awas  put  to  death  in  the  fire  (Ur)  :  but  in  either  case  the  act  was  devised %0ain  support  of  false  religion,  or  idolatry." — Wern.

The  first  that %0aentered  Italy  came  from  Sicily,  in  the  454th  Year  after  the %0aFoundation  of  Rome.  They  were  brought  in  by  P.  Ticinius %0aMena,  as  Varro  reporteth:  for  before  this  they  were  un- %0ashorn. The  first  that  took  up  the  practice  to  Shave  every %0aday  was  Scipio  Africanus :  and  after  him  cometh  Divus %0aAugustus,  who  always  used  the  Rasor.1 %0a%0aCHAPTER  LX. %0aWhen  was  the  fast  Dial.2 %0a%0aTHE  third  Consent  of  all  Nations  was  in  the  observation  of %0athe  Hours ;  and  this  was  grounded  upon  Reason :  but  at %0awhat  Time,  and  by  whom  this  was  Invented  in  Greece,  we %0ahave  declared  in  the  Second  Book  ;  and  it  was  late  before %0athis  came  up  at  Rome.

"  I  do  not  conceive,"  he  says,  "  how  a  sun-dial  or  any  other %0ainstrument  could  point  out  the  various  hours,  as  time  was  computed  by %0athe  ancient  Romans.     The  time  the  earth  takes  to  revolve  once  round  its %0aaxis,  or  the  space  between  the  rising  of  the  sun  till  its  next  rising,  which %0amakes  a  day  and  a  night,  divided  into  twenty-four  equal  parts,  we  call %0ahours.

But %0awhen  the  Sun  inclined  downward  from  the  Column  named %0aMoenia,  to  the  Prison,  he  proclaimed  the  last  Quarter  (of  the %0aDay).  But  this  observation  would  serve  only  on  clear  Days  ; %0aand  yet  it  was  so  until  the  first  Punic  War.  Fabius  Vestalis %0awriteth,  that  L.  Papyrius  Cursor,  the  Prince,  twelve  Years %0abefore  the  War  with  Pyrrhus,  to  do  the  Romans  a  pleasure %0aset  up  a  Sun-dial  on  the  Temple  of  Quirinus,  when  it  was %0adedicated,  his  Father  having  vowed  it  before  him.  But %0athis  Author  sheweth  not  either  the  method  of  that  Dial,  or %0athe  Workman ;  nor  yet  from  whence  it  was  brought,  nor  in %0awhat  Writer  he  found  it  so  written.  M.  Varro  reporteth, %0athat  the  first  Dial  was  set  up  in  the  common  Market-place, %0aupon  a  Column  near  the  Rostra,  in  the  first  Punic  War,  by %0aM.  Valerius  Messala,  the  Consul,  presently  after  the  taking %0aof  Catana,  in  Sicily ;  from  whence  it  was  brought,  thirty %0aYears  after  the  report  of  the  aforesaid  Dial  of  Papyrius,  in %0athe  Year  of  the  City  477.  And  although  the  Lines  of  this %0aDial  did  not  agree  with  the  Hours,  yet  were  the  People %0agoverned  by  it  for  an  hundred  Years  save  one,  until %0aQ.  Martius  Philippus,  who  was  Censor,  with  L.  Paulus, %0aset  another  by  it,  made  more  carefully.  And  this  gift, %0aamong  other  things  done  by  the  Censor,  was  highly %0aacceptable  to  the  People.  But  notwithstanding  this,  if  it %0awere  a  cloudy  Day  the  Hours  were  uncertain ;  and  thus  it %0a%0astituted  their  day ;  and  the  other  twelve,  from  the  setting  of  the  sun  to %0aits  rising,  constituted  their  night.  Thus,  as  the  seasons  changed,  the %0alength  of  their  hours  must  have  varied.  In  winter  the  twelve  hours  of %0athe  day  were  short,  and  those  of  the  night  long :  in  summer  they  were %0athe  reverse.  How  then  could  these  hours,  of  an  unequal  length,  and %0awhich  daily  varied,  be  measured  by  an  instrument  ?  I  have  not  been %0aable  to  discover  any  method  by  which  this  could  be  done.  However, %0athey  had  two  fixed  points,  namely,  mid-day  and  midnight,  which  they %0acalled  the  sixth  hour.  So  that  a  meridian  line  would  always  point  out %0athe  sixth  hour,  or  mid- day." %0a%0aThat  the  dial  was  a  very  ancient  instrument  for  measuring  time %0aappears  from  the  2d  Book  of  Kings,  xx.  11,  and  Isaiah,  xxxviii.  8, %0awhere  is  the  first  mention  of  it  on  record.

PLINIUS  SECUNDUS. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c THE  PREFACE. %0a%3c %0a%3c BW-5SES8HUS  we  have  in  the  former  Books  treated  of %0a%3c the  World,  and  of  the  Lands,  Nations,  Seas, %0a%3c Islands,  and  remarkable  Cities  therein  con- %0a%3c tained. It  remainetli  now  to  discourse  of  the %0a%3c Nature  of  the  Living  Creatures  comprised  within %0a%3c the  same :  a  point  which  would  require  as  deep %0a%3c a  Contemplation  as  any  other  Part  whatsoever,  if  the  Mind %0a%3c of  Man  were  able  to  comprehend  all  the  Things.  By  right %0a%3c the  chief  place  is  assigned  to  Man,  for  whose  sake  it  appears %0a%3c that  Nature  produced  all  other  Creatures ;  though  this  great %0a%3c favour  of  hers  is  severe  as  set  against  all  her  other  Gifts :  so %0a%3c that  it  is  hard  to  judge  whether  she  is  a  kinder  Parent  to %0a%3c Man,  or  a  cruel  Step-mother.  For,  in  preference  to  all  other %0a%3c Living  Creatures,  the  one  she  hath  clothed  with  the  Riches  of %0a%3c others :  to  the  rest  she  hath  assigned  a  variety  of  Coverings : %0a%3c as  Shells,  Barks,  Hard  Hides,  Spines,  Shag,  Bristles,  Hair, %0a%3c Feathers,  Quills,  Scales,  and  Fleeces.  The  Trunks  and %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 174  History  of  Nature.  [BOOK  VII. %0a%3c %0a%3c Stems  of  Trees  she  hath  defended  with  Bark,  which  is  some- %0a%3c times double,  against  the  injuries  both  of  Heat  and  Cold ! %0a%3c Man  alone  she  hath  cast  all  Naked  upon  the  bare  Earth, %0a%3c even  on'  his  Birth-day,  immediately  to  cry  and  lament :  so %0a%3c that  among  so  many  Living  Creatures  there  is  none  subject %0a%3c to  shed  Tears  and  Weep  like  him  from  the  very  onset  of  his %0a%3c Existence.  And  verily,  however  forward  and  active  we  may %0a%3c be,  to  no  one  is  it  given  to  laugh  before  he  is  Forty  Days  old. %0a%3c From  this  glimmering  of  Light  he  is  bound  fast,  and  hath %0a%3c no  Member  at  liberty ;  a  thing  which  is  not  practised  upon %0a%3c the  Young  of  any  Wild  Beast  among  us.  The  Child  thus %0a%3c unhappily  born,  and  who  is  to  rule  all  other,  lieth  bound1 %0a%3c Hand  and  Foot,  weeping  and  crying ;  and  .receiveth  the %0a%3c auspices  of  Life  with  Punishments,  to  make  satisfaction. for %0a%3c this  only  Fault,  that  he  is  born  Alive.  What  madness  in %0a%3c such  as  think  this  the  proper  Beginning  of  those  who  are %0a%3c born  to  be  proud  !  The  first  Hope  of  our  Strength,  the  first %0a%3c gift  that  Time  affordeth  us,  maketh  us  no  better  than  four- %0a%3c footed  Beasts.  How  long  ere  we  can  go  alone  !  How  long- %0a%3c before  we  can  speak,  feed  ourselves  !  How  long  continueth %0a%3c the  Crown  of  our  Heads  to  palpitate, — the  mark  of  our  ex- %0a%3c ceeding great  weakness  above  all  other  Creatures !  Then %0a%3c the  Sicknesses,  and  so  many  Medicines  devised  against  these %0a%3c Maladies :  besides  the  new  Diseases  that  spring  up  to %0a%3c overcome  us.  Other  Living  Creatures  understand  their %0a%3c own  Nature ;  some  assume  the  use  of  their  swift  Feet, %0a%3c others  of  their  Wings ;  some  are  Strong ;  others  able  to %0a%3c Swim ;  but  Man  knoweth  nothing  unless  he  be  taught : %0a%3c not  even  to  speak,  or  go,  or  eat :  arid,  in  short,  -he  is %0a%3c naturally  good  at  nothing  but  to  weep.  And  hence  some %0a%3c have  insisted  on  it,  that  it  is  best  for  a  man  never  to  have %0a%3c been  born,  or  else  speedily  to  die.  To  one  only,  of  living %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  The  artificial  bandages  inflicted  on  new-born  children  are  the  swad- %0a%3c dling-clothes referred  to  in  St.  Luke's  Gospel,  c.  ii.  v.  7 ;  but  they  can %0a%3c scarcely  be  numbered  among  the  necessary  evils  of  humanity,  for  they %0a%3c have  long  since  been  abolished  in  England.  In  the  seventh  chapter  of %0a%3c this  Book  the  Author  dwells  again  on  the  littleness  and  misery  of  the %0a%3c human  race. — Wern.  Club. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BOOK  VII.]  History  of  Nature.  175 %0a%3c %0a%3c Creatures  is  it  given  to  mourn,  one  only  is  guilty  of  excess, %0a%3c and  that  in  a  vast  variety  of  ways,  and  through  every  Mem- %0a%3c ber that  he  has.  Who  but  we  are  ambitious  ?  Who  but %0a%3c we  are  avaricious  ?  None  but  we  possess  the  extravagant %0a%3c desire  of  living,  are  superstitious,  anxious  for  our  burial, %0a%3c and  what  shall  be  our  fate  when  we  are  gone.  To  none  is %0a%3c Life  more  frail ;  yet  to  no  Creature  is  there  a  greater  craving %0a%3c after  every  thing ;  none  suffereth  under  a  more  terrifying %0a%3c Fear ;  and  none  more  furious  in  his  Rage.  To  conclude,  other %0a%3c Animals  live  orderly  according  to  their  kind :  we  see  them %0a%3c flock  together,  and  stand  against  others  of  a  contrary  kind; %0a%3c the  Lions,  though  savage,  fight  not  one  with  another ; %0a%3c Serpents  sting  not  Serpents :  and  even  the  very  Beasts  and %0a%3c Fishes  of  the  Sea  war  not  upon  their  own  kind :  but,  by  Her- %0a%3c cules !  the  greatest  part  of  the  evils  that  happen  to  Men  are %0a%3c from  the  hand  of  Man  himself. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  I. %0a%3c The  wonderful  Forms  of  Nations. %0a%3c %0a%3c IN  our  reports  of  Nations  we  have  spoken  in  general  of %0a%3c the  Human  Race  spread  over  the  Face  of  the  Earth.  Neither %0a%3c is  it  our  purpose  at  present  to  describe  particularly  all  their %0a%3c numberless  Customs  and  Manners  of  Life,  which  are  as %0a%3c many  as  there  are  Assemblies  of  Men.  However,  I  think  it %0a%3c good  not  to  omit  all,  but  to  make  relation  of  some  things %0a%3c concerning  those  People  especially  who  live  furthest  from %0a%3c the  Sea;  among  whom,  I  doubt  not  but  I  shall  find  such %0a%3c matter  as  to  most  Men  will  seem  both  prodigious  and %0a%3c incredible.  For  whoever  believed  that  there  were  Ethio- %0a%3c pians before  he  saw  them?  what  is  it  that  seemeth  not  a %0a%3c Wonder  at  the  First  Sight?  how  many  things  are  judged %0a%3c impossible  before  they  are  done?  arid  the  Power  and  Ma- %0a%3c jesty of  Nature  in  every  particular  action  seemeth  incre- %0a%3c dible, if  we  consider  the  same  severally,  and  do  not  em- %0a%3c brace the  whole  at  once  in  the  Mind.  For,  to  say  nothing %0a%3c of  the  Peacocks'  Feathers,  of  the  Spots  of  Tigers  and  Pan- %0a%3c thers, of  the  Colours  that  ornament  so  many  Creatures %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 176  History  of  Nature.  [BooK  VII. %0a%3c %0a%3c besides :  let  us  come  to  one  only  point,  which  to  speak  of %0a%3c seemeth  small,  but  being  deeply  weighed,  is  a  matter  of %0a%3c exceeding  great  regard ;  and  that  is,  the  Speech  of  so %0a%3c many  Nations ;  so  many  Tongues ;  so  much  Variety  of %0a%3c Utterance,  that  a  Foreigner  seems  to  be  something  different %0a%3c from  a  Man.  Then  to  view  the  variety  that  appeareth  in %0a%3c our  Face  and  Countenance ;  although  there  be  not  more %0a%3c than  Ten  Members  or  a  few  more,  among  so  many  thousand %0a%3c of  these,  not  Two  Persons  are  to  be  found  who  are  not %0a%3c distinct  in  Likeness :  a  thing  which  no  Art  can  perform,  in %0a%3c a  small  number  out  of  so  many.  And  yet  thus  much  must %0a%3c I  advertise  my  Readers,  that  I  will  not  pawn  my  credit %0a%3c for  many  things  that  I  shall  deliver;  but  I  will  rather %0a%3c direct  them  to  the  Authors,  who  will  answer  them  in %0a%3c all  doubtful  points :  only  let  them  not  think  much  to  follow %0a%3c the  Greeks,  whose  Diligence  hath  been  greater,  and  their %0a%3c Attention  of  longer  standing. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  II. %0a%3c Of  the  Scythians,  and  the  Diversity  of  other  Nations.1 %0a%3c %0a%3c THAT  there  are  Scythians,  and  even  many  kinds  of %0a%3c them,  who  feed  ordinarily  on  Man's  Flesh,  we  have  shewn %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  The  belief  of  the  ancients  in  the  existence  of  many  anomalous  races %0a%3c of  mankind,  was  a  portion  of  the  science  of  the  age ;  and  not  to  have %0a%3c given  it  credit,  and  a  place  in  his  work,  would  have  subjected  the  author %0a%3c to  as  much  reproach  for  scepticism,  as  the  notice  he  has  taken  of  them %0a%3c has  done  for  his  alledged  credulity.  And  so  far  as  Greek  authority  ex- %0a%3c tended, the  degree  of  credit  which  Pliny  assigned  to  these  strange  races, %0a%3c appears  to  have  heen  well  founded ;  for  except  in  one  or  two  instances, %0a%3c the  errors  appear  to  have  sprung  from  misinterpretation,  rather  than %0a%3c from  a  positive  departure  from  truth.  Aristotle  is  sufficient  authority %0a%3c for  the  existence  of  a  race  of  pigmies,  who  are  also  mentioned  by  Hero- %0a%3c dotus ;  and  in  more  modern  times  that  excellent  naturalist  Belon  is  satis- %0a%3c fied concerning  them.  Nor  can  we,  even  now,  refuse  to  admit  the  possi- %0a%3c bility of  finding  their  representatives  in  the  Bushmen  still  existing  in %0a%3c Southern  Africa.  On  the  other  hand,  the  existence  of  men  of  enormous %0a%3c stature,  of  which  some  stupendous  instances  are  given  by  Pliny  (b.  vii. %0a%3c c.  xvi.),  is  attested  by  profane  as  well  as  by  sacred  history.  Thus  Pau- %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BOOK  VII.]  History  of  Nature.  177 %0a%3c %0a%3c already,  (Book  iv.  1 2 ;  vi.  1 .)  The  thing  itself  would  be  thought %0a%3c incredible,  if  we  did  not  consider  that  in  the  very  Middle  of %0a%3c the  World,  even  in  Sicily  and  Italy,  there  have  been  Nations  of %0a%3c such  Monsters,  as  the  Cyclopae  and  Lystrigonae :  and  also  very %0a%3c %0a%3c sanias  (in  his  "  Atticks,"  quoted  by  Bishop  Cumberland  in  his  translation %0a%3c of  Sanchoniatho)  says,  that  he  saw  in  the  Upper  Lydia  bones  whose %0a%3c figure  would  satisfy  any  man  that  they  were  men's  bones,  but  their  big- %0a%3c ness was  above  the  now  known  size  of  men.  He  also  mentions  the  bones %0a%3c of  Asterius,  in  the  neighbouring  country  of  the  Milesians ;  giving  the %0a%3c dimensions  of  his  body  to  be  no  less  than  ten  cubits  long,  and  that  he %0a%3c was  the  son  of  Anax ;  a  name  singularly  corresponding  with  a  race  men- %0a%3c tioned by  Moses,  and  the  sight  of  whom  terrified  and  humbled  the  Is- %0a%3c raelitish  spies.  It  is  not  a  little  strange,  as  Bishop  Cumberland  remarks, %0a%3c quoting  from  Cicero  "  de  Natura  Deorum,"  that  there  is  reason  to  believe, %0a%3c one  of  the  very  ancient  and  gigantic  persons  known  under  the  name  of %0a%3c Hercules  had  six  fingers  on  each  hand,  as  is  also  noticed  of  the  last  de- %0a%3c scendants of  this  mighty  race,  in  the  second  book  of  Samuel,  c.  xxi.  The %0a%3c tradition  that  such  enormous  people  existed  in  the  early  ages  of  the %0a%3c world  is  often  referred  to  by  Homer,  and  other  ancient  writers,  who %0a%3c drew  from  thence  the  erroneous  conclusion,  that  the  whole  human  race %0a%3c had,  since  their  day,  become  gradually  weaker  and  more  diminutive ; %0a%3c whereas,  in  the  only  authentic  history  of  these  remote  ages  it  is  clearly %0a%3c intimated,  that  this  vast  stature  was  limited  to  particular  families  or %0a%3c nations,  who  even  at  that  time  were  thought  remarkable  by  all  besides ; %0a%3c and  who  were  finally  exterminated  by  their  neighbours,  perhaps  as  the %0a%3c only  resource  against  their  violence.  The  Macrocephali,  or  long  heads, %0a%3c (mentioned  b.  vi.  c.  4)  may  be  supposed  to  have  owed  their  peculiarity  to %0a%3c the  habit  of  employing  pressure  to  mould  their  heads  in  early  infancy %0a%3c into  the  compressed  and  elevated  form,  as  is  now  practised  by  some  tribes %0a%3c on  the  continent  of  America ;  and  such  as  are  mentioned  with  exceedingly %0a%3c short  necks  may,  perhaps,  have  been  marked  only  with  a  personal  de- %0a%3c formity ;  but  the  people  with  intensely  black  skin,  to  all  of  whom,  how- %0a%3c ever otherwise  different,  the  ancients  seem  to  have  assigned  indiscrimi- %0a%3c nately the  name  of  Ethiopians,  are  judged  by  Pliny  to  display  a  more %0a%3c remarkable  phenomenon  than  all  the  strange  forms  he  has  occasion  to %0a%3c notice ;  as  we  also  should  probably  do,  if  living  instances  had  not  ren- %0a%3c dered it  common.  We  may  include  in  another  section  those  singular %0a%3c examples  of  the  human  race,  which  the  author  supposes  to  be  comprised %0a%3c in  nations,  but  which  are  more  probably  reported  as  of  rare  or  casual %0a%3c occurrence,  or  perhaps  nothing  beyond  an  accidental  monstrosity.  Such %0a%3c we  know  to  be  the  case  with  the  Albinoes,  with  white  hair  and  tender %0a%3c eyes  ;  and  perhaps  also  the  monoculous  king,  and  the  Arimaspians,  who %0a%3c are  mentioned  also  by  Herodotus,  together  with  the  other  Cyclopaean %0a%3c VOL.  n.

A  third %0a%3c section  of  these  supposed  anomalous  people  may  obviously  be  referred  to %0a%3c the  quadrumanous  tribes :  a  class  of  creatures  so  nearly  approaching  to %0a%3c the  external  form  of  humanity,  that  we  cannot  feel  surprised  if  ignorant %0a%3c travellers,  who  viewed  only  at  a  distance,  and  with  minds  prepared  to %0a%3c welcome  every  wonder  —  the  oran  outang  and  pongo  —  were  not  able  to %0a%3c discern  a  generic  difference  between  them  and  the  truly  human  race. %0a%3c Such  were  the  hairy  men  and  women  mentioned  in  the  31st  chapter  of %0a%3c this  book,  the  satyrs,  Choromandse,  and  people  with  no  noses,  or  having %0a%3c tails,  a  figure  of  the  latter  being  found  on  an  alraxis,  or  amulet,  engraved %0a%3c by  Montfau9on ;  but  through  the  whole  of  his  narrative  we  observe  that %0a%3c the  author  is  careful  to  give  his  authorities,  as  being  aware  that  what %0a%3c appeared  so  strange  must  be  made  to  rest  upon  the  credit  of  those  who %0a%3c had  originally  reported  it.  Some  of  these  instances,  indeed,  admit  of  no %0a%3c interpretation  that  we  are  able  to  afford  them ;  but  in  regard  to  one  of %0a%3c the  strangest  of  them,  Purchas  gives  the  authority  of  Fitch,  an  English- %0a%3c man :  "  I  went  from  Bengala  into  the  country  of  Couche,  not  far  from %0a%3c Cauchin  China.  The  people  have  ears  which  be  marvellous  great,  of  a %0a%3c span  long,  which  they  draw  out  in  length  by  devices  when  they  be %0a%3c young."  In  addition  to  the  strange  forms  of  men  mentioned  by  Pliny, %0a%3c Diodorus  Siculus  mentions  some  in  an  island  discovered  by  Jambulus, %0a%3c whose  bones  were  as  flexible  as  nerves  (tendons)  :  the  holes  of  their  ears %0a%3c far  wider  than  ours ;  and  with  tongues  deeply  cloven,  so  that  they  imi- %0a%3c tate the  song  of  birds,  and  can  ordinarily  speak  to  two  men  at  once. — %0a%3c Wern.

Gall, %0a%3c lib.  vi.)  says,  "  The  whole  nation  of  the  Gauls  is  much  addicted  to  reli- %0a%3c gious observances,  and  on  that  account,  those  who  are  attacked  by  any  of %0a%3c the  more  serious  diseases,  and  those  who  are  involved  in  the  danger  of %0a%3c warfare,  either  offer  human  sacrifices  or  make  a  vow  that  they  will  offer %0a%3c them,  and  they  employ  the  Druids  to  officiate  at  their  sacrifices ;  for  they %0a%3c consider  that  the  favour  of  the  immortal  gods  cannot  be  conciliated, %0a%3c unless  the  life  of  one  man  be  offered  up  for  that  of  another :  they  have  also %0a%3c sacrifices  of  the  same  kind  appointed  on  behalf  of  the  state.  Some  have %0a%3c images  of  enormous  size,  the  limbs  of  which  they  make  of  wicker-work, %0a%3c and  fill  with  living  men,  and  setting  them  on  fire,  the  men  are  destroyed %0a%3c by  the  flames." — Wern.

Above  those  other  Scythians  called  Anthropophagi, %0a%3c there  is  a  Country  named  Abarimon,  within  a  certain %0a%3c extensive  Valley  of  the  Mountain  Imaus,  in  which  are %0a%3c Wild  Men,  wandering  about  among  brute  Beasts,  and %0a%3c having  their  Feet  directed  backward  behind  the  Calves %0a%3c of  their  Legs,  but  able  to  run  very  swiftly.  This  kind %0a%3c of  Men  cannot  live  in  any  other  Climate  than  their  own, %0a%3c which  is  the  reason  that  they  cannot  be  conveyed  to  the %0a%3c Kings  that  border  upon  them ;  nor  could  they  be  brought %0a%3c to  Alexander  the  Great,  as  Beton  hath  reported,  who  was %0a%3c the  Surveyor  of  the  Journeys  of  that  Prince.

Agathar tides %0a%3c writeth,  that  in  Africa  the  Psylli,1  who  are  so  called  from %0a%3c king  Psyllus,  whose  Sepulchre  is  in  a  part  of  the  Greater %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  The  earliest  existing  reference  that  we  have  to  the  Psylli,  or  serpent- %0a%3c charmers,  is  found  in  the  58th  Psalm,  the  8th  verse  ;  and  the  art  is  yet %0a%3c practised  in  the  East.  These  men  were,  and  still  are,  distinct  tribes  in %0a%3c their  several  countries,  professing  the  power  they  claim  to  be  an  inherent %0a%3c and  natural  function.  Lucan,  in  the  5th  book  of  his  "Pharsalia,"  gives  a %0a%3c complete  exposition  of  the  ancient  belief  concerning  the  charming  of  ser- %0a%3c pents. He  chiefly  describes  the  measures  which  were  taken  to  protect %0a%3c the  Roman  camp.  When  the  encampment  was  marked  out,  the  serpent- %0a%3c charmers  marched  around  it  chanting  their  charms,  the  mystic  sounds  of %0a%3c which  chased  the  serpents  far  away.  But  not  trusting  entirely  to  this, %0a%3c fires  of  different  kinds  of  wood  were  kept  up  beyond  the  furthest  tents, %0a%3c the  smell  of  which  prevented  the  serpents  from  approaching.  Thus  the %0a%3c camp  was  protected  during  the  night.  But  if  any  soldier  when  abroad  in %0a%3c the  day  time  happened  to  be  bitten,  the  Psylli  exerted  their  power  to %0a%3c effect  a  cure.  First  they  rubbed  the  wounded  part  around  with  saliva, %0a%3c to  prevent,  as  they  said,  the  poison  from  spreading  while  they  assayed %0a%3c their  arts  to  extract  it :  — %0a%3c %0a%3c "  Then  sudden  he  begins  the  magic  song, %0a%3c %0a%3c And  rolls  the  numbers  hasty  o'er  his  tongue ; %0a%3c %0a%3c Swift  he  runs  on,  nor  pauses  once  for  breath, %0a%3c %0a%3c To  stop  the  progress  of  approaching  death ; %0a%3c %0a%3c He  fears  the  cure  might  suffer  by  delay, %0a%3c %0a%3c And  life  be  lost  but  for  a  moment's  stay. %0a%3c %0a%3c Thus  oft,  though  deep  within  the  veins  it  lies, %0a%3c %0a%3c By  magic  numbers  chased,  the  mischief  flies : %0a%3c %0a%3c But  if  it  hear  too  slow,  if  still  it  stay, %0a%3c %0a%3c And  scorn  the  potent  charmer  to  obey ; %0a%3c %0a%3c With  forceful  lips  he  fastens  on  the  wound, %0a%3c %0a%3c Drains  out  and  spits  the  venom  to  the  ground." — ROWE. %0a%3c Lane  ("Modern  Egyptian")  gives  a  particular  account  of  the  different %0a%3c methods  made  use  of  by  the  Psylli  of  the  present  day  when  exhibiting %0a%3c their  supposed  powers.  As  to  the  pretensions  of  ancient  as  well  as  mo- %0a%3c dern serpent-charmers,  of  being  in  their  own  persons  insensible  to  the %0a%3c poison  of  the  reptiles,  there  is  no  satisfactory  proof  of  it :  indeed  numerous %0a%3c instances  to  the  contrary  have  occurred ;  and  where  they  escape  unharmed, %0a%3c it  is  to  be  attributed  to  the  poison  fangs  having  been  previously  extracted, %0a%3c or  to  their  fearless  handling  of  the  deadly  creatures. — See  the  note  on %0a%3c Ps.

These  Men  had  naturally  in %0a%3c their  Bodies  a  Poison  fatal  to  Serpents,  so  that  by  the %0a%3c Smell  of  it  they  were  able  to  stupify  them.  And  by %0a%3c this  means  they  used  to  try  the  Chastity  of  their  Wives. %0a%3c For  as  soon  as  their  Children  were  born,  they  exposed %0a%3c them  to  the  most  furious  Serpents ;  for  these  would  not  fly %0a%3c from  them  if  they  were  begotten  in  Adultery.  This  Nation, %0a%3c in  general,  hath  been  almost  entirely  extirpated  by  the %0a%3c Nasamones,  who  now  inhabit  those  parts ;  but  a  kind  of %0a%3c these  Men  remaineth  still,  descended  from  those  who  fled, %0a%3c or  else  who  were  not  present  when  the  Battle  was  fought;  but %0a%3c they  exist  in  small  Companies.  In  like  manner,  the  Nation %0a%3c of  the  Marsi  continue  in  Italy,  who  preserve  the  Reputa- %0a%3c tion of  being  descended  from  a  Son  of  Circe,  and  therefore %0a%3c possess  the  same  natural  faculty.  Yet  so  it  is  that  all  Men %0a%3c possess  within  them  that  which  is  Poison  to  Serpents:  for %0a%3c it  is  reported  they  flee  from  Man's  Spittle,  as  they  do  from %0a%3c the  touch  of  Scalding  Water;  but  if  it  penetrate  into  their %0a%3c Mouth,  especially  if  it  come  from  a  Man  that  is  fasting,  it  is %0a%3c present  Death.  Beyond  the  Nasamonse,  and  their  Neigh- %0a%3c bours the  Machlyae,  there  are  Androgyni,  of  a  double  Nature, %0a%3c inter  se  vicibus  coeuntes,  as  Calliphanes  reporteth.  Aristotle %0a%3c adds,  that  their  Right  Breast  is  like  that  of  a  Man,  and  the %0a%3c Left  that  of  a  Woman.  In  the  same  Africa  Isigonus  and  Nym- %0a%3c phodorus  avouch  that  there  are  certain  Families  of  Charmers: %0a%3c who,  if  they  praise,  destroy  the  Sheep,  cause  .the  Trees  to %0a%3c wither,  and  Infants  to  pine  away  to  death.  Isigonus  addeth %0a%3c further,  that  there  are  People  of  the  same  kind  among  the  Tri- %0a%3c balli  and  Illyrii,  who  charrn  with  their  Eyesight,  and  kill  those %0a%3c whom  they  look  upon  for  a  long  time,  especially  if  their  Eyes %0a%3c look  angry  :  which  Evil  of  theirs  is  more  quickly  felt  by  those %0a%3c who  are  above  the  age  of  Puberty.  It  is  worthy  of  remark, %0a%3c that  they  have  two  Pupils  in  each  Eye.

In  such  manner  Nature,  having %0a%3c generated  in  Man  this  custom  of  Wild  Beasts,  to  feed  upon %0a%3c the  Bowels  of  Men,  hath  taken  Delight  also  to  generate %0a%3c Poisons  in  their  whole  Body,  and  even  in  the  very  Eyes  of %0a%3c some;  that  there  should  be  no  evil  in  the  whole  World,  that %0a%3c might  not  be  likewise  found  in  Man.  Not  far  from  the  City %0a%3c of  Rome,  within  the  Territory  of  the  Falisci,  there  are  a  few %0a%3c Families  called  Hirpise,  which  at  their  Yearly  Sacrifice  cele- %0a%3c brated to  Apollo  upon  the  Mount  Soracte,  walk  upon  the %0a%3c pile  of  Wood  as  it  is  on  Fire  without  being  burnt.2  On %0a%3c which  account,  by  a  perpetual  Act  of  the  Senate,  they  possess %0a%3c an  Immunity  from  War  and  all  other  Public  Services. %0a%3c Some  men  have  certain  Parts  of  their  Bodies  naturally %0a%3c working  surprising  Effects.

But  principally  India  and  the  whole  Tract  of %0a%3c Ethiopia  is  full  of  these  wonderful  Things.

The  reason  of  this %0a%3c is  the  Goodness  of  the  Soil,  the  Temperature  of  the  Air,  and %0a%3c the  Abundance  of  Water :  which  is  the  cause  also  that  under %0a%3c a  single  Fig-tree,2  if  it  can  be  believed,  Squadrons  of  Horse- %0a%3c men may  stand.  There  are  Reeds  also  of  such  Length3  that %0a%3c between  every  Joint  they  will  yield  sufficient  to  make  Boats %0a%3c able  to  receive  three  Men.

It  falleth  out,  moreover,  that  there  come %0a%3c into  the  World  Children  of  both  Sexes  in  one,  whom  we  call %0a%3c Hermaphrodites.

Cornelius  Gamma  says,  that  he  performed  it  six  times  on  as  many %0a%3c women,  and  that  the  children  were  preserved ;  but  he  says  nothing  of  the %0a%3c fate  of  the  mothers.— Wern.

Some  have %0a%3c resembled  their  Grandfathers :  and  of  Twins,  one  hath  been %0a%3c like  the  Father,  the  other  the  Mother :  but  he  that  was %0a%3c Born  a  year  after  hath  been  so  like  his  elder  Brother  as  if  he %0a%3c had  been  one  of  the  Twins.  Some  Women  bring  all  their %0a%3c Children  like  themselves ;  others  again  resembling  their %0a%3c Husbands,  and  some  like  neither  the  one  nor  the  other. %0a%3c Some  Women  bring  all  their  Daughters  like  their  Fathers, %0a%3c and  their  Sons  like  the  Mothers.  The  Example  is  undoubted, %0a%3c of  NiccBus^  a  famous  Painter  of  Byzantium,  who  having  to %0a%3c his  Mother  a  Woman  begotten  in  Adultery  by  an  Ethiopian, %0a%3c and  nothing  different  in  Colour  from  other  Women,  was %0a%3c himself  begotten  an  Ethiopian.  Indeed,  the  Consideration %0a%3c of  the  Likenesses  is  in  the  Mind ;  in  which  likewise  many %0a%3c other  Accidents  are  thought  to  be  very  strong,  whether  they %0a%3c come  by  Sight,  Hearing,  and  Memory,  or  Imaginations %0a%3c drunk  in  in  the  very  instant  of  Conception.1  The  thought  of %0a%3c either  Father  or  Mother  flying  to  and  fro  transporting  the %0a%3c Soul  in  a  moment,  is  supposed  to  stamp  this  Likeness,  or  to %0a%3c mix  it.  On  this  account  it  is  that  Men  are  more  unlike  one %0a%3c another  than  other  Creatures:  for  the  Quickness  of  the %0a%3c Thoughts,  the  Agility  of  the  Mind,  the  very  great  variety %0a%3c of  our  Dispositions,  imprint  the  great  Multiplicity  of  Marks  ; %0a%3c whereas  the  Minds  of  other  Creatures  is  immovable,  being %0a%3c alike  in  all,  and  in  every  one  according  to  its  own  Kind. %0a%3c Artenon,  a  Man  of  the  common  Rank,  was  so  like  in  all %0a%3c points  to  Antiochus  King  of  Syria,  that  Laodicl  the  Queen, %0a%3c after  Antiochus  was  killed,  effected  the  Succession  of  the %0a%3c Kingdom  through  his  acting  the  part  of  Recommendation. %0a%3c Vibius,  a  certain  Commoner  of  Rome,  and  Publicius,  one %0a%3c from  a  Bondslave  made  a  Freeman,  were  both  of  them  so %0a%3c like  Pompey  the  Great,  that  the  one  could  scarcely  be %0a%3c discerned  from  the  other :  so  closely  did  they  represent  that %0a%3c open  Countenance,  and  the  singular  Majesty  which  appeared %0a%3c in  his  Forehead.  The  like  cause  it  was  that  gave  his  Father %0a%3c also  the  Surname  of  Menogenes,  from  his  Cook  ;  although  he %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  The  reader  will  scarcely  fail  to  remember  Jacob's  singular  stratagem %0a%3c with  Laban's  flock — Genesis,  xxx.  and  xxxi. — Wern.

So  was  one %0a%3c of  the  Scipios  surnamed  Serapio  upon  such  an  occasion, %0a%3c after  the  name  of  one  Serapio,  who  was  a  base  Slave  of  his, %0a%3c and  the  dealer  in  buying  and  selling  his  Swine.  Another %0a%3c Scipio  after  him,  of  the  same  House,  was  surnamed  Salutio, %0a%3c because  of  a  certain  Jester  of  that  Name.  After  the  same %0a%3c manner  one  Spinter,  a  Player  of  the  second  Place,1  arid %0a%3c Pamphilus,  a  Player  of  the  third  Part,  resembled  Lentulus %0a%3c and  Metellus,  who  were  Consuls  together.  And  this  fell %0a%3c out  very  untowardly,  that  such  resemblances  of  the  two %0a%3c Consuls  should  be  seen  together  on  the  Stage.  On  the  other %0a%3c hand,  Rubrius  the  Player  was  surnamed  Plancus,  because %0a%3c he  was  so  like  Plancus  the  Orator.  Again,  Burbuleius  and %0a%3c Menogenes,  both  Players,  gave  name,  the  one  to  Curio  the %0a%3c Father,  as  did  the  other  to  Messala  Censorius.  There %0a%3c was  in  Sicily  a  Fisherman  who  resembled  Sura  the  Pro- %0a%3c consul, not  in  general  likeness  only,  but  also  in  the  grin %0a%3c when  he  spoke,  in  drawing  his  Tongue  short,  and  in  his %0a%3c thick  Speech.  Cassius  Severus,  the  famous  Orator,  was %0a%3c reproached  for  being  like  Mirmillo,  a  Keeper  of  Cattle. %0a%3c Toranius  sold  to  Marcus  Antonius,  at  that  time  Triumvir, %0a%3c two  very  beautiful  Boys  as  Twins,  so  like  they  were  one  to %0a%3c the  other :  although  one  was  born  in  Asia,  and  the  other %0a%3c beyond  the  Alps.  But  when  Antony  afterwards  came  to %0a%3c the  knowledge  of  the  fraud,  which  was  detected  by  the  Lan- %0a%3c guage of  the  Boys,  he  threatened  him  in  great  Anger : %0a%3c Among  other  things  complaining  of  the  high  Price  that  he %0a%3c had  made  him  pay,  for  they  cost  him  two  hundred  Sesterces. %0a%3c But  the  cunning  Merchant  answered,  That  this  was  the  very %0a%3c cause  why  he  bad  sold  them  at  so  great  a  rate  :  for  it  would %0a%3c not  have  been  so  wonderful  if  two  Brothers  of  the  same %0a%3c Mother  had  resembled  one  another ;  but  that  there  should %0a%3c be  any  found,  who  were  born  in  different  Countries,  so  like %0a%3c in  all  respects,  was  above  every  thing  deserving  of  a  high %0a%3c Price.  This  answer  of  his  produced  a  well-timed  admiration, %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  That  is,  he  who  supported  the  second  or  the  third  rate  of  characters %0a%3c on  the  ancient  stage.—  Wern.

In  Women  the  same  thing  was  counted %0a%3c inauspicious  in  the  times  of  the  Kings,  for  when  Valeria %0a%3c was  born  toothed  in  this  manner,  the  Augurs  (Aruspices) %0a%3c being  consulted  about  it,  answered  by  way  of  Prophecy, %0a%3c that  she  would  be  the  ruin  of  that  City  to  which  she  might %0a%3c be  conveyed ;  whereupon  she  was  conveyed  to  Suessa  Pometia, %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  Much  that  is  here  stated  is  erroneous,  and  mere  fable ;  the  recondite %0a%3c subject  of  generation  abounding  in  the  marvellous. —  Wern.

The  editor  is %0a%3c acquainted  with  the  fact,  that  in  an  instance  of  three  children  being  born %0a%3c at  one  birth,  all  of  them  were  furnished  with  teeth.-—  Wern.

Cornelia,  the  Mother  of  the  Grac- %0a%3c chi, is  sufficient  proof  that  it  is  an  adverse  omen,  when %0a%3c Women  are  born  with  the  Genital  Parts  grown  together. %0a%3c Some  Children  are  born  with  a  continued  edge  of  Bone %0a%3c instead  of  a  row  of  distinct  Teeth  j1  as  a  Son  of  Prusius  King %0a%3c of  the  Bythinians,  who  had  such  a  Bone  in  his  Upper  Jaw. %0a%3c But  Teeth  are  the  only  parts  that  are  not  subdued  by  the %0a%3c Fires ;  so  that  they  are  not  consumed  with  the  rest  of  the %0a%3c Body;  but  the  same  parts  that  are  not  conquered  by  the %0a%3c Flames  are  hollowed  out  and  wasted  by  a  Waterish  Rheum. %0a%3c They  may  be  made  White  by  some  Medicines.  They  are %0a%3c worn  away  by  use  ;  and  sometimes  they  fall  first  out  of  the %0a%3c Head  ;  they  serve  not  only  to  grind  our  Meat  for  our  Nourish- %0a%3c ment, but  they  are  necessary  for  the  framing  of  our  Speech. %0a%3c The  Fore-teeth  hold  the  Government  over  our  Voice  and %0a%3c Words  by  a  peculiar  accord,  answering  to  the  Stroke  of  the %0a%3c Tongue,  and  the  series  of  their  Formation,  with  their  Size, %0a%3c catting  up,  softening,  or  restraining  the  Words ;  but  when %0a%3c they  are  fallen  out  all  explanation  of  Words  is  lost. %0a%3c Moreover,  it  may  be  believed,  that  some  Augury  can  be %0a%3c gathered  from  the  Teeth.  Men  are  in  possession  of  two-and- %0a%3c thirty  in  all,  except  the  Nation  of  the  Turduli ;  and  those %0a%3c who  have  above  this  Number  suppose  that  they  may  calcu- %0a%3c late on  longer  Life.  Women  have  not  so  many :  they  that %0a%3c have  on  the  right  Side  in  the  upper  Jaw  two  Eye-teeth, %0a%3c named  Canine,  may  promise  themselves  the  Favours  of  For- %0a%3c tune ;  as  was  the  case  in  Agrippina,  the  Mother  of  Domitius %0a%3c Nero :  but  it  is  the  contrary  in  the  Left  Side.  It  is  not  the  Cus- %0a%3c tom in  any  Country  to  burn  in  a  Funeral  Fire  the  dead  Body %0a%3c of  an  Infant  before  the  Teeth  are  come  up :  but  of  this  we  will %0a%3c write  more,  when  our  History  will  take  in  the  individual %0a%3c Members.  Zoroastres  was  the  only  Man  we  have  heard  of, %0a%3c who  laughed  the  same  day  he  was  born :  his  Brain  did  so %0a%3c evidently  pulsate,  that  it  would  lift  up  the  Hand  that  was %0a%3c laid  on  it:  a  Presage  of  his  future  Learning.

This  also  is  observed  for  a  Truth,  that %0a%3c generally  all  Men  fall  short  of  the  full  Stature  in  Times  past ; %0a%3c and  seldom  are  they  taller  than  their  Fathers :  the  Exube- %0a%3c rance of  the  Seeds  being  consumed  by  the  burning,  in  the %0a%3c Changes  of  which  the  World  now  vergeth  toward  the  latter %0a%3c End.     In  Crete,  a  Mountain  being  cloven  asunder  by  an %0a%3c Earthquake,  a  Body  was  found  standing,  forty-six  Cubits %0a%3c high ;   which  some  judged  to  be  the  Body  of  Orion,  and %0a%3c others,  of  Otus.     It  is  believed  from  Records  that  the  Body %0a%3c of  Orestes,  when  taken  up  by  direction  of  the  Oracle,  was %0a%3c seven  Cubits  long.1     And  that  great  Poet,  Homer,  who  lived %0a%3c almost  a  thousand  Years  ago,  did  not  cease  to  complain  that %0a%3c Men's  Bodies  were  less  of  Stature  even  then,  than  in  old %0a%3c Time.     The  Annals  do  not  deliver  down  the  Bulk  of  Navius %0a%3c Pollio;  but  that  he  was  of  great  size  appeareth  by  this,  that %0a%3c it  was  taken  for  a  Wonder,  that  in  a  great  Crowd  of  People %0a%3c running  together  he  was  almost  killed.     The  tallest  Man %0a%3c that  hath  been  seen  in  our  Age  was  one  named  Gabbara, %0a%3c who  in  the  Days  of  Prince  Claudius  was  brought  out  of %0a%3c Arabia;  he  was  nine  Feet  high,  and  as  many  Inches.    There %0a%3c were  in  the  Time  of  Divus  Augustus  two   others,  named %0a%3c Pusio  and  Secundilla,  higher  than  Gabbara  by  half  a  Foot, %0a%3c whose  Bodies  were  preserved  for  a  Wonder  in  a  Vault  in  the %0a%3c Gardens  of  the  Salustiani.     While  the  same  (Augustus)  was %0a%3c President,  his  Niece  Julia  had  a  very  little  Man,  two  Feet %0a%3c and  a  Hand- breadth  high,  called  Canopas,  whom  she  made %0a%3c much  of;  and  also  a  Woman  named  Andromeda,*  the  Freed %0a%3c Woman  of  Julia  Augusta.     M.  Varro  reporteth  that  Manius %0a%3c Maximus,  and  M.  Tullius,  Roman  Knights,   were   but  two %0a%3c Cubits  hio;h  :  and  we  ourselves  have  seen  their  Bodies  em- %0a%3c %0a%3c \j %0a%3c %0a%3c balmed  in  Presses.     It  is  well  known  that  there  are  some %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  Ten  feet  and  an  half. %0a%3c %0a%3c 2  The  instance  of  the  American  who  exhibited  himself  through  Eu- %0a%3c rope is  of  recent  occurrence.     John  Duck,  an  Englishman,  was  carried %0a%3c about  for  a  show  in  1610,  being  two  feet  and  a  half  high  at  forty-five  years %0a%3c of  age.  Cardan  says  he  saw  a  man  in  Italy,  of  full  age,  not  above  a  cubit %0a%3c high.    He  was  carried  about  in  a  parrot- cage. — Wern.

We  find %0a%3c in  the  Chronicles,  that  in  Salamis  the  Son  of  Euthimenes1  in %0a%3c three  Years  grew  to  he  three  Cubits  high  ;  but  he  was  in %0a%3c his  Pace  slow  and  in  his  Understanding  dull ;  but  having %0a%3c attained  the  State  of  Puberty,  and  his  Voice  having  become %0a%3c strong,  at  Three  Years'  end  he  died  suddenly  of  a  Contraction %0a%3c of  all  the  Parts  of  his  Body.  Some  while  since  I  saw  myself %0a%3c the  like  in  almost  all  respects,  except  the  Puberty,  in  a  Son %0a%3c of  Cornelius  Tacitus,  a  Roman  Knight,  and  a  Procurator  for %0a%3c the  State  in  Belgic  Gaul.  Such  the  Greeks  call  Ectrapelos  ; %0a%3c in  Latin  they  have  no  Name. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  XVII. %0a%3c Observations  of  Bodies. %0a%3c %0a%3c WE  see  that  the  Length  of  a  Man  from  the  Sole  of  the %0a%3c Foot  to  the  Crown  of  the  Head  is  equal  to  the  Extent  of  his %0a%3c longest  Fingers  when  his  Arms  and  Hands  are  stretched  out. %0a%3c As  also,  that  most  People  are  stronger  on  the  right  Side ; %0a%3c others  are  as  strong  on  one  Side  as  on  the  other  :  and  there  are %0a%3c some  that  are  altogether  Left-handed;  but  that  is  never  seen %0a%3c in  Women.  Men  weigh  heavier  than  Women  :  and  in  every %0a%3c kind  of  Creature,  the  bodies,  when  dead,  are  more  heavy  than %0a%3c when  alive ;  and  the  same  Parties  sleeping  weigh  more  than %0a%3c when  awake.  The  dead  Bodies  of  Men  float  with  the  Face %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  In  the  year  1747,  Mr.  Dawkes,  a  surgeon  at  St.  Ives,  near  Hun- %0a%3c tingdon, published  a  small  tract  called  "  Prodigium  Willinghamense,"  or %0a%3c an  account  of  a  surprising  boy,  who  was  buried  at  Willingham,  near %0a%3c Cambridge,  upon  whom  he  wrote  the  following  epitaph :  —  "  Stop,  tra- %0a%3c veller, and  wondering  know,  here  buried  lie  the  remains  of  Thomas,  son %0a%3c of  Thomas  and  Margaret  Hall,  who,  not  one  year  old,  had  the  signs  of %0a%3c manhood ;  not  three,  was  almost  four  feet  high ;  endued  with  uncommon %0a%3c strength,  a  just  proportion  of  parts,  and  a  stupendous  voice;  before  six  he %0a%3c died,  as  it  were,  of  advanced  age.  He  was  born  at  this  village,  October  31, %0a%3c 1741,  and  the  same  departed  this  life,  September  3,  1747."  (See  also %0a%3c "Philosophical  Transactions,"  1744-45.)  As  Dr.  Elliotson  has  observed %0a%3c (Blumenbach's  "  Physiology  "),  this  perfectly  authentic  case  removes  all %0a%3c doubts  respecting  the  boy  at  Salamis  mentioned  by  Pliny. — Wern.

They  are  known  by  the  Signs,  that %0a%3c they  never  feel  Thirst,  nor  put  forth  any  Sweat :  and  yet  we %0a%3c know  that  a  Man  may  conquer  his  Thirst  by  his  Will ;  and %0a%3c Julius  Viator,  a  Roman  Knight,  descended  from  the  Race  of %0a%3c the  Confederate  Voconti,  in  his  younger  Years  being  ill  with %0a%3c an  Effusion  of  Water  beneath  the  Skin,  and  forbidden  by %0a%3c the  Physicians  to  use  Fluids  in  any  way,  obtained  a  Nature %0a%3c by  Custom,  so  that  in  his  old  Age  he  forbore  to  drink. %0a%3c Others  also  have  been  able  to  command  their  Nature  in %0a%3c many  Cases. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  XIX. %0a%3c Examples  of  Diversity  of  Habits. %0a%3c %0a%3c IT  is  said,  that  Crassus,  Grandfather  to  that  Crassus  who %0a%3c was  slain  in  Parthia,  never  laughed,  and  on  that  account %0a%3c was  called  Agelastus:  and  also  that  many  have  been  found %0a%3c to  have  never  wept.  Socrates,  who  was  illustrious  for  his %0a%3c Wisdom,  was  seen  always  to  carry  the  same  Countenance, %0a%3c never  being  more  cheerful  nor  more  disturbed  at  one  Time %0a%3c than  another.  But  this  tendency  of  the  Mind  turneth  now %0a%3c and  then  in  the  End  into  a  certain  Rigour  and  Sternness %0a%3c of  Nature,  so  hard  and  inflexible  that  it  cannot  be  ruled ; %0a%3c and  so  despoileth  Men  of  the  humane  Affections;  and  such %0a%3c are  called  by  the  Greeks  Apathes.  who  had  the  Experience %0a%3c of  many  such  :  and,  what  is  surprising,  some  of  them  were %0a%3c very  eminent  for  Wisdom,  as  Diogenes  the  Cynic,  Pyrrho, %0a%3c Heraclitus,  and  Timo ;  the  latter  being  carried  away  so  far %0a%3c as  to  hate  the  whole  Human  Race.  But  these  were  Ex- %0a%3c amples of  depraved  Nature.  Various  remarkable  Things  are %0a%3c known  ;  as  in  Antonia,  the  Wife  of  Drusus,  who  was  never %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BOOK  VII.]  History  of  Nature.  203 %0a%3c %0a%3c seen  to  spit ;  and  Pomponius  the  Poet,  a  Consular  Man,  who %0a%3c never  belched.  Such  as  naturally  have  their  Bones  solid, %0a%3c who  are  seldom  met  with,  are  called  Cornel  (hard  as  Horn). %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  XX. %0a%3c Of  Strength  and  Swiftness.1 %0a%3c %0a%3c VARRO,  in  his  Treatise  of  prodigious  Strength,  maketh %0a%3c Report  of  Tritanus,  who  was  little  in  Person,  but  of  incom- %0a%3c parable Strength,  much  renowned  in  the  Gladiatorial  Play, %0a%3c with  the  Armature  of  the  Samnites.  He  maketh  mention %0a%3c also  of  a  Son  of  his,  a  Soldier  under  Pompey  the  Great ;  and %0a%3c that  he  had  all  over  his  Body,  as  well  as  through  his  Arms %0a%3c and  Hands,  Sinews  running  straight  and  across  like  Net- %0a%3c work :  and  when  an  Enemy  challenged  him  to  a  Combat, %0a%3c he  overcame  him  with  his  right  Hand  unarmed,  and  in  the %0a%3c End  caught  hold  of  him,  and  brought  him  into  the  Camp %0a%3c with  one  Finger.  Junius  Valens,  a  Centurion  in  the  Praeto- %0a%3c rium  of  Divus  Augustus,  was  accustomed  to  bear  up  Waggons %0a%3c laden  with  Sacks,  until  they  were  discharged :  with  one  Hand %0a%3c he  would  hold  back  a  Chariot,  standing  firm  against  all  the %0a%3c Force  of  the  Horses.  He  did  also  other  wonderful  Things, %0a%3c which  are  to  be  seen  engraved  on  his  Tomb :  and  therefore %0a%3c Varro  saith  that  being  called  Hercules  Rusticellus,  he  took %0a%3c up  his  Mule  and  carried  him  away.  Fusius  Salvius  carried %0a%3c up  over  the  Stairs  two  hundred  Pounds'  weight  on  his  Feet, %0a%3c as  many  in  his  Hands,  and  twice  as  much  upon  his  Shoul- %0a%3c ders.

And  a  Man  may %0a%3c wonder  the  more  at  this  Matter,  if  he  consider,  that  it  was %0a%3c counted  an  exceeding  great  Journey  that  Tiberius  Nero  made %0a%3c in  three  Chariots  in  a  Day  and  a  Night,  when  he  hasted  to %0a%3c his  Brother  Drusus,  then  lying  sick  in  Germany,  which  was %0a%3c but  200  Miles.2 %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  Two  persons,  successively  porters  to  Kings  James  I.  and  Charles, %0a%3c his  son,  were  of  great  size  and  strength.    The  first,  particularly,  was  able %0a%3c to  take  two  of  the  tallest  yeomen  of  the  guard,  one  under  each  arm,  and %0a%3c he  ordered  them  as  he  pleased.     The  Emperor  Maximinus,  who  was  eight %0a%3c feet  and  a  half  in  height,  was  of  enormous  strength,  even  in  proportion  to %0a%3c his  magnitude.  —  Wern.  Club, %0a%3c %0a%3c 2  We  have  less  examples  of  swiftness  of  foot,  since  more  rapid  convey- %0a%3c ance is  common.  Pliny's  instances  are  the  more  surprising,  as  they  imply %0a%3c continuance ;  but  the  English  King  Henry  V.  was  so  swift  of  foot,  that %0a%3c with  two  of  his  lords,  without  any  weapons,  he  would  catch  a  wild  buck %0a%3c in  a  large  park.    In  Baker's  "  Chronicle "  we  are  informed,  that  John %0a%3c Lepton,  of  Kepwick,  in  the  county  of  York,  one  of  the  grooms  of  the %0a%3c Privy  Chamber  to  James  I.,  for  a  wager  rode  for  six  days  successively %0a%3c between  York  and  London :  which  is  150  miles.     He  accomplished  the %0a%3c work  of  each  day,  beginning  May  20,  1606,  before  it  was  dark  ;  and  hav- %0a%3c ing finished  his  wager  at  York  on  Saturday,  on  the  following  Monday  he %0a%3c rode  back  to  London,  and  on  Tuesday  to  the  court  at  Greenwich  :  being %0a%3c as  fresh  and  well  as  when  he  began.    In  the  year  1619,  July  17,  Bernard %0a%3c Calvert  rode  from  St.  George's  church,  in  Southwark,  to  Dover  :  thence %0a%3c by  barge  to  Calais,  and  from  thence  back  to  St.  George's  church,  on  the %0a%3c same  day;  beginning  at  three  o'clock  in  the  morning,  and  ending  at  eight %0a%3c in  the  evening,  fresh  and  lusty,  although  roads  were  then  less  perfect %0a%3c than  now.  —  Wern.

Cicero  hath  recorded,  that  the  Poem %0a%3c of  Homer  called  the  Iliad,  written  on  Parchment,  was  en- %0a%3c closed within  a  Nutshell.  The  same  Writer  maketh  mention %0a%3c of  one  who  could  see  to  the  Distance  of  135  Miles.  And %0a%3c M.Varro  nameth  the  Man,  saying  that  he  was  called  Strabo; %0a%3c and  that  during  the  Carthaginian  War  he  was  accustomed  to %0a%3c stand  upon  Lilybseum,  a  Promontory  of  Sicily,  and  discover %0a%3c the  Fleet  coming  out  of  the  Harbour  of  Carthage ;  he  was %0a%3c also  able  to  tell  even  the  Number  of  the  Ships.  Collier ates %0a%3c made  Emmets,  and  other  equally  small  Creatures,  out  of %0a%3c Ivory,  so  that  other  Men  could  not  discern  the  Parts  of  their %0a%3c Bodies.  A  certain  Myrmecides  was  excellent  in  that  kind  of %0a%3c Workmanship ;  who  of  the  same  Material  carved  a  Chariot %0a%3c with  four  Wheels,  which  a  Fly  might  cover  with  her  Wings. %0a%3c Also  he  made  a  Ship  that  a  little  Bee  might  hide  with  her %0a%3c Wings.1 %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  XXII. %0a%3c Of  Hearing. %0a%3c %0a%3c OF  Hearing  there  is  one  Example  which  is  wonderful : %0a%3c that  the  Battle  in  which  Sybaris  was  destroyed  was  heard  at %0a%3c Olympia  on  the  very  same  Day  it  was  fought.  For  the  Cim- %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  Peculiarities  of  eyesight  are  also  recorded  in  ancient  authors.  The %0a%3c Emperor  Tiberius  was  able  to  see  better  than  other  men  by  night ;  and %0a%3c contrary  to  the  usual  habit,  best  when  he  first  opened  his  eyes  from  sleep. %0a%3c Such  was  also  the  case  with  the  philosopher  Cardan.  Fabricius  ab  Aqua- %0a%3c pendente  knew  a  man  who  could  see  well  by  night,  but  not  by  day ;  and %0a%3c the  Editor  was  acquainted  with  two  brothers,  whose  vision  was  of  this %0a%3c kind ;  and  it  may  be  accounted  for  by  the  fact,  that  they  were  destitute  of %0a%3c eyebrows,  and  had  very  little  eyelashes. —  Wern.

The  most  illustrious  among  Women  is %0a%3c the  Example  of  Leana  the  Courtesan,  who,  when  she  was %0a%3c tortured,  did  not  betray  Harmodius  and  Aristogiton,  who %0a%3c slew  the  Tyrant.  Among  Men  is  the  Example  of  Anaxar- %0a%3c chus,  who,  being  tortured  for  a  like  Cause,  bit  off  his  Tongue %0a%3c with  his  Teeth,  and  spat  his  only  Hope  of  Discovery  into  the %0a%3c Face  of  the  Tyrant. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  XXIV. %0a%3c Examples  of  Memory.1 %0a%3c %0a%3c MEMORY  is  the  greatest  Gift  of  Nature,  and  most  neces- %0a%3c sary of  all  others  for  Life  ;  it  is  hard  to  say  who  deserved  the %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  The  orator  Hortensius  was  famous  for  an  extensive  and  accurate %0a%3c memory ;  which  Cicero  speaks  of  with  admiration.  It  is  said  of  him, %0a%3c that  once  sitting  at  a  place  where  things  were  exposed  to  public  sale  for  a %0a%3c whole  day,  he  recited  in  order  all  the  things  that  had  been  sold,  their %0a%3c price,  and  the  names  of  the  buyers ;  and  it  was  afterwards  found  that  he %0a%3c was  minutely  correct.  Cicero,  comparing  him  with  Lucullus,  says,  that %0a%3c Hortensius's  memory  was  greater  for  words,  and  that  of  Lucullus  for %0a%3c things, — an  important  distinction,  for  it  is  commonly  found  that  those  who %0a%3c best  remember  the  one,  are  deficient  in  the  other.  Seneca  had  a  remark- %0a%3c able memory  for  words ;  so  that  he  was  able  to  repeat  two  thousand  names %0a%3c in  the  order  they  were  pronounced.  The  art  of  memory,  to  which  some %0a%3c moderns  have  made  great  pretensions,  is  very  ancient ;  and  it  was  much %0a%3c in  use  in  the  middle  ages.  But  it  applies  to  words  rather  than  things  ; %0a%3c and  it  requires  to  be  studied  as  an  individual  object,  and  not  as  means  to %0a%3c an  end.— Wern.

King  Cyrus  called  every  Soldier  in  his  Army %0a%3c by  his  own  Name.  L.  Scipio  could  do  the  like  by  all  the %0a%3c Citizens  of  Rome.  Cineas,  Ambassador  of  King  Pyrrhus, %0a%3c the  next  Day  after  he  came  to  Rome,  saluted  by  Name  the %0a%3c Senate  and  Equestrian  Order.  Mithridates,  the  King  of  two- %0a%3c and-twenty  Nations  of  different  Languages,  ministered  Justice %0a%3c to  them  in  that  Number  of  Tongues :  and  when  he  made  a %0a%3c Speech  in  the  public  Assembly  respectively  to  every  Nation,  he %0a%3c performed  it  without  an  Interpreter.  A  certain  Charmidas^ %0a%3c a  Grecian,  rehearsed  as  if  he  was  reading  whatever  any  Man %0a%3c would  call  for  out  of  any  of  the  Volumes  in  the  Libraries. %0a%3c At  length  the  Practice  of  this  was  reduced  into  an  Art  of %0a%3c Memory,  which  was  invented  by  Simonides  Melicus,  and %0a%3c afterwards  brought  to  Perfection  by  Metrodorus  Scepsius;  by %0a%3c which  a  Man  might  learn  to  rehearse  the  same  Words  of  any %0a%3c Discourse  after  once  hearing.  And  yet  there  is  nothing  in %0a%3c Man  so  frail ;  for  it  is  injured  by  Diseases,  Accidents,  and  by %0a%3c Fear,  sometimes  in  part,  and  at  other  Times  entirely.  One %0a%3c who  was  struck  with  a  Stone  forgot  his  Letters  only.  Ano- %0a%3c ther, by  a  Fall  from  the  Roof  of  a  very  high  House,  lost %0a%3c the  Remembrance  of  his  own  Mother,  his  near  Relations, %0a%3c and  Neighbours.  Another  when  sick  forgot  his  own  Ser- %0a%3c vants ;  and  Messala  Corvinus,  the  Orator,  forgot  even  his %0a%3c own  Name.2  So  also  it  often  endeavoureth  to  lose  itself,  even %0a%3c while  the  Body  is  otherwise  quiet  and  in  Health.

We  are  told  that  Curio,  the  orator,  was  much  given  to %0a%3c this ;  so  that,  offering  to  divide  a  subject  into  three  heads,  he  would  forget %0a%3c one  of  them,  or  perhaps  make  four.   He  was  to  plead  on  behalf  of  Sextus %0a%3c Naevius,  opposed  to  Cicero,  who  was  on  the  side  of  Titania  Corta ;  when %0a%3c he  suddenly  forgot  the  whole  cause,  and  ascribed  the  fact  to  the  witchcraft %0a%3c of  Titania.  —  Wern.

I  speak  not  now  of  his  Courage %0a%3c and  Constancy,  nor  of  his  lofty  Understanding  of  all  Things %0a%3c under  the  Expanse  of  Heaven  ;  but  of  that  proper  Strength %0a%3c and  Quickness  of  his,  as  active  as  the  very  Fire.  We  have %0a%3c heard  it  reported  of  him,  that  he  was  accustomed  to  write %0a%3c and  read  at  one  Time,  to  dictate  and  hear.  He  would  dic- %0a%3c tate Letters  of  the  utmost  Importance  to  four  Secretaries  at %0a%3c once :  and  when  he  was  free  from  other  Business,  he  would %0a%3c dictate  seven  Letters  at  one  Time.  The  same  Man  fought %0a%3c fifty  Battles  with  Banners  displayed :  in  which  Point  he %0a%3c alone  exceeded  M.  Marcellus,  who  fought  thirty-nine  Battles. %0a%3c For,  besides  his  Victories  in  the  Civil  Wars,  he  slew  in  Battle %0a%3c 1,192,000  of  his  Enemies  ;  but  this,  for  my  own  Part,  I  hold %0a%3c no  special  Glory  of  his,  considering  the  great  Injury  so  in- %0a%3c flicted on  Mankind  :  and  this,  indeed,  he  hath  himself  con- %0a%3c fessed, by  avoiding  to  set  down  the  Slaughter  that  occurred %0a%3c during  the  Civil  Wars.  Pompey  the  Great  deserveth  honour %0a%3c more  justly  for  taking  from  the  Pirates  846  Sail  of  Ships. %0a%3c But  what  is  proper  and  peculiar  to  Ccesar,  besides  what  is %0a%3c said  above,  was  his  remarkable  Clemency,  in  which  he  so  far %0a%3c surpassed  all  others,  that  he  himself  regretted  it.

But  herein %0a%3c appeared  the  true  and  incomparable  Loftiness  of  his  un- %0a%3c conquered  Mind,  that  when  at  the  Battle  of  Pharsalia,  the %0a%3c Writing-case  containing  the  Letters  of  Pompey  was  taken, %0a%3c as  also  those  of  Scipio  at  Thapsus,  he  burnt  them  all  with %0a%3c the  utmost  Fidelity,  without  having  read  them. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Pompey. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  XXVI. %0a%3c The  Praise  of  Pompey  the  Great. %0a%3c %0a%3c To  relate  all  the  Titles,  Victories,  and  Triumphs  of  Pompey %0a%3c the  Great,  wherein  he  was  equal  in  the  splendour  of  his %0a%3c Exploits  not  only  to  Alexander  the  Great,1  but  even  almost %0a%3c to  Hercules  and  Liber  Pater,  would  redound,  not  to  the %0a%3c Honour  only  of  that  one  Man,  but  also  to  the  Grandeur  of %0a%3c the  Roman  Empire.  In  the  first  place  then,  after  he  had %0a%3c recovered  Sicily,  from  whence  his  first  rising  was  as  a  follower %0a%3c of  Sylla  in  the  cause  of  the  Republic,  he  appeared  auspiciously %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  It  is  clear  from  various  ancient  authorities,  that  it  was  the  ambition %0a%3c of  Pompey  to  imitate  and  be  compared  to  Alexander;  and  it  was  with  this %0a%3c view  that  the  title  of  Great  was  highly  acceptable  to  him.  It  was  per- %0a%3c haps to  humour  this  foible,  and  through  it  to  secure  him  the  more  effec- %0a%3c tually  to  his  party,  that  Sylla  was  accustomed  to  pay  him  extraordinary %0a%3c personal  honours :  returning  his  salutation  of  Imperator  with  the  same %0a%3c title,  rising  from  his  seat  to  salute  him  when  Pompey  dismounted  from %0a%3c his  horse,  and  uncovering  his  head  at  the  same  time. — Daleschampiiis. %0a%3c In  honour  of  Pompey 's  having  restored  the  sovereignty  of  the  sea,  the %0a%3c reverse  of  a  Roman  denarius  bears  the  figure  of  a  Dolphin  and  Eagle, %0a%3c separated  by  a  Sceptre,  with  the  inscription,  Magn.

Having  also  wholly  subdued  Africa,  and  brought %0a%3c it  under  obedience,  he  was  brought  back  in  a  Triumphal %0a%3c Chariot,  with  the  name  of  Great,  by  reason  of  the  Pillage %0a%3c there  captured,  being  then  only  a  Roman  Knight :  a  thing %0a%3c that  was  never  seen  before.  Immediately  passing  into  the %0a%3c West,  and  having  brought  under  obedience  876  Towns, %0a%3c between  the  Alps  and  the  borders  of  Spain,  he  erected %0a%3c Trophies  on  the  Pyrenees,  with  the  inscription  of  his  Victory  ; %0a%3c and  with  more  nobleness  of  Mind,  said  nothing  concerning %0a%3c Sertorius.

But  Cato,1  the  First  of  the  Porcian  House, %0a%3c was  thought  to  have  been  the  most  excellent  in  three %0a%3c things  which  are  in  the  highest  degree  commendable  in %0a%3c Man.  He  was  the  best  Orator;  the  best  General ;  and  the %0a%3c best  Senator.

But %0a%3c if  you  seek  for  one  especial  thing  in  Cato,  this  is,  that  he %0a%3c was  judicially  called  to  his  answer  Forty-four  times,  and %0a%3c never  was  there  a  Man  accused  oftener  than  he ;  yet  he  was %0a%3c always  acquitted. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  XXVIII. %0a%3c %0a%3c Of  Valour. %0a%3c IT  is  a  very  extensive  inquiry,  to  discover  in  whom  the %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  This  Cato  appears  to  have  been  more  successful  in  obtaining  the %0a%3c esteem  than  the  love  of  the  people ;  and,  indeed,  from  the  evidence  of  his %0a%3c "Treatise  on  Agriculture,"  he  appears  to  have  been  a  niggardly  and %0a%3c shrewd  master,  whom  no  one  could  defraud,  and  who  was  ready  to %0a%3c secure  every  advantage  in  a  bargain.  He  recommends,  with  the  same %0a%3c indifference,  the  sale  of  an  ox  that  was  past  labour,  his  rusty  iron,  and %0a%3c sickly  or  worn-out  slave. %0a%3c %0a%3c Narratur  et  prisci  Catonis, %0a%3c %0a%3c Saepe  mero  caluisse  Virtus. — Wern.

Ennius %0a%3c had  in  greatest  admiration  T.  Ccecilius  Teucer,  and  his %0a%3c brother;  and  in  regard  of  those  Two  he  added  to  the  others %0a%3c the  Sixth  Book  of  his  Annals.  But  L.  Siccius  Dentatus,  a %0a%3c Tribune  of  the  Commons,  not  long  after  the  Banishment  of %0a%3c the  Kings,  when  Sp.  Tarpeius  and  A.  JEternius  were  Con- %0a%3c suls, by  most  Voices  surpasseth  in  this  kind,  having  Fought %0a%3c 120  Battles;  having  been  Conqueror  in  Eight  Combats  with %0a%3c a  Challenge ;  being  marked  with  45  Scars  on  the  front %0a%3c of  his  Body,  and  none  behind.  Also  he  won  the  Spoils  of %0a%3c 33  Enemies;  he  had  been  presented  with  18  Spears;  25 %0a%3c trappings  for  Horses ;  83  Chains ;  160  Bracelets ;  26 %0a%3c Crowns,  of  which  14  were  Civic,  eight  of  Gold :  three %0a%3c Mural ;  and  one  Obsidional ;  together  with  a  Pension  from %0a%3c the  Treasury ;  and  ten  Captives  with  twenty  Oxen ;  and %0a%3c thus  he  followed  nine  Imperators,  who  chiefly  by  his  means %0a%3c triumphed.  Besides  these  things,  he  accused  in  open  court %0a%3c before  the  body  of  the  People,  which  I  suppose  was  the %0a%3c worthiest  act  he  ever  did,  T.  Romulius,  one  of  the  lead- %0a%3c ing Generals  (who  had  been  a  Consul)  and  convicted  him  for %0a%3c his  ill  management  of  his  military  command.  Scarcely %0a%3c inferior  to  these  were  the  exploits  of  Manlius  Capitolinus,  if %0a%3c he  had  not  forfeited  them  again  with  such  an  end  of  his  life.1 %0a%3c Before  he  was  seventeen  years  of  age,  he  had  gained  two %0a%3c spoils  of  his  Enemies.  He  was  the  first  Roman  Knight  that %0a%3c received  a  Mural  Crown;  with  six  Civic  Crowns  ;  37  Dona- %0a%3c tions; and  he  carried  the  Scars  in  the  forepart  of  his  Body %0a%3c of  33  Wounds.  He  rescued  P.  Servilius,  Master  of  the %0a%3c Horse,  and  (in  the  rescue)  was  himself  wounded  in  the  Arm %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  Marcus  Manlius  was  the  means  of  preserving  the  Capitol  when  it  was %0a%3c nearly  taken  by  the  Gauls ;  from  which  exploit  he  obtained  the  surname %0a%3c of  Capitolinus.  Becoming  afterwards  a  warm  supporter  of  the  popular %0a%3c party  against  the  patrician  order,  he  was  accused  of  aiming  at  the  kingly %0a%3c power,  and  condemned  to  death.  According  to  Livy  (lib.  vi.)  "the %0a%3c tribunes  cast  him  down  from  the  Tarpeian  rock ;  thus  the  same  spot,  in %0a%3c the  case  of  one  man,  became  a  monument  of  distinguished  glory  and  of %0a%3c the  cruellest  punishment." —  Wern.

Above  all  other  actions,  he  alone  saved  the %0a%3c Capitol,  and  thereby  the  whole  State,  from  the  Gauls:  if  he %0a%3c had  not  saved  it  for  his  own  Kingdom  !  In  these  examples %0a%3c there  is  indeed  much  of  courage,  but  yet  Fortune  hath  had  the %0a%3c greater  share ;  and  in  my  judgment  no  one  may  justly  prefer %0a%3c any  Man  before  M.  Sergius,  although  Catiline,  his  Nephew's %0a%3c Son,  discredited  his  Name.  In  the  second  Year  of  his  Service %0a%3c he  lost  his  Right  Hand  ;  and  in  two  Services  he  was  wounded %0a%3c three  and  twenty  times :  by  which  means  he  had  little  use %0a%3c of  either  his  Hands  or  Feet.  But  although  thus  disabled %0a%3c as  a  Soldier,  he  went  many  a  Time  after  to  the  Wars, %0a%3c attended  only  by  one  Slave.  Twice  he  was  taken  Prisoner %0a%3c by  Hannibal  (for  he  did  not  serve  against  ordinary  Enemies), %0a%3c and  twice  he  escaped  from  his  bonds,  although  for  twenty %0a%3c Months  he  was  every  Day  kept  Bound  with  Chains  or %0a%3c Shackles.  Four  times  he  fought  with  his  Left  Hand  only, %0a%3c until  two  Horses  were  killed  under  him.  He  made  himself %0a%3c a  Right  Hand  of  Iron,  and  he  fought  with  it  fastened  to  his %0a%3c Arm.  He  delivered  Cremona  from  Siege,  and  saved  Pla- %0a%3c centia.  In  Gallia,  he  took  twelve  Camps  of  the  Enemies: %0a%3c All  which  Exploits  appear  from  that  Oration  of  his  which  he %0a%3c made  in  his  Praetorship,  when  his  Colleagues  repelled  him %0a%3c from  the  solemn  Sacrifices  because  he  was  maimed.1  What %0a%3c heaps  of  Crowns  would  he  have  built  up  if  he  had  been %0a%3c matched  with  any  other  Enemy  !  For  it  is  very  important, %0a%3c in  our  estimate  of  Courage,  to  consider  in  what  Time  the %0a%3c Persons  lived.  For  what  Civic  Crowns  yielded  either  Trebia %0a%3c and  Ticinus,  or  Thrasymenus?  what  Crown  could  have  been %0a%3c gained  at  Cannae,  where  the  best  service  of  Courage  was  to %0a%3c have  made  an  escape  ?  Others,  truly,  have  vanquished  Men  ; %0a%3c but  Sergius  conquered  Fortune  herself. %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  The  ancients  were  cautious  not  to  admit  a  mutilated  person  to  the %0a%3c celebration  of  sacred  rites,  observing  that  such  a  defect  was  to  be  regarded %0a%3c as  a  thing  of  ill-omen  ;  and  that,  if  the  victim  must  be  perfect,  how  much %0a%3c more  does  it  become  the  priest  to  be  so !

Unless  perhaps %0a%3c we  agree  that  Homer,  the  Greek  Prophet,  excelled  all  others, %0a%3c considering  either  the  subject  matter  or  the  happy  fortune %0a%3c of  his  Work.  And  therefore  Alexander  the  Great  (for  in  so %0a%3c proud  a  decision  I  shall  cite  the  Judgment  of  the  highest, %0a%3c and  of  those  that  are  beyond  Envy),  having  found  among %0a%3c the  Spoils  of  Darius,  king  of  the  Persians,  his  Casket  of %0a%3c sweet  Ointments,  which  was  richly  embellished  with  Gold, %0a%3c Pearls,  and  precious  Stones  ;  when  his  friends  shewed  him %0a%3c many  uses  to  which  the  Cabinet  might  be  put,  considering %0a%3c that  Alexander,  as  a  Soldier  engaged  in  War,  and  soiled  with %0a%3c its  service,  was  disgusted  with  those  Unguents  :  By  Hercules, %0a%3c he  said,  let  it  be  devoted  to  the  care  of  Homer's  Books,  that %0a%3c the  most  precious  Work  of  the  Human  Mind  should  be  pre- %0a%3c served in  the  richest  of  all  Caskets.  The  same  Prince,  when %0a%3c he  took  Thebes,  commanded  that  the  Dwelling-house  and %0a%3c Family  of  the  Poet  Pindar*  should  be  spared.  He  refounded %0a%3c the  native  place  (Patria)  of  Aristotle  the  Philosopher;  and %0a%3c so  mingled  a  kind  Testimony  for  one  who  threw  light  on %0a%3c all  things  in  the  World.  Apollo,  at  Delphi,  revealed  the %0a%3c murderers  of  Archilochus  the  Poet.  When  Sophocles,  the %0a%3c Prince  of  the  Tragic  Buskin,  was  dead,  and  the  Walls  of %0a%3c the  City  were  besieged  by  the  Lacedaemonians,  Liber  Pater %0a%3c commanded  that  he  should  be  buried  ;  and  he  admonished %0a%3c Lysander  their  King  several  times  as  he  slept,  to  suffer  his %0a%3c delight  to  be  interred.  The  King  made  diligent  inquiry  who %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  "  The  Macedonian  conqueror  bade  spare %0a%3c %0a%3c The  house  of  Pindarus,  when  temple  and  tower %0a%3c Went  to  the  ground." — MII/TON. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BOOK  VII.]  History  of  Nature.  215 %0a%3c %0a%3c lately  had  died  in  Athens :  and  by  relation  of  the  Citizens %0a%3c soon  found  out  who  the  god  had  signified ;  and  so  gave  them %0a%3c peace  for  the  burial. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  XXX. %0a%3c Of  Plato,  Ennius,  Virgil,  M.  Varro,  and  M.  Cicero. %0a%3c %0a%3c DIONYSIUS  the  Tyrant,  born  otherwise  to  pride  and %0a%3c cruelty,  sent  out  to  meet  Plato,  the  Chief  of  the  Wise %0a%3c Men,  a  Ship  adorned  with  Ribbons;  and  himself  went  out %0a%3c in  a  Chariot  with  four  white  Horses,  to  receive  him  on  the %0a%3c Shore.  Isocrates  sold  one  Oration  for  twenty  talents  of  Gold. %0a%3c JEschines,  the  famous  Orator  of  Athens,  having  at  Rhodes %0a%3c rehearsed  that  accusation  which  he  had  made  against %0a%3c Demosthenes,  read  also  his  adversary's  defence,  by  occasion %0a%3c of  which  he  had  been  driven  into  Banishment  at  Rhodes ; %0a%3c and  when  the  Rhodians  wondered  at  it  he  said,  How  much %0a%3c more  would  you  have  wondered,  if  you  had  heard  him  de- %0a%3c livering it  himself!  Yielding  thus  in  his  Calamity  a  noble %0a%3c Testimony  to  his  Adversary.  The  Athenians  exiled  Thucy- %0a%3c dides  their  General :  but  after  he  had  written  his  Chronicle %0a%3c they  called  him  home  again,  wondering  at  the  Eloquence  of %0a%3c the  Man  whose  Courage  they  had  condemned.  The  Kings %0a%3c of  Egypt  and  Macedonia  gave  a  strong  Testimony  how  much %0a%3c they  honoured  Mcenander  the  Comic  Poet,  in  that  they %0a%3c sent  Ambassadors  for  him  with  a  Fleet ;  but  he  won  himself %0a%3c greater  fame  by  esteeming  more  his  Studies,  than  the  Favours %0a%3c of  Princes.  Also  the  Roman  Nobles  have  afforded  Testi- %0a%3c monies even  to  Foreigners.  Hence  Cn.  Pompey,  when  he  had %0a%3c ended  the  War  against  Mithridates,  being  about  to  enter  the %0a%3c House  of  Posidonius,  the  celebrated  Professor  of  Wisdom, %0a%3c forbad  the  Lictor  to  knock  at  the  Door  according  to  custom  : %0a%3c and  he  to  whom  both  the  East  and  the  West  parts  of  the %0a%3c World  had  submitted,  laid  down  the  lictorial  Fasces  at  the %0a%3c Gate.

His  decision  was, %0a%3c that  by  any  means  all  Greeks  should  be  expelled  from  Italy ; %0a%3c but  his  nephew's  Son,  (Pronepos,)  Cato  of  Utica,  brought  one %0a%3c of  their  Philosophers  over  with  him  from  the  Tribunes  of  the %0a%3c Soldiers,  and  another  from  the  Cyprian  Embassy.  And  it  is %0a%3c worthy  of  notice  to  consider  how  the  same  Language  was  regard- %0a%3c ed by  these  two  Catoes :  for  by  the  one  it  was  rejected.  But %0a%3c let  us  now  discern  the  glory  of  our  own  Countrymen.  Scipio %0a%3c Africanus  the  elder  gave  order  that  the  Statue  of  Q.  Ennius* %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  The  account  of  Gate's  conduct  with  the  Greek   ambassadors,  as %0a%3c given  by  Pliny,  is  very  different  from  that  by  Plutarch,  and,  from %0a%3c Cato's  acknowledged  love  of  eloquence,  we  may  judge  more  correct.     It %0a%3c was  not,  therefore,  the  fear  that  eloquence  would  render  the  Romans %0a%3c effeminate ;  but  because  the  peculiar  eloquence  of  these  men,  with  per- %0a%3c haps the  general  tendency  of  Greek  studies,  was  calculated  to  foster %0a%3c habits  of  sophistry,  and  so  confound  the  distinction  between  truth  and %0a%3c falsehood.—  Wern.

"  It  was  well  known  from  a  passage %0a%3c in  Cicero,  and  another  in  Livy,  that  the  sepulchre  of  the  Scipios  stood %0a%3c beyond  the  Porta  Capena  of  Rome  ;  and  Livy  describes  it  as  being  in  his %0a%3c time  surmounted  by  three  statues :  two  of  them  of  the  Scipios,  and  the %0a%3c third,  as  was  believed,  of  the  poet  Ennius.     But  it  was  not  until  the  year %0a%3c A.D.  1780,  that  some  labourers  at  work  in  a  vineyard  discovered  a  clue %0a%3c which  led  to  further  excavations;  and  thus  the  tombs,  after  having  lain %0a%3c undisturbed  for  upwards  of  2000  years,  were  most  unexpectedly  brought %0a%3c to  light.     The  original  inscriptions  have  been  removed  to  the  Vatican." %0a%3c The  following  is  from  "  Roma  Antica,"  but  is  also  contained  in  Mont- %0a%3c faucon's  "Antiquities,"  and  it  must  belong  to  that  Scipio  who  is  spoken  of %0a%3c by  Pliny  in  the  thirty-fourth  chapter  of  this  book,  though  our  author %0a%3c has  erred  in  the  application :  — %0a%3c %0a%3c Hone  .  oino  .  ploirume  .  consentient  .

Varro,  even  while  he  lived :  a  thing  of  as %0a%3c great  honour,  in  my  opinion  (considering  that  among  the %0a%3c multitude  of  learned  Men  he  only  received  this  Crown  from  a %0a%3c Citizen  and  an  excellent  Orator),  as  that  other  Naval  Crown %0a%3c gained  him,  which  Pompey  the  Great  bestowed  upon  him %0a%3c %0a%3c Thus  interpreted : — %0a%3c %0a%3c Hunc  umirn  plurimi  consentiunt  Romae, %0a%3c %0a%3c Bonorum  optimum  fuisse  virum, %0a%3c %0a%3c Lucium  Scipionem,  films  Barbati, %0a%3c %0a%3c Consol,  Censor,  .^Edilis,  Hie  fuit ;  atque  (or,  apud  vos, %0a%3c %0a%3c or  ad  eos). %0a%3c %0a%3c Hie  cepit  Corsicam,  Aleriamque  urbem %0a%3c Dedit  Tempestatibus  sedem  merito. %0a%3c %0a%3c "  The  Roman  people  agree  in  thinking  this  man,  Lucius  Scipio,  the %0a%3c best  of  all  good  citizens.

There %0a%3c was  a  young  Woman  of  humble  Condition  among  the  com- %0a%3c mon People,  and  therefore  of  no  account,  who  lately  had  been %0a%3c in  Childbed,  and  whose  Mother  was  shut  up  in  Prison  for %0a%3c some  great  Offence ;  and  when  this  Daughter  obtained  leave %0a%3c to  have  Access  to  her  Mother,  and  constantly  by  the  Jailer %0a%3c was  narrowly  searched,  that  she  might  not  bring  to  her  any %0a%3c Food,  she  was  at  last  detected  suckling  her  with  the  Milk %0a%3c of  her  Breasts.  On  account  of  this  astonishing  circum- %0a%3c stance the  Life  of  the  Mother  was  granted  to  the  Piety  of %0a%3c the  Daughter,  and  both  of  them  had  continued  Sustenance %0a%3c allowed  them ;  and  the  Place  where  this  happened  was  con- %0a%3c secrated to  this  Deity  (Piety} :  so  that  when  C.  Quintius  and %0a%3c M.  Acilius  were  Consuls,  the  Temple  of  Piety  was  built,  in %0a%3c the  very  Place  where  this  Prison  stood,  and  where  now %0a%3c standeth  the  Theatre  ofMarcellus.

Club. %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  In  the  language  of  the  ancients,  piety  is  not  to  be  understood  as %0a%3c having  a  reference  to  God,  but  only  as  expressing  the  law  of  social  kind- %0a%3c ness among  the  relations  of  blood  or  marriage.  It  proceeds  only  from %0a%3c revelation  that  the  latter  is  made  to  be  a  duty  flowing  from  the  former ; %0a%3c and  hence,  while  among  Heathens  the  most  vicious  of  mankind  in  his %0a%3c general  character  might  also  be  among  the  most  pious,  among  Christians %0a%3c no  such  anomalies  can  exist.  —  Wern.

In  Astrology,  Berosus  was %0a%3c eminent ;  to  whom  the  Athenians,  for  his  divine  Predictions, %0a%3c caused  a  Statue  with  a  golden  Tongue  to  be  erected  in  the %0a%3c public  Gymnasium.  In  Grammar,  Apollodorus  was  distin- %0a%3c guished; and  therefore  he  was  highly  honoured  by  the  Am- %0a%3c phitryons  of  Greece.  In  Medicine,  Hippocrates1  excelled  ; %0a%3c and  having  foretold  a  Pestilence  that  was  approaching  from %0a%3c Illyria,  to  cure  it  he  sent  his  Disciples  to  the  surrounding %0a%3c Cities.

But  of  what  is  properly %0a%3c denominated  science  they  knew  little ;  and  the  Chevalier  Bunsen  re- %0a%3c marks, that  they  did  not  reverence  or  recognise  human  rights  in  any %0a%3c nation  beside  their  own.  The  love  of  knowledge  and  truth  for  their  own %0a%3c sakes  was  altogether  unknown  among  them,  and  they  never  conferred %0a%3c benefit  except  for  their  own  advantage.  Their  calculating  self-love  made %0a%3c them,  essentially,  beneficial  rulers ;  but  they  manifested  no  esteem  for  their %0a%3c subjects ;  and  we  may  add,  that  the  most  probable  motive  which  actuated %0a%3c Plutarch  in  writing  his  "  Lives,"  and  especially  for  arranging  them  in %0a%3c parallels,  was  to  shew  covertly  that  men,  as  great  in  all  respects  as  any %0a%3c Romans,  had  lived  in  Greece.  Germanicus  is  judged  to  have  been  an %0a%3c exception  to  this  Roman  constitution  of  mind ;  and  probably  there  were %0a%3c others  of  lower  rank ;  but  they  are  to  be  regarded  as  simply  the  exceptions %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BOOK  VII.]  History  of  Nature.  225 %0a%3c %0a%3c their  highest  Advantage  in  one  Thing,  others  in  another;1 %0a%3c and  every  one  rneasureth  it  according  to  his  several  Dispo- %0a%3c sition :  but  if  we  wish  to  form  a  correct  Judgment,  throwing %0a%3c aside  all  the  Ambition  of  Fortune,  it  may  be  concluded,  that %0a%3c there  is  not  a  Man  in  the  World  to  be  accounted  happy.  Arid, %0a%3c therefore,  Fortune  dealeth  liberally  and  indulgently  with  any %0a%3c one,  if  he  may  justly  be  called  not  unhappy  ;  because  if  there %0a%3c be  no  other  Things,  yet  surely  a  Man  may  be  ever  in  Fear %0a%3c lest  Fortune  should  grow  tired  of  him  :  but  let  him  admit %0a%3c this  Fear,  and  there  can  be  no  solid  Happiness.  What %0a%3c should  I  say,  moreover,  to  this  ?  —  that  no  Man  is  at  all  Times %0a%3c wise?  I  wish  that  this  were  false,  and  not,  in  the  Judgment %0a%3c of  most  Men,  a  Poet's  Word  only.  But  such  is  the  Folly  of %0a%3c mortal  Men,  that  they  are  very  ingenious  in  deceiving  them- %0a%3c selves :  so  that  they  reckon  after  the  Custom  of  the  Thra- %0a%3c cians,  who,  by  Stones  marked  with  different  Colours,  which %0a%3c they  cast  into  an  Urn,  institute  the  Trial  of  every  Day  ;  and %0a%3c at  their  last  Day  they  separate  these  Stones  one  from  an- %0a%3c other and  count  them  :  and  thus  give  Judgment  concerning %0a%3c %0a%3c to  the  general  rule.     It  is  in  the  spirit  of  Pliny's  remark  that  Martial %0a%3c begins  his  Epigram  to  Trajan,  lib.  xii.  ep.  8  :  — %0a%3c %0a%3c "  Terrarum  Dea,  gentiumque  Roma, %0a%3c Cui  par  est  nihil,  et  nihil  secundum." %0a%3c %0a%3c Goddess  of  lands  and  nations,  Rome, %0a%3c %0a%3c Nothing  to  which  can  equal  come, %0a%3c %0a%3c And  nothing  second.

The  result  was  the  same  as  is  expressed %0a%3c by  Pliny,  but  with  the  advantage  on  the  side  of  the  Hebrew  sage,  that %0a%3c he  was  able  to  find  in  his  more  elevated  principles  a  security  of  which %0a%3c Pliny  was  altogether  ignorant.  The  value  of  the  Life  and  Immortality %0a%3c which  have  been  brought  to  light  by  the  Gospel,  can  best  be  estimated %0a%3c when  we  see  the  gloom  which  occupied  the  mind  of  even  such  a  man  as %0a%3c Pliny  without  it.

Metellus,  and  L.  Sylla. %0a%3c %0a%3c M.  FIDUSTIUS,  a  Senator,  having  been  Proscribed  by %0a%3c Sylla,  was  preserved  for  six-and-thirty  Years;  but  he  was %0a%3c afterwards  Proscribed  the  second  time :  for  he  outlived  Sylla %0a%3c and  continued  to  the  time  of  Antony ;  and  it  so  happened %0a%3c that  by  him  he  was  Proscribed  again,  for  no  other  reason %0a%3c but  because  he  had  been  so  before.  Fortune  was  pleased %0a%3c that  P.  Ventidius  alone  should  triumph  over  the  Parthians  : %0a%3c but  she  had  led  him,  while  a  Boy,  in  the  Asculan  triumph  of %0a%3c Cn.  Pompeius  Strabo  ;  although  Massurius  testifieth,  that  he %0a%3c was  so  led  in  triumph  twice.  Cicero  saith,1  that  he  was  at %0a%3c first  but  a  Muleteer  to  serve  the  Camp  with  Meal.  Many %0a%3c others  affirm  that  in  his  Youth  he  was  a  poor  Soldier,  and %0a%3c served  as  a  Footman  in  his  Caliga  (or  Military  Foot  Clothing). %0a%3c Balbus  Cornelius  was  also  the  Senior  Consul  :  but  he  had %0a%3c been  judicially  accused,  delivered  over  to  the  Counsel  of  the %0a%3c Judges,  so  that  the  right  of  the  Rods2  was  on  him.  But  this %0a%3c Man  was  the  first  Roman  Consul  of  Foreigners,  arid  even  of %0a%3c those  born  within  the  Ocean ;  having  attained  to  that  Dig- %0a%3c nity, which  our  Forefathers  denied  to  Latium.  Among  the  dis- %0a%3c tinguished is  L.  Fulvius,  who  was  Consul  of  the  rebellious  Tus- %0a%3c culans  ;  but  when  he  had  passed  over  to  the  Romans,  he  was %0a%3c presently  by  the  whole  People  advanced  to  the  same  Honour %0a%3c among  them :  and  he  was  the  only  Man  who  triumphed  at %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  Epist.  x.  18. %0a%3c %0a%3c 2  This  "right"  was  according  to  a  law  whose  origin  is  disputed;  but %0a%3c it  seems  to  have  been  ancient.    According  to  Dalechampius'  note  on  the %0a%3c passage,  no  Roman  citizen  could  be  sentenced  by  the  magistrate  to  the %0a%3c rods,  or  be  put  to  death,  for  any  other  crime  than  murder;  and  of %0a%3c the  latter  it  was  necessary  that  he  should  be  regularly  convicted.     But  it %0a%3c would  appear  that  he  might  be  condemned  to  exile  with  little  ceremony. %0a%3c Before  the  passing  of  this  law,  a  Roman  citizen,  as  well  as  a  foreigner,  if %0a%3c sentenced  to  death,  was  scourged  as  a  matter  of  course  previous  to  the %0a%3c execution  of  the  higher  sentence.     The  tendency  of  this  law  to  confer %0a%3c protection  is  seen  in  the  instance  of  St.  Paul,  Acts  of  the  Apostles,  xvi.  37, %0a%3c and  xxii.  25.— Wern,  Club. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 228  History  of  Nature.

Sylla  was  the  only  Man,  until  our  time,  that  challenged %0a%3c to  himself  the  surname  of  Felix?  or  the  Fortunate ;  but  the %0a%3c Title  was  adopted  from  shedding  the  Blood  of  Citizens,  and %0a%3c by  waging  War  against  his  Country.

For  were  not  they  more  blessed,  who  then %0a%3c lost  their  Lives,  whose  Death  at  this  day  we  pity,  than  SyUa, %0a%3c whom  no  Man  living  at  this  day  doth  not  abhor  ?  More- %0a%3c over, was  not  his  end  more  cruel  than  the  misery  of  all  those %0a%3c who  were  Proscribed  by  him  ?  for  his  own  wretched  Body %0a%3c consumed  itself,2  and  bred  its  own  torment.  And  although %0a%3c we  may  believe  that  he  dissembled  all  this  by  his  last  Dream,3 %0a%3c wherein  he  lay  as  if  he  were  dead,  upon  which  he  gave  out %0a%3c this  Speech,  that  himself  alone  had  overcome  Envy  by  Glory  ; %0a%3c yet  in  this  one  thing  he  confessed,  that  his  Felicity  was %0a%3c defective,  inasmuch  as  he  had  not  Consecrated  the  Capitol. %0a%3c Q.

Appian  says  that  there  existed  in  front  of  the  Rostra %0a%3c in  Rome,  a  golden  equestrian  figure  of  Sylla,  with  the  inscription, %0a%3c "  Syllse  Imperat.  fortunate."  But  from  Pliny  we  learn  that  his  cruelty %0a%3c had  caused  his  memory  to  be  held  in  little  estimation  by  posterity. — %0a%3c Wern.  Club. %0a%3c %0a%3c 3  The  cause  of  the  death  of  Sylla  is  not  quite  certain.  Appian  (De %0a%3c Bell.  Civ.  i.  105)  says  he  died  of  an  attack  of  fever ;  while  others  inform %0a%3c us  that  the  loathsome  disease  called  phthiriasis  was  the  cause  of  his  death. %0a%3c Of  this  latter  opinion  were  Plutarch,  Pliny,  and  Pausanias. — Went.

He  further  acquaints  us,  that  his  son,  who %0a%3c died  a  little  before  Metella,  appeared  to  him  in  a  dream,  dressed  in  a %0a%3c mean  garment,  and  desired  him  to  bid  adieu  to  his  cares,  and  go  along %0a%3c with  him  to  his  mother  Metella,  with  whom  he  should  live  at  ease,  and %0a%3c enjoy  the  charms  of  tranquillity.—  Wern.

That  these  perfections  fell  to  him,  and %0a%3c to  none  but  him  since  the  Foundation  of  Rome,  it  were  long %0a%3c and   useless  now  to  confute  :  but  it  is  abundantly  answered %0a%3c by  one  instance ;  for  this  same  Metellus  became  Blind  in  his %0a%3c old  Age ;  having  lost  his  Eyes  in  a  Fire,  when  he  would  have %0a%3c saved   the  Palladium1  out  of  the  Temple  of  Vesta:  an  act %0a%3c worthy  of  being  remembered ;  but  the  event  was  unhappy. %0a%3c In  regard  of  which  it  is  not  proper  to  term  him  Unfortunate %0a%3c (Infelix);  and  yet  he  cannot  be  called   Fortunate  (Felix). %0a%3c The  People  of  Rome  granted  to  him  a  Privilege,  which  no %0a%3c Man  before  him  in  the  World  was  known  to  have:  that  he %0a%3c should  be  conveyed  in  a  Chariot  to  the  Senate-house  as  often %0a%3c as  he  went  to  sit  at  the  Council:  a  great  and  elevated  Pre- %0a%3c rogative, but  it  was  allowed  him  as  a  Compensation  for  his %0a%3c Eyes. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  XLIV. %0a%3c %0a%3c Of  anothtr  Metellus. %0a%3c %0a%3c A  SON  likewise  of  this  Q.

And  yet  in  the %0a%3c very  flower  of  these  Honours,  as  he  was  returning  from  the %0a%3c Field,  about  Noon-day,  he  was  seized  by  Catinius  Labeo, %0a%3c surnamed  Macerio,  a  Tribune  of  the  Commons,  whom  he  by %0a%3c virtue  of  his  Censorship  had  expelled  out  of  the  Senate  ;  and %0a%3c the  Forum  of  the  Capitol  being  empty,  he  took  him  away  by %0a%3c force  to  the  Tarpeian  Rock,  with  an  intention  to  cast  him %0a%3c down  headlong.  A  number  came  running  about  him  of  that %0a%3c company  which  called  him  Father;  but,  as  was  unavoidable %0a%3c in  so  sudden  a  case,  slowly,  and  as  if  attending  a  Funeral ; %0a%3c with  the  absence  also  of  a  right  to  make  Resistance,  and %0a%3c repel  the  inviolable  Authority  :  so  that  he  was  likely  to  have %0a%3c Perished  even  for  his  Virtue  and  faithful  Execution  of  his %0a%3c Censorship,  if  there  had  not  been  one  Tribune  found,  with %0a%3c much  difficulty,  to  step  between  and  oppose  himself;  by %0a%3c which  means  he  was  rescued,  even  from  the  utmost  point  of %0a%3c Death.  He  lived  afterwards  by  the  liberality  of  other %0a%3c Men  :  for  all  his  Goods  from  that  day  forward  were  devoted, %0a%3c from  his  Condemnation  :  as  if  he  had  not  suffered  Punish- %0a%3c ment enough  to  have  his  Neck  so  writhed,  as  that  the  Blood %0a%3c was  squeezed  out  at  his  Ears.  And  truly  I  would  reckon  it %0a%3c among  his  Calamities,  that  he  was  an  Enemy  to  the  later %0a%3c Africanus,  even  by  the  Testimony  of  Macedonians  himself. %0a%3c These  were  his  words  to  his  Children :  Go,  my  Sons,  and %0a%3c do  honour  to  his  Obsequies ;  for  the  Funeral  of  a  greater %0a%3c Citizen  ye  will  never  see.  And  this  he  said  to  them,  when %0a%3c they  had  conquered  Crete  and  the  Balearic  Islands,  and  had %0a%3c worn  the  Diadem  in  triumph  :  being  himself  already  entitled %0a%3c Macedonians.  But  if  we  consider  that  only  injury  offered  to %0a%3c him,  who  can  justly  deem  him  happy,  being  exposed  to  the %0a%3c pleasure  of  his  Enemy,  far  inferior  to  Africanus,  and  so  to %0a%3c come  to  confusion  ?

And  this %0a%3c Outrage  was  the  greater  in  regard  of  the  Felicity  which %0a%3c ensued  ;  considering  that  this  Macedonians  was  in  danger  to %0a%3c have  lost  so  great  an  Honour  as  this  solemn  and  stately %0a%3c Sepulture,  in  which  he  was  carried  forth  to  his  Funeral  Fire %0a%3c by  his  triumphant  Children,  as  if  he  had  triumphed  again  at %0a%3c his  very  burial.

This  Aglaus  was  a  Man  somewhat  advanced %0a%3c in  Years,  dwelling  in  a  very  narrow  corner  of  Arcadia, %0a%3c where  he  had  a  little  Estate,  which  himself  cultivated  ;  and %0a%3c it  was  sufficient  with  its  yearly  Produce  to  Support  him %0a%3c plentifully  ;  out  of  it  he  never  went :  so  that  (as  appeared  by %0a%3c his  course  of  Life,)  as  he  coveted  very  little,  so  he  expe- %0a%3c rienced as  little  Trouble  while  he  Lived. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  XLV1I. %0a%3c %0a%3c Whom,  while  Living,  they  ordered  to  be  Worshipped %0a%3c as  a  God.1 %0a%3c %0a%3c BY  the  appointment  of  the  same  Oracle,  arid  by  the %0a%3c approbation  of  Jupiter ,  the  Sovereign  of  the  Gods,  Euthymus %0a%3c the  Wrestler,  who  always  was  Conqueror  at  Olympia,  except %0a%3c once,  was  Consecrated  a  God  while  he  lived,  and  knew  of  it ; %0a%3c he  was  born  at  Locri,  in  Italy,  where  one  Statue  of  his,  as %0a%3c also  another  at  Olympia,  were  both  on  one  Day  struck  with %0a%3c Lightning :  which  I  see  CaUimachus  wondered  at,  as  if %0a%3c nothing  else  were  worthy  of  Admiration ;  and  gave  order %0a%3c that  he  should  be  Sacrificed  to,  as  to  a  God  :  which  was  per- %0a%3c formed accordingly,  both  while  he  Lived  and  after  he  was %0a%3c Dead.  A  thing  that  I  wonder  at  more  than  at  any  thing %0a%3c else :  that  the  Gods  should  have  been  pleased  with  such %0a%3c a  thing. %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  It  was  scarcely  more  reasonable  to  worship  a  man  after  he  was  dead %0a%3c than  during  his  life ;  and  yet  Pliny  must  have  joined  in  the  worship  of %0a%3c Augustus  and  Julius  Caesar,  and  have  been  conscious,  as  appears  from %0a%3c several  places  of  his  writings,  that  the  greatest  gods  of  his  country  had %0a%3c formerly  been  living  men.  The  egregious  vanity  of  desiring  to  be  sup- %0a%3c posed a  god  was  felt  by  Alexander  the  Great,  to  whose  application  for %0a%3c recognition  in  this  character  the  Lacedaemonians  replied  by  an  edict,  that %0a%3c "  If  Alexander  wished  to  be  a  god,  he  might  be  a  god."  Pliny  lived  to %0a%3c see  the  brother  of  his  patron  Titus,  Domitian,  exemplify  the  absurdity  of %0a%3c which  he  complains ;  for  it  appears  that  the  latter  emperor  was  more  than %0a%3c ordinarily  fond  of  this  assumption  of  divinity.—  Wem.

Hesiod, %0a%3c the  first  Writer  who  has  treated  on  this  Subject,  in  his  Fabu- %0a%3c lous Discourse  (as  I  regard  it),  embracing  many  things  about %0a%3c the  Age  of  Man,  saith  that  a  Crow  lives  nine  times  as  long %0a%3c as  we ;  the  Stags  four  times  as  long  as  the  Crow ;  and  the %0a%3c Ravens  thrice  as  long  as  they.  And  his  other  remarks  about %0a%3c the  Nymphs  and  the  Phoenix  are  still  more  Fabulous.  Ana- %0a%3c creon  the  Poet,  assigneth  to  Arganthonius,  King  of  the %0a%3c Tartessi,  150  Years  :  and  to  Cyniras,  King  of  the  Cypri,  ten %0a%3c Years  longer  :  to  JEgimius,  200.  Theopompus  affirmeth,  that %0a%3c Epimenides,  the  Gnossian,  died  when  he  was  157  Years  old. %0a%3c Hellanicus  hath  Written,  that  among  the  Epii,  in  ^Etolia, %0a%3c there  are  some  who  continue  full  200  Years :  and  with  him %0a%3c agreeth  Damastes ;  adding  also,  that  there  was  one  Pic- %0a%3c tor  eus  among  them,  a  Man  of  exceeding  Stature,  and  very %0a%3c Strong,  who  lived  even  to  300  Years.  Ephorus  saith,  that %0a%3c the  Kings  of  Arcadia  usually  lived  to  300  Years.  Alexander %0a%3c Cornelius  writeth  of  one  Dando  in  Illyrica,  who  lived  500 %0a%3c Years.  Xenophon  in  his  "  Periplus,"  maketh  mention  of  a %0a%3c King  of  a  People  upon  the  Sea-coasts,  who  lived  600  Years : %0a%3c and  as  if  he  had  not  lied  enough  already,  he  saith,  that  his %0a%3c Son  came  to  800.  All  these  strange  reports  proceed  from %0a%3c ignorance  of  the  times  past,  for  some  reckoned  the  Summer %0a%3c for  one  Year,  and  the  Winter  for  another.  Others  reckoned %0a%3c every  Quarter  for  a  Year,  as  the  Arcadians,  whose  Year  was %0a%3c but  three  Months.  Some,  as  the  Egyptians,  count  every %0a%3c change  of  the  Moon  for  a  Year ;  and  therefore  some  of  them %0a%3c are  reported  to  have  lived  1000  Years.  But  to  pass  to %0a%3c things  acknowledged  as  true,  it  is  almost  certain,  that  Argan- %0a%3c thonius,  King  of  Calais,  reigned  80  Years  ;  and  it  is  supposed %0a%3c that  he  was  40  Years  old  when  he  began  to  Reign.  It  is %0a%3c undoubted,  that  Masanissa  reigned  60  Years ;  and  also  that %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BOOK  VII.]  History  of  Nature.  235 %0a%3c %0a%3c Gorgias  the  Sicilian  lived  108  Years.

Where,  by  the  way,  one  thing  cometh  to  my  Mind %0a%3c worth  the  noting :  that  there  was  one  Space  of  five  Years, %0a%3c and  never  but  one,  in  which  not  one  Senator  died  ;  and  that %0a%3c was  from  the  time  that  Flaccus  and  Albinus  the  Censors %0a%3c finished  their  Lustrum,  to  the  comma:  in  of  the  next  Censors  ; %0a%3c which  was  from  the  Year  after  the  Foundation  of  the  City, %0a%3c 579.

But  that  Pliny's  mode  of  interpreting  it,  by  a  peculiar %0a%3c method  of  explaining  the  length  of  the  year,  will  not  apply  to  the  narra- %0a%3c tive in  the  Book  of  Genesis,  appears  from  the  fact  that  the  same  history %0a%3c records  the  reduction  of  the  length  of  human  life,  by  sudden  transitions, %0a%3c to  at  last  threescore  and  ten  years,  which  we  are  compelled  to  measure %0a%3c by  the  same  scale  as  the  former. %0a%3c %0a%3c As  a  general  summary  of  the  duration  of  life  in  historical  times,  the %0a%3c "  History  of  Life  and  Death,"  by  Lord  Bacon,  may  be  consulted.

Again,  the  Sect  of  Ascle- %0a%3c piades1  affirm,  that  the  appointed  Length  of  Life  proceedeth %0a%3c from  the  Stars  ;  but  concerning  the  utmost  term,  it  is  uncer- %0a%3c tain.

But  here,  first,  the %0a%3c Uncertainty  of  the  Art  itself  declaret.li  how  doubtful  this %0a%3c matter  is.  To  this  are  added  the  Observations  and  Instances %0a%3c of  the  very  recent  Census,  which  within  the  Space  of  four %0a%3c Years,  the  Imperators,  Caesars,  Vespasian?,  Father  and %0a%3c Son,  Censors,  have  accomplished.  And  here  we  need  not %0a%3c search  every  Cupboard,  we  will  only  set  down  the  examples %0a%3c of  the  middle  part,  between  the  Apennine  and  the  Po.  At %0a%3c Parma,  three  Men  were  found  of  the  Age  of  a  hundred  and %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  In  book  xxvi.  c.  3,  Pliny  gives  a  more  precise,  and  not  very  com- %0a%3c plimentary, account  of  this  physician. —  Wern.  Club. %0a%3c %0a%3c 2  A  large  portion  of  the  physiological  learning  of  ancient  physicians %0a%3c consisted  in  the  arithmetical  calculation  of  types  and  periods  of  vital  and %0a%3c diseased  actipns ;  in  connexion  with  which  they  also  arranged  the  motions %0a%3c of  the  celestial  bodies  and  their  influences.     It  thus  became  necessary, %0a%3c that  he  who  was  a  physician  in  the  modern  meaning  of  the  word  should %0a%3c also  be  able  to  interpret  the  stars,  and  to  apply  mathematical  reasoning %0a%3c to   the  laws   of  health  and  disease.     The   calculation  of  climacterical %0a%3c years,  and  the  ultimate  duration  of  human  life,  were  thus  decided  by  a %0a%3c combination  of  intricate  mathematical  probabilities.     These  climacteric %0a%3c years  were  formed  on  the  multiplication  of  the  number  seven  by  the %0a%3c unit  numbers,  and  at  them  the  most  important  of  the  periodic  changes %0a%3c of  the  body  were  accomplished.     The  highest  number  thus  multiplied %0a%3c formed  the  grand  climacteric,  after  which  the  changes  produced  a  retro- %0a%3c gression towards  feebleness  and  decay ;  the  danger  of  which  was  ever %0a%3c greatest  at  the  climacterics.

This  gift  of  Nature,  truly,  what- %0a%3c ever is  bestowed  on  us,  is  frail  and  uncertain  :  and  in  those %0a%3c in  whom  it  exists  in  the  largest  Measure,  it  is  but  short  and %0a%3c evil  if  we  consider  the  whole  Course  of  it  from  Beginning  to %0a%3c End.  Because  if  we  count  our  repose  by  Night,  a  Man %0a%3c may  be  truly  said  to  live  but  one  half  of  his  Life ;  for  that %0a%3c Half  of  it  which  is  spent  in  Sleep  may  be  compared  to  Death  ; %0a%3c and  if  he  cannot  Sleep,  it  is  a  Punishment.

And  it  is %0a%3c some  sort  of  Disease  to  die  through  wisdom,  for  Nature %0a%3c hath  set  down  certain  Laws,  even  to  Diseases ;  as  that  the %0a%3c circle  of  a  Quartan  Fever  never  beginneth  in  the  shortest %0a%3c Days  of  the  Year,  neither  in  the  Months  of  Winter ;  that %0a%3c some  Diseases  are  not  incident  to  those  that  are  above  Sixty %0a%3c Years  of  Age  ;  that  others  again  pass  away  when  young %0a%3c People  come  to  the  Age  of  Puberty  ;  and  especially  this  is %0a%3c observed  in  young  Women.  Old  People  are  the  least  liable %0a%3c to  take  the  Plague.  Also  there  are  Sicknesses  that  follow %0a%3c particular  Regions,  affecting  the  Inhabitants  generally %0a%3c therein.  There  are  some  again  that  take  hold  of  Servants %0a%3c only  ;  others  touch  the  highest  Persons  alone  :  and  so  from %0a%3c degree  to  degree.

And  whilst  there  are %0a%3c innumerable  Signs  that  presage  Death,  there  is  not  one  that %0a%3c can  assure  a  Man  certainly  of  Life  and  Health.  For  Cato1 %0a%3c the  Censor,  writing  to  his  Son  concerning  robust  Health, %0a%3c hath  delivered  from  some  Oracle,  that  Youth  resembling %0a%3c Age  is  a  Sign  of  untimely  Death.  Diseases  are  so  innu- %0a%3c merable, that  Pherecydes,  of  the  Island  of  Syros,  died  of  a %0a%3c great  quantity  of  Creepers2  bursting  out  of  his  Body.  Some %0a%3c are  never  free  of  a  Fever,  as  C.  Meccenas.  The  same  Man, %0a%3c for  three  whole  Years  before  he  died,  never  was  asleep  for %0a%3c a  single  Minute.  Antipater  Sidonius  the  Poet,  once  a  year %0a%3c during  his  Life  was  seized  with  an  Ague-fit  upon  his  Birth- %0a%3c day only,  and  at  last  he  died  in  such  a  Fit  in  a  good %0a%3c old  Age. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  LII. %0a%3c %0a%3c Of  such  as  were  carried  forth  to  their  Funeral  and  revived %0a%3c %0a%3c again. %0a%3c %0a%3c A.  VIOLA,  who  had  been  Consul,  came  to  himself  when %0a%3c he  was  on  the  Funeral  Pile ;  but  because  the  Flame  was  so %0a%3c Strong  that  he  could  not  be  got  away,  he  was  burnt  alive. %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  Cato's  knowledge  of  medical  subjects  may  be  judged  of  from  the %0a%3c specimens  of  miserable  quackery  contained  in  his  "  Treatise  on  Agricul- %0a%3c ture."     Much  of  it  consisted  of  charms,  in  unintelligible  jargon. — %0a%3c Wern.

For  the  same  reason  another %0a%3c author  speaks  of  the  same  creatures  under  the  name  of  animalia  tetra,  or %0a%3c foul  creatures.     It  was  the  disease  which  afflicted  Herod,  Acts  of  the %0a%3c Apostles,  xii.  23 ;    and  in  modern  times  Dr.  Heberden  records  a  case, %0a%3c "  Commentaries,"  c.

That  C.  ^Elius  Tubero,  who  had  been %0a%3c Praetor,  was  brought  Alive  again  from  the  Funeral  Fire, %0a%3c Messala  Rufus  and  many  others  assert.  Such  is  the  condi- %0a%3c tion of  Mortal  Men  ;  and  to  this  kind  of  Fortune,  and  such %0a%3c as  this,  are  we  born  :  so  that  in  the  case  of  Man  there  is %0a%3c no  assurance,  no,  not  even  in  his  Death.  We  read  in %0a%3c Chronicles,  that  the  Soul  of  Hermotimus  Clazomenius  was %0a%3c accustomed  to  leave  his  Body,  and  wandering  to  a  great %0a%3c distance,  brought  him  backs  News  of  such  things  as  could %0a%3c not  possibly  have  been  known  unless  it  had  been  present %0a%3c there  ;  and  all  the  while  his  Body  lay  half  Dead.  This %0a%3c manner  he  continued,  until  the  Cantharidae,  who  were  his %0a%3c Enemies,  took  his  Body  and  burnt  it  to  Ashes ;  and  by  that %0a%3c means  disappointed  his  Soul  when  it  came  back  again  to %0a%3c its  Sheath.  Also  it  is  said,  that  the  Spirit  of  Aristceas  in %0a%3c Proconnesus  was  seen  to  fly  out  of  his  Mouth  in  the  form %0a%3c of  a  Raven ;  and  many  an  empty  Tale  folio  we  th  thereon  : %0a%3c for  surely  I  take  it  to  be  no  better  than  a  Fable,  which  is  in %0a%3c like  manner  reported  of  Epimenides  the  Gnossian,  that  when %0a%3c he  was  a  Boy,  and  wearied  with  Heat  and  Travel,  he  laid %0a%3c himself  down  in  a  Cave,  and  there  slept  for  57  Years.1  At %0a%3c length  he  awoke,  as  if  on  the  very  next  Morning,  and  won- %0a%3c dered at  the  changed  face  of  every  thing  he  saw.  Hence  in  an %0a%3c equal  number  of  Days  after,  he  grew  Old,  that  at  last  he  lived %0a%3c to  the  Age  of  175  Years.  Women,  by  reason  of  their  Sex,  are %0a%3c most  subject  to  this  danger,2  by  the  turning  of  the  Womb  ; %0a%3c which,  if  it  be  corrected,  they  soon  recover.  To  this  belongs %0a%3c that  noble  Volume  among  the  Greeks  written  by  Heraclides, %0a%3c where  he  writeth  of  a  Woman  that  for  seven  Days  lay  as %0a%3c Dead,  but  who  in  the  end  was  restored  to  Life.  Also  Varro %0a%3c reporteth,  that  when  the  twenty  Men  were  dividing  Lands %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  Gibbon  refers  to  a  similar  story,  which  was  widely  believed,  in  the %0a%3c fifth  century  of  Christianity  ("  Decline  and  Fall,"  c.  xxxiii.) ;  but  he  seems %0a%3c not  to  have  been  aware  of  this  more  ancient,  and  perhaps  original,  narra- %0a%3c tive of  a  similar  event. —  Wern.

Also,  that  the  like  happened  at %0a%3c Aquinum.  Likewise,  that  in  Rome  one  Corfidius,  who  had %0a%3c married  his  own  Aunt  by  the  Mother's  side,  after  his %0a%3c Funeral  had  been  set  in  order,  revived  again ;  and  the %0a%3c Orderer  of  his  Funeral  was  by  him  carried  out  to  the %0a%3c same.  Varro  also  addeth  some  surprising  things,  which %0a%3c are  worth  the  rehearsal  at  large.  There  were  two  Brethren %0a%3c of  the  Equestrian  order,  of  whom  the  elder,  named  Corfidius, %0a%3c happened  in  all  appearance  to  die;  and  when  his  last  Will %0a%3c was  opened,  the  younger  Brother,  who  was  appointed  his %0a%3c Heir,  gave  orders  for  his  Funeral.  In  the  meanwhile  the %0a%3c Man  that  seemed  Dead,  by  clapping  one  Hand  against  the %0a%3c other,1  raised  the  Servants  in  the  House ;  and  he  recounted %0a%3c to  them  that  he  was  come  from  his  younger  Brother,  who %0a%3c had  recommended  his  Daughter  to  him  ;  and,  moreover,  that %0a%3c he  had  shewed  to  him  in  what  place  he  had  buried  his %0a%3c Gold,  without  the  knowledge  of  any  Man  :  requesting  him %0a%3c also  to  employ  that  Provision  which  he  had  prepared  for %0a%3c him  about  his  own  Funeral.  As  he  was  relating  this  matter, %0a%3c his  Brother's  domestic  Servants  came  in  great  haste  to  the %0a%3c House,  and  brought  word  that  their  Master  was  dead ;  and %0a%3c the  Gold  was  found  in  the  place  he  had  pointed  out.  And %0a%3c truly  life  is  full  of  these  Divinations ;  but  they  are  not  to  be %0a%3c compared  with  these,  as  for  the  most  part  they  are  mere %0a%3c lies,  as  we  will  prove  by  one  notable  example :  in  the %0a%3c Sicilian  War,  Gabienus,  one  of  the  bravest  Officers  of %0a%3c CcBsars  Fleet,  was  taken  prisoner  by  Sex.  Pompey,  and  by %0a%3c commandment  from  him  his  Head  was  almost  stricken  off, %0a%3c so  that  it  scarcely  hung  to  the  Neck  by  the  Skin,  and  in  this %0a%3c condition  he  lay  all  day  on  the  Shore.  When  it  grew %0a%3c toward  the  Evening,  and  a  Company  were  flocked  about %0a%3c him,  with  a  groan  and  prayers  he  requested  that  Pompey %0a%3c would  come  to  him,  or  at  least  send  some  one  of  those  who %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  Clapping  the  hands  together  appears  to  have  been  an  ordinary %0a%3c method  of  summoning  the  attendants  before  bells  came  into  use  for  that %0a%3c purpose. —  Wern.

Then  Pompey %0a%3c sent  several  of  his  friends,  to  whom  Gabienus  related  that %0a%3c the  Infernal  Gods  were  well  pleased  with  the  Cause  and %0a%3c pious  Dispositions  of  Pompey^  and  therefore  he  should  have %0a%3c as  good  an  issue  of  it  as  he  could  wish.  Thus  much,  he  said, %0a%3c he  was  commanded  to  deliver ;  and  as  a  proof  of  the  truth, %0a%3c so  soon  as  he  had  done  his  errand  he  would  immediately %0a%3c expire  :  and  so  it  came  to  pass.

[BooK  VII. %0a%3c %0a%3c an  Actor  in  Comedies,  as  is  reported  by  ancient  Writers, %0a%3c died  with  the  most  laboured  security  of  Death  :  for  after  he %0a%3c had  afforded  much  Pleasure  to  the  People  on  his  Birth-day %0a%3c he  held  a  Feast ;  and  when  the  Supper  was  set  forth,  he %0a%3c called  for  some  hot  Drink  in  a  Basin  :  and  casting  his  Eye %0a%3c on  the  Mask  that  he  had  worn  that  day,  he  took  off  the %0a%3c Chaplet  from  his  Head,  and  set  it  on  it ;  in  this  habit  he %0a%3c became  cold  before  any  Man  perceived  it,  until  he  that %0a%3c reclined  next  to  him  put  him  in  mind  that  his  Drink  was %0a%3c growing  cold.  These  are  examples  of  happy  Deaths.  But, %0a%3c on  the  other  hand,  there  is  a  very  great  number  of  those  that %0a%3c are  miserable.  L.

We  find  in  the %0a%3c Public  Acts,  that  when  Felix,  one  of  the  Red-coloured %0a%3c Chariot- drivers,  was  carried  out  to  be  burnt,  one  of  those %0a%3c who  favoured  him  threw  himself  into  his  Funeral  Fire.  A %0a%3c frivolous  matter  it  is  to  speak  of;  but  they  of  the  other  side, %0a%3c that  this  act  should  not  be  ascribed  to  the  honour  of  the %0a%3c Artist  abovenamed,  gave  it  out,  that  this  Friend  of  his  did  it %0a%3c only  because  his  Head  was  intoxicated  with  the  strong  smell %0a%3c of  the  Odours.  Not  long  before  this  M.  Lepidus,1  descended %0a%3c from  a  most  noble  Family,  who  (as  is  above  said)  died %0a%3c through  Grief,  was  by  the  violence  of  the  Flame  cast  off  from %0a%3c the  Funeral  Pile ;  and  as,  because  of  the  extreme  Heat,  no %0a%3c one  could  come  near  to  lay  him  again  on  the  place,  he  was %0a%3c burnt  naked  on  a  pile  of  dry  Vine  Cuttings,  near  the  former. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  LIV.         t .,_ %0a%3c Of  Burial. %0a%3c %0a%3c To  burn  the  Bodies2  of  the  Dead  was  not  an  ancient %0a%3c Custom  among  the  Romans  ;  but  they  Buried  them  in  the %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  The  cause  of  his  death  is  mentioned  in  the  36th  chapter  of  this %0a%3c book.—  Wern.

But  after  they  understood  that  the  Bodies  of  the %0a%3c Men  slain  in  the  distant  Wars  were  taken  up  out  of  the  Earth %0a%3c again,  it  was  appointed  to  Burn  them.  And  yet  many  Fami- %0a%3c lies kept  still  to  the  old  Customs:  as  in  the  House  of  the %0a%3c Cornelii  no  one  is  reported  to  have  been  burnt  before  L. %0a%3c Sylla,  the  Dictator.  And  he  willed  it  through  dread  that  he %0a%3c should  be  so  served  as  he  had  done  by  C.  Marius,  whose %0a%3c Corpse  he  had  caused  to  be  digged  up.  (In  Latin)  he  is  said %0a%3c to  be  Sepultus,  who  is  bestowed  in  any  way ;  but  Humatus %0a%3c sigriifieth  that  he  is  covered  with  the  Earth. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  LV. %0a%3c Of  the  Soul,  or  the  Manes.1 %0a%3c %0a%3c AFTER  Sepulture  there  is  very  great  Obscurity  regarding %0a%3c the  Manes  ;  but  this  is  generally  held,  that  in  whatever  Con- %0a%3c familiarly  spoken  of  by  Homer.  That  it  was  more  ancient  among  the %0a%3c Romans  than  is  represented  by  Pliny  appears  from  Ovid  ;  who  ("  Fasti," %0a%3c c.  4)  speaks  of  its  having  been  practised  on  the  body  of  Remus,  the  bro- %0a%3c ther of  Romulus.  The  same  is  also  negatively  proved  by  Numa,  who %0a%3c ordered  that  his  body  should  not  be  burned ;  and  by  the  laws  of  the %0a%3c Twelve  Tables,  regulations  were  instituted  concerning  it :  chiefly  to  pre- %0a%3c vent extravagant  expense  in  the  ceremony.  The  general  fashion  of %0a%3c burning,  in  preference  to  interment,  succeeded  to  the  example  set  by %0a%3c Sylla ;  after  whose  day  it  was  practised  even  by  people  of  inferior  orders  : %0a%3c but  neither  burning  nor  burial  were  allowed  by  law  within  the  bounds %0a%3c of  the  city.  An  ordinance  of  Numa  forbade  that  a  woman  who  died  in %0a%3c childbirth  should  be  buried,  until  the  child  was  taken  from  her  ;  and  the %0a%3c usual  ceremonies  were  to  be  omitted  when  the  person  had  been  killed  by %0a%3c lightning. — Wern.  Club. %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  "  Manes  "  was  a  general  term  expressive  of  the  souls  of  men  after %0a%3c they  were  separated  from  the  body.  They  were  supposed  to  be  arranged %0a%3c in  classes,  according  to  their  moral  condition  :  for  which  see  a  note, %0a%3c vol.  i.  p.  24.  But  however  situated,  a  kind  of  deityship  was  supposed  to %0a%3c attach  itself  to  them :  and  hence  they  were  addressed  as  Dii  Manes. %0a%3c Such  was  the  popular  opinion,  as  referred  to  by  Virgil,  Ovid,  and  other %0a%3c writers  who  reflected  the  public  mind ;  but  it  was  scarcely  an  article  of %0a%3c faith  among  philosophers  and  the  higher  classes,  whose  opinions  fluctuated %0a%3c according  to  circumstances.  As  a  motive  to  moral  obligation  and  respon- %0a%3c sibility it  was  exceedingly  feeble. %0a%3c %0a%3c Pliny's  observation,  "  that  in  whatever  condition  they  were  before %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 248  History  of  Nature.

For  neither  Body  nor  Soul %0a%3c hath  any  more  Sense  after  Death  than  they  had  before  the %0a%3c Day  of  Birth.  But  the  Vanity  of  Men  extendeth  itself  even %0a%3c into  the  future,  and  in  the  very  Time  of  Death  fiattereth %0a%3c itself  with  a  Life  after  this.  For  some  attribute  Immortality %0a%3c to  the  Soul ;  others  devise  a  Transfiguration  ;  some  again %0a%3c %0a%3c they  were  born,  in  the  same  they  remain  after  they  are  dead,"  may  be %0a%3c understood  as  referring  to  the  Pythagorean  doctrine  of  Transmigration  ; %0a%3c which  was  the  most  plausible  account  .of  the  disposition  of  the  intelligent %0a%3c principle  that  the  Heathens  could  reach  to,  before  Light  and  Immor- %0a%3c tality were  revealed  in  the  Gospel;  but  by  the  almost  contemptuous %0a%3c silence  with  which  he  passes  it  over  in  his  argument,  it  appears  that  he %0a%3c did  not  feel  disposed  to  credit  it.  With  regard  to  the  station  of  the %0a%3c manes,  Plato  supposes  that  impure  spirits  wander  about  among  sepulchres %0a%3c and  monuments.  Homer  represents  Elpenor  as  prevented  from  rest %0a%3c until  the  funeral  rites  were  paid ;  and  a  commonly  received  doctrine  was, %0a%3c that  there  were  days  sacred  to  Dis  and  Proserpine,  on  which  the  whole  of %0a%3c the  secret  and  deep  places  of  the  world  were  thrown  open,  and  the  disem- %0a%3c bodied spirits  were  permitted  to  revisit  the  light.  Varro  supposes  that %0a%3c this  occurs  three  times  in  the  year :  on  the  feast  of  Vulcanalia,  tenth  of %0a%3c the  Calends  of  September,  or  23d  of  August ;  on  the  3d  of  the  Nones  of %0a%3c October,  the  Fontinalia,  October  13 ;  and  the  6th  of  the  Ides  of  November, %0a%3c or  8th  of  that  month. %0a%3c %0a%3c According  to  the  doctrine  of  the  Jewish  Rabbis,  derived,  no  doubt, %0a%3c from  ancient  Oriental  sources,  "  during  the  first  twelve  months  after %0a%3c death  the  souls  of  righteous  men  descend  and  ascend  again  "  (Talmud,  tr. %0a%3c Sabbath) :  which  Rabbi  Joseph  Albo,  in  the  "  Book  of  Principles,"  c.  xxxi., %0a%3c explains  by  saying,  that  the  soul  does  not  directly  and  at  once  become %0a%3c divested  of  those  corporeal  attachments  to  which  it  is  accustomed,  but %0a%3c lingers  about  them  until  by  habit  it  becomes  weaned  from  them,  and %0a%3c assimilated  to  the  new  condition  on  which  it  has  entered. %0a%3c %0a%3c The  gloomy  views  which  even  the  more  virtuous  of  the  ancient  Hea- %0a%3c thens took  of  an  invisible  world  is  shewn  by  Homer's  representations  in %0a%3c the  "  Odyssey,"  b.  xi. ;  and  by  so  much  of  Etrurian  learning  as,  from %0a%3c their  paintings  and  other  representations,  have  descended  to  us.  With  so %0a%3c much  distaste  of  a  wearisome  life  on  the  one  hand  (in  which  even  Homer %0a%3c joins,  b.  xvii.),  and  on  the  other  the  dim  prospect  of  the  dreary  regions %0a%3c below,  we  can  scarcely  wonder  if  even  the  virtuous  Pliny  should  choose %0a%3c rather  to  lie  down  in  ashes  without  the  prospect  of  living  again.  The %0a%3c greater  portion  of  his  argument,  however,  is  founded  on  his  ignorance : %0a%3c his  questions,  then  so  doubtful,  are  such  as  now  even  a  child  may  answer. %0a%3c —  Wern.

But  what  is  the  Body  that %0a%3c followeth  the  Material  of  the  Soul  ?  where  lieth  her %0a%3c Thought?  how  is  her  Seeing,  how  is  her  Hearing  per- %0a%3c formed ?  what  toucheth  she  ?  nay,  what  doth  she  at  all  ? %0a%3c How  is  she  employed  ?  or  what  Good  can  there  be  without %0a%3c these  ?  I  would  know  where  she  hath  her  abiding  Place  ? %0a%3c and  what  Multitudes  of  Souls,  like  Shadows,  would  there  be %0a%3c in  so  many  Ages  ?  Surely  these  are  but  fantastical  and %0a%3c childish  Toys,  devised  by  Men  that  would  fain  live  always. %0a%3c The  like  Foolery  there  is  in  preserving  the  Bodies  of  Men. %0a%3c And  the  Vanity  of  Democritus  is  no  less,  who  promised  a %0a%3c Restoration  to  Life,  and  yet  himself  hath  not  come  to  Life %0a%3c again.  And  what  an  Instance  of  Madness  to  think  (an  Evil %0a%3c in  itself)  that  Death  should  be  the  Way  to  a  life !  What %0a%3c Repose  should  ever  Men  have  that  are  born,  if  the  Sense  of %0a%3c their  Souls  should  remain  on  high,  while  their  Shadows  are %0a%3c among  those  below  ?  Certainly,  this  sweet  Inducement, %0a%3c and  Credulity,  destroyeth  the  Benefit  of  the  best  Gift  of %0a%3c Nature,  which  is  Death  ;  and  it  doubleth  the  Pain  of  a  Man %0a%3c who  is  to  die,  if  he  happen  to  consider  what  shall  befall  him %0a%3c in  the  Time  to  come.  For  if  it  be  sweet  to  live,  what  Plea- %0a%3c sure can  one  have,  that  hath  already  lived  ?  But  how  much %0a%3c more  easy  and  certain  is  it  for  each  Man  to  trust  to  himself, %0a%3c and  to  gather  Reasons  from  the  Experience  that  he  had %0a%3c before  he  was  born? %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  LVI. %0a%3c The  first  Inventors  of  Things  in  Life. %0a%3c %0a%3c BEFORE  we  depart  from  this  Discourse  of  Men's  Nature, %0a%3c it  seemeth  convenient  to  point  out  their  Inventions,  and %0a%3c what  each  Man  hath  discovered.

[  BOOK  VII. %0a%3c %0a%3c Pater  appointed  buying  and  selling  ;    he  also  devised  the %0a%3c Diadem,  the  Ornament  of  Kings,  and  the  Triumph.     Ceres %0a%3c shewed  the  use  of  Corn,  whereas  before  Men  lived  on  Mast. %0a%3c She  taught  also  how  to  grind  Corn,  to  knead  Dough,  and %0a%3c make  Bread  of  it,  in  Attica,  Italy,  and  Sicily ;  for  which  she %0a%3c was  reputed  a  Goddess.      She  it  was  that  began  to  make %0a%3c Laws ;  but  others  have  thought  that  Rhadamanthns  was  the %0a%3c first  Lawgiver.     I  am  of  opinion,  that  Letters  ever  were  in %0a%3c Assyria ;  but  some  think,  as  particularly  Gellius,  that  they %0a%3c were  invented  by  Mercury  in  Egypt,  and  others  will  have  it %0a%3c that  they  came  first  from  Syria.     True  it  is,  that  Cadmus %0a%3c brought  into  Greece  from  Phcenice  to  the  Number  of  sixteen; %0a%3c to  which  Palamedes,  in  the  Time  of  the  Trojan  War,  added %0a%3c four,  in  these  characters,  0,  3,  %3c£,  X.    And  after  him  Simon- %0a%3c ides  Melicus1  produced  the  same  Numbers,  z,  H,  T,  a :  the %0a%3c Force  of  all  which  Letters  we  acknowledge  among  ourselves. %0a%3c Aristotle  is  rather  of  opinion,  that  there  were  eighteen  an- %0a%3c cient Letters :  A,  B,  r,  A,  E,  z,  i,  K,  A,  M,  N,  o,  n,  p,  2,  T,  r,  $, %0a%3c and  that  the  other  two,  0  and  X,  were  added  by  Epicharmus, %0a%3c and  not  by  Palamedes.    Anticlides  writeth,  that  one  in  Egypt %0a%3c named  Menon  was  the  Inventor  of  Letters,  fifteen  Years  be- %0a%3c fore the  Time  of  Phoroneus,  the  most  ancient  King  of  Greece : %0a%3c and  he  endeavoureth  to  prove  the  same  by  Monuments.    On %0a%3c the  other  Hand,  Epigenes,  an  Author  as  renowned  as  any, %0a%3c sheweth,   that   among   the    Babylonians   there   were   found %0a%3c Observations  of  the  Stars  for  7*20  Years,  written  on  Bricks  ; %0a%3c and  they  who  speak  of  the  least,  as  Berosus  and  Critodemus, %0a%3c report  the  like  for  480  Years.     Whereby  it  appeareth  that %0a%3c the  use  of  Letters  was  eternal.     The  Pelasgi  brought  their %0a%3c use  into  Latium.     Euryalus  and  Hyperbius,  two  Brothers  at %0a%3c Athens,  invented  the  first  Manufacture  of  Bricks  and  the %0a%3c Formation  of  Houses  ;  for  before  their  Time  Caves  were  used %0a%3c for  Houses.     Gellius  is  of  opinion  that  Doxius,  the  Son  of %0a%3c Ccelus,  devised  the  first  Houses  that  were  made  of  Clay ; %0a%3c taking  his  Pattern  from  the   Nests  of  Swallows.      Cecrops %0a%3c called  a  Town  after  his  own  Name,  Cecropia  ;  which  at  this %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  Some  copies  read  Medicus,  "  a  physician." —  Wern.

Some  will  have  it  that  Argos %0a%3c was  built  before  it  by  King  Phoroneus;  and  others  again, %0a%3c that  Sycione  was  before  them.  The  Egyptians  affirm,  that %0a%3c long  before  that,  their  City  Diospolis  was  founded.  Cinyra, %0a%3c the  Son  of  Agriopa,  invented  the  Slating  of  Houses,  and %0a%3c Mines  of  Brass :  both  within  the  Isle  of  Cyprus.  He  also %0a%3c invented  Pincers,  the  little  Hammer,  the  Lever,  and  the %0a%3c Anvil.

Thrason  was  the  first  Builder %0a%3c of  Walls  :  of  Towers,  the  Cyclops,  as  Aristotle  thinketh ; %0a%3c but  the  Tyrinthii,  according  to  Theophrastus.  Weaving %0a%3c was  the  Invention  of  the  Egyptians  ;  and  Dyeing  Wool, %0a%3c of  the  Lydians  in  Sardis.  Closter,  the  Son  of  Arachne, %0a%3c taught  the  first  making  of  the  Spindle  for  Woollen  Yarn : %0a%3c and  Arachnb  herself,  the  Flax  and  Nets.  Nicias  the  Megaren- %0a%3c sian  invented  the  Fuller's  Art :  Boethius,  the  Art  of  Sewing. %0a%3c The  Egyptians  will  have  Medicine  to  have  been  discovered %0a%3c among  them ;  but  others,  that  Arabus,  the  Son  of  Babylo %0a%3c and  Apollo,  was  its  Author.  The  first  Herbarist  and  Apothe- %0a%3c cary was  Chiron,  Son  of  Saturn  and  Phyllira.  Aristotle %0a%3c thinketh  that  Lydus  the  Scythian  displayed  the  melting  and %0a%3c tempering  of  Brass  ;  Theophrastus,  that  it  was  Delas  the %0a%3c Phrygian.  Some  think  the  Chalybse  devised  the  working %0a%3c into  Vessels  of  Brass,  arid  others  attribute  it  to  the  Cyclopae. %0a%3c The  Discovery  of  Iron  was  the  Invention  of  those  in %0a%3c Crete,  who  were  called  Dactyli  Idaei,  according  to  Hesiod. %0a%3c Erichthonius  the  Athenian  discovered  Silver,  or,  as  others %0a%3c say,  JEacus.

Bellerophon  shewed  first  how  to %0a%3c ride  on  Horseback :  Pelethronius  invented  the  Saddle  and %0a%3c Bridle  for  the  Horse.  The  Thessalians,  called  Centaurs, %0a%3c inhabiting  near  the  Mountain  Pelius,  were  the  first  that %0a%3c fought  on  Horseback.  The  Nation  of  the  Phrygians  first %0a%3c joined  two  Horses  to  a  Chariot ;  and  Erichthonius  four. %0a%3c Palamedes,  during  the  Trojan  War,  invented  the  manner %0a%3c of  setting  an  Army  in  array:  also  the  giving  of  a  Signal, %0a%3c the  Watch-word,  and  the  Outposts  (VigiliaB).  In  the  same %0a%3c War,  Sinon  devised  Watch-towers.  Lycanor  was  the  first %0a%3c Maker  of  a  Truce  :  Theseus,  of  Alliances  :  Car,  from  whom %0a%3c Caria  took  its  Name,  observed  first  the  Flight  of  Birds %0a%3c (Augury) ;  to  which  Orpheus  added  the  Signs  from  other %0a%3c Animals.  Delphus  invented  Divination  from  the  Entrails %0a%3c (Aruspices) :  Amphiaraus,  that  of  the  Inspection  of  Fire %0a%3c (Ignispex)  :  Tyresias,  the  Theban,  that  of  the  Auspices  of %0a%3c Birds.  Amphictyon  gave  the  Interpretation  of  portentous %0a%3c Sights,  and  of  Dreams.  Atlas,  the  Son  of  Libya  (or, %0a%3c as  some  say,  the  Egyptians,  and  as  others  the  Assyrians), %0a%3c invented  Astrology  ;  and  in  that  Science,  Anaximander  the %0a%3c Milesian  devised  the  Sphere.  The  Explanation  of  the %0a%3c Winds  was  given  by  JEolus,  the  Son  of  Helen.  Amphion %0a%3c invented  Music.  The  Flute  and  the  single  Pipe1  were %0a%3c the  Invention  of  Pan,  the  Son  of  Mercury.  The  oblique %0a%3c Cornet  was  by  Midas  in  Phrygia  ;  and  in  the  same  Country %0a%3c Marsyas  invented  the  Double  Flute ;  Amphion  taught  the %0a%3c Lydian  Measures;  Thamyras  the  Thracian,  the  Dorian;  and %0a%3c Marsyas  of  Phrygia,  the  Phrygian.  Amphion,  likewise  (or, %0a%3c as  some  say,  Orpheus,  and  according  to  others,  Linus},  played %0a%3c first  on  the  Lute.2  Ter pander  added  seven  Strings  to  it; %0a%3c Simonides  added  the  eighth ;  and  Timotheus  the  ninth.  Tha- %0a%3c myras was  the  first  that  played  on  the  Lute  without  Song, %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  Fistula  and  Monaiilus.  —  Wern.  Club.  a  Cithara.  —  Wern.

Dardanus,  the  Tro3- %0a%3c zenian,  began  first  vocal  Music  to  the  Flute.1  The  Curetes %0a%3c taught  to  dance  in  Armour ;  and  Pyrrhus  the  Pyrrhic  Dance  ; %0a%3c and  both  these  were  first  practised  in  Crete.  The  Heroic %0a%3c Verse  we  owe  to  the  Oracle  of  Pythius  (Apollo}.  About  the %0a%3c Original  of  Poems  there  is  a  great  Question.  They  are %0a%3c proved  to  have  existed  before  the  Trojan  War.  Pherecydes %0a%3c of  Syros,  in  the  Days  of  King  Cyrus,  invented  the  Writing %0a%3c in  Prose.  Cadmus  the  Milesian  founded  History.  Lycaon %0a%3c appointed  the  first  public  Games  of  Strength  in  Arcadia ; %0a%3c Acastus  in  lolcum,  the  first  solemn  Games  at  Funerals ;  and %0a%3c after  him  Theseus,  in  the  Isthmus.  Hercules  instituted  the %0a%3c Athletic  Exercises  at  Olympia  :  and  Pythus  those  of  Play  at %0a%3c Ball.  Gyges  the  Lydian  first  practised  Painting  in  Egypt; %0a%3c but  in  Greece,  Euchir,  a  Relative  of  Dcedalus,  as  Aristotle %0a%3c supposeth  ;  and  according  to  Theophrastus,  it  was  Polygnotus %0a%3c the  Athenian.  Danaus  was  the  first  that  sailed  with  a  Ship, %0a%3c and  so  he  passed  the  Sea  from  Egypt  to  Greece ;  for  before %0a%3c that  time  they  used  Rafts,  which  were  invented  by  King %0a%3c Erythra,  to  cross  from  one  Island  to  another  in  the  Red  Sea. %0a%3c But  we  meet  with  some  Writers  who  suppose  that  the  Tro- %0a%3c jans and  Mysians  were  the  first  that  devised  Navigation  be- %0a%3c fore them  in  the  Hellespont,  when  they  passed  over-against %0a%3c the  Thracians.  And  even  at  this  Day  in  the  British  Ocean, %0a%3c there  are  made  WTicker  Boats  covered  with  Leather,  and %0a%3c stitched  round  about ;  in  the  Nile,  of  Papyrus,  Cane-reed, %0a%3c and  Rushes.

Zenagoras  of  Syracusa  brought %0a%3c up  those  of  six  Rows  ;  and  from  it  to  those  of  ten,  Mnesigeton %0a%3c was  the  Inventor.  It  is  said  that  Alexander  the  Great  built %0a%3c Galleys  with  twelve  Banks  ;  and  Philostephanus  reporteth, %0a%3c that  Ptolemy  Soter  rose  to  fifteen :  Demetrius,  the  Son  of %0a%3c Antiaonus,  to  thirty  :  Ptolemy  Philadelphus,  to  forty ;  and %0a%3c Ptolemy  Philopater,  surnamed  Tryphon,  to  fifty.  Hippus %0a%3c the  Tyrian  invented  Ships  of  Burden.1  The  Cyrenians  first %0a%3c built  the  Pinnace ;  the  Phoenicians,  the  Ferry-boat ;  the %0a%3c Rhodians,  the  Wherry ;  and  last,  the  Cyprians,  the  Hulk. %0a%3c The  Phoenicians  were  the  first  that  in  sailing  observed  the %0a%3c Course  of  the  Stars.  The  Copeans  devised  the  Oar,  and  the %0a%3c Plateans  its  broad  End  :  Icarus,  the  Sails  :  Dcedalus,  the %0a%3c Mast  and  the  Yard.  Vessels  for  transporting  Horses  were %0a%3c the  Invention  of  the  Samians,  or  else  of  Pericles  the  Athe- %0a%3c nian. The  Thasii  formed  the  long-covered  Ships :  for  before %0a%3c their  Time  they  fought  only  from  the  Stern  and  the  Bow. %0a%3c Piseus  added  the  Rostra ;  the  Tyrrhenians,  the  Anchor ;  to %0a%3c which  Eupalamus  added  the  two  Claws,  and  Anac/tarsis  the %0a%3c Grappling-hooks.  The  Stock  was  by  Pericles  the  Athenian ; %0a%3c and  finally,  the  Steering-tackle  by  Typhis.  The  Chief  that %0a%3c first  fought  in  a  Fleet  was  Minos.

The  Protogonus  and  (Eon  here  spoken  of,  being  the %0a%3c first  generation  of  mortals,  were  the  discoverers  of  the  way  of  taking %0a%3c food  from  trees;  and  their  children,  Genus  and  Genea,  in  a  time  of %0a%3c scarcity  in  Phanicia,  first  worshipped  the  sun,  as  Beelsamin,  or  only %0a%3c Lord  of  Heaven. %0a%3c %0a%3c "  Hypsuranius,  a  Tyrian,  first  made  huts  of  reeds  and  rushes,  and  the %0a%3c paper-reeds.  His  brother  Usoiis  first  invented  covering  for  his  body,  out %0a%3c of  the  skins  of  wild  beasts  which  he  could  catch ;  which  may  be  reconciled %0a%3c with  the  narrative  in  Genesis,  iii.  21.  He  consecrated  two  rude  stone %0a%3c pillars  to  the  fire  and  wind,  and  worshipped  them  with  the  sprinkling  of %0a%3c the  blood  of  wild  beasts  taken  in  hunting.  He  first  ventured  on  the  sea %0a%3c in  a  kind  of  raft ;  and  on  his  death  were  first  instituted  anniversary  feasts. %0a%3c Many  years  after  him,  Agreus  and  Halieus  were  the  inventors  of  the  arts, %0a%3c and  it  would  appear,  the  fathers  of  tribes  who  pursued  hunting  and  fish- %0a%3c ing. The  two  brothers  who  invented  the  working  of  iron  were  their %0a%3c sons.  One  of  these,  named  Chrysor,  the  same  as  Vulcan,  employed %0a%3c charms  and  divinations ;  he  invented  the  hook,  bait,  and  fishing-line,  and %0a%3c boats  slightly  made :  perhaps  those  covered  with  leather,  mentioned  by %0a%3c Pliny  as  used  in  his  day  in  Britain,  and  originally  derived  from  this %0a%3c Eastern  source.  This  Coracle,  employed  so  late  as  the  fourth  or  fifth  cen- %0a%3c tury of  Christianity  in  crossing  the  British  Channel,  is  still  used  in  Welsh %0a%3c rivers,  and  is  figured,  in  its  modern  structure,  by  Mr.  Yarrell  ("  History %0a%3c of  British  Fishes,"  vol.  ii.  p.  62,  2d  edit.)  :  a  copy  from  an  ancient  relievo %0a%3c in  Montfaucon  is  at  the  end  of  this  volume.  It  was  a  subsequent  race, %0a%3c the  Cabiri,  that  formed  the  first  complete  ship.  From  the  last  generation, %0a%3c or  Chrysor  and  his  brother,  sprang  two  brothers :  one  called  Technites,  or %0a%3c the  artist,  and  the  other,  Ge'inus  Autochthon,  the  home-born  man  of  the %0a%3c earth.  These  first  mingled  stubble  with  the  brick  earth,  and  dried  the %0a%3c tiling  in  the  sun.  This  accommodation  was  further  improved  by  the  for- %0a%3c mation of  courts,  fences,  and  cellars  about  houses.  They  were  husband- %0a%3c men, and  worshipped  a  statue  carried  about  in  a  movable  temple,  drawn %0a%3c by  oxen.  This  practice  is  alluded  to  by  the  prophet  Amos,  v.  26,  and %0a%3c perhaps  2  Samuel,  vi.  3  and  7.  These  were  the  first  that  employed  dogs %0a%3c in  the  hunting  of  wild  animals.  Amynus  and  Magus,  their  sons,  first %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BOOK  VII .].

Inachus,  whom  Archbishop  Usher  makes  contem- %0a%3c porary with  the  Scriptural  Nahor,  was  the  inventor  of  honorary  gold  and %0a%3c silver  chains.  The  purple  dye  from  shell-fish  was  discovered  by  the  Phre- %0a%3c nician  Hercules,  the  great  navigator  Melcartus,  who  first  passed  through %0a%3c the  Straits  of  Gibraltar,  and  visited  Cornwall.  It  is  true,  there  seems  some %0a%3c doubt  whether  there  be  not  two  individuals  referred  to  under  this  name, %0a%3c one  of  whom  lived  in  the  days  of  Canaan ;  but  if  so,  at  least  they  were %0a%3c natives  of  the  same  country,  and  were  both  honoured  by  their  country- %0a%3c men as  inventors  of  the  arts  by  which  the  nation  acquired  riches  and %0a%3c eminency.  Cronus  first  taught  the  use  of  the  bow  as  a  weapon;  which %0a%3c took  place  in  Crete,  an  island  afterwards  famous  for  this  kind  of  skill. %0a%3c 4  Eupolemus  says  of  Enoch,  that  he  was  the  true  Atlas,  the  inventor  of %0a%3c astronomy.'  Finally,  the  infamy  of  having  first  practised  persecution  for %0a%3c religion  is  ascribed  to  Cronus,  who  is  supposed  to  be  Ham,  the  son  of %0a%3c Noah,  with  the  concurrence  of  the  Egyptian  Thoth ;  but  the  Jews  are %0a%3c inclined  to  derive  its  origin  from  the  city  of  Ur,  in  Chaldaea,  where  Terah %0a%3c was  put  to  death  in  the  fire  (Ur)  :  but  in  either  case  the  act  was  devised %0a%3c in  support  of  false  religion,  or  idolatry." — Wern.  Club. %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  In  the  beginning  of  the  56th  chapter,  Pliny  has  expressed  his  belief %0a%3c that  the  Assyrian  letters  are  the  most  ancient  in  the  world :  but  whether %0a%3c these  were  the  same  as  in  recent  times  have  been  discovered  among  the %0a%3c antique  monuments  of  Nineveh  and  Babylon ;  the  Chaldsean  characters %0a%3c afterwards  introduced  among  the  Jews  by  Ezra ;  or  the  ancient  Pho2ni- %0a%3c cian,  now  termed  the  Samaritan;  in  either  case  it  is  only  by  passing %0a%3c through  great  mutations  that  they  can  be  traced  to  the  Greek  and  Latin %0a%3c forms  of  the  days  of  Pliny.

The  first  that %0a%3c entered  Italy  came  from  Sicily,  in  the  454th  Year  after  the %0a%3c Foundation  of  Rome.  They  were  brought  in  by  P.  Ticinius %0a%3c Mena,  as  Varro  reporteth:  for  before  this  they  were  un- %0a%3c shorn. The  first  that  took  up  the  practice  to  Shave  every %0a%3c day  was  Scipio  Africanus :  and  after  him  cometh  Divus %0a%3c Augustus,  who  always  used  the  Rasor.1 %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  LX. %0a%3c When  was  the  fast  Dial.2 %0a%3c %0a%3c THE  third  Consent  of  all  Nations  was  in  the  observation  of %0a%3c the  Hours ;  and  this  was  grounded  upon  Reason :  but  at %0a%3c what  Time,  and  by  whom  this  was  Invented  in  Greece,  we %0a%3c have  declared  in  the  Second  Book  ;  and  it  was  late  before %0a%3c this  came  up  at  Rome.  In  the  Twelve  Tables  the  East  and %0a%3c West  alone  are  mentioned  ;  after  some  Years  the  Noon  was %0a%3c added,  and  the  Consul's  Officer  proclaimed  Noon  when, %0a%3c standing  at  the  Hall  of  the  Council,  he  beheld  the  Sun  in %0a%3c %0a%3c the  Greeks  Hermes,  found  out  the  first  letters ;  but  these  appear,  from %0a%3c his  subsequent  remarks,  to  have  been  what  we  now  term  hieroglyphics. %0a%3c It  may  be  the  phonetic  characters,  of  which  Pliny  ascribes  the  invention %0a%3c to  Meno  the  Egyptian ;  but  it  is  probable  that  they  are  all  much  more %0a%3c ancient. — Wern.

Club. %0a%3c %0a%3c 2  Lumisden  has  some  observations  on  the  Roman  method  of  measur- %0a%3c ing time.     "  I  do  not  conceive,"  he  says,  "  how  a  sun-dial  or  any  other %0a%3c instrument  could  point  out  the  various  hours,  as  time  was  computed  by %0a%3c the  ancient  Romans.     The  time  the  earth  takes  to  revolve  once  round  its %0a%3c axis,  or  the  space  between  the  rising  of  the  sun  till  its  next  rising,  which %0a%3c makes  a  day  and  a  night,  divided  into  twenty-four  equal  parts,  we  call %0a%3c hours.    Now,  the  Romans  divided  the  day  and  the  night  into  twenty-four %0a%3c hours.    Twelve  of  these,  from  the  rising  of  the  sun  to  its  setting,  con- %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BOOK  VII.]  History  of  Nature.  259 %0a%3c %0a%3c that  Quarter  between  the  Rostra  and  the  Grecostasis.  But %0a%3c when  the  Sun  inclined  downward  from  the  Column  named %0a%3c Moenia,  to  the  Prison,  he  proclaimed  the  last  Quarter  (of  the %0a%3c Day).  But  this  observation  would  serve  only  on  clear  Days  ; %0a%3c and  yet  it  was  so  until  the  first  Punic  War.  Fabius  Vestalis %0a%3c writeth,  that  L.  Papyrius  Cursor,  the  Prince,  twelve  Years %0a%3c before  the  War  with  Pyrrhus,  to  do  the  Romans  a  pleasure %0a%3c set  up  a  Sun-dial  on  the  Temple  of  Quirinus,  when  it  was %0a%3c dedicated,  his  Father  having  vowed  it  before  him.  But %0a%3c this  Author  sheweth  not  either  the  method  of  that  Dial,  or %0a%3c the  Workman ;  nor  yet  from  whence  it  was  brought,  nor  in %0a%3c what  Writer  he  found  it  so  written.  M.  Varro  reporteth, %0a%3c that  the  first  Dial  was  set  up  in  the  common  Market-place, %0a%3c upon  a  Column  near  the  Rostra,  in  the  first  Punic  War,  by %0a%3c M.  Valerius  Messala,  the  Consul,  presently  after  the  taking %0a%3c of  Catana,  in  Sicily ;  from  whence  it  was  brought,  thirty %0a%3c Years  after  the  report  of  the  aforesaid  Dial  of  Papyrius,  in %0a%3c the  Year  of  the  City  477.  And  although  the  Lines  of  this %0a%3c Dial  did  not  agree  with  the  Hours,  yet  were  the  People %0a%3c governed  by  it  for  an  hundred  Years  save  one,  until %0a%3c Q.  Martius  Philippus,  who  was  Censor,  with  L.  Paulus, %0a%3c set  another  by  it,  made  more  carefully.  And  this  gift, %0a%3c among  other  things  done  by  the  Censor,  was  highly %0a%3c acceptable  to  the  People.  But  notwithstanding  this,  if  it %0a%3c were  a  cloudy  Day  the  Hours  were  uncertain ;  and  thus  it %0a%3c %0a%3c stituted  their  day ;  and  the  other  twelve,  from  the  setting  of  the  sun  to %0a%3c its  rising,  constituted  their  night.  Thus,  as  the  seasons  changed,  the %0a%3c length  of  their  hours  must  have  varied.  In  winter  the  twelve  hours  of %0a%3c the  day  were  short,  and  those  of  the  night  long :  in  summer  they  were %0a%3c the  reverse.  How  then  could  these  hours,  of  an  unequal  length,  and %0a%3c which  daily  varied,  be  measured  by  an  instrument  ?  I  have  not  been %0a%3c able  to  discover  any  method  by  which  this  could  be  done.  However, %0a%3c they  had  two  fixed  points,  namely,  mid-day  and  midnight,  which  they %0a%3c called  the  sixth  hour.  So  that  a  meridian  line  would  always  point  out %0a%3c the  sixth  hour,  or  mid- day." %0a%3c %0a%3c That  the  dial  was  a  very  ancient  instrument  for  measuring  time %0a%3c appears  from  the  2d  Book  of  Kings,  xx.  11,  and  Isaiah,  xxxviii.  8, %0a%3c where  is  the  first  mention  of  it  on  record.  It  probably  was  invented  in %0a%3c Babylonia.—  Wern.

Then  Scipio  Nasica,  the  Col- %0a%3c league of  L&nas,  first  divided  the  Hours,  both  of  Day  and %0a%3c Night  equally,  by  Water.  And  this  Horologe  he  dedicated %0a%3c under  a  Roof,  in  the  Year  of  the  City  595  from  the  Build- %0a%3c ing of  Rome.  So  long  it  was,  that  the  People  of  Rome  did %0a%3c not  measure  out  the  Light. %0a%3c %0a%3c Now  let  us  return  to  the  other  Living  Creatures :  and %0a%3c first,  of  Animals  of  the  Land. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Coracle  referred  to  in  note  at  p.  256.— Montfaucon,  torn.  iv.  pi.  49. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c END  OF  VOL.
