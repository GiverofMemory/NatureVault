(1.)—NEW FORMS OF DISF.ASE. %0a%0aThe face of man has recently been sensible of new forms of %0adisease, unknown 1 in ancient times, not only to Italy, but to %0aalmost the whole of Europe. Still, however, they have not as %0ayet extended to the whole of Italy, nor have they made any %0avery great inroads in Illyricum, Gaul, or Spain, or indeed %0aany other parts, to so great an extent as in Rome and its en¬ %0avirons. Though unattended with pain, and not dangerous to %0alife, these diseases are of so loathsome a nature, that any form %0aof death would be preferable to them. %0a%0aCHAP. 2.-THE NATURE OF LICHEN. %0a%0aThe most insupportable of all these diseases is the one which, %0aafter its Greek appellation, is known to us as “ lichen.” 1 In %0aconsequence, however, of its generally making its first appear¬ %0aance at the chin, the Latins, by way of joke, originally— so %0aprone are'maukind to make a jest of the misfortunes of others %0a—gave it the name of “ mentagra ;” 2 an appellation which has %0asince become established in general use. In many cases, how¬ %0aever, this disease spreads over the interior of the mouth, and %0atakes possession of the whole face, with the sole exception of %0athe eyes ; after which, it passes downwards to the neck, breast, %0aand hands, covering them with foul furfuraceous eruptions. %0a%0aCHAP. 3.-AT WHAT PERIOB LICHEN FIRST MADE ITS APPEARANCE %0a%0aIN ITALY. %0a%0aThis curse was unknown to the ancients, 3 and in the times of %0aour fathers even, having first entered Italy in the middle of %0a%0a1 Probably as Littre suggests, a peculiar form of elephantiasis, the %0aleprosy of the middle ages. %0a%0ai The “chin disease from “ mentum,” tbe “ chin.” It is difficult to %0adetect the joke which has here incurred the censure of our author. %0a%0a3 Meaning the people of Italy. %0a%0a%0aChap. 3.] WHEN LICHEN FIUST APPEAHED IN ITALY. 153 %0a%0a%0athe reign of the Emperor Tiberius 4 * Claudius Caesar; where %0ait was introduced from Asia, 4 * in which country it had lately %0amade* its appearance, by a member of the equestrian order at %0aRome, a native of Perusium, secretary to the quaestor. The %0adisease, however, did not attack either females or slaves, 6 7 %0anor yet the lower orders, or, indeed, the middle classes, but %0aonly the nobles, being communicated even by the momentary %0acontact requisite for the act of salutation. 1 Many of those %0awho persevered in undergoing a course of remedial treatment, %0athough cured of the disease, retained scars upon the body more %0ahideous even than the malady itself; it being treated with %0acauteries, as it was certain to break out afresh, unless means %0awere adopted for burning it out of the body by cauterizing to %0athe very bone. %0a%0aUpon this occasion several physicians repaired to Pome %0afrom Egypt, that fruitful parent of maladies of this nature, %0amen who devoted themselves solely to this branch of medical %0apractice; and very considerable were the profits they made. %0aAt all events, it is a well-known fact that Manilius Cornutus, %0aa personage of praetorian rank, and legatus of the province of %0aAquitania, expended no less a sum than two hundred thou¬ %0asand 8 sesterces upon his cure. %0a%0aIt is much more frequently, on the other hand, that we hear %0aof new forms of diseases attacking the lower orders; a singular %0afact, and one quite unequalled for the marvellous phaenomena %0awhich sometimes attend these outbreaks. Thus, for instance, %0awe find an epidemic suddenly making its appearance in a cer¬ %0atain country, and then confining itself, as though it had made %0aits election so to do, to certain parts of the body, certain ages, %0aand even certain pursuits in life. In the same way, too, while %0a%0a4 It is somewhat difficult to say whether Tiberius, the predecessor, or %0aClaudius, the successor of Caligula, is meant; most probably the latter, %0aas the former’s reign would have been in the times of “ our fathers.” %0a%0a4 * Asia Minor. %0a%0a6 “ Cum apparuisset.” He is probably wrong here, for leprosy was %0aknown in Asia from the very earliest times. %0a%0a6 This assertion as to the slaves and lower orders is somewhat doubtful, %0athough it is very possible that the diet and habits of the higher orders %0aumy have predisposed them more particularly for the attacks of the diseases. %0a%0a7 “Osculi,” “kissing;” a nauseous and silly practice, still adhered to, %0abetween bearded men even, in many parts of Europe. %0a%0a11 Upwards of £1500. %0a%0a%0a154 %0a%0a%0apliny’s natural history. %0a%0a%0a[Book XXVI. %0a%0a%0aone class of diseases attacks the young, another confines itself %0ato adults ; while one malady extends itself only to the hightr %0aclasses, another is felt exclusively by the poor. %0a%0aCHAP. 4 .- CARBUNCLE. %0a%0aWe find it stated in the Annals, that it was in the censorship 1 %0aof L. Paulus and Q. Marcius that carbuncle 10 was first intro- %0aduced into Italy, a malady which till then had confined itself %0asolely to the province of Gallia Narbonensis. In the year %0ain which I am writing these lines, two persons of consular %0arank have died of this disease, Julius Rufus 11 and Q. Lecanius %0aBassus ; 12 the former in consequence of an incision unskilfully %0amade by his medical attendants, the latter through a wound %0aupon the thumb of the left hand by pricking a carbuncle with %0aa needle, a wound so small originally as to be hardly percep¬ %0atible. %0a%0aThis disease makes its appearance in the more hidden 13 parts %0aof the human, body, and mostly beneath the tongue. It ori¬ %0aginally has the form of a hard, red, pimple, with a blackish %0ahead mostly, though sometimes of a livid colour. It produces %0atension of the flesh, but unattended with swelling, pain, or %0aany itching sensation ; indeed, the only symptom that accom¬ %0apanies it is a confirmed drowsiness, which overpowers the pa- %0atient, and carries him off in the course of three days. Some¬ %0atimes, however, it is accompanied with shuddering, and small %0apustules about the sore ; and occasionally, though but rarely, %0awith fever. When these symptoms extend to the fauces and %0aoesophagus, death ensues with the greatest rapidity. %0a%0aCHAP. 5.-ELEPHANTIASIS. %0a%0aWe have already 14 stated that elephantiasis 15 was unknown %0a%0a3 a.u.c 590. %0a%0a10 “ Carbunculus.” A malignant pustule, accompanied with swelling and %0aending with gangrene, is still known by this name, but it does not mani¬ %0afest any particular preference for the mouth and tongue. Fee says that %0acarbuncle was recently (1833) endemic in Provence, the ancient’Gallia %0aNarbonensis, for which reason it had received the name of “ Charbon Pro¬ %0avencal.” %0a%0a11 Consul, A.u.c. 819. 12 Consul, a.u.c. 816. %0a%0a13 Judging from this symptom, Dalechamps says that it looks more like %0achancre than carbuncle. u In B. xx. c. 52. %0a%0a15 Supposed, as Pliny says, to have originally come from Upper Egypt. %0a%0a%0aChap.

In its primary form it bears a consider¬ %0aable resemblance to a small lentil upon the nose; the skin %0agradually dries up all over the body, is marked with spots of %0avarious colours, and presents an unequal surface, being thick %0ain one place, thin in another, indurated every here and there, %0aand covered with a sort of rough scab. At a later period, the %0askin assumes a black hue, and compresses the flesh upon the %0abones, the fingers and toes becoming swollen. %0a%0aThis disease was originally peculiar to Egypt. "Whenever it %0aattacked the kings of that country, it was attended with pe¬ %0aculiarly fatal effects to the people, it being the practice to %0atemper their sitting-baths with human blood, for tbe treatment %0aof the disease. As for Italy, however, its career was very %0asoon cut short: the same was the case, too, with the disease %0aknown as “ gemursa” 16 to the ancients, a malady which made %0aits appearance between the toes, and the very name of which is %0anow buried in oblivion. %0a%0a%0achap. 6.—COLIC. %0a%0aIt is a remarkable fact that some diseases should disappear %0afrom among us, while others, again, should continue to prevail, %0acolic 17 for example. It was only in the reign of Tiberius %0aCaesar that this malady made its appearance in Italy, the %0aemperor himself being the first to be attacked by it; a cir¬ %0acumstance which produced considerable mystification through¬ %0aout the City, when it read the edict issued by that prince %0aexcusing his inattention to public business, on the ground of his %0abeing laid up with a disease, the very name of which was till %0athen unknown. To what cause are we to attribute these various %0adiseases, or how is it that we have thus incurred the anger of %0athe gods ? Was it deemed too little for man to be exposed to %0a%0aLucretius, B. vi. 1. 1111, et seq ., attributes it to the water of the Nile. It %0ais but rarely known in Europe. %0a%0a16 Fee thinks that this may have been a sort of abscess similar to those %0abetween the fingers which are known as fourches by the French, and by %0amedical men as “ Aposthema phalangum.” Gruner considers it to be a sort %0aof Elephantiasis, and Triller identifies it with the disease called Gumretha %0aby the Talmudists. %0a%0a11 “ Colurn.” Fee takes this to be Schirrus of the colon. %0a%0a%0am %0a%0a156 pliny’s natural history. [BoolXXYL %0a%0afixed and determinate classes of maladies, already more than %0athree hundred in number, that he must have new forms of %0adisease to alarm him as well ? And then, in addition to all %0athese, not less in number are the troubles and misfortunes which %0aman brings upon himself! %0a%0aThe remedies which I am here describing, are those which %0awere universally employed in ancient times, Nature herself, %0aso to say, making up the medicines: indeed, for a long time %0athese were the only medicines employed. %0a%0a(2.) Hippocrates, 18 it is well known, was the first to com¬ %0apile a code of medical precepts, a thing which he did with the %0agreatest perspicuity, as his treatises, we find, are replete with %0ainformation upon the various plants. No less is the informa- %0ation which, we gain from the works of Diodes 19 of Carystus, %0asecond only in reputation, as well as date, to Hippocrates. %0aThe same, too, with reference to the works of Praxagoras, %0aChrysippus, and, at a later period, Erasistratus 20 of Cos. %0aHerophilus 21 too, though himself the founder of a more refined %0asystem of medicine, was extremely profuse of his commenda¬ %0ations of the use of simples. At a later period, however, expe¬ %0arience, our most efficient instructor in all things, medicine in | %0aparticular, gradually began to be lost sight of in mere words %0aand verbiage: it being found, in fact, much more agreeable %0ato sit in schools, and to listen to the talk of a professor, than %0ato go a simpling in the deserts, and to be searching for this %0aplant or that at all the various seasons of the year. %0a%0aCHAP. 7. (3.)- THE NEW SYSTEM OF MEDICINE: ASCLEP1ADE3 %0a%0aTHE PHYSICIAN. %0a%0aStill, however, the ancient theories remained unshaken, %0abased as they were upon the still existing grounds of uni¬ %0aversally acknowledged experience ; until, in the time of Pom- %0apeius Magnus, Asclepiades, 22 a professor of rhetoric, who %0aconsidered himself not sufficiently repaid by that pursuit, and %0awhose readiness and sagacity rendered him better adapted for %0aany other than forensic practice, suddenly turned his attention %0ato the medical art. Having never practised medicine, and %0abeing totally unacquainted with the nature of remedies—a %0a%0a18 See B. xxix. c. i. 13 See end of B. xx. %0a%0a20 See B. xxix. c. 3. 21 See B. xxix. c. 5. %0a%0a22 See end of B. vii. %0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 8.] CHANGES EFFECTED DY ASCLEPIADES. 157 %0a%0aknowledge only to be acquired by personal examination and %0aactual experience—as a matter of course, he was obliged to %0arenounce all previously-established theories, and to trust rather %0ato his flowing periods and his well-studied discourses, for %0againing an influence upon the minds of his audience. %0a%0aReducing the whole art of medicine to an estimation solely %0aof primary causes, he made it nothing but a merely con¬ %0ajectural art, and established it as his creed, that there are five %0agreat principles of treatment for all diseases in common ; diet, %0ause or non-use of wine, frictions, exercise on foot, and ex¬ %0aercise 23 in a carriage or on horseback. As every one perceived %0athat each of these methods of treatment lay quite within his %0aown reach, all, of course, with the greatest readiness gave %0atheir assent, willing as they were to believe that to be true %0awhich was so easy of acquisition; and hence it was that he %0aattracted nearly all the world about him, as though he had %0abeen sent among mankind on a special mission from heaven. %0a%0aCHAP. 8. -THE CHANGES EFFECTED BY ASCLEPIADES IN THE %0a%0aPliACTICE OF MEDICINE. %0a%0aIn addition to this, he had a wonderful tact in gaining the %0afull confidence of his patients : sometimes he would make them %0aa promise of wine, and then seize the opportune moment for %0aadministering it, while on other occasions, again, he would %0aprescribe cold water: indeed, as Herophilus, among the an¬ %0acients, had been the first to enquire into the primary causes of %0adisease, and Cleophantus had brought into notice the treat¬ %0ament of diseases by wine, so did Asclepiades, as we learn from %0aM. V arro, prefer to be indebted for his surname and repute %0ato the extensive use made by him of cold water as a %0aremedy, lie employed also various other soothing remedies %0afor his patients; thus, for instance, it was he that introduced %0aswinging beds, the motion of which might either lull the %0amalady, or induce sleep, as deemed desirable. It was he, %0atoo, that brought baths into such general use,—a method of %0atreatment that was adopted -with the greatest avidity—in %0auddition to numerous other modes of treatment of a pleasant %0aand soothing nature. By these means he acquired a great %0aprofessional reputation, and a no less extended fame; which %0a%0a23 “ Gestationesexercise on horseback, in a litter, or in a carriage %0adrawn by horses. %0a%0a%0a158 %0a%0a%0aplint’s natural iustory. %0a%0a%0a[Book XJYI. %0a%0a%0awas very considerably enhanced by the following incident: %0ameeting the funeral procession of a person unknown to him, %0ahe ordered the body to be removed from the funeral pile 24 and %0acarried home, and was thus the means of saving his life. This %0acircumstance I am the more desirous to mention, that it may %0anot be imagined that it was on slight grounds only that so %0aextensive a revolution was effected in the medical art. %0a%0aThere is, however, one thing, and one thing only, at which %0awe have any ground for indignation,—the fact, that a single %0aindividual, and he belonging to the most frivolous nation 24 in %0athe world, a man born in utter indigence, should all on a %0asudden, and that, too, for the sole purpose of increasing his %0aincome, give a new code of medical laws to mankind; laws, %0ahowever, be it remembered, which have been annulled by %0anumerous authorities since his day. The success of Asclepi- %0aades was considerably promoted by many of the usages of ancient %0amedicine, repulsive in their nature, and attended with far too %0amuch anxiety : thus, for instance, it was the practice to cover %0aup the patient with vast numbers of clothes, and to adopt %0aevery possible method of promoting the perspiration ; to order %0athe body to be roasted before a fire; or else to be continually %0asending the patient on a search for sunshine, a thing hardly to %0abe found in a showery climate like that of this city of ours; %0aor rather, so to say, of the whole of Italy, so prolific 25 * as it is %0aof fogs and rain. 26 It was to remedy these inconveniences, %0athat he introduced the use of hanging baths, 27 an invention %0athat was found grateful to invalids in the very highest %0adegree. %0a%0aIn addition to this, he modified the tortures which had %0ahitherto attended the treatment of certain maladies; as in %0aquinzv for instance, the cure of which before his time had been %0ausually effected by the introduction of an instrument 28 into the %0athroat. He condemned, and with good reason, the indiscrimi¬ %0anate use of emetics, which till then had been resorted to in a %0a%0a21 See B. vii. c. 37. Apuleius gives the story at considerable length, in %0athe Florida, B. iv. %0a%0a25 Asia Minor. Asclepiades was a native of Prusa in Bithynia. %0a%0aas* yve adopt Sillig’s suggestion, and read “ nimborum altrice,” the %0aword “ imperatrice ” being evidently out of place. The climate of Italy %0aseems to have changed very materially since bis day. %0a%0a26 See B. ii. c. 51. 27 See B. ix. c. 79. 26 “ Organo." %0a%0a%0aChap. 9.] REMARKS ON THE PRACTICES OF MAGIC. 159 %0a%0amost extraordinary degree. He disapproved also of the prac¬ %0atice of administering internally potions that are naturally %0ainjurious to the stomach, a thing that may truthfully be pro¬ %0anounced of the greater part of them. Indeed it will be as well %0ato take an early opportunity of stating what are the medi¬ %0acaments which, act beneficially upon the stomach. %0a%0aCHAP. 9. (4).- REMARKS IN DISPRAISE OF THE PRACTICES OF MAGIC. %0a%0aBut above all things, it was the follies of magic more par¬ %0aticularly that contributed so essentially to his success—follies %0awhich had been carried to such a pitch as to destroy all confi¬ %0adence in the remedial virtues of plants. Thus, for instance, %0ait was stoutly maintained that by the agency of the plant aethi- %0aopis 29 rivers and standing waters could be dried up, and that by %0athe very touch 30 * * * * all bars and doors might be opened : %0athat if the plant achaemenis 31 were thrown into the ranks of the %0aenemy it would be certain to create a panic and put them to %0aflight: that latace 32 was given by the Persian kings to their %0aambassadors, to ensure them an abundant supply of every¬ %0athing wherever they might happen to be: with numerous %0aother reveries of a similar nature. Where, I should like to %0aknow, were all these plants, when the Cimbri and Teutones %0abrought upon us the horrors of warfare with their terrific yells ? %0aor when Lucullus defeated, with a few legions, so many kings %0awho ruled over the Magi ? 33 Why is it too that the Roman %0agenerals have always made it their first care in warfare to %0amake provision for the victualling of their troops ? And how %0awas it that at Pharsalia the troops of Caesar were suffering from %0afamine, if an abundance of everything could have been ensured %0aby the fortunate possession of a single plant ? Would it not have %0abeen better too for Scipio JEmilianus to have opened the gates %0aof Carthage by touching them with a herb, than to have taken %0aso many years to batter down its bulwarks with his engines of %0awar? %0a%0aTurning to the present moment, let them, by the agency of %0athe herb menu's, 3 * dry up the Pomp tine 35 Marshes, if they can, %0a%0a29 See B. xxiv. c. 102. %0a%0aJ,J We agree with Pintianus that the name of some plant here has been %0alost, the word ‘‘condiendis ” making no sense. %0a%0a31 See B. xxiv. c. 102. %0a%0a32 Some plant as fictitious as the others here mentioned. %0a%0a33 See B. xxx. c. i. 31 See B. xxiv. c. 102. 33 See B. iii. c. 9. %0a%0a%0apunt’s natural history. %0a%0a%0a1 %0a%0a%0a160 %0a%0a%0a[nook 1XYI %0a%0a%0aand by these means restore so much territory to the regions of %0aItaly in the neighbourhood of our city. In the works, too, of %0aDemocritus, already mentioned, 36 we find a recipe for the compo¬ %0asition of a medicament which will ensure the procreation of %0aissue, both sure to be good and fortunate.—W hat king of Persia, %0apray, ever obtained that blessing ? It really would be a mar¬ %0avellous fact that human credulity, taking its rise originally in %0athe very soundest of notions, should have ultimately arrived at %0asuch a pitch as this, if the mind of man understood, under any %0acircumstances, how to keep within the bounds of modera¬ %0ation ; and if the very system of medicine thus introduced by %0aAsclepiades, had not been carried to a greater pitch of extra¬ %0avagance than the follies of magic even, an assertion which %0aI shall prove on a more appropriate occasion. 31 %0a%0aSuch, however, is the natural constitution of the human %0amind, that, be the circumstances what they may, commencing %0awith what is necessary it speedily arrives at the point of %0alaunching out in excess. %0a%0aWe will now resume our account of the medicinal properties %0aof the plants mentioned in the preceding Book, adding to our %0adescription such others as the necessities of the case may seem %0ato require. %0a%0a%0achap. 10.—lichen: five remedies. %0a%0aAs to the treatment of lichen, so noisome a disease as it is, %0awe shall here give a number of additional remedies for it, %0agathered from all quarters, although those already described %0aare by no means few in number. For the cure of lichea %0aplantago is used, pounded, cinquefoil also, root of albucus 1 ® in %0acombination with vinegar, the young shoots of the fig-tree %0aboiled in vinegar, or roots of marsh-mallow boiled down to %0aone-fourth with glue and vinegar. The sores are rubbed also %0awith pumice, and then fomented with root of rumex 39 bruised %0ain vinegar, or with scum of viscus 40 kneaded up with lime. A %0adecoction, too, of tithymalos 41 with resin is highly esteemed for %0athe same purpose. %0a%0aBut to all these remedies the plant known as “ lichen,” fro® %0a%0a36 In B. xxiv. c. 102. 37 In B. xxix. c. 5. %0a%0a33 See B. xxi. c. 68. 39 See B. xx. c. 85. %0a%0a40 “ Flos visci.” 41 See c. 39 of this Book. %0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 12.] %0a%0a%0aSCROFULA. %0a%0a%0a161 %0a%0a%0aits efficacy as a cure, is held in preference. It is found grow¬ %0aing among rocks, and has a single broad leaf 42 near the root, %0aand a single long stem, with small leaves hanging from it. %0aThis plant has the property also of effacing brand marks, %0abeing beaten up with honey for that purpose. There is another %0akind 43 of lichen also, which adheres entirely to rocks, like %0amoss, and which is equally used as a topical application. The %0ajuice of it, dropt into wounds, or applied to abscesses, has the %0aproperty of arresting haemorrhage: mixed with honey, it is %0acurative of jaundice, the face and tongue being rubbed with %0ait. Under this mode of treatment, the patient is recommended %0ato wash in salt water, to anoint himself with oil of almonds, %0aand to abstain from garden vegetables. For the cure of %0alichen, root of thapsia 44 is also used, bruised in honey. %0a%0aCHAP. 11.-QUINZY. %0a%0aFor the treatment of quinzy, we find argemonia 48 recom¬ %0amended, in wine; a decoction of hyssop, boiled with figs, %0aused as a gargle ; peucedanum , 46 with an equal proportion of %0asea-calf’s rennet; proserpinaca , 47 beaten up in the pickle of the %0amama 48 and oil, or else placed beneath the tongue; as also %0ajuice of cinquefoil, taken in doses of three cyathi. Used as a %0agargle, juice of cinquefoil is good for the cure of all affections %0aof the fauces : verbascum , 49 too, taken in wine, is particularly %0auseful for diseases of the tonsillary glands. %0a%0aCHAP. 12.

Dest'ontaines takes it to be either %0athe Marchantia conica, or the Peltidea canina. It must be remembered %0athat the Marchantia is not a Lichen in the modem acceptation of the word, %0aand that our Lichens are destitute of stem.

The large-leaved sideritis," %0acleft by the left hand with a nail, is worn attached as an %0aamulet: but after the cure has been effected, due care must be %0ataken to preserve the plant, in order that it may not be set %0aagain, to promote the wicked designs of the herbalists and so %0acause the disease to break out afresh ; as sometimes happens in %0athe cases already mentioned , 66 and others which I find stated, %0ain reference to persons cured by the agency of artemisia or %0aplantago. %0a%0aDamasonion , 57 also known as alcea, is gathered at the summer %0asolstice, and applied with rain-water, the leaves being beaten %0aup, or the root pounded, with axle-grease, so as to admit, when %0aapplied, of being covered with a leaf of the plant. The same %0aplan is adopted also for the cure of all pains in the neck, and %0atumours on all parts of the body. %0a%0aCHAP. 13. -THE PLANT CALLED BELLIS : TWO REMEDIES. %0a%0aBeilis 68 is the name of a plant that grows in the fields, with %0aa white flower somewhat inclining to red; if this is applied %0awith artemisia , 59 it is said, the remedy is still more efficacious. %0a%0aCHAP. 14.- THE CONDUKDUM. %0a%0aThe condurdum , 60 too, is a plant with a red blossom, whith %0aflowers at the summer solstice.

For the cure of this malady, root of pa¬ %0anaces 61 in sweet wine is used, and in cases where it is attended %0awith spitting of blood, juice of henbane. Henbane, too, used as %0aa fumigation, is good for cough; and the same with scordotis, 62 %0amixed with nasturtium and dry resin, beaten up with honey : %0aemployed by itself also, scordotis facilitates expectoration, a %0aproperty which is equally possessed by the greater centaury, %0aeven where the patient is troubled with spitting of blood ; for %0awhich last juice of plantago is very beneficial. Betony, taken %0ain doses of three oboli in water, is useful for purulent or %0abloody expectorations: root also of persolata, 6 * in doses of %0aone drachma, taken with eleven pine-nuts; and juice of peu- %0acedanum. 61 %0a%0aFor pains in the chest, acoron 65 is remarkably useful; hence %0ait is that it is so much used an ingredient in antidotes. For %0acough, daucus 66 and the plant scythice 61 are much employed, %0athis last being good, in fact, for all affections of the chest, %0acoughs, and purulent expectorations, taken in doses of three %0aoboli, with the same proportion of raisin wine. The verbas- %0acum 6g too, with a flower like gold, is similarly employed. %0a%0a(6.) This last-named plant is so remarkably energetic, that %0aan infusion of it, administered in their drink, will relieve %0abeasts of burden, not only when troubled with cough, but when %0abroken-winded even—a property which I find attributed to %0agentian also. Boot of cacalia 69 chewed, or steeped in wine, is %0agood for cough as well as all affections of the throat.

Wherever it is found growing wild, it is generally %0athought that there is a spring of water below, and it is looked %0aupon as a sure sign that such is the case, by persons in search' 1 %0aof water. The leaves are somewhat larger than those of %0aivy, and are some five or seven in number, of a whitish hue %0abeneath, and a pale green on the upper surface, The plant is %0adestitute of stem, blossom, and seed, and the root is very %0adiminutive. Some persons are of opinion that this bechion is %0aidentical with the arcion, known also as the “ channeleuce.” 77 %0aThe smoke 73 of this plant in a dry state, inhaled by the aid %0aof a reed and swallowed, is curative, they say, of chronic %0acough; it is necessary, however, at each inhalation to take a %0adraught of raisin wine. %0a%0aCHAP. 1 7.-THE BECHION, KNOWN ALSO AS SALVIA : FOUR %0a%0aREMEDIES. %0a%0aThere is another bechion 74 also, known to some persons as %0a“ salvia,” 75 and bearing a strong resemblance to verbascum. %0aThis plant is triturated, and the juice strained off and taken %0awarm for cough and for pains in the side: it is considered %0avery beneficial also for the stings of scorpions and sea- %0adragons. 76 It is a good plan, too, to rub the body with this %0ajuice, mixed with oil, as a preservative against the stings of %0aserpents. A bunch of hyssop is sometimes boiled down with %0aa quarter of a pound of honey, for the cure of cough. %0a%0aCHAP. 18.

For similar %0apurposes the greater centaury is used, in an electuary ; juice %0aalso of plantago, or else the plant itself, eaten with the food; %0apounded betony, in the proportion of one pound to half an %0aounce of Attic honey, taken daily in warm water ; and aristo¬ %0alochia 81 or agaric, taken in doses of three oboli, in warm water %0aor asses’ milk. %0a%0aFor hardness of breathing an infusion of cissanthemos 88 is %0ataken in drink, and for the same complaint, as also for asthma, %0ahyssop. For pains in the liver, chest, and side, if unattended %0awith fever, juice of peucedanum is used.

This plant is given, pounded, in astringent %0ared wine, for cough, asthma, and gripings in the bowels. It %0ais administered also in the form of a pottage, to which some %0awine should be added.

Root of betony acts as a gentle emetic, taken in %0athe same way as hellebore, in doses of four drachmae in %0araisin wine or, honied w'ine. Hyssop, too, is beaten up with %0ahoney for similar purposes; but it is more efficacious if nas¬ %0aturtium or irio 7 is taken first. %0a%0aMolemonium 8 is used as an emetic, being taken in doses of one %0adenarius ; the same, too, with sillybum. 9 Both of these plants %0ahave a milky juice, which thickens like gum, and is taken with %0ahoney in the proportions above-mentioned, being particularly %0agood for carrying off bile. On the other hand, vomiting is %0aarrested by the use of wild cummin or powdered betony, %0ataken in water. Crudities and distaste for food are dispelled, %0aand the digestion promoted by employing daucus, 10 powdered %0abetony 11 taken in hydromel, or else plantago boiled like %0agreens. Hiccup is arrested by taking hemionium 12 or aristo- %0alochia, 13 and asthma by the use of clymenus. 14 For pleurisy %0aand peripneumony, the greater centaury is used, or else %0ahyssop, taken in drink.

It carries off bile, and acts strongly as a purgative %0aupon the bowels; unless, indeed, aloes are added, in the propor¬ %0ation of two drachmae of aloes to two oboli of scammony. The %0adrug thus called is the juice of a plant that is branchy from %0athe root, and has unctuous, white, triangular, leaves, with %0aa solid, moist root, of a nauseous flavour: it grows in nch %0awhite soils. About the period of the rising of the Dog- %0astar, an excavation is made about the root, to let the juice %0acollect: which done, it is dried in the sun and divided into %0atablets. The root itself, too, or the outer coat of it, is some¬ %0atimes dried. The scammony most esteemed is that of Colophon, %0aMysia, and Priene. In appearance it ought to be smooth and %0ashiny, and as much like bull glue as possible : it should present %0aa fungous surface also, covered with minute holes ; should melt %0awith the greatest rapidity, have a powerful smell, and be sticky %0alike gum. "When touched with the tongue, it should give out %0aa white milky liquid; it ought also to be extremely light, and %0ato turn white when melted. %0a%0a75 It is for this reason that it is called “ reglisse,” or “ liquorice,” in %0asome parts of France. It contains a proportion of saccharine matter, %0awhich acts as a purgative. “ Pulticula.” %0a%0a17 This fancy is solely based on the accidental resemblance of the name. %0a%0a78 He very incorrectly says this of all the ferns.

The difference may be easily %0adetected, however, by the taste, as tithymalos imparts a burn¬ %0aing sensation to the tongue. To be fully efficacious, scammony %0ashould be two 81 years old; befpre or after that age it is useless. %0aIt has been prescribed to be taken by itself also, in doses of %0afour oboli, with hydromel and salt: but the most advanfageous %0amode of using it is in combination with aloes, care being taken %0ato drink honied wine the moment it begins to operate. The %0aroot, too, is boiled down in vinegar to the consistency of honey, %0aand the decoction used as a liniment for leprosy. The head is %0aalso rubbed with this decoction, mixed with oil, for head-ache. %0a%0aCHAr. 39.—TnE tithymalos characias. %0a%0aThe tithymalos is called by our people the “ milk plant,” 83 %0aand by some persons the “goat lettuce.” 83 They say, that if %0acharacters are traced upon the body with the milky juice of %0athis plant, and powdered with ashes, when dry, the letters will %0abe perfectly visible; an expedient which has been adopted %0abefore now by intriguers, for the purpose of communicating %0awith their mistresses, in preference to a correspondence by %0aletter. There are numerous varieties of this plant. 81 The %0afirst kind has the additional name of “ characias,” 85 and is %0agenerally looked upon as the male plant. Its branches are %0aabout a finger in thickness, red and full of juice, five or six in %0anumber, and a cubit in length. The leaves near the root are %0aalmost exactly those of the olive, and the extremity of the %0astem is surmounted with a tuft like that of the bulrush : it is %0afound growing in rugged localities near the sea-shore. The %0aseed is gathered in autumn, together with the tufts, and after %0abeing dried in the sun, is beaten out and put by for keeping. %0a%0a80 See the following Chapters. %0a%0a61 This assertion is erroneous; it has all its properties in full vigour im¬ %0amediately after extraction, and retains them for an indefinite period. %0a%0a83 “llcrba lactaria.” %0a%0a83 Because goats are fond of it.

Five drops are as much as each fig %0aought to receive; and the story is, that if a dropsical patient %0aeats one of these figs he will have as many motions as the fig %0ahas received drops. While the juice is being collected, due %0acare must be taken not to let it touch the eyes. From the leaves, %0apounded, a juice is also extracted, but not of so useful a %0anature as the other kind: a decoction, too, is made from the %0abranches. %0a%0aThe seed also is used, being boiled with honey and made up %0ainto purgative 86 pills. These seeds are sometimes inserted in %0ahollow teeth with wax : the teeth are rinsed too, with a de¬ %0acoction of the root in wine or oil. The juice is used externally %0afor lichens, and is taken internally both as an emetic and to %0apromote alvine evacuation : in other respects, it is prejudicial to %0athe stomach. Taken in drink, with the addition of salt, it car¬ %0aries off pituitous humours; and in combination with saltpetre,** %0aremoves bile. In cases where it is desirable that it should purge %0aby stool, it is taken with oxycrate, but where it is wanted %0ato act as an emetic, with raisin wine or hydromel; three oboli %0abeing a middling dose. The best method, however, of using it, %0ais to eat the prepared figs above-mentioned, just after taking %0afood. In taste, it is slightly burning to the throat; indeed it %0ais of so heating a nature, that, applied externally by itself, it %0araises blisters on the flesh, like those caused by the action of %0afire. Hence it is that it is sometimes employed as a cautery. %0a%0aCHAP. 40.— THE TITHYMALOS MYRTITES, OR CARY1TES ; TWK5TT- %0aONE REMEDIES. %0a%0aA second kind of tithymalos is called “ myrtites M87 by some %0apersons, and “ caryites ” by others. It has leaves like those %0aof myrtle, pointed and prickly, but with a softer surface, and %0agrows, like the one already mentioned, in rugged soils. The %0atufted heads of it are gathered just as barley is beginning to %0aswell in the ear, and, after being left for nine days in the shade, %0aare thoroughly dried in the sun.

Polerao- %0ailia 12 is taken in wine, and betony, in doses of one drachma, %0ain three cyathi of oxymel: aristolochia, too, is used in the %0asame manner as for injuries inflicted by serpents. 12 Arge- %0amonia, 14 it is said, taken with the food for seven consecutive %0adays, diminishes the volume of the spleen ; and a similar effect %0ais attributed to agaric, taken in doses of two oboli, in oxymel. %0aRoot, too, of nymphaea heraclia, 15 taken in wine, or by itself, %0adiminishes the spleen.- %0a%0aCissanthemos, 16 taken twice a day, in doses of one drachma %0ain two cyathi of white wine, for forty consecutive days, %0agradually carries off the spleen, it is said, by urine. Hyssop, %0aboiled with figs, is very useful for the same purpose: root of %0alonchitis, 17 also, boiled before it has shed its seed. A decoction %0aof root of peucedanum 18 is good for the spleen and kidneys. %0aAcoron, 19 taken in drink, diminishes the spleen ; and the roots %0aof it are very beneficial for the viscera and iliac regions. For %0asimilar purposes, seed of clymenus 20 is taken, for thirty con¬ %0asecutive days, in doses of one denarius, in white wine. Powdered %0abetony is also used, taken in a potion with honey and squill %0avinegar ; root too of lonchitis is taken in water.

This last plant is used also for hernia, %0aapplied topically or taken in drink : it is remarkably efficacious %0atoo for strangury. For calculi some persons recommend %0abetony, vervain, and milfoil, in equal proportions in water, as %0aa sovereign remedy. It is universally agreed that dittany is %0acurative of strangury, and that the same is the case with %0acinquefoil, boiled down to one third in wine : this last plant is %0avery useful, too, taken internally and applied topically, for %0arupture of the groin. %0a%0aThe upper part of the root of xiphion 26 has a diuretic effect %0aupon infants ; it is administered also in water for rupture of %0athe groin, and is applied topically for diseases of the bladder. %0aJuice of peucedanuni 21 is employed for hernia in infants, and %0apsyllion 28 is used as an application in cases of umbilical %0ahernia. The two kinds of anagallis 29 are diuretic, and a %0asimilar effect is produced by a decoction of root of acoron, 30 or %0athe plant itself bruised and taken in drink; this last is %0agood too for all affections of the bladder. ]3oth the stem and %0aroot of cotyledon 31 are used for the cure of calculi; and for all %0ainflammations of the genitals, myrrh is mixed in equal propor¬ %0ations with the stem and seed. The more tender leaves of %0aebulum, 3 '* beaten up and taken with wine, expel calculi of the %0abladder, and an application of them is curative of diseases of %0athe testes. Erigeron, 33 with powdered frankincense and sweet %0awine, is curative of inflammation of the testes; and root of %0asymphytum, 34 applied topically, reduces rupture of the groin. %0aThe white hypocisthis 35 is curative of corroding ulcers of the %0agenitals. Artemisia 36 is prescribed also in sweet wine for the %0acure of calculi and of strangury; and l-ootof nymphaea heraclia, 37 %0ataken in wine, allays pains in the bladder. %0a%0aCHAP. 50.- CKETUMOS: EEEVEN REMEDIES.

When dried, the seed bursts asunder, and discloses %0ain the interior a white kernel, known as “ cachry” to some. %0aThe leaf is unctuous and of a whitish colour, like that of the %0aolive, only thicker and of a saltish taste. The roots are three %0aor four in number, and about a finger in thickness: the plant %0agrows in rocky localities, upon the sea-shore. It is eaten raw %0aor else boiled w r ith cabbage, and has a pleasant, aromatic %0aflavour; it is preserved also in brine. %0a%0aThis plant is particularly useful for strangury, the leaves, %0astem, or root being taken in wine. It improves the complexion %0aof the skin also, but if taken in excess is very apt to produce %0aflatulency. Used in the form of a decoction it relaxes the %0abowels, has a diuretic effect, and carries off the humours from %0athe kidneys. The same is the case also with alcea: 43 dried and %0apowdered and taken in wine, it removes strangury, and, with %0athe addition of daucus, 41 is still more efficacious: it is good %0atoo for the spleen, and is taken in drink as an antidote to the %0avenom of serpents.

It is a plant 51 %0awith a stem like that 02 of a garden vegetable, thin, red, and a %0acubit in length. The leaf is similar to that of rue, and has %0aan acrid smell: the seed is enclosed in a swarthy pod, and %0aripens at the same time as barley. This seed is of an astringent %0anature, arrests diarrhoea, and acts as a diuretic: it is taken %0aalso for diseases of the bladder, in wine. %0a%0aCHAP. 54. —CAKOS OR HYPEKICON : TEN REMEDIES. %0a%0aThere is another hypericon also, known as “ caros” K by %0asome. The leaves of it resemble those of the tamarix, 64 %0abeneath 55 which it grows, but are more unctuous 56 and not so %0ared. It is an odoriferous plant, somewhat more than a palm 57 %0ain height, of a sweet llavour, and slightly pungent. The seed %0ais of a warming nature, and is consequently productive of eruc¬ %0atations; it is not, however, injurious to the stomach.

Some persons %0adescribe this plant as having a leaf like that of the squill, %0aonly smoother and softer, and a prickly stem. The roots heal %0aulcerations of the mouth, and are curative of pituitous dis¬ %0acharges from the chest; taken in wine they act astringently %0aupon the bowels. %0a%0aSatyrion is also a powerful stimulant. There are two kinds %0aof it: the first 6 has leaves like those of the olive, but longer, %0aa stem four fingers in length, a purple flower, and a double %0aroot, resembling the human testes in shape. This root swells %0aand increases in volume one year, and resumes its original %0asize the next. The other kind is known as the “ satyrios or¬ %0achis,” 7 and is supposed to be the female plant. It is dis¬ %0atinguished from the former one by the distance between its %0ajoints, and its more branchy" and shrublike form.

SATY¬ %0a%0aRION ERYTHRAICON I POUR MEDICINAL PROPERTIES. %0a%0aThe Greeks give the name of “satyrion” 10 to a plant with %0a%0acattle. It is the name, no doubt, signifying “ testicle,” which originally %0aprocured for it the repute of being an aphrodisiac. %0a%0a6 Identified by Desfontaines with the Orchis pyramidalis, and by Fe' %0awith the 0. papilionacea of Linnaeus. Littre gives the Limodorum abor- %0ativum. %0a%0a7 He is probably speaking of the Crataegonon of B. xxvii. c. 40, which %0aFee identifies with the Thelygonon of c. 91 of this Book. He remarks %0athat from the description, the Satyrios orchis cannot have been a Mono¬ %0acotyledon. %0a%0a8 See B. xviii. c. 14. 9 See B. viii. c. 72. %0a%0a10 Littre identifies it with the Aceras anthropophora of Linnceus; Des¬ %0afontaines with the Orchis bifolia, the Butterfly orchis.

The %0astem, they say, is smooth and bare and a cubit iu length, and %0athe root double ; the lower part, which is also the larger, pro¬ %0amoting the conception of male issue, the upper or smaller part, %0athat of female. %0a%0aThey distinguish also another kind of satyrion, by the %0aname of “ erythraicou :” H it has seed like that of the vitex, 12 %0aonly larger, smooth, and hard; the root, they say, is covered %0awith a red rind, and is white within and of a sweetish taste : %0ait is mostly found in mountainous districts. The root, we are %0atold, if only held in the hand, acts as a powerful aphrodisiac, %0aand even more so, if it is taken in rough, astringent wine. It %0ais administered in drink, they say, to rams and hc-goats when %0ainactive and sluggish ; and the people of Sarmatia are in the %0ahabit of giving it to their stallions when fatigued with cover¬ %0aing, a defect to which they give the name of “ prosedamum.” %0aThe effects of this plant are neutralized by the use of hydro- %0amel or lettuces. 13 %0a%0aThe Greeks, however, give the general name of "satyrion” %0ato all substances of a stimulating tendency, to the crataegis 1 * %0afor example, the thelygonon, 18 and the arrenogonon, plants, %0athe seed of which bears a resemblance to the testes. 16 Persons %0awho carry the pith of branches of tithymalos 17 about them, %0aare rendered more amorous thereby, it is said. The statements %0aare really incredible, which Theophrastus, 18 in most cases an %0aauthor of high authority, makes in relation to this subject; %0athus, for instance, he says that by the contact only of a cer- %0a%0aof Linnaeus has also been named ; but, though with some doubt, Fee is %0ainclined to prefer the Tulipa Clusiana, or some other kind of tulip. %0a%0a11 Mostly identified with the Erythroniuni dens canis of Linnaeus, the %0aLog’s tooth violet. M. Fraas, however, in his Synopsis, p. ‘279, remarks %0athat the E. dens canis is not to be found in Greece, and is of opinion that %0athe Fritillaria Pyrenaica, the Pyrenean lily, or Fritillary, is meant. The %0aSerapias cordigera of Linnaeus has been suggested, and Fee thinks that %0ait is as likely to be the plant meant by Pliny as any other that has been %0anamed. %0a%0a12 See B. xxiv. c. 38. 13 See B. xix. c. 38. %0a%0a14 “ Cratiegonon ” is most probably the correct reading.

Gout used to be an %0aextremely rare disease, not in the times of our fathers and %0agrandfathers only, but within my own memory even. Indeed, %0ait may justly be considered a foreign complaint; for if it had %0abeen formerly known in Italy, it would surely have found a %0aLatin name. It should, however, by no means be looked %0aupon as an incurable malady; for before now, in many in¬ %0astances, it has quitted the patient all at once, and still more %0afrequently, a cure has been effected by proper treatment. %0a%0aLor the cure of gout, roots of panaces 20 are used, mixed with %0araisins; juice of henbane, or the seed, combined with meal; %0ascordion, 21 taken in vinegar; iberis, as already mentioned; 3 %0avervain, beaten up with axle-grease ; or root of cyclaminos, 3 %0aa decoction of which is good also for chilblains. %0a%0aAs cooling applications for gout, root of xiphion 24 is used; %0aseed of psyllion ; 25 hemlock, with litharge or axle-grease; %0aand, at the first symptoms of red gout, or, in other words, hot %0agout, the plant aizoum. 26 For either kind of gout, erigeron, 21 %0awith axle-grease, is very useful; leaves of plantago, beaten up %0awith a little salt; or argemonia, 28 pounded with honey. An %0aapplication of vervain is also remedial, and it is a good plan %0ato soak the feet in a decoction of that plant in water. %0a%0aCHAP. 65.- LAPPAGO OR MOLLUGO : ONE REMEDY.

It resembles %0athe lettuce in appearance, and is used as the basis in dyeing %0atissues with the purple of the murex. 34 Used before it be¬ %0acomes dry, it is efficacious as a topical application not only %0afor gout, but for all diseases of the joints. There are three %0akinds of it; one with a broad leaf, another with a longer leaf %0aof a reddish hue, and a third with a crisped leaf, and used in %0aCrete for dyeing cloths. 35 All these kinds have similar pro¬ %0aperties ; and we find Nicauder prescribing them in wine as an %0aantidote to the venom of serpents even. The seed also of the %0aplant which we have spoken of as “ psyllion,” 36 is useful for %0athe cure of gout: it is first steeped in water, and one hemina of %0athe seed is then mixed with two spoonfuls of resin of Colophon, %0aand one spoonful of frankincense. Leaves of mandragora, 37 %0atoo, are highly esteemed for this purpose, beaten up with %0apolenta. %0a%0a(11.) For swellings of the ankles, slime, 38 kneaded up with %0aoil, is wonderfully useful, and for swellings of the joints the %0ajuice of the smaller centaury ; this last being remarkably good %0aalso for diseases of the sinews.

The %0afollowing I find mentioned as general remedies : in preference %0ato anything else, an infusion of dodecatheos, 52 a plant already %0adescribed, should be taken in drink, and then the roots of the %0aseveral kinds 53 of panaces, in maladies of long standing more %0aparticularly : seed, too, of panaces should be used for intestinal %0acomplaints. For all painful affections of the body we find %0ajuice of scordium 34 recommended, as also that of betony : this %0alast, taken in a potion, is particularly excellent for removing %0aa wan and leaden hue of the skin, and for improving its gene¬ %0aral appearance. %0a%0a40 See c. 19 of this Book. 41 See B. xviii. c. 14. %0a%0a42 See B. xx. c. 2. 43 See c. 37 of this Book. %0a%0a44 See B. xii. c. 28. 45 Seo B. xxiv. c. 88. %0a%0a46 “ Ox lappa.” Possibly the same as the Philanthropos, or else the %0a%0aLappa canina, both mentioned in B. xxiv. c. 116. %0a%0a47 See B. xxv. c. 67 . 48 See B. xxv. c. 101. %0a%0a49 See B. xxv. c. 109. %0a%0a50 See B. xii. c. 37, and c. 35 of this Book. %0a%0a61 See B. viii. c. 47. 52 See B. xxv. c. 9. %0a%0a33 See B. xxv. c. 11, et seq. 54 See B. xxv. c. 27. %0a%0a%0aChap. 68.] T1IE GEBANIOW. 195 %0a%0aCHAP. 68.-THE GERANION, MYRRHIS, OR MYRTIS ; THREE VARIE¬ %0a%0aTIES OF IT : SIX REMEDIES. %0a%0aThe plant geranion has the additional names of “ myrrhis” 54 ' %0aand “myrtis.” It is similar to hemlock in appearance, but %0ahas a smaller leaf and a shorter stem, rounded, and of a plea¬ %0asant taste and odour. Such, at all events, is the description %0agiven of it by our herbalists; but the Greeks speak of it as %0abearing leaves a little whiter than those of the mallow, thin %0adowny stems, and branches at intervals some two palms in %0alength, with small heads at their extremities, in the midst %0aof the leaves, resembling the bill 55 of a crane. 56 There is also %0aanother 57 variety of this plant, with leaves like those of the %0aanemone, but with deeper incisions, and a root rounded like %0aan apple, sweet, and extremely useful and refreshing 53 for %0ainvalids when recovering their strength; this last would al¬ %0amost seem to be the true geranion. %0a%0aFor phthisis this plant is taken, in the proportion of one %0adrachma to three cyathi of wine, twice a day; as also for %0aflatulency. Eaten raw, it is productive of similar effects. The %0ajuice of the root is remedial for diseases of the ear ; and for %0aopisthotony the seed is taken in drink, in doses of four drachmae, %0awith pepper and myrrh. Juice of plantago, 59 taken in drink, %0ais curative of phthisis, and a decoction of it is equally good for %0athe purpose. Plantago taken as a food w T ith oil and salt, %0aimmediately after rising in the morning, is extremely refreshing; %0ait is prescribed, too, in cases of atrophy, on alternate days. %0aBetony is given with honey, in the form of an electuary, for %0aphthisis, in pieces the size of a bean ; agaric, too, is taken in %0adoses of two oboli in raisiu wine, or else daucus 60 with the %0agreater centaury in wine.

Aizoiira, or houseleek, %0ais beneficial, wrapped in black cloth and placed beneath the %0apillow, without the patient being aware of it. The onotheras" %0atoo, or onear, taken in wine, has certain exhilarating pro¬ %0aperties ; it has leaves like those of the almond tree, a rose- %0acoloured fiower, numerous branches, and a long root, with a %0avinous smell when dried: an infusion of this root has a %0asoothing effect upon wild beasts even. %0a%0aFor fits of indigestion 67 attended with nausea, betony is %0ataken in drink: used similarly after the evening meal, it faci¬ %0alitates the digestion. Taken in the proportion of one drachma %0ato three cyathi of oxymel, it dispels crapulence. The same is %0athe case, too, with agaric, taken in warm water after eating. %0aBetony is curative of paralysis, it is said; the same, too, with %0aiberis, as already stated. 68 This last is good, too, for numbness %0aof the limbs ; the same being the case with argemonia, w a %0aplant which disperses those affections which might otherwise %0anecessitate the application of the knife. %0a%0aCHAP. 70.- REMEDIES FOR EPILEPSY. %0a%0aEpilepsy is cured by the root of the panaces which we have %0aspoken 70 of as the “ heraclion,” taken in drink with sea-calf’s %0arennet, the proportions being three parts of panaces and one of %0arennet.

It is a good plan too to use fomentations with %0amyrtle w'ine : two ounces of mint beaten up in vinegar with %0aone ounce of live sulphur, form a mixture sometimes employed; %0aas also soot mixed with vinegar. %0a%0aThere are several kinds of erysipelas, one in particular %0awhich attacks the middle of the body, and is known as %0a“zoster:” 3 should it entirely surround the body, its effects are %0a%0a%0a•* See B. xxv. c. 90. %0a%0a90 See B. xxv. c. 101. %0a%0a92 See c. 44 of this Book. %0a%0aM See B. xxv. c. 71. %0a%0a96 See B. xxv. c. 67. %0a%0a98 See B. xxi. c. 105. %0a%0a1 See B. xxv. c. 94. %0a%0a3 The “ belt ”—known to us as %0a%0a%0a69 See B. xxv. c. 92. %0a%0a91 See B. xxv. c. 71. %0a%0a93 See c. 54 of this Book. %0a95 See B. xxv. c. 71. %0ar ‘ See B. xxv. c. 71. %0a%0a99 See B. xxv. c. 102. %0a%0a2 Or Grape-juice. %0a%0a“ shingles.” %0a%0a%0a200 %0a%0a%0aplint’s natural history. %0a%0a%0a[Book XXVI. %0a%0a%0afatal.

(12.) -REMEDIES FOR SPRAINS. %0a%0aFor the cure of sprains, root of polypodion 10 is used, in the %0aform of a liniment: the pain and swelling are modified also by %0ausing seed of psyllion ; u leaves of plantago 12 beaten up with %0aa little salt; seed of verbascum, 13 boiled in wine and pounded; %0aor hemlock, with axle-grease. Leaves of ephemcron 1 * are applied %0atopically to tumours and tuberosities, so long as they are %0acapable of being dispersed. %0a%0aCHAP. 76. -REMEDIES FOR JAUNDICE. %0a%0aIt is upon the eyes in particular that jaundice is productive %0aof so remarkable an effect; the bile penetrating between the %0amembranes, so extremely delicate as they are and so closely %0aunited. Hippocrates 15 tells us that the appearance of jaundice %0aon or after the seventh day in fevers is a fatal symptom; but %0aI am acquainted with some instances in which the patients %0asurvived after having been reduced to this apparently hopeless %0astate. We may remark also, that jaundice sometimes comes %0aon without fever supervening. It is combated by taking the %0agreater centaury, 16 as already mentioned, in drink ; agaric, in %0adoses of three oboli in old wine; or leaves of vervain, in doses %0aof three oboli, taken for four consecutive days in one hemina of %0amulled wine. But the most speedy cure of all is effected by %0ausing juice of cinquefoil, in doses of three cyathi, with salt %0aand honey. Boot of cyclaminos 11 is also taken in drink in %0adoses of three drachmae, the patient sitting in a warm room %0afree from all cold and draughts, the infusion expelling the %0abile by its action as a sudorific. %0a%0a%0a4 See B. xxv. c. 39. %0a%0a6 See B. xxv. c. 66. %0a%0a8 See B. xxv. c. 102. %0a%0a10 See c. 37 of this Book. %0a12 See B. xxv. c. 39. %0a%0a14 See B. xxv. c. 107. %0a%0a16 See B. xxv. c. 3'J. %0a%0a%0a5 See B. xxxv. c. 57. %0a%0aI See B. xxv. c. 101. %0a9 See B. xxv. c. 18. %0a%0aII See B. xxv. c. 90. %0a13 See B. xxv. c. 73. %0a13 B. iv. cc. 62, 64. %0a%0a17 See B. xxv. c. 67. %0a%0a%0a'hap. 79.] %0a%0a%0aREMEDIES FOE ABSCESSES. %0a%0a%0a201 %0a%0a%0aLeaves of tussilago 18 are also used in water for this purpose ; %0athe seed of either kind of linozostis, 19 sprinkled in the drink, or %0amade into a decoction with chick-pease or wormwood : hyssop %0aberries taken in water; the plant lichen,'- 0 all other vege¬ %0atables being carefully abstained from while it is being used; %0apolythrix, 21 taken in wine; and struthion, 22 in honied wine. %0a%0aCHAP. 77. -KEMEDIES FOE BOILS. %0a%0aThere are boils also, known as “ furunculi,” 23 which make %0atheir appearunce indiscriminately on all parts of the body, and %0aare productive of the greatest inconvenience: sometimes %0aindeed, when the constitution is exhausted, they are fatal in %0atheir effects. For their cure, leaves of pycnocomon 24 are em¬ %0aployed, beaten up with polenta, 25 if the boil has not come to a %0abead.

Fraas identifies %0ait with the Equisaetum limosum of Linnaeus. %0a%0a73 Whence its name “ equisaetum.” %0a%0a71 See B. xi. c. 30. %0a%0a%0a204 %0a%0a%0apliny’s natural history. %0a%0a%0a[Book XXVI. %0a%0a%0apurpose it is boiled down in a new earthen vessel to one third, %0athe vessel being filled to the brim, and the decoction taken %0ain doses of one hemina for three successive days. It is strictly %0aforbidden, however, to eat any food of a greasy nature the day %0abefore taking it. %0a%0aAmong the Greeks there are various opinions in relation to %0athis plant. According to some, who give it the same name of %0a“ hippuris,” it has leaves like those of the pine tree, and of a %0aswarthy hue; and, if we are to believe them, it is possessed of %0avirtues of such a marvellous nature, that if touched by the %0apatient only, it will arrest haemorrhage. Some authorities call it %0a“hippuris,’’others, again, “ ephedron,” and others “anabasis;” %0aand they tell us that it grows near trees, the trunks of which it %0aascends, and hangs down therefrom in numerous tufts of black, %0arush-like hair, much like a horse’s tail in appearance. The %0abranches, we are told, are thin and articulated, and the leaves, %0afew in number, small, and thin, the seed round, and similar to %0acoriander in appearance, and the root ligneous: it grows, they %0asay, in plantations more particularly. %0a%0aThis plant is possessed of astringent properties. The juice %0aof it, kept in the nostrils, arrests bleeding therefrom, and it %0aacts astringently upon the bowels. Taken in doses of three %0acyathi, in sweet wine, it is a cure for dysentery, is an efficient %0adiuretic, and is curative of cough, hardness of breathing, rup¬ %0atures, and serpiginous affections. For diseases of the intestines %0aand bladder, the leaves are taken in drink; it has the property, %0aalso, of reducing ruptures of the groin. %0a%0aThe Greek writers describe another 15 hippuris, also, with %0ashorter tufts, softer and whiter. This last, they say, is remark¬ %0aably good for sciatica, and, applied with vinegar, for wounds, %0ait having the property of stanching the blood. Bruised nyrn- %0apluea 16 is also applied to wounds. Peucedanum 17 is taken in drink %0awith cypress seed, for discharges of blood at the mouth or by %0athe lower passages. Sideritis 79 is possessed of such remark¬ %0aable virtues, that applied to the wound of a gladiator just %0ainflicted, it will stop the flow of blood; an effect which is equally %0aproduced by an application of charred fennel-giant, or of the %0a%0a75 Identified by Littre with the Ephedra fragilis of Linnaeus.

(14.) -REMEDIES FOR ULCERS AND WOUNDS. %0a%0aOf ulcers there are numerous kinds, which are treated in %0avarious ways. The root of all the varieties of panaces 97 is %0aused as an application for running ulcers, in warm wine. %0a%0aThat which we have spoken of as the “ chironion” 98 is par¬ %0aticularly good as a desiccative: bruised with honey, it opens %0atumours, and is useful for serpiginoyus ulcers, the cure ofwhich %0aappears more than doubtful; in which case it is amalgamate! %0awith flower 99 of copper tempered with wine, either the seed, %0aflower, or root, being employed for the purpose. Mixed with %0apolenta 1 it is good for old wounds. The following are also %0agood detergents for wounds : heraclion siderion, 2 apollinaris/ %0apsyllion, 4 tragacantha, 6 and scordotis 6 mixed with honey. %0aPowdered scordotis, applied by itself, consumes fleshy excres¬ %0acences on the body. Polemonia 7 is curative of the malignant %0aulcer known as “ cacoethes.” The greater centaury, 8 sprinkled %0ain powder, or applied in the form of a liniment, or the leaves of %0athe smaller 9 centaury, boiled or pounded, act as a detergent %0aupon inveterate ulcers, and effect a cure. To recent wounds, %0athe follicules of the clymenus 10 are applied. Gentian is applied %0ato serpiginous ulcers, the root being bruised or else boiled down %0ain water to the consistency of honey ; the juice also of the %0aplant is employed. For wounds, a kind of lycium 11 is prepared %0afrom gentian. %0a%0a%0a95 See B. xi. c. 39, and B. xx. c. 32 . 96 See B. xxiii. c. 13. %0a%0a97 See B. xxv. c. 11, et seq. 98 See B. xxv. c. 15. %0a%0a99 For a description of this substance, see B. xxxiv. c. 24. %0a%0a1 See B. xviii. c. 14. 2 See B. xxv. c. 15. %0a%0a3 See B. xxv. c. 17. 4 See B. xxv. c. 90. %0a%0a8 See B. xiii. c. 36. 6 See B. xxv. c. 27. %0a%0a7 See B. xxv. c. 28. 8 See B. xxv. c. 30. %0a%0a9 See B. xxv. c. 31. 10 See B. xxv. c. 33. %0a%0a%0a11 See B. xxiv. c. 77. %0a%0a%0aREMEDIES FOR ULCERS. %0a%0a%0a207 %0a%0a%0aChap. 87.] %0a%0aLysiraachia 12 is curative of recent wounds, and plantago 13 of %0aall kinds of ulcerations,those on females, infants, and aged per¬ %0asons more particularly. This plant, when softened by the action %0aof fire, is better still: in combination with cerate it acts as a %0adetergent upon ulcers with indurated edges, and arrests the %0aprogress of corrosive sores: when applied bruised, it should be %0acovered with its own leaves. Chelidonia 14 also acts as a %0adesiccative upon suppurations, abscesses, and fistulous ulcers ; %0aindeed, it is so remarkably useful for the cure of wounds, as %0ato be employed as a substitute for spodium 15 even. In cases %0awhere the cure is almost hopeless, it is applied with axle- %0agrease. Dittany, 16 taken internally, causes arrows to fall from %0athe flesh ; used as a liniment, it has the effect of extracting other %0akinds of pointed weapons: the leaves are taken in the pro¬ %0aportion of one obolus to one cyathus of water. Nearly equal %0ain its efficacy is pseudo-dictamnon : 17 they are both of them %0auseful, also, for dispersing suppurations. %0a%0aAristolochia 18 cauterizes putrid sores, and, applied with honey, %0aacts as a detergent upon sordid ulcers. At the same time also, %0ait removes maggots, and extracts hard cores, and all foreign %0abodies adhering to the flesh, arrows more particularly, and, %0aapplied with resin, splintered bones. Used by itself, it fills the %0acavities made by ulcers with new flesh, and, employed with %0ahis, 19 in vinegar, it closes recent wounds. Vervain, or cinque¬ %0afoil with salt and honey, is remedial for ulcers of long stand¬ %0aing. Roots of persolata 20 are applied to recent wounds in¬ %0aflicted with iron, but for old wounds, it is the leaves that are %0aemployed : in both cases, in combination with axle-grease, the %0asore being then covered with the leaves of the plant. Damaso- %0aniunr 1 is used for wounds the same way as for scrofula, 22 and %0aleaves of verbascum 23 are employed with vinegar or wine. %0a%0aVervain is useful for all kinds of callosities or putrid sores; %0aroot of nymphaea heraclia 24 is curative of running ulcers ; and %0a%0a12 See B. xxv. c. 35. 13 See B. xxv. c. 39. %0a%0a14 See B. xxv. c. 50. %0a%0a15 See B. xix. c. 4, B. xxiii. c. 35, and B. xxxiv. c. 52. %0a%0a16 See B. xxv. c. 53. %0a%0a17 Bastard dittany.

This last root %0ais useful also for the cure of steatomatous tumours, and hyssop %0afor that of running ulcers ; an effect equally produced by peu- %0acedanum, 26 a plant which exercises so powerful an influence upon %0afresh wounds, as to cause exfoliation even of the bones. The two %0avarieties of anagallis 27 are possessed of similar properties, and %0aact as a check upon the corrosive sores known as “ nomse” and %0aupon defluxions; they are useful also in cases of recent wounds, %0athose of aged people in particular. Fresh leaves of raandra- %0agora, 28 applied with cerate, are curative of apostemes and %0asordid ulcers: the root too is used, with honey or oil, for wounds. %0a%0aHemlock, incorporated w r ith flour of winter wheat 29 by the %0aagency of wine—as also the plant aizoum 30 —is curative of her¬ %0apetic eruptions, and corrosive or putrid sores. Erigeron 11 %0ais employed for ulcers which breed maggots, ltoot of astra¬ %0agalus 32 is used for the cure of recent wounds or of ulcers of %0along standing ; and upon these last either kind of hypocisthis 33 %0aacts as a detergent. Seed of leontopodium, 34 bruised in water %0aand applied with polenta, 34 extracts pointed weapons from the %0aflesh : a result equally produced by using seed of pycnocomon/' %0aThe tithymalos characias 37 supplies its juice for the cure of gan¬ %0agrenes, phagedaenic sores, and putrid ulcers; or else a decoction %0ais made of the branches with polenta and oil. ltoots of or¬ %0achis 38 have a similar effect; in addition to which, applied, %0aeither dry or fresh gathered, with honey and vinegar, they are %0acurative of the ulcer known as “ cacoethes.” Onothera 39 also, %0aused by itself, is curative of ulcers when rapidly gaining head. %0a%0aThe people of Scythia employ scythice 40 for the treatment %0aof wounds.

Seed of %0apanaces, 68 mixed with wormwood, acts as an emmenagogue and %0aas a sudorific: the same, too, with scordotis, 69 taken internally %0aor applied topically. Betony, in doses of one drachma to %0athree cyathi of wine, is taken for various affections of the %0auterus, as also directly after child-birth. Excessive menstru¬ %0aation is arrested by a pessary of achillea, 70 or else a sitting-bath %0acomposed of a decoction of that plant. Seed of henbane in %0awine is used as a liniment for diseases of the mamillae, %0aand the root is employed in the form of a plaster for uterine %0aaffections; chelidonia, 71 too, is applied to the mamillae. %0a%0aRoots of panaces, 72 applied as a pessary, bring away the %0aafter-birth and the dead foetus, and the plant itself, taken in %0awine, or used as a pessary with honey, acts as a detergent %0aupon the uterus. Polemonia, 73 taken in wine, brings away the %0aafter-birth; used as a fumigation, it is good for suffocations of %0athe uterus. Juice of the smaller centaury, 74 taken in drink, or %0aemployed as a fomentation, acts as an emmenagogue. The root %0aalso of the larger centaury, similarly used, is good for pains in %0athe uterus; scraped and used as a pessary, it expels the %0adead foetus. For pains of the uterus, plantago 75 is applied as %0aa pessary, in wool, and for hysterical suffocations, it is taken in %0a%0a%0a61 See B. xxv. c. 18. %0a63 “Pterygia.” %0a%0a65 See B. xxv. c. 81. %0a67 See B. xxv. c, 10. %0a69 See B. xxv. c. 27. %0a11 See B. xxv. c. 50. %0a13 See B. xxv. c. 28. %0a75 See B. xxv. c. 39. %0a%0a%0a62 See c. 39 of this Book, et seq. %0a%0a64 See B. xii. c. 37 and c. 30 of this Book. %0a66 See B. xxii. c. 71. %0a%0a68 See B. xxv. c. 11, et seq. %0a%0a70 See B. xxv. c. 19. %0a%0a72 See B. xxv. c. 11, et seq. %0a%0a74 See B. xxv. c. 31. %0a%0a%0aChap. 90.] EEMEDIES FOE FEMALE DISEASES. %0a%0a%0a211 %0a%0a%0adrink. But it is dittany that is of the greatest efficacy in cases %0aof this description; it acts as an emmenagogue, and is an ex- %0apellent of the foetus when dead or lying transversely in the %0auterus. In these cases the leaves of it are taken, in doses of %0aone obolus, in water: indeed so active is it in its effects that %0aordinarily it is forbidden to be introduced into the chamber of %0aa woman lying-in. Not only is it thus efficacious when taken %0ain drink, but even when applied topically or used as a fumiga¬ %0ation. Pseudodictamnum 76 possesses pretty nearly the same vir¬ %0atues, but it acts as an emmenagogue also, boiled in doses of one %0adenarius in unmixed wine. Aristolochia , 77 however, is employed %0afor a greater number of purposes: in combination with myrrh %0aand pepper, either taken in drink or used as a pessary, it acts %0aas a powerful emmenagogue, and brings away the dead foetus %0aand the after-birth. This plant, the smaller kind in particular, %0aused either as a fomentation, fumigation, or pessary, acts as a %0apreventive of procidence of the uterus. %0a%0aHysterical suffocations and irregularities of the catamenia %0aare treated with agaric, taken in doses of three oboli, in one %0acyathus of old wine : vervain is used also in similar cases, as a %0apessary, with fresh hog’s lard ; or else antirrhinum , 78 with rose %0aoil and honey. Root of Thessalian nymphaea , 79 used as a %0apessary, is curative of pains in the uterus ; taken in red wine, %0ait arrests uterine discharges. Root of cyclaminos , 80 on the %0aother hand, taken in drink and employed as a pessary, acts as %0aan emmenagogue: a decoction of it, used as a sitting-bath, %0acures affections of the bladder. Cissanthemos , 81 taken in drink, %0abrings away the after-birth, and is curative of diseases of the %0auterus. The upper part of the root of xiphion , 82 taken in %0adoses of one drachma, in vinegar, promotes menstruation. A %0afumigation of burnt peucedanum 83 has a soothing effect in %0acases of hysterical suffocation. Psyllion , 84 taken in the pro¬ %0aportion of one drachma to three cyathi of hydromel, is par¬ %0aticularly good for promoting the lochial discharge. Seed of %0amandragora , 86 taken in drink, acts as a detergent upon the %0a%0a%0a,B “ Bastard dittany."

The seed of this plant, used with %0alive sulphur , 66 arrests menstruation when in excess; while ba- %0atrachion , 87 on the other hand, acts as an emmenagogue. This %0alast plant is either used as an article of food, or is taken in %0adrink: in a raw state, as already stated , 88 it has a burning %0aflavour ; but when cooked, the taste of it is greatly improved by %0athe addition of salt, oil, and cummin. Daucus , 89 taken in drink, %0apromotes the catamenia, and is an expellent of the after-birth %0ain a very high degree. Ladanum , 90 used as a fumigation, acts %0aas a corrective upon the uterus, and is employed topically for %0apains and ulcerations of that organ. %0a%0aScammony, taken in drink or used as a pessary, is an ex¬ %0apellent of the dead foetus. Either kind of hypericon , 91 used %0aas a pessary, promotes menstruation: but for this purpose it %0ais crethmos , 92 according to Hippocrates, that is the most effica¬ %0acious, the seed or root of it being taken in wine . 93 * * * %0aof the outer coat brings away the after-birth. This plant, %0ataken in water, is good for hysterical suffocations; root of %0ageranion 94 also, which is peculiarly useful for the after-birth, %0aand for inflation of the uterus. Hippuris , 95 taken in drink %0aor applied as a pessary, acts as a detergent upon the uterus: %0apolygonos , 96 taken in drink, promotes menstruation ; and the %0asame with root of alcima . 97 Leaves of plantago , 98 and agaric %0ain hydromel, have a similar effect. Artemisia , 99 bruised and %0aapplied as a pessary, with oil of iris , 1 figs, or myrrh, is curative %0aof diseases of the uterus; the root, too, of this plant, taken %0ain drink, is so strongly purgative as to expel the dead foetus %0aeven.

Callithrix , 6 applied as a fomentation, is curative %0aof affections of the vagina: it removes scaly eruptions 7 also %0aof the head, and, beaten up in oil, it stains the hair. Ge- %0aranion , 8 taken in white wine, or hypocisthis 9 in red, arrests %0aall uterine discharges. Hyssop modifies hysterical suffocations. %0aLoot of vervain, taken in water, is a most excellent remedy %0afor all accidents incident to, or consequent upon, delivery. %0aSome persons mix bruised cypress seed with peucedanum 10 in %0ared wine. Seed, too, of psyllion , 11 boiled in water and taken %0awarm, has a soothing effect upon all defluxions of the uterus. %0aSymphjffon , 12 bruised in wine, promotes menstruation. Juice %0aof scordotis , 13 in the proportion of one drachma to four cyathi %0aof hydromel, accelerates delivery. Leaves of dittany are given %0afor the same purpose, in water, with remarkable success. It %0ais a well-known fact, too, that these leaves, to the extent of a %0asingle obolus even, will bring away the foetus instantaneously, %0aeven when dead, without the slightest inconvenience to the %0apatient.

(1.)—NEW FORMS OF DISF.ASE. %0a%3c %0a%3c The face of man has recently been sensible of new forms of %0a%3c disease, unknown 1 in ancient times, not only to Italy, but to %0a%3c almost the whole of Europe. Still, however, they have not as %0a%3c yet extended to the whole of Italy, nor have they made any %0a%3c very great inroads in Illyricum, Gaul, or Spain, or indeed %0a%3c any other parts, to so great an extent as in Rome and its en¬ %0a%3c virons. Though unattended with pain, and not dangerous to %0a%3c life, these diseases are of so loathsome a nature, that any form %0a%3c of death would be preferable to them. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 2.-THE NATURE OF LICHEN. %0a%3c %0a%3c The most insupportable of all these diseases is the one which, %0a%3c after its Greek appellation, is known to us as “ lichen.” 1 In %0a%3c consequence, however, of its generally making its first appear¬ %0a%3c ance at the chin, the Latins, by way of joke, originally— so %0a%3c prone are'maukind to make a jest of the misfortunes of others %0a%3c —gave it the name of “ mentagra ;” 2 an appellation which has %0a%3c since become established in general use. In many cases, how¬ %0a%3c ever, this disease spreads over the interior of the mouth, and %0a%3c takes possession of the whole face, with the sole exception of %0a%3c the eyes ; after which, it passes downwards to the neck, breast, %0a%3c and hands, covering them with foul furfuraceous eruptions. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 3.-AT WHAT PERIOB LICHEN FIRST MADE ITS APPEARANCE %0a%3c %0a%3c IN ITALY. %0a%3c %0a%3c This curse was unknown to the ancients, 3 and in the times of %0a%3c our fathers even, having first entered Italy in the middle of %0a%3c %0a%3c 1 Probably as Littre suggests, a peculiar form of elephantiasis, the %0a%3c leprosy of the middle ages. %0a%3c %0a%3c i The “chin disease from “ mentum,” tbe “ chin.” It is difficult to %0a%3c detect the joke which has here incurred the censure of our author. %0a%3c %0a%3c 3 Meaning the people of Italy. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 3.] WHEN LICHEN FIUST APPEAHED IN ITALY. 153 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c the reign of the Emperor Tiberius 4 * Claudius Caesar; where %0a%3c it was introduced from Asia, 4 * in which country it had lately %0a%3c made* its appearance, by a member of the equestrian order at %0a%3c Rome, a native of Perusium, secretary to the quaestor. The %0a%3c disease, however, did not attack either females or slaves, 6 7 %0a%3c nor yet the lower orders, or, indeed, the middle classes, but %0a%3c only the nobles, being communicated even by the momentary %0a%3c contact requisite for the act of salutation. 1 Many of those %0a%3c who persevered in undergoing a course of remedial treatment, %0a%3c though cured of the disease, retained scars upon the body more %0a%3c hideous even than the malady itself; it being treated with %0a%3c cauteries, as it was certain to break out afresh, unless means %0a%3c were adopted for burning it out of the body by cauterizing to %0a%3c the very bone. %0a%3c %0a%3c Upon this occasion several physicians repaired to Pome %0a%3c from Egypt, that fruitful parent of maladies of this nature, %0a%3c men who devoted themselves solely to this branch of medical %0a%3c practice; and very considerable were the profits they made. %0a%3c At all events, it is a well-known fact that Manilius Cornutus, %0a%3c a personage of praetorian rank, and legatus of the province of %0a%3c Aquitania, expended no less a sum than two hundred thou¬ %0a%3c sand 8 sesterces upon his cure. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is much more frequently, on the other hand, that we hear %0a%3c of new forms of diseases attacking the lower orders; a singular %0a%3c fact, and one quite unequalled for the marvellous phaenomena %0a%3c which sometimes attend these outbreaks. Thus, for instance, %0a%3c we find an epidemic suddenly making its appearance in a cer¬ %0a%3c tain country, and then confining itself, as though it had made %0a%3c its election so to do, to certain parts of the body, certain ages, %0a%3c and even certain pursuits in life. In the same way, too, while %0a%3c %0a%3c 4 It is somewhat difficult to say whether Tiberius, the predecessor, or %0a%3c Claudius, the successor of Caligula, is meant; most probably the latter, %0a%3c as the former’s reign would have been in the times of “ our fathers.” %0a%3c %0a%3c 4 * Asia Minor. %0a%3c %0a%3c 6 “ Cum apparuisset.” He is probably wrong here, for leprosy was %0a%3c known in Asia from the very earliest times. %0a%3c %0a%3c 6 This assertion as to the slaves and lower orders is somewhat doubtful, %0a%3c though it is very possible that the diet and habits of the higher orders %0a%3c umy have predisposed them more particularly for the attacks of the diseases. %0a%3c %0a%3c 7 “Osculi,” “kissing;” a nauseous and silly practice, still adhered to, %0a%3c between bearded men even, in many parts of Europe. %0a%3c %0a%3c 11 Upwards of £1500. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 154 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c pliny’s natural history. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XXVI. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c one class of diseases attacks the young, another confines itself %0a%3c to adults ; while one malady extends itself only to the hightr %0a%3c classes, another is felt exclusively by the poor. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 4 .- CARBUNCLE. %0a%3c %0a%3c We find it stated in the Annals, that it was in the censorship 1 %0a%3c of L. Paulus and Q. Marcius that carbuncle 10 was first intro- %0a%3c duced into Italy, a malady which till then had confined itself %0a%3c solely to the province of Gallia Narbonensis. In the year %0a%3c in which I am writing these lines, two persons of consular %0a%3c rank have died of this disease, Julius Rufus 11 and Q. Lecanius %0a%3c Bassus ; 12 the former in consequence of an incision unskilfully %0a%3c made by his medical attendants, the latter through a wound %0a%3c upon the thumb of the left hand by pricking a carbuncle with %0a%3c a needle, a wound so small originally as to be hardly percep¬ %0a%3c tible. %0a%3c %0a%3c This disease makes its appearance in the more hidden 13 parts %0a%3c of the human, body, and mostly beneath the tongue. It ori¬ %0a%3c ginally has the form of a hard, red, pimple, with a blackish %0a%3c head mostly, though sometimes of a livid colour. It produces %0a%3c tension of the flesh, but unattended with swelling, pain, or %0a%3c any itching sensation ; indeed, the only symptom that accom¬ %0a%3c panies it is a confirmed drowsiness, which overpowers the pa- %0a%3c tient, and carries him off in the course of three days. Some¬ %0a%3c times, however, it is accompanied with shuddering, and small %0a%3c pustules about the sore ; and occasionally, though but rarely, %0a%3c with fever. When these symptoms extend to the fauces and %0a%3c oesophagus, death ensues with the greatest rapidity. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 5.-ELEPHANTIASIS. %0a%3c %0a%3c We have already 14 stated that elephantiasis 15 was unknown %0a%3c %0a%3c 3 a.u.c 590. %0a%3c %0a%3c 10 “ Carbunculus.” A malignant pustule, accompanied with swelling and %0a%3c ending with gangrene, is still known by this name, but it does not mani¬ %0a%3c fest any particular preference for the mouth and tongue. Fee says that %0a%3c carbuncle was recently (1833) endemic in Provence, the ancient’Gallia %0a%3c Narbonensis, for which reason it had received the name of “ Charbon Pro¬ %0a%3c vencal.” %0a%3c %0a%3c 11 Consul, A.u.c. 819. 12 Consul, a.u.c. 816. %0a%3c %0a%3c 13 Judging from this symptom, Dalechamps says that it looks more like %0a%3c chancre than carbuncle. u In B. xx. c. 52. %0a%3c %0a%3c 15 Supposed, as Pliny says, to have originally come from Upper Egypt. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap.

This malady, %0a%3c too, like those already mentioned, mostly makes its first ap¬ %0a%3c pearance in the face. In its primary form it bears a consider¬ %0a%3c able resemblance to a small lentil upon the nose; the skin %0a%3c gradually dries up all over the body, is marked with spots of %0a%3c various colours, and presents an unequal surface, being thick %0a%3c in one place, thin in another, indurated every here and there, %0a%3c and covered with a sort of rough scab. At a later period, the %0a%3c skin assumes a black hue, and compresses the flesh upon the %0a%3c bones, the fingers and toes becoming swollen. %0a%3c %0a%3c This disease was originally peculiar to Egypt. "Whenever it %0a%3c attacked the kings of that country, it was attended with pe¬ %0a%3c culiarly fatal effects to the people, it being the practice to %0a%3c temper their sitting-baths with human blood, for tbe treatment %0a%3c of the disease. As for Italy, however, its career was very %0a%3c soon cut short: the same was the case, too, with the disease %0a%3c known as “ gemursa” 16 to the ancients, a malady which made %0a%3c its appearance between the toes, and the very name of which is %0a%3c now buried in oblivion. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c chap. 6.—COLIC. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is a remarkable fact that some diseases should disappear %0a%3c from among us, while others, again, should continue to prevail, %0a%3c colic 17 for example. It was only in the reign of Tiberius %0a%3c Caesar that this malady made its appearance in Italy, the %0a%3c emperor himself being the first to be attacked by it; a cir¬ %0a%3c cumstance which produced considerable mystification through¬ %0a%3c out the City, when it read the edict issued by that prince %0a%3c excusing his inattention to public business, on the ground of his %0a%3c being laid up with a disease, the very name of which was till %0a%3c then unknown. To what cause are we to attribute these various %0a%3c diseases, or how is it that we have thus incurred the anger of %0a%3c the gods ? Was it deemed too little for man to be exposed to %0a%3c %0a%3c Lucretius, B. vi. 1. 1111, et seq ., attributes it to the water of the Nile. It %0a%3c is but rarely known in Europe. %0a%3c %0a%3c 16 Fee thinks that this may have been a sort of abscess similar to those %0a%3c between the fingers which are known as fourches by the French, and by %0a%3c medical men as “ Aposthema phalangum.” Gruner considers it to be a sort %0a%3c of Elephantiasis, and Triller identifies it with the disease called Gumretha %0a%3c by the Talmudists. %0a%3c %0a%3c 11 “ Colurn.” Fee takes this to be Schirrus of the colon. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c m %0a%3c %0a%3c 156 pliny’s natural history.

And then, in addition to all %0a%3c these, not less in number are the troubles and misfortunes which %0a%3c man brings upon himself! %0a%3c %0a%3c The remedies which I am here describing, are those which %0a%3c were universally employed in ancient times, Nature herself, %0a%3c so to say, making up the medicines: indeed, for a long time %0a%3c these were the only medicines employed. %0a%3c %0a%3c (2.) Hippocrates, 18 it is well known, was the first to com¬ %0a%3c pile a code of medical precepts, a thing which he did with the %0a%3c greatest perspicuity, as his treatises, we find, are replete with %0a%3c information upon the various plants. No less is the informa- %0a%3c tion which, we gain from the works of Diodes 19 of Carystus, %0a%3c second only in reputation, as well as date, to Hippocrates. %0a%3c The same, too, with reference to the works of Praxagoras, %0a%3c Chrysippus, and, at a later period, Erasistratus 20 of Cos. %0a%3c Herophilus 21 too, though himself the founder of a more refined %0a%3c system of medicine, was extremely profuse of his commenda¬ %0a%3c tions of the use of simples. At a later period, however, expe¬ %0a%3c rience, our most efficient instructor in all things, medicine in | %0a%3c particular, gradually began to be lost sight of in mere words %0a%3c and verbiage: it being found, in fact, much more agreeable %0a%3c to sit in schools, and to listen to the talk of a professor, than %0a%3c to go a simpling in the deserts, and to be searching for this %0a%3c plant or that at all the various seasons of the year. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 7. (3.)- THE NEW SYSTEM OF MEDICINE: ASCLEP1ADE3 %0a%3c %0a%3c THE PHYSICIAN. %0a%3c %0a%3c Still, however, the ancient theories remained unshaken, %0a%3c based as they were upon the still existing grounds of uni¬ %0a%3c versally acknowledged experience ; until, in the time of Pom- %0a%3c peius Magnus, Asclepiades, 22 a professor of rhetoric, who %0a%3c considered himself not sufficiently repaid by that pursuit, and %0a%3c whose readiness and sagacity rendered him better adapted for %0a%3c any other than forensic practice, suddenly turned his attention %0a%3c to the medical art.

As every one perceived %0a%3c that each of these methods of treatment lay quite within his %0a%3c own reach, all, of course, with the greatest readiness gave %0a%3c their assent, willing as they were to believe that to be true %0a%3c which was so easy of acquisition; and hence it was that he %0a%3c attracted nearly all the world about him, as though he had %0a%3c been sent among mankind on a special mission from heaven. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 8. -THE CHANGES EFFECTED BY ASCLEPIADES IN THE %0a%3c %0a%3c PliACTICE OF MEDICINE. %0a%3c %0a%3c In addition to this, he had a wonderful tact in gaining the %0a%3c full confidence of his patients : sometimes he would make them %0a%3c a promise of wine, and then seize the opportune moment for %0a%3c administering it, while on other occasions, again, he would %0a%3c prescribe cold water: indeed, as Herophilus, among the an¬ %0a%3c cients, had been the first to enquire into the primary causes of %0a%3c disease, and Cleophantus had brought into notice the treat¬ %0a%3c ment of diseases by wine, so did Asclepiades, as we learn from %0a%3c M. V arro, prefer to be indebted for his surname and repute %0a%3c to the extensive use made by him of cold water as a %0a%3c remedy, lie employed also various other soothing remedies %0a%3c for his patients; thus, for instance, it was he that introduced %0a%3c swinging beds, the motion of which might either lull the %0a%3c malady, or induce sleep, as deemed desirable. It was he, %0a%3c too, that brought baths into such general use,—a method of %0a%3c treatment that was adopted -with the greatest avidity—in %0a%3c uddition to numerous other modes of treatment of a pleasant %0a%3c and soothing nature. By these means he acquired a great %0a%3c professional reputation, and a no less extended fame; which %0a%3c %0a%3c 23 “ Gestationesexercise on horseback, in a litter, or in a carriage %0a%3c drawn by horses. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 158 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c plint’s natural iustory. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XJYI. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c was very considerably enhanced by the following incident: %0a%3c meeting the funeral procession of a person unknown to him, %0a%3c he ordered the body to be removed from the funeral pile 24 and %0a%3c carried home, and was thus the means of saving his life. This %0a%3c circumstance I am the more desirous to mention, that it may %0a%3c not be imagined that it was on slight grounds only that so %0a%3c extensive a revolution was effected in the medical art. %0a%3c %0a%3c There is, however, one thing, and one thing only, at which %0a%3c we have any ground for indignation,—the fact, that a single %0a%3c individual, and he belonging to the most frivolous nation 24 in %0a%3c the world, a man born in utter indigence, should all on a %0a%3c sudden, and that, too, for the sole purpose of increasing his %0a%3c income, give a new code of medical laws to mankind; laws, %0a%3c however, be it remembered, which have been annulled by %0a%3c numerous authorities since his day. The success of Asclepi- %0a%3c ades was considerably promoted by many of the usages of ancient %0a%3c medicine, repulsive in their nature, and attended with far too %0a%3c much anxiety : thus, for instance, it was the practice to cover %0a%3c up the patient with vast numbers of clothes, and to adopt %0a%3c every possible method of promoting the perspiration ; to order %0a%3c the body to be roasted before a fire; or else to be continually %0a%3c sending the patient on a search for sunshine, a thing hardly to %0a%3c be found in a showery climate like that of this city of ours; %0a%3c or rather, so to say, of the whole of Italy, so prolific 25 * as it is %0a%3c of fogs and rain. 26 It was to remedy these inconveniences, %0a%3c that he introduced the use of hanging baths, 27 an invention %0a%3c that was found grateful to invalids in the very highest %0a%3c degree. %0a%3c %0a%3c In addition to this, he modified the tortures which had %0a%3c hitherto attended the treatment of certain maladies; as in %0a%3c quinzv for instance, the cure of which before his time had been %0a%3c usually effected by the introduction of an instrument 28 into the %0a%3c throat. He condemned, and with good reason, the indiscrimi¬ %0a%3c nate use of emetics, which till then had been resorted to in a %0a%3c %0a%3c 21 See B. vii. c. 37. Apuleius gives the story at considerable length, in %0a%3c the Florida, B. iv. %0a%3c %0a%3c 25 Asia Minor.

(4).- REMARKS IN DISPRAISE OF THE PRACTICES OF MAGIC. %0a%3c %0a%3c But above all things, it was the follies of magic more par¬ %0a%3c ticularly that contributed so essentially to his success—follies %0a%3c which had been carried to such a pitch as to destroy all confi¬ %0a%3c dence in the remedial virtues of plants. Thus, for instance, %0a%3c it was stoutly maintained that by the agency of the plant aethi- %0a%3c opis 29 rivers and standing waters could be dried up, and that by %0a%3c the very touch 30 * * * * all bars and doors might be opened : %0a%3c that if the plant achaemenis 31 were thrown into the ranks of the %0a%3c enemy it would be certain to create a panic and put them to %0a%3c flight: that latace 32 was given by the Persian kings to their %0a%3c ambassadors, to ensure them an abundant supply of every¬ %0a%3c thing wherever they might happen to be: with numerous %0a%3c other reveries of a similar nature. Where, I should like to %0a%3c know, were all these plants, when the Cimbri and Teutones %0a%3c brought upon us the horrors of warfare with their terrific yells ? %0a%3c or when Lucullus defeated, with a few legions, so many kings %0a%3c who ruled over the Magi ? 33 Why is it too that the Roman %0a%3c generals have always made it their first care in warfare to %0a%3c make provision for the victualling of their troops ? And how %0a%3c was it that at Pharsalia the troops of Caesar were suffering from %0a%3c famine, if an abundance of everything could have been ensured %0a%3c by the fortunate possession of a single plant ? Would it not have %0a%3c been better too for Scipio JEmilianus to have opened the gates %0a%3c of Carthage by touching them with a herb, than to have taken %0a%3c so many years to batter down its bulwarks with his engines of %0a%3c war? %0a%3c %0a%3c Turning to the present moment, let them, by the agency of %0a%3c the herb menu's, 3 * dry up the Pomp tine 35 Marshes, if they can, %0a%3c %0a%3c 29 See B. xxiv. c. 102. %0a%3c %0a%3c J,J We agree with Pintianus that the name of some plant here has been %0a%3c lost, the word ‘‘condiendis ” making no sense. %0a%3c %0a%3c 31 See B. xxiv. c. 102. %0a%3c %0a%3c 32 Some plant as fictitious as the others here mentioned. %0a%3c %0a%3c 33 See B. xxx. c. i. 31 See B. xxiv. c. 102. 33 See B. iii. c. 9. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c punt’s natural history. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 1 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 160 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [nook 1XYI %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c and by these means restore so much territory to the regions of %0a%3c Italy in the neighbourhood of our city.

It really would be a mar¬ %0a%3c vellous fact that human credulity, taking its rise originally in %0a%3c the very soundest of notions, should have ultimately arrived at %0a%3c such a pitch as this, if the mind of man understood, under any %0a%3c circumstances, how to keep within the bounds of modera¬ %0a%3c tion ; and if the very system of medicine thus introduced by %0a%3c Asclepiades, had not been carried to a greater pitch of extra¬ %0a%3c vagance than the follies of magic even, an assertion which %0a%3c I shall prove on a more appropriate occasion. 31 %0a%3c %0a%3c Such, however, is the natural constitution of the human %0a%3c mind, that, be the circumstances what they may, commencing %0a%3c with what is necessary it speedily arrives at the point of %0a%3c launching out in excess. %0a%3c %0a%3c We will now resume our account of the medicinal properties %0a%3c of the plants mentioned in the preceding Book, adding to our %0a%3c description such others as the necessities of the case may seem %0a%3c to require. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c chap. 10.—lichen: five remedies. %0a%3c %0a%3c As to the treatment of lichen, so noisome a disease as it is, %0a%3c we shall here give a number of additional remedies for it, %0a%3c gathered from all quarters, although those already described %0a%3c are by no means few in number. For the cure of lichea %0a%3c plantago is used, pounded, cinquefoil also, root of albucus 1 ® in %0a%3c combination with vinegar, the young shoots of the fig-tree %0a%3c boiled in vinegar, or roots of marsh-mallow boiled down to %0a%3c one-fourth with glue and vinegar. The sores are rubbed also %0a%3c with pumice, and then fomented with root of rumex 39 bruised %0a%3c in vinegar, or with scum of viscus 40 kneaded up with lime. A %0a%3c decoction, too, of tithymalos 41 with resin is highly esteemed for %0a%3c the same purpose. %0a%3c %0a%3c But to all these remedies the plant known as “ lichen,” fro® %0a%3c %0a%3c 36 In B. xxiv. c. 102. 37 In B. xxix. c. 5. %0a%3c %0a%3c 33 See B. xxi. c. 68. 39 See B. xx. c. 85. %0a%3c %0a%3c 40 “ Flos visci.” 41 See c. 39 of this Book. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 12.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c SCROFULA. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 161 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c its efficacy as a cure, is held in preference. It is found grow¬ %0a%3c ing among rocks, and has a single broad leaf 42 near the root, %0a%3c and a single long stem, with small leaves hanging from it. %0a%3c This plant has the property also of effacing brand marks, %0a%3c being beaten up with honey for that purpose. There is another %0a%3c kind 43 of lichen also, which adheres entirely to rocks, like %0a%3c moss, and which is equally used as a topical application. The %0a%3c juice of it, dropt into wounds, or applied to abscesses, has the %0a%3c property of arresting haemorrhage: mixed with honey, it is %0a%3c curative of jaundice, the face and tongue being rubbed with %0a%3c it. Under this mode of treatment, the patient is recommended %0a%3c to wash in salt water, to anoint himself with oil of almonds, %0a%3c and to abstain from garden vegetables. For the cure of %0a%3c lichen, root of thapsia 44 is also used, bruised in honey. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 11.-QUINZY. %0a%3c %0a%3c For the treatment of quinzy, we find argemonia 48 recom¬ %0a%3c mended, in wine; a decoction of hyssop, boiled with figs, %0a%3c used as a gargle ; peucedanum , 46 with an equal proportion of %0a%3c sea-calf’s rennet; proserpinaca , 47 beaten up in the pickle of the %0a%3c mama 48 and oil, or else placed beneath the tongue; as also %0a%3c juice of cinquefoil, taken in doses of three cyathi. Used as a %0a%3c gargle, juice of cinquefoil is good for the cure of all affections %0a%3c of the fauces : verbascum , 49 too, taken in wine, is particularly %0a%3c useful for diseases of the tonsillary glands. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 12.

For the cure of all %0a%3c diseases of the fingers, hangnails in particular, cinquefoil is %0a%3c used. %0a%3c %0a%3c chap. 15.—COUGH. %0a%3c %0a%3c Of all diseases of the chest, cough is the one that is the %0a%3c most oppressive. For the cure of this malady, root of pa¬ %0a%3c naces 61 in sweet wine is used, and in cases where it is attended %0a%3c with spitting of blood, juice of henbane. Henbane, too, used as %0a%3c a fumigation, is good for cough; and the same with scordotis, 62 %0a%3c mixed with nasturtium and dry resin, beaten up with honey : %0a%3c employed by itself also, scordotis facilitates expectoration, a %0a%3c property which is equally possessed by the greater centaury, %0a%3c even where the patient is troubled with spitting of blood ; for %0a%3c which last juice of plantago is very beneficial. Betony, taken %0a%3c in doses of three oboli in water, is useful for purulent or %0a%3c bloody expectorations: root also of persolata, 6 * in doses of %0a%3c one drachma, taken with eleven pine-nuts; and juice of peu- %0a%3c cedanum. 61 %0a%3c %0a%3c For pains in the chest, acoron 65 is remarkably useful; hence %0a%3c it is that it is so much used an ingredient in antidotes. For %0a%3c cough, daucus 66 and the plant scythice 61 are much employed, %0a%3c this last being good, in fact, for all affections of the chest, %0a%3c coughs, and purulent expectorations, taken in doses of three %0a%3c oboli, with the same proportion of raisin wine. The verbas- %0a%3c cum 6g too, with a flower like gold, is similarly employed. %0a%3c %0a%3c (6.) This last-named plant is so remarkably energetic, that %0a%3c an infusion of it, administered in their drink, will relieve %0a%3c beasts of burden, not only when troubled with cough, but when %0a%3c broken-winded even—a property which I find attributed to %0a%3c gentian also. Boot of cacalia 69 chewed, or steeped in wine, is %0a%3c good for cough as well as all affections of the throat.

Wherever it is found growing wild, it is generally %0a%3c thought that there is a spring of water below, and it is looked %0a%3c upon as a sure sign that such is the case, by persons in search' 1 %0a%3c of water. The leaves are somewhat larger than those of %0a%3c ivy, and are some five or seven in number, of a whitish hue %0a%3c beneath, and a pale green on the upper surface, The plant is %0a%3c destitute of stem, blossom, and seed, and the root is very %0a%3c diminutive. Some persons are of opinion that this bechion is %0a%3c identical with the arcion, known also as the “ channeleuce.” 77 %0a%3c The smoke 73 of this plant in a dry state, inhaled by the aid %0a%3c of a reed and swallowed, is curative, they say, of chronic %0a%3c cough; it is necessary, however, at each inhalation to take a %0a%3c draught of raisin wine. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 1 7.-THE BECHION, KNOWN ALSO AS SALVIA : FOUR %0a%3c %0a%3c REMEDIES. %0a%3c %0a%3c There is another bechion 74 also, known to some persons as %0a%3c “ salvia,” 75 and bearing a strong resemblance to verbascum. %0a%3c This plant is triturated, and the juice strained off and taken %0a%3c warm for cough and for pains in the side: it is considered %0a%3c very beneficial also for the stings of scorpions and sea- %0a%3c dragons. 76 It is a good plan, too, to rub the body with this %0a%3c juice, mixed with oil, as a preservative against the stings of %0a%3c serpents.

For pains in the liver, chest, and side, if unattended %0a%3c with fever, juice of peucedanum is used. For spitting of %0a%3c blood agaric is employed, in doses of one victoriatus, 89 bruised %0a%3c and administered in five cyathi of honied wine: amomum, 90 %0a%3c too, is equally useful for that purpose.

It climbs the trunks of %0a%3c trees, and hangs down from the branches, is destitute of leaves, %0a%3c but has numerous suckers, jointed like a bulrush; the root %0a%3c is of a pale colour. This plant is given, pounded, in astringent %0a%3c red wine, for cough, asthma, and gripings in the bowels. It %0a%3c is administered also in the form of a pottage, to which some %0a%3c wine should be added.

When used, it should be taken in water, and kept %0a%3c for a considerable time in the mouth, beneath the tongue. %0a%3c Whether the part of this plant which grows above ground is %0a%3c useful or not for any purpose, is at present unknown. Plantago, %0a%3c eaten with the food, betony taken in drink, and agaric taken %0a%3c in the way prescribed for cough, are useful, all of them, for %0a%3c diseases of the kidneys. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 22. -TEIPOLIUM : THKEE remedies. %0a%3c %0a%3c Tripolium 1 is a plant found growing upon cliffs on the %0a%3c sea-shore against which the waves break, springing up, so to %0a%3c say, neither upon dry land nor in the sea. The leaves are %0a%3c like those of isatis, 2 only thicker ; the stem is a palm in height %0a%3c and divided at the extremity, and the root white, thick, and %0a%3c odoriferous, with a warm flavour; it is recommended for %0a%3c diseases of the liver, boiled with spelt.

It carries off bile, and acts strongly as a purgative %0a%3c upon the bowels; unless, indeed, aloes are added, in the propor¬ %0a%3c tion of two drachmae of aloes to two oboli of scammony. The %0a%3c drug thus called is the juice of a plant that is branchy from %0a%3c the root, and has unctuous, white, triangular, leaves, with %0a%3c a solid, moist root, of a nauseous flavour: it grows in nch %0a%3c white soils. About the period of the rising of the Dog- %0a%3c star, an excavation is made about the root, to let the juice %0a%3c collect: which done, it is dried in the sun and divided into %0a%3c tablets. The root itself, too, or the outer coat of it, is some¬ %0a%3c times dried. The scammony most esteemed is that of Colophon, %0a%3c Mysia, and Priene. In appearance it ought to be smooth and %0a%3c shiny, and as much like bull glue as possible : it should present %0a%3c a fungous surface also, covered with minute holes ; should melt %0a%3c with the greatest rapidity, have a powerful smell, and be sticky %0a%3c like gum. "When touched with the tongue, it should give out %0a%3c a white milky liquid; it ought also to be extremely light, and %0a%3c to turn white when melted. %0a%3c %0a%3c 75 It is for this reason that it is called “ reglisse,” or “ liquorice,” in %0a%3c some parts of France.

The difference may be easily %0a%3c detected, however, by the taste, as tithymalos imparts a burn¬ %0a%3c ing sensation to the tongue. To be fully efficacious, scammony %0a%3c should be two 81 years old; befpre or after that age it is useless. %0a%3c It has been prescribed to be taken by itself also, in doses of %0a%3c four oboli, with hydromel and salt: but the most advanfageous %0a%3c mode of using it is in combination with aloes, care being taken %0a%3c to drink honied wine the moment it begins to operate. The %0a%3c root, too, is boiled down in vinegar to the consistency of honey, %0a%3c and the decoction used as a liniment for leprosy. The head is %0a%3c also rubbed with this decoction, mixed with oil, for head-ache. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAr. 39.—TnE tithymalos characias. %0a%3c %0a%3c The tithymalos is called by our people the “ milk plant,” 83 %0a%3c and by some persons the “goat lettuce.” 83 They say, that if %0a%3c characters are traced upon the body with the milky juice of %0a%3c this plant, and powdered with ashes, when dry, the letters will %0a%3c be perfectly visible; an expedient which has been adopted %0a%3c before now by intriguers, for the purpose of communicating %0a%3c with their mistresses, in preference to a correspondence by %0a%3c letter. There are numerous varieties of this plant. 81 The %0a%3c first kind has the additional name of “ characias,” 85 and is %0a%3c generally looked upon as the male plant. Its branches are %0a%3c about a finger in thickness, red and full of juice, five or six in %0a%3c number, and a cubit in length. The leaves near the root are %0a%3c almost exactly those of the olive, and the extremity of the %0a%3c stem is surmounted with a tuft like that of the bulrush : it is %0a%3c found growing in rugged localities near the sea-shore. The %0a%3c seed is gathered in autumn, together with the tufts, and after %0a%3c being dried in the sun, is beaten out and put by for keeping. %0a%3c %0a%3c 80 See the following Chapters. %0a%3c %0a%3c 61 This assertion is erroneous; it has all its properties in full vigour im¬ %0a%3c mediately after extraction, and retains them for an indefinite period. %0a%3c %0a%3c 83 “llcrba lactaria.” %0a%3c %0a%3c 83 Because goats are fond of it.

Five drops are as much as each fig %0a%3c ought to receive; and the story is, that if a dropsical patient %0a%3c eats one of these figs he will have as many motions as the fig %0a%3c has received drops. While the juice is being collected, due %0a%3c care must be taken not to let it touch the eyes. From the leaves, %0a%3c pounded, a juice is also extracted, but not of so useful a %0a%3c nature as the other kind: a decoction, too, is made from the %0a%3c branches. %0a%3c %0a%3c The seed also is used, being boiled with honey and made up %0a%3c into purgative 86 pills. These seeds are sometimes inserted in %0a%3c hollow teeth with wax : the teeth are rinsed too, with a de¬ %0a%3c coction of the root in wine or oil. The juice is used externally %0a%3c for lichens, and is taken internally both as an emetic and to %0a%3c promote alvine evacuation : in other respects, it is prejudicial to %0a%3c the stomach. Taken in drink, with the addition of salt, it car¬ %0a%3c ries off pituitous humours; and in combination with saltpetre,** %0a%3c removes bile. In cases where it is desirable that it should purge %0a%3c by stool, it is taken with oxycrate, but where it is wanted %0a%3c to act as an emetic, with raisin wine or hydromel; three oboli %0a%3c being a middling dose. The best method, however, of using it, %0a%3c is to eat the prepared figs above-mentioned, just after taking %0a%3c food. In taste, it is slightly burning to the throat; indeed it %0a%3c is of so heating a nature, that, applied externally by itself, it %0a%3c raises blisters on the flesh, like those caused by the action of %0a%3c fire. Hence it is that it is sometimes employed as a cautery. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 40.— THE TITHYMALOS MYRTITES, OR CARY1TES ; TWK5TT- %0a%3c ONE REMEDIES. %0a%3c %0a%3c A second kind of tithymalos is called “ myrtites M87 by some %0a%3c persons, and “ caryites ” by others.

For calculi some persons recommend %0a%3c betony, vervain, and milfoil, in equal proportions in water, as %0a%3c a sovereign remedy. It is universally agreed that dittany is %0a%3c curative of strangury, and that the same is the case with %0a%3c cinquefoil, boiled down to one third in wine : this last plant is %0a%3c very useful, too, taken internally and applied topically, for %0a%3c rupture of the groin. %0a%3c %0a%3c The upper part of the root of xiphion 26 has a diuretic effect %0a%3c upon infants ; it is administered also in water for rupture of %0a%3c the groin, and is applied topically for diseases of the bladder. %0a%3c Juice of peucedanuni 21 is employed for hernia in infants, and %0a%3c psyllion 28 is used as an application in cases of umbilical %0a%3c hernia. The two kinds of anagallis 29 are diuretic, and a %0a%3c similar effect is produced by a decoction of root of acoron, 30 or %0a%3c the plant itself bruised and taken in drink; this last is %0a%3c good too for all affections of the bladder. ]3oth the stem and %0a%3c root of cotyledon 31 are used for the cure of calculi; and for all %0a%3c inflammations of the genitals, myrrh is mixed in equal propor¬ %0a%3c tions with the stem and seed. The more tender leaves of %0a%3c ebulum, 3 '* beaten up and taken with wine, expel calculi of the %0a%3c bladder, and an application of them is curative of diseases of %0a%3c the testes. Erigeron, 33 with powdered frankincense and sweet %0a%3c wine, is curative of inflammation of the testes; and root of %0a%3c symphytum, 34 applied topically, reduces rupture of the groin. %0a%3c The white hypocisthis 35 is curative of corroding ulcers of the %0a%3c genitals. Artemisia 36 is prescribed also in sweet wine for the %0a%3c cure of calculi and of strangury; and l-ootof nymphaea heraclia, 37 %0a%3c taken in wine, allays pains in the bladder. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 50.- CKETUMOS: EEEVEN REMEDIES.

When dried, the seed bursts asunder, and discloses %0a%3c in the interior a white kernel, known as “ cachry” to some. %0a%3c The leaf is unctuous and of a whitish colour, like that of the %0a%3c olive, only thicker and of a saltish taste. The roots are three %0a%3c or four in number, and about a finger in thickness: the plant %0a%3c grows in rocky localities, upon the sea-shore. It is eaten raw %0a%3c or else boiled w r ith cabbage, and has a pleasant, aromatic %0a%3c flavour; it is preserved also in brine. %0a%3c %0a%3c This plant is particularly useful for strangury, the leaves, %0a%3c stem, or root being taken in wine. It improves the complexion %0a%3c of the skin also, but if taken in excess is very apt to produce %0a%3c flatulency. Used in the form of a decoction it relaxes the %0a%3c bowels, has a diuretic effect, and carries off the humours from %0a%3c the kidneys. The same is the case also with alcea: 43 dried and %0a%3c powdered and taken in wine, it removes strangury, and, with %0a%3c the addition of daucus, 41 is still more efficacious: it is good %0a%3c too for the spleen, and is taken in drink as an antidote to the %0a%3c venom of serpents.

The larger of these tuberosities, or, as %0a%3c some say, the harder of the two, taken in water, is provocative %0a%3c of lust; while the smaller, or, in other words, the softer one, %0a%3c taken in goat’s milk, acts as an antaphrodisiac. Some persons %0a%3c describe this plant as having a leaf like that of the squill, %0a%3c only smoother and softer, and a prickly stem. The roots heal %0a%3c ulcerations of the mouth, and are curative of pituitous dis¬ %0a%3c charges from the chest; taken in wine they act astringently %0a%3c upon the bowels. %0a%3c %0a%3c Satyrion is also a powerful stimulant. There are two kinds %0a%3c of it: the first 6 has leaves like those of the olive, but longer, %0a%3c a stem four fingers in length, a purple flower, and a double %0a%3c root, resembling the human testes in shape. This root swells %0a%3c and increases in volume one year, and resumes its original %0a%3c size the next. The other kind is known as the “ satyrios or¬ %0a%3c chis,” 7 and is supposed to be the female plant. It is dis¬ %0a%3c tinguished from the former one by the distance between its %0a%3c joints, and its more branchy" and shrublike form. The root is %0a%3c employed in philtres: it is mostly found growing near the %0a%3c sea. Beaten up and applied with polenta, 8 or by itself, it %0a%3c heals tumours and various other affections of the generative %0a%3c organs. The root of the first kind, administered in the milk %0a%3c of a colonic 9 sheep, causes tentigo; taken in water it produces %0a%3c a contrary effect. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 63.- SATYRION : THREE MEDICINAL PROPERTIES.

It is the name, no doubt, signifying “ testicle,” which originally %0a%3c procured for it the repute of being an aphrodisiac. %0a%3c %0a%3c 6 Identified by Desfontaines with the Orchis pyramidalis, and by Fe' %0a%3c with the 0. papilionacea of Linnaeus. Littre gives the Limodorum abor- %0a%3c tivum. %0a%3c %0a%3c 7 He is probably speaking of the Crataegonon of B. xxvii. c. 40, which %0a%3c Fee identifies with the Thelygonon of c. 91 of this Book.

The %0a%3c stem, they say, is smooth and bare and a cubit iu length, and %0a%3c the root double ; the lower part, which is also the larger, pro¬ %0a%3c moting the conception of male issue, the upper or smaller part, %0a%3c that of female. %0a%3c %0a%3c They distinguish also another kind of satyrion, by the %0a%3c name of “ erythraicou :” H it has seed like that of the vitex, 12 %0a%3c only larger, smooth, and hard; the root, they say, is covered %0a%3c with a red rind, and is white within and of a sweetish taste : %0a%3c it is mostly found in mountainous districts. The root, we are %0a%3c told, if only held in the hand, acts as a powerful aphrodisiac, %0a%3c and even more so, if it is taken in rough, astringent wine. It %0a%3c is administered in drink, they say, to rams and hc-goats when %0a%3c inactive and sluggish ; and the people of Sarmatia are in the %0a%3c habit of giving it to their stallions when fatigued with cover¬ %0a%3c ing, a defect to which they give the name of “ prosedamum.” %0a%3c The effects of this plant are neutralized by the use of hydro- %0a%3c mel or lettuces. 13 %0a%3c %0a%3c The Greeks, however, give the general name of "satyrion” %0a%3c to all substances of a stimulating tendency, to the crataegis 1 * %0a%3c for example, the thelygonon, 18 and the arrenogonon, plants, %0a%3c the seed of which bears a resemblance to the testes. 16 Persons %0a%3c who carry the pith of branches of tithymalos 17 about them, %0a%3c are rendered more amorous thereby, it is said. The statements %0a%3c are really incredible, which Theophrastus, 18 in most cases an %0a%3c author of high authority, makes in relation to this subject; %0a%3c thus, for instance, he says that by the contact only of a cer- %0a%3c %0a%3c of Linnaeus has also been named ; but, though with some doubt, Fee is %0a%3c inclined to prefer the Tulipa Clusiana, or some other kind of tulip. %0a%3c %0a%3c 11 Mostly identified with the Erythroniuni dens canis of Linnaeus, the %0a%3c Log’s tooth violet. M. Fraas, however, in his Synopsis, p. ‘279, remarks %0a%3c that the E. dens canis is not to be found in Greece, and is of opinion that %0a%3c the Fritillaria Pyrenaica, the Pyrenean lily, or Fritillary, is meant.

Gout used to be an %0a%3c extremely rare disease, not in the times of our fathers and %0a%3c grandfathers only, but within my own memory even. Indeed, %0a%3c it may justly be considered a foreign complaint; for if it had %0a%3c been formerly known in Italy, it would surely have found a %0a%3c Latin name. It should, however, by no means be looked %0a%3c upon as an incurable malady; for before now, in many in¬ %0a%3c stances, it has quitted the patient all at once, and still more %0a%3c frequently, a cure has been effected by proper treatment. %0a%3c %0a%3c Lor the cure of gout, roots of panaces 20 are used, mixed with %0a%3c raisins; juice of henbane, or the seed, combined with meal; %0a%3c scordion, 21 taken in vinegar; iberis, as already mentioned; 3 %0a%3c vervain, beaten up with axle-grease ; or root of cyclaminos, 3 %0a%3c a decoction of which is good also for chilblains. %0a%3c %0a%3c As cooling applications for gout, root of xiphion 24 is used; %0a%3c seed of psyllion ; 25 hemlock, with litharge or axle-grease; %0a%3c and, at the first symptoms of red gout, or, in other words, hot %0a%3c gout, the plant aizoum. 26 For either kind of gout, erigeron, 21 %0a%3c with axle-grease, is very useful; leaves of plantago, beaten up %0a%3c with a little salt; or argemonia, 28 pounded with honey. An %0a%3c application of vervain is also remedial, and it is a good plan %0a%3c to soak the feet in a decoction of that plant in water. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 65.- LAPPAGO OR MOLLUGO : ONE REMEDY.

There are three %0a%3c kinds of it; one with a broad leaf, another with a longer leaf %0a%3c of a reddish hue, and a third with a crisped leaf, and used in %0a%3c Crete for dyeing cloths. 35 All these kinds have similar pro¬ %0a%3c perties ; and we find Nicauder prescribing them in wine as an %0a%3c antidote to the venom of serpents even. The seed also of the %0a%3c plant which we have spoken of as “ psyllion,” 36 is useful for %0a%3c the cure of gout: it is first steeped in water, and one hemina of %0a%3c the seed is then mixed with two spoonfuls of resin of Colophon, %0a%3c and one spoonful of frankincense.

Such, at all events, is the description %0a%3c given of it by our herbalists; but the Greeks speak of it as %0a%3c bearing leaves a little whiter than those of the mallow, thin %0a%3c downy stems, and branches at intervals some two palms in %0a%3c length, with small heads at their extremities, in the midst %0a%3c of the leaves, resembling the bill 55 of a crane. 56 There is also %0a%3c another 57 variety of this plant, with leaves like those of the %0a%3c anemone, but with deeper incisions, and a root rounded like %0a%3c an apple, sweet, and extremely useful and refreshing 53 for %0a%3c invalids when recovering their strength; this last would al¬ %0a%3c most seem to be the true geranion. %0a%3c %0a%3c For phthisis this plant is taken, in the proportion of one %0a%3c drachma to three cyathi of wine, twice a day; as also for %0a%3c flatulency.

The onotheras" %0a%3c too, or onear, taken in wine, has certain exhilarating pro¬ %0a%3c perties ; it has leaves like those of the almond tree, a rose- %0a%3c coloured fiower, numerous branches, and a long root, with a %0a%3c vinous smell when dried: an infusion of this root has a %0a%3c soothing effect upon wild beasts even. %0a%3c %0a%3c For fits of indigestion 67 attended with nausea, betony is %0a%3c taken in drink: used similarly after the evening meal, it faci¬ %0a%3c litates the digestion. Taken in the proportion of one drachma %0a%3c to three cyathi of oxymel, it dispels crapulence. The same is %0a%3c the case, too, with agaric, taken in warm water after eating. %0a%3c Betony is curative of paralysis, it is said; the same, too, with %0a%3c iberis, as already stated. 68 This last is good, too, for numbness %0a%3c of the limbs ; the same being the case with argemonia, w a %0a%3c plant which disperses those affections which might otherwise %0a%3c necessitate the application of the knife. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 70.- REMEDIES FOR EPILEPSY. %0a%3c %0a%3c Epilepsy is cured by the root of the panaces which we have %0a%3c spoken 70 of as the “ heraclion,” taken in drink with sea-calf’s %0a%3c rennet, the proportions being three parts of panaces and one of %0a%3c rennet.

Hippocrates 15 tells us that the appearance of jaundice %0a%3c on or after the seventh day in fevers is a fatal symptom; but %0a%3c I am acquainted with some instances in which the patients %0a%3c survived after having been reduced to this apparently hopeless %0a%3c state. We may remark also, that jaundice sometimes comes %0a%3c on without fever supervening. It is combated by taking the %0a%3c greater centaury, 16 as already mentioned, in drink ; agaric, in %0a%3c doses of three oboli in old wine; or leaves of vervain, in doses %0a%3c of three oboli, taken for four consecutive days in one hemina of %0a%3c mulled wine. But the most speedy cure of all is effected by %0a%3c using juice of cinquefoil, in doses of three cyathi, with salt %0a%3c and honey. Boot of cyclaminos 11 is also taken in drink in %0a%3c doses of three drachmae, the patient sitting in a warm room %0a%3c free from all cold and draughts, the infusion expelling the %0a%3c bile by its action as a sudorific. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 4 See B. xxv. c. 39. %0a%3c %0a%3c 6 See B. xxv. c. 66. %0a%3c %0a%3c 8 See B. xxv. c. 102. %0a%3c %0a%3c 10 See c. 37 of this Book. %0a%3c 12 See B. xxv. c. 39. %0a%3c %0a%3c 14 See B. xxv. c. 107. %0a%3c %0a%3c 16 See B. xxv. c. 3'J. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 5 See B. xxxv. c. 57. %0a%3c %0a%3c I See B. xxv. c. 101. %0a%3c 9 See B. xxv. c. 18. %0a%3c %0a%3c II See B. xxv. c. 90. %0a%3c 13 See B. xxv. c. 73. %0a%3c 13 B. iv. cc. 62, 64. %0a%3c %0a%3c 17 See B. xxv. c. 67. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 'hap. 79.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c REMEDIES FOE ABSCESSES. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 201 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Leaves of tussilago 18 are also used in water for this purpose ; %0a%3c the seed of either kind of linozostis, 19 sprinkled in the drink, or %0a%3c made into a decoction with chick-pease or wormwood : hyssop %0a%3c berries taken in water; the plant lichen,'- 0 all other vege¬ %0a%3c tables being carefully abstained from while it is being used; %0a%3c polythrix, 21 taken in wine; and struthion, 22 in honied wine. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 77. -KEMEDIES FOE BOILS. %0a%3c %0a%3c There are boils also, known as “ furunculi,” 23 which make %0a%3c their appearunce indiscriminately on all parts of the body, and %0a%3c are productive of the greatest inconvenience: sometimes %0a%3c indeed, when the constitution is exhausted, they are fatal in %0a%3c their effects.

It is strictly %0a%3c forbidden, however, to eat any food of a greasy nature the day %0a%3c before taking it. %0a%3c %0a%3c Among the Greeks there are various opinions in relation to %0a%3c this plant. According to some, who give it the same name of %0a%3c “ hippuris,” it has leaves like those of the pine tree, and of a %0a%3c swarthy hue; and, if we are to believe them, it is possessed of %0a%3c virtues of such a marvellous nature, that if touched by the %0a%3c patient only, it will arrest haemorrhage. Some authorities call it %0a%3c “hippuris,’’others, again, “ ephedron,” and others “anabasis;” %0a%3c and they tell us that it grows near trees, the trunks of which it %0a%3c ascends, and hangs down therefrom in numerous tufts of black, %0a%3c rush-like hair, much like a horse’s tail in appearance. The %0a%3c branches, we are told, are thin and articulated, and the leaves, %0a%3c few in number, small, and thin, the seed round, and similar to %0a%3c coriander in appearance, and the root ligneous: it grows, they %0a%3c say, in plantations more particularly. %0a%3c %0a%3c This plant is possessed of astringent properties. The juice %0a%3c of it, kept in the nostrils, arrests bleeding therefrom, and it %0a%3c acts astringently upon the bowels. Taken in doses of three %0a%3c cyathi, in sweet wine, it is a cure for dysentery, is an efficient %0a%3c diuretic, and is curative of cough, hardness of breathing, rup¬ %0a%3c tures, and serpiginous affections. For diseases of the intestines %0a%3c and bladder, the leaves are taken in drink; it has the property, %0a%3c also, of reducing ruptures of the groin. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Greek writers describe another 15 hippuris, also, with %0a%3c shorter tufts, softer and whiter. This last, they say, is remark¬ %0a%3c ably good for sciatica, and, applied with vinegar, for wounds, %0a%3c it having the property of stanching the blood. Bruised nyrn- %0a%3c pluea 16 is also applied to wounds. Peucedanum 17 is taken in drink %0a%3c with cypress seed, for discharges of blood at the mouth or by %0a%3c the lower passages. Sideritis 79 is possessed of such remark¬ %0a%3c able virtues, that applied to the wound of a gladiator just %0a%3c inflicted, it will stop the flow of blood; an effect which is equally %0a%3c produced by an application of charred fennel-giant, or of the %0a%3c %0a%3c 75 Identified by Littre with the Ephedra fragilis of Linnaeus.

The root of all the varieties of panaces 97 is %0a%3c used as an application for running ulcers, in warm wine. %0a%3c %0a%3c That which we have spoken of as the “ chironion” 98 is par¬ %0a%3c ticularly good as a desiccative: bruised with honey, it opens %0a%3c tumours, and is useful for serpiginoyus ulcers, the cure ofwhich %0a%3c appears more than doubtful; in which case it is amalgamate! %0a%3c with flower 99 of copper tempered with wine, either the seed, %0a%3c flower, or root, being employed for the purpose. Mixed with %0a%3c polenta 1 it is good for old wounds. The following are also %0a%3c good detergents for wounds : heraclion siderion, 2 apollinaris/ %0a%3c psyllion, 4 tragacantha, 6 and scordotis 6 mixed with honey. %0a%3c Powdered scordotis, applied by itself, consumes fleshy excres¬ %0a%3c cences on the body. Polemonia 7 is curative of the malignant %0a%3c ulcer known as “ cacoethes.” The greater centaury, 8 sprinkled %0a%3c in powder, or applied in the form of a liniment, or the leaves of %0a%3c the smaller 9 centaury, boiled or pounded, act as a detergent %0a%3c upon inveterate ulcers, and effect a cure. To recent wounds, %0a%3c the follicules of the clymenus 10 are applied. Gentian is applied %0a%3c to serpiginous ulcers, the root being bruised or else boiled down %0a%3c in water to the consistency of honey ; the juice also of the %0a%3c plant is employed. For wounds, a kind of lycium 11 is prepared %0a%3c from gentian. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 95 See B. xi. c. 39, and B. xx. c. 32 . 96 See B. xxiii. c. 13. %0a%3c %0a%3c 97 See B. xxv. c. 11, et seq. 98 See B. xxv. c. 15. %0a%3c %0a%3c 99 For a description of this substance, see B. xxxiv. c. 24. %0a%3c %0a%3c 1 See B. xviii. c. 14. 2 See B. xxv. c. 15. %0a%3c %0a%3c 3 See B. xxv. c. 17. 4 See B. xxv. c. 90. %0a%3c %0a%3c 8 See B. xiii. c. 36. 6 See B. xxv. c. 27. %0a%3c %0a%3c 7 See B. xxv. c. 28. 8 See B. xxv. c. 30. %0a%3c %0a%3c 9 See B. xxv. c. 31. 10 See B. xxv. c. 33. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 11 See B. xxiv. c. 77. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c REMEDIES FOR ULCERS. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 207 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 87.] %0a%3c %0a%3c Lysiraachia 12 is curative of recent wounds, and plantago 13 of %0a%3c all kinds of ulcerations,those on females, infants, and aged per¬ %0a%3c sons more particularly. This plant, when softened by the action %0a%3c of fire, is better still: in combination with cerate it acts as a %0a%3c detergent upon ulcers with indurated edges, and arrests the %0a%3c progress of corrosive sores: when applied bruised, it should be %0a%3c covered with its own leaves. Chelidonia 14 also acts as a %0a%3c desiccative upon suppurations, abscesses, and fistulous ulcers ; %0a%3c indeed, it is so remarkably useful for the cure of wounds, as %0a%3c to be employed as a substitute for spodium 15 even. In cases %0a%3c where the cure is almost hopeless, it is applied with axle- %0a%3c grease. Dittany, 16 taken internally, causes arrows to fall from %0a%3c the flesh ; used as a liniment, it has the effect of extracting other %0a%3c kinds of pointed weapons: the leaves are taken in the pro¬ %0a%3c portion of one obolus to one cyathus of water. Nearly equal %0a%3c in its efficacy is pseudo-dictamnon : 17 they are both of them %0a%3c useful, also, for dispersing suppurations. %0a%3c %0a%3c Aristolochia 18 cauterizes putrid sores, and, applied with honey, %0a%3c acts as a detergent upon sordid ulcers. At the same time also, %0a%3c it removes maggots, and extracts hard cores, and all foreign %0a%3c bodies adhering to the flesh, arrows more particularly, and, %0a%3c applied with resin, splintered bones. Used by itself, it fills the %0a%3c cavities made by ulcers with new flesh, and, employed with %0a%3c his, 19 in vinegar, it closes recent wounds. Vervain, or cinque¬ %0a%3c foil with salt and honey, is remedial for ulcers of long stand¬ %0a%3c ing. Roots of persolata 20 are applied to recent wounds in¬ %0a%3c flicted with iron, but for old wounds, it is the leaves that are %0a%3c employed : in both cases, in combination with axle-grease, the %0a%3c sore being then covered with the leaves of the plant. Damaso- %0a%3c niunr 1 is used for wounds the same way as for scrofula, 22 and %0a%3c leaves of verbascum 23 are employed with vinegar or wine. %0a%3c %0a%3c Vervain is useful for all kinds of callosities or putrid sores; %0a%3c root of nymphaea heraclia 24 is curative of running ulcers ; and %0a%3c %0a%3c 12 See B. xxv. c. 35. 13 See B. xxv. c. 39. %0a%3c %0a%3c 14 See B. xxv. c. 50. %0a%3c %0a%3c 15 See B. xix. c. 4, B. xxiii. c. 35, and B. xxxiv. c. 52. %0a%3c %0a%3c 16 See B. xxv. c. 53. %0a%3c %0a%3c 17 Bastard dittany.

This last root %0a%3c is useful also for the cure of steatomatous tumours, and hyssop %0a%3c for that of running ulcers ; an effect equally produced by peu- %0a%3c cedanum, 26 a plant which exercises so powerful an influence upon %0a%3c fresh wounds, as to cause exfoliation even of the bones. The two %0a%3c varieties of anagallis 27 are possessed of similar properties, and %0a%3c act as a check upon the corrosive sores known as “ nomse” and %0a%3c upon defluxions; they are useful also in cases of recent wounds, %0a%3c those of aged people in particular. Fresh leaves of raandra- %0a%3c gora, 28 applied with cerate, are curative of apostemes and %0a%3c sordid ulcers: the root too is used, with honey or oil, for wounds. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hemlock, incorporated w r ith flour of winter wheat 29 by the %0a%3c agency of wine—as also the plant aizoum 30 —is curative of her¬ %0a%3c petic eruptions, and corrosive or putrid sores. Erigeron 11 %0a%3c is employed for ulcers which breed maggots, ltoot of astra¬ %0a%3c galus 32 is used for the cure of recent wounds or of ulcers of %0a%3c long standing ; and upon these last either kind of hypocisthis 33 %0a%3c acts as a detergent. Seed of leontopodium, 34 bruised in water %0a%3c and applied with polenta, 34 extracts pointed weapons from the %0a%3c flesh : a result equally produced by using seed of pycnocomon/' %0a%3c The tithymalos characias 37 supplies its juice for the cure of gan¬ %0a%3c grenes, phagedaenic sores, and putrid ulcers; or else a decoction %0a%3c is made of the branches with polenta and oil. ltoots of or¬ %0a%3c chis 38 have a similar effect; in addition to which, applied, %0a%3c either dry or fresh gathered, with honey and vinegar, they are %0a%3c curative of the ulcer known as “ cacoethes.” Onothera 39 also, %0a%3c used by itself, is curative of ulcers when rapidly gaining head. %0a%3c %0a%3c The people of Scythia employ scythice 40 for the treatment %0a%3c of wounds.

The seed and %0a%3c leaves of verbascum, 54 boiled in wine and pounded, are used for %0a%3c the extraction of all foreign substances adhering to the body; and %0a%3c a similar use is made of leaves of mandragora 85 mixed with po¬ %0a%3c lenta, 56 and roots of cyclaminos 87 with honey. Leavesof trixago, 58 %0a%3c bruised in oil, are used for ulcers of a serpiginous nature more %0a%3c particularly, as also sea-weed bruised with honey. Betony, %0a%3c with the addition of salt, is employed for the cure of carcino¬ %0a%3c matous sores and inveterate blisters on the neck. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 89. —REMEDIES FOR WARTS, AND APPLICATIONS FOR THE %0a%3c REMOVAL OF SCARS. %0a%3c %0a%3c Argemonia 59 with vinegar, or root of batrachion, 60 removes %0a%3c warts; this last having the effect also of bringing off malformed %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 43 See B. xviii. c. 14. 44 See B. xxv. c. 17. %0a%3c %0a%3c 45 See c. 29 of this Book. %0a%3c %0a%3c 46 See B. xxii. c. 30, and B. xxv. c. 86 . 41 See B. xxv. c. 35. %0a%3c %0a%3c 4S See B. xxv. c. 37 . 49 See Note 46 above. %0a%3c %0a%3c 50 Besfontaines identifies it with the Mentha cervina, or Stag mint. %0a%3c %0a%3c 81 See B. xix. c. 50, and B. xx. c. 61. %0a%3c %0a%3c M See B. xxvii. c. 24. « s ee B. xxv. c. 19. %0a%3c %0a%3c 54 See B. xxv. c. 73. 55 gee g. xxv. c. 94 . %0a%3c %0a%3c 86 See B. xviii. c. 14. 57 See B. xxv. c. 67. %0a%3c %0a%3c 49 See B. xxiv. c. 80. 99 See B. xxv. c. 56. %0a%3c %0a%3c 60 See B. xxv. c. 109. %0a%3c %0a%3c VOL. v. p %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 210 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c flint's natural history. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XXYI. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c nails.

Seed of %0a%3c panaces, 68 mixed with wormwood, acts as an emmenagogue and %0a%3c as a sudorific: the same, too, with scordotis, 69 taken internally %0a%3c or applied topically. Betony, in doses of one drachma to %0a%3c three cyathi of wine, is taken for various affections of the %0a%3c uterus, as also directly after child-birth. Excessive menstru¬ %0a%3c ation is arrested by a pessary of achillea, 70 or else a sitting-bath %0a%3c composed of a decoction of that plant. Seed of henbane in %0a%3c wine is used as a liniment for diseases of the mamillae, %0a%3c and the root is employed in the form of a plaster for uterine %0a%3c affections; chelidonia, 71 too, is applied to the mamillae. %0a%3c %0a%3c Roots of panaces, 72 applied as a pessary, bring away the %0a%3c after-birth and the dead foetus, and the plant itself, taken in %0a%3c wine, or used as a pessary with honey, acts as a detergent %0a%3c upon the uterus. Polemonia, 73 taken in wine, brings away the %0a%3c after-birth; used as a fumigation, it is good for suffocations of %0a%3c the uterus. Juice of the smaller centaury, 74 taken in drink, or %0a%3c employed as a fomentation, acts as an emmenagogue. The root %0a%3c also of the larger centaury, similarly used, is good for pains in %0a%3c the uterus; scraped and used as a pessary, it expels the %0a%3c dead foetus. For pains of the uterus, plantago 75 is applied as %0a%3c a pessary, in wool, and for hysterical suffocations, it is taken in %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 61 See B. xxv. c. 18. %0a%3c 63 “Pterygia.” %0a%3c %0a%3c 65 See B. xxv. c. 81. %0a%3c 67 See B. xxv. c, 10. %0a%3c 69 See B. xxv. c. 27. %0a%3c 11 See B. xxv. c. 50. %0a%3c 13 See B. xxv. c. 28. %0a%3c 75 See B. xxv. c. 39. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 62 See c. 39 of this Book, et seq. %0a%3c %0a%3c 64 See B. xii. c. 37 and c. 30 of this Book. %0a%3c 66 See B. xxii. c. 71. %0a%3c %0a%3c 68 See B. xxv. c. 11, et seq. %0a%3c %0a%3c 70 See B. xxv. c. 19. %0a%3c %0a%3c 72 See B. xxv. c. 11, et seq. %0a%3c %0a%3c 74 See B. xxv. c. 31. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 90.] EEMEDIES FOE FEMALE DISEASES. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 211 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c drink. But it is dittany that is of the greatest efficacy in cases %0a%3c of this description; it acts as an emmenagogue, and is an ex- %0a%3c pellent of the foetus when dead or lying transversely in the %0a%3c uterus. In these cases the leaves of it are taken, in doses of %0a%3c one obolus, in water: indeed so active is it in its effects that %0a%3c ordinarily it is forbidden to be introduced into the chamber of %0a%3c a woman lying-in. Not only is it thus efficacious when taken %0a%3c in drink, but even when applied topically or used as a fumiga¬ %0a%3c tion. Pseudodictamnum 76 possesses pretty nearly the same vir¬ %0a%3c tues, but it acts as an emmenagogue also, boiled in doses of one %0a%3c denarius in unmixed wine. Aristolochia , 77 however, is employed %0a%3c for a greater number of purposes: in combination with myrrh %0a%3c and pepper, either taken in drink or used as a pessary, it acts %0a%3c as a powerful emmenagogue, and brings away the dead foetus %0a%3c and the after-birth. This plant, the smaller kind in particular, %0a%3c used either as a fomentation, fumigation, or pessary, acts as a %0a%3c preventive of procidence of the uterus. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hysterical suffocations and irregularities of the catamenia %0a%3c are treated with agaric, taken in doses of three oboli, in one %0a%3c cyathus of old wine : vervain is used also in similar cases, as a %0a%3c pessary, with fresh hog’s lard ; or else antirrhinum , 78 with rose %0a%3c oil and honey. Root of Thessalian nymphaea , 79 used as a %0a%3c pessary, is curative of pains in the uterus ; taken in red wine, %0a%3c it arrests uterine discharges. Root of cyclaminos , 80 on the %0a%3c other hand, taken in drink and employed as a pessary, acts as %0a%3c an emmenagogue: a decoction of it, used as a sitting-bath, %0a%3c cures affections of the bladder. Cissanthemos , 81 taken in drink, %0a%3c brings away the after-birth, and is curative of diseases of the %0a%3c uterus. The upper part of the root of xiphion , 82 taken in %0a%3c doses of one drachma, in vinegar, promotes menstruation. A %0a%3c fumigation of burnt peucedanum 83 has a soothing effect in %0a%3c cases of hysterical suffocation. Psyllion , 84 taken in the pro¬ %0a%3c portion of one drachma to three cyathi of hydromel, is par¬ %0a%3c ticularly good for promoting the lochial discharge.

This %0a%3c last plant is either used as an article of food, or is taken in %0a%3c drink: in a raw state, as already stated , 88 it has a burning %0a%3c flavour ; but when cooked, the taste of it is greatly improved by %0a%3c the addition of salt, oil, and cummin. Daucus , 89 taken in drink, %0a%3c promotes the catamenia, and is an expellent of the after-birth %0a%3c in a very high degree.

Callithrix , 6 applied as a fomentation, is curative %0a%3c of affections of the vagina: it removes scaly eruptions 7 also %0a%3c of the head, and, beaten up in oil, it stains the hair. Ge- %0a%3c ranion , 8 taken in white wine, or hypocisthis 9 in red, arrests %0a%3c all uterine discharges. Hyssop modifies hysterical suffocations. %0a%3c Loot of vervain, taken in water, is a most excellent remedy %0a%3c for all accidents incident to, or consequent upon, delivery. %0a%3c Some persons mix bruised cypress seed with peucedanum 10 in %0a%3c red wine. Seed, too, of psyllion , 11 boiled in water and taken %0a%3c warm, has a soothing effect upon all defluxions of the uterus. %0a%3c Symphjffon , 12 bruised in wine, promotes menstruation. Juice %0a%3c of scordotis , 13 in the proportion of one drachma to four cyathi %0a%3c of hydromel, accelerates delivery. Leaves of dittany are given %0a%3c for the same purpose, in water, with remarkable success.
