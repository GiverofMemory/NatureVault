csum=mach's principle [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mach%2527s_principle|#]] is that [[gravity]] is what causes inertia [[https://youtu.be/0bp8fk5rosI|#]]  it is based on spacetime sheet bending gravity theory which I believe is incorrect to begin with.  However the thought that inertia is dependint on gravity is interesting but I can't yet imagine if inertia would be effected without gravity, or with less gravity.
