And let no one, misled by %0athe apparent triviality of the names which we shall have to %0aemploy, regard this subject as one that is frivolous or con¬ %0atemptible : for we shall here have to set forth the state of peace %0aor of war which exists between the various departments of %0aNature, the hatreds or friendships which are maintained by %0aobjects dumb and destitute of sense, and all, too, created—a %0awonderful subject for our contemplation !—for the sake of man %0aalone. To these states, known to the Greeks by the respec¬ %0ative appellations "sympathia” and “ antipathia,” we are in¬ %0adebted for the first principles^ of all things ; for hence it is that %0awater has the property of extinguishing fire, that the sun %0aabsorbs water, that the moon produces it, and that each of %0athose heavenly bodies is from time to time eclipsed by the %0aother. %0a%0aHence it is, too, descending from the contemplation of a %0aloftier sphere, that the loadstone® possesses the property of at- %0a%0a^ Fee remarks, that the commencement of this exordium is contrary to %0atruth, and that Pliny appears to forget that in the Eighteenth Book he %0ahas treated, at very considerable length, of the various cereals, the art of %0apreparing bread, pottages, ptisans. &c. lie suggests, that the author may %0ahave originally intended to place the Eighteenth Hook after the present %0aone, and that on changing his plan he may have neglected to alter the pre¬ %0asent passage. From his mention, however, of man’s “ignorance by what %0ameans he exists,” it is not improbable that be may have considered that %0athe nutritive qualities of plants are really based upon their medicinal vir¬ %0atues, a point of view little regarded by the majority of mankind in his %0atime, but considered by Pliny to be the true key to a just appreciation of %0atheir utility. ^ “Q„ibus cuncta constant.” Sec B. xxiv. c. 1. %0a%0a* -See B. xxxiv. c. 42. %0a%0a%0aCliap. 2.] %0a%0a%0aTHE WILD CUCUMBER. %0a%0a%0a207 %0a%0a%0atractiiig iron, and unotlier stone,^ again, that of repelling it; %0aand that the diamond, tliat pride of luxury and opulence, %0athough infrangible by every other object, and presenting a %0aresistance that cannot be overcome, is broken asunder by a %0alie-goat’s blood ®—in addition to numerous other marvels of %0a■which we shall have to speak on more appropriate occasions, %0aequal to this or still more wonderful even. My only request is %0athat pardon may be accorded me for beginning Avith objects of %0aa more humble nature, though still so greatly conducive to our %0ahealth—I mean the garden plants, of Avhich I shall now pro¬ %0aceed to speak. %0a%0a%0aCHAP. 2. (1.)-THE AVILD CUCUMBER; TWENTY-SIX REMEDIES. %0a%0aWe haA'e already stated® that there is a wild cucumber, con¬ %0asiderably smaller than the cultivated one. From this cucum¬ %0aber the medicament known as “ elaterium” is prepared, being %0athe juice extracted from tbe seed.'' To obtain this juice the %0afruit is cut before it is ripe—indeed, if this precaution is not %0ataken at an early period, the seed is apt to spirt® out and be pro¬ %0aductive of danger to the eyes. After it is gathered, the fruit is %0akept AV’hole for a night, and on the following day an incision %0ais made in it with a reed. The seed, too, is generally sprinkled %0aAvith ashes, Avith the view of retaining in it as large a quan¬ %0atity of the juice as possible. When the juice is extracted, it %0ais received in rain Avater, where it falls to the bottom; after %0awhich it is thickened in the sun, and then divided into lozenges, %0a%0a%0a* Tlie “ theamedrs.” Sec B. xxxvi. c. 25. %0a%0a* Pliny is the only author who makes mention of this singularly absurd %0anotion. %0a%0a® In B. xix. c. 24 : so, too, Dioscorides, B. iv. c. 154. Tbe wild cu¬ %0acumber of Pliny, as Fee observes, is in reality not a cucumber, but a %0atotally different plant, the Cucumis silvestris asiuinus of C. iiauhin, the' %0aMomordica elaterium of Linmeus, or squirting cucumber. %0a%0a’’ Elaterium, Fee says, is not extracted from the seed, but is the juice %0aof the fruit itself, as Pliny, contradicting himself, elsewhere informs us. %0aTheophrastus commits the same error, which Dioscorides does not; and %0ait is not improbable that Pliny has copied from two sources the method %0aof making it. %0a%0a“ Meanino- tbe juice and seed combined, probably. Fee thinks that it %0ais to this the medicament owes its name, from tXdovw. to “ drive” or %0a“impel.” It is much more pi-obable, howeA'er, that the medicine was so %0acalled from its strong purgative powers; for, as Galen tells us, iXarj/pme %0awas a name given to purgative medicines ui general. %0a%0a%0a208 %0a%0a%0aPLINi’s NATUUAL HISTOllY. %0a%0a%0a[Oook XX. %0a%0a%0awhich are of singular utility to mankiml for healing dimness’ %0aof sight, diseases of the eyes, and ulcerations of the eyelids. %0aIt is said that if the roots of a vine are touched with this %0ajuice, the grapes of it will be sure never to be attacked by %0abirds. %0a%0aThe root,*® too, of the wild cucumber, boiled in vinegar, is %0aemployed in fomentations for the gout, and the juice of it is %0aused as a remedy for tooth-ache. Dried and mixed with resin, %0athe root is a cure for impetigo’* and the skin diseases known %0aas “ psora” ** and “ lichen *® it is good, too, for imposthuraes %0aof the parotid glands and inflammatory tumours,** and restores %0athe natural colour to the skin when a cicatrix has formed.— %0aThe juice of the leaves, mixed with vinegar, is used as an %0ainjection for the ears, in cases of deafness. %0a%0aCHAP. 3 . -ELATERIUM ; TWENTY-SEVEN REMEDIES. %0a%0aThe proper season for making elaterium is the autunm ; and %0athere is no medicament known that will keep longer than this.*® %0aIt begins to be fit for use when three years old; but if it is %0afound desirable to make use of it at an earlier period than %0athis, the acridity of the lozenges maj^ be modified by putting %0athem with vinegar upon a slow fire, in a new earthen pot. %0aThe older it is the better, and before now, as we learn from %0aTheophrastus, it has been known to keep*® so long as two hun¬ %0adred years. Even after it has been kept so long as fifty*® %0ayears, it retains its property of extinguishing a light; indeed, %0a%0a® Dioscorides, B. iv. c. 1.54, states to this effect. Fee remarks that, %0asingularly enough, most of tlie antiophthahnics used by the ancients, were %0acomposed of acrid and almost corrosive medicaments, quite in opposition to %0athe sounder notions entertained on the subject by the moderns. %0a%0aDioscorides says the same; and much the same statements are made %0aby Cclsus, Apuleius, Marcellus Empiricus, and Plinius Valerianus. The %0adifferent parts of the plant, dried, have but very feeble properties, F^esays. %0a%0a*■' A sort of tetter or ring-worm Celsus enumerates four varieties. %0a%0a*'^ Itch-scab, probably. %0a%0a*® A disease of the skin, in which the scab assumes the form almost of a %0alichen or moss. %0a%0a“Panos.” “Panus” was the name given to a wide-spreading, but %0anot deeply-seated, tumour, the surface of which presented a blistered %0aappearance. %0a%0a‘“ Fee says that this is not the fact, as it speedily deteriorates by %0akeeping. %0a%0al4om Theophrastus, llist.

B. ix. c. 10. %0a%0a%0aChap. 4.] %0a%0a%0aANGUINE OB EBUATIC CUCUMBEE. %0a%0a%0a209 %0a%0a%0ait is the proper way of testing the genuineness of the drug to %0ahold it to the flame and make it scintillate above and below, %0abefore Anally extinguishing it. The elaterium which is pale, %0asmooth, and slightly bitter, is superior to that which has a %0agrass-green appearance and is rough to the touch. %0a%0aIt is generally thought that the seed of this plant will faci¬ %0alitate conception if a woman carries it attached to her person, %0abefore it has touched the ground ; and that it has the effect of %0aaiding parturition, if it is flrst wrapped in ram’s wool, and then %0atied round the woman’s loins, without her knowing it, care %0abeing taken to carry it out of the house the instant she is %0adelivered. %0a%0aThose persons who magnify the praises of the wild cucum¬ %0aber say that the very best is that of Arabia, the next being %0athat of Arcadia, and then that of Cyrenae : it bears a resem¬ %0ablance to the heliotropium,^® they say, and the fruit, about the %0asize of a walnut, grows between the leaves and branches. The %0aseed, it is said, is very similar in appearance to the tail of %0aa scorpion thrown back,, but is of a whitish hue. Indeed, %0athere are some persons who give to this cucumber the name of %0a“ scorpionium,” and say that its seed, as well as the elaterium, %0ais remarkably efficacious as a cure for the sting of the scor¬ %0apion. As a purgative, the proper dose of either is from half %0aan obolus to an obolus, according to the strength of the pa¬ %0atient, a larger dose than this being fatal.'® It is in the same %0aproportions, too, that it is taken in drink for phthiriasis®® and %0adropsy; applied externally with honey or old olive oil, it is %0aused for the cure of quinsy and affections of the trachea. %0a%0aCHAP. 4, (2.)—THE ANGUINE OR EREATIC CUCUMBER : FIVE %0aREMEDIES. %0a%0aMany authors are of opinion that the wild cucumber is %0aidentical with the plant known among us as the “ anguine,” %0aand by some persons as the “erratic”*' cucumber. Objects %0a%0a*' Fee acknowledges the truth of this observation, that of a green colour %0acontaining feculent matter, and showing that the juice is not pure. %0a%0aIn reality there is no such resemblance whatever. See B. xxii. c. 29. %0a%0aFee says that this is an exaggerated account of the properties of the %0awild cucumber, as it would require a very considerable dose to cause death. %0a%0a“ The Morbus pedicularis, or “ lousy disease.” %0a%0aThis has been identified by some w'riters, F^e says, with the Cucumis %0aflcxuosus of Linnaeus; but, as he observes, that plant comes originally %0a%0aVOL. rv.

The same authors’* say, too, that a decoction'of it in %0avinegar, externally applied, gives instantaneous relief in cases %0aof gout and diseases of the joints. As a remedy, too, for lum¬ %0abago, the seed of it is dried in the sun and pounded, being %0agiven in doses of twenty denarii to halt a sextarius of water. %0aMixed with woman’s milk and applied as a liniment, it is a %0acure for tumours which have suddenly formed. %0a%0aElaterium promotes the menstrual discharge ; but if taken %0aby females when pregnant, it is productive of abortion. It %0ais good, also, for asthma, and, injected into the nostrils, for %0athe jaundice.*® Kubbed upon the face in the sun, it removes %0afreckles** and spots upon the skin. %0a%0aCUAP. 5..—THE CULTIVATED CUCUMBER : NINE REMEDIES. %0a%0aMany persons attribute all these properties to the cultivated %0acucumber^® as well, a plant which even without them would %0abe of very considerable importance, in a medicinal point of %0aview. A pinch of the seed, for instance, in three fingers, %0abeaten up with cummin and taken in wine, is extremely bene¬ %0aficial for a cough : for phrenitis, also, doses of it are adminis¬ %0atered in woman’s milk, and doses of one acetabulum for dysen¬ %0atery. As a remedy for purulent expectorations, it is taken %0awith an equal quantity of cummin ;*® and it is used with hy- %0adromel for diseases of the liver. Taken in sweet wine, it is a %0adiuretic; and, in combination with cummin,*® it is used as an %0ainjection for affections of the kidneys. %0a%0afrom India, and it is more than probable that it was not known by the %0aancients; in addition to which, it is possessed of no medicinal properties %0awhatever. He looks upon it as an indigenous plant not identified. %0a%0aSo Dioscorides, B. iv. c. 154. %0a%0a“ Morbus regiusliterally, the “ royal disease.” %0a%0a** “ Lentigo.” %0a%0aSee B. xix. c. 23. It is but little appreciated for its medicinal pro¬ %0aperties by the moderns. Emulsions are sometimes made of the seeds, %0awhich are of an oily nature. Fee says that the French ladies esteem %0apommade of cucumber as an excellent cosmetic; which is, however, an %0aerroneous notion. %0a%0aThe combination of cummin with cucumber seed is in opposition, %0aFee remarks, with their medicinal properties, the one being soothing, and %0athe other moderately exciting. %0a%0a%0aChap. 6.j %0a%0a%0aPBPOKEa. %0a%0a%0a211 %0a%0a%0aCHAP. 6.-PhPONES : ELEVEN EEMEDIES. %0a%0aThe fruit known as pepones” are a cool and refreshing diet, %0aand are slightly relaxing to the stomach. Applications are %0aused of the pulpy flesh in defluxions or pains of the eyes. The %0aroot, too, of this plant cures the hard ulcers known to us as %0a“ceria,” from their resemblance to a honeycomb, and it acts %0aas an emetic.*® Dried and reduced to a powder, it is given %0ain doses of four oboli in hydromel, the patient, immediately %0aafter taking it, being made to walk half a mile. This powder %0ais employed also in cosmetics*® for smoothing the skin. The %0arind, too, has the effect*® of promoting vomiting, and, when %0aapplied to the face, of clearing the skin; a result which is %0aequally produced by an external application of the leaves of all %0athe cultivated cucumbers. These leaves, mixed with honey, %0aare emploj'ed for the cure of the pustules known as “ epi- %0anyctis;”*^ steeped in wine, they are good, too, for the bites %0aof dogs and of multipedes,** insects known to the Greeks by %0athe name of “seps,”**of an elongated form, with hairy legs, %0aand noxious to cattle more particularly; the sting being fol¬ %0alowed by swelling, and the wound rapidly putrifying. %0a%0aThe smell of the cucumber itself is a restorative*^ in fainting %0afits. It is a well-known fact, that if cucumbers are peeled and %0athen boiled in oil, vinegar, and honey, they are all the more %0apleasant eating-*® for it. %0a%0a^ As to the several varieties of the pumpkin or gourd, known under %0athis name, see B. xix. c. 24. %0a%0a** Dioscorides states to the same effect, and, as Fee thinks, with a pro¬ %0abability of being correct. %0a%0a“ Smegmata.” %0a%0a“ This assertion, Ffee says, is utterly untrue. %0a%0aFrom iiri, “upon,” and vi'?, “night.” These are red or whitish %0apustules, accompanied with sharp pains, which appear on the skin at %0anight, and disappear in the day-time. Seec. 21. %0a%0aOr “many-legs.” See B. xxix. c. 39. Probably one of our mille¬ %0apedes or centipedes: though Fee suggests that it may have been a large %0acaterpillar %0a%0aFrom (TtjTrtiv. “ to rot.” %0a%0aThis, F6e says, is untrue : but it is hard to say on what grounds he %0ahimself asserts that the smell of the cucumber is faint, and almost nauseous. %0a%0aThis, probably, is not conformable to modern notions on the subject. %0a%0a%0a212 %0a%0a%0aplikt’s natural history. %0a%0a%0a[Book XX. %0a%0a%0aCHAP. 7. (3.)-THE gourd: seventeen remedies, the %0a%0a60MPHUS : ONE REMEDY. %0a%0aThere is found also a wild gourd, called “ somphos * by the %0aGreeks, empty within (to which circumstance it owes its %0aname),^® and long and thick in shape, like the finger: it grows %0anowhere except upon stony spots. The juice ot this gourd, %0awhen chewed, is very beneficial to the stomach. %0a%0aCHAP. 8.—THE COLOCTNTHIS : TEN REMEDIES. %0a%0aThere is another variety of the wild gourd, known as the %0a“ colocynthis this kind is full of seeds, but not so large as %0athe cultivated one. The pale colocynthis is better than those %0aof a grass-green colour. Employed by itself when dried, it %0aacts as a very powerfuP® purgative ; used as an injection, it is %0aa remedy for all diseases of the intestines, the kidneys, and the %0aloins, as well as for paralysis. The seed being first removed, it %0ais boiled down in hydromel to one half; after which it is used as %0aan injection, with perfect safety, in doses of four oboli. It is %0agood, too, for the stomach, taken in pills composed of the dried %0apowder and boiled honey. In jaundice seven seeds of it may %0abe taken with beneficial effects, with a draught of hydromel %0aimmediately after. %0a%0aThe pulp of this fruit, taken with wormwood and salt, is a %0aremedy for toothache, and the juice of it, warmed with vinegar, %0ahas the effect of strengthening loose teeth. Rubbed in with %0aoil, it removes pains of the spine, loins, and hips : in addition %0ato which, really a marvellous thing to speak of! the seeds of %0ait, in even numbers, attached to the body in a linen cloth, %0awill cure, it is said, the fevers to which the Greeks have %0agiven the name of “periodic.”^® The juice, too, of the cultivated %0a%0aFrom the Greek %3cjofi(p6g, porous, spongy, or hollow. %0a%0aIt is supposed by some naturalists that this gourd is the variety %0aPyxidaris of the Cucurbita pepo of Linnaeus, the Colocynthis amara of %0aC. Bauhin. Fee remarks, however, that this designation is arbitrary; as %0athis plant never grows wild in Europe, and its pulp is so bitter, that instead %0aof proving beneficial to the stomach, it would cause vomiting. From the %0afact of its comparison to the human finger, he doubts if it really was one %0aof the Cucurbitae at all. %0a%0a3® The Cucumis colocynthus of Linnaeus, or Coloquintida, so remarkable %0afor its bitterness. %0a%0aIt is an extremely drastic, and indeed violent purgative. %0a%0a^ Eecurring at stated times.

The leaves of it, bruised with fresh %0acypress-leaves, or the leaves alone, boiled in a vessel of potters’ %0aclay and beaten up with goose-grease, and then applied to the %0apart affected, are an excellent cure for wounds. Fresh shav¬ %0aings of the rind are used as a cooling application for gout, and %0aburning pains in the head, in infants more particularly ; they %0aare good, too, for erysipelas,whether it is the shavings of %0athe rind or the seeds of the plant that are applied to the part %0aaffected. The juice of the scrapings, employed as a liniment %0awith rose-oil and vinegar, moderates the burning heats of %0afevers; and the ashes of the dried fruit applied to burns are %0aefficacious in a most remarkable degree. %0a%0aChrysippus, the physician, condemned the use of the gourd %0aas a food : it is generally agreed, however, that it is extremely %0agood“ for the stomach, and for ulcerations of the intestines %0aand of the bladder. %0a%0aCHAP. 9 . —rape; nine remedies. %0a%0aKape, too, has its medicinal properties. Warmed, it is used as %0aan application for the cure of chilblains,^® in addition to which, %0ait has the effect of protecting the feet from cold. A hot decoc¬ %0ation of rape is employed for the cure of cold gout; and raw %0arape, beaten up with salt, is good for all maladies of the feet, %0allape-seed, used as a liniment, and taken in drink, with wine, %0ais said to have a salutary effect against the stings of serpents. %0a%0aThe cultivated cucumber, Fee says. %0a%0a42 Or “ aposthumes,” a kind of abscess, probably. %0a%0aIS “ Ignis sacer,” literally “ sacred fire.” It is sometimes called “ St. An¬ %0athony’s fire.” Celsus, in describing it, distinguishes it, however, from %0aerysipelas, and divides it into two kinds. %0a%0aOn tho contrary, Fde says, the pulp of the gourd is tough and lea¬ %0athery, extremely insipid, and destitute of any salutary qualities. %0a%0aA decoction of rape or turnips is still recommended for chilblains at %0athe present day.

This plant is often employed for smoothing the skin %0aof the face and the body generally, meal of fitches,^ barley, %0awheat, and lupines, being mixed with it in equal proportions. %0a%0aThe root of the wild rape is applied to no useful purpose %0awhatever. %0a%0aCHAP. 11.

It is only efficacious as a %0adiui'etic, being in other respects of a heating nature. In Italy, %0ait is known also by the name of “ armoracia.” %0a%0aCHAP. 13. —THE CULTIVATED EADISH: FOETT-THEEE EEMEDIES. %0a%0aThe cultivated radish, too, in addition to what we have %0aalready said®* of it, purges the stomach, attenuates the phlegm, %0aacts as a diuretic, and detaches the bilious secretions, A de¬ %0acoction of the rind of radishes in wine, taken in the morning %0ain doses of three cyathi, has the effect of breaking and expel¬ %0aling calculi of the bladder. A decoction, too, of this rind in %0avinegar and water, is employed as a liniment for the stings of %0aserpents. Taken fasting in the morning with honey, radishes %0aare good®* for a cough.

At the same time, he says, powerful as their %0aproperties are, we cannot believe that they exercise the destructive effects %0aon lish here stated. %0a%0a%0aChap. 26.] %0a%0a%0aHAWK-WEED. %0a%0a%0a229 %0a%0a%0aas “ caesapon.”“ The leaves of this lettuce, applied as a liniment %0awith polenta,are used for the cure of ulcerous sores.

Among these plants %0athere is one with round, short leaves, known to some per¬ %0asons as “ hieracicn;”^ from the circumstance that the hawk %0atears it open and sprinkles^® its ej^es with the juice, and so dis¬ %0apels any dimness of sight of which it is apprehensive.

Drunk in wine it is a cure for the %0astings of serpents, and the leaves and stalk of the plant are %0apounded and taken in vinegar.

We have already made %0amention,®* to some extent, of the peculiar properties of the %0acultivated lettuce, such as promoting sleep, allaying the sexual %0apassions, cooling the body when heated, purging®* the stomach, %0aand making blood. In addition to these, it possesses no few %0aproperties besides; for it has the effect of removing flatulency, %0aand of dispelling eructations, while at the same time it pro¬ %0amotes the digestion, without ever being indigestible itself. %0aIndeed, there is no article of diet known that is a greater sti¬ %0amulant to the appetite, or which tends in a greater degree to %0a%0a“ Lactucarium,” or the inspissated milky juice of the garden lettuce, %0ais still used occasionally as a substitute for opium, having slightly anodyne %0aproperties, but, as Fee remarks, all that Pliny says here of its effects is %0aerroneous. “ Adustiones“ burns,” perhaps. %0a%0aA kind of spider.

They are ex¬ %0atremely serviceable, too, to debilitated stomachs; for which %0apurpose * oboli of sour sauce“ is added to them, the sharp¬ %0aness of which is modified by the application of sweet wine, to %0amake it of the same strength as vinegar-sauce."® If, again, %0athe phlegm with wdiich the patient is troubled is extremely %0atough and viscous, wine of squills or of wormwood is em¬ %0aployed; and if there is any cough .perceptible, hyssop wine %0ais mixed as well. %0a%0aLettuces are given with wild endive for coeliac affections, %0aand for obstructions of the thoracic organs. White lettuces, too, %0aare prescribed in large quantities for melancholy and affections %0aof the bladder. Praxagoras recommends them for dysentery. %0aLettuces are good, also, for recent burns, before blisters have %0amade their appearance : in such cases they are applied with %0asalt. They arrest spreading ulcers, being applied at first with %0asaltpetre, and afterwards with Avine.

It is a diuretic, also, %0aand employed in injections is a cure for dysentery and jaun¬ %0adice. %0a%0aThis juice, used as a liniment, allays tooth-ache, and is good %0afor the stings of serpents ; but due care must be taken that it is %0aextracted from this root only.

Cato, too, has not been more sparing in its %0a])raises than the others; and it Avill be only right to examine %0athe opinions which he expresses in relation to it, if for no %0aother purpose than to learn Avhat medicines the Homan people %0amade use of for six hundred years. %0a%0aThe most ancient Greek Avriters have distinguished three"* %0aA'arieties of the cabbage ; the curly” cabbage, to which they %0a%0a” The kind known as garden endive, the Cichorium endivia of Linnaeus. %0a%0a” “ Antbologuniena.” See 15. xix. c. 41. - ” “ Crispam.” %0a%0a%0a2.36 %0a%0a%0aPLINr’s NATURAL HISTORY. %0a%0a%0a[Book XX. %0a%0a%0ahave given the name of “ selinoYcles,”’® from the resemblance %0aof its leaf to that of parslej’, beneficial to the stomach, and %0amoderately relaxing to the bowels; the " helia,” with broad %0aleaves running out from the stalk—a circumstance, owing to %0awhich some persons have given it the name of “ canlodes”— %0aof no use whatever in a medicinal point of view ; and a third, %0athe name of which is properly “crambe,” with thinner leaves, %0aof simple form, and closely packed, more bitter than the others, %0abut extremely efiicacious in medicine.” %0a%0aCato’® esteems the curly cabbage the most highly of all, %0aand next to it, the smooth cabbage with large leaves and %0aa thick stalk. He says that it is a good thing for head¬ %0aache, dimness of the sight, and dazzling’® of the eyes, the %0aspleen, stomach, and thoracic organs, taken raw in the mcjm- %0aing, in doses of two acetabula, with oxymel, coriander, rue, %0amint, and root of silphium.®® He says, too, that the virtue of %0ait is so great that the very person even who beats up this mix¬ %0ature feels himself all the stronger for it; for which reason he %0arecommends it to be taken mixed with these condiments, or, %0aat all events, dressed with a sauce compounded of them. For %0athe gout, too, and diseases of the joints, a liniment of it should %0abe used, he says, with a little rue and coriander, a sprinkling %0aof salt, and some barley meal: the verj^ water even in which %0ait has been boiled is wonderfully efficacious, according to him, %0afor the sinews and joints. For wounds, either recent or of %0along standing, as also for carcinoma,®* which is incurable by %0aany other mode of treatment, he recommends fomentations to %0abe made with warm water, and, after that, an application of %0acabbage, beaten up, to the parts affected, twice a-day. He says, %0aalso, that fistulas and sprains should be treated in a similar %0away, as well as all humours which it may be desirable to bring %0ato a head and disperse; and he states that this vegetable, %0aboiled and eaten fasting, in considerable quantities, with oil %0a%0a76 “ Parsley-like.” %0a%0a’’’’ The only use now made of the cabbage, in a medicinal point of view, %0ais the extraction from the red cabbage, which is rich in sacciiarine matter, %0aof a pectoral, and the employment of the round cabbage, in the form of %0asour-krout, as an antiscorbutic. The great majority of the statements as %0ato the virtues of the cabbage, though supported by Cato, and in a great %0ameasure by Hippocrates, are utterly fallacious. %0a%0a’* De Re Rust. 157. ’'® “ Scintillatianibus.” %0a%0aSee B. xix. c. 15.

Among various other par¬ %0aticulars, he sa)’s, that if taken in drink with black wine, it has %0athe effect of carrying off the bilious secretions ; and he recom¬ %0amends the urine of a person who has been living on a cabbage %0adiet to be preserved, as, when warmed, it is a good remedy I'or %0adiseases of the sinews. I will, however, here give the iden¬ %0atical words in which Cato expresses himself upon this point: %0a“If you wash little children with this urine,” says he, “ they %0awill never be weak and puny.” %0a%0aHe recommends, also, the warm juiee of cabbage to be in¬ %0ajected into the ears, in combination with wine, and assures ns %0athat it is a capital remedy for deafness : and he says that the %0acabbage is a cure for impetigo®^ without the formation of %0aulcers. %0a%0aCHAP. 34. -OPINIONS OF THE GREEKS RELATIVE THERETO. %0a%0aAs we have already given those of Cato, it will be as well %0ato set forth the opinions entertained by the Greek writers on %0athis subject, only in relation, however, to those points upon %0awhich he has omitted to touch. They are of opinion that %0acabbage, not thoroughly boiled, carries off the bile, and has %0athe effect of loosening the bowels ; while, on the other hand, %0aif it is boiled twice over, it will act as an astringent. They %0asay, too, that as there is a’natural®^ enmity between it and the %0avine, it combats the effects of wine; that, if eaten before drink¬ %0aing, it is sure to prevent®® drunkenness, being equally a dis- %0apellent of crapulence®® if taken after drinking: that cabbage %0ais a food ver)”^ beneficial to the eyesight, and that the juice of %0ait raw is even moi’e so, if the corners of the eyes are only %0atouched with a mixture of it with Attic honey.

Hippocrates prescribes it, twice boiled, and eaten with %0asalt, for dysentery and cceliac affections, as also for tenesmus %0aand diseases of the kidneys; he is of opinion, too, that, us %0aail aliment, it increases the quantity of the milk in women %0awho are nursing, and that it promotes the menstrual dis¬ %0acharge.®® The stalk, too, eaten raw, is efficacious in exiielling %0athe dead foetus. Apollodorus prescribes the seed or else the %0ajuice of the cabbage to be taken in cases of poisoning by fungi; %0aand Philistion recommends the juice for persons affected with %0aopisthotony, in goats’-milk, with salt and honey. %0a%0aI find, too, that persons have been cured of the gout by eating %0acabbage and drinking a decoction of that plant. This decoction %0ahas been given, also, to persons afflicted with the cardiac disease %0aand epilepsy, wdth the addition of salt; and it has been ad¬ %0aministered in -white w'ine, for affections of the spleen, for a %0aperiod of forty days. %0a%0aAccording to Philistion, the juice of the raw root should be %0agiven as a gargle to persons afflicted with icterus ®® or phrenitis, %0aand for hiccup he prescribes a mixture of it, in vinegar, Avith %0acoriander, anise, honey, and pepper. Used as a liniment, cab¬ %0abage, he says, is beneficial for inflations of the stomach ; and %0athe very Avater, even, in Avhich it has been boiled, mixed with %0abarley-meal, is a remedy for the stings of serpents®® and foul %0aulcers of long standing ; a result wdiich is equally effected by %0aa mixture of cabbage-juice Avith vinegar or fenugreek. It is %0ain this manner, too, that some persons employ it topically, for %0aaffections of the joints and for gout. Applied topically, cab¬ %0abage is a cure for epinyctis, and all kinds of spreading eruptions %0aon the body, as also for sudden®' attacks of dimness ; indeed, if %0a%0aThe contrary is in reality the case, it being a diet only suitable to %0astrong stomachs. %0a%0aDe Morb.

At the same time, too, it should not be omitted, %0athat the water in which it has been boiled,’'-'’ and which is so %0ahighly praised for many purposes, gives out a very bad smell %0awhen poured upon the ground.

After these %0apieces are thoroughly dried, they are thrown into a jar of the %0avery strongest vinegar, suspended in such a way, however, as %0anot to touch any portion of the vessel. This is done forty-eight %0adays before the summer solstice. The mouth of the jar is then %0atightly sealed with plaster; after which it is placed beneath %0asome tiles which receive the rays of the sun the w’hole day %0athrough. At the end of forty-eight days the vessel is removed, %0athe squills are taken out of it, and the vinegar poured into %0aanother jar. %0a%0aThis vinegar has the effect of sharpening the eyesight, and, %0ataken every other day, is good for pains in the stomach and %0asides: the strength of it, however, is so great, that if taken in %0atoo large a quantity, it will for some moments produce all the %0aappearance of death. Squills, too, if chewed by themselves %0aeven, are good for the gums and teeth; and taken in vinegar %0aand honey they expel tapeworm and other intestinal worms. %0aPut fresh beneath the tongue, they prevent persons afflicted %0awith dropsy from experiencing thii’st. %0a%0aSquills are cooked in various ways; either in a pot with a %0alining of clay or grease, which is put into an oven or furnace, %0aor else cut into pieces and stewed in a saucepan. They are %0adried also in a raw state, and then cut into pieces and boiled %0awith vinegar ; in which case, they are employed as a liniment %0afor the stings of serpents. Sometimes, again, they are roasted %0aand then cleaned; after which, the middle of the bulb is %0aboiled again in water. %0a%0aWhen thus boiled, they are used for dropsy, as a diuretic, %0abeing taken in doses of three oboli, with oxymel: they are %0aemployed also in a similar manner for affections of the spleen, %0aand of the stomach, when it is too weak to digest the food, %0aprovided no ulcerations have made their appearance; also for %0agripings of the bowels, jaundice, and inveterate cough, accom¬ %0apanied with asthma. A cataplasm of squill leaves, taken off %0aat the end of four days, has the effect of dispersing scrofulous %0aswellings of the neck ; and a decoction of squills in oil, applied %0aas a liniment, is a cure for dandriff and running ulcers of the %0ahead. %0a%0aSquills are boiled with honey also for the table, with the %0aview of aiding the digestion more particularly; used in this %0away, too, they act upon the inside as a purgative.

The same author states that, applied to¬ %0apically with honey, they stanch the flowing of blood; other %0awriters say, however, that in cases of bleeding at the nose, %0acoriander and meal should be employed in combination with %0athem. Theodoras prescribes bulbs in vinegar for the cure of %0alichens, and for eruptions in the head he recommends bulbs %0amixed with astringent wine, or an egg beaten up ; he treats %0adefluxions of the eyes also with bulbs, applied topically, and %0auses a similar method for the cure of ophthalmia. The red %0abulbs more particularly, will cause spots in the face to dis¬ %0aappear, if rubbed upon them with honey and nitre in the sun; %0aand applied with wine or boiled cucumber they will remove %0afreckles. Used either hy themselves, or as Damion recom¬ %0amends, in combination with honied wine, they are remarkably %0aefficacious for the cure of wounds, care being taken, however, %0anot to remove the application till the end of four days. The %0a%0a* Theocritus says that the squill effectually protects statues aud tomhs %0afrom outrages being committed upon them; and it was so custom^' to %0aplant them about the graves, that it became a proverbial saying, “ He is %0afrantic enough to pluck squills from a grave.” Theophrastus states that %0asquills were employed in certain expiatory ceremonials. %0a%0a® As to the identification of the “ bulbs,” see B. xix. c. 30.

The root is also looked upon as diuretic. %0a%0aAsparagus seed is not used in modern pharmacy, and it is very doubt¬ %0aful if it possesses any virtues at all. %0a%0aFee says that there is no truth in this assertion. %0a%0aSee B. xix. c. 42 : the Asparagus tenuifolius of Linnaeus, the wild %0aasp.iragus, or Corruda of the South of France. %0a%0aFee says that in the South of Europe there is a kind, known to bota¬ %0anists as white asparagus, with a prickly stem : he suggests that it may %0apossibly be the same as that here spoken of. %0a%0a%0a246 %0a%0a%0aflint’s natubal iiistout. %0a%0a%0a[Book XX. %0a%0a%0aoboli respectively. A decoction of asparagus juice^ is given %0aalso for the stings of serpents; and the root of it, mixed with %0athat of marathrum,^® is reckoned in the number of the most %0avaluable remedies we are acquainted with. %0a%0aIn cases of haematuria, Chrysippus recommends a mixture %0aof asparagus, parsley, and cummin seed, to be given to the %0apatient every five days, in doses of three oboli, mixed with %0atwo cyathi of wine. He says, however, that though employed %0athis way, it is a good diuretic, it is bad for dropsy, and %0aacts as an antaphrodisiac; and that it is injurious to the %0abladder, unless it is boiled first.*‘ He states also, that if the %0awater in which it is boiled is given to dogs, it will kill them %0aand that the juice of the root boiled in wine, kept in the mouth, %0ais an effectual cure for tooth-ache. %0a%0aCHAP. 44. (11.) -PAKSLET ; SEVENTEEN EEMEDIES. %0a%0aParsley*® is held in universal esteem; for we find sprigs of %0ait swimming in the draughts of milk given us to drink in %0acountry-places; and we know that as a seasoning for sauces, it %0ais looked upon with peculiar favour. Applied to the eyes with %0ahoney, which must also be fomented from time to time with a %0awarm decoction of it, it has a most marvellous efficacy in cases %0aof defluxion of those organs or of other parts of the body; as %0aalso when beaten up and applied by itself, or in combination %0awith bread or with polenta. Fish, too, when found to be in %0aan ailing state in the preserves, are greatly refreshed by %0agiving them green parsley. As to the opinions entertained %0aupon it among the learned, there is not a single production %0adug out of the earth in reference to which a greater diversity %0aexists. %0a%0a■9 Or fennel. Fee says that, till very recently, the roots of asparagus %0aand of fennel were combined in medicine, forming part of the five “ major %0aaperitive ” roots. The sirop of the five aperitive roots is still used, he says, %0ain medicine. %0a%0a91 Chrysippus and Dioscorides were of opinion, that a decoction of as¬ %0aparagus root causes sterility in women ; a false notion, which, as Fee re¬ %0amarks, prevailed very generally in Greece. %0a%0a99 This is not consistent with fact. %0a%0a_ 99 See B. xix. c. 37. Parsley, though possessed of marked properties, %0aIS but little employed in medicine. What Pliny here states respecting it, %0aFee says, is a tissue of fables : hut it is still used for the cure of sores, and %0aeven as an ophthalmic. %0a%0a%0aChap. 45.] APIASTBUM, OE MELTSSOPHTLLUM. %0a%0a%0a247 %0a%0a%0aParsley is distinguished as male and female according to %0aChrysippus, the female plant has a hard leaf and more curled %0athan the other, a thick stem, and an acrid, hot taste. Dio¬ %0anysius says, that the female is darker than the other kind, %0ahas a shorter root, and engenders small worms.“ Both of %0athese writers, however, agree in saying that neither kind of %0aparsley should be admitted into the number of our aliments; %0aindeed, they look upon it as nothing less than sacrilege to do so, %0aseeing that parsley is consecrated to the funereal feasts in honour %0aof the dead. They say, too, that it is injurious to the eye¬ %0asight, that the stalk of the female plant engenders small worms, %0afor which reason it is that those who eat of it become barren— %0amales as well as females; and that children suckled by females %0awho live on a parsley diet, are sure to be epileptic. They %0aagree, however, in stating that the male plant is not so inju¬ %0arious in its effects as the female, and that it is for this reason %0athat it is not absolutely condemned and classed among the for¬ %0abidden plants. The leaves of it, employed as a cataplasm, are %0aused for dispersing hard tumours^® in the mamillae; and when %0aboiled in water, it makes it more agreeable to drink. The %0ajuice of the root more particularly, mixed with wine, allays %0athe pains of lumbago, and, injected into the ears, it dimihishes %0ahardness of hearing. The seed of it acts as a diuretic, pro¬ %0amotes the menstrual discharge, and brings away the after¬ %0abirth. %0a%0aBruises and livid spots, if fomented with a decoction of %0aparsley.seeed, will resume their natural colour. Applied to¬ %0apically, with the white of egg, or boiled in water, and then %0adrunk, it is remedial for affections of the kidneys; and beaten %0aup in cold water it is a cure for ulcers of the mouth. The %0aseed, mixed with wine, or the root, taken with old wine, has %0athe effect of breaking calculi in the bladder. The seed, too, %0ais given in white wine, to persons afflicted with the jaundice. %0a%0aCHAP. 45. -APIASTEUM, OE MELISSOPHYLLUM. %0a%0aHyginus gave the name of “ apiastrum ” to melissophyl- %0alumbut that which grows in Sardinia is poisonous, and %0a%0aThis distinction.

ELEVEN REMEDIES. %0a%0aOREOSELINON ; TWO REMEDIES. HELIOSELINON ; ONE REMEDY. %0a%0aOlusatrum,*® usually known as hipposelinon,^® is particu- %0alarly repulsive to scorpions. The seed of it, taken in drink, %0ais a cure for gripings in the stomach and intestinal complaints, %0aand a decoction of the seed, drunk in honied wine, is curative %0ain cases of dysuria.®® The root of the plant, boiled in wine, %0aexpels calculi of the bladder, and is a cure for lumbago and %0apains in the sides. Taken in drink and applied topically, it %0ais a cure for the bite of a mad dog, and the juice of it, when %0adrunk, is w^arming for persons benumbed with cold. %0a%0aSome persons make out oreoselinon to be a fourth species %0aof parsley : it is a shrub about a palm in height, with an elon¬ %0agated seed, bearing a strong resemblance to that of cummin, %0aand efficacious for the urine and the catamenia. Heliose- %0alinon®'* is possessed of peculiar virtues against the bites of %0aspiders : and oreoselinon is used with wine for promoting the %0amenstrual discharge. %0a%0aCHAP. 47.

Some writers have added buselinon®^ to the list, %0a%0agentle, from which the bees gather honey, quite a different plant to api- %0aastrum or wild parsley. The Sardinian plant liere mentioned, is probably %0athe same as the Ranunculus, mentioned in B. xxv. c. 109, where its iden¬ %0atification will be further discussed. %0a%0aSee B. xix. c. 48.

It is possessed of certain energetic %0aproperties, more appreciated by the ancient physicians than in modern %0apharmacy. %0a%0a33 “Bock-parsley;” from this name comes our word “ parsley.” It is %0anot clearly known to what variety of parsley he refers under this name. %0a%0a3* Or “ ox-parsley.” C.

Taken in drink or ap¬ %0aplied topically, it is an excellent remedy for the stings of %0aserpents. %0a%0aCHAP. 48. -OCIMUM ; THIEIY-FIVE REMEDIES. %0a%0aChrysippus has exclaimed as strongly, too, against ocimum^® %0aas he has against parsley, declaring that it is prejudicial to the %0astomach and the free discharge of the urine, and is injurious %0ato the sight; that it produces insanity, too, and lethargy, as %0awell as diseases of the liver ; and that it is for this reason that %0agoats refuse to touch it. Hence he comes to the conclusion, %0athat the use of it ought to be avoided by man. Some persons %0ago so far as to say, that if beaten up, and then placed beneath %0aa stone, a scorpion will breed there and that if chewed, and %0athen placed in the sun, worms will breed in it. The people of %0aAfrica maintain, too, that if a person is stung by a scorpion %0athe same day on which he has eaten ocimum, his life cannot %0apossibly be saved. Even more than this, there are some who %0aassert, that if a handful of ocimum is beaten up with ten sea %0aor river crabs, all the scorpions in the vicinity will be attracted %0ato it. Diodotus, too, in his Book of Recipes, says, that %0aocimum, used as an article of food, breeds lice. %0a%0aSucceeding ages, again, have warmly defended this plant; it %0ahas been maintained, for instance, that goats do eat it, that %0athe aiind of no one who, has eaten of it is at all affected, and, %0athat mixed with wine, with the addition of a little vinegar, it is %0aa cure for the stings of land scorpions, and the venom of those %0afound in the sea. Experience has proved, too, that the smell %0aof this plant in vinegar is good for fainting fits and lethargy, %0a%0aticum or Agriopastinaca of Crete; but, as Fee remarks, it is not clear to %0awhich of the Umbelliferaj he refers under that name. %0a%0aThe Ocimum basilicum of Linnneus, according to most commentators: %0athough F6e is not of that opinion, it being originally from India, and never %0afound in a wild state. From what Varro says, De He Rust. B. i. c. 31, %0ahe thinks that it must be sought among the leguminous plants, the genus %0aHedysariim, Lathyrus, or Medicago. He remarks also, that Pliny is the %0amore to be censured for the absurdities contained in this Chapter, as the %0apreceding writers had only mentioned them to ridicule them. %0a%0aSee B. ix. c. 51. %0a%0a^ “ In Empericis.’' %0a%0a%0a250 %0a%0a%0aPLIirr’S NATURAL niBTORT. %0a%0a%0a[Book XX. %0a%0a%0aas well as inflammations; that employed as a cooling lini¬ %0ament, with rose oil, myrtle oil, or vinegar, it is good for head¬ %0aache ; and that applied topically with wine, it is beneficial for %0adefluxions of the eyes. It has been found also, that it is good %0afor the stomach ; that taken with vinegar, it dispels flatulent %0aeructations; that applioations of it arrest fluxes of the bowels ; %0athat it acts as a diuretic, and that in this way it is good for %0ajaundice and dropsy, as well as cholera and looseness of the %0abowels. %0a%0aHence it is that Philistio has prescribed it even for cceliac %0aaffections, and boiled, for dysentery. Some persons, too, %0athough contrary to the opinion of Plistonicus, have given it %0ain wine for tenesmus and spitting of blood, as also for ob¬ %0astructions of the viscera. It is employed, too, as a liniment %0afor the mamillae, and has the effect of arresting the secretion %0aof the milk. It is very good also for the ears of infants, when %0aapplied with goose-grease more particularly. The seed of it, %0abeaten up, and inhaled into the nostrils, is provocative of %0asneezing, and applied as a liniment to the head, of running %0aat the nostrils: taken in the food, too, with vinegar, it purges %0athe uterus. Mixed with copperas^* it removes warts. It acts, %0aalso, as an aphrodisiac, for Avhieh reason it is given to horses %0aand asses at the season for covering. %0a%0a(13.) Wild ocimum has exactly the same properties in every %0arespect, though in a more active degree. It is particularly %0agood, too, for the various affections produced by excessive vo¬ %0amiting, and for abscesses of the womb. The root, mixed with %0awine, is extremely efficacious for bites inflicted by wild %0abeasts. %0a%0a%0aCHAP. 49. —ROCXET : TWELVE EEMEBIES. %0a%0aThe seed of rocket^® is remedial for the venom of the scor¬ %0apion and the shrew-mouse : it repels, too, all parasitical in¬ %0asects which breed on the human body, and applied to the face, %0aas a liniment, with honey, removes^® spots upon the skin. %0aUsed with vinegar, too, it is a cure for freckles ; and mixed %0awith ox-gall it restores the livid marks left by wounds to their %0a%0a“ Atramento sutorio.’’ %0a%0aThe Brassica eruca of Linnseus. %0a%0aNone of the numerous remedies mentioned by Pliny for removing %0aspots on the skin, are at all efficacious, in Fee’s opinion. %0a%0a%0aChap. 50.] %0a%0a%0aKASTUllTIUM. %0a%0a%0a2.51 %0a%0a%0anatural colour.

So agreeable is %0aits flavour as a savouring for food, that the Greeks have given %0ait the name of “ euzomon.”^* It is generally thought that %0arocket, lightly bruised, and employed as a fomentation for the %0aeyes, will restore the sight to its original goodness, and that %0ait allays coughs in young infants.

Applied as a liniment to %0ascrofulous sores, with bean-meal, and then covered with a %0acabbage-leaf, it is a most excellent remedy. * The other kind, %0awhich is darker than the first, has the effect of carrying off %0avicious humours of the head, and sharpening the sight: taken %0ain vinegar it calms the' troubled spirits, and, drunk with wine %0aor taken in a fig, it is good for affections of the spleen ; taken %0ain honey, too, fasting daily, it is good for a cough. The seed %0aof it, taken in wine, expels all kinds of intestinal worms, and %0awith the addition of wild mint, it acts more efficaciously %0astill. It is good, too, for asthma and cough, in combina¬ %0ation with wild marjoram and sweet wine; and a decoction of %0ait in goats’ milk is used for pains in the chest.

The juice of it, he says, %0aif injected into the ears, will effect the cure of tooth-ache, and %0aemployed with goose-grease it is a remedy for porrigo and %0aulcerous sores of the head. Applied with leaven it brings %0aboils'” to a head, and makes carbuncles suppurate and break: %0aused with honey, too, it is good for cleansing phagedienic %0aulcers. Topical applications are made of it, combined with %0avinegar and polenta, in cases of sciatica aud lumbago: it is %0asimilarly employed, too, for lichens and malformed nails, %0aits qualities being naturally caustic.

Fee says, by the ladies of Naples. The Italians use %0ait also for their salads. ^ Its smell is thought to prevent infection, for which %0are^on it is still iwed, in country-places, at funerals, and is placed before %0aprisoners when tried criminally, for the prevention, it is said, of gaol fever. %0a%0a%0aChap. 61.] %0a%0a%0aHUE. %0a%0a%0a253 %0a%0a%0aboxes of Cyprian copper.

Thus do we find %0aone thing acting as the poison of another poison, for the juice %0aof hemlock is very beneficial, rubbed upon the hands and %0a[face]®® of persons employed in gathering rue. %0a%0aIn other respects, rue is one of the principal ingredients %0aemployed in antidotes, that of Galatia more particularly. %0aEvery species of rue, employed by itself, has the effect also of %0aan antidote, if the leaves are bruised and taken in wine. It %0ais good more particularly in cases of poisoning by wolfsbane®^ %0aand mistletoe, as well as by fungi, Avhether administered in the %0adrink or the food. Employed in a similar manner, it is good %0afor the stings of serpents ; so much so, in fact, that weasels,®® %0awhen about to attack them, take the precaution first of pro¬ %0atecting themselves by eating rue. Eue is good, too, for the %0ainjuries by scorpions and spiders, the stings of bees, hornets, %0aand wasps, the noxious effects produced by cantharides and %0asalamanders,®® and the bites of mad dogs. The juice is taken %0ain doses of one acetabulum, in Avine; and the leaves, beaten %0aup or else chewed, are applied topically, Avith honey and %0asalt, or boiled Avith A’inegar and pitch. It is said that people %0arubbed Avuth the juice of rue, or even having it on their per¬ %0ason, are never attacked by these noxious creatures, and that %0aserpents are driven awaj'^ by the stench of burning rue. The %0amost efficacious, however, of all, is the root of wild rue, taken %0awith wine; this too, it is said, is more beneficial stiU, if %0adrunk in the open air. %0a%0aPythagoras has distinguished this plant also into male and %0a%0a®* It is not the rue that has this effect, so much as the salts of copper %0awhich are formed. %0a%0aFee thinks it not likely that the rue grown here was at all superior %0ato that of other localities. %0a%0aThis word, omitted in the text, is supplied from Dioscorides. %0a%0aOr aconite. There is no truth whatever in these assertions, that rue %0alias the effect of neutralizing the effects of hemlock, henbane, or poisonous %0afungi.

Many persons %0ahave dispersed films on the eyes by rubbing them with a mix¬ %0ature of the juice of rue with Attic honey, or the milk of a %0awoman just delivered of a male child : the same result has %0abeen produced also by touching the corners of the eyes with %0athe pure juice of the plant. Applied topically, mu th polenta, %0arue carries off defluxions of the eyes; and, taken with M ine, %0aor applied topically Muth vinegar and rose oil, it is a cure for %0ahead-ache. If, hoM^ever, the pain attacks the M'hole of the %0ahead,®’ the rue should be applied with barley-meal and vin¬ %0aegar. This plant has the effect also of dispelling crudities, %0aflatulency, and inveterate pains of the stomach; it opens the %0auterus, too, and restores it Avhen displaced; for M'hich purpose %0ait is applied as a liniment, Muth honej^ to the whole of the %0aabdomen and chest. Mixed with figs, and boiled down to %0aone half, it is administered in wine for dropsy ; and it is taken %0ain a similar manner for pains of the chest, sides, and loins, as %0aweU as for coughs, asthma, and affections of the lungs, liver, and %0akidneys, and for shivering flts. Persons about to indulge in %0awine, take a decoction of the leaves, to prevent head-ache and %0asurfeit. Taken in food, too, it is wholesome, whether eaten %0araw or boiled, or used as a confection ; boiled with h3^ssop, %0aand taken with wine, it is good for gripings of the stomach. %0aEmployed in the same way, it arrests internal haemorrhage, %0aand, applied to the nostrils, bleeding at the nose : it is beneficial %0aalso to the teeth if rinsed with it. In cases of ear-ache, this %0ajuice is injected into the ears, care being taken to moderate %0athe dose, as already stated, if wild rue is employed.

The same author, also, recommends %0aapplications of it, as well as fumigations, for affections of the %0auterus. %0a%0aFor cardiac diseases, Diodes prescribes applications of rue, %0ain combination with vinegar, honey, and barley-meal : and %0afor the iliac passion, he says that it should be mixed with %0ameal, boiled in oil, and spread upon the wool of a sheep’s %0afleece. Many persons recommend, for purulent expectorations, %0atwo drachmae of dried rue to one and a half of sulphur; and, %0afor spitting of blood, a decoction of three sprigs in wine. It is %0agiven also in dysentery, with cheese, the rue being first beaten %0aup in wine; and it has been prescribed, pounded with bitumen, %0aas a potion for habitual shortness of breath. For persons suf¬ %0afering from violent falls, three ounces of the seed is recom¬ %0amended. A pound of oil, in which rue leaves have been %0aboiled, added to one sextarius of wine, forms a liniment for %0aparts of the body which are frost-bitten. If rue really is a %0adiuretic, as Hippocrates®® thinks, it is a singular thing that %0asome persons should give it, as being an anti-diuretic, for the %0asuppression of incontinence of urine. %0a%0aApplied topically, with honey and alum, it cures itch-scabs, %0aand leprous sores; and, in combination with nightshade and %0ahogs’-lard, or beef-suet, it is good for morphew, wmrts, scrofula, %0aand maladies of a similar nature.

It is administered also for this purpose in %0awater or honied wine. It is generally thought, too, that it is %0ain consequence of this property that it impedes generation, by %0apreventing the seminal fluids from obtaining the requisite con¬ %0asistency. In males as well as females it arrests bleeding, and %0ait has the property, with the latter, of suspending the men¬ %0astrual discharge. Taken in water, with amylum,’^ it prevents %0alooseness in cceliac complaints. Syriatioii employed this plant %0afor the cure of abscesses of the uterus, and, in doses of %0athree oboli, with honied wine, for diseases of the liver: he %0aprescribed it also, in pottage, for spitting of blood. It is an %0aadmirable remedy for ulcerations of the head in children, and %0ahas the effect equally of drying the trachea when too moist, %0aand of bracing it when too dry. Taken in honied wine and %0awater, it carries off purulent phlegm. %0a%0aThe juice of mint is good for the voice when a person is %0aabout to engage in a contest of eloquence, but only when taken %0ajust before. It is employed also with milk as a gargle for %0aswelling of the uvula, with the addition of rue and coriander. %0aWith alum, too, it is good for the tonsils of the throat, and, %0amixed with honey, for roughness of the tongue. Employed %0aby itself, it is a remedy for internal convulsions and affections %0aof the lungs. Taken with pomegranate juice, as Democrites %0atells us, it arrests hiccup and vomiting. The juice of mint %0afresh gathered, inhaled, is a remedy for affections of the nos¬ %0atrils. Beaten up and taken in vinegar, mint is a cure for %0acholera, and for internal fluxes of blood : applied externally, %0awith polenta, it is remedial for the iliac passion and tension of %0athe mamillae. It is applied, too, as a liniment to the temples %0afor head-ache ; and it is taken internally, as an antidote for %0athe stings of scolopendrse, sea-scorpions, and serpents. As a %0aliniment it is applied also for defluxions of the eyes, and all %0aeruptions of the head, as well as maladies of the rectum. %0a%0aMint is an effectual preventive, too, of chafing of the skin, %0aeven if held in the hand only. In combination with honied %0awine, it is employed as an injection for the ears.

WILD CUMMIN : %0a%0aTWENTY-SIX REMEDIES. %0a%0aWild cummin is a remarkably slender plant, consisting of %0afour or five leaves indented like a saw ; like the cultivated %0akind, it is much employed in medicine, among the stomachic %0aremedies more particularly. Bruised and taken with bread, %0aor else drunk in wine and water, it dispels phlegm and flatu¬ %0alency, as well as gripings of the bowels and pains in the intes¬ %0atines. Both varieties have the effect, however, of producing %0apaleness®^ in those who drink these mixtures; at all events, it %0ais generally stated that the disciples of Porcius Latro,®* so cele¬ %0abrated among the professors of eloquence, used to employ this %0adrink for the purpose of imitating the paleness which had been %0acontracted by their master, through the intensity of his studies: %0aand that Julius Vindex,®^ in more recent times, that assertor %0aof our liberties against Nero, adopted this method of playing %0aupon those who were looking out for a place in his will. %0aApplied in the form of lozenges, or fresh with vinegar, cummin %0ahas the effect of arresting bleeding at the nose, and used by %0a%0aCummin is the Cuminum cyminum of Linnaeus. The seed only is %0aused, and that but rarely, for medicinal purposes, being a strong excitant %0aand a carminative. In Germany, and Turkey, and other parts of the East, %0acummin-soed is esteemed as a condiment. %0a%0aHorace, B. i.

In %0acases of jaundice, it is administered in white wine, immediately %0aafter taking the bath. %0a%0a(15.) The cummin of Ethiopia,®® more particularly, is given %0ain vinegar and water, or else as an electuary with honey. It %0ais thought, too, that the cummin of Africa hjts the peculiar %0aproperty of arresting incontinence of urine. The cultivated %0aplant is given, parched and beaten up in vinegar, for affections %0aof the liver, as also for vertigo. Beaten up in sweet wine, it %0ais taken in cases, also, where the urine is too acrid; and for %0aaffections of the uterus, it is administered in wine, the leaves %0aof it being employed topically as well, in layers of wool. %0aParched and beaten up with honey, it is used as an application %0afor swellings of the testes, or else with rose oil and wax. %0a%0aFor all the purposes above-mentioned, wild cummin is more %0aefficacious than cultivated; as also, in combination with oil, %0afor the stings of serpents, scorpions,-and scolopendrae. A pinch %0aof it with three fingers, taken in wine, has the effect of arrest¬ %0aing vomiting and nausea; it is used, too, both as a drink and %0aa liniment for the colic, or else it is applied hot, in dossils of %0alint,®’ to the part affected, bandages being employed to keep it %0ain its place.

Dioscorides, B. iii. c. 79, says that the cummin %0aof jEthiopia (by Hippocrates called “royal cummin”) has a sweeter %0asmell than the other kinds. %0a%0aFee is inclim^d to identify wild cummin, from the description of it %0agiven by Dioscorides, with the Delphinium consolida of Linnaeus; but at %0ame same time, he says, it is impossible to speak positively on the subject. %0a%0a>7 *• Punicillis.’’ %0a%0a%0a264 %0a%0a%0aplikt’s natueax histoey. %0a%0a%0a[Book XX. %0a%0a%0ablance to cummin, known to the Greeks as “ ammisome %0apersons are of opinion, that it is the same as the -iSlthiopian %0acummin.

Many persons, however, consider it %0ato be of a totally different nature from cummin, as it is so very %0amuch thinner, and of a much Avhiter colour. Still, it is em¬ %0aployed for just the same piirposes as cummin, for we find it %0aused at Alexandria for putting under loaves of bread, and form¬ %0aing an ingredient in various sauces. It has the effect of dispel¬ %0aling flatulency and gripings of the bowels, and of promoting %0athe secretion of the urine and the menstrual discharge. It is %0aemployed, also, for the cure of bruises, and to assuage defluxions %0aof the eyes. Taken in wine with linseed, in doses of two %0adrachmae, it is a cure for the stings of scorpions; and, used %0awith an equal proportion of myrrh, it is particularly good for %0athe bite of the cerastes.* %0a%0aLike cummin, too, it imparts paleness of complexion to those %0awho drink of it. Used as a fumigation, with raisins or with %0aresin, it acts as a purgative upon the uterus.

The Heracleotic %0aoriganum, however, known by the name of “ onitis,” is the %0aone that is the most esteemed for taking in drink. %0a%0aOriganum, in general, is employed for repelling serpents; %0aand it is given boiled to persons sutfering from wounds. Taken %0ain drink, it is diuretic; and mixed with root of panax, it is %0agiven for the cure of ruptures and convulsions. In combina¬ %0ation with figs or hyssop, it is prescribed for dropsical patients %0ain doses of one acetabulum, being reduced by boiling to one %0asixth. It is good also for the itch,*® prurigo, and-leprosy, %0ataken just before the bath.

This plant is employed in seasonings to sup¬ %0aply the place of lovage; and the perfume of it, when burnt %0aand inhaled, alleviates headache. Evenor prescribes an appli¬ %0acation of the root, pounded, for defluxions of the eyes; and %0alollas employs it in a similar manner, in combination with %0asaffron and wine, or else beaten up by itself and mixed with %0apolenta, for violent defluxions and the extraction of such ob¬ %0ajects as have got into the eyes : applied, too, as a liniment in %0awater, it arrests cancer of the nose. Mixed with hyssop and %0aoxymel, and employed as a gargle, it is a cure for quinsy; %0aand, in combination with rose oil, it is used as an injection for %0athe ears. Parched anise purges off phlegm from the chest, and, %0aif taken with honey, it is better still. %0a%0aEor a cough, beat up fifty bitter almonds, shelled, in honey, %0awith one acetabulum of anise. Another very easy remedy, %0atoo, is to mix three drachmae of anise with two of poppies and %0asome honey, apiece the size of a bean being taken three times %0aa-day. Its main excellence, however, is as a carminative; %0ahence it is that it is so good for flatulency of the stomach, %0agriping pains of the intestines, and coeliac affections. A de¬ %0acoction of it, smelt at and drunk, arrests hiccup, and a decoc¬ %0ation of the leaves removes indigestion. A decoction of it with %0aparsley, if applied to the nostrils, will arrest sneezing.

Dalion, the herbalist, employed it, %0awith parsley, as a cataplasm for women in labour, as also for %0apains of the uterus; and, for women in labour, he pre¬ %0ascribes a decoction of anise and dill to be taken in drink. It %0ais used as a liniment also in cases of phrenitis, or else applied %0afresh gathered and mixed with polenta; in which form it is %0aused also for infants attacked with epilepsy^® or convulsions. %0aPythagoras,.indeed, assures us that persons, so long as they %0ahold this plant in the hand, will never be attacked with epi¬ %0alepsy, for which reason, as much of it as possible should be %0aplanted near the house; he says, too, that women who inhale %0athe odour of it have a more easy delivery, it being his advice %0aalso, that, immediately after they are delivered, it should be %0agiven them to drink, with a sprinkling of polenta. %0a%0aSosimenes employed this plant, in combination with vinegar, %0afor aU kinds of indurations, and for lassitude he prescribes a %0adecoction of it in oil, with the addition of nitre. The same %0awriter pledges his word to all wayfarers, that, if they take %0aaniseed in their drink, they will be comparatively exempt %0afrom fatigue^’ on their journey. Heraclides prescribes a pinch %0aof aniseed with three fingers, for infiations of the stomach, to %0abe taken with two oboli of castoreum in honied wine; and he %0arecommends a similar preparation for inflations of the abdomen %0aand intestines.

Ihis juice, like that %0aof any other plant, is received in wool or else, if it is in %0avery minute quantities, it is scraped off with the thumb nail %0ajust as it is from the lettuce, and so again on the following %0aday, with the portion that has since dried there. If obtained %0afrom the peppy in sufficiently large quantities, this juice %0athickens, after which it is kneaded out into lozenges, and dried %0ain the shade. This juice is possessed not only of certain sopo¬ %0arific qualities, but, if taken in too large quantities, is productive %0aof sleep unto death even : the name given to it is “ opium.”“ %0aIt was in this way, we learn, that the father of P. Licinius %0aCcscina, a man of Praetorian rank, put an end to his life at %0aEavilum®* in Spain, an incurable malady having rendered %0aexistence quite intolerable to him. Many other persons, too, %0ahave ended their lives in a similar way. It is for this reason %0athat opium has been so strongly exclaimed against by Dia- %0agoras and Erasistratus; for they have altogether condemned %0ait as a deadly poison, forbidding it to be used for infusions %0aeven, as being injurious to the sight. Andreas says, in addi¬ %0ation to this, that the only reason why it does not cause instan¬ %0ataneous blindness, is the fact that they adulterate it at Alex¬ %0aandria. In later times, however, the use of it has not been %0adisapproved of—witness the celebrated preparation known as %0a“ diacodion.”®* Lozenges are also made of ground poppy¬ %0aseed, which are taken in milk as a soporific.®® The seed is %0aemployed, too, with rose-oil for head-ache ; and, in combination %0awith that oil, is injected into the ears for ear-ache. Mixed %0awith woman’s milk, this seed is used as a liniment for %0agout: the leaves, too, are employed in a similar manner. %0aTaken in vinegar, the seed is prescribed as a cure for erysipelas %0aand wounds. %0a%0aFor my own part, however, I do not approve of opium %0a%0aThis plan, Fee thinks, would not be attended with advantage. %0a%0aA name, probably, of Eastern origin, and now universally employed. %0a%0a®' “ Bilbilis” bas been suggested. %0a%0a_ Syrop of white poppies was, till recently, known as sirop of diaco- %0adium. Opium is now universally regarded as one of the most important %0aingredients of the Materia Medica. %0a%0aPoppy-seed, in reality, is not possessed of any soporific qualities what¬ %0aever. This discovery, however, was only made in the latter part of the %0alast century, by the French chemist, Kosier. %0a%0a%0aChap. 76.] THE WHITE AND BLACK POPPY. 2/7 %0a%0aentering into the composition of eye-salves,“ and still less of %0athe preparations from it known as febrifuges,*® digestives, and %0acoeliacs: the black poppy, however, is very generally pre¬ %0ascribed, in wine, for coeliac affections. All the cultivated®* %0apoppies are larger than the others, and the form of the head %0ais round. In the wild poppy the head is elongated and small, %0abut it is possessed of more active®'' properties than the others in %0aevery respect. This liead is often boiled, and the decoction ot %0ait taken to promote sleep, the face being fomented also with %0athe water. The best poppies are grown in dry localities, and %0awhere it seldom rains. %0a%0aWhen the heads and leaves of the poppy are boiled together, %0athe name given to the decoction is “ meconium ;”** it is much %0aless powerful, however, in its effects than opium. %0a%0aThe principal test*® of the purity of opium is the smell, %0awhich, when genuine, is so penetrating as to he quite insup¬ %0aportable. The next best test is that obtained by lighting it at %0aa lamp ; upon which it ought to burn with a clear, brilliant %0aflame, and to give out a strong odour Avhen extinguished; a %0athing that never happens when opium has been drugged, for, %0ain such case, it lights with the greatest difficulty, and the %0aflame repeatedly goes out. There is another way of testing %0aits genuineness, by water ; for, if it is pure, it will float like a %0athin cloud upon the surface, but, if adulterated, it will unite in %0athe form of blisters on the water. But the most surprising %0athing of all is the fact, that the sun’s heat in summer furnishes %0aa test; for, if the drug is pure, it will sweat and gradually %0amelt, till it has all the appearance of the juice when fresh %0agathered. %0a%0aMnesides is of opinion that the best way of preserving %0aopium is to mix henbane seed with it; others, again, recom¬ %0amend that it should be kept with beans. %0a%0a®‘ “ Colljriis.” %0a%0a®® “ Lexipyretos,” “pepticas,” and “ coeliacas”—Greek appellations. %0a%0a®« The type of the cultivated poppy is the Papaver somniferum of %0aLinnseiis. %0a%0a*’ This, Fee says, is a matter of doubt. %0a%0a** From fir)Kwv, a “ poppy.” Tournefort has described this kind of %0aopium obtained by decoction ; it is held in little esteem. %0a%0aFee remarks, that this account of the tests of opium is correct in the %0aextreme. %0a%0a%0a278 %0a%0a%0aFlint’s natueal history. %0a%0a%0a[Book XX. %0a%0a%0aCHAP. 77 .

The leaves of this plant %0aare smaller and thinner than those of the other wild poppies, %0aand the seed, which is very diminutive, is ripe at harvest. %0aTaken with honied wine, in doses of half an acetabulum, the %0aseed acts as a purgative. The leaves, beaten up in oil, are a %0acure for the white™ specks which form on the eyes of beasts %0aof burden. The root, boiled down to one half, in doses of one %0aacetabulum to two sextarii of water, is prescribed for maladies %0aof the loins and liver, and the leaves, employed with honey, %0aare a cure for carbuncles. %0a%0aSome persons give this kind of poppy the name of “ glau- %0acion,” and others of “ paralium,”™ for it grows, in fact, in %0aspots exposed to exhalations from the sea, or else in soils of a %0anitrous nature. %0a%0aCHAP. 79 , -THE WILD POPPY CALLED HERACLIUM, OR APHRON : %0a%0aFOUR REMEDIES.

More recently, %0athere have been added to the mixture, six drachmae of saffron, %0ahypocisthis,®^ frankincense, and gum acacia, with one sextarius %0aof raisin wine of Crete. All this, however, is only so much %0aostentation; for the virtue of this simple and ancient prepara¬ %0ation depends solely upon the poppy and the honey. %0a%0aCHAP. 80.— THE POPPY CALLED TITHTMALON, OB PAEALION : THREE %0a* REMEDIES. %0a%0aThere is a thnd kind, again, called “ tithymalon ;”®* some %0a%0amilky juice found in the stalk and leaves have caused it to be classed %0aamong the poppies, as other varieties of Euphorbiaceae appear to have %0abeen, among the wild lettuces. %0a%0aTheophrastus, Hist. Plant. B. ix. c. .31, compares this plant with the %0aStruthium — (see B. xix. c. 18). Pliny, or bis scribes, have supposed him %0at(j be speaking of the arpovOos, or “ sparrow”—hence the present mistake. %0aThe Struthium itself has received that name from the resemblance which %0aits flower bears to a bird with the wings expanded. %0a%0a” Hence its name, “aphron.” %0a%0aSee B. xix. c. 4. Pliny bas here mistaken a passage of Theophrastus, %0aHist. Plant. B. ix. c. 31 ; where he attributes this quality to the Struthium, %0aand not the Heraclium. %0a%0a” See c. 76 of this Book. It is diflScult to conjecture how one of the %0aEuphorbiaceae, a powerful drastic, could enter into the composition of a %0asoothing preparation, such as the diacodion is said to have been. %0a%0a“ Capitibus.” As Fee remarks, the capsules of Euphorbia bear no %0aresemblance whatever to the heads of the poppy.

It neutralizes the effects, %0ait is said, of poisoned arrows, and the venom of the serpents %0aknown as haemorrhois and prestertaken with the food and %0aapplied to the wound, it extracts the poison. The juice, too, %0athey say, taken in raisin wine, is an antidote for henbane. %0aWhen the plant itself cannot be procured, the seed of it is %0afound to be equally efficacious. It is a corrective, also, of im¬ %0apurities in water ; and beaten up in wine and applied topically, %0ait is a cure for head-ache and ulcers of the head. Chewed in %0acombination with honey, it is curative of other kinds of sores. %0aIt is similarly applied to the region of the brain in infants, and %0ain cases of umbilical hernia; as also for defluxions of the eyes, %0ain persons of all ages, being applied to the forehead and'tem- %0aples with polenta.

In conjunc¬ %0ation with oil, it is applied, Avith polenta, to assuage the pain %0aof wounds, and it softens indurations of the sinews. Metro- %0adorus, who wrote an Abridgment of Botany,®* says that it should %0abe given after delivery, to accelerate the lochial discharge.

Tlie wild ® mallow, %0aagain, with large leaves and white roots, is called “ althsea,” %0aand by some persons, on account of its salutary properties, %0a“ plistolochia.”^ Every soil in which mallows are sown, is %0arendered all the richer thereby. This plant is possessed ot re¬ %0amarkable virtues,® as a cure for all kinds ot stings.* those of %0ascoqnons, wasps, and similar insects, as well as the bite of the %0ashrew-mouse, more particularly; nay, what is even more than %0athis, if a person has been rubbed with oil in which any one of %0athe mallows has been beaten up, or even if he carries them on %0ahis person, he will never be stung. A leaf of mallow put upon %0aa scorpion, will strike it with torpor. %0a%0aThe mallow is an antidote, also, against the poisonous effects %0aof white ’ lead; and applied raw with saltpetre, it extracts %0aall kinds of pointed bodies from the flesh. A decoction of it %0awith the root, taken in drink, neutralizes the poison of the %0asea-hare,® provided, as some say, it is brought off the stomach %0aby vomiting. %0a%0aOther marvels are also related in connection with the mallow, %0abut the most surprising thing of all is, that if a person takes %0ahalf a cyathus of the juice of any one of them daily, he will be %0a%0aThe Malva silvestris of Linnaeus, or wild mallow. %0a%0a* The Malva rotundifolia of Linnaeus, or round-leaved mallow. %0a%0a* From fiaXaaao}, to “soften,” or “relax.” %0a%0a® These wild varieties are the same in every respeet as the cultivated %0akinds; their essential charaeteristics not being clianged by cultivation. %0aSee further as to the Althaea or marsh mallow, at the latter end of this %0aChapter. %0a%0a* The meaning of this name appears to be unknown. “ Pistolochia” is %0aa not uneommon reading. %0a%0a* Mallows were commonly used as a vegetable by the ancients; and are %0aso in China and the south of France, at the present day.

With the root of the mallow which has a single stem,“ %0ait is a good plan to prick the parts about a tooth when it aches, %0auntil the pain has ceased. With the addition of human saliva, %0athe mallow cleanses scrofulous sores, imposthumes of the parotid %0aglands, and inflammatory tumours, without producing a wound. %0aThe seed of it, taken in red wine, disperses phlegm and relieves %0anausea ; and the root, attached to the person with black wool, %0ais a remedy for affections of the mamillae. Boiled in milk, and %0ataken as a pottage, it cures a cough within five days. %0a%0aScxtius Niger says that mallows are prejudicial to the sto¬ %0amach, and Olympias, the Theban authoress, asserts that, em¬ %0aployed with goose-grease, they are productive of abortion. %0aSome persons are of opinion, that a good handful of the leaves, %0ataken in oil and wine, promotes the menstrual discharge. At %0aall events, it is a well-known fact, that if the leaves are strewed %0abeneath a woman in labour, the delivery will be accelerated; %0abut they must be taken away immediately after the birth, or %0aprolapsus of the uterus will be the consequence.

It is good, too, for gripings of the bowels %0aand affections of the bladder: applied with honey to the %0a%0aThe blitum capitatum of Linnaeus. %0a%0a“ Hence, too, the Latin word “ bliteus,” meaning “insipid,” “sense¬ %0aless,” or *■ worthless.” %0a%0aThis is not the case, it being as innocuous as it is insipid. Applied %0atopically, the leaves are emollient. %0a%0aThere is no foundation. Fee says, for this opinion. %0a%0a«« The Althusa meum of Linnaeus; our Spignel, or Baldmoney, the %0aAthamanta Matthioli of Wulf. By some authorities it is called Feni- %0aculum Alpinum perenne.

Fennel-juice is gathered when %0athe stem is swelling with the bud ; after which it is dried in %0athe sun and applied as an ointment with honey. This plant %0ais to be found in all parts of the world. The most esteemed %0apreparation from it, is that made in Iberia, from the tear-like %0adrops which exude” from the stalk and the seed fresh-ga¬ %0athered. The juice is extracted, also, from incisions made in %0athe root at the first germination of the plant. %0a%0aCHAP. 96. -HIPPOMARATHBON, OR MYRSINEXJM : FITE REMEDIES. %0a%0aThere is, also, a wild” variety of fennel, known by some %0apersons as “ hippomarathron,” and by others as “myrsineum;” %0ait has a larger leaf and a more acrid taste than the other kind. %0aIt is taller, also, about the thickness of a walking-stick, and %0ahas a white root: it grows in warm, but stony localities. %0aDiodes speaks, too, of another” variety of hippomarathron, %0awith a long narrow leaf, and a seed like that of coriander. %0a%0aThe seed of the cultivated fennel is medicinally employed in %0awine, for the stings of scorpions and serpents, and the juice of %0ait, injected into the ears, has the effect of destroying small %0aworms that breed there. Fennel is employed as an ingredient %0ain nearly all our seasonings,” vinegar” sauces more particu¬ %0alarly : it is placed also beneath the undercrust of bread. The %0a%0aSee B. viii. c. 41, This plant is the Anethum feniculum of Lin- %0anffius. ^ The seed and roots are still used in medicine, being sudorific, %0adiuretic, and aperitive. %0a%0a” This resinous juice of fennel is no longer employed, or indeed known, %0aFee says, to the curious. %0a%0a” “ Horse marathrumthe Cachrys Libanotis of Linnaeus, probably. %0a%0aThe Seseli tortuosum of Linnaeus, probably. %0a%0aIt is sometimes used at the present day for condiments, as a substitute %0afor anise.

Taken %0ain moderate quantities, it arrests looseness of the bowels, and %0aacts as a diuretic ; a decoction of it is good for gripings of the %0astomach, and taken in drink, it restores the milk. The root, %0ataken in a ptisan,^® purges the kidneys—an effect which is %0aequally produced by a decoction of the juice or of the seed ; the %0aroot is good too, boiled in wine, for dropsy and convulsions. %0aThe leaves are applied to burning tumours, with vinegar, %0aexpel calculi of the bladder, and act as an aphrodisiac. %0a%0a, In whatever wmy it is taken in drink, fennel has the pro¬ %0aperty of promoting the secretion of the seminal fluids; and it %0ais extremely beneficial to the generative organs, whether a de¬ %0acoction of the root in wdne is employed as a fomentation, or %0awhether it is used beaten up in oil. Many persons apply %0afennel with wax to tumours and bruises, and employ the root, %0awith the juice of the plant, or else with honey, for the bites of %0adogs, and with wine for the stings of multipedes. %0a%0aHipporaarathron is more efficacious, in every respect, than %0acultivated fennelit expels calculi more pai ticularly, and, %0ataken with weak wine, is good for the bladder and irregula¬ %0arities of the menstrual discharge. %0a%0aIn this plant, the seed is more efficacious than the root; %0athe dose of either of them being a pinch with two fingers, %0abeaten up, and mixed with the usual drink. Petrichus, who %0awrote a work “ On Serpents,”’® and Micton, wffio wrote a trea¬ %0atise “ On” Botany,” are of opinion that there is nothing in %0aexistence of greater efficacy against serpents than hippoma- %0arathron : indeed, Nicander®® has ranked it by no means among %0athe lowest of antidotes. %0a%0aCHAP. 97.-HEMP : NINE REMEDIES. %0a%0aHemp originally grew'’ in the forests,®’ w'here it is found %0awith a blacker and rougher leaf than in the other®* kinds. %0a%0aSee B. xviii. c. 13. %0a%0a” Their properties, says, are very similar. %0a%0a78 “Ophiaca.” - “ Khizotomumena.” %0a%0aTheriaca, 1. 596. et seq. %0a%0a81 The wild hemp of Pliny is the Althaea cannahma of Linn.^u6; the %0ahemp marsh-mallow. %0a%0a“ The cultivated hemp is the Cannabis satira of Linnaeus. %0a%0a%0a298 %0a%0a%0aflint’s natural histout. %0a%0a%0a[Book XX, %0a%0a%0aHempseed “ it is said, renders men impotent: the juice of %0athis Led will extract worms from the ears, or any insect %0awhich may have entered them, though at the cost of producing %0ahead-ache.

That %0awhich has a single stem, bifurcated® at the top, is generally %0athought to be the female plant. The stalks of it are eaten %0aboiled f and, pickled in brine and honey, they are recom¬ %0amended as particularly beneficial to the stomach if taken, %0ahowever, in too large quantities, they are apt to produce %0ahead-ache. The root of it in doses of one denarius to two %0acyathi of wine, is used in drink for the stings of serpents, and %0athe root itself is applied topically for the same purpose, as %0aalso for the cure of gripings of the stomach. Taken in oil %0aand vinegar, it is used as a check for excessive perspirations, %0ain fevers even. The inspissated juice of fennel-giant, taken %0ain quantities the size of a bean, acts as a purgative and the %0apith® of it is good for the uterus, as well as all the maladies %0apreviously mentioned.

That, %0ahowever, would hardly appear to be the sense of the passage. In B. xix. %0ac. 56, he speaks of it being dried and used as a seasoning. %0a%0aFennel-giant is considered to be a good stomachic. %0a%0aThis, Fee thinks, is probably the fact. %0a%0aThe pith, in reality, of the Hmbellifer®, is insipid and inert. %0a%0a%0aChap 100.] THE COMPOSITION OF THEUIACA. %0a%0a%0a299 %0a%0a%0apith of the plant.

Castor was of %0aopinion that the juice of the root is extremely beneficial to %0athe sight. %0a%0aCHAP. 99. -THE THISTLE OR SCOLTMOS : SIX REMEDIES. %0a%0aWe have already spoken, when treating of the garden %0aplants, of the cultivation of the thistle; we may as well, %0atherefore, not delay to mention its medicinal properties. Of %0awild thistles there are two varieties; one®^ of which throws %0aout numerous stalks immediately it leaves the ground, the %0aother®® being thicker, and having but a single stem. They %0ahave, both of them, a few leaves only, and covered with %0aprickles, the head of the plant being protected by thorny %0apoints : the last mentioned, however, puts forth in the middle %0aof these points a purple blossom, which turns white with %0agreat rapidity, and is carried off by the wind; the Greeks %0agive it the name of “ scolymos.” %0a%0aThis plant, gathered before it blossoms, and beaten up and %0asubjected to pressure, produces a juice, which, applied to the %0ahead, makes the hair grow again when it has fallen off through %0aalopecy. The root of either kind, boiled in water, creates %0athirst, it is said, in those who drink it. It strengthens the %0astomach also, and if we are to believe w^hat is said, has some %0ainfluence upon the womb in promoting the conception of male %0aoffspring: at all events, Glaucias, who seems to have paid %0athe most attention to the subject, has written to that eftect.y %0aThe thin juice, like mastich, which exudes from these planW^ %0aimparts sweetness to the breath.

Galen speaks of him as being held in %0agreat repute among the Greeks. %0a%0aHe flourislied in the fourth century b.c., and belonged to the medi¬ %0acal sect of the Dogmatici. He wrote some medical works, of which no¬ %0athing but a few fragments remain. %0a%0aHe lived probably about the beginning of the third century b.c., as %0ahe was the tutor of Antigenes and Miiemon. He seems to have been %0afamous for his medicinal prescriptions of wine, and the quantities of cold %0awater which he gave to his patients. %0a%0aBorn either in Sicily or at Locri Epizephyrii, in Italy. He is sup¬ %0aposed to have lived in the fourth century b.c. By some persons he was %0athought to have been one of the founders of the sect of the Empirici. He %0awrote works on Materia Medica and Cookery, and is several times quoted %0aby Pliny and Galen. See end of B. vii. %0a%0aA Greek herbalist, who lived about the beginning of the first cen¬ %0atury b.c. He is mentioned by Galen as one of the most eminent writers %0aon Materia Medica.

And let no one, misled by %0a%3c the apparent triviality of the names which we shall have to %0a%3c employ, regard this subject as one that is frivolous or con¬ %0a%3c temptible : for we shall here have to set forth the state of peace %0a%3c or of war which exists between the various departments of %0a%3c Nature, the hatreds or friendships which are maintained by %0a%3c objects dumb and destitute of sense, and all, too, created—a %0a%3c wonderful subject for our contemplation !—for the sake of man %0a%3c alone. To these states, known to the Greeks by the respec¬ %0a%3c tive appellations "sympathia” and “ antipathia,” we are in¬ %0a%3c debted for the first principles^ of all things ; for hence it is that %0a%3c water has the property of extinguishing fire, that the sun %0a%3c absorbs water, that the moon produces it, and that each of %0a%3c those heavenly bodies is from time to time eclipsed by the %0a%3c other. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence it is, too, descending from the contemplation of a %0a%3c loftier sphere, that the loadstone® possesses the property of at- %0a%3c %0a%3c ^ Fee remarks, that the commencement of this exordium is contrary to %0a%3c truth, and that Pliny appears to forget that in the Eighteenth Book he %0a%3c has treated, at very considerable length, of the various cereals, the art of %0a%3c preparing bread, pottages, ptisans. &c. lie suggests, that the author may %0a%3c have originally intended to place the Eighteenth Hook after the present %0a%3c one, and that on changing his plan he may have neglected to alter the pre¬ %0a%3c sent passage. From his mention, however, of man’s “ignorance by what %0a%3c means he exists,” it is not improbable that be may have considered that %0a%3c the nutritive qualities of plants are really based upon their medicinal vir¬ %0a%3c tues, a point of view little regarded by the majority of mankind in his %0a%3c time, but considered by Pliny to be the true key to a just appreciation of %0a%3c their utility. ^ “Q„ibus cuncta constant.” Sec B. xxiv. c. 1. %0a%3c %0a%3c * -See B. xxxiv. c. 42. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Cliap. 2.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c THE WILD CUCUMBER. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 207 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c tractiiig iron, and unotlier stone,^ again, that of repelling it; %0a%3c and that the diamond, tliat pride of luxury and opulence, %0a%3c though infrangible by every other object, and presenting a %0a%3c resistance that cannot be overcome, is broken asunder by a %0a%3c lie-goat’s blood ®—in addition to numerous other marvels of %0a%3c ■which we shall have to speak on more appropriate occasions, %0a%3c equal to this or still more wonderful even.

(1.)-THE AVILD CUCUMBER; TWENTY-SIX REMEDIES. %0a%3c %0a%3c We haA'e already stated® that there is a wild cucumber, con¬ %0a%3c siderably smaller than the cultivated one. From this cucum¬ %0a%3c ber the medicament known as “ elaterium” is prepared, being %0a%3c the juice extracted from tbe seed.'' To obtain this juice the %0a%3c fruit is cut before it is ripe—indeed, if this precaution is not %0a%3c taken at an early period, the seed is apt to spirt® out and be pro¬ %0a%3c ductive of danger to the eyes. After it is gathered, the fruit is %0a%3c kept AV’hole for a night, and on the following day an incision %0a%3c is made in it with a reed. The seed, too, is generally sprinkled %0a%3c Avith ashes, Avith the view of retaining in it as large a quan¬ %0a%3c tity of the juice as possible. When the juice is extracted, it %0a%3c is received in rain Avater, where it falls to the bottom; after %0a%3c which it is thickened in the sun, and then divided into lozenges, %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c * Tlie “ theamedrs.” Sec B. xxxvi. c. 25. %0a%3c %0a%3c * Pliny is the only author who makes mention of this singularly absurd %0a%3c notion. %0a%3c %0a%3c ® In B. xix. c. 24 : so, too, Dioscorides, B. iv. c. 154. Tbe wild cu¬ %0a%3c cumber of Pliny, as Fee observes, is in reality not a cucumber, but a %0a%3c totally different plant, the Cucumis silvestris asiuinus of C. iiauhin, the' %0a%3c Momordica elaterium of Linmeus, or squirting cucumber. %0a%3c %0a%3c ’’ Elaterium, Fee says, is not extracted from the seed, but is the juice %0a%3c of the fruit itself, as Pliny, contradicting himself, elsewhere informs us. %0a%3c Theophrastus commits the same error, which Dioscorides does not; and %0a%3c it is not improbable that Pliny has copied from two sources the method %0a%3c of making it. %0a%3c %0a%3c “ Meanino- tbe juice and seed combined, probably. Fee thinks that it %0a%3c is to this the medicament owes its name, from tXdovw. to “ drive” or %0a%3c “impel.” It is much more pi-obable, howeA'er, that the medicine was so %0a%3c called from its strong purgative powers; for, as Galen tells us, iXarj/pme %0a%3c was a name given to purgative medicines ui general. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 208 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c PLINi’s NATUUAL HISTOllY. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Oook XX. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c which are of singular utility to mankiml for healing dimness’ %0a%3c of sight, diseases of the eyes, and ulcerations of the eyelids. %0a%3c It is said that if the roots of a vine are touched with this %0a%3c juice, the grapes of it will be sure never to be attacked by %0a%3c birds. %0a%3c %0a%3c The root,*® too, of the wild cucumber, boiled in vinegar, is %0a%3c employed in fomentations for the gout, and the juice of it is %0a%3c used as a remedy for tooth-ache.

Even after it has been kept so long as fifty*® %0a%3c years, it retains its property of extinguishing a light; indeed, %0a%3c %0a%3c ® Dioscorides, B. iv. c. 1.54, states to this effect. Fee remarks that, %0a%3c singularly enough, most of tlie antiophthahnics used by the ancients, were %0a%3c composed of acrid and almost corrosive medicaments, quite in opposition to %0a%3c the sounder notions entertained on the subject by the moderns. %0a%3c %0a%3c Dioscorides says the same; and much the same statements are made %0a%3c by Cclsus, Apuleius, Marcellus Empiricus, and Plinius Valerianus.

The elaterium which is pale, %0a%3c smooth, and slightly bitter, is superior to that which has a %0a%3c grass-green appearance and is rough to the touch. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is generally thought that the seed of this plant will faci¬ %0a%3c litate conception if a woman carries it attached to her person, %0a%3c before it has touched the ground ; and that it has the effect of %0a%3c aiding parturition, if it is flrst wrapped in ram’s wool, and then %0a%3c tied round the woman’s loins, without her knowing it, care %0a%3c being taken to carry it out of the house the instant she is %0a%3c delivered. %0a%3c %0a%3c Those persons who magnify the praises of the wild cucum¬ %0a%3c ber say that the very best is that of Arabia, the next being %0a%3c that of Arcadia, and then that of Cyrenae : it bears a resem¬ %0a%3c blance to the heliotropium,^® they say, and the fruit, about the %0a%3c size of a walnut, grows between the leaves and branches.

Indeed, %0a%3c there are some persons who give to this cucumber the name of %0a%3c “ scorpionium,” and say that its seed, as well as the elaterium, %0a%3c is remarkably efficacious as a cure for the sting of the scor¬ %0a%3c pion.

This powder %0a%3c is employed also in cosmetics*® for smoothing the skin. The %0a%3c rind, too, has the effect*® of promoting vomiting, and, when %0a%3c applied to the face, of clearing the skin; a result which is %0a%3c equally produced by an external application of the leaves of all %0a%3c the cultivated cucumbers. These leaves, mixed with honey, %0a%3c are emploj'ed for the cure of the pustules known as “ epi- %0a%3c nyctis;”*^ steeped in wine, they are good, too, for the bites %0a%3c of dogs and of multipedes,** insects known to the Greeks by %0a%3c the name of “seps,”**of an elongated form, with hairy legs, %0a%3c and noxious to cattle more particularly; the sting being fol¬ %0a%3c lowed by swelling, and the wound rapidly putrifying. %0a%3c %0a%3c The smell of the cucumber itself is a restorative*^ in fainting %0a%3c fits.

It is said, too, that onions are soporific,® and that they %0a%3c are a cure for ulcerations of the mouth, if chewed with bread. %0a%3c Fresh onions in vinegar, applied topically, or dried onions with %0a%3c wine and honey, are good for the bites of dogs, care being %0a%3c taken not to remove the bandage till the end of a couple of %0a%3c days. Applied, too, in the same way, they are good for heal¬ %0a%3c ing excoriations. Roasted in hot ashes, many persons have %0a%3c applied them topically, with barley meal, for defluxions of the %0a%3c eyes and ulcerations of the genitals. The juice, too, is em¬ %0a%3c ployed as an ointment for sores of the eyes, albugo,® and %0a%3c argema.^ Mixed with honey, it is used as a liniment for the %0a%3c stings® of serpents and all kinds of ulcei'ous sores. In com¬ %0a%3c bination with woman’s milk, it is employed for affections of the %0a%3c ears ; and in cases of singing in the ears and hardness of hear¬ %0a%3c ing, it is injected into those organs with goose-grease or honey. %0a%3c %0a%3c * The Inula Helenium of botanists.

Other kinds of ulcers, too, are treated wdth leeks %0a%3c beaten up with honey: used with vinegar, they are exten¬ %0a%3c sively employed also for the bites of wild beasts, as well as %0a%3c of serpents and other venomous creatures. Mixed with goats’ %0a%3c gall, or else honied wine in equal proportions, they are used %0a%3c for affections of the ears, and, combined with woman’s milk, %0a%3c for singing in the ears. In cases of head-ache, the juice is %0a%3c injected into the nostrils, or else into the ear at bed-time, %0a%3c two spoonfuls of juice to one of honey. %0a%3c %0a%3c This juice is taken too with pure wine,'® for the stings of %0a%3c serpents and scorpions, and, mixed with a semi-sextarius of %0a%3c wine, for lumbago.

It is taken in drink also for the stings of serpents ; %0a%3c and of its leaves, mixed with oil, a most valuable liniment is %0a%3c made for bruises on the body, even when they have swelled %0a%3c and formed blisters. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hippocrates®* is of opinion also, that fumigations made with %0a%3c garlic have the effect of bringing away the after-hirth; and %0a%3c he used to employ the ashes of garlic, mixed with oil, for the %0a%3c cure of running ulcers of the head. Some persons have pro¬ %0a%3c scribed boiled garlic for asthmatic patients ; while others, %0a%3c again, have given it raw. Diodes prescribes it, in combina¬ %0a%3c tion with centaury, for dropsy, and to be taken in a split fig, %0a%3c to promote the alvine evacuations : taken fresh, however, in %0a%3c unmixod wine, with coriander, it is still more efficacious for %0a%3c that purpose. Some persons have given it, beaten up in %0a%3c milk, for asthma. Praxagoras used to prescribe garlic, mixed %0a%3c with wine, for jaundice, and with oil and pottage for the iliac %0a%3c passion:-he employed it also in a similar form, as a liniment %0a%3c for scrofulous swellings of the neck. %0a%3c %0a%3c The ancients used to give raw garlic in cases of madness, %0a%3c and Diodes administered it boiled for phrenitis. Beaten up, %0a%3c and taken in vinegar and w'ater, it is very useful as a gargle %0a%3c for quinsy. Three heads of garlic, beaten up in vinegar, give %0a%3c relief in toothache : and a similar result is obtained by rinsing %0a%3c the mouth with a decoction of garlic, and inserting pieces ol' %0a%3c it in the hollow teeth.

Boiled in %0a%3c oxyrael, it has the effect of expelling tape-worm and other %0a%3c intestinal wmrms ; and a pottage made of it is a cure for te¬ %0a%3c nesmus. A decoction of garlic is applied topically for pains %0a%3c ia the temples; and first boiled and then beaten up with %0a%3c honey, it is good for blisters. A decoction of it, with stale %0a%3c grease, or milk, is excellent for a cough; and Mdiere per¬ %0a%3c sons are troubled with spitting of blood or purulent matter, %0a%3c it may be roasted in hot ashes, and taken Avith honey in %0a%3c equal proportions.

It is applied to the eyes, too, in wool, as a remedy %0a%3c for defluxions of those organs. %0a%3c %0a%3c This juice also purges the bowels, taken in doses of two oboli %0a%3c in vinegar and water. Drunk in wine it is a cure for the %0a%3c stings of serpents, and the leaves and stalk of the plant are %0a%3c pounded and taken in vinegar. They are employed also as a %0a%3c liniment for wounds, the sting of the scorpion more particu¬ %0a%3c larly ; combined, too, with oil and vinegar, they are similai ly %0a%3c applied for the bite of the phalaugium.®® They have the %0a%3c effect, also, of neutralizing other poisons, with the exception %0a%3c of those which kill by suffocation or by attacking the bladder, %0a%3c 'as also with the exception of white lead. Steeped in oxymel, %0a%3c they are applied to the abdomen for the purpose of drawing out %0a%3c vicious humours of the intestines. The juice is found good, %0a%3c also, in cases of retention of the urine.

We have already made %0a%3c mention,®* to some extent, of the peculiar properties of the %0a%3c cultivated lettuce, such as promoting sleep, allaying the sexual %0a%3c passions, cooling the body when heated, purging®* the stomach, %0a%3c and making blood. In addition to these, it possesses no few %0a%3c properties besides; for it has the effect of removing flatulency, %0a%3c and of dispelling eructations, while at the same time it pro¬ %0a%3c motes the digestion, without ever being indigestible itself. %0a%3c Indeed, there is no article of diet known that is a greater sti¬ %0a%3c mulant to the appetite, or which tends in a greater degree to %0a%3c %0a%3c “ Lactucarium,” or the inspissated milky juice of the garden lettuce, %0a%3c is still used occasionally as a substitute for opium, having slightly anodyne %0a%3c properties, but, as Fee remarks, all that Pliny says here of its effects is %0a%3c erroneous. “ Adustiones“ burns,” perhaps. %0a%3c %0a%3c A kind of spider.

They have the effect, also, of %0a%3c attenuating the tough, viscous, phlegm, and, according to what %0a%3c some persons say, of sharpening the senses.

White lettuces, too, %0a%3c are prescribed in large quantities for melancholy and affections %0a%3c of the bladder. Praxagoras recommends them for dysentery. %0a%3c Lettuces are good, also, for recent burns, before blisters have %0a%3c made their appearance : in such cases they are applied with %0a%3c salt. They arrest spreading ulcers, being applied at first with %0a%3c saltpetre, and afterwards with Avine. Eeateu up, they are %0a%3c applied topically for erysipelas; and the stalks, beaten up %0a%3c with polenta, and applied with cold water, are soothing for %0a%3c luxations of the limbs and spasmodic contractions ; used, too, %0a%3c with wine and polenta, they are good for pimples and erup¬ %0a%3c tions.

White beet, boiled %0a%3c and eaten with raw garlic, is taken for tapeworm ; the root, %0a%3c too, of the black kind, similarly boiled in water, removes por- %0a%3c rigo ; indeed, it is generally stated, that the black beet is the %0a%3c more efficacious®* of the two. The juice of black beet is good %0a%3c for inveterate head-aches and vertigo, and injected into the %0a%3c ears, it stops singing in those organs. It is a diuretic, also, %0a%3c and employed in injections is a cure for dysentery and jaun¬ %0a%3c dice. %0a%3c %0a%3c This juice, used as a liniment, allays tooth-ache, and is good %0a%3c for the stings of serpents ; but due care must be taken that it is %0a%3c extracted from this root only. A decoction, too, of beet-root %0a%3c is a remedy for chilblains. %0a%3c %0a%3c A liniment of white beet-root applied to the forehead, %0a%3c arrests defluxions of the eyes, and mixed with a little alum it %0a%3c is an excellent remedy for erysipelas.

They are both of them bitter, but %0a%3c are extremely beneficial to the stomach, when distressed by %0a%3c humours more particularly. Used as food with vinegar, they %0a%3c are cooling, and, employed as a liniment, they dispel other %0a%3c liumours besides those of the stomach.

(9).- THE C.ABB.AGE : EIGHTY-SEVEN REMEDIES. RE¬ %0a%3c %0a%3c CIPES MENTIONED BY CATO. %0a%3c %0a%3c It would be too lengthy a task to enumerate all the prais( s %0a%3c of the cabbage, more particularly as the physician Chrysippus %0a%3c has devoted a whole volume to the subject, in Avhich its Aur- %0a%3c tues are described in reference to each individual part of the %0a%3c human body. Dieuches has done the same, and Pythagoras %0a%3c too, in particular. Cato, too, has not been more sparing in its %0a%3c ])raises than the others; and it Avill be only right to examine %0a%3c the opinions which he expresses in relation to it, if for no %0a%3c other purpose than to learn Avhat medicines the Homan people %0a%3c made use of for six hundred years. %0a%3c %0a%3c The most ancient Greek Avriters have distinguished three"* %0a%3c A'arieties of the cabbage ; the curly” cabbage, to which they %0a%3c %0a%3c ” The kind known as garden endive, the Cichorium endivia of Linnaeus. %0a%3c %0a%3c ” “ Antbologuniena.” See 15. xix. c. 41. - ” “ Crispam.” %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 2.36 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c PLINr’s NATURAL HISTORY. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XX. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c have given the name of “ selinoYcles,”’® from the resemblance %0a%3c of its leaf to that of parslej’, beneficial to the stomach, and %0a%3c moderately relaxing to the bowels; the " helia,” with broad %0a%3c leaves running out from the stalk—a circumstance, owing to %0a%3c which some persons have given it the name of “ canlodes”— %0a%3c of no use whatever in a medicinal point of view ; and a third, %0a%3c the name of which is properly “crambe,” with thinner leaves, %0a%3c of simple form, and closely packed, more bitter than the others, %0a%3c but extremely efiicacious in medicine.” %0a%3c %0a%3c Cato’® esteems the curly cabbage the most highly of all, %0a%3c and next to it, the smooth cabbage with large leaves and %0a%3c a thick stalk. He says that it is a good thing for head¬ %0a%3c ache, dimness of the sight, and dazzling’® of the eyes, the %0a%3c spleen, stomach, and thoracic organs, taken raw in the mcjm- %0a%3c ing, in doses of two acetabula, with oxymel, coriander, rue, %0a%3c mint, and root of silphium.®® He says, too, that the virtue of %0a%3c it is so great that the very person even who beats up this mix¬ %0a%3c ture feels himself all the stronger for it; for which reason he %0a%3c recommends it to be taken mixed with these condiments, or, %0a%3c at all events, dressed with a sauce compounded of them. For %0a%3c the gout, too, and diseases of the joints, a liniment of it should %0a%3c be used, he says, with a little rue and coriander, a sprinkling %0a%3c of salt, and some barley meal: the verj^ water even in which %0a%3c it has been boiled is wonderfully efficacious, according to him, %0a%3c for the sinews and joints. For wounds, either recent or of %0a%3c long standing, as also for carcinoma,®* which is incurable by %0a%3c any other mode of treatment, he recommends fomentations to %0a%3c be made with warm water, and, after that, an application of %0a%3c cabbage, beaten up, to the parts affected, twice a-day. He says, %0a%3c also, that fistulas and sprains should be treated in a similar %0a%3c way, as well as all humours which it may be desirable to bring %0a%3c to a head and disperse; and he states that this vegetable, %0a%3c boiled and eaten fasting, in considerable quantities, with oil %0a%3c %0a%3c 76 “ Parsley-like.” %0a%3c %0a%3c ’’’’ The only use now made of the cabbage, in a medicinal point of view, %0a%3c is the extraction from the red cabbage, which is rich in sacciiarine matter, %0a%3c of a pectoral, and the employment of the round cabbage, in the form of %0a%3c sour-krout, as an antiscorbutic. The great majority of the statements as %0a%3c to the virtues of the cabbage, though supported by Cato, and in a great %0a%3c measure by Hippocrates, are utterly fallacious. %0a%3c %0a%3c ’* De Re Rust. 157. ’'® “ Scintillatianibus.” %0a%3c %0a%3c See B. xix. c. 15.

They are of opinion that %0a%3c cabbage, not thoroughly boiled, carries off the bile, and has %0a%3c the effect of loosening the bowels ; while, on the other hand, %0a%3c if it is boiled twice over, it will act as an astringent.

Squills, too, if chewed by themselves %0a%3c even, are good for the gums and teeth; and taken in vinegar %0a%3c and honey they expel tapeworm and other intestinal worms. %0a%3c Put fresh beneath the tongue, they prevent persons afflicted %0a%3c with dropsy from experiencing thii’st. %0a%3c %0a%3c Squills are cooked in various ways; either in a pot with a %0a%3c lining of clay or grease, which is put into an oven or furnace, %0a%3c or else cut into pieces and stewed in a saucepan.

The root is also looked upon as diuretic. %0a%3c %0a%3c Asparagus seed is not used in modern pharmacy, and it is very doubt¬ %0a%3c ful if it possesses any virtues at all. %0a%3c %0a%3c Fee says that there is no truth in this assertion. %0a%3c %0a%3c See B. xix. c. 42 : the Asparagus tenuifolius of Linnaeus, the wild %0a%3c asp.iragus, or Corruda of the South of France. %0a%3c %0a%3c Fee says that in the South of Europe there is a kind, known to bota¬ %0a%3c nists as white asparagus, with a prickly stem : he suggests that it may %0a%3c possibly be the same as that here spoken of. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 246 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c flint’s natubal iiistout. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XX. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c oboli respectively.

He says, however, that though employed %0a%3c this way, it is a good diuretic, it is bad for dropsy, and %0a%3c acts as an antaphrodisiac; and that it is injurious to the %0a%3c bladder, unless it is boiled first.*‘ He states also, that if the %0a%3c water in which it is boiled is given to dogs, it will kill them %0a%3c and that the juice of the root boiled in wine, kept in the mouth, %0a%3c is an effectual cure for tooth-ache. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 44. (11.) -PAKSLET ; SEVENTEEN EEMEDIES. %0a%3c %0a%3c Parsley*® is held in universal esteem; for we find sprigs of %0a%3c it swimming in the draughts of milk given us to drink in %0a%3c country-places; and we know that as a seasoning for sauces, it %0a%3c is looked upon with peculiar favour. Applied to the eyes with %0a%3c honey, which must also be fomented from time to time with a %0a%3c warm decoction of it, it has a most marvellous efficacy in cases %0a%3c of defluxion of those organs or of other parts of the body; as %0a%3c also when beaten up and applied by itself, or in combination %0a%3c with bread or with polenta. Fish, too, when found to be in %0a%3c an ailing state in the preserves, are greatly refreshed by %0a%3c giving them green parsley. As to the opinions entertained %0a%3c upon it among the learned, there is not a single production %0a%3c dug out of the earth in reference to which a greater diversity %0a%3c exists. %0a%3c %0a%3c ■9 Or fennel. Fee says that, till very recently, the roots of asparagus %0a%3c and of fennel were combined in medicine, forming part of the five “ major %0a%3c aperitive ” roots. The sirop of the five aperitive roots is still used, he says, %0a%3c in medicine. %0a%3c %0a%3c 91 Chrysippus and Dioscorides were of opinion, that a decoction of as¬ %0a%3c paragus root causes sterility in women ; a false notion, which, as Fee re¬ %0a%3c marks, prevailed very generally in Greece. %0a%3c %0a%3c 99 This is not consistent with fact. %0a%3c %0a%3c _ 99 See B. xix. c. 37. Parsley, though possessed of marked properties, %0a%3c IS but little employed in medicine. What Pliny here states respecting it, %0a%3c Fee says, is a tissue of fables : hut it is still used for the cure of sores, and %0a%3c even as an ophthalmic. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 45.] APIASTBUM, OE MELTSSOPHTLLUM. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 247 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Parsley is distinguished as male and female according to %0a%3c Chrysippus, the female plant has a hard leaf and more curled %0a%3c than the other, a thick stem, and an acrid, hot taste. Dio¬ %0a%3c nysius says, that the female is darker than the other kind, %0a%3c has a shorter root, and engenders small worms.“ Both of %0a%3c these writers, however, agree in saying that neither kind of %0a%3c parsley should be admitted into the number of our aliments; %0a%3c indeed, they look upon it as nothing less than sacrilege to do so, %0a%3c seeing that parsley is consecrated to the funereal feasts in honour %0a%3c of the dead. They say, too, that it is injurious to the eye¬ %0a%3c sight, that the stalk of the female plant engenders small worms, %0a%3c for which reason it is that those who eat of it become barren— %0a%3c males as well as females; and that children suckled by females %0a%3c who live on a parsley diet, are sure to be epileptic. They %0a%3c agree, however, in stating that the male plant is not so inju¬ %0a%3c rious in its effects as the female, and that it is for this reason %0a%3c that it is not absolutely condemned and classed among the for¬ %0a%3c bidden plants. The leaves of it, employed as a cataplasm, are %0a%3c used for dispersing hard tumours^® in the mamillae; and when %0a%3c boiled in water, it makes it more agreeable to drink. The %0a%3c juice of the root more particularly, mixed with wine, allays %0a%3c the pains of lumbago, and, injected into the ears, it dimihishes %0a%3c hardness of hearing. The seed of it acts as a diuretic, pro¬ %0a%3c motes the menstrual discharge, and brings away the after¬ %0a%3c birth. %0a%3c %0a%3c Bruises and livid spots, if fomented with a decoction of %0a%3c parsley.seeed, will resume their natural colour. Applied to¬ %0a%3c pically, with the white of egg, or boiled in water, and then %0a%3c drunk, it is remedial for affections of the kidneys; and beaten %0a%3c up in cold water it is a cure for ulcers of the mouth. The %0a%3c seed, mixed with wine, or the root, taken with old wine, has %0a%3c the effect of breaking calculi in the bladder.

Hence he comes to the conclusion, %0a%3c that the use of it ought to be avoided by man. Some persons %0a%3c go so far as to say, that if beaten up, and then placed beneath %0a%3c a stone, a scorpion will breed there and that if chewed, and %0a%3c then placed in the sun, worms will breed in it. The people of %0a%3c Africa maintain, too, that if a person is stung by a scorpion %0a%3c the same day on which he has eaten ocimum, his life cannot %0a%3c possibly be saved. Even more than this, there are some who %0a%3c assert, that if a handful of ocimum is beaten up with ten sea %0a%3c or river crabs, all the scorpions in the vicinity will be attracted %0a%3c to it. Diodotus, too, in his Book of Recipes, says, that %0a%3c ocimum, used as an article of food, breeds lice. %0a%3c %0a%3c Succeeding ages, again, have warmly defended this plant; it %0a%3c has been maintained, for instance, that goats do eat it, that %0a%3c the aiind of no one who, has eaten of it is at all affected, and, %0a%3c that mixed with wine, with the addition of a little vinegar, it is %0a%3c a cure for the stings of land scorpions, and the venom of those %0a%3c found in the sea. Experience has proved, too, that the smell %0a%3c of this plant in vinegar is good for fainting fits and lethargy, %0a%3c %0a%3c ticum or Agriopastinaca of Crete; but, as Fee remarks, it is not clear to %0a%3c which of the Umbelliferaj he refers under that name. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Ocimum basilicum of Linnneus, according to most commentators: %0a%3c though F6e is not of that opinion, it being originally from India, and never %0a%3c found in a wild state. From what Varro says, De He Rust. B. i. c. 31, %0a%3c he thinks that it must be sought among the leguminous plants, the genus %0a%3c Hedysariim, Lathyrus, or Medicago. He remarks also, that Pliny is the %0a%3c more to be censured for the absurdities contained in this Chapter, as the %0a%3c preceding writers had only mentioned them to ridicule them. %0a%3c %0a%3c See B. ix. c. 51. %0a%3c %0a%3c ^ “ In Empericis.’' %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 250 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c PLIirr’S NATURAL niBTORT. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XX. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c as well as inflammations; that employed as a cooling lini¬ %0a%3c ment, with rose oil, myrtle oil, or vinegar, it is good for head¬ %0a%3c ache ; and that applied topically with wine, it is beneficial for %0a%3c defluxions of the eyes. It has been found also, that it is good %0a%3c for the stomach ; that taken with vinegar, it dispels flatulent %0a%3c eructations; that applioations of it arrest fluxes of the bowels ; %0a%3c that it acts as a diuretic, and that in this way it is good for %0a%3c jaundice and dropsy, as well as cholera and looseness of the %0a%3c bowels. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence it is that Philistio has prescribed it even for cceliac %0a%3c affections, and boiled, for dysentery. Some persons, too, %0a%3c though contrary to the opinion of Plistonicus, have given it %0a%3c in wine for tenesmus and spitting of blood, as also for ob¬ %0a%3c structions of the viscera. It is employed, too, as a liniment %0a%3c for the mamillae, and has the effect of arresting the secretion %0a%3c of the milk. It is very good also for the ears of infants, when %0a%3c applied with goose-grease more particularly. The seed of it, %0a%3c beaten up, and inhaled into the nostrils, is provocative of %0a%3c sneezing, and applied as a liniment to the head, of running %0a%3c at the nostrils: taken in the food, too, with vinegar, it purges %0a%3c the uterus.

Wild ocimum has exactly the same properties in every %0a%3c respect, though in a more active degree. It is particularly %0a%3c good, too, for the various affections produced by excessive vo¬ %0a%3c miting, and for abscesses of the womb.

The Romans, singularly enough, %0a%3c valued this oifensive plant as a condiment for their dishes, and a seasoning %0a%3c for their wines.—See B. xiv. c. 19 : and at the present day even, it is ad¬ %0a%3c mired for its smell. Fee says, by the ladies of Naples. The Italians use %0a%3c it also for their salads. ^ Its smell is thought to prevent infection, for which %0a%3c re^on it is still iwed, in country-places, at funerals, and is placed before %0a%3c prisoners when tried criminally, for the prevention, it is said, of gaol fever. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 61.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c HUE. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 253 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c boxes of Cyprian copper.

Thus do we find %0a%3c one thing acting as the poison of another poison, for the juice %0a%3c of hemlock is very beneficial, rubbed upon the hands and %0a%3c [face]®® of persons employed in gathering rue. %0a%3c %0a%3c In other respects, rue is one of the principal ingredients %0a%3c employed in antidotes, that of Galatia more particularly. %0a%3c Every species of rue, employed by itself, has the effect also of %0a%3c an antidote, if the leaves are bruised and taken in wine. It %0a%3c is good more particularly in cases of poisoning by wolfsbane®^ %0a%3c and mistletoe, as well as by fungi, Avhether administered in the %0a%3c drink or the food. Employed in a similar manner, it is good %0a%3c for the stings of serpents ; so much so, in fact, that weasels,®® %0a%3c when about to attack them, take the precaution first of pro¬ %0a%3c tecting themselves by eating rue. Eue is good, too, for the %0a%3c injuries by scorpions and spiders, the stings of bees, hornets, %0a%3c and wasps, the noxious effects produced by cantharides and %0a%3c salamanders,®® and the bites of mad dogs. The juice is taken %0a%3c in doses of one acetabulum, in Avine; and the leaves, beaten %0a%3c up or else chewed, are applied topically, Avith honey and %0a%3c salt, or boiled Avith A’inegar and pitch. It is said that people %0a%3c rubbed Avuth the juice of rue, or even having it on their per¬ %0a%3c son, are never attacked by these noxious creatures, and that %0a%3c serpents are driven awaj'^ by the stench of burning rue. The %0a%3c most efficacious, however, of all, is the root of wild rue, taken %0a%3c with wine; this too, it is said, is more beneficial stiU, if %0a%3c drunk in the open air. %0a%3c %0a%3c Pythagoras has distinguished this plant also into male and %0a%3c %0a%3c ®* It is not the rue that has this effect, so much as the salts of copper %0a%3c which are formed. %0a%3c %0a%3c Fee thinks it not likely that the rue grown here was at all superior %0a%3c to that of other localities. %0a%3c %0a%3c This word, omitted in the text, is supplied from Dioscorides. %0a%3c %0a%3c Or aconite. There is no truth whatever in these assertions, that rue %0a%3c lias the effect of neutralizing the effects of hemlock, henbane, or poisonous %0a%3c fungi. Boerrhave says that he employed rue successfully in cases of hyste¬ %0a%3c ria and epilepsy; and it is an opinion which originated with Hippocrates, %0a%3c and is still pretty generally entertained, that it promotes the catamenia. %0a%3c %0a%3c ®® See B.

The same author, too, %0a%3c has considered rue to be injurious to the eyes ; but this is an %0a%3c error, for engravers and painters are in the habit of eating it %0a%3c with bread, or else nasturtium, for the benefit of the sight; %0a%3c wild goats, too, eat it for the sight, they say. Many persons %0a%3c have dispersed films on the eyes by rubbing them with a mix¬ %0a%3c ture of the juice of rue with Attic honey, or the milk of a %0a%3c woman just delivered of a male child : the same result has %0a%3c been produced also by touching the corners of the eyes with %0a%3c the pure juice of the plant. Applied topically, mu th polenta, %0a%3c rue carries off defluxions of the eyes; and, taken with M ine, %0a%3c or applied topically Muth vinegar and rose oil, it is a cure for %0a%3c head-ache. If, hoM^ever, the pain attacks the M'hole of the %0a%3c head,®’ the rue should be applied with barley-meal and vin¬ %0a%3c egar. This plant has the effect also of dispelling crudities, %0a%3c flatulency, and inveterate pains of the stomach; it opens the %0a%3c uterus, too, and restores it Avhen displaced; for M'hich purpose %0a%3c it is applied as a liniment, Muth honej^ to the whole of the %0a%3c abdomen and chest. Mixed with figs, and boiled down to %0a%3c one half, it is administered in wine for dropsy ; and it is taken %0a%3c in a similar manner for pains of the chest, sides, and loins, as %0a%3c weU as for coughs, asthma, and affections of the lungs, liver, and %0a%3c kidneys, and for shivering flts. Persons about to indulge in %0a%3c wine, take a decoction of the leaves, to prevent head-ache and %0a%3c surfeit. Taken in food, too, it is wholesome, whether eaten %0a%3c raw or boiled, or used as a confection ; boiled with h3^ssop, %0a%3c and taken with wine, it is good for gripings of the stomach. %0a%3c Employed in the same way, it arrests internal haemorrhage, %0a%3c and, applied to the nostrils, bleeding at the nose : it is beneficial %0a%3c also to the teeth if rinsed with it. In cases of ear-ache, this %0a%3c juice is injected into the ears, care being taken to moderate %0a%3c the dose, as already stated, if wild rue is employed. Tor %0a%3c hardness of hearing, too, and singing in the ears, it is simi¬ %0a%3c larly employed in combination with oil of roses, or oil of laurel, %0a%3c or else cummin and honey. %0a%3c %0a%3c Juice of rue pounded in vinegar, is applied also to the %0a%3c temples and the region of the brain in persons affected M’ilh %0a%3c phrenitis; some persons, however, have added to this mixture %0a%3c %0a%3c ®' “ Si veto sit cephulaea.” %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 51. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c UtTE. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 255 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c wild thyme and laurel leaves, rubbing the head and neck as %0a%3c well with the liniment.

The same author, also, recommends %0a%3c applications of it, as well as fumigations, for affections of the %0a%3c uterus. %0a%3c %0a%3c For cardiac diseases, Diodes prescribes applications of rue, %0a%3c in combination with vinegar, honey, and barley-meal : and %0a%3c for the iliac passion, he says that it should be mixed with %0a%3c meal, boiled in oil, and spread upon the wool of a sheep’s %0a%3c fleece. Many persons recommend, for purulent expectorations, %0a%3c two drachmae of dried rue to one and a half of sulphur; and, %0a%3c for spitting of blood, a decoction of three sprigs in wine. It is %0a%3c given also in dysentery, with cheese, the rue being first beaten %0a%3c up in wine; and it has been prescribed, pounded with bitumen, %0a%3c as a potion for habitual shortness of breath. For persons suf¬ %0a%3c fering from violent falls, three ounces of the seed is recom¬ %0a%3c mended. A pound of oil, in which rue leaves have been %0a%3c boiled, added to one sextarius of wine, forms a liniment for %0a%3c parts of the body which are frost-bitten. If rue really is a %0a%3c diuretic, as Hippocrates®® thinks, it is a singular thing that %0a%3c some persons should give it, as being an anti-diuretic, for the %0a%3c suppression of incontinence of urine. %0a%3c %0a%3c Applied topically, with honey and alum, it cures itch-scabs, %0a%3c and leprous sores; and, in combination with nightshade and %0a%3c hogs’-lard, or beef-suet, it is good for morphew, wmrts, scrofula, %0a%3c and maladies of a similar nature. Used with vinegar and oil, %0a%3c or else white lead, it is good for erysipelas; and, applied witli %0a%3c vinegar, for carbuncles. Some persons prescribe silphium %0a%3c also as an ingredient in the liniment; but it is not employed %0a%3c by them for the cure of the pustules known as epinyctis. %0a%3c Boiled rue is recommended, also, as a cataplasm for swellings %0a%3c %0a%3c ®* Dioscorides says however, B. iii. c. 52, that *it aiTests incontinence %0a%3c of the urine.

The %0a%3c seed pounded, and applied with wax, is remedial also for %0a%3c broken limbs. The root of this plant, applied topically, is a %0a%3c cure for effusion of blood in the eyes, and, employed as a lini¬ %0a%3c ment, it removes scars or spots on all parts of the body. %0a%3c %0a%3c Among the other properties which are attributed to rue, it %0a%3c is a singular fact, that, though it is universally agreed that it %0a%3c is hot by nature, a bunch of it, boiled in rose-oil, with the %0a%3c addition of an ounce of aloes, has the effect of checking the %0a%3c perspiration in those who rub themselves with it; and that, %0a%3c used as an aliment, it impedes the generative functions. %0a%3c Hence it is, that it is so often given in cases of spermatorrhoea, %0a%3c and where persons are subject to lascivious dreams. Every pre¬ %0a%3c caution should be taken by pregnant women to abstain from %0a%3c rue as an article of diet, for I find it stated that it is productive %0a%3c of fatal results to the foetus.®^ %0a%3c %0a%3c Of all the plants that are grown, rue is the one that is most %0a%3c generally employed for the maladies of cattle, whether arising %0a%3c from difficulty of respiration, or from the stings of noxious %0a%3c creatures—in which cases it is injected with wine into the %0a%3c nostrils—or whether they may happen to have swallowed a %0a%3c horse-leech, under which circumstances it is administered in %0a%3c vinegar.

It is generally thought, too, that it is %0a%3c in consequence of this property that it impedes generation, by %0a%3c preventing the seminal fluids from obtaining the requisite con¬ %0a%3c sistency. In males as well as females it arrests bleeding, and %0a%3c it has the property, with the latter, of suspending the men¬ %0a%3c strual discharge. Taken in water, with amylum,’^ it prevents %0a%3c looseness in cceliac complaints. Syriatioii employed this plant %0a%3c for the cure of abscesses of the uterus, and, in doses of %0a%3c three oboli, with honied wine, for diseases of the liver: he %0a%3c prescribed it also, in pottage, for spitting of blood. It is an %0a%3c admirable remedy for ulcerations of the head in children, and %0a%3c has the effect equally of drying the trachea when too moist, %0a%3c and of bracing it when too dry. Taken in honied wine and %0a%3c water, it carries off purulent phlegm. %0a%3c %0a%3c The juice of mint is good for the voice when a person is %0a%3c about to engage in a contest of eloquence, but only when taken %0a%3c just before. It is employed also with milk as a gargle for %0a%3c swelling of the uvula, with the addition of rue and coriander. %0a%3c With alum, too, it is good for the tonsils of the throat, and, %0a%3c mixed with honey, for roughness of the tongue. Employed %0a%3c by itself, it is a remedy for internal convulsions and affections %0a%3c of the lungs. Taken with pomegranate juice, as Democrites %0a%3c tells us, it arrests hiccup and vomiting. The juice of mint %0a%3c fresh gathered, inhaled, is a remedy for affections of the nos¬ %0a%3c trils. Beaten up and taken in vinegar, mint is a cure for %0a%3c cholera, and for internal fluxes of blood : applied externally, %0a%3c with polenta, it is remedial for the iliac passion and tension of %0a%3c the mamillae. It is applied, too, as a liniment to the temples %0a%3c for head-ache ; and it is taken internally, as an antidote for %0a%3c the stings of scolopendrse, sea-scorpions, and serpents. As a %0a%3c liniment it is applied also for defluxions of the eyes, and all %0a%3c eruptions of the head, as well as maladies of the rectum. %0a%3c %0a%3c Mint is an effectual preventive, too, of chafing of the skin, %0a%3c even if held in the hand only. In combination with honied %0a%3c wine, it is employed as an injection for the ears.

It is for this reason that Varro has de¬ %0a%3c clared that a wreath of pennyroyal is more worthy to grace %0a%3c our chambers’® than a chaplet of roses : indeed, it is said that, %0a%3c placed upon the head, it materially alleviates head-ache.” %0a%3c It is generally stated, too, that the smell of it alone will pro¬ %0a%3c tect the head against the injurious effects of cold or heat, and %0a%3c that it acts as a preventive of thirst; also, that persons ex¬ %0a%3c posed to the sun, if they carry a couple of sprigs of penny¬ %0a%3c royal behind the ears, wiU never be incommoded by the heat. %0a%3c For various pains, too, it is employed topically, mixed with %0a%3c polenta and vinegar. %0a%3c %0a%3c The female’® plant is the more efficacious of the two ; it has %0a%3c a purple fiower, that of the male being white. Taken in cold %0a%3c water with salt and polenta it arrests nausea, as w'ell as pains %0a%3c of the chest and abdomen. Taken, too, in w'ater, it prevents %0a%3c gnawing pains of the stomach, and, with vinegar and polenta, %0a%3c it arrests vomiting.

WILD CUMMIN : %0a%3c %0a%3c TWENTY-SIX REMEDIES. %0a%3c %0a%3c Wild cummin is a remarkably slender plant, consisting of %0a%3c four or five leaves indented like a saw ; like the cultivated %0a%3c kind, it is much employed in medicine, among the stomachic %0a%3c remedies more particularly. Bruised and taken with bread, %0a%3c or else drunk in wine and water, it dispels phlegm and flatu¬ %0a%3c lency, as well as gripings of the bowels and pains in the intes¬ %0a%3c tines. Both varieties have the effect, however, of producing %0a%3c paleness®^ in those who drink these mixtures; at all events, it %0a%3c is generally stated that the disciples of Porcius Latro,®* so cele¬ %0a%3c brated among the professors of eloquence, used to employ this %0a%3c drink for the purpose of imitating the paleness which had been %0a%3c contracted by their master, through the intensity of his studies: %0a%3c and that Julius Vindex,®^ in more recent times, that assertor %0a%3c of our liberties against Nero, adopted this method of playing %0a%3c upon those who were looking out for a place in his will. %0a%3c Applied in the form of lozenges, or fresh with vinegar, cummin %0a%3c has the effect of arresting bleeding at the nose, and used by %0a%3c %0a%3c Cummin is the Cuminum cyminum of Linnaeus. The seed only is %0a%3c used, and that but rarely, for medicinal purposes, being a strong excitant %0a%3c and a carminative. In Germany, and Turkey, and other parts of the East, %0a%3c cummin-soed is esteemed as a condiment. %0a%3c %0a%3c Horace, B. i. Epist. 19, says the same; but in reality cummin pro¬ %0a%3c duces no such effect. %0a%3c %0a%3c »- M.

In %0a%3c cases of jaundice, it is administered in white wine, immediately %0a%3c after taking the bath. %0a%3c %0a%3c (15.) The cummin of Ethiopia,®® more particularly, is given %0a%3c in vinegar and water, or else as an electuary with honey. It %0a%3c is thought, too, that the cummin of Africa hjts the peculiar %0a%3c property of arresting incontinence of urine. The cultivated %0a%3c plant is given, parched and beaten up in vinegar, for affections %0a%3c of the liver, as also for vertigo. Beaten up in sweet wine, it %0a%3c is taken in cases, also, where the urine is too acrid; and for %0a%3c affections of the uterus, it is administered in wine, the leaves %0a%3c of it being employed topically as well, in layers of wool. %0a%3c Parched and beaten up with honey, it is used as an application %0a%3c for swellings of the testes, or else with rose oil and wax. %0a%3c %0a%3c For all the purposes above-mentioned, wild cummin is more %0a%3c efficacious than cultivated; as also, in combination with oil, %0a%3c for the stings of serpents, scorpions,-and scolopendrae. A pinch %0a%3c of it with three fingers, taken in wine, has the effect of arrest¬ %0a%3c ing vomiting and nausea; it is used, too, both as a drink and %0a%3c a liniment for the colic, or else it is applied hot, in dossils of %0a%3c lint,®’ to the part affected, bandages being employed to keep it %0a%3c in its place. Taken in wine, it dispels hysterical affections, %0a%3c the proportions being three drachmae of cummin to three cyathi %0a%3c of wine. It is used as an injection, too, for the ears, when %0a%3c affected wdth tingling and singing, being mixed for the purpose %0a%3c with veal suet or honey.

Many persons, however, consider it %0a%3c to be of a totally different nature from cummin, as it is so very %0a%3c much thinner, and of a much Avhiter colour. Still, it is em¬ %0a%3c ployed for just the same piirposes as cummin, for we find it %0a%3c used at Alexandria for putting under loaves of bread, and form¬ %0a%3c ing an ingredient in various sauces. It has the effect of dispel¬ %0a%3c ling flatulency and gripings of the bowels, and of promoting %0a%3c the secretion of the urine and the menstrual discharge. It is %0a%3c employed, also, for the cure of bruises, and to assuage defluxions %0a%3c of the eyes. Taken in wine with linseed, in doses of two %0a%3c drachmae, it is a cure for the stings of scorpions; and, used %0a%3c with an equal proportion of myrrh, it is particularly good for %0a%3c the bite of the cerastes.* %0a%3c %0a%3c Like cummin, too, it imparts paleness of complexion to those %0a%3c who drink of it.

This plant is employed in seasonings to sup¬ %0a%3c ply the place of lovage; and the perfume of it, when burnt %0a%3c and inhaled, alleviates headache. Evenor prescribes an appli¬ %0a%3c cation of the root, pounded, for defluxions of the eyes; and %0a%3c lollas employs it in a similar manner, in combination with %0a%3c saffron and wine, or else beaten up by itself and mixed with %0a%3c polenta, for violent defluxions and the extraction of such ob¬ %0a%3c jects as have got into the eyes : applied, too, as a liniment in %0a%3c water, it arrests cancer of the nose. Mixed with hyssop and %0a%3c oxymel, and employed as a gargle, it is a cure for quinsy; %0a%3c and, in combination with rose oil, it is used as an injection for %0a%3c the ears. Parched anise purges off phlegm from the chest, and, %0a%3c if taken with honey, it is better still. %0a%3c %0a%3c Eor a cough, beat up fifty bitter almonds, shelled, in honey, %0a%3c with one acetabulum of anise. Another very easy remedy, %0a%3c too, is to mix three drachmae of anise with two of poppies and %0a%3c some honey, apiece the size of a bean being taken three times %0a%3c a-day. Its main excellence, however, is as a carminative; %0a%3c hence it is that it is so good for flatulency of the stomach, %0a%3c griping pains of the intestines, and coeliac affections. A de¬ %0a%3c coction of it, smelt at and drunk, arrests hiccup, and a decoc¬ %0a%3c tion of the leaves removes indigestion. A decoction of it with %0a%3c parsley, if applied to the nostrils, will arrest sneezing. Taken %0a%3c in drink, anise promotes sleep, disperses calculi of the bladder, %0a%3c arrests vomiting and swelling of the viscera, and acts as an %0a%3c excellent pectoral for affections of the chest, and of the dia- %0a%3c %0a%3c “Unconquerable,’' from the Greek a, “not,” and viKaw, “to con¬ %0a%3c quer.” Fee thinks that the word is a diminutive of “anisum.” which, %0a%3c according to some persons, is a derivative from “ ant/sun,” the Arabic name %0a%3c of the plant.

Dalion, the herbalist, employed it, %0a%3c with parsley, as a cataplasm for women in labour, as also for %0a%3c pains of the uterus; and, for women in labour, he pre¬ %0a%3c scribes a decoction of anise and dill to be taken in drink. It %0a%3c is used as a liniment also in cases of phrenitis, or else applied %0a%3c fresh gathered and mixed with polenta; in which form it is %0a%3c used also for infants attacked with epilepsy^® or convulsions. %0a%3c Pythagoras,.indeed, assures us that persons, so long as they %0a%3c hold this plant in the hand, will never be attacked with epi¬ %0a%3c lepsy, for which reason, as much of it as possible should be %0a%3c planted near the house; he says, too, that women who inhale %0a%3c the odour of it have a more easy delivery, it being his advice %0a%3c also, that, immediately after they are delivered, it should be %0a%3c given them to drink, with a sprinkling of polenta. %0a%3c %0a%3c Sosimenes employed this plant, in combination with vinegar, %0a%3c for aU kinds of indurations, and for lassitude he prescribes a %0a%3c decoction of it in oil, with the addition of nitre. The same %0a%3c writer pledges his word to all wayfarers, that, if they take %0a%3c aniseed in their drink, they will be comparatively exempt %0a%3c from fatigue^’ on their journey. Heraclides prescribes a pinch %0a%3c of aniseed with three fingers, for infiations of the stomach, to %0a%3c be taken with two oboli of castoreum in honied wine; and he %0a%3c recommends a similar preparation for inflations of the abdomen %0a%3c and intestines.

With reference to the cultivated %0a%3c varieties, the calyx®* of the white®® poppy is pounded, and is %0a%3c taken in wine as a soporific; the seed of it is a cure, also, for %0a%3c elephantiasis. The black®® poppy acts as a soporific, by the %0a%3c juice which exudes from incisions®* made in the stalk—at the %0a%3c time when the plant is beginning to flower, Diagoras says; %0a%3c but when the blossom has gone off, according to lollas. This %0a%3c is done at the third®® hour, in a clear, still, day, or, in other %0a%3c words, when the dew has thoroughly dried upon the poppy. It %0a%3c is recommended to make the incision just beneath the head %0a%3c %0a%3c See B. xii. c. 56, and B. xix. c. 52. Some writers have supposed, %0a%3c but apparently without any sufficient authority, that this is the Ferula com¬ %0a%3c munis of Linnajus. Fee is of opinion that one of the Umbelliferee is meant. %0a%3c %0a%3c ** In B. xix. c. 53. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is probable. Fee says, that Pliny does not intend here to speak of %0a%3c the calyx as understood by modern botanists, but the corolla of the plant. %0a%3c The calyx disappears immediately after the plant has blossomed ; and is %0a%3c never employed by medical men at the present day, who confine themselves %0a%3c to the heads or cajjsules. %0a%3c %0a%3c “ The variety Album of the Papaver somniferum.

Ihis juice, like that %0a%3c of any other plant, is received in wool or else, if it is in %0a%3c very minute quantities, it is scraped off with the thumb nail %0a%3c just as it is from the lettuce, and so again on the following %0a%3c day, with the portion that has since dried there. If obtained %0a%3c from the peppy in sufficiently large quantities, this juice %0a%3c thickens, after which it is kneaded out into lozenges, and dried %0a%3c in the shade. This juice is possessed not only of certain sopo¬ %0a%3c rific qualities, but, if taken in too large quantities, is productive %0a%3c of sleep unto death even : the name given to it is “ opium.”“ %0a%3c It was in this way, we learn, that the father of P. Licinius %0a%3c Ccscina, a man of Praetorian rank, put an end to his life at %0a%3c Eavilum®* in Spain, an incurable malady having rendered %0a%3c existence quite intolerable to him. Many other persons, too, %0a%3c have ended their lives in a similar way. It is for this reason %0a%3c that opium has been so strongly exclaimed against by Dia- %0a%3c goras and Erasistratus; for they have altogether condemned %0a%3c it as a deadly poison, forbidding it to be used for infusions %0a%3c even, as being injurious to the sight. Andreas says, in addi¬ %0a%3c tion to this, that the only reason why it does not cause instan¬ %0a%3c taneous blindness, is the fact that they adulterate it at Alex¬ %0a%3c andria. In later times, however, the use of it has not been %0a%3c disapproved of—witness the celebrated preparation known as %0a%3c “ diacodion.”®* Lozenges are also made of ground poppy¬ %0a%3c seed, which are taken in milk as a soporific.®® The seed is %0a%3c employed, too, with rose-oil for head-ache ; and, in combination %0a%3c with that oil, is injected into the ears for ear-ache. Mixed %0a%3c with woman’s milk, this seed is used as a liniment for %0a%3c gout: the leaves, too, are employed in a similar manner. %0a%3c Taken in vinegar, the seed is prescribed as a cure for erysipelas %0a%3c and wounds. %0a%3c %0a%3c For my own part, however, I do not approve of opium %0a%3c %0a%3c This plan, Fee thinks, would not be attended with advantage. %0a%3c %0a%3c A name, probably, of Eastern origin, and now universally employed. %0a%3c %0a%3c ®' “ Bilbilis” bas been suggested. %0a%3c %0a%3c _ Syrop of white poppies was, till recently, known as sirop of diaco- %0a%3c dium.

This discovery, however, was only made in the latter part of the %0a%3c last century, by the French chemist, Kosier. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 76.] THE WHITE AND BLACK POPPY. 2/7 %0a%3c %0a%3c entering into the composition of eye-salves,“ and still less of %0a%3c the preparations from it known as febrifuges,*® digestives, and %0a%3c coeliacs: the black poppy, however, is very generally pre¬ %0a%3c scribed, in wine, for coeliac affections. All the cultivated®* %0a%3c poppies are larger than the others, and the form of the head %0a%3c is round. In the wild poppy the head is elongated and small, %0a%3c but it is possessed of more active®'' properties than the others in %0a%3c every respect. This liead is often boiled, and the decoction ot %0a%3c it taken to promote sleep, the face being fomented also with %0a%3c the water. The best poppies are grown in dry localities, and %0a%3c where it seldom rains. %0a%3c %0a%3c When the heads and leaves of the poppy are boiled together, %0a%3c the name given to the decoction is “ meconium ;”** it is much %0a%3c less powerful, however, in its effects than opium. %0a%3c %0a%3c The principal test*® of the purity of opium is the smell, %0a%3c which, when genuine, is so penetrating as to he quite insup¬ %0a%3c portable. The next best test is that obtained by lighting it at %0a%3c a lamp ; upon which it ought to burn with a clear, brilliant %0a%3c flame, and to give out a strong odour Avhen extinguished; a %0a%3c thing that never happens when opium has been drugged, for, %0a%3c in such case, it lights with the greatest difficulty, and the %0a%3c flame repeatedly goes out. There is another way of testing %0a%3c its genuineness, by water ; for, if it is pure, it will float like a %0a%3c thin cloud upon the surface, but, if adulterated, it will unite in %0a%3c the form of blisters on the water. But the most surprising %0a%3c thing of all is the fact, that the sun’s heat in summer furnishes %0a%3c a test; for, if the drug is pure, it will sweat and gradually %0a%3c melt, till it has all the appearance of the juice when fresh %0a%3c gathered. %0a%3c %0a%3c Mnesides is of opinion that the best way of preserving %0a%3c opium is to mix henbane seed with it; others, again, recom¬ %0a%3c mend that it should be kept with beans. %0a%3c %0a%3c ®‘ “ Colljriis.” %0a%3c %0a%3c ®® “ Lexipyretos,” “pepticas,” and “ coeliacas”—Greek appellations. %0a%3c %0a%3c ®« The type of the cultivated poppy is the Papaver somniferum of %0a%3c Linnseiis. %0a%3c %0a%3c *’ This, Fee says, is a matter of doubt. %0a%3c %0a%3c ** From fir)Kwv, a “ poppy.” Tournefort has described this kind of %0a%3c opium obtained by decoction ; it is held in little esteem. %0a%3c %0a%3c Fee remarks, that this account of the tests of opium is correct in the %0a%3c extreme. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 278 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Flint’s natueal history. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XX. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 77 .

The root, boiled down to one half, in doses of one %0a%3c acetabulum to two sextarii of water, is prescribed for maladies %0a%3c of the loins and liver, and the leaves, employed with honey, %0a%3c are a cure for carbuncles. %0a%3c %0a%3c Some persons give this kind of poppy the name of “ glau- %0a%3c cion,” and others of “ paralium,”™ for it grows, in fact, in %0a%3c spots exposed to exhalations from the sea, or else in soils of a %0a%3c nitrous nature. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 79 , -THE WILD POPPY CALLED HERACLIUM, OR APHRON : %0a%3c %0a%3c FOUR REMEDIES.

Plant. B. ix. c. .31, compares this plant with the %0a%3c Struthium — (see B. xix. c. 18). Pliny, or bis scribes, have supposed him %0a%3c t(j be speaking of the arpovOos, or “ sparrow”—hence the present mistake. %0a%3c The Struthium itself has received that name from the resemblance which %0a%3c its flower bears to a bird with the wings expanded. %0a%3c %0a%3c ” Hence its name, “aphron.” %0a%3c %0a%3c See B. xix. c. 4. Pliny bas here mistaken a passage of Theophrastus, %0a%3c Hist. Plant. B. ix. c. 31 ; where he attributes this quality to the Struthium, %0a%3c and not the Heraclium. %0a%3c %0a%3c ” See c. 76 of this Book.

It neutralizes the effects, %0a%3c it is said, of poisoned arrows, and the venom of the serpents %0a%3c known as haemorrhois and prestertaken with the food and %0a%3c applied to the wound, it extracts the poison. The juice, too, %0a%3c they say, taken in raisin wine, is an antidote for henbane. %0a%3c When the plant itself cannot be procured, the seed of it is %0a%3c found to be equally efficacious. It is a corrective, also, of im¬ %0a%3c purities in water ; and beaten up in wine and applied topically, %0a%3c it is a cure for head-ache and ulcers of the head. Chewed in %0a%3c combination with honey, it is curative of other kinds of sores. %0a%3c It is similarly applied to the region of the brain in infants, and %0a%3c in cases of umbilical hernia; as also for defluxions of the eyes, %0a%3c in persons of all ages, being applied to the forehead and'tem- %0a%3c ples with polenta.

A leaf of mallow put upon %0a%3c a scorpion, will strike it with torpor. %0a%3c %0a%3c The mallow is an antidote, also, against the poisonous effects %0a%3c of white ’ lead; and applied raw with saltpetre, it extracts %0a%3c all kinds of pointed bodies from the flesh.

With the root of the mallow which has a single stem,“ %0a%3c it is a good plan to prick the parts about a tooth when it aches, %0a%3c until the pain has ceased. With the addition of human saliva, %0a%3c the mallow cleanses scrofulous sores, imposthumes of the parotid %0a%3c glands, and inflammatory tumours, without producing a wound. %0a%3c The seed of it, taken in red wine, disperses phlegm and relieves %0a%3c nausea ; and the root, attached to the person with black wool, %0a%3c is a remedy for affections of the mamillae. Boiled in milk, and %0a%3c taken as a pottage, it cures a cough within five days. %0a%3c %0a%3c Scxtius Niger says that mallows are prejudicial to the sto¬ %0a%3c mach, and Olympias, the Theban authoress, asserts that, em¬ %0a%3c ployed with goose-grease, they are productive of abortion. %0a%3c Some persons are of opinion, that a good handful of the leaves, %0a%3c taken in oil and wine, promotes the menstrual discharge.

Of %0a%3c wild thistles there are two varieties; one®^ of which throws %0a%3c out numerous stalks immediately it leaves the ground, the %0a%3c other®® being thicker, and having but a single stem. They %0a%3c have, both of them, a few leaves only, and covered with %0a%3c prickles, the head of the plant being protected by thorny %0a%3c points : the last mentioned, however, puts forth in the middle %0a%3c of these points a purple blossom, which turns white with %0a%3c great rapidity, and is carried off by the wind; the Greeks %0a%3c give it the name of “ scolymos.” %0a%3c %0a%3c This plant, gathered before it blossoms, and beaten up and %0a%3c subjected to pressure, produces a juice, which, applied to the %0a%3c head, makes the hair grow again when it has fallen off through %0a%3c alopecy. The root of either kind, boiled in water, creates %0a%3c thirst, it is said, in those who drink it. It strengthens the %0a%3c stomach also, and if we are to believe w^hat is said, has some %0a%3c influence upon the womb in promoting the conception of male %0a%3c offspring: at all events, Glaucias, who seems to have paid %0a%3c the most attention to the subject, has written to that eftect.y %0a%3c The thin juice, like mastich, which exudes from these planW^ %0a%3c imparts sweetness to the breath.

Others, again, think that the work “ on the Cabbage,” mentioned- %0a%3c by Pliny in c. 33, was written by another Chrysippus, a pupil of Erasis- %0a%3c tratus, in the tliird century n.c. %0a%3c %0a%3c A native of Carystus, in Euboea, who lived in the fourth century n.c. %0a%3c He belonged to the medical sect of the Dogmatici, and wrote several medi¬ %0a%3c cal works, of which the titles only and a few fragments remain. %0a%3c %0a%3c ** Of this writer nothing whatever is known. %0a%3c %0a%3c P’or Heraclides of Heraclea, see end of B. xii.; for Heraclides of %0a%3c Pontus, see end of B. iv.; and for Heraclides of Tarentum, see end of B. %0a%3c xii. They were all physicians. %0a%3c %0a%3c See end of B. xv. ggg end of B. xii. %0a%3c %0a%3c It was probably this personage, or the one next mentioned, who wrote %0a%3c to Ptolemy, one of the kings of Egypt, giving him directions as to what %0a%3c Aviiies he should drink. See B. xiv. c. 9. A person of this name wrote a %0a%3c work on Ointments and Chaplets, quuted by Athenmus, and another on %0a%3c Venomous Animals, quoted by the same author. This last is probably the %0a%3c work referred to by Pliny, B. xxi. cc. 16, 29, &c. It bas been suggested %0a%3c also, that the proper reading here is “ Apollonius” of Citium, a pupil of %0a%3c Zopyrus, a physician of Alexandria. %0a%3c %0a%3c See the preceding Note. %0a%3c %0a%3c A celebrated physician, a native of the island of Cos. He belonged %0a%3c to the medical sect of the Dogmatici, and flourished probably in the fourth %0a%3c century n.c. He was more particularly celebrated for his comparatively %0a%3c accurate knowledge of anatomy.

Galen speaks of him as being held in %0a%3c great repute among the Greeks. %0a%3c %0a%3c He flourislied in the fourth century b.c., and belonged to the medi¬ %0a%3c cal sect of the Dogmatici. He wrote some medical works, of which no¬ %0a%3c thing but a few fragments remain. %0a%3c %0a%3c He lived probably about the beginning of the third century b.c., as %0a%3c he was the tutor of Antigenes and Miiemon. He seems to have been %0a%3c famous for his medicinal prescriptions of wine, and the quantities of cold %0a%3c water which he gave to his patients. %0a%3c %0a%3c Born either in Sicily or at Locri Epizephyrii, in Italy. He is sup¬ %0a%3c posed to have lived in the fourth century b.c. By some persons he was %0a%3c thought to have been one of the founders of the sect of the Empirici. He %0a%3c wrote works on Materia Medica and Cookery, and is several times quoted %0a%3c by Pliny and Galen.

Dioscorides and Saint Epiphanius speak' of Petronius and Eio- %0a%3c dotus, making them different persons; and it is not improbable that the %0a%3c true reading in c. 32 of this Book, is “ Petronius et Diodotus.” %0a%3c %0a%3c See end of B. xii. 34 ggg emj (,f ^i. %0a%3c %0a%3c 33 See end of B. xii. %0a%3c %0a%3c *3 It is probable that there were several Greek physicians of this name; %0a%3c but the only one of whom anything certain is known is the physician to %0a%3c Ptolemy Philopater, king of Egypt, in whose tent he was killed by Theo- %0a%3c dotus, the AUtolian, b.c. 217.

It has been %0a%3c suggested that the botanical writer was a different personage, the brother %0a%3c of the Comic poet Demologus. %0a%3c %0a%3c 39 Possibly the same person as the Damon mentioned at the end of B. %0a%3c vii.

He wrote some pharmaceutical works, and is censured by Galen %0a%3c for his disgusting remedies, such as human brains, flesh, urine, liver, ex¬ %0a%3c crements, &c. There is a short essay by him still in existence, on the %0a%3c Aliments derived from the Aquatic Animals. %0a
