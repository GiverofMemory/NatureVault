Possibly it is distilled or separated first.%0a%0aTake the weight of dry clay to activate and add 40%25 sulfuric acid in volume.  So if you are using 100g of dry clay, add 40mL of sulfuric acid for best results [[https://youtu.be/jQNEvYjJliU|#]].  When the clay is properly activated it should be very white probably from the removal of iron.  Even non-activated clay achieves some results.  Best results are probably found using the method above where a little sulfuric acid (and hcl) is added to the oil and heated before adding the activated clay.%0a%0a[[Diatomaceous earth]] is a filter while activated clay is a cleaner of oils [[https://sciencing.com/uses-gypsum-powder-6395376.html|#]]%0a%0aAmount to add to oil is 0.3-1%25 weight of bleaching clay to oil weight [[https://youtu.be/nBEZQtgAzGY|#]]  for waste motor oil may need to be up to 10%25 (so 100g in 1 L of oil) and extra bit of acid added and stirred and heated before clay, each tablespoon should weigh about 13-15g [[https://www.humblebeeandme.com/the-clay-experiments-the-heavy-clays/|#]]%0a%0aBleaching conditions 90-110c stirring for 30 mins [[https://youtu.be/nBEZQtgAzGY|#]]%0a%0a!!!Protocol attempt%0a%0a#Dry at 90-100c for several hours until all bubbles stop (signifies all water is gone)%0a%0a#Centrifuge 3000g-4000g for 10 mins (if less G do it for longer time, say 30 mins for 2500g) to get out any metal filings%0a%0a#Cook with 1%25 [[sulfuric acid]] or [[phosphoric acid]] 150c-180c; will bubble and offgas, do outdoors or in a really good fume hood%0a%0a#Cook with 10%25 activated clay to oil w:v 30+ mins heated, stirring%0a%0a#Let sit and cool 8-12+ hours%0a%0a#Add 2%25 w:w diatomceous earth, stir for 5 mins%0a%0a#let sit 1 hr%0a%0a#filter or centrifuge%0a%0a#See if it tarnishes copper, if so need to neutralize with baking soda.
