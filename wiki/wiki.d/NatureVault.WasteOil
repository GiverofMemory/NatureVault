csum=Take the weight of dry clay to activate and add 40%25 sulfuric acid in volume.  So if you are using 100g of dry clay, add 40mL of sulfuric acid for best results [[https://youtu.be/jQNEvYjJliU|#]].  When the clay is properly activated it should be very white probably from the removal of iron.  Even non-activated clay achieves some results.  Best results are probably found using the method above where a little sulfuric acid (and hcl) is added to the oil and heated before adding the activated clay.  [[Diatomaceous earth]] is a filter while activated clay is a cleaner of oils [[https://sciencing.com/uses-gypsum-powder-6395376.html|#]]
