ITS MODE OF %0a%0aFUUCTIFICATIOX. %0a%0aThose which have been hitherto mentioned, are, ncarlj' all %0aof thera, exotic trees, wliich it is impossible to rear in any %0aother than their native soil, and which are not to be naturalized %0ain strange countries.' It is now for us to. speak of the more %0aordinary kinds, of all of which Italy may be looked upon %0aas more particularly the parent.^ Those who are well ac- %0aquainted with the subject, must only bear in mind that for %0athe present we content ourselves with merely stating the %0adifferent varieties of these trees, and not the mode of cultivating %0athem, although there is no doubt that the characteristics of a %0atree depend very considerably upon its cultivation. At this %0afact I cannot sufficiently express my astonishment, that of %0asome trees all memorj' has utterly perished, and that the %0avery names of some, of which we find various authors making %0amention, have wholly disappeared.^ And yet w^ho does not %0areadily admit that now, when intercommunications have been %0aopened between all parts of the world, thanks to the majestic %0asway of the lloman empire, civilization and the arts of life %0ahave made a rapid progress, owing to the interchange of com- %0amodities and the common enjoyment by all of the blessings of %0apeace, while at the same time a multitude of objects which %0a%0a^ This must be understood -with considerable modification — many -of %0athe tropical trees and plants have been naturalized, and those of America %0amore particularly, in Europe. %0a%0a2 He is probably wrong in looking upon the vine as indigenous to Italy. %0aIt was known in very early times in Egypt and Greece, and it is now %0agenerally considered that it is indigenous throughout the tract that %0astretches to tlie south, from the the mountains of Mazandiran on the Cas- %0apian to the sliorcs of the Persian Gulf and the Indian Sea, and eastward %0athrough Khorassan and Cabul to the base of the Himalayas. %0a%0a3 The art of printing, Fee remarks, utterly precludes the recurrence of %0asuch a fact as tlijs. %0a%0a%0a%0a216 %0a%0a%0a%0aplint's natueal history.

It %0ais a thousand years ago since Hesiod,' at the very dawn, so to %0asay, of literature, first gave precepts for the guidance of the %0aagriculturist, an example which has since been followed by no %0asmall number of writers. Hence have originated considerable %0alabours for ourselves, seeing that we have not only to enquire %0ainto the discoveries of modem times, but to ascertain as well %0awhat was known to the ancients, and this, too, in the verj- %0amidst of that oblivion which the heedlessness of the present %0aday has so greatly tended to generate. \Yhat causes then are %0awe to assign for this lethargy, other than those feelings which %0awe find actuating the public in general throughout all the %0aworld ? New manners and usages, no doubt, have now como %0ainto vogue, and the minds of men arc occupied with subjects %0aof a totally different nature ; the arts of avarice, in fact, are %0athe only ones that are now cultivated. %0a%0aIn days gone by, the sway and the destinies of states were %0abounded by their own narrow limits, and consequently the %0agenius of the people was similarly circumscribed as well, %0athrough a sort of niggardliness that was thus displayed by %0aFortune : hence it became with them a matter of absolute %0anecessity to employ the advantages of the understanding : %0akings innumerable received the homage of the arts, and in %0amaking a display of the extent of their resources, gave the %0ahighest rank to those arts, entertaining the opinion that it was %0athrough, them that they should ensure immortality. Hence it %0awas that due rewards, and the various works of civilization, were %0adisplayed in such vast abundance in those times. For these %0alater ages, the enlarged boundaries of the habitable world, %0aand the vast extent of our empire, have been a positive injury. %0aSince the Censor has been chosen for the extent of his property, %0asince the judge has been selected according to the magnitude of %0ahis fortune, since it has become the fashion to consider that %0a%0a* In allusion to his poem, the " "Works and Days," the prototype of %0aVirgil's Georgics. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 2.] %0a%0a%0a%0aTHE >'ATUUE OP THE TINE. %0a%0a%0a%0a217 %0a%0a%0a%0anothing reflects a higher merit upon the magistrate and the %0ageneral than a large estate, since the being destitute of heirs' %0ahas begun to confer upon persons the very highest power and %0ainfluence, since legacy-hunting^ has become the most lucrative %0aof all professions, and since it has been considered tliat the %0aonly real pleasures are those of possessing, all the true enjoy- %0aments of life have been utterly lost sight of, and all those arts %0awhich have derived the name of liberal, from liberty,^ that %0agreatest blessing of life, have come to deserve the contrary %0aappellation, servility alone being the passport to profit. %0a%0aThis servility each one has his own peculiar way of making %0amost agreeable, and of putting in practice in reference to %0aothers, the motives and the hopes of all tending to the one %0agreat object, the acquisition of wealth : indeed, we may every- %0awhere behold men even of naturally excellent qualities pre- %0aferring to foster the vicious inclinations of others rather than %0acultivate tlieir own talents. We may therefore conclude, by %0aHercules ! that pleasure has now begun to live, and that life, %0atruly 80 called, has ceased to be.® As to ourselves, however, %0awe shall continue our researches into matters now lost in ob- %0alivion, nor shall we be deterred from pursuing our task by the %0atrivial nature^ of some of our details, a consideration which %0ahas in no way influenced us in our description of the animal %0aworld. And yet we find that Virgil, that most admirable %0apoet, has allowed this to influence him, in his omission to enlarge %0aupon the beauties of the garden ; for, happy and graceful poet %0aas he is, he has only culled what we may call the flower of %0ahis subject: indeed, we find that he has only named'" in all %0asome fifteen varieties of the grape, three of the olive, the same %0anumber of the pear, and the citron of Assyria, and has passed %0aover the rest in silence altogether, %0a%0a(2).

In the city of Popu- %0alonium, we see a statue of Jupiter formed of the trunk of a %0asingle vino, which, has for ages remained proof against all %0adecay ; and at Massilia, there is a patera made of the same %0awood. At Metapontum, the temple of Juno has long stood %0asupported by pillars formed of the like material ; and even at %0athe present day we ascend to the roof of the temple of Diana at %0aEphesus, by stairs constructed, it is said, of the trunk of a single %0avine, that was brought from Cj^prus ; the vines of that island %0aoften attaining a most remarkable size. There is not a wood in %0aexistence of a more lasting nature than this ; I am strongly %0ainclined, however, to be of opinion that the material of which %0athese various ai'ticles were constructed was the wild Anne. %0a%0aCHAP. 3. THE NATUEE OF THE GRAPE, AND THE CULTIVATION OP %0a%0aTHE VINE. %0a%0aThe cultivated vine is kept down by pruning every year, %0aand all the strength of the tree is drawn as much as possible %0ainto the shoots, or else thrown downwards to the sets indeed, %0ait is only allowed to expand with the view of ensuring an %0aabundant supply of juice, a result which is obtained in various %0amodes according to the peculiarities of the climate and the %0anature of the soil. In Campania they attach'''' the vine to the %0apoplar : embracing the tree to which it is thus wedded, the %0avine grasps the branches with its amorous arms, and as it %0aclimbs, holds on with its knotted trunk, till it has reached the %0avery summit ; the height being sometimes so stupendous that %0athe vintager when hired is wont to stipulate for his funeral %0apile and a grave at the owner's expense. The vine keeps %0a%0a" Theophrastus reckons it among the trees ; Columella, B. ii., considers %0ait to occupy a middle position between a tree and a shrub. Horace, 13. i. %0aOde 18, calls it a tree, "arbor.' %0a%0a^■^ Or "layers," " propagines." %0a%0a'3 Nubunt, properly " marry." This is still done in Naples, and other %0aports of Italy. The use of vine stays there are unknown. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 3.] %0a%0a%0a%0aTHE CULTIVATION OF THE VINK, %0a%0a%0a%0a21.0 %0a%0a%0a%0acontinually on the increase, and it is quite impossible to sepa- %0arate the two, or rather, I may say, to tear them asunder. %0aValerianus Cornelius has regarded it as one of the most re- %0amarkable facts that could be transmitted to posterity, that %0asingle vines have been known to surround villas and country- %0ahouses with their shoots and creeping tendrils ever on the %0astretch. At Eome, in the porticoes of Livia, a single vine, %0awith its leaf- clad trellises, protects with its shade the walks %0ain the open air; the fruit of it yields twelve amphorae of %0amust.'* %0a%0aEverywhere we find the vine overtopping the elm even, %0aand we read that Cineas,'** the ambassador of King Pyrrhus, %0awhen admiring the great height of the vines at Arici;!, %0awittily making allusion to the peculiar rough taste of wine, %0aremarked that it was with very good reason that they had %0ahung the parent of it on so lofty a gibbet. There is a tree %0ain that part of Italy which lies beyond the Padus," known %0aas the " rumpotinus," or sometimes by the name of "opu- %0alus," the broad circular'^ storeys of which are covered with %0avines, whose branches wind upwards in a serpentine form to %0athe part where the boughs finally divide," and then, throw- %0aing out their tendrils, disperse them in every direction among %0athe straight and finger-like twigs which project from the %0abranches. There are vines also, about as tall as a man of %0amoderate height, which are supported by props, and, as they %0athrow out their bristling tendrils, form whole vineyards : while %0aothers, again, in their inordinate love for climbing, combined %0awith skill on the part of the proprietor, will cover even the %0avery centre'® of the court-yard with their shoots and foliage. %0a%0a'* "Mustum." Pure, unfermented juice of the grape. %0a%0aSee B. vii. c. 24. Italia Transpadana. %0a%0aSee B. xxiv. c. 112. The Bauhins are of opinion that this is the %0aAcer opulus of Willdenow, common in Italy, and very branchy. %0a%0a"Tabulata in orbem patula." He probably alludes to the branches %0aextending horizontally from the trunk. %0a" " lu palniam ejus." %0a%0aThere is no doubt that the whole of this passage is in a most cor- %0arupt state, and we can only guess at its meaning. Sillig suggests a new %0areading, which, unsupported as it is by any of the MSS., can only be %0aregarded as fanciful, and perhaps as a very slight improvement on tlie %0aattempts to obtain a solution of the difficulty. Pliny's main object seems %0ato be to contrast the vines that entwine round poles and_ rise perpendicu- %0alarly with those that creep horizontally. %0a%0a%0a%0a220 %0a%0a%0a%0aFlint's natuba-L iiisxonr. %0a%0a%0a%0a[Book XIV. %0a%0a%0a%0aSo numerous are the varieties of the vine which even Italy %0aalone presents. %0a%0aIn some of the provinces the vine is able to stand of itself %0awithout anything to support it, drawing in its bending %0abranches, and making up in its thickness for its stunted size. %0aIn other places, again, the winds will not allow of this mode of %0aculture, as in Africa, for instance, and various parts of the %0aprovince of Gallia Narbonensis. These vines, being prevented %0afrom growing beyond the first branches, and hence always %0aretaining a resemblance to those plants which stand in need %0aof the hoe, traU along the ground just like them, and every %0ahere and there suck^® up the juices from the earth to fill their %0agrapes : it is in consequence of this, that in the interior of Africa %0athe clusters^ are knowTi to exceed the body of an infant in size. %0aThe wine of no country' is more acid than those of Africa, but %0athere is nowhere to be found a grape that is more agreeable %0afor its firmness, a circumstance which may very probably have %0agiven rise to its name of the "hard grape."^' As to the %0avarieties of the grape, although they are rendered innumerable %0aby the size, the colour, and the flavour of the berry, they are %0amultiplied even still more by the wines that they produce. %0aIn one part they are lustrous with a rich piu-ple colour, while %0ain another, again, they glow with a rosy tint, or else are glossy %0awith their verdant hue. The grapes that are merely white %0aor black are the common sorts. The bumastus" swells out %0ain form like a breast, while that known as the " dactylus," ^' %0ahas a berry of remarkable length. Nature, too, displays such %0avarieties in these productions of hers, that small grapes are %0aoften to be found adhering to the largest vines, but of sur- %0apassing sweetness ; they are known by the name of " lep- %0atorragae."'^ Some, again, will keep throughout the winter, if %0acare is taken to hang them to the ceUing^ with a string ; %0a%0a" By throwing out fresli shoots every here and there. Fee, however, %0aseems to think that he means that the grapes themselves, as tlicy trail %0aalong the ground, suck up the juices with tlieir pores. These arc known %0ain France as "running vines," and are found in ikrry and Anjou. %0a%0aHe must e\'idently be speaking of the size of the bunches. See the %0aaccount of the grapes of Canaan, in Numbers xiii. 24. %0a%0a" Durus acinus," or, according to some readings, " duracinus." %0aFrom the Greek jSon/iaoToe, a cow's teat, mentioned by Virgil, Georo". %0a%0a102. 23 Qi- finger-grape. %0a%0a^ From the Greek XtTrropayes, " small-berned." %0a%0a^ Pensili conca-naratas nodo. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 3 ] THE CULTIVATION OF THE TINE. 221 %0a%0awhile others, again, will keep by virtue of their own natural %0afreshness and vigour, if put into earthen jars, which are then %0aenclosed in dolia,-« and covered up with the fermenting husks %0aof grapes. Some grapes receive from the smoke of the black- %0asmith's forge that remarkable flavour which it is also known %0ato impart to wines : it was the high name of the Emperor %0aTiberius that brought into such great repute the grapes that %0ahad been smoked in the smithies of Africa. Before his time %0athe highest rank at table was assigned to the grapes of Rhie- %0atia,*' and to those growing in the territory of Verona. %0a%0aRaisins of the sun have the name of "passi," from having %0abeen submitted-^ to the influence of the sun. It is not un- %0acommon to preserve grapes in must, and so make them drunk %0awith their own juices; while there are some that are all the %0asweeter for being placed in must after it has been boiled ; %0aothers, again, are left to hang on the parent tree till a new %0acrop has made its appearance, by which time they have be- %0acome as clear and as transparent^' as glass. Astringent %0apitch, if poured upon the footstalk of the grape, will impart %0ato it all that body and that firmness which, when placed iu %0adolia or amphorte, it gives to wine. More recently, too, there %0ahas been discovered a vine which produces a fruit that imparts %0ato its wine a strong flavour of pitch : it is the famous grape %0athat confers such celebrity on the territory of Vienne,^° and of %0awhich several varieties have recently enriched the territories %0aof the Arverni, the Sequani, and the Helvii : it was un- %0aknown in the time of the poet Virgil, who has now been dead %0athese ninety years.'- %0a%0aIn addition to these particulars, need I make mention of the %0afact that the vinc^^ has been introduced into the camp and %0a%0a2" We have no corresponding; word for the Latin " dolium." It was %0aan oblong earthen vessel, used for much the same purpose as our vats ; %0anew wine was generalljf placed in it. In times later than that of Pliny %0athe dolia were made ot wood. %0a%0aHardouin speaks of these grapes as still growing in his time in the %0aValtcUine, and remarkable for their excellence. %0a%0a38 " ^ patientia."

Among the medicinal pre- %0aparations, too, the vine holds so higli a place, that its very %0aAvines taken by themselves are efficacious as remedies for %0adisease.^' %0a%0aCHAP. 4. (2.) — NINETY-ONE VAEIETIES OF THE VINE. %0a%0aDemocritus, who has declared that he was acquainted with %0aevery variety of the grape knoNvoi in Greece, is the only person %0awho has been of opinion that every kind could be enumerated ; %0abut, on the other hand, the rest of the authors have stated that %0athey are quite innumerable^* and of infinite extent, an assertion %0athe truth of which will be more evident, if we only consider %0athe vast number of wines. I shall not attempt, then, to speak %0aof every kind of vine, but only of those that are the most re- %0amarkable, seeing that the varieties are very nearly as number- %0aless as the districts in which they grow. It will suffice, then, %0ato point out those which are the most remarkable among the %0avines, or else are peculiar for some wonderful property. %0a%0aThe very highest rank is given to the Aminean*' grape, on %0a%0aThe reading " elatas," has been ndopted. If "lentas" is retained, %0ait may mean, " promotion, slow though it be," for the word " aquila" %0awas often used to denote the rank of the " primipilus," who had the %0acharge of tlie eagle of the legion. %0a%0a^= Because it was the privilege solely of those soldiers who were Roman %0acitizens to be beaten witli the vine sapling. %0a%0a35 He alludes to the " vinea" used in besieging towns ; the first notion %0aof which was derived from the leafy roof afforded by the vines when creeping %0aon the trellis over-head. It was a moveable machine, affording a roof %0aunder which the besiegers protected themselves against darts, stones, fire, %0aand other missiles. Raw hides or wet cloths constituted the uppermost %0alayer. %0a%0a37 See B. xxiii. c. 19. %0a%0a'8 Many years ago, tliere were in the gardens of the Luxembourg one %0athousand four hundred varieties of the French grape, and even then there %0awere many not to be found there; while, at the same time, it was con- %0asidered that the French kinds did not form more than one-twentieth part %0aof the species known in Europe. %0a%0aThis vine was said to be of Grecian origin, and to have been con- %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 4.] %0a%0a%0a%0aVAUIETIES OF THE YINE. %0a%0a%0a%0a223 %0a%0a%0a%0aaccount of the body and durability of its wine, which, improves %0avrith old age. There are five varieties of the Aminean grape ; %0aof these, the smaller germana, or " sister" grape, has a smaller %0ab(Try than the rest, and flowers more strongly, being able to %0abear up against rain and tempestuous weather ; a thing that %0ais not the case with the larger germana, though it is less ex- %0aposed to danger when attached to a tree than when supported %0aonly by a trellis. Another kind, again, has obtained the %0aname of the " gcmella," or " twin" grape, because the clusters %0aalways grow*" in couples : the flavour of the wine is extremely %0arough, but it is remarkable for its strength. Of these several %0avarieties the smaller one suff'ers from the south wind, but re- %0aceives nutriment from all the others, upon Mount Vesuvius, %0afor instance, and the hills of Surrentum : in the other parts of %0aItaly it is never grown except attached to trees. The fifth %0akind is that known as the lanata, or "woolly" grape; so that %0awe need not be surprised at the wool-bearing trees'*^ of the %0aSeres or the Indians, for this grape is covered with a woolly %0adown of remarkable thickness. It is the first of the Ami- %0anean vines that ripens, but the grape decays with remarkable %0arapidity. %0a%0aThe second rank belongs to the vines of Momentum,"* the %0awood of which is red, from which circumstance the vines have %0areceived from some the name of " rubeUa?." The grapes of %0athis vine produce less wine than usual, in consequence of the %0aextraordinary quantity of husk and lees they throw ofi" : but %0athe vine is remarkably strong, is well able to stand the frost, %0aand is apt to receive more detriment from drought than from %0arain, from heat than from cold ; hpncc it is that those are %0alooked upon as the best that are grown in cold and moist %0alocalities. That variety which has the smallest grape is con- %0a%0av(!ycd by a Thcssalian tribe to Italy, where it was grown at Aminea, a %0avillage m the Falcrnian district of Campania. It is supposed to have %0abeen°the same as the ffros plant of the Frtiich. The varieties mentioned %0aby Pliny seem not to have been recognized by the moderns. %0ai» Fee docs not give credit to this statement. %0a%0a*i In allusion to the cotton-trec, or else the mulberry leaves covered %0awith the cocoons of the silkworm. See B. vi. c. 20, and B. xii. c. 21. %0aVirgil, in the Georgics, has the well-known line : %0a%0a" Vclleraque ut foliis depectant tcnuia Seres." %0aSec B. iii. c. 9. There are many vines, the wood of which is red, %0abut this species has not been identified. %0a%0a%0a%0a224 %0a%0a%0a%0aplint'3 natueal history. %0a%0a%0a%0arnook XIV. %0a%0a%0a%0asidered the most fruitful : the one which has a jagged leaf is %0aless productive. %0a%0aThe vine known as the " apiana,"" has received that name %0afrom the bee, an insect which is remarkably fond of it : there %0aare two varieties of this vine. This grape, too, is covered in %0aits young state with a kind of down ; the main diiForence be- %0atween the two varieties is, that the one ripens more rapidly %0athan the other, though this last ripens with considerable %0aquickness. A cold locality is not at all hurtful to them, %0aalthough there is no grape that ripens sooner : these grapes, %0ahowever, very soon rot in the rain. The wines produced by %0athis grape are sweet at fii'st, but contract a rough flavour in %0athe course of years. This vine is cultivated more than any %0aother in Etruria. Thus far we have made mention of the %0amore celebrated vines among those which are peculiar and in- %0adigenous to Italy ; the rest have been introduced from Chios %0aor Thasos. %0a%0aThe small Greek" grape is not inferior to the Aminean for %0athe excellence of its quality : the berry is remarkably thin- %0askinned, and the cluster so extremely small, that it is not %0aworth while cultivating it, except on a soil of remarkable %0arichness. The eugenia,^" so called from its high qualities, has %0abeen introduced into the Alban territory from the hills of %0aTauromenium it is found, however, to thrive only there, %0afor if transplanted elsewhere it degenerates immediately : in %0afact, there is in some vines so strong an attachment to their %0anative soil, that they leave behind them all their high repute, %0aand are never transplanted in their full entirety. This is the %0acase, too, with the Ehaetian and the Allobrogian grapes, of %0aAvhich we have made mention above as the pitch-flavoured^" %0agrape; these are justly deemed excellent in their own coun- %0a%0a" From " apis," a " bee."

Still, %0aliowever, in consequence of their remarkable fertility, they %0amake up for quality by abundance : the eugenia thrives in %0aspots which are scorching hot, the Rhsetian vine in places of a %0amore moderate temperature, and the Allobrogian in cold, ex- %0aposed situations, the fruit being of a black colour, and ripened %0aby the agency of frost. %0a%0aThe wines produced from the vines of which we have %0ahitherto made mention, even though the grapes are black, %0abecome, all of them, when old, of a white " complexion. The %0aother vines are of no note in particular, though sometimes, %0athanks to some peciiliarity either in the climate or the soil, %0athe wines produced from them attain a mature old age ; such, %0afor instance, as the Fecenian*" vine, and the Biturigian,*' which %0ablossoms at the same time with it, but has not so many grapes. %0aThe blossoms of these last-mentioned vines are not liable to %0areceive injury, both because they are naturally but transi- %0atory, and have the power of resisting the action of both wind %0aand storm ; still, however, those that grow in cold spots are %0aconsidered superior to those produced in a warm site, and those %0afound in moist places superior to those grown in dry, thirsty %0alocalities. %0a%0aThe vine known as the "visula" "2 * * * * more %0athan abundance of fruit, being unable to endure the extreme %0avariations of the atmosphere, though it is very well able to %0astand a continuation of either cold or heat. Of this last kind %0athe smaller one is the best, but diflScult to please in its choice ; %0ain a rich earth it is apt to rot, while in a thin soil it will come %0ato nothing at all : in its fastidiousness it requires a soil of %0amiddling quality, and hence it is that it is so commonly found %0aon the hills of the Sabine territory. Its grape is unsightly ;in %0aappearance, but has a very pleasant flavour : if it is not gathered %0aat the very moment that it is ripe, it will fall, even before it %0adecays.

Of the two %0asorts of helvolae, the black is the one generally preferred : they %0aboth of them produce every other year, but the wine is best %0awhen the vintage has been less abundant. %0a%0aThe vine that is known as the " prccia" " is also divided %0ainto two varieties, distinguished by the size of the grape. %0aThese vines produce a vast quantity of wood, and the grape is %0avery good for preserving in jars the leaves are similar in %0aappearance to that of parsley.^® The people of Dyrrhachium %0ahold in high esteem the vine known as the " basilica," the %0asame which in Spain is called the " cocolobis."" The grapes %0aof this vine grow in thin clusters, and it can stand great heat, %0aand the south winds. The wine produced from it is apt to fly %0ato the head the produce of the vine is very large. The %0apeople in Spain distinguish two kinds of this vine, the one %0awith the oblong, the other with the round grape ; they gather %0athis fruit the very last of all. The sweeter the cocolobis is, %0athe more it is valued ; but even if it has a rough taste, the wine %0awill become sweet by keeping, while, on the other hand, that %0awhich was sweet at first, will acquire a certain roughness ; it %0ais in this last state that the wine is thought to rival that of %0aAlba.°' It is said that the juice of this grape is remarkably %0aefficacious when drunk as a specific for diseases of the bladder. %0a%0a''^ By this name it would be understood that they were of an inter- %0amediate colour between rose and white, a not uncommon colour in the %0agrape. Pliny, however, says otherwise, and he is supported by Columella. %0a%0a^ C. Bauhin took this to mean one of the garden currant trees, the %0aRibcs uva crispa of Linnasus, daWed by Bauhin Grossularia simplici acino, %0aor else Spinosa agrestis.

The word cocolab, according to some, meant %0acock's comb. It is mentioned as a Spanish word by Columella. %0a%0a38 Dalechamps says, that a similar wine was made at ilontpellicr, and %0athat it was called " piquardant." %0aSee B. xxiii. cc. 20, 21. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 4.] %0a%0a%0a%0aVAEIETIEg OF THE VIJTE. %0a%0a%0a%0a227 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe " albuelis" ^ produces most of its fruit at the top of %0athe tree, the visula at the bottom ; hence, when planted around %0athe same tree, in consequence of these peculiarities in their %0anature, thej^ bear between them a two-fold crop. One of the %0ablack grape vines has been called the " inerticula," " though %0ait might with more propriety have been styled the " sobria;'"^- %0athe wine from it is remarkably good, and more particularly %0awhen old ; but though strong, it is productive of no ill effects, %0aand, indeed, is the only wine that will not cause in- %0atoxication. %0a%0a^ The abundance of their produce again recommends other %0avines to us, and, in the first place, that known as the " helven- %0anaca."^^ Of this vine there are two kinds ; the larger, which %0ais by some called the "long" helvennaca, and the smaller %0akind, which is known as the " emarcum,"" not so prolific as %0athe first, but producing a wine of more agreeable flavour ; it %0ais distinguished by its rounded leaf, but they are both of %0athem of slender make. It is requisite to place forks beneath %0athese vines for the support of their branches, as otherwise it %0awould be quite impossible for them to support the weight of %0atheir produce : they receive nutriment from the breezes that %0ablow from the sea, and foggy weather is injurious to them. %0aThere is not one among the vines that manifests a greater %0aaversion to Italy, for there it becomes comparatively leafless %0aand stunted, and soon decays, while the wine which it produces %0athere will not keep beyond the summer : no vine, however, %0athrives better in a poor soil. Groecinus, who has copied from %0athe works of Coi-nelius Cclsus, gives it as his opinion that it is %0anot that the nature of this vine is repugnant to the climate %0aof Italy, but that it is the mode of cultivating it that is %0a%0aProbably from "albus," "white." Poinsinct thinks that it may %0ahave been so called from the Celtic word alb, or a/p, a mountain, and that %0ait grew on elevated spots. This, however, is probably fanciful. %0a%0aCalled by the Greeks afifOvarov, from its comparatively harmless %0aqualities. %0a^- Or "sober" vine. %0a%0a«3 Hardouin says that in his time it was still cultivated abont Macerata, %0ain the Roman States. Fee thinks that it may be one of the climbing %0avines, supported by forks, cultivated in tlie central provinces of France. %0aSee also Ji. xxiii. c. 19, as to the effects produced by its wine. %0a%0a6* Poinsinet gives a Cclto- Scythian origin to this word, and says that it %0ameans "injured by fogs." This appears to be supported in some measure %0aby what is stated below. %0a%0aQ 2 %0a%0a%0a%0a228 %0a%0a%0a%0aPLTinr's natuhal nisrouT. %0a%0a%0a%0a[Book XlV. %0a%0a%0a%0aAvrong, and the anxiety to force it to put forth its shoots ; a %0amode of treatment, he thinks, which absorbs all its fertilitj', %0aunless the soil in which it is planted happens to be rcmtirkably %0arich, and by its support prevents it from being exhausted. It %0ais said that this vine is never carbuncled,** a remarkable qua- %0ality, if, indeed, it really is the fact that there is any vine in %0aexistence that is exempt from the natural influences of the %0aclimate. %0a%0aThe spionia, by some called the " spinea,""* is able to bear %0aheat very well, and thrives in the autumn and rainy weather : %0aindeed, it is the only one among all the vines that does well %0aamid fogs, for which reason it is peculiar to the territory of %0aRavenna.*'' The venicula is one of those that blossom the %0astrongest, and its grapes are particularly well adapted for pre- %0aserving in jars. The Campanians, however, prefer to give it %0athe name of " scircula," while others, again, call it " stacula." %0aTarracina has a vine known as the " numisiana;" it has no %0aqualities of its own, but has characteristics just according to %0athe nature of the soil in which it is planted : the wine, how- %0aever, if kept in the earthen casks '^^ of Surrentum, is remark- %0aable for its goodness, that is to say, as far south as Vesuvius. %0aOn arriving in that district, we find the Murgentina,™ the very %0abest among all those that come from Sicily. Some, indeed,' ' %0acall the vine " Pompeiana,"" and it is more particularly fruitful %0awhen grown in Latium, just as the " horconia" is productive %0anowhere but in Campania. Of a contrary nature is the vine %0aknown as the " argeica," and by Virgil called " argitis:"'* %0ait makes the ground all the more'* productive, and is remark- %0a's See B. xvii. c. 37. %0a%0a^'^ Or " thorny" vine. Fee queries why it should be thus called. %0a%0a'' This humid, marshy locality was noted foTr the badness of its grapes, %0aand consequently of its wine. %0a%0a"8 Hardouin thinks that this is the " Marze mina " of the Venetians : %0awhence, perhaps, its ancient name. %0a%0a69 " Testis."

These %0atwo lines have been introduced by Sillig, from one of the MSS., for the %0afirst time. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 4.] %0a%0a%0a%0aVAEIETIE8 OF THE VINE. %0a%0a%0a%0a229 %0a%0a%0a%0aably stout in its resistance to rain and the effects of old age, %0athough it will hardly produce wine every year ; it ip remark- %0aable for the abundant crops which it bears, though the grapes %0aare held but in small esteem for eating. The vine known as %0athe " metica" lasts well for years, and offers a successful re- %0asistance to all changes of weather ; the grape is black, and the %0awine assumes a tawny hue when old. %0a%0a(3.) The varieties that have been mentioned thus far are %0athose that are generally known ; the others belong to peculiar %0acountries or individual localities, or else arc of a mixed nature, %0athe produce of grafting. Thus the vine known as the " Tuder- %0anis,"'^ is peculiar to the districts of Etruria, and so too is the %0avine that bears the name of " Florentia." At Arretium the %0atalpona, the etesiaca, and the consemina, are particularly ex- %0acellent.'* The talpona,'' which is a black grape, produces a %0apale, straw-coloured'** must ': the etesiaca" is apt to deceive; %0athe more the wine it produces the better the quality, but it %0ais a remarkable fact, that just as it has reached that point its %0afecundity ceases altogether. The consemina®" bears a black %0agrape, but its wine will not keep, though the grape itself is %0aa most excellent keeper ; it is gathered fifteen days later than %0aany other kind of grape : this vine is very fruitful, but its %0agrape is only good for eating. The leaves of this tree, like %0athose of the wild vine, turn the colour of blood just before the %0afall : the same is the case also with some ®' other varieties, but %0ait is a proof that they are of very inferior quality. %0a%0aThe irtiola*- is a vine peculiar to Umbria and the terri- %0a%0a%0a%0aes Hardouin thinks that it is so called from Tuder, a town of Etruria. %0aSee B. iii. c. 19. , ^ %0a%0a'15 Sillio' suo-o-csts that the reading here is eorrupt, and that i'liny %0ameans to say that the vine called Florentia is particularly excellent, and %0amerely to state that the talpona, &c., are peculiar to Arretium : for, as %0ahe says, speaking directly afterwards in disparagement ot them ,^ it is not %0alikely he would pronounce them "opima," of "first-rate quality." %0aFrom " talpa," a " mole," in consequence of its black colour. %0a%0a■9 rrtbably so called from the Etesian winds, which improved its growth. %0a%0aso Perhaps meaning "double-seeded." We may here remark, that the %0awines of Tuscany, though held in little esteem in ancient times, are highly %0aesteemed at the present day, , - ^ , r xv r n %0a%0a81 The leaves of most varieties turn red just before the faU. %0a%0a»2 And Baccius thinks that this is the kind from which the raisms of the %0a%0a%0a%0a230 %0a%0a%0a%0aPLINt's UTATUBAL niSTOET. %0a%0a%0a%0a[Book XIV. %0a%0a%0a%0atories of Mevania and Picenum, while the piimula" belong %0ato Amiternum. In the same districts we find the vine called %0abannanica," which is yery deceptive, though the people are %0aremarkably fond of its fruit. The municipal town of Pom- %0apeii has given its name to the Pompeia/'' although it is to be %0afound in greater abundance in the territory of Clusium. The %0aTiburina, also, is so called from the municipal town of Tibur, %0aalthough it is in this district that they have lately discovered %0athe grape known as the " oleaginea," from its strong resem- %0ablance to an olive : this being the very last kind of grape that %0ahas been introduced. The Sabines and the Laurentes are the %0aonly people acquainted with the vinaciola.*'' As to the \4nes %0aof Mount Gaurus,^ I am aware that, as they have been trans- %0aplanted from the Falernian territory, they bear the name of %0a"Falemian:" but it is a fact that the Falemian vine, when %0atransplanted, rapidly degenerates. Some persons, too, have %0amade out a Tarentine variety, with a grape of remarkable %0asweetness : the grapes of the " capnios,"*^ the " bucconiatis,"^ %0aand the " tarrupia," grow on the hills of Thurii, and are %0anever gathered till after the frost commences. Pisae enjoys %0athe Parian vine, and Mutina the prusinian,'' with a black %0agrape, the wine of which turns pale within four years. It is %0aa very remarkable thing, but there is a grape here that turns %0around with the sun, in its diurnal motion, a circumstance from %0awhich it has received the name of " streptos."^^ In Italy, the %0a%0asun, common in Italy, and more particularly in the Valley of Bevagna, the %0aMevania of Pliny, are made. %0a%0aPerhaps from "pumilio," a dwarf. %0a%0a^ The " royal" vine, according to Poinsinet, who would derive it from %0athe Sclavonic " ban." %0a%0a85 Previously mentioned, p. 228. %0a%0a8« The residence of Horace, now Tivoli. %0a%0aBaccius says that the wine of this grape was thin like water, and that %0athe vine was trained on lofty trees, a mode of cultivation still followed in %0athe vicinity of Rome.

Fee %0asuggests that this may be the slow-ripening grape of France, called the %0a" verjus," or " rognon de coq." %0a%0a^ Possibly meaning the '• mouthful." %0a%0a'1 Perhaps so called from Prusa in Bithynia, a district which bore ex- %0acellent grapes. %0a%0a^ Or the " turning " grape. A fabulous story no doubt, originating in %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 4.] %0a%0a%0a%0aVAEIETIES OF THE TINE. %0a%0a%0a%0a231 %0a%0a%0a%0aGallic vine is a great favourite, while beyond ihe Alps that of %0aPicenum^^ is preferred. Virgil has made mention »^ of the %0aThasian vine, the Mareotis, the lagea, and several other foreign %0avarieties, which are not to be found in Italy. %0a%0aThere are some vines, again, that are remarkable, not for %0atheir wine, but for their grapes, such, for instance, as the am- %0abrosia, one of the " duracinus kind, a grape which requires %0ano potting, but will keep perfectly well if left on the vine, so %0aremarkable is the strength with which it is endowed for with- %0astanding the effects of cold, heat, and stormy weather. The %0a" orlhampelos," " too, is a vine that requires neither tree nor %0astay, as it is well able to sustain its own weight. This, how- %0aever, is not the case with the " dactylis,"^^ the stem of which %0ais no thicker than the finger. The " columbina " is one of %0athose with the finest clusters, and still more so is the purple %0a" bimammia ;" it does not bear in clusters,' but only secondaiy %0abunches. There is the tripedanea,^ too, a name which it owes %0ato the length of its clusters, and the scirpula,' with its shrivelled %0aberry ; the Rhjetica,* too, so called in the Maritime Alps, though %0avery difi'crent from the grape of that name which is so highly %0aesteemed, and of which we have previously spoken ; for in %0athis variety the clusters are small, the grapes lie closely packed, %0a%0athe name, probably. Fee suggests that it may have originated in the not %0auncommon practice of letting the bunches hang after they were ripe, and %0athen twisting them, which was thought to increase the juice. %0aIn the modern Marches of Ancona. %0aGeorgics, ii. 91, et seq. %0a%0aSunt Thasise vites, sunt et Mareotides albae : %0a* * « * » %0a%0aEt passo Psithia utilior. tenuisque Lageos, %0aTentatura pedes olim, vincturaque linguam, %0a%0aPurpurcaj, Prcciaeque %0a%0a5* A muscatel, Fee thinks. %0a%0a'■^ Or "hard-berried."

Among the vines too, that have %0anot as yet been mentioned, there are the ^gian and the %0allhodian^ kinds, as also the uncialis, so called, it would seem, %0afrom its grape being an ounce in weight. There is the picina'" %0atoo, the blackest'^ grape known, and the stephanitis,'- the %0aclusters of which jS'ature, in a sportive mood, has arranged in %0athe form of a garland, the leaves being interspersed among %0athe grapes; there are the grapes, too, known as the "forenses,'"'' %0aand which quickly come to maturity, recommend themselves %0ato the buyer by their good looks, and are easily carried from %0aplace to place. %0a%0aOn the other hand, those known as the "cinerea"'^ are %0acondemned by their very looks, and so arc the rabuscula and %0athe asinusca ; ^' the produce of the alopecis,^* which resembles %0ain colour a fox's tail, is held in less disesteem.

(4.) EEMARKABLE FACTS CONNECTED WITH THE %0a%0aCDLTURE OF THE VINE. %0a%0aThe elder Cato, who was rendered more particularly illus- %0atrious by his triumph-^ and the censorship, and even more so %0aby his literary fame, and the precepts which he has given to %0athe lloman people upon every subject of utility, and the %0aproper methods of cultivation in particular ; a man who, by %0athe universal confession, was the first husbandman of his age %0aand without a rival — has mentioned a few varieties only of %0athe vine, the very names of some of which are by this utterly %0aforgotten.-^ His statement on this subject deserves our %0aseparate consideration, and requires to be quoted at length, in %0aorder that we may make ourselves acquainted with the differ- %0aent varieties of this tree that were held in the highest esteem %0ain the year of the City of Rome 600, about the time of the %0acapture of Carthage and Corinth, the period of his death : it %0awill show too, what great advances civilization has made in %0athe last two hundred and thirty years. The following are the %0aremarks which he has made on the subject of the vine and the %0agrape. %0a%0a^' As the leaves of the vine arc universally divided, it has been considered %0aby many of the commentators that this is not in reality a vine, but the %0aArbutus uva ursi of Linnaeus. The fruit, however, of that ericaceous %0aplant is remarkably acrid, and i^t sweet, as Pliny states. Fee rejects this %0asolution. %0a%0aAubenas, in the Vivarais, according to Hardouin ; Alps, according to %0aBrotier. We must reject this assertion as fabulous. %0a-■- In li.c. 194, for his successes in Spain. %0a%0a23 Mode of culture, locality, climate, and other extraneous circumstances, %0awork, no doubt, an entire change in the nature of the vine. %0a%0a%0a%0a234 %0a%0a%0a%0aTLTNT's NATrilAL HISTOKT. [Book XIV. %0a%0a%0a%0a" Where the site is considered to be most fovourablo to the %0agrowth of the vine, and exposed to the warmth of the sun, %0ayou will do well to plant the smalP^ Aminean, as well as the %0atwo eugenia,-* and the smaller helvia."* On the other hand, %0awhere the soil is of a denser nature or more exposed to fogs, %0athe greater Aminean should be planted, or else the Murgcn- %0atine," or the Apician of Lucania. The other varieties of the %0agrape are, for the most part, adaj)ted to any kind of soil ; they %0aare best preserved in a lora.** The best for keeping by hang- %0aing, are the duracinus kind, the greater Aminean, and the %0aScantian;^^ these, too, will make excellent raisins for keeping %0aif dried at the blacksmith's forge." There are no precepts in %0athe Latin language on this subject more ancient than these, so %0anear are we to the very commencement of all our practical %0aknowledge ! The Aminean grape, of which mention has been %0amade above, is by Varro called the " Scantian." %0a%0aIn our own times we have but few instances of any consum- %0amate skill that has been manifested in reference to this subject : %0athe less excuse then should we have for omitting any particular %0awhich may tend to throw a light upon the profits that may %0abe derived from the culture of the vine, a point which on all %0aoccasions is regarded as one of primary importance. Acilius %0aSthenelus, a man of plebeian rank, and the son of a freedman, %0aacquired very considerable repute from the cultivation of a vine- %0ayard in the territory of Is'omentum, not more than sixty jugera %0ain extent, and which he finally sold for four hundred thousand %0asesterces. Vetulenus iEgialus too, a freedman as well, ac- %0aquired very considerable note in the district of Liternum,^** in %0aCampania, and, indeed, received a more extensive share of %0athe public favour, from the fact that he cultivated the spot %0a%0a^ Probably the first of the five that he has mentioned in c. 4. %0a%0a25 He has only mentioned one sort in c. 4. %0a%0a2« See c. 4.

The %0agreatest celebrity of all, however, was that which, by the %0aagency of the same Sthenelus, was accorded to Ilhemmius %0aPaljBmon, who was also equally famous as a learned gram- %0amarian. This person bought, some twenty years ago, an estate %0aat the price of six hundred thousand sesterces in the same %0adistrict of Nomentum, about ten miles distant from the City of %0aRome. The low price of property ^- in the suburbs, on every %0aside of the City, is well known ; but in that quarter in particu- %0alar, it had declined to a most remarkable extent; for the %0aestate which, he purchased had become deteriorated by long- %0acontinued neglect, in addition to which it was situate in the %0avery worst part of a by no means favourite locality. Such %0aAvas the nature of the property of which he thus undertook the %0acultivation, not, indeed, with any commendable views or inten- %0ations at first, but merely in that spirit of vanity for which he %0awas notorious in so remarkable a degree. The vineyards were %0aall duly dressed afresh, and hoed, under the superintendence of %0aSthenelus ; the result of which was that Palaemon, while thus %0aplajdng the husbandman, brought this estate to such an almost %0aincredible pitch of perfection, that at the end of eight years %0athe vintage, as it hung on the trees, was knocked down to a %0apurchaser for the sum of four hundred thousand sesterces; %0awhile all the world was running to behold the heaps upon heaps %0aof grapes to be seen in these vineyards. The neighbours, by %0away of finding some excuse for their own indolence, gave all %0athe credit of this remarkable success to Palaimon's profound %0aerudition ; and at last Annseus Seneca,^'' who both held the %0ahighest rank in the learned world, and an amount of power and %0ainfluence which at last proved too much for him — this same %0aSeneca, who was far from being an admii-er of frivolity, was %0aseized with such vast admiration of this estate, as not to feel %0aashamed at conceding this victory to a man who was other- %0awise the object of his hatred, and who would be sure to make %0athe very most of it, by giving him four times the original cost %0a31 The elder Africanus.

I dismiss, however, all the fa- %0abulous stories and various traditions which we find relative to %0aits origin, except, indeed, the one which states that Aristaeus,^^ a %0anative of the same country, was the first person that mixed %0ahoney ^' with wine, natural productions, both of them, of the %0ahighest degree of excellence. Homer^^ has stated that the %0aMai'onean wine was mixed with water in the proportion of %0atwenty measures of water to one of wine. The wine that is %0astill produced in the same district retains all its former %0astrength, and a degree of vigour that is quite insuperable. %0aMucianus, who thrice held the consulship, and one of our %0amost recent authors, when in that part of the world was %0aAvitness himself to the fact, that with one sextarius of this %0awine it was the custom to mix no less than eighty sextarii of %0a%0a^5 Said to have been so called from Maron, a king of Thrace, who dwelt %0ain the vicinity of the Thracian Isniarus. See B. iv. c. 18. Homer men- %0ations this wine in the Odyssey, B. ix. c. 197, et seq. It was red, honey- %0asweet, fragrant.

In the %0ayear of the consulship of L. Opimius, when C, Gracchus," the %0atribune of the people, engaging in sedition, was slain, the %0agrowth of every Avine was of the very highest quality. In %0athat year, the weather was remarkable for its sereneness, and %0athe ripening of the grape, the " coctura,''"* as they call it, %0awas fully effected by the heat of the sun. This was in the %0ayear of the City 633. There are wines still preserved of this %0ayear's growth, nearly two hundred years ago ; they have %0aassumed the consistency of honey, with a rough taste ; for %0asuch, in fact, is the nature of wines, that, when extremely %0aold, it is impossible to drink them in a pure state ; and they %0arequire to be mixed with water, as long keeping renders them %0aintolerably bitter.^* A very small quantity of the Opimian %0awine, mixed with them, will suffice for the seasoning of other %0awines. Let us suppose, according to the estimated value of %0athese wines in those days, that the original price of them was %0aone hundred sesterces per amphora : if we add to this six per %0acent, per annum, a legal and moderate interest, we shall %0athen be able to ascertain what was the exact price of the %0atwelfth part of an amphora at the beginning of the reign of %0aCaius Caisar, the son of Germanicus, one hundred and sixty %0ayears after that consulship. In relation to this fact, we have %0aa remarkable instance,'"' when we call to mind the life of Pom- %0a%0a«» By " black " wines he means those that had the same colour as our %0aport. " II. xi. 638.

It %0awill not be foreign to my purpose on the present occasion to %0astate the advice which Androcydes, a man famous for his %0awisdom, wrote to Alexander the Great, with the view of put- %0ating a check on his intemperance : " When you are about to %0adrink wine, 0 king !" said he, "remember that you are about %0ato drink the blood of the earth : hemlock is a poison to man, %0awine a poison*- to hemlock."

This is not the case, but it is said by some that vinegar is. It is %0athe plant hemlock (cicuta) that is meant, and not the fatal draught that %0awas drunk by Socrates and Philopcemen.

FIFTY KINDS OF GEXEEOUS WINES. %0a%0aWho can entertain a doubt that some kinds of wine are %0amore agreeable to the palate than others, or that even out %0aof the very same vat^' there are occasionally produced wines %0athat are by no means of equal goodness, the one being much %0asuperior to the other, whether it is that it is owing to the %0acask,*^ or to some other fortuitous circumstance ? Let each %0aperson, therefore, constitute himself his own judge as to which %0akind it is that occupies the pre-eminence. Livia°^ Augusta, %0awho lived to her eighty-second year,^' attributed her longevity %0ato the wine of Pucinum,^® as she never drank any other. This %0awine is grown near a bay of the Adriatic, not far from Mount %0aTimavus, upon a piece of elevated rocky ground, where the %0asea-breeze ripens a few grapes, the produce of which supplies %0aa few amphorae : there is not a wine that is deemed superior %0ato this for medicinal purposes. I am strongly of opinion that %0athis is the same wine, the produce of the Adriatic Gulf, upon %0awhich the Greeks have bestowed such wonderful encomiums, %0aunder the name of Praetetianum. %0a%0aThe late Emperor Augustus preferred the Setinum to all %0aothers, and nearly all the emperors that have succeeded him %0ahave followed his example, having learnt from actual expe- %0arience that there is no danger of indigestion and flatulence %0aresulting from the use of this liquor : this wine is grown in %0athe country** that lies just above Eorum Appii.""

This vineyard has, however, now disappeared, the %0aresult of the carelessness of the cultivator, combined Avith its %0aown limited extent, and the works on the canal which Nero %0acommenced, in order to provide a navigation from Lake Aver- %0anus to Ostia. %0a%0aThe second rank belonged to the wine of the Falernian ter- %0aritory, of which the Faustianum was the most choice variety ; %0athe result of the care and skill employed upon its cultivation. %0aThis, however, has also degenerated very considerably, in con- %0asequence of the growers being more solicitous about quantity*- %0athau quality. The Falernian"^ vineyards begin at the bridge of %0aCampania, on the left-hand as you journey towards the Urbana %0aColonia of Sylla, which was lately a township of the city of %0aCapua. As to the Faustian vineyards, they extend about four %0amiles from a village near Cajdicia;," the same village being six %0amiles from Sinuessa. There is now no wine known that ranks %0ahigher than the Falernian ; it is the only one, too, among all %0athe wines that takes fire on the application of flame. There %0aare three varieties of it — the rough, the sweet, and the thin. %0aSome persons make the following distinctions : the Caucinum, %0athey say, grows on the summit of this range of hills, the Faus- %0atianum on the middle slopes, and the Falernum at the foot : %0athe fact, too, should not be omitted, that none of the grapes %0athat produce these more famous wines have by any means an %0aagreeable flavour. %0a%0aTo the third rank belonged the various wines of Alba, in the %0avicinity of the City, remarkable for their sweetness, and some- %0a%0a^1 See B. iii. c. 9.

Tiberius Caesar used to say that the physicians had %0aconspired thus to dignify the Surrentinum, which was, in fact, %0aonly another name for generous vinegar ; while Caius Caesar, %0awho succeeded him, gave it the name of "noble vappa."*'" %0aVying in reputation with these are the Massic wines, from the %0aspots which look from Mount Gaurus towards Puteoli and %0aBaiae.™ As to the wines of Stata, in the vicinity of Falernum, %0athere is no doubt that they formerly held the very highest %0arank, a fact which proves very clearly that every district has %0aits own peculiar epochs, just as all other things have their rise %0aand their decadence. The Calenian'' wines, too, from the same %0aneigliboiirhood, used to be preferred to those last mentioned, %0aas also the Fundanian," the produce of vines grown on stay.-*, %0aor else attached to shrubs.

But the most celebrated of all %0aof them, owing to the fact that Messala''* used to drink it, and %0awas indebted to it for his excellent health, was the wine %0aof Lagara,'^ which was grown not far from Grumentum.^ In %0aCampania, more recently, new growths under new names have %0agained considerable credit, either owing to careful cultivation, %0aor else to some other fortuitous circumstances : thus, for in- %0astance, we find four miles from Neapolis the Trebellian,^ near %0a%0a^- Now P?ziers, in the south of France. The wines of this part are %0aconsidered excellent at the present day. Tliat of Frontignan grows in its %0avicinity. Fee is inclined to think, from Pliny's remarks here, that the %0aancients and the moderns differed entirely in their notions as to what con- %0astitutes good or bad wine. %0a%0aHe means, beyond modern Provence, and Languedoc : districts fa- %0amous for their excellent wines, more particularly the latter. %0a%0a3' Fee deems all this quite incredible. Our English experience, however, %0atells us that it is by no means so ; much of the wine that is drunk in this %0acoimtry is indebted for flavour as well as colour to anything but the grape. %0a%0a9' The wines of modea-n Otranto are ordinarily of good quality. %0a%0aBaccius reads " Seberiniana," but is probably wrong.

At the present day, the most esteemed of all is the wine %0aof Clazomenoe,'* since they have learned to season it more %0asparingly with sea-water. The wine of Lesbos has naturally %0aa taste of sea- water. That from Mount Tmolus'* is not so %0amuch esteemed by itself^" for its qualities as a wine, as for its %0apeculiar sweetness. It is on account of this that it is mixed %0awith other wines, for the purpose of modifying their harsh %0aflavour, by imparting to them a portion of its own sweetness ; %0awhile at the same time it gives them age, for immediately %0aafter the mixture they appear to be much older than they %0areally are.

(8.) SEVEN KINDS OF SALTED WINES. %0a%0aThus far we have treated of wines, the goodness of which is %0adue to the country of their growth. In Greece the wine that %0ais known by the name of " bion," and which is administered %0afor its curative qualities in several maladies (as Ave shall have %0aoccasion to remark when we come to speak on the subject of %0aMedicine^'), has been justly held in the very highest esteem. %0aThis wine is made in the following manner : the grapes are %0aplucked before they are quite ripe, and then dried in a hot %0asun : for three days they are turned three times a day, and on %0athe fourth day they are pressed, after which the juice is put %0ain casks, and left to acquire age in the heat of the sun.'*'' %0a%0aThe people of Cos mix sea- water in large quantities with %0atheir wines, an invention which they first learned from a slave, %0awlio adopted this method of supplying the deficiency that had %0abeen caused by his thievish propensities.

All these mixtures have been de- %0avised for the adulteration of honey." As to those varieties %0awhich we have previously mentioned, their merits depend %0aupon the grape, and the soil in which it is grown. Next %0aafter the raisin- wine of Crete,'^ those of Cilicia and Africa are %0aheld in the highest esteem, both in Italy as well as the ad- %0ajoining provinces. It is well known that it is made of a grape %0ato which the Greeks have given the name of " stica," and which %0aby us is called " apiana it is also made of the scirpula.'" %0aThe grapes arc left on the vine to dry in the sun, or else are %0aboiled in the dolium." Some persons make this wine of the %0aBweet and early white''^ grape : they leave the grapes to %0adry in the sun, until they have lost pretty nearly half their %0aweight, after which thej"- crush them and subject them to a %0agentle pressure. They then draw off the juice, and add to %0athe pulp that is left an equal quantity of well-water, the pro- %0aduct of which is raisin-wine of second quality," The more %0acareful makers not only do this, but take care also after drying %0athe grapes to remove the stalks, and then steep the raisins in %0awine of good quality until they swell, after which they press %0athem. This kind of raisin-wine is preferred to all others : %0awith the addition of water, they follow the same plan in %0amaking the wine of second quality. %0a%0aThe liquor to which the Greeks give the name of " aigleu- %0acos,"^^ is of middle' qualit}^ between the sirops and what is %0aproperly called Aviue ; with us it is called " semper mustum.'"* %0aIt is only made by using great precaution, and taking care %0athat the must does not ferment;'* such being the state of the %0a%0a«« This was evidently a kind of grape sirop, or grape jelly.

To attain this object, the %0amust is taken from tlie vat and put into casks, which are im- %0amediately plunged into water, and there left to remain until %0athe wint(;r solstice is past, and frosty weather has made its %0aappearance. There is another kind, again, of natural aigleucos, %0aw^hich is known in the province of Narbonensis by the name %0aof " dulce,"" and more particularly in the district of the %0aVocontii. In order to make it, they keep the grape hanging %0aon the tree for a considerable time, taking care to twist the %0astalk. Some, again, make an incision in the bearing shoot, as %0adeep as the pith, while others leave the grapes to dry on tiles. %0aThe only grape, however, that is used in these various pro- %0acesses is that of the vine known as the helvennaca."'"' %0a%0aSome persons add to the list of these sweet wines that %0aknown as " diachyton."" It is made by drying grapes in thn %0aBun, and then placing them for seven days in a closed place %0aupon hurdles, some seven feet from the ground, care being %0ataken to protect them at night from the dews : on the eighth %0aday they are trodden out : this method, it is said, produces a %0aliquor of exquisite bouquet and flavour. The liquor known as %0amelitites* is also one of the sweet wines : it differs from %0amulsum, in being made of must ; to five congii of rough-fla- %0avoured must they put one congius of honey, and one cyathus %0aof salt, and they are then brought to a gentle boil : this mix- %0ature is of a rough flavour. Among these varieties, I ought to %0aplace what is known as " protropum such being the name %0agiven by some to the must that runs spontaneouslj^ from the %0agrapes before they are trodden out. Directly it flows it is %0aput into flaggons, and allowed to ferment ; after which it is %0aleft to ripen for forty days in a summer sun, about the rising %0aof the Dog-star. %0a%0a" "Sweet" drink. Fee seems to think that this sweet wine must have %0abeen somethinn^ similar to champagne.

TUREE VARIETIES OF SECOND-KATE WINE. %0a%0aThose cannot properly be termed wines, which by the %0aGreeks are known under the name of " deuteria,"** and to %0awhich, in common with Cato, we in Italy give the name of %0a" lora,' *'^ being made from the husks of grapes steeped in %0awater. Still, however, this beverage is reckoned as making %0acue of the " labourers'"*' wines. There are three varieties of %0ait: the first is made in the following manner: — After the %0amust is drawn off, one-tenth of its amount in water is added %0ato the husks, which are then left to soak a day and a night, %0aand then are again subjected to pressure. A second kind, %0athat which the Greeks are in the habit of making, is prepared %0aby adding one-third in water of the quantity of must that has %0abeen drawn off, and after submitting tlie pulp to pressure, the %0aresult is reduced by boiling to one-third of its original quan- %0atity. A. third kind, again, is pressed out from the wine-lees ; %0aCato gives it the name of " Ikcatum."*^ None of these be- %0averages, however, Avill keep for more than a single year. %0a%0aCHAP. 13.

The Posthumian Law, promulgated by King %0aNuma, has an injunction to the following effect : — " Sprinkle %0anot the funeral pyre with wine ;" a law to which he gave his %0asanction, no doubt, in consequence of the remarkable scarcity %0aof that commodity in those days. By the same law, he also %0apronounced it illegal to make a libation to the gods of wine that %0awas the produce of an unpruned vine, his object being to compel %0athe husbandmen to prune their vines ; a duty which they %0ashowed themselves reluctant to perform, in consequence of the %0adanger which attended climbing the trees."' M. Varro in- %0aforms us, that Mezentius, the king of Etruria, succoured the %0aRutuli against the Latini, upon condition that he should re- %0aceive all the wine that was then in the territorj' of Latium. %0a%0a(13.) At Rome it was not lawful for women to drink wine. %0aAmong the various anecdotes conuected with this subject, we %0afind that the wife of Egnatius Mecenius was slain by her hus- %0aband with a stick, because she had drunk some wine from the vat, %0aand that he was absolved from the murder by Romulus. Fabius %0aPictor, in his Rook of Annals, has stated that a certain lady, %0afor having opened a purse in which the keys of the wine-cellar %0awere kept, was starved to death by her family : and Cato tells %0aus, that it was the usage for the male relatives to give the %0afemales a kiss, in order to ascertain whether they smelt of %0a" temetum ;" for it was by that name that wine was then %0aknown, whence our word " temulentia," signifying drunken- %0aness. Cn. Domitius, the judge, once gave it as his opinion, %0athat a certain woman appeared to him to have drunk more %0awine than was requisite for her health, and without the know- %0aledge of her husband, for which reason he condemned her to %0alose her dower. For a very long time there was the greatest %0a%0a" Circa pericula arbusti." This is probably the meaning of this very %0aelliptical passage.

(14.) — SOME EEMARKABLE FACTS CONNECTED WITH %0aWINE-L0FI3. TUE OPIMIAN AVINE. %0a%0aThe fact of the existence of the Opimian wine gives un- %0adoubted proof that there were wine-lot'ts,^ and that wine was %0aracked off in the year of Home 633, Italy being already alive %0ato the blessings she enjoyed. Still, however, the several %0avarieties that are now so celebrated were not so in those days ; %0aand hence it is that all the wines that were grown at that %0ajjeriod have only the one general name of "Opimian" wines, %0airom the then consul Opimius. So, too, for a long time after- %0awards, and, indeed, so late as the times of our grandfathers, the %0awines from beyond sea were held in the highest esteem, even %0athough Falernian was already known, a fact which we learn %0afrom the line of the Comic writer,* " I shall draw five cups of %0aThasian and two of ralornian." %0a%0aP. Licinius Crassus, and L. Julius Caesar, who were Cen- %0asors in the year from the Building of the City 665, issued an %0aedict forbidding the sale of either Greek or Amincan wine at %0aa higher price than eight asses the quadrantaP — for such, in %0afact, are the exact words of the edict. Indeed, the Greek %0awines were so highl)- valued, that not more than a single cup %0awas served to a guest daring the repast. %0a%0aCHAP. 17. — AT WnAT PERIOD FOUR KINDS OF WINS W1:RE FIRST %0aSERVED AT TABLE. %0a%0aM. Varro gives us the following statement as to the wines %0athat were held in the highest esteem at table in his day : %0a" L. Lucullus, when a boy, never saw an entertainment at his %0afather's house, however sumptuous it might be, at which Greek %0a%0a* Must boiled down to half its original quantity. %0a%0a3 Apothecas. The " apothecae " were rooms at the top of the house, in %0awhich the wines were placL-d for the purpose of seasoning. Sometimes a %0acurrent of smoke was directed through them. They were quite distinct %0afrom the " cella vinaria," or "wine-cellar." The Opimian wine is men- %0ationed in c. 4. %0a%0a* This writer is unknown. * Or amphora. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 18.] %0a%0a%0a%0aUSES OF THE W ILD TINE. %0a%0a%0a%0a255 %0a%0a%0a%0awine was handed round more than once during the repast: %0awhereas he himself, when he returned from Asia, distributed %0aas a largess among the people more than a hundred thousand %0acongiaria* of the same Avine. C. Sentius, whom we have seen %0aPraetor, used to say that Chian wine never entered his house %0auntil his physician prescribed it to him for the cardiac' dis- %0aease. On the other hand, Hortcnsius left ten thousand casks %0aof it to his heir." Such is the statement made by Varro. %0a%0a(15.) And besides, is it not a well-known fact that Csesar, %0awhen Dictator, at the banquet given on the occasion of his %0atriumph, allotted to each table an amphora of Falernian and a %0acadus of Chian? On the occasion, too, of his triumph for his %0avictories in Spain, he put before the guests both Cbian as well %0aas Falernian ; and again, at the banquet given on his third %0aconsulship,* he gave Falernian, Chian, Lesbian, and Mamer- %0atine ; indeed, it is generally agreed that this was the first %0aoccasion on which four different kinds of wine were served at %0atable. It was after this, then, that all the other sorts camo %0ainto such very high repute, somewhere about the year of the %0aCity 700. %0a%0aCHAP. 18. (16.) THK USES OF THE WILD VINE. WHAT JUICES %0a%0aAliU N\TU1U.LLY TlIK COLDKST OF ALL. %0a%0aI am not surprised, then, that for these many ages there %0ahave been invented almost innumerable varieties of artificial %0awines, of which I shall now make some mention ; they are all %0aof them emi)loyed for medicinal purposes. We have already %0astated in a former Book how omi)liacium,* which is used for %0aunguents, is made. The liqupr known as " ocnanthinum " is %0amade from the wild vine,'" two pounds of the flowers of which %0aare steeped in a cadus of must, and are then changed at the %0aend of thirty days. In addition to this, the root and the %0a%0a« Vessels containing a congius, or the eighth of an amphora, nearly six %0apints English. %0a%0a' As to this malady, sec B. xi. c. 71. %0a%0a* B.C. 46. * ^- ^'i- • %0a%0aOr "labrusca." " Oinanthinum " means " made of vine flowers." The %0awild vine is not a distinct speciis from the cultivated \'ine : it is only a %0avariety of it known in botany as the Vitis silvestris labrusca of Tournefort. %0aFee thinks that as the must oould only be used in autumn, when the wild %0avine was not flowering, the flowers of it must have been dried. %0a%0a%0a%0a256 %0a%0a%0a%0aflint's NATTJHAL niSTORT. %0a%0a%0a%0a[Book XIV. %0a%0a%0a%0abusks of the grapes are employed in dressing leather. The %0agrapes, too, a little after the blossom has gone off, are sin- %0agularly efficacious as a specific for cooling the feverish heat of %0athe body in certain maladies, being, it is said, of a nature re- %0amarkable for extreme coldness. A portion of these grapes %0awither away, in consequence of the heat, before the rest, %0awhich are thence called solstitial''' grapes ; indeed, the whole %0aof them never attain maturity; if one of these grapes, in %0aan unripe state, is given to a barn-door fowl to eat, it is pro- %0aductive of a dislike to grapes for the future.'* %0a%0aCHAP. 19. SIXTT-SIX VARIETIES OF AETIFICIAL WINE. %0a%0aThe first of the artificial wines has wine for its basis ; it is %0acalled " adynrimon,"" and is made in the following manner. %0aTwenty sextarii of white must are boiled down with half that %0aquantity of water, until the amount of the water is lost by %0aevaporation. Some persons mix with the must ten sextarii of %0asea-water and an equal quantity of rain-water, and leave the %0awhole to evaporate in the sun for forty days. This beverage %0ais given to invalids to whom it is apprehended that wine may %0aprove injurious. %0a%0aThe next kind of artificial wine is that made of the ripe %0agrain of millet;'* a pound and a quarter of it with the straw %0ais steeped in two congii of must, and the mixture is poured off %0aat the end of six months. We have already stated" how %0avarious kinds of wine are made from the tree, the shrub, and %0athe herb, respectively known as the lotus. %0a%0aFrom fruit, too, the following wines are made, to the list of %0awhich we shall only add some necessary explanations : — First %0aof all, we find the fruit of the palm'* employed for this pur- %0a%0a13 " Solstitiales." Because they withstand the hoat of the solstice. Mar- %0acellus Empiricus calls them " caniculati," because they bear the heat of the %0aDog-star. %0a%0a1* Fee remarks that this assertion is quite erroneous. %0a%0a15 From the Greek, meaning " without strength." The mixture, Fee %0aremarks, would appear to be neither potable nor wholrsonio. %0a%0aSee B. xviii. c. 24. A kind of beer might be made with it, F^e savs ; %0abut this mixture must have been very unpalatable. %0a%0a" See B. xiii. c. 32. %0a%0a18 A vinous drink may be made in the manner here stated ; but the palm, %0awine of the peoples of Asia and Africa is only made of the fermented sap %0aof the tree. See B. xiii. c. 9. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 19 ] %0a%0a%0a%0aTAraETIES OF APiTIFICIAL "WtN'E. %0a%0a%0a%0a257 %0a%0a%0a%0apose by the Parthians as well as the Indians, and, indeod. %0athroughout all the countries of the East. A modius of tho %0akind of ripe date called "chydaeaj"^' is added to three congii %0aof water, and after being steeped for some time, they arc %0asubjected to pressure. Sycites^" is a preparation similarly %0amade from figs : some persons call it " palmiprimum,""' others, %0aagain, " catorchites : " if sweetness is not the maker's object, %0ainstead of water there is added the same quantity of iiusk %0ajuice^- of grapes. Of the Cyprian fig^^ a very excellent vinegar, %0atoo, is made, and of that of Alexandria a still superior. %0a%0aA wine is made, too, of tlie pods of the Syrian carob,^^ of %0apears, and of all kinds of apples. That known as " rhoites"^ %0ais made from pomegranates, and other varieties are prepared %0afrom cornels, medlars, sorb apples, dried mulberries, and pine- %0anuts these last are left to steep in must, and arc then pressed ; %0athe others produce a sweet liquor of tliemselvcs. We shall %0ahave occasion before long to show how Cato^* has pointed out %0athe method of making mj-rtites the Greeks, however, adopt %0aa different method in making it. They first boil tender sprigs %0aof myrtle witb the leaves on in white must, and after pound- %0aing them, boil down one pound of the mixture in three congii %0aof must, until it is reduced to a couple of congii. The be- %0average that is prepared in this manner with the berries of %0awild myrtle is known as " myrtidanum ;" it will stain the %0ahands. %0a%0aAmong the garden plants we find wines made of the follow- %0aing kinds : the radish, asparagus, cunila, origanum, parslcy- %0a%0a'9 lie says "caryotoc," and not chydajse, in B. xiii. c. 4. The modius %0a•was something more than our peck. %0a%0aFrom the Greek ovkti, a " fig." This wine was made, Fee thinks, %0afrom the produce of some variety of the sycamore.

A wine, %0atoo, is made of Gallic nard,^'-* and another kind of the wild^* %0avariety of that plant. %0a%0aI find, also, that vai'ious kinds of aromatites^' are pre- %0apared, differing but very little in their mode of composition %0afrom that of the unguents, being made in the first instance, %0aas I have already stated,^- of myrrh, and then at a later period %0aof Celtic nard," calamus, and aspalathus,'* of which cakes are %0amade, and are then thrown into either must or sweet wine. %0aOthers, again, make these wines of calamus, scented rush,** %0acostus,''^ Syrian nard," amomum,*® cassia,^^ cinnamon, saffron,"" %0apalm-dates, and foal-foot,*' all of which are made up into cakes %0ain a similar manner.

In a %0asimilar manner, hyssop wine is made of Ciliciun hyssop,*" bv %0aadding three ounces of it to two congii of must, or else by %0apounding three ounces of hyssop, and adding them to one %0acongius of must. Both of these wines may be made also in %0aanother method, by sowing these plants around the roots of %0avines. It is in this manner, too, that Cato tells us how to %0amake hellebore"' wine from black hellebore ; and a similar %0amethod is used for making scammony**- wine. The vine has a %0aremarkable propensity*^ of contracting the flavour of any plant %0atliat may happen to be growing near it ; and hence it is that %0ain the marshy lands of Patavium, the grape has the peculiar %0aflavour of the willow. So, in like manner, we find at Thasos %0ahellebore planted among the vines, or else wild cucumber, or %0ascammony ; the wine that is produced from these vines is %0aknown by the name of "phthorium," it being productive of %0aabortion. %0a%0aCondita.

TWELVE KINDS OF WINE WITH MIRACULOUS %0a%0aPEOPEETIES. %0a%0aThere are some miraculous properties, too, in certain wines. %0aIt is said that in Arcadia there is a Avine grown Avhicli is %0aproductive of fruitfulness"' in women, and of madness in men ; %0awhile in Achaia, and more especially in the vicinity of Cary- %0ania, there is a wine which causes abortion ; an eflect which is %0aequally produced if a woman in a state of pregnancy happens %0aonly to eat a grape of the vine from which it is grown, although %0ain taste it is in no way different from ordinary grapes : again, %0ait is confidently asserted that those who drink the wine of %0aTroezen never bear children. Thasos, it is said, produces two %0avarieties of wine with quite opposite properties. By one kind %0asleep is produced,^* by the other it is prevented. There is %0aalso in the same island a vine known as the " theriaca,"*" the %0awine and grapes of which are a cure for the bites of serpents. %0aThe libanian vine^ also produces a wine with the smell of %0afrankincense, with which they make libations to the gods, while, %0aon the other hand, the produce of that known as " aspen dios,^" %0ais banished from all the altars : it is said, too, that this last %0avine is never touched by any bird. %0a%0aThe Egyptians call by the name of "Thasian,"^ a cortnin %0agrape of that country, remarkable for its sweetness and its %0a%0a^8 Our medicinal wines will mostly keep longer than this, owing probably %0ato the diiFerence in tbe mode of making the real wines that form their %0abasis. %0a%0aThere is Httle doubt that this is fabulous : wine taken in excess, wo %0aknow, is productive of loss of the senses, frenzy in the shape of deUrium %0atremens. %0a%0aThis is not unlikely ; for, as Fee remarks, the red wines, containing %0aa large proportion of alcohol, act upon the brain and promote sleep, while %0atlie white wines, charged with carbonic gas, are productive of wakefulness. %0a%0aOr healing vine.

On the other hand, there is in Lycia a %0acertain grape which proves astringent to the stomach when %0arelaxed. Egypt has a wine, too, known as "echolas,"* which %0ais productive of abortion. There are some wines, which at %0athe rising of the Dog-star change their nature in the wine- %0alofts" where they are kept, and afterwards recover* their %0aoriginal quality. The same is the case, too, with wines when %0acarried across the seas : those that are able to withstand the %0amotion of the waves, appear afterwards to be twice as old ' as %0athey really are. %0a%0aCHAP. 23. (19.) WHAT WINES IT IS NOT LAWFUL TO USE IN TUE %0a%0aSACKED RITES. %0a%0aAs religion is the great basis of the ordinary usages of life, %0aI shall here remark that it is considered im})roper to oft'er %0alibations to the gods w'ith any wines which are the produce of %0aan unpruned vine, or of one that has been struck by lightning, %0aor near to which a dead man has been hung, or of grapes that %0ahave been trodden out by sore feet, or made of must from %0ahusks that have been cut,** or from grapes that have been %0apolkited by the fall of any unclean thing upon them. The %0aGreek wines are excluded also IVoni the sacred ministrations, %0abecause they contain a portion of w'atcr. %0a%0aThe vine itself is sometimes eaten; the tops of the shoots" %0aare taken off and boiled, and are then pickled in vinegar %0aand brine. %0a%0aCHAP. 24. — now MUST is usually pkepared. %0aIt will be as well now to make some mention of the methods %0a%0a* From iKj3aX\o>, " to eject." * Apothccis. %0a%0a" He alludes to the working of wines in periods of extreme heat ; also %0ain the spring. %0a%0a' Of our modern wines, Madeira and Bourdeaux improve by being carried %0aacross sea. Burgundy, if any thiug, deteriorates, by the diminution of its %0abouquet. %0a%0a8 After the grapes had been trodden and pressed, the husks were taken %0aout and their edges cut, and then again subjected to pressure : the result %0awas k^own as " tortivum," or "circumcisivum," a wine of very inferior %0aquality. %0a%0a» He alludes to the young; shoots, which have an agreeable acidity, %0aowing to acetic and tartaric acids. %0a%0aAcetic acid ; the result, no doubt, of the faulty mode of manufacture %0auniversally prevdeut ; their wines contained evidently but little alcohol. %0a%0a%0a%0a264 %0a%0a%0a%0aPLINi's NATURAL HISTORY. %0a%0a%0a%0a[Book XIV. %0a%0a%0a%0aused ill preparing wines ; indeed, several of the Greeks have %0awritten separate treatises on this subject, and have made a %0acomplete art of it, such, for instance, as Euphronitis, Aristo- %0amachus, Commiades, and Hicesius. The people of Africa are %0ain the habit of neutralizing such aciditj' as may be found %0awith gypsum, and in some parts with lime. The people of %0aGreece, on the other hand, impart briskness to their wines %0awhen too flat, with potters' earth, pounded marble, salt, or %0asea- water ; while in Italy, again, brown pitch is used for tliat %0apurpose in some parts, and it is the universal practice both %0athere as well as in the adjoining provinces to season their new %0awines with resin : sometimes, too, they season them with old %0awine-lees or vinegar.^- They make various medicaments, also, %0afor this purpose with the must itself. They boil it down till %0ait becomes quite sweet, and has lost a considerable portion of %0aits strength ; though thus prepared, they say it will never last %0abeyond a single year. In some places they boil down the %0amust till it becomes sapa," and then mix it with their wines %0afor the purpose of modifying their harshness. Both for %0athese kinds of wines, as, indeed, all others, they always employ %0avessels which have themselves received an inner coat of pitch ; %0athe method of preparing them will be set forth in a succeeding %0aBook.i* %0a%0aCHAP. 25. (20.) — PITCH and hesin. %0a%0aOf the trees from which pitch and resin distil, there are %0asome which grow in the East, and others in Europe : the pro- %0avince of Asia,^^ which lies between the two, has also some of %0aboth kinds. In the East, the very best commodity of this %0akind, and of the finest quality, is that produced by the tere- %0abinth,^^ and, next to it, that from the lentisk," which is also %0aknown as the mastich. The next in quality to these is the juice %0aof the cypress,^^ being of a more aci'id flavour than any other. %0a%0a'1 See B. xxiii. c. 24, and B. xxxvi. c. 48. %0a%0a^'^ A process very likely, as Fee remarks, to turn the wines speedily to %0avinegar. %0a%0a13 Down to one-third.

The Arabian resin is of a %0apale colour, has an acrid smell, and its fumes are stifling to %0athose employed in boiling it. That of Judaea is of a harder %0anature, and has a stronger smell than that from the terebinth'' %0aeven. The Syrian - resin has all the appearance of Attic %0ahoney, but that of Cyprus is superior to any other ; it is the %0acolour of honey, and is of a soft, fleshy nature. The resin of %0aColophon^* is yellower than the other varieties, but when %0apounded it turns white; it has a stifling smell, for which %0areason the perfumers do not employ it. Tliat prepared in %0aAsia from the produce of the pitch-tree is very white, and is %0aknown by the name of " spagas." %0a%0aAll the resins are soluble in oil some persons are of opi- %0anion also that potters' chalk may be so dissolved I feel %0aashamed ^' to avow that the principal esteem in which the %0aresins arc held among us is as depilatories for taking the hair %0aoff men's bodies. %0a%0aThe method used for seasoning wines is to sprinkle pitch %0ain the must during the first fermentation, -which never lasts %0abeyond nine days at the most, so that a bouquet is imparted %0ato the wine,'^ with, in some degree, its own peculiar piquancy %0aof flavour. It is generally considered, that this is done most %0ae.Tectually by the use of raw flower'-" of resin, which imparts %0aa considerable degree of briskness to wine : W'hile, on the %0aother hand, it is thought that crapula^" itself, if mixed, tends %0a%0a"> See B. xiii. c. 11, and B. xvi. c. 21. Not the cedar of Lebanon, %0aprobably, wliich only gives a very small quantity of resin, but one of the %0ajunipers. %0a%0aFee suggests that this may have been the resin of the Arabian tere- %0abinth. %0a%0aSee B. xxiv. c. 22. %0a-- Perhaps from the Pistacia tercbinthns of Luuiteus. %0a-3 This was made from the terebinth : but the modern resin of Colophon %0ais extracted from varieties of the couiferaj. %0a" See li. xxiv. c. 22. %0a28 Earths are not soluble in oils. %0a27 As being a mark of extreme cSfeminacy. %0a%0aThe greater the quantity of alcohol, the more resin the wine would %0abe able to hold in solution. %0a%0aSee B. xvi. c. 22. ... , %0a%0a30 " Crapula" properly means hcad-aclic, and wliat is not uncommonly %0aknown as " seeduess."

It is in Liguria more particularl)-, and %0athe districts in the vicinity of the Padus, tliat the utility is %0arecognized of mixing crapula with the must, in doing which %0athe following rule is adopted : with wines of a strong and %0agenerous nature they mix a larger quantity, while with those %0athat are poor and thin they use it more sparingly. There are %0asome who would have the wine seasoned with both crapula %0aand flower of resin at the same time.^' Pitch too, when used %0afor this purpose, has much the same properties as must when %0aso employed. %0a%0aIn some places, the must is subject to a spontaneous fermen- %0atation a second time : when this unfortunately happens it loses %0aall its flavour, and then receives the name of " vappa,"^- a word %0awhich is applied as an opprobrious appellation even to worth- %0aless men of degenerate spirit : in vinegar, on the other hand, %0anotwithstanding its tart and acrid taste, there are very con- %0asiderable virtues, and without it we should miss many of the %0acomforts of civilized life. %0a%0aIn addition to what we have already stated, the treatment %0aand preparation of wines are the object of such remarkable at- %0atention, that we find some persons employing ashes, and others %0agypsum and other substances of which Ave have already %0aspoken, for the purpose of improving its condition : the ashcs,^' %0ahowever, of the shoots of vines or of the wood of the quercus, are %0ain general preferred for this purpose. It is recommended also, %0a%0athese effects, and hence obtained the name. This kind of wine was used %0aitself, as we see above, in seasoning the other kinds. Fee remarks, that %0aill reality resins have no such effect as imparting body to weak winus. %0a%0a31 The whole of this passage is hopelessly corrupt, and we can only %0aguess at the meaning. %0a%0a32 We have already stated that " vappa " is properly vinegar, which %0ahas been exposed to the air and has lost its flavour. In tliis fresh che- %0amical change, wliich he calls a second fermentation, the wine becomes %0avinegar ; and probably in the cases he mentions, for some peculiar reason, %0aits speedy transition to " vappa " could not be arrested. %0a%0a33 Mixed with water, it was the " posca," or common drink of the Roman %0asoldiers ; and it was used extensively both by Greeks and Eomans in their %0acooking, and at meals. %0a%0a3i In c. 24. %0a%0a35 By the mixture of ashes, Fee says, the wines would lose their colour, %0aand have a detestable alkaline flavour. %0a%0a%0a%0aCliiip. 2.3.] %0a%0a%0a%0aPITCH AND EESIN. %0a%0a%0a%0a267 %0a%0a%0a%0alo take sea-Tvatcr far out at sea, and to keep it in reserve/^ %0ato be employed lor this purpose : at all events, it ought to be %0ataken up in the night and during the summer solstice, -while %0athe north-east wind is blowing ; but if taken at the time of %0athe vintage, it should be boiled before being used. %0a%0aThe pitch most highly esteemed in Italy for preparing %0avessels for storing wine, is that -which comes from Eruttium. %0aIt is made from the resin that distils from the pitch-tree ; that %0aAvhich is used in Spain is held in but little est(;em, being the %0aproduce of the -wild pine ; it is bitter, dry, and of a disagree- %0aable smell. While speaking of the -wild trees in a succeeding %0aliook," we shall make mention of the different varieties of pitch, %0aand the methods used in preparing it. The defects in resin, %0abesides those which we have already mentioned, area certain %0adegree of acridity, or a peculiar smoky flavour, while the great %0afault in pitch is the being over-burnt. The ordinary test %0aof its goodness is a certain luminous appearance when broken %0ato pieces ; it ought to stick, too, to the teeth, with a pleasant, %0atart flavour. %0a%0aIn Asia, the pitch which is most esteemed is that of Mount %0aIda, in Greece of Pieria; but Virgil^^ gives the preference to %0athe Narycian*" pitch. The more careful makers mix with %0atlie wine black mastich, which comes from Pontus," and resem- %0ables bitumen in appearance, as also iris root and oil. As to %0acoating the vessels with Avax, it has been found that the wine %0ais apt to turn acid it is a better plan to put wine in vessels %0athat have held vinegar, than in those wliich have previously %0acontained sweet wine or mulsum. Cato'''' recommends that %0awines should be got up — concinnari is his word — by putting %0aof lie-ashes boiled down with defrutum, one-fortieth part to the %0aculeus, or else a pound and a half of salt, with pounded %0amarble as well : he makes mention of sulphur also, but only gives %0athe very last place to resin.

VINEGAE LEES OF WINE. %0a%0aIt is a peculiarity of wine, among the liquids, to become %0amouldy, or else to turn to vinegar. There are whole volumes %0awhich treat of the various methods of preventing this. %0a%0aThe lees of wine when dried will take fire and burn without %0athe addition of fuel : the ashes so produced have very much the %0anature of nitre,*" and similar virtues ; the more so, indeed, the %0amore unctuous they are to the touch. %0a%0aCHAP. 27. (21.) — WINE- VESSELS WINE-CELLAllS. %0a%0aThe various methods of keeping and storing wines in the %0acellar are very different. In the vicinity of the Alps, they put %0atheir wines in wooden vessels hooped around during their %0acold winters, they even keep lighted fires, to protect the wines %0afrom the effects of the cold. It is a singular thing to men- %0ation, but still it has been occasionally seen, that these vessels %0ahave burst asunder, and there has stood the wine in frozen %0amasses ; a miracle almost, as it is not ordinarily the nature of %0awine to freeze, cold having only the effect of benumbing it. %0aIn more temperate climates, they place their wines in dolia,^' %0awhich they bury in the earth, either covering them entirelj' or %0ain part, according to the temperature. Sometimes, again, they %0aexpose their wines in the open air, while at others they are %0aplaced beneath sheds for protection from the atmosphere. %0a%0aThe second " squeezings.'' %0a%0aIf the wine is turning to vinegar, suhacetate of lead will be formed. %0aThey are tartrates, and have no affinity at all with nitre. %0aCasks, in fact, similar to those used in France at the present day. In %0aSpain they use earthen jars and the skins of animals. %0a^ Oblong earthen vessels, used as vats. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 27.] %0a%0a%0a%0a"W!>-£-VES8EL3. %0a%0a%0a%0a269 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe following are among the rules given for the proper %0amanagement of wines : — One side of the wine-cellar, or, at %0aall events, the windows, ought to face the north-east, or at least %0adue east. All dunghills and roots of trees, and everj-thihg of %0aa repulsive smell, ought to be kept at as great a distance as %0apossible, wine being very apt to contract an odour. Fig-trees %0atoo, either wild or cultivated, ought not to be planted in the %0avicinity. Intervals should also be left between the vessels, %0ain order to prevent infection, in case of any of them turning %0abad, wine being remarkably apt to become tainted. The %0ashape, too, of the vessels is of considerable importance : those %0atliat are broad and bellying " are not so good.*'- "NYe find it re- %0acommended too, to pitch them immediately after the rising of %0atlie Dog-star, and then to wash them either with sea or salt %0awater, after which they should be sprinkled with the ashes of %0atree-shoots or else with potters' earth ; they ought then to be %0acleaned out, and perfumed with myrrh, a thing which ought %0ato be frequently done to the wine-cellars as well. "Weak, %0athin wines should be kept" in dolia sunk in the ground, while %0athose in which the stronger ones are kept should be more ex- %0aposed to the air. Tlie vessels ought on no account to be entirely %0afilled, room being left for seasoning, by mixing either raisin %0awine or else defrutum flavoured with saflTron ; old pitch and %0asapa are sometimes used for the same purpose. Tlie lids, too, %0auf the dolia ought to be seasoned in a similar manner, with %0athe addition of mastich and Bruttian pitch. %0a%0aIt is strongly recommended never to open the vessels, ex- %0acept in fine weather ; nor yet while a south wind is blowing, %0aoV at a full moon. %0a%0aThe flower" of wine when white is looked upon as a good %0asign ; but when it is red, it is bad, unless that should happen %0ato be the colour of the wine. The vessels, too, should not be %0ahot to the touch, nor should the covers throw out a sort of %0asweat. "When wine very soon flowers on the surface and %0aemits an odour, it is a sign that it will not keep. %0a%0aAs to defrutum and sapa, it is recommended to commence %0aboiling them when there is no moon to be seen, or, m other %0a%0a»i "Ventruosa."

To promote drinking, Ave find that even poisonous %0amixtures have been invented, and some men are known to %0atake a dose of hemlock before they begin to drink, that they %0amay have the fear of death before them to make them take %0atheir wine others, again, take powdered pumice ''^ for the %0a%0a^* Vessels of lead are never used for this purpose at the present day ; as %0athat metal would oxidize too rapidly, and hquids would have great diffi- %0aculty in coming to a boil.

Others there are, again, who can- %0anot wait till tliey have got to the banqueting couch,^'^ no, not %0aso much as till they have got their shirt on,"^'* but all naked %0aand panting as they are, the instant they leave the bath they %0aseize hold of large vessels filled with wine, to show off, as it %0awere, their miglity powers, and so gulp down the whole of the %0acontents onlj- to vomit them up again the very next moment. %0aThis they will repeat, too, a second and even a third time, %0ajust as though they had only been begotten for the purpose of %0awasting wine, and as if that liquor could not be thrown away %0awithout having first passed through the human body. It is %0ato encourage habits such as these that we have introduced the %0aathletic exercises"' of other countries, such as rolling in the %0amud, for instance, and throwing the arras back to show off a %0abrawny neck and chest. Of all these exercises, thirst, it is %0asaid, is the chief and primary object. %0a%0aAnd then, too, what vessels are employed for holding wine I %0acarved all over with the representations of adulterous intrigues, %0aas if, in fact, drunkenness itself was not sufficiently capable of %0ateaching us lessons of lustfulness. Thus we see wines quaffed %0aout of impurities, and inebriety invited even by the hope of a %0areward, — invited, did I say ? — may the gods forgive me for %0asaying so, purchased outright. We find one person induced %0ato drink upon the. condition that he shall have as much to eat %0aas he has previously drunk, while another has to quaff as %0amany cups as he has thrown points on the dice.

And how many a man lias met his death in this fashion ! %0aIndeed, it has become quite a common proverb, that " in wine' %0athere is truth." %0a%0aShould ho, however, fortunately escape all these dangers, %0athe drunkard never beholds the rising sun, by which his life %0aof drinking is made all the shorter. From wine, too, comes %0athat pallid hue,** those drooping eyelids, those sore eyes, those %0atremulous hands, unable to hold with steadiness the over- %0aflowing vessel, condign punishment in the shape of sleep agi- %0atated b)' Furies during the restless night, and, the supreme %0areward of inebriety, those dreams of monstrous lustfulness and %0aof forbidden delights. Then on the next day there is the breath %0areeking of the wine-cask, and a nearly total obliviousness of %0aeverything, from the annihilation of the powers of the memory. %0aAnd this, too, is what they call " seizing the moments of lilel''" %0awhereas, in realitj^, while other men lose the day that lias gone %0abefore, the drinker has already lost the one that is to come. %0a%0aThey fii-st began, in the reign of Tiberius Claudius, some %0aforty years ago, to drink fasting, and to take whets of wine %0abefore meals; an outlandish*^ fashion, however, and only pa- %0atronized by physicians who wished to recommend themselves %0aby the introduction of some novelty or other. %0a%0aIt is in the exercise of their drinking powers that the Par- %0athians look for their share of fame, and it was in this that %0aAlcibiades among the Greeks earned his great repute. Among %0aourselves, too, Novellius Torquatus of Mediolanum, a man %0awho held all the honours of the state from the prefecture to the %0apro-consulate, could drink off three congii*^ at a single draught, %0aa feat from which he obtained the surname of "Tricon- %0agius :" this he did before the eyes of the Emperor Tiberius, %0aand to his extreme surprise and astonishment, a man who in %0ahis old age was very morose,™ and indeed very cruel in gene- %0aral ; though in his younger days he himself had been too %0amuch addicted to wine. Indeed it was owing to that recom- %0amendation that it was generally thought that L.

But it is not to be wond(Ted at that %0aCicero was desirous in this respect to eclipse the fame of M. %0aAntonius, the murderer of his father; a man who had, before %0athe time of the younger Cicero, shown himself so extremely %0a• anxious to maintain tlie superiority in this kind of qualifica- %0ation, that he had even gone so far as to publish a book upon %0athe subject of his own drunkenness.'* During in this work to %0aspeak in his own defence, he has proved very satisfactorily, to %0amy thinking, how many were the evils he had iuliicted upon %0athe world through this same vice of drunkeuuess.

LIQUORS WITH THE STRENGTH OF WINE MADE FROM %0a%0aWATER AND CORN. %0a%0aThe people of the Western world have also their intoxi- %0acating drinks, made from corn steeped in water.'* These %0abeverages are prepared in different waj^s throughout Gaul %0aand the pro\-inces of Spain ; under different names, too, %0athough in their results they are the same. The Spanish %0aprovinces have even taught us the fact that these liquors are %0acapable of being kept till they have attained a considerable %0aage. Egypt,'' too, has invented for its use a very similar beve- %0arage made from corn ; indeed, in no part of the world is %0adrunkenness ever at a loss. And then, besides, they take these %0adrinks unmixed, and do not dilute them with water, the way %0athat wine is modified ; and yet, by Hercules ! one really might %0ahave supposed that there the earth produced nothing but com %0afor the people's use. Alas! what wondrous skill, and yet %0ahow misplaced ! means have absolutely been discovered for %0agetting drunk upon water even. %0a%0aThere are two liquids that are peculiarly grateful to the %0ahuman body, Mine within and oil without; both of thera %0athe produce of trees, and most excellent in their respective %0akinds.

ITS MODE OF %0a%3c %0a%3c FUUCTIFICATIOX. %0a%3c %0a%3c Those which have been hitherto mentioned, are, ncarlj' all %0a%3c of thera, exotic trees, wliich it is impossible to rear in any %0a%3c other than their native soil, and which are not to be naturalized %0a%3c in strange countries.' It is now for us to. speak of the more %0a%3c ordinary kinds, of all of which Italy may be looked upon %0a%3c as more particularly the parent.^ Those who are well ac- %0a%3c quainted with the subject, must only bear in mind that for %0a%3c the present we content ourselves with merely stating the %0a%3c different varieties of these trees, and not the mode of cultivating %0a%3c them, although there is no doubt that the characteristics of a %0a%3c tree depend very considerably upon its cultivation. At this %0a%3c fact I cannot sufficiently express my astonishment, that of %0a%3c some trees all memorj' has utterly perished, and that the %0a%3c very names of some, of which we find various authors making %0a%3c mention, have wholly disappeared.^ And yet w^ho does not %0a%3c readily admit that now, when intercommunications have been %0a%3c opened between all parts of the world, thanks to the majestic %0a%3c sway of the lloman empire, civilization and the arts of life %0a%3c have made a rapid progress, owing to the interchange of com- %0a%3c modities and the common enjoyment by all of the blessings of %0a%3c peace, while at the same time a multitude of objects which %0a%3c %0a%3c ^ This must be understood -with considerable modification — many -of %0a%3c the tropical trees and plants have been naturalized, and those of America %0a%3c more particularly, in Europe. %0a%3c %0a%3c 2 He is probably wrong in looking upon the vine as indigenous to Italy. %0a%3c It was known in very early times in Egypt and Greece, and it is now %0a%3c generally considered that it is indigenous throughout the tract that %0a%3c stretches to tlie south, from the the mountains of Mazandiran on the Cas- %0a%3c pian to the sliorcs of the Persian Gulf and the Indian Sea, and eastward %0a%3c through Khorassan and Cabul to the base of the Himalayas. %0a%3c %0a%3c 3 The art of printing, Fee remarks, utterly precludes the recurrence of %0a%3c such a fact as tlijs. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 216 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c plint's natueal history. [Book XIV. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c formerly lay concealed, are now revealed for our indiscriminati %0a%3c %0a%3c Still, by Hercules I at the present day there are none to he %0a%3c found who have any acquaintance witli much that has been %0a%3c handed down to us by the ancient writers; so much more %0a%3c comprehensive was the diligent research of our forefathers, or %0a%3c else so much more happily employed was their industry. It %0a%3c is a thousand years ago since Hesiod,' at the very dawn, so to %0a%3c say, of literature, first gave precepts for the guidance of the %0a%3c agriculturist, an example which has since been followed by no %0a%3c small number of writers. Hence have originated considerable %0a%3c labours for ourselves, seeing that we have not only to enquire %0a%3c into the discoveries of modem times, but to ascertain as well %0a%3c what was known to the ancients, and this, too, in the verj- %0a%3c midst of that oblivion which the heedlessness of the present %0a%3c day has so greatly tended to generate. \Yhat causes then are %0a%3c we to assign for this lethargy, other than those feelings which %0a%3c we find actuating the public in general throughout all the %0a%3c world ? New manners and usages, no doubt, have now como %0a%3c into vogue, and the minds of men arc occupied with subjects %0a%3c of a totally different nature ; the arts of avarice, in fact, are %0a%3c the only ones that are now cultivated. %0a%3c %0a%3c In days gone by, the sway and the destinies of states were %0a%3c bounded by their own narrow limits, and consequently the %0a%3c genius of the people was similarly circumscribed as well, %0a%3c through a sort of niggardliness that was thus displayed by %0a%3c Fortune : hence it became with them a matter of absolute %0a%3c necessity to employ the advantages of the understanding : %0a%3c kings innumerable received the homage of the arts, and in %0a%3c making a display of the extent of their resources, gave the %0a%3c highest rank to those arts, entertaining the opinion that it was %0a%3c through, them that they should ensure immortality. Hence it %0a%3c was that due rewards, and the various works of civilization, were %0a%3c displayed in such vast abundance in those times. For these %0a%3c later ages, the enlarged boundaries of the habitable world, %0a%3c and the vast extent of our empire, have been a positive injury. %0a%3c Since the Censor has been chosen for the extent of his property, %0a%3c since the judge has been selected according to the magnitude of %0a%3c his fortune, since it has become the fashion to consider that %0a%3c %0a%3c * In allusion to his poem, the " "Works and Days," the prototype of %0a%3c Virgil's Georgics. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 2.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c THE >'ATUUE OP THE TINE. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 217 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c nothing reflects a higher merit upon the magistrate and the %0a%3c general than a large estate, since the being destitute of heirs' %0a%3c has begun to confer upon persons the very highest power and %0a%3c influence, since legacy-hunting^ has become the most lucrative %0a%3c of all professions, and since it has been considered tliat the %0a%3c only real pleasures are those of possessing, all the true enjoy- %0a%3c ments of life have been utterly lost sight of, and all those arts %0a%3c which have derived the name of liberal, from liberty,^ that %0a%3c greatest blessing of life, have come to deserve the contrary %0a%3c appellation, servility alone being the passport to profit. %0a%3c %0a%3c This servility each one has his own peculiar way of making %0a%3c most agreeable, and of putting in practice in reference to %0a%3c others, the motives and the hopes of all tending to the one %0a%3c great object, the acquisition of wealth : indeed, we may every- %0a%3c where behold men even of naturally excellent qualities pre- %0a%3c ferring to foster the vicious inclinations of others rather than %0a%3c cultivate tlieir own talents. We may therefore conclude, by %0a%3c Hercules ! that pleasure has now begun to live, and that life, %0a%3c truly 80 called, has ceased to be.® As to ourselves, however, %0a%3c we shall continue our researches into matters now lost in ob- %0a%3c livion, nor shall we be deterred from pursuing our task by the %0a%3c trivial nature^ of some of our details, a consideration which %0a%3c has in no way influenced us in our description of the animal %0a%3c world. And yet we find that Virgil, that most admirable %0a%3c poet, has allowed this to influence him, in his omission to enlarge %0a%3c upon the beauties of the garden ; for, happy and graceful poet %0a%3c as he is, he has only culled what we may call the flower of %0a%3c his subject: indeed, we find that he has only named'" in all %0a%3c some fifteen varieties of the grape, three of the olive, the same %0a%3c number of the pear, and the citron of Assyria, and has passed %0a%3c over the rest in silence altogether, %0a%3c %0a%3c (2). With what then ought we to begin in preference to the %0a%3c vine, the superiority in which has been so peculiarly con- %0a%3c %0a%3c ' He alludes to the legacy-hunters with which Rome abounded in his %0a%3c time.

In the city of Popu- %0a%3c lonium, we see a statue of Jupiter formed of the trunk of a %0a%3c single vino, which, has for ages remained proof against all %0a%3c decay ; and at Massilia, there is a patera made of the same %0a%3c wood. At Metapontum, the temple of Juno has long stood %0a%3c supported by pillars formed of the like material ; and even at %0a%3c the present day we ascend to the roof of the temple of Diana at %0a%3c Ephesus, by stairs constructed, it is said, of the trunk of a single %0a%3c vine, that was brought from Cj^prus ; the vines of that island %0a%3c often attaining a most remarkable size. There is not a wood in %0a%3c existence of a more lasting nature than this ; I am strongly %0a%3c inclined, however, to be of opinion that the material of which %0a%3c these various ai'ticles were constructed was the wild Anne. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 3. THE NATUEE OF THE GRAPE, AND THE CULTIVATION OP %0a%3c %0a%3c THE VINE. %0a%3c %0a%3c The cultivated vine is kept down by pruning every year, %0a%3c and all the strength of the tree is drawn as much as possible %0a%3c into the shoots, or else thrown downwards to the sets indeed, %0a%3c it is only allowed to expand with the view of ensuring an %0a%3c abundant supply of juice, a result which is obtained in various %0a%3c modes according to the peculiarities of the climate and the %0a%3c nature of the soil. In Campania they attach'''' the vine to the %0a%3c poplar : embracing the tree to which it is thus wedded, the %0a%3c vine grasps the branches with its amorous arms, and as it %0a%3c climbs, holds on with its knotted trunk, till it has reached the %0a%3c very summit ; the height being sometimes so stupendous that %0a%3c the vintager when hired is wont to stipulate for his funeral %0a%3c pile and a grave at the owner's expense. The vine keeps %0a%3c %0a%3c " Theophrastus reckons it among the trees ; Columella, B. ii., considers %0a%3c it to occupy a middle position between a tree and a shrub. Horace, 13. i. %0a%3c Ode 18, calls it a tree, "arbor.' %0a%3c %0a%3c ^■^ Or "layers," " propagines." %0a%3c %0a%3c '3 Nubunt, properly " marry." This is still done in Naples, and other %0a%3c ports of Italy. The use of vine stays there are unknown. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 3.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c THE CULTIVATION OF THE VINK, %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 21.0 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c continually on the increase, and it is quite impossible to sepa- %0a%3c rate the two, or rather, I may say, to tear them asunder. %0a%3c Valerianus Cornelius has regarded it as one of the most re- %0a%3c markable facts that could be transmitted to posterity, that %0a%3c single vines have been known to surround villas and country- %0a%3c houses with their shoots and creeping tendrils ever on the %0a%3c stretch. At Eome, in the porticoes of Livia, a single vine, %0a%3c with its leaf- clad trellises, protects with its shade the walks %0a%3c in the open air; the fruit of it yields twelve amphorae of %0a%3c must.'* %0a%3c %0a%3c Everywhere we find the vine overtopping the elm even, %0a%3c and we read that Cineas,'** the ambassador of King Pyrrhus, %0a%3c when admiring the great height of the vines at Arici;!, %0a%3c wittily making allusion to the peculiar rough taste of wine, %0a%3c remarked that it was with very good reason that they had %0a%3c hung the parent of it on so lofty a gibbet. There is a tree %0a%3c in that part of Italy which lies beyond the Padus," known %0a%3c as the " rumpotinus," or sometimes by the name of "opu- %0a%3c lus," the broad circular'^ storeys of which are covered with %0a%3c vines, whose branches wind upwards in a serpentine form to %0a%3c the part where the boughs finally divide," and then, throw- %0a%3c ing out their tendrils, disperse them in every direction among %0a%3c the straight and finger-like twigs which project from the %0a%3c branches. There are vines also, about as tall as a man of %0a%3c moderate height, which are supported by props, and, as they %0a%3c throw out their bristling tendrils, form whole vineyards : while %0a%3c others, again, in their inordinate love for climbing, combined %0a%3c with skill on the part of the proprietor, will cover even the %0a%3c very centre'® of the court-yard with their shoots and foliage. %0a%3c %0a%3c '* "Mustum."

Sillig suggests a new %0a%3c reading, which, unsupported as it is by any of the MSS., can only be %0a%3c regarded as fanciful, and perhaps as a very slight improvement on tlie %0a%3c attempts to obtain a solution of the difficulty. Pliny's main object seems %0a%3c to be to contrast the vines that entwine round poles and_ rise perpendicu- %0a%3c larly with those that creep horizontally. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 220 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Flint's natuba-L iiisxonr. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XIV. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c So numerous are the varieties of the vine which even Italy %0a%3c alone presents. %0a%3c %0a%3c In some of the provinces the vine is able to stand of itself %0a%3c without anything to support it, drawing in its bending %0a%3c branches, and making up in its thickness for its stunted size. %0a%3c In other places, again, the winds will not allow of this mode of %0a%3c culture, as in Africa, for instance, and various parts of the %0a%3c province of Gallia Narbonensis. These vines, being prevented %0a%3c from growing beyond the first branches, and hence always %0a%3c retaining a resemblance to those plants which stand in need %0a%3c of the hoe, traU along the ground just like them, and every %0a%3c here and there suck^® up the juices from the earth to fill their %0a%3c grapes : it is in consequence of this, that in the interior of Africa %0a%3c the clusters^ are knowTi to exceed the body of an infant in size. %0a%3c The wine of no country' is more acid than those of Africa, but %0a%3c there is nowhere to be found a grape that is more agreeable %0a%3c for its firmness, a circumstance which may very probably have %0a%3c given rise to its name of the "hard grape."^' As to the %0a%3c varieties of the grape, although they are rendered innumerable %0a%3c by the size, the colour, and the flavour of the berry, they are %0a%3c multiplied even still more by the wines that they produce. %0a%3c In one part they are lustrous with a rich piu-ple colour, while %0a%3c in another, again, they glow with a rosy tint, or else are glossy %0a%3c with their verdant hue. The grapes that are merely white %0a%3c or black are the common sorts. The bumastus" swells out %0a%3c in form like a breast, while that known as the " dactylus," ^' %0a%3c has a berry of remarkable length. Nature, too, displays such %0a%3c varieties in these productions of hers, that small grapes are %0a%3c often to be found adhering to the largest vines, but of sur- %0a%3c passing sweetness ; they are known by the name of " lep- %0a%3c torragae."'^ Some, again, will keep throughout the winter, if %0a%3c care is taken to hang them to the ceUing^ with a string ; %0a%3c %0a%3c " By throwing out fresli shoots every here and there.

Some grapes receive from the smoke of the black- %0a%3c smith's forge that remarkable flavour which it is also known %0a%3c to impart to wines : it was the high name of the Emperor %0a%3c Tiberius that brought into such great repute the grapes that %0a%3c had been smoked in the smithies of Africa. Before his time %0a%3c the highest rank at table was assigned to the grapes of Rhie- %0a%3c tia,*' and to those growing in the territory of Verona. %0a%3c %0a%3c Raisins of the sun have the name of "passi," from having %0a%3c been submitted-^ to the influence of the sun. It is not un- %0a%3c common to preserve grapes in must, and so make them drunk %0a%3c with their own juices; while there are some that are all the %0a%3c sweeter for being placed in must after it has been boiled ; %0a%3c others, again, are left to hang on the parent tree till a new %0a%3c crop has made its appearance, by which time they have be- %0a%3c come as clear and as transparent^' as glass. Astringent %0a%3c pitch, if poured upon the footstalk of the grape, will impart %0a%3c to it all that body and that firmness which, when placed iu %0a%3c dolia or amphorte, it gives to wine. More recently, too, there %0a%3c has been discovered a vine which produces a fruit that imparts %0a%3c to its wine a strong flavour of pitch : it is the famous grape %0a%3c that confers such celebrity on the territory of Vienne,^° and of %0a%3c which several varieties have recently enriched the territories %0a%3c of the Arverni, the Sequani, and the Helvii : it was un- %0a%3c known in the time of the poet Virgil, who has now been dead %0a%3c these ninety years.'- %0a%3c %0a%3c In addition to these particulars, need I make mention of the %0a%3c fact that the vinc^^ has been introduced into the camp and %0a%3c %0a%3c 2" We have no corresponding; word for the Latin " dolium."

(2.) — NINETY-ONE VAEIETIES OF THE VINE. %0a%3c %0a%3c Democritus, who has declared that he was acquainted with %0a%3c every variety of the grape knoNvoi in Greece, is the only person %0a%3c who has been of opinion that every kind could be enumerated ; %0a%3c but, on the other hand, the rest of the authors have stated that %0a%3c they are quite innumerable^* and of infinite extent, an assertion %0a%3c the truth of which will be more evident, if we only consider %0a%3c the vast number of wines. I shall not attempt, then, to speak %0a%3c of every kind of vine, but only of those that are the most re- %0a%3c markable, seeing that the varieties are very nearly as number- %0a%3c less as the districts in which they grow. It will suffice, then, %0a%3c to point out those which are the most remarkable among the %0a%3c vines, or else are peculiar for some wonderful property. %0a%3c %0a%3c The very highest rank is given to the Aminean*' grape, on %0a%3c %0a%3c The reading " elatas," has been ndopted. If "lentas" is retained, %0a%3c it may mean, " promotion, slow though it be," for the word " aquila" %0a%3c was often used to denote the rank of the " primipilus," who had the %0a%3c charge of tlie eagle of the legion. %0a%3c %0a%3c ^= Because it was the privilege solely of those soldiers who were Roman %0a%3c citizens to be beaten witli the vine sapling. %0a%3c %0a%3c 35 He alludes to the " vinea" used in besieging towns ; the first notion %0a%3c of which was derived from the leafy roof afforded by the vines when creeping %0a%3c on the trellis over-head. It was a moveable machine, affording a roof %0a%3c under which the besiegers protected themselves against darts, stones, fire, %0a%3c and other missiles. Raw hides or wet cloths constituted the uppermost %0a%3c layer. %0a%3c %0a%3c 37 See B. xxiii. c. 19. %0a%3c %0a%3c '8 Many years ago, tliere were in the gardens of the Luxembourg one %0a%3c thousand four hundred varieties of the French grape, and even then there %0a%3c were many not to be found there; while, at the same time, it was con- %0a%3c sidered that the French kinds did not form more than one-twentieth part %0a%3c of the species known in Europe. %0a%3c %0a%3c This vine was said to be of Grecian origin, and to have been con- %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 4.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c VAUIETIES OF THE YINE. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 223 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c account of the body and durability of its wine, which, improves %0a%3c vrith old age. There are five varieties of the Aminean grape ; %0a%3c of these, the smaller germana, or " sister" grape, has a smaller %0a%3c b(Try than the rest, and flowers more strongly, being able to %0a%3c bear up against rain and tempestuous weather ; a thing that %0a%3c is not the case with the larger germana, though it is less ex- %0a%3c posed to danger when attached to a tree than when supported %0a%3c only by a trellis. Another kind, again, has obtained the %0a%3c name of the " gcmella," or " twin" grape, because the clusters %0a%3c always grow*" in couples : the flavour of the wine is extremely %0a%3c rough, but it is remarkable for its strength. Of these several %0a%3c varieties the smaller one suff'ers from the south wind, but re- %0a%3c ceives nutriment from all the others, upon Mount Vesuvius, %0a%3c for instance, and the hills of Surrentum : in the other parts of %0a%3c Italy it is never grown except attached to trees. The fifth %0a%3c kind is that known as the lanata, or "woolly" grape; so that %0a%3c we need not be surprised at the wool-bearing trees'*^ of the %0a%3c Seres or the Indians, for this grape is covered with a woolly %0a%3c down of remarkable thickness. It is the first of the Ami- %0a%3c nean vines that ripens, but the grape decays with remarkable %0a%3c rapidity. %0a%3c %0a%3c The second rank belongs to the vines of Momentum,"* the %0a%3c wood of which is red, from which circumstance the vines have %0a%3c received from some the name of " rubeUa?." The grapes of %0a%3c this vine produce less wine than usual, in consequence of the %0a%3c extraordinary quantity of husk and lees they throw ofi" : but %0a%3c the vine is remarkably strong, is well able to stand the frost, %0a%3c and is apt to receive more detriment from drought than from %0a%3c rain, from heat than from cold ; hpncc it is that those are %0a%3c looked upon as the best that are grown in cold and moist %0a%3c localities. That variety which has the smallest grape is con- %0a%3c %0a%3c v(!ycd by a Thcssalian tribe to Italy, where it was grown at Aminea, a %0a%3c village m the Falcrnian district of Campania. It is supposed to have %0a%3c been°the same as the ffros plant of the Frtiich. The varieties mentioned %0a%3c by Pliny seem not to have been recognized by the moderns. %0a%3c i» Fee docs not give credit to this statement. %0a%3c %0a%3c *i In allusion to the cotton-trec, or else the mulberry leaves covered %0a%3c with the cocoons of the silkworm.

This grape, too, is covered in %0a%3c its young state with a kind of down ; the main diiForence be- %0a%3c tween the two varieties is, that the one ripens more rapidly %0a%3c than the other, though this last ripens with considerable %0a%3c quickness. A cold locality is not at all hurtful to them, %0a%3c although there is no grape that ripens sooner : these grapes, %0a%3c however, very soon rot in the rain. The wines produced by %0a%3c this grape are sweet at fii'st, but contract a rough flavour in %0a%3c the course of years. This vine is cultivated more than any %0a%3c other in Etruria. Thus far we have made mention of the %0a%3c more celebrated vines among those which are peculiar and in- %0a%3c digenous to Italy ; the rest have been introduced from Chios %0a%3c or Thasos. %0a%3c %0a%3c The small Greek" grape is not inferior to the Aminean for %0a%3c the excellence of its quality : the berry is remarkably thin- %0a%3c skinned, and the cluster so extremely small, that it is not %0a%3c worth while cultivating it, except on a soil of remarkable %0a%3c richness. The eugenia,^" so called from its high qualities, has %0a%3c been introduced into the Alban territory from the hills of %0a%3c Tauromenium it is found, however, to thrive only there, %0a%3c for if transplanted elsewhere it degenerates immediately : in %0a%3c fact, there is in some vines so strong an attachment to their %0a%3c native soil, that they leave behind them all their high repute, %0a%3c and are never transplanted in their full entirety. This is the %0a%3c case, too, with the Ehaetian and the Allobrogian grapes, of %0a%3c Avhich we have made mention above as the pitch-flavoured^" %0a%3c grape; these are justly deemed excellent in their own coun- %0a%3c %0a%3c " From " apis," a " bee."

Still, %0a%3c liowever, in consequence of their remarkable fertility, they %0a%3c make up for quality by abundance : the eugenia thrives in %0a%3c spots which are scorching hot, the Rhsetian vine in places of a %0a%3c more moderate temperature, and the Allobrogian in cold, ex- %0a%3c posed situations, the fruit being of a black colour, and ripened %0a%3c by the agency of frost. %0a%3c %0a%3c The wines produced from the vines of which we have %0a%3c hitherto made mention, even though the grapes are black, %0a%3c become, all of them, when old, of a white " complexion. The %0a%3c other vines are of no note in particular, though sometimes, %0a%3c thanks to some peciiliarity either in the climate or the soil, %0a%3c the wines produced from them attain a mature old age ; such, %0a%3c for instance, as the Fecenian*" vine, and the Biturigian,*' which %0a%3c blossoms at the same time with it, but has not so many grapes. %0a%3c The blossoms of these last-mentioned vines are not liable to %0a%3c receive injury, both because they are naturally but transi- %0a%3c tory, and have the power of resisting the action of both wind %0a%3c and storm ; still, however, those that grow in cold spots are %0a%3c considered superior to those produced in a warm site, and those %0a%3c found in moist places superior to those grown in dry, thirsty %0a%3c localities. %0a%3c %0a%3c The vine known as the "visula" "2 * * * * more %0a%3c than abundance of fruit, being unable to endure the extreme %0a%3c variations of the atmosphere, though it is very well able to %0a%3c stand a continuation of either cold or heat.

Of the two %0a%3c sorts of helvolae, the black is the one generally preferred : they %0a%3c both of them produce every other year, but the wine is best %0a%3c when the vintage has been less abundant. %0a%3c %0a%3c The vine that is known as the " prccia" " is also divided %0a%3c into two varieties, distinguished by the size of the grape. %0a%3c These vines produce a vast quantity of wood, and the grape is %0a%3c very good for preserving in jars the leaves are similar in %0a%3c appearance to that of parsley.^® The people of Dyrrhachium %0a%3c hold in high esteem the vine known as the " basilica," the %0a%3c same which in Spain is called the " cocolobis."" The grapes %0a%3c of this vine grow in thin clusters, and it can stand great heat, %0a%3c and the south winds. The wine produced from it is apt to fly %0a%3c to the head the produce of the vine is very large. The %0a%3c people in Spain distinguish two kinds of this vine, the one %0a%3c with the oblong, the other with the round grape ; they gather %0a%3c this fruit the very last of all. The sweeter the cocolobis is, %0a%3c the more it is valued ; but even if it has a rough taste, the wine %0a%3c will become sweet by keeping, while, on the other hand, that %0a%3c which was sweet at first, will acquire a certain roughness ; it %0a%3c is in this last state that the wine is thought to rival that of %0a%3c Alba.°' It is said that the juice of this grape is remarkably %0a%3c efficacious when drunk as a specific for diseases of the bladder. %0a%3c %0a%3c ''^ By this name it would be understood that they were of an inter- %0a%3c mediate colour between rose and white, a not uncommon colour in the %0a%3c grape. Pliny, however, says otherwise, and he is supported by Columella. %0a%3c %0a%3c ^ C. Bauhin took this to mean one of the garden currant trees, the %0a%3c Ribcs uva crispa of Linnasus, daWed by Bauhin Grossularia simplici acino, %0a%3c or else Spinosa agrestis.

The word cocolab, according to some, meant %0a%3c cock's comb. It is mentioned as a Spanish word by Columella. %0a%3c %0a%3c 38 Dalechamps says, that a similar wine was made at ilontpellicr, and %0a%3c that it was called " piquardant." %0a%3c See B. xxiii. cc. 20, 21. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 4.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c VAEIETIEg OF THE VIJTE. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 227 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The " albuelis" ^ produces most of its fruit at the top of %0a%3c the tree, the visula at the bottom ; hence, when planted around %0a%3c the same tree, in consequence of these peculiarities in their %0a%3c nature, thej^ bear between them a two-fold crop. One of the %0a%3c black grape vines has been called the " inerticula," " though %0a%3c it might with more propriety have been styled the " sobria;'"^- %0a%3c the wine from it is remarkably good, and more particularly %0a%3c when old ; but though strong, it is productive of no ill effects, %0a%3c and, indeed, is the only wine that will not cause in- %0a%3c toxication. %0a%3c %0a%3c ^ The abundance of their produce again recommends other %0a%3c vines to us, and, in the first place, that known as the " helven- %0a%3c naca."^^ Of this vine there are two kinds ; the larger, which %0a%3c is by some called the "long" helvennaca, and the smaller %0a%3c kind, which is known as the " emarcum,"" not so prolific as %0a%3c the first, but producing a wine of more agreeable flavour ; it %0a%3c is distinguished by its rounded leaf, but they are both of %0a%3c them of slender make. It is requisite to place forks beneath %0a%3c these vines for the support of their branches, as otherwise it %0a%3c would be quite impossible for them to support the weight of %0a%3c their produce : they receive nutriment from the breezes that %0a%3c blow from the sea, and foggy weather is injurious to them. %0a%3c There is not one among the vines that manifests a greater %0a%3c aversion to Italy, for there it becomes comparatively leafless %0a%3c and stunted, and soon decays, while the wine which it produces %0a%3c there will not keep beyond the summer : no vine, however, %0a%3c thrives better in a poor soil. Groecinus, who has copied from %0a%3c the works of Coi-nelius Cclsus, gives it as his opinion that it is %0a%3c not that the nature of this vine is repugnant to the climate %0a%3c of Italy, but that it is the mode of cultivating it that is %0a%3c %0a%3c Probably from "albus," "white." Poinsinct thinks that it may %0a%3c have been so called from the Celtic word alb, or a/p, a mountain, and that %0a%3c it grew on elevated spots. This, however, is probably fanciful. %0a%3c %0a%3c Called by the Greeks afifOvarov, from its comparatively harmless %0a%3c qualities. %0a%3c ^- Or "sober" vine. %0a%3c %0a%3c «3 Hardouin says that in his time it was still cultivated abont Macerata, %0a%3c in the Roman States.

The Campanians, however, prefer to give it %0a%3c the name of " scircula," while others, again, call it " stacula." %0a%3c Tarracina has a vine known as the " numisiana;" it has no %0a%3c qualities of its own, but has characteristics just according to %0a%3c the nature of the soil in which it is planted : the wine, how- %0a%3c ever, if kept in the earthen casks '^^ of Surrentum, is remark- %0a%3c able for its goodness, that is to say, as far south as Vesuvius. %0a%3c On arriving in that district, we find the Murgentina,™ the very %0a%3c best among all those that come from Sicily.

The vine known as %0a%3c the " metica" lasts well for years, and offers a successful re- %0a%3c sistance to all changes of weather ; the grape is black, and the %0a%3c wine assumes a tawny hue when old. %0a%3c %0a%3c (3.) The varieties that have been mentioned thus far are %0a%3c those that are generally known ; the others belong to peculiar %0a%3c countries or individual localities, or else arc of a mixed nature, %0a%3c the produce of grafting. Thus the vine known as the " Tuder- %0a%3c nis,"'^ is peculiar to the districts of Etruria, and so too is the %0a%3c vine that bears the name of " Florentia." At Arretium the %0a%3c talpona, the etesiaca, and the consemina, are particularly ex- %0a%3c cellent.'* The talpona,'' which is a black grape, produces a %0a%3c pale, straw-coloured'** must ': the etesiaca" is apt to deceive; %0a%3c the more the wine it produces the better the quality, but it %0a%3c is a remarkable fact, that just as it has reached that point its %0a%3c fecundity ceases altogether. The consemina®" bears a black %0a%3c grape, but its wine will not keep, though the grape itself is %0a%3c a most excellent keeper ; it is gathered fifteen days later than %0a%3c any other kind of grape : this vine is very fruitful, but its %0a%3c grape is only good for eating. The leaves of this tree, like %0a%3c those of the wild vine, turn the colour of blood just before the %0a%3c fall : the same is the case also with some ®' other varieties, but %0a%3c it is a proof that they are of very inferior quality. %0a%3c %0a%3c The irtiola*- is a vine peculiar to Umbria and the terri- %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c es Hardouin thinks that it is so called from Tuder, a town of Etruria. %0a%3c See B. iii. c. 19. , ^ %0a%3c %0a%3c '15 Sillio' suo-o-csts that the reading here is eorrupt, and that i'liny %0a%3c means to say that the vine called Florentia is particularly excellent, and %0a%3c merely to state that the talpona, &c., are peculiar to Arretium : for, as %0a%3c he says, speaking directly afterwards in disparagement ot them ,^ it is not %0a%3c likely he would pronounce them "opima," of "first-rate quality." %0a%3c From " talpa," a " mole," in consequence of its black colour. %0a%3c %0a%3c ■9 rrtbably so called from the Etesian winds, which improved its growth. %0a%3c %0a%3c so Perhaps meaning "double-seeded." We may here remark, that the %0a%3c wines of Tuscany, though held in little esteem in ancient times, are highly %0a%3c esteemed at the present day, , - ^ , r xv r n %0a%3c %0a%3c 81 The leaves of most varieties turn red just before the faU. %0a%3c %0a%3c »2 And Baccius thinks that this is the kind from which the raisms of the %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 230 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c PLINt's UTATUBAL niSTOET. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XIV. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c tories of Mevania and Picenum, while the piimula" belong %0a%3c to Amiternum. In the same districts we find the vine called %0a%3c bannanica," which is yery deceptive, though the people are %0a%3c remarkably fond of its fruit. The municipal town of Pom- %0a%3c peii has given its name to the Pompeia/'' although it is to be %0a%3c found in greater abundance in the territory of Clusium. The %0a%3c Tiburina, also, is so called from the municipal town of Tibur, %0a%3c although it is in this district that they have lately discovered %0a%3c the grape known as the " oleaginea," from its strong resem- %0a%3c blance to an olive : this being the very last kind of grape that %0a%3c has been introduced. The Sabines and the Laurentes are the %0a%3c only people acquainted with the vinaciola.*'' As to the \4nes %0a%3c of Mount Gaurus,^ I am aware that, as they have been trans- %0a%3c planted from the Falernian territory, they bear the name of %0a%3c "Falemian:" but it is a fact that the Falemian vine, when %0a%3c transplanted, rapidly degenerates. Some persons, too, have %0a%3c made out a Tarentine variety, with a grape of remarkable %0a%3c sweetness : the grapes of the " capnios,"*^ the " bucconiatis,"^ %0a%3c and the " tarrupia," grow on the hills of Thurii, and are %0a%3c never gathered till after the frost commences. Pisae enjoys %0a%3c the Parian vine, and Mutina the prusinian,'' with a black %0a%3c grape, the wine of which turns pale within four years. It is %0a%3c a very remarkable thing, but there is a grape here that turns %0a%3c round with the sun, in its diurnal motion, a circumstance from %0a%3c which it has received the name of " streptos."^^ In Italy, the %0a%3c %0a%3c sun, common in Italy, and more particularly in the Valley of Bevagna, the %0a%3c Mevania of Pliny, are made. %0a%3c %0a%3c Perhaps from "pumilio," a dwarf. %0a%3c %0a%3c ^ The " royal" vine, according to Poinsinet, who would derive it from %0a%3c the Sclavonic " ban." %0a%3c %0a%3c 85 Previously mentioned, p. 228. %0a%3c %0a%3c 8« The residence of Horace, now Tivoli. %0a%3c %0a%3c Baccius says that the wine of this grape was thin like water, and that %0a%3c the vine was trained on lofty trees, a mode of cultivation still followed in %0a%3c the vicinity of Rome. Laurentum was situate within a short distance of %0a%3c it, near Ostia. %0a%3c %0a%3c S8 See B. iii. c. 9. %0a%3c %0a%3c So called from the smoky or intermediate colour of its grapes. Fee %0a%3c suggests that this may be the slow-ripening grape of France, called the %0a%3c " verjus," or " rognon de coq." %0a%3c %0a%3c ^ Possibly meaning the '• mouthful." %0a%3c %0a%3c '1 Perhaps so called from Prusa in Bithynia, a district which bore ex- %0a%3c cellent grapes. %0a%3c %0a%3c ^ Or the " turning " grape. A fabulous story no doubt, originating in %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 4.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c VAEIETIES OF THE TINE. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 231 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Gallic vine is a great favourite, while beyond ihe Alps that of %0a%3c Picenum^^ is preferred. Virgil has made mention »^ of the %0a%3c Thasian vine, the Mareotis, the lagea, and several other foreign %0a%3c varieties, which are not to be found in Italy. %0a%3c %0a%3c There are some vines, again, that are remarkable, not for %0a%3c their wine, but for their grapes, such, for instance, as the am- %0a%3c brosia, one of the " duracinus kind, a grape which requires %0a%3c no potting, but will keep perfectly well if left on the vine, so %0a%3c remarkable is the strength with which it is endowed for with- %0a%3c standing the effects of cold, heat, and stormy weather. The %0a%3c " orlhampelos," " too, is a vine that requires neither tree nor %0a%3c stay, as it is well able to sustain its own weight. This, how- %0a%3c ever, is not the case with the " dactylis,"^^ the stem of which %0a%3c is no thicker than the finger. The " columbina " is one of %0a%3c those with the finest clusters, and still more so is the purple %0a%3c " bimammia ;" it does not bear in clusters,' but only secondaiy %0a%3c bunches. There is the tripedanea,^ too, a name which it owes %0a%3c to the length of its clusters, and the scirpula,' with its shrivelled %0a%3c berry ; the Rhjetica,* too, so called in the Maritime Alps, though %0a%3c very difi'crent from the grape of that name which is so highly %0a%3c esteemed, and of which we have previously spoken ; for in %0a%3c this variety the clusters are small, the grapes lie closely packed, %0a%3c %0a%3c the name, probably. Fee suggests that it may have originated in the not %0a%3c uncommon practice of letting the bunches hang after they were ripe, and %0a%3c then twisting them, which was thought to increase the juice. %0a%3c In the modern Marches of Ancona. %0a%3c Georgics, ii. 91, et seq. %0a%3c %0a%3c Sunt Thasise vites, sunt et Mareotides albae : %0a%3c * * « * » %0a%3c %0a%3c Et passo Psithia utilior. tenuisque Lageos, %0a%3c Tentatura pedes olim, vincturaque linguam, %0a%3c %0a%3c Purpurcaj, Prcciaeque %0a%3c %0a%3c 5* A muscatel, Fee thinks. %0a%3c %0a%3c '■^ Or "hard-berried."

EEMARKABLE FACTS CONNECTED WITH THE %0a%3c %0a%3c CDLTURE OF THE VINE. %0a%3c %0a%3c The elder Cato, who was rendered more particularly illus- %0a%3c trious by his triumph-^ and the censorship, and even more so %0a%3c by his literary fame, and the precepts which he has given to %0a%3c the lloman people upon every subject of utility, and the %0a%3c proper methods of cultivation in particular ; a man who, by %0a%3c the universal confession, was the first husbandman of his age %0a%3c and without a rival — has mentioned a few varieties only of %0a%3c the vine, the very names of some of which are by this utterly %0a%3c forgotten.-^ His statement on this subject deserves our %0a%3c separate consideration, and requires to be quoted at length, in %0a%3c order that we may make ourselves acquainted with the differ- %0a%3c ent varieties of this tree that were held in the highest esteem %0a%3c in the year of the City of Rome 600, about the time of the %0a%3c capture of Carthage and Corinth, the period of his death : it %0a%3c will show too, what great advances civilization has made in %0a%3c the last two hundred and thirty years. The following are the %0a%3c remarks which he has made on the subject of the vine and the %0a%3c grape. %0a%3c %0a%3c ^' As the leaves of the vine arc universally divided, it has been considered %0a%3c by many of the commentators that this is not in reality a vine, but the %0a%3c Arbutus uva ursi of Linnaeus. The fruit, however, of that ericaceous %0a%3c plant is remarkably acrid, and i^t sweet, as Pliny states. Fee rejects this %0a%3c solution. %0a%3c %0a%3c Aubenas, in the Vivarais, according to Hardouin ; Alps, according to %0a%3c Brotier. We must reject this assertion as fabulous. %0a%3c -■- In li.c. 194, for his successes in Spain. %0a%3c %0a%3c 23 Mode of culture, locality, climate, and other extraneous circumstances, %0a%3c work, no doubt, an entire change in the nature of the vine. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 234 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c TLTNT's NATrilAL HISTOKT. [Book XIV. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c " Where the site is considered to be most fovourablo to the %0a%3c growth of the vine, and exposed to the warmth of the sun, %0a%3c you will do well to plant the smalP^ Aminean, as well as the %0a%3c two eugenia,-* and the smaller helvia."* On the other hand, %0a%3c where the soil is of a denser nature or more exposed to fogs, %0a%3c the greater Aminean should be planted, or else the Murgcn- %0a%3c tine," or the Apician of Lucania. The other varieties of the %0a%3c grape are, for the most part, adaj)ted to any kind of soil ; they %0a%3c are best preserved in a lora.** The best for keeping by hang- %0a%3c ing, are the duracinus kind, the greater Aminean, and the %0a%3c Scantian;^^ these, too, will make excellent raisins for keeping %0a%3c if dried at the blacksmith's forge." There are no precepts in %0a%3c the Latin language on this subject more ancient than these, so %0a%3c near are we to the very commencement of all our practical %0a%3c knowledge ! The Aminean grape, of which mention has been %0a%3c made above, is by Varro called the " Scantian." %0a%3c %0a%3c In our own times we have but few instances of any consum- %0a%3c mate skill that has been manifested in reference to this subject : %0a%3c the less excuse then should we have for omitting any particular %0a%3c which may tend to throw a light upon the profits that may %0a%3c be derived from the culture of the vine, a point which on all %0a%3c occasions is regarded as one of primary importance. Acilius %0a%3c Sthenelus, a man of plebeian rank, and the son of a freedman, %0a%3c acquired very considerable repute from the cultivation of a vine- %0a%3c yard in the territory of Is'omentum, not more than sixty jugera %0a%3c in extent, and which he finally sold for four hundred thousand %0a%3c sesterces. Vetulenus iEgialus too, a freedman as well, ac- %0a%3c quired very considerable note in the district of Liternum,^** in %0a%3c Campania, and, indeed, received a more extensive share of %0a%3c the public favour, from the fact that he cultivated the spot %0a%3c %0a%3c ^ Probably the first of the five that he has mentioned in c. 4. %0a%3c %0a%3c 25 He has only mentioned one sort in c. 4. %0a%3c %0a%3c 2« See c. 4. See c. 4, %0a%3c %0a%3c 28 We have no corresponding word for this beverage in the English %0a%3c language — a thin, poor liquor, made by pouring water on the husks and %0a%3c stalks after being fully pressed, allowing them to soak, pressing them again, %0a%3c and then fermenting the liquor. It was also called "vinum operarium," %0a%3c or " labourer's wine." As stated in the present instance, grapes were %0a%3c sometimes stored in it for keeping. %0a%3c %0a%3c 2' A variety of the Aminean, as stated below. %0a%3c %0a%3c 30 See B. iii. c. 9. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Cliap. 5.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c CULTUBE OF THE YUTE. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 235 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c which had been the place of exile of Scipio Africanus." The %0a%3c greatest celebrity of all, however, was that which, by the %0a%3c agency of the same Sthenelus, was accorded to Ilhemmius %0a%3c PaljBmon, who was also equally famous as a learned gram- %0a%3c marian. This person bought, some twenty years ago, an estate %0a%3c at the price of six hundred thousand sesterces in the same %0a%3c district of Nomentum, about ten miles distant from the City of %0a%3c Rome. The low price of property ^- in the suburbs, on every %0a%3c side of the City, is well known ; but in that quarter in particu- %0a%3c lar, it had declined to a most remarkable extent; for the %0a%3c estate which, he purchased had become deteriorated by long- %0a%3c continued neglect, in addition to which it was situate in the %0a%3c very worst part of a by no means favourite locality. Such %0a%3c Avas the nature of the property of which he thus undertook the %0a%3c cultivation, not, indeed, with any commendable views or inten- %0a%3c tions at first, but merely in that spirit of vanity for which he %0a%3c was notorious in so remarkable a degree. The vineyards were %0a%3c all duly dressed afresh, and hoed, under the superintendence of %0a%3c Sthenelus ; the result of which was that Palaemon, while thus %0a%3c plajdng the husbandman, brought this estate to such an almost %0a%3c incredible pitch of perfection, that at the end of eight years %0a%3c the vintage, as it hung on the trees, was knocked down to a %0a%3c purchaser for the sum of four hundred thousand sesterces; %0a%3c while all the world was running to behold the heaps upon heaps %0a%3c of grapes to be seen in these vineyards. The neighbours, by %0a%3c way of finding some excuse for their own indolence, gave all %0a%3c the credit of this remarkable success to Palaimon's profound %0a%3c erudition ; and at last Annseus Seneca,^'' who both held the %0a%3c highest rank in the learned world, and an amount of power and %0a%3c influence which at last proved too much for him — this same %0a%3c Seneca, who was far from being an admii-er of frivolity, was %0a%3c seized with such vast admiration of this estate, as not to feel %0a%3c ashamed at conceding this victory to a man who was other- %0a%3c wise the object of his hatred, and who would be sure to make %0a%3c the very most of it, by giving him four times the original cost %0a%3c 31 The elder Africanus.

I dismiss, however, all the fa- %0a%3c bulous stories and various traditions which we find relative to %0a%3c its origin, except, indeed, the one which states that Aristaeus,^^ a %0a%3c native of the same country, was the first person that mixed %0a%3c honey ^' with wine, natural productions, both of them, of the %0a%3c highest degree of excellence. Homer^^ has stated that the %0a%3c Mai'onean wine was mixed with water in the proportion of %0a%3c twenty measures of water to one of wine. The wine that is %0a%3c still produced in the same district retains all its former %0a%3c strength, and a degree of vigour that is quite insuperable. %0a%3c Mucianus, who thrice held the consulship, and one of our %0a%3c most recent authors, when in that part of the world was %0a%3c Avitness himself to the fact, that with one sextarius of this %0a%3c wine it was the custom to mix no less than eighty sextarii of %0a%3c %0a%3c ^5 Said to have been so called from Maron, a king of Thrace, who dwelt %0a%3c in the vicinity of the Thracian Isniarus.

In the %0a%3c year of the consulship of L. Opimius, when C, Gracchus," the %0a%3c tribune of the people, engaging in sedition, was slain, the %0a%3c growth of every Avine was of the very highest quality. In %0a%3c that year, the weather was remarkable for its sereneness, and %0a%3c the ripening of the grape, the " coctura,''"* as they call it, %0a%3c was fully effected by the heat of the sun. This was in the %0a%3c year of the City 633. There are wines still preserved of this %0a%3c year's growth, nearly two hundred years ago ; they have %0a%3c assumed the consistency of honey, with a rough taste ; for %0a%3c such, in fact, is the nature of wines, that, when extremely %0a%3c old, it is impossible to drink them in a pure state ; and they %0a%3c require to be mixed with water, as long keeping renders them %0a%3c intolerably bitter.^* A very small quantity of the Opimian %0a%3c wine, mixed with them, will suffice for the seasoning of other %0a%3c wines. Let us suppose, according to the estimated value of %0a%3c these wines in those days, that the original price of them was %0a%3c one hundred sesterces per amphora : if we add to this six per %0a%3c cent, per annum, a legal and moderate interest, we shall %0a%3c then be able to ascertain what was the exact price of the %0a%3c twelfth part of an amphora at the beginning of the reign of %0a%3c Caius Caisar, the son of Germanicus, one hundred and sixty %0a%3c years after that consulship. In relation to this fact, we have %0a%3c a remarkable instance,'"' when we call to mind the life of Pom- %0a%3c %0a%3c «» By " black " wines he means those that had the same colour as our %0a%3c port.

Dios- %0a%3c corides says that it was a " protropum," first-class wine, made of the juice %0a%3c that voluntarily flowed from the grapes, in consequence of their own pres- %0a%3c sure.

The people of %0a%3c Vienne, it is said, are the only ones who have set a higher price %0a%3c than this upon their " picata," wines, the various kinds of %0a%3c which we have already mentioned and this, it is thought, %0a%3c they only do, vying with each other, and influenced by a sort %0a%3c of national self-esteem.

It %0a%3c will not be foreign to my purpose on the present occasion to %0a%3c state the advice which Androcydes, a man famous for his %0a%3c wisdom, wrote to Alexander the Great, with the view of put- %0a%3c ting a check on his intemperance : " When you are about to %0a%3c drink wine, 0 king !" said he, "remember that you are about %0a%3c to drink the blood of the earth : hemlock is a poison to man, %0a%3c wine a poison*- to hemlock."

(6.) FIFTY KINDS OF GEXEEOUS WINES. %0a%3c %0a%3c Who can entertain a doubt that some kinds of wine are %0a%3c more agreeable to the palate than others, or that even out %0a%3c of the very same vat^' there are occasionally produced wines %0a%3c that are by no means of equal goodness, the one being much %0a%3c superior to the other, whether it is that it is owing to the %0a%3c cask,*^ or to some other fortuitous circumstance ? Let each %0a%3c person, therefore, constitute himself his own judge as to which %0a%3c kind it is that occupies the pre-eminence. Livia°^ Augusta, %0a%3c who lived to her eighty-second year,^' attributed her longevity %0a%3c to the wine of Pucinum,^® as she never drank any other. This %0a%3c wine is grown near a bay of the Adriatic, not far from Mount %0a%3c Timavus, upon a piece of elevated rocky ground, where the %0a%3c sea-breeze ripens a few grapes, the produce of which supplies %0a%3c a few amphorae : there is not a wine that is deemed superior %0a%3c to this for medicinal purposes. I am strongly of opinion that %0a%3c this is the same wine, the produce of the Adriatic Gulf, upon %0a%3c which the Greeks have bestowed such wonderful encomiums, %0a%3c under the name of Praetetianum. %0a%3c %0a%3c The late Emperor Augustus preferred the Setinum to all %0a%3c others, and nearly all the emperors that have succeeded him %0a%3c have followed his example, having learnt from actual expe- %0a%3c rience that there is no danger of indigestion and flatulence %0a%3c resulting from the use of this liquor : this wine is grown in %0a%3c the country** that lies just above Eorum Appii.""

The Falernian"^ vineyards begin at the bridge of %0a%3c Campania, on the left-hand as you journey towards the Urbana %0a%3c Colonia of Sylla, which was lately a township of the city of %0a%3c Capua. As to the Faustian vineyards, they extend about four %0a%3c miles from a village near Cajdicia;," the same village being six %0a%3c miles from Sinuessa. There is now no wine known that ranks %0a%3c higher than the Falernian ; it is the only one, too, among all %0a%3c the wines that takes fire on the application of flame. There %0a%3c are three varieties of it — the rough, the sweet, and the thin. %0a%3c Some persons make the following distinctions : the Caucinum, %0a%3c they say, grows on the summit of this range of hills, the Faus- %0a%3c tianum on the middle slopes, and the Falernum at the foot : %0a%3c the fact, too, should not be omitted, that none of the grapes %0a%3c that produce these more famous wines have by any means an %0a%3c agreeable flavour. %0a%3c %0a%3c To the third rank belonged the various wines of Alba, in the %0a%3c vicinity of the City, remarkable for their sweetness, and some- %0a%3c %0a%3c ^1 See B. iii. c. 9. Between Fundi and Setia ; a locality now of no %0a%3c repute for its wines. In B. xxiii. c. 19, Pliny says, that the Caecuban vine %0a%3c was extinct : but in B. xvii. c. 3, he says that in the Pomptine Marshes it %0a%3c was to be found. %0a%3c %0a%3c ^'^ This was the case, it has been remarked, with Madeira some years ao-o. %0a%3c %0a%3c ^3 This is the most celebrated of all the ancient wines, as being more %0a%3c especially the theme of the poets. %0a%3c %0a%3c See B. xi. c. 97.

The Calenian'' wines, too, from the same %0a%3c neigliboiirhood, used to be preferred to those last mentioned, %0a%3c as also the Fundanian," the produce of vines grown on stay.-*, %0a%3c or else attached to shrubs. The wines, too, of Veliternum"^ %0a%3c and Priverna," which were grown in the vicinity of the City, %0a%3c used to be highly esteemed.

But the most celebrated of all %0a%3c of them, owing to the fact that Messala''* used to drink it, and %0a%3c was indebted to it for his excellent health, was the wine %0a%3c of Lagara,'^ which was grown not far from Grumentum.^ In %0a%3c Campania, more recently, new growths under new names have %0a%3c gained considerable credit, either owing to careful cultivation, %0a%3c or else to some other fortuitous circumstances : thus, for in- %0a%3c stance, we find four miles from Neapolis the Trebellian,^ near %0a%3c %0a%3c ^- Now P?ziers, in the south of France. The wines of this part are %0a%3c considered excellent at the present day. Tliat of Frontignan grows in its %0a%3c vicinity.

After the Avines %0a%3c mentioned by Homer, and of which we have already spoken,'* %0a%3c those held in the highest esteem were the wines of Thasos %0a%3c and Chios, and of the latter more particularly the sort known %0a%3c as " Arvisium.'"^ Ey the side of these has been placed the %0a%3c wine of Losbos," upon the authority of Erasistratus, a famous %0a%3c physician, who flourished about the year of the Citj' of Rome %0a%3c 450. At the present day, the most esteemed of all is the wine %0a%3c of Clazomenoe,'* since they have learned to season it more %0a%3c sparingly with sea-water. The wine of Lesbos has naturally %0a%3c a taste of sea- water. That from Mount Tmolus'* is not so %0a%3c much esteemed by itself^" for its qualities as a wine, as for its %0a%3c peculiar sweetness. It is on account of this that it is mixed %0a%3c with other wines, for the purpose of modifying their harsh %0a%3c flavour, by imparting to them a portion of its own sweetness ; %0a%3c while at the same time it gives them age, for immediately %0a%3c after the mixture they appear to be much older than they %0a%3c really are.

(8.) SEVEN KINDS OF SALTED WINES. %0a%3c %0a%3c Thus far we have treated of wines, the goodness of which is %0a%3c due to the country of their growth. In Greece the wine that %0a%3c is known by the name of " bion," and which is administered %0a%3c for its curative qualities in several maladies (as Ave shall have %0a%3c occasion to remark when we come to speak on the subject of %0a%3c Medicine^'), has been justly held in the very highest esteem. %0a%3c This wine is made in the following manner : the grapes are %0a%3c plucked before they are quite ripe, and then dried in a hot %0a%3c sun : for three days they are turned three times a day, and on %0a%3c the fourth day they are pressed, after which the juice is put %0a%3c in casks, and left to acquire age in the heat of the sun.'*'' %0a%3c %0a%3c The people of Cos mix sea- water in large quantities with %0a%3c their wines, an invention which they first learned from a slave, %0a%3c wlio adopted this method of supplying the deficiency that had %0a%3c been caused by his thievish propensities. "When this is mixed %0a%3c with white must, the mixture receives the name of "leu- %0a%3c %0a%3c *' From its Greek name, it would seem to mean " of first quality." %0a%3c *■ So called from a place in Euboea, the modern Negropont.

The Khodian'^ wine is %0a%3c similar to that of Cos, and the Phorinean is of a still Salter %0a%3c flavour.

All these mixtures have been de- %0a%3c vised for the adulteration of honey." As to those varieties %0a%3c which we have previously mentioned, their merits depend %0a%3c upon the grape, and the soil in which it is grown. Next %0a%3c after the raisin- wine of Crete,'^ those of Cilicia and Africa are %0a%3c held in the highest esteem, both in Italy as well as the ad- %0a%3c joining provinces. It is well known that it is made of a grape %0a%3c to which the Greeks have given the name of " stica," and which %0a%3c by us is called " apiana it is also made of the scirpula.'" %0a%3c The grapes arc left on the vine to dry in the sun, or else are %0a%3c boiled in the dolium." Some persons make this wine of the %0a%3c Bweet and early white''^ grape : they leave the grapes to %0a%3c dry in the sun, until they have lost pretty nearly half their %0a%3c weight, after which thej"- crush them and subject them to a %0a%3c gentle pressure. They then draw off the juice, and add to %0a%3c the pulp that is left an equal quantity of well-water, the pro- %0a%3c duct of which is raisin-wine of second quality," The more %0a%3c careful makers not only do this, but take care also after drying %0a%3c the grapes to remove the stalks, and then steep the raisins in %0a%3c wine of good quality until they swell, after which they press %0a%3c them. This kind of raisin-wine is preferred to all others : %0a%3c with the addition of water, they follow the same plan in %0a%3c making the wine of second quality. %0a%3c %0a%3c The liquor to which the Greeks give the name of " aigleu- %0a%3c cos,"^^ is of middle' qualit}^ between the sirops and what is %0a%3c properly called Aviue ; with us it is called " semper mustum.'"* %0a%3c It is only made by using great precaution, and taking care %0a%3c that the must does not ferment;'* such being the state of the %0a%3c %0a%3c «« This was evidently a kind of grape sirop, or grape jelly.

It is made by drying grapes in thn %0a%3c Bun, and then placing them for seven days in a closed place %0a%3c upon hurdles, some seven feet from the ground, care being %0a%3c taken to protect them at night from the dews : on the eighth %0a%3c day they are trodden out : this method, it is said, produces a %0a%3c liquor of exquisite bouquet and flavour. The liquor known as %0a%3c melitites* is also one of the sweet wines : it differs from %0a%3c mulsum, in being made of must ; to five congii of rough-fla- %0a%3c voured must they put one congius of honey, and one cyathus %0a%3c of salt, and they are then brought to a gentle boil : this mix- %0a%3c ture is of a rough flavour. Among these varieties, I ought to %0a%3c place what is known as " protropum such being the name %0a%3c given by some to the must that runs spontaneouslj^ from the %0a%3c grapes before they are trodden out. Directly it flows it is %0a%3c put into flaggons, and allowed to ferment ; after which it is %0a%3c left to ripen for forty days in a summer sun, about the rising %0a%3c of the Dog-star. %0a%3c %0a%3c " "Sweet" drink.

TUREE VARIETIES OF SECOND-KATE WINE. %0a%3c %0a%3c Those cannot properly be termed wines, which by the %0a%3c Greeks are known under the name of " deuteria,"** and to %0a%3c which, in common with Cato, we in Italy give the name of %0a%3c " lora,' *'^ being made from the husks of grapes steeped in %0a%3c water. Still, however, this beverage is reckoned as making %0a%3c cue of the " labourers'"*' wines. There are three varieties of %0a%3c it: the first is made in the following manner: — After the %0a%3c must is drawn off, one-tenth of its amount in water is added %0a%3c to the husks, which are then left to soak a day and a night, %0a%3c and then are again subjected to pressure. A second kind, %0a%3c that which the Greeks are in the habit of making, is prepared %0a%3c by adding one-third in water of the quantity of must that has %0a%3c been drawn off, and after submitting tlie pulp to pressure, the %0a%3c result is reduced by boiling to one-third of its original quan- %0a%3c tity. A. third kind, again, is pressed out from the wine-lees ; %0a%3c Cato gives it the name of " Ikcatum."*^ None of these be- %0a%3c verages, however, Avill keep for more than a single year. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 13.

The Posthumian Law, promulgated by King %0a%3c Numa, has an injunction to the following effect : — " Sprinkle %0a%3c not the funeral pyre with wine ;" a law to which he gave his %0a%3c sanction, no doubt, in consequence of the remarkable scarcity %0a%3c of that commodity in those days. By the same law, he also %0a%3c pronounced it illegal to make a libation to the gods of wine that %0a%3c was the produce of an unpruned vine, his object being to compel %0a%3c the husbandmen to prune their vines ; a duty which they %0a%3c showed themselves reluctant to perform, in consequence of the %0a%3c danger which attended climbing the trees."' M. Varro in- %0a%3c forms us, that Mezentius, the king of Etruria, succoured the %0a%3c Rutuli against the Latini, upon condition that he should re- %0a%3c ceive all the wine that was then in the territorj' of Latium. %0a%3c %0a%3c (13.) At Rome it was not lawful for women to drink wine. %0a%3c Among the various anecdotes conuected with this subject, we %0a%3c find that the wife of Egnatius Mecenius was slain by her hus- %0a%3c band with a stick, because she had drunk some wine from the vat, %0a%3c and that he was absolved from the murder by Romulus. Fabius %0a%3c Pictor, in his Rook of Annals, has stated that a certain lady, %0a%3c for having opened a purse in which the keys of the wine-cellar %0a%3c were kept, was starved to death by her family : and Cato tells %0a%3c us, that it was the usage for the male relatives to give the %0a%3c females a kiss, in order to ascertain whether they smelt of %0a%3c " temetum ;" for it was by that name that wine was then %0a%3c known, whence our word " temulentia," signifying drunken- %0a%3c ness. Cn. Domitius, the judge, once gave it as his opinion, %0a%3c that a certain woman appeared to him to have drunk more %0a%3c wine than was requisite for her health, and without the know- %0a%3c ledge of her husband, for which reason he condemned her to %0a%3c lose her dower. For a very long time there was the greatest %0a%3c %0a%3c " Circa pericula arbusti." This is probably the meaning of this very %0a%3c elliptical passage.

TUE OPIMIAN AVINE. %0a%3c %0a%3c The fact of the existence of the Opimian wine gives un- %0a%3c doubted proof that there were wine-lot'ts,^ and that wine was %0a%3c racked off in the year of Home 633, Italy being already alive %0a%3c to the blessings she enjoyed. Still, however, the several %0a%3c varieties that are now so celebrated were not so in those days ; %0a%3c and hence it is that all the wines that were grown at that %0a%3c jjeriod have only the one general name of "Opimian" wines, %0a%3c irom the then consul Opimius. So, too, for a long time after- %0a%3c wards, and, indeed, so late as the times of our grandfathers, the %0a%3c wines from beyond sea were held in the highest esteem, even %0a%3c though Falernian was already known, a fact which we learn %0a%3c from the line of the Comic writer,* " I shall draw five cups of %0a%3c Thasian and two of ralornian." %0a%3c %0a%3c P. Licinius Crassus, and L. Julius Caesar, who were Cen- %0a%3c sors in the year from the Building of the City 665, issued an %0a%3c edict forbidding the sale of either Greek or Amincan wine at %0a%3c a higher price than eight asses the quadrantaP — for such, in %0a%3c fact, are the exact words of the edict. Indeed, the Greek %0a%3c wines were so highl)- valued, that not more than a single cup %0a%3c was served to a guest daring the repast. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 17. — AT WnAT PERIOD FOUR KINDS OF WINS W1:RE FIRST %0a%3c SERVED AT TABLE. %0a%3c %0a%3c M.

The " apothecae " were rooms at the top of the house, in %0a%3c which the wines were placL-d for the purpose of seasoning. Sometimes a %0a%3c current of smoke was directed through them. They were quite distinct %0a%3c from the " cella vinaria," or "wine-cellar." The Opimian wine is men- %0a%3c tioned in c. 4. %0a%3c %0a%3c * This writer is unknown. * Or amphora. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 18.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c USES OF THE W ILD TINE. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 255 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c wine was handed round more than once during the repast: %0a%3c whereas he himself, when he returned from Asia, distributed %0a%3c as a largess among the people more than a hundred thousand %0a%3c congiaria* of the same Avine. C. Sentius, whom we have seen %0a%3c Praetor, used to say that Chian wine never entered his house %0a%3c until his physician prescribed it to him for the cardiac' dis- %0a%3c ease. On the other hand, Hortcnsius left ten thousand casks %0a%3c of it to his heir." Such is the statement made by Varro. %0a%3c %0a%3c (15.) And besides, is it not a well-known fact that Csesar, %0a%3c when Dictator, at the banquet given on the occasion of his %0a%3c triumph, allotted to each table an amphora of Falernian and a %0a%3c cadus of Chian? On the occasion, too, of his triumph for his %0a%3c victories in Spain, he put before the guests both Cbian as well %0a%3c as Falernian ; and again, at the banquet given on his third %0a%3c consulship,* he gave Falernian, Chian, Lesbian, and Mamer- %0a%3c tine ; indeed, it is generally agreed that this was the first %0a%3c occasion on which four different kinds of wine were served at %0a%3c table. It was after this, then, that all the other sorts camo %0a%3c into such very high repute, somewhere about the year of the %0a%3c City 700. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 18. (16.) THK USES OF THE WILD VINE.

We have already %0a%3c stated in a former Book how omi)liacium,* which is used for %0a%3c unguents, is made. The liqupr known as " ocnanthinum " is %0a%3c made from the wild vine,'" two pounds of the flowers of which %0a%3c are steeped in a cadus of must, and are then changed at the %0a%3c end of thirty days.

The %0a%3c wild vine is not a distinct speciis from the cultivated \'ine : it is only a %0a%3c variety of it known in botany as the Vitis silvestris labrusca of Tournefort. %0a%3c Fee thinks that as the must oould only be used in autumn, when the wild %0a%3c vine was not flowering, the flowers of it must have been dried. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 256 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c flint's NATTJHAL niSTORT. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XIV. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c busks of the grapes are employed in dressing leather.

SIXTT-SIX VARIETIES OF AETIFICIAL WINE. %0a%3c %0a%3c The first of the artificial wines has wine for its basis ; it is %0a%3c called " adynrimon,"" and is made in the following manner. %0a%3c Twenty sextarii of white must are boiled down with half that %0a%3c quantity of water, until the amount of the water is lost by %0a%3c evaporation. Some persons mix with the must ten sextarii of %0a%3c sea-water and an equal quantity of rain-water, and leave the %0a%3c whole to evaporate in the sun for forty days. This beverage %0a%3c is given to invalids to whom it is apprehended that wine may %0a%3c prove injurious. %0a%3c %0a%3c The next kind of artificial wine is that made of the ripe %0a%3c grain of millet;'* a pound and a quarter of it with the straw %0a%3c is steeped in two congii of must, and the mixture is poured off %0a%3c at the end of six months. We have already stated" how %0a%3c various kinds of wine are made from the tree, the shrub, and %0a%3c the herb, respectively known as the lotus. %0a%3c %0a%3c From fruit, too, the following wines are made, to the list of %0a%3c which we shall only add some necessary explanations : — First %0a%3c of all, we find the fruit of the palm'* employed for this pur- %0a%3c %0a%3c 13 " Solstitiales."

A modius of tho %0a%3c kind of ripe date called "chydaeaj"^' is added to three congii %0a%3c of water, and after being steeped for some time, they arc %0a%3c subjected to pressure. Sycites^" is a preparation similarly %0a%3c made from figs : some persons call it " palmiprimum,""' others, %0a%3c again, " catorchites : " if sweetness is not the maker's object, %0a%3c instead of water there is added the same quantity of iiusk %0a%3c juice^- of grapes. Of the Cyprian fig^^ a very excellent vinegar, %0a%3c too, is made, and of that of Alexandria a still superior. %0a%3c %0a%3c A wine is made, too, of tlie pods of the Syrian carob,^^ of %0a%3c pears, and of all kinds of apples. That known as " rhoites"^ %0a%3c is made from pomegranates, and other varieties are prepared %0a%3c from cornels, medlars, sorb apples, dried mulberries, and pine- %0a%3c nuts these last are left to steep in must, and arc then pressed ; %0a%3c the others produce a sweet liquor of tliemselvcs. We shall %0a%3c have occasion before long to show how Cato^* has pointed out %0a%3c the method of making mj-rtites the Greeks, however, adopt %0a%3c a different method in making it. They first boil tender sprigs %0a%3c of myrtle witb the leaves on in white must, and after pound- %0a%3c ing them, boil down one pound of the mixture in three congii %0a%3c of must, until it is reduced to a couple of congii. The be- %0a%3c verage that is prepared in this manner with the berries of %0a%3c wild myrtle is known as " myrtidanum ;" it will stain the %0a%3c hands. %0a%3c %0a%3c Among the garden plants we find wines made of the follow- %0a%3c ing kinds : the radish, asparagus, cunila, origanum, parslcy- %0a%3c %0a%3c '9 lie says "caryotoc," and not chydajse, in B. xiii. c. 4.

(18.) TWELVE KINDS OF WINE WITH MIRACULOUS %0a%3c %0a%3c PEOPEETIES. %0a%3c %0a%3c There are some miraculous properties, too, in certain wines. %0a%3c It is said that in Arcadia there is a Avine grown Avhicli is %0a%3c productive of fruitfulness"' in women, and of madness in men ; %0a%3c while in Achaia, and more especially in the vicinity of Cary- %0a%3c nia, there is a wine which causes abortion ; an eflect which is %0a%3c equally produced if a woman in a state of pregnancy happens %0a%3c only to eat a grape of the vine from which it is grown, although %0a%3c in taste it is in no way different from ordinary grapes : again, %0a%3c it is confidently asserted that those who drink the wine of %0a%3c Troezen never bear children. Thasos, it is said, produces two %0a%3c varieties of wine with quite opposite properties. By one kind %0a%3c sleep is produced,^* by the other it is prevented. There is %0a%3c also in the same island a vine known as the " theriaca,"*" the %0a%3c wine and grapes of which are a cure for the bites of serpents. %0a%3c The libanian vine^ also produces a wine with the smell of %0a%3c frankincense, with which they make libations to the gods, while, %0a%3c on the other hand, the produce of that known as " aspen dios,^" %0a%3c is banished from all the altars : it is said, too, that this last %0a%3c vine is never touched by any bird. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Egyptians call by the name of "Thasian,"^ a cortnin %0a%3c grape of that country, remarkable for its sweetness and its %0a%3c %0a%3c ^8 Our medicinal wines will mostly keep longer than this, owing probably %0a%3c to the diiFerence in tbe mode of making the real wines that form their %0a%3c basis. %0a%3c %0a%3c There is Httle doubt that this is fabulous : wine taken in excess, wo %0a%3c know, is productive of loss of the senses, frenzy in the shape of deUrium %0a%3c tremens. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is not unlikely ; for, as Fee remarks, the red wines, containing %0a%3c a large proportion of alcohol, act upon the brain and promote sleep, while %0a%3c tlie white wines, charged with carbonic gas, are productive of wakefulness. %0a%3c %0a%3c Or healing vine.

On the other hand, there is in Lycia a %0a%3c certain grape which proves astringent to the stomach when %0a%3c relaxed. Egypt has a wine, too, known as "echolas,"* which %0a%3c is productive of abortion. There are some wines, which at %0a%3c the rising of the Dog-star change their nature in the wine- %0a%3c lofts" where they are kept, and afterwards recover* their %0a%3c original quality. The same is the case, too, with wines when %0a%3c carried across the seas : those that are able to withstand the %0a%3c motion of the waves, appear afterwards to be twice as old ' as %0a%3c they really are. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 23. (19.) WHAT WINES IT IS NOT LAWFUL TO USE IN TUE %0a%3c %0a%3c SACKED RITES. %0a%3c %0a%3c As religion is the great basis of the ordinary usages of life, %0a%3c I shall here remark that it is considered im})roper to oft'er %0a%3c libations to the gods w'ith any wines which are the produce of %0a%3c an unpruned vine, or of one that has been struck by lightning, %0a%3c or near to which a dead man has been hung, or of grapes that %0a%3c have been trodden out by sore feet, or made of must from %0a%3c husks that have been cut,** or from grapes that have been %0a%3c polkited by the fall of any unclean thing upon them. The %0a%3c Greek wines are excluded also IVoni the sacred ministrations, %0a%3c because they contain a portion of w'atcr. %0a%3c %0a%3c The vine itself is sometimes eaten; the tops of the shoots" %0a%3c are taken off and boiled, and are then pickled in vinegar %0a%3c and brine. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 24. — now MUST is usually pkepared. %0a%3c It will be as well now to make some mention of the methods %0a%3c %0a%3c * From iKj3aX\o>, " to eject." * Apothccis. %0a%3c %0a%3c " He alludes to the working of wines in periods of extreme heat ; also %0a%3c in the spring. %0a%3c %0a%3c ' Of our modern wines, Madeira and Bourdeaux improve by being carried %0a%3c across sea. Burgundy, if any thiug, deteriorates, by the diminution of its %0a%3c bouquet. %0a%3c %0a%3c 8 After the grapes had been trodden and pressed, the husks were taken %0a%3c out and their edges cut, and then again subjected to pressure : the result %0a%3c was k^own as " tortivum," or "circumcisivum," a wine of very inferior %0a%3c quality. %0a%3c %0a%3c » He alludes to the young; shoots, which have an agreeable acidity, %0a%3c owing to acetic and tartaric acids. %0a%3c %0a%3c Acetic acid ; the result, no doubt, of the faulty mode of manufacture %0a%3c universally prevdeut ; their wines contained evidently but little alcohol. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 264 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c PLINi's NATURAL HISTORY. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XIV. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c used ill preparing wines ; indeed, several of the Greeks have %0a%3c written separate treatises on this subject, and have made a %0a%3c complete art of it, such, for instance, as Euphronitis, Aristo- %0a%3c machus, Commiades, and Hicesius. The people of Africa are %0a%3c in the habit of neutralizing such aciditj' as may be found %0a%3c with gypsum, and in some parts with lime. The people of %0a%3c Greece, on the other hand, impart briskness to their wines %0a%3c when too flat, with potters' earth, pounded marble, salt, or %0a%3c sea- water ; while in Italy, again, brown pitch is used for tliat %0a%3c purpose in some parts, and it is the universal practice both %0a%3c there as well as in the adjoining provinces to season their new %0a%3c wines with resin : sometimes, too, they season them with old %0a%3c wine-lees or vinegar.^- They make various medicaments, also, %0a%3c for this purpose with the must itself. They boil it down till %0a%3c it becomes quite sweet, and has lost a considerable portion of %0a%3c its strength ; though thus prepared, they say it will never last %0a%3c beyond a single year. In some places they boil down the %0a%3c must till it becomes sapa," and then mix it with their wines %0a%3c for the purpose of modifying their harshness. Both for %0a%3c these kinds of wines, as, indeed, all others, they always employ %0a%3c vessels which have themselves received an inner coat of pitch ; %0a%3c the method of preparing them will be set forth in a succeeding %0a%3c Book.i* %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 25. (20.) — PITCH and hesin. %0a%3c %0a%3c Of the trees from which pitch and resin distil, there are %0a%3c some which grow in the East, and others in Europe : the pro- %0a%3c vince of Asia,^^ which lies between the two, has also some of %0a%3c both kinds. In the East, the very best commodity of this %0a%3c kind, and of the finest quality, is that produced by the tere- %0a%3c binth,^^ and, next to it, that from the lentisk," which is also %0a%3c known as the mastich. The next in quality to these is the juice %0a%3c of the cypress,^^ being of a more aci'id flavour than any other. %0a%3c %0a%3c '1 See B. xxiii. c. 24, and B. xxxvi. c. 48. %0a%3c %0a%3c ^'^ A process very likely, as Fee remarks, to turn the wines speedily to %0a%3c vinegar. %0a%3c %0a%3c 13 Down to one-third.

The Arabian resin is of a %0a%3c pale colour, has an acrid smell, and its fumes are stifling to %0a%3c those employed in boiling it. That of Judaea is of a harder %0a%3c nature, and has a stronger smell than that from the terebinth'' %0a%3c even. The Syrian - resin has all the appearance of Attic %0a%3c honey, but that of Cyprus is superior to any other ; it is the %0a%3c colour of honey, and is of a soft, fleshy nature. The resin of %0a%3c Colophon^* is yellower than the other varieties, but when %0a%3c pounded it turns white; it has a stifling smell, for which %0a%3c reason the perfumers do not employ it. Tliat prepared in %0a%3c Asia from the produce of the pitch-tree is very white, and is %0a%3c known by the name of " spagas." %0a%3c %0a%3c All the resins are soluble in oil some persons are of opi- %0a%3c nion also that potters' chalk may be so dissolved I feel %0a%3c ashamed ^' to avow that the principal esteem in which the %0a%3c resins arc held among us is as depilatories for taking the hair %0a%3c off men's bodies. %0a%3c %0a%3c The method used for seasoning wines is to sprinkle pitch %0a%3c in the must during the first fermentation, -which never lasts %0a%3c beyond nine days at the most, so that a bouquet is imparted %0a%3c to the wine,'^ with, in some degree, its own peculiar piquancy %0a%3c of flavour. It is generally considered, that this is done most %0a%3c e.Tectually by the use of raw flower'-" of resin, which imparts %0a%3c a considerable degree of briskness to wine : W'hile, on the %0a%3c other hand, it is thought that crapula^" itself, if mixed, tends %0a%3c %0a%3c "> See B. xiii. c. 11, and B. xvi. c. 21.

In tliis fresh che- %0a%3c mical change, wliich he calls a second fermentation, the wine becomes %0a%3c vinegar ; and probably in the cases he mentions, for some peculiar reason, %0a%3c its speedy transition to " vappa " could not be arrested. %0a%3c %0a%3c 33 Mixed with water, it was the " posca," or common drink of the Roman %0a%3c soldiers ; and it was used extensively both by Greeks and Eomans in their %0a%3c cooking, and at meals. %0a%3c %0a%3c 3i In c. 24. %0a%3c %0a%3c 35 By the mixture of ashes, Fee says, the wines would lose their colour, %0a%3c and have a detestable alkaline flavour. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Cliiip. 2.3.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c PITCH AND EESIN. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 267 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c lo take sea-Tvatcr far out at sea, and to keep it in reserve/^ %0a%3c to be employed lor this purpose : at all events, it ought to be %0a%3c taken up in the night and during the summer solstice, -while %0a%3c the north-east wind is blowing ; but if taken at the time of %0a%3c the vintage, it should be boiled before being used. %0a%3c %0a%3c The pitch most highly esteemed in Italy for preparing %0a%3c vessels for storing wine, is that -which comes from Eruttium. %0a%3c It is made from the resin that distils from the pitch-tree ; that %0a%3c Avhich is used in Spain is held in but little est(;em, being the %0a%3c produce of the -wild pine ; it is bitter, dry, and of a disagree- %0a%3c able smell. While speaking of the -wild trees in a succeeding %0a%3c liook," we shall make mention of the different varieties of pitch, %0a%3c and the methods used in preparing it. The defects in resin, %0a%3c besides those which we have already mentioned, area certain %0a%3c degree of acridity, or a peculiar smoky flavour, while the great %0a%3c fault in pitch is the being over-burnt. The ordinary test %0a%3c of its goodness is a certain luminous appearance when broken %0a%3c to pieces ; it ought to stick, too, to the teeth, with a pleasant, %0a%3c tart flavour. %0a%3c %0a%3c In Asia, the pitch which is most esteemed is that of Mount %0a%3c Ida, in Greece of Pieria; but Virgil^^ gives the preference to %0a%3c the Narycian*" pitch.

(21.) — WINE- VESSELS WINE-CELLAllS. %0a%3c %0a%3c The various methods of keeping and storing wines in the %0a%3c cellar are very different. In the vicinity of the Alps, they put %0a%3c their wines in wooden vessels hooped around during their %0a%3c cold winters, they even keep lighted fires, to protect the wines %0a%3c from the effects of the cold. It is a singular thing to men- %0a%3c tion, but still it has been occasionally seen, that these vessels %0a%3c have burst asunder, and there has stood the wine in frozen %0a%3c masses ; a miracle almost, as it is not ordinarily the nature of %0a%3c wine to freeze, cold having only the effect of benumbing it. %0a%3c In more temperate climates, they place their wines in dolia,^' %0a%3c which they bury in the earth, either covering them entirelj' or %0a%3c in part, according to the temperature. Sometimes, again, they %0a%3c expose their wines in the open air, while at others they are %0a%3c placed beneath sheds for protection from the atmosphere. %0a%3c %0a%3c The second " squeezings.'' %0a%3c %0a%3c If the wine is turning to vinegar, suhacetate of lead will be formed. %0a%3c They are tartrates, and have no affinity at all with nitre. %0a%3c Casks, in fact, similar to those used in France at the present day.

All dunghills and roots of trees, and everj-thihg of %0a%3c a repulsive smell, ought to be kept at as great a distance as %0a%3c possible, wine being very apt to contract an odour. Fig-trees %0a%3c too, either wild or cultivated, ought not to be planted in the %0a%3c vicinity. Intervals should also be left between the vessels, %0a%3c in order to prevent infection, in case of any of them turning %0a%3c bad, wine being remarkably apt to become tainted. The %0a%3c shape, too, of the vessels is of considerable importance : those %0a%3c tliat are broad and bellying " are not so good.*'- "NYe find it re- %0a%3c commended too, to pitch them immediately after the rising of %0a%3c tlie Dog-star, and then to wash them either with sea or salt %0a%3c water, after which they should be sprinkled with the ashes of %0a%3c tree-shoots or else with potters' earth ; they ought then to be %0a%3c cleaned out, and perfumed with myrrh, a thing which ought %0a%3c to be frequently done to the wine-cellars as well. "Weak, %0a%3c thin wines should be kept" in dolia sunk in the ground, while %0a%3c those in which the stronger ones are kept should be more ex- %0a%3c posed to the air. Tlie vessels ought on no account to be entirely %0a%3c filled, room being left for seasoning, by mixing either raisin %0a%3c wine or else defrutum flavoured with saflTron ; old pitch and %0a%3c sapa are sometimes used for the same purpose. Tlie lids, too, %0a%3c uf the dolia ought to be seasoned in a similar manner, with %0a%3c the addition of mastich and Bruttian pitch. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is strongly recommended never to open the vessels, ex- %0a%3c cept in fine weather ; nor yet while a south wind is blowing, %0a%3c oV at a full moon. %0a%3c %0a%3c The flower" of wine when white is looked upon as a good %0a%3c sign ; but when it is red, it is bad, unless that should happen %0a%3c to be the colour of the wine. The vessels, too, should not be %0a%3c hot to the touch, nor should the covers throw out a sort of %0a%3c sweat. "When wine very soon flowers on the surface and %0a%3c emits an odour, it is a sign that it will not keep. %0a%3c %0a%3c As to defrutum and sapa, it is recommended to commence %0a%3c boiling them when there is no moon to be seen, or, m other %0a%3c %0a%3c »i "Ventruosa."

We, on the other %0a%3c hand, even go so far as to make our very beasts of burden %0a%3c drink*^ wine : so vast are our efforts, so vast our labours, and %0a%3c so boundless the cost which we thus lavish upon a liquid %0a%3c which deprives man of his reason and drives him to frenzy %0a%3c and to the commission of a thousand crimes !

Others there are, again, who can- %0a%3c not wait till tliey have got to the banqueting couch,^'^ no, not %0a%3c so much as till they have got their shirt on,"^'* but all naked %0a%3c and panting as they are, the instant they leave the bath they %0a%3c seize hold of large vessels filled with wine, to show off, as it %0a%3c were, their miglity powers, and so gulp down the whole of the %0a%3c contents onlj- to vomit them up again the very next moment. %0a%3c This they will repeat, too, a second and even a third time, %0a%3c just as though they had only been begotten for the purpose of %0a%3c wasting wine, and as if that liquor could not be thrown away %0a%3c without having first passed through the human body. It is %0a%3c to encourage habits such as these that we have introduced the %0a%3c athletic exercises"' of other countries, such as rolling in the %0a%3c mud, for instance, and throwing the arras back to show off a %0a%3c brawny neck and chest. Of all these exercises, thirst, it is %0a%3c said, is the chief and primary object. %0a%3c %0a%3c And then, too, what vessels are employed for holding wine I %0a%3c carved all over with the representations of adulterous intrigues, %0a%3c as if, in fact, drunkenness itself was not sufficiently capable of %0a%3c teaching us lessons of lustfulness. Thus we see wines quaffed %0a%3c out of impurities, and inebriety invited even by the hope of a %0a%3c reward, — invited, did I say ? — may the gods forgive me for %0a%3c saying so, purchased outright. We find one person induced %0a%3c to drink upon the. condition that he shall have as much to eat %0a%3c as he has previously drunk, while another has to quaff as %0a%3c many cups as he has thrown points on the dice. Then it is %0a%3c that the roving, insatiate eyes are setting a price upon the %0a%3c matrou's chastity; and yet, heavy as they are with wine, they %0a%3c do not fail to betray their designs to her husband. Then %0a%3c it is that all the secrets of the mind are revealed ; one man is %0a%3c henrd to disclose the provisions of his Avill, another lets fidl %0a%3c some expn'ssion of fatal import, and so fails to keep to himself %0a%3c words M-hich will be sure to come home to him with a cut %0a%3c %0a%3c 6- Tliis seems to be the meaning of " lectum ;" but the passage is ob- %0a%3c scure.

From wine, too, comes %0a%3c that pallid hue,** those drooping eyelids, those sore eyes, those %0a%3c tremulous hands, unable to hold with steadiness the over- %0a%3c flowing vessel, condign punishment in the shape of sleep agi- %0a%3c tated b)' Furies during the restless night, and, the supreme %0a%3c reward of inebriety, those dreams of monstrous lustfulness and %0a%3c of forbidden delights. Then on the next day there is the breath %0a%3c reeking of the wine-cask, and a nearly total obliviousness of %0a%3c everything, from the annihilation of the powers of the memory. %0a%3c And this, too, is what they call " seizing the moments of lilel''" %0a%3c whereas, in realitj^, while other men lose the day that lias gone %0a%3c before, the drinker has already lost the one that is to come. %0a%3c %0a%3c They fii-st began, in the reign of Tiberius Claudius, some %0a%3c forty years ago, to drink fasting, and to take whets of wine %0a%3c before meals; an outlandish*^ fashion, however, and only pa- %0a%3c tronized by physicians who wished to recommend themselves %0a%3c by the introduction of some novelty or other. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is in the exercise of their drinking powers that the Par- %0a%3c thians look for their share of fame, and it was in this that %0a%3c Alcibiades among the Greeks earned his great repute. Among %0a%3c ourselves, too, Novellius Torquatus of Mediolanum, a man %0a%3c who held all the honours of the state from the prefecture to the %0a%3c pro-consulate, could drink off three congii*^ at a single draught, %0a%3c a feat from which he obtained the surname of "Tricon- %0a%3c gius :" this he did before the eyes of the Emperor Tiberius, %0a%3c and to his extreme surprise and astonishment, a man who in %0a%3c his old age was very morose,™ and indeed very cruel in gene- %0a%3c ral ; though in his younger days he himself had been too %0a%3c much addicted to wine.

For, in fact, such is the infallible %0a%3c characteristic of drunkenness, the more a pcnson is in the %0a%3c habit of drinking, the more eager he is for drink ; and the %0a%3c remark of the Scythian ambassador is as true as it is well %0a%3c known — the more the Parthians drank, the thirstier they were %0a%3c for it. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 29. LIQUORS WITH THE STRENGTH OF WINE MADE FROM %0a%3c %0a%3c WATER AND CORN. %0a%3c %0a%3c The people of the Western world have also their intoxi- %0a%3c cating drinks, made from corn steeped in water.'* These %0a%3c beverages are prepared in different waj^s throughout Gaul %0a%3c and the pro\-inces of Spain ; under different names, too, %0a%3c though in their results they are the same. The Spanish %0a%3c provinces have even taught us the fact that these liquors are %0a%3c capable of being kept till they have attained a considerable %0a%3c age. Egypt,'' too, has invented for its use a very similar beve- %0a%3c rage made from corn ; indeed, in no part of the world is %0a%3c drunkenness ever at a loss. And then, besides, they take these %0a%3c drinks unmixed, and do not dilute them with water, the way %0a%3c that wine is modified ; and yet, by Hercules ! one really might %0a%3c have supposed that there the earth produced nothing but com %0a%3c for the people's use. Alas! what wondrous skill, and yet %0a%3c how misplaced ! means have absolutely been discovered for %0a%3c getting drunk upon water even. %0a%3c %0a%3c There are two liquids that are peculiarly grateful to the %0a%3c human body, Mine within and oil without; both of thera %0a%3c the produce of trees, and most excellent in their respective %0a%3c kinds. Oil, indeed, we may pronounce an absolute necessary, %0a%3c nor has mankind been slow to employ all the arts of invention %0a%3c in the manufacture of it. How much more ingenious, how- %0a%3c ever, man has shown himself in devising various kinds of %0a%3c drink will be evident from the fact, that there are no less %0a%3c %0a%3c He alludes to beer, or ratlier sweet wort, for hops were not used till %0a%3c the latter part, probably, of the middle ages. Lupines were sometimes used %0a%3c for flavouring beer. %0a%3c %0a%3c " Diodorus Siculus says that the Egyptian beer was nearly equal to %0a%3c wine in strength and flavour. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c SUMMABI. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 275 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c than one Inmdred and ninety-five different kinds of it ; in- %0a%3c deed, if all tlie varieties are reckoned, they will amount to %0a%3c nearly double that number.
