( 1 .) -INTRODUCTION. %0a%0aWe have now set forth the various properties, medicinal or %0aotherwise, as well of the cereals as of the other productions %0awhich lie u[)Oid the surface of the earth, for the purpose either %0aof serving us for food, or for the gratification of our senses %0awith their flo\vers or perfumes. lu the trees, however, %0aPomona has entered the lists with them, and has imparted %0acertain medicinal properties to the fruits as they hang. Kot con¬ %0atent with protecting and nourishing, under the shadow of the %0atrees, the various plants which w'e have* already described, %0aslie would even appear to be indignant, as it were, at the %0athought that w'^e should derive more succour from those pro¬ %0aductions which are further removed from the canopy of heaven, %0aand which have only come into use in times comparative!}' re¬ %0acent. For she bids man bear in mind that it was the fruits of %0athe trees wliich formed his fii’st nourishment, and that it was %0atliose which first led him to look upwards towards the heavens: %0aand not only this, but she reminds him, too, that even still it %0ais quite possible for him to derive his aliment from the trees, %0awithout being indebted to grain for his subsistence. %0a%0aCHAP. 2 . -THE VINE. %0a%0aBut, by Hercules ! it is the vine more particularly to wdiich %0ashe has accorded these medicinal properties, as though she %0awere not contented with her generosity in providing it w'ith %0asuch delicious flavours, and perfumes, and essences, in its om- %0aphacium, its oenanthe, and its massaris, preparations upon %0awhich W'e have already® enlarged. “ It is to me, she says, %0a“ that man is indebted for the greater part of his enjoyments, %0a%0a• In contradistinction to the fruits which hang from trees. %0a%0a* See B. xvii. c. 18. ® In xii. cc. 60 and 61. %0a%0a%0a458 %0a%0a%0aPLINy’s NA.TUUAL UI3T0IIY. %0a%0a%0a[liook XXIII, %0a%0a%0ait is I that produce for him tlie flowing wine and the trickling %0aoil, it is I that ripen the date and other fruits in numhers so %0avaried ; and all this, not insisting, like the earth, on their pur¬ %0achase at the cost of fatigues and labours. No necessity do I %0acreate for ploughing with the aid of oxen, for beating out %0aupon the threshing-floor, or for bruising under the millstone, %0aand all in order that man may earn his food at some indefinite %0atime by this vast expenditure of toil. As for me, all my gifts %0aare presented to him ready prepared: for no anxieties or %0afatigues do they call, but, on the contrary, they offer them¬ %0aselves spontaneously, and even fall to the ground, if man %0ashould be too indolent to reach them as they hang.” Vying %0aeven with herself, Pomona has done still more for our juac- %0atical advantage than for the mere gratification of our pleasures %0aand caprices. [ %0a%0a%0aCHAP. 3.—THE LEAVES AND SHOOTS OF THE VINE : SEVEN %0a%0a%0aREMEDIES. %0a%0a%0a^The leaves and shoots of the vine, employed with polenta, %0aallay head-ache and reduce inflammations :® the leaves, too, %0aapplied b}' themselves with cold water, are good for burning %0apains in the stomach ; and, used with barley-meal, are excel¬ %0alent applications for diseases of the joints. The shoots, beaten %0aup and applied, have the property of drying up all kinds of %0arunning tumours, and the juice extracted from them is used %0aas an injection for the cure of dysentery. The tears of the %0avine, M^hich would appear to be a sort of gum, will heal le¬ %0aprous sores, lichens, and itch-scabs, if treated first with nitre : %0aused with oil, and applied frequently to superfluous hairs, they %0aact as a depilatory, those more particularly which exude from %0atlie vine when burnt in a green state : this last liquid has the %0aeffect, too, of removing warts. An infusion of the shoots in %0awater, taken in drink, is good for persons troubled with spitting %0aof blood, and for the fainting fits which sometimes ensue upon %0aconception. %0a%0a* All this passage is found in Dioscorides, B. v. c. 1, who probably %0aborrowed it from the same sources as our autlior. %0a%0a* Fee remarks, that all the statements here made as to the medicinal %0aproperties of the vine arc entirely unfounded, except that with reference %0ato the bark of the vine : as it contains a small quantity of tannin, it might %0apossibly, in certain cases, arrest haemorrhage. %0a%0a%0aCliap. 4.] %0a%0a%0aOMPUACtUM. %0a%0a%0a459 %0a%0a%0aIhe bai’k of the vine and the dried leaves arrest the flo^vLng %0aof blood from wouiids, and make the sores cicatrize more %0arapidly. The juice of the white vine,® extracted from it while %0agreen, effectually removes cutaneous’ eruptions. The ashes® %0aof tlie cuttings of vines, and of the husks of the grapes, ap¬ %0aplied with vinegar, are curative of condylomata and diseases %0aof the fundament; as also of sprains, burns, and swellings of %0athe spleen, applied with rose-oil, rue, and vinegar. Used with %0awine, but without oil, they make a fomentation for erysipelas %0aand parts of the body which are chafed; they act as a depila¬ %0atory also.® For affections of the spleen the ashes of vine- %0acuttings, moistened with vinegar, are administered in drink, %0abeing taken in doses of two cyathi in warm water; after which %0atlie patient must take due care to lie upon the side in which %0athe spleen is situate. %0a%0aThe tendrils, too, which the vine throws out as it climbs, %0abeaten up in water and drunk, have the effect of arresting %0ahabitual vomiting. The ashes of the vine, used with stale %0aaxle-grease, are good for tumours, act as a detergent upon fis¬ %0atulas, and speedily effect a radical cure; the same, too, with %0apains and contractions of the sinews, occasioned by cold. Ap¬ %0aplied with oil, they are useful for contusions, and with vinegar %0aand nitre, for fleshy excrescences upon the bones : in combina¬ %0ation with oil, they are good, too, for wounds inflicted by scor¬ %0apions and dogs. The ashes of the bark, employed by them¬ %0aselves, restore the hair to such parts of the body as have suf¬ %0afered from the action of fire. %0a%0aCHAP. 4 . —OMPHACIUM EXTRACTED FROM THE VINE : FOURTEEN %0aREMEDIES. %0a%0aWe have already mentioned, when speaking of the com¬ %0aposition of unguents, how omphacium is made from the grape, %0awhen it is just beginning to form : we shall now proceed to %0aspeak of its medicinal properties. Omphacium heals ulcerations %0aof the humid parts of the body, such as the mouth, tonsillary %0a%0a« This cannot be the bryony, Fee says, but simply a variety of the gi-ape %0avine with white fruit.

The powerful action of omphacium %0ais modified by the admixture of honey or raisin wine. It is %0avery useful, too, for dysentery, spitting of blood, and quinsy. %0a%0aCHAP. 5.-CENANTHE : TWENTY-ONE REMEDIES. %0a%0a!Next to omphacium comes cenanthe, a product of the wild %0avine, described by us already ” when treating of the unguents. %0aThe most esteemed kind is that of Syria, the produce of the %0awhite vine in the vicinity of the mountains of Antiochia and %0aLaodicea in particular. Being of a cooling, astringent nature, %0ait is used for sprinkling upon sores, and is employed as a to¬ %0apical application for diseases of the stomach. It acts also as a %0adiuretic, and is good for maladies of the liver, head-ache, %0adysentery, cceliac afi'ections, and attacks of cholera ; for nausea, %0ait is taken in doses of one obolus in vinegar. It acts as a desic¬ %0acative upon running eruptions of the head, and is extremely %0aefiicacious for maladies of the humid parts of the body ; hence %0ait is that it is employed, with honey and saffron, for ulcers of %0athe mouth, and for diseases of the generative organs and the %0afundament. It arrests looseness of the bowels, and heals erup¬ %0ations of the eyelids and runnings at the eyes : taken with M’ine, %0ait cures derangements of the stomach, and with cold Avater, %0aspitting of blood. %0a%0aThe ashes of cenanthe are highly esteemed as an ingredient %0ain eye-salves, and as a detergent for ulcers, whitlows, and %0ahang-nailsto obtain these ashes, it is put into an oven, and %0aleft there till the bread is thoroughly baked. %0a%0aSaracemis, upon Dioscorides, B. v. c. 6, thinks that Pliny, in copying %0afrom the Greek, has made a mistake hei'e, and that he lias taken ovXuv, %0athe “gums,” for ov\t), u “cicatrix;” the corresponding passage in %0aDioscorides being ovXa TrXaSupa, “flaccidity,” or “humidity of the %0agums.” %0a%0aIn B. xii. c. 61. See also B. xiii. c. 2, B, xiv. c. 18, and B, xv. c. 7. %0aCEiianthc, or vine-blossom, possesses no active medicinal properties, and %0athe statements made here by Pliny are in all probability unfounded. %0a%0aNot the white vine, or Bryonia alba of modern botany, but probably %0asome variety of the cultivated vine with white fruit. The flower of the %0abryony is inodorous, and would be of no utility in the composition of %0aperfumes. “Pterygia.” %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 6.] %0a%0a%0aPllESEUVtD GRAPES. %0a%0a%0a461 %0a%0a%0aAs to inassaris,’® it is used as a perfume only. The renown %0aattached to all these preparations is due solely to the innate %0agreediness of mankind, which has racked its invention to gather %0athe productions of the earth before they have arrived at ma¬ %0aturity. %0a%0aCriAP. 6.—GRAPES, FRESH GATHERED. %0a%0aAs to grapes when allowed to gain maturity, the black ones %0ahave more marked properties than the others ; and hence it %0ais, tliat the wine made from them is not so agreeable. The %0awhite grapes, on the other hand, are sweeter, for, being trans¬ %0aparent, the air penetrates them with greater facility. %0a%0aGrapes fresh gathered are productive of flatulency, and dis¬ %0aturb the stomach and bowels; hence it is that the}' are avoided %0ain fevers, in large quantities more ])articularly. Indeed, they %0aare very apt to produce oppression of the head, and to bring on %0athe malady known as lethargy.” Grapes which have been %0agathered, and hdt to hang for some time, are much less'® hiju- %0arioiis, the exposure to the air rendering them beneficial even to %0athe stomach, and refreshing to the patient, as they are slightly %0acooling, and tend to remove nausea and qualmishness. %0a%0aCHAP. 7 . -VARIOUS KINDS OF PRESERVED GRAPES : ELEVEN %0a%0aFtEMEDIES. %0a%0aGrapes which have been preserved in w'ine or in must are %0atri'ing to the head, Next to the grapes which have been left %0ato hang in the air, are those which have been kept in chaff; %0abut as to those which have been preserved among grape husks, %0athey are injuriousto the head, the bladder, and the stomach. %0a%0aSee B. xii. c. 61. It was prepared from vine-blossoms gathered in %0aAfrica. %0a%0aTills remark is founded, in a great measure, upon fact. The skin of %0athe black grape contains a colouring principle in consider.able abundance, %0aand a small proportion of tannin ; that of tlie white grape possesses no %0acolouring principle, but a considerable quantity of tannin. The white %0agrape contains more saccharine matter than the black one, and they aro %0aboth of them of a laxative nature. %0a%0a” Little remarks, that under the name of “ lethargus,” a febrile m.alady %0ais probably meant, which belongs p>'obably to the class of pseudo-con¬ %0atinuous fevers. %0a%0aFee thinks that in reality there can be little or no difference in rheir %0aeffects, but that, being eaten in larger quantities at the vintage than after¬ %0awards, it stands to reason that the result will be different. %0a%0a’s The fermentation, producing a certain amount of alcohol, would %0anaturally produce this result. %0a%0a%0a462 %0a%0a%0aPliny’s natuhal uistouy. %0a%0a%0a[Buok XXIII. %0a%0a%0athough at the same time they arrest looseness of the bowels, %0aand are extremely good for patients troubled with spitting of %0ablood. When preserved in must, they are worse even in their %0aeffects than when kept among husks; boiled ^ must, too, ren¬ %0aders them injurious to the stomach. It is the opinion of medical %0awriters, that grapes kept*' in rain-water are the most whole¬ %0asome of all, even though they are by no means agreeable eating; %0afor the benefit of them is particularly experienced in burning %0apains of the stomach, biliousness arising from a disordered liver, %0avomiting of bile, and attacks of cholera, as also dropsy and %0aburning fevers. %0a%0aGrapes kept in earthen pots sharpen the taste, the stomach, %0aand the appetite; it is thought, however, that they are ren¬ %0adered a little heavy ** by the exhalations from the husks with %0awhich they are covered.** If vine-blossoms are given to %0apoultry, mixed with their food, they will never touch the %0agrapes.*' %0a%0aCHAP. 8.—CUTTINGS OF THE VINE : ONE REMEDY. %0a%0aSuch cuttings of the vine as have borne grapes, have an %0aastringent effect, when they are preserved in earthen *® pots, %0amore particularly. %0a%0aCHAP. 9.—GRAPE-STONES : SIX REMEDIES. %0a%0aGrape-stones, also, have a similar *® property ; it is through %0athem that wine is so apt to produce head-ache. Parched and %0athen pounded, they are beneficial for the stomach ; and this %0apowder is spidnkled, like polenta, in the beverage of patients %0asuffering from dysentery, coeliac affections, and derangements %0aof the stomach. A decoction of them is useful, also, as a fo¬ %0amentation for itch-scabs and prurigo. %0a%0a2® “ Sapamust boiled down to one-third. %0a%0a2* This, as Fee remarks, is quite impossible; grapes put in rain-water %0awould spoil immediately, and become totally unfit to eat. %0a%0aBy the transformation, namely, of the juices into alcohol. %0a%0a2® See B. xiv. c. 3. %0a%0a2* A notion quite unfounded, as Fee remarks. See B. xiv. c. 18. %0a%0a23 A prejudice equally destitute of foundation. %0a%0a2fi Grape-stones have an astringent effect, and Fee states that in modern %0atimes an oil is extracted from them of an agreeable fiavour, and applicable %0ato many economical purposes. They are no longer used in medicine. %0a%0a%0aChap. 12.] %0a%0a%0ahaisixs. %0a%0a%0a463 %0a%0a%0aCHAP, 10. —GEAPR-IIUSKS : EIGHT REMEDIES. %0a%0aGrape-husks, used by themselves, are less injurious to the %0ahead and bladder than grape-stones are : beaten up with salt, %0athey form an excellent liniment for inflammations of the ma- %0aniillse. A decoction of them, taken in drink, or employed as %0aa fomentation, is good for inveterate dysentery, and coeliac af¬ %0afections. %0a%0aCHAP. 11.-THE GHAPES OF THE THEKIACA : FOUR REMEDIES. %0a%0aThe grape of the theriaca, of which we have already made %0amention*’ on the appropriate occasion, is eaten by way of anti¬ %0adote to the stings of serpents. It is recommended, too, to eat %0athe j’oung shoots of this tree, and to apply them topically. %0aThe wine and vinegar made from these grapes are productive %0aof a similar salutary effect.*® %0a%0aCHAP. 12. —RAISINS, OR ASTAPHIS : FOURTEEN REMEDIES. %0a%0aRaisins, the name given to which is “ astaphis,” would be %0ainjurious to the stomach, abdomen, and intestines, were it not %0afor the stones within them, which act as a corrective.*® When %0athe stones are removed, raisins, it is thought, are beneficial to %0athe bladder, and good for cough in the last case, the raisin %0aof the white grape is considered the best. Raisins are good %0aalso for the trachea and the kidneys, and the wine made from %0athem is particularly efiicacious for the sting of the serpent %0acalled haemorrhois.®’ In combination with meal of cummin or %0acoriander, they are employed topically for inflammations of the %0atestes. For carbuncles and diseases of the joints, the stones %0aare remoAmd, and the raisins are pounded with rue; if used %0afor ulcers, the sores must be first fomented with wine. %0a%0aUsed with the stones, raisins are a cure for epinyctis, honey¬ %0acomb ulcers,** and dysentery; and for gangrenes they are applied %0atopically with radish rind and honey, being first boiled in oil. %0aThey are used with panax,** for gout and loose nails; and they %0a%0aIn B. xiv. c. 22. j i %0a%0a28 Hence the name “ theriaca,” from ei/p, a “ wild animal,” and uKtopai, %0a“ to cure.” %0a%0a28 Hy reason, probably, of their astringent properties. %0a%0a8® Though no longer used medicinally, they are still considered to be %0agood pectorals.

It has a black, ujmight stem, with %0aleaves resembling those of the labrusca,^ and bears what we may %0acall a pod,^’ rather than a grape, green, similar to a chick-pea %0ain appearance, and enclosing a kernel of triangular form. The %0afruit of it ripens with the vintage and turns black, while the %0aberries of the taminia,^® as is well known, are red ; this last, %0atoo, as we are aware, grows only in shaded spots, while the %0awild astaphis, on the other hand, loves a site that is exposed %0ato the sun. %0a%0aI Avould not recommend any one to use the kernels’'' of the %0awild astaphis as a purgative, as it is very doubtful whether they %0amight not choke the patient; nor would I advise them to be %0aemployed for the purpose of attenuating the phlegm, as they %0aare extremelj’^ irritating to the throat. Ileaten up, however, and %0aapplied topically, they kill vermin''® in the head and other parts %0aof the body, more particularly if they are used with sanda- %0arach; they are very useful, too, for itch-scabs and prurigo. A %0adecoction of the kernels is made with vinegar, for the cure of %0atooth-ache, diseases of the ears, cicatrices^' that are slow in %0ahealing, and running sores. %0a%0aThe blossoms of the plant are beaten up and taken in wine %0a%0a^ Identified with the Delphinium staphis agria of Linnajus. %0a%0a“Taininian grape.” Or wild vine. %0a%0aThe fruit is formed of three ohlong capsules, containing a triangular %0aseed of black hrown colour, about the size of a kidney bean. %0a%0aThis is not the white vine or bryony, mentioned in c. 16 of this %0aBook, but the Tamus communis of Linnaeus. %0a%0aThe seeds, which are remarkably pungent and powerful in tlicir %0aeflfects, are only used, at the present day, in medicinal preparations for %0acattle. %0a%0aThis is still done at the present day; to which it is indebted for its* %0aFrench name I’herbe pediculaire, or louse-plant. %0a%0aPliny seems again to have fallen into the error , of mistaking ov\ov, %0athe “ gums ” for oo\/), a “cicatrix the corresponding passage in Dios- %0acorides, B. iv. c.

Some persons give to this plant the name %0aof “ pituitaria,”^® and use it as a common application lor %0astings inflicted by serpents. %0a%0aCHAP. 14 . - THE LABKUSCA, OU WILD TINE : TWEI.TE REMEDIES. %0a%0aThe labrusca, too, produces an (Enanthe, which has been %0adescribed at sufficient length already by the Greeks the la- %0abriisca is known as the wild vine.^® The leaves of it are thick %0aaud of a whitish colour, the stem is jointed, and the bark fuU %0aof fissures : it bears grapes of a scarlet*® hue, like the coccus, %0awhich are made use of by females for the purpose of improving %0athe complexion, and removing spots upon the face. Pounded %0awith the leaves and the juice extracted from the tree, these %0agrapes are usefully employed for the treatment of lumbago %0aand sciatica. A decoction of the root*' in water, taken in two %0acyathi of Goan wine, promotes an alvine evacuation of aqueous %0asecretions; for whicli reason it is prescribed for dropsy.* %0a%0aI am inclined to think that this is the plant that is com¬ %0amonly known as the “uva taminia;’’*® it is in great request as %0aan amulet, and is employed, though as a gargle only, in cases %0aof spitting blood; for which purpose, salt, thyme, and oxymel %0aare added to it, care being taken not to swallow any of the %0amixture. It is generally looked upon as nnsafe to employ it as %0aa purgative. %0a%0aCHAP. 15 . -THE S-ALICASTRUM : TWELVE REMEDIES. %0a%0aThere is another plant,*® similar to the labrusca, but found %0aThey would be of no use whatever, Fee says, for such a purpose. %0a%0a*^ As tending to carry off “ pituita,” or phlegm. %0a%0a** In B. .vii. c. 61. %0a%0a*'’ “Ampelos agria.” Fee observes, that this Chapter is full of errors, %0aPliny beginning by speaking of the wild vine, the variety Labrusca of the %0aVitis vinifera of Linnajus, and then proceeding to describe what is really %0athe Bryonia dioica of modern botany, and applying its characteristics to %0athe wild vine, or labrusca. %0a%0aThis is not the case with the wild vine. %0a%0a*’ The root of the wild vine is not of a purgative nature. %0a%0a*® As already stated, tliis is not identical with the wild vine, but is the %0aTamus communis of Linnaeus. %0a%0a*® The Solanum dulcamara of modern botany has been suggested; %0athough there is but little resemblance between the leaves of that variety of %0anightshade and those of the wild vine. %0a%0aVOL.

The twigs of this tree are %0ajointed, thin, and climbing, with considerable interstices be¬ %0atween the knots.®‘ The leaves, attached to the numerous %0ashoots, and about the size of an ivy leaf, are jagged at the %0aedges, like that of the vine. The root of it is large and white, %0aand very like a radish®’^ at first; from it issue several steins, %0asimilar to asparagus in appearance. These stems, eaten boiled, %0aare both purgative and diuretic. The leaves, too, as well as %0athe stems, are possessed of caustic®® properties; for which %0areason they are employed topically with salt, for phagedaenic %0asores, gangrenes, and putrid ulcers of the legs. The fruit of %0athe tree is in the form of grapes thinly scattered, the juice of %0awhich is red at first, and afterwards of a saffron colour. This %0afruit®® is well known to curriers, who are in the habit of using %0ait in preparing leather. It is employed also in the form of a %0aliniment for itch-scabs and leprous spots; and a decoction of %0ait with wheat, taken in drink, increases the milk in women %0awhen nursing. The root of this tree, so renowned for %0athe numerous medicinal purposes to which it is applied, is %0apounded and taken in wine, in doses of two drachmae, for the %0acure of stings inflicted by serpents :®® it has the effect, also, of %0a%0a50 The Bryonia alba of Linnaeus ; the bryony, white vine, or white jalap. %0a%0a51 This description, Fee says, is pretty correct, and the account of its %0aproperties sufficiently exact. It is a violent poison, and is no longer used %0ain medicine. %0a%0a5- It is still called by the French navet du diabk, or devil’s turnip. %0a%0a53 “ Exulcerant corjms.” Our author. Fee says, may here be taxed %0awith some exaggeration. %0a%0a51 The fruit is no longer used for this purpose. %0a%0a55 It is a matter of extreme doubt if there is any foundation for this %0astatement. %0a%0a%0aCkp. 16.] %0a%0a%0aTUE WHITE TINE. %0a%0a%0a467 %0a%0a%0aremoving spots upon the face, moles and freckles, as well as %0agears and bruises: a decoction of it in oil is productive of a %0asimilar effect. A decoction of it is given to drink for epi¬ %0alepsy,“ and to persons troubled Avitb a disordered mind or %0asuffering from vertigo, the dose being one drachma daily, for a %0awhole year: taken in larger quantities, it is apt sometimes to %0adisorder*’ the senses.

An electu¬ %0aary is prepared from it for asthma and pains in the sides, as %0aalso for convulsions and ruptures. Taken in drink for thirty %0adays together, in doses of three oboli, it has the effect of re¬ %0aducing the spleen; and it is used, in combination with figs, %0afor the cure of hangnails*® on the fingers. Applied with wine, %0ait brings away the after-birth, and, taken in hydromel, in %0adoses of one drachma, it carries off phlegm. The juice of the %0aroot should be extracted before the fruit ripens; applied either %0aby itself or with meal of fitches, it imparts an improved com¬ %0aplexion and a certain degree of suppleness to the skin: it has %0athe effect also of repelling serpents. The root itself, too, %0abeaten up with a pulpy fig, will remove wrinkles on the body, %0aif the person using it takes care to walk a couple of stadia im¬ %0amediately after the application; otherwise it would leave marks %0aupon the skin, unless, indeed, it were washed off immediately %0awith cold water. The black vine, too, is better for this pur¬ %0apose than the white one, as the latter is very apt to be pro¬ %0aductive of itching. %0a%0a^ It would be productive of no good effect in such case, nor, indeed, iu %0amost of the cases here mentioned. %0a%0a*’ “Purgat" is the reading given by Sillig; but, judging jrom^t.ie cor¬ %0aresponding passage in Dioscoridcs, iworapdrrtt, *• turbat,’^^or “ contur- %0abat,” is the proper reading. *® “ Ptcrygiis. %0a%0a%0an n 2 %0a%0a%0a468 %0a%0a%0aflint’s NATUEAL niSTORT. %0a%0a%0a[Book XXIII. %0a%0a%0aCItAP. 17 . —THE BLACK VINE, OTHERWISE CALLED BRTONA, CHl- %0a%0aliONlA, GTNJECANTHE, OR APRONIA I THIRTY-FIVE REMEDIES. %0a%0aFor there is also a black vine, properly known as the “bry- %0aonia,”®® though by some persons it is called the “ chironia,” %0aand by others the “ gymecanthe,” or “ apronia.” It differs only %0afrom the one previously mentioned in its colour, which, as %0aalready stated,®® is black.

It is found growing in shrubberies or %0areed-beds more particularly. The root of it, which is black %0aoutside, and of the colour of box within, is even more efiBeacious %0afor the extraction of splintered bones than the plant last men¬ %0ationed ; iu addition to which, it has the property of being a %0aspecific for excoriations of the neck in cattle.

There is no subject %0athat presents greater difficulties than this, or, indeed, a more %0avaried field for discussion, it being extremel}' difficult to pro¬ %0anounce whether wine is more generally injurious in its effects, %0aor beneficial.

It is impossible, with any degree of accu¬ %0aracy, to discuss' the properties of these various wines, as they no longer %0aexist. %0a%0a%0a%0a470 plixt’s natural history. [Book XXIII. %0a%0aAsclepiades lias composed a whole treatise (which ha.s %0athence received its name'^) on the proper methods of adminis¬ %0atering wine ; and the number of commentators who have since %0awritten on this treatise, is almost innumerable. For my own %0apart, with all that gravity which becomes a Roman, and one %0azealous for the furtherance of liberal pursuits, I shall enter into a %0acareful examination of this subject, not, indeed, in the cha¬ %0aracter of a physician, but as a careful investigator of the %0aeffects which wine is likely to produce upon the health of man¬ %0akind. To treat, however, of the medicinal properties of each %0aindividual kind, would be a labour without end, and quite in¬ %0aexhaustible ; the more so, as the opinions of medical men are %0aso entirely at variance upon the subject. %0a%0aCHAP. 20. -THE SUKRENTINE AVINES : THREE REMEDIES. THE %0a%0aALBAN WINES : TWO REMEDIES. THE FAIERNIAN WINES : SIX %0a%0aREMEDIES. %0a%0aOur ancestors set the highest value upon the wines of %0aSurrentum but at a later period the preference was given %0ato the Alban, or the Falernian wines. More recently, again, %0aother varieties of wine have come into fashion, quite in accord¬ %0aance with that most unreasonable mode of proceeding, ac¬ %0acording to which, each person, as he finds a wine most to his %0ataste, extols it as superior to all others. Suppose, now, that all %0apersons were quite agreed as to the superiority of some par¬ %0aticular kind of wine, how small a proportion of mankind %0awould be enabled to make use of it! As it is, even the rich never %0adrink it in an unsophisticated state; the morals of the age %0abeing such, that it is the name only of a vintage that is sold, %0athe wines being adulterated the very moment they enter the %0avat. Hence it is, by Hercules !—a thing truly astounding— %0athat, in reality, a Avine is more innoxious in its effects, in pro¬ %0aportion as it enjoys a less extended renoAvn. The three kinds, %0ahowever, of which we have made mention, appear to have %0amaintained, with the least diminution, their ancient repute. %0a%0aThe Falernian Avine, if a person should be desirous to know %0athe marked characteristics of Avines according to age, is in¬ %0ajurious to the health, either too new or too old; at fifteen %0a%0a“ Cognoniinatum” appears to be a better reading than “ cognomi- %0anatus,” Avbich Sillig has adopted; as it is much more probable that the %0awork received its name from the subject than that the writer did. %0a%0aAll these wines are described in B. xiv. %0a%0a%0aChap. 22.] %0a%0a%0aOTnER WIIJES. %0a%0a%0a471 %0a%0a%0ayears it begins to be of medium age.

There is no wine that %0a(juickens the action of the venous system so much as this ; it %0aacts astringently upon the bowels, and is feeding to the body. %0aIt has been thought, however, that this wine is productive of %0ainjurj' to the sight, and that it is far from beneficial to the %0anerves’® and the bladder. %0a%0aThe Alban wines are more salutary to the nervous system, %0abut the sweet kinds are not so beneficial to the stomach. The %0arough wines of Alba are even better than those of Falernum, %0abut they do not promote the digestion so well, and have a %0aslight tendency to overload the stomach. %0a%0aAs to the Surrentine wines, they have no such effect upon %0athe stomach, nor are they at all trying to the head ; they have %0athe property also of arresting defluxions of the stomach and %0aintestines. The Csecuban wines are no longer grown. %0a%0aCHAP. 21. -THE SETINE WINES ; ONE OBSERVATION UPON THEM. %0a%0aTHE STATAN WINES ; ONE OBSERVATION UPON THEM.

The %0awines of Falernum are not so powerful. Those of Stata are %0abut very little inferior in quality to the wines already men¬ %0ationed. It is universally agreed that the wines of Signia are %0aextremely beneficial in cases of derangement of the bowels. %0a%0aCHAP. 22. —OTHER wines: sixty-four remedies. %0a%0aAs to the other wines, they may be spoken of in general %0aterms. By the use of wine, the human vigour, blood, and %0acomplexion are improved. It is w'ine that makes up for all %0athe difference between the middle or temperate zone, and those %0awhich lie on either side of it, the juice of the vine conferring %0aas much vigour and robustness upon the inliabitants of our %0apart of the earth as the rigorousness” of the climate does %0a%0a75 %3c1 Nervis.” As to the meaning of this word, see B. xi. c. 88. %0a%0a'‘® These wines also are described in B. xiv. %0a%0au “ Feritas.’* %0a%0a%0a472 %0a%0a%0aPLlNl’s NATUEAL IIISTOEV. %0a%0a%0a[Look XXII I. %0a%0a%0aupon tlie people there. Milk, used as a beverage, strengthens %0athe bones, liquids extracted from the cerc'als nourish the %0asinews, and water imparts nutriment to the flesh : hence it is %0athat persons who confine themselves to these several liquids as %0aa beverage, are of a less ruddy complexion than the wine- %0adrinker, less robust, and less able to endure fatigue. By the %0ause of wine in moderation the sinews are strengthened, but %0ataken in excess it proves injurious to them; the same, too, %0awith the eyes. Wine refreshes the stomach, sharpens the %0aappetite, takes off the keen edge of sorrows and anxieties, %0awarms the body, acts beneficially as a diuretic, and invites %0asleep. In addition to these properties, it arrests vomiting, and %0awe find that pledgets of wool, soaked in wine, and applied to %0aabscesses, are extremely beneficial. According to Asclepiades, %0athe virtues possessed by wine are hardly equalled by the ma¬ %0ajestic attributes of the gods themselves. %0a%0aOld wine bears admixture with a larger quantity of water, and %0aacts more powerfully as a diuretic, though at the same time it %0ais less effectual for quenching thirst. Sweet wine, again, is %0aless inebriating, but stays longer on the stomach, while rough %0awine is more easy of digestion. The wine that becomes mcd- %0alow with the greatest rapidity is the lightest, and that which %0abecomes sweeter the older it is, is not so injurious to tlie %0anerves. Wines that are rich and black,’® are not so bene¬ %0aficial to the stomach ; butj at the same time, they are more %0afeeding to the body. Thin-bodied rough wines are not so %0afeeding, but are more wholesome to the stomach, and pass %0aoff more speedily by urine, though they are all the more %0aliable to fly to the head; a remark which will apply, once for %0aall, to liquids of every kind. %0a%0aWine that has been mellowed by the agency of smoke is %0aextremely unwholesome—a fraudulent method of preparation %0athat has been invented in the wine-lofts’® of the retail dealers. %0aAt the present day, however, this plan is adopted in private %0afamilies even, when it is wished to give the appearance of ma¬ %0aturity to wines that have become carious.®® Indeed, this term %0acarious has been used very appositely by the ancients wfith %0areference to wines ; for we find that in the case of wood even, %0asmoke exercises a caustic effect upon the carious parts, and %0a%0a''® The colour of our Port. %0a%0a“ Aputhcuis.” %0a%0a%0a•"O “ Caricm trahunt.’ %0a%0a%0aChap. 23.] OB3ERVATIOK8 EELATIVE TO WINE. %0a%0a%0a473 %0a%0a%0aeats them awaj'-; and yet we, on the other hand, persuade %0aourselves tliat an adventitious age may be imparted to wines %0aby the bitter twang derived from smoke !®‘ %0a%0aThose wines which are extremely pale, become more whole¬ %0asome the older they are. The more generous®^ a wine is, the %0athicker it becomes with age; while, at the same time, it %0acontracts a bitter flavour, which is far from t'xercising a bene¬ %0aficial efi'ect upon the health. To season another wine, that is %0anot so old, with this, is nothing less than to make an unwhole¬ %0asome preparation. The more of its own natural flavour®® a %0awine possesses, the more wholesome it is; and the best age for %0aa wine is that which naturally belongs to it, a medium age %0abeing the one that is the most generally esteemed. %0a%0a%0aCHAP. 23. -SIXTY-ONE OBSEllVATIONS EELATIVE TO WINE. %0a%0a%0aPersons whose wish it is to make flesh, or to keep the bowels %0arelaxed, will do well to drink while taking their food. Those, %0aon the other hand, who wish to reduce themselves, or prevent %0athe bowels from being relaxed, should abstain from drinking %0awhile taking their meals, and drink but a very little only %0awhen they have done eating.

A mix¬ %0ature of numerous kinds of wine is universally bad, and the %0amost wholesome wine of all is that to which no ingredient has %0abeen added when in a state of must; indeed, it is still better %0aif the vessels even in which it is kept have never been pitched.®’ %0aAs to wines which have been treated with marble, gj'psum, %0aor lime,®® where is the man, however robust he may be, that %0ahas not stood in dread of them ? %0a%0aWines which have been prepared Avith sea-water®® are par¬ %0aticularly injurious to the stomach, nerves, and bladder. Those %0awhich have been seasoned with resin are generally looked %0aupon as beneficial to a cold stomach, but are considered unsuit-^ %0aable where there is a tendency to vomit: the same, too, with %0amust, boiled grape-juice,’ and raisin Avine. NeAV wines sea¬ %0asoned Avith resin are good for no one, being productive of %0avertigo and head-ache: hence it is that the name of “ cra- %0apula” ^ has been given equall}’’ to neAV resined Avines, and to %0athe surfeit and head-ache which they produce. %0a%0aThe wines above mentioned ® by name, are good for cough %0aand catarrh, as also for coeliac affections, dysentery, and %0athe catamenia.

In cases of acute %0afever, wine must never be given, under any cireumstance, %0aexcept when there is an evident remission of the attack, and %0amore particularly if this takes place in the night, for then the %0adanger is diminished by one half, there being the probability %0aof the patient sleeping off the effects of the wine. It is equally %0aforbidden, also, to females just after delivery or a miscarriage, %0aand to patients suffering from over-indulgence of the sexual %0apassions ; nor should it be given in cases of head-ache, of %0amaladies in which the attacks are attended with chills at the %0aextremities, of fever accompanied with cough, of tremulous¬ %0aness ® in the sinews, of pains in the fauces, or where the disease %0ais found to concentrate itself in the iliac regions. Wine is %0astrictly forbidden, too, in cases of induration of the thoracic %0aorgans, violent throbbings of the veins, opisthotony, tetanus, %0aasthma, and hardness of breathing attended with fever. %0a%0aWine is far from beneficial for a patient, when the eyes are %0afixed and rigid, and when the eyelids are immoveable, or else %0arelaxed and heavy; in cases, too, where, with an incessant nic¬ %0atation, the eyes are more than usually brilliant, or where the %0aeyelids refuse to close—the same, too, if that symptom %0ashould occur in sleep—or where the eyes are suff“used with %0ablood, or congealed matter makes its appearance in the corners %0aof those organs. The same rule should be observed, also, when %0athe tongue is heavj’^ and swollen, or when ‘there is an impedi¬ %0ament from time to time in the speech, when the urine is passed %0awith difficulty, or when a person has been seized with a sudden %0afright, with spasms, or recurrent fits of torpor, or experiences %0aseminal discharges during sleep. %0a%0a® See B. xiv. cc. 3, 4. %0a%0a7 See B. xiv. c. 4; Vol. III. p. 227. %0a%0a8 “ Tremore nervorum perhaps “nervousness.” %0a%0a%0aClmp. 26.] %0a%0a%0aAUTIl'ICIAL AVIXEa. %0a%0a%0a477 %0a%0a%0aCHAP. 25. -KlNETy-ONK OTJSEltVATIOKS WITH REFERENCE TO %0a%0aAVINE. %0a%0aIt is a well-ascertaiued fact, that in the cardiac ® disease the %0aonly resource is Avine.

Wine is better suited to mules than to %0afemales, to aged people than to youths, to youths than to chil¬ %0adren, and to persons Avho are used to it than to those Avho are %0ajiot in the habit of taking it; Avinter, too, is a better time for %0ausing it than summer. As to the quantity to be prescribed, %0aand the proportion of Avater to be mixed Avith it, that depends %0aentirely upon the strength of the Avine; it is generally thought, %0ahoAvever, that the best proportions are one cyathus of Avine and %0atAVO of Avater.

To arrest the %0ahaemorrhage which ensues upon the operation^* of lithotomy, %0aand, indeed, all other operations of a similar nature, it is usual %0ato apply vinegar in a sponge, and at the same time to admin¬ %0aister it internally in doses of two cyathi, the very strongest %0apossible being employed. Vinegar has the effect also of %0adissolving coagulated blood ; for the cure of lichens, it is used %0aboth internally and externally. Used as an injection, it ar¬ %0arests looseness of the bowels and fluxes of the intestines; it is %0asimilarly employed, too, for procidenceof the rectum and utei’us. %0a%0aVinegar acts as a cure for inveterate coughs, defluxions of %0athe throat, hardness of breathing, and looseness of the teeth: %0abut it acts injuriously upon the bladder and the sinews, when %0arelaxeil. Medical men were for a long time in ignorance how %0abeneficial vinegar is for the sting of the asp ; lor it was only %0arecently that a man, while carrying a bladder^ of vinegar, hap¬ %0apening to be stung by an asp upon which he trod, found to his %0asurprise that whenever he put down the bladder he felt the sting, %0abut that when he took it up again, he seemed as though he %0ahad never been hurt; a circumstance which at once suggested %0ato him the remedial properties of the vinegar, upon drinking %0asome of which he experienced a cure.

A decoction of wine-lees is pre¬ %0apared, too, with barley-meal and powdered frankincense ; after %0aAvhich it is first parched and then dried. The test of its being %0aproperly boiled, is its imparting, when cold, a burning sensa¬ %0ation to the tongue. When left exposed to the air, wine-lees %0avery rapidly lose their virtues ; which, on the other hand, are %0agreatly heightened by the action of fire. %0a%0aWine-lees are very useful, too, boiled with figs, for the cure %0a%0aSee c. 18 of this Book.

It has been silggested, however, that Pliny has com¬ %0amitted an error here, and that in copying from the Greek source he has %0amistaken the author’s mention of the cure of lichens by the gum of the %0aplum-tree, for an account of a lichen which grows on the tree. Such, in %0afact, is the statement of Dioscorides in B. i, c. 174, though he does not %0amention chaps and condylomata. %0a%0a%0aChap. 71.] %0a%0a%0aSTOMatice. %0a%0a%0a509 %0a%0a%0astated,* mulberry-trees of a peculiar kind, being of a nature %0athat is truly marvellous; for, if the outer bark is peeled off, %0athey emit a great abundance of juice ; but if a deeper inci¬ %0asion is made, they are found to be quite dry.* This juice is %0aan antidote to the venom of serpimts, is good for dysentery, %0adisperses inflamed tumours and all kinds of gatherings, heals %0awounds, and allays both head-ache and ear-ache: it is taken %0ain drink for aftections of the spleen, and is used as a liniment %0afor the same purpose, as also for fits of shivering. This juice, %0ahowever, very soon breeds worms. %0a%0aAmong ourselves, too, the juice which exudes from the %0amulberry-tree is employed for an equal number of purposes : %0ataken in wine, it neutralizes the noxious effects of aconite^ and %0athe venom of spiders, relaxes the bowels, and expels tape¬ %0aworm and other animals which breed in the intestines the %0abark of the tree, pounded, has also a similar effect. The %0aleaves, boiled in rain-water with the bark of the black fig and %0athe vine, are used for dyeing the hair. %0a%0aThe juice of the fruit has a laxative effect immediately upon %0athe bowels, though the fruit itself, for the moment, acts bene¬ %0aficially upon the stomach, being of a refreshing nature, but pro¬ %0aductive of thirst. If no other food is taken upon them, mul¬ %0aberries® are of a swelling tendency. The juice of unripe mul¬ %0aberries acts astringently upon the bowels.

There is no medica¬ %0ament known that is more soothing than this, for affections of %0athe mouth, the trachea, the uvula, and the stomach. There %0ais also another mode of preparing it; two sextarii of mulberry %0ajuice and one of Attic honey are boiled down in the manner %0aabove stated. %0a%0aThere are some other marvellous properties, also, which are %0amentioned in reference to this tree. AYhen the tree is in bud, %0aand before the appearance of the leaves, the germs of the fruit %0amust be gathered with the left hand—the Greeks give them %0athe name of “ricini.”^® These germs, worn as an amulet %0abefore they have touched the ground, have the effect of arrest¬ %0aing haemorrhage, whether proceeding from a wound, from the %0amouth, from the nostrils, or from piles ; for which purposes %0athey are, accordingly, put away and kept. Similar virtues %0aare attributed to a branch just beginning to bear, broken off at %0afull moon, provided also it lias not touched the ground : this %0abranch, it is said, attached to the arm, is peculiarly efficacious %0afor the suppression of the catamenia when in excess. The %0asame effect is produced, it is said, when the woman herself %0apulls it off, whatever time it may happen to be, care being %0ataken not to let it touch the ground, and to wear it attached to %0athe body. The leaves of the mulberry-tree beaten up fresh, %0aor a decoction of tliem dried, are applied topically for stings %0ainflicted by serpents: an infusion of them, taken in drink, is %0aequally efficacious for that purpose. The juice extracted from %0athe bark of the root, taken in wine or oxycrate, counteracts %0athe venom of the scorpion. %0a%0aWe must also give some account of the method of preparing %0athis medicament employed by the ancients : extracting the %0ajuice from the fruit, both ripe and unripe, they mixed it to¬ %0agether, and then boiled it down in a copper vessel to the con- %0a%0a^ See B. xii. c. 60.

Such was their receipt for %0athe stomatice, which was also employed by them to promote %0athe cicatrization of wounds. There was another method, also, %0aof dealing with the juice of this fruit: extracting the juice, %0athey used the dried fruit with various articles of food,^‘ as %0atending to heighten the flavour; and they were in the habit %0aof employing it medicinally'^ for corroding ulcers, pituitous %0aexpectorations, and all cases in which astringents were re¬ %0aquired for the viscera.

A third mode of employing the juices of %0athis tree is to boil down the leaves and root, the decoclion %0abeing used, Avith oil,'"* as a liniment for the cure of burns. %0aThe leaves are also applied by themselves for the same %0apurpose. %0a%0aAn incision made in the root at harvest-time, supplies a %0ajuice that is extremely useful for tooth-ache, gatherings, and %0asuppurations; it acts, also, as a purgative upon the bowels. %0aMulberry-leaves, macerated in urine, remove the hair from %0ahides. %0a%0a%0aCHAP. 72.— CHEliRIES: FIVE OBSERVATIONS HPON THEM. %0a%0a%0aCherries are relaxing to the bowels and unAvholesome'^ to %0athe stomach; in a dried state, however, they are astringent %0aand diuretic.'® I find it stated by some authors, that if %0acherries are taken early in the morning covered Avith dew, %0athe kernels being eaten Avith them, the boAvels will be so %0astrongly acted upon as to effect a cure for gout in the feet. %0a%0a%0a>1 From the account given by Dioscorides, B. i. c. 181, this appears to %0abe the meaning of the passage, which is very elliptically expressed, if, in¬ %0adeed, it is not imperfect. . , , ta- -j %0a%0a>2 In a powdered state, probably, as mentioned by Dioscorides. %0a%0aThe use of the word “ conluebaiit” would almost make it appear that %0a%0ahe is speaking of a liquid. • j- .n %0a%0a•3' The iuice (if indeed, Pliny intends to specify it as an ingredient) %0awill not, as Fee remarks, combine with oil.

The kernels, %0aalso, have a similar effect when eaten, though not in so marked %0aa degree. When fresh gathered, they are most agreeable %0aeating ; for when drj'^, they are more oleaginous, unwholesome %0ato the stomach, difficult of digestion, productive of head-ache, %0aand bad for cough,®^ or for a person when about to take an emetic %0afasting: they are good in cases of tenesmus only, as they carry %0aoff the pituitous humours of the body. Eaten beforehand, they %0adeaden the effects of poison, and, employed with rue and oil, %0athey are a cure for quins)’’. They act as a corrective, also, to %0aonions, and modify their flavour. They are applied to inflam¬ %0amations of the ears, with a little honey, and with rue they are %0aused for affections of the mamillae, and for sprains. With %0aonions, salt, and honey, they are applied to bites inflicted by %0adogs or human beings. Walnut-shells are used for cauteri¬ %0azing ®® carious teeth; and with these shells, burnt and then %0abeaten up in oil or wine, the heads of infants are anointed, %0athey having a tendency to make the hair grow; hence they %0aare used in a similar manner for alopeey also.

Two of %0athe berries with the skin removed, taken in wine, are a cure %0afor inveterate cough and hardness of breathing; if, however, %0athis is accompanied with fever, they are given in water, or %0aelse in an electuary with raisin wine, or boiled in hydromel. %0aEmployed in a similar manner, they are good for phthisis, and %0afor all defluxions of the chest, as they have the effect of %0adetaching the phlegm and bringing it off. %0a%0aFor stings inflicted by scorpions, four laurel-berries are %0ataken in wine. Applied with oil, tliey are a cure for ejji- %0anyctis, freckles, running sores, ulcers of the mouth, and scaly %0aeruptions. The juice of the berries is curative of porrigo %0aand phthiriasis ; and for pains in the ears, or hardness of hear¬ %0aing, it is injected into those organs with old wine and oil of %0aroses. All venomous creatures fly at the approach of persons %0awho have been anointed with this juice: taken in drink, the %0ajuice of the small-leaved®^ laurel in particular, it is good for %0astings inflicted by them. The berries,®® used with wine, neu¬ %0atralize the venom of serpents, scorpions, and spiders; they %0aare applied also, topically, with oil and vinegar, in diseases of %0athe spleen and liver, and with honey to gangrenous sores. In %0acases of lassitude and shivering fits, it is a very good plan to %0arub the body with juice of laurel-berries mixed with nitre. %0aSome persons are of opinion that delivery is accelerated by %0ataking laurel-root to the amount of one acetabulum, in water, %0aand that, used fresh, it is better than dried. It is recommended' %0a%0a“ Irino.” See B. xiii. c. 2. %0a%0aThis assertion, Fee says, is untrue. %0a%0aSee B. XT. c. 39. %0a%0aAll these statements as to the properties of the berries, Fee says, are %0ahypothetical and more than doubtful. %0a%0aL L 3 %0a%0a%0a518 %0a%0a%0apliny’s natubal histoet. %0a%0a%0a[Book XXIII. %0a%0a%0aby some authorities, to take ten of the berries in drink, for %0athe sting of the scorpion; and in cases of relaxation of the %0auvula, to boil a quarter of a pound of the berries, or leaves, %0ain three sextarii of water, down to one third, the decoction %0a, being used warm, as a gargle. For head-ache, also, it is re¬ %0acommended to bruise an uneven number of the berries in oil, %0athe mixture being warmed for use. %0a%0aThe leaves of the Delphic laureP® bruised and applied to the %0anostrils from time to time, are a preservative®' against conta¬ %0agion in pestilence, and more particularly if they are burnt. %0aThe oil of the®® Delphic laurel is employed in the preparation %0aof cerates and the medicinal composition known as “acopum,”®® %0aand is used for fits of shivering occasioned by cold, for the %0arelaxation of the sinews, and for the cure of pains in the side %0aand the cold attacks in fevers.™ Warmed in the rind of a %0apomegranate, it is applied topically for the cure of ear-ache. A %0adecoction of the leaves boiled down in water to one third, used %0aas a gargle, braces the uvula, and taken in drink allays pains %0ain the bowels and intestines. The more tender leaves, bruised %0ain wine and applied at night, are a cure for pimples and %0aprurigo. %0a%0aThe other varieties of the laurel ‘possess properties which %0aare nearly analogous. The root of the laurel of Alexandria,'” %0aor of Mount Ida,’'® accelerates delivery, being administered in %0adoses of three denarii to three cyathi of sweet wine; it acts %0aalso as an emmenagogue, and brings away the after-birth. %0aTaken in drink in a similar manner, the wild laurel, known as %0a“ daphnoides ” and by the other names which we have men¬ %0ationed,''® is productive of beneficial effects. The leaves of it, %0aeither fresh or dried, taken in doses of three drachmae, in %0ahydromel with salt, act as a purgative''* upon the bowels. %0a%0aThe Lauras nobilis of modern botany. %0a%0aA statement, F ee says, that is altogether illusory. %0a%0aOf the berries.

They impart an agreeable smell’® to the %0abreath, even when eaten the day before; thus, for instance, in %0aMenander we find the S3maristosEe’® eating them. They are %0ataken also for dysentery,®® in doses of one denarius, in wine : %0aand they are employed lukewarm, in wine, for the cure of %0aobstinate ulcers on the extremities. Mixed with polenta, they %0aare employed topically in ophthalmia, and for the cardiac %0adisease®' they are applied to the left breast. For stings in¬ %0aflicted bj’^ scorpions, diseases of the bladder, head-ache, and %0afistulas of the eye before suppuration, they are similarly em¬ %0aployed ; and for tumours and pituitous eruptions, the kernels %0aare first removed and the berries are then pounded in old %0awine. The juice of the berries®® acts astringently upon the %0abowels, and is diuretic: mixed with cerate it is applied topi¬ %0acally to blisters, pituitous eruptions, and wounds inflicted by %0athe phalangium ; it imparts a black tint,®® also, to the hair. %0a%0a%0aof the Daphne mezereum, and of the Daphne laureola; and in Aragon %0aand Catalonia, the leaves of the Thymelea are used for a similar purpose. %0aThe employment of them, however, is not unattended with danger. %0a%0a■® A variety with white berries, hut which variety it appears impossible %0a%0a%0ato say. %0a%0aSee B.

This %0apowder is used as an ingredient, also, in the.plasters known as %0a“ liparae j”®® and for the same reason the oil of the leaves is %0aused for a similar purpose, being extremely efficacious as an %0aapplication to the hiunid parts of the body, the mouth and the %0auterus, for example. %0a%0aThe leaves themselves, beaten up with wine, neutralize®® the %0abad effects of fungi; and they are employed, in combination %0awith wax, for diseases of the joints, and gatherings. A decoc¬ %0ation of them, in wine, is taken for dysentery and dropsy. %0aDried and reduced to powder, they are sprinkled upon ulcers %0aand haemorrhages. They are useful, also, for the removal of %0afreckles, and for the cure of hang-nails,®’ whitlows, condylo- %0amata, affections of the testes, and sordid ulcers. In combination %0awith cerate, they are used for burns. %0a%0aFor purulent discharges from the ears, the ashes of the %0aleaves are employed, as well as the juice and the decoction : %0athe ashes are also used in the composition of antidotes. For a %0asimilar purpose the blossoms are stripped from off the young %0abranches, which are burnt in a furnace, and then pounded in %0awine. The ashes of the leaves, too, are used for the cure of %0aburns.

The root of it is held in high esteem ; a %0adecoction of it, in wine, is taken for pains in the kidneys and %0astrangury, more particularly when the urine is thick and %0afetid. Pounded in wine, it is employed for the cure of jaun¬ %0adice, and as a purgative for the uterus. The same method is %0aadopted, also, with the young shoots, which are sometimes %0aroasted in hot ashes and eaten as a substitute for asparagus.®* %0a%0aThe berries, taken with wine, or oil and vinegar, break %0acalculi®* of the bladder: beaten up with rose-oil and vinegar, %0athey allay head-ache.

( 1 .) -INTRODUCTION. %0a%3c %0a%3c We have now set forth the various properties, medicinal or %0a%3c otherwise, as well of the cereals as of the other productions %0a%3c which lie u[)Oid the surface of the earth, for the purpose either %0a%3c of serving us for food, or for the gratification of our senses %0a%3c with their flo\vers or perfumes. lu the trees, however, %0a%3c Pomona has entered the lists with them, and has imparted %0a%3c certain medicinal properties to the fruits as they hang. Kot con¬ %0a%3c tent with protecting and nourishing, under the shadow of the %0a%3c trees, the various plants which w'e have* already described, %0a%3c slie would even appear to be indignant, as it were, at the %0a%3c thought that w'^e should derive more succour from those pro¬ %0a%3c ductions which are further removed from the canopy of heaven, %0a%3c and which have only come into use in times comparative!}' re¬ %0a%3c cent. For she bids man bear in mind that it was the fruits of %0a%3c the trees wliich formed his fii’st nourishment, and that it was %0a%3c tliose which first led him to look upwards towards the heavens: %0a%3c and not only this, but she reminds him, too, that even still it %0a%3c is quite possible for him to derive his aliment from the trees, %0a%3c without being indebted to grain for his subsistence. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 2 . -THE VINE. %0a%3c %0a%3c But, by Hercules ! it is the vine more particularly to wdiich %0a%3c she has accorded these medicinal properties, as though she %0a%3c were not contented with her generosity in providing it w'ith %0a%3c such delicious flavours, and perfumes, and essences, in its om- %0a%3c phacium, its oenanthe, and its massaris, preparations upon %0a%3c which W'e have already® enlarged. “ It is to me, she says, %0a%3c “ that man is indebted for the greater part of his enjoyments, %0a%3c %0a%3c • In contradistinction to the fruits which hang from trees. %0a%3c %0a%3c * See B. xvii. c. 18. ® In xii. cc. 60 and 61. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 458 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c PLINy’s NA.TUUAL UI3T0IIY. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [liook XXIII, %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c it is I that produce for him tlie flowing wine and the trickling %0a%3c oil, it is I that ripen the date and other fruits in numhers so %0a%3c varied ; and all this, not insisting, like the earth, on their pur¬ %0a%3c chase at the cost of fatigues and labours. No necessity do I %0a%3c create for ploughing with the aid of oxen, for beating out %0a%3c upon the threshing-floor, or for bruising under the millstone, %0a%3c and all in order that man may earn his food at some indefinite %0a%3c time by this vast expenditure of toil. As for me, all my gifts %0a%3c are presented to him ready prepared: for no anxieties or %0a%3c fatigues do they call, but, on the contrary, they offer them¬ %0a%3c selves spontaneously, and even fall to the ground, if man %0a%3c should be too indolent to reach them as they hang.” Vying %0a%3c even with herself, Pomona has done still more for our juac- %0a%3c tical advantage than for the mere gratification of our pleasures %0a%3c and caprices. [ %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 3.—THE LEAVES AND SHOOTS OF THE VINE : SEVEN %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c REMEDIES. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ^The leaves and shoots of the vine, employed with polenta, %0a%3c allay head-ache and reduce inflammations :® the leaves, too, %0a%3c applied b}' themselves with cold water, are good for burning %0a%3c pains in the stomach ; and, used with barley-meal, are excel¬ %0a%3c lent applications for diseases of the joints. The shoots, beaten %0a%3c up and applied, have the property of drying up all kinds of %0a%3c running tumours, and the juice extracted from them is used %0a%3c as an injection for the cure of dysentery. The tears of the %0a%3c vine, M^hich would appear to be a sort of gum, will heal le¬ %0a%3c prous sores, lichens, and itch-scabs, if treated first with nitre : %0a%3c used with oil, and applied frequently to superfluous hairs, they %0a%3c act as a depilatory, those more particularly which exude from %0a%3c tlie vine when burnt in a green state : this last liquid has the %0a%3c effect, too, of removing warts.

Being of a cooling, astringent nature, %0a%3c it is used for sprinkling upon sores, and is employed as a to¬ %0a%3c pical application for diseases of the stomach. It acts also as a %0a%3c diuretic, and is good for maladies of the liver, head-ache, %0a%3c dysentery, cceliac afi'ections, and attacks of cholera ; for nausea, %0a%3c it is taken in doses of one obolus in vinegar. It acts as a desic¬ %0a%3c cative upon running eruptions of the head, and is extremely %0a%3c efiicacious for maladies of the humid parts of the body ; hence %0a%3c it is that it is employed, with honey and saffron, for ulcers of %0a%3c the mouth, and for diseases of the generative organs and the %0a%3c fundament. It arrests looseness of the bowels, and heals erup¬ %0a%3c tions of the eyelids and runnings at the eyes : taken with M’ine, %0a%3c it cures derangements of the stomach, and with cold Avater, %0a%3c spitting of blood. %0a%3c %0a%3c The ashes of cenanthe are highly esteemed as an ingredient %0a%3c in eye-salves, and as a detergent for ulcers, whitlows, and %0a%3c hang-nailsto obtain these ashes, it is put into an oven, and %0a%3c left there till the bread is thoroughly baked. %0a%3c %0a%3c Saracemis, upon Dioscorides, B. v. c. 6, thinks that Pliny, in copying %0a%3c from the Greek, has made a mistake hei'e, and that he lias taken ovXuv, %0a%3c the “gums,” for ov\t), u “cicatrix;” the corresponding passage in %0a%3c Dioscorides being ovXa TrXaSupa, “flaccidity,” or “humidity of the %0a%3c gums.” %0a%3c %0a%3c In B. xii. c. 61.

The %0a%3c white grapes, on the other hand, are sweeter, for, being trans¬ %0a%3c parent, the air penetrates them with greater facility. %0a%3c %0a%3c Grapes fresh gathered are productive of flatulency, and dis¬ %0a%3c turb the stomach and bowels; hence it is that the}' are avoided %0a%3c in fevers, in large quantities more ])articularly. Indeed, they %0a%3c are very apt to produce oppression of the head, and to bring on %0a%3c the malady known as lethargy.” Grapes which have been %0a%3c gathered, and hdt to hang for some time, are much less'® hiju- %0a%3c rioiis, the exposure to the air rendering them beneficial even to %0a%3c the stomach, and refreshing to the patient, as they are slightly %0a%3c cooling, and tend to remove nausea and qualmishness. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 7 . -VARIOUS KINDS OF PRESERVED GRAPES : ELEVEN %0a%3c %0a%3c FtEMEDIES. %0a%3c %0a%3c Grapes which have been preserved in w'ine or in must are %0a%3c tri'ing to the head, Next to the grapes which have been left %0a%3c to hang in the air, are those which have been kept in chaff; %0a%3c but as to those which have been preserved among grape husks, %0a%3c they are injuriousto the head, the bladder, and the stomach. %0a%3c %0a%3c See B. xii. c. 61. It was prepared from vine-blossoms gathered in %0a%3c Africa. %0a%3c %0a%3c Tills remark is founded, in a great measure, upon fact. The skin of %0a%3c the black grape contains a colouring principle in consider.able abundance, %0a%3c and a small proportion of tannin ; that of tlie white grape possesses no %0a%3c colouring principle, but a considerable quantity of tannin. The white %0a%3c grape contains more saccharine matter than the black one, and they aro %0a%3c both of them of a laxative nature. %0a%3c %0a%3c ” Little remarks, that under the name of “ lethargus,” a febrile m.alady %0a%3c is probably meant, which belongs p>'obably to the class of pseudo-con¬ %0a%3c tinuous fevers. %0a%3c %0a%3c Fee thinks that in reality there can be little or no difference in rheir %0a%3c effects, but that, being eaten in larger quantities at the vintage than after¬ %0a%3c wards, it stands to reason that the result will be different. %0a%3c %0a%3c ’s The fermentation, producing a certain amount of alcohol, would %0a%3c naturally produce this result. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 462 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Pliny’s natuhal uistouy. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Buok XXIII. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c though at the same time they arrest looseness of the bowels, %0a%3c and are extremely good for patients troubled with spitting of %0a%3c blood.

It has a black, ujmight stem, with %0a%3c leaves resembling those of the labrusca,^ and bears what we may %0a%3c call a pod,^’ rather than a grape, green, similar to a chick-pea %0a%3c in appearance, and enclosing a kernel of triangular form. The %0a%3c fruit of it ripens with the vintage and turns black, while the %0a%3c berries of the taminia,^® as is well known, are red ; this last, %0a%3c too, as we are aware, grows only in shaded spots, while the %0a%3c wild astaphis, on the other hand, loves a site that is exposed %0a%3c to the sun. %0a%3c %0a%3c I Avould not recommend any one to use the kernels’'' of the %0a%3c wild astaphis as a purgative, as it is very doubtful whether they %0a%3c might not choke the patient; nor would I advise them to be %0a%3c employed for the purpose of attenuating the phlegm, as they %0a%3c are extremelj’^ irritating to the throat. Ileaten up, however, and %0a%3c applied topically, they kill vermin''® in the head and other parts %0a%3c of the body, more particularly if they are used with sanda- %0a%3c rach; they are very useful, too, for itch-scabs and prurigo. A %0a%3c decoction of the kernels is made with vinegar, for the cure of %0a%3c tooth-ache, diseases of the ears, cicatrices^' that are slow in %0a%3c healing, and running sores. %0a%3c %0a%3c The blossoms of the plant are beaten up and taken in wine %0a%3c %0a%3c ^ Identified with the Delphinium staphis agria of Linnajus. %0a%3c %0a%3c “Taininian grape.” Or wild vine. %0a%3c %0a%3c The fruit is formed of three ohlong capsules, containing a triangular %0a%3c seed of black hrown colour, about the size of a kidney bean. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is not the white vine or bryony, mentioned in c. 16 of this %0a%3c Book, but the Tamus communis of Linnaeus. %0a%3c %0a%3c The seeds, which are remarkably pungent and powerful in tlicir %0a%3c eflfects, are only used, at the present day, in medicinal preparations for %0a%3c cattle. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is still done at the present day; to which it is indebted for its* %0a%3c French name I’herbe pediculaire, or louse-plant. %0a%3c %0a%3c Pliny seems again to have fallen into the error , of mistaking ov\ov, %0a%3c the “ gums ” for oo\/), a “cicatrix the corresponding passage in Dios- %0a%3c corides, B. iv. c.

The twigs of this tree are %0a%3c jointed, thin, and climbing, with considerable interstices be¬ %0a%3c tween the knots.®‘ The leaves, attached to the numerous %0a%3c shoots, and about the size of an ivy leaf, are jagged at the %0a%3c edges, like that of the vine. The root of it is large and white, %0a%3c and very like a radish®’^ at first; from it issue several steins, %0a%3c similar to asparagus in appearance. These stems, eaten boiled, %0a%3c are both purgative and diuretic. The leaves, too, as well as %0a%3c the stems, are possessed of caustic®® properties; for which %0a%3c reason they are employed topically with salt, for phagedaenic %0a%3c sores, gangrenes, and putrid ulcers of the legs. The fruit of %0a%3c the tree is in the form of grapes thinly scattered, the juice of %0a%3c which is red at first, and afterwards of a saffron colour.

For my own %0a%3c part, with all that gravity which becomes a Roman, and one %0a%3c zealous for the furtherance of liberal pursuits, I shall enter into a %0a%3c careful examination of this subject, not, indeed, in the cha¬ %0a%3c racter of a physician, but as a careful investigator of the %0a%3c effects which wine is likely to produce upon the health of man¬ %0a%3c kind. To treat, however, of the medicinal properties of each %0a%3c individual kind, would be a labour without end, and quite in¬ %0a%3c exhaustible ; the more so, as the opinions of medical men are %0a%3c so entirely at variance upon the subject. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 20. -THE SUKRENTINE AVINES : THREE REMEDIES. THE %0a%3c %0a%3c ALBAN WINES : TWO REMEDIES. THE FAIERNIAN WINES : SIX %0a%3c %0a%3c REMEDIES. %0a%3c %0a%3c Our ancestors set the highest value upon the wines of %0a%3c Surrentum but at a later period the preference was given %0a%3c to the Alban, or the Falernian wines. More recently, again, %0a%3c other varieties of wine have come into fashion, quite in accord¬ %0a%3c ance with that most unreasonable mode of proceeding, ac¬ %0a%3c cording to which, each person, as he finds a wine most to his %0a%3c taste, extols it as superior to all others. Suppose, now, that all %0a%3c persons were quite agreed as to the superiority of some par¬ %0a%3c ticular kind of wine, how small a proportion of mankind %0a%3c would be enabled to make use of it! As it is, even the rich never %0a%3c drink it in an unsophisticated state; the morals of the age %0a%3c being such, that it is the name only of a vintage that is sold, %0a%3c the wines being adulterated the very moment they enter the %0a%3c vat. Hence it is, by Hercules !—a thing truly astounding— %0a%3c that, in reality, a Avine is more innoxious in its effects, in pro¬ %0a%3c portion as it enjoys a less extended renoAvn. The three kinds, %0a%3c however, of which we have made mention, appear to have %0a%3c maintained, with the least diminution, their ancient repute. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Falernian Avine, if a person should be desirous to know %0a%3c the marked characteristics of Avines according to age, is in¬ %0a%3c jurious to the health, either too new or too old; at fifteen %0a%3c %0a%3c “ Cognoniinatum” appears to be a better reading than “ cognomi- %0a%3c natus,” Avbich Sillig has adopted; as it is much more probable that the %0a%3c work received its name from the subject than that the writer did. %0a%3c %0a%3c All these wines are described in B. xiv. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 22.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c OTnER WIIJES. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 471 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c years it begins to be of medium age.

For an inveterate cough and for quartan fevers, it is %0a%3c a good plan to drink it neat, fasting. There is no wine that %0a%3c (juickens the action of the venous system so much as this ; it %0a%3c acts astringently upon the bowels, and is feeding to the body. %0a%3c It has been thought, however, that this wine is productive of %0a%3c injurj' to the sight, and that it is far from beneficial to the %0a%3c nerves’® and the bladder. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Alban wines are more salutary to the nervous system, %0a%3c but the sweet kinds are not so beneficial to the stomach. The %0a%3c rough wines of Alba are even better than those of Falernum, %0a%3c but they do not promote the digestion so well, and have a %0a%3c slight tendency to overload the stomach. %0a%3c %0a%3c As to the Surrentine wines, they have no such effect upon %0a%3c the stomach, nor are they at all trying to the head ; they have %0a%3c the property also of arresting defluxions of the stomach and %0a%3c intestines.

It is w'ine that makes up for all %0a%3c the difference between the middle or temperate zone, and those %0a%3c which lie on either side of it, the juice of the vine conferring %0a%3c as much vigour and robustness upon the inliabitants of our %0a%3c part of the earth as the rigorousness” of the climate does %0a%3c %0a%3c 75 %3c1 Nervis.” As to the meaning of this word, see B. xi. c. 88. %0a%3c %0a%3c '‘® These wines also are described in B. xiv. %0a%3c %0a%3c u “ Feritas.’* %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 472 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c PLlNl’s NATUEAL IIISTOEV. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Look XXII I. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c upon tlie people there. Milk, used as a beverage, strengthens %0a%3c the bones, liquids extracted from the cerc'als nourish the %0a%3c sinews, and water imparts nutriment to the flesh : hence it is %0a%3c that persons who confine themselves to these several liquids as %0a%3c a beverage, are of a less ruddy complexion than the wine- %0a%3c drinker, less robust, and less able to endure fatigue. By the %0a%3c use of wine in moderation the sinews are strengthened, but %0a%3c taken in excess it proves injurious to them; the same, too, %0a%3c with the eyes. Wine refreshes the stomach, sharpens the %0a%3c appetite, takes off the keen edge of sorrows and anxieties, %0a%3c warms the body, acts beneficially as a diuretic, and invites %0a%3c sleep. In addition to these properties, it arrests vomiting, and %0a%3c we find that pledgets of wool, soaked in wine, and applied to %0a%3c abscesses, are extremely beneficial. According to Asclepiades, %0a%3c the virtues possessed by wine are hardly equalled by the ma¬ %0a%3c jestic attributes of the gods themselves. %0a%3c %0a%3c Old wine bears admixture with a larger quantity of water, and %0a%3c acts more powerfully as a diuretic, though at the same time it %0a%3c is less effectual for quenching thirst. Sweet wine, again, is %0a%3c less inebriating, but stays longer on the stomach, while rough %0a%3c wine is more easy of digestion. The wine that becomes mcd- %0a%3c low with the greatest rapidity is the lightest, and that which %0a%3c becomes sweeter the older it is, is not so injurious to tlie %0a%3c nerves. Wines that are rich and black,’® are not so bene¬ %0a%3c ficial to the stomach ; butj at the same time, they are more %0a%3c feeding to the body. Thin-bodied rough wines are not so %0a%3c feeding, but are more wholesome to the stomach, and pass %0a%3c off more speedily by urine, though they are all the more %0a%3c liable to fly to the head; a remark which will apply, once for %0a%3c all, to liquids of every kind. %0a%3c %0a%3c Wine that has been mellowed by the agency of smoke is %0a%3c extremely unwholesome—a fraudulent method of preparation %0a%3c that has been invented in the wine-lofts’® of the retail dealers. %0a%3c At the present day, however, this plan is adopted in private %0a%3c families even, when it is wished to give the appearance of ma¬ %0a%3c turity to wines that have become carious.®® Indeed, this term %0a%3c carious has been used very appositely by the ancients wfith %0a%3c reference to wines ; for we find that in the case of wood even, %0a%3c smoke exercises a caustic effect upon the carious parts, and %0a%3c %0a%3c ''® The colour of our Port. %0a%3c %0a%3c “ Aputhcuis.” %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c •"O “ Caricm trahunt.’ %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 23.] OB3ERVATIOK8 EELATIVE TO WINE. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 473 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c eats them awaj'-; and yet we, on the other hand, persuade %0a%3c ourselves tliat an adventitious age may be imparted to wines %0a%3c by the bitter twang derived from smoke !®‘ %0a%3c %0a%3c Those wines which are extremely pale, become more whole¬ %0a%3c some the older they are.

Vinegar has the effect also of %0a%3c dissolving coagulated blood ; for the cure of lichens, it is used %0a%3c both internally and externally. Used as an injection, it ar¬ %0a%3c rests looseness of the bowels and fluxes of the intestines; it is %0a%3c similarly employed, too, for procidenceof the rectum and utei’us. %0a%3c %0a%3c Vinegar acts as a cure for inveterate coughs, defluxions of %0a%3c the throat, hardness of breathing, and looseness of the teeth: %0a%3c but it acts injuriously upon the bladder and the sinews, when %0a%3c relaxeil. Medical men were for a long time in ignorance how %0a%3c beneficial vinegar is for the sting of the asp ; lor it was only %0a%3c recently that a man, while carrying a bladder^ of vinegar, hap¬ %0a%3c pening to be stung by an asp upon which he trod, found to his %0a%3c surprise that whenever he put down the bladder he felt the sting, %0a%3c but that when he took it up again, he seemed as though he %0a%3c had never been hurt; a circumstance which at once suggested %0a%3c to him the remedial properties of the vinegar, upon drinking %0a%3c some of which he experienced a cure.

If a person, after taking off everything %0a%3c that is fastened upon the body, his girdle, for instance, shoes, %0a%3c and even his ring, plucks one of them with two fingers of %0a%3c the left hand, the thumb, namely, and the fourth finger, and, %0a%3c after rubbing it gently round his eyes, puts it into his mouth %0a%3c and swallows®’ it without letting it touch his teeth, he will %0a%3c experience, it is said, no malady of the eyes throughout all %0a%3c the year. These germs, dried and pounded, check the growth %0a%3c of fleshy excrescences; they are good also for the gums and %0a%3c teeth ; and if the teeth are loose a decoction of the germs will %0a%3c strengthen them. %0a%3c %0a%3c The young pomegranates ®® themselves are beaten up and %0a%3c applied as a liniment to spreading or putrid sores; they are %0a%3c used also for inflammations of the eyes and intestines, and %0a%3c nearly all the purposes for which pomegranate-rind is used. %0a%3c They are remedial also for the stings of scoipions. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 60. —BALAUSTIUM : TWELVE REMEDIES. %0a%3c %0a%3c "We cannot sufficiently admire the care and diligence dis¬ %0a%3c played by the ancients, who, in their enquiries into every %0a%3c subject, have left nothing untried.

The milk of %0a%3c the fig-tree is naturally curative of the stings of hornets, %0a%3c wasps, and similar insects, and is remarkablj’useful for wounds %0a%3c inflicted by scorpions. Mixed with axle-grease it removes %0a%3c warts. With the leaves and figs still greeu an application is %0a%3c made for scrofulous and other sores of a nature which requires %0a%3c emollients or resolvents. The leaves, too, used by themselves, %0a%3c are productive of a similar effect. In addition to this, they %0a%3c are employed for other purposes, as a friction for lichens, for %0a%3c example, for alopecy, and other diseases which require caustic %0a%3c applications. The j'oung shoots of the branches are used as %0a%3c an application to the skin in cases of bites inflicted by dogs. %0a%3c With hone)' they are ajjplied to the ulcers known as honey¬ %0a%3c comb ulcers mixed with the leaves of wild poppies they ex¬ %0a%3c tract’® splinters of bones; and the leaves beaten up in vinegar %0a%3c are a cure for bites inflicted by dogs.

This juice, %0a%3c however, very soon breeds worms. %0a%3c %0a%3c Among ourselves, too, the juice which exudes from the %0a%3c mulberry-tree is employed for an equal number of purposes : %0a%3c taken in wine, it neutralizes the noxious effects of aconite^ and %0a%3c the venom of spiders, relaxes the bowels, and expels tape¬ %0a%3c worm and other animals which breed in the intestines the %0a%3c bark of the tree, pounded, has also a similar effect.

There is no medica¬ %0a%3c ment known that is more soothing than this, for affections of %0a%3c the mouth, the trachea, the uvula, and the stomach. There %0a%3c is also another mode of preparing it; two sextarii of mulberry %0a%3c juice and one of Attic honey are boiled down in the manner %0a%3c above stated. %0a%3c %0a%3c There are some other marvellous properties, also, which are %0a%3c mentioned in reference to this tree. AYhen the tree is in bud, %0a%3c and before the appearance of the leaves, the germs of the fruit %0a%3c must be gathered with the left hand—the Greeks give them %0a%3c the name of “ricini.”^® These germs, worn as an amulet %0a%3c before they have touched the ground, have the effect of arrest¬ %0a%3c ing haemorrhage, whether proceeding from a wound, from the %0a%3c mouth, from the nostrils, or from piles ; for which purposes %0a%3c they are, accordingly, put away and kept. Similar virtues %0a%3c are attributed to a branch just beginning to bear, broken off at %0a%3c full moon, provided also it lias not touched the ground : this %0a%3c branch, it is said, attached to the arm, is peculiarly efficacious %0a%3c for the suppression of the catamenia when in excess. The %0a%3c same effect is produced, it is said, when the woman herself %0a%3c pulls it off, whatever time it may happen to be, care being %0a%3c taken not to let it touch the ground, and to wear it attached to %0a%3c the body. The leaves of the mulberry-tree beaten up fresh, %0a%3c or a decoction of tliem dried, are applied topically for stings %0a%3c inflicted by serpents: an infusion of them, taken in drink, is %0a%3c equally efficacious for that purpose. The juice extracted from %0a%3c the bark of the root, taken in wine or oxycrate, counteracts %0a%3c the venom of the scorpion. %0a%3c %0a%3c We must also give some account of the method of preparing %0a%3c this medicament employed by the ancients : extracting the %0a%3c juice from the fruit, both ripe and unripe, they mixed it to¬ %0a%3c gether, and then boiled it down in a copper vessel to the con- %0a%3c %0a%3c ^ See B. xii. c. 60.
